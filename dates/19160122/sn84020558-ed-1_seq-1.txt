ARIZONA EASTERN BRIDGE AT
GILA HAS LOST EIGHT SPANS
Desperate Efforts to be
Made This Morning to
Connect Wires Lost When
Big Bridge Went Out
Night Before Last.
SERVICE TO START
SOON WITH FERRY
Santa Ee Announces Trains
Will Run as Usual Over
Main Line. Mianv Leave
for North Today. Tourists
to. Start West
One more span of the Arizona East
ern bridge across the Gila at Suva ton
went out yesterday :f einoon. This
makes a total of eight spans, or fitiO
feet of the big bridge gone by the
board.
The delay in the transportation of
passengers over the Arizona Eastern
will last but a few days longer, ac
cording to Superintendent Scott. He
has made arrangements to have a
ferry service in shape to lie used to
morrow. It is probable that the first
train to be run out to the bridge, will
start early tomorrow morning.
This morning an attempt is to be
'made to repair the broken wires at the
bridge. It is not known whether it
will be possible to get a boat across
but a desperate attempt is to be made.
Water Falling
The water of the Gila is falling fast.
Contrary to some reports, the Arizona
Eastern bridge is not built on huge
rocks placed in the river bottom. The
piers which support the structure are
placed on bed rock. The approaches
though are reinforced with huge rocks.
The water played havoc with them, al
most picking them up.
Winkelman Isolated
What damage has been done to the
tracks of the Arizona Eastern at Win
kelman cannot be ascertained i c
wires in that direction are all down
near Cochran,' where several hunureu
feet of track has been put out of com
mission. The track there runs along side of
the river. The water has come up over
it completely obscuring the right of
way. What damage has been done is
not known. It is- impossible to say
when it will be replaced.
No word has been received from
Kelvin. A gang of men will be sent
out this morning to repair the wires
in that locality. A report on conditions
there will probably be forthcoming
within a short time.
Santa Fe Service Resumes
The Santa Fe has announced that
service on the main line will be resumed
this morning. About 700 feet of track
on the main line near Winslow has
been out of commission for the past
two days, but arrangements have been
made to get passengers by. All tour
ists who have started for the west
are being held at Gallup, N. M. They
have been taken good care of there.
A Santa Fe train from the coast
reached here yesterday afternoon about
six hours late. The train leaving here
daily for Ash Fork at 5:35 p. m. will
be resumed today. There was no train
in from that place this morning.
Three trains will leave here over' the
Arizona Eastern today. One will go to
l'rice on the Florence line, one . to
fashion and one to Chandler.
Exodus North
Many people temporarily stranded
here, will leave this morning over the
i-anta I-e. for the east and El Paso.
Those going this morning will be the
first to get out in that direction for
some time. I
MEXICANS MAY HAVE DROWNED

SANTA ANA, Jan. 21 Reports were
received here today that eleven Mexi

been missing. The Muneze home at
Yorba was washed away. No trace
could be lound of the members of a
family of eight whose home at Coralda

The statement that I'hoenix is in a
flooded zone has ceased to be a fact.
The Bait River has practically decided
to give up the ghost and go down like
a good little river should. No watch
was kept on the Central" avenue bridge
last night; it was decided that things
there were all in ship shape.
Reclamation officials are still mak
ing trips around the project in an effort
to ascertain the extent of damage. A
report will be made to the office in i
Denver, before permission can be ob
tained to repair things.
Project Manager Cone started for
Roosevelt yesterday. He planned to
go to Fish Creek by auto, and there
switch to the back of a horse.
It was reported from Globe last even
ing that damage had been done to
the outlet sates of the dam. There
was a rumor current there that there
had been a rockslide, completely block
ing the closing of the gates. W hether
this is so or not, reclamation officials
refused to state.

Service was temporarily restored on
this route for a short time late yester
day but the Arizona and Eastern rail
road bridge which was already badly
damaged could not stand the constant
rush of the Gila river which is the
worst it has been in the history of
the telephone company's experience.
About ten o'clock last night the bridge
gave way in the span just south of
where it had already been washed out
and again took out all wires that cross
the river at this point. Early today
District Wire Chief E. .1. Anderson
of the Mountain States Telephone and
Telegraph company and a large force
of men were at the scene of the wash
out but found themselves almost help- j
less when attempt was made to re
store the service.
Logs, huge trees ana many other
kinds of debris were constantly com
ing down the river and it was con
sidered unsafe for men to even try to
cross the river in boats or in any oth
er way by which they would come in
contact with the current of the river.
All preparations have been made for
an early start tomorrow morning and
it is believed that wire service will be

BEHAVES
That the intake dam had been dam
aged though, was confirmed. What
the amount of the damage is has not
as yet been found out.
The overflow over the spillways has
dropped to 8.50 inches.
Several great sighs of relief have
been heaved by officials of the reclama
tion service. It was the luckiest thing
in the world in their opinion that the
flood subsided when it did. How ap
prehensive they were of a bad break
in the system will never be known.
But that they were severely scared is
not doubted. During the entire period
of danger they kept up a good front,
and never even allowed the newspaper
men in on the real danger.
The power house at Roosevelt is still
out of commission. Neither the build
ing or machinery has been damaged
Water came uii a couple of feet into
ttje building. The generators were not
in any way harmed, and in a few days
normal conditions will be resumed.
So general and comprehensive was
the prostration of telegraph and tele
phone wires yesterday and last night
mented by a small report from Los
Angeles. The trouble began at 10
o'clock on Thursday night after sev
eral thousand words had been re
ceived. The report was followed by
late dispatches from Los Angeles,
which came by the Western Cnion.
.But yesterday and last night Western
Union w ires to the coast had ceased
to be available.
There was a slight chance until
early yesterday evening that an out
let might be established through
Globe, though that would not have
repaired the break in the leased wire.
Rut then came the gap cut by the
I flood into the Arizona Eastern near
Cochran, and after that all was silent
I in that direction. Later in the night
a solitary and heavily laden Western
t Cnion wire to Los Angeles brought in
a supplemental report'from the coast.
There had been some pretty serious
wire trouble before, but the three
wires of The Republican had managed
in one way or another to overcome
it, so that connection could either be
maintained with San Francisco or
else with Denver, and there was never
an interruption of more than a few
minutes with the leased wire reiKirt.
Now and then the shift from San
Francisco to Denver would be made
with such suddenness that a sentence
of the 'report begun in the former
would be completed in the 4atter.
On several occasions w ires w ere rigged
up between The Republican office
through the north and northwest by
way of Seattle.
But on Thursday night no shift of
any sort could be made and the situ
ation was not improved yesterday, but
assurance is given that unless some
thing unforscen happens the wires
will be restored today.
The most smashing trouble occurred
at the Gila crossing, and that re-

Paso late today.
The damage from the rain and snow
w.ll amount to several thousand dol
lars. Hundreds of telephone and tel
egraph poles were down, wires broken
and the weight of the snow caused
several buildings here to collapse. No
one was injured.
Snow in Bisbee
HISBEE, Ariz., Jan. 21. The worst
snowstorm in the history of this sec

Republican A. P. Leased 'Wire
LONDON, Jan. 21. The British
army today received a small but pic
turesue addition to its strength in a
group of thirty recruits from Hong
Kong. Five times since the war began
these men had petitioned the governor
of Hong Kong to be released from the
constabulary service in which they
were engaged in order that they might
go to England and enlist, but each
time their request was refused. Finally,
however, they received permission to
leave China and sailed for England.
Their appearance on the streets of
London was greeted with the greatest
interest and curiosity. Under thejr
khaki overcoats which were thrown
wide open, mostof the men wore the
blue uniforms with white piping of
the Hong Kong constabulary. Their
helmets were the winter service pat
tern of thick pith, with a steel spike
on top and a steel band running round
the side.

BRANDED FAKE

furniture was included in a sale at Earl
Cowley's residence, Shippenham, ac
cording to allegations made in a suit
to recover money filed here by a firm
of antique dealers against the firm of
auctioneers who bad conducted the
sale
A settee ascribed to Queen Anne's
time was branded an obvious fake, as
it looked on examination to be about
a year old. An "old cabinet tempus
Queen Anne" came from a factory of
antiques in London to judge by its
earmarks. An oak bed alleged to be of
the period of Charles II. was called
a fake and a poor fake at that.
The defense claimed the articles
were genuine and added that Lord
Cowley and his agent made up the
catalogue.

OVER TWO HUNDRED OF
ARIZONA STOCKMEN TO
ATTEND CONVENTION
Ii- Delegation Will Leave
I'hoenix Tonight Over
Santa Fe Augmented by
Car Loads From Prescott
and Ash Fork
More than two hundred strong, per
haps even reaching -three hundred,
members of the Arizona Livestock as
sociation will journey today and to
morrow to El Paso to be in atten
dance at the nineteenth annual con
vention of the national organization.
From Phoenix alone nearly fifty will
go out tonight in two special cars at
tached to the : 3 o train of the Santa
Fe railroad, going by way of Ash
Fork and Albuquerque. From Pres
cott a special car with upward of
twenty members will be attached to
the Santa Fe train leaving this city
this morning and reaching the Mile
High city about noon. Another spe
cial car will go forward today from
Ash Fork.
With Central Arizona, hampered by
flood conditions, making railroad
communication more than ordinarily
uncertain, sending out
delegation
that requires two cars to handle, and
Prescott and Northern Ariona likely
to send a like number. Southern Ari
ona, from which access to El Paso is
just now no serious problem, is ex
pected to send an even larger dele
gation than the remainder of the
state. This means that Ariona is
likely to be represented by more than j
two hundred voting members
voting members when i
the convention is called to order.
The importance of the nineteenth
annual convention was presented by
Secretary Sam B. Bradner of the Ari
ona association in conversation yes
terday. The national lease law, providing
for the leasing of federal lands for
range, will receive special attention
from the delegates, to the end that
the stockmen may have better guar
antees against encroachments upon
their improvements, said Mr. Bradner.
The question of market for beef cat
tle and means of remedying the pres
ent inability of the market to adjust
itself will be. gone into thoroughly.
There will be a committee appointed
to investigate the cause of the depres
sion of the market.
It is likely there will be a meeting
of the association with officers of the
federal bureau of animal industry' for
the promotion of co-operation with
the government in combating a
threatened new outbreak of the hoof
tnd mouth disease. A committee will
ilso be appointed to confer with the
railroads looking to the more expe
ditious movement of stock shipments.
General livestock legislation will re
ceive its full share of attention.
The local interest centers quite
largely about the probability of the
re-election of Dwight B. Heard to the
presidency of the national organiza
tion. The Arizona delegation will go
to the convention solidly for Presi
dent Heard, and there seems little
doubt but that he will be re-elected
bv a handsome vote.
The visiting stockmen, which will
include not only cattlegrowers of the
country, but a good representation of
sheepmen, or at least cattlemen who
ire likewise engaged in sheep raising,
will be right royally entertained by
the El Paso stockmen. There will be
receptions, banquets, visits to Juarez,
where a genuine bull fight may be on
the program; visits to various points
of interest in automobiles and drills
by the federal troops stationed at
Fort Bliss are among the most in
teresting things planned for the en
tertainment of the visitors.
The I'hoenix delegation will leave
this evening at 5:3,") o'clock in two
special cars over the Santa Fe rail
road. The party from here will be
personally conducted by Traveling
Passenger Agent C. B. Heid. The
train is scheduled to arrive at Albu
querque at 2:15 o'clock Sunday after
noon. A stay of over eight hours at
the New Mexico city is planned,
during which the stockmen of that
vicinity will entertain the travelers.
The start from Albuquerque will be
made at 10: 50 Sunday evening and
the train will arrive at El Paso at
10 o'clock Monday morning. The aft
ernoons will be devoted to entertain
ment and sight seeing. There will be
an all-day business session on Thurs
day.

Like Burton, he made pilgrimmages in
native guise both to Medina and Mecca.
It was at Medina that his identity was
j suspected and he was made to take an
' oath that he was a Musselman and to
i undergo a searching examination on

! from which he emerged successfully.
At this time, it is declared, Neufeld
j did a service to his country that
I brought its reward in this war. He
i spread the belief among the ignorant
Mohammedan populace that there were
I many Mohammedans in Germany. In
1 fact the current belief in Islam that
j the kaiser is the grand caliph of the
European Mohammedans and went to
I war to free them from Christian op
i pression is attributed to Neufeld's busy-
propaganda.
There is' a story that Neufeld re
cently went to Germany not only as
the bearer of valuable political and
military information for the German
government but also of a bottle of
miracle-working water from the sacred
Zem-Zem well at Mecca, given him by
the faithful as a cure for General von
Hindenburg's gout. According to the
traveler Burton, Zem-Zem water is bit
ter to the taste and causes diarrhoea
and boils, but the faithful say that it
not only restores health but brightens
the vision, physically and spiritually,

AH that is known about Neufeld's
activities comes from the German
papers, and for that reason they are
accepted as true by the British press,

particular and civilization in general,
they declare, that Neufeld is seeking
to destroy.
