'MEXIQANRUSTLER
' SHOOTS AMERICAN
Rancher at Ysleta, Texas,
Slain When He Tries to Recover
Stolen Cattle.
' TWO PUT UNDER ARREST
BY OFFICIALS AT JUAREZ
1 Tense Situation Produced at El
Paso, and Steps Arc Taken to Pre- j
vent Repetition of Riots.
j
EL, PASO. January 22.?The tense
situation- here, produced by the Santa
Ysabel massacre more than a week
ago. today was complicated when details
of the killing of Bert Akers. an
American rancher from Ysleta, Tex.,
became known. Akers was slain by
Bernardo I >uran. a Mexican cattle
rustler, in a fight that occurred yesterday
afternoon at San Lorenzo, Ghij
huahua. a village a few miles below
' the border. With a companion. Douglas
Downs, and a Mexican police official,
Akers sought to recover cattle stolen
last Monday from Mrs. Murphy, a
j neighbor at Ysleta. when Duran, with
| his brother. Frederico. opened fire from
! the roof of their house,
j Gen. Gabriel Gavira. commandant at
I Juarez, from headquarters gave out a
| statement which lie said covered the
i circumstances of the fight as they were
| related to him by Bernardo Duran and
j Irs brother, who participated in the
; shooting, and by a squad of Carranza
i soldiers, who were near the scene of
. I the fray, and who arrested the Mexicans.
(Jen. Gavira declared that Duran
claimed self-defense. The general said
that if found guilty the Durans would
: receive prompt punishment.
Akers Shot in the Back.
Akers was shot in the back while
t riding a horse that also carried his
companion, Douglas Downs. Downs
- readied Ysleta last night, several
hours after the shooting, ami reported
that the Duran brothers, one o? whom
is said to have served a term in the
state penitentiary of New Mexico, had
1 been running American cattle across
the border for the last few weeks. They
i wen- &aiu i iiiive ueeii niuiuaiew hi va[
j rious ways, such as cutting: off their
jears, to prevent identification.
Akers' body was brought to Juarez
early today for identification by a
squad of police sent out by Gen.
Ga vira.
[ Downs said they were trying to
get away from the Duran house when
they were tired on and that five Mexicans
followed them for several miles and fired
200 or more shots at thern before Akers
fell. Downs said he dropped off the horse
! and hid in a Mexican rancher's chicken
, ' coop, where he found a flint lock musket.
With this he prepared to defend himself,
but the slayers abandoned the chase.
Duran who was found leading the
horse on which the Americans had
tried to escape, declared he did not
know the men were Americans until he
examined the body of Akers. Mrs.
Akers, the widow, was notified of the
death of her husband, by Downs.
Steps to Prevent Riots.
Activities begun today in ?E1 Paso
among those interested in preventing
a repetition of the riotous demonstrations
that followed the massacre of
foreigners at Santa Ysabel January 10.
Civilian and military authorities were
early on the alert and plans were laid
to impress the people with the necessity
of remaining calm.
After examining the secret service officials
and two prisoners Gen. Gavira
at Juarez today gave out the following
statement:
"Three days ago two Americans appeared
at the office of the mayor and
; I ?1... owl etf rt rw.li.o tn
look for six or seven cows that had J
been stolen from them. One officer of j
the secret service was furnished.
"About 3 o'clock Friday afternoon
they went toward the place named San j
, Lorenzo, where they learned some cows i
were hidden.
"The Americans went to the house
, and knocked, one of the Durans answering.
He asked what they wanted. I
They told him they wanted to see the I
cows. Duran requested them to show
j | their authority.
Durans Begin Shooting.
"Tho Mexican officer said he did not
? have an orde- for search, but showed
his star. Duran than said he would
see what his brother thought of it, but
in a few moments the two Durans appeared
on the roof and began shooting
at. the visitors. The two Americans
and the Mexican officer returned the
i fire, at the same time backing away
in order to get their horses to flee.
The Duran brothers started in pursuit,
Fredenco Duran after the Mexican of'
fleer and Bernardo after 'he Americans.
One American reached his horse, but
- the Mexican officer could not get to
i his mount.
a "The Mexican officer was overtaken
" and relieved of his arms and badge.
f Duran exacted a pledge not to report
- the matter, and was taking the officer!
back to the house when a detachment
of soldiers, detailed on duty in the'
neighborhood, heard the shooting and |
- started to investigate. The sergeant'
1 in command apprehended Frederico
' Duran and the Mexican officer. Duran
e said lie had just killed an American
* in self-defense. He said he had pursued
' the two Americans about three miles
when be saw one of them fall. The
- other American jumped off his horse
and disappeared.
"The sergeant brought to general
headquarters in Juarez the whole
party."
raced Bandits Without Arms.
Thomas D. Edwards, American consul
in Juarez, said today that to the
best of his knowledge A hers and
Downs were not armed when they
went to the banuits stronghold.
"They came to me a few days ago
and I told them to go alone, unarmed,
across the river and find the cattle,
then to come to me ami I would get
an officer from (Jen. Gavira to go with
them. Apparently trey ooeyeo my instructions
in everything; except that
they pot the officer themselves. 1-iad

MAKES TENTATIVE DRAFTS
FOR TALKS IN THE WEST
Accompanied by Mrs. Wilson, and
May Stop at Fort Monroe
for a Game of Golf.
President and Mrs. Wilson aboard
the naval yacht Mayflower were cruising
leisurely today down the Potomac,
bound for the waters of Chesapeake
bay. The trip, which is to occupy two
days, was taken to enable the President
to prepare in seclusion the address
he is to make in New York January
27 at the Railroad Business Association's
banquet and to tentatively
draft others he is to make on national
preparedness on his middle western
trip.
Carries Mass of Information.
The President carried with him a
mass of data from the Navy and War
Departments which he was to use in
dictating the addresses to his stenographer.
The President plans to return '
here Monday morning. It is possible
he may stop at Fort Monroe for a 1
I golf game.
Neither Secretary Tumulty nor Dr. 1
Cary T. Grayson, the White House
physician, accompanied the President.

REMAINS A MYSTERY
Officers Know of No Explosion
Aboard the Freight Steamer
Sygna.
NEW .YORK, January 22. ? Mystery
surrounds the fire which forced the
Norwegian freight steamer Sygna to
put hack to this port today after having
sailed yesterday for Archangel
with a large cargo consigned to the
Ptitoi-i n pfivprnmcnt.
The fireboat William J. Gaynor met
the freighter at quarantine, and after
quantities of steam had been turned
into the Sygna's forehold, frOm which
clouds of smoke were pouring when
she reached port, it was believed the
fire was virtually under control.
Know of No Explosion.
Officers and members of the freighter's
crew said that so far as they knew
no explosion preceded the fire, but they
were unable to offer art explanation of
how the blaze originated in a hold
which they said contained only structural
steel and railway material.
The fire on the Sygna is the latest
of a long series of fires and explosions
which have occurred on vessels shortly
after they sailed from this and other
American ports with munitions or supplies
for the allies. In numerous cases
it has been found that the fires were
.aused by incendiary bombs or fuses,
but several of the cases have gone unexplained.
at least so far as the public
has been concerned.
No Munitions on Board.
Norton, Tally & Co., agents for the
Sygna, stated that the freighter did
not carry any munitions or highly inflammable
material, the cargo consisting
chiefly of steel, railway car parts
and wire.

may be taken up Tuesday, the

Although there is nothing definite
on whiib to base the prediction of a

centralize control of the schools in the
District government, there are two or
three members of the District committee
who believe the present bill will be

'j A movement is on <it in the
, convention >>l the National Security
League, which has heen in
L; session at the Acvv \\ iigircl
, Hotel for the past three days and
[ which will end tonight, to consolidate
all the increased militarv
| preparedness organizations of the
I lliled States under one head.
J Another movement is on foot
- for the league to send out through
' the country a great group of ptthi
lie speakers, especially through
1 the'middle west, to support the
statements President Wilson is
about to make as to the necessity
. for increased militarv preparedness
for the United States.
i Flans Carefully Discussed.
i These movements are tentative. It Is
understood, however, that they have
been the subject of prolonged discus"
sion in the committee on resolutions of
i the convention, and of informal oonferj
ences between officers of a number of
the organizations devoted to the subject
e
of increased military preparedness who
are now in Washington.
The proposed consolidation, as at pro?1
ent being discussed, would take in the
Navy League of the I'nited States; the
Army League of the I'nited States, the
recently formed American Legion,
which aims to acquire a roster of all
persons who formerly served in the
army and navy of the I'nited States, or
IIKMIY I,. STIMSO.%'.
who may he called upon to tak? up
arms in case the country should to
war, and which now has IS.ooo names
on its rolls; the military and nc.val
aeronautics branch of the Aero t'lub of
America, the military defense branch
of the Automobile Association of
America, the Woman's Section of the
Movement for Military Preparedness,
which is composed principally of the
woman's department of the National
Civic Federation, and includes the women
who organized the women's work
of the Belgian relief fund, and many
state and territorial organizations
throughout the United States and insular
possessions, such as the .Maryland
League for National Defense,
which is already affiliated with the National
Security League.
Not to Lose Identities.
Under the proposed plan of consolidation
the various organizations would
not lose the'r identities. The Navy
League would he the naval branch of
the bi? organization, the Army League
would be the army branch, etc. A
harmony of effort would be secured
by such a consolidation, officers of the
league said today, and much Expense
would be saved, an instance of which
I was cited in the case of an article by
Rear Admirai Bradley A. Fiske. U. S.
N.. on the-necessity for increased military
preparedness recently sent out by
several organizations t,o the public,
the sending of which involved a duplicate
or triplicate printing and postage
bill.
The tentative plans for sending ou?
speakers to arouse the country as to
the necessity for increasing military
preparedness, especially in the middle
west, wfiere there is said to be apathy
on the subject, included the suggestion
today that Gen. Luke E. Wright, former
Secretary of War, ant] chairman of the
resolutions committee of the convention,
might head such a list of speakers.
It was said that if the plan is
carried out the speakers would include
democrats as well as republicans. Other
speakers suggested were Gyrus North rup.
