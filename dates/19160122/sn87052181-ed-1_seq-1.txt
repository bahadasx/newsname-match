BEAT LIGHT BONDS
Proposal for a Municipal Plant
At Springfield Failed to
Get Enough Votes.
RAIN KEPT MANY FROM POLLS
A Total of 3,948 Ballots Were Cast,
2,051 For and 1,897 Against
the Proposition.

rain throughout tho day keeping many
from th5 polls. A stiff campaign, con
sisting of advertising and maBS meet
ings, had been waged by both sides
and an extra, largo vote was expected,
j as the registration several days ago
broke all records for a special elec

to meet any other obligations without

I 11 TURE MAKES DREAMS COME I lp I "
I TRUE. HE IS A SCIENTIST WHO I Wf' I
I SCORNS GUESSWORK METHODS I
By EDWARD D. CLARK.
OUSTON Is a man who Is
big enough to havo the
truth told about him."
Thoso were tho words
of a friend, a confidant
and an admlror ot David
Franklin Houston, secre
tary of agriculture In tho cabinet of'
Woodrow1 Wilson.
Tho Bocrctary's friend had no
thought of small traits in the charac
ter of Mr. Houston. What he meant
wa3 that certain things which havo
been dwelt upon by critics of tho tem
perament nnd tho methods of work ot
Mr. Houston, should bn set forth so
that tho proper light might fall upon
them and thus lay baro tho facts to
cyo and mind.
David Franklin has been criticized.
Why? Well, the answer Isn't hard.
Ho lit an Idealist who believes that his
Idealism can bo realized only after the
proof has been ndduced that It really
Is idealism. Consequently Mr. Hous
ton Is not a dreamer of dreams whoso
fabrics aro baseless. He Is of Scotch
blood and is hard headed, and as a
result a good many of tho visionaries
of the country who seo glory gilding
tho castles which thoy rear In tho air,
cannot understand why tho secretary
ot agriculture does not. Instantly seo
tho domes and minarets of their fan
cy's building "burning with tho splen
dor of noonday."
Tho department ot agriculture, since
Mr. Houston took hold ot It, has
broadened tho field of Its endeavors.
Many things havo been done. Some
of thorn are things which 'tho dream
ers of tho years have urged should be
done. Everything bearing a trace of
tho Imprint of worthiness that has
been suggested has been subjected to
tho tost of critical analysis. Socio of
tho dreamers havo been disappointed
bocauso this thing or that thing has
not beon dono, but thoy may know
that tho test has been applied and that
the rroof of lasting worthiness has
been lacking.
There seems to bo n sort of gonornl
Impression that Secretary Houston Is
a cold man. Tho presumption of his
coldness comes unquestionably from
tho fact that ho Is so Intensely scien
tific nnd analytical. The visionaries
go to him bubbling over with their
droams of what can be done to bring
tho millennium of their doslres to farm
and flold. Thoy nro so convinced that
tho vision thoy havo seen from the
mountain tops Is real that thoy count
the .man who listens but declines. In
Btant and exuberant acceptance of the
truth of their dreams, as u man who
is cold nnd unresponsive, Little do
they know, nt any rate for a long time,
that somo ot theso dream recitals nro
romembiired - and studied and that If
they bear up under tho study plans
are laid to make them a reality
Coldness Is an oster.lor thing. A

tary Houston was big enough to have
tho truth told about him also said that
the secretary Is a volcano, a seemingly,
slumbering ono, perhaps, but ono
which has within it tho potentialities
which ono usually ascribes to Vesu
vius and tho other peaks of fire. Men
who know the secretary cannot under
stand why ho Is called ecld. Tho rea
son Is simply that ho Is cold to the
representation of things whoso worth
cannot bo proved.
There Is another view ot Secretary
Houston which Is taken by somo men
who do not get next to him, or per
haps bettor. Into him. Generally
speaking, a man who has no sense of
humor Is an Impossible man. Some
persons think that tho secretary of ag
rlculturo lacks appreciation of real.hu
mor. Whilo Mr. Houston is of Scotch
descent, Sydney Umlth's Joko about
tho necessity ot a surgical operation
beforo you can got a Joko into a
Scotchman's skull has no application
to tho case of David F. Houston. He
is fonder of good stories and fonder
of telling them than perhaps any'Other
man In the president's cabinet It is
said ot hlin, however, that, true to his
temperament, ho analyzes a story to
find out first whether It has humor's
real Ingredients beforo ho will accept
It as ono worth retelling. In this way
tho secretary avoids tho fate of the
man who tells stories at which other
people laugh only because they feel
that they must do so In order to bo
complimentary to the raconteur.
To a Washington correspondent who
has boon watching things fairly close
ly In tho agricultural department, be
ciuso of an innate liking for things
agricultural, the chief thing to stand
out prominently slnco Mr. Houston
laid hand nn authority Is tho "tremen
dous amplification" of works which
wero In littlo moro than suggestive
form when ono admiuistratlun ot the
department was succeeded by another.
Secretary Houston found a lot of good
tilings In tRiitutivo form In tho agri
cultural department when ho first en
tered office. Ho submitted tho tenta
tive projects of his predecessor to
his usual aualysis and thoso which ho
found good ho adopted as scou as tho
study ot then was complete.
Tho growth of tho activities of tho
agricultural department of tho United
States slnco Mr. Houston has taken
hold Is ot tho kind usually called phe
nomenal. There Is no attempt on tho
part of tho secretary or my of his
subordinates to tako awuy from pro
ceding administrations tho credit for
Initiative). What was found to bo. good
has beon accepted as good, and what
Is moro, has been put Into operation.
Beyond this tho department has Initi
ated and carried Into action many
plans of Its own which at one timo
woro thought to bo Impossible of sue
cets. It Is in taking tho thing said to
bo impossible, In testing It and in ei
ther proving or disproving Its worth,
that tho present socretary excels.

F. Houston overmuch? Well, tho
proof or the disproof of the validity
of the pralso is to be found every
where through the farming .regions ot
tho United Statos. Nobody knows bet
ter than tho present-day fanner what
Mr. Houston has tried to do nnd has
done. Every housewife on tho form
will make, answer 'to the" question' as to
whothor pralso has -been wrongly
placed or not The records aro writ
ten over every field in tho United
States. Their pages easily are turned
and tho print Is 'largo.
Tho secretary of agriculture is a
blunt man when bluntness Is an es
sential to imparting a lesson. He does
not believe in mollifying men with,
soft words when hard words aro nec
essary. Politicians do not get any
great amount ot satisfaction out ot
him when they aro seoklng their own
ends. Hero Is a story in point that
was written -by Arthur W. Page.
"A member of congress from tho
mlddio West asked the secretary to
get rid of the department agent who
was at work In his district. Tho sec
retary refused. But that did not end
tho matter. A local attack hampered
tho work. Tho secretary investigated
the situation, satisfied himself that the
agent was not at fault and then
wrote to the member ot congress that
the work could not be done properly
while this attack was going on, and
that under tho circumstances the de
partment would withdraw from, tho
district altogether.
"He mailed a copy of this letter to
tho governor ot the state and to tha '
rest ot the congressional delegates
from that stato. They immediately
notified him that It would not bo nec
essary to withdraw the agent. Tho
stato legislature went even further,
and passed a unanimous resolution In
dorsing tho agricultural department's
work in tho stato."
Now it must bo understood that
when some members ot congress can
not do what they like In the way ot
Influencing the heads of the govern
ment departments thoy can resort, it
thoy wnnt to, to tho petty rovonge ot
opposing necessary appropriations for
enlarging the good work of tho depart
ment whoso secrotary has incensod
them. Socretary Houston never seems
to havo worried much about tho ap
propriation matter as it might be af
fected by the action ot men who "know
what thoy wanted and couldn't get it."
Tho truth is that tho motives of men
usually uru made plain when It comes
to antagonizing good work, nnd most
men aro afraid to havo their motives
turned to tho sun. Tho rosult is that
couraguous secietaries ot departments
in Washington usually have no troublo
because thoy have dared to stand out
against purely political Importunities.
David Franklin Houston was abso
lutely unknown In political circles
when President Wilson called him to
Washington. Ho was known, however,
to educators and to scientific men gen
erally all over the United States.
