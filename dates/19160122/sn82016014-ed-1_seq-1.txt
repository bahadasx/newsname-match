1'nited States district attorney and is'
one of t he st mneet a nd most able i

appointment as di. trict attorney to

Several days ago a telegram came to
Hrady from Washington asking if he i
would ac.-ept t he appointment to the

the job. "l appreciate the honor that,

I don't want to leave. Probably sev- i

Hrady is first assistant T'nited Ptates I

KNAPP ESTATE TO WIFE

St. Louis, Mo., Jan. 22. The inven

former president of the St. Louis- Hp

The rash items include a bonk rse

-' Kill You!"
Keporter Hears.
'Twas Only Thus!
"I have stood for your infidelity
Ions enough and now I am going
to kill you."
These words in a deep mascu
line tone awoke a newspaper re
porter with a start last night in
a room on West Kighth street in
Topeka.
I have neen lied about and
those charges are all untrue. Aly
Ood, put down that revolver."
This, in a pleading feminine voice
from an adjoining room.
By this time the reporter was
in the middle of the room, shak
ing with fear and debating which
of three policies would be wisest
- rush in and rescue the woman
in true, movie style, play ''safety
first" and sneak to a telephone or
permit the tragedy to go on and
be assured of a story for the next
day. Then came from thj mascu
line voice:
"Let's go over it again you
didn't get the right cup."
The bubble burst. Two actors

"We do not want to appropriate a

Horse Dies of
Cancer in Head
Chief Joseph Hanlon of the fire de

tificate with the city clerk, but "Ned.
the handsome sorrel at Station No. 5,
is dead. He was shot. Ned had been
suffering from cancer for five or six
years and it was feared that he would
go crazy any day. The cancer was
on the side of his head and had eaten
in almost to his brain. He suffered
intensely, according to veterinarians.
He was restive in his stall and found
it hard to stand still when he had
reached a fire but the faithful horse
never hesitated when it came to mak
ing a run He kept up his end of the
double-tree to the last.
Ned was one of a match-team and
Chief Hanlon doesn't know where to
get a horse that will match the one
left. Ned was purchased for the fire
department in September. 1906, and
had never been anywhere except at
Station No. 5. He was 1 5 years old.

CALLS IT A FAILURE
Ies Moines Councilman Says City
Government Is Costly ami lie
signs HU Position.
Des Moines, la., Jan. 22. The so
called Des Moines plan of city gov
ernment, which attracted much fa
vorable attention the country over
when it was adopted seven years ago,
is branded a failure by Councilman W.
F. Mitchell and a considerable per
centage of the citizens. Mitchell was
put into office to see if he couldn't re
organize at'lurs and make the plan
successful.
His resignation is tendered today,
effective this spring.
Mitchell says the city manager plan
should be adopted by Des Moines.
The bonded and floating indebtedness
of Des Moines has increased nearly
$1,000,000 since the plan was put in
force seven years ago. The plan was
heralded as one that would eliminate
partisan politics from all municipal
elections, place the responsibility for
the success or failure of the city gov
ernment upon the heads of the indiv
idual commissioners and generally
make for economy and efficiency.
Mitchell says politics has not been
eliminated and that financially the
plan has accomplished no good. Mitch
ell favors electing councilmen by dis
tricts rather than at large, paying
them for one meeting a week. He be
lieves all municipal executive control
should be vested in the city manager,
together with power to enforce all
laws and ordinances and to control all
city work. Mitchell believes this
would kill the political phase he be
lieves has made the old Des Moines
plan useless.
