Deputy Attorney General Har
dest (lives Decision in Mer
cantile Appraiser
AFFECTS A LLEGHENY
Other Counties Have the Same
Situation as Arose in
Dauphin County
In an opinion rendered to-dajr to
Auditor General A. W. Powell it is
held by Deputy Attorney General W.
M. Ilargest that assessments and ap
praisements made by Herman D. Hang,
elected mercantile appraiser of Dau
phin county by the county commis
sioners who assumed office on Jan
uary 3 after the election of Henry B.
Hoffman by the previous board had
been recalled, would be valid. This
decision affects similar situations in
Allegheny and four other counties in
the state where the new commission
ers recalled elections by their prede
cessors and chose new appraisers.
The opinion says that "the State is
not concerned as to who the mercan
tile appraiser is. but is concerned with
the validity of the assessments made,"
the Auditor (Jeneral having raised the
latter proposition.
Mr. Ilargest says "it is a familiar
rule of law that the acts of de facto
officers are valid so far as they affect
the public or third persons." He says
that in a case in which an attempt w9s
made to question the authority of a
ta\ collector said to have been illegally
appointed the court held "as against
and as respects all other persons, the
appointment bv the commissioners
gives authority de facto and de jure."
The commissioners in the Dauphin
and other county situations held that
under the Constitution appointed offl- '
cers with exception of judges and the
superintendent of public instruction I
may be removed at the pleasure of I
the power by which they shall have I
been appointed.
