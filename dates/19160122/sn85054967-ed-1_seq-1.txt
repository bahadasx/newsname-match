APPLICATIONS
WITHDRAWN
Brookville, Jan. 21 —The appli
cation of the Punxsutawney Brew
ing Company, the Elk Run Brew
ing Company and the AV. H. Heck
endorn Company, wholesale liquor
establishment, for licenses have
been withdrawn, says the Brook
ville correspondent of the Punxsu
tawney Spirit.
The attitude of the court, they
state, has convinced the attorneys
representing these applicants that
they are fighting a hopeless
case and the breweries withdrew
to apply for state license.
The position of the Punxsutaw
ney breweries and wholesale com
panies is different only from the
other applicants in that the latter
are determined to fight it out to a
finish. None could be found who
will withdraw his application, but
likewise none could be found who
believes he has one chance in a
thousand of securing a license.

INDIANA MAN PROVES
HIMSELF A HERO—THE
STCRY OF INTEREST HERE
R. AV. AVehrle, of South Fifth
street, has received a newspaper
which tells the following story of
iuterest to local people:
'"Yesterday afternoon (January
7) as George W. Sloop and son.
Kenneth, were bunting rabbits in
the Santa Ana Canyon they shot
a lynx. The animal made a spring
for the boy and missed him and
was preparing for a second leap
as Mr. Shoop shot it in the back of
the neck with his shotgun.
"The hunters were out for rab
bits and were making quiet pro
gress through the long grass when
the lynx made the first leap. It
was unexpected and only presence
of mind saved the young hunter
from harm. Lynx are not plenti
ful and the shot yesteday by Mr.
Shoop was a good one both as to
the saving of his son from injur
ies and the fine rug that can be
made from the hide. The animal
weighed less than twenty pounds
and was three feet in length.
Mr. Sloop and Mr. AVehrle were
close friends when the former re
sided here and knowing Wehrle's
fondness for nature stories and
pictures Mr. Sloop sent the picture
and the clipping here.
