PRESIDENT ARRANGES HIS
SPEAKING TOUR ITINERARY
National Security League Attacks
Mr. Wilson's Military
Policy.
Washington, Jan. 21.—Attacks up­
on the defense of the administration's
preparedness policy today again
marked the session of the National
Security league.
Universal Servic- Demanded.
Universal military service was pro­
claimed as the only real solution of
the American national defense prob­
lem tonight by Senator Chamberlain,
chairman of the senate military com­
mittee, in a speech before the Na­
tional Security league. Recognizing
that the people were not. ready for
such a step, however, the senator
said Secreary Garrison's continental
plan might be utilized to provide the
force which the country must have
to guarantee its security as a world
power, protect the Panama canal and
be ready to repel possible aggres­
sion from either Europe or Japan.
Administration Plan Might Be Used.
Senator Chamberlain's speech
came at the close of a day and night
crowded with plea after plea for tho
arming of the nation. Mayor John
Purroy Mitchell of New York, who
presided over the night session,
threw the league into a tumult of ap­
plause by demanding adequate pro­
tection for the country's metropolis.
Senator Phelan of California spoke of
the Pacific peril" and appealed for
preparedness to meet possible attack
from Japan. Senator Chamberlain
expressed the ppinion that military
universal service offered the best so­
lution for the problem, but the pro
gram outlinedby the -adnritrtstratibn
might be hammered into acceptable
form. v,'
Europe Hates Us.
"There is not a country in Europe
that feels kindly to us today and we
know it," he said "There is no use
for us to try to disguise it. 'So do
wot let any of us fool ourselves with
the idea that any of the powers of
Europe feel too kindly toward us to
wage an aggressive war on us after
the present war is over."
Be Ready Anyway.
"So much for the European side of
this. They say 'who wants to fight?'
•1 do not know who wants to fight,
but we want to be in such a position
that we do not care who wants to
fight."
Senator Phelan declared lie had
been realiably informed that the re­
cent presence of Japanese vessels in
Mexican Pacific waters was not to
aid a stranded warship of Japan, but
(or the purpose of making a demon­
stration of an American protest
against Japan's demands upon China.
"Japan is aggressive," Senator Phe­
lan said. "She seeks enlargement on
the Mexican coast."
Washington, Jan. 21.—Unqualified
support was given Secretary Garri­
son's continental plan before the sen­
ate military committee today by Ma­
jor 'General Scott and Major General
L'liss, respectively chief and assistant
chief of staff of the army. .Both am­
plified statements made on the same
schedule last week before the house
committee. General Scott declared
the plan would save at least live
months' time.of building up an army
of defense in an emergency. He ad­
vocated immediate organization of a
reserve corps of officers, actually com­
missioned and assigned to the posts
they would take in time of war.
Urged a Reserve Corps.
General -Scott also urged that a
quartermaster's reserve corps of en­
listed men be formed to include me­
chanics of all kinds, telegraphers,
radio operators, motor vehicle drivers
and experts, teamsters, railway men,
and the like.
Completing Trip Plans.
Final plans for 'President Wilson's
forthcoming trip through the middle
west on his talk npreparedness in-y
eludes stops at Pittsburg, Cleveland,
Chicago, Milwaukee, Kansas City and
Topeka. Tonight the president and
Mrs. Wilson left Washington on the
naval yacht, iMay flower, for a two
day cruise down the Potomas river
and Chesapeake bay, the president
having decided to seek seclusion for
the preparation of ah address he will
deliver January 27, in New York, be­
fore a banquet of the Railroad "Busi­
ness association, and to tentatively
outline the speeches he will make in
the middle west. He will keep in

less while away and plans to return

tNew Madrid, Mo., Jan. 21.—Tho ad­
visability of calling a mass meeting
to plan protective measures against a
possible attack by "night riders' on
'New Mjadrid was considered by the
citizens' committee tonight. Evi­
dence at the night rider trials today
indicated that many members of the
secret order are still at large. This
coupled with the threats of violence
contained in letters, signed "night
rider," which were received by Cir­
cuit Judge McCarty, Sheriff Karins
and four others here, yesterday, was
the cause of much uneasiness today.
Three more night riders were sen­
tenced today.

Ottowa, 111., Hundreds of families
have been driven from Jheir homes,
many bridges destroyed and a num­
ber of factories closed, as the result
of floods, which is sweeping through
the Illinois and Pox river valley.
One Life Lost.
Great damage has been done
around Ottawa and at La Salle, Mar­

Aurora, 111., Jan. 21.—The flood,
which caused great' damage through­
out the Pox and Illinois river valleys,
began receding late this afternoon,
according to reports here tonight. Be­
tween this city and Elgin the ice
packs, which had formed at a num­
ber of places and caused the waters
to overflow, were dynamited. This
reduced the danger of further dam­
age in the immediate vicinities.

Robber Secured $900.00 From
Famous Tourist Agescy
Office.
SHOT TRAFFIC MAN
THROUGH THE HEART
Taxi Driver Refused to Run Ma­
chine, So Took Flight
Through Alley.
Chicago, Jan. '21.—A bandit, accom­
panied by a woman this afternoon
robbed the tourist agency of Thomas
A. Cook & Son of $900, wounded the
cashier, killed a policeman, and es­
caped.
According to the police, the deed
was the most daring of years in this
city. It was accomplished on one of
the busiest streets of the downtown
district, at an hour when the thor­
oughfare was congested with automo­
biles ^ml workers on their way home.
Woman Sat in Taxi.
The woman did not participate in
the robbery. She ordered a taxicab
at the Great 'Northern hotel and John
McCabe responded. The woman in­
structed him to drive to the Cook of­
fices. There she waited without
alighting.
Meanwhile tho robber had entered
the offices. The cashier, Ernest L.
Walsh, attempted to reach a revolver,
but was shot and painfully injured
and backed into a vault with four
other employes.
Brewer A. 'Johnson, a trallic police­
man, was attracted to the scene, but
fouud the bandits had looked tho door
after entering.
Shot Thrugh Heart.
Johnson was trying to force an en
trance when the robber suddenly
threw it open and fired a bullet into
the officer's heart. The 'bandit then
scattered the throng on the sidewalk
and leaped toward the taxiqaj). He
pointed-ills--weapon at iMcCa.be and
ordered him to drive away, but 'Me
Cabe jumped from the machine. The
bandit hesitated a second and then
sped up an alley. The woman fol
lowed. She gazed for a moment at
the face of tho dead policeman and,
according to witnesses, seemed about
to faint, but recovered and disappear­
ed in the crowd.
McCabe was interviewed at police
headquarters and allowed to return to
work.
Woman Easily Escaped.
The easy escape of the woman, who
was young and well dressed, was ex­
plained by those who called at tlic
detective bureau, by the fact that'
they thought the robber had attempt­
ed to run off with a machine already
legitimately occupied.
But Wants the United States to
Grant Him Pledge of Im­
munity.
New York, Jan. —Federal secret
service agents received information
today which convinced them that Ig­
natius P. T. Lincoln, self-confessed
German spy, and former member of
the British, house of commons, was
aided in his escape from a Uniteu
States deputy marshal last Saturday,
by "Group B", a powerful organiza­
tion of European political refugees.
The government agents were satis
fled that Lincoln has never left New
York City.
Wrote Department.
Lincoln sent a letter today to the
head of the local bureau of investiga­
tion of the department of justice, of­
fering to surrender if he was promis­
ed immunity. This was taken to
mean that he wanted a pledge from
the United States government that
he would not be turned over to the
British authorities. Before his es­
cape, an order was issued for his ex­
tradition as a forger, but Lincoln has
always insisted that the English gov­
ernment intended to shoot' him as a
spy.
Made Up of European Exiles.
"Group B", the organization which
the federal agents believe arranged
Lincoln's escape, and is now hovering
him, is a body formed in this country
in 1872. It is said to include in its
membership several wel-known Euro­
pean political exiles.
GRANTED NINETY DAY

Washington, Jan. 21.—President
Wilson tonight granted a respite of
90 days to R. E. L. Maxey, sentenced
in the federal court at Pittsburg to
18 months in prison for using the
mails to defraud. Maxey failed to
permit his appeal hi time and it was
denied today. He claims that he is
innocent and a petition for his par­
don has -been filed at the department

El Paso, Texas, Jan. V, —Twenty
three persons were killed aear Pueb­
lo recently when a passenger train
was blown up, supposedly by Zapata
adherents, according to Tiumbo, a
wealthey mine owner of the state of
Oaxca, Mexico, who arrived here to­
day.
Only One Survived.
Only one passenger survived, it
was reported. The train, which was
blown up, Mr. Tiumbo said, was im­
mediately ahead of one 011 which lie
was traveling to Mexico City.
"Several volleys were tired into
our train," added Mr. Tiumbo, who,
with his wife, left' for Los Angeles to­
night. Willi them, when they arrived
was H. ('. Tanner of Mexico City, who
is convalescing from a bullet wound
inflicted, he said, by a military offi­
cer, when Tanner resented insulting
references to the United States.

Mr. Tiumbo reported typhus l'ever

Conditions as to liltli and destitu­

Villa Married Again.

proscribed Mexican chieftain, has
found time. be .parried ..and has
forsaken, his warhorse to ride iu, a
coach with his bride, according to
Ignacio Enriquez, civil governor of
the state of Chihuahua, who arrived
here today.
At least two women, one now in
Cuba and the other in Los Angeles,
are said to claim Villa as husband.
Will Force Intervention.
Enriquez confirmed previous re­
ports that Villa was boasting that he
would force intervention by United
States inside of thirty days, but de­
clared that Villa had only a lew men
with men.
Scout Jap Soldier Reports.
Government officials at Los Angeles
today said they place 110 credence in
the report from Calexico on the Mex­
ican border that several hundred arm­
ed Japanese had been seen in the
Sierra del Pinal mountains of Lower
California. They believe Mexican
workmen were mistaken for »lgpan
ese.
Death to All Americans.
Death to Americans in Mexico and
destruction of their property, as well
as war to a finish against Carranza.,
wits determined upon, it became
known tonight at a formal conven­
tion of Mexican revolutionary lead­
ers, near Cordova.
Present, and joining in the agree­
ment, iire said to have been repre­
sentatives of Villa, Zapata, Argume
do, Higinio, Aguilar, the Cedillo
brothers and many lesser chieftains.
Few Reports Available.
Meagre reports of this gathering
came to the state department long
ago, but they were not made public
and, until tonight, few people in
Washington knew that there was a
general conspiracy against America,
or that the rebel factions in the field
in Mexico had effected any kind of
agreement for concerted activities
against the de facto government.
The recent massacre at Santa
Ysable, attributed to bandits of Villa,
is believed to have been perpetrated
in concert with the order agreement.
Carranzists Not Informed.
Whether there is any probability
of coucerted action among the fight­
ing factions, the Carranza leaders do
not profess to know. Advices from
El Paso today to the state depart­
ment told of the reported capture
near Chihuahua of IS bandits alleged
to have taken part in the Santa.
Ysable murders, and said thev we1*"
to have been executed today. No
confirmation of the report that Villa,
himself had been taken was receiv­
ed and officials of both the depart­
ment and Mexican embassy abandon­
ed hope that this was true.
"SCALD BRANDING" TRICK
OF CATTLE RUSTLERS
Forf Yates, N. D., Jan. '2-1.—"Scald
branding," is the method used by
horse and cattle rustlers with such
success that stock thefts are greater
this winter than in years.
Cattle thieves cover an old brand
with a damp cloth, working over this
with a hot iron.
The steam from the cloth raises a
blister and that in turn raises the
hair making the new mark appear
like an old brand. A few weeks after­
wards, following the sale of the stol­
en cattle the new brand disapppears
and ^racing back to the thief is im­
possible.

ALL RESPONSIBILITY
For the Sinking of the Pacific
and Orient Steamship
Persia.
Vienna, Jan. 21.—The government
has informed Frederick C. Penheld,
the United States ambassador, that
no Austro Hungarian submarine was
concerned in'the sinking of the P. &
O. Line steamer, Persia.
Austria's Statement Believed.
Austria's statement that no Austri­
an submarine was concerned in the
sinking of the liner, Persia, probably
means that there will be no diplamat
ic controversy between the Teutonic
powers and the United States over
that tragedy, 111 which two Americans
were lost. Count von Bernstorff. the
German ambassador, has informed
the state department, that no German
submarine had reported attacking the
vessel.
Cause of Sinking a Mystery.
Officials of the state department
have made it plain that affidavits of
survivors of the Persia failed to prove
conclusively how the ship was de­
stroyed. She went down within five
minutes after a terrific explosion for­
ward, but no submarine was seen and
the only testimonv indicating an at­
tack was to the effect that the wake
of a torpedo was seen just before the

The Terms of Peace Offered by
Central Powers Were Too

MUNITIONS MATTERS
CAUSE ENGLAND WORRY
Germany's Campaign in Egypt
Has Met With Great
Obstacles.
London, Jan. 21.—The cessation 'by
reason of heavy casualties of the Rus­
sian attack against the Austro-Hun
garians near the Bessarabian frontier,
the capture by the Russians from the
Turks of the town of Sutanabad, "Per­
sia, and the taking from the Germans
by the British of additional towns in
the Kamerun district of Africa, are
the principal features of the fighting
as contained in the latest official com­
munication.
Montenegrins Still Fighting.
Although it has been reported that
the Austro-iHungarians and Montene­
grins are again at grips, no details
have yet come through as to the pro­
gress of the fighting. It is presumed,
however, that the Austrians will con­
tinue to press the Montenegrins to­
ward the Albanian frontier, and try
to capture Montenegro's principal sea­
port, Antivari.
Albanians Join Montenegrins.
A Rome dispatch says that Albani­
an, troops under ®sa Pasha, provision­
al president of Albania, have arrived
at Scutari, to join the Montenegrin
troops, who are retiring on that Al­
banian city.
French Buy Roumanian Grain.
In order to prevent the Central
powers from importing wheat fr»m
Roumania an Anglo-French corpora­
tion has been formed to buy all avail
ahle ygfliin .in/ that country.,
Broke Up Gerniah'Jlase.
Seizure by the French of the
Greek island of Corfu is now kno^yn
to have been due chiefly to the .loca­
tion there of an AustroGerman sub­
marine base. A second base haB been
located between Corfu and the Albani­
an coast. Most of the submarine
raids in the eastern Mediterrabean
have been directed from .these two
bases, by a fleet embracing German,
as well as Austrian craft.
Many Obstacles in German's Way.
Germany's campaign in Egypt is
meeting with unexpected obstacles, ti
is announced here, due to the lack of
coal to operate the railroad which
the Germans have- constructed south­
ward through Syria, to the edge of
the desert approaching the Suez ca­
nal.
Used French Material.
The construction of the railroad has
been largely facilitated by French
rails and material for a' similar line,
which was partly constructed, but. the
absence of coal prevents the actual
opening of the road to transporta­
tion.
This lack of coal has led the Ger­
mans to reopen the old Turkish mines
in Syria, used by the Romans, but
abandoned by them a thousand years
ago.
The capacity of these mines is lim
itod to 5'00,(KH) tons annually.
Submarine Sunk Vessels.
A dispatch to the Exchange Tele­
graph company from Rome says a
British suomarine has sunk in the
upper Adriatic an Austrian hydro­
plane and also an Austrian torpedo
boat which went to the rescue, tak­
ing the crew of both craft prisoners.
Anti-Alien Trade Law.
The house of commons today pass­
ed, on second reading, the bill amend­
ing the trading with the enemy act,
empowering the board of trade to pro­
hibit. any person, firm or company, of
hostile nationality or associations,
from carrying on business in this
country during the war.
Turks Were Dispersed.
An official statement from Petro
grad says that in the fighting with
the Turks the latter were dispersed
by the Russians and that the Turks
suffered losses of at least 1500.
Use Skilled and Unskilled.
The urgent necessity of speeding
up the munitions of war has deter­
mined the government to put into
force immediately plans for the dilu­
tion of skilled laborers with semi­
skilled, unskilled and women workers
in all controlled establishments.
In a statement' on the subject in
the house of commons today, Premier
Asquith announced that the govern-*
ment was convinced that this plan
offered the only prospect of securing
a sufficient supply of munitions to en*
able the war to be brought to a
speedy and successful conclusion.
Weinacht Jury Disagree.
The trial of Edward Weinacht, said^
to be an American citizen and whose^l
residence is 'Elizabeth, N. Jl, resulted^?
