SCHOOL BOARD IN SESSION
Various Matters Receive Attention of
Parish Directors.
Donaldsonville, La., Jan. 12, 1916.
The board of school directors of
the parish of Ascension met this day
with President W. B. Stuart in the
chair and the following members pres
ent: E. N. Pugh, George Bergeron,
Henry Dugas, F. E. Babin, J. F. Sax
on, Louis Bourgeois. Absent
Emile LeBoeuf.
The minutes of the last meeting
were read and approved.
The superintendent submitted the
following report:
Donaldsonville, La., Jan. 12, 1916.
To the Honorable President and Mem
bers of the School Board, Parish
of Ascension:
Since the last meeting of the board
I visited all of the schools of the par
ish with the exception of McElroy.
This school will receive my attention
within the next few days. Frequent
visits were paid those schools that
needs most of my attention. ^om
these visits I find that our rural
schools,while running as well as could
be expected, need close supervision
and attention. Our high schools are
doing good work and running smooth
ly.
In regard to our rural schools, I
find the sanitary conditions not very
satisfactory, especially in the out
houses. To remedy this condition I
ordered disinfectant for all the
schools throughout the parish. Be
sides, I ordered enough floor oil to oil
the floors at least twice during the
session.
The patrons of the Galvez school
have started work on their new school
building. I wish to say that the
school spirit manifested by the people
of that district is worthy of emula
tion.
Since the last meeting I ordered
the Barton school closed and had all
the children transferred by automo
bile bus to the Donalddsonville High
School. Miss Lawless, teacher of the
Barton school, was transferred to
Galvez to relieve the situation there.
I wish to report the following res
ignations which were handed in at
the close of the session: Miss Esther
Smith, Oak Grove High School; Miss
Ruby Castleberry, Oak Grove High
School; Miss Edith Morgan, Gonzales
High School; Miss Cecilia Dixon, Oak
Grove High School; H. P. Bullock,
McElroy; James Gray, Donaldson
ville High School.
The following appointments are
hereby submitted for your approval:
Miss Josephine Kuhlman, Gonzales
High School; B. B. Franques, Donald
sonville High School; Miss L. Opden
weyer, O4k Grove High $chool .
An agricultural fair was held at
Oak Grove High S3 t hdee4th i
rettion and supervision of the agri
culture teacher. While I was unable
to attend the fair due to illness, the
reports I heard'clearly show that the
fair was a success in every respect.
The school board, as per budget, con
tributed $125 as premiums for the
various exhibits.
The schools throughout the parish
were ordered closed for the holidays
Dec. 17, 1915, and were reopened
Jan. 10, 1916. Between these two
dates a one-week teachers' institute
was held in Donaldsonville High
School auditorium. I take pleasure
in saying that almost all of the teach
ers reported for the institute and
spent a pleasant and profitable week.
Respectfully submitted,
H. P. BROUSSARD, Supt.
The following resolution, offered by
Mr. Dugas, seconded by Mr. Berger
on, was adopted:
Be it resolved, that Mrs. W. M.
Babin be appointed a substitute teach
er in the Oak Grove High School un
til another teacher is available.
The following teachers were elect
ed to fill vacancies caused by resigna
tions: Miss Josephine Kuhlman, Gon
zales High School; Miss L. Opden
weyer, Oak Grove High School; B. B.
Franques,Donaldsonville High School.
On motion of Mr. Dugas, seconded
by Mr. Bergeron and adopted, it was
resolved that the bills incurred by
domestic science teachers of last ses
sion in the Dutchtown and Donald
sonville High Schools be patid.
The following bills were presented
to the board and were ordered paid:
Ramires-Jonels Printing Co.,..$113.55
Donaldsonville Chief .....45.85
Peoples' Machine Works . 1.50
Total ...... .... ... .......$215.65
It was moved by Mr. Babin, sec
onded by Mr. Bourgeois and carried,
that storm and tornado insurance be
carried on the following buildings:
Oak Grove, Gonzales and Dutchtown
High Schools, and that fire insurance
be carried on the Smoke Bend school.
The committee appointed to inves
tigate the Barton school made the fol
lowing report, which was accepted:
In view of the fact that the Bar
ton school is located at a very short
distance, on a gravel road, from the
Donaldsonville High School, and also
due to the fact that the building is of
a type totally unfit for school pur
poses, the committee, after careful
consideration, decided that by closing
the school and transferring the pu
pils to the Donaldsonville High
School, the interest of the pupils and
patrons would be best served. The
Barton teacher was transferred to
the Galvez school.
The following financial statement
was submitted for the quarter ending

LECTURE ON SOCIAL REFORM.
Peter Collins to Speak Here Feb. 6
Under Auspices K. of C.
"What's .Wroig. withm..he World"
will be the subject of a lecture under
the auspices of Ascension Council,
Khights of Columbus, to be deliver
ed at the K. of C. Hall in this city
,Sunday, Feb. 6, by Peter Collins of
Massachusetts. Mr. Collins is well
qualified to discuss in a broad, com
prehensive manner the great prob
lems of our day, and to set forth con
structive remedies that aid in the ad
vancement and progress of civiliza
tion. During the past five years alone
he has spoken to over 1,000,000 peo
ple in the United States and Canada,
and has traveled nearly 100,000 miles.
Peter Collins needs no introduc
tion to the men and women of Amer
ica interested in the great construct
ive movements of christian democ
racy and social reform. His expe
rience and activity in the cause of
social legislation well qualifies him
for his platform work, he having
served for many years as internation
al secretary of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,
editor of the Electrical Workers'
Magazine, and, as a member of the
Illinois Industrial Commission, one
of the first commissions in the United
States thate made possible a great
code of laws for the health, safety
and comfort of workers. This bode
has been copied by many states and
has received the approval of sociolo
gists and statesmen the world over.
Mr. Collins' work for the cause of
social reform and the advancement of
the interest and welfare of the work
ing man was specially blessed by His
Holiness Pope Pius the Tenth.
His efforts have always been for
constructive service, and his life has
been devoted to this work. He is a
consistent and untiring advocate of
the cause of the workers, and has la
bored for years in fighting the work
ers' greatest enemy-socialism.
He has delivered lectures and ad
dresses in many parts of the country
before schools, colleges and univer
sities, business men's associations,
chambers of commerce, labor organi
zations, woman's clubs, Knights of
Columbus councils, legislative com
mittees, and many other bodies and
" associations, and at Fordham Univer
sity, Notre Dame University, Oberlin
University, Universities of Kentucky,
Iowa, Georgia, Minnesota, etc. Pres
ident . Barker of the University of
Kentucky said: "Mr. Collins has a
wonderful message. It was one of
the ablest addresses I have ever
I heard."
The lecture will be free to all, and
a rare oratorical treat is promised
i those who attend.
New Haven Directors Acquitted.
The trial of eleven directors of the
New York, New Haven and Hartford
t railroad for alleged criminal viola
; tion of the Sherman anti-trust law,
culminated at New York on the 9th
inst. with a jury verdict of not guilty
as to six of the accused and disagree
ing as to the other five, the vote stand
ing eight to four for acquittal. The
trial has been pending nearly~ three
a months. Government counsel will
move for a new trial in the case of
6 the five directors, and there are six
2others who are to be tried separately.

QUESTIONS TO CANDIDATES.
Propounded by the Prison Reform
Association of Louisiana.
Following are the nine questions
asked of the candidates for governor,
lieutenant governor, attorney general
and members of the general assembly
by a legislative committee of the
Prison Reform Association of Louisi
ana, the committee's membership
comprising W. 0. Hart, chairman; F.
S. Weis, Andrew H. Wilson, J.
P. Thompson, E. M. Stafford, Mrs. C.
C. Devall, Robert H. Marr, F. S.
Shields, president, and John L. Sut
ton, secretary:
"Are you in favor of the abolition
of the present board of control of the
state penitentiary, and of the crea
tion of a board serving without pay
to have charge of the penitentiary
and to supervise parish jails and other
penal institutions, with authority in
said board to employ a competent
surintendentL suLy- :dat `rtlesf
and regulations for the government
of prisons and the inmates thereof?
"Are you in favor of an act of the
general assembly providing rules and
regulations for the government of the
penitentiary and other prisons, with
power in the board referred to in the
first question, if established, to add
to same from time to time if neces
sary and advisable?
"Are you in favor of a proper ap
propriation being made for the board
of charities and correction so that a
permanent secretary with proper
salary may be employed and provision
made for his traveling expenses and
for the expenses of the members of
the board who, of course, shall serve
without pay?
"Are you in favor of a new parole
law by which the parole board shall
be entirely independent of the board
of control of the state penitentiary
or of any new board that may be es
tablished for that purpose, and are
you in favor of parole officers so that
paroled prisoners may have some of
ficial to report to who will be able to
ascertain whether the conditions of
paroles are kept, and to report in
fractions thereof to the proper au
thorities?
"Are you in favor of the funds of
the state penitentiary being disbursed
in a business-like and systematic man
ner and with a budget system there
for, and for the widest publicity in
all the transactions connected there
with?
"Are you in favor of the indeter
minate sentence in this state and for
the adoption of a law providing for
same?
"Are you in favor of sufficient ap
propriations to make the reform
school at Monroe what in reality it
should be so that the inmates may be
taught trades and given an education
if necessary, and are you in favor of
establishing another reform school
south of Monroe, at Jackson, or some
other suitable place?
"Are you in favor of such legisla
tion as wil provide, in part at least,
for the support of families of prison
ers and provide a fund by which, up
on their release, prisoners may re
ceive some part of their earnings
while in confinement?
"Are you not opposed to corporal
punishment in the penitentiary and
other jails, and do you not recognize
that same is in violation of existing
laws, and are you not in favor of
making the offense of beating a
prisoner a separate offense from the
ordinary assault and battery, and of
providing some special method of.
proof thereof, so that such violations
of law may be properly and adequate
ly punished."
The Habit of Taking Cold.
With many people taking cold is a
habit, but fortunately one that is
easily broken. Take a cold sponge
bath every morning when you first get
ot-'of bed-not ice cold, but a tem
perature of about 90 degrees F. Al
so sleep with your window up. Do
this and you will seldom take cold.
When you do take cold take Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy and get rid of
it as quickly as possible. Obtainable
everywhere.- (Adv.)

PARKER'S PLATFORM PLANKS.
Summary of Things the Progressive
Candidate Stands For.
John M. Parker, Progressive can
didate for governor with the backing
of many independent Democrats who
place the best interests of Louisiana
above party, partisan or factional con
siderations, thus summarized at the
outset of his campaign the leading
planks of his platform and the things
which his candidacy represents:
"The Progressive party of Louis
iana is a white man's party.
"I am a Progressive and believe in:
Protection for our agriculturists and
workingmen against free trade with
those people whose morals, ideals
and manner of living are so different
from our standards-independent,
self-respecting Americans. Manhood
is our most valued asset and its pro
tection a national responsibility.
"Local option and strict enforce
ment of the law, because prohibition
does not prohibit, makes hypocrites
of many and brings the law into con
tempt.
"Our people should be permitted to
exercise the right of franchise with
out boss dictation, and all citizens,
from the highest to the lowest, with
out interference from -any source,
should vote for their individual pref
erence.
"Strict civil service in all cities, in
suring the places of those capably
filling office and making positions due
to ability and efficiency and not po
litical pull.
"An early constitutional ccoven
tion, composed of two delegates at
large from each congressional district
and nine at large from the state.
Such a convention will be much more
economical and -serviceable than a
larger one, and its work should be
submitted to the people for approv
al.
"Woman suffrage, because today
women are engaged in nearly every
industry as bread-winners, and their
active participation in public affairs
means better governmnnt. Give
them the ballot if they wish it.
"The short ballot, when the people
know for whom they are voting and
where responsibility is proportionate
with power.
"The abolition of useless offices
and sinecures and the appropriation
of money so saved for agricultural
and educational purposes only.
"A determined effort to see our
agriculturists and manufacturers
thrive, for they represent the true
wealth of the state, and their success
means good general business and
prosperity for commercial, banking,
professional and transportation lines.
"I shall straddle no fences and my
positiois oa ,n xa,> putlsie: ati Will
be promptly given.
"Practically unanimously the Pro
gressive party and many influential
Democrats have personally and by
letter urged me to run for governor.
"Everything I have is due to the
friendship and confidence of the peo
ple. I have never abused that friend
ship or betrayed that confidence.
"I never have wanted and do not
want public office, but if the people
of Louisiana feel my services will be
of value to the state I am at their
command, and if elected governor,
will strive to the limit of my ability
to give them a common sense busi
ness administration."

ney secretions were annoying during
the day and broke my rest at night.
Backache made it a dread for me to
stoop over or do anything that re

about Doan's Kidney Pills, I got'a

My kidneys are normal and that tired,

her position chiefly ornamental. "Wo
r men had to take the place of men and
. are now doing work which it had been
considered impossible for them to do,
and they are doing it very well. There
are few employments in which women
could not be trusted now to fulfill the
functions of male workers. * * * *
The world will never be the same
- again. * * * * Cherished ideals must
go and new situations arise, hence the
- importance of proper training for
girls."
I Yet the hunger strike of the Eng
lish suffragettes for the recognition
- of this self same principle, less than
two years ago, made some fools laugh,
and probably with their lack of im
- agination continue to do so.
Some People Call This Defeat. ec'
An analysis of the vote has been fly
made in the four eastern states whose on
suffrage amendments were defeated. by
Results show a total vote of 2,936,
715 on the amendment, with 1,234,- mii
470 favorable votes, leaving but 233,- of
888 voters to be converted. The iza
average for Pennsylvania, Massa- all
chusetts, New York and New Jersey m'
is 85 per cent of the needed vote, fo
with returns registering lowest for
Massachusetts at 70 per cent, while
Pennsyl-nia was within 931/4 - bt
cent of the required majority. In th
the whole state of New York an 8% fi
per cent gain and in Pennsylvania a fil
6% per cent gain will turn the tide.
m
New York has created a parole d4
commission with Katherine Bement m
Davis, the woman who has made such of
a wonderful record as commissioner
of the department of correction, as
chairman. Rumor, always anxious to
have a woman in authority discredit- al
ed, has tried to make it appear that p
the change has been made because of n
dissatisfaction with Miss Davis' ad- b
ministration. Says Mayor Mitchell rr
in this regard: - "If I had not thought fi
the parole board is of vital import- si
ance I would not have made the a
change. I persuaded her to become s
head of the new commission because t,
she would be free from the details of p
administration and because I wanted ti
the power of that position placed in
safe and sane hands."
Wouldn't Dolly Madison feel flat- i,
tered if she could know that her for- 8
mer home, the "Little White House" g
in Washington, is now the head- c
quarters of the suffragists? Mistress '
Madison was a dame far in advance
of her time, and just the sort of a
woman to approve the principles of
woman suffrage.
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy Most
Effectual.
"I have taken a great many bot
tles of Chamberlain's Cough Remedy
and every time it has cured me. I

Il taking it a cough always disappears,"
