of the Yuba leasing & Development

Jbssl to -the company will be heavy,
but; fortunately the . property was in
jured for about one-half of the ot

way toward, the rebuilding of the-
"plant; which President A. Y. Smith
informs the Record his company -will
probably undertake without delay.
However, the future plans of the com

until after the arrival on the,. 25th.
last, of , Mr. J. W. Furness. one of
the directors and largest stockholders
In the Yuba company. Mr. Furness Is
in California.
Speaking for himself. Mr... A. Y.
llnith said' he felt Bure that the
plaiit would be reconstructed. "Wei
J I've thei cre- ln the mine," he said
and1 I feel that the company should
..go; right on and rebuild and provide
facilities for the, handling of great
er 4onnage than "was possible' here
tofore.' Nevertheless, such experien
ces as this fire are mighty discourag-
. lag.
"We had decided." Mr. Smith went
on, "to install additional concentrat
ing tables. Callows screens and ether
equipment to .increase the capacity
ct .he plant at least 25 tons per day
l.uid were. !prepaving to cany thisi
work Into execution while the re
pairs in the.'Ni1. 3 mine shaft werel
" under way." ."
There appears " to be no question
; but wha the-destruction of the;
. Y'uiba mill was the work of an in
cendiary.: The. null had been closed
dawn since the accident at No. 3
shaft on the evening of the 2nd Inst,
mo fires were placed in the heatins
stoves and the plant was in care of
watchmen. '''
Angelo Bissio. was on watch at the
fire and had made the rounds of the
building only a few moments before
it wag discovered to be. in flames. Af
ter making the rounds, Bissio step
ped across tjie road to. the assay of-
tice to warm himself and it was
while he was there that the fire;
In the mill was kindled. Biteslo
first- noticed the flames bursting
Uji-oughi the elevator shaft of the
ore crusshing department .and, by
the time he had sounded the alarm
and reached the- building a?ain the
whale, interior of the upper unit ap
peared to be 'enveloped. Further evi
deno"J of Incendiarism was found in
the lowed unit of the plant which.'
contained the battery of cyanide
vats. Here, a fire gained good head
way, .under one of tie vats. bu'i
was extinguished without serious
damage having been done. Tht
work' was well planned and whoever
is reponsible for the dastardly deed
evidently kept close tab dn Wafcch-'inan-
Bissio and at the opportune!
moment stvfek the match' which
wrought destruction.
Considerable time was lost in getting-
the frozen valves and pipes in
toTworking. order so that lines of
"hose coului te trained onto -th'
"flames. Some could not be loosened
so holes were bored into the.tanKs
anrl rrtnrinct crt lin Wlt.n lines Ul
hose. Meanwhile the main mill
building went ti its doom; but .ef
forts were directed to saving the
'th-J spreadl. of., the five to the coal
chutes of the, Amalgamated Pioche
company beneath the approach to
tihw mill ore bins. The .fact . that
. this property was saved was due.

teered their services and formed a
. backet brigade. They fought like tro
' jans in; the wet and cold.;
An unsuccessful attempt was made
' several ' weeks ago to .destroy ; thd
' Yuba plant and the plot was flrus
' trated by one cf the mill employes.
The. Yuba company lias played in
' tough luck Biuce the beginning of
the year. The accident at the mine,
'tin wHcJi two1 lives, were lost, - and,
' now. the burning, of, the mill. The
' jmanagemeiit; has certainly the'sym
'.ipaithy cf all and the Record hopes
that the company will soon overcome
its temporary embarrassment ahd
that it will emerge with a . plant
: which will be bigger and' better, than
the one reduced to ashes.' The . plant
.' destroyed represented an 'investment
: it is said, of about 140.000,. .. i

IS IN THE RING
Jos. Hollinger was in from Eagle
Valley last Wednesday on -a busi-
nes8 trip. and. incidently. to let It be
known that he will be a candidate
for tihe Democratic nomination for
sheriff. Jce is a good fallow all
right, and should fortune come his
way and he should become sheriff,
we predict that he is big enough tq
hold the job down in- good shape
and. make a good official. But there
are some Democrats, and some Re
publicans too. after the same plum.
Of course they can't all .pluck 'it. , ,

Reports of the discovery of dog
apparently Infected with rabies, and
of one Infected coyote being found on

in Klamath county. The court has
amended its recent order for extra
bounty money by rating the extra
bounty to 5 per head. This order
is to be effective until March first
This sum together with the $1.50. al
ready being paid, makes a good
bounty. . ' , i i .
Besides this. Fort Klamath stock
men announce they will pay an ad- ,
ditional $5 (per head tor all coyotes1
killed west of the Williamson! river,
