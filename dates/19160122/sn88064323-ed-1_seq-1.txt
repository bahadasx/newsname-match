TRILBY AS REVIEWED
BY "WID GUNNING."
This is the Greatest, Combina
tion of artistic presentation, dra
matic strength, and effective at
mosphere ever shown in this
country as a film Frein these
view points, M. Tourneur has
given ns the greatest offering to
date "Tiilbv" |)laces that geni
al gentleman definitely as a su
preme master of the art of film
production. Beautiful Clara Kim
ball Young has given us a por
trayal which unfolds ne w depths
in even this most popular star.Her
''Trilby'' will never be forgotten.
She registered her emotions with
an artistic touch that carried
hidden strength. Her Big Scenes
were truly wondeiful. Mr. La
kaye's interpretation of "Sven
gali"has now been transferred
to the films. To the millions,
now be will always stand as "The
Svengali". Chester Barnett han
died "Little Billie" in a manner
that adds much to this young
man's laurels. There was a qui
et strength and appeal in his
work which registered strongly.
The film is a supreme l riumph for
the great director. He lias build
ed atmosphere that is perfect, he
has carried us from oi e land to
another with convincing effects,
his dramatic tempo registered
evenly throughout and builded to
the big climax witli perfect and
impressive contrasts. The hu
man touches inserted at just the
right moments, along with ex
quisitely lighted bits of'artistry,
are enough to carry the apprecia
tive members of an audience into
ecstasies. By àli means see
"Trilby". As presented at the
44th street theatre it naturally
bas the advantage of perfect mu
sic but this film will be a success
wherever shown Today M.
TOURNEUR is known in the
trade as a master and charming
gentleman. To morrow be will
be known to the millions as one
of the greatest producers of films
the world has known. "Trilby"
is the sort of production to make
even the unitiated ask, "who
made it?" Dont miss "Trilby"
and when yon see it remember to
pay a little mental tribute to one
M. Tourneur.

Mary once had lots of lamb,
With green peas and with pie;
Hubby had a steady job,
And put some money by.
Mary had a pretty gown,
Likewise a pretty hat;
There'was a piano, too.
In Mary's cosy flat.
Bull Moose fought the Elephant,
Free-Traders got on top;
Then the wheels where hubby worked
Came to sudden stop.
Mary, she had no more lamb ;
Her flat it had to go;
Hubby couldn't get a job,
There was no work, you know.
There is no further need to dwell
Upon their deep distress,
Fisrt good chance that hubby has,
He'll get square, you may guess.

WONDERFUL STORY OE
"THE GALLEY SLAVE"
BARTLEY CAMPBELL, tbe
celebrated author of tbe latest
William Fox success, Tbe Galley
Slave, in^ which the seductive
Theba Bara is staired, never
w^ote a more suoff^ssful or power
ful drama than this. Tbe follow
ing outline does not begin to do
justice to this wondeiful photo
drama.
A party of Americans arc "do
ing" the continent- At Venice
Sydney Norcott, an English ar
tist, has a studio and be meets
and loves Cicely Blaine, the
American heiress She loves him
and the two plight their troth.
The heiress is insanely jealous of
her lover and ir shocked because
he has a beautiful model, Fran
cesca, who has a little child and
who has been cruelly deserted by
her husband, AntoiDe Brabaut.
The Baron de Bois also loves the
heiress, proposes for her hand,
and is rejected. He retires from
the field to watch his opportn
nity.
The second act opens in a
scene iu a hotel in Rome. The
American party is there. The
heiress has interview with Nor
cottlheday before tbej ate to
get married and he tells her he
must make a call across tbe
marsh. Scarcely has he gone
when the Baron appears, again
presses his love and is rejected.
As he leaves, Francesca, the
model aud her child eDter. At
sight of the Baron, she clings to
him calling him her "husband,"
"the father of her child," etc. It
is true—he is Antoine, the poor
painter who bad married her but
when be fell heir to a title he de
serted her. On Francesca's
threatening to expose him, he
temporizes wit b her and agrees
to meet her "across tbe marsh
the next day.
He leaves. Cicely enters and
recognizes the model aDd her
child and demands tbe season
for her presence. Upon pledge
of secrecy Francesca poms out
the tale of her early love and
marriage and desertion and begs
Cicely to help her by not receiv
ing "him." The heiress, horror
stricken demands who "he" is
and is told "your lover." No
names are mentioned and poor
Francesca unaware of Norcott's
relations to Cicely imagines the
Baron is the accepted suitor.
Cicely of coarse thinks Norcott is
meant and she goes away at omce
without any explanation.
She revenges herself by marry
ing tbe Baron. After the mar
riage Norcott enters her room by
a window and upbraids her for
her perfidy. Still at cross par
poses they give each other back
the portrait they had exchanged.
By accident, tbe facts come oat.
Cicely learns that she has made a
dreadful mistake aad she swoons.
Tbe wedding gnests rush in and
find tbe bride in a private room
with a strange man who has her
portrait in a jewelled frame in his
band. The Baron orders his ar
rest as a common thief. To save
tbe honor of tbe woman be loves
Norcott yields to the terrible sitn
ation, is arrested, convicted and
sentenced to seven years's pen
ance at the galleys.
He is on tbe eve of being sent
to Tonlon. Francesca who has
been so poor tbat she was forced
to steal food for her child is also
to be sent to the galleys. Cicely
tries to rescue Norcott against
his will by confessing him to be
her lover bat he has to go any
way. The Baron who appears to
claim his wife, is confronted by
Francesca who denounces him
aud tells tbe whole story of their
early marriage.
The Baron says it is all a lie
and seems, as the husband of
Cicely, to have tbe right to claim
not only her fortnne bat her per
son. Through tbe ingennity of
the American friends, tbe earlier
marriage between tbe Baron and
Franoesca is definitely estab
lished. Brabant is forced to rec
ognize and support Franceses as
his wife Norcott is released
from bis dreadfnl seivitude and
is tree to marry the girl be loves.

On Tuesday evening last, ,o
the office of the Iberia Budding
was held the 29th annual meet ^
of the stockholdei s, fm the i r
pose of receiving and discus- .g
the reports of its officers cuve- g
the past yeat's busiuees, and 1 i

Mr. E F. Millard, the presid
called the meeting to older at
usual hour,-aud after the read
ot the minutes of the previous
uual meeting, he presented
annual ssatemeut of last ye,
business, aftei which he read
following addtess, prepan d
this meeting:
For sevei al years past, my

peculiarly uneven! f u'; hem e n.
report tonight will be entirely
voted to the consideration of t
affairs of our own Associât u
This jear, the seven h of our . ,
eration under the Dayton p! m
for the fitst time since its adnp
tion, shows a slight iticiea-e i
our assets over its predeces
Prior to the change of pVi !..
stockholders were warned, . I
the fact has been repeated y .
phasized, that theie would be i
shrinkage of the assets of the A -
sociation from year to year, u •
the entire liquidation of the <
serial part of the association.
This elimination of the seital
plan and the stock issued and
loans made theieunder having
been practically accomplish! d
we may hope for a gradual in
crease of assets, as well as a
slight increase in the earn g
power of the stock, provided t li at
the business conditions of cm
community and Paiisb justify an
Association larger iu size and the
demands of our peculiar class of
business call for more funds, au
ply secured.
Since its organization in 1887.
our methods have undergone
many changes, until we ha\e
evolved a plau must advantageous
to the borrower and equalled by
uo eight per cent loan in the Pai
ieb. On the other hand, pioper
ty conditions have likewise sus
taiued a metamorphosis as to va 1
ue. In the infancy of the Iberin
Building Association, our loam
were made on a rising property
market; today values are, in some
cases, stationary, and in others
declining, necessitating the nt
most conseivatism in making'
loaDS. Today each separate ap
plication for a loan is a distinct
problem, to be consideied on a
fair appraisal, the estimated mar
ket value of the property, its
rental vaine, the circumstances
of the would be borrower and
many other angles While your
Board has had uumerous applica
tions for loans, you will no*
that duriog 1915, we paid out foi
Dayton property loans $39,lfiti 5(
as against $60.993 15 during
1914; a decrease of $21,820 05,
or over one third. Yet tins is
not due to a lack of applicitiou
for loans, nor to a sen city ot
funds.
From the increase iu the
amount of Paid Up Stock, that
item appearing as $195,000 00,
the inference would be that more
of this stock had been issued last
year than during 1914 A com
parison of the statements of t li
sait! years will show that we ie
ceived from paid up stock in
1914, $71,200 00, as against $47,.
300 00 last year. The increase
is doe to comparatively am it
amount of this stock withdra wn,
its issuance having at times br-en
suspended, due to an accumula
tion of fonds for which then- was
no investment. Our people, f < m
the wage earner with one share of
paid ap stock to the capita'! ;
with a block of one hundred of
these shares, regard it a< abso
lately safe and in the nature of a
quick asset. That is, a reserve
apon which they can draw at a
moment's notice.
A study of the statement
shows an increase of the paid op
stock, in the Dayton stock, in tbej
Dayton loans and. in onr confie j
gem fond.
There Is remaining in force
only one hundred and ninety sev
en shares of the old Serial stock,
of which 114 shares are loaned on
and 83 shares are free. I he Se
rial stock account shows a bal
ance of 38,213 58; this will be
materially redoced by the liquida
tion of the 30 m&tnred shares in
Series 72 and 73, only four of
which are loand on.
