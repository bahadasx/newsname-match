FREIGHT EMBARGO RAISED ON
LIMITED CLASS OF MATERIALS
USED FORCONSTRUCTION WORK
- Modification of the freight embargo
recently ordered by the . New Tork,
New Haven & Hartford railroad, was
annotraced today to be effective at
12:01 a. " m. -Monday. 'The embargo
is lifted on building materials for
.buildings actually under contract and
partly constructed.
According to the afinouncement by
A. F. Currier, superintendent of car
service, the New Haven road will re
ceive at Harlem river only and handle
for- points . on the New Haven road
only, the following materials: Struc
tural and reinforolng steel .. and iron,
stone, lime, brick, cement, lumber,
terra cotta, tile and wall plaster.
The raising of the embargo will per

page of these materials., , - '
Individual manufacturers : in '. this
city are greatly peeved over what has
been termed ""reflection" uporfHhe in
dustrial interests of t Bridgeport in the
matter of removing cargoes from New
Haven railroad cars In this vicinity.'
It' is the knowledge of many manu
facturers in this city that the f actor'
ies with their corps of truckmen and
trucking agencies have kept their ma
terial free from the freight houses and
cars pn sidings, 'which cars after f re
quent admonitions ; by : the railroad
company have . been known to have
remained on sidings., as . many aa six
days after 'notice- of clearance had
been given by the factories to the rail
road. " - i ; . '
It is stated by reliable manufactur
ers today that if any delays in unload
ing have been obstructive to the rail
road movement of cars it was due to
contracting and building interests
rather than to the factories who take
the comment of railroad officials
deeply -to heart. .',-
This soreness of spirit Js greatly ac
centuated by -the' fact that embargoes
on western Shipments- have- taurfsed
them great' loss of business through
the non-delivery of raw material with
which to operate and the additional
fact that In order to even keep their
wheels turning they have been com
pelled in .many instances to surrepti
tiously enter the New York trucking
field, in order , to . get goods here ; by

STARTED
boat lines as well as the railroad com
panies in relation to certain .ship
ments from the west, the boat com
panies have no means of identifying
goods taken from Jersey City trucked
across the- Hudson river ferries, and
Manhattan Island to the local boat.
Therefore this method ! has been
adopted by Bridgeport manufacturers
at great expense to themselves and in
some instances big loss of profits.
In commenting upon local freight
conditions, particularly relating to
statements made by freight officials
here yesterday one well known truck
man said:
"It is not a fact that truckmen are
unable to get nough trucks or men
to move the freight. A glance at the
Water street freight house On Thurs
day would convince any reasonable
minded man that' goods were not com
ing in here for there .was little freight
on the floor and consequently we have
been compelled to sit back in our
chairs and wait for it to be delivered
at Bridgeport. I will venture tile
statement that on Thursday, last at
the Water street " freight .house, less
than 15 incoming cars Were - delivered
during the morning hours. This state
ment, however, does not apply to the
boat dock.
"That the situation between the boat
officials and the railroad officials Is asr
tense as between local manufacturers
and the railroad is evidenced by a fact
that no railroad man - can deny. It
was only last week When the freight
heads- of. the two lines met .in the
yarda, , and discussed the , holding of
the boat for railroad freight. With
the New Tork officials of the railroad
company present, local steamboat men
were ordered to send their boats away
frpro Bridgeport on schedule without
awaiting arrival of delayed cars; -
"An incident which may throw light
on. tha, situation and the manner of
freight handling' here is the consign
ment of -several bags of beans for a
grocery - house of this city which ar
rived in Bridgeport the latter part of
November. ; These were not uncovered
from a mass of congested freight until
January 18. When delivery was made
it was discovered that no bills of lad
ing were available. Later it was dis
covered that-these had been In the
hands of the clerks in the local freight
office.' "--'-.- .; i t ,

to be cdnsidered.
It is said here that the appointment
of Judge Wheeler is supported by Ho
