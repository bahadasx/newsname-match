Frldny morning about 11 o'clock,
Chief of Police .lames Mnckey nnd
Deputy Sheriff Mike llrown placed
llnrry Hcnnker, prominent poultry and
stock denier of Cyuthlnna, under ar
rest on the chargo of Inning assisted
In nn arson rase.
It will bo remembered Hint during
tho first week of December Hint tho
Inrge poultry pens belonging to Hcn
nker located nt Lewisburg In tills
county, were burned to tho ground.
As Hie lire occurred nt night nnd as
tli cro had been no fire about tho place
for several days, the state lire mar
shal was summoned to the scene.
Former Fire Chief Edward Hlte of
this city, then deputy tire marshal, wns
given the task of unraveling the mys
tery that surrounded the burning of
tho buildlnns.
Evidence of tho use of coal oil and
other Inllammablo material wns found
and upon further Investigation It wns
Icnmcd that within the Inst, llvo years
seven dwellings owned by Hcnaker had
been destroyed by lire.
Tills knowledge caused tho Insur-
mice companies to become more nlert
and after surcral days of thorough in
vestigation it was lenrned that Eneas
Williams, colored, of Cynthiana, who
has worked for the Hcuakcr Company,
had on December 1 bought several
gallons of coal oil nt different stores
In Cyntlilnna, and alter gathering it
Into one shipment, had It expressed to
Lewisburg us personal property; also,
It was lenrucd that he hnd purchased
n pair of new oicrshocs.
Ity some expert delect he work the
negro, It wns learned, hnd come to
Lewisburg on the dny of the fire and
hnd been seen about tho destroyed
buildings and it was also learned that
ho had asked a farmer living near tbnt
place for a mntcli, which was gncn
him.
Tho footprints about the burned
building corresponded with tho shoes
worn by Williams, who, In his confes
slou, says Hint ho was employed by
Barry Itennker for the sum of $250 to
set fire to the building, at Lewisburg,
Itennker snylng that tho reason he
wished them destroyed wns Hint they
were a losing proposition and that he
did not want to Journey from home to
attend to tho business there.
Of tho $250 promised, Hcnnker Is
said to have given him $20 as tho first
payment, promising to pay him when
tho deed was accomplished.
Williams, went to Lewisburg and
went to tho building and poured five
gallons of coal oil on somo kindling
and coal lying In tho place; then he
touched a match to tho Inflammable
pile and left, locking tho door. Ho
came to this city, throwing his shoes
away, as Itennker Imd Instructed him.
As It wns at a late hour that the
building was destroyed, tho tinio of
tho arrival of the negro In this city
was close to tho time that tho first
C. & 0. train leaves for Cincinnati In
the morning.
Before boarding the train Williams,
destroyed tho overcoat Hint ho wore,
throwing It Into the rlier. lie then
went to Cincinnati whore he stayed
severnl dnys, taking tho L. & N. buck
to his home, where ho wns at the time
of his arrest by Fire Marshal G. T.
Helm and Officer Gcorgo Dickey.
I'pon his arrest he was brought to
this city and after being put through
the "(bird degree," ho made a full con
fesslon to Chief STackcy and other of
flclals. Heuaker was implicated by
Williams, It is snld, in tho confession.
Kenliilng that tho cvldeuco of the
negro would not convict Itennker,
Chief Jrnckcy aud C. 3s O. Special Of.
fleer Thomas Stewart derided to trap
him aud get nil possible evidence

Thursday night Detective Stewart,
dressed In n suit of overalls, n cordu
roy shirt' and with a red bandana
handkerchief about his neck aud his
fnce bfgrlmtued with dirt, wns placed
lu the cell next to Williams, who was
told that Stewart was a dope craied
hobo. Ily lying on the stone floor

On Thursday afternoon thn Senior
history clasBes of the High School had
tho pleasure and honor of listening to
a very Instructive, Interesting nnd en
tertaining lccmro on "Robert H. Lee,"
given by Itov. H. L. Bonn.
Itov. Mr. Bonn presented a most
vivid Idea of the southern caiwo which
Is not often heard nowadayx.
By his splendid and eloquent nc-
count of tho llfo and character of Lr-o
he fully convinced those present who
had not already learned to love the
great Confederate leader, and brought
those who had to n state of adoration.
The Seniors nil agree that Rev. Mr.
Bonn possesses an unusual amount of
magnetism, and deem themselves for
tunnto to hnvc heard such an accom
plished speaker.
