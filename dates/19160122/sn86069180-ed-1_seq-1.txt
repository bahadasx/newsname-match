ENGLAND ALWAYS OUR ENEMY
Ex-Gov. Samuel W. Pennypacker,
of Pennsylvania, In an article in the
Philadelphia Public Ledger this
week presents an able argument as
to the conduct of America In the
present European war and dis
cusses the probable effect from both
the standpoint ot victory of the
Allies and Oeiman success. Mr.
Pennypacker's argument and logic
Is unanswerable and it Is significant
that the pro-English press have re
frained from publishing it or lefer
rlng to it In any manner. In part
he says:
Americans who aie not hyphen
ated by being either Anglo-Ameil-cans
or German-Americans ought
seriously to seek the correct solu
tion of two fundamental queries,
and to decide what result will for
the future most benefit mankind,
and what course of conduct will
most benefit their own country.
Should the Allies win It would
mean that Russia would come west
in Europe. England has already
promised her the possession of Con
stantinople as a means of reaching
the Mediterranean. How Is that
result going to bo helpful either to
Europe or to the world? Russia
already occupies the half ot Europe
and the halt of Asia with more ter
ritory than she can utilize and with
more people than she can provide
for properly or civilize. Does the
posslblo substitution ot the Slav and
Cossack for the German piomlae
improvement or retrogression? In
truth, looking at the matter broadly
and with a view to the welfare of
humanity In the management of
mundane affairs, there ought to be
a union of all branches of the
Teutonic race, Germany, Holland,
Rntrinnd. the United States. Sweden,
onr--3Tssiitin4f1--toft)e-'ftij
vancement or the interests tnoy imv
in common and for the protection
against the inroads, first of the Slav,
and then of the Mongol. The Eng
lish are only a tribe of Germans,
who In the sixth century found their
way across the North Sea to their
island homo. Their supreme sin In
this war has been that they have
proven faithless to their race and
have cohabited with tho heathen
and the stranger in order to gain
help In a household quarrel.
Spencer and Darwin long ago
pointed out that the struggle for ex
istence Is most fierce between those
species which are closely allied in
blood. Britain is hostile to us be
cause she knows that wo both want
the samo things. She showed that
hostility when she burned our Capi
tol, when she sent out tho Alabama
and Florida to prey on our com
merce, when she with Russia drove
Bhustor out of Persia, and when
she prevailed with Mr. Wilson and
Elihu Root to surrender our sov
ereignty over the Panama canal. In
this war by maintaining a real nou
trallty and indicating a proper
sympathy with a sturdy and capable
people, struggling for existence
against seemingly overwhelming
numbers of British, Fiench, Serb
ians, Belgians, Italians, Russians,
Algerians, Japanese and Hindoos,
we might have made a friend
among the nations. It would seem
that tho very meanness of giving
support to such a combination
would have been resented by Ameri
can manhood. Instead it may as
well be recognized that we have
bo managed as to retain tho old
rivalries or Great uritniu, anu to
make another enemy of Germany.
Professing to fear the German mili
tary spirit, we have done all that
it has been possible to do to bring
her wrath upon our heads. We
have been boisterous In our con
demnation of Germany. Wo have
hidden out ot sight and condoned
the far moio grievous offenses of
Great Britain. In all of our 'his
tory Germany has never crossed our
path. Wo have never made a step
forward that the British havo not
endeavored to thwart. Let no man
rail to observe that in those matters
affecting ourselves where we have
given blamo to Germany in this war
her efforts were being directed
against her enemies nnd the injury
to us was incidental, but that on
the other hand tho injuries inflicted
by the British have been directed
against us. The British havo closed
Iho North Sea to our commerce.
They havo used our flag to cover
their belligerent efforts and thus
given an appearance of justification
for assaults upon boats sailing un
der our colors. They have block
aded our ports, seized our vessels
and confiscated the cargoes. Gen.
Grant informed France that we
would regard the hovering of
belligerent vnen-of-war around our
ports as an "unfriendly act," but
we have forgotten American tradi
tions and have become like the
quack doctor in the old French play,
who said, "the heart used to be on
the left sldei but all that we have
changed." They and their Allies
have dared to overhaul our boats
in the high seas and carry away
men found on them. We fought the
war of 1812 to prevent such aggres
sion, and Rome of us well remember
the attitude of the British when
1 1 Wilkes seized the rebel emissaries,
Mason and Slldell. on a British
boat, transporting them on their er-
rand of destruction to American
nationality. Confronted with such
facts we havo shown the teeth of a
tiger toward Germany In her time
of stress, and cooed our objections
to tho British with our blandest
notes. We have supplied the British
with the means of conducting their
warfare. Wo havo been silly enough
o lend them the money to pay for
the munitions they buy from us.
Our press in connection with such
events as the sinking of tho Lusi
tania, and tho execution of the
treacherous nurse, has not hesitated
to use the ugly word "murder" In
senseless fashion. Mr. Wilson noti
fied the Americans who had been
Invited to Mexico and had there in
vested their substance and taken
their families to leave tho country.
He had no word for those Ameri
cans who heedlessly went on board
the Lusltania, and being on the ves
sel of a belligerent, loaded with
munitions ot war, lost their lives.
It would have been a warning given
before and not after the event, and
might have saved them from the
results of their indiscretion, but
he failed in his duty.
If the Biitish win this war thoy
will tighten their hold on the seas,
where they even now threaten New.
York and our whole coast. The
Cossack will be in Constantinople
and perhaps In Berlin, and the Jap
anese, their ally, who they have
agreed must be satisfied before
peace is made, will "be" crossing the
Pacific, -avhat-good will alMhis do
to America, even though Schwab,
flu Pont and Morgan aro more
weuimy i
. If the Germans win, then in all
probability Canada, with the Great
Lakes, the St. Lawrence river and
tho Manitoba wheat fields, which
the British wrenched from us In tho
Democratic days of Polk, will enter
the union of the States. Canada
will be unable to protect herself in
any other way and can do no other
wise. What Charles Carroll tried
to accomplish during the Revolution
and would havo succeeded In doing
had it not been for the Canadian
dislike of the Puritans of New Eng
land will havo been realized and tho
hopo of Washington and the pa
triots who founded the Government
be fulfilled. When that time comes,
and it may come, the United States
of America will occupy a continent
and its representative institutions
dominate the destinies ot mankind.
Its system of government with this
demonstration of the Inefficiency of
royalty which has become an an
chronUm, will soon bo adopted by
Great Britain. And we shall owe
our disenthrallment upon the seas
and our relief from a danger which
has often tlueatened us In tho
North, not to our own foresight and
endeavors, but to those of Germany.
HAVE HARD TISIE.
Division' ,t: -cm: H,.rieron
Thursday night of last week with
only a small attendance, due largely
to illness of members and other
reasons. This division has had a
hard year, paying out all Its income
for sick and death benefits. In view
ot the depleted treasury it was
voted to notify all members to bo
present at the meeting next Thurs
day night, when action must bo
taken and the future policy of tho
division decided upon. This state of
affairs Is said to be largely due to
the non-attendance of members.
President Mark Ryan has invited
County President Connelly to be
present, and he will install the offi
cers. IJERTHAND CLUB ELECTS.
At a meeting of the Bertrand Ath
letic Club Monday evening the fol

It is tho purpose of the club to

gin enrolling school youths, and with
early athletic training have the
nucleus or a splendid athletic or-1
ganlzatlon.
AMALGAMATED.
At tho December meeting Branch
5, C. K. of A., of St. Boniface par
ish, voted to consolidate with Branch
6, of St. Martin's, and the union took
place at tho first new year meeting
of the latter. There was an attend
ance that well filled St. Martin's
Hall, and tho proceedings were
marked by enthusiasm and the best
of feeling. President Oscar Maler
welcomed tho members of Branch 5,
hearty responses being made by a
number of Its old leaders, who wero
rejoiced that the two branches wero
one. Treasurer Falk and Secretary
Hoffman endorsed tho action, which
greatly increases the membership of
Branch C, for years the largest in
this section of the country. The busi
ness was followed by a social hour,
when congratulations wore ex
changed and refreshments and a
collation were enjoyed.

WELFARE
Associated Activity For the Ad
vancement of the General
Good.
Duty For the Catholic Members
of the State and Com
munity. Noteworthy Action Taken by
Toronto Catholics Watched
With Interest.
POLITICS MUST BE AVOIDED
The public welfaie Is cortalnly
the concern of all. Particularly is
there a duty for the Catholic mom-
beffr l.sSt&ieox-c9Smusityi9-l
turn their attention to the problems
with which that State or community
has to deal. They can contribute
much toward the solution of these
problems because of the stability
which ordinarily characterizes the
Catholic population. In tho midst
of the Dressing necessities of pres
ent day social conditions this is all
the moio Important, l'lus a., m
fact, in his encyclical on "Christian
Social Action" points in an especial
manner to tills obligation on tho
part of Catholics to participate in
fho discussion of public affairs. "It
Is certain," he says, "that the pres
ent constitution of States offers to
all wtihout distinction the power of
Influencing public opinion, nnd
Catholics, while recognizing the ob
ligations Imposed by the law of God
and tho precepts of the church, may
with safe conscience enjoy this lib
erty and prove themselves capable
as much as and even more than
others of co-operating In tho ma
terial and civil well-being of the
people, thus acquiring that author
ity and respect which may make it
possible for them to defend and
promote a higher good, namely that
ot the soul."
A very interesting effort along
this line of action has been recently
launched in tho city of Toronto by
the Catholics of that municipality.
"The Catholic Municipal Association
of Toronto" has been formed. Its
objects, as set forth in Its constitu
tion, are "to promote and encourage
the study of civic administration In
the system of government and In
the administration of civic affairs;
to procure wise and progressive leg
islation and to do all that Is pos
sible to insure a strong civic gov
ernment composed of representa
tives pledged to efficiency, consist
ent with economy, and to promote,
discuss and support measures relat
ing to the welfare of tho city and
the citizens."
Branches are to be organized in
all the wards of the city and to
keep in close touch with all tho
Catholic voters In their vicinity.
Municipal measures aro to bo care
fully studied and an especial effort
is to bo made to develop public
speakers within tho association, "so
as to fit members to meet their fel
low citizens on equal footing in
public life." "All questions, meas
ures and grievances," It is also in
teresting to note, "shall be dis
cussed with tho idea in vlow of tho
betterment of all classes and creeds
that go to make up tho population
of the city, and matters taken up
shall be dealt with in the spirit of
broad Catholic charity, without
heat, and all personalities and all
unfounded statements shall be elim
inated." (
TJhls work ot the Catholic citizens
of Toronto will be watched with a
great deal of interest. Properly
conducted, on the sound basis of
true Catholic principles, it should
be productive of gieat good for that
municipality. Partisan politics must
of course bo scrupulously avoided.
In our own country such activities
have been carried on in a more or
less systematic way by the district
leagues which the German Catholic
nocietles have organized ia various
communities and by local CatfPblic
federations. Legislation affecting
Che welfare of the city has been
carefully studied, and that which
has been Of value has been in-
v fi- ii
.. .?
dorsed and that which haB been,
detrimental has been opposed. Such
work deserves to bo extended. In
this way will tho Catholics fulfill
their duty to their1 community and
also to tho church which is theirs.

apd steam heating systems and the
making of the buildings sanitary in
every respect. President Meehan
called special attention to the aid
rendered by Col. P. H. Callahan,
Owen Sullivan and E. J. O'Brien,
whose efforts were largely re
sponsible for much of the good
work noted. He also commended
Jeff Bannon for his assistance and
Drs. Henry Rapp and Joseph
Schaefer for their services to the
Sisters and orphans. The farm was
well managed and supplied both in
stitutions with vegetables for the
summer as well as storing away
much for the winter. The health
