CHARGES
Deny They Have Violated
Law in Issuance of Free
Transportation.
SOME HOT SHOT FOR LUKE
t'Jiargtj That His Own Friends
Have UsedJlany Free
Passes.
Nashville, Tenn., Jari. 19. Deny
ing that it has issued free passes for
the purpose of corruption or bribery,
or that it has violated either laws of
the United States or of 'the Stato of
Tennessee in the issuance of such
free transportation, and charging
that the petition of Senator Luke Lea
was "not filed with a view of sub
serving the public good, but from
mnlicious ' and improper motives,"
tho answer of the'N. O. &St. L. Rail
way has just been filed with the In
terstate Commerce Commission in
Washington by the attorneys of the
road. At the same time the answer
of the L. & N. railroad was filed with
the commission.
The petition filed with the com
mission Some time ago by Senator
Lea attacked the legality of the issu
ance of passes in Tennessee by the
L. & N. and the N. C. & St. L. Rail
way, and charged that such issuance
of passes was for the purpose of cor
ruption and bribery, and also that it
was directed against the L. & N. and
N. C. & St. L. roads operating in
Tennessee which nrc'nnd have been
issuing intrastate passes, and that if
Senator Lea is sincere in his petition
he should not have mentioned only
two roads and omitted the others.
The answer of the roads also refers
to the recent Senatorial primary 1 and
the attempt of the petitioner(to make
a railroad issue in that campaign; of
his utter failure to make such an is
sue, and of his repudiation by the
polls. In referring to repeated at
tacks made through the columns of
the Senator's paper directed against
the L. & N. and N. & C. roads, the
answer characterizes then as "false
statements intended to arouse the
prejudice of the pepple against re
spondent and in favor of petitioner."
The answer also reproduces let
ters showing that from December
1910 to January 1, 1914, the paper
owned and published by Senator
Lea "requested" free transportation
and such transportation was furnished
to the the Tennessean and American
just as it was to other newspapers
over the state, daily and weekly.
One letter which is a request for a
book of fifty trip passes bears date of
Dec. 9, 1913, thirty days after Sena
tor Lea's resolution was passed in
the U. S. Senate. These letters are
given, the answer says, to show that
in the issuance of free passes all pa
pers were treated alike notwithstand
ing their editorial attitude, and that
certainly no effort was made to "cor
rupt" the paper of petitioner or to
influence it in any way.
The answer admits the issuance of
free passes to farmers and educators,
to preachers and to representatives
of various charitable institutions. It
maintains that through the co-opcra-tlon
with the Department of Agricul
ture, Department of Education, etc.,
that much good has been accom
plished to the state by enabling the
farmers to gather in institute meet
ings and by making possible the
gathering of the public school teachers
in educational meetings. The answer
also says it 1ms given passes to news
papers, particularly the country press,
"to encourage such newspaper enter
prise. It lias believed tliat prosper
ous newspapers of this character are
of great advantago to tho develop
ment of such communities, and it has
been willing to aid those engaged in
such enterprises by a moderate
amount of free transportation."
The answer also rofors to the fact
that for twenty years the rallrontis
lmvo given free tiausportations'to the
governors and other public utliciuls of
the state, who request it and that it
remained for Senator Lea to chargo

Sales on tho loose floor tobacco
market this Week were again disap
pointing as to the amount of receipts.
But little more than 300,000 pounds
were sold and the sales arc still far
behind the corresponding period last
year. The bright side is that the
weekly average in prices still shows
an upward tendency and is 70 cents
higher than the average for the seas
on. It is true the weather had not been
favorable? until the Inst few days and
and the dirt roads are in bad condi
tion. The j)olicy of dragging the
dirt roads seems to have been aban
doned by the farmers in many locali
ties and as a result roads that were
good last year are now very bad.

that they were corrupted by such free
transportation.
The answer denies that free passes
have been issued to prominent inter
state shippers in order to influonce
their slupmontsyund also denies that
the issuance of intm-statc transporta
tion has become a burden upon intcr
stat'e commerce as charged by Sena
tor Lea in his petition.
The answer also says that respond
ent is advised that the issuance of
intra-state passes is something over
which the Interstate Commerce has
no control; that it is a matter wholly
without its jurisdiction, and that the
state railroad commission knows and
has known the practices ot the vari
ous railroads in the state, and further
more that the section referred to by
Senator Lea as covering the issuance
of passes in Te'nnessee, is not inter
preted by either the interstate Com
merce Commission dr the state rail
road commission the same as petition
er Lea interprets it and tliat section
of the law is quoted in the answer,
showing that where the petitioner
seeks relief, that part of the law is
not used as in the Act to Regulate
Commerce; in other words, tliat
where the Hepburn Act speaks about
property, persons, etc, tho Tennes
see law omits "persons."
Tho answer also says that the giv
ing of insses by public service cor
porations is different from giving of
patronage by politicians, for in the
former case the mid givoa something
that belongs to it, while in the case of
the pohtu'i tn he may, on occasion,
give something win -h belongs to the
people ot tho state or the United
States.

Fox Brothers Increase The
Price of Cream For Their
Plant.
An important announcement is made
in the Kentuckian's advertising col
umn by Fox Brothers Co. On and
after Jan. 24th they will increase the
price paid for butterfat to 40 cents

want to arrive at the maximum num
bor of cows that can be secured for
this plant, The o'ffer they are now
making is to guide them in certain
'contemplated changes. Instead of
semi-monthly iwyments, they will also
: inaugurate weekly paymonts and in

patrons. -

PAUPER
BILL DEFEATED
Drastic Anti-Pass Measure May
Suffer Like Fate in
Senate. STANLEY NOT BACKED' UP
Senators Say Some of Drastic-
Features of Bill Must Be,
Eliminated
Frankfort, Ky., Jan. 21. The-
crushing defeat in the senate Thurs
day of the Trigg pauper idiot' bill and
the unmistakable evidences- tharthe
anti-pass bill may suffer a like fate,
unless some of its more drastic featr
ures arc eliminated, were the absorb
ing topics of gossip.
It seems assured that the adminis
tration will not be able to pass the
anti-pass bill, unleis it consent to an
amendment for the exemption of
newspapers from iiie operation nf the
measure. Upponents of the-MR in Its
present form regard their victory as-
already won.
Friends of Gov. Stanley have been
bringing pressure to bear upon him
to persuade him to surrender to the
clamor of the rural newspapers; the
editors of which are veiy much ex
cited, it appears. The whole commo
tion has placed the governor appar
ently in a very embarrassing posi
tion. If he surrenders his (wHtfcal
enemies will declare that he did so
through the fear of the power of the
country press on his political future.
If he stands to his guns, the outlook
is that he will suffer a defeat when
the measure is acted upon.
NEWSPAPER PEOPLE PROTEST.
James B. Stears, editor of the Nich
olasviire News, and president of the
Kentucky Press Association, and G.
B. Senff, editor of the ML Sterling
Advocate, and chairman of the asso
ciation legislative committee, arc in
Frankfort to protest against tho pass
age of the Stricklett-Pickett anti-pass
bill, which they say is bitterly oppos
ed by the newspaper publishers of
the state as an unwarranted interfer
ence with railroad rights. President
Stears said he was receiving protests
from editors by wire and mail from
every section of the state against the
passage of the bill.
The Trigg bill, which was defoated
in the senate by a vote of 22 to 8, pro
vided that counties must pay lialf of
the annual per capita allowance for
pauper idiots. The state now pays
the whole allowance $75 icr capita
and the bill would reduce the ap
propriation one-half. This ineasure
was generally regarded as ono of the
administration's economy bills.
Senator Frost's bill for the submis
sion of a constitutional 'amendment,
"forever prohibiting the manufacture
and sale of intoxicants," . will lie re

say they would prefer not to proas the
