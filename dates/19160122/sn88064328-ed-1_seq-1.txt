HERE'S A WAY TO SAVE
DOCTOR BILLS.
Physicians Give Free Advice by
Which Parents May Pfofit.
It was an association of gen
tlemen, professionally physicurns
and chemists, all of whom were
•horn in the drug trade, so to
speak, and who hjiVj^bcen connect
ed with it all their lives, who first
gave to the world Castoria. which
as every one knows is a pleasant
and effective remedy for the ail
mcnts of infants and children. It
has always been recognized as a
meritorious preparation, and its
yward has heen the greatest pop
■ t 1...
ûlarity ever enjoyed by anv rem
©d v ever put upon the market ; at
tained, not by flambohmt avertis
ing or appeals to ignorance or vul-'
gar prejudice, l>rt by inherent
merit. All physicians recoin
mend it, and many, very many,
prescribe it.
Many parents call in the fam -j
ily physician. Many other par
cnts take advantage of what the
physician told them when he was
first called in consultation. All
pood family physicians
"Give the children Castoria.
Healthy parents know this rem
edv of old, for they took it them
selves as children. It was more
than thirty years ago that Cas
toria made a place for itself in the
household. It bore the signature
of Charles II. Fletcher then, as it
does to day. The signature is its
guarantee, which is accepted in
thousands of homes where there
are children.
Much is printed nowaways
ahout 'big families. Dr. William
J. McCrann, of Omaha, ..eb„ is
the father of one of these much
read-about families. Here is what!
Now is the good time to
take your little ones out,
tln»y need that refreshnig
and wholesome air, and to
make it convenient for you
we have Go-carts and Push
carts tit for the Child of a
King." ' ,
Our line is a complete
one, prices range from 1
$1.50 to $40.00 -
Remember we. pay the
freight on all purchases to
to all pcrints.

he
says :
I "As the father of thirteen chil
■dren I certainly know something
ahout your great medicine, and
: aside from my own family exper
! ience I have, in my years of prac
tiee found Castoria a popular and
efficient remedy in almost every
home."
Charles IT. Fleeher has received
hundreds of letters J5p»rh promi
nent physicians who have the
same esteem for Castoria that Dr.
McCrann has. Not only do these
physicians say they use Castoria
in their own families hut they
prescribe it for their patients.
First of all it is a vegetable prep
aration which assimilates the food
• Mn.rt-111 « 4- .. 4-1, Ä .... î
and reculâtes the stomach and
bowels. After eating comes sleep
ing. and Castoria looks out
and Castoria looks out for
that too. It allays feverishness
and prevents loss of sleep, and this
absolutely without the use of
opium, morphine or other bane
Kul narcotic.
-j Medical Journals are reluctant
to discuss proprietary medicines.
Hall's Journal of Health, how
over, says "Our dutv is to

to end. To our knowledge Cas
toria is a remedy which produces
compo su re and health by régulât-!
in«* the system, not 'by stupefying
it, and our readers are entitled to
the information."
In every home, where ther are
children there should be a bottle
of WHITE S CREAM VERMI
FUGE. It idestroys worms and
acts as a tonic in the debilitated
system. Price 25c per ho tie.

is usually attrihnted to the int'u
ence of a mother. When nun
! talk of days past, no word brings
forth more treasured memories
I than "mother."' When a lawyer
; wishes to arouse a jury's compas
sion for a client, he invariably
speaks f the effects of conviction
j on the mother. Poets, dramatists,
i and fiction writers of all aires have
been united in honoring her name.
Days have been set aside in her
honor, pensic ; are given her,
flowers named for her, societies
founded for her. All this is well,
The world world be a sorry
world indeed, if it were not so.
I5ut is there not danger of father
being overlooked in the shuffle,
The average father succeeds pret
ty well in discharging his duty to
society, lie labors along per
sistently ami quietly for six days
a week that his family may he pro

family and the world, shouldering
the responsibility of the rent, the
tAxes, tile Li'ocery and the coal
hills: lie admonishes the boys and
advises the mother, seeking al
ways to make their burden light

complaint, lighting scheming, suf

may be assured comfort and

NO DANGER OF IiWASIO.-i.

Here is an article from ii. F.
l 'et t igrevv, forme r I 'nit ed Si,i tes
I Senator lrom South Dakota, who
hows t lie inside ol i lie ^ame at

I pretest against the .idminis-,
.'ration's plan for increasing the.
iirmy and nav'v in order o pr.
pare this country for war. 1 lie-'
lieve there is less danger of
vasion than ever before in
history of the I'nitcd States.
When the present war is over.
Eirope will have no ships ith
which to invade the I'nitcd Stales
and no money to equip an expédi
tion. It would take the victorious
nation a ye. to get ready. Why
then should the attention ef our
people h», turned to the prepara
tion for war, which must result
ultimately in war?
I also believe that if we pre
pare. Canada and the rest of
North and South America must
prepare for war and thus turn
this Continent into an a run
camp which has for forty years
cursed Europe and her laboring
population vvitii enormous taxes
and resulted in the present univer
sal conflict. I
I believe that interested parties
are back of this agitation for
preparation for war. men v. h >,
speculate out of the necessities of
governments engaged in armed
conflicts and ^ ho never do any
lighting or join the army them
selves. No war can be a just
war, but a war of defense to repel
invasion.
j
1 believe that the best prepara
tion for war will be to do econom
ic justice -by our own population
—by furnishing every man a
chance to earn a living, protect
ing him from exploitation by the
cunning and the strong and see
ing that lie lias the entire product
ofi his toil, and thus infuse our

would be impossible.
I am certain no European na
tion or Asiatic nation, for that
matter, will undertake to invade
the United States. It. would take
a thousand ships to transport one
million men to the shores of the
United States from any country.
These ships would cost more than
two billions of dollars, to say

nothing of the equipment < r

have to bring with them And if!
they should succeed in evading

and
without ever being able to leave
the shore where they landed. If
they landed in Mexico or Canada,
the result would be the same we
would meet them on our border
line.
all the history of the world,
no great army with its equipment
has ever heen transported across
the sea and successfully invaded
an v country. For a thousand
years England has been free from
invasion because of the 20 miles
of water which separate lier from
the continent of Europe. Spain,
the the' height of her power and
greatness, equipped the Armada
to invade England and she entered
the English Channel with a vast
force of mnrq'than ten ships to
'one' nf tTie force of En-cTand could
bring against her: and yet no
landing was made on the English
Coa»rt; hrt her immense ships—
twice as large as those eommand
hi-Howard and Drake—went
to0he. bottom, aud the Armada,
after sailing around England and
Scotland, was wrecked in a storm
on the Const «f Ireland.
A1»out Ihe middle of the Tl.ir
teenth Century, the Tartars, un 1er
thè leadership of Cubla Kahn, in
vaded and conquered all China.
He then assembled his army for
the conquest of Japan and. with
300.000 men. crossed the Chinese

HAVEYOU WEAK LUNGS?
Do colds settle on your chest or in your
bronchial tubes? Do coughs hang on, or
are yon subject to throat troubles?
Such troubles should have immediate
treatment with the strengthening powers

!
of Scott 's Emulsion to guard against
consumption which so easily follows.
Scott's Emulsion contains pure cod liver
oil which peculiarly strengthens the res
piratory tract and improves the quality of
the blood; the glycerine in it soothes and
heals the tender membranes of the throat.
Scott's is prescribed by the best special
