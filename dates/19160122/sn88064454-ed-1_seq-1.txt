The Opelousas girls basket hall
team defeated the St. Martinville
team on last Saturday by the over.
whelming score of 99 to 22. The
local girls virtually played "ring
around roses" with the visitors and
treated them shamefully in the
way of scores.
After the game the visitors were
treated royally by the )pewlousas
girls, a (lance being given in the
dinning hall of the LaChombe Ho
tel, which was very much enjoyed
by the fair damsels from St. Mar

GOOD ROADS.
Many of our people are serious
ly realizing the abs 'lute necessity
of good roads and many from this
town are agitating the question of
voting a special tax to buil( gravel
roads leading to St. Martinville.
The result of the voting of this
road tax and having roads that will
be permanent, will all depend up
on the result of the election Tues
.day, for the Police Jurors for the
first ward.
If Goulas and LeBlane are elec
ted, we have not the least doubt
that the people will vote the tax.
if Smtede is elected the tax will be
defeated, wecause he is not a road
advocate. some of the roads under
his care and control have never
been worked in the four years of
his administration, which is the
assurance that we have nothing
more to expect of him in the fu
ture than lie has done in the past.
We all neced and want good roads,
we feel that we must have them,
but the first thing to do is to put
in )power officers we can expect
will do the will of the people, and
not those we know have refused to
give the people what they have
been asking for during the past
four years.
Defeat Smede and you can hope
the people will vote a special tax
for good roads, elect hint and you
destroy your chances of having
good roads for four more years.
We will never advocate building
good roads that will lead to mud
holes, this would be folly.
Voters of the first ward, the mat
ter of good roads rest with you.
CATARRH CANNOT BE CURED
with LOCAL APPLICATIONS. as they
cannot reach the seat of the disease. Ca
tarrh is a blood or constitutional dis
ease. and in order to cure it you must
take internal remedies. Hall's Catarrh
Cure is taken internally, and acts direct
IV upon the blood and mucous surfaces.
Hell's Catarrb Cure is not a quack medi
cine. It was prescribed by one of the
best physicians in this country for years
ard is a regular prescription. It is com
posed of the best tonics knowu. comblu
ed with the best blood purifiers, acting
directly on the mucous surfaces. The
perfect combination of the two iugre
dients is what produces such wonderful
results in curiung catarrh.

Plant Shade Trees.
Now is the proper time to set
Iut shade trees People usually
hmake the mistake of waiting until
Into in the spring before they think
ibout planting shade trees. It is
rather risky business then. as the
root system has no time to Icolne
established. If the spring and
early sumlllllltmer haplens to be dry,
is often is the case, the trees will
lie unless thety are regular!y wa
ered. Plant a tree in December
ur January and see that the earth
is well packed about it and it is
thIe rarest thing in the world for it
,ot to fltiourish. - Abbeville Meri
