StaU a wearer of the.stripea '
Mr. Johnson said that until recent?
ly the public had heon unaware of
the large number of criminals that
are given to the world through the
marriage of feeble-minded people. It.
la known, he said, that at least two
people out of every 1,000 persons in
the United States are feeble-minded
and that approximately 80 per cent,
of the criminale are feeble-minded.
He said that investigation had shown
that one-half the boys in the State
reformatory at Florence are children
mentally deficient. < Feeble-mm ded
ness, he said, is largely an inherited
trait.
"There are three classes, the idiots,
the imbeciles and the morons, de
jClared the speaker, who was aided in
his classification by stereopttcon
slides. "None of them are strong
enough to he virtuous and out of this
tact grows the army of the feeble*
minded."
The lecturer made it plain that the
enforcement of celibacy among the
leeble-mlnded and alcoholica was the
sole measure for preventing this
Urge and irresponsible class from In?
creasing. Mr. Johnson said that it
was the duty of the State to care for
stich persons, for economic If not
for humanitarian reasons, and to see
that they neither begot nor bore
children. "They are antl-soclal and
are children in mind, heart and re?
sponsibility," declared Mr. Johnson.
Should a State or county embark
on an enterprise to take care of the
feeble-minded, Mr. Johnson advised
that buildings, of modest outside ap?
pearance be erected lor housing
purposes. He pointed out the need?
less expenditure by a number of
States In constructing large and ex?
pensive buildings for the insans and
ths feeble-minded.
I Mr. Johnson showed many pic?
tures of ths different clauses of fee?
ble-minded persons. Including idiots,
whose mental age is that of a child
under three years of age; imbeciles
or mental children between three
and seven years; and morons, or
persons whose mental development is
that of a child between seven and 12
years of age. Tests for determining
the classification of a feeble-minded
person were explained briefly.

AUDITING BY CONDUCTORS.
Atlantic Coast line Railroad Adopts
. . New System. !
Charleston, Jan. 20.i~A system of
auditing by the conductors of the At?
lantic Coast Line Railroad's passeng?
er trains has been inaugurated by the
management of the railroad company.
A stair of auditors, It Is stated, have
been appointed on the various divis?
ions of the railroad system, and these
are required to check up the conduc?
tors of the trains as they board the
trains at any time or place.
The system Is different from that
adopted by the Southern Railway a
few years ago, when collectors wore
placed on the passenger trains and did
all of the collecting from the pas?
sengers and left only the responsibility
of running the train to the conductors.
It Is stated that the Atlantic Coast
Line's system of auditing only requires
the conductors to have their reports
made up to the minute, or to be In a
position to tell as soon as an auditor
boards a train how many passengers,
tickets, passes and fares he has.
The system was adopted Monday.

Of exchanges among diplomatic rep*

jthe programme contemplates a vir?

Urine and delay in putting the plans

The subject has been approached

Application of the . blockade of neu?

the United States established a prece?
dent in the War Between the Sections

Tragedy Serres to Emf^baav mporU

tory lor Tests. ?. < . ,
Washington, Jan. 17.?A ex of
inquiry was named by Secretar, n
iele today to investigate, deu ..as
the cause and fix the responsibility for.
the explosion aboard the submarine
E-2, in the New York navy yard
Saturday, which caused the dentil of
four men and the serious injury oC
ten others. A navy yard board ap*>
pointed by Rear Admiral Usher im?
mediately after the accident reported
to the department tonight that the
investigation would be continued, but
It was still too early to decide its out*)
come.
The court of Inquiry will be com*
posed of the following officers, all of
whom have had wide experience la
the various phases of submarine work:
Capt. William II. O. Bollard, Lieut,
Com. H. G. Sparrow, Lieut. Clyde 8,
McDowell and Lieut. Joseph O.
Fisher.
Members of the court left Washing*
ton tonight for New York and will
begin the inquiry tomorrow.
A report is expected before the end
of the week.
The tragedy served to emphasise
the need of a laboratory equipped to
test batteries, engines, etc., of naval
vessels. The submarine E-2 has been
used for testing the new Edison sub*
marine storage battery because the
navy had no other equipment suitable
for such purposes.
Mr. Daniels said today he had asked
congress for an initial appropriation
of $1,000.000 for the erection of a
laboratory and hoped that it would
be authorised this year. He eil?
hereafter experimental work would ha
conducted as far aa possible in the
navy s laboratories and net aboard,
vessels.
The condition of the civilian wora>
men injured aboard the E-2 wag im?
ported as favorable. Three IlllsjA
men. Chief Electrician Milse, Magnja
a serious condition, r atthotsUl thW
' showed slight improvement.
Electrician Raymond Otto waa the
only enlisted man among ths victims
of the accident whose injuries were
not considered dangerous.
THIEVES OPEN OBSTINATE SAFE?
Ycggmen Score Artistic Success beg
Fail to Profit Financially Fro**.
Their Efforts.
Greenlvlle, Jan. 17.?Two instance*
of safeblowing occurred in Greenville
early this morning. The amount of
money stolen was not great, as one of
the safes was empty and the other
contained only $50 which the yegg
men secured. The Mutual 8upply
company of Woodslde Mill lost $60
to the robbers when Its safe wag
blown open.
L. C. Hart's store at the Intersec?
tion of Buncombe and Rutherford
streets was broken into and the safe
blown. It happened, however, that
this safe was an old one, having been
purchased with a stock of goods be?
longing to Hart's predecessor. The
present owners lost the combination
and have never been able to open
the safe.
The officers are so far at a loss to
fasten the crimes on any specific per*
sons. It is believed that the men
made their get-away In autoa On*
man was arrested today at Poe mills
on suspicion. He gives his name as
James McKay.
The yeggmen went about theif
work as if they were experienced at
the business. Nitroglycerine and
soap were used. Entrance to the
safes was effected In both instances.
Both exploslors came between the"
hours of 2 and 4 a. m.
