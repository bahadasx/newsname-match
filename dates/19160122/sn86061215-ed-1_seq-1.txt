SENTIMENT SOON
TO DEMAND ARMY
New Yorker Says People of
Nation Are Changing
in Their Attitude
Washington, D. C., Jan. 21. At
tacks on the administration's foreign
policies pointed references to "the
utter state of unpreparedness of the
quate defense, featured addresses by
prominent speakers today before the
National Security league.
Arraignment of the foreign policies
of the administration was made by
Henry A. Wise Wood, chairman of the
conference committee on national de
fense, New York.
"It may be said, with accuracy that
we have no foreign policy at the mo
ment," he said. "With the destruction
of our citizens, while on foreign
merchantships or upon our own men
chantships, we offer no armed interfer
ence, nor do we offer armed interfer
ence when our citizens while on for
eign soil are destroyed, their wives and
children outraged, their property con
fiscated.
Sentiment Changing.
"Furthermore, it is to be doubted
whether at the moment we are willing
to enforce by armed intervention such
of our domestic policies as are Inimical
to the interests of foreign nations.
Therefore, to discuss a naval policy
for the United States, at this time,
would seem a mere academic occupa
tion were it not for certain indications
that we are about to experience a na
tion wide reaction of public opinion
whijph cannot fail jt° crystallize Into, a
national gpirit, finding expression in a
definite code) of policies dealing with
foreign affairs in order to sustain
which the United States, if need be,
will declare war."
In pointing out that "other nations
fight in packs and we singly," Mr.
Wood said: "The United States should
formulate a naval policy that would
bear the full brunt, if necessary of a
coalition of powers." He advocated a
naval policy that "would maintain at
all times in the Atlantic a'force super
ior to that of Germany in the Pacific
a force superior to Japan protect the
Panama canal against capture or de
struction by land or by sea, or injury
by air."
Cooperation'Needed.
"The present machinery of our gov
ernment Is utterly unfitted to deal
with our major naval problems," de
clared Charles Q. Curtis of New York,
a prominent manufacturer of ship tur
bines. "Congress should follow the
advice of the general board and adopt
Its program without delay. The co
operation of the shipbuilders should be
enlisted and both private 'and govern
ment yards should be put in condition
to build all the warships necessary
with the greatest possible rapidity."
George von L. Meyer, former secre
tary of the navy, declared, "The funda
mental defect of the navy department
is that it has no brain, no competent
military organization charged with the
preparation of the fleets for war, and
in consequence the navy Is being built
and administered on a peace basis and
Is not being efficiently prepared for
war service."
He urged the fortification of the Pan
ama canal and the additional protec
tion of it by the navy, a definite naval
building program, abolition of useless
navy yards, necessary Increase of per
sonnel with the increase of tonnage,
establishment of a national council of
defense, prompt organization of a
naval reserve of over1 25,000 men and
creation of a navy general staff.
(Marine Held Necessary.
P. H. W. Ross, president of the Na
tional Marine league, advocated "an
American merchant marine owned by
Americans, manned by Americans, and
at the beck and call of our govern
ment. He said that it would solve
more than half of our defense prob
lem, "just as Lord Inchcape has shown
that Britain's merchant marine has not
only a second line of defense, but ao«
tually an integral part of her first line
of naval defense."
PROBE MILK RATES.

Variety of Goods Valued at

Looking for Kindttnfr
While hunting
tor
Thursday evening, Herman Kight, son
of Ed Kight, livlnc north of town,
discovered about 1800 of merchandise,
believed to have been stolen recently
from the C. B. ft Q. railroad company,
dumped in a ditch on North Elm street
near the old field. The lad with his
father and Frank MoCullough, who
was with them at the time of the dis
covery, brought the goods to the
police station this morning. Chief
of Police Gallagher got in touch with
the railroad officials but they reported
that they had learned of no loss. The
goods were being shipped to firms in
Omaha. There were two boxes of
gloves, a box of shoes, pneumatic door
springs, rubber stamps and ink pads
in the lot found by the boy.
Young Kight was enroute home with
hiB father and Mr. McCullough and
noticing the box in the ditch, started
to get it for kindling. The box was
frozen In the ice and nearby were
several other large boxes, each one
broken open and the contents scat
tered about. Mr. McCullough tele
phoned the station and Chief Gallagher
told him to bring the goods to the
station.
Mr. McCuulough ,told Chief Galla
gher that his mother-in-law, who has
been ill, was sitting up about three
weeks ago Sunday night, and that she
heard a wagon go past the house about
3 o'clock in the morning. The goods
were evidently left in the ditch before
the cold weather as the boxes and con
tents were frozen in the ice and it was
necessary to chop them out.
The gloves were being shipped to
the Gate City Glove Co., Omaha the
stamps were for George C. Smith, gen-^
eral purchasing agent of the Union
Pacific railroad at Omaha, and one
box that was unopened was addressed
to James Martin & Son, Omaha.

LIFE TERM PRISONER Rft&CNTS
REFUSAL OF STATE TO A*.
•UMB MENTAL BULL.
Des Motnes, Jan. tl.—Failure of
the authorities to provide for the re
pair of some of the prisoners' teeth
Is said to have caused the disturbance
among the convicts at the Anamosa
reformatory two weeks ago, which
culminated In an attack upon Warden
McClaugbry by a guard rendered in
sane daring the trouble, according to
Information received by members of
the state board of control here today.
The board will start an Investigation,
it was announoed.
It was said that six months or more
ago Convict O'Toole, No. 2967, who Is
a life prisoner and has been In the
reformatory more than twenty years
for murder, asked the authorities to
provide him with a set of teeth, and
his request was refused because the
state had made no provision for sucIl,
cases. Myroti Clark and John Milleiv
also serving life sentences, were said
to have been refused similar requests.
O'Toole, in his application for den
tal work, it was reported, infomed
the authorities that he had fourteen
"snags" in his mouth 'and $16.98 in
the prison bank. He claimed to be
suffering from mouth disease and had
a bad stomach because of his Inabil
ity to masticate his food properly. A
new set of upper and lower teeth
would have cost $25, but the authori
ties refused to allow a bill for more
than $9, and O'Toole refused to part
with his savings. The latter took the
position that he had spent twenty
years of his life in prison, and, as /the
state had received the benefit of /his
labor during that time it was the duty
of the state to take care of his teeth.
During the last year it was reported
further, Clark asked for dental work,
saying that he did not hive one good
tooth and thus he was compelled to
swallow prison fare without masticat
ing It.
O'Toole, Clark and Miller were re
ported to have been ring leaders in
the recent disturbance at the prison,
starting the agitation because of their
failure to get new teeth.
The state board of control had not
fixed a definite date for beginning the
investigation today, but it was expect
ed that the inquiry would begin
within the next week or so.
W. J. Dixon, chairman of the bonrd,
In replying to the application of Pris
oner Clark for relief recently wrote to
him:
"We have only a small fund for
your entire institution. We can only
attend to simple fillings and extrac
tions and can only spend one or two
dollars on each man. Your work was
too much for our funds to stand."

FROM JAIL.
Albany, Ga., Jan. 21.—Five colored
men were taken from the Worth coun
ty jail at Sylvester last night and
were hanged to one limb of a tree on
the outskirts of Starkville some time
during the night. The bodies, con
taining many bullet holes, were found
this morning.
Forty or fifty men took the flve pris
oners from the Jail and sped away
in automobiles. They were being held
in connection with the killing of Sher
iff Moreland of Lee county, duriqg
the Christmas holidays.
Cutting all wires leading north from
Sylvester was included in the plans
of the party. Officers were foiled in
their attempt to telephone to head off
the lynchers.
The flve men were hanged to one
limb within full, view from the road.
Apparently they had been strung up
and then became targets for the men
who had taken them from jail.
Four of the victims were of one
family—Felix Lake and his three
sons, Frank, Dewey and Major. The
fifth was Radius Seamore.
Moreland was killed at the home of
Felix Lake when he went there to
