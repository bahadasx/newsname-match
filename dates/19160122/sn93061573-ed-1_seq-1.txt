SUSPECTED AUTO THIEVES
HQ BY CLAYTON COPS
Woman Member of Tarty Walked to
Texliue After Dark to Avoid
Arrest.
V. K. Smith and Mr. Smith, J. II.
Burnett and Patrick Stevens were
arrested by local officers Saturday
night upon information from Den
ver police stating that the three Ford
cars the suspects had in their poss
ession were stolen from Denver. De
tectives W. A. Ilinker and J. A. Schu
macher arrived in Clayton Tuesday
and took charge of the quartet. It
is thought by Denver police that they
have operated extensively in the
auto stealing business between Den
ver and Dallas.
Stolen Spark Coil Gives Them Away
The quartet and cars drifted into
Clayton Saturday afternoon and left
the Mrs at the Clayton Garage and
Auto " Company. The people took
rooms at the Commercial hotclv A
parage man at Des Moines wired
Clayton ollicers to watch for three
Fords as a driver r one had stolen
a spark coil from him. The coil was
found in the car Burnett was driv
ing. Burnett was arrested and taken
before Justice Kingdom. There was
not sufficient evidence to convict
him and he was released. Chas. Mon
roe of the Clayton Garage got a
hunch that the Ford trio, was not
according to Hoyle and had "Spec"
Chilton fret data from, the sheriirs
office of recent car robberies. The
data, of course, gave the license and
engine numbers. Monroe ami Chil
ton compared these and found the
engine number to be that of a stolen
Denver cao. The remaining two
ears -were evidently recent accou
trements, as the Union county sher
itT had not yet been untitled of their
theft.
Mrs. Smith Walks to Texliue
Olllcer Crumley wired the other
numbers to Denver police and re
ceived reply to cause the arrest of
the four. It. seems that Mrs. Smith's
intuition, or something, convinced
her that there were breakers ahead.
When ollicers arrested Smith, Hur
nett and Stevens Mrs. Smith was not
to be found. At that time it was
dark and although a diligent search
was made she was not located. Sun
day, a call from Texliue told officers
that she was there. Mrs. Smith hao
walked the entire ' distance from
Clayton to Texliue, arriving there
about I a. in. It is said that Mrs.
Smith was a v ictim of circumstances
and not altogether u willing accom
plice of her husband. She is said
to have shown signs of a recent
"beating up" at the Minds of some
body. lieside the three Fords the quartet
sported two bleary-eyed blanket
clad dogs, a large assortment of dia
monds and a trunk fu:l of auto li
cense tags.
A reward of 100 came to Clayton
.officers with $50 more coming up if
the suspects are convicted.
A. L. Wikoff took charge of the
Fords and shipped them to Denver.

Mrs. Jas. Greer, .H, died at her
liome nine miles south of Clayton

DISTRICT COURT MAY DECIDE LI
CENSE ISSUE
Application of Albert Butler to
County Clerk, Juan J. Duran for
license to conduct a retail liquor
business in Clayton was rejected
Thursday by Mr. Duran. -As grounds
for not granting the license Mr. Du- j
ran has the opinion, or rather the.
absence of opinion of the District
attorney ulio would not advise, ac-
cording to Mr. Durun's statement, '
whether to issue the license or not
to issue it. Inasmuch as the Hoard I
of County Commissioners had issued
prior licenses and .-is Mr. Duran was
not legally advised as to whether'
his act would have legal sanction or
not he played safe. j
Throuiih his attorneys, Toombs A. ,
Harris, Mr. Uutlcr has made applica
tion for writ of mandamus which if
granted will bring the mutter before
the district court and according to
our information this being the llrst
case of its kind in the state, may
settle a series of controversies oier
the entire state which are said to
have come from the same cause
that county clerks can legally issue
liquor dealers' licenses.
The mandamus application had .
not been granted Saturday at noon. !
District Judge Lieb is lir Mineral
Wells, Texas, and it is necessary to
go before Judge David Leahy, of
Las Vegas, for sanction of the appli
cation. Olllcer Holds Suspect

315 CARS SHIPPED FROM
CLAYTON
From the figures of Travel
ing Freight Agent Sam Smith
we learn that freight ship
ments from Clayton during the
last year total the flattering
sum of 315 cars. This means
cariota, consisting mostly of
grains broom-corn and live
stork. On account of the ad
vantage in rales Texline gets
about half of the legitimate
out-going shipments. Elimin
ating this condition, Clayton
1915 shipments, placed conserv
atively reach tiOO cars.
Agricultural Commissioner
Lamson for lie Burlington
lines visited Clayton Saturday
on an inspection trip and vol
unteered the statement that
his coming was at the personal
direction of J. J. Hill, presi
dent of the lines. Mr. Lamson
said that this would indicate
the company spending some
money for advertising in behalf
of Union county.
SLATS" MAKES DEAL FOR
FAMOUS TRIANGLE MOVIES
Rankin will secure "Damaged Goods"
If Patrons will Stand for the
Price.
Seats have arrived for the Dixie
theatre and are being Installed. The
shippers, it seems, just tossed the
seats into the freight car promiscu
ously and some of tliem were dam
aged which caused some delay in
getting them placed in the auditori
um. Manager "Slats" ilankin made a
special trip to Denver last week and
closed a deal for the exclusive use
of the famous "Triangle" photoplays
in Clayton. These pictures are made
under the direction of three of the
world's most, famous producers and
the Triangle product is acknowledg
ed the highest type of the silent
drama. Itaymond liilchcock, Rob
ert Mantell,, Dorothy and Lillian
Gish, Win. S. Hart and dozens of
other . bright lights of the movie
world are hilled for Clayton at the
Dixie each Friday night.
Manager Ilankin is contemplating
getting the nine reel feature, "Dam
aged G Is." This picture has taken
every city by storm on account of
its vigorous "punch" along moral
lines. Press reports say it is most
sensational but the motive so plain
that the most fastidious are not dis
posed to censor it. "Slats" says the
picture will cost him a cool $100 for
a single night and wants to gel ex
pression of his patrons relative to
their standing the price it will cost
per head. to make the picture a
break even proposition. "Slats" has
been giving his patrons pictures that
our haughty sister cities in every
direction have not been able to boast
and we hope Kankiu will be able to
make the "riffle" with "Damaged
Goods."
Skating Party for the Kids
Upon the completion of Robt. W.
Isaacs' brick implement sales-room
"Uncle Hobby" will give an after
noon skating party for the kids. The

has been stocked with implements a
reception will bo given for tho older
folks with cigars for Hie men and
an appropriate present ror each lady
who attends.

business. Mr. Herzstein left Satur
day for Philadelphia, Boston, New
York, to buy spring stock of his
ready-to-weur store.
UNION COUNTY'S FINEST
BUILDING IS COMPLETED
Roye Construction Company Give
the Mission Building Into Mr.
Ilcrzstein'a Keeping.
The Hone Construction Company
turned over the Mission building to
M. Herzstein Tuesday evening com
plete and ready for occupancy ex
cept for the auditorium, for which
the chairs are expected to arriv
this week.
Few expected when work was
started that M. Herzstein was set
ting the high mark in modern struc
ture for northeast New Mexico and
while Mr. Herzstein is an old timer
in Clayton we feel it our sacred duty
to announce again that he is "wel
come to our city." Clayton is proud
of the Mission and or the man who
supplied tho hard cash for its erec
tion for such men are never mem
bers of the anvil chorus.
The News compliments the Bone
Construction Company on its choice
of a superintendent, W, A. Fowler,
who made it his business to follow
the plans and specifications if they
"went out the window." Mr. Fowler
employed local carpenters and told
The News without solicitation that
the local force not only proved com
petent but that they were men who
"savied" the game.
