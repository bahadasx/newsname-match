TEACHERS
TRAINED IN
H. SCHOOL
New Normal Department Has Thirty Stu
dents Enrolled and Eleven Will Re
ceive Two-Year State Certifi
cates at Close of Term
STATE SUPT. WILSON
SPENDS BUSY DAY
Delivers Four Addresses During Visit,
Students, Board Members, Teachers
and Citizens; Praises Junior
Hih School Move '
When State Superintendent Wilson
officially Inspected the new normal
department of tho Chickasha high
school Friday, he found thirly
thrifty students enrolled in it, receiv
iig the training that will equip them
for tho teaching profession. Of this
number, eleven are scheduled to com
plete the course at the close of the
year, receiving as a reward for their
efforts state certificates which wiK
entitle them to teach in the common
schools of Oklahoma for two years, i
Teacher-training in the high schools
is a new idea that was worked out
by the present state superintendent,
having been launched only this year.
Mr. Wilson discovered from statistics
that the normal schools of the state,
even when running at full capacity,
w ere by no means able to meet the de
mand for trained teachers and he
therefore conceived the plan of es
tablishing normal departments in the
various high schools of the state. De
tails of the plans were worked out by
.Mr. Wilson in conference with city
superintendents and other educators
und the matter was put up to the
school board for their acceptance.
The Chickasha board, upon the recom
mendation of Supt. Itamey, decided to
establish the department and placed
in charge of it C. L. Honnold, a man
of much experience in school work.
In the" course of his talks to stu
dents, teachers and members of the
board and citizens yesterday Supt.
Wilson explained the plan of the new
department in detail, show ing how It
is not only calculated to be of im
men-;e value in recruiting the ranks of
'.'ic teaching forces in the state but
nlso to render practical service in
equiping the graduates of the high
schools for a profession. During their
high school careers the. students, in
addition to the ordinary prescribed
studies, receive courses of instruction
in pedagogy and psychology, take re
views in til the common school
branches and are given an opportunity
to study the teaching art by visitins
the various grades, taking notes and
afterwards discussing the work with
their instructors. The last year's
work inciudes thorough courses, of six
weeks each, in reading, writing or
thography, arithmetic, grammar,
geography and physiology and tho
regular high school course includes'
agriculture, domestic art and manual
training. Under the regulations
adopted, Mr. Wilson explained, the
young teachers who receive two years'
certificates can have the same ex
tended another year provided they
upend a year in a normal school be
fore their expiration.
Mr. Wilson stated that' he found
the normal department in the Chicka
iha school fully abreast with the besi
in Uiq state. In the course of his
busy day In Chickasha he delivered
four addresses, speaking first to the
students at the chapel exercises, giv
ing them many practical suggestions
on thrift and other topics, und again
at a luncheon given by the members
of the domestic science class at which
members of the board of education
and a few citizens were guests. A'.
2 o'clock he talked to the normal stu
dents and later In the afternoon he
s.poke to the teachers and ctizens. In
addition to discussing the normal
work in detail, Mr. Wilson took oc
casion to strongly commend the junior
high school movement which Chicka
sha has taken up, declaring it would
I put the local schools in lino with the
most advanced educational Ideas, re
sulting in greater efficiency and in
creasing the number of pupils who
would complete the course and event
ually find their way into higher in-

School and Proceeds Amount to $115;
Minstrel and Other Stunts

beniors, juniors, freshmen and
sophs, teachers and all sympathizers
with the ambitious students of the
Chickasha high school are elated over
the success of the carnival given last
i'ij,kt by the seniors with the assist
ance of the other classes. The net
proceeds amounted to $113, of which
$100 was Cleared over the expense-3.
The money is to te used to buy sweat
ers for the football boys, and they were
ordered this morning.
The sideshows were in the gymnas
ium and the schedule called for the
main show to open in the auditorium
et 10 o'clock. Soon after 8 the gym
was so crowded, however, that, the
auditorium was opened, and the bU'
performance of the evening, started
about 9. A silent portryal of "The
Curfew Shall Not Fiing Tonight," was
the first number and was followed by
a Scottii.h sketch. Living pictures,
fn charge of Miss Zella Stoddard, then
thowed fourteen belles of past, pres
ent and future years, and a reading
by Miss Thelma Rose was enjoyed.
The negro minstrel was probably
the "scream" of the evening, Charles I
Hill Johns taking the part of interlo
cutor. Some original and timely jokes
were sprung by Dewey Luster and
Charles McGehee, causing much fun.
Fancy dances by Miss Frances Riddle
and whistling solo by Miss Joy Ringer
were the attractive specialties bc-
double-header
tween the acts, and a
boxing match concluded the evening's
performance.
Misses Graham and Byers who were
in charge of the carnival, are de
serving of much credit for its success,

Eighth street and Colorado put the.

The break proved bard to locate and
necessitated the cutting off of a por

until the trouble, could be located and
repaired. Some boys with, an idea
well developed along the lines of "in
