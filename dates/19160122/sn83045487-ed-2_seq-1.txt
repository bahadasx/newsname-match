COULDNT MAKE A GO
ON STATE ST. PAY
So Gertrude Wells May Dier-Her Side of It and the
Stevens' Side of It She Worked at Stevens'
Swell Store The Old Story.
Gertrude Wells Jies quite still on a
little white cot in the County hos
pital today. The .nurses don't know
whether she will live or whether she
will pass on to the place she sought
when she took ten mercury tablets a
day or so ago.
Wednesday Gertrude was one of
the thousand salesgirls who glide
about all day long over the thick
green rugs in Stevens' ladies' store
on State street ' She sold costly,
wonderful dresses that 'she couldn't
expect to wear; she took rolls of
money from, jeyld, fingers of. soci
ety women and wrapped up the
pretty clothes for them.
Her wage was one typical of State
street; it never seemed to be enough
to pay the rent for the 'little flat at
311 S. Kedzie av., where she stayed
with her aged mother. She couldn't
eat what she wanted and her dresses
were not the kind she sold every day
at Stevens' on State street.
Gertrude, she is just 23, grew tired
of the daily grind under the electric
lights at Stevens'. Month after
month she found it harder to get
along on. the jgtate-street wage. Jt
