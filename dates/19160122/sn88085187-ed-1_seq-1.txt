Minor Sees
the Ghastly
War Smile!
HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER, "1 AM STRONG." .

NEW YORK, Jan. 22.—When
1 .sailed from New York in late
September, I had a foolish notion
that it took eight days to reach j
the war zone. That is what the
I steamship agent told me.
But when New York faded
away and the straight horizon of
the sea surrounded us, I discov
ered that the zone of war was
wider than shown on the map,
and the minute a man steps onto
a belligerent nation's ship he
comes into this sphere.
HIB NAME IS HATE.
/ He travels in the mails and
on the printing press and on
omm men's, tongues. He was on that
ship. The first day out, Hate
stalked about the deck.
Whole passenger
' List Loses Its Head
I It was a ship loud of Hate.
Hate is poison to the mind,
and If ever one heard «'ra/.ler
conversations than were
heard on that boat, I should
like to know where it was.
It took but one day for the >n
t tire passenger list to lose its head.
If you don't think that it was as
bad as I say, hear this little in
cident of the second day out and
then decide whether minds had
not lost their moorings and quit
all sane valuation of human ±j!>
Itself:
I was standing on the rear
deck, watching the waves, when
4 a big, fine looking French re
servist, on his way back to fight
for "la Patrle," came up to me
with the pleasant question,
k _. «'liv in pi overboard?"
I did not care to Jump over
board and declined the Invita
tion.
He didn't care to talk about
anything else, and walked away
on the other side of the ship.
Carries "Joke" to
An Extreme Length
A few minutes later I turned
to see him climbing over the rail
ling. On the outside of the rail
ing was a narrow ledge of iron
sloping off and down the side of
•' the ship.
* He stood on this. Thinking
i he was a little too much of a
'i practical joker, I went to him
• and suggested that he had better
ft come In.
I He shook his head and smiled,
Savers are

All the wraith in the
. world is the sum total
i ] of the Barings of indi
viduals.
These individuals in
f stead of consuming
1 what has been created
fl have stored it for use
■\ in further production.
The most practical
\ way for most persons
) to do their share of
this is by using a bank
—that's one of the
chief reasons why we
ly are in business.
I PUGET SOUND
STATE BANK
I HIT Pacific Avenue
balancing himself on the edge.
"What are you going to do?"
1 asked. "Take a walk on the
water?"'
"No," he replied, "but come
I here."
When 1 came up to hear what
he had to say, he caught the front
of my coat in a firm grip, and
tried more or less gently to per
suade me to climb over the rail
ing to the ledge outside.
I tried to get on the safe side
of the rail, still thinking him
either a little drunk or else a
reckless joker.
A Smile It Was, But
of a Desperate Nature
The iron grip tightened on
my coat, and I looked into
his c-.cs, there to nee a Might
to upset mi calmness. He
RM smiling, hut there was
something desperate behind
tho smile.
I looked Into those yes for
a long five minutes while
each of us tested Ills strength
to oven nine the other. And
in those eyes I saw tragedy.
There was no one but two of
us in sight. The struggle be
came grimmer, and as each lost
breath, a bit slower. Again I
asked him what his purpose was.
He would only answer "I am
strong."
I replied, "So am I." Both of
us were.
After my mind had run the
course of those thoughts to which
one's last moments are usually
devoted. I began to see that we
were too evenly matched, that
neither could budge the other.
He released his hold and stood
on the very edge of the Incline,
slippery with spray.
"Where are you going?" I said.
He waved his hand towards the
sky.
"To heaven?" I asked, deciding
that he really was crazy.
"No, to hell," he said.
Belgian Would Slaughter
Women and Children
He lay down on his back
on the ledice and said "An
revolr." I e«mld not reach
him. He PISHED HIMSELF
OVER AMI QUIETLY ROLL-
Kl> INTO THE SEA.
I THREW him a life pre
server, and then luoked down
to see whether he had caught
It. Again I saw his eyes
looking up at nic from the
foamy water with the same
maniac smile."
HE CALMLY SWAM
AWAY ON HIS BACK.
I shimiill "Man overboard!"
running for help, but though the
ship stopped, the coming night
made search useless. I shall never
forget that smile. IT WAS A
WAR SMILE, it was the fore
runner of the many weird, Insane
things that 1 was to see in Crazy
land.
After that smile, I understood
better how it was that a Belgian
traveling with his wife and baby
could fiercely shout that all Ger
man WOMEN AND CHILDREN
MUST BE SLAUGHTERED.
Professor Goes, Probably,
to Face Firing Squad
Also I understood when the
passengers, led by a tempera
mental French count, wanted to
throw overboard a Russian pro
fesßor, because his wife, a north
Swiss, had a German accent. And
when an ex-captain of the French
army stopped another man from
discussing the right or wrong of
France's going to war, by an
nouncing brutally, "IF YOU DIS
CUSS THAT. YOU ARE SHOT.

WELLINGTON
CATASTROPHE
DUPLICATED
LEAVENWORTH, Wash., Jan. 22. At the end of
the tunnel opposite to the scene of the great Welling
ton wreck of 1910, tons of rock and snow went crash
ing down a ravine at 6:45 this morning and hurled
two passenger coaches of Great Northern train No.
25 300 feet into a gulch completely burying them.
At least 20 passengers are believed to have beeu
killed and injured. Fire of the dead already have
been dug out of the wreckage.
The Great Northern train, known as the Spokane
Owl, was standing at the entrance of the Wellington
tunnel waiting for word to clear the tracks ahead ol'
dehris when with a roar the great mass of earth and
snow came crashing down the mountainside.
The smoking car, which contained 14 passengers
and the diner were torn loose from the rest of the
train and carried down the hillside. At the bottom
they were buried deep in the pile of debris and snow.

Upon landing at Bordeaux, the

the denouncer was a deserter from

AWAY PRISONER
PORTLAND, Jan. 22—Preserv
ing liis identity for more than a
month in order to shield his fam
ily from disgrace, John Doe, on
trial here for robbing the Multno
mah station, was identified yes
terday as Percy Campbell by his
brother. An artist had made a
court sketch of the prisoner.
Law Partnership
Breaks Up With
Divorce Action
The members of the law firm
of Frank O. Riley and Mrs. Nelda
Riley, his wife, apparently were
unable to settle their differences
out of court, for Mrs. Riley,
through her attorney. Homer T.
Bone, yetserday filed a suit for
divorce in Judge Card's court,
charging non-support and incom
patibility of temperament.
After a brief secret hearing a
decree was granted, and the
bride's maiden name was re
stored.
Riley was a former athlete of
the College of Puget Sound and
also wrestling coach at the Uni
versity of Washington. He Is a
well known attorney he*"c, and
was recently a candidate for the
Tacoma school board.
Mrs. Riley is a graduate of the
University of Washington and was
one of the most prominent woman
lawyers in the city. Before her
marriage Mrs. Riley's name was
Nelda Jaeger.
The two young barristers were
married only last June and threw
their fortunes together along the
legal path, sealing a double part
nership, with offices in the Fidel
ity building.
The first intimation that there
was any friction In the firm was
about a month ago, when the male
member vacated and took offices
tn another building.
ROB GROCERY STORE
The grocery store of Ernest
Meredith, 3639 South O street,
was entered last night, and $_.'
In cash together with some candy,
stolen. Police officers attribute
the crime to boys. An attempt
was made to enter the Hicks drug
■tore, tth avenue and X street.
THE ONLY INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER IN TACOMA.
One sleeping car was torn loose
from the train, but hung totter
ing on the edge of the )ire«rl|iice.
This "act of God," as the type
of accident has been declared by
the'courts to be, occurred at
Corea, at the east end of the
horseshoe tunnel, after the train
had stood at the entrance for
more than an hour.
1010 Blumler Repented.
Just as in the 1910 catastro
phe, it is a puzzle today why the
cars, bearing scores of passen
gers, were allowed to remain ex
posed to threatened snov, slides In
stead of being hauled a few feet
to shelter within the tunnel.
That not more were killed and
injured is believed to be due to
the fact that most of the passen
gers still were in the sleeping
coaches.
Rescue Train Sent.
The train left Spokane at 8:10
last night and was due in Seattle
at 1:11 this morning.
A rescue train was rushed to
the scene this noon from Leaven
worth. It will probably be some
time before the exact number of
dead and Injured and their iden
tity can be determine.
