IN ROACH MAKES HIS FORMAL
nnnuunuunL. run uimiiuun
Gives Reasons Why Should Be Elected
to the First Place in the
State.
He is Neither the Champion of Any
Class or Industry, But of All of
the People.
Hon. Cornelius Roach, the present
efficient secretary of Mate, has now
openly avowed his candidacy for gov
ernor of the great state of .Missouri,
and in so doing has placed befoie the
voters of the state the platform on
which he stands and it U gcod
enough for any man to stand on.
In a formal statement issued from
Jefferson City this week he telle the
HON. CORNELIUS ROACH
"whole story this way:
'To the Democrats of the State:
"I am a candidate for governor, sub
Ject to the will of the Democratic
oters at the August primary. My
candidacy Is based on the conviction
that the people want the man who has
test prepared himself to render seiv
ce. "In a position second only to that of
the goernorshlp in importance, 1
have made n record, the honesty, ef
ficiency and worthiness of which, aft
er thorough Investigation, even par
tisan opponents concede. All who
have business with me know that 1 am
always found 'on the Job." Election
figures of 190S and '12 testify to tho
extensive acquaintanceship between
e and the voters, whose friendship
oil both occasions honored ine with
leading majorities.
No Class or Industry
"I am not the champion of any
class or Industry. Hy the help of the
Ipeople of all callings I expect to win.
J hRve no fad to exploit, hobby to ride,
J&or panacea to offor In an attempt to
f fnnt thla or that element into vleld-
Jng support; nor have I money to In
fluence any In ray favor. All I offer Is
a solemn pledge to render honest nnd
efficient service. That promise to all
alike I give In good faith, and point to
what I have done as the best evidence
cf what I shall do.
"Democrats and Republicans compos
Ing tho special investigating commit
tee unanimously commended my busi
ness ability, efficiency nnd economy,
when they reported that I bad con
ducted the state department, during
my Jlrst term, for $77,000.00 less than
my predecessor did his term, and
made the office earnings $220,000.00
greater; that during the first two
years of my second term, I made the
office earn as much as Its largest
earnings for any four years prior to
my incumbency: and that they could
not make a suggestion that would Ln
tr the seivlce to the public or give
it at less expense. This is the kind
cf economy and business ability 1
shall exercise as governor.
No Vaudeville Stunts
"Proposed legislation promising
special privilege, if not bribery, is
demagogical, and unbecoming any
man big enough for the state's highest
office. Vaudeville stunts for the cheap
purpose of catching popular fancy are
more fitting on the stage than on the
forum. The demagogue's success is
already too much In evidence In the
law books, and too frequent changes
ln law disturb business. The simple
duties of honest enforcement and
faithful administration cf law are
more needed than new legislation.
"The state's achievements are the
work of the Democratic party. Mis
souri's worthy activities as directed
by the party will continue to keep the
state In the front rank of American
commonwealths. Missouri under Dem
ocratic leadership has always been
nnd Is now the best and most econom
ically governed state ln the Union
Our party has always given the high
est character of public serice at but
a fraction of tho con Incurred In other
states of similar wraith and popula
tion. Our people are satisfied only
with the best at the least cost, con
sistent with modern progress.

"IT IS OUR TOWN"
1 P atte County Democrats Who Want
I the State Convention Held In
St. Joseph
That St. Joseph is the logical point
In which to hold the Democratic state
convention goes without saying and
further the holding of the big stato
gathering here would be of great bene
fit to this city, therefore, It Is all the
more necessary that all efforts should
be utilized in that direction. Tho
people all over the territory adjacent
are enthusiastic over the proposition
and will give all required aid nnd
support. Just as an Instance it might
be well to give the views of the Platte
county friends of this city, who,
while nearer to Kansas City than St.
Joseph, are pulling earnestly for St.
Joseph. In Its last issue the Land
mark of Platte City says:
St. Joseph wants the Democratic
state convention and every man in
Platte wants It to get it. Henry Dil
lingham, member of the Democratic
state committee from Platte county,
says :
I "I am for St. Joseph for the conven-
tlon. It is accessible, well provided
with hotels, and has a fine auditor
ium, large enough to accommodate
the state meeting."
i CoU James H. Hull: "I am for St.
, Joeph. It's In our section of the state
1 and is well fixed as a convention
town."
Judge A. D. Humes says "I am for
St. Joseph and hope It will get the
convention."
Hon. Guy Park says: "It Is the
place for state conventions and ha3
some of the best and largest hotels
In the country and a convention hall
that will hold any number of peoplo
, that may attend. Put me down for
St. Joseph.
! "It's the best town In the state for
a state convention, says ram wens
'and St. Josenh ought to get It. It is
not too large nor yel too small a town
ences."
And these are the sentiments of
every person we have seen, and Platte
county will be for St. Joseph because

Despite the fact that Speaker
Champ Clark stated while in St. Jo
seph last fall that under no circum
stances would he run for governor of
Missouri, and followed It up the other
day by a letter couched in as strong
language as he could make it, in
which he reiterated his statement
here. It did not preent Harry Hawes
of St. Louis from making a trip to
Washington this week, seeking to
have Missouri's famous son change his
mind but he did not succeed and he
will not.
A Washington dispatch says that
Hawes left there Tuesday, after two
dajs spent in conferences with
Speaker Clark and Senator Stone.
Hawes wanted the speaker to recon
sider his announcement that he would
not run for governor, but Hawes re
turned home with definite word from
Speaker Clark that he would not con
sider the governorship that he was
needed In Washington.
The New York World carried a
story Tuesday morning to the effect
that Clark had rejected the oveitures
to run for governor becaause of the
oxlstence of a pact with Bryan against
Wilson. Friends of the speaker say
he Is Indignant at the story. The
speaker refuses to discuss Bryan or
Wilson "rumors," as he calls them.

yVHIISELL'S STATEMENT
He Will Not Be Able to Run for
Mayor, but He Will Help Elect
a Democrat
To My Personal Friends Who Have
Asked Me to Make the Race for
Ma or, to the Members of the
Whitsell for Mayor Club, and the
Democrats of St. Joseph:
I take this means and opportunity
to answer the numerous requests
made by my personal friends, and by
the members of the Whitsell for
Mayor club, that I become a candidate
for mayor of St. Joseph at the coming
election; also I address the Demo
crats, generally, from a viewpoint not
ipartisan or personal to myself.
To those who prefer me as the stan
dard bearer, I here make the assur
ance of my personal gratitude and of
a careful consideration of the entire
situation.
While I am highly grateful to those
of you who have asked me to be the
Democratic standard bearer of the
DR. JOHN C. WHITSELL
eitj and would most cheerfully comply
with our requests, I have taken the
mmti.r mi .ith time in0,i in tho
,aw and am ,nformed that n)y can(U
jdacy would not be legal. I have been
practicing In the city since 1907, and
hae resided therein most of the time.

I sel has reported, my residence in tho
city must have been during three
years next before the date of such
election.
Although I am disqualified from
making the race at this time, there
are Democrat who are qualified, and
from these we must select a candl
date for mayor. At this time the out
look for Democratic success Is most
flattering. The candidate upon whom
we unite will be the next mayor of
St. Joseph.
Assuring you of my hearty co-opera
tion with our efforts in the election
of a live wire Democrat for mayor,
and of my earnest belief in the suS'
cess of the Democratic party, I re

CIS. I. DHREHSTEIN,
DRESSES APPRECIATIVE
He Handled His Subject in a Way That
Made His Meaning Entirely
Clear.
His Many Hearers Much Impressed With
the Scope and Power of His
Discourse.
"Mankind has long sought in many ways and by many means for peace,"
A. B. PIckell said in introducing Charles I. Ohrensteln, C. S. B., who on Sun
day afternoon delivered a lecture on Christian Science at First Church of
Christ, Scientist. "Even as late as the sixteenth century there was supposed
to exist a fountain whose waters would preserve the innocence of perpetual
jouth. These words of Jesus of Nazareth, 'My peace I leave with you, and
not as the world giveth, give I unto you,' find grateful response today in the
hearts of thousands to whom Christian Science has brought health, happiness
and some measure of 'the peace that passeth understanding.' In gratitude is
this opportunity afforded to learn more of this healing truth, 'Ho, everyone
that thirsteth! Come je to the waters.' Drink freely and may they spring up
within you as fountains of everlasting Joy. I am glad to introduce Mr. Charles
I. Ohrensteln, C. S. B., of Syracuse, N. Y., member of the board of lectureship
of The Mother Church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Mass."
The speaker said:
In the discussion cf any subject it , finite or concise; and since God is
is always desirable and helpful to our life, must not the knowledge of
start with some point of agreement, life and all that it includes be the
Notwithstanding all our (Uversifkd ' knowledge of God and of man's re
views and varied experiences, lt us ! latlonship to God? The Importance
ste if it is not possible for us to find of this knowledge is also shown by
some such point. One that very na- j the statement, "Acquaint now thyself
turally presents Itself, and upon which j with him (God), and be at peace,"
all would probably agree, will un- and the bible is full of assurances
doubtedly be found in the fact that that to know God and to be obedient
we all desire to live. But even If we to him means health, freedom, pros
live, there is not much satisfaction perity, happiness, and all that is de-
in living without bodily comfort or
health; for health Is absolutely es
sential to peace, freedom, prosperity
and happiness.
Were we to ask ourselves the ques
tion, "How may we live, be well, fiee,
prosperous, happy?" there would be
nothing new about it, for the ques-
tion is as old as human questioning,
Neither has there been any dearth of
answers to this question. Mere theo-1
retical answers are valueless, how
ever, and this has been shown in the
experience of the race by the fact
that life still appears uncertain, and
health, peace, freedom, prosperity,
and happiness have been attained by
comparatively few, and then only in
limited degree. Consequently, the
answer to our question would have
to be in a system of education or un
derstanding that would give health.
May we not, then, ask ourselves
whether any practical system cf ed
ucation exists which teaches how we
may live, be well, free, prosperous,
and happy? More than this, since the
subject we are to discuss is religion,
may we not further ask whether the
religion of the bible, and more partic
ularly the religion of Jesus Christ
provides suih a system and the t
rett Interpretation cf It, the educa
tion capable of accomplishing the
Jesired result?
Bible Answers the Question
The Christianity of Jesus Christ
was the vision of the seers of Israel.
It was their hope, their prayer, their
ideal and aspiration for mankind
It was expected to usher in health,
peace, ana plenty, the reign of God
nnd of the Messiah, and to protest
against any other reign.
If we first turn to the old bible,
the bible cf the Hebrews, accepted
by all Christians, we shall find plain
simple, and direct answers to the
question under consideration . The
first thing needed In a quest of any
kind Is an acquaintance with that
which is sought. If the research Is
for life and Its felicities, the first
thing needful is to learn what life If
Now. haTe any of the sciences through
ull the research of the ages discov
ered what H) Is? Not one of them.
This being the case, the generally
accepted methods are seeking they
know not what. Is such a quest like
ly to be successful? With all respect
(or the men who have been and nre
engaged In such research, and for
their devoted efforts, Is not this nn
example of the blind leading the blind,
nnd will It not of necessity continue
to fall in Its purpope?
The bible, on the other hand,
oaks upon this question definitely
and with great authority. In Deuto
onomy we read, "He (God) Is thy
Ife" Could anjthing Le more de-
c. s. b. nu
E
sirable.
That the bible says these things,
all will admit; that its teachings arm
true and binding, all religionists
should admit. Bur the bible and
by this for the present we are con-
. tent to mean the old testament does
j not satisfy itself by making mere
i assertions. It substantiates its teach
i ings by citing innumerable instances
which prove them. Naaman's heal-
lng of leprosy; the providing for the
Shunammlte woman; the healing and
restoration to life of her son; tho
preservation of the lives of the three
young men in the fiery furnace, and
of Daniel In the lion's den; the eman
cipation of the children of Israel from
Egypt, their sustenance and healing
throughout their sojourn in the wilder
ness; the bringing of them into the
prosperity of the promised land; the
proof rliat death Is not inevitable, in
the translation of Enoch and Elijah
these and other instances will recur
to all.
Spiritual Healing Reverent
But here our good friends of other
denominations may exclaim, "'God in
deed did these things in the good old
bible times, but to claim such things
noMule in our time is blasphemous.
Others may content themselves with
dismissing the?e things as mere leg
ends or myths.
May it not be said that if It be
blasphemous to expect God to do
these good and needful things now,
that it was always blasphemous?
Again, If these things are mere myths
or legends, is not the whole fabric of
religious teaching mythical and leg
endary? Such assertions may furnish
easy ways of brushing aside the cen
tral and tremendous facts of religious
history. Before this is done, before
the ancient bible worthies are set
down as either blasphemous or un
truthful, would It not be well to con
sider that possibly these ancient seers
and prophets really had some glimpses
of a "--Dwiedge qt God unknown to
modern thinkers, which enabled them
to prove that God Indeed '"giveth to
all life, and breath, and all things,"
and that he is In truth the only savior
Glimpses of a knowledge of God.
Wonderful as their works appear to
us, glimpses are all these men
claimed to have, for their prediction
was that In the fullness of time one
would appear who would reveal God
full : who would be the representa
tive of God and fulfill all righteous
ness, save, redeem, and deliver be
Immanuiil. "God be with ug." In the
fullness of time he came. Did he
suit the mighty men, the senators,
ecribee, so-called scientists ami re
llflous leaders of bis time? Net t
