NEW PRESIDENT OF
INAUGURATION OF DR. RAY LY
MAN WILBUR WITH LITTLE
FORM OR CEREMONY.
(1)7 Associated Press.)
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
Jan. 22. Ray Lyman Wilbur, A. M.p
M. D., was installed today as presi
dent of Leland Stanford, Jr., Univer
sity, in a ceremony of perhaps un
equalled simplicity in an institution
of similar grade. He suceeds Dr. John
Casper Branner, who relinquished the
presidency December 7, 1915, Dr.
David Starr Jordan, first president of
the university, who preceded Dr. Bran
ner, 18 now chancellor. Dr. Wilbur is
forty years old, and was one of the
first students at Stanford, which is
Bald to have the second largest endow
ment of any institution of learning in
America.
Flowers, banners, colors, robes and
gowns, and the cermonial features
frequently accompanying them In edu
cational events, were almost wholly
wanting, in deference to Dr. Wilbur's
known disapproval of anything tend
ing to make education undemocratic
or to cany that Impression. The
tiled roofs and low red sandstone
walls of the university buildings were
undecorated, and participants in the
ceremonies for the msot part wore
business suits. Another precedent
was upset when Dr. Wilbur announced
that he preferred to appear first of all
before the student body, and did so
yesterday, sweeping aside suggestions
from those who felt it more fitting
that his inauguration begin with an
address to trustees, faculty and
alumni.
