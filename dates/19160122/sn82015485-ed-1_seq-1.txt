What Good Does a Lost or
Stolen Check Book Do?
We baae just had an illustration of the value of
paying: in checks your bills, as the robbers did not
take checks, they took only the money they found
in the the safe.
Thus the merchants can give you credit on your
account, wheras had you paid the cash, it would
of have gone and the record of who paid it not left.
Thus you help yourself and the merchant by
usinjr your check. ,
V.'e have plenty of checkbooks for use and
plenty of good insurance to protect you and us.

To Whom It May Concern
The silly story being circulated
that the Wm. Shrenkler Elevator is
owned by Wm. Schrenkier, Herman
Loner, II. J. Hille, F.-S. Diebold and
J. F. Jones 13 wholly false and untrue
and that none of the above named
gentlemen, except Wm. Schrenkier,
are in any way interested in said
elevator, financially or otherwise, and
we believe this gossip is beinsr circul
ated for the purpose of influencing
local business. The above statement
would be signed by Mr. Diebold were

last fall and they were also the
means of organizing a city band
which is doing good work and they
have other things in view . for the
future that will be of benefit to the
town. Theclnb should receive the
support of the general public for
their good work in behalf of the
town and the Garden Theater should
be crowded next Wednesday evening
to hear Meressa Thompson in "Re
becca of Sunny Brook Farm.'
Dictagrams
The next president of the United
States will part his whiskers in the
middle.
Yes of course, the next president
may be smooth shaven but in that
case I refuse to be held responsible
for bis whiskers.
In other words, the Dictagramer is
absolutely neutral. - Even a broad
dental display will not provoke him
into an act of hostility. That is, not
at this time.
Certainly we have are hopes, desires
and opinions: also, on very rare
occasions we have sense enough to
keep still.
There is a lady in this town who
has -two p!d hens shut- up in a box
where neighbors can't see them and
one of those hens belongs to some
other woman. Her excuse is that
two hens stay together better than!
one.
How very accomodating the weath-j
er is up in Michigan. A recent report
saia "snow enougti lor sleighing but
too deep for autos."
Once in a while you hear a story
which consists mostly of such express
ions as "tins man, ' --that other guv."
That is the way some people relate a
story or an incident, and when it is
finished the hearer knows less about
it than he did before.
And there is that other style of
story telling which continually em
ploys the "sezzee an' I sez, sezzi"
expression. An hour of sworn test
imony by such linguists as the two
here described will fail to bring out
one positive statement of fact.
As a rule, the criminal -gets more
bouquets than the philanthropist.
Let us prove that there are excep
tions by patronizing the entertain
ment to be given next week by the
ladies of the Locust Club. The fin
ancial profits, if any there be, will be
devoted to civic improvements and
this fact should commend the enter
prise of all public-spirted citizens.
MARKET REPORT
Kansas City Stock Yards. Jan.18, 1916.
After some haggling today, steers
sold at steady prices, a three car
drove of 1450 lb. natives bringing
$8.75, the top. Butcher cattle sold
strong and actively, and stockers and
feeders were firm. Most of the beef
steers- ranged from $7.50 to $8.40, and
commonish steeis now sell at $7 to
87.60. Prime steers would sell around
$9.25. Receipts were 13,000 head and
carried a larger proportion of beef
cattle than usual. The whole cattle
market is moving onto a higher level
with irresistible force, though in a
slow and orderly manner. Butcher
cattle find ready sale at strong prices,
good heavy cows at $5.90 to $6.75, a
few up to $7.25. Baby heifers, weigh
ing 580 lbs. sold at $10 yesterday.
Heavy bulls sell at $5.65 to $6.25, and
veal calves $9 to $10.50. Cattle from
the sugar mills iu the West and hay
fed cattle are not yet moving in any
considerableJumbers, a few 1200-1 b.
Coloradosteers here yesterday at $8.00.
Stockers and feeders are selling firm,
and there was a good assortment here
yesterday, largely from Colorado, good
bred yearlings and twos' selling at
$6.90 to $7.65. Stock steers range,
from $6.15 to $7.65, and feeders from
$7 to $7.50, a few fleshy feeders around
$8. Receipts today were considerably
above expectations, but efforts of buy
ers to secure-a declne were unsuccess
ful. Beef outlet is wide open, and is
reported that packing house gangs
were kept busy Sunday loading cars
with beef. s
H Hog receipts were 18,000 head, mar
ket 15 to- 25 higher. Top price was
$7.45, bulk of sales $7.10 to $7.35.
It was a fast market, and prices kept
growing stronger- all through the
session. The hog market has beeu
out of line with cattle and sheep, but
it is fast undergoing readjustments.
Immense traffic in pork product is the
keynote of the very strong situation,
with some slackening of the supply
volume making it still easier for sell
ers to advance the price. Average
weight here last week, was 207 lbs.
four pounds more than previous week
and seven more than same week last
year. Sheep and lambs sold steady
today, numerous lots of peafed lambs,
the best here at $10.60. A feature
today was two cars of North Colorado
ewes, 103 lbs, at $7.25, high spot this
season. Yearlings went - to $8.90,
though choice ones are worth $9.25,
to maintain its equilibrium, and ap
wethers worth up to $8, feeding lambs
$9 to $9.25. The market looks top
heavy, but shows surprising ability
pears more firmly grounded every day.

Market Correspondent.
Things over at Charlie Steele's
Barber shop came very near being
blown out into the street last Monday-morning
when the proprietor
built a fire in the bath room in the
plant used for heating water. The
pipes were frozen and when the tire
became warm zip a big pane of glass
soon lay on the front side walk.
Bursted pipes poured out a stream of
water, the stove pipe was blown down
and things were tore up in general. No
one was injured and the damage done
was particularly serious but mighty
disagreeable sort of an accident to
clean up after.
Mr. and Mrs. DI P. Roberts are
made happy by the visit of their
daughter and husband, Mr. and Mrs.
Chapman of Minnesota, they are also
accompanied by their small daugh
ter. Grandpa and Grandma Roberts
are double happy on account of the
presence of this little grandchild
whom they have not seen for a long
while.
A. J. Johnson after quite along and
severe sick spell is again able to be
about and .his friends were glad to
see his cheerful contenance once
more.
