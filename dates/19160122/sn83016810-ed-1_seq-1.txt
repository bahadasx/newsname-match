MRS. ASQUITH AND
LADY HAIG ACTIVE
Husbands' Elevation to High
Positions Accredited to Them.
HAVE GREAT INFLUENCE.
Great Britain Prime Minister's Wife
of Material Assistance to Him, and
She Is Probably Most Influential Wo
man In English PoliticsLady Httfa/*
Also Powerful.
London.Two women, Mrs. Asquith
and Lady Haig, are playing an active
part in Great Britain's politics. To
their work is accredited the elevation
of their husbands to high positions.
The action brought by Mrs. Asquith,
the wife of the prime minister, against
the London Globe to restrain its editor
from publishing any more letters from
its readers indirectly referring to her
as a friend of German prisoners of
war interned in Donnington Hall had
much more behind it than the extreme
ly courageous action of an independent
and fearless woman.
The prime minister's wife is probably
the most influential woman in English
politics in modern days. The late
Duchess of Devonshire, the "Double
Duchess," as she was called because
she captured two ducal titles in succes
sion, that of the seventh holder of tho
Manchester title and the eighth of
Devonshire, could perhaps have had
greater political power if she could
have persuaded the indolent Duke of
Devonshire to accept the office of prime
minister. Mrs. Asquith, on the other
hand, is commonly believed to have
materially assisted her husband to this
high office. His enemies have always
been legion and his friends not numer
ous, his character being that of the
serious Scotsman who forms emotional
ties with difficulty.
Mrs. Asquith, brilliant, witty, tem
peramental and intellectual and in
variably entertaining, has supplied this
deficiency and by her tact and charm
she has kept unimpaired many politi
cal friendships useful to her husband.
The withdrawal of the British forces
from the Gallipoli peninsula is credited
to Mrs. Asquith's advice, coupled with
the recommendation of Major General
C. C. Monro, who succeeded General
Sir Ian Hamilton as commander at the
Dardanelles, which was made public in
the house of lords by Lord Ribblesdale.
Mrs. Asquith's brother-in-law.
Lady Haig, the wife of General Sir
Douglas Haig, who has taken over the
command of the British troops in
France as the successor of Field Mar
shal Viscount French, is credited with
having exerted great influence toward
her husband's advancement in the
army. She was the Hon. Maud Vivian,
one of the "Vivian twins," who were
famous as maids of honor to Queen
Victoria and Queen Alexandra. Before
his marriage to Miss Vivian ten years
ago Haig was a favorite with General
French, having served under French
at Aldershot and then accompanying
him to South Africa during the Boer
war. Whatever French has been able
to do for Haig has been done, but his
present high command is the result
more of the influence at court of Lady
Haig, and Lord Kitchener has been
persuaded by royalty's desires to ad
vance the man most favored by his
old enemy, General French. Sir Doug
las Haig was promoted to be a full
general only a year ago, although he
had held the post as chief of staff in
India for some years, having won it
through the influence of King Edward
and Queen Alexandra.
Sir Douglas and Lady Haig have not
taken any particular pains to assume
any leadership in London society since
their marriage and have not kept up a
London residence during visits home
from India, spending their time at Al
dershot, where Haig earned the nick
name of "Von Haig" on account of his
Prussian thoroughness in military mat
ters and his stern way of handling sub
ordinates. He and Lady Haig have
two children, daughters, named after
the two queens whom Lady Haig I
servedAlexandra Henrietta Louise,
born in 1907, and Victoria Doris Ra
chel, born in 1908.

Altoona, Pa.Kenneth Geist, aged

He was admitted to the hospital on
Christmas, 1913, suffering from tuber

Doctor Insists Victim Is Nothy
Longer Menace to Workmen.
Ann Arbor, Mich.Ignorant that he
was suffering from leprosy in an ad
vanced stagethe physician who had
sent him had not diagnosed the dis
easea man came to Dr. Udo Wile of
the medical faculty of the University
of Michigan last July. He was a piti
able object His body was covered
with leprous lesions.
Dr. Wile took the sufferer into the
university general hospital and has
treated him with chaul-moogra oil, a
remedy for leprosy that has been used
for generations in India, unsuccessful
ly in the great majority of cases.
Now his disease, which oftenest con
demns a man to life confinement in a
colony of his fellow sufferers, is ar
rested. The patient is making a splen
did recovery, Dr. Wile says. He is
strong and walks two miles each day.
No more men shame him by calling
him "unclean."
He is no more dangerous to any com
munity now than a tuberculosis pa
tient. Dr. Wile insists. The doctor
adds:
"Work is given to a tuberculosis pa
tient who is able to work. No one
questions his duty and right to support
himself and his family. Work should
be given to this man, once the most
despised and feared of humansa
leper."
The man's name is withheld that,
unknown, he may begin life anew and
earn bread for his wife and their baby.
His entry into the hospital was affect
ing, dramatic.
It so happened that a medical con
vention was being held here, and the
different clinics were open to the visit
ing physicians. Dr. Wile had not seen
the patient until he was wheeled into
the clinic. The doctor's face went
white. Visitors leaned forward and
peered upon the man's nude body. Their
faces were tense, for they knewthey
thought him doomed.
The examination soon over, the pa
tient was wheeled out, and Dr. Wile
said, with emotion:
"That man has a well advanced case
of leprosy. I must tell him, and it
will seem to him like reading his death
warrant. When his disease becomes
known it is doubtful if we can keep
him here. Even if the leprosy cannot
be arrested the man has ten years yet
before him in which he might earn a
living were it not that he will be
hounded from place to place every
man's hand will be against him."
"Is he curedwill he ever be abso
lutely cured?" Dr. Wile was asked.
"A cure is always relative," answer
ed the doctor. "At present all the
symptoms that characterize leprosy
have disappeared in this case. He is
strong, confident, hopeful. If you ask
me whether the leprous symptoms will
reappear I can no more tell you than I
can assure a man healthy today that
he will be in health as good ten or fif
teen years hence."

OVER 240 NEW GAME
LAWS ENACTED BY U.S.
Agricultural Department Press
es Campaign of Protection.
W ashington.The department of ag
riculture has inaugurated a vigorous
campaign for the protection of game
under the federal law and is aiding the
various states in carrying out their
statutes.
More than 240 new game laws were
enacted during 1915a larger number
than in any previous year except 1911.
Forty-three states held regular legis
lative sessions, and in all of these
states except Arizona, Georgia and Ne
braska some changes were made in the
statutes protecting game. The largest
number of new game laws passed in
any one state was sixty-one, in North
Carolina, but in California, Connecti
cut, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon, Penn
sylvania and Wisconsin the number
reached ten or more. Several measures
were vetoed, including a general game
bill in Idaho, the first bill appropriating
the hunting license fund in Pennsylva
nia, a bill protecting bears in Califor
nia and three sections of the game bill
in Washington state.
A number of bills were introduced
for the purpose of harmonizing the
state laws on migratory birds with
the federal regulations. In at least
nine states changes were made which
brought the seasons into substantial
agreement namely, California, Con
necticut, Maine, Michigan, New Hamp
shire, Tennessee and West Virginia.
In Illinois the seasons for all migra
tory birds except coot and waterfowl
and in Washington for the smaller
shore birds were made to conform with
the regulations under the federal law.
Uniformity was also secured by pro
visions in the laws of Connecticut.
Maine, New Mexico, North Dakota,
Washington and Wisconsin, prohibit
ing bunting between sunset and sun
rise. On the other hand, Delaware
adopted a resolution opposing the mi
gratory bird law, and Ohio and Rhode
Island, which had harmonized their
seasons In 1914, changed the seasons
on waterfowl this year.
As a result of the decision of the
supreme court of the United States on
Jan. 19, 1914, sustaining the alien
hunting law of Pennsylvania, legisla
tion prohibiting aliens from hunting or
owning shotguns or rifles was enacted
in at least four statesMassachusetts,
New Jersey, North Dakota and West
Virginiabut certain exceptions based
on property qualifications were made
in Massachusetts and New Jersey

FUELLESS ENGINE
QUEST ENDS AT 93
Called by Death After Working
on it Seventy Years.
TAKES SECRET TO GRAVE.
Before Dying Would Be Inventor of
Minneapolis Destroyed All Charts or
Mechanical Contrivances He Had
Made In Search For Perpetual Mo
tion Machine.
Minneapolis, Minn.When John La
ney, ninety-three years old, was laid to
rest in Crystal Lake cemetery a sev
enty year quest for the secret of "per
petual motion" came to a fruitless end.
So close did he think himself to the
secret at times that he trembled with
expectancy. For seventy years, despite
his disappointments! his mind aflame
with ambition, Lanpy worked, think
ing, experimenting.
Meanwhile this man, a Scotchman by
birth and a stonemason by trade, whose
only relaxation was reading the workus
orBacoZThakespeaVe7co1erTdgrand
au
Wordsworth, smashed and destroyed
contrivance after contrivance when it
failed. Then with intensified energy
he concentrated on a new idea.
"It almost worked."
These three words tell the life story
of a man gifted in some ways beyond
his fellow men. John,Laney wanted
his name to go down in history, but al
ways when he fancied he was at the
very edge of accomplishment it was
only to find the something missing in a
contrivance that "almost worked."
"When I was just a little girl father
used to have the kitchen table cleared
for him when supper was over," said
Mrs. Lizzie Welton, at whose home
the aged man spent his last days.
"He had a groove in the table and a
round stone hall that he made himself.
He would roll this round and round,
and often mother would have to get
up ,late at night and beg him to stop
and rest.
"Father had a good education, most
ly self acquired. He loved the poets,
and he wrote several songs, one for
the St. George guards of St. George,
New Brunswick, where we once lived.
He was a sculptor alsfc"
Outside the steps of the cosy cot
tage where Mrs. Welton lives are two
pieces of granite. One has on it fig
ures of Hiawatha and Minnehaha the
other has on it a bear and two cubs.
Inside the house, highly treasured, is a
chain five feet long, with many links
and an anchor at the end, that was cut
out with a jackknife from a solid piece
of wood. Many small mementoes re
main.
But before he died John Laney de
stroyed all charts or mechanical con
trivances he had made in his search
for perpetual motion. One day he
said to his daughter:
"Perpetual motion will yet be found.
There is no doubt of it. When it is
found the world will be astonished not
alone by the stupendous changes that
it will bring in all industrial life, but
by the simplicity of it. Millions will
wonder why no one ever thought of it
before."
"I am an old man," he would often
say. "I saw the coming of the rail
roads, the telegraph, the automobile
and the more wonderful things of
later years. I predicted back in 1850
that the world would one day see the
horseless wagon, and it is here. Ah,
if I could only just get the one little
missing link!"

DIVORCES WITHOUT JUDGE?
Lawyers, Apparently, May Grant One
In California.
Los Angeles.Judges and lawyers
learned with surprise that through an
amended provision of the state consti
tution apparently any qualified attor
ney may grant a decree of divorce.
This became known by the recent
1 granting of three decrees in Santa
Rosa by attorneys sitting as judges pro
tempore after having been selected to
try the actions of the litigants them
selves without the sanction of the
court The modified amendment reads:
"A case in the superior court may be
tried by a judge pro tempore, who must
be a member of the bar, agreed upon
in writing by the parties litigant or
their attorneys of record and sworn to
try the cause, and the person so select
ed shall be empowered to act in such
capacity in all further proceedings in
any suit or proceedings tried before
him until the final determination there-

Sabetha, Kan.An organization of

TABLET FOR INDIAN
FRIEND OF WHITES
Seattle Professor Seeks to
Honor Chief Pat Kanim,
Seattle, Wash.Professor Edward S.
Meany of the University of Washing
ton is arousing public interest in the
memory of old Chief Pat Kanim of the
Snoqualmie and Snohomish Indians.
Chief Pat, a stanch friend of the early
whites, is one of the forgotten heroes
of pioneer days, and Professor Meany
wants his grave marked with a suit
able monument.
In the days when settlers had reason
to fear the lurking red foes in the deep
forests Chief Pat Kanim's people were
powerful where Everett now stands.
It is not known just when the chief
died, but he was buried on a bank of
the Snohomish river.
When the grave was threatened by
the overflowing river relatives moved
the remains to the little cemetery on
the Tulalip Indian reservation, where
many of the tribes he ruled in power
now live in humble homes.
Bancroft's "History of Washington"
tells of the chiefs craftiness in driving
Glasgow and Rabbeson from the first
settlement on Whidby island in 1848.
He made a great drive with dogs and
secured sixty deer for a feast of assem
bled warriors. He counseled in favor
of driving the white men out of the
country.
Glasgow and Rabbeson went back to
Tumwater, and the next year Pat Ka
nim led an assault on Fort Nisqually.
While Pat Kanim was parleying inside
the stockade his brother was killed
leading an attack by the Indians. Pat
Kanim was spared, and in 1850 he
made a trip to San Francisco in a sail
ing vessel. What he saw on that jour
ney made him resolve to become a
friend of the white man. He faithfully
lived up to that resolution for the rest
of his life.

Sand Springs Okla.This town was

The town was founded by Charles
Page, multimillionaire oil producer of
His earliest recollections were of his
mother's efforts to raise her large fam-!
ily unaided, and he resolved that when
he grew up he would take care of ail
the widows.
When he made his fortune Page
founded Sand Springs. He built doz
ens of comfortable cottages in which
gas, fuel and rent were free. Facto
ries he bought so the widows might
have employment
He built a car line to Tulsa upon
which widows ride free. There are a
day nursery, free medical attendance
and a vocational school. If a widow
wants to get married Page helps her
do that He likes grandmothers too
There are a score of them here, with
nothing to do but knit and read and
reminisce.
Page probably has more "children"
than any other man in the world. An

house and its inhabitants, which fol
lows:
The ancient Dyckman homestead,
which stands on a knoll at the corner
of Broadway and Two Hundred and
Fourth street, is unquestionably the
only remaining dwelling house on Man
hattan Island built by a Dutch family
in accordance with the past Dutch tra
ditions.
Times have gone by, and many
changes have occurred. The last of the
family bearing the name in the vicin
ity died recently in the person of Mrs.
Fannie Blackweil Brown, widow of the
late Isaac Michael Dyckman and her
self of Dyckman descent in several
lines. Her two daughters, Mrs. Bash
ford Dean, who was Mary Alice Dyck
man, and Mrs. Alexander McMillan
Welch, who was Fannie Frederlcka
Dyckman, have as the last of the
Kingsbridge Dyckmans decided to per
petuate the old Dyckman house in
memory of their parents.
The Dyckman house in question was
built at the end of the war of independ
ence, about 1785, as nearly as records
go. It was then that the family return
ed to their lands after the perils of the
war. Their ancient home, which had
been built opposite the present one,
nearer the river, had been burned down
by the British So a new house was
built on ground which was somewhat
higher and nearer tne post road.
James Dyckman and Dr. Jacobus
Dyckman were early graduates of Co
lumbia college (1809-1811). Both died
young, one a lawyer and the other a
distinguished physicianhe was health
commissioner of New York, author and
scientist It was he who is said to have
obtained for Columbia college when he
was secretary of the old Philosophical
society of this city the relics of Benja
min Franklin which it now has. Jaco
bus Dyckman, son of the builder of the
house, was one of the best known men
in New York, long time alderman and
a member of the constitutional conven
tion in 1821.
It was Jacobus Dyckman who took
an especial liking to his young grand
son, Isaac Michael Dyckman, which
led ultimately to his coming to stay in
the Kingsbridge household. He was
then a boy of seven, the second son of
Jacobus Dyckman's daughter Hannah,
who had married Squire Caleb Smith
of Yonkers. So his name was not origi
nally Dyckman. The Dyckman estate
was so large it required great care in
its upkeep. So it came about that Mr.
Isaac Dyckman, the surviving bachelor
uncle, looked ultimately to his nephew
for help. At that time, it appeared, Mr.
Isaac Dyckman had probably more real
property in his hands than any other
single property owner of Manhattan
has had before or since. At his death
in 1868 it was found that his estate
was to be divided among his various
hephews and nieces. His favorite
nephew, however, received the major
part but with the proviso that his
name should be changed by the legisla
ture from James Frederick Dyckman
Smith to Isaac Michael Dyckman.
The latter did not retain the house a
part of his heritage. It was no longer
as he remembered it and he had him
self built a house in the northern part
of the property not far from his un
cle's. In fact, the old house had chang

had gone awayto the old Indian cem
etery formerly on the corner of Broad
way and Dyckman street Then, too.
Mr. Dyckman found that the approach
of a great city meant heavy assess
ments and taxes, when, hi order to
have parts of his tract developed, he
should practically make people pres
ents of his leaseholds. Indeed, it was
this Jan Dyckman who devised for this
whole region the farsighted plan of
letting tenants have property for al
most nothing in order that the future
returns might be assured. One of his
famous leases gave a tenant a valuable
farm for one hen a year for seven
years! %$
