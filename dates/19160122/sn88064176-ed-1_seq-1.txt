"Your project of an interna

lieve in Jesus Christ as God and
Savior to accomplish the speedy
fulfillment of the final prayer of
the Lord, that all may be one, I
have, in obedience to your re
quest, submitted to the most
r'--b- sed father.
"I nd-Rotjhere describe the
affection with w saw the
august pontiff kindled for
"For you well know that the
plans of the Roman pontiffs,
their cares and their labors have
always been specially directed to
the end that the sole and unique
church which Jesus Christ or
dained and sanctified with His
d vine blood should be most
zealously guarded and maintain
ed, whole, pure and ever abound
ing in love and that it should
both let its light shine and open
wide its door for all who rejoice
in the name of man and who de
sire to gain holiness upon earth
and eternal happiness in Heaven.
"The august pontiff, there
fore was pleased with your pro
ject of examining in a sincere
spirit and without prejudice the
essential form of the church, 'or
the inner essence of the church.'
"He earnestly hopes that un
der the spell of its native beauty
you may settle all disputes and
work with prosperous issue to
the end that the mystical body
of Christ be no longer suffered
to be rent and torn, but that by
harmony and co-operation of
men's minds and likewise by the
concord of their wills, unity of
faith and communion may at last
prevail throughoutthe world of
men.
"Thanking you, then that you
have thought well to request the
aid and support of the Roman
pontiff in expediting your wor
thy project his holiness expresses
his earnest desire that the end
may answer your expectation.
S"He asks the same of Christ
Jesus with fervent prayers, all
the more because, with the voice
orbf Christ himself sounding be
fore and bidding him he knows
that he h!mself, as the one to
Swhom all men have been given
over to be fed, is the source and
cause of the unity of the church."

to discharge the duties of the of
fice to the best interest of the v

Ship's Under-Water Eye Sights Hidden
Mine.
To assist battleships and de
stroyers in locating submerged
mines, an American has develop
ed an under-sea searchlight
equipment which, when used in
conjunction with a special water
glass, makes it possible to distin
guish objects at a distance of 200
feet. A powerful electric lamp
is mounted on one side of a ves
sel below the water line, at its
bow. This may be turned to
different angles by an operator
on deck. Immediately forward
of this is the glass, similar to a
Smodified periscope, forming the
e ship's under-sea eye and used to
rfollow the illuminated path.
When a mine is located in a ves
[ sel's course a torpedo is launched
iwhich may be discharged elec
trically. This is watched and at
the proper instant detoned, thus
exploding the mine. It is be
e lieved that the device could also
'be used on mine sweepers to ad
t vantage.--Popular Mechanics

where he went. The Minden Signal

of his funeral and brief sketch of his
life:
Never has there been such an out
pouring of people in this section.
Friends (he had no enemies) came from
all walks in life to pay the last respect
to one of our most beloved and promi
nent citizens. The negroes who had
been employed by him in the great in
dustries, respectfully joined the sor
rowful procession as it neared the cem
etery. During the funeral all business
was suspended, The mill was hushed
and it seemed that every one in the
community was paving honor to all that
was mortal of this beloved man. The
floral gifts were of unusual beauty and
in countless numbers. The sacred
mound was covered with brightest and
most beautiful blossoms and the grave
robbed of all its gloom. Friends from
Wisconsin, New Orleans, St. Louis,
3 Texarkana, Shrevesport, Stamps, Sel
ma and Spring Hill, and many distant
points, came to attend his funeral.

We Must Maintain Roads as Well as
Build Them.
In many a country in the South
the condition of the roads is the
same as those which the editor
of the Clinton Drnocrat de
scribes as existing in his coun
try. He says:
"We can't survive the impres
sion that we have wasted a lot
of money; that we have built a
lot of roads that have gone back
to their former condition, from
neglect; that we have burdened
our posterity with a debt that
has proved to be a rather bad
investment. We have burdened
our children with bonds that will
be mighty hard to pay, and we
will have to answer for a great
deal, if for their $150,000 we
leave them a legacy of mudholes,
a heritage of sand and water.
One of the main defects in our
present program, we think, is
the fact that we are spending all
of our money on construction and
are not taking proper thought
for the maintenance of roads."
