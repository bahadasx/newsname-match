the fire was virtually under control. (
Officers and members of the frelgh- I
ter's crew said that so. far as Ihey I
knew, no explosion preceded the fire, t
but they were unable to offer an ex- i
Planatlon of how the blase originated f
In a hold which they said contained ! s
only structural steel and railway material.
When asked if there was any
evidence Indicating the fire had been 1
of incendiary origin, the officers said
"that it was too soon to make an Investigation"
and declined to comment
on the unusual features of the
blaze.
The Synaga will be docked, partly
unloaded and thoroughly examined to
determine the cause of the blaze.
Steel rails and various forms of struc- /
tural steel were said to be in the j
bottom of the forehold, while on top'
of this material was a large amount!
of railway supplies, chiefly steel car!
Parts. for assembling in Russia. It
could not be learned whether the vessel
had any munitions on board. ^

whose crown of silvery hair, clear cut b
