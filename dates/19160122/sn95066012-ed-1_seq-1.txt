THE CROSS STATE ROAD
Meeting of Committees Held Wednes
day at Wilmington.
t
Owing to the crippled condition of
the Banner staff and composing room
force due to illness much valuable
matter has been omitted from the pa
per the past few days. One of these
important matters was the meeting
at Wilmington Wednesday of the
Board of Trade committees from Ben
nington, Brattleboro, Wilmington and
Bellows Falls to further the plan for
the improvement of tho highway be
tween Bennington and Brattleboro.
The following is from the Brattleboro
Keformer account of the meeting:
The meeting in Wilmington of men
from Brattleboro, Bennington, Wil
mington, Marlboro and Woodford
who are determined that a better
highway shall be provided across the
state between Bennington and Brat
tleboro gave vent to a lot of enthus
iasm and convinced everyone present
that his determination was backed
by that of every otherk man who was
there and by many others in southern
Vermont whose ; representatives they
wereV : . ' j ' .
The meeting of the General com
mittee, "composed of ynai from the
several towns mentioned, created
such enthusiasm that the suggestion
was made by Frank E. Hftwe of Ben
ningon that the .committee remain
until evening and help oufc at a meet
ing of Wilmington men. This was
done and when the Brattleboro con
tingent left for home at 9 o'clock it
was evident that the town of, Wil
mington purposed to do its share
towards having an Improved highway
across the state.
It was the sense of the general
meeting that the best way to accom
plish the end was for each delegation
to work for a special appropriation
in the respective towns. It was voted
to appoint an executive corumitteo
from the different towns and lk. L.
Bates of Bennington was ejected
chairman. He appointed the fallow
ing committee: T 1
Frank E. Howe of Bennington; j E.
P. Adams of Marlboro, D. M. Gloason
of Woodford, llorlon D. Walkeriof
Brattleboro, T. E. O'Brien of BelloVa
Falls, Andrew Davis of Searsbujg
and M, E. Lyman of Wilmington.
This committee is expected to bo the
effective means of developing pro
gress. Jt.l.s, the ways and means
committee that will worfc" but the "best
way to further the general plan.
' u Those present yesterday as dele
gates from the several towns were
Judge T. E, O'Brien of Bellows Falls,
Judgtf E. L. Bates. President W. t(.
Nichols of the Bennington bourd"of
trade, Frank E. Howe and E!'D.
Moore ol' Bennington; W. E. Snow' mt
Marlboro; Dr. L. ,T Page, C B ('Kel
land, secretary of the Wilmington
board of trade, M. 15. Lyman, U. M.
Leonard, Hoy Courtemarche, Floyd
S. Crafts and Selectman A. D. Howe
of Wilmington; County Highway Com
missioner David T. Perry, Road Com
missioner Warren L. Walker, Select
man, W. E. Stellnmn, John B. Mauley,
Kenneth E. Mosher, President Horton
D. Walker and Secretary Carl S. Hop
kins of the Brattleboro board of trade
of Brattleboro.
Those who spoke Included Mr.
Howe, President Walker, Judge
O'Brien. Commissioner Perry, Dr.
Page and President Nichols. Mr.
Walker in his t;ili; gave Uie recently
published figures of the. ost of the
liullding of the famous Mohawk Trail
over the Hoosac mountains as $400,
000: He urged, as did bthers who
spoke, that it is time-to capitalize the
natural picture gallery. bf Vermont,
Thousands' come to the state every
Buriimer and fall, drawn" by its beauty
ami grandeur, 'and thousands more
would come and 'reihaln longer and
travel1 farther' if the roads permitted
comfortable travel :by modern means.
The best investment, all admitted, is
good roads.
Speaking of the ways and means
for a better highway between Brattle
boro and Bennington Mr. Walker said
he had never been able to extract a
promise from State Highway Commis
sioner Stoddard L. Bates, but he had
extracted an intimation that if Brat
tleboro and Bennington would build
to their town lines the kind of a road
they would like to have across the
mountain, ho would see to it that the
intermediate towns were helped to
keep up the standard "if they want
to." This expression he interpreted
to mean if these towns express the de
sire by voting money in town meet
ings for state work.
Every one of those who spoke
echoed the sentiments of Mr. Walker
and there followed a general discus
sion of ways and means, resulting
finally in the appointment of the ex
ecutive committee. There was con
siderable discussion over a name, one
or ! two objecting to the proposition
of "Ethan Allen Trail" as a borrowed
name so far as"trail" is concerned,
Other names suggested were "Ethan
Allen View" and "Green Mountain
Post Road."
Following a suggestion iby Mr.
Howe everyono voted to remain over
und help nt the evening meeting of
citizens of Wilmington. This wns

London, Jan. 21. Fog. on the lower

"We thought this would be a short

HOW CITY PLANNING
MAY BE STARTED.
A Citizen May InitiaU the Idea and a
ermanerrt Organization Follow.
.tf
i
Often a single public spirited citizen
w'jih veryflittio expenditure of effort
i u initiate a city planning movement,
ays I'ruirk Koester. At on Informal
Uinner tb subject may be brought up
uut the 'iirst steps taken that Is, to
Interest ja few men of prominence lit
the idea. A committee may then be
Judiciously selected of those who are
williugsto leud the weight of their
names to the undertaking.
A permanent organization of some
size itt.then formed, which may be
known as the Civic Iiuproverneut or
City: Pu"'";? association. It should
be repiescn ta live of the most promi
nent mumliers of the different profes
sions an should include in its 'mem
bership "heading business men, bankers,
lawyer,?, f ditors, clergymen, architects,
engineers, -painters, sculptors, educa
tors, rejhusentutives of various public
welfare societies, the mayor' of the
city, eommlksioneis of public works
and perhaps also leading representa
tives of outlying communities. The
newspuicrs will, of course, have becu
Interested in the movemeut from the
outset
The first step is to raise a fund for
purposes of securing plans and meet
ing the expense of the movement, and
this may be accomplished either by au
appropriation made by the municipal
authorities, by donation from a philan
thropist or by a general public sub
scription. ,It advisable to, have us
great n genoi-at interest as possible
created in the -nubject, as it will thus
receive n desree of support- which
would not be nw-ordetl it were its ac
tivities confiiied'to u limited number,,
One of the next meuhs of arousing
public Interest in. city planning is the
giving of public; lectures (jit the .sub-Jis-t
by experts. Sftcli lecturer should
always be obtained whatever the plan
followed, and the-. -lecture NhouUlJie. ac
companied by illustrations of what has
been done and Is conlemplnted in other
cities. . , . - . ,
When the work of the expert has
been completed a public exhibition
should lie held of the drawings nad
plans, and they should be subjected to
the criticism of the public at large aud
discussed in public meetings and iu
(he press.
