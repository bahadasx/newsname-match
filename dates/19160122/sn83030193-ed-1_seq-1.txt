ranged beforehand that each member
of tho committee should keep his own

the State Cpmptrollcr.
"t cannot recall offhand all tle

the pro-rating practlco wns followe.I,

from tlmo Immemorial. In this

hai been more economy and restraint
practiced than customary. Not a
bottle of wine has been charged by
any member to the Stale, nor so far
as I know has a bottle of wlno been
drank by uny of them. Kven tho New

were In town was paid for out of
their own pockets.
"However much the practice may
be criticized, the fact lemalns that

In former years the practlco was to
put down on the bills first the names
of all the members and then lump all

years ago somo Comptroller demand

The beauty ot a six-year-old child
and tho warmth ot a woman's heart,

Gcorgo II. Gould, whose husband Is a
retired merchant, of No. iC West Sixty-ninth
Street, and rich, and the
others arc Mr. and Mrs. Henri de
Rudder, musicians,
lleforo tho war began do Rudder
was orchestra leader at the Antwerp
Opera. ,'lut the Gcunan shells
knocked tho opera houso to pieces, and
tho do Rudders, who tho day before
had money and u home, fled with tho
other refugees. After a while they
landed In Now York with no money,
only the violin and tho cello.
"Well." said Mr. do Rudder, "It
seems to me, my dear, that as I can
get no work, thcro Is only one way
out ot It. All tho evening up nnd
down this busy Uroadwuy go tho peo
ple. Wo will play for thetu, and tho
little one shall Invito them to give
something. It la not tho opera, but
It la honest, and ono must live."
That Is how it c.uno about that Mrs.
Gould, passing Broadway nnd Hlx
tleth Street In ono of her lulf-dozon
automobiles, heard tho musiu and saw
tho child pushing around a toy cart.
Into which a few Now Yorkers wero
tossfng a very few small colnj.
Mrs. Gould got out and stroked tho
little girl's hair. That evening sho
had tho whole do Iluddcr family to
dinner, and heard their story. Tho
next thing was tho Installation ot the
do Rudders In a modest llttlu homo
at No. 7C3 Columbus Avenue, Hut
Mrs. Gould still wasn't sure exactly
how far to follow with her good In
tentions. Tho do Rudders kept on giving their
street corner concerts until late yes
terday when two agents of tho
Children's Society arrested tho three
and took them to tho West forty
seventh Streot Station. Mrs. Gould
might never havo heard about It had
not she gnno to the dc Rudders's
bumu with a big doll for the llttlo girl.

Arraigned before Maglstrato
Groohl, do Rudder was telling Ills
story when Agent Sherwood whis
pered to the Court that Mrs. Gould
had como to tho rotcue and would
assuro tho Maglstrnto that tho fam
ily should no longer want.
"I was Btruck by tho child's
beauty," explained Mrs. Gould.
Do Rudder was asked whether Mrs.
Gould proposed to adopt tho child.
"Sho wants her," ho said. "Sho will
got mo a Job now in an orchestra.
In a year I go back to Llclgluin in

Mrs. Gould doesn't think tho do
Rudders will give up the llttlo girl.
"They Idolize her." bho explained.
"She's a ray of sunshine to thus-i
poor people In their distress. I bo
llove it was for this reason they
would not accept my offer to lake tho
child Into my own home They would
be miserable without her."

Chief Worth suggested that Capt.

aground In tho mud oft 'i'.nnpkinsvllle
so the light could be carried on In

because ho said his Largo was so
heavy ho feared It would burst

rested on bottom. A wn'i'kiiig crane
was sent down and tho heavy ma
terial on tho decks sliit'tnl -o that the
