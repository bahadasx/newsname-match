HOW WARRING POWERS BUILT WALL OF " ?
STEEL CUTTING OFF GREECE FROM WORLD
IN ABJECT WANT
Appeal for Aid'Made on Be
Thursday of next week, January 27,
has been set aside by President Wil
son as the day for the people of the
United States to contribute to the fund
that is being raised to alleviate the
sufferings of the Jews in the war
stricken countries of Europe. The Gov
ernors of some of the states have fol
lowed the President's example and
there is every indication that there
will be a generous response to the ap
peal all over the Uttltqfl States. -
This is the first time in the history
of the Jewish nation that her people
have asked those of other creeds for
succor. No matter how much In need
of aid or support in the times that
have passed, they have found their
strength has bsen sufficient to care
for those in distress But the existing
situation is without precedent in its
magnitude, and although the Jows
have contributed generously, they
have been compelled to make a gen
eral appeal.
There are suffering Jows in every
theatre of war. It has been convinc
ingly established that there are 9,000,
000 Jews in the countries now'involved
in the great w?r, and that the major
ity of these people through no fault
of their own, are homeless, without
food, shelter or clothing, and that,
therefore they are In such immediate
need of relief that it behooves all
good citizens to hear this cry of hu
man suffering and distress.
It is the hope that at least $500 will
be realized in Fairmont. There is con
siderable interest shown in this mat
ter locally. On Sunday morning the
pastors and recorts of the local
churchec will announce to'their con*
gregations the fact that Thursday has
been set aside as Jewish Relief Day.
Those who desire to contribute to
this aid may send their contributions
either to the Times for the' Jewish
Belief fund, or to Simon D. Goodman,
field director of the Jewish Belief
fund, of this city.

a frantic elephant Is related In a suit
for $20,000 damages brought by Mrs.

salt is that Mrs. Oee alleges the zo
ological society" used the elephant as
a ,'common carrier" for carrying pas
sengers for pay. She charged it was
the duty of tho society to provide her
with a safe place to ride on, and that
the elephant should have been docile.
Instead, she said,* she was sitting on
his back when the animal began to
run around tho enclosure and then
made a dash, for the doorway Into the
elephant house. Employes of the park
calld to her to jump off his back, and
she did so Just In time to dodge the

through the doorway. In the fall she
avers she suffered injuries for which
she seeks $20,000.
