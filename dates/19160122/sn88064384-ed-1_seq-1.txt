AFTER SEARCHING HE EAR
fcor better stylus material, a Victor expert discovered the
miraculous reproducing and wearing qualities of tungsten
The Tungs-tone Stylus will play from fifty to two
hundred records or even more.
The life of the Tungs-tone Stylus depends on the
character and volume of the records played.
You don't have to change the Tungs-tone Stylus until
it wears out. When this takes place the stylus simply
stops reproducing as a signal for a new one. There is n<>
danger of spoiling the record, because, strange to say,
tungsten is softer than the record, although its wearing
quality is one to two hundred per cent, better than the
hardest steel. We cannot explain why—it is one of na
ture'e secrets—a phenomenon. We o :ly know it is true
and recommend the Tungs-tone Stylus to all Victor users.
No needles to change is the chief nostrum of manufac
turers of machines operated with a permanent jewel point,
but the
VICTOR COMPANY
knows what others will learn in time, namely: that no per
manent point can be made to la-d forever on hard disc
records. The jewel stylus was a success on the old wax
jcylinder records, but jewels do wear rough in time, and, if
not instantly detected and changed, will quickly spoil a
valuable collection of records—a most insidious danger;
hence the Victor Steel Needle, to be used but once, was the
only practical needle for the new gramophone type of hard
record until the discovery of the miraculous properties oi
tungsten for reproducing styli.
Tungs-tone is a trade name and was coined for the
occasion.
The new Tungs-tone Stylus is made in soft tone as
well as in full tone, and can be changed instantly, just the
same as a steel needle.
The virtue of the Tungs-tone Stylus lies in a small
cylinder of tungsten projecting from the t ud of a steel
holder in which it is rigidly set.
The tiny cylinders of tungsten reproduce Victor
Records better than any known material.
Smooth, strong and full as to tone.
The Victor Tungs-tone Stylusfits all Victorsouud boxes.
