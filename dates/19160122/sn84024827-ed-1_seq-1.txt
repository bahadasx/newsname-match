TO ESCAPE
American Residents of the
Country Near Santa Ysabel,
Chihuahua, Has Harrowing
Times with Bandits.
To be farmed by a friendly member
of a bandit gang, thought connected
with that which perpetrated the Am
erican massacre at Santa Ysabel on
January 10, and to ride eighty miles
over the mountains, from .his, cattle ,
ranch af EI Fortosi to Chihuahua,' was
the interesting, not to say terrifying
experience of A. C. Dudley.
Dudley, who has resided in the state
of Chihuahua off and on for the past
fifteen years, was an extensive cattle-
rancher and dealer.
Some years ago
he gave the son of one of his old
ployes a 30-40 Winchester rifle and did
the young man some other favors,
On the late afternoon of January 10,
presumably a short while after the
massacre of the Americans at Santa
Ysabel, which is but a few miles from
El Portosi, the young Mexican appear -
ed a the ranch of the American. He
warned Dudley that the bandit gang,
of which he was a member, was on its
way to the ranch and would murder
every American found. The , Mexican
explained that he had left the gang
and had ridden by a trail, with which
he was familiar, across the mountain
to the ranch and would, afterwards,
rejoin his crowd from the rear by an
other short cut. .
Leaving everything as it stood on
his ranch, Dudley saddled his best
horse and started for the city of Chi-;
huahua. He arrived there sometima!
after eight o'clock the next morning
after an all-night ride.
The first news he was acquainted
with was that of the murder of nine
teen Americans a short distance from
his own ranch. While in Chihuahua
he saw the bodies of the victims ar
rive from the branch line on which the
tragedy occurred.
According to the American there are
very few Americans, comparatively
speaking, in the state of Chihuahua at
the present time. Most of them have
either been driven from their property
or came out of their own volition, fear
ing bandits.
Mexico Unsettled.
Mexico Is more, unsettled oday, de-
clared! Dudley, than It has been in the1;
past ten years, not excepting the times '
of the various and sundry revolutions
t
"It is myopinion," said the refugee.
'that the revolution is far from over.
Carranza is not a favorite with
people of any class in Mexico and I
am afraid he can never hold his organ-
izRtion together.
."Reports from the Interior, since my
return to the United States, to the'ef
feot that Obregon was arrested is
proof of the truth of the feeling that
