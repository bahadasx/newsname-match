Let us compare it with the hap
pening! of i little more than a
century ago In France.
The French revolution was t! p
biggest happening of modern
times, and took place nbo.it the
same time as the American re
solution, The Americans fought
tn free themselves from a roreign
despot, while the French fought
to overthrow the despots within
the church and the state. Con
i ernlng the beginning of the
French revolution, the following

It was an almost universal
feeling, that the old system was
doomed. Things could not go on
aa they were. A change was
needed. Travelers. passing
through France, had described
the wretched condition of ihe
peasantry. Hooks had heen pub
lished attacking the Divine Right
,f hoivdttnr.v kings. Plays had
been stuped and acted. amid
thunder or applause, in which the
outrageous special privileges of
the nobles were satyrlied and
held up to public hatred. Philos
ophers had toiled mightily, to

allowed to take for his own use
on his own place, a bare, a quail,
or a dove, and he was not nt lib
erty to hoe or manure his crops,
at certain seasons, lest the out
ting of the weeds might disturb
the young covles of quail, and the
manure might injure their flavor 1
The peasant was c onsc ripted, to
build the public roads: and he
was called upon, a certain num
ber of duys each .rear, to do un
paid labor for his land-lord ; ami
hie land-lord required or him to
letch his wheat to the lord's mill,
his grapes to the lord's wine

the American war lor independ

opportunity to do England an
evil turn in retaliation for the
losses England had inflicted upon
France, in India, in Canada, and
the North-western portion or Col
onial America
The French statesmen received
American envoys, and began
through underground channels to
advance money to aid the Colo
nies. Young Frenchmen came
over In shoals to enlist In the A
merican army. To most or these
it was an adventure; to LaFay
etts and a few others, it was a
principle. It was Inevitable that

town; and all the gallant French
officers came hurrying home, to
fidht their battles over again; It
was inevitable. I say that a new
spirit should begin to brood upon
the ast. dark waters or the un
natural Old Order.
Almost before anyone knew of
the impending change, the ohangc
was manifest. The tone or con

of the ocean of thought, but had
disturbed the deeps, a vague as

Versailles Tnrk. a rustic mill,

daughter of the Ceasars .played
at being a fanner's wife, and sold

Her brother, the Emperor of Aus
tra, was a trenchant reformer,
who compelled the Pope to eat
humble pie and crouch at Canoso ;
but when he came on a visit to
Paris, and listened to the Demo
cratic talk and witnessed the
freakish rusticity ol his sister, he
shook his head and said. My
trade is to lie a king. "
Madly extravagant herself, the
giddy young Queen surrounded
herself with insatiable sycophants
who used their influence with her
to empty the treasury of France.
The desperate Minister turned
to the Nobles, and Implored them
to yield their exemption from the
burdens of 8tate. He was an

The Minister pleaded with the
clergy, beseeching them to waive

"Why. that's a revolt!' cried
the King, when aroused from
sleep by the lluke of LalllCOUft to
hear the doomful tidings,
"No. sir. it is a Revolution,"
gravely answered the Puke:
The fall or the Pastille was
heard all around the world; and
it Was Significant that one of the
keys of the ancient Bourbon fort
ress should have been sent to
3eorge Washington. Royalist
and Romanist writers tell you
that few prisoners were found In
the cells: what they do not tell
you is. that the free-thinking and
good-hearted Regent who gov
erned France during the minori
ty of Louis the XV. had opened
the doors, and offered freedom to
all the captives, -One of these
had been confined Tor thirty-rive
years, and the most diligent in
qulry railed to learn what the
man had been imprisoned for, or
by whom. Arriving from Italy,
he had been clapped into the Bas
tille, and forgotten. Offered his
liberty, the poor creature asked
t" be permitted to remain In Jail
His life had been spent, Ists fami
ly scattered, his home lost
what could the okl w reck do
with his ri eedom?
Another thing the Royalis g
the Romanists forget to tell yous
at the spiteful institution of the
King's scarlet woman. Madam de
Pompadour, a harmless poet. La
tude. was Imprisoned for Hie. bis
'rime being an epigram which
stung royalty's harlot.
Such was the system: blazing
with the splendors of unearned
wealth at the top; smouldering
with the Intense dissatisfaction
of the pillaged producers, at the
bottom.
