McColl Denies Reports That Prisoners

Des Moines, Jan. 22.—A. iM. McColl,
member of the state board of control,
today denied that the recent disorders
among the prisoners at the Anamosa
reformatory were due to the failure of
the state to order dental work for a
convict named O'Toole.
"The board in December purchased
a -complete dental outfit for the re
formatory and authorized the employ
ment of a dentist at a salary of $1,500
a year," said Mr. McColl. "For some
reason the warden has not yet: em
ployed the dentist, but in the meantime
dental work of the prisoners is being
done by dentists at Anamosa. O'Toole

tended to."

had been turned into
Sygna's fore hold, from which clouds
of smoke were pouring when she
reached port, it was believed the fire
was virtually under control.
Officers and members of the freight
er's crew said that, so far as they
knew, no explosion preceded the fire,
but they were unable to offer an ex
planation of how the blaze originated
in a hold which they said contained
only structural steel and railway ma
terial. When asked if there was evi
dence indicating that the fire had been
of incendiary origin, the officers said
"that it was too soon to make an in

No Fire When Ship Sailed.
Members of the Sygna's drew, who
covered the hatch of the forehold yes

fire when the freighter sailed and that
it was early yesterday evening before
one of the watch saw smoke seeping
from around the hatch. The cover was
hurriedly taken off and while no flames
could be seen, a great quantity of smoko
rose from the hold.

BANDIT KILLS POLICEMAN.
Robbery and Murder in Heart of Chi
cago Business District.
Chicago, Jan. 22.—A bandit, accom
panied by a woman, Friday afternoon
robbed the tourist agency of Thomas,
A. Cook & Son of $800, wounded the
cashier, killed a policeman and es
caped.
According to the poHc© the aeea
Was the most dating of years in this
'city. It was accomplished on one ot
the busiest streets of die downtown
district at an' hour when the thoro
fare was congested with automobiles
and workers on their way home.
The woman did not participate in
•the actual robb'ery. Sfce ordered a
taxicab at the Great Northern Hotel
thru the doorman, and John MoCabe
of'the Fay Company responded. The
woman Instructed him to drive to 15
Bast Jackson street, the Cook offices.
There she waited without alighting.
Meanwhile the robber had entered the
offices. The cashier, Ernest L. Walsh,
attempted to Teach a revolver, but
was shot and painfully injured and
backed into a vault with four other
employes. B. A. Johnson, a traffic po
liceman, was attracted to the scene
but found" that the bandit had locked
the door after entering. Johnson #as
trying to force an entrance when the
robber suddenly threw it open and
fired a bullet into the officer's heart.
The bandit scattered the throng on
the sidewalk and elaped toward the
taxicab. He pointed his weapon at
McCabe and ordered him to drive
away, but McCabe Jumped. The bandit
hesitated a second, and then spend up
an alley. The woman followed. She
gazed a moment at the dead police
man, and according to witnesses,
seemed about to faint, 'but recovered
and disappeared in the crowd. McCabe
was interviewed at police headquar
ters and allowed to ret,urn to work.
The police were satisfied 6t his inno
cence.
Police believe the robbery was care
fully planned, but was weak In. one
point. The fact that the chauffeur de
clined to start the motor, it was said,
probably saved the fugitive from, cap
ture. Officers declare that the taxicab
could not have gone very far even if
tha imotor had been started, because
of the extreme congestion/of the traf
fic on Jackson street at, that hour of
the day.
The police early today had no clue as
to the whereabouts of the man who
killed Johnson.
The woman accomplice escaped with
the robber and is thought to faaVe

will have "a municipal court and do
away With the present justice court
system. The supreme court ruled to
day that the municipal court. bill was
legally adopted In the recent election.
By this ruling the court also upholds
the legality of the street car franchise
election.
1
Municipal judges will be elected next
spring, at the same time as the city
councilmen The street or franchise
probably will be accepted by the com
pany, and six fares for a quarter will
go into effect early next week.
Women's Vote Legal.
The principal point in the case just
decided was whether women were le
gally entitled to vote in the election. It
was the vote of the women which gave
the proposition a bare majority. The
franchise of the street car company
•was affected by a point raised in re
gard to the legality of the registration
for the special election. This election
was held Nov. 29 last and almost im
mediately afterward a petition to re
strain certifloaition by the canvassing
board was filed before District Judge
Hubert Utterfcpwk by J, F. Anderson
and F, J. Younkers, local tax payers.
Vf••'••y. Five Points at Issue.
Five points were at issue in the case,
all directed to the alleged invalidity of
the special election. These points were:
First, that voting machines were re
quired to be used at such special elec
tion second, that the election was ln»
valid for the reason that no booth*
were provided and that therefore there
was no secret ballot third, that women
were not entitled to vote at such an
election fourth, that the office of jus
tice of the peace Is a constitutional of
fice and can ntfl be abolished by act of
the legislature fifth, that the voters
who voted at said election were not
properly registered and that the entire
election was Illegal and void.
Special stress was laid 'upon the
questions of women voting and of reg
istration. The proposition was carried
in the November election by a maJoritS"
of only fifty-six votes and the ballots of
women were necessary to make up this
majority. Judge Utterback ruled
against the petitioners on al the points
they raised. He declared that women
had a right to vote because the munic
ipal court question involved the rais
ing of additional revenue froift taxes.
Case Unique in Court Records.
Judge Utterback decided against the
petitioners, who appealed.
The case is said to have established
an unique record in litigation before
Iowa courts. In less than two months
from the date^ef^the election- the con
troversy has been finally adjudicated
by the highest court in the state.

ROOT ENDORSES^
GARRISON'S PLAN
Deolares National Guard Can Not Be
Developed Into Adequate Army For
National Defense—Would Start With
Adequate Tho Small Regular Army.
Washington, Jan. 22.—A letter on
"military conditions" by EUhu Root,
former secretary of state, and an ad
dress endorsing the administration's
continental army plan by**Henry L.
Stimson, former secretary-™oft war,
were features of the program of the
final session today of the National
Security League's conference. A num
ber of other addresses are also to be
delivered.
The conference will close tonight
with a banquet at which Senator
Lodge and former Attorney General
Wlckersham were to be the principal
speakers.
Senator Root's letter endorsed Sec
retary Garrison's contention that the
national guard could not be dependeu
upon for the army increase.
"It is idle," wrote Mr. Root, "to talk
of developing the national guard it
self into an adequate army for na
tional defense and any such attempt
would result in the failure of the whole
movement and the waste of all the
energy and effort devoted to it. The
national guard Is for state purposes.
There are good things In Secretary
Garrison's plan. The doing of them
would be progress In the right direc
tion, but In the meantime let us take
the first steps on any sort a program
that is directed toward a trained na
