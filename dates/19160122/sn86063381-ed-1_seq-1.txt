Tanner and Warfield Star.
This was the first game for Bemidji
with a Sixth district team and was
the first step toward repeating the
victory of last year.
Tanner and Warfield at forwards
were the stars for the Bemidji team
and their basket shooting was easily
the feature of the contest. The
former last night showed flashes of
speed and basket shooting which last
year won for him a place as forward
on the all-state high school team.
With fanner playing in old-time
form and the return of Johnson in
to the game, the Bemidji institution
will be represented by two of the most
brilliant performers of the net game
in the Northwest. The work of
Warfield last evening was also a
bright feature, he securing seven
field baskets and played a star game
both on the offense and defense. He
alternated at playing center and left
forward.
Players Are Shifted.
There was considerable shifting of
players so as to give all the substi

WAR MAZES MILLIONAIRES
Scandinavian countries are
having big war booms Nor
way getting lion's share of
war business see their
chance and grab it, making
much money.
By Chas. P. Stewart.
(Valted AIM Staff eonMqoiMUmt
Copenhagen, Jan. 6,r(By mail.)
Scandinavia is enjoying a tremendous
war boom. It is more or less com
mon to Sweden, Denmark and Nor
way, but so far as appearances go, it
is most pronounced, in Norway.
Sweden has sold to the belligerents,
especially to Germany, immense
amounts of raw and finished prod
ucts, including war munitions, though
these latter sales were not counten
anced by the Swediah government.
Denmark, being sepa&ted from Ger
many only by an imaginary line in
stead of a stretch of mined and dan
gerous water, has done still better.
The lion's share of the war business,
however, has gone to Norway.
Third Maritine Nation.
The Norwegians have profited to
some extent, like Sweden and Den
mark, by sales of their own goods
to the belligerent nations, especially
to Germany, but it has been as mid
dlemen that the bulk of their busi
ness has been done. Norway was the
world's third maritine nation when
the war broke out. England ranked
first, Germany second. England still
ranks first but even the British mer
cantile marine has suffered heavily
from the destruction incidental to
war. Germany'^3 merchant shipping
has been out of commission alto
gether since the early days of hostili
ties. This was Norway's chance.
America's Boom Small.
Compared with Norway, America's
war boom has been a small affair.
This is speaking relatively, of course.
In actual dollars and cents the Euro
pean struggle unquestionably has
brought more money to the United
States than to any other country.
Comparatively Norway has been the
big gainer. That is, the Norwegians
are richer by the struggle to the ex
tent of about $200,000,000 in actual
cash thus far. To properties they
already owned there has been added
a value of approximately as much
more. This is on a basis of a popu
lation of 2,500,000.
^^erease $80 Per Capita.
An addition of $80 per capita to
Norway's wealth in a year and a half
has been felt emphatically. It has
meant a boom such as the old world
has not seen hitherto in historic
times. Millionaires have been cre
ated wholesale. Many of them are
millionaires only in kronera krona
being in the neighborhood of 27
centsbut a jump from nothing, in
18 months, to a fortune of $250,-
000 to $270,000, which has happened
in hundreds of cases, is not so bad.
The big old shipping firms have pro
fited in actual millions of dollars. The
newly made millionaires in Norweg
ian money are mainly more clerks in
shopping houses, or working officers
of ocean-going craft who were able to
command a little credit and branched
out in business for themselves.
Never Owned Ships.
Numbers of the newly-made mag
nates have never owned a ship. They
have bought vessels in course of con
struction or invested merely in char
ters and have been able to transfer
either their unfinished craft or their
charters, so rapid was the increase
in the demand for bottoms at huge
advances, sometimes in the course of
no more than a few days. War taxes
have been high, but profits have been
so much higher that the taxes have
hardly been felt. The Norwegians

Some Men Don't Want Very Much
BEMIDJI SCHOOLS
ARECBOWDED, SAYS
SCHOOL INSPECTOR
E. M. Phillips, Representing State,
Examines Local
Conditions.
SYSTEM IN CITY IS
COMMENDED AS GOOD
Teachers Are Overworked on Ao
count of Number of Students
and Conditions.
That the Bemidji schools are over
crowded, but were in excellent con
dition and were being conducted in
an up-to-date manner, is the opinion
of E. M. Phillips, state high school
examiner, who yesterday examined
the Bemidji schools.
Are Very Crowded.
In speaking of the situation to the
Pioneer, Mr. Phillips said: "There
is but one thing that might be em
phasized in regard to the Bemidji
schools and that is that they are in
a crowded condition. In fact, they
are more crowded than parents can
imagine.
Taxed to Full Capacity.
"In the North School I found that
although it was not what one would
call crowded, it was taxed to its full
capacity. To put more students in
that building would mean to put
students at a disadvantage and over
work he teachers.
Teachers Overworked.
"The high school building is some
what crowded since the proper fa
cilities for enlarging the industrial
and practical branches have been
shut off. The Congestion there at
present has not permitted extension
along certain needy lines. Some of
the teachers are overworked and
have too many students to do justice
to all of them.
"The Central school is overly
crowded, more so than any other
school in the city."
Mr. Phillips met with the teachers
at the high school yesterday after
noon and in a talk with them stated
that he found the schools here con
ducted in an up-to-date manner. Mr.
Phillips met with the- school-board
last evening.
ODD FELLOWS HAVE
BIG INITIATION
About 80 members bf the Odd
Fellows lodge attended the initiation
ceremonies of that lodge last eve
ning. Eleven new members were
initiated. Delegations of Odd Fel
lows were present from Akeley, Bag
ley, Tenstrike and other points.
After the ceremonies a banquet was
given the members by the ladies of
the Rebecca lodge at the Presbyter
ian church. F. B. Lamson presided
as toastmaster. A. L. Bolton, grand
secretary, of St. Paul, delivered an
address.
A smoker was given after the ban
quet at which R. L. Given gave the
history of the local order and S.
Jenkinson, a charter member of the
organization, gave a short talk. Au
gust Jarchow, who is a member of
the first lodge in the state, Stillwater
Lodge No. 1, gave a talk. B. W.
Noble of Nebish announced that a
lodge would probably be formed in
Nebish this spring.
LAD NARROWLY ESCAPES
DEATH TRAIN HITS SLED
Roy Olson, the six-year-old son of
H. Olson of Mill Park, narrowly es
caped death late yesterday afternoon
when the Soo passenger train struck
the sled upon which the boy was
sliding down the hill which crosses
the Soo tracks in Mill Park. Roy
started to coast down the hill and
did not see the approaching train!
When he was about half way down
the hill he saw the train and rolled
off the sled. The engine struck the
sled and broke it into splinters.
A BANKER'S ADVICE TO A
HOUSEWIFE OP ECONOMY
Cleveland, O., Jan. 22."If
every family saved one match
a day, the United States
would be ahead $500,000 a
year," today said F. D. Con
ner, president of one of the
biggest financial institutions
here. Conner believes every
housewife should be paid a
weekly wage to prevent fam
ily squabbles and that every
wife should prevent food
waste. He claims fortunes in
food are thrown into gar
bage cans. The banker be
lieves bills should be paid by
check and a stipulated
amount saved weekly.
MINNESOTA GETS
MANY CARS OF
M0VABLESIN1915
Fred D. Sherman, Commissioner of
Immigration, Compiles
Figures.
FAIR MOVEMENT IS
EXPECTED IN SPRING
Fertility of State's Soil, Low Price
of Land Attracts Many
Homeseekers.
St. Paul, Minn., Jan. 22. (Spe
cial to the Pioneer.)Figures com
piled and given out by Fred D. Sher
man, commissioner of immigration,
show that during the past year of
1915, there were exactly 4,444 cars
of immigrant movables handled by
the Minnesota Transfer Railway
company of which Minnesota received
2,306 cars and the balance going to
other states. This gives Minnesota
a percentage of about 51 per cent
of the total number handled. Of the
Northwestern states, which are in
competition with Minnesota for im
migration are as follows: North
Dakota, Wisconsin, Montana, Can
ada, South Dakota and Washington.
The nearest competitor to Minnesota
last year in the way of receiving im
migrant movables was North Da
kota, who received 648 cars Wiscon
sin came next with 502 cars Mon
tana 360, Canada 168, South Dakota
163 and Washington 37.
Increase Ten Per Cent.
While there were more cars of
immigrant movables handled by this
railway company in 1914, Minne
sota has increased her percentage
about 10 per cent, as records for
the year of 1914 show that 5,277 cars
were handled, of which Minnesota
received 2,350 and the remaining 2,-
927 went to other states, but the
proportion of receipts in other states
vary somewhat. For instance: Can
ada in 1914 received 825 cars while
in 1915 she received only 168 cars.
Montana in 1914 received 635 cars
and in 1915, 360 cars. The balance
of the states received about the
same proportion both years.
Not as Bright.
"Prospects for immigration this
year are not as bright as I would
like to see them," said Commissioner
Sherman, "but notwithstanding this,
I look for a fair movement to the
Northwest when the spring opens and
I have no fear but what Minnesota
will maintain her present percentage
of receiving at least as much, if not
more, than all the other competing
states combined. The fertility of
Minnesota's soil, the low price of
her lands, coupled with many other
advantages, it is becoming pretty
thoroughly known throughout the
states of Iowa, Illinois and Indiana
and we are bound to receive the bulk
of immigration to the Northwest for
some years to come."
