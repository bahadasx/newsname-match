Jones Faction Wins
Decision' In Chicago Rendered This
week, Sustained the Contentions of
EE. P. Jones and Followers, Making
Them the National Baptist Conven
tion. Judge Smith Rendering De
cision. Chicago, January 10. A decision
Tendered In the courts of Chicago to
day by Judge Smith sustained the de
murrer of attorneys Walter SI. Farm
er of this city, and Wm. Harrison, of
Oklahoma City, recognizing the Na
tional Baptist Convention of which E.
P. Jones, D. D of VIcksburg. Miss.,
was elected president. It will be re
membered that during the month of
September last year the Baptists held
a convention In this city and divided
into two parts over a charter gotten
out by seven men. A majority of one
hundred fifty or more votes in the
Convention was against the charter,
whereupon. Dr. Morris and his fol
lowers left tlio chair and the Con
vention Immediately elected E. P.
Jones and an entirely new set of
officers. The Incorporated Conven
tion led bjr Dr. Morris got out an In
junction to prevent theJoHes people,
from using the name "National Bap
tist Convention." The case has been
hanging fire and the decision today by
the court Is far-reaching, as It tears
down and virtually eliminates the In
corporated faction as a national body.
The contest was sharp and prolonged.
Able counsel represented both sides,
bu( to tlie demurrer offered by the
attorneys for the Jones faction every
contention made and the Ave points
of law presented were upheld. Pres
ident Jones was reached by wire In
Philadelphia and expressed himself as
well pleased, declaring that he knew
the will of the Baptists would bo sus
tained. It is said that this decision
puts the Incorporated faction to rout.
It is learned that. President Jones will
call a meeting of his advisors, con
sisting of the chairmen and the sec
retaries of tho various Boards, to
gether with the elective officers to
meet in Nashville at an early date.
SCHOOL CARNIVAL REPORT OUT.
On account of the intervening of
the holidays soon after the big Con
vention hall school carnival, thus de
laying the reports from some of the
schools, the final statement relative
to the financial end of the affair is
Just now available.
As stated previously in these
columns tho attendance was disap
pointing. In most cases fathers re
mained away, the children being either
sent with tho mother or in quite a
number of cases alone.
Most of the advertising and advance
Bale of tickets was conducted .through
the schools, the charity workers hav
ing turned the whole responsibility
over to the children, apparently.
Following Is a condensed statement
of the finances:
Tickets sold by school children. $340.00
Tickets sold at door.; 145.25
Advance sale box seats 125.50
Total ,.$10.75
Deduct total expenses $234.77
Net proceeds $375.98
In the advance sale of tickets the
schools rank; as follows:
Lincoln High ...r $151.25
Wendell Phillips 83.00
Lincoln -77.00
Attucks . . , 71-25
Douglass . . 25,00
Garrison . 17.25
Bruce 12.00
Penn "-5Q
Wh'eatly 8-6Q
Blue Valley 3-50
Booker T. Washington 3.00
Sumner 2,25
As anticipated by the Sun, the su
pervisors, principals, teachers and
rhlldron covered themselves with
glory in working out this most bril
liant affair, but the above figures snow
that the end by no means Justified
tho Immense sacrifice of time and la
bor required. The schools are all far
behind on the year's schedule of work
unrt will not bo able to reach the
standard of . proficiency for tho year,
making annual promotions very uncertain.
Care of the Baby in Winter
(Prepared by the Children's Bureau,
U., S. Department of Labor )
So much emphasis Is constantly
placed upon the necessity for special
care of tho baby in summer, when
the heat is excessive and diarrheal
diseases at their worst, that the fact
that winter, too, has Its special dan
gers for the baby is sometimes over
looked. But the combination of heat and
diarrhea Is hardly more serious for the
baby In the months of July and Aug
ust, than "are colli and respiratory dis
eases In winter.
It Is plain then, that the winter care
of the baby deserves special attention
from everyone interested in his health
and well-being.
It has been demonstrated quite con
clusively that a large part of the
deaths from summer diarrhea are
needless,- because this disease may be
cured in many cases, and prevented
entirely In many more by the proper
care and feeding of the baby during
the heated months. The same doc
trine is now being applied to the
group of what are commonly called
"winter disease" of babies and chil
dren, namely, bronchitis, pneumonia,
"colds", and the like, which are, like
diarrhea, to a large extent, prevent
able by the intelligent care of the
baby, and by surrounding him with
proper living conditions.
These proper living' conditions con
sist both in winter and summer of
suitable food, in the right amounts,
at the right times, cleanliness, suffl
cient sleep, plenty of fresh, clean air
to breathe, and protection from expos
ure to infectious diseases. It Is chief
ly the lack of these two latter re
qulrements that causes the winter ill
nesses among babies.
It Is not the cold of. winter which
makes people sick, ordinarily, but
rather the stale over-heated air inside
our houses and public buildings
which we breathe and, re-breathe, thus
passing disease germs about from
one to another. Babies are partiC'
ularly liable to be Infected In this
way because they spend a large part
of their time indoors, and because
mothers are apt to feel that to keep
the baby warm the rooms must be
kept shut tight.
A mother should use every means
in her power to protect her baby from
'taking cold," as it is commonly de
scribed. VColds" are due- to a germ
and are very contagious, being easily
passed from one person to another In
coughing or sneezing. A nursing
mother with a cold should tie a thin
cloth or veil over her mouth and nose
while nursing the baby, and should
be careful never to cough or sneeze In
his face, nor kiss him on the mouth.
She should be particularly careful not
to use her own handkerchief for the
baby, nor sleep with him, while tho
disease lasts. Many babies contract
these colds by being taken up and
kissed by visitors, and it is a wise
rule to keep the baby away from
the presence of people who are
coughing and sneezing. The reason
for this great care as regards a baby
is that a contagious cold is very often
the forerunner of bronchitis and
pneumonia, which diseases cause the
deaths of many thousands of young
babies every year, and which are in
finitely easier to prevent than to cure.
Fresh air Is the mo3t effective
weapon with which to fight the dls
eases of the respiratory tract. This
does not necessarily mean cold air,
for cold air may be stale, and warm
air may be pure. The ventilation of
most American houses is faulty,
since in order to keep them warm
enough to suit us we shut them so
tightly as to make the air unfit to
breathe, after -a few hours. To
counteract this tendency mothers
should see to It that all the occupied
rooms of the bouse are thoroughly
aired at least twice every day hi the
coldest weather, while in moderate
weather there should bo as nearly
constant a supply of fresh air through
out the house, night and day, as can
be managed. '
When the temperature outside is
very low, the baby should be taken
into a warm room while his nursery
Is .being aired, and at night, bis bed
should be shielded from a direct
draft. If there is a communicating
room, the window in that room may
be opened, if there is danger of clilll
Ing the air of his sleeping room.
If the cold is excessive, or if there
is a raw, damp wind plowing or rain
or snow Is falling, the baby should be
given his' dally airing in a room with
the windows open, or on a protected
porch, dressing him warmly in out-of-door
clothing. He should be taken
out during tho middle of the day, for
a little while, never long enough to
run the risk of chilling him. This
applies especially to young and del
icate babies. As a child gets old
enough to walk about and thus exer
cise himself, ho can be allowed to
play for some time in an open room
or where he is sheltered from the
wind.
But an airing every day doea not
take the place of fresh air In the
house, day and night, and to secure
sufficient ventilation for health the
mother must be on the watch to see
that the rooms are opened and the
air changed at frequent Intervals.

and furniture to reliable people. Con

A WONDERFUL REVIVAL.
Tho greatest revival that history
has recorded for St. Stephen Baptist
churoluwas conducted by the pastor,
Rev. Dr. J. W, Hurse, Nov. 28, 1915,
to Jan. E, 1916. Each service was large
ly attended and on Sunday evening
it was Just Impossible to accommo
date the people. The sermons he
preached was delivered with much
power and understanding and he par
ticipated in the greater part of the
song service. This great mystifying
leader was Inspired to start an old
fashioned Southern revival In Decem
ber, when the masses of people were
giving their time to worldly merri
ment and Jollification. So deeply was
Rev. Hurse Impressed that he repeat
edly announced that if you will seek
and find Jesus It will be the greatest
Christmas present you ever received
In your life. The all night services
of Christmas was a new feature but
It pleased Almighty God, and with
zero weather and streets covered with
snow the people came from Kansas
City, Kas., Independence, Mo., and
from all parts of the city to witness
the sunrise baptism of 19 candidates
put on Christ by baptism.
Tho Almighty God continuing to
work through, his .gospel leader and
men, women, boys and girls demon
strating that they wanted to find Je
sus, resulted In a glorious victory for
God's army and a happy, happy New
Year for 22 more candidates for bap
tism. We are proud indeed to say
that In this number Clarence Lyons
and Thelma Robinson, both students
of High School, realized that science
would not go any farther than tho
grave, and they two sought for "old
time religion" and were baptized Sun
day with the others.
One of th emost beautiful pictures
was the constant companionship that
Rev. J. W. Hurse's mother was to him
during the meeting. She was ever
at her post offering up invocation and
singing' Zlon's song to help win souls
for Christ. The Christmas offering
far excelled any previous one. New
Year's eve brought out the usual large
crowd regardless of the heavy rain.
Many were turned away that could
not find standing room. Rev. Hurse
so beautifully Illustrated his text and
made so plain the word of God that
a very intelligent young man and girl
came forward and made It known that
they. too. had found Jesus and too
much can not be said about a gospel
mdssenger who ,1s helping to shape,
the lives of our boys and girls and j
improving the lives of men and worn-,
en and making happy homes.
With a glorious victory achieved we
rejoice to say that our prayers have
been answered and 48 candidates, 37
restorations, making a total of 85 ad
ditions to the church. Wo Indeed
want to thank the editor of the Sun
for the manner in which they carried
the progrm of our revival services.
By reading the. Sun and looking over
the outline of sermons, caused many
men to think on their way and some
have willingly acknowledged that
"after reading I come to see what you
were doing in the North end," and
today they are rejoicing. May this
great editor live long to continue to
advertise work of the Master and hast
en the time when every member of
St. Stephen Baptist church will be a
subscriber for the Sun.
HOW SALEM TUTT WHITNEY BE
CAME AN ACTOR.
Colored Comedian Saw "Uncle Tom's
Cabin" and That Settled It.
The parents of Salem Tutt Whitney,
the colored comedian, dramatist and
newspaper" man, had great hopes for
him. They expected to see him a Bap
tist minister some day. The young
man was not opposed to their wishes
and would probably have been preach
ing today had not the unforesoon hap
pened, which made htm an actor In
stead. Salem attended school, and
ono day while spending the summer
vacation at his home in Mitchell, Ind.,
his mother sent him to the store to
purchase some provisions for the even
ing meal. Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cab
in" was to give a street parade when
the boy was on his errand. There
was a band, a troupe of bloodhounds,
little Eva riding In an old delivery
wagon, crudely arranged tot look like
a chariot as .much as possible and all
the features irrevocably associated
with an Uncle Tom parade. The band
was a good one and Whitney, who
had a bouI for mejody,- was so strong
ly Impressed with the music that he
fell in line with the parade and fol
lowed It to its destination. Ordinar
ily the lad had a good appetite and
never failed to be "home at meal time.
On this occasion, however, he forgot
all about eating and attended the per
forniance, which was given under a
tent. That was the turning point of
his career, for from that time on the
stage claimed his nttentlon. He saw
the play and heard the singing and
ho decided that ho would follow the
calling of an actor. Ho had a strong
bass voice and he felt certain that he
could sing well if not better than any
member of that company.
ORATORICAL CONTEST.
The second annual oratorical and
musical contest under the auspices of
the Kansas City Branch of the N. A.

Kansas City Selected
National Negro Business League to
Hold Seventeenth Annual Session
August 16, 1916.
After a most careful consideration
of the several invitations received
from different sections of the coun
try for the next meeting of the Na
tional Negro Business League, we are

ecutive committee to announce that
the league has decided to accept the
Invitation extended by the local Ne
gro Business League of Greater Kan

has selected a most opportune time
to hold their meeting in Kansas City,
for as Mr. Fortune J. Weaver, presi
dent of the Kansas City League says:
'These dates fit in Just right, as the
Masons will hold their Grand Lodge
In Kansas City during the second
week of August and the National Med
ical Association comes during the
fourth week."
These two meetings In addition to
the Business League session, will of
fer best possible Inducements to the
railroads to make special reduced
fares and will afford delegates to the
Grand Lodge and the Medical Asso
ciation an opportunity to attend some
ot the sessions of the Business League.
The executive committee has also
decided that it will be most appro
priate and fitting that the first night's
(August 10) session be devoted to
memorial exercises in honor of Dr.
Booker T. Washington, founder and
first president of the National Negro
Business League.

the forthcoming meeting of the Na-
tlonal Negro Business League will be

Among- the callers this week was

Bait Lake City, and one of the fore
most 'Masons ot this country. The
extremely inclement weather has kept
Mr. Ne&l confined to his home during

NEGROES AT THE THEATERS.
I must admit that I highly appre
ciated J. A. Wilson's thoughtfulness
in criticising that light hearted and
mirth loving Negro who was so un
couth as to disturb the attendants at
the play "On Trial" at the Shubert
theater. But in speaking of a rep
resentative audience I feel that he
omitted the main class. There seems
to be a growing spirit among a great
number of intelligent Negroes, both
writers and speakers, to class the. peo
ple of their race as did J. A. Wilson.
First class, "lawyers, doctors, profes
sors and teachers;" second class, "the
light hearted and mirth loving type
the kind that frequents club rooms,
pool halls, low theaters and lounge
around barber shops and street cor
ners." I attended the play "On Trial '
and know a great number that attend
ed during the two weeks. They are
friends and acquaintances ot mine.
People of principle, good morals and
intelligent mothers, fathers and oth
erwise. But they are not professional,
still we feel Judlng from these quali
ties that we are competent to cope
with the average professional. I live
in hopes that the time will come when
the professional man or woman will
not be held up as the only first class
Negro people; for, everyone can not
professional. I also long to see the
day when to the first class will be
added that honest, industrious, law
abiding intelligent Negro that is the
making of the lawyer, doctor, profess
or and teacher.
