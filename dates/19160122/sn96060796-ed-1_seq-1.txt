A report just issued by Tom

SYSTEMATIC MINING.
Andes Group at Patagonia Producing
High Grade Copper.
Work on the Andes Group in
Red Mountain, under bond from
R. R. Richardson to C. C. San
ders and associates, is going
ahead regularly and with much
promise. The winze from the
tunnel is said to be still in the
copper glance, and the initial
shipment of 50,000 pounds will
be made from his property in
a day or two, says the Santa
Cruz Patagonian.
The ore is causing considerable
comment from mining people of
the district. Nearly everyone in
town and many strangers pass
ing through have examined the
dump as it is being added to by
each burro train. What the ship
ment will run in a matter of con
jecture, being variously estimat
ed at from 10 to 25 per cent
copper. Great quantities of cop
per glance (chalcocite) in the ore
will bring up the value of the
shipment, notwithstanding that
there is lots of waste in the ore.
The proximity of Red Moun
tain to the camp of Patagonia is
probably one of the causes of in
terest being centered upon this
most recent strike, as well as
the excellent character of the
ore. It is only about two miles
just back of town, and it is real
ized if a big mine is found in Red
Mountain it will guarantee a
splendid future for Patagonia.
Duquesne Mines Increase Shipments.
The mill of the Duquesne Min
ing & Reduction company, a re
cently installed flotation system,
has been temporarily shut down
on account of lack of sufficient
water. The flotation process had
proved a success in the treat
ment of Duquesue ores, which
carry ahigh percentage of zinc,
It is said to be the intention of
the management to install a
pumping plant on the Santa
Cruz river somewhere near the
international boundary line and
pipe water to the plant, a dis
tance of several miles. It is also
believed that when the water
question has been satisfactorily
settled, the mill will be enlarged.
The mine will continue ship
ping its high grade ore3 to the
Douglas smelter from Patagonia
while the work of developing
more water for the mill is in
process. The Duquesne is a West
inghouse property, and is one
of the most faithful producers in
this part of the state, its ores
being a very high-grade copper.

mission. At the meeting of the state
board of tax commissioners held
in Phoenix, it was decided to
adopt for the state use during

The corporation commission
has taken another step toward
making Arizona's "blue sky" law
more rigid. Hereafter new com
panies will be granted permits
to sell stock only on condition
that shares issued for promotion
of property be pooled and not
sold till the treasury stock au
thorized by the permit has been
disposed of, and the proceeds
paid into the treasury. Com
plaints reached the commission
that the financially responsible
organizers of several companies
have sqjd their own shares as
soon as permits to seJl treasury
stock had been secured.

ating water should secure a copy
