In tho fourteen years that I have

Everybody Is busy. Monoy la plenti

EXPERIENCES '
OF TRIP FOR
LOAD OF ELK
somo real tnriuers wero experienc
ed by J. C. Smith, deputy fish and
gnmo warden, L. F. Wlnchell nnd
Kd Smith, while bringing homo tho
carload of elk secured for Cacho
county by purchase from tho govern
ment. Tho party succeeded In get
ting tho elk Into tho cars and safo
ly on Umj way homo, but tho troubles
bad oily begun.
Upon rcnchlng Llvlngstono, on the
return trip from Gardiner whoro the
elk wore rounded up, they had a lit
tlo tusslo with what seemed to be
certain death. While In the rail
road yard for connection with tho
train that should bring tho elk nnd
tho koopcrs to Utnh, tho cabooso in
which these gentlemen wero riding
was pushed up tho main track to bo
attached to the train. It was up hill
and tho motlvo power was a big mal
let onglne. All of n sudden coming
down the track directly toward them
was seen an onglno pulling a passen
ger train. Thoro wns no warning:
tho trnlns camo togethor, tho passen
ger engine striking tho cabooso, turn
ing It over and splintering the. Bides
and floor. Ed Smith saw tho np
proachlng train In time to Jump, but
il. ntl.A... niArn tnalili tlin fTr nml
could not got out. Thokv woro roll
ed about and " Jarred considerably,
Mr. Smith says, but fortunatel es
caped serious injury.
In corralling tho oik for shipment
a ltttlo strntcgy is used by tho keep
ers. A largo corral stands near by
nnd a lino of hay Is extended from
tho feeding grounds directly Into tho
corrall . Tho elk feed along all un
suspicious of their destination and
when thoy aro Insldo tho cnclosuro
a kcoper located In a ltttlo room DO
yards distant, pulls a ropo closing a
sliding gato, and tho oik aro trapped.
Thoy aro then driven through a
chuto into wagons and loaded from
tho wagons on to tho train.
A word of prnlso Is duo tho Oregon
Short Lino Company for allowing a
handsomo robato on the freight
charges from Wyoming to this stato.
