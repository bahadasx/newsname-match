SAY BRIBERY
WAS USED TO
NDICT LABOR
PEACE AGENT!
former Congressman Fowler of
Illinois Makes Charges
Against Officials Responsible
for Buchanan's Plight
Statement Made at Preliminary
Hearing Before Commission
er Anson S Taylor Here To
day. Charges that "more than dollar
bills -were used" to bring about
the indictments returned by the
Federal grand jury in New York
against officials of Labor's Na
tional Peace Council were made
today at the preliminary hearing
given three of the defendants by
United States Commissioner An
son Taylor.
The " allegation was made by
former Congressman H. Robert
Fowler of Illinois, one of the de
fendants, who further charged
that "the bribe Was so big that
even the birds in the woods would
be starred by it. If I were the
commissioner in thisicase I would
rcHKpvcry- precedent anoaiow
the) criminal and foul means to
bring about this indictment to be
shown."
BREAK NO PRECEDENT.
Assistant District Attorney James
Archer, who represented the Govern
ment a.t the hearing:, aald it was .not
necessary to break any precedent,
that the Supreme Court had held that
It was the duty pf the Commlrslonera
to hear every reason tending to show
that there was not probable cause for
extradition.
"Will you consent to our going into
that phase of this indictment?" asked
Mr. Fowler.
"It is not necessary to have my per
mission, you have got a ruling from
the Supreme Court to jculde you." re
Illed.Mr. Archer.
The incident ended here, however, as
Mr. Fowler made no further reference
to the mo&ns -employed In bringing
about the Indictment.
Mr. Fowler's charge emanated In an
innocent wy. When he arose to attack
the indictment as defective and to quote
several anti-trust decisions he had two
St bills in the law book with which to
pay Commissioner Taylor's clerk for
copying the Indictment. Mr. Arcner
facetiously remarked that "it seems ap
propriate that II bills be used as book
marks In an antl-trust case. '
Mr. Fowler pleasantly remarked that
this was not Intended as a show of
wealth because he was not a rich man.

Cental that the London offices of the

Agency were "raided" recently by
Scotland Yard men wan made today by

"message between his New York and
English Offices.' He also scored the
agents of another American detective
service, who, he declared, had tried to
put his agency "In bad" with tho Kng
lish authorities.
"I presume that the constant inter
change of code messages between my
offices In New York and London caused
the Investigation after agents of an
other detective concern had tnld the
Scotland Yard people that they might
find some German spy matters If they
investigated my 4-ondon place," said
Mr. Burns.
"Scotland Yard men came to my Eng
lish manager and showed him a cable
gram in code which had been sent by
me to London and asked him what the
message meant He explained to their
saUsfactlon and told them tha't If they
wn.ni.ea 10 go over mo orrice nies they
were at liberty to do so They returned
several days later and searched the
files.
"Of course they did ont And any
thing to verify their suspicions. This
Is only one of the petty annoyances with
which a man has to contend who tries
to eliminate his own employ of crooks.
Every man I discharge goes out to make
trouble for me, and things like this are
Douna to result."

LONDON, Jan. 22. An attack by
German super-dreadnaught, armed with
17-Inch guns capable of throwing shells
weighing more than a ton a distance
of morethan twenty nrtas, may startle
England before many months, the Dally

The naval critic of the News report

new battleships. Including probabK the
Hindenburg, with the 17-imh guns, lie
expiessed the belief that tho same gun
were used In the long-range bombard

and that tho Germans mleht wed ri.b-

When suddenly thrust Into the lime

so nervous that her answers were
scarcely' audible to the attorneys.

Miss Stevenson disarmed the negroes'

PERSIA fHPLY HALTS
AMERICAN ACTION
United States Has No Proof
That Liner Was Submarined
by Austrian or German.
Unofficial advices from Vienna that
the Austro-Hungarlan government has
disclaimed all responsibility for sink
ing of the British steamer Persia, with
loss of two American lives, leaves the
United States without any official proof
that tne Persian was lorpeaoea.
The German government previously
had notified the State Department that
reporta received from all submarine
commanders proved that the Persia was
not tdrpedoa by a uerman submarine.
State Department officials say that
the United States cannot go further In
fixing responsibility until It has some
facts upon which to proceed. Thus far
the only testimony bearing on the Per
sia case consists of dentals of respon
sibility by Germany and Austria and
nffidnvlu of Persia survivors which
fall to establish legal facts showing
the vessel was torpedoed.
Advices from Berlin that the German
foreign office has sent further instruc
tions to Count von Bernstorft In the
Lusttanla negotiations are accepted as
foreshadowing tne eariy settlement of
this controversy. The fact that the
State Department Is preparing the way
for the presenting or claims ror in
demnlty Is taken as an Indication that
the United States Government expect
to reach a satisfactory settlement with
Berlin. Count von Bernstorff. from the
first, has been confident of success.
Transfer Is Denied.
The Excise Board todav refused the
application of Georre Nesllne for the
transfer of a wholesale llauor license
from Annie B. Hohmann, at 1(R7 Fifth

The new revolution started around

tory the Carranzjstas had regarded as
completely under their control.
The Mexican consulate, which yester
day announced the execution of eight
een bandits, has obtained no official
confirmation. General Cavasej said
that when he left Chihuahua city the
eighteen prisoners were being held,
awaiting execution. He had no way of
knowing definitely whether the execu
tions were carried out after he left, but
expressed no surprise. He said the of
ficials were collecting evidence to show
that the men had participated In the
Santa Ysabel massacre of Americans.
Advices from the Interior of Chihua
hua asserted that Villa had resumed
activity In the Guerra district and that
raids on several ranches wore reported.
