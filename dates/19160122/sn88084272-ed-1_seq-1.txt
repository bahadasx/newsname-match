"Hello 'Shorty.'
N Downs said he saw ifive men come
1r the door of the Duran house and
heard one of them say to Akers:
"Hello 'Shorty.' "What are you doing
here"'
This is considered as positive proof
that the Americans were known to the
Mexicans:
Downs said he heard a shot from the
front of the house. I then saw the
Mexican policeman come around the
corner of the house holding his breast
and he threw his pistol to the ground
as if h was wounded," Downs told
Vthe rangers. "I was mounted and rode
around to the front and saw Akers.
Akers jumped on behind me on mv
horse and we rode toward the ford. The
Mexicans mounted the horse Akers and

KILL AMERICANS
Convention Held at Cordoba
at Which Murder and De
struction Are Planned.
"Washington, D C, Jan 22 Details
are now becoming known concerning a
rebel convention recently held at Cor
doba. Mexico, at which representatives
of Villa, Zapata. Argumedo, Iliginio
Agullar and the Cedillo brothers met
and plotted the killing of Americans
in Mexico, the destruction of merican
property and the carrying on of a war
to a finish against Carranza.
Meager reports of this gathering
came to the state department long ago,
but they were not made public and
until Friday night, few persons in
Washington knew that there was a
general conspiracy against Americans,
or even that the various rebel factions
in the field In Mexico had effected any
kind of an agreement for concrete ac
tivities against the de facto govern
ment. The recent massacre at Santa Ysabel,
Chih, attributed to bandits, led by Villa
officers, is believed- to have been per
petrated in accordance with the rebel
convention order. Officials think the
long period elapsed after the Cordoba
meeting, before the murders, because of
the time required by the various dele
gates to make reports to their com
manders, and the fact that news of the
conventions decision had to be carried
subordinate military commanders by
couriers. Cordoba is on the railroad
between Veracruz and Mexico City and
some 1000 miles from Santa YsabeL
Carrania AuthorltlesAdvUed.
The Carranza authorities hate been
fullv advised concerning the move-
ments of the rebels, and have been de-
pended upon by the Washington gov-
ernment to take every possible pr.ecau-
tion to prevent the threats against
Americans from being carried out.
Thev are believed to have the situa-
tton fairly -well hi hand now. although
the chiefs whose delegates met at Cor
doba still are in the field operating
mere er less openly
Soon after Carranza was recognized
the state department withdrew its con
sular officers from northern Mexico
and reiterated its warning to Ameri
cans to leave. Only by getting citi
zens of the United States from territory
not fully controled by the de facto gov
ernment, it was believed, could there
be any real assurance of safetj.
Convention Lasted Some Day.
Few details of the Cordoba conien
tlon are known, but according to the
reports, it lasted for several days and
some of the earlier arrivals awaited
probably weeks for all the delegates to
appear. Apparently, the call for the
meeting was sent out as soon as it be
came certain th2t the United States
was aboutto recognize Carranza. al
though It was a month after recogni
tion actually had been accorded be
fore the delegates got together At
that time large forces of Villa and Za
pata forces were operating in the
neighborhood of the railroads near
Mtxlco City, and it was possible for
the convention to assemble and do its
work with comparative safet from In
terruption. Whether there Is anv great proba
bility of continued concerted action
among the factions fighting Carranza,
officials here do not profess to know.
Some Information has reached here to
indicate that money mav be forthcom
ing to finance a revolutior on a con
siderable scale, with the hope of enlist
ing the support of all the rebels, but
officials Friday night said the-e were
no reports to show that such a move
