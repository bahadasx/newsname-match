PRESIDENT WILL
OUTLINE COURSE
Washington, Jan. 4.-A complete
ahowdown between the United States
snd the Teutonic allies on the subject
of submarine warfare is likely to be
the outcome of the sinking of the
British liner Persia, according to opin
ions expressed in high official circles.
In the same quarters it is regarded
as more than probable that within
the next few days the United States
will approach informally the entente
powers, with a view to getting them
to agree henceforth to permit no guns
to be mounted on passenger liners.
The purpose of both of these moves,
iiow under consideration, say respon
sible officials, is to safeguard the
lives of American citizens who may
be compelled to take passage on the
high seas on merchant ships flying
the flags of belligerent nations.
If this end is attained, it is declared,
the sinking of the Persia, tragic as it
was in the enormous toll of human
life, may after all prove a. blessing in
disbuise.
President Wilson is back in Wash
ington from Hot Springs, Va., and will
take charge of the entire situation.
It is likely, too, that there will be a
general airing of views on the floors
of both the house and senate. Return-;
ing members talked of little but con
sequences that might result from the
sinking of the Persia.
Although administration leaders are
uniformly inclined to proceed cap
tiously and to await positive informa
tion there is a general feeling of un
easiness among senators and represen
tatives over the gravity of foreign af
fairs.
It seems assured that the senate
committee on foreign affairs will take
up the resolution submitted by Sena
tor Hoke Smith calling for an inquiry
into Great Britain's interferences withl
neutral commerce and the amendment
by Senator Lodge to investigate de
struction of the Lusitania and other
acts by belligerents resulting in de
struction of American lives.
ASKS RELEASE OF CONSULS
Berlin, Jan. 4.-The Greek govern
nent. having protested against the
seizure of consuls of the central em
pire.s by the allies at Saloniki, has
now made formal request that the
consuls be released, according to Sofia
reports.
The Greek officers and Greek gen
darmes detailed to protect the con
sulates were punished.
General Sarreil has been informed'
that before taking any action againsi
consuls of the central empires he
should have first notified the Greek
government. The Greek people, the
dispatches said, are indignant because
of the consuls seizure.
ITALY COMMANDEERS SHIPS
New Orleans, Jan. 4.-Advices to
shipping interests here said the Ital
ian governm'ent had commandeered
for transport purposes twenty-seven
steamships of the Pearce-Cottoneria
and Creole lines, which maintain regu
lar sailings between Italy and gulf
ports.
To Requisition Leather.
Paris, Jan. 4.-The government, to
satisfy the needs of the army, has de
cided on a general requisitioning of
crude leather.
DISEASE SPREADS RAPIDLY
Washington, Jan. 4.--Influenza is
spreading over the United States from
coast to coast in the most serious epi
demic ever known, taking a large toll
in lives and causing economic loss by
incapacitating workers in all walks of
life.
Reports from public health service
officers, made public by Surgeon Gen
eral Blue, show that already the dis
ease has created a grave problem for
many of the larger cities and is
spreading to the rural communities.
New York, Chicago, Philadelphia,
Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Cleve
land and Detroit reported the disease
widely prevalent. Cleveland and De
troit each have probably 10,000 cases.
Veteran Editor Ie Dead.
Kansas City, Jan. 4.-Colonel Rob.
ert Thompson Van Horn, founder of
the Kansas City Journal and for for
ty-one years editor of that paper, died
at his home here. He was ninety-one
years old. Death was due to the in
4rmities of age.
Snow Forty-four Inches -eep.
Grand Junction, Colo., Jan. 3.
Western Colorado is in the grip of
one of the worst snow storms in
years. An average of twenty-three
inches of snow covers the Grand val
ley. Snow in Unaweep canon is re
onrted to be forty-four inches deep.
STICKING TO IT WINS
FOR ELI TELOUSE
On November 1, 1910, Eli Telouse
filed an application to homestead 80
acres in 19-20. His application was 4
I suspended for the reason that the land
was not appraised and for two years
or more it remained dormant in the
archives of the general land office.
Finally" appraisers were sent out to
classify nnd appraise the Flathead In
dian lands which were overlooked by
the original commission which classi
fied and appraised the land in the first
instance, or before any one was al
lowed to homestead the land. This
commission in its wiseness, found that
one 40 which Mr. Telouse had applied
for had a few more trees growing on
same than the law Hallowed and classi
fled the land as timber land, while the
other 40 was appraised and he received
an approved homestead entry for that
portion, But Mr. Telouse did not feel
like giving up the other 40, especially
when he had made so many valuable
improvements on the land, and he
started in to see if the department
could not be induced to change its rul
ing thereon.
Five years rolled around, short when
one looks backward through the mists
of time, but long when striving to get
the department of the interior to re
verse or move a decision. Nothing
daunted by failure after failure, but
sticking to it like a puppy to a root,
Mr. Telouse made application after ap
- plication, made appeal after appeal,
and finally, one day this week, received
official notification from the Missoula
land office that if he would make the
first one-third payment of the ap
praised value of the land within 30
days, he would be granted an approved
additional homestead entry for the
long sought 40 acres.
Mr. Telouse is indebted to Senator
Myers for much hard work on his be
rhalf, and also to C. F. Rathbone of
Ronan, who has been his attorney
throughout the long battle.
Sticking to it pays, even with the
department of the interior.
ENGLE ASKS COMMIISSION
ERS TO BUILO JAIL AT RONAN
Last Friday morning's Missoulian
says:
The county commissioners were
asked yesterday to build a jail at Ro
nan, the request coming from William
Engle, deputy sheriff stationed in the
reservation town. Engle complained
that he has no place to keep prisoners
while preparing to transport them to
the county's prison in Missoula. The
commissioners encouraged Engle to
take his problem to the town author
Ities, promising co-operation, if pos
sible.
There is no jail in all that part of
the reservation within Missoula and
Sanders counties and the absence of one
has been a hardship on the officers of
this section. Mr. Engle's request is a
just one and should have received fa
vorable consideration. The suggestion
that the town officers take the matter
up, should be followed, and a joint
town and county jail might be secured.
INDIANA AND KENTUCKY
BOOST FOR FAIRBANKS
At a big republican love feast held
in Indianapolis on December 30th,
Former Vice President Charles W.
Fairbanks of Indiana was the hero. He
was endorsed as Indiana's choice for
the republican nomination for president
and at the same meeting, which filled
to overflowing the largest theatre in
the state, Edwin P. Morrow pledged
.him the solid delegation from Ken
tucky in the national convention at
Chicago next June.
Mr. Fairbanks was given a noisy
ovation when he responded to an invi
tation to speak after his name had
been proposed for the presidential nom
ination by Edwin P. Morrow of Ken
tucky.
"The people have tried democracy,"
said Mr, Fairbanks when the enthusi
asm had quieted down sufficiently for
him to begin, "and democracy has
tried them. The result has been a
re-baptised, re united party of oppo
sition. There is no divided republican
ism here-we are united as of old."
His speech was very brief, but he
dealt vigorously with the leading ques
tions. He urged the necessity of not
only adequate national preparedness
against hostile invasion, but also ade
quate national protection against in
dustrial invasion.
Democratic Club Meeting
The members of the Ronan Demo
cratic club are hereby invited to attend

For the purpose of discussing. and if
thought best, to pass resolutions ex
pressing the views of this club in re
gard to some of the questions now be
fore congress.

MANY MONTANA SALOONS
CLOSED ON JANUARY 1ST
In accordance with a law passed at
the last legislature prohibiting saloons
to run in the state unless there was a
population of 50 people within a radius
of a quarter of a mile of the location
of the saloon, many Montana saloons
were closed at 10 o'clock on the night
of December 31st, the law taking effect
on January 1. The new law closed the
saloons in Lolo and Clinton, this coun
ty, and it is understood the saloon at
Proctor, Flathead county, is among the
has-beens.
With prohibition going into effect in
the states of Washington, Oregon,
Idaho, Colorado and three other states
on January 1st, and the diminishing of
the number of saloons in Montana and
many other states, the prohibitionists
are riding the top waves. The results
of prohibition in the states of Wash
ington, Oregon and Idaho will be
watched with considerable interest by
the people of Montana and will un
doubtedly have more or less influence
on the vote here next fall.
The Great Dot Mystery
Nothing appeals to the human mind
like mystery. There's a fascination
about a combination before the eyes
that at first glance means nothing at
all, but which figured out reveals the
hidden meaning. That is why the Dot.
Series of outline pictures, now running
every day in the Anaconda Standard,
has siezed upon the imagination, espe
cially of the young. Something is hid
den from the view. Numerals joined
together by pencil bring out in bold re
lief an object, the identity of which
has been a matter of surmise. One
day it is a dog that has frightened the
boy campers; the next it is a strange
animal of the forest that has tempo
rarily disturbed their peace. Followed
day by day the Dot Series furnishes
.an enthralling story of adventure. In
Standard families there is a scramble
to be first at the paper; it means first
solution of the day's mystery. No
daily newspaper feature in years has
so appealed to the young people. Yet
frequently the older members of the
family are caught at work with the
pencil-when they beat the youngsters
to it.
Mary Pickford-everybody who ever
went to a movie show knows Mary
Pickford-will hereafter figure in the
daily editions of the Standard. She
will write on all sorts of vital and ab
sorbing subjects in which her remark
able career has made her experienced
beyond her years. This young woman
is the highest paid artist who has ever
appeared on the dramatic stage or be
fore the camera and in addition has the
credit of being the most popular girl
in the world. There is nothing af
fected about Mary Pickford; she has
won her way through her own sweet
disposition and her charming features.
The has a message for other girls and
that message coming from an experi
ence that has befallen few young
women in these great United States,
is bound to be both interesting and in
structive.
Montague Glass, inimitable Hebrew
biographer, creator of "Potash and
Perlmutter," is with the Sunday Stan-:
dard again with two new personages,
Brisky and Zapp, whose dialogue is
even better than that of their famed
predecessors.
Charlie Chaplin, funniest man in
filmdom, is telling the story of his life
in the Sunday Standard with all of the
humor in words that his funny antics
bring out on the screen.
This isn't all. Communion with the
Anaconda Standard, daily and Sunday,
at 65 cents per month or $7 per year in
advance, will reveal other reasons
somewhat numerous.

public notices and all legal papers re
quiring filing for permanent record.
The Great Falls land office shows
3,356 filings on homesteads in 1915,
compared to 2,579 for 1914, or more
than an average of two a day increase
for every day in the year.
In district court the number of civil
actions instituted was 1,005, compared
with 828 in 1914. Criminal cases hint
of better community life, as there
were but 82 cases in 1915, compared
with 88 in 1914.
Children of school age in the county

PROFITS IN WOOL INCREASE
Growers Will Net About $1,000,000
More for 1915 Fleece.
Although Montana wool growers
sold 4,000,000 pounds less of wool in
1915 than in 1914 they will net $1,o000,
0)00 mlore for their fleeces than laAI.
y'ar. Thin is the estimaute made by
E. A. Gray, general agent of the Chi
.ago and Northwestern railway,. who
is considered an authority on the sub
ject.
The 1914 figures for wool in Mon
tana were 29,000,000 pounds, while this
year the state produced 25,000,000
pounds. There is believed to be a fur
ther decrease in wool figures due in
1916, but it is thought that the differ
ence will not be as great as between
1914 and 1915. The good quality of
Montana wool and the higher prices
induced by the war have caused the
increased profits.

So much encouragement has been
received by the Montana exposition
:ommission in the plan to keep the
Iontana building open at San Diego,
ýal., all next year while the fair was t

INTEREST IN NUT GROWING
Northern Climate May Not Favor Pec
can Raising.
Pecan growing in Oklahoma is at
tracting many Custer county farmers
and several in the eastern section of
Montana are considering the possibil
ities with a view of engaging in the
business, according to Jerome T. Bell,
Custer county rancher, who was in
Butte recently.
"A neighbor of mine, George Elden,
has some relatives down in the Skla
look country in Oklahonma," he said.
"They formerly lived in the vicinity of
Miles City, but they are raising pecans
now. They have written some of their
old friends saying that pecan farmers
in Oklahoma are getting rich."
Mr. Bell said that in Tulsa county.
Oklahoma, where the pecan farming is
most extensive, the farmers have
found that they can graft pecans to
hickory trees and get a crop within
two years. They are growing paper
shell pecans, which bring 50 to 75
ccents a pound, compared with 15 to
20 cenits for the common ]ihud.
Asked if there was any moveicment
to take up pecan growing in Montana,
Mr. Bell said that lie understood that.
the climate was not favorable, the
trees requiring heat and boggy land.
and that the hickory tree probably
would not do well here.
