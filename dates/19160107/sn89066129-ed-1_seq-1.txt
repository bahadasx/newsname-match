CLEAN-UP IS ORDERED
Gty CouncU Take Action Against
Gambling Devices
There was something doing at
. the regular monthly meeting of the
city council last Monday night.
; There were many speeches made,
much law expounded and some
definite business transacted,
Judge 0. F. Libby, executor of
the Mills Coleman estate, was
present and on behalf of the heirs
of the estate presented, the city
with a check for $200.00, a dona
tion to the cemetery fund. The
donation was made on suggestion
of Alex Coleman, who stated that
in as much as it was the wish of
his brother and wife that they be
buried here, and as the estate
would be all removed, thus de
priving Laclede of the benefits of
taxation, hedeemed it right and
proper that some arrangement be
made to help bear the expense of
caring' for the cemetery in the
future hence the donation, This
was certainly a commendable act
and one that the people of Laclede
appreciate. The board promptly
passed a suitable resolution accept
ing the donation. , ' ''
The scence now shifts to a con
dition of things in this town that
is not commendable a specie of
evil that has grown rapidly the
past two years through lax law
enforcement.
A committee of business men
appeared before the board and
urged that the Sunday closing law
be enforced. The discussion that
followed developed the fact that
that was not the only state statute
and city ordinance that was being
flagrantly violated. It pointed out
that slot machines, punch boards
and other, gambling devices were
being operated that had developed
a bunch of gamblers in this com
munity that would put the most
active frontier town to shame. The
city attorney read the law relating
to these things and it was made
plain that all that was needed was
its enforcement.
Councilman .Albin took the lead
and moved that vigorous action be
taken against all violaters com
plained of. Councilman Allen
promptly seconded the motion.
The other two members promptly
fell in line and the motion carried
unanimously.
The, marshal was then called
upon the carpet and his attention
called to his duties in the matter.
He was instructed to see that the
Sunday closing law was complied
with in the future, and directed to
notify .all operators of slot ma
chines, punch boards and other
gambling devices that they must
cease operation at once. He' per
formed that duty and by eight
o'clock the next morning every
punch board and all but two slot
machines had disappeared. It is
understood that these two have ex
pressed a desire to test the state
statute in regard to slot machines,
which they have a perfect right
. to do.
And from what Thk Blade can
learn the clean-up is not going to
stop here. There are other things
going on in this town that are
being investigated, facts gathered
and the matter will no doubt go to
the prosecuting attorney in due
time.
