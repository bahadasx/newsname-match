Disappeared From Home
Christmas Eve.
USES WIFE'S BUTCHER
KNIFE TO CUT THROAT
Finder, Horrified, Flees Through
Cemetery To Town And
Callapses.
The story of how the body of John
hiump, Perryville man who loft homo
Christinas eve saying he was going to
kill himself, was foun.l Tuesday in a
cave near a graveyard a mile and a
half from Perryville, yesterday was
f id in the Cape by persons who ar
rived from there.
Klump's throat was tut from ear iO
ear and the head was almost sew:"-!.
Hi.- face was cut and scratched lit
eral places.
The body was found by a trapper,
who had crawled into the cave for the
puipose of setting a trap with which
to catch fur-bearing animals.
Klump was a teamster in Perry
ville. He was about 00 years old and
veil known there. He lived with his
wife and eight children on the edge
f town. He often had been employed
to do several odd jobs for persons liv
ing in Perryville.
Christmas eve he went home and
cn going into the kitchen grabbed up
the butcher knife lying on the table
:.nd started for the door, he announc
ed that he was going away to kill him
self. His wife attempted to reach him to
regain th k.W ::.l V.cr;: him vi
lor.c. rf vaded her a rrn. Sk?
lould not follow-him in the darkr.ers.
He did not return that night, but at
lust, it was believed that he would not
carry out his threat. When he failed
to return home Christmas day and on I
th. next two or three days, a search
was instituted. The hunt was car
vied to many places around Perryville,
but to no avail.
The trapper, who found Klump's
body had passed through the cemetery
i:tit a short time before and went to
the mouth of the cave, where he had
L.-en accustomed to placing one of his
t-r-ps. Tiw cave extends several feet
iiUo the ground and he had crawled
far enough into the cavern so that the
!:ylight was shut off.
He lighted a match and looked al
most directly into the face of the dead
man. He had crawled into the cav
ern till he had come just to the body
Mid had he put out his hand for prog
ress another foot into the cave, he
would have touched Klump's body.
The trapper fled from the cavern
.ml ran all the way to Perryville to
tel" what he had seen. It was several
minutes after he got in Perryville that
lie could be revived from a state of
1 ervous collapse before he could an
r ounce the discovery of the body.
A party of men then accompanied
him from Perryville to the mouth of
the cavern, and the body of Klump !
'was taken from the ulace. The knife
which he had carried away from his
home was foun dnear his body inside
the cavern.

he recovered.
He was one of his local high school's

circulated in London, but no message
received from Germany has confirmed
them. Paris wires that a report cur

report is without official sanction.
London, Jan. . John Redmond,
the Irish leader, stated in the House
of Commons this afternoon that the
Irish party would not support the gov

service. "The measure is unneces

New York, Jan. .'. Judge Elbert
H. Gary, chairman of the Hoard of Di
rectors of the United Steel corpora

ment relative to the steel industry and
the European war.
Judge Gary shows that the United
States is Unlay producing steel at the
rate of 41,000,000 tons per annum, as
compared with the btt previous rec
ord of ."nOOO.000 tons. He asserts
that a long continuance of the Euro
pean war would be suicidal and sounds
a note f warning to th'' United
States. If the conflict rages for an
other year, Judge Gary believes this
government will be in a condition

Washington, Jan. 5. President Wil
son's urgent appeal that the Senate
refrain from a discussion of the sub
marine warfare, pending negotiations
between this government and Austria,
was thrown to the winds this after
noon while the solons engaged in the
most sensational debate since the out
break of the war.
Senator Works of California charg
ed the government with being moral
ly guilty of murder because it did not
keep Amercans from riding on belli
gerent ships. He pleaded for an em
bargo on the exportation of ammu
nitions. "Do you think it was unpatriotic
for Consul McNeely to travel on a bel
ligerent vessel?" Senator Nelson of
Minnesota asked.
"I think it would have been much
better for him to have traveled on a
neutral vessel," said Jones.
Senator O'Gorman then asserted
there was a neutral vessel on which
McXeely could have traveled, but
that he preferred to take a chance on
one belonging to a belligerent nation.
"But he would not have been safe,"
said Xelson. "Many neutral vessels,
including those of Scandinavian na
tions, have been sunk since the begin
ning of the war."
"Officers of this government knew
that vessel was loaded to the guards
with munitions of war and the nation
was at fault that it did not prevent

RACE FOR COUNCIL
TO BE A MARATHON
Two Wards to Have Three Can
didate and One Will Have
Four This Spring.
Although the spring election is al
most three months away, candidates
are becoming active. Four members
of the city council will retire April
-I, if they are not re-elected. These
councilmen are: S. E. Blumer, first
ward; Arthur C. Bowman, second;
Clemens C. Hoeller, third, and Wil
liam H. Medley, fourth.
With the exception of Mr. Blumer,
rll have opposition ,and in some .wards
there will be as many as three candi
dates contesting at the elction.
Dr. G. B. Schulz, who is certain to
make the race for Mayor one year
hence, w'll oppose the re-election of
Arthur C. Bowman in the second
ward. Dr. Schulz, his friends say, ex
pects to make a record in the council
that will make him the logical candi
date for Mayor the following year.
Louis Wittmor is also said to be
anxious to represent the second ward
in the city council. His friends say
lie is certain to enter the contest.
Clem Hoeller is certain to encounter
a hard fight, if he decides to run for
re-election. While he has not reveal
ed his plans, he will make the race,
his friends say, if he finds the opposi
tion to him is not too strong. Three
candidates are already in the field
against Hoeller, and each one has a
substantial following. They are: Gus
Stein, William Brunke and Al F. Mau
ler. Stein and Brunke have made the
race before and were well supported.
This will be Mr. Maurer's first cam
paign, but he has a host of friends
who are predicting that he will carry
the ward.
William H. Medley will be opposed
by Tom Gill, a former councilman, in
the fourth ward this spring. It is
possible that another candidate will
participate in this contest, making it
a three-cornered affair.

Farmer Is Buried
Wearing A Hat,
Planned To Do It
Mississippi County Man Kept
Fedora Five Years Head
Rests on Fancy Pillow He
Had Made For Occasion.
Adhering to the wishes expressed
by him several years ago, Green B.
Forest, a Mississippi County farmer,
was buried near Charleston last week,
scaring a hat that he had purchased
for the occasion more than five years
ago. A fancy pillow, that had been
made by Mrs. Forest several years ago
at his request, was placed fn the cas
ket, and when the coffin was lowered
into the grave, his head lay upon the
pillow.
Forest was considered well to do. He
was well liked in his community, but
was known to be somewhat eccentric.
It was about five years ago, his wife
states, that he purchased in Charles
ton a soft black fedora hat, which he
announced was to be a part of his
shroud.
When Mrs. Forest inquired why he
had purchased it, he said he had reach
ed an age when death might come at
any time. H? said he would place the
hat in a box, where it could remain
until he might need it. He then in
duced his wife to make the pillow,
vh:ch he said, he wanted to lie upon
when laid away ih the cemetery.

wishes. She kept it in a trunk for
the several years, and during the past
two years had looked upon her hus
band's uncanny requests more as a
.joke than a serious matter.
"By making preparations to die you
are certain to enjoy good health," Mrs.
Fcrest often remarked to her husband.
whose answer invariably was: "Well.
my time must eventually come and
when it does, I want to buried in that
hat and upon that pillow."
Three weeks ago he became ill and
while his sickness was not looked upon
as being of a serious nature, he grad
ually grew worse. When he was told
that he could not live but a short time,
and asked if he had any arrangements
to make, he summoned his wife to his
bedside and whispered: "I want you
to see that I wear that hat, and I
want you to place that pillow under
my head."
When his body had been prepared
for burial and was ready to be placed
in the casket, Mrs. Forest tucked the
fancy pillow at the head of the coffin,
and had the undertakers to adjust the
black fedora hat upon his head after
he had been placed in the casket.
Most of his friends had often heard
of Mr. Forest's unusual request, and
few were surprised at the unique spec
tacle that met their gaze when they
ttepped forward at the grave to look
upon Mr. Forest for the last time.
