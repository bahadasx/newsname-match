also have their buildings almost

There is .some talk of three of

is hardly expected at this season

Some months ago the Forest
announced the results of
a prelTiiiinaTry antelope census of
Mi w Mexico. A second estlmato
is now announced, based on re
vised data, which places the ante
loe population ot the state at
s.'O head. This ligure, it is stated,
may be considered nearly cor
i eel.
The data on which litis ligure
is based indicates a total of 22
herds, widely scattered ovorall
except the northwestern pnrt of
toe state, where the immense
urea surrounding the "Navajo
ciintry"apK'ars to bu absolutely
cleaned out. The largest herd is
that on the Hell ranch, which C.
M. O'Dono), the manager of the
property, estimates at 200 head.
Tho smallest herd is that of Gran
Quivera, where a little band of
Sve appears to be the sole rem
nant of the thousands which
formerly ranged in the Estnncia
vulley. Three herds, totalling
255 hend, are reported as run
ning mostly on National Forest
land. The rest are on the plains
of tho public domain. The re
iMirts received indicate that 11
out of tlie 22 herds are decreas
ing, while the others are barely
holding their own Not a single
herd is definitely reported as on
tho increase.
