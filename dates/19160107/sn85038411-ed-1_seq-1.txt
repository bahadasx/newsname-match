► CRISIS RAISED BY
PERSIA SINKING
BEFORE CABINET
Devote Meeting to Submarine
Warfare Discussion; Await
ing Full Details
OBTAIN 21 AFFIDAVITS
Survivors Swear "No Warning
Was Given and No
Vessels Seen"
Washington, D. C.. Jan. 7. The
submarine crisis, still of uncertain
status because of lack of details, was
placed by President Wilson before
the cabinet k)-day in its first meeting
since his return from Hot Springs,
Va. The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee also met to consider the
situation but as Chairman Stone was
detained at the White House by a
conference with the President, ad
journed without action.
Altough more than a week has
. passed since the Persia was sunk in
the Mediterranean with the loss of
Americun life, officials were to-day
still uninformed as to whether the
vessel was torpedoed and if so, the
nationality of the submarine and
other details which would determine
the nature of the action the White
House has announced it will take.
Developments continued to-day to in
dicate that the American government
would "withhold action pending offi
cial advices determining these points.
Austria In Ignorance
Over night developments included
1 he receipt of an official dispatch from
Mr. Penfield at Vienna asserting that
the Austrian government was with
out information concerning the Inci
dent up to the night of January 4
and from Consul Garrcls at Alex
andria, Egypt, stating that he had ob
tained affidavits front 21 survivors
and that all confirmed previous state
ments "that no warning was given
and no vessel was seen."
Ambassador Penfield's dispatch
added that Baron Burian, the Aus
trian foreign minister, had asked
what information concerning the in
cident was in possession of the United
States.
Officers and crew of the Persia,
l Consul Garrels reported, have left
A Alexandria for England. Their affi
davits, State Department officials be
lieved would be obtained upon their
arrival there.
Must A wait Facts
As the « abinet assembled it was made
plain that tne members agreed with
the President that in the case of the
Persia nothing can be done until all
the facts were at hand. Some mem
bers expressed the opinion that it
might never be learned whether the
Persia was sunk by a submarine and
if so what nation was responsible.
Regardless of the outcome of the
Persia, however, the majority of the
Cabinet members are represented as
believing that the time has come for
making certain that no further at
tacks on merchant ships carrying
Americans will be made.
Expect l.usitania Settlement
The Persia incident was taken up
only briefly at the cabinet meeting;
because Secretary uansing had no de
finite recommendations to make in the
absence of specific facts regarding the
sinking of the ship. One cabinet mem
ber said that the mention of the for
eign situation at the meeting was
"only superficial."
Secretary I.ansius: said he expected
to confer with Count Von Bernstorff
the German Ambassador later to-dfK
over the Lusitania negotiations. An
early settlement has been indicated.
President and Mrs. Wilson
Will Open Social Season
Washington. Jan. 7. The White
House social season will open to-night
with a reception in honor of the dele
gates to the Pan-American Scientific
Congress. More than 4,000 invitations
have been issued and hundreds have
been refused.
The President and Mrs. Wilson will
receive together in the Blue room, as
sisted by members of the cabinet and
iheir wives. The reception will be the
iirst appearance of Mrs. Wilson at an
affair of the kind.

FURTHER ADVANCE
AGAINST GERMANS
CLAIMED BY RUSS
Take Czertorysk and Now
Threaten Teutonic Strong
hold at Kovel
ARE NOW BALKAN POWER i
Allies in Macedonia Are in
Danger; Domestic Crisis
Concerns British
By Associated Press
London, Jan. 7.—The principal gain
announced for the Russians yesterday
along the Bessarabian frontier was at
Csertorysk, the scene of many sangui
nary struggles, where it is said the
Austrians were driven from the ceme
tery.
Any further advance in this region
will threaten Kovel, one of the strongest
Austro-German positions. It is be
llved that even though no further gain
had been made Russia's forces have
attained a position which will give the
nation a degree of power in Balkan
affairs it has not had since its armies
were driven back from the Carpa
thians.
Allies Still Threatened
The Teutonic allies still threaten to
expel the French and British from
their Macedonian positions, hut no for
ward move has been detected thus far
in that direction. Strong Turkish
forces are said to be concentrating on
the Thracean frontier of Greece and
it is suggested the Turks may attempt
to make good some of the territorial
losses they suffered during the Balkan
wars.
The British public Is still concerned
with the domestic crisis. Notwith
standing the heavy majority for the
compulsion bill on first reading in the
house of commons, the press is specu
lating on the possibility of a break-up
of the political truce with a general
election as the final chapter of the
controversy.
There is no indication in official re
j ports or news dispatches of marked
activity on any of the war fronts ex
cept along the line in the east from j
Volhynia, southward to Bessarabia.:
Even here the fighting between Austro-
German and Russian forces seems to |
have slackened. The mast notable de-1
velopment reported is the driving back'
of the Russians in the neighborhood of,
Czertorysk, Volhynia. Berlin declar
ing' they were expelled front the

State St. Market to Be
Dark Tomorrow Night
The old market house at Fourth and
State streets will be dark to-morrow
night for the first time on market day
in half a century. This property,
which is owned by Mrs. A. R. Shellen
berger, will shortly be taken over by
the State.
The State street market is one of the
oldest In Harrisburg. It was built in
1861. For twenty-five years market,
was held on Tuesday and Friday morn
ings and Saturday nights. When the
other market companies started busi
ness the morning markets were cut
out. When the State street market
was started there was a rule that no
one could begin to sell produce until
signalled to do so by the ringing of a
large bell. The bell was also rung
when sales were to stop. This was
done in order to prevent forestalling
and a combination on prices between
fanners.
HEED ON MURDER CHARGE
Thomas Smith, colored, was held for
court without bail, charged with the
murder of Mrs. Ella Albright, last
June, at a preliminary hearing in the
offices of Alderman Edward J. Hilton,
in Court street, this afternoon. Rob
ert T. Fox, assistant district attorney,
conducted the case. He pleaded "not

Police May Soon Wear
"Keystone" Badges
The keystone from Harrisburg's city
flag may be substituted for the metal
shield badges of the police forco as

The idea, which has followed for
the last several years in New York
and other metropolitan cities, has
been suggested to Mayor Meals by
City Clerk Charles A. Miller. It is
understood that the Mayor has asked
for estimates on sufficient emblems
of the proposed design with a view to
adopting the change.
At present the officers wear a star
in a i-ircle. The keystone would con
vey the State, county and city sug
gestion as parts of the coats of arms
