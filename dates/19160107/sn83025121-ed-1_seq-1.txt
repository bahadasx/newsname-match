(Associated PTess br Federal Wireless.)
WASHINGTON, January 7.
' Tiiat the inadequate' channel

Mare Isiaaii may forca tha abandon
ment of that station, but that the navy
will have on. the Pacific flrstcjass yards
and drydocke, capable of .handling the

repairs, at both Pearl Harbor and' Bre
merton, m is the statement made before
the house committee on ".aval affairs
yesterday, by. Bear Admiral Stanford,
chief of the bureau of doefc and yard.
The committee has taken the "pre
paredness" naval bill, Admiral Stan
ford being: the first to be called before
it for question.
Yard Should Be Closed
"The Mare Island yard should he
closed," said the admiral, "or at least
left out of. consideration so far as any
naval construction work is concern
ed." He believed, however, be said
that there must be an adequate naval
station and yard, in the California
me mat me southern coast ba examin
ed for a possible site for a proper
naval baee. lie stated that Uoat Island
might be found to offer suitable ad
vantages, but said that this was a ten
tative suggestion only.
representative Stephens suggested
that congress should be asked to pro
vide a commission to study the possi
ble locations for a 'great navy yard in
Kan Francisco Day, where one is need
ed, provided the statement that Mare
Island may possibly be abandoned be
acted upon.
Admiral Stanford states that there
are now three yards capable of handling
dreadnought, these being- at New
York, Norfolk and Bremerton. Penrl
Harbor cap be added to this lint as
soon as the work now. under way there
in completed.
Statement A Surprise
The blunt statement of the chief of
the bureau of ards and docks that ns
consideration should be given to Mare
Island in the matter of naval construc
tion came as a surprise, in view of the
fact that Secretary Daniels, three
weeks ago, awarded the contract to
Mare Island for the construction of
one of the two 32,000-ton dreadnoughts
authorized, by the last rongreKs. The
Mare Island bid was $7,41:1,15(1, this
bid and that of the Brooklyn nnvy
yard being the only ones to co.ne with
in the congressional limit of cost. The
other dreadnought is to be built at the
Brooklyn yard.

Jonea Bill Is Basis
Senator Hitchcock, according to the
notification he had given, yesterday
moved that the bill, popularly known
as the Jones Bill, be placet! on the
calendar as unfin'-hed business. There
was o objection and the bill was thus
brought before the senate for final ac
tion. In presenting it, Senator Hitch
cock outlined the progress that had
been. made along the lines of self-government
in the Philippines and urged
the bill as opening the r-ay for further
progress, with ultimate independence
for the Filipinos to spur them on in
their efforts.
Folds Out A Promise
Sonator Cummins took exception to
the wording of the preamble, which
promises independence U the Philip
pines "when such ia in the best inter
ests" of the Islands. He declared that
this, was holding out' a promise to the
Filipinos which the bill did not bind
any fnture eongreea o fulfill.
Senator Borah voiced a like objection

(Associated Prese by Tederal Wireless.)
WASHINGTON, January 7. That
each country la the Western Hemisphere
hold itself responsible for the welfare
and safety of the others was the gist
of . the plan proposed by President Wil
son in his address tn the delegates to
the Pan-Ameriaii Congress in session
here last night.
The President, in oening his re
marks, referred to the proposals made
the day before by Secretary of State
Lansing, as "a basis upon which the
countries of America can work for in
ternational domestic peace throughont
the whole of North and South Amer
ica." Proposes Binding Pact
Continuing, the President said that
be had to propose that each nation
represented each country in the two
Americasunite in guaranteeing the
political independence and the territo
rial integrity of all the others. Farthe
more, added the speaker, he would have
one and all enter into an agreement to
settle all boundary disputes immediately
and on a friendly basis, and agree to
arbitrate all such disputes which might
arise in the future.
Another thing the President urged
was the need for av agreement among
the nations of the Americas not to per
mit the outfitting of revolutions against
the governments of any of the) others.
Such an agreement, Mr. Wilson pointed
out, would go far toward increasing the
stability of all the governments.

"la the past," Mr. Wilson said.
"there has been a feeling on the part of
