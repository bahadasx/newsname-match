DETAILS OF NAVAL FIGHT.
Lifted Censorship at Rome Permits of
Description of Durazzo Engagement.
Rome, Jan. 6.—The censorship hav
ing been lifted tonight, it is now possi
ble to give details of the naval en
gagement off Durazzo, Albania, on
Dec. 29, in which the Austrian de
stroyers Triglav and Lika were sunk.
For several days an Austrian aeroplane
had been flying over Durazzo, making
observations and occasionally dropping
bombs. At 7 a. m. of the 29th, an
Austrian squadron, composed of five
destroyers and the cruiser Helgoland
entered the harbor at full speed.
As the warships approached they
opened fire on a Greek steamer which
had put in for repairs. No warning
was given of the attack, and the as
sertion is made that the sailors oi»
board were fired on even after they
left the vessel and were attempting to
reach shore. The Austrian also bom
barded and sank several sailing boats
and then attacked the encampment
of entente troops.
An attempt was made by the Aus
trlans to land a detachment of men
with incendiary bombs to set Are to
the customs warehouse but an Italian
battery prevented the landing.
The Italian squadron arrived and
opened fire on the Austrian warships.
The Lika, the flagship, was struck by
a torpedo and sank after her magazine
had blown up. Most of the crew of
about 100, including Commander Vin
cer, were drowned.
The Trlsrlnv wng struck and th pn
taken in tow by two of the other de
stroyers. They were compelled to
abandon her outside the harbor, how
ever, and she was sunk by the pursing
Italians quadron.
Says Italy Sold Out.
Berlin, wireless to Sayville, Jan. 7.—
The Naue Zuricher Zeitung has re
ceived reports from reliable sources,"
says the Overseas News Agency, "that
the London treaty providing against
conclusions of a separate peace signed
by Italy contains a special clause under I
which Italy received 2,000,000,000 lire
for giving her adherence to the agree
ment."
The news agency said "it has special
information" that another clause In
the treaty is directed against the
Vatican.

NEW HAVEN CASE
GIVEN TO JURY
j-
Trial of William Rockefeller and Ten
Other Former Railroad Directors,
For Alleged Conspiracy, Is Con
eluded.
New Tprk, Jatt. 7.—/The case against
William Rockefeller and ten other for
mer directors of the New York, New
Haven & Hartford railroad, charged
with criminal conspiracy under the
Sherman law, was submitted to the
Jury today.
The eleven former directors, who
have been on trial for nearly three
months, charged^ with criminal viola
tion of the Sherman anti-trust law, ex
pect to know their fate today.
All that remained before the final
submission of the case to the jury was
the delivery this forenoon of Judge
Hunt's charge. This was expected to
occupy at least two hours.
William Rockefeller was the only de
fendant not in court when Judge Hunt
began his remarks. The charge against
the defendants' being a misdemeanor
his presence was not legally required.
The court first instructed the Jury
that the case should be considered
without regard to any testimony that
would indicate an attempt to influence
legislation by bribeiy or corrupt
means. The indictment contained no
such chhrge, }ie said.
Discussing the Sherman act, he said
that it did not prescribe a limit to'ac
cusations and that large enterprises
may ln a certain sense be permitted to'
monopolize commerce. Magnitude of
business men was jyt in. itself a viola
of a law.

Collector Malone's report, on. the Ital

at New York yesterday with two guns
mounted, was received today by the
treasury department and forwarded to
the state department without being
made public.
It is understood the neutrality in
vestigators reported that there" were no
Italian naval gunners aboard and all
members of the crew were regularly so.
It is understood the presence of the
guns is held not to alter the Verdi's
character as a merchantman. This
opinion, however, is not binding' on the

to look with disfavor upon, any'mer

Germany Refuses to Admit Wrong Do

Act of Reprisal For British Blockade
of North Sea Agrees to Instruct
Submarine Commanders to Give
Warning Before Sinking Vessels.
Washington, Jan. 7.—Proposals by
the German government which will
end the controversy over the Lusi
tania disaster in a manner satisfactory
to the United States, were understood
to have- been received here from Berlin.
Count von Bernstorff had an ap
pointment to confer with Secretary
Lansing this afternoon.
Germany is still to have agreed to
pay an indemnity for American lives
lost at the same time basing a reser
vation of any wrongdoing on the con
tention that the destruction of the ves
sel was an act of reprisal and retalia
tion for the British blockade of Ger
many.
To Give Warning of Attacks.
Germany is also understood to be
ready to give assurances that her sub
marine commanders operating in the
Mediterranean will be Instructed not
to attack without warning privately
owned vessels of any description, in
cluding riners, freighters and tramp
steamers.
German assurances regarding sub
marine warfare in the North sea in
clude only liners ln passenger service.
Objects to Muzzling Program.
Secretary Daniels' recent refusal to
permit Rear Admiral Knight or Rear
Admiral Fiske to speak in Chicago on
the navy program was made the basis
today of a request by Representative
Britten, republican, of Illinois, before
the house naval committee, that action
be taken to prevent any attempt on
the pail*-'of "the secretary "to muzzle
naval, officers appearing before the
naval' committee ot t& assign officers
to distant posts beyond the practical
reach of the committee."
•Democratic members challenged the
basis for the information and Mr.
Britten replied that Admiral Fiske had
been granted thirty days' leave on
condition that he not talk or write on
preparedness.
Holds Embargo Unneutral.
Representative Gardner, republican,
made a long prepared speech in the
house today on the war condition in
volving the United States. He ap
proved the administration's stand that
it would be unneutral to embargo war
munitions and declared that peace in
Europe now would be inconclusive and
would mean another war.
He assailed the pacificists, the
hyphenated Americans and the cotton
interests.
Interferenoe With Mails.
Investigation of foreign interference
with United States mails In the high
seas or en route to destinations is con
templated in a resolution introduced by
Senator Hitchcock, of Nebraska, call
ing on Postmaster General Burleson to
supply the senate with all Information
in his possession bearing on the sub
ject.
Sugar Fight Opens.
The first step in the administration's
legislative plan to postpone placing
sugar on the free list was taken to
day in the introduction of a joint reso
lution by Senator Broussard, democrat,
of Louisiana, providing for the suspen
sion of the tariff law provision, which
would admit sugar without duty May
1, next. The resolution went to the
senate finance committee.
German Communication Withheld.
It- was stated with authority today
that Germany virtually agreed with the
positipn of the United States, with re
gard to small boats not being, under
all conditions, places of safety for
passengers aboard a ship about to be
destroyed. These latest concessions
were contained In the last note from
Germany regarding the sinking of the
Ship William P. Frye. The communi
cation reached the state department
several weeks ago but was withheld
from the public. Germany is under
stood to have fully agreed with the
American point of view.
The assurances regarding the con
duct of submarine warfare in the
Mediterranean convey the first Infor
mation that German submarines were
operating there.
Excluding all ships except liners
from assurances covering submarine
warfare in the North sea, the German
government was represented as con
rig* that no Aniericar.s could pos
slbly be aboard ships oth*er than Hners.
Bernstorff Obtained .Concessions.
It has been known for some time that
Coupt von Bernstorff had devised a
plan'which he believed would satis
factorily settle the Lusitania contro
versy. .He was understood to have
submitted the proposal to the Berlin
foreign-office before Christmas. There
was some delay, attributed to the dis
missal of the German naval and mili
tary attache and" the demands ln the
first American note to Austria on the
sinking of the Ancona.
As for' thp -disavowal asked by the
Uijited'States, the German government
was represented as considering the
most effective form of disavowal was
assurance theft such acts would, not be
countenanced in the future. ?.)•?

sinking Greek steamer Thessalonikl

the supply of meat on the Thessalonikl
was entirely exhausted, only a few 131)
gallons of water were left, and tha
ship's officers began to portion n»t
short rations of the meager supply of
food whloh remained.
The captain of the vessel repeatedly
refused to send out wireless calls fo»
aid at the request of both crew and
passengers, according to William Wil
liams, a naturalized citizen of tha
United States. Williams aald:
"Tho Thessalonikl left P&lratts Ntev.

came up and the first tho passengers
knew there was anything amiss waa
when all the crew was ordered below
to work on something which had gone
wrong. Many passengers became
alarmed and on Dec. tz, when the Ital
lon liner Stampalla was sighted, sev
eral of them went to the captain and
asked that they be transferred. He
assured them that everything was all
right and that they would arrived ia
New "York on time.
Refused to Ask Aid.
"The storm lasted more than twa»a
hours. On Dec. 26 another storm
came
up, One of the lifeboats was earrted
away. Several passengers aaK
bers of the crew again went to the
captain and asked ta&i xmiie by wipe
less for aid be sent out. He waa in
dignant, saying he was running tha
ship and knew his business^ and re*
fused to send out any call.
"Later all the officers and crew, ex
cept the first engineer and two sailors
demanded that the captain send out
messages. He refused and the first
officer then sent out the calls.
"When the Florizel appeared on Fri
day, we were living on short rations
and a half a cup of water a day. We
had had no meat for two weeks, altho
there were vegetables and bread.
Iowa Priest Quiets Passengere.
"When the Patris came up on Deo.
SI, the captain and a few men went ta
the other ship. They brought back ten
casks of water and a supply of meat.
All this time the vessel was leaking
badly but the captain seemed deter
mined to take his ship and passengers
to New York.
"On New Year's day, however, he
gave up hope and the passengers were
transferred to the Patris. There was
much trouble among the steerage pas
sengers when they learned that the
ship was leaking, but a Greek priest
Kallistratos Glavas, of Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, went among them and stayed
until they were transferred. He quieted
them and held services much of the
time."
