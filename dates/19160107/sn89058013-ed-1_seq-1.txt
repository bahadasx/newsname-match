CAMDEN VISITED BY
DSASTROUS
DRY. GOODS STORE AND LIVERY
: STABLE BURN SUNDAY NIGHT
A serious fire occurred here last
Sunday night or rather Monday
morning about 2 o'clock when the
dry goods store of G, F. Garner &
Son and the livery stable" of Over
field & McDaniel were destroyed.
The fire originated in GaruePs
Btore, which was formerly occupied
by C. R. Fiuley on the southwest
corner of court square. : 1
We learn from those who were
first on the ground when the fire
was discovered that the rear end
of the store was in flames. Look
ing through the grating of the
basement they saw fire dropping
through the floor where the stove
stood. 0. O. Hubbsj-one of the
salesmen,, arrived on the scene
just after the front door of the
store had been opened, tut the
heat drove him back. Grover Gar-
ner, manager ofthe company, at
tempted to recover his books and
was singed before he 'had. hardly
reaehed the inside of the door.
The building occupied by the
Messrs, Garner was owned by T.
W. Saunders of Cooley's Landing,
and his niece, Mrs. A. N. McKel
vey, of Huntingdon owned . the
livery barn.- They carried no in-
insurance. Both buildings were
made of concrete. .The Messrs.
Garner had their, stock of . mer
chandise insured for $6,000. The
stock was valued at $10,000. - Mr.
Saunders, we understand, will re
build again. His loss is estimated
at $5,000. The livery barn was
valued at $2,500. . - :;; ;.
IN HARD LUCK.
' An era of hard luck seems to
have overtaken the C Nashville,
Chattanooga and St. ; Louis Rail,
way,' The destructive accident at
Kingston Springs was followed by
the head-end collision near Chat
tanooga in which twelve lives were
lost and much property destroyed.
? A freight train was derailed in
the yards at Hollow Rock Junction
week before last, and then another
wreck at Hico Friday.. It seems,'
with one excepiicnt thse wrecks
have been due to spreading: rails
and weak trestles. ,-:: 'rH-y'
The N., C. and St. L. has been
very fortunate in this respect here
tofore, for the company has had
few wrecks, and if we mistake not,
not a passenger has been killed on 1
the road in the past fifty years. :

manac is by far the finest, largest
and best ever before printed. The
Hicks storm and weather forecasts

truth aud value, and this Splendid

R Hicks Magazine, Word and
Works,, and his unique almanae
should al ways go . together, both
for only one dollar,a year. The
Almauac alone is 35 cents prepafd.

FIRE
- The Cumberland Telephone and
Telephone Co. occupuid two rooms
on the second floor of the Saun-
ders Building. The? household
effects of Mr. Saunders were also
stored in rooms on th ) some floor.
The loss here was complete, as it
was impossible to gain admission
to any part of the building. The
wareroom of- the Mi;. C. Bowles
Hardware Co. nearby had a nar
row escape. The building was not
injured seriously, but w car of wire
fencing was somewhat damaged
by faling walls.''':. i;r '.t';:
The Cumberland peoplesuffeied
a loss of several thou.iand dollars.
Tbey were on the sceiie early, and
made arrangements at once to open
au exchange in the First National
Bank Building, but it will be a few
days before telephon i aud tele
graph service is fully restored.
Overfield & McDanie) place their
loss at about $250. . They saved
all their horses, rolling stock, hay,,
etc., but lost some corn, etc.
The blacksmith shop of F. E.
McElyea, which fc iij the same
block, has weathered fieveral fires,
and though a little disigured, it is
still intact and. ready 'for use. It
is more than likely the livery barn
would have escaped il: it had not
been for the falling trails of the
Saunders Building. Fit seemed
t'tat when the concrete blocks were
a' littlewarni the walls went to
pieces. It was blocks from the
livery barn that damaged the shop
of Mr. McElyea. !
