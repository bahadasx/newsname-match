Action Misunderstood.
An English "Tommy," while sta
tioned in a Flemish village, wanted to
buy a toothbrush. Being unable to
speak either French or Flemish he
could not manage to make the people
understand what he wanted. After
several unsuccessful attempts, he hit
on a brilliant idea and, entering a little
shop, he proceeded to imitate the ac
tion of brushing his teeth.
At first the old dame shook her head,
then her face suddenly lit up with a
smile. Placing a ladder against the
'wall, she searched several minutes in
some cardboard boxes on a top shelf.
She at last found what she wanted and
triumphantly handed him, not a tooth
brush, bat a jew's-harp!
