MOVEMENT, AND WILL DO ALL
HE CAN TO HELP.

NOTHING BUT TRANSPORTATION
FACILITIES LACKING TO OPEN
BIGGEST FIELD OF THE KIND IN
THE UNITED STATES.
A Schneider of New York City is
here looking alter his asphalt inter
ests. He has large holdings of asphalt
lands near Woodford and is Interest
ed in transportation that he may get
!iis product to market. Mr. Schueldi'r
says the problem ef transportation is
the only problem to he solved to make
the asphalt mines and the town of
Woodford one of the busiest Industrial
places In tin- union. He says the
amount of asphalt there Is so large
that it can scarcely be estimated, the
many uses of asphalt are known and
there is a sharp demand for the prod
uct. Hi; says one roofing concern
alone otters to take twenty thousand
tuns a year. Mr. Schneider sent a bar
rel of it to a chemist in Germany some
years ago. The chemist asked for five
more and they were; sent. The next
nriler was for twemty barrels, and the
next for a full car. Mr. Schneider is
thoroughly of the opinion that the
iiuality of the Woodford asphalt is
sufficient to give it a place in all the
markets of the world and lie is anxious
to seo some means of transportation
provided. He is negotiating with a
railway company now to build a line
to Woodford. A short line of road
from Ardmore to Woodford ought to
he a paying proposition. Kvery engi
neer who has ever passed upon the
matter, states that the tonnage is suf
ficient to justify the building of a road,
and the Rock Island at one time would
have built the spur to Wood word if
the commercial department of the road
had not made an adverse report ns to
the market for the output, and If he
can convince a railway company that
lie can do so, ho can induce the build
ing of the road.

COURT OF INQUIRY DEFERRED
UNTIL NEXT TUESDAY ON AC
COUNT OF ILLNESS OF JUDGE
FREEMAN.
On account of illness, Judge Free
man has adjourned his court of In
quiry that is probing1 into conditions
in the oil fields, until next Tuesday,
when all witnesses have been warned
to reappear and give their testimony.
The iimrt was In session all day
yesterday, but nothing has been di
vulged as to what was accomplislie'd.
It has been reported that there has
been a general exodus from Ragtown
by the "sports" w ho w ere respon
sible for the present investigation,
but they would have to go but a few
yards to be out of the county and
beyond ttio jurisdiction of the court
here. It is said, however, that the
authorities of Stephens and Jeffer
son counties are preparing to put on
the lid, as well as this county, and if
that is t lie case, the knights of the
green cloth and the vendors of "big
pipe," "little pipe" booze, and casing
head gas will have to search for oth
er fields of endeavor..
"Ragtown Is no better and no worse
than any other oil field town," re
marked an operator who has follow
ed the game for a number of years.
"The tough element will gradually be
eliminated, but the workers are a
hard bunch to control, and it Is hard
ly possible to legislate them Into be
ing good. Ragtown Is a paradise,
even at that, to some other recently
developed fields In the state, and t
have been in all of thtm."
Yesterday afterneon one witness
refused to give testimony to the court
and was remanded to the county jail
where he might think the matter
over for
few hour.
