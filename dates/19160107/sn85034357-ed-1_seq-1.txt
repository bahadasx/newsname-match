'Tazewell County i
Importance
Enthusiastic Meeting is Held
the Court House, and I'lans
Being Made For Rnisin?
Money for the Work.
From the general assent given to
proposed road improvement in the
meeting held in the court house last
Monday afternoon, it is evident that
the people of the county are wide a
wake to the importance of road build?
ing in this county as they have never
been before.
On previous occasions when road
meetings were held, things were not
as pleasant as they might have been,
but there was not the slightest op?
position to the proposed improve?
ments in the roads. The plan is to
make a slight increase in taxes, and
raise the money as it is needed in
(hat way, or in other words, adopt
the "Pay as you go" plan fur future
road building in the county. This!
plan will be adopted for connect?
ing with the road in McDowell and !
other improvements suggested.
The meeting was organized by the I
election of Supervisor D. B. Daniels |
as chairman of the meeting, and \V.
G. O'Brien, secretary.
-. Mr. Daniels stated that the object
of the meeting was to discuss road
maintainance, and to build more roads
while muintaining those already built.
Mr. Daniels stated that Governor H.
C. Stuart has outlined a policy for
road maintenance, which he will pre?
sent to the legislature this winter.
His plan is for the counties to se-1
cure convicts to keep up the roads.
This matter will be thoroughly dis?
cussed and some definite course of I
action decided upon at a State road |
meeting to be held in Richmond on
the 18th inst., to which meeting a
number of delegates have been ap?
pointed from this county. The con?
clusions of this meeting in Richmond
will be submitted to the legislature
and laws asked for that will enable
the counties to secure the convicts for
road maintenance work.
Supervisor E. K. Crockett spoke of I
the needs of his district, outlining
certain roads that should be built and
certain gaps that should be closed up.
Supervisor Burke, of Maiden Spring I
district, also expressed himself as |
to what he exepected.
County road engineer Martin out?
lined n plan that if adopted, will con?
nect up all the principal roads of the |
county.
Attorney R. O. Crockett endorsed
the plan of road building as outlined
by Mr. Martin, and said: "If we have
another bond issue for building roads
I would rather have Mr. Martin
sole charge of the work than have the I
work turned over to the State High- |
way commission. Mr. Martin is build?
ing roads, and building them cheaply, I
and thoroughly. I suggest the repeal
of the act in reference to Tazewcll
county, and let Tnzewell people hnn-J
die their own funds."
/ On motion of Dr. Isaac Peirce, a
committee, consisting of seven citi?
zens from each Magisterial district, j
was appointed to meet here Saturday
and arrange for some definite course
to be persued in reference to another
bond issue, exactly where the money
is to be spent, and other dtails. The
Supervisors are members of this com?
mittee:
The personnel of the committee is |
as follows:
Jeffersonville District.
R. O. Crockott, W. L. Moore, J. Ed. |
Peery, Alex Beavers, W. T. Corell, J.
P. Litx, and R. P. Buchanan.
Clear Fork District.
Frank Moss, Dr. J. R. Hicks, H. S.
Bowen, 0. B. Moore, Isaiah Harry, W.

Maiden Spring District.
E. H. Scott, W. B. F. White, J. G.
Barns, John Hilt, D. C. Lowe, Dr. W.
Ei Baylor, W. B. Steele.
This committee will meet here to?
morrow, and make nil arrangements
for presentation at the meeting to be
held Monday of facts and figures.
The meeting to be held, at which all
road advocates are urged to attend,
ill recommend to the delegates to
Richmond convention what they
^n the way of legislation, etc.,
session of the legislature
;s in Richmond this winter.
Stock Meeting,
neeting of the farmers was held
in the court house Monday during
which the question of improving and
conecting up the county roads was
discussed.
After the good roads meeting was
over, plans for the improvement of
the live stock were brought forth.. It
was decided that a stock company be
formed, making the shares worth ^10
each. The stock subscribed will be
used to purchase purebred bulls. The
bulla will be placed among various
stockholders in the county. Stock?
holders will be allowed to breed one
cow free of charge for each sharo of
Btock held, otherwise service lees
will be charged. _
Several ofttnrTlferi present were
very enthusiastic over the improve?
ment of the stock, and each took a
number of shares in the company.
This will be a good thing for every
cattle man and cow owner in the
county, and should receive their beat
interest and support.
When a sufficient number of men
ave been enrolled they will be
rought together to adopt a constitu
ion and by-laws.

Preachers Arc Not Forgotten.
On Thursday before Christmas the
dood people of Mt. Olivet and Con

[hings for Christmas.
We enjoyed the tokens of love from

Jurke's Garden Pastor Subjected to j
Similar Treatment.
On the night of December 22nd, I
the young people of Burkc's Garden
completely surprised the family of |
Rev. R. Homer Anderson, the Luth?
eran pastor, with a most liberal poun?
ding. They met at a central point in
the Garden, from which place they
went to the parsonage in automobiles
and buggies. To mention the things
they brought as an expression of
Christmas cheer and goodwill would |
make too long a list. Perhaps the 18
pound turkey and the large Christmas
cake should be mentioned. The best
of everything Burkes Gnrden pro?
duces to eat- was left in large quanti?
ties. No longer is the "larder lean."
The parsonage was gladly turned
over to the young people for the ev?
ening. They served hot chocolate
and cakes and spent a good social
hour. The young people of the com?
munity organized themselves into a
"Young Peoples Society" a few
months ago at Central church, and
are now doing atcive work under the
guidance of their gifted leader. But
here wo are concerned with the
"pounding." R. H. A.
SAYS HE PASSED BAD CHECK.
Man Surrenders in St. Louis, Saying |
He is Wanted Here.
The following appeared in a St. |
Louis paper recently:
"A man who said he is George Mitch?
ell, 22 years old, of Asbury, Va., I
walked into Central Police station
yesterday and said he is wanted in |
Tazewcll, Va., for passing a bad check
for $135.
"Mitchell said he formerly lived in
Tazewcll and had passsd the check on
E. V. Ellis January 5, 1912. Mitchell,
vwho gave no reason for giving him
plf up, is held pending advices from
izewell."
The authorities in Tazewell were I
a Ivised of the surrender of Mitchell |
ti the Missouri authorities, and ad
\ised them that the charge against
Mitchell would not justify the cost of
extradition and railroad fare. It is
presumed that Mitchell was released

to place in the museum, should leave
