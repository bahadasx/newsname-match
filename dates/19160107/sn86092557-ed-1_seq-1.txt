a joke Tts failure in Norway has
given it the dignity of pathos.
With bands playing, flags flying,
Christmas trees topping every mast,
tho Oscar II sailed into Christiania,
gayly confident of a sympathetic wel
come.
Instoad, two students came aboard
to welcome the American students.
As Mr. Ford walked down the gang
plank only a few guides and fraeight'
handlers stood about the wharf. In
the cold, gray, 10 o'clock dawn of a
Norwegian morning, all the fights
among delegates, newspapermen and
students subsided. The test of the
Ford idea was at hand!
If translations from the Norwegian
press have been as carefully select
ed for him as the translation fur
nished to delegates by the Ford office
administration, he will believe, with
tho delegates, that there is some
hope of making headway against the
opposition here.
Norway, according to Prof. Wilhelm
Kielhau of the University of Chris
tiani, is opposed to anything which
will bring an unnatural termination to
the war. Norwegians believe that
peace, before the belligerents are ex
hausted, would mean renewed hostili
ties as soon as a pause gave one side
or the other a chance partially to re
cuperate.
Like all smaller kingdoms, the
Scandinavian countries are safer
when1 the big powers are engaged in
fighting each other. Also, Norway
will not support any international dis
armament proposition which would
seem to place the greater powers in

Room Occupied by Jeweler
Feaster Has Been
Leased.
A deal was closed yesterday in this
city, whereby the firm of S. J. Court
ney & Son leased from tho Skinner
heirs the store room adjacent to their
present place of business, recently va
cated by the Feaster jewelry store, and
they will in the very near future occu
py the same in connection with their
present location.
The acquisition of this store room
will give tho Courtneys 1800 additional
square feet of floor space which doub
les the floor space new occupied by
tho firm.
The work of remodeling the new
store as well as tho old one, will be
gin at once, and ? according to con
tract, will be completed by February
10. Tho brick wall separating tho two
rooms will be torn down and access
from the new room to the old will be
made by means of two large arches.
A new and modern front correspond
ing to tho one In the old building will
bo installed. The new room will con
tain fitting rooms, corset rooms, offi
ces and a French room, wliero tho
highest grades of millinery will be on
display, besides shelving, cases for
ready-to-wear garments, etc.
The rooms will bo fitted up In cor
responding style. Mission equipment
and furniture to bo used through the
entire structure, ana carpets to cor
respond. A new electric lighting sys
tem will be installed, consisting of the
latest and most modern fittings. The
chandeliers will be acorn shaped to
hnng from the celling by means of
brass chains and to be capable of talc
ing 500 watt lamps. Several changes
will be made in the old building.
The work of tearing out the walls
and rebuilding and remodelling will
bo In the hands of T. L. Burchinal, &
local contractor, while Dayton L. My
ers will Install the electric equipment.
All will be done under the supervision
of T. M. Courtney, the Junior mem
ber of the firm, who has conslderabe
experience in structural iron work
and construction work of all kinds.
The Courtneys came to Fairmont
irom Cleveland, Ohio, nine years ago
in March, and opened up a woman's
store in the room now occupied. The
business has grown to such propor
tions during the nine years, that on
several occasions more room has been
sought, but without success, until at
this time when the idea of securing
the room adjacent to tho present
room was conceived and "the room se
cured.
During,tho nine years the store has
been established in Fairmont, the pat
ronage has steadily grown, until the
firm does an enviable business and has
among its customers representative
people of the city and surrounding
country.
The business of the Courtney flrn>
considerably moro than doubled this
December over that of the preceding
.December and prospects, are that the
business will keep on m this way lor
time to come. ... .

Health Department Says
Most of Them are Full of
^_-Disease_Germs^
. f?
"The old oaken bucket the moss cov
ered bucliet that hung In the well,"
-about which the poet sings, will soon
be a thing of the past In Fairmont It
the plans of the city health depart
ment for the coming year are carried
out f?
"Back on the farm," to quote from
a popular song, the-well or spring was
usually sanitary and afforded a supply
of pure water for the old homestead
becausse there were few houses In the
vicinity.
But in a city where the streets are
lined with houses many of which are
occupied by foreigners and others who
pay little heed to cleanliness, to safe
guard the public from disease it is nec
essary to bring water for domestic
purposes from distant sources, to puri
fy It by artificial means and to pro
tect it from contamination by iron
pipes.
In Fairmont the city water is rid
of disease breeding germs by the use
of chlorine gas, a plant for this pur
pose having been in operation for near
ly two months with-very satisfactory
results, according to the report of the
city health department for last year.
handed to Mayor Anthony Bowen By
Dr. C. M-. Ramage, cltw health officer,
yesterday. A number of wells and
springs still In use In Fairmont, how
ever, according to the department of
health threaten to be sources of epi
demics of typhoid fever and other con
tagious diseases. The portion of the
report of the health department re
garding wells and springs follows:
"The-examination of 20 wells and
springs in the city of Ftairmont dur
ing the past year haB. revealed the
fact that four-fifths or 80 per cent, of
them are polluted and unfit for use
without boiling. the water. This Is
found to be true In all wells in old
settled communities. It has been im
possible heretofore to condemn wells
found to be polluted for the simple rea
son that we could not guarantee the
city water supply, but now when wells
are found to be unfit for use they will
be promptly condemned." -
In describing the effect of chlorine
gas used In-purifying the city -water
the health report says:
"This system briefly, Is an apparatus
which injects into the water beforo
It goes Into the pump at the pump sta
tion, a solution of chlorine gas. This
gas is powerfully disinfectant, killing
immediately all the disease produc
ing organisms and bacteria In. the wa
ter, forming Insoluble chlorides and
chlorates which sediment. Any chlor
ine which is not bound beforo the wa
ter reaches the reservoir escapes -Into
the air. Therefore the only effects, on
the watr ar good and beneficial ones.
This system is approved by the United
States government, by the cities of
Detroit, New York, Philadelphia, Chi
cago and'others.
'.'The greatest capacity of the ap
paratus Is not sufficient to make the
water injurious to metals or the health
of people drinking it. The first cost
of Installation was ^about J700 and
the yearly maintenance will be about
1300. Now the department of health
will know that - when typhoid fever
develops- the . city water, cannot' be
the cause"..The cause' theretarb will be
flratifroni-wells or springs."
