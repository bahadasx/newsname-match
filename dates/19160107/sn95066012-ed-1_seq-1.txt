Distinguished Guests at Annual
Dinner of County Sportsmen
WARWICK CARPENTER PRESIDES
Remarkable Moving Picture Made
by New York Commissioner
George H. Pratt Shown
Ninety-six members und quests at
tended the annual banquet of the
Bennington County Forest, Fish and
Gatne association held Thursday eve
ning at Apollo hall. Through the
courtesy of the association president
Warwick S. Carpenter, a quarter tl
moose meat hud lioen provided as t he
piece de reslstence of an excellent
menu and the postprandial exercises
were graced by the presence of two
national figures in the work of con
servation, George 11. l'ratt, the New
York conservation commissioner,
and John W. Titcoinb, fish and game
commissioner for the state of Ver
mont. Ever since the llennington county
organization became firmly establish
ed it has been the custom to hold at
least one gathering during the year.
The meetings have all been enjoyable
and more or less profitable, but the
banquet Thursday evening iu every
respect eclipsed all previous efforts.
The spirit of good fellowship that has
always characterized the meetings
was even more in evidence, the Inter
est was keein-r and the applause
which greeted tho speakers was
marked by enthusiasm which must
have been highly appreciated.
Added interest was created by an
entirely new feature, the moving pic
tures and views provided by Commis
sioner l'ratt and his assistant, Mr.
Carpenter. Both views and movies
depleted some of the different lines
of work that are being carried on in
New Yorlc and were convincing addi
tions to the word pictures of the
speakers.
Beside each plate was a postcard
wiih a little verse by Commissioner
Pratt which read as follows:
"Only a man in a forest green.
Only a match that was dropped
unseen,
Only a flame some leaves and wood
Only a waste where the forest
stood."
These few lines were the keynote
of the remarks made by both the com
missioner and his assistant. The an!
nual destruction of standing timber
in New York, as in other states, is
enormous. Nearly all of it is due to
the carelessness of campers, hunters
and fishermen and the commissioner
has inaugurated an extensive cam
paign of education to prevent the
loss.
President Carpenter presided as
toastmaster in that happy and effici
ent manner that has been in evidence
at previous banquets during the years
that he has been at the head of the
association. The festivities were giv
en a fine start by the leading by Wil
liam II. Nichols of an original poem
written by James Kyan of Hoosick
Falls in acknowledging the receipt of
a fishing rod made to order by James
If. McGurk of this village.
Commissioner Titcoiub was the
first speaker and the round of ap
plause with which lie was greeted
must have convinced him that he is
always a welcome guest or Benning
ton sportsmen. lie spoke as follows:
The last time I had the honor of
addressing the members of the As
sociation about two years ago I
bad for my topic: "The Intrinsic
Value of the Fish, Game and Fur
hearing Animals Annually Taken in
the State," and showed that at most
conservative calculations it amounted
to over a half million dollars or an
annual dividend on Vermont's wild
life assets capitalized at $12,500,
000.00 if we take the usual savings
bank rate of interest of 4 per cent, as
a basis.
This year, there has been a falling
off in the dividend of fur-bearing
animals, offset by the largest killing
of deer in the history of at least the
past fifty years. It is doubtful if
there Is another State which in pro
portion to Its area can show such a
deer crop as was harvested this past
open season of eighteen days.

I am wondering if Coin'r Pratt, who
honors us with his presence tonight,
can select any block of less than
10,000 square miles in the Empire
State which yielded as many as (HKlfi
deer during any 18 days of the past
open season in that State.
Of the deer reported In to my oflice,
117 weighed 250 lbs. to 420 lbs. and in
most Instances these weights were
verified. There t were X36 deer re
ported at weights less than 100 lbs.
Probably the actual number of deer
weighing less than a hundred pounds
was much larger as reporters are apt
to over-estimate in weight.
I believe it is conservative to
figure the average weight tit 125 lbs.
which means the harvesting of at
least 750,000 lbs. of venison or more
than 2 lbs. for each man, woman and
child in the State. At the beef price
oOc per pound, it means JC7.5O0.0O
worth of venison.
1 have not spoken boastfully of the
large deer crop It is probably the
lurgest ever to be recorded in Ver
mont unless the legislature adopts a
policy of extermination but it dem
onstrates what can be accomplished
iu breeding deer and it partially
answers those who say that the game
laws are not enforced.
In the enforcement of the deer law,
the section protecting fawns was
found . impractiuable. Few fawns re
tain the distinct markings of a fawn
so lute in the ieason as the middle
of November and efforts to prosecute
persons who killed fawns weighing
from forty to sixy pounds were una
vailing. In other words, no jury
would penalize the hunter who killed
a fawn when there was no external
mark to distinguish it from a yearl
ing except its weight. It is thought
that at least 300 fawns were killed
and as many of hern actually weighed
up to one hundred pounds each, it
would not be turprising if we hud
drawn on our future resources to the
number of one thousand fawns.
The legalizing of the killing of does
for one season was expedient. Agri
culture is of first importance in Ver
mont and the efforts of horticultur
ists to establish large orchards here
must not be discouraged. Most of
you are doubtless familiar with the
depredations of deer in young or
chaids. It may be deemed by the
legislature expedient to authorize the
Commissioner to establish zones iu
the vicinity of newly planted
orchards where deer hunting will be
permitted uai'er proper restrict ions
at other periods than the regular
open seasons. Without legislative
action the law lor next season per
mits the killing of bucks only and. as
the bucks must have horns at least
three Inches long, fawns of both
sexes are protected. !
I have been requested to explain
our transportation laws for wild
game. A humor with a non-resident
license may take home with him a
day's bag of game of any or all kinds
Including a deer. A resident hunter
may transport or :hlp to any point
within the State ft day's bag of any
or all kinds of game or a deer, but he
cannot ship any wild game, including
deer, across the boundary into anoth
er State. The object of this provis
ion is to prevent market hunting and
it is especially applicable in refer
ence to deer.
Deer hunters are not necessarily
sportsmen. Many of them aro after
the meat only. Some of them would
go after a herd of cattle in a back
pasture with the 'same zeal if they
could obtain a license to shoot and
take home a fat cow or steer. If
such men can market the deer outside
the State the temptation to kill more
than the limit will be too much for
some of them.
The multiplication of the State's
herd cf deer from 27 introduced iu
1S78 to the thousands in our forests
today, and that notwithstanding the
annual harvest of tho last eighteen
years, suggests what may be accom
plished on private ranges when prop
erly fenced. The fencing of unpro
ductive areas of recently lumbered
forests should make such lands pro
ductive while the new forest is grow
ing and the cost of fencing Is the on
ly important expense.
The leasing of wild and unproduc
tive lands by Clubs for a nominal
sum and the maintenance of a game
keeper to kill the vermin ami breed
introduced varieties of game birds
suited to the covers will give sport
to the members of a Club, who can
afford an annual outlay of from
$23.00 to $100.00 in such luxuries, and
will increase the amount of game in
adjoining covers which are open to
the publi -.
The posting of a cover against all
hunting without the employment of a
game keeper or guardian to. kill off
vermin is a detriment because it will
permit the increase of vermin by
which, i mean the animals which
prey on all small game In numbers
sulllcient to more than off set any in
crease in game. I would not have
you think that 1 favor anything which
will tend to diminish the public hunt
ing. Under the policy suggested the
hunting territory will he slightly
diminished but the amount of game
will be Increased.

CABINET MEMBERS RESIGN
Congress of Workmen Fails to En
dorse Compulsory Service far
Unmarried Men.
London, Jan. 7. By a majority of
20S, the British Parliament lias
passed the first reading of Premier
Asquith's conscription bill, under
which all single men of military age
or widowers without children depen
dents, may be drafted into the mili
tary service. Balloting showed 403
members for and 105 against the
measure. The vote was taken short
ly after 11 o'clock last night. The
minority was composed of national
ists, some lahorites and a few radi
cals. The vote, which seems to presage
the passage of the bill, came despite
the antagonism shown against it by
the labor congress in London yester
day, which by a large majority fa
vored the withdrawal of the meas
ure from Parliament.
The quitting of the cabinet or Ar
thus Henderson, the laborite presi
dent of the board of education, and
the withdrawal from the government
councils of two other laborites, Will
iam .Brace, the parliamentary under
secretary for home affairs, and
George 11. Roberts, the lord eommis
slonei of the treasury followed the
vote of the labor congress. The con
gress, representing the , organized
labor of Great Britain, decided
against, the government's compulsion
bill by the overwhelming majority of

the Stare's assets in fiah and game. I
regard the denizens of our waters as
the more valuable of these resources.
The investments in cummer, camps,
especially alone the shores p( Lake
Cliamplain and of our numerous in
land lakes, Is enormous and constant
ly increasing.
Iu this connection, I must sound a
word of warning at the tendency of
Individuals and power companies to
use' our natural lakes as reservoirs,
raising and holding the water above
normal high water level and, by ex
cavating at the outlets, drawing it at
their convenience to an abnormally
low water level! Thus the lakes are
shorn of their beauty in the summer
time, the campers are inconvenienced
in getting their boats in and out of
their ('hellers and, worst of all, the
si a wning beds are left high and dry
in some instances and when lhe
water is being drawn in the summer
time many young fish are carried opt
with the current.
The exploitation of the water pow
er resources of the State should be
encouraged, but there should be sorao
regulative control and supervision of
those who are misusing one of the
State's- moi't valuable asnets anuVthe
Individual owners of lake shore prop
erty should be properly protected.
The natural lakes and ponds of Ver
mont are the people's heritage wihch
should be kept Inviolate.
Artificial fish ponds are increasing
the value of real estatae, much of
which is otherwise unproductive, and
this is usually accomplished without
curtailing the public fishing. Let me
here suggest that every land owned
who has on his property a place
which can be converted into a fish
pond without the sacrifice of land
more valuable for other purposes, be
encouraged to do so. And I suggest
to all of you to be on the lookout for
impioduetive real estate on which a
pond can be economically constructed
and to which the necessary uniount
of water can be conducted. Such
property can thus be made of produc
tive value nnd the demand for private
fish preserves is constantly on the
increase.
Soiiio of you will now suggest that
this .means curtailment of public fish
ing, but such is not the cause. The
overflow from fish ponds almost in
variably results in improved fishing
in the waters below 1 hem and the
more fish we can produce in private
preserves the less will the fishes In
the public waters be drawn upon.
