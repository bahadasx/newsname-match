USELESS RISK IN

Intornatidulvjjjbrlsi
Scnato -Exports
nnd Neutrality I
Aro Aired in Debate.
Washington, Jan. 6. :
fUralnt ngalnst public discuss!
international relations of tho Unl
Slates Incident to tho European
were broken in tho Sonato yesterday
nnd for moro than an hour tho sos
Blon -was enllvoned by dobato over
tho neutrality policy of tho govern
ment exports of war munitions, and
travel by American citizens on ships
owned by tho bolllgeront nations.
Thero was no division of tho de
baters along party linos. Sonator
Jones, of Washington, donouncod as
"unpatriotic" American citizens' who
imperilled tho nation by taking pas
sago on belligerent 'vessels. Senator
Works, of California, Republican, as
serted that tho government of the
United States was "hypocrltncally"
olnmlng to bo neutral, whon It was In
fact participating in tho war
through tho salo of munitions.
Senator Lodge, ranking Republi
can member of the Foreiugn Rela
tions Committee, declared that to
place an embargo on arms now would
be worth moro to Germany than a
million men,, that It would bo a gross
ly "unneutral act," and would In fact
wake the United States tho ally of
Germany. Senators O'Gorman, of
Now York, and Hitchcock, of Nebras
ka, both Democrats, urged the ad
visability of an embargo on muni
tlons. Sonator O'Gorman also -'in
formed tho Senate that American
Consul R. N. McNcoly, who lost his
lire on tho Britlshlinor. Persia, had
disregarded the qgvlco of American
Consul General Skinner at London,
that ho make the )ournoy to Aden on
a Butch vessel.
Tho discussion was precipitated
whon Senator Jones read a newspa
per article, urging American citizens
'to keep off bolligercnt ships, and ad
vifijng the Prosidont to proceed slow
ly in tho present crisis heeding 'the
"Interest of 90,O0Oiu'0OpVpple, rath
er than that of a thousand reckless,,,
Inconsiderate and unpatriotic citi
zens who insist on traveling on bel
llgoront ships."-
Senator Nelson, of Minnesota, Re
publican', aroused Senator Q'Gprman
by asking whether Senator Jones re
garded Consul McNeoly unpatriotic
becauso he sailed for his post on the
Persia. Aftor the Now York sonator
had "explained that McNeely had de-
4 - soed Consul Gcnoral Skin
ner's aavico to sail on a uutcn snip,
Sonator Works blazod tho way to a
general debate op. ,tbopo3ltion of tho
"United States inttiehvor by declaring
that tho American 'government was
not neutral.
"It was not ncessary for him to
havo been sent on an American ship
to his post," Senator O'Gorman said.
"Thero was a neutral ship ready to
sail and ready to carry him to his
post at Aden. Ho was advised by
one of our consular representatives
long in the service, Mr. Skinner, who
accompanied him from Now York to
England, that ho had hotter continue
his Journey on a Dutch ship to Adon,
and this ship was ready to sail. For
some reason, apparently satisfactory
to himself, Consul McNelly disregard
ed that advice and sailed on tho bel
ligerent ship."
Mr. truorman's ueciaration was
in roply to a suggestion by Senator
Owen that American officials bo sent
to their posts abroad on American
Bblps.
Asserting at tho outset that the
government shared tho responsibili
ty for deaths of American citizens on
the Lusitanoa, tho California senator
Wiiiu;
"Tho government .knew that tho
Lusltania was loaded to tho guards
with ammunition and explosives. Tho
pnssongors were pormlttod, In spite
of this, to travel on tho vessel. Tho
government tsolf, in full knowledge
that tho vessel carrlod munitions of
war, is morally rosponsblo for the
doats of nur cltlzons."
Whon Senator Works declared tho
United States was actually partici
patihg in tho war by tho sale of mu
nitlons, Senator Rood, Democrat, in
terrupted" to aBk:
"Docb tho Sonator not know that
the first loan placed in tbis countrf
after tho war began was a loan of
$25,006,000 to Gormnny, and that
tho loan was niado without protest
from him or any other citizen. Does
tho Sonator not know that Germany
procured arms in this country as long
as it was possible for her to got them.
on this side?

1916 TAX ROLLS
ARE RALLED UP
Commissioners Besieged by tforamn
Alleging Wrong Assessment of
Their Property. Trcnsurcr of tho
Comity Also Catches It.
ho county commissioners woath
storm whon tho met In thoir
ar monthly session last week.
literally bessleged and swamp
ed by peoplo from all parts of the
county who wore literally "kicking
like bay steers" about tho assess
ment of their property for tho taxes
for tho current year. Prior to tho
meeting of tho commissioners, Coun
ty Trasuror Harrison caught tho
storm, peoplo doing their kicking to
him, and in a great enough numbor
to keop him nlmost continually ox
plaining that he as nothing to do with
tho tax rolis, navo the collection of
tho taxes as thoy aro assessed.
Tho law gives tho county commis
sioners power to correct erroneous
assessments. Tho county nttornoy
holds that. by erroneous assossmonts
tho law moans tho assessing of prop
erty that Is non-taxablo, and purely
clerical errors, sr.ch as an error In
addition. Consequently, if a man
comes in with a claim that he ren
dered his property at one price and It
shows a higher rate' on the tax roll,
ho has only one romedy. And in that
caso It would bo tho paying of his
taxes under protest, and bringing
suit in tho courts to recover tho ov
ercharge. Whon this Is done, tho
Treasurer must ondorso on tho tax
rpcelpt, "Paid under protest", and
must keep his copy of this receipt
and tho money so collected sop'arato
from other moneys, until the matter
is disposed of by tho courts.
Tho claims of incorrect assess
ments are many and vaird. One man,
so it is told, Bays ho rendered, Cash
$100; but tho tax rbllB show $1,000.
Others claim that their land was ren
dered at one price and that the-Board
Of Equalization passed it; but the
rollB show" higher prices. Still others
it is said, allege, proporty rendered
that thov did not no&soRa. . . '

and that is all there Is to it. There,

have ever occurred before." '
Under tho laV, tho county commis
sioners havo no power to correct any
assessment of proporty, either by re
duction of assessment or by refund
of money. At the time this was writ

Works replied, "but that does not
alter tho situation."
"If it be truo," continued Sonator
Reed, "that tho markets of this coun
try aro freo and open to Germany as
well as to the other countries, 'and
that this government does not dis
tinguish betweon any belligerent na
tions,, then how can tho Senator say
that this government has taken an
unneutral positon?"
"It is Impossible to get arms to
Grmany, and I Bay it is morally
wrong for this government to permit
shipment of arms to any of tho bellig
erents," Senator Works insisted. Ho
added that his principal objection
was based on tho conviction that tho
Unted States was aiding in prolong
ing the war and the killing of men,
and ho would not only put an ombar
go on munitions, but also on ship
ment of food and clothing to the ar
mies of Europe. Senator Lodgo, In
upholding tho position of tho United
States as to .the bhipment of muni
tions, engaged In a lengthy colloquy
with Senators O'Gorman, Hitchcock
and others.
Sonator Hitchcock asked Senator
Lodge whothor it was unneutral for
Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Hoi
land to place an embargo on tho ship
mqnt of munitions after the war be
gan. Placing of the embargo by tho
nations mentlonod, Senator Hitch
cock wont on to say, "doprlvod Ger

NEW ASSESSOR
LAW IN EFFECT
Assessor Goes to Each Voting Pre
cinct to Take Renditions. The
Taxpayers Aro Obllgod to Meet
Him There. Penalties.
Effective January first, tho now
county assessor's law becomes opera
tive, and Is so vastly different from
tho old law as to entirely chango tho
proceduro of assessing proporty for
taxation. Tho law is very plain and
easily understood, and reads as fol
lows: "Tho county assessor shall on tho
fifteenth day of January of each year
proceed to take a list of taxable prop
orty In tho county, nnd assess tho
value thereof as of January first, In
tho following mannor, to-wlt: By
posting notices in three or more con
spicuous places in each city or voting
proclnct at least ten days prior to tho
date tho assessor will meet tho tax
payers to list their proporty, and said
ri.'.'essor shall remain at each city or
voting precinct one, day for each six
tl voters, or major fraction thereof, in
said city or voting precinct. If any
taxpayor shall fall to mfiet tho as
sessor to list his poperty on tho date
advertised in his voting precinct, ho
may meet him in nothor township or
voting precinct and list same. If any
taxpayer by reason of slclcnes3 or any
other unavoidable circumstance, shall
not be able to meet the assessor on
tho dato advertised, -he may render a
written list of all his personal prop
erty, including a legal description of
his real estate. If any, and bhall sub
scribe and swear to tho oath requir
ed by each taxpayer as to its correct
ness. After hie county assessor shall
havo visited each city and voting
precinct in compliance with tho fore
going provision of this act, he shall
give notice by publication in some
newspaper of general circulation in
tho county, and if there Is no news
paper published in tho county, then
by posting notices in each voting pre
cinct! THAT PB WIIyL. BE IN HIS
OFFICE AT- THE county seat the
next twenty days for tho purpose of
uwHtisHiuK uiusu wuo .nave not assess
ed their property -for tho current
year. At. tho expiration of twenty
days those who have failed to assess
their property for the current year
shall bo declared delinpuent, nnd the
penalty of one dollar for such failure
shall bo added to their tax and enter
ed on tho tax books, and collected by
tho county treasurer, and when col
lected shall bo paid to the deputy as
sessor or his department, who assess
ed said delinquent property."
In addition to tho manner of as
sessing property, the assessor goes
on a straight salary basis Janutry
first, and his deputies aro also paid
salaries. Herejororo the compensa
tion of tho assessor was baaed on a
percentage of tho assessed valuations
and tho salares of his, deputies came
out of his own pocket. The salary of
tho assessor of Bryan county will
amount to about tho same as tho avr
erago salaries of othor county offi
cials. RESOURCES AND MEN
The wealth of a community is not
tho sum of Its natural resources, as
"natural resources" havo come to do
known, but of theso lus tho quality
or Its men. Strong men can make a
poor country rich, and weak men can
as surely make a rich country poor.
Enthusiasts, sometimes called by tho
appellation "cranl ci", are essential
to tho wolfaro of tho richest commun
ity. If Boll county is one of the very
prosperous counties in tho Stato It Is
duo primarily to tho richness of Its
natural opportunities. But also It
Is duo largely to tho energy of such
cranks as Colonel Downs,, Mr. Poo
nnd Mr. Jones. By looking close
enough ono will see that tho counties
in Texas that havo prospered most
notably aro the countios blessed with
ono or moro suchi onthuslasts. A
county without its cranks Is poor In
deed. Tho disparities aro not so much
in opportunities as In tho men who
havo fallon heir to tho Opportunities.
Tw,o or throo men qf courago and on-
torprlso can make tho county of
small. opportunities tho precedence" of
that of, largo ones. Dallas News.

was being wiped off tho map. No
damage was done In town, howover,
and tho only loss until this timo
known, is the loss or tho oil that es
caped from tho broken plpo, and the
damaged trees along tho branch,
where the fire hold sway.
Tho pipe line broko about noon at
a point east of tho creek on East Mala
street, out of tho city limits. Tho
break occurred right near tho creela
and tho prossuro from tho. pump sta-
tion forced tho oil through tho earth,
at tho brnkon point, and thenco It ran
Into tho creek, enough of tho oil es
caping to run dawn the creek fully a
half mile. , Someone, unknown to tho
Texas Company officials and employ
ees, sot the oil aflro at several points,
and from this tho flro spread, until
tho entiro creek for halt a rollo or
moro was a seething furnace, taking
all boforo It, and giving off groat
clouds of black smoke that went up
straight Into tho air for several hun

to tho northward llko an immonso

another flro scend was given the city.
This time tho wind was from tho

straight across the city- from tho
northeast to the southwest, clouding
things up very much ' ,
