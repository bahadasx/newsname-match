"Should Old Acquaintance
Be Forgot?"
FAREWELL SMOKER GIVEN
BY BREWERY WORKERS
AND BARTENDERS
Everett Local No. 254, Bartenders,
and Local 142, Brewery Workers, held
a joint meeting in the Labor Temple
winding up their affairs and prepar
ing to start in some new line of work.
Everyone who was there to enjoy the
smoker, assisted by the mulligan
band, was royally entertained. All
were sorry when the band started to
play "Should Old Acquaintance be
Forgot," for it meant the passing of
two locals from our midst; of faith
ful brothers who were always willing
to help in any cause. We are sure
every one will always remember the
smoker and cherish a warm spot for
the boys of Local 254 and Local 142.
FOOD EXPORTS DOUBLED
WASHINGTON. —The quantity of
foodstuffs sent by the, United States
to feed the rest of the world during
the first 10 months of this year was
more than double that in the same
period of 1914. Statistics of the de
partment of commerce show the value
of foodstuffs exported during the 10
months was almost $679,000,000, com
pared with $.118,000,000 last. year. The
total of wheat, corn and oats was
310,000,000 bushels; 12,448,000 barrels
of flour, and 420,000 pounds of bacon.
44-HOUR WEEK FOR WIRE
MEN
BOSTON. —The 44-hour week and
new wage scales for employees of
the New England rTelephone Com
pany were considered at the annual
conference of the New England dis
trict council of the brotherhood of
electrical workers. Delegates report
ed that trade union sentiment was
stronger than ever among workers in
this calling.
TIMBER PROSPECTS BRIGHT
SEATTLE.—Sec.-Treas. Reid of the
International Union of Timber Work
ers in urging these workers to greater
organizing activity, has this to say
in the monthly bulletin of that or
ganization :
"The reports which have been is
sued by the Pacific coast lumber and
shingle interests within the past ten
days are the most optimistic that
have been sent out during the last
several years. A canvass of the large
concerns brings forth their unani
mous opinion that the timber indus
try is on the eve of a boom unparal
leled in its history. Lumber prices
have advanced $1.00 to $3.00 within
the past 60 days, while another in
crease in the prices of red cedar
shingles was noted last week. The
manufacturers claim to now have
complete control of the markets,
which heretofore have been dominat
ed by the brokers and retailers. Mills
that, have been idle for one or more
years are resuming operations; oth
ers are beginning to operate two
shifts. There is no surplus stock at
the mills and very little in transit.
I>ast month heavy shipments of red
cedar shingles were made to Austra
lia and the Hawaiian Islands. The
log supply is light; in fact, a short
age is threatened.
"Lumber prices In the southeastern
states also have advanced."
TO ENLARGE NAVY YARDS
WASHINGTON.—Secretary of the
Navy Daniels has recommended to
congress that five United States navy
yards he equipped to build battle
ships of the largest type. These are
the Norfolk, Pugot Sound, Mare Is
land, Philadelphia and New York
yards.
This would double the battleship
producing capacity of the country, as
there are now only five private yards
which can handle such an order.
OREGON COMPENSATION
LAW UPHELD BY COURT
SALEM. —Pronouncing the work
men's compensation act constitution

cuit court in the case of Geo. Evan
hoff vs. the state Industrial accident
commission. The action was express
ly brought to test the validity of the
law.
WILL CONGRESS PRINT
WALSH PROBE REPORT?
WASHINGTON. —The report of the
commission on industrial relations has
been referred to the committee on
printing by the house of representa
tives.
When Speaker Clark announced the
report was before tbe house, Con
gressman Lewis, chairman of the
committee on labor, moved that 200,
--000 copies of the final report and 10,
--000 copies of all testimony taken be
printed. In the final report is the
summing up of the various groups of
the commission.
Following a debate on parliament
ary procedure, the speaker ruled that
according to the rules and practices
of the house the resolution was not
privileged. No opposition to printing
the report developed at this time, al
though Congressman Davis of Texas
took occasion to say:
"While I am not familiar with your
rules and regulations and the ruts in
which you have run before, I under
stand this to be a very inopportune
time for any man to become parsimon
ious or picayunish over the printing of
a matter that the whole country and
the whole civilized world has got its
eyes on. There are more than 40,
--000 farmers in my state who are in
terested in the development made in
that investigation as to the land mo
nopolies of Texas, and they are anx
ious and heart-throbbing about it, and
the Federation of Labor and the
bankers and business men all through
the state have insisted that this re
port and these proceedings of this
commission must be put in such tan
gible shape that they can get the
facts and that the whole matter must
be put before them.
"The press paraded the fact that
there were two carloads of it, and
that it ought to be sent to the junk
pile. 1 want to notify you right now
that if there is a man from Texas
who votes to have it go to the junk
pile, he will meet me on the stump
when he gets back to Texas in the
next campaign."
The committee on printing, which
will make recommendations on the
number of copies to be printed, con-'
sists of Congressmen Barnhart, In
diana, chairman; Tavenner, Illinois,'
and Kiess, of Pennsylvania.
DOES UNIONISM PAY?
CHICAGO.—Truck Drivers' Union
No. 705, the largest single local af
filiated to the Brotherhood of Team
sters, has raised wages $1.50 a week
for every man driving a team or au
tomobile. Employers first offered a
50-cent increase and then 75 cents,
but the 1,500 truckers stuck by their
original demand, which was finally
agreed to, and a contract signed.
General President Tobin of the
brotherhood cites the history of this
local, formed in 1902, to show the
value of unionism. He shows that
since that time single drivers have
received $1,924 and double drivers
$2,782 over the rates they received
when the union was organized. Dur
ing this time these workers have paid
on an average of 60 cents a month
into the local union.
The gains may also answer the
question. "Why do some employers
oppose the trade union movement?"
MINIMUM WAKE FOR GIRLS
BOSTON. —The. minimum wage
commission issued a decree estab
lishing a minimum wage of $8.50
weekly for 10,000 women employed
in the department stores in Massa
chusetts.
STRIKE INCREASES WAGES
DETROIT. —After a seven weeks'
strike machinists employed by the
American Car & Foundry Company
have won their demand for higher
rates. Former wages averaged about
37% cents an hour. The new mini
mum Is 45 cents, and in some cases
55 cents.
Five minutes a day used in boost
ing your local union will show re
markable results. Surely you can
spare that much time.

THE AUTHOR
(The author of this bulletin hap
pens to be an official of an interna
tional labor union. But he could
write with as much conviction if he
were merely a public-spirited citizen.
If he is better qualified than some
others to draw an indictment against
the. professional strike-breaker, it is
merely because his experience has
given him first- hand knowledge of
facts which can be confirmed by any
newspaper reader, as they will be
confirmed by many governors, may
ors, chiefs of police and other execu

lem at first hand.)
By John P. White
President United Mine Workers and
Member Permanent Committee In
dustrial Relations.
Indianapolis, Ind., Jan. 8, 1916.
In asking congress to prohibit tho
interstate shipment of strike break
ers, armed guards and machine guns,
the committee on industrial relations
is striking at the direct and imme
diate cause of nine-tenths of the vio
lence that has accompanied industrial
strife in this country and that at
times has threatened disastrous inter
nal disorders.
National preparedness demands
such action. President Wilson spoke
for all thinking men when he pro
claimed the necessity of removing
"every untoward circumstance in
these times of international turmoil."
Fresh in every mind are the horrors
of the massacre at Ludlow in Colora
do; the killing and maiming of inno
cent workmen at Roosevelt, N. J.; the
shooting down of other workmen at
Bayonne. These are only the more
recent and conspicuous instances. It
is a record for peace times at home
that weakens the nation's voice when
lit speaks for order and humanity
abroad. It weakens not only the
voice but the heart. For how can a
; government win the respect and
whole-hearted loyalty of its workmen
[ when those workmen have seen their
brothers shot, beaten and driven from
the community without interference
by the authorities, and often, as in
i Colorado, with their malignant co
operation?
Greatest Step Forward
The elimination of the professional
imported strike breaker will not solve
the problem of industry. It will not
remove all discord in the industrial
field. That discord cannot be removed
until fundamental changes have been
wrought in the relations between the
employing corporations and the work
men who man their shops. But it will
go farther toward removing the dan
ger than any other measure which
this congress could take. It can be
claimed in all reasonableness that an
act accomplishing this elimination
would deserve to rank first in any
legislative program for preparedness.
Not only would the practical opera
tion of the act prevent a recurrence
of Ludlow and Roosevelt, but its
mere passage would be a sign to the
workers that their government stood
with them against exploitation, per
' sedition and injustice. It is a sign
that the workers wait for and de
mand.
Congress would be merely sanction
ing and decreeing in statute form
AN ANTI-UNION GEM
TACOMA. —In an address to the
Employers' Association of this city,
Earl G. Constantlne pictured the beau
ties of the non-union shop and the
evils of the union shop, which he in
sisted on terming "closed shop."
During one of his oratorical flights
he unburdened himself thusly:
"The closed shop is opposed to ex
tra pay for the more efficient work
er."

what has already become the enlight
ened practice of the executive arm.
Pernicious and Dangerous
Progressive and successful execu
tive officials in city, stale and nation
have recognized the Imported strike
breaker as a pernicious and danger
ous institution. These executives,
finding themselves responsible for tbe
maintenance of order in the face of
disturbances that destroyed or threat
ened to destroy the peace of tbe com
munity, have acted first and consult
ed legal precedents later. In every
case they have found themselves jus
tified in fact and it is time that their
Wisdom should be justified in law as
i well.
i For otherwise the peace 0 f the com
munity during industrial disputes will
continue to depend on officials whose
training has seldom given them the
knowledge and understanding of in
dustrial problems that would dictate
the course which congress is asked
to make obligatory. The choice of
governors and mayors is made on is
sues other than those arising during
times of industrial distress, and today -
it is a happy accident when the of
ficial who, suddenly called upon to
handle a strike situation, has the wis
dom and courage to keep out strike
breakers.
Within the past two years the wis
dom of the course urged upon con-;
gress has been strikingly demon
strated.
Colorado's Shame
During the strike of coal miners
in Colorado in 1913-1914, the governor
of Colorado succeeded in preventing
violence and keeping order just so
long as he continued his original pol
icy of refusing the use of troops to
escort strike breakers who had been
shipped into Colorado from other
states. Former United States Sena
tor Patterson, whose long and rich ex
perience in public affairs had taught
him the danger of permitting the im
portation of strike breakers, was the
governor's advisor in formulating the
policy, and he has eloquently testified
to the chaos and violence that result
ed when the coal operators coerced
the governor into abandoning it.
Beginning immediately after the
state gave its sanction and assistance
to the importation of strike breakers,
the discord increased in violence un
til the occurrence at Ludlow, five
months later, in which thirteen wom
en and children and six men living
in the strikers' colony were killed by I
militia and mine guards.
President Wilson sent the federal
troops to Colorado one week after the
Ludlow massacre. In his first or
ders to the commanding officer, Sec
retary of War Garrison directed the
troops to prohibit the importation of j
strike breakers. '.esorder at once
ceased, and during the six months
the federal troops remained in the
field under these orders peace was
maintained without difficulty.
Chicago an Example
In the summer of 1915 the city of
Chicago witnessed a strike that com
pletely tied up the surface and ele
vated street car transportation for
three days. The companies tele- |
graphed to New York for strike
breakers, and these were dispatched
by the train-load. En route to Chi
cago, one consignment of these roy- ,
ing desperadoes broke from their
METAL POLISHERS'
WEARY WAIT
MELBOURNE, Victoria, Aus. -Pres.
Parsons of the Motor and Cycle
Trades' Union, which includes grind
ers and metal polishers, is protesting
at the inaction of the wages board
that sets wages in this industry. The
unionist declares that the board has
been sitting for two years, but has not
yet made an award As it is illegal to
strike, the union has called a meeting
to discuss the question.

guards at a station in Pennsylvania
and raided depot lunch-rooms, seizing
all the food and drink in sight and
defying the authorities. Desperate
men accustomed to the quick use of
fire arms swarmed into Chicago from
every direction. Tho city looked for
ward with dread to a bitter strike.
Then the city council passed an ordi
nance introduced by Alderman John
C. Kennedy, which in intention and
effect prohibited importation of strike
breakers by requiring that no man
should be employed on the transpor
tation lines who had not had six
months' experience. The companies'
uncompromising attitude Immediately
collapsed. They announced that they
Would accept arbitration as proposed
by the mayor. Within twelve hours
traffic was resumed on all lines. Not
a man had been injured, not a dollar's
worth of property destroyed, or an ar
rest made. The city was saved weeks
and months of intense discomfort, vio
lence, bloodshed, and property loss
running into the millions.
Look at Wilkes-Barre
Contrast Chicago's experience with
that of Wilkes-Barre, where for many
weeks during the fall of 1915 street
car service was paralyzed, and the
city passed through a reign of terror
that was made worse instead of bet
ter by the presence of the state con
stabulary. In Wilkes-Barre the re
sponsible executive permitted the Im
portation of strike-breakers. Public
opinion condemned this policy. The
people themselves struck in an or
ganized refusal to patronize the cars.
Crowds containing more citizens not
personally involved than strikers
blocked the progress of the cars, at
tacked strike breakers, and showed
their hostility to a course which had
replaced home-making, peace-loving
citizen workmen with professional
thugs from the slums of New York.
After weeks of turmoil and disorder
the strike is still in progress at the
time of writing.
The Wilkes-Barre case is particu
larly illuminating, because it proved
that adequate and efficient policing is
no solution to the problem of strike
violence. The Pennsylvania state po
lice are recognized as the most effi-1
cient body of the sort in existence.
Vet the importation of professional
trouble-makers and the intense public
reseutment against their presence
created a situation which the state
police were unable to handle.
A Governor on the Job
I Quite as recently, Governor Hunt
of Arizona averted a conflict between
mine operators and miners that prom
ised to be as disastrous as that in
i Colorado by insisting that the com
panies not import strike breakers.
"We are to have no repetition of
Colorado here," said Governor Hunt.
And by placing his finger on the di
rect and immediate cause of strike
violence he saved Arizona from dis
aster.
, What are the facts regarding the
practice which congress is asked to
stop? They are startling, and known
only to a few.
Strike breaking has been organized
as a profitable industry. It is in the
hands of men who are experts in or
ganizing brutality and terrorizatton.
The manager of a single strike
breaking agency has boasted that

UNORGANIZED S FEARFUL
PRICE
INDIANAPOLIS.—The unorganized
West Virginia miners are paying a
fearful price for their refusal to unite,
says J. W. Brown, writing in the
United Mine Workers' Journal. This
unionists presents the following fig
ures to prove the connection between
nonunionism and fatalities:
"The records of the public service
commission for the year ending June
.10, 1914, show 544 miner* who have
been killed outright, 21 so crippled
that they can never work in the
mines. 66 who are otherwise crippled
for life, and 10.787 minor accidents
which were serious enough to come
under the observation of the public !
service commission. This is about
one man killed for every 100,000 tons <
of coal dug. to say nothing of the
10,787 accidents, and is just 25 men I
killed every year for every 3,000 men j
working in the mines, which is about
four times as many as are killed in
the mines of Pennsylvania, Illinois
or Ohio.
"There is a direct connection be
tween this wanton sacrifice of human
life and the unorganized conditions
of the miners themselves. All things
in life have their price, and for un
bridled competition the miners pay
the dearest.
"Men driven to toil as these miners
are will shirk every responsibility no
matter how much danger they incur,
hence the explosions."

The national child labor committee
