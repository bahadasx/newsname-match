the British operatibns at Suvla
Bay. He was relieved of com
mand of his division and returned
to London.
ROOT OF FAILURE.
The division genorals were Informed
Hint In vleW of the Inadequate artil
lery support; General Stopford did not
wish them to make frontal attacks on
intrenched positions." said General
Hamilton In one section of his report.

thousand Bulgarian, Austrian, and
German troops are now massed along

ing up positions behind tho Bulgarian
center, French airmen report today.
They assert that at least seven Bul
garian divisions are now within a few
hours' march of the Greek border

The Anglo-French forces near the
Greek border are expected- to fall
back to this line If attacked by su

Board of Directors of the Two
Companies Identical With

By S. M. REYNOLDS.
It has been statrd In the preceding
article that the elertrlc Hsht and power
patrons of the Potomac Electric Power
Company, excluding, of course, the
Washington Railway and Electric Com
pany, which gets more than half the
output of the power plant at lc4a than
cost, are not only paving fat dividends
on the outstanding stock of the Po
tomac Klecttlr Power Company, tut
very respectable dividends on the stock
of tlio rallua company.
It Is tli a purpose of this article to show
tho manner In which this is done. It
will be shown tl-nt the Washington
Railway and Electtlc Company, al
though appearing In the sworn annual
report of the power company as own

And. furt hcrmnre. while the railway

showed n duilclt. nevertheless, the lp
come which the railway company sot
from Its stock In the Potomac Electric
Power Company, plus Its income from
stock In subsidiary companies and Its
sale of part of the -jlectrlc power obtained-
f rom the Potomac Electric Power
Company, produced enough to enable
the Washington Hallway and Electric
Company to pay 7 P-r cnt dividends
on Its common stock an' 5 per cent on
its prufeircd atr.ck. And finally it will
be shown that the railway company's
Income from Its .stock Iti the power com.

Acquired Capital Stock.
The Washington Railway and Electric
Company acquired the capita stock of
the Potomac Electric Power Company
by virtue of the act of Congress ot
June 15, 1900. under which a number of
small street railway companies were

"Ought to Be Cqmmenced at

Says Committee.
Work of developing the water power of
the. falls df the Potomac river should
begin at once, In tne opinion of the sub
committee of the Chamber of Commerce
which investigated the project, and re
ported today.
The subcommittee Is so stronrly In
favor of the water power project that
it recommends a District bond Issue. It

The reoort savs electric rates here are
Jilshep- than the average In twenty-six
other cities, some lamer and some
smaller than Washington. and contains
this statement: "The development of
the power of the falls of the Potomac
river Is the most' desirable means of
supplying current to the city of Wash

which Roy C. Claflin Is chairman' fol
low:
"Your subcommittee has the honor to
report after investigation and study,
that It Is our Judgment that the project

falls of the Potomac river, ought to be
commenced at tbe earliest nosslble time,
"In a nreDared chart, the Information
for which was compiled by J. Q. Will
iams, the chief statistician of the Public
I Ulitles Commission, statistics are set
forth concerning electric current and
rates for twenty-six representative
American cities. Including Washington.
A study of this chart discloses the fact
that In the District of Columbia tbe
rates for current are hirher than the
average. Matty smaller and ' many
larger cities 'have a much lower rate
than the city of Washington.
What Cleveland Did.
"However, It is not alone the fact
that Washington pays,& higher rate for
electricity than tho average city' on
which we base our conviction that the
water power ot tne roinnvac snouid bq
developed. If this were the case we
could merely offer aa a remedy & mu

engineers. Colonel Langfltt, whose

that the FederalGovernment does not
desire to assume the thsk at this

to authorise the District of Columbia
take up the work on its own be

"It is believed that the Great Falls
project la so entirelv worthy and nnc

proposition In every way, that the
District of Columbia would do well
to take up the work on Its own

showing that neither the Vienna
foreign office, nor United States
consular representatives bad ob
tained one legal fact determining
how the British steamer Persia
was sunk. .
The-sinking of this steamer, with
the probable death of two Ameri
can citizens, precipitated this new
submarine crisis.
PLEDGED TO SECRECY.
Members of the Cabinet were silent
after the meeting. They had been
pledged to secrecy regarding the Gov
ernment's policy until the President
and Secretary of State Lanslnr are
ready to put this policy In effect.
From authorltatve sources ta is learned
that the United States is through deal
ing with Individual nations and specific
instances of submarine attack. The new
policy Is one that will be directed to all
nations, and will present all belligerents
the demand that the laws of nations
and of humanity must be recognized in
submarine Warfare, or tbe United
States will break off relations with of
fending belligerents and their allies.
Secretary of State Lansing, before
colnp to the Cabinet meeting', re
ceived a cablegram from Ambassador
Penfleld, at Vienna, to the effect that
on Tuesday he had been advisfcd that
I he Austrian fort-lgn uffice and the
Austrian admiralty "had leceived no
infoi motion whatever" regarding the
sinking of the Persia, and asltlntf
what information the tJovernment ut
the United States might have regard
ing' this attack. The foreign offlc
cssured him, Penfleld said, that it
would give the United States all the
Information it could obtain.
Cable From Garrels.
Another cablegram from American
Consul Garrels, at Alexandria, said,
that affidavits of the American,
Grant, and twenty other survivors of
the Persia 'disaster were being for
warded to Washington. All confirm
ed the fact that no Warning' wm Klvtp
and no vessel was aen. He had not
been able to tbtaln affidavits of the
British officers and crew of the Per
sia, because they had sailed for En it
land before he could get them.
Instructions will be given the Ameri
can consuls at the first port the British
officers and crew if the Persia reach to
obtain their uffldavlts. The second of
ficer of the Persia is the only one who
has testified to having seen evidence qC
a submarine.
The jn'y significant fact announced
afle rthe Cabinet meeting was slat
inmt bv Secretary Lenslnir thnt he ex
petted to ronfer thli afternoon with
Count von Bernstorff. tho airman am
bassador. Secretary Landing and the
Jerman ambassador have been In con
fidence lately, attempting to reach a
settlem-nt of the LusltanK case. It Is
considered certain that Secretary Lan
sltiK will enter Into dUeusxon of the
jtitre submarine Controversy with Count
von Bctnstorff.
Guns On Steamer.
The arrival of the Italian steamer
Gulseppe Verdi at New York with two
3-Inch guns mourned, a report of which
reached Washington today, brings the
gun question to the front, and may force
the United States to take a new stand
on the question ot what armament may
be carried by merchant ships.
The charge that the Verdi had naval
gunners manning the guns all the way
through the Mediterranean submarine
cone for defensive purposes is pointed
to by Austrian diplomats in Justifica
tion of their government's position that
the presence of a sun on board a mer
chantman removes that vessel's im
munity from attack.
It has been made plain that this will
be Austria's defense Isv the Perslav at
tack. If charged with responsibility by.
the United States, for thj Persia was
armed.
Whether the United States will amend
Its regulations Issued in 1901 when It
was decided a 6-Inch gun should be per
mitted on merchantmen for defensive
purposes, or whether the United States
In Its new submarine pol'y should
point out to the entente allied the dan
ger the ncsume from submarine at
lark Is one of the questions brought
before the Cabinet today. ,
