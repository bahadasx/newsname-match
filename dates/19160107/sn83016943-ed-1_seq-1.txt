Retrospect of the World War.
(From Scientific American.)
A cursory view of the military
situation in Europe,' as seen from
the outside of the so-called "irou
ring" which the Allies have at
tempted to maintain around the
Central Powers would seem to jus
tify the assertion of the Imperial
Chancellor, von Ilollweg, that
Germany is everywhere victorious.
She holds Belgium and one of the
richest sections of France in the
West; Poland is hers; and, recent
ly, with the aid of Bulgaria, she
has overrun Serbia and opened up
rail connection with Constantino
ple. The question of German success,
however, is indissoluhly bound up
with the question of German aims,
and, thanks to the explicit teach
ings of her military writers, we
know exactly what the military
aims of Germany were, when the
Kaiser let loose the dogs of war in
the summer of 1914. A swift
drive in overwhelming fore upon
Paris; the occupation of the French
capital; an army of occupation in
France; a rapid transfer of the
flower of the army to the Eastern
frontier, and a furious campaign
by overwhelming forces against;
liussia, for the purpose of breaking
up, capturing and dispersing the
Russian hosts, preparatory to the
03cupation of Warsaw and Petro
grad. The German plan, magnificent
in occupation, failed utterly when
the allied forces under General
Joure turned furiously upon the
invaders and threw them back at
the battle of the Marne. In the
East the Austrian armies were
overwhelmed by the Russian hosts.
The close of 1914 found the Ger
man army hold fast in France, and
the victorious Russians in posses,
sion of Galicia, and making ready
to pour down through the Carpa
thian passes into the plains of
Hungary.
In the early spring of 1915, Ger.
many, 'taking over the supreme
control of the Austrian troops,
biokcMirough tbo Russian linA
on the Donajec, and commenced
that great drive, which must go
down into history as one of the
most stupendous military exploits
of all time. Brilliant as these
operatiops have been, there is a
consensus of military opinion that
they' have been inconclusive. The
Russian army is today despite its
reverses unoroken; its losses have
been enormous, but although it
has bent it has never been broken.
The Central Powers have failed to
disperse and disarm the armies of
the Czar, which under the spell of
rest atloided by the rigor of the
Russian winter, are being re-enforced
and muntionefcl lor the
spring campaign.
Judged, therefore, solely by the
test of what Germany set out to
do, it must be confessed that she
has failed. The German lines in
France are holdiug. It is true;
but the Anglo-French drive in
September gave every reason to
believe that when another milliou
of the British troops has been
thrown into France and the re
quisite supplies of ammunition
have been stored back of the al
lied position, it will be found pos
sible to break through the German
line on a front wide enough to
cause a retirement of the whole
front to new positions. Failiug
that, the war on the Western front
must settle down to one of attri
tion, and judging by the acknowl
edged Prussian losses to date of
2,250,000 men, and the monthly
losses on all fronts estimated by'
the best military authorities at
300,000, the decisive issue must
surely come before the close of
1917.
The outstanding fact of the nav
al operations has been the remark
able success of the British defeu
sive1 against the German subma
rine raid on merchant shipping.
The means adopted have been
many and all appear to have been
more or less successful. The nar
row channels have been netted,
and great success has attended the
towiug of large nets between pairs
of destroyers and trawlers. The
swift destroyers have accounted
for many, and a vast fleet of fast
motor boats, some of them private
craft and others built specialty lor
submarine chasing, acting in con
cert with the aeroplanes, has prov
ed a veritable terror to the under
sea craft.
Since their disastrous running
fight with the British battle ciuis-
n port, so far as the North Sea
is concerned. The British battle
ihip fleet at its station in the
Forth of Firth, awaits the long
deferred coming out of the Ger
man licet, while its scouts, de
stroyers aud submarines scour the
Aorth Sea to give earlv tidings of
the challenge, should it ever come,
The various naval engagements
have emphasized the supreme value
of speed. Great Britain has com
pleted the live 25 knot battleships
of the Qucon Elizabeth class.
Since the war opened, by the way,
she has added twelve dreadnoughts
to her active licet. Also, she has
just about completed five new battle-cruisers
of the largest size aud
the unprecedented speed of 32
knot". Her destroyer fleet, more
over, has been increased by the
addition of over 70 destroyers of
35 to 37 knots' speed. It begins
to look as though nothing short of
a miracle could break the strangle
hold of the fleet upon the naval
situation; and in the opinion of
the naval and military critics it is
believed that this may prove to be
the decisive factor in a war which
seems destined to settle down into
one of naval, military and econo
mic endurance.
A Good Selection.
It is probable that W. W. Ven
able of Meridian, Miss., will be
the new member of Congiess
from that district. Mr. Venable
made his race as a supporter of
administration policies; that
means the support of Mr. Wil
son's shipping bill.
The shipping bill is the most
important measure before the
present session of Congress. It
is of vast importance to the
Southern people. The cotton of
the South is now clogging the
seaports, and there are now no
ships to take it to the Liverpool
market. Since the outbreak of
the war there has been little free
shipping room for American pro
ducts. In the very nature of
thing v ship roon wa first utiliz
ed foramrnunitionand provisions
for the European armies, Am
munition and -provisions will get
the right of way until the end
comes, ihe soldiers cannot eat
either lumber or cotton, there
fore lumber and cotton must
wait.
The cotton crop of the South in
1914 would have fetched many
millions more if Americajhad had
ships. The same is true of the
cotton crop this year. The Un
ited States must be in a position
to have the cargoes of its citizens
hauled to any part of the world.
The necessity for supporting the
Wilson bill is so apparent that we
deem it useless to discuss its mer
its further Commercial-Appeal.
A Time for Prayer.
Rev. H. M. King, pastor of the
Second Baptist church, delivered
a prayer of unusual earnestness
and fervor at the convening of the
State Senate on. Tuesday.
Jlr.' King meant it, of course.
He was thoroughly sincere in ask
ing for "a peculiar wisdom" to
guide the body in all of its delib
erations, and in the consideration
of each aud every measure pre
sented for debate.
The incident, however, forcibly
brought to mind the prayer de
livered by Petroleum V. Xasby at
the opening of a Republican 'Na
tional Convention in Cleveland
many years ago. Henry Ward
Beecher was on the program for
the opening prayer, but at the
last moment the noted humorist
was substituted. Just before the
temporary chairman rapped for
order a delegate named Sew ard ap
proached Xasby and said:
"Parson, if you have any ago-'
uiziug petitious, any prayers of
extra fervency, offer them up for
these degelates. If there is any
eilicacy in prayer, it is my honest,
unbiased opinion that there never
was, in all the history of the world
nor never will be again, such a
magnificent change to make it
manifest. This is the time to try
yourself particularly."
However, we are reluctant to
believe that Mr. King was inspir
ed by any such idea, in the deliv
ery of his truly magnificent pray
er before the Senate yesterday.

W. H. Joyner, private secretary for
and candidate to succeed the late Rep
resentative Witherspoon is squarely
against any increase in the army or
navy, and in sympathy with the views
of Senator Vardaman. Also like Var
daman, he believes Wilson will oe re
nominated and that he is the only Dem
ocrat who can be elected. Llarion
Ledger. "Believing Wilson will be re
nominated, etc.," while busily
extending aid and comfort to tha
Hearsts, Roosevelts and other
patriots who are laying awake of
nights conspiring for Wilson's
defeat, is very "like Vardaman."
The "White Chief's" talent for
such "facing both ways" is well
illustrated in the following from
the West Point Times-Herald:
"One of our older inhabitants of
West Point met another old man
in front of the Elite theatre and
said ruminatingly: "Old man
Jim K. Vardaman aint what he
use to be. ' ' The other man chew
ed reflectively on for a few min
utes and then came back with:
"No; and never

Advice for the Legislature.
What the State needs more
than new laws is the correcting,
amending and strengthening of
those already on the statute books
and the repealing of those that
are answering no useful purpose.
Mississippi has more Iaw3 now
than her best lawyers can keep
track of, much less the ordinary
layman. Ignorance of the law is
no excuse for its violation, yet
there are many laws now in ex
istence unknown to nine men out
of every ten in the State. Kill
some of these, Kid the State gf
its useless appendages, and then
if a few practical, common-sense,
business laws are needed, enact
them. It is dangerous to begin
fooling with newfangled ideas.
It is easy enough to "start some
thing," but after started no man
can tell where it will end. It has
been the experience of former
legislators, that bills introduced
by them for 3 certain purpose
have been so amended as to leave
them unrecognizable by their
. 1 1 i ! A .
autnors ana tail 01 tne purpose
lor which they were intended.
Manv a legislator, after he has
seen the law accredited to him,
has been ashamed to own it, and
thoroughly repentant that he
ever fathered it. The Clarion
Ledger hopes this may not be
the experience of any of the mem
bers of the body which is soon to
assemble, but to guard as against
accidents, it is best to fully in
vestigate the subject before
hand, find out whether the law
is really needed, and then after
having thoroughly satisfied your
self, get the opinion of fellow
members, before starting your
canoe down a stream whose cur
rent you are unfamiliar with. In
other words, if you are not sure
of your ground, "let George do
it. ' 'Clarion-Ledger.
The thing for Republicans to
do is burv, instead of re-emphasizing,
the old troubles. In fling
ing down a challenge to the Re
publicans, having its animus in
the 1912 broil. Colonel Roosevelt
invites and will receive, but one
answer from the loval party
members. The party will not
have its candidates and policies
determined by a dictator. Hav
ing made it his main object to
defeat its candidate in 1312, the
Colonel will not be accorded the
privilege of ordering the party's
course in 1916, Springfield Un
ion. Since during the last few
months this country has been los
ing population to Europe instead
of gaining it, there is little likeli
hood that the problem of the un
employed will be so pressing this
winter as it wa3 a year ago and
two years ago. In fact, many
parts of the country now report
a shortage of unskilled labor a
very unusual condition at this
time of year.
