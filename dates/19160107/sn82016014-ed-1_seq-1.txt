Holland was officially announced to
day. The entire crow, number ins 33, was
rescued by the IuUh cruiser, Noord

jKU't of Holder.
Paris, Jan. 7. Fighting on the- Rus
Flnn frontier is fast growing in inten- ,
sity and assuming great ferocity, says
the Petrograd correspondent of the
Havas agency in a dispatch filed
Wednesday. Dispatches from Kieve
declare the noise of cannon can be
heard aloriK a distance of thirty-six
miles and that windows in all the vil
lages in this region have been broken
ly the concussions.
The battle is raging with particular
fury on the Tarnopol-Trcmbowla front
where more than 300,000 men with
3,500 cannon are engaged. Long
Austro-German Ked Crosn trains are
leaving this front daily for more re
mote and thinly populated towns,
where hospitals have been organized.
Wounded Russian officers report that
consequences of this battle already are
being shown in certain sectors hy the
blowing of first line German tranches,
and the slow but irresistible progress
of Russian forces. The same officers
tell of enormous difficulties the Rus
sians had to surmount on this frnnt,
whore entanglement? of barbed v. ire
aro often laid twenty-four deep and
charged with powerful eleetric cur-,
rents supplied from stations especially
erected.
An immediate approach to these en
tanglements is impossible. The Rus
elan soldiers have invented the fol
lowing method of surmounting the
difficulty. Good marksmen fling
ropes with hooks at the ends over the
barbed wire, then pull until they have
broken one of the lines of wire and
continue the method until the whole
entanglement is removed.
M iule Peace Overt u res.
London, . Jan. 7. Count Oku ma,
Japanese premier, told interviewers
today that Germany has made over

Fails as Poet

Pan Francisco. Jan. 7. Poet,

burglar by night that's how
Frederick Glanz describes himself.
I'pon a lot of hard-hearted editors
he blames the combination. He
didn't have the nerve to face the
blue pencil, after several rejec

turn burglar.
"1 dreamed of romance. he said
"but none came my way. 1 found
my manuscripts' turned down.

a Frankenstein monster had over
powered me. I had been hotel

WAS BUYING GAS FOR 8 CENTS
Under a Special Contract Made
Several Years Ago.
Xoiv It 3Iust Pay 28 Cents Just j
Like Common Citizens.
Orders of the $50,000 a year Bristow
utilities commission will probably
cause the state to pay $3,700 a month
extra for gas at the Parsons and Win-
field state hospitals. That is the esti-
mate today of members of the state ,
board of control, base a on notices irom
the gas companies. These notices are
based on the order of the Bristow
commission Increasing gas rates to 28
cents a thousand feet and canceling
all franchises and contracts for gas at j
lower rates.
Before the state commission "re-
formed" the gas situation in Kansas,
the state bought its gas for the Par
sons and Winfield state hospitals un- ;
der an eight cent contract. The con
tract was made years ago when Henry :
J. Allen was a member of the old state
board of charities, in the contract it
was provided that the state might re
ceive gas far general use- - at - eight
cents a thousand feet. .Now the con
tract is held by the ga.s company to
be null and void under the Bristow
order and the state must pay for some
of its own reform.
Based on a five months season for
the heavy use of gas, the new rate
means an increase of $17,500 a year
for the two institutions. It is hardly

HE WASNOT TOLD
Attorney for Gas Company Suf
fered in "News Iloldup."
Rumored That State Utility
"Organ" Had To Be Tuned.
Not until he visited the clerk's of
fice in the supreme court today did
George McDermott, an attorney for
the Kansas Natural receivers, learn
that the Bristow utilities commission
had filed a supplemental suit for more j
gas. McDermott had on VV ednesday
received from the commission the
j . . ., .
same statement made to the State
Journal that no suit would be filed,
"Was a supplemental petition for
more gas filed by the utilities com
mission ?" McDermott today asked
Herbert Armstrong, deputy clerk.
"Yes. Didn't you get notice of it?"
asked Armstrong.
"No, replied the lawyer. "I was
told that the case would not be filed.
I called up and asked about it and
was told that no such action was to be
taken."
Beasons for practicing deception in
misleading the State Journal were
clear. Just why the Bristow board
misinformed an attorney for the gas
receivers, however, is not explained.
In state house circles today there is
a new version of the recent move of
the Bristow commission in the gas
case. That is to the effect that the
suit for more gas had in good
faith been abandoned. Then the suit
was later filed to save the administra
tion publication from embarrassment
in the publication of a premature and
unjustified news item.

which betran this afternoon, opening

Luten royalties on Shawnee bridges i
have, in the past, totaled about S1.5UU j

has paid but very little of the money.
In the future the county commission- I
ers expect to pay none at all.
Tn the contracts- this afternoon there I
will be a clause whereby the contract
ors assume all expense and liabilities j
for patents and patent appliances used ;
on Shawnee county bridges: The !
commissioners have little doubt that j
the clause will leave Shawnee county j
in the clear. The insertion of the
clause followed a consultation of the i
commissioners and the attorney pen- i

of the county's assuming the liability
for the patents was threshed out.

Copenhagen, Jan. 7. Life for the
Ford peace party is just one threaten
ed lawsuit after another.
The Bennet, Tourist agency today
threatened to sue for 50,000 kroner
($13,500), alleging the Ford lieuten
ants cancelled reservations for a ship
voyage to The Hague, after getting
permission to travel by land through
Germany. They presented a "pay or
be sued" ultimatum, while Ford leaders-
were packing for the trip through
Germany. Rexford Holmes, discharged
head of the Ford crew of stenog
raphers, was still threatening suit for
slander today.
To add to the gayety of the party,
the Danish newspapers are printing
lurid reports about the Austro-Ameri-can

are growing very nervous over the
trip through Germany. They Tear

The cotton would be shipped. Pope
said, in ships owned by native Ameri

Only an order from Judge Pollock

Blew Open Safe; Get Away
With 300 Pounds Bulk.
St. Paul, Jan., 7. A million dollars
worth of internal revenue documen
tary stocks, weighing 300 pounds, and
between $4,000 and $5,000 in currency
were taken from the internal revenue
department here last night.
Police detectives expressed the be
lief that the robbery had been com
mitted at about 4 o'clock this morning
and that the robbers made their es
cape in an automobile. Both federal
and city authorities, however, profess
to have no tangible clue.
How the robbers entered the build
ing, located in the heart of St. Paul's
business district, is unknown. The
janitor, in opening the offices of the
department, discovered the theft. The
safe door was blown off. The tracks
of an automobile in the alley behind
the building lead the police to be
lieve that an automobile was used to
carry away the bulky stocks.
The robbers were apparently unable
to get away with $1,500 worth of
stamps which they took from the vault
and left in the building.
Immediately upon discovering the
robbery E. J. Lynch, revenue collector,
instigated an investigation. Collector
Lynch stated that the robbers- had
taker: negotiable stamps and had left
unnecotiable stamps in a large
amount. Federal agents and police
said the investigation indicated the
robbery had been planned carefully.
The robbers effected an entrance to
Mr. Lynch's office during the night.
They used ftn electric drill in opening
the outer door of the big vault. With
a charge of high explosives they blew
off the door. The second door of the
vault was opened by picking an ex
posed lock. The third door, that di
rectly guarding the large amount of
stamps, was unlocked, it is paid and
offered no resistance to the robbers.

Youngstown. Ohio. Jan. 7. Because
of strike rioting at the plant of the
Youngstown Sheet aivl Tube company.
Sheriff J. C. Umstead telegraphed to
Governor Willis today to inquire
whether state troops were available in
case they are needed to preserve order.
The sheriff at noon, however, ex
pressed the belief he would not need
the troops.
Rioting occurred here early todav
in connection with the strike at the
plant of the Youngstown Sheet and
Tithe company in East Youngstown.
One man was injured. Strike pickets
refused to permit workmen to enter
the piar.t. Those who attempted it
were greeted with showers of cobble
stones, bricks and clubs. Street cars
were stopped, workmen on board
dragged off and placed on cars going
in opposite directions. Stones were
thrown through car windows.
Today it was reported that a con
siderable quantity of fuse had been
stolen from a stone quarry near the
steel plant and officials fear dyna
miting may be attempted. The strike
forces have grown to 3.000.
Militia, to S-ene.
Governor Willis replied that he had
dispatched Brig. Gen. John C. Speakes
of Columbus, and Lieut. Col Charles
C. Weybrecht, of Alliance, to Youngs
town, and ordered them to have as
many companies as possible of the
Ohio National Guard ready for strike
duty.
