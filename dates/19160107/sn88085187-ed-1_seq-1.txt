AGED WIDOW HANGS HERSELF
¥
Prominent Woman Dies Under Northern Pacific Train
MANY
VIEW
FALL
PUTALLUP, Jan. 7.—ln the
aight of a mm" of spectators,
Mrs. M. F. Porter, wife of the
Puyallup city attorney, slipped
and fell to her death under the
wheels of a fast Northern Pa
cific train at the 7th street cross
ing here this morning.
The accident happened at 7:40
a. in as Mrs. Porter was on her
way to catch the Bhort Line inter
urban car for Seattle.
- Apparently she was not
■warned of the approach of the
train as she started to hurry
across the tracks. Suddenly her
foot slipped and she fell head
long across the rails.
Before any of the spectators
had time to go to her assistance
the train bore odwn upon her and
pased over her body, killing her
instantly.
Engineer Packard and Conduc
tor Lemon were in charge of the
train, which was bound for Ta
coma.
Mr. and Mrs. Porter had been
residents in Puyallup since 1 i>o4,
when they came to the coast
from Missouri. They were prom
inent in the civic and social life
of the city. Mrs. Porter was 49
years old. She is survived by
three brothers and three sisters
in the east.
RAIN OR
SNOW, IS
QUESTION
Now which should it do, snow
or rain?
That's the question which
bothered Tacoma all morning
long.
In Seattle it's raining; in Port
land it's snowing. It's raining on
the coast.
The weather man had almost
decided to have nothing to do
with anything that's doing in Se
atlte when, about 10:30, he it I
low 16 snow flakes to fall on Pa
cific avenue.
For a moment the follows that
Commissioner T. R. & P. Woods
has had shoveling melted slush
from the streets, sharpened up
their hopes for a continuation of
their jobs.
But just then the fire depart
ment rushed out on an alarm and
scared all the pep out of the
flakes.
The Puyallup river is up in the
air, too, and is still undecided
whether to spread itself out over
the valley.
All together it's quite unsatis
factory. The only thing that is
sure enough certain is wet feet.
And that means grippe.
Temperature, 38 in the shade,
and nothing but shade. Rain or I
snow? j
