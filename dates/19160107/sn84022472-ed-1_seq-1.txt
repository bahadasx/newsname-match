the infant from the board of chari
ties and go back to' Southingtoh where
they will reside in the future, f-
.". f : "When application for the child was
made at the office of Supt. Gordon,
the latter stoutly refused to turn the
child over to its parents, saying -that
the mother -of the child was not fit,
in his opinion to be entrusted with the
!. youngster and that until such time as
he saw fit to "surrender the young
ster to its parents, it must remain in
charge of ..the department of public
. charities - UT ' '
. When informed of this the parents
" were- indignant and threatened to
bring suit against the city of Bridge
port and have the matter threshed out
. in the superior court. This would ne
cessitate the arrest of Spencer B.. 6or.
don under habeas corpus proceedings.
-'After the finding of the two weeks
-'old babe it was turned over to the
authorities at the Bridgeport hospital
as a, charge on the city, but has since
been placed in a private home and
; is listed as a city pauper." .... '
When th father of the child was
interviewed as to what action would
be taken on' the refusal of Gordon to
give him charge of his son, he was
rather . reticent and did not care to
' discuss the subject other than to say
that he would see that he obtained the
' boy and . that the matter will rest in
the hands of iis lawyer in Southing-
ton; , .-', . , ': ,.-'.'
' The dispute has eaused considerable
discussion about the court rooms and
some lawyers even went so far- as1 to
recommend that the father use' . phy
sical prowess to obtain the child"
claiming that as he is the rightful
, parent no man has any right to keep
, his father from him and that law will
.. not uphold Gordon in his action..

One of Defendants at Fin
. al Session.
. New York, Jan. 7 A verdict Is ex
pected before nightfall in the trial
of the eleven former : directors of the
New York, New Haven & Hartford
railroad, who have been on trial for
three" months; charged with criminal
violation of the Sherman anti-trust
law.
, The charge of Judge Hunt covered
many legal points in , the case, and'
his rulings were received with the
utmost interest. jAt the conclusion
of his address, the' jury took the case.
"William Rockefeller was the . only
defendant not in court when Judge
Hunt, began his remarks. The charge
against the defendants being a mis
demeanor; theirpresence was not le
gally required. Charles S. Melleh was
in court sitting in the spectators' box.
, The court, after- describing the in
dictment, first instructed -the Jury
that, the case should be. considered
without regard to any testimony that
would indicate "any attempts to in
fluencelegislation by bribery or cor
rupt means." . . -
The , indictment contained no such
charge, he said. Discussing tne, Kner
man act, he said that 'it did hot pre
scribe a limit to acquisitions and that
large ; enterprises may in' a certain
sense" b permitted to monopolize com
merce. Magnitude of business was
not in-Jtself a violation of a law.
' Thecourt held that the charge also
could not be sustained unless the 3ury
was satisfied that the defendants or
any pt them "intended to enter an
illegal combination." Intent, he said,
was "psychological and not to be as
certained; by fixed rule of law.".1 The
Jury would' have to determine it by
facte and circumstances.
Judge Hunt instructed the, Jury
that the so-called -tripartite agreement
between the New. York . Central, the
Newv Haven and the New York- &
Harlem in the early nineties was not a
violation of the Sherman act. i

ed in violence, the Russians Jhavmg
ceased to attack with' vigor between
the Pripet and, the Besabarian fron
tier. -The only gain officially announc
ed for the Russians yesterday! was
at Czartorysk the scene of many san
guinary struggles where, it is said the
Austrians were driven from the ceme
tery. An advance in this region will
threaten Kovel, one of the strongest
Austro-tJerman positions. it is De-
lieved that eyeh though no further
gains should be made Russia s rorces
have attained a position, which will
give the nation a degree of1 power in
the Balkan af fairs it has not had since
its armies were driven back from the
