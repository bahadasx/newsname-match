St. Paul, Jan. 7.—Between $600 and
$5,000 In cash, and approximately $1,
000,000 In negotiable internal revenue
stamps, were stolen from the old fed
eral building here some time last
night by robbers who blew the vault.
The robbery was not discovered until
this morning.
The police of St. Paul and Minne
apolis, and the state authorities, join
ed with federal agents in an effort to
hunt down the robbers.
At the same time, E. J. Lynch, rev
enue collector, with his office staff,
went to work to check over the con
tents of the office to determine the
exact amount secured by the rob
bers.
The robbery was one of the boldest
and most successful ever executed

The police are baffled in their en
deavor to get a clue. This afternoon
they knew no more than when they
started to work at 10 o'clock this
morning.
Telegrams sent broadcast to the po
lice of hundreds of cities, telling
them of the robbery, and asking im

the search. Railroad detectives join
ed in searching the outgoing trains.
The lodging house district, saloons
and smaller hotels in St. Paul and

Slayer of Montana Man De
lays Trip to Scaffold a
Month.
Winnipeg, Man., Jan. 7.—Prepara
tions had been nearly completed at
Regina for the hanging of George
Bail following his sentence received
at Swift Current on Friday, October
15, when at the request of the United
States government a reprieve was
granted. Governor Kennedy bad his
workmen erecting the scaffold Just
outside the prison. door in the yard
of the Regina jail and within sight
of the condemned man. There were
just a few details left and the whole
structure would have been ready. The
official hangman arrived in Regina on
Monday and paid two visits to the
jail to look after the erection of the
scaffold.
When the governor announced the
contents of the telegram to Ball in
his cell, the man appeared to be quite
relieved and said, "if they hang me
they are hanging an innocent man."
George Ball was convicted of the
murder of William Long of
Mont., and the sittings of the district
court in Swift Current last October
J. F. Bryant who defended the con
victed man, put bp one of the best
defenses for his client, but evidence
went against him and the jury re
turned a verdict of guilty, whereupon
Judge Newlands sentenced Ball to
hang on January 6. The telegram
received yesterday has postponed the
date to February. 7... Long was a
ranchcr. The shooting affair occurred
early in April, 1915, on Ball's ranch
in the Wood Mountain district, near
the international boundary line, -.
The plea of self-defense was urged
at the trial and strong evidence was

Affidavits.
OFFICIALS ARE
STILL UNINFORMED
Situation Placed Before the
Cabinet in its Meeting
Today.
Washington, Jan. 7.—Consul Gar
rels at Alexandria, Egypt, advised the
.state department that he had secured
affidavits from 21 survivors of the
Persia, including Charles H. Grant,
an American citizen, and that all con
firmed previous statements that "no
warning was given and no vessel was
seen."
Without Information.
The Austro-Hungarian government,
until yesterday, was without informa
tion concerning the sinking of the
Persia, according to a cable received
by the state department from Ambas
sador Penfleld at Vienna.
Ambassador Penfteld's dispatch,
dated yesterday, contained the only
information in response to his inquiry
as to whether the Austro-Hungarian
government had knowledge of the
sinking of the Persia, and if so, what
the circumstances were. The officers
and crew of the Persia, the consul
said, have left Alexandria for Eng
land, where their affidavits probably
will be obtained on arrival.
Still Uncertain.
The submarine crisis, still of un
certain status because of the lack of
details, was today placed by Presi
dent Wilson before the cabinet in its
first meeting since his return from
Hot Springs, Va.
The senate foreign relations com
mittee also met to consider the situa
tion. but as Chairman Stone was de
tained at the white house by a con
ference with the president, it ad
journed without action.
Although more than a week has
elapsed since the steamship Persia
was sunk in the Mediterranean with
the loss of American life, officials are
still uninformed as to whether the
vessel was torpedoed and if so, the
nationality of the submarine.

Passage of Measure on First
Reading Yesterday Fol
lows Lengthy Debate.
London, Jan. 7.—That a general
election will be the very last measure
resorted to by the government to ob
tain the desired "general consent" to
the establishment of an attentuated
form of compulsion, provided for in
the pending military service bill,
seems to be little doubted.
That such general consent could be
obtained by an appeal to the country
was admitted by virtually every one,
but the belief is expressed in many
quarters that it can be won' without
such upheaval.
The West Minster Gazette, empha
sizing that fact that only 45 members
of the house of commons opposed the
measure, thinks the minority can be
convinced of the necessity of enacting
the law. and that the threat of nation-
bate in the latter stages of the bill's
course through. parliament.
London. Jan. 7.—Amid scenes of
wild enthusiasm, the house of com
mons last night passed the first read
ing of the government bill for com
pulsory military service, by the de
cisive-vote of 403 to 106. The vote
seems to presage the passage of the
bill.
The vote came shortly before mid
night with the galleries again packed,
every seat on the flOor of the house
occupied, the ministerial benches flll
1 ed and an air of eager expectancy pre
vailing.
Balfour Closes.
A. J. Balfour, first lord of the ad
miralty, closed the debate in behalf
of the government, and he did it in a
persuasive appeal of half an hour
which roused the lagging spiritB of the
advocates of the bill and turned the
tide of adversity which had been run
ning steadily agalnBt the measure
through the debate.and the outside
events of the day.
"Let this vote tonight show that Ye
are a unift®
appeal. "Abandon your abtitracl
theories and remember we are dealing
with stern realities which call for
great sacrifices."
Cheer the Result.
Then came the vote. The an
nouncement of the figures was re
ceived with a tremendous outburst of
cheering.
Scores of members in khaki waved
their handkerchiefs and the air waa
rent with white papers flung in tri
umph at the government's success.
An. analysis of the vote showed that
the government had held- the great
bulk of the liberal and conservative
vote. The Irish nationalists had voted
against the bill, but the Irish unionists
•supported the measure. The minor
ity" showed a sprinkling of liberal
members.
Three Resign.
London. Jan. 7.—Arthur Hender-v
son, president of the board of educa
tion and leader of the labor party in
the house of commons, Wm. Braco,
parliamentary undersecretary for
home affairs, and Geo. H. Roberts,
lord commissioner of the treasury, al
so labor party leaders, have resigned
from the ministry. The resignations
of Henderson, Brace and Roberts
were the direct outcome of the la
bor congress here yesterday.
It is understood that Mr. Hender
son will take an early opportunity to
explain his position to the house of
commons.
There are now four •vacancies in the
coalition ministry, including that
caused by the resignation of Sir John
A. Simon, the home secretary.
Labor Opposes.
London, Jan. 7.—Organized labor
of Great Britain, sitting in confer
ence in London, today decided against
the government's compulsion bill by
the overwhelming majority of 1,988,
000 votes to 783,000.
Hostility to the government's meas
ure was uncompromising and necessi
tated the resignation from the coali
tion ministry of all three labor mem
bers: Arthur Henderson, Wm. Brace
and Geo. H. Roberts.
In addition to the formal vote
against the government's compulsion
bill the congress. rejected by four to
one a motion pledging support to the
principle of compulsion of single men,
and passed by two to one another
motion directing th»* labor party to
oppose the bill in all its stages in the
house of commons..
Arthur Henderson and his two min
or labor colleagues will remain in
the labor party and retain their seats
in parliament.

STEEL WORK IN
THE FAR NORTH
Winnipeg, Man.. Jan. S.—Word
comes from the far north that grading
on the Hudson Bay Railway, the gov
ernment owned road, has reached a
point 35 miles front the Bay. Steel
is within 190 miles of the terminus,
but is stopped there owing to the con
struction of a huge steel bridge which
will not be completed until early in
the spring. J. D. McArthur, the con
tractor, has recently returned from a
trip of inspection along the line. He
says the steel will be laid to the Bay
by early next fall. The line will then
be ready to handle traffic. Men will
be kept on the work all winter. The
force will materially be increased
when spring comes. There is much
bridge building to be done, as the
country toward the end of the line is
very wet, with rivers and streams run
ning in all directions.
WILL NOTlxESTROY
AMERICAN INDUSTRY
New Tork. Jan. 7.—Persons who

cheap foreign-made goods after the
European war were described as pes
simistic prophets of evil by Secretary
Daniels of the navy in a speech here
last night at the annual banquet of
the 8ociety of Automobile Engineers.
"I would be ashamed," he said, "to
believe that, with a large portion of
the European workers killed in bat
tle and more maimed and crippled,
American able-bodied men trembled
for fear they would be ruined by such
competition when the war ends. And
I would be more ashamed if I did
not believe that the American govern
ment could be depended upon in any
such remote emergency to preserve
American commerce from any unfair
practices of other nations following
the war without the necessity of re
turning to a tariff system enacted for
the fat fryers."

Although the *itj$ation around
Czernowitz ihas not yet been cleared
up officially, it appears from advices
from Russian sources- that the Aus
trians are hard pressed over a long
strike at the Kolmea-Stanislau-Hallcz
line, where powerful defensive works
have been in preparation for some
time by the Austro-Germans.
Meanwhile, the Russian position
250 miles further north on the Middle
Styr river has been greatly strength
ened by successful operations in the
region of the great marshes, where
the Russians are beginning to emerge
with prospects of being able to use
the roads leading either northwest,
west or southwest.
The interest in, the fate of Serbia's
refugee army was shown by the
question asked in the house of com
mons Thursday: "Whether a consider
able part of the Serbian army is in
distress at Scutari and whether his
majesty's government wtll oifer the
Serbian army some suitable locality
in the Mediterranean where the men
may rest and recuperate?"
In reply, Lord Robert Cecil, under
secretary for foreign affairs, said there
was a considerable body of the Ser
bian army at Scutari, where at first
the men had been in great distress.
But the situation, he added, had now
been largely relieved.
Telegrams from Athens say the
number of Serbian refugees in Greek
territory is now 40,000, of whom 6,000
are at 9aloniki.
