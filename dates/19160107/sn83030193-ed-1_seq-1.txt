QUICK TRANSFER OF
$100,000 TO CHILD
WELFARE BOARD
Result of Evening World Fight
Shown by Estimate
Board Action.
As a result of the fight made by Tho
nvcnlng World for the .rcioafiq of
funds necessary to provide help for
thousands of fatherless children In
this city, the Hoard of Ksllmato to
day suddenly and unexpected trans
ferred $100,000 from tho Department
of Charities to the Hoard of Child
Welfare. That it Is a result of the
oxposurcs published In theso columns,
showing how tho Charity Trust has
been Interfering with tho child welfare
work, Is best evidenced by tho fact
that tho transfer was not down on
tho calendar. It was an eleventh
hour action, so to speak, to hush the
criticism ot the olllclals caused on
all sides by the articles In Tho Kve
nlng World.
It was explained that tho $100,000,
while in tho Charities Department
budget for 1916, in reality was ap
propriated for child welfare, work.
Just why It waa placed under tho
direct Jurisdiction of tho Charities
Department, of which Commissioner
John A. Kingsbury in the head, Is
not 311. 'id c clear.
It was shown in theso columns
that despite tho fact that the new
law authorising tho existence of a
t mill Wolfait) Hoard guarantees i'
Independence of "prlvato charity."
Commissioner Kingsbury, formerly
employed by a privatn charities or
ganization, consulted ottlclals of tuch
organisations ubout his work in Cm
Child Welfare Hoard.
Now that money haH been rele.ie
for tho proper care of the thousands
of children who nro entitled to assist
ance under tho Child Welfare law.
u light will be. made to avert tne in
fluence of tho Charity Trust. If noc
essary. Mayor Mltchcl will be asked
to take a dellnlto ntuml in thn matter.

OSSININCJ. Jan. 7. The attempted
cscapo of a prisoner throw Into painful
' confusion the carefully prepared plans
for the execution of Antonio Ponton In
i the death house of Sine Sing prison
Just before dawn to-day.
Tho emotional cITcct of the delay and
'excitement upon tho wltncajeaand tho
officials who had ttecled themselves for
the ordeal won such that most of them
wcro In a partly hysterical stato after
Ponton had been killed. Deputy War-
i Jl,n Miller broko down and sobbod out
an Impassioned protest against capital
punishment; Stato Executioner IIul
bet t was taken violently 111 and Is now
under treatment in tho ' -Ison hospital.
All tho wltncKsos and ofilclals had
been gathered In the Warden's offlco
and Principal Keeper Dorner had
gone to tho door to load tho way
down tlio ateps to tho death chambor
when ho was hurriedly called to tbo
outer oillco by tho alarm that a
prisoner had nscapod.
There was a hurrying and scurrying
of kceporw from all parts of the build
ings and tho enclosure, which nrousod
all th. prisoners. Tho chaso led to
tho roof. For half an hour tho
tramping and scuffling of fcot upon
the roof was henrd. A brief .fllcnco
followed.
KIRCHWEY AND DEPUTY WOULD
NOT WITNESS DEATH.
Warden Klrchwey was not at tho
prison, following the precedent of his
produeessor, Thomas) Molt Osborne, In
htaying away as a proton against
capital punishment. Mis duties tell
upon Miller, who has Just as tcudor
Ivellngs as his superior, and so far
feared his self control that he tefuaed
to go to thu il 0.1 tli 1 iuuo aud delogatcd
his duties to Dornor.
Deputy Miller returned to the -ttar-tied
witnesses as soon an ho learned
what the troublo was and explained
tho situation. Two convicts, one of
thorn Harry Miller, alias Edward Hill,
were rolcasod from tholr cells at half
past 5 o'clock to go to the bakbry to
carry tho bread for breakfast to tho
tr.css hall. Under the routine all tho
other cells remain closed until tbo
rlflomnn who guard tho wall turrets
have been exchanged. During the ex

AVOIDS A DIRECT DISAVOWAL
Count Von Bernstorff Delivers to
Lansing Germany's Proposal to
End Controversy Over Sinking of
Liner Concedes All Points.
- - i
INDEMNITY TO
FOR THE LOSS OF LIFE
WASHINGTON', Jan. 7. Count von Bernstorff, the German
Ambassador, presented to Secretary Lanslnc to-dav a nronosal to mv
Indemnity for Americans, lost in the
uuue mat cumrovcrsy, ana gave assurances mat no German submarines
in the Mediterranean would attack non-combatant ships of any character
without warning or destroy them without opportunity for non-combatants
to reach a place of safety.
While offering to pay indemnity in the Lusitania case, Germanv
nukes the reservation that it is done without admission of wrong doing.
No official indication was given as to the acceptability of the proposal,
but one set of American officials took the view that it would end the
controversy.
Hie assurance, regarding submarine warfare in the .Mediterranean
are of broader scope than those given after the Arabic disaster, and
covering the warfare in (lie North Sea. The latter guaranteed only the
safety of "liners." Those for the Mediterranean cover all non-combatant
ships.
It was also staled with authority to-day that Germany virtually
had agreed with the position of the United States in regard to small
boats not being, under all conditions, a place of safety for passengers
aboard a ship about to be destroyed. These last concessions ant under
stood to have Iwen contained in the last note from Germany regarding
the sinking of the ship William P. Hrye.
The communication readied the State Department several weeks
ago, but lias been withheld from publication on the ground that it had a
certain bearing upon the Lusitania negotiations. Germany is understood
to have fully agreed with the American point ot view.
