GERMANYMAKES
NEW PROPOSAL
Hopes to End Lusitania Con
troversy Will Pay Indem
nity For Lost Americans.
ACT OF REPRISAL
No Wrong-Doing on Part of
Germans Only Retalia
tion For British
Blockade.
Washington, Jan. 7. Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador,
presented to Secretary Lansing today
a proposal to pay indemnity for
Americans lost in tho Lusitania dis
aster and thereby conclude that con
troversy and gave assurances that
any German submarines in the Med
iterranean would not attack non-combatant
ships of any character without
warning or destroy them without op
portunity for non-combatants to
reach a place of safety.
While offering to pay indemnity in
the Lusitania case, Germany makes
the reservation that it is done with
out admission of wrong-doing. No of
ficial indication was given as to the
acceptability of the proposal but one
set of American officials took the
view that it would end the controver
sy The assurances regarding subma
rine warfare In the Mediterranean are
of broader scope than those given aft
er the Arabic disaster, and covering
the warfare in tho North sea. The
latter guaranteed only the safety
of liners. Those for the Mediterrean
cover all non-combatant ships.
The assurances regarding the con
duct of submarine warfare in the
Mediterranean convey the first in
formation thnt German submarines
were operating there. In excluding
all ships except liners from the as
surances covering submarine warfare
in the North sea, the German govern
ment was reported as considering that
no Americans could possibly be aiboard
ships other than liners In regular passenger-carrying
service.
Count Bernstorff's Plan.
It has been known for some time
. that Count von Bernstorff had de
vised a plan which he believed would

YOUNG VANDERBILT
MANAGES REUNION
Cornelias Vanderbilt, Jr.
Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr., son of
Air. and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt,
managed the reunion last week of
the Knickerbocker Greys, a military
drill class composed of wealthy
young men. This class, which meets
twice a week for military drill wa3
established by some of New York's
most prominent men, and has some
very famous names on its member
ship rolL
trovers'. He was understood to have
submitted the proposition to the Ber
lin foreign office before Christmas.
There was some delay because of ad
verse sentiment created by the re
quest for the dismissal of' the Ger
man naval and military attaches, and
the demands in the first American
note to Austria-Hungary on the sink
ing of the Italian liner Ancona.
As for the disavowal asked by the
United States, the German govern
ment was reported as considering that
the most effective form of disavowal
was assurances that such acts should
not be committed in the future. The
assurances regarding the conduct of
German submarines in the Mediter
ranean were understood to be nearly
identical with those contained in Aus
tria renly-to -the last American-note
on the Ancona.
Lansing Issues Statement.
The following statement was later
issued by Secretary Lansing:
"The German ambassador today left
at the department of state under in
structions from his government the
following communication:
" '1, German submarines in the
Mediterranean had, from the begin
ning, orders to conduct cruiser war
fare against enemy merchant vessels
only in accordance with general prin
ciples of international law and in par
ticular measures of reprisals as ap
plied in tho war zone around the Brit
ish Isles were to be excluded.
" '2 German submarines are there
fore permitted to destroy enemy mer
chant vessels in the Mediterranean
i.e., passenger as well as freight ships
as 'far as they do not try to escape or
offer resistance only after passeng
ers and crews have been, accorded
safety.
" '3 All cases of destruction of en
emy merchant ships in tho Mediter
ranean in which German submarines
are concerned arc made tho subject of
official Investigation and besides sub
mitted to regular prize court proceed
ings. Insofar us American interests
are concerned, the German govern
ment will communicate the result to
the American government. Thus, also
in the Persia case, if the circumstan
ces call for it.
" '4 If commanders of Gorman sub
marines should not have obeyed the
orders given to them, they will be pun
ished; furthermore, the German gov
ernment will make reparation for
damage caused by death of or injuries
to American citizens ' "
Mr Lansing made -no announce
ment of tho Lusitania proposals, say
ing the subject still was confidential.
Tho Fryo note dealing with the
small boat question will be made pub
lic later.

OF SERBIAN ARMY
Men Crawl on All Fours Along
Edges of Terrible Precipices
and Sides of Peaks.
HAD TO DESTROY GUNS
Live Without Bread For Days
Horrible Suffering From
Cold and Hunger.
Paris. Jan. 6, 10:40 p. m. Hardships
encountered by the Serbian .army in
its flight through the mountains of
Albania, are described in a letter to
the Temps sent from Scutarla on Dec.
11.
"This is the sixth capital Serbia has
had during two months," says the
writer. "After Nish it was Kralieve,
then Raska, Mitrovitza, Prlsrend and
finally Scutari.
"As a tourist I am acquainted with
the Alps, the Carpathians and the
Pyrenees, but I have never seen such
goat paths 'for roads running along
the edges of terrible precipices and
the sides of peaks In the clouds. The
officials of the Serbian government
rode little mountain ponies, but often
they had to abandon their mounts and
go on foot. I' have seen their horses
slip and fall into abysses. Sometimes
one had to go on all fours. Some, to
nvold vertigo, had to be guided with
closed eyes.
Snow a Yard Deep.
"Then there was snow which caused
fresh suffering. Roads were worn
through the snow a yard deep. Al
banian guerrilas were taking pot shots
at us from behind rocks high up or
from opposite sides of the canfbnB.
"The army could not bring its guns
or convoys through such country.
When we began to enter It we had to
destroy automobiles, wagons, vehicles
and every sort of gun. Officers and
soldiers wept as they demolished the
guns, those pieces of steel which they
called their 'French friends' the ord
nance having been made at Creusot,
The men had become attached to
them and many artillerists served the
same gun for years. Some officers
refused to destroy their pieces, saying
they preferred to use their last bit of
strength in trying to save them; and
some of them have succeeded and
actually have brought their guns
across.
Many Soldiers larefoot.
"After all these" suYferingsfrom
cold, lninger and fatigue, many sold
iers being barefoot, we are here.
"Altogether there have arrived by
various routes G.000 women and chil
dren. The tragedy of the situation is
that the army has almost nothing to
eat. The soldiers had no bread for
four days, but small quantities of
flour were kept for the women and
children "

Scientific Congress last night in
which ho outlined tlje government's
plan for an Pan-American alliance
guaranteeing absolute political inde
pendence and territorial integrity was
favorably commented on by delegates
today.
Tho United States proposes, the
president said, that all the American
nations shall agree to settle all pend
ing boundary disputes as soon as pos
sible by amiable process and to dis
pose of all disputes in the future by
arbitration. Furthermore, all coun
tries under the plan would agree that
no revolutionary expedition shall bo
outfitted against, or supplies for revo

states.
Announcement of the selection of.
Lima, Peru, as the meeting place of
the next congress in 1921 was regard
ed by the delegates as an evidence
of the desire for closer relations
among the American republics.
Sessions of the various sections or

LONDON REGRETS
DEFEAT OF BILL
Single Stroke Breaks Up Union
of Parties When Conscrip
tion Bill Comes Up.
AGAINST COMPULSION
Positive Evidence of Necessity
of Arbitrary Enlistment
Is Demanded.
London, Jan. 7, 11:25 a. m. The
Manchester Guardian expressed regret
that the first result of the project of
compulsory military service is a'
breaking up of the union of parties
which, however, checked by some un
towered events, nevertheless, helped
to keep a united nation concentrated
on a single object from the outbreak
of the war to the present day. U
says:
"This break up was announced by a
massive majority against the govern
ment bill at the great labor confer
ence yesterday and Is signalllzed by
the prompt resignation of three labor
ministers. Of the three parties form
ing the coalition, one has thus with
drawn. Of the other two parties, one
distinguished member has withdrawn
while a material proportion of the rank
and file will go with him".
"The government has at a stroke
become again a party government al
though the party Is new In politics,
and a definite and regular opposition
emerges at the same moment. Such
are the consequences, deeply regret
able, of which many of us have con
sistently warned the government
since the concriptionist agitation be
gan." The Guardian demands positive evi
dence that compulsion is necessary,
saying at the same time that the na
tional cause is paramount over other
considerations. It says that the fig
ures of the Derby recruiting cam
paign as given out by the government
do not convince it, as they have not
convinced the labor party These fig
ures, the Guardian contends, have
made out a case for further examina
tion rather than for action without
examination.

New York, Jan 7. In that portion
of Belgium, which remains free from
German occupation, and which ap

Belgian.
Before leaving "for Washington, the
Chevalier Van De Yyere said.
"In addition to these residents and
refugees, we have In our small bit

are so over-crowded with civilians,
for in such a place, with the awful
ruin from burning and shooting, we
have man j' epidemics. There has
been typhoid to an alarming extent
and will be more when spring comes."
Milk Supply Exhausted.
The Belgian minister said that he
received yesterday a cable dispatch
saying that the supply of condensed
milk in Belgian is now exhausted
"We do not easily what you Ameri
cans call 'snuear but this means dis

ships they suffered during the five lH
weeks that the Thessaloniki was bat- IH

On Christmas Day, passengers said, M
the supply of meat on the Thessalonl- H

gallons of water were left and the M
ship's officers began to portion out M
short rations of the meager supply of M
food which remained. M
Sprung Leak In Hurricane. H
The Thessaloniki first sprung a leak M
when she encountered a hurricane
Inch raged for 12 hours on December IH
31. The boiler and engine rooms IH
were partly flooded and the steamer M
sent out calls for assistance. After H
the hurricane subsided, however, the M
flooded portions of the 'ship were H
pumped out and she proceeded on her H
voyage. H
Rough seas and gales were encount- H
ered 'from December 22 to December H
2G when the Thessaloniki ran into a H
90 mile hurricane which lasted for H
2'l hours. Many of the passengers IH
and crew Teared the steamer was sink-
ing, as fresh leaks opened up, the IH
boiler and engine rooms and coal M
bunkers rapidly filled with water and M
the ship was badly tossed about. M
It was then that the Thessaloniki H
sent out numerous S. O. S. calls which H
were heard by the Patris, United H
States. Florizel and other steamers. H
The Florizel was the first to reach H
the disabled vessel and offered to take M
off the passengers and crew and car- H
ry them to Bermuda. Captain Gou- H

age as a master, declined this offer H
The Florizel stood by until the Pat- c H
ris came in, sight, H

After the transfer the Patris shot a H

sister ship in tow on January. The H
