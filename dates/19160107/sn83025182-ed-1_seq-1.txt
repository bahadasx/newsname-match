N0W YORK, Jan. 7r-When 177
{nssengers of th» abandoned Greek
liner Thessalonika, together with two
of the crew landed her* today frqpi
the steamship PlLtgla, they told a vtvld
story of their sufferings at sea and of
a mutiny aboard the Thessalonika, in
which all but three of the vessel's
complement turned a*ainst Captain
Oouiandls.
The steerage passenger* led the op
position to Captain Goulandis and on
the night of December 26, stormed the
orldge as the vessel tossed helpless
ly in a torriflo storm, only to find the
ship's commander sleeping soundly,
one passenger said. Captain Ooulan
4is repelled the paasengsra, driving
them below.
William Williams, tor three years a
Keinber of the second United States
Rivalry, on ^nty oa tha Dordnr, acted
as tpo^stnil for-(lis passengers to
day. Williams returned to Oreece to
visit his mother and embarked at
Athens, November 16.
"On December 21, -we ran Into a
hurricane which started some of the
trail plates, causing water to flood the
engine room," said Williams. "The
leak was not serious, however, and the
crew soon pumped 'out the engines.
"The trouble began on December 22,
when a second storm overtook the
Thessalonika. The steamship Stam
falia of the Italian line answered our
calls for help and stood by. WHen
Captain Goulandis refused to allow a
transfer of passengers, the steerage
passengers went above and demanded
that the Stampalla tow us to port.
The captain refused and as the Stam
palla steamed away, tfie steerage pas
sengers gathered on the wave-swept
deok about a little altar and prayed
all night long, led by' Father Rallis
Traltos. Christmas was pleasant and
clear, but all hands were nearly fam

Dlsouaaion of the Egyptian cam

for several week* was revived today
by statements in the English preas
deriding the possibility that Germany
could hold her lines elsewhere and
send troops to the 8uez.
It was pointed out here that the
Turks now have an army of more
than 1,000,000 men in the field. With
in a short time they will be well
equipped. It Is understood that Ger
man officers who have lived In Egypt
and understand the problems of an
Egyptian campaign, -will be assigned
to the Invading armies.
It is now possible for the Germans
to send supplies to Constantinople
and thenoe to Damascus within a
short time. Within a few days a new

ing fast trains running from Berlin
to Constantinople in thirty-nine hours.
Before the war, the trip took fifty
nine hours. Improvements on the
Serbian portion of the road by Ger
man englnere has made It possible
to reduce the time.
Retirement of the alliee from a part
of their positions at the Dardanelles
is characterized by German military
men as only another Indication of
the haphazard policy of the entente
powers In the far east.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 7.—Cabinet
and congressional councils today con
sidered Americu's policy regarding
the sinking of the liner Persia. At
the first cabinet meeting in a month,
the president and Secretary Lansing
presented the scant evidence gathered
regarding the catastrophe. The sen
ate and house foreign committees,
meeting for the first time since recon
vening of congress, took up the Persia
incident informally and mapped out a
plan of co-operation with the white
house and state department.
All officials admitted this govern
ment's hands are tied until further
evidence ie produced. This is hoped
for from Austria, following Ambassa
dor Penfield's request to the Vienna
office. Officials declared it unthink
able Austria would deny responsibil
ity or withhold evidence if one of hy
submarines reports torpedoing the
Persia. They expect also that Austria
with such an admission, would volun
teer a disavowal and repudiate the
commander's action, unless evWence
could be offered to show the Persia
sought to flee or by being armed, ren
dered herself subject to unwarned at-1
tacks. The latter suggestion might
bring to a head the whole question of
arming merchant vessels. Failure to
hear from the "country," it was
learned today, and counsel of many
congressional leaders, is causing the
president to go slow. Practically no
communications have reached the

NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE
TO SEND A PROTEST
American viewpoint has been given
the president in part, however,
through advice of various senators
and representatives. The whits house,
feels that such expressions are a
gauge of national sentiment.
At today's cabinet and congressional
committee meetings,1 steps toward the
following policies were considered: A
full understanding with the central
powers regarding future submarine
warfare. A declaration that if an
American traveling on an unarmed
ship (providing flight is not attempt
ed) is injured or Jeopardized by un
dersea attack, the nation whose com
mander makes the attack must ac
cept responsibility.
A caution to Americans to select
with care vessels on which they travel
and avoid as far as possible, involv
ing tiie government.
Officials base considerable hofle for
avoidance of a serious clash with
Austria over the unofficial promise of
Austrian Charge Zwiedinek that his
government, if responsible for the
Persia's loss, will do everything re
quired in disavowal, reparation and
punishment of the commander.
No Submarine Seen.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7.—American
Consul Oarrels, Alexandria, Egypt, to
day cabled the state department he
had affidavits from Charles H. Grant,
an American, and twenty other sur
vivors of the sinking of the liner Pei^
sia, saying the vessel was sunk with
out warning and that no submarine
was seen.
The officers and crew of the Persia
sailed for England before affidavits
could be secured. It is thought pos
sible at the department of state that
they wished to confer with the Brit
ish admiralty before making any
sworn statements.
