APPRECIATIONS
Ii writing the Western Liberal
from Brnckman, Nick Powers says
of our Holiday and Mining Edi
tion: "I have been taking the Lib
eral for ten years but when I re
ceived your big edition I received
such a shock, that had I been sub
ject to heart trouble, I would have
dropped dead. It took my breath
away bo that the Railroad Com
pany docked me for the time it
took to catch it again. Lthought
I had gotten ahold of the New
York Herald when I Raw the edi
tion. It was good work, Mr. Edi
tor." From Mrs. N. W. Shine of Suis
uin, Calif., we received the fol
lowing letter:
"Editor of Liberal,
Lordsburg, N. M.
"Dear Sir: I wish to thank you
for the Christmas edition of your
paper. Lordsburg may well be
proud of such an up-to-date, newsy
paper, and energetic editor. It has
been several years since I was in
Lordsburg but I have many friends
there; and am delighted the town
is making such rapid progress. I
trust you will accept my best
wishes for a prosperous year for
your paper and town in 1916.
Yours truly,
Mrs. M. W. Shine".
From the extreme north of New
Mexico, miles from a railroad, lives
a mining engineer and writer nam
ed Norman L. Faris. Mr. Faris
was among the hundreds of mining
men to whom the Liberal's Mining
Review was sent. This week a
dommunication was received from
him. It reads as follows:
"The receipt of the Christmas
and Mining Edition of the Liberal
is herewith acknowledged. Many
thanks. It is a credit to the state
of New Mexico as well as Lords
burg. Judging from the amount
of local advertising, journalism
should be remunerative in your
country. Wishing you all the joys
of the season and great prosperity
in 1916, I remain,
Yours very truly,
Norman L. Faris,
Ute Park, N. M.
Mrs. Overton left Saturday for
Los Angeles, Calif., where she
will make her home, having dis
posed of her interests at the 85
mine camp. Mrs. Overton has a
large circle of friends in Lords
burg who wish her prosperity at
her new location.

As a result of the Western Lib
eral's incorporation stand one of
our advertisers came in, paid us
up and demanded that we cut out
his ad. j
So it is evident that the non
incorporators are going to take it
out on the Liberal.
WHY NOT HERE?
The following thrilling article
appeared in the Deming Headlight
last week. It brings to mind the
fact that Lordsburg has not had
an event of this nature for some
time and by publishing this news
it is trusted that the boys will
awaken :
"One of the liveliest entertain
ments provided for the people of
Deming on Christmas day was a
series of badger fights that were
pulled off in Charlie Hubbard's
wagon yard in Gold avenue.
This was not the usual badger
fight, where the unsuspecting vic
tim is persuaded to drag a piece of
obscene earthenware from a box
after the bets are all up, and where
he is compelled, by the rules of the
game, to set up the refreshments
for the crowd. This was a real
badger that had been captured on
the Mimbres and was turned over
to Mr. Hubbard to be used in mak
ing a Deming Holiday.
In all, about six dogs tried con
clusions with the badger, one of
J. S. Fielder s Airedales putting up
a splendid fight. In the afternoon
John Toot's bulldog made the best
showing, while Clem Holderby's
dog also had 'the best of his round
with the badger. The fights in
the morning were witnessed by a
small and select crowd, but after
the word had gone around that
there were to be more fights in
the afternoon that mob that was on
hand to witness the fun was so
great that only a few of them were
able to get close enough to see
what was happening. Fair women
and brave men were present in
abundance, while all classes, in
cluding the pulpit, the press and
the police were represented. Even
if the majority were not able to
see much of the fight everybody
had a hilariously good time.
Efforts are being made to find
further opponents for the badger
so that his stay in Deming may be
made as interesting as possible

Sayings About
What About the Light riant?
Editor the Western Liberal
Sir I should like to know, and
a large number of our citizens
must know, before Lordsburg Is
incorporated, why the electric
light plant and water plant -were
not included in the intended Incor
poration area. It is Btrange that a
certain piece of land to the west
of town has been mentioned on the
petitions in circulation, which land
has absolutely nothing upon it but
sage brush, and a portion of land
within 200 yards of the business
portion of the town, upon which
stands the Lordsburg Electric
Light plant and the water plant
which are estimated to cost $45,
000, are quietly omitted. Some of
the people who have signed the pe
titions favoring incorporation say,
"Why, you can take in as much ter
ritory as you want to after the
place is incorporated."
Did ever anyone hear such in
sane talk as this? That there is a
"dark horse" in the ring goes with
out saying. Why not take in the
'.ighting plant and the water plant
now? If it is not taken in now, it
never will be. I don't blame the
owners in the least for leaving the
plants out, and bull dozing the rate
payers. It is only human for men
to get all they can for nothing. But
did anyone ever think what amount
of taxes will be totally lost to the
town, providing the plants in ques
tion are not included in the incor
poration, and that they can charge
whatever rate they like and the
town will be powerless to defend it
self? And did anyone think that
not one copper can be collected
from the piece of land to the west
which is intended to be taken in
for the simple reason that there is
not a building on it? If the plants
in question are worthy plants, and
owned by responsible parties, who
are good living citizens, and will
ing to pay their way, why are they
not wanted? Don't the owners of
the plants get a splendid revenue
from the residents? And yet the
owners do not wish to pay taxes.
It is a scheme, boys, to get out of
paying taxes on a $45.000 plant.
Can't you smart business men of
this burg open your eyes, or will
you sleep forever?
If the place is to be incorporated,
let's have it done in a business like
manner, and have no stunts like
this pulled off. Why should one
man, and he the most wealthy man
in Lordsburg, go on without pay
ing taxes, while everyone else is
doing their mite to meet the legit
imate expenses of the town? Be
fore you go further, I feel it would
be to the best interests of the place
to have another petition circulated
and change the intended area to be
taken in. If not, just as sure as
the sun shines you will all be in
the soup.
December 29, 1915
r . V. Bush, Editor
Western Liberal
Dear Mr. Bush:
As one of the members of Incor
poration opposition and as a be
liever in fair play it Is my intention
in this letter to give credit where
credit is due. Since the Western
Liberal has been under your man
agement and since you have come
to Lordsburg there is no doubt but
that the town has become better,
It has received wide publicity
through your efforts and through
your live little paper we have got
ten much of what we heretofore
lacked, but Mr. Bush, don't get
over-progressive. Stand pat and
don't let the money interests in
Lordsburg rule you. Have just as
much consideration for the little
fellow the man who pays the tax
es. I have read wfth amusement the
letters by "Old Timer" published
in your paper of last week. You
published his. side of the question
now why not mine?
We know that incorporation re
ceived its incipiency and was fost
ered by the Liberal or yourself.
You believe incorporation will car
ry but had not you better Invest√≠
gate the other side more consider
ately. Lordsburg has gotten along very
nicely for many many yeara with
out being incorporated and she can
continue to grow without it. Tax
es are high enough as we all know.
Why add to the burden? Why put
this additional expense onto the
people? Let the moneyed interests
grab and hold the town with fran
chises 7 - Let the set of grafters get
in and more thoroughly adulterate
the people' money? These things
will result from incorporation.
Keep your fingers out of the fire
Let well enough alone. Put your
efforts into giving Lordsburg pub
hcity, Mr. Bush, and incorporation
will cure for itself.
'TAIS rLAY"
Incorporation
Fetitions for incorporation,
bearing the signatures of what is
believed to be a majority of the le
gal voters of Lordsburg, were filed
with the county commissioners at
Silver City this week. The com
missioners have ordered a census
taken of the town and a survey
made of the boundaries of the pro
posed incorporated village, which
according to the state laws, must
be at least one mile squire.
The census will be taken at once
and as soon as possible the survey
made. Following this the peti
tions will be checked against the
census and if a majority of the le
gal voters have signed, Lordsburg
will be declared incorporated.
In this week's issue of the Lib
eral an article written by one of
our prominent citizens, dealing
with the excluding of the forty
acres of land owned by W. H.
Small and upon which the property
of the Lordsburg Power Company
is located, is being published.
The writer of this article has the
interests of the people of Lords
burg at heart and has signed his
name to the communication. At
his request it is not published but
will be given out to any who may
inquire.
He states that a "dark horse" is
hid in not embodying the tract
in mention in the original town-
site.
The explanation is this:
According to the laws of the
state of New Mexico a village must
be incorporated at least one mile
square and in the limits only pat
ented land may be placed. In the
CENTER of the townsite to be in
corporated a monument must be
placed from which the corner lines
are run. Surrounding the 40 acre
tract east of Lordsburg in which
the Lordsburg Power Company's
plant is located on the north and
jouth, is unpatented land, which
makes it impossible to include the
land and still keep the townsite
square. For this reason the plot
had to be excluded, according to
the assistant district attorney of
Grant county. It is not a point of
personal request but of STATE
LAW.
To further strengthen their
willingness to pay city taxes the
Lordsburg Power Company has
signed the following agreement:
The Lordsburg Power Company
hereby desires and requests that
the 40 acre tract in which its plant
is located, be made an addition to
the incorporated town of Lords
burg, New Mexico.
Signed:
Lordsburg Power Company
By W. F. Ritter.
If the company did not make any
agreement the city council of
Lordsburg can make the 40 acre
tract of patented land an addition
to the town any time they see fit
without asking any person or per
sons. The question is misunderstood
by the writer of the contribution.
It is not one of taxation but LAW
OF INCORPORATION.
However, the Lordsburg Power
Company has signed a request to
oe admitted into the corporate lim
its, thus dispelling any doubt as to
the city receiving taxes from the
plant.
Hunting License Not Necessary
An opinion handed down by At
torney General Frank W. Clancy,
is to the effect that hunters of rab
bits do not need a license, nor do
trapperB of coyotes need a license
Mr. Clancy holds that the statutory
provision whereby any person
found in the field with a gun might
be construed as hunting is "inju
dicious."
The section on rabbit hunting
was rendered to Bet at rest fears of
some Indians near Las Cruces who
teared that they must have license
to conduct their winter rabbit
drives.
That relating to coyotes was ren
dered in response to an inquiry by
K. w. Edwards, an attorney of
t on umner.

ORDERS HOGS OFF STREETS
For manyi many years the name
"Lordsburg" has somehow been
connected with "hogs on the
streets." Whenever Lordsburg has
been mentioned "Have you still
got hogs on the streets?" has fol
lowed it up.
No more of this. Never again!
Lordsburg is hngless.
Assistant District Attorney C.
C. Royall has ordered the owners
of swine in this city, to pen up
their animals or be prosecuted.
The owners of the larger per cent
of hogs have already complied with
Mr. Royall's request. Let the citi
zens of Lordsburg publish this
news broadcast. No more hogs on
the Lordsburg streets.
MORENO-SALAZAR BATTLE
On the evening of January 21,

pared to meet Moreno, winner take
all.

Duncan, may be matched for one of
the preliminaries. G. S. Mullarkey

LORDSBURG GETS PUBLICITY
In the January 1st edition of the
El Paso Herald a quarter page
mining summary of New Mexico
was published, featuring the pro
gress and enormous production
of the Lordsburg region. This ar
ticle has received wide publicity
and has turned the mining spot-
lght on Lordsburg. The article
was sent out by the Western Lib
eral, being one of a series of arti
cles setting forth interesting facts
relative to Lordsburg and the
southwest. Recently a half-col
umn article on the opening of land
n the Animas was run in a large
number of widely circulated news
papers in the west, being another
one of the Liberal's efforts bo bad
ly needed.
DEATH OF. MRS. EICHWURZEL

THE ROBERTS & LEAHY
MERCANTILE CO INC.
BELIEVE BODY OF JAME3
STERLING IS FOUND
Wednesday morning a rusty gun,
a hat, some coins end a few de
composed bones were found In
Hodoo Canon near Gold Hill by
Jack Stephens, the well-known
mining man and rancher of that
place. On Tuesday a goat herder
reported to Mr. Stephens that he
had found a gun ana Mr. Stephens
went to the scene early Wednesday
morning. There among the rocks
of the canon the grewsome find was
made.
Over seven years ago, James
Sterling who for thirty-five years
had been a mining man at Gold
Hill, was found missing. A search
over all of the southwest was made,
rewards offered for the recovery of
his body and every effort made to
locate him. All was futile and the
search was given up.
The gun, rotted hat and coins
have been well identified by those
acquainted with Mr. Sterling and
there is little doubt but that the
skeleton is that of the prospector
and miner.
SCHOOL NEWS
. School opened Monday morning,
January 3, 1916 for the last half of
the school year. There were very
few enrollments of new students,
but almost the entire student body
of the fall term was present.
The 1915-16 term will be the
most prosperous year the Lords
burg schools have experienced.
The enrollment is larger, the corps
of teachers efficient, the students
eager to learn. Literary exercises
have been introduced and that is a
task in itself. Drawing, physical
culture, sewing and handwork are
in working order. If no more im
provements are made during the
rest of the year, the progress dur
ing the fall term would easily give
a large margin of benefits to the
scholars and the town. If "prepar
edness" is to be the nation's mot
to from now on, we must start with
our boys and girls, our future citi
zens. Remember this when we ask
for your cooperation and your sup
port, you need us as we need you.
Unless San Simon "backs out,"
or weather interferes, there will be
a real battle waged on the school
grounds Saturday afternon at two
o'clock, which will make the most
famous battles of history appear
mere child's play. Think! Arizona
has seized from us a few points,
would any Lordsburg or New Mex
ico team suffer that? We must,
wp wi!', yrcttrzr. back. Come and
u? i - i. k band, hun
dreds of roe-' -rs Give us your
earnest support, te&ks us believe
you really want us to win.
Having once been beaten the
girls who are out for basketball,
are down to work with more zeal
and earnestness than they ever
have shown before. Our team is
taken from the sirth to the eleventh
-rade, almost all the teams that
have and desire to be, matched
with us, are high school teams. Our
girls, with but few exceptions are
novices, other teams have had
years of practice. But notwith
standing, we mean to win, and gain
a reputation for our school of fast
and clean athletics.
Should the school yard become
too crowded for the Lordsburg
rooters on Saturday, ladders will
be erected to the adjacent roof to
provide room for the spectators.
Don't stay away to give us space.
