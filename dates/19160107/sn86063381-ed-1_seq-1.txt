CUPID'S "DUM-DUMS" FAIL
TO TOUCH CITY'S LEADERS
All Sorts and Description Old Men
Men Who Have Never Worked
and Never Will Have To.
A report from our special Leap
Year staff correspondent shows that
there are more than fifty eligible
bachelors in Bemidji. What a
"slaughter" there will be.
Homes for All.
Think of it, girls A half hun
dred unattached male human beings
and not one of them who couldn't
maintain a home nice enough for
anyone.
Fifty unwifed spenders, who give
all their time to their business, their
clubs and their fellowmen. The sel
fish things.
Suits All Tastes.
For the Bemidji girls who would
take advantage of the season's priv
ileges the list of famous Bemidji
bachelors includes "something to
suit every taste," as they say at the
stores. Many of the best known
men in the country, we might even
say, state without stretching it very
much, are running around this city
"heart-whole and fancy-free."
Some County Officials.
Some of the leading county offi
cials are still untouched by Cupid's
"dum-dums With them are a
number of other popular men va
rious walks of life A banker or
two are still loose and a large num
ber of business and professional men
might be had for the asking. Then
there are doctors and lawyers, den
tists and merchants and bakers, "old
men" about town, men who never
worked and never will have to Oh,
girls, there is surely something in
the list to suit you.
Girls Have Right.
If you are a skeptic we submit a
list, not complete, we admit, for that
would be nearly impossible, but some
of the well known and favorite sons.

SCOOP
THE CUB
RBPOFTER
CITY OF BEMIDJI
TO HAVE PAY-UP
WEEK FEB. 21-26
Movement to Induce People to Fay
Their Debts Has Been Inaugur
ated by Merchants.
BANKS TO LOAN MONEY
TO BALANCE ACCOUNTS
Event is Timely Few People Who
Do Not Owe Few People Who
Could Not Pay.
Bemidji is to have a Pay-Up Week
during the week of Feb. 21 to 26.
This was decided at a meeting of
the Bemidji Merchants' association
at the Commercial club rooms late
yesterday afternoon. All business
men, professional men and individ
uals will be invited to participate in
this campaign.
The Northern National bank, the
First National bank and the Security
State bank will unite in an agree
ment to make "Pay-Up Week" loans.
Money will be loaned to any reliable
person so that all past debts can be
cleaned up. Where endorsers are
believed necessary, the merchant, it
is believed, will endorse the note.
President E. A. Barker of the as
sociation appointed W. L. Brooks,
H. C. Baer and R. L. Schumaker to
act as a committee to prepare the
banks' side of the Pay-Up Week
campaign.
It is believed Bemidji is the first
city in the country where the banks
have taken an active interest in this
manner.
The following committee was ap
pointed to plan the campaign for the
merchants: E. H. Denu, F. A. Wil
son and C. W. Jewett. It is planned
to secure stickers, labels, pennants,
handbills, posters, etc., to call at
tention to the week.
Pay-Up Week is a timely event in
this city as there are few people who
do not owe debts to someone. It is
believed that there are but few who
would not pay up if they could.
Here is how the nation-wide Pay
Up Week started:
Lewis W. Moore, editor of the
Border Telephone of Hume, Bates
county, Mo., has the habit of regul
arly doing unusual things of a pro
gressive nature. As a result of his
persistent, untiring advocacy, prac
tically every building in Hume is
painted white, and traveling men
from everywhere have christened it
the White City and retold its glories
throughout the country.
The result of his Pay-Up Week
campaign was so highly satisfactory
to all of the people in Hume that
it became speedily noised about, and
Editor Moore received so many in
quiries from metropolitan newspa
pers, manufacturers, wholesalers, job
bers and retailers throughout the
United States that he assumed the
responsibility of proclaiming a na
tional Pay-Up Week.
Editor Moore states that the busi
ness men of Hume were agreeably
surprised over the almost complete
settlement of all accounts due them,
and these citizens were more pleased
over the ease with which the feat
was accomplished and the great sat
isfaction resulting from being able
to know and say that all of their
debts were paid.
Miss Jennie Gratton entertained a
small number of her friends at a
theater party Wednesday evening.
After going to the Grand theater,
light refreshments were served at the
Gratton residence, 1114 Beltrami av
enue.
Mrs. Alden Remfrey and daughter,
Madalene, left Tuesday night for
New Ulm, Minn., where they will
make their home. Mr. Remfrey re
cently accepted a position in one of
the theaters there and resigned his
leadership of the Cass Lake band.
Eleven lady friends surprised Mrs.
W. H. Elletson yesterday afternoon
at her home on Beltrami avenue, it
being her birthday.
