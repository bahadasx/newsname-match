SUBMARINE ISSUE
AIRED IN SENATE
Gore Would Keep
Belligerent Ships
Two Bills Introduced In Senate To
isti
Washington, Jan. 6. President Wil-1
ton's effort to keep the submarine is
buo out of the debates la congress
tor the present has failed.
Tho sennte plunged into a discus
sion or this subject with an abandon
that surprised tho morv conservative
members and that finally led Senator
Stone, chairman of tho foreign rela
tions committee, to cut off the debate
with i cail for an executive session.
Tiro debate In tho senate disclosed
A surprisingly strong sentiment in
favor of legislation curtailing tli
rights of American citizens to travel
tho high seas on belligerent vessels,
or on ve&sols of any other character
which carry munitions of war. The
disclosure of this sentiment "was the
irost Important development in the
submarine situation, and is likely to
be reflcct-d in the administration's
handling of tho case of thi Persia,
which was sunk with United States
Consul McNeely on board.
Tho president and Secretary Lan
sing are still marking time on this
case. They have not yot obtained In
formation establishing tho fact that
d submarine sank tho Persia, and un
til this anil the nationality of the un
Oersea bcrt arc determined tholr
tands wi'.l be tied.
Tho sentiment in tho senate against
American citizens endangering the
reuce of ihe country by traveling on
belligerent merchant ships was fur
ther emphasized by two bills intro
duced by Senator Gore of Oklahoma,
one' of the Democratic leaders who
has been usually a strong administra
tion supporter. One of these hills
frovents tr.e issuance of passports to
any American citizen excopt upon his
making r.n affidavit that ho would not
travel, on a belligerent ship.
Tho second bill prevents belligerent
ohips from entering or clearing ports
of the United States if they transport
American citizens as passongers.
This bill would also withhold protec
tion from any Amorican who traveled
tho nigh seas without a passport ob
tained in conformity with tho legisla
tion proposed.
Essence of Debate.
During debate In the senate Sena
tor Works (Hep., Wash) said that the
American government should have
warned Its citizens from sailing on
belligerent ships. He held tho gov
ernment morally responsible for
rcaths of Americans who sailed on
the Lusltanla and other ships.
Senator Reed of Missouri combat
ted Senator Works' suggestion that

Accoul
Americans Off All
This End
because the United States permitted
tho export of arms to Great Britain
tho government violated neutrality.
Senator Lodge (Rep., Mass.) held
that to interpose an embargo on ex
portation of arms at (his time would
be an unneutral act.
"Suppose a belligerent," suggested
Fenator O'Gorman, "the chlof benefi
ciary of our present policy of exports,
were to disregard our rights a8 a neu
tral, does tho senator think we would
bo justified in a retaliatory embargo?'"
"Of course," said Mr. Lodge, "wo
would have the right to impose a re
talltory embargo."
Senators O'Gorman of New York
and Hitchcock of Nebraska, both
Democrats, urged the advisability , of
an embargo on munitions. Senatoi
O'Gorman also informed tho senate
that American Consul R. N. Neely,
who lost his life on the British liner
Persia, had disregarded the advice of
American Consul General Skinner at
London that he make tho journey to
Aden on a Dutch vessel,
WESTERNERS DWINDLED
Several Arrests Made by the New
York Police.
New York, Jan. C. Four arrests,
three of them in New York city, and
tho holding of one of the men in ?50,
000 bail, led to the announcement that
the police and the district attorney's
olllce have uncovered an Important
bnnd of swindlers, who have taken
thousands of dollars from tho unwary
of the country on a variation of the
old "up against It" faro game. The
victims, persuaded that they were
either to have the aid of abank deal
er or an infallible system, found
themselves swindled. Frank T.
Thompson, said by the police to have
been known under other names,
among them W. I. Cherry, is the man
held in $50,000 bail. With him was
tho man giving his name as Joseph
C. Fcldman, a manufacturer. Louis
Wise, who calls himself a lithograph
er, was taken In custody nbouc the
seme time. George Phelman was re
ported under arrest from St. Louis.
Tho specific charge against Thomp
son and Fcldman is the larceny of
$1C,300 from two western men, Hen
ry Gallert of St. Louis, who gave up
?5.000 In 1913, and ?8,000 in 1914, and
Arthur Levy of Chicago, who con
tributed WOO In 1913.

HELD BLAMELESS
Gongresstonalfteport Denounces
Roosevelt Charges.
Washington, Jan. C Charges circu
lated during tho last session of con
gress that adminlfatration officials act
ed in the Interest of foreign u:ifI.rcr,s
firms in urging the passage of the
government ship purchase bill were
held to be baseless In majority and
minority reports liled by the senate
committee appointed to Investigate
them. Both reports also found the
shipping interests blameless of Ule
gal activity In opposition ,to the meas
ure. Tho majority denounced Theodore
Roosevelt for falling to appear before
tho committee to testify concerning
his published assertion that President
Wilson and Secretary Bran "luul en
deavored In the Interest of certain
foreign business firms to secure for
the United States the power to pur
chase the interned ships of ono of tho
belligerents." '
"The writer, added tho report,
'whoso eminence was naturally cal
culated to give weight to his utter
anco, finding himself without babis,
even of a hearsay character, for his
s'anderous attack upon tho highest
officer of his government, simply re
ported to a palpable, sophistry to es
cape tho responsibility for tho 'asser
tion he had made."
While the committee found no evi
dence to Indicate that the president
or Secretary Bryan harbored any pur
pose to buy interned ships, the ma
jority held that it was not'dlfncult to
conceive of reasons consistent with
ttin most exalted motives that might
irduce the president to refrain from
a nubile de.laration that belligerent
ships would not be bought.
With reference to criticism of Col
onel Roosevelt, the minority said, "we
find ourselves unable to agree with
tho strictures with reference 'to ex
President Roosevelt."

through the Teuton lines northeast of
Czernowitz and terrible losses to tho
Moseovites in these attacks, as well
as on other parts of the new battle
line in eastern Uallcla, are reported

bodies were counted, and of several
Russian battalions, each numbering

COMPULSION BILL
LIKELY TO PASS
Affects During Period of War
Only One Glass cf Men,
MEASURE EXCLUDES IRELAND
Neither Compulilonlst Nor Volun
tarlsts Satisfied With the Provisions
of the British Government's Mili
tary Service Bill Lord Derby's Re
port Sharply Attacked by a Retiring
Member of the Cabinet.
London, Jan. 6. Although tho pas
sage of the new military service bill,
launched in the houso of commons by
Premier Asquith, la almost assured,
It is certain that the bill will satisfy
neither tho compulsionlsta, who be
lieve it Insufficient, nor the rolun
tarlsts, who uphold the British birth
right of freedom and oppose every
form of compulsion.
In his speech introducing the meas
ure, the premier was frequently
cheered as he referred to the figures I
of Lord Derby's recruiting campaign,
Which ho described as "wonderful."
The first disturbance came at the pre
mier's reference to "the limited area
In which the new measure will be ef
fective," meaning tiat Ireland would
be excluded from the bill. The real
outcry, however, came when the pre
mier declared that among the exemp
tions would be men with "conscien
tious objections to undertaking com
batant service."
Tho members were amazed. The
premier explaino" .that many men
might be quite willing to serve -their
country, "men who are excellent pa
triots, but who object on conscien
tious grounds to the taking of life."
Loud protests interrupted tho reading
of the bill, the interruptions-lasting
eoveral minutes. The premier spoke
for fifty-five minutes.
Attacks Derby Report.
The opposition was led by Sir .To".in
Simon, who has Just resigned from
tho cabinet as home secretary. He
delivered a scathing arraignment o!
Lord Derby's report. His entire op
P'osition was directed not against the
government measure, but against thp
Derby report, the figures, of which he
denounced as entirely erroneous and
misleading. Ho said ho was willing to
support compulsion If needed to win
tho war, but that he was determined
to oppose It if not warranted by facts.
He begged the house to await more
accurate data than were contained in
the Derby report before taking ac
tion. Earl Kitchener, secretary of state
for war, defended the compuldlc.i bill.
Ho said: "I do not consider that the
proposed change should be regardeu
In the light of a deterioration In the
principle of voluntary service. In
this country it only affects during the
jerlod of the war one class of men,
'among whom are undoubtedly a cer
tain number who have so poor an idea
of their duties as citizens as to re
quire some persuasion greater than
appeal to bring them to the colon-"
Under the terms of the service bill
all males between the ages of eigh
teen and forty-one, who are bachelors
or widowers without children depend
ent on them, are liable for military
service. Ireland is excluded from the
terms of the meusurp.
John Redmond announced that the
Irlph party, of which ho Is the leader,
could not support the compulsion bill.
Iho Irish leader declared that the bill
wdb unnecessary for winning the war.
Ho ndded that If the Irish party was
convinced that the passage of the bill
was necessary to end the war, Us at
titude would be entirely different.
