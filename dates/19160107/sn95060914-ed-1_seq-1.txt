OUR METAL OUTPUT
Arizonas Production Is 90-
000000 for the Year
1915
The phenomenal record of pro
duction for Arizona was reached in
1915 by gold silver copper lead
and zinc amounting to almost 90
000000 jumping in one year from
60000000 Yet Arizona has but
started according to a bulletin re
ceived from the Arizona State Bu
reau of Mines
During 1915 the Old Dominion
mine was curtailed in its production
for almost two months by a flood
the Clifton mines were shut down
for four months because of labor
troubles the plant of the Interna
tional Smelting Refining Company
has but started the smelter of the
United Verde was but recentlj
blown in and is not yet worked to
capacity the New Cornelia with its
4000 tons per day production has
not yet started and the Ajo Con
solidated doing equal work has
yet to come
Copper in 1916 will with all of
the above properties working reach
almost 600000000 pounds With
this increase the gold and silver
production will follow as many of
the mines have gold and silver con
tent Then the Oatman district has
just had its start although the
States production in zinc was two
and one half millions the zinc pro
duction is in its infancy
Arizona is coming forward with
leaps and bounds in its production
of tungsten molybdenum vanadium
and many of the so called rare
metals The year 1916 should
see 90000000 valuation on the
metal output raised to 125000000

PROSPECTS BRIGHT
Business Conditions Have Im
proved Over this Time
a Year Ago
Bright prospects for business
throughout the country in striking
contrast with conditions at this time
a year ago are pictured in statistics
and standards committee report
made public January 2d by the
Chamber of Commerce of the United
States
There are localities where much
caution and conservatism yet re
main says the report and the in
fluence of high prices for the future
further accentuates this caution be
cause dealers feel that high prices
will curtail buying by the consumers
Broadly speaking it may be said
that the spirit of optimism and
hopefulness prevails to a degree
that has not been apparent for nearly
a decade and the general belief and
expectation is for such prosperity
during 1916 as will recompense the
people of this country for all their
past misfortunes
The adverse effect of this con
flict in Europe still prevails in some
sections though to very much less
extent than at this time last year
There are still scattered fears of
the possibility of this country being
involved in the gigantic strife but
against this is the large portion of
the people who are paying less and
less attention to the war and more
and more concentrating their
thoughts and efforts on domestic
matters Beyond this is the strik
ing fact that the influence of the
war at present as a whole is more
favorable than adverse because of
the tremendous impetus it has given
certain lines of manufacturing es
pecially east of the Allegheny ana
likewise to many agricultural pro
ducts
This influence is a material factor
in the present high prices of sheep
cattle wool grain and products of
leather steel iron copper brass
lead and zinc or spelter Much of
the prosperity in the grain raising
sections is due to the fact that the
farmer is selling freely because oi
remunerative figures for his pro
ducts and there seems to be no man
ner of doubt but that these prices
will decline materially in case oi
peace
While there are many conjectures
as to the consequent effect upon
business of such a contingency the
general belief centers around the
conviction that the war will last for
some time and that the part of wis
dom is to make the most of the pre
sent situation regrettable as it is
and not taking undue thought ol
the morrow by attempting to fore
cast the likelihood of what will hap
pen if peace is declared
Railroads report better business
as a whole and railroad shops are
employing more and more men
Manufacturing has taken on new
life through the whole country ana
in almost every branch There h
much consequent decrease in un
employment Prices are being ad
vanced everywhere by manufac
turers in all lines and they are con
tinually being flooded with orders
A Splendid New
Years Present
Through the bishops of the sev
eral wards of the St Joseph Stake
F L Ginter manager of the Gila
Valley Milling Company presented
to the worthy poor of those settle
ments including also the worthy
poor not of the Mormon faith seventy-eight
sacks of Belle flour
which were delivered in time for a
New Years gift
Through fhe columns of The
Guakuian the beneficiaries and the
bishops also President Kimball de
sires to express their sincere thanks
and appreciation for the kindness
and consideration of Mr Ginter and
the Gila Valley Milling Company
Belle flour is gaining prominence
and giving good satisfaction every
where By patronizing our home
products we make a market for
our produce and all are alike
benefitted

SEVEN STAIES GO
DRY NEWYEARS DAY
More Than 3000 Saloon-
besides Breweries Are J
Put Out of Business
NINETEEN STATES BAR RUM
Colorado Iowa Oregon Wash
ington Idaho Arkansas and
South Carolina Are Dry
Statewide prohibition of the sale
and manufacture of intoxicating
liquors became effective in seven
states at midnight December 31st
According to figures offered by
the Anti saloon League of America
the addition of the seven states that
went dry January 1 1916 will
bring the total of prohibition states
in the Union to nineteen
More than 3000 saloons a large
number of breweries wholesale
liquor houses and distilleries were
put out of business
The states which entered the dry
column were Iowa Colorado Ore
gon Washington Idaho Arkansas
and South Carolino Many counties
in all of the seven states have pro
hibited the sale of liquor for a num
ber of years under local option laws
According to one authority be
tween 2000000 and 3000000 was
expended for liquor in Colorado
during the last few weeks of De
cember
The Arkansas department of the
Anti saloon League announced that
the league would have workers in
the field to see that the law was en
forced
In Iowa bargain sales in the
502 saloons of the state were in pro
gress all day December 31st prep
aratory to the final closing at mid
night Under the mulct law repeal
passed by the last legislature statu
tory prohibition is restored pending
the action of the next legislature
and the people on the proposed con
stitutional amendment for prohibi
tion which is to be dispqsed of with
in the next two years
Colorado at midnight December
31st swung into the dry column
and early in the night thousands
paraded the streets of Denver in a
carnival of merrymaking while pro
grams of fashionable clubs and other
societies were framed to celebrate
until midnight the passing of John
Barleycorn and the old year
The throngs that crowded the
streets like the saloonkeepers ap
parently took the advent of prohi
bition in a philosophical way
Last drop gone Were through
read a sign in a prominent dispen
sary The Supreme Court got our
tjoat read another
New Years eve revellers began
early to make the most of their final
opportunity to buy liquor in the
restaurants and saloons of Portland
Oregon in anticipation of the pro
hibition which became effective at
midnight Grills were crowded as
early as 600 oclock and hilarity
reigned Some saloons ran entirely
out of stock during the day and
closed their doors Others which
had only one or two barrels of
liquor kept open and served it out
indiscriminately to all citizens re
gardless of what drink was ordered
Seattle Wash which under the
new prohibition law will be one of
the largest dry cities in the world
outside of Russia welcomed the new
year and bade farewell to alcoholic
liquor with much noise and merri
ment
All saloons did a large business
There was no lack of beer anywhere
but improvident saloon keepers who
had sold all their whiskey and other
spirituous drinks were unable to re
plenish their stocks at the wholesale
houses and the variety of beverages
in some saloons were limited It
svas estimated that in the fifteen
days ending at noon Fridaya million
dollars had been spent in Seattle for
liquor wrapped in packages to be
carried home for use in the dry
period
An absence of disorders marked
the closing of Iowas saloons De
cember 31st The finish despite the
rush was quite orderly and arrests
in all wet cities were little above
the normal
The supply of many of the sa
loons had run out long before the
closing time
In Sioux City crepe was hung on
many of the saloon doors
