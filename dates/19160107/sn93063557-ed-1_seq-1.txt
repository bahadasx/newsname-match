INVENTORY TIME MEANS
PROFITS SACRIFICED
Inventory timc is with us again as is also the time to make
room for new spring furniture. It is our custom at this time to sac
rifice profits in order to( move the goods on hand save the work
of inventory and give our customers the benefit.
We have some splendid bargains in Parlor, Library, Dining
Room, Den and Chamber Furniture which we feel confident some
one needs and to those in need we say COME NOW, for there has
never been a time when you could buy such high grade furniture
in mahogany, golden or fumed oak, birdseye maple, etc, as we are
now offering at prices on which all thought of profit to ourselves has
been abandoned.
