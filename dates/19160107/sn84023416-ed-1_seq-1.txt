Jack-the-Hugger" Arrested.
The ladies and girls of Island Pond
will be glad to iearn they can once
more travel our streets with safety,
now that G. C. Survell, otherwise
known as "Jack-the-Hugger," has
been captured and .sentenced to no
less than six months or more than
eight in jail. There is little -doubt
but Sirvell, who is known by half a
dozen a'iaes, is the same "hugger"
that operated in Franklin county
and several other places last fall. He
came here about ten days ago and
accosted several ladies on the street
in the early evening of Thursday,
Dee. 30. About eight o'clock he
wandered down Railroad street and
seeing several boys and girls skating
on the creek, asked if one of the lit
tle girls would deliver a message
down at the iron bridge for him. A
little Chesney girl offered to carry
the message, stating that on her
way she thought it funny that Sur
vell should go along w'th her. Be
coming frightened she turned and
ran from him. Survell chased her
some distance, being unable to over
take her. Previous to this he had
grabbed and hugged several other
little girls and offered them money
to accompany him to the iron bridge.
The authorities were notified and
Survell was taken the next day. At
his hearing before Judge Lund h
claimed to he under the influence of
drink. He also claimed his home
was in Gilmaii, 111., some 80 miles
from Chicago, but by some of his
answers to State's Attorney Powell's
questions it is most certain he never
saw Illinois.

The Town Clock.
For many years the need of a pub
lic clock has been discussed and some
efforts have been made to solicit a
fund for this purpose, but an invest
igation of the expense had caused
the matter to be postponed till this
summer, when the Ladies' Circle of
the G. A. R. offered a subscription
of $284.24, if the balance could be
raised to buy and install a suitable
clock. The first plan was to pur
chase a clock with a steel bell at the
cost of $450.00 but the citizens ani
former residents responded so liber
ally to the project, that a larger
clock was selected and by good for
tune a metal bell cast in 1862 was
located which could be purchased fer
about one-half the value at which
bells of a similar weight were quoted.
By the untiring efforts of Mrs.
Vinnie Dickson, Mrs. Ellen Bessette
and some assistance from other?, a
fund to cover a total cost of $871.12
was collected. This covers the price
of the clo;k, bell and "nstallation of
same. There will be a small sum
needed for the care of the clock, so
that any who have not paid their sub
scriptions, or those who have not had
an opportunity to subscribe and care
to do so now can contribute to such
a fund.
A list of paid subscriptions is giv
en herewith and receipted vouchers
for the paid bills as shown are open
lo public inspection. Thrcommittee
wish to thank all who have given to
ward this public benefit for their in
teret in this successful attempt to
bring our village up to modern standards.
