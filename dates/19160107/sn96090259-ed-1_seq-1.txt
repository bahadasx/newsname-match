MASKED BALL
Enjovable Eveipng Spent at Evans Last Fri

Perhaps ode of the most enjoyable
events of the'year was the masked ball
at the Evans Hotel on last Friday even
ing when about sixty- oouple donned
costumes of various wierd and clown
ish appearanoe and spent the early
part of the evening in these disguises
dancing for fhe amusement of their
friends as well as themselves. Nearly
every character known was represented
from tbe Jtw peddler to the lady of tbe
ancient periods. At ten-thirty the
masks were removed revealing in many
instances an entirely different person
than the one whom you were oertain
had been cavorting about on tbe dano
ing floor.
or tbe suocetB of thlB event credit
is due to tbe management of the hotel
and to Mrs. E. S. Ames and Mrs. Nel
son Northop. It was a fitting climax
to the old year festivities and a lyful
greeting for 1910.

URGES FURTHER
DEVELOPMENT
SECRETARY OF INTERIOR IS
SUES ANNUAL REPORT
WANTS MORE IRRIGATION
ADVOCATES FURTHER DEVELOPMENT
OF IRRIGATION PROJECTS AND
WATER CONTROL
(By Chas. A. Nystrom, Secretary
Angostora Irrigation Association.)
The annual report of the Secretary
of the Interior, whioh has just been
issued, is full of suggestions of interest
to us in this western territory. Frank
lin K. Lane, the Secretary, is himself a
western man, and understands west
ern problems. In him we have a
staunch friend and supporter, in our
effortB to devtlope the vast resources
of the west and middle-west. He has
studied irrigation, uiiuing, and forestry
at first hand, and is in position to
speak advisedly.
This report oovers tbe fiscal jrear
ending June 30,1915, and is directed to
tbe President. Bis policies are so
olearly set fourth in olear-out English,
a style so direct and forceful, that we
oopy some of bis leading^ statements
word for word as follows:
Washington, November 20, 1915,
Sir: In presenting an outline of the
years work, I make bold to express the
hope that no other polioies of the gov
ernment may be allowed to stay tbe
internal development of this oountry.
There is a fear, how general I do not
know, that this government will bait
in carrying out. its full and needed
program of legislation affecting home
affairs because of the immediate need
for strengthening our national defens
es. This apprehenson arises, 1 am con
fident, out of no lack of sympathy with
the plan to increase tbe army and tbe
navy, but out of a feeling that tbe gov
eminent in both executive and legis
lative branches will be so immersed in
matters military and naval as to over
look these matters of less dramatio
and perhaps less immediate oonoern.
Any suoh course, 1 am sure, would of
fend the most deep seated instinct in
onr people."
In this plea, he voioes the apprehen
sion of our people in the southern
Blaoh Hills. We liave every reason to
believe that had not tbe European war
oome in to engross the attention of our
Congress in dealing with the problems
growing out of this war, our big Ango
stura irrigation project in Custer and
Fall River counties would now be un
der construction. And we very much
fear further delay for the reaspns sug
gested by the seoretary.
Mr. Lane further states: "The waters
that flow idly to tbe sea oould be made
to support not leas than 50,000,000 peo
ple if turned upon the land that other
wise will remain pasturelaud or other
wise altogether worthless Tbe demon
stration haa been given that the lands
of little rain oan be made more fruitful
than those where the rainfall is abun
dant. Land and water we have tbe
problem of bringing tbem together is
one only of money."
The seoretary also makes a pita for
tbe passage of tbe two bills advocated
by him last year, which both passed
tbe bouse but were killed in the senate.
Theae bills were the water-power bill
governing the use of public lauds for
hydro-eleotrio development, and tbe
general development bill, providing for
practicable methods of disposing of our
oil, gas, coal, phosphate, and pota
without danger of monopoly or non
use. Tbe royalty from oil, gas, coal,
and water power developed on publio
lands should be used for the reclaim
ing of the arid oountry and when need
ed no longer for this purpose, tbeu to
ba divided with the states, aooording to
Mr. Lanes suggestions. Tbis would
add materially tc tbe one hundred mil
lion dollar reclamation fund now lied
up in tbe big federal irrigation pro
jects, thus permitting a number of
new ones to be started pending tbe re
payment of funds already invested by
the reclamation service. It is confi
dently believed that tbte same bill will
oome up for passage at tbis session of
oongress, and that with som) amend
ments it will pass.
A plea for the oontrol of tbe great
river systems of tbe oountry ia alao
made: He believes they should be put
to praotioal use—just what we in South
Dakota, have been advocating, and
UA
0-" I" ,/
«k
Vol. 30 No. 38
what we hope soon to do with the tur
bulent Cheyenne. As the secretary so
effectively puts it—"We need to oatoh
that water when it is young, soon af
ter it has been born from the snows.
There, in mountain valleys, it should
be kept for a time, and as needed, led
into the peaceful paths of usefulness.
And on that problem the reclamation
servloe is working."
The seoretary further states that
this water oontrol for irrigation pur
poses, and for saving the lowlands
from floods in the lower districts, is of
such magnitude that the government
must undertake the work, the sooner
the better. The government should
advanoe its credit to the undertaking,
and should go further, and use direotly
some of its own funds. He says that a
commission to devise ways and means
by whioh the states, private land
owners, and the federal government
oan 00 operate In paying for this work,
is of greater need than a report upon
engineering methods.
This report is replete with inform
ation concerning our western problems.
A oopy jpay be seoured from the
Seorttary of the Interior or from our
congressman.
NOTED EVANGELIST HERE
Rev. W. L. Head, of Atlanta, Georgia, at
Baptist Church
Rev. Wilburn L. Head, the evan
gelist, is here. The baptists were cer
tainly fortunate in their selection of a
man. Rev. Head has made a great hit
already with tbe people of Hot Springs.
He is simply great. He is a/ powerful
preacher. He is an old time evangelist.
Enthusiasm runs high. The people
like bim. tie is both humorous and
serious. He makes you laugh and ory.
He makes you think and pray. Seldom
is it possible for a oity the size of Hot
Springs to have so strong an evangelist
as is Mr. Head, and those who are
failing to hear him are missing a rare
treat.
He speaks every night of the week
but Saturday. All the meetings are
being held in the First Baptist ohuroh
on College Hill. Sunday morning be
will preach at ll 00 o^olook. Sunday
afternoon at 2:30 there will be -a -great
mass-meeting for everybody. This is
a little unusual as most evangelists in
clude only men for the Sunday after
noon meetings, but Rev. Head takes in
everybody, and the queation is, will
tbe Baptist oburob hold tbe people. r,i£
His sermons for next week are: Sun
day night, January 9, "A Fast Young
Man." Monday night, Jauuary 10,
"Our Women." Tuesday night, Janu
ary 11, "A Man's Darling Sin. "Wednes.
day night, January 12, "A Man's Back
bone," Thursday night, January 13,
Man's New Heart."
If you Bing, Dr. Eaton wants you to
join tho Chorus Choir. If you play,
bring along your oornet, violin, man-:
dolin, or other instrument and help
along with the musio. The children
will sing on Monday, Wednesday and

Fridey evenings. Everybody iB welcome
and everyone should bear Rev. Head
while he is here. You have paid fifty
cents to bear many a lecturer who was"
not half so good. Hear Rev. Head onoe
atd you will want to hear bim many
times. AU of ths meetings are of
oourae being held iu the Baptist
oburoh.
A lot of people are anxious to know
what suoh a meeting will cost. Rev.
Head has oome to Hot Springs without
any guarantee whataoever. The aotual
expeuees of tbe meeting, suoh as oar
fare, hotel bills, etc. are paid oy tak-i
i^g offerings from time to time during
tbe oonrae of the meetings, and a free
will offering will be taken especially
for Rev Mr. Head. Mr. Head doee not
have the ddliar work upon htm any
where.
