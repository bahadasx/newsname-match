The business men of Caldwell are
taking advantage of the privileges of
fered bv the high school gymnasium,
and have organized classes which will
meet each Tuesday and Thursday
evening. This is a very worthy move
ment, and the school authorities
welcome the people of Caldwell to use
the school buildings and equipment
for any purpose which is for the Rood
of the community. So far, however
movements in this direction have been
without unification, and the result has
been that only a few, in small segre
gated groups have received the bene
fits.
Get-Together Movement.
There should be a "get-together
movement" on the part of the busi
ness men, the churches and the
schools, and Recreation Organizations
perfected, so that wholesome and
lasting results may be obtained. It
has been suggested that, instead of a
small fund from each being put into
use here and there over the citv for
recreation purposes, these funds be
combined into one larger one, which
will be of greater service to the young
folks of the entire community.

places of amusement provided where
young men and boys may spend their
spare time, and obtain the associa
tions and pleasures that they now find
in questionable places. Game rooms
and reading rooms under the super
Ik— vision of someone who understands
young people should be furnished,
and the opportunjty presented for tïie
pursuit of vocational work such as
manual training, domestic science,
etc. Young people find the work
which they do with their hands In
tensely interesting, and willingly
work overtime at such tasks.
Manual Training Department Open
During Entire Vacation.
That our boys and young men
would make use of such opportun!
ties is evinced by the fact that the
high school manual training shops
were open and running full force dur
ing the two weeks of holiday vaca
tion and that they are busy each day
until about six o'clock, on regular
school days, while extra work in that
department of the school is not com
pulsory. Arrangements undoubtedly
could be made whereby this depart
ment could be placed at the disposal
of the young men of the. community
whether they are in school or not at
a very low cost, while a similar ar
rangement might be made with the
sewing and cooking departments of
the public schools.
Gymnasium Program Big Success.
By having the cooperation of the
ladies' clubs of the city, health giv
ing exercises should be provided for
women of all stations in life. These
exercises may be of a purelv sesth
etic nature and yet be very beneficial
The work that was demonstrated bv
the girls' gymnasium classes, on the
evening before Christmas vacation
commenced, was a striking example
of what may be accomplished along
this line. There were folk dances
drills, calesthentics and other exer
cises which at the same time have
large health factor. This program
under the direction of Miss Huit and
Miss Scott was well attended and was
a pronounced success.
School Enrollments Increasing
The problem of supervising the
childrens' plav hour becomes more
difficult with the rapid growth in the
school enrollment. There has been
reported a genera! increase in the en
rollment all over the clDv since Dtie
schools opened January i. The na
"irai influx that occurs at opening of
the new semester will tax the schools
to their capacity.

members of Dhe high school societv

OtRLETCORN »II IN

OF JDNUIOT
NEXT STEP IS VOTE ON PRO
POSED AMENDMENT TO
STATE CONSTITUTION
AT ELECTION.
Republicans Are Hopeful of Outcome
of Next Election—Alexander Has
Started His Advertising Stunts Al
ready—Tells Why He Failed to
Deliver the Goods.
(Special to Caldwell Tribune.)
Boise, Jan. 5.—The new year gives
promise of events of great public in
terest to Idaho. To begin with the
very first day ushered In state-wide
prohibition of the liquor traffic, and
before the year ends the people will
vote upon the question in the form
of a constitutional amendment pro
posing to forever banish John Barley
corn from the state. The amendment
will carry with but little oposition.
About the only question to be solved
is as to the validity of that portion
of the act which provides that it is a
crime to have a limited amount of
liquor in possession for private or
family use. This question the courts
will decide and even if that provision
of the prohibitory law is declared un
constitutional, it will not invalidate
its other provisions.
Prohibition will hardly cease to be
a matter of keen comment until we
shall have an exciting political cam
paign upon us. In fact it is already
here and from now on there will be
much activity in "mobilization" of
political forces and "calling to the
colors" by political captains. Gover
nor Alexander was early in the game..
In fact on the first day following New
Year he had a half-page advertise
ment in his Boise organ, intended to
brace up his political fortunes.
Idaho will elect an entire set ol
state, county and precinct officers this
year, from Governor down to Coroner.
The only exceptions are the district
judges and the county auditors. The
are selected for a term of four vears
and hold over this year. Of course but
one of the supreme judges is to be
chosen, a successor to Chief Justice
Sullivan. Two congressmen are to
be elected, but no United States sena
tor. The presidential election will
increase political interest. While the
primaries are yet a long ways off, the
aspirants for political honors are al
ready laying the foundations for their
campaigns, and some of them have
been busy for some time.
On the Democratic side there has
been but one candidate mentioned for
any important office and that is Gov
ernor Moses Alexander to succeed
himself. The governor has everything
his own way in the Democratic party.
The Democrats used to figure that
they had several leaders but it is con
ceded that they have but one now.
The Progressives arc pursuing a
policy adopted by Woodrow Wilson
in Mexico, "watchful waiting." The
Progressive party is dead so far as
hope of ever becoming predominant
is concerned and most of them have
given up the^ cause and returned to
their former political affiliations.
There are still enough of them left lh
Idaho, however, to do some political
business.
It is presumed that if a reasonably
satisfactory national and state ticke\
is nominated by the Republican party
the Progressives who arc still holding
out will return to the fold, hence
their policy of "watchful waiting."
The Progressives will command con
sideration.
In the Republican party there is n
great deal of optimism, as is evidenc
ed by the number of candidates an
xious for places upon the Republican
ticket, especially to head the ticket.
This would not be the case if it were
matter of leading a forlorn hope.
The failure of Governor Alexander to
afford any material relief to ihe tax
payers has taken all the wind out of
the governor's sails. He tut and
slashed appropriation all right, some
of which were more or less meritor
ious, but he failed utterly to grasp the
tax problem, and the taxpayers ar«
paying the same old rates in most
parts of the state, and in some instan
ces their tax bills are much higher.
He promised the impossible, he has
not made good, and now comes the
reaction.
Idaho is naturally a Republican
state. It is largely populated by peo
ple fron. Republican states, where Re
publican policies there as well as in
Idaho are best calculated to promote
their industries and consequently
their prosperity and business. Idaho
has always prospered under a Re
publican administration. It has al
ways been depressed under a Demo
cratic administration. The industries
that are prosperous in Idaho today
are so in spite of Democratic incom
petency and because of the misfor
tunes of our neighbors across the
seas. The normal Republican major
ity in Idaho is around 15,000. The
Republican party has never been de
feated in this state except by some
abnormal condition, of which there Is
no evidence this year, and success
seems certain.
First Political Advertising Stunt.
The first political advertising stunt
of the new year is to be credited to
Governor Moses Alexander. The day
after New Years he took a half page
in his local organ to try to make it
appear that he had reduced taxes. His
claims w'cre displayed in big black
type, like a sale of $20 overcoats for
$9.99. He alleged in this advertise
ment that he had reduced states taxes
14.8 per cent in Ada county, while
county taxes had been increased, ana
that if the Ada county taxpayer was
paying higher taxes than last year,
under Governor llaincs, the county
commissioncftts were to blame and
not the Governor. At least this was
the argument, if not the exact lan
guage. The ad. on the face of it
looked like a clincher, but the analy
sis of the figures makes it look like
thirty cents. If there be an Ada
county taxpayer whose tax bill is
just an even $100, he will find if he
investigates that only a small part ol
this goes to the state, less than $9.
Therefore, if the governor has reduc
ed state taxes in Ada countv 14.8 per
cent, the reduction would amount to
abount $1.56. The saving of $1.56 on
a tax bill of $100 is so insignificant as
to afford no material relief. Of course
even this small reduction is oom
mendable, but it does not begin to ful
fill the campaign promises of the gov
ernor, nor to justify his extravagant
charges that it was Republican extra
vagance at the state house that
caused high taxes. In this connection
it might be well to bear in mind that
during only one year in the history of
the state has there been a general and
a material reduction in taxes and that
was in 1914, under a Republican gov
ernor, aided by a tax commission,
which commission Governor Alexan
der had abolished, and the good start
for relief of the tax burden made un
der a Republican governor has been
lost by a Democratic governor.
FORBES WOULD CREATE
IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT
Expenditure of Approximately $125,
000.00 Suggested.
Monday evening at the régulât
meeting of the city council Alderman
Forbes proposed that steps be taken
toward the organization of improve
ment districts covering the entire
city. Mr. Forbes' plan contemplates
the expenditure of about $125,000.00
during the next few years. The im
provements provided for arc the ma
cadamizing of 12 miles of the princi
pal streets, the grading and sanding of
25 miles of less important streets, the
building of a trunk sewer- line o\l the
north side, the lowering of the pres
ent sewers on the north side in order
to connect with the trunk line, the
taking over by the city of the irriga
tion system, the installation of the
Gainwell fire alarm system, the pur
chase of a rock crusher, purchase of
auto street sprinkler and gravel truck,
and such minor and incidental impro
vements as seem to be demanded.
The proposal of Mr. Forbes was
taken under advisement. It will be
investigated. The Regular, routine
business of the session was trans
acted.
Missouri Democracy in Bad Shape.
(Lewiston Tribune, Democratic.)
The Democratic outlook must be
darker in Missouri than most of us
have imagined, if the idea of con
scripting Champ Clark for the guber
natorial nomination has come to be
thought worthy of consideration. Mr
Clark would not be drafted because
of any assumption of superior fitness
for the office of governor, for the
abilities that he has displayed in dis
tinguishing degree are such as would
be more likely to unfit than to fit him
for such duties. He would be drafted
in the belief that his personal popu
larity would offset the unpopularity
of his party at the present moment,
This hope would probably be disap
pointed. Mr. Clark's nomination for
governor would bring no Republicans
to the support of the Democratic
ticket, nor would it mollify the Ger
mans in the way apparently desired
Many of them might vote for him.
but they would not be reconciled to
Mr. Wilson. If the real purpose is
to save a Missouri seat in the senate
to the Democrats, why not nominate
Mr. Clark for the senate?
Miss Verna Horn entertained Tues
day evening at cards in honor of Miss
Ketchum of Boise. Those present
