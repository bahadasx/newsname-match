" Prevails Among Entente Allies That the, Muscovite Of

an Invasion of Salonild and Egypt
London, jan. 6,' ,10.15 p. m. The
area of Russian successes over , the
Auatro-German forces in the east con
tinues tol widen. . Although the situa
tion around Czernowitz has hot yet
been cleared up officially it appears
from advices from Russian sources
that the . Austrians are hard pressed
over a f long line of defense and are
throwing hugt reinforcements into Ihe i
district. . The Russians here Cf c ex
pected to strike at the Kolomea-Stan-Islau-jiallcz
line, where powerful de
fensive works have been in prepara
tion for some time by the Austro
Germans. Russian Positions Strengthened.
; Meanwhile , the Russian position 250
miles further north . on the middle
Styr river has been greatly strength
ened by successful operations in the
region of the great marshes, where the
Russians are beginning to emerge from
the marshes with prospects-of being
able to use the; roads leading either
northwest, west or southwest. Their
advance here has not been the result
of an isolated battle, but of a series
of .engagements lasting over a consid
erable . period. In the capitals of the
entente allies the- opinion is expressed
that the Russian offensive has com
pletely upset the plans of the central
powers for an invasion of Saloniki and

Commons Passes
Compulsory Bill
FIRST READING GETS DECISIVE
VOTE OF 403 TO 1oV
N ENTHUSIASTIC SCENE
The Announcement of the Figure Was
.
, Received With a Tremendous Out
burst of Cheering Balfour Closed
Debate With a Persuasive Appeal.
. London, Jan. 6, 11.B0 p. m. Amid
scenes of -wild enthusiasm the house
of commons tonight passed the first
reading of the bill for compulsory -military
service by the decisive vote- of
403 to 105.
The vote came shortly before mid
night, with the galleries again packed,
every seat on the floor of the house
occupied, the ministerial benches fill
ed and an air of eager expectancy pre
vailing. The events of the. day .had
increased the tension to a high pitch,
notably the action of the labor con
gress and the quick announcement of
the retirement of the three labor mem
bers of the ministry.
Balfour Roused ' Lagging Spirit.
Throughout these developments
outside of parliament the debate in
the house had forged steadily ahead,
but had been left largely to the lesser
figures. It was reserved for A. J. Bal
four, first lord of the admiralty, to
close the debate in behalf of the gov
ernment and he did it in a persuasive
appeal of half an hour, which roused
the lagging spirits of the advocates of
the bill and turned the tide of adver
sity, -which had been running steadily
against the measure through the de
bate and outside- events of the day.
"Let this vote tonight show that we
are a united people," was his closing
appeal. "Do not let us give a false
impression to the world that in the
moment of the country's gravest emer
gency we are divided one against an
other. : Abandon your abstract theories
and remember we are dealing with
stern realities which call for great sac
rifices." . Tremendous Outburst of Cheering.
Then came the vote. The announce
ment of the figures was received with
a tremendous outburst of cheering.
Scores of members in khaki waved
their handkerchiefs and the air was
sent with white papers flung in tri
umph at the government's success.
Premier Asquith Presented Bill.
' Amid the demonstration. Premier
Asquith, his face, usually pale, now
glowing with satisfaction, walked down
the floor of the house to present the
hilt. formally xo -the -cham twav- His-ap-
pearance was the signal for an ova
tion, members of all sides cheering.
Opposition Vote.
- An analysis of the 'Vote showed that
the government had held the great
bulk of the Liberal and Conservative
vote. The Irish Nationalists had voted
against the bill, but the Irish Unionists
supported the measure and the
O'Brienites took no part in the divi
sion. The minority showed a sprinkling
of liberal members, the most notable
being John Burns, the former cabinet
member. A number of . labor mem
bers also voted with the opposition.

Show Tendency to Enter th Field
of Diplomacy on European Matters.
Washington, Jan. 6. Mexico furnish,
ed the vehicle today for another dis
cussion of foreign relations on the
floor of the senate. It preceded the
adoption without opposition of a reso
lution offered by Senator Fall calling
on President Wilson for all available
information bearing upon the recogni

the United States.
Senators Fall and Lodge spoke in
support of the resolution, insisting that
the president should inform congress
fully concerning the situation before
the nomination of an ambassador to
Mexico waa confirmed.
Debate European Matter.
Senator Williams diverted attention
from Mexico in the course of the de
bate by commenting at length upon the
questions arising from the , European
war. He said an embargo on exporta
of munitions would "hamstring" the
United States more than any other
first class power.
Senator Borah wanted to know
whether the Mississippi senator
tnougnt that alter the war some Eu
ropean government would attack the
United States out of pure spirit of
conquest.
"I am not anticipating an attack, in
tne nrst piace. senator Williams re
plied. "I am anticipating bullying first
and I am anticipating the fact that
American people will not consent to
be bullied."
Plenty to Quarrel About.
He declared there would be plenty
to quarrel about, referring to repeated
torpedoing of unarmed merchant ships
by one nation and similar acts by the
ally of that nation after questions in
volved apparently had been settled by
diplomacy.
Field of Diplomacy.
"They are in the field of diplomacy
now and the president of the United
States has very wisely attempted to
keep them within the field of diploma
cy," he added. "I am sorry for one
tnat congress had to meet right now,
I think the management of our diplo
matic affairs would have been more
wisely handled toy a man long-vieioned
