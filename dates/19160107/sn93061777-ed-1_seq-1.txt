WILL PROHIBITION
PROHIBIT THE QUESTION
Taxpayer in Communication
and Urges Voters to Investigate Conditions in other
places that have tried it. Says Texico Saloons and
Bootlegging will be a constant menace if Prohibitioa
is Adopted.
The fight is on in earnest this
week, with Prohibition or Anti
Prohibition the issue.
The writer, who has resided
in Clovis since coming from
Prohibition territory, believes
that he can truthfully say that
he has seen more drunkenness
in pro territory than he has ever
seen in Clovis during his four
years residence here. While we
are a property owner and a tax
payer h?" we nnrt, n- w firm.
, be'iew th; t it Hit- .. wn yOts
" 'J " rln t i ro J ' r': values wili
We will see a repetition in Clovis
of what occurred in Artesia,
where most anybody will tell
you that just as soon as Prohi
bition became effective, the
town soon took on a "dead" ap
pearance. If prohibition was
the best for Roswell, why did
they vote it "Wet" again at the
next opportunity?
I do not care for reasons best
known to myself, to mix up in
this controversy, but I want to
drive home this fact; with
'IVxico full of saloons nine miles
away, and with several jitney
lires in operation between the
towns, PROHITION in Clovis
won't Prohibit. It will only
build up Texico with money that
should be spent here. This will
be the mecca for bootleggers,
and the cost of prosecuting them
(if they are caught), will fall
upon the taxpayers of Clovis
not the County of Curry or Btate
but upoi the citizens who pay to
keep up the city officers.
Clovis is a good town now,
where the saloons close at 12
o'clock and are regulated under
proper police protection. Lets
keep it that way and don't kill
it by depriving us of the revenue
that we now receive to properly
in Clovis
to News says that it Will Not
conduct it. Make the issue
County wide er Texico will
practically "kill" Clovis.
