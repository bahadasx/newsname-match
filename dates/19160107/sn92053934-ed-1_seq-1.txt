AFFIDAVITS OBTAINED
Consul Garrels of Alexandria
Gets Sworn Statements
From Survivors.
Washington. Jan. 7. Counsel
Carrels at Alexandria, Egypt, to
day advised the slate department
that he had secured affidavits from
21 survivors of the Persia, includ
ine ( harles 11. Grant, an Aniericun
citizen, and that all confirmed pre
vious statements that "no warn
ing was given and no vessel was
seen."
Officers and crew of the Persia,
the consul advised, haye left Alex
indria for England, where their
affidavits probably will be obtained
on arrival.
Consul barrels has been in
structed to forward summaries of
the affidavits lie has obtained.
Still lacking definite information on
which to base official action in the
crisis between the United States and
the central powers arising from the
sinking of the British steamer Persia,
although the disaster occurred more
than a week ago, President Wilson and
Secretary Lansing were hopeful today
that Ambassador Penfield at Vienna
would be able to clear up the situa
tion. Word was looked for from the
ambassador regarding the Vienna for
eign offie response to the ambassa
dor's inquiries on the subject.
Attention on Vienna.
Officials turned to Ambassador Pen
field after Consul Garrels at Alexan
dria, Egypt, had cabled that no new
facts were developed in the affidavits
had collected from the Persia's sur
vivors as to whether the liner had been
torpedoed. Hope then virtually was
given up of obtaining conclusive proof
from that source.
It had been expected that the sub
marine crisis would be considered at
cabinet meeting today and also by
the senate foreign relations committee.
The committee met today for the first
time in executive session. It was dis
closed today, after official text of Aus
tria's reply to the second American
note in the Ancona case had been
made public, that no response would
be made until the facts in the case of
the Persia are clear or it is found im
possible to do so.
The official text varies only in
translation with the unofficial version
of the cables in press dispatches from
London. It is regarded as meeting all
of the American demands.
The Austro-Hungarian government
until the night of Jan. was without
information concerning the sinking of
the Persia, according to a dispatch re
ceived today by the state department
from Ambassador Penfield at Vienna.

THIRTY HURT
IN SMASHUP;
ONE MAY DIE
Chicago, Jan. 7. With one exception,
all of the 30 passengers injured and
burned in the wreck or an mteruroan i
car on the Chicago and Milwaukee
electric railway near Wilmette, a sub
urb, last night, are expected to re
cover, say attending physicians.
A man, whose identity has not been
established, and who has not regained
consciousness, is not expected to live,
the physicians said. Several of the
passengers taken to hospitals in Evans
ton and the Kenilworth sanitarium
were able to leave after their injuries
had been dressed.
The car, which witnesses said was
traveling at high speed, bounded off
the track as it struck a curve, turned
over and then caught fire. The fact
that the car was steel prevented a se
rious loss of life, it was declared.
Mrs. James Kibb and Miss Louise I
Adams of Highland Park were serious- j
iv hiirnpd when the stove in the car i
tipped over, showering them with
burning coals. Part of their clothing
was burned from their bodies.
William Oppenheimer of Highwood,
111., motorman of the car, was taken
into custody by the police pending an
Investigation. He was unable to make
a coherent statement regarding the
accident. It is believed he suffered a
blow on the head, which affected his
mind.
A warrant for the motorman of the
wrecked car, Oscar Oppenheimer,
charging him with criminal careless
ness, was sworn out by the Wilmette
chief of. police and a hearing set for
tomorrow.
Investigation of the cause of tha
wreck was begun today by officers of
the United States district court at the
direction of Judge Landis. The village
board of Wilmette and county officials
also began inquiries into the accident.

CASETOJURY
Famous New Haven Trial
Closes With Giving of
the Instructions.
ROCKEFELLER ABSENT
Is Only One of Eleven Indict
ed Directors Not Present
Not Required.
"ew Tork, Jan. 7. The case
against William Rockefeller and
1(1 other former directors of the
w York, 'evv Haven and Hart
ford railroad, charged with crim
inal conspiracy under the Sherman
law, was submitted to the jury to
day. William Rockefeller was the only
one of the 11 defendants not in court
when Judge Hunt began his instruc
tions to the jury today in the case
against former directors of the New
York, New Haven and Hartford rail
road, accused of violating the Sher
man law. As the charge against the
defendant is a misdemeanor his pres
ence was not legally required. The
court, after describing the indictment,
first instructed the jury that the case
should be considered without regard
to any testimony that would indicate
"any attempts to influence legislation
by bribery or corrupt means." The
indictment contained no such charge,
he said. .
Defines Limit of Sherman Act
Discussing the Sherman' act, he said
that it did not prescribe 'a limit to
acquisitions and that large enterprises
may in a certain sense be permitted to
monopolize commerce. Magnitude of
business was not in itself a violation
of a law.
"The criminal act," he said, "is in
conspiring to restrain freedom of ac
tion and unduly restricting or sup
pressing competition."
The first question for the jury to de
cide, he said, was whether "back in
1S90 or thereabouts there existed a
conspiracy to monopolize commerce. If
the government does not satisfy you
that a conspiracy existed at that time,
then the whole case of the government
fails."
The'court held that the charge also
could not be sustained unless the jury
was satisfied that the defendants or
any of them "intended to enter an il-
legal combination." Intent, he said, J
was psychological and not to be ascer
tained by fixed rule of law.

Washington, Jan. 7. Representative
Gardner was vigorously assailed to
day In the house by two republican
colleagues, Stafford and Cooper, of
Wisconsin when he made a speech
criticising German-Americans and the
German nation.
"The remarks we have Just heard
were as violent as would have been
made in the British parliament,"
shouted Mr. Cooper, who is the rank
ing member of the foreign affairs com
mittee. Mr. Stafford In an impassioned ad
dress, declared Mr. Gardner to be
"more British than American," criti
cized him for the nature of his remarks
"when every member should weigh
his words carefully" and strongly de
fended German-Americans. Mr. Stafford
took particular exception to the dec
laration that German-Americans were
destroying American munition factor
ies with their "gold and dynamite"
and resented, "this baseless charge,
which is unworthy of any man."
Mr. Gardner left the house just as
Mr. Stafford began.

LINER
ORSIN
ORTATLAST
New York, Jan. 7. The 177 passen
gers who were forced to abandon the
sinking Greek steamship Thessaloniki
at sea arrived here today on the
steamship Patris of the same line and
gave vivid descriptions of the hard-1
ships they suffered in the five weeks
the Thessaloniki wa3 battered by ter
rific gales.
On Christmas day the supply of
meat on the Thessaloniki was exhaust
ed, only a few gallons of water were i
left and the ship's officers began to
portion out short rations. I
The Thessaloniki first sprung a leak j
when she encountered a hurricane!
which raged for 12 hours Dec. 21. The
boiler and engine rooms were partly
flooded and the steamer sent out calls
for assistance. After the hurricane
subsided the ship was pumped out and
proceeded on her voyage.
Rough seas and gales were encoun
tered from Dec. 22 to Dec. 26 when
the Thessaloniki ran into a 90-mile
hurricane which lasted for 24 hours.
Many of the passengers and crew fear
ed the steamer was sinking, as fresh
leaks were opened and the boiler and
engine rooms and coal bunkers rapidly
filled with water.
It was then that the Thessaloniki
sent out numerous "S. 0. S." calls
which were heard by the Patris,
United States, Florizel and other
steamers. The Florizel was the first
to reach the disabled vessel and of
fered to take oft the passengers and
crew and carry them to Bermuda.
Captain Goulandis, who was making
his first voyage as a master, declined
this offer. The Florizel stood by until
the Patris came in sight
The Thessaloniki's passengers were
transferred to the Patris with consid
erable difficulty and were forced to
leave all of their baggage and per
sonal belongings on the disabled ves
sel. After the transfer the Patris shot
a line to the Thessaloniki and took her
in tow Jan. 1. The wind increased
greatly during the night and early the
following morning the tow line parted.
That afternoon the Patris got another
line to the Thessaloniki, but the cable
parted again Jan. 3 and the Thessa
loniki was driven rapidly southeast
before a cyclonic snowstorm.
Owing to the Thessaloniki's engines
being stopped by the water in the ship's
hold she was only able to send out in
frequent wireless calls, which covered
a small area. The Patris took up the
search and was joined by the Scandi
navian steamer United States, which
had turned out of her course to give
assistance.

PROPOSE END
IN LUSITANIA
AFFAIR.CLAIM
Controversy Over Sinking of
Steamer Believed to Be
Near Close.
GERMANS WILL GIVE IN
Offers for Amicable Settle
ment Arrive at Wash
ington From Berlin.
Washington, Jan. 7 Proposals
which the German government be
lieves will end the controversy
over the Lusitania disaster In a
manner satisfactory to the United
States were understood to have
been received here today from
!c rlin. Count Ton Bernstorff had
an appointment with Secretary
Lansing this afternoon.
Germany is believed to have agreed
to pay an indemnity for the Americans
lost when the Lusitania was tor
pedoed; at the same time basing a
reservation of any wrong-doing on
the contention that the destruction of
the vessel was an act of reprisal in
retaliation for the British blockade of
Germany.
Germany is also understood to be
ready to give assurances that her sub
marine commanders in the Mediter
ranean will not torpedo without warn
ing privately owned vessels of any de
scription, including liners, freighters
and tramp steamers. German assur
ances in regard to submarine warfare
in the North sea include only liner
in passenger service.
let Cat Out of Bag.
The assurances regarding the con
duct of submarine warfare in the
Mediterranean convey the first infor
mation that German submarines were
operating there. In excluding all s'hips
escept liners from the assurances cov
ering submarine warfare in the North
sea, the German government was rep
resented as considering that no Amer
icans could possibly be aboard ships
other than liners in regular passen
gers carrying service.
It was also stated with authority to
day that Germany virtually had agreed
with the position of the United States
in regard to small boats not being,
under all conditions, a place of safety
for passengers aboard a ship about to
be destroyed.
To Pay Indemnity.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, presented to Secretary
Lansing today a proposal to pay in
demnity for Americans lost in the
Lusitania disaster, and thereby con
clude that controversy. He gave as
surances that no German submarines
in the Mediterranean would attack
non-combatant ships without warning
or destroy them without opportunity
for non-combatants to reach safety.
W'hile offering to pay indemnity in
the Lusitania case, Germany makes
the reservation that it is done without
admission of wrong doing. No official
indication was given as to the accept
ability of the proposal, but one set of
American officials took the view that
it would end the controversy The
assurances regarding submarine war
fare in the Mediterranean are of
broader scope than those given after
the Arabic disaster, and covering the
warfare in the North Sea. The latter
guaranteed only the safety of liners.
Those for Mediterranean cover all
non-combatant ships.
Count von Bernstorff also told Sec
retary Lansing his government had
heard of the sinking of the Persia
through news dispatches, but had no
other information.
British Submarine Sunk.
London, Jan. 7, (11:27 a. m.) The
