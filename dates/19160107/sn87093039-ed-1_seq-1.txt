Vol. 13. No. 1
OLD COUNCIL STEPS
ASIDE FOR THE NEW
New Body Assumes Its Duties—Mayor
Day's Appointments all Approved
—Session Very Harmonious
The old city council held an ad
journed meeting Tuesday evening for
the purpose of administering the oath
of office to the new mayor and treas
urer, and the four recently elected
councilmen. All members were pres
ent except Snyder and Wheeler.
Alter expressing his tlaanks to the
council for the support he had received
from them during his administration
retiring Mayor Woodrow introduced
the new mayor N. V. Day. Mayor
Day made a short address and then
expressed his ideas of the most import
ant matters to be considered in the fol
lowing recommendations:
To the City Council of Leavenworth,
Wash.:
Gentlemen: — It is with pleasure
that I have the opportunity to submit
to you my ideas as Mayor of the City
of Leavenworth for the ensuing year.
Gentlemen, the retiring council saw
paoper in the first place to employ one
of the very best law firms in the state
for an opinion as to whether or not the
city had a chance to recover from Sea
man & Quigg et al any amount of
money that was overpaid to said firm
in the construction of the water system
of Leavenworth. After receiving a
favorable reply from this law firm they
were undecided as to what action to
take and consequently submitted the
matter to the vote of the people at the
last election, and the people by a
handsome majority voted to carry the
matter thru the courts. Now, gentle
men, some of you as well as myself
were selected by the same people on
the same issue, and it becomes our
duty to act on this issue. I recom
mend to you the close consideration of
this matter that we may carry out the
wishes of the people without fear of
the results.
Another thing, gentlemen. As you
well know, within the last eighteen
months Leavenworth has suffered three
very disastrous fires, and it seems now
high time for us to act or assist in or
ganizing a volunteer fire department,
and I recommend that you take steps
to carry out said plan at the earliest
possible moment.
And now that the state has gone dry
and we have a statute prohibiting the
unlawful distribution of intoxicating
liquors, let us get behind our Chief of
Police and Police Judge and give them
all the assistance that is possible to en
force the law.
Respectfully submitted,
N. V. Day.
These recommendations were favor
ably receive and were ordered placed
on file and made part of the records.
The mayor then named the following
committees:
Finance—Featherstone, Snyder and
Woldenberg.
Police, Fire, Light—Seeley, Kugel
man and Featherstone,
Street and Alley—Miller, Hale and
Snyder.
Park— Snyder, Seeley, and Kugel
man.
Building —Hale, Featherstone and
Miller.
W»te» —Kugelman, Seeley and Wol
denberg.
The following appointments were
then made by the mayor and approved
by council without a dissenting voice.
Chief of Police—S. A. Potter.
Water and Street Commissioner —C.
E. Tolbert.
Police Judge—P. H. Graham.
•"•HaithOflcer— Dr. 1,8, Judah.
Purchasing Agent —A. R. Brown.
After a little discussion in regard to
to putting the fire apparatus, hose reel,
etc., on runners the matter was left to
the fire committee with power to act.
Council then adjourned and will
have its first regular meeting next
Tuesday.

INSURANCE SETTLED
OWNERS TO REBUILD
The Investment Company Will Let Con
tract at Once--Postoffice will
Go Back in Same Place
It is with considerable satisfaction
that we are able to announce that the
block of buildings burned on the night
of December 26th will be rebuilt at
once. This decision was arrived at
Tuesday when a meeting of the direc
tors of the Investment Co. was held.
Work will commence as early as possi
ble, as the postal authorities have de
cided that they will take the old quar
ters, Mr. O. S. Sampson having re
ceived a letter from the inspector at
Spokane to that effect this week. For
the present, or until the new quarters
are ready the postoffice will remain in
the old quarters of the Tumwater Bank.
The loss on the Investment Com
pany's building was adjusted Tuesday,
as was also the loss on postoffice fix
tures and the Furniture Co's stock.
On the building, which carried insur
ance of $5500 the Toss was adjusted at
84,400, and on the postoffice fixtures,
which belonged to the Investment Co.
the loss was fixed at $1,400, which
was only one hundred dollars under the
insurance. The Furniture Co. had
$3,000 worth of insurance and were
paid $2,800. On the Palace store
stock, which was insured for $7,500
and the loss claimed at from $15,000
to $17,000, negotiations for settlement
are still in progress.
HEAVY SNOW INJURES
YOUNG APPLE TREES
Owners of Young Orchards in the Upper
Valley Fear Injury by Splitting
Off the Lower Limbs
From Cashmere up the snowfall has
been so heavy, now amounting to some
three to over five feet on a level, that
owners of young orchards especially
fear that the lower limbs on all the
trees will be split off by the snow. A
number of orchard owners in this vicin
ity tell us that as the lower limbs are
being covered and the snow melts the
crust will cany the limbs down with
the snow and split them off the trunk
of the tree. Many owners have men
at work shoveling the snow from around
the trees, but where the orchard is
large this is an expensive undertaking
and it requires considerable time to go
over the orchard. Trees seven or
eight years old are not so liable to
damage from this source because the
limbs are not so close to the ground
and are larger and better able to stand
the strain before breaking.
The engagement of Miss Edna
Featherstone and Mr. C. Warren Reid
was announced Thursday afternoon
when Mrs. Lloyd Durand entertained
the Dix club at a 4 o'clock luncheon.
The following members were present:
Mesdames Ruth Smith, Marguerite
Sampson, Mabel Daly, Doris Brender,
Sadie Roth, Agnes Mitchell and Misses
Freda Gardner, Bess Walker and Edna
Featherstone. Mrs. Dude Brown and
Miss Margaret Reid were guests.

Leavenworth, Wash., Friday, January 7, 1916
TRAIN COLLISION NEAR
TYE SUNDAY AFTERNOON
Passenger No. 26 Smashes Into Stalled
Freight—No One Killed, but About
Twenty-Five Slightly Hurt
Due to the error or omission of the
telegrapher at Embro, in giving out two
staffs for one block, passenger train No.
26 eastbound from Seattle collided
with a westbound freight train Sunday
afternoon a few miles west of Ty?.
Both engine crews jumped and escaped
injury, but the locomotives were badly
wrecked. No one was killed, owing to
the fact that the impact was compara
tively light for a head-on collision, as
No. 26 was climbing the grade and
making only 12 or IS miles an hour,
while the freight, due to a fortunate
misapplication of the brakes, was at a
standstill. Had the latter train been
running at usual speed the resulting
loss of life might have been appalling.
As it was, the passengers were tossed
about like ninepins and about twenty
five of them were leported by Dr. G.
W. Hoxsey, the Great Northern physi
cian, as suffering fiom bumps, bruises,
scratches and cuts. The dining car,
in which dinner was being served at
the time of the accident, was thoroly
messed up and the chef scalded and
considerably bruised.
Dr. Hoxsey was notified and went up
from here on the wrecker, reaching
the scene about 4p. m. He adminis
tered first aid to all, and wired Dt.
Culp at Wenatchee to meet the train
at that point and look after the injured
ones getting off there.
Miss Norene Costello, a teacher in
the primary depaitment of the Leaven
worth school, who was returning from
her vacation on the Sound, was thrown
thru the rear end window of the obser
vation car and landed mostly on her
head. She was unconscious for some
time and is still on leave of absence,
her place in the school being tempora
rily filled by Miss Warren, the instruc
tor in music. Miss Elsie Myer, an
other local teacher; Miss McLean of
the Mutual Mercantile Co.; Mrs. Chas.
Anderson and Miss Frances Lindsay
were also home-comers on the train,
but were fortunate in escaping damage
of any nature.
Harry Thurmond of Seattle, one of
the owners of the Golden Eagle mine
at Blewett, who was on his way here
to transact business in connection with
the mine, was bruised about the ribs.
Mrs. C. B. Fly of Cashmere was
found to be in need of medical aid,
and a young lady connected with the
Cashmere school was also severely
bruised.
The accident delayed the train about
five hours.
RAILROAD RUMBLINGS
J. H. O'Neill, general superintend
ent; F. D. Kelsey, superintendent; T.
J. Clark, master mechanic; F. W
Stiles, roadmaster, were in town Mon
day making an inspection and helping

G. S. Stewart, assistant general super
intendent, spent Tuesday around the
terminal.
Brakeman H. J. Myers has relumed
after spending Christmas at home in
Snohomish.

WELL, WHAT DO SOCIETY
FOLKS THINK Of THIS ?
Mr. Wm. A. Decker and Miss Clara Mc-
Nabb Married at Colfax, Wash.
Last August
The friends and acquaintances of
these two well known young people
were taken clean off their feet this
week whin the news leaked out that
they had been married nearly six
months when they left here just before
Christmas for Spokane, where some
how the belief prevailed that they were
to be married at the home of a friend
of the groom, and then go on a bridal
tour to Michigan.
Shocked? No, hardly that, but the
wise ones, those that usually know all
about such matters, or are supposed to,
confess they had one slipped over on
them. You never can tell when one
of these old bachelors turns a matri
monial trick just how its going to be
done. "Foxey Quiller," the boys
say, "and sly Miss Pussy McNabb,
slipped of! last summer and got mar
ried without telling anybody about it.
Kept it a secret for nearly six months."
Sounds more like a chapter from one
of Robert W. Chamber's society novels.
One can almost remember having seen
the same thing at a moving picture
show last week, and it all happened
right here at home, and the living,
moving actors are known to everybody.
Real folks in fact. Well, book things
do happen in real life sometimes.
Mr. Decker is an old time, popular
railroad man, and a fine fellow. Miss
McNabb had been one of the teachers
in our public school for the past three
years and had a host of friends. They
left here a few days before Christmas
for Spokane, where it was generally
understood they were to be married at
the home of a friend of Mr. Decker's
and then go on a wedding tour and
visit with Decker's parents in Michigan
where, by the way, they are at present.
It is also understood that Mr. and Mrs.
Deckes will be here about Feb. Ist,
and doubtless they will meet with a
warm reception.
Opening of Franklin Hotel
This old hostelry, first called the
Hotel Franklin, and then changed to
The Chikamin, has again gone back to
its original name under the manage
ment of Mr. F. A. Losekamp, who
spent some three or four thousand the
past three months in overhauling and
refurnishing the building until it is
now one of the most modern hotels in
Central Washington. The place was
formally opened to the public the first
of the year. Mr. Losekamp spared
neither pains nor money in installing
every hotel convenience, even to a
$300 phonograph, to wake the guests
with music in the morning. Frank is
a great hustler and it is a cold day
when he gets left. That he will get
his full share of the hotel business goes
without saying.
Dave Evans, whilom dispenser of
refreshments to the bibulous at the
Tom Burke resort, will leave next week
for Montana where he expects to make
his home in the future.
Mrs. O'Rourke and daughter Mary,
and Miss Laura Murphy are spending
a few days in Spokane among relatives
and triends.
BUSINESS MEN TRYING
TO OBEY NEW DRY LAW
Grocers, Druggists and Dealers in Maga
zines Having Trouble to Learn
Just What is the Law
If the dry law is violated by any of
our business men who have in the past
dealt in wares, ihe sale of which was
not prohibited, such as flavoring ex
tracts, perfumes and bitters, containing
a percentage of alcohol; magazines and
newspapers containing liquor advertise
ments, and many other things not here
enumerated, that are under the law
prohibited, the violation will be unin
tentional. Several have called up this
office in an effort to obtain a copy of
the law in order to post themselves
and avoid a violation. One curious
phase of the law relates to the sale of
newspapers or mapazines containing an
advertisement offering for sale any of
the articles prohibited. Yet these same
newspapers and magazines may be sent
thru the mail and received by the sub
scriber without violating the law. Yet
a dealer may not sell the same maga
zine or paper without subjecting him
self to a fine.
A lot of articles advertised and sold
as medicines contain alcohol in a quan
tity prohibited. All the flavoring ex
tracts, perfumes, cordials and bitters
will come under the prohibition law.
Alcohol is the best known vehicle for
carrying and at the same time preserv
ing the quality of flavoring matter and
perfume. The new law will therefore
work a hardship, not only on the dealer
but the housewife. In calling for flav
oring extracts or perfumes, with a per
fectly legitimate object, the housewife
will be forced to encourage a violation
of the law.
It becomes more evident every day
that violations and prosecutions will
come by people who are wholly inno
cent of any unlawful intent. Like
many other laws, hurriedly and care
lessly drawn, the dry law will need
overhauling and interpretation by the
higher courts before we all know just
"where we are at."
TROUT AND SALMON
fOR CHELAN WATERS
Millions of Baby Fish for Our Lakes and
Streams—Leavenworth Hatchery
Will Supply the Trout
During the past year over a million
trout fry were liberated in the streams
of Chelan county, says Superintendent
Baldridge of the fish hatchery, most of
which were developed right here under
his supervision. In addition to these
a large number were shipt in here from
other hatcheries and liberated in the
nearby streams.
Plans have been made by the county
game commissioners to plant fry on a
more extensive basis this year. At the
hatchery there are 250,000 silver lake
fry which will be planted during April.
It is planned to take 3,000,000 cut
throat spawn from Twin lakes in the
spring. Additional fry will be ob
tained from other hatcheries in the
state. Besides this, 1,400,000 chi
nook salmon, which were hatched here
last fall, will be liberated in the Wenat
chee river early in the spring.
Had a Delightful Time
The Eight-Cylinder Club, recently
organized by a number of young men,
held their first banquet Saturday even
ing at the home ol Mrs. Chas. Anderson.
Cards, music and other social diversions,
with an unusually excellent dinner,
made the evening a most enjoyable
one. Those present were, Clifford
Hayes, John Mclntosh, Leonard Wun
der, Norman Nelson, Harry Wolden
berg, Harold Woldenberg, Carl and
Max Anderson.
Mr. O. S. Sampson will entertain a
number of friends at a stag dinner at
his home this evening.

Special Revival Services
The special revival services at the
Methodist church will begin with the
evening service next Sunday and will
be held every night in the week ex
cept Monday night. That will be the
rest night. The pastor will be the
evangelist. With a consecrated church
and a pastor who is anxious to have
Christ welcomed in every home, work
ing together, the results will be much
more satisfactory than by any other
method. We do not aim to be eccen
tric, or abuse the congregation, but do
expect to "preach the Truth in Love."
You are cordially invited to attend
these meetings, and all Christians are
urged to come out and to feel at
home. Yours for a better Leaven
worth. F. L. Moore, Pastor.
ICE-MAKING PLANT
ADDED TO CREAMERY
Capacity of Four Tons Per Day—Will
Supply Local Demand—Ready
For Businss by Spring
The directors of the creamery com
pany have practically decided to add
an ice-making plant to the creamery,
which will be located in an addition to
be erected on the north side of the
present building. The machinery will
be installed in time to supply the local
hot-weather demand as well as the ice
required by the creamery. The out
put will be about four tons per day.
Speaking yesterday with the mana
ger, Mr. Van Brocklin, he said that for
the past month the cream deliveries
had increased in number over those of
the month before, but there had been
a small shrinkage in the total quantity.
He further said that from such informa
tion as came to him he was confident
that the cream deliveries would increase
with the opening of spring and would
very likely double the quantity brought
in during the winter months. There
has never been any trouble in dispos
ing of every pound of butter made.
The trouble so far has been to supply
the demand. The outDut is giving the
best of satisfaction, the quality compar
ing with the best obtainable anywhere.
One by One, They Fade Away
Another week or two and the haunts
that knew them once will know them
no more forever, unless the voters of
the state reverse themselves at the next
election and Washington once more
becomes wet. Eighteen men found
employment in and about the six sa
loons tnat went out of business with
the advent of the dry law on the first
of the year, and a half-dozen Japs who
acted the part of swampers, and will
probably remain here and follow other
and less lucrative occupations. With
the exception of four or five all the
others have already gone to new pas
tures or contemplate going in a few
days. Of course all these men spent
money here, but then they were not
producers of money. They simply
spent the money that others made, and
the money they spent will not follow
them to other wheres.
