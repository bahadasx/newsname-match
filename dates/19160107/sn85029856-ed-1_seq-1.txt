Enthusiasm Is Growing
The automobile racing fever has hit
Liberal in virulent form, and much
' interest is being shown in the eon
1 temp'a'ed race for February 1. Sev-
eral out-of-town car owners have al
ready written to Urim;h & Llaughman
j for dope on the race, en' ranee fee,
purse, and other infoimation. and a
good bunch of entries is locked for,
J ilowever, we have been asked to sug-
) gest that those who in'en t to panicl-
pate in the race should let the fact
be known right awuv, and as fast as
the entries are'mude the money paid
in will ne displayed in the Griilith
& Hauiihma'i window. It is already
A certain that ten cars will enter, and
more are expected later on. They
1 will leave Liberal at intervals of live
minutes. Most of the participants
'yave expressed a desire for the Dodge
0 Ity-Garden City run. instead of the
J lugoton-Guynion course. The roads
f ' along the lirst course are in better
shape and the people along the rou'e
are taking more interest in the race.
V I'ete Webber of Hugoton has an
j Overland-six cocked and primed for
i the occasion. H. H. Eidson will be
( there witli a Kuick-slx, and Farmer
Corrigan will undoubtedly show ud
with the Buick that walked orf with
the first prize in the last contest.
Corrlgan's average on that trip was a
little over 40 miles per hour, but If be
gets in on this race he intends to set
a rock on the gas pedal. Dixon, who
once drove a Ford through the key
hole of a door, has misplaced his en
gine somewhere, and if lie locates it
between now andhe day set for the
race he intends to kick in with his
Hennery. J. J. Cilvert is breaking a
Dodge Into fast society by slow and
painful degree, and hopes totiave it at
least half way civilized before the race.
Jim says, however,- that he intends
to make that race if he has to tie his
car to Dixon's "goat". Marlon Mann
will enter a Reiral if the other fellows
will accept his money, of which there
is some doubt, as t lie promoters of
the race don't want to encourage
reckless spending by one who is hard
ly in a position to afford it, but if
Marion will only threaten them with
the time-honored mandamus suit we
believe they will open up their hearts.
O. M Clouse of Hutchinson, better
known as "Jawn D.," was the insti
gator of the former race, and made a
goof it, too..- His present where
abouts is known by the local Sher
lock Holmes, and It is hoped to have
him captured and on hand when
the time comes to start the wheels
rolling.
Dr. P. F. Hanlln left Tuesday for
Hutchinson, where lie will attend the
Chiropractors' association going on
there this week.
Mrs. J. W. Wall returned Saturday
from Guymon) where she spent the
holidays with her parents, Mr. and
Mrs. J. M. Voiles.
O. T. Wood came down from Toke
ka the last of the week to look after
business matters around here a few
days.

Review of the Past Year
The year 1!U5 was of such vast im
portance to the world at large that
we feel called upon t" give our read
ers a brief resume of i'8 happenings.
On another page of this issue of The
Democrat you will find "Review of
the great War and Other Notable
Events or the Year 1915." The prep
aration of this article involved con
siderable time and expense and we
can vouch for its accuracy. After
you have read the article It -would be
a good Idea to file this paper away for
future reference.
Eugene Martin, Harold Sutton and
Hugh Funk returned Sunday to Law
rence where tbey are attending the
Kansas University.
School opened Monday after a two
weeks' vacation and the pupils have
again settled down to the grind.
Mls9 Ruth Glenn, who spent her
Christmas vacation here with her par
ents, Mr. and Mrs. G. M. Glenn, re
turned the first of the week to her
studies In Wlchltii. Miss Ruth is
making a record in her work that will
be mighty hard to beat when gradtiat
ing time comes.
ASK YOUR MERCHANT
NATURALLY you have given
some attention and thought to
the matter of a Bank Account as a
means of getting ahead faster, but
Have you ever talked to your Mer

the personal advantages that would ac
crue to you through having an ac
count of your own? Any good busi
ness man will tell you the Bank Ac
count Way is the only SAFE way of
handling your financial affairs. Your

Amusements
Geo. W. Attebery's original new
scenic production of the quaint com
edy of Hie Oarks, "The Missouri
Boy" comes to the Liberal Opera
House, Wednesday, January, 12. The
scenes of tills popular comedy are laid
in and around the rural districts of
the Ozark mountains of Missouri,
during the construction of a large
transcontinental railroad, depicting
the old Homesteader's efforts to hold
their lands against the Octopus. A
story famllar to all, with the purest
of romance and quaintest of comedy,
makes "The Missouri Boy," the most
successful dramatic ''hit" of the de
cade, produced bv a strong metropoli
tan company, scenically and artistic
ally perfect.
Mrs. W. R. Molthop will resume
her teaching the tirst of next week, tf
faul S. Woods, a national bank ex
aminer was here this week and gave
the First National of Liberal its semi
annual examination. He also exam
ined the national banks of surround
ing towns while here. Mr. Woods is
a cousin of Cashier Woods of the First
National, and reports that institu
tion in its usual good condition.
hon Jackson, who is running the
W. O. Woods elevator at Fowler,
came home Saturuay to spend Sunday
with his family.
J. T. Masters and wife of Newton,
Kansas, spent Christmas with his
daughter, Mrs. E. J. Stutsman, and
family.
Agent J. II. Hemphill of the Rock
Island left Tuesday for Lincoln, Ne
braska, to lie gone about ten days.
We could tell a secret on "Hemp" if
we wanted to, but have promised not
to say anything aoout It.
.Mrs. Lillian Mann and children
have just returned from a visit to
Indiana. They report lots of snow
and cold weather at that place. Mrs.
Mann's sister, Mrs. Teter Gasser, ac
companied her home for a short visit.
Must of the students and teachers
w ho came to Liberal to celebrate the
holidays with relatives and friends
have returned to their respective
places of learningor teaching. When
all thes-e folks leave town at once It
makes quite a dent in the population,
a good Indication that the folks of
Liberal are strong advocates of high
er education.
Could This be True?
There spems to lie an unolllclal
rumor among railroad circles t hat the
Rock Island division headquarters,
now located at Dalhart, will he
moved to Liberal in the near luuiro.
This will Include the superintendent,
chief despatcher, master mechanic,
master carpenter, and a number of
other officials who will make Liberal
their headquarters If the move is
made, besides making Liberal a pass
enger division point. Nothing deli
nate or official regarding the move Is
known among tfle' local force, or If
there is they are keeping mighty
mum about it, but if there are any
grounds on which the cont emplated
project could be verified the business
men of Liberal ought to get busy and
hurry it alng as much as possible.
It would be a tine thing for the town
in more ways than one, not the least
of which would be the addition to
the monthly payroll of the company
at this point.
The New Sanford Opened
A. I'. Sanford, who has conducted
the Sanford hotel at the corner of
Kansas avenue and Third street for
nearly four years, moved tlie equip
ment of that hostelry last week to
I he new brick recently erected by
Ray Mat kin. The new hotel will be
known as the New Sanford. and Mr.
Sanford will continue the manage
ment. The' oK'iilng meal was a t
o'clock dinner last Sunday tl at was
well pat r iiiled hy the people of the
town and the traveling men who
happened to he In town that day.
Mu-ic as furnished by Mr. Domingo
and Miss May FiokI.
Tim New Sanford Is beyond a
doubt the finent ho'el between
Hutchinson mid El I'aso. It con.
tains 42 rooms and the dining room
lias sealing capacity for 44 people,
which can be increased to f0 should
the emergency arise. The Interior is
lixed up In magnlticent style and
every room lias an Inviting appear
ance. The building Is equipped
with all the latest conveniences
found In hotels In t"wns several
times the size of Liberal, and the en
tire Interior speaks well tor the pro
gressive Ideas of the owner of the
bulldlmr as well as the proprietor.
Mr. Sanford is a hotel man of the
right kind and no town has ever
suffered a bad name by reason of any
thing that ever happened in one of
his institutions.
The building recently used as the .
Sanford will now become the Old San
ford and is to lie a rooming house
on the European plan. Mrs. Llnna
Cole will lie the landlady. The Dem
ocrat bespeaks a good patronage for
Mr. and Mrs. Sanford In their new
quarters.
The Guymon Herald Sold
Warren Zimmerman who has
piloted the Guymon Herald through
nine years of more or less turbulent
existence, sold Ids interest In that
sheet this week to Jack Denny, his
linotype operator, and will retire from
thestrenu us life for a short time.
'Am makes no explanation legnrdlng
hi future activities but we can
make one thundering good guess as
to what they will be. He is a news
paper man of parts and the scent of
battle will soon overcome him, that
much is certain. The Democrat also
extends the glad hand to the Her
ald's new proprietor, and hopes he can
carry on the good work where Zlm.
left off.
Judge R. L. Howsley of Guymon;.
county Judge of Texas county, came
up Wednesday to place himself un
der the care of Dr. Pellette. Ther
judge has been a little run down at
the heel for several months and we
hope tiie treatments will put him
back in running shape in a short
time.
