RUSSIANS GAINING POWER
Teutonic Allies Threaten to Expel
French and British from
Macedonian Positions.
LONDON, Jan. 7.?According to
official advices from Vienna the
lighting on the eastern from has decreased
in violence, the Russians
having ceased to attack with vigor
Deuveen me Fripet ana ine uessarabian
frontier. The only gain olilcially
announced for the ltusslans
yesterday was at Czartorysk, the
scene of many sanguinary struggles,
where it is said the Austrians were
driven from the cemetery.
Any advance in this region will
threaten Kovel, one of the strongest
Austro-Gernian positions. It is believed
that even though no further
gain should be made Russian forces
have attained a position, which will
give the nation a degree of power In
Balkan affairs it has not had since
its armies were driven back from
the Carpathians.
The Teutonic allies still threaten
to expel the French and British from
their Macedonian positions, but no
> forward move has been detected thus
far In that direction. Strong Turkish
forces are said to be concentrating
in the' Thracian frontier of
Greece and it is sugestcd the Turks
may attempt to make good some of
the territorial loBses they suffered
in the Balkan wars.
The British public is still concerned
chiefly with the domestic crisis.
Notwithstanding the heavy majority
for the compulsion bill on first
reading lit the House of Commons
I he press Is speculating on the possibility
of a breakup, of the political
truce with a! general election as the
final chapter or the controversy.

And Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
Company is Taking a
Leading Part.
(IAICIAL TO THC TIL CORAM)
BALTIMOHB, Jan. 7.?In accordance
with its policy of public relations,
tbe Baltimore and Ohio railroad,
through \V. B. Mitchell, representative
of tho company ut Atlanta,
: On., Ik taking nn active and loading
i part in tlie campaign to atamp out the
| citrus canker which threatens destrucI
tion to the grape fruit Industry.
Mr. Mitchell recently vlsltod the
grapefruit groves'of the South to se|
cure first-hand information as to tbe
i serious effect of the canker blight on
! one of tho principal industries of the
! soutboust, und since that time he baB
brought the facts to tbe attention of
President Wilson and large business
1 Interests of the country.
1 The seriousness of the situation presented
by the canker was set forth in
I a recent editorial la the Atlanta Cou1
stitittlAi. which suld:
; "Both from the standpoint of preservation
of tho supply of citrus fruits,
l and of tho prosperity of a neighboring
state which is seriously threatened,
Georgians are keenly interested lu the
i efforts now lielng made to provide a
means for exterminating the disastrous
cltrua canker which Is seriously
threatening the entire orange and
grapefruit Industry of Florida.
"Georgia recalls llsolf what a serious
menace there was . but comparatively
a few years hack in the attack
of the Ban Jose scale upon its peach
crop. Diligent and expert InvestigaI
Hon and tests of fungicides developed
I methods by which that pest is now
iheld in check, and Its cfTect wholly
minimised.
"But It Is said the recently developed
citrus canker Is far a more serious
menace to the famous Florida
fruits than the San Jose scale ever
was to the peacn in tne days or its nrst
discovery. There apepnrs to be, as
yet, no. known economlo remedy for
the canker, which originated in Korea
and was introduced to this country in
1911; and the belief of experts is expressed
that unless some means is
found of checking, if not exterminating,
this fruit disease, within another
decade the Florida grapefruit will be
a thing of the past.
"It is posslbio now to check and
minimise and perhaps to'eradicate the
disease altogether, hut the expense
I will he considerable. For this purpose
! Florida committees and those from
other citrus fruit sections which have
been similarly attacked are 'asking
Congress for an appropriation of
H.000.000, to be expended through the
department of agriculture in the effort
entirely to eliminate the disease.
According to the report of expert entomologists
who have investigated the
situation, the attainment ot this result
Is worth almost any expenditure
that might be made upon it
"Indicative of what may be expected.
it Is pointed out that Florida has
! destroyed 2,133,000 nursery trees and
