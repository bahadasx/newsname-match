COMMANOER OF SUBMARINE IS
PUNISHED FOR FAILURE TO
NOTICE PANIC.
VESSEL BADLY HAKCIED
CONCkOING OF PRINCIPAL DE
MAND REGARDED AS DISA
VOWAL OF ACT.
IVmhib NruiiMr I ! .brH.
Vathtngton. Dec. 31. Danger of a
break in diplomatic- relations be
tween the United States and Austria
Hungary over the sinking of the liner
Auron.i probably has been cleared
away, il the official text of Austria's
reply tt the second American note
conforms to press dispatches from
London saying the communication an
nounces that the submariue .com
mander who torpedoed the sie&mer
has been punished.
The cabled press translation of the
note reached. Washington last night,
too lale to be seen by high officials
of the government, and a dispatch re
ceived earlier' Itt tbe day from Am
bassador Penfield merely said the re,
ply bad been handed bim and gave no
intimation as to Its nature.
PunUhment of the aubniarine com
mander for failure to take Into ac
count the panic prevailing aboard the
Ancoua before torpedoing the vessel
apparently meets tbe principal Ameri
can demand. In effect It might be
regarded as a disavowal of the act
and assurances that an Incident for
which an officer of the navy was pun
ished would not happen atialn might
be taken for granted.
The remaining demand, that repara
tion by payment of Indemnity be
made for the injury or losa of life by
Americans would be a subject for
diplomatic adjustment once the other
points at issue were disposed of.
The official text of the new note
from ieiuia is expected at the State
Department today.
The unofficial text of the note as
fiW-wa-'iUl l,u. Jlnnt".' T'.l"rui
Company by way of Amsterdam,
says:
"In reply to Ihe second American
Anion. i note the Austro Hunuarlan
government fully agrees with the
Wush.ngton Cabinet that the sacred
laws of humanity should be taken
into account also in war and empha
sizes list it, in the-course of Ibis
war, bus given numerous proofs of
the most humane feelings. The Aus
troiluiirariun government, too, run
positively concur In the principle that
enemy private vessels so far as they
do not fly or offer resistance shall
not be destroyed before the persons
aboard are secured. The assurance
that the Uulted Slates government at
taches value to the maintenance of
the existing good relations between
Austro Hungary and the Uulted
States is warmly reciprocated by
the Austro Hungarian Government,
which now. as heretofore, is anxious
to render these relations still more
cordial."
