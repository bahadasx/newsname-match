the decorations of the church and the t
scene was truly a very beautiful one. r
An old English garden having a large r
arched gateway covered with smilax f
from which was suspended a large
white bell showered with numerous to
small bells. The Rev. R. C. Boulware I
took his position just opposite the to
white railing which surrounded a J
beautiful pyramid of potted plants r
lighted with tall candelabra. To the v
left a summer house covered wrth to
trailing vines and lighted with many
white candles while a beautiful green 3
' hedge circled the entire garden; to the v
right ferns, smilax and narcissus in c
the glitter of innumerable lights lent a n
charm to the beautiful musical prograMiss

Macbeth Young read the complrflM^ V* .
md in it a number of points were preented.
J. Gordon Hughes, representng
the dispensary board, read the
inswer.
The complaint, among other quesions,
enumerated that the dispensary
ioard had ceased to exist, their comnission
having expired; the dispenary
profits due the city of Union for
915 had not been paid; the goods on
land, without any authorized agent
f the State was a menace to the
afety of the State and invited lawessness;
that the profits of the city of
Jnion, and also for the county and
chools, had been allowed to accumuate
in stock, fixtures and other proprty,
all the accounts having been
aid, the assets should be turned over
o the real owners, and by them disiosed
of as best they could.
J. Gordon Hughes read the answer ;
o the complaint, and denied all and
very allegation that asserted the disiensary
was without any authorized
iead; the board, under the law, was
he proper custodian; common sense
/ould teach that they could not close
he dispensary on Dec. 31 and on the
ame day close out its affairs. There
/as no need of a receiver; the books
ad been recrularlv audited? rennrto
ad been filed with proper county ofcials,
and also posted conspicuously
i the city of Union. The books were
lways open to the public. No mismanagement
had been discovered or
harged; profits had been paid during
lie year 1916, amounting to over
i9,0u0; aii bills had been paid;
2,000 had been set aside to take care
f any unforeseen expense that might
et arise; the defendants are best
ualified to handle the affairs of clos- I
lg out the dispensary. The actioh.
ne against State and county, could
ot stand under the law. A number
f exhibits were included in th> a?)- ; j
wer, affidavits testifying to the good j
naracier ana tne business ability of
fie defendants. These defendants were
? P. Morgan, J. H. Parties, J. H.
lope, D. C. Flynn, J. H. Spenrs and
i. D. Arthur.
Mr. Young, in reply to the answer,
[intended that the board had paid out
1 lthe profits except $2,000 and stock
) the value of $25,000; the officers
re out of office; their bonds are no
>nger in force; but were good only so
>ng as they were in office; the city of
fnion asked for a settlement on Pec
0; got no settlement; hence ou- apeal
to Your Honor; whatever was
iwt on Dec. 31 was profits, whether
i be money, machinery, stock or fixjres,
and belongs to the city of T'n>n,
county of Union and schools of
fnion. It was the intention of the
iw makers that if prohibition carled
on Sept. 14, then the dispensary
fffcials were in duty bound to begin
