London, Jan. C (X:30 p. ni.) Or
ganized talior of droit nrltaln, sitting
in congress In London, today, decided
against the government's compulsion
bill by the overwhelming majority of
1 ,!!, 000 votes to "83,000.
Hostility to the government's tnenti-
ure was uncompromising und nooossi-
tated the resignation from the coall-j
lion ministry of nil three labor mem-1
bcrs, Arthur Henderson, William
Ilrace and George H. Roberts, holding,
respectively, the offices of president
of the hoard of education, parliamen
tary under-secietary for home affairs
and lord commissioner of the treasury,
and their resignations were announced j
during the evening.
Most Important Mooting;.
The labor congress in many ways
is the most important body of the kind
ever assembled. More than one thous-l
and delegates were present represent-!
iujr three million workers.
!
In addition to the formal vote
ugaint-t the government's compulsion
I
bill, the congress rejected by 4 to 1 a
motion pledging support to the prin-i
ciple of compulsion for single) men;i
and passed by 2 to 1 another motion)
directing the labor party to oppose;
the bill in all its stages in the housej
of commons. !
King Socialist Anthem.
Tho congress closed with' nn en
thusiastic scene, the feature, of which
was the singing of the socialist an
I hem, "Tho Rod Flag."
The delegates met in the so-called
central hall, a. large new building
erected by the Wesleyan Methodist
churches, opposite Westminster Ab
hey, and a stone's throw from the par
liament buildings.
Some sections of the audience were
Inclined to be restive during the open
ing formalities; and then there came
a succession of Impassioned orations
against compulsion, the opposition t !
which, that, at first, had been audible,
only by interjections and murmurings,
gradually hardened and there were
loud demonstrations from every
of tho hall.
No Conflict for Them.
part
One of tho early speakers,
Henry Thomas, assistant general sec
retary of the Amalgamated Society of
ltailway Servants, kindled the hearts
to fierce enthusiasm. His was an otit-nnd-
out anti-compulsion speech, ap
pealing to the trade unions "not to
pell their heritage of freedom."
A speech by Arthur iHcndornon,
president of the board of education,
came as a sedative to the passionate
feelings aroused by the earlier speak
ers. Hut his effort was insufficient to
turn the tide of opposition.
With the exception of the miners'
federation, which refused to partici
pate, owing to internal differences
with the Joint board, virtually every
trade union of importance In the coun
try was represented in the congress.
The. number of societies Voting is giv
en from one source as 40!).
Not Representative of Labor. !
Col. John Ward. M. P.. who calls'
himself an "Independent laborite," de
clared tonight in the house that the
decision of thfl labor congress could
not be regarded as actually reprebont
ing the will of the Uibor men of the
country.
"For," said he, "you must consider
the fact that certainly from one-half
to one. third of the members of 'the
