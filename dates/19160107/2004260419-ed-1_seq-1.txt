SALOONS CLOSED
AMID REVELRY
AND HURRAH
The Hnloou Close Their Doors Willi
the Old Year
The closing of saloons lu St. Hel
ens was au epoch maker In the his
tory of the city. The old year wink
ed out amid revelry and a farewell
dirge to Thomas and Jeremiah. The
"obsequies" were free from brawl or
undue disturbance but the devotees
of Gambrlnus traveled on high speed.
Some of the saloons disposed of
their stocks early lu the evening and
closed their places of business for
all lime.
Other places the supply was runn
ing very low, but tho water snlzot
was close by and as each bottle was
filled from the reserve tank and
equul amounts of wator were added
to the supply. This formula was ob
served until It passed the test on non
Intoxicant, but the tooting of 12,
from the court house tower, prevent
ed further dilution.
One of the boys to have some sport,
dressed up In female attire, and
asked fur a drink. He raised his
skirt and from a long handled stock
ing produced the necessary coin. The
barkeep said, "nothing doing." lie
waa more fortunate in another sa
loon, where he secured "Just one."
The laugh that followed Jarred the
building, as many were wise to the
stunt.
Drinking was contagious and a
numbor were "halt seas over" who
seldom Indulged In the ardent. The
boys, as a parting tribute, were
given considerable leeway by the
peace officers and few arrosts fol
lowed. Tho saloons did a land office busi
ness and the receipts were greater
than ever before realized In a single
day. The stock remaining on hand
Is trifling, although numerous cases
and kegs are stored away by others
for private use. The full force ot
the prohibition law will not dawn ot
those who "must have It" until the
present supply Is exhausted.
Tho new states In the dry column
are as follows: Oregon, Colorado,
Idaho, South Carolina, Iowa, Arkan
sas and Washington. The other dry
states are Arizona, North Dakota.
Kansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi,
Maine, West Virginia. Tennessee,
Oeorgla will be dry on May 1, and
Virginia on Nov. 1, 1916.

There are about 16,000,000 acres
of public land In Oregon, available
for entry under the homestead law
and other acts of congress. Those
unacquainted with the facts, how
over, should be remlndod that only
a portion of this Is desirable for
agricultural purposes, and that nearly-all
of this land that Is In western
Oregon Is In the foothills, mostly
covered with timber and brush, and
hard to clear. Determined and hard
working settlers will yet hew many
homes out of the forests In the back
woods places of western Oregon,
however.
More miles of railroad proporty
wore placed in receivers' hands dur
ing 1915 than ever tn the history of
the country for. one year, according
to compilations of railroad statistics
Just published by the Railway Age
Gazette, The figures also show that
