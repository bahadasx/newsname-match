OFFICIAL PAPER OF CITY AND COUNTY
VOL. LVII. NO. 20
Cresco Will Celebrate the Fourth.
That Cresco will have a grand Fourth
of July celebration this year will be
welcome news to both young and old.
Cresco never does things by halves and
the fact that 1916 is the semi-centen
nial of our beautiful city is a double
assurance that this year's celebration
will be the best ever, one long to be
remembered by those who participate.
A great many asked that Cresco cele
brate last year but the Commercial
Club members thought best to wait till
this year and then have such a grand,
glorious Fourth as would fittingly cele
brate Cresco's 60th birthday.
The Cresco Commercial Club has
voted to celebrate and they will have
full charge of the celebration. The
business and professional men of Cres
co belong to that organization so that
the united energy of Cresco's business
men will back this year's EOth anniver
sary celebration.
Plans are being made early so that
the best attractions may be secured.
There will be a great variety of amuse
ments to please old and young. Mayor
Barker will notify all the fighting na
tions of Europe, Asia and Africa that
they must not fire a shot on July 4th,
neither a musket or a 40-centimeter
gun, or Cresco will call it a breach of
neutrality. July 4th is Cresco's day
this year and the people of our beauti
ful and progressive city extend an in
vitation to one and all to help celebrate
their 50th birthday anniversary. *,*

Another "Doomed" Industry.
When the democrats undertook the
revision of the the tariff a few months
after the 1912 election there were loud
wails from the cotton mills of New En
gland that their business was doomed
to certain dustruction. The plight of
silent looms, with thousands of wage
earners out of work, was gloomily por
trayed for the country by congressional
representatives of the textile industri
es. Standpat organs pathetically dis
cussed the ruination of a great Ameri
can industry as tho it had already come
to pass.
Iu the face of these doleful out
breaks, it is of peculir interest to read
this Associated Press dispatch in the
current newspapers:
"Boston, Mass., Dec. 29.—Notices of
wage increases affecting many thous
and employes were posted today in the
cotton mills in various cities of North
er New England. The action followed
a conference of mill treasurers held in
this city at which it was agreed that
improvement in business conditions
warranted an advance to operatives.
"Cities in which were increase notices
notices were posted included Manches
ter, Nassau, Dover, Somersworth and
Salmon Falls, N. H., and Lowell and
Lawrence, Mass. While no specific
amount was named, £it is understood
here that the advance will average five
per cent for all employes receiving $10
a week or under. The number of ope
ratives affected by the inccrease is said
to be 75,000."
The New England cotton mills are
another set of tariff beneficiaries who
"hollard before they were hurt.,' Lit
•tle by little the people are learning
that 99 per cent of the outcry against
tariff revision downward is inspired
solely by the reluctance of bloated in
dustries to forego their ancient garft.
