A FRIENDS GREETING
Id like to be the sort of friend that yo
hayo been to me
Id like to bo the help that youve been
always elud to be
Id like to mean as much to you each
minute of the day
As you havo meant old friend of mine to
me alone the way
Id Uke to do the bit- things and the splen
did things for you
To brush the eray from out your ekles
and leave them only blue
Id like to say the kindly things that I so
oft have heard
And feel fliat I could rousd your soul the
way that mine youve stirred
Id like to give you back the Joy that you
have given me
Yet that were wishing you a need I hope
will never be
Id like to make you feel as rich as I
who travel on
Undaunted in the darkest house with you
to lean upon
Im wishing at this Christmas time that I
could but repay
A portion of the gladness that youve
strewn along my way
And could I have one wish this year this
only would it be -
Id like to be the sort of friend that -you
have been to me
