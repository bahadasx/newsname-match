Our New York Letter.
Kditou Independent:
Dec. 31, 1915.
Your paper finds its way to me now
every week in thia great city, and is,
aa usual, like a letter from home. I
did not use to read advertisements,
but now the legal notices come in for
their share of attention, and the little
items of Selmer and the outside sec
tions all have their value'. The names
of people and of villages once spoken
by lips now dumb forever will always
be sacred to me, and I love to know
what is going on at dear old Purdy,
Gravelhill, Ramer, Chewalla, and oth
er places, where the people were
known and loved by my parents and
kindred. -
Speaking of Chewalla reminds me
of a remarkable man with whom I be
came acquainted in ' Washington a
short time before coming here. He
was born at Chewalla and has risen
to be one of the great men in the na
tion's business. This is the Honorable
James L. Wilmeth, Chief Clerk of the
Treasury Department, who supervises
the appointment and services of more
than five thousand clerks and officers
of the government. When I saw him
at his desk in his richly appointed of
fice in the granite palace of the De
partment on Pennsylvania avenue, in
epite of the elegant surroundings
i there was something plain and home
like about bim; 'You might say that
he looked like a hardshell. Baptist
preacher done up in fine clothes, and
then, too, there was a shrewd twinkle
in his eyes which omes to those used
to great authority and wrestling with
' gigantic problems of management and
business. When I mentioned McNairy
County and Tennessee, the Chief Clerk
' dropped other business, told me to sit
down near bim,. and get Acquainted.
He left Chewalla when h yrw boy
and went to Arkansas, but the old
familiar names of the Tennessee peo
ple found a responsive chord 'in his
heart, and he said he even loved the
red gullies around Chewalla. I can
Bay that if Chewalla has the average
senae of pride, it must be proud of
' James L. Wilmeth, who is still a
man, early in the fifties, and may go
much higher yet. While I sat an.
talked with him, he had to answer
invitations " by telephone for
lunch and other appointments with
Congressmen and other important
people, but he wanted to hear about
McNairy and its people, ana was Dy
nn manna willincr for me to leave so
11 J wv"
Ha asked me where he could
DVVUl
get information about the early set
tlers of McNairy, and I told him of
General Marcus J. Wright's book on
thatsubject. He took the General's
name and address and said he would
write to him at once.
Sinct my last letter was published
the newspapers here have announced
an interesting discovery. New York
is the largest city in the world! We
have been thinking that London, Eng
land, was ahead of us a million or
two, but it appears now, from the
latest returns, that we have 132,513
more people than London. Greater
Hew York, including the Westchester
and New Jersey suburbs, holds seven
million three hundred and eighty-
three thousand, eight hundred and
sevectyone iquIi, and ft population
much greater than that of Memphis
is added to it each year. And the
newspaper" here say that there were,
during the year past, about sixty-seven
murders per hundred thousand
of population in Memphis, and less
than one-tenth that number in this
city. Memphis heads the list for vio
lent deaths during the year in this
country. Maybe when liquor is en
tirely banished from Memphis (when
will that be done?) it will be as safe
as New York to live in.
Human imagination staggers at
the thought of what would happen
to New York city if an earthquake
like that at Messina, Italy, should
strike us. Hundreds of thousands
would he killed; the subways choked
with dying people, and the giant of
fice buildings add their horror by
tumbling over everything. And then
think that in the buildings downtown
are housed, during the day, three
times as many human beings as can
find standing room on the streets, at
one time! If they had to rush out of
those buildings all at once, they would
pile up, three deep, on the streets.
This is a serious condition of affairs.
All the same, it is inspiring to see
what is going on here, and to know
that one is part, however Bmall, of
the largest popvlation among all the
cities of this planet.
But the god of this monster New
York is money. And big money, too.
One thousand dollars is a small unit
here. When I went over to the Irving
National bank to get my first govern
ment check cashed, in the Woolworth
building across the way from my of
fice, I thought it wouldn't be a bad
idea to start a modest bank account
there. Having United States govern
ment connections, Ijneeded no further
introduction to them, and they smiled
good-naturedly at me and asked how
much I wished to deposit "I believe
I will start with twenty-five dollars,"
was my reply. Yon ought to have
seen the pained look on that man's
face as he slowly said: "We never
accept any deposit of less than $300,
and unless that balance. is kept up,
we chaige you a dollar a month for
keeping your money for you." "Do
you pay any interest on depositsr
"None on checking accounts," was
the banker's reply, which closed the
interview, except that I had to smile
too. as I told him, in parting, that
this little incident would be sent to
my home paper. At the Park Row
Bank they take no less than $500,
and at the City National Bank no less
than $1000 on account.
People come here to get nd of
their money, and there is no end to
this city's accommodation in that re
spect. Last night, at the famous res
taurant of Rectors, on Broadway, a
young chap came in with two young
girls, and called for the highest
nric.ed drink in the house." The wait
er finally broueht them a glass each
of some sort of many-colored liquid,
like mixed drinks. It was so good that
they ordered another helping of it.
The bill was twelve dollars for the six
.mull classes of liquor. Then the
voune fool pulled out a five dollar bil
and tossed it to the waiter for a tip.
And down oa the East Side of the
city in some houses there were twelve
people in one room, ana sot
a dollar
among the whole bunch to keep tbjra
from freezing and starving,
Tha East Side of New York! Here
are the "submerged millions" you
read about. More Jews than in all
Palestine, and more Italians than in
any Italian - city; Poles, Russians,
Slavs, Croatians, Bohemians, Hungar
ians, Turks, Finns, Esthonians, Mord
vins, Letts, Lithuanians, Hindoos,
Serviaus, ; Montenegrins, and a lot of
other human races the very names of
whom are strange, each with a differ
ent tongue and character. There
seemed to be no fdwer than one hun
dred thousand Jews on Grand street
alone, one evening when I went down
thereto buy Russian books. They
were peaceable enough; far different
from the Italians who were swarming
in other streets and among whom
there were six people shot and knifed
that very evening in one fight. But
at the first sign of trouble the Jews
rally together like wild animals. Let
one of them run out and cry: "Da ist
Gewalt!" (there is violence, or force!)
and a howling mob will form in an in
stant. A policeman there told me
some interesting things about these
Jews. He says they rarely go beyond
giving one a good beating or tongue
lashing, but that their curses are
fearful and wonderful. Among the
worst imprecations are when , they
wish that your father and mother
may die suddenly, or that you may
fall deathly sick and be carried con
stantly from one bed to another.
Down on Second Avenue are the Wat-er-Polacks
(one of that breed killed
President McKinley.) They are great
drunkards, and often there are terri
ble fights in the bar-rooms. The of
ficer told me of one fight in which a
man broke a beer bottle over the back
of a chair and with the jagged half of
the bottle in his hand the Polack
gouged gobs of flesh out of the man's
neck till he fell dead.
The Jews had a big mass-meeting
here once and passed a resolution to
the effect that "America is not a
Christian country." And last Satur
day one of the leading rabbis preach
ed a sermon in which he declared
that "Christmas Is a celebration bor
rowed from the "heathens, of which
we should be ashamed." In epite of
all this, the Jews and Christians
get along here finely. Tbey are found
(that is, the Jews) among the richest
and most intelligent of this city, many
of them noble and charitable people.
You do not find them in the poor
houses and not many of them in jails,
in comparsion with other races. There
are a full million of them here, and
one is never out of sight of them. I
have bad good experiences with them
as to honesty and truthfullness.
Well, this letter has about reached
its limit, but I must turn once more
to my beloved music, and tell of the
last concert on the big organ at the
City College. There were three se
lections I can never forget One was
a Bach fugue. What was it like? Can
you expect me to measure a mountain
with a yardstick, or draw a picture
of a thunderstorm? It sounded like
six pieces going all at once, only that
all the parts fitted in like a woven
carpet, so that there was no discord.
We will have to let it go at that
Beethoven's symphony was far more
easily understood. There was a theme
like i thread of gold, running through
that Fifth Symphony, The melody
was very simple, something like: "Sol
sol do, do, re mi, mi, Do-re-mi, mi, fa-
sol." This little air, with many vari
ations, made up that wonderful com
position, which has charmed number
less people since it was written more
than a hundred years ago, and it will
be better known and loved a century
hence than it is now. It was imitated
by the great Austrian composer,
Haydn, in a part of his "Creation,"
now sung evervwhere as a church
hymn: "Sol-sol do, do, re mi, mi, Do
do fa, fa, mi re," etc. But one of the
most impressive pieces was "The
March of the Magi," by the French
composer, Dubois. Amid a perfect
lacework of beautiful chords was one
high note, soft and clear, unchang
ing, throughout the whole piece. That
represented Star of Bethlehem shin
ing over the wise men as they march
ed toward the manger where lay the
infant Savior. This fine, long-drawn
note cetainly did match the , star
beams, and thrilled the hearer with
memories of that beautiful old story,
which, no matter bow it may be re
ceived by the cold and skeptical gen
eration about us, is still one of the
sweetest and most inspiring things
ever told: the Redeemer of humanity
coming here through the portals of a
lowly stable, in the midnight watches
of winter. My dear old mother used
to think that, as her first-born came
Into the world on a Christmas night,
he was destined to do something
great and good, but no one knows
more than he, how far he is from
that realization of her ' hopes. But
however that may be, Christmas al
ways means .more to me than my
birthday. And it certainly means
more to the world than, "a . heathen
celebration." .- '

Obituary
Early Sunday morning Dec. 5, 1915
the little town of Stantonville and its
community were deeply shocked and
saddened whon the news was given
out over the wires, Nona Howell is
dying. We knew she was sick but
did not realize her condition as being
so serious, we hoped that it ' was a
mistake and that something might
be done to revive her, but no physici
ans hand, no matter how skilled can
stay "The Hand of Death" So at 10:30
this icy hand severed the brittle cord
of life and her spirit went out to meet
the God who gave it , ,
Nona was the youngest daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. A. R. Boshart and
the wife of Dr. J. u. Howell or our
town, she had been a member of the
E. Church South, since early child
hood, she was devoted to her church
and Sunday school always being pres
ent when health and circumstances
permitted; she had a beautiful voice
for singing and seemed to delight in
assisting her father in this part es
pecially of the church worship. She
will be greatly missed there as well
as in the home. .
Yhile Nona's death has saddened
the home and almost broke the hearts
of husband, father, mother and sister,
mav they look up with faith to the
he nly father and he able to say
"Thy will be done"
Let us pray for Dr. Howell, to con
tinue on in the christian wbrk and
that he may be endued with ' power
from on high to nave more courage
and faith than ever before so as to
train little Carl and Earl who have
twice been left without a mother's
care to be useful men and also la
borers in the Master's vineyard.
After a beautiful prayer in the
home bv her beloved pastor, on Mon
day morning at 11 oclock, we follow
ed her remains to the Mt Vinson cem
etary, where Bro. Banks conducted a
very impressive funeral service, then
she was laid to re3t with Sailor hon
ors amid a large concoursu of sor
rowing friends and relatives.
