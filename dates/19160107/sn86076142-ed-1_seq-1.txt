Johnson, in a statement, scored the
proposal for a compromise measure
which the opposition suggested as a
substitute to the governor's plan to
straighten out the election law tangle.
The governor sets aside the compro

opposition originally contended for.
The assembly election committee
passed out theso with recommenda
tions "do not pass": The Lyon bill to
amend the primary law and provide
for party registration and the Burke
bill to amend existing non-partisan
registration and provide for party des
ignation. Attorney General Webb ad
vised the committee that the Lyon
bill was outside the jurisdiction of
the official call and that the Burke
bill was unconstitutional. All bills
passed the senate on second read

ed out by committees.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 7. Is the dead-

or decreasing?
This question seems to be answered
in a very conclusive manner by the
bureau of tun cmsua, in making public
some preliminary mortality statistics
for the year 1914, which indicate that
during the five years from 1909 to
1914 the number of automobiles in use
in the United States increased more
than twice as rapidly aa the number
of fatalities caused by them.
At thu close of 1909, according to
figures compiled by the Natnional Au

York City, from state registration re
ports, due allowance being made for
duplicate registrations, the number of
automobiles in use in the United
