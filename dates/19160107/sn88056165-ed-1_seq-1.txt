Ajri u'tural Extension Depart
ment of State University

Farmers institutes are held for

the state university is sending

achieve better results in their
farming and stock raising. Ev

of great value to them when they
start out for themselves a few
years hence.

State Owns Rich Lands
In Clearwater County
Medicinal properties said to be
found in state lands of Clear
water county will be thoroughly
tested and if practicable placed
on the market through the terms
of a lease granted Wednesday to
the Kernrex Medical company of
Walla Walla, Wash., by the state
land board. The lands, accord
ing to the report of State Mine
Inspector Bell, are rich in cer
tain medical properties, and the
company intends to use the med
icated portions of the lands for
preparations to be placed on the
market. The permit is for five
years at $25 per acre and this
low rental is made jn order that
the lands may be developed,
thereby testing the medicinal
values of the earth.
According to the report of
Mining Inspector Bell the medi
cal properties in the lands are of
about the same formation and
have the same medical value as
antiphlogistine which, according
to the report, is in some ways
similar to Fuller's earth. Forty
eight acres are covered by the
lease. The board heartily ap
proved of the report submitted
by Mining Inspector Bell, and it
was considered complete in every
detail.
The Idaho Asbestos company,
lessees of certain asbestos tracts
in Clearwater county, was grant
ed an amendment in its mineral
lease, by which the state will
permit the company to construct
and operate a plant outside of
Idaho. In the original contract
th jre was a clause to the effect
that, should the company con
struct a plant, it must be jnside
the state. It was further pro
vided that the royalty to be paid
into the state by the company
must not be less than $100 per
year.
An application from the Bank
of Kamiah for a lease of about
800 acres of land adjacent to that
held by the Idaho Asbestos com
pany was turned down. The ap
plication asked that the lease, if
granted, be for 25 years.
Forty-two farm loans, aggre
gating more than $95,000, were
granted. To be exact, the
amount of the loans was $95,550.
Many of Ihe applications were
granted for the amounts asked,
while others were considerably
cut down.
An order was made dieting
the payment by the state of de
linquent taxes on the two Lough
ran loans at PocateUfr and the
attorney general was ordered to
institute foreclosure proceedings
at once.—Boise Statesman.
A Treat Is Coming
The ladies of the library club
have secured the Hahn Jubilee
Singers for a return engagement
it this place on January 20th
and the local public can rest as
mred of listening to some of the
best vocal music on the road
when these artists appear. The
Hahn singers are equal, if not
luperior, to any colored singers
jn the road and are among the
best in the entire country. They
will appear at the K. of C. halt
jn the evening of Jan. 20th and
should be greeted by a packed
house.
Felix Martzen made a business
trip to Winon^jJj|is morning.
About two inches of snow fell
last night and will help the sleigh
roads greatly.
W. A. Jones and Will Platt, ol
the Boles section, received a fine
bunch of young Hereford bulls
at Grangeville late last week, tht
animals having been shipped in
by them from the east for use in
breeding up their range herds
across the river.
SALOONS PASS
OUT QUIETLY
Change From Wet to Dry is
Made Without Noticeable
Effort—Saloon Men Unde
cided as to Future.
Contrary to expectations the
year 1915 and John Barleycorn
passed simultaneously into histo
ry here Saturday night at mid
night and their going hardly
caused a ripple on the surface.
In spite of the fact that this is a
"wet" community and that a
large majority of our people do
not approve of the "dry" laws
enacted by the last legislature,
no acts of hostility were indulg
ed in and during the evening the
diminished stocks of the local
saloons were consumed to
such an extent that when the
closing hour rolled around there
was nothing left to sieze and
confiscate.
Quite a number of visitors
from reservation points came in
on the evening train to assist
at the final obsequies but their
inclinations ran more to music
than to war and it was not nec
essary for the peace officer to
make a single arrest.
Three saloons were put out of
commission here by the dry
laws, they having been operated
by S. J. Peterson, John Funke
and R. A. Nims. Mr. Funke re
opened his place Monday and is
carrying a stock of cigars and
soft drinks and has provided
card tables for his patrons.
Mr. Nims is operating his pool
hall, while Mr. Peterson will
take an extended vacation be
fore deciding just what he will
turn his hand to in future.
By the closing of the saloons
the village and public school has
lost a direct revenue of about
$2500 per year which will have
to be replaced by increased tax
ation on the property within the
village and school district boun
daries.
In the meantime the public
will watch the operation of the
new prohibition laws with inter
est and hope they will prove
nore effective than those of the
local option regime.
The lack of part of our regular
help this week and a ruqh of
work makes the first issue of the
new year slightly below pij£

The basket ball game last Fri
day night resulted in a victory
for the Nezperce team by a
score of 62 to 11. The game was
not so one-sided, however, when
you consider that the visiting
team had won games from Lew
iston, as well as Spokane, and is
considered the fastest team in
this part of the state. Watch us
change the score Friday night in
our game with Ferdinand.

Friend Frank:
I enclose you here
with $2.50 for subscription to the
Chronicle, my weekly visitor
from my old home, and one very
much appreciated. I must com
pliment you on the Holiday num
ber, the finest of any paper that
has come to my hand as yet.
We have had a very cool, rainy
summer, too much so for corn,
but all right for small grain.
Lots of corn did not mature well,
but small grain was an excep
tionally heavy crop, but the har
vest weather was very rainy and
some of the grain suffered after
it was in the shock. Our Xmas
weather is ideal, snow on the
ground, moderate temperature,
(right around freezing), and ev
erybody out to enjoy themselves.
There is considerable grippe in
evidence, sometimes very malig
nant, but generally not very bad,
and people not losing much time
with it.
Best holiday wishes to all.
Resp'y. Yours,
H. W. Tefft.
