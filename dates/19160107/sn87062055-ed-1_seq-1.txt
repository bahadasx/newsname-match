FLAGSTAFF'S SPLENDID
SHUNGJOR PAST YEAR
Flagstaff opens the new year facing
the greatest period of prosperity irt
its history.
No city of its size in Arizona has
undergone more improvements than
Flagstaff in the year just ended, and
further great improvements are con
templated. At the present time several large
buildings are in course of counstruc
tion, amoung which is the big Babbitt
three-story block costing $60,000, oiu
which finishing touches are being ap
plied. This building, which is one of
the most imposing in the state and
undoubtedly the largest garage in the
southwest, is situated at the south
west corner of San Francisco and
Birch streets opposite the Coconino
county courthouse.
The Lowell Observatory is putting
up a combined laboratory office and
workshop building on Observatory
hill at a cost of about $40,000. It is
to be of concrete and stene.
A new $43,000 girls dormitory and
$8,900 annex to the boys dormitory
are being erected at the Northern
Arizona Normal shool under the
supervision of E. T. McGonigle, who
is well known in Phoenix. Rapid
progress is being made on these struc
tures, the girls building to bo done in
April and the later almost completed
now. The girls dorm is to be of red
sandstone with concrete floors and is
to have two stories with a total of 42
rooms. The boys building is also to
be of brick and will take care of 20
more boys.
Frank Brooks, general merchandise
dealer has recently completed erecting
a store building and additions costing
approximately $12,000.
Both the Elks and Masonic lodges
plan to erect magnificent new homes
this year and there is talk of a new
postoflice building.
Lots of new homes, several on the
bungalow style, were erected during
1914 and more than a dozen are in
course of construction at the present
time.
It is reported that the Harvey
v House people are planning an eating
house for Flagstaff; and also that
William Randolph Hearst, the well
kntjwn newspaperman, is arranging to
build a 60-room lodge at Grand View
on the Grand Canyon near here,
which he purchased a short time ago.
It is the intention to pave about 15
blocks of Flagstaff streets in the
spring. Eleven miles of sidewalks,
have been laid and within about eight
months it is thought there will not be
a board Avalk in the city. An orna
mental street lighting system is be
ing installed now.
J. W. Wcatherford, who is now in
Phoenix, has obtained a government
permit for the construction of a boulc
.vard through the Coconino National
Forest, to the top of the San Fran
cisco Peaks, which are 12,611 feet
high. It is planned to put a huge
telescope on the top of the peaks
from which point one may 'look into
six states: Arizona, New Mexico, Ne
vada, Colorado, California and Utah.
A 53,000,000 gallon reservoir was
recently completed and another is
contemplated.
A company is developing water
back of San Francisco pea"ks. It will
be stored in several natural reser
voirs in extinct craters and will be
used for stock purposes and farming
and it is figured to pipe it to the
Grand Canyon for the Santa Fe's use
at that point. At the present time
the Santa Fe is paying, it is said, ap
proximately $100,000 yearly for
water hauled in cars from Flagstaff.
It is estimated that the new water
development plan will cost between
throe and SMtO.OOO.
Mining i? looking up in Coconino
county. The Tusayan Copper com
pany which is interested down In the
. Grand Canyon near the Little Colo
rado river, has over a million tons of
ore in sight above the bed of the
river. All government permits have
been obtained.
J. T. Burns has been operating his
onjx mine near here until the severe
weather set in.
Flagstaff has a now motor fire
apparatus.
A move is on foot to have the
county of Coconino vote a $350,000
bond issue for good roads.
There is a wonderful outlook for
the livestock and lumber industries
this year. Phoenix Gazette.
The above is a fairly good resume
of the steady growth of Flagstaff dur
ing the past year, and when we realize-in
a general way, is a summary
of our progress during 1915 is sur
prising, even though next year pro
mises more and greater improvements.

WINSLOW BOYS NEAR
DEATH IN BIG STORM
Five young boys between fif
teen and sixteen years of age
came near freezing to death in
the big snow storm last week.
They had gone on their bicycles
twelve miles out of Winslow on
a rabbit hunt, leaving Thursday
expecting to be gone a couple
days. The storm struck them
and they were unable to make
their way back home. Saturday
a searching party found them
with their feet badly frozen and
completely out of food. First re
ports said their feet were so
badly frozen that amputation
would be necessary, but later it
was reported while their feet
were badly frost bitten no serious
results were anticipated from the
venture. The boys were Bert
Sutton's son, Joe Crosier and two
Drum boys, the name of the fifth
we were unable to learn.
Mrs. George Black Sr. Passes
Mrs. George W. Black Sr. passed
away at her home qt 815 south Har
vard Boulevard, Los Angeles, on Sun
day January 2nd 1916 at 11 o'clock a.
m. after several weeks of severe ill
ness of heart trouble.
Mrs. Black was one of the early re
sidents of Flagstaff. She was a do
votcd wife and a loving mother, whose
span of 58 ycar3 were filled with lov
ing kindness and thoughfulness for
those about her rather than for her
self. Her home for many years was in
Flagstaff where most of her loved
ones dwelt, until a change of climate
was made necessary by heart trouble.
A few short years ago she consented
to live in Los Angeles, but her heart
was in the pine clad hills surrounding
Flagstaff where the happiest years of
her most useful life were spent
For a time she seemingly improved,
but the loved ones had little hope of
her ultimate recovery and Sunday she
passed peacefully away with her loved
ones around her.
The funeral services were held in
Los Angeles Tuesday at 1 p. m. and
she was buried in Los Angeles owing
to the practically impossibility of
bringing her here for burial. Mrs.
Black leaves a husband, four sons and
a daughter to mourn for their loved
one.
There is deep sorrow in the hearts
of many in Flagstaff for the dear
friend laid to eternal rest, and an
abiding sympathy for those who are
left in grief at the parting.
COMMISSIONER ALLEN
IS MAIN APPOINTED
F. O. Allen was re-appointed county
immigration commissioner for Coco
nino county last week by the board of
supervsors, in recognition of the good
work he did during his past term of
office.
Commissioner Allen is enthusiastic
in his work of bringing the many ad
vantages of Coconno county to the
attention of the public at large and
has endeavored to so diversify it that
all portions of the county and all pro
ducts secure a fair proportion of pub
licity. His exhibits at the different
fars have been a welcome surprise to
many residents of the county who had
no idea of the variety of produce or
the productiveness of the many rich
valleys and parks now covered with
homesteads.
Ho intends making a greater effort
this year and with the co-operation of
the people of the county hopes to
make a vastly better showing the
coming year than he did last year.
Locksley J. Gray Dear"
Locksley J. Gray, a young man
about 27 years of age, died Saturday
night of appendicitis after a few flays
illness. Ho leaves a wife and baby
who were dependent upon him for
support.
Mr. Gray lived a good many years
in Williams, coming there when the
Postal telegraph office was first estab
lished at that place, his father having
charge as operator. He afterwards
moved to Texas where he was mar
ried. He came to Flagstaff last May
and worked as cxpresman for David
Lewis, and afterwards for Smith &
Lovell. A short time ago he started
in the express business for himself
and was doing well when seized with
fatal illness.
The funeral services were held
Tuesday and the remains buried be
side those of his mother in Williams.
His father is still living somewhere in
old Mexico, but relatives were unable
to reach him.
LADY LEGALLY ADOPTS
HER VERYJWN DAUGHTER
Peculiar things happen in the real,
every day life and none could be more
so that a mother legally adopting her
own daughter, as occurred in the Su
perior court last week, strange as the
proceding may seem. It was an illu
stration of the uncertainty of the for
tunes of life and the sacrifice of
mother's love for her child.
About thirteen years ago Mrs. Bond
then a widow with three children
living in Colorado was in rather
straightened circumstances and a
young couple named Smith, having
recently marred, wished to adopt the
little girl then three years old. Mrs.
Bond consented to the adoption and
the little girl grew to the age of six
teen in her adopted home. She re
cently visited her mother now, Mrs.
Gus Reimcr at Williams. Mother love
was still strong and Mrs. Reimer
asked to adopt her own daughter. The
Smith family, having three children of
their own and not as well off finan
cially as Mrs. Reimer, consented to
the return of the young lady to her
own mother. Attorney F. M. Gold of
Williams, arranged the proceedings
and the order for adoption was made
by Judge Perkins last Friday morning
and now the young lady's name, hav
ing been Bond and Smith, is now le
gally Miss Nellie Marie Reimer, and
is happily living in her new home.
A Brakeman Is Charmed
C. L. Bnyno, the brakeman who
usually uses No. 9 going west and
some other train east on his way back
from Needles, in order to keep his
name on the pay roll, is exhibiting a
gold watch charm presented to him
by the O. R. T. at Winslow the first
of the year as a token of esteem and
for meritorious service as secretary of
that order during the past year.
While his chest measure has increased
considerably in order that the charm
may show plainer, he has not laid in
a supply of larger hats and caps he
was just humanly pleased with the
memento of good will.

WANTS T. E. POLLOCK
FOR NEXT GOVERNOR
If the republicans of Arizona want
a live, progressive business man as
their candidate for governor, we would
suggest they go to Flagstaff, and look
over T. E. Pollock. He is of the
sturdy oak, who -would bring brains
and ability to the gubernatorial chair,
and Arizona would soon realize that
a business head was in control. But
if the politicians want a basswood
stick, whom they can control as a
puppet to do their every bidding, Mr.
Pollock is not the right timber. The
people are more interested in good
government than in the distribution
of spoils to political mercenaries.

HANDED HEAVY PENALTY
FOR INTRODUCING LIQUOR
Jack Chandler, charged with having
illegally introduced liquor into the
state was tried in the superior court
Tuesday and was found guilty on the
charge brought against him. Chan
dler refused to give his consent to the
destruction of the liquor in question,
which it seems is necessary under the
existing law as the officials have no
authority to destroy it without the
consent of the owner. Judge Perkins
imposed a sentence of ninety days in
the county jail and a fine of $300. In
default of payment, the prisoner will
have to serve out his fine in the coun
ty jail at the rate of $2.00 per day.
WILLIS .AZBELL
OVERJTROUT BAIL
Willis Azbell, arrested on the
charge of having murdered Henry
Thomas or being implicated in the
murder, was taken to Williams Mon
day by Sheriff Dickinson for a pre
liminary hearing before Justice F. O.
Twitty. County Attorney C. B. Wil
son was present to present the case
against him.
Very little new evidence was intro
duced at the trial and Azbell was held
without bail, for trial in the Superior
Court, and brought back to Flagstaff
Monday.
Henry Azbill Held Without Bail
Henry Azbill, a brother of Willis
Azbill, arrested last week near Wen
den charged with the murder of Hen
ry Thomas along with his brother,
was taken to Williams Wednesday for
a preliminary hearing before Judge
F. O. Twitty. Account-differ as to
whether he went on the stand in his
own behalf or not, but in any event
he had no attorney and the evidence
produced was sufficient in the mind of
Judge Twitty to hold him over with
out bail for trial in the superior court.
Married at Truxton
Miss Minta Mathis, a sister of Mrs.
Moyer of this city, was married at the
Truxton Indian school on New Years
day to Mr. J. Arthur Disbrow. Miss
Mathis made her home in Flagstaff
for a number of years and is well
known here. Mr. Disbrow is a car
penter in the Indian service. They will
make their home at Truxton.
Warm Rain Looked Serious
There was a start for a good rain
storm Wednesday night and a light
rain fell for a short time and later
turned to snow which lasted only a
short time. It was warm and the
skies well clouded over and. the pros
pect of a rain on top of the big snow
storm was viewed with alarm for a
time, as a rain just then would have
resulted in a large, prosperous flood of
water looking for a way out. It con
tinues warm with progonostications
of more storm.
WARDEN SIMS WANTS
TO VARIFYJIS RECORDS
Warden Sims, of the state prison, is
much worked up for fear the Coconino
Sun has attempted to palm off a man
by the name of Strahan on him as a
paroled prisoner, denies that any per
son by the name of Strahan was ever
in that prison and asks Sheriff Dickin
son for information. In the article
relative to the murder of Henry
Thomas whose body was found in the
J. D. dam, we mentioned the fact that
the young man "made his head
quarters with Peter Strahan who be
friended him and later made the
acquaintance of the paroled prisoner."
No mention was made of the paroled
prisoners name. While we are willing
to admit the statement could have
been made clearer, no one in this sec
tion of the country and no one to our
knowledge has heretofore put such a
construction on the article. It was
left to Warden Sim's accumen to
come to such a conclusion.
If, however, Warden Sism wishes
to actually know the facts in the case,
he might turn over his book to the
A's and see if he can't find the name
of Henry Azbill on the list. He is
one of the men now held charged with
the murder of Henry Thomas, and his
brother Willis Azbill, the other. The
sheriff's office has a very good picture
and description of Henry Azbill from
the Warden's office.
We apologize to Peter Strahan for
Warden Sims and agree that Mr.
Strahan was never in any way con
nected with Mr. Sim's institution for
the prevention of punishment of per
verts. Large- Damage Suit Now On
One of the largest personal injury
suits ever instituted in this county
was begun in Judge Lyman's division
of the Superior court yesterday, C. D.
Young suing DanicL Campbell, D. M.
Francis and Hugh Campbell for $31,
500 damages.
The suit is the outcome of an ac
cident which occurred November 24,
1914. Daniel Campbell was driving
an automobile and Mr. Young was on
a motorcycle, the collision taking
place on Third avenue and Adams
street Colin Campbell, Eugene Camp
bell and Joe Connelly, who will prob
ably be called as witnesses. Mr.
Young, who was formerly secretary
of the Arizona Alfalfa Mill company
was seriously injured. Phoenix Republican.

fire bugs attempt to
burn McMillan hall
A fire alarm was turned in
v Monday morning at about 2 "
o'clock for a blaze that started
I under the stair way leading to
the upper floor of the McMillan
5 building. The fire had been
smoldering for sometime when
the smoke awakened roomers up
stairs. The incipient blaze was
put out in a short time by
hand grenades rom the big fire
truck.
There is a narrow hallway
alongside of the stairs, which
leads into the main hall now used
by Costigan & Smith for their
picture shows since the wreck of
the Majestic theatre building.
The door was locked at night
after the show and about 9,000
feet of picture films were placed
outside the door for the express-
man in the morning.
It was evident that there was
a incendiary about for this door
was found unlocked and a five
gallon can of oil taken from the !
' property room and placed in the '
hallway along side the films.
In a short time the oil and films
would have made a flath of
flames cutting off all means of
escape for the people on the se-
cond floor except by jumping
! from the windows.
It was a fiendish attempt at
destruction and probable murder
and it is difficult to imagine who
could have attempted the cold
blooded deed.
As it was no great amount of
damage was done, but a few mo-
ments more, when the flames
reached the big batch of films
and there would have been a "
disastrous explosion and fire.

Arrested for Grand Larceny
E. S. Price was arrested at Wil
Hams last week by the sheriff's office
and is being held awaiting the arrival
of the sheriff of Live Oaks, Florida.
Price is charged with grand larceny
and will be taken back to Florida for
trial. Price is a young man about 26
years old and is married. His wife
was with him when the. arrest was
made.
Freed and Rearrested
Wednesday morning habeas corpus
proceedings were brought by Attorney
Hempcrley to free Price and on hear
ing the case, Judge Perkins turned
Price lose. He was arrested again
immediately on charge of having
issued worthless checks and returned
to jail.
KERMEEH WILL HANG
BOARD REFUSES PARDON
At a meeting of the board of par
dons and paroles Monday it was de
cided not to interfere in the case of
W. W. Kermeen, who is under sen
tence to be hanged next Friday. Con
siderable pressure has been brought
to bear upon the board to take action
in behalf of Kermeen on the theory
that he is insane. But this pressure
comes solely from the element which
would find a reason for the commuta
tion of the sentence of every man who
is under sentence of death.
Members of the board stated that
they had no reason to believe that
Kermeen is not sane. More than a
month ago the board, on the represen
tation of those who had observed Ker
meen, recommended a reprieve for
him that his case might be brought
before a jury in Pinal county. No ac
tion was taken at that time, ard again
the board suggested a reprieve, which
was granted. Then the case was
brought before the court and a jury
about a month ago. The jury decided
that Kermeen was not insane. The
board finds itself unable to go back
of that verdict Phoenix Gazette.
He's Some Politician
Harry Hibben accompanied by Mr.
Fletcher Bly, mayor of Anita, paid a
business visit to Williams today.
Williams News.
The same Fletcher Bly claims to
be mayor of Bellemont He resigned
there last fall and turned the job over
to W. J. Kaup, then goes to Anita
and forceably ousts the mayor there
and takes his job away from him.
At last reports the state game
warden was on ihs trail for running
down jackrabbits and throwing them
in with his bands of sheep. He seems
to be all on the wing either running
for office or jackrabbits and if some
old ewe don't bite him some day he'll
have all the small towns, except Har
vey house towns, corralled.

AFTERMATH Ur'rLAGSFIFF'S
HISTOIIICAIJNOW STORM
The local U. S. weather report for
January 1st says that sixty-one. inches
of snow fell in the preceeding twenty
four hours.
In spite of the damage it did, it
might have been a whole lot worse.
Few residents ever saw a heavier
snow fall during one storm in this
section of the country, though old
timers say there was a similar down
fall of the pure white some thirty
or thirty-five years ago.
Streets were practically blockaded
for a time. Pedcstrains and delivery
teams were a scarcity, few, went out
unless compelled to, and business men
kept shovelers going all day Friday
and most of the day of Saturday. The
streets were broken by means of four
horse teams with drags. The first
time around was a very slow process,
but by Sunday, going in the main sec
tion of town was fairly good, though
it looked as though every one had
suddenly took on the war fever and
intrenched himself. About all you
could sec were the heads of people
bobbing up and down along behind
the snow embankments.
Dispite the few hours discomfort
and anxiety for heavily ladened roofs,
it was a beautiful scene and hundreds
of photographs were taken by real
photographers and snap-shotters, to
be retained as souvenirs of the great
snow storm of 1915-1916.
So far as could be learned the snow
was of great value to the stockmen of
the north, and no stock were lost in
the storm. A few head of drifting
stock may have been caugh't here and
there too high up on the mountain, but
the loss could not ordinarily be very
great
The days the first of the week were
warm and the snow, being heavy,
started melting and the big heaps
gradually sunk to a reasonable level,
though many streets will have to be
cleared of snow by hauling it away.
Dance Hall Also Caes In
A Mexican movie show and dance
hall on the .south side that was built
last summer caved in last week Fri
day, while the general wreck was
going on. It was a cheaply construct
ed frame building, insufficiently
braced on the inside. No one was in
jured in the smash.
F. L. M. Cac in Did Little Damage
The loss of the F L. M. Co. by rea
son of cave in of roofs was not as
great as at first reported. The box
factory roof was not injured but the
cave ins occurred in the dry sheds
and then only a partial collapse oc
curred. The buildings that were
weakest were cleared of snow by
means of a hose and fire pumps, but a
part of the buildings dropped in be
fore it could be reached by the hose.
Flagstaff's Oldest Building Falls
The oldest building in Flagstaff
gave way Monday to the heavy w eight
of snow and fell a crumbled ruin. It
was the old ice house on the south
side, in the rear of the iron building
used by Babbitt Bros, for storage of
hides.
According to Sandy Donohuc, the
building was tuilt away back in the
early 80's by the Al Cattle company .
as a sort of headquarters. During late
years it was used as an ice house by
Sandy and later abandoned entirely.
Lost in the Snow Storm
Night Watchman Elliott at F. L. M.
camp 1, came near losing himself for
good in the heavy snowstorm last Fri
day night. He started out for town
on horseback in the afternoon and
was unable to make his way through.
He turned his horse lose and made
his way back to the steam loader on
the track where he passed the night
Twenty men from the camps started
out to find him, finally getting him
back to the logging camp at about 3
o'clock New Years day. The snow in
that section of the country is even
deeper than in Flagstaff, though the
logging road has been kept open.
ASSESSORS REDUCE
SHEEP VALUATION
With the exception of sheep, all
minimum valuations on livestock are
the same for the 1916 assessment as
they were for the 1915.
Such is the result of the annual
conference of the county assessors of
Arizona with the state tax commission
which ended at 1:30 o'clock Wednes
day. The new minimum valuation on
sheep was fixed at $3.50 per head.
Last year it was $4 which was the fig
ure placed by the state board of equa-1
ization.
