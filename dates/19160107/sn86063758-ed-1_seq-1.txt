Committee.
(Signs are not wanting that there
soon will take place in the United
States congress sharp debates on the
position of the United States as a result
of the European war. Already in
the senate there nas been some debate
concerning American neutrality, shipment
of munitions of war and travel
.by American citizens on ships of belligerent
nations, showing divergent
views by various senators which the
presiding officer permitted "by way of
feeling out and getting an index to

In the hands of the foreign relations
committee of the senate now rest data
.sent it by Secretary Lansing concerning
Great Britain's holding up of neutral
commerce, and t'ne negotiations
with Germany concerning that country's
submarine warfare. What is
"known officially concerning the sinking
of the steamer Persia is also said
to have been handed over to the committee.

OUR UNRULY SUN.
It Seems to Be Trying to Dilate to the
Bursting Point.
The French astronomer Puiseux has
been busying himself with the consti
tution of tiie sun. He finds that, in
stead of condensing and shrinking lit
tie by little, as was formerly supposed,
the sun is constantly dilating more and
more and reaching the point of bursting.
And if the sun blew up there
would be no more need for us poolmortals
to worry about worldly af
l fairs. *
r Big suns every whit as important in
their own constellations as ours are
frequently victims of an explosion
"There was one in the constellation of
Perseus early in 1901. and since then
two at least have occurred in other
celestial groups.
k Observation has shown long since
that the great orb which is our all in
all is a most uncertain character. Sun
: spots, fire blasts and such liko phe
^ rnomena are by no means the most of 1
ho Ics ponnhlA. Tht* mannpr ?r? I
which the sun throws off atomic ener
a gy and transforms the heavy into light
elements, hydrogen, helium, nebulium.
.archonium and what not spells nothing
* good for this world, and a mere notb
ing might lead to a disaster any day.
In short, it is bound to come at some
time or other. Unfortunately science
can give us no idea as to when. Centuries
and even hundreds of centuries
are as but a moment in the history of
. the universe, says Professor Flammak
rion, and for all we know the sun may
have millions of years more life before
4- man can te11* though, and, just
as the strongest of us are struck down
in a moment, so the all powerful plan
et may give out at any time, and when
it does it will make but short work of
all of us here below.?Boston Tranft

MAYOR OF ATLANTA
COMES OUT WINNER
i I
BALLOTING RESULTS TWO TO ONE I
AGAINST HE CALL.
Returns Indicate That Virtually a
Straight Ticket Was Voted
Wednesday.
j
Atlanta, Ga., .Jan. >.?^ompieie uu-1
official figures of today's special elec-1
tion showed majorities of approximate-!
ly two to one against the recall of
Mayor James G. i.Voodward and the
fr. e police commissioners whose recall
was sought.
Mayor Woodward, out of a total of
9,689 votes cast in his case, received a
majority of 2,900 against the recall. In j1
the balloting on the recalling of the
mayor 6.299 votes against his recall
and 3,399, slightly'more t'nan the num- ,
ber who signed the recall petition, vot- j
ed for his removal. )T'he returns indi- j
cated that virtually a straight ticket |
had been voted.
The vote on the recall of the five
I members of the police commission and
i the mayor, who I san ex-officio member,
was asked because the commission
reduced James L. Beavers from
chief of police to a captaincy. Beavers
resigned rather than accept the reduction.
His friends claimed that he did j
not have a fair trial. Beavers was ac- j
cused of not obeying the orders of the j
police board.

Curious Ancient Monument Left to Us
by the Indians.
On the broad top of a stony, rain
gullied bill in middle Georgia there I
lies a very large eagle, concerning!
which conflicting stories are told. The ;
one point that seems to be certain is !
that the Indians left the eagle as a i
legacy to the state. A hundred years j
from now it will probably be found j
lying on its back, with outspread wings j
and tail, even as it lies today. For it j
is made of quartz rocks so cunningly i
placed that it would require a pick in !
a strong man's hands to displace any j
one of them. The rocks lap and over- |
lap in such a manner as to represent |
feathers. Xo cement holds them in i
position, and the stones vary in size, j
weighing from a half pound to three
or four pounds. The image rests on a j
very firm foundation, /for the stonework
extends several feet into the
ground.
Once, perhaps twice, treasure seeking
vandals dug into the breast of the
eagle, but the work must have proved
too laborious, for the diggers gave up j
before they had reached the bottom !
layer of overlapping stones.
Rough but fairly accurate measurements
of the bird show the length of
the eagle from the middle of the tail j
to the head to be 102 feet and from j
tip to tip of outspread wings 120 feet i
The length of the beak is ten feet, j
and the height of the body at the ceu- ;
ter of the breast is ten feet The eagle j
lies with its head to the west
Tradition does not give any satisfactory
explanation of the age or the
meaning of the great stone mound. It
may have had religious significance to
the red men who built it, and it may
be the burial place of some great chief, j
It is one of the most mysterious and
most interesting of prehistoric monuments
in the United States.?Youth's

The wedding march was played
by Miss Susie Owings and the bridal
party entered in the following order:
Miss Lizzie McMillan, sister of the
bride, and Mr. Cooper of Whitmire and

The bridesmaids were attractively attired
in pink and carried bouquets of

The distinguished and well-beloved
bishop of a certain State is so absentminded
t'nat his family is always apprehensive
for his welfare when he is
away from them.
Not long ago, while making a journev
hv rail, the bishop was unable to
find his ticket when the conductor
asked for it.
"Never mind, bisnop," said the conductor,
who knew 'nim well, "I'll get it
on my second round."
However, when the conductor passed
through the car, the ticket was still
missing.
"Oh, well, bishop, it will be all right
if you never find it," the conductor assured
him.
"No, it won't, my friend," contradicted
the bishop. "I've got to find
that ticket. I. want to togiow where I'm,
going."?Youth's Companion.

I Well, here am 1 again. I didn't sufficiently
recover from the holidays to
i be able to write for the last paper.
Xow, don't misunderstand me. There
was nothing wrong. 1 only ate too
much. I had a plenty of good country
sausage and pudding and spare ribs
and backbone?and all of us need that
?and it was good, and if you ever
saw a poor creaiure who could eat pudding
and mush or hominy un.il it was

I?is that correct? Really I wonder
if' it is. My boarding house had a
plenty of it?I mean the pudding, etc.?
sent in from the country and I ate and
I ate and I am still eating. Turkey
isn't in the same class. Well, it will
all soon be gone and then I reckon
they will feed me on the meat we get
from the market, and sometimes that
is good, too. I never complain about
what they give me to eat, and I am
just as fond of good eating as any poor
creature you ever saw. Sometimes I
wonder why it is?that is, why the good
Prnviripncp <rives to those of us who
can't get the good things of life, such
a capacity for enjoying them, and
sometimes those who have the money
in abundance, such poor digestion. I
reckon it is the compensation which
runs through all nature. But I am
satisfied and happy and am glad it is
no worse with me at the beginning of.
this good new year. It might be a whole
let worse. I have a good appetite and
enjoy fairly good health and for these
things I am thankful. I never have
i-nough money to know just where the
next meal is coming from, but it has
always come and I reckon will continue.
I try to recall that saying of
the wise man and remember the birds
of the air and the fowls of tne neia
/
and I reckon I am about as well satisfiied
and contented as some of the rich
folk hereabout, because I am not worried
about losing what I've got?
because I ha\e nothing to lose
?and I try to be satisfied
and contented with my lot, and to
do my duty to my fellow man as I am
given the light to see that duty. And
then some of these folk don't seem to
me to know how to spend the money
they have made, and that is a great
virtue?to know how to spend it and
get the most out of it after you have
made it. Now, I am an adept in that
line, and I do like to share that pleasure
with my friends, and some of tnese
fellows hate to part with their money
e. en to pay an honest obligation.

J wish I could write paragraphs, but
somehow I just can't and that's all
there is to it. My paragraphs get too
long before I know it. And that reminds
me that besides tne Christmas1
card I received from the paragrapher!
on the State I received another X?w I
Year carc', or rather I should say aj
Xew Year card, which runs like this,
and I appreciate it, too, and I wish
the fellow who sent it had signed his
or her name: 'Uhe idler?This card
is to wish you a new year full of many j
blessings, and a limber pen to write!
it. I'm one that's glad you're going to ?

that's real nice and whoever this is 11
want him or her to know that it. Is!
appreciated. 1 know that there are J
just lots of 'em that read my sutff and
enjoy it, too, but they just don't think
to sit down and write me a line and
tell me they do. On the reverse side of
this card is the poem, "The Old Oaken
Bucket,'' and I'm going to quote it,
for it brings back to me memories of
the long ago, though when I lived in
the country we didn't even have the old
oaken buck, but got our water from the
old spring that lay at the foot of the
hills, and the water really and truly
came fresh and sparkling from out of
the everlasting hills, and it was fine,
you bet. I long some day to go back
to the old spring and sit on the higl
rocks and drink the water and ruminate
on the days when I sat there and
drank the water on a hot summer day
and enjoyed the cool breezes that came
over the hills, but when once you come
10 town it seems that you can never
get able to go back to the scenes of
childhood's days. And somehow there
is a longing to return to those scenes
as we grow old. But I am going to remain
young in .everything .eise so long
as I live. Bu^ am about to forget the
1 "WBBMBWHI
poem:
?o?
The Old Oaken Bucket.
How dear to this heart are the scenes
of my child'nood,
When fond recollection recalls them
to view;
The orchard, the meadow, the deeptangltd
wildwood,
And every loved spot which my infancy
knew;
The wide spreading pond, and "he mill
which stood by it,
The bridge, and the rock where the
c-ateract fell,
The cot of my father, the dairy-house
nigh it,
And e'en the rude bucket which hung
in the well.
The old oaken bucket?the iron-bound
bucket?
The moss-cover'd bucket, which hung
in the well.
tlhe moss-cover'd vessel I hailed as a
treasure,
For often, at noon, when return'd
from the field,
I found it the source of an exquisite
pleasure,
The purest and sweetest that nature
can yield;
How ardent I siezed it, with hands that J
were glowing,
And q: ck to the white-pebbled bottom
it fell,
Then soon, with the emblem of truth
overflowing,
And dripping with coolness, it rose
from the well.
The old oaken bucket?the iron-bound
bucket?
The moss-covered bucket arose from
the well.
v
How sweet from the green mossy brim
to receive it,
As poised on the curb, it inclined to
my lips;
Xot a full-blusiiing goble*. couia tempi i
me to leave it,
Though fill'd with the nectar that
Jupiter sips.
And now far removed from the loved
situation,
The tear of regret will intrustively
swell,
As fancy revisits my father's plantation,
And sighs for the bucket which hangs
in t'ne well.
| The old oaken bucket -the iron-bound
bucket?
The moss-covered bucket which hangs
in the well.
?o?
That poem recalls many ot'ner scenes
of childhood's days besides an old
oaken bucket. The old orchard and
! the old mill pond and the meadow and
?well, I do not care^to say more just
now because I am afraid my readers
will not be interested?but it is good
to let memory work sometimes and to
go back to the old scenes, for it makes
you more tender and anything in this
cold and hard business age that
arouses the tender side of our 'nature
is good once and awhile to bring up.
Byt I am going to write about some
every-day t'nings in my subsequent articles
during this good year and I am
going to try to do it tenderly and nice
and see if I can't arouse our people
to do some of the things that need to
be done in this town.

Of great interest to friends in Newberry
and other sections of South Carolina
was the marriage Wednesday
evening of Miss Sarah Strother^Pope
and (Mir. Paul E. Anderson. iThe wedding
took place at the residence of the
bride's friend, Mrs. Andrew J. S. Langford,
where she has made her home for
the past five years. It was a wedding
characterized for its beauty and simplicity,
and was witnessed only by relatives
and most intimate friends.
Decorations prevailed throughout th<*
home, introducing a color scheme of
green and white.
A beautiful improvised altar was arranged
in the large bow window of the
living 'room. This was built of tall
palms and ferns and lighted with, whit?
candles, while just over the place
where the bride and groom stood was
a large bow of white maline.
At the appointed time the Rev. E. V.
Babb, pastor of the Baptist church, entered
and took 'his placfc at the improvised
altar. Then the bride and . .<
groom entered and a most impressive
marriage service followed.
After the ceremony a salad course,
ollowed by a sweet course, was served.
The bride was attired in a beautiful
grown of robin blue crepe meteor with
coral trimmings, with all accessories
to match. The gifts were ampng the
most beautiful ever seen in Newberry,
attesting the popularity of the couple.
Mrs. Anderson is one of.the most
popular and loved young ladies of this
section, having a wide circle of friends
and relatives.. S'he is a niece of the
late 'Chief Justice Y. J. Pope. Mr. An
derson also has a host of friends and
is a very,successful merchant of Newberry,
the manager of ti.f .Anderson
