MRS. LOU SHANKS'
DEATH A SHOCK
Prominent Lincoln County Woman
Succumbs to Pneumonia After
Short Illness
The death of Mrs. Lou Shanks at
the home of her daughter Mrs. Kirby
Bourne, at New Castle, Henry coun
ty, early Thursday morning came as
a distinct and severe shock to the
many friends and loved ones of this
good woman at her home here. Mrs.
Shanks had been suffering from
"bronchial pneumonia and complica
tions for some time, but latest re
ports from her bedside were that her
condition was satisfactory and when
the message came telling of her
death, it was a great blow to all and
sincere regret was expressed on all
sides and sympathy extended to the
members of the family in their hour
of great bereavement.
Ordinarily a vigorous woman, Mrs.
Shanks had lately begun to break
with the passing of the years, and
was unable to throw off with her ac
customed ease, the attack which re
sulted fatally, when first she con
tracted a severe cold. She was in
her 68th year and throughout her
long and active life, maintained the
cheerfulness of youth and vigor, as
a result of which she had always ap
peared much younger than she was.
Mrs. Shanks was born in Shelby
county, the daughter of the late
Hartwell Bailey, and a member of
one of the most prominent families
in the state. Her mother was a
daughter of Neudaker Owsley, and
a sister of the mother of Gov. Owsley
Stanley, making the deceased a first
cousin of the present chief executive
of the commonwealth. She was also
a niece of old Gov. vfm. Owsley. She
was one of five children, her sister,
Mrs. Alice Pickett, of Shelbyville,
mother of Mrs. William Severance of
this city, being the oldest; the others
-were Mrs. Shanks, the late Mrs. Bon
nie, of Chattanooga, Mrs. Carrithers,
also deceased and Carroll Bailey, the
only brother, now living in Missouri.
Soon after the civil war, she be
came the wife of John H. Shanks, a
leading business man, banker and cit
izen o Lincoln county, and she came
here with him and has made this her
home ever since. After his death in
1883, she remained here on her
handsome farm and Teared her chil
dren in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord, and lived to see them all
honored and respected citizens of
their several communities. To Mr.
and Mrs. Shanks five children were
givenr one daughter, Rebecca, dying
in young childhood. Those who sur
vive are Mrs. H. Kirby Bourne, of
New Castle, at whose home the moth
er was visiting when the end came;
William Carroll Shanks, who farms
the old homestead at the edge of
Stanford on lower East Main street;
Thomas H. Shanks, a prominent law
yer, and John H. Shanks, a business
man, both of Columbus, Georgia.
Mrs. Shanks' father, Hartwell Bailey,
was a brother of Carroll Bailey, fa
ther of Judge James P. Bailey, of
this city, and in other lines she was
connected with families whose names
have been synonymous with the early
history and progress of the state of
Kentucky.
In early life she became a member
of the Christian church, and through
out her long life, was ever devoted
to its work for the cause of her Mas
ter. She was ready for the sum
mons when the Death Angel came
for her, and behind her leaves an ex
ample which will ever be a bright
and shining light for her children
and those who come after them.
The body was brought here from
Hew Castle Thursday evening by Mr.
and Mrs. Bourne, and after services
at her home this afternoon conducted
"by her pastor, Rev. D. M. Walker,
the mortal remains were placed be
side those of her husband who had
gone so long before, in Buffalo
"Siting;
rings cemetery.

HARVEY WILKINSON'S NICE JOB
Harvey Wilkinson, second son of
Mr. and Mrs. Ed Wilkinson, went to
Washington, D. C, with Congress
man Harvey Helm, early this week,
to take a clerical and stenographic
position in his office. He will work
under Secretary George Willis.
Young Wilkinson has been taking a
special stenographic and typewriting
course in a business college at Louis
ville for the past several months
and has specially fitted himself for
the nice position he goes to Wash
ington to assume. He is a fine young
man in every way and his hcst of
friends feel sure that he will more
than make good. He graduated from
the Stanford High School last year.
It is peculiarly fitting ,that he should
receive this place from Congressman
Helm. The young man's father, has
been a life-long friend and supporter
of Mr. Helm and named the boy lot
the congressman.
JOHN CHRISMAN DIES QUICKLY
The community was greatly shock
ed to learn of the death of John N.
Chrisman, of the Hedgeville section,

Chrisman was striken with pneumon
ia while at her bedside and succumb

wif e and nine children. He was about
60 years of age and a splendid citi
zen in every way. A few years ago
he came from Wayne county and
bought a farm of 147 acres from R.
L. Hubble in the Hedgeville section
of Boyle, and had made a host of
warm friends since coming here. He
had for many years been a member
of the Methodist church and was an
honorable, upright citizen in every
way. His death is a severe blow to
his loved ones and friends.
SUITS OVER SALE COMMISSIONS
Two interesting land suits were
tried in county court here early this
week involving commissions alleged

leson, of Waynesburg, for $80 com
mission on the sale of his farm, was
dismissed by Judge Bailey. The real

a judgment for $50 subject to a $25
credit against T. B. Manning. An
other suit by-Guinn & Thompson
against Manning, was withdrawn.

TRIED TO RUN WRONG NIGGER
Milledgeville Boy Makes It Hot For
Bunch of Liberty Coons
Denis Tucker, the colored black
smith at Milledgeville, was assaulted
at Liberty last week by a gang of
colored men there who tried to run
him away from the home of the
dusky damsel upon whom he was
calling. When the crowd began to
'play too rough, Tucker unlimbered
his .38 and struck one of the bunch
with a bullet in the mouth, and it
came out between his ear and chin.
The wound was nothing serious, as
it is said the man went to work the
next day. Tucker gave bond for his
appearance in court and was back
home next day for business at his
shop. The Liberty negroes are said
to have been in the habit of trying
to "run" visiting yojng bucks who
came a-courting, but the next time
they go after one it is pretty certain
that they won' tackle him if he is
from Milledgeville and especially if
his name is Denis Tucker. Tucker is
a quiet, well behaved negro and has
a great many friends among the
white people.
TWO LOCAL ALFALFA GROWERS
Prominent in Meeting of State Al
falfa Meeting at Lexington.
Two Lincoln county alfalfa grow
ers were prominently recognized at
the meeting of the Kentucky Alfalfa
Growers' Association at Lexington
this week. Mr. W. P. Givens of near
ity, was elected vice-presi-
he association, and he and
ight, of this city were
the executive committee.
gton Herald said that the
ade by Mr. Givens on his
raisyag-alfalftj was ont' of
es of the, meeting. The
d: The annual meeting
tucky Alfalfa Growers'
at the Kentucky Agricul-
periment Station was fea
tured by an address delivered by W.
P. Givens, of Stanford. Mr. Givens
gave many important side lights on
the raising and curing of the plant.
In a very forceful manner he de
scribed the preparation of the
seed, and the cutting and curing of
the hay. He told of his actual ex
perience in recent years in curing the
alfalfa so that it would retain the
light green color which is very es
sential in commercial hay. The grow
ers in western states have always
been very successful along this line
and some thought it impossible for
Kentucky farmers, because of cli
matic conditions, to be able to do so.
Secretary T. F. Bryant, in his re
port, told of three new clubs with
foiiy-nine membeis having been ad
ded, making a total of fourteen clubs
in the organization. A co-operative
order for seed was placed for 3,600
barrels of alfalfa seed, after the
careful testing of a large number
of samples submitted. A very low
price was secured and seed of ex
ceptionally high germinating value
were obtained. One pamphlet on
the subject of alfalfa production has
been issued.
The following officers for the en
suing year were elected:
President Hughes Farmer, of
Henderson.
Vice-President W. P. Givens, of
Stanford.
Secretary T. R. Bryant, Lexing
ton. C. F. Kleiderer, of Henderson,
and W. P. Givens, of Stanford, were
chosen the members of the Executive
Committee for two years. S. Fish
er, E. E. Barton, J. Field and Wil
liam Bright were elected members of
the committee for the next year.
Mrs. George Ruble, 48, died at her
home in the Buena Vista section of
Garrard of pneumonia. Her husband
and four children survive.
Champ Clark declines to run for
governor of Missouri.
