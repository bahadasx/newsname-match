Prominent Woman Dead
Mrs. L. E. Cook expired at
her home in this city Monday
night at 11:60 after an illness of
about two weeks With pneumon
ia, superinduced by lagrippe, her
sisters, Mrs. Geo. Wilson and
Mrs. Roberta Moore and her
granddaughters, Misses Snavely
being with her at the end.
Florilla A. B. Hurt was born
in this county at the old family
homestead in the southeastern
part of the county October 4,
1842.
During her early girlhood she
attended the country schools and
completed her education at Fay
ette college during the presiden
cy, of Dr. W. Luckey.
She was the oldest daughter of
Judge M. C. and Pannelia Hurt
and surviving her are her sisters
Mrs. Geo. F. Wilson, Mrs. W.
G. White, Mrs. Roberta Moore
and her aunt, Mrs. Arthur
Price of Hamden, and her son
Lon and granddaughters Misses
Urcel and Paula Snavely of Kan
sas City.
Florilla Hurt was married to
Lucian E. Cook of College Mound
Mo., January 3,1864, and to the
union was born three children,
Belle M. (Mrs. Jas. Snavely)
Thomas Edgar, who died in in
fancy and Leonidas. Mrs. Snave
ly died May 12, 1915, Lon being
the only one of the family sur
viving. L. E. Cook died at his
home in this city May 27, 1914,
and since his death his widow
made her home at one or the
other of her residences in the
city with a girl companion.
About the year 1867 Mr, and
Mrs. Cook moved to a farm west
of this city and a year or so later
to the home northwest ' of town
where they farmed , until about
1882 when "they came to town
and entered the mercantile busi
ness, first a grocery store, then
a general merchandise store
and then dry goods and notions
in the building which they built
for themselves and now occupied
by Thrash Bros, drug store.
. Mrs. L. E. Cook was almost al
ways in the lime light and had
some more than ordinary gifts
as a writer speaker and debater
and a few years ago entered the
political arena and ..made the
race for recorder of: deeds f Af
ter her defeat' she quit1 politics
and devoted herself toiler busi
ness interests until some ' vital
questions affecting public policy
sprung up, when she again
launched her oratorical and de
bating forces and more or less
has been a champion of one or
the other sides of all great ques
tions now before the people.
Firm in her convictions, open
and fearless in her expressions,
with a high nervous tension and
indomitable will power, a vocab
ulary and sense of humor seldom
equalled, combined with strenu
ous work at something mental or
manual, Mrs. L. E. Cook was a
woman in a class by herself. No
more sympathetic heart was
ever in human when her feelings
were enlisted in the cause of a
friend, and her devotion to her
husband was .complete, for thru
the struggles he was forced to
make to gain a foothold on the
rock of independence, she was
ever ready and willing to bear
with him, be they; strictest fw
gality or the longest hours of
hard labor. These qualities com
bined with what the world saw
of her life in public , affairsVt ap
peared anomalous to many, but
they went to make up. the, . basis
for . the, suggestion " that. Mrs;
Cook was awijman In a class
by herself : - 'S;. . "
' Funeral services wereheM' it

THE NEWYEAR
Opened on Business Basis.
Quieter Than Usual.
Spring Day.
A single lonesome solemn bell
and a few concentrated revolver
or giant cracker shots about mid
night Saturday night roused a
few in the neighborhood and re
minded them that some event
was being indifferently announc
ed. Saturday morning and prac
tically all day, collectors swarm
ed with bills and all business
houses were open for customers.
Warmer weather and rain had
cleared the snow away and pave
ments and streets were disagree
able. No public demonstrations
and nothing to call particular at
tention to change of dates on
checks and letters. One old ac
count or accusation was settled
with a club, and the toast "Mis
soun Always Wet ' drunic Dy
many until moisture oozed from
their cuticle. .
Public and private resolutions
to do busines on a nearer to cash
basis were adopted pretty gener
ally, informally, a few desultory
glances at conditions which could
and should be remedied, and
back we appear to have settled
comfortably in the old ruts.
But 1916 will bring some wel
come surprises to us. Mark the
prediction.
Council Meeting
The city council met Monday
night and an ordinance of con
siderabje moment was put under
way, or rather an amendment of
an existing ordinance. .
.'This amended : ordina.nc.ewil!
provide for imposing a - fine no
to exceed $100 on any boy or oth
er person- caught with a toy , pis
tal, and alike, fine . for shooting
such in thjB; cityV; Firei crackers
are also t&bW.ueri' the -sane
penalty. Any orie selling-, such
or similar, pistol or B. . B. caps or
cartridges to boys .will be sub
ject to the same penalty.
Boys have been getting cart
triages and cutting the tip end
of tbe ball away.' and firing them
from such toy pistols. B B caps
have also - been one of .; the fav
orite loads, and. where, only the.
regular caps,.hayje been, procura
bl0, small naif?, have been used
for bullets andL&re as ' dangerous
as any.
After one boy had his jaw
punctured and one of the best
razor artists in the state partly
scalped by bullets or slugs shot
from these dangerous and deadly
weapons, the mayor and council
thot it about time to act ahead
of a homicide.
The lid without a crack in it
on Sundays was also before the
council and the business pulse is
is going to be ft-lt before recon
sidering. ,
The council ordered the re
pair of several lamp posts with
new ones and the firrt of the
week J. W. Taylor placed sever
al at points . where they were
badly needed.,- When snow and
mud shovels are brought into ac
iton when needed, .we will be
able to get there and back with
out a lantern and hip rubber
boots, y---
