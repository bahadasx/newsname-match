these steps are:
First Guaranteeing of political In

Second An agreement to settle all
outstanding boundary disputes by ar
bitration or other amicable processes.
Third An agreement that all dis
putes be handled by patient Investiga
tion and settled by arbitration.
Fourth An agreement that no State
shall permit a revolutionary expedi
tion against the Government of another
State to be outfitted within Its boun
daries nor permit munition of war to
be exported for such revolutionary
use.

The gathering at Continental Hall
