taice the following obituary
from the Beloit (Wis.) Daily News of
December 29th. Mr. Oliver was a
guest of his cousin Earl Boyce in Can
ton several years ago and the friends
he made while here will be sorry to
learn of his death:
After an illness of five weeks, Fred
L. Oliver, Beloit's oldest mail carrier
in point of years of service, passed
away last night. The end came at
8:45 o'clock at his home, 730 Eleventh
street, auto intoxication being the
oause. From* the first day of his sick
ness Mr. Oliver's condition was re
garded as serious and but faint hopes
for his recovery were entertained at
any time.
Mr. Oliver was 50 years old, Octob
er 26 last. He was born In this cltj
and had spent his entire life wiühin
Its confines. Probably no Individual
in Beloit possessed a larger acquaint
ance. Mr. Oliver during his twenty
four years of service as a mall carrier
had carried every route in ihe city
and was well known to practically
every man. woman and child. He was
a member of Camp No. 348, M. W. A.
In addition to his widow, Mr.
Oliver leaves his aged father, two
sons, two daughters, four brothers,
and five sisters.
Methodist Church
Owing to the death of the wife of
Rev. L. A. McDonald of Wakonda
Rev. Rosenbury was unable to fill his
appointment being Invited to Wakon
da to preach the funeral sermon. He
will be with us next Saboath morning
and fill the pulpit. In the evening
Miss Jennie Hughes, a missionary
from Knoles College, China, will speak
In the interests of the Womans
Foreign Missionary Society. Miss
Hughes is considered one of the best
speakers engaged In the work and
everybody should avail themselves of
this opportunity to hear her. Every
body is invited to all the services of
the day. Hp worth League at 6:30.
The young people are Invited to this
service.
I. E. Smith of Austin, Minn., bet
ter known perhaps to his friends as
"Diets," has come to Canton to make
his home with his brother "Bud"
and will assist him in his barber shop.
Checker Tournament.
The county checker tournament at
Hudson last Saturday was a success
but owing to the^visiting players hav
ing to leave on the 8:15 train the ay
was not finished. The points won
were as follows:
Roy O. Rice 28
James McVay 27
Fred Song 15
Carpenter 15
Gallener 14
Patterson 14
Travaillie 9
Parkin 9
They were disappointed in not
meeting Robert Hales of Canton and
Mr. Rice suggests that the Canton
player extend a challenge to the
three highest men In the tournament.
Have You New Numbers?
We have noticed a few of the 1916
auto numbers but the greater part of
car owners are still operating with
their last year's number but they
should have a receipt ready to show
any officer that they have made ap
plication to the county treasurer for
new numbers. They only cost $3 per
set this year, $2 for motor vehicles.
Dealer's numbers cost 85.
All dealers will be required to have
not only a dealer's original number,
but will be required to display a
duplicate number upon each addi
tional vehicle operated by such deal
er: the duplicate numbers to be pur
chased from the couuty treasurer up
on payment of a fee of fifty cents per
set of two numbers.
Provided, that upon the sale by
such dealer, the purchaser may oper
ate with any form of placard bearing
the dealer's number, of standard size.
Provided further, that such purchas
er must before so operating a vehicle
apply for a regular license. No deal er
is permitted to operate an automo
bile, registered under the dealer's
number, for private use or hire. Such
automobiles must each bear Individ
ual numbers.
The annual meeting of The Masonic
Temple association will be held at the
Temple on Thursday evening Jan. 6,
1916 at 8:00 p. m. You are requested
to be present.

Are You Helping Mr. Business Man?
No town will reach Its greatest pos
sibilities as a business center, unless
all its merchants are making efforts
to attract trade. Where a majority
of the business men rely on a few to
do the advertising and go after trade
the town can not be what it should
be. Too often merchants, professing
not to believe In advertising, and not
doing any advertising themselves,
reap the benefit of advertising from
the trade that naturally drifts to
their places after being attracted to
town by their more wide awake bro
ther merchants. Any merchant who
induces people to come to town and
trade is helping the entire commun
ity, and no town is a complete suc
cess unless all lines are advertising
and working to extend the trade as
far as possible and trying to bring a
larger territory in the circle of which
the town is the business center. Just
one instance: The mill pays a good
price for milling wheat and induces a
farmer from a distance to bring his
wheat to town. The farmer gets his
money for bis wheat, buys a suit of
clothes, of the clothier, gets a piece
of furniture for the home, a dress for
his daughter, some lumber or fence
for repairs, a jag of coal, eats a couple
of meals at restaurant or hotel, plays
a game of pool, gets a hair cut and
shave, smokes a cigar or two. This is
not an over drawn Illustration, but a
sample of what is happening In Can
ton in similar ways every day. And
it shows that the business man of any
kind who thinks he is independent
and under no obligation to his fellow
business men, has an extremely nar
row vision. We are all in the same
beat and the closer we organize for
true team work the better will we all
succeed.

Unpleasant Experiences
Are practically unknown to our customers who
use our Clean Coals.
WHY?
Because our trade consists principally of people who
are willing to pay a little more money for a better
article. The coal we sell has pleased the crankiest
and most critical buyers. GOOD COAL—That's
where we are strong. Semi Anthracite and Jake's
Best are sold exclusively by us. Buying other coal
because it is cheaper than ours is like turning the
