Absolves Clark, Jones and.

RULING BELOW STANDS
Seminole Securities Company in
Described as a "Baloon Floate<l
by Hot Air."
The supreme court of South Carolina
rendered a decision yesterday
in the celebrated Seminole Securities
case, by which Wilie Jones, T. S.
~Jlryan and W. A. Clark, well known
^ybiisiness men of Columbia, ate absolved
from wrongdoing In connection
with the promotion that had the attention
of thte people of the State for
several years. The majority opinion
was written by Associate Justice
Gage. Associate Justice Fraser filed
a dissenting opinion.
The action was brought in Kochland
oounty by J. S. Klugli, T. J.
Crymems, J. L. Watson and J. F.
Dalton against the officers and trustees
of the Setnlnole Securities comnfliiv
niul apvpral hnnUu
"Remotely it Is," says the supreme
court, "are the defendants, Clark,
Jones and Bryan, personally liable
to the stockholders of the Seminole
Securities company for $30,000 for
a breach of trust. The circuit court
found that they were not, "and we
agree."
PLAINTIFFS PROMOTERS ALSO.
The court does not go into a full
history of the defunct company, but
recites only the cardinal features as
affecting the defendants. The company
was chartered January 8,1908,
with a capital stock of $300,000.
The enterprise ran its whole career
within 12 months. The court says
that the plaintiff stockholders "are
amongst those whd undertook to
hoist the enterprise."
"It is true," says the opinion,
"that Garlington and his immediate
associates were the initiators of he
scheme, but the plaintiffs and all
the stockholders stood by like Saul
consenting to the death. And they
are those now complaining against
Clark, Jones and Bryan because the
scheme failed."
There is no allegation, the court
says, that Clark, Jones or Bryan
held any stock or took any hand in
the suggestion or direction of the
Seminole company or received any
compensation.
The opinion concludes as follows:
"We conclude that the stockholders
of the Seminole, the plaintiffs
amongst them, got up the corporation
set it going and named the directors.
It was on Its face a ballon floated by
hot air.
"These directors, who made the
contract with the trdustees, had the
power to modify it; to buy stock In
^ an existing company, and to permit
the trustees to take a part and not
all of the stock of an accident company.
"If the stockholders In the Seminole
have been decel\ed it has been
^ by the action of the men they put
forward to represent them, to-wit:
"The event proves that those hitherto
unknown and untried men
hoisted a scheme which neither their
stockholders nor trustees under.
AM/I U'k i..l< ~K?.* *?./v a i ? ~ i ..
oiuuu . anvi ? nu n u?it iui uir iiuit;iy
initiative or the plaintiffs themselves
and the bold action of the court to
which they went might have wrought
serious damage.
JUDGMENT I1KLOW AFFIRMED.
"The Judgment of the circuit court
is affirmed.
Concerning the alleged effort to
mislead the public, the decision says:
"That is to say, the president and
directors of the Seminole company,
'the managing officers,' put forward
^lael# T/vnao AA/I D??.A ? J
vim n, tfvuco auu uk jau iu 111 mirau
the public. But the stockholders
put forward the managing officers!
as their representatives and the
scheme of those managers was thus <
made possible the act of the
stockholders. The stockholders 1
vouched for Oarllngton; may they J
now say Clark. Jones and Bryan
could not? If therefore. those i
stockholders have been caught, It Is i
in a trap of their own setting. i
"So the question Is. ought the i
i trustees, mere volunteers without '
\ pay, and with no interest in i
the Seminole ompany, to be made to i
respond to such complaints for $30.- i
000 alleged to have been lost by the i
jjlljarffo of the trustees?

the vehicle today for another
discussion of foreign relations on the
floor of the Senate. It preceded the
adoption without opposition of a resolution
offered by Senator Fall calling
on President Wilson for all available
information bearing upon the
recognition of the Carranza Government

Senators Fall and Lodge spoke in
support of the resolution, insisting
that the President should inform
Congress fully oncerning the situation
before the nomination of an
Ambassador to Mexico was confirmed.
Senator Williams diverted atten

the debate by commenting at length
upon questions arising from the European
war. He said an embargo or

United States Will Maintain It on
Her Own Authority?Attitude
Towards Others.
Washington, Jan. 6.?The United
States Government's Pan-American
policy was revealed indetail by President
Wilson tonight in an address
before the second Pan-American
Scientific Congress. lie explained
. the proposals submitted to South and
( Central American diplomats here last
week by Secretary Lansing as a bo(
sis for an effective agreement be|
tween all the renuMi"- "*
<ji nit- westJem
Hemisphere "not only tor the
1 international peace of America, but
the domestic peace of America."
This program, as outlined by the
President, proposes that all the
American Nations shall take ron\certed
action as follows:
Guarantee to each other absolute
political independence and territorial
integrity.
Agree to settle all pending bounj
dary disputes as soon as possible by
amicable processes.
? Agrae to handle all disputes aris.
ing among theni by patient, impar1
tial investigation and to settle them
t b" arbitration.
i Agree that no revolutionary expe>'
dition shall be outfitted against or
supplies for revolutionists shipped
- to neighboring States.
He said the Monroe Doctrine always
had been and always would bo
1 maintained by the United States on
1 its own authority, but that the doc1
trine did not disclose what attitude
" the United States would assume toB
wards other Nations ot' the hemis'
phere, and consequently the other
* Nations had been distrustful of it.
9 In this connection the President
t said:
?
"The Monroe Doctrine was proelaimemd
by the United States on her
* own authority. It always has been
maintained and always will be maintained
upon her own responsibility.
P But the Monroe Doctrine demanded
| merely that European Governments
! should not attempt to extend their
. political systems to this side of tha
Atlantic. It did not disclose the use
. which the United States intended to
s make of her power on this side of
? the Atlantic. It was a hand held up
1 in warning, but there was no promise
t in it of what America was going to
. do with the implied and partial protectorate
which she apparently was
. trying to set up on this side of the
> water and I believe you will sustain
> me in this statement that it has been
. fears and suspicions on this sr>nr<?
j which have hitherto prevented the
greater intimacy and confidence and
.[trust between the Americans. The
States of America have not been
. | certain what the United States would
*; do with her power. This doubt
s i must be removed.
|
i "And latterly there has been a
I j very frank interchange of views be
I twccn the authorities in Washing'.ton
and those who represented the
> other States of this hemisphere, an
i interchange of views charming and
inopeiul, because based upon an
increasingly sure appreciation of the
: spirit in which tliey were undertaken.
These gentlemen have seen that if
t America is to couie into her own, inl!to
her legitimate own, in a world of
peace and order, she must establish
! the foundations of amity so that no
cvne will hereafter doubt them.
"I hope and I believe that this can
be accomplished These conferences
j have enabled me to foreseen how it
i would be accomplished. It will be
accomplished In the first place by
the States of America uniting in
guaranteeing to each other absolute
political Independence and territorial
. Integrity. In the second place
and as a necessary conrollary to that,
i guaranteeing tho aoraomont
j tie ail pending boundary dispute*
among themselves should they uni
happily arise, will be handlel by
patient, impartial investigation and
settled by arbitration; and the agreement
necessary to the peace of the
