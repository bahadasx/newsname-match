SOMETIMES APPLY LIGHTLY
For cuts, burns, scalds, sores and
open wounds always apply Hanford's
Balsam lightly, but be sure , that it
covers and gets to the bottom of the
wound. A few light applications are
generally all that is needed to heal
this class of difficulties. adv.

SET UP HEW PLANS
Within a few days Frank W. Mil
ler, state school superintendent, will
announce complete plans for the con
duct of a state corn boys' - ontest next
year. This is the turn taken as the
result of the difficulty between the
new state board of agriculture and
former contest manager, T. P. Rid
dle. That such contests may be pro
perly under supervision of the state
school superintendent and become a
part of the agricultural work In the
schools seems to be generally accept
ed. The work is to be conducted by
th county superintendents in the var
ious counties, and trips will be ar
ranged by them.
Suspicion cast on the previous con
test by the charges of personal gain,
the exposure of the plan for the con
test manager to run a huge state ex
hibit excursion to the Panama Paci
fic fair at state expense to promote
Willis presidential aspirations, and
the forcing of tLe contest manager on
an unwilling board, with he disa
greements betwen Secretary Duniap
and Manager Riddle, all caused a
share of the failure of the recent corn
boys' contest. As a matter of fact it
developed into nothing more than a
big railroad excursion and the news
papers of the state quite properly re
fused to give free publicity to such
a cause. The plans of the state
board of agriculture would not add
any confidence In the project for an
other year, and it is perhaps well that
the educational department has de
cided to take over the work, for this
year at least. It is assured that the
work in the department of education
will at least be harmonious, and there
is not possible any suspicion that
anyone in the department will be
working in the interest of any but
the state of Ohio and the boys who
will enter the contest.

MEDIUM-PRICED AUTOS WITH LOW
UP-KEEP, SAYS JOHN N. WILLYS
New York, Jan. 1. "It Is Intensely In
teresting to compure the questions of mo
tor enthusiasts who are attending the
show this season with questions asked by
vsitor.-i of former years" remarked John
N. Willys, president of the Willys-Over
land Company, of Toledo, O., after over-
heartug the leinarks of several visitors
to salesmen in the Overland booth at the
Grand Central Palace.
"As 1 stood there listening a moment
ago 1 could not help thinking of the tre-
inenuuous changes which have taken
place in the automobile industry in a
comparatively short time, changes benefi
cial to both tlie general public and the
motor car manufacturer.
It has only bee nwithln the last year
or so that the purchase of an automobile
has been considered from the standpoint
ol a tiusiness investment. latg, Heavy
cars, costing up in the thousands of dol
lars, were all that would formerly inter
est the people, even of moderate means,
and as for those who could afford a high-
priced car, they would no more think of
driving any-inuig else man warning.
"A striking evidence of the trend of
the times is shown in two sales reported
by Overland dealers within the laut few
weeks. In both cases four cylinder Ov-
eriands were purchased by men to whom
price was a matter 01 little moment, one
is a prominent unued tiaies senator,
the other President of one of the best
known Western railroads.
But the manufacturer doing business
on a large productioin scale has been the
evolutionary intluence m tne automobile
Industry. He is the individual who has
demonstrated that a motor car of pleas
iug appearance, possessing good riding
qualities and which will give good service
can be sold for a very moderate price
whin manufactured in large quantities.
"To my way of thinking, tlie feature
which Is really responsible for the suc
cess of the medium priced automobile is
its low up-keep expense

BKUI.V IUiHT ON THEE BLIGHT
The fall and early winter months;
afford an excellent opportunity to
lean up the orchard and to wage a
fight against fruit diseases, according
to the department of horticulture,
Ohio State University. All diseased
and blight Infested parts of the trees
should be cut out and burned. The
blight during the past season has
been worse than usual and care must
be taken to prevent Its spread if the
rchard is to be saved. In cutting
out blighted parts the dead bark
should be cut away leaving in sharp
contrast the live portion. The dead

blight.
II Kilt bit TAXES
Some citizens complain about high
er taxes this year. Here and there
some fellow kicks who thought by
electing Wills he would have lower
taxes. Tax rates will not be less un-
er Willis than under Governor Cox.
The people ought to realize that a
lot of cheap promises made to get
votes are more likely to work injury
and hardship than to ben fit them
When taxes are higher in a commun
ity local conditions usually call for
same. Better roads ana Detter
schools are worth more money. The
false cry of Willis for economy has
not saved Ohio a single cent. The
folly, ignorance, extravagance, and
intense partisan ship of the Willis ad-
inistration have cost Ohio many
dollars as well as honor and prestige.

KOOSEVKLT AS A CANDIDATE
Many people believe that Colonel
Roosevelt will be the Republican can
didate for president next year.
There are some signs of it now, but
they will have to multiply a great
deal before the expectation will be
realized. It would certainly mix up
the situation badly. Teh Democarts
would not complain much, but hosts
of Republicans would. As matter
stand now, President Wilson will get
a large Republican vote, and If Colo
nel Roosevelt is the candidate, Wil
son will get a larger one. But if he
Is not nominated, waht then? There
will be a scrimmage on hand of large
and interesting proportions. If the
colonel would only come out for Mr.
Burton he would gain many friends
that he has sometime lost. Our ad
vice to him is to stand for Ohio's can
didate Ohio State Journal, Repub
lican.
