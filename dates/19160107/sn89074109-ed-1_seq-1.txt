AUTO ACCIDENT
CAR TURNS TURTLE
Another accident due to slippery
icy roads occurred early Tuesday
Afternoon and resulted very for
tunately, all things considered, al
though quite seriously enough to
those implicated.
Shortly after one o'clock Dr. S. W.
"Bailey, accompanied by Dr. C. L. T.
Herbert started in his big White
touring car for the farm near Bailey.
In trying to avoid a frozen bump in
the road, nbout four miles out, Dr.
Bailey turned the front wheels to one'
-side but the car skidded and the
'wheel hit the bump side wise, which
caused the car to turn turtle with
lioth men underneath, Dr. Herbert
losing consciousness and Dr. Bailey
being pinned down by the steering
wtkeel. The latter, after about a
twenty minutes' struggle, was in
some way able to crawl out and suc
ceeded later in shutting off the pow
«r, and with almost superhuman
strength was able to relieve the pres
sure on his companion by jacking
the edge of the car up. By the help
of several grain men, who happened
Along, Dr. Herbert, who was quite
seriously injured was extricated.
A passing car took Dr. Herbert to
town, where he was at once placed in
St. Joseph's hospital, and on exam
ination it was disclosed that he had
a dislocated collar bone and a
sprained ankle. A car from the city
"went back to the scene of the cat
astrophe to get Dr. Bailey who was
-somewhat dazed by the accident had
at first rfeused to leave his car. Dr.
Bailey's condition was not sufficient
ly serious to necessitate hospital
treatment, although he was badly
bruised, his hand being cut and his
back being quite lame.
Dr. Bailey was out again on
Thursday when he took up Dr. Her
bert's practice for a week or two
until the latter will be able to con
tinue his work.
The car was towed in later, a
•wheel, the radiator and the steering
gear entirely out of commissi an.

The Cando bank passed the
check but almost at once discovered
the forgery and phoned the local
bank not to turn over the cash. Just
as Reiser was boarding a train for
the east, officers received word to
arrest him for the murder of Fink.
A bank clerk located the man for the
officers. Reiser told the sheriff he
had never been in jail before and
that he wanted to make a clean
bieast of it.
He and Fink had been chums all
their lives, their families living to
gether in Hungary they came to St.
Paul in 1902, and worked during
harvest near Cando, going west to
Missoula, Butte and Bozeman, and
then out in the country 20 miles to
Salesville, where they were "bach
ing" it while looking for work. The
night of the tragedy, he said, they
quarreled over the bed covers, Fink
claiming Reiser had more than his
share. The quarrel waxed furious,
Reiser says, and Fink fired at him
but missed then Fink took an ax
and struck him, injuring his arm.
Reiser says he then got the axe and
hit Fink over the head and killed
him. He had receipts and papers
belonging to Fink and two watehes,
two suits of clothes etc.
Reiser is about 38 and has a wife
and child in Hungary.

Persian Was
Not Torpedoed
Washington* Jan. 6.—American
Consul Garrels at Alexandria re
ported that affidavits he had gath
ered from Persia survivors gave no
more proofs that a submarine tor
pedoed the liner, or regarding its
nationality than were contained in
his first dispatches.
So far the only actual statement
tending to prove that the ship was
torpedoed came from one of the of
ficers of the Persia. He said he
saw what he thought was the wake
of a torpedo. No submarine was
seen at the time. The absence of
further definite advices is holding
the situation, so far as any action
by the United States is concerned,
at a standstill.
Washington, Jan. G.—Ambassador
Penfield cabled that he had present
ed informally to the Vienna foreign
office the American government's
request for any information on the
destruction of the British liner Per
sia, and that at the time of filing his
dispatch he had received no reply.
THE TRIALS OF A
FARMER WHO MOVED
TO TOWN
In Farm and Fireside is the story
of a fanner who sold his property
to live in the city, because his city
friends "wore good clothes, had mon
ey jingling in their packets, went to
the movies, belonged to clubs and
enjoyed li yearly vacation." He found
however, that the city man pays
dearly for these luxuries.
"We came to know," he said, "that
it was just as hard for the city man
to get up at 7 o'clock in the morn
ing as it was for the country man
to get up at five. Why so? Be
cause he must not relax he is ever
on duty. He must smile at this per
son. He dares not notice anyone's
peculiarities, or oddities, or unreas
onableness. The result is he must
find relaxation in the evening there
fore, the family rarely gets to bed
before 10 or 11 o'clock, and 7 in the
morning making him just as sleepy
and far less freshed than 5 found
him on the farm.
"We found going to work for
somebody else every day in the year,
except Sunday and perhaps a two
weeks' vacation, under somebody
else as manager, didn't exactly suit
our country spirit of freedom. We
came to know that our friends saved
scarcely a cent and furthermore,
one couldn't exactly see how they
were extravagent. In the city it
seems unbelievably hard to separate
luxuries from necessities."
Miss Cora Finkle who has been
visiting with her parents during the
holidays returned yesterday to Chi
cago where she is a nurse at the Ger
man-American
hospital in that city.

Mother is Dead
Mrs. ifcseph Stark of Ruso, Who
Gave Birth to a Child in This
CityT^ Has Gene to Eternal Rest.
Ward County Independent, Dec.31.
—Mrs. Joseph Stark, wife of a pro
minent Ruso farmer, passed away
at St. Joseph's hospital Tuesday aft
ernoon at 4 o'clock.
Mrs. Stark gave birth to a "twi-,
light sleep" baby at the hospital on
Christmas eve, the babe being a ten
pound girl. Hr attending physician
reported her condition favorable,
following the birth of the child and
the first report »ivcn out was that
the twilight sleep method was a
great success.
The best medical authorities dis
approve of the "twilight sleep"
method and a short time ago sev
eral of our country's most eminent
physicians issued a statement over
their signatures which appeared in
the press Warning against the prac
tice of it, except l»y specialists. For
several years, there has been more
or less dispute concerning this metli
hut it is pretty generally conceed
ed in the medical world that it is a
method that4~shou!d be let strictly
alone. One great trouble is the
mother is frequently left more or
less delirious, her condition becoming
uucoiitrolable.
The twilight sleep is produced by
giving an injection of morphine and
scopolainin and geeral practitioners
are warned by the-b^st medical au
thorities to leave it strictly alone.
It was reported that this was the
first twilight sleep babe born in the
state. This is an error. Four years
ago, when the method was first dis
covered, one- of our phycisians em
ployed it in four instances. Fortun
ately mothers and babes all lived,
but he soon concluded that the work
was too dangerous to follow up.
Twilight sleep bab«^ were born in
Grand Forks, Fargo and other cities
of the state, bnt one hears little of
the method because most physicians
have concludcd not to take the risk
of injecting the drugs that produce
it. Minot physicians years ago gave
up this practice.
Mandan, N. D., Jan. 5.—Three

Meat Markets
Are Now Merged
Sentinel Butte Republican—A deal
was closed this week between II. K.
Balthauser and W. E. Hicks, an
nouncement of which will be found
in the advertismcnt on another page
of this paper, whereby Mr. Balthau
ser became the owner of Mr. Hicks'
meat market and will close the old
market and beginning next Monday,
transact business only at the new
place, first door west of the First
National Bank.
Mr. Balthauser says that his idea
in getting control of the meat busi
ness of iiie town is iiot to take ad
vantage of the situation and boost
prices, but to insure to the public a
better and more fully stocked mar
ket and better service. He says
there is not room here for two good
markets but with only one he can
run a first class pluce.
Mr. Hicks is undecided as to his
future maves but says he will stay
in Sentinel Butte at least until the
end of the school term, on account
of his family. He will continue to
attend to the auctioneer business
and his business card to that effect
appears in this issue.
