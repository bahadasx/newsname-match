On May 3 ??. Hamilton -ays. li" ask"d
for two fresh divisions to enable htm
t? ? continue th' attack, i >n the 17th
lie a train cabled, stating that he. re
quired two army corps. One division
was sent, and in June I.ord Kitchener
promised three r< gular divisions at d.
! in addition, the infantry of two terri- i
torial divisions.
August 0 was the day fixed for th"
big attack, the object of which, as
jstated by General Hamilton. w:?a:
"First, to break out with a rush
from Ansae and cut off the bulk of the
Turkish army from land ? oinmutiica
tion with Constantinople
"Second, to cut of;' ti e hulk of 'he

one of those moments. The scarped

In the attack on Chanak-Bair or. Au
; gust !? the Knglish plans miscarried,
'somewhat owing to the mischance ofi
! General Baldwin's nonarrival in time
with supporting troops, owing to his
losing his way through the darkness

The report continues.
"Instead of Baldwin's* support. - * hei?

' The Ki-.glish front was held by two
'battalions of the Sixth North Lan

wc-te "weakened in numbers, though n?>t
in spirit." lie continues:
"First, our men were shelled i-y

huge column consisting of no less than
a full division plus three battalions
"Th> North Lancashire men were
simply overwhelmed in their shallow
trenches by sheer weight of numbers,
while the Wiltshires, who were caught
in the open, were literally almost anni
hilated.
"The ponderous mass of the enemy
swept over the crest and swarmed
round our troops, who had to give
ground, and were only extricated with
great ditiiculty and very heavy losses.
"Now. it was our turn. The war
ships and the New Zealand and Aus
tralian Artillery and Indian Mountain
Artillery Brigade and the Sixty-ninth
Brigade of Iloyal Field Artillery were
getting the chance of a lifetime.
"As successive solid lines of Turks
topped the crest of the ridge, gaps
were torn through their formation, and
an iron rain fell on them as they tried
to rn-form in tlie gullies. Not here only
did the Turks pay dearly for their
recapture of the vital crest.

LONDON, January t>.?Organized labor
of (".rent I'ritaln, sitting in congress
in London to-day. decided against the
?rovernmrnt's compulsion bill by the
overwhelming majority of 1,0!iS.i)0
voles to 7S.5,000.
Hostility to the government's measure
was uncompromising. ami necessitated
tbe resignation from th ? coalition min
istry of all throe l.abor members,
(Arthur Henderson, William Ri'nc1 and
j (.Scorer II. Roberts. holding. respec
tively. the olllces of president of 'he
Roard of Education. Parliamentary
I"nder-Secro.tary for Home Affairs and
Lord I'oniinissipnf-r <?f tbe Treasury,
and their resignations were announced
during the evening.
The labor congress was in many wayn
tbe most important body of the k'nd
ever assembled. More than 1.000 dele
Kates were present, representing 100
unions and n.ooo.oou workers.
In addition to the formal vote against
the government's compulsion bill, 'he
? roncrross by four to ono n mo

compulsion for single men. and passed
by two to one another motion directing
the Labor party to oppose the bill In

to tierce enthusiasm with an out-and
out nn'.icompulslun speei.h. appealing to
the trade-unions "not to sell their
heritage of freedom
A speech by Arthur Henderson, presi
dent of the Board of Education, came
as a sedative to the passionate feelings
aroused l?y the earlier speakers. He
spoke calmly and logically, defending
not merely the resolution before (he
| meeting, which held that Labor mem
bers in the House of Commons should
be left free to vote as they saw tit.
but also the compulsion bill itself.
Hut his effort was insutilcient to turn
the tide of opposition, and it was a
foregone conclusion when the vote
dually was reached that the resolution
would fall.

With the exception of the Miners'
Federation. which refused to partici
pate. owing to internal differences with
the joint board, virtually every trade
union of importance in the country was
r< presented In (be congress. The num

one source as Sol', made up as follows:
trade-unions, 1511: trade councils and
local Labor parties, v:; independent
Labor partv organizations. 1
Colonel John Ward. SI. I'., who calls
himself an "Independent Laborite." and
is one of the picturesipie figures of the
House of Commons, declared in the
house to-night that the decision of the
labor ''Ongress could not be regarded
as actually representing the will of the
labor men of the country.
"For." said he, "you must consider
the fact that certainly from one-half
to one-third of the members of the
trade organizations which met in con
gress are either in tbe trenches or
preparing to take their places there
I, for one, in common with many other
thinking labor men. will support th.
