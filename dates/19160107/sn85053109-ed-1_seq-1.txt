Gas Well Near Sweet Grass
The roar of escaping gas from
the oil well on the Pritchard
ranch can be heard for miles.
It was struck Sunday, at a depth
of 1700 feet. The flow is ffom
a six-inch pipe and shows a
pressure of 120 pounds. The
gas leaps into the air 50 or 60
feet and has an estimated flow
of 10,000,000 cubic feet per day.
The gas in the well has a pres
sure of about 800 pounds per
square inch. Many oil wells in
this field will' use this gas for
power and light. Many Ranch
ers will soon be supplied with
an abundance 0Ï gas for heat
and light.
A great nttm hereof ^prominent
men from Butte, Spokane, Cal
gary and other points are daily
visiting this oil field. Spring
will find oil towns scattered all
over this country.—Shelby Pro

Senator Gibson Advises
Sowing of Spring Wheat
Founder of Great Fall* Predicts High Grain Prices
for Coming Crop, ëûiiali Acreage of Winter
Wheat Sown in Montana this Fall
Asserting his belief in the
certainty that wheat prices #ill
continue to rise and giving his
reasons for such views, Senator
Paris Gibson yesterday pointed
out why he believes the farm
ers of Montana who have small
winter wheat acreage ought to
get re?dy to sow as much spring
wheat as possible. Senator
Gibson prepared the following
statement covering his views:
"As we enter the new year,
the grain situation becomes
more interesting. That the
price of wheat will steadily ad
vance, until last year's high
water mark is reached, if not
exceeded, must be apparent to
every careful observer of the
grain market. I commend to
our Montana farmers the fol
lowing comments from Chicago
and New York, appearing on
Dec. 30, last, on the wheat Situ
ation:
" 'Chicago—The year doses
with brilliant prosperity news,
that suggests record flour con
sumption for 1915-16,' said E. W.
Wagner. 'Abroad we witness
190,000,000 bushels surplus
wheat in Australia and Argen
tina that Europe cannot reach
for many weeks. This fact
raises the question for a 20-cent
premium for May over July
wheat. The popular idea is
higher grain prices based on
needs of Europe. We have
seen May wheat advance 80
«•ats, on haavy receipts,, and
thrqurntinm
when the
tfce œm -
ket advances when the receipts
dwindle: Are we to witness a
repetition of last January and
February, when the wheat need
of Europe ranked above 'buying
diplomacy/ and the highest
prices since 1898 were recorded?"

Late private European advices
state foreign supplies are not
available in sufficient quanti
ties, that native movement is
not forthcoming as fast as ex
pected or as needed and that
importers must come to this
country to supply their wants
as England controls the Cana
dian and Australian surpluses.
Exporters say a large percentage
of the ocean grain capacity now
used is chartered on the other
side and a great deal of the
grain sold for export is at f. o. b.
terms, the buyer furnishing the
freight room.'
"In this connectionit is well to
bear in mind that we can hard
ly expect a great yield in the
United States for 1916, follow
ing the phenomenal yields of
1914 and 1915. Owing to the
immense weight of the Mon
tana wheat crop last year, re
quiring the united effort of our
farmers to secure it, a much
smaller acreage of winter wheat
can be counted upon for our
state the present year. During
the present winter months, our
farmers who are short on win
1er. wheat acreage, should secure
ti» test quality of No. 1 hard
wheat for spring sowing, for I
confidently believe that we
shall see a higher price for
wheat than has been touched
since the war began. If No. 1
hard wheat caunot be obtained
here, it should be shipped from
North Dakota. — Great Falls

There are many sincere ex
pressions of regret over the
death of Ira Masterman. He
has two children here, and was
well and favorably known on
the Reservation. He was work
ing for Jack Hyde at Lubec,
and while engaged at work near
a tree that was being chopped
down he was caught by it and
his skull was crushed. He was
not quite in line with the fall
ing tree, but as a matter of pre
caution the men shouted warn
ing, and he ran under it instead
of away from it. He lived sev
eral days in a delirious condi
tion and died in the hospital at
Kalispell. H i s remains were
brought here for burial. The
funeral service was conducted
by Dr. Gold in the Presbyterian
church in the presence of a large
congregation. The theme of
the sermon was, "If a man die,
shall he live again?" The re
mams were laid away in the
new public cemetery, south of
town.

Spring Beef
Will be High
D. W. Raymond Says Soft
Corn in Middle East Hm
Demoralized Feeders
The Montana stockman who
is wintering cattle to market as
spring beef, and who has good
feed, will make a killing, in the
opinion of D. W. Raymond, sec
retary of the state board of
stock commissioners, who has
just returned from Chicago.
During the past six weeks
there have been extraordinarily
heavy runs of medium weight
cattle and light hogs on the Chi
cago market, from those districts
which heretofore have engaged
extensively in winter feeding
for the February and March
market.
"I met many of the Chicago
commission men as well as the
shippers," said Mr. Raymond.
"They informed me that the
runs are due to the soft corn.
In practically all the corn coun
try northward from a line fifty
miles south of Chicago, the corn
is soft. It is milky, the cattle
don't like it, and instead of
making the customary gains in
many instances they weigh less
than when they were placed on
feed.
"All at once feeders awaken
ed to a realization of the condi
tion that confronted them. They
began dumping their cattle on
the market, as well as the hogs
which they had counted on f at
teniotf after the steers. This
accounts for the demoralization
of both the cattle and hog mar
kets at the present time.
As a rtsuJt of this condition
the buyers will be unable to ob
tain their supply of spring beef
from their customary sources
and must look elsewhere.
"Montana feeders should reap
the benefit of the scarcity that
is bound to prevail. Informa
tion received by this office,
however, is that only from one
half to two-thirds as many cat
tle are being fed in the state as
last year. Many Montana feed
ers lost money on their opera
tions last year and the year be
fore. This is one reason why
fewer cattle are being fed. An
other is that in some parts of
the state the hay crop was
spoiled. A third reason is be
cause bankers who were carry
ing some of the feeders in pre
vious years absolutely declined
to advance a dollar for the pur*
chase of any cattle costing over
six cents a pound. The cattle
were not to be had at this price."
