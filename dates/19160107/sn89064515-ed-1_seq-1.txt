Towns Asked to Co-operate
4 George W. Cooley, state engineer of
the highway commission has written
letters to the commercial clubs in

to appoint com
'•y mittees to crvstalize sentiment for the
completion of the road. The state en

1 marked and in good shape by 1917.
Road Passes Fine Scenery
'"The fact that we have good roads
"built or building to Itasca park, is for
tunate," Mr. Cooley said today. Au
tomobile tourists passing over the Jef
ferson highway will see some magnifi
cent scenery and get a glimpse oi the
source of the Mississippi. The course
of the road through this state will be
3500 miles in length and will include
the most beautiful portion of the high

HfSTAZ«LED AT CITY HALL

The city council held a regular mee!&
ing' at the city hall Monday evening?
Aldermen Hall, LaFond, Peterson,
Venners and Murphy were present.
Bids were- opened for a road, grrfdeK
but after some discussion as to
fairness of allowing the contract, for
a grader under tie circumstances^ Kll
bids were rejected. Later on the coun'
cil will again' advertise for bids fot^a
machine of this kind. E. F. Brown,
who represented the Austin-Western
Grader company, protested against j/fle
purchase of a machine on .competitive
bids, as he said it was not a fair d«il
to him, because he had already ma^e
the city an offer and stated his^price.
Two other grader representatives were
present and told of the merits of their
machines. Stireet Commissioner La
Fond stated that he had examined the
grader offered for sa.le by Mr. Brown
and had found that it was not suita
ble for grading streets, in the city a^d
that the blade was patched on each
end to make it measure 12 feet. He
stated that a auick-lift grader wowd
be. the pro'pei* |itind for the city to .pur
chase, as the time lost in raising the
cutting blade, at crossings, is too
igreat. vV"..
-Street Commissioner LaFond was i.Ur
structed.» to get all necessary equip
ment -fc^ use in recovering the bodies
of persons drowned here, such as grap
pling hooks, chains^ipoles, etc. and to
place it, with the lungmotor, at .the
city hall, where it would be available
at all times. The Pine Tree Manufac
turing company, and the Hennepin. Par,
per company may also put in equip-,
ment of this kind. Fire Chief Emder
announced that he would arrange- to
have the city custodian give a bell ^ig
nal in event of a case of drowning}. to.
get help. He stated that the signal
would be six taps of the bell at the
city hall two times at short intervals.
The lifesaving equipment will be kept
at the city hall.
Upon motion of Alderman LaFont
Street Commissioner Isaac LaFonc.
was authorized to clean the ice on- th^.
Tiver north of the Broadway yrggbh

some fast horses have promised l$iat
if .the track is clearied they will- ar
range for some good races here«this
winter.

BEFUSAL TO WITHDRAW AS
A CANDIDATE
Washington, Jan. 6.—All efforts to
persuade Representative Lindbergh to
withdraw from the race for governor
of Minnesota will prove unavailing,
according to statement' by hjjn%to«
day.
Information that iM. Mffiruson of
Minneapolis was coming here in an at
tempt to persuade Mr. Lindbergh to
withdraw from the race was called to,
the Little Falls man's attention.
Determined to Bpn
"You may say for me that I can
foresee" nothing that would ihduce me
to give'up'my plan of making a cam
paign in Minnesota for tne governor
ship, -he said.
"As I have said before, I have a
plan of 'government to present rather
than a personal ambition to satisfy,.
and it was to present this plan ,to, the
people of Minnesota that I first deter
mined to enter the tmbernatorial race
Has Plan for State
"It seems to me the plan can be
presented" best by making a campaign
for governor. I shall make that cam
paign," coine what will."
Mr. Martinson had not seen Repre
sentative Lindbergh up to late to
night.
A. J. Fenn left yesterdav afternoon
for Kimballj called there bv the death
of his uncle, William Arrowood, which
occurred Wednesday afternoon at 2
o'clock, from Bright's disease. The
funeral is to be held at 2 o'clock this
afternoon.
County Auditor MeNairy. yesterday
sent out twenty-two warrants for wolf
bounty, which had been registered
prior to January 1.. .He was .advised ?t
by the attorney general to issue the
warrants, and he must assume that
the county will be reimbursed by the
state for the amount paid out. It is
not likely that the county treasurer
.will redeem-the warrants, however, at
least at this time.
