Senator Borah asked Senator Wil

SUBJECT OF
General Ian Hamilton's Re
port of Campaign in East is
Published in the Gazette
Is Excellent History.
SULVA BAY LANDING
COMMENTED UPON
Commander Pays High Trib
ute to Bravery of Troops
and Tells of the Debarka
tion Fiasco" in August
LONDON. Jan. 6. General Ian
Hamilton's report of the British
operations on Gallipoli Peninsula
was published in the official Gaz
ette tonight. It tells the story of
tbe fighting on the pen!nsula from
the beginning of May to the mid
dle of October. ' '
The Sulva Bay landing failed
to accomplish its object, the re
' port shows, partly because the
force consisted largely of untried
troops under generals inexperienc
ed in the new warfare and partly
through the failure of the water
supply. The sufferings of the
troops for lack of water make pain
ful reading. Hamilton bebtytfs tbe
highest praise upo$ the bravery of
the men. He believes that after
" the middle of August- the Turks
outnumbered the British and had
plenty of fresh soldiers and muni
tions while the British government
was unable to furnish him the re
inforcements wanted.
Probably no more Important con
tribution to the history of the
present war has as yet been made.
The report throws light on. the.
great landing at Anzac Cove and
Sulva Bay, August 7, which has
1 been the subject of strong attacks
upon tbe military administration.
The whole operations required the
combined action of the army and .
navy. Tbe handling of masses of
troops within a limited area was
probably the mos.t complicated ev
er undertaken. Military men are
not surprised that some of the im
portant details failed to work out
as planned.
A general strongly opposed the
abandonment of any bases held
by the British troops. The most
stirring passages describe the ill
fated landing at Sulva Bay and
Anzac early in August for secur
ing the command of tbe heights
on the middle of the peninsula and
cutting the Turks from their base.
This operation began August " 6
and the climax was reached at
daybreak of the tenth when the
Turks made a grand attack from
tbe summit of the hill upon a
short front held by two battalions
which Hamilton describes as
weakened in numbers though not
in spirit.
"At first our men were shelled '
by every enemy gun," he says,
"then assaulted by a huge column
consisting of no less than a full
division plus three battalions. The
British simply were overwhelmed
in their shallow trenches by the
sheer weight of numbers, while
those who were out in the open.'
literally were almost annihilated."

KERmEEN SANITY
QUESTION IS
UNSETTLED
Wiley Jones Asks Former Dis
trict Attorney and Court for
Their Opinions on the Re
sponsibility of Condemned.
TOMBSTONE. Jan. . (Special)
Judging from telegrams received here
during the past twenty-four hours a i
effort is being made to still question
the sanity of V. W. Kermeen, who is
sentenced to behung at the state
prison at Florence tomorrow between
the hours of ten a?id four o'clock.
The following telegram was received
yesterday by former County Attorney
W. G.- Gilmore, from Wiley Jones,
the attorney general of tbe state and
a member of the pardon board:
"Wire night letter giving opinion or
Kermeen sanity."
The following is the reply sent by
Mr. Gilmore to Mr. Jones:
"Measured by every legal standard
I have always regarded W. W. KKer-
meen as absolutely sane. The murder
was surely commercial. He fled from
the scene, not only of the crime fori
which convicted, but for another self j tion there. This is considered oppor
confessed one. He always seemed tof tune in view of the forthcoming cam-
i realize tho eiiomiitv of his rnlM
; since he appearea- a8 8ane and acfe,,t
! as a sane man. I always regarded and!
i deaIt with him." ,
Judge Lock wood was in receipt of j
la similar telegram from the attorney I
J general and responded as follows:
I "In my opinion Kermeen is perfect
ly cognizant mentally of the differ
i ence' between right and wrong and
i his duty to society, but is lacking in
the feeling of moral responsibility
and restrained only by fear of physic-
i m uuuisiinii-ui. uu um nun lie

j There were never any actions on
the part of Kermeen .while he was
In the county Jail here that showed
the least sign of insanity and since
he has been in the prison at Flor
ence he has
written letters back

of nsnity. While here he confessed
; t0 Sheriff Wheeler to the killing' of;
I wnmai near RedHlnsr. California,
and told how the murder tbeer was
' committed, which roinceded with the
facts that were sent here bv tbe of
ficers' in that county. He signed
written ' statements : regarding the
killing of Harrel-and also wrote let
ters to his mother in Nevada about
his case that certainly tailed to show
any sisns of insanity. It is under
stood that Kermeen now denies that
he ever made any confession to
Sheriff Wheeler about the killinir of
the woman of the under-world at Red
ding. Whether or not the prison board
will take any further action remains
to be seen during the next twenty
four hours, as all reports from Phoe
nix so far have stated that they.would
not take any further action.

Proposed Offensive of Teu

LONDON, January 6. The area of
Russian successes over the Teutons in
the east continues to widen. Although
the situation around Czernowitz has
not cleared officially it appears from
Russian sources, the Austrias are hard
pressed over a long line of defenses.
The Austrians are throwing huge re
inforcements into the district, t is
expected the Russians will strike the
j Kalomea-Stanislau-Nalicz line where
powerful defensive works have been
in preparation for some time by the
Teutons.
Meanwhile the Russians' position.
250 miles aorth. on the middle Styr
river is greatly strengthened by the
successful operations in that region of
the great marshes where the Russians
are beginning to emerge.
Tlreir advance here has not been
the result of isolated battle but of a
series of engagements lasting a con
siderable! period..
. The entente capitals express the
opinion that tbe Russian offensive has
completely upset the plans of the Teu
tons for an invasion of Saloniki, and
Egypt. In connection with yester
day's announcement of tbe defeat of
a German war vessel on Lake Tang
anyika, East Central Africa, and half
a mile above sea level, it was an
nounced that the British ships which
accomplished the defeat were espec
ially constructed in England, and
transported to the heart of Africa. I'n

mans dominated the lake. The pres-

of Commons whether a considerable
part of the Serbian army was in dis-
tress at Scutari, and whether England
had offered the Serbians a suitable
locality in the Mediterranean wher
they could rest and recuperate. Lord
Cecil, under scretary of foreign affairs
said the Serbians at Scutari at first
had been in great distress, but the sit
uation was largely r?::eved. He was
not willing to make an announcement
concerning the latter part of the ques

' bian refugees in Greek territory now

and are at Saloniki.

; The government held the bulk of the
liberal and conservative vote. Irish
nationalists supported the measure.
The ounionists opposed the bill.
The Announcement of the final re

tremendous cheering. Scores of mem-
