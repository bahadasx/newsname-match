when they left home Monday morn
ing. The lista for those towns went i
out from hero Friday afternoon nnd i
oven In the circuitous route ought
to have been delivered Saturday
morntng. In these dnye of rush and
hurry, we ought to have a quicker
service and could bare if the cltlsen
shfp of Scurry county had whnt they
are entitled to. The Siipat contains
matter of Interest and business con
concern every week for the usb
sortbers at Ira and Dunn and wltb di
rect route from Snyder to those two
towns the paper wouli reach them on
Friday and they would gt the county
news fresh fronj the press. As It now
Is, they can't get it till neit dayand
some times for three days.
Now If every point were not In
faror of this mail going out from
Snyder Instead of from Colorado, we
wouldn't so strongly Insist, but In this
ase there is mil a linn of argument
in favor of the Colorado ronte. Rvery
piece of malt sent out on that star
ruute from Colorado la delivered in
Scurry comity. Then again wllh the

In by carl?

nnd those of Hje Smith part of (he

ar.ej ofifn loser because of lack of
quick communication. At least K
per cent of the people want a chnngc
