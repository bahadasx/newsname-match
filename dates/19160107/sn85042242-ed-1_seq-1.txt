prosperous condition attending the
steel and iron trade, the finance com­
mittee of the United States Steel cor­
poration, acting on the recommenda­

LABOR PARTY HOSTILE
TO ASQUITH'S MEASURE
Organized Labor Will Fight Bill
in House of Commons in Effort
to Kill It.
London, Jan. G.—Midst scenes of
wild enthusiasm the house of com­
mons tonight' passed on first reading
the bill for compulsory military ser­
vice by the decisive vote of 4015 to
10.r».
The vote seems to presage the pas­
sage of the bill
The vote came shortly before mid­
night with the galleries again packed.
Every seat on the floor of the house
was occupied. The ministerial bench­
es were filled and an air or eager ex­
pectancy prevailing.
A. J. Balfour, first lord of the ad­
miralty, closed the debate in behalf
,of the government and lu did it in a
persuasive appeal of half an hour,
which roused the lagging spirit of the
advocates of the bill and turned the
tide of adversity which had been run­
ning steadily against, the measure
throughout the debates and outside
the events of the day.
Daiing With Realities,
"Let this vote tonight, show that we
are a united people," was his closing
appeal. "abandon your abstract,
theories and remember we are deal­
ing v/ith' stern realities which call for
gre».l sacrifices.'
Then came the vule. Tlie an­
nouncement of the figures was re­
ceived with outburst of cheering.
Scores of members in kaliki waved
their handkerchiefs and the air was
rent with white papers -Hung- in tri­
umph at the government's success.
Jm.iiaitfysis showed that, the gov­
ernment field the bulk of the Liberal
vote. The Irish Nationalists had vol
c,d against the bill, but the .Irish
Unionists supported the measure.
London, Jan. 6.—The conscription
bill passed the first reading in the
house of-commons tonight by a vote
of 403 to 105.
Arthur Henderson, president of the
board of education and leader of the
Labor party, in the house of com­
mons, William Brace, parliamentary
under-secretary for home affairs, and
George H. Roberts, lord commission­
er of the treasury, also Labor, party
leaders, have resigned from the min­
istry.
Labor Opposes Bill.
Organized labor of Great Britain,
sitting in conference in London, to­
day decided against the government's
compulsion bill 'by the overwhelming
majority of 1,I'98,0C0 votes to 7S:j,000.
Hostility to the government's meas­
ure was uncoinpromising and necessi­
tated the resignation from the coali­
tion ministry of all three labor mem­
bers, Arthur Henderson, William
Brace and George (H. Roberts.
In addition to the formal vote
against the government's compulsion
bill, the congress rejected, by 4 to I.
a motion pledging support to the com­
pulsion bill for single men, and pass­
ed, by 2 to 1, another motion direct­

REPORT ON THE
DARDANELLES
British Commander Recalled in
Praises British Troop*..
General Hamilton bestdws the high­
est praise upon the bravery qf thla
men. He believes that after the
middle of August.' the Turiur out-
wiuie
ul at Copenhagen atld
the British governmefat
able to furnish the reinforcements he
.wan&d. The general strongly •op­
posed the abandonment of any bases
ncld by the British troops.
General Hamilton's report, which
was, submitted to Field Marshall E«fl
Kitchencr, secretary of state :for -waj,
carries ihe story of tho Dardanelles
operation, up to mid-October, when
he relinquished his command. Con*
cerning his retirement, General Ham­
ilton reports:
Recalled In October.
"On the 11th of October, your lord­
ship cabled asking for an estimate of
the losses which would be involved
in vhe evacuation of the peninsula. I
replied in terms showing that such a
step was to me unthinkable. On the
16th of October I received a Cabl^,
recalling me to London for the reason
as I was informed by your lordship
on my arrival, that His Majesty's gov­
ernment desired fresh, unbiased opin­
ion from a responsible commander
upon the question of early $.vacua
tion."
Woman Spy Caught.
A court martial has sentenced t»
death Maria Jose dei Pasi, 25 years
old." a naturalized Argentinan, who
was convicted of sending military in­
formation from Marseilles and Paris
to German agents.
Pursued By Submarine.
A Havaas dispatch from Marseilles
says the .French steamship, Canarak,
with a large number of passengers on
board has arrived from Alexandria
and Malta, having been pursued for
hours Monday by a submarine.
The passengers slept all night In
the saloon after putting on life belts.
Russians Move On.
The area of Russian successes over
the German forces in the east con­
tinue ro widen.
The Russians here are expected to
strike at the Kolomea-Stanislau-H&l
icz line, where powerful defensive
works have been in preparation for
some time by the Austro-Germans.
Meanwhile the Russian position -250
miles further north on the middle
Styre river, has been greatly streng­
thened by successful operation in the
region of the great marshes, where
the Russians are beginning to emerge
from the marshes.
The interest in the fate of Serbia's
refugee army was shown by the qtteis
tions asked in the house of commons
today: "Whether a considerable put
of the Serbian army is in distress at
Scutari and whether His Majesty'*
government will offer the Serbian
army some suitable locality, in tha
Mediterranean, where the men may
rest and recuperate."
Serbians In Distress.
In reply Lord Robert Cecil, under­
secretary for foreign affairs, said
there was a considerable body tf
the Serbian army at Scutari when
the Trten had been in great distress,
but the situation, he added, h«d BMT
been largely relieved. Telegrams
from Athens says that the number of
refueees in Greek territory is now
40,000 of whom 6.000 are at SsUiBiki.

London, Jan. 6.—General Hamil­
ton's reporl on the British operations
on tho Gallipoli peninsula was pub­
lished in the'Gazette tpnight. It tells
the story of the fighting on the penin­
sula from the beginning o( May to
thejniddle of October.
Probably no more important' contri-'
bution to the history of the present
war has yet bef*n made. The report
throws light An ..the great landing, at
Anzae cove ar^d "Hubla. bay August 7,
which has been the subject of strong
attacks upon the military administra­
tion of the government, the whoiw
operation'requiring the combined ac­
tion «f the army and the navy.-
Plans All Failed.
The handling of the masses of
troops within a limited area .probably
was the most complicated ever un­
dertaken. land military men are not
surprised that some important details
failed' to work out, as planned.
The Subla bay landing failed tb ac
compllsh its object, the report shows,
partly because the fdrce consisted
largely of untried iroopr
erals inexperienced in the new war­
fare and partly becaufeq of failure of
the water supply. The sufferiiigs pf
the troops for water, make painful
leading.
