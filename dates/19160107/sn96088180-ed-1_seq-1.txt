Portland, Jan. 7. Thousands of
people In Germany are getting barely
enough food to live on, according to
Mrs. 8tanlslaw Miller, who baa just
arrived here from Posen, Germany.
Soldiers often go several days with
out bread, she says. Mra. Miller had
some difficulty getting out of Ger
many. She was detained at the bor
der, and a woman accompanying her
was not allowed to leave the country
because she carried one thousand
marks In gold.1: In Copenhagen sbe
was again searched, this time by Dan
ltu soldiors, Airs. Miller said. The
liner v United ; States, on which she
crossed the Atlantic, waa -buffeted by
the ,, same , storm which shook the
peace ship Oscar II, The ablp was
overhauled and detained four days
by a British battleship near Chris
ttanla, aald Mrs. Miller.

FROM FAILURE IN
THE DARDAHELLES
London, Jsn. 7. The whole Dar
danellea expedition failure may be
Investigated, it ( waa reported today,
as a result of Oencral Ian Hamilton's
report. General Stopford has de
manded that the war office Immedl

nounced.
England bad beard rumors of the
startling nature of Hamilton's report,
but when the full Import of the mes
sage dawned upon them today there
waa consternation, mingled In many
places with anger.
Hamilton laid the failure of the
expedition to tho fact that he waa not
glveu , rolnforcements at critical
times, that some of his men and of
ficers were not sufficiently trained,
and last, but not least, to the dtsor-
gsnlsed manner In which th water
aupply waa arranged. His picture
of men lapping the beads ot water
from the bags ot liquid the mules
carried furnished a truly pathetic
picture. :
General Stoptord'a request for In
vestigation supposedly, 1s based on
Hamilton's report that he lacked sup
port, and more particularly . on his
statement that Stoptord'a disinclina
tion to make frontal attacks waa the
"root of our failure to make use of

August 8." .-.

Berlin, Jan. 7. Germany, It Is be

the Sues, but lnatead will rely on
Turks,, officered by Germans and sup

Authorities point 1 out that the
Turks now have more than 1,000.-

will soon be thoroughly equipped for
campaigning. v
German officers who have lived In
Egypt and understand the problema

the Invaders. It Is now possible to
send supplies to Constantinople, and
thence to Damascus, faster than ever,

Had the judge replaced the tem

have appealed ' Immediately to the
supreme court, which has already up
held the old statute several times.,

the Judge to put the crusher on the

from that action.
Baseball fans were elated over the

Since the decision of the federal
court," said Judge Gantenbeln, "I am
convinced that the law la constitu

a majority of the people do not want

the statute books for more than 50
years and there is no reason why It
