the Funeral.
MOURNED BY ENTIRE NATION
Council Bluffs paused yesterday
and paid silent tribute to the mem- j
ory of General Grenville M. Dodge. '
All business and social functions
were suspended during the afternoon I
and thousands of persons stood In !
the chill winter air as living walls
between which the cortege passed.
When the artillery caisson bearing
the casket reached the cemetery the
last automobiles were being loaded
at the Dodge residence, more than
two miles away. For the greater
part of the distance both sides of the
streets traversed were lined with
people.
When the cortege arrived at the
cemetery thousands of persons had
gathered there. Guards kept open
the route in the cemetery and pre
vented massing around the grave.
There was no confusion. It was a
military funeral and all moved with
military precision. All of the major
details had been planned by General
Dodge himself and there was no de
viation. Brigadier General Lincoln
of Governor Clarke's staff and com
mander of the Iowa militia, said it
was undoubtedly the largest funeral,
witnessed by the largest number of
people, ever held In Iowa.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 6. Senator
Martine's resolution asking the pres
ident to set aside a day as Jewish
relief day for Jewish war sufferers
was adopted today after Chairman
Stone of the foreign relations com
mittee had said that while he ap
proved such a cause in relation to
the Poles and Jews, whom, he paid,
were without a government of their
, own. he hoped it would not extend to
f any of the organized nations.

Senator Fall declared:
"I have never known of a time before
when any president has dared Ignore the
congress of the United .Slates. It has
been Ignored by the present occupant of
the White House.
Senator lxdge urged adoption of the
resolution.
"Is our ambassador," he asked, "to go
to Mexico City, where Carrang has not
gone, or will he follow the flitting camp
of the first chief wherever it goes? Re
cently,, not only In Mexico, but elsewhere,
our government has adopted a plan of
dealing through furtive agents of a per
sonal nature.
"I think It ofobably desirable, however,
that we have a leeogntzed ambassador in
Mexico to look after the Americana who
remain unmurdered thjere and fragments
of property that are left, but I think we
should be informed officially by the presi
dent regarding the government to which
he is to be assigned."
Senator John Sharp Williams In the
course of the debate asserted the right of
self-government was inseparable from
the "right of self-misgovernment."
"Mexican affairs cannot be settled by

OMAHA GOOD SITE
FOR ARMY SCHOOL
Congressman Shallenberger Says
He Will Urge Location Here
if Choice is Made.
ALSO FINE FOR AN ARSENAL
'
(From a Staff Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6. (Special
Telegram.) Before the military af
fairs committee of the house of rep
resentatives, of which ex-Governor
Sballenberger Is a member and
chairman of the subcommittee deal
ing with arsenals, barracks and
grounds, the departmental bill for
the increase of the army was under
consideration today. While the bill
In its general provisions was under
discussion two propositions came up
for extended consideration, namely
the need of schools other than West
Point for the training of young of
ficers and the location or arsenals
and storage depots other than those
already established.
Representative Shallenherger, who took
the liveliest positive Interest In upbuild
ing the militia when governor pf Ne
braska,, said .: to ..The . J3ce ...porreBpondent
todayj .
"Omaha la most splendidly located for
a school patterned after, and along; the
lines of West Point, and should the
bill now under consideration become a
law, I would certainly favor the loca
tion of a military school In the metropolis
of my state.
"Fort Omaha is Ideally located for a
school of military instruction, suoh as
the committee 1 now considering. It
has a geographical location that Is splen
did, and Is reached by a network of rail
roads of the very first Importance.
"But there 1 another subject receiving
tho very serious consideration of the
committee and that la the establishment
of government arsenal and armor plate
manufactories where war munition could
be made more economically than by pri
vate plants.
"Outside of Rock Island our arsenals
and storage depots for war munitions are
located on our two seaboards and, there
fore, easy of access to invader from
either ocean. Omaha, for the ara reason
that applies to the location of a military
school at that point, la equally well sit
uated for an arsenal or a great supply
depot and if the government is going to
create additional schools for the training
of young offloer or is going to erect ad
ditional arsenal for the manufacture of
the munition of war, I shall Insist that
Omaha Is an Ideal location for either
project."

SOLDIERS CHOKE THEIR FOES '
LONDON, .Ian. 11. General Ian
Hamilton's report on the British op
crat'ons on the Galllpolt peninsula
was published In the tiffidal Ga
Kflle tonluht. It tells tli, story of
the fighting on the penu.sula from
(he boalnnlnR of May to the middle
of Oclober.
The Suxla hay landing failed to
accomplish Its object, the report
shows, partly because the force con
sisted largely of untrained troops
under generals inexperienced in the
new warfare, and partly through the
failure of the water supply. The
sufferings of tbe troops for lack of
water make painful reading.
Throws Light on Laadlnc
Probably no more Important contribu
tion to the history of the present war
yet has been made. The report throws
light on the great landing at Ansae rove
and Suvla bay August 7, which has been
the subject of strong sttaeks upon the
military administration of tho govern
ment, the whole operations requiring the
combined action of the army and th
navy.
The handling of the masses of troop
within a limited area probably was the
.most complicated ever undertaken, and
the military men are surprised thst some
Important details failed to work out as
planned.
Oeneral Hamilton bestows the highest
possible praise upon the bravery of the
men. ne believes that after the middle
of August the Turks outnumbered the
British and had plenty of fresh soldiers
and munitions, while the British gov
ernment was unable to furnish him with
the reinforcements he wanted.
The general strongly opposed the aban
donment of any of the bases held by the
British troops.
Sabmltterf to Kitchener.
General Hamilton report which w
submitted to Field Marshal Earl Kitch
ener, secretary of state for war, carries
th story of the Dardanelles operations
up to mld-Octobnr, when be relinquished;
his command. Concerning hi retirement
General Hamilton reports:
"On October 11 your lordship cabled
asking me for an estimate of th losses
which", would be Involved In the evacua
tion of the peninsula. I replied In term
showing that such a step waa to me un
thinkable. On October IS I received a
cable recalling me to London for the rea
son, as I waa Informed by your lordship
on my arrival, that his majesty's gov
ernment desired fresh, unbiased opinion
from a responsible commander upon the
question of early evacuation."
The most stirring passages of the doc
ument describe the Ill-fated landing at
Suvla Bay and Ansao early In August for
securing command of the height on the
middle of the peninsula and cutting off
from their base the Turkish forces at
the lower extremity where the entente
allied army made their first landing.
Climax at Daybreak.
This operation began on Augusts. The
climax wss reported at daybreak on the
