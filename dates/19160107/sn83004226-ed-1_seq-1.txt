EVANGELISTIC SERVICES
IN IL E. TORCH, SOUTH
REV. McELDOWNEY BEGAN IN
TERESTING REVIVAL MEET.
ING 8UNDAY EVENING.
A series of evangelistic services was
Inaugurated at the M. E. Church, South,
last Sunday evening under the conduct
of the pastor, the Rev. L. E. McEldown-
ey, assisted by the Rev. Marvin row
ell and wife, singers. Quite unexpected
to most of his congregation Mr. Mo
Kldowney said at the opening of the
morning service that these meetings
would begin at the evening services.
He said the time waa auspicious anl
that ho could not have been more for
tunate in the time for the met-tlng Mr.
and Mrs. Powell, who have much bu'.c
as evangelistic singers, hid 'Jen here
before and won the hearts of all who
heard them sing their sweet songs. He
further said that he had secured their
help for at least three weeks. Accord
ing to. program, the meeting did begin
Sunday evening preceded by an able
sermon delivered in his usual forcible
way by Mr. McEldowney. : lYeceding
the sermon a choir augmented by the
presence of several volunteers and led
by Mr. Powell, entered heartily into the
work of the occasion and added much
to the interest of the meeting. Th'.s
chok- Is composed of the choir of the
M. E. Church, South, and helpful vol
unteers of the other churches, in this
city. They showed almost Immediate
ly the effect of the skillful conductor-
ship of their leader who, has a-way of
getting his choir members to do Just as
he wants them to do and he wants them
to do well. During thj cervices M-.
and Mrs. Powell sang, as they also did
at the morning services, some vers I
beautiful duets, their fine tenor and
contralto voices blending harmoniously.
Their singing will be an especial fea
ture of the remaining meetings of the
series. These meetings proimxe to be
very successful; In fact a revival of re
ligion seemed to be "on" Sun-In y even
lng. Deep feeling had been manifested
throughout . the entire services and
when the minister, at the close' made a
call for those who were willing to help
In the meeting very many In the great
congregation come and by shaking
hands with the minister declared their
willingness to help, and following this
manifestation Mr. McEldowney called
for those who desired to be helped.
Many heeded the invitation and show
ed by going forward that they were In
deed in earnest. Sunday niglw the con
gregation was a very large one, every
Inch of the seating capacity being used
even tho aisles being full of chairs. In
terest in this evangelistlo demonstra
tion continues and continues to In
crease. All denominations show their
interest In the meetings by their pres
ence. Mr. McEldowney goes at this
business, if one may use this expres
sion, In a very masterful way and has
his meetings well under hand, seeming
to know the right thing to do and he
certainly does it . -
Day time prayer meetings are by no
means new in the conducting of revi
vals in Louisa. These are held by the
women every day in the Interest of the
present meetings, but In ' a manner
somewhat different from the prevail
ing customs. They are held in the
mornings from 9:30 to 10, and at each
evening service it Is announced where
the next day's will be. Three are held
at the same hour in different parts of
the city and quite unexpectedly the at
tendance upon these Is very large and
at each of them much Interest and feel
ing are shown. The men's prayer
meetings and tho young people's are
being considered. Altogether the out
look for a great religious awakening In
Louisa Is very good. To furnish in
strumental music for such meetings as
these it was deemed best to supplant
tho organ by a piano. This has been
done and under the good playing of
Mrs. O. R. Vinson excellent music is
being made.

OHIO RIVER
SAYS OPTIMISM
CRIPS COUNTRY
BUSINESS OUTLOOK IN STRIK
ING CONTRAST TO THAT
' OF 1916. '-.
Washington, Jan. 2. That the out
look for better business for the first
four months of 1916 Is In striking con
trast to that prevailing this time last
year is the opinion expressed in a re
port published to-day by the Commit
tee on Statistics and Standards of the
Chamber of Commerce of the United
States. There are localities where
much caution and conservatism yet re
main, and the influence of high prices
for the future further accentuates this
caution because dealers feel that high
prices will curtail buying by the con
sumer. "Broadly speaking" the reports states
"it may be said that the spirit of optim
ism and hopefulness prevails to a de
gree that has not been apparent for
nearly a decade and the general belief
and expectation is for such prosperity
during 1916 as will recompense the peo
ple of this country for all their past
misfortunes."
Referring specifically to conditions
caused by the European war the re
port of this committee, of which A. W.
Douglas, of St Louis, is chairman,
says
"The adverse effect of the confllpt In
Europe still prevails in some sections,
though to a very much less extent than
at this time lost year. There are still
scattered fears of the possibility of this
country being involved In the gigantic
strife; but, as against this, the large
portion of the people are paying less
and less attention to the war and more
ar.d more are concentrating their
thoughts and efforts on domestic mat
ters. Beyond this is the striking fact
that the influence of the war at pres
ent as a whole is more favorable than
adverse, because of the tremendous im
petus it has given to certain lines of
manufacturing, especially east of the
Alleghanies, and likewise to many ag
ricultural products, while there are
many conjectures as to the consequent
effect upon .business of such a contln
Kency, the general belief centers around
tho conviction that the war will last for
some time and that the part of wis
dom is to make the most of the pres
ent situation, regrettable as It is, and
not take undue thought of the morrow
by attempting to forecast the likeli
hood of what will happen if peace is
declared, since there seems to be no
stable analogies nor precedents' on
which to base a sound opinion. The
unfavorable effects on some industries
have largely been overcome by time
and the Ingenuity of tho manufactur
ers, but certain other lines of business
still languish because of the continu
ance of the war."
, Railroads . report better business as a
whole and railroad shops are employ
ing more and more men. Manufactur
ing has taken on new life through the
while country and In almost every
branch. Abnormal activities prevail
largely in the East and in certain por
tions of the Central West because of
heavy orders from abroad for war pur
poses. This has created a iemporary
lack of raw material In many lines not
otherwise affected by war orders. There
is much consequent decrease in unem
ployment Prices are being advanced
everywhere by manufacturers in all
lines and they are continually being
flooded with orders. Automobile factor
ies and flour mills are exceedingly busy.
This is likewise true of potteries, ce
ment factories and furniture.
While money is plentiful and rates
generally are not high, there is a wide
difference in the ease or lack of ease
with which it can be obtained, and this
difference seems to be largely due to
local conditions. As a whole, however,
it is not difficult to get money from the
banks on good collateral for legitimate
purposes. Collections vary from poor
to good and as a rule average fair.
Merchandise stocks In the hands of
the retailers vary from light to normal.
Orders for future shipments In the
spring are being more generally placed
than for some years past thus show
lng the confidence of the dealers in the
Immediate future.
Crop yields in general, other than cot
ton, exceed those of any year known In
our history. This is especially true of
the small grains as a whole, and par
ticularly of all of the forage crops
which are in abundance beyond prece
dent This latter fact Is one that is
most significant and of very large mo
ment to the country as a whole. It Is
of the utmost value and Important to
tho farmer to have cheap and abun
dant feed for his livestock through the
coming winter, and this state of affairs
at present exists as one of the stable
foundations for that. commercial pros
perity which seems definitely to have
arrived.
The quality of the corn crop Is, as a
rule, below the average In the most
northern territories, and generally very
good throughout the South, where it
was raised this year to an extent nev
er known before.
Conditions In 8outh. -
Because of the unusual diversifica
tions In the South during 1915, there
resulted the largest grain and forage
crops of all descriptions known in the
history of thnt section. There arc also
more hogs, cattle and dulry cows In the

foundation In all agricultural and ln-annUul output estimate. Tt.e total es
dustrlal ways. The optimistic spirit of , tlmiited outnut of the mmntrv ,i,iH,,u-
; the people as regards the future Is
shown in the great revival of business
throughout that section, and the gen
eral opinion that the South has enter
ed on a period of lasting prosperity. As
far as is possible to forecast, It seems ;
more than probable that the system of
diversification will be permanent and
that there will be more grain and food
stuffs raised in proportion to cotton in
the future. The oil and gas industries
have experienced a revival because of
much higher prices.
There is more livestock in the coun
try at this time than for the same time
last year, despite the unfavorable con
ditions reported in certain sections In
the Northwest
The lumber business of the United
States which has seemed dead for sev
eral years, according to the Nation.il
chamber report, appears only to have
been sleeping. It is Improving slowly
throughout the entire country, but es
pecially in the yellow-pine district of
the South. This Is due to Increased .
orders for exports and to buying by
railroads and car companies. It is ex
pected that during the spring there will
set in buying for homes, and a general
revival of business throughout the
country-especially outside of the large
cities is looked for during the first six
months of the coming year. Of all the
so-called barometers of business, ac
cording to the authority quoted above,
there are none so truly indicative of
general prosperity as building. It is
usually the last Industry . to feel the
impulse of better times, but its activi
ties embrace so many lines of business
that this effect is general throughout
the country.

rather, old field, is coming to life with
remarkable vigor and has furnished
some of the sensational strikes of the
past few weeks. The latest producer

reached a point to Justify the re-establishment
of a market.

the yield of Estill county. A pipe line
has been completed from the main de
velopment to a railroad loading sta

put will be shipped to one of the main
stations of the trunk pipe line leading
from the lower Kentucky fields to tho
