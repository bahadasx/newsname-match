HOLBROOK, NAVAJO COUNTY,
NA, FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 1916.
LOCAL AND GENERAL NEWS
Some of It May Interest You; All
Of It Is Worth a Perusal
Vote the Bonds Next Tuesday
Next Tuesday, January 11, the
taxpayers of Navajo countv will
decide the question whether or
not the county shall incur a
bonded indebtedness of $63.000
for the purpose of building and
repairing bridges in the county. .
The News believes that the
bonds should be yoted. In the
first place, it is generally admit
ted that the bridges are needed.
The board of supervisors, com
plying with a petition of the tax
payers, called the election. More
over, each member of the board
is a good business man, and each
personally favors the bond issue.
The fact that the members of
the board of supervisors, men of
sound business judgment, and
men, who by reason of their offi
cial positions are more competent
than others to judge of the
merits of the proposition, strong
ly favor voting the bonds, should
be sufficient reason for others to
vote in favor of the bonds.
We understand that the argu
ment has been advanced by
some who are opposed to the
bond issue, that the bridges can
not be built for the amount call-
ed for $63,000. Mr. Perkins
the county engineer, made care
ful estimates of the cost of the
different bridges, and he states
positively that the monev asked
for in the bond election is suffi
cient. His estimates have been
examined by the engineer of the
Santa Fe railroad, who was
taken over the ground by Mr.
Perkins, and these estimates were
confirmed by him. They must
therefore he correct, and the ar
gument that the amount of money
is not sufficient consequently
falls to the ground.
The argument that a larger
issue should have been called for
which would cover the cost of
improving the roads as well as
the bridges is trivial. A good
dispositioned housewife does not
refuse the hungry man bread
because she has only a half loaf.
She gives him the half loaf and
builds a fire to bake more bread
By the same token the progres
sive taxpayer should vote the
bonds for the bridges, and start
at once to plan for an additional
issue of bonds to cover road
building. When the bridges are
built, the need of better roads
leading to the bridges will be
come more emphasized, and more
bonds can be easily voted.
We believe that nothing helps
so much to build up a country as
good roads and bridges. Money
spent for such improvements is
money well spent, and we be
lieve that the taxpayers will vote
wisely if they vote ves next
Tuesday.
Bridge Bonds- and Prosperity
On January 11th, 1916, the
proposition of bonding Navajo
county for $63,000 for the con
struction of several bridges in
different parts of the county, will
bi submitted to the voters for
their approval, On the success
or failure of this proposition in a
measure depends the future de
velopment and advancement of
Navajo coanty. in keeping with
other counties of the state. Pub
lic highways must be opened and
bridges must be built, so that all
parts of the county are conven
iently connected up with one an
other for the free intercourse of
the people iff we ever expect to
attract permanent settlers, and
thereby increase the business

Tns, We hav e got by the

permanent roads must be
established and maintained.
It is a short-sighted policy that
always starts figuring on the
probable increase in taxes, with
out at least stopping to figure out
the accruing advantages in the
progress of the community. The
details of the tax levy are fully
set out in an able article by C.
E. Perkins, the county engineer,
printed elsewhere in this issue,
clearly demonstrating the tax
increase is nil. No payments on
the bonds will be made for ten
vears, and they run for a period
of twenty-five years. Wmslow

Monuments is Completed
Completion of the $5,000 me

government at Sentinel Point
Arizona, to Major John Wesley
Powell, the celebrated scientist,
who first explored the Grand
Canyon of the Colorado, was an
nounced a few days ago by Se
cretary Lane. It will be dedi
cated'early in the summer.
The memorial, which stands
on the rim of the Grand Canyon,
is in the form of an altar decor
ated in Indian imagery support
! a bronze tablet. It was planned
to commemorate especially Major
Powell's services in making the
United States geological survey
an efficient organization.
Arizona Wants a Seaport
Advices from Phoenix are to
the effect that a movement is on
foot in that city toward extend
ing the southern boundary of
Arizoria to and including the
thirty-first parallel were taken
recently by the Young Men'sff.
Business association of that city.
The fact that such an exten
sion is now possible was tipped
off to a member of that organiza
tion by a member of the diplo
matic service, and steps were
taken at once which, if success
ful, will give Arizona a seaport
on the Gulf of California.
To have three seaports on the
Gulf of California would be one
of the greatest boons ever hand
ed over to this state. It would
mean connecting Tucson by a
direct .railroad line with a port
on the gulf. The road already
partially completed to Ajo would
probably be extended so as to
connect with one of these ports.
Port Is.abel and Port Lobos,
two of the Mexican ports to be
taken in by the proposed annexa
tion, are both large and well
patronized. The extension of
territory that would thus be
gained, would also be a great
thing for this state, as the new
land would take in some of the
largest and richest section of
northern Sonora.
Concerted action by the peo
ple of Arizona, in taking up this
matter with the powers that be
in Washington, is sought. -Nogales
Oasis.
Bonds Bring Good Premium
Road bonds recently voted in
Gila countv to the amount of
$350.000 have been sold at a pre
mium of $20,100, or nearly 6 per
cent above par. This is evidence
that such bonds are in great de
mand by investors, and the bonds
of Navajo County, if voted next
Tuesday, will probably sell at
just as high premium.
Another argument in favor of
voting the bonds is that any per
son in the county will be pri
veleged to bid on the construc
tion of the bridges. Separate
contracts' will be let for each
bridge and the work will be su
pervised by the county board,
and opportunity will be given for
the employment of local people.

Snow Storm Damaged Property
The snow storm that prevailed
in northern Arizona last week
did considerable damage in se-
. 1 . i T7U i. C A 1
verai localities, ai r lasum. uie
fall of snow was the heaviest in
history; over 5 feet fell and many
buildings in the city caliapsed
from the weight of the snow.
No loes of life is reported and
the property loss is not great as
the buildings wrecked were
mostly old ones and not very
valuable.
In the immediate vicinity of
Holbrook the storm lasted for
only about 12 hours and less than
a foot of snow fell. In the coun
try south of Holbrook the storm
hajl raged for nearly a week be
fore it reached the lower coun
try. Prof. Peterson, county su
perintendent, was at his home, in
Lakeside all of last week and he
States that a blizzard prevailed
in that section all week. In
coming to Holbrook Sunday he
was forced to ride horseback as
far as Snowflake.
While the storm was unusually
severe, and the fall of snow very
heavy, it is not thought that
the 3 has been any considerable
loss of livestock. Stock is in
good condition and can withstand
a long siege of cold weather.
The mild weather of the past
few days has caused the snow to
melt rapidly and unless more
falls there will soon be none on
the ground in the valley.
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy
Most Effectual
"I have taken a great many
bottles of Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy and every time it has
cured me. I have found it most
effectual for a hacking cough
and for colds. After taking it a
cough always disappears,"
writes J. R. Moore, Lost Valley,
Ga. Obtainable everywhere.

Walter McLaws, the popular
proprietor of the Ford garage,
won the heartfelt thanks of
every resident of Holbrook last
Friday afternoon. Immediately
after the snow had ceased fall
ing, Mr. McLaws took his Hup
mobile. fastened a V-shape drag
to the rear axle and drove over
the entire town, breaking paths
through the deep snow. None
of the main streets was over
looked and paths were also made
in most of the side streets. Mr.
McLaws' act was one of the most
thoughtful and commendable
acts that The News has ever
noticed and we are sure that it
was greatly appreciated by all
the people.

sionary to New Zeland last fall.
