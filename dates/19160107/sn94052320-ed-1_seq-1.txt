It waa Senator Day'a addreae that
eryotaJliaed tba aenUmenta that have
been expressed alnoe tha beginning of
tha eongrees and directed them Into a
definitely Indicated line of artion.
Plainly and anequlvoeally ha de
clared himself In favor of atate guar
antee of Irrigation and drainage bonds,
and In favor of the enactment of a law
providing for tha establishment of a
system of rural eredita. -

"Rural credits are essential to the

these and seek relief through the bal-

"Whv not nut the state back of
these projoctat"
Mr. Day agreed with tha other
speakers at tha eongreea that the
Jones bill providing for government
backing of irrigation projects Is an ex
cellent bill and expressed the hope
that It way be passed by eonsress.
"But If It fails," be cried, "ara you
members of this Irrigation Congress
going to let even another year elapse

"The thing to do is to atop marking

the cost of reservations before they
will close contract. It ia estimated
here that $16,000 will have to be put
up by delegates and others attending

in advance.
