KING AGENT

SAYS LATEST
Frank C. Lowry, Sales Agent
For Federal Co., Not Getting
Support for Internal Taxa
tion Plan '
Hawaii's interest in the sugar
tariff has resulted in much dis
t'Ussioii of the possible effect on
tariff legislation of Frank ('.'Low
ry's effort to secure publicity for
his internal revenue taxation plan.
The 'New York sugar refining in
terests are alleged to be behind
Lowry 's recent propaganda for
the imposition of a ceut Per
pound consumption tax on the do
mestic sugar crop, and this pro
paganda, the American Cane
Growers' Association charges, is
a part of the general plan of the
"refining clique to stamp out
competition from the domestic
sugar farmers.
To get the latest Washington
news on Lowry 's campaign the
Star-Bulletin cabled to its Wash
ington correspondent and today
received the following reply:
" Washington, D. C, Jan. 7.
Lowry crusade accomplishing no
thing. Sugar situation unchang
ed. Outlook continues favorable.
No hitch anticipated.' V
Lowry, sales agent for the Fed"
eral Sugar Refilling Company, has
advocated the 1 internal revenue
tax on sugar for more than a year,
The Cane Growers -Association
declares that a recent resolution
by Senator Pore, calling upon the
treasury department to furnish es-,
timates of the probable revenues
to be derived from taxes on tea
and automobiles as well as qng
ar, has for its main purpose the
plan of the refiners to get the
Lowry proposal before the senate.

Circuit Judge T, B. Stuart today

The decision handed' down by Judge
Stuart brought to a dose, temporarily

there were but few conjectures as to
the stand which would be taken by
the court in deciding the action, it
was conceded by many who heard the

as he did todays
It was the contention of the terri
tory that, the Rapid Transit should
be restrained from increasing Its pres

$1,600,000. While there' were many
items of the business of the system
which were' made of issue, such as
