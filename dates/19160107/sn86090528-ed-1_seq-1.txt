MONASTIR, Serbia, Dec. 1.
(By mall.) One of Colonel
Vassich's nix bodyguards when
he took me to the Serbian
trenches which protect Mona
stir, was Cbrlsto George, 213
E. Twenty-third street, Fort
Worth, Texas. "The colonel
gave me permission to come to
t'i front today," ho told me,
"so I could try t find out In
the trenches what became ot
my wife and children when the
Bulgars took Vribianl. I left
my wife there with the girls, 3
and 2 years old, and while I
was gone the Bulgarians came.
I have heard the town was
burned and I am afraid they
were killed." George spent
that day In the trenches with
the last Serbian soldiers who
left Vribianl. I met him on the
return trip and he said he
cm lun't find out a word about
them. The soldiers all said the
town was burning when they
left and that the Bulgars came
Inl shooting In every direction.

MONASTIR, Serbia. Dec. 1. (Tty
mail.) There was a white stone
monument, man high, beside the
Serbian trenches. In fact It was part
of the trench line. 1 asked Colonel
Vasslch, who was pointing out the
Bulgar position six miles away across
the Halinci valley, -what the monument
meant.
"Three years ago," ho .said, "we
fought the Turks there. It is eighteen
.nilles from Monastir and marks the
rearest point to the city that the
Turks attained. It's a gravestone.
Four thousand Serbians died in this
valley in four days, but stopped the
Turk". Monastir and the Serbian gov
ernment were preparing to build a
memorial church where that stone
stands, when this war began." A Ser
bian trench ran to the foot of the
monument, exposing Us base. Middle
aged, third reserve Serbian soldiers In
the trench were building o fire and
putterinlg over a kettle filled with raw
meat. The memory of that battle of
niallnci three years ago, was not on
their minds. Neither was the present
battle. There was no firing just then,
but their rifles lay on the trench
ridge, ready. They weren't Interested
In the monument. The thing on their
minds was dinner.
Across the valley we heard rifle
shots, perhaps a hundred. But no bul
lets whistled near us. The colonel ex
plained that It was In a little village
on the flat plain a mile and a quarter
from us. Our maps showed that its
name was Lau. We could see th
ehort main street, with perhaps 50
,V houses. Tall, leafless trees, regularly
'ranged, marked Uie cross street. Tha
shooting sounded again. Through our
glasses we looked In vain to discover
humaus there. In the autumn sun
shine the village lay, quiet and de
serted except for the sound of shoot-
"Comitadjis," explained the colonel.
J asked if there were any people left
in the town. He replied that evidently
the Bulgars had found somebody. Who
was the somebody? Women and chil
dren? They must have been hiding in
Jthelr houses. Were the comitadjis go
ing from house to house, shooting and
killing? Was this a massacre? 1
asked the colonel. He didn't know; it
might be. A column of smoke rose
from the village. Through our glasses
v.c saw a house burning.
We couldn't find out what happened i
In the little village of Lau that morn -
ing. Other' buildings were afire wheu
we left. No one could go over tbere.
A thousand men, perhaps, might have
fought their way there, but that would
have caused the resumption of the
battle of Halinci, which Colonel Vas
slch was not quite ready to resume.
It was lunch time when we got back
to the main road and our auU.
On a bale of hay a soldier stretched
a tablecloth and placed tin plates, tin
cups, wine, bread and cheese. Other
bales of hay were our chairs. Behind
us stood a caisson. I noticed soldiers
leading six huge oxen up to It. They
hitched them to it and the wheels
touched the back of my "chair" as the
caisson rolled away.
A hundred feet off stood a cannon
In a crude, cellar-like hole. A dozen
soldiers hauled It out on level ground.
Other oxen were hitched to It. Within
a few moireuts the caisson and the
cannon were drawn from the field to
the main road, and guarded by a score
of soldiers, the procession started
slowly back toward Monastir. ,
That was all part of the Serbian re

NEW YORK, Jan. 7. 'When the one
hundred and seventy-seven passengers
who were on board the abandoned
Greek liner Thessalonika were landed
here today from the steamer Patria,
they told a thrilling story of their suf
ferings at sea and mutiny on board
the distressed ship.
They said all but three members of
the crew of the Thessalonika turned
against Captain Goul and with steer

captain on the night of December 26,
because the captain refused to trans

after their own vessel had sprung a
leak In a hurricane.
Captain Goul faced the mutineers
