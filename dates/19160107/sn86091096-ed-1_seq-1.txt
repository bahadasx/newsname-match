Sales of Grain

Wheat Brings $11,000 at Ilo
and Barley About $10,000
at Lewiston

Lewiston, Idaho, Dec. 30.—The
Approach of the first of the year, at
which time warehouse charges on
grain stored will begin to accrue, to
gether with a material advance in
prices, is responsible for scales of
of local holding. The prices offer
ed yesterday were: Wheat—Blue
stem, 87c; forty-fold, 87c; club,
34c. red Russian, 81c. Oats, $1.01.
Barley, $1.12.
Among the larger sales reported
are 9000 sacks of barley, purchased
from the "21" ranch by the M. M.
Houser agency at $1.18 for blue
brewing and $1.12 for feed, and the
purchase by the the same agency of
the George Chapman and George
Tatko crops of wheat at Ilo, involv
upon a time there was a
"good-for-nothing,'-' who refused to
follow his father's trade of stone
cutter and became a loafer. He
ing about $11,000.
The Fable of the Loafer
Once
was fat and ugly, with a bull-neck
a round, bald head, thick lips, pro
truding eyes and snub nose. He
spent his time talking, with whom
soever would listen to him. He re
spected no one, rich or poor. He
loved a joke, went barefooted and
allowed his clothes to become soiled.
He spent most of his time drinking
at the public drinking place. Fin
ally he married, but instead of re
forming his ways, he continued to
loaf along the streets, talking, and
refused to earn money to support
himself and his wife. Frequently
the woman could be seen leading
him through the streets by the ear,
berating him soundly with her ton
gue, and frequently with a broom
stick. That man was Socrates—the
wisest man the world has ever seen.
He had the greatest brain of any
man who has ever lived. He was
< the father of philosophers-the great
est of thinkers. •
MORAL: Don't judge a man by
his habits.
Non-Military, Non-Anti-Milit
ary, Non-Political
Resolution* pasted Ly Executive
Board in October, 1915
"Resolved, that the Executive
Board take the position that it
would be inappropriate for the Boy
Scouts of America to take any offi
cial action with reference to any
question of policy for the United
States Government in matters cap
able of difference of opinion of a
political character. Each official
and member should be given full
opportunity for freedom of thought
and action as an individual but not
as a representave of the Scout
Movements.
"It should be clearly understood:
"First—That the Boy Scouts
Movement is not anti-military. The
Boy Scout Movement neither pro
motes nor discourages military
training, its one concern being the
development of character and per
sonal efficency of adolescent boys.
"Second—That the records show
that the logical result of the pro
j-gram whiA the Boy Scout Move
Mnent i§ promoting is in reality as
strong a factor as any other one
agency which the country now has
for preparedness, since it develops
the character of boys and assists
them in securing a proper concep
tion of a citizen's responsibility.
"Third—Futhermore, boys who
have been Scouts will, ' because of
their training under the motto 'Be
Prepared,' prove themselves more
virile and efficient in any emergency
which calls for their services as citi
zens of the country."

i Pat Maloney was mailing a box
I containing articles which he intend

j the nature of the contents a friend
I knew it was essential that the box

to Pat to write conspicuously on the
case: "This side up with care." A
few days afterwards, seeing Pat
again, he asked: "Heard any more
about your goods? Did they get
there safely?"
Everyone of them broke," said
Pat. *
"The whole lot? Did you label
it: 'This side up,' as I told you?"
"Yes, I did. And for fear they
shouldn't see it on the cover, I put
it on the bottom, too."

A Golden Opportunity
One of the most important sess
ions ever faced by Congress has just
opened. Following his custom,
President W'ilson read from the
speaker's stand to the assembled
legislators a message brimming
wi h important recommendations.
It matters not whether individually
or as party measures we agree or
disagree with the president on pre
paredness, the Mexican situation,
the method of raising additional re
venue or on any of the other ques
tions taken up in his message, we
all must agree that the country
stands now on the eve of the great
est prosperity it has ever seen and
legislation should be passed which
will help instead of retarding or
lessening that prosperity. It is, for
instance, a tremendously important
matter that business be let alone to
grasp its opportunity. We have
passed through a period of muck
raking and restrictive legislation
which has, perhaps, been of benefit
in making business more hupian.
We have put a heart into the co
operation even though they may
still be soul-less. But in doing so
we came perilously near to destroy
ing them altogether. It is certain
that many bills will be introduced
at the present session of congress
which will effect business interests.
Those should be passed which will
help business to overcome the de
pression of the past years and go
onward and upward. Those which
would further restrict business
operation- should be killed without
mercy. This is no time for the
passage of radical legislation regard
less of the apparent demand for it.
Organizations which are demand
ing certain legislation are noted for
the noise they make because of the
effect a noisy demand has upon legis
lators. These organizations should
be suppressed altogether, and, if
not, for the time being at least.
The government finds it necessary
to raise huge amounts of additional
revenue. To make this successful,
the president recommends that no
present sources of revenue be tarn
pered with. Legislation against
existing industries will directly pro
pose the president's recommenda
tion.
