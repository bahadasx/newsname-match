SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 7. China
.will have to make over her army. She
has been guilty of a great mistake.
Different regiments of her army have
been trained along different lines, and
so units cannot act together In one
compact fighting machine.
This is the opinion of Robert Park,
managing editor of the China World,
and a Yale graduate, who la keeping
in close touch with the situation in
China.
"The Chinese army has been train
ed by the offlcera of every nation in
Europe, hired for the purpose," said
Park. "British, French, German,
Belgian, Russians and Turks have
drilled our different regiments. But
here Is where the tragedy, or the com
edy, or whatever you might call it,
comes In. One regiment has learned
a different manual or arms than an
other. And so on down the line, until
the Cblnest army, mobilised, would,
n.arch and charge seven different,
ways, If tho command to advance were
given." I
Two local cases have been transmit
ted to circuit courts outside of Klam
ath county for decisions. These decl-
'alons will then be sent to the local
'court, and will be entered on the Jour
jnal and Judgment rolls as the findings
i of tho local circuit court.
Financial Secretary Mary Hogue. Tno BUt of Catherine Prehm, pub-
nwil at a private house part taboo? K8 todJr considered tho
Decidedly not.
So, at any rate, rules District At
torney Evans of Portland. He holds
that it Is not unlawful to servo a
guest with an intoxicating beverage.
Evan also has provided for those
who hae "something on their hip" to
play the Good 3.marltan role. Thla
Is. by his ruling, that it Is no viola
tion of the prohibition law to give
liquor to another In case of sickness.
The cabinet and members of eoa-
menf s'pollcy "regarding- tho Persia
