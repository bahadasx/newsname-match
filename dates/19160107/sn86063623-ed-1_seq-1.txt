Committees of our body visited

building, County ' offices a n d
County Farm and wish to make
the following recommendations:
We visited the jail and jail
building and find the same to be
in good condition and well kept
but would recommend that the
floor of the cells upstairs be re
paired as we found several holes
in the floors, where the concrete
was worn through.
We would recommend that the
in this room at the present time
does not heat this room in mod
erate weather.
-,sVe find upon examination that
most all of the offices are insuffi
ciently heated.
We find the urinals and closets
about the court house in an un
sanitary condition and we rec
ommend that a thorough clean
ing of same be had.
We visited the County Farm
and found same to be in good
conditions; we find 23 inmates in
the house and they seem to be
well satisfied with their treat
ment and conditions surrounding
them.
