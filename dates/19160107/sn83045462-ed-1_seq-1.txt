LONDON*. January 7.?Ac1
cording to official advices from
Vienna, the fighting on the eastern
front has decreased in violence,
tiie Russians having ceased
to attack with vigor between the
Prepet and the Bessarabian fron
tier.
It is believed that even though
no further gain should be made,
Russia's forces have attained a
position which will give the na'tion
a degree of power in Balkan
affairs it has not had since its
armies were driven back from the
Carpathians.
Germans Hay Be Forced Back.
It appears not improbable, according
to advices from the front, that the
Austro-German forces at the southern
extremity of the fighting area will be
forced back to the line running through
, Kolomea. Stanislaw and Galich in the
near future as the result of the steady,
continuous advance of the Russians between
the upper reaches of the River
. Stripa and the Rumanian frontier, Petrograd
advices say.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
Austrians are fighting courageously,
the Russians, it is declared, have succeeded
in taking by storm fortifications
around Czernowitz that were recently
described in the German press as impregnable.
Having cut the railway line
from Zalesczavki to Czernowitz, the
Russians are threatening communication
between Czernowitz and Kolomea.
Offensive Extends Northward.
The zone of the Russian offensive is
extending northward, bringing into action
the left flank of the central front.
From Olitza they have pushed out on
the railway line twenty-five miles to
Kevertzl and are reported advancing
along the roads in the direction of and
close to Lutsk, and also between Podcherevitchi
and Kostuhova, three miles
north of the Kovel-Sarny railway west
of the river Styr. These positions are
regarded as especially advantageous,
being: flanked on the right by the Pinsk
marshes, precluding a serious menace
fiotn that direction.
Austrians Hard Pressed.
Although the situation around Czernowitz
has not yet been cleared up officially,
it appears from advices from
, Russian sources that the Austrians are
hard pressed over a long line of defence
and are throwing huge reinforcements
into the district. The Russians
?.??re are expected to strike at the Kolomea-Stanislau-Halicz
line, where powerful
defensive works have been in
pieparation for some time by the Austro-<iermans.
Meanwhile the Russian position 250
miles further north on the middle Styr
river has been greatly strengthened by
successful operations in the region of
the great marshes where the Russians
are beginning to emerge from the
marshes with prospects of being able
K> use the roads leading either northwest,
west or southwest Their advance
here has not been the result of
an isolated battle, but of a series 01 engagements
lasting over a considerable
period. In the capitals of the entente
allies the opinion is expressed that the
Russian advance has completely upset
the plans of the central powers for an
invasion of Saloriiki and Kgypt.
Ferocious Fighting Reported.
PARIS, January 7.?Fighting on the
f Russian frontier is fast growing in intensity
and assuming great ferocity

SUBMARINE CRISIS
BEFORECABINET
President's Advisers Indorse
His Policy of Awaiting Definite
Information.
i
| DETAILS STILL MISSING
IN CASE OF THE PERSIA
Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee to Consider Situation?Austria's
Last Note Unanswered.
The submarine crisis, still of uncertain
status, because of lack of details,
was placed by President Wilson before
the cabinet today in its first meeting
since his return from Hot Springs. Va.
The Senate foreign relations committee
also met to consider the situation, but.
as Chairman Stone was detained at the
White House by a conference with the
President, adjourned without action.
Although more than a week has
passed since the steamship Persia was
sunk in the Mediterranean- with the
loss of American life, officials were
today still uninformed as to whether
or not the vessel was torpedoed, and,
if so. the nationality of the submarine
and other details which would determine
the nature of the action the
White House has announced it will
take.
Will Await Official Advices.
Developments continued today to indicate
tha^the American government would
withhold action pending official advices
determining these points.
Overnight developments included the receipt
of dispatches from Ambassador Penfield
at Vienna asserting that the Austrian
government was without information
concerning the incident up to the
night of January 4, and from Consuls
Carrels at Alexandria, Egypt, stating that
he had obtained affidavits from twentyone
survivors, including Charles H. Grant,
an American citizen, and that all confirmed
previous statements that "no
v% a ruing was given ana no vessel was
seen."
Ambassador Penfield's dispatch added
tha-. Baron Burian, the Austrian foreign
minister, has asked what information
concerning the incident was in
possession of the United States,
j Officers and crew of the Persia, Con!
sul Garrels reported, have left Aiexandria
for England. Their affidavits,
State Department officials believed,
would be obtained upon their arrival
there.
Cabinet Agrees With President.
As th'e cabinet assembled it was made
plain that the members agreed with
the President that in the case of the |
Persia nothing can be done until all j
the facts were at hand. Some members i
expressed the opinion that it might |
never be learned whether the Persia |
j was sunk by a submarine, and, if so, j
what nation was responsible. I
Regarless of the outcime of the Persia
I case. however, the majority of the I
cabinet members are represented as be- I
lieving that the time has come for making
certain that no further attacks on )
merchant ships carrying Americans will j
be made. The administration leaders are i
said to feel that continued loss of American
lives will lead the United States into'
hostilities.
The Persia incident was taken up
only briefly at the cabinet meeting, |
because Secretary Dansing had no defi- j
nite recommendations to make in the
absence of specific facts regarding the
I *> ?v. me Bill}/. uiic cauinei mem- i
ber said that the mention of the for!
eign situation at the meeting- was !
I "only superficial." J
Secretary Lansing said he expected I
to confer with Count von Bernstorff, I
j the German ambassador, later today j
over the Lusitania negotiations. An I
early settlement has been indicated.
Hoped for Definite Information. \
State Department officials had hoped I
that, inquiries of the Vienna foreign I
office would result in information
which might clear up the doubt regard- j
ing the circumstances of the disaster. !
It was considered still possible that the-,
Austro-Hungarian government might J
obtain the desired information later.
This was based upon the supposition
that, a submarine operating where the
Persia was sunk might have been so
far from its base that its commander
would be unable to report promptly.
Officials expressed the belief that the
Vienna foreign office would advise Mr.
Penfleld should the information be received
in the future.
No Present Reply to Austrian Note.
it was disclosed today, after the official
text of Austria's reply to the secone
American note in the Ancona case
had been made public, that no response
would he inadi until the facts in the
case of the Persia are cleared up or it
is found impossible to do so.
The official text varies only in translation
with the unofficial version cabled
in press dispatches from London. Jt is
regarded a_; meeting all of the Ameri
ican demands.
Committee of the Senate
Pails Today to Consider
Crisis in Foreign Affairs,
Trie Senate foreign relations committee
transacted no business today, nor
did it take up for consideration the
I diplomatic issues arising from the Eu!
ronean war. as had been expected. Half
ja dozen members of the committee were
; present when Senator Stone, the chair?
ma i. telephoned from the w hite House
I ihat he was detained. The senator told
i the senators to go ahead with whati
ever business they might wish to dis!
cuss, but the committee immediately
'adjourned.
Senator Stone said later that there
was nothing immediately pressing bei
fore th.? committee, and that in so far
| as the sinking of the British ship Persia,
with loss of American lives, was concerned
no intelligent discussiorf could
be indulged because facts in theicase
still were lacking. Several senators
were of the opinion that no definite information
regarding the cause of the
disaster to. the Persia ever woi?ld be
procured.
No Action on Fletcher Nomination.
The committee had proposed particu|
larly to consider today the nomination
of Henry Prather Fletcher to be ambassador
to Mexico. Republican senators
who oppose confirmation until
President Wilson has sent the Senate
information regarding recognition of
the Carranza government, say, however,
that they have no objection to reporting
the Fletcher nomination to the
Senate.
LONDON. January 7.?An announcement
made by the Peninsular and Oriental
Steamship Company says that the
number of persons on board the
steamer Persia who have not been accounted

119 were passengers and 217 nembiri
of the crew.

First Reading in House

LONDON. January 7.?There
seems little doubt that a general
election will be the very last
measure resorted to bv the government
to obtain the desired
"general consent" to the establishment
of the attenuated form
of compulsion provided for in the
pending military service bill.
That such general consent would
be obtained by an appeal to the
country is admitted bv/virtually
every one, but the belief is expressed
in many quarters that it
can be won without such an upheaval.
Three Ministers Resign. I
As the result of hostility to the gov- it
ernment's measure by British labor fl
the resignations from the coalition f<
ministry of all three labor members, a
Arthur Henderson, William Brace and o
George H. Roberts, holding, respective- a
Iv, the offices of president of the board jr
of education, parliamentary undersecretary
for home affairs and lord com- tl
missfoner of the treasury, have been b
announced: Others, it is declared, are
possible.
The question on every tongue at the O
political rendezvous clubs is whether si
the momentous events of the day had
brought a general election within lj
sight. ir
In Critical Position.
An appeal to the country and a break
up of both the coalitioV: government
and tlu: labor party are contingencies
of the near future, and while the gov- b.
ernment has secured what in ordinary c<
I circumstances would be regarded as a j m
satisfactory majority, 298. for its bill, a!
the defection of a large section of the (i
labor party, with the loss of four t4(
members of the government, admitted- J
ly places the government in a critical i
position, and many doubts are expressed
that it will succeed in weathering thejc<
storm. ni
Possible Appeal to Country. i P1
pi
No cabinet council yet has been sum- (jj
moned, and a majority of the members pj
of the house of commons are averse to c<
a general election, but an appeal to the
country may come about in either of
two ways. First, the house of lords
could, without the consent of the gov- g;
eminent, bring the life of parliament
to an end by simply declining to pro- (J
ceed with the parliament and regTstra- ei
l tion bill, which prolongs the life of c!
parliament eight months. On the other a
hand, it rnay still be found that Kegi- rr
nald McKenna, chancellor of the ex- n
chequer, ancC Walter Kunciman, president
of the board of trade, are quitting
the cabinet, though nothing yet is
known of their position, in which case
it would not be improbable that the H
government would seek an exit from r,
Us difficulties by resigning and ap- ..
pealing to ths country.
i<
Wild Scenes in Commons. a
Scenes of wild enthusiasm reigned P
when the house of commons last night
passed the first reading of the government
bill for compulsory military <!
service, by the decisive vote of 402 il
to 100. a
The vote came shortly before mid- c
night, with the galleries again packed, n
every seat on the floor of the house u
occupied, the ministerial benches filled, ^
and an air of eager expectancy prevailing.
The events of the day had in- ,l
creased the tension to a high pitch, %
ndtably the action of lh? labor con- ?
gress, and the quick sequel of the retirement
of three labor members of the
ministry.
Pi
Arouses Lagging Spirits. td
u;
Throughout these developments out- rt
side of parliament th^ debate in the b
house had forged steadily ahead, but Jji
had been left largely to lesser figures. 1(
It was reserved for A. J. Kalfour, first p,
lord of the admiralty, to close the de
bate iri behalf of the government, and'J
he did it ill a persuasive appeal of half
an hour, which roused the lagging m
spirits of the advocates of the bill and f,
turned the tide of adversity wiiich had ni
been running steadily against the s<
measure through the debate and the
outside events of the day.
"Let this vote tonight show that we , '
are a united people," was his closing j f,
appeal. "Do not let us give a false im- :}
presslon to the world that-?n the mo-1 J.
ment of the country's gravest cmer- j'
gency we are divided one against an- t
other. Abandon your abstract theories
and remember we are dealing with "
stern realities which call for great sac- ...
riflces." ?. Vl
Result Is Cheered.
Then came the vote, which was taken
amid eager interest as the members si
(lied before the tellers, and peers d
crowded to their galleries to witness bl
the final result. The announcement of
the figures was received with a tremen- S
dous outburst of cheering, which rang
through the chamber and was echoed
to the waiting crowds outside. Scores 11
of members in khaki waved their hand- h
kerchiefs, and the air was rent with si
white papers flung In triumph at the government's
success.

ig with satisfaction, walked down the
oor of the house to present the bill
irmally to the chamber. His appearnce
was the signal for a rapturous
vation, members of all sidles standing
nd cheering, while the galleries could
rith difficulty be restrained from joinjg
in the enthusiasm.
An analysis of the vote showed that
le government had held the great
lk of the liberal and conservative
ote. The Irish nationalists had voted
gainst the bill, but the Irish unionis
supported the measure, and the
'Brienites took no part in the divion.
The minority showed a sprinkling of
beral members, the most notable "beig
John Bums, the former cabinet
lember. A number of labor members
Iso voted with the opposition.
Labor Congress Important.
The labor congress, which yesterday
y a great vote refused to indorse
impulsion, was, in many ways, the
ost important body of the kind ever
ssembled. More than one thousand
elegates were present, representing
)0 unions and 3,000,000 workers.
In addition to tiie formal vote against
?e government's^ compulsion bill, the
>ngress rejected by four to one a
lotion pledging support to the princile
of compulsion for single men, and
:issed by two to one another motion
irecting 11*e labor party to oppose the
ill in all its stages in the house of
?mmons.
The congress closed with an enthuastic
scene, the feature of which was
te singing of the socialist anthem,
rite Ked Flag," by some of the deleates.
The delegates met in the so-called
lentral Hall, a large ne.w building
reeted by the Wesleyan Methodist
hurches opposite Westminster Abbey
nd a stone's throw from the parlialent
buildings, as the denomination's
alionaL. headquarters.
Makes Fiery "Antiv Speech.
One of the early speakers, James
lenry Thomas, assistant general secetary
of the Amalgamated Society of
ailway Servants, kindled his hearers
i fierce enthusiasm. His was an ouind-oul
aid i-compulsion speech, up-|
ealing to the trade unions "not to
ell their heritage of freedom." ?
A speech by Arthur Henderson, presi- j
ent of the board of education, came as
sedative to the passionate feelings
roused by earlier speakers. He spoke
almly and logically, defending not
lerely the resolution before the meetlg.
but also the compulsion bill itself,
ut his effort was insufficient to turn
le tide ot opposition and it was a foreone
conclusion when the vote finally
as reached that the resolution would
til.
With the exception of the Miners'
ederation, which refused to particjate
owing to internal differences with
le joint board, virtually every trade
nion of importance in the country was

Will Stay in Parliament.
Arthur Henderson and his two
liner labor colleagues who resigned
om the coalition ministry will retain
in the labor party and retain their
?ats in parliament.
Mr. Henderson said, regarding a sugestion
concerning his resignation from
arliament made in his speech before
le labor congress, that he there stated
lat he would resign his seat if he were
efinitely bound by the vote of the
elegiftes to certain action In the
ouse. He has not been so bound and
lere is no reason for him to resign
nd seek re-election, he said, adding:
L am a supporter of the bill and shall
ote for it on every possible occasion."
The compulsion bill is supported
y about ten of the thirty-five members

now a divided vote at all its stages,

AQUEDUCT BRIDGE
[
Secretary Garrison Urges
Need of New Span at
Georgetown.
GIVES VIEWS IN LETTER
TO HOUSE AND SENATE
Tells Presiding Officers That Situation
Is Serious and Demands
Immediate Consideration.
;
Secretary Garrison today di-!
rected the attention of Congress j
to the pressing necessity of re-,
placing the antiquated Aqueduct
bridge over the Potomac river at!
Georgetown with a wider and
I
stronger structure. In a letter to'
the presiding officers of the Sen-'
ate and the House the Secretary
of War says he concurs in the'
views of Gen. Kingman, chief of
engineers, and those of Lieut.]
Col. C. A. F. Flagler, the engineer!
officer in charge of the repairs to j
the piers of the old bridge, to the !
effect "that the situation is one |
demanding serious and immediate
consideration.'- and saying that i
early action authorizing surveys
and plans for the construction of
a new bridge "is highlv desirable."
Secretary Garrison states that
the chief of engineers believes
"on account of the important
traffic and navigation interests involved"
that the department
should be left free in any appro
[jjiaiujii u liiv. 11 m<t\ ijc niciuc iui <
the. purpose, "to assign the surveys
and the recommendations
as to the site, within such limits
as Congress may tix, and also
the preparation of plans, to a
board of engineer officers." The
Secretary adds that he concurs in
that suggestion.
Basis for Department's Action.
The action of the War Department in
this matter is based on a special report
made by Col. Flagler showing the dangerous
condition of the Aqu^Jact bridge.
"As a result of inspections," says Col.
Flagler, "made in connection with the annua!
repairs to the piers of the Aqueduct
bridge across the Potomac river, 1 am
compelled to report that I do not consider
the bridge safe for the traffic now
using it. and 1 do not believe, without a
radical change in the methods employed
for the maintenance of the bridge, that
it will long be safe for traffic of any
ki nrt
"I therefore urge that recommendations
he made to the Commissioners
of the District of Columbia that the
traffic regulations for the bridge be
immediately modified as follows:
"(a). That not more than one street
railway car be allowed on the bridge.
"(b). That the maximum weight of
wheeled vehicles permitted on the
bridge be three tons for animal drawn
vehicles (exclusive of the animal9) and
four tons for motor vehicles.
"(c). That police supervision be had
to prevent excessive overloading of
the bridge by traffic at any time.
"(d). That during periods of heavy
ice movement in the rive) all traffic
over the bridge be suspended.
Condition of Old Piers.
"I further urge that the condition of
the piers (fully described in the report)
be brought to the attention of
Congress with a recommendation that
funds be provided as soon as practicable.

new bridge to replace the present one."
After giving a history of the old
bridge and describing the condition of
each of the five defective p ers and the
method of repairing them. Col. Flagler
sa ys:
"1 consider the situation as one demanding
serious and immediate consideration.
1 believe that the reduction
of traffic recommended, with a careful
observance of movement in the
piers, will render the bridge reasonably
safe until next spring, but still not
devoid of danger. Various sites for new
bridges have been suggested. These
sues are lai jum uoove me present

would be entirely satisfactory.
Bridge Buiit in 1888.
"If rebuilding of the old piers in the
present bridge can be undertaken the ]
work can be done without entire stop- *
page of traffic. The present superstruc- 1
ture of the Aqueduct bridge is a rather light
iron truss, which was erected in !
1888. The vibration under heavy loads J
on the bridge appears to me excessive, \
but the superstructure is not under ,
charge of this office, and 1 have there- t
fore had no examination made of it."
In addition to notifying Congress of
the condition of the Aqueduct bridge.
Secretary Garrison also sent a copy of
the report of Col. Flagler, suggesting *
safety regulations to govern traffic i
over the bridge, to the Commissioners s
of the District, who have entire juris- 4
diction over the superstructure of the ,
bridge. *

FORMAL COMMENTS RESERVED
Senate Members Think Fact That
Joint Select Committee Was
Unanimous in Findings Will
Have Great Weight.
At least one bill. and. perhaps
two. embodying the recommendations
and the sense, of the report
from the joint select committee
of Congress on the fiscal relations
between the United States and
District of Columbia, printed in
The Star yesterday, will be introduced
in the House. Among
members of the Senate the opinion
was expressed that tirst affirmative
action will be taken bv
the House and that the fiscal
plan outlined in the report will
be enacted into law.
Chairman Johnson of the House
District committee already has
started work on a measure which
will follow without deviation the
joint committee's report, including
the abolition of the half-andhalf
principle of appropriation,
providing for the retention of that
system for the purposes of paying
the interest on the 3.65 bonds,
and outlining an inheritance tax.
At the same time, the three
members of the joint select committee
from the House, Representatives
Rainey, Card and
woopci, auer consultation witn
Representative Page, chairman
of the subcommittee in charge of
the District appropriation bill,
have decided that in order to put
the finishing touches to their
work of compiling the report
they should collaborate on a
measure for introduction in the
House?such measure to put into
concrete legislative form what
they believe should be enacted
to change the present relations
between the District and the
United States.
Prospects for Action Bright.
Along with the question of a change
in the relations which have existed for
forty years there runs the extremely
form of the government in the District
and also to give the National Capital
representation on the floor of the House.
Every member of Congress questioned
as to the general situation today
touched upon these subjects, and'in the
present slate of affairs it would appear
that all that is needed to get action on
the self-government and representation
question is for some one in Congress
to push the subject vigorously.
But first and foremost comes the joint
select committee's report and the gossip
and possibilities concerning enactment
from it.
Both committee chairmen, in whom
the District is most interested?namely,
Representatives Johnson and Rage of
North Carolina?read the report carefully.
Neither of them would express
at this time any opinion for publioalion,
although it is quite evident Mr.
Rage is heartily in favor of the findings
and already lias gone to work to
find a way to frame the forthcoming
appropriation bill on the lines suggested
in that document.
Representative Johnson was asked
for an expression of opinion, and with
iliaracteristic immobility of countenance
replied:
do not care to make any comment
it this time, as 1 intend to make a
speech on the subject of the report at
mine opportune time. 1 intend also to
end the testimony before the commitee.
I have not read any of it up to
his time."
To Introduce Other Bills.
What Mr. Johnson will say undoubtedly
vill be of great interest. Furthermore, it
s possioie lO ueuuce m??. ~,4. ^
;ome criticism in his speech, as he said
oday that in addition to framing a bill
ollowing. exactly the lines of the commit ee
report, he intends to introduce other
ills on matters corollary to the general
ubject involved. He also said he would
ntroduce these bills without regard to
he appropriation bill, which now is in
.rocess of formation behind closed doors,
nd that he probably would allow his bjll
o take the regular course.
There also is a strong probability that
tepresentative Johnson will push his Dill
o tax intangible property within the Disrict
of Columbia. This would be met
irith the opposition of the single tax
lembers of his committee, Messrs. Croser
and Bailey, in addition to whatever
pposition would come from other memers
who believe such a tax neither necesary
nor just.
"Now that a change in the relationhip
may be made," Representative
ohnson was asked, "what about th*
roposals that always are before this
ommittee to allow self-government
nd a representation on the fUior of
longress?"
