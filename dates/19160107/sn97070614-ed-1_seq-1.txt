establishment of a scholarship at the

nation and establish the requirements.
On registration of the person awarded
this annual scholarship, there will be

byterian minister and a familiar and
imposing figure on the streets of
Owosso for several yaars, died at his
home on West King street early on i
Wednesday morning after an illness
of three weeks with inflammation of

son of a physician. While he was a ,

Sickness should be the only reason
why a single teacher of Shiawassee
County should absent himself from
any of these sessions. The Depart
ment of Public Instruction has made
the meeting a State Institute. Hence,
plan to be present and on time. Pub
lic spirited school officers and patrons
may feel free to attend and enjoy
these meetings. Teachers are hereby
authorized to extend an invitation to
all who may be interested in educa
tion. Deeper interest and co-opera
tion is our aim.
I am of the opinion that no teacher,
in either primary or graded district,
who has the right professional spirit,
will fail to attend. I know Shiawas
see teachers so well that I feel confi
dent that every one, from kinder
gartner to superintendent, will be in
attendance to get all the profit and
pleasure possible from hearing these
noted educators.

Ill Health' Causes Suiolde.
Martin Noonon. aged 66, a resident of
Owosso for thirty years, ended his life
early Tuesday morning at his home,
540 Gilbert street, by hanging. Mr.
Koonan took advantage of the ' brief
absence of his wife from their bed
room to accomplish the act.' Melan
cholia, due to ill health for twenty
years, is given as the cause of Mr.
Noonon's act.
Mr. Noonon's condition Monday night
was such that Mrs. Noonon cared for
him constantly throughout the night.
Tuesday morning, worn out, Mrs
Noonon went into the' next room to
rest. A few minutes later, she heard a
strange noise in the bed room and
entering, found her husband dead. He
had placed a leather
belt around the
bed post and placing his head through
the noose, had laid down and slowly
strangled. It Is believed that he was
demented when he committed the act,
for throughout the night he had given
every Indication of mental nnbalance,
the result of his long sufferings.
Mr. Noonon while able to work had
nt been well for twenty years and ,
during the last two or three years had
grown worse. Of late he bad failed
rapidly and once previously tried to
end his life. He was for many years
employed in local furniture factories.
The deceased was born in Massa
chusetts and came to Michigan with
his parents when a email boy. They
settled in Rush township and there
Mr. Noonon grew up. He moved to
Owosso thirty years ago and had lived j
all of Owosso. He was

The deed for the Chandler Marsh
which comprises about 3,040 acres,
lying in Bath and Dewitt townships,
was received ana recoroea in tne reg-
later of deed's office, Wednesday '
morning at 11 o clock. The property
was transferred from Mrs. Mary C.
Hale of Ellsworth, Me, oanghter of
the late Zachariah Chandler, to John T.
Remey and James W. Brooks of Bar-
lington, Iowa. Revenue stamps to the
amount of $17 were attached to the
deed. The consideration was not given
on the deed but it is thought that it
sold for about $15 per acre. Work has
already been begun on a large drain
and system of lateral drains to recover
this vast acreage, now almost a waste,
If this results successfully, the value
of the land will be trebled. Clinton

INIMICAL TO OWOSSO
Would Prohibit River Pollution From
Sewage Active Camptifn Undar
Way in Saginaw.
The cities situated along rivers tribu
tary to the Saginaw Owosso, Flint,
Midland, Bay City, Saginaw and sever
al smaller places are vitally interested
In a movement Inaugurated by Thos.
P. Whittier of Saginaw, seeking for the
enforcement of state and federal laws
which prohibit the depositing of sewage
and other waste in the rivers. TheChas
petitions have been circulated less than
a week and already a thousand signers
have been secured of the five thousand
desired, so that it will be readily seen
that there is some interest in the plan.
The petitious are unaddres&ed as yet as
it is not definitely known to whom
they should be directed. Mr. Whittier
says of his proposal: "The interests of
the public health and an effective
method of ending the large destruction
of fish life in the Saginaw valley are
the ends we desire to attain.
"Three sources principally account
for the presence of the filth that con
taminates the Saginaw river city sew
age, the deposits of chemical waste bi
products from the Dow chemical plant
at Midland, and the deposits of mineral
chemical bi-products from the several
sugar beet factories along the river.
To these might be added, or classed in
with the second division above men
tioned, the overflow of salt solutions
from the uncorked salt wells abandoned
soma years ago.
"Authentic figures which I can pro
duce show that every year the human
excrement sent down from Flint alone
by the outlet of the Flint sewers into
the Flint river amounts to 365 carloads
of 30 tons each or thirty tons every
day. Then the other smaller towns
contribute perhaps as much, if not
more than Flint, and Saginaw contri
butes more than Flint in addition, all
of which is sent down to Bay City be
fore it reaches its ultimate destination.
The chemical works are daily dumping
huge quantities of lime " products into
the river, and from . the- sugar- beet
factories come such residues from wash
waters, and chemical treatments as po
tash, Uma1' hydrates and sulphates and
PruFslan - blue, which is used in the
coloring processes at the sugar fac
tories. Prussian blue is nothing else
than cyanide of iron nsed as a precipi
tate in protosulphate of iron, and, if it
is introduced into the system and meets
just the right conditions in the stom
ach, is a deadly poison.
"The mineral poisons that contami
nate the waters of the Saginaw river
cannot be filtered out," said Mr. Whit
tier, "and I make this assertion from
my experience as a chemist. Organic
poisons and toxins are for the most part
soluble and defy filtration. Even spring
water shows an occupation of 48 bac
teria bodies per cubic centimeter at a
temperature of 17 9 degrees, and these
bacteria multiply to the number of
nearly 600,000 within three days.
"The question narrows down to the
question of prevention or cure, and it
is plainly seen that, to keep the river
reasonably free from contamination,
the contaminating influences must bi
kept out. In only one instance, and
this the case of the sugar factory at
Owosso. hag any attention been given
to the federal and state prohibitory
laws, and in this case the dumping of
bi products of the BUgar factory was
stopped by an injunction brought be
fore Judge Gage."
If the plans of Mr. Whittier should
proye successful thousands of dollars of
expense would be incurred by the
cities named in changing their sewage
systems and in providing some plan to
dispose of the waste, probably the in
etallatlon of reduction plants which it
is claimed are operated at a profit by
many cities. The increasing popula
tion of cities may someday force action
of this kind but it does not appear that
the waters of the Shiawassee are at
present polluted to any noticeable de
gree. It might, however, be well for Owos
so to keep an eye on the movement.
