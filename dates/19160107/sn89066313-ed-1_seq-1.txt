cision is reversed. Although Mayor J.
M. Batterton and members of the City
Council hae expressed themselves in
favor of appealing the case, such ac
tion is not certain, as yet, according
to City Attorney George S. Starrett.
In making his decision Judge Davis
ruled that the City Council overstep
ped its power in passing an ordinance
broader in its scope on the regulation
of cigarette sales than the stale
statutes.
Ileciileil in an Hour.
It took about an hour for the special
iudge from Saline County to decide
the case. City Attorney Starrett had
olumes of legal lore ready, but Judge
Davis stopped the city counselor's
argument to ask a question, and be
fore Mr. Starrett resumed his speech
the judge aiiounced his decision and
the ban on cigarette was at an end.
ltovlc G. Clark of AU-Baine and
Clark, attorneys for the merchants,
liused his arguments against the ordi
nance on state statutes which say that
a city cannot go beyond the state laws
in passing ordinances. The Legisla
ture has twice passed statutes regu
lating the sale of cigarettes to per
sons under IS years of age and again
in uiwng cities of the third class
power to regulate the sale of cigarettes
to minors.
.Mr. Sfnrretfs Argument.
City Attorney Starrett in defending
he ordinance held to two theories:
first, that the ordinance was in har
mony with the state statute because,
lie said, the state had not spoken as
to sales to adults. Mr. Starrett further
argued that Columbia had the right
to prohibit the sale of cigarettes under
a special statute which gives to cities
of the third class the power to regu
late th- sale of articles obnoxious or
harmful to the public health.
Judge Davis held that the state had
spoken tin the matter of cigarette
sales to adults. Ity saying that ciga
rettes should not be sold to persons
under IS years old, the legislature
ruled on sales to adults, the judge
averred. The expression of one is the
exclusion of the other, according to
Judge Davis.
Judge Davis also said that even if
the law did not touch the subject, it
would be necessary for the city to prove
In the court that cigarettes are ob
noxious and harmful to the health of
the inhabitant before the ordinance
could be sustained by Mr. Starrett's
second theory.
Judge Dislikes Cigarettes.
In announcing his opinion Judge
Davis said:
"I am opposed to the use of ciga
rettes. I do not eve like the smell of
them. Iiut these cases must be de
cided by law and the ordinance is
plainly in violation of state statutes.
The thing for the city to do is to go
to the Legislature and obtain the
power to regulate cigarette sales to
adults."
Kegarding the decision of Judge
Davis Boyle (i. Clark said this after
noon: "There has never beon any doubt
w hatever in my mind that the cigarette
ordinance which prohibited the sale
to minors and adults was invalid.
The statutes and the court decisions
are plain on that question. The city,
though, has authority under the state
law to prohibit the sale to minors
generally and not merely minors un
der IS years of age and this statute
was first discussed in connection with
the cigarette ordinance by us in the
argument of the case.
"The Legislature hasn't yet in this
state prohibited the sale of cigarettes
in Missouri to adults or given the
cities of Missouri that right and of

A temporary organization of a state

agricultural auditorium. Dr. K. H.
Bullock of Edina was elected tempora
rary chairman and J. Kelly Wright,
temporary secretary. The congress
empowered the chairman to appoint
fifteen men to select a time and place
and issue a call for a meeting to form
a permanent organization.
Resolutions were drawn up to the
effect that farmers must put an end
to conditions which have brought about
the worst live stock markets during
the last few months that have ever
been known. The resolutions say that
the gravest crisis in the history of
the American farm confronts the
farmer, that the meat packers' com
bine, the dealing in grain futures and
j other like burdens are robbing rami
life of its pleasure and profit.
To change conditions an immediate
organization of a farm club in every
school district in the state, mass meet
ings of farmers in every county, and
a county farmers' association, are
urged.
