The joint meeting of the port
commission and . the citizens
was held Friday evening at the
council chambers fpr the iur
1 pose of discussing and submit
ting all the facts and data in
r . , w i
sunnort of an official survey of I.
. , . . "
the Yaquina harttor and bar, ac- ,
cording to the request of the U.
S. board of engineers jib pub-
lished recenUy The meeUng
was well attended by the busi-
nesa men or tne town ana sur-
loundine country. The meet
. i
ing was called to order by Cap
tain Jacobson, president of the
port commission, who acted as
chairman of the Joint meeting.
.A. Kirkland was elected r,ecre
tary. The chairman briefly
stated the object of the meeting
and called on Hon. B. F. Jones
for some remarks on the ques
tion at issue. The following
gentlemen were appointed a
committee to gr.ther statistics
and data for the use of our del
egation In Congress: B. F.
Jones, R. A. Bensell, S. G. Irvin,
L. C. Smith and M. Wveant. Mr.
Jones was made chairman of the
committee. Mr. Jones has
made a study of the Yaquina Bay
harbor and Its improvements for
years. He therefore prepared a
resolution supporting It and ar
guments asking the Board of U.
S. Engineers to recommend an
official survey of the Yaquina
harbor and bar. This resolu
tion was adopted by unanimous
vote. This resolution, with all
other facts connected with the
matter will be sent at once to
.Washington, D. C. Col. E. Hofer
"was present and, by invitation,
made a very able speech in fa
yor of the improvement Mr.
Hofer thought the improvement
of Yaquina harbor and bar had
been shamefully neglected. He
thought not only Lincoln county
but all of the great Willamette
valley should unite in urging the
improvement of this harbor.
Water transportation is the
cheapest and by deepening the
channel over the bar the pro
ducts of Western Oregon could
be shipped to the markets of the
world over this route. He sug
gested that the peopre of New
port and Yaquinabay unite in
jawing up a map ana place on
that map Just whit they want
done in thi w, fc-.eJ??i
done in the way of harbor and
nver improvements for the next
five years and then work to se
cure it We must be united. "I
am interested," said the Col.,
and expect to spend my last
aays on earth at my Agate
Beach cottage overlooking the
blue Pacific," and he hoped
to see the last sunset beyond the1
western sky. Mayor Bensell, S.
O. Irvin, Fred Whitten, M. Wy
gant and other made speeches
W support of the survey and fur
ther improvement of the harbor
