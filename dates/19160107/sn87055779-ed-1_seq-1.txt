Government's Position cn
Conscription Shown to bd
Stronger Than Was
Supposed.
CARSON STARTS FIGHT
ON ASQUITH CABINET
Martial Law Throughout Is
land May be Result Are
Four Vacancies in
the Government.
'utTnnth.nnl News Service:
LONDON. Jan. 7. Although the
trades unionists are throwing their
Htreugth against conscription and a
fac'.ion of the unionist party, led by
Sir Eelward Carson, has opened a
H ,'ht to overthrow the Asquith cab
inet, the passage of the military ser
vice bill on first reading in com
mons by a vote of 40? to 105 shows
that the position of the government
on compulsory service is stronger
than was supposed.
The anti-eonscriptionlsts had ex'
pected at least 140 votes against the
measure and possibly 145.
"We have not yet begun to fight,"
is the cry of the anti-conscriptionists,
who declare that a general election
is looming nearer every day.
Strikes Arc Hinte!.
Veiled threats by labor leaders
that a railroad strike and perhaps
a codi strike will follow if conscrip
tion is put into effect are met with
the stern possibility that martial law
may be proclaimed throughout the
United Kingdom with a military gov
ernment taking th place of the
pre-sent unioist government.
The Northcliffe newspapers which
have been fighting for conscription,
are now turning their guns on a new
target. They are demanding that
Ireland be Included.
If the conscriptionist newspapers
and the anti-Asquith faction of the
unionists are successful in bringing
about a crisis on the conscription
issue a general election will be prac
tically certain. But followers of
Mr. Asquith are sure that an elec
tion can be averted.
Four Vacancies.
A partial reorganization of the
ministry is in sight even if the ad
herents of Sir' Edward Carnon are
not successful in their tight to oust
the AsquKh cabinet. There are nofc
four vacancies in the government
with tii'.s possibility of more in the
near fut ire.
The positions vacant are:
Home secretaryship, which was
given up b Sir John Simon, and the
following posts which were vacated
yesterday:
Presidency of the board of educa
tion, tinder-secretaryship for home
affairs and tie oftlce of lord com
missioner of the treasury.
The resignation of Arthur Hender
son as president of the board of edu
cation did not come as any surprise.
He is a laborite and when the Na
tional Labor congress went on rec
ord against conscriptions he was ex
pected to give up office.
Against CoivstTiptioii.
William Brace, former parliamen
tary under-sretary for home af
fairs, and George II. Roberts, former
lor l commissioner of the treasury,
are both strong anti-conscriptionists.
Walter Kunciman, president of the
board f trade, and Reginald McKen
na. chancellor of the exchequer, still
retain their portfolios, but rumors
that they will quit will not down.
An analysis of the first ote on
conscription in commons shows that
Mr. Asquith retained nearly the full
strength of the liberal party while
many unionists supported his mil
itary program. A number of Irish
nationalists did not vote, although
their party leader. John Redmond,
had given orders to vote against the
measure.
The conscription bill will he up for
second reading next Tueslay.

PUMPING ENGINE NEEDED
STATES CHIEF SIBREL
Would Aid in Fighting Fires
in Outskirts Where Water
Pressure is Weak.
Needs Aerial Truck.
Mounts for the sergeant patrol
man and an additional combination
police patrol and ambulance were
the principal recommendations for
19 DI made by Chief of Police Mil
lard F. Kerr at the meeting of the
board of safety Friday morning.
Chief Irving Sibrel of the lire de
partment urged the addition of a 75
foot aerial motor truck and an auto
pumping engine in his recommenda
tions which were also submitted to
the board.
In discussing the recommenda-
tion regarding horses for the patrol
sergeants, Chief Kerr declared it to
be almost a necessity because of the
great amount of territory that must
be covered by the men. He believes
that by mounting the sergeants,
work will be facilitated and that the
department will be made more el!i-
cient. He quoted as example cities
in California, where all the patrol
men are mounted, showing that a
greater amount of work can be done
with a lesser number of men in a
more proiieient manner. He also
pointed to the movement in Kansas
City and other cities where automo
biles are being provided for the pa
trolmen, two men to a car.
Need Ambulance.
Chief Kerr's recommendation for
d second combination ambulance
and patrol is expected to be consid
ered seriously by the board In tho
near future. The same recom
mendation was made in 1913 but
was tabled by the board. The reason
fc'iven by Chief Kerr for wanting the
new patrol is because of emergency
work of all kinds which cannot be
handlfd by the present equipment.
In his request for a 75-foot aerial
truck Chief Sibrel deelar d that tho
present three-horse truck was prac
tically worn out and was in a bad
state of repair. He believes that
the upkeep of the new truck would
be about half what the present
eciuipnunt cosLs.
That a motor pumping truck
would aid in saving much property
on the outskirts of th eity was the
substance of Chief SibrcTs reasons
for asking for the pumping ap

in Chief
Kerr's
i'ecomnn ndutloüs made t"
b,ird of saf ty Fr;d y for
the
1 1 1 3
include tile fulh :n; :
lluises for three patrol ser
geants. The addition of a combination
amuldance and police patrol.
More room f,,r the Rcrtillon
and linger print departments.
Sub-station building for the
police department at the Inter
state fair grounds.
Suitable light in front of city
hall for seekers of police sta

as follows:
Addition of a 7"-foot aerial
motor truck to r place three
horse service trmk.
Addition of an auto pumping
engine.
Six additional 'irr men.
to your honorable l ody that mora
room be prowded for this depart
ment. I lesire at this time to call your
attention to the lu-cessity of a uh
poliee station at the fair grounds,
and I would suggest that the i.iatt.r
be taken up with the fair ass.acia-
: tion. A suitable building could be
j put up at v ry little expense,
I would saggest that a suitable
j light be installed at the northwest
corner of the city hall, as this would
help the public to locate the polico
station.
I beg to su-'g- st that the patrol
sergeants l,e mounted; by doing this
the patrol serge ants could em er
their territory three or four tinoy,
while they are coering it once on
j foot, and the patrol st a -eants being"
mounted could keep in ( joer touch
with the patrolmen under their
jurisdiction.
In conclusion, I wish to extend t
your honorable body and to his
honor the mayor, and to the honor
aide members of t lie common eouncil
my sincere thanks for eourtey
shown and support given me ;lluI thn
