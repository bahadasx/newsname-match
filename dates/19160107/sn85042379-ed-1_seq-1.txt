NEW PASTOR ARRIVES.
Rev. R. D. Brittain, the new pas

churches.
Before coming here, Rev. Brittain
held pastorates in Kansas City, Mis

Mount Ayr, Iowa, Robinson, Illinois,
and Holton, Kansas, and word of his
good work in this field preceded his
coming here. He was born and

MURDERER COMMITS SUICIDE.
After committing one of the most
brutal crimes in the history of North
Dakota, Bruce Parkinson committed
suicide at Ray, N. D., December 31,
after having murdered Mrs. A. M.
Hart and her two sons, Vaughn, 9,
and Roy 13, by crushing their skulls
with an iron bar at the Hart farm
near Ray, Wednesday, December 29.
Mystery shrouds the true identity
of Parkinson or Guy Hall and the
coroner is holding the body in an
ticipation of word from the Washing
ton state reformatory from which in
stitution the man is supposed to have
escaped.
That he had planned taking his
own life was ascertained when it was
found that he had purchased a re
volver in Ray Thursday, after having,held
driven into town from the scene of
the terrible murder.
It was also learned that he threat
ened Miss Grace McFarlane with the
.weapon, when he went there Friday
with Violet and Doris Hart, whom
he had forced to kee P àn awful vi e n
Thursday night beside the mutilated
corpse of their mother. Bliss Mc
Farlane, a brother, drove the dement

Parkinson or Hall was 21 years of
age and is said to have claimed Se
attle as his home.

Cartoons by Charles L. Bartholo
mew, known the world over as "Bart"
will be features of the Courier begin
ning with this issue. Every week a
cartoon from his pen will appear in
this paper.
"Bart's" cartoons are famous for
their smiling, optimistic outlook of
life, combined with a punch that hits
the mark.
They powerfully illustrate the
news of the day, for "Bart" has the
skill of a master cartoonist and witk
it, the keen perception which he
gained early as a newspaper repor
ter. Readers of the Minneapolis
J/jurnal will never forget his car
W. E. Davis, a prominent rancher
on the Missouri river, died last week
at Rochester, Minnesota, where he
had gone to secure treatment, but ow
ing to the advanced stage of his case,
the surgeons did not operate and
death resulted. The body was shipped
to Glasgow and the funeral was held
Monday.
At seven o'clock this morning Mrs.
I. H. Dawson passed away at the
Deaconess hospital following a ser
ious illness. About a week ago she
was taken to the hospital and it was
thought her condition was improving,
but her death came suddenly, probab
ly due to heart failure. About fif
teen minutes before her death a
nurse had been in the room and at
seven o'clock, when another nurse
C.jwent in, she found that Mrs. Dawson
breathed her last. Her husband
and three boys, Claude, Louis and
Richard, two sisters, a brother, and
her mother survive her. The fun
eral will be held at 2:30 Sunday af
ternoon from the Christian church
of which the deceased was a charter
member. Mr. Dawson and the chil
dren have the sympathy of the entire
community in their bereavement.
HIGH PRICES FOR CATTLE.
Prices for beef cattle the coming
spring are going to be unusually high,
m the opinion of D. C. Raymond, sec
retary of the Montana state livestock
board, who has recently returned
from a trip to Chicago. Mr. Raymond
believes that eastern Montana stock
men who have been wintering cattle
are going to make a large profit
when the animals are sold next
spring.
During the past six weeks there
have been extraordinarily heavy runs
of medium weight cattle and light
hogs on the Chicago market, from
those districts which heretofore have
engaged extensively in winter feed
ing for the February and March mar
ket.
"I met many of the Chicago com
mission men as well as the shippers,"
said Mr. Raymond in an interview
given out on his return to Montana.
"They informed me that the runs are
due to the soft corn. In practically
all the corn country northward from
a line 50 miles south of Chicago, the
corn is soft. It is milky, the cattle
don't like it, and instead of making
the customary gains in many in
stances they weigh less than when
toons in that paper, and he has been
ranked as one of the leading car
toonists of the country. He left this
paper and went into business for him
self and now many of the leading pa
pers in the country are running his
cartoons.
Dr. Albert Shaw, editor of Reveiw
of Reviews, speaking of "Bart's"
work, said:
"Mr. Charles L. Bartholomew has
not merely a very ingenious and
rv ^v rpencil, but he has a remarkable
political instinct that makes his
drawings, to a very unusual extent,
valuable as elucidating a situation."
at this price. 1
they were placed on feed.
"All at once feeders awakened to
a realization of the condition that
confronted them. They began dump
ing their cattle on the market, as well
as the hogs which they had counted
on fattening after the steers. This
accounts for the demoralization of
both the cattle and the hog markets
at the present time.
"As a result of this condition the
buyers will be unable to obtain their
supply of spring beef from their cus
tomary sources and must look else
where.
"Montana feeders should reap the
benefit of the scarcity that is bound
to prevail. Information received by
this office, however, is that only from
one-half to two-thirds as many cattle
are being fed in the state as last
year. Many Montana feeders lost
money on their operations last year
and the year before. This is one rea
son why fewer cattle are being fed.
Another is that in some parts of the
state the hay crop was spoiled. A
third reason is because bankers, who
were carrying some of the feeders in
previous years, absolutely declined to
advance a dollar for the purchase of
any cattle costing over six cents a
pound. The cattle were not to be had
MANY AUTOS IN STATE.
From the first of April, 1915 to
January 1 of this year, 14,520 auto
mobile registrations were tabulated
in the office of Secretary of State A.
M. Alderson, an increase of 5,000
over 1914. At the beginning of last
year, Secretary of State Alderson
predicted there would be 14,500 ma
chines.
The fiscal year for automobile reg
istrations does not expire until April
1, 1916. All persons who purchased
automobiles before that date will be
required to register, and then they
must register again for the fiscal
year of 1916, the law requiring one
registration a year.
The records in Mr. Alderson's of
fice show that there are 870 motorcy
cles, a total of over 15,000 motor ve
hicles in Montana. This number prob
ably represents practically all of the
cars in Montana and it is not likely
that very many more will be pur
chased between now and April 1.
Blanks for registration will be
mailed out in a short time to all au
tomobile owners. The money received
for the registration will amount to
between $20,000 and $35,000 and will
be used for the betterment of state
highways.
Secretary of State Alderson esti
mates that there will be an increase
in the number of cars next year of
probably 5,000, making the total num
ber of autoirpbiles in Montana in
1917, more than 28,000. They have
been increasing at the rate of about
5,000 per year ever since the passage
of the registration law.

commission announces that an exami
nation will be held in this city Feb

GEORGE BALL MAY
GETNEW TRIAL
Washington Government Requests
Stay of Execution.
A dispatch from Ottawa, Ontario,
dated January 5, declares that the
Canadian government has received a
note from the Wilson administration
at Washington. It asks that a re
prieve be granted to George Ball,
who was to have been hanged next
Thursday at Saskatchewan for the
murder of William Long last August.
The request has been acceded to and
the execution postponed for a month
to give the American authorities the
opportunity of adducing new evidence.
Readers of the Courier are undoubted
ly familiar with the case, and since
his trial and conviction in .Canada,
Ball's friends on this side have been
working hard to secure a stay of ex
ecution. Ball, it is alleged, shot Wil
liam Long on his (Ball's) land in
Canada. Ball then came across the
line and told of the killing, stating
that it was in self-defense. He want
ed to give himself up to the authori
ties at Malta, but the case was out
of their jurisdiction and Ball was
taken over into Conada. His trial
was held at Sweet Grass and a num
ber of ranchers and officials from
this part of the state were summoned
as witnesses. He was found guilty
of murder and was sentenced to be
hanged.
HOMESTEAD LAW CHANGE.
Senator Walsh has introduced a bill
providing that all pending homestead
entries made in good faith prior to
January 1, 1916, under the enlarged
homestead laws by persons who, be
fore making such enlarged homestead
entry, had acquired title to land under
the homestead laws and were not
qualified to make an enlarged home
stead entry shall be validated if, in
all other respects regular in all cases,
the original homestead entry was for
less than 160 acres.
Senator Myers has introduced a bill
providing that in all cases where In
dians have taken or may hereafter
take homesteads or have been- or may
hereafter be allotted lands on the
public domain they and their families
and descendants shall not thereby for
feit their rights to the lands and
funds of the tribe to which they be
long.
Senator Myers has introduced a bill
amending the law pertaining to cul
tivation by entrymen of homestead
lands. It provides that the entryman
shall, in order to comply with the re
quirements of cultivation, cultivate
not less than one-sixteenth of the
area of his entry, beginning with the
second year of the entry, and not less
than one-eighth, beginning with the
third year of the entry and until final
proof, except that in the case of en
tries under the enlarged homestead
law double the area of cultivation
shall be required. When the lands en
tered are covered with a growth of
poles, brush and scrub timber the en
tryman in lieu of cultivation required
may make improvements upon his en
try by slashing, clearing or in any
other way preparing the land for cul
tivation, said improvements to aggre
gate not less than $150. The provi
sion as to cultivation shall not apply
to entries under the act of April 28,
li»04, the Kinkaaid act, or entries un
der the reclamation act.
CLUB ELECTS
NEW OFFICERS
Annual Meeting of Commercial
Club Held Tuesday Night.
GOOD RESULTS OBTAINED
J. W. Wedum Elected President, T. J.
Hocking, Vice President and
R. M. Young Treasurer.
The annual meeting of the Com
mercial club was held Tuesday even
ing in the club rooms and despite
the extremely cold weather, the at
tendance was very good, and repre
sented the various business interesta
of the city.
The report of the secretary on the
work of the club during 1915 and
the election of officers for the ensu
ing year, occupied the greater part
of the evening.
The secretary's report was well re
ceived by all the members and wan
approved. The report, briefly con
densed, shows that the club, while
losing some members, this was coun
ter balanced by the new members
taken in during the year, so that at
the end of the year the club was in
very good financial circumstances.
The assets and liabilities showed a
balance in favor of the club of $102.73.
The report showed that there were
307 memberships on the roll and that
the club is in a position to do good
work the ensuing year and its mem
bership can be considerably augment
ed by bringing in those men in the
city who are not members now. The
secretary recommended an immediate
whirlwind campaign for memberships,
which will, no doubt, be immediately
taken up by the new board of direct
ors and the membership of the club
greatly increased at once. The work
to be done the coming year was out
lined by the secretary, and among
the important matters toward which
the club will devote its attention are
the securing of a sugar beet factory
at Glasgow, a creamery, a foundry, a
produce exchange, cold storage plant
an<T many other industries of this na
ture.
Over 2,600 people had called at the
club rooms the past year, according
to the report and 5,000' pieces of mail
had been sent out, not including the
notices to local mémbers of meetings
or other communications within the
county. Advertising literature was
sent to the immigration and railroad
offices in eastern cities and articles
have appeared in many of the eastern
daily, weekly and monthly magazines
covering the resources and develop
ment of Glasgow and Valley county.
After hearing the report, the elec
tion of officers was held and J. W.
Wedum was elected president, T. J.
Hocking, vice president, and R. M.
Young, treasurer. All the officers
were unanimously elected by acclama
tion. The board of Directors will be
appointed by the new President.
Following the election of officers,
the retiring president, J. L. Truscott,
was tendered a vote of thanks and ap
preciation for the time and labor that
he had given to the work of the club
during the past two years that he has
been president and the members all
recognized the fact that much of the
success of the club work was largely
due to his untiring efforts and his
activity and they likewise realized
that he has sacrificed a great deal of
his own personal time and greatly
inconvenienced himself in order to
carry on the labor of the club.
The members of the board of direc
tors were also given a hearty vote of
thanks for their work in behalf of the
club and their willingness to devote
a certain portion of their time to the
duties which their office required of
them, shows that not only the Presi
dent, but every official of the Com
mercial club has always stood ready
to spend not only time but money, if
necessary to promote the welfare arid
assist in developing the city of Glas
gow.
A vote of thanks was also extended
to Secretary S. C. Moore for his ad
mirable work in that position during
the past year. A large portion of the
success of the club is due to his un
tiring efforts, and the members all
seemed to feel that he is the right
man in the right place.
