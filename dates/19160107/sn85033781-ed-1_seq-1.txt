No. If you get along without it; if
you have no spiritual needs which the
church alone can meet; if you have no
passion for service which can be exer

church; if you have no love for Jesus
which draws you irresistably to that in
stitution for which He shed His blood,
then you should not j in the church.
No. If th church itself is not neces
sarv to the community in which you live;
if you should be oil II Of to live Hnd rear
your children where the church bells
never toll, where the voice of worship
is n 'V r heard, and .v-hre the ideals of

Didn't Waft the Attack.
At Boulogne during a royal reception
soma years ago a number of English
ladles In their anxiety to see every
thing pressed with such force against
the ooUaon who were keeping the line
that the soldiers were forced to give
way and generally were, as policemen
say, "hindered in the execution of
their duty." The officer in command,
observing the state of affairs, called
out: ,40ne roll of the drum! If they
don't Stand back kiss them nil!" After
tho first sound of the drum the ladles
took to flight.
"If they had been French," said a
Parisian jourmil, "they would have re
mained to a woman."
