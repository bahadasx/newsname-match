!n 1908 the General Assembly of Ken
tucky Passed a Constitutional
Amendment Permitting the State to
Lend Its Credit to the Counties for
Roadbullding and Maintenance.
Frankfort. Kentucky was on3 ol
the first states In the union, to estab
lish state aid for road construction.
As early as 1810 the General Assembly
of Kentucky provided for the open
ing of roads to the Virginia line and.
began the construction of macadam
ized roads in 1820.
Prior to 1840, Kentucky had spent
more than $2,000,000 in the construe
tion of macadamized roads which"
were built on rights of way sixty feet
wide. These roads were located on
light grades and easy curves, and
were graded twenty-four to thirty feet
between ditches. Teirord foundation?
between sixteen aud twenty-four feat
were used with a good macadam sur
face. ThiB work was under the super
vision of a state engineering depart
ment, consisting of a state higha
engineer, at a salary of S3.000 per
year, with a corps ot assistants at
salaries ranging from S1.100 to $2,500
per annum. Many of these roads are:
yet in a splendid state of preservation
and are rendering substantial service
to the communities through which
they pass.
However, the policy of internal im
provement was discontinued prior to
1850, owing to the financial condition
of the treasury, and a change in po-i
litical parties, and it was not until
1908 that any attempt was made to re
rive a state system of highways.
In 190S the General Assembly of
Kentucky passed a constitutional
amendment permitting the state to
lend Its credit to the counties for road
building, and to provide for the con
struction and maintenance of public
highways.
A highway department was estab
lished to consist of the Commissioner
t)t Public Roads and such -asdlaUtntd
as the Governor might deem advisa
ble, with an appropriation of not to
exceed $20,000 per annum from the
automobile license tax which had been
accruing from 191o as a state road
fund.
The department was organized and
Robert C. Terrell was appointed the
first commissioner. The duties of the
department were purely advisory, and
while the counties were required to
request plans, specifications and esti
mates of cost for the road and bridge
work, which exceeded $500 in cost,
they were not compelled to use the
plans and specifications thus prepared.
It was not until after the state aid
law passed by the General Assembly
of 1914 became operative that the
state was really in a position to lend
material aid to the counties. Although
a great deal was accomplished by the
commissioner and his assistants prior
to 1910, it was only, as stated above,
advisory, which in many instances it
was hard to get the county ofllcials
to take advantage of the engineering
assistance offered, but in 1914 the gen
eral assembly passed a law levying a
five-cent tax on each $100 worth of tax
able property in the state of Kentucky.
The law further provided that the
money should be distributed to the
counties baaed upon the amount of
money levied and collected in each
county for roadbullding, and that no
county should receive in any one year
more than two per cent of the total
road fund. The department imme
diately set to work in the spring of
1915 to secure the co-operation of the
counties in building a system of roads
as laid out in the bill passed by the
Geaeral Assembly, which provided
that the roads should connect up the
county seat of each county of the Com
monwealth with the county seats ot
the adjoining counties by the most
direct and practical route, and the
county seats of border counties with
the state line on the most direct and
practical routes leading from said
county seats to the county 3eats ot
the adjoining counties In the adjacent
Btates.
(By Hon. James B. McCreary,
Governor of Kentucky.)

KbTjds was advocated by me wrn
I was- a candidate for Governor of
Kentucky. After 1 was eiected 1
recommended in my message to th
General Assembly the enactment of
a law providing for a Department

This can never be an ideal cru
to live in until it is interlaced witj a
network of highways and the high
ways so marked as to direct the trav
eler which road to take to reach his
destination.
A man who is opposed to road im
provement is worth about as much to
a locality as a safety razor is to a col
ored man at a Georgia picnic.
Why not nationalize highways
