The only lighting of speoial notice has
been along the 'Russian front and out
ride of the fact, .we team but little in de
tail, though the Russians claim some
rsuocees.
The diplomatic situation 'between the
'United States and .Austria ieretill serious.
VWithin a dew days after Austria had
(practical!? qaologized for the sinking of
•the "Anoona" by a sabasaone without
warning, and diplomats began .'to see an
•opportunity er settlement, another ship,
the "Persia" carrying Americans as pas
sengers* including Mr. Robert AlcNeely,
an Amerioan consul, proceeding to his
post, was torpedoed without warning
and a considerable number were
drowned.
The details «f this-second disaster are
wery.elow coming in but at this writing,
it seems quite oertain'.tbat Mr. MdNeely
wasawictim.
a
[M
On the face of what \we know itttakes
venytgrave situation, ae it would Jook
«s if iaitria proposed .to sink asaaany
ehips asoshe pleases and a^xlogize after
warda though in «U these cases it *.ill
be well for the public tto wait for par
ticalars before forauAg oipioions, whkii
ieitbe prooedure at Washington.
The question of eonscrvtion is mom
before the British padiameot with a
Btoeng probability of being put in force.
These is a vc*y strong feeling against it
aeaoag the working ctonses and if en
forced there i« likely to be political if
not greater troubles there.
Congsssa shows symptoau «t dipping
into the diplomatic work. While there
is a straag temptation this presiden
tial year to make capital at the expense
of tha deaiocratie administration we
hope aad believe that the leaden of the
Repablican party will try to inaka all
congreasionsl debases on the platforu
of "America lint" rather than "party

Does England really want America to
join the entente allies?
Would it benefit Great Britian if Ate
United States were foroed into war frith
Germany?
What would be the result to America
if 'Germany were completely successful?
While the answers vary to some ear
tent, they are however practically 'un
animous in sentiment. All assume 'that
the present war is democracy vs. kaiser
ism and therefore .America shotifld io
sentiment at least ifavor the causeof the
entente allies.and some declare that.Am
erica should at once join the conflict.
All who answer -the questions at all
predict trouble for America in case'of
German victory,
:8ome of the writerfe say directly and
some inferential lyittbat he United States
'has not already joined the allies because
of commercial reasons.
It is the latter phase of th&answers
that we would speaik of at the present
time.
0?he Unrted States has what lis .called
a Monroe doctrine. While in -some of
its .phases this 'doctrine is capable of
•various interpretations the underlying
principle is, that it is to the national in
terest of the United States and its duty
as the largest nation on the continent to
see-that noEuropeaa.nation sball be al
lowed to seize or control any part of this
continent, other than that already so
controled. This doctrine has nerer been
fully accepted ini&urope including-Great
Britian, but it-is without doubt the ac
cepted, opinion of the United States.
This doctrine when stated tbus-affirm
atively has .nothing to do with countries
of .Eorppe in .Europe.
.Negatively -however, the cotallary is
•that while the United-States believesit
has the right and duty of looking after
Pan-America interests on thisoontinet
it therefore has no right nor duty to .in
iterfere with-strictly [European affairs.
Since Washihgton delivered his tfare
iwell address this has been the doctrine
.andprocedure .of the United States, of
vwhich there are many historical
.aiqples.
ex-
That the United States declines to en
ter the war for commercial reasons is
«uqply a slander and inonsense. IDhat
there are some manufacturers that are
profiting by thenar is true. It may .be
some.of these favor the continuation of
the .war. But .we think -even these are
fear, while the great bulk of our peqple
are dot manufacturers and there are
laage .numbers of our citisens to whom
the jiresent results of the war are
damage and there are but lew thin King
people who do not believe that America
in the .end will have io help ,pay for tbe
enormous losses caused by tbe war.
Speaking of commercialism however,
reminds us that a little over a half
century .ago there was a war in this
country. To a large extent, commercial
ly, it was war 'between the producers
of cotton .and tbe northern cotton fac
tories.
Then the sympathies of all .of Eng
land's great cotton factory towns as
well as great numbers of other interest
ed people were with tbe south. The
theory beiag that with the collapse of
the republic of tbe United Stated ihat
the cotton of the south would go to
England for manufacture aad tbe trade
ol the northern states be lost to them.
Great Britian paid after the war soaae
530,000,00 indemnity for losses caused by
ita criminal negligence in titting out pri
vateeu for the southerners while, until
stopped by a Strang blockade England
sent a steady line of blockade runners
from tbe Bahamas to the southern
states.
Not all of England was against the
north, but a' large part of that commer
cial country was in sympathy with the
south for purely commercial reasons.
And the Civil War of the United
8totes was just as much a war lor liberty
and democracy asia the present war
and in oar opinion the present European
I
controversies in its own land, it is for
Europe to light out its own Cohtroversisaj
on its own side of the water.
But if the United States does eoti|
Jthe European war it will not be as an
ally of the entente, but because it haf
questions of its own to settle that. can
not be settled in any other way.

Vew Year's day, seven states of the
Union went dry: Arkansas, Washington,
Idaho, South Carolina^ Iowa, Colorado
Oregon. In each eafe, this was#th« re
sult of a stete-wMe vote- of the' people.
Probibitibn is already in force in eleven
States: Maine, T^nueame, Mis
«is#fppi, Arizona, Noith Carolina. West
Virginia, Georgia, North. Dakot* Okla
homa and Alabasna. West Virginia has
declared for state-wide prohibition but
it does not go into effect until Nov. 1st.,
1916. There ate thus nineteen states
which will be diy in tha year 1916.
In addition," votes are to be taken oil

Some people, particularly these of the
liquor interest* call this great move
ment a "wave" or •'flood" and, $hat like
all water movements, it will recede agaio.
They are making a huge mistake.
This prohibiten movement the direct
result of about hundred years of edu
cation. This educational movement he
gan about a century ago, butiit has been
during the last fifty years that the move
ment has grow9|9 rapidly that it now
bids fair to enfr£w|e the whale world in
a short time. .•
For the last twenty»five yean, the
young have been educated ia-echools an4
elsewhere until every boy and girl in
most states has learned tbe effect of al
cohol on mind and body, an5 on eociety.
These boys, and in some statoe, the girls,
are now yoteis. Public sentiment is lar
gely a matter «f education. The public
has learned that it is no trouble to do
without liquor, but thal there is lots of
trouble connected with its use. The ver
diet is the -result of the knowledge of
the fact. 'A'ik

PAOSPERITYf
We have repeatedly been told through
press dispatches and articles published
for political reasons that the railroads
are making more money thai they have
been for many years and that busineas is
above normal io nearly all lines of ooih
merce. Here in North Dakota the trunk
lines have taken off scores of trains and
the branch feeders are only operated
with sufficient trains to com(i)y with the
laws of tbe state. Does these things
agree? We have the actual evidence
here in Pembina where a number of
train orews were laid off in the early part
of the season when traffic should be on
tbe increase.
iFrom the "Railroad Age Gazette a
publication as authentic on railroad
matters as the "Scientific Amerioan" is
on .matters of nwentiona *e cqpy .the
folloanjhg whiqb i{iK8 to show (bat busi
nees is not above normal, biit on tthe oon*
trary it is a repetition of 'what we bad

the early 90's, but with thi* difference,
