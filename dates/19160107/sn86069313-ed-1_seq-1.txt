SINKING OP LINER PERSIA PRE
8ENT8 NEW INTERNATION
AL CRISIS.
SUNK WITHOUT WARNING
President Wilson Hurries Back To
Washington To Confer
' With Lenders.
Washington, Jan. 4. Tho now
submnrlno crisis was practically at a
standstill today while tho govern
ment awaited developments of the
exact facta of the operations of tho
Teutonic submerslblcs in tho Medi
terranean. Late today, after conferring with
President Wilson, Secretary Lansing
sent orders to tho American consuls
at Alexandria, Malta and Cairo to
gather at onco all available affidavits
from the Persia survivors and to
cable summaries.
The idea Is to bring in definite in
formation speedily.
There were evidences that admin
istration leaders, whllo not In the
least minimizing the dangers and
possibilities of the latest complica
tions brought on by tho destruction
of the llnor Persia, were anxious
that the public mind should not bo
Inflamed further while tho Presi
dent and his advisers wero trying to
suspend Judgment and all the agen
cies of tho government were In mo
tion to collect all tho factB upon
which the next movo may bo made.
Secretary Tumulty
Issued .this
statement from tho President:
"Tho President and tho Secrotary
of State are taking every means
possible to obtain tho full facts in
this grave matter and will act Just
&i soon as tho information Is ob
tained." For the first timo slnco foreign
relations became delicate during tho
war, President Wilson today conferr
ed with the leaders of tho Congres
sional committees which deal with
tho subject, and It was afterward an
nounced that they wero to be ad
vised of the steps and developments
InJtho situation.
This action met the approbation
of many Senators and Representa
tives who have been contending that
in such a serious situation as the pres
ent promises to become, Congress
.should be consulted In any moves
which may Involve tho country In
measures at least short of war.
Attack Deferred.
An expected attack on the admin
istration's policy probably was avoid
ed by a hasty adjournment of tho
Senate within ten minutes after it
assembled, and there was no Indica
tion of an outbreak in the House. A
meeting of the State Foreign Rela
tions Committee tomorrow, at which
the subject was expected to como up,
-was deferred until later in tho week,
awaiting further information, lead
crs said.
At tho White House and at tho
State Department the tension of tho
crisis was evident, but there was an
atniosphoro of moving carefully and
surely.
Tho President, who arrived this
morning from Hot Springs, Va., In
structed Secrotary Lansing to bring
immediately to tho White Houso any
now information which came to hand,
and then busied himself reading tho
official dispatches so far received
and getting in touch generally with
tho situation.
Tho Administration Is depending
largely on tho Inquiries which Am
bassador Penfleld has beon Instruct
ed to mako at Vienna and that which
consuls aro gathering elsewhere, to
establish tho nationality of tho sub
marlno which Is said to have Bunk
the Persia and to devojop tho facts
in tho caso generally. I
Baron Erich Zwiedlnek, tho Aus-I
trlan charge here, has asked officials
TKVt, the Washington government to
,1 Withhold Judgment until all the
1 o.to urn nf )innri.xanil is said to
''have given assurances that If an

EXPENSES OF TRIP TO GIVE
TESTIMONY JARS BRYAtf
New York, Jan. 4. William Jen
nings Bryan vigorously protested to
day against the law of New York
State, because he was required to
come here at his own expense and
give testimony In a -suit for libel.
"I am here under duress," declar
ed Mr. Bryan, "because it is the on
ly way I can avoid contempt pro
ceedings." Mr. Bryan was examined in an ac
tion brought against a Greek news
paper. He was questioned concern
ing the sale by the United States to
Greeco ot tho old battleships Idaho
and Mississippi, but said he knew
nothing of the details. He denied
that he gave any secrets of gun fird
control to the Greek Government or
that while Secretary of State he had
seen any letter written to influence
him against Agememon Schllemann,
former Greek Minister to the Unit
ed States. He also said he had not
heard criticisms alleged to havo been
mado of him by Schllemann-.
According to Mr. Bryan, tho sale
of tho battleships was a matter which
rested entirely with the Navy De
partment. He admitted that gun
flro control secrets might have been
divulged by the Navy Department
without his knowledge or that the
State Department might have attend
ed to some details of routine work
without his personal knowledge.
Tho suit is the outgrowth of a
statement in the Greek newspaper
that the plaintiff, Petros P. Tatanls,
wrote or caused to be written a let
ter with a view to bringing about ill
feeling between Mr. Bryan and the
former Greek Minister.
