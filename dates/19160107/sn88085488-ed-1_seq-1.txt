Big Intersedional Game From Brown, 14
to o—Good as Cornell, Says Expert.
.Following is the report of the'game which appeared in the Los
Angeles Examiner. It shows the decided superiority of the W. S. C.
team in every department of the game. Though heavier, the Brown
line was outplayed from the start) while the work of the W. S. C.
backfield was scintillating in its brilliancy. But for the slippery
condition of the ball the western champions would have scored two
ntOfrriiuehdowns, eveu-;thoijgrr NTriTmi:iy--handicnpp(;d by the muddy
and sloppy field, which greatly impaired their style of play.

park, yesterday afternoon by the ,
score of 14 to 0. At the end of the <
game there was no doubt as to the
superiority of the winners. They
had demonstrated that the best in
the West is a deal better than the
East of the second class, and on a
dry fi_d their superiority would
have | been even greater. In every
department of the game the winners
had the best of the contst, but it was
largely their greater ruggedness,
greater; ability to stand the terrific
strain of the desperate battle in the

slippery going that won for them.
Throughout the first two periods
there was no scoring, the entire time
being taken up in a vreious contest
between the 20-yard lines, the ball
seldom -getting nearer than that to
either goal line, and changing hands
frequently, sometimes as the result
of a fumble, but more frequently
when the defenders held the attack
for throe downs without the requi
site 10 yards gain and forced a.
kick. |

Each time ■'* the attacking team
started in whirlwind fashion to

time th« defense stiffened after a

possession.
When the second half opened, the
Brown team commenced to show the
strain, j Her attack was not so deter

did on Washington, in that it prac

dodging open field running depends
largely upon a sure and solid foot
ing for its success. Time and again
he slipped and fell when endeavor
ing to make a quick turn or cut-in,
and he had no chance to make use
of his great speed, and was frequent
ly collared for a loss, when on a dry
field he would have been safely away
for a substantial gain.
Wahlngton, accustomed to using
an open form of attack, showed her
great adaptability by changing her
style to meet the conditions, and
rather than take any chances with
fancy handling of the slippery ball,
or long end runs, confined her at
tack almost entirely to tackle and
off-tackle bucks, at which she
showed unexpected ability. Her
backs ran hard and low, and hit the
line with a greater speed than any
backs seen here this season, and
their ability to pick holes was almost
uncanny. With their speed and
wriggling ability they took, advant
age of the slightest openings made
by their linemen in the opposing for
wards and slipped and slid through
for consistent gains throughout the
game, and particularly in the second
half.
W. 8. C. Line Beet
From end to end of the line, the
Washingtonians had the best of it,
with a possible exception of one of
the ends. On Brown's right wing,
Weeks played a splendid game, and
gave Dietz, on his tries at end runs
from kick formations, more trouble
than any of his line mates. The su
perior weight of the Brown forwards,
which should have been a big factor
in their favor, was more than off
set by the greater aggressiveness of
the Washington line, the Northern
guards and tackles having less and
less troublo as the game progressed
in opening beautiful holes for their
backs to drive through. And how
they* did drive! Frequently their
speed, in spite of the slush, was so
great that they shot through the
line, tripped, staggered, slipped and
fell) and still went on, carried by the
momentum of their attack. No one
man could stop a Washington back
yesterday— lt took a mobilization of
i Brown players to do it, and it was as
easy to mobilize on them as it would
be to mobilize on a fast-moving eel.

PULLMAN. WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, JANUARY 7. 1916
Open play was tabooed from the first
kickoff, A team had as much chance
yesterday to got away with the for
ward pass as a man with the palsey
would have to eat peas with his
knife. Each team tried it a couple
of times, Brown getting eight yards
with it once and then gave it up as a
mighty risky proposition. The
nearest approach to fancy stuff that
either team tried was the criss-cross,
from a half to an end, that Washing
ton used to good advantage on sev
eral occasions, Loomis being the
greatest ground gainer with it.
For the most part Durham, the
Washington quarterback, showed ex
cellent judgment by slamming his
backs, one after another, into the
left side of the line, where Captain
Clark and Applequist, In the first
half, and Clark and Finney in the
second half, although badly out
weighed by their opponents, were
always capable of making an open
ing for them.
These bucks came mostly directly
from position, there being very little
effort on the part of Washington to
cover up her attacker, or the point
at which he would be directed, at
any stage of the game. Brown, on
the other hand, usually sent at least
one man into the line ahead of the
runner, the quarterback making a
"dummy" pass to him as he dove in
to help make the hole and take off
the secondary defense. By the time
the runner got to the line the scrappy
Northern linemen had usually dis
posed of the Brown line and the fake
FOOTBALL MAD THRONGS CHEER
RETURNED GRIDIRON WARRIORS
Business Men Vie With Students in
Pulling Oil' Wildly Enthusiastic
Demonstration
Amid thu din of the wildest and
most enthusiastic, demonstration of
unqualified joy in the annals of Pull
man's history, the champion Wash
ington State College football team,
conquerors of one of the best teams
the far east affords and credited by
eminent authorities as being the
equal or superior of Cornell, which
leads the list, stepped from the train
yesterday morning and for a solid
two hours was tendered a reception
by students, townspeople, business
men, faculty, and in fact almost
every man, woman and child within
the city, which could not but prove
to the returned heroes that Pullman
and the State College, to the man,
are solidly behind them and rejoice
in their season of wonderful vic
tories.
A large bob sled was waiting when
the train pulled in and Into this
were hustled the football men, while
400 willing students grabbed the
long ropes attached to the vehicle.
Whistles and bells added their vol
ume to the general tumult and 2000
thirty-third degree football fans
craned their necks to get a better
look at their heroes.
To the music of two bands and the
clicking of innumerable cameras and
"movie" outfits, the mammoth par
ade, the result of tho Joint efforts of
the business men and college people,
moved through the business streets
bfore wending its way to the college.
Led by the college band, the big cara
van covered nearly five blocks.
Brown's goat, the result of the artis
tic disposition of Lou Curtiss and led
by that worthy himself, was much in
evidence, and proved the big hit of
the parade. There was a troop of
prominent business men, trans
formed, by the liberal use of gaudy
blankets, war paint and feathers, in
to Sioux Indians, with Mayor Harley
Jackson himself at their head. Other
redskins of Coach Dietz's tribe car
ried a huge banner on which was
printed the official coach yell, "Lone!
Star, Lone Star; Yip, Yip, Yu! How I
We Love You, Oh You Sioux." Near- j
ly a thousand college students, with {
hundreds of business men, high j
runner and were in position to nail
tho man with the ball. And they
nailed him: hard, low and sure. The
only man they couldn't bring down
on the wing was Pollard. A half
dozen times he jerked his legs up
right under him just as the tackier
dove at him, and left said tackier
with two arms full of emptiness and
his face in the mud. But the wetness
of the field did what the Washington
tacklers couldn't do, and he never
got very far. On a dry field he
would have been a riot, though, and
the spectators were cheated of a treat
by the uncertain footing he had to
contend against.
W. S. C. Has Endurance*
To sum it all up, the teams were
equal in their knowledge of the
game, equal in the mechanical per
formance and equal in their will
ingness, but the endurance, the drive
under pressure, the ability to stand
up under the gruelling strain of the
tight game on a difficult field —in
other words, the stamina which age
and experience brings, lay mostly
with Washington. It was this that
won for them; the fact that when the
time came for the teams to weaken
and slow up, for physical rower to
lessen and the flesh to respond more
slowly to the demands of the spirit,
it was the Brown team which suc
cumbed, while the Washington team
went even more strongly on its way
to the goal line. It is the power to
do this under strain that stamps a
team as great, and this hall mark of

school and grade students, men,
women and children, followed the
football heroes as they were drawn
through tho streets, while the side
walks on either side were banked
with humanity.
A vacation had been declared by
all the business houses, the college
and thu city schools, and profuse
decorations of pennants, Indian
blankets, flags and bunting bedecked
the business houses.
It was a wildly hilarious crowd,
and every man, woman and child en
tered most heartily into the spirit of
the celebration.
Proceeding to the campus the pro
cession was greeted on all sides by
enthusiastic, cheering throngs. The
wheat convention, being conducted
by grain growers, shippers and mill
ers of the Northwest, adjourned as
the procession neared the college and
the members poured out to witness
the demonstration.
Upon arriving at Bryan hall the
players were carried on the shoulders
of the students to the stage in the au
ditorium, where they were greeted
by E. A. Bryan, retiring president.
Prof. Gottfried Herbst led the col
lege band in a number of selections,
Vice' President Waller briefly praised
the team and turned the meeting
over to Paul H. Dupertius, student
president. Mark Brislawn spoke to
the team for the students, praising
the players for the most wonderful
victory a State College team has ever
won.
M. J. Chapman appeared on behalf
of the Pullman Chamber of Com
merce and in a very clever address
lauded the brains and brawn that
won for the West against the East,
presenting to some extent the public
ity that Pullman and the State Col
lege will receive from the accomplish
ment. Ex-President E. A. Bryan was
greeted vociferously when he ap
peared, the applause continuing foi
several minutes. He thanked the
players earnestly for their conduct
throughout the season and for the
sacrifices they had made to represent
the college creditably on the gridiron.

A summary of the salient points in the big New Years day battle
at Pasadena, when Washington State proved that, the far west pro
duces the best football teams in the world, shows conclusively the
superiority of Dietz's men over the far easterners. The figures,
which are compiled from the running story of the game, indicate that
Washington State is about four touchdowns better than the eastern
representatives, and but for adverse conditions the score should have
been doubled.
