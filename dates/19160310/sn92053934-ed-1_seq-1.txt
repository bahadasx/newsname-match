General ReCOmmendS Clear-IO
ing Out of Outlaws as
Only Solution.
Washington, March 10.
President Wilson today or
dered American troops over
the Mexican border to cap
ture or kill the Villa bandits
who yesterday raided Colum
bus, N. M.
Major General Scott, chief
of staff of the army, an
nounced that the expedition
would consist of not less than
5,000 men, all of which are
available on the border un
der Major General Funston.
In its present stage the
president's order does not
mean armed intervention in
Mexico. It provides for a
punitive expedition to deal
with lawless forces over
which the Carranza govern
ment has no control.
The following statement was
Issued at the White house:
"An adequate force will he sent
at once in pursuit of Villa with
the sinele object of capturing him
and putting a stop to his forays.
"This can be done and will be
done in entirely friendly aid of
the constituted authorities in Mex
ico and with scrupulous respect
for the sovereignty of that re
public." It was said at the White house that
the American government wants Villa
dead or alive and that no steps will
be neglected to carry out that object.
It was declared that the United
Slates will not consider the punitive
expedition an invasion of Mexico and
will continue to deal with the Carran
za government. The American gov
ernment is still opposed to armed in
tervention in Mexico, but has decided
that the peace of both Mexico and the
United States is imperiled by the con
tinued activities of Francisco Villa.
The cabinet was unanimous in de
ciding that Villa must be caught. Sen
ator Fall introduced a resolution pro
viding for the recruiting of 500,000
volunteers to police Mexico. State
department dispatches from Chihua
hua say General Gutierrez, the Car
ranza commander there, has given or-1
ders for the capture of the bandits
who raided Columbusf
Washington, March 10. After (in
early conference today between Sec
retary Baker and Major General Scott,
chief of staff, it was announced that
the Columbus massacre is a closed in
cident so far as the war department is
concerned. General Scott said that
unless it was decided to have Ameri
can troops cross the border again
there was no likelihood of further in
itiative action by the army.
Major General Funston in an over
night dispatch urgently recommended
that he be authorized to send Ameri
can troops over the border to clean out
the bandit gangs. The state depart
ment will pass on the recommenda
tion. Border Bandit Shelter.
General Funston's dispatch added
that "so long as the border is a shel
ter for the band they will continue to
harrass our ranches and towns to our
chagrin. Brigadier General Pershing
reported that the Mexican consul at

CARRANZA SILENT.
Mexico City, March 10. Gen
eral Carranza does not care to
make a statement in regard to the
situation resulting from the raid
on Columbus, N. jr. A rigid cen
sorship has been imposed. News
papers are printing nothing of the
raid and the public has not been
advised of it.

Springfield, 111., March 10. The state
board of live stock commissioners is
sued an order today requiring rail-
i roads to furnish clean and disinfected
cars for the shipment of all cattle,
sheep and swine imported into the
state for breeding, stocking or feeding

SWEDES TO REMOVE
GERMAN MINE FIELD
Stockholm, via London, March 10.
The Swedish government has decided
to remove the German mine field off
Falsterbo, which caused the loss of the
steamer Martha. The press supports
the government in this decision and
several newspapers declare that the
German object in laying of these mines
is to prevent all traffic between the
Baltic and the North sea.
THE WAR
TODAY
Washington, March 10. Rus
sian troops have landed on the
Black Sea coast of Asiatic Tur
key and the occupation of Trebi
zond is imminent, according to a
dispatch received today from the
American embassy at Constanti
nople. The state department also was
advisd that the American consul
at Trebizond had taken over the
archives of the German consulate
there, the German consul having
left.
A momentary let np in the des
perate infantry fighting about
Verdun is reported today from
Paris. The Germans have not
again attacked on either bank of
the Meuse, it is announced, but
violent bombardment of the de
fenses continued, indicating that
the respite probably is to be brief.
An official statement from Fan's
today emphatically contradicts the
German claim to the capture of
the fort and Tillage of Vanx. The
fort was not even attacked, the
war offlc asserts and while Ger
man infantry did succeed in en
tering Vaux, they were subse
(luently driven out, the tillage re
maining in French hands.
I'aris declares the greater part
of Corbeaux wood, where des
perat fighting has been taking
place, remains for the greater
part in French hands. There are
signs of renewed activity on the
eastern front as the spring ap
proaches. The most Important move on
the northern end of the line,
seems to have been a German ef
fort to cross the Pvina river
above Dvinsk. The considerable
force engaged in this effort was
dispersed by the Russian tire, I'e
trograd claims.
On the eastern front, the Rus
sians have taken the offensive at
various points but Berlin declares
the attacks have not been success
ful anywhere.
On the Black sea coast the Rus
sians continue to push forward
toward Turkey's principal port,
Trebizond and also are making
progress against Ottoman posi

R ALIVE
TROOPS READY TO
RUSH INTO FIGHT
Twelve Thousand Soldiers, Mountain
Batteries and Field Guns Sta
tioned in Texas).
Washington, March 10. Approxi
mately 12,000 troops, with 48 mountain
batteries and field guns, are on the
border between Douglas, Ariz., and El
Paso, Texas. A little more than one
third of the force is cavalry and all
could be assembled at any point be
tween the two towns within two days.
The cavalry and a battalion of moun
tain artillery, with 12 mountain guns
especially designed for the character
of fighting which the punitive expedi
tion will wage, could be assembled
within 24 hours.
The 13th, 7th, 8th and 10th cavalry
are scattered along the border be
tween Douglas and El Paso. The 11th,
18th and 22nd infantry, the 6th field
artillery and a battalion of the 4th
mountain artillery are at Douglas. At
El Paso, about sixty miles from Co
lumbus, are four regiments of infan
try, the 6th, 7th, 16th and 20th. The
12th infantry is at Nogales, btween
Columbus and Douglas.
The mountain guns with which the
mountain artillery is equipped are
carried on mules and accompanied by
an ammunition train which would en
able it to cooperate with the cavalry
in the hills.
MAKESDEATHVOW
TO ALL AM ERIC ANS
Villa's Edict is Told in Letter Written
by Him and Found After Raid
On New Mexico.
Columbus, N. M., March 10. An
invitation to General Emiliano Zapata
to march north and join in an attack
on the United States was sent by
Francisco Villa in January, according
to a copy of a letter found among Vil
la's captured papers. The letter was
dated San Geronimo, Chihuahua, Jan.
6, 1916.
"I shall not expend another shell
on brother Mexicans," Villa wrote in
the letter, "but will prepare and or
ganize to attack the Americans on
their own soil and let them know that
Mexico is a land of the free and the
tomb of traitors."
Villa proposed that the joint move
ment with Zapata against the Uni
ted States should occur six months
from Jan. 6. Zapata so far as known
made no move to accept and this may
have been responsible for Villa's de
cision to march on Columbus at once.
Villa, in the letter attributed his
defeat at Agua Prieta last November
to the action o the United States
government in permitting Carranza
military authorities to send over
American territory reinforcements for
the Mexican town opposite Douglas,
Ariz., and declared that act an invas
ion of the sovereignty of Mexico and
an insult to the people.
"At that time," Villa told Zapata,
"I restrained, but with the greatest
difficulty, the impulse of my troops to
attack the city of Douglas."
Carranza, he also stated in the let
ter, had sold Mexico to the United
States agreeing to lease Magdalena
bay for 99 years and giving over con
trol of the Mexican national railroad.
GERMANS AND RUSS
CHANGE PRISONERS
Stockholm, March 10. It is an
nounced that the exchange of incapac

ed that three or four trains of pris
oners will be exchanged each week.

Columbus, X. M., March 10. Fed

OPPOSES PLAN TO
RAISE MORE MEN
Lord Shaughnessy Takes Stand
Against Increasing Canada's Con
tingent in European War.
Montreal, March 10. Lord Shaugh-
nessy, president of the Canadian Pa
cific Railway company, Is opposed to
the plan of Sir Robert Borden, the
Canadian premier, to raise the Cana
dian contingent in the European, war
to 500,000. Addressing a meeting ot
business and military leaders held
here yesterday to encourage recruit
ing) Lord Shaughnessy said he did not
regard the plan as practicable and that
if Canada was to attempt to raise 225,
000 men in addition to its present
army, it would cause a serious draft
upon the working population. He an
nounced that the agricultural depart
ment has asked the Canadian Pacific
for aid in taking 10,000 farmers to the
western provinces for seeding and
harvesting work.
Lord Shaughnessy advised that Can-.
ada go slow about recruiting, saying
that
some of the first Canadian con
tingent are still in camp in England,
while 130,000 men representing an out
lay of probably $12,000,000 a month are
still in Canada with no prospect of be-
1 ing moved to Europe for a long time.
He said it would have been better to
have gone more slowly and saved
$5,000,000 a month, for use hereafter.
He asked if it would be wise to go on
lessening Canada's ability to give
financial aid to the British empire
when the time of its need should come.
Major General Sir Sam Hughes said
that no industry would be threatened
in shortage of labor if one million men
went to the front, adding that Mont
real could recruit 50,000 to 70,000 men,
Lord Shaughnessy replied if go the
women would have to enlist.
The meeting adopted a resolution
approving the effects to recruit men in
Montreal and calling upon employers
to encourage their employes to enlist.
A resolution offered by Leo Doyan, a
French-Canadian, that no action be
taken to accelerate Canada's share in.
the war, was lost in a storm of hisses.

FRENCH DENY REPORT
Capture of Vaux as Claimed
by Germans Is Termed
Utterly False.
j Berlin, (via London, March 10, 4:20
p. m.) Capture of the Ablain wood
was announced today by German ar
my headquarters. It was stated that
the French had regained a foothold in.
the fort of Vaux.
The. statement says that on the
eastern bank of the Meuse the Ger
mans took six officers, 681 men and
11 cannon; that Ablain wood and the
ridge west of Douaumont were taken
from the enemy after stubborn fight
ing and that in the Woevre plain the
Germans pushed forward through the
wooded sector southeast of Damloup.
The statement says German avia
tors shot down two British aero
planes. The pilot of the first aeroplane
was killed.
In the eastern and Balkan fronts
the statement says there is nothing to
report
Paris, March 10 (2:35 p. m.) The
text of the announcement given out by
the French war office this afternoon
reads: a,-"1 J"
"In the Argonne district our artil
lery bombarded certain convoys or
the enemy moving along the road from
Montfaucon to Avocourt
"There has been no change in tha
situation west or east of the river
Meuse. The night passed without the
enemy making any infantry attack
against our positions. The bombard
ment, however, has continued, both
sides taking part along our front. It
has been violent on the left and right
banks of the river Meuse and inter-
mittent in the Woevre district
"In Alsace our batteries have de
molished the German trenches at hill
No. 425, which is east of Thann.
"The night passed quietly on the
i remainder of the front.
"During the day of March 8 French
aviators showed themselves particu
larly active. French airmen delivered
a number of attacks, most of them
over the lines of the enemy. During
one of these engagements at Erienes
15 German airmen were forced to flee.
Later 10 of them were seen to be de
scending vertically in the direction of
their own lines.
"Information has been received that
two German aviators, one in a Fokker
machine, have been overcome in the
Champagne district and three others
vanquished in the region of Verdun.
The machines of these five aviators
came to the ground within German
lines."
Deny German Report.
An official note has been issued cat
egorically denying the statement made
in the German official communication
of March 9 ttyat "the village and arm
ored fort of Vaux were captured in a
glorious night attack by Posen reserve
regiments under the leadership ot
General von Guretsky Cornitz." This
assertion, the note says, is in every
way false.-
The note denies other statements
contained in recent German official
communications.
The French official note says:
"German official dispatches of March
9 affirm that in a glorious night attack
the Posen reserve regiments Nos. 6
and 19, under command of the infantry
general. Von Guretsky Cornitz, storm
ed the fort of Vaux with a number of
adjacent fortifications. This asser
tion is false in every way. At the very
hour when the German communication
arrived, the French staff found that
the fort of Vaux had not been attack
ed and that the soldiers guarding it
were calmly at their posts.
"The same communication asserts
further (1), that German troops are
engaged in clearing French troops
still remaining out of Corbeaux wood;
(2), that the Germans stormed the vil
lage of Vaux. These assertions are
both untrue. At the present moment
the enemy only occupies the eastern
extremity of Corbeaux wood, the great
er part of which is held by us. All
German counter attacks failed to drive
us from it. The village of Vaux, at
tacked during the night by German
troops, was vigorously defended and
remains in our hands. The German
