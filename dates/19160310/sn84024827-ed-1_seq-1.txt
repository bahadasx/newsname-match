Columbus, N. M., Scene of Early
Morning Attack; 17 Americans

Led by the Infamous "Lion of the North Fifteen Hundred Mexicans Invade Border
Town, Killing Many Inhabitants, Sacking the Stores and Houses and Burning Prop-

Hours Necessary to Drive Mexicans Out of U. S. Troops
COLUMBUS, N. M.. March 9
Francisco Villa with 1500 men,
raided the United States territory
today. They attacked Columbus
and killed at least sixteen Ameri
cans and fired many buildings be
fore being driven bark a cross the
border. At least 250 United States
Uniied States cavalrymen follow
ed the Villa band into Mexico.
Reports from Colonel Slocum
late today stated that Villa had
made a stand fifteen miles south
of the border where spirted fight
ing ensued.
An unarmed private was killed
and a captain was wounded. A
snail detachment of troops under
Majors Tompkins and Lindsley,
fighting dismounted, made a deter
mined stand against renewed Villa
attneks. At last reports they
were holding their ground.
The raid on American territory
proved costly to Villa. Eighteen
Mexican bandits, including Pablo
Lopez, second in command, were
were gathered and burned before
noon. The troopers reported an
' undetermined number of dead
were still lying in the brush. They
were led to the attack under the
slogan of "death to Americans."
The bandits fought with despera
tion. Jtist before dnwn they . crept
r'tVs fitches, skirting the
United Staes cavalry camp and
rushed th sleeping town, firing
heavily. The first volley brought
1)e American trooners into almost
instant action. While a portion of
the raiders engaged the cavalry,
others applied the torch, shooting
American civilians venturing from
the buinldings.
Many civilians barricaded them
selves in their homes and fired at
the Mexicans as they darted
' through the streets. The fighting
ended as suddenly as it began.
Two hours after the first shot Vil
la buglars sounded retreat. The
raiders fled in disorder, American
troopers closely following.
LIGHTS ARE TARGETS
The lights in homes and public
ruildings became the targets of
Villa snipers. Other bandits,
creeping close to the American
ho 'es, enticed a number of civil
ians into the open with English
spoken invitations. A number of
fatalities are attributed to this
ruse. Stores were looted and oil
poured on frame structures while
the matches were applied by still
other bandits. The postoffice was
raided and the furniture smashed.
The looters only secured one reg.
istered package.
UNDER GUARD
COLUMBUS. March 9. The women
and children remaining here are quar
tered in the school house and the ar
my camps under guard.
AMERICAN WOMAN RELEASED
Mrs. Maud Wright, an Ame
rican, who said she was held cap
tive by Villa for nine days and
released in the midst of the fight
ing, said that on March 1 Villa
announced his intention of attack
ing Columbus. He "proceeded
north under forced marches. His
men. with scanty supplies of
water and meat, suffered severely.
Villa ruled by fear. His officer
beat the men into line with their
swords.
She said her husband, Edward.
formerly of Houston, and Frnrk
Hayden, a youth employed a
the
Las Bocas sawmill, were
taken
from the Wright Ranch March 1
and presumably killed. When
forced to ride she said a bandit
ordered her to give her baby to
a Mexican family.
Mrs. Wright is cared for at
the home of General Slocum. Up
to yesterday she said Villa wore
civilian clothes, a queer llttl-s
straw hat, rode a mule, and just
before the fight appeared cl i l in
a uniform, on a handsome sorrel
charger. She said Villa led nenrly
1500 men upon the sleeping Amer
ican town. Guards told her Vil'
had 3000 men and 6000 horses.

DESCRIPTION OF ATTACK.
There are about 500 Americans
iu Columbus and nearly as many
Mexicans, many of whom are re
fugees, having fled in advance of
Villa. I.ibrado Marquez was plac
ed under military guard charged
with having directed the opera
tions of the bandits and also of
giving information to Villa
through spies.
Lieut. Castelman, the oliicer of
the day, was aroused by Grinfljn'f
shot. He was met at the door
by a Mexican who fired at him
pointblank. but missed. Castle-
man killed him and marched his
troop to the town to protect the
civilian men, women and chil
dren running the streets under
fire of the Mexicans in the glare
of the flames from the hotel and
other buildings. .
Castleman placed his men in
front of the hotel, next door to the
bank, and engaged the Mexicans,
who. though greatly outnumbering
his force, were driven westward.
Lucas placed his men on the rail
road track, supported by two ma
chine guns and took the retreat
ing Mexicans on the flank as they
Jled, practically all mounted,,
southward.
Colonel Slocum Ml his quart
ers within ten mintes after the
first shot and reached the Hooer
hotel as the Mexicans approach
ed. A bullet knocked a revolver
from his hand. As the Villa
forces retreated they stopped at
the ranch of J. J. Moore, killed
him, wounded his wife, and loot
ed the place. Moore was taken
from his house and shot on the
doorstep! Mrs. Moore was brought
here, painfully, thought not seri
ously wounded .in the thigh.

that five American cavalry troops
with headquarters here were scat
tered for miles along the border.
Assured by the spies of certain
aid to be given by the Mexican
residents. Villa started hii ad
vance. The first intimation of

Griffin, the sentry, who gave his
life to give the alarm by firing on
the bandits.
BODIES BURNED.
Twenty seven bodies of Mexi
cans were burned. The wounded
weer treated in the hospital of the
Thirteenth Cavalry. Army surge
one were assisted by women nus
es. Some of the Villa wounded
are mere boys. Army otlicers
bore testimony that residents

sule Colonel Slocum ordered the
troops to search the Mexican
houses and deprive everyone of
arms on the pain, of death for
refusal to given them up.

Hopes Carranza Won't Ob

Troops; Official Circles Fail
to Disguise Satisfaction.
FORMAL INVASION ,

Patrols Prohibited from Cross
ing Border Under Any Cir
cumstances; Border Well
Martialed by Troops.
WASHINGTON. March 9. Washing
ton stands squarely behind Colonel
Slocum in sending his cavalrymen in
to Mexico in pursuit of the Villa out
laws who raided Columbus. Secretary
Lansing informed the de facto govern
ment through Ambassador Designate:
Arredondo. that he trusted no object
ion would be made to the action of ttui
American troops. No orders were is
sued for return of the soldiers and
probably none will be issued for tbe
present.
Shocked indignation at news of the
outrage succeeded undismissed satis
faction in official and congressional
"irclos that, after three years of pa-
Ment forbearance. I nited States
'roops actually were on Mexican soil
to avenge the death of their comrades
nd bring to justice the outlaws
whose depredations have terrorized
Americans on both sides of the bor
ler. Reports of the American troops'
action tonight, probably fifteen miles
outh of the border against a- much
larger force of bandits were heard
with anxious interest in official cir
cles.
It is not considered in administra
tion circles that the pursuit in any
sense constituted an invasion of Mex
ico which policy the administration
has opposed and will continue to op
pose. There is normally no authority
for the presence of American troops
in Mexico. Patrols are under orders
not to cross in any consideration. If
provocation is not so great officers re
sponsible will face a courtmartial.
Suggestions that Colonel Slocum face
a courtmartial were scouted by som
officials but at the War Department
they were not discussed.
More than 4.000 cavalry and a bat
talion of the Fourth Mountain Artill
ery with twelve guns are in the terri-
ory between Douglas and El Paso.
They can be assembled at any point
within twenty-four hours. In the same
territory are eight regiments of infan
try, the Sixth Field Artillery and a
battalion of the Fourth Artillery, mak-
ng an additional force of approxi
mately SOOO infantry and thirey-six
field and mountain guns which could
"e gatherer at Columbus in two days.
Administration leaders fear the out
break of critics of the President's Mex-
can policy in Congress tomorrow.
Senator Fall of New Mexico, long an
rdent supporter of intervention, an
nounced his purpose of introducing a
resolution to provide for the recruit
;ng of 500.000 volunteers to intervene
;n Mexico at the earliest moment. It
is known other senators, including
fiallinger. have in contemplation reso
lutions in respect to aggressive action
'oward Mexico.
