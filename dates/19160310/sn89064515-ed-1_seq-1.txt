never have been saved.

upstairs. All the household ~oods' be

DIED
Solomon H. Dingman, a former resi
dent of Little Falls, passed away a
St. Cloud Friday, after an illness of
several years' duration. For the past
ten months he was confined to his bed
He was 80 years of age.
Mr. Dingman was born near Coberg,
Canada, November 26, 1836. At the
age of nine years he came to the Unit
ed States with his parents, locating at
Chicago, where he grew to manhood.
When the Civil war broke o?t he en
listed with Company E, First Wiscon
sin Heavy artillery, with which he
served until honorably discharged on
June 25, 1865.- For more than forty
years previous to moving to St. Cloud
he lived in or near Little Falls and is
known to many people in this vicinity.
A wife and two sons and two daugh
ters survive him. The sons are George
and Charles Dingman of Chehalis,
Wash., and the daughters are ,J^rs,
tJkrl Trfibastt «n:4 M*sV
St. Cloud. It was at the home of the
latter that he died.
The remains were brought to this
city Monday noon and the funeral was
held from the M. E. church at 2 o'clock
p. m., Rev. John Watson officiating.
Interment was in Oakland, cemetery,
Stephen porash of Royalton passed
away Wednesday evening at St. Ga
briel's nospital from old age. He was

fined to the hospital for the past eight
months. Two sons and two daughters
survive him. The funeral arrange
ments have not been made.
CLOCK WILL BE PURCHASED
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS WILL
RECEIVE BIDS AT NEXT
MEETING
The purchase of a clock for the
court house tower with the money be
queathed the county for that purpose
by the late Josiah Page, will be con
sidered at the next meeting of the
county commissioners, on April 4, and
probably within a few weeks from that
time the grand memorial to the de
ceased citizen will occupy its place in
the court house tower, announcing the
time of the day by means of its dials
and chimes.
At the meeting of the board Tues
day representatives of two clock man
ufacturing companies, the E. Howard
Clock company and the Seth Thompson
company, were present and" showed the
commissioners plans of various kinds
of clocks and prices. All the plans
were for clocks with four dials, for
the four sides of the tower, and
equipped with apparatus to illuminate
the dials with electricity at night.
Either the tube or bell chimes can be
had, but the latter is said to produce
a much louder tone and will likely be
selected. The clocks can be made to
strike every hour, half and quarter.
The two representatives differed
somewhat as to the size of the dials
and the way the clock should be put
in the tower. One of the men stated
that the clock should be placed just
below the gable roof of the tower, us
ing 6% foot dials,, but the other sales
man claimed that th'e trees which
surround the court house block would
obscure the view to the clock to one
in close proximity and he stated that
dormers should be built on the roof
of the tower and 6 foot dials used, as
by so doing the clock would be up much
higher and the view to it unobstruc
ed.
It is possible that the county may
have to put in a sum in addition to
the amount of the bequest on account
of the changes to be made in the tow
er, and the commissioners generally are
in favor of so doing, up to a reasonable
amount. Specifications and bids will
be received by the board at its next
meeting.
A memorial tablet to the late Mr.
Page will be purchased and will proba
bly be placed inside the court house.
It could not very well be placed on
the tower near the clock as the letters
would have to be extremely large to
be discernable.

HIGH TO BRAINERD AND AITKIN
DEFEAT OF BRAINERD WILL
MEAN THREE-CORNERED
FIGHT FOR DIST. TITLE
In order that they may have the
week of March 18 open to play off a
possible tie in the district champion
ship race the local high school quint
will play two games this week.. They
play Brainerd high at that place to
night and the Aitkin high tomorrow
night.
The locals lost to Brainerd in the
first game of the season but hope to
revenge the order of things this time
and will play their very best. They
defeated Aitkin earlier in the season
and, while the result of this game will
not affect the championship, the locals
are desirous of winning it and will
put forth their best efforts.
Should the locals win froin Brain
erd, which they hope to do,, there will
be a three-cornered fight on for the
district championiship, between Be
midji, Brainerd and Little Falls. The
final games would have to be played
on neutral floors and would" be very
interesting. *r\
CHEMICAL ENGINE SOLD—FUNDS
APPROPRIATED FOR POOR—
BILLS ALLOWED
The city council held a regular
monthly meeting at the city hall Mon
day evening, Aldermen Hall, Moeglein,
Blake, Murphy and Peterson being
present.
The chemical engine at the city hall
was sold to the village of Genola for
$225.
N. N. Bergheim and Mrs. F. G. Ruth
appeared on behalf of the Civic league
and asked the council to pay one-half
of. the bill for the care of Mrs. Chas.
Beauchaine. They stated that at the
time she was taken to the hospital for
treatment it was not thought she
would be there very lone, but her
condition was such th^t she had to be
be kept there tor five weeks. The to
tal amount of the bill was $46.50 and
the league agreed to pay one-half if
the council would pay the other half.
They also told the council of a needy
Polish family of the en,/ which one
of the Hawthorne teachers had called
the attention of Miss Lally, the visit
ing nurse, to. In this home the hus
band is an invalid and has been ill for
over three years. Three children whtf
have been attending school, had no
clothing when the league representa
tives visited the home, being clad
merely with flour sacks, not even hav
ing shoes or stockings. The league
purchased $17 worth of clothing for.
the family and the visiting nurse did
considerable free work there. The
father stated that he could feed the
children but said that he was unable
to clothe them. The council agreed
to pay one-half of both bills, and ap
propriated $31.75 for this purpose.
The bill of the Pine Tree Manufac
turing company for $854.07 for repair

third, from the county. The total cost
of repairing the bridge was $1,272.11.
This includes $50 for the repairing of
the east approach of the bridge which

nary primary and: general elections*
The polls will be open at the usual
places, and at the usual times, that is,
in the rural towns and villages the
polls will open at 9 a. m., and in cities
at 6 a. m., and the time for voting for
presidential candidates and delegates
will end in towns, villages and cities
at the same time—9 p. m.
So, if you desire to vote for presi
dential candidates and for delegates
to the national conventions you may
have that privilege by asking for your
party ballot at your usual voting pre
cinct.
If you vote for candidates for dele
gates to the democratic national con
vention, be careful to study your, bal
lot before you mark it. There.is only
one question to decide in th^, demo
cratic primary—whether Lynch or an
ti-Lvnch delegates are selected. The
names of those opposed to Lynch are:
At large (vote for four) Austin, King,
Beiter and Wessel. From this district
(vote for two)—Baer and Donohue.
Over the lists of delegates at large
are the words "vote for four only."
Pick four names from the eight and
vote for no more than four, or your
ballot will be void.
The same advice will apply as to dis
trict delegates, except that under this
head you may vote for two, and no
more. In this district (the 6«th),
more than two candidates have, filed.
Be careful to vote for only four dele
gates at large and for only two dis
trict delegates.
Be sure to study your ballot care
fully before you vote. It is simple,
when you give it a thought.
Take no chances. I
Think before you mark your ballot.

St. Paul Dispatch: County officials

out and'hustle for ft* re-election this
year.
There are some politicians about the
state, including defeated candidates
for one and another of these county
offices, who are not satisfied with the
result of the 1914 elections, and they
are now recalling the decision of the
supreme court last December in .the
litigation over the municipal judgesnip
at Duluth.
Exceeds Constitutional Limit
In giving his opinion in this case,
Judge Hallam turned aside to remark
that "as a matter of fact county of
ficers in every county of the state to
day are holding under a statute fixing
their term' at four years from the first
Monday in January, 1915, and until
their successors are elected and quali
fied. This term exceeds the constitu
tional limit fixed by section 9, article
7 of the constitution, which permits
no hold-over at all. But it has never
been considered that such statutes are
void except as to the excess over the
constitutional limit."
Some Doubt Exemption
There are those who doubt that the
omission of the words "county offic
ers" from the last clause exempts
them from the provision regarding the
biennial election, since they are men
tioned in the first clause. And the last
sentence o'f the section says that "all
state, county and other officers elect
ed at the general election whose terms
would otherwise expire on the first
Monday in January, 1886, shall hold
and continue in such offices until the
first Monday in January, 1887."
Should some voter, ambitious to hold
a county office offer his filing to tne.
county auditor, it would probably be
refused. Then he could apply to the
supreme court for a writ of mandam
us.
Would Mean Lively Scramble
The question is whether the other
justices would hold with Justice Hal
lam, and declare section 10 of the gen
eral laws of 1913, which extended the
terms of county officers to four years
unconstitutional.
If they should, there would be one
lively scramble for county offices. The
legislature of 1915 took the safe road
with regard to judges of probate and
passed an act for the submission to
the people of a constitutional amend
ment extending their terms to four
years. The amendment will be voted
upon at the November election^ |?.
