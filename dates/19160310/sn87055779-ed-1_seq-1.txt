Internntlonal News Servier:
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.. March 10.
When the otflcial count is in the re
turns will show Harry New lead
ing James F. Watson for the nomi
nation for United States senator on
the republican ticket by a plurality
of 7,000 votes. He has approximate
ly that number of votes more than
Watson in the unofficial vote today.
It is not thought that there can bo
a majority so the second choice
votes must be gone over too.
In the preference vote for presi
dent, 86 out of 92 counties give
Charles Warren Fairbanks, repub
lican. 169,12 3. and Woodrow Wilson,
democrat, 150,493. It was also
thought that Fairbanks, would run
50,000 ahead of Wilson, because of
the great republican vote.
If the second choice votes fall to
give New a majority the nomination
will go to the state convention.
New's managers this morning said
he had a plurality of 7.0S6 on first
choice votes. No effort has been
made to line up the second choice
votes.

New Mexico.
AMERICAN TROOPS ARE
SHIFTED ALONG BORDER
Pancho's Army is Divided Into
Roving Bands Menacing
Whole Border Line of
United States.
International News Service
COLUMBUS, N. M.. March 10.
While American troops were being
shifted along the border today to
prevent further raids by Francisco
Villa and his troops, reports reach
ed here that a large lody of Mex
icans were marching upon Hachita,
N. M., with the intention of sacking
that town and killing more United
States citizens.
A picket on duty at Hachita sent
warning to the military authorities
that the Mexicans were only two
miles from the town, which Is eight
miles "north of the borderland 42
miles west of Columbus. A tele
phone message from Hachita said
that the Mexicans would meet a
surprise if they made an attack, as
the first battalion of the 11th United
Slate infantry had arrived there to
reinforce the small detachment of
the 13th cavalry formerly the sole
protectors of that district.
The Infantry, under command of
MaJ. John C. Bennett, is well equip
ped with machine gun batteries.
Ilail Service Susjcndctl.
Railroad service along the border
has been suspended owing to the at
tack on Columbus, which resulted in
the killing of 17 Americans, includ
ing soldiers and civilians. Trains
eastbound from Hachita and west
bound from Columbus were held up
at those two points in fear that the
Villistas would wreck them and kill
the passengers.
The pursuit of the Mexican raid
ers who spread death and destruc
tion in Columbus was ended today.
! The American troopers w ho drove
' out Villa and his outlaws chased
them five miles into Mexico, but had
to turn back when they found them
selves outnumbered. Word has been
passed along the border, however,
that the American government is
going to take up the pursuit of Villa
and his murderers as soon as sullic
ient troops can be moved here.
Villa is reported to have been
wounded In the raid which he led
yesterday, but his body was not
found among the corpses of Mexicans
found in the town or across the bor
der. According to one prisoner w ho
was taken, Villa was assisted to his
horse by two of his body guard and
fled at the head of his men when
they retreated.
Expect Another Attack.
None of the American military of
ficers here doubt that Villa will make
other attacks along the border. Hej
is short of supplies and those which
he had expected to get in Columbus
were abandoned in great part in the
hurried Hicht from Oo'.umbus when
his raiders were driven out by the
American troopers.
After a tense but quiet night Co
lumbus awoke today and took up
the sad task of burying and ship
ping away the bodies of the Amer
icans killed in Thursday's attack.
The hysteria caused by the massacre
had subsided and the residents had
settled down to the grim task of re
moving evidences of the tragedy that
had turned the quiet little twn into
the abode of death.
Americans who had met Villa re
iterated their declaration that the
rebel leader directed the Columbus
attack in person. Their statements
were corroborated by C'apt. Faviauo
Garcia, a member of the Mexican
party, captured bv the United States
troops. He said that Villa remained
in a protected spot on the outskirts
of Columbus during the I'htins and
directed his detachments by bucrle
calls and messages transmitted by
mounted orderlies.
Mrs. Mautl Wrinht. ho had been
taken prisoner bv the Mexicans
south of the border after her hus-j
band had ln murdered and was
released yesterday, asserts that Villa

Fourteen -Year -Old Boy
Among Heroes of Attack
On Columbia by Bandits
InternatU-nal News Service:
COLUMBUS, N. M.. March 10.
One of the heroes of the Mexican
attack upon Columbus is a 14-year-old
American boy. He is Arthur
Ravel, who was captured by Villa's
men, but later escaped.
"They came into the house aid
pulled ne out of bed," said young
Ravel today in telling of his exper
ience. "I had only a shirt on. but
they gave me time to put on my
trousers. There were several Mex
icans on each side of the bed and
all had pistols or rifles. One of
them held a pistol against my head
and told me that if I didn't tell
them where every American In the
town lived, he would kill me.
" 'We are going to kill them all
said the Mexican. I could hear rifle
shots and when we got out into the
streets the bullets were flying in
every direction, and I could see the
fire coming from the rifle barrels in
the darkness.
Roy Tricks Bandits.
"One of the men asked me if I
had any brothers and I said that I
had one. Then the leader of the
gang told me to take them to the
place where my brother was. but I
knew they wanted to kill him and
decided to trick them. My brother
at the time was sleeping in our store,
but instead of taking the men there
I led them to another part of town.

30 or 40 Mexicans in the gang.

MAYOR TO DISCOSS
Keller Agrees to Meet Com
mittee of Representative
Citizens Monday.
Mayor Fred W. Keller has con
sented to meet a delegation of 8 4
business men and responsible cit
izens next Monday afternoon at 2
o'clock to discuss the school situa
tion which has developed since the
school controversy several weeks
ago which arose through the dis
missal of Supt. L.. J. Montgomery
and the subequent resignation of
Arthur L. Hubbard from the board.
A communication signed by 8 4 men
was sentf to the mayor Friday morn
ing asking for a hearing and re
questing that the mayor set a date
for the meeting. He immediately
stated that the meeting would take
place Monday afternoon at 2 o'clock.
The communication which result
ed in Mayor Keller's agreeing to
meet wi'.h citizens to discuss the
school situation follows:
The following letter was address
ed to the- mayor by the committee:
Your Honor:
We believe that our schools are
the most important of our municipal
institutions. The reasons for this
belief are so many and so obvious
that it is not necessary to set them
forth. We are deeply interested in
their management. Of recent years
and even to the present day the di
rection of school aaffirs in South
Bend hau not been satisfactory. To
trace the causes can serve only one
purpose, namely, to provide, if pos
sible, against repetition. To this
end we Jisk your cooperation. As
taxpayer?, as parents, as citizens sin
cerely interested, we wish to meet
with you In conference to discuss the
future of our schools.
Only good can result from an ex
change of ideas by men who aro
honestly and intelligently devoted to
the welfare of our public school?.
We earnestly petition you to inform
the chairman of this committee of
the time and place at which you will
receive u?. .
Respectfully,

stopped and was joined bj- about 5 0
more Mexicans who were yelling
and shooting like maniacs. Ten or
15 cf them ran into the hotel and
dragged out three or four Amer
icans, among them a woman. Two
Mexicans turned loose with the
rifles and the men fell. One of the
others pointed his gun at the woman
and I guess he would 'Jiave killed
her, but she shouted, 'Viva Mexico,'
and he put down his gun. If she
had not been cool enough to think
of that they would have killed her
all right.
"Then the two men who were
leading me by the arms, started
with me back to our store. By thi
time the shooting was worse than
ever. Most of the men had bayonets
on their guns and I reckon they
were the same weapons they had
used when they were soldiers.
"Just before we reached the store
the greaser who had hold of my
right arm, suddenly gave a scream
and doubled up on the street. He
had been hit by a bullet. The other
Mexican got so excited he let go of
me and he had no sooner clone so
than he was wounded, too.
"I started to run toward the
house, but stopped at the home of
Miss Burton, my school teacher,
and told her she had better get out
as quick as she could for the Mex
icans were killing everybody in
town. She was pretty badly scared,
but she did not lose any time in
getting away. She went outside of
the town and hid in the brush until
daylight."

that he must b removed ;is
menace to the peace of th.e country.
The following statement was is

Tumulty:
"An adequate force will lie
sent at once in pursuit of Villa
with the single object of cap
turing him and putting a stop
