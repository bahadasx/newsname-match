ADMIT GERMANS
HAVE MADE GAINS
CLAIM THESE HAVE BEEN MADE
WITH HEAVY LOSSES
REPORTS OF A SEA FIGHT
ROME REPORT TELLS THAT GERMAN
BOATS HAVE COME INTO NORTH
SEA FROM THEIR BASE
Paris, March 10.—Driving bard
against the Frenoh line northwest and
southeast of Verdan, the Germans
have made additional gains bat with
heavy casualties aooording to a report
from Paris.
Hill No. 265 to the southeast and a
portion of Corbeau Wood south of the
forces have been ocoupied. The town
of Fresnes in the Woerve district was
also captured. The occupation of a
portion of (Jorbeaux Wood indicates
that the Germans have advanced over
three miles since they captured the
foroes. The Germans penetrated a re
doubt in the region of Douaumont but
were immediately forced out.
The recapture by the Germans of
positions from the Frenoh in the Ar
gonne forest ar.d the expulsion of
small British detachments from the
oaptured German trenches rortheast
of Vermelles are related in the latest
German report.
Despite the report from Rome that
twenty German dreadnaughts hud
come into the North Sea from their
base at Kiel and the other reports that
seem to pressage the imminence of a
naval battle, uothing definite has come
through to show that the German war
ships are maneuvering or seeking a
battle. *.
RIVALS SPEARFISH CANYON.
Edgemont Express Editor Gives Views
Hot Brook Canyon Near Here.
The following is dipped from the
Judgement Express regarding the Hot
Brook Oanyon and a few very pertin
ent suggestions are made by Mr.
Goddard that would be well to have
followed oat by the people of this
city:
"The auto tourist is the one that the
Black Hills people are making great
efforts to bring here and to that end
Dead wood and Lawrenoe county have
spent hundreds, yes, thousands of dol
lars to make SpearflBh Canyon a point
of interest.
Coming from the Springs Monday
night and seeing the beautiful oanyon
through which the train passed it
seemed as though the people did not
want people to see this. The road goes
part of the way to the oanyon and then
up to the hills, to the woods, leaving
the oanyon for the people who travel
on the train to admire. It is safe to
•ay that not one oat of a handred
people who went from oat of the state
to Hot Springs knew there was a oan
yon there, not oue that knew how
beaatifal it was.
0f
J|
i|
There is a road as far as Erskine so
we understand. If this was fixed what
a drive the Hot Springs people oould
give their tourists.
Rapid oanyon is being filled with
oamping homes—Fall River oould be
the same.
It is something that the Commercial
club at Hot Springs oould take up and
it seems to us that if i« both possible
and feasible to have a r:ad from Hot
Springs to MinnekaiktH ibrough the
canyon,"
PRESENT STATUS OF PRIMARY LAW
Decision of U. S. Supreme Court on the
Richards Primary
Pierre, S. D., March 10.—The attor.
ney general received a telegram from
Washington announcing that the
United States supreme oourt had
granted the motion to dismiss the
"Richards Primary Oaoe," wMob intact
that the law enacted by the le?4, legis
lature and amended by the special
session will be the one which will be
used at the primary of this year.
Mr. Rlohards, while in thi9 oity a
afeW days ago,
Bald tiat
""NT1. VimB-
on
such aotion on
Hthe part of the United States oourt
iwhile not anticipated by him, would
mean that the filings of the list of can
didates selected and filed as the aotion
the "minority proposal oommittee"
'V would be made under the law and that
be would make his oamtaign to a large
—extent upon the re-ins^atement of the
new primary aot whioh he plaoed be
fore the people through the initiative
last
year, whioh is an amendment to
the original aot which was plaoed upon
the statute through the action of the
people and repealed by the action of
the last legislature. He 6aid that while
most of the selections presented to the
secretary of state by him the first of
the month, would go through the cam
paign for primary nominations, it was
possible that some of these men would
not care to go to the time, trouble and
expense of 6uoh a campaign. Bat
that most of them would be on the list
of candidates filed, under the individ
ual candidate provisions of the pres
ent law.
This action on the part of the su
preme oourt of the United States
leaves the manner of making nomina
tions clear unless some one should yet
attempt to refer the action of the spe
cial session, and in such case the whole
detail of the selection of primary can
didates would be under the provision
of the aot of 1915, and the selection of
delegates to the national republican
convention would need be under the
Burke plan" as there woald be no
other plan open save that of a special
election in April, the provisions of the
law being very vagae t»nd indefinite
for such an election,- and 6uoh that
there would have to be considerable
straining of language to mak9 the dif
ferent parts of the law in the case.
Beginning last Tuesday, March 7,
names can be legally secured on peti
tions for nominations of candidates
for state offioers, for either a May or
June primary, and from this time on
the petitions of the various candidates
will be circulated for filing in time for
either date and it will not be many
days until the petitions are showing up
in the office of the secretary of state.

gens to beoome a candidate for mayor
and by Wednesday with but three ex
ceptions every business man who was
visited had stflixed his signature to
the petition.
With an endorsement of this kind it
is safe to say that the doctor oan not
fail to beoome a candidate and it is
equally safe to say that he will have
no opposition for the honor.
Dr. Hargens has held this position
on a previous oooasion and not mean
ing to disparage any of the subsequent
holders of the office it is the oonoensus
of opinion that he was one of the best
men In the office Hot Springs has ever
had.
Following is the head of the petition
as oiroulated and the names of the
signers*

ed the woman's left obeek took a down
ward oourse and passed thru the roots
of the tongue and oame out near the
spine in the baok of the neok.
The story of the shooting which

effect that the Degnan woman had had
some trouble with Swingle the night

threatened her life. Jealousy seemed
have been the cause. Saturday

and a grip.
O'Neill requested Riober to go with
her to her room and oarry her grip

there Swingle oame Into the room
with a thirty-eight revolver in hie
hand, He made threats then and Ben
ihlnking be was bluffing endeavored
to argue with blm, The Degnan wo
man was In the room adjoining and
bearing. Swingle talking attempted to
leave the room she was In by a door
leading to the hallway, Hearing ber,
Swingle followed and oame op with ber
In the hallway. She attempted to
dodge behind Joe Waugbop, who was!
standing in the doorway but Swingle
fired over his shoulder with the above
result.
The woman staggered into the room
and when Swingle started to follow
Waughop stopped blm and would not
let blm enter deaplte threats that he
would be shot also. Finding that be
oould not get into the room he re
turned to hie own room.
Upon hearing theehot Rioher rnshed
down stairs and with O'Neill started
up town to seoure offioers. They met
Chief of Polloe George MoOraoken
near the postoffloe. Together with
Mayor Riordan they retorned to the.
Boeneof the shooting and parties in the
building state that when tbe auto ar
rived at the foot of the stairs another
shot waq heard and upon investigation
Swingle waq found breathing his last'
having shot himself thru the bead.
Tbe woman waa rushed to tbe Sis
ters Hospital where Doctors Geyerman
and Wheeler dressed tbe wound and
altbo In a serious oondition it is
tboaght she will recover.
