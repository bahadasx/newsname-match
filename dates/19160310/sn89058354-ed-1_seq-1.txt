One day this week T. B.
Fairleigh, N., C. & St. L.

Leaving his office, Mr. Fair

another part of the room,
where two other men were
sitting, to the place where the
man sat who was spitting so
much, remarking "If you
gentleman are not using this,
I see a ; man over here who

All of the bottling machinery
having been installed, the local
plant of the Coca Cola Bottling
Company, located on Blythe
street, will begin operations
Friday or Saturday of this week
with a capacity of 200 cases
daily,
It is probable that this capacity
will be increasen later.
F. C. Hightower has been in
charge since work commenced
on the building some months
ago, but will leave in a short
while after operations begin.
Frank E. Moore, of Browns
ville, will be manager of the

HALF MILLION NEEDED
FOR CONSTRUCTING
COUNTY'S HIGHWAYS
Wheji the April term of the
next first Monday, the members
tion for the purpose of allowing
a bond issue of $500,000.00 for
county.
During the present winter
dition throughout the county,
were talking on Monday, there
of a bond issue.
I have never before fajpred a bond issue, but I have come to
the conclusion that there is no other way to get pike roads," stated
one farmer, who had driven fourteen miles to Paris, when talking
with a representative of The Parisian. This sentiment was endors
ed by numerous others.
It is pointed out that a bond issue of $500,000.00 would put
good graveled roads throughout the county and that an issue for a
less amount would only bring temporary relief and construct only
a few roads. ,
When the court votes to submit the issue to the people as
many expect will be done, it does not mean that the bonds will be
issued, a majority of the people of the county will have to first vote
favorably on the proposition.
that the people have recently decided that there is no other solution
for the road problem and that the proposition will carry before the
people. , ,
Friends of the plan are active
are being urged on every hand to
the question.
OFFICER
CAUGHT
HISJVIAN
Deputy Sheriff Hardin, of
Robertson county, arrived in
Paris Wednesday morning and a
few minutes after reaching this
city placed under arrest a man
named Alley, wanted at Cedar
Hill on a charge of disposing of
mortgaged property.
Alley was turned over to Chief
of Police A. N. Lindsey, who
locked him up at the police sta
tion until Wednesday afternoon,
when Hardin returned with him
to Cedar Hill.
It is said that Alley, who is a
man with good family connec
tions in Robertson county, ran
away from Cedar Hill with a
woman named Graper and the
latter's daughters, who had been
notified to leave that place. The
women are understood to be
living a few miles from Paris at
present. Alley and the women
arrived in Paris Saturday after
noon. GOVERNOR WILL CONVENE
LEGISLATURE VERY SOON
Within the next few weeks,
probably March 20, Gov. Rye
will convene the Legislature in
extraordinary session for the
purpose of placing Judge Jesse
Edington and Attorney-General
Z. Newton Estes, of Memphis,
on trial.
Judge Edgington is charged
with having accepted bribes and
Gen Estes with incompetence
and neglect of duty. Both deny
their guilt and declare that they

WOMAN
WORKS
A RUSE
For some weeks certain Paris
negroes have been working a
clever scheme on local merchants,
obtaining considerable goods
under false pretenses, officers
believe.
Negro women have been call
ing up stores and telling the
clerk answering the telephone
that "This is Mrs. ,
naming some well known Paris
woman, "and please let a negro
girl who will call later have a
pair of shoes and charge same to
me." It is possible that con
siderable goods have been ob
tained in this manner.
On several occasions the tele
phone operators have notified
the stores that a fraud was being
practiced upon them and pre
vented the scheme succeeding.
A negro girl named Milam was
arrested a few days ago by
Deputy Sheriff H. E. Butler and
placed in jail, when she present
ed herself at a local store and
asked for some goods that the
clerk had been told over the
telephone to let her have.
are being persecuted by those
desiring them out of the way for
political reasons.
A committee of Memphis law
yers investigated the charges
against them. The Memphis
bar recommended that Judge
Edgington be tried, but that
charges against Gen. Estes be
dropped. The extra session will
hear charges against both, how
ever, it is said.

YOUNG MEN PRACTICE
SONGS ON CITY STREET
Monday afternoon which
was first Monday two young
men were seen practicing
songs from a hymn book, prob
ably purchased that day, while
sitting on the steps at the en
trance to the city hall.
The young men were very
much interested in their song
book, and while not singing in
p. very loud voice, their notes
were plainly audible to passers
along the crowded sidewalk.
As stated, they had probably
just bought the book from
some local firm and could not
wait until they reached home
to try some of the songs.

Primary For Representative Is
Likely FollowingCommittee
Meeting Saturday
CHAIRMAN GARDNER CALLS ;
COUNTY COMMITTEE CONFAB
Gen. J. W. Lewis Mentioned
For Member Of Platform
Committee Place
Plans for the election of dele
gates to the state Democratic
convention and lor the nomina
tion of a Democratic candidate
for Representative will be dis
cussed and adopted at a meeting
of the Henry County Democratic
Executive Committee, which has
been . called to be held in the
county court room Saturday af
ternoon, March 11 at 1 o'clock,
by T. B. Gardner, chairman of
the committee.
Under the ruling of the state
committee a notice of at least
ten days must be given between
the date of the committee meet
ing and the selection of delegates
to the state convention, and it is
considered probable that the
Henry '"county "committee will
order a mass convention " to be
held at an early date, and proba
bly Saturday March 25, for the
selection of these delegates.
Those who favor the primary '
plan for the nomination of a
candidate for Representative,
point out that the committee is
already committed, in a way,
to this method, as a resolution
was adopted at the meeting
which rescinded the October pri
mary for Representative, declar
ing that a primary would be
ordered at the proper time.
Two years ago the primary
for Representative was held on
the same date as the regular
election in August and this pre
cedent is likely to be followed
this year, it is said. Whether
or not a run-off will be ordered
is not known. In fact, the com
mittee is likely to be governed
largely by the desires of the
announced and prospective can
didates for Representative, who
will probably attend the commit
tee meeting Saturday and make
known their wishes.
An interesting bit of political '
gossip which is going the rounds
is' that friends of Gen. J. W.
Lewis would like to see him
made a member of the platform
committee at the state conven
tion, which will be held at Nash
ville May 17. The delegates
from each congressional district
name a member of the platform
committee, and if Gen. Lewis

physicians state that he is likely

probably lose the use of his left
arm. He was reported resting
well Thursday morning.
