KNIFE AD PISTOL
Effective Combination to Be Car
ried in Pocket
Discharges Small Cartridge, but One
Capable of Inflicting Damage at
Close Range-Useful Defense
Against Burglars.
The smallest breech-loading cannon
in the world is now being made for
pocket use. It is not a toy, but takes
a 22-caliber rim-fire cartridge.
Of course, it is not easy to hit any
thing at a distance with it, on account
of there being no sights and the barrel
being only half an inch long and con
cealed, but a 22-caliber bullet is use
less except at very close range. The
special use of this "cannon" is for
scaring off burglars, as when fired
with a blank cartridge it makes a tre
mendous bang, and fires a bullet that
would Inflict a nasty wound at close
range.
Its inventor Is Edmund C. Moore of
New York. who is also the patentee
of a rifle grenade.
It is in the form of a pocket knife
no larger than the usual knife and has

two blades of fine steel. But at one
end is a hole. Anyone asked to ex
amine the article and say what it is
will be most likely to guess that it is
some new-fangled pencil sharpener or
cigar cutter.
In the end of the knife is a steel
block that turns out on a swivel, being
held by a spring that is released with
the thumbnail and reveals a hole
straight through the block. The car

ready to fire. It is held in the hand

Survival Among Birds.
The struggle of life among the birds
and other wild creatures is so severe
that the feeble and malformed, or the
handicapped in any way, quickly drop
out, writes John Burroughs in Har
per's Magazine. Probably none of them
ever die from old age. They are cut
off in their prime. A weeding out proc
ess goes on from the time they leave
the nest. A full measure of life, the
perfection of every quill and feather,
and unerring instinct, carry them
along. They are always in the en
emy's country; they are always on the
firing line; eternal vigilance and cease
less activity are the price of life with
them. The natural length of life of
our smaller birds is calculated to be
one in a thousand reaches that age.
Not half a dozen times in my life have
I found the body of a dead bird that
did not show some marks of violence.
Mules Now Kerchoo4ng.
Even the mules in the mines here
are suffering from the ravages of the
grippe epidemic and stable horses and
hostlers are kept busy caring for the
sick animals. Many miners declare
that they have caught the infection
from the mules, who sneeze in the
limited air supply in the underground
workings and spread the germs all
over.
The local veterinarians have thus
far vainly sought to find a remedy to
combat the disease. In some cases
quinine and whisky appeared to help
the animals temporarily.-Hazleton
(Pa.) Dispatch to Philadelphia In

War Unkind to the Lawyer.
The war, while having a pretty de
pressing influence upon litigation, is
having a still larger effect upon calls
to the bar. Only 30 students have
donned wig and gown this term, and
half of them bear oriental names, in
dicating that they belong to distant
parts of the empire.--London Mail.

MADE TREE SERVE AS TOWER
California Farmer Solved Windmill
Problem in a Peculiar but Satis
factory Fashion.
A growing eucalyptus, partially
cleared of leaves and branches, has
been used as a
windmill to wer
by a California
farmer. In search
of good running
water, the farmer
found a spring
underneath
a grove of euca
lyptus trees. It
was found that in
order to erect
a windmill stand
ard over the
spring it would
be necessary to
sacrifice the
beautiful t r e es.
Finally solving
the problem of
building the
windmill without
destroying t h e
trees, he mount
..x . ed the fan on one
of the central
trees. Clearing away much of the
foliage on the nearest trees, he
ran braces to the windmill and se
cured a machine which has given
him entire satisfaction. - Popular
Science Monthly.
ONCE A GREAT STRONGHOLD
Kaminiets Polish Fortress That Pro
tected Europe Against the Bar
barians of Asia.
Kaminiets Podolsk, the city upon
which the latest uarge-scale Russian
offensive was based, that against the
Austro-German lines in eastern
Galicia and Bukowina, was at one
time the greatest fortress in the king
dom of Poland, the stronghold that
held back the wild hordes of Asia
through many years of battle, says a
war geography statement given out by
the National Geographic society. The
Tartars struck time after time against
its high. rocky bluff in vain, and many
skirmishing parties of Poles and Rus
sians left the fortress to carry terror
into the steppe around the southern
Dnieper.
The town lies but a few miles from
the Austrian frontier, and is built over
a peninsula formed by the Smotritch
river, an affluent of the Dniester.
Odessa is 235 miles in the southeast,
and Klef about an equaz distance in
the northeast. Kaminiets is the seat of
administration of the Podolian govern
ment, and, since the war, it has be
come important as one of the larger
supply depots just back of the Rus
sian front. It is divided into two
parts, one, the old town, spreading
over the hills, while the other nestles
around the base. Across the river, the
ancient castle still frowns defiance up
on the country, though its war-worn
walls could offer but little resistance
before the power of modern guns.
"Batu, the cruel legder of one of L
the waves of Mongol buccaneering
against Europe, laid Kaminiets waste
in 1240. In the fifteenth and six
teenth centuries, storm after storm
of Tartar. Turk and Moldavian inva
sion broke upon its walls, and the
principal industry of the people of
this outpost became that of fighting
and weapon forging. The adventure
some from all parts of Europe found
their way into garrison there, and
took part in the great drama in which
the East was finally turned back upon
itself. The city passed to Russia in
1795."
USE FOR POCKET FLASHLIGHT
May Be Made to Serve the Purpose of
the X-Ray When Minor Operation
is in Question.
James M. Kane of Doylestown, Pa.,
sends to Popular Mechanics Magazine
an account of how a splinter may be
found under the finger nail. To remove
a splinter in that position is usually
a matter of guesswork, for it cannot
be seen unless its end projects.
Putting the finger over a pocket
flashlight in a dark room makes the
splinter show up as if it were under
the X-rays. Many surgaons use the
flashlights now for illuminating the
throat, pharynx and mouth.
Want KIsses Sterilized.
The New York health board is out
for the sterilized kiss. "You've got to
stop kissing while the present grippe
epidemic is on." says the director of
the bureau of public health education.
"The deadly grippe bacilli love nothing
better than to spring from the depths
of a lover's throat, speed across the a
bridge made by a kiss and jump with
clutching tentacles down the throat
at the other end of the kiss. If you
kiss when you have grippe you are al
most certain to transmit the malady
with your affection." Grippe or no t
grippe, Broadwhy celebrated the New a
Year with promiscuous kissing. Five
minutes before midnight every gllm
mer in the restaurants were put out,.
Sthe order was "let kissing be On
