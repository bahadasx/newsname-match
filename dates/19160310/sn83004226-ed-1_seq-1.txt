W. H. MAGGARO ELECTROCUTED
AT C. AND O. DEPOT AT
PRESTONSBURG.
W. Harrison Maggard, a telegraph
operator at ITeetonahurg, employed by
the C. & O. railway, was electrocuted
at nine o'clock Wednesday night while
on duty at the station. Death waa In
stantaneous. He was signalling a freight train by
the use of an electric light suspended
by a cord from the ceiling, holding the
bulb in his left hand. At the same time
he grasped a lever controlling the block
signals. This lever was heavily charg
ed with an electric current and In tak
ing hold of it he completed a circuit
which sent him Into eternity.
The current evidently cam from
heavily charged wires crossed with
those leading Into the station, said to
have been the line carrying th3 elec
tric power supplied to Prestonshurg by
the Consolidation Coal company's plant.
The heavy storms probably displaced
the line.
Maggard waa a popular young op
erator, 27 years old and unmarried. He
had worked at various points along the
Iilg Sandy division during the past
few years, but for five years has been
located at Prestonshurg. where his
father also lives. The fr.mlly former
ly lived at Harold, Ky.
Karller In the day Win. Ifentlcy, a
Huntington traveling salesman, leaned
against the same block levers and was
so badly eh'K-ked that physicians work
ed with him for an hour or more. He
was able to return to Huntington, but
is to-day reported to be suffering con
siderably.

TRIM YOUR FRUIT
TREES WITHOUT DELAY
A VERY PRACTICAL AND TIMELY
ARTICLE FROM THE COUN
TY AGENT.
Louisa, Ky., March 9, 191.
Editor Hlg Sandy News.
Dear Sir: Kvery season of the year
presents to the farmer a particular
field of work, and his various products
and profits are dependent upon the
readiness with which he grasps the sit
uation. Now is the time for the farm
er to renovate the old orchard and to
start the new one correctly.
Renovation usually falls under the
following heads: Pruning, fertilizing,
plowing and cultivating, cover crops,
spraying riining being of great im
portance I will treat of it briefly.
Pruning requires more study and a
greater variation than any of the oth
ers. Each tree is going to be a prob
lem by Itself. Looking at it in this
way the tree may be pruned normally,
or It may be pruned severely, or It may
be "dehorned," that la the top cut back
aeverely. If the top la not over tall and
there la not much dend wood In it then
It should bo given only a normal prun
ing. If the top is very high and there
are very few water-aprouta lower down
then the top ought to receive a aevere
pruning to atnrt more water-sprouts In
order that It may be dehorned later.
It would be a mistake to dehorn at once.
because there are not enough water
sprouts to take care of tho food Bent
up by the roots.
It la a Common mistake to dehorn
trees which are really ton good for such
drastic treatment If a tree has a rea
sonably good top It Is much better to
do the work gradually. The owner
thus secures some return from his or
chard each year and still the trees are
improving all the time.
Having decided on which of tho three
types of treatment la to bo meted out
to the tree we. begin our pruning. A
safe rule to follow Is to go over tho en
tire tree and tuke out the dead wood
so ns to give a cloar Held for better
Judgment In taking out other limbs.
Branches affected with blight should
come oig altogether. When such limbs
have been removed the remaining
branches should be pruned In such
manner as to give the tree balance
leaving all the fruit spurs possible for
the future crop.
In this renovation work the operator
has to be very careful about the wounds
which are made In pruning. In particu
lar, no stubs should be left and all cuts
should be painted or tarred over to
facilitate the healing process. .
All trees should now be sprayed with
a lime-sulphur solution, which is a
clean up spray preparatory to later
spraying. It is the only thing that will
put the trees In a healthy ciindition.and
every person with a small orchard can
well afford to spray. Karrel pumps can
ha purchased at very reasonable prices
from most dealers. In buying a pump
never get one With less than 100 pounds
of pressure, 200 pound Is better.
This subject can be expanded indefi
nitely but In conclusion to the farmer
I wish to aay, do not put off what you
can do to-day In your orchard till to
morrow, for the un pruned tree, insects
and fungi have no. labor laws to gov
ern working hours.
Very respectfully,
A. C. Y., County Agent

A COUNTY MAP.
Mr, Laban Wallace, of this city, has
just finished the best map of Law
rence county and vicinity ever made.
It showed very plainly and correctly
tho location of every highway and
water course In the county, giving their
names, source and mouth. -
The public roads and in many In
stances the private passways are mark
ed so they can be recognized as such
at a glance. Stores, churches and pri
vate residences, and every school house
are on this map, properly located and
named. The map was made from cor
rect surveys made by Mr, Wallace, who
is a competent surveyor, and is correct
in every particular. It Is a map which
should be In every school house In the
county so that the pupils could learn
from It the physical geography of the
county in which they live, something
of which too many of them are en
tirely ignorant Not only should the
public school houses have a copy of
this map, but It Is a very good thing
to have in ones house or place of bus
iness. Mr. Wallace has had quite a
number of blue print copies made of
this map and offers them for sale at
the low price of one dollar each. The
map is about a yard wide by 42 or 43
inches long, printed on heavy paper.
and with proper care will last a long
time. Those Interested can see one of
the maps in the NEWS office. '

a telephone cable in front of the court

The dummy was cut down by Sena
tor Arnett's brother, Samuel Arnett,
who saw It while he was on his way
to his desk in the Hargis bank about
eight o'clock.
The figure had many bullet holes In
it-
There is no clew to the persona
who participated in the affair, but a
large party of men was heard to
cross the bridge about 2 o'clock thla
morning, and as there had been a lot
of shooting down In the business part
of town a short time earlier. It Is sup
posed that the members of this band
may know something about it
Some dissatisfaction had been ex
pressed here concerning Senator Ar
nett's attitude toward the creation of .
new Judicial districts. He was in favor
of making Wolfe and Breathitt county
a new district it was stated, and la
ter, was said to have been an advocate)
of the movement making a district out
or Wolfe, Morgan and Magoffin coun
ties. ,-:
Senator Arnett Is from West Lib
erty, and has been one of the most
popular Democrats in the mountain
country. He carried Breathitt In hla
race for the Senate by a majority of
1,210, the largest ever given a Demo
crat in any race in this county.
CRUDE OIL IS $1.85.
Seven Cents Per Barrel Added to tha
Price in Kentucky.
Tho price of crude oil has received
another advance. The Kentucky field ,
now receives $1.85 per barret, which in
an increase of seven cents over tho
price of last week. It is predicted the
price will reach $2.00. This belief la
based upon the strong demand for gas
oline and all oil products, and the fact
that production is not keeping pace
with the demand. v

active in the Louisa field this spring.
