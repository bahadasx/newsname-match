PJIQQR^MiOP THE WAK.
IThe sole topic of ,much intereitt along
ihe war fr6nt8 for the week, and since
ftfr. Slst, has been the German drive at
Mfnian.
rPighting
has been more or less
^^•tinuous all the week with the results
Jjhat the Germans have gained some
ground and that many casualties have
occurred.
As one result the Germans have mov
«d closer to Verdun with their big guns
apd have extended their lines around'
sod to the southeast of the city.
The gain in ground would not appear:
to be of niuch vaiue, unless it permits a
giettKi advantage in theiuture invest
ment of the forts about Ve*dun.
The lighting about Verdun extends
over a semi-circle front of probably thirty
or forty miles with very heavy artillery
•nd^ infantry assaults at all strategic
points.
By recent dispatches it is incidentally
feared that some JSngiish troops have
been sent to Yerdun to assist the French.
Rumors were rife that a body of Ger
man ships had left or were leaving Kiel
and that probably a big scaeombat
might be looked for in the near future.
We hardly thing the new« is reliable.
Dispatches from Germany claim that
the German cruiser. "Moeve" has air
•rived at a German port. This is the
cruiser that took tbe"Appam" and sunk
about fifteen other English steamers.
She certainly has bad a wonderful re
cord in escaping British war vessels and
perhaps the most remarkable being the
fact that she ran the cordon of Britisn
war vessels on watch and was able to
arrive safely in a German port.
WHAT THE VOTE MEANS-
The vote in the Senate on tb? resolu
tion referring to Americans taking p»39
pge on armed ships, while overwhelming
in numbers, 68 tj 14, does not in itiielf
express anything particular, except
possibly, that it means that the Senate
does not care to interfere in any way with
the President in bis dffioult diplo
natic work.
In this it is probable that the Sena-
ion
actually represented the general
sentiment of the oountry

mean that the people or a majority of
them approve without question of all of
Mr. WUson's acts, but that because be
is president, that we must acquiesce, for
the good of the country at large even
(bough we may not fully agree.
The resolution itself even if it had
been massed was self-contradictory and
of doubtful moaning.
First, it distinctly expressed the right
of an American citizen to sail on armed
ships. Second, it asked him not to exer
cise that right beoause it might make
trouble for himself and theSJ. 8. govern
ment. Third, it -refused to give the
American citisen passpoits it he sailed
on such a ship.
Which all means that the American
cituen had Jigbts, that ihe ought not to
use the rights, and that he must not use
the rights.
Diplomatically, such a resolution
would certainly have made trouble in
case that an American citisen lost bis
life by the sinking of ship by subma
rine. How could the U. S. aek any sort
of reparation from the country that
owned the submarine, when the U. S.
bad already said by itp Congress, that
the American citisen while he had no
business to be on that ship, had aper
feet right to'be on that ship
It would be rather mixed pvoposi
tion even on tbe U. fl. showing.
WHO PAYS THE "INSPECTOR?"
The approaching "presidential" prim
ary on March list, presents some rather
curious questions.
When this seeond primary election
was added to the'regular state aadconn
ty primary and general election*, the
author attempted to prevent the extra
cost of the third election by grafting it
on to the ordinary city, village ana
township elections by making the state
"presidential" election occur on the
same day and with the same election
boards.
This move however, has resulted about
as successfully as tryiag to make a
wheelbai row into an automobile. With
out going into detail, everybody knows
that the election boards of townships,
and small cities are made on entirely
.different ideAs, methods and numbers
from a regular primary election board.
iPor instance, the chief officer of a
township board is the "moderator" who
is elected, as the first procedure of the
.town meeting on the morning of the elec
tion.
Under the primary law the chairman
of the township board is the "inspector"
and tbe judges of election are appointed
by
the party committees.
No such officers are known to the law
governing township elections.
Townships and small cities do not
bold their local elections under primary
laws. The moderator and two judges
are selected by the township voters pre
sent at the meeting.
Under the primary laws, ballots must
be posted by tbe "inspector" (ranking
official of tbe boards) live days befoie
election. As sueh officer under tbe
township and city laws, he may not have
anything to do with the civic election,
except probably as a candidate.
Tbe board of county commissioners
have decided (and la^t week repeated
the decision) ihrtt the county does noi
have to pay the election officers of the
"presidential primary," but that they
are local officials and to be paid by the
township or city.
Now what about pay for tbe labor of
tbn inspector in porting tbe ballots five
days before election?
Tbe township won't pay him because
he did no work for township. He wasn't
even an election officer for township.
The iaboier Id worthy of his hire—but
in this case whose hirad man is be?
Did you bear of Mr. Enerbrook who
is a candidate for president of tbe Unit
ed States? Tbe Pioneer Jbixpresa office
has been flooded with literature the last

PEMBINA, PEMBINA COUNTY,
A aerloaa problem is confronting
fanaenof Manitoba andoth«r
provlnoes ht the weat this year on
count of the war. The enormous _v
listmentof young men that is going m)t
everywhere is draining the oountry uf
the help that is usually employed to
the land. The qgricultucal departmei
of the provinces are taking the raatts^
up and they are trying to solve the pibj
blem. Instances have been reported
where 180 per month (or eight month!
have been asked by those who have net
enlisted and are looking for w«H|
These wages of course are prohibit!
when it is taken into consideration
everything else have gone up in pricf
except the product from the farm whiclf
is nearly the same as it was before va^t
started. It has been suggested that the
government abolish foreign labor re
strictions which will give the farmers fjj
chance to send to the United States foc|
help. Here along the border it matter^
but little, for laborers come and go at
will, only they have to report at the im«
migration office, but in the interior it
different.
THE VALUE OF I.AND IN FRANCE*
What is land worth per acre—in
France?
||The despatches from the battle fielda
about Verdun tell us that in two ween
battle that the Germans have gained
about six square miles of territory.
These despatches also mention the
losses in killed and wounded as being
very great and while accurate figures
are not known and .perhaps will never be
exactly known, yet the estimates for the
losses to tbe German army are put at na
less than 100,000 men,
Such numbers are not easy to the
comprehension of ordinary people, in the
bulk form. To most of us it just seems
"a great many."
Just what such losses mean may bet''
ter be realized by dividing these great
numbers into smaller units, just as we
might see, if we were to walkover the
fields
BO
plentifully fertilized with humau
blood.
As we say, we do not know the exaet
number of dead, wounded and missing
St Verdun, but perhaps it would not be
out of the way to estimate tbe losses oRj
both sides sb at least 16(^100.
That is, the value of six square milpi
in killed and mained. *No# using rouml
numbers for convenience and more ready
comprehension we have results liltjf
these.
Six square miles (sections) of land
have 2I8IO acres. Let us say 4.000 acres
of battle field.
Then this means then, that each acre
cost 10 dead and 80 wounded and mis*
sing.
If the dead were buried where they
died evenly per quarter section, there
would be 1,6U0 graves to eaoh 160 acres,
or 3,200 graves on the average half sec
tion farm as we have in this country.
Farmer folk can just look out their own
windows ana with a very little imagina
tion can realise what that would mean.
To get at Verdun, just think of six sec*
tions of graves like this,
For townspeople, we may compare
with the block as platted. Blocks usual
ly run about four hundred feet square
and contain approximately a little less
than four acres. Tbe more populous
blocks in this city of Pembiua have
about forty persons as residents, about
ten persons to tbe acre.
That is if all tbe persons living in say
block 21 in this city were killed and
buried in that block it would just equal
the number of graves in tbe fields out
side of Verdun if tbe dead there were
buried in eqval aries. and—out of four
men hit only one is killed.
What those 4,000 acres cost in powder
shot and shell, in cannon and the count
less other war expenses, is too fabulous
for comparison. What tbey have and
will cost in tears nnd poverty is also in
calculable. We can only see and realize
a little of it. What we do know is so
bad. and horrible that it almost over
whelms the imHgina^ion.
Six acres of land in France cost 10
dead 30 wounded. Oh tbe tiurror of it.
Wh do men buy and sell land at such
an awful price?
Tbe old saying that "what three
knows the world knows" is proving true
in re*ent political iievelopniriiis.
