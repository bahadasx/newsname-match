LONDON, Mar. 10. An official Paris statement contradicts the German
claim to the capture of the fort and village of Vaux. Paris declares that the
greatest part of the Corbeaux woods remains in French hands, despite the
German intimation to the contrary. Paris reports a momentary let up in
the battle of Verdun. Reports from Salonlki say they believed that the
allied forces there are preparing to launch a great offensive movement about
May 1st. The British admit the loss of the torpedo boat destroyer Coquette
and torpedo boat number eleven, with a loss of four officers and forty-one
men. The sinking of the French line steamer Louisiane, presumably by a
submarine operating off the French coast, Is announced. No lives were lost.

LIFE SENTENCE FOR WALTER .UflUEEH
Walter Kermeen, a former resident
of Tonopah, who was sentenced to
death in Arizona for the murder of an
acquaintance, with whom he was out
hunting, will not die on the gallows.
A telegram received at 5 o'clock
yesterday afternoon Dy the editor of
the Bonanza stated that the Arizona
board of pardons and paroles had com
muted his punishment from death to
imprisonment for life. This was the
result of a most solicitous and untir
ing endeavor on the part of his aged
mother and other relatives to secure
affidavits from Goldfleld and Tonopah
people, state officials and dthers,
which were gladly given by all who
knew him and knew the circumstan
ces in the case. In addition, a num
ber of telegrams and letters were sent
to the pardon board. Borne at the very
last moment.
Although not a relative, one of the
most active persons in Walter Ker
meen's behalf wns Harry Lefkovits,
who had stores in Tonopah, Goldfleld
and Rawhide, and who is now in busi
ness at Phoenix. It is expected that
the next step In the case will be to
subject Kermeen to an examination
by alienists to discover if possible
what mental malady caused him to
commit his erratic and criminal acts.
