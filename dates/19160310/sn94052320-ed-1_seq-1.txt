Text of McLemore Resolution, Which Brought Fight
Between President and House to a Decisive Issue
Washington, D. C The text of the
McLemore resolution, following a
lengthy preamble, la as follows: '
"Resolved, That the house of repre
sentatives of ths 64th congress of the
United Stales do and it hereby eolemn
ly does, request the President to warn
all American citlaena within tha bor
ders of tha United States - or Its pos
sessions, or elsewhere, to refrain from
traveling on any and all ahipa of any
and all of tha powers now or In future
at war, which ahip or ahipa shall
mount guna, whether such ahip by
frankly avowed a part of the naval
forces of the power whose flag it fliea
or ahall be called a merchant ahip or
otherwise, and whether such gun or
guns or other armament be called 'of
fensive' or 'defensive,' and In caae
American cltitena do travel on auch
armed belligerent ahipa that they do
so at their own risk.
, "That whenever the President of
the United SUtea or the Secretary of
Stats ahall coma Into possession of tha
actual memorandum of tha German
government, containing photographic
facaimiliea of alleged secret Instruc
tions direct that so-called 'defensive
armament for merchant ahia' ahall be
used offensively and that so-called 'de
fensive armament for merchant ahipa'
ahall be manned and directed by naval
Churchill Raps Navy..
. London Winston Spencer Churchill,
former first lord of the admiralty, now
colonel and fresh from the trenches,
sprang back Into the parliamentary
arena Wednesday in a daring speech,
answering First Lord of the Admi
ralty Balfour, who had just presented
tha naval estimates, and declaring that
the admiralty lacked driving force and
must be revitalised before it waa too
late by bringing back Lord Fisher, the
former first sea lord, to head the ad
miralty administration. Hia speech
caused considerable comment.
Four Die In Hot Water Vat.
Connellsville, Pa Four men were
drowned and others Injured here Wed
nesday when the roof covering a vat of
hot water In the Baltimore A Ohio
railroad ahopa collapsed in the course
of a religious meeting. The men had
assembled to hear a talk by an evan
gelist who ia conducting services in
one of the churches, and several
climbed to the top of the vat, which
collapsed. Six men were saved by tha
prompt action of persona nearby.

White House with some of tha cabinet
trooped about him. Ha told them ha

congress.

sensions In congress, which have bean
represented In foreign esplUls aa Indi
cating that ha waa making hia de
manda on Germany in direct opposition
to tha sentiment of the elected repre
eenUtivee of tha people. President
Wilson now stands prepared to go on
with tha aubmarlna negotlationa with
tha central powers.
The next step probably will bo an
answer to Germany's laat proposal to
settle tha Lusitania case. In which tha
United Btstea probably will ask
for such further assurances as it con
siders sufficiently broad and complete
to guarantee that tha new aubmarlna
campaign, which began on March 1
and in which notice haa been given
that all ahlps carrying guna will be
sunk without warning, will not endan
ger Amerelana traveling tha aaaa on
merchant vessels.
The President and hia advisers re
gard tha action of tha bouse aa a suffi
cient answer to reports circulated In
Berlin, sent from Washington, that
congress stood two to ona against him
in tha crisis.
"Stand by the President and do not
embarrass him in hia diplomatic ne
gotiations with foreign countries,"
waa the whole burden of the argument
of the admlnlatration leaders.
They paid little attention to the In
volved legal phases of the altuation.
It was enough, they argued, that the
President had aald the reported atti
tude of eongreea as opposed to hia pol

that they stuck.

by almost all the Democratic speak

debate, to Chairman Flood, of the for
