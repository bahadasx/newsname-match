The Hunt steam roller received
an awful jolt at the meeting of
the Democratic State Central
Committee held in the Blue
Room of the Adams Hotel Phoe
nix Saturday
The fun began when Mulford
Winsor of Yuma who was pres
ent with a bunch of proxies in
one hand and a bunch of resolu
tions in the other made an at
tempt to force his motion for a
committee of five on credentials
and a similar committee on reso
lutions something unusual in the
way of organizing the committee
meeting and was declared out of
order by Chairman Duffy
It happened in this way Geo
Purdy Bullard made a motion
which was duly seconded that a
credentials committee be named
consisting of one delegate from
each county for the purpose of
organization This was the usual
procedure Immediately after
Mr Bullard took his seat Mr
Winsor arose and made a motion
that a committee of five be ap
pointed by the chairman as a cre
dentials committee and a com
mittee of five be appointed by the
chairman as a committee on reso
lutions
When Mr Winsor sat down
Mr Bullard arose and addressing
the chair stated that Mr Win
sors motion was unusual and not
following the regular procedure
in organizing the committee and
further that in view of a well
defined rumor that an attempt
would be made to indorse the
candidacy of Governor Hunt for
governor it would be unfair for
the central committee to adopt
such resolutions which might be
brought in by such a committee
as proposed by Mr Winsor
placing the committee on record
as in favor of a candidate now in
office as against any other candi
date and that it would be also
unfair to the chairman of the
committee whom it was ru
mored was a candidate for the
supreme bench to have the pres
ent incumbent indorsed by the
committee that it was not the
business of the committee to in
dorse any candidates
After Mr Bullard took his seat
Chairman Duffy proceeded to ar
nounce Mr Winsors amendment
to Mr Bullard 8 motion when a
point of prder was made by John
F Weber of Graham county
that as Mr Winsor was not a
member of the committee and
not entitled to the floor he could
not offer an amendment to the
motion
Chairman Duffy then declared
that Mr Winsor could not make
the amendment
Mr Winsor then got one of his
lieutenants Delegate Houser of
Gila county to make the amend
ment
The amendment was then put
to vote and was lost by a vote of
16 to 11 The original motion
carried and the credentials com
mittee was named in the usual
way
The credentials committee re-

Superior Court for Judge Laine
ported favorable on all proxies
and the meeting proceeded
Then Mr Winsor moved that a
committee of five be appointed
on resolutions Mr Bullard made
an amendment that the com
mittee on resolutions be composed
of one member from each county
Then came Mr Winsors sec
ond jolt when the vote on Mr
Bullards amendment showed
that it was carried 39 to 28
The old steam roller began to
wobble
Joseph H Morgan then moved
that the committee on resolutions
be instructed to limit itself to the
indorsement of the national ad
ministration This brought out
another outburst from Mr Win
sor and he made a motion to lay
Mr Morgans motion on the
table
The steam roller got it bad this
trip when Mr Winsors motion
was declared lost by a vote of 42
to 25
Neil Bailey of Yavapai then
moved that a committee on reso
lutions and one on apportionment
be appointed The motion carried
unanimously and the committees
were appointed as follows

Just before the committee ad

of fifteen women from the Phoe
nix local of the Congressional
Union for National Suffrage
headed by Mrs Inez Struck
meyer asked that the committee
adopt resolutions urging congress
to pass on to legislatures of the

tution for equal suffrage
Dr Sampson of Navajo moved
that the resolutions be referred
to the committee on resolutions
with instructions that it be in
cluded in its report The motion
carried unanimously

about 300 oclock Mr Bullard

16 Americans Killed
Columbus N M March 9
Francisco Villa with 1500 men
raided United States territory to
day He attacked Columbus
killed at least sixteen Americans
and fired many buildings before
being driven back across the
border
At least 250 cavalrymen fol
lowed the Villa bandits into Mex
ico and the reports of Colonel
Slocum today stated that Villa
made a stand fifteen miles south
of the border where spirited
fighting ensued An unnamed
private was killed Jand a captain
wounded
A small detachment of troopers
under Majors Tompkins and Lind
sley fighting dismounted made
a determined stand against the
renewed Villa attacks and at last
reports are holding their ground
The raid on American territory
proved costly to Villa The bod
ies of eighteen Mexican bandits
including Pablo Lopez his second
in command were gatnerea to
gether and burned before noon
and the troopers reported an un
determined number of dead still
lying in the brush
Led to the attack under the
slogan death to Americans
the bandits fought with despera
tion Just before dawn they
crept along the ditches skirting
the United States cavaly camp
rushed the sleeping town and
fired hastily
The first volley brought the
American trooper into almost in
stant action and while a portion
of the raiders engaged the cav
alrymen others applied the torch
and the shooting of American
civilians venturing from build
ings
Many civilians barricaded them
selves in their homes and fired
on the Mexicans as they darted
through the streets The fight
ing ended as suddenly as it be
gan and two hours after the first
shot was fired the Villa buglers
sounded the retreat The raiders
fled in disorder with the Ameri
can troopers closely following

INDORSE PRESIDENT
State Democratic Committee
Favors Vice President Mar
shall and Suffrage
Indorsement of President Wil
son and Vice President Marshall
for renomination apd reelection
of national woman suffrage and
of preferential primaries for
president delegates to national
conventions and of national com
mitteemen is voiced in the fol
lowing resolutions passed unani
mously by the Democratic State
Central Committee at its meet
ing in Phoenix March 4th
The State Democratic Commit
tee of Arizona having in the
course of the performance of its
duties and functions been regu
larly called together it is deemed
appropriate and fitting to sol
emnly renew its allegiance to the
glorious cause of a government
of for and by the people in
which the activities of the demo
cratic party find their best and
tiniest expression to give voice
to the commendations so gen
erally and generously expressed
by citizens of the State of all
political affiliations of recent
democratic achievements and to
indicate those measures of na
tional legislation or of party
policy as by reason of changing
conditions increasing enlighten
ment and growing needs are
pressing for affirmative action
Therefore Be It Resolved by
the State Democratic Committee
of Arizona voicing the unani
mous sentiment of progressive
democracy and of hosts of pat
riotic progressive citizens of
other parties that no words can
too warmly or enthusiastically
portray the pride the gratifica
tion and the confidence inspired
by the administration of that
democratic president of all the
people of the United States
Woodrow Wilson whose exalted
patriotism typifies the highest
ideals of American tradition and
whose calmness in the midst of
unspeakable perils and skill in
the guidance of national inter
ests through a time of constant
and unheard of danger stand as
unexampled monuments to dem
ocratic capacity and democratic
efficiency The necessity for a
tried and strong man in the presi
dential chair under existing con
ditions inperatively demand the
renomination and reelection of
President Wilson We hereby
pledge our delegates to the Na
tional Democratic Convention to
his support
Believing that the record of
the Honorable Thomas R Mar
shall as Vice President entitles
him to renomination and reelec
tion we hereby express the pre
ference of Arizonas democracy
for his selection as the partys
vice presidential nominee
Be It Further Resolved That
the true sentiment of Arizonas
superior electorate as voiced at
the polls under a system of legis
lation which constitutes a crown
ing achievement of Arizona dem
ocracy and amply vindicated by
succeeding events is for the re
moval of all abridgement of the
suffrage by reason of sex and
that in obedience to that senti
ment Arizonas democratic re
presentatives in the Senate and
House of the United States con
gress are hereby requested to
consecrate their efforts their
voices and their votes to the
adoption of the pending amend
ment to the constitution of the
United States providing for na
tional equal suffrage
Be It Further Resolved That
emphatic approval be and is
hereby given to that pronounce
ment of the National Democratic
platform promulgated at Balti
more in 1912 favoring an ex
pression by ballot of the demo
cratic preference for presidential
nominee delegates to the national
conventions and national commit
teemen and though it is found
with regret that in the absence
of any machinery of law for such
purpose for the prevention of
ballot irregularities and for the
payment of necessary expenses
it is impractical to give immedi
ate effect to this declaration it is
the sense of this committee that
the next legislature of Arizona
should without fail enact such a
law

ENATOR ASHURST
INTRODUCES BILL
For Board of Engineers to
Make a Survey of the
Gila River
APPROPRIATION OF 15
The Visit of Messrs Pace and
Merrill to Washington D C
Secures Results
W W Pace and Phil C Mer
rill returned from Washington
D C Saturday evening where
they went about ten days ago as
a committee from this valley to
present to our delegation m con
gress resolutions asking for le
lief from the ravages of the Gila
river during flood times by some
plan of straightening the river
Mr Merrill in an interview with
a Guardian reporter gave the
following interesting account of
the committees visit to the na
tional capital
When Mr Pace and mvself ar
rived at Washington we found
that our delegation in congress
were advised of our coming and
they were ready and anxious to
do all that they could to help the
matter along although they
frankly told us that to make an
appropriation on a nonnavigable
river was something that con
gress had never done there be
ing no provision in the constitu
tion providing for it
They first arranged a confer
ence with Secretary of the Inte
rior Lane at which they were all
present and the result of the
conference was that Secretary
Lane -manifested much interest
in the matter He instructed his
consulting engineer Major W L
Marshall to come here and inves
tigate situation and make report
benator Ashurst then intro
duced a bill in the Senate provid
ing for an appropriation of 315-
000 and the appointment of a
board of engineers to come here
and make a survey of the river
and report on the feasibility and
the cost of the undertaking His
bill was referred to the Commit
tee on Indian Affairs
We appeared before that com
mittee and after hearing our
statement and a strong plea made
by Senator Mark Smith the com
mittee reported the bill favorable
We then had a conference
with Mr Humphreys chairman
of the House Committee on Flood
Control of Nonnavigable Streams
to whom we were introduced by
Congressman Carl Hayden The
bill will be referred to that com
mittee in the House and we
found Mr Humphreys much in
terested in our problem and very
anxious to get an understanding
of the whole matter We feel
that if the bill reaches the House
that it will receive favorable con
sideration from that committee
We also found that to get
this first appropriation and a
survey and report is absolutely
the only way we can go about it
to secure final aid
Just what congress will do
after this first step is taken and
we feel quite confident that Sen
ator Ashursts bill will be passed
remains to be seen
We feel that our trip was not
in vain but that it will take con
stant and continued effort if we
expect to secure government aid
in controlling the river
We have only just begun
As a result of the committees
visit to Washington Z C Prina
received a telegram from Major
Marshall who is in Berkeley Cal
that he would arrive here tonight
In order to bo prepared to fur
nish Major Marshall with alL the
data regarding ownership of
lands abutting on the river the
losses sustained by land being
washed away by the floods and
what further damage to lands
may be done by the river Mr
Prina W W Pace Phil C Mer
rill R G Layton Wm Ells
worth and other members of the
committee appointed by the Gila
Valley Water Users and Farm
ers Protective Association pre
pared a circular which was sent
to all those who owned river bot
tom lands propounding certain
questions as to ownership the
number tf acres what years the
damages occurred and amount of
acreage lost value of land lost
what lands subject to inundation
total value of damages by flood
waters and how many acres may
yet be lost unless present chan
