to the individual bringing in the
largest number of new members in

CITY PRIMARIES.
On next Monday the voters of our
cities, towns and villages will be
called upon to nominate twice the
number of candidate? to be elected
whose names will be put upon the
official ballot to be elected at the reg
ular city election to be held March
27th. Therefore we all should be very
jireful as to who we are to vote for at
both the primaries and at the elec
tion. We have run and are running
this week in brief the history and
biography of each candidate, that Will
announce their candidacy in our pi
per. Some of the candidates will not
announce in our colored paper at all
and yet will announce in their white
newspapers. Those people are not
asking for the colored man's vote, nor
do they deserve it. Therefore do not
vote for any man whose name is not
printed in the Bystander. If they
ask your support you ask them why
they did not announce themselves in
the colored newspaper.

The German empire has served no

merchant vessels with guns it is the

citizens to keep off those armed ships

CHARLES WILCOX
Candidate For Municipal Judge.
To the Citizens of Des Moines
I am a candidate for Municipal
Judge. You know the importance
of this position. I ask your sap-
criminals. A man who thinks of
crime and criminals in terms of an
cient criminology is unworthy to sit
on the Municipal or any other judicial
bench. The eld view considered the
offense, giving little thought to the
offender. All criminals were judged
by fixed standards. Heredity and
environment were disregarded.
Youths and accomplished criminals
were herded together. Reformation
was hardly thought of. But the mod
ern view interprets the crime in the
light ofa scientific analysis of the
criminal, and then applies the remedy
for both the protection of the people
and the reformation of the offender.
The individualization of penal treat
ment is,the great truth for present
day criminal ccience. I am pledged
to this modern, scientific, humanitar
ian, civilized view of crime and crim
inals. The judicial bench is a sym
bol of protection for the people, and
it should also be a symbol of sym
pathy and help for the offender. I
believe the individualization of penal
treatment is one of the most import
ant issues that can be brought to youv
attention.
Second, I believe that I am, espe
cially prepared for municipal judge.
I have practiced in the courts of Id #a
for twelve years. I was selected by
a committee of the legislature to com
pile the Supplement, 191§jJ^tain
iiig aff 'thfe £leYieral and' panhartftnv
laws enacted in Iowa between 1897
and 1913. I also edited the Index to
the Code of Iowa and Supplement.
These works were authorized and
published by the state of Iowa. In
compiling and editing these volumes
(which are used by all the lawyers,
judges and public officials in Iowa\
I became thoroughly acquainted with
Iowa law—its letter and its spirit.
My record is open, and I invite in
vestigation.
I respectfully solicit your vote.
Charles S. Wilcox.
JOE
MEYER FOR MUNICIPAL*
JUDGE.
Judge Joe Meyef is well liked by
cur people. They have a good many
reasons for supporting him. They
feel that Judge Meyer gives ,them a
square deal without regard to color.
No matter whether a man is rich or
poor, he gets a square deal. The col
ored man has the same show always
as the white man for that fact. We
feel very thankful to the judge. Not
only that, he is fair to everybody and
he tries hard to help men and women.
Judge Meyer has courage and he is
firm where it is needed, but he be
lieves in helping the man or woman
who is
down—-believes
in giving them
another chance, and that i# right.
Men go to him for assistance and
when it is in his power he helps them.
He punishes the guiity just as he
should. But he is a just judge in
every way. His record as police
judge is good. He is very popular in
every part of the city and the colored
people should feel very sure that
Judge Joe Meyer is going to be one
of the four judges elected. In all
the straw votes so far he has lead the
ticket.
To the Colored Voters of Des Moines:
I thank you for your friendship. I
ask you for your support next Mon
day. I will appreciate it very, very
much. I have many good friends
among your people and I want to
meet as many of you as I can. Bui
it will not be possible for me to meet
all of you. I will sincerely thank you
if you will find my name on the vot
ing machine next Monday and vote
for me. I certainly will thank you
heartily. I do thank the many good
colored people who have eprsonally
pledged me their suppojrt. I appreci
ate it and I take this means of gat
ting word to them. .Sincerely yours,
Joe Meyer,
Candidate for Municipal Judge.
J. M. LEONARD.

TO OUR VOTERS.
Notice: On .Monday, March 13th,
you are all called upon to go to tho
polls and vote for one mayor and four
city councilmen and municipal judges.
There are some others, but these are
the most important for us to consid
er. You have a perfect right to vote
for whom you please, but we do hope
you will vote for good men. Thero
are plenty of them in the field and
you need make no mistake in your
selection.
For municipal judgeship we have
one of our own race. One that haa
been with us for many years, but ha3
been tried and proved. He is up for
judge. You all know his name—
Brother Rush. 1 need not urge you
for
you will do this anyway. Then
among our old friends for councilmen
we notice very conspicuously tho
name of Joe Myerly. A staunch
lriend of our race, one that has stood
by us through thick and thin. We
never have asked him for anything
but what it was granted if it was
within his power. Of course Mr. My
erly had the other members of the
council to assist him, which are good
men also, and he will not take all this
credit to himself, but we speak of
him particularly and we trust that
you will assist him all that you can
when you go to the polls. Mr. Myer
ly has had, as you know, charge of
the street department. A very diffi
cult, vexing and perplexing place in
the council, but nevertheless the city
has made wonderful strides in its
growth and beautiful development un
der his administration. Let us look
for a few minutes at some of the
things which have been accomplished
since he has held this place.
First we notice the comple* on of
the flood protection dam. This was a
great undertaking and was completed
at a cost of some $200,000 The Sev
enth street bridge also was under bis
supervision, and this was also built.
A beautiful structure at a cost ot
$114,000, also the market house has,
been completed. This has been &
gerat benefit to all of us poor people,
and we shall always look upon this
market house as one of his monu
ments We also notice from his rec
ord that there has been 804,372 yards
of paving and 1,356,500 square ieeo of
sidewalk. A fine bridge nas beia
built at Sixty-third street, at tne co.»t
of some $20,000. They have adioi
to our lighting system some 935
more lights, and these lights bur*
all night, instead of only a

handled previously, and it cost the
taxpayer no more than it did whsa
they burn only a part of the time.
There are a host of other things we
could mention, but we have! not_ the
space to mention them. Suffice it
say that he is well qualified a man
of strong personality a genius in -us
department and one that we can trust
and should not be ashamed of. HW
record is beyond reproach.
There is another one for council
man, a new man whose name is John
Budd. Mr. Buda well known h)
our peoyle. He has been connected
with the city engineering d^artmenc
for years, and on everythmg that n—
been accomplished we see the tourti
of his hand, which results beauty.
Now, brother voters,
