March 2, l'Jlfi.) '
When 1 began to think of this sub
ject I had many misgivings as to my
ability to give you anything at all
interesting or helpful on il. b t 1
fi ially picked up a book from our
llbraiy on Patriotism, and i read so
many inspiring articles on tbe sub
ject there, that 1 felt truly filled
with the spirit of the patriot, and
I am going to try, here
ginning of my subject to puss some
of tills inspiration on to you bv quot
ing a few uf the thoughts tliat so fill
ed me witli interest and enthusiasm.
"Patriotism—love of country—de
votion to the land that bore us!"
"Whit is it to love ones country? Is
it to carry a banner in a procession?
Is it tn shout as we sep the Hag? Is
it to fling bunting from tiie t ips of
the buildings and send off sky rdekafts
in tiie evening? Vastly deeper than
this is tiie love of country—deeper
than soldier's uniforms or pictures
of battle ships! To love your country
is to love that for which your coun
try stands" (Rev. W. il. P. Faunee.)
"Tiie man who loves his country
loves tiie nobility, the freedom for
which ids country s;ands. He loves
tiie ideal enthroned in his country's
history, the principle which runs
through all the story of ids countrv's
past, Hie ideals which were set be
fore Ids fathers, their institutions foi |
which these father's lived and suffer-1
ed. The man who loves tliat for ;
whicli Ids country stands, in- and lie i
alone is tiie man wliu loves idsj
country."
"What 1« it to love your bottle? I » ;
it to love the house or tiie furniture, j
No, it is to love tiie. ideas I -r which i
your home stands; to love Hie way !
tilings are done there; to love the |
people who dwell there, tiie prim i- !
pies upon which tfie Imme is built.
And so it is witli wur native land."
"Hliatis this country—this um h- j
er country—lids fatherland tliat wp
are bidden to love and serve and j
stand by at any risk and sacrifice, j
I s it tiie soil? tiie land? the plains
and mountains aud rivers? tbe fields'
and forests and mines? no doubt there :
at the lie-1
is inspiration from this very earth. .
Hul a lam) is not ling wilhuut the
men. It Is tiie nation, not the land
which makes the patriot if tiie
tion degenerate tiie land becomes '
only a uiuiiiiinent, not a dwelling." j
Arcli Bishop Ireland says, "Patriot-j
ism is innate in all men ; the absence
of it betokens a perversion *»f human !
nature: but it grows its full growth
only where thoughts are elevated
and heart beatings are generous "
Tiie wise parents know tliat patri
otism is the result of growth, and
knowing tills lie will endeavor t.
train his children fiom their earliest
years in service for tlie common
Tiie faithful performance of reg
ul*rly recurring duties will lend to- [
ward this training. Always some
