Washington, D. C.', March 10.—President Wilson to
day ordered American troops over the Mexican border to
capture or kill the Villa bandits who yesterday raided
Columbus, N. M.
Major General Scott, chief of staff of the army, an
nounced that the expedition would consist of not less than
5,000 men, all of which are available on the border under
Major General Funston.
In its present stage the President's order does not
mean armed intervention in Mexico. It provides for a
punitive expedition to deal with lawless forces over which
the Carranza government has no control.
10 The following statement was issued at the White House:
"An adequate force will be sent at once in pur
suit of Villa with the single object of capturing
him and putting a stop to his forays.
"This can be done and will be done in entirely
friendly aid of the constituted authorities in Mex
ico and with scrupulous respect for the sovereignty
of that republic."
WANTS VILLA DEAD OR ALIVE
It was said at the White House that the American government
wants Villa dead or alive and that no steps will be neglected to carry
out that object.
It was declared that the United States will not consider the
punitive expedition an invasion of Mexico and will continue to deal
with the Carranza government. The American government is still
opposed to armed intervention in Mexico but has decided that the
peace of both Mexico and the United States is imperilled by the con
tinued activities of Francisco Villa.
The cabinet was unanimous in deciding that Villa must be
caught.
ORGANIZED PURSUIT OF VILLA
It was said that the pursuit of Villa will be undertaken in a com
prehensive way and organized plans jvill be laid for his apprehension.
Officials received the word of the decision to go after Villa with
troops with undisguised satisfaction.
Cabinet members expressed themselves as greatly pleased. Army
officers voiced unanimous approval. A general feeling of relief that
the administration had finally decided to take the step was ap
parent. . ..
The President himself is firmly . on- Will Notify Ctantona
xinrcd of the necessity of eliminating
Villa from the .Mexican situation. He
is represented as just as determined
to oust Villa as he was to oust Vic;
toriano Huerta.
The announcement of the intention
of the President to send troops into
Mexico was accompanied by scenes
not equalled by those at the White
House since the determination to send
the Atlantic fleet to Vera Crui in
1914.
Pains were taken by officials to
point-out their hope that General Car
ranza would realize the spirit in which
♦he American troops were being sent
after Villa.
