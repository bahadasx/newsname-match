County Road Supervisor Appointed.
Duetto theact that State Road
pected to be quite fully occupied with
directing the work on the Parowan
Lund road, and further on account of
the largo expenditures in tho south
ern portion of the county, and partic
ularly in the canyon east of Cedar
City, it was deemed advisable to have
a county road supervisor in addition
to the state man, whose business it
will be to look after tho roads within
the county not designated as state
highways. For this purpose the name
of Heber C. Jcnson was recommended
by Commissioner Lunt, and 'the ap
pointment was made 'by the Coinmta

road supervisor, for the county roads,
and by the state road commissioner
for state roads, and will be confirmed
by the county commissioners.

COMMERCIAL CLUB
is ran
Two Enthusiastic Meetings Held
and Club Has More Impetus
Than for Some Years.
SUITABLE QUARTERS
ARE TO BE OBTAINED
Definitely Decided that There is Need
for Commercial Club in Cednr City
Social Side to be Feature.
Never since Its first inception was
the prospect brighter for a live, en
ergetic nnd progressive Commercial
club in Cedar City than at the present
time. Two rousing meetings have
been held this week, the first one on
Tuesday evening and the latter loRt
night, in tho Library auditorium, and
more enthusiasm and interest has
been manifested than for a long time
past.
At the first meeting the proposi
tion as to whether or not. Cedar City
really wanted a Commercial club -whether
or not there was a plnce In
Cedar City for a live organization of
this kind was put fairly up to those
present by the outgoing officers, nnd
it caused them to stop and think ser
iously of the matter, instead' of mere
ly taking it for granted that the club
was here to stay and would remajn.
and continue to wrestle with such
questions, qs might c9me hpfaro it
without any concern on the part of the
majority of tho citizens. The result
was that thoso present voted practic
ally unanimously to get behind the
club with their influence and means
and make It a power for good in the
community and county.
lhwufliJHf .MnuBtotirfar'rii ' trt "";
It having been definitely and for all
decided that the club should not only
be perpetuated but rejuvonnted and
rehabilitated as well, the eloction of
a set of officers to serve during the
next year was proceeded with, and
resulted in the choice of the follow
ing: For president, John S. Woodbury.
For vice-president, Walter Granger,
For secretary, G. Hunter Lflnt.
For treasurer, John P. Fuer.
The question o standing cmmt
tees, or board pf gflvernpVs,' s tft C?W
up for cp,nB,ide.ra$o,ri w, but it is
apparently the concensus of opinion
that there should bo moro frequent
meetings of the club in future, and
that ns a rule questions should come
before the entire membership for dis
cussion and action.
There is also a strong sentiment' in
favor of developing the social side of
the club to a much greater degree in
the future than in the past, and the
question of suitable quarters will be
one of the first matters to receive con
sideration. As n committee to look
into this phase the following were
appointed: John II. Cprry, Clqtqn
S. Rice and Robert S. Gardner. Tcy
are to have a report and recommend
ations ready for the consideration of
the club at a meeting called for noxt
.Tuesday evening ,
The folowing committee was also
chosen to ndviso with the county com
mitteemen with relation to the com
mencement of a fair to be held in
Cedar City next fall, It having been
decided that Cedar City was unwil
ling to waive their right to the fair:
Thomas Dix, Walter Granger,
It appears to bo the wjsh oJ5 the
majority of to, prospective members
of tho club to maintain comfortable,
attractive quarters for the club, in a
convenient and accessible part pf the
business district, where visitors to the
city can be received and fittingly en
tertained, and whore the members of
thte club, can me.et to, talk over ques
tions and obtain recreation.
Rabbitb Get Another Bull.
At tho citizens' meeting in tho Ly
ceum Tuesday night it was decided to
use the strychnine that had been pro
vided by the County Commissioners
as Cedar City's portion of the last
250 ounces at once, without waiting
for a snow storm. Tho proposition of
carrying it over until another winter
was also turned down, because, as re
marked by one of the fnrmers pres
ent, the rabbits that would be killed
another winter would not help the
farmers the coming summer. It was
decided that tho alfalfa leaves should
bo gathered Wednesday and prepared
for use yesterday, and that they wero
then to bo strewn about the haunts of
tho rabbits at soon aa posalblo, before
I tho green feed got any moro start.
GEN PROPERTIES
TO BE EXPLOITED
I
Announcement is Made That the
Company is Financed to t
Equip Propcrt.
AERIAL TRAM BEING
LOADER FOR SHIPMENT
I
Henry Pictsch, who Ik Stockholder in
Company, is Jubllent Over Prospect
Nfor Early Development.
Henry Pietsch, who Is n stockholder
in the compnny organized by Dr. E.
Green for the exploitation of his coal
property on the face of, the mountain i
just southeast of Cedar City, is au
thority for the statement that Dr.
Green has been successful In Califor
nia in finnncing his proposition. Mr. I
Pietsch wob in receipt of a letter the
first of this week from Dr. Green, in
which he states that everything is O. i
K.; that thoy have $35,000.00 in the
treasury for the equipping and devel
opment of tho property, and that a
large aerial tram, which requires
three enrs to transport it, is being
loaded for shipment to the property.
This Mr. Pictsch expects to nrrivo at
Lund within the next few days.
It is the intention to orect this tram
from thp cqal mine to tho valley bo
low and tram the coal to whoro it
can be conveniently loaded at the out
skirts of town, thus cheapening the
price of fuel, and building up an im
portant industry here.
Mr. Pictsch has done a good deal of
development work at the coal prop
erty and has acquired a considerable
interest in tho Bame. He also has n
coal location in his own name, and is
nhi raUyjqWhwttt ffrfc pruBpccts'fu'f
early developments on Ja scalo com
mensurate with the needs of the prop
erty. 4
The equipment and systematic de
velopment of the proporty will not
only mean the employment of a larg'e
number of men here, with a substan
tial pay-roll, but will bo a strong fac
tor In tho securing of the projected
branch of railroad to Lund, of which
we are so much in need. It will .thorti
fore be we'conc "P-W8 to not only
Cedar City, but all this section of
southern Utah. (
OFFICERS CAPTURE
ILLICIT LIQUOR.
Then Interested Parties Burglarize
City Jail and Make Away With
the Entire Shipment.
Seven cases of liquor seized by
County Sheriff John II. Corry, ns
olsted by City Marshal Nelson a.nd
Deputy Hansen, as it was bejng im
ported .by team from MJlford Febru
ary 26, were extracted from tho iron
cage of the city's hastile last Friday
night, by unknown parties, probably
Interested in the shipment of booze.
An entrance was made to the city
hall through a window, nnd tho iron
cage was entered with the aid of a
hack saw, with which the hinges were
sawed asunder. Tho discovery was
made by officers Saturday morning,
and since that time a close watch has
been maintained to try and discover
the perpetrators of the burglaryi for
burglary it is, pure and, shnplei nnd
if the guilty parties are discovered
they will bo taught a lesson that they
will not soon forget.
Tho illicit Importation of liquor is
bad enough, but burglqry is n much
more serious offense under the law.
This serves as an oxample of how one
crime leads to another, and when onco
a person plunges into crime it is im
possible to tell where he ia going to
pull up, or o pulled up,"
No definite Information is given out
by the officers as to tho progress they
aie making on the case, but there Is
little doubt but that sooner or Inter
they will locate tho perpetrators of
the crime and bring them to justice.
Mr. Jennings, tho hotel lobby ad
vertising man, who installs those pret
ty little writing desks, carrying ad
vertising cardB in tho hotels, was in
Iron county again during the past
week and redressed tho local stands.
This is an idea which Mr. Jennings
Invented himself, nnd he made his
first desk while attending school. Now
he is operating over a number of west
ern states and has built up a profit
able business. He i a pleant per
son to meet und a good business man.
CAMPAIGN FOR
PITH PRESS
An Appeal to Every Sincere
Friend of The Record and
Progressive Citizen.
CAMPAIGN WILL COVER
MARCH AND APRIL.
During this Period we Invite Subscrip
tions to Stock and Payment of All
Accounts, Especially Subscriptions.
As nnnounccd through tho editorial
columns of The Record a couple of
weeks ago, we have reached a point
in the development of The Record
where n new printing press, of . in
creased speed and larger capacity, is
an absolute necessity. We need and
have resolved to obtain a new press,
nnd we earnestly request thonld and
assistance of all our subscribers, ob
well as of tho Cedar City public at
large, in procuring it.
The stock books of our company
are open to you, nnd we will be very
pleased to receive your subscriptions
in any amounts from ono dollar to a
thousand dollars. Thoro is something
near $3,600 of the treasury stock that
is yet unplaced, and we appeal to pa
triotic citizens, who are interested in
seeing Cedar City, Iron County nnd
Southern Utah advance, to take up a
portion of this stock nnd placo their
newspaper on a par with the best in
the counties of tho state. $2,000 will
put us in excellent condition to take
care of the business of this section,
not only in tho mutter of an up-to-date
newspaper, but will make such addi
tions to our job printing plant as the
I present business warrants and de-1
. lMaaJMVi..'M.i.,'l:-il,.-lrfrtrfw.-y,. v .
, Two thousand dotlnrs is tho sum we
have started out to raise, and we are
not going to give up until it is in tho
treasury.
i-A Two Months Campaign.
Our campaign will cover tho months
of March and April, unless tho amount
Htatci'is sooner raised. $2,000 is not
a very largo sum. On moro than ono
occasion a smooth-tongued schemer
has come in with a horse of question
able value and sold it for more than
this amount. The improvement of
the local newspaper, which is the me
dium through which the town is to
be judged by people on the outside,
is of far moro consequence than a
horse for breeding purposes.
To those who are not in a .position
to subscribe for stock, we request
that they make it a point to renew
their subscriptions during tho period
covered by tho campaign. In fact,
the soonor tho better. Last year a
great many of you subscribed in or
der to help somo friend in the auto
mobile contest. This year we want
you to renew your subscriptions to
help the pnper obtain u now press and
other equipment for the office. In
helping us, you will also help your
Belvea to a better paper than we are
able to give you with our present fa
cilities. Wo havo a splendid Lino
type machine, and an office and plant
that in most respects is on a par with
the best In tho country, but In tho
matter of our news press and a few
minor details, we are deficient a can
dltion that you and we cannot afford
to let maintain.
Each week we are going to publish
a list of subscribers who assist with
tho "Press Fund" by sending or bring
ing in their renewals. A list of thoso
who havo responded slnco our first
announcement was made is appended
hereto. Get in with them nnd show

a physician in the northorn end of the , M
county, who was unable to locate the ' H
iseat of the trouble. H
As he did not seem to be making sat- -
isfuctory progress, however, ho was H
brought to Cedar City yesterday and H
Dr. Leonard took an X-ray picture of -H
his throat and chest, showing very H
clearly the nicklo well down in the H
esophagus. The child was then put H
on tho operating table and after a gen- H
oral anaesthetic the coin was success- .
fully dislodged and pushed on into - ' jH

well, and there Is little doubt of its ,H
