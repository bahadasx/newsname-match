PER YEAR
WHO WILL BE THE
NEW CITY DADS?
Election Called for April 4th to Determine Who will Have
Charge of the Destinies of the City for Another Term
and Supervise the Expenditure of $35000.00 for
Improvements.
While apparently not much is
being said about the City officers
who are to manage the city's
affairs for the next term, there
is, nevertheless, considerable in
terest iti the matter and specu
lation id ripe concerning who the
candidates might be. This in
terest is doubtless increased bv
the thought that the new city,
dads wilt, in all probability, sup
ervise the expenditure of a con
siderable sum of money for mu
nicipal improvements and paople
will be anxious to know that
these fundi will be judiciously
expended. For the best results,
tor the betterment and upbuild
ing of the city, Clovis demands
a buair.ees administration by
business heads, and not a con
tinuous agitation by agitators
with political aspirations. Just
a plain business administration
by our beJt business men is the
call of the people.
Dame rumor has it that A. J.
VVinnng may succumb to the
will of th'i people whi demand a
business administration andl
agree to income a candidate for
mayor. O'.hers who are more
than prominently mentioned are
I. C. Join sun, W. I. Luikart. V
13. Cramer, Bert Curies. K. C
Ohildcrs, .Ino Birry, A.B. Aus-
tin.Jack Mtrris. Either of tin so
business men would be accept
able to ;i majority of the people,
but it is doubtful if they could
be induced to become condidates.
Certainly they have not aspired
to the position as their extensive
business in'e'rpsts demands their
-.Kidivido l attention.
There are those who favor
Mr. Jolmaon, if he can be in
nuced to make the race, because
of his satis f.ictory service as
alderman and his large and vari
rd experience in public affairs
Like Mr. Waiting, he is one of
the piuneer business men of the
city and in deeply interested in
its future development.
Let the slogan at the coming
flection be "A business admin
istration That's all." 1
Texico Residence
Destroyed by Fire
Texico, N. M, March 6. -The
two story residence of T. J.
Allen burned Saturday after
noon. Miss Minnie Grume, one
of the operators of the telephone
exchange, and Ralph Daniel
escaped death by jumping from
the window of the second story.
When the fire was discovered it
was practically impossible to
save any of the furniture of the
occupants. Miss Crume had
rooms on the second floor and
she with two or three men went
to the rooms to try to save her
belongings. Miss Crume and
Mr. Daniels were cut off by the
flames and their only escape was
by jumping from the window.
Although several men stood be
low and attempted to catch
them, Miss Crume sustained i
broken ankle and other slight
injuries. There was no insur
ance on either the building or
contents and tho loss was quite
heavy, there being only a few I
piects ol lur.nture saved, lhe
house was occupied by City
Marshall, K idgers.
Bankers Meet June 6 and 7.
The Panhandle and Eastern
New Mexico Bankers Convention
meets in Clovis on June 6th and
7th. This was decided upon ut
a meeting of the executive com
mittee at Amarillo one day last
week., The committee expressed
the belief that this would be the
oiggest meeting of bankers in
the history of the organization.
This belief is based on the ex
pression of the leading bankers
of the Panhaldle. Bankers have
taken more occasion to meet and
discuss public affairs since the
outbreak of the great war, than
ever before in the history of the
country.

Big Prairie Fire
One of the largest and most
destructive prairie fires to occur
in this section in years raxed
between Clovis and Melrose last
Saturday. The fire originated
in the tall sand grass just west
of Melrose and fanned by a high
wind, spread with rapidity over
a large scope of country to the
north of St Vrain and Havener.
Many farmers, realizing the
danger, hastily plowed a few
furrows around their farm
houoes and outbuildings and
saved them, but many less for
tunate, lost their stacks of feed,
outbuildings, fences and even
residences. Almost simultane
ously a prairie Are raged on the
south side of the track, which
was checked by the road near
the Doughton farm south of
Blacktower. Sixteen telephone
poles on the line between Clovis
and Melrose were destroyed as
were shacks belonging to Nora
Smick, J. F. Saunders, J, S.
Johnson and several others,
whose names we were unable to
learn. A large quantity
stacked feed was consumed.

says Mr. Cnalfant, "is noc ex
cessive and if properly expend
ed, should bupply the needs of
the city for some time to com.
The water mains should be
extended at the earliest possible
date, both as a necessity and
for better lire protection. Some
of the water mains, which were
ongionally second hand 'are in
bad condition wnd it will be nec
essary to suon replace these.
Some of tne alleys in the more
thickly settled residental sections
do not have a sewerage line and
it will also be necessary to lay
several miles of new line and to
make extensions.

mand for water and light. The
plant is bow taxed to its limit in

In view of these conditions,

money will be judiciously expended.
