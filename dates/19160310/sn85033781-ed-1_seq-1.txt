SAINT PATRICK
NIGHTAT CLUB
Sixth Committee Entertain
Large Company at the
Maple City Club.
Last Thursday evening the sixth com
mittee of the ever popular Maple City
slub entertained the club members and
several invited guests in a most royal
manner at the club rooma. The event
was somewhat of a St. Patrick's affair.
The dinner was served at 7 o'clock. The
tables were very attractive in their deco
rations of white carnations, candles of
green, little flgs of Ireland, and the
ever famous shamrocks a1 favors. The
menu was of the best and very nicely
served by the young people of the com
siit tee.
After dinner all returned to the par
lors, the gentlemen, who so desired, to
enjoy their after dinner smoke, and the
Indies entered into a guessing game that
mused much sport. Miss Irene Lane
proved equal to ibe emergency and cap
tured the prize of a beautiful bouquet
f carnations. Cards aud dancing fur
bished the remaining program.
This committee consisted of Mrs. L.
W. Arnold and son Haydon as chairmen,
assisted by Mr. and Mrs. Ray Wilson,
Mr. and Mrs, Ford Wilber, Mr. and Mrs.
Bert Coiburo, and Messrs. Blaine War
aer, Royal and Vern Decker, and so well
did all perform their part that one of the
most enjoyable evenings of the club was
all too soon to our sorrow a thing of the
past.

Few, if any, Better Quali
fied to Discuss Agricultu
ral Subjects than this
Talented Speaker.
The last meeting of the Fellowship
club held at the Coterie club rooms )ast
Friday evening was one of the most en
joyable of the year. Vne musical num
bers were furnished by Mias Lettie
Tubbs and Blaine Warner. Both were
in splendid voice and their selections
weie heartily applauded.
The address of the evening waa given
by Hon. Jason Woodman. It dealt
principally with the agricultural problem
from both a practical and scientidc
standpoint. "Preparedness'' was really
the keynote of the address and many
comparisons were made between the ag
ricultural methods in vogue in the
United States and those employed in
foreign countries. Mr. Woodman is
also a firm believer in preparedness
from a military standpoint aud made
some pointed allusions to this subject.
Mr. Woodman is the farm agent for
Kalamazoo county. While he retains his
residence in Paw Paw township, a greater
part of his ti.i'ie ia spent in Kalamazoo
county. He has made a life study of
agriculture, is thoroughly in love with
his work and has been of great assist
ance to the farmers as well as blllia0M
men of our neighboring county. It was
indeed a real treat to have him home to
spenk to bis old friends and neighbors.

COTERIE ASSURED
SOLONS' POSITION
On motion, the secretary of the Cotorie
was reqnested to write our representa
tive and state senator in congress urg
ing them to use their influence in behalf
of the Sbeperd Bill for tbe prohibition
of the sale or manufacture of all intox
icating liquors in the District of Colum
bia and also upon tbe National Constit
utional Prohibition Bill which is now
pending in Congress. The secretary re
ceived the following replies
Dear Madam:- I am giving tbe propo
sition for prohibition in the District of
Columbia and the Prohibitive Consti
tutional Amendment my moit conscien
tious attention. I now expect to vote for
tbe former although 1 have not gone
into tbe matter io ail its aspects I will
go into it before 1 am called upon to
vote.
I am not so cleared abojt the latter.
My own idea has been to &llow each
state to settle tbe matter of prohibition
by itself and I would pass a federal law
prohibiting the shipment of intoxicating
liquois from any state into a dry state.
I am in favor of temperance and any
constitutional effective legislation to
that end will have my support.
KeftpV'tfullv yours,
Charles E. Townshnd.
Dear Mrs Baile :- Your letter received
and I am writing you in reply in Mr.
Hamilton's absence. Mr. Hamilton
died Friday Night and he left for Niles
Sunday morning.
He has frequectly stited io response
to inquiries as to bis position on tbe
question indicated in your letter that
there is only one aide to a moral quest
ion and that is tbe right side. I know
there will be no question as to bis posi
tion on the Sheperd bill
Very truly jourr.JJ
Frank L. Hall.
Secretary.

T SETTLED
E. S. Dyckman Wins at So.
Haven Notwithstanding
Endorsement of Committee
for Holmes.
Tbe appointment of E. 8. Dyckman
postmaster at South Haven ends a bit
ter postofflce fight io that city. There
were three prominent candidates for this
appointment, the appointee, S. Van Os
trand and Atfy W. W. Holmes. The
democratic committee met 04 Paw Paw
in December to recommend candidates
for appointment in offices where tha
term of postmaster was about to
expire. After a spirited contest the
committee recrjded tire appoint
ment of Mr. Holmes. ThuT-Yfid.-jot
meet tbe approval of Mr. Dyckman and
his friends, who immediately got busy
to bead off what looked like a sure thing
for Mr. Holmat. This is oue case at
least where a recommendation of a
county committee was not final.
Mr. Dyckman has been one of the stal
warts of his party for years, has the
ability and is popular, not only in South
Haven, but throughout the county. He
will undoubtedly be a worthy successor
to S. H. Wilsoo, who is conceded to be
one of the best postmasters South Ha
ven ever bad.
A successor to Postmaster Merrrimau
of Hartford has also been named. Wm.
H. iilashfield, who was endorsed by tbe
democratic committee io December, wins
the plum. The appointment was made
and sent to the senate last Monday
along with that of Mr. Dyckman's. Mr.
Blashfield is a young business man of
Hartford, who will undoubtedly make
good io tbe new position. Mr. Merri
man has given excellent satisfaction and
tbe new mau will find everything in
order and just as it should be.
PLAINTIFF Ifs JUDGMENT
The Mock Trial given by tbe ladies pf
the Coterie undsr the management of
A. V. Newton which was held at Long
well's opera house Wednesday evening,
was worthy of a much larger crowd.
The seser il parts sere well taken and
the witnesses caused much merriment
by their queer testimony. the jury
waa composed of 12 celebnrties.-j such as
Woodrow Wilson, Henry Ford. Koosevelt
Sullivan and so on. In fact the only
one missed was William Jennings Bryan.
Of course the fair plaintiff was as
near 'winning her case as they ever are.
The'jurors brought in a verdict of $3 48
of wnich amount tbe jurors were to re
ceive 13 00 aud the judge the remaining
48j. It was sure some fun and tbe
crowd should have been much larger,
but the school entertainment comiog
tbe same week undoubtedly drew from
this.
Rev. Shape entertained the audience
with cornet and violin solos that were
much ei j iyed.
They have just received at the Avery
store a new ami up to date line of spring
Costs It kouM urel pay you to call
and see them, if you are contemplating
purchasing a new one this spring. They
will please you, we are confident.
