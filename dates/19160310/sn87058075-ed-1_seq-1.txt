Luxury of Power
The real luxury of motoring is the luxury of Power.
Sooner or later all those who drive motor cars learn that
Power is the thing that makes or mars motor car pleasure
Other things may have a stronger appeal to the eye,
especially to the eye of those who do not know but event
ually they all discover that motoring pleasure and satis
faction can be derived only from the car with the power­

Cresco, Iowa
$1,205.00 for this Attra&ive House.
You would scarcely believe that this building can be built
on a space of ground only 26 feet by 45 feet 6 inches,
exclusive of an 8-foot front porch, lie lines of the
exterior are so designed as to convey the impression of
great size, and as a matter of fadl for a five-room house,
this building contains as great an amount of actual
living room as we have ever seen in a design of this
nature. The sharp pitch to the roof and the large
dormer, allow ample space for the finishing of a couple of
nice sized rooms on the second floor. At

A1 H. Wilson and Company.
That clever comedian and golden
voiced singer A1 H. Wilson and a strong
supporting company is underlined at the
"Cresco", Wednesday, March 22, when
he will present a bran new periodic
comedy song play entitled "As Years
Roll On." In addition to a quaint and
consistent heart story a series of epi
sodes is developed covering
a period of twenty years
from youth to middle age that
will prove widely interesting and en
tertaining and will call for a versatility
in acting never before demanded of
this popular actor's talents. In the
character of John
I
Van
Zam, Mr. Wil­
son will be required to depict a young
man in all the vigor of youth and then
as the years roll on—the middle aged
man and finally the father of a family,
whose nature reveals the softened in
fluence of time, generons to^a fault.
Still retaining all the simplicity of a
loving, whole souled parent whose main
thought is for the wellfare of his child.
In the midst of very funny complica
cations there are moments of pathos
that have a strong appeal and absorb
ing interests.
The play is in three acts with ten
years elapse of time between each act.
A great feature of course will be the
new songs interwoven throughout the
the action. Each a gem of melody in its
way and so rendered in this celebrated
singers inimitable manner cannot fail
to be a rare musical treat, so that his
auditors will heartily agre. with the
following remark of a famous critic
"Quiet folk would promptly accapt Mr.
Wilson's vocal equipment and let that
of Caruso go if the choice were offered
to them." The new songs are entitled
"Yesterday," "As Years Roll On"
"Mother Mine", "She left me for a
Teddy Bear" and others.
A Serious Offense.
One day last week a seven-year-old
boy was detected in the act of taking
through the efforts of some of the pub
lic school teachers.
The penalty for theft from any inail
box is very severe, the federal statutes
providing that whoever shall steal, take
or abstract from any mail box or post
office or other authorized depositary
for mail matter, any article contained
therein, or shall have in his possession
any letter, postal card or other mail
knowing the same to have been stolen,
shall be fined not more than $2000 or
imprisoned not more than five years, or
both.
Owing to the tender years of the cul
prit the disposition the postoffice de
partment will make of the matter is
rather problematical.
Wentworth—Weber.
On Wednesday evening at half past
six, at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Lynn
Strayer of this city, occurred the mar
riage of Mr. Arthur Wentworth and
Miss Lydia Weber, both of Cresco. At
the appointed hour, the couple took
their places before Rev. Will Kirwin,
pastor of the Methodist church, who
read the beautiful ring ceremony and
presented them to the company as Mr.
and Mrs. Wentworth. Immediately
afterwards a sumptuous three course
dinner was served by the hostess, Mrs.
Lynn Strayer. These young people
have a host of very warm friends who
wish for them the greatest joy and
happiness in their wedded life. They
will go to housekeeping in the old
Strayer home on Elm street.
Married
Mr. Homer Clarence Barbour and
Miss Grace Evelyn Scott of Waukon
were united in marriage last Thursday
afternoon at the M. E. parsonage by
.the pastor, Rev. Will Kirwin. The
couple were attended by Mr. Alfred
Haines and Miss Nellie Bradley. Mr.
and Mrs. Barbour will make their
home on a farm four miles east of
Cresco, where the best wishes of their
friends go with them.

Golden Wedding Anniversary
On Wednesday of this week, March
7th, the W. R. C. ladies and G. A. R.
veterans together with their wives and
husbands of both orders, gathered in
their hall over Kellow's store to help
Mr. and Mrs. Squire Towne celebrate
their golden wedding anniversary. Af
ter Mr. and Mrs. Towne had been ta
ken to seats in the center of the hall
where a beautiful rug had been spread
which the Miller Bros, had generously
lent for the occasion, the officers and
color bearers of the W. R. C. gave
their beautiful flag drill, with Mrs.
Nellie White at the piano, after
which they escorted Rev. Gammons to
the couple, who after making some
very interesting remarks, married Mr.
and Mrs. Towne with the ring service,
Mr. Towne very meekly promising to
obey his wife, which was very just and
proper. After the ceremony Rev.
Gammons presented Mr. Towne a gold
headed cane and Mrs. Towne with a
gold headed umbrella, both of which
we're beautiful. Mrs. Towne carried a
handsome bouquet of yellow Narcissus.
When the presentations were finished,
all in the hall joined in singing "Silver
Threads Among the Gold." Mr. and
Mrs. Towne were then taiken to seats
at the head of the long, well filled table
whero they were presented a large
pyramid gold and white wedding cake
bearing the date of the wedding. The
colors of the table bouquets were white
sweet peas and yellow roses, which
were afterwards sent to the sick mem
bers of the two orders^ An automo
bile was hired by the W. R. C. ladies
to bring those that were too feeble to
walk. There were about 100 present,
including some of the relatives of Mr.
and Mrs. Towne. When the company
left for their homes each guest carried
apiece of the wedding cake as a souve
nir.

SIkmM Have No Opposition.
Elsewhere appears a call for a caucus
on next Wednesday evening to place in
nomination candidates for the various
city offices. Citizens generally are so
well satisfied with the present incumb
ents that, contrary to the usual situ
ation for several years, there is but
little talk concerning the municipal
election, and it is generally conceded
that Mayor Barker and his associates,
provided they will accept office for
another term, are entitled to and will
be given nomination and election with
out opposition.

Pruning and Spraying Demonstration.
There will beheld in Mr. A. E. Bents
orchard at Cresco, on Friday, March
17th commencing at 1:30 p. m., a prun
ing and spraying demonstration.
Iowa produces fruit of a maximum
quality when nature is assisted by three
fundamental principles of orchard man
agement, namely pruning, spraying,
and cultivation.
Many farmers would be willing to
prune their orchards if they knew how
and when the work should be ([done.
Perhaps the average orchard in Jjlowa
is neglected more than any other one
thing connected with the farm. Ev
ery farm in Iowa should have a good,
well cared for home orchard on it.
Tell your friends and neighbors about
the pruning and spraying demonstra
tion. An apple tree selected by those
present will be pruned and reasons*giv
en for making such and such cuts. The
time of year for pruning willjbe given.
Every phase pertaining toforchard tree
pruning will be discussed.
The subject of spraying will be dis
cussed and demonstrated as" far as
equipment at hand will permit. QThis
phase of orchard management is in
itself perhaps the most important sub
ject pertaining to orchard management.
The important insect orchard pests and
diseases of this locality- will be dis
cussed and also the best sprays] for the
control of these.
The school children, especially the
high school students, are especially in
vited to attend this meeting. The cost
for the meeting will be very small and
the traveling expenses will be pro-ra
ted with other places.
