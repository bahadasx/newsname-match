BY THE PRESIDENT
OR TAKE VILLA A
Decision Reached Alter Cabinet Meeting <
and Secretary Baker Rushes
Necessary Instructions.
White House Makes It Plain That Punitive
Expedition and Not Intervention
Is Intended.
;
President Wilson today ordered Amer- j
ican troops over the Mexican border to
capture or kill the Villa bandits who yesterday
raided Columbus, N. M.
It was said at the White House that the ;
!
American government wants Villa dead or '
alive, and that no steps will be neglected j
to carry out that object. j1
In its present stage ihe President's order does not mean armed j (
intervention in Mexico. It provides for a punitive expedition to' (
deal with lawless forces over which the Carranza government has ;
no control.
Maj. Gen. Scott, chief of staff of the army, announced that the j (
expedition would consist of not less than 5,000 men, all of which I c
are available on the border under Maj. Gen. Funston.
FLEET MAY BE SENT SOUTH. j.
, No orders had been issued to the navy this afternoon, but it was *
considered probable that some of the Atlantic fleet might be placed <j
in Mexican waters to be near if Americans in coast towns were en- j <i
dangered by anti-American demonstrations. The government is re- H
iuctant to make any naval demonstration that might be construed .
as against Gen. Carranza. jj
There is no expectation here that Villa and his band will be ap- f
prehended without hard fighting, and there is little hope that the ?
Carranza forces will get them if the American cavalrymen do not. ;
NOT CONSIDERED AN INVASION. I
It was declared that the United States will not consider the
punitive expedition an invasion of .Mexico and will continue to deal
with the Carranza government. The American government is still it
opposed to armed intervention in Mexico, but has decided that the ,L
peace of both Mexico and the United States is imperiled In the con- .'
tmued activities of Francisco Villa.
.... .... , fl
i he cabinet was unanimous in deciding that Villa must be|>
caught. .. |
The following statement was issued at tlie White House: j,i
"An adequate force will he sent at once in pursuit of Villa,'1
with the single object of capturing him and putting a stop to his
forays. jc
"This can he done and will he done in entirely friendly aid of the |
constituted authorities in Mexico and with scrupulous respect for ! J
i he sovereignty of that republic." ] t
t arran/.a authorities, according to official reports from luarez.
will not object to the entry of American troops into Mexico to attack
\ ilia Messages have been received at Columbus stating that Car-! ,
ran/a cavalry had leit btizman to attack the bandit chief in rear. *
with the expectation that American troops, whom tlu-v already supposed
had crossed the border, would attack him. t
!i
DETERMINED TO ELIMINATE VILLA
11
It was said that the pursuit of Villa will be undertaken in a com- J
prehensile way. and organized plans will be laid for his apprehension.
a
Officials received word of the decision to go after Villa with;
troops with undisguised satisfaction. Cabinet members expressed I
themselves a- great It pleased. Army officers voiced unanimous i
approval. \ general teeling of relief that the administration had j
ftnallv decided to take the step was apparent. I
'lite President himself is firmly convinced of the necessity of
eliminating \ ilia from the Mexican situation. He i-. represented as j
iust as determined to oust \ ilia as he was to oust \ ictoriano lluerta. P
IIh' announcement "I the intention of the President to send''
i (
troops into Mexico was accompanied by scenes not equaled since]
the determination at the White House to send the Atlantic Heet to I
A era Uru/. j i
TO NOTIFY CARRANZA IMMEDIATELY. I1
Pain- were taken by officials to point out their hope tliat < ien. ' (
C arran/a would realize the -pirit in which the American troops were I'
being sent after Villa. ,
t'arranza will he notified immediately that the United States !
has no intention of taking any Mexican territory whatever and respects
fully the sovereignty of that nation. i
American officials realize that f arranza mav have difficulty in <
consenting to the presence of American soldiers on Mexican soil be- j
cause of popular feeling in his country. C'arranza himself, however, ,
i- believed to be -o eager for. \ ilia s capture that he mav co-operate ]
with the American troops. '
\t the cabinet meeting the discussion of the situation was brief
and to the point. The cabinet unanimously agreed that the only
thing to do was to send troops. President Wilson took the same t
position and at once instructed Secretary Baker to issue the ncc- ,

Turk Collapse Expected.
The final collapse of the Turkish
campaign in the early spring is confidently
predicted by the Russian military
critics, who base their assertions
upon the remarkable progress the Russian
army is making along the Black
sea coast, and in Persia. The critics
find increasing evidence of demoralization
among the Turks, and inability to
continue their organized positions.
The past week has broUKht the northern

diate objectives. The recent victories iti
Persia will enable the Russians to push
forward over the mountain range,
hitherto considered impassable, to a
point within twenty-five miles of the
Mesopotamian border, while the troops
moving along the Biuck sea toast under
the protection of the Russian fleet
now are within a similar distance of
Trebizond.
The capture of Iliza leaves no important
coastal tlefen:. on the way to
Trebizond. and a combined land and
sea attack on Turkey's most important
Black sea port now is being prepared.
According to a!! reports, the Turks
ha\e done everything they could to improve

Russia is making preparations to
use the recently captured harbor of
Kiza as a naval base for the advance
on Trebizond. from which it is thirtyfive
miles distant. Riza is an idea*
harbor for the purpose and offers ample
shelter and anchorage. In this
way the Russians will have the advantage
of satisfactory communications
by sea. by which the Turks are handicapped
by incredibly bad land communications.

Situation Regarded Better.
j The situation at Verdun is regarded
| as much better, from the.French viewpoint.
as a result of yesterday's flght'

J reports of' successful resistance on th*
I part of tiie defenders of the fotticss
I' Notwithstatiding an enormous ?\p-i.d.
ture of ammunition ami unstinted sacrifice
of life, the Germans have faile.i
, to bend, much less break. th\ blue line.
The inference drawn by the genera!
j public in France is thai the German
; wave has advanced as far- as is ip it:
i power without further wastage on
large scale, which the Gentian general
I staff hesitates to make, w ith four arm*
| corps already put our of action in 'lie
struggle of eighteen days.
! (Exhausted by thrge days of violent
1 efforts, the assailants called a half rest
j to replenish the depleted ranks of in

| the respite to sweep out the Germans
jstil! remaining in Corbenux wood, and
(in this effort were almost smvessfu.
Interest Centers in Douaumoilt.
j The renewal of heavy fighting cast of
the Meuse attended by a series o' asisaults
on houauniout has cetitered interest
once more on this portion of the
! front.
: A good road runs through tlie gently
1 sloping ravine up ttlie plateau before
J Douaumont. possession of which would
(enable tlie attacking forces lo take the
j defenses in the flank.
I Massed infantry, well supported by
(artillery, struggled hard to win com
pnand of this easiest approach io the
famous position, but the French w
aide to hold off the assailants and a'
the same time to deal with attacks
from the village of Douaumont.
In the Woevre tlie Germans did nor
attempt to pursue their actions further.
German System of Attack.
I The great successes in battles up to
I the present nave ueeu gamcu i?>
means of violent shocks delivered b>
fresh and specially prepared masses of
infantry, and have generally been
achieved rapidly. Of such a character
was the German attack on Verdun
| which smashed itself against the
' French defenses on February 26.
i The Germans then began a series of
battles on small fronts, sometimes a'
one point, sometimes at another. One
day the attack was made on the extreme
left from Bethincourt to Goose
hill, on another day* a blow was struck
at the extreme right, at Kresnes. and
again at Douaumont. All these were
genuine attacks, carried out b\ masses
of troops capable of undertaking serious
actions.
Assaults Prove Mystifying.
Military observers are at a loss to
explain the object of these assaults, as
it is believed there is little probability
that they will have grave consequences
for the defenders.
The important question is whether
things will go on this way, just as m
the case of the French offensive in the
Artois region, which, beginning Ma> <*
of last year, continued with diminishing
force far into J tine, or whether there will
be another great attack, carried out b>
the most powerful means and with that
singleness of aim which decides tli*? vie
lory. Not often in the iong battle have
the French infantrymen had the order
to advance. When they diet receive it
they showed that their offensive spirit
had lost nothing by being held in They
had such opportunities on Wednesda.v
and Thursday in Corbeaux wood On
