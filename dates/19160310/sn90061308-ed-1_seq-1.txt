GERMANY DEFINES f
NEW POSITION ON
U-BOAT WARFARE
Concedes in Memorandum Internation
al Law Does Not Regulate Use
of Submarines
. Washington, March 8. Germany
today made a further explanation to
the United States of the position it
has taken in regard to armed mer
chant vessels of the entente allies.
Count von Bernstorff handed Secre
tary Lansing a formal' memorandum,
which, after reviewing the events
leading up to Germany's recent deci
sion to treat armed merchant ships as
auxiliary cruisers, conceded that ex
isting international law does not reg
ulate the use of submarines, indicted
a willingness to conduct undersea war
fare in accordance with the law pre
vailing at the outbreak of ' the war
providing Great Britain and her allies
would regard the same laws,, and ex
pressed the hope that the people of the
United States, remembering the long
existing friendly relations between the
two nations, would appreciate the Ger
man position.
The memorandum was submitted to
President Wilson shortly after the re
ceipt. It will be considered, together
with other documents from the Ger
man government, in determining what
shall be the next step of ihe United
States in the submarine negotiations.
There' was every7 indication that the
administration would be in no hurry
to announce a stand as to the new pol
icy of the central powers, or to pass
finally upon Germany's latest proposal
for a settlement of the Lusitania case;
Echoes of President Wilson's victory
in the fight to end agitation in con
gress over the armed ship question,
were heard today on both sides of the
capitol. In the senate, Senator Stone,
chairman of the foreign relations com
mittee, made a statement, after a con
ference with the president, announcing

STICKS
A long time ago an old man, who
didn't' expect to live many years,
called his six sons to him and said--
"My boys, I have here a bundle
of six sticks which I have tied to
gether. I want to see which of
you boys can break this bundle of
Sticks. John, you are the strong
est, suppose you try first."
John took the Bundle of Sticks.
He bent them across his knee. He
strained and pulled. In vain. .He
could not break the Bundle of
' Sticks. .,
Each of the sons tried to break
the Bundle of Sticks, without suc
cess.' They c'Ould not be broken.
Then said the old father
"Boys, NO one can break that
Bundles of Sticks so long as they
are all tied together. But ANY
one could break a single stick.
Just so long as you boys stick to
gether you are SAFE. When each
one goes on his own hook you are
NOT safe-any one can break you."

THE STORY OF A BUNDLE OF
BANKS
The NATIONAL Banks of this
country are very much like a Bun
dle of Sticks.
ALL National Banks are Mem
bers of the Federal Reserve System
of the United States Government.
The; are all tied together in this
vast system by the same law.
When you deposit your money in
Savings Department of a NATION
AL Bank you KNOW your money
is safe.
While NATIONAL Banks only
number about one-third of the
Banks in this country, they have,
about two-thirds of all the re
sources of all the Banks in the
United States.
A NATIONAL Bank cannot in
vest your money where you cannot
get it when you need it. It MUST
be able to pay every depositor in
full at ANY time. ' To secure
money a NATIONAL Bank can go
to the Federal Reserve Bank of
which it is a Member and redis
count its paper and secure CASH
for its depositors..
A NATIONAL Bank is one of a
Bundle of Banks bound together by
the Laws of the United States
Government.

London, March 8. Fighting of
great violence between the French and
German infantry has been in progress
from Bethancourt, northwest of Ver
dun, to the Meuse and east of the
Meuse from the southern slopes of the
Cote le Talos to the Douaumont re
gion battle fronts aggregating about
ten miles in length. Spirited artillery
duels continue along the remainder of
the front about Verdun .
A continuation of the German drive
northwest of Verdun is declared by
Berlin to have netted the Germans
French positions over a front of nearly
four miles and virtually two miles in
depth, and enabled them to capture
fifty-eight officers and 3,277 men. The
villages of Forges and Regneville, the
heights of Rebenadt Cumieres woods
fell into the hands of the Germans . '
The French did not give up these
positions without strong resistance
and suffered heavy casualties, espe
cially along the southern fringe of the
Cumieres wood.
