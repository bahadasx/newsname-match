RALLY FOR NEW CADET
CORPS WASJNTH0SIA5TIC
The N. A. N. S. boys "rally" in the
interest of a new cadet corps at the
Normal last 'Friday evening at the
Emerson school hall met with an en
thusiastic response from the people
and the hall was filled with their
friends to encourage them in their
work.
The most excellent Nqrmal orches
tra under the direction of Miss Lus
comb volunteered their services and
rendered patriotic music which pleased
the patriotic gathering.
Postmaster Byrnes made a rousing
appeal to patriotism in his opening
address which seemed to touch the
right spot with his audience and was
filled with encouragement to the
"young men interested in the organiza
tion of the cadet corps.
Following "America" by the au
dience standing, Forest Supervisor
John D. Guthrie gave a thoughtful
talk on preparedness.
The mixed quartette, Misses Lus
comb and Mctcalf and Messrs. Rosen
berry and Johnston voiced their pa
triotic sentiments in music that stirred
the hearts of hearers.
Adjutant General Harris of the

for an expression 01 opinion and
volunteered the information that the
national guard would giauiy proviae i
a competent instructor for the new '
cadet corps if it was organized, and !
do all in their power to assist it as
was being done at the Tempe Normal
and University at Tucson.
Representative Will Marlar pre
sented the legislative difficulties in
securing necessary funds for the
Normal school because of the scarcity
of northern representatives and was
followed by a short talk by ex-Col.

a talk straight to the point, one that
pointed out the reasons why the
organization should be, and gave a
graphic personal experience incident
supporting the preparedness idea.
Dr. Hambly, of the Federated 1
church, thrilled his audience with an'
address on patriotism and strenuously
advocated America for Americans,!
born or naturalized. ,
The "rally" closed with the "Star j
Spangled Banner" by the audience.
A great majority signed the peti-
tion to the Normal board asking that
military training be made a part of
the school work or at least permitting
the organization of the cadet corps.
Capt. John Matthews and Lieut
Masters who .brought about the meet
ing are entitled to credit for their
hustling ability and enthusiasm. Re
gardless of what may or what may
have been said, criticism should
not detract from an enthusiastic en
couragement of the young men at the
Normal. They made a remarkable
showing and if they keep up their
present energetic work there will be
a fine body of young men in the ncw
cadet corps.
Will Fill Crater Lake With Water
The Coconino' Water Development
& Stock Co., under the direction of C.
H. Spencer, has commenced active
operations of water development at
Crater Lake, northwest of Flagstaff.
A tunnel is being driven into Crater
Lake andit is proposed to fill it with
water. This is only one of the many
water development schemes they have
on hand for this summer as they have
water locations all the way around the
mountain they propose developing.
Opie Read Lecture
A treat is in store for the people of
Flagstaff in the coming of Opie Read,
famous lecturer, author, novelist, and
story teller, who appears at the Emer
son hall, Monday evening, March 13,
at 8:15 p. m.
Mr Read is one of the most expe
rienced lecturers on the Lyceum plat
form today, and as a delineator of the
Southern dialect, he has no equal. His
character "Old Lim Jucklin" in his
book "The Juckllns" is a character
that will live and grow in the hearts
of American people as time goes on.
Read tells, on the average, a story
every three minutes, fresh and origin
al from his own brain. These stories
have never been published, and will
not be, during the life of the author.

INDIANS ARE PEACEFUL
SAYS SUPERINTENDENT
Twenty-six horse Indian teams were
loaded with government freight here
Wednesday under the supervision of
Supt. Walter Runke, and headed for
Tuba. The freight had been delayed
during the past month by storms.
Supt Runke says the roads are now
in good shape for wagons and autos
all the way, from Flagstaff to Tuba
except a few small bad places between
here and Cliffs.
Speaking of the recent Indian dis
turbance at Tuba, Mr. Runke says
that while of course there never was
any danger of an uprising of the In
dians, the particular bunch of, Indians
who caused the trouble were bad and
they might have secured enough sym
pathizers to have caused a consider
able trouble for the white people at
Tuba locally, but there was no cause
for fear generally. Many of the In
dians arc glad that Taddy Tin is no
more, including immediate members
of his family. The particular band
that Taddy Tin had gathered together
were bad and placating them may only
postpone trouble with them, not that
he fears anything serious, but like
unruly children, when they have

The final pow-wow had taken place
when the federal otllcials reached '
there and he was convinced that that j
particular trouDicnad oeen settled, j
though there was and is a necessity .
for a thorough understanding with '
that select bunch of Indians.
Says Report Was Much Exaggerated
Leo Crane, superintendent of the
Moqui Agency at Keams Canyon,
writes the editor of the Gallup News
as follows, anent his being killed by
Indians:
"With all due respect to the press
notices of February 19 and later, in
your paper and elsewhere, 1 beg to

LOS ANGELS FINANCIERS
MAY BUY TUSYAN MINE
C. W. Dawson returned Thursday
morning from Los Angeles accom-
panied by a Mr. Green who represents
a body of monied men interested in
mining. They left immediately for
the Tusyan mining company's proper-
, ty in the Grand Canyon about fifteen
miles northeast of Grandview. The
property is owned principally by
George McCormick, Fred Hensing,
Francis Crable and C. D. Dawson.
If the property pleases Mr. Green it
is probable that the Los Angeles
financiers will take over a controlling
interest and commence development
work there this spring.
From all accounts there is a great
body of good ore in sight and the
property is a valuable one.
Schubert Symphony Club Great
The Schubert Symphony club enter
tainment Monday evening given under
the auspices of the Elks at the Em

musical treats of the season. The
theatre was packed and enccores were
too numerous to be complied with.
They would be welcome back again
any time.

FLAGSTAFF TO EXPERIENCE BIGGEST
BOOM IN HISTORY THIS SPRING
Plans Made for Three New Opera Houses, NewPost-
office, New Masonic Building and
New Armory
Flagstaff is promised the greatest
building boom in its history the com
ing year. Among the new big build

stories covering the same space of the
old building to cost in the neighbor
hood of $20,000.
The Elks have been making a stren
uous campaign for funds to build fi
substantial home on the lots owned
by them on the corner of Aspen ave
nue and Beaver street. They intend
erecting a building for an Elks club
that will cost at least $20,000 and now
have nearly $10,000 cash
raised for that purpose.

JOHN GOING CAUGHT
WITH STOLEN HORSES
John Goings, who worked for a
short time at the Greenlaw log
ging camp, departed suddenly
Saturday from the camp with his
wife, both using horses taken
from the Greenlaw company's
barns. The saddles were com
mandeered from the Dunnock
ranch and barn. The equipment
for the stampeed had been pre
viously gathered up with the
.5. purpose of makjng a rapid get
v away with the animals during
the night. ,
The horses were not missed
until the next morning when a
search was made and it was dis-
covered that Goings and his wife
were also missing, including the
discovery of missing saddles
from the ranch and barn.
The pair started east toward
2 Indian reservation and were
making their way east as fast as
possible when they were caught
Tuebday afternoon by Sheriff
Dickinson east of Holbrook and
: brought back to Flagstaff to an-
swer to the charge of horse
2 stealing. ;
5 Goings is a half breed Okla-
homa Indian who came into the
'camp last January with one
horse. His wife was riding and
he was walking. Nothing much
is known of them locally.
Goings pled guilty on the
charge of stealing the horses and
will be sentenced on March 20th
for his crime. Going says his !
wife was not guilty, as an acces-
v sory. He had told her that he
had bought the horses on time.
The chase was an exciting one
'Wr the time. They kept well off
the road and swam the horses
across two canyons in attempting
to make their escape. Sheriff
Dickinson followed them with v
the county automobile and cut the
country for their trail after get-
ting into the open country. The 4
big, heavily shod logging horses' !
! trail was easy to pick up in the
soft country.
J. C. "Kidd" Drum, formerly cap
tain of the Williams-Flagstaff short
run, was in Flagstaff Sunday visiting
old friends a few hours. He is now a

sweat of his irrigation ditches and

the building, the remainder to be
given over to the opera house. Albert
C. Martin, the Los Angeles architect
has made tentative plans for the
building patterned after the latest
epera houses in Los -Angeles and a
house that will comply with all the
protective ordinances of that city, in-
i-iuuing an asbestos drop curtain.
It will be an inclined floor, with re
gulation opera chairs, a balcony
and twelve loges. The stage will
be large enough to stage any
ordinary production, with a width of
thirty feet and twenty feet deep.
Dressing rooms will be below the
stage. J. J. Costigan, who will have
the management of the house is con
fident that it will be one of the most
complete, comfortable and up to date
of the smaller opera houses in the
southwest. The present intentions are
to rush the building along and have
it ready for a grand opening by July
1st next.
The Weatherford Opera House
The new Weatherford opera house
will be C0x75 feet, two stories high,
located on the site of the old building.
The first floor will be 22 feet in height
to givo room for balconies and boxes
01 the regulation character. The seat
ing capacity of the house will be
about 750. The main entrance will be
in the center of the building with a
good sized lobby and stairways lead
ing from either side to the balconies
and second floor of the building.
The second floor will probably be
fitted up and used as a hall for lodge
and other purposes.
The building will be built of brick
and stone and Mr. Weatherford has '
figured on having the building com
pleted and ready for use by July 1st.
Work of clearing away the wreckage
of the old building was commenced
this week.

GOVERNMENT LOOKING
FOR P. O. SITE IN FLAG
Postmaster Byrnes has re-
ceived instructions from the
postoflice department to send in
a list of available postoflice sites
that might possibly be secured in v
Flagstaff for a new government
building. The postoflice has out-
grown its present quarters and
must of necessity have more
commodious quarters within a
short time.
According to recent figures
the Flagstaff postofilce is paying
1 the government a net revenue of
over $9,000 per year, a sum that
' within 10 years, even under pre-
' sent conditions would provide a
handsome public building. A ;
' private enterprise doing as well
as this would have had plans un-
der way long ago for bigger and
better quarters, but since in-
1 fluence only counts, the people in
this sparcely settled state can
take what they get.

NEW ARMY BILL WILL
FEDERALIZE GUARD
Washington, D. C, March 4 The
army bill introduced in the senate
proposes the most thorough measure
for military preparedness ever pre
sented to congress in peace times. The
first defense bill was completed and
introduced.
The Army bill introduced in the
senate is to provide peace strength to
the regular army of 178,000.
The bill also provides for federal
izing the national guard with a peace
strength of 217,000. It creates a fed
eral volunteer army comparable to
the continental army proposed by Gar
rison; it will provide adequate reserve
systems of regulars and guardsmen
with short enlistments; it will create
reserve engineers, doctors, mechanics
and other civilian supporters of the
fighting troops.
Small Fire Sunday
A small blaze occurred Sunday
afternoon at J. W. Franklin's resi
dence on the south side, but was
promptly extinguished before much
damage was done.
The fire originated from an over
heated can of varnish put on the stove
to warm up and which was forgotten
for a few moments. The damage was
not great but caused considerable ex
citement for Mr. Franklin temporarily.
GOVERNOR HUNT VISITS
FLAGSTAFFJNB NQRMAL
Governor George W. P. Hunt, ac
companied by Judge Frank J. Duffy
and T. F. Nichols of the state en
gineer's staff, were in Flagstaff Wed
nesday. Governor Hunt had been in
to Apache and Navajo counties visit
ing the state dry farm stations and
stopped of here to examine into the
Normal building situation, with en
gineer Nicholson as expert to investi
gate the buildings and material.
When questioned as to his avowed
intentions as to the nomination for
governor on the democratic ticket,
refused to deny the tender empeach
ment that in the course of human
events it was not only possible but
very probable that he would endeavor
to secure a re-nomination and elec
tion to that office, regardless of the
fact that others might have designs
and ultrior motives to the same
effect and purpose.
Not mentioning any names, he was
confident that the mining interest of
the state would .have a candidate in
the field with the purpose of saving
the state.

LIVELY MQNIHLY MEETING
HELD RYJOARD OF'TRIOE
At the initial meeting of the year,
Wednesday night, the Flagstaff Board
of Trade came alive and demonstrated
what it could accomplish in an even
ing. The first proposition taken up and
one that evoked much interest was
the possibility of securing a military
post near Flagstaff. Many good rea
sons were advanced why such an in
stitution would fit in with the scheme
of things in this locality, and a com
mittee was appointed to deal first
hand with the subject.
Forest Supervisor Guthrie spoke on
the long talked of fish hatchery for
Oak Creek, showing how a little work
by the citizens of Flagstaff would
most certainly land that much desired
industry somewhere in the waters of
upper Oak Creek. Instructions were
given to take up correspondence with
the state game warden and others
having the project in charge.
The Hornaday plan for game re
fuges, now before congress, was also
championed by Mr. Guthrie as a
measure insuring the greatest public
benefit The Board enthusiastically
endorsed the measure and instructed
the secretary to express this action
to Arizona's representatives in con
gress. Last winter the Board of Trade
made an effort to have reserved for
general use purposes, such as camp
ing, etc, the finaly wooded section 6,
lying south of Flagstaff, and again a
trailer was sent out to get a line on
the proposition. It is very desirable
that the timber on this section be pre-
served for the town,
Another question of timber preser
vation was raised and Mr. Guthrie in
formed the board that the Forest
Service had taken care that no timber
be cut within 100 feet of any public
highway, when the timber had been
sold.
For some time the town council has
been trying to secure a certain section
0f government land, which comprises
part of the water shed of the city
water supply, lying just above the
present reservoir site. It developed
that, although the land could be
bought for $1.25 per acre, a long time
