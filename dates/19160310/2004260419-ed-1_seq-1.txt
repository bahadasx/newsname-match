LOCAL MAN INVENTOR
N. II. Kinney has per foe tod an ar
rangement which gives promise of
being very profitable to him. He has
already appid for a patent. The
article 1b a ball bearing lever and rod
to connect on twin engines or shot
gun feeds which control the valves
on log carriages. Mr. Kinney's long
experience In saw mills gave him the
idea and he Is certain he has a useful
appliance which will Increase the
output of a mill. This has been In
dlcated by letters he has received
from the several large mills, who are
giving the lever a trial. With the
apparent success of the Invention and
many mills resuming operations, It
seems that Mr. Kinney ft as a good
thing In sight.
WILL CELEBRATE
The Flremon, at their Inst regular
meeting, decided to celebrate the
Fourth of July, and have already
taken steps to initiate the movement
This organization is composed of
live wires and they will give us one
of the greatest celebrations held in
this city for years. There Is nothing
like taking tho bull by tho horns.
The eagle will sail pretty high in St
Helens that day.
NEW BOOKS ADDED
TO CITY LIBRARY
Donation of Fifty llooks by the IjiUj
Mih. FuniHwortli
Our library your library do you
realize It is your library? There has
been un erroneous Idea afloat that it
was the Woman's Club library. The
club certulnly has tho distinction of
organizing the same, but it Is for the
benefit of the general public.
Tliero are at present nearly 200
books in the library. Sixty of these
are loaned by the state library oth
ers are loaned by friends ot the li
brary and several have bceu donated.
An averago of ninety are out at a
time. The club has purchased about
20 books of tho later Action, which
aro rented at Gc per week. The
money from those Is used to buy
still more books.
There are being added some of
Stevenson's works and also tho Harv
ard Classics Junior library, as well
as soma of Hiley's poems. These
books are free, ao it is such books
we wish to got into the homes.
The library has Just been peresent
ed about SO books from the library
of the lute Mrs. Farnsworth. These
includo George Eliot's works. Coop
er's and sevoral other good authors.
These will soon be placed In the li
brary, making 250 books.
E. A. Robs has very kindly loaned
a place for the library and we are all
much indebted to him, but the li
brary has almost outgrown its quar
ters and now comes the question,
what can be done toward a perma
nent public library. Has any one a
solution, or will some ot the public
spirited citizens help to make this
possible? As soon as a place is pro
vided the library will be turned over
to the city and I am sure the interest
of the club will not flag in the mat
ter of getting books for the same.
NEW STEAMER
City ot St. Helens probably will
be tho name chosen for the second
McCormick steamer under construc
tion at the St. Helens shipyards, ac
cording to J. H. Price, manager of
the shipbuilding company, who was
In Portland this morning. Her keel
has been laid and the framework Is
well along. She will have capacity
for handling 2,100,000 feet of lum
ber, 100,000 feet more that the City
of Portland, nearing completion at
tho same yards and which will be
ready to launch in about three weeks.
Walter Wrlghtson, of Mobile, Ala.,
who Is having a lumber carrier built
at the same yards for service out of
Mobile for ports in the West Indies,
accompanied Mr. Price to the city.
Mr. Wrlghtson has been down to St.
Helens to see how the work is pro
gressing on his vessol. She is to be
a three-masted schooner, equipped
with auxiliary power, and will be
capable ot handling 600,000 feet of
lumber at a trip. Sho will be 166
foet long, 35 foot In the beam and
13 foet depth of hold. Her con
struction has been under way for the
last two monthB. In three months
more she is expected to ready to
leave for Mobile.
Announcement Is made that Cap
tain Johnson, now on the steamer
Klamath, will be master ot tho City
of Portland. Saturday Telegram.
SAFETY FIRST
The question ot regulating moving
picture theatres has been brought
up several times in St. Helens, but
to date nothing has been done other
wise, than providing license foes for
the operation of shows.
Places of public gathering, such as
theatres, should be regulated for tho
protection of the public, the women
and children who attend and also for
the property owners as well. Prac
tically every city ot any Blze has
codes or ordinances covering places
of public gathering and St. Helens
should not be backward in enacting
such regulations.
The Beating arrangements, the
cislcs, tho exits, should be considered
as well as the building itself. Build
ings in which theatres are operated
and adjoining buildings should bo
covered by regulations.
This is tho period of "Safety
First," and this Bhould be applied
before a calamity does occur.
WILL INSTALL
AN ICE PLANT
St. Helens C'o-0erative Creamery
to Manufacture Ice and Ire Cream
The stockholders of the St. Helens
Co-Operative Creamery Association
met in the office of the creamery
Saturday. There were about 40
members present.
The matter of installing a plant for
the manufacture of Ice and Ice cream
was the principal question under
consideration. It was decided to in
stall such a plant and the directors
were authorized to proceed with the
enterprise.
The summary of the business tran
sacted was very satisfactory, showing
a surplus of about $300.00.
The .stockholders expressed their
appreciation for the loyal support of
the home merchants.
This creamery Is still in its in
fancy but the number of patrons Is
Increasing every week. The creamery
buys at the market price, so every
dairyman gets full value for every
delivery.
This creamery is a member of the
Portland dairy exchange for the sale
of the product of the different co
operative creameries of the state,
which will Insure a ready market
for the surplus.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTES
Lester Wellington spent tho week
end In Portland visiting friends and
relatives.
A good timo was enjoyed by all
who attended the girlc' literary so
ciety last Friday evening. Invites
wero Issued to each member ot the
boys' literary society and the "taffy
pull" after tho program was the
drawing card of the evening.
Raymond Deavers was visiting
friends in Kelso last week end.
The regular student body meeting
was held Monday and It was moved
that the student body award letters
to the boys playing bnskotball. Those
entitled to letters are the following J
Lester Wellington, Raymond Deavers,
Dale Perry, Roy Laws, Walter Zy-.
sett and Ray Brouse.
This seems to be test week with
most students. That accounts for the
distorted countenances.
Ray Brouse, a sophomore, has left
us, having gone to St. Johns. This
takes a good athlete from our track
squad.
Spelling is gradually being reduced
to a scientific basis. There were ten
perfect manuscripts this morning.
This beats Dr. Meyer's tost.
It has been resolved that the Uni
ted States should forfeit all claims to
tho Philippine Islands. Seems like
congres has approved of this resolu
tion. EXPRESS OFFICE HERE
St. Helens Is to have an express
office located right down town, which
will be ot great convenience to the
public. The American Express com
pany has oponed an office here and
Franjc Wilklns will be agent, con
ducting the business from his present
office on the Sheldon dock.
SECOND COUNT IN
THE PIANO CONTEST
lidader Show Increased Gain Any
body's Piano Yet
The ballot box in the piano contest
was opened for the last time before
the final count and the standing of
each contestant are published for the
last time, showing Just how much
need be done for tho last lap of in
the exciting race.
Miss Marie Dixon increased her
lead and now has a good margin,
with Miss Neona Chittlm holding
second place and Miss Elsie Kallberg,
third. Both Miss Kallberg and Miss
Irene Cooley are being supported and
must bo recognized as prospective
piano winners with the rest. It has
been intimated that voting would in
dicate that sonio of the contestants
are holding up reservo votes and will
poll these at the last, but this Is not
a fact.
The ballot box is again closed for
the last count and with fairness to
all wo wish to instruct all voters that
it is optional how the subscribers are
turned in. Any one may bring the
namo to the editor and receive the
tickets, or it is the privilege ot the
voter to deposit the names of the
subecribers with the money in the
ballot box and when this is opened
by the Judges, the proper vote will
then and there be credited to the
party mentioned within. This insures
absolute secrecy and is fair to all.
Our further advice is to plan your
campaign well and let no one know
what you are about.
The standing Is as follows, and is
a correct list up to the present time:
Marie Dixon, St. Helens 57,800
Neona Chittlm, St. Helens. . . .34,350
Inez Cooley, St. Helens 17,275
Elsie Kallberg, Warren .16,175

F. OBter, H. O. Strom and P. I.

But this shall not be construed to
