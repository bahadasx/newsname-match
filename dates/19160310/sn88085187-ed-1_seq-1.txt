President Wilson, Aroused, Today Is Sending
MOO TROOPS TO MEXICO
What Is Likely to Happen—
VILLA'S STAR
DUE TO SET
Francisco Villa is by far tlie most remarkable pub-
He figure developed by the Mexican retell of terror,
His rise from peonage to the leadership of a fully
equipped uny ol 27,(MH) men was as rapid as bis tall.
Only a few years ago be was a hunted bandit in
tbe mountains of Chihuahua.
At the height of bis career bo was tbe most power
ful military leader in Mexico, then a few months
later be was back again in the same mountains where
lie bad committed the crimes of bis youth.
Although Villa in hundreds of interviews has stat
ed that be was fighting for bis people, not the honor
of being president, tbe natives of Chihuahua smiled.
"Gold, pure gold," they said, "is all that Villa
ever will fight for."
In March, 1913, Villa joined tbe constitutionalist
revolution and took tbe field with the equipment of
a borrowed mule, a few sacks of flour, and nine'men.
His army grew until it was a fully equipped
force of 27,000 men, with artillery.
He drove the federal troops out of tbe northern
part of Mexico and was supporting the Carranza
cause in the north. Carranza, however, was selected
as president by* few sections of tbe republic.
This im;de Villa indignant and be turned against
Carranza, and for the last year has been fighting the
constitutionalists. He was successful for a time. He
ginning last winter, however, he was forced to re
treat from his positions in the northern center of
Mexico.
Then came the recognition of Carranza as the
de facto head of the Mexican government. Villa
is reported at that time to have threatened to kill
all Americans he could catch.
After the massacre of Americans at Santa Ysabel
Carranza proclaimed Villa, Gen. Lopez and Gen.
Castro outlaws and subject to instant death by any
captor.
Yesterday followed the Columbus, X. M., outrage.
Tomorrow —well, tomorrow perhaps tli4 scene pic
tured above will be enacted.

E. P. Kemmer, membership
chairman of the Commercial club,

the entrance of the club dining
