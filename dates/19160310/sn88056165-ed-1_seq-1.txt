NO MORE A
DRY TOWN
Cottonwood Went Wet Yes
terday When' Creek Took
New Course Down Main
Street.
The rapid melting of the snow
which fell the first of the week,
taking out with it considerable of
the old snow underneath, caused
Cottonwood creek to go on the
rampage yesterday afternoon and
the natural channel through town
was not able to carry away all of
the water which poured down
from Cottonwood Butte and the
adjacent hills. About the middle
of the afternoon the water broke
away from the original channel
near the old brewery and about
one-fourth of the volume came
pouring through town. The
Btréam took the south side of
Main street and the small torrent
potored down the gutter and over
the cement walks in front of the
Turner Drug Store until east of
the Hoene hardware store, where
it again took to the street and
washed down in a broad sheet
past the hotel and finally found
its way back to the creek channel
again. The stream was deep
enough to make necessary a raised
plank walk across the gutter and,
when the flood reached its high
est mark about 5:30 o'clock, the
water washed the fronts of the
buildings on that side of the
street. Owing to the frozen con
dition of the ground the water
did no damage but had the fresh
et occurred later in the season it
w&uld have washed out the street
t ) a depth of two or three feet.
The high water caused all
kinds of excitement and frequent
remarks were dropped about
Cottonwood no longer being a
dry town. A Grangeville livery
team, which brought over a load
of traveling men from the coun
ty seat town, drank its fill from
the water running down the
street while the men were being
put off at^the hotel.
The freshet yesterday was the
worst experienced here in years
and it is fortunate that no dam
age resulted from it. The stream
is down to normal again this
morning and no more trouble is
anticipated.
Charles Strickfaden
Joins Benedicts
Charles Strickfaden, a promi
nent young farmer of the Ferdi
nand section and a brother of
Mrs. J. A. Gaul of this city, was
married at high noon last Sunday
at Gonzaga college in Spokane to
Miss Aubra Belle Hill, of that
city. After a short visit in Spo
kane they will go to Gilbert, Ida
ho, for a visit with relatives and
will thèn come to their home on
thejàrm near Ferdinand.
The groom is the youngest son
of Mr. and Mrs. J. F. Strickfad
en, of Ferdinand, and is a young
man of fine character and ability
who is in every way worthy of
the lady of his choice. The
Chronicle extends sincere wishes
for a very happy wedded life.
Henry Dourhoff, who is em
ployed at the Convent southwest
of town, received a compound
fracture of the left forearm the
first of the week by being hit by
a pulley. He was assisting to
raise a horse when the pulley
broke loose from where it was
fastened in the roof of the build
ing and, in falling, struck the
young man across the arm with
the above result. Dr. Shinnick
wutfa called to reduce the fracture
and the patient will be all right I
a gain in due course of time. |
Another Fine Pioneer Gone
J. J. Schlee, a pioneer farmer
of the Uniontown section and
well known to many residents of
this part of Idaho, died at his
home in Clarkston at noon last
Thursday from injuries received
when he fell from the hay loft of
his barn to the concrete floor be
low two hours before. After the
fall he walked to the house but
became unconscious and soon died
from a fractured skull. The de
ceased was almost 66 years of
age and came to Uniontown in
1876. He resided there until a
few years ago, when he moved
to Clarkston, and was quite
wealthy, owning over 1500 acres
of choice Palouse soil besides
large land holdings at Clarkston.
He was a fine type of farmer and
citizen and numbered his friends
by thousands. The funeral was
held Saturday morning from the
residence, interment being made
in the Lewiston cemetery. The
deceased was a relative by mar
riage of George Killmar, of Wi
nona.

Vance Rooke Un
dergoes Operation
Vance Rooke, youngest son of
Mr. and Mrs. Will Rooke, was
taken seriously ill at his home
over on Snake river last week
and on Friday wa3 taken to Lew
iston on the boat by his mother.
On reaching the hospital his con
dition was pronounced serious
and demanding an immediate
operation. A telephone message
was sent to his father, who rode
out from across the river Satur
day and left for Lewiston on Sun
day morning's train. The patient
recovered nicely from the opera
tion and word received here Mon
day was to the effect that he
stood a good chance of recovery.
Vance had been operating a
pack train for the past several
weeks packing feed down from
the plains country to a band of
sheep on Snake river and had
evidently over worked, bringing
on a serious attack of appendi
citis. His many friends here
will be glad to know he is doing
so nicely.

Buys Horses For
Montana Farmers
to
I Hill, 2; A. C. Gentry,
| Gentry, 1; John Duclos, 2.
Henry Katterhagen, the Union
town stock buyer who has been
here for the past week buying up
horses for the Montana trade,
shipped out seventeen nice ani
mals to Spokane Wednesday
morning, the rest of the car being
made up with another bunch se
cured in the Ilo country. Mr.
Katterhagen bought the horses
for a Spokane dealer and the lat
ter will dispose of them to farm
ers in the homestead sections of
Montana where good light farm
horses, and especially good brood
mares, are in demand. While
the price paid was not large,
averaging $122 per head, the ani
mals secured were a fine bunch
and will undoubtedly be followed
by further shipments from this
section.
Mr. Katterhagen states that
the horse market is fairly quiet
and there is no demand whatever
for heavy stuff. Light horses for
the Montana farmer trade are in
fair demand but as soon as this
demand is supplied the market
will be dull again. France is the
only warring nation in the mark
et for horses and is not paying
over $135 for the best animals,
consequently the farmers cannot
look for fancy prices unless some
thing unforeseen occurs to create
a big demand
Mr. Katterhagen secured horses
from the following parties: C

$60,000 Loss Sustained
in Grangeville Fire
The fire which destroyed the
flour mill and E. S. Sweet barn
at Grangeville on Thursday
night of last week proved more
serious than at first reported, as
is shown by the following dis
patch:
Grangeville, March 3.—(Spe
cial to the Tribune. ) —The burn
ing of the prize livestock ait the
E. S. Sweet stables this morning
when the building was fired by
brands from the burning flour
mill, presented one of the most
pitiable spectacles possible to de
scribe. A total of 11 horses and
24 cattle, many registered prize
winners at the big stock shows
last winter, were destroyed in
the flames.
The stables were located fully
a quarter of a mile from the burn
ing mill and immediately after
the fire brands ignited the barns
the work of removing the animals
was attempted. All were cut
loose by Floyd Trueblood but they
rushed back into the burning
building after having been driven
to a place of safety. Some of the
cattle and a few of the horses
were so terrified that any efforts
to drive them from their stalls
were fruitless and with the wind
blowing a 50-mile gale the rescu
ers were soon driven from the
building.
It developed today that Mr.
Sweet carried no insurance and
his loss from the early morning
conflagration will amount to ap
proximately $20,000. It is esti
mated the cattle burned were
worth about $2,000, buildings
$2500, two registered brood mares
$2000, two. sweepstake stallions
$7500, two young registered stal
Big Increase in
Creamery Products
The creamery has begun to feel
the effects of the coming spring
and the increase of the output of
butter has been noticeable during
the month of February. Mr. Gib
bons, the local butter expert, in
forms us that the amount o£ but
ter turned out by the local cream
ery for the past week exceeds
that of the previous weeks during
the winter by about fifty pounds,
which makes the average about
seven hundred pounds each week.
He predicts that, with the coming
of warm weather this spring and
the resultant green feed for the
dairy herds, the output of the
plant will average twelve hundred
pounds each week. The period
during which the production of
milk is greatest is between the
months of April and October,
two months being deducted from
this period for the expected dry
weather.
In his estimation, the greatest
drawback in the way of dairy
progress in this section is the lack
of silos which are very necessary
to the proper operation of a mod
ern dairy in a country adapted
to the raising of wheat. Even
with the decreased production
dürftig the cold winter months,
the Kendrick creamery has paid
money on the investment; and,
with the enlarged herds which
are being planned, it will be one
of the best little industries in this
vicinity.—Kendrick Gazette.
If a creamery will pay in the
Kendrick country we cannot see
why one would not pay here and
believe this matter should receive
closer attention than has been
given it in the past.

Mr. Sweet is extensively en
gaged in farming and stock rais
ing and for several years has
given special attention to the
raising of purebred porses, cattle
and hogs. He has been promi
nently identified with the promo
tion of the Northwest Livestock
association's annual show and
sale and now is heading the as
sociation as president for the sec
ond term.
The loss sustained by the
Grangeville Roller mills was esti
mated today by the owners to be
about $30,000 and the insurance
carried amounts to $12,000. The
milling company is headed by W.
W. Brown, R. N. Walker and
Isaac Zehner and since the mill
was taken over by the new own
ers approximately $7000 had been
expended in new machinery. It
is stated the plant was one of the
most complete in the state and
its products were in demsnd in
all markets. The capacity of the
mill was 125 barrels of flour a
day.
The cause of the fire remains a
mystery. When discovered the
flames were sweeping through
the entire structure* which pre
vented the location of the origin
of the fire. Reports from ranch
houses several miles out in the
country are that firebrands were
carried through the air like shoot
ing stars and at a number of
places the ranch houses were
saved only through the persistent
efforts of the farmers and their
families.
Bougnt New Home in Montana
Anton Nuxoll and Steve Traut
man returned Sunday evening
from their trip to Montana and
while there the former purchased
200 acres of fine farm land with
in two miles of the town of St.
Ignatius, near the Flathead In
dian reservation, and a nice resi
dence property in that little city.
Mr. Nuxoll paid $47.50 an acre
for his farm land and feels well
pleased with his buy. He says
that the soil looks fine and the
climate seems to be all one could
desire, while pasture and wood
are easily secured from the for
est reserve near by, and hunting
and fishing are within easy reach.
Mr. Nuxoll says quite a bit of
his property was overlooked in
making up the list for his big
sale on March 14th but that ev
ery thing he has in the livestock
and machinery line, as well as
most of their household effects,
will be sold and they will leave
for their new home within a few
days after the sale.
Bought Some Fine Shorthorns
Henry Munstermann, a pros
perous farmer of the Gifford
country, purchased four fine
grade Shorthorn cows with young
calves from Riley Rice at this
place late last week and shipped
the animals to Reubens Tuesday,
from where they were driven to
his farm. Mr. Munstermann paid
$110 each for the cows anfl will
use them in his dairy herd. Mr.
Rice has some of the finest Short
horn stock in this part of Idaho,
having bred these animals from
registered sires for years, afid
has no trouble in disposing *of
animals from his herd at frequent
occasions.
