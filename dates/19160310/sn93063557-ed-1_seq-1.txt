STOCK SHOW NOTES.
If you don't believe that it pays to
raise shecp you ought to bave heard
Mr.F. It. Marshall talk. Anyhow he
convinced us.
As one farmer said "The poorest calf
here today would have been awarded
first prize three years ago," which goes
to sbow that the Addison County
farmers nre getting wise to raising
stock.
You can't fool G. Arthur Hell when it
comes to judging cattle.
Wo were very sorry that Mr. Rommel
was unable to be with us.

ing wiih rcnd, "To hoo whnt actlon tho
town will tnko concerning tho hcquoatH
of tho lnto Josoph llattoll in roferenco
to tho Innd givon tho town for piirkH,".

orty on Chlpman Ilill wiih in the grand
list iih 125 aere.s, valued at $11000. Tho
wood.s oiiHt of tho town includo nbout 95

providen for a fund of $9900 for. the cnro
of the parkn, to be under tho inannge
inont of Thomas K. Hoyco nnd anotber
trusteo to bo nunied bv tlio Probato
Court. I'resident Thomas sald ho be
lievod the devise wan a generoua one
and that thu pnrk would bo of grent
benellt to Ihu town in the futuro.
Willis N. Cady suggoHted it might bo
well to dlvido tho quoKtlon, sinco somo
might favor onu park and not tho other.
Judge Hutton intioduced a rcHolution
accepting hoth tracts and tho Uind for
their maintenance, uiider the conditions
of the will, and this was carried unani-
mniisly.
Tlio bouuust of $500 n year m lieii of
ta.xes on tho Iiattoll htock wiih refused.
I'resident Thomaa said that at tho time
tho will was jlrawn such property held
by an educAtional institution was not
subject to taxation, Imt that tho law
had been changed and the college was
now pnying taxes on income producing
property in the town, and was perfectly
willing to do so. IIo explaiucd that the
llattoll will provided that the block bc
keptinsured and ri-built if nccessary;
that it was now assessed at $7li,00() and
therffore yieldcd the town in taxes
mucli more than the bequest. IIo said
tliat under these circumstances ho did
not expect tho town to nccept the he
quost, and moved that it be refused,
which was carried unanimously.
Mr. E. Ii. Cornwall for the library
trustees said that tbere wasapossibility
that the town could sectire a $15,000
liurarv building from tbo Carnegio Cor
poration, jirovidcd a tax of four per
cent for library support was -voted.
This was done, with tho understandin '
that only the usual sum would be ox
pended unless a new building was se
cured. On the general question of tho
library, Judge Weeks spoke strongly,
testifying to the large nunibers who
used itand itsbenefittothecommunity.
There were several votes on the np
propriation for hand concerts, but at
last the moderator declarcd that $500
was voted, which seemed to b6 the will
of the majority.
One hundred dollars was voted for
Memorial Day, $G5 for the village and
$35 for East Middlebury.
On motion of II. L. Hunt, seconded
by W. N. Cady, $1000 wns appropriated
for permanent roads to tnko advantage
of the law granting State aid for high-
ways.
Tho plant of the Bryant Manufactur-
ing Company in East Middlebury was
exempt from taxation for a period of
five years. This plant was hurned re-
cently and the owners bave rebuilt,
desnito attractive olfers elsewhere.
There seemed to be no opposition to the
exemption. '
The question of a new bridge on
"Muddy Branch" near the Fullerl'ierce
place was left to tho selectmen, to do
as they thought best. i
It was voted to tako advantage of the
new law as to the eollection of poll
taxes, after Milo K. Moore hadexplain
cdthitit would permit of closer col-'
lections. On the other hand tho plan
of the last legislature forauniform sys
tem of town accounting was rojected.
A general town tax of 70 cents was '
voted. For the schools outsido of Dis
trict No. 1 a tax of 50 cents was levied
and for town highways .V) cents.
James B. Donoway was moderator of
the meeting nnd Josoph M. Burke clerk.
Beside Fred A. Brookins selectman, the
other ofiicers elected were Elroy Ses-
sions, school director for three years,
C. E. Seeley listor for three years. Wil
liam M. Jnckson ovcrscer of the poor.
His salary was made $100 as in previous
years. Charles E. Pinney was re-elect-ed
trustee of public money and treas
urer, and the former board of auditors,
consisting of George E. Marshall, Oscar
II. Cushman and Dr. W. II. Sheldon,
were re-elected. A. N. Brown was re
