Washington, D. C, Feb. 28, 1916.
Editor, The Tribune
Wauseon, Ohio.
My Dear Sir:
' Recent developments in Congress
indicate that the Democratic majority
are op in the air; are divided in pur
pose and not in accord with the Presi
dent on several propositions, especial
ly so as to our diplomatic relations
with other countries, and on Pre
paredness, togeuier . witn raising
views on the manner of raising
revenue. One prominent Democrat
in an interview recently stated that at
'.east ninety Democrats in he Lower
House opposed to the President's
manner and method of doing things
and his plans generally.
With the majority so hopelessly
divided, there ia little chance of
speedy action by the Congress in the
way of legislation looking toward im
provement in our defenses, or as it
Is called, better Preparedness. Mr
Bryan's influence is undoubtedly be
ing exerted to the limit in the pres
ent Congress, and it spells failure for
the President's preparedness plan un
less the Republicans go to his rescue,
and tney are going to be patriotic
enough to aid him so far as may be
necessary to give us a sale and sane
Increase in the Army and Navy, to
rather with ? the necessary improve
ment in our coast defense. The Chief
of the Coast Artillery savs in his
annual report: "We possess the most
formidable system of coast defense in
the world." All we need is men to
properly man them. We also need
more ammunition, more mines for bur
' harbors and more coast submarines
as well as fleet submarines. Our
Navy is excellent so far as it goes
It is fourth ' rate now. It shou'd be
doubled in many, of its branches to
civs us even a fair first line of de
fense in event of attack from either
the Atlantic or, Pacific side. We are
a rich prjxe for any strong, piratical
nation, and the past two years should
teacn us a lesson. Japan is prepar
ing and needs watching.
Nobody seems to favor a large
standing army. A moderate increase
In oar present regular army will go
through Congress. Everybody recog
nises the fact that steps should be
taken looking toward military train
ing ana we creating or a reserve
' force of some kind, possibly through
the State Militia. Forced military
service or training is not popular. It
must be free and voluntary. The
European method of creating and
maintaining armies can not be in
troduced or tolerated here.
The Republican minority are unit
ed aad ready and waiting to do busi
ness whenever the Democratic ma
jority, who are in absolute control of
all the committees, present their plans
so far at least, as the question of bet
ter preparedness is concerned.
The minority believe and insist
that the flag covers and should pro
tect every American citixen whether
at home or abroad, at any and all
times, whenever they may be entitled
to It, and that the whole power of
this government should be used to
that end on all occasions. This does
not mean war; It means respect. They
are for peace, but lor peace at any
price. It must be peace with honor.
If we are to take our place among
the nations of this world, and we ar
perforce obliged to do so or become a
dependent nation, we must at alt
times be in a position to command the
good will and respect of all peoples.
And there are many who believe the
present International School of Cor-
' respondence now being carried in and
developed by the present Adminis
tration is not tending to that end.
Fine phrases do not always produce
results. Mr. Cleveland's course with
England m the Venezuela incident
quickly produced results.
Industrial prepardness is one thing
the Republicans in Congress believe
to be of equal importance with an
increase in the Army and Navy. We
must have auch protection as will in
sure the Stability of all our indus
tries, manufacturing and agricul
tural, against any possible condition
flict now raging in Europe comes to
an end.
Existing International Law has been
the growth of Ages. Its develop
ment has been slow but sure, and is
the result of the experience of all
nations of the world as worked out
by the greatest statesmen of all
times, after mature deliberation in
years gone by in many international
congresses, conventions and diploma
tic gatherings. It is expressed, or re
presented by agreements, many ol
them verbal, which have erected long
standing precedents. Many more of
them in the shape of written treatie3
ratified and approved by the treaty
making powers ledged in each of the
governments of the world. All the
civilized governments are parties to
these agreements and treaties and
deeply interested in their preserva
tion. The present code of Interna
tional Law was brought into existence
long before the present world wide
war commenced and was intended to
meet the existing conditions in the
world today and protect the rights
and secure certain privileges to non-

It was as fine a looking lot of men
as could be found anywhere in the
btate or Uhio that was gathered in
the court room at Wauseon last Fri
day morning to listen to the mess
ages concerning the construction and
maintenance of the road of the coun
try. The audiece filled the court room
and the careful attention given the
speakers attested to the interest
taken in the important subject of good
roads.
Mr. C. O. Castle. County Surveyor
and alsoy under the new road law,
County Highway Superintendent was
the nrst speaker at the forenoon ses
sion; he gave a practical talk on the
provisions of the Road law and show
ed very clearly the necessity of co
operation between the township and
county officials in order to obtain the
most desirable results m road build
ing and maintenance. Mr. Castle's
address was direct to the point and
cleared the way for a more perfect
understanding of the next address on
the program which was given by Mr.
liinkie, JJeputy State Highway Com
missioner, who dwelt upon the pro
visions of the law especially as to
systematic maintenance of the highways.
This is a very important factor in
the problem of roads i and one to
which all to little attention has been
given in the past with the result that
thousands of dollars have been lost
to the citizens of the state not to
speak of the loss of labor and ma
terial jiut into the original construc
tion of roads, which the timely ex
penditure of a few hundreds of dol
lars might have saved. The citizens
of the State are beginning to realize
this false economy of the past and
one of the most valuable portions of
the Cass Codified Road law is that
which makes provision for road re
pair, and maintenance, y
Prosecuting Attorney Charles T.
Stahl followed with an address on the
road question from the legal point of
view which was well received. It was
very noticeable that very few left
the room during the progress of the
addresses, again testifying to the
real interest in the matter before
them. '
At the afternoon session Mr. RudV
sill representing the Ohio Good Roads
Federation gave the first address
which quite naturally dwelt upon the
lmnortance of good roads. Mr. Rudi
sill spoke in place of Hon. Jess E. Tay
lor, he president of the Ohio Good
Roads federation who was unab'e to
fill his engagement here on account
of severe illness. There was general
regret because of Mr. ,Taylor's sick
ness but Mr. Rudisill gave a very
interesting and instructive address.

nefcessarily required a considerable

out in practical application.

Straight Forward Statement From
Governor Willis Governments
Should Be Conducted on Business
Principles Keep Expenditures
Within The Limit of The Revenues.
In view of the fact that the Demo
cratic press bureau of the State is do
ing its utmost to hide from the peo
ple of Ohio, by misrepresentation and
the juggling of figures, the real truth
that the present State. administration
is carrying out its platform pledges
as to economy and efficiency; it is
good for citizens to read the follow
ing 1 straight foward statement ad
dress recently made at Waverly:
Governments have been busy tell
ing farmers and business men how
to run their affairs. It is time now
for merchants and farmers to insist
that governments shall be run upon
at least as good . business principles
a tnose wnicn tne wise mercnant uses
in the management of his business
and with as strict and careful econ
omy as a good farmer practices in
running his farm. No farmer would
hire men to work for him when he
did not need their services and simply
because the men wanted the place
nor wouia he -recKiessly increase
salaries far beyond the real worth of
the services rendered just because he
wanted to please somebody. Yet
in recent years this very thing has
been done by the government of the
State of Ohio, offices have been
created to take care of political par
ties and salaries have been increased
in order to pay political debts out of
the tax payers', money. This prac
tice, however,! came to an end more
than a year ago, salaries have not
been increased, but on the contrary
have been reduced. Useless offices
have been abolished and sinecures
have been wiped out of existence.
Tremendous savings have been
brought within a few short months
in several departments of the state
Government without in any way lm-
paring the efficiency of the public
service.
If every politcial subdivision of the
state will adopt and follow this slogan
of economy, fewer offices, lower sal
aries, less waste, there will be no
need for higher taxes. Instead of
seeking to raise more taxes to meet
expenditures in contemplation, let us
curtail expenditures so as to keep
them within the limit of the revenues
we now have. Instead of trying to
make taxes grow to meet expenditures
let us cut down expenses to meet rev

taught and practiced the highest ful
filment of life, the attainment of peace
and happiness and the development
of ; the noblest human character
by service and ministry for
the welfare, the ennobling, the peace

waste and loss ef mankind. Lent
furnishes an opportunity to consider
the way of Christ and to cive it a
trial. It was not for its own sake and
agrandizment that the ancient church
established this season of Lent, but
for the real and the highest good of
an to wnom the church was com
missioned to minister. And so it
and the same program of economy
and retrenchment should be adopted
by every political subdivision of the
state. Limitation on. the tax rate
must be preserved; I assure you there
will be no special session of the legis
lature to break down the one per
cent, tax law and increase the bur
den of the tax payers.
It is no easy thing to abolish
useless office when it once has been
established. After the campaign is

opponents is assured, some friend of
the incoming administration is pret

those who will put aside for a sea

the strife for gains that cannot be

personal desires and - fix their
thoughts upon the things that abide
and the things that are Eternal.
GRANGE FOR COUNTY AGENT
The granges of Lorain county have

last few months with the result that
the farmers in that country have con
cluded that a county agent should be
secured to aid them in becoming more

providing a. fund which will insure a
sufficient salary for a competent man

Trees To Plant.
Rural school houses as a rule are
not beautiful buildings. Neglect
rather than painstaking care is the .
rule for the average country school
yard. This should not be the case.
Arbor Day should mean much to the
rural school. It is the day when the
yard should be cleaned and planted
An elaborate program on Arbor Day
will not improve . the appearance of
your school yard unless the program
consists largely of exercises with the
shovel, rake and hoe. -
' We are often at a loss on Arbor Day
in regard to the varieties of. trees, to .
plant. At our own' school this was
the case and we consulted the State
Experiment Station at Wooster and
received advices of a very material
kind. Mr. Secrist the Forester not
only gave us advice but also all the
trees we wanted to plant. ' The only
cost to us being the cost of the ex
press. The trees we planted consist
ed of Norway Spruce for a wind- -
break on the West side of the yard.
White Pine for . the wind break on
the North side of the school yard,
(Jataipa Speciosa for the - East side
and an assortment of various hard
woods for the. South side of our
school grourids. Text books on for
estry advise us to avoid straight
lines in planting - trees but on a
small yard of an acre or less this can
not be. done without sacrificing con- j
siderable of the play ground.
Some persons criticise . the ever
green trees saying they give a place
a "grave yard" appearance but this
we think is only a fancied greivance
There is a stately beauty about the
pines and hemlocks especially in win
ter that surely adds a touch of cul
tured beauty and refinement to any
architectural or landscape plan.
The planting and care of these
trees means work and practice for
the agriculture class. It is a work
the larger boys and girls enjoy. They
are proud to help make their school

the risk of being called a base m-'
grate if he does not shake down the
plum, so ripe and ready to fall.
In spite of the hinderances and de
lays,, however, we are making pro
gress in economy and efficiency. An
effort to obscure this record may be
made but it cannot permanently suc
ceed. If a useless office is eliminat
ed, the salary discontinues and no
other position is created in its place,
that salary is saved. The fact is so
obvious that it cannot be explained
away. The policy of retrenchment
inaugurated by the state is already
making itself felt and will soon be

VICTORY FOR
WAUSEON ATTORNEY
Attorpey Fred B. Fowler has the
satisfaction of having won a hard
fought criminal case in the Henry
County Court of Common Pleas last
week. Mr. Fowler was the attorney
for Judson R. Linthicum, a member
of the Henry County Bar, who was
indicted on the charge of embezzle
ment made by B. W. Justice of Hoi
gate. '
The trial which began last Thurs
day revealed that Justice and Linthi
cum had had business transactions
since 1907, that Justice had borrowed
money from Linthicum and that he,
Justice, was indebted to Linthicum.
These transactions culminated on the
20th day of January 1915, when Jus
tice sent Linthicum $83.00 with which
to pay taxes; the taxes were $97.00
and Justice asked Linthicum to fur
nish the balance and Linthicum, at
first consenting to do so and later
concluding not to, kept the $83.00
which he credited to Justices' account
Justice admitting that he at this
time owed Linthicum from $250 to
$300. Justice later paid his taxes
himself and brought the charge of
embezzlement apainst Linthicum. The
trial lasted until Friday evening in
c'uding an evening session Thursdav.
The case was given to the jury Fri
day at 6:30 p. m. and on Saturday
at two p. m. they returned a verdict
of "not ruilty" and Linthicum was
disrharp-od. Attorney R. R. Cahill
prosecuted the case for the State.
Mr. Fowler is securing an enviable
'eputation for himsplf as a criminal
lawyer not only in this county but in
