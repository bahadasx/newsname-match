High School Notes
The track is getting in condi
tion for use again, tho yet some
what too moist.
There have been a few addi
tions to the 8th grade from the
country.
The play was set somewhat
ahead of expectation, hence no
paper advertisemen of the great
spectacle could be made.
Lord Bacon is coming in for a
considerable amount of discuss
ion by the seniors. Many hold
that he was in error in a lot he
set forth in his essays and others
feeling that the great writer
knew what he was writing
about
One of the seniors in English
holds that every child cost3 its.
parents a fortune. He does not
pose as a woman hater, bow-
ever.
Miss Helen Thrash, 2nd and
3rd grades teacher and several of
the senior class attended the
teachers meeting at Brunswick
last week.
"A Literacy Test for all Im
migrants" will be the subject of

to sustain President Wilson last
week and the House of Repre
sentatives by a vote of 276 to
143 Tuesday voted to stop all in
terference with diplomatic mat
ters which belong to the Presi
dent. It was apparent that all
felt that no condition would
arise which would result in Con
gress having to vote on the ques
tion of a declaration of war with
any nation.
England has ordered that guns
be not carried on liners and that
will of itself annul Germany's
threat to sink without warning
all such ships as carried guns, if
such ships belong to a nation
with which she was at war.

There was a one-day sitting by
Judge Lamb at Salisbury Tues
day to hear the case, Martha J.
Keck vs Cora and George Waters.
This case involved the question
of right to foreclose a deed of
trust which has been left in
escrow, two deeds of trust on
same property having been
after the one in escrow which

placed of record. Judgement
was for the plaintiff, allowing
the foreclosure of the first deed
of trust filed and the sum litigat
