for
Washington, March 10.
President Wilson today ordered
American troops over the Mexi
can border to capture or kill the
Villa bandits who yesterday raid
ed Columbus, N. M.
In its present stage the presi
dent's order does not mean arm
ed intervention in Mexico. It
provides for a punitive expedi
tion to deal with lawless forces
over which the Carranza govern
ment has no control.
The following statement was
issued at the White House:
"An adequate force will
be sent at once in pursuit of
Villa with the single object
of capturing him and put
ting a stop to his forays.
"This can be done and will
be done in entirely friendly
aid of the constituted auth
orities in Mexico and with
scrupulous respect for the
sovereignty of that repub
lic." rmtstnn Will Command.
As the members of the cabinet came
out
all expressed deep
sat isf action
with the decision reached at the cabi
net meeting.
As Secretary Lansing left the cabi
net meeting he indicated further rep
resentations probably giving notice of
the decision would be sent to the Car
ranza government immediately.
Major Scott, chief of staff of the
army, announced that the expedition
would consist of not less than 5,000
men. all of which are available on th
border under Major General Funston.
It was taid at the White House that j
the American government wants Villa j
dead or alive and that no steps wt!3
bfl neglected to carry out that object.
It was declared that the United
States will not consider the punitive
expedition an invasion of Mexico an
will continue to deal with the Car
ranza government. The American
government is still opposed to armed
intervention in Mexico, but has decid
ed that the peace of both Mexico and
the United Stat. is imperiled by th
continued activities of Francisco
Villa.
The cabinet was unanimous in de
ciding that Villa must be caught.
WmmI Mon Troops.
Klesio Arredondo. General Carranza
ambassador here, received the news of
the presidents decision with the state
ment that he could make no comment
and would at once notify General Car
ranza. Yesterday he declared it was
his opinion that such action would not
be resented.
General Scott said today that the
necessity of providing even a stronger
force for the border than it now has.
while the American troops are operat
ing in Mexico, would necessitate using
some troops now there for the pun
itive expedition. They probably will
be ordered from other posts. No plans
have been made so far as is known
for use of the national guard.
Officials PIOTd by Order.
It was said that the pursuit of Villa
will be undertaken in a comprehensive
'KANSAN SHALL
General Fred
way and organized plans will be laid
for his apprehension.
Officials received word of the de
cision to go after Villa with troops
with undisguised satisfaction. Cabinet
member? expressed themselves at
greatly pleased. Army officers voiced
unanimous approval. A general feel
ing of relief that the administration j
had finally decided to take the ste.
was apparent.
The president himself is firmly con
vinced of the necessity of eliminating !
Villa from the M xiean situation. Hl
is reprc-aented a? determined to on
ViJla, as he was to oust Victoriano
Huerta.
The announcecent of the intention i
of the president to send troops into
Mexico was accompanied by scenes not
equalled at the White House since the
declaration to send the Atlantic fleet
to Vera Cruz in 1914.
BTo Naval Demonstration.
No orders had been issued to the
navy this afternoon but it was con
sidered probable that some of the At
lantic fleet might be placed in Mexi
can waters to be near if Americans
in coat towns were endangered by
an ti -American demonstrations.
The government is reluctant to
make any naval demonstration that
might be construed as being against
General Carranza.
Pains were taken by officials to
point out their hope that General Car
rinza would realize the spirit in which
the American troops were being sent
after Villa.
Carranza will be notified imme
diately that the United States has no
intention of taking any Mexican ter
ritory and respects fully the sov
ereignty of that nation.
Carranza May Co-operate.
American officials realize that Car
! ranza may have difficulty in consent
j ing to the presence of American sol
. diers on Mexican soil because of popu
lar feeling in his country. Carranza.
. himself, however, is believed to be so
eager for Villa's capture that he may
j co-operate with the American troops.
At the cabinet meeting the discus
, sion of the situation was brief and to
i the point. The cabinet unanimously
j agreed that the only thing to d
to send troops.
was
President Wilson took the same po-
sition and at once instructed Secre
tary Baker to issue necessary orders.
He also instructed Secretary Lansing
to inform General Carranza of the
attitude of the American government
Leaders of both houses 01 congress
were immediately notified from the
White House of the president action.
They approved his course.
Sentiment in Congress.
Before deciding finally to send the
troops atter Villa, the president "con-j
ferreri over the telephone with Chair-
man Stone of the senate foreign rela-
tions committee who told him he be-
lieved the sentiment of congress would
solidly support his action.
I. was considered possible that w th-
in a few days President Wilson might
go before congress to recite the
series of acts by Villa which led up to
the ordering of troops to effect his
capture.
tne president desires to move .vitn 1
the entirv co-operation of congress.
"Hying Column" of 2.000.
The American invaders will consist
chiefly of infantry- There will be,
howevt r. at least a thousand to two
thousand cavalry- There will also be
at least one detachment of field ar
tillery and several batteries of moun
tain guns mounted on pack mules,
especially adapted for guerilla fight

A "flying column" of about 2,000
men, according to tentative plans of
hih army officials, will constitute the
probing force to which will be dele-
gaed the most active work .:f search-
ing out Villa.

at or near Columbus within twenty
four hours. From points west and

News of the return of the 50 Amer
ican calvarymen who pursued the ban
dits into Mexico without having killed
or captured Villa was received with
undisguised disappointment. The next
step of the Washington government
probably will depend upon nature of
General Funston s report
The troops had been sent across the
border by Colonel Slocum with orders
not to go more than two miles. His
action had the full support of the ad-
ministration and no orders had been
issued for the return of the men. The
question uppermost here today was
as to whether an adequate military
force would be sent across the border
for the further pursuit of the bandits
and the capture of their leader. Army
officers pointed out that a competent
force was distributed along the border
and that such an expedition could be
organized In a short time.
Don't Criticise Slocum
Although strict orders had been
given American army officers not to
cross the border with armed forces
there was no indication today that
Colonel Slocum would be reprimand
ed. Government officers generally
agreed that ihe unusual conditions
justified the pursuit, and no objection
from General Carranza regarding the
action of American troops is expected.
Further developments in the situation
were awaited with profound interest
in congress today.
Will Continue Raids.
Brigadier General Pershing report
ed that he IZ -;ican consul at El Paso
thinks there should be no objection to
American troops entering Mexico in
pursuit of Villa and that he would
wire his government recommending
co-operation.
Colonel Slocum telegraphed the war
denartment a brief report on the pur-
suit by the American
troops, wnicn
said:
I "I sent three troops under Major
i Tompkins across the border. They
j pursued Villa about five miles, drivins
j him into lough country where nis men

that stopped Tompkins's advance. The

Approximately 12,000 troops wit!

Columbus, N. M.. March 10. -An m-
n iipnpral TCmiliano Zapata
to march north and join in an attack
on the United States was sent by
Francisco Villa in January, according
to a copy of a letter found among
Villa's captured papers. The letter
was dated San Geronimo, Chihuahua,
January 6. 1916
"I shall not expend another shell
on brother Mexicans." Villa wrote in
the letter, "but will prepare and or
ganize to attack the Americans on
their own soil and let them know
that Mexico is a land of the free am.
the tomb of traitor?."
Villa proposed that the joint mov
ment with Zapata against the United
States should occur
months from
January 6. Zapata so tar as Known
made no move to accept and this may
have been responsible for Villa's de
cision to march on Columbus alone.

defeat at Agua Prieta last November
to the action of the United States gov
ernment in permitting Carranza mill-
tary authorities to send over American
territory reinforcements tor the aiex.

"At that time," Villa told Zapata,
"I restrained but with greatest diffi

Carranza, he also stated in the let

States, agreeing to lease Magdalena
bay for 99 years and giving over con
trol of the Mexican National railroad.
Several wounded Mexicans who had
lain out all night were found today in

El Paso, Tex,, March 10. Failure
of the machine guns to work at the
crucial time, when most needed, at
the beginning of the fight between the
Villa bandits and the Thirteenth cav
alry, at Columbus, is the cause at
tributed for the escape of the Villa
band across the border and also for
the relatively small loss of life among
them, according to Private Thomas
Barton, one of the hospital corps, who,
with Private E- M. Johnson, brought
five wounded soldiers and one wound
ed officer to El Paso this afternoon
According to the men. the attack be
gan near the edge of Columbus.
There were no guns or weapons of
any kind in the hospital. Johnson
said he killed one Villa bandit with an
axe which he threw as fleeing Mexican

BULLETIN
Censor on Army Move.
Washington, March 10. In a report late this afternoon,
General Funston told the war department he had accurate in
formation that Villa had three thousand troops with him, that
Carranza troops in his vicinity had fled and that he advised
against "Frittering away the time of the army guarding small
towns," while Villa might have an opportunity to escape. He
advised that the plans of the army for Villas capture be sur
rounded with secrecy for the sake of their success.
Fleet Not Ready.
Washington, March 10. The American fleet is not in con
dition to strike an efficient blow at an enemy, the house naval
committee was told today by Captain W. S. Sims, commander
of the New Superdreadnaught Nevada, which will be commis
sioned soon. The virtually unanimous conclusion of the war
college office, he said, was that "The fleet itself as an organ
ized force is not in efficient condition."
Another Is Dead.

the result of abdominal wound received in fighting Villistas

Garrison Offers Services.
Washington, March 10. Former Secretary Garrison came
to Washington today and called at the war department for a
conference with his successor Secretary Baker. Mr. Garrison
offered his services to the administration in the emergency
and is expected to remain to assist Mr. Baker for the present
at least.
Expect Attack Tonight
Washington, March 10. The administration has received
confidential information that another bandit attack somewhere
along the border may be made tonight.

In ten days or two weeks the state can

thirds of the fighting force composed
of men who have seen service in the

If the government should really
want Kansas militiamen for service in
Mexico or on the border, the adjutant
general's office will be ready for the
call. Both of the Kansas regiments

In the short time that might elapse
between a call and the date when
troops would be moved, officers of
the national guard would see the
busiest days of their lives. Every
member of the guard would be called
into service and actual training would
begin in the Kansas towns where local
companies are enlisted. By the time
the men were ready to depart, enlist
ments of former members of the
guard and men with service records
would be made in sufficient numbers
to bring the regiments to a war foot
ing. "We could easily nave 4,000 men
available for service men who have
had military experience and training
and are ready for active 83rvice." said
General Martin. "These men would
bring the two regiments to a full war
footing and would be available as soon
as transportation facilities could be
afforded. In the shortest possible
time, the state could send a full bri
gade three rogimerts. Trained offi
cers would be in charge of every com
pany." t With the new war scare on the Mex

ments came today to General Martin
and to Governor Capper. Private citi-
zens without experience wno seek
commissions would be greatly disap
pointed by General Martin. A man
who takes a commission must be a
I trained military man. General Martin
i stated
1 "Big corporations don't place nov-
ices and apprentices in charge of thei?
plants where great material losses
might be suffered. Why should we
place untrained men in charge of hu
man lives?" That is the stand of the

Washington, March 10. While

out afresh in congress.
-Senator McCumber anj Senator
Fall, both Republicans introduced res
olutions proposing armed action in
different ways Both resolutions were

quickly, but both house and senate

The Democrats generally expressed
jthe opinion that the president'! action
was wholly justified and the Repub
licans who have been urging action

been taken. There was no in of uia-
