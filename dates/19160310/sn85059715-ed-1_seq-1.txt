PATHS, March 10?There was no
change in the situation before Verdun.
either east or west of the Meuse, .
according to a semi-official announce- I
ment made here today.
'The announcement adds that the
violent bombardment continues on
both banks of the Meuse but there
lias been no infantry attacks by the
Germans. 11
The situation at Verdun is regard-; ,
ed as much better from the French
viewpoint as a result of yesterdny'fi
fighting. The public is greatly
cheered by reports of sucessful resistance
on the part of the defenders
of the fortress. Notwithstanding an
enormous expenditure or ammuni-|
tion, , the Germans have failed to
bend, much less break, the blue line.
The inference drawn by the general
public is that the German wave
has advanced as far as in its power
without further wastage oh a large 1
scale, which the German generni j
stair hesitates to make with four
army corps already put out of action.
Exhausted by three days of violent
efforts, the assailants called a rest to
replenish the depleted ranks of infantry.
The French took advantage
of the respite to sweep out the Germans
still remaining in Corbeaux
wood, and in this efTort were almost
sticceesful.

or (he Meuse attended by a series of
assaults on Douaumont has centered
interest once more on this portion
of the front. A good road runs
through the gently sloping ravine up
to the plateau before Douaumont,
possession of which would enable .the
attacking forces to take the defenses
on the Hank. Massed infantry well
supported hy artillery struggled to
win this easiest approach to the
famous position, but the French were
able^to hold ofT the aesallants and. at
the same time to deal with attacks I
from the village of Douaumont.
In the Woevre the Germans did i
not attempt to pursue their action j
further. j
The great success In battles up to!
the prespnt have been gained by'
means of violent shocks delivered by
rresn and especially prepared masses j
of Infantry and have generally
been achieved rapidly. Of such a
character was the German attack on
Verdun, which smashed Itself against
the French defenses on February 2d.
The Germans then began a series of
battles on small fronts. One day the
attack was made on the extreme left
from Bethlncourt to Goose I'll 11; ou
another day a blow was struck at the
extreme right at Fresnes and again
at Douauihont. i
All these were genuine attacks carried
out by masses of troops capable j
of undertaking serlouB action.French
military observers are ut
a loss to explain the object of these
assaults as It Is believed there Is little
probability they will have grave
consequences for the defenders. The:
Important question Is whether things (
will go on this way just as in the
case of the Frenjch offensive In the
Artois region, which, beginning May
ft, of last year, continued with dlmln
ishing force far Into Juno, or whcth*,
or there will be another great attack |
carried out by the most powerful:
moans and with that singleness of
aim which decides the victory.
Not often In the long battle have)''
the French infantrymen had the or-!
der to advance. When they did receive
it they showed that their offensive
spirit had lost nothing by
being hold in.
An official note has been Issued
categorically denying the statement
made in the German official commun-i
ication of March 9, that the village I
and armored fort of Vaux were captured
in a glorious night attack by*
Posen reserve regiments under tit?'
D leadership of General von Cornltz.
This assortlon, the note says, is in
every way false. i.
The nojto denies other statements
contained In recent official German
communications. , .

Youth Relieved of Big Roll, He
Says, and Suspect is
Jailed.
Soon after complaint wag made
Friday to the sheriff's office by Aukman
Lawson, young son of the late
Martin Lawson, a well-to-do farmer
of Green Valley, that he had been
robbed of $601 in cash as he lay
asleep In a room of the Annex hotel.
on North Fifth street. Deputy Sher|
iff Laco Wolfe arrested Marion,
, Boone, n young man with a criminal;
j record, and placed him behind;
bars of the county jail charged with
being implicated in the caBe. County
officers are searching for Homer Roy,
j another young criminal, who Is alleged
to have taken the $601.
.1 SclL< Honk Stock.
According to the story told the
, officers by young Lawson, he came to
I the city Thursday and sold some bank
stock for $1,600 in cash. Instead of |
| putting the money in a bank, or other
. safe place, as ordinary common sense:
. would indicate. It appears that hej
, lugged it around and took it to bed
, with him In a room of the hotel. For
some reason or other he went to bed!
! with his trousers on. Clerks nt the
,; hotel say he was intoxicated at the
. time. According to his tale, he wokei
, I up In the morning and caught Homer
,|Roy lying on the bed with him In
,! the act of pulling a bundle of $500 in
, banknote from one of his hip pock*
j eta. Ho grabbed Roy by the throat,
!the said, and a struggle ensued which
ended only when Roy relinquished
the roll.
Roy Runs Away,
Roy went into another room on
the same floor, tbe officers were told,
'donned his coat and bat and again
, joined Young Lawson, whereupon'
they went down stairs, through Hie
, lobby and out tbe front door. After
t they reached the-sidewalk, Roy qud.
denly broke away and ran to Clark
,4 at -thence?to- -North - Sixth- and
thence westward on Baltimore street
Then it was that young Lawson discovered
that a wad of $601 in bills
was missing from a front trousers
. pocket. The other $500 was In a
wad of currency in another hip pockl
et of Lawson's trousers. That is to!
I Bay, I.awson said he had the $1,000;
in his two hip pockets as the officers
, Bay they did not see the color of the i
.! money.
Aid Houglit.
I Marion Boone's arrest came about
. as the result of information lodged
with the slierlfn by June Powell. The
latter said that Boone approached
. htru Thursday night and asked his ,
i aid in "rolling" young Lawson, who
was said to have a big sum of money
on his person. Powell declined, ac .
cording to his tale to the sheriff, say- ,
ling humorously that while he might
.1 be pretty onery he hadn't gofr that ,
j onery.
, Have Served Time.
Young Boone, is the same fellow,
according to the authorities, who was
I heralded in police circles as being
. the leader of a band of boy bandits
t here about. He served a sentence of
> ' four months in the county jail some {
. time ago for highway robbery and
., also server half a year In the Weston
! jail for carrying a gun. He is a
i brother or George Boone, who was
shot a few days ago in Kansas City,
] Mo? by a Baltimore and Ohio railroad 1
'detective and'who is now In, a hos- <
i pltal there.
; Roy also served a sentence in the
| Harrison county jail not long ago for
bootlegging. He was once fined by i
! Magistrate W. E. Starcher for stealing,
ice from the Baltimore and Ohio ]
I railroad station here.
