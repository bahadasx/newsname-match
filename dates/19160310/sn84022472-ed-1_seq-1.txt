The expense of "maintaining the Re

ily on the pocketbeoks of the leading

others have been called on to pay dues
and assessments to maintain clubs in

ment, has been the , cause of much
dissatisfaction among the members of
the party and to end " this "and adjust
the matter along the plans of the Re

cided to organize, a club in the First
district and let this club furnish most
of the funds for the maintenance of
the headquarters rooms.

OLD BLACKSMITH
SHOP RUINED BY
NEWTOWN FIRE
; Newtown, March 10 The carriage
and automobile repair shop of How
ard Bassett, near the Newtown rail
road station, was burned to the
ground early today. Three automo
biles of customers, several wagons and
many tools and supplies were destroy
ed. The blaze was discovered at 3
o'clock,, and when the firemen arrived
the rear of the building was burning
briskly. . The firemen were unable to
prevent its spread. A small barn ad
joining, was saved. The loss is ap
proximately $6,000, on which there
was $3,500 insurance,- exclusive of
automobiles. ( :
The cause of the blaze is unknown
but it seems likely to the Newtown
firemen that- gasoline vapor, reached
the fire iii a stove, caused the blaze.
The building was a landmark. It
had been used for half a century as
a blacksmith shop.
The building was owned by C. How
ard Bassett. One of the automobiles
belonged to D. C. Peck, of Newtown,
and another to Dr. C. T. Baldwin, of
Derby. i
Nearby are located the Newtown
High school and St. Rose's R. C.
church, but the 'wind kept the flames
away from these buildings. -

DECLARES
WAR IS ON
London, March 10- The Portuguese
legation announces that a state of
war exists between the Portuguese
Republic and the German Empire.
Lisbon, March 10 Herr Rosen, the
German minister, late this afternoon
presented personally to ithe foreign
minister the ultimatum of the German
government. The public is deeply
concerned, because this action is sup
posed to mean war. In view of the
naval disclosures taken by the gov
ernment, the Germans still remaining
here are arranging to depart tonight.
A special train is held in waiting for
German diplomatic and consular of
ficials. v
White House Statement Is Firm.
The . following statement was issued at the White
House: '
"An adequate "force will be sent at onee in pursuit of
Villa with the single object of capturing him and putting
a stop to hp forays. ','.,.. . J..
"This can be done and will be done without the aidr
the local authorities and with scrupulous respect for tho
sovereignty of that republic." - v
It was declared that the United States will not con
sider the' punitive expedition an invasion of Mexico and;
will continue to deal with, the Carranza government. The ,
American government is still opposed to arned interven-;
tion in Mexico but has decided that the peace of both Mex
ico and the United States 'is imperilled by the continued
activities of Francisco- Villa.
The cabinet, which mettoday prior to the ordering of j
troops across the international line,. Was unanimous in de-
ciding that Villa must be caught. .
More Troops to Go to Border ...
General, Scott said today that the necessity of providing
even a stronger force for the border than it now has, while the
American troops are pperating in' Mexico, would mean using
some troops not there for the punitive expedition. They prob- ;
ably will be ordered from other posts. No plans have been
made so far as is known for the, use of the national guard.
It was said that the pursuit of Villa will" be undertaken in a
comprehensive way and organized plans will be laid for his ap-'
prehension.
Officials received the word of the
decision to go after Villa with troops
with undisguised satisfaction. Cabinet
members expressed themselves as
greatly pleased. Army officers voiced
unanimous approval. A general feel
ing of relief that the administration
had finally decided to take the steps
was apparent.
The President himself is firmly con
vinced of the necessity of eliminating
Villa' from the Mexican situation. He
is represented as just, as determined
to oust Villa as he Was to oust Vic
toriano Huerta. '
The announcement of the intention
of the President to send troops into
Mexico was accompanied by scenes
not equalled by those at the White
House since the determination to send
the Atlantic fleet to Vera Cruz in 1914.
Pains were taken by officials to
point out their hope that Carranza
would realize the spirit in which the
American troops were being sent after
Villa. . Carranza will be notified im
mediately that the United States has
no intention of taking any Mexican
territory whatever and will respect
the sovereignty of that nation.
American officials realize that Car
ranza may have difficulty in consent
ing to the presence of American sol
diers on -Mexican soil because of pop
ular feeling in his country. Carranza
Columbus, N. M., March 10 Fed
eral troops in increased number today
patrolled the Mexican border near Co
lumbus as a precaution against
further invasion of American territory
by Francisco Villa's bandit army
which yesterday in a surprise attack
upon this town killed 17 American
citizens and soldiers, wounded many,
burned buildings and looted stores be
fore being driven back into Mexico
by American troops. . More than one
hundred of the bandit army were
killed and about 200 were wounded in I

1 himself, however, is believed to be so j
eager for Villa's capture that he may i
co-operate with .the American troops, i
At the cabinet meeting the discus-J
sion of the situation was. brief and to ;
the point. The cabinet unanimously I
agreed that the only thing to do was
to send troops.
President Wilson took the same po-
sitlon and at once instructed Secre
tary Baker to issue the necessary or
ders. He also instructed Secretary!
Lansing to inform Carranza of the at
titude of the American government.
Leaders of both houses of Congresa
were immediately notified from the
White House of the President's action.
They approved his course.
Before deciding finally to send the.j
troops after Villa, the President con-.:
f erred, over the telephone, with Chair-
man Stone, of the Senate foreign re-
lations committee, who told him he
believed . the sentiment of Congress
would solidly support his action.
It was considered possible that with
in a few days President Wilson might
go before Congress to reelte the series
of acts of Villa which led to the order
ing of troops to effect his capture.
