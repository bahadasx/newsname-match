praised their action and expressed re

The return of the American troops
from MeJcico complicated the situation

congress shall direct the president

atrocities a^aihst, American citi

The McCumber resolution declares
that:
"Whereas, this government, «etu

A momentary let up in the des
perate infantry fighting around
Verdun is reported today from
Paris. The Germans have not
again attacked on either bank of
the Meuse, it is announced, but
violent bombardment of the de
fenses continues.
The French contradict the Ger
man claim of the capture of the
fort and village of Vaux. Similar
ly Paris claims the greater part of
Corbeaux wood remains in French
hands, despite the German Inti
mation to the contrary.
There are' signs of renewed
activity on the eastern front. The
Russians and Germans have been
feeling out each other's lines at
various pointq.
Reports from Salonlkl say it is
believed the allied forces thpre are
prepared to launch a great offen

The British admiralty admits the
loss of the torpedo boat destroyer

Paris, March 10.—-An official note has
•beea_.Jgsued categorically denying the
statement i|iad«fin the German official
'communication of March 9, "that the
village and armored forts of Vaux were
captured In a'glorious night attack by
Posen reserve regiments under the
leadership of General von Cornltz.
This assertion, the note says, i3 in ev
ery way false.
The note denied other statements
contained in recent German communi
caxi&ns.
The French official note says:
"German official dispatches of March
9 affirm that in a glorious nUht at
tack the Posen reserve regiments, un
der Command of Infantry General von
Cornitz, stormed the fort of Vaux
with a number of adjacent fortifica
tions. *Thls assertion is false In every
way. At the very hour when the Ger
man communication arrived the
French staff found that the' fort of
Vaux had not been attacked and that
the soldiers guarding it were calmly at
their posts.
"It has been remarked that since the
failure to storm Verdun, German offi
cial communications are full of false
statements."
Successfully Defend Positions.
The new situation at Verdun Is re
garded as much better from the
French viewpoint as a result of yes
terday's fighting. The public is great
ly cheered by news of a successful de
fense.
Notwithstanding an enormous ex
penditure of ammunition and unstinted
sacrifice of life, the Germans havo
failed to bend, much less break, th^
blue line.
Exhausted by three days of violent
efforts the assailants called a half
day's rest to replenish the depleted
ranks of infantry. The French too.i
•advantage of the respite to sweep out
the Germans still remaining in Cor
beaux wood and in this effort was al
most successful.
Center of Interest Shifts.
The renewal of fighting east of the
Meuse, attended by serious assaults on
Douaumont has centered interest once
more on this portion of the front. A
good road runs thru the gently sloping
ravine up to the plateau before Douau
mont, possession of which would en
able the attacking forces to take .the
defenses in the flank.' Masses of in
fantry. well supported by artillery,
struggled hard to win command of this
easiest approach to the famous posi
tion, but the French were able to hold
off the assailants and at the same time
to deal with attacks from the village of
Douaumont
Offensive Spirit^Net Lost.
Not often in the long battle have the
French infantrymen had the order \o

showed that their offensive snirit hall

had such opportunities on Wednesday
