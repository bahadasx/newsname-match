Another Good Producer in the Welsb
Oil Field.
Mr. John Carrodine, driller for the
Bull Frog Oil Co., has just brought in a
new well in the Welsh oil field. The
well is a splendid one and is pumping
about two hundred and fifty barrels per
day. This is a great addition to the
production of the field and shows very
plainly that we have the oil in abund
ance in the Welsh field and it is only up
to the perseverence of our friends
operating in the field to get it.

People from -,Il ýv: F'rish Cather
to hear Pleasant, Coco
and Aswel!.
One of the largest crowds ever
gathered in Jefferson Davis par
ish at a political meet:ng, greeted
Col. R. G. Pleasant, Democratic
candidate for Governor; Judge A.
V. Coco, candidate for Attorney
General and Dr. J. B. Aswell con
gressman from the eighth district
at Jennings last Friday night. At
the meeting were the most re
presentative democrats from all
over the parish gathered to hear
the arguments of these staunch
supporters of the party platform.
Among those who attended the
meeting from Welsh were Mayor
W. B. Gabbert, Dr. R. R. Arce
neaux, Dr. J. H. Cooper, Dr. B. J.
LaCour, A. L. Hebert, A. E.
Lognion. A. 0. Fontenot, Euzeb
Louviere, Uncle Charlie Stewart,
Etienne Hardy, Marshall, A. G.
Fontenot and R. S. Greer.
Mayor Jno. Gamble presided at
the meeting introducing as the
first speaker Col. R. G. Pleasant.
Col. Pleasant in a plain open,
clear and concise manner set forth
the policy he would follow out as
governor of this great common
wealth, convincing his audience
of his ability to fulfill every
promise. He showed clearly that
the arguement of Jno. M. Parker
that he was the ring candidate
was the mere essence of fallacy
as everyone knows that the coun
try precincts supported him
stronger in the priniary than didl
the city and if he is to be termed
r the ring candidate then that ring
must be a broad ring and a most
valuable asset to the common
wealth as it includes in its broad
scope all those who seek the poli
tical uplift of the state.
He showed Parker up in, his
true light as a one-m:n-rinnr, iim
self the ori-rinator of the s,:ret
ballot in Nev Or(ceans not the
1)ink ticket, but a white one a copy
of which he displayed before the
c` u'!l nee. CoIonel !'ie'.-ant re

Imou- attacksL of ':';rker on his
er:.' i.lacy. Ile was folioiWved on
the rYst H byl" t e 1Hon. ,ud:.e A.
. ( o (laT o d: rltic nmine for
the offihe of attorney general.
.Judge Coco is one of I.ouisiana's
most ab e speakers and he held his
audience by eloquent oratory as
well as by the force of his argu
ment first showing how Parker
emulated the animal from which
his party derived its name. The
judge's education and abi!ity to
speak in both French and English
had aroused the ire of the said Jno.
M. until in his wrath that indivi
dual had forced on the self-called,
self-dominated, self-styled pro
gressive convention the nomina
tion of E. B. Dubisson as progres
sive candidate for attorney gener
al, in opposition to the regular
democratic nominee.
Wnen Dr. Asweli's turn came
it only remained for his lance to
make a few incisions in the Hon.
Jne M.'s calloused hide when the
volumes of his rottenness poured
forth freely. After diagnosing
Mr. Parker's case, Dr. Aswell
took up in detail every phase of
the Mooser's inert rottenness.
Parker solicits the votes of the
farming element on the grounds
that he is himself a farmer. Visit
him at his palatal "farm" on Na
poleon Ave. in New Orleans, or
his Pass Christian "farm" and
see the kind of a farmer he is. As
a sample of his interest in the
farmers welfare note the thou
sonds of dollars worth of cotton
samplings he took from the
farmers of the state, in the capa
city of one of the leading brokers
and then examine his relations
with Theodore Rooseveit. If heis,
as he claims, p)rogressive, then he
is no more entitled to the republi
can vote of the state than he is the
democratic, for the progressives
are not recognized as a party in
this state. Hle is backed by
Roosevelt and if elected would be
deminated in His administration
by the same Rooseve t and in
!.u In es.
In e osing his remarks Dr. As.
