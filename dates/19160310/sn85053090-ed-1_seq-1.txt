VOLUME VIII.
EKALAKA, (FALLON COUNTY) MONTANA, FRIDAY, MARCH 10, 1916.
NUMBER 10
DEMOCRATS LINE-UP
Precinct Vacansies Filled And
Wilson Clubs Urged.
The Fallon county democrats
in session at the mass meeting
Monday transacted considerable
business pertaining to the county
organization. Vacancies in all
precincts where no committee
men had been elected were filled
and resolutions adopted. A large
ni mber of party supporters at
te\ded the meeting regardless of
the sudden change in the weath
er and the general discussion
amongst them wiil tend to inject
added enthusiasm for the party's
success this fall. C. J. Dousman
of Baker presided as temporary
chairman over the meeting, in
the absence of George Dougherty
who is still at the hospital at
Miles City. Judge Daniel O'Hern
of the Seventeenth Judicial Dis
trict was present and gave a very
interesting talk on the election
laws and the duties of the voter.
A suggestion for the organization
of Wilson Clubs in the different
precincts made by Judge O'Hern
wos favorably received and it is
expected that within a short
time this method of increasing
the party strength throughout
Fallon county wi'l have been tak
en. It was decided that the
present chairman ard secretary
of the central committee hold
over in office until a meeting at
some later date.
"Tex" Taylor Goes Over.
"Tex" Taylor who was arrest
ed here about a month ago on a
charge of assaulting an officer
appeared before Judge O'Hern
this week and received an inde
terminate sentence of from one
to three years. He was released
on parole however on the condi
tion that he behave himself.
Freedom from the confinement
of the county jail proved to much
lor Tex and he proceeded to cele
brate and get himself pinched
for being drunk and disorderly.
The court immediately ordered
him sent to Deer Lodge for the
full term of his original sentence.
Band to Re-organize.
Local musicians have been
agitating the reorganization of
of the Ekalaka Band the past
week and we predict that it
won't be long before the boys
commence regular practice again.
It has been found that some six
teen eligible members still reside j
here, which after a little work 1
should be abie to again render!

The Wooly West.
Those of you who have come
to beleive Montana as having
passed from that wild and wooly
stage of a few years ago should
not overstretch yourselves in
passing remarks along that line,
especially if we are to accept
eastern press reports to the con
trary, such as the following
"western dispatch" which re
cently appeared in the Bingham
ton, N. Y. papers:-
"In the beautiful little village of
Cow Creek, 40 miles from Malta,
the proprietor of a boarding
house was shot by an admirer of
his wife at a town dance. They
stopped the dance for a moment,
carted the body outside and start
ed dancing again.
"In the meantime the author
ities of Blaine county swooped
down upon the hall, but refused
to act on the ground that the hall
was situated in Phillips county.
Then came the sheriff of Phillips
county, who arrested all of the
34 dancers and sent for surveyors
to run the boundary line between
the two counties to find out who
was responsible.
"For four days and nights the
surveyors worked. For four
days and nights the dance con
tinued. The sheriff danced with
the woman over whom the mur
der had been done. The woman
danced with the man who killed
her husband. A steer was killed
andithere was plenty to eat, fol ks
took turns at sleeping on the floor.
"In the meantime the fiddlers
grew tired and the body of the
murderer in an outhouse froze
stiff. But everybody had a good
time. At the end of the fourth
day the surveyors announced
that the hall was right square on
top of the county line and they
didn't know where the murder
happened.
"The Blaine County Leader
printed this editoral comment:
'Neither Phillips nor Blaine
county want murder trial. The
shooter dosen 't want to be tried
at all; and the shootee dosen't
care a whoop about the murder.
So why all the fuss?
Mike Moolick drove a load of
passengers to Baker Wednesday
morning, including Dr. Geo. Ba
ker and L. L. Wheeler who will
transact business at the county
seat and Wm. Freeze who left
for a visit with his daughter Mrs.
John Ryan at Gillette, Wyo.
Horace Hardy and Harry Raw
son passed through town Sunday
afternoon being enroute to their
homes near Sykes from a trip to
Camp Crook. The roads via Bell
Tower were found almost impas
sible so they returned via the
mail route. Mr. Rawson had tak
en his wife to the hospital at
Camp Crook for treatment.
