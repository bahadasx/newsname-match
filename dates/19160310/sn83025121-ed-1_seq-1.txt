Greasers A re Driven Back Qver Line
and More Than One Hundred Die
(Associated Press By Federal Wireless)
WASHINGTON. March 10. A force of Mexicans, variously
estimated at between seven hundred and fifteen hundred,
raided across the New Mexican line yesterday, attacking by surprise
the little town of Columbus and giving battle to a small force of
American cavalrymen stationed there. Repulsed by the Americans,
the Mexicans fled back to their own territory, pursued into Mexico
by the American troops. Yesterday afternoon, five miles south of
the border, the Mexican rearguard turned to give battle and a smart
engagement was fought
. TROOPERS COMB BACK
Late last night the Americans
returned, being in insufficient
force to meet the enemy, which
includes the main Villista army,
numbering between pne thou
sand and fifteen hundred well
armed men.
It is now expected that the
Villistas will return for it second
raid, the little village of Peming
being picked out as the next point
of attack. The residents there are
preparing to defend themselves.
The women and children have
been brought together ' in the
school house, which is barricaded
with sandbags, while the men are
armed and on the alert.
MEXICAN SIGNALS FLASH
Until late in the night the sig
nals being exchanged between the
various Villa detachments could
be seen flashing in the sky.
The whole border is alert and
all steps are being taken to pre
vent any further surprises.
In the fighting at Columbus,
fifteen Americans, including one
woman,' were killed. Of these
eight were civilians and seven

troopers of the Thirteenth Cav
alry. Five cavalrymen were
wounded. The Mexican loss is
reported to be in the neighbor
hood of three hundred, of whom
one hundred were killed.
The pursuing troopers, in the
fighting' in Mexico, have lost one
private killed and a number of
wounded, including Capt George
Williams, adjutant
VILLA LEADS RAIDERS
The Mexican raiders are led
by Pancho Villa in person, whose
presence, , on the border was
known for the past several days.
He was believed to be endeavor
ing to mak$ his way across the
line into 4ne United States on a
peaceable mission' intending to
proceed to Washington to make
a personal explanation to Presi
dent Wilson of the conditions in
Mexico, and to enter a personal
denial of complicity in any way
with the massacre of Americans

west of El Paso. Here the head
quarters of the Thirteenth Caval
ry have been temporarily estab
lished, with the machine gun de
tachment and troops E, P, G, H;

tion. Yesterday only three, troops
were in camp when the raid took
place, the other troops being on
patrol duty along the border, east
and west N
SENTRY FIRST TO FALL
It was shortly before four
o'clock, and still dark when the
sentry, Private t Griffin,, caught
sight of a body ol mounted men
moving toward the house occu
pied by Lieut J. P. Lucas.. His
challenge brought no response
from the Mexicans and the sol
dier fired, killing one ol the raid'
ers. Instantly a ragged fire broke
out from the .underbrush, and the
Mexicans' leading the attack scat
tered, as they began to fire.' One
of the bullets struck Griffin, who
was, therefore,: the first man to
fall on the American side. His
stand, had given Lieutenant Lu
cas time in which to leave the
house and get the machine-gun
platoon into position.
In the meantime the alarm
brought the men of the three
troops of Cavalry into the streets
of the little town, and under the
command of Col. Herbert J. Slo
cum, who was armed with a re
volver, there began the fight (hat
may result in a final settlement
of the long vexed Mexican
problem.

There were less than two hun-
tlred of the Americans and they
had been taken by surprise by an
overwhelming number of Mex
icans, for in a- few moments ater
the alarm the underbrush and the
outlying shacks poured hundreds
of the bandits upon the soldiers.
MANY CIVILIANS KILLED
It was then that the worst of
the fighting was done and It was
during that time that the flying
bullets killed many of. the , civil
ians. But the weight of numbers
carried the attacking party Iri to
the streets of the town and for
a time the fighting was' hand-to-hand,

If they thought that they were

were mistaken in their man. for

-Villa chose to stand when he
saw that it was to be a running
fight unless he did so. ; Besides
the ifexicans vby this time had
augtimented their forces' until
they must have numbered at least
fifteen hundred men. , At the' ad
vance guard of the Americans
came in touch with the' bandits
they were met with a heavy dis
charge that killed one private,
whose name as not yet been re
ported, and wounded Capt Geo.
Williams, adjutant who was with
the squadron. ',
' VILLA DRAWS OFF MEN
The fighting here did not last
long, and Villa began to draw off
his men, leaving a, rear-guard
screen to hold the Americans in
check, while his main body mov
ed further south and west It is
believed, however, that he lost
heavily in proportion to the num
bers engaged, for the Americans
estimate that at least seventy
five Mexicans were killed in the
fight south of the border, and two
hundred wounded.
In the chase one of the Thir
teenth cavalrymen picked up a
valise, which proved to have been
dropped by General Villa him
self. In it were a number of pa
pers, among which was a general
order to his men, instructing

them to "kill all Americans you
may find."
FIGHTING IS FORCED
Sticking like leaches to the re
treating Mexicans the cavalry
men followed them deeper into
Mexico, and twice more brought
them to a halt and forced them
to fight. Three skirmishes in all
were fought before Major Tomp
kins decided that he was getting
too far from his base, and return
ed to the north side of the lne
and reported to his commanding
officer.
In the mean time Colonel Slo
cum had sent messages to the
rest of his command and had
gathered most of his regiment
about him and is reported to be
ready to res'umer the Jmri'.iit at
once, unless ordered to remain
where he is.
SLOCUM MAY PURSUE
. . Early in the day, immediately
after clearing Columbus of the
bandits, Colonel Slocum had sent
to one" of the senators from Mex
ico, a message which read: "Will
pursue until we have" captured
the whole bunch."
It is believed that the admin
istration intends to give the army
a free hand in the attempt to
catch the bandits, as such an ac
tion is not to be considered an
invasion of Mexico.
In certain official circles it is
generally admitted that the sit-
