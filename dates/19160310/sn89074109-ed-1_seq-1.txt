T|ie Farmers' Paper
The monster mass meeting held
last evening at the Beach Opera
House for the purpose o£ perfect
ing some kind of a commercial or
ganization for this city was one of
'-the most enthusiastic and most
harmonious meetings ever held in
this eity. The large hall was prac
tically packed to the limit with peo
ple and the spirit of harmony and co
operation seemed to pervade the en
tire assembly.
J. P. Reeve acted as chairman of
the meeting and briefly explained the
purffose of the gathering and discus
sed Hie objects and benefits of a
commercial organization. R. E. Ful
ler acted as secretary.
A large delegation of live wire
"boosters from Miles City came down
ot tell something of the work of their
"Chamber of Commerce" and help
start the ball a-rolling. The first
Miles City man called on by the
-chairman was Mr. DeCarl, who
spoke on "Why we established the
Budget System at Miles City.'* He
told briefly of the history of the
'budget system, which was first tried
out in Davenport, Iowa, a little later
at Aberdeen, S. D, and soon spread
very rapidly to other cities. He
states that the business men of Miles
City saved a large amount of money
annually by handling charities and
donations on the budget plan and
"the expeditures are more wisely and
-economically directed.
Rev. Keniston of this city, who as
sisted the Miles City people in or
ganizing and financing their cham
ber, was next called on. He spoke
•on the establishment of the "Red
Trail" and on the benefits and ad
vantages of a great system of na
tional highways. He reported that
there is a probablit.v that bridge
will be built across the Missouri
River at Bismarck and that if it is
built the people along the route of
"the Red Trail will not be asked to
furnish the funds for it but that fie
two counties adjoining will stand the
-expense.
Mr. Otis, Secretary of the Miles
City Chamber next spoke at some
length on the work of their organiz
ation and the details of its organ
ization and management. He warn
ed a chamber against permitting pol
iitcs and factionalism and stated
that it should be run solely as a bus
iness institution.
MrJeleneck, Pres. of the Miles
City Saddlery Co., in speaking on
*'jSetting New Members" said it is
important to continually get new
members as the vim and energy of
old members naturally diminishes
•with long service.
Chairman Reeve then reported that
the committee here had secured
-pledges to the amount of $2751.00
and that there were still a few bus
iness men who the committee had
been unable to see.
The last talk was given by Mr.
Calvin, President of the Calvm In
vestment Co., of Miles City. He
spoke on "What a Good Chamber
of Commerce Can do for the Farm
ers." He suggested numerous ways
in which the chamber may be able
to assist the farmers of the commun
ity to develop their farms and im
'prove their farm homes. And, he
said, "Do not forget that the farm
ers will make good members of your
chamber of commerce.*'
Mr Reeve then read the consti
tution and by-laws as proposed by
'the committee. They were adopted

G.
B. Newcomb
former chaplain of the state peni
tentiary, and superintendent of the
Society of the Friendless, occupied
the pulpit at the Congregational
church anl gave an instructive and
interesting address Rev. South
wick officiatel at the services at the
M. E.
church. The Chronicle regrets
that we have been unable to secure
a synopsis of Rev. Southwick's ser
mon. The others follow:
Matt. l(i:26, 27. "For what is a
man profited, if he shall gan the
whole world, and lose his own soul?
For the Son of man shall come in
the glory of his Father with his
angels and then he shall reward
every man according to his works."
"This text gives a problem that
deserves the study of the longest
life and it is probable that no man
has ever solved it. This text was
given by the great Master mind, to
induce his hearers to embrace Chris
tianity. In embracing Christianity
in those lays a man frequently lost
his character, property, liberty and
even life itself. If a man would he
a Christian, he must be one at some
expense. I believe that we are ev
en surroundel by the three-fold glory
of the Father, Son and IIolv Angels:
and that even now the light of the
great judgement day is beginning to
dawn for some of us —that day
v.'lien lie shall reward every man ac­
cording to his works
"I see that we have in our posses
sion a jewel called a soul, a jewel of
inestimable value. The soui is di
vine in its origin.—When Gol want­
ed to make a sun, he said— 'let there
he light and it was so. But when
he wanted to make a soul, he said—
"Let us make man in our own
image." The soul is astonishing in
its properties. Even in its present
state, it is 'great in ruins.' There
are three prominent properties of
this priceless jewel, which are Vi
tality, Rationality, and Immortality,
The soul has motive, power, and can
make progress il has the power to
understand: survey the past, look
arounl upon the present, ami glance
prospectively into the future: the
power to judge, to select, and to re
fuse. Therefore it is accountable.
AYe are not from cverl-tsling—but
we are to everlasting. The soul has
fallen from its glory.—The whole
plan of icdeeniing love evidently
shows the depth and ruin .£ man as
a fallen being.
"The enemy of a man's soul must
consider it of great value because
he keeps pursuing it even to the very
last hour of earth life. The angels
of God must consider it of great
value because there is rejoicing in
heaven when a sinner repents and
cries 'God be merciful to me a sin­
ner.' Our Lord does not think a
mansion in heaven—an unfading
crown—an everlasting kingdom, too
rich or too valuable for it. I see the
folly of the man who barters away
this immortal principle for the few
paltry moments of sensual delight.
Suppose you do have the world, and
you enjoy it for seventy or eighty
years finally the end comes—you
must leave the world, and whither
shall you turn? Even though you
have gained the honors of the world
and the wealth of all the nations—
these are but material—but the im
mortal principle is entirely destitute
and not only destitute, but lost, ir
retrieveablv lost. I see the wisdom
of the man who is determined to
have his soul saved at any cost. 'I
will arise and go to my Father'
that is wisdom."
Superintendent Geo. B. Newcomb
of the North Dakol.v Society of the
riendless spoKe lo capacity house
at the Congregational church Sun
day night and at the Beach Opera
House Monday night. At the Opera
house school children were admitted
free, and the house was packed to
the galery with the youth of Beach.
Using moving picture and lantern
slides Supt. Newcomb brought be
fore his uudience graphic pictures
of the petty beginnings of crime and
of youth traps set by the unscrup
ulous to decoy boys and girls from
the paths of sobriety and virtue, lie
emphasized the laxity of parents in
allowing young boys and girls to
roam the streets, meet clandestinely,
keep company indiscriminately with
youth and men of questionable if not
unwholesome character.
Sex knowledge should first be com
municated by the father to his boy
and by the mother to her daughter,
and that in no uncertain manner as
to its perils as well as to its nobler
possibilities. A growing disregard for
the defence of virtue is one of
the alarming conditions of the day
leading to lives of shame, the peni
tentiary and insincere marital re
lations. Boys and girls should bo
kept off the streets, should be given
the benefit of agreeable home sur
roundings, and should he mothered
and lathered. Habits of dissolution
and impurity are the threatening
menace of the purity of our women,
and the nobility of our men!
He insisted that it is not to the
credit of any young woman to have
a coterie of men (locking after her
nor does it speak well for the young
man to be a member of such a co
terie.
The latter part of his address
was a potential arraignment of the
cigarette showing its subtle but cer
tain assault upon the physical and
moral health of its victim. lie call
ed attention to the fact that North
Dakota has a rigorous anticigarette
law designed to protect the victims
of that habit from being victimized
under authority of law.
He also related some touching in
cidents of the rescue of discharged
prisoners, and urged upon his aud
ience the kindly offices of employ
ment and secrecy in their defense.
At the Congregational service
twenty dollars was donated to this
noble philanthropy. The adult ad
missions at the Opera House lacked
seventy-live cents of paying the
rent. Supt. Xcwcoinb approached
some of the merchants for aid, but
upon being advised of the fact that
the merchants have established a
Budget system of takin«r«care jf
worthy charities, left with some of
the members a request for a dona
tion from the Club, and commending
the plan adopted, left the City for
his home in Bismarck.

Special Train of 57 Cars of Armored

Shops Pass Through Beach
Wednesday.
on
A mammoth shipment of fifty
seven cars of armored automobile*
passed through Beach over the Nor
thern Pacific lines Wednesday a spe
cial thru train conveying the ship
ment from St. Paul to Seattle, Wash.
"Considerable speculation as to the
exact nature of the shipment is rife
local railroal men disclaiming any
knowledge of the cargo. The ship­
ment, according to stencilled legends
on the cases, contained seventy
"portable 2-ton machine shops,"
each mounted on Pierce-Arrow au
tomobile trucks, and purported to
contain small latches, forges anl oth­
er equipment, which suggests that
the machines are to be used in mak­
ing hurried big-gun and ritle repairs
on the battlefield. It has been rum
ored however, that the machines are
in reality armored automobiles,
mounted with heavy guns, though
this is probably not the case.
The shipment originated at Buf
talo, New York, and was being rush
ed through to Seattle, Wash., with
all speed, where steamships are im
waiting to take the cargo across the
Pacific to its port destination, Vlad
ivostok, Russia. Armed ships will
act as convoy. Each machinc is uni
formly boxed, and packed in a fash
ion that will facilitate its speedy
handling by crams at the Seattle
docks.
Some speculation has been made
connecting the mysterious airship
flights of Duluth and Superior with
Wednesday's shipment, the theory
being that the flights were made
by
spies who were devising drastic
means to prevent the consignment
from reaching its destination. So
far as kown, no guards accompanied
the train.
