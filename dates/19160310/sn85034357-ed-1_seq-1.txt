Witten-Shumate Bill Passed Vir?
ginia Senate, and Saloons at
Pocahontas Will Have To
Go Out of Business.
The Virginia State Senate passed
the Witten-Shumate amendment to
the Harman law on Tuesday night,
which amendment makes the town of
Pocahontas dry on May 1st, when the
present licenses expire. The passage
of this bill is a great victory for the
temperance workers in this section of
the State, and a feather in the cap of
Representative Witten and Senator J.
Powell Royall, of this district. To
each of these gentlemen is due a large
part of the credit for the passage of
the bill.
No little credit, also, should be
given to the other public spirited cit
zcns of this town and Pocahontas and
Graham, who spent much time in
Richmond, at their own expense in
the interest of the bill.
Rev. Mr. Rickman, the Baptist min?
ister at Pocahontas, spent several
days in Richmond fighting for the pas?
sage of the bill, as did also Rev. C. R.
Brown, G. W. Doak, of this town,
and W. B. P. White, composed the
"lobby" from this county, who repre?
sented the people in the committee
meetings and in private caucuses in
Richmond, and much of the credit
for the enactment of the measure is
due these gentlemen.
Drug Stores Shut Off Entirely.
The provisions of the Harman law,
which i3 operative in the counties of
this Senatorial district, urc such that
liquor cannot be sold under anv con?
ditions. The Ouart a Month" pro?
vision in the Mapp bill cuts no ice
in this neck of the woods, for the Har?
man laws provides, that "it shall be
neither manufactured no sold in this
district" under any conditions.
The Richmond Times-Dispatch of
Wesdnesday had the following ac?
count of the passage of the Witten
Shumate bill in tho Senate:
"By a vote of 27 to 5 the Senate
yesterday passed the bill introduced
in the House by Delegates Witten and
Shumate, which was designed to make
Pocahontas, in Tazewell county, "dry"
after May 1.
Senator Royall, TazowolPs repre?
sentative in the Senate, and Senator
Trinklc, who comus from the same
section of the State, stood sponsors
for the measure. Representing prop?
erty owners, who are vitally interest?
ed in the policy laid down by the leg?
islature for the little Southwestern
{.own, Senator Buchanan, of Mnrion,
voiced a vigorous protest against the
apparent discrimination between Po?
cahontas and the rest of the State in
making it dry six months prior to the
time when the general prohibition act
goes into effect.
"The public schools of Pocahontas,
said Senator Buchanan, would be
obliged to close down if the legisla?
ture enacted a bill which would de?
prive the communitv of $22,0000 of
revenue derived from the liquor licens?
es to be issued on May 1. Man" of his
constituents, he said, had contracted
obligations in the town, predicated up?
on the belief that the saloons would
be allowed to operate until the state?
wide prohibition becomes operative in
Virginia.
Senntor Royall plead for the passage
of the bill in nnswe rto the demand,
he said, of thousands of people of his
district who are of the opinion that it
is absolutely necessary, in the inter?
ests, of not only the town itself, but
for the surounding country, that the
saloons be closed down. Murder, he
said, is a very common occurence in
Pocahontas, which he denominated as
"a vcrtiable hell on earth."
The sentiment of a majority of the
people, said Senator Royall, had not
been brought to bear upon the Senate
for the reason that they are not able
to employ paid lobbyists to advance
their interests.
The vote stood:
Y^ns?Messrs. Allen, Andrews, Bar
ham, Bowers, Byrd, Conrad, Corbitt,
Davis, Early, Garrett, Gayle, Goodloe,
Goolrich, ftcning, Jeffreys, Jordan,
Lacy, Mapp, Rison, Robertson, Royall,

NO HELP FROM ENGLAND.
(Washington Post.)
While Franco is sacrificing tens of
thousands of men at Verdun, bearing
the brunt of u collossul German drive
the British troops everywhere are
quiet. There was a blutF at action
near Ypres, Uut it amounted to noth?
ing.
Belgian, French, Rusian, Italian,
Serbian?all the allies except Great
Britain have stood their ground or
come back after defeat. Great Britain
is the only government that has
abandoned a Held. The only decisive
retreat during the war, the only
abandonment of a campaign, has been
that of Great Britain at Gallipoli.
Great Britain is the only govern?
ment that has boon asked by its
allies to "get busy." It is only against
Great Britain that complaint has been
found. Great Britain alone is guilty
of failure to assist the allies in a
pinch. The late.a complaint comes
from no less a person than George
Ciemenceau, former premier o f
France. "None will understand," he
writes in yesterday's Post, "why we
are throwing men uncounted into
the Me?se furnaces, while our British
friends who ask no better than to
attack, are retained in their trenches.
The measure of a powerful attack
they could deliver in the north of
France would be the measure of help
they could afford in Verdun. You
ennot always choose your own mo?
ment in war. When it is imposed, you
must accept it."
It is the same old story. As ex
presed by Supreme Court Justice
Golf, of New York, England is "the
eyil genius of France and every na?
tion blighted by her allies.
When Belgium was being destroyed
England did not save her. When Rus?
sia was rolled back, England did not
save her. When Serbia was crumpled
up, England did not help her. And
now, when France is in direct dis?
tress, England does not help her.
Actions speak louder than words.
The words of England to her allies
are cordial, encouraging and full of
promise. The acts of England to?
ward her allies are selfish, cruel and
perfidious. Thus England is true to
her traditions, true to her selfish pur?
pose and win and bold dominion by
playing one nation against another
and profiting by the misfortunes of
all.

Bland County Man is Thought
To Have Frozen to Death,
While on Way to Burke's
Garden on Business.
A special dispatch from Wylheville
to the Roanok ? Times, says:
News has just reached Wytheville
of the finding of the dead body of
Creed Fanning, age 05, a well known
citizen of Bland county, on the south
side of Burke's Garden mountain,
near the line between Bland and Taze?
well counties. Mr. Manning for a num?
ber of years, was the proprietor of a
hotel at Bland Court House.
According to the reports he left
his home at Bland Court House about
two weeks ago for Burke's Garden on
business. At first his family thought
nothing of his failure to return home,
thinking that perhaps tho "inclement
weather had detained him or that he
was visiting relatives in Burke's Gar?
den.
Finally, becoming alarmed at his
continued absence, they sent a mes?
senger across the mountains to the
home of a relative, who lives in
Burke's Garden, to find out what had
become of him. The messenger learn?
ed that Mr. Fanning, about ten days
ago, had started for his home, one
of his relatives accompanying him as
far ns the top of the Burke's Gar?
den mountain, where ho left his rela?
tive, telling him thnt ho would walk
the remaining distance to Bland
Court House. This was the last seen
of him alive.
Upon the receipt of this informa?
tion a searching party of about one
hundred men was organized in Bland
for the purpose of searching the
mountains for Mr. Fanning, or his
body.
After a two-days senrch his body
was found on the south side of Burke's
Garden mountain, in one of the wild?
est and most inaccessible sections of
the county. The presumption is that
in some wnv he stroked from the road
along which he was traveling, became
lost and was frozen to death.
The body was in a bad condition,
being partially consumed by wild ani?
mals.

TAZEWELL, VIF
BOOSTER
MEETING
Hoard of Trade of Tazewell and
North Tazewell Rejuvenated
ami Given New Life in Meet?
ing on Tuesday Night.
The Tnzowoll-North Tazewell Hoard
of Trade, instead of disbanding, is now
stronger than ever before, and from
the interested manifested at ? the
meeting held last Tuesday night, will
be more useful than ever before.
The meeting was hold in the Court
House and was presided over bv the i
President, R, C. Chapman, with W. G.
O'Brien as secretary.
A vote showed that it was the unan?
imous consent of the members present
that the organization continue. Mr.
W. A. Scott, of the Tazewell Manufac?
turing Company, outlined briefly the
necessity for for an organization of
this character in everv town, espec?
ially in Tazewell, which is far above
the average town in manv respects.
Mr. B. W. Stras, jr., of Stras, Har
man & Company, who recently became
a member of the Board of Trade, out?
lined some of the difficulties encoun?
tered by organizations of this charac?
ter in keeping up the interest and the
attendance upon the regular meetings.
The suggestions he made will likely
be taken u by the body in the near
future.
Secrelar ? O'Brien stated that by
the provisions there was not a mem?
ber present aualifl ?d to vote or take |
part in the discussions. There was an \
immediate rush to pay up, and Treas?
urer Preston was kept busy for a few
minutes taking moaev.
After the members present had
qualified themselves to vote, Mr. Chap?
man, who has been president of the
organization for the past year, offer?
ed his resignation, as did also Secre?
tary O'Brien. The acceptance of these
resolutions proved to be very much
against the wishes of the members,
a vote showing not a single one in fa- I
vor of their resignations. There was
nothing else for them to do but "serve
their time," which expires on the
third Tuesday in June, at. which time
new officers of the organization will
be elected.
A motion was made to appoint a
committee to notify the absent mem?
bers and those in arrears for dues
that one year's dues, ($2.00) would be
accepted in full of account to June,
this year, and solicit their continued
membership, and urge upon them to
come to the meetings.
The question of the new depot at
North Tazewell was discussed, and j
B. W. Stras, W. (J. O'Brien and W. T.
Gillespie wcer appointed a committee
to take the matter up with the rail?
road officials and see what could be
done.
Other matters of local interest were
discussed, among them being a water?
ing trough for horses, which the civic
association have under discussion. It
was pointed out that horses coming
from the country have nowhere to be
watered, and that much suffering on
hot days results from the lack of a
suitable place for watering the stock.
A committee, composed of Jeff Ward,
L. A. Tynes and W. B. Leslie was ap?
pointed to co-operate with the ladies
of the civic association and do what
was necessary to provide the trough.
The next meeting of the Board of
Trade will be held the third Tuesday
in April, at which time a full at?
tendees of all members is urged.

THE TAZEWELL SUPPLY CO.
Have Forsaken Old Home For
Distant Farts, But Are Meas?
uring up With The Hesl of
Them.
This ollice has had correspondence
this week with Tazewell boys who
have left the old home county?two of
them the Slate, who merit special
mention and commendation. One. of
1 bein is B. V. Poery, now a successful
merchant at Cocburn. He is a son of
Preston Peery, of this county. Ed.
Rosonbaum says of him: he is a line
fellow and straight as a shingle."
T. A. Repass, the insurance man, says
"be is us prompt as a clock, and doing
a line business.
The editor has the best reasons
in the world to believe it all. When
you hit a fellow with a good sized
subscription bill and lie doesn't even
grunt, but says, "here it is, best wish?
es," you have a pretty safe fellow in
band.
The other two bays are Cecils. They
moved to Texas from Tazewell some
years ago. Their letter bead reads:
"Cecil & Company." One of lliem is
W. M. und the other C. W. Cecil.
One of these, tbe writer does not. know
which one, is a son of the lute Chester
Cecil, of this county. The other is an
uncle, we believe. They have a chain
of ? stores, one in each of towns of
Crowd), Cleburn, and Hnmlin, Tex?
as and Cccil-Blair Co., Cecil-Ramsel
Co., and Cecil-Holt Co., in Chillicotho,
Mart, Texas and Olustce, Oklahoma,
respectively. The boys are evidently
making good as Tazewell boys usual?
ly do. We are always glad to give
the boys a boost, besides keeping them
and their old home friends and rela?
tives in touch through the columns of
the old paper.
PINCHED.
The recent spell of bad weather
following another one ubout as bad,
pinched quite severely, but luckily did
not last long. A number of people
were caught short of provisions and
fuel. When times are good?weather
favorable and employment easy to
obtain, some folks seem to forget
that the "rainy day" is coming, and
fail to provide for it. Like the grass
hopper that sang all the summer,
they are forced to want when winter
comes. The past twelve months have
been unusually favorable for out?
door work, with only now and then a
short interval when there was noth?
ing doing outside. As a rule the en?
tire population of the town have come
through the winter in fine condition.
The same with the stock. Feed has
been plentiful and the winter mild.
This recent cold spell was severe on
young lambs, thousands of which
came during the month of February,
and nre still coming. Perbans there
has been less "pinching" the past
winter than for any previous winter
for years past, and need not have
been any nt all.

(Editorial.)
The passage of the Witten-Sliu
male bill gives genuine satisfaction
here, as does also the tlafont of the
Co-ordinate College bill.
The daughters of the rich men,
who want a higher education will be
welcomed into Hie COllogOS und r.cmi
mirios of other Stales nearby if there
aii' none of sufficiently high grade in
Ibis stale. Nine of ten girls who go
lo colleges from the High Schools go
to donontiuntionul schools. If (be
state has money to spend, "t<> throw
ut birds," give if to the poor, starv?
ing free schools of the Stale.
"THE PEP" HEAT US TO IT.
Tin? February issue of the High
School paper, "'file Pep," is just out.
The Pep has beaten us to if. If bus
HUCCCcdcd in getting a number of the
merchants in ibis community to do a
little advertising. The lesson taught,
would seem to be "start a school jour?
nal; tile number of copies issueil
makes no difference. Or were the
"boys" just aiming (o l|clp a good
CUUBO along?
POC?I?NT?S
"WET" 30 YEARS
Council Now Has Iii? .loh of
Providing Funds to Make up
Loss of Taxes From The
Saloons.
Pocabonlas, Va., Mar. 8.?Pocahon
tas dry after May 1st?that sounds
strange, but the passage by the SUite
Senate yesterday of the Wittcn-Shll
mnte amendment will make it u reali?
ty, if signed by Goovrnor Stuart,
which be will undoubtedly do. The
town bus been under license for nearly
thirty years, und it will lake some
time for Hie readjustment to take
place nfter Mw? 1. There are some
problems in financing for the town
to solve, as they will not be able to
figure on receipts from licpior license
any more. The same problem con?
fronts them now that many a town
in the United States has had to grap?
ple with in the last few years, as the
progress of temperance under the di?
rection of the anti-saloon league has
been marvelous. The present instance
of course hud nothing to do with the
anti-saloon league, in fact the anli
snloon league bad nothing to do with
it. As to the causes that brought it
ubout the writer is not familiar, llio
we all know that the Wilten-Shumale
bill did the work.
Russian Killed.
Angelo Onicks, a Russian, was kill?
ed at the tunnel between here and
Blusotono on Saturday night, niii?
John Canoko is in jail here chnrged
wiht the crime. They hud started to
Bluestone to catch No. 17. About
an hour later John Canckc returned
and reported to the authorities that
they had been held up by two negroes
and that his companion had been shot.
The police went to owrk on the case
and on sufficient information proceed?
ed to arrest Cnnckc. Both mon were
employed by the Lick Branch Col?
liery at Switchback.
A PLAIN STATEMENT TO THE
READERS OF THIS PAPER.
We lose money on every subscrip?
tion wo enrrv now, if unpaid for a
year. The white paper on which the
News is printed has advanced from
2 l-2c a pound f. o. h. Tazewell, to
3 1-2 cents a pound f. o. b. Cincin?
nati. It would pay us to drop every
unpaid subscripiton on our list rath?
er than to carry them on credit. But
we wont do this until forced or re?
quested to do so. We want more in?
stead of fewer subscribers, and trust
our renders will appreciate the situa?
tion and pav up ut once.
I The label on your paper carries the
date of the expiration of your sub
i scription. Please examine it right
now, while you have the paper in your
lands, and govern yourself accord?
ingly. We are not complaining, only
i slat in it facts.

Legislature Which Will Adjourn
This Week, Passed Many
Needel Laws ? Co-ordinate
College Hill Defeated.
Mr. Editor: The Legislature, which
adjouTns this week has hail u mem?
orable session.
It was "stormy" in many ways, ami
remarkable.
Many important bills wore passed,
and a number Introduced that wero
not passed, which wore of special im?
portance. The most notable action of
the General Assembly was the pas?
sage of the Mapp bill, which will
make (he State thy, lacking a quart,
on November 1st, next. How this now
law will alToct such cities as Richmond
Norfolk. Petersburg, Ronuoko and
some others, remains to be seen. In all
those cities ami throughout the Stalo
public sentiment favors strict udher
nnco to (ho provisions of the law.
Nobody OXpecls that then' will not bo
drinking and drunkenness still. The
Mapp bill proposes only to slop thu
legal sale of liquor in the State ox
icept for medical purposes, and under
certain restrictions as much as one
quart is allowed each adult in the
Stale per mouth. No doubt the next,
legislature will wipe out this conces?
sion and begin with a clean tdittu.
The passage of the Witten-Shumate
bill, Walch makes l'ocnhoulna dry as
it bone six months in advance of the
whole slate, was an unexpected and
SonUltional measure. Mr. Witten slip?
ped up on the boys ami caught 'em
napping.
There was a strenous. hard light,
made for and against I ho niOUBUro.
Not ii few COnclollliOUH citizens took
the ground that the measure was un?
fair, that the enabling act provided
for the closing of the .saloons on No?
vember 1st. ami that, this provlal m
should be carried out. A number of
people who voted for ihe enabling
act last yonr foughl the Witten bill,
ami did all they could to give the >a
iooiih of I'ocnhontiiH six months longer
.ease id' life. To no purpose, however
was all this offorl in favor of the open
saloon.", in I'ocahonlns. And I'ocilhoil
las, w hich baa Ins II a stench in the
nostrils of the citizens of two states
lor years, will now soon enter upon
a new era. Think of it! t'OCIlllOlltus
without a saloon, What uffect this
act. will have upon the business of Hto
little city, judging from the oxpori
eine of Itllicllolfl and other cities and
towns in West Virginia is plain. There
will be bettor conditions all around.
The great conl companies will con?
tinue to mine coal, and the miners
will have more money to spend for
groceries and clothing for their fam?
ilies and saloon keepers ami others
who have grown rich indirectly
through the truffle in souls and hu?
man misery will no longer bank blood
money, and the sidewalks of the
streets will be laid in honest concrete
instead id' blood.
A measure of much importance de?
feated, was the bill to establish in
Chariot lesvillo, in collection with thu
University. As this measure fortu?
nately I'ailed, nothing more need be
said about it now. It will bob up
again.
It. wan notienhtc, that for once the
Legislature ditl not "jump on the rail?
roads" to any alarming extent, Thu
railroads furnish a ready source of
attack when legislators run out of
something to talk about anil light.
Some town and city councils like
wine,
Something was started by a bill of?
fered providing for a through ex?
amination into the expenses of carry?
ing on the Stale Government. The
committee should and will, no doubt,
make recommendations fur a reduc?
tion of expenses along several lines.
There are numerous commisions, so?
cieties, nssistuilts et cetera, which
could be disposed with. Thu exorbit?
ant salaries paid county and stale of?
ficers, the attaches of thu school
boards and committees etc., amount?
ing to $400,000, is simply outrageous.
The salaries paid treasurers, runing
from $0,000 to 12 ami $10,000 could
be cut. down without hurting any body.
The Remitter Hill.
A bill was offorcd and passed au?
thorizing the Examiner of Records,
who gets a salary of !f..l,000, lo go no
further back than 1012, in assessing
for luxes due on unlisted property.
The examiner found that Thos. K.
Ryan, the multi-millionair, owetl back
taxes on several million dollars worth
of property for years, in Alberrnarle
county, and his attorneys "started
something" which resulted in the Tax
Remitter bill. This bill and its provi?
sions, we believe, applies only to state
taxes.
Much interest him CchUJed in tho
appointment of a prohibition com?
missioner for the State. There are
only two candidates for tho office
now?Judge J, H. Stuart, of Roanoke
anil Rev. Sidney Peters, according to
the statements made yesterday in the
Richmond papers. It is said thu ap?
pointment will be mittle today.
