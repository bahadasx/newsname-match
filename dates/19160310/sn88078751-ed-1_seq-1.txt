German Contention That British Mer
chantmen Are Not Armed For De
fensive but For Offensive Furposes
to Be Taken Up by the State De
partment Berlin's Latest Memor
andum In Lansing's Hands.
Washington, March 9. The United
States government, it was learned on
blgh authority, is considering the ad
visability of questioning the charac
ter of armament used on British mer
chantmen. Such action. If taken, will be based
tn the nature of the "secret orders
issued by the British admiralty to
English merchantmen, directing them
to fire on German and Austrian sub
marines on sight.
While no decision has been report
ed yet, it is said that close examina
tion of these orders, together with
other data submitted by the German
government in the appendices to tho
German submarine declaration of
March 1, has Impressed administra
tion officials to some extent with the
leasonableness of tho German conten
tion that the British merchantmen
are not armed for defensive but for
offensive purposes.
Because of this impression it is the
intention of the state department to
fcubmit tho appendices to the British
government for verification and com
ment. Should the impression be con
firmed, it is probable the United
States will send a formal note to the
British government notifying it that
from the American standpoint British
merchant vessels operating under
these "secret orders" can not properly
be regarded as armed for defense.
The purpose of the United States in
seeking a final determination ot the
otatus of British merchantmen, it was
explained, was not to enable' the ad
ministration to decide whether or not
to warn Americans off armed belliger
ent merchant ships, but in order to
safeguard itself from violations of the
reutrality laws of the United States
prohibiting offensively armed ships of
a belligerent nation from
clearing
from an American port as a peaceful
ship of trade.
Count Von Bernstorff handed Spcre
tary Lansing a formal memorandum
which, after reviewing the events
leading up to Germany's recent deci
sion to treat armed merchant ships
as auxiliary cruisers, conceded that
existing Internationa" law does not
regulate the use of submarines, indi
cated a willingness to conduct under
bea warfare in accordance with the
law prevailing at the outbreak of the
war, providing Great Britain and her
allies would regard the same laws,
ind expressed the hope that the peo
ple of thp United States, remember
ing the long-existing friendly rela
tions between the two nations, would
p.ppreciate the German position.

TO REASSURE
THE COUNTRY
Senator Presents Views Of
The President
Stone States Wilson Does Not
Look For War With Germany.
MAKES STATEMENT IN SENATE
Chairman of Foreign Relations Com
mittee Takes Pains to Say He Had
Discussed the Subject With tn
President Would Shut Off Dlscu
ion (n the Senate of the Adminis
tration's Foreign Policy.
Washington, March 9. A statement
designed to reassure the country that
President Wilson does not look for
war with Germany was made in the
senate by Senator William J. Stone
of Missouri, chairman of the commit
tee on foreign relations.
In a speech that forced votes In con
gress on the armed merchantman Is
sue, Senator Gore declared a week
ago that President Wilson had told
Senator Stone and others that if a
German submarine again fired on a
belligerent merchantman and Ameri
un lives were lost as a result, war
with Germany would undoubtedly fol
low. It was this statement by Mr.
Gore that brought to a head the dis
pute between congress and the presi
dent over Mr. Wilson's foreign policy.
In his statement to the senate Sen
ator Stone made this observation: r
am sure I will not offend If I say that
so far from the president desiring to
involve the country in this disastrous
European war, his supreme wish Is tc
avoid this calamity."
A good deal of significance was at
tached to Mr. Stone's statement, in
view olMhe fact that it was obviously
Inspired by the White House. Chair
man Stone took pains to say that he
had discussed the subject with the
president. He added that he had
cecided to defer for a time the de
livery of a speech he had prepared on
the armed merchantman issue. Mr.
j stone also indicated that he is desir
ous of shutting off discussion of the
administration's foreign policy.
Address Postponed.
Aside from the remarks made by
Mr. Stone there was no reference in
the senate debate to the armed mer
chantmen dispute. Senator LaFoIletle
cf Wisconsin, who was scheduled to
speak, postponed his address until
later in the week
As an aftermath of the spectacular
struggle to table the MoLemore reso
I lution the Democrats of the house

has decided to issue a wnrnlng. Hep
resnntative Kiston of California, to
whom the Innuirj was ad lressed, ex
