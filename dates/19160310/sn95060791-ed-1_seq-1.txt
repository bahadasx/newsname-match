Field Notes from the Office of the
County Engineer
Contracts for a large amount
of road work will be awarded
within the next week. These
cover sections in all parts of the
county.
Flood waters from the melting
snows in the mountains still con
tinue to delay necessary bridge
and road work in the southern
part. Temporary road conditions
in other parts are excellent.
With the facilities of the new
road equipment ordered purchas
ed at the March meeting of the
board of supervisors the engi
neer is anticipating improve
ments in road construction which
could never before be realized.
The ownership of a latest im
proved "45"-All-Caterpillar-
Tractor and a double blade heavy
road machine with road roller
attached, places Navajo County
in the front rank with the coun
ties of the State who have here
tofore been the leaders in econo
mical road work.
The State concrete bridge
across the Little Colorado River
five miles east of Holbrook will
be ready to carry travel during
the first part of April. This is
the best, probably the longest
Lutin arch in the State, and,
like all work done by the state
forces, although expensive, is of
a permanence and solidity out
little adopted in county work and
is good for all time to come.
If your road trouble matters
are adressed directly to this office
they will receive prompt atten
tion. Charles E. Perkins,
County Engineer.
Supervisors in Session
The regular monthly meeting
of the board of supervisors was
held last Monday in the board
room in Holbrook. Outside of
the routine business considerable
business of importance was trans
acted, a night session being
necessary to finish it.
The county engineer was
authorized to purchase road
machinery from the companies
that had submitted lowest bids
in response to the published in
vitation for bids. The details of
these purchases are given in
another column under the head
ing of notes from the county
engineer's office.
The clerk of the board was
authorized to advertise for sale
the $63, C00 worth of bonds re
cently voted for bridge purposes.
This advertisement appears in
another column of this paper.
J. J. Shumway was granted
a franchise to erect and operate
an electric light and power plant
for supplying ght and power to
the towns of Snowflake, Taylor
and Shumway.
Distinction Without A Difference
In the issue of The News of
February 25, under the head of
"Business in Justice Court", the
statement was made that "Sam
Smith plead guilty to the chargt
of petty larcency and was sen
tenced to 15 days in jail, the
complaining witness being Wm.
Wooster. Judge Boyer suspend
ed the sentence."
Mr. Smith asks that the state
ment that he plead guilty be cor
rected. The record of the court
shows that he did not plead guil
ty; he was -adjudged guilty by
the court upon evidence submitt
ed. Otherwise the published ac
count of the proceeding is cor
rect. Dodge Cars Used By Police
The police department of
Rochester. N. Y., has put the
Dodge Brothers motor cars in
service for general use in the
department. The choice of cars
was made after exhaustive tests
extending over several weeks in
which careful records were kept
of the maintenance costs and al
so of the general performance
of the cars. Others are to be
added to the fleet.
The cars are in use at the
various poliee stations 24 hours
each day. each car has three
drivers, who work in eight hour
shifts. They are used by the
detectives in answering hurry
calls, racing to fires, etc.
Rank Foolishness.
You occasionally see it stated
that colds do not result from cold
weather. That is rank foolish
ness. Were it true colds would
be as prevalent in midsummer as
in midwinter. The microbe that
causes colds flourishes in damp,
cold weather. To get rid of a
cold take Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy. It is effectual and it is
highly recommended by peoele
who have used it for many years
as occasion required, and know
its real value. Obtainable every
where. Big Land Selections
The Arizona Republican states
that the largest selection of land
ever made by the state land de
partment in cne day was filed on
Tuesday. The selections com
prise in all 100,753.74 acres, and
is mostly in the Altar valley, in
Pima county. The filing fees
alone amounted to $636.
The land is bounded by the
newly set aside Papago reserva
tion on the east. It will be rent
ed for a period of five years, at
the rate of three cents per acre
per annum. After that time has
passed, the land will be sold and
the money applied to the follow
ing grants: University, legisla
tive, executive, judicial, peniten
tiary, insane asylum, asylum for
i deaf and dumb, normal schools.
charitable, penal and reform in
stitutions, agricultural and me
chanical schools, mining school
and military institutes.
The money to be derived from
the sale of 2.880 acres will go to
Cochise, Maricopa and Graham
counties to be applied on the
payment of bonds.
Julius Wetzler has a force
of men at work laying ce
ment walks in the west part
of town. Mr. Wetzler is
having walks laid in front of
some of his own property,
and is contracting for work
from others. Walks have
been laid for L. Cadwell, J.
W. Richards and Cyrus Mc
Cleve. J. S. Hulet and Geo.
W. Hennessey have also
made contracts for walks.
Good work is being done and
the price is very reasonable.
Many other property owners
will probably take advant
age of the opportunity to
have walks put in while Mr.
Wetzler's outfit is on the job.

SPECIAL CORRESPONDENCE
Six delegates to represent Arizona at the national democratic convention
in St. Louis next June, were chosen by the state central committee, which
met in Phosnlx last Saturday, and instructed to vote as a unit for Woodrow
Wilson. Resolutions endorsing the national administration, pledging the
support of the delegates to Wilson and pronouncing Thomas P. Marshal: the
choice of the party in Arizona for vice-president, were adopted unanimously.
After a fight the resolutions committee was instructed to deal with only
national af'airs and not to mention the situation within the state.
Fred T. Coltsr, of Apache county, was made national committeeman.
He defeated Reese M. Ling, who has been national committeeman for the
last four years, by a vote of 39 to 28.
The state was divided into six districts. The state committeemen
from each district selected a delegate and an alternate, who were later ap
proved by the entire committee. Following is the complete :ist of delegates
ana alternates: Apacne. Navajo, Coconino: George Babbitt, Flagstaff: R.
C. Cressweli, Winslow, alternate. Maricopa, Pinal: M. J. Dougherty, Mesa;

Fifteen Arizona members of the National Equal Suffrage Union appeared
before the committee and secured the adoption of a resolution endorsing the
Susan B. Anthony constitutional amendment for the total enfranchisement
of women.
Instructions to initiate a number of laws to make Arizona even "dryer"
'hn it is were given the executive committee of the Arizona Temperance
federation at the annual meeting of that organization, held in Phoenix. The
luestlon of whether a constitutional amendment prohibiting the persona'
use of liouor should be initfated was left with the committee. I was quite
evident that the delegates were widely divided on the advisability of attempt
ing to secure the adontion of such a rigid amendment.
The laws the committee was directed to initiate are for the following
purposes:
Prohibiting the intra-state shipment of intoxicants.
Reouiring the destruction of liquor seized bv peace officers.
Making possession of a government liquor license prima facie evidence
of law violation.
Declaring any place where liquor is sold or given away a pub'ic nuisance
and closlne It for one year.
Prohibiting liquor advertising in newspapers and moving picture shows
or by any other medium.
Memorials were adooted asking congress to amend the Webb-Kenyon
act so as to make it illegal to ship liouor into any dry territory, and to nasa
nending bills making the District of Columbia and Hawaiian islands prohibi
tion territory.
Resolutions were adopted praising Arizona offlcprs for their efforts to
enforce prohibition, censurin federal officers for failure to prosecute per
sons who have sold 'lquor without government licenses, and demanding that
the next legislature enact any laws that may be necessary to make prohibi
tion effective.
The followine officers were elected for the ensuing year: President,
Thomas K. Marshall. Tucson: vice-president, B. W. Getsinger, Phoenix;
treasurer, J. O. Sexson. Phoenix: ten eral secretary, C. J. Banks, Phoenix;
field secretary Grady Gammage. Tucson.

W. W. Wilkinson. Miss Marion Camobell. Rev. Ray C. Harker. L. W. Cog
gins, D. F. Jantzen. E. D. Raley. Harry Blair, Dr. H. A. Hughes, Mrs.
Imogene LaCbance. Phoenix: J. W. LfiSueur. M"sa- Peter T. Robertson.
Yuma: B. Brttton Oottsbereer Miami- Dav'd K. TJdall. St. Johns: Rudolph r
"Ctich'er, Glendale: Mose Drachman, Tucson.
On the same day that the Temperance, federation met, attorneys for all
railroads doing business In Arizona gathered 'n Phoenix to discuss the "per-,
sonal use" decision of the supreme court. The representatives nf the three
railroad systems that carv interstate fre'eht into Arizona decided that Honor
shipments for points w'thin this state would not be accepted. They agreed
that such transportation would be legal but In each case the transporting
; road mlsrht have to prove that the consienee intended to use the liquor for
; no Illegal purpose. Even If the consienee s'ened an affidavit that he did
not intend to transgress the law, the ra-'lroad would not be protected In case
ne utilized the 'touor for other than persona1 use.

Members of the "initiation association," a new organization composed of
persons interested in the return of the saloon under rigid restrictions, met
in Phoenix and decided to Initiate an amendment to carry out their ideas.
The exact form of the amendment wi'l be decided at a future meeting. It
is not their plan to conduct any campaign for its adoption.
Little interest was taken in the Phoenix city primary election. Only 4900
voters took the trouble to register and only 3K60 went to the Tolls. The
nominees for mayor are Peter Corpstein and George V. Young, incumbent.
Corpstein receiving 1479 votes to Young'? 1021. Frank Woods was elected
to the commission as he received more than half the votes cast at the pri
maries. Claude W. Cisney and James A. Jones were nominated for the
other commisslonership.
The plan of the board of control to erect a building on the cap√≠tol
grounds for the accommodation of the supreme court and attorney general
has been abandoned, as Attorney General Wiley Jones says that there is no
fund avail ab"e for that purpose.
Jones has also advised the board that there is no law under which Wil
liam Faltin can be removed from the asylum for 'the insane to the peniten
tiary. Faltin was convicted of murder in Maricopa county but his execu
tion was halted when a jury in the Pinal county superior court pronounced
him insane . The superintendent of the asylum is afraid that he will escape
from that Institution, which has no barred cells, and wanted to send him
back to the penitentiary for safe keeping. Three extra guards axe em
ployed to watch him night and day. The board has advised the superin
tendent to put up an iron cage and take any other steps necessary to prevent
Fal tin's escape.
