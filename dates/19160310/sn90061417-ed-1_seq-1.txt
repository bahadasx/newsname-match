The 75th Sprint Term of Holt's

I Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Zachman Cele
brate Their Golden
Weddln. Day.
Truth Is stranger tlmn fiction, only
becnuso more nniaiing. Fiction writ
ton by the mnster bund Inspires to
plenum' l'.v the w of Imaginative
power In development of situation
not renl. hut which the nrt of the
nitlst has persuaded us might not be
impo-siblo when real life parallels
..,, .il.ii,.. nnrrnteil In LMrnt lletlo'i.
The surprise grcnter because nf
wliut wo Know as rcany. xccunniii;'
lv. trulli is similiter than llctloii
when it Is seen l equal lictlon, not
liecuuse it Is stranger in essence, inn
inlv lixmii.e it Is Inllll.
When we lead In "lllink House" if
the lone drawn out nut In the chnn-
i v i-mirl for ttiis.cssinn of the John
Dice i-stale. we marvel lit the thill
of Dickon even while we nssuie our
selves thai Mich delays and such di
siiinlhm of property rouM never
hnve hern In unv eouit In any civil
Iti.I Intnl. When lllml llldirnictll Wits
rcndcicil the estate was found to
have heen swallowed up in the fees
nnd costs of several generation. Hut
rei'pntlv n llnal Judgment was render'
nl In a lltliration between St. I.ouls
lltiirnnts which Itcgnn 2fi years ngn,
The nriginnl suit was for $;.().IK)(). The
linnl Judgment was for $.'1,000, which
will not he enough to pay aceumu
lated costs nnd lawyer lees. Truth
Is similiter than lictlon herntise of the
nurnnce it olTels, sometimes, that
there Is nnthlnir that n tiowerful im
aginative mind can Imagine people
doing In lictlon which will not he done
I iv some or us In real Hie.
