The midnight .statement issued hour?
later than the German report, says:
"Fast of the Meuse the Germans made
numerous attacks on our front from
iJouaumont to Vaux. At the exit from
the village of Pouaumont their attack
was broken l?y our infantry and artil
lery tire. Furious assaults against the
village of Vattx were likewise repulsed,
with heavy losses to the enemy.
"Finally, the 'let mans launched

of the ri'Jfse. which Is surmounted by
Fort Vaux. violent attacks in solid
formation, which were repulsed, with
i enormous losses to the enemy inflicted
by our barrier tire."

the eyes of the world for the moment

Here, during the day. French and

The Merlin War Oflice reports.
"West of the Mouse we were occu

Shocked indignation occasioned by
news of Villa's outrage was quickly
succeeded b\ undisguised satisfaction
in oilicial circles over the knowledge
that, after three years of patient for
bearance, l.'nited States troops actually
; were on Mexican soil to avenge th*
' death of their comrades and bring to
justice the outlaws whoso depredatious
I have terrorized Americans on both

anxious interest in ofllcial circles.

Ui:iN TO CATC'If BANDITS
I While no formal word of the policy
' of the administration was given out.
' it was reliably stated that the army
would be given free rein to catch the
bandits if possible. It was not con
sidered in administration circles that
jt'oloncl Slocum's act in any sense con
stituted .in invasion of Mexico, a policy
; which -the administration has opposed
I in ihe past, and will continue to oppose.
Forma My there is no authority for
the presence of the American troops
in Mexico. In fact, the patrols along
the border have from the beginning of
the disorders there been under orders
not to cross under any conditions. If
the provocation had not been so great,
the otiieeis responsible for the action
of lo-tluj v. oil Id face court-martial.
Suggestions that t'olonel Slocum, in
command at Columbus, might be court
martialed. however, were seouto by
"onie ollicials. while at the War De
partment itself the subject was not
discussed.
Newton I>. Maker, who became Secre
tary of War to day, conferred over the
.situation with President Wilson to
nigbt. Three hours later Mr. Maker
said ttii orders had hreii sent for the
recall of the American soldiers.
Major-i JeiK.ra I Scott, chief of Staff,
telegraphed < ciieral l-'unston, at Fort
