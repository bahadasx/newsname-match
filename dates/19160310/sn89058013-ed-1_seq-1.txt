KIND WORDS OF
APPRECIATION
The following reply to Grand
Master Hisey was delivered by
Miss Marie Pafford at the session
of the Masonic grand lodge at
Nashville in January. Miss Paf
ford, who is a daughter of the late
0. N. Pafford of Eva City, is only
14, and is very bright for one of
berage. She with her mother and
four other children have beeu Iiv-
y trig at the Masonic home near
- Nashville since (he death of Mr.
Pafford. Miss Pafford is a grand,
daughter of James Meyers and
niece of Noah Melton' of Eva City,
tl'he reply follows:,
A great grand master you are to
have such a retinue and to have
filled your high station with so
much patience aud charity for tbe
" shortcomings of many whom you
Lave honored by your dignity,
presence and advice. This coming
of the grand master with so many
brethreu each year is an event of
much concern to us, for whom you
have so arduously labored through-
' out the year, aud whose welfare aud
praise you have more or less spok
en. Would that we could again
catch up the threads of time that
we, unintentionally, wasted and
bind them closely to our lives to
build anew our resolves, our prom
ises and ambitions, that we might
the more and better impress you
that we are grateful children, in
dustrious and studious children.
We prefer not to mislead you but
. to frankly admit that we have not
grown bo fast as we wish, nor have
we fulfilled perhaps all expecta
tions, but we crave your pardon,
most noble grand master, for our
' imperfections. -
During the year many pleasures
have come to us, not the least of
which, besides our happy school
days, was the great picnic of July
4, when thousands came to look
upon the grand home and get ac
quainted with us. Then came va
cation, when many of us went back
to our old homes and trod again
the footpaths of our fathers and
And saw their lonely graves? but,
grand master, you realize that we
are today differently situated from
the last reception we gave you.
Then we welcomed you from the
great steps of our home, the chilly
winds whisking through our wraps
mud chilling our frames. Today
we can receive you more pleasantly
and happily. ;
v We greet yon beneath the roof
of this mighty house you come to
- dedicate to the sacred keeping of
the aged and infirm. In these
beautiful rooms are samples of our
needlework, carpentry and other
evidences of our progress and in
dustry. They do well to carry the
aspirations of youth to the more
experienced and deft hands of age
and usefulness for inspection and
appreciation, and will doubtless
receive commendation. But, dear
grand master, there is another'
thought welling up as we gather
here today, and that is the glorious
blending of -the various types of
. sympathy that arouse ; human
hearts. First, the orphan child,
homeless and friendless, stowed
away in cribs and rooms made
. . ready by the good brother Masons,
then the widow in her tears, lead
- ' ing her fatherless children to a
" epacious room which becomes their
home with all its comforts. See
yonder modest cottage with its big
windows, but a sorrowful page it
, blots from' your history, for old
widowhood there rests and waits
its final summons. , Here amid this
splendor, buttressed and toweriug
in its might, you make a retreat, a
home for the limping, weary and
aged Mason to gladden his heart
and lay him down th peace and
quiet at the end of his journey.
Childhood! Widowhood! Old
Womaul Old Mason! Say your
prayers all together and let not
your hearts be troubled! Around
you aud about you gather this ar
ray of youi brethreu aud you feel
the thrill of contentment aud joy
that knows no bound. Not a sun
set here but leaves a vesper song
not a sunrise but it paints for us a
glory on the wide ocean of time
ud bids us be men, be women,
that our hearts be never thralled
save for the good of mankind and
the glory of God.
Like the wings of the morning
laying its kiss upon crag and crest,
crevice and flower, your splendid
words, your kindly faces and honest
handshakes bring us heart glows
that will long beat in our breasts
and exalt our lives.'
We could but welcome you, ) We
can but tell you that we are better
for your coming and we pledge
again another year to go cheerfully
about our tasks, and thus write for
you auother page in the life of our
good home. And as we thank you
and welcome you, may we modestly
greet dear Deputy Grand Master
Charles Barham, whose face we
know and whose words we recall,
spoken over there at the corner
stone laying of Al Menah Dormi
tory. . We lay you both up, and all
these children, in our hearts for
safe keeping and give you three
cheers from the children of the
home. ;'; V: "v , '
