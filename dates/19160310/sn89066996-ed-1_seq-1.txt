OUR VISIT
A Splendid Little City Populated by
1,000 Good Citizens
Che Times editor, wife and daughed at a cost of $18,000. There they
tier visited Bismarck Monday to have an efficient corps of seven teach
'reak in" an acquaintance with the ers. who are directing the minds of
citizens of that community. It was
our initial visit to that place, and our
acquaintance there was limited to a
slight acquaintance with two or three
citizens. But from the moment we
arrived it seems that we found no
strangers, as everyone we met was
so courteous and obliging, willing and
even anxious, it seemed, to render us
aay service in their power. Our first
impressions, therefore, were that we
had never before been thrown among
more courteous and obliging human
beings. And during our Stay, until
noon Tuesday, the impression con
' inued to grow that we were "in the
hands of our friends."
We found Bismarck to be a well
built town, with a substantial busi
ness district which indicated consid
erable more than 1,000 population,
which, we were informed, a recent cen
sus gives it. We stopped at the Bis
marck Hotel, a splendid hostelry,
which is most efficiently managed by
Mrs. Eaton, who is always ready to
anticipate the wants of her patrons,
and under her efficient management
this house holds the reputation of be
ing one of the most desirable homes
for the traveling public to be found
outside of the larger cities.
In meeting with the people on the
streets and in the business houses we
were more deeply impressed with the
idea with which we were imbued on
arrival, that we had never been thrown
among a more clever class of citizens.
Everyone appeared to be pleased to
meet us, and even to devote their time
to showing us over their little city.
They proved themselves to be a home,
loving people, ever ready and willing
to exhibit those things which their
combined efforts had made possible.
One of the things in which they
take especial pride is their new pub
lic school building, recently complet-

about 300 pupils, under the superin
tendency of Prof. G. W. Signer, who
is proving himself a most capable ed
ucator. We had the pleasure of go
ing through this building, which is
thoroughly modern throughout, being
two stories, and basement, with
twelve large rooms, well lighted and
thoroughly ventilated, steam heat,
electric lights and every detail in ar
rangement perfect. Graduation from
this school entitles the pupil to en.
trance into the State University.
Our visit to Bismarck was of great
est pleasure to the editor and family,
which we hope to be able to repeat
at some not distant day.
DEATH OF GOOD NEGRO
Gene Sutherland, colored, who for
many years has been a valuable and
trusted -employe in Jacob Helber's
Hardware establishment, died Wednes
day morning at 6 o'clock at his home
in this city.
Gene's death is mourned by all who
knew him, as he was one of those
splendid negroes, now becoming al
together too rare, who knew his place
and apparently had no desire to work
out of it. Certain it is that he never
indicated any desire to force himself
on anyone. He was loved and re
spected by all who knew him at his
real worth, and his employer would as
soon place Gene as guard over his
money box as he would anyone else
in his employ. He was indeed a cred
it and an honor to his race. Peace
to his ashes.
SIX COWS BRING $950
Sheriff J. C. Williams sold to John
Swink last Monday six Whiteface
Hereford cows for $950, an average
of $158,33 1-3 a head, which shows
that it pays to raise good stock.
DISASTROUS FIRE
DISFIGURES DESLOGE
Finest Business Block Reduced to Ashes
Last Friday Night
Last Friday night as about 11
o'clock fire started in the Florence
business block, in Desloge, which ter
minated in a severe blight to that en
terprising town. While turning out
the lights in the large department
store of the Florence estate, which
was lighted by the S. P. gasoline sys
tem, there was an explosion, probab
ly caused by too great pressure, and
from such a start the flames quickly
spread until they enveloped the en
tire store, which was completely de
stroyed, both building and contents.
This immense store building, more
than 100 feet square, was occupied
by a dry goods department, hardware
and furniture, and drugs, the entire
establishment being under the man
agement of Kelly Robertson. The
building was two-story, well built
brick, and the second floor was fitted
up as a room, where several different
-ecret orders held meetings. Just
east of this block was another two-
story building, which was occupied by

Lectured Wednesday
Other Speakers.
For the first time in the history of
our country, or of the world, a week
has been set apart for the baby our
greatest asset and our greatest re
sponsibility. "One reason for Baby
Week t.i to jolt us out of our smug
ness and set us to work. The other
reason is to teach the art of caring
for babies."
The Children's Bureau at Washing
ton, of which Miss Julia Lathrop is
the head, asked that this week, March
4-11, be set aside for this purpose,
and through the co-operation of the
General Federation of Women's Clubs
and the American Medical Associa
tion the movement became national.
Farmington Catches the Spirit
Through the efforts of the club wo
men, ably seconded by the medical
association, churches, schools and cit
izens, Farmington has made her first
Baby Week a success.
The Mayor, Hon. E. J. McKinney,
issued a letter asking the co-operation
of the town people in the move
ment. This was read from most of tho
pulpits Sunday morning, and was giv
en a prominent place in the newspa
pers. On Saturday, March 4, 120 flags
were distributed throughout the city,
so that every home where there is a
baby under three years of age, has
had a flag flying at its door during
the week. The Boy Scouts deserve
great praise for their work in distri
buting and nailing up the flags.
On Sunday, March 5, all the Sun
day schools had special exercises ap
propriate to the occasion songs and
recitations by the primary classes, and
talks by superintendents and pastors.
In the Southern Methodist Church
the exercises were especially interest
ing. The mothers and babies of the
church were invited, and cards bearing
the names of the infants on the cra
dle roll were tied with appropriate
colors to a cradle arranged in the
front of the church. Most of the
j churches recognized the day in some
way, many of the pastors devoting
their sermon to the subject.
Appropriate exercises were held in
the different schools on one day of
the week, and on Thursday afternoon
a committee of ladies spoke to the
Parents-Teachers Association of
Douglas school.
the
Wednesday's Program
On Wednesday afternoon a large
audience assembled in the Monarch
and enjoyed the program arranged
for the occasion. Miss Hildegarde
Kneeland of Vassar College and Col
umbia University, New York, gave a
most interesting and able lecture on
tho "Care of the Baby," touching on
all phases of the lief of the infant,
bathing, feeding and clothing. Dr.
G. L. Watkins of Farmington follow
ed with a talk on artificial foods for
Dr. Graneau as an office and residence,
which was also totally destroyed, as
was also a single-story building fur
ther to the east, which was occu
pied by a barber and shoe-maker.
The Florence stores were perhaps
the largest and best in Desloge, and
their crumbling to ashes leaves a
hideous scar for the time being in
that prosperous community. But this
scar will soon be eradicated, as The
Times has been informed that prepa
rations are already in progress for
rebuilding the Florence black. The
Florence estate suffered heavy loss in
this fire, the property lost being
worth at least $40,000, with only ?28,.
000 insurance. But the management
feels t hut. the loss would bo heavier
still if the splendid business of the
firm was sacrificed, and therefore ex
tra efforts will be made to re-open
for business, on the site of the form
er establishment, at the earliest pos
sible time, with probably the same
i lines.
the infant, pointing out the best sub
stitutes for the baby's natural food,
and the various elements the child
must have for proper growth and de
velopment. Dr. Hemingway of Ev -
anston, 111., in an informal talk laid
stress upon the fact that to the wo
men of any community belongs the
task of regulating the public health.
Dr. Hemingway also demonstrated
the baby lungmotor, a small instru
ment used to restore suspended ani
mation in new-born infants.
Miss Louise Lang and Master Joe
Swink gave readings, and Mrs. Nel
son opened and closed the program
with appropriate songs.

I)c Something Yourself for Farming-
ton's Free Public Library
The committee has planned to hold
a Book Shower and Reception next
Tuesday afternoon from 3 to 5 o'clock
in the afternoon and from 7:30 to 9
o'clock in the evening, at the Library
Rooms in the High School building.
The purpose of these receptions is
to receive donations of books or
money. It is desired that everybody
come and bring one or more books as
a gift to the Library. Provision has
been made for everybody to have a
thoroughly good time and get ac
quainted with their Free Public Li
brary.
Nobody doubts the many benefits '
to a town accruing from a library,
and Farmington already has a Li
brary. It is started. Not something
hoped for in the future. It is worthy
of your support, interest, co-operation
and a practical "boost" which
you can give it by attending this
"Book Shower" and bringing along
one or more books or some money
for books.
The library needs you and you need
the Library. Every town worth its
salt has a library and Farmington is
light in line. Your help is required
at once if the Library is to be a sue
cess,
Come to the Book Shower and rtlake
the Library a winner.
The Public Library Board feels that
our citizens have such a vital interest
in the welafre of our children and the
prosperity of the Library, that they
will endeavor to see that only works
of a recognized standard are offered
for the Library. The list of books
published by the Missouri Library
Commission is acceptable and there
are other works not included in that
THE HOUSE ALSO
UPHOLDS PRESIDENT
By Vote of 276 to 142 Tables Resolution
Warning American Citizens Off
Belligerent Merchant Ships
The action of the Senate, as pub
lished on page 2, in sustaining Pres
ident Wilson in his diplomatic ex
changes with Germany over the sub
marine warfare question, was followed
up by the House last Tuesday, when a
resolution of tho Pacifists warning
American citizens not to travel on
belligerent ships of commerce, was
tabled (a quick way of defeating the
resolution and shutting off intermin
able debate) by a vote of 276 to 142.
This resolution, somewhat different
from the Gore resolution defeated in
the Senate, was sponsored by Repre
sentative McLemorc of Texas and
reads as follows:
Resolved, that the House of Rep
resentatives of the Sixty-fourth Con
gress of the United States do, and it
hereby solemnly does, request the
President to warn all American citi
zens, within the borders of the Unit
ed States or in its possessions or else
where, to refrain from traveling on
any and all ships of any and all of
the powers now or in the future at
war, which 'ship or ships shall mount
; guns, whether
such ship be frankly
avowed a part of the naval forces of
the power whose flag it flies or be
called a merchant ship or otherwise,
and whether such gun or guns or
other armament be called "offensive"
or "defensive;" and in case Ameri
can citizens do travel on such armed
belligerent ships they do so at their
own risk.
That whenever the President of the
United States or the Secretary f
State shall come into possession of the
actual memorandum of the German
government, containing photographic
fac-similies of alleged secret instruc
tions issued by the British govern
ment, which alleged secret instruc
tions direct that so-called defensive

possible, be concealed and disguised
when in neutral waters and ports, with
the evident intention to deceive, the
President of the United States or the

government with fac similies of the
alleged secret instructions of the Brit

House, that it and they may be laid
before the House for its full informa

forming its duty and function of
guarding the welfare of the country
and its citizens and for its assistance
in performing its constitutional duty
of advising the President of the Unit

uphold all American rights and to ex

flict where the passions of war are
raging.
The vote to table the resolution
and sustain the President was 276;
against it, 142. Ninety-three Repub

and 33 Democrats voted ugai .st sus
