The abova gentle warning
was clipped 'from the Roswell
Sunday Star and will be much
better understood by the "Dear
Candidates" next day after the
primaries. It will all bo clear
to them then, when they have
been weighed in the ballance
and found wanting."
The plains people have opened
their nyes, and aro alert to tho
nee's and wishes of thir people,
and they aro necessarily uniting
in thi one fight for recognition
and consideration. It It per
tectly fiair and legal, for they
are entitled to their own.
conversation "Sri the vernda", provid
ing, of course, she would not invite the
rest of the pilgrims to join Iw.-r.
"You see," said Hilda, settling her
self gracefully in one of Robert's most
comfortable chairs, "I know that In
side that dark, Interesting old house of
yours, I could find some papers, per
haps diaries, that would tell me more
about Prudence. You ktiow that you
are very seldom here st Riding Hal!,'
and all the rest of the time this won
derful old place Is closed. Well, don't
you think you could let us, the suf-"
fragists of our organization, I mean,'
have the privilege of visiting the bouse:
say one day a week? You know It ls
a sort of shrine to us. It Is where our
patroness lived and died and it was
from this very house that she started
out on her memorable trip to the leg
islature. And another thing I want t
ask, Mr. Riding when we get our lit
tle life of Prudence Riding ready,
won't you let us have your photograph,
as a picturo of the only living de
scendant of our Illustrious heroine?'
Robert gasped and jumped to hi
feet In amazement.
Now, please, Mr. Riding," Hilda
Hoover soothed. "I was almost snr
you wouldn't. I could tell that you
thought you opposed the suffrage just
to look st you." Here again Hilda'
laughed her contagious laugh.
"I'd like to know how you coul
tell," he said. ,
"In the first place, you are a bach
elor past thirty, and every bachelor
rnstt thirty thinks that woman's plac
is in the home. That's because h
hasn't any woman in his home anil
doesn't ever expect to hav. Rut Just
wait. One of these days, Mr. Riding,
you are going to come around Juat ssv
easily ns that." Here, by a graceful
gesture, Hilda Hoover expressed th
case with which a man could bo mold--
ed into a thoroughgoing suffragist la
the hands of a suffragist wlfs.
At that time Robert didn't under
stand why he did it. He didn t Men
remember that ho did It. nut the fact
remains that lie consenteu to having
Hilda Hoover examine the papers of
the Riding family in search tit tn
data needed for her life of Prudenc
Riding. And a good half hour tefor
the time set for the first visit he found
himself pacing the veranda, watch la
hand. It was true, he had to admit
it to himself, that there was something
about Hilda Hoover the contagious
laugh and the teasing smile and tk
eyes that looked at you ono minute a
straight and calm as you please and
the next minute possessed tse witch
ery of a coquette.
"Don't you think," said Hilda, whea
she arrived and had taken her place
in the old library In front of a chest
of papers and dooumeuts that Robert
had opened for her, ' don't you thtak.
that you can take time to go over thess
with me? I don't feel that I am re
sponsible alone. They must be very
precious to you."
In spite of the fact that he had prom
ised to play a round of golf wita a
neighbor that afternoon, Robert re
mained at home. When, after a week
of visits, Hilda Hoover expressed fier
desire to . continue her investigatioa
during another week Robert actually
canceled some important business en
gagements in the city in order not ta
miss her daily visits.
"Anyway," said Robert, after they
had turned the last page of the old
records that proved that Mistress Pru
dence Riding actually did batter dowa '
the doors and that she was indeed a
very militant woman, "I don't blain
her. I should think that this woria
would be better off today if there were
a few more women like her. I dont
mean to boast, but I'm glad to have her
for an ancestress. I like a woniaa
with a mind ot her own."
Robert looked eagerly at the face ot
Hilda Hoover and then gazed up quick
ly to the faded old portrait of Pru
dence above the niautlepiece.
' Thy you Know," he said, "I think you
look a good deal like Prudence. You
are both women aftor my own heart.'
And do you know, Hilda Hoover, I aw
not going to promise to let you hsvs
iny picture in your book because I
don't think it would help the cause.
But'any time you want to have your
picture in that book ,with the words
'Mrs. Robert Riding, the present mis
tress of Riding Hall,' written under it,
it's a go."
