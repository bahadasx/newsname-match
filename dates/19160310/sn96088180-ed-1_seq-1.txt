ereignty." . ' . ;
. The president's declaration Indi
cated Resident Carranxa ' had In
formed this government be was will
ing to have Americans co-operate
with him In ending Villa's banditry.
Secretary of War. Baker refusod a
atatement as to the war department's
plan of action. He Indicated he
might issue a statement later.
"(lot Villa, Demi or Alive" :
, When the cabinet met. several
members were committed to the be -
lief that Amorlca's firBt action should
te to "Get Villa, dead or alive." -
Meanwhile, tension in the house and
aennto Increased. Senators Stono and
Fall Joined In asking the senate to

went had exhausted every effort to
keep from Intervening, and that all
efforts had beon worse than fruitless.
The resolution said the American at
titude only emboldened the bandits
to commit further atrocities. Mc
Cumber's measure waa referred to
tbe senate foreign committee.
Senator Aihurst, In a sensational
peoch, charged that the itate, and
war departments planned not oyer
Ave days ago to remove troops from
the border, and that, despite over five
. months' of lncewant entreaties,, the
. administration had refused to regard
the border situation as dangerous.
Trtmltle Forwnxtcil '
"Time after time." he cried, "1

was forecasted to these departments
as earl aa any human event can be.
"Yet they were to sure nothing
would happen tbat not only did they
refuse to Increase their forces, but
they proposed to remove many of
them, possibly to maneuver or train
with the mllltla at aome aafe place
in the United, Slates." :
He read uVgrama from hla con
stituents ticking hla allegations and
declaring that Arliona towns were
also possibly endangered.
. The aenate met with the air of a
man whose finger la on the trigger,
but who la not quite, ready to lire.
Senator Galllnger was ready to in
troduce a flat declaration of war on
Mexico. Senator Fall had ready , a
resolution calling for an Invading
force of 8.00,000 men. . ' , ;-
Nearly all members had telegrams
hotly demanding summary action.
Most of them were disposed to aee
what the military branches of the
government would do before risking
a aenate outbreak. , , ,, .
Action, Like Vera Crua ,
While It waa not announced, it is
probable that President Wilson will
sond a message to congresa within a
few days outlining his reasons tor to
day's orders. He acted similarly In
ordering the fleet to Vera Crus. Con
gress then Immediately passed a re
solution of approval.
-The American expedition will con
sist chiefly of infantry, with at least
3,000 cavalry, a detachment of field
artillery and several batteries of
mountain guns on pack mules. The
mountain guns are especially adapt-
P)j to the guerilla fighting' which Is
'anticipated south of the Rio Grande,
I ''flying column" of 2.000 men,
I mostly . cavalry, will'' constitute the
'advance force, which is to do the
' active worlt of searching out Villa
'and making tentative plans for the
campaign. V

CRUSH VILLA" IS
ICAII
' Washington, Mar. 10."Crush
Villa," Is the new American slogan,
succeeding the former administra
tion policy "Huerta,must go."
A " complete clean-up .campaign
against Mexican border bandits, espe
cially , Francisco Villa, Is promised,
with fighting for an indefinite length
of time by an American border army
of about 19,000 men.
According to present administra
tion plans, "Intervention" in or "in
vasion" of Mexico has not occurred,
and will not occur.
The Mexican campaign promises to
be merely against banditry. 1 .
The future American policy, how
ever, depends largely on . General
Carranxa.'. J Word from him ; Is ex
pected hourly. Mexican Represen
tative Ellxo Arredondo, here, , indi
cated Carranxa would not object to
United States troops crossing the line
and might welcome American aid In
exterminating Villa.
The administration had 'basis for
a belief that Carranza'a statement
will declare Villa an outlaw against
both the American and Carranxa
'governments, and a common enemy
'of both., , : - ; ' ' .
General Trevlno, Carranxista com
mander in Chihuahua, is reported In
pursuit of the Vllllstas. The report
that Villa was wounded In the Col
umbus light has not been confirmed.
If the government decides only to
wipe out the Columbus raiders, army
men said that possibly not more than
1,000, and certainly not oyer 3,000
or 8,000 soldiers, would be sent Into
Mexico. "
President Wilson's statement re
garding hla Intended course regard
ing banditry along the Mexican bor
der may he issued today the White
House indicated. It Is considered
certain, however, that It will declare
against Intervention. - .".w
Judge Morrow will hear , the testi
mony of Mrs. Wltherspoon and de
cide how much heart balm she should
receive. Then the pretty widow t at
torney plans to go to New York and
garnishee Howard's salary, ; - ,
It was when Howard appeared on
the stago in Portland two years ago
that he proposed, Mrs. Wltherspoon
asserts. She says he made strenuous
love to her and promised to return
promptly and marry her. , )
Howard, In an lutervlew, said he
proposed Jokingly while they were
dining at a down-town cafe. ! He says
ho never made love to her.

Paso, Three Mexican bandits, cap
tured at a nearby ranch, today gave

delighted at tbe prospect of a real
chase after Villa. Colonel Slocum
personally expressed pleasure at the
president's decision. Men-' ot ; tbe

ed orders to advance. Two of the

place. Officers declared It would not

to capture Villa, provided the Car
ranzlstas co-operate. , . r
