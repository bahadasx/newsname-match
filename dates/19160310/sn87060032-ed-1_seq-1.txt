MRS. J. H. BYRLEY
PASSES AWAY
Remains Brought Here
From Atlanta, Ga. for
Interment.
Mrs. May Lock Byrley died at
her home in Atlanta, Ga. Friday,
March 3rd. As was known to
all the friends of the family she
had not been well for a number of
years and rather seriously sick
tor several months.
Mrs. Byrley was the yongest
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Wil
liam Lock, long residents and
respected citizens of Barbour
ville, but for a number of years
latterly claiming Kansas City.
Missouri for their home.
Mr. and Mrs. Lock were with
their daughter for several months
previous to her death and accom
pained the remains for inter
ment in the cemetery near the
old home at Barbourville.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Byrley were
graduates of Union College, Mr.
Byrley during the administration
of Dr. Stevenson and Mrs. Byr
ley during the administration of
President Faulkner. Mr. Byrley
was also a graduate of Washing
ton Law School and Mrs. Byrley
taught for a while in Union Col
lege. They were married in Barbour
ville, sixteen years ago.
Mrs. Byrley was known in her
girlhoood for her kindness, gen
tleness, inteligence and firmness
of character, these qualities even
more significantly marked her
womandood and distinguished
her as a wife and mother. Two
splendid boys, Jack and Paul,
aged 12 and 14 had her constant
care and nttention even during
:.u ilmess. It is given to but
few at the same time to bear pain
and great bodily suffering so
patiently and maintain so live an
interest in the affairs of the home
and of life in general. Up until
the very day of her death, Mrs.
Byrley was the same forceful
personality and so her death,
though expected, came withal,
moit m grtat a ibtck ai if t bad
1 been sudden.
The temporary interment was
( in the Faulkner vault on Sunday
, afternoon, short services being
conducted in the M. E. church.
After the arrival from Atlanta,
the remains rested in the home
of Dr. J. S. Lock, Mrs. Byrly's
oldest brother. Other members
of the family and coming from a
distance were Mr. and Mrs. G.
A. Lock of Kansas City, Mo.;
Mr. and Mrs. G. H. Wilson of
Philadelphia; Mrs. F. C. Rector
of Columbus, Ohio, a cousin.
This sad occasion and the re
turn of so many members of both
families renews in the memories
of the many friends in Barbour
ville, the days when the home-
of the Locks and Bvrlevs were
among the most prominent and
hospitable in the community,
both families being leaders in
every movement for the better
ment of the community, church,
school and business life, though
regretting deeply the occasion of
their return, the entire commu
nity is always glad to welcome
the surviving members of the
families.
Yawning
German scientists claim that
yawing is extremely beneficial,
as it stretches the muscles of the
brain, sends the blood to the
jaws, and sharpens appetite and
intellect. The remedy is so
that it is being used extensively
in this town, to Judge by some
of the hardworking chaps who
hanjj around the corner stores
exercising tneir jaws and
stretching their muscles. Yawn
ing may be all right as a brain
exerciser, but we believe a few
hard licks toward actual work
would produce more lasting ben
fits for this town. We have
enough jaw exercise to keep us
on the front page for eternity.
What we need is a little classified
effort along practical lines Lit
tle things embodying real work
will produce more results than
ail the yawning in the world.
The officers of the German army
may sharpen their intellects by
yawning exercises, but it is a no
ticeable fact that they arn't idlo
with their hands in the mean
