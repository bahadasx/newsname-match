F. M ADAMS A
WITH
Run Down by Frightened Team
Monday Morning and Succumbed
to Injuries Monday
Evening?He was a Man of
Sterling Character, a Useful
and Faithful Citizen and His
Death is Greatly Deplored.
F. M. Adams, a prominent and successful
merchant and planter of
Adamsburg, this county, was run
down by a runaway team Monday
morninp about 8:30 o'clock and died
irom tne injuries about iz nours later.
The accident occurred just in front of
"his home, and in a most uftusual way.
It seems that Mr. Adams had been
out to his store nearby, and was returning
to his dwelling. Pausing on
the side of the driveway to give directions
to a farm laborer, the team, a
horse and mule hitched to a two-horse
wagon, suddenly made a dash, the
driver being unable to stop them. The
runaway team swerved out of the
road to one side, ran over Mr. Adams,
coming upon him from behind. The
team then turned back into the road
and ran about 200 yards before the
driver could bring them to a halt.
The injured man had his leg broken
between the ankle and knee, and
was injured internally, either from
one of the animals stepping on his
side or by the wheels passing over.
Just how the fatal injury was received
no one of the eye witnesses could say.
The internal injuries, it is thought,
were the ones proving fatal. Some
vital organ was ruptured or bruised,
and the result was fatal.
Mr. Adams was well-known
throughout the county, and wag held
in high esteem by his neighbors. He
was a progressive business man an<J
planter, and by hard work and close
application has gained success in his
enterprises. He wag 58 years of age,
and is survived by his wife, who was
before her marriage, Miss Julia
Vaughn, and six children: J.. B.
Adams, Mrs. Lewis Scales, L. F. Adams,
Ben F. Adams and Russell AdamB.
Mr. Adams was a member of the
Masonic fraternity, and has held
prominent positions in the order. He
was a faithful member of Philippi
church, and was active and generous
in all matters looking to the advancement
of the church. His life was devoted
to all worthy causes and every
just claim found in him a champion.
He has lived a consistent life before
his fellows, and the influence of that
life will never die. His community
will greatly miss his wise counsel, his
.? -merous benevolence and his honest
service to his fellow men.
TVio -/ *?
a?iv uapviow tau^r, uuiMllf U1 1*11'.
Adams' own church, came in for generous
support from him. .He was
rarely absent from the meetings of
the association, the State convention
and the annual meeting of the Southern
Baptist convention. He was a
man of few words, but his words were
well chosen. His judgment was spund
:id his heart was as honest as a
heart can be.
Mr. Adams was interested in everything
that tended to build up his community
and his State. He was a good
citizen, a faithful friend, husband,
father. His tragic death has caused
many hearts to be sad. He will be
greatly missed. But he leaves a
name more precious than silver and
gold and his worthy life will go 011 in
its influence to the end of time.
The burial was at Philippi' church
Wednesday afternoon at 2 o'clock. A
large company of sorrowing friends
and relatives gathered to pay a la?t
tribute to Ihis good man's memory.
God's will is accomplished. The seed
of a good man's earthly pilgrimniage
is but the beginning of a life wonderful
and eternal.

harden of Gethsemane, the sudden
ippearance of the hostile crowd, Jesus
forsaken by His disciples. His utter

THARD
ITERNAL SLEEP
The End Came About 1 O'clock
Tuesday Afternoon?He was
One of the Leading Physicians
of the Piedmont Section and
a Man of Exemplary Life?
His Death a Distinct Loss to
the County and State.
I)r. W. (). Southard passed peacefully
into the Great Beyond about 1
o'clock Tuesday afternoon, and after
a year's period of ill health. Although
he had been for a year in declining
health, he was able to be up to a very
recent time, to spend considerable
time in his drug store and did considerable
office practice. For the past
two or three months he had been eon
fined to his home practically all the
time. He was a great sufferer through
the weary months of his illness, but
he faced his suffering with fortitude
and without fear. He often expressed
a wish that his end might be free from
the distress and discomfort that so often
accompany the last stages of the
disease that had fastened upon him.
This prayer was granted to him, for i
when the end came, as he sat in his
chair, life slipped away before even
his faithful wife, her arm about his
neck, realized that it had come. Jonesville,
and, indeed, Union county, will
feel the loss of this worthy man, for
he made himself felt in all worthy
affairs of his community. He was interested
in the educational, moral and
social life of his community, as well
as in the material progress of the
town. He advocated and helped pro
mote improved schools, and used every
opportunity to educate his own children,
thus setting a worthy example
to other citizens.
He was for 40 years or more identified
with the Baptist church, and i
the life he lived was one that honored |
his church. His moral life was above 1
reproach. He believed that a man's
I life should be as pur oas the life of ,
a woman, and his life was true to this '
devotion to the single standard. In
his profession he stood at the top.
He was a man of marked ability and
for 40 years he journeyed day and
night, seven days in the week, upon
his life's mission of healing the sick.
He has a record for faithfulness in
service that any man might envy. Dr.
Southard was a prudent, a methodical,
an honest and determined man. To
these qualities he owed the success
that came to him in the accumulating
of some considerable amount of proplife
should be as pure as the life of
this man would accuse him of having
in his possession a dollar of dishones'v-obtained
money. His success was
not by unworthy methods, but upright.
dilligent effort, well-directed.
William Oscar Southard was born
in Brooklyn. N. V., Aug. lf>, 1851,
died March 7, 1916. He would have
been 65 years old on August 16, this
year. He came South when a lad of
17. to visit his sister, who was Mrs.
M. J. Bates, and from whom he had
been separated when a child of three
years.
Dr. Southard graduated from the
medical department of the University
of fleotgia in March, 1875. Immedi..ftm,,

for the practice of his profession,
and for a period of 11 consecutive
years he has continued to practice
there and for miles around. " lie
took post graduate courses in New
York Polytechnic, holding diplomas
from that institution, also.
On Sept. 10. 1874, he married
Caroline Bates, a sister of 1 >r. P.. t
Bates, of Spartanburg count v. Hi
widow and four children horn to th union
survive him. His children are:
Miss Carolina 0. Southard of CoItiml
in. Mrs. J. T. Scott. L. ('.. Southard
and Mrs. S. H. flreer of Jottesville.
He is survived hv two sisters:
Mrs. Josephine Pier of Jersey City.
N. J? and Mrs. F. N'. Lawrence of
Horners Town, N. J., and one brother,
Henry Southard of Newark. N. J

it. nuuuiaid was a memner oi I he
Masonic fraternity and of the Woodmen
of the World, and was promi'nerU
in both these orders.' He was a man
found faithful in all the relations of
life. In the church, the home, society,
in business, in the fraternal orders-^wherover
he moved, he eommandejl
the respect and esteem of his fellow*.
At the close of an active, useful life,
he f*lls asleep, crowned with the rewards
of a life spent in service. He
h?s nassed from the toils and responsibilities
of earth into the rest that
remains to the children of God.
