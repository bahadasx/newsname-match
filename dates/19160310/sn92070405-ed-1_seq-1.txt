PROPOSED STRIKE
MEANS TIE UP
A nation-wido movement for
higher wages has been instituted
by the four large organizations of
of railway employes. The railways
called upon for this advance in-
lude all those in this country and
some in Lanada, operating alto
gether 280,000 miles of line. Three
hundred thousand men are involv
ed in the movement, and the in
crease amounts to about 25 per
cent in present wages and about
87 1-2 per cent in overtime pay over
that fixed by arbitration and would
add -one hundred million dollars a
year to railway operating expenses.
It is a matter of common know
ledge that the railroads are pass-
ag through one of the hardest fi
nancial periods in their history,"
says Vice Presidént Scott, of the
P. Company. "Something like
forty-two thousand miles of line, or
approximately one-f ith of the mile
age of all the railroads in the coun
try, are even now being operated
under receivership. Officers of
the brotherhoods have been quot
ed as saying that unless the pres
ent demands are granted, a strike
rather than arbitration will be re
sorted to. What effect this would
have on the commerce of the coun
try it is not difficult to imagine.
The United States is now entering
upon what has been predicted to
be an unprecedented condition of
propsperity, partly due to the up-
torn conditions in kurope. Para
lysis of the railroads would be par
alysis of the country's commerce at
most critical stage.
MINES AND MINING
85 MINE SECOND
LARGEST PRODUCER
That the 85 mine of this district
s the second largest copper pro-
ucing mine in the state of New
Mexico, was shown in the gross re
turns as given by the State Tax

Hawkins law, whereby the net val
ue of the output of each producing
mine is taxed as other property.
The 85 Mining Company is ass
essed with $762,921.78 as their re
turns and $183,689.00 as demined
by the Commission. The Grant
county levy amounts to 6 mills and
the state levy to 3.95 mills, a total
of 9.95.

New Mexico metal and coal mines
combined in 1915 was approximate
ly $22,000,000. The metal output
alone was $15,000,000.

TOWN IS JUDGED
BY NEWSPAPER
"Show me some copies of the pa
per published in your town and I
will tell you some facts about it
and your people."
The man who said that was an
active business man, who was con
sidering an expensive proposition,
and the information he wanted was
all in the columns of a weekly
npwsnaner.
He wanted to Know aooui me

merchants, to judge their business
capacity by the style and amount
of advertising they employed the
paper would show him. :
He wanted to know something of
the social activities of the town,
which the paper would show hiptt.
He wanted to know something of
the pursuits of the people of the
town and the condition of the sur
rounding country. The paper would
show him. '
He would scan those papers very
carefully, and then he would be
able to give the information as he
had stated. .
One hundred years ago the first sar-
lags bauk In the United States was es
ttbllshed. The advent of this institu
tion came with the era of commercial
nd industrial expansion. It came
when tho population of the United
States -was only 0,500,000, and there
were but 240 banks In the country. By
1820 ten of these savings banks hnd
been established with 8.C33 depositors
and aggregate deposits of $1,1.18,570.
Prosperity came, the people saved
and the deposits In these great reser
rolrs of capital, which now number
2,100, by leaps and bounds increased to
enormous proportions. To-day, wltn
our national wealth approximating
$187,000,000,000 and almost one bun
dred millions of people In the country
we have a"jout $4,700,000,000 In the
savings banks belonging to ten and a
half million depositors. This may
seem an amazing sum of capital and
number of depositors, but when a com
parlson Is made with other countries
and a balance is struck It Is found the
United States Is dear the end of the
list lu the perceutoge of suvers to pop
ulutlon.
The possibilities for the greater pro
motion of habits of thrift and saving
among people are Indeed extraor
dinary. With remarkable opportuul
ties in the United States for Increas
ing foreign trade; with bumper crops
la every section of the country; wkli
eold nourlniz Into the colters of the
barks; with every appearance of un
precedo ted future prosperity, the fact
is ant to be disregarded that tlie otnei
errant rnmnilTI'lttl nations Of the WOl'lll
are involved In a war of frightful de
struction and economic waste; that art
er tho wnr these nations will need
funds for reconstruction and the Unl
ed States will bo called upon to sup
ply them; that for some time t come
this country will not be able to secure
capital, as In the pust. from ! rnm-e
and Great Brltulu, (or the purpose of
carrying on new enterprises. The
United States must finance Itseir.
No fear need be hud for the liunie
dlate future, but It Is Inevitable that
the time Is coming when this country
must meet tho test of financing prac
tically the entire world. Preparations
are being made for defense in the
event of war; preparations should also
be made for peace. Adequate credit
machinery cau be developed and per
fected, but it will assuredly require a
sufficient amooiit of capital to main
tain properly and keep in good running
condition this credit machinery.
How Is this capital going to De se
cured? Through education; by calling
the attention of the people to the lack
of thrift in the country, and the beuer
flclal results of practicing thrift; I
through a systematic nation wide cam
paign to promote thrift and saving. It
urely la to the interest of all citizens,
whether banker or business man. edi

employe, to be a party to such a move

A REAL ARTIST
There is a talented musician in
work for the past many years has
been the real foundation of this
the Schubert Company, whose
noted organization's success. Qui
etly, unassumingly, artistically,
she has served her art earnestly
from a great love of it. Other as
pirants for fame, with but a small
portion of her great ability, have
made desperate efforts to advertise
themselves into renown by the cir
cus methods so obnoxious to all
true artists, the while that Lavinia
Zendt has been serving the divine
muse modestly, loyally and royally.
While she is an accomplished in
strumentalist, it is the rare depth
and rich quality of her phenom
enal contralto voice that has en
deared her to a multitude of Amer
ican and Canadian music lovers
ANIMAS ITEMS

Since the crass began to show.
cattle have' left the more nourish
ing winter growth for the tender
shoots, and as a result are not as
fat as they were a month ago.
However, under normal con
ditions, all except the old decre
pit cows will come through in
good shape.
Owing to the heavy snowstorm
of last winter and the consequent
soaking of the ground, farmers
report conditions excellent for a
good crop this season, as the re
cent warm spell has caused many
of the fruit trees to bloom, fears
are felt that the late frosts may
ruin the fruit crop. In the event
there being no heavy freezes
there will doubtless be a bumper
crop of fruit.
