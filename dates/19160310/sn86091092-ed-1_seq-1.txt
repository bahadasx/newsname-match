PALMER SUCCEEDS AS
PRESIDENTWESTERN
NATIONAL BANK
At a meeting of the board of di
rectors Saturday F. J. Palmer was
elected president of the Western Na
tional Bank of this city, to till the va
cancy caused by the death of former
Governor Jahn T. Morrison.
L. S. Dille, for some years cashier,
was elected vice president, and F. R.
Miller, for the past five years cashier
of the Bank of Jordan Valley, cashier.
Charles Davis and H. D. Blatdiley
retire from the board, being succeeded
by the above named gentlemen'.
F. J. Palmer is perhaps best known
to the general public of Caldwell as
one of the biggest and most success
ful sheepmen of this section. At the
annual wool sales held here, the Pal
mer clip receives prominent mention
not only because of its size, but be
cause it generally sells at around the
top price.
For 20 years Mr. Palmer has been
doing business in Caldwell and has
fed large bands of sheep near here
during the past winter.
Mr. Palmer has been successful in
his undertakings, as may be gathered
from the fact that he is president of
the Quinn River Bank of McDermott,
Nevada; is president of the Bank of
Jordan Valley; and is now president
of the Western National Bank of
Caldwell.
Caldwell Has Splendid Future.
"I am no stranger to Caldwell," said
Mr. Palmer yesterday when seen by a
representative of The Tribune. "Twen
ty years ago I received financial back
ing here when I first started business
in this part of the country.
"I am thoroughly conversant with
conditions obtaining in Caldwell and
surrounding territory and was influ
enced in accepting the presidency of
the Western National Bank by a firm
belief in the great possibilities of
Caldwell, situated as it is in the cen
ter of one of the most promising sec
tions of the entire west.
"My interests are closely identified
with the country round about and I
feel that in entering the financial cir
cles of Caldwell I can be of use to
the community and perhaps share in
the great prosperity that I feel sure
will come in the near future.
"The policy of the Western Nation
al will be to take care of the interests
of its patrons in the best manner pos
sible: consistent, of course, with the
principles of modern banking—and to
assist in all legitimate efforts in the
upbuilding of Caldwell and surround
ing country."
F. R. Miller, the new cashier of the
bank, comes from a like nosition with
the Bank of Jordan Valley. He is a
stockholder in the Bank of Jordan
Valley as well as in the Industrial
Savings Bank of Flint, Mich., his home
town.
Mr. Miller has been cashier of the
Jordan Valley bank for the past five
years and thoroughly understands
western conditions. He has been in
the real estate and banking business
for years and will be an important ad
dition to the business forces of Cald
well.
Mr. Miller's family comsists of a
wife and two small children. Mrs.
Miller is at present visiting aat Flint,
Mich., but will soon join her husband
here. The family will take up their
residence here at once.
Mr. Palmer took occasion to speak
of the years of service that L. S. Dille
had given the Western National and
the fidelity and care with which he had
served its interests.
In assuming the position of vice
president Mr. Dille «'ill remain as ac
tive in the affairs of the batik as ever
and becomes one of the principal ex
ecutive officers of the organization.
Four directors. Messrs. Dille, Mar
tin Jensen, William Graff, and Ed
Hedden, who have been connected
with the Western National Bank for
years, remain. These gentlemen arc
well known irr the city, having made
Caldwell their headquarters in one
capacity or another for many years
They arc familiar with the affairs of
the bank and of the general commu
nity. They have ably assisted in
building up the banking business of
the Western National and will contin
ue to do so. The nvwly elected board
of directors is probbalv the strongest,
from a strictly banking standpoint,
that this bank has ever had. Every
member of the board has had wide
banking experience.
The acquisition of men of the char
acter and standing of Mr. Palmer and
Mr. Miller will not only add to the
Strength of the Western National but
will prove of inestimable benefit to
the whole community,

COMPANY "G" INSPECTION
NEXT WEDNESDAY EVENING
Federal inspection of Company "G"
will occur next Wednesday evening.
The federal government bill to "fed
eralize" the National Guard will un
doubtedly pass Congress in the very
near future and the standing of each
company will be placed by its showing
at the inspections t.tking place now.
The local company has elicited much
favorable comment from army oflicors
who have watched them drill and it is
hoped that the full strength will be on
hand Wednesday.
Mrs. L. M. Beal of Kutia visited her
daughter, Miss Marjorie, of the Col
lege, returning home Tuesday.
SHANK AUTO COMPANY
WILL MAKE IMPROVEMENTS
Carload Lots of High Priced Cars
Now Arriving in the City.
The garage of the Shank Auto Co.
will undergo a number of changes,
improvements and enlargements with
in the next few weeks. The building
will be enlarged by the addition of a
room 40x50 feet at the rear. This
room will be of brick and cement and
will be used for the machine shop.
The front of the building will be used
for show room, storage for cars and
offices. New machinery and equip
ment are arriving daily. Mr. Harry
Wilson states that when fully equip
ped the garage and machine shop will
be among the best in the northwest.
The company will be able to do any
thing in the line of repair »Work that
can be done out of the factory.
The improvements are now under
way. The dust prooif show room will
be in front and to the right as you
enter. The store room •will be in front
and to the left. The offices of the
manager will be between the store
rooms and the machine shop.
Cole Machines are Arriving.
The Shank Auto. Co. is handling
the Cole car, one of the best machines
made. The company ships in carload
lots and distributes from this point.
Three cars, the 7-passenger, big six
and the roadster, price $1595, factory,
are carried in stock by the company.
The Shank Auto Co. is on an equality
in every respect with the big agencies
of Salt Lake, Spokane or Portland.
This company is also agent for the
Buick, a popular car in these parts.
However, particular attention is call
ed to the Cole which will stand up in
comparison in beauty and finish,
workmanship, lasting qualities, and
all around usefulness with any car
made. Mr. Harry Wilson states that
he has driven a big six 45,000 miles
without a cent's cost for repair and
today the car is as good as when it
left the factory. Mr. Wilson says:
"The poor man cannot afford to
buy a cheap car. His investment in
a car should prove a resource and not
a liability to him. The Cole will
prove a resource at any time that it
is in his possession. Its first cost is
higher than some other cars but when
the car is bought the owner has
car and wot an expense bill."
Mr. Wilson feels confident that the
Cole is a suitable car for this country
and these roads, and confidently ex
pects that the sales this year will be
fully as great as can be looked for.
BADLEY GIVES FAMOUS
RILEY ENTERTAINMENT
(Special to The Tribune)
Corvallis, Ore., Mar. 6.—O. V. Bad
ley, formerly of Caldwell, now of
Portland, gave one of his famous Ri
ley entertainments before an appre
ciative audience at the First M E,
church last Saturday evening.
The wet disagreeable weather con
ditions prevented many from attend
ing. In spite of this, however, the
main auditorium was almost a third
full.
Mr. Badley proved to be all that his
advertisements claim—impersonator
worry chaser, grouch exterminator,
frown killer, and all. His interpreta
tiom of poems, both serious and comic,
from Riley and other poets, could
hardly be improved upon. The jokes
which he handed out between selec
tions kept his audience in a gale of
laughter.
During his stay in the city Mr,
Badley was the guest of his old
friends and townsmen. F. M. Rosema
and family.
Shrove Tuesday Celebration.
Shrovetide, the two or three day
before the beginning of Lent, is a time
for preparation for the observance of
the 1 enten fast. Shrove Tuesday, for
merly, was passed in sports and
merrymaking, an important feature of
which was a supper of pnnc.ikes. Miss
Louise Riddle was flic latest victim
of the "surprise" habit which lias de
veliiped among those who gather
around Mrs. Stauber's table. She ha
a birthday this week. 1 n order to sur
prise her it was necessary to antic'
pate the actual date a little.
Shrove Tuesday was chosen for the
■taking and a supper of waffle
accompanied by genuine maple syrup
and a few other harmless viands took
the place of the usual festive dinner,
Later the guests indulged in games
and all too soon the hour for dispersal
came. The guest of honor, having re
eeived the felicitations of her friends
felt that the occasion was "as fit f
a pancake on Shrove Tuesday"
Shakespearre puts it in All's Well
That Ends Well.
Ash Wednesday.
Wednesday of this week is the first
day of the six weeks of the lenten
season kept by three-fourths of Chris
tendom' as a season for strengthening
the Christian character by great
acts of devotion, practicing self de
niai, paying more attention to alms
giving and prayer. Forty days, ex
clusive of Sundays, are set apart for
this purpose in commemoration of the
40 days spent by our Lord in fasting,
prayer and temptation. It is not
superstitious rite as some suppose
but is coming to be more asid more
understood and respected each year
in this country by those who have
never known its meaning. The first
day is called Ash Wednesday becau
in former times the priest used
sprinkle the people with ashes to re'
mind them that the body is, after all,
only dust and will after death return
to dust.

Wednesday.

General L. V. Patch of Payette last

a satisfactory manner 'he duties of
this office to which I aspire."
General Patch is a Canyon county

has been engaged m business for the
past 14 years. He has a wide ac
quaintance throughout the state by
reason of the public posi'ions that he
has held. He is recognized as one of

important industrial enterprises.
General Patch is an Iowan by birth.
He was born at Mt. Pleasant, Iowa,
in 1876. He became a resident of
Nebraska in 1900 and lived in Omaha.
He was graduated from the State Uni
versity of that state in 1898, and was

CALL GOVERNOR TO ACCOUNT
FOR MISREPRESENTATIONS
The Republican members of the
state land board showed their dis
pleasure of the antics of the gover
nor's personal organ, when at a meet
ing of the land board last week the
governor was taken to task for his
statement in the Capital News which
sought to make it appear that the
governor was the only member of
the land board who favored foreclos
ure upon past due land loams. In
the early part of January the board
passed a resluotion authorizing the
attorney general to foreclose upon all
loans in arrears previous to January
1st, 1914. The governor with other
members of the board, although vot
ing for the resolution, urged that in
some cases the state would no doubt
be better off if an opportunity was
given for land values in Ada and ad
joining counties to revive, these loans
having been made for the state by
previous land boards at a time when
land values in these counties were at
high tide.
When the News made the governor
appear as being in favor of these fore,
closures on land loans, he was con
fronted by Miss McCoy as to his at
titude on the land board. The gov
ernor stated that he was not interested
in what the News said and had noth
ing to do with what appeared in that
paper.
This led to inquiries from the board
as to where the News secured its in
formation in relation to board meet
ings' and board doings. Secretary of
State Barker maintained that there
was no reporter for the News ever
present at land board meetings, and
Register Hale said that only upon one
or two occasions had the News in
quired from him as to what was done
in board meetings. This "passed the
buck" up to the governor and when
the opportunity was given him to have
his private secretary, Mr. Broxon. and
the reporter of the paper appear be
fore the board, he did not want his
private secretary summoned, and
when the reporter was invited to ap
poar before the land board he refused
to make his appearance. Republican
members of the board proved to their
satisfaction that the governor was
closely related to whatever informa
tion went out from the land board to
be printed in his newspaper and made
it pretty apparent to the governor,
thht that being the case, he would
have to expect to be held accountable
for what his paper said about the
land board.
WESTERN PACIFIC REORGAN
IZATION MAY GO THROUGH
Favorable Report Current in Wall
Street to This Effect.
It was reported on Wall Street
Wednesday that the reorganization
of the Western Pacific railroad would
be put through. This reorganization
which was fully discussed by Co.
Place in the columns of The Tribune
during his recent visit to this city,
provides for the construction of the
Winnemucca-Caldwell and Wells
Twin-Falls branches.
The reorganization plan was worked
out by Mr. Benj. Bush when he was
president of the Western Pacific. The
plain fell through because the Goulds
refused to go into the scheme with
their Denver & Rio Grande railroad.
Ordered to Asylum.
Examination of William Lawlis,
here from Nampa Tuesday evening,
resulted in his being committed to the
Bliackfoot asylum for the insane. It
seems that Lawlis has gone rather
violently insane over brooding about
his troubles an<! political subjects.
Drs. J. M. Henry and T. D. Farrer
sat on the examining board with Pro
bate Judge Frank Meek.
NATIONAL DIRECTOR
OF CLUBS COMING
Mr. G. E. Farrell, Aassistant Na
tional Director of Boys' and Girls'
club work will be in Idaho the latter
part of next week, and Canyon coun
ty is to have the honor of entertain
ing him for one full day—probably
March 16th.
Mr. Farrell will tell our boys and
girls and their parents of the wonder
ful work being done in boys' and girls'
clubs all over the United States, and
his coming will be an inspiration to
every one interested in rural life and
rural education.
Our slogan in Canyon county is
Rural—not city—education for the
boys and girls in rural schools. Ida
ho has no large cities. The state is
just one big rural community, hence
practically every school is in a sense
a rural school and should teach its
boys and girls to solve the problems
they will meet in rural life.
Mr. Farrell can tell us in an in
tensely interesting and practical way
how these problems are being met
and solved in other communities. He
edvocates the "New Education"—the
education that teaches the hands as
well as the minds—that teaches the
boy to be a producer, not a consumer
of wealth.
Every parent as well as every boy
and girl in Canyon county should hear
Mr. Farrell. Canyon county stands
first in Idaho in Boys' and Girls' club
work. Let us hear how we rank with
the counties of the United States
One meeting will be held in Payette
at 10 a. m., one in Caldwell in the
evening, and one in Grenleaf in the
afternoon. Eight high schools will
turn out for the Greenleaf meeting,
six for the Payette meeting, and fif
teen for the Caldwell meeting.
After Mr. Farrell's address at Cald
well, Professor O. D. Center, of the
extension Department of the Univer
sity of Idaho, will present to Canyon
County, the beautiful first prize ban
ner won in 1915, in the State Club
Contest. It will be a "Banner Day"
—Everybody come.
ROYAL GWENT WELSH
SINGERS ARE COMING
The fame of Welsh choral singing
became world wide, \yhen in 1872
mixed choir consisting mainly
Welsh village folk, under the leader
ship of Caradog (Griffith Rhys Jones)
won the Cyrstal Palace Company'!
$5,500 challence trophy and a cash
prize of $500. This fame was enhanced
in the following year, when .he same
choir under the same leader again
won the trophy, beating the London
choir, known then as the Paris Prize
Choir, under the leadership of M
Proudman. The sons of *he princi
pality have ever since maintained the
fame and ever enhanced the standard
established and set by the Cyrstal
Palace victories.
Of all the Welsh musical organiza
tions, the Royal Gwent Welsh Singers
has been the first and foremost, not
only to maintain the fame, but to set
a standard to Welsh or any other
choral singing that has never yet been
excelled.
The visits of the Royal Gwent
Welsh Singers is by no means a new
venture. Indeed, it is now a matter
of history. Americans were first thril
led by these singers from the land of
song as early as 1893, when two
Welsh choruses front Wales won first
prizes at the World's Fair, Chicago.
The Royal Gwent Singers stands—
and sings—before the world today as
the unsurpassed organization of its
kind, and, incidentally, as the standard
bearer through all lands of the super
iority of the Welsh nation as a nation
of singers. It would be a difficult
task to analyze this fact, but it can be
realized more easily by attending their
concert in the M. E. church on April
1st.
A daughter was born to Mr. and
Mrs. William Skelton Tuesday.
HOLT SUGGESTS BLACK
CANYON PEOPLE FORM
ULATE PLAN
B. M. Holt has just returned from
an extensive trip east, visiting Canada,
New York and Washington on busi
ness matters and taking a Florida
coast fishing trip.
While in Washington Mr. Holt call
ed upon Senator Borah and Congress
man Addison T. Smith. Both of these
gentlemen appeared astonished when
informed that the settlers of the Black
Canyon district had not fully agreed
to abandon the proposition of obtain
ing government help to water the dis
trict upon the reclamation service
reclaiming a section of 25,000 acres.
Some one had evidently made
strong representations to these gen
tlemen that such was the case and
they were proceeding upon such pre
sumption. It is claimed that Engi
neer Weymouth, now at Denver, in
his report to the Department, either
made a recommendation or assertion
that the settlers were willing to fore
go any right they might have, if the
government would undertake the rec
lamation of a tract of 25,000 acres
hat earn be easily watered.
The Tribune was unable to get into
touch with Mr. Weymouth in time for
this issue, but will endeavor to get
some statement from him for next
week.
Settlers Should Organize.
Both Senator Borah and Congress
man Smith suggested to Mr. Holt
that the thing for the settlers to do
was to get some definite proposition
as to exactly what they wanted—no
generalities, but a poin't-blank propo
sition that is feasible and has the
backing of facts—and that under such
conditions lay the only hope of any
favorable action in the near future.
Sentiment is already crystallizing
mong the settlers that now is the
time to organize and see that proper
representations are prepared covering
a definite proposition to put up to the
Reclamation Service and to Congress.
The South Side settlers would un
doubtedly act in harmony with the
Black Canyon settlers, as by this
means they would be enabled to re
duce the cost of the Arrowrock dam,
which will be assessed to them. Thus
far only some 160,000 acres can be
found upon which to assess the cost
of the dam and anything which will
help to distribute the cost over a
wider field will probably be welcomed.
The Reclamation Service report,
we are informed, enough surplus wa
ter in the dam to cover the irrigation
of about 25,000 acres. If they admit
this, the surplus will probably cover
a larger area, as the Service officials
are rather conservative now. If the
Black Canyon district would agree to
buy this water, they could begin op
erations at once and in a few years
build power plants and pump water
from the Payette as a supplementary
supply to cover the whole district.
It is an established fact that new
land uses more water than after it has
been irrigated for several years. By
the time the first lamd watered had
been brought under proper irrigation
there would be a surplus of water to
start new land; and by that time the
district could have a pumping propo
sition started.
Several settlers h'ave announced
their determination to try and arouse
interest among their fellows to start
something. They will probably hold
meetings amd get some definite plan
outlined in the near future.
John R. Jones, a well known jour
nalist of southeast Idaho, has become
