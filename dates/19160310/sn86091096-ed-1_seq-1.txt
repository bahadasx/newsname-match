High School
Entertainment
Lyceum Course Program A
Pleasing Feature
The Lyceum Course entertainment
: T "riday night given by the Kendrick
school was a success in every way.
The manner in which the school
children handled their various parts
Showed that they had received care
fill training and that much time had
been spent to make them proficient
in some of their difficult drills,
t The "Mother Goose" operetta by
f e little folks of the first ajnd
cond grades was very well carried
<|ut. No doubt this was the first
appearance on the stage for most
them but no severe case of stagë
fright was noticeable.
: The Indian Drill by the third and
fourth grades was a picturesque
number. The stage was trans
formed, by the use of evergreen
shrubs and trees, into a dense forest ;
with this as a background and the
boys and girls in their Indian cos
tumes, the picture was a pretty one
indeed.
, The fifth, sixth, seventh and
eight grades put on the operetta,
"A Mid Summer Eve," in a pleas
ing manner. The costumes and
coloring in the different scenes pro
duced a beautiful effect particularly
during some of the intricate drills.
The stage setting was a wood scene
and represented a gathering of the
fairies.
A colored troop of traveling
entertainers then took posession of
the stage and gave a very amusing
performance. The personnel of the
company was made up of the follow
ing: Prof. Best, Norris Walker,
Eugene Gibbs and Percy McKenzie
They sang suothern melodies and
put on some real minstrel stunts.
The last number, a farce "That
Rascal Pat," was given bv the high
school. The parts were all well
carried out but probably Donald
McCrea, who impersonated the Irish
Rascal Pat, deserves special men
tion. Lester Crocker and Henry
Meyer both handled their parts well
to
this

A
and Agnes Grice and Edith Compton
appeared perfectly at home on the
stage.
The evening program was good
throught and the crowd was an
appreciative one. It is estimated
that, counting those who took part
in the program, over three hundred
were present. Two hundred and
nineteen reserved seats were sold
and about sixty general admission.
The orchestra music was a pleas
ing feature of the evening's pro
gram.

M. E. Ladies' Aid Supper
The Ladies' Aid of the Methodist
church gave a very sumptuous
dinner at the N. B. Long residence
last Thursday evening, March 2. A
large crowd was in attendance and
the tables were crowded with hun
gry people until a late dinner hour.
The people seem to know where
to go when they want a good feed
for the Methodist ladies surely
know how to prepare, serve and
entertain the patrons of the church
and others.
A very enjoyable time was had
by all, eating Idaho Baked Beans
and brown bread, cake, salads,
chicken sandwiphes and coffee. It
is needless to say, with tfoe above
menu staring you in the face, that
a good time was had by every one
present.
be
Mr. and Mrs. James McCoy, and
children from Oregon, arrived jn
Kendrick Wednesday. They will
go from here to Southwick to make
their home.
Train of Sugar from Hawaii
The first train-load of what is said
to be the largest trans-continental
shipment a commodity ever made,
passed through Chicago the first of
this week.
It is sugar from Hawaii. The
entire consignment, most of which
goes to New York refineries, weighs
250,000 tons, is valued at $25,000.
000 and the freight charges will be
in the neighborhood of $3,000.000.
The entire consignment will re
quire 6,000 freight cars or 120 solid
trains.
Baby Week
A Feature
A National Observance For
Better Babies
Throughout the county today
communities are beginning a baby
week campaign, in accordance with
plans formulated by the national
government, by holding special^ ser
vices in the churches with appro
priate sermons by the pastors on
baby welfare.
In every part of the country
scores of events of all kinds will be
held during the week, with the one
idea that appeals to all : that men
and women shall be awakened to
the needs and the greater care of
the baby. It is safe to say that
hundreds of thousands of women
will take part in various means that
will be adopted throughout this
notable week to do something that
will draw attention to a subject that
lies so close to every woman's heart
and interest.
We are conserving our forests,
our mines, our water power. What
are we doing to conserve human
life, our greatest national assest?
National Baby Week commenced
Sunday, March 5, and will continue
through Saturday. Why wouldn't
it be a good idea for the Kendrick
merchants to make special displays
of articles needed for the proper
care of babies. We have heard of
of nothing being done here to ob
serve this day, while all, or nearly
all of the surrounding towns, are
doing something to show their
appreciation of this worthy move
ment.

The Maurer Sisters Orchestra will
be the next and last number on the
lecture course for this winter. The
management is expecting something
unusually good from their evening's
entertainment and those who miss
this nuihber of the Lyceum Course
will be unfortunate indeed.
Some of the features of the pro
gram are cornet solos, flute solos,
violin solos, whistling solos, cello
solo, humorous readings, etc.
This series of Lecture Course

attempted and a good crowd

Information on The Light Plant
* - *
Electric Light Engines Will be Shipped From Chicago
March 16—Arrive in Kendrick March 25.
Definite information concerning
the delivery Of the generating
machinery for the local plant of
the Potlatch Electric Company has
finally been received. According
to the latest information received
by the manager of the concern, the
delay for the past three months has
been caused by a strike in the
machine shops of the General Elec
tric Company which made it im
possible for them to make deliveries
on machinery of any description
for several months. This, together
with the fact that the supply of
steel products has been curtailed by
the war condition in the east, has
made it a hard matter to get an
early delivery of the machinery
necessary for the operation of the
electric light plant.
In response to an urgent tele
gram addressed to the manufac
turers of the two engines and sent
on the 28th of February, they ans
wered that they had not made de
livery of the equipment because the
General Electric Company had not
yet delivered the alternators to
their factory at Chicago. The en
gines were already set up and had
been tested but, until the electric
machinery arrived, the whole out
fit could not be assembled for ship
ment. The engine company stated
in the same telegram that they
would ship the entire equipment
from Chicago within two weeks
from the date that the electric
machinery was received at their
Chicago, factory.
The manager of the light com
pany then took the matter up with
the Portland office of the General
Electric Company and asked for an
explanation of the delay in the
shipment of the alternators. With
in twenty-four hours, they phoned
in twenty-four hours, they phoned
the information that the machinery
had been shipped from Fort Wayne,
Indiana to the Chicago works of the
engine manufacturers on the 28th
of February.
According to this information,
the alternators will reach Chicago
on the second day of March and the
whole equipment be re-shipped
from that place on the sixteenth of
the month. The local office of the
Northern Pacific Railroad estimates
that it will require about eight days
foi the car to reach Kendrick ; and,
if shipped on the 16th, will reach
here on the 24th or 25th of March. !
The switchboards are already in
stalled in the plant, and, within
ten days from the delivery of the
car to the Kendrick yards, it will
be possible to have the plant in o
peration. It may be possible to in
stall the machinery in a little
better time than ten days but that
is a conservative estimate.

rules and regulations adoptqd by

George E. Crum
For Governor
Candidacy Announced For
Republican Nomination
George E. Crum, member of the
firm of White Bros. & Crum, has
issued his formal announcement of
candidacy for the nomination for
governor on the republican ticket,
Mr. Crum's announcement to the
press of the state is brief, state
ment being made that his policies
will be defined during the progress
of the primary campaign. The fol
lowing is the formal announcement
made:
"I have definitely decided to be
come a candidate for the Republi
nomination for Governor of
is
can nomination for Governor of
Idaho. This decision accords with
my own ambition to serve the
people of the State and the ex
pressed desire of many of its best
citizens for me to become a can
didate.
In the various ways open to me
I have made a reasonably thorough
test of the advisibility of such
tion on my part. Personal contact
with Republicau workers from vari
ous parts of the state, letters from
practically every county and a
friendly attitude of the state press
have induced me to believe that
the call to service is clear, in
sistent and sincere. Under these
circumstances, it seems to me it is
my duty as a citizen and as a Re
publican to enter the contest for the
nomination.
During the progress of the pri
mary campaign, I shall define the
policies which I believe should ob
tain in state government.
I am impressed with the duties
this announcement involves. No
man of character and of high re
gard for citizenship can view it
lightly. I am in the race with the
best there is in me for Idaho and
for the Republican Party, and am
in it to stay and to win.

played at the high school gymnasium
tonight, between the upper and
lower ends of town. The dividing
line to be the middle of the street
at the post-office corner.
This promises to be a very spec
tacular game and it will be played
to a finish. To avoid serious conse
quences which might result through
any misunderstanding of the 1916
rule book, there will be a double
set of referees and an extra umpire.
There will also be a score-keeper for
each side equipped with high
power adding machines.
In order to give each one of the
many players who are clamoring
for a chance to play, an opportunity
to get into the game, the sugges
tion was made that the halves be
lengthened to about fifty minutes,
thus allowing each player five
minutes to star in the game.
Arnica and witch-hazel may be
had in any quantity after the game
for those who are seriously Injured,
the proceeds of the game to be ap
propriated for that purpose.
The line-up of the opposing teams
will be composed of the following
