?f^PARIS, March 30.?There was 110
'change in the situation before Verdun
Silther east or west ot the Meuse. ac
'eording to a semi-official announce
inent made here this afternoon. The a"
nouncement adds that the violent bom
bardment continues on both sides ot
"the' Meuse. but there has been no
nfantry attacks by the Germans,
gjphe situation at Verdun is regarded
as touch bettor from the French view
"oint as the result of yesterday's light
jingS The public is'.grcatly cheered by
reports of successful resistence on the
part of the defenders of .the fortress.
Notwithstanding an enormous expendl
ffietof ammunition and unstinted sac

he inference is drawn by the gen
jfipublic is that the German wave
ma {advanced as fair as is in its power
?without .further -wastage on a large

Snot ,attempt to pursue their action
"ter. ;The great successes in battle
jiAj the present have been gained by
Rent shocks delivered by fresh and
sclally prepared masses ot Infant
gJuid have generally been achieved
jpldly. Ot such character was the
man attack on Verdun, which
jhed itself against the French de
res on February 26. The Germans
n'began a series of battles on small
ijvhts, sometimes at one point and
?ontetlmes at another. One day the
'^ick -was made on the extreme left
adSBethincourt to Goose Hill, on an
?mhcr.^day a blow was struck at the
[extreme' right at Fresnes and again
Douaumont. All these were genuine
'ticks carried out by masses of
M>ps capable of undertaking serious
tion. French military observers are
?Jlftiloss to explain the objects of
i?e .assaults, as it is believed that
ire'Is little probability they will
,ve grave consequences for the de
nders. The important question is
hefher things will go on this way
"ts.as in the case of the French of
lye in Artois, which beginning on
of last year, continued with
tlnlshlng force far into June, or

' Gifted men have painted great
pictures for tlie avowed purpose
of teaching the horror of war. But
even the best o? these wonderful

That Is It Is When Jolly Tom
Ford is Doing the
Honors.
Five roustabout boys appeared at
tlie city lockup last night and itBked
for lodging l'or (lie night. The young
sters were from Uniontown and were
on their way to have a good time, but
did not know where they were going.
They were given a night's lodging
and about 10' o'clock this morning
began to get uneasy as they wanted
to get out of Jail. They asked some
one to call Tom Ford, the traffic cop
at Jefferson and Main streets, and
Tom answered tlio call.
Arriving at the Jail, Tom asked the
boys what they wanted to eat. Their
eyelids opened like swinging doors and
their eyes almost popped out or their
heads. Each began yelling his cbolco
of a blll-of-fare and soon there was
such a turmoil that the policeman had
to fix his own blll-of-fare and send It
to the youngsters. They ate greedily,
one little redheaded.* freckled face son
of a coal miner finishing first. He
straightened up when his meal had
disappeared?and was about to leave
the festive table, which was a bench,
when the policeman asked him if ho
wanted pie. "Good God, man, yes! It
there any pie in this world?" Tom got
them some pie and after -each bad
finished, one of them remarked: "Gee,
they don't treat a guy dis good every
where." This wps likely his form ot
giving thanks.
The boys, after eating, were better
able to tell their respective taV03,
which varied to a great extent. But
the .only information gleaned from
them was that they were out for a
lark and were going home. Before the
officer -would let them out of Jail he
bought each one o[ them a postal card
and-'made them send a note to their
mothers, which each was glad to do.
?'After, accomplishing this terrible ef-;
iort, t the, boys were .given vthelr ? free
