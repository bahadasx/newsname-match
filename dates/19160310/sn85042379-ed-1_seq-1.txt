Registration Transfer.
County Clerk and Recorder W.. B.
Shoemaker has called the attention
of the Courier tö - the fact "that a
great many of the voters of the coun
ty are confused as to the present re
quirements of the registration laws
and has written the following letter
explaining in detail the different
points in the law that all electors
will have to be careful to observe:
To the Electors 6f Valley County,
Montana: >
Owing to the numerous changes in
the registration laws many electors
are confused as to its requirements,
as a number of electors who are al
ready registered and entitled to vote
at all elections held "Vithin the pre
cinct in which they reside, are ap
pearing at my office and asking to
register.
In order that electors may be
saved the trouble and inconvenience
of making a trip that is not required
of them, I submit the following infor
mation, which, by the way, is con
tained in mynotices published and
posted all over the county:
No elector who voted at the last
general election, held November,
1914, is required to register again, as
his or her name appears on our reg
istration books, and will be contained
in all lists and poll books furnished
to the judges of election at which
such elector is entitled to vote.
The only electors who must regis
ter in order to be entitled to vote
are those who failed to vote at the
last general election held in Novem
ber, 1914, or-who have not registered
since that time.
Any elector, who has changed his
residence as to ward or precinct since
registering, must make application to
have his registration changed to con
form to his present residence, other
wise his name will appear on the list
and poll books and show in original
registration, and he may be deprived
of his vote. Electors who reside
more than ten miles from the office
of the clerk and recorder may make
such application by appearing before
a justice of the peace or notary pub
lic, resident of his precinct, and sup
plying the information asked for in
the blanks supplied for effecting such
transfer. , . 1 ,
This may be the means of saving
some elector making an unnecessary
trip to this office; if so, it will have
served the purpose for which it is
published.

Clerk and Recorder.
TWO KILLED AT HAVRE.
Peter Burkett and John McKnight
were instantly killed and Daniel Sei
greson lost his left foot in a peculiar
railway accident in the Great North
ern yards at Havre last Sunday morn
ing. . .
Purkett and McKnight were brake
men on a train that had just come
in from the west with Al Foster as
conductor and Lee Dunham, engineer.
The train was blocked on the main
line temporarily on account of
switching and no room in the yards,
and Engineer Dunham was ordered
by the yard master to take his en
gine and run up to the east end of
the yards and connect with a fieight
train already made up, east bound,
and help by shoving the train out of
the yards.
Brakemen Purkett and McKnight
got on the pilot of his engine to give
signals and make connections with
the caboose on the outgoing train.
It is reported that the engine was
making an unusual amount of
steam, which obscured, to a certain
extent, the view of the engineer and
the fireman. The engine plowed into
the caboose of the east bound train,
throwing it off the track and pushed
it fully a car length ahead with the
train, to which it was attached, crush
ing in both ends of the caboose.
The bodies of- Purkett and Mc
Knight, who were riding the pilot of
the engine, were' bkdly crashed, and
their death was evidently instantané«
«us- . ■ . • > •■■■<■
Brakeman Seigreson was Just com
ing out ot front door of the ca
boose when the collision occurred.
Had he been a second sooner he
also would have been killed. He was
thrown backward into the caboose,
his left leg being caught and his foot
amputated.
McKnight had been employed by
the Great Northern about two years
and leaves a wife and child, who are
now visiting in the east.
, Purkett is a young man about 20
years old, and has been the main sup
port of a widowed mother and Bix "lit
tle brothers and sisters. He has been
cailboy for two years and, to earn
more money, his mother gave him a
minor's release, so he could go brak
ing.
BASEBALL REPORT
IS ENCOURAGING
1915 Team Report Shows No Back
Bills—1916 Team Assured.
In this issue of the Co'tfrîëi- - Will
be found the 191& report of the Glas
gow Baseball association. The re
port shows the team to be in good
shape financially, all of the back bills
for the past two seasons having been
cleaned up, thus allowing the 1916
management to start with a clean
slate. All of the business men of the
city are enthusiastic over the pros
pects for a team the coming season
and will back the management to the
limit. A committee is already at
work laying plans for the new team
and when the season opens up this
spring Glasgow will again have one \
of the fastest teams in the state. Lâst
season Glasgow broke better than
even with every team played, with
the exception of Chinook, and this
year the chief aim will be to wipe
out the exception.
The retiring management wishes
the Courier, at this time, to extend to
the -business men, ball players and
fans of the city its heartiest thanks'
for the whole-souled co-operation and
assistance rendered by them. It was
chiefly due to support and kind as
sistance that Glasgow was enabled to
put up the class of baseball that we
did during the 1915 season. We trust
that each and every individual will
take the same interest the coming
season and boost for the 1916 team.
A meeting will be held in the very
near future to elect a manager for
the coming year, announcement of
which will be made later.
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
When a man conies home at night
dog tired" and perhaps worried
about his business, questions, even
sympathetic questions, are like men-j
tal weariness. I, et silence like a j
poultice come to heal the wounds of
sound. Have sense enough to leave
him alone until his brain is rested
and his mood changes. Thus advises
Eleanor Clapp, writing for Farm
and Home.
EMPORIUM STYLE SHOW.
The Emporium Dry Goods company
are advertising their annual spring
style show in this issue of the Cour
ier. The shçw this year will be held
on Saturday afternoon, March 11, at
the Orpheum theatre in this city and
Mrs. Slattery has made arrangements
to make this show one of the events
of the season. All are cordially in
vited to attend. There will be no
charge for admission.

BUSYMEETING
Many Committees Report Fav

FREIGHT RATE DISCUSSED
Committee Appointed to Try and
Secure Jobbing Rates Into
this Point.
The board of directors of the Glas
gow Commercial club held an ad
journed meeting in the club rooms,
Tuesday evening, transacted a large
amount of business and considered a
number of new propositions.
One of the pleasant features of the
meeting was the report of the freight
house committee, consisting of F. D.
Alvord, 4. L. Truscott and J. W. We
dum, that the Great Northern Rail
way company will build the long de
sired freight depot at Glasgow. This
structure will be built during the
summer and is expected to be ready
for use by August first.
Another report from the fire de
partment committee, of which W. W.
Hurd is chairman, to the effect that
the city council had appointed Dug
Hall chief of the department, was
well received. Mr. Hall will have
complete charge of the re-organiza
tion of the fire department, the sign
ing of members of the department, as |
well as supervision of the apparatus.
{Consideration was given the - advis- j
ability of adding new apparatus to |
size in the state
the present equipment by purchasing
new chemicals. The directors ex-,
pressed favorable opinions to this and |
deemed it advisable to leave the se
lection of the kind and capacity to the
judgment of the city council and the
fire chief. Glasgow will, within a
shprt time, have the best fire depart
ment to be found in any city of its

The club will render substantial
aid to the county grade and high'
school athletic meet to be held in |
Glasgow in May. The committee to ;
work with Prof. Williams consists of
Maurice Reuler, J. P. Mclntyre and '
Walter Shanley. The committee held
a meeting and outlined plans for,
making the event a success. The j
city council granted the use of the.
ball park and city team for making
the athletic field. A running track
provided. This will j
will be built and other apparatus
provided. This will, no doubt, bring ^
several hundred people to the city at,
the time the meet is held.

A vi.it Glasgow, planned b y the
. . . . . ,«
state highways commission sometime
'
in April, at which time a good roads ;
meeting will be held, being brought i
to the attention of the directors, it
was decided to hold a meeting of
members on one of the evenings they,
are here. A committee, composed of,°P
W W Hurd F I) Alvord and Wal- !
iter Shanley was appointed to formu-|'°
lat e a plan of entertainment. It is
expected a luncheon will be provided
!to be open to everyone, at which talks
/■ • . „ t. j i
of interest will be made by the visit
iors as well as by local men.
Announcement that the Gamble-]
Robjngqn Company had established a
branch of theil . who i esale frui t com-,
mission business here brought out the
p OSS jbiliti e s of Glasgow developing
a ] a r^e jobbing center. There
, . g eve ,.y reason to believe that oth- J
erg re p resen tjng different lines of
i business will be located here before
y eai . j s completed.
i A site for the 200-barrel flour mill,
I — be , ocated in
nl _ ^
i Glasgow this spring, has been looked
into. Two very desirable locations
j have been se l ec ted so that there will j
^ ^ difficulty for the club to fur
nish just what is wanted when the
I f j na , p j ans are perfe c te d and the-mill
people ready to build. The mill will i
mean quite an increase in the popu-1
lation of the city as it will employ
a considerable force of employes, as j
well as meaning a very large increase
in the business of the city. |
One of the vital points of
est to the Commercial club at pre«^
ent needing attention is the neces
sity of providing proper rates for
shipping out of Glasgow. This is a
matter requiring considerable study
and detailed labor. It has been un
der consideration for many months
by the club, and Walter Shanley, Ot
to Christenson and T. J. Hocking
were appointed as a committee to
look after the interests of the city in
the matter.
The directors voted to mount in
a beautiful frame, a picture which
the Lewis-Wedum Company will
hang up as an honor banner, to be
awarded to the school room showing
die highest saving percentage. This
is to encourage school children to
save their money and will be used in
connection with a saving system re
cently introduced in the schools by
the local banks.

YOTTER BUYS OUT
HARDWARE FIRM
Takes Over Entire Interests in Rob
ertson-Yotler Store.
A deal was consummated the fore
part of the week whereby H. A. Yot
ter becomes sole owner of the Rob
ertson-^ Y otter Hardware store in this
city. Mr. Yotter has acted in the
capacity of general manager for the
firm ever since it opened for busi
ness in Glasgow eight
years ago.
D° r i n g that time they have built up
a vei 'y substantial business; in fact,
they have outgrown their present
quarters and Mr. Yotter is now con
templating the erection of a large
modern building on his lots on Sec
on( * avenue south, adjoining the new
R un dle building.
Mr. Yotter's many friends will be
pleased to learn of his taking over
the entire business and join with, the
Courier in wishing him success. •

VALLEY COUNTY
FAIR DATES SET
Directors Set September 7, 8
and "9 for 1916 Fair. ~
BIG ATTRACTIONS SECURED
"Rollo the Limit," and Famous Eu
ropean Trio Furnish Sensa- •
tional Dare Devil Acts.
Visitors at the Valley County fair,
to be held at Glasgow Thursday, Fri
day and Saturday of September 7,
8 and 9, will witness the best en
tertainment ever shown in Montana.
The directors have signed up two es
pecially attractive features, offering
one of the greatest sensational acts
every produced, and one comedy act
which has never been sold outside the
large eastern state fairs before.
The sensational act will be that of
"Rollo the Limit." This act features
a daring feat of skill, wherein Rollo
risks his life to furnish a few min
utes of real sensation. He dashes
down an incline 70 feet long at light
ning speed on roller skates, turns a
complete backward somersault in mid
air, looping the loop over a space 25
feet wide, landing on his feet on a
platform beyond. It is an actual
flirt with death and the act will be
given twice each day on the fair
grounds. It is recognized by all who
know the act as being the most sen
sational outdoor attraction ever wit
nessed.
The other is an act of oddities in
which Ramza and Arno with the
famous burlesque Bloudon as the
trained zebra furnish more laughs to
the second than was ever produced
on any platform. These three men
are coming to Glasgow direct from
the big eastern vaudeville circuit. It
is the first time for their appear
ance in the west, as they are an Eu
ropean trio who never showed in this
country until after the war began,
when they came over to the United
States, having been signed by the
Western Vaudeville Managers' asso
ciation of Chicago, by special ar
rangement. Their act is entirely ori
ginal, filled with clear comedy, such
as will appeal not only to children
but to all the grown people.
By holding the four fairs circuit,
as was arranged last year, composed
of Valley, Blaine
these attractions were secured for
! each fair at half their usual charge.
They represent a $1,000 attraction,

NEW OIL ENGINE ARRIVES.
The large engine for the power
plant arrived Monday and a crew of
workmen have been busy all week
moving and erecting the large piece
of machinery. The engine is an oil
burner of the four cylinder type and
is capable of developing about three
hundred horse power. This model is
noted for economy and will easily
generate the required amount of
power. The addition of this engine
is a great asset to our light plant and
gives Glasgow an equipment that will
be hard to beat.

CLEAVER RESIGNS
AS FISCAL AGENT
E.
C. Cleaver Leaves Glasgow
and Gas Company.
Oil
A meeting of the directors of tfce
Glasgow Oil and Gas company was
held at their offices on Saturday
evening, at which time some changes
were made in the personel of the or
ganization.
There has been more work in the
disposal of the development stock
than was anticipated, and Mr. E. C.
Cleaver found it necessary to sur
render his connection as fiscal agent
of the Glasgow Oil and Gas company
in order that he might devdte- more'
of his time to the Plentywood pros
pect. Too much depends upon the ac-.
tivities of the fiscal agent at both
Glasgow and Plentywood,- placing Mr.
Cleaver in the position of having to
spend a great deal o£ time traveling
back and forth between the two cities.
As the Plentywood company was his
opiginal prospectus he felt himself
obligated to continue the work of
floating that installation, and for
that reason tendered his resignation
as fiscal agent of the Glasgow com
pany. • •'
Mr. Cleaver arrived in Glasgow to
promote the local company early in
December. It was organized and re
ceived its charter on December 13,
1915. The board of directors, con
sisting of five local men, are Dr. A.
N. Smith, president; J. L. Truscott,
. .* J . .
vice president; Dr. Mark I). Hoyt and
E. D. Coleman, directors, and S. C.
Moore, secretary-treasurer have had
the handling of the company's affairs
from the first and have looked af
ter the interests of the investors
with studious care.
Up to the present time there has
been close to (iOOO shares of stock
subscribed for and within a short
time it is expected a contract will be
signed for drilling. Under the pres
ent plans, it is expected several very
promising sites for sinking wells will
be prospected. The geological re
port, already submitted, indicates

The company plans upon having

report be as promising as the first

prise if a flow is struck when actual
drilling is started.
All stock subscriptions will be
called at once and when these are
paid up, the company will select a

The company will put stock on the

sink the first well. Should it be a
| producer there will be no trouble se
j curing financial support tor more
holes. It is a gambling chance for
all who purchase stock, yet for the
|good of the city every citizen can af
' ford to assist in developing the
prospect. Should oil or gas exist
here in commercial quantities, it will
be a valuable investment not only
for the stockholders but for the en
tire county. If no flow is struck, the
satisfaction of knowing there is no
oil or gas will be worth all its costs.
This is not a wild cat' scheme, but
a prospect for the interests of Glas
gow. It is a business proposition fos
tered by local men who will protect
the interests of all who become inter r
