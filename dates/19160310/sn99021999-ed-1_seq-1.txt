COM'MM'S, X. M.t March 9.
Mrs. Maude Hawkwright. an Ameri
can woman, who said she was held
; captive by Villa for nine days and
was liberated in the midst of today's
fighting
declared late today that
Villa announced March 1 his inten
tion to attack Columbus and pro
ceeded north under forced marches
to carry out his purpose.
His men, with scant supplies of
water and meat, suffered severely,
she said, and many dropped from
their horses on the march to the
Boca Grande. Villa, she declared,
ruled them by fear and his officers
with the flats of their swords beat
thejsoldiers into animation suffi
cient to reach that point, where they
rested and prepared for the raid.
Tuesday, Mrs. Haw'-wrlght related,
Villa bandits attacked employes of the
Palomns Cattle comrnny engaged In
rounding up cattle, killing four Ameri

Mrs. WrlKit said her husband, Kdward
John Wright, formerly of Houston, Teat.,
and Frank Hnyden, a youth employed at
the Ia Booker sawmill, were taken from
the Wright ranch March 1 and, pre
sumably, killed. When she was taken
prisoner and forced to ride away with a
detachment of Villa's men, under Colonel
Nicholas Bervantes, she said a bandit
ordered her to giva her baby to a Mexi
can family.
Mrs. Wright was cared for today at
the home of Mrs. Slocum, wife of Colonel
II. S. Slocum, commanding the Thirteenth
cavalry.' There she toid the story of
her capture and experiences from the
tlmo she was taken from the ranch at
Colonial Hernandez, west of Pearson,
where the de facto Mexican government
was reported to hav maintained a heavy
garrison for the protection of Americana.
1'p to yesterday she said Villa wore civ
ilian clothing, a queer little round straw
hat and rode a small mule, but just be
fore the fight this morning he appeared
clad in the trim military uniform he used
to wear at Juarez and rode one of three
handsome sorrel chargers, which had not
been hidden during tho long march. Mrs.
Wright said Villa led nearly l.GoO men
upon the sleeping American town, at
which were quartered less than 300 Amer
ican troopers.

She said that some ot the men detailed
to guard her during the march north told
her that Villu had 3.000 men and 6,000
horses.
"It a!HHTa to me as if lie had twice
that many men and horse," she added.
Just before she and her husband were
taken prisoners with the Hayden boy,
Mrs. Wright said, the Villa men told her
they had raided Colonial Juarez, an
American Mormon Settlement west of
Pearson, looted all stores of .flour and
provisional and had killed some of the for
eigners. Rhe had learned nothing further
In corroboration of this story, she said.

me if I had any food to sell. My hmiband

Francisco Villa, outlawed Mexican
bandit, raided United States terri

tacked Columbus, killed at least
sixteen Americans and fired many
buildings before he was driven back
across the international border.
At least 250 troopers of the Thir

today stated that Villa had made a
stand five miles south of the border,
where spirited fighting ensued. In

The small detachment of troopers, un

against the renewed Villa attack and at
last reports were holding their ground.
The raid to American territory proved
costly to the bandit chieftain. The bodies
of eighteen Mexican bandits, including
Pablo I.o pel, second in command, had
been gathered and' burned before noon
and troopers reported an undetermined
number of dead still lying In th. brush.
Led to the attack under the slogan.
"Death to the Americans," Villa's fol
lowers fought with doaperat Ion. Just be
fore dawn they crept along ditches skirt
ing the Unltod States cavalry camp and
rushed the sleeping town, firing heavily.
The first volley brought American troop
ers into almost Instant action. While a
portion of the raiders engaged tha cav

chieftain began applying the torch and
shooting American civilians who ventured
from the buildings.

Immediately became targets for snipers

creeping close to American homes, en

ruse.
Stores were looted, oil was poured on
frame structures and the match applied
by still other bandits. The postofflee
was raided, fur :ture smashed, but the
lootera secured only one small registered
package.
Many civilians barricaded themselves In
their home and fired at the Mexicans as

The fighting in tho town ended al
most as suddenly as It began. Less than
two hours after the first shot was heard.
Villa's buglers sounded the retreat and
the invaders began a disorderly flight
