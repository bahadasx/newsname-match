Issued Statement.
Chief Ripple today issued a state
ment in which he asked the support
of the parents of Bemidji. He ex
plained the law and stated that it
would be enforced.
The statement of Chief Ripple is
as follows:
"It becomes my duty again to
warn parents, guardians and others
having the legal custody of children
under the age of 16 years, to inform
them that the ordinance in regard
to such minors, will be rigidly en
forced as it may mean the saving of
many a boy and girl from the evils
which always follow the neglect of
such duty.
Ordinance Cited.
"Now, in justice to parents and
also the police department, I will cite
Section 2 of said curfew ordinance
and ask the co-operation of parents
and guardians in helping enforce this
ordinance, as the starting of a boy
or girl on the right road will mean
success and happiness, while neglect
can only bring disaster.
"Sec. 2. of curfew ordinance, No.
IS provides:
"It is hereby made unlawful for
any parent, guardian or any other
person having the legal care and cus
tody of any such person under six
teen years of age to allow or permit
any such child, ward or any other
person under such age, while in such
legal custody, to go or be in or upon
any oi the streets, a'venues, alleys or
public places in said city within the
time prohibited in section one of this
ordinance, to-wit: Between October
1 to the Ian day of April, after 8
o'clock, and between May 1 and Sep
tember 30, unless there exists a rea
sonable necessity therefore. Any
person vio'atm^ the provisions of this
section rhall on conviction be fined
not exceed twenty-five dollars and
stand committed until such fine and
CT .ts are paid

BEMIDJI, MINNESOTA, FRIDAY EVENING, MARCH 10, 191ff.
E. M. SATHRE IS
ELECTEDSECRETARY
OFCOMMERCIALCLUB
Board of Directors Choose Present
Secretary of Merchants
Association.
COMMITTEE TO SECURE
SOCIAL MEMBERSHIPS
Rooms to Be Remodeled Lumber
Company Donates Magazine
Rack.
E. M. Sathre was elected secretary
of the Bemidji Commercial club at a
meeting of the board of directors held
Thursday evening at the Commercial
club rooms. Mr. Sathre was hired
for a period of two months at a sal
ary of $25 per month and a commis
sion of 20 per cent on all new busi
ness secured during that period.
Mr. Sathre is also secretary of the
Bemidji Merchants association.
Social Members.
The directors voted to create a so
cial membership to the club for the
payment of dues at one dollar a
month, the initiation fee to be re
bated to such memberships. The so
cial member will enjoy all privileges
of the club, but will not participate
in the equity of the club's property.
A committee consisting of G. W.
Harnwell, Attorney M. J. Brown, A.
M. Bagley and E. M. Sathre will can
vass the membership of the club and
other citizens with an effort to se
curing both active and social mem
berships. Inasmuch as the club in
structed the board to raise the dues
to $2 a month, it is believed that
the securing of social memberships
will be an easy matter. Many of the
business and professional men have
already agreed to take additional
memberships, provided the dues re
main at $1 per month.
Committee to Canvass.
Practically all members would be
willing to pay the two-dollar fee if
it meant the life of the club, and be
cause it is necessary to increase the
revenue, the majority have con
cluded that they would rather take
additional social memberships at $1
than to pay the $2 for a single mem
bership. The committee will com
mence work at once. A fifteen min
utes' canvass by one of the members
Thursday resulted in securing twen
ty-seven social memberships. The
aim of the committee is to secure a
membership of not less than three
hundred.
Rooms Improved.
Work of rearranging the club
'ooms and adding new features will
be taken up at once The tables will
be repaired, buffet modernized and
other entertainment provided. The
club will meet regularly every first
and third Tuesday evening of the
month.
A committee on committees con
sisting of H. E. Reynolds, J.
Brown, Charles Cominsky, George T.
Baker and W. Z. Robinson was ap
pcipfpd who will complete the work
during the next week and report at
a special meeting of the board.
A new magazine rack has been in
stalled, which is the gift of the St.
Hilaire Retail Lumber company, and
which can be used to splendid ad
vantage in the club rooms.

When You Need Sleep Call In A Friend
Tells of Hatching, Brooding, Feeding
and Exercise of
Chickens.
Must Be Comfortable.
In speaking of the points of advan
tage in building coops he cited the
fact that heat and comfort was neces
sary to make good egg records dur
ing winter months. "There are sev
eral things that are necessary to
make good egg records in winter,"
said Mr. Brown. "The chickens
must be comfortable, they must be
good laying breeds and must be
hatched in the early spring.
"If a chicken is hatched after Ap
ril it is an absolute impossibility for
it to lay. A chicken for good lay
ing purposes should be matured by
August, although such breeds as Min
orcas, Leghorns and such breeds do
not need as much help and nourish
ment, ranging, etc., as others.
Too Much Food.
"There is one point on which many
chicken raisers make a great mis
take A chicken can be given the
right amount of food and still be
given too much, or it can be given
the right amount of food and not be
given enough. This is determined
by the amount of work or scratching
must be done to get its feed. It is
always well to have hay, sand, straw
or excelsior on the floor of the coop
in which the chicken must scratch
to get its food.
Feed Milk.
"In feeding a goodly amount of
'kimmed milk is of great advantage,
still if this cannot be obtained a rab
bit, fish or some such meat is a good
substitution. However, it is not of
good principals to feed them musk
rat or skunk, as such flesh might fla
vor the eggs. Grain such as wheat
screenings, oats, barley, etc. ,are al
so very essential in the feeding. If
only one grain can be secured add
plants such as cabbage, carrots, beets,
boiled potatoes or the like for green
feed.

BELTRAMI COUNTY
ORGANIZATION MEETS
Before a large and enthusiastic au
dience, C. E. Brown, chicken expert
of the Crookston Experimental sta
tion, gave an address last evening at.
the Junior high school assembly hall
on "Hatching and Raising Young
Chickens." A full attendance of the
Beltrami County Poultry association
and of the agricultural classes of the
high school, in addition to numerous
other enthusiasts formed Mr. Brown's
audience.
Begins With Coop.
After an introduction by John
Harris, president of the poultry as
sociation, in which he stated that
Mr. Brown having judged at the last
two fairs and the December poultry
show, hardly needed an introduction
to his audience, Mr. Brown began his
address with the construction of a
chicken coop. He later spoke of the
hatching, brooding, feeding and ex
ercise of chickens.
Through hand sketched illustra
tions, he enumerated the various
points essential to the chicken's com
fort, in the construction of the chick
en coop. The use of straw thrown
loosely on the rafters to absorb the
moisture and aid in ventilation was
his most importance suggestion of
house construction.

BULLETIN
Washington, March 10.Am-
erican troops are being sent into
Mexico after Villa, President
Wilson officially announced this
afternoon. At a cabinet meet
ing it was decided* to authorize
the sending of a punitive force
of 8,000 men. The single ob
jective is to capture Villa. Un
confirmed reports this afternoon
state that Villa is dead and that
Carranza has been imprisoned.
However, all efforts to communi
cate with Carranza have failed.
"Hang Villa to a tree," was
the statement made by Repre
sentative Miller of Minnesota in
the house this afternoon.
John Lind, former United
States envoy to Mexico, in a
statement issued in Minneapolis
says that the Villa excursion
was financed and inspired by
interests on this side.
BULLETIN
St. Paul, Minn., March 10.
Governor Burnquist and Ad
jutant General Wood of the Min
nesota National guard are con
ferring this afternoon on plans
for calling out the state militia
if necessary.
Washington, March' 10."Crush.
Villa," is the American slogan that
must take the place of the former slo
gan, "Watchful waiting." A com
plete cleanup of bandits promises in
definite fighting for the American
border army, it was stated here to
day. Intervention or invasion of
Mexico is not considered but merely
the promise to campaign against ban
ditry.
Senator McCfumber today intro
duced a resolution directing the
president to send sufficient troops to
Mexico to quell the bandit activities.
Pressure is being brought upon
President Wilson to adopt a "Villa
dead or alive" policy.
It was pointed out that the United
States could concentrate 6,000 Am
erican troops with special equipment
at Columbus, N. M., in 24 hours.
These troops are at present stationed
along the border.
Guns Fail to Work.
Reports that the American ma
chine guns failed to work at a criti
cal time aroused intense interest here
today. An investigation is certain.
Officials claim that the guns were in
good condition.
General Funston on the Mexican
border in a message here urgently
recommended that American troops
be given authority to pursue the Mex
ican bandits into Mexico. A pnitive
force will be allowed to follow the
bandits.
Raids Continue.
Columbus, N. M., March 10.Bor-
der raids on American ranchers and
farmers continued this morning. The
Villaistas again crossed the United
States border in several places be
tween Columbus and Hachita loot
ing ranch houses and driving off the
livestock. Buildings were destroy
ed. No Americans were murdered
and officials claimed that the invaders
were cleared off American soil be
fore noon. It is thought that there
are 4,000 bandits within easy reach
of the American border.
"The Americans will suffer for Mr.
Wilson's act in recognizing bewhis
kered Carranza," Villa is reported
to have stated after his defeat yes
terday.
Sixteen Americans were killed in
the raid yesterday. They were eight
civilians and eight soldiers. Other
American civilians and soldiers were
injured. It is estimated that Villa's
losses were about 150 killed and 200
wounded.
''Mrs. A. Elmquist left today for
the Twin Cities where she will spend
a week visiting with friends before
returning to her home at Nymore.
