TU.KS OX COMPESTIO LANs
South Backward in This Regard,
Pierre Porter Says.
Missouri has no workmen's compen
sation act. If an cmploe Is injured
he must resort to a damage suit and
the compensation is fixed by the jury.
This same condition exists in all of
the states of the solid South
These were facts brought out by
Pierre Porter of Kansas Cit, in an
address to the students of the School
of Law this morning Workmen's
compensation acts, ho said, are based
on tho idea that when a man goes to
work for another lie contributes his
skill and labor The emplo.ve's con
tribution, with the empIocr's capital,
gets out a product There is a risk
not from the carelessness of tho em-
ploe or an one else, but one that is
incidental to the work. It is a trade
risk and should be borne by the em
ployer, just as is the wear on the ma
chinery. A man should be compen
sated, the speaker said, not a a char
ity or as a punishment to his emploer,
but because of his loss of earning
power.

SHARETHESPOTLIGHT
Hotel Buzzes With Talk of
Moore's Sale and of
State Candidates.
J. A. HOUCI1IN HERE
Dr. Johnston Keeps His Se
cret, That Ashland May
"Scoop" the World.
With an avowed landidate for the
Democratic nomination for governor,
one who is about to avow himself (at
'2 p m tomorrow ) either as a candi
date for the same high office or for
United States senator, and a nearb
sale of blooded horses drawing huge
crowds, the Athens Hotel was a hum
ming place today and a good booster
for tho embryonic Daniel Boone
Tavern.
"I am not a politician today," said
James A. Houchin of Jefferson City,
the avowed one. "I'm a horse man.
I'm going to the E. D Moore sale and
I ma and I may not go homo with
some more blue ribboners
"We're alread entered, ou know,
for the Commencement Horse Show
here. That is the principal concern
just now of ni daughter, who is in
school in SL Louis She expects to
drive some of our horses at that
show."
About the particular plank which he
epectedto help him to the governor's
chair, Mr. Houchin laughed and said
that ho wanted to ride in over good
state roads
What Bad Roads no.
"Two weeks ago, one of my super
intendents bought some hay over in
Audrain County. I'm still without
that hay because it hasn't been pos
sible to haul it over some of our Mis
souri roads to tho station.
".My good road scheme runs like
this: Missouri has an annual auto
mobile tax of $350,000. This has in
creased 400 per cent in the last ear
Now my idea is to use this tax to pay
the interest and the sinking fund on a
slO.000,000 bond issue with which we
could build three highwavs across
Missouri. And this would include not
the gentle, rolling counties of this sec
tion of the state alone, but all of those
Ozarkian counties, some of which are
not even to be traversed on horse
back.
"I'm strong for a land bank, hut not
as planned in Mr Gardner's bill. That
is not comprehensive enough and lim
its the state's help to the man who
alread has a start in life and not the
.voting man tring to get on his feet."
To the Horse Sale In an Vuto.
"Come on, Houchin," said an anxious
companion, "the bosses will be picked
over." And with a backward wave
and a threat that ho would be over in
June to get a blue ribbon or two, the
politician went out and climbed into
a big 191C super-six which was to
carry him out to the horse sale.
Dr. J. T.'m. Johnston, he who is to
avow, was true to his resolve to let
his bOhood friends have the benefit
of that dramatic occurrence.
I will make no definite answer,"
ho said, "until 2 o'clock tomorrow
when I will talk at Ashland. Nobody
except my wife, my son and my pri
ate secretary knows what my plans
arc, and their lips are sealed.
I feel that it is due to my old life
long friends at Ashland that I make
the announcement of my plans there
to the people of Cedar Township. Un
til that time I have nothing to say."
John T. WuTland Here.
John T. Waland, an attorney of
Kansas City and assistant sergeant-at-arms
in the United States Senate,
was in Columbia today. Mr. Wayland
is candidate for tho Democratic nomi
nation for state auditor.

STEPHENS SENIORS
LOSE "PRIVILEGE 6"
Rights of Students to Have
"Chaperonless Dates" Is
Taken Awav.
DUE TO STROLLING
Punishment Will Last Proh
ahh Onlv the Rest of
This Week.
Letters and telephone calls ester
ilaj and today from Stephens College
senior girls to men in tho University
brought the news that "Privilege (,"
has been temporal ii suspended
This privilege gives seniors the right
to have "chaperonless dates" on Mon
day and Saturda nights. Then the
may go with oung men to any places
of amusement in town except picture
shows, for there they are likely to en
counter measles germs, officials of the
college say.
Yesterday afternoon the college
office had heard nothing of the case,
but this afternoon the clouds of m)s
tery began to scatter, for the office
gave out the information that "cer
tain" privileges no mention of which
ones, however had been taken away
from "certain" seniors, but would
probably be suspended only until the
end of this week.
Monday night, the letters say, a
couple left the college, intending to
go to a confectionery store and return
home immediate! afterward This
was shortly after 7 o'clock. By S:13
they had not returned. At 9:43 the
strollers sauntered up the campus
walk, only to encounter well, that is
how the rumor started.
".Mr. Woods was awftill peeved at
us," a miss wrote her University ad
mirer. "I don't know how long it will
be until we can again make dates."
After this week, it is probable that
he. seniors involved in the case may
once more go out with their Univer
sity gallants without having to be
passed b the Stephens board of cen
sorship."
