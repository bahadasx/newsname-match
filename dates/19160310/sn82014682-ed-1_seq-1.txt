an armed force into Mexico to "hunt down and destroy? the murdering
bands guilty of the atrocities against Americans.. ... ,

yWASHINGTON, D. C.,farclf i0.-No orders have yet been is
sued in the navy department in connection with the Mexican situation,
but it is considered probable that a part of the Atlantic fleet will be
placed. Mexican waters. The occupation of; Vera Cruz is pointed to
as a precedent of what may occur jn naval action to support land forces.
Furthermore, the fleet may be needed to patrol the waters adjacent
to coast towns if Americans are endangered by anti-American demon
strations on the part of the Mexicans. : . .
' It is learned that the administration is reluctant to make a tiaval
demonstration because of the possibility that it will be construed as a:i
action against Carranza. ' .. : : ' ...
r According to a message today from Juarez, Carranza makes no ob
jection to the entry of American troops to attack Villa. As a matter of
fact, messages have been received stating that Carranza cavalry has left
Guzmaa with the object of attacking the rear of the Villa forces,; an
witn the expectation that the American soldiers, supposed by Carrar.zi
