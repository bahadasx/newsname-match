ARRANGEMENTS MADE Bv TEXAS
PROMOTER TO GIVE THE LOCAL
FANS GOOD ENTERTAINMENT
THREE BOUTS ARRANGED.
Devotees of the boxing gnne are
going to be given an opportunity of
witnessing some high-class ;yloe con
tests in this city on (lie ni?h' tf
March 10. Al Edwards of Dallas,
who has been promoting the boxing
game for a number of years in the
southwest, has nmdr all' arrangements
to give the fans a real treat here on
the night of March 1(5, when three
classy bouts will be staged.
The first is a fifteen-round session
between Krankie Sanders of New Jer
sey and Jimmy Bibb of Fort Worth.
Both boys box at 125 pounds.
The next is for ten rounds, between
Stanley Dean of Fort "Worth and
Marty Gannon of Dallas who go In
at 100 and 13S pounds, respectively.
The third is a six-round flash be
tween a couple of 1 Ifl-pnunders, "Tex"
Ilinton of Dallas and "Itlff" Simmons
of the same burg. The bouts will be
staged at the Hohison opera house,
and it is expected that a large number
of out-of-town fan.! from neait- cities
will be attracted to the show.
The evening's entertainment will be
preceded by a battle royal between
five local negroes who have ring as
pirations. THE WASHINGTON AND SCIVALLY
RANCHES IN THE MOUNTAINS
ARE SWEPT BY FIRE WHICH
WIPES OUT PASTURAGE.
T. 11. Saunders of Fort Worth, who
is heavily interested in the cattle
business, was in the city today from
the Washington and Scivally ranches:
in the Arbuckle mountains, and stated
that an old-time prairie fire swept
both places the first of the week, and
thousands of acres of pasture were'
wiped out. Mr. Saunders says it
will work a hardship upon the cattle
men of that vicinity until grass comes.
R. F. Scivally was not so badly
hurt, as he had a great deal of feed
in silos which will kep his cattle
going until grass comes.
Mr. Saunders is interested in sou'h
west Texas and states that on ac
count of the drought the weeds, which
were depended, upon to furnish the
cattle with feed In short seasors are
not In evidence, and for that reason
considerable loss may be looked for
there. Rain is badly needed in this
section of the state for small brains.

NUMBER 133.
Washington. D. C, March 10.
President Wilson today or
dered American troops over the
Mexican border to capture or
kill the Villa bandits who yes
terday raided Columbus, N. M.
A statement issued at the
White House said :
"An adequate forcu will be
sent at once in pursuit of Villa
with the single object o captur
ing him and putting a stop to
his forays. This can and will
be done in entirely friendly aid
of the constituted authorities of
Mexico."
Senator MeCumbcr, repub
lican, introduced a resolution
in the senate today providing
for the president to immediate
ly send an armed force into
Mexico to "hunt and destroy
the murdering bands guilty of
atrocities against American cit
izens." Senator FjalLof New Mexico
introduced his resolution pro
viding for the recruiting of five
hundred thousand volunteers to
police Mexico.
The president's order In its present
stage does not mean Intervention. It
provides for a punitive expedition to
deal with the lawless forces over
which Carranza has no control, The
American government wants VUla
dead or alive. No steps will be neg
lected to carry out this object. A
force of not less than five thousand
men will be used, all of them from
Funston's commands. This action
was decided upon at a cabinet meet
ing held this morning, at which it
was said that Villa must he elimi
nated, as wac Hurrtu.
Mexican Ambassador ArredomH
would not comment on the news. Ho
said yesterday, however, that in his
opinion Carranza would' not resent
such action. No plans have been
made, so far as known, for the use of
national guards.
It was considered probable that the
Atlantic fleet might be placed in Mex
ican waters to protect Americans in
the coast towns. Officials at Wash
ington generally commend the presi
dent for his action.
It was said that the pursuit of
Villa will be undertaken In a com
prehensive way and organized plans
will be laid for his apprehension.
Officials received the news with un
disguised satisfaction. A general feel
ing of relief thut the administration
had decided to take this step was ap
parent. The announcement that the
president would send troops Into
Mexico after Villa was accompanied
by scenes not equalled by those at
the White House since the fleet was
sent to Vera Cnii.
Pains were taken by officials here
to point out that General Carranza
would reafixe the spirit in which,
American troops are being sent after
Villa.
The state department this morning
made it plain that the Incident is not
closed as far as the government Is
concerned and that negotiations with,
Carranza for permission to send the
troops into Mexico to clear out the
bandits will go forward. General
Funston said: "So long as the bor
der is a shelter for the band, they
will continue to harass our ranches."
In dispatches from General Funston
last night, h urgently recommended
that he be authorised to send AmerU
can troops over the border to clean
out the bandit gangs.
The board of county commissioners
have adjourned, harms finished the
work for the month, yesterday after
noon.
