'The Heart of the Rockies"
The Liberal Band is preparing a
local talent play under the direction
of Lenn Harris, that promises to sur
pass anything ever before presented
in Liberal in a home talent.
"The Heart of the Rockies" is a
very pretty Western comedy-drama
by Lulu Oerolde, one of America's
most prominent play-wrights. The
cast, with the exception of Mr. and
Mrs. Lenn Harris, will be composed
of Liberal's most popular young peo
ple. The play, which bears the title of
a western play, Is not of the rough
wild west type, but a clean pretty
western story full of good whole
some comedy with plenty of snappy
dramatic situations which goes to
make up a first class evening's enter
tainment. Lenn Harris, who Is directing the
piece, played the same bill the past
season In the larger cities of the mid
file west; previous to that was lead
ing man with the city show of "The
Rosary," "Polly of the Circus," and
many others.
Ruth Harris, who will also play An
important role, Is considered a very
clever comedienne and has been with
some of the best of companies. So
from all present appearances "The
Heart of the Rockies" will be the
best local talent In the history of
Liberal's theatricals. The date set
for the play is Tuesday, March 14.
Do You Vote?
One often hears a man who Is firm
In his belief that nation or state or
town Is being crushed by mlsgovern-
ment, remark In a tone of conviction,
"Well, I didn't vote at the last elec
tion and I don't expect to this year.
What does my little vote amount to,
anyway? I can't help matters any."
This man calls himself a citizen
although he refuses to offset the
vote of a grafter. He and others
like him are making it easier for po
litical machines to operate. He is
worse than the man who in ignor
ance casts a vote which Is not o his
.nterat,,jor there in bone that" the
latter will learn and votp Intelli
gently. When a man refuses, tQ do his part,
however small it may be,' In the gov
ernment, he has no "come-back" on
the way It is run.

LET A TAILOR TELL YOU HOW
MUCH THIS SUIT SHOULlTcOST
People marvel how It can be done for $17 00. If you were to take the suit without the
labels to an expert judge you would get a startling answer at to the actual worth of

Duck Epidemic Story a Ffcke
A. H. Moffet, deputy game warden,
recently wrote State Game- Warden
Tegemeler, asking for his version of
the story that all the way tram 100.
000 to two million ducks had died In
the Cheyenne bottoms In Barton
county. A dispatch has. been going
the rounds of the papers of the state
for a week or two telling of some
strange "epidemic" which was kill
ing ducks by the thousands. Some
versions said It was an epidemic, oth
ers that the ducks were starving and
freezing to death. All accounts
agreed, however, that the Cheyenne
bottoms was literally covered with
the carcasses of dead and dying
ducks. Several Lamed sportsmen
heard that the ducks could be eaught
while alive, and were planning1 trips
to the bottoms, but Mr. Moffet's let
ter from the state game warden
showed the story to be largely fake.
Very few ducks have died, and there
Is no epidemic. A few ducks, crip
pled In the ordinary way with gun
shot wounds have drifted Into tho
Cheyenne bottoms and some Of them
have died, but not a great number
have died, and the dead ducks had
previously been crippled by gunshot
wounds, says Mr. Tegmeier. Lamed

interested in the proposition can meet
him there and talk the matter over.,
There are several Spanish-American
war veterans In and around Liberal
wlio have promised to see after the
drilling of the company If it is au
thorized by the state, and Mr. Cope
thinks there Is enough material
around here to make' a cracking good
company. The organization of such
a company would be quite an adver
tisement for Liberal and It ought to
be helped along.

Becoming a Corn Country
One of the Liberal grain buyers
(name withheld by request) report
ed to us this week that from Satur
day, February 26, to Saturday,
March I, Inclusive, he had bought
7,265 b shels of common Indian
corn, all of which had been raised
during the past Beaaon In the terri
tory surrounding Liberal. The
Southwest has never been held up to
the world as a corn country and
makes no pretense at this time of
posing as such, but the good old
state of Iowa had better look to her
laurels or she will have to begin Im
porting seed corn from down here
some of these days.
