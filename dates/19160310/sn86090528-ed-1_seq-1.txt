Ed K Stephens, formerly a resident
of the Minco neighborhood, died at the
state hospital for the insane at Nor
man. March 3. Judge R. E. Davenport
the county court received official no
tice of Stephens' death this morning.
Stephens, it will be remembered by
those who read the gruesome story of
his confession of the murder of a
cousin, as published in thefDaily Ex
press at the time, was committed to
thy asylum on the ISth day o ias'.
September, as incurably insane. De-
fore that he had been committed to the
asylum and afterwards discharged as
cured.
Following His discharge, and again
showing tendencies of what was fear
ed to be homicidal mania, Stephens
was restrained of his liberty by Grady
county officials pending a secaud in
quiry into his mental condition.
It was while confined in the Grady
county jail that Stephens confessed to
Sheriff Bailey that a number of -year
before he had enticed a feeble-minded
cousin, also named Stephens, to a
lonely spot on hitt farm northwest of
Minco, during the still hours between
midnight and dawn, and there murder
ed him and burled the body, afterward
cultivating the eartn and raising crops
of cotton and corn from the soil which
hid beneath its surface the gruesome
result of his crime.
Investigation upon the part of Sher
iff Bailey and his deputies, whom
Stephens accompanied to the scene of
the crime, (brought to light indhsput
able evidence of the truth of the weird
tale told by the demented man. Dig
ging down at the spot indicated by
Stephens as the place where the grave
had been dug and the victim buried,
the skeleton of the murdered man was
brought to light. Thu bones were
junibW together In a manner wntcn
showed that the murderer had stamped
and Jammed the mangled body of his
victim into a grave which had been

with a gaping hole crushed In on one
silo, rested when unearthed, upon
the pelvis and the bones of the arms
and those of the ledgs were crumbling
to dust, mingled together.
At the time of Stephens recommit
ment to the insane asylum, following
the unearthing of the crumbling skele
ton of his murdered cousin, the physi
cians testifying before the insnnity
iward stated that his dementia was o'
a homicidal kind and that he wou'.d
