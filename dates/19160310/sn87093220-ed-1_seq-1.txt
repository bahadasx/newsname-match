CANNED SALMON
KING ALL OVER
COUNTRYTODAY
Brisk Trade In Delicacy Should Mark
Observance of National Canned
Salmon Day.
Today is National Canned Salmon
day. In Aberdeen, as in all other
cities of the Pacific Northwest, there
is special reason for the day's ob
servance. Householders should and
doubtless will buy a can or two today
and serve the succulent fish in some
way on their tables, if they have not
tasted salmon in the past month. The
Washington customs district exported
$5,867,722 worth of salmon last year.
Packers of the Pacific coast in 1915
put up 7,506,046 cans of salmon.
Another Militia
Company to Be
Organized Here
Lieut. Springer App'ies to Adjutant
General for Permission to
Enroll Guardsmen
Aberdeen may furnish another
company for the 2nd Regiment, N. G.
W„ if the application made by Lieut.
E. V. Springer of Company G of that
regiment is regarded favjorably by
Adj.-Gen. Maurice O. Thompson. This,
with the Fourth Division, Naval Mili
tia, will make three militia organiza
tions on Grays Harbor. In the opin
ion of Capt. H. A. Comeau, of Com
pany G, there should be no difficulty
In recruiting another militia company
here since there is every probability
that the new national guard pay bill,
providing that guardsmen shell draw
25 per cent of regular army pay, will
be passed.
FEW CAMPS SHUT DOWN
Snowfalls this week caused a few
logging camps to suspend work tem
porarily, the Lytle camps at Porter
being visited by a fall of 1% feet.
The first of the week saw Grays
Harbor's visitation by a heavy south
west wind with heavy rainfall. No
damage beyond the blowing down of
a few billboards, was done, how
ever.
BERRIES DUE SOON
Local stores will be handling straw
berries from California in a week or
two, according to word from the south
land. Prices just at present are pro
hibitive, but they should be down con
siderably In a few days.
CHAMBER WILL
GIVE PRIZE FOR
BEST COW TEST
Five Dollars a Month Pledged By
Trade at Home Committee of
Local Organization
The trade at home and farm com
mittees of the Aberdeen Chamber of
Commerce, at a meeting Wednesday
perfected plans for helping the better
dairy stock movement in Grays Har
l bor county. The trade at home com
j mittee pledged itself to pay $5 a
month in prizes for the cow testing
association: $2.50 for the pure bred
cow that makes the best test for the
month; $2.50 for the grade cow that
makes the best test. Plans also were
taken up for the splending of the
$200 to be given by the Chamber for
community prizes at this year's coun
ty fair at Elma. It is hoped to di
vide the county into districts and to
make a section of the Chamber busy
itself with each of these to get the
contest between communities well
started.
The carpenters and others at work
in the store room in the Finch build
ing, which, when completed, will be
occupied by Thomas, the Jeweler and
Diamond Merchant, are doing good
work.
This new and up-to-date store, when
completed, bids fair to be the finest
establishment in the city and one of
the best in the state.
Be loyal to your home town; buy
everything you possibly can in Aber
deen; every dollar you send away you
are impoverishing this town just that
much.

CASE AGAINST

Prosecuting Attorney Stewart de
clares unfounded the rumors that the
case against Charles Johnson, arrest
ed some weeks ago on a charge of
conducting a gambling house here,
would be dropped. Johnson's $750 bail
money was returned to him, explains
Stewart, simply because he has prop
erty here and could not afford to
flee the law.

A REAL BHOE SALE
Garman ft Ziegler will commence on
Saturday morning a Sale o( Shoes
of the utmost importance.
The dull business has left them with
altogether too much stock and if
prices will do the trick "Jeff" says he
sure will reduce it.
Everyone knows that Shoes, along
with other goods, have soared away
up in price, but the Garman & Ziegler
stock was bought before the prices
advanced and along with this, during
this Great Sale, the prices will be
Cut Twenty-five to Fifty Per Cent
and in the case of odd lots and broken
lines —why, a dollar and a quarter will
buy about five dollars worth of Shoes.
This is a fine opportunity for the
whole family to stock up on Shoes.
Another chance as good as this will
not occur for many a year.

ELEVATOR IS SURPRISE
McKinley Johnson of Ocosta
saw an elevator the other day
for the first time. He was with
a cannery boss who was taking
him to his Alaska cannery.
They were in Seattle en route
to the job when the boss en
tered a hotel elevator. John
son thought it a place to de
posit luggage and, dropping his
grip within and stepping out,
was startled to see the cage
shoot upwards. Thinking the •
trip to Alaska was to be aerial
he loudly implored the boss to
wait for him. Later, Johnson
learned all about elevators.

DANGERS OF DRAFT
Drafts feel best when we are hot
and perspiring, just when they are
most dangerous and the result is
Neuralgia, Stiff Neck, Sore Muscles
or sometimes an attack of Rheuma
tism. In such cases apply Sloan's
Liniment. It stimulates circulation
to the sore and painful part. The
blood flows freely and in a short time
the stiffness and pain leaves. Those
suffering from Neuralgia or Neuralgic
Headache will find one or two ap
plications of Sloan's Liniment will
give grateful relief. The agonizing
pain gives way to a tingling sensa
tion of comfort and warmth and quiet
rest and sleep is possible. Good for
Neuritis too. Price 25c, at your
Druggist. 1.

GRIFFIN PLANS
NEW HOTEL IN
WYOMING TOWN
Former Aberdeen Boniface Likes
Place Where $15,000 It Paid for
Right to Bore Streets
North central Wyoming looks good
to A. H. Griffin who, since selling his
interest in the Hotel Washington last
year, has been traveling around a bit
looking for a business location. Mr.
Griffin has been in Aberdeen the past
few days settling up some business
matters here. Next week he will re
turn to Greybull, Wyoming, which is
enjoying a very healthy oil boom and
where Mr. Griffin plans to open a new
hotel. With a population of only 1,000
receipts at the town's railway passen
ger station have grown from $400 last
August to $6,000 last month. Several
oil companies are at work and the
town council, for $15,000, has granted
the privilege of boring for oil in all
the streets and alleys.

That Dealers Must Obey Pro
visions of 1913 Law
Under decision of the United States
supreme court handed down this week
merchants of this state must quit giv
ing trading stamps and other similar
trade catching devices unless they
pay $6,000 annul license fee. The law
would have gone into effect in June,

been carried to the higher courts. It
provides that concerns handling trad
ing stamps must pay the $6,000 license
in every county In the state.

I Washington Now to
See Best Times in
Years, Says Wolff
Local Merchant Returns From Cali
fornia With Optimistic and
Cheery Message
Washington, the hardest hit of all
the states in the late financial depres
sion, is feeling the returning wave
of prosperity latest of all, but when
that wave reaches its crest here the
| state will enjoy a measure of good
! times unknown for many years. Such,
j says George J. Wolff, is the opinion
of shrewd business men whom he met
on his recent trip to California.
"A difficulty confronting merchants
now," says Mr. Wolff, "is to obtain
goods in sufficient quantities. There
is no combine responsible for this
condition. It actually is the fact that,
due to the war in Europe, it is becom
! ing increasingly difficult to obtain
i woolen and other goods and the dyes
I necessary in the business."
While in San Francisco Mr. Wolff
| attended the convention of the fourth
district of the B'nai B'rith, and was
honored by being placed on the or
der's national social service commit
tee, olj which Dr. Rudolph I. Coffee of
Chicago is chairman. He also was
made director of the immigration com
mittee, western branch of the B'nai
B'rith. The work of this latter body
is especially to look after the condi
tion of immigrants; to see that they
are started on the right path and
given a chance to mix with the right
associates upon their arrival in this
.country; and, conversely, to see that
j those immigrants who do not show a
I disposition to be law abiding citizens
are curbed by the laws of the country
of their adoption.

I work undertaken by the council. The
i matter was referred to the street

i Mayor Phillips was instructed to
take up with the county commission
j ers the question of aid from
1 the county for the Wishkah road.
Before taking this action the coun
cil by ordinance abandoned all pro
ceedings to condemn a strip through
Mrs. Jean B. Stewart's land for such
road. Measures, it is likely, will be
taken to secure the city against the
lapse of Mrs. Stewart's dedication of
another strip for the proposed road.
Bids for laying plank sidewalk on
East Market street from C to D were
opened from John Strommer and A.
I H. Moulton, the contract being award

and from the 0.-W. that the city lend
them the big and little concrete mix
ers, for short projected Jobs, were

, department with 2,000 cords of wood
was awarded Phipps ft Watson at

ed to allow the permit to be given.
A protest from A. W. Featherljr
