A PROCLAMATION
By the Governor.
Day.
Bird and Arbor
The culture and growth of trees,
shrubs, flowers and all plant life is
both interesting and proütable. Out
of the Interest in arboriculture in its
various forms has grown the custom
of devoting a particular day of each
year to its promotion.
So, also, the protection of song and
Insectivorous birds is of interest and
practical value to all of us. While we
appreciate the charm of tlte birds and
their minstrelsy, we are prone to
overlook their services in destroying
Insects and small animals that prey
on farm crops, and too seldom take
thought for their preservation.
The cultivation of trees is in harm
ony with the protection of bird life,
and the two should go hand in hand.
Trees and shrubbery attract birds and
encourage them to tarry and rear
their young in the shelter soaflorded.
On the other hand, birds are the
great destroyers of the enemies of
tree and plant life.
To encourage the planting of trees,
shrubs, plants and (lowers, and the
protection and development of bird
life, I, Krank M. Byrne. Governor of
the State of South Dakota, do here
by designate and proclaim Friday, the
14th day of April, 1910, to be
ARBOlt AND BIRD DAY,
and urge the people of the state to
observe the day by making it the oc
casion for nurturing a sentiment in
favor of tree and plant culture and
bird protection, and by the actual
planting of trees, shrubs, vines, and
flowers ubout their homes, along the
highways-and ou the grounds of school
houses and other public buildings.
On farms and about country homes
—.where tree culture and bird protec
tion can be most effective and of
greatest interest do I particularly
recommend such planting and bird
protection, with a view to enhancing
the beauty ^and comfort of these
homes.
I call upon the schools and all edu
cational Institutions in the state to
observe the day jn spirit and in fact
by such appropriate ceremonies and
exercises as will fittingly recognize its
practical, historic and aesthetic signi
ficance, and by actual nlantlng In all
convenient places.
Witness my hand and the Great
Seal of the State of South Dakota af

Obituary of Mrs. Robt Cox.
Mrs. Robt. Cox, who was Miss Eliza
beth 11am, was born March 19th, 1843
at Blackford, England, and passed
from this life Feb. 29th, 1916 at her
home in Worthing, S. D. The deceas
ed spent her girlhood life in the land
of her birth and in young womanhood
at the age of 22 she was happl ly wed
ded to Mr. Robt Cox at Pilot, Eng
land. A few yeaip later they took pas
sage and came to America stopping
for some time In Wisconsin and later
coming to Dyersville, Iowa. Here
they made a home for about six years.
TLater on as many neighbors and
friends had done, they concluded to
come to the Dakotas, and they set
tled in Lincoln Co in 1870, and have
made their home here ever since
Several years ago Mr. and Mrs. Cox
rented their farm and moved to
Worthing to spend the rest of life in
less activities and especially to enjoy
church services, that were convenient.
Mrs. Cox has been ill for about five
months, an^ altho all that was pos
sible to be, done was undertaken, It
was of no avail and last Tuesday she
rested from her labors and passed to
the life beyond without fear.
Seven children were born to this
home, as follows: Alive Cox, deseased
Mrs. Eva Ciay, Worthing Mrs. Fan
nie Wallace, Thunder Hawk, N.
Mrs Annie Ende, Worthing Albert
E Cox, Sheridan, Ore Wm. J. and
Harry L. Cox, Worthing. Mrs. Cox
had four sisters and two brothers.
Some of these are in England and
some in this country.
Mrs. Cox was a most beautiful char
acter. She was early confirmed In the

member through herrartlily life. And
none graced her profession more faith
fully than she. She was a loving wife
and mother. She belonged to that
great array of meu and women who
never gain medals for heroic bravery
under great emergencies, but rather
do even greater things than these.
She was ever the patient, tender and
gentle spirit known by a small circle
about her as one possessed tf he true
virtues of womanhood and one whose
home was to her first of all. Her char
acter was beautifully reflected in the
tender unfailing care and nursing
given by her children the last lew
months, who left their homes and
many cares to make the last days of
the mother free from any care they
could by any means remove.
The family have passed through
forty years of Lincoln Co history.
Suffered the grasshopper scourges,
hardships and difficulties incident to
that period. The history of such
noble characters as these are full of
fragrant memories. There is some
thing beautifully heroic in the thought
of a home under these circum
stances, and especially when you thldk
of the wife and mother, facing the
unknown future and the many real
dangers and difficulties of the fron
tier life for the sole motive of love and
a home. Here she brought her babes
into the world and without the many
pleasant features of life that are so
common today, she tolled on, wanting
no greater reward than the joy of her
home and the treasure of children and
husband's love. Certainly the life
she lived and the inheritance she has
left to the husband and children will
be rich in all that makes for good
things In this life and in the life to
months full of pain and great weari
ness, she was the same gentle, patient
character and was a blessing to the
many friends who did all possible to
cheer the waning life.
The services were held at the Con
gregational church where Mr. and
Mrs. Cox have been faithful attend
ants for many years, and the Inter
ment was in Forest Hill cemetery at
Canton. Rev. Wm. S. Harper conduct
ed the funeral.

The First Marriage In County.
John H. Ovre and Jacob E. Holter
who live southwest of this c.ity were
partners in the Iron and copper mines
of Michigan for four years and in 1808
they started for Montana, after ar
riving In Sioux City they started up
the Missouri river afoot. Reaching
Vermillion footsore and weary they
stopped at the land office to find out
where they could find a good farm,
having walked the Montana fever all
out at this time. Mr. Stlckney re
ferred them up the Big Sioux river to
a place called and then known at that
time as the Trapper Shanty, which is
now Canton. They started out again
on Shank's railroad and pegged it 50
miles across the country of absolute
solitude. The first white man that
they saw was Buck Wheelock tenting
on the Eden bottoms. Mr. Ovre was
about discouraged but after a little
they located on the farm where he
now lives. For six months he could
not write home for want of a 5c pos
tage stamp. In course of time be
laid up enough money to send back to
Norway for his sweetheart and she
came here. Justice Werter S. Smith
married them in his old log house in
Canton, Oct. 13,1368. This was the
first marriage in Lincoln county.
Union Temperance Meeting.
The mass meeting held In the opera
house last Sabbath evening was very
largely attended showing the interest
taken in the question at the present
time. Miss Davison is a very enter
taining speaker and gave a practical
address. She showed how the mothers
of the land through the work of the
W. C. T. U. had instilled into the
minds of the children years ago the
truths that had in large measure
made the strong anti-saloon senti
ment of today. The educational work
of this institution and its influence in
Introducing instruction into the pub
lic school regarding the evil effects of
alcohol and tobacco had laid the
foundation for an intelligent cam
paign against alcohol as a beverage.
Her accounts of the honor of many of
our statesmen in refusing bribes in
the state legislatures and the Increas
ing opposition of all of our best citi
zens against the sale of intoxicating
Honors were encouraging in the ex
treme. It was the desire of Miss
Davison to organize a W. C. T. U. In
our city but she was unable to do
this at present. She gave a timely
warning against a dry city like Can
ton thinking it has nothing to do
next fall In the state wide campaign
for prohibition. If Canton will rally
all her dry votes in the fall and help
to make our state dry it will practi
cally settle the question of the "blind
pig." The blind pig straysdown from
Sioux Falls or over from Lennox pro
bable more often than he does from
sssüKrmr-aHF sev
cus~
the local sources. At any rate be
that as it may, if our state should go
dry we could make quick work of the
blind pig. He would have no hog pen
of a saloon to hide in and then we
could easily track blm to bis hiding
place wherever that might be and
there we could readily dispatch him.
It the state does not go dry next fall
the dry towns like Canton will be
more responsible for the defeat than
any other like number of places, for
the simple reason that tbey have
more dry votes. Let us not settle
down and congratulate ourselves that
we are a dry town and it does not
make any difference to us how the
vote goes. Let us remember that it
may be said of the political body as it
Is of the spiritual body that "if one of
the members suffer all the members
suffer with it." Canton has for years
declared by her attitude' toward the
open saloon that she thinks it is for
the best interests of her piople both
morally and financially to part com
pany with the liquor business. Shall
we not do our utmost to pass this
blessing on to the entire state?

Rey. Hicks says: Upon the whole,
we believe that March will be a "back
ward month." The Easter full moon
falls very late, that is, on Monday,
April the 17th, bringing Easter Sun
day on April the 23d. As a rule, a
series of rain and snows, followed by
high winds and blighting tempera
ture and frosts, are to be apprehend
ed within a period of five or six days,
taking the Easter full moon as center
of the period. Having passed the
Easter full moon and having escaped
the boreal storms and cold, blighting
winds and frosts 'that follow, as a
rule, there is reasonable safety from
killing frosts for that season. Hence
we hold that a late Easter betokens a
late spring or If not a spring of con
tinued cold, look for a late spell of
cold, blighting winds and weather
that will destroy for the most part all
the results of warm and budding and
blooming and growing weather that
may go before It.
