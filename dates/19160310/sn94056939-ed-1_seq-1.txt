In educational interest.
In order that this work may be
self'Supporting, publlo programs,

follow tho usual theatre program.
However, the publlo will bn wel
come- ut all times, without charge,
to attend the exhibitions of educa
tional films and slides civen durinu
the school sessions,
The admission to tho travelocue
series will bo set ut the lowest
possible figuro. Children will bo
admitted for five cents, adults for
ten cents. It Is possible that It
may bo found necessary, in later
numbers of tho course to slightly
raise the prlo of adults, but the
admission for children wilt not lie
raised above the figure given above.
Tho most remarkable advance In
oduoational linos in rocent years
has beou tho adoption of tho idea
of visual initiation, amiillfvliio
the old method of the text book
which, at tho best, is but a dry
procedure when used alone. The
Capitán school U sotting tho paco in
Lincoln County in this respeol, be
ing the first to make tho depar
turo from tho old methods. How
over, a number of the schools of
New Mexico have already adopted
tho new way, Santa Fo and Clovls
being among the schools which
have placed moving picture ma
chines In (heir schools this year.

NEWMEXICO GREATEST
AREA FOR CATTLEMEN
Largo Tracts of Unpatented
Public Land Makes N. M.
tho Leader in tho Produc
ing.End of Cnttlo Business
CHEAPEST PLACE IN THE
WORLD TO RAISE CATTLE
While ovnry cattleman worth his
salt knows that the old days, when
a man could turn loose a bunch of
cows on the rango and got rich
almost without effort, are past,
every one of the progresslvo cattle
men of today knows that the day
of the business ri.au engaged in tho
cattlo business, tho cattleman with
shrewd business training added, if
you plesse, Is Just dawning Especi
ally is this true In New Mexico.
ThU slate and Arizona, because
of their possession of large tracts of
unpaienicd publlo land, aro tho
leaders in the producing end of the
cattlo business Because of their
free grass they aro the ohoapest
places hi tlio world In whloh to
grow cat'le, for whatever may be
said abn'ift acreage being sottled up,
there remains the Inot that these
two stales have far moro free grass
left than ever will be open 'again or
ihan is open now in any other sec
ti.,n
It must bo conceded that until a
means of farming Is dtrvised which
will bring New Mexico's vast publli
domain into productiveness, stock
raiting will be a premier industry
in the slate, and further, there will
be a quantity of grazing land which
can be used free. This establishes,
then, that for n long period in
come, thore will bo freo ' rnngo iu
New Mexico.
Now in addition to this there
still are some good opportunities,
especially for tho small grower, on
the national forests. Cattlemen
have got over looking nt tho forest
servlco as a despnller of their rights,
for thoy have seen that they actu
ally benefit from it. As ono cattle,
man puts It, "My forpst grazing
permit Is ipy Insurance against a
bad year " Somo of these, proposl
Hons are for all-year round range.
othors oro for summer rango only,
aud need the development of winter
feed to makefhein valuable. Other
sections of forest rnngo nio not
available because of lack of water,
but tho development nf stock water
Is a matter which is receiving at
tentlun from forest servlco and
cattlemen alike, and It now appears
thai few portions of tho otherwise
good rango will go unused long be
cause of this lack.
The word "development" In tho
paragraph ahead Is the keynote of
tho bolo situation, Thore nro

Moxlon for development of a busl.

raiser and nf advantage to the com
muulty. Sumo of these opportuni
ties are chances to buy nut small or

aro worth today, and, by intensive
work, make them worth a much
higher figuro. The last few years

pays, and pays big. .
Another development that can be
carried out Is tho development of
water on tho public land, thereby
securing a quantity of rango for
cattlo which now Is untouched This
la regarded as a very important op
portunity, bull another develop
ment is to lócate on bits of rango
good for summer feeding and to
grow feed on sheltering lands for
winter feeding, at least of tho pov
erty.stricken stuff This phaso of
the Industry Is developing rapidly.
There oro something over 20 000
000 acres of pub'lo land in Now
Mexico, of which n goodly quantity
is st ato land, subjoal to lease or
purchass, Thero are a number of
opportunities on tho notional forests,
either for small outfits to sccuro
permits or for the buying of big
but run down outfits and bring
them Up to dale.
But to preform any of these ac
lions requires capital and business
ability. This Is in accord with tho
trend of the times, which Is chang
ing tho cattlo industry from n
gamble to a husmees proposition.

but one is csnentla). There aro few
opportunities for tho old lime "oat

chance But there are opportuni
ties aud to sparo for the modern,

are concerned, are in New Mexico
and always will be here
