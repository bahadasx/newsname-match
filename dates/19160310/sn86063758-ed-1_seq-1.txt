N Columbia. March 9.?Senator Jno.
L. IMcLaurin, State warehouse commissioner.
returned on a late tflain last
l night from the North, where he has
been -.or the past week, in company
wkh State Senator J. Arthur Banks,
of Calhoun county. I'pon his return
ii-p issueii a statement dealing with
; the situation as to cotton and referring
at some leng.h to the insurance
situation in South Carolina at this
k time.
A "I have just returned from New
York, Washington and Richmond." he

of the "urtlier enlargement and develop

I also took up the matter of insurance.
Be ore discussing ihat I desire to say
that I went over the cotton situation
very thoroughly with a number of
experts, and particularly with Mr.
Harding, of the Federal Reserve board.
Mr. Harding will make a speech Fri-<

will discuss at length the statistical
position of cotton, and also give some
valuable information from the British
k ambassador as to ihe situation abroad
and the effect of the various orders
promulgated by the British government
with reference to cotton. Mr.

sition o* cotton ivery strong, but on !
every side I was urged to advise the
farmers in the present situation not
to plant cotton except as a surplus
crop, to make their farms self-sustainf
ing. Another thing chat 1 am satisSed
of is that the necessity of pota?"n vms

T that much of the land in South Cark
lina, by deep plowing and the use or
H legumes, will continue to mafce eotton
without potash. The clay lands
are the ones to which I refer.
"Personally I do not believe that we
ft ran make a larse crop of cotton next
tyeai, with the small amount of fer.zer,
and it looks to me as if vhe !
war will be ended before the next crop
comes on the market. The Germans
1 have evidently made up their minds
^ not to fight a war of at rition, but are
I making the issue at Verdun, and from
all that I could gather the fight along
Meuse now in progress occupies very
much the position .hat t"e Battle o"
Gettysburg did in the War Between
the States. If the Germans lose this
(battle their only hope is to make tne
most favorable terras of peace that
they can get. and the reverse is true
as to the French and the English, because
this breach in the lines will put
v the German army between the French
and the English and ?>pen the road to
Paris.
1 1I11U ill > v? l l ix i'lcivxically
unanimous for the Allies e~B|
oept where you s.rike those of German
descent. There is -iot nearly so
much divisu 1 ci sennmeiu north of
^ the Potomac as there Is in the South.
There is a lingering feeling here
L that England's con rabend orders tia*.e
been a great blow to cotton, and jet
a cererui suiciy or iue suuauon aoes
L not bear this on . because the advance
last August which put cotton above
| 12 cents so as to give us a 10-cents
borrowing basis was strictly due to
K "he purchase of cotton by the British
government, off-setting as far as possible
declaring cotton contraband. <
r These purchases were the result of the
negotiations between officials in iWash
ington and the British ambassador, j
With the Federal reserve board dis-;
? counting warehouse receiDts at SO Der
L cent, of the value of cotton and the
British government purchasing heav-j
ily, coiton was bound to advance. I :
V do not know what effect the speech to
to be made by Mr. Harding on Fri-,
day will have, but when the cotton j
trade studies the figures which he
showed me I think that they will real- 1

torn. No one can doubt who knowts
the oreigti situation thai at the close
of the war here will be a sensational
ad.ance in the price of cotton. 1
never advise anybody to hold cotton.
That is a question for a man to decide
for himse'f. Cut 1 am going to keep
mine until ;he war ends.
i
As to the insurance suuauun, wc
parties who have been handling our
cotton expressed themselves as entirely
satisfied with ;he sitation. and
1 feel no uneasiness. The Laney-Odom
bill has been passed in other States,
and every time this action has been
t'nret'f] it< repeal by
13 l\ l~U. hivj iiu ? x. . _
the same methods that the Southeastern
is adopting in South Carolina, it
seems that they wish to . orce the c a 11 ins
of large loans, and through this
I ^
bring; sufficient pressure to bear on
the governor to get him to call an ex*
tra session to repeal the act. Times
are different now from what they have
been and so far as 1 am concerned,
j I am not willing to see a corporation
dictate 'he policies of the State of
' South Carolina. I have heretofore
l
suggested to the general assembly a
system of State insurance, and i' the
legislature were ca'led together T
should advocate this policy. The is
sue i45 made, and ccrtainly the State or
South Carolina has sufficient resources
! to take care of her citizens.
/
After having talked with government
i
! officials in Washington and with the
i governor of the Federal reserve board
in Richmond, and seeing the interest,
wliich the government is taking in the j
S welfare o the people, and what a,
; |
; great blessing this new Federal re- j
serve bank is, I feel a new love for a !
; Democratic form of government and !
i that it justifies the hope that in this i
insurance situation there is ample ;
power in our State government to protect
our people against "malefactors of
great wealth."
The people with whom I am dealing
say that they can place all of the J
large amounts of insurance in case j
withdrawals are sufficienr to threaten j
citizens of the State, and while It Is
nnt strietlv a nart of my duties as |
State warehouse commissioner. I am j
in this fight and am perfectly willing
to give .freely of my time and energy,
and am placing insurance now for
parties ^'ho are uneasy over the situation.
The insurance commissioner. Mr.
McMaster, has issued a circular ad
vising the farmers to organize mutual
insurance companies, and I heartily
second the suggestion. I have been
looking into this matter myself, and
will make a statement c'.iong this line
shortly. I do not see why, through
the S ate warehouse association which
we formed in January, we cannot oriranizo
mutual insurance companies to
carry the country property, and I am
today issuing a call for a meeting of
the excutive commit-ee o this association.
1 lie Southeastern is trying to
strike a blow at the Sta.e warehouse
system by advancing tne rates on
country property. I did not begin
this fight, but I do not propose to
quit, now that it has been forced, and
-c l Kor>L' mo ac T Tr.nnw
li tllC Idl UlCl 3 IYUI uav/ii uiv, MO ?. uuv |
they will, and -with Mr. iMoMaster's
aid ana his long experience, we can
organize those mutual insurance companies
in every county in !South Carolina.
The farmers of 'Anderson,
Oconee. Union. Newberry, Cherokee,
York, Chester, Fairfield, Marlboro and
Darlington are now getting insurance
on their dwellings and tenant houses
at less than 15 cents per one hundred
dollars, while the farmers in the o"her
counties o: the State "have been paying
one dollar and twenty cents per
hundred dollars. I find in looking over
ray mail this morning that in the county
of Lee orders have been issued to
ra.-e the country insurance from one
I
i
dollar and twenty cents to two dol- [ I
lars. ?
Now. I have been for twenty-five
years trying to better the industrial
condition of cur pccuic. and if they
will organize and make up their minds '
to stick, wo wi.l win this battle, which
will only be a fore-runner o-: greater
victories.
Another rer,von why insurance is so
high in South .Carolina is that there
are tco many companies and too many j
agcn:s. It looks to me as if when a ,
m;:n has failed to mke a li\ing in any i
other line of business, he either goes
into polities, selling books, or trying {
to write insurance. It would be a ;
2 )Cd tiling if a large number of these
t
companies would withdraw and aboi: j ;
two-thirds of the people now writing i
insurance to earn a living had to go j
to work at some useful, productive occupation.
In the hearings before 'he1,
legislative committe es the agent of h
'<'if of ;iie large companies said that ;
the expense of pitting insurance Into i
thp home offices of the companies was j v
about orty-one and eight-tenths per j
cent. This is caused by the number \ ,
of useless agents, all of whom have ro j ,
<ret a portion of thp premiums. It
does not cost but ten per cent, to ,
any insurance is handled in large
handle the S<atc warehouse insurance
and should not cost over that whereamounts.
Of course small amounts |
o insurance, widely scattered, are j
much more expensive, but if we can !
place the large, amounts, through the j
channels which I now control, and '
then will follow the suggestion of Mr. ji
M-Masier and organize those mutual? (
in every county, with a central office
r .
in Columbia, we can save around fifty (
per cent, of the amounts paid in prem- 1
iums to useless insurance agents. 1 (
do not Uiink the companies themselves
are getting too much, but it is -he :
cumbersome and expensive machinery 1
ihiougii which they have to work. If i
they would look at it sensibly and co- I
operate with us, we can gei along I i
without the S. E. U. A. If they do not, j
then we will provide an insurance i
system o.' our own. i j
Incidentally I will say that I know 1
of counties in South Carolina tha\ j 1
have to borrow money for current
county purposes. I have in mind one 1
rmnitv that has been navins: eight pel 1
cent. I-oans of this kind can be placed
readily at from three and one-half to 5
"four and one-half per cent. T realize ]
that this is none o" my business, as <
State warehouse commissioner, hut ^ 1
f
have this information, and I feel that 1
it is ray duty to let the people know it '
The truth of tlie business is that 1
our whole fiscal system in 'South Car- t
olina, both public and private, needs 1
overhauling and if we lay down in this :
figh I see no hope of the future.
I am standing pat.

This was the crucial vote of the j

leaders were uncertain. With j
victory in ihand they moved on to the
idoption of a special rule after four
lours* discussion o-f the McLemore
"esolution.
Again tliey carried the day?this

victory to a conclusion by tabling the
UcLemore resolution, 276 to 142. In
seven hours of tense, turbulent session,

charged that the president was confiding
