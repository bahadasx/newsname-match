1 ndon. London has, no doubt, add
ed many new Industries to its list
'since the war began, but few, pet
'haps, of greater Importance and fasci
nating interest than that of paper spin
ning and weaving.
! I have had the opportunity of see
ing some wonderful things In the way
of yarns and textiles manufactured
from paper pulp, and also of seeing a
demonstration plant at work spinning
threads of paper into twine fine
enough for gas mantles and strong
jenough to hold a ship.
! This wonderland Is to be found in
jSouthwark and at the works of the
TTextillte Engineering company, which
is ndw supplying British-made ma
chinery, made according to its pat
ents, for the manufacture of 'every
kind of thing Imaginable which for
merly was made of hemp and Jute
and flax.
"The things you see around you,"
isald Mr. George Seaton Mills, the
managing director of the company
"'are new, and yet they are not new
What I mean Is that the people of
China, In the days of Confucius, prob
ably twisted a strip of paper in the
fingers absent-mindedly and found it
had remarkable tensile strength, but
jwhat we have done Is to make that
idea into a practical proposition.
I 'The Germans, with their faculty
for Imitation, have spun paper for
years, but they never could spin It
tast enough to make It pay. We now
ibave found means of spinning the pa
per four or five times faster than the
Germans and of producing the goods
tour per cent cheaper."

Uses Ticket 20 Years Old.
Kansas City A man whose face
was white and drawn has Just ended a
long-delayed journey. He entered a
train at the Union station here and
after a while gave his ticket to the
conductor, who regarded It curiously.
The ticket called for a trip to Galla
tin, Mo., was Issued by the Wabash
& Pacific railway in 1886 and was
good still.
The passenger told his story briefly,
sadly. Twenty-nine years ago he was
traveling from Leavenworth to Galla

and bought a ticket to Gallatin when
he was arrested and taken back to
Leavenworth. Found guilty, he had

British War Office Gives Official Rec
ognition to the National Dish of
Scots Famed in Song
and Story.
London. Scotchmen all over the
world should thrill with delight at
the news that the war office at last
has given its official recognition to
their national dish, the haggis. With
the laudable object of making; the
trenches as homelike as -possible to
the Scottish troops, Mrs. Porter Brawn
of No. 16 Holland road, Kensington, is
raising a fund to provide for them
real Scotch haggis In bulk. It this
does not bring to them the scent of
the heather and the music of the burn
nothing will.
The haggis Is one of the few na
tional dishes which has retained its
splendid isolation. Except maybe on
Burns nights, or at private gatherings
of exiles from north of the Tweed it
is seldom seen in England. To Scotch
whisky and shortbread, especially the
former, the Southron has taken very
kindly, but to him the haggis is still
an alien, probably because it is still
too strong for his more delicate stom
ach. For the "great chieftain o' the
puddin' race," as Burns calls It, Is to
tho Sassenach a fearful and wonder
ful wild fowl. It Is made of a sheep's
heart, liver and lungs, with some of
the smaller intestines. These are sea
soned with pepper, salt and onions,
and the whole is chopped up fine, with
suet and oatmeal. Then the mixture
is rammed into the membrane of a
sheep's stomach and boiled. And this
it is which has helped to make Scot
land what she is today. Says Burns,
addressing the haggis:
But mark the ruatlc. haeels fed.
The trembling earth resounds his tread.
Clap in his walle nieve a blade.

An' legs an' arms, an heads will sned
Like taps o' thrlssles.
Evidently not bad stuff to fight on
And now Mrs. Brown's fund is to be
recognized by the war office. H.ir
rich and rare puddings are to go to
the front with the sanction of the
powers that be; and "Jock" and
"Tam" once again will sit around
their well beloved dish all hot from
the pot. And when they have eaten
of it, woe betido the "boche" that
comes within striking distance of their
"walle nleves." There will be dirty
work. For, as a Scotchman will tell
you, there Is all Scotland in the hag
gis. There is Bannockburn and Flod-
den Field and the Forty-Five. There
is the wind in the heather and the
plunge of the salmon stream.
With a bit of haggis on his dirk the
Scot can see In its stream the banks
and . braes o' Bonnie Doon and the
bonnie, bonnle banks o' Loch Lomond.
He will feel his foot once more on
his native heath, and there will be
sparks. But, as a brither Scot would
add, their "nleves" would be all the
more "walle" if Mrs. Brown would
only see to it that a proportionate
quantity of mellow "Old Orkney" were
sent to stir into the haggises.

to be tbe most deceptive of silver dol

The counterfeit ts said to "ring

was given to It by the use of glass.
The real point upon which detection
rests is tbe new appearance despite

"So they'll keop each other awake

Reardon by way of explanation.

Club Owners Surprised at Immense
- Amount of Money Spent ta Secure
Stars From Major Leagues
A Few Examples.
The liberality of th Federal league
toward its ball 'players left the club
owners of organized ball dam
founded when the Feds showed their
salary list at the recent peace meet
ing. A club owner In one of the ma
jor leagues stated that he was sur
prised .hen the Federal league offi
cials told of the thousands of dollars
thej' had spent on Inflated salaries.
In order to lure the players away
from the major leagues their salaries
were doubled and some ot them
tripled. According to the officials ot
organized ball, It was this unusual
extravagance ot the Federal league
which caused1 Its downfall.
A few examples of the Increase
which the Federal league gave In
salaries, shows that it was Impos
sible for the Federal league to ever
come out even financially. The fol
lowing table shows how much salary
some of the players received under
organized baseball and what the Fed
eral league paid them:
Organized Federal
Player Ball. League.
Tinker 15,500 $12,000
Campbell 8,200 8.600
Cooper 2,600 7,600
Flkenberg 4,000 8,600
Kault 2,000 7,mw
Seaton 2,600 8,200
Chase 6,000 8.0Q0
Not only did the Federal league sign
these players and many others at
these exorbitant salaries for long
terms, but it gave them bonuses ot
from $1,000 to $5,000 advances at the
time they signed.
Old, seasoned baseball men state
that the most prosperous days that
baseball has ever had could not afford
such high salaries. When the assem-
Joe Tinker.
bled National and American league of
ficials listened to the Federal league
men as they unfolded their tale of woe
they looked at each other In surprise.
An official of organized baseball
said: "They estimate that the Federal
league lost $3,000,000 In this venture.
I tell you that $4,500,000 or $5,000,000
would be nearer the mark. It was tne
biggest piece of folly I ever heard of
to Imagine that any baseball league
could live and pay the players sucn
salaries."
It Is estimated that more than sev
enty-five ot the ball players whom the
Federal, league enticed away from or
ganized ball with the big offer or
money received more than twice as
much as they received with organized
ball. This Item alone would represent
an annual expenditure of $225,000.
It can readily be seen now why the
big issue In the peace negotiations ts
the seventy or more players whom the
Federal league has under Iron-bound
contracts at these Inflated salaries.
Organized baseball has told the Fed
eral league club owners that they can
not hope to pay these salaries, even
if they take the players back. It Is
believed that the compromise will be
effected by organized ball paying the
greater part of the salaries to the
players they take, while the Federal
league must make up the balance.

John L.
The question asked most in pugilis
tic circles is: "Was John L. Sullivan
ever champion of the world?" This
has been answered in the affirmative
as well as the negative, noted critics
disagreeing as to whether or not Sul
livan really held the title. Tom An
drews of Milwaukee, a well-known
sporting authority, declares Sullivan
was In reality the champion. An
drews burrowed Into ancient pugilistic
history and unearthed tbe following
facts to uphold him in his contention:
In 1869 Tom Allen, heavyweight
champion of England, and Mike Mc
Coole, an American, fought for the
world's championship near St. Louis,
and McCoole won on a foul In the
ninth round. In 1873 Allen and Mc
Coole staged another battle and on
that occasion Allen was the victor.
That victory restored the champion
ship to him.
Late In 1873 Joe Goss of England
came to America and fought Allen
noar Covington, Ky. Goss won on a
foul in the twenty-seventh round. In
1880 Paddy Ryan fought Goss at Col
lier, W. Va., and won the decision In
the eighty-seventh round. February
7, 1882, John L. Sullivan met Ryan at
Mississippi City for $5,000 a side and
knocked out Ryan in the ninth
round.
Gosb beat Allen, Ryan beat Goss,
and Sullivan beat Ryan, so why
shouldn't Sullivan be looked upon as
tbe world's champion after his victory
over Ryan? asks Andrews.
Sullivan's victory over Ryan, and
the victories of the other champions
before Ryan and Sullivan were under
the old London prize ring rules, but
those were the rules that really gov
erned in those days, and It was under
these rules that champions were made
and , unmade. In further argument
that Sullivan was champion ot the
world Andrews cites these facts:

December 19, 1887, Smith and Kilraln.
an American, fought 106 rounds to at
draw in Isle des Souverains, France.
July 8, 1889, Sullivan and Kilraln mat
in Richburg, Miss., and fought- with
bare knuckles, as had Smith and Kil
raln. Sullivan defeated Kilraln in 7&
rounds, the battle lasting two hours
and sixteen minutes.
Smith was only the champion ot
England, asserts Andrews. The best
he could do against Kilraln was a
draw. Sullivan, however, beat Kil
raln, so why shouldn't Sullivan have
been entitled to the world's champion
ship without a question of doubt?
Some folks, mostly English were ot
the opinion that Charlie Mitchell
shared the championship honors with
Sullivan because he held Sullivan to
a 39-round draw In Chautilly, France,
but Mitchell didn't share the honor.
The championship was Sullivan's un
til he was beaten; a draw scored by
an opponent against the champion
does not halve the championship; The)
rule on this question is plain.
Sullivan's fight with Kilraln was too
