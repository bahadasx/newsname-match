Good Seed Corn.
Muoh depends on the quality
of our seed corn. One oannot
always tell by ths appearance of
ad ear whether it will grow or
hot. : Many poor stands of oorn
get oredited to the weather and
the orows that oould have been
prevented by testing the seed.
If ten ears plant an acre, it Is
easy to see the loss one dead ear
will oause. ' It Is so easy to take
three or four grains from each
seed ear and plant them where
they will grow. In a few days
we will know without any guess
work whether our seed is good or
bad. A box divided into small
squares with old paper trays, or
with strings tied aoross the top
at right angles, makes A good
teeter. Fill with' any material
that can be kept moist enough to
sprout corn, A few grains from
eaoh ear are plaoed in each
equare and the work Is done. In
a few days we will know whether
our oorn is alivs or dead.
In our work in the Normal
Sohool we use oloth seed oorn
testers. 8trips of bleaohed mus
lin 5 ft. da. long andjl ft. wide
are marked with lead penoil or
ink. First a line is drawn length
wise through the center of the
tester to 18 Indies of either end.
Every three inohes oross lines
are drawn. This giv?s us twenty
epaoes whioh are numbered.
Placing the grains in position
and rolling the tester up it is
ready to be moistened. This oan
be done by pouring water over
the tester or placing It so that

Planting A n d Pruning
Fruit Trees.
J. C. VaUlen, MlMoari College of kg
y rioalturs,
Fro.lt trees should be ordered
at oace it they art to be set out
this spring. ' Careful tests at the
Missouri Agricultural " Experi
ment Station have shown that
fall pntin is better, but if the
work was not done last fall it will
be better to do the work this
spring than to wait until next
fall and lose another year . of
growth...-'-
One-year-old trees that have
been properly grown are usually
preferable, but two-year-old ap
ple, pear, enerry, or Ameriosn
plum-trees may be used. Set
apple trees 25 or 85 feet apart
eaoh way; pear, peach or cherry
trees 20 feet; and plum trees
16 1-2 feet. V . v
Ths. bark will show just how
deep the young trees were bef&re
transplanting and they should be
reset to about the eame depth in
holes just deep and broad enough
to admit the roots in their natur
al position without any bending.
Cut any broken or diseased parts
from the roots and be sure that
the ends ars smoothly out in
stead of left ragged. Trees that
oannot be planted as soon as they
come must be heeled in to pre
vent the roots from drying out
or molding.;
Shake fine moist (not wet) soil
in between the roots and tramp it
firmly with the feet while the hole
U being filled, but be sura that
the roots are covered In a natural
position ' and not trampled into
bad posltious. After the toil has
been tramped In level with the
surrounding ground, an Inch or
two of loose earth spread over
the surf aoe will help to prevent
baking.
As most trees oannot be reset
without the loss of many roots,
the top must be trimmed accord
ingly or there will be more of it
than the remaining roots oan
support readily and even young
trees whioh are not transplanted
should .be pruned severely and
the proper shape given them.
The-one-year old tree which has
no side limbs should usually be
trimmed to make-it head out from
two to two and a half feet from
the ground. All side limbs of
peaoh trees should be out off
close to the trunk and tbe main
trunk should be shortened
Cherry trees should be so pruned
that only three, four or five
branohes are left, but none of its
branohes should bs out baok.
Well-branoned apple, pear,
and American plum trees should
have the main leaders out out to
form open epreading beads that
will let in the sunshine to aid in
ripening the fruit. Their aide
limbs should be so shortened that
they are only half or two-thirds
as long as at first. The number
of main limbs should be finally
reduoed to three, four or five
whioh are to form the framework
ot tbe tree, but It ie often better
to leave more limbs than this at
the end of the first season and
make final choioo of the limbs
that are to be saved at ths end of
another year. ' ,

The Advantages of Selling
Cream.
Some farmers are churning
butter and selling it for leee than
they would reoeive from the sale
of the oream whioh is used in
making the butter. Professor
C. H. Eokles of the Missouri
College ot Agrloulture points out
three very good reasons why it is
to the advantage of the Missouri
farmers to sell cream rather
than to make butter to be sold at
the looal store. (1) Selling oream
means less work for the women
than making butter. (2) The
oream will nearly always bring
as muoh as the butter and often
considerably more. (8) The
oream buyer offers a market for
any quantity of oream at any
time. .
Any system that will lighten
the duties of the women on the
farm with out decreasing the in
come should oertainly be adopt
ed. When oream is sold all that
is necessary is to see thut the
oream is cooled after being sepa
rated and to take it along to town
twice a week in winter and three
times in summer.
It may be that afw farmers'
wives will find special oustomeri
that will take the butter at a
prioe equal to that seoured for
cream but that does not apply to
many. Even then surplus butter
will be left on band at times.
Again there may not be enough
to supply the oustomers and dis
satisfaction will result. When
selling cream these troubles do
not come to annoy. Any quan
tity, 'muoh or little, can be sold
to tbe oream buyer at anytime
and oash reoeived on the spot.
Ae a rule, unless the home
made butter oan he sold at an
advantage price of 25 oents or
more, the year around the inoome
will be more if the oream is sold.
At an average of 25 oents the In
oome will be about the same but
large amount of work will be
saved by selling the oream. If
the farmer does not have a oream
separator he should get one If
four cows or more are milked. A
machine will more than pay for
itself within a year when 10 oows
are kept by the additional butter
saved. Four oows with a separa
tor will make ae much butter a
five of the same grade without a
separator. The fifth one repre
ssnts the loss in butterfat in the
skimmilk.

Alfalfa Grows Well on Most
. ; Missouri Soils.
Tests made by ths Missouri
Agricultural Experiment Station
and published in part In bulletins
recently Issued show that manure
and Inoculation are the two nec
essary soil treatments for ths
suooeesful production of alfalfa
in Missouri and that frequently
the use of phosphates is ad vis
able. Inoculation is generally
necessary on all soils that are not
overflowed. Some Missouri soils
do not need fertilizing, but most
of them will respond to manure.
Alfalfa Is adapted to practically
alt of Missouri soils szoept the
level prairiee ot the northeast
and southwest sections. C. B.
