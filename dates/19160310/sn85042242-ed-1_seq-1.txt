Rumors Renewed at London That
Turkey Is Seeking
Peace.
London, March 9.—Germany has
declared war on Portugal. Thus, 14
countries are engaged in the interna­
tional Struggle.
The declaration of war was made
by Germany, chiefly on account of
the recent seizure of German merch
antmeut interned in Portugese ports,
and Portugal's refusal to rescind this
action pud once more place the ships
under the German flag. A long ser­
ies of alleged breaches of neutrality
by the Portugese government also
were contributing factors.
German Residents Leave.
Large numbers of German resi­
dent are
suit of notices given by German con­
suls that they should quit the coun­
try as soon as possible.
(Fighting between the French and
Germans, northwest and north of
Verd»n, .has in no wise slackened.
Particularly violent has been the at­
tack of the Germans to the north of
Verdun around DoUaUmont, tho vil­
lage of Vaux, and Ft. Vaux, but ac­
cording to Paris, they- went' for
naught.
Solid Formation.
The Germans were thrown in solid
formation against trenches of tho
French bordering the foot of the
ridge dominating Ft. Vaux, which the
latest German official report said the
Germans had captured, but the
French drove back the attacking
forces Willi enormous losses.
In the eastern theatre, the Rus­
sians, at various points, have taken
the offensive against German ad­
vance positions, but Berlin declares
they nowhere met with success.
The foreign office has received no
oflicial advices that Turkey is seek­
ing peace. However, the impression
prevails, from what is known of con­
ditions in Turkey, that there is a
strong probability of an early move
in that direction.

Thousands of tons of hay have

New York, March 9.—Intimations

Col. Roosevelt, who is at Trinidad.
After declining emphatically to en­
ter the ^Massachusetts primaries as a
candidate, he wrote: "1 will not en­
ter any fight for the nomination. In­
deed, I will go further and say it
would be a mistake to nominate nic
unless the country has in its mood
something of the heroic, unless it
feels not only like devoting itself to
the ideals, but the purpose, measure
ably, to realize those ideals in Am­

NO MORE NEGOTIATIONS
UNTIL ANSWER ARRIVES
Washington, March !).—The United
States has asked Great Britain for
a copy of the confidential instructions
to commanders of Jj'ritish merchant
vessels, which Germany claims
proves that merchantmen armed of­
fensively have been instructed to act
offensively toward German subma­
rines.
The request is said to have been
made through Sir Cecil M. Wright,
the British ambassador. This is the
first stej) taken since administration
officials began studying the complete
memorandum in which Germany noli-,
lied the United Slates of its inten­
tion to treat merchantmen as armed
vessels of war.
There were intimations tonight
that the iBritisli government later
would be given an opportunity to an­
swer the German charges and to com­
ment on the 20 incidents where Ger­
many claims defensively armed ships
have acted offensively toward subma­
rines of the Central Powers.
It is considered unlikely, too, that
there will be any further negotiations
on the subject with Germany until
after a reply has been received from
Great Britain.
In the senate today, Senator Mc
Cumber withdrew his resolution to
warn Americans off armed ships, say­
ing it had served its purpose and to
press it further might embarrass the
administration.
Just before the senate adjourned,
Senator Vardaman, democrat, made a
bitter attack on President Wilson's
policy. His speech precipitated no
debate, however.
PASS RESOLUTIONS.
Washington, March 9.—The senate
today passed the Robinson resolution
for a congressional investigation of
the aviation service of the army, aris­
ing from charges against the conduct
of the aviation station at San Diego,
Cal. The resolution now goes to the
house.
Chicago, March 9.—It was unoffi­
cially announced here tonight that

men and trainmen of American rail­
roads overwhelmingly favored author­

tiations with the .railroads for an

Sir CASE
State Loses Action in United
States Court of Appeals
LOCAL COURTS UPHELD
STATE CHEMIST S STAND
Tobacco Questioned is Not Snuff
Says Judge in His
Decision.
St. Louis, Mo., March 9.—The Unit­
ed States court of appeals at St. Lou­
is today ordered the issuance of an
injunction against E. F. Ladd, state
chemist and food commissioner of
North Dakota, to prohibit him from
carrying out threats of prosecution
against tobacconists selling a certain
make of tobacco, which one set of ex­
perts has pronounced to be snuff and
another set has declared to be mere­
ly chewing tobacco.
The decision is a victory for the
Weyman-Bruton Tobacco company,
which failed to get the injunction in
the United States district court of
North Dakota.
The court, in issuing its opinion,
defined both forms of tobacco. The
importation or sale of snuff in North
'Dakota is strictly prohibited under a
penalty of a fine of not less than $&0U
nor more than $1,000 for the first of­
fense and imprisonment for six
months for each succeeding offense.
Judges Adams, Garland and Trieber
heard the case on appeal and Judge
Trieber handed dow nthe opinion in
favor of the Weyman-ETuton Tobacco
company and against State Food Com
missloftef1•MrtM
Called It Snuff.
In the United States district court
of 'North Dakota, where the case was
first tried, Ladd was given the de­
cision. The opinion of the court of
appeals, therefore, was a reversal ot'
this decision. The Weyman-Bruton
Tobacco company manufactured "W.
B. Fine Cut Chewing Tobacco," which
it sold throughout North Dakota.
Ladd held this tobacco was snuff and
that it was intended to be taken in
the nose or to be held in I he mouth
for absorption. 'He accordingly he is­
sued circulars to tobacconists, warn­
ing them against the penalty which
would result from its sale.
Claimed It Was Tobacco.
The tobacco company, however, de­
clared its product was not a snuff, but.
a fine cut chewing tobacco.
Jn his opinion, Judge Trieber le­
gally defined snuff and line cut chew­
ing tobacco for the lirst lime since
Sir Waller Raleigh popularized the
use of the weed.
"Snuff," he declared, "is tobacco
which has been fermented, which is
powdered or pulverized and which is
primarily intended to be taken by the
nose, but also may be taken in the
mouth." Fine cut chewing tobacco,
according to the judge, "is tobacco
prepared or cut from manufactured
plug or twist tobacco, or from tobac­
co scraps, cuts or clippings and which
is practically intended to be used ex­
clusively as chewing tobacco."
The brand of tobacco in question,
the judge declared, was of long fibre
and was not pulverized. It was ad­
vertised as chewing tobacco and wafe
intended to be irsed as such. Ac­
cordingly, he reversed the opinion of
the lower court.

•Upon their refusal to accede to the
request, which is taken as a fore­

Washington, March 9.—Washing­
ton stands squarely behind Col. Slo
cum in sending his cavalrymen into
Mexico in pursuit of ihe bandits who
raided Columbus, N. M., today, mur­
dering citizens and liiing the town.
Secretary Lansing tonight informed
the de facto government of Mexico,
through Eliseo Arredondo, its ambas­
sador-designate here, that he trusted
no objection would be made to the
action of the American troops, they
having followed what is known in
military circles as a "hot. trail." No
orders have been issued for the re­
turn of the soldiers, and ii is not.
probable any will be issued for the
present.
Indignation Felt.
Sharp indigantion, occasioned by
news of the Villa outrage, was suc­
ceeded quickly by undisguised satis­
faction in official ami congressional
circles over the knowledge that after
three years of patient forebearance,
United States troops actuany were
on Mexican soil, to bring to justice
the outlaw whose depredations have
the border.
Five Troops Cross Over.
Reports that the American troop­
ers were in action tonight probably
fifteen miles south of the border,
against a much larger force of ban­
dits, were heard with anxious inter­
est in official circles. Five troops of
cavalry crossed the border early in
the day. At a late hour tonight it
was not known officially just where
they were or what account they had
given of themselves.
To Urge Intervention.
In congress, administration leaders
will seek to curb debate on Ihe sub­
ject, but will not be surprised if
there is difficulty tomorrow in re­
straining opponents of the adminis­
tration. Senator Fall or New Mexico,
long an advocate of intervention,
and consistent critic of the president:,
tonight announced his purpose of in­
troducing resolution for recruiting
500,000 volunteers to intervene in
Mexico at the earlist possible mo­
ment. It is known, too, that other
senators have in contemplation reso­
lutions toward the situation in Mexi­
co.
Copenhagen, March 9.—The first
meeting of the conference of the pre­
miers and foreign ministers of the
Scandinavian countries was held to­
day. Nothing definite is expected to
result before Saturday, which prob­
ably will be the concluding session.
The suggestion persists that the
conference may be the forerunner of
a complete understanding, if not an
active alliance of all the neutral coun­
tries in dealing with the belliger­
ents.

-1ST DEGREE MURDER
St. Paul, March
9.—Mrs.
Aniela Du-
dek of Minneapolis who shot and
killed Rev. Henry Jasieske at St.
Casimir's Polish Catholic church here
last Saturday night:, was charged
with first degree murder in an in­
dictment returned late today by the
Ramsey county grand jury. Mrs.
Dudefc, who is being held at the
county jail here, will answer to the
indictment in district court next Mon­
day. The funeral of Father Jajeske
was held today,
50
priests assisting
in the ceremony. Mrs. Dudek has as­
serted she shot the priest because he
had wronged her. It is understood
insanity will be her defense.
Machine Cans
Fail To Work
El Paso, March 9—Failure of the
machine guns to work at the crucial
time, when most needed at the be­
ginning of the fight between the Villa
bandits and the Kith cavalry at Col­
umbus early this morning, is the
cause attributed for the escape of
the Villa forces across the border,
and also for the relatively small loss
of life among them, according to Pri­
vate Thomas Barton, of the hospital
corps, who with Private E. M. John­
son, brought five wounded privates
and one officer to El Paso this after­
noon.
According to the men the attack
began near the edge of Columbus.
There were 110 guns or weapons of
any kind in the hospital. Johnson
said he killed one Villa bandit with
an axe, which he threw as the Mexi­
can passed the hospital shouting
"Viva Villa."

Columbus, N. M., March 9.—'Mrs.
•Maud 'Hawk Wright, an American
woman, who said she was hold cap­
tive by Villa for nine days and was
liberated in Ihe midst of today's light­
ing, declared late today that Villa an­
nounced, March 1, his intention to
attack Columbus and proceeded north
under forced marches to carry out
his purpose.
Men Suffer Severely.
•Mis men, with scant .supplies ot
water and food, suffered severely and
many dropped from their horses on
the march to Hoca Grande. Villa,
she declared, ruled them by tear and
his officers with the flat, of their
swords beat, the soldiers into anima­
tion sufficient, to reach that, point,
where they rested and prepared for
the raid.
Tuesday, :Mrs. Wright related, Villa
bandits attacked employes of the Pa
lonias Cattle company engaged in
rounding up cattle, killing four Amer­
icans.
Gave Up Her Baby.
Mrs. Wright, said her husband, lid
win .1. Wright, formerly of Houston.
Texas, and (Frank Hayden, a youth
employed at the La Booker sawmill,
were taken from the Wright ranch
March 1, and, presumably, killed.
When she was taken prisoner and
forced to ride away with a detach­
ment of Villa's men, under Col. Nich­
olas Servantes. she said a bandit or­
dered her to give her baby to a Mex­
ican family.
Mrs. Wright was cared for today
at the home of Mrs. Slocuni, wife of
the general commanding the 13th
Cavalry. There she told the story of
her capture and her experiences from
the time she was taken from the
ranch at Colonial Hernandez, west of
Pearson, where the de facto Mexican
government was reported to have
maintained a heavy garrison for the
protection of Americans.
Rode Mule First.
Up to yesterday, she said. Villa
wore citizen's clothing, a queer little
round straw hat, and rode a small
mule, but just before the fight this
morning, he appeared clad in the mil­
itary uniform he wore at Juarez, and
rode one of three handsome sorrel
chargers, which had not been ridden
during the long march.
Only 300 American Soldiers.
•Mrs. Wright said Villa led nearly
1500
men upon the sleeping Ameri­
can town, at which were quartered
less than
300
American troopers.
She said that some of the men de­
tailed to guard her during the march
north told her Villa had 3,000 men
and 6,000 horses.
"It appeared to me he had twice
that many men and horses," she add­
ed.
Just before she and her husband
were taken prisoners with the ayden
boy, Mrs. Wright said, the Villa men
told her they had raided Colonial,
Juarez, an American Mormon settle
mnet, west of Pearson, looted all
stores of flour and provisions and
killed some of the foreigners. She
had learned nothing further in cor­
roboration of this story, she said.

IN PURSUIT OP VILLA
Mexico City, March 9.—"My government sincerely re­
grets this affair and asks the American people to be pa*
tient,'' said Marcelino Davalos, who is acting as foreign min
inster of the Carranza cabinet, in a statement to the Asso*
cated Press today.
"The government asks the American people to remem­
ber that Villa is a common enemy," he continued, "and an
outlaw to be hunted down by all men. The Mexican govern­
ment will use the most vigorous means to run this man to
earth and avenge his horrible acts.''
It is stated officially that General Trjayina, with a large
force already is in pursuit of Villa.
The .American pursuit into Mexico was reported to have ac­
counted for more than 75 Mexicans killed and wounded.
Francisco Villa, the Mexican bandit, raided United States terri­
tory today. With 500 men, he attacked Columbus, killed at least 16
Americans and lireel many buildings, before he was driven back
across the border. .At least. 250 troopers of the 13th United States
cavalry followed the Villa band into Mexico.
PRIVATE KILLED.
Keporls lo Col. II. -I. Slocuni late today stated that Villa had
made a stand 1.5 miles south, of the border, where spirited fighting
ensued. Tn this engagement, an unnamed private was killed, and
Captain (Jeorge Williams, adjutant, of the 13th cavalry, was wound­
ed.
The small detachment of troopers under Majors Frank Tomp­
kins and Elmer Lindsley fighting dismounted, made a determined
stand against tho renewed Villa attack and at last reports were
holding their ground.

Coluii]i|)us, March !).—The two hours* invasion of the United
States at this point early today by bandits under the outlaw, t^ap
eiseo Villa, resulted as follows:
Eight American civilians were slain, including one woman.
Eight American soldiers of the 13th cavalry were killed.
Other American civilians and soldiers were injured.
Villa's losses are estimated at about 150 killed and 200 wounded,
-r ... rIN,PURSUIT. ...
After two hours' fighting in this town, in wfoich a number of
buildings were burned, the United States soldiers drove the Mexi­
cans across the bolder, and pursued them fifteen miles into Mexican
territory.
The casualties ot' Ihe 13th cavalry in the fighting in Columbus."
were seven killed and six wounded.
Villa's total losses in the day's fighting were estimated in excess
of KM) killed and twice as many wounded.
American territory proved costly to the bandit
chieftain. The bodies of 18 Mexican bandits, including Pablo, sec­
ond in command, had been gathered and burned before noon and
troopers reported an undetermined number of dead still lying in the
brush.
"DEATH TO THE AMERICANS"
Leading the attack under the slogan "Death to the Americans,"
Villa's followers fought with desperation. Just before dawn they
crept, along ditches skirting the cavalry camp and rushed on the
sleeping town and fired heavily.
The first volley brought American trooper's into immediate ac­
tion. While a portion of the raiders engaged the cavalrymen others
detailed by the bandit chieftain began applying the torch and shoot­
ing American civilians who ventured from buildings. Lights in pub­
lic buildings and homes became targets for snipers of Villa's forces.
Other bandits, creeping close to homes, enticed a number of ci­
vilians into the open with Englis/h spoken invitations. A number of
fatalties are attributed to this ruse.
STORES ARE LOOTED
Stores were looted, oil was poured upon frame structures and
the match applied by still other bandits. The postoffice was raided
and furniture smashed, but the looters obtained only one small regis­
tered package.
Many civilians barricaded themselves in their homes and fired
at the Mexicans as they darted through the streets.
The fighting in the town ended almost as suddenly as it began.
Less than two hours after the first shot was fired buglers sounded
recall, and the raiders began a disordered flight, followed closely by
American troopers.
THREE TROOPS ON BOUNDARY.
Three troops of cavalry were posted on the boundary tonight.
A battalion of infantry, and a squadron of the Eighth cavalry from
Ft. Bliss left El Paso late today to reinforce the troops here. "With
these forces, Col. Slocum said lie could handle any further attacks
Villa in desperation might decide to make.
The day's events were accepted as confirmation of recent re
ports, which have been numerous, that Villa, disgruntled at Wash­
ington's attitude in favor of his rival, General Carranza, had deter­
mined to bring about intervention, if possible, and this rather
robbery was the motive behind the massacre west of Chihuahua.
"The United States intends to swallow Mexico," a
fugitive
quoted Villa as saying. "Let us do what we can to make
it stick in
their throats."
