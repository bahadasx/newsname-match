BUY EARLY
"THE effect of the great war on
1 , Men's Clothing will be felt
this spring still more next fall.
We have had to buy with greater care and discrimination
ihan ever, to protect oar customer against poewfabrics.
That's why we appreciate having a line of medium
priced clothes for men and young menthat is absolutely de
pendable Clothcraft.
Every piece of cloth that enters the factory is tested me
chanically to determine its strength and chemically to prove
its ingredients. This is but the first:of a long series of safe
guards that protect Clothcraft values 4
But don't wait toc long, there'll be greater demand this
spring for nationally known value like Clothcraft. Buy early
Clothcraft Clothes $10 to $20
