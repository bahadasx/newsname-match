number were present and spent a
most delightful evening.

: Base Ball Meeting
About fifty were present at the
meeting held-at the Woodman hall
last Friday night to take steps to
furnish some financial backing to
the base ball team this season. H.
E. Maybee was chairman and A.
J. Cay wood, secretary of the meet
ing. A committee composed of
Superintendent Crookshank-, F. R
Power and H. E. Brennerwas ap
pointed to see where suitable
grounds could be secured.' An
organization was perfected by the
election of H. C. Carothers, presi
dent; Max Jones, secretary and J.
H. Nichols, treasurer. Those in
charge of the meeting and the
offieets elected made it plain that
whatever assistance was given the
team it would be with the under
standing that no Sunday games
were to be played and no one on
the team who played Sunday ball.
The high school team was present
and arrangements made for both
clubs to use same grounds. There
are enough players here to have a
first class team, the only question
being whether they ill be willing
to -cut out Sunday playing. There
seems to be a general inclination
among the people of the town and
community to give better support
and encouragement to the team
this year than ever before and if
the plans now under way mature
there will be some good games
here this season.

In his advertising matter Ralph
Parlette, who is to lecture at the
opera house next Monday night
under the auspices of the Parent
Teachers association, says: If

To Increase The Oats Yield
t
The 0. A. Talbott grain com
pany, with the general offices for
Missouri territory in Laclede, is
making an active effort to help the
farmers to increase the oat yield in
North Missouri. Recently the
Missouri agricultural bureau got
out a limited edition of a bulletin
containing some valuable informa
tion in regards to the selection of
seed oats and the preparation of
the seed bed but as the funds for
the printing and distribution had
been exhausted the Talbott cam-
pany, at their own expense, had
an edition of 500 copies printed
and are mailing them out from this
office this week. C. B. Talbott.
manager in the Missouri territory,
is devoting much time to the work
with the sole object of increasing
the yield by calling the attention
of. farmers to the importance of
testing the seed for gemination
before sowing. Tests that have
been made show that only a small
per cent of the 1915 crop will
germinate and it behooves the
farmers to be careful about the
seed if they would have anything
like a full crop this year.
