YOUNG MAN
TAKES OWN LIFE
Carroll L. Dudderar Returns Home
from Horse Sales Despondent
and Ends It All.
Carroll L. Dudderar, one of the
best known young men of Stanford,
took his own life about nine o'clock
Thursday morning at the home of his
aunt, Mrs. George F. DeBorde and
Mr. DeBorde. The young man swal
lowed about an eighth of an ounce
of strychnine, and died in a short
time afterward, in terrible convul
sions. He was conscious almost up
to the moment of death, but gave no
reason for the rash act. He had
come home Wednesday night, how
ever, despondent, after spending a
couple of weeks in Lexington, Louis
ville and Frankfort, and it is believ
ed that as a result of his condition,
"his mir.J was temporarily unbalanced
and he took the fatal step when not
at himself.
News of the young man's death
spread like wild-fire over town and
sympathy fojr the relatives is wide
spread. Ordinarily of a genial and
friendly nature, the young man was
a general favorite, and numbered his
- friends by his acquaintances. He
was easily one of the best horsemen
in the saddle horse business in this
section of the state, and liked nothing
better than to be astride a good ani
mal. He had great success in hand
ling them and could get every ounce
of worth out of one in the show ring.
A number of local gentlemen put
"horses they had for sale in his charge,
when he went to Lexington ten days
or two weeks ago to the sales there.
They were sold well, and the local
owners received checks promptly for
their animals. Mr. Dudderar sold
two of his own at the same time and
though he was expected back immedi
ately, did not come, but spent the
lime with friends in several cities.
Mr. and Mrs. DeBorde and Fox Dud
derar, his uncle, had made inquiries
for him, and were beginning to be
come uneasy. He came in on Train
No. 21 Wednesday night, however,
and found Mr. and Mrs. DeBorde
Avaiting up for them. To them he
talked rationally for a few minutes,
but remarked to hjs aunt that he
felt very bad. She made him go to
bed, which he readily agreed to do,
saying that he would get up in- the
morning and put everything in shape.
Thinking he needed sleep, Mrs. De
' Borde did not call young Dudderar
for early breakfast, but let him
sleep, and about eight o'clock went
upstairs to his room and found him
awake. He complained of feeling
very badly, and she told him to come
down and drjnk a cup of coffee and
he would feel better. She left him,
and went to the kitchen. Shortly
afterward he appealed at the kitch
en, clad in nothing but his' night
clothes and a dressing gown and said
that he wanted a striped coat to put
on. Mrs. DeBorde saw that he was
not at himself, and persuaded him to
return to his room to dress. Mean
while she went into another room to
clean up, and shortly afterward
heard him calling her. She went into
his room, and found him suffering
greatly, and he informed her that he
had taken poison. Thinking that he
was joking, Mrs. DeBorde told him to
quit talking that way and to get up.
Again he assured her that he had
taken poison and told her to look in
his pants' pocket and she would find
the empty bottle. She made a search
and found a bottle, with just enough
strychnine left in it to cover the bot
tle. He told her that he had drank
the rest.
Mrs. DeBorde immediately sent
for her husband, who was in the
courthouse, and he ran to Dr. W. B.
O'Bannon's and secured that physi
cian and a stomach pump, and then
got Dr. J. G. Carpenter. By the time
the physicians got to work, the young
man was suffering horribly, going
from one convulsion to another, with
brief lucid intervals, and although
the contents of his stomach were
emptied with the stomach pump, such
a quantity of the poison had been
taken that it had gotten in its deadly
Avork all too soon and he passed away
within a few minutes, despite every
thing that could be done for him.
Carroll Dudderar would have been
23 years of age within a very short
time, and was the only son of the
late Will Dudderar, who was a son
of the late Col. Huff Dudderar, one
of the best known citizens of Lincoln
county in his day. The young man's
mother, was a daughter of Mr. Peyt
Parrish, of the Preachersville section.
He was their only child, a.nd after
the death of his parents, was reared
by Col. and Mrs. Dudderar and since
their death a few years ago, had
made his home while in Stanford with
his aunt, Mrs. DeBorde, who was al
most a second mother to him, and
did everything for him in her power.
He was the pet of all the large fam
ily, who .have the deepest sympathy
of the entire community in this hour
of their affliction and bereavement.
Owing to the distance which some
of the members ofthe family will
liave to come, funeral services will
not.be held until Saturcaj afternoon
at 2:30 o'clock; Services will be
conducte 1 b' Rev. D M. Walker, in
terment following in Buffalo Springs
cemetery, j'lie pallbearers will be:
Active-jPtewart Carson, Carl Car
ter, Frank Phillips, Robert Carter,
.Prescott Brown and Bryan Perkins;
Honorary J. N. Menefee, Jr., W. O.
"Walker, S. M. Saufley, R. S. Scudder,
J. C. Bailey and R. B. Woods.
Mr. Dudderar was a member of
Diadem lodge No. 81, Knights of
Pythias, and the members of the or
der -will march in a body to the
" -fgrxve, 'and -have charge of the cere
monial there.
Q. & C. PAYS OPTION MONEY
To Land Owners at Bowen and May
Move Division Soon.
The plans of the Cincinnati South
ern railroad to move the division
headquarters from Danville, to Bow
en, Lincoln county, seem to well un
der way. One of the best indications
that there is "something doing" is
that the Danville papers have not had
a word to say about the matter,
whereas when such a proposition has
been mentioned before, they have al
ways hooted at the idea. The Junc
tion City Picayune, which is right
on the ground, had the following to
say in its last issue:
"The Q. & C. has paid the security
monqy to the land owners along their
tracks between here and Bowen. We
feel that this great railway system
will carry out the plans which is said
to be the putting in of yards, build
ing new shops, making their, own
water supply, and making this the
terminal for all trains and crews be
tween Cincinnati and Chattanooga.
We are willing and heartily in favor
of the road doing a part or all of the
above, and they should have the
hearty support of the citizens here
and between here and Bowen in any
project, large or small, that they
might wish to undertake."
General News Notes
"Miss Ethel Hogue, and Ed Newell,
were married at the Bell Hotel at
Liberty last week.
Mrs. Harvey Hines, a prominent
woman of the Science Hill section of
Pulaski, is dead of tuberculosis.
Mrs. Lou Ann Moore, aged 110
years, is dead at Ashland. She died
knitting, having spent a great por
tion of her latter years knitting
yarn socks for sale.
Rev. William Ross Lloyd, of Lex
ington, has been secured to fill the
pulpit of the Christian .church in
Danville while Dr. H. C. Garrison is
trying to regain his health in Flor
ida. In order to satisfy citizens in
counties where a commission is de
sired to handle road bonds voted bv
the county, the legislature this week
passed a bill to make"" it legal for fis
cal courts to appoint commissions to
handle road-bond funds.
Approximately a billion and a half
dollars for new ships and an annual
upkeep charge of $760,000,000 is
what Admiral Fletcher, commanding
the Atlantic fleet, estimates it would
cost to carry out the Navy General
Board's recommendation to give
America the most powerful fighting
fleet in the world by 1925.
Mrs. Mattie Arthur, of Richmond,
a widow with four small children was
sentenced to the county jail for ten
days and fined $00 op a "bootleg
ging" charge. After court, Police

from various offenders.
A "boozless car" has been put on
the interurban plying between .Cat-.
lettsburg and Huntington, W. Va.
Catlettsburg is a wet town and the
whole State of West Virginia is dry.
The interurban is used by many of
those who want a little whisky for
the stomach's sake. Some of those
who go after it get too much on the
inside and these are not permitted
to ride in the "boozeless" trailers.
The innovation is found satisfactory
to all concerned.
Sheriff Craig Jones, of Owen coun
ty, who failed to renew his official
bond on the first Monday in Janu
ary, has resigned and Lee Kemper,
one of his deputies, has been appoint

cuit court, but his act was illegal un
der the circumstances and Judge
Gaines discharged it and had another
summoned by an official with author
ity. With the important sections struck
out by the Senate back in the bill the
Kentucky House passed the Knight J
Workmen s Compensation Act. On
the motion of Representative Greene
the members voted to hold three ses
sions daily hereafter. Last night the
Hutchcraft bill looking to the revi
sion of methods of assessment on
property was considered, but was not
acted upon. The Senate passed the
Combs bill authorizing submission to
the people of an amendment to the
Constitution proposing woman suf
frage in Kentucky. -

test held at McKiney last Friday eve
ning was one of the greatest succes
ses ever accomplished in this part
of the county, and in spite of the in
clemency of the weather, a splendid
crowd was present. The beautiful

held, was simply, but artistically dec
orated. At the appointed time, 19
members of th3 society, dressed in
white and wearing a banner with the.
name of a dry state on it, marched in1

took their place in the choir. They
were followed by the contestants,
namely: Mesdames John Grider, John
McKinney, Sara Dayton and Fred
Gooch, and their president, Miss

with ease and dignity and so well
were their parts rendered that the
decision was indeed very difficult and

entitled "Uncle Sam's Flower Gar
den," was given by 13 children from

could never be served. After the
play, Mr. McKechnie made the pre
sentation speech and delivered the
medal to Mrs. Gooch, whose subject
was "America Needs Men." Not only

by Julius McKinney and the well
known colored chauffeur, William

At Mt. Vernon and Brodhead
Boone Way Is Pushed.
If
Rockcastle men here this week say
that one of the first pikes to be built
with the bond money voted for good
roads by that county will be the con
tinuation of the Boone Way from the
Lincoln county line, east of Crab Or
chard, on to Mt. Vernon, through
Brodhead. A surveyor is now work
ing on the pike from Mt. Vernon to
ward the Lincoln county line and A.
E. Albright, of Brodhead, is assisting
Magistrate Wm. Hurst in securing
rights of way from Brodhead to the
Lincoln line. It is the plan to build
the pike on a better grade than the
old road and to dodge one or two
hills, which will make much smooth
er going. Lincoln people who at
tend the splendid fairs at Brodhead
and Mt. Vernon each year 'hope that
they will be able to travel to both
this fall in the autoes, which they
can do if the Rockcastle officials will
push work on the Boone Way, which
it is understood they will do, as soon
as the weather opens sufficiently.
