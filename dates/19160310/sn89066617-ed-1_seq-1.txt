LITTLE RIVER
ASKS COURT TO
OVERRULE HAYS
Wants Tribunal To Give In
To Drainage District In
$100,000 Bridge Suit.
HAYS IS FIRM FOR
COUNTY'S PROTECTION
Attorneys Seek To Lift Injunction
By Means Of A
Compromise.
An attempt tc persuade the County
Court to overrule its attorney, Judge
Edward D. Hayy, was made yesterday
afternoon by attorneys for the Little
River Drainage District in an effort to
effect a compromise leading to a pro
visional suspension of the county's in
junction restraining the drainage dis
trict from cutting the roads of Cape
County for its ciitches.
The court's decision on the question
raised will be handed down Friday, the
members of the bench stated. The
litigation is the largest in the county's
recent history, involving more than
?100,000.
Judge Hays, as the County Court's
attorney, obtained an injunction
rgainst the drainage district restrain
ing the district and its contractors
from cutting Cape County roads in the
excavation of the Main Diversion
channel across ihe southern side of the
county, until the liability for the
bridges was fixed by the court. The
County Court takes the position that
the Drainage District should pay the
cost of the bridges and the drainage
district contends that the county
should bear the cost of the bridge
building.
Six bridges costing approximately
$100,000 will hav? to be erected as the
main diversion channel of the Drain
age District taps the roads running
north and south in C2pe County.
Since the injunction order was is
sued and held inviolable by the Su
preme Court of Missouri, the attorneys
for the Drainage District, Oliver & Ol
iver, have been seeking to compro
mise with the County Court, whereby
a provisional suspension of the penal
ties for violating the injunction to al
low the ditch to be dug, the bridges
erected at the Drainage District's ex
pense, and the litigation over the ques
tion of liability "arried to the finish in
the courts with a settlement at its
close.
The attempt to persuade the County
Court to overrule Judge Hays grows
out of the rigorous demands he is ex
acting from the Drainage District in
effecting the compromise. He has de
manded, as attorney for the court,
things to which the drainage district
has not yet yielded and the hearing
before the court was obtained through
Hays as a last resort in an endeavor
to affect the compromise without mak
ing the concessions Hays demands .
The history of the litigation best il
lustrates the demands that Judge
Hays has demanded of the Drainage
District, and the account of the action
is briefly as follows:
The County Court on September 15,
last, formally employed Judge Hays as
attorney to co-operate with Prosecut
ing Attorney J. Henry Caruthers in
looking after the county's interests
and protecting the county from an un
due expense in building bridges over
the ditches cut by the drainage dis
trict.
The drainage district took no steps
to obtain the consent of the County
Court to cut the county roads and ar
range for the payment of bridges, but
rather, Judge Hays explained, took
the position that the district would not
pay for them and would go ahead and
cut the roads.
This position -was what inspired the
suit for an injunction to restrain the
district from cutting highways until
the liability for payment had been fix
ed. (Continued on page 5)

Painters Say Americans Friends
Are Best On Earth- Strong
For Cape.
George and Harry Blore, the si;m
painters and decorators, who are said
to be the only subjects of Great Brit
ain in Cape Girardeau County, are go
ing to take out naturalization papers
at the next term of the Federal Court
in this city.
This announcement was made by
George Blore last night. "We have
planned to become citizens of the
United States for several years," he
said, "and agreed upon our return
from the South two weeks ago, to
throw off our allegiance to England at
the first opportunity.
"Since we came to the United
States, we have found that it is the
best place on earth. Cape Girardeau
is our home and it will always be. Our
bst friends are here and in order to
make good citizens, we want to be
Americans.
"During the winter, as has been our
custom, we worked in the South. We
nave decided to remain in the Cape
both winter and Fummer in the future.
We propose to establish ourselves
'"re. We like the people here and
they patronize us liberally, which
roves that they like us.
"The war has nothing to do with
our decision to become American citi
zens. We decided some years ago
'hat wo would take out our naturaliza
tion papers, because we thought mor"
of the United States than we did of
rny country in the world.
"Having lived in the old country,
e can appreciate the opportunities
offered in America probably more than
4he nafivp born do. People here think
more of each ether than they do
'broad. They aie better friends, and
' here are no friends like the friends in
Cape Girardeau. Just say that th
B'ore brothers are strong for Uncle
Sam."

The horse was shipped under the
-econd rate, the value of the horse be
ing placed at $100.
The racer was injured on the Frisco
between St. Lcuis and Oran, so badly
that he had to bo killed during the
following month. Mr. Stubblefield
sued Ihe Frisco f .r $7000, the value he
placed upon his animal as a racer. He
obtained a judgment in the Circuit
Court for $3500 and an appeal was
taken.

SPECIAL DISPATCH TO THE TRIBUNE
Washington, March 8. Americans, planning to travel on armed mer
chantmen, flying the flag of a belligerent nation, will receive an indirect,
but effective warning from the State Department that the passage is taken
at their own rick. This became officially known through Secretary Lans
ing today.
The warning will bo brought about in either one of two wayj. First
The next arrival in American ports of armed merchantmen will be followed
by an examination z.s to the nature of the armament. If the armament is of
fensive in character, the vessel will be regarded as an auxiliary cruiser in
character, and will be ordered out of
Second The first instance of sinking of an armed merchantman without
arning will be a case for an immediate investigation to ascertain the na
ture of the armament. If offensive, the opinion will bo that the submarine
.eted within it rights, and the case will be dropped without the formality of
an exchange of diplomatic negotiations between this nation and the powers
involved.
The attitude of the United States in reference to the submarine contro
verysy takes the United States out of th danger zone, lender.; in Washing-
on b lieve. It is said on high authority that the attitude of the State De
partment, which has the approval of President Wilson, became known to
membrrs of Congress before the vote was taken on the resolutions intro
duced in the S.'nat and House to warn Americans a-ruist talcing passage on
armed b lligercnt vessel?.
It became known totlay that President Wilson invited the editors of th
lending German-American newspapers to Washington, when he went over
vit'n them the plans of the govcrnmet. This was done i:i order not to em
barrass the President or members of Congress v. hil the negotiations were
under way.
The new policy of Washington is responsible, it is said, for the change
in attitude of Senators Stone and Gore and Speaker Clark and Majority
Leader Kitchin, who made a vigorous tight on the President's announced
plan to force a show down with Germany, and when the time came to
vote, they upheld the chief executive.
When it became known that the President merely wanted Congress to
:-dorse his course for its effect upon foreign nations, the leaders in both
houses promptly voted him their approval. With Congre'ss on record as
indorsing his foreign policy and giving him a free hand in future negotia
tions, the President is now in a position to deal firmly with belligerents, and
to take steps to protect the interests of this nation.

The submarine emestion has been a
thorn in the Wilson administration's
foreign policy. It became known to
night that the President was deter
mined to remain friendly with all the
belligerents and yet extend all of them
every courtesy that they are entitled
o under internoticnal law.
There will be no formal warning is
sued to Americans to refrain from us
ing armed belligerent ships, but the
policy of the United States as an
nounced in the press, coupled with the
attitude of this country toward belli

ports will serve to notify subjects of
this country that they will not enjoy
protection from their government un
less they take proper precautions to
protect themselves.
The government has taken the stant'.
that Americans who board belligerent
ships are either inspired to do so or
permit their friendship for one of the
belligerents to govern their action.
