as far as the army Is concerted.
In an over night dispatch General

he be authoriied to send American
troops over the border to clean out
the bandits' gang. The state depart

tion. The state department made It plain

vides for a punitive expedition to deal

can government wants Villa dead, or
alive, and no steps will be neglected
to carry out that object Not less
ttan B.000 men will be used, all from
General Funstons command. This ac
tion was decided by the cabinet this
morning, which said that Villa must
be eliminated, as was Huerta.
Mexican Ambassador Arredondo
would not comment on the news. He
ssld yesterdsy, however, In his opin
ion Carrania would not resent such
action.
No plans have been made as far as
known for the use of the National
Guard.
It la considered probable the At
lantic fleet might be placed In Mexi
can waters to protect Americans In
the coast towns.
Official Washington generally com
mends the president for his action.

New York. March 10. Colonel
Theodora Roosevelt, who Is at Trin
idad, British West Indies. In a state
ment given out Thursday through the
Evening Mall, emphatically declines
to be a candidate in the primaries of
Massachusetts or of sny other state.
"I will not enter Into any fight for
the nomination," the colonel says.
"Indeed I will go further and ssy
that It would be a mistake to nomi
nate me unless the country haa In
Its mood something of the heroic, un
less It feels not only advocating It
self to Ideals, bt the purpose mess
uresbly to realize those Ideals In
America.
"This Is one of those rare times
which come only at long Intervals In
a nation's history, when the action
taken determines the life of the gen
erations that follow. Such were the
days of Wsshlngton and Lincoln.
"It Is for us todsy to grapple with
the tremendous national and Interna
tional problems of our own hour In
the spirit and with the ability shown
by those who upheld the hands of
Lincoln and Washington.
"Whether we do or do not accom
plish this feat will largely depend up
on the action taken at the Republican
and Progressive conventions. Noth
ing Is to be hoped from the present
administration all that they offer us
Is a choice between degrees of hy
iwrlsy and degrees of Infanmy."
