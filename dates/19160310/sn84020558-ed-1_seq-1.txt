(Republican A. P. Leased Wire)
COLUMBUS, N. M., March 9. Francisco Villa, out
lawed Mexican bandit, raided United States territory to
day. With 1,500 men he attacked Columbus, killed at least
sixteen Americans and fired many buildings before he was
driven back across the international border.
At least 250 troopers of the Thirteenth United States
cavalry followed the Villa band into Mexico. Reports to
Colonel H. J. Slocum late today stated that Villa had made
a stand fifteen miles south of the border, where spirited
fighting ensued. In this engagement an unnamed private
was killed and Captain Adjutant George Williams was
wounded.
The small, detachment, of. troopers, under Majors
Tompkins and Lindsley, fighting dismounted, made a de
termined stand against the renewed Villa attack and at
last reports were holding their ground.
The raid to American territory proved

undetermined' number or dead snii ly

Led to the attack under. the slogan:
fvath to the Americans." Villa's fol
lowers fought with desperation. Just
before (lawn they crept along ditches
skirling the Fnited States cavalry
camp nnd rushed the sleeping town,
firing heavily.
The first volley brought American
troopers into almost instant
a- lion,
While, a portion
,f the raiders engaged
the; cavalry, others detailed by the
bandit chieftain began applying the
torch and shooting American civilians
who ventured from the buildings.
Lights in homes and public buildbigs
then became targets for snipers posted
W at Villa's direction. Other bandits
leepmg close to American homes en-
toed a number of civilians into the
open witli English snokon invitations.
A number r.f fatalities are attributed to
this ruse.
.. , Storp.s were looted, oil was poured
upon frame structures and the match
j applied hv still other bandits. The
posiolfice was raided, furniture
VJfc smashed, but the looters secured ml;,
-i. ,f one small registered package.
t .Many civilians barricaded themselves
in their homes and fired at the .Mexi
cans as they darted through the streets.
The fighting in the town ended al-
most as suddenly as it began. Less
than two .hours after the first shot
was heard Villa's biigl'Ts sounded the
IflrrM and tin- raiders began a disor
dered flight, closely followed by Ameri
can troopers.
