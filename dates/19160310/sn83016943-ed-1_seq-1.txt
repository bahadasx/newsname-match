PIG CLUB WORK
From tfa SuparlntandmV U
Ttach$r$ and Ctnh Mttnbar
Mr. P. H. Banders, the state
agent for Pig Club Work, win be
with me for three days the twenty-first,
twenty-second and twen
ty-third of this month. We ex
pect to visit as many places as
possible during that time and as
sist the teachers in organization
of the pig clubs and to give al
the information necessary to carry
on the clubs already organized
The following dates will be re
h membered:
J Salem Consolidated School, Tues
I day morning, the twenty-first, at
High School, Tuesday afternoon at
one forty-five; Brooksville High
School, Wednesday morning at
: nine o'clock; Lynn Creek Congoll
dated 1 School, Wednesday after
noon at one one forty-five; Macon
High School, Thursday morning
at eight thirty, and Shuqualak
High School, Thursday afternoon
1 at two o'clock. ( ,
. On account of the short time
'which Mr. Banders ha to spend
with ns, it will be impossible to
visit all the schools: and these
have been chosen because we
thought we could reach all the
boys most conveniently at these
places. If you are a club mem.
ber either in corn club, pig club
or tomato club, try to attend one
of these meetings. You can afford
to miss one day from your class
work to get all the instructions
necessary for your , work for the
Summer.
I am sorry to announce to the
tomato club girls that we will be,
unable to get the home economics
agent for the county for this sum
mer. This is not because of any
loss of interest On the part of the
superintendent or your board of
ts-iisors, buU because ot the
failure of state legislature , so far
Ito make the necessary appropria-
JtiOn to meet the requirements of
Jthe Federal government which
iwas to assist in the work. How
ever, the countv agent is not es
pential to the organization of the
omato club. She would have
been a wonderful help to us, and
trill be essential so far as the final
Establishment of the work e
rally is concerned. But I want
very girl who is in a position to
oin, and who is not afraid of a
tew difficulties, to enlist in the
york anyway. There will be in
ttructions sent you from the state
!gent and from this office as you
feed .them, and there will be
frizes worth working for. Those
fhb begin this year will have a
Ireat advantage over those who
lait till next year to begin, be-

Two Cartas Dias:
One of the two curious diseases
that have recently come to the
doctors is commonly known as
. sleepy palsy," but, because it
is so often found in those who
have been too festive on Satur
day night, the hospital name is
Saturday night paralysis." It
comes from pressure on that
nerve (the musculospiral) which
actuates the extensors ef the el
bow, wnst and fingers. The
hard drinker, for whom, on Sat
urday night, money and leisure
inopportunely meet, will often
fall forward on the table with
his head resting on his arm, and
so remain until the effect of drink
are over, waking up to find his
forearm and hand inert and
nerveless, a condition persisting
for days or weeks, even months,
and similar to that seen in lead
palsy. . . .
tt The other disease is known as
'Monday morning paralysis."

Ut$ of Neutral Flag:
As the war progresses thinra
that excited us at the beginning
attract little attention.
It will be recalled how great
was the agitation m Germany
and the United btates when, aft
er Germany declared her subma
nne blockade, one of the great
British liners new the Stars'and
Stripes while fleeing through the
forbidden zone. Not a few
Americans symoathized with Ber
lin's outburst o f indignation
against this use of false colors
and seemed to find in it some
warrant for her claim that she
could not be held responsible if
American ships ventured within
the blockaded waters.
Yet. when the ADDam Doked
her nose into the Virginia capes
the other day. and it was reveal.
ed that she was able to elude the
Bntisn patrols on tne nigh seas
by using some other than , the
German natr. avid that the raid
er which captured her had slipp
ed from her home port showing
the bwedish colors, the fact that
both ships had sailed under false
colors created no excitement and
caused no comment-,
Germany lias reason to feel
dated over, the exploits of the

theme of song and story to stir
the patriotism of her future gen
erations. But, while she not
only has to her credit the amaz
ing achievements of her land
forces, but the even more bril
liant and daring enterprises of
her navy both above and below
the sea, she can hardly be said
to be following a consistent
course toward the issues the war
from time to time raises. N. 0.

JT L e United States Public
Health, service i brands 'stroncr
drink as the most efficient ally of
pneumonia., it declares that al
cohol isthe handmaiden of the
disease which produces ten per
cent of the deaths in the United
btates. This is no exageration,
We have known for a long time
that indulgence in : alcoholic li
quors lowers the individual vital
ity, and that the man who drinks
is peculiarly susceptible to pneu
monia. The united States Pub
lic Health service is a conserva
tive body. It does not engage
in alarmist propaganda. In fol
lowing out the line of its official
duties it has brought forcefully
to the general public a fact which
will bear endless repetition. The
liberal and continuous user of al
coholic drinks will do well to
heed this warninsr. particularly
at this season of the year when
the gruesome death toll from
pneumonia is being doubled.

"To have presented the car to
the Governor and his acceptance

ism, ana it was a graceiui ana

Is this not a distinction without
difference? But such refined
and discriminating consideration
for the Governor's feeling is
worthy of the age. the political

He used the Democratic party to

That Gore was not misjudged
