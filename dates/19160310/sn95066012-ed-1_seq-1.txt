IS CAPTURED
41 VIM FIGHT
Loss of the Village is Vigorously
Denied By Pans
BUT FIERCE FICHTING COES ON
Artillery Onslaughts of Germans Re
pulsed With Heavy
Losses.
London. March 0. Shifting their
main attack back to the east of tbe
Meuse, the German forces before Ver
dun have been delivering violent as
saults on the French front east and
southeast of Douaumont, their chief
objective being Vaux and Fort de
Vaux, which lies a little more than
half a mile to the southward of the
village.
Both Vaux and the fort were cap
tured by two Posen reserve regiments
in a "glorious night attack," Berlin
reports, stating that the victorious
troops were led by General von Guret
Bky-C'ornitz, Comander of the Ninth
Hescrve Division of the infantry, and
that they took "numerous adjoining
fortified positions.
Loss of the village Is flatly denied
by the official bulletins issued in
Paris, which indicate, however, that
the fighting there has been of a very
desperate character. The afternoon
report says that after an intense artii
lery Are the Germans made several
powerful onslaughts, but were com
pletely repulsed, some detachments
who entered Vaux being driven out by
a counterattack. The night report em
phasizes the check to the Germans at
this point. Furious onslaughts, prob
ably made today, were repulsed with
heavy losses, it is said. .
Berlin, March 8, (via London,)
March 9. The attack on the village
of Forges, on the west bank of the
Meuse, which resulted in Its capture
by the Germans, was made necessary
by the fact that the French position
over lapped those of the Germans by
several kilometers to the. north. From
the ridges of the Cote de l'Oie the
French heavy artillery was able '; to
take the Germans from the flank and
rear. ' ; , ;
The statements that German losses
at Verdun were relatively light seem to
find corroboration in an official list of
the casualties of the Twenty-fourth
Regiment of Brandenburgers, who
were in the thick of the fighting from
the beginning and stormed Fort Dou
aumont. The total casualties in the
list are 202, of whom fifty are dead.
Reports circulating in Neurippin, the
home garrfson of tho regiment are
that the total losses in the storming
of the fort were only eighteen killed
and wounded.

Bennington for Me.
All up and down the country,
O'er mountain, hill, and plain,
And Into nearly every part
Ot Uncle Sam's domain,
I've travelled, wandered, lingered
In many a lovely haunt,
But for a place to live in
I'ce chosen old Vermont.
.The old Green Mountain common
wealth Has many a famous town.
But one there is among the rest
Of great and high renown;
Its name is writ in letters large
On History's shining page,
Its glory brightens with the years
An ne'er shall dim with age.
So it's Bennington, old Bennington,
Dear Bennington for me!
And at the foot of her. monument
I'll plant my family tree;
And here I'll live in sweet content,
And never more I'll roam,
For the dearest place on earth to me
Is my Green Mountain home.

TAKES DEFEAT LIKE GOOD SPORT
Head of Anti-Saloon League . Says
. There Will Be No Whining. ,
Burlington, March ' 8VVe got
licked. There are hot enough remains
to hold an autopsy over," was the way
the Rev. C. H. Smith, secretary of
the Anti-Saloon League, answered a
request today for a statement on the
result of the referendum on the Perry
state-wide prohibition bill yesterday
which resulted in a crushing defeat
for the project for which Mr. Smith
and his fellows have been earnestly
working during the past year. "We
put up as good a fight as we knew
how; we played as fair as we could;
undoubtedly we made mistakes; but
there Is no whining."
Mr. Smith immediately ., expressed
the good faith of . the : Anti-Saloon
League regarding the repealing or the
Perry bill when the legislature : of
1917 convenes. The:,Perry .bill was.
passed by the legislature, the question
submitted to the people being whether
it woud take effect May 1, this year,
or In 1927. It was the understanding
in the legislature that if toe.': voters
called for the 1927 date, the next; leg
islature would repeal the bill. .:r ,; .
"Whatever Influence J ..personally
have will be exerted to have introduc
ed on the first day of the session of
the 1917 legislature a bill repealing
the Perry act. There will be no de
lay; It Is thoroughly understood by
the anti-saloon people and there Is
not entertained a single thought con
trary to doing Just what it Is expect
ed we should and ought to do," said
Mr. Smith.
"We accept the vote as the verdict
of the people," continued Mr. Smith
"But the people have not expressed
themselves as being in favor of the
saloon, not that; they have said that
they are in favor of local option. Wf
believe in the majority rule, and we
will do all that we can to keep out
the saloon under the local option law."
Asked how he accounted for the
unexpected result and its proportions
Mr. Smith said: "There evidently
was a failure on the part of a great
number of individuals to understand
Just what the new law proposed. A
great many evidently misunderstood
It. Yet the vote all through the state
shows what the people preferred.
"It is altogether too early to . sav
anything definite about plans for the
future," declared the secretary of the
Anti-Saloon League. Personally 1
feel just as I did when I entered the
work four years ago. I shall not give
it up. I will work to keen out the
saloon under the present law. The
people have not expressed themselvep
In favor of the saloon. There will be
some new lines of work. The first
thing Is to work for the repeal of the
Perry bill iu the next legislature." ,

Would Stir Amerlcaana to Realize
' That Crisis in Nation's History is
at Hand.
Col. Theodore Roosevelt, who is now
at. Trinidad, British West Indies, In a
statement given out yesterday through
the New York Evening Mail, emphati
cally declines to be a candidate in tbe
primaries ot Massachusetts or ot any
other state. The statement is as fol
lows: -
"I am deeply sensible of the honor
conferred on me and of the good will
shown me by tbe gentlemen who have
announced themselves as delegates to
be elected in my interest in the Mas
sachusetts presidential primary. Nev
ertheless, I must request, and I now
do request and Insist, that my name
be not brought into Uie Massachusetts
primaries, and I emphatically decline
to be a candidate in tbe primaries of
that or of any other ttate. Montb.3
ago I formally notified the authori
ties of Nebraska, Minnesota and Mich
igan to this effect.
"I do not wish the nomination. I
am not in the least interested in the
political fortunes eltlier of myself or
any other man. I am Interested in
awakening my ' fellow-countrymen to
the need of facing unpleasant facts.
1 am Interested in triumph of the
great principles for which with all my
heart and soul I have striven and
thall continue to strive.
"I will not enter into auy fight for
tbe nomination and I will not permit
any factional fight to be made in my
behalf. . Indeed, I will go further and
say that It 'would be a mistake to
nominate me unless the country has
in Its mood something of the heroic
unless It feels not only devotion to
ideals but the purpose measurably tc
realize those ideals In action.
"This If.Gtie of those rare times
which come only t-long intervals iu
a nation's history where the action
taken determines the basis of the life
of the generations: that follow.' Such
times were those from 17? to '1789,
in ihoi days of Washington, 'and fnoiri
1858 tb 1805, in the days of Lincoln:
VJt is for -us of today to 'grapple
with the .tremendous national and in
ternational problems 'of onr own hour
In the spirit and with tbe ability
shown by those who upheld the hands
of Washington and LincoJn.-Wheth-er
we do or do not accomplish this'
feat will largely depend on the' action
taken nt the republican aud progres
sive national convention next June.
"Nothing is to be hoped from the
present administration, and the strug
gles between the president aud his
party leaders in Congress are today
merely struggles as to whether the
nation shall see its governmental rep
resentatives adopt an attitude ot a
little more or a little less hypocrisy
and follow a policy of slightly greater
or slightly less baseness. All that they
offer us Is a choice between degrees
of hypocrisy and degrees of Infamy.
"June is a long way off. Man
things may occur between, now i and.
then.- It is utterly impossible to say
now with any degree of ii certainty
who should be nominated' at Chicago;
The crying, the vital need now lsthht
the men who next June assemble ' at
Chicago from the 48 Btates and min
gle the view of the entire countrj,
ahall act with the sane and lofty de
votion to the interest of ours nation
as a whole which was Bhownby tho
original Continental Congress; ' They:
should approach their task unham
pered by any pledge except to-bring
to its accomplishment every ounce o'
courage, intelligence and integrity
they possess. ...

Americans Troops on Mexican Soil
After Haiders
18 MEXICANS WERE KILLED
Villa w.- Burned Part of Town of
Columbus and "Murdered Dozen"
Americana.
Francisco Villa, outlawed Mexican
bandit raided United States territory
at Columbus N. M., yesterday. 1 With
500 men be attacked Columbus, killed
at least 16 Americans and fired many
buildings before he was driven back
across tbe international border.
At least 250 troopers of the 13th
United States cavalry followed the
Villa band Into Mexico. Reports to
CoL H. J. Slocum, commanding United
States troops at Columbus, lute yes
terday stated that Villa had made a
stand 15 miles south of the border
where spirited fighting ensued. In
this engagement an unnamed private
was killed and Capt. George Williams,
adjutant of the ldth cavalry was
wounded.
Tho small detachment of troopers
under Maj.. Frank Tompkins and El
mer Llndsley, fighting dismounted
made a determined Btand against the
renewed Villa attack and at last re
ports were holding their ground.
The raid on American territory prov
ed costly to the bandit chieftian. The
bodies of 18 bandits, including Pablo
Lopez, second in command, had boon
gathered and burned at noon ami
troopers reported an undetermined
number of dead still lying in the
brush.
Led to the attack under the slogan,
"Death to the Americans!" Villas fol
lowers fought with desperation. Just
before dawn they crept along ditches
skirting tho United States cavalry
camp and rushed the sleeping town,
firing heavjivv
The first volley brought American
troopers, into fajmcst, instant action,

upon frame structures, and the match

post office was raided and furniture
smashed, but the looters secured only
one small registered package.
El Paso, Tex., March 9. Failure of
the machine guns to work at the mo
ment when they were most needed at
the beginning of the fight between the
Villa bandits and tho Thirteenth cav
alry, at Columbus early this morning,
was the cause for the escape of the
bandits across the border and also for
the relatively small loss of life among
the;MexiCanB,:hccordlng to "Private
Thomas Barton xt tlt: hospital corps,
who, with Private' E. ' M.' Johhson;
brought five wounded soldiers nnd;onel
officer to El Paso till afternoon. ; .
According to the soldleTS, the attack
egan near the-edge of : 'Columbus;
There were no gimB or weapons of any
kind In the hospital. ''Johnson said he
killed one Villa bandit with an axe
which he threw as tho fleeing Mexican
passed the hospital Shouting! "Viva
Villa!:. ':' - 'v--- -. .'i
Prlrate Venner,' : who was shot
throngh the chest Said he killed foilr
Mexicans and was raising his rifle to
fire at another, when a bullet struck
him. He says the Villa men had no
machine guns.
Many civilians barricaded them
selves in their homes and fired at the
Mexicans as they darted through the
streets. . The fighting in the town end
ed almost as suddenly as it begun.
Less than two hours after the first
shot was heard, Villa's buglers sound
ed the retreat and the raiders began a
disordered flight, closely followed by
American troopers.
The casualties of the 13th cavalry
In the fighting' at Columbus were
seven killed and bIx wounded. Villa's
total losseB In the day's fighting were
estimated in excess of :100 killed and
