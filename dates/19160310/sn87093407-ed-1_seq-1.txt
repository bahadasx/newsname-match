Mayor Oi II wrote a letter
Thursday to 0. O. Conger of
th« Anti-Saloon league propos
ing that an "active, vigorous
young lawyer of unimpeachable
Integrity" be selected to prose
cute violators of ths prohibition
law.
The city council, he saya,

that the mayor and Prosecutor
Lundln Indorse It.
Me wsnts the league to name
the lawyer.
Prosecutor Lundln said Friday
that his staff, If It had the co
operation of the police depart
rii»nt, could handle the situation ef
ficiently.
Says Police Are Trying
In his letter to Conger th" mayor
explains that the special prosecutor
should "try the cases the same day
with the same evidence, and follow
each appeal Immediately."
"Slnrp January 1." says the letter,
"the police department and myself
have been making every "ffort to
rigidly enforce the dry law und«»r
the city ordinance. We have ob
tained many convictions, collected
a very large sum of money from
fines, and generally, I think, have
l»<-n mu<"h more successful than I
hsd hoped for.
Foresaw Difficulties
"Of wurse we all foresaw th"
difficulties which were Inevitable.
So fur as that feature of the law Is
concerned which allows unlimited
ral"n by drug stores on prescrip
tions."
He says that most drug stores are
respecting the law, hut that a cer
tain clans of them evade It.
He proposes that prescriptions he
checked for a time, and the data
*ath'*red and taken before the state
medical board.
The mayor said that th« strong
est, feature of the prohibition law,
ir his opinion, is the provision al
lowing a fine of 11,000 for a second
conviction.
He said that "with the second
conviction it ought not. to be hard
in the superior court to g«"t a lon*
time jail sentence."

Resuming Attack
EL PASO, March 10.—(Bulletin.)— J. B. Blair,
prominent Columbus, N. M., merchant, telephoned
this afternoon that Gen. Villa, with 2,000 men, was
reported moving to attack Columbus again. Blair said
the town is excited. Residents are hiding in their adobe
houses.
The Thirteenth cavalry has been ordered out to

They will go with the single purpose of capturing Gen.

I his was announced this afternoon by President Wilson,
in the following statement:
"An adequate force will be sent into Mexico at once in
pursuit of Villa, with the single object of capturing him and
putting a stop to his forays. This can and will be done entire

with scrupulous rcsjx-ct for that republic's sovereignty."
Carranza Agrees to U. S. Co-operation
The president's declaration indicated Provisional Presi
dent Carranza ha<l informed this government he was willing
to have Americans co-operate with him in ending Villas ,J
banditry.
While it was not announced, it is probable that Presi
dent Wilson will send a message to congress within a few
days, outlining his reasons fur today's orders.

Congress today passed a resolution of approval of the j
president's action. The American expedition will consist
chiefly of infantry, with at least 2.000 cavalry, a detachment
.of field artillery and several batteries of mountain guns on
pack mules. The mountain guns are especially adapted to
the guerilla fighting which is expected.
Flying Column Will Lead
A flying column ' of 2,000 men, mostly cavalry, will
constitute the advance force which is to do the active work
of searching out Villa and making tentative plans for the
campaign. 1 lie Americans probably will be concentrated at

"get Villa, dead or alive."
Tension in the house and senate increased.
Senator Stone was angry. He referred to the Villista
invaders as "murdering whelps" and intimated he might
lead an organized demand for aggressive action.
"'Senator McCumber introduced a resolution demanding
that something be done.
It declared that for two years murders of Americans and
acts of brutality had been weekly occurrences, that the gov
ernment had exhausted every effort to keep from interven

The resolution said the \merican attitude only embold
