less than 5,000 men, fell of which are available on the
border, under Major-General Funston. In its present
stage the president's order does not mean aimed inter

WHITE HOUSE STATEMENT.
The following statement was issued at the white
house:
"An adequate force will be sent at once in pursuit
of Villa with the single object of capturing him and
putting a stop to his forays. This can be done and will
be done in entirely friendly aid of the constituted au

sovereignty of that republic."
NOT AN INVASION.
It is declared that the United States will not con
sider the punitive expedition an invasion of Mexico,
and will continue to deal with the Carranza govern

armed intervention in Mexico, but has decided that the
peace of both Mexido and the United States is imperiled
by the continued activities .of' Villa. The cabniet is
unanimous in decidingjthat Villa must be caught.

At the state department it was

Devils Lake, N. D., March 10.—
Here's the 'inside' story of the break
between John'Bloom.'publisher of the
Devils Lake Journal,', and -Joe Kelly,
president -of the Farmers Railroad
company, which hps been the'most re
cent 'seven day wonder' in North Da
kota politics. i-
The big break was brought about
because Hal S. Davies, editor of the
Devils Lake Journal, .formerly a Twin
City newspaper mart, appointed to the
postmastership and. whose name ier
now hung tip In a senatorial sub-com
mittee, ish't a democrat. Kelly and
his friends insist that Davies is a re
publican—that he registered during
the last two elections as a republican,
arid is not, under such circumstance,
entitled to the ^support of the* demo
crats for the post.
Agreement Alleged.
Back of Mr. Davies' appointment,
which was Itself somewhat of a poli
tical sensation,' fend which marked the
final passage of John Bloom's hope of
being postmaster, Is said to exist an
agreement—a gentlemen's agreement
—that the Ramsey County Demo
cratic Central Committee would have
nothing to My as: long as there was
any chance fojr "Bloom to'land the of
fice.
Once, however, It was apparent that
Bloom eould not be confirmed and
senatorial courtesy was not likely to
be overridden In this case, in .view of
the fact that Senator A. J. Gronna ot
North Dakota told his colleagues in
the senate' that he would consider the
confirmation of Bloom a personal af
front, then It la said to have been un
derstood that, the democratic commit
tee of the county should be called in
and be permitted to makeitself heard.
But,, to all Intents and purposes, this
wasn't done, pioom .evidently was
advised "that' the "Jig was -up," so far

Break Between Bloom and Kelly
Over Devils Lake Post Office
Brings Many Issues Into Ring
t- it.
II
Washington, March 10.—General
Scott said that 'he necessity of pro
viding an even stronger force for the
border than it now nis. while Ameri
can troops are operating in Mexico,
would necessitate using some troops
not now there for the expedition into
Mexico. They will probably be or
dered fr»m other posts. No plans
htsve bee.i made fo far as is known
for the us« of tne National Guard.
Blesio Arredonedo, Carranza's am
bassador here renved the news «f
the presidents c'eiicjon with tha
btatement that lie could make no com
ment but would immediately notify
Carranza.
Yesterday he dcriated it to be his
own opinion that .such action would
not be resented.
•as-he was concerned, and a few days
later the name of Davies went to the
senate. for the postmastership. But
it didn't bear the approval of the
Ramsey. County Democratic commit
tee, as is supposed to have been
agreed upon.
When" Kelly and other democrats
were apprised of the situation, they
called the county committee together,
and the endorsement of W. H. Belford
for the post was the result.
........ Equity Involved.
As-a comeback, the Blbomsupport
ers have injected a new issue—that of
anti-Equity opposition to Davies, as a
measure of punishment because the
Devils Lake Journal has been more or
less active in the support of the
Equity, movement. This issue, it is
contended by some who are Interested
in the affair, has been raised in an ef
fort to force John Burke, former gov
ernor, to. take up the Davies' cause,
and bring-about his confirmation.
As a comeback, however, is the fact
that Kelly, during all the years that
the Devils Lake Journal has been
supporting the Equity movement hail
been a. heavy stockholder In the pa^
per, and-one of Its heaviest creditors.
Kelly,- in connection with the
Equity issue, -has been -charged with
being the sponsor of the attempt to
punish -Bloom, for his support of the
Equity proposition.
Break Is Serious.
The break between Bloom and Kei
ly is fraught with big possibilities, so
far as the future of democracy in
Ramsey, county and the Lake Region
is concerned.
It la another element, that John
Burke must- contend with If he be

States senatorshlp, and complicates

Washington," March 10.—-While the
president and cabinet were deciding
to send troops .over the border, agi
tation had broken out afresh in con
gress. Senator McCumber and Sena
tor Fall, republicans, introduced reso
lutions proposing armed action in
different ways.
Both resolutions were referred to
the foreign relations committee, while
Chairman Stone counseled his col
leagues to let the executive depart
ment of the government handle the
situation.
While the senate was talking and
some desultory speeches were being
made in the house, the president
acted and the leaders, notified quickly
by telephone from the White House,
passed the word around.
It spread quickly but both house
and senate received it as coolly as an
announcement of the passage of a
routine bill. Democrats generally ex
pressed the opinion that the presi
dent's action was wholly Justified, and
the republicans who had been urging:
action expressed gratification that it
had been taken.
There were no signs of dissension.

the Ice being about seven inches
thicker than the average condition.
The field began to form In January

Paris Denies Claims of Suc

Teutons.
Paris, March 10.—There is no
change in the situation before Ver
dun either west or east of the Meuse,
according to a semi-official announce
ment.
The announcement adds that a vio
lent bombardment continued on both
banks of the Meuse river, but that
there has' been no Infantry attack by
the Germans.
Deny Capture.
An official note has been issued
categorically denying the statement
made in a German official communi
cation yesterday, that "the village and
armored fort of Vaux were captured
in a glorious night attack by Posen
reserve regiments under the leader
ship of General Guretsky Corintz."
This assertion, the note sayB, is in
every way false. The note denies
other statements contained in the re
cent German official communications.
Two Ships Torpedoed.
A Havas dispatch from Havre says
that the French line steamship Louis
iane sank last night at 11 o'clock. All
the crew was saved. No passengers
were aboard. It is presumed that
the vessel was sunk by the same sub
marine that has been operating along
the coast between Boulogne and
Havre and which torpedoed the Her
matrice.
The Louisiane had arrived from
New Orleans, which port she left on
February 11, entering Newport News
February 17, leaving on the follow
ing clay for France. She was 5,109
tons gross, and 378 feet long. She
was for many years engaged in trans
Atlantic passenger service, mostly to
ports in the Gulf of Mexico.
The allusion in the above dispatch
to submarine operating along the
English channel between Boulogne
and Havre, is first word that has- been
received here regarding the presence
of hostile craft on that part of tlie
French coast. Available shipping rec
ords make no mention of the vessel
named Hei-matrice.
Sunk by Mines.
London, March 10.—The British
torpedo boat destroyer, Coquette, and
the torpedo boat No. 11 have been
sunk by striking mines, it Is officially
announced.
The announcement says the number
of casualties in connection with the
sinking of these war ships is 45 men
lost.
NO OFFICIAL ADVICES.
London, March 10.—The foreign of
fice has received no official advices
that Turkey is seeking peace. How
ever. the impression prevails, from
what is known of conditions in Tur
key. that there is a strong probability
•of an early move in that direction.
BOAT STRIKES MINE.
London, March 10.—A Reuter dis- 4
patch from Malmoe says the Swedish -s,
steamship Martha struck two mines
within Swedish waters oft FalsterbO..
The crew was saved.
Several steamships named Martha
