PARIS, March 10.—The-situation
on both banks of the Meuse as the
result of last night's fighting around
Verdun is unchanged, the war office
stated this afternoon.
Dispatches from the Verdun front
today repeated the statement that the
Germans who entered the village of
Vaux, were driven out and denied the
XSerman claim that Fort De Vaux and
adjoining positions were captured.
Violent artillery actions continued
on both banks of the Meuse through
out the night, but there were no Im
portant infantry engagements, it was
stated.
"In the Woevre region, Intermlt
ent artillery firing continued last
night," said the official statement.
"In Alsace, east of Thanna, our bat
teries on Hill 425 wrecked enemy
trenches. In the Argonne we can
nonaded enemy convoys on the Mont
faucon-Avacourt road.
"The German claim, circulated by
wireless that German troops captur
ed Fort de Vaux and the village of
Vaux, constitute an insult to the In
telligence of neutrals,'' said this aft
ernoon's official statement. "The
same may be said of the report
spread by Germans In Spain and
Roumanla that the French started
the Verdun offensive."
The official statement quoted from
a telegram, the kaiser Is said to have
sent to the provincial chamber at
Hanover, declaring "the fatherland Is
forced to defend Its honor and liber
ty against our enemies' scheme* of
annihilation."
This declaration, the war office
stated, was proof that the Germans al

Verdun.

a Fokker, were destroyed and thir

WASHINGTON, March 10.
—American troops are going
into Mexico after Villa.
President Wilson made this
official announcement at the
white house at 1:02 this after
jnoon. The announcement fol
lowed a meeting- of the cabinet
which decided to authorize the
sending of a punitive expedi
tion across the border. At
least 8,000 troops will form the
original force tihat will march
into Mexico, it was stated at
the war department.
The white house statement follows:
"An adequate force will be sent at
once in pursuit of Villa with the sin
gle object of capturing him and put
ting a stop to hlB forces.
"This can and will be done In en
tirely friendly aid of the constituted
authorities of Mexico and with scru
pulous respect for the sovereignty of
that republic."
The statement issued by the presi
dent indicates that General Carranza
has informed this government that he
is entirely willing to have the United
States act with h'm in putting an end
to the Villa banditry.
•Secretary Baker refused any state
ment as to the war department's plan
on the action of the cabinet, but Indi
cated that later he would likely have
some statement.
The American force will consist
chiefly of infantry. There will be,
however, at least a thousand to two
thousand cavalry. There will also be
included at least a detchment of field
artillery and several batteries of
mountain guns, loaded on pack mules
and especially adapted for guerilla
fighting anticipated In the hilly sec
tion where Villa is expected to make
his stand.
A flying column of about 2,000 men,
according to tentative plans of high
army officials, will constitute the prob-*
ing force to which will be delegated
the most active work of searching out
Villa.
This force probably will concentrate
at or near Colun.bus within twenty
four hours. From points west and
east of Columbus the remainder of:

mans, it Is believed here. German In
fantry captured only advanced French
positions which had been blown to
pieces by lavish waste of shells. The
Germans were checked and mowed
down when they rolled up against the
bulwarks to which the French had re
tired. The second phase of the strug
gle was necessarily one of prepara
tion. The crown prince re-arranged
his artillery. There are evidences
that he arranged his plans too, the
first progarm for the taking of Ver
dun being cast aside on account of the
heavy German losses resulting from
early frontal attacks.
The third phase is developing with
heavy attacks on tooth wings and bat
tering assaults in the center. These
are seemingly preliminary to a grand
assault, when the crown prince will
stake all in a fierce rush upon the Ver
dun fortress from three Bides. From
the French viewpoint, even the cap
ture of the citidel itself would be but
a hollow victory for the Germans. For

A report was received from the Gib

from fifty to 200 were heading for

stricken.

along the border have deserted their

There was great uneasiness In Co

to repel any renewal assault, but day

Mrs. Wright also retold of the dis
appearance of her husband and Frank:
Hayden, an American youth, both of
whom are believed to have been kill
ed by the Villistas.
Mrs. Wright was separated from her
baby, who she believes was given to
a Mexican family.
The Villistas' alleged determination
to make a torch of every American
they encountered, quailed before the
bravery of Mrs. S. T. B\ Ryan, wills
of the captain of E troop.
Attempting to make her escape dup
ing the height of the Columbus fight
ing, a Mexican grasped her arm and
demanded where she was going. Mrs.
Ryan replied calmly, that she was
going for her auto. The Mexican re
leased her. Mrs. Ryan crouched In
the auto throughout the remainder of
the battle and escarped unhurt. The
action of Mtrs. A. L. Klggs, wife a
customs officer, in stifling her Infant's
cries as the Mexicans were shooting
outside her home, was another of the
numerous Instances of heroism on the
part of the American women of Co
lumbus. The Riggs house wae rid
dled with Mexican bullets but she and
her two baJjes escaped Injury.
The coolness with which the Mex
icans sought out their victims and
stood around the bodies of the dead
Americans in the height of the battla
was still commented on today. Cav
alry officers estimated there wers »ver
"1,000 VlTlletas in the attacking party.
Against this force Colonel Slocum
had about 250 troopers with two ma
chine guns. It was rumored, but not
officially confirmed, that one of the
American machine guns failed to work:
properly In the midst of the fighting.
The reason more Americans were
not killed. It was agreed today, was
due to the Villista's looting. S. H.
Eurchafield. whom a squad of Mexi
cans robbed, escaped while they were
arguing over the division of the spoils.
The Mexicans abandoned a part of
their loot on their retreat, closely
pressed by the American troops.
