BATTLE'S FURY
REDOUBLES ON
VERDUNFRONT
French and.Germans Declared
Locked in Greatest Slaugh
ter of the World War.
BOTH REPORT VICTORIES
Berlin Statement Says Fort of

Drive of Teutons.
ALL AGREE CRISIS IS NEAR
Eastern Bank of the Meuse Declared
Veritable Retort of Death-Bayo
nets Used in Charges.
MedCable to The Washisgten Heral.
London, March 9.-The tide of bat
tlIe before Verdun has swept back to
the eastern bank of the Meuse. where
French and Germans are at grips In
the greatest slaughter of the war.
From this retort of death tonight
rval claims of victory are received.
Both French and Germans report
fresh glories for their arms.
The Berlin official statement say.;
that in a furious night assault over
the shell-swept terrain, two Posen re
serve regiments under Gen. Villet
tGuertsky Cornitz carried the armored
fort of Vaux. the village of the same
name and numerous adjoining posi
tions, all of which were strongly fort
etied.
Tvo French communiques, reporting
n same fighting. flatly contradict
this German claim.
ermane Declared Dri"em out.
The afternoon statement, which
imakes no mention of the battle for
Fort \aux, asserts that German
troops who penetrated the village
w ere driven out immediately at the
point of the bayonet.
The midnight statement, issued
hours later than the German report,
says:
"East of the Meuse the Germans
made numerous attacks on our front
from Douaumoat to Vaux. At the
exit from the Ytflaga of Douaumont
their attack was broken by our infan
try and artillery fire. Furious as
saults against the village of Vaux
were likewise repulsed with heavy
losses to the enemy.
"Finally, the Germans launched
against our trenches along the foot of
the ridge, which is surmounted by
Fort Vaux, violent attacks in solid
formation which were repulsed with
enormous losses to the enemy, in
flicted by our barrier fire.
Agree' Crisis Is at Hand.
It is pointed out that the French state
ients have been twelve hours behind the
Ierlin reports in following the develop
tnents of the Verdun fighting. Both
French and Germans agree that the crisis
. at hand In the great battle of Verdun.
the most tremendous of the world war.
The struggle, which is entering its
nineteenth day, is steadily Increasing in
rurv 2ntil, within the next forty-eight
hoers., it is expected to reach a climax
on which the fate of nations hangs.
More than 20000 men have been
fattered in the eighteen days of battle.
The German losses are estimated at 123.00
Mat Moraht, the German critic. places
the French casualties at 75.000 to $0.000.
The battle Is being waged back and
forth on a front of about ten miles.
Intersected by the River Meuse. While
the eyes of the world for the moment
are turned on the struggle epat of the
stream, fighting of tremendous 'iolence
is progressing on the other side.
The French midnight statement says:
"West of the Meuse. our troops con
tinued to progress during the day in the
i'orbeaux Woods, nearly the whole of
which we now hold."
The Berlin war ofice reports:
"West of the Meuse we were occupied
in clearing out the rest of the French
troops in the woods of Corbeaux."
Stateseuta Ceugiet.
The French statement is surprising in
view of the previous night's communique
which said at that time the Germans
oocupied only the eastern extremity of
the forest. No fresh German attacks
had been reported.
On this bank of the river the German
shell fire has literally swept the country
clear of forests.
The German advance to Fort Vaux and
beyond would be a gain or more than two
miles into the French lines and 'would
put the Kaiser's soldIers within four miles
of Verdun itself.

London, March 9.-Addressing Pas.

Meanwhile, the Turks are
gradually removing the mines

LOVE LETTERS

Toler, Wealthy Widow,
Makes Novel Defense.
AVERS PATRICK J. CAREY
DICTATED AMOROUS NOTES

Sent Him Epistles, She Says in
Baring Alleged Plot.
Bretsal to The Wshinetom Herald.
New York, March 9.-Mrs. John Watts
de Peyster Toler. wealthy widow, of an
old and distinguished family, today de
clared before Supreme Court Justice
Philbin that it was fear, not affection.
which prompted her to write scores of
"love letters" to Patrick J. Carey. former
apartment house superintendent.
"Every one of the letters," she said,
referring to the exhibits in which she
had called Carey 'Patsy dear.' were writ
ten by me under sentence of death."
Even the judge was startled by this
extraordinary defense.
"You mean to say that you did not
write those terms of endearment to Carey
volantaritly?" she wa asked.
"I mean to sy, and do say," replied
Mrs. Toler. "that Patrick Carey, now
missing. is the author of every word in
the letters I wrote to him. I was in
Rhinebeck and he was in New York. He
sent me letters he wanted me to copy,
word for word. They are those letters
which Mrs. Carey has shown to the jury.
He wrote them and had me copy them
and send them to him to trap me in this
suit. He said he would take the first
train, If I refused to do as he said, and
I didn't dare to expose him, because I
I didnt dare to expose him, because I
didn't want to mix up my family with
those (nodding toward Mrs. Carey and
her sisters-in-law) blackmailing people."
Mrs. Toler. wearing a new spring suit
of tan, and brown hat and veil, talked
slowly and tensely. Again and again she
repeated that she had apparently made
love to Carey in her letters because "she
was under sentence of death."
Sherman Desires
Armed Intervention
Senator Declares Mexicans
Will Repeat Outrages if
U. S. Is Indecisive.
Special to The Wahinate Herald.
Princeton. Itt., March 2.-Armed inter
vention in Mexico is the answer of Sen
ator Laurence V. Sherman to the latest I
autrage of the Villa soldiers.
"I am in favor of armed intervention," I
laid the Senator when told or the in- I
vasion of Columbus, N. M. We should I
send an armed force to the border not
wnly to protect American soldiers, but t
to go across and make the Mexicans
,espect us.
"We may expect occurrences of this d
clnd while we continue our Indecisive il
;olcy. The Mexicans hold us in con
:empt. They don't fear us and will con- b
dnue not to fear us until we get some s
sackbone. They have Insulted us and d
aughed at us until we may expect any
hing to happen."'
Senator Sherman, who is on record t
mgainst President Wilson in the sub-d
narine issue, used the Mexican de'iop
nent to bolster up his stand.
'What may we expect if the submsarine f
arnue involves us in war with foreign e
yowers when we are unable to protectd
his country from Mexico?" asked then
Senator. "'It 1.s not hard to see what
would happen in Our present state ofa
'npreparedness."t
