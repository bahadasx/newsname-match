with heavy iron rings, and was load

A Sure Investment.
You have never yet made an investment
Where you didn't expect to win,
But you sometime have found to'your sorrbw '
You've beautifully taken in. --
You may have laid down your good money
you found wasn't gold, 45
Or met the Bohemian oats swindler,
When you, wich your oats, havebeen sold.
If asked by a friend to play poker,
You'd experience, no doubt quite a shock;
Then never join hands with a fellow
Who makes money by watering stock.
Now if you would like an investment
In which you can't possibly lose, -
Supose a few dollars in one of Ed. M. Egg 'Pine
