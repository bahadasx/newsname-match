Celebrate Anniversary
With Merry Banquet
Take it from us there was some
celebration at the Labor Temple last
night, when the Stage and Theatrical
Employes got together for their an
nual banquet, the occasion being the
sixth anniversary of the founding of
their union. The stage workers work
until eleven o'clock, so it was the
witching hour of midnight when the
clans gathered. About sixty of the
members and their invited guests,
which included members of the theat
rical profession, sat down to the ban
quet table which was literally loaded
down with the "eats." The committee
bad provided generously, so generous
ly In fact that the Snohomish County
Orphanage was the recipient next j
morning of a choice assortment of
fruits and other goodies.
The following committees had
charge of the banquet and social ses
sion which followed: Entertainment —
Goldthrop, Rice, Fauber. Program—
Petterson, Bebeau, Tucker. Eats —
Webster, Oleson, Tonsland. The print
ed menus were artistic and contained"
the seal of the local in relief on the
outside cover.
The dinner menu deserves, re-pro
duction for its ingenuity in connecting
every member of the local with some
arlicle of food or drink, and using
every term known to the stage craft.

Employers Attack Initiative Bills In The
Courts Final Hearing On Prayer For
Injunction Set For March 14th.
The work of circulating petitions
upon two of the proposed initiative
bills will be somewhat delayed owing
to legal obstacles placed in their way
by large interests who have invoked
the aid of the courts. Petitions upon
the four bills decided upon by the
Joint Legislative Committee were
printed and ready for circulation when
last Friday the employing interests
referred to applied to Judge Wright
of Thurston county for a restraining
order against the printing, circula
tion, or certification by state offi
cials. Hearing upon the application
for a temporary order was had in
Olympia last Monday morning, C. S.
Oleason appearing as attorney for the
employers and C. J. France of Seattle
representing the Joint Legislative
Committee. Assistant Attorney Gen
eral Allen resisted the order on be
half of the state. After hearing argu
ment most of the day the judge took
the case under advisement and Tues
day, March 14th, was set as the date
for final hearing.
The two bills attacked are the ones
familiarly known as the "First Aid"
bill and the "Fish Code." Objection
was raised that both hills contained
sections which were in effect argu
ments for the bills. It fas contended
that the machinery of the initiative
and referendum provided that argu
ments for the bills. It was contended

COPPER STRIKE NOT SETTLED
WASHINGTON.—Secretary French
of the Arizona state federation of la
bor, writes A. F. of L. Secretary Mor
rison that the strike of Arizona cop
per employes is not settled, despite
contrary press reports. Secretary
French states that these workers are
standing firm in their effort to se
cure living conditions, and urges that
wide publicity of this cause be giv
en, together with the need for finan
cial aid.
This strike is unusual because of
the position taken by Gov. Hunt and
county officials, who have announced
thedr opposition to strikebreakers and
gunmen. As a result the strike has
been marked by an entire absence
of violence and the corporations have
initiated recall proceedings against
the governor.

thors or sponsors; that those initiat
ing said measures inserted arguments
for the bills in contravention of exist
ing machinery provided for in other
statutes.
In the case of the "first aid" hill it
was further contended that the bal
lot title furnished by the attorney gen
eral did not properly cover the essen
tials of the bill in that it made no
mention of penalties provided in the
bill.
Following is the section complained
of in Sec. 1 of the fish bill:
"Protection and Conservation of the

olized hy the few to the detriment and
discomfort of the mam, and, inas

the state of Washington are the prop
erty of said state, it is hereby declar
ed that the purposes of this act are
to foster propagation, pint eel ion and
development of this source of food
supply and to create a revenue there
from."
The section in the "first, aid" hill
which it is claimed constitutes an ar
gument and thus renders the bill in
valid, is as follows:
"It is the policy of this state that
industry shall bear the greater pro
portion of the burden of the costs of

EDUCATION VALUE
OF ORGANIZED LABOR
The Citizen believes that the pur
pose oC organized labor is not con
fined merely to securing larger wages
and shorter hours, imp ant as this
is.
The ultimate purpoi- ' is the solidi
fying of the human family and its es
tablishment in a world home worth
while.
This can only be accomplished
through education.
Those who teach the law of force -
that is the kind of force* that ar
rays man against man and class
against class —Is in no sense in ac
cord with the spirit of organized la
bor.
The labor union, the concrete ex
pression of organic 1 labor, is in the
best sense a school
It teaches men thai they are broth
ers and helps unit, hem in brother
hood.
It teaches them si f-respect and as
piration.
It teaches them that the best peace
policy is in organ i 1 society, not in
unorganized mobber;
It teaches them that they have ob
ligations to the community.
It teaches them to uphold, not only
a high standard of ving. hut a high
standard of labor a well.
It teaches them to work team-like
on the job. This i a feature not i
sufficiently appre, ted by employ
ers Men who asso< ate and are con
genial can do much better work to
gether on a job.
It teaches efficiency. The man
who is admitted into a labor union
must prove himself competent in his!
trade, and the standard of competency
is one designed to protect the com
petent worker.
One has only to glance over the
various splendid International trade
magazines and note the character of
their contents to become convinced
that efficiency is a matter held of
high import hy organised labor.

IS THERE ACADEMIC FREEDOM?
WASHINGTON,, — Are professors
allowed to speak their minds freely,
or are they merely "hired men," to
be engaged at the pleasure of the
university trustees? These and oth
|er questions affecting free speech in
American institutions of higher learn
ing are discussed by Dr. S. P. Capen,
of the federal bureau of education, in
j his review of the year made to the
I secretary of the interior. Dr. Capen
' states that upon the settlement of
this question depends the whole wel
fare of American education.
"That there is always some pres-
I sure exerted in academic communi
ties, as elsewhere, to keep radical
| propagandist! quiet and to discourage
destructive criticism of the existing
j order none will deny," he says. "Its
; extent varies with the institution. As
j a rule, it is exerted subtly, often un
| consciously, in large universities
! wbicb are supposedly free."
It is stated that "instances are not
I unknown where the governing boards
of state institutions have behaved as
!if the institutions under their control
j belonged to them, and neither the
■ educational officers nor the public
J had a right to demand reasons for
1 their acts."
