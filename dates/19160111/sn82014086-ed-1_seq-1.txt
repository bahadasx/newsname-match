the French Advanced Trenches The Germans Have
Thus Far Lost Six Aeroplanes in Skirmishes on the Sa
loniki Front In the Balkans Reports Persist That the
. Teutons Are Concentrating at Monastir Preparatory to
an Attack on Saloniki.
London," Jan. 10 .10.28 p. m. While
the Russian front has been quiet dur
ing the past .-twenty -four hours, there
has been severe fighting in the other
war theatres. .
J Austrian. Advance in Montenegro.
On the Montenegrin front the Aus
trians have been , generally success
ful. They have advanced their posi
tions at several important points
despite the handicap of snow waist
deep and are showing themselves just
as adept as the Montenegrins in
mountain fighting, which heretofore
has been regarded as the particular
specialty - of the Montenegro soldiers.
In Champagne the French have re
. pulsed four German attacks. The
Germans, however, have retained a
tfthold at two places in the French
exanced ' trenches.
Turkish Forces Compelled to Retire.
; In Persia British reinforcements on
their way to the relief of Kut-el-Ama-r&
lave met Turkish-forces which
Were compelled to retire after some
heavy fighting.
. PaHta in Bessarabian- Battles.
The Petrbgrad official communica
tion says that the calm on the Czer
nowit front ..is duerto-the hu-kwif.
.. ea, and resulting . demoralization of
the Austro-Hungarian army. That
there is some basis for this statement
Is evident from the estimate of the
Hungarian newspaper Uester Lloyd
that the losses on both sides of the
Bessarabian battles so far exceed 175.
000 or more than the total British
losses in the whole Dardanelles cam
paign. Another Hungarian newspaper
states on the authority of a staff rep
resentative that the fighting on this
front has been the bitterest and
bloodiest in the history of the war,
both sides sacrificing men in a man
ner without parallel.
".' Aeroplane Skidmishes at Saloniki. .
" The . Saloniki front is chiefly no
table in the day's despatches as the
scene of almost continued aeroplane :
skirmishes, one of which continued
for two hours. The Germans have
thus far lost six. aeroplanes in this
region.
The rumor that the consuls of the
Teutonic allies arrested at Saloniki
had 'been released appears to have
been without foundation as it is now
announced that they have been trans
ferred to a French auxiliary cruiser
On - which they have been interned.
Extensive - Turkish reprisals are al
ready , announced and some similar
action is likely from the capitals of
the central powers. -
Situation in Albania.
f The present situation in' ' Albania
was thus summed up today by Lord
Robert Cecil, under-secretary for for
eign affairs, in the house of commons:
' "I regret to say that it is impossi
ble to speak of Albania as an entitj
at present. In the central area, over
which Essad Pasha's authority ex
tends, the relations between the Ser
bian soldiers and the population have
been friendly and Essad Pasha has
rendered them valuable assistance.
The northern tribes, among whom the
enemy has conducted a considerable
propaganda.'- are hostile to the Ser
bians and Montenegrins." ,
: Recent Operations In Galicia.
Several lengthv despatches have
teen received here giving details of
the recent operations in Eastern GaH
eta, which were so meagerly described
in the official, reports. According to
the despatches the Russians, after
artillery preparation which showed
there was no longer any shortage in
their big gun ammunition, started an
offensive which caused the Austro
Germans - to rush every available di
Vision to Galicia.
-.-Czernowltz is still in the possession
Of the Austrians and is filled with
wounded. -But the Russians appar
ently are directing their main attack
, against eaaagora, nortn oi tne jyuKo
wina capital, where . five important
roads converge. -
'Germans Concentrating at Monastir,
.'In the Balkans reports persist that
the Germans - are concentrating at
Monastir preparatory to an' attack on
Baioniki, but tne interest in tne Mace
donian campaign has become sec.
ondary to the operations of the Aus
trians in Montenegro. A determined
attack is being made on Mount Lov-
ren. Montenegrin stronghold over
looking Cattaro bay by the guns of
the Austrian fortress at Cattaro and
Austrian warships lying in the Adri
atic. The formid?,ble Austrian forces
invading Montenegro extend over
Wide front, from the river Tara in the
West to the' Ipek district in the east.
Meanaees Italy's Dream.
- It cannot he disguised that this in
vaslon is causing great uneasiness
among' the entente power -nd es
pecially Italy; which sees In its suc
cess an end to Italy's dream of dom
inating the Albanian littoral of the
Adriatic. The Italian newspapers in
expressing the opinion that an Aus
trian success against Montenegro
would give the invader, an incalcula
bl political, - marinime, - commercial
and strategiT advantage, admit the

Ml
fear that Italy's intervention in the
Balkan campaign has come too late.
TO MEET THE MENACE OF
GERMAN ECONOMIC WARFARE
Object of a Motion Made in the House
of Commons Yesterday."
London, Jan. 10. 5.17 p. m. To meet
the menace of German economic war
fare, after the guns have had their
say, is the object of a motion made in
the house of commons today by Wil
liam Albert Samuel Hewins,' member
for Hereford, urging the government
to enter into immediate consultation
with the governments of Great Brit
ain's dominions with a view to mobil
izing the whole economic strength of
the empire in co-operation with Great
Britain's allies to nght tne German
system of trading.
"The key to the whole German dlplo
macy Is economic, and the. whole of her
aim is the economic subjection of tne
country she occupies." declared Hew
ins. "She wisbes to ; create a great
central European system and it must
be altogether a western system of
trading." '
.Mr.-Hewins asserted that-Germany,
by a. clever treaty system, had been
able to establish the machinery to
support these - alms', and that" behind
the screen of her military movements
she was carefully organizing the coun
tries she had occupied.
The speaker advocated ' preferential
treatment for British imperial trade
and that of France; notification to. the
Central empires v that the'' British in
tended to wreck the Germanic system
and, Bus he put it, to prevent Germany
exploitation of. the resources of the
British empire by Germany.
ASSERTS GERMANY IS
FEELING FOOD BLOCKADE.
statement by president Hunciman ot
London ' Board of Trade.
London. Jan. 10. 7.45 p. m. Walter
Runciman, president of the board of
trade, - won tremendous applause from
the house of. commons tonight by a
speech in which he declared that the
entente allien must take uteris to see
that Germany is unable to carry on a 1
trade war against them after peace is
signed. -
There arewsIgns.'N he said, "that at
last Germany is beginning to feel the
economic pressure of our blockade. Her
food supplies are becoming depleted
while ours are increasing. Although
our exports have fallen and our im
ports risen, there is no doubt that the
economic strength of Great Britain Is
so well founded that we can stand the
strain far better than the central
powers.
Bread riots in Berlin and in nearly
every other big German city do tiot
occur without good reasons. We have
deprived the enemy of many necessi
ties of warfare and possibly some of
the necessities of life. Her stocks of
raw materials are giving out. Econom
ic pressure, possibly better 'than any
other means, will ultimately persuade
Germany of the fruitlessness of con
tinuing the struggle."
URGING ECONOMIC
PRESSURE ON GERMANY.
Subject of Debate in House of Com-
: mom Last Night.
London. Jan. 10. 11.25 p. m. The de.
bate in the house of commons tonight
was chiefly remarkable for the unani
mlty of the members in urging the
government to exert the largest possi
ble degree of economic pressure on
Germany and in recommending steps
should immediately be taken to pre
vent any menace from German trade
warfare directed against the allies af
ter peace is signed.
A resolution was adopted without
division that, with a view to increasing
the power of the allies in tne prosecu
tion of the war, his majesty s govern'
raeht should enter into immediate con.
sultatlon with the governments of the
dominions in order, with their aid. to
bring the whole economic strength of
the . empire m co-operation with the
allies in a policy directed against the
enemy. -
- The principal speech was made by
Walter Runciman,, president of the
board of trade, whose emphatic decla
rations on the importance of maintain
lnr British trade were regarded ai
largely directed towards making clear
tne position wnicn caused him to hesi
tate to endorse Premier Asquith's
compulsion policy last week.

DIFFICULTY IN SETTLING
LUSITANIA CONTROVERSY.
Bernstorff Has Had Another Confer
ence With Lansing.
Washington, Jan. 10. Difficulty in
agreeing upon the details is delaying
a final settlement of the Lueitania
controversy. Count Von Bernstorff,
the German ambassador, and Secretary
Lansing had another conference today
and it was -said later that no final
agreement had been reached, although
the outlook was encouraging.
While the United States and Ger
many virtually have agreed upon the
essential principles involved, it was
learned tonight that until a method of
expressing - these principles is found
satisfactory to both sides, announce
ment of a settlement will be withheld.
Count Von (Bernstorff was Informed in
effect by Secretary Lansing during to
day's conference tnat tne wording or,
the tentative proposal submitted - last
week by Germany, and since consid
ered by President Wilson, was inade
quate in ceratin respects.
A feeling of optimism regarding the
ultimate outcome of the negotiations
apparently prevails both in official and
Teutonic diplomatic circles. It is free
ly predicted that a settlement accept
able to both governments should be
reached by next Monday, unless un
foreseen events intervene.
By Monday Count Von Bernstorff
should receive a reply to a despatch
prepared tonight for the Berlin foreign
office. ? . , .

ITALIAN LINER WILL
BE DETAINED IN PORT
Pending Negotiations About Removal
of Guna She Carries.
Washington, Jan. 10. The desire of
the United States government that the
three-inch guns mounted on the Italian
liner , Guiseppe Verdi, now at New
York, be removed and the vessel de
part unarmed upon its return voyage,
was expressed informally today to the
Italian ambassador. Count Macchi di
Cellere, by Secretary Lansing. The
secretary's views will be transmitted
to the Italian government and, it Is
said, until reply is received the liner
will be detained in port.
The ambassador called at the state
deDartment twice during the day. con
ferring once with Counsellor Polk and
later with Mr. Lansing. Although
there was no announcement after the
conference, it is understood that the
American government : will adhere
strictly to its policy of opposing the
carrying of mounted guns under any
circumstances by vessela plying out of
United States ports with passengers.
In this connection the question of
responsibility for the safety of passen
gers aboard the vessel has been raised.
The Italian ambassador, it is eaia, con
tends that, the guns afford protection
to the passengers by defending the
vessel from submarines. State depart
ments officials, on the other hand,
maintain that the guns constitute an
element of danger which would not
attend an unarmed vessel. They point
out that the liners Yasaka Maru and
Persia, both, armed for defense, were
sunk,, presumably by submarines which
were afraid to- expose- themselves and
therefore gave no warning.
DISCOVERY, OF STOWAWAYS
CAUSED EXCITEMENT
On 'Japanese Steamer Shinyo Maru
Started Rumors of Bombs.
...
San Francisco, Jan. 10. Excitement
among passengers, caused by. the dis
covery of three stowaways and their
ejection from ;- the vessel, probably
started rumors that two bombs, set
to explode in four hours, were found
on the steamer Shinyo Maru niter she
sailed from here November 2, accord
ing to Lacey Goodrich, general pas
senger agent of the Toyo Kisen Kaisha.
The explanation was given alter the
publication today of ft message in a
letter from Mrs. A. S. Crossfield, wife
of a former judge of the Philippine
Islands territorial court, who was a
p-issenger. The letter was mailed
from Nagasaki, Japan, to her daugh
ter, Miss Ruth Crossfield of San Fran
cisco. Jn this letter Mrs. Crossfield told of
the rumors of bomb plots and asked
"if any German spies had been arrest
ed." UNFAVORABLE REPORTS ON

Misbranding; of
Drugs Unlawful
DECISION OF SUPREME COURT
ENDS TEN YEAR LITIGATION
IN INTERSTATE TRADE
Numerous Actions Against Drug Con
cerns Are Expected to Follow Deci
sion Against a Chicago Drug Com
pany. ;
Washington, Jan. ,10. After ten
years of legislation and litigation, the
supreme court decided today that con
greos had enacted finally a constitu
tional law regulating statements as to
the curative effects of medicines in in
terstate commerce. The decision was
prepared by Justice Hughes. Numer
ous actions against drug concerns are
expected to follow.
Misbranded Drugs.
For a ltme it was urged by govern
ment officials that the 1908 pure food
law designed as misbranded drugs or
medicines which were accompanied in
inteftate commerce by knowingly
false statements about the curative ef
fects of the compounds. The supreme
court decided, however, that the 1906
law applied only to misbranding as to
the Identity or composition or drugs.
8hertey Amendment.
In response to a resulting message
from .President Tart, congress in taiz
enacted the Sherley amendment, which
the supreme court held today struck
precisely at misstatements either on
the label or in printed circulars ac
company ing medicines.
"We find no ground," said Justice
Hughes, "for saying that congress may
not condemn Interstate transportation
of swindling preparations accompanied
by false and fraudulent statements i
well as lottery tickets."
False and Fraudulent Statements.
The justice held that congress had
not entered the field of difference of
opinions between schools and practi
tioners, but had merely sought to ex
elude "false and fraudulent" etate
ments from interstate commerce. He
held the law was not speculative ia
its nature, because Intent to deceive
was a fact as susceptible as other facta
in everyday life.
Against Chicago Drug Concern.
The decision was announced in the
case of a Chicago drug concern which
shipped medicine from - Chicago to
Omaha described in an accompanying
circular as a compound which It knew
had cured and would cure tuberculosis.
The government proceeded under the
Sherley amendment to confiscate the
product and the Nebraska federal dls
trlct court condemned the shipments.
This action was affirmed today by the
supreme court.

but such great hostility to Buxton's
views was manifested by the audience
that hardly a complete sentence could
be heard.
Mr. Buxton ' attempted to speak on
the freedom of the seas, but those in
the hall demanded whether he meant
freedom for Germany's submarines to
kill women and children. He replied:
There will be no difficulty in get
ting guarantees from Germany."
What good are guarantees rrom
Germany?" was shouted by some of
the audience and there was a great
outbreak, which lasted until the meet
ing was brougnt to an end.
