Nebraska Commission
Asks for Rehearing
on Advance in Rates
LINCOLN, Neb., Jan. 10. A rehearing
ln the western interstate passenger rate
case, as It affects Nebraska, was today
requested of the Interstate Commerce
commission by Attorney General Reed of
Nebraska and the Nebraska Railway
commission. The request was mailed to
Washington. The Nebraska officials are
acting Independently, but invite other
states to Join them in their request,
which Is based on the allegation that
required matter relative to Nebraska
conditions was not submitted in the
previous hearing. It Is further argued
that low grades and other facts regard
ing passenger traffic ln Nebraska leave
cause for doubt as to the necessity for
increased rates for travel through the
state.
Southerners Fight
Child Labor Bill
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10,-Representa-tlves
of southern cotton mills, headed

bill to prevent interstate shipment of
goods manufactured with the aid of
child labor. Mr. Kltchin said the bill
was opposed as unconstitutional and
unwise.
"We of the south oppose this measure
because we believe our people who have
to work should be permitted to do so,"
he said. "I recall a diapaich from Bos
ton on January 1, 1916. that 125 persons
were gleaning food from garbage piles.
If the north cannot support Ita poor, you
should not expect the south to do so.

LONDON, Jan. Irt.-The Turks In Meso
potamia were In full retreat on January
9 with the British pursuing them, it
was announced in the House of Com
mons today by J. Austen Chamberlain,
secretary for India.
There had been heavy fighting on both
banks of the Tigris on January 7, Mr.
Chamberlain's announcement stated, and
the British had taken two Turkish guns
and 700 prisoners.
In telling the Commons the news of
the British success on the Tigris, Mr.
Chamberlain said:
"General Alymer left Mlam Alllgarbl,
January 6, with troops marching to the
relief of Kut-El-Amar. On the same day
General Townsend at Kut, reported
that the previous night the enemy had
opened a heavy fire on the northwest
front and on the village opposite Kut,
but had made, no attack. On the nbzhtj
of January 7 General Alymer reported
heavy firing on the south front bank of
I the Tigris.
"On tha right bank General Campbell's
column carried the enemy's position,
taking (o guns and 700 prisoners and
then cntrorched. Meanwhile ' the main
attack on the left bank was retarded
by an cnerpy outflanking movement' and
General Alymer reported that ho ap
parently wit opposed by three Turkish
divisions.
"On the evening of January 8, he re
ported that owing to fatigue, the troops
had been unable to make any progress
that day.' On tho ninth he reported tho
enemy ln retreat and that he was pursu
ing, but that heavy rains hindered the
pursuit.
"From later telegrams It appears the
enemy has reached Khora." .
British Loae Three Thousand.
AMSTERDAM, Jan. 10. (Via London.)
A British force which apparently was
on tho way to reinforce the British at
Kut-El-Amar on the Tigris river, lost
S.000 men ln an attack on Turkish posi
tions at Sheik Said, according to a
semi-official statement received today
from Constantinople. The attack Is de
clared to havo been repulsed.
The statement follows:
"On the Irak front the enemy, whose
strength is estimated at one division,
which was stationed at Mlam Alllgarbl,
In order to come to the rescue at Kut-El-Amar
on January 6 and 7, under the
protection of four gunboats, attacked our
positions at Sheik Said, but was repulsed
by our counter attack.
"We made some prisoners. The enemy
losses are estimated at 3,000. The enemy
cavalry suffered especially Bevere losses."
Although the Berlin report of the Brit
ish retreat in Mesopotamia appears to be
at variance with the British announce
ment that the Turks are falling back
after heavy fighting. Mr. Chamberlain's
statement to the House of Commons does
not disclose the point at which the en
gagement referred to occurred. It is pos
sible that this action took place some
where south of Kut-El-Amara between
the Turks and the main body of the
British.
BERLIN, Jan. 10.-(By Wireless to Say
vllle.) The British army at Kut-el-Amara
ln Mesopotamia has now been surrounded
completely by the Turks, according la

BROWNING'S DEATH
IS INVESTIGATED
County Attorney Magney Grants Re
quest of Dead Man's Brother
for New Inquiry.
COMES HERE FROM WASHINGTON
William L. Browning, a lawyer,
of Washington, D. C, brother of the
late Henry M. Browning of Omaha,
who died June 25 as the result of
swallowing bichloride of mercury
tablets, late yesterday asked County
Attorney Magney to make an investi
gation of the circumstances relating
to bis brother's death.
Mr. Browning presented a number
of facts for the county attorney's
consideration, after which Mr. Mag
ney said he would initiate an investi
gation. "l have asked Mr. Browning to consult
with several person who live In Omaha,"
Bald the oounty attorney, "and to gather
all the evidence relating to the death of
his brother which he can secure. I will
then make an Investigation."
Opposes Nnlrlde Theory.
"The members of tho family have
never belloved that my brother's death
was caused by suicide," said William L,
Browning, who Is stopping at the Fontc
nelle, laAt night. "I have been prevented
from taking action previously by a num
ber of matters. I regret that I was un
able to be here immediately after his
death, as I would have Insisted upon a
thorough Investigation at that time."
It will be recalled that the dead man
was manager of the Scott Advertising
company in charge of street car adver
tising ln Omaha. Ho was popular in busi
ness circles In Omaha and both he and
his beautiful wife, to whom he had been
married only n, few months prior to his
death, were prominent in many local so
cial circles.
Early last fall friends of the Browning
family In Omaha were startled to learn
of another marriage which the widow
contracted within n, few weeks after the
Inquest. Information of the wedding was
sent to tho probate court here In accord
ance with a statute of the state of Con
necticut, where the ceremony took place.
Carried .Much Life Insurance.
Mr. Browning had carried a large
amount of life insurance. Including heavy
accident Insurance, a settlement being
made by Mrs. Browning with the Insur
ance companies for S13,t00.
Henry M. Browning was the father of
an 8-year-old daughter, Audrey, by a pre
vious marriage, ln whose welfare, accord
ing to William L. Browning, the family
Is greatly Interested. Considerations con
cerning her, he said, have been one of the
reasons why no action has been previ
ously taken relating to an investigation.
Mr. Browning execta to confer today
with Howard If. Baldrlge, Omaha attor
ney, who represented Mrs. Browning,
concerning tho death of his brother. He
will return to Washington tonight, he
said.

LUSITANIA. CASE
NEAR SETTLEMENT
Germany Will Pay Indemnity for
Americans, but Form of Disa
vowal Still Unsettled.
BERNStORFF CALLS ON LANSING
. WASHINGTON, Jan. 10. Count
Von Bernstorff, the German ambas
sador, and Secretary Lansing had
another conference In tho Lusltanla
negotiations today, which both
agreed should he described aB confi
dential. Tbe ambassador expects to have
only one more conference with the
secretary and that inside of a week.
This fact is taken to mean that only
one more exchange between Wash
ington and Berlin 'a necessary be
fore tbe long controversy is ended.
American officials reflected the view
that a satisfactory settlement Is In sight
which will include Indemnities for tho
115 American lives lost and a satisfactory
expression of regret or disavowal.
It Is known that the principal point
which has been dolaying settlement Is the
phraseology.
Germany has contended
that the best disavowal It could offer was
Its orders to submarine commanders not
to repeat such an Incident, and that It
could not disavow the action, although It
regretted the loss of so many Americans.
The United Sta'es has been contending
that the disavowal should be expressed In
some way.
It was stated authoritatively today that
the next step of tho United States will be
to ask all allies of Germany to agree
that no vessels carrying Americans be
attacked until pnKsengers and crew have
been placed ln fcafety.
The Impression grows among adminis
tration officials that the nationality of
the submarine or mlno which sank the
Persia never will be disclosed.

Famous Italian
Sculptor Dies of
1 ' GasPoisoning
PARIS, Jan. 10. The Italian animal
sculptor, 'Rembrandt Bugatti, was found
lylnr unconscious yesterday In his studio
in Rue Joath Bars. A physician -who
was summoned said the sculptor was
sufferlnc from ku nnlannlnv. A vaa 1t
, ,ho BtU(10 waJI turned on. Bugattl
was taken to Laenneo hospital, where be
dlad.
The work of Pig nor Bugattl, who was
regarded as one of the foremost living
sculptors, is represented In most of the
galleries of Europe, When the war
opened he was modeling animals at the
Zoological Gardens In Antwerp. He gave
up this work and devoted himself to
assisting the Belgian ambulance corps.
When Antwerp was evacuated he went
to Holland, thence to Italy, but as his
class was not mobilised he came to
I'arls.
Of late months the war seemed to
have affected the sculptor profoundly.
He was greatly depressed by the suffer
ings of the Belgians, for whom he had
great admiration. He frequently pointed
to the ribbon of the legion of Honor In
his buttonhole and said:
"I ought to give It to some mutilated
Belgian soldier." . ,
Klgnor Bugattl gave up some time ago
his work in the specialty which won
his fume,, saying: "Tills la not the time
to make animals." . He devoted, himself
entirely . to a new Interpretation of
Christ. This work, now at the foundry,
is his last.

"The Berlin newspapers," continues the
