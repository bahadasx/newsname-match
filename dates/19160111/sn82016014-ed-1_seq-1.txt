It is not the intention to let In

Kansans are moving to the larger

the showing of heavy losses in both
cities. Wichita is hit by a loss of
more than 6,000 over the assssor"s
returns for a year ago, while Topeka
suffered a loss of 3,000. A year ago,
the assessor's returns for Topeka were
so flagrantly inaccurate that the
state board refused to accept the

Phone Operators Relayed Com

Bennington, Kan., Jan. 11. A long
distance telephone message from
northwest Oklahoma was received by
William Smith, living several miles
north of here near the station of Wells
on the Manchester-Barnard branch of
the Santa Fe. to the effect that Air.
Smith's father, E. J. Smith, had died;
that the remains were being brought
home, and as there would be no Sun
day train on the branch instructions'
were to meet the train at Manchester
that is the way William Smith got it.
Accordingly the services of an un
dertaker at Minneapolis were engaged,
and since there was no good reason
for postponing the funeral which
might as well be that afternoon, brief
services were held at the little church
in Wells after which the funeral party
with hearse and undertaker went to
Manchester, the train arriving soon
after.
There is something passing strange

fact that but two passengers1 stepped
off the train, and not until the elder
of the two slapped one of the by

Hid In Wooden
Cow and Killed
Three Germans
Paris, Jan. 11. The nearest thing in
this war to the famous Horse of Troy
is told of in a French soldier's letter
from a base hospital at the front. It
was a wooden cow in this case and
thereby hangs the story of how the
soldier happened to be in hospital.
The French trenches at this soldier's
particular part of the front were fifty
yards from the German trenches. A
harmless old cow relieved trench mo
notony each day by grazing between
the lines. The French and German
soldiers finally came to an understand
ing that the opposing lines should al
ternately have the opportunity of
milking the cow and be immune from
attack during the operation. This
went on for some time until a French i
officer suspected that the Germans j and ten cent store was the next to sui

MENACE ON TRIAL
Publishers of Anti-Catholic
Paper Get Into Court.
Charged With Sending Obscene
.Literature Through Mails.
TRIAL BEING HELD IN JOPLIN
Paper Has Made Bitter Attacks
on Roman Catholic Church.
Four Men Are Under Indict
ment on Fight Counts.
Joplin. Mo.. Jan. 11. Selection of
a jury promised to be slow procedure
today in the trial of four men alleged
to have been connected with the Men
ace Publishing company of Aurora,
Mo., and who are charged in federal
court hre with sending alleged ob
scene matter through the malls. Early
in the proceedings Judge Arba S. Van
Valkenberg ruled that the mere fact
that a prospective Juror was a sub
scriber to the Menace, a weekly news
paper, would not disqualify him from
jury service in the case.
The newspaper published by the
Menace Publishing company was
charged by the district attorney with
being unfriendly to the Catholic
church. In examining the talesmen,
Mr. Wilson declared however, that the
case was not based upon the question
of religious belief but solely upon the
question whether the laws relating to
sending of obscene or Indecent mat
ter in the mails had been violated. ,
One Count Dismissed.
Objections to Mr. Wilson's questions
to th talesmen were frequent on the
part of J. I. Sheppard, chief of coun
sel for the defendants.
One count of the indictment against
the defendants was dismissed at the
request of the government prosecutor,
as he introduced the case. This count
was leveled at the alleged publication
of an advertisement as to where might
be procured a book said to bear the
title: "The Pope. Chief of White Slav-
ers and Hi(?h Priest of Intrigue."
Seven counts remained against tho
defendants, charging the circulation
through the mails of certain articles
and passages alleged to have been
printed in the newspapers and the
book referred to.
Federal Grand Jury Indictments.
Indictments were returned against
the Menace Publishing company, a
corporation having its offices in Au

British Still Hopeful.
Though details are almost complete

Turks encircled the British right at
Kut-El-Amara, throwing a strong
force between the garrison and th
River Tigris. Constantinople reported
such an encircling movement in prog

Defenses were first built by the Turks,

largely of nuts, ground cereals and

Guards of impressive appearance
threatened to oust any correspondent
