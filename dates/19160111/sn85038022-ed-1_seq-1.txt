following nrtlclo of a gentleman who
Is ob well known and liked In Mays
vllie ns in Cincinnati:
PpstmaBtcr John Layton Shuff sent
his resignation to President Wilson
and Postmaster General Burleson
Monday to become cffcctlvo with tho
appointment of his successor. Mr.
Snuff's resignation followed Immedi
ately the action of tho board of direc
tors of tho Union Contral-Llfo Insur
ance Company, appointing him man
ager of tho Homo Offlco Goncral
agency. Tho latter appointment was
announced by President Jesse R.
Clark of tho Insurance company and
within a few minutes tho telegrams
carrying tho resignation wcro on their
way to Washington. Tho name of Mr.
Shuff's successor at tho head of tho
Cincinnati postofflco has not been men
tioned, as no word of tho proposed res
ignation leaked out prior to tho of
ficial announcement.
The now position to bo assumed by
Mr. Shuff is ono of tho most responsi
ble In the life Insurance field In Am
erica. Ho will have control of all
Insurance written by IiIb company In
this territory and, with the location of
the home office here, this means a tre
mendous volume of business. Tho
emoluments of tho position arc said to
bo vory large. Tho into K. W. Jewell,
who passed away last August, was
Cincinnati agent for many years and
it Is the position occupied by him that
will be filled by Mr. Shuff.
John L. Shuff was postmaster Just
ono year. lie assumed the omcc on
January 7, 1915, succeeding Ellas R.
Monfort. A striking feature of his ap
pointment, disclosing his wonderful
acquaintance, was that following the
confirmation of his appointment by the
Senate ho stood In tho lobby of the
Capitol and twenty-one Senators came
along and called hi in "Jack."
