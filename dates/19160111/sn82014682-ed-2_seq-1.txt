BUDGET RUSE OF
BOARD LIKELY TO
BE OF NO AVAIL
Change of Date f of Fiscal Year
May Prove Illegal, in Opinion
of Deputy Attorney General
A. G. Smith
LICENSE M0nIy TO TUNE
OF $50,000 MAY BE SHY
Probable That None of Fat
Fund Can Be Used Before
July 1; Deficit of $131,000
May Be Faced on June 30
By a ruse yesterday in the setting
of a flacal year, the supervisor in
caucus tried to ease a burden from
their shoulders and give themselves
hlv months more of grace tn which to
dry their feet, so to speak, from the
deep -vading in the city funds they
havo been doing since taking office.
But did they, when they voted to
place the fiscal year upon & new basis
from July to July instead of from
January to December as formerly the
custom; really benefit themselves as
much as appeared at the moment?
That they did not really bring about
a lasting benefit and that they may
yet withdraw from the idea and not
pass the resolution on Its final read
ing was the feeling expressed from va
rious parts of the city hall today.
Figures for End of June.
Figures prepared by the auditor's
department seem to show that when
next June rolls around the seven city
fathers will not be In a much better
condition io far at deficits go, than
they are at the present time. The fig
ures are as follows:
Taxes from the territory, naif
year ...........-...,$202,000
Poll and dog taxes 20,000
Receipts, at fines and costs... 45,000
: Total receipts .......'.....$267,000
Previous deficit. .... ... ..... $147,000
Reduced by transfers and by
abolishing water commission 47,000
Still to pay . .'. . ..... .. .$100,000
Difference between receipts '
and the present deficit ..... 167,000
Bill of appropriations ........ 298,480
This leaves, after paying as much
of the appropriation bill as possible, a
i - difference between $298,480 and $167.
0O0 of '131,490, or a deficit In June
of practically as mucn as the board
faced in December.
"Should Have Faced Music
Though both Deputy Attorneys A.
M. Cristy and W. T. Carden emphatic
ally declare that the fiscal year may
be changed without trouble, and that
there is nothing standing in the way
of the change legally, other officials
in the city hall are of the opinion that
the step was not a wise one, and that
the board should rather have faced
the music as it came than to seek to
protect themselves by the change.
- Attorney General I. M. Stalnback
would not venture an opinion in the
question this morning, as he had not
given it any consideration, and said
that he would want to consider it well
before saying anything for or against
the proposition.
Arthur G. Smith says that he has
considered the question in an off hand
: way, but that he has not gone into it
deeply at alL ' He remarked that at a
glance it seems the board may run
against a good many snags in making
such a change. t
One of these snags may be the
books of -the auditor, which have al
ways been balanced according to the
calendar year and not according to a
year subdivided as the resolution of
yesterday would have it
It shall be the duty of the auditor.

Fortune Falls On
: Man Who Was Last
Here As Stowaway
On November 4, last year, the Star
Bulletin printed the story that W. G.
Decker, American businessman, was a
stowaway on the Oceanic liner So
noma, working his way from Australia
to San Francisco. He was penniless
having "gone busted" in the colonies,
largely because of anti-American sen
timent there. He had left his wife in
Australia, to follow him when he
could get to the states, save up some
money, and send it to her.
The sequel and It is a happy one
came in a letter to the Star-Bulletin
today from Decker, written on the sta
tionery of the Palace Hotel, San Fran
cisco. The erstwhile stowaway writes:
-It might Interest you to know that
the stowaway that arrived on the So
noma in November struck it lucky in
.San Francisco. I Inherited $75,000
and have sent fcr my wife. Mrs.
Decker will arrive on the Niagara
from Sydney January 7 and stop at
the. Alexander Young until January 12,
then leaving on tl j Matsonia for San
Francisco."
Inquiry at the Young established the
fact that Mrs. DtcKer had been ex
pected there but du not arrive on the
Niagara. It is presumed she will
come on tne nexi sieamer.

Grand Jury Recommends Ex
pert Study and Then Am
1 - pie Extensions 7
Recommending a filtration plant for
Nuuanu and buggesting the possibility
of charging undeveloped property for
water-mains laid along the front, the
territorial grand jury's report for 1915
takes up the water-, and sewer prob
lems in a vigorous manner.:
ThU part of the long report made
yesterday is of much general interest
in view of the present discussion over
waterworks development. The grand
jury proposes bond issues for water
and sewer system extensions, but only
after comprehensive plans and studies
have been made.
The report upon these subjects is as
follows:
"In the case of Honolulu, where 90
per cent of the privileges are - flat
rates, a frequent inspection of all fix
tures should be made in order to keep
the waste and leakage reduced to a
minimum. Water closets will get out
of order; urinals will become opened
too full, and rigid rules to conserve
the supply, and a rigid enforcement of
such rules are imperative against
those who wilfully abuse the flat-rate
privilege.
"Wherever such conditions of waste
fulness prevail, the department should
very promptly enforce meterage or
shut off the supply. Indeed, meter
age to begin with is the only fair or
equitable way to sell water; and as
we approach the entirely metered sys-

; WASIIlNtiTOX, I). Jan. 11 President Wilson 's policy con
cerning the European war is the overwhelming issue of the hour
for the United States, and the issue on which the'.. Democratic party
must hope for success in the coming national elect ion, declared Fran
cis G. Newlands, senator from Nevada, today in a significant speech
in the upper house.
In the course of an address in which he strongly criticized his
own party, the Ncvadari predicted probable defeat for the Demo
crats unless the war continues through the coming campaign.
Senator Newlands, attacked the record of Democracy since the
party came into power by the election of 1912, criticizing the. tariff
and banking legislation which the Democrats allege have brought
needed reforms. He asserted that because there has been industrial
and commercial depression at the same time as the Democrats have
been in control, the party is in danger of defeat at the next presi
dential election unless the war continues. He made the president

LONDON, Eng., Jan. 11. The debate on the second reading of

the part of government leaders to force the bill to passage. It is
now believed that the vote in favor of the bill will prove greater
than that given the much-discussed measure on first reading. It. is
thought that a few radicals will resist the measure to the end, but
John Redmond announced today that the Nationalists will offer no
