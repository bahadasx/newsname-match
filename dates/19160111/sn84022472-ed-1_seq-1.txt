- ' ' .That the ideal weather conditions'prevailing off the coast
of Ireland on.My 7, when, the Lusitania. was torpedoed, indi-
J recti y contributed to the enormity of the greajt " sea trag-edy: wets
the paradoxical statement; with, which James H. Brooks, 502
Colorado avenue, salesman for the American Chain Co., a Lusi
tania 'survivor, prefaced 'a thrillmg story of his td venture) on
the liner, before select pirty'o'f friends in Stratford last even?
7 v Brooks declares that ihe calm weather and comparatively
high, temperature had resulted in the opening of all the , port
holes of ihe'vessel'to within 15 feet of the -water line. Conse
quently, when the torpedoed vessel began to list,, there was a
trenehdous rush of watec through the; portholes which precipi
tated -the sinkings v C '-" " ' ''
Without the water rushing through the portholes, he be
... lieves'the Lusitania wbuld haye'been able to ground on the Irish
coast. ..lie , says, also, that without 'the open portholes, there
would 'not have besn such a' short time before the vessel listed
so"as to make the manning "of the life boats soMifficult. ' '
x- Brooks revealed, also, facts which he said have been strick
en from the official record of the inquiry into the disaster. These
had to do with the conduct of the eaptain and the crew. Brooks
declares. the captain of the Lusitania ordered his oriw to vstop
lowering the. life boats that everything was -all right." He
tells of seeing-members of-the: crew still at wofk on the" life
boats, in defiance of the captain's ordets, and showering gener
ous curses upon that official's head as they toiled with the life
- boats-., V- ' ' , ' . n. -' " ' . '

E Packard, D. D.. the pastor.
Coming to the time of the torpedo
ing. Mr. Brooks told how it was Just
about 2 o' clock, when hw cairie on the
boat deck and met a man arid woman
-who perished They - wanted him to
play shuffle-board ; Just before the
Marconi deck which was between the
foremost funnel of the jship.r The sea
1 was perfectly calm, with almost a
glassy appearance except for the rip
i pies created by the motion of the 750
' foot leviathan, traveling- in 350 feet of
water.- " .il ' - - ' v
' - On. the starboard side was the open
- eea. sadMr. Brooks. . Ireland was on
the port side. , ' ' i
"We were Jusi about, to make a turn
towards Qiieenstown harboi instead of
disembarking in tenders as is usual,"
eald he,' taking his auditors into the
i scene of the disaster. -. :
"Note this one thing, for it hasx a
v materia bearing on w"hat later hap
pened: It , was a beautifully warm
dar. above, though the water had
tested 52' degrees earlier ! the day; i
' every por hole on all decks to. wltnin
15 feet of the water l"ne was open.
'"I told my friends to- wait ya. minute
; and that I would be back as I wanted
first to get sight ' of Ireland's shore
and then would go below for : a. few
moments and when I came up would
bring another couple of players to
complete the game. ,
I Saw Torpedo's Course.
. "I. was just stepping behind the
steel sheathed Marconigram station
when X heard, my friends say, 'Brooks,
come back a moment. I turned and
saw about 300 yards distant the course
of a torpedo, -coming at approximately
' ,35v,milea an hour. I knew it instantly
and noticed that it was going to hit
tha .yessel well forward., So interested
was I Tn the sight a beautif ur one
'J.' that I forgot all fear 'and even went
. down to the starboard rail to see it
strike the sldexaf the vessel, believing
that It -would explode externally and
' that although, it might make a hole it
would not sink the vessel. I remem
ber even leaning far outward over the
rail to see its exact pointvof contact.
' , r. learned ' later that ' torpedoes do
not explode as I believed. , '
"In a. few seconds, the torpedo had
struck and disappeared. A fraction
of a. second later there was a dull
roar internally and the " forward sec
tion of the boat between the funnels
seemed to rise upward with a shower
of coal, splinters and , debris of all
J- kinds, flying I should say, about 150
feet in .the air- ' , .
- "My 'presence of mind seemed to
tell me tjiat I should get behind the
steel sheathing of the - Marconi house
to prevent being hit by "the flying
pieces , of deck and other debris. I
had Just taken three steps , when I
was suddenly struck down by a great
weight upon the back and literally
flattened out upon te deck. I was ter
ribly bruised even beneath the arms,
which were thrown above my head.
Others had the same experience and
later I learned that it was the huge
-volume of water which' always flies
.upward like a geyser when a -torpedo
explodes." , , " ' ' : :
The speaker said the couple who
were talking with him were thrown
flat and, like -Brooks, both had coal
dust driven, right into their skins. All
looked like coal heavers.
. i "For a moment the boat listed over
to port and seemed, to remain there
an indefinite period. It then righted
and, continued to sink slowly by the

Assistant Attorney General Phillips,
outlining the state's .case, declared the

BAR MAY BE OPEN
PENDING- DECISION
Counsel vfor: Liquor Dealer
Announces Intention of
Carrying On Fight
The Pastors' ' association will join
the TJnivetsalist church, in fighting
Prof.- James Atlas, as the latter has
decided to appeal from the decision
of the county commissioners who yes
terday afternoon denied a renewal of
the Hotel Atlas liquor ;.-license. Al
though the members of the Pastors'
association did not file a. remonstrance
against the hotel they contributed
toward the fund' raised for, Jegal ex
penses. They are prepared to lend
moral as well as financial, aid now
that' the superior court is called upon
to review the evidence.
- It was Rev. William W. Rose and
his congregation at the Universalist
church who bore "the brunt, of the bat
tle against Prof. Atlas in the hearing
before the commissioners. The First
M. E. church was not" asked to contri
bute toward the expense fund but in
case of ah appeal this church will be
asked for a contribution.' It is near
the hotel and the members are anx
ious to have the license taken away.
Rev. George M. Brown tf this church
proved an important -.witness for the
remonstrants at the hearing.
. The county commissioners- said this
morning; that they . have not yet re
ceived notice that Atlas will appeal
.from their decision. Ee has 10 days
in which to- file an appeal and mean
while he is allowed, under the law, to
keep his place open while the decision
on his appeal is pending in the court.
. The decision of the commissioners,
denying .the renewal, was not much of
a surprise. The weight of. the testi
mony, against the applicant caused
those who - attended the hearings to
feel certain that-the license was sure
to go. '
Attorney .Daniel E. Brennan, of
counsel - for Prof. Atlas, stated this
afternoon that It had been decided to
take an appeal. He said the case
would be fought to a finish 'in the su

Health Inspectors, Without

FIND SHOCKINGLY
POOR CONDITIONS
Give Officials One Week In
Which to Make Them
' More Sanitary
Dust-laden, filthy and unquestion
ably insanitary, are the trolley cars
running on tlie lines of the Connecti
cut Co., in. the streets of thus city, .ac
cording to a report made public today
by C. Howard JJunb-i?,, clerk of the
board of health. '
Every, car running- through the
streets of Bridgeport must be thor
oughly cleansed by scru' -ing', dusted
in ' a proper manner- an be able to
pass inspection of the board of health
one week from today, otherwise they
will be removed . from the streets of
the city by order 'if the board and
prosecution will follow, according to
Dunbar. ,
Dressed in civilian attire, the three
santary health inspectors, Dunbar,
Louis j. Hilzsinger and Michael J.
Toomey, visited the car barns on Con
gress' street at 4 o'clock this morning,
unknown even to the night watchmen
at the barns, i The three inspectors
passed uhnnoticed into tTiS car barns
and in an hour had inspected 110 cars
before their presence was know, to
the despatcher.
Out of the 110 cars inspected, Clerk
Dunbar ; Aports finding but two cars
that . would pass muster. Hanging
strap wooden supporters wsre dust
laden," windows were, dirty, floors were
laden with dirt, foul smells permeated
the cars, tobacco juice is reported as
being visible on the, platforms" of the
cars and the interior of one car' was
found in a deplorable condition. ,
Clerk Dunbar says that the officials
of the Connecticut Co. were notified to
clean the cars a week ago and to see
if the order had ben complied with,
the inspectors made the early morn
ing raid on the car barns. , ,
The; number of every cat- was taken
by he inspectors and it was found
that "cars No. 102 ' and 108 lettered
"New York & Stamford" were the
most insanitary of all. Several of the
newly purchased cars were also said
to be covered with dust. ' .
At the next meeting of the board of
health, a set of sanitary, rules to be
complied with by the officials of the
traction , company will be drawn up
and a copy of them will be forwarded
to the superintendent.
The two green cars on the JDanbury
& Bridgeport trolley , line were ' in a
disgraceful condition, according to
Clerk ; Dunbar. These two cars . are
stored in the barns of the Connec
ticut Co., but it is said, that they are
not cared for as they should be ac
cording to - the contract drawn up be
tween the two companies. '
No car cleaners -were visible upon
the raid of the inspectors and only
four men are . employed as cleaners.
Officials of the company say that they
are -unable to procure sufficient help
to clean the cars but employes of tjhe
company say that sufficient wages and
treatment are not afforded the em
ployes and there is no incentive for
them to hold their Jobs.
Superintendent Charles H. Chapman
pleaded ignorance of i the raid made
by the Health Inspectors. , He said
that he could not even say whether or
not the trolley cars were sanitary, and
until such time as he could make an
investigation he would not discuss the
matter. . ' ,
Cleric, Dunbar filed his report with
the Health commissioners today and
the matter will be held in abeyance
for one week when the inspectors will
again visit the car barns and see if
the order of the board has been-complied
with. . If not, prosecution of the
officials of the Connecticut .company
will follow according to officials of the
Health department.
'Clerk' Dunbar ' said that the jitney
.cars were also taking on an insanitary
'appearance' and several of them' will
be notified to clean up today.
One lunch wagon on : Main street
and an o4her in East Bridgeport were
closed by order of the board of Health
this morning. These places have no
jSewer connection and for this reason
they are rated as being insanitary. '
