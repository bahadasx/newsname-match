WASHINGTON, Jan. ll. The ad
ministration will force the 4.zt to
have the United States prepared for
war. Convinced that the -danger f
serious trouble in the international
situation has been averted, Pres't
Wilson today turned his attention to
his legislative program.
lie held a lengthy conference with
Chairman Hay of the- house military
affairs committee, and urgel that
congress ''speed up" the larger army
hill. loiter he will confer with
Chairman Padgett of the house
naval affairs committee, and Sens.
Camberlain and Tillman of the sen
ate army and navy committees and
Urse them to cooperate with him.
Then the president, if nothing un
forseen develops, will get before the
public certain information which he
believes will swing public sentiment
into line for the larger army and
navy.
To Appeal to People.
Administration, officials admit that
at present the preparedness pro
gram seems doomed. The president
does not yet know hov he will ko
about trying to bring' public senti
ment to aid in reviving the suggest
ed legislation. The general plan
unuVr consideration calls for the
president to accept invitations to
make three speeches at certain
places in the country and also to
Avrite one or two letters to persons
later to be selected in which he will
give his reasons why preparedness
must prevail
In eloing this, however, officials
admit that the president and former
Sec'y of State Bryan must clash and
they are not certain just what effect
such a clash will have on the po
litical fortunes of the president. His
political advisers. Sec'y Tumulty.
Sen. Ollie James. Fred Lynch of
Minnesota, and Thomas J. Pence,
secretary of the democratic national
committee, are trying to determine
this. And they will be the men who

PIECES OF ROPE
Identification of Clothes Line
May Lead to Arrest of
Slayers of Two Men.
Identitication of half a dozen
lengths of clothes line will bind to
gether the slender threads of evi
dence which have been collected
against the slayers of Henry Muessel
and Frank Chrubot. declared Chief
of Detectives John P.. Kuespert Tues
day morning.
"The identification ef this rope
will forge the strongest link in the
chain of evidence which has lead us
to believe that we are close on the
trail of the murderers," asserted
Kuespert." This clothes line has
been used and is weathered and was
probably stolen from some back
yard. If there is anyone in South
Pend who missed a clothes line
around about the time the double
slaying took place, on Dec. 2'). it
is greatly desired that they come to
the police station and attempt to
identify the rope which was carried
by the bandits."
Owner Is Sought.
There are several ways by whi h
this rope could be identified. Kues
pert believes that any woman who
used a clothes line for any period
of time could identify her own im
mediately and therefore is exceed
ingly anxious that citizens anxious
to aid In the capture of the murder
ers report such instancs of stolen
rope.
There are several lengths of the
rope at the police station -which
were picked up at the scene of the
murder and dhers which were in
the coat of one of the slayers found
in a haystack west of the city a few
days ago. The rope was carried by
the bandits for the purpose of tying
up their victims.
Lino Looks Now.
Although the rope is practically
new it shows signs of having been
exposed to the weather considerably
and there appear to be little doubt
but that It once served the purpose
of a clothes line. Thus far the po
lice have "been unable to unearth
one instance of stolen clothes lines
near the time of the murders but be
lieve that the matter may have been
considered too trivial to report to
the department.
"We urge that if any one lost such
a rope to please come to the police
station and see if that which we
have here belongs to them." declared
Chief of Police Millard I. Kerr, inj
discussing tne case.
Although Kuespert says that the
evidence which is being worked on
at the present time all points to
certain persons and if a few more
minor question. can be cleared up
the Muessel-Chrobot murderers will!
he charged with the crime.
There was a report here Tuesday
that two men had been arrested in
Henderson, Ky., at the request of
the South Pend department. This
was denied by Chief Kuespert, who
said that he had not heard of the
arrests, neither had he ordered such
arrests and branded the story as an
unfounded rumor.

CHICAGO, Jan. 11. Determined,
It is believed, to bring about the
nomination of Th?odore Roosevelt
for president by the republican na
tional convention here on June 7,
leaders of the progressive party
went into conference in the Flor
entine room of thi Congress hotel
today. The meeting was not called
to order until after a lengthy tele
gram had been received from Col.
lioosevelt. The telegram bristled
with the theme of preparedness.
The plan by which the progres
sives hope to force Col. ltoosevelt'a
nomination upon the republicans
was outlined by Frank Funk, candi
date for governor of Illinois in 1912.
Up to Republicans.
"We likely will decide today to
hold our convention here the same
week the republicans meet," said
Funk. "If the republicans plan to
nominct3 their presidential candi
date on Thursday, we will nominate
Roosevelt on Wednesday. Then, un
less the G. O. P. nominates Roose
velt, it is certain that there will be
a third ticket in the field.
"With ' Roosevelt's name mention
ed in the republican convention,
there will be a stampede. The dele
gates will see the futility of trying
to nominate any other candidate and
they will choose the only way to
victory that is, to ratify the pro
gressive nomination of Roosevelt."
The progressive leaders went into
their conference behind closed doors,
but on the first motion it was de
cided to admit representatives of the
press. Col. Roosevelt's telegram,
which was read to the conferees,
was enthusiastically received. The
telegram said:
Sends His Grtxtiii:;s,
"I send you my hearty greetings.
We as a country art; facing a great
world crisis, in which for the past 18
months this nation ha: fallen far
short of its duty, both to its own
people and to the law abiding and
justice-loving nations of mankind.
"There is a crying need that we
shall cast aside all purely partisan
considerations and disregard all but
the vital issues affecting the na
tional life, and shall strive whole
heartedly for a sound Americanism
which shall insist that every man
who is within its borders shall be an
American and 'nothing else.
"We must do justice to our own
people at home; we must insist that
they have justice when abroad. Wo
must insist upon the most thorough
going preparedness to protect our
rights against all possible attacks
by an aggressor. Such preparedness
is the best guarantee of honorable
peace. We must remember that
there cannot be such preparedness

fit to perform its high and difficult
