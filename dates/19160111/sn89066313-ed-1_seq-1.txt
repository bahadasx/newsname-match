Bargain sales In the retail clothing
I, uiness liurt the regular business,
lost money for the merchant, destroy
confidence of the people in the prices
of uoods in regular seasons, and do
no ennd except to give the store a
cei ain amount of publicity and satisfy
a popular demand for bargains. This
view was brought out by I. A. Harth
of the Victor Ilarth Clothing Company,
in a paper read before the Itetail
Mi rchants' Association last night.
"When are you going to put on your
ni xt sale? I think 1 will wait until
the sale to buy my suit. The sale
price is really what the article is
worth." This, said Mr. Ilarth, ex
presses the attitude that some people
have toward a merchant's annual or
semi-annual attempt to rid bis sto( It
of slow-moving goods.
"I am in favor of combining with
other merchants in marking goods at
a lit'le lower price with the under
standing that there will be no sales,"
be said. "We have sales, but the
people naturally pick over the best
bargains and not 10 per cent of the
bad stock moves.
"Tlie method of presentation of
sales in large, misleading ads is il
legitimate. Missouri has a pure ad
vcrtising law that prohibts misrepre
sentation of goods. There is some
thing wrong with advertising which
announces a ?23 garment for sale at i
$." or $7. Let's have clean advertising,
of goods and no sales."

up our own home town rather than
Illinois towns from which we now get
over three-fourths of our coal."

POSTAL RECEIPTS SHOW (JAIN
athletic record by tin
eleven las-t (all.
In the first half not a Pikeway tos
ser located tlie basket from tlie field.
Nine Missouri fouls netted them live
points through Captain Berry's free
(hiows. In the second period .Miller
threw four goals, Busick another and
Berry one from the field and four from
free tries. This was the limit of the
Washington scoiing ability.
Missouri showed the better team
work, but was extremely poor at the
s.'ial shooting game, taking ten shots
at the basket to the Pikers' one, but
making few of the attempts. The Ti
ger guarding was good for early sea
on work. Washington lacked both
team work and goal shooting ability,
and the dribbling was as good as the
goal shooting.
Will in ins Scores fur Tigers.
ilhams, the Tiger center, found
the basket eight times for the Mis
sourians. Campbell, who replaced
Hyde in the second period, threw the
bullet for ten points, and Shirkey was
successful in three of his attempts.
Captain Wear got away badly at the
start in the free-throwing game, but
made eight during the contest and
added four points by field goals.
Twenty-nine fouls were called by
Referee Lampke. siteen on tlie Tigers
mil thirteen on tlie visitors. Moll,
the Piker center, was removed from
'be game for personal fouls. Wear
was successful in halfhis free throw
attempts, and Berry accepted nine of
the thirteen chance offered him. The
Tigers used only one substitute, xvliile
three were sent in for Washington.
The Tigers' team work pleased the
Missouri rooters. Although the play
ing was not so perfect as that of at
least two teams in the Valley race
last year, the first games show up only
the rough points and the coaches can
polish up the defects before the real
fights of the season are staged. One
of the best indications for Van Gent's
quintet is that when one player is
removed from the game there is anoth
er just as good to replace him.
Crowd Reaches l.tiOO JlarK.
Sixteen hundred found seats and
standing room in Rothwell Gymna
sium last night. The crowd was capa
bly handled by a large corps of ush
ers and ticket takers. The Pikers and

Xmiieroiis Actions Against Drug Con
cerns Are Expected to Follow.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 11.
After ten years of legislatidn and
litigation, the Supreme Court decided
jesterday that Congress had enacted
finally a constitutional law regulat
ing statements as to the curative ef
fects of medicines in interstate com
merce. The decision was rendered by
Justice Hughes. Numerous actions
against drug concerns are expected to
follow.
The Government's antitrust suit,
begun before the war in the New York
Federal courts, against European
steamship lines engaged in carrying
steerage passengers, was dismissed by
the court on the ground that the al
leged general pool agreement had be
come "void of actualities" by the war.
The power of cities to enact ordi
nances against the emission of
smoke to a certain degree of density
for a certain length of time was up
held by the court in pronouncing
valid the Dea Moines, la., smoke ordi
nance, attacked by a laundry In that
city.
