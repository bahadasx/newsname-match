threat to shoot him if ne did not re
turn to save the swtmmers. Two
persons, one wounded, were fount
aboard the Portosaid. They were
taken aboard the submarine, bana
aged and transferred to the captain's
boat. While she was still aiding in
the rescue, torpedo-boats and yachts
shelled the submarine, which dived
and escaped. On December 17 Lon
