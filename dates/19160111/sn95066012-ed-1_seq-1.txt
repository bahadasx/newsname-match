WON'T SUPPORT PEACT10NARY
Progressive Convention Likely to Be
Held in Chicaga at Same Time as
Republican Gathering.
Chicago, Jan. 10 lloldinn oplion
on Sun Chicago hotel rooms, the Flor
entine room at the C'on.mvss. the
Auditorium theatre aud Orchestra
hall, to be used if taken the same
week as -the Republican national con
vention in June, friends of Colonel
RooFevelt, headed by George YV.
Perkins, flocked to Chicago today
from all purts ot' the country.
Most of them come as members of
the 1'rosressive national committee
which meets tomorrow to prepare the
call for the Moose convention.
If tho committee tomorrow fixes
the same date as the republican con
clave for their convention, which was
considered a foregone conclusion to
ni(t!it, then the options will be closed
amr the contracts signed for several
headquarters.
A lurther Kisniiicance in the stab
bing of the headquarters was the of
ficial announcement that Colonel
Roosevelt would hold himself in readi
ness to come to Chicago at the time
cf the two (onventions'.' He is Roins;
to l he West Indies where .Mrs Roose
velt ticks recuperation after her i!l
nr.ss. but. lie will be bac'J in llie I'nit-
nl States in ample time to take the
limited train for Chicago if his friends
desire his presence, fi'ational com
mitteemen from most of the states
conhriPed the early gosnip that an
amalgamation at the- Pn-sreksivew
and Republicans is possible next
June, even if Colonel Roosevelt is not
nominated. Hut all agreed that the
ritiimi i iliiiir of the republican con-
c!;!e lor the Colonel would cud the
defection and make everybody hilari
ously happy. '
Perkins, acting chairman of the na-
tiuial ' coannittve, was somewhat
guarded in his slatenients. All he
would .say was that the Progressives
will have a national convention and
name a ticket. The personnel of that
ticket, however, it is known, will be
thp same as the republican ticket it
the nominees are not too 'reaction
ary."

British Force There Affairs Defeat
ed M U Clashed
TURKS HAVE' IMMENSE ARMY
Have Surrounded British Garrison at
Kut-el-Amara But Relief Column
Is Nearing the City,
London, Jan. 11 A disaster for the
British in Mesopotamia is indicated
in reports from German and Turkish
sources. It is said ythal part of the
British army at Kut?-el-Amaru, wher"
It has been staying since Ihe collapt
of llie attempt to reach Bagdad, Is
surrounded by Turks and that the
lest is iu retreat. 1
The British claim contradicts this,
apparently, it being, officially stated
that the Turks are retreating.
A dispatch from Berlin sent yester
day by wireless to Fayville says:
"The British array at Kut-el-Amara.
in Mesopotamia, has now been sur
rounded completely by the Turks, ac
cording to Constantinople advices
given cut today by the Overseas
News Agency. It is paid that the
Turks have advance .1 to the main de
fenses of the British. The main Brit
ish army in Mesopotamia, nccordint;
to uie.-.e advices, is in retreat. 10,000
men having been left in Kut-cI Amara
to cover tho movement."
A Gei man official wireless' dispatch,
dated at Constantinople, received at
London yesterday, makes the claim
that Kut el-Ainura has been surround
ed by the Turks and adds: "It is
hoped that the fort will soon either
ha taken or fall for want, of food
stuffs and that the British defenders.
who number more t'rnn 10,000 will be
raid tired. The B-. hth!.i - thought by
leaving these forces in Kul-el-Amura
to guarantee tho defense of the town
and also to assure the orderly retreat
of the remainder of tiie army. This
portion of the army is at present a
long way southeast of Kut-el-Anmra
and cannot go to the help of the fort,
especially as the mor:.!e of tills force
is shaken."
The Turks in Mcso.uoti'.miit were in
full retreat on Sunday wilh the Brit
ish pursuing them, it was announced
in the House of Com mens at London
yesterday by J. Austen Chamberlain,
ecretary for India. There had been
heavy fighting on both bunks of the
Tigris on January 7 .Mr. Chamber-,
Iain's announcement states, and the
British had taken two Turkish guns
and 700 prisoners.
Recent dispatches have indicated
that the British expedition in Meso
potamia, was confronted by Turkish
forces of superior si-e and that it
would h:'.ve dilliculty in maintaining
its. K at Kut-el-Amara. The defenser.
of llie city, in fact, were ut ticked by
the Turk? seme time ago, resulting in
severe lighting, but ihe British were
able to repulse the assaults.
The retie.it from Kut-el-Amara
issuiiiing the correctness oi the,- tin-
ollin'al advices: from Berlin annarent
U'cans the abandonment by the
British of any attempt, for the pres
ent at least, of an offensive campaign
in .Mesopotamia. It was in Novem
ber of 1 :1 H that au Anglo-Indian
force, starting from the Perisian gulf.
icgan marching north aud west over
the desert following tho Tigris and
Kuphrates rivers wherever possible.
The fighting was slow and exhausting,
but Hie British pushed northward
stc.ulily until in September of Rij"),
they reached Kut-el-Anmra. which is
2:50 miles northwest of the head of
the Persian gull'. They defeated the
furlis there and advanced to Ctcsi-
lion, IS miles below Bagdad. The
I'urks sent up large forces lo save
Bagdad and after an initial defeat.
again attacked and won a victory
over the invaders. The British fell
ck on Kut-el-Amaru, but there has
:een no previous intimation that Ihey
intended to aba mien this point..
Although the Berlin report of Hie
British retreat in .Mesopotamia ap
pears to be at variance with the lit i
tisli announcement that the Turks
are Ruling Hack arter Heavy fighting.
Mr. Chamberlain's statement to the
House of Commons doers not disclose
the point at which the engagement re
ferred to occurred. It is possible that
this action took place somewhere
south of Kut-el-Amara between the
Turks and the main body of the Brit
ish. Locusts.
Indians call locusts "little horses,"
mid the German term for these pests
is "Iiay horses."

the bluest likes. Ihe longest rivers,

Habits of the Wildcat.
To sav that a dog can "whip bis
weight in wildcats" is lo pay about the
highest tribute lo bis strength, cour
age und activity, and there are very
frw dogs that would care to earn such
n tribute if they understood nil It im
plied. Not that a wildcat is of a spe
cially aggressive disposition. On the
contrary, he would sooner nilnil his
own business any time than light. So
anxious is he as a rule to keep out
of trouble that, he bus often been ac
cused of cowardice, but he has on so
ninny occasions given evidence of the
most desperate courage that it is
doubtful if the accusation Is a fair
one. When wounded or nt bay he is
perhaps us dangerous as any creature
of his size.

GORE- WANTS AN EMBARGO
Against Any Nation That Interferes
With Neutral Commerce of the
United States.
Washington, Jan. 10 In a vigor
ous speech today advocating on em
bargo on the shipment of arnin and
ammunition to the European bellig
erents, Representative "Horsey 'W.
Shackleiord of Missouri, one of the
Democratic leaders of the House, a
former memler of the Ways aud
Means committee, said the United
States -was being made the base of
operations from which the belliger
ents assaulted one another.
Mr. Shacklefcrd's speech was in re
ply to anti-embargo arguments of
Representative Gardner of Masschu
jeetti?. "The United States is today the
base of operations hy which one bel
ligerent is carrying on warfare
against another," said Mr. Shackle
ford, " and that in the face cf a
statute which says that our shores
shall net become the base of opera
tions for any belligerent in a war to
which we are not a party.

Company was $122 a share, and in
