AUSTRIAN SUBMARINE DID IT.
Identity of Vessel Which /Sank Liner
Porto Said Established.
Berlin, Jan. 11.—a statement given
out today by the semi-official Over

that It was an Austrian submarine
which sank the Italian liner Porto Said
In the Mediterranean last month, caus
ing the death of six passengers and one
member of the crew. It is asserted the
steamship attempted to ram the sub
marine.
[The Porto Said was torpedoed in the
Mediterranean by a submarine, the
nationality of which was not estab
lished, altho it was said to have flown
the Austrian colors. A dispatch from
Milan on Dec. 27, said an Italian de
stroyer pursued the submarine, which
escaped, altho it was believed to have
been struck by a shell.]

Washington, Jan. 11. Plans to

of establishing a continental army as
contemplated by the war department,
were proposed to President Wilson to
day by Chairman Hay, of the house

Under Mr. Hay's plan the national

first tbls plan would bring only

he felt sure that within two years
there would be 400,000,
The, plan also proposed to increase
the present regular regiments of in
fantry to war strength instead of add

that would give the same increase to

overhead charges.
A tentative bill, drawn up by Mr.
Hay, now includes the continental
army feature.
