"David A. Sullivan, former Presi

Is not tho only prisoner supposed to

was permitted to go ut largo nml un

Sullivan was permitted to go freo
without guard or attendant In Yon

whero, although all tho tlmo ho was
supposed to be confined under his
sentence.
"It will be recalled how one night
Sullivan went up to a polios officer
In the city of Yonkers and asked him
If he had seen a guard or the Wardan
from tho prison. Sullivan at that
tlmo was alone and evidently could
not find his 'keepor' and was wultlng
for him to be taken back to Sing

MARCH AGAINST THE TURKS
IN ot bince biegfe of
British Army Been in Such Dan
ger as That of the One Now
Shut Up at Kut-El-Amara.
FEAR THAT HUNGER MAY -CAUSE
IT TO SURRENDER
LONDON, Jan. 11. The British force in Mesopotamia under Gen.
Aylmer, proceeding up the Hurts to the relief of Kut-El-Amara, is still ,
halted at Sheik Saad, some 20 miles from KuUil-Amara, according to
the hlest advices received by the Government. The halt is. due to
weather conditions and the necessity of removing the wounded by river.
This announcement was made in the House of Commons this after
noon by J. Austen Chamberlain, Secretary for India.
Hriti?h cavalry forces have located the Turks six miles to the east
ward of Lul-lil-Amani, Mr. Chamberlain added. This Is (he position
trom which the Turks were originally driven by Gen. Townshend In ttw
Battle of Kut-El-Amara.
Whether the force jliut tip hi the besieged town is 10,000 or 40,000
is a matter of doubt. Turkish reports yesterday said 10,000 men had
been cut off. London fears that Gen. Townshcnd's entire army of
10,000 is in Kut-el-Amara, surrounded by a force of Ttuks that far out
numbers them. There is fear also that these troops may be forced by
hunger to surrender' before the relieving army can reach them.
The army of relief must fight its way eastward through a Turkish
force believed to outnumber it two to one. No news of the fate of the
Kut-el-Amara garrison has reached London since tlic arrival of official
despatches covering Saturday mgnt's

For thst reason news ot tho program

Though details are almost com
