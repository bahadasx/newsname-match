Change of Date for Fiscal Year

LICENSE MONEY TO TUNE
OF $50,000 MAY BE SHY
Probable That None of Fat
Fund Can Be Used Before
Jury 1; Deficit of $131,000
May Be Faced on June 30
By a ruse yesterday In the setting
of a flscal year, the supervisor in
caucus tried to ease a burden from
their shoulders and give themselves
sir months more of grace in which to
dry their feet, so to speak, from the
deep -vadlng in the city funds they
Lave been doing since taking office.;
But did they, when they voted to
place the fiscal year upon a. new basis
from July to July Instead of from
January to December as formerly the
custom, really benefit themselves as
much as appeared at the monlent?
That they did not really bring about
a lasting benefit and that they may
yet withdraw from the idea and not
pass the resolution on its final read
ing was the feeling expressed from va
rious parts of the city hall today.
Figures for End of June.
Figures prepared by the auditor's
department seem to 6how that when
next June rolls around the seven city
fathers will not be In a much better
condition so far as deficits go. than
they are at the present time. The fig
ures are as follows:
Taxes from the territory, half
year ..... i ... 1202.000
Poll and dog taxes . , . ;.;.'. 20,000
Receipts, as fines and costs... 45,000
: Total recelpta $267,000

Still to pay ...............$100,000
; Difference between receipts
and the4resenUleflc1t 1G7.000
Bill of appropriations 298,480
This leaves, after paying as much
of the appropriation bill as possible, a
difference between $298,480 and $167,
000 ot $131,490, or a deficit In June
of practically as much as tne uoaru
faced in December.

be changed without trouble, and that
there Is nothing standing m tne wa
nf th chance leeallv. other officials
in the city hall are of the opinion that
the step was not a wise one, ana tnai
th hoard should rather have faced
the music as It came than to seek to
. protect themselves by the change.
- Attompv General I. M. Stainback
would not venture an opinion in the
i question this morning, as he had not
given it any consideration, and said
that h would want to consider It well
before saying anything for or against
the proposition.

Fortune Falls On
Man Yho Vas Last
Here As Stowaway
On November 4, last year, the Star
Bulletin printed the story that W. G.
Decker, American businessman, was a
stowaway on the Oceanic liner So
noma, working his way from Australia
to San Francisco. He was penniless,
having "gone busted in the colonies,
largely because of anti-American sen
timent there. He had left his wife In
Australia, to follow him when he
could get to the states, save up some
money; and sead it to her.
' The sequel and It is a happy one
came In a letter to the Star-Bulletin
today from Decker, written on the sta
tionery of the Palace Hotel, San Fran
cisco. The erstwhile stowaway writes:
"It might interest you to know that
the stowaway that arrived on the So
noma in November struck it lucky in
San Francisco. I inherited $75,000
and have sent for my wife. Mrs.
Decker will arrivi on the Niagara
'from Sydney January 7 and stop at
the Alexander Yomg until January 12,
then leaving on tl j Matsonla for San
Francisco.
Inquiry at the Young established the
fact that Mrs. IXctfer had been ex
pected there but du not arrive on the
Niagara. It is presumed she will
come on the next steamer.

Sheriff Says Grand Jury Re
port Does Not Ruffle Him;
Contains Eerrors of Fact
"I am willing to take full responsi
bility for the conduct of the city jail.
Long ago I ordered Jailer Fern to put
Into effect strict rules, and those -vis
ttors who enter the jail now must ap
ply to me." ..
This was one of the statements
made by Sheriff Charles H. Rose when
asked his opinion of the report ot the
grand jury as published yesterday in
the Star-Bulletin. Rose qualified his
words in this way:
"To compare my administration of
the city jail with that of High Sheriff
Jarre tt in Oahu prison is unfair. I
have to give my time to running a
police force and he has only to attend
tc his prison affairs. But the city jail
is being run in an efficient manner,
mevertheless.
The report of the grand Jury,
Rose continued, "Is just the same as
their short report at the time of the
Investigation Into Fred Gough's story
of misconduct at the jail, except that
it shifts responsibility to me. It charg
es . carelessness, which, if It ever ex
isted, has been overcome since the
grand jury recommended more care
In the first report
Rose Is Satisfied.
"I am satisfied with this report It
does not bear out the charges which
have been made in newspapers here
of gross Incompetence and misconduct
it does charge carelessness, which I
do not agree ever existed in any great
degree. .
"The grand Jury report says 'visitors
6hould not be permitted to go to the jail
without a pass as has been the prac
tise and Is now the practise.
This is an error. Weeks ago I
made a rule that no one could euter
the jail without a pass from my office.
The report also says no reports are
made to me from the Jail. I announc
ed in an Interview weeks ago that
such reports were now required." !
Asked w hether he had anv eeneraJ
objection to the report. Rose said:
rsone whatever. The lurv Droh-
ably judged by the facts as presented
to them. We know the police depart
ment is not perfect "jut wc think it
is better than it has ever been.
Newspapers have exaggerated the
viewpoint of the grand jury by read
ing Into the report things that are not
there." Rose concluded. "The rpasnn
for this is politics. Not being of the
party represented by the newspapers.
1 naturally do not expect any great
amount of praise from them. I am
well satisfied if I get a fair deal. Ev-
ery sheriff In office here for years has
had the same thing that I am getting
a lot of criticism: And I guess I
can stand it if they could."

Points to New Jersey Idea;

Recommending a filtration plant for
Nuuanu and buggesting the possibility
of charging undeveloped property for
water-mains laid along the front, the
territorial grand jury's report for 1915
takes up the water and 6ewer prob
lems in a vigorous manner.
This part of the long report made
yesterday is of much general interest
in view of the present discussion over
waterworks development. The grand
jury proposes bond issues for water
and sewer system extensions, but only
after comprehensive plans and studies
have been made. ;
The report upon these subjects is as
follows: '
"In the case of Honolulu, where 90
per cent of the privileges are flat
rates, a frequent inspection of all fix
tures should be made in order to keep
the waste and leakage reduced to &
minimum. Water closets will get put
of order; urinals will become opened
too full, and rigid rules to conserve
the supply, and a rigid enforcement of
such rules are imperative against
those who wilfully abuse the flat-rate
privilege.
"Wherever such conditions of waste
fulness prevail, the department should
very promptly enforce meterage or
shut off the supply. Indeed, meter
age to begin with is the only fair or
equitable way to sell water; and as
we approach the entirely metered sys

Two Are in Orient
"Mr. Timberlake has come here to
assist our experimental force," said
Hamilton P. Agee, director of the ex
periment station, this morning. "We
are. short on entomologists, as two of
our men, H. T. Osborn. assistant en
tomologist, and Frederick W. Muir,
associate entomologist are now in the
Orient searching for sugar beetle
parasites. Mr. Osborn is in the Phil

On the return of Messrs. Muir and
Osborn with their parasites, they will

Swezey, head of the entomolog' de

periments with parasites deadly to th
anomala beetle, the Japanese beetle
and other pests.
The anomala beetle itself does not
injure the cane roots, but its larvae
do. as the eggs are laid in the roots
and the larvae feed on them. The
Japanese beetle, when full grown, also
attacks the cane. .
