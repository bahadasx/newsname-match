Quiet on Russian Front.
London, Jan. 11. While the Rus-
I sian front has been quiet during the
j last twenty-four hours there lias been
J severe lighting in the other war tliea-
tres.
j On the Montenegrin front, the Aus
jlrians have been generally successful.
They have advanced tiieir positions
at several important points despite
I lie handicap of snow waist deep and
are showing themselves just as adept
as the Montenegrins in mountain light
ing, which heretofore has been re
garded as the particular specialty of
the Montenegrin soldiers.
After the Germans had taken about
700 yards of French trenches in
Champagne in an offensive launched
with large numbers of men with the
intention of obtaining important re
sults, the French troops, according
to Paris, stopped the attack short and
in vicious counter attacks reoccupied
j successively nearly all the terrain
i lost. In addition, on the heights of
the Meuse, a heavy French bombard
ment did great damage to the German
trenches.
The situation in Mesopotamia,
where the Turks and British are en-
' gaged along the Tigris river, is still
! not clear owing to the divergent re
ports of Constantinople and London.
While the British say that the Turks
around Kut-El-Amara are in retreat,
a Turkish communication declares
that it is the British who are falling
back and that a force of ln.OOO Brit
ish left in Kut-El-Amara is sur
rounded. Along the Austro-Italian front the
usual bombardments are in progress.
A squadron of French aeroplanes has
dropped bombs on Sofia, the cnpitol of
Bulgaria.
Petrograd says the calm on the
Czernowitz front is due to the huge
losses and resulting demoralisation of
the Austro-IIungarian army. That
there is some basis for this statement
is evident from the estimate of the
Hungarian newspaper, pc"T i.ioyn,
that the losses on both sides '.t the
Kessarabian battles so far exceed
17,-,100, or more than ttie total Mu
lsh losses in the whole Dardanelles
campaign.
Another Hungarian newspaper
states on the authority of t staff re
port that the fighting on this front
has been the bitterest and bloodiest
In the history of the war, both sides
sacrificing men in a manni r without
parallel.
The Saloniki front is chiefly no
table in the day's dispatches as the
scene of almost continued aeroplane
skirmishes. The Germans have thus
far lost six aeroplanes In this region.
Several lengthy dispatches have
been received here giving details of
the recent operations in eastern Ga
licia, which were so meagerly de
scribed in the official reports. Ac
cording to these dispatches the Rus
sians, after artillery preparation
which showed there was no longer
any shortage In their big gun ammu
nition, started an offensive which
caused the Austro-Germans to rush
every available division to Galicia.
Czernowltz is still In the posses
sion of the Austrans and is filled
with wounded. But the Russians ap
parently are directing their main at
tack against Sadagora, north pf the
Bukowina capital, where five import
ant roads converge.

MINUTES RECENTLY.
John Douglass, head of the local
claim department of the Santa Fe,
now at work in this city, is a mighty
hunter, as recent exploits will bear
testimony. On a recent deer hunting
expedition in southwest Texas, where
in less than three minutes after sight
ing a flock, he had the limit of three
big bucks stretched out on the sward
as rapidly as his Winchester could
bark.
Mr. Douglass states that deer are
very plentiful down in that section of
the state, and every member of the
party got ail that was coming to them.
He spends part of the hunting season
there every year and states that with
proper protection It ought to remain a

MOVEMENT ON FOOT TO HAVE
THEM LOCATE PLANT AT OIL
MILL IN THIS CITY GROW
ERS BELIEVE THEY WILL.
Walter Colbert stated this morning
that a movement is on foot here at
present to induce the Ardmore Oil
& Milling company to install machin
ery for a peanut factory, and that
they would probably do so, as soon
as a report is received from the mill
at Burant, where one is in operation
in connection with the oil company.
The milling company would have
the advantage of others In Installing
such a plant inasmuch as they have
the power and the room already at
their command, and Mr. Colbert esti
mates that an outlay of four thousand
dollars would Install all necessary
machinery to handle all the peanuts
raised in this locality for some time.
The acreage will be materially In
creased this year In the face of the
fact that last year much of the crop
was lost on account of not havir.e
a factory to handle them, hut .ir.
Colbert Ftated that In the event the
milling company does not in.-tall the
plant, he had already made plans tn?

Yesterday afternoon Governor Doug

Willis of Kingston, Dr. T. P. Howell
of Davis, Waller Colbert or this city,
and several other prominent Indians
met at the Itandol Hotel for the pur
pose of discussing the advisability of

it the recent treaty rights meeting in
this city to Washington at this time, to
look after the per capita payment due

oilier affairs that might be advisalile.
At the recent meeting, Dr. T. P.
Howell of Davis and Walter Colbert
of this city were chosen delegates to
Washington, but on account of press
ing personal business, Mr. Colbert
stated this morning that It would be
impossible for him to go at this time.
Dr. Howell will leave, however, with

Colbert stated that he has convinced
the majority of them that a mill will
be erected, and they, together with
many new converts of the peanut
industry, will make the ncreago heavy

Some time a??o, parties from Arkan
sas were here investigating condi
tions with a view to establishing a
plant, but nothing has been heard
from them and a careful inquiry at
places where they said they wero well
known failed (o produce such infor
mation as would lend much confidence
to local growers who want a factory.
For that reason, Mr. Colbert nnd sev
eral others who are anxious to see
peanuts supplant In a large measure
the cotton crop of this section, took
the matter up with the oil milling
people, with every prospect that they
will succeed In having them locate a
plant here to handle the Incoming
crop. Mr. Colbert stated Ibis morn

acres and that he knows several oth
er farmers who will have that much
acreage, or more.

Joplin. Mo., Jan. 11. The four men
alleged to be connected with the anti-

section of the United States penal
cade prohibiting "the deposit, or caus
ing to bo deposited, for mailing or

hook, letter, writing, print or other
publication of 'Indecent character."
Six counts in the Indictments were
