Confession Of Two Ausfrians In Jail
At East Youngstown
Inquisition By
Federal
lakes Sensational Turn
Youngstown, O., Jan. 10. The In
quisition by botlu federal nnd Mahon
ing county authorities Into mob vio
lence at the plant of tho Youngstown
Sheet and Tube company last Friday
night, when two persons were killed,
many wounded nnd $1,000,000 worth
of property destroyed, took a sensa
tional turn when County Detective
Kane snid two Austrians In the coun
ty jail here have made confessions In
Which they nro quoted as saying they
were sent here from Now York to
start tho strike, co as to prevent the
manufacture of war munitions for the
allies. The men are Dan Fleck and
John Brlsky.
"It would be useless for us to at
tempt to operate our plant while some
of tho workers are in their' present
frame of mind." J. A. Campbell, presi
dent of the Youngstown Sheet and
Tube company, said, discussing strike
conditions. "We do not need any pro
tection for ourselveB, but we want to
have our workers and their homes
protected. Brigadier General Speaks
has Informed us that he will remove
tho national guardsmen from our
plant. It was never Intended that
they should be quartered there. We
will not Import strikebreakers. I am
confident that outside Influences were
responsible for the shooting. We
have been making war munitions,, and
when we started many of tho" Aus
trans in our ampler refused" to work.
They may havo seized tho opportunity
of assisting lnr this, trouble by Incit
ing the othpr men."
Over 400 persons were taken Into
custody In East ' Youngstown by sol
diers and deputy sheriffs, and the of
ficials are In a quandary as to where
the prisoners are to be kept. Officers
placed prisoners In the flro engine
house, where tlioy were herded like
cattle. Soldiers with fixed bayonets
were stationed putslde the municipal
building to chock any attempt at Jail
delivery.

SUBMARINE ISSUE
TO BE SETTLED SOON
Teutons to tap Within Bound
of International Law.
Washington, Jan. 10. Convinced of
tho good faith of both Germany and
Austria In their willingness to keep
their submarine warfare within tho
bounds of International law, state de
partment officials ' expressed confi
dence that within a reasonably short
time Germany will make tho final
move necessary for a complete settle
ment of tho Lusltauia Issue.
This settlement Is expected to cm
brace what the United States can. ac
cept as disavowal of the attack on
tho Cunard liner, as well as an agree
ment for tho payment of a money In
demnity for the 110 American lives
lost when the vessel was sunk.
The state department Is still lack
ing evidence necessary to prove that
the British liner Persia was attacked
by a submarine and is now awaiting
the outcome of the official inquiries
which the German and Austrian gov
ernments are making of their subma
rine commanders in the Mediterra
nean. Unless these investigations
show that a German or Austrian sub
marine was responsible, the American
government will be compelled to give
up any further attempt to seek satis-
faction in this case.
With tly submarine controversy
woll on the way to amicable adjust
ment, as American officials see it, the
state department may now proceed
to tako up aggressively tho various
grievances which tho United States
holds agalnbt Great Britain and her
allies for what is regarded by this
country as unwarranted interference
with American trade.

MANY DEMOCRATS AGAINST IT
Administration Leaders of the Opin
ion That a Strong Public Campaign
Must Be Undertaken to Save the
Measure From Defeat Republican
Support Needed to Push the Bill
Through the House.
Washington, Jan. 10. Persons who
expect that the appropriations for a
larger navy and greater army are to
bo carried through easily on the wave
of sentiment caused by the European
war aro headed toward a disappoint
ment The president and his advisers
are now alive to the fact that it will
require all the power of the adminis
tration, supplemented by Republican
tupport, to push the preparedness pro
gram through, and there is grave dan-1
ger of failure in regard to the army
oven then. Foreign complications
involving the United States have
tended to obscure the development?
in the preparedness issue, but admin
istration leaders have decided now
that a strong public campaign must
be undertaken and no time lost In
combatting the attacks that are being
made on the president's program.
This congress came into being on
Dec. C, yet no progress has been made
I on tl)e defense bills. Also no consid
eration has been given to measures
to raise revenues to defray the cost
of army and navy expansion that the
president insists is imperative.
It is rather significant that all
speeches on the subject of defense de
livered thus far this session by house
Democrats have been harshly critical
of the president's program. Signific
ance also is attached to the fact that
up to date no administration leader in
house or senate has taken the pains
to make a speech in support of the
program or to reply to the party crit
ics who have assailed it.
It is now known by everybody In
the house, where defense bills are to
te originated, that the president will
have to depend on Republican votes
to put his program through that body.
Prediction is made that approximate
ly sixty Democrats will desert the ad
ministration on this proposition. As
the Democrats now only have a ma
jority of twenty-five in the house it
will thus be seen that the administra
tion would be compelled to steer a
course that will assure the support of
a considerable number of Republicans..
The Democratic opponents of the
defense bills have been active and
alert from the beginning o! the ses
sion, whereas the supposed supnoit
ers of ths administration's program
have been singularly passive and dif
fident. In Its endeavors to push the de
fense bills through congress, the ad
ministration Is undoubtedly handi
capped by the attitude of the respon
sible Democratic leaders In the two
houses. Mr. Kltchln Is an out and
out opponent of preparedness as advo
cated by the president, while Senator
Kern, the senate lender, Is a critic of
the policy and will lind no help to
the administration ..i this emergency.
There Is good reason to believe
that a conference will be held at the
White House in the near future to
pdvise wavs and means to put the
defense bills through the house as ex
peditiously as possible.
STRIKES A MINE,
British Battleship Blown Up, but the
Crew Is Saved.
London. Jan. 10. The British bat

TURKEY REPORTS A DISASTER:
Campaign Against the Dardanelles In
Which 150,000 Allied Soldiers Fell
Formally Abandoned by the Allies
Plans For Attack On Salonica Be
ing Hastened by the Teutons and
Bulgars Germans Score InVosges.
London, Jan. 10. The campaign at
the Dardanelles has been abandoned.
The positions at the tip of the Gal
iipoii peninsula which were retained'
when the British troops left Sula
bay and Anzac cove on Dec. 19 have'
now been evacuated. Xot a British
or French soldier now remains on the
peninsula, where more than 150.00
allied soldiers were killed or wound
ed since April last in futile attempts
to force the Turkish lines.
The evacuation of the last allied
positions was effected, according to
the official announcement, with the
loss of one British boldier wounded,
the French suffering no casualties.
This appears to have been an even
more remarkable exploit than with
drawal from the Suvla bay and Anzac
positions, where the official statement
said the losses Incurred were "Insig
nificant" Renewed activity of various kinds
roted by the Turkish official conimu
.cications in the past few weeks, has
presumably been In the nature of
preparations for the final act of the
Dardanelles tragedy. The Turkish of
ficial report covering the period from,
Thursday to Saturday, records in
creasing effectiveness of the rein
forced Turkish batteries, which have
been drawing in and concentrating on.
the allies' remaining positions.
According to Turkish reports the
TurkB compelled the abandonment or
the allied positions after a violent
battle in which the British suffered
great losses. Reuter's correspondent
at Amsterdam forwards a senii-offichvr
report from Constantinople saying
that the Turks claim the capture of a
great enemy camp and nine guns and
the sinking of an enemy vessel with
tioops..
On the west and east fronts there
have been no reports of large devel
opments. The German communication'
says that the Germans have complet
ed the recapture of positions on Hart
manns Weiler Kopf. taken by the
French a few days before Christinas.
Nearly 2,000 prisoners and fifteen ma
chine guns were taken.
Greek correspondents continue to
assert tlfnt the Bulgarians and Ger
mans are hastening plans for an at
tack on Salonica. But the Austrians
are fiphtlne hard, against the Rus
sians and Montenegrins, and the Bul
gars are largely occupied in a reso
lute attempt to reach the Adriatic,
from which they are only forty mllcs
