LANDINGS ARE DAMAGED
BY REMARKABLY HIGH SEAS
The entire cast end of Kauai
was visited by another Kona wind
with very rotiRli seas on Friday
and Saturday, and quite a little
damage was done in several places.
At Nawiliwili three of the new
concrete piles, put in only a few
months ago by the public works
department, were swept from be
neath the landing. Other piles were
loosened and the foundation of
the wharf generally left in a more
or less dangerous condition. High
rollers swept over the land in the
neighborhood, against and into
the warehouses a n d under the
houses along the beach.
At Ahukini the high seas swept
completely over the landing, carry
ing off everything of a movable
nature. Back of the landing the
water rose high on shore and swept
aside several yards o f railroad
track that was at least eighty feet
above the sea, at normal.
All along the coast in the
neighborhood of Wailua the seas

of Hawaii in the very near future
probably from Wednesday to
Saturday of next week. Brigadier
General Samuel I. Johnson has
written to Major Broadbent about
the matter. He concludes his let
ter as follows:
"I am very glad to be able to
announce that Col. Baldwin and'
Captain Penhallow, regimental j
quartermaster, will accompany me
on the coining trip. The former
will, I think, wish to inspect the
six companies and to meet the offi
cers". Colonel Baldwin, it may be ex
plained for the benefit of those
outside of the Guard, is comman
der of the Third Regiment, of
which the Kauai companies are a
part. He is the plantation man of
Maui.
General Johnson has been m
f )rmed that it will be difficult to
get all the companies together for
battalion maneuvers, so that the
companies will likely be visited on
their own ground and inspected.
tJfhc evening before the visitors
depart they will be given a "blow
out" by the Kauai officers at one
of the hotels.

came farther inshore than had been
witnessed in years, and all of the
settlements were washed out.
At Keolia the breakwater recent
ly erected, extending about 200
feet into the bay, was washed
away, hoisting equipment a n d
other material on the little wharf
going with it. This breakwater
was constructed, possibly, of rock
too small for such purposes, ac
counting for the complete destruc
tion of the improvement.
West of Nawiliwili, the lauding
at George N. Wilcox's beach resi
dence was swept away and will
have to be rebuilt inits entirety.
Although the wind was verv
high throughout the two days, no
damage of consequence on shore is
reported. The actual destruction
of property was confined to the
action of the high waves.
The storm came directly from
the south, and was, apparently, a
section of the kona weather which
has prevailed for several weeks.
NEWS OF DEATH OF
IS. M. CHRIST
News was received on Friday
last of the "death "in Tacoma,
Washington, of Mrs. Margaret
Christ, formerly nurse in Lihue
Hospital from 1902 to 1913, under
the incumbencies of Doctors Watt,'
Wilkinson, and Putnam. She will
be remembered by her friends for
her faithfulness in the discharge
of her duties in the pioneer days
of the hospital when its facilities
weie not as adequate as at present.
Later, the strenuousness of the
work told on her heaith, and she
was forced to give up her work
and leave foi the coast in a vain
attempt to recover her strength.
Her friends feel that had she left
earlier she might have been spared
for many more years of service in
a less difficult position; but it was
very hard for her to tear herself
away from Lihue, which she had
come to look upon as home, and
from i.the many friends she had
made here.
She will be sincerely mourned
by all who knew "her intimately
and who appreciated her sterling
qualities.
