Wilson Clan.
Washington, 'Jan. 11—Senator New
lands of Nevada, democrat, attacked
his party's record in the senate, de
livering a long prepared speech in
which he criticized the tariff, bank
ing reforms and chief legislative
achievements of the Wilson adminis
tration. He declared that because
there has been an Industrial and com
mercial depression contemporaneous
with democratic control of the legis
lation, the party would be in danger
of defeat at the nert presidential
election unless the European war con
tinued, and made the president's "sa
gacious and Arm" handling of foreign
affairs an overshadowing issue.
Defeat Averted by War.
The danger of democratic defeat In
the congressional elections of 1914 he
said "vras averted only by the Euro

contrast. .the ».-• president's policy of

power which adopts radical instead
of evolutionary methods of reform."
with the **d haste of the European i™5
nations as they rushed into w*f and1
which made that policy as popular as ^°'^^_^Mri^m8m jvhich sbAJjlnsi
it had theretofore been unpopular."
"The realization that similar prud
ence would keep up out of European
complications," he added, "saved the
party at the last election from the de
feat which would have surely come
as the result of the general prostra
tion of business popularly attributed
to our economic legislation. It would
not do to charge this to the European
war first, because of the war, though
Injurious to our production and trade
in its inception, has since become a
stimulus to production and export
and second, because the commence
ment of this depression antedates the
European war and was contemporan
eous with our legislation regarding
the tariff, banking and trade.
"We are about to face a united re
publican party, chastened by adversi
ty and eager to persuade and the
question is whether the democratic
party, having done much under the
administration in the interests of gen
uine reform, is again to be thrown out I
of power and deprived of the oppor
tunlty of continued usefulness simply
because an intervening period of de
preset on subjects us again to the
charge of democratic hard times, wjlth
its accompanying loss of votes."
