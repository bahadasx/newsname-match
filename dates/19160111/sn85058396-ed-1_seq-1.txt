COMPULSORY BILL
WILL PASS HOUSE
Irish Nationalists Withdraw
All Opposition to British
Military Service Measure.
STAND BY GOVERNMENT
Large Majority of People of
United Kingdom in Favor
of Proposed. Action.
London, Jan. 1 1 . 1:40 p m John
E. Redmond, parliamentary leader of
Irish party, announced in the house
of commons this afternoon that the
nationalists would not further oppose
the military service bill.
Mr Redmond went direct to parlia
ment from a meeting of the Irish
party. Ho quickly ranged himself and
his followers once more on the side
of the government.
Mr, Redmond said the Irish nation
alists, having their protest against the
military service bill and recognizing
that the measure had the support of
an overwhelming majority of British
representatives in the house would
cast on further vote In any form
against It. Even the opponents of the
bill, he said, admitted it was receiving
the support of a large majority of the
people of the United Kingdom.
Mr. Redmond added that the major
ity in favor of the bill in the vote of
first reading, excluding the Irish
members was 0 to 1. He said the
bill would become, law and ho hopes
It would be passed quickly
Opponents Scathingly Denounced.
Sir Edward Carson scathingly de
nounced the opponents of the bill. Tie
declared that the obligations which
Great Britain had assumed could not
be fulfilled until the bill became law.
The Dardanelles had been abandon
ed he said, because the country had
not had enough men to carry through
the enterprise which Sir Edward char
acterized as "an admirably conceived,
undertaking"
With regard to Serbia Sir Edward
said that the country had expected
much and received but little until U
was too late and the reason was not
unwillingness on the part of the gov
ernment, but the fact that it could not
get men. If these men were not ob
tained, he asked how was the war to
be carried on
"What matters injury to industry or
Industrial compulsion as long as we
win7" said Sir Edward. "What will
anything matter if we lose?"
Conscription of Property.
Referring to suggestions regarding;
tho conscription of property. Sir Ed
ward declared he would not shrink
from It if necessary in this way to
raise funds to win the war.
"What good is property to me." he
said, "If I have to hang my head in
shame?"
lie expressed profound disappoint
ment at the exclusion of Ireland from
the bill as Irishmen are not less con
cerned in the gaining of victory than
is the democracy of England.
"l oeitcvc in my neart, no saiu,
"that when the hour of victory comes,
as certainly il will come, we who are
Irishmen will feel ashamed when we
remember that we expected others to
make sacrifices from which we provid
ed tor our own exclusion."
Commoners Not Exempt.
Even before the debate opened
questions brought the topic of com
pulsory service into prominence The
commoners themselves, if sufficiently
youthful and agile, according to a
reply given by Premier Asquith, can
not claim exemption from service.
They will therefore be compulsorlly
enrolled in tho military service unless
they voluntarily attest.
Augustine Bierrcl, chief secretary
for Ireland, revealed the fact that
there were 400,000 unmarried men of
military age in Ireland who had not
attested. Deductions for various rea
sons, he estimated, would leave 80,000
available men.

ARE DESCRIBED
Sir Edward Grey Sends a Let
ter to the American
Embassador.
London, Jan. 10, 8:59 p. m Sir Ed
ward Grey, secretary of state for for
eign affairs, finds opportunity for
some plain speaking regarding the
Austro-Hungarians' submarine war
fare, in a letter to the American em
bassador, Walter H. Page, replying to
a request from the Austro-Hungarian
government that special pains be
taken to insure the safety of certain
Austro-Hungarian subjects that are
beinEr ronatrin.t.pfl frnin Tnriin. an thf
steamship Golconda.
The request Is embodied in a peti
tion from Austro-Hungarian subjects
which tho Austro-Hungarian govern
ment indorses Sir Edward Grey re
plies. "Some of the requests of the peti
tion have alread)' been conceded as
a matter of course. With regard to
that portion of the petition which
asks that special precautions be tak
en to prevent danger to the lives of
the Golconda's passengers by subma
rine attack, I feel bound to express
my astonishment that the Austro-Hungarian
government, themselves one of
the authors of Uae danger, should havo
thought It seemly to Indorse this re
quest. "Not content, however, with doing
this, the Austro-Hungarian govern
ment further state that they will hold
his majesty's government responsible
for the lives and well being of those
passengers, "a majority of whom are
better-class people."
"I am at a loss to know why better
class people should be thought more
entitled to protection from submarine
attack than other non-combatants.
But, however that may be, the only
danger of the character Indicated
which threatens any passengers on
the Golconda is one for which the
Austro-Hungarian and German gov
ernments alone are responsible. It is
they only who carry on the novel and
inhumane form of warfare which dis
regards all hitherto accepted prin
ciples of international law and nec
essarily endangers the lives of non
combatants. Admit Outrages.
ay asKing special precautions to
protect one of their own subjects on
board a British merchant vessel the
Austro-Hungarian government recog
nizes what is the inevitable conse
quence of their submarine policy, and
admit that the outrages whereby the
Lusltanla, the Persia and numbers of
other ships have been sunk without
warning were not the result of sacual
brutalities of the officers of the en
emy submarines, but part of a settled
and premeditated policy of the govern
ments they serve.
"It Is needless to add that his ma
jesty's government do not propose to
take any precautions in behalf of Austro-Hungarian
subjects which they do
not take on behalf of their own, and
that if they suffer any injurv from
submarine attack on the part of his
majesty's enemies, the responsibility
must rest solely with those who have
made such attacks part of their ordi
nary methods of warofare.
Tho proper and sufficient protec
tion from this danger is that Austria
Hungary and Germany should observe
tho ordinary rules of humanity in
thoir methods of warefare."

"There iB a crying need that we

inoi8t that every man who is within

we must insist that they "have jus

Must Insist on Preparedness.
"We must insist upon the most thorough-going
preparedness to protect
our rights against all possible attacks
by any aggressors. Such prepared
ness is the best guarantee of any
honorable peace.
"AVo must ever remember that
there cannot be such preparedness in
things material unless there is also
that preparedness of soul and spirit
which alone ronders a nation fit to
perform its high and difficult duties
