passage of the government's conscrip
tion bill to tho second reading 'be
came apparently certain tonight with
announcement from John Itedmond,
Irish lender, that IrUn opposition to
compulsion has been withdrawn.
Tho fact that Irelund Is excluded
from operation of tho bill won over
several Irish leaders, and then In con
ference Redmond defeated the min

continuing objection to the proposal.
Though J. Anderson, Independent
laborlte member, moved rejection of
the conscription plan, Labnrlte Will
Thorne was hailed with cheers when
he announced that Anderson was not
representative of the labor party's
position.
Efforts will be made tomorrow in
a conference with labor leaders to
win their support so that the bill may
finally pass as nearly unanimously as
possible, to show Great Britain's ene
mies that she presents a united front

ASSURED
PROSPERITY
BULL KIRS Will
MEETSAfliE DAYAS G.O.P.
Members oi Party Who Favor Amalgamation With the
Republicans Win Victory When Convention Date Is
Fixed As June 7th and the Place As Chicago, Coinci
dent With Meeting ol the Old Organization
Chicago, Jan. 11. Theibull moose
convention will be held In Chicago
June 7, the same day as the repub
lican convention.
Selection of this date stands as a
victory fur tuo in favor of amal
gamation with the republican party
if terms for such combination can
bo arranged.
Chicago, Jan. 11. "Peace with
honor" Is the only kind of peace the
bull moosers will accept from the
O. O. P. If this kind of a peace can
be obtained, three-fourths of the bull
moose national committeemen favor
amalgamation with the mother party.
This was the outstanding feature
today as theibull moose national com
mittee got down to the business of
their gathering here. A national
convention, simultaneous with the re
publican session, appears extremely
likely; and If Colonel Roosevelt, or
a progressive republican, Is nomin
ated by the O. 0. P., the bull moose
party will become a memory. The
only bar to such a situation Is the
bull moose fear that the standpatters
will-control the republican conven
tlon and squash a Roosevelt boom be
fore It can be developed.
Committeemen Lyon and Hotch
kl8s declared that amalgamation pre
sents the only possibility of defeat
ing President Wilson; and they think
that the majority of republicans feel
the same way.
Some line aa to the bull moose at
tack In the event they again get Into
the fight was given last night In a
banquet for the committeemen when
George W. Perkins criticized Presi
dent Wilson's foreign policy and call
ed tt vacillating.
The committee must arrange rep
resentation In the convention based
on the vote Roosevelt received In
the laRt election and It was expected
this would consume several hours,
though such a scheme would be
merely perfunctory If the party de
cided on amalgamation.
A strong minority favored waiting
London, Jan. 11. England may
Insert in final peace terms with Ger
many a clause by which Germany
will bind her own hand In the mat
ter of commercial expansion.
With Great Britain's announced In
tention of striking at the roots of
German trade, It was learned today
that commercial experts have sug
gested that one of the most effective
methods of doing this would be . to
insert a clause In the peace terms
whereby Germany would agree to re
frain from export business for a
period of years.
Leading business men today ap
proved the speech of President Run
ciman of the 'board of trade in which
he announced the war-to-tho-hllt
policy against Gorman trade and
finance. Advocates of cutting oft
Germany's export business declared
that while the British navy as mis
tress of the seas could enforce such
a plan, Germany might "buy her way
out" through heavy indemnities.
Meanwhile, the board of trade la

powers would refuse to buy German
products In the period after the war.

until after the other parties had held
their convention, but Committeeman
Lyon of Texas and western commit
teemen plan to override this faction.
At an open conference of commit
teemen and party leaders, Allen
White precipitated discussion of the
LniaUer of holding a convention sim
ultaneously with the republican meet
ing when he moved that it "be June 7.
Several committeemen, however, shut
oft a vote by saying that the commit
tee Itself should decide.
Committeeman Flynn of Pittsburg
insisted upon open discussion and de
clared himself flatly for amalgama
tion.
"Most of the republicans are pro
gressives, anyway," he safd. "And if
we had affiliated with the republicans
as a party Pennsylvania would not
have been afflicted with Boles Pen
rose as senator. The progressives
should not care what they are label
ed. All we are after la results."
Flynn declared that Roosevelt Is
not the only mat) capable of running
the party or nation, but, he added, he
knew of no one who could do It bet
ter. '.. v;, ,-
A. E. Griffith of Washington state
was ibitter against an amalgamation,
saying: "Our people want the pro
gressive party to live and to continue
as a party." ,
Several others spoke against sim
ultaneous conventions, and finally
Perkins adjourned the conference un
til 3:30 o'clock. The time and place
for the convention was to be decided
then.
From Governor Johnson of Cali
fornia came the following message
today:
"We have every reason to ibe Jubi
lant that the men and the party have
exerted a most wholesome Influence
on the nation's political life."
From Charles Sumner Bird of
Massachusetts the committee had this
word:
Former Senator Beverldge of In

preparedness.

to bid on an enormous scale for neu
tral commerce.
In fact, the commons was told the
English have already grasped trade
opportunities In such commodities as
optical goods, dyes and others in
which Germany was supposed to have
a monopoly. England has been
reaching out her trade hands In a
! bid for a larger slice of South Amer
: lean trade, In view of the destruction
!of the German connections with that
i land caused iby the English blockade.
I The Industries of the empire fair,
J to be held In London in 1917, will
, pay particular attention to English
! products formerly made In Germany,
(and Great Britain will endeavor to
attract to this exposition commission
ers from all lands.
J In addition to artificial means of
Bhuttlng off the German trade, Eng
lish people see a natural ibarrler to
such business in Sir Alfred Mond's
suggestion that after the war Ger-

POPE WILL TAKE
STEPS AT OK
TO
Rome, Jan. 11. Pope Benedict
hopes to take the first practical step
toward peace this week. Cardinal
Mercler of Belgium and Bishop Hey
lan of Namur are expected here and
will be granted an audience with
his holiness, when they will tell him
the terms upon which Belgium will
agree to an early peace.
The pope has been convinced from
the beginning of the great war that
restoration of Bolgium Is an imper
ative preliminary to any peace terms,
and It Is understood that he baa so
notified both sides.
In the recent consistory. Cardinal
Hartmann of Cologne submitted Ger
many's terms for evacuation of
France and Belgium. The pope next
desired to learn the Belgians' views.
and to this end Germany readily con
sented to passage of the prelates to
Rome.
Several members of the Belgian re
lief commission from London are al
ready In Rome and it Is understood
that the Vatican will solicit their
views as to the solution of the Bel
gian problem. After learning the
terms of Belgium, the pope plans to
submit them to Germany, hoping to
begin a series of compromises he be
lieves necessary to peace.
Though Belgium has 'been conquer
ed by invasion, the fact that she has
the backing of the allies places her
In a position at least to formulate
the terms which the pope seeks.
