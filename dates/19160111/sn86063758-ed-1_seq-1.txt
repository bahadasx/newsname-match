CARD OF THA>KS.
We take this method of expressing
our sincere appreciation and thanks to
the many friend of Mr. Theodore Danielsen,
who so kindly ministered to him
and us during his recent illness and
death. Especially do we thank the authorities
of the Newberry cotton mills
for their tribute of respect in closing
down the mills during the passing ot
the funeral party.
We can only express our thanks, but
God alone can repay, and our prayer is
that the God whom he served will restore
unto all these ten-fold for their
many deeds of kindness in our time of
offliction. Wife and Children.
