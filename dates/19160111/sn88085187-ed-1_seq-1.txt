STOP THIS PLUNDER
ji; The four-headed T. R. &P. franchise will come before
f the council tomorrow for final action. It should be killed.
j It is an insidious scheme. It gives the Stone-Webster interests concessions
of great value and the city practically nothing in return. The negotiations
long in progress at the city
hall have been marked
by stealth, deceit, downright
dishonesty and—worse. If
it had not been for the
watchfulness of Mayor
Fawcett and the publicity
given the matter by The
Times, an exceedingly more
dangerous measure long
since would have been passed. But
while the present ordinance is vastly
better than the old from the public's
standpoint, it still remains merely an
exploitation tool for a selfish, non
resident special interest.
In the first place, nobody ever
has advanced either a reason or an
excuse for returning to the com
pany the power franchise which
tke city spent much time, energy
and money IA taking, through the
courts, from the erring corporation.
Neither Bean nor any of his slick
attorneys can point to one benefit
which the city will derive from
the transaction.
Among the good and sufficient
reasons why the franchise sho.uld
NOT be passed are these:
Ilt prohibits the city from
buying current from any
other source for the next 15 jears.

■■ make Is only a flim-flam.
For failure on the company's part to live up to its
terms, certain penalties are enumerated. These may
not exceed $500 a month, or $10,000 a year. NOR
MAY THEY EXCEED WHATEVER SUM THE
GITY PAID FOR CURRENT DURING THE
LAST PRECEDING YEAR IN WHICH CUR
RENT WAS USED. If during 1916 the city uses,
say hot more than $200 worth—which it probably
won't- then in 1917 $200 would constitute the whole
terrible penalty the city would impose should the
company violate every promise it had made!
fit gives the company a fran
chise to extend its Pacific

necessity of even paying any part of the cost of pav

4 It gives the company the
FREE use of the Tacoma Ay«
fill, which cost the city $105,000, when an adherance
to charter provisions would make the company bear
half that cost.
5 It falls to provide at all for
the much-needed Stevens
St. extension. «
6 It levies a tax of only twq
per cent on gross earnings,
where holders of all other franchises, including oth
er T. R. & P. franchises, pay five per cent.
7 It obliges the city to sell
lighting current to T. R. &P.
power patrons at a rate lower than the city can sell
even'to its own patrons.

Sit binds the company to
furnish the city auxiliary
power only in cases of "accident or disability" of
the city plant; it does not require such service at low
water periods, the time of times when the city needs
it.
The company and the coun
cil* it should be said in fairness,
have agreed verbally to cor
rect the last two faults—when
this editorial was being written
this morning the old provis
ions still stood*
It is probable that, under

Edition
recent court rulings, this ordi
nance, like others granting
franchises, cannot be referred
by the people. If it is to be
killed the council must kill it.
Fortunately, Commission
er Woods is up for re-election.
Certainly if he votes for this
pernicious measure it will be
his political finish, and he
should understand that now.
Drake and Atkins ought to
know that there already is an
organized recall movement
forming against them. If they
vote for this ordinance it un
doubtedly will take definite
and aggressive shape.
If they betray Tacoma by
voting for this looting scheme
| they will merit a prompt re
tirement.
Both owe their elec
tion absolutely to an un
derstanding by the vot
ers that they would stand
with the Mayor in oppo
sition to special interest
aggression. Both have
laid themselves open to
grave suspicion by their
recent maneuvers. Both
must be prepared to an
swer for further treach
ery to the people.
The T. R. & P. fran
chise is a plain plunder
scheme of the old-time
style. It Is fundament
ally vicious—vicious in
many respects.
No amount of amend
ing will make it right*
