vember, 1915, the first year under the
Federal Reserve System. The report
today war presented to congress.
Mr. Williams gives a comparative
statement of the condition of the na
tional banks. He shows net resources
Increased in the year 11,743,878.648,

loans and discounts Increased $917,
450,502. Available cash Increased
$862,000,000 and on November 10, 1915
the reporting national banks had ex
cess reserves of $891,000,000. Tables
show the comparative condition of
banks In 1895 and 1915. In September.
1895, there were 3,712 reporting bans
with net deposits of $1,980,300,00, arid
loans and .discounts or $2,059,408,402
while In November, 1915, there were
5,617 reporting banks with net de

POLICY OF DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION
(By Aaaiwlatrd Preaa.)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11. Senator Newlands, of Nevada, a Dem
ocrat, today attacked his party's record in the senate. He crltlzed
the tariff and banking reforms. H e asserted that because of these
has been the industrial and commercial depression, coterminus
with the democratic control of legislation. The party Is In danger
of defeat at the next presidential election unless the European war
is continued. He made the president's "sagacious and firm" hand
ling of foreign affairs the overshadowing Issue. Although he char
acterized the trend of Democratic legislation as commendable, the
senator asserted that the party was too radical. . He believed that
no party can hope to remain in power which adopts radical Instead
of evolutionary methods of reform."
