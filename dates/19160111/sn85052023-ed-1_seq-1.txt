TO BID ON DE
POSITS FRIDAY
New City Council Elects All Officials
For Two Years Except City
Treasurer.
Officials to serve Stanford for the
next two years, with the exception of
the mayor who holds on for a four
year term, were elected by the new
City Council at a meeting last Fri
day night. The only official not chos
en was the City Treasurer, and this
was due to the fad that the Council
has agreed to let the two local banks
bid for the privilege of becoming
the city depository and to let the
bank securing the deposit name the
treasurer. It was decided to hold
another meeting net Friday night,
at which representatives of both the
banks will be asked to come before
the Council, and make open bids for
the city depository, the bank willing
to make the highest bid receiving the
lilum. A salary of $55 a year is paid
the City Treasurer, and of course,
this will figure in the estimates made
by -the financial institutions. Some
discussion was had at the meeting
Friday regarding th advisability of
passing an ordinance abolishing the
salary, of the treasurer, but it was
decided not to do that, as the salary
paid the treasurer would be taken
into consideration by the banks in
their bidding anywar a-.rf each would
bid $50 higher with the salary at
tached to the office, than without it.
Representative citizens of the city
all seem to agree tTiat the proposi
tion of asking for bids from the
banks for the deposit is the only
eminently fair wTay to award the
treasurership and the action of the
council in taking this step is meeting
with much approval.
Other officials were elected by the
council as forecast by the caucus ac
tion several weeks ago and are as
follows:
City Clerk J. D. Wearen.
City Marshal and Tax Collector
B. D. Carter.
City Attorney T. J. Hill, Jr.
City Assessor Fred Garnett.

WOMEN OF SEDENTARY HABITS
Women who get but little exercise
are likely to be troubled with consti
pation and indigestion ant! will find
Chamberlain's Tablets rightly benefi
cial. Not so good as a three or four
mile walk every day, but very much
better than to allow the bowels to
remain in a constipated condition.
They are easy and pleasant to take
and most agreeable in effect. Ob
tainable everywhere.
PAIR OF MULES BRING $500.
Jim Woods Sells Two-Year-Old Team
s For a Record Price.
The record mule sale of the season
in this part of the state, and a rec
ord for probably the whole state, as"
far as any around here have been
able to observe in the papers, was
the sale of a pair of two-year-old
mare mules by James H. Woods, on
the Knob Lick pike, northwest of
Stanford last week. Mr. Woods sold
the hybrids to Wm. T. Robinson, of
Boyle county for a cool $500 for the
pair. They were extra nice ones,
and had to be to bring that figure,
for Mr. Robinson is an experienced
mule man and always knows what he
is doing.
DEMAND FOR MULES FEATURE
Of January Court Day in Stanford
300 Beeves on Market
January court day, Monday, was
not the most active ever held here
from a trading standpoint, but was
just about as good as January court
usually is, after all of the fat cattle
have moved. The demand for good
mules was the outstanding feature of
the day, and the fact was clearly
demonstrated that the long-eared hy
brids have come into their own again.
Several buyers were on hand and the
top figure paid during the day was
very close to seven cents a pound)
Business with the merchants down
town was brisk. Most of the ' busi-f
ness men say that there is plenty o:ff j
money in circulation. They say that
the country people are paying their,.
yearly bills promptly, for the most
part. Tobacco is selling well, mules
are high, hogs and cattle are firm and)

After Taking Pasteur Treatment
Dick Chandler, near Crab Or
chard, returned Sunday from Bow
ling Green where he has been with
his seven-year-old son for the past
three weeks, having the lad treated
for a mad dog bite. The Pasteur
treatment given under the auspices
of the State Board of Health by Dr.

! the little fellow was able to return
with his father in fine shape, and
with not a trace of ill effects from
the bite of the animal. Mr. Chan
dler is greatly pleased with the
treatment given him by the officials

DIES AFTER
LONG ILLNESS
Mrs. W. H. Underwood Passes Away
At Her Home Near Hubble
Buried at Lancaster.
After patiently suffering for many
weary months, the -pirit of Mrs. Ma
ria W. Underwood, wife of W. H.
Underwood, a prominent farmer of
the Hubble section, passed to its re
ward late Saturday afternoon. Sur
rounding her bedside when the end
came were her devoted husband and
loved ones, who had watched so long
and lovingly as her brave nature
made its successful fight against the
ravages of disease. Every medical
attention possible, and everything
that, loving hands could do was done
for the good woman and beloved
mother, but tired nature was unable
to sustain the unequal battle long
er and she went to that reward above
which has so long been her portion.
Mrs. Underwood was 64 years of
age, and before her marriage to Mr.
Underwood was Miss Wilmott, a sis
ter of Jame I. Wilmott and B. F. Wil
mott, prominent farmers of that sec
tion. In addition to her husband,
she is also survived by two daughters
Mrs. Anna Bailey and Mrs. Lillie
Holtzclaw, who were devotion itself
in waiting upon and nursing their
mother during her final illness. For
many years, the deceased had been
an active and faithful member of the
Hubble Christian church, and she
lived always a Godly Christian life,
and was ready and willing to go
when the final summons came.
Funeral services were conducted
at the home Monday morning at 11
o'clock by Rev..F. M. Tinder, of the
Lancaster Christian church, after
which interment followed in the Lan
caster cemetery.
The pallbearers were: active J.
L. Murphy, R. H. Hester, B. W. Giv

ring and Mike Rogers; honorary
George C. Givens, J. P. Bailey, T. J.

McJNTOSH MAKES GOOD.
Former Waynesburg Banker Head of
Hoosier Institution
A Mishewaka, Ind., paper last
week had an interesting sketch of
Stanley Mcintosh, who went from
the cashiership of the Waynesburg
Deposit Bapk, this county, to the
Hoosier state and has made good
with a' vengeance. The paper said:
Stanley Mcintosh, is secretary
treasurer of the 'ilishawaka Trust
& Savings Co. Before coming to
Mishawaka, January last, he was as
sistant cashier of the Indiana State
bank in Indianapolis, and also is
interested in three other banking in
stitutions in that city. He is also
interested in the Aetna Trust and
Savings Co., of Indianapolis. He
came to Mishawaka last January and
was preceded by most excellent rec
ommendations from all his former
employers. In fact, these tributes
to his character, intelligence and
sound knowledge of the banking bu
siness gained him his present posi-
tion.
He was born in Lincoln county,
Kentucky, and was raised within 40
miles of the birthplace of Lincoln
and Jeff Davis born among the blue
grass, pretty women and fast horses,
as he puts it. He is still a young
man, being only 27 years. He
stands six feet three, and weighs 215
pounds, and is of Scotch-Irish de
scent. What is your opinion of In
diana? the interviewer asked.
"The only difference between it
and Kentucky," he replied, "is that
you, in Indiana eat cold bread, while
we Kentuckians eat it hot three
times a day."
The county adjoining that from
which Mr. Mcintosh came, has, he
says, produced over 400 bankers
within the last ten years, and of
this number 60 odd are at present
identified -with Indiana banks.
Mr. Mcintosh was a school teach
er in his earlier days, and for the
past ten years has been in the bank
ing business. His friends speak of
him as a man of sterling character,
a most capable and conservative X-'
banker, and a man who will endearVsC
himself to all classes of the com-,
munity in which he may reside.
THE GIST OF IT.
"Last December I had a very se
vere cold and was nearly down sick
in bed. I bought two bottles of
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy and -ft
was only a very few days until I
was completely restored to health,"
writes O. J. Metcalf , Weatherby, Mo.
If you would know the Talue . of ,tliis
