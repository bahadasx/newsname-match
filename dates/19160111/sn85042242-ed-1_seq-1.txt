Misbranding of Drugs Held to Be
v'a
Violation of Law Enacted
ri- j, in 1906. .'
•Washington, Jan. 10—
After ten
years of legislation and litigation,
the supreme court decided today that
congress had enacted finally a consti­
tutional law regulating statements
as to the curative effects of medi­
cines 111 interstate commerce. The
decision was rendered by Justice
"Hughes. Numerous actions againsi
drug concerns are expected to follow.
For a time it was urged by govern­
ment officials that the W6 pure food
law, designated as misbranded drugs
or medicines, which were accompan­
ied in interstate commerce by know­
ingly false statements about the cur­
ative effects of the compounds. The
supreme court decided, however, that,
the 1906 law applied only to mis­
branding as to the identity or compo­
sition or drugs.
In response to a resulting message
from President Taft, congress in 1912
enacted: the Sherley amendment,
which 'the supreme court held today
struck precisely at misstatements,
oither on the labels or printed circu­
lars accompanying medicines.

SAYS MURDER SCENE
E
Spoke of Getting Rid of His Wife
Two Months Before Act Was
Commited?
STILL HAUNTS HIM
^rowds Pack Court Room in Min
neapolis Hear Gruesome
Story of Murder.
Minneapolis, Jan. 10.—From the
lips of Charles D. Etcheson, the
state's star witness in the murder
trial off Frederick T. Price, a local
businessman, today came one of the
m.pst sensational stories of its kind
in court: annals of the northwest. The
young traveling salesman or Washing­
ton. D. C., repeated in detail the story
he told when arrested on a joint in­
dictment with Price, in which he said
the latter murdered his third wife and
paid Etcheson for his silence.
When court adjourned tonight until
tomorrow afternoon Etcheson had not
completed his story. It was expect­
ed, however, that tne case would
reach the jury before the end of this
week.
Court Room Packed.
In a court room packed to overflow­
ing, its aisles and entrances choked
with people of all walks of life, Etche­
son told how lie and Price took Mary
Fridley Price, member of a wealthy
family, to the East river automobile
road on the night of November 28,
1914, and how Price hurled her from
a cliff and then crushed her head with
a rock. Price, who has acquired the
title or "ironman" listened to the tale
with no show of emotion.
Etcheson said it was two months
before her deatli that Price first told
ing else. First I flatly refused to have
ever they may be, a merry chase."
Talked.of
"From then. Price talked of noth­
ing elce. "First I flatly refused to hav«
a,hand in the matter,'' the witness
continued. "Then lie insisted and re­
ferred to the money I owed him and
how much he would pay me if 1 would
lie his witness.
"On the night of the murder \vr
drove to the cliff and iPrice brought
the car to a stop. He told his wife
that lie must make a slight repair
and asked her to step from the cav
and take the dog with her.
As she backed out upon the run­
ning board. Price seized her ami
gave a horrible push and she wert
over the cliff. iHe threw the dog af­
ter her.
Dragged by Hair.v
"Then came faint cries from be­
low, and Price, beckoning me to fol­
low, hurried to the foot of the cliff.
He grasped bis wife by the hair and
dragged her several feet to make it
pear the fall had been greater.
'(Mrs. Price was still living. Price
looked about him a moment and gath­
ering up a large rook knelt down be­
side her. I turned my back and
closed my eyes. As the thud of the
rock against he head sounded in the
stillness the dog, unhurt by the fall,
whined and ran toward the cliff. In
a few minutes the flickering spark of
life had left the woman.
"We stopped passing automobilists
and gave out the story that Mrs.
'Price fell to her death while chasing
the dog."
Haunted by Scene.
The witness said he was haunted
continually by the scene on the night
of the alleged crime and decided to
tell his story.
More than 2,0*00 people were in a
line stretching from the court room
entrance down two flights of stairs
into the street before court, conven­
ed. Women predominated in tue
court room. Most of those present
brought their Iuncnes and did not
leave their seats during the noon re­
cess.

On the Montenegrin front the
trians have been generally
ful. They have advanced' their pdtt*
tions at several important points, eke
spite the handicaps of snow waist
deep, and are showing themselves
just aB adept at the Montenegrins in
mountain fighting.
In Champagne the French have re­
pulsed four German attacks. The
Germans, however, have retained a
foothold at two places in the French
advanced trenches. In 'Persia Brit­
ish reinforcements on their way to
the relief of Kut-el-Arra have met
Turkish forces which were compelled
to retire after some heavy fighting.
Austrian* Demoralized.
The iPetrograd official communica­
tion says that the pause on the Cser
nowitz front is due to heavy losses
and resulting demoralization of tile
Austro-Hungarian army.
That there is some basis for the
statement is evident from the evi­
dence of the Hungarian newspaper.
Pester Lloyd, that the losses on both.,
sides of the Bessarabian battle,
far, exceeds 175,000, or more than!
the total lE'ritiBh losses in the wholel
Dardanelles campaign.

At Saloniki.
The Saloniki front is chiefly not­
able in today's dispatches, as the
scene of almost continual aeroplane
skirmishes, one of which continued
for two hours. The Germans have
lost six aeroplanes in this region.
iln the L'alkans reports persist that
the Germans are concentrating at
Mlonastir, preparatory to an attack on
Saloniki, but the interest in the Mac­
edonia campaign has become second­
ary to the operations of the Austri­
ans in Montenegro.
Uneasiness in Italy,
The Austro-Hungarian invasion is
causing great uneasiness among the
Entente powers, and especially Italy,
which sees in its success an end to
Italy's dream of dominating the Al­
banian littoral of the Adriatic.
