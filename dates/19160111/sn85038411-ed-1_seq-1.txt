Governor Names Commission I
Following Refusal of Antlira- j

MAKE DEALERS DISGORGE
I
Thomas Martindalc First on
Rodv Appointed to Con
duct the Inquiry
Governor Brumbaugh to-day
promptly followed up (lie refusal of
the State supreme court to grant a
rehearing: in the anthracite coal tax
•ase by naming: a commission to
probe the Increase in prices which
were put on coal under the guise of
State tax.
This movement is the first in the
rampaign to make the operators and
dealers disgorge what they have taken
for a tax which has been declared
unconstitutional.
The court knocked out the act of
1913, which had been upheld here,
and owing to the classification issue
that carried down the act of 1915 as
well.
The operators, however, made no
attempt to make any return of the
money when the tax was overturned
and the auditor general is prepared
to escheat the money. The Governor
recently declared that he intended to
see thai the people got all the protec
tion that the law would give.
The supreme court refused a re
hearing Saturday, but it was only an
nounced to-day. None of the State
officials would discuss the action of
the court, but the Governor lost no
time in acting. He was empowered
l>y the legislative resolution of June
15. 1918, to name a commission of
three to investigate cause of the
advance in prices and selected as the
commission Thomas Martitulale, of
Philadelphia: Ex-Judge Kobert S.
Oawthrop, West Chester, and John
l.angdon. of Huntingdon. All have
accepted and the inquiry will be start
ed in a short time. The commission
is authorized to call upon the at
torney general for legal advice and
lias an appropriation of S3OOO for ex
penses.
The enactment of this resolution
followed complaints to the legislators
that additions, alleged to be unjusti
fied. had been made to the price of
coal because of the anthracite tax.
When the supreme court declared
the tax unconstitutional recently the
~ attorney general asked a rehearing
which was refused. Meanwhile the
auditor general's department took
steps to escheat to the State any
money collected by coal operators or
others for tax to which they were
not entitled.
At the Capitol to-day it was stated
that the future course of the State in
regard to return of the money would

SEES DEFEAT AHEAD
Declares War Was All That |
Saved Them at Last Elec- j
tion; Knocks Tariff
By Associated Press
Washington, D. C„ Jan. 11.—Sen
ator Newlands, of Nevada, Democrat,
attacked his party's record in the Sen
ate to-day, delivering a long prepared
speech In which he criticised the tariff
and banking reforms—the chief legis
lative achievements of the Wilson ad
ministration. He declared that because
there had been indusirial and com
mercial depression coterminous with
Democratic control of legislation, the
party would be ill danger of defeat at
the next presidential election unless
the European war continued and made
the President's "sagacious and firm"
handling of foreign affairs the over- I
shadowing issue.
Although he characterized the gen
eral trend of Democratic legislation as
commendable, the senator asserted
that the party was too radical, and
expressed the conviction "that no po
litical party can hope to remain in
power which adopts radical instead of
evolutionary methods of reform."
sees Defeat Ahead
Danger of a Democratic defeat in
the congressional elections of 1914, he
said, was "averted only by ihe Euro
pean war, which brought into sudden
contrast the President's policy of
watchful waiting regarding Mexico,
with the mad haste of the European
nations as they rushed into war, and

Three Explosions in Short
Time at Du Ponts Make
Workmen Apprehensive
Special to the Telegraph
Wilmington. Del., Jan. 11.—Three
explosions in less than seventeen
hours, with a total of three men Killed
and one hurt, have caused a decided
feeling of uneasiness among the em
ployes of the Du Pont powder plants.
There also is a feeling of anxiety
among the officers of the company,
even though they still positively declare
the explosions were due to accidental
causes and there is no suspicion of
spies or plots. The number of killed
and injured is comparatively small,
considering the number of explosions,
but the number and the fact that they
occurred within a few hours of each
other is what caused the real anxiety.
Two explosions occurred within an
hour or a little more of each other in
the Haglev yard yesterday afternoon,
following the explosion at Carney
Point in the morning. The first ex
plosion amounted to little, but it oc
curred in precisely the same kind of
mill as the one at Carney Point earlier
in the day, except that prismatic in
stead of sporting powder was being
made. Only five pounds of powder
exploded, but Joseph Golt, who was in
charge of the mill, was slightly
bruised.
A little over an hour later there was
a crash which was almost as great as
the noise of the explosion at Carney
Point in the early morning. Buildings
in Wilmington were shaken and the
second severe explosion within such a
short time caused more than the usual
excitement. The second explosion oc
jcurred in what is known as a' mealing
mill, where black sporting powder is
ground.
About 300 pounds of powder went
off in the second explosion.

I.ondon, Jan. 11, 9.53 A. M.—"lt
; seems to us that on present lines the
! central powers have the whip hand of
the United States." says the Man

garding Germany's new promises in
the submarine controversy.
America's diplomatic victory, the
paper goes on to say, is limited to
promises, as President. Wilson's two
principles adopted at the beginning of
the controversy, namely, protection of
Americans and assertion of the laws
of humanity, have been violated dur
ing the past six weeks in the Mediter
ranean with some of the worst sub
marine outrages.
