BRITISH FORCE

Berlin Reports Big Victory
Over Invading Army
in Mesopotamia
JEN THOUSAND ARB!
ENTIRELY CUT OFF
Main Body Being Pursued as
It Continues ijetreat
to Persian Gulf
London, Jan. 10.—The Turks In
Mesoptamia were In full retreat
on January 9 with the British pur
suing them, It was announced in
the house of commons today by J.
Austin Chamberlain, secretary for
India.
Amsterdam, Jan. 10.—A British
force which apparently was on
the way to reinforce the British
at Kut-EI-Amara on the Tigris
river lost 3,000 men in an attack
on Turkish positions at Sheik
8aid, according to a semi-official
statement received here today
from Constantinople. The attack
la declared to have been repulsed.
Berlin, Jan. 10.—The British army
at Kut-EI-Amara in Mesopotamia has
now been surrounded completely by
the Turks, according to Constanti
nople advices given out today by the
Overseas News agency. It is said the
Turks .have advanced to the main de
fenses of the British.
The main British army in Mesopo
tamia. according to these advices, is
10,000 -men having been
left in Kut-EI-Amara to cover the
movement
Recent dispatches have indicated
that the British expedition In Meso
potamia was confronted by Turkish
forces of superior size and that it
would have difficulty in maintaining
Itself at Kut-EI-Amara. The defenses
of the city were attacked by the
Turks some time ago, resulting in se
vere fighting but the British were able
to repulse the assaults.
The retreat from Kut-EI-Amara—as
suming the correctness of the unof
ficial advices from Berlin—apparent
ly means the abandonment by the
British of any attempt for the pres
ent at least of an offensive campaign
In Mesopotamia. It was in November
of 1914 that an Anglo-Indian force,
starting from the Persian gulf, began
marching north and west over the
desert. The fighting was slow and ex
hausting, bat the Brltffch pushed north
ward until in September of 1915 when
ey reached Kut-EI-Amara, which
Is 230 miles northwest of the head of
the Persian gulf. They defeated the
Turks there and advanced to Ctesi
phon, eighteen miles below Bagdad.
The Turks sent up large forces to
save Bagdad and, after an initial de
feat, won a victory over the invaders.
The British fell back on Kut-EI
Amara, 106 miles southeast of Bag
dad, but there has been no previous
intimation that they intended to aban
don this point
ALLIES QUIT DARDANELLES.
Berlin, Jan. lCk.—The sinking of a
transport ship of the allies filled with

al of the French and British forces

la, is reported in Constantinople dis
patches given out today by the Over
seas News agency.
The following dispatch under date
of Constantinople was given out to
day.
"The Milli* agency states that the
Turks were making preparations for
three days for the attack on the Brit
ish and French, and results are not
yet fully known. All the positions of
the enemy near Seddul Bahr and
Teke Burnu were occupied by the
Turks, nine cannon being captured.
Turkish artillery sank an enemy
transport filled with soldiers. An
enormous amount of booty was cap
tured.
"A Turkish aeroplane shot down an
enemy biplane near Seddul Bahr."
The official British account of the
evacuation said that the only casual
ty in connection with the withdrawal
was the wounding of one British sol
dier.

Athens, Jan. 10.—The Greek cruiser
Helli and the, destroyer Leon with a
strong contingent of troops have been

AT CLOSE OF YEAR
ITALIAN MONETARY EXPERT
8
AYS CONDITIONS COULD
NOT BE WORSE.
Rome, Jan. 10.—"From a financial
point of view the year 1915 could not
have closed worse than it did for all
the belligerent countries," said Signor
Luigi Luzzatti, former Italian pre
mier, in an interview published today
in the Tribuna.
"The exchange rate paid by the
central empires," continued Signor
Luzzatti, "is getting worse every day,
evidently due to the requirements of
their purchase abroad, since the ad
vance into the Balkans opened those
markets to them. France, the chief
monetary power in Europe, loses on
the exchange with all countries except
Russia and Italy."
The Italian statesman attributes the
advance In exchange to speculation,
which, In his opinion, should be fought
by the finance departments of the al
lies in conjunction with banks under
state control, as well as by limiting
further issues of bank notes and by
obtaining the payment of taxes and
subscriptions to war loans in values
of a monetary character.
8ERBS' PLIGHT TERRIBLE.
New York, Jan. 10.—-Hardships and
sufferings endured by wounded Serb
ians and Austrian prisoners of the
Serbs in their recent retreat before
the Tuetonic armies invading Serbia
are graphically related by Miss Cissy
Benjamin, an English nurse who ar­|
rived here today. Miss Benjamin said
that hundreds of Serbian wounded
perished of the oold in crossing the
mountains after the flight from Pris
rend and that the plight of thousands
of Austrian prisoners was pitiable.
"The Serbians have not sufficient
bread for their own soldiers and abso
lutely none to give to their prisoners,"
said Miss Benjamin.
The courage and patience of the
Serbian wounded was the most won
derful thing I ever witnessed. The
most severely injured, seemingly dy
ing, walked with ui nir~ weeks at a
time over the mountains into Montene
gro."
GERMANS ON OFFENSIVE.
Berlin, Jan. 10.—An offensive move
ment has been inaugurated by the
German forces in tne Champagne. The
announcement was made by the war
office today that French positions ex
tending over several hundred yards
at a point northwest of Massiges had
been captured by the Germans.
The conquered positions are near
Malsons de Champagne. The Ger
mans captured 423 prisoners, includ
ing seven officers five machine guns,
and one large and several small mine
throwers.
A French counter attack, made to
the east of the positions taken by the
Germans, failed.
On the eastern front an advance at
tempted by strong Russian detach
ments at Belestiany was repulsed.
GERMANS REPULSED.
Paris, Jan. 10.—Heavy attacks were
made yesterday by German troops in
the Champagne, the war office an
nounced today. The German attacks
broke down with heavy losses, the
statement says, and although they
gained temporary foothold in French
positions at various places they were
subsequently driven out everywhere
except from portions of two advanced
trenches.
KAISER NOT VERY SICK
Latest Reports Minimize Emperor's
Illness and Say Only Minor Oper
ation Necessary.
Rome, Jan. 10.—Latest reports re
ceived here regarding the illness of
the German emperor minimize the ser
iousness of his condition and contra
dict wild rumors circulated not long
ago. These reports received from Ger
many through Switzerland say that
the emperor is affected by a malignant
growth In the throat which required
a small operation. Although the oper
ation was slight, it is said, the great
est care was indispensable owing to
the delicate nature of the organs af
fected.
A high church official who undertook
to confirm this report was assured that
the doctors believed that if complica
tions do not arise, a contingency they
think unlikely, the emperor will be
able to resume work this month or
early in February.

Philadelphia, Pa., Jan. 10.—Three
employes were killed and a number
injured in an explosion of powder
early today at the plant of the Dupont
Powder Works at Carney's Point, N.

The cause of the explosion is un
known, but according to the super

Phraseology of Agreement
With Germany Is Only
Matter Unsettled
VON BERNSTORFF HAS
TALK WITH LANSING
Next Step Will Be to Ask
Kaiser's Allies to Be
Guided By Ruling
Washington, D. C., Jan. 10.—Count
von Bernstorff, the German ambassa
dor, and Secretary Landing had an
other conference in the Lusitania ne
gotiations today, which both agreed
should be described as confidential.
That fact is taken by those convers
ant with the status of the case to
mean that Germany and the United
States have approached a point in the
negotiations where only one more
exchange between Washington and
Berlin will be necessary before the
long controversy is ended.
American officials in all quarters
described the situation as "very hope
ful" and reflected the view that a sat
isfactory settlement is in Bight which
will include Indemnities for the 116
American lives lost and expression of
regret or disavowal which will be
mutually satisfactory to Germany and
the United States.
President Wilson, Secretary Lansing
and the German ambassador are prac
tically the only officials in the secret
of the negotiations, but it is known
taht the principal point which has
been delaying the final settlement was
the phraseology.
ITALIAN COMMENT.
Rome, Jan. 10.—"Germany pleads
guilty," says the Glornale Cltalia,
commenting on Germany's latest re
plies to America. The newspaper adds
that Germany, by promising to give
orders to insure the safety of passen
gers before ships are sunk, implicitly
admits that this was not done in the
past and she thus confesses crimes,
the memory of which and of the con
fession itself will be recorded in his
tory.
ITALIANS TAKING
CENSUS OF GRAIN
Rome, Jan. 10.—The decree ordering
that a census be taken no later than
January 26 of all the grain in the
kingdom is explained by officials to
be for the purpose principally of in
dicating to the authorities the quanti
ties that it may be necessary to im
port. It is denied that the order im
plies any intention of establishing
bread rations for the people, as has
been done in Germany.

The administration is said to take

thing remaining to bring the negotia

her allies to follow her lead.

ANTI-TRUST LAW
TO BE USED ONLY
IN EXTREME CASES
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE
UNITED STATES SEEKS TO
REASSURE BUSINESS.
Washington, D. C., Jan. lO.-Reassur
anceeLtQ. Abe business men of the coun
try regarding the policy of the departr
ment of justice in enforcing the Sher
man anti-trust laws are believed here
to be conveyed in a statement of At
torney General Gregory, published to
day in which he outlines his policy.
The statement, issued through the
chamber of commerce of the United
States, was in response to a sugges
tion that an expression from the at
torney general as to the government's
attitude in future anti-trust prosecu
tions "might be regarded as reassur
ing to the public mind," and might
"dispel some of the uncertainty which
heretofore existed."
In announcing the policy in enforc
ing the law In admittedly doubtful
cases, the attorney general said that
where the department was assured of
the good faith of the parties to a trans
action, it had not been and would not
be to invoke extreme penalties against
them.
"In such a case," said Mr. Gregory,
"the department would consider that
the just and appropriate and quickest
way of enforcing the law would be by
a civil proceeding in which the ques
tion involved would be contested or a
consent decree entered, accordingly as
the defendants desired, or by a notice
to the parties of the department's con
clusions with opportunity to abandon
or modify the transaction."
Discussing the means adopted by the
department to guard against unjust
prosecutions, Mr. Gregory declared
that the person or corporation against
whom complaint is made, unless it has
before any action is taken."
Regarding the policy in cases where
It and the federal trade commission
are both charged with enforcinsr the
law.. Mr. Gregory said that the depart
ment would, in general, be guided by
the principle which governs the feder
al and state couits in cases where they
havo concurrent Jurisdiction.
While admitting that there was
some doubt as to the application of the,
