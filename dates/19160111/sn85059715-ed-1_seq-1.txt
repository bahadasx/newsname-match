during the last night drove the enemy
from the outposts positions ho
had occupied with the exception of a small
rectangle to the west of Mai- .
sons-de-Chantpagne, where his small I
forces aro maintaining themselves I
with difficulty. Our goneral fire and I
In particular our nrtillery fire inflicted
heavy losses on the enemy.
"Three of our aeroplanes engaged
yesterday In several tights above the
German lines near Dixmude with enemy
scouting aeroplanes of the Fokker
type. One of our machines attacked
by a Foltker machine had to
descend, but an enemy aeroplane at- *l
tacked in turn by one of ours, which '
tired on ft with machine guns from
H distance of twenty-five meters, was
brought down. A third French ma
chine also attacked another Foklter,
