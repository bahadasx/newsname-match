Washington, Jan. 10. Senator Reed
Sinoot, the apostle, sat up straight in
his office chair and without hatting; an
eye said: "Not one of the favorite
sons will reach the republican nomi
nation. In my judgment it will be
Roosevelt, Hoot or Hughes."
.Moreover Senator Sinoot, still with
out the flicker of un eyelid, added:
' !f Theodore Roosevelt would come
back into the republican party I would j
go on my hands and knees from the

This remarkable statement comes
from a man whose name has been
linked with Penrose and Karnes in the
management of the republican ma
chine which was scored fiercely by
UooseVclt lor its wrongs against m
at Chicago in 1912. He was one of I
the "thieves" who uot awav with the
loot. He was foreman of the burg-1
lars' protective association which
nabbed the diadem just as T. H, was
going to try it on. He was inner
guard of the. house of mirth which
bought, sought aul caught delegates
from the south. He was several
things, this Smoot lad, that T. Tl. held'
in anathema. , I
Put Smoot has no grudge against!
T. H. on that account. In fact he.
rather likes Hooscvelt's pleasant little
way of luying about him in a combat.
That is why he wants him back and
why he would go kneeling across the
continent to g, t him back.

"What is the matter with these fa
vorite Bonn?" I asked Senator Sinoot.
"None of them got a spark of gen

"Cummins, a good man but weak on
