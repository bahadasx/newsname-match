I. JC. C. Rules Patrons Between
Here and Baltimore Must
Pay Additional Thousands.
With Commissioner Clements dissent
ing, the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion today ruled that the Increased
commutation fares on the Philadelphia.
Baltimore and Washington railroad be
tween Baltimore and Washington were
Justified. The commuters, who have
thus lost their fight will be required
to pay many thousand dollars addition
al in faros.
Commissioner Clements baaed his dis
senting opinion on the fact that scores
of communities had been built up by
tho reduced commutation fares, that
thousands of families established their
homes In these communities believing
the low fares would be permanent and
that It had not been shown to his satis
faction that the Increases were neces
sary or. Justifiable. Commissioner Cle
ments said the families residing In the
communities between Baltimore and
Washington could 111 afford to pay the
additional fares which will be required
of them and that the definite and con
vincing Justification which the railroad
should have shown to warrant the
raises had not been established to his
mind. The Increases, after the low fares
have prevailed for so many years, will
work a distinct financial hardship on
the commuters, said Commissioner Cle
trents. Increase Is Legalized.
On the strength of today's decision,
the P. B. and W. legally Increases the
price of sixty trip tickets by 25 cents,
makes the price of the ISO trip tickets
exactly three times the cost of a sixty-
trip ticket and entirely abolishes the
fifty-trip tlcketn. The 180-trlp ticket
price Is Increased by 2S per cent.
In the case decided today, brought
Derore tne interstate commerce com
mission last June by George Mace and
other protesting commuters, the com
mission held that the revenue derived
from commuters between Washington
and Baltimore dla not pay the costs of
operating the trains.

ALL GERMAN TRADE,
111
Would Bind Germany Not to
Engage in Export Business
After War.
By WILBUR S. FOTlttEST.
LONDON. Jan. 11. Insertion of a
clause in the peace agreement binding
Germany to refrain from all- export
business for a period of years Is one of
the methods suggested bv British trade
experts to -cripple German trade after
the war. it was learned today.
Leading London business men gener
ally approved the statement made by
President' Walter Runclmman. of the
board of trade. In commons last nleht.
that Great Britain must so crlnole Ger
man commerce that the Germans can
not again dispute world supremacy with
the British nation. '
The proposal to cut oft Germany's
export business waa the most drastic
made. The men who advocated It de
clared the British navv would have no
trouble enforcing such a clause, but
that Germany might "buy her way out"
bvpaylng a huge Indemnity.
The board of trade already Is In
quiring Into the possibilities of a
general boycott agreement by all the
allied jowera who would refuse to
buy German-made goods for a cer
tain number of years after the war.
At the same time England Is prepar
ing to bid on an enormous scale for
the commerce of neutrals.
Arrangements are almost cnmplote
for the "Industries and Empire Fair."
to be held In London during 1917.
Particular attention will be paid 'at
this world's industrial exhibition to
products formally manufactured al
most exclusively In Germany but
made In England and her colonies
since tho beginning of the war. A
building costing more than ll.OOO.OOU
to ho-jse the exhibits will be erected
at Willesden Green. Efforts will bo
made .to bring commissions of buyers
here frpm every country in the world.

of Its Duties to Own People
and to Mankind, His Tele

CHICAGO, Jan. 11. Calling
on the Progressive national com
mittee to cast aside all purely
partisan considerations, Theodora
Roosevelt today wired a plea for1
preparedness to the committee as
it met in conference prior to se
a
lecting a date for the party's na

Rjoosevelt's 'message declared
that with -the country facing a
great crisis, the nation ha? fallen
far short of its duties for tho'
past eighteen months.
,, The telegram, which was reac
toihe committeemen and scores
of other Progressiva leaders at i
conference preliminary to tha
executive meeting of the commit
tee, was as follows:
ONLY VITAL ISSUES.
"I send you my hearty greet
ings. We as a country are fac
ing a great world, crisis in
which, for the last eighteen
months this nation has fallen
far short of its duty, both to
its own people and to the law
abiding and justice-Iovfng na
tions of mankind. There is a
crying need that we rhall cast
aside all p'urely partisan consid
erations and disregard all but
the vital issues affpetihg the
national life, and shall striv-whole-heartedly
for n sound
Americanism, which shall -insist
that every man who is- within
our borders shafl be all Amer

"We must do justice to our .
own people at home; we must
insist that they have justice
when abroad. We must insist
upon the most thorough-going
preparedness to protect our
rights against all possible at
tacks by any aggressor. Such
preparedness is the bst guar
antee of honorable peace. We
muBt ever remember that there
cannot be such preparedness in
things material unless there is
also that preparedness of soul
and of spirit, which -lonc ren
ders a nation fit to perform it
