At least one of tlie great wrongs
committed during the civil war will
be made right within a few days,

return to Mrs. Ro&a Johnston Robin
eon of Louisville, Ky., the Yale class
Book of 1852 belonging to her fath
er, the late Col. William Preston
.. Johnston. The pilfering o$ some
Southern homes during the civil war
and the keeping of these relics and
mementoes, has called forth a storm
of stern rebuke by pen and tongue
since that period.
This book in question, was bought
for $7 from a soldier comrade by
the late J. R. Letts, a veteran of the
(tvil war. It had been pillaged from
the Johnston home by a ruthless
despoiler's hand, although it is a
volume which could have no possi
ble value for any but the owner, to
whom it would be 'priceless. Mr.
Letts always felt that if the oppor
tunity offered, he would be glad to
return tho yolume to its rightful
.pwner.
The volume is a handsome ode,
heavy, bound In gold lettered calf,
Ith'tbe sane of the owner ana-the
3ar stamped upon its cover. The
paper is of heavy vellum, and the
book Is flllud With exquisite steel en
gravings of the entire Yale faculty
of 1852, and also the members of the
class. The blank pages opposite
each engraving are filled with the
autographs of Col. Johnston's class
mates. Among the names promi
nently stands forth that of William
H. Odell. Some of the autographs
are verses from favorite poems oth
ers are of a sentimental rfature and
still others were written with a cer
tain dignified facetiousncss which
marks the college wit of 1852

The engraving of the owner shows
him a dignified young man with
beardless facc and grave, brooding
eyes, while his broad brow is over
hung with a heavy thatch of dark
hair.
At somb time in 1899, the either
Mr. Letts found a newspaper dis
patch from Lexington, Va., announc
ing the death of Col. William Pres
ton Johnston, president of Tulane
University, of New Orleans, La'. This
notice Mr, Letts pasted in the book
beneath the engraving of the own
er for future reference. Last sum
mer, the surviving members of the
Letts family agreed that the just
thing to do was to make extensive
inquiry for the living descendants
of Col. Johnston and deliver the
book to themi This duty devolved
upon J. W. LettB, who, in his several
months search for the family, re
tains an interesting correspondence
with many well known and notable
people, including William Howard
Taft and Rev. Anson Plielps Stokes
of Yale, and also members of the
Johnston connection in the south
land.
These have vouchsafed the infor
mation that Col. Jblinston ,was the
son of Albert Sidney Johnston, who
was killed at the battle of Shiloh
that he went into the war from
Louisville, Ky.. and was colonel of a
regiment at the first battle of Man
assus. After this, his health be
came impaired and for the remain
der of the Mrar he was on the staff
of Jefferson Davis in Richmond. Col.
Johnston was with Davis on his re
treat and was captured with him.
He was confined in a southern prison
for six months after the war, after
which period he returned home.
The story is an interesting one
the scattered family of six children
he left, of whom only two daughters
are now living—the eldest, Mrs. Ro
sa Robinson, who will receive the
precious memento of her father's
honorable yllege life—perhaps the
only happy memory of the North lie
-was destined to retain.
Mr. Letts has been painstaking ill
his efforts to have the book reach
the rightful owner and has found
the traditional family connections
who attempted to steer the valuable
volume into their own family. Tl)e
last letter received by Mr. Letts was
from the eldest daughter of the sub
ject of this sketch, who warmly ex
presses her gratitude for the thought
and effort directed towards restoring
this book to its rightful owners.
So, romantically, ends another civ
il war episode, and it would1 be of
inestimable credit to the North,
should every northern family having
in their possession' confiscated civil
war plunder make strenuous efforts
to return it to the descendants.
A CHALLENGE TO

Editor of the Christian Socialist
Would Like to Meet Him in
Debate.
Chicago, Jan. 6.—Eds. Freeman
Tribune, Webster City, la.—I note
that Petet W. Collins is writing you
from Chelsea, Mass., in regard to
Christianity and Socialism. I have
been trying in vain to get Mr. Col
lins to answer arty letter I sent him
direct. Perhaps if you publish a
challenge he will be smoked out of
his corner.
I desire to meet Mr. Collins iri a
public debate, under fair conditions,
on the question, "Resolved, that
Christianity and Socialism are Com
plementary." His reply to that chal
lenge delivered by him at Webster
City was to shriek and rave at the
"blasphemy" of the subject, -a per
formance which seems to have dis
gusted ^hose. who watehed it.

An Organized Survey of Rural
Church Conditions Will be
Commenced in the Near
Future.
FINISHED WITHIN THE YEAR
Such Hen aa Henry Wallace and
John Sh&mbough Interested
in Iowa Movement.
An organized survey of rural
church conditions in Iowa, including
those in Hamilton county, will be
commenced in a short time and com
pleted in about a year. Word of the
prospective survey came today from
Columbus, Ohio, and names of a
number inep in this state who have
the plans under consideration were
made known. The arrangements
were discussed at tho national
church and country life conference
held recently in Columbus, where
President Wilson was one of the
speakers. Delegates from this state
held a special conference at that
meeting to formulate tentative plans
for a rural church survey, to be
started as soon as possible after
their return.
Among the persons who are ex
pected to be leaders in the movement
in Iowa are John Shambough,
Booneville Hill M. Bell, Des
Moines Henry Wallace, Des Moines:
Edw. Roberts, Donncllson: Rev.
Hadwen Williams, Jesup A. M.
Case, Oskaloosa Rev. Paul H. llei
sey, Des Moines Mrs. J. Ren Lee,
Clarinda Rev. S. M. Musselman,
Wayland.
Similar surveys are contemplated
in most other states. Working plans
are to be modelled after those used
during the past year in Ohio, where
the first state-wide scientific inquiry
into country church conditions ever
made in the United States is now be
ing completed by a state association
working under the supervision of
the .Commission on Church and
Country Life. This commission is a
subsidiary body of the Federal Coun-

there.
The results, shown then Would be
used as tlie basis for an education

tend their functions to incltlde some
of these interests:
several churches in

agricultural college extension work,
co-operation among farmers for
buying, selling and producing, con
solidated schools, public recreation,
and establishment of social and rec
reational centers at churches. Coun
try preachers are to be urged to ed
ucate themselves moro thoroughly in
the practical interests and needs of
a community, without sacrificing
purely religious work.

Among the results indicated- by
the incomplete rural church survey
in Ohio are these: Eighty-three per
cent of the churches have less than
100 members and 21 per cent have
less than 25. Only one in 16 has
an individual preacher and a large
proportion of preachers get about,
the same pay as a day laborer. Less
than 40 per cent of the rural popu
lation are church members. Only
one third are increasing in member
ship and one church in nine has been
abandoned in recent years.

New Ruling by Interstate Commerce

The new ruling by tlie Interstate
Conimerco Commission concerning
passenger rates between states will
go into effect on Saturday morning,
cil of Churches, an inter-denomina-1 Jan. 15th. FVom that time forward,
indefinitely, at the rate of 2.4 cents
per mile, it will cost Webster City
people |8.74 to go from this city to
tional organization of heads of
churches in the United States.
Each of the hundreds of volun
teer workers who would be employ
ed in such a survey as that contera-

from Webster City to Minneapolis,
where it formerly cost them $4.19.
To go from this city to Omaha it
will cost $4.02. Formerly it cost
$3.43.
The increased rates will affect the
prices from this city to small towns
on branch roads in other states ev
en more than direct lines into large
cities. There are several reasons
for this increase in interstate pas
senger rates. Among them are the
Illinois Central Railroad company
the C. & N. W. R. R. Co. the C. B.
& Q., etc., ad infinitum.
Rates from any point within the
borders of Iowa to another city
within the state limits are unaffect
ed by this new ruling.
Clifford Thorne, member of the
Iowa board of railroad commission
ers, made a vigorous fight against
this increase, but received little help
from the people of the state. Many
of th'e newspapers of Iowa, while
pretending to stand for the inter
cuts of the people, have severely
condemned Mr. Thorne for not
quietly acquiescing in the railroad
program.
