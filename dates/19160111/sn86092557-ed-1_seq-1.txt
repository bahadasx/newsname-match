artillery fire, our trench defenses and
I our counter attacks completely set at
naught an important attack undertak
ien by the enemy in which at least 3
German divisions took part. Counter
attacks and hand grenade fighting by
our men during the night drove the
j enemy from our post positions he had
occupied with the exception of a small
rectangle to the west of Maisons de
Champagne where his small forces are
maintaining themselves with difficul
ty. Our general fire and in particular
our artillery fire inflicted heavy losses

One of our machines attacked by a
Fokker machine had to descend but
an enemy aeroplane attacked in turn
by one of ours which fired on it with
machine guns from a distance of 35
