Three Negro Preachers
In Phoenix Lock Doors
On Flocks to Stop Dance
Phoenix, Ariz.. Jan. 11. One way to
keep church members from going to
dances is to lock them- In church. It
has been used effectively by the pas
tors of the three Phoenix negro con
gregations. The local lodge of negro Masons an
nounced that Its annual ball would-ba
held on a certain eveninp. The pastors
of the African M. E. chureh. Second
Baptist church and Tanner chapel went
among their respective flocks and ex
horted them not to go. but they learned
that most of the negro population of
Phoenix Intended to be at that ball, no
matter what their spiritual leaders
thought about It
Thereupon the ministers got their
heads together and each announced
that upon the evening of the ball there
would be a special prayer meeting
Certain members of their congregation
then decided that they would attend
the prayer meetings and later go to the 1
wan, uiuH serving viuu anu xerpsicnore
in the same evening.
But tiie prayer meeting was unac
countably prolonged. Some In the rear
Pews thought to slip quietly out 1
wirougn tne iront aoor. They found
the door locked. Then they tried the
windows, only to find them also se
curely barred and locked. Explana
tions were demanded of those In au
thority, but the only explanation forth
coming was that the way to freedom
would be open when prayer meeting
was over, file same scene was enacted
In the three different churches.
