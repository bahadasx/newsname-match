EL PASO, Jan. 10 Slight hope for
the recovery of General Victoriano
Huerta remained toniqht, when his
physician, Dr. M. P. Schuster, stated
the patient was gradually losing
strength and that his illness had
reached a critical stage.
The statement af Dr. Schuster to
night was given shortly after General
Huesta had been again tapped and two
quarts of fluid removed from the in

In as of this country, was taken under
consideration today by the United
States grand jury here. Numerous
witnesses were examined, several of
them having been brought here from
Paso 1); the government in an
ffort to have the . aged Mexican
dictator indicted for n alleged at
tempt to launch a new revolution in
Mexico from headquarters in this
country.
Not Yet in Old Capital
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10. Restora
tion of the -old rapital as the seat of
government in Mexico apparently has
been icvdponed jndefin'tel . Advices
both to the state department and to
the Mexican embassy here indicate
that General Carranza will remain
for weeks and probably months at
Queritaro, making that place his
headquarters, as he formerly did Vera
Cruz.
Military and civilian chieftains of
the defacto government are gathered
at Queretaro for a general conference
ailed bv General Carranza. Dis
patches to the slate department to
day announced the arrival there of
General Obregon and other leaders.
It is expected thit after the con
ference will come the announcement
of a new cabinet.
While the military situation in Mex
ico has leen simplified hy the sur
render of the piinclpr.1 Villa forces,
it still is far from cleared up and the
de facto government ' has only fairly
started the task of pacification. Al
most no hope now is held here that
Villa will leave the country, and some
of the reort8 received indicate he is
having some success in gathering to
gether a number of the leaders of in
dependent bands vet operating in
western Mexico.
The recent capture of Gomez Pal
achio by Benjamin Argumedo is not
regarded by the American government
as of great importance, notwithstand
ing it is a suburb of the important
lailway center of.Torreon.
Argumedo's appearance in the north,
however, has arouRed interest here be
cause his personality and record is
such that it is feared he may fill the
vacancy as a popular rebel leader
created 'by the collapse of Villa. The
tact that he is popular with the Za
pata element also is considered a
dangerous factor.
J. R. Silliman again is with Gen

OUTLOOK BRIGHT FOR
EARLY SETTLEMENT OF
THE LUSITANIA CASE
United States and Germany
Agree On Essential Prin
ciples Involved and Only
Details Are Holding Up
Final Adjustment
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10. Difficulty
in agreeing upon details is holding up
a final settlement of the Lusitania con
troversy. Count von ilernstorff, the
German ambassador, and Secretary
Lansing had another conference today
and it was said later that no final
agreement had been reached, although
the outlook was encouraging.
While the l'nited States and Ger
many virtually have agreed upon the
essential principles involved, it was
learned tonight that until a method of
expressing these principles satisfac
tory to both sides is found, announce
ment of a settlement will be withheld.
Count von Bernstorff was informed
in effect by Secretary Lansing during
today's conference that the wording of
the tentative proposal submitted last
week by Germany, and since consider
ed by President Wilson, was inade
quate in certain respects.
A feeling of optimism regarding the
ultimate outcome of the negotiations
apparently prevails both in official and
Teutonic diplomatic circles. It is free
ly predicted that a settlement accept
able to both governments should be
reached by next Monday, unless un
foreseen events intervene.
liy Monday Count von Hernstorff
should receive a reply to a dispatch
prepared tonight for the Berlin foreign
office. This is believed to contain the
results of his latest efforts, and sug
gestions regarding certain desires of
the United States to be embodied in
the final settlement.
These suggestions, it was authorita
tively stated, had to do solely with
j questions involved in the subject of re
; prisal and the British blockade of
Germany, which the United States and
Germany both declare to be illegal.
Consideration of public opinion in the
United States and in Germany is un
derstood to be playing an important
part in hastening a settlement. Ger
many contends that the destruction of
the Lusitania was an act of reprisal
and while deploring the fact that
Americans lost their lives in the com
mission of the act, she considers pub
lic opinion in Germany would ad
versely criticise any action that would
admit the illegality of torpedoing the
vessel, under the circumstances. Oer-

order to break the Austrian line at
all costs. The officers were assured
that there were sufficient troops to
accomplish this.
The main attack thus far has. been
directed against a bill named Fort
Baltin, in honor of General I'flanzer
.Baltin, which the emperor presently
ordered taken. As a result literally
thousands of Russian dead lie before
the Austrian trenches or hang sus
pended on the Wire entanglements.
Entire regiments were wiped out,
while the Austrian losses are declared
to have been comparatively small.
Not only was the artillery ammuni

the rifles of the Russian captive also
were Japanese.
T
ment officials that the l'i06 pure food
law designated as misbranded drugs
or medicines which were accompanied
in interstate commerce by knowingly
false statements about the curative ef
fects of the compounds. The supreme
court decided however, that the 1906
law applied only to misbranding as to
the identity or composition of drugs.
In response to a message from
President Taft, congress in 1912 en
acted the Sherley amendment, which
the supreme court held today struck
precisely at misstatements either on
the label or in printed circulars accom
panying medicines.
"We find no ground," said" Justice
Hughes, "for saying that congress may
not condemn interstate transportation
of swindling preparations accompanied
by false and fraudulent statements as
well as lottery tickets."
The justicl- held that congress had
not entered the field of difference of
opinions between schools and practi
tioners but had merely sought to ex
clude "false and fraudulent" state
ments from interstate commerce. He
held the law was not speculative in its
nature, because an Intent to deceive
was a fact as susceptible as other facts
in every day life.
The decision was announced in the
case of a Chicago drug concern which
shipped medicine from Chicago to
Omaha, described in an accompanying
circular as a compound which it knew
had cured and wViuld cure tuberculosis.
The government proceeded under the
Sherley amendment to confiscate the
product and the Nebraska federal dis
trict court condemned the shipments.
The action was affirmed today by the
supreme court.

WHILE QUIET ON RUSS
FRONT HARD FIGHTING
REPORTED ELSEWHERE
Petrograd Statement Says
Calm on Czernowitz Front
Is Due to Huge Losses
.and Demoralization of
Austro-Hungarians
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON, Jan. 10 While the Rus
sian front has been quiet during the
past 24 hours there has been severe
fighting in the other war theaters.
On the Montenegrin front the Aus
trians have been generally successful.
They have advanced their positions
it several important points despite
the handicap of snow waist deep,
and are showing themselves just as
adept a.s the Montenegrins in moun
tain fighting, which heretofore has
been regarded as the particular spe
cialty of the Montenegrin soldiers.
In Champagne the French have re
pulsed four German attacks. The
Germans have retained, however, a
foothold at two places in the French
advanced trenches.
In Persia, British reinforcements on
their way to the relief of Kut-EI-Amara
have met Turkish forces which
were compelled to retire alter some
heavy fighting.
The Petrogr.id official communica
tion says that the calm on the Czer
nowitz front is due to huge losses and
resulting demoralization of the
Austro-Hungarian army. That there
is some basis for this statement is
ewdent from the estimate of the
Hungarian newspaper. Pester Lloyd,
that the losses on both sides of the
Bessarabian battles so far exceed
l"r,U0M, or "more than the utal Brit
ish losses in the whole Dardanelles
campaign.
Another Hungarian newspaper
states, on the authority of a staff
report that the fighting on this front
has been the bitterest and bloodiest
sacrificing men in a manner without
parallel.
The Saloniki front is chiefly notable
in the day's dispatches as the scene
of almost continued aeroplane skirm-I
ishing, one of which contii.usd for
two hours. The Germans have thus
f;'r lost six aeroplanes in this region.
The rumor that the consuls of the
Teutonic allies arrested at Saloniki
had been released appears to have
been without foundation, as it Is now
announced that they have been trans
ferred to a French auxiliary cruiser
on which they have lieen interned.
Extensive Turkish reprisals ar al
irjuly announced bv the ' central
powers.
Vlie present situation in Albania
was thus summed up to day by Lord
Robert Cecil, under-secretary for for
eign affairs, in the house of com
mons: "I regret to say that it is impossible
to speak of Albania as an entity at
present. In the central area over
which Essad Basha's authority extends,-the
relations between the Ser
bian soldiers and the population have
been friendly and Essad Ppsha has
rendered them valuable assistance.
The northern tribes, among whom
the enemy has conducted considerable
propaganda, are hostile to the Ser
bians and Montenegrins.''
Several lengthy dispatches have
been received here giving details of
the recent operations in eastern Gali
cia. which were so meagerly described
in the official reports. According to
these dispatches the Russians, after
artillerv preparation which showed
there was no longer any shortage in
their big-gun ammunition, started an
effensive which caused the Austro
Germcns to rush every available di
vision to Galicia.
Czernowiiz is still in the possession
of the Austrians and is filled with
wounded. But the Russians- appar
ently are directing their main attack
against Sodagora, north of the Ruko-
wina capital, where five important
roads converge.
In the Balkans reports persist that
the Germans are concentrating at
Monastir preparatory to an attack
on Saloniki, but the interest in the
Macedonian campaign has become sec
ondary to the operations of the Aus
trians in Montenegro. A determined
attack is being made on Mount Lov
cen, a Montenegrin stionghold over
looking Cattaro, by the guns of the
Austrian fortress at Cattaro and Aus
trian warships lying in the Adriatic.
The formidable Austrian forces in
vading Montenegro extend .over a
wide front, from the river Tara in

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON, Jan. 10. The debate in
the house of commons tonight was
chiefly remarkable for the unanimity
of the members in urging the govern
ment to exert the largest possible de
gree of economic pressure on Germany
and in recommending that steps should
immediately be taken to prevent any
menace from German trade warfare di
rected against the entente allies after
peace is signed.
A resolution was adpoted that "with
a view to increasing the power of al
lies in the prosecution of the war. His
Majesty's government should enter
into immediate consultation with the
governments of the dominions, in or
der, with their aid, to direct the whole
economic strength of the empire, in
C(. -operation with the allies against the
enemy."
The principal speech made by Wal
tei Runciman, president of the board
of trade, whose emphatic declarations
on the importance of maintaining Brit
ish trade were regarded as largely di
lected toward making clear the posi
tion which caused him to hesitate to
endorse Premier Asiuith's compulsion
policy last week.
"While the war is on," he said, "we
must do everything in our power to
cripple and destroy German finance,
credit and trade, at the same timo
building up our own and our allies, and
laying the foundation for future action
when peace comes."
In the course of the debate there
were some references to the danger of
competition with the United States,
which one member declared would be
Great Britain for America.
"The member has spoken of Amer
ica as a dangerous commercial rival,"
he said, "but I cannot conceive of that
competition taking the complex, scien
tific and destructive form of Germany's
competition."
The last half hour of the session
was devoted to a discussion of Mr.
Lloyd-George's suppression of the
Glasgow labor newsparer, "Forward."
Mr. Lloyd-George quoted extracts from
the paper beginning in July. Some of
them contained offensive references to
the king: others declared .that the war
bad been engineered by capitalists
merely to increase their profits.
On the day that he visited Glasgow-,
the paper contained an attack on the
Derby recruiting scheme, that, the
minister declared, was "one of the most
insidious appeals to the working
classes not to enlist which I ever read "
"There is no intention," continued
Mr. Lloyd-George, "of supressing free
speech and it is childish to say that the
paper was suppressed because a min
ister's vanity was offended. The paper
for months had been trying to stir up
disaffection in a district more impor
tant for the equipment of the army and
navy than any other in the kingdom.
