TWO LITTLE LAWTON GIRLS
ARE SEIZED BY WANDERLUST
. BUT CRUEL COPS SPOIL PLANS
They were Just liftlo girls, mere
tots, the oldest of whom had seen
only a dozen summers and wlntors,
but having become afflicted with
wanderlust, otherwise described as the
go-somewhere desire, they set forth on
a Journey to see more of the wonders
of the wide, wide world.
Lawton was tho point from which
they embarked on their voyage of ad
venture and all went well till they
reached Chickasha where, alas, a cruel
chief of police butted in and queered
their plans and they were peeved be
yond all expression. '
Evelyn, aged; 12, daughter of T. H.
Flynn, superintendent of construction
on tho government building at Law,
ton, was the leader of the expedition,
and the first mate and crew consisted
of Lorinne Sanders, aged 11, daughter
of "a Lawton merchant. Their Journey
began when the Frisco passenger
train left Lawton yesterday afternoon,
and It ended when the train arrived
at Chickasha. Parents of the children
had learned of their trip and tele
phoned the police here too look for
them. Chief Phillips went to the train
and when the conductor stepped off he
inquired for the children, learning
that they were aboard. "Just tell
them that there Is a man here who
wants t see them," said the chief.
Tho conductor delivered the message
and the little girls appeared. One of
them was sent back for tho little hand
bag which contains.l their baggage
and then they accompanied the chief
to the police station. Mr. Phillips
soca had Mr. Flynn on the wird, in
forming him that he would take good
care or the children till their parents
came for them.
"What are you going to do with us?"
asked Evelyn at the police station.
"I'm going to take you to my house
where you can play with my 1'ttle
girls till your papas come after you,"
replied Mr. Phillips. "No you won't
do anything of the kind." shot back
Evelyn. "We are going to a hotel
wo don't want to stay with you," and
Lorinne seconded the motion, saying,
"I've never been to a hotel and that's

raging.
THREE INJURED
MORE SERIOUSLY
THAN REPORTED
Later rcuorts indicate that the vic
tims of the Cravens car accident Mon
day morning were more seriously hurt
than was reported.
Mrs. Jack Cravens, who was In the
car with Mr. Cravens at the time of
the accident, has, it is feared, sus
tained more serious injuries than was
at first supposed. In his efforts to
avoid striking Mrs. Watkins, Mr.
Craven, as told in yesterday's Express
swerved his car so suddenly that it
was overturned, throwing thereby
both himself and Mrs. Cravens vio
lently to asphalt-paved streets. Mrs.
Cravens is suffering from a number
of severe bruises and strains and has
been confined to her bed-all day today.
Mr. Cravens has so far recovered from
the effects of his fall as to be able to
come down town this afternoon.
Mrs. Edna T. Watkins, deputy court
clerk, is reported as resting as easily
as might bo expected, but still suffer
ing Bevere pains. Mrs. Watkins has
been moved to tho home of her
parents, Mr. and Mrs. J. R. Callaham.
While no bones were broken, most
fortunately, at tho same time Mrs.
Watkins is said to have suffered some
f-evere cuts and bruises, which will
confine her to her room for several
where I want to go." The hard
hearted chief was obdurate, however,
and it was to his home that the adven-
turers went.
"Where were you going?" asked
reporter, and Evelyn answered, "To
Tulsa."
Why did you stop here?" was
asked. "That thing came to the train
end got us," answered the child, point
ing to the big chief.
"Why did you leave home, didn't
they treat you well?" was inquired.
"Oh yes, mamma and papa are Just as
good as they can be, lmt we don't like
Lawton and we wanted to go some
place. We Just don't like Lawton
tell you."
Evelyn said she had "saved up" five
dollars, and with it she bought two
tickets to Tulsa, having eighty cents
left. The spent ten cents on the train
and they had seventy-five cents in
the treasury when they reached Chick
asha. "'
"Did you Intend to run away to
stay?" asked the reporter. "Oh, no,"
was the reply. "We expected to go
to a hotel in Tulsa and write to papa.
I guess he would have sent us money
or come after us. No, we don't know
anybody at Tulsa and have never been
there."
Evelyn said she and Lorinne were
near neighbors. They packed their
handbag and slipped it over to
Lorinne's house tho day before they
left and then when the time came
they Just marched down to the station.
"I'll Just bet that Old Peoples told
them where we were going," remarked
F-alyn. "Who is Mr. Peoples?" was
asked. "Oh, he knows us well ana
we met him on the way to the train,
and he Just made us tell whero we
were going."
Chief Phillips sent for his two little
(laughters to come down to the station
to accompany the visitors home with
him and when they started ne of
them took the hand of Lorinne, putting
Iier arm around her and Lorinne
seemed to bo quite content to go. This
morning the parents of the wanderers
cama from Lawton .and took them
back.

ARMY PLAN
IS OPPOSED
BY LEADERS
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11. Tho rising
opposition to the administration's pre
paredness plan was considered todny
at a meeting of tho cabinet.
It is understood that Chairman Hay
of the house committee on military af
fairs told the president that the con
tinental army plan was apparently
doomed, but that sentiment in the
house favors some increase in the reg
ular army and expansion of the na
tional guard.
The half-hearted support of the
Democratic leaders in congress is tho
outstanding featuro of the situation
that now exists. Representative Henry
of Texas Is regarded as secretly hos
tile to the administration's plans,
while Senator Gore of Oklahoma is
eaid to be openly opofud.
BASKET BALL
GAME TONIGHT
The United States army team from
Fort Sill will be liere this evening to
meet the C. H. S. quintet tonight.
Both are fast teams and a hard, pep
pery struggle is assured.
Last year Chickasha won over the
soldiers by a narrow margin, but
Judging by the record of the Fort Sill
team this year of five games won, they
will have to go some to duplicate the
feat of last year.
"However," said ono of the Chick
asha crowd, "wo have confidence in
some of the tall, rangy boya of the
local team. Most of theni are mem
bers of the football team and have
been in fine condition since the first
of school."
In addition to this game the high
school girls' team will play the eighth
grade girls. The latter have shown
their superiority over several teams
this season while the high school girls
recently trimmed Tuttle to the tune
of 14 to S.
Tho high school students expect
everybody to turn out and root loyally
for the home team Just as was done
during the football season. The pri
of admission to the two games is 15
cents.
The high school team will be picked
from the following:

NEGRO PAYS HIGH FOR
FLOURISHING GUN
Notwithstanding the fact that one
negro now languishes In tho Grady
county Jail, charged with murder,
Leonard Hawkins, another citizen of
the darker section of Chickasha,
started out last evening to put the
fear of the hereafter into the hearts
of his fellow countrymen.
Hawkins was armed with a six-gun
of modern pattern and heavy caliber
carrying capacity. He is said to have
flourished this weapon of destruction
along, about, over, across and through
"Two" street, while he delivered san
guinary lectures to all who chanced
to come within hearing of his voice.
Finally, tiring of the sport of abusing
every negro in Chickasha, Hawkins re
paired to his home, still armed witn
his gun and a determination to make
angels out of any one interfering.
An! Berry Williamson came along
and interfered. Hegrabbed tho "bad
nigger" by the left elbow and haled
him Into police station. This morning
Mayor Coffman, with his most winning
smile, unloaded a twenty-five dollar
fine on Hawkins. Illawkins is in the

PLANNING
TO CRIPPLE
GERMANY
By WILBUR S. FORREST.
U. P. staff correspondent.
I LONDON, Jan. 11. The insertion of
a clause in the final peace agreement,
binding Germany to refrain from all
export business, is one of the methods
suggested by the British board of
trade for crippling German trade after
the war is over.
Advocates of the plan declare that
the British navy would have no
trouble in enforcing such a clause, but
that Germany might buy her way out
of it with a huge indemnity.
The board of trade is already inves
tigating the possibilities of a general
boycott agreement among the allies to
refuse to buy German made goods for
a number of years after the war.
At the same time England is pre
paring to bid on an enormous scale
for the commerce of neutral nations.
ARRESTED FOR
FALSE PRETENSE
D. R. Ireton was arrested by the

charged with obtaining money from
John Dryden under false pretense.
Judge Moore set Saturday, January 15,
at 1 o'clock p. m. as the date for
holding the preliminary and ordered
Ireton held until thnt time in bonds lu
the sum of $750. Failing to give bond,
defendant was remanded to the county
Jail.
Several days since Ireton, while in
Chickasha, found himself in need of
funds and prevailed on John Drydan
to cash a check drawn by him, Ireton,
on the First State bank of Alex for
two dollars. At the time, the infor
mation filed by the county attorney
alleges, Ireton told Dryden he had on
deposit in the Alex bank $64. The
check was returned marked "No
funds." Investigation is said to have
shown that Ireton misrepresented
things all around when he secured
the cash on the check.

By WILBUR S. FORREST.
U. P. staff correspondent.
DORCHESTER, Eng., Jan. 3. (By
mail.) "Prisoners of war or not,
they're human." Such is the philoso
phy of Major W. C. Bulkley, D. S. O.,
British regular army, who commands
England's largest war prison camp
here at Dorchester.
More than 3,000 of the Teutons who
fought for the Kaiser on the western
front during the last fourteen months
are reaping the benefit of British
leniency in this model city, built ex
clusively for their use on the outskirts
of this historic British town. No
other press representative was along
on this trip, today and is it the first
time an outsider has been permitted
to inspect every nook and corner of
the camp and talk unreservedly .to the
prisoners.
Surrounded by a double fence of
American barbed wire flanked by wire
entanglements, hundreds of substan
tially built, one-story houses, electric
lighted, amply windowed and roofed,
have been built to accommodate tho
prisoners. The houses are in ruws,
fronted by streets and cross streets
which swarm with German grey-green
uniforms. The main gate opens into a
large parade ground surrounded on
three sides by barracks which were
used in peace time by a regiment of
British cavalry. In these barracks
where Hanoverians captured in 1914,
ire living today, a regiment of Han
overians fighting for England a hun
dred years ago, was quartered.
"I've got an uncle in San Francisco,"
said one of the prisoners when ha
earned that an American was within
earshot
"Where does he live in san Fran?"
"He lives on Jackson street. I used
to visit him often," answered the pris
oner in perfect English. A well built
youth whose counterpart is in every
American city, was leaving the camp
postoffice with a small decorated
Christmas tree sent by his family in
Germany. He had stood in line for
thirty minutes until his name was
called, and he had eagerly grabbed the
tinseled evergreen as an officer, who
first inspected it, handed it over. Stop
ping a minute to talk he rushed off
to his hut where the same tree a few
minutes later had the place of honor
on a big table in the center of the
room, with forty other prisoners ad
miringly looking on.
This prisoner used to be a sailor on
a Seattle-Frisco steamer. When Ger
many declared war he hurried back to
the Fatherland.
An enormous kettle in one of the
large camp cookhouses was presided
over by a big fellow who used to be
a chef in Germany. He was making
tea for eight hundred men, but stopped
a moment to explain that he had rela
tives In Mississippi. Another pris
oner, nearby, was cutting quarters of
beef into small cubic hunks for soup.
A crate of cabbages and lenllis was
on hand to flavor the stew.
On tho same street with this cook
house was the school building, also
the shower baths and gymnasium. In
the school building, classes are heard
by young men who used to teach at
Heidelberg. He's a teacher of lan
guages. The effect of rigid military
discipline imposed by the German
army was manifest In the way the
shower baths, occupying two build
ings, are always in use.
"Turn out!" ordered a British
officer conducting the Inspection.
Forty German heels clicked, or would
have clicked if shod, as twenty Ger
man youths in "altogether" stood
rigidly at attention. The gymnasium
encloses many appurtenances for
