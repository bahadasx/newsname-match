STILL HOLDS SWAT
Crookston, Minn., Jan. 11.Prom-
ise of the abatement of the grip epi

zero weather has been shattered, as
usually with cold weather there is
more sickness.
Doctors have been kept on the

because of the grip epidemic, and
the end is not yet.
Ministers declare that their pas
toral duties have been greatly in
creased during the past few weeks
and as a result are making many calls
a day.
The fact that many are recover
ing leads to the belief that the epi
demic is wearing itself out, notwith
standing the fact that there is
scarcely a family in Crookston that
has not had one or more members
laid up on account of that malady.
