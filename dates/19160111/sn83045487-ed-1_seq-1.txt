AS A CHIEF, HEALEY IS
A GREAT TRAFFIC
SQUAD HEAD
That's the Claim of Aid. Rodriguez Asks Why Many
Ordinances Which Would Have Helped Chicago
Have Been Dodged and Not Enforced.
What does the city council think
about the chief of police? What do
the aldermen think of a man -who
has ignored, stalled and failed to en
force the ordinances passed by that
body.
One alderman, Wm. Rodriguez,
says that Chief Healey should be
ousted for the good and welfare of
the people of Chicago.
"His whole attitude throughout his
administration of the affairs of the
department has been tme of incom
petence and shows his inability to
grasp the situation," said Rodriguez.
"The department has been consid
ered a joke since his appointment.
Council should demand his discharge
from the position of police chief for
his disregard of vital laws passed by
this body.
"This action by the council would
seem to be in accordance with the
views of the mayor, provided he has
been attentive to the failure of the ,
police department under Healey.
