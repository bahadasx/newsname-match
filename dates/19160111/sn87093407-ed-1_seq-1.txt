SAYS U. sPIS IN CRISIS
CHICAGO. Jan 11 —
A-king the Bull Moose
national committer, in
session here today, to
drop all purely partisan
consider ations, Col.
Roosevelt today wired the
members a plea for pre-
paredness.
In it he declared the
country faces a great
crisis, and that the nation
has fallen far short of its
duties for the past 18
months.
The message did not
mention Roosevelt as a
presidential candidate
» The message waa read by the
Committeemen and scores of other
bull moose leaders at a conference
preliminary to the committee a ex
ecutive session.
Must Insist on Justice
"There Ik a crying need that we
disregard all but Tital Issues affect
Ine our national life," wired Hoose
velt. • and strive wholeheartedly
for a >ound Americanlam which
shall Inalat that every man within
our bordera be an American and
nothing else.
"We muet do Justice to our own
people at home, and inalat that they
|iav<. Justice when they are abroad.
"We muat Inalat upon a moat
loro-golng preparedness to protect
I" rights against all poasible at
rks by any aggressor.
13lieh preparedness is the beat
rantee of an honorable peace
,Wt! must ever remember that
Jere cannot he *uch preparedness
*n thing* material unle** tbere |»
also that preparedness of soul and
aplrit which alone render* a nation
fit to perform lis high and difficult
duties in national and International
life,"
It'-ading between the line*, some
committeemen held that Roosevelt
had Indicated an Intention of mak
ing. if nece«sary, a direct attack
against the Wilson foreign policy.
Atk "Peace With Honor"
"Peace with honor'' I* the only
kind of peace the bull mooters will
accept from the f! O. f\
If the "with honor" can be ob
tained. three fottrt Its of the bull
moose national committeemen fa
vor amalgamation with the mother
party.
Thla wa* the out*tanding feature
today a* the bull moose national
committee gotjlown to the buslne
of their gathering here
A, B. Griffiths of Wa*hlngton
was hitter again*t an amalgama
