DEMOCRAT PARTY
TARGET OF TALK
BY OWN SENATOR
Washington, Jan. 11. Senator New
lands of Nevada, democrat, attacked
his party's record in the senate to
day, delivering a speech in which he
criticised the tariff and banking re
formsthe chief legislative efforts of
the Wilson administration. He de
clared because there had been indus
trial and commercial depression co
terminus with democratic control of
legislation, the party would be in dan
ger of defeat at the next presidential
election unless the European war con
tinued and made the president's "sa
gacious and firm." handling of foreign
affairs the overshadowing issue.
Although he characterized the gen
eral trend of democratic legislation as
commendable, the senator asserted
that the party was too radical, and ex
pressed the conviction "that no po
litical party can hope to remain in
power which adopts radical instead of
evolutionary methods of reform."
Danger' of a democratic defeat in
the congressional elections of 1914, he
said, was "averted only by the Euro
pean war, which brought into sudden
contrast the president's policy of
watchful waiting regarding Mexico,
with the mad haste of the European
nations as they rushed into war, and
which made that policy as popular as
it had theretofore been unpopular."
"The realization that similar pru
dence would keep us out of European
complications," he added, "saved the
party at the last election from the de
feat which would have surely come
as the result of the general prostra
tion of business, popularly attributed
to our economic legislation."

Berlin, Jan. 11 (by wireless to Say-

News Agency establishes the fact that
it was an Austrian submarine which
sank the Italian liner Porto Said in
the Mediterranean last month, causing
the death of six passengers and one
member of the crew. It is asserted
the steamship attempted to ram the
submarine.
The statement follows:
"In reference to the sinking of the
Italian steamship Porto Said by an
Austrian-Hungarian submarine:
"Vienna reports that the submarine
ordered the steamship to stop. The
Porto Said first attempted to escape,
then ran up a white flag and halted.
"When the submarine approached
the steamer, the latter suddenly steer-
i ed at the submarine to ram her. At
that juncture the submarine opened
fire and hit the steamship, which
again came to a halt, and lowered
boats.
Helpless Were Abandoned.
"The submarine ceased firing, drew
up to the steamship and observed that
the persons in the boats which had
put off from the Porto Said were mak
ing for the coast without attempting
to- rescue those swimming in the sea.
The captain of the Porto Said was
told that he would be shot if he did not
save those struggling in the water.
"On the steamship were found two
persons, one of whom was wounded.
They were taken off in a boat from
the submarine, and after the woutded
person had been bandaged, both were
handed over to the captain's boat.
"It was not until after this had
been done that the Porto Said was
torpedoed. Meanwhile the submar
ine, while still giving assistance, was
shelled by a hostile torpedo boat and
a yacht"
