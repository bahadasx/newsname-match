FRANK J.' CANNON
Former Senator on Mormonism,
Tonight's Lyceum Speaker.
Many of us had supposed (hat Mor
monism was an issue of the past. To
the contrary, we are informed that
2,500 Mormon missionaries are circu
lating throughout the United States,
Canada, Mexico, the Hawaii Islands
and Europe. They are gaining
rnpicily and not only in religious mat
ters, but in political circles and in the
world of business as well.
Hon. Frank J. Cannon, who speaks
tonight, was roared in the soclusion
of the Salt Lake Valloy in the inviron
ment of Mormon circlos a thousand
miles from any other civilization.
Racially H Mormon, and proud of
their achievements in many ways, he
never avowed himsolf occlosiastically
a Mormon.
For yars he has been fighting
polygamy in the Mormon church.
When the Mormons pledged them
selves to, do better, he interceded for
them at a time whon thoy wore threat
ened with disfranchisement. His an
tngonisnito some of their practice
howevoa which thoy persisted in
despite flieJr promisee, finally result
ed hi htox-conununicMtioii from the
clui. cli, ;; As a lecturer lie has done
much to expose Mormonism.

ENGLAND LOSES BATTEESHIP'
Believed Germans and Bulgars
Are Planning Great Assault
on Saloniki.
London, Jan. 10. The remaining
positions on Gallipoli peninsula held
by the allies have beon abandoned
with the wounding of. only, onamanr
among the British nnd Fronch ac
cording to a British official statement
issued last night.
This news has been expected for
several days for the retirement" of tho
troops from Anzac and Suvia. buybree
weeks ago left no strategic advantage
to the retention of tho tip of the pen
insula.
Nevertheless, the newswilR be re
ceived with a pang of regret by the
people of the British Isles, as well as
the colonies.
Another pang to the British public
will be cnused by the announcement
of the loss of the battleship King- Ed
ward VII, which has been blown up
by a mine. The brief official statement
on the incident does not revealHKo
scene of the action and merely says
that the disaster occurred in: a. heavy,
sea, despite which the enUre crew
was saved before the ship went.down
The King Edward VII represents
an investment of nearly 1 00,000
pounds and was one of the finest of
tne last class oi preiireaunaugms,. cor
responding in general to the Ameri
can ships of the New Jersey and Ne
braska type, and was only slightly
older than the Natal, which was. sunk
by an internal explosion abouta week
ago.
On the west and east fronts there
have been no developments of large
importance over the week-end. The.
German communication announc.es
that the Germans have completed the
recapture of positions on Hartmanns
Wellerkopf, taken by the French a .
few days before Christmas.
Greek correspondents continued to
assert that the Bulgarians and Ger
mans are hastening plans for an at-,
tack on Saloniki, but the Austrinns are
fighting hard against the Russiansand
Montenegrins and the Bulgars are
largely occupied in a resolute attempt,
to reach the Adriatic, from which they
were only forty miles distant at El
bassan, Albania.
