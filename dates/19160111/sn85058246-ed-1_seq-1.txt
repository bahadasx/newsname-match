BBt
SCHOOLMAN AND
TAXPAYER GIVEN
HISJNSWER
Mr. Cronqulst Asks That Supt. Lar
sen Go on Record as to Accuracy
of Statements
Editor:
My attention is directed to tho ar
ticle In your paper of January 8 on
tho tax question, tho said article be
ing signed by "A Schoolman and
Taxpayer," in which tho said School
man nnd Taxpayer, takes Issue with
ono of tho statements I .made In a
recent artlclo on "Another Vlow of
tho Tax Question," also published- In
a recent issue of your paper.
I am sorry that my friend School
man and Taxpnyor, did not come out
In tho bpon and sign his namo to his
article so that all could know who
ho is, but as ho seems to bo afraid
to do so, or from some other reason
did not do so, I will take tho time
and ask for sufficient of your space
to set this teacher and Taxpayer
right In this matter, and then If ho
has any furhcr come back, let us ail
hopo that he will havo tho nerve to
sign his namo to what ho has to say.
In my artlclo on tho tax question
I made this statement: "Tho best
facts wo havo show conclusively that
moro than eighty per cent of tho
tax money goes to the schools," and
It was this statement to which my
friend objected, inferred that It was
not a fact, and cited a recent r ad
dross given by County Cuporlntcnd
ent Larsen, to provo that tho state
ment was not a fact, and then asks
mo to publish whatever Information
I may havo at hand to prove my
statement.
My friend takes Supt R. V. Lar
son as his authority, and whllo Supt.
Larsen is a very nice gentleman, I
think perhaps ho has enough to do
as superintendent of schools to oc-cupj"hls-tlmo,
without-qualifying as
an expert on the state's revenues,
etc., however his figures and state
ments should bo taken for what they
aro worth of course. In my calcula
tions I have taken the highest source
In tho state, tho state auditor and
all my figures havo come direct from
tho auditor's office. Now then here
Is whtit rty stato auditor says in
speaking of tho appropriations made
by tho tenth legislative session for
tho years 1913 nnd 1014.
"Tho total tax rqvcnuo to the state
on assessed valuations for the cur
rent blennlum approximates $3,150,-
000. Of this amount $1,470,000 went
directly to tho support of tho dis
trict schools and tho high schools.
Out of tho remainder, 28 per cent or
approximately $470,000 was sot aside
for the permanent maintenance funds
of the University of Utah and the
Agricultural College. There re
mained, then, out of tho total tax
revenues, for general stato purposes,
$1,210,000 from which amount thoro
was still further set asldo for educa
tional Institutions and purposes ap
proximately $835,000 additional. This
makes a grand total of $2, 775,000, or
88 per cent of tho total tax revenues,
all of which was dovotcd to tho
causo of education. It will bo seen
thoroforo, that tho tax rovenues mado
a. not yield for general stato purposes
of only $375,000. Tho fees from
other sources, Increased this fund to
approximately $1,500,000."
In commenting on tho nbovo the
state auditor In a lotter to a private
citizen of Logan under dato of Oc
tobor 20, 1014, says: "I prepared
thoso figures nnd havo slnco ro
checked them, thoreforo know them
to bo nccurato." In replying to this
will my friend, Schoolman and Tax
payer, kindly havo tho sourco of
his authority, Supt. Larsen, go on
record ns to tho accuracy of his
statements. Further It is a fact
that many of your readers will re
call occasions wherein tho governor
of tho stato has mado tho statement
in public addresses, that moro than
80 per cent of tho tax rovenues of
tho stato goes to tho causo of edu
cation. In fact it is so common that
ovarybody Is beginning to knowt It,
and no ono seems to question It ox;
cept tho "schoolmen."
Tho "schoolmen" apparently seem
to think that tho so called public
schools is tho only avonuo for educa
tion in tho stato. They thought so
at tho recent session of the Utah
Educational Association, and on Do
cembor 20, 1015, this association do-
