HUGHES CLEARLY LEADING
IN MICHIGAN RETURNS
Detroit, Mich., Nov. 7. When one-third the voting precincts of
Michigan had filed their midnight report, Hughes was sharply in
creasing his lead over Wilson. Returns from 705 precincts, in 66
of 83 counties, gave Wilson 85,008 and Hughes 99,974. These re
turns did not include Detroit, where, at midnight, election officials
had not been able to start counting the presidential ballots.
WILSON WAS AHEAD
IN KANSAS EARLY RETURNS
Kansas City, Nov. 8. With about a quarter of the state heard
from, President Wilson had a lead of 5,274 votes at 2 o'clock this
morning over Charles E. Hughes, in one of the closest election
races the state of Kansas has ever known.

BY A WIDER MARGIN
Senator Page and Congress
men Greene and Dale
All Re-elected
It
Appeared at that Hour
That it Would be a Close
Election and the Official
Counts May be Necessary
to Determine the Result.
New York, Nov. 8. Early this morning Democratic Chairman
McCormick was claiming at least 268 votes for President Wilson in
the electoral college, and Republican Chairman Willcox claimed 301.
Each wasdaiming the doubtful states. Kentucky, Kansas, Mon
tana, Nebraska, and Washington, on the face of early returns were
leaning toward President Wilson. Maryland seemed almost cer
tainly Democratic. Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia, Arizona and
Delaware were leaning toward Hughes.
Chairman McCormick, however, claimed the president would
have a majority of two votes in the electoral college without carry
ing California, Indiana, North and South Dakota, West Virginia, or
Wisconsin, from which returns were far from complete but show
ing a Republican trend.
The early morning returns came in slowly. As the hours dragged
on, it became increasingly evident that it would be a close election,
and there appeared possibilities that in some places official counts
might be necessary to determine the result.
At 3 o'clock this morning, Vance McCormick, chairman of the
Democratic national committee, issued the following statement:
"We've got 'em ! Wilson's vote is rolling every minute. Wilson will
have close to 300 votes in the electoral college."
The following telegram was received early this morning by Mr.
McCormick from United States Senator H. F. Hollis of New Hamp- j
shire: "Returns from country districts give Hughes 24,114 and
Wilson 24,219 more than half of the state figures. Strong Demo
cratic cities to be heard from. Predict you will carry New Hamp
shire by 2,000."
It was announced at Democratic headquarters that Democratic
leaders all over the country had been notified to "sit tight" that
the fight had been won for Wilson, according to the best informa
tion received at headquarters.
It was announced early this morning at headquarters that Wil
son would receive 291 electoral votes and Hughes 240. This state
ment, it was said, was based on figures sent to the Democratic com
mittee from all parts of the country.
INDICATED HUGHES PLURALITY
IN INDIANA IS 15,000
Indianapolis, Ind., Nov. 7. Hughes' early lead in Indiana was
cut down somewhat as later reports were received, and, according
to returns up to 1 o'clock, with 1.475 of the 3,142 precincts in the
state heard from, the lead was 7,994. If the present ratio contin
ues, however, Hughes will have a plurality of about 15,000.
Republican State Chairman Will Hayes shortly after midnight
issued a statement claiming that Hughes would have a plurality of
50,000 in Indiana.
KEYES CHOSEN GOVERNOR
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
Manchester, N. II., Nov. 8. With approximately 105 precincts
out of 294 in the state heard from, it was certain early to-day that
New Hampshire had gone for Charles E. Hughes by a plurality of
5,000.
Henry W. Keyes of North Haverhill (Rep.) was elected governor
by a majority over John C. Hutchins (Dem.) of between 10,000
and 12.000.
In the first congressional district, Congressman Cyrus A. Sullo
way of Manchester (Rep.) defeated Gordon Woodbury (Dem.) by
about 1,500. Congressman Edward H. Wason of Nashua (Rep.)
was also returned to the national House from the second district
over Raymond Stevens (Dem.)
