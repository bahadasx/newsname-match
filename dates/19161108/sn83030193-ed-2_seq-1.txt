Common Stock Goes Up to
126, Highest in History,
But Closes 124 1-4.
After five hours of election excite
ment nml cnnrtitou.4 speculation to
day the Stock Kxrhungv ended n
two-null! m-sh.l'c M'KWm without n
boom or a breult. All day Wall Street
vnn a whirlwind of doubt. Moth
brokers and quotations gyrated up and
down and swung back and forth,
swayed by alternating hopes and fenra
and thi) shifting news from doubtful
States.
Kvery hour there was rise and full
of prices between extremes of three
to five point. Kneh upward climb
was followed by a tumble. Ten min
utes beforo tho close there was a dip
Into tho lowest level of the day, but
In tho last few minutes stocks climbed
rapidly up the scale again. V. S.
Steel led the freakish van. Its low
was 121 '., high 12G and close lSlH,
Trading is tho largest for several
weeks, sales totaling 2,099,000 shares.
Tho rapid fluctuations of prices ro-n
fleotc". the shifting of political opin
ion rather than Intrinsic values. Stock
Exchange quotations wero as blind as
the ' 1 ' out on the. Itnmd Street
Curb, whero brokers shouted many
offers and made a few actual wagers
reckless whether WlNon or Hughes.
In tho midnight cafes, when Hugh' s
was supposed to havo been safely
elected, thcro was predicted a wild,
booming opening of the Stock Kx
change In tho morning, but beforn tho
gong sounded at 10 o'clock enthu
slaim wan oozing, and tho expocted
orgy of speculative celebration be
came a hesitation.
Professional players of the giuno on
the ground in Now York hastened to
cancel their buying ordors and
perched themselves around tho edgo
like hawks ready to swoop In for rich
pickings whlchover way tho tide
turned. Hut tho public was not so
wary. From the West, that undo

pikers pourltu their new wealth Into

tart tho'makot off with a semblance
of a rise.
Not In many a day has thero been
such a scene of running, racing,

GUARD THE BALLOl BOXES!

In 1876 the Republican National Committee stole a Presidential election.
In 1884 the Republican National Committee tried to steal a Presidential election.
Aake sure that the Republican National Committee does not steal a Presidential election in 1916.
The Republican organization has relied upon the brute power of money to win this election. The
grqat Hughes majorities have been won in the States in which .the Republican leaders poured their
vast corruption funds and no where else.
We believe that President Wilson has won this election if there is an honest count. The supreme
duty of all Democrats in every close and doubtful State is to make sure that there is an honest count.
Guard the ballot boxes.
The Presidency must not be stolen.

The nbovo was tho reply of Colonel
E. M. Houso, President Wilson's clos
est frlond and advisor, when ho was
locnted this afternoon, after having
been in seclusion since opening of the
polls.
"Prosldont Wilson has not only been
re-elected, but ho will enrry Califor

well as Now Hampshire," Colonel
Houso added. "I make this statement
on tho basis of that sixth sense which
any man who has dabbled In politics

HOLDS
BY MARGIN OF 7,000 VOTES
ON THE LATEST RETURNS
f
California and W. Va. Close, Wilson
Cutting: the Hughes Lead in Both
StatesHughes Sure of Only 230
Votes Steps Taken by Demo
crats to Guard Ballots in Close
States.
With definite returns at hand apparently bulwarking 268
Democratic electoral votes, the Demooratio National Committee
is so sure that Woodrow Wilson has been re-elected President,
that plans were perfected to-day to safeguard the ballots int
the States favoring Wilson where the vote Is close. United
States Attorney General Gregory conferred this afternoon with
National Chairman Vance McCormlck over the situation In New,
Hampshire, New Mexico and other doubtful States from which1
reports of a sinister nature have reached headquarters.
George E. Farrand, Chairman of the New Hampshire Dem
ocratic State Committee, telephoned to National Headquarters
that the vote in his State has been counted and Wilson carries
the State by 200. He added that a Protective Committee has
been formed to guard the ballot boxes.
Although the returns, viewed without bias, show 268 elec
toral votes for Wilson, Chairman McCormick Issued a statement
late this afternoon claiming 300 electoral votes. He said he
based his claim on confidential reports from doubtful States and
intimated that as the returns came under official scrutiny some
States now conceded by the newspapers to Hughes may be
found in the Wilson column.
Minnesota, the corner stone of the Wilson strength, with her twelve
electoral votes, gave nothing but 'encouragement to the Democratic Na
tional Committee as the returns from the country districts began to come
in this afternoon.
RIVAL CLAIMS IN MINNESOTA.
Chairman Willcox, on information received from F. D. Kellogg of
Minneapolis, State Chairman of Minnesota, claims the State. But, late
this afternoon, with all the cities in and about half the rural district re
turns reported, Wilson still maintained a lead in the State of 7,053. His
lead had been cut down by Hughes, but if Hughes does not gain at a1
much higher rate of percentage Wilson will carry the State easily.
Fred Lynch, the Democratic National Committeeman from Minne
sota, has claimed all through the campaign that the Scandinavian farmers,
normally solidly Republican, are overwhelmingly for Wilson this year.
If Wilson can hold Minnesota he cannot be dislodged on the face
of t'ne returns and wins with what he has now by a margin of two
electoral votes. Hut as the returns began to freshen up this afternoon
doubtful States which had a Hughes trend in the morning began to lean
toward Wilson.
Indiana, for instance, cut down the Hughes lead with every return
that came in, and with half the State reporting Hughes's lead was only
ti),355 at i o'clock this afternoon. This is a dangerous margin Int
Indiana considering the way the Wilson strength has been developing
through the day.
CWSi; VOTK IN WEST VIRGINIA.
Wet Virginia, which, viewed from the standpoint of the returns,
was headed toward the Hughes column at noon, took a turn this after
noon. With about half the districts in, West Virginia shows but 600
