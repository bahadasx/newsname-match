Although National Chairman Willcox, at Republican headquarters, declined
concede that President Wilson had been re-elected, he was not ns positive in
; claims regarding the election of Mr. Hughes as the morning woro on. Ho

"J, am hopeful that when the complete returns are available it will bo shown

Frank H, Hitchcock, Cornelius N. Bliss, George W. Perkins and other
