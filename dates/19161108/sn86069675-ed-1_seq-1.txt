CHARLES E. HUGHES.
g a, i.i. -
At an early hour this morning
(2:30) the Associated Press refus
ed to make n prediction ns to
.whether the Democratic or Repub
lican ticket was the winner. From
"flie Tiesl information we have been
able to get up until going to press
at 7:30, the result is still in doubt
with Indiana and several of the
western states holding the balance
of power. According to the latest
tabulation Hugh&s needed 50 elec
toral votes while Wilson lacked on
ly 34.
Democratic ' Campaign Committee

The Democratio National Cam
paign Committee is claiming the
election of Mr. Wilson by between
10 and 30 electoral votes and a sig
nificant feature h that the Repub
lican hoadquartors have refused to
issui a statement binco 2 a. in.
Courier-Journal Claims Victory.
Wo have been advised that the
Louisville Courier-Journal will
claim thfe election of Mr. Wilson in
its issue of today. We have made
cffnrtH to get. in cnmmuniratnn wth
several of tho large papers in Ohio
and Indana but have been unable
to do so.
The Lexington Herald is of tho
opinion that Wilson has a good
chanco to be returned the winner.
Latest information from Ohio U
to tho eect that Wilson has carried
it by moro than 40,000.
Thero were many surprises in
tho election, one of them being Ken
tucky which the Republicans have
Keen claiming by 9,000 or more, at
tho Democratic headquarters at an
early hour this morning, it was
stated that Kentucky would go in
the neighborhood of 20,000 for WiU

earnestly to put the grand old Com
monwealth back, beyond any ques
tion, safely in the Democratic fold.
Whitman, Republican, was elect
ed Governor of New York and
Hughes carried the state by a largo
majority. In Ohio it looks like Cox,
the Democratic candidate for Gov
ernor, has been elected and that the
Buckeye btato will cast its electoral
voto for Wilson .with Pomerenc re
turned to tho Senate. Indiana is
reported to bo especially close and
that possibly the official count will
be required before it can bo deter
mined who carried the Iloosier
state. Tho grand old solid south
gave its usual Democratic majority.
Connecticut while going Republican
is said to havq gone only by a small
majority. Pennvlvania gave Hughes
a largo majority. Illinois is nlo in
tho Republican column. Tho v om
en voters in that state wero a great
disappointment to tho Democratic
party who expected to get the
greater percentage of that largo
voto but from tho meager returns
received it seems that tho women
followed tho lead of their husbands
and voted the Republican ticket.
The returns have been received
but from very few or tho western
states. California is in tho Repub
lican column while Colorado went
Democratic as did Nebraska, Wil
son is leading in South Dakota.
THE LATEST
A telephone message received by
tho writer at 7:30 this morning
from llio Cincinnati Enquirer says
tho result is in doubt, with the re
sult exceedingly close.
Tho New York World and New
York Tribune in extras lit 4:30 this
morning claim the election of Wil
eon. Tlio New York Herald says
will require the official count.
The New York Sun snys Hughes;
Brooklyn Eagle claims Hughes. The
New York American says the result
is in doubt but favors Wilon.
New York World and Tribune says
exceedingly close. This informa
tion came direct to us from the
Cincinnati Enquirer at the above
named hour.
Montgomery county Democrats
are jubilant over the splendid ma
jority of 510 received by Wilson
and 500 for Congressman Fields
and Chairman Judy and his co
workers are to be congratulated
upon this splendid showing. The
Dond Issue of .1-15,000 for the pur
chase of a Poor Farm mid which
required a two-thirds majority was
badly defeated. Thi.s was a non
partisan measure but the people re
jected same.
One especially commendable fea
ture of tho election was that neith
er side in this county resorted to
the u?e of money or whiskey and
the election passed off quietly and
orderly. We heard of no trouble,
of any kind whatever. if
Election returns were received at
the Tabb Theatre and wero also
flashed on the Trimble building.
