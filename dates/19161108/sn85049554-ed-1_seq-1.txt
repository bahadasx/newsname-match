[By Associated Press.]
Des Moines, Nov. 8.—Latest re
turns today from Iowa did not tend to
upset indications ,cf the ballot count
of last night givlhg the stale to
Hughes by an estimated plurality of
75,000 and to Harding for governor by
1-25,000. The rest of the "republican
state ticket was elected by large mar
gins.
The congressional delegation from
Iowa probably will be unchanged, it
appearing that Congressman Steele
had been re-elected.
Owing to the bitter light on the wet
and dry issue there were many local
upsets. In Des Moines, the home of
Meredith, democratic candidate for
governor, a plurality was given for
Wilson, but at the same time was car
ried by Harding, .while some demo
cratic counties gave a two to one vote
for Harding, who carried Hughes with
him.
The retu-rrfs are coming in slowly. It
appear!^that Iowa was the only atate
west of the, illaslssippi able to give a
definite resultAan hoar^. after the pails
closed.
Steele May Be Beaten.
The counting of the vote ih the
Eleventh district progressed slowly" to
day and D. C. Scott, republican, tem
porarily at least, passed Congressman
Steele, on the face of returns from 87
out of 279 precincts, having 7.078 votes
tp Steele's 7,021.
•Complete returns today from all the
thirty-two .precincts in 'Clinton county
give 'Meredith 3,326 Harding, 6,4o9.
Clinton county is normally a very close
county. It went idemocratic on gov
ernor two years ago.
The complete returns for attorney
general give Clarkson 3,463, Havner,
5,243.
Muscatine county complete gives
Wilson 2,560, Hughes 3,907.
Evans and Deemer Lead.
•Indications are that Justices Deemer
and Evans have been re-elected, qltho
returns are meagel*.
'Returns from 1,087 precincts for gov
ernor, out of 2,297 in the state', .give
Harding 151,019 and Meredith, 90.'555.
If this ratio continues thruout the state
Harding will have a plurality of 128,fi32.

republicans, wblch reduces the demo»
cratlc majority to five. Two demo
cratic districts In New Jersey are in
doubt, which, if reversed will reduce
the majority to one.
LaVe returns from Ohio, lndksattn*
the re-election of Senator Pomerenat
democrat, over Myron T. Herrick, re
publican, virtually ended the possibil
ity of republican ascendancy in the
senate. With democratic leaders in
sisting that Hltchoock, in Nebraska,
and Pittman, in Nevada, re-elected,
and with Kenrick probably elected in
Wyoming, the political status of the
new senate would tlhus be: Democrats,
52 republicans, 42, with the result in
Arizona and New Mexico still In doubt.
Should the republicans carry both, the
democratic majority in the senate
would be eight,

Dakota, Nebraska and Montana—said
Mr. Stewart.
