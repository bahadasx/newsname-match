'WILSON S ELECTION SEEMS SURE
CLAIMS 10,000
>BDT IS SURE
OF HALF THAT
Gov. Lister has been re-elected. This
is confidently announced at the democratic
headquarters here, and his lead over Henry
Mcßride, republican, is placed at 10,000 by
them. It is safe to assume, however, that
Lister has won by at least half that plurality.
Lister leads in King county with 2,000
votes, 2,000 in Pierce county, 1,500 in Spo
kane, 1,500 in Walla Walla county, and a
slight lead in the rest of the state. This may
be overcome somewhat by more complete
from the southwest, where Mcßride
lis leading.
Gov. Lister's election is one of the big
gest surprises of the election in this state. Up
to the time the polls closed, Mcßride was a
two to one favorite. It was an even money
bet that Mcßride would win by 25,000.
