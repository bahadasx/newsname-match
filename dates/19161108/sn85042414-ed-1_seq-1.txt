WESTERN STATES
ARE THE BALANCE
Democrats are Making the
Largest Boast of Final
Success.
Chicago, Nov., 8.'—After receiving
the latest returns from' the .party
leaders in a number of doubtful states
in the middle west and far west by
long distance telephone toda, Alvin
Hert, manager of the western Repub
lican headquarter*, claimed Hughes
and Fairbanks had carried Indiana,
North Dakota, California and. Minne
sota, and the Republican national
ticket had won wlta at least 272 elec
toral votes, six moro than the required
number.
"1 am certain Hughes and Pair
banks won, although the race appear*
close, "said Mr. Hert
"I talked with Cnester H. Howell,
Republican state chairman of Cali
fornia this morning, ,and he said tat
had received returns frO'rti
"every coun
ty in the fctate that HughM bas won
In C&llfornla by about 10,000.
"In Indiana leaders with whom I
talked assured me the Republicans
had carried the state by 10,000. In
Minnesota Republican leaders are
certain Hughes carried the state by
20,000.
"I also received assurance from
Republicans In a position to know
that North Dakota is absolutely safe
for Hughes.
"Counting the electoral votes of
these states Hughes will have 272, or
six more than the necessary 266. In
addition to these, which we are cer
tain of we have strong hopes of win
ning in Missouri and Oregon, where
the vote is exceedingly close. You
will And complete, returns, from these
doubtful -states confirm information
I have received."
The Democratic Boast.
Chicago, Nov. 8.—Senator Thomas
J. Walsh, manager of the western
Democratic headquarters, declared at
noon he was positive President Wilson
had been re-elected by at least S04
electoral votes, or S8 more' than the
number required.
He had received reports from party
leaders in«svery doubtful state in the
western territory this morning. After
tabulating these latest figures he de
clared Wilson would surely carry
these western states:
Montana, Utah, Colorado, Nevada,
New Mexico, Nebraska, Idaho, Ari
zona, Washington, Missouri, Kansas,
Minnesota, California, Wyoming and
North Dakota.
"Complete returns show Wilson
carried a majority of western states
which elect him with 304 electoral
votes," said Senator Walsh, "In
some of these states the vote Is close
but the latest reports show we have
won. I have been confident all along.
The early reports from a number of
western states were misleading. As
the returns from these states come In
our*claims are. being confirmed In
every Important respect."

New York, Nov. 8.—After a night
of excited shifting of states from one
column to another and resulting
claims and counter claims both the
national committee chairmen appear
ed confident during the forenoon that
the ultimate returns would return vic
tory to their banners. Each Issued
a statement before noon as follows:

AWOKE TO FIND
DIE WEST WAS
IN TIE SADDLE
New York Went to Bed sure
Hughes Was Elected on
East Landslide.
New .York, Nov. |.—When the Re
publican landslide in New York be
came known early last night It was
quickly followed by heavy Republican
victories in New England, and' there
was a vertiable stampede to announce
the election of Hughes and the de
feat of President Wilson.
Hundreds of thousands waiting in
the streets saw the signal lights flash
the defeat of the president. The New
York Times and other 'papers which
had been prominent in their support
of him, conceded the president's de
feat before some western states had
'been heard from.
Thousands of persons in the east
went to bed believing Hughes was
elected, and woke up thlr morning
to find the result apparently changed
while they slept. Hundreds who
made their plans for what they ex
pected would happen In Wall street
today found themselves all awry.
The first figures of Wilson majori
ties throughout the west did not
shake the confidence. of those who
predicting the election, of Hughes and
not until a steady stream of Wilson
majorities began eating Into the
Hughes columns piled up in the east
did any of them suspect the result
was In danger.
At midnight it was apparent the
free predictions of a sweeping Repub
lican victory throughout the country
were being contradicted py results
from the west- A» every ^our saw
the Hughes lead' melting It became
clear the president was not defeated
so easily and at daylight, without any
decisive result, It .'became apparent
the 'battle was being fought out In the
doubtful states with the advantage de
cidedly In favor of Wilson.

HUGHES PULLS
UP WELL IN
MINNESOTA
Rival Districts are Cutting
Down Wilson's Early
Lead.
St. Paul, Nov. 8.—Rural districts
returns this afternoon cut down Wil
son's lead over Hughes in Minnesota,
1,029 of 3,024 precincts giving Wil
son 92,066, Hughes 83,144.
In precincts outside Minneapolis,
St. Paul and Duluth, Hughes showed
rapidly growing strength. In 691 of
these rural precincts Hughes 42,172,
Wilson 34,139.
Republican leaders expressed con
fidence that if this ratio should be
maintained giving their candidate a
plurality 10,000.
St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 8, 3 p. m.—
Further inroads into Wilson's lead in
Minnesota were made when half of
the total precincts reported this aft
ernoon—1,430 of 3,024 gave Wilson
111,173 Hughes, 103,690.
CALIFORNIA SLOW
BOTH SIDES CLAIM
A FAIR PLURALITY
San Francisco, Nov. 8.— Qwlng to
the exceptional length of the ballot,,
few precincts had been reported1- ifr
either San Francisco or Los Angeles
at 11 a. m. today and art the 'result
of the count-fn these two cities hinges
the outcome. In San Francisco it
was estimated Wilson would have a
majority of 20,000. Los Angeles re
turns Indicated that Hughes' major
ity would not be as heavy as Repub
lican leaders had estimated.
U. S. SENATE
TO DEMOCRATS
Republicans Apparently
Have Failed to Overcome
Majority.
New York, Nov. 8.—Late returns
from Ohio indicating the re-election
of Senator Atlee Pomerene, Democrat,
over Myron T. Herrlck, Republican,
virtually ended the possibility of Re
publicans ascendary in the U. S. sen
ate.
With the Democratic leaders insist
ing that Hitchcock in Nebraska and
Pittman in Nevada were re-elected,
and with Kendrick probably elected in
Wyoming, the political status of the
new senate Is thus:
Democrats 62, Republicans 42, with
results in Arizona and New Mexico
still doubtful, should the Republi
cans carry both, the Democratic ma
jority in the senate will be eight.
Practically complete returns show
ed the Democrats certainly have lost
four United States senators, one each
In Maine, New York, New Jersey and
Maryland, while they gained one each
in Rhode Island, Delaware and Utah.
Indications pointed strongly to fur
ther Democratic losses of two sen
ators in Indiana, one in West Virginia
and Arizona and possibly one In Ohio
and Montana.
To offset these the election of Re
publican senators in Wyoming and
New Mexico had not been assured. If
the Republicans and Democrats
should lose all these as indicated the
senate still will remain Democratic
by two—49 Democrats to 47 Repub
licans. The Democratic majority at
present in the senate Is 16.
With forty-nine congressional dis
tricts to be heard from late today, re
turns for the next house Bhow 193
Democrats, 189 Republicans two Pro
gressives, one Socallst and one Inde
pendent have been elected.
Of the. 49 missing, districts, ther*
are 30 Democrats, 18 Republicans and
one Independent in the pr«sent
house.
Prohibition Defeated

San Francisco. Nov. 8-—Governor
Hiram W. Johnson, Republican-Pro
gresslv* candidate for United States
senator, had a commanding lead over
his Democratic opponent, Geo. S. Hat
ton, and It is believed his- majority
would approximate 200,000.
The prohibition amendihents have

column this morning, when returns

President Wilson's lead. Democrats
claimed the state by a comfortable
margin and this afternoon, despite the
big swing, .towards Hughes,. are not
conceding North Dakota electors to
the Republicans.

POSSIBILITY Of A RECOUNT
OR DECISION OF RESULT BY
HOUSE Of REPRESENTATIVES
New York, Nov. 8.—"President Wilson is abso
lutely re-elected," said Democratic Chairman McCor
mick at 4 o'clock this afternoon. "The Republicans
can't beat him by any combination of states that may
ensue. We can lose Minnesota and California and
still re-elect the president, but we feel confident we will
carry both states."
New York, Nov. 8.—The Republican national head
quarters statement late this afternoon claimed Minne
sota,' Oregon, California and New Hampshire and as
serted Hughes had obtained 277 electoral votes.
San Francisco, Nov. 8.-—O. K. Cushing, chairman
of the Democratic state central committee, claimed
California for Wilson by 10,000. Chester H. Rowell,.
chairman Republican state central committee, reiterat
ed his statement that Hughes would carry the state
by at least 6,000 votes.
New York, Nov. 8.—Chairman Willcox of the Re
publican National Committee at 1 p. m. o'clock issued
this statement:
"California and Minnesota are surely for Hughes.
This means Hughes is elected."
The statement, he said, was based in advices from
the respective state headquarters claiming California
by 10,000 Minnesota by 20,000. Chester H. Rowell
telegraphed from San Francisco Republicans could
concede everything the Democrats claim and still car
ry the state by 6,000.
NEW HAMPSHIRE IS VERY CLOSE.
Manchester, N. H., Nov. 8.—While the Republican
state committee had announced that with 21 precincts still
to be heard from Hughes had an unofficial plurality of 1,
867, revised newspaper figures this afternoon reduced
Hughes' lead to 275 with eleven small precincts missing.
Republican leaders said the unreported vote was in Re
publican territory and Hughes would carry the state by
400.
New York, Nov. 8.—With a decided drift toward the
re-election of President Wilson the result of the election is
still officially in doubt today.
Upon a dozen doubtful states from which returns are
coming slowly depends whether Wilson has been re-elected
or Hughes will be the next president of the United States.
The chairmen of both national committees claimed a
majority in the electoral college, but the actual figures
made good the claims of neither.
Aside from the uncertainty of the result the most re
markable thing was the sudden wiping out of Hughes' ma
jorities piled up in the east by returns from the west.
Not since the days of the revision of the returns that
seated Grover Cleveland in the contest of 1892, has the
country been compelled to wait so long to know the result.
Over twelve hours after the polls closed, Wilson and Hugh
es are running a neck-and-neck race in 12 doubtful states.
Wilson is reasonably certain of 232 votes in the elector
al college, and the same returns pointed to 218 for Hughes,
with 81 votes doubtful and 266 being needed for an elec
tion, the states in doubt are being watched closely.
These states with 81 votes include California, Idaho,
Indiana, Kansas, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon,
Washington and West Virginia.
EITHER ONE CAN WIN YET.
There seemed no doubt that Wilson had carried Ala-i
bama, Arizona, Arkainsas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Ken
tucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Mont-Ff^
ana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota,:^
Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah^t
and Virginia.
In the Hughes column were counted Connecticut, Illi
nois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey,!
New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota^"
Vermont and Wisconcsin.
