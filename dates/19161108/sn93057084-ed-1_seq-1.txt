THE "CHUMP."
I sometimes think how wrong it
is that man should let that mind of
his lie dead or half asleep while he
pursues his journey gropingly.
He's hedged about with rules and
lavrs expressed in words that crack
bis jaws, yet never does he ques
tion why the laws were made un
less some guy, like me for instance,
joggles him to take a hunch to get
the vim to reason back to how it
came these laws were made that lie
along the route of trade, and how
they came to take a twist that slap
ped him on the naked wrist. Just
think, without the laws at all what
would protect us from the gall of
them that come to board with us
and criticize and make a fuss and
never come across on time to
give the kids a half a dime. They'd
eha&e you off your own front stoop
and you might call and rant and
whoop, it would'nt do no good at
all, no use with them that have the
gall. But with the law in blue and
brass you tell those stiffs to go to
grass.—[Inland Printer.
800D ROAD WORK
The Onlda Watchman gives the follow
ing account of good roads enterprise in
our neighbor county (Sully) on the south:
The three new county graders
arrived last week accompanied by
J. I. Overholt of Sioux Falls, who
will remain in charge and assist in
operating them until they are ac
cepted bjT the the county commis
sioners.
One of the smaller machines has
been put to work in Commissioner
Eckert's district and the other is to
be taken over into Commissioner
Crawford's district, and if men
and teams can be found to run them
both will be able to. grade a good
many miles of road before snow
flies.
The large machine, pulled by the
engine belonging to tne Anderson
Bros, of Agar, with H. D. Yeager
as operator, has been put to work
on the long grade between the Dil
lon and Brandt places on the road
between this place and Agar.
The machine does very good work
and under ordinary circumstances
jwill finish a mile of grade a day.'
If engines can be secured, ic is the
intention of the commissioners to
keep this machine busy until the
weather gets too cold to work and
the grading this fall will probably
be confined principally to the main
north and south road running from
the Potter county line on the north
?to the Black and Yellow Trail on
the South.
Rev. H. L. Burleson has accept
ed the appointment as missionary
bishop of South Dakota following
unanimous confirmation in the
house of deputies, and consecration
-will ocour at the cathedral in New
.York city on December 14. The
convention of the Protestant
Episcopal church at St. Louis also
passed a canon under which South
Dakota trill secure a second bishop
undoubtedly toithin one year. Such
second bishop will be known as a
missionary suffragan.
A.H. Bane, who for the past two
.years has been living on what is
called the Davy ranch in Norfolk
township, has concluded to remain
there permanantly, and last week
bought the entire tract, something
oyer 13oO acres, from Messrs Davy
ETwert and Ketch urn, of Pierre the
fprtber owners. This makes Mr.
Bane owner of one of the best
ranches this side of the Missouri
rjver.—Onida Watchman.
