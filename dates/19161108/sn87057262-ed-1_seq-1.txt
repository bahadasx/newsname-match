Francisco returns would more than
overcome this lead of Governor
Hughes.
On the basis of these returns and
the opposite opinions of the outcome
in thiB state expressed by the repub
lican and democratic state chairmen
it was clear that California was not
alone a pivotal state, but an extreme*
ly doubtful one.
After repeated Canvasses ot the
t«te by telephone during the woo
sma' hours. Republican Chairman
Rowell and Democratic Chairman
Cushing declared at daylight that
they would stick by their midnight
predictions for California. At that
hour each claimed the state by 15,
4Q0 Vhe republicans said they be
lieved Hughes could lose Sah Fran
cisco county and still win in tho
Golden state.
Cushing, on the other hand, reiter
ated his belief that Wilson had swept
San Francisco with a sufficient plu
rality to more than nullify any plu
rality Hughes might poll in southern
California.
The general belief here seems to
be that neither candidate woald cap
ture this state by more than 5,000
and that it will take the complete ie
turns to decide the issue.
Aside from the presidency, princi
pal Interest In California centered on
the prohibition amendments. Returns
on these, which are meager, indicated
a victory for the wets. At wet head
quarters It wus estimated that prohi
bition had begn beaten four to one,
although in other quarters the vote
was put considerably under that
ratio.
Governor Johnson ran far ahead of
his ticket and has been elected Unit
ed States senator by a huge plural
ity. Some republicans estimated it at
nearly 250,000.
N'HJW YORK, Nov. 8.—Secretary
McAdoo at democratic headquarters
received a telegram from the state
headquarters in California declaring
that while returns are oomlng in slow
ly, it "appears practically certain Cali
fornia will go to Wilson."
SAN FRANCISCO, Norv. 8.—-Presi

2,195 scattered precincts, most of them

the first half of the county's precincts
he will carry the county by 12,000.
