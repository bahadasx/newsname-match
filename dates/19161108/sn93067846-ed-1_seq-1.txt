Information received by the de?

the last three months approximately
60,000 negroes have been transported
from certain Southern States to North?
ern and Western States, mainly to
Middle Western States, particularly,
Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. Investiga?
tion has developed the fact that a
number of these negroes have regis?
tered in violation of the laws of tho
State to which they have gone ar.d
have expressed the intention of voting
in these States.
"Some information has been devel?
oped indicating plans in different
states to violate the federal statutes
with reference to election In other
ways, such as registration of non
naturalized citizens; false registration
by padding the registration lists with
fictitious names with the intention of
having persons falsely represent
themselves to he the persons whose
namos appear on the lists and vote un?
der these names; what are commonly
known as "repeaters," false counts
and returns by election boards; enter?
ing on the poll books as having voted
fictitious persons or persons who have
failed to vote; intimidation in various
forms, including that by employers of
their employes, through threats which
tend to coerce tho will of the em?
ployes.
"Pacts in the possession of the de?
partment show in one city the pad?
ding of registration lists with fictitious
names: to an extent which in the light
of accurate Information already ob?
tained indicates that the number of
such false names probably reaches
into the thousnds."

Washington, Nov. 2.?Conclusive
evidence as to whether Germany vio?

in the sinking apparently without
warning of the British freighter Ma?
rina, with the loss of six American
lives is not expected by the state de?
partment before the latter part of next

Washington if anything final were ex?

a week was expected to elapse before
full evidence would be at hand.
Even though all information de?

former reports regarding the num

steamship Marina and the names of
those lost have now been cleared up.
In addition to the five Americans
reported yesterday as having been
lost, the name of Buie, given In earlier
advices as Brue, is added to the list
of dead. The name of Middletown,

Atlantic narrowly escaped running her
down, it was learned tonight Ac?
cording to the Atlantic's ddpper, the
near accident was due to a mistake In
reading the code signal lights. The 1
dredger, which was off Eastern Point,
made out the lights of the submer?
sible, which was coming r early head
on. The Atlantic kept or its course,
expecting the Deutschlard to steer
outside. When she did no: the Atlan
i
tic swerved to one side and slowed
her engines down, passing the
Deutschland with about 100 yards to
spare.
The manifest of the Deutschlands
cargo was tiled at the custom house
here late yesterday but it will not be
made public for some time, officials
of the Eastern Forwarding company
said. Unloading began this afternon,

The boxes wen >f various sizes, the

Olanta, Nov. 2.?Saturday night
about 10 o'clock when passenger train
No. 5 from Alcolu to Olanta was
about five miles south of Olanta the
engineer says he felt a shock from
the train having run over some ob?
ject which he supposed to be a pile
of slabs. The train was stopped and
on investigation it was found that
two negro men had been run over.
The bodies were about 20 feet from
each other, lying on oppoeite rails,
each with his head on the outside of
the track and feet on the inside of
track. The wheels had passed over
their bodies just below the shoulders
crushing every bone, but nor severing
the bodies. Conductor Floyd imme?
diately notified the head of the Alco?
lu railroad at Alcolu who notified the
coroner of Clarendon county. The in?
quest was held Sunday morning, the
verdict of the jury being that the ne?
groes came to their death by being
run over by passenger train No. 6. A
special train was run from here Sun?
day morning to the scene of the
Killing when about 200 citizens went
down to view the bodies and attend?
ed the inquest. The negroes killed
were Pringle Burgess and Leonard
Gasklns of near Scranton. They were
seen in Turbcville .about two miles
from the sceen of the killing, Satur
j day afternoon.
The opinion of the majority of
those who viewed the bodies is that
they were murdered and then placed
upon the railroad track to c^ver up
the crime. It is said that there was
very little blood found wnere the
bodies lav en the track, and mem?
bers of the train crew say that the
feet of these negroes were cold when
they found them. It is almost certain
that the railroad company will not
accept the verdict of the inquest Sun?
day, and that farther inve: tlcation
a ill be made.
