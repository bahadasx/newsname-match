loses all but two of the counties' in
the state, containing the larger cit­
ies. Thirty-six '^pr^cincts in Cass

Hughes 1,914. and Wilson 2,001. For­

Election Plays Queer Pranks.
North Dakota played some queer
pranks in this election. Wilson prov­
ed much stronger than John Burke,
and Senator McCumber ran far ahead
of Hughes. The big vote rolled up
by Wilson did not assist John Burke,

Hughes Loses All But Two Counties.
North Dakota swung into the Hughes columns as complete
returns from counties were obtainable. There were no more
changes in any of the other contests. Casey and Steen are run­
ning close, but Ca3ey running strong in rural vote, his election
seems certain. The Non-Partisan League judiciary candidates
are piling up a big lead. Latest figures on the leading contests
give Hughes 37,986, Wilson 37,-529.

DICKINSON NORMAL
SEEMS TO HAVE WON
BY BIG VOTE
Only meagre returns can be given
on the various constitutional amend­
ments. but those available show a big
vote for the Dickinson normal school
which seems to forecast a victory for
the Stark county city. The Slope went
almost unanimous. Owing to the heavy
vote, some precincts in the rural dis­
tricts will not have their complete re­
turns in until this evening.
The bootlegger law which was sub­
mitted is not likely to be held up, up­
on the face of early tabulations. The
Non-Partisan league supporters will
probably be able to prevent the repeal
of the bill levy for terminal elevator.
No returns are available on the
amendment establishing another in­
sane asylum.
SCATTERED RETURNS
Helena, Mont., Nov. 7.—At 9 o'clock
scattered returns from small precincts
in Montana indicated that Wilson has
carried the state, and that Sam V.
Stewart, Democratic, incumbent has
been re-elected Governor over Frank

majority.

With Oregon, Minnesota, California and Indiana
shifting toward Hughes representing a total electoral
vote of 268. Conceding Wilson the balance of the doubt­
ful vote, or 15, his vote is 253. But returns from the
seven doubtful states as listed are incomplete and it is
not safe to hazard a prediction exeept that Hughes is
gaining. Later reports may shoot the pendulum back.
It is the closest election since Hayes and Tilden and it
may be midnight before the Associated Press can flash
the name of the President-elect.
St. Paul, Nov. 8.—Hughes has slight lead in Oregon, one«
eighth of total precincts giving Hughes 13,923, Wilson 13,338.
