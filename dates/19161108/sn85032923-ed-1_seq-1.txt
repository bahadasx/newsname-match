FIFTY-THIRD YEAR
ELECTION CLOSE WITH HUGHES IN THE LEAD
Republicans Claim More
Than Enough Electoral
Votes To Elect Candidate
Democrats Refuse To Concede Defeat, Still Hoping That
New York Will With Aid Of Western States
Pull Them Out Of The Hole;
Wilson Sanguine.
NEW YORK, (Wednesday), Nov. 8. Early this morning Democratic Chairman McCormick is
claiming at least 268 votes for President Wilson in the electoral college. Republican Chairman Will
cox claimed 301. Each is claiming Kentucky, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska and Washington. Missouri,
Indiana, West Virginia and Delaware are leaning toward Hughes.
Chairman McCormick, however, claimed the president will have a majority of two votes in the
electoral college without carrying California, Indiana, North or South Dakota, West Virginia or Wiscon
sin from which returns are far from complete but showing a Republican trend.. Early morning returns
came slowly. The managers of both parties are anxiously watching Ohio and both are claiming the vic
tory there. As the hours dragged on it became more and more evident that it would be a close elec
tion and there appeared possibilities that in some places it might be necessary to resort to official
counts to determine the result
CINCINNATI, (Wednesday), Nov. 8. President Wilson had a lead of almost 10.000 votes over
Hughes at 1 o'clock this morning. At that time 2,289 precincts of the 5,570 in Ohio had been counted
and Wilson had 200,661 votes to 190,192 for Hughes.
LONG BRANCH, Nov. 8. At 3:40 Secretary Tumulty stated: "We claim the election of Presi
dent Wilson by 10 to 30 electoral votes. We will get West Virginia, Minnesota, Kansas and California.
ST. PAUL, Nov. 7. One-tenth of Minnesota gave Wilson a 4,000 lead, mostly city returns. Re
publicans claimed the rural vote will turn the tide to Hughes. The Democrats maintained the ratio
will continue.
PORTLAND, Ore., Nov. 7. Incomplete scattered figures from various parts of the State gave
Hughes 8,957, Wilson 8,209.
CHARLESTON, Nov. 7. Nearly one-fourth of West Virginia gave Hughes 34,618, Wilson 31,362.
... MANCHESTER, Nov. 7. With 14 precincts missing Hughes' prnrafity?!n New Hampshire is re
duced to 2,500.
NEW YORK, Nov. 8. Hughes, Republican, carried New York State by 100,000, the returns
showed at 2 o'clock this morning, with only 426 districts missing out ol 5,807. His total at that hour was
832,095, compared with 728,995 for Wilson. Governor Whitman's lead over Samuel Seabury, Democrat,
with 851 districts lacking, was 124,711. Wm. M. Calder, apparently defeated Wm. F. McCombs, Demo
cratic candidate for United States senator.
SEATTLE, Nov. 8. Both sides claimed Washington shortly after midnight, the Democrats set
ting their figures much higher than the Republicans.
At Democratic State headquarters, Geo. E. Ryan, secretary of the Wilson non-partisan commit
tee, said: "We consider Washington safe for Wilson by between'20,000 and 30,000 plurality and also be
lieve Governor Lister has been re-elected by 5,000."
F .C. Harper, chairman of the Republican State central committee, said: "We think Hughes
will pull through in Washington by about 5,000 plurality. We can lose King county, (Seattle) by 5,000
and still win, according to meagre reports we have received from other parts of the State. The indications
are that we will elect former Governor Henry McBride governor by a small majority.
NEW YORK, Nov. 8. At 3o'clock -this morning, McCormick was greatly more optimistic with
regards to Wilson's chances, saying, Wilson would receive 291 electoral votes as against 240 for
Hughes. Democratic committees from all parts of the country, said McCormick furnished figures on
which his deduction was based. "We've got 'em," said McCormick in his statement Wilson's vote is
growing every minute."
At Republican headquarters Chairman Willcox said he did not desire to change previous estimates.
WILMINGTON, Nov. 8. Late figures from three counties of Delaware give the State to Hughes
by from 600 to 1,000 plurality. Late returns indicate that Walcott, Democrat, defeated Dupont for
United States senator.
FARGO, Nov. 8. The Hughes' lead over Wilson in North Dakota crumbled early today with be
lated returns from the rural sections turning the tide in the president's favor. With about a third of the
total precincts reported the count stood, Wilson 19,670, Hughes 19,639.
ALBUQUERQUE, Nov. 8. With returns from precincts widely scattered it was uncertain
midnight whether the Republicans or Democrats carried the State.
at
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 8. Over half of Missouri gave Hughes 202,796, Wilson 215,706.
NEW HAVEN, Nov. 8. Connecticut with nine towns missing gives Hughes 102,266, Wilson 97,147.
KANSAS CITY, Nov. 8. One-third of Kansas gave Wilson 4,000 plurality.
LOUISVILLE, Nov. 8. Practically complete returns from ten out of eleven congressional dis
tricts gave Wilson 33,000 plurality.
SEATTLE, Nov. 8. One-third of the State gave Hughes 6,000 plurality.
NEW YORK, Nov. 8. Soon after midnight the Republican National Committee officially claimed
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Main , Maryland, Massachusetts, Mich
igan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin, which makes a total of 284 elec
toral votes, 18 more than are needed.
Vance McCormick, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, stated: "We do not con
cede Hughes' election by any means. President Wilson can still win with the votes of the States from
which we have heard nothing. All the Western States are to be heard from and they are all for Wilson.
We have given up New York. The indications are we have lost New Jersey. The indications are we
still hold Massachusetts. Kansas, Delaware and Maryland appear safe.
McCormick claimed Wilson elected with 270 electoral votes.

NEW YORK, Nov. 7. Returns from New York at midnight though still incomplete indicated
the election of Hughes and Fairbanks but the figures are close and Democratic managers steadfastly re
fused to concede a Republican victory although the metropolitan newspapers which supported Wilson,
conceded his defeat Democratic managsrs insisted on complete returns from west of the river, which
steadily seemed to be piling up the Hughes column. "Remember 1892," was the prediction of the
Democratic publicity bureau which recalled the memorable contest and the next day's revised returns
which placed Cleveland in the White House.
LONG BRANCH, Nov. 7. President Wilson went to bed at 12:30 while his managers were claim
ing his election. The president left word to be awakened if any really definite returns are received.
FARGO, Nov. 7. Hughes carried North Dakota by 10,000, according to midnight returns.
NEW YORK, Nov. 7. Hughes and his family received returns at his headquarters in an up-town
hotel. The nominee was asleep when the first returns were received. He arose at 6:30 and smiled when
handed the announcement of the New York newspapers that he had caried New York by 150,000 plu
rality. He ordered the first dinner at which his entire family has been present in months, but neglected
it for a time when the volume of returns increased. At 9 o'clock Mrs. Hughes and daughters congratu
lated the nominee on his election.
Thousands with brass bands gathered at his hotel and requested Hughes to appear. He expressed
appreciation and said he did not wish to appear until the result was demonstrated beyond a doubt The
crowd dispersed.

complexion of the next house and senate. No effort was made to conceal the fact that the outlook was
