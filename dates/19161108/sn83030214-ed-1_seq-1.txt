Hughes Ahead in Michi?

President 10.000
[Bt Tf!'*r.r.h to Th* Tribune. 1
Cleveland, Nov. 7.?While Democratic
State Headquarters ifl certain Wilson
hai carried Ohio by 100,000, big Repub?
lican gains in Cincinnati and the fail?
ure of Democrats to count heavily in
Cleveland caused Republican leaders to
declare that Hughes had a chance to
carry the state.
Wilson will carr.* Cleveland by',
20,000, it is estimated, while in Toledo'
his plurality will be about 5,000. Akron J
furnished a Wilson plurality placed at .
5,000, but Republicans declare that the
rural vote, wfcich ha* not been heard
from, will more than offset the Demo?
cratic pluralities in larger citiee.
Hughes, they add, will win in Ohio by j
a small plurality.
Democrata had fignred on carrying
Cleveland by 30,000, while it was e.ti- ,
mated that Hughes would get only '
18,000 plurality in Cincinnati. Repub?
lican gain. in the Southern Ohio city
and Demoerat losses in Cleveland may
swing the state for Hughes.
Ohio broke away from the Republi?
can column for tho tirst time four .
years ago, giving all twenty-four elec?
toral votes to Wilson. With the excep
tion of one vote for Cleveland, in 1892,
the state had been Republican since
1868. The 1912 vote was: Wilson,
423.152; Taft, 277,06*>; Roosevelt, 229,
327.
At 2.15 o'clock thi. morning, the
Cleveland Leader telephoned the Tn
bune that Ohio, was for Hughes by
from fourteen to 17,000.
At that hour, with half the state in
including such centers as Cleveland
aad Columbus and part of Cincinnati.
Wilson had a lead of 6,600, part of the
state to be heard from includes the
heaviest Republican districts, which
are expected to return from 20,000 to
23.000 for Mr. Hughea.
The reelection of Governor Willis i.
claimed by "The Leader" by 40.000. It
efltinatai the majority Ot ex-Ambassa
dor Myron T. Herrick for the Senate
at not less than 35,000, and probably
40,000.
ILLINOIS GIVES HUGHES
PLURALITY OF 250,000
His Lead May Exceed Taft's
1904 Record
IBv T?sTtrh Xo Ths Trlbunt ]
Chicago, Nov. 7. Illinois has j.:one to
Hughes by a plurality that may reach
the Taft 1914 record of 304,000. Returns '
now indicate that the Hughes lead in
the state will not be les*. that 2,'>0,000.
As more figures arrive the margin for
the Republican candidate increase*.
This i. due largely to the fact that the
great Republican pluralities were de?
livered in the precincts where the num?
ber of voters was tremendous.
Mr. Hachafl earriad Caak Caaatj by
not less taaa 20,994, and his indicated
majority ovi-r the President in the 101
countit-s outside of Cook is 220,90*3 He
won most of the women's vote as well
as the men's, both in Cook County and
thfl down state. The bi'; railroad
centres and the heavy ma.iufacturing
eities all went to him, while Bgncult
ural eountie* through the corn belt
were Republican witnout n murmur.
South* rn Illinois. the Republican cita
del, was solid for the Hughes electors.
President Wilson made no jrains in any
of the downstate, except for a .-mail
increase around Caatialia where
William Jehnings Bryan made a per
sonel appeal to boyhood friends. The
spactactular feature of the Illinois re?
sults was the mapniticent work of the
women.

MAJORITY OF 17
REPRESENTATIVES
Capture 226 Seats and
Overturn Democratic
Lead of 21
A small but safe Republican
majority in the House of Rcpresent
atives an_ ? narrow Democratic
margin in the Senate, which may
casily be wiped out in the later re?
turns, was indicated at 2 o'clock this
morning.
The Republicans appeared to have
226 seats, a majority of just 17
as compared with the present Demo?
cratic majority of 21.
Foor Behind in Senate
As the battle for the Senate stood
at 1:30, the Democrats had fifty
eeats, and the Republicans forty-six.
The biggest surprise was the indi
tation that rockribbed Republican
Rhode Island had elected a Demo?
erat, Peter Goelet Gerry, in place of
Senator Lippitt.
The defeat of Senator Sutherland,
Republican, of Utah, and the prob?
able defeat of Senator du Pont, of
Delaware, with the Rhoda Island
surprise, offset the Republican gains
of one each in New York, New Jer?
sey, Ohio, Nebraska and two in Ind?
iana. On the other hand, Senator
Clarence D. Clark, of Wyoming,
whose defeat had been feared by the
Republicans because of the strength
of Governor John B. Kendrick, was
reelected.
Granting the defeat of David J.
Lewis in Maryland and the election of
Republican Candidate France, the
Democrats had a majority of four in
the Senate.
Deniea Republican Victory
Senator Willard Saulsbury, chairman
of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, gave out the following
statement at 12:15 o'clock this morn?
ing:
"The Republicans' claim that they
will control the United States Senate
is absurd. Returns received by us up
to this hour indicate the loss of only
two Democratic Senators and a gain of
four. This does not include the Demo?
cratic Senator in Indiana where the
result is still in doubt."
The defeat of Senator Sutherland
was a purticularly bitter blow becau.e
of his recognired ability. He wa. re
gardel by his colleagues on both *>ide?
as one of the ablest men in the Sen?
ate and was a tower of .trength to the
Foreign Relations Committee, which
had been sadly weakened since the days
of Kacon, Root, Cullom, Shively and
Clarke.

Another example of an isolated
Democratic victory was in the 10th
North (arolina Distriet, one of the few
Republ.can distriet. in the Solid

President in Spite of Hughes Majorities
East of the Mississippi
At 4 o'clock this morning Charles E. Hughes, Republican
candidate for President, was leading President Wilson in a
close race.
The midnight calculations giving Hughes an electoral vote
of 291 suffered later revisions which made his certain total
262. This estimate removed from the Hughes column and
placed temporarily, at least, in the doubtful column the states
of California, Idaho, North Dakota and Washington.
Earlier figures made lt appear almost certain that the
Republican ticket would get many more votes than that num?
ber, but changes and shifts and later revisions up to 3 o'clock
this morning made it impossible to predict a more definite
result.
These revisions removed some states earlier counted for
Hughes from the Republican column and placed them tem?
porarily at least in the doubtful list.
At 3 o'clock this morning, the final outcome was stilj*
doubtful in the following states: Ohio, Kansas, Montana, Ne
vada, Delaware and Washington, having a total electoral vote
of 51. On this basis, President Wilson seemed to have carried
enough states to insure his getting at least 199 votes in the
Electoral College.
Ohio wavered between the two candidates. At 3 o'clock
this morning, however, "The Cleveland Leader" telephoned The
New York Tribune that half the state's vote, including the large
Democratic cities, gave Wilson a lead of only 6,500 votes. At
the same time "The Leader" was claiming Ohio for Hughes by
17,000 and State Chairman Hatfield telephoned National Repub ?
lican Chairman Willcox that the state would give Hughes a ma?
jority of 20,000 votes.
Minnesota's city vote indicated a Wilson vietory in that

'Estimated
state, but more complete returns
from the rural diatrieta seemed like?
ly to offset the President's lead and
to indicate a majority for Hughes of
15,000. Kansas was still running .1
neck and neck race, with Hughes
rlightly in the lead, and Delaware
was leaning to Wilson by the small
margin of 500 votea.
Although it did not appear likely
that Hughes would lose any mate?
rial suport aa the retuma became
more and more complete, the later
fig-ures did show an unmistakable
lessening of the margin of victory in
many of the statea that early in the
night were counted for Hughea by
large majorities.
New Jersey, President Witeon'a
home state, gave Hughea one of tha
biggest relative majorities of all the
states in the Union. The returns up
to 2 o'clock indicated that Hughes
would carry the state by 30,000
Hughea Carriea Big Statea
The big outstanding feature of tho
returns was the fact that the Repub?
lican candidate carried the states
that have the big electoral vote, ex
cepting only Ohio. Mr. Wilson ap
pears to have increased the Demo?
cratic strength of the Bryan cam?
paign of 1908, but the Democratic
hopes of getting a large alice of the
Progressive vote of 15*12 met with
crushing disappointment not only in
the Kast, but in Indiana, Illinois and
Ohio. At the outside the D?mocrat_
did not get more than 20 per cent on
the average of the Progressive vote
of four years ago.
The swing to Hughes began early,
when New York gave the Republican
candidate a lead that will probably
mount up to a state majority over
Wilson of 11*0.000 votes. New York
("ity, which had been counted upon
to give the President about 7.1,00*4
more votes than Hughea, gave hirn
only 40.000, and the up-state Repub?
licans swept that aside with an over
whelming vote of D>0.000. The New
\ork plurality for Hughea practical
ly doubled his vote here eight jears
