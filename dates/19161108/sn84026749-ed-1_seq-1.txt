NEW YORK, Nov. 8. Upon the final tabulation of the vote in Cal
ifornia and Minnesota depends the choice of the American people for
President of the United States.
Woodrow Wilson was within ten votes at 2 o'clock this afternoon
of the whole number needed to insure his re-election and at that hour the
result in both California and Minnesota was in doubt.
If Wilson carries either State his re-election is practically assured.
If he carries both States there is no doubt of the result.
Minnesota returns indicate that Wilson will win there, but enough
doubt still exists to prevent the State being set down as certain for him.
Wilson is leading in California on the vote counted so far and
Democratic papers in California claim he has carried the State.
REPUBLICANS REITERATE HUGHES WINS.
On the other hand, the Republican national com-
I mittee at noon formally announced its claim -that

wiison naa iosi doui caiiiurnm miu mmuebuia wiui
their twenty-five votes.
At the time these conflicting claims were made
Wilson had 256 votes certain to his credit, while
Hughes had 238, leaving California 13; New Hamp
shire, 4; New Mexico, 3; Minnesota, 12, and Oregon,
5, as doubtful.
If Minnesota and California should both go for
Hughes he would have 263 votes, and would need only
the four votes of New Hampshire to win. The result
in New Hampshire is so close that an official count
may be necessary.
NEW MEXICO AND OREGON CLOSE.
New Mexico and Oregon are close also, but in
dications this afternoon are they have both gone
Democratic. These two States, however, would not
be sufficient to put Wilson across.
At 1:15 p. m. Vance McCormick, national chair
man of the Democratic party, reiterated his claim
that President Wilson had been re-elected by an
electoral vote of 288.
"I still'stand by my original claim of 288 elec
toral votes for President Wilson," hedeclared in his
statement. "The President has certainly and surely
been re-elected."
CLAIM NOT BORNE OUT.
McCormick's claim is not borne out by the returns
available at that hour. Telegrams from the Republican

NEW TORK, Nov. 8. There was
probably more excitement nt Demo
cratic and Republican headquarters
today than on any provlous "day
after."
As returns from doubtful Stntes
came In, literally in dribbles, tho ex
citement wnxed nnd waned with an
occasional flaro-up over all sorts of
rumors, regarding how thnt electoral
vote would finally bo counted.
Ono of theso rumors particularly
caused Joy at Democratic head
quarters just bofore noon, when It l
was handed around that President leaders in Minnesota to national headquarters declared that
Wilson's tally would bo 280. I T

MAKE COUNTER CLAIM.
The Democrats late today made a counter claim, to
offset Republican activity, by announcing West Virginia
as Democratic. This claim was ridculed by Rcpublcans.
Vance McCormick, chairman of the Democratic na
tional committee, made the claim that Wilson was re-elected
with 288 electoral votes. .
"It is useless," he said "for the Republicans to try to
bluff the people.mto believing that they have won the elec
tion." The afternoon papers are all guarded in their asser
tions. The Evening Sun giVes Hughes 242, Wilson 253,
