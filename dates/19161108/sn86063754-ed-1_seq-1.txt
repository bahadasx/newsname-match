Vol.7 NO. 8 PAGELAND, S. C., WEDNESDAY! MORNING, NOVEMBER 8. 1916 $1.00 per year
, Nation Dying of Hunger ^
While the people of the United
States have been sending
thirty million dollars* worth of
relief to Europe and Turkey, <
two hundred thousand women ^
and children in Albania have j
died of starvation.
While each woman and child
in Belgium has had plenty to '
eat, women and children in A1 j
bania have gnawed at the car- '
x casses of dead horses in the 1
streets. ]

from his third trip to this hunger !
zone of Europe, predicts that the 1
entire population of Albania will '
die of famine and pestilence un
less helped. He says that in 1
Albania corn is fifty dollars a
bushel, flour eighty dollars a
sack, and macaroni five dollars ;
a pound. (
"The tragedy of Albania,"
says Mr. Howard, "is that a nation
is dying of hunger, while
the people of the United States,
laden with gifts for the rest of
Europe and for Turkey, pass by
on the other side.
"Thirty millions of dollars
have been given by the people
of the United States for relief
work of various kinds in Belgium,
Poland, Armenia, Syria
and the warring countries of

thousand women and children
in Southeastern- Europe have
starved to death unheeded and
uncared for. Not one woman
or child has died of hunger in
Belgium; two hundred thousand
in Albania.
"Is it fair?is it human?that
the innocent women and children
ot Albania, who never did
anyone any harm, should be
trampled under foot and left to
perish, at a time when all others
are fed?
"Is this American fair play?
"I have appealed for help in
high places. I have begged a
crust of bread of those who have
given millions to Belgium, Poland,
Armenia and Syria.
i ne Albanians are as much I
entitled to sympathy and help as
others. They have not taken
part in the war. They fed and
sheltered the refugees from Scrvia,
even with the last measure
of corn that the famine smitten
villages possessed. They have
not done any wrong; yet armies
have swept over their country,
taking what could be found to
take, leaving to starving women
and children only the carcasses
of dead horses in the streets.
'I ask only American fair play
for the famished children of Albania.
I ask of all fair minded I
men and women in the TTnift?/ll
States: Why should the Alba
nians?three hundred thousand
of whom are Christians?be left
to starve, while we press forward,
in generous rivalry, to
feed the others? The Albanians
are more numerous than the Ar
menians; vet we feed the Arme
nians and let the Albanians
starve.
"Having appealed to deaf ears
in high places I now appeal to
the plain people?to fair minded
men and women who would not
let even a dog starve to death,
no matter what his breed. I
want to go back to Albania with
a shipload of food. I have arranged
for a snip?a new American
ship, just launched and fit
ted for sea. The ship is ready
and waiting.

gentlemen in New York?most

appeal for a relief cargo for the

Danger of Bad Teeth
Crooked, twisted, gnarled and
deformed teeth are a source of
danger to the child, family, and
state as well. Buck Teeth Ben
soon gets too sensitive to be in
touch with his playmates, and
ne stays in the background?getting
farther and farther away
from his fellows.
The child is in danger of being
a recluse, a backward. Den
tists are to be found all over the
land. Call on them.
In every state, in almost every
countv, vou will find people, so
cieties, calling the attention of
mother to the necessities of dental
cleanliness. Clean the teeth.
You will find that a clean tooth
never decays?vou will fir.d
dark spots on the teeth under
which lurk small germs that eat
holes in the teeth. Get a little
orris root ana a good brush and
nil) your teeth. Get a brush for
the hoy and one for the girl.
When you find the teeth and
gums sore, bleed, the teeth fall
into holes, the gums separate
from the teeth, blackspots on the
teeth inside and outside of jaw,
there is bacteria 011 the teeth.
If the teeth are in the last stage
of decay, see a dentist.
Don't wait until you have lost
your best teeth to look after
your mouth. Watch the boy's
and girl's mouth. Disease often
comes from decayed teeth.?

[jold Scattered Over the Streets 1
of Jefferson
Mr. L. E. Gardner in writing
to the Jeffersonian gives the following
interesting account of (
Kold mining projects near Jefler- ,
son: " ,
This gold mine wad discover- ,
ed bv Burwell Brewer, nearly ,
one hundred years ago. Mr. ]
Brewer, and his assistants got (
their gold by using log rockets
and sluice boxes, but in later ,
years a northern company got
in possession of the mine and
made their gold bv the hydraul
ic process. They were very ,
successful, so much so, that they
decided to work the mine r?n ct
larger scale. In 1889 the com
pany built a 40 stamp mill down
to the toot of the hill, on Fork
Creek and opened a quarry on
top of the hill and blasted out
the ore and it was conveyed to
the mill on a train of cars
through a tunnel 1300 feet long.
The stamp mill was put in operation
April 1890. The output
of gold for the first month, was
15 lbs. The mill didn't run
many years before the hard
pounded ore and poisonous gas
es and chemicals used at the mill
began to damage farm lands
along the creek below the mine.
The landowners sued the com
pany for damages and the mill
was shut down. The mine has
not been worked since except on
a small scale. The Northern
company sold the mine tract to
Mr. Bill U. Clyburn, of Kershaw
a few years ago. Mr. Clyburn
is the present owner. He has
considerable farming done on the
place, but no gold mining.
I believe this is one of thfe,
richest gold mines in South Car
olina. All that is needed is mon
ey, necessary machinery, and
plenty of will power to make the
Clyburn mine a paying proposition.
I am not an expert at gold
mining, but I've been a prospector
for several years. I use a pan
and pick for mv outfit and I find
some gold on every tract of land
in this neighborhood. In reference
to last weeks issue of the
Jelfersonian, I see that my name
is mentioned as a successful
prospector in John Miller's gold
mine. Now I wish to make some
explanation. It is a fact that a
darkey named John Miller, does
own several lots near the foot of
Brewer mine hill, and I have
panned a lot of dirt from an old
road, crossing his land and the
gold shows up good I've tried
it several times and the pros
pects for gold is encouraging.
I believe John Miller has a rich
mine over there, and I believe
it will pay to work the place.
There are several places near
Jefferson, that is rich in gold
deposits, and should be worked.
I can find small particles of
gold on the main street of Jefferson.
Why should we ever complain
of hard times when we
have gold under us and in our
fields, branches, and on every
hill top, and for all we've got it
we will need plenty of elbow
grease to get it in our pockets.

Deutschland Brings Ten Million
Worth of Dyes and Drugs
New London, Conn., Nov. 1.
I Ten million dollars' worth of
ivestuffs and drijgs and it
was said "possibly stocks, bonds
ind precious stones" comprise
the cargo of the German submaj
rine merchantman Deutschland,
according to a statement tonight
by Capt. Paul Koenig, commander
ot the craft.
The Deutschland is in this
port after having succeeded in
making a second voyage from a
German port to the American
coast, despite the watchfulness
of British and French war vessels.
First of the under>ea merchantmen
by use of which Ger
many hopes to keep open a
trade route with the United
States, the Deutschland, accord
ing to her captain, is at preseni
the only vessel of that fleet
The Bremen which started a
voyage from the city after whicl
she was named on August 26, lit
said, has been given up as lost
He thought "she must have
struck a mine," but he added
"she has not fallen victim to this
almost blockade. I am sure o
that."
The Amerika, which some re
ports have indicated was a mer
chant submarine captured by tht
British, never existed. Captair
Koenig asserted.
"I must keep up this traffic
alone for the present, that is, tin
Deutschland must," he said. "Ir
a fortnight I shall be gone,
hope, to return before the end o
the year." " It
was possible, the navigato
stated, that other merchant sub
marines would be built bv *ha
timeIn
a summary of his voyage
iust completed, Captain Koenig
who returned with decoration:
from German royalty as mark:
of recognition for his pioneei
voyage, said this was "a quie
trip." Recital of its incidents
however, developed matters o
lively interest. The Dcutsch
land did not lie on the ocear
floor this time, as in the voyagi
which ended at Baltimore las
July. The submarine insteat
vajied the monotony of its sail
ing under the water or on tin
surface with'occasional dodge:
beneath vessels identified a:
warships of belligerent Nation
ality or thought to he. Sevei
times, Captain Koenig said, In
maneuvered in this way. Tin
last time was off Nantucket ves

"The storms gave us mor<
trouble than this so called block

beset by heavy southwest gale
for days, and they were with u
most of the way across. Fog
also hindered us. We might a
well have been submerged, tin
weather was so thick at times.1
The superstructure of tin
Deutschland was dented bv tin
blows of the seas, but she suffer
ed no severe damage, her com
mander said.
