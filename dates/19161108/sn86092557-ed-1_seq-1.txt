HI SHIES I
MRECTED C?
Election in Marion County \
Polling Places bj
of Thiev
BOWEN AND BARNEif
[Transfers Which Were Han<
They Had Voted at t
Important Influ
It will bo days before the full ex- I
tent of the corruption and strong arm
muthods to which the Democrats resorted
will be known but tho story
of what occurred at two precincts In
this city is sufficient to show that the
election In Marlon county was deliberately
stolen.
Kearly in the day It became evident
that I he Gang had centered its effort
! upon ihe polling places near the June
lure of Quincy street and Maple avej
nue, the Miller school and the Hamilton
Warehouse and the Court House.
These are so situated that one canc
of thugs and corruption Ists can operato
at all of them at the same time
without much trouble.
The general manager of the political
Infamy was United States Marshal C.
E. Smith and he was actively, not to
say ably, assisted by an Italian pettifogger
named Abbatlcclilo. an Individ
ual named. Caldara who at one time
was some sort of a representative of
the Italian government in this neighborhood,
and now Is located some
where In. the east, and Arthur D.
Simon. A small mob of crude, but
willing workers, which included J. H.
Abbott and-Frank Fisher, a former Hepublican,
and some black thugs who
wero armed with sawed off billiard
cues and other weapons of that sort
served to fill up the ranks and help
to overawe the poor dupes who were
brought up and voted as though they
wore so many chattels. Finally there
waB Justice of the Peace Musgrove.
Musgrovo was one of the Important
links in the chain of election crime.
At tho beginning ho set up an office
under the roof of tho Miller school
whero he did a business of administering
oaths to men whom he admits
he knew perjuring themselves. He
was finally driven from that point
of vantage by Republicans who insisted
that the law be enforced, at least
to that extent, and then he placed his
table on the porch of the home of A.
D. Simon, which is near by and the
busy traffic In perjury and worse went
merrily on whilo the polls remained
open.
Abbaticchio was not so particular
cither as to his location or the way
in which he operated. One Italian
went to him as a countryman and as
a art of the routine of getting his
election papers fixed up handed over
his naturalization papers. After making
out the residence affidavit Abba
I tlccblo sought to tell the man how he
should vote and when he found out
that the voter Intended to Bupport the
Republican candidates he tore up the
affidavit?and the naturalization papers.
Nor was this the only raw performance
of this creature who does
not seem to respect any law. AH day
his place of business was surrounded
with a gang of falsifiers who have
been well trained by him and are willing
to perform practically any service
he may require.
At the polls mentioned between 100
and 150 Illegal votes were cast and
there la evidence to warrant the asser.
tlon that there was scarcely a precinct
In Fairmont district at which some Illegal
votes were not placed In the ballot
box, Indicating clearly that there
was a deliberate and thoroughly organized
plan to steal the election in
this county.
How well the conspirators understood
each other and were ablo. to
employ team work was shown many |
times daring the day at .the polling j
place In the court house. The principle
offence there was the open purchase
of votes hv Tom Tlevanv and
Deputy Sheriff Buckley who acted as
paymaster during the Intervals when
the bulky frame of Tom became wearled
with the ardous -task. But from
time to time colored workers at these
polls were seen to hand transfers to
colored voters after they had already
deposited ballots In the court houaj)
ballot box. It Is a fair assumption
that the blacks so heeled went to
some other polling place and voted
again. It Is a fact that up to noon
Monday County Clerk Martin had Issued
hundreds of these transfers. If
they were all used laithis way, they
of themselves would< ave been enough
to turn the election.
