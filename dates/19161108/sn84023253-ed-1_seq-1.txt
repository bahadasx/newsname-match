REV. MOODY'S WARNING
In Globe Service Says, "Backwash of
IMlly Sunday Meetings Will Be
Felt in St. Johnsbury.
A warning to "Get your house in
order" was sounded to St. Johnsbury
by the Rev. Paul D. Moody before t
large .congregation at the first of the
Sunday night meetings to be held this
year in the Globe theatre. In a pow
erful sermon in which Mr. Moody ex
pressed the belief that the "back
wash." from the Billy Sunday meet
ings to be held in Boston next week
would be felt here. lie also said that
the people of this vicinity were look
ing forward with expectancy ana
trepidation to the spiritual upheaval
in Boston and many were planning
for its effect here. .
Mr. Moody spoke from the text.
"Multitudes, multitudes, in the val
ley of decision, for the day of the
Lord is near, in the valley of decis
ion." He spoke of the preparation be
ing made in Boston in anticipation ot
the "good that Is bound to come and
the changes that will be made in the
lives of many in that city."
In following up the thought of its
effect on St. Johnsbury. Mr. Moody
touched on the civic and private mor
als of the town and said, "There is
much violation of law in this town.
many who are living lives of shame,
to say that St. Johnsbury is not as
bad as this or that town about the
state offers no excuse for the condi
tions that do exist. When we look at
these things ourselves we are apt to
overlook many things, but when wt
drag them out into the light and see
them as God sees them then we feel
things are not so well."
The speaker also referred to the
tri-centennial to be observed espec
ially by Congregational churches, ot
the landing of the Pilgrims, and spoke
of the many hardships they endured
in the pursuance of their faith and
the dangers encountered in the wil
derness, of how faithful the lathers
were in church attendance notwith
standing Indians and other dangers.
He made the statement that he
thought the automobile of the present
day was more of a hindrance to
church attendance than was the In
dian in the time of the Pilgrim. He
also said, not until the conditions be
come so bad and there is no voice to
offer protest will the need of St.
Johnsbury be realized, and asked for
divine aid to see things as God sees
them and not as they are seen by
men.
In closing he issued the warning to
St. Johnsbury and emprasized the
necessity for decision!
Mr. Moody will speak on many
texts of interest during the winter.

Elected Town Representative Over
The Republican Candidate By A
Yote of 806 to 761 Rest All
G. 0. P.-Record Vote Out
The state of New York has been carried for Hughes by a plurality
of more than 100,000. The indications are that he has also carried Il
linois and Indiana by a like plurality. 'The returns from Ohio are
insufficient to determine the result in that state. All of the New Eng
land states and New1 jersey as well as "Wisconsin and Michigan have
been removed from the list of doubtful states. Unless there is a land
slide for President "Wilson on the Pacific slope the election of Hughes
seems certain.
An early estimate of the Hughes electoral vote without Ohio
placed it at 277, eleven more than necessary for a majority in the
electoral college. The Hughes majority reported from Indiana and
(Continued on page five.)
VERMONT REMAINS
TRUE TO TRADITION '
AND SOLID G. 0. P.
Burlington, Nov. 7 Vermont re
mained true today to the tradition she
has consistently maintained since
1856 in giving her electoral votes to
the republican candidates for presi
dent and governor. In addition she
re-elected the three national legisla
tors. Senator Carroll S. Page and Con
gressmen Frank L. Greene and Porter
H. Dale. Hughes plurality over Wil
son, estimated on the basis of returns
from little more than half the tsate,
was about 20,000 and Horace F.
Graham, republican candidate for
governor, vanquished his democratic
rival, William B. Mayo, by a little
wider margin. Wilson was stronger
than his party in the state, polling
from 5,000 to 6,000 more votes than
were given to Mayo. Both Hughes
and Graham each received twice as
many votes as their respective oppon
ents. The republicans also elected
their complete state ticket as fol
lows: Lieutenant governor, Roger W.
Hulburd; treasurer, Walter F. Scott;
secretary of state, Guy W. Bailey;
auditor of accounts, Benjamin Gates;
attorney general, Herbert G. Barber.
An interesting feature of the returns
was the fact that Wilson carried 'St.
AUbans, where there is a large popu
lation of railroad employes. Th
legislature is overwhelmingly republican.
Electing Charles Whitney, Demo
crat, over Robert W. Simonds, Repub
lican, by a small majority, the voters
of St. Johnsbury handed republican
dope a severe Jolt at the polls yester
day. It was conceded by both parties
tfliat the fight would be hot and close,
but the size of the democratic vote
polled came as a surprise. It was
called more of a personal affair than
a party issue until the size of the
presidential vote became known. Poll
ing the largest vote In the town's his
tory, not only was the vote for re
presentative close, but Wilson car
ried nearly double the number of
votes that has ever been polled on the
Democratic ticket. The count stood
Hughes 895, Wilson 712. A small
scattering vote went to Ilanly, pro
hibition, and Benson, socialist.
On the representative Issue, out
wardly both sides expressed confidence
as to the outcome, but as three o'clock
approached there was hustling 1n both
camps to swing their supporters into
line. The democrats had been work
ing hard as election day approached
and although the republicans were
not over confident, going by the usual
democratic vote cast, a veering to
that quarter was hardly looked for.
As the count was made known, 806
to 761, Mr. Whitney's supporters gave
him a great ovation. He made a
short speech from the bandstand on
Court House square In which he sig
nified his Intention to Btand by the
workingmen of St. Johnsibury. He re
ferred to Mr. Simonds, In speaking
of the workman's compensation act
by saying that while possibly he was
not as capable as Mr. Simonds In con
struing the workmans compensation,
but he would promise to see that th
workingmen of St. Johnsbury did not
suffer by honoring him as representa
tive. The county and state officers polled
the usual vote In St. Johnsbury with
possibly a small gain in the democrat
ic column, but the republican ticket
held sway on about the same percent
age throughout. James Campbell, re
publican, polled 700 votes for state's
attorney to 390 for Harry Witters,
democrat. For governor almost the
same percentage held, Horace Gra
ham polling 1050 votes to 478 for
William B. Mayo, the democratlo
nominee.

A large crowd stood for hours In
front of the Caledonian office lasv
night listening to the election returns
given out as they were received ovei
the direct wire installed in the build
ing. The excellent service rendered
evidently gave satisfaction for not
withstanding the sharp cold air, large
groups of political fans remained un
ne small hours of morning.
As the early returns came in, a
veering in either direction was the
signal for loud cheers by the support-,
ers of that party. Later in the nighv
as the returns showed a heavy Hugh
es leaning the republicans remained
to see how large the G. O. P. vote
would be. while many of the demo- j
crats still hoped that some states on
the Pacific slope, voting late, would
start a landslide in Wilson's direction.
The republican headquarters in the
Y. M. C. A. building received the ser
vice from the Caledonian office over a
private telephone wire. Returns were
also supplied by messengers to the
Masons, who waited for results at
the Masonic temple.
Reception to Mr. nhitney.
St. Johnsbury people held their
reception to their representative-elect,
Charles N. Whitney, last evening. The
St. Johnsbury band headed a proces
sion formed at the Avenue House and
marched tothe home of James Cos
grove on Main street. It was estimat
ed that over 500 people passed the re
ceiving line, composed of Represonta-tlve-elect
Charles N. Whitney and
Mrs. Whitney, Mr. and Mrs. James
Cosgrove, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur P.
Young and Mr. and Mrs. Harry Wit
ters. Refreshments of punch were
served and cigars were at everyone's
disposal.
JUDGE STAFFORD'S LIXTIXKE
Holds Attention of Large Audienut; at
Grace Church.
The lecture, '"Bnakespeare, the
M;m," delivered by Judge Wendall
P. Stafford of Washington, In the as
sembly room of Grace Methodist Epis
copal church, held the intense Inter
est of a large audience from begin
ning to end. The election excitement
that prevailed was all that prevented
the attendance of an excptionally
large audience.
Judge Stafford dealt with his sub
ject in a most pleasing manner and
paid many tributes In the course of
his lecture to the man, Shakespeare.
The address was both interesting
and instructive and much credit Is
due Arthur F. Stone, who was Instru
mental in getting Judge Stafford here,
for supplying such a pleasant eve
ning's entertainment.
