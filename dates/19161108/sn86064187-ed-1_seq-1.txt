! SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 8. Three thousand
four hundred and fourteen precinct of 5,917 in Cali
fornia give Hughes 262,946, Wilton 252,993.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 8. Further inroad into
Wil on'i lead in Minnesota had been made by Hughes
when nearly half the total precincts of the state had
reported early this afternoon. In 1,439 of the 3,024
precincts Wilson polled 111,173 votes and Hughes
103,609.'
' 1' YOKK. Nov. 8. I'.oth republicans and democrat
continue to claim the presidency and as the count continues in.
the .seven states in w hich the decision must lie made, it is ap
'parent that one of the missing big states, California, Indiana
or .Minnesota, may le the deciding factor.
I Minnesota Considered Safe.
J Considering Minnesota as safely in the Wilson column, the
president would have 201 votes in the electoral college. He
; needs only five more votes to win.
Among the missing states are Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon
jand Wyoming, with a total of fifteen votes. Any two of theso
states will give Wilson the necessary votes. Wilson is leadinj?
i in the count in Idaho and Wyoming.
223 Almost Certain.
j Mr. Hughes has 22.1 almost certain votes. To he elected,
Hughes must carry California and Indiana, in which he has a
slight lead al present, and in addition, get nine out of the fif
teen votes out. This estimate is based on the assumption that
.Minnesota will go for Wilson.
If Wilson were to lose Minnesota, while Hughes won in
i California and Indiana, the president's outlook for re-election
would not be very bright. ,
As the sheet stands at 1 :.') o'clock he has a decided atU
vantage over Mr. Hughes.
Hughes Lead Wiped Out.
Aside from the uncertainty of the result the most remark
able thing about the election was the sudden wiping out of the
Hughes majorities piled up in the east by the returns coming
in from the west. When the republican landslide in New
York became known and whs quickly followed by the heavy
, republican victories in New England, there was a veritable
stampede to announce the election of Mr. Hughes and the
defeat of President Wilson.
Plana Set Awry.
i Hundreds of thousands waiting in the streets saw the nig
, nal lights flash the defeat of the president. New York news
papers, which have been prominent in their support of him,
conceded the president's defeat even before some of the west
ern states had been heard from. Thousands of people in the
east went to bed believing Mr. Hughes elected and awoke this
morning to find the result apparently changed while they slept.
Hundreds who made their plans for what they expected to
. happen in Wall street today had their plans set awry.
Confident Unshaken.
Tlie majorities of Wilson through the west did not shako the
confidi'iiee of thikse who were predicting the election of Mr. Ilughen
1 and not until the stoady stream of Wilson majorities lienn rating
i I Hughes columns piled up in the east did any nf tliein .suspect that tho
ii'sull was in danger.
Hughea Lend Melts Away.
At niiilniclit it w as apparent that the free predict ions of a sweep
ing republican victory throughout the country were being contra
i dieted hy the results front the west. As every hour saw the Hughes
'had melting down it. became char that the president was not to be
defeated so easily and then at daylight without any decisive rrsult
it became apparent that the battle was lining fought out in the doubt
ful slates w ith the advantage decidedly in favor of Mr, WiLon.
Neck and Neck.
Not since n next day's revision of the returns seated (trover
'"Cleveland in the contest of h!2
wait so long to know the result. More than twelve lioiira after the
polls had closed, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Hughes were, running neck
and neck in the race in doubtful states.
Congress returns were equally uncertain but on their face at
K a. in , today the republicans had not been able to overthrow the)
democratic majority although they did succeed in reducing it in the
house. In the senate the republicans appeared to have gained aeven
seats
