CHARLES EVANS HUGHES IS
ELECTED PRESIDENT OF U. S.
Republican National Committee Claim States That
Make a Total of 301 Electoral Votes for Hughes
McCORMICK CLAIMS AT
Democrats Assert That Returns From Western States Will
Show That Wilson is Elected Hughes Carried New
York State by Almost 100,000 Whitman Decisively De
feated Seabury for Governor and Calden Ran Away
Ahead of McCombs for United States Senator Vote for
Presidential Electors in Massachusetts Was Close, Re
publicans Leading by Some 12,000 Votes.
New York. Nov. 8. At an early hour
this morning Democratic Chairman
McCormick was claiming at least 268
votes for President Wilson in the elec.
toral college and Republican Chair
man Wilcox claimed 301.
Each was claiming- the doubtful
states, Kentucky, Kansas, Montana,
Nebraska and Washington on the face
of early returns were leaning to
ward President Wilson. Maryland
seemed almost certainly democratic.
Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia,
Arizona and Delaware were leaning
toward Hughes.
Chairman McCormick, however,
claimed the president could have a
majority of two votes in the electoral
college without carrying California, In
diana, orth and South Dakota, West
Virgiria or Wisconsin, rrom which re
turns were far from complete but
showing a republican trend. The
early morning returns came in slow.
Managers of both . parties were
anxiously watching Ohio and both
were claiming victory. As the hours
dragged on it became more and more
evident that it would be a close elec
tion and there appeared possibilities
that in some placet, it might be neces
sary to resort to official counts to de
termine the result.
Although the metropolitan newspa
pers which have supported President
Wilson conceded his defeat, the demo
cratic manngers insisted that, com
plete returns from the we wouM-reverse
the trend which steadily seem
ed to be piling up in the Hughes col
umn. "Remember 1.892" was the prediction
of the democratic publicity bureau
which pointed out that in that memo
rable contest the next day's revised
returns placed Grover Cleveland In the
iWhite House.
Soon after midnight the republican
national committee in an official
statement claimed Caliwnla, Connec
ticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, In
diana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massa
chusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, North Dako
ta, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Isl
and, South Dakota, Vermont,- Wash
ington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
That made a total of 281 electoral
votes, IS more than the necessary 266
for an election.
This was the first official indication
from the republicans that the result
would be so close.
The republican managers realized
that a sudden switch in the states in
complete or unheard from might in
crease the Wilson figures, but were
sure the later figures would add to the
states they were claiming.
When shown the list of states claim
ed by the republican national commit
tee, Robert W. Woolley, director of
publicity of the democratic national
committee, said that the claim of the
republicans was without foundation.
Mr. Woolley said that of the states
named Connecticut, Idaho, Delaware,
Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mi
chigan, North Dakota, Oregon, South
Dakota, Washington, West Virginia
and Wisconsin were, as near as demo
cratic reports showed, probably for
President Wilson. Of these states, Mr.
Woolley declared Delaware, West Vir
ginia, Maryland and Wisconsl nwere
certainly for Wilson and in all uther
states reports showed that Wilson was
leading.
Speaking for the democratic na
tional committee, Mr. Woolley claimed
the following states, having a total of
313 electoral votes: Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Dela
ware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kan
sas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Mon
tana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico,
North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia,
Washington, West Virginia and Wis
consin. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION .

date for United States senator in New

lead, with 1,833 districts missing, was
151.657.

Twelfth congressional district, but in
13 of the 15 election districts Leon
Sanders, democrat, led Meyer London,
socialist, by 43 votes.
Morris Hillquit, socialist candidate
for congress in the Tweitieth district,
apparently was decisively defeated.

be successful. .

Announced He Had Carried State.
New York, Nov. 7. Charles E.
Hughes and his family received the
election returns here tonight at the
uptown hotel which has been the re
publican nominee's headquarters since
nis nomination. .
When the early returnh becran to
come in Mr. Hughes was asleep. He
slept until, 6.30 o'clock. Meantine the
telegraph instruments in an adjoining
room had been clicking for two hours
and a sheaf of telegrams, showing the
trend in New York, were awaiting Mr.
nugnes- perusal. The first paper
handed to him told of an announce
ment by a New York newspaper that
ne had carried New York state hv
iau,uuu plurality. Mr. Hughes smiled.
Mrs. Hughes and their three daught
ers, the Misses Katherine, Elizabeth
and Helen, scanned the returns over
Mrs. Hughes shoulder. Presentlv
Charles E. Hughes, Jr., and his wife
and Dr. Colin S. Carter. Mrs. Hughes'
brother, joined the group. Dinner was
oraereti, the first In months at which
the entire family had been present.
Returns soon came in faster and the
uwjjiui was neglected ior a time to
read them. A tiuge electric sign
several blacks away which flashed the
returns from New York, divided the
family's attention with the telegraphic
reports. -rney lingered at dinner un
til late and the group in the corridor
opposite the telegraph room heard fre
quent outoursts of laughter.
Mrs. Hughes Congratulated Her Hus
band.
At 5 o'clock Mrs. Hughes coneratu
lated her husband on his election. She
told him-then that he had been elect
ed. Mr. Hughes' daughters also con
gratulated him. Mr. Hughes gave out
no statement.
Although President Wilson's secre
tary, at the summer White House, and
Chairman Vance McCormick of the
democratic national committee made
claims that the complete returns
would show the re-election of Presi
dent Wilson, the trend on the face of
the returns was toward Hughes and
early in tha evening some of the New
lork newspapers which have sun
ported President Wilson conceded his
defeat although they made no esti
mates in figures.
Democrats Concede Loss of New Eng
land.
Early in the evening a great majori.
ty for Hughes in New Yofk was evi
dent and the state was conceded by
ne democrats. boon afterward dem
tocratic supporters conceded the loss of
all Isew England.
An early estimate of the Hjjghes
electoral vote without Ohm, placed, it
-atrrTTreleWfr more than. necessary for
a majority in the electoral college. The
Hughes' majorities reported from In
diana and Illinois were regarded by
the republican leaders as an indica
tion of what might be expected from
the states further west when the fig
ures began coming in. The difference
in time and the fact that the polls in
some of the western states closed lat
er than in the east made figures early
in the evening impossible.
Democrats Lose in House.
Nothing definite as to the com
plexion of the next congress was avail
able early in the mgnt. The demo
cratic. majority in the house had been
decreased by one. It was conceded
that the majority in the senate had
been decreased by two one by the
republican victory in Main last Sep
tember and the other by the election
of William Calder from Xew York,
who defeated William McCombs.

pointment was generally expressed
but the president himself remained

Apparently the president was the

Philadelphia, Nov. 7. Pennsylvania,
which cast its electoral vote tor xheo
dore Roosevelt four years ago, today

dential column by giving Charles E.
Hughes a plurality, as indicated by
returns up to midnight, of about 200
000. Virtually all counties that were
normally in the republican column
prior to 1912 returned republican plu
ralities. Philadelphia early returns
Indicated a plurality in the city of at
least 75,000 for Hughes, and Pitts
burgh showed a substantial plurality
for the republican national ticket.

Rescued by Fire Boats and Tugs.
Boston. Nov. 7. The lives of from
thirty to fifty persons were lost to
night when a crowded passenger car of
the Boston Elevated Street Railway
plunged through an open drawbridge
into Fort .Point Channel, just outside
the South Station terminal.
Bodies Pinned in the Car.
Twelve other persons were rescued
from the water by fire boats and tugs.
One man, Thomas J. Gannon, died af
ter being brought to shore. Two bod
ies were found with grappling irons
but the recovery of other bodies was
delayed, as it was believed they were
pinnea in the car which rested on
the bottom of the channel, 35 feet
deep.
Motorman Jumped.
Gerald Walsh, motorman of the car.
who jumped before it went over the
edge of the draw, asserted that the ac
cident was due to the fact that there
was no light on the gates protecting
the opening. He and George McKeon,
the conductor, who also leaped and
so saved his life, were arrested on
technical charges of manslaughter.
The conductor was unconscious and
the police were unable to learn exact
ly the number of his passengers.
Forty Persons Unaccounted For.
Some of the rescued people esti
mated the number of passengers at
upwards of fifty.' J. Harvey White,
publicity agent of the Boston Elevated
Railroad, in a statement issued soon
after the accident, said his informa
tion agreed with that of the police
that about forty persons were unac
counted for.
Shortly before midnight 30 bodies
had been removed from the car and the
divers reported that there were others
that had not been brought to the sur
face.
