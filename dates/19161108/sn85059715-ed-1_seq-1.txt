showed the president to have received

These figures were from 1.120 of the .

SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 8.?Returns!
available early today indicated that the
eon test between Wilson and Hughes in i
California was so close that an official |
count might be necessary to determine j
the result. With 2,152 precincts in |
various parts of the state out of a total j
of 5.917 accounted for the president |
was leading by about 700 votes. Owing j
to the exceptional length of the ballot f
few precincts have been reported in j
either San Francisco or Los Angeles,
and on the result of the count in those
two cities hinges the outcome. In
San Francisco the city's register indicated
that Wilson would have a majority
of 20,000. Whether this would
overcome, the majority certain to bef
rolled up for Hughes in the southern j
California point.s was the point with j

By GEORGE V. BACON". ,t
I am in London, and it is more lfkc i
lie most impossible of all things, the, c
ealization of one's childhood dreams, t
han anything else I could compare it, 1
:o! The outstanding feature of the [ I
rast city to me is the forest of chim-! t
lev pots, -which our houses invariably |l
ack.
In America, we take a few square,
feet of ground and build straight yp
a far aa wrp dare ko on It. In En- i
eland men take plenty of ground to|
build on. and what the London build-,
In* lacks vertically. It gains horizontally.
All the traffic Roes to the left in-(
stead of to the right, and the great
red busses and rivers of taxlcahs trav-;
el at incredible speed. I have beer,
dodging In and nut like a veritable;
yokel.

me of a Kansas town In the Garden

"Chambers" and "Mansions."
As I have said, the buildings in I?n-1

than apartments are apartments. They |

such as. for example. Ilchcster;
Mansions. The great hotels, howev-r.
have a nomenclature that may he;
found multiplied many times over in
various American cities. There is one
rather odd difference. In America, the |
Savoy, for Instance, is always the "Hotel
Savoy." In London, on the toutrary.
it is the "Savoy hotel." which j
is much more sensible.
I am going to leave the discussion '
of London for a few minutes, how-1
ever, to order to return to Liverpool.
On the morning of arrival, the passengers
were required to file into the

reserved for the inquisition of aliens.
At one table. British subjects were
examined, at the others, aliens.
I tirst went up against a stern old
fellow who demanded my passport. I
gave it to him. He regarded It with
the expression of a man looking over
his wife's millinery bills.
I was then told to show what othei
papers I had with mc. 1 produced
them?quite a bundle, done up In at
elastic. The stern old chap took on<
look at them, gave me what a T>ondoi
cabby would term "a narsty look." ant

j Liverpool is strongly reminiscent of j

There Is no end of them. Whenever i

physical good looks the English women
are a match for them. In fact. I
cannot understand how thf men can;
he so pood looking. .and the general j

It Is impossible to admit, either, that'
the English women dress as well as)
ours. Taking them class by class a?'
one sees them, they lack in general j
the smartness which is the keynote
of the American girl. I am speaking
now, however, only of the cities of
Liverpool and London, the two places
in which so far I have been able to1
see them. While we are on an unpleas- j

how to make women's shoes, and until!
I the English women discover the trick
