CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 8. Prohibition
lias made great strides by yesterday V
election.
The manager of the national Prohi
bition campaign said today that "re
turn Indicate that Michigan, South
Dakota, Nebraska and Montana have
gone 'dry and we paved Arkansas
f) from going back into the 'wet' column.
"The election of Simon Bamberger,
running as Democrat-Progressive
for governor of Utah, is a factor fo;
us. He favors prohibition and this
means prohibition for the state by
statute."
Arkansas retained prohibition by a
vote of 2 to 1.
In Washington two initiative amend
ments to let down the bars in this dry
Ftate to intoxicating, liquors were
overwhelmingly defeated. One pro
posed the manufacture and sale of
beer to be delivered to consumers in
unbroken packages. The other pro
posed permitting the sale of liquor by
hotels to its guests.

. ments. No.' 2, has been t victoriously

clnts, the vote on Amendment-No. t
stands 144.298 against to 139,573 in

the states went in the voting for presidential electors yesterday. Eacn
state is put in the Republican, Democratic or doubtful column upon the
best information which has come' by telegraph. After each state is put
the number of the electoral votes it possesses.
These standings are likely to be changed at any time by late news, but
this is the situation as it stood at 1 o'clock this afternon in New York:
Ten states are in the doubtru! column. Of these, Hughes had a lead in
Indiana, New Hampshire, West Virginia and Oregon, with 32 votes, and if
he carries these he will have 253 votes. Wilson leads in Californ-'a and
Minnesota, with 25-votes, and If he carries these he should have 257. This
leaves 21 votes in the doubtful column on which there 13 no late news
Arizona; 3 votes: Maine,' 6 votes; Montana, 4 votes, and Nebraska, 8 votes.
Should Hughes get these he will have 274, or eight more than enough to
elect. If Wilson gets thete he will have 278 votes, or 12 more than enough
to elect. - ' ; ; -
