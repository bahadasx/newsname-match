Straggling returns this afternoon
fail to cut down the Wilson lead In
Kansas and final results will probably
show a Democrat presidential plural
ity of 20,000 to 25,000. Contrasted
with .hp landslide to President Wil
son, the state has given Governor Cap
per a majority of 100,000 to 125,000
over W. C. Lansdon, his Democrat op
ponent. The remainder of the state
ticket below governor is safely Re
publican by 3.1.000, to 50.000. Both
brnnches of the state legislature are
Republican.
More than half of the vote of the
state has been reported to Topeka,
Returns on the presidential contest
camp this afternoon from 1,449 of the
2.474 precincts of the state. In these
precincts Wilson has a lead of 13.233
votes over Hughes. These precincts

passed the 70,000 mark with more
than 1,000 precincts to hear from.
The governorship vote has been re

LEGISLATURE
OF 1917 TO BE
REPUBLICAN
Ninety Members of House of
Representatives Are G. O. P.
Thiiy-Two Senators Undoubt
edly Will Be Earned.
MAHIN AND JIM ORR BEATEN
Socialists Will Have Two or
Three House Members.
Latest Returns Assure Repub
lican Control Here.
Republicans will control both
branches of the state legislature. Re
turns today indicate that the Repub
licans have probably elected 90 of the
125 members of the house, and 32
members of the senate. Final returns
may change these figures, but in any
event it is quite certain that the Re
publicans will control both legislative
bodies.
Two men widely known in Kansas
political circles have seemingly been
defeated for the state senate. In the
Fortieth district, W. C. Whitney ap
pears to have beaten Senator I. M.
Mahin. In the Second district James
W. Orr. Democrat, was beaten for the
senate by Frank Pomeroy, Republican.
J. M. Davis, Democrat, was defeated
for re-election to the senate from
Bourbon county. Robert T. Barr won.
Reports have been sent to Topeka
from more than one-third of the dis
tricts of the state. They give Repub
licans strong leads in both houses. In
Crawford and Cherokee counties
strong efforts were made to elect
senators. Senator C. S. Huffman, Re
publican, seems to have won another
election in Cherokee. It is probable
that the Socialists will win two or
three members of the house from
southeastern counties.
Members of Both Houses.

THRONE TO CATHOLIC
New Ruler of Poland Will Be of the
Roman Faith.
Washington, Nov. 7. The king of
Poland will be a Catholic, it is de
clared on high authority here today.
The choice lies, it was said, between
the Austrian archduke and a Bavarian
prince.
Leopold of Bavaria, it was believed,
will be chosen, as he has two sons,
and his wife. Princess Gisela, is the
daughter of Emperor Franz Joseph of
Austria-Hungary. In her veins, it
was said, flows the blood of the an
cient kings of Poland, with whom the
house of Hapsburg formed a marriage
alliance.

candidate for governor, by 125,M.
The congressional delegation,, will
probably be unchanged. ' ' ,
Owing to a bitter state fight over pro

Vessel, 7,933 Tonnage.
London, Nov. 8. The Peninsular
& Oriental liner, Arabia, sunk by a
submarine, was torpedoed without
warning, the British admiralty an
nounced today. Two lives were lost
when the vessel went down.
The Arabia was torpedoed Monday
noon in the Mediterranean, the ad
miralty statement said. The Arabia
carried 437 passengers, the admiralty
statement said. They included 169
women and children. The passengers
were picked up by various vessels
which hurried to the scene and so far
as now known only two persons per
ished. The Arabia was last reported en
route to London from Sydney, South
Wales. She sailed from Adelaide, Oc
tober 5. The Arabia was a twin screw
steamer of 7,933 tons gross, was 499
feet long and fifty-four feet beam.
Altho the facts of the Arabia sinking
were known in London early yester
day, the censors would not permit
publication of them, it being presum
ably the government's purpose to
avoid even an appearance of attempt
to influence or sway the American
presidential election.
Officials hinted that they wanted
to eliminate any possible chance of it
affecting yesterday's balloting in
America, if the attack was made with
this in mind.

McAdoo Passes Out New Dimes
by Handfuls to Crowds.
New York, Nov. 8. Confined Joy
had no room at Democratic headquar
ters this afternoon. As the trend to
ward President Wilson grew more
strongly defined during the early aft
ernoon, the crowd in the Fifty-second
street building headquarters increased
in both noise and size.
By one o'clock the lid was ripped
off and thrown into the discard.
Just before the hour Chairman Mc
Cormick received from O. K- Cush
ing, California state chairman a tele
gram saying the Democrats out there
believed they had carried the stute.
Men and women stampeded for the
exits and led . by a hurriedly hired
baid, started toward Fifth Avenue,
where Republican headquarters are
located. '
The Democrats remembered the
serenade they got from their friends
the enemy Tuesday night when it
looked all Hughes. Secretary of the
Trtasury McAdoo was so delighted by
late returns that he suddenly started
passing out handfuls of the new
dimes.

There have been many crowds in
front of the State Journal building on
previous election nights, but never be
fore was the crowd so vast as it was
last evening. The returns came early
and the results were favorable for
Hughes and Capper at the start.
The State Journal piesented the elec

ment, and the crowd was kept busy
looking right and left with their eyes
and listening Intently with both ears.
' From one upper window Chas.
Crews, the auctioneer, read in a loud
voice that was heard to the utter
most parts of the throng.
J. B. Doncyson, with his machine,
wrote In an almost uncanny manner
the bulletins, his pencil on the ma
chine being repeated in letters and fig
ures on the sheet in front of him on
the State Journal building.
Lew Nathanson, on the opposite side
of the entrance, displayed other bul
letins, written with the typewriter on
films.
On the bulletin window were com
piled,, from tin e to time, total big fig
ures of the various candidates. Mean
while, telephones in the State Jour
nal office were busy all the time.
The State Journal issued a com
plete night extra at S o'clock,
ahead of all opposition, following ic
with another night extra, still more
comprehensive, issued at 9:15 and
ahead of any other paper. The laet
night edition indicating Wilson had
carried Kansas was the third night
