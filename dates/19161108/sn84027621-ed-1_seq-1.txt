WILSON GAINS IN WEST
New York, Nov. 8, 10:34 a. m.
Reports from Montana and Washing
ton said the indications were that Wil
son had carried those states by 10,000.
Wilson is leading in Kansas, Oregon,
New Mexico, Wyoming, Minnesota,
Idaho and California on the latest re
turns. , 1
TREND TOWARD, WILSON
New York, Nov. 8. The result of
the presidential election was still
doubtful at noon today. The result
depended oa the outcome in a dozen
doubtful states from which the re
turns are coming in slowly. The trend
is towards Wilson. .
". The chairmen of both national com
mittees claimed handsome majorities
in the electoral college for their candi
dates, but actual figures failed to
make good the claims of either.
Democratic Chairman McCormick at
11 o'clock gave out a statement claim
ing that Wilson would have 280 of
the electoral votes. He based his
statement on an official canvass in
pivotal states, he said. Wilson was
leading in Kansas by more than 11000
majority with about half the precincts
in and many rural counties not heard
from.
Delaware returns at 11 o'clock
showed that Hughes had carried the
state by 800.
. Indiana gave Hughes more than
10,000 majority with less than a thou
sand precincts out. . '
Wilson led in North Dakota by
slightly more than 900 votes with two
thirds of the precincts missing.
Hughes had about 9000 lead in Cali
fornia with more than 2500 precincts
missing.
Wilson led in Minnesota with about
one-fourth of the precincts in that
state reported, by nearly 10,000.
The states counted safely in the
Hughes column this morning were
Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maine,
Massachusetts, New , Jersey, New
, York, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
Vermont and Wisconsin.
The solid South and Arizona, Col
orado, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri,
Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio,
Oklahoma and Utah are for Wilson,

'RURAL VOTE FOR HUGHES
Rural returns in Minnesota de
creased Wilson'3 lead. The doubtful
states are still very close.
ANOTHER ESTIMATE
Western returns put Wilson in the
lead. The doubtful states look dem
ocratic on the face of returned receiv

REPUBLICAN GAIN IN CONGRESS
New York, Nov. 8. With seventy
six congressional districts to be heard
from .definitely, the republicans had
gained nineteen seats in the House
while the democrats had gained xten.
This reduced the present democratic
majority of twenty-three to five. The
doubtful democratic districts "in New
Jersey if carried by the republicans
would reduce this majority to one.
SENATE REMAINS DEMOCRATIC
New York, Nov. 8. Ohio returns in
dicating that Senator Pomerene has
been re-elected virtually f ended the
possibility of the republicans getting
a majority in the . Senate. With the
democrats insisting that the election
cf Hitchcock in Nebraska is assured,
Pittsman in Nevada re-elected and
Kendrick probably elected in Wyom

OCALA PEOPLE AWAITED THE
RESULT WITH THE GREAT
EST INTEREST
Up to a few years ago, the people
thought they were' lucky to receive
returns from a presidential election
next day, but since McKinley's second
election the results have been known
to all places in reach of the telegraph
and telephone in a few hours after
the polls closed. So when the Star
ordered bulletins from the Associated
Press," it confidently expected to be
able to tell the result by midnight if
not sooner.
Thi3 being, however, the most
closely contested election since 1884,
the returns varied as they came in
and when the wearied operators clos
ed their offices at 2 a. m. this morn
ing, the result was yet in doubt. -
The center of attraction was the
Star office, which was crowded till
midnight with anxious democrats who
earnestly perused ' the Associated
Press dispatches procured for their
information .at quite an expense
for a bobtailed daily. In addition to
reading and bulleting its dispatches
for the benefit of those present, the
paper steadily sent them out through
the county, every, telephone outside
Ocala, and many in ; town, probably
ailing the Star up at least once dm '
?ng the evening.
Over at the Court Pharmacy, an
other big crowd listened to Louis Du
val, who read out the I. N.. S. dis
patches secured by the firm through
the Postal for the enlightenment of
its friends. The Court Pharmacy
showed great enterprise, and its ac-
commodation was greatly appreciated.
A number of the Commercial Club
members met in the club rooms to
take the Western Union report, which
was a very full one. 5 Ed Bennett
came over and made a synopsis of the
Star's reports to give out at" the Tem
ple. The colored people received the
Western Union report at the Metro
politan theater.
