District By Large Majority.
The returns in the national
election indicates that the re?
sult is very close between l'resi
dv'iit Wilson, the democrat
candidate and Mr. Hughes, the
republican candidate, and it
may bo several days before the
final result is determined. The
lirst returns indicated that
Hughes was elected by a
large majority, but later the
democratic candidate commenc?
ed to gain and the result now
depends on some of the small
western stui.es claimed by the
republicans*, in which Wilson is
gaiuing rapidly and if he car?
ries them he will be elected.

The Community Bell
Wether
Every farmer who raises
sheep knows to what the above
refers. The "hell wether" is
the lender of the flock. He
usually wenrs a hell,and where
ever he and his hell go thither
his llock obediently follows.
For good or ill, to safety or i::
to danger, where ho leads they
go. If he happens to bo a wise
old fellow his followers profit
by his wisdom, but if he de?
velops vicious and unreliable
traits disaster is almost certain
to overtake the (lock.
Have you ever paused to think
how like sheep are we humans
in this respect? Look around
in almost any community anil
you will easily spot the bell
wether. Anil not only can you
locate him, hut a little study
of local conditions will in
vaiablo disclose to the careful
observer Iiis trite character-'
iati?a as n loader,
tf the community is progros
Isjye, prosperous, law abiding
land happy, yon may put it
[down/thai this state of affaire
; results largely from the fact
that these qualities are inherent
in the leaders of community
life.
We know that many people
like to think and assert that we
are all equal and recognize no
leaders, but this is purely a lig
menl of the imagination Nine
bill of every teil of us are too
busy with our own allairs to
take time to attend to the de.
tails af community life. There
are a thousand and one ques?
tions of public impart that must
fall to the lot of some one who
has the time and the capacity
to grapple with them, and un
der such conditions community
leaders are developed. If, hap?
pily, lit! possesses wisdom,
coupled with a spirit of unself?
ish devotion to the interests of
the community, then tin- com?
munity is indeed fortunate.
15ut when ht.> develops vicious
trails and an inclination for
self-seeking, then, like the
I sheep, his followers arc in dan?
ger.
While, as we have said, most
of us are too busily engaged in
our own pursuits to assume
these burdens of civic responsi?
bility, wo yet may keep a
watchful eye upon those who
have assumed the burdens and
assist them in tile faithful dis
charge, of their trusts.
This we can ami should do,
i'very one of us. This is a pret?
ty good old world, after all,
and safe ieaders and public of?
tmals can easily be found, and
every public spirited citizens
should join the bunt.?Ex
] change.
