West Virginia and Oregon. x
Claimed by both sides, these states have 38 electoral votes. Returns up to late this Wtqrnoori showed that President Wilson is reasonably sure of 254 electoral votesr
while Mr. Hughes has been conceded at least 239. Necessary for choice are 266 votes in the electoral college. - '

Capk Philip T. Blansfield, a Demo

CITY MAY HAVE TO EXPEND
$5,000 TO DECIDE WHO WILL
GET JOB THAT PAYS $100
Bridgeport may have to spend $5,000
to decide who has been elected to a
$100 job as selectman.
The official returns in the town
clerk's office ' show that two Demo
crats, James P. Griffin and Francis
Heavy, have received a '. tie vote of
8.694 each. There being no choice as
to a low man on the' Democratic ticket
it is quite probable that City Attorney
William H. Comley. Jr.. ' will under
jthe law declare no election ah& require
i a special election for next Monday.
This is in accordance with the stat
utes, which in the event of no elec
jtion, require that the special election
shall be held on the Monday follow
ing the regular election day. Since
jthe special election must be held .in
ithe same manner and form this, means
that voting machines must be used In
x every district in the city and almost
ian equal number of workers employed
.es? might be employed at a regular
Selection. .
In Bridgeport the selectman are not
very important officers. They have
only to do with the making of voters
and hold sessions once each year re
celving $100 each and some slight ex
penses for these services. .
The returns as filed with the town
clerk last night show James A. Turn
er to have received 10,107 votes.
Ralph S. Broderick received 10,104
votes.. Joseph L. Verilli received
j 10,077 votes. These candidates were
Republicans and had. the Democratic
vote not been identical they would
have been declared elected.
Thomas Hungerford led the Demo
cratic candidates with. 8,709 votes.
The other Democratic candidates were
tied as stated above. Had either re
ceived one less then the election
cc-uld have been decided. As in the
vcustom of years past the low man on
the losing ticket would have' been
dropped but on this record there is no
low man.
The matter was called to the atten
tion of City Attorney William H. Com
ley, Jr., today and he '-still had it
under consideration at press hour. He
would not say whether or not it would
be necessary to call, the special elec
tion. Political" dopesters at city hall
today were of the opinion that the
special election must be called.
Former Mayor Hugh Stirling said
that there was no other course . and
that an election must be held in each
district In the city next Monday in ac
cordance, with the election held yester
' ' day.
, It.wase also said that if either
James P. Griffin or Francis P. Heavey
hould refuse to serve that the mat
ter' would be settled and either might
mm but
in

hy the police commissioners and
which will no doubt be pastied by the
common council, the" superintendent's
salary will be increased $1,000, to take,
effect April 1, leaving' a . pension' of
$1,750 for the retiring head.. v
"In the Republican caucus last year,
Suckley was the choice for the posi-
tion over Redgate by a majority of
9 , to 3. King refused, however, to
have Suckley appointed and stated
that if Redgate was not acceptable he
would see to it that the late Eugene
Birmingham was continued in office.
The selection of Redgate was finally
agreed upon. : Y
Suckley is an extremely popular of
ficial with the -Republican leaders and
possesses high qualifications, being
the logical successor in event of Red
gate's resignation, which will be, de
manded by political leaders, as soon
as theraise in pay is effected.-
be sworn into office. -
' The phase of the law which City At
toney Comley is considering today pro
vides that wher no plurality shows for
candidates the special election shall
be held.
In the event that the special elec
tion is called it will ,be necessary to
apply to the judges of the superior
court for an order to open, the voting
machines so that 'they may be used
over again. City Attorney Comley is
also considering whether the Repub
lican candidates having received a
plurality over all other candidates, are
not elected and whether the vote at
the special election, if one is held.shau
be only between the Democrats, So
cialists, Prohibitionists and Socialist
Labor party candidates, with the Re
publicans declared in office.
Again another question has arisen
as to the name of the selectman voted
at the head of the ticket. On the
voting machines the name of James A.
Turner appears. James A. Turner is
a lawyer and real estate operator,
prominent in- Republican politics and
living in Iranistan avenue in ' the
Fourth districtt James Turner, the
real candidate', is a president of the
former board of selectmen employed
in the Holme3 & 'Edwards Silver Co.
and has lived for years at 761 Central
avenue .in the Twelfth district.

Miss Ruth Macdonald, 20 years of

ment issued by T. B. Kennedy, secre
tary of state Republican committee
at 10 o'clock said "Returns indicate
that Wilson and Kendrick have car-
ried Wyoming."
FR
m
Extending from the coast to the Mississippi river, a veritable landslide for Wilson upset
calculations which late last evening seemed to indicate the election of Mr. Hughes as assured. The
vote from the western and middle western states dumfounded the Republican managers, and even
startled some Democrats. '
This noon, both sides were claiming the victory. Both said they had votes to spare, but,
both were basing their information upon scattering returns from the doubtful states of California,
Minnesota, West Virginia and Oregon. v.
The race in California is very close. Wilson left San Francisco with a plurality of about 10,
000, and this was increased in Sacramento County by about 9,000. Partial returns from Los Angeles
county, a strong Republican district, showed Hughes leading there, and in the partial count in Ala
meda county, the Hughes plurality was 5,000. -
There are 5,917 voting precincts in California Up to 2:30, 3,091 had returned their figures,
