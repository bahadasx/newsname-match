Will My Funds
Be Safe?
That's the very first questoin that enters
your mind when you consider depositing
your money in a bank or making an in
vestment.
It is a very reasonable and logical question. Money
is hard to earn, and still harder to save. You have a
right to DEMAND safety.

,of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United
States, and conducted by leading business men of this
city.

Incomplete returns from
Third
District :
Returns from the eight parishes
composing the Third congressional
district Tuesday night indicated the
re-election of Whit P. Martin over
his Democratic opponent, Sheriff
Wade O. Martin, by a small major
ity. The returns showed that Judge
Whit Martin carried Assumption,
Iberia, Lafourche, St. Mary and
Terrebonne, while Wade Martin was
ahead in Lafayette, St. Martin and
Vermillion.
Only the most meager returns
came in from Vermillion, and sup
porters of Wade Martin claimed that
complete returns from this parish
would bring their candidate's total
up to or ahead that of the Progres
sive and Republican choice.
Congressman Martin had a major
ity of about 400 on the face of re
turns.

Isame number in their favor. Definite
results of the election will not be
known until tomorrow.
. .Some doubt as to whether still
later news will change the light, and
there is also an existing conservative
opinion that Hughes will come out
favorably.
; Wall street opinion says that Hu
I ghes is the man. The Chicago Tri
! bune states in a special edition that
jit takes several days to ascertain de

j All amendments voted on in Louis

Abberville, La. Nov. 8th
Special to Daily Review:
Vermillion complete excepting one
box to come in shows Wade Martin
1 maority 314. The missing box car
ries only ten votes.
, Late reports from authoritftive
' source indicate that Wade O. Mar
! tin, democrat, has been elected to
Congress from the Third Louisiana
District. The large majority given
him by Vermillion parish have given
: ground for this report.
j Telegraphic reports from the vot
j ing precincts from all parts of the
I United States seem to indicate that
Woodrow Wilson has been re-elected
to the presidency. The tabulated re
port given below of the apparent
vote at 10:30 this 'morning shows
that Wilson has received a majority
in thirty-three states and that he will
secure from these states 312 votes in
the electoral college, a margin over
the necessary electoral vote in his
favor of 46 electoral votes. Only a
few states at this hour have given
out complete returns but the report
appears to justify Wall Street in
giving odds of ten to one on the
election of Wilson.
Following is the states and num
ber of electoral votes which are now
credited to each candidate. Complete
returns may change the present re
port:
