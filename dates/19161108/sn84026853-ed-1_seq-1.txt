Rev. J. M. Lawson died at his
home in Abbeville Sunday morning
at four o'clock,.Nov. 5th, 1916. He
was only sick a few hours, being
stricken about twelve o'clock and,
never regaining consciousness, he
died at four. /
. Funeral services were held at the
Methodist church at half past four

by Rev. J. L. Daniel and assisted by
the other ministers of the city. The

in Abbeville and for many years was
one of our most prominent merchants,
succeeding his father in business.
About twenty years ago he

until about four years ago when he
retired. He was regarded by all as
a devout and sincere christian, he
visited the sick and suffering, he was
kind in his charities, a loving and
an indulgent father. Mr. Lawson
took much interest in preaching at
the county farm and his kindly visits
and simple sermons will be missed
bv t?e inmates of the home.
On the resignation of Mr. W. R.
Bradley as county superintendent of
education, Mr. Lawson was appointed
to fill the term and has held the
office ever since.
About twenty-five years ago Mr.
Lawson was married to Miss Jodie
Russell, and to them were born five
children, Mrs. J. T. McGaw, of Columbia,
Russell Lawson of Columbia,
and Lewis, Hiram and Lemuel Lawson
of Abbeville, all of whom survive.

and a brother, Mr. Hiram Lawson are

Many beautiful floral offerings
expressed the friendship of the people
of Abbeville for the family and
for the deceased. 4
Mr. Lawson was a man of sentiment
and of deeply religious thought
and he has always expressed the hope
that his death would occur so that
he could be buried at sundown on the
Sabbath day and his wishes were carried
out. *
HOME AGAIN.
Mr. and Mrs. D. H. Hill are back
from their wedding trip and are at
home to their friends at th?,home of
Miss Mamie Lou Smith until their
handsome new house is finished.
COUNTY FAIl
A GRE
By far the largest crowd ever seen
at a fair in Abbeville county came
here on Friday, the closing day of
the seventh annual county fair, the
principal features of this day being
the football game between Erskine
and Baily Military Institute, and the
parade of more than 1,200 school
children from all sections of the
county, and the daily horse racing in

the association, and established new
records for attendance.
While the farm exhibits were few
in number, such products as were
exhibited attracted much attention
and favorable comment from the
throngs of visitors who passed
through the exhibit halls during the
fair. The live stock department made
up for any shortage in the farm exhibits,
however. More than 40 horse
and mule colts were shown on the
first day. In the hog exhibit the
Duroc-Jersey was the favorite.

AN ABBEVILLE
MAN IS SHOT
t FROM AMBUSH
Jim White Fired Upon
Without Warning
Saturday Night.
-^im White, who lives just over the
Abbeville county line, declares that
he was shot from ambush Saturday
night when he was returning home
from Greenwood in his buggy. He
came to town yesterday and was
given medical treatment for flesh
wound received from a scattering of
No. 4'\shot from his hip down to his
ankle and returned home later little
the worse for his experience. He
had one foot hanging outside the
buggy and- this is the reason the
load sprinkled him from the heel up.
White states that he was fired on
from ambush near the roadside. His
assailant gave no alarm whatever,
but pulled down on him and , then
made his escape. The wounded man
has no idea who did the shooting
and is just as much in the dark as
to why he should have been used as
a target.
FRANK DORN KILLED
ON ABBEVILLE ROAD
, \
Autoflaobile Turn* Over Crushing
Skull and Causing Almost Instant
Death.
Frank Dorn was accidentally killed
near Abbeville last Saturday night,
while on his way back to the County
chaingang camp. Mr. Dorn was in
the Car with Lucien Schroeder .and
they were driving at a stiff - speed
when it was seen that they were t
about to run into a buggy in front.
The car was swerved to the side,
turned over, throwing Mr. Dorn off
against the bank and fracturing his
skull, death resulting in less than a
half hour.
Mr. Dorn was from Indianapolis, *
Ind., and his body was sent there for
burial at the request of his mother
and sister, who survive him.
Mr. Dorn has been connected with
the chaingang for some time and has
recently been promoted to foreman
to succeed D. E. Newell. 1
