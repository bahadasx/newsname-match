President Holds Lead of 204 Votes In
670 Precincts at 3 A M. McCumber
Swamps Burke, Polling Heavy Vote
LYNN J. FRAZIER WILL BE
NEXT GOVERNOR OF STATE
Wilson and H'lijrhes are rumiing neck and neck in North Dakota.
With scattering returns from 670 precincts, or about oile-third of
the state, Wilson has 23,262, to Ijtuglies' 23,058, or a lead of 204
votes. If the president can maintain his present percentage of
gain he should carry the state by more than 1,000. There is.souie
strong Hughes territory to be heard from yet and it would be idle
speculation at this writing, 3 a. m.,to hazard a guess on the state.
Hughes Loses All Eut Two Counties.
Early returns indicate that Hughes
loses all but twp of the counties in
the state, containing the larger cit­
ies. Thirty'six precincts in Cass
county, Fargo county seat, give
Hughes and Wilson 2,(KU. For­
ty-seven precincts in Grand Forks
county give Hughes^1,751 and Wilson
2,480. Twenty-out of 72 precincts in
Wan! county,, in which Mlnot is lo­
cated, gives Hughes StM) and Wilson
1.305. Six precincts out of OS in
Stutsman county, including the Third
and fourth wards of Jamestown, give
Wilson 341 and Hughes 233. Eleven
out of 84- precincts in Stark county,
of which Dickinson is the seat, give Grand"Forks
vote of any Republican.
Returns Come Slowly.
Returns are coming in slowly, ow­
ing to a record vote, due to the favor­
able weather. But these facts are
self-evident.
McCumber Has Big Plurality.
..IcCumber has the state easily
over Burke. In returns from 526 pre­
cincts out of about 1,800, M'cCumbter
has 2',129 to Burke's 12,719. In
Hurke's own .county, Ramsey, Mc­
Cumber is leading, and his managers
last evening claimed to have carried
every county in the state. That Burke
is defeated most decisively is indi­
cated by the incomplete returns.
rorty-flve out of 60 precincts in
Grand Forks county give McCumber
1,"52 and Burke 1,457.
Eleven out of 34 Stark county pre­
cincts give McCumber 499 and l?urke
261. Four wards of the city of Dick­
inson are included in this count.
Eigjit precincts out of 70 in Ward
county give E'urke 18o and McCum­
ber 174.
Frazier Has Long Lead.
Frazier, Republican candidate for
governor, leads MacArthur, his Demo­
cratic opponent, more than 9,000 in 273
precincts in 20 counties. As more com­
plete returns come in from the rural

still was in the doubtful column near

from 433 precincts gave President Wil­
son 65,614 votes against 63.838 for
Hughes. Most of this vote was from
the city precincts. Politicians were
unable to forecast how the country
districts would go.
Governor Capper, on the face of the
returns from 367 precincts, has been
elected over W. C. Lanadon, his Demo­
cratic opponent.

DICKINSON NORMAL
SEEMS TO HAVE WON
BY BIG VOTE
Only meagre returns can be given
on the various constitutional amend­
ments. but those available show a big
vote for the Dickinson normal school
which seems to forecast a victory for
the Stark county city. The Slope went
almost unanimdus. Owing to the heavy
vote, some precincts in the rural dis­
tricts will not have their complete re­
turns in until this evening.
The bootlegger law which was sub­
mitted is not likely to be held up, up
•n the face of early tabulations. The
Non-Partisan league supporters will
probably be able to prevent the repeal
of the bill levy for terminal elevator.
No returns are available on the
amendment establishing another in­
sane asylum.

In Burleigh county, for instance,
while Burke, Fisk and Spalding went
out of Bismarck with substantial ma­
jorities/in the rural precincts which
have reported to date they received
only 105 to 120 votes, while the total
for the Non-Partisan league candidates
was from 354 to 389. The leaguers
seem to have known wliat they were
19? talking about when they predicted

9^5 date in Burleigh county, outside of

1,316 Burke, 820, and Spalding 722, as com
765 pared with 246 for Robinson. 280 for

one rural districts cut down the lead
until the vote now stands Fisk, 936
Burke, 925 Spalding, 833 Robinson,
625 Birdzell, 634, and Grace, 573.
the remainder of Burleigh's 25 pre
1,395 cincts follow suit, the Non-Partisan ju
1,078 diciary ballot will have a majority in
the county.
Country Precincts' Solid.
Just how solid the country districts
are on the judiciary may be deduced
from the fact that Apple Creek gave
Robinson 19 and Burke but four.
Trygg gave Fiske and Spalding two
apiece and Burke three, while Grace
led with 26. Fort Rice returned 22
votes for the Non-Partisan ticket and
only two for the independent slate. In
Wiid Rose, Judge F'iske received but
one yote and Robinson and Birdzell
each had 24. In Telfer it was 23 to 1.
Only in precincts embracing good
sized villages, or in the immediate
proximity of one. did the independent
judiciary ballot stand any show what­
ever outside of Bismarck. In Sterling,
Fisk tied Birdzell for third place in
Hay Creek Burke had a lead of one
over Birdzell and Fisk tied the latter.
The independent ballot carried McKen
zie by 28 to 32 to 14 to 16.
Rural Vote Will Win.
When it is remembered that four
fifths of the North Dakota vote is
rural, it becomes evident that there
is a very great certainty that the
Non-partisan league candidates will
control the supreme court for six.
years succeeding January 1. The
hold-over members of the court are,
Justices Bruce and Christianson.
This is the first time in the history
of the state that the voters havg been
called upon to elect three members
of thQ court, giving the electors an
opportunity to name a majority.

Hughes Receives Returns
At Neio York Uptown Hotel
Family Remain With Him
New York, Nov., t.—Charles E. dent and the state was conceded by
Hughes and his family received the the Democrats. Soon afterwards,
election returns—here tonight at the
uptown hotel, which ,has been the. Re­
publican nominee's "^headquarters
since his nomination.
When the early returns began to
come in, Mr. Hughes was.Asleep. The
first -simp* be awoke*
told or tTie announcement of a New
York newspaper that he had carried
New York state by a plurality of 150,
000.
Mr. Hughes smiled.
Family Stay With Him.
Mrs. Hughes and their three daugh­
ters, Catherine, Elizabeth and Helen,
scanned the returns over Mr. Hughes'
shoulders. Presently. Charles E.
hughes, Jr., and his wife, and Dr. Col­
lins S. Carter, Mrs. Hughes' brother,
joined the group.
Dinner was ordered, the first in
months at which the entire family
were present.
The returns came in faster and din­
ner was neglected for a time to read
them. A huge electric sign several
blocks away, flashed from New York,
divided the family's attention with the
telegraphic reports. They lingered at
dinner until late and the group in the
corridor, opposite the telegraph room,
heard outbreaks of the latter.
Mrs. Hughes Congratulates Husband.
At 9 o'clock Mrs. Hughes congratu­
lated Mr. Hughes on his election.
Mr. Hughes gave out no statement.
Wflson Papers Concede His Defeat.
Although President Wilson's secre­
tary at the White House and Chair­
man Vance McCormick of the Demo­
cratic National committee made state­
ments that the complete returns would
show the re-election of President Wil­
son, the trend on the face of the re­
turns was toward Hughes and.early in
the evening some of the New York
newspapers, which have supported
President Wilson, conceded his de­
feat, although they made no statement
in figures.
Big New York Majority.
Early in the evening, a great major­
ity for Hughes in New York was evi-
SCATTERED RETURNS
Helena, Mont., Nov. 7.—At 9 o'clock
scattered returns from small precincts
in Montana indicated tliat Wilson has
carried the state, and that Sam V.
Stewart, Democratic, incumbent has
been re-elected Governor over Frank
J. Edwards, Republican, by a safe
majority.
COLORADO FOR WILSON
BY SAFE PLURALITY
Denver, Colo.. Nov. 7.—Wilson has
carried Colorado by a safe plurality
of at least 15,000 votes.
Julius C. Gunter, Democrat, for gov­
ernor, is leading Governor Carlson,
and probably has been elected.
WILSON HAS GOOD

McCormick, chairman of the
•Dei
ocra
Democratic supporters conceded the
loss of all New England. The incom­
ing returns from the middle west, al­
though far from complete, showed the
Hughes figures growing fast.
Electoral Vote.
An early estimate of the Hughes
electoral vote, without Ohio, placed it
at 277, eleven more than nccessary for
a majority in the electoral college.
The Hughes majority, reported from
Indiana and Illinois, were regarded by
the Republican leaders as an indica­
tion as to what might be expected
from the stales further west when the
figures began coming in. The differ­
ence in time, and the fact that the
polls in some western states closed
later than in the east, made figures
earlier in the evening impossible.
Next Congress Question.
Nothing definite as to the complex­
ion of the next congress was available
early in the night. The Democratic
majority in the house had been de­
creased by one. It was conceded that
the majority in the senate had been
decreased by two—one by the Repub­
lican victory in Maine last September,
and the other by the election of Wil
lian Calder from New York, who de­
feated William McCombs.
A crowd of thousands, with brass
bands, gathered in the hotel where
Mr. Hughes was staying and at 11
o'clock sent up a committee to request
the nominee to appear before them.
Mr. Hughes sent back word that he
appreciated the request, but did not
wish to appear until the result was
demonstrated beyond a doubt.
The crowd went away.
Sits Up Late in Morning,
New York. Nov. 8.—Hughes sat up
with his family to receive election re­
turns until 1:50 a. m. He then went
to bed and will get up at 7 a. m. to
receive further reports. He declined
to make any comment on reports re­
ceived up to bed time.
EMILY PEiSm
2td PIUSUM
Philadelphia, Pa.. Nov. 7.—Early re­
turns from Pennsylvania indicate that
Charles E. Hughes has carried the
state by 200,000 plurality. Returns
also indicate that the Democrats
probably will not increase their rep­
resentation of si:: in congress.
Philander Knox is elected to the sen­
ate by the Republicans by a large
plurality and the entire state Repub­
lican ticket was also successful, by a
little less than that for Hughes.
BOTH PARTIES CLAIM
VICTORY IN OHIO
Cincinnati, O.. Nov. 7—President
Wilson had only a slight lead on
Hughes when the first few hundred
precincts in Ohio were reported and
state managers of both parties were
claiming victory tonight. Returns
from 754 precincts out of 5.570 in
Ohio give Wilson 62,824, and Hughes
51,806.

DEMOCRATS EXPECT
TO CONTROL THE HOUSE
New York, Nov. 7.—Democratic
leaders insisted early today, that their
control of the house would not be lost
and that the senate would remain
without doubt Democratic. Republican
leaders, however, were still claiming
the house and were hopeful of /the
senate.
BULLETIN 9:20 A. M.
In Virginia and other states listed
as doubtful states, except California!
the Democrats appeared to be leading.
At this hour the Republicans had
not overcome the Democratic major*
ity in the house of representatives, nor
in the senate. With about 100 oon*
grcssional districts still to lie heard
from the Republicans had aiiide a net
gain of eight members in the house,
but late returns from New York indl*
cated that two of these, might be r»
vised. In the senate, the Democrats
showed losses from New Yortt, New
Jersey, and Maryland. The indications
were they would lose the two senators
from Indiana, one from West Virginia
and possibly one each in Ohio, Mon*
tana and Arizona. The Democrats*
however, gained three senators from
Rhode Island, Deleware and Utah.
Conceded, all the probable Republl*
can gains would give a net Republican
gain of seven in the senate and leavqr
the Democratic majority at two.
For Hughes.
These states were counted for Wil*
son: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
Colorado, Wlorida, Georgia, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maryland. Mississippi, Mis*
souri, Montana, Nebraska, North Car*
olina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
South Carolina, Tennessee. Texas,
Utah and Virginia. Total 232.
For Hughes, the following states
were claimed: Connecticut, Deleware,
Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Jersey. New York,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Da­
kota, Vermont, Wisconsin and Wyo*
ming. Total, 218.
At 5:15 a. m. returns from Cheyenne
took Wyoming from the Hughes list
and placed its three elecotral votes In
the doubtful column with Wilson lead*
ing.
Doubtful States.
These states were still doubtful:!
California, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas,
New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon,
Washington and West Virgiania. To*
tal 81.
From the doubtful states the returns
were coming in slowly and there were
indications that the full result would
not be known before noon. The chair*
man of the Republican party and Dem*
ocratic committees both claimed vlo*
tory for their respective candidates*
The Republicans seemed to have tha
best prospects in Indiana, Minnesotat
Oregon and West Virginia.
Early Bulletins Favor Hughes.
Early bulletins all favored Hughes,
The New York World and Times, Mad*
ing Democratic papers, conceded
Hughes' election as late as 2 p. DW
this morning (Wednesday).
From that our a change set In. Thai
