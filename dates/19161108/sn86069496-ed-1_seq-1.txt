A Courier-Journal message received
here this morning at 4 o'clock con
cedes Mr Hughes election. The big
States, New Yonc, Ohio, Pennsyl
vania, Indiana, Illinois are all claimed
for the Republican candidate.
We had hoped to be able to give a
definite statement in The News to
day, showing the vote each candidate
will receive in the electorial college,
but some States are so close, claimed
by both sides, make it impossible for
us to so do.
The Courier-Journal last night esti
mated the Democratic majority in
Kentucky at 13,000, and elected ten
Congressmen out of eleven. Caleb

if he carries West Va., Kansas, Massa

yellow chrysanthemums, and potted
ferns, and was lighted throughout by

The ceremony was short and im
pressive, and was performed by the

shower of congratulations and good
wishes was bestowed upon the happy
young couple, and upon their depart
ure there followed a shower of rice

county, in the Presidential contest, is
not so large as was expected. It was
generally believed that ' Mr. Hughes
would carry it by 350 or 400, but he
only received 193 to the good. Mr.
Neat, the local Republican candidate
for Congress, in the Eighth district,
carried the county by 384 majority.
Russell, Cumberland, Green, Met

It is impossible, with the informa
tion before us, to give anything like a
correct vote, but the result is in ac
cord with the statement made above.
Next week we will publish a table
of Adair's vote, showing how each

A telegram from the Louisville

the Wilson forces have not given up
the election, and that Hughes has not
been elected by a whole lot.

SKETCHES.
1 j. w. anaw.
The above is the name of a travel
ing man who has been visiting the
merchants of Columbia and those lo
cated out in the county of Adair for
about eighteen or twenty years. The
entire time he has been on the road,
is not known to us.
He represents Burroughs & Taylor,
manufacturers of pants and woolen
goods, who are located at Cave, Tenn.
There is not a more polished gentle
man, nor one who has more friends,
who visits the merchants of Adair
county. He reaches here three times
a year and his trips are universally
satisfactory to him, nearly every cus
tomer giving' him an order. He han
dles very popular brands which he pre
sents and sell on their merit. When
Mr. Shaw reaches Columbia the whole
community knows of his arrival. He
is over six feet tall, straight as an In
dian, and one of the most evenly pro
portioned men we ever had the pleas
ure of meeting. His manners are
faultless, an easy and entertaing con
verstionalist, making him not only
popular with the merchants, but with
the entire commonality.
Mr. Shaw has an attractive home
in Nashville, Tenn., a devoted com
panion and one child, a daughter, who
is married, and his incomings, after
being out on a long trip, is hailed with
delight. Notwithstanding he is strong
in mind, determined in his purposes,
no woman has a tenderer heart, nor
one that goes out more freely for those
in distress.
We trust that he will continue his
visits to Columbia as long as he is
able to travel, and when he finishes
his work here below, and reaches the
gate of St. Peter, he will hear the wel
come plaudid: "Come in and sit at
my right hand."

Death of Miss Mary D. Everman
Miss Mary D. Everman? the sixteen-year-old
daughter of Mrs. John A.
Gilkey, died at the Massie Memorial
Hospital at ten o'clock Saturday morn
ing, following a two-weeks' illness due
to a complication of diseases.
Miss Everman was taken sick about
two weeks ago and it was found that
she was ill from an aggravated case
of appendicitis. She was taken to
the Massie Hospital suffering intense
pain, where she underwent an opera
tion with the hope of securing relief.
The disease had progressed rapidly,
however, and despite the efforts of
her physicians, she grew steadily
worse and passed away Saturday.
Miss Everman was an exceptionally
attractive young woman and by her
pleasing manner and sunny disposition
had greatly endeared herself to her
schoolmates at the Paris City School
and with her acquaintances as well.
For the past week it had been
known by the physicians in charge
that Miss Everman could not recover,
but the plucky young woman insisted
that she would regain her health and
she made a heroic fight against the
grim reaper. However, a short time
before she died, she realized the inev
itable, and told her mother and other
loved ones at her bedside, that she
was going to die, and the most pathet
ic scene ever witnessed at the local
hospital occurred when Miss Ever
man said farewell to her mother and
others at her bedside, and she passed
away singing, "Will There Be Any
Stars In My Crown "
Misa Everman is survived by her
mother, Mis J. A. Gilkey, of Paris,
two brothers, James and Ellis Ever
man, of Corbin, and a half sister,
Marian Fithian Everman and J. A
Gilkey, Jr., of Paris.
The funeral services were conduct
ed at the home of Dr Gilkey, on Sec
ond Street, Monday afternoon at 1:30
o'clock, by Eld. W. E Ellis, pastor of
the Paris Christian Church, and the
burial followed in the family lot at
the North Middletown Cemetery.
The pall bearers, formerschoolmates
of the deceasd, were: Herbert Sledd
and Stoddard Young, of North Mid
dletown, and Fithian Arkle, Vale
Baldwin, John Clay, Stanley Price,
Charles Tackett and Stanley Rule, of
the Peris City School. Paris, Ky.,

where they were tenderly laid to rest.
The floral offerings were many and
beautiful.

bedside several days before the sad
end came. Also her brother, Mr.
Bruce Callison, and sisters, Mrs. Hor

Death of Samuel S. Feese.
The passing of the subject of this
writing was not a surprise, as he had
been rapidly declining for weeks be
fore the final dissolution, his affliction
being pulmonary trouble. He was
born in Adair county, August 2, 18S0,
and died November 2, 1916, making
him 36 years and three months old. He
leaves a wife, two little daughters,
father and one brother, and many
other relatives. At about the age of
fourteen years he professed his faith
in Christ and united with the Metho
dist Church, and was attended in the
last days of his illness by his pastor,
Rev. L F. Piercy, who officiated at the
funeral, assisted by Eld. 2. T. Wil
liams and Rev. O. P. Bush
Though he knew that he could not
get well, he expressed a desire to live,
but satd he was prepared to go. He
was of a jovial disposition and was
liked by every bedy.
Quite a number of friends wee at
the home and also the cemetery to pay
their respects to the departed, and ex
tend sympathy to the sorrowing wife
and other relatives.
The deceased was an industrious
young man. Three years ago he built
a home for his little family, and en
joyed the hope of rearing his children
and living happily with his compan
ion, and was cut down in the prime of
his manhood.
The community feels for the wife,
who was Miss Grace Conover, and her
little ones. May God comfort them
in this sad hour of affliction.
When the grave was finished it was
covered with beautiful, white flowers
by his neighbors and many friends.

Halloween Imps.
Last Tuesday evening Miss Cary
Rosenfield and Miss Edna Lewis de
lightfully entertained the spooks, and
they were present in large numbers. It
was the most amusing gathering held
in Columbia for many moons. Nearly
all the young people of the community
and many of the older set, married
people, got ready for the occasion, and
the amusement continued until a late
hour. There were some who were ar
rayed uniquely, while others looked
hideous. So perfect were the dis
guises of some that they were not rec
ognized until after they removed their
masks.
People who did not go to the home
were given an opportunity to see a
large number of the participants at
the Paramount Picture show, as they
attended this popular play house be
fore going to the hill. Many say they
laughed until their arms nearly fell
from their shoulders. An occasion
like this is better than medicine, for
the low spirited can smile broadly,
loudly and grow fat.
Last Sunday night week thieves at
tempted to enter the store of C. H.

mediately after they arrived, took the
trail, following it for a mile and a

this time there is no clue.
