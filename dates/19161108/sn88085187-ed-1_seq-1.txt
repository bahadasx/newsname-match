WILfON
FIGHT IS
HOT FOR
GOVERNOR
Half of the 2,385 precincts in
the state Wednesday afternoon
show Wilson leading by nearly
15,000 votes.
It is conceded he has carried
the state by a good margin.
Lister is leading Mcliride for
governor by about 4,000, while
Polndexter'B re-election to the U.
8 senate is assured with an over
whelming majority over Turner.
It has been a neck-and-neclc
race so far for governor but ev
erything seems to point to Lister's
re-election. As new precincts are
heard from his lead apparently
continues to increase.

PRESIDENT
SEEMS TO
BE VICTOR
At 3 o'clock, eastern time, the United Press
announced: "At this hour the re-election of
President Wilson seems a foregone conclusion,
but is not an actual certainty until the returns
are all in."
(t'nit'Ml Press I.chmiil Wire.)
NEW YORK, Nov. B.—President Wilson was
making steady gains this afternoon in the two states
—Minnesota and California—the carrying of cither
one of which would make his election certain,
Regarding these two as doubtful, along with New
Hampshire, New Mexico and Oregon, United Press
returns showed Wilson to have already acquired 256
votes in the electoral college; Hughes 238.
The president, therefore, requires only 10 votes for
re-election.
At democratic headquarters the president's mana
gers, regarding the election as already won, turned
attention to celebrating.
An Impromptu parade past repiililican headquar
ters, to jeer at their opponents, was carried out glee
fully.
At 2 o'clock Senator ITollis ..I' New Hampshire in
formed Chairman McCormick from Burlington that
unofficial hut complete returns from that state gave
it to Wilson by 330 majority.
The republicans were conceding nothing and
sticking fast to their claims of Hughes' election.
In the meantime, President Wilson and Uov.
Hughes were receiving returns from their political
advisers constantly. Hughes remained closely in
his room at the Hotel Astor in New York, and a con
tinuous stream of telegrams and reports was kept
running to him.
President Wilson, at Shadow Lawn, was in com
munication with Secretary Tumidly frequently dur
ing the morning, hut in the afternoon upon reassur
ing reports from his secretary the president went
out for a game of golf. Mrs. Wilson went with him.
Mrs. Hughes was at her husband's side in New
York. At 2 o'clock, Governor Hughes and Mrs.
Hughes went for an automobile ride. The candidate
was given a rousing cheer as he walked smiling to his
machine at the curb.
In the hour before noon North Dakota returns jus
tified placing that state in the democratic list and at
11:45 the state republican committee conceded Wy
oming to the opposition.
Early morning changes indicated were as follows:
Kansas —Transferred from the doubtful to the
Wilson column, being conceded by Chairman Will
cox.
Idaho—Transferred from the Hughes column to
the Wilson column.
Indiana —Transferred from the doubtful column
to the Hughes column.
Minnesota Lead Grows
(United Press Leased Wire.)
ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. B.—With 1610 precincts
out of 3024 Wilson has 121,023 to Hughes' 113,970. Tn
the last 171 precincts, all rural, Hughes has gained
430 net on Wilson. Wilson now has a net lead of
7,053. At this rate Wilson can win the state.
World Switches Forecast
(United Press Leaaed Wire.)
NEW YORK, Nov. B.—The New York World
(democrat) which conceded the election of Hughes
last night, claimed the re-election of President Wil
son this afternoon.
California for Wilson
(United Press Leaaed Wire.)
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. B.—President Wilson
leaped into the lead in the California presidential
race just before noon today when returns from §198
precincts out of 5870 in California gave him a total
vote of 239,919 against 232,376 for Charles E. Hughes .
