Gives $50,000 for 200-Cow Farm.
One of the largest real estate deals
made in Orleans county in years, and
probably the largest farm deal ever
made in the county was consummated
Monday when W. E. Nye' and son
deeded to Thomas Bovine of Derby,
their 900 acre farm (see picture on
page six) located three miles from
Barton village toward West Glover.
The Nye's took a 200 acre farm located
in the town of Derby, near Newport,
in the trade, making the property
valuation involved in the deal and
transfer of the two deeds, about
$70,000.
Mr. Bovine is a practical farmer
with plenty of capital and has some
definite ideas as to what he will , do
with his new property, on which there
are now 100 cows, 35 head of young
stock, 25 hogs, 10 horses, 200 hens,
50 geese and probably $12,000 worth
of standing timber. The Monitor
understands Mr. Bovine will' increase
his dairy to 200 cows, which the farm
is capable of carrying, and that he
will also raise sheep.
The farm is not only a good pro
ducer but has every modem equip
ment. The buildings are electric
lighted, the stable is equipped with
a milking machine, there are electric
motors and everything to make farm
ing - on a large scale easy and
profitable.
Mr. Bovine takes possession of
his new property at once and Mr.
Nye goes to his Derby properi3".
Union Evangelistic Services Begin
Sunday Evening.
Rev. Thomas Hall will spoak to a
union audiance at the Congregational
church Sunday evening, the opening
services of two week s cf special
Evangelistic services to be conducted
by the Methodist and Congregational
churches.
Miss Hall, daughter of the Evan
gelist, will have charge of the singing.
She is an excellent singer herself and
the singing, as well as the evan
gelistic services, promises to be yery
interesting.
North Troy Concern Buys Large Tim
ber Properties.
The Blair Veneer company of North
Troy has just concluded two large
purchases, being all the timber ex
cept spruce on hundreds of acres of
land in and around the township of
Potton, Canada, some being located
around Fullerton pond and on adja
cent territory. It is called the Heath
tract and was bought of the Escanaba
Manufacturing company tf Escanaba,
Mich. By the terms of the sale, at
least 500,000 feet of timber must be
removed each season, but it is expect
ed much more will be cut.
The Blair Veneer company has also
bought of H. E. Gray of Westfield all
his timbered land, real estate, his mill
and mill property and equipment, ex
cept so much land as lies easterly and
southerly of the Main street running
through the village of Westfield. This
reserves to Mr. Gray his home farm
connected with his village residence.
Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.
Rev. I. A. Ran key, Pastor
You are cordially invited to attend
all services.
Morning worship, 10.45.
Sunday school, 12 o'clock.
Epworth League, 6 o'clock.
Evening service at 7 o'clock.
Prayer meeting Thursday evening
at 7.30.
At the morning service the sub
ject was, "Self-justification." Text,
Luke 10:29, "But he, willing to justi
fy himself." The pastor showed some
of the excuses made by people today
for neglecting the call of God to duty.
We are what we choose to be. One
may be sincere and be wrong. Be
cause religion is a mystery some re
fuse to accept and the speaker asked
the question, "Who asked us to un
derstand?" Only believe is the com
mand. Life is a mystery.- Every
thing is mysterious. We do not un
derstand our own being. "But who
soever believeth on the Lord Jesus
Christ shall be saved." The music
was extra good. Mr. Webster's vio
lin solo was a treat.
The evening service was a union of
both churches with the sermon by
Rev. Mr. Warner. The subject was,
"How a Man Can Work Miracles."
He spoke particularly of the various
powers by which we are surrounded,
mysterious powers, physical powers,
mental powers and spiritual powers.
The greatest of all being spiritual
power, and he who prays for spirit
ual things will be endowed with a
power by which he can work mira
cles. Barton Casts Most Votes of Any
Town in Orleans County.
Barton again yesterday demon
strated that it is the largest town in
the county by casting 21 more votes
than Newport and 43 more than Der
by. This count does not take into
consideration scattering presidential
vote in any of the towns, but only
counts the Republican and Demo
cratic ballots cast, the only count
available to the Monitor. - Here is
how we voted:
Hughes Wilson Total
Barton 421 133 554
Newport 329 204 533
Derby 347' 164 511
TO RENT Two flats, one on

com siaes.
Early Reports Give Election to Hughes. Later
Given to Wilson. NowBo
Sides Claim It
Popular Vote Very Close in Many j
Stnfps T?pmibicarji Annpar to
Have Gained in Congress.
Early reports last evening gave
every indication that Hughes had
been elected president and at mid
night several Chicago, New York and
Boston dailies admitted that -Hughes
would be elected, and all morning
newspapers declare Hughes the win
ner. At midnight news was given
out that Hughes had more than
electoral votes enough to win.
But this forenoon returns from
several states where the popular vote
was very close have changed these
figures to some exent and just before
noon the news was circulated that
Wilson had won by four electoral
votes.
The Monitor has made every effort
to confirm this report but has only
this to report. Chairman McCormick
of the De -:iocratic national committee
claims 2L3 electoral votes, while only
206 arc necessary for election.
Chairman Wilcox of the Republican
national committee is just as positive
in his statement that Hughes has
carried California and Minnesota,
two disputed states, and has won.
News reporting agencies admit
that it will probably be another day
before positive and final results will
be known. At least the contest is
very close.

Literal Club Hallowe'en Party.
The annual Hallowe'en party of the
Woman's Literary club was held at
the home of Mrs. H. W. Carter on the
evening of Nov. 1st and was the
most pretentious and entertaining
function of its kind ever held by the
club. Mrs. Carter was a most char
ming hostess and the house was at
tractively decorated in orange and
black and with lighted jack-o-lan-terns.
Its straw butlers and lackeys
lent much to the weirdness of the oc
casion. After a short business meet
ing a program consisting of an arti
cle on the origin of Hallowe'en, was
read by Mrs. Zuar Hanson and Miss
Redfield sang, "Will-o-the-Wisp" by
Spear and responded to an encore by
giving the "Japanese Death Song,"
by Earl Sharp. Miss Kate Ferrin
read "The Jewel Box," a selection ap
propriate to the occasion. Following
the program there was an hour of
real Hallowe'en stunts with witches
and goblins .galore, until even the
bravest of the brave had difficulty in
keeping their hair from taking sud
den upward flights. The uncanny
pitch-dark lunch didn't seem to ap
peal to the members as being soul
satisfying and therefore the company
adjourned to the dining room, where
a most excellent collation had been
prepared and where once more in the
glow of the electrics, spirits began to
rise and. such things as the shivery
oyster and the apex of the porker
were forgotten. Certainly a very
pleasant evening was enjoyed by all
of the thirty-odd members who were
present.
Mrs George A. Sylvester of Nash
ua, N. H., is a guest at the home of
her brother, F. D. Thompson.
, Clyde Heath, who has been coach
ing the football team of the Randolph
Agricultural school, has returned
home. -
The infant child of Mr. and Mrs.
Arthur Labor, who has been very ill,
died at the Mrs. Lucy Robinson place
Saturday.
L. P. Case, another of Barton's old
est inhabitants, died Sunday after
weeks of intense suffering, and seve
ral years of declining health. An
obituary- will appear later.
( Continued on Page Eight)
Brownington Foundling Speaks Three
Words.
The child left on the steps of the C. ;
W. Skinner place in East Browning
ton before daylight a week ago Sun
day morning by a passing automobile,
says three words that may be a clue
to the finding of its parents.
When an automobile passes the
house the child will run to the door or
window and cry, "Mamma!" It also
says "papa" and "grandpa." From
the actions of the boy, which physi
cians say is 15 or 16 months old.
Overseer T. G. Crandall believes the
child comes from a family where an
automobile is in use and a family
whdre there are three, a father, moth
er and grandfather.
Mr. Crandall believes the clothing
the child wore was made up and put
onto the child for the occasion and he
i
believes it to be the work of a man.
The sewing on the hood looked like a
man';-: attempt and the shirt the child
wore was a man's garment cut down,
while the stockings were many sizes
too small for the child. It was a
"botched" mess, as Mr. Crandall ex
presses it, and not the clothes of a
merely destitute child. The baby has
every appearance of coming from a
family of at least comfortable circum
stances as he has been well fed, and
as those who have seen him say, is
sweet and very attractive.
A red and black horse blanket was
wrapped around the child when it was
left. The blanket shows considerable
wear from the thills and was appar
ently used as a street blanket.
Again the Monitor asks, "Why and
by whom was the child left?"

Mrs. Mary Morrill.'
Mrs. Mary Morrill, whose death
was mentioned last week as occur
ring Wednesday morning, November
1, was born in Sheffield May 19, 1833,
and was therefore 83 years of age.
Her maiden name was Mary Bean.
She married John Ross in 1855,
and he died in 1879. She married
Charles E. Morrill in 1895 and they
came to Barton and bought the place
on Park street where she has lived
since. Mr. Morrill died in 1903 and
his nephew, A. W. Morrill, came to
Barton in May, 1904, and has lived
with her since.
She leaves one brother, John Bean,
of Springfield, Mass.; three nieces,
Lettie Locke of Lakeport, N. H., Mrs
Robert French of St. Johnsbury and
Mrs. W. H. Ford of Springfield, and
one nephew, D. D. Bean of St. Johns
bury. Mrs. Morrill was one of Barton's
oldest citizens, and a woman very
highly spoken of by all who knew
her and her life before her years of
decline.
The funeral was held from the
house Friday, Rev. W. A. Warner of
ficiating, and interment was at St.
Johnsbury.

Warner on "Politics." Mrs. Ida Cut
ler gave a very excellent paper on,
"Origin and History of the Political
Parties of the United States." Miss
Marion Redfield, accompanied " by
Mrs. Florence Pillsbury, sang in a
pleasing manner, "Oh! Love Thrice
Aid" from Samson and Delilah and
"A Spirit Flower" by, Campbell Tip
ton;' paper, "Our Flag in Civil and
Military Life," Mrs. Lucy Robinson;
reading, "The Making of the Flag,"
Miss Fanny May; "Snapshots of

Spangled' Banner." Mrs. George
Lang played several selections on a
Victrola during the social time fol
lowing the meeting and the domestic
science class under the direction of
Miss Pierpont, teacher, served re
freshments in a very satisfactory
manner.
CROCKETT ON "LAKE
REGION OF VERMONT."
Says One of the Important Hotels of
New England Should Be on
Willoughby. State Will
Issue Book
Editor Monitor:
In accordance with your sugges
tion I yill give you a brief descrip
tion of a trip which I took through
northeastern Vermont recently in or
der to secure material and photo
graphs for a book which the state
publicity bureau proposes to publish,
describing the lake region of north
eastern Vermont. '
The party consisted of Miss Kath
erine Bingham, stenographer, and
her father, C. C. Bingham, of St.
Johnsbury, a chauffeur, and myself.
Leaving St. Johnsbury on the
morning of Thursday, Oct. 5, we pro
ceeded directly north through Lyn
don, making a slight detour to view
the beautiful place of Theodore N.
Vail, and thence on through Burke
and Sutton to Willoughby lake and
Westmore. It would be like "carry
ing coals to Newcastle" to attempt to
tell readers of your paper anything
new about the beauties of Lake Wil
loughby. This lake was never more
beautiful or impressive than in its
autumnal forest setting on this day.
It seems to me, as it has to many
others, that somewhere around this
lake there ought to be one of the im
portant summer hotels of New En
gland. Surely one would have to
travel far to find a scene more beau
tiful, and in these days of automo
biles a dstance of a few miles from, a
railroad station ought not to prohib
it the erection of such a hotel.
From Willoughby lake we proceed
ed to Crystal lake in Barton. The
scene from the northern end of this
body of water, looking down the full
length of the lake, is one that re
quires an abundant supply of adjec
tives for description and I found that
very early in this tour my supply of
adjectives became exhausted.
From Barton we proceeded north
ward through lrasburg and Coventry,
taking the route on the eastern shore
of South bay, an extens ion of Lake
Memphremagog. It was just after
sunset, and that night there was a
wonderful afterglow which tinted the
waters almost a blood red, giving a
striking effect to the scene, but un
fortunately one that could not be
photographed.
From Newport we proceeded the
next morning to a point above West
Derby, where a particularly fine view
of Lake Memphremagog may be ob
tained. Proceeding from there
through the town of Derby we came
to Salem pond, a particularly good
view of which is obtained just after
passing through a picturesque forest
glade, and from Salem pond we mo
tored through West Charleston,
passed a power plant where there
was a pretty waterfall, and over the
hills of Morgan to Seymour lake.
This lake is not as well known as it
deserves. It is one of the larger
lakes of Vermont, excluding Cham
plain and Memphremagog, being
about four miles long and nearly
two miles wide. Its shape is said to
resemble, in rather a crude fashion,
that of a man's boot. It is fed by
numerous springs and its waters are
pure "and cold. It is said that this
lake does not freeze as soon as other
bodies of water in the vicinity.
There are large areas of maple for
ests in the town of Morgan, and no
ordinary vocabulary will do justice
to the autumnal foliage at this season
of the year. I have seen many glori
ous views of this kind, but I think I
never saw such wonderful scarlets
and crimsons and golden yellows as I
saw on this trip. The colors were so
vivid that one would not believe that
forest leaves could be painted in such
rich colors by nature unless he saw
them with his own eyes. These bril
liant colors mingled with the dark
evergreens, made a scene long to be
remembered, while in the far distance
stretched away the great mountain
ranges with their softer colors like
the rich hues of a beautiful Persian
rug, or a costly tapestry.
If only color photography had been
perfected so that these gorgeous col
ors could be presented to the eye by
means of the camera, then Vermont
could not contain the number of peo
ple who would desire to see the Green
Mountain state in its autumnal glory.
One wishes that the people of the
great cities might be more familiar
with what Vermont has to offer at
this season of the year.
From Morgan we proceeded direct
ly to Island Pond, where there is a
charming pond containing a pictur
esque island which gives its name to
the village.
From here our trip took us through
an unsettled portion of Essex county
where an excellent road passes
Ferdinand into Brunswick. Only a
few lumber camps are to be found in
Ferdinand. The approach to the
Connecticut valley, with the White

TRAINING CLASS NOTES
Miss Mildred Curtis visited the
training room Friday morning.
' We heard a very interesting debate
about the coming presidential cam
paign given by Miss Ferrin's second
English class on Friday morning.
The girls of the training class were
very glad to have Miss Patrick back
with them after a week's absence.
Monday morning was spent in telling
Miss Patrick of our visits to the rural
schools and in asking her opinion
about many things that puzzled us.
Tuesday morning we visited the
school at Orleans. .We did a little
observation work in each of the nine
grades and during the last period of
the morning Mr. Fletcher very kindly
snowed us that part of the school of
which Orleans should be proud, the
greenhouse, farm, poultryhouse and
small creamery. After we left the
school building we decided to finish
the trip by going through the veneer
mills. Mr. Doe very kindly explained
in detail every step of the work. Just
before we started home a member of
the senior class kindly invited us to
attend a Hallowe'en party to be given
that evening. ..The three girls that
stayed for the party aeclared no day
could have been finished more success
fully. EPWORTH LEAGUE SOCIAL FOR
SCHOOL.
Monday evening, Oct. 30, the Ep
worth League gave a social at the
church in honor of the high school.
The rooms were tastefully decorated
in orange and black and an immense
pumpkin adorned the center table- in
the parlor. Such a large number
gathered that we adjourned to the
lawn for a game of drop the hand
kerchief, but were soon called back
in order that the girls might go up in
the aeroplane. Meanwhile a witch
told fortunes in a prettily decorated
booth. It is great to know your life
fortune while you are still in high
school and nearly everyone became
acquainted with his. A hunt for a
ring, a thimble and a piece of money
took up several amusing minutes; a.
mysterious pie of flour was cut in
more pieces than a pie usually is, but
someone found a ring placed therein.
Other games and contests were in
dulged in until we were called up
stairs, one class at a time, for re
freshments. The refreshments were
very appropriate for the occasion,
such as pumpkin pie, fruit and pea
nuts. A large number attended the
social and everyone spent a very
pleasant and enjoyable evening.

Bloodhound Trails Insane Eden Man.
An interesting story comes from
Eden about the trailing of an insane
man by a bloodhound.
It seems that a young man, the son
of a Mr. Whittemore, is insane. He
was confined in a room in the house,
but made an escape clad in a pair of
trousers and shoes.
Word of the escape was sent to the
authorities, who got in touch with J.
L. Whitehill of Fairhaven, who owns
"Red Panther," a full-blooded En
glish bloodhound. The dog, in charge
of G. C. Kmcaid, who was accompan
ied by Superintendent Loukes of the
house of correction at Rutland; and
Edward Root left in the evening by
automobile for Eden, traveling all
night and arriving at Eden at 7
o'clock the next morning.
They went at once to the house of
Mr. Whittemore. The room had been
cleaned and the floor mopped so that
no scent could be obtained there.
From the steps over which the
young man had passed 36 hours be
fore the dog took the scent which he
followed for two miles in the woods to
a point where the insane man had
been seen. From this point the dog
led Mr Kincaid for seven miles toward
Lowell.
To save time the animal was then
taken off the trail anl was given the
scent at a log which young Whitte
more had been seen to cross. The ani
mal followed the trail until dark.
It was then decided that as the- man
could travel much faster than the dog
with a trailer could follow, it would
be wise to surround the mountain.
The dog was taken off the trail and
150 men set out in an attempt to lo
locate,the missing man.
"Red Panther" is four years old and
has been used successfully ' in 185
cases in many parts of the world.
The young man was not found for
several days but was then found by
George O'Brien in a pasture about
four miles from his home. He was
asleep in a hut that he had built and
when awakened went home readily.
He had lived on apples, beech nuts and
occasionally secured milk and cream
from a nearby farmer, unbeknown to
the owner.
