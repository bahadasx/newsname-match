fifty.
Th?: assistant draw tender. Timothy

Democratic managers insisted that
complete returns from the West would
reverse the trend which steadily
seemed to be piling up the Hughes

"Remember 1K&2" was the predic
tion of the Democratic publicity bu
reau. which pointed out that in that
memorable contest the next day's re
