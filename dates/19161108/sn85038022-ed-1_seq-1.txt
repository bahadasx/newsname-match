New York (Special). Charles E
Hughes was elected President of the
United States at Tuesday's election.
That was the verdict of the 13,000,
000 men and the 3.000,ouu women
voters of the nation.
Former Justice Hughes carried all of
New England; New York, Illinois, In
diana, Pennsylvania, Ohio and prac
tically all of the Central and North
western States.
The next House of Representatives
la safely Republican, while Demo
crats retain slight control of the Sen
ate. Tbe Republicans elected gover
nors In New Hampshire, Vermont,
Connecticut, New York, Illinois and
Ohio.
The state of New York was carried
for Hughes by a plurality of more
than 100.000. Illinois and Indiana
were carried by big pluralities. All
of tbe New England States and New
Jersey were removed from the list of
doubtful states.
Women Furnish Surprise.
The women furnished the surprise
to the Democrats of New York. They
voted for the first time. There were
800,000 or tbeni at the polling places
during the day. The Democrats con
fldently predicted because of the pacl
flat Issue the women would fairly
storm tbe pulls with their votes for
the President, but thay didn't. In
many sections they voted as the
women In all the other equal fran
chise stales have alwaya voted with
their husbands, brothers or other
mals kin.
The labor vote In some of the rail
way camera or Illinois caused a defec
tion In the normal Republican vote,
but the swing of business man to the
atapubllcan ticket made up for Ibis
election and the state retained Ra
In the column where It always
until four years ago. whan It
want awry in the three ooruered fight
far the presidency
Indiana. Michigan and V.'laoonaln
vara looked upon as slalee aa likely to
be found wandering from laslr ha
Miual pleoee la a year whan the po-
MUael sky was Sib with
but these atates will give their eleo
torsi votes to the Republicans. Wis
consin, because of tha LaFolette cam
paign for Senator he had praised the I
Wilson administration and Ignored
Hughes--was counted on almost con
fidently by the Democrats to linn up
for the President. The Badger State
will give lta 13 votes to Hughes.
Charles E. Hughes was at the Astor
Hotel Members of his family wero j
with him. He was particularly inter- j
ested In hearing the returns from his I
own state.. When he was assured that I
the stste would give him Its electoral
vote he called "everything off" for tha
time being and ordered a good dinner.
He had not spent much time dining
during the closing days of his cam
paign. There was at no time doubt
In his mind that he would be elected.
He had not bean cast down by the
stories of Republican defections which
gave such optimism to the Democrats
and at times sent gloom to the hearts
of some of the Republican managers.
, Defections In G. O. P. Vote.
That there was defections in the
Republican vote was plainly evident
from a study of the returns from many
states If In fact not from all states.
Massachusetts showed a decided Wll
son trend. No one suspected that tho
Bay State, a citadel of Republicanism,
would go Democratic, but its peculiar
actions nevertheless caused some mild
qualms in the hearts of the Repub
licans. It was finally Indicated that the ma
jority there would be at least 10,000,
and, while this is not more than one
fifth of what the Hay State usually
goes, the Republicans were satisfied
to get the 18 electoral votes by any
margin.
Connecticut, which has been flooded
with Wilson sentiment, due to the.
large army of munitions workers and
the remarkable prosperity of the state,
threatened to go Democratic, as had
been Indicated In the straw votes
taken by various newspapers in that
part of the country, but the state turn
ed and gave a respectable plurality
for the Republicans.
The great army of factory workers
lo the cities swung strongly for the
President and some of the Democratic
newspapers of the state laid claim to
the state by 10,000 plurality.
Twss Not a Landslide.
The election was not a Republican
landslide, although the vote In New
York suggested that it might be. It
showed a heavy Democratic gain for
President Wilson.
Labor, from all that could be ascer
tained, did not "stick" to the Presi
dent. Wherever labor gathered dur
ing the six weeks prior to election the
sentiment was almost unanimous for
the President, because he had placed
his official approval upon the principle
or the eight-hour law.
It was reared by the Republicans
that the solid labor vote would be for
the President, and in that case the
election or the President would have
been reasonably assured. It was evi
dent also that the number or fanners
throughout the country voting Tor the
President, because they are receiving
high prices for their crops and because
there Is no war, had been greatly ex
aggerated. The eleventh-hour swing away from
the President, which had given new
confidence to the Republicans and in
fluenced the betting odds, turned out
to be not so mythical as had been Im
agined by the Democrats. Returns
coming in indicated that the elec
tion of Hughes was assured, but
there would be nothing Ilka tha
overwhelming majority In the Elec
toral College that some of the Kepub
licans had predicted. The most sur
prising thing of all was the small vote
or Ttmmany Hall, although it was
stated on the very best of authority
that tha Tammany leaders were wall
aware, in the last days or tbe cam
paign, that the vote would be surpris
ingly small.

Louisville (Special) Kentucky gave
a majority in excess of 1G.000 for the
Wilson and Marshall ticket at Tuesday
election. All or the present Congress
men nine Democrats and two Kepub
licans were re-elected. The weather
was perfect and the voting was the
heaviest In a decade. The election
was probably the most orderly ever
conducted In Kentucky.
The gains shown by Wilson over the
presidential vote for Bryan in 1908 and
over the gubernatorial vote ror Stan
ley In 1915 were larger than were ex
pected by Democratic State Campaign
Chairman J. Campbell Cantrlll. and
they were, to say the least astounding l
to Republican Campaign Chairman
Ludlow F. Petty. The largeet relative
gain shown was In Daviess county.
I he rc Hulta of the election in Mason
county came in rather rast last night
with the results of 6n7 Democratic ma
jority. The Commission Form of flov-
sragMM vote stood 24 1 in is gfw
c Incts. i ,ii i ne about six to one.
The results In Mason county were
very gratifying to the Democratic
barters but the results from other
states show that the approximate 700
v s not needed very badly, unly
tlreo precincts went Republican. Sec
ern! nnd Sixth Wards and Washington.
I'lnmvllle, the Inst precinct to report
went one Democratic Elsewhere in
Mie paper will be round the vote in
each piecinct. and although these re
sults have not been fully verified, the
are a representative vote and the cor
rected results will not change the to
la! more than five Of six votes either
way.
Thp Commission Form of (lovern
inont carried about fi to 1. The Sixth
Ward was the only one to put any
fi'-'ht aSalnat the change, the vote
there being 149 to 108. Oermantown
voted 130 for and I against the
chance. Snrdls gave the lar esl ma
jority for Ihe Commission Form, IN
