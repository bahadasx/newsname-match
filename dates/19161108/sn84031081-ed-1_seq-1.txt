up to 2 o'clock tins raeniwfi om
Ions distance telephone report from
Koswell was to the effect that Chavel

1,400 majority and that the four coun

Hportl also stated that, contrary to
predictions, Lieutenant Governor de
Hura was running very little, if any.
behind his ticket. This report was
Nrifled by the flguroe from three
i'Iloou rmintv i.recincts which Have
wiImmi gig to Hughes 1 1 7 and de Baca
ill to Buraum 119.
The same difficulty in Retting re
turns from the strongly republican
counties of northern Mexico was
ptrieaced as in the Pecos valley, hut
that which was obtainable was all to
the effect that the republican ma
jorities had been materially reduced.
Por instance, In the precinct of Cha

An unexpected feature of the race
that so far as the heads of the ticket
cinic rued, there was little or no
ntehkng. Tin- prediction that the
sous valley democrats would refuse

as was also the case with Ihe na-
