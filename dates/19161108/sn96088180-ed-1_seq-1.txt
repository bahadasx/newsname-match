ELECTION FAILS
TO SHAKE STOCKS
New York, Nor. 8. The New York
Sun financial review said today:
"While the stock market today re
flected to some extent the varying un
certainties In the outcome of the pre
sidential election, the same 'feeling
whk'h has prevailed throughout the
campaign resulted little as a market
factor, as seen In today's trading.
"There was an accumulation of
buying orders over the election recess
which were put through when the
market opened and which carried
prices quickly to higher levels.
"The trading was very brisk and
the tone of the market buoyant In
the first hour of the session. Follow
ing Steel Common, Central (Leather
went forward in a brbad movement
to above 110, a gain of six points or
thereabouts. Sloes Sheffield, Republic
Steel and Bethlehem also sold at re
cord prices, the last named at 684,
an advance of 15 points 'from Mon
day." LOWDEN ELECTED
