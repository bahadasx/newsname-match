McCormick Fails to Carry Pre
cinct, Ward, City or
State
Dauphin county, which gave a ma
jority to Colonel Theodore Roosevelt
four years ago, swung into the Repub
lican column yesterday with a plural- j
ity of 2,148 for Charles Evans Hughes j
and a plurality of 4,592 for Senator |
Edward E. Beidleman who led his j
ticket. All of the Republican candi- j
dates in the city and county won, with j
the exception of Augustus Wildman, j
who was defeated by Ramsey Black, \
Democrat, for one of the city's legisla- |
tive seats in a close fight.
Much interest was attached to the !
vote in Dauphin county throughout the \
State because of the fact that it is the
home county of the Democratic na
tional chairman, who, by the way,
failed to get a majority for Wilson in j
his precinct, his ward, his city, his
county or his State. Another thing
which caused unusual interest in Dau
phin county was the strenuous effort j
made by the Democrats to win over J
the Progressives, who seem to have
4# preferred the advico- oi • Rooaoyolfr-to 4-
that of McCormick.
Congressman Aaron S. Kreider who
was re-elected by a substantial ma
jority, carried Dauphin county, includ
ing Harrlsburg city which gave him a
fine vote, received a splendid testi
monial from his neighbors in Lebanon
and a good vote in Cumberland.
Justice Emory A. Walling, who had
the endorsement of the Dauphin
county lawyers, was loyally supported
not only in Dauphin but in the other
counties of this district. Returns indi
cate that the vote for him in the State I
will run many thousands above that
for Charles Palmer.
Vote For President
Justice Hughes carried both the citv
and the county having a total of 6,551
votes in the city and 7,306 in the !
county, an aggregate of 13,877. Wil
son had 6,041 votes in the city, and
5,395 in the county, a total of 11,439.
Benson, Socialist, had 330 in the city,
505 in the county, a total of 835 and
Hanly, Prohibition, got 195 in Har- I
risburg and 213 in the county, a total I
of 408.
By far the most interesting contest
in the county was that for State sena
tor. Dr. William N. Yates, the Wash
ington party candidate who was run
ning on a local option platform, was
a poor third despite the fact that he
had the covert support of the news
paper of the Democratic national chair
man. Owing to this fact Alderman
George D. Herbert's friends consider
that he made a remarkable showing,
having 4,249 votes in the city and 4,095
in the county, or a total of 8,344 as com
pared with 2.256 for Yate!j in the city
and 1,318 in the county, a total of 3,604.
Senator Beidleman simply walked
away with his two opponents, having a
vote of 6,253 In Harrlsburg and 6,943
in the county outside, a grand total
of 13,190. This gives him a plurality
of 4,592 and a clear majority over all I
of 1,248. The Senator will be re-elcted I
president pro tern of the State Senate
in January.
For United States Senator Phil
ander C. Knox pollea 6,755 votes in
the city and 6,405 in the county, a to
tal of 13,160 as compared with 6,191
votes for Ellis L. Orvis, the Democra
tic candidate in the city and 4,360 in
the county, a total of 10,155.
Senator Charles A. Snyder, who is a
native of the upper end of Dauphin
county, won a fine vote in the city
and county, having 6,985 in the city
and 6,967 in the county, a total of 13 -
952. James Murrin, his rival for Audi
tor General, received 4,780 votes in the
city and 4,597 in the county—a total
of 9,377.
Harmon M. Kephart, for State
Treasurer, polled a total of 13,556 in
the county, the city giving him 6,671
and the county districts and boroughs
6,885. Jamos M. Cramer, Democratic
candidate, had a total of 10,361, the
'ity giving 5,64 4 and the county out
side 4,717.
The vote for Congressman Kreider in
Harrlsburg was 6,300 and in the coun
ty districts 6,737, a total of 13,037 as
compared with 5,727 in Harrlsburg
and 4,821 in the county for H. B.
Saussaman, his Democratic rival
Saussaman got a total 10,548.
The Republican Congressmen-at
large carried the county by figures
approximating those of Kreider.
Justice Walllng's vote in the city
was 6,388 and in the county 4,063 a
total of 9.451. Charles Palmer re
ceived 3,927 In the city and 2,938 in
the county, or 6.85 all told.

Harrlsburg may have gone to bed
late last night or early this morning
decidedly perplexed as to whether
Mr. Hughes or Mr. Wilson is to be
President of the United States but it
had no doubt at all as to the question
of the two important city problems.
The $1,250,000 high school loan
was passed by the comfortable ma
jority of nearly 2200. Just 6549 votes
were cast for the loan and 4 363
against it.
The amendment to the jitney or
