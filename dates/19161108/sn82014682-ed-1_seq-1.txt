"Hoost for Hawaii first. Then keep

"Sunny Jim" McCandless in his talk
before the members of the Ad Club
at the lunch today at the Alexander
Young Hctel. 'Practical advertising
counts, and does more good than any
one other: thing," said McCandless.
"In my trips throughout the coun
try I have found that advertising that
Is i Tactical pay?. We had an example
at Seattle and San Francisco. A man
hy the name of Child had an exhibit in
San Francisco that did more good for
Hawaii than the Hawaii Iiomotion
Committee or the Hawaii fmilding.
That was practical advertising. He
sold pineapples and made $:;o,'i'o for
himself. .
'.'-'"Kverywhere on the mainland, the
people have taken an interest in lla
w aiian mus'c, and I have heard it
everywhere. In San Francisco the
Great Northern held Hawaii Day. and
this was a boost. In this connection
I wish to say that I believe that the
people of Hawaii are making a mis
take by. having a man as their repre
sentative in San Francisco Who has
only visited the islands once. This is
Fred J. Halton. He is a good adver
tising man. but doesn't understand
Hawaii and den't know how to talk
it." -V; :;i .'
One of the features of. the meeting
today was the appearance of Miss Mar

entertained the members with three
violin selections. M.iss Stevens has
recently returned from her studies
under Alexander Stewart in Oakland,
and her rendition of "Legende," hy

at. the request of the members. With
out doubt this musical feature was
one of the best received in the history

NEW YORK, N. Y., Nov. 8. With choice of president in
an almost unprecedented status of doubt, Democratic and Re
publican headquarters are scenes of nervous activity and
tension. - I--,;
Although both sides claimed majorities in the electoral col

final results may be prolonged owing to the doubtful states. .
NEW YORK, N. Y., Nov. 8. It is rumored here that on
account of the sensational closeness of the presidential fight a
decision will eventually be thrown to the house of represent
atives. Actual returns, considering the definite and indicative
figures which experts count on, give Wilson 232 electoral votes
and Hughes 212.
The result appears to depend principally on California,
Minnesota, Oregon and Indiana.
