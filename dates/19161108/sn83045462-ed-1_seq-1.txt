that an official count may be needed to
determine the result. Minnesota is also
very close, and in New Hampshire the
victory may be determined by 500 votes.
While Indiana is also in the doubtful
column, today's returns showed Mr.
Hughes leading President "Wilson there
by a little more than 10.000 votes, with
about 1.000 precincts to be heard from.

The most spectacular changes within

NEW YORK. November 8. ? "
When the republican landslide in New i *
York became known and was quickly | *
followed by the heavy republican vie- j
tories in New England, there was a ja
veritable stampede to announce the :
election of Mr. Hughes and the defeat i tl
of President Wilson. e
Hundreds of thousands waiting in the r
streets saw the signal lights flash the p
defeat of the President. New York news- ^
j papers which have been prominent in jj
I their support of him conceded the Presi- a
| sident's defeat even before some of the p
1 western states had been heard from. e
I Thousands of persons in the east
went to bed believing Mr. Hughes ?
elected and woke up this morning to ; r
! And the result apparently changed ! jr
} while they slept. Hundreds who made j c
j their plans for what they expected to j t'j
happen in Wall street today found them '
set all awry. I e
The first figures of Wilson majorities '
through the west did not shake the
confidence of those who w;ere predict- |
ing the election of Mr. Hughes, and <
not until the steady stream of Wilson j
majorities began eating the Hughes j
columns piled up in the east did any;0
of them suspect that the result was in j o

afternoon still keeping in the doubt- s
ful column. *
The Senate, upon the authority of the r
Associated Press reports, will be democratic
by a slender majority only. On the tj
same authority the House of Representatives
shows a gain of nine for the republi- a
cans, reducing the present democratic ma- V
t jority of twenty-three to five. Two democratic
districts in New Jersey, however,
I which are reported doubtful, if reversed
i jttnoae island, Delaware and Utah,
ndications pointed strongly to a
urther democratic loss of two senaors
in Indiana, one in West Virginia
nd Arizona and possibly one in Montana.
Late returns from Ohio indicating
tie re-election of Senator Atlee Pomrene,
democrat, over Myron T. HerIck,
republican, virtually ended the
ossibility of republican ascendency in
he Senate. With democratic leaders
isisting that Hitchcock in Nebraska
nd Pittman in Nevada have been relected,
and With Kendrick probably
lected in Wyoming, the political stalls
of the new Senate would thus be:
Jemocrats, 52; republicans, 42; with the
esult in Arizona and New Mexico still
l doubt. Should the republicans
arry both the democratic majority in
he Senate would be eight.
The democretic majority in the presnt
Senate is sixteen.
Gerry Defeats Lippitt.
The most surprising development in
he senatorial contest was the defeat
f Senator Henry F. Lippitt, republican,
f Rhode Island by Peter Goelet Gerry,
emocrat, as the state otherwise went
epublican.
To the republicans this was a bolt
rom a clear sky. William M. Calder
f New York takes the place of Sentor
O'Gorman, easily defeating Wiliam
F. McCombs, former chairman of
he democratic national committee.
Lewis Loses in Maryland.
The defeat of Senator James B. Marine
of New Jersey by Joseph S. Frelpghuysen
had been persistently herJded
by republican leaders. The
lemocrats lost their first senator in
he September election in Maine when
Frederick Male won from Senator
'harles F. Johnson. Another surprisng
defeat to the democrats came in
Maryland, where Joseph I. France won
rom Representative David J. ]> wis,
he latter having won the democratic
lomination from Senator Blair Bee in
he primary.
The fight, waged on Representative
luchanan. democrat, of Illinois, was
uccessful, as his district will be repesented
by Niels Juul, republican. One
tf the upsets occurred in the sixtl
Maryland district, where Frederick
hhlman, republican, will succeed Daid
J. Lewis, who was defeated for the
Senate by Dr. France, republican. Repesentative
Oakey, a republican frorr
he Hartford (Conn.) district, and i
nember of the Mouse District1 commitee,
was defeated by A. Loner;?an, democrat,
who was a member of the Sixtyhird
Congress.
Although democratic chieftains were
oping against hope that complete reurns
would reverse the situation in
ndiana, the indications at this time
re that both John W. Kern, majority
?ader of the Senate, and Thomas Tagart
inust yield to Harry S. New and

erms respectively.

Both parties, however, are claimng

Sutherland Defeated.
Another upset was the defeat of Re>ublican
Senator George Sutherland
>f Utah by William II. King, democrat.
Sutherland has been in the Senate for
lixteen years. Late returns also indiated
that Senator du Pont of Delaware
vould lose his seat to the democratic
tomiitee, Josiah O. Wolcott.
Senator Clark of Wyoming appeared
o be encountering trouble in his contest

statement:
"During the night I have been in

munication with different parts of the

i "As it requires 266 electoral votes to

more than necessary for his election."
I Mr. Willcox, speaking at 10:30 o'clock,
j said the election was close, and dej

Chairman Willcox of the republican
national committee at 12:50 o'clock issued
this statement:
"California and Minnesota are surely
for Hughes. This means Hughes is
elected."
The statement, he said, was based upon
advices from the respective state headquarters,
claiming California by 10.000
votes and Minnesota by 20.000. Chester

declaration that California is now

By the Associated Press.
SAN FRANCISCO, November 8.?Returns
available early today indicated
that the contest between Wilson and
Hughes in California was so close that
an official count might be necessary to
determine the result. With 2,152 precincts
in various parts of the state, out
of a total of 5,917 accounted for, the
President was leading by about 700
votes.
Owing to the exceptional length of
the ballot, few precincts have been reported
in either San Francisco or Los i
Angeles, and on the result of the count
in those two cities hinged the outcome.
Wilson Gets San Francisco.
In San Francisco the city registrar j
estimated that Wilson would have a
majority of 20,000. Whether this would
overcome the majority certain to be
rolled up for Hughes in southern Cali
forma was the point with which election
experts concerned themselves.
Gov. Hiram W. Johnson, republican
and progressive candidate for United
States senator, had a commanding lead i
over his democratic opponent, George
S. Hatton, and it was believed his majority
would approximate 200,000.

BALTIMORE REMAINS 'WET
BALTIMORE. Md., November ?.?
President Wilson carried Maryland in
yesterday's election by a plurality estimated
at 16,510, but Representative
David J. Lewis, "Father of the Parcel
Post," was defeated in the contest for
the United States senatorship by Dr.
Josepti i. France, whose estimated
plurality was 6.367.
Lewis' defeat was attributed'largely
to the openly expressed hostility of
the democratic organization in Baltimore
city and to the anti-prohibitionists,
because of his vote in Congress
for a national prohibition amendment.
Baltimore city, which gave President
Wilson 9,300 plurality, gave Dr. France
9,782 plurality.
Republicans Gain One.
Four democrat and two republican
representatives were elected, a republican
gain of one. In addition to the
five incumbents, Frederick N. Zihlman
of Cumberland, republican, was elected
from the sixth district, formerly represented
by Mr. Lewis.
Prohibition was defeated in seven of
eleven localities in which the proposition
was voted upon in the state. Baltimore
city gave a majority against it of
[43,000. Annapolis, rejected it by 500,
! while Havre de Grace, at which pacing
is conducted, went "dry" by twenty-two
votes. Hagerstown voted dry.

IN MARYLAliO ELECTION
J. Altheus Johnson Says Result Is
the Beflection of True
Americanism.
The result of the election in .Maryland
was a triumph for true American
ideals, said J. Altheus Johnson of Seat Pleasant,
Prince Georges county, discussing
the returns.
"Maryland normally is democratic,**
Mr. Johnson said, "but the state la not
socialistic in thought, and the vote yes
terday emphasizes the fact that In
Maryland there are good men in the
democratic party who desire to check
what is very noticeable in the party
under its present leaders, namely, the
tendency to false theories of government,
theories contrary to American
ideals as cherished by both democrata
and republicans. Individualism in government,
as opposed to socialism, is a
fundamental with both democrats and
republicans, despite the fact that the
democrat, in our dual system, is disposed
to emphasize the state, and the
republican the nation.
"Government, according to our American
ideals, can regulate and restrain,
but ought not to destroy or eliminate
individual enterprise and activity, and
those who, for economic ills, would seek
remedies in government ownership of !
the public utilities, or in other phases
of state socialism, are not imbued with
the principles of true Americanism,
and democrats and republicans alike
are concerned to protect the inner sanctuaries
of the government from the
baneful influence of such un-Araerican
notions.
"They are foreign to the free institn- ]
tions which foster and IftM J
Liberty of the individual^
