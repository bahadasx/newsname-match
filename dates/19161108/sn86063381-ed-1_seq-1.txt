tion of duties on wheat crossing the
United States border from Canada,
and a lower duty on foodstuffs going

Canadian Council of Agriculture,
which opened a three days' session

Possibility of forming a farmers'
political party will be discussed dur
ing the convention, R. McKensie,

trol of elevators and abolition of
speculation in wheat.
An economic unrest in Canada's ru
ral districts is spreading to the towns

in the woods at this early date. They
have five camps near Gemmell, em
ploying between four and five hun
dred men. The I. W. W.s are re
ported on the job there and are said
to be stirring up discontent among
the men, making it hard to keep the
camps filled.
