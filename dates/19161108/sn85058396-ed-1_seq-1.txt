It
J New York, Nov. 8. With .the coun-
,j try's choice of a president in the al-
most unprecedented status of doubt on
j the day after election both Democratic
and Republican headquarters wero
; scenes of nervous activity and ten-
l sion. Although both sides claimed
; majorities in the electoral college,
j; there seemed nevertheless to be a
-j feeling at both places there was a
,j chance that the determination of the
final result with so many states doubt-
' H ful might be prolonged perhaps for
another day and there was some unof-
I ficial talk that the decision might
sj eventually be thrown into the house
, :) of representatives.
J There were suggestions also that
j.j there might be in some states bitter
contests over the integrity of the re-
'; turns which might be drawn out for
J days with the result hinging on a re-
d count George W. Perkins at Repub-
f$ lican headquarters, commenting upon
l the close vote in some states, de-
, clared that a recount might be neces-
' sary. Chairman McCormick early to-
v"a5j I day sent telegrams to every state and
; county chairman where the result ap-
troj , pears close commanding them to per-
njSI I sonally see that the ballot boxes are
guarded and protected.
:Ifi Chairman McCormick shortly after
wfa 11 o'clock claimed President Wilson's
aeta i election with 2S8 electoral votes,
toi ! "i am basing my conclusion on the
M , official canvass of pivotal states," he
9 t added. "It is a sweeping victory."
j Mr. McCormick claimed Kansas
nee 0 with 10 and Ohio with 24 electoral
era ij votes.
Ing Both Sides Claim Election.
Q? I Democratic Chairman McCormick
aZI in a statement declared President Wil-
$ son surely would have 304 votes in
asS, aj the electoral college. Republican
r2 it Chairman Wlllcox at 6 a. m. claimed
?i; f every state generally classed as doubt-
JlS it ful and counted 323 votes for Mr.
jg If Hughes.
hS- j The actual returns, considering def-
yjl Inite and indicative figures, gave Pres-
'M ft ident Wilson 232 votes and Mr.
JH - Hughes 212. On the votes of Califor-
13 f: nia, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Kan-
31 j sas, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New
j-l I Mexico, Oregon, Washington, West
i II Virginia and Wyoming, the decisive
j II ; result on the presidential contest
1 I i turned.
- 'a Safe States for Wilson.
. II , There seemed, to be no doubt that
II j President Wilson had safely carried

II rado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,
' II Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mon
'i II I tana Nebraska, Nevada, North Caro

'fl Steady Wilson Drift.
'I I i From the doubtful states, the re-
1 II t lurns continued to point first toward
J y one candidate and then toward the
other, but toward morning there was
1 noticed a steady drift toward .Prosi-
dent Wilson. 1
-.- i When word went over the country
!f II - PresMent Wilson had been de-
m feated the Republican hosts were ju-
" a II 'I bilant. Although Now England re-
II i turns supported the predictions of a
J l . Republican victory, as the ballot
; J! l counting started in the middle west
jll 1 and on the coast, it dawned on those
3 I ' assembling the vote that President
, j I ' Wilson was far from defeated, that
I- confined to the east and that in the
: states which will make up the ma
t jority in the electoral college a very
! close race was being run.
: Other presidents have been elected
without New York and some of the
so-called pivotal states. Hayes lost
New York and Indiana and five others
to Tllden, but was seated in his close
; contest. While Cleveland carried New
York in each of his successful cam
'v paigns, he lost in one or the other
i of them Indiana, Massachusetts, Ohio,
a Michigan and Pennsylvania.

GREAT MELTING I
HELD IN LONDON
Forming of International Com- ' jH

Prices Being Discussed. i
(Correspondence of the Associated
Press). ;
London, Nov. 8. Representatives of '
thirteen of the trans-Atlantic steam- I
ship lines, in a meeting just held in '
London, listened with great attention
to arguments in favor of the pro- I
posed international commerce com
mission by David Lubin, of New York
and California, who succeeded in get- i
ting through congress resolutions in
dorsing the idea, which has for its ob- J
ject the steadying of prices of staples j
through the fixing of freight rates on j (
ocean bulk traffic j
Mr. Lubin has succeeded in Inter
esting the big shipping men hero in
his plan, among them being Walter rl
Runciman, president of the board of
trade, who is a member of a wealthy , ' f tM
shipping family. The meeting was 115
called by Sir Norman Hill, a great jHi
Liverpool shipping magnate. Among ,
the lines represented were the Amer- IH
ican, Allen, Atlantic Transport, Asso- . j
dated Lines, Canadian Pacific, Cu
nard, Dominion, Furness Withy, Har- Ml
rison, Leyland, White Star and Wil- H
Mr. Lubin's address was followed I'H
by question from practically all at
tending that revealed general interest j
in theplan. To questioners who fear- !H
ed the result of such a strict control ,H
of the lines as to compel them to con- jH
form tospecial rates, Mr. Lubin point-
ed to the .benefits sustained by the iH
railroads in tho United States from IH
the interstate commerce commission's jjH
"Before the interstate commerce (H
commission came into being the price
of tho loading American railway jH
stocks on your market here wero as lf
uncertain as those of common wild- IH
cat schemes offered to the public," ho H
said. "But the stabilizing effect of IhI
the interstate commerce commission's ,H
control has, as you know of your own
personal knowledge, converted them
into tho highest gilt-edged securities," J
