juring her hip. She has been ob­
liged to remain in bed and will pro­
bably have to rest for a week or

TO BURN SLASHING
NORTH OF THE VILLAGE
At the Commercial Club meeting
held last Monday night a commit­
tee consisting of Ed. Toftey, F. R.
Paine, Chas. Taylor, and P. J. Bayle
was appointed to consider the ad­
visability of burning off the slash­
ing just north of the village which
has grown to be a fire menace to
the safety of the village. The com­
mittee after considering the mater
has decided to burn off the slashing
at the first possible favorable op­
portunity.
It is the plan to make a local holi­
day of the affair, getting out all the
men available and to make a good
clean job of the matter. The woods
to the west of the Village is fairly
well burned off and the danger from
that direction is past, for a few
years at least. To the north it con­
sists of slashings piled from four to
ten feet high and when dry would
make a hot fire if fanned by a little
wind. The matter is well worthy of
attention at this time as the brush
getting quite dry and the danger of
burning is the least of any time in
the year.
SUMMARY OF THE
ELECTION RETURNS
The presidental contest is' quite
close and both parties have had their
good and bad turns during the past
twelve hours. At the hour of going
to press the Wilson supporters are
very blue with the Hughes men
hopefully jubiliant but the margin
does not seem to be big enough for
a sure thing.
In regard to our next represen­
tative in the Legislature, the result
is somewhat in doubt but the chan­
ces are for McCullough's election.
The Grand Portage vote is yet to
be received and probably will not
be received for a couple days.
The Telephone Company very ob­
ligingly were on duty all night and
reports were received by the anxi­
ous quite frequently, and the early
news seemed to indicate the elec­
tion of Hughes as the eastern states
gave him landslides in their v6tes.

MILITARY TRAINING IN
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
The militarist party in the United
States is most eager to place mili­
tary training in the Public schools.
Bills were introduced in the last
sesion of the New Jersey Assembly,
providing that all male pupils enter­
ing high school should take a course
in a^my nursing. Despite Europe's
costly and tragic lesson, there are
still those who would promote peace
by preparing for war. There is
more truth than poetry in the ex­
pression that Europe exploded be­
cause she was loaded. Are we will­
ing for our schools to be recruiting
stations for militarism? Shall we
permit the atavistic war spirit to be
bred and carefully nurtured in the
next generation.
The Kansas City Board of Educa­
tion has expressed itself unanimous­
ly in favor of military training in
the public schools. The members of
this board of education are business
men, judges—those who profit by
the present system of society and
are ardent for its defense and pro­
tection. What more natural than
that they should desire every boy in
the country to be reared to protect
and defend that which exists for
their benefit.
One word runs thru the expres­
sion of every one of these board
members. That word is Obedience.
As one judge naively says, I favor
a military education because it tea­
ches the youth to perform duties
without asking questions." Exactly
so. So long as the youth of this
land can be trained to obey without
questioning the commands from a
bove, so long may exploitation rest
secure. The men and women who
constitute a democracy, however,
are not those who obey without
thinking, but are those who think
for themselves. The dogma, "I do
not think I obey", is the dogma
which the ruling class has ever held
up as the ideal for the common peo­
ple. Thru state and church and
schools they have striven to force
uppn. the workers
jot..
the
wo»id. They have offered them hea­
ven as a reward for docility and o
bedience and dangled over them
hell as a punishment for rebellion
against the powers that be—for
daring to think instead of obey. "I
do not obey, I think," is the shib­
boleth of a people awake to their
own interests and capable of gov­
erning themselves without orders
from above.

ALGER SMITH SAWMILL
WILL REOPEN NOV. 20
Garfield Avenue Plant of This Com­
pany, Will be Operated Dur­
ing the Winter
The Garfield avenue sawmilil of the
Alger-Smith Lumber company will be
operated this winter with a large
crew, according to the announcement
by officials of the" company. The
mill is now .closed for repairs but
will be reopened about Nov. 20.
The company is now organizing its
lumber camps in Cook county and
logs will be shipped within the next
week.
The mill will employ 200 men days
and 175 men nights if logs can be
obtained to warrant the mill oper­
ating both day and night shifts.
A hot pond will be utilized in the
handling of the logs. The pond is
kept free of ice by waste steam from
the mill piped into it.
It was proposed last summer to
move the mill to Cascade lake, Cook
county, where it would be closer to
the lumber camps, but it was deci­
ded recently to keep the mill at its
present location. An official of the
company declared that the by-pro­
ducts of the mill, such as slabs and
sawdust, which now find a market
in Duluth, would be a waste. The
mill is now located advantageously
for the sale of finished lumber.—Du

U. S. GOOD ROADS AID
TO BE DISTRIBUTED
Apportionment of $142,000 That the
State Will Receive Under­
taken by Commission.
St. Paul.—Apportionment of $142,
000 that Minnesota is to receive in
the fir^t annual installment of feder­
al good roads aid will be undertaken
at a meeting of the State Highway
commission the latter part of this
week, George W. Cooley, highway
engineer has announced. The main
requirement for aid designation is
that the county shall provide funds
to cover half the cost of the im­
provement, the remainder to be fed­
eral aid.
Four formal applications totaling
$143,000 are already on file, exclusive
of numerous informal petitions in
which no amounts were fixed.
Aid of $105,000 is asked for the
Twin City-Duulth highway, $80,000
for the section through Pine county
and $25,000 for that in Chisago
county, the commissioners there hav­
ing voted to provide like amounts of
county funds.
Carver county is asking $15,000 of
aid for its section of the Yellow­
stone Trail. In connection with the
Jefferson highway, the single request
thus far is from Freeborn county
for $23,000, representing half the es­
timated cost of building the pro­
posed road from Albert Lea to the
north county line.
GASOLINE EXPLOSIONS
NUMEROUS IN SMALL TOWNS
Many garage fires from the smaller
towns and vilages of Minesota are
being reported, says Robert W. Har
gadine, state fire marshal.
Four men were injured, one pro­
bably fatally, as a result of careless
placing of a barel of gasoline in a
garage at Clinton last wek.
Persons conducting garages are
evidentally becoming careless and it
is important that the dangerous ele­
ment in gasoline should never be
bverloked for an instant. The absent
minded man who places a burning
cigar or cigarette stub near a barrel
of gasoline, or who takes a lighted
lamp into a garage is taking his life
in his hands, and is also criminally
negligent in relation to the destruc­
tion of property.
Never take chances. Be sure the
gasoline tank even though it is out­
side of the garage is perfectly tight,
and never, above all things, fail to
observe the common rule of caution.
LAUDS NORTH SHORE ROAD
Minnesota is better known as a
prairie than a mountain state, and
yet there is beautiful mountain
scenery in this state, according to J.
H. Mullen, deputy state highway en­
gineer in charge of road construc­
tion, who has just returned from a
visit to the northern part of the
state. He says the mountain scene
ery, which is not surpassed any­
where for wild beauty, is in Lake
and Cook counties. Mr. Mullen in­
spected the Duluth and Port Arthur
road, with which the Twin Cities-to
Duluth road connects, and found it
in good condition.
His Recommendation
A young man found it difficult to meet the
request for a recommendation when he sought
a new position in a strange city.
Finally he thought of his bank book and at
the next interview produced the same as a re­
commendation of his thrift and industry.
The novelty of the idea linked with the
continuity of deposits shown by the book, se­
cured the position for him without further in­
quiry.
Have you a recommendation of this kind
to back you, should you lose your present po­
sition? If not, get a pass book today and de­
posit your money with

FORMER CITIZEN DISPLAYS
PRESENCE OF MIND
J. A. Blackwell Rescues Young Lady
From Bad Burns and Possi­
bly From Death.
Quick work on the part of J. A.
Blackwell, of 2007 Minnesota avenue
undoubtedly saved the life of Miss
Engel of 2007 Minnesota avenue, a
daughter of J. C. Herman Engel, law­
yer, when the girl's clothing caught
on fire.
Blackwell was severly burned
on the hands and arms in making
the rescue, but his burns, though
painful, are not serious. Mother and
daughter are undet the care of phy­
sicians, who at a late hour last
night stated that both would re­
cover. The near-tragedy occured Sa­
turday.
Miss Engel had gone to the second
floor of her home to light a water
heater. Something went wrong, she
says, and there was an explosion.
Her clothing was ignited. She ran
downstairs screaming ,where her mo­
ther attempted to extinguish the
flames. Her efforts were futile and
she was burned herself.
Blackwell heard the girl's cries and
ran into the house. Sizing up the
situation at a glance he seized the
girl and ran with her in his arms
through a rear door. In the back
yard he rolled her in the sand, al­
though not before he as well as the
girl had been badly burned.
