EDGEFTELD, S. C., WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 8,191
NO. 40
JOHNSTON LETTER
Pleased With the County Fair.
Death of Mrs. Harrison Scott.
The Church Debt Paid.
A New Club.
The Edgefield Fair afforded three
very enjoyable days for many from
here. It is always a pleasure to go
to Edgefield, but to be there with so
many attrnctions, made it all the
more so. The exhibits were fine,
and all of the floats were beauti
ful, some being most original, and
no State Fair has ever exhibited
better. The fair not only afforded
sight seeing, but the meeting- up
with so many friends and relatives
made it doubly pleasant. Several
of the judges in the various depart
ments were from here, and this
courtesy was sincerely appreciated.
We hope for another fair next year,
and Johnston should be there with
more floats, and especially one from
her excellent school.
Mrs. Harrison Scott died at her
home here on Friday, after only
a few days illness. For many
years she has been in frail health,
but was able to be about with her
friends, and her sudden passing
away, was a shock to her many
friends, and every one is grieved
that this gentle, kindly woman is
no more.
She was a consecrated Christian
woman, and the example of her life
is one for emulation. She was a
loyal member of the M. E. Church;
she was true lo the cause of Christ,
true to her friends, and true to all
that was good.
Her presence in the immediate
home circle and with the neighbor
ing friends, was beautiful and sweet,
and her kindly touch was often felt
by needy ones, so her going to the
Heavenly Home, whil *:r? ;?

The funeral services were held on
Saturday morning being condm
by her paster, Rev. J. H. Th.ick?
Many beautiful flowers were ; 'aced
on her casket.
Miss Emma Bouknight has gone
to Dallas, Texas, as delegate from
the Mary Ann Buie Chapter, D. of
C., to attend the General U. D.
C. Convention.
Dr. J. D. Chapman, of Green
ville, fished in the home of Rev.
W. S. Brooke last week, and on
Wednesday evening made an excel
lent talk at the Baptist prayer meet
ing.
Mrs. John Howard Payne was
hostess for the "Young Matron's
Club" on Friday afternoon, and two
very happy hours were spent by
this congenial party of friends. The
members are all intimate friends,
and every meeting is of genuine
pleasure as they chat and exchange
ideas. Each one brought faucy
work, which occupied the Angers,
while chatting merrily.
During the latter part of the time,
the hostess invited all in the dining
room, and here the Hallowe'en idea
was well carried out. The room
was decorated in the? many symbols
of this weird night, and all the
lights had shadows of goblin faces.
Autumn leaves were used in the
decoiations, add the table was cov
ered with a lunch cloth decorated
in the symbols. The centerpiece
was a pumpkin filled with autumn
leaves, around which circled witch
es on brooms. A tempting salad
course, with coffee and whipped
- ci earn was served, and on each plate
was a tiny witch on a broom,
Mrs. Reynolds has been quite ill
at her home near town, but is now
thought to be some better.
Mr. and Mrs. Graham Payne, of
Greenwood, visited relatives htre
for the week end.
It is a great joy to the members
of the Baptist church that the debt
remaining, of their new church, has!
been paid in full. The members re
oponded willingly and most liberal
l ly, and there were some who were
not members that aided. One of
these, Mr. W. T. Walton, whose
membership is at Stevens' Creek
church, but who often attends here.
He gave ?500, and his generous gift
was sent, in an unknown way,
but the donor's name became known, i

Woman's Christian Temperance
Union.
The November meeting: of the
W. C. T. U. was held on Monday
afternoon at the home of Mrs.
Milton Jones, who entertained in
her accustomed kind and hospitable
way.
A very encouraging number wer>e
preseut, and the business consisted
of the decision to hold a Ruramaere
sale on Saturday week, and some
preparations were made for the ob
servance of World's Temperance
Sunday the coming: Sunday in each
of the schools of the town.
Little Mary Lillie Byrd recited a
humorous selection about 'keeping:
the corners of the mouth turned
down."
The programme called foran ex
perience meeting, and a number of
t?ie members responded, giving
some of the benefits they had de
rived from becoming white ribbon
adherents. The next meeting will
be with Mrs. Chalmers Hughes in
December.
The hostess, Mrs. Jones served a
delightful salad course with whio
ped cream and coffee.

(Written for Last Week.)
The union meeting at Clarks Hill
was well attended from Red Ooak
Grove. Messrs. Timmerman, Grif

reporting good meeting, but the
attendance was small, as is usually
the case, and ara sure the Saturday's
meetings are the most instructive,
at least, we find them so.

their task will grow more difficult

(Written for last week.)
The event toward which our com
munity has been looking forward
for some time has come and gone;
That is the Union meeting. Every
thing conspired to make this an ex-;
l-ceedingly enjoyable occasion. The")
weather and the seasons play a very|
important part in our enjoyment,,
and the success of our plans. In
these respects we weie fortunate,
for October, always beautiful, was
never more gracious and smiling
than on the opening day, and gracV
ed our meeting in her lovely dress,
of gieen, and crimson, and gold. ;
This earth is so beautiful sometimes^1
that it is good to be alive, just Wt
look at it. We sometimes wonder
if Heaven could . possibly be more
Lo our liking than this earth. Bufi;
I meant to tell you about ?the Un?
ion.
On Saturday, there was not
large crowd, but there were sot
choice spirits among those who
were there. All of the delegates
did not come, nor were all of th>
speakers present; nevertheless, th'?
program was carried out in full!
and all of the suggested topics v/ei
discussed in interesting and instruc
tive speeches. Those who spoke
were, Revs. J. T. Littlejohn, P..B?
Lanham, and J. A. Gaines, ai
Messrs. S. B. Mays and W/^jg
Gaines.
On Sunday, there was a lar?
crowd, many visitors being present
from a distance. On the chuac
ground, a great change which
taken place in Edgefield coafiB
within the last three years wras strik- !
ingly noticeable. That is, the great
'.-.-aq?fi in the number of autor
worm cv
respect. And our peo?..^ .
enjoying this mo?!? ci locomotion.
They can sympathize with the old
negro woman who was takihg her
first joyous ride on the railroad
train. Overcome by the rythmic
motion, she exclaimed, "Hum, hum,
I'm a ridin nm some. I'm jest hit
tin ?le groun' in de high places!" ?
But like the widow Bedott, I have
digressed again. I must get back
to the Union. The first service on
Sunday morning was of course that
of the Sunday School, which is con
ducted by Mr. W. J. Gaines. He
hailed this opportunity to bring in
something of fresh interest, and so
secured addresses from Mr. J. H.
Courtney, of Trenton, and Prof.
Mellichamp, Principal of the Red
Hill school. Mr. Courtney's ad
dress was on modern methods of il
lustrating the topic of the lesson.
He did this by using object illus
trations of thc- lesson for the day,
giving altogether an entertaining
and instinctive address.
Prof. Mellichamp spoke on the
value of faithfulness and regularity
in the discharge of dut^T, showing
that these qualities were of para
mount importance in the up-build
ing of a good Sunday School. His
remarks were thoughtful, practical,
and timely; and while disclaiming
any ability as a speaker he showed
himself no mean hand at the art. i
The sermon for the morning hour)
was by Re.v. J. T. Littlejohn, from
the text, "How can two walk to
gether except they be agreed." His
subject was "Progressiveness in
Mission Work" and he argued the
necessity of unity among the work-j
ers for the accomplishment of this.
The writer was sorry not to have
heard this excellent sermon.
The dinner hour was unusually
enjoyable, for the people who had
jolted there in cars were more than
ready for the bountiful feast which
was spread before them. This is
another respect in which old, or
rather new, Mt. Zion is not going
to be outdone. There is no church
anywhere which entertains more
lavishly or more cheerfully.
Assembling in the church after
dinner, the congregation listened at
tentively to a sermon by Rev. Jos.
A. Gaines, from the text, "Good
Stewards of the Manifold Grace of
God." "Stewardship" is the title
of this discourse, it being one of a

vein of its author, this sermon is
full of interesting and logical
thought.
The Union now came to a close,
with the announcement that the
next one would convene with Ebe
nezer church, at Trenton, on the 5th
Sunday in December.
Crop gathering has been pushed
forward with great rapidity in our
neighborhood during this fine fall
weather. Though the cotton crop
is not heavy, all seem cheerful and
hopeful on account of the fine price.
Our people are getting good prices,
too, for hogs, calves, butter, eggs,
and other produce.
Mr. W. A. Pardue has been do

grist mill, also, and is now turning
out corn meal of excellent quality.
Miss Lillias Weeks accompanied
her uncle, Dr. J. R. A. Whitlock,

This is a piece of good fortune upon
which she is to be congratulated.
Rev. Jos. A. Gaines and family

their new home.
Miss Mary Gaines is now teach

This, though, is good lrom a stand

Very Pleasant Entertainment in
Rehoboth Community.
The ladies of the Rehoboth W.
M. S. entertained in a most charm
ing manner last Saturday afternoon,
at the home of Mrs. P. P. Doolittle
in honor of Miss Julia Strom, the
popular bride-elect of Nov. 21.
i When in a round of merriment
and pleasant conversation, the little
honoree was unconsciously seated
beneath a parasol suspended from
the ceiling, Miss Lucile Cul breath,
in her bright and witty manner re
peated a few appropriate lines in
regard to Showers from above;
Showers of love," etc., gave the
parasol a tilt and the bride-elect
was covered with a heavy shower
of linen. Most of these beautiful
gifts wert the own handiwork of the
members of this society.
The hall, p.irlor and living room
were elaborately decorated in chrys
anthemums, roses and ferns. After
each had penned a good wish in the
Bride s book," we were invited in
to the dining room to partake of
dainty and delicious relreshments
This room was most artistically ar
ranged, the color scheme, white and
green, being carried oat in the min
utest detail.
A large, white bell being above
the beautifully appointed table,
while streamers of green and white,
and tall vases of carnations lent a
charm of loveliness to the scene.
The bride-elect received a tract from
the President of the society. Souv
enirs of dainty slippers, bearing in
gold letters the date of the ap
proaching marriage, were given to
e^ch guest.
Our little honoree wore a stylish
gown of nut brown charmeuse with
touches of pink, which harmonized
beautifully with her rosy complex
ion and wealth of rich browu hair.
Miss Strom has been a faithful
and efficient member ot our society,
and has served as treasurer for the
past four years. We are loath to
give her up, for in doing io, we feel
that we are losing ' '* : rr^M

COUNTY FAIR.
Large Attendance. Creditable
Exhibits. G^od Address by
Col, Watson. Three Beau
tiful Parades.
Owing* to tho financial depression
reeulting from the war in Europe
the members of the Edgefield Coun
ty Fair Association made no effort
to hold a fair in the falls of 1914
and 1915. But during the past
summer, after the return of prosper
ity was evidenced on every hand,
the managers decided to hold a fair
this fall, November 1, 2, 3 being:
selected for the dates. A3 soon as
Major R. S. Anderson returned
from Washington early in October,,
he threw himself unreservedly into
the enterprise and contributed very
largely to the success of the fair.
At first, he directed his attention
toward putting the buildings and
grounds in first-class condition, andi
as the date for the fair approached
and during the fair he looked after
many details, altogether contribut
ing a large measure of valuable ser
vice.
The weather last week was ideal
and thc occasion was in some res
pects ideal. Some of the depart
ments were particularly strong, not
ably the stock department. Some
of the hor3es, mules and colts
would have done credit to any fair
in the country. Many persons were
surprised that there was so much
fine stock in the county. This in
creased attention to stock raising is
one of the results of the fairs that
have been held in the past. Some
of the other departments were very
good, the weakest being the agri
cultural or field crops department.
Some of the few exhibits were very
tine, but there should have been ten
times the number. The appearance
of this department was a reflection
on the farmers of Edgefield county
-on those who took no interest and
made no exhibits.
TU- ...u:ur. ? ~ T%-.
a larger exhibit even.
After the parade Thursday, Col.
E. J. Watson, commissioner of ag
riculture, delivered an instructive
address about the coming of the boll
weevil and urged diversific'ation..
Col. Watson is always well received
by Edgefield audiences.
The fancy work department and
the household department were
good, but the ladies are entitled tc
the credit for this. The flowers in
the woman's building were also very
pretty and added much to the fair.
There were also some very credita
ble exhibits in the poultry building-;
but many persons who could have
entered fowls made no effort to ar
range an exhibit.
The ladies of the Civic League
and Cemetery Association were on
duty all three days, from the early
hours of the morning till late in the
afternoon, serving the great hungry
throng. They served the large
crowd wonderfully well, realizing;
for their work about $400, gross.
As heretofore, the uarades were
very attractive feature? of the fair.
Wednesday afternoon the parade of
decorated adult and child's rigs
was held, being formed as follows:
Misses Hortense Woodson and Ele
anor Miras, white rig and white
horse, l*t prize.
Misses Marie Holson and Eileen
Harling, daffodil rig with black
horse, 2nd prize.
Miss Hazell Dorn, a beautiful
wistaria rig with white horse.
Next came the children's rigs as
follows: Misses Gladys, Ann and
Mary Lawton, white rig, 1st prize.
Misses Mary and Martha Thur
mond, orange rig, 2nd prize.
Jack Feltham and Ethe Allen
