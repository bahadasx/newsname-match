In'only one instance has a chango
come infAmerica, we believe, as a re
sult of the war. There is a town in
Canada of about 15,000 inhabitants
that was settled and i u: It up to a large
extent by Germans and has many resi
dent of German descent. Since it was
named by the Germans it was very
naturally called Berlin. Well, a change
has come over the people of the town.'
Shortly after the great English war
lord, Lord Kitchener, was lost witti
all his start', through tne sinking of his
vessel by the Germans, a sentiment
grew up to change the name of Berlin,'
Ontario, to Kitchener, which was done
and the town is now known as Kitch
ener and has lost its German name for
ever.
There may be something in such a
sentiment that satisfies the Canadian,
but to the niinds of most people it will
prove a sickly sentiment thut is born
more ot foolishness and disregard for
business convenience than anything of
practical worth. It is silly to say the
least.

MAKING A TEST
Will Try Turning Under Crimcon Clover
and Corning Land Each Year
Sam Nelson was over from Genesis
Saturlay. Mr. Nelson is one of the
successful farmers ot that neighbor
hood and is always looking for a wa
to improve his land while producing
good crops.
Ht now has an experiment on hand?
that should prove very interesting to
farmers all over the county. He has a
small held of corn two and three
fourths acres that will produce at
least 70 bushels of corn to the acre
this year. He has the held in crimson
clover now and intends to broadcast
manure on at the rate of four to six
loads to the acre and put it in corn
again next year. He plans to keep up
that method of cutlivation for a period
! of years to determine if it is possible
to grow corn on the same land year
j after year and the land constantly im-
prove, by turning under crimson clover
i and a top dressing ot manure as stated, j
I Farmers in some sections claim to
have done that successfully and ne
wishes to learn if that can be done on
this plsteau soil. He realizes that such
a course will reduce the phosphorous in
the soil so that a few hundred pounds
of acid phosphate wilt be required
every few years.
The point Mr. Nelson has in mind is:
That if it is possible to continue to
improve this plateau soil with crimson
clover and a small amount of stable
.onure, while producing a good crop
if corn, the problem of successful
rming is practically solved.

HANGING NAMES OF TOWNS
as Been Done Frequently In Europe,
Only Once In America.
l he great European war has brought
any changes of many kinds. Early
in tne war Russia changed the name of
ne capitol of the country from St.
P tersburg to Petrograd. The change
as made as a thrust at the Germans.
Toe name Petrograd has become so
well known now that few people think
oi pplying the old name of St Peters
burg. Along the Austrian border towns
hve changed hands many times since
the war began and in many instances
the name ot the town would be
changed to conform to the ideas ot the
victor.
That IsJWhat This County Has Done
the Past Yoar In Fat Hogs.
We recently noticed an article in the
Nashville Banner which told ot farm
er near Columbia, Maury county, hav
ing sold $5,000 worth ot fat hegs this
year. Now ;hat was a large amount of
pork to come from one I u i i and is a
big performance for any farmer any
where.
Since Maury count ! recognized as
one of the very best counties in the
great Central Uaain 1 1 I eimessce, that
big. hog sain is not quite so much of a
state. It is not likely that farmer
made a clean profit of ver $1,000 on
that bunch of hog, if '.e did that.
It will be surprising to some people
to learn that a citizen of this county,
living on this great Cu uherland pla
teau, has surpassed tin I Maury county
man in point of actual profit made on
hogs.
Within a year R. K Dunbar has sold
$3,000 worth of fat hogs out ot the
woods. They did not cost him $1.00 a
head cash and there n not the slight
est doubt that the net profit to Mr.
Ounbar was fully $2,500 or even more.
Where does Maury county come in
with such profits as thatV
The article went on to state that the
Maury county man had r.old all the
hogs he owned, except a few he saved
tor home use, and that he had grown
the feed on his farm to fatten all of
them and had raised most of the hog
on his farm. Big stunt.
In the case' oi: Mr. Dunbar it cost
him practically nothing to raise or fat
ten those hoga that brought him $3,000
and he now has 200 hea.i or more in the
woods. With the splendid crop of
corns usually spoken of here as roast
he will market nevernl hundred dol
lara worth of hogs between now and
next May and they will cost him no
cash outlay worth mentioning.
While r.o other man in this county
has sold so many dollars worth ot hogs
as Mr. Ounbar, so far as we are aware,
tbere are very likely more than 100
farmers who took $100 to $500 in hogs
out of the woods last year and did it at
about the same small expense as Mr.
Ounbar.
Here are the names, addresses and
amounts that we know of personally
having been sold withn, tne past year,
and there are hundreds n-ore farmers
in this county who have sold lik
amounts or more: K. B. Hedgecoth,
Dorton, $600; T. T. SlettveU $150, C.
H. McCoy $300, W. M. Potter $240,
Genesis ; Hedgecoth Brothers $670, T,
