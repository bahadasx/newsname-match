this morning his re-election beyond

Mr. Tumulty, the president's sec

further, however, and asserted his
belief that the president Nill win

Mr. Tumulty Nvas in telephonic
communication with Chairman Vance
MeCormick at democratic headquar
ters in New York, shortly before lie
declared the presidents victory cer
tain. While all the oi'ice attaches
were greatly cheered by the re
ports from New York. Pres't Wilson
manifested no rreat concern.
Just as he had not appeared down
cast last ni-ht when his oüices were
shrouded in gloom, vo this morning
he did not seem in particular ela
tion at the improved prospects. At
no time did he show any signs of j
emotion, rising th.s morning just as j
calm and apparently unroncei n 1 i
as he was when he retired at midnight.
