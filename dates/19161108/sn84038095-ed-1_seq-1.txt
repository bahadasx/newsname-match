From reports received just before
EQing to press we are lnformed that
the election yesterday was a great vic
tory for the republican party. Late
reports by telephone to this office are
to the effect that it is a close race be
tween Wilson and Hughes, but Hughes
sleading with one electoral vote over
his opponent. It is conceded that
Hughes now has 252 electoral votes
while Wilson has 251.. The states of
Indiana, New Hampshire, New Mexi
co and Oregon are all considered as
doubtful. All that Hughes needs is
Indiana with its 15 electoral votes,
which will give him one more than nec
essary.
Hughes lead Wilson in New York
state with a plurality of 65,152, al
though he lost New York City, but the
upstate vote was strong enough to ov
ercome this setback. Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Maine, Massachusetts and.
in fact all of the Now England states
were carried by Hughes.
The Result in (the State.
Here in Iowa the usual republican
majority was rolled up, which is esti
mated this afternoon at better than
60,000. The one surprise of the cam
paign in this state was the great rec
ord made by W. L. Harding, his vote
being estimated at anywhere from 50,
000 to 100,000 more than E. T. Mere
dith. It was a walk away for the re
publican candidate notwithstanding
the mud slinging campaign carried on
against him by the Des Moines Regis
ter and its consorts. It is the general
opinion that the Des Moines Register
and the other papers fighting him car
ried their campaign to such an extent

that it won votes for him at every
hand. It is doubtful whether Mere
dith carried a single county in the
state although he did manage to car
ry his own ward in Des Moines by a
majority of 676 over Harding. It is
predicted that Iowa will give Hughes
one of the biggest majorities in the
history of the state.
It is reported that Congressman
Steele, dem., was re-elected while all
of the other members of congress will
be republican. Frank P. Woods car
ried the big Tenth district with, the
usual majority.
The early returns on supreme judge
while meager show that Deemer and
Evans will be returned to teh bench.
Nebraska Goes Dry
There is little doubt but what Ne
braska will be counted among the dry
states for the vote has been so heavy
that there is little doubt it can be over
come by the wets. Senator Hitchcock,
democratic senator of Nebraska, will
be returned to the senate.
The election in Crawford county was
quiet yesterday although every effort
was made to get out the full vote.. A
drizzling rain set in during the fore'
noon, which was enough to dampen
the spirits of the most optimistic poll
tician, but there was.very little specu
lation over the general results until
evening when the returns began com
ing in at the Commercial club room
and the Review office.
A few bets were placed during the
afternoon on Hughes and Wilson and
several bets on Meredith and Harding
were made before afternoon. There
was very little betting on the county
ticket, everyone believing that it
would be a close race.
Telegraph rettfrns were received at
the Commercial club, where the mem
bers and invited guests remained un
til the wee small hours of the morning
in hopes of getting an inkling as to
how the candidates for president were
running.
Returns from the precincts in Craw
ford county were received at the Re
view office, which kept open all night
long and was the only Denison news
paper which made any attempt to fur
nish the public with the county re
turns. The office was packed all night
long and as soon as reports were re
ceived they were telephones to the
Commercial club for the beenfit of
those there. The Review arranged
with a party at each precinct to send
in the returns just as soon as the vote
had been completed. These reports
commenced arriving at the Review of
fice at 9 o'clock and kept up until just
a few minutes before going to press
and we are glad to presetn the readers
of the paper with a complete table
showing how each county candidate
ran in the 27 precincts of the county.

was to be overcome, and the election
of Klinker, Kahler and Rosburg is grat
ifying. Moeller's defeat for tlie office
of clerk by only 29 votes is to be re

change this vote.
H. C. Rolls', the present republican
member of the board of supervisors, is
defeated as well as the remainder of
the ticket, and 'will retire with a rec

Messrs. Weed and White made good
showings in the face of heavy odds,

campaign continued for another week
