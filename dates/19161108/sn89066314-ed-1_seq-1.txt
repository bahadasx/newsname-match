LATEST STATE BULLETIN
ST. LOUIS, Mo , (3:30 a. m). 1,853
' precincts out of 3,459 in the state give
Wilson 215,706 Hughes 202,796. For
goiernor 1,775 precincts out of 3,459
in the state gUe Gardner 199,001
Lamm 200,440. For United States
Senator 1,753 precincts out of 3,459 in
the state gie Reed 204,911 Dickey
195,621.
Missouri will be In the Democratic
column, the returns received up to
2:30 o'clock this morning indicate.
The Republican majority In St. Louis,
with half the precincts counted, is ap
proximately 4,000. The Democratic
majority in the counjtcy. la expected
"
to ovcrcome'the St. Louis vote as well'
as any other Republican majority in
the other cities for the national and
state tickets.
It is the time-worn story of the
ote of the cities against the ote of
the outlying counties.
In the state 1,088 precincts out of
3,459 gave Wilson a lead of approxi
mately 12,000 votes, but many of the
larger counties were not accounted
for, and the vote is consequently not
a fair indication of what the country
districts will do. From all indications
the Democratic majority in these dis
tricts will be enough to offset any Re
publican lead in the Missouri cities.
St Louis gave Wilson 36,277 and
Hughes 40,982, out of 256 precincts,
with 244 more to be heard from.
Republic Says Gardner Is Elected.
That Gardner will be Missouri's
next g6vernor is asserted by the St.
Louis Republic. The vote in St Louis
is close, with Lamm as the favorite
candidate. Other Missouri cities re
main'silent Out of 1,088 precincts in
the state, Gardner received a vote of
109,125 and Lamm 107,883. In St
Louis 164 scattered precincts out of
500 gave Gardner 22,735 and Lamm
25,514.
From early indications the race
will not be decisive until all of the
3,459 precincts of the state are heard
from. Lamm may come up from be
hind, as he did in the primaries, or
the Gardner lead may be Increased.
Dickey, the Republican candidate
for United States Senator, will be
beaten, by James Reed, the present oc
cupant of the office. If early .returns
may be taken as an indication of what
the remainder of the state will do.
Democratic papers of the cities pre
dict a Reed victory by a large majori
ty. Out of the 3,459 precincts, a re
port from 1,070 gives Reed 118,086 and
Dickey 108,610. '
"tthole Ticket Probably Safe.
It is probable that the remainder of
the state Democratic ticket will be
elected All races are close. For
state auditor, Gordon is leading the
Republican candidate, Hackmann, by
a comfortable majority.
Unless the vote outside of Kansas
City and St Louis is large against li
quor, the prohibition amendment will
be defeated by a somewhat large ma
jority. In St. Louis the defeat of the
amendment Is estimated at 70,000.
The Kansas City ote had not been
heard from.
The land bank amendment has also
apparently met defeat The returns
on the First Amendment, for the pen
sioning of the blind, would also In
dicate that it had been defeated.

COUNTY SWATS G. 0. P.
Expected 3,000 Democratic
Lead Shows Up Gordon
Behind His Ticket.
-Boone County Democrats came
through yesterday with the predicted
3,000 majority. The national, state
and county tickets led by approxi
mately that number, according to re
turns received up to midnight from
thirty-two of the thirty-four precincts.
Wilson received 5,339 votes, against
2,179 for Hughes. Gardner beat Lamm
5,198 to 2,336, and Reed leads Dickey
6,320 to 2,240.
Incomplete returns from twenty
precincts show that John P. Gordon,
Democratic candidate for re-election
as state auditor, is the only Demo
cratic candidate who is running be
hind the ticket. His vote is 3,322 as
against 1,376 for George "R Hackmann.
Woodlandville and Prairie Grove
are the only precincts in the county
which have not sent in returns on
the presidential, gubernatorial and
senatorial candidates.
The Republican vote in Boone Coun
ty, as compared with the election of
1912, is increased. In the 1912 elec
tion Wilson received 4,185 votes, as
against 1,878, the combined count for
the Republican and Progressive can
didates. The strength of the Repub
lican and Democratic parties, as com
pared in 1916 and 1912, gives the Re
publicans a slight increase.

Columbia over the gubernatorial race.
Every return favorable to his father
could be read on his face. The re

BULLETIN
At 4 o'clock this morning Wilson1 was fast gaining- oh Hughes.
At 2:30 o'clock this morning Hughes was leading in the'Presidential.race
by a close vote. There were still several states In doubt, and the Democrats
declined to eoncede that the Republicans had won a victory.
The Kansas City, Star at that ktfir said that the national election was a
"complete tle-ap,", with, a slight; adTaitage to Hughes. The tabulated retaras '
showed that Hughes had WjXtctorlA votes, to 231 for Wilson. The late re
taras as the Xlssouiaa gees Jo presi this morning show that Wilson is "com
lag from behind," gaining in strength consistently.
Almost Certain Hughes.

The states still remaining particu

returns, are the following: Arizona, 3
votes; Michigan, 15; Oregon, 5; Wash
ington, 7; West Virginia, 8; Minneso
ta, 12; Wyoming, 3.
While California, Illinois, and Massachusetts are placed in the Hughes
column, the vote In each is close. According to early morning figures an of
ficial count may be necessary to settle the vote In several of the states. Wil
son had undoubtedly lost New York State, but Illinois, where early Hughes
pluralities seemed to put that state in the Republican column without ques
tion, was inclining toward Wilson as the count proceeded. Ohio, claimed by
the Republicans until after midnight, waa later coneeded Democratic, and
Massachusetts like Illinois, were fast losing their majorities for the Republi
can nominee.
With a lead that was considered as final, up to midnight, the Hnghes plu
ralities were being steadily ent down. Even with a slight lead, as-estimated
in the count at 3 o'clock, Hnghes must hold all the states apparently In the
Republican column and get an even break in the donbtfal ones to defeat Presl
jent Wilson.
Missouri Is apparently Democratic, although the race between Colonel
, Gardner, the Democratic nominee and Jndm Tinn. bin Hpmihlln nn.um.nt.
is close. Senator Seed has been returned to the" United States Senate, defeat
ing Walter S. Dickey of Kansas City by a safe majority, according to the late
returns. The vote in Kansas City is overwhelmingly Democratic. Colonel
Gardner, with Jackson County, St. Louis and about one-third of the state ac
counted for, is leading Jndge Lamm by a 7,000 plurality. This Includes thirty
seven counties ia the state.
