BIG CROWDS WATCH
RETURNS AS FLASHED
BY EAST OREGONIAN
A large crowd gathered at the East
Oregonian building last night to watch
the returns, and it was strictly sympa.
thetic with Wilson.
As the first reports came in with
a prediction of Hughes' election the
crowd acted as though it were at a
funeral but as the reports from ihe
western states began to show the
wonderful strength of Wilson, en
thusiasm grew apace. The faithful
ones braved the cold night until th.-
small hours of the morning as added
encouragement was received.
Hughes supporters confident of
victory early in the evening planned
a street ovation. Had it not been
that the members of the band wore
otherwise occupied there might have
been a grand hurrah for Hughes be
fore the chickens had hatched.
A group of men hung around the
East Oregonian office this morning
anxiously awaiting the final results
in some of the doubtful states which
might swing the election one wu or
the other. Election day was char
acterised by the absence of drunkenness.
