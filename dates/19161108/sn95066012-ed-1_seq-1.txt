GREAT DISASTER
AT
Trolley Car Went Through an Open
Draw
WAS FAULT OF NIOTORMAN
Apparently He Did Not See That the
Draw Was Open Until Few Feet
Away.
Boston, Nov. 8. Just because a
niotorman failed to see the danger
lights on the Summer street draw
bridge, 55 persons lost their lives
when a convertible surface car of the
HoFton Elevated Railway plunged
headlong through an open draw into
Fort Point channel at 5.30 last even
ing and seven others were rescued,
five from the cold waters of the har
bor.
It was the greatest eatastsophe that
has ever taken place in Uti c'ty.
Were It not for the escape of the con
ductor, George McKeon, who stated
positively that he had rung in 02 farts
just prior to the accident, the general
public would have been in utter Ignor
ance of the number of lives lost.
That the accident was dua t.- care
lessness on the part of the niotonoan
or the drawtenders was tiie concemis
of opinion as expressed last night, and
to add to the mystery of the Ifjiody,
the niotorman insisted that die lights
were hot displayed on the drawbridge
while three drawtenders are equally
positive that the lights were lit and
displayed on the bridge as required.
AN AMERICAN "HERO"
Marine Takes Advantages of Mistake
as to Sharpshooter's Medal.
Philadelphia, Nov. 2. George
Washington, a United States . marine
from Kentucky who does not bid fair
to eniulate the truth-telling record of
his illustrious namesake, marched
proudly down Broad st., recently with
a newly won sharpshooter's medal
pinned to the breast of his uniform.
Attracted by the medal which close
ly resembles the Maltose cross worn
by some European heroes, an old
gentleman asked him how he had won
It, and George delivered a picturesque
account of stirring deuls on shelltorn
battlefields, while one by one the
crowd gathered and listened in awe
struck silence.
"But I say old chap," interrupted a
stianger, "where did all this hap
pen?" "Oil, somewhere in France," re
turned George cheerfully and the
spellbinder's audience melted away.

FROM REPRESENTATIVE ROOT
Returns His Thanks to the Voters of
Bennington.
Editor of The Banner: Will you
let me use the columns of The Banner
to say, that the splendid support
given me at the polls yesterday is
greatly appreciated?
Due to the changed later date of
election and the uncertainty of the
weather, it is thought best to give
public thanks in this way, and in
place of a reception to make a modest
contribution to "The King's Daugh
ters," a most worthy non sectarian
charitable organization, so well
managed that all funds in its hands
will be used for the greatest good of
those in need of help at the beginning
of a winter sure to be hard on many
unfortunates.
With my thanks for this favor and
the loyal assistance of my friends I
am
Yours sincerely,
William A. Rout.

LEGISLATURE SURE REPUBLICAN
Fewer Democrat Elected Than Usual
. To the House and the Senate
Solidly Republican.
In what was the largest total vot-i
in her history, Vermont today gave to
Charles E. Hughes, republican pres
idential candidate, a plurality of over
20,000 votes over his democratic op
ponent, Woodrow Wilson. Republican
pluralities have always been larger In
every election since 1856, with the ex
ception of 1912, when a divided paity
brought down the normal republican
vote to virtually half Its size.
At the same hour Horace F. Graham
republican gubernatorial candidate,
had received 40.304 votes to 11,566
polled by William B. Mayo, democra
tic State standard bearer.
The same cities and towns gave
Carroll S. Page, republican candidile
for re-election to the United States
Senate, 41.927. against 13,393 for Cl
ear C. Miller, the democratic nomine-'.
The total Vote for Hughes and Wil
son, based on the returns at hand at
1.00 a. m., was 64,277 and It was ex
liected that the figures lrom the miss
ing towns would bring' this total above
the record vote of 64,778 cast In tho
famous Hayes-Tilden contest In 1876
Returns in th noectest for Stato
senator were missing from Addison,
Bennington and Washington, but the
remaining counties, which elect 33 of
the 30 members of the Senate did not
send a single democrat to the upper
house of the State government. The

New York. Nov. 8. The World
which this morning conceded the elec
tion of Hughes at 3 o'clock this after
noon says that President Wilson is
surely re-elected with not less than
267 votes In the electoral college
which is one more than the number
required to win.
New York, Nov. 8. The presi
dential election is in doubt and at
2.30 this afternoon the chances
seemed to favor the re-election of
President Wilson.
Wilson seems to be assured of 256
electoral votes while 266 are needed
to elect. Success i In either California
or Minnesota would elect him and
both states are closp with the vote
only half counted.
!n California with reports in from
3003 election precincts out of 5870 the
vote stood Hughes 218,841, Wilson
21V.8S5.
Ivess than one quarter of the re
turns from Minnesota were tabulated
at one o'clock and these gave Wilson
a margin of over 6000, but the returns
at hand included the vote of the larg
er cities where Wilson had most
strength. The Republicans claim that
the country districts will give the
state to Hughes but the country so
far reported does not hold up to Re
publican expectations.
The polls did not close in Minnesota
until 9.30 last night and in a large
part of the state the count did not
start until 10 o'clock this5 forenoon.
At Democratic headquarters it Is
claimed that Oregou, New Hampshire,
Washington and New Mexico are In
doubt, while Chairman Willcox of the
Republican committee still claims
Kansas and North Dakota. The vote
by states seems to be as follows:

Practically every newspaper In the
ON
TO DEPEND OH
United States this morning consid
cred the election of Hughes certain. .
When they found that New Yor!c,
Illinois, Michigan and Indiana had
gone for Hughes it seemed as though,
the unreported states could not
change the result, but the Rocky
mountain states , today showed up
mostly In the Wilson column and are
enough to change the result from the
earlier forecast. . .
The New York World, one cf the
strongest Wilson papers In the coun
try conceded the election to Hughes
this morning. The World's morning
ieport was as follows:
Charles Evans Hughes of New York
was yesterday elected president of
tho United States to succeed Wood
row Wilson. The vote cast appears to
be the largest In the history of the
country.
While the returns from some of the
Middle Western States have not been
finally reported and but fragmentary
returns received from the Pacific
Coast and Rocky Mountain States, It'
Is probable that Mr. Hughes will
have in the neighborhood of 300 votes
in the electoral college and that Mr.
Wilson will have between 200 and 231.
Mr. Hughes eeded 206 to win.
Four years ago Mr. Wilson carried
forty States, with a total of 435 elec
toral votes; Mr. Roosevelt six States,
with a total of 88 electoral votes, and
Mr. Taft two States, with a total of
6 electoral votes.
In the contest yesterday Mr. Hughes
carried at least twenty-four States
and Mr. Wilson probably less than
that number, but with fewer electoral
votes than those carried by Mr.
Hughes.
The states carried by Hughes, Vera
Connecticut, with 7 electoral votes;
Illinois, 29; Iowa, 13; Maine. 6; Mi
chigan, 15; Minnesota, 12; New Hamp
shire, 4; New Jersey, 16; New York,
45; Oregon. 5; Pennsylvania, 38;
Rhode Island, 5; Wisconsin, 13; Indi
ana, 15; Karisas, 10; Massachusetts,
18; North Dakota, 5; South Dakota,
5; Utah, 4; Vermont, 4; and Washing
ton,?. President Wilson carried the states
of Alabama, with , twelve electoral
votes; Arkansas, 9; Colorado, 45;
Florida, 6; Georgia, 14; Kentucky, 13;
Louisiana, 10; Maryland, 8; Mississip
pi. 10; Missouri 18; North Carolina,
12; Ohio, 24; Oklahoma, 10; South
Carolina, 9; Tennessee, 12; Texas, 20;
Virginia, 12; and West Virginia, 8.
The suites that have not fully re
ported, or which may 'be considered as
doubtlul are California, with thirteen
electoral votes; Delaware, 3; Idaho, 4;
Nebraska, 3; Nevada, 3; New Mexico,
3; Wyoming, 3 Arizona, 3.
The probabilities are that some, if
not all of these states which have not
been heard from, will cast their elec
toral votes for Hughes.
Mr. Hughes carried New York state
by a plurality of 100,000. The returns
from the Empire state gave an early
indication of the trend of popular
sentimmt throughout the country to
ward Mr. Hughes. The New York re
ports favorable to him were followed
later in the evening by partial returns
from Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey,
Wisconsin, Michigan and the New
England states that left little doubt of
his election.
The returns from Ohio, which was
considered one of the pivotal states,
at first indicated a substantial plurali
ty for Mr. Wilson, but the luter reports
tended to confirm the claims made by
the Republican managers that It might
be found to have cast Its twenty-four
electoral votes for Mr. Hughes before
the count was over.
The Hughes majorities reported
from Indiana and Illinois were accept
ed as giving an indication of what
might be expected from the states fur
ther west, when those fiures came In.
The difference In time and the fact
that some of tho polls In the Western
states close later than those in the
east rendered it Impossible to present
any definite figures at to the results In
California, Oregon. Washington and
most of the Rocky Mountain states in
this edition.
The only one of the latter to report
was Colorado, which had awarded Ha
