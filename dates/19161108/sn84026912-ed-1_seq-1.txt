21 Years Ago To-day
The X-Ray was discovered by Prof.
Roentgen.
Yearly the scientist gives mankind the
benefits and results of his laborious and pains
taking work. The man in the laboratory, how
ever, could not go on with his investigations and
experiments were it not for the fact that there
was money behind him. Helping humanity is
the noblest work of man, but money is one of
the necessary requisites.
Save, that you may be of future use to some

PITCHED HATTON AT EVERETT.
Steamer's Arrival from Seattle Hi lugs
Fusillade of Mullett*.
Everett, Wash.. Nov. 5.-At least
five men were killed and 4 0 wound
ed to-day in a tight at the Everett
city wharf between 250. members of
the Industrial Workers of the World,
who came here from Seattle on tho
steamer Verona, and a posse of 150
citizens headed by Sheriff Don Mc
Rae. Sheriff MeRne is among tho
seriosuly wounded.
The exact number of casualties
aboard the Verona is not known here.
Arter the shooting, in which about l,
000 shots were exchanged, the Vero
na turned around and started back
to Seattle. Many men were seen to
fall on the deck of the steamer and
others, panic stricken, jumped over
board. Some were taken from the
water, hut others disappeared, and it
is believed they were drowned.
The Verona reached Everett short
ly before 2 o'clock. The coming of
the party of invaders had been an
nounced in messages sent to liverett
from Seattle headquarters. A call to
industrial Workers of the World
members from all over the Slate had
been Issued earlier in the week and
the citizens of Everett at a meeting
held Saturday night planned to meet
the invaders and deny them privi
lege of landing.
When the Verona docked Sheriff
McRae, who was backed by a posse
of deputy sheriffs nnd citizens, in
formed the men on the boat that they
would not be permitted to land. One
of the men, evidently spokesman of
the party, began arguing with' the
sheriff and then made a speech.
Apparently as a signal, the man
dropped his hand and armed men on
the steamer opened lire on the posse.
The first man to fall was Sheriff Mc
Rae, seriously injured. One man was
killed Instantly and in a moment the
crowd on shore was panic stricken.
Deputy sheriffs, however, returned
the fire.
Men on the wharf and on the boat
were seen to fall and the Verona im
mediately started back toward Seat
tle.

Workers of the World and the au-:,
thorltles at Everett lins'boen on seve-1
ral months and was tho outgrowth,:?!
a strike of shlhgl? weavers here. Af
ter several minor outbreaks of vio
lence during tho strike, Sheriff Me
Rne organized the citizens' co mm It
Lee and expelled all members of the
Industrial Workers of the World
from Everett. On several occasions
small parties of men have attempted
to miter Everett, but have been turn
ed hack by tho sheriff. Last Monday
15 members of thc Industrial Work
ers came from Seattle by steamer,
but were mel at the wharf by tho cit
izens' posse, loaded into automobiles
and escorted to a | oint south of
town, where they wet liberated and
ordered lo leave,
Last week the Industrial Worker,
the official organ of tho Industrial
Workers of the World in Seattle, an
nounced that the forcible expulsion
of men from Everett must be aveng
ed and called for 2,000 volunteers to
I go to Everett, to establish the "right
of free speech."
I Wharf Surrounded.

slip the wharf was surrounded by
policemen, some, armed with shot
guns, and others with drawn pistols,
and :10 National Guardsmen, under

the guardsmen stood with fixed bayo
nets and carried ball cartridges.
As the steamer drew alongside the
pier Capt. D. F, (Willard shouted to
Capt. Wyman, of the Verona, .not to
land. Several members of the Indus
trial Workers of thc World aboaid
the'boat started to clamber over the
steamer's rall, but policemen halted
them at the point of revolvers. One
gang plank was lowered and under
supervision of the police the wound
ed were taken off the boat and wore
removed to the city hospital. The
four dead were taken to the morgue.
As the men marched down the
gang plank under cover of police shot
guns and pistols, they were searched
for firearms, but no weapons were
found. Several pistols were found
hidden in the cabin of the boat. All
the uninjured men were taken to the
city jail.

posse were: C. O. Curtis, former Na

j St. Louis, Mo., Nov. G.-Frank B.
Ruhr, (Republican candidate for Pres
idential Fleeter from the Tenth Mis
souri District, committed suicide to
day, thereby leaving a vacancy on
the Republican ballot. The Republi- |
cap State committee met and nomi-1
nated Henry Kersting to lill tho va
ia ney.
The death of Ruhr and tho olev
cnth-houi nomination of Kersting.it
is thought, may result in a division
of tho Republican vote for elector j
from tho Tenth District, and even if
Hughes tarries tho State it is possi
ble that tl Democrat would be elected '
tn that district. Should the. Stale go
Democratic, tho death of Ruhr will
have no effect in the electoral col

FLECTION STILL IN DOUllT.
Littest Dispatches Indicate Homo
erotic President by Close Voto.
Th<? Presidential election is dose!
Prom the very beginning of reports
that were Hushed over the wires this
fact was indicated, one report claim
ing a lead for the Republican ticket,
the next for the Democratic. At il
o'clock hiBt night reports indicated
thai Hughes would have a majority
of some 20 votes in the electoral col
lege. Indications early this morning
seemed to veer toward a slight in
crease of the Hughes lead.
Then came a reversal of conditions,
later returns from the Western
States losing votes for the Republi
can ticket and adding to the Demo
cratic side.
As wo go to press the latest to
come to us is the report that the
count will show that Wilson will
have 'I to 6 votes majority in the
electoral college. This is too close
for comfort; slight changes could
bring tills down rapidly. If these lat
est dispatches are authentic, however,
the probability is that Wilson's vote
Will be increased, probably adding a
few electoral votes to his credit.
lt ls reported that the Republicans
will have a majority In the House of
Representatives, but the D?mocrates
may hold control of the Senate,
though by a reduced majority.
Nothing lias come lo indicate to
what extent the Republican ticket
was voted In thlB State, nor as to tho
result of the bolters' ticket with Mr.
Dienso's name 'as a candidate for
Governor, lt had no show here, and
lt is presumed that Oconee. a very
conservative county, gives a fair
guide to tho general trend of politi
cal opinion in the State.
Say It's Democratic Victory.
At the last moment dispatches are
going over the wires stating that the
figures showing 4 to G Democratic
majority in electoral vote are practi
cally authentic and 111 not be
changed.
HAS RODD WEEVIL ARRIVED ?

A special dispatch to the Charles
ton News and Courier, dated Novem
ber G th, b'ays:
"From best information obtaina
ble here it seems that Saluda county
has been honored hy th?? Hist visit of
the boll weevil in this State. An in
sect, believed to be U boll weevil, was
on oxhibilioil here Saturday and
caused a great amount of discussion
and comment among (bose who saw
or heard ol lt. lt was brought lo
town in a bottle by Arthur Rushton,
of the Coleman's Cross Roads sec
tion, a few miles from town. Mr.
Rushton say.- that he found it In his
cotton and that he has plenty more
like them. Ile further slates that the
boll weevil, or whatever the bug may
bo. did eon shh ruble damage to his
cotton crop this year.
"From the statements of Mr. Rush
ton the bug works like the weevil and
is very destructive to cotton. Many
who have seen boll weevils examined
the insect here to-day and pronounc
ed it a genuine boll weevil. Some
specimens recently brought here from
Alabama were compared with this
Saluda county bug and they could not
be told apart. Although they differ
ed some In color, they were about the
same size and shape, and it was no
ticed that even tho weevils which all
came from Alabama differed among
themselves in shades of color.
"Thc insect brought here was
shown to R. B. Hare, of the United
States Department of Agriculture,
and he pronounced it as his belief
that it was a genuine boll weevil, al
though he stated that he was not au
authority."

Berlin, Nov. 0.-"Polish provinces
occupied by troops of tho Central
powers," says thc Overseas News
Agency, "were thc scone to-day of a
great and momentous historic event.
Germany and Austria-Hungary by

Lublin, the Kingdom of Poland, and
re-estab'ished the right of the Polish
nation to control its own destines; to
live an independent national life and
to govern itself by chosen representa

"A few days ago a Polish delega

reigned in Poland from 1386 to 1572,
and glorious soldiers like the great
Sobleskl, (John III, King of Poland
