THE
TWENTY-SEVENTH YEAB
At An Early Hour
SWEPT THE EAST AND MIDDLE WEST
DEMDGHATIC HOPE LAY IN COAST
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
NEW YORK, Nov. 7. Just before
midnight the. election returns, still in
complete in many states, indicated the
election of Hughes and Fairbanks, but
the figures were very close and the
democratic managers steadfastly re
fused to concede a republican victory.
Although the metropolitan news
papers which have supported President
"Wilson conceded his defeat, the demo
cratic managers insisted that complete
returns from the west would reverse
the figures which steadily seemed to be
piling up the Hughes column.
"Remember 18ff2," was the prediction
of the democratic publicity bureau,
which pointed out that in that memor
able contest, the next day's revised re
turns placed Grover Cleveland in the
AVhite House.
"Soon after midnight the republican
rational committee in an official state
ment claimed California, Connecticut,
Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mich
igan, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
New York, North Dakota, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Da
kota, Vermont, Washington, West Vir
ginia and Wisconsin.
That made a total of 284 electoral
votes, 18 more than the necessary 266
for an election.
This was the first official indication
from the republicans that the result
would be so close. The republican
managers realized that a sudden switch
in the states incomplete or unheard
from might increase the Wilson figures
but were sure the later figures would
add to the states they were claiming.
At 11:30 o'clock tonight Vance C. ifc
Cormick, chairman of the democratic
national committee, ".ve out the fol
lowing statement:
"We do not concede Hughes' election
by any means. President Wilson can
still win with the votes of the states
from which we have heard nothing.
"We have just heard from our west
ern headquarters that; they do not con
cede Illinois. All of the western states
are yet to be heard from and Indica
tions are that they are all for Wilson.
"We have given up New York and
the indications are that we have lost
New Jersey. The . indications are we
still hold Massachusetts and Kansas.
Delaware and Maryland appear to be
safe.
''We have received nothing from
Shadow Lawn to indicate that they
have given up the fight."
Mr. McCormick added that he would
not give out any definite statement be
fore tomorrow morning unless the later
reports indicate a decided change in
the present situation.
McCormick't Midnight Hunch
NEW YORK, Nov. 7. Vance Mc
Cormick, chairman of the democratic
national committee, at midnight
claimed the election of President Wil
son by 277 votes in the electoral college.
"Our. reports received up to mid
night," said Chairman McCormick,
"snowed that the president had re
ceived certainl" 2'6 electoral votfcu, not
Including Massachusetts and Connecti
cut or California and other far western
states yet to be heard from."
The New York Landslide
NEW YORK Nov. 7. The state of
New York has been carried for Hughes
by a plurality of more than 100.000. The
indications are that he also has car
ried Illinois and Indiana by a like plur
ality. The returns from Ohio are Insuffi
cient to determine the result in that
state.
All of the New England states and
New Jersey as well as Wisconsin and
Michigan have been removed from the
list of doubtful states.
Unless there is a landslide for Pres
ident Wilson on the Pacific slope, the
election of Hu"hes seems certain.
Althoue-h President Wilson's secre
tary at the summer White House, and
Chairman Vance C. McCormick of the
democratic national . committee, made
statements that the complete returns
would show the re-election of President
Wilson, the trend on the faoe of the
returns was toward Hughes and early
in the evening some of the New York
newspapers which have supported Wil
son conceded his defeat, although they
made no statement in figures. Early in
the evening a great majority for
Hughes in New York was evident and
the state was conceded by the dem
ocrats. Soon afterward democratic sup
porters conceded the loss of all New
England to the Hughes column, and the
increasing returns of the middle west.
although far from complete showed the
Hughes figures growing fast.
Early estimates of the Highes elec
toral vote without Ohio placed it at 277,
eleven more than necessary for a ma
jority In the electoral college. The
Hughes malorities reported from Indi
ana and Illinois were regarded by the
republican leaders as an indication of
what might be expected from the states
farther west when the figures began
coming in.- The difference in time and
the fact that polls in some of the west
ern states closed later than in the east
made figures early in the evening im
possible. Nothing definite as to the comDlex
lon of the next congress was available
early in the night. The democratic ma
jority In the house had been decreased
by one. It was conceded that the ma
jority in the senate had been decreased
by two one by the republican victory
in Maine last September and the other
by the election of William Calder from
Arizona State

THE EFFECT ON CONGRESS
NEW YORK, Nov. 7 Congres
sional election returns were insuffi
cient at 11 o'clock tonight to indi
cate what would be the complexion
of congress. At that hour, how
ever, the republicans had gained
two senators, one in New York and
one in Maine, elected last Seotem
ber, and the indications were that
I they would gain at least three
more, two in Indiana and one in
New Jersev. To gain control of
the senate the republicans must
win nine seats beside holding1 their
own.
Although republican party lead
ers predicted tonight that the demo
ocratic majority of 23 in the pres
ent house would be wiped out, the
early returns showed a net gain of
one for the republicans through the
defeat of McGillicuddy in Maine
last September. They gained two
in New York, but this was offset by
a democratic gain of one in North
Carolina and one in Pennsylvania.

INDIANAPOLIS. Nov. 7. At ' 10:3n
o'clock, the outcome of the election in
Indiana was still In doubt, but Hughes
for president and Goodrich, (Rep.), for
governor, were leading by small mar
gins. The two republican candidates
for United States senator also were
leading.
Marion county, in which Indianapolis
is located, went republican by a good
margin.
Leaders at both the republican and
democratic state headquarters were
claiming victory in the state for their
respective parties.
The returns on congressmen indi
cated the republicans would increase
their membership. In the 5th district,
socialists assert, Eugene V. Debs, can
didate fo- Socialist party in 1912 for
the presidency, has been elected to
congress. The democrats also contend
that Moss has been re-elected.
Indications are that the vote was the
largest ever cast 4n the state.
Remember 1892
NEW YORK, Nov. 7. Robert W.
Woolley, director of publicity of the
democratic national committee, an
nounced at 7:15 o'clock that the com
mittee claimed 306 electoral votes for
Wilson, based on the reports of state
and county chairmen from the New
England, middle west, and northwest
ern states.
Mr. Woolley said: "Remember 1892.
In that year all the election night fig
ures had to be revised" the next day and
the reputed republican victory landed
Grover Cleveland in the White House."
A Democratic Claim
NEW YORK, Nov. 7. A statement
issued by the democratic national com
mittee at 1:30 a. m. claiming that with
the loss of the following states, which
it was not believed that Hughes had
carried, President Wilson was still re
elected by a majority of two votes in
the electoral college: California, Indi
ana, North Dakota, South Dakota, West
Virginia and Wisconsin. The commit
tee claimed that even if these states
were lost it will give president Wilson
a vote of 268 in the electoral college.

The Judgment of the People
Republican A. P. Leased Wire'j
NEW YORK, Nov. 7. Charles E.
Hughes and his followers received
election returns here tonight at the
uptown hotel which has been the re- j
publican nominee's headquarters since
his nomination. j
When the early returns began to
come in Mr. Hughes was asleep. He
slept until 6:30 o'clock. Meantime
the telegranh instruments In an ad
joining "room had been clicking for
two hours and a sheaf of telegrams
showing the trend in New York, were
awaiting Mr. Hughes. The first paper
handed to him told of an announce
ment bv a New York newspaper that
he had carried New York state by
150.000 plurality. Mr. Hughes smiled.
Mrs. . Hughes and their three
daughters, the Misses, Catherine,
Elizabeth and Helen, scanned the
returns over Mr. Hughes' shoulder.
Presently Charles E. Hughes, Jr., and
his wife, and Dr. Colin a Carter.
Mrs. Hughes brother, joined the
group. Dinner was ordered, the first
in months at which the entire family
had been present.
Returns soon came in faster and
dinner was negiected for a time to
read them. A huge electrif sign
several blocks away fleshing the re
turns from New York divided the
family's attention with the telegraphic
reports. Thev lingered at dinner un
til late and the groun in the co-rido-onposite
the telegraph room heard
frequent outbursts o' laughter.
At 9 o'clock Mrs. -Hughes concratu
Ifted her husband on his elee'lon.
She told him then that he had been
elected. Mr. Hughes' daughters also
congratulated him.
Mr. Hughes gave out no statement.
A crowd of thousands wlh b-ass

Mr. Hughes was staying and at 11

LONG BRANCH, N. J., In the face of
returns at 10 o'clock indicating the
election of Charles E. Hughes, Presi-
dent Wilson and his official family
here late tonight insisted that news
from western states would be awaited
before any concessions were made. The
president surrounded by members of
his immediate family, read the returns
in his study at Shadow Lawn. He heard
only the more important bulletins by
telephone from Secretary Tumulty,
who received the detailed reports by
telegraph at the executive offices in
Asbury Park.
As continued discouraging news
came to the executive offices, disap
pointment generally was exhibited. He
filled the time between receiving re
turns by talking with Mrs. Wilson, Miss
Margaret Wilson and other relatives.
Mr. Wilson displayed keen" interest in
the returns indicating the probable
complexion of the next house and sen
ate. Discouraging as well as hopeful
news was sent to him by Secretary
Tumulty. No effort was made to con
ceal the fact that the outlook was not
bright. Returns from western states,
however, were awaited eagerly.
Out In the seclusion of Shadow Lawn
the president was amid quiet, but the
executive offices were surrounded by
an excited crowd. Next door a news
paper flashed the bulletins. Pictures
of the president and Mr. Hughes were
received with applause.
As late reports came to the executive
offices by telephone and telegraph and
from local democratic leaders in vari
ous states, the hopes of the president
and those about him began to rise.
Stronger claims were made that on the
final count Mr. Wilson would win.
Apparently the president was the
most cheerful person here. Those who
talked with him said he showed no
Impatience. He began receiving re
turns shortly after six o'clock, and
after eating dinner with members of
his family, began getting them again.
He waited until he was called to the
I telephone to receive news.
It was declared that the outcome of
the election will make no immediate
change In the president's plans. He
will go ahead planning for legislation
he desires at the December session of
congress. He will remain here until
Thursday night when he goes to Will
iamstown. Mass., to attend the christ
ening of the child of his daughter, Mrs.
Francis R Sayre. He expects to re
turn to Washington Sunday night.
President Wilson went to bed at
12:30 o'clock. He left word, however,
that if really definite returns were re
ceived during the night he should be
awakened.
FIGHT IN A DUEL
Republican A. P. Leased Wire "
ROME, Nov. 7. (Via Paris. Nov. 7.)
An Austrian submarine and an Italian
destroyer were sunk in a duel on the
mgnt or October 16 according to the
admiralty today. The submarine had
attacked a' transport which escaped.
The text of the statement follows:
Austrian submersible on the night of
Oct. 16-17 torpedoed one of our trans
ports conveying troops but was dis
covered and attacked by a convoying
destroyer. The submarine and the de
stroyer sank, while the transport
reached its destination safely. The ma
jority of the crew of the destroyer
were saved and two officers and eleven
men of the crew of the submarine were
made prisoner. -
"On the night of Nov. 1, our destroy
ers after crossing boldly and success
fully a mine zone and surmounting by
their daring solid obstacles defending
the Fasana-Pola canal managed to en
ter the customary anchorage of part of
tne Austrian fleet. Two torpedoes were
fired against one large ship and weie
observed to catch in the vessel's tor
pedo net.
"For two hours our destroyers re-
connoitered within a few hundred yards
of the forts and strong citadel of Pola
and only withdrew when they had ac
complished difficult and most delicate
missions. Numerous powerful search
lights beat the sky and sea and batter
ies opened random and futile fire.
"On the flight of Nov. 3, several of
our destroyers sank a large Austrian
steamer anchored at Durazzo under the
shelter of defenses and a mine zone.
Enemy destroyers came out and were
attacked by our ships which forced
their retreat. Our destroyers then re
turned safely to their base. On .Nov. 5

military works are there. One of our
armorea trains rusnea up, engagea ana
drove off the enemy. Two destroyers
were hit, one was seen with a heavy
list, being assisted by others. The en
emy fire was ineffective, one railroad
man being slightly wounded and small
damage done to private property.

REPUBLICAN
Maddoek Claims Cambbell
At midnight, in the face of weirdly scattered returns
from this fjiid all the other big counties Thomas Maddoek,
republican sta'te chairman made the following statement:
"Tom Campbell will be elected. Mesa alone will give
him a bigger majority than Hunt will receive in the entire
county of, Cochise. Campbell has beaten Hunt 3 to 1 in
many Maricopa county precincts.
' ' I claim the state for Campbell by 2,500. I will not be
surprised if we carry Maricopa county by 4,000.
"Judge Kibbey is running strong in the south of the
state and if the more complete returns from Maricopa give
him the figures he should reasonablv expect in- his home
county, he will be elected. I concede Ashurst's strength,
but retain hopes of seeing Kibbey elected."

was for the republican candidate.
NoSules was givin? Campbell a small
lead shortlv after midnight. In
Tucson orecinct No. 2. 680 votes gave
Campbell a majority of 121.
Sixty-nine votes in Kingman (Mo
have county, a stronghold of Hunt's)
gave Hunt and Campbell each- 33
votes and three to the socialist can
didate, Robertson. Ashurst received
45 to Kibbey's 22 in the same poll
Some figures on Hayden precincts
1 and 2 show Hughes and Wilson
running absolutely even, with Hunt
leading Campbell. Baughn was show
ing a two to one lead over Ross
in No. 1 and Ross had the Pinal judge
bested bv two on one- in the second

tial "results: Hunt 142, Campbell 50,
Ross 70. Baughn 6?,, Ashurst 140,
Kibbev 42. Hughes 41 Wilson 13S.
Indications that Tom Campbell
would carry Maricopa county by 2500
or more lent a hopeful tone to the early
returns. Which were extremely patchy.
Phoenix precincts, dribbling in between
9 and 11 o'clock, gave incomplete re
sults that encouraged the Campbell
rupporters to believe he would carry
the county by at least 2500, and by 10
o'clock, George J. Stoneman, chairman
of the democratic state central com
mittee, conceded the county to the re
publican standard bearer by a thou
sand. He could not be reached later,
so it was impossible to secure a sub
sequent statement. Republican cam
paign manaeers made absolutely no
claims for either Campbell or Kibbey
up to a late hour last night.
Working against severe odds, news
gatherers for The Republican and
agencies in its employ, secured but
scattered returns from the local pre
cincts. In Phoenix, where the vote
was heaviest, some of the election
boards calmly proceeded to count the
votes on the measures, leaving the
public panting for news of the fate

BOSTON, No. 7.-'Nearly fifty peo
ple lost their lives when a surface trol
ley car of the Boston Elevated Rail
way company plunged through an open
draw at the Summer street bridge
today.
The car is believed to have carried
sixty people. The cause of the acci
dent has not been determined.
Forty-four bodies had been recov
ered at a late hour. All the bodies re
covered were those of men.
Mayor James H. Curley ordered an
investigation.
The passenger car plunged through
an open drawbridge into Fort Point
channel, just outside the South sta

rescued from the water by fireboats.
One man, Thomas J. Gannon died af

but the recovery of other bodies was
delayed, as it was believed they were
pinned in the car which rested on the
bottom of the channel, thirty-five feet
deep. Gerald Walsh, motorman of the
car, jumped before it went over the
edge of the draw.

was secured, however, to prove that
Campbell would carry the city by a
comfortable margin. An early count of
fifteen Maricopa county precincts gave
Campbell 1241 and Hunt 814. Hughes
on this same count, surprised every
body by getting 718 to Wilson's 814.
Kibbey ran rather poorly as com
pared with Campbell here, but It is
explained by the fact that fewer pre
cincts returned a count on the sena
torial race. Interest seemed to center
in the contests for the presidency and
the governorship, and few of the state
and ennntv rarps u'oro fnHnxtmA nt K
lne counters.
Voting began early and was fairly
brisk, although the streets did not ex
hibit the speeding autos and the busy
people they did four years ai. A
heavy vote -was cast in some of the
city precincts, while others proved
light. It was estimated early last even
ing that the vote would exceed that of
1912 in percentage of registration, but
no figures were given.
In Phoenix No. 2, where there was a
heavy registration, many women voted
early, and by noon, about 65 per cent
of tne vote had b'pen 'phoenlx
No. 1 cast but 250 votes out of its 421
registration. No. 16 was a banner pre
cinci, witn 4b4 out of 5i0 voting.
The election of two years ago and
the recent primary furnished more
downtown excitement than did yester-jback and forth from the rallying point
day's election. The street crowds were; with militarv-like system. Practically
much smaller, and the speeding autos
were either less in number or kicked
up a heap less dust. WorKesg for the
various parties and candidates were ex
tremely busy, and in many cases did
very efficient work. The election was
handled very completely and carefully
by the several republican organizations.
which claimed to have gotten out a
large per cent of the party's vote.
Democratic candidates busied them-!
selves, and swelled the already large
number of workers'for that party. The
outside work of the . democrats indi
cated they were much- better organized
than were the republicans, and they
did not care who knew it.
Women Do Splendid Work
The work of the republican women at
the polls yesterday was one of the fin
est examples of political team play
ever witnessed. They were on the job
at six in the morning and stayed until
the last vote was in the ballot boxes.
In some precincts, practically a hun
dred per cent of the republican vote
was cast. Sick women were induced
to get out of bed and go to the polls to
vote. One worker, in order to secure a
couple of votes from women, engaged
in family ironed their laundry for them
while they went to the polls.
The enthusiasm throughout the coun
ty for Campbell and Kibbey was in
tense. The cooperation of numbers of
people who usually do not actively par-
ticipate in political work was shown by
the large numbers of automobiles do
nated as well as by the scores of vol
unteer workers.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 7. Precedents
established in the case of the Ameri
can ship, Fiye, wheat laden and bouni
for England, sunk in mid-Atlantic by
the German auxiliary cruiser Prin
Eitel Friederich in 1915, are expected
to lead the German government vol
untarily to offer to pay for the steam
er Lanao, sunk by a German submarine
off the coast of Portugal, October 28,
if it is established that the vessel was
sailing legally under the American
flag and registry.
The state department is makinef
every effort to develop the facts. It
appears certain, that due warning was
given and proper care taken to safe
guard the lives of all on board. Tho
question to be cleared up is whether
the Lanao was an American ship. It
is known that negotiations for he
sale ' by the American owners to a
Ni rweigian shipowner had been in
progress belore the vessel started on
the voyage, but it is not clear whether
these had been concluded and the
registery actually changed at the time,
of the attack or whether the change
of ownership and registry were con
ditional npen the delivery of the ship
at a Norwegian port.
Regarding the right of the German
submarine commander to destroy the
cargo of contraband rice destined to
a French or enemy port there is no
disposition to raise any question. But
in the Frye case the German govern
ment admitted that under article XIII
of the treaty of 1799 the ship itself
should have been allowed to proceed
after the removal' of the contraband
cargo.
i earlv morning and the autos moved
all- the machines used by the Alliance
forces were donated, as well as the ser
vices of nearly all the workers.
The election naturally showed up
some odd features. For instance, one
person, presumably a woman, carefully
voted for strict prohibition, and against
local option, and left the rest of her
ballot an uncompromising blank. Ap
parently no candidate was good enough
to secure her support.
There was a surprising number of
straight tickets in the Phoenix precincts.-
In No. 2 there were 6(!6 regis
tered. 541 voting. . There were 107
straight republican and the same num
ber of straight democratic tickets.
In No. 9 there were 82 straight re
publican and 68 straight democratic
ballots.
No. 16 had 464 registered and it is
said that Campbell carried that precinct
big. Many in this precinct voted both
yes and no on the amendments. There
were 74 straight republican and 44
straight democratic votes.
Phoenix No. 4 had a lot of tickets on
which none of the non-partisan candi
dates received a vote. The registration
was 501 and the vote 351, which is
light as compared with many other
precincts.
Phoenix No. 3 had 281 registered and
219 voting.

Polls workers in Phoenix took time
off during the dinner hour last evening

comes from the cutting of both Stapley
and Davis by the warring democratic
factions."
