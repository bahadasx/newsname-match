EW YORK, Nov. S. The result of
the election still was officially
in doubt today with a decided
drift toward the reelection of president

by a large plurality.
No figures are obtainable on the
balance of the state ticket, but it is
assumed that the Democrats generally
are in the lead.
The weather was fine and a maxi
mum vote came out Locally, the elec-tio-i
was remarkable for the number
of straight Republican ballots cast
and for the scratching of the Demo
crats. Ashurst's and Hayden's election was
conceded by Republican central com

nominee.
Chan men of both national commit

the electoral college for their candi

made good the claims of neither. They

From the doubtful states the returns

up in tne east oy tne returns coming in
from the west. When the Republican
landslide in New York became known
and was quickly followed by the heavy
Republican victories In New England,
there was a veritable stampede last
night to announce the election of Mr.
Hughes and the defeat of president
Wilson.
Hundreds of thousands waiting In
the streets saw the signal lights flash
the defeat or the president; New York
newspapers, which have been promi
nent ls their support of him, conceded
the president's defeat even before some

In the early returns the trend was
toward the Democratic ticket. How
ever, there was disquieting news for the
Democrats rrom Portales, Roswell and
Tucumcarl. which indicated that the
eastern counties have not given as big
a majority for Wilson as had been ex
pected. Socorro county probably gives Bur
som 800 majority, but he falls below
the estimate in Bernalillo, San Miguel
and Santa Fe counties.
With a heavily scratched vote, it was

California, Delaware, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon,

Are Still in Doubt Wilson's Chances Are
Apparently Brightening.
NEW YORK. Nov. 8. Woodrow Wflson is apparently elected on th
face of the returns so far tabulated, though the Republicans decline tc
concede it.
Results at 5 p. m. indicated that Wilson would receive at least 27 :
electoral votes, while only 266 are necessary to elect The Democrats arr
strongly claiming West Virginia, which would give Wilson 279. It is ever
possible that more of the states generally credited to Hughes as either safe or
aouDtiui may swing into the Wilson column on the final count.
