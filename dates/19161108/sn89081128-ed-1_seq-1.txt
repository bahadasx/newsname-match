GRAND JURY ACCUSED OF
BURGLARY
BROTHER DISCHARGED FATE
OF BURNES IS POSTPONED
A WEEK
James Murphy, alias Art. Henderson,
alias James Donahue, accused of being
one of the men who robbed Erickson &
Kirso's store at Comfrey on the night
of October 13, last was held to the
grand jury, by Justice N. Henningsen,
Thursday morning, following a hearing
which was held Wednesday afternoon,
bail being fixed at $2,500. The charge
against Henderson, alias George Kruse,
was dismissed, the evidence not being
sufficient to hold him, in the opinion
of the court. The case of James Burnes,
also charged with being implicated in the
robbery, was taken under advisement
until next Thursday. Following the
hearing Wednesday afternoon which
lasted until after 6 o'clock, a recess was
taken until 9 o'clock the next morning,
when Justice Henningsen rendered his
decision.
Hi*S&5
St. Paul Attorney Appears
Several witnesses were examined by
the prosecution, conducted by County
Attorney Adolph Frederickson. T.
J. Newman, a St. Paul attorney,
appeared for the defendants.
The first of the state's witnesses ex
amined was Edward J. Kisro, of the
firm of Erickson & Kirso, whose store
at Comfrey, was robbed on the night
of October 13. He described the nature
of the robbery and how the thieves had
entered the store sometime between
10:40 at night and the opening of the
store on the following morning. He
said the store was locked at the close of
â€¢"-/business at 8 o'clock the evening of the
13th and that later in the evening he
had visited the store on an errand, and
when he left, both doors, at the front
and rear, were securely locked.and at
that time the stock was all in its proper
place. In the morning when the place
was opened, empty shoe boxes and other
articles were scattered about the floor.
Examination showed that the lock had
been forced open evidently by some
sharp instrument, which had cut a notice
able slit in the door ..casing. Mr. Kisro
positively identified a number of neck
ties and four pairs of shoes recovered
from one of the prisoners when arrested
in St. Paul.
Night Policeman John Girg, of this
city, testified that he saw a Ford car
pass through New Ulm, going towards
Mankato, shortly before 4 o'clock on
the morning of October 14.
Albert Schmelz, a telegraph operator
at the Northwestern depot at Sleepy
Eye told the court that he saw the
prisoner who gives his name as James
Murphy in the depot at Sleepy Eye about
5 o'clock on the afternoon of October 13,
when he appeared at the ticket window
and sent a telegram to his wife at Sioux
City, and again about 6:30 on the same
day when he sent another telegram.
Detectives Tell Of Arrests
Paul Gottfried, a member of the St.
Paul City detective force told how he
and Detective Carr, of the same force,
arrested the three prisoners. Burnes
and Murphy were arrested in Murphy's
room at the Spalding hotel in St. Paul.
With them were their wives. Hender
son, who is only 19 years old, was in
another room at the same hotel, with his
alleged wife. The detective told of
finding the property recovered in Mur
phy's room. Burnes was stopping at the
Windsor hotel where he said they found
a suit case containing two pieces ef silk
and two dozen knives. In Henderson's
room was found half a dozen skeleton
keys, made from wire nails. Gottfried
said that several steel files were found
in a Ford car which ostensibly belonged
to Murphy, but which later had been
claimed by a man at Erie, 111. from
whom it had beenstolen, and which was
restored to the owner by the St. Paul
police.
Detective B. A. Carr, corroberated
the testimony of his brother officer, and
said he was in Murphy's room when
Burns came in and informed Murphy
that his "jitney" which he had been
driving was in frbnt of the hotel.
Both detectives said they had never
known anything of either Murphy or
Henderson until they had been assigned
tothe present case, information of which
came to them in a telegram from the
police force at Sioux City, Iowa. They
said they had heard of Burns for the
past six months.
Deputy Sheriff H. F. Jahnke told of
&*,
^^m^^^l^^shJr^j^Ms^
going to St. Paul and bringing the pris
oners, together with the recovered
property, to New Ulm, after they had
been turned over to him by the St. Paul
police department.
Negro On Stand
After Attorney Newman had made a
plea for the release of Henderson and
Burns, which Justice Henningsen said
he would take under advisement,
G. H. Jones, colored, a Pullman sleeping
car conductor, testified that Henderson
and his wife boarded his car at Fort
Dodge, Iowa, on the night of October 13,
and came to St. Paul, arriving there on
the following morning. He said he
was sure of the date, and when County
Attorney Frederickson asked him how
he remembered, he said:
"Yuh see, Boss, I'se running extra,
an'I said to de odder porter, 'What yuh
tink of dis, I'se got an extra on
Friday, de 13 what yuh tink of dat?'
Suah, Boss, I knows it was de right date."
The woman purporting to be Robert
Henderson's wife, followed Jones on the
stand. She said she and Henderson
came from Fort Dodge to St. Paul on
the night of the alleged robbery that
she bought the railway tickets and paid
for them and the sleeping car berth.
She said they traveled as Mr. and Mrs.
George Krause. She acknowledged in
answering a question by the district
attorney, that she was not married to
the young" prisoner. She had known
him about six months and had made
several trips with him.
Henderson Testifies
Henderson, on the stand said he was
19 years old, and insisted that he left
Fort Dodge on the night of October the
13th, and that he knew nothing of the
robbery and had never heard of Comfrey.
He said that Murphy's real name was
Arthur Henderson and that he was his
brother. He said they were brought up
in Fort Dodge that his father and
mother both live there trat his father's
name is J. G. Henderson. The young
man acknowledged that he had been
convicted of theft at Marshall, Minn.,
and served a sentence of thirty-two
days in jail in default of paying a fine
of $42.50, and that he served two months
in jail at Windom for grand larceny.
Attorney Newman made another plea
for the release of the two prisoners,
claiming there had been no evidence
to connect young Henderson and Burns
with the Comfrey robbery.
Goods To Be Returned
It is said by the authorities that the
man who was held to the grand jury,
has admitted his guilt and will plead
guilty when arraigned before Judge
Olsen in district court. Detective Gott
freid says he knows where the stolen
property with one or two exceptions,
is, and Attorney Newman has promised
that the goods, will be returned.
LARGE SUM IS REALIZED
FROM RED CROSS SUPPER
The Red Cross Committee which had
charge of the chicken supper at the
Armory October 31 held a meeting
Monday afternoon for the purpose of
auditing the bills and accepting the re
ports from the various sub committees.
After paying all the bills, the net amount
realized from the supper amounted to
$102.93 and the cash donations to $29.45,
a total of $132.38. After careful con
sideration the committee decided to

PUBLIC RECEPTION FOR
CITY SCHOOL TEACHERS
Members of the Current News Club
will entertain the teachers of the public
schools at a reception at the High School
Auditorium next Friday evening, No
vember 10. A committee composed of
Mrs. C. G. Reim, Mrs. G. F. Reineke,
Mrs. Emil Metzinger, Mrs. James
Dougher, and Mrs. Henry Held has
completed the arrangements for the
affair, which promises to be a great
success.
Members of the club and senior class
members will be in the receiving line and
a program of musical numbers will be
given. The general public is cordially
invited to be present. It is hoped that
parents, especially, will come and get
acquainted with the new teachers.
The club members feel that it is but
fitting that the teachers of the city should
know the people of the city better and
that they will feel more at home after
they have met, in a social way, the
parents and other citizens.
Both the Democrats and the Repub
licans were still "claiming" the elec
tion of their candidates for President
of the United States at an early hour
this morning.
According to a United Press wire
received at 3 o'clock, Chairman Willcox
of the National Republican Committee
was claiming the election of Hughes
by a majority of one in the Electoral
College, while Chairman Vance McCor
mick of the Democratic Committee
claimed twenty for Wilson. The result
in Indiana was in doubt and the state
was claimed by both parties.
Wisconsin as gone overwhelmingly
Republican, with Milwaukee leading, the
German-American vote in that city
turning almost solidly to Hughes.
New York, Ohio, Illinois, Connecticut
and Iowa are all Republican by large
majorities.
President Wilson retired at 12:30,
having been assured by his campaign
managers that he had been safely elected.
Kansas has probably gone Republican
by a close margin.
Oklahoma gives Wilson a plurality
of 5000.
At one o'clock it was reported^ by the
press wires that the Democratic news
papers of New York City had conceded
the election of Hughes.
The city of Mankato gave Hughes
a majority of 259. While the returns
from Blue Earth county were very meagre
it was estimated that the Republicans
had carried it by from 600 to 800.
Both branches of Congress inaU like
lihood, will have Republican major
ities.
Montana returns, altho meagre, in
dicated that the state had gone Demo
cratic. No returns were received af-

NEW ULM, BROWN COUNTY, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, NOV. 8, 1916.
Election in Doubt
i:
Early Returns Indicated a Landslide for Mr.
Hughes, But Later Figures Cause
Wilson Stock to Soar.
BOTH SIDES CLAIM VICTORY
City of New Ulm and Five Other Precincts in
Brown County Give Republicans a
Plurality of 665.
ter 1 o'clock this morning from that
section of the country.
Minneapolis and St. Paul gave Wil
son an 8000 lead but the few available
figures from the country districts in
dicated that the lead would be gradually
"reduced and the state might be listed in
the doubtful column until the very
last precinct is heard from.
Brown and Redwood Counties have
given the Republican nominee large
majorities, his plurality being estimated
last night at 750. While returns from
most of the townships have been very
slow in coming in, the figures at hand
at 4 o'clock this morning indicated
that the plurality for Hughes would be
several hundred. The two largest cities,
In the county, New Ulm and Sleepy
Eye were carried by the Republicans.
Springfield had not been heard from up
to a late hour.
Kellogg has evidently been elected
over Lawler for United States Senato
by an overwhelming majority.
Brown County returns indicate that
Praxel of Lamberton has defeated
Hauser of Sleepy Eye by a safe major-
One of the surprises of the election was
the_ astonishing vote piled up by Van
"Eear~ socialist candidate for mayor of
Minneapolis. The election has been
one of the most hotly contested in the
history of the Mill City and it would
seem at this time that Van Lear leads
Langum, Non-partisan, by several thou
sand.
Brown County returns as received
at the Review office up to 6:30 this
morning will be found in the supplement
accompanying this issue. Later returns
will be posted at the Review fice
during the day.

OCTOBER'S BEAUTIFUL
WEATHER GETS A JOLT
October's "Bright Blue Weather" got
a jolt this year when King Boreas loosed
his White Legions and they descended
upon the earth, blotting out the haze of
Indian Summer days and filling the heart
of man with fear of the long cold winter
and the ever-mounting cost of fuel.
Nearly six inches of snow fell to be ex
act, 5.85 inches according to Voluntary
Observer Henle. However, Dame
Nature has a soft spot in the heart for
Minnesota and it is always safe to bank
on considerable sunshine and warmth in
October, as may be seen by the figures
in the monthly report made "to the
government from this point as follows:
Mean temperature, 45.635 maximum
temperature, 77, on the 4th and 9th
minimum temperature, 19, on the 23d
total precipitation, .88 total snowfall,
for the month was five and eighty-five
one-hundredths inches. There were
ten clear days, fourteen partly cloudy
and seven. cloudy.
