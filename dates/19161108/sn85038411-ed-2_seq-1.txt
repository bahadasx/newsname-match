LXXXV— No. 260 14 PAGES
ELECTION IS STILL IN DOUBT
WITH RESUTLS VERY CLOSE
DAUPHIN COUNTY
FOR HUGHES WITH
2,418 PLURALITY
Senator Beidlcman Who Leads
Local Ticket Gets 4,592
Over Opponent
KREIDER IS RE-ELECTED
McCormick Fails to Carry Pre
cinct, Ward, City or
State
Dauphin county, which gave a ma
jority to Colonel Theodore Roosevelt
four years ago. swung Into the Repub
lican column yesterday with a plural
ity of 2,148 for Charles Evans Hughes
and a plurality of 4,592 for Senator
Edward E. Beldleman who led his
ticket. All of the Republican candi
dates In the city and county won, with
the exception of Augustus Wildman,
who was defeated by Ramsey Black.
Democrat, for one of the city's legisla
tive seats In a close fight.
Much interest was attached to the j
vote In Dauphin county throughout the j
State because of the fact that it is the
home county of the Democratic na
tional chairman, who, by the way.
Failed to get a majority for Wilson tn
his precinct, his ward, his city, his
:ounty or his State. Another thing
which caused unusual interest in Dau
phin county was the strenuous effort
made by the Democrats to win over
the Progressives, who seem to have
preferred the advice of Roosevelt to
.hat of McCormick.
Congressman Aaron S. Kreider who
was re-elected by _i substantial ma
jority, carried Dauphin county, Includ
ing Harrlsburg city which gave him a
fine vote, received a splendid testi
monial from his neighbors in Lebanon
and a good vote in Cumberland.
Justice Emory A. Walling, who had
the endorsement of the Dauphin I
county lawyers, was loyally supported j
not only in Dauphin but in the other !
counties of this district. Returns indi
cate that the vote for him in the State I
will run many thousands above that |
for Charles Palmer.
Vote For President
Justice Hughes carried both the citv
and the county having a total of 6,551
votes tn the city and 7.306 in the
county, an aggregate of 13,877. Wil
son had 6,0 41 votes In the city, and
6,395 in the county, a total of 11,439.
Benson, Socialist, had 330 in the citv,
505 in the county, a total of 835 and
Hanly, Prohibition, got 193 in Har
risburg and 213 in the county, a total '
of 408.
By far the most interesting contest
in the county was that for State sena
tor. Dr. William N. Yates, the Wash
ington party candidate who was run
ning on a local option platform, was
a poor third despite the fact that he
had the covert support of the news
paper of the Democratic national chair
man. Owing to this fact Alderman
George D. Herbert's friends consider
that he made a remarkable showing, !
having 4,249 votes In the city and 4,'095 I
in the county, or a total of 5.344 as com
pared wtth 2.284 for Yates in the city |
and 1,318 in the county, a total of 3.604. :
Senator Beldleman simply walked |
away with his two opponents, having a j
vote of 6,253 In Harrlsburg and 6.943 j
in the county outside, a grand total
of 13,196. This gives him a plurality
of 4,592 and a clear majority over all '
of 1,218. The Senator will be re-elcted '
president pro tem of the State Senate j
in January.
For United States Senator Phil- |
ander C. Knox polled 6,755 votes In |
the city and 6,405 in the county, a to- |
tal of 13,160 as compared with 6,191
votes for Ellis L. Orvla. the Democra- 1
tic candidate In the city and 4,360 In !
the county, a total of 10,155.
Senator Charles A. Snyder, who Is a
native of the upper end of Dauphin
coanty, won a fine vote In the city
and county, having 6,985 In the city
and 6,96 7 In the county, a total of 13,-
952. James Murrln, his rival for Audi
tor General, received 4,780 votes In the
city and 4,597 in the county—a total
of 9.377.
Harmon M. Kephart, for State
Treasurer, polled a total of 13,556 In
the county, the city slving him 6,671
and the county districts and boroughs
6,885. James M. Cramer. Democratic
candidate, had a total of 10,361 the
city giving 5,644 and the county' out
side 4,717.
The vote for Congressman Kreider in
Harrisburg was 6,300 and in the coun
ty districts 6,737, a total of 13.037. as
compared with 5,727 in Harrlsburg
and 4,821 In the county for H. B
Sauaaaman, his Democratic rival

large carried the county by figures
approximating those of Kreider.

I-ack of decisive reports on the out

Telegraph bulletins were watched all

When Harrlsburg went to bed last
night it felt reasonably certain that the
day had been won by the Republicans
and that Charles Evans Hughes had
been elected to the presidential chair.
The earliest dispatches of the day
seemed to confirm—until reports

EARLY RETURNS
INDICATED LONG
DRAWN OUT FIGHT
New York, Nov. B.—Tho result of
the election still was officially In doubt
to-day.
Upon doubtful States from which
the returns are slowly coming depends
whether Mr. Wilson has been re
elected or whether the net President
of the United States will be Charles
E. Hughes.
Chairmen of both national com
mittees claimed handsome majorities
in the electoral college for their can
didate but tho actual figures early to
day made good the claitrts of neither.
"They did however, show a steady
trend toward President "Wilson all
through the west.
Aside from the uncertainty of the
result the most remarkable thing
about the election was the sudden
wiping out of the Hughea majorities
