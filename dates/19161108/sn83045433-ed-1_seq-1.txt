Dr Iussw.m.. Nw. ......,
New York, Nov. 8.-Charles Evans Hughes
and Charles Warren Fairbanks have been elected
President atl Vice President of the United States
by a lead of approximately 77 in the Electoral
College over their opponents. Hughes now has
304 votes, Wilson 227. Four States are in doubt.
The latest returns indicate that the Repub
lican candidates have made almost a clean sweep
of the Northern, Eastern and Western States.
Ohio, Nebraska, Washington and Maryland
are still in doubt.
For a time toward midnight Massachusetts
was doubtful, but now seems safely in the.Hughes
column.
Delware, West Virginia ald Oregon. which had not 6e0
frrn early in the evening, have gone to Hughes. "
Utah, which four years ago was one of the two States that went
for Taft, has this year gone for Wilson. Montana has also given
her four electoral votes to Wilson.
So complete was the Republican sweep that there seems to be a
probability of an overturn of the Democratic majority in the House
of Representatives. Until complete returns are in it wil be imposi
ble to make a forecast, but the Repmslians now claim a majority of
ten or tweve votes.
SENATE MAJORITY DWINDLES.
'he Democratic majority in the Senate has been heaviy cut Jow. but
the Democratic control will still be sue by four or five votes.
In New York, which formaer Gov. Hughes carried by450,0 or smare.
Gov. Whitman has won a victory over his Democratic opponent. Saml Se.
bury, by uearly 200.000.
Wiliam . Calder. Republican candidate for United States Saeor. de
feated William F, McCombs. Democrat. by considerably mom than 200000.
Although all the Wilson newspapers in Greater New York --acedud
Hughes' election by midnight. the Democratic managers steadfasiy i
that Wilson had been elected.
"DOUBTFULS" GO TO HUGHES.
' Illinoi diana Wisconsin and Michigan. all doubtful Sta and a
daimed by the Democrats by big majorities, have all turned into the Hughes
column. Ohio is still in the balance.
In Blinois. where the women v&ed for President. the Hughes ain
approached 200,000. The relative vote of the men and women w& almat
the same. which meas that the women favored Hughes almost to the su
extent that the men did.
Connecticut, confidently claimed by the Wilson leaders, was among
the first States to show that it was for the Republican candidate. WVh it
went all New Fngland. including Massachusetts, when the Hughes majeo
was something like 8,000.
Cities with g~eat German populations, such as Cincimnai, St. Levi
and Milwukee, pled up huge pluralities for Hughes. Hamiton Couny.
Ohio, in which Ccinnati is locaed, went for Hughes by 18.000. whi
Cuyahoga Coung. which surrounds Cleveland, was for Wilson. Whenever
ther was a of Germn-Americas tesidents these was a majority
for Haghw **:
