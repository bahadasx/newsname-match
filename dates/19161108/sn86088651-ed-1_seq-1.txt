New York, Nov. 8. Tho result of

still In doubt at 2 o'clock today. Up to
that time Wilson had been practically
assured of 232 electorial votes, Hughes
215, with 84 In doubt. Of the latter,
Hughes was claiming California and
Minnesota. Further Inroads into Wil

son had polled 111,000 and Hughes
103,000.
Early this afternoon Democratic
The returns received laHt night by
both the Associated Press and West

election of Hughes and caused some
of the Texas - papers, notably tbo
Houston Chronicle and Houston Post,
to issue "extras" proclaiming a "land
slide" for Hughes. The reports re
ceived by the Eagle, however, which
covered all parts of the North, East,
West and Middle West, showed that
the vote waa close and the leaders
were running neck and nook.
After midnight the reports were
more favorable to Wilson and at 2
1
o'clock the Dallas News reported to
the Eagle that there was nothing in
the reports to Indicate anybody's elec
tion and the count would have to pro-
reed much further before anything
tike an accurate forecast could be
made. .
The early returns this morning were
favorable to Wilson and during the

jubilant while the Republican rejoic
ing of last night gave way to doubt
and marked disappointment

To Carry Out Plaits for New Buildings
at State University, a Large
8um Will Be Required,
(Rv Associated Premi.)
Austin, Texas, Nor. 8. In order to
carry out Its plans for the erection of
new buildings to meet the growing
needs of the University of Texas, the
board of regents of that Institution
has decided to ask the next legislature
for authority to issue $3,500,000 in
bonds against the available Income of
the university.
Under the present laws the legisla
ture can only provide for the mainte
nance of tHe university and funds fer
building purposes must be derived
'rom Its lands and interest. It Is
claimed that these funds do not ac
cumulate fast enough to meet the
growing needs of the Institution. The
alternative Is for the lands of the uni
versity to be sold. This step, how
ever, Is not favored by the regents. '
The plan In view is to Issue bonds,
interest and sinking fund for which
can be met by the annual Income avail
able for building purposes.

SALE OF THE
! A!
Sold Within a Month After Winning
the World's 8erles May Be
More Changes.
New York, Nor. 8. The sale of the
Boston American League club within
a month after the team bad won the
world's championship Is thought by
many close followers orbaseball poli
tics to mark the first of a number of
changes and readjustments in major
league circles. Former President J.
J. Lannln made no secret of the fact
that the Red Sox were for sale and If
rumors and Inner circle gossip can be
accepted at face value, several other
club owners are just as willing to dis
pose of their holdings, but lack the
frankness of Lannln.
The president of the Boston Ameri
cans placed a price of $"50,000 upon
the club early In the present year and,
It la understood, was offered and re
fused 8500,000. Under the clrcum- t
stances the sale of the Red Sox, while
the glamor of the world'a series vic
tory was still fresh, at $675,000 ap
pears In the light of a compromise.
Judging from past results and attend
ance figures at Boston the new owners
made an excellent deal when the ralue
of the club, franchise and park prop
erty is taken Into consideration.
- The Boston dub entered the Ameri
can League In 1901 and . since that
season has won the Junior league pen
nant five times and the world'a cham
pionship three tunes. In the sixteen
years the Red Sox have finished
fourth or better every season except
In 1906-7-8 and 1911. The average po
sition of the team for the full period
works out as 34. Furthermore Boa
ton has always been noted as a good
baseball town, supporting Its clubs
i with consistency, whether winners or
not
Harry Frasee, the new head of the
club, while a young man, has always
been a close follower of sports and la
far from being a novice In the promot
ing line. In addition to his many the
atrical ventures, he baa backed aever
al sporting events of more than ordi
nary prominence, including the
heavyweight championship bout at
Havana. Cuba, when Jess Wlllard
wrest the title from Jack Johnson. As
a result he docs not enter big league
baseball circles without preliminary
training. Because of his knowledge
of the amuscement trend of the
American public, Fraxee ahould prove
a valuable addition to the roster of
baseball magnates.
