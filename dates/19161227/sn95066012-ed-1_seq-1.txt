day morning regarding the hold up.
Griggs was sitting in a rocking
chair in the office when he heard the
doors of the main entrance open. He
looked around and found himself gaz
ing into the muzzle of a revolver in
the hands of a man he describes as
being about 5 feet 8 inches tall, weigh
ing about 180 pounds, dressed in a
short overcoat and dark clothes,
wearing a bandana handkerchief for
a mask.
At first Clerk Griggs thought the
affair a joke but he changed his mind
suddenly when the bandit pushed the
gun so close to his face that he
seemed to feel the clammy touch of
the steel.
.''Here, you," said -the robber. "Get
up and give me all the money in sight
and be d n quick about it."
"W-h-a-t do you mean?" quavered
tho dapier clerk.
"I mean the money, m-o n e-y, the
hotel cash," said the masked man,
moving his weapon still closer tow

miles east of tho Suez Canal, a Brit
ish War Office announcement issued
today says that virtually the entire
Turkish force of about 2,000 men was
destroyed. The text of the statement
reads:
"The following probably are the
final details regarding Maghdabah.
The total captures were 1,350 prison
ers, including forty-five officers, four
mountain guns, three Krupp guns, a
large number of rifles, 100,000 rounds
of small ammunition, some gun am- ,
munition, a number of horses and i
camels and telephone and other

"Fitch!" he yelled to the bellhop,
who was asleep in on a couch in the
office. "Fitch "
Bellhop Fitch awoke with a start
and prepared to answer the agonized
call for help. But he didn't. Instead,
after taking one look at the drama
unfolded before his eyes, he gave a
shriek and dashed uff up the stairs
which load to the southeast wing of
the hotel.
The bellhop's hasty exit gave a
brilliant Idea to Grigirs. who turned
from his perilous position in front r'
the robber and followed the boy pell
mcll. This left the masked man
alone in the office and he profited by
the situation.
With a heavy tool of some descrip
tion the man pried open tho money
drawer which is under the desk and
took all the money. Tho safe, which
contained a large sum of cash, was
locked, consequently the only loot
secured by the robber was the

found In tho drawer.

the representatives of the press at
Petrograd yesterday to au interview,
at which he outlined his program and
his ideas in regard to the present
IoIitlcal situation. Reuter's Petro

eral this Ministerial declaration,
which seems to have been meant to
take the place of the usual speech be
fore Parliament, consisted of a rew
clear propositions:
First. There has been no change
in tho relations between Russia and
her allies.
Second The Minister declared
with firm assurance that after the
war tho military alliance ot France,
England and Russia would be consoli
dated In a close economic union,
j Third. The war will be continued,
, according to this declaration, until a
I decisive victory has been won.
Mr. Pokrovski then discussal the
three great questions of the day the
German peace proposal, President Wil
son's note, and the attitude of Greece.
I After recalling the recent Duma
declaration in regard to the German
peace note, M. Pokrovski passed to
the action of President Wilson, say
ing Russia appreciated highly the
good-will and the lofty, humane nio

the Russian Government in regard to
Mr. Wilson's action were almost
analogous with those which had been
set forth by the Russian press; that
is to say, tho Government's attitude
in regard to both questions was one
of complete refusal.
Complete official returns on the
compiled by
The Associated Press, the last of
them having been received yesterday,
show that Wilson received 9,116.296
votes, and Hughes 8,547,474, a plurali

The total popular vote for the four
candidates was 18,638,871, against 15,

of 3,594,549, accounted for by the In

Road to Brattleboro Part of New Auto
Tour Line.
Relative to proposed Improvements
to an automobile route connecting
New York state and the New England
coast, The New York Herald prints
the following:
One of the most picturesque and de
lightful regions of the East is to be
opened in New England to automobil
ists by the Improvement of the Molly
Stark trail and the Great Green Way.
It is the design to make a better link
between the network of good roads in
New York state and the New England
coast, and also with the White Moun
tains and Maine. The matter is well
in hand by Influential men In Ver
mont and New Hampshire, the two
states which aro traversed by this
historic route. Some aid from the
legislature in each state is expected
to be given this winter nd by next
summer the way will be ready for
the thousands of automobile tourists
who will invade a section heretofore
relatively little known to them.
Tho route starts In New York state
at Troy, where, of course, is connec
tion with numerous routes north,
south and west. Across Vermont the
route passes through Bennington, rich
in Bcenery as well as In historic
memories, - then through Wilmington
and Brattleboro. This part of the
route is known as the Molly Stark
Trail. In the open seasons it is al
ways resplendent in the variety of its
scenery, indeed as much or even more
than the more generally known Mo
hawk Trail, which is parallel and
south of it. Of course it has been
less travelol on account of stretches
of pocr road which now It is proposed
to Improve iu the most satisfactory
way.
Passing from Brattleboro into New
Hampshire the route becomes the
Great Green Way, a most appropriate
name, for the road passes through the
very heart of the famous pine belt of
New Hampshire. There is a wealth
of woods and wooded mountainsides
with bold contrusts in color against
the background of green which every
where greets the vision of the tour
ist. New Hampshire is ente'red by
the town of Chesterfield, which con
tains the charming Lake SimlTord.
Tho route here skirts the lake and af
fords a variety In landscape that Is al
ways pleasing.

CHRISTMAS COTILLION
Will Be Held at Foresters Haii Thurs
day Evening.
One of the most enjoyable events
of the holiday season is the annual
Christmas Cotillion given under the
auspices of Public Welfare Associa
tion, the proceeds of which go toward
the furtherance of the work of that
organiaztion. In previous years this
dance has always been a marked so
cial success 83 well as being of ma
terial benefit to a worthy work. This
year's event promises to eclipse all
others, under the supervision of Mrs. I
George M. Hawks, as chairman, as-1
sisted by the following able commit
tee, consisting of Mrs. George Graves.
Mrs. Edward Bradford. Mrs. Robert
E. Healy, Mrs. C. V. Thatcher, Miss
Hilda Pratt, Philip T. H. Pierson and
John P. Mulligan. It will be held
Thursday evening at Foresters hall.
Realizing that one of the most Im
portant features of a dance Is tho
music, an especially fine six piece or
chestra is to be furnished by Mr.
Donnely. Both old and new dances
will be given the one step and waltz,
the two step and fox trot with a
couple of five steps. The decorations
are in the hands of Harry SouthaR.
Mr. Mann of the Y. M. C A. with a
bevy of small boys has already ob
tained a large amount of greenery,
spruce roping with polnsettas will be
used mainly keeping to thn holiday
colors of red and green. The favors,
which are being very generosuly giv
en by Mrs. Hawks, are most attrac
tive and unique. The Camp Fire
Girls have assisted in making some of
them. There will be 8 favor dances
in all for ladles and four for gentle
men. Mrs. Paulson has been engaged
to make the punch.
At 8.30 o'clock there will be a short,
reception by officers of the association
and members of the committee. The
grand march will start at 9 o'clock
and all guests are requested to as
semble promptly. About 500 tickets
were sent out, many of which have
not yet been returned. The commit
tee would deem it a favor if all who
have not sent In their tickets would
do so at once. Extra tickets may bo
obtained at the door or upon applica
tion to Mr. Pierson.
