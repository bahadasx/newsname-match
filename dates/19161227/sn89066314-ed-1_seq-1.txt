Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo,
ia a message this morning to Jewell
Mayes, secretary of the State Board
of Asriculture' sa,(1 tnat he wil1 en"
dcavor to be present some time dur
ing Farmers' Week.
He also states that Herbert Quick of
the Federal Farm Loan Board has ac
cepted the invitation of the State
Board of Agriculture to appear on the
program.
The evening programs under the
direction of the State Board of Agri
culture are to deal with questions of
the hour and will be of wide range
and popular in character. Many
speakers who have a national reputa
tion will appear on the' evening pro
grams. The program on Monday night has
been arranged for the interest of Co
lumbia persons as well as the visitors.
It has been made attractive and edu
cational in nature. Uel W. Lamkin.
state superintendent of schools, will
speak on the "Call of the County
School to Missouri." Upon this sub
ject Mr. Lamkin is thoroughly ac
quainted, having made investigations
and studied the conditions of the rural
schools of Missouri for a number of
years.
Another interesting speaker Monday
night is Dr. H. J. Waters, president of
the Kansas Agriculture College. Doc
tor Waters was formerly dean of the
College of Agriculture of the Univer
sity. His subject for the evening will
be "Living Within Our Income." It
will cover the agricultural and eco
nomic conditions in the United States
and after the close of the European
War.
Word was received today that Sir
Horace plunkett of Ireland, who ac
cepted an invitation to Farmers' Week
upon the condition that he would ar
rive in this country in time, would not
be able to appear on Thursday night's
program, owing to the fact that he
finds it Impossible to arrive here be
fore the middle of January.
Early last November Mr. Mayes sent
out a special call to county courts,
granges, farmers' clubs and commer
cial clubs urging the appointing of
delegates to Farmers' Week. It was
urged that each county court appoint
one delegate for each township, and
each commercial club appoint one
delegate for every ten members.
The Hannibal Commercial Club
quickly accepted the suggestion, and
word comes from that city that a spe
cial car will bring the delegates to
Columbia Sunday. Other commercial
clubs and county courts have respon
ded to the suggestion and are mak
ing arrangements to send delegates.
The members of the State Board of
Agriculture will arrive in Columbia
Sunday. The first meeting of the
board will be held at 10 o'clock Tues
day morning. President P. P. Lewis
"will be one of the speakers on Monday
evening.

Allies Want a Guarantee of
World Peace to Follow
Proposed Meeting.
By United Tress
WASHINGTON. Dec. 27. Despite
the general feeling of restlessness
among all government officials over
prospects for peace in the light of
Germany's latest communication many
believe today that President Wilson
will strive to the utmost to prevent
the situation getting beyond his gasp.
Two reasons they state will actuate
him; namely, a desire to end the war
and a desire, if possible, to avoid hav
ing to put through his threat to break
relations with Germany should she
overstep her submarine promises.
This was the most serious problem
for Germany does not promise to link
the guarantee of world peace to the
outcome of the proposed round table
conference. The allies want such a
seam included.
Wilson's friends hold he has placed
himself in the position of a partial me
diator and hence cannot quit now un
less his ideas are thrown down hard
and fast.
Prof. Usher Mukes Prediction.
By United Press
CINCINNATI,, Dec. 27. Rollin G.
Usher, professor at Washington Uni
versity of St. Louis who in his book
"Pan-Germanism," published in 1913,
qualified as a prophet by predicting
accurately the great war including the
invasion of Belgium, said in a speech
here today.
"The war may last from three years
to ten years longer if the allies insist
on the terms recently announced.
There will be no permanent peace for
more than fifty years. Russia has
considering causes for abandoning her
allies. If she does this Germany will
win.
"The war's next step may be the
conquest of Italy and an attack of
France from the rear. The United
States must make a defensive alliance
with Great Britain against Japan and
other potential enemies."

COLUMBIA MISSOURI, WEDNESDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 27, 1916.
WILSON'S PLURALITY
IAS 518J47 VOTES
Figures Based on Official
Count Announced Today
By United Press.
GAINS 28 PER CENT
Democratic Increase, How
ever, Nothing Like That
of Republicans.
By United Tress
. NEW YORK, Dec. 27. President
Woodrow Wilson will be president of
the United States for four years more
by the outcome of-the recent election
with a plurality of 518,147 out of a to
tal of 18,110,777 votes cast on Novem
ber 7 for the two major political
parties.
This total does not include votes for
the Socialist, Prohibition or Labor
candidates. The figures announced to
day by the United Press are based in
the majority of cases on the official
counts of the states.
Four years ago Wilson polled, 6,-
293,019 votes. The Democratic total
this year was an increase of twenty
eight percent over these figures. Sim
ilarly the Republican nominee in 1912
polled 3,484,956 whose total in 1916
was an increase of about 112 percent.
The total vote cast for the two ma
jor parties was 1,579,981 more than
that cast in 1912 for the then three
major political parties. In other words,
there was an increase in 1916 of more
than eleven percent of the total vote
cast.
There is no way to determine on the
basis of the figures themselves what
became of the progressive votes regis
tered for Roosevelt four years ago. ,
Every state in the Union had a big-
ger total vote than four years ago,
Montana led the list with the biggest
increase and Illinois jumped her total
over of 1912 by 101 percent.
PROBES MARKET LEAK
U. S. Representative Investi
gates Rumor of Wall
Street.
By United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec. 27. Represen
tative Woods' search for evidence re
garding the rumored leak to Wall
Street of Information pertaining to the
Wilson peace note led him into diplo
matic circles and into the homes of
relatives of the highest officials of the
United States, he told the United Press
this afternoon.
In an interview today Representa
tive Woods said, "I am Informed that
a relative of a high official now in the
brokerage business as a silent partner
is said to have profited immensely by
the advance information of the Presi
dent's peace note."
"I am not in position to reveal the
name at present, but may do so at any
time," said Mr. Woods.
"I also learned that representatives
of this government in foreign capitals
profited by this advance information.
This is not at all extraordinary as
members of our diplomatic corps had
the news before the release of the
message in this country, and this
gave them ample time to cable in
structions to their brokers."

National Suffrage Figure at
Home in Columbia Tells
of Work.
MOVEMENT GAINING
Congressmen Are Now Will
ing to Listen to Arguments
For Women's Votes.
"It's a great game," says Mrs. Wal
ter McNab Miller, First Vice-President
of the National Woman Suffrage Asso
ciation, who has just come to Colum
bia from the turmoil of affairs in
Washington. She is a busy woman,
even at home, but never too busy to
kindle to enthusiasm when you talk
of suffrage.
"I don't see, how any woman with
any pretense of a mind can fail to be
stimulated immensely by such work,"
she declared. It is fascinating to
watch the interchange of ideas, the
play of personality in politics actions
and reactionaries" she added, with a
twinkle.
"You see, we suffragists are persona
grata in Congress now. In the first
place we don't heckle the President
we are dead against the nagging mili
tarist policy of the English women.
And then tco, the members of Con
gress have had a change of heart
or perhaps a change of head since the
last election. They are always inter
ested when we go to a man's office
he is anxious to talk suffrage is no
longer a visionary idea to be laid aside
for the millenlum; it is a today's is
sue, very much alive. We occupy a
very strategic position, you know"
and Mrs. Miller looked diplomatic
since the last Atlant' Convention we
decided to adopt a non partisan poli
cy, and the Congressman, Republican
or Democrat, that is not against us is
pretty likely to be for us.
No Blocking of Votes.
"For instance, you rarely find them
blocking the vote, which used to be
a habit in the old days. One gets a
good deal of fun out of watching peo
ple keep their footing on a political
platform. It is necessary to watch
your step of you're only too likely to
put your foot in it."
Mrs. Miller was asked what she
thought of Congressman as govern
ment experts.
"Experts?" she said "expert dodg
ers, you mean. I never saw anything
like the way the average congressman
hates to stand up to a vote. They
have made fillibustering a fine art."
Asked her general impression of
Washington politics she looked du
bious. "To a novice," she said, "it
seems pretty much as if Congress did
not find the people's interests very in
teresting. Hints at Money Patriotism.
"They all react to local stimuli
state and small town affairs they
have none of what we are accustomed
to call the statesmans attitude no po
litical vision. Of course one hears a
lot about preparedness. The Ameri
can Eagle is flapping his wings and
screaming louder than he ever did be
fore, but I should not wonder if his
voice still sounds most seductive on
a dollar. However the men we talk
to have been particularly interested in
proving fraud in the referendum. We
have come to believe that a State
Legislature represents more fairly the
average American intelligence at
least it is higher level than the Sioux
Indian or immigrants."
Mrs. Miller, who is now the chair
man of the Washington Committee
has more work on her hands than the
average postoffice force at Christmas.
She manages affairs for both men and
women. As head of the Washington
work she is busy with lobbying social-political
work, and she calls it,
the purely social work, bringing
friends and opponents together to get
a general background of opinion, and
the Congressional work in the dis
tricts which consists in letting the
states know what is being done and
what is needed.
Suffrage Work Varied.
Woe to the Congressman that has
only the courage of other peoples con
victionseverybody will know it back
home. "Besides all this," says Mrs.
Miller, we are organizing state groups
in the city no one ever lives in Wash
ington, you know, and they can sup
plement our work In their own
states." In fact a moments conver
sation with Mrs. Miller is a startling
refutation of the old adage that wom
en cannot understand business. She
handles technical terms with a daz
zling virtuosity, quotes dates, statis-

MR. WILSON 60 TOMORROW
President Shows Ajre But Is Now Well
and Strong.
By United Press
WASHINGTON. Dec. 27. The Pres
ident of the United States will be 60
years of age tomorrow. At this, the
beginning of his second term as Pres
ident, he shows his years much more
than he did at the beginning of his
occupancy of the White House In 1912.
He is a bit more stooped than then and
the heavy lines in his face are much
more sharply drawn than they were
before he came through the interna
tional crises that have confronted him
since the war began. He is, however,
strong and well.
Letters, telegrams and remembranc
es from friends and relatives began
pouring into the White House by
scores today.

"Cadet War."

University Women Played
Santa Claus To Machine
Gun Company.
"We'e hiked through the dust and the
cactus,
We'ie hiked under the heat and the rain;
lint ns lung as we keep our jviihcs.
We neer will hike again."
The foregoing are the words of Lee
S. Eads, a student of the University,
who is at the present time a member
of Company F of the Fourth Regi
ment at Laredo, Tex.
In a letter to Mrs. Carrie George,
matron of Lathrop Hall, Mr. Eads tells
of the Christmas spirit on the border.
He says:
"The old Missouri Christmas spirit
is certainly absent In the soldiers'
camps. I suppose instead ot turkey
and other Christmas dishes that typi
fy the Missouri Christmas dinner, we
will be served with canned beet and
beans. Trying to find appropriate
Christmas gifts in this place is like
trying to buy a square meal in a gro
cery store."
On a 23-MHe Hike.
He also tells about the removal of
the National Guards. "I read in the
Daily Missourian," he says, "that the
Commercial Club asked for the return
of Company F only. No single com
panies are being returned. The ef
fort should be for the return of the
Fourth Regiment instead of for the
individual companies.
"We are all weary and footsore from
a four-day manuever this week, hav
ing hiked about twenty-five miles and
'fought' our way back to Laredo.
About 3,500 men participated.
"And now they tell us that we are to
get a ten or eleven day hike next
week. Believe me, home grub would
have tasted good about last Wednes
day. On our last hike we were served
a slice of bread, two spoonfuls of raw
tomatoes, a piece of onion and some
corned beef three times a day.
"We figured it up the other day and
found that we have served about
twelve years of University cadet 'war,'
so maybe that will be of some comfort
to the freshman who complains be
cause he is required to drill three
times a week."
Mr. Eads believes that the possibili
ties of the Fourth Regiment being
sent homeward before the second se-'
mester are discouraging. The border
boys are practically living in winter
quarters. The tents have been walled
three boards high, floored and doors
put in. Hot water has been installed
In the bath houses. With such ar
in .the bath houses. With such ar
rangements, it is believed by the mem
bers of the Fourth Regiment, that the
Government intends to keep them on
duty through the winter and possibly
longer.
Candy From Here to Border.
J. F. Brittingham, who received his
degree from the School of Engineering
in 1915, and who is now a sergeant in
the Maryland Cavalry now at San An
tonio, is visiting with former Univer
sity friends who are members of the
Fourth Regiment. Mr. Brittingham
was a major In the University cadet
corps during his last year in school.
Miss Hazel George, Miss Rose Arm
strong and several other University
women hit upon the idea of playing
the role of Santa Claus with the bor
der boys. Last week they got togeth
er in the Cafeteria kitchen and made
several pounds ot delicious candy.
Saturday they sent their candy to the
border boys with their merry Christ
mas wishes.
IS TRYING FOR TROOPS' RELIEF
Senator Reed Doing All In Porter to
Obtain Fourth Missouri's Release.
Mayor J. M. Batterton has received
a letter from Senator James A. Reed
saying that he would do and was doing
all in his power to obtain the release
the Fourth Missouri National Guard
from service at the border. Senator
Reed, Speaker Champ Clark and Rep.
Dorsey W. Shackleford were appeal
ed to by the mayor and several o.her
Columbia citizens to do what they
could for the returning of the com
pany. The Mayor, however. Is very pessi
mistic about the matter and says that
he doesn't hope for the company's re
lease for some time. "Some compan
ies had to be kept on the border, I
guess," he said, "And it ust happened
that ours was one."
