GERMANY TO SEND
TERMS TO WILSON
IF
Would Ask Though That
These Be Published Only
by Mutual Consent
PRESIDENT ACTUATED
BY TWO STRONG REASONS
One to Bring War To An End,
the Other to Avoid
Complications
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Dec. 27. Despite a gen
eral feeling of hopelessness among gov
ernment heads over prospects for peace,
in the light of Germany's latest com
munication, men closest to President
Wilson believed Today he will strive to
the utmost to prevent the situation get
ting beyond his grasp.
Two reasons they say will actuate
him, namely:
A desire to end the war and a desire,
if possible, to avoid having to put
turougil ins Sussex note threat to break
relations with Geiniauy should she over
step her submarine pledges.
Officials made no secret, of their pes
simism over the allied rejection of the
German proposal for a round talile con
ference. This was the more empMHo because
Germany does, not propo now to link
the idea of a world r . uauty with
the round table session, ently. The
allies want such a theme . uled.
Door is Still Oim-
Men in touch with WiUuii, however,
said the "door is not closed" and that
while the allies may throw down the
German conference idea hard, Wilson
still can move again, especially with the
backing of neutrals.
Wilson's friends held he has placed
himself in the position of at least a
potential mediator and hence cannot
quit now unless his ideas are thrown
down hard and fast.
While the idea of obtaining peace is
uppermost in administration minds,
there is among the inner circle a pro
found idea that a break with Germany
is inevitable if present peace proposals
fail utterly.
In fact one of the highest officials
told the United Press today that
ent plans call for no more iiote writiuc
r w
to vreriuaiiy.
He added, if the Marina, Arabia and
other cases develop clear cut violation
of German pledges in the Sussex cam..
or if Germany starts a new submarine
campaign in case peace Tails, then a
DreaK in relations can be the only
answer.
He declared that President Wilson's
"peace" note and Secretary Lansing's
subsequent "verge of war" statement
werA in a measure educational that the
country would not wonder what it was
all about in event matters came up to
tho breaking point.
Will tSate Her Terms.
Washington, Dec. 27. If President
Wilsoa will get from the entente allies
their terms of peace, Germany "" probab
ly" will furnish to the president the
Teuton terms, it was stated at the Ger
man embassy today.
Central power diplomats agreed with
this belief. They said thev do not ex
pect any move from President Wilson
until England's replv to his peace note
is received. Should President Wilson
thereupon transmit the German reply to
England and should England officially
ask for Germany's peace terms through
the president, it is thought probable
Germany would reply favorably if a
similar concession was made by Eng
land. In such an event, however, Germany,
it was said, would prefer both sets of
peace terms to be hulrl t MtlMntll inn.

Government Will Wait Short

By Carl D. Groat
(United lress staff correspondent)
Washington, Dec. 27 Two develop
ments that closely followed each other
today thrust tho Mexican situation to
the foreground here.
The first was an unsolicited state
ment from the state department that
unrest in northern Mexico is growing
and that as a result administration
attention once more is focused toward
the border.
The second was announcement fy
Secretary of the Interior Lane that he
has issued a call for a conference of
the American members of the American-Mexican
commission "at some ear
ly date," probably this week. tJp to
noon no word had been received as to
whether General Carranza had signed
the troop wilhdrawal protocol agreed
upon by the commission.
In its statement the department de
clared it had information that large
groups or bandits are on the rampage
and that the situation "is such as to
give the department fresh eonccrn."

Thinks This Would Force

United States to Act
By Webb Miller.
(Cnited Press staff correspondent.)
El Paso, Texas, Dec. 27. That Villa's
objective is Tampion and that the band
it leader is setting the stage for an at
tack upon that Mexican seaport was in
dicated in reports obtained today by
United State diplomatic agents here.
Although no official confirmation
has been received, authorities here are
inclined to accept the report that Villa
forces are now in possession of Han
Luis Potosi, cutting off communication
betweten Tampico and the west. Mili
tary men here believe that a separate
force o'f bandits must have gono south
if the city is now in Villa 's hands.
Officers close to the bandit chieftain
told foreigners in Chihuahua City that
Villa planned to take Tampico and
forco international complications and
action against the Carranzista govern
ment by the United States. Fuel for
the English fleet is drawn from the oil
fields in that region and Villa bolieves
that England would imedmiately force
the United States government to act if

ted States diplomatic agents here Villa
in all probability will next move upon
Saltillo and Monterey, the only two po
sitions of any importance between his
present base at Torreon and Tnmpico.
Private dispatches from Queretaro state
that the Carranzista government is mak
ing the greatest effort to round up ev
ory available man into the campaign
against Villa. With the railway cut at
San Luis Potosi, progress of the gov
ernment forces north will be hindered.
Authentic reports received here today
tell of the capture of an entire division
of Carranzistas, numbering 2,500 by Vil
listas at San Pedro, following the fall
of that city. The government troops
were being rushed toward Torreon to
reinforce the garrison there, but were
cut off -and taken prisoners by the
bandits-
New York Is Facing
Big Labor Struggle
New York, Dec. 27. New Years day
promises to find New York engaged

Nine labor organizations with more

to be effective that day.
The big drive of the Hotel and Res
taurant Employes' International Alli
ance will be at its peak when 1917 is
ushered in. Onion officials promise to
carry the strike into the "lobster
zone" and along Ilroadway on that
day, and claim they will have four
thousand waiters out in sympathy with
the union members south of Union
Square, who are scheduled to walk out
tomorrow.
Announcement of plans to call out
15,090 shirtmukers, who are demand
ing a 20 per cent increase in wages,
has been triads by union officials.
Other organizations which are plan
ning strikes include watch muKcrs,
book makers, petticoat makers, white

San Francisco, Dec. 27. That the
trial of Franz Bopp, German consul
general and attaches of his office will
be ready for the jury before New
Years day, was the belief expressed by
lawyers in the case today.
Taking of testimony is expected to
end tomorrow night or Friday and
then final arguments will be heard.
Speculation was rife today as to
whether President John A. McGregor
cf the Union Iron Works would be
called to the stand.
Theodore Itoche, counsel for Bopp, to
day expressed the belief that if Mc
Gregor was permitted to take the stand
he would tell of his concern's making
submarine parts for England.

MEN IN TRENCHES
ARE AGIST PEACE
Feeling Is That His Note Sim
ply Smooths the Way for
Germany
By William Philip Simms.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
With tho British Armies in France,
Doc. 27. "Never has the British army
been so prepared to fight; why should
we talk peace?' '
"You can safely give that as the Bri
tish army's answer to all peace talk,"
declared a staff general today in answer
to questions, as to what he and his men
thought of President Wilson's note.
To say that the American note fell
like a bombshell here is putting it mild
ly. Bombshells are always expected
hereabouts, whereas such a step as that
taken by the American president was
remotest removed from all thoughts.
The move was variously commented
upon by the fighting men. Nobody
doubted for an instant the president 's
good intentions in the suggestions, but
the foeling was that strong influences
had succeeded in inducing him to be
liovethis was nn opportune moment to
act. Such action was regarded as smooth
ing Germany 's road and enabling her
to take the second step in her peace
program.
Sentiment at the front is uncondition
ally against peace now. Every indica
tion points to much worse conditions in
Germnny than the world even suspects;
on the other hand, the allies are dally
better situated to wage a successful of

ENGLAND TO TELL

IS FIGHTING FOB
Ministry In Conference Draft
ing Reply to President's
Note
COMES OFF HIGH HORSE
WILL TALK BUSINESS
Belief Germany Realizes She
Is Weakening Causes
English Pei mess
By Ed L. Keen.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
London, Dec. 27. England intends to
tell the world exactly what she'ie fight
ing for. Her answer to President Wil
son's note suggesting that belligerent
in the great war define their peace
terms will be a clear outline of the ob
jects which Great Brituin and her alhea
hopo to attain.
That this sort of a note is now in
process of formation was learned on un
questioned authority by the United
Press this afternoon.
Presumably it was this busines sof
drafting the reply which called the min
istry into conference at Premier Lloyd
George's official residence in Downing
street today.
It is known that yesterday Lloyd
George conferred at length with Alex
ander Kibot, minister of finanee in the
French cabinet, and Albert Thomas,
minister of munitions and manufactures
of the Briand ministry. This conference
probably had as if a object also the ques
tion of a joint or at least an identical
note from all the allies, not only in
answer to President Wilson 's peace sug
gestions, but also in answer to the Ger
man note.
The outline of the reasons why Kmg
laud and her allies are fighting will
probably not go into minute detail, bat
it will be sufficiently definite on aU
questions to answer comprehensive!'
what the allieg are fighting for.
It is apparent from the above di
patch that England intends diplomatic
ally to force Germany into a positioav '
of strategic disadvantages in her forth
coming answer.
Germany failed to answer what was
considered the main point of the Wilson
note tho suggestion for an outline rf
peace terms. Moreover, she failed to
submit any statement of principles for
which she is contending, which might
be taken as indicative of what her
peace terms would be.
Will Not Accept Proposals.
London, Dec. 27. The allies certain
ly will not accept Germany's proposal
in her note to America, for an immedi
ate peace conference. That was entire
ly clear today.
But the Teutonic reply to President
Wilson 's note was hailed here aa afford
ing a splendid opportunity for England
and her allies to set before the world
a statement which would concretely epi
tomize the ideals and aims of the ea
tento powers in the war.
By her lack of sincere responaiveneas

England declares Germany is self coa
