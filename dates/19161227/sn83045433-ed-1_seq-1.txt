Pa Hopes on Two petata.
There were two poesible lines of diplo
matic development to which the peace
advocates, with the President at their
head, pinned their hopes.
The vague and un'ikely possibility that
the entente powers would not flatly re.;
ject Germany's suggestion In her note
of yesterday to the United States that a
peace conference be called immediately.
The positive attitude of the entente
powers as outlined by Premier Lloyd
George's recent speech to the British
Parliament and the apparent unanimity
of Great Britain-a allies in the deter
minatiun to continue the war made this
hope a tenuous one.

In the hands of the United States a
statement of peace terms, to be kept

course of procedure would drag out tha

PEACE CONFERENCES
Will Extend Invitation to Bellierents.
Is European Belief.
(y the Internatleai News se)vies.)
Amsterdam. Dec. 26.-Germany's any
swer to President Wilson's note. made,
public today, is nothing short of a
hint for an-invitation from a neutral
country to all the belligerents to serd
delegates to a neutral capital for an
Informal or formal conference at which
the peace terms may ba discussed. The
hint is discussed in this paragraph of
the central powers' reply:.
"It (the imperial government) begs.
therefore, in the sense of the declara
tion made on December l. which of
fered a hand for peace negotiations
to propose an Immediate meeting of
delegates of the belligerent states at
a neutral place."
The centro powers are opposed to
mediation. t was made clear a
few days ago by Baton von Dam
Busche Maddobausen. the now under
secretary ftg foreign affairs, when in
a semi-offtOal Interview he stated that
the bringing about of peace was solely
the affair of the belligerents.
Information from an absolutely
trustworthy source indicates that
Spain is about to extend an invitation
for the holding Of a conference. It is
pointed out that the Spantsh govern
ment has deliberately held aloof from
all previous offloial and unomcial ex
clnges of views regarding the peace,
a Itlng a tangible suggestion from
either side. This is now offered in
todafs note from the central powers.

Germany, in Reply to U. S.,
Urges Imtnwelate Pariey.
(my the lutmatemmi New* Servies.)
Berlin (ub Sayville wireless), Dec. S.
-The repel of the German allies to the
note of President Wilson was
tedhy. It failed to name any peace
terms
The reply states that the imperial gco
ernment considered President Wilson's
note in a friendly manner. but that "In
the opinion of the German government.
that great work-the prevention of future
warm -ca be begun only after the end
of the present struggle."
When the time comes. says the answer,
the German government will be ready
with pleasure to collaborate with the
United States.
The reply renews the offer made by
Chancellor von bethmann-Hollweg on
December 13 to enter Immediately into
a peace conference.
Thi text of the answer follows:
"The high-minded suggestion made by
the Presdmnt of the United states of,
America in order to create a basis for
the establishment of a lasting peace has
been received and considered by the im
perial government in the friendly spirit
.xpressed in the President'a commmca
lion.
"The President points Out that which
he has at heart and leaves open the
choice oCt the road.
"To the Imperial government an imme
iate exchange of views seems the moat
appropriate road 3m order to reach the
desired result.
"It therefore bega, in the sense of the
declaration made on December 12, which
offered the hand for peace negotiations,
to propose immediately a meeting of the
belligerent states at some neutral place.
"Also, the imperial government is of
the opinion that the great work of pre
vention of future wars can be begun
only after the present struggle of nations.
ft will, when this moment shall have
Dome. be ready with pleasure to collabo
rate entirely with the United States at
this exalted task."
BRITISH MINISTERS
TO DISCUSS PEACE,
Colonial Premiers Receive Call for
Big Conference.
(By the Intermatiteal News serviee.)
London. Dec. 26.-England Is ready
to discuss peace terms-with its Co
lonial prime ministers.
The first ray of hope that Great
Britain will not flatly turn down the
3erman proposal of peace came today
In the form of as oicial announoe
ment that some time in the immediate
lNture, not later than February 1. the
war council will hold conferences to
which. in the language of the ofIial
statement. "the prime ,ninister of each
dominion Is invited to consider ur
gent questions affecting the proeecu
tion of the war and the possible con
dittons on which, in agreement with
our allies, we would assent to its ter
mination."
The statement adds: "Other prob
Iems would then iftmediately arise."
It was further ofitially explained that
the meeting of the war cabinet, which
Premier Lloyd George announced the
other day, will be a "spewial war confer
oen of the whole empire."
In well-informed quarters it was wag
ested that this announcement is eleely
connected with the German peace note
of December -12; In other words, that
Britain may use this an the most
fale way to -a direct answer to
the central power' offer without apa,
Ing in the light of deliberatly and stub
bornly continuing the war egrdts.. of
what her enemles may have to propoe
It is further 8uggeetid that Ifgland
may now quite properly war to
the central powers thr United
states that no action an taken until
the prisme ndnntrg of the BriM col
onie, have been consulted on the eubject.
The a-nuncmet which puts tis end
