Tuesday, though the particulars hav
not yt been received her, Super
vlior Macduff, of tho 8lsklou forest,
received despatch from Ranger R.
I. Hilm, at Agness, this morning,
In which h reported that "Rllea had

there Is a heavy snow UV and In
severe storms. He was traveling

left West Fork expected to reach
Marlnl without difficulty before night
The psTty that found him left Mar-
11 Tuesday morning, and as It did

It Is evident that It must have gone

there Is now a great depth of snow.
Nothing was said In the telegram
concerning Commodore Fleming, sup
posedly lost la the some country, and
the forestry officials here are Inclin
