MAY ADDTO NOTE
Germany May Stipulate Full
Terms Thru Gerard.
Sealed Proposals Received at
Rome Arouse Interest.
Washington. Dec. 27. The view
persisted in Teutonic quarters that
Germany's replv would be followed
by u highly confidential oral or writ
ten communication concerning the
terms upon which the central powers
are willing to make pence. The Ger
man embassy, which repeatedly has
made it clear that the central powers
wre not likely to make public their
terms, had received no official ad
vices from Kerlin today, but definite
Information regarding the intentions
of the Teutonic allies was expected.
Lacking official advices. Teutonic
diplomats were unable to throw much
1 it Ht upon the manner in which terms
mii-'ht be confidentially appended to
the note given out in P.erlin. It was
regarded as probable that they might
be conveyed to 1'resident Vilson thru
Gerard. Ml such event even the fact
that they had been stated would not
be disclosed.
Kepoits repeated in press dispatches
from Home that Germany had pre
sented to the neutral nations whose
services idle asked in forwarding peace
suggestions, sealed packets containing
tcrmy were the subject of much com
ment in diplomatic quarters. 1 he
Koine report had it that the packets
were not to be opened and forwarded
to Germany's enemies unless they in
reply to the notes of the central pow
ers of December 12 specifically re
quested terms.
In German circles here it was con
id red more probable that direct in
fornia;ion on the subject would he
conveyed personally to President Wil
son thru A m bas.-jjidor Gerard.
Some officials pointed out that the
I'nlted States could do nothing fur
ther and could not decide on a course
until the entente allies also have re
plied to the note. Their answer has
been forecast by entente diplomats
here as a courteous recognition of the
president's purposes and ideals, but
probably a firm refusal to enter into
conference without having the terms
advanced first.
officials acknowledged their disap
pointment over Germany's failure to
reply directly to the president's sug
geslion that terms be laid down, but
ti i re inclined to hold to the view that
the door to negotiations must neces
sarily remain open until the allies
themselves .close it.
There was a carefully studied atti
tude regarding making any statement
that might be taken as official and an
Inclination to view the situation as
hopefully as possible

Little Rock, Dec. 27. Reports at
noon in Little Rock from storm areas
gathered by round-about communica
tion disclosed that twelve persons are
known to be dead and twenty-three
injured in the storm that swept over
central Arkansas late yesterday. Wires
are down in all directions where the
storm struck and it is only where
couriers have reached the passenger
stations that accurate information of
the extent of damage can be gained.
Three IJttlc Girls Killed.
Three little girls were killed and
four persons were injured when the
I tornado hit the W. S. Snow plantation
near Carlisle. These were the Padgett
and Snow children killed, and Mr. and
Mrs. Padgett and Mr. and Mrs. Snow
injured. All the Injured are expected
to recover.
The Padgett home on the Snow
plantation was demolished and the.
Snow home was damaged seriously.
Francis Snow and the little Padgett
girls were in the Padgett home when
the tornado struck.
A tremendous downpour of water
and a high, wind accompanied the
storm and railroads today are facing
washoutsr""high water, torn up tele
graph and telephone lines, making op
erations perilous. No trains have ar
rived in. this city today from Pine
Bluff, just south of the stricken area.
At Leola. Charles Stevens, a butcher,
was telephoning in a store when the
line was struck by lightning. Stev

three of the storekeeper's children and
another child in the store were
stunned by the bolt.
Hospitals CrowdeXl. .
For a hundred miles from Grant
county over portions of Pulaski,
Loneoke, Jefferson and Prairie coun
ties, the tornado took toll of lives and
stock. Estimates of the property
damage today were impossible. It is
conservatively placed near $3,000,000
tho it is certain that complete reports
will augment this amount. The list
of injured may reach fifty it was
thought here. A score of victims were
taken to Pine Bluff and placed in hos
pitals there. The suffering of many
left injured thru the night on the
plantations and farm houses between
the little country towns was acute.
Without medical attention, shelter or
fire and suffering from iniuries. the
cold rain added further to their mis
! ery. The serious condition of many
' of the victims today was assigned to
! the exposure of the night.
The Pilkington plantation six miles
north of Pine Bluff, was severely rav
ished by the gale. The home, all farm
buildings, barns and cotton gins were
wrecked, the cattle and stock killed
and the negro cabins razed. The dam
age on this plantation, one of the fin
est in the heart of the state's greatest
cotton producing area, was said to
day to be a quarter 'of a million dol
lars. Relief crews were sent out from
Pine Bluff and searched the stricken
area. Many of the injured now in Pine
Bluff wete brought back by the scouts
who took up their rescue work this
morning.
Fear for Convict Farm.
Much apprehension was felt here to
day regarding the fate of the state
convict farm at Tucker, southeast oi
here, where 325 prisoners were sta
tioned. The farm was believed to
have been directly in the storm's path
and, as all wire connection with it was
lost when the tornado first descended,
it was feared some of the convicts
have escaped during the confusion.
Capt. J. K. Burkett, warden of the
state penitentiary here, left last night
for the farm with a strong detachment
of guardsC
Passengers arriving here today
brought further reports of the wiping
out of a negro settlement at Keo be
tween here and Tucker, with a loss of
seventeen lives. Accurate informa
tion on the situation there, however is
lacking. '
The tornado swept to earth a few
miles north of Pine Bluff and cutting
a path four miles wide, assumed a
northeasterly course, iinally wearing
itself out in the vicinity of Duvalls
Bluff and Des Arc. Many homes were
set on fire by the lightning which at
tended the storm with great violence.

Secretary Lansing said In response
to questions today that such a note

and he had no knowledge of its hav

ceived here said the note had already
been delivered in some of the bellig

expression of endorsement of President
Wilson's note.
There were no indications to show
what Sweden intends doing:.
Washington, Dec. 27. Official In
formation has been received here that
Sweden has addressed a peace note to
the belligerents and sent copies to
neutrals urging consideration terms
of peace.
Berne, Dec. 27. The Tageblatt an
nounces that the Swedish diplomatic
representatives have handed to both
belligerents and neutrals a note in
spite of those of President Wilson and
the Swiss government.
The London Daily Telegraph stated
this morning that it understood that
the Swedish government had sent a
note to the belligerent nations similar
to that dispatched by Switzerland.
Calls Province Premiers.
London, Dec. 27. Lloyd-George's
plans for concentration and consecra
tion of all England's efforts for war
meanwhile are continuing. The usual
Christmas holidays taken by members
of the ministry, were overlooked by
the. Lloyd-George cabinet. Pursuant to
the promise made in his speech in
commons., outlining tlM -aims -of the
new government on December 19, f.te
premier has Issued a call, thru the sec
retary of state for the colonies, for a
conference of the premiers of British
dominions. This will be held at the
earliest practicable moment
In his recent speech Lloyd-George
said the premiers would be summoned
to take counsel with them as to what
further action we can take together
in order to achieve an early and com
plete triumph for the ideals which
they share with us." "
Kditoriul Comment Unanimous.
Editorial comment on the German
reply today was unanimous in regard
ing its phases as evasive.
Germany has countered with this
proposal so she can evade an explicft
answer." said the Daily MaiL
The Pall Mall Gazette says: "
"Germany has not been slow to seize
the advantage given her by President
Wilson's maladroit diplomacy. It
would be a real triumph for Germany
to have htrself recognized as the wire
less puller cf the power whose sub
jects her submarines drowned with
impunity and which lectured her in
the- name of all the cardinal virtues.
It would teach the world that by let
ting the Americans do the talking,
Germany understands how to get her
own way eventually inthe sphere of
practical ' politics.
Demands Withdrawal by Wilson.
"The studied impartiality f the
American note supplies Germany with
a coat of whitewash of which she was
badly In need. Germany proposes an
immediate conference . of belligerents
which appears to her to be the most
promising way of promoting a fissure
in the entente.
The allies have only one possible
attitude towards this, namely: They
will hold no discussion with an un
punished criminal or with a power
whose most solemn engagements are
mere scraps of paper. If Mr. Wilson's
real object was to 'elicit a plain state
ment of the aims and terms of both
side, Berlin's answer shows that he.
failed.
"It did not rjequire a note to procure
a plain statement of the allied cause.
Upon the German sid? the invitation
meets with summary dismissal. The
ill-conceived note has been frustrated
and thje most dignixied course now
would be its frank withdrawal."

will be established by the federal gov
ernment. Among them is Wichita,
Kan. "
The contest for a farm loan bank in
Kansas centered between Wichita and
Hutchinson. A few days ago the press
dispatches mentioned Hutchinson as
one of the cities being favorably con
sidered, but the list was not reported
officially. Wichita was not mentioned
in that list, so the appointment makes
Wichita a "black horse" in the win
ning. The list of cities officially given outy
today follow: '
Springfield. Mass.; Baltimore. Md.;'

District 10: Texas.
District 11: California, Nevada,
Utah and Arizona.
District 12: Washington, Oregon,
Montana and Idaho.
"In determining the federal land
bank districts and in designating the
cities within such districts where fed
eral land banks shall be located," the
official announcement says, "the fed
eral farm loan board has given care
ful consideration to the farm loan
needs of the country. The board held
public hearings in nearly every state
in the Union and in this manner col
lected information of great value in
determining its decision.
"Every reasonable opportunity has
been afforded applicant cities to fur
nish evidence to support their claims
as to locations of federal land banks.
More than seventy-five cities applied
to be designated as the headquarters
of a bank and were heard thru repre
sentative committees and individuals."
The banks will be established as
soon as practicable. Under the law
each will have a capital of 750.000.

While the idea of obtaining peace
is uppermost in administration minds,
there is among the inner circle a pro

is .inevitable if present peace proposal's
fail utterly.

In fact, one of the highest officials
stated today that present plans call
for no more note writing to Germany.
He added, if the Marina, Arabia and
other cases develop clear cut violation
of German pledges in the Sussex case,
or if Germany starts a new submarine
campaign in case peace fails, then a
break in relations Can be the only
answer.
