U. S. MAY BREAK

PEACE PLAN FAILS
By Robert J. Bender
WASHINGTON, I)ec. 27.—Despite a general 1 ecl
ing lit hopelessness among government heads over
prospects tor peace, in the light of Germany's latest
note, men close to President Wilson believed today he
will strive to the utmost to prevent the situation get
ting beyond his grasp.
Two reasons they sa> will actuate him, namely:
A desire to end the war and a desire, it possible,
to avoid having to put thru his Sussex note threat to
break relations with Germany should she overstep her
submarine pledges. ,
Officials made no secret of their pessimism over the
allied rejection of the German proposal for a round
