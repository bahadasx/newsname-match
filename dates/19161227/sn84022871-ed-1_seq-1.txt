IMPRESSIONS OF "BILLY"
SUNDAY AND HIS WORK.
Uevrh' i; ?4dwards of Newport
V rites Monitor of His Visit to
the Tabernacle and His Im
pressions of the Evangelist,
Some eight years ago while I was
pastor m Cleveland, there was a
movement launched that gained con
siderable momentum, to bring Mr.
Sunday to that city. He was then
engaged in a campaign in Youngs
town, Ohio. I confess that I was
among those who did not look with
favor upon his comng. I have, how
ever, followed him during the years
since with an ever-increasing inter
est and when the opportunity to at
tend the meetings for a week at Bos
ton was afforded me, I gladly accept
ed it for I was anxious indeed to see
and hear this man before whom the
forces of evil stand aghast; concerning
whom Christian men and Christian
churches are at such variance; yet
around whom there gathers an ever
enlarging multitude of men and wom
en from every walk in life, who look
upon him as their Moses, who led
tnem out of their land of bondage.
Scepticism that took the form of
grave fears on the part of many a
pood churchman in Boston, was much
in evidence before the movement was
launched.
The wise ones shook their heads
and said, "He will never do here in
Boston," but he came, they saw and
heard and he conquered.
It may be of interest to know
something of the magnitude of the
movement. The tabernacle, which is
a low, brick-wall affair, covers about
four acres. The ground is the floor
and is covered with shavings. A hall
about 15 feet wide surrounds the
auditorium. The choir loft, that is
built on an incline, is back of the
speaker's desk and will accommodate
2500 or more. The wooden benches
in the auditorium and chairs in choir

President Thomas on jChaplain Far
mans Lecture before Mid
lebury College.
Chaplain M. W. Farman gave his
lecture on "Light in Darkness" in the
Mead chapel at Middlebury col-
pt-in re evening of Dec. 8th.
President Thomas says:
4 J'MrFanJia? ,was heard with keen
interest and delight by the faculty
and students of Middlebury college.
Both m his eloquent description of
the limitations of the blind and in his
narrative of the manner in which
these are so largely overcome he was
followed with close attention. His
lecture was full of instruction. I
thought it one of the noblest lessons
in courage I have ever seen taught to
a body of young people. The ex
ample of a man fighting his way so
successfully through life despite his
severe handicap, is an inspiration.
At the same time his address was
well seasoned with wit and humor.
rom evry point of view his lecture
was a pronounced success. Mr Far
man was a delightful guest and any
community or home will be the hap
pier and the better for his coming."
Revvi -J-. Hutchinson's Opinion of
Chaplain Farman's Lecture.
After Chaplain Farman delivered
his lecture in Lyndonville, Rev. J. J.
Hutchinson said, "It was a great

This
An Old-Fashioned Blizzard.
The snow and wind storm of Fri
day night was a good old-fashioned
equinoctial blizzard such as our
grandfathers tell about. During the
day Friday and all Friday night the
snow fell and during the night Fri
day and much of the day Saturday
the wind blew a gale from the north
and northwest, pilincr the
: immense drifts which blockaded the
xnKuways Saturday and delayed
trains from one to six hours.
. Coming-as it did on the eleventh
hour for Christmas shopping, (the
hour when most people are prone to
shop) and at the very time the trains
were crowded with Christmas traffic,
the delays and blockades caused much
discomfiture. Rural Carriers White
and Jenness were both compelled to
abandon their routes on Saturday
is
w as i seen oy me to leave the building
without taking a look at the "blind
mans books." I heartily recommend
Mr. f arman as a pleasing and in
structive lecturer and also preacher."

Employes of Telephone Company Get
Bonuses.
i.Practically' a11 of the employes of
the Passumpsic Telephone company,
which is a subsidiary company of the
New England Telephone & Telegraph
company, and more than 13,000 em
ployes of that company,- will each
participate today in the distribution
of an emergency payment to assist
them in meeting unusual present ex
penses. Employes,, who have been in the
service one year or more will receive
three weeks' pay. Employes who have
been m the service less than one year
but not less than three months will
receive two weeks' pay. No employe
will receive more than $175, and no
employee of less than three months'
service and no general official will in
any way share in the payments.
While in no sense a holiday pres
ent, the fact that it comes most un
expectedly at this time in the year
makes it a most timely evidence of
the continued concern of the com
pany's officers for the welfare of its
employes. This distribution to the
employes of the Passumpsic Tele
phone company, which represents a
substantial sum of money, is in ac
cord with the distribution made to
the employes of the New England
lei. & Tel. Company amounting to
over $600,000.
In connection with the announce
ment of the payment to be made to
the employes of the New England
company, President Spalding of that
company is quoted as saying:
"We shall make the payments on
December 27th. They will represent
not charity, on the one hand nor a
raise of wages, on the other, but
ii i can reduce the idea to a
phrase, messages of goodwill, under
standing and appreciation on the
part of the officers of the company
fpr efficient and loyal employes in a
temporary time of stress."

I came with Space, and hand in hand,
We two sat here alone,
As two twin Kings of equal might
Sit side by side athrone.
While eons came, and eons went,
In ceaseless passing flight.
And all was still as dungeons deep,
And black as moonless night.
Then age by age a million, years
We watched the Sun take form,
While through the void in endless count,
The Stars were being born.
And then from out unfathomed Space,
We saw the world appear.
I shook my glass and from it fell,
A Sand of Time the first New Year.
The Years! I watched them come and go,
'Till I could count no more, -
The Old the New like falling rain,
Or sands upon a shore.
Through age of Mist, and age of storm, . !
And age of sweeping Flame,
Till last Man came with gift of speech,
And gave to me my Name.
Old Father Time, he calls me now,
As close I glean my tithe.
I walk the Earth with silent thread,
Yet ever sweep my Scythe.
Forever old, yet doomed to live,
I'd rest but none is here.
Again I raise my Glass and pour
Another Sand a new, New Year.
