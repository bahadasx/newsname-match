Inquiry instituted in. this city for

New HaVen police. . .
From the fact that Dr. John C.

similar ,pne reported to the New
Haven poh. as - that which; struck
Hewitt, but ih fact is an entirely dif
ferent type of automobile from that
whioh speeded away from the scene of
accident, it is believed in police circles
here that incorrect .description of the
motorist has bqen furnished " by wit
nesses. - .
Dr. Lynch, who was questioned yes
terday about the accident at once fur
nished proof that he was In' no way
responsible and the fact that his car
was not a Ford, which all witnesses
agree was the make of the one sought
absolves him from any connection
with the case. '
' City-wide search is still being con
ducted here "for those responsible and
believed to be in hiding here. .The

Taylor " grabbed hold and asked a

Unfriendly Relations Caused
Husband to "Conceal"
Wealth, She Claims.
Frances Heleene , Heft; of East
Mauoh Chunk, Pai, the first wife of
the late Col. Nathan H. Heft, today
began her second suit to have her
allowance from the estate increased.
When she obtained her divorce, the
plaintiff received $20,000. She claims
that Col- Heft at that time "made
false and fraudulent representa
tions" as to the amount of his es
tate. .She asks that her allowance
be increased to $300,)00.
City Sheriff Antonio Abriola today
served papers on Mrs. Mary Joseph
ine, the colonel's widow, who is ad
ministratrix of "the estate. Service
will also be made on George S. Heft,
of New York, son of Col. Heft, ad
ministrator. Copy of writ and com
plaint was also , left with Judged Paul
L. Miller, of the probate court.
The complaint recites that in Sep
tember, 1902., the plaintiff brought di
vorce proceedings against Col. Heft.
For some time p'rior to that date ..' un
friendly feelings" between the plain
tiff and Col Heft caused him to "con
ceal" frotff her the amount of his es
tate, it is claimed.
During the, divorce trial, the com
plaint . further' states, Col. Heft "per
sonally and .through his counsel made
false and fraudutent representations
of the amount of' his estate. These
representations, it is claimed, made it
appear that his estate amounted to
$100,000.'
": In,.' awarding the decree of divorce,
on January 10, 1903, the court. ordereM
that the plaintiff receive $20,000 as
her. share of the estate. .
When the estate of Col. Heft -was
inventoried f in July; 1915, it was val
ued at $300,000. , : The plaintiff says
tnat the. estate, personal and real,to
tals about $900, 000;.,and .asks that the
former judgment - and decree be
changed, and that she be given $500,
000 as her share of the estate.

Capital Awaiting
: v Official Text of
Germany's Answer
.Washington, Dec. 27 Germany's
reply to President Wilson's peace note
had hot been received here, in ofllcial
form early today and officials were
reserving' their comment until they
had opportunity to study it. " ' -
Despite ' the : disappointment be
cause Germany has not acceded to
the President's suggestion and laid
down her terms, the ' general view
prevailed that the reply was another
step forward in the peace movement,
because it left room for' subsequent
negotiations. ' ' ;
The United States undoubtedly is
expecting Germany to transmit the.
sense of her reply to the entente bel
ligerents, and the -immediate outcome
depends upon-whether the allies will
modify their determination not to
enter a conference before terms, have
beeft laid down. . It was pointed out
that the way had not been closed for
Germany to lay down terms, a the
allies demand. In a diplomatic fiego
tlation of such magnitude and scope
officials do not look for results to be
immediately apparent but expect the
way to be paved carefully and slowly.
The next move will not be determined
until after the official text of the re
ply, has. been received and carefully
considered. v
Some officials pointefl out that the
United States could do - notning
further and could not decide on , a
course until the, entente allia also
have replied to the note. Their
answer has been forecasted, by en
tente diplomats here as a. courteous
recognition of the Presidents pur
poses and. Ideals but probably a firm
refusal to enter into conference with
out having terms advanced first.
Officials acknowledged their disap-
peintinent over Germany's failure to
reply directly to the President's sug
gestion that terms be laid down but
were inclined to hold to the view that
the door to negotiations must reces
sairly remain open until . the allies
themselves close it.
President Wilson -will, discuss vit
thoroughly with the cabinet, probably
Friday.
Germany Too. Eager
For Peace, London
Newspapers Assert
4 -
London, Dec. 27 The promptness
of the German government's reply te
President Wilson's note is character
ized by the evening newspapers today
as evidence of Germany's eagerness
to bring the war to an end. The
Standard feays:
"it would be a mistake to neglect
the German political maneuvers but
would be even more fatal to waste
time over them. We trust the gov
ernment will give President Wilson a
perfectly courteous reply and then get
on with the war as energetically as
possible." - ,

"Germany has not been slow to
seize the advantages ; given her by
President' Wilson's jnaladroit diplo
macy, "f I twould 'be a real triumph
for Germany -to nave herself recog
nized as the wirepuller of the powers
whose subjects her submarines drown
ed with Impunity and which lectured
her 'in the nature of all ' cardinal vir
tues.! It- would teach the world that
by letting the Americans do the talk
ing Germany understands how to get
her way eventually In the sphere of
practical' politics. " ' ' ' ' ' ' ' "
- "The studied impartiality of the
American note supplies Germany,, with
a coat of whitewash of which she was"
badly- In need , Germany pro-
poses an immediate conference of bel-llgerents--which
appears to her to -be
the most promising way" of promoting
a fissure in the entente." The allies
have only one-possible attitude to this,
namely, they win hold no discussion
with an unpunished criminal or with
a power whose most" solemn engage
ments are mere, scraps of paper. . . If
Mr.j Wilson's real object- was to elicit
a plain statement ' of , the alms and
terms of both sides, Berlin's answer
shows that he failed. .,.,.. .
St did not require a note to pro
cure a plain statement of the allied
cause. Upon the German side the
invitation meets wlti summary; dis
missal. .The ill-concealed note has
been frustrate'd and: the most dignified
course now would be Its frank-withdrawal."
