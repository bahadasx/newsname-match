Cooper, an agod farmer of Tappun*
Taylor county, a small village a fo\v
miles from Boothsvillo, was Instantly
killed about 3 o'clock Tuesday afternoon,
when he was struck and run
over by a double-header freight train
on tho Baltimore and Ohio railroad,
bound east. Tho aocidont occurred
at the railroad crossing at Watson, ,a
point where many similar accldonts
have occurred in tho past.
Mr. Cooper was riding a black colt
when ho met death. He had brought
a cow to tho Fairmont market and
disposed of it hero. Tho cow was
sold to a local butcher, and with tho
proceeds of tho salo in Ms pocket the
farmer started homo.
As ho approached the Tallroad
crossing tho colt became nervous. A
long freight train, drawn by two en
glnes proceeding up tho rivor.
and Mr. Coopor reined In bis hora^.
But when about 4 00 feet from the
crossing the horse became unmanageable
and started running out the
road. Just before reaching tho crossing
the horse tried to stop and his
hoofs slid nlong tho concrete road
making marks In the concrete plainly
visible an hour after the accident.
Just as tho horse reached the edge of
i the track It stopped, and Mr. Cooper
i was hurled over Its hand onto tho
trnck and directly In front of the en
glnes. The two engines and about
- nine cars passed over his body before
, the train could be-stopped and he was
, horribly mutilated. The body was
picked up and sent to the Fairmont
I hospital In tills city. Later It wrs
removed to the Musgrave undertaking
rooms and prepared for burial.
The dolt continued to run^up the
railroad track'ln front of tho engine
for 300 or 400 feet and then stopped.

driving the cow on to Fairmont. After
the deal here was concluded,
Cooper asked Sypoult to ride back to
Watson with hini on the horse. The
boy declined and rode back on a
street car. To his decision to ride on
the car ho probably owes his life.
