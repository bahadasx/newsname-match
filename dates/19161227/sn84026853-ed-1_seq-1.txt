Totall,oss By
Fire Saturday
The friends of Mr. Pat H. McCaslan
will regret to know that
he had the misfortune to lose his
home on last Saturday morning,
when it was totally destroyed by fire.
One end of the building was in
flames when a tenant on the place
discovered the fire. He hurried to
the house and found the room of Mr
McCaslan full of smoke and its occupant
sound asleep. With a good
deal of difficulty he succeeded in getting:
Mr. McCaslan out before the
building fell in.
The entire house and its contents
are a complete loss. Mr. McCaslan
did not have time to save even a
suit of clothes. He borrowed a suit
from his friend, Jno. Boggs Kennedy
and came to town in the morning
and bought a full wardrobe. ,He lost
in addition all his Christmas money,
which was in his purse in his pants'
pockets. It is not known just how
the fire originated. v

Systematic Plan
' for Big Stealing
The Dargan-King Company has
been doing a big business as a retail
dealer in hardware, cutlery, silverware,
aluminum ware and Christmas
goods, but the money did not
come in in this way fast enough for
Horace McKnight, the colored gentleman
who has been (leaning up thd*

Conference on the subjcct,

Jim Belcher. Horace was able to
sell much cheaper than Mr. Dargan
because Mr: Dargan not only paid
for what he sold himself but for
what Horace was selling also.
The result is that Horace is facing
a 'good many charges of larceny,
while the other culprits have been
convicted in the Mayor's court of receiving
stolen goods. As stated in
another column, Gilliard contributed
[ $75.00 to the city treasury. This
morning the mayor assessed Robert
E. Wilson $75.00 and George Pressjley
$50.00, they having demanded a
jury trial and having been convicted.
Wheeler Thomson, of carpenter
fame, took his straight from the
Mayor and received a. permit co
make a contribution of $25.00, which
was also -satisfactory to Mazy Watt

to show that "the way of the traiiDgressor

SAYS NOTE IS
: THAN A "FEELER"
Washington Watches for News as
to How Wilson's Note , is Received
Abroad.
Washington, Dec. 23.?With the
purposes of President Wilson's note
to* belligerents clarified by official
statements on the subject, the attention
of the United States as turned
to the reception of the notp, in
the foreign capitals.
Diplomats here are eagerly watching
for indications of whether ' the
European neutrals will follow the
lead of the United States and make
a similar appeal the warring powers.
There is jjrowing feeling that the
United States hopes to become the
clearing house for views and possibly
for terms of the belligerents.
Several of the diplomats have advised
their governments to that ef
feet in order to guide them in their
replies.
No Mer^ Feclef.
Surprise at the fast growing significance
of the president's move was
expressed on all sides, where it was
pointed outthat at first the opinion
prevailed that the note itself was
merely a /'feeler" and that the most
immediately in issuing it was tin
receipt of some sort of definition
from the warning nations.
That the president shold let it be
knowin indirectly to the diplomats,
for their guidance, that he went even
farther than that and counted on an
absolutely frank reply from the belligerents,
which would lead to an
actual opportunity for negotiations,
proved only less surprising than the
note itself.
Gradual clarification among the
entente diplomats were of the president's
purpose and indications that
they would advise their governments
to reply in a friendly spirit proved a
source of deep gratification today as
it was pointed out both in. the note
itself and by -Secretary Lansing that
one 6f the dangers was that the allies
would consider the step as a
pro-German move.
the^iurte ai^fcH)eca^e it ss$
the objects or the belligerents were
practically the same was not unexpected
here,'where attention already
has been drawn to the fact that Pre*
ident Wilson specifically declared
that the published views of the opnnoincp
nfnfoamen l?f+. that imnrflR.
sion.
It is stated ^officially that the presiident
would not presume to say that
two groups were fighting for the same
object, but merely that their official
spokesman had outlined much the
same general program without going
into the actual details which he now
seeks.
