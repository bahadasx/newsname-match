trality pact being consummate be
tween the Scandinavian countries and
the meeting of three kings of Swed
en, Norway and Denmark at Malmo.
One remarkable feature will show
the great "Bondetaget" of 1914, when
forty-thousand citizens from every
province of Sweden went to Stock
holm to petition the king to demand
more preparations for the defense of
the fatherland This was six months
before the great world war broke out,
and certainly was a remarkable pie
tnonitorj smptom. This film shows
King Gustav and Prins Carl, as well
as others addressing the large throng
at the palace
The pictures include winter and
summer sports, educational, agricul
tural, military, industrial (which in
cludes views of the greatest electric
power plant in Europe) and scenic
features too numerous to be enumer
ated here
These pictures will be of absorbing
interest to everyone, but especially to
Scandinavians and their descendants.
Judging by the inquiries the Willmar
Tribune has received since it was an
nounced that the Swedish Society had
made application for the appearance
ot the pictures at Willmar, we judge
that the Opera House will be well fill
ed at each performance. The Swed
ish newspapers of this country have
given extensive publicity in regard to
them

that "These films are splendid and it

MRS. C. E. LIEN.
The sad news was received by
Willmar friends of the death of Mrs.
C. E. Lien, an old-time resident of this
city, which occurred at Grove City
last Friday, Dec. 22, after a lingering
illness. She attained the age of 74
years and three months, and leaves to
mourn her death, the husband, Judge
C. E. Lien, two brothers, John Even
son of Madison and Andrew Evenson
of Greenleaf township, and a number
of other relatives.
The funeral occurred this morning
at Grove City. At ten o'clock Rev.
Weeks of Grove City spoke briefly at
the residence. Rev. J. N. Andersen
of Willmar later delivered the funeral
sermon at the Synod church and of
ficiated at the cemetery. The pall
bearers were John Evenson, the bro
ther of the deceased, his son, George
Evenson, three other nephews, Elmer,
Nels and Carl Evenson and O. A.
Graugaard.
Those attending the obsequies from
Willmar were Messrs. A. E. Rice, O.
A. Grangaard, G. E. Qvale, F. G. Han
dy, W. F. Gratz, M. Jorgenson, I. C.
Olson and Mesdames Peter Bonde, J.
H. Olsen, Gramhill and Miss Clara
Jacobson.
Mrs. Bertha Lien was born at Mo
dum, Norway, Sept. 22, 1842. She
came with her parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Hans Evenson, to the Minnesota fron
tier and they located on a claim not
far from the present city of Litch
field in the year 1860. In the late six
ties she married Christen E. Lien,
then a prominent settler at Norway
Lake, where he had located on a
homestead claim on the farm later ac
quired by Mr. Skaalerud. Mr. Lien
became register of deeds in the Mon
ongalia organization when the county
seat was located at New London.
About 1876 the Liens moved to Will
mar and built a residence in First
Ward in 1877. Mr. Lien served as
Judge of Probate 1879-'86. They con
tinued as residents of Willmar for
about thirty-six years until two years
ago when they moved to Grove City.
The late Mrs. Lien was a devoted
member of the Norwegian Lutheran
Synod church at Willmar during her
residence here and took an active
part in the church work. She was
treasurer of the Mission Society for
many years. Her death causes much
regret in the circle of old friends at
Willmar, and the surviving husband
has the heartfelt sympathy of all in
the loss of his life companion.
Special Meetings at First Mi E.
There will be a week of special
meetings at the First Methodist
church beginning January 15th and
closing Sunday the 21st.
These meetings will be in charge of
Evangelist Morris C. Johnson, who
will speak in English each evening
but will conduct some afternoon meet
ings in the Scandinavian language.
See next week's paper for further an
nouncements in regard of these meet
ings.
