! Germany Prepares to Send Peace I
Envoys to Hague for Conference
5 i 7
j Sweden Has Addressed - r
Peace Note to Warring
1 Nations and to Neutrals
j Great Britain and Allies Await Concerted Action of Entente Before Acting
j on American and Swiss ProposalsGermany May Send Strictly Con
j fidential Note to United States, Expressing Terms on Which
j a Conference May Be Based.
London, Dec. 27, 11 a. m. A dispatch from The Hague
to the Exchange Telegraph compan' says German agents have
arrived at The Hague to make preliminar' arrangements for
German delegates to the peace conference suggested in the
j German reply to President Wilson's note.
The dispatch follows:
"In view of the preparatory meeting of delegates to a
peace conference suggested in the German reply to President
h Wilson, German agents have arrived at The Hague and are
5 making inquiries for hotel accommodations for German dele
I gates."
Washington, Dec. 27. Official infor-
m mation has been received here that
K Sweden had addressed the peace note
B to the belligerents and sent copies to
E neutrals urging consideration of terms
In for peace.
KS Secretary Lansing said in response
to questions today that such a note
If reached the state department and he
m-had no knowledge, of-its.. haying been
IBji dispatched.
The advices received here said the
l note had already been delivered in
If? some of the belligerent capitals and
I Iff that it much resembled the Swiss
I note which was an expression of en-'
II dorsement of President Wilson's note.
l There were no indications to show
l what Spain intends doing.
I Washington, Dec. 27 Germany's re-
Ply to President Wilson's peace note
had not been received here in official
form early today and officials were
II reserving their comment until they
If had opportunity to study IL
Kg Despite the disappointment because
II Germany has not acceded to the pres
II ident's suggestion and laid down her
M terms, the general view prevailed that
t the reply was another step forward in
If the peace movement because it left
1 room for subsequent negotiations.
The United States undoubtedly Is
expected by Germany to transmit the
j sense of her reply to the entente hel
ps ligerents and the immediate outcome
If depends upon whether the allies will
K modify their determination not to en-
II ter a conference before terms have
P been laid down. It was pointed out
P that the way had not been closed for
I Germany to lay down terms as the
I! allies demand. In a diplomatic nego
11$ tiation of such magnitude and scope
R officials do not look for results to be
f immediately apparent, but expect the
5 way to be paved careful and slowly.
III The next move will not be determined
H until after the official -text of the reply
hai; been carefully considered. Presl
K dnl Wilson will discuss it thoroughly
3 with the cabinet, probably Friday.
-5 Somo officials pointed out that the
United States could do nothing fur
1 ther and could not decide on a course
lfe until the entente allies have also re
fa plied to the note. Their answer has
K been forecast by entente diplomats
li here as a courteous recognition- of the
a president's purposes and ideals but
IP Probably a firm refusal to enter into
II conference without having terms ad
If) vanced first. .
HI Officials acknowledged their disap-
III pointment over Germany's failure to
! reply directly to -the president's sug
II! Eestion that terms bo laid down but
were inclined to hold to the view
pi that the door to negotiations must
ft necessarily remain open until the al
ll lies themselves close IL There was a
.' carefully studied attitude of refusing
If to make any statement that might be
h considered official and an ovldent in
f, cllnation to view the situation as
HI hopefully as possible.
IK Central Powers May Offer Terms.
IP The view persisted in Teutonic quar
i ters that Geramny's reply would be
i followed by a highly confidential oral
i or -written communication concerning
, IP the terms upon which the Central
1 p Powers are willing to make peace.
, ! If The German embassy, which repeated
1 If ly has made it clear that the Central
If Powers were not llkly to make public
p their terms, had received no official
II advices from Berlin today, but defin
p He information regarding the inten
p Hons of the Teutonic allies were ex
II' Pected
p Lacking official advices Teutonic
; diplomats vere unable to throw much
If light upon the manner In which terms
If might be confidentially appended to
r lhe note given out in Berlin. It was
I) regarded a8 probable that they might
ft, bo conveyed to President Wilson
I : through Ambassador Gerard. In such
-. event, even the fact that they had
8 1 been stated, would not be disclosed.
$ . Reports repeated in press dos-
1 M
patches from Rome that Germany had
, presented to the neutral nations
whose services she asked in forward
ing peace suggestions, sealed packets
containing terms were the subject o
much comment in diplomatic quarters.
The Rome report had it that packets
wer not to be oponed and forwarded
to Germany's enemies unless they,
in reply to .the notes of the' Central
Powers of December 12, specifically
requested terms. In German circles1
here it was considered more probable
that direct information on the subject
would be conveyed personalis' to
'President Wilson through Arnbassa
dor Gerard.
It is unlikely that any steps will be
taken by Great Britain and the other
countries of the entente with regard
to President Wilson's note and its
Swiss counter part until the entente
allies have dealt with the proposals.
It is understood here that the reply
does not give specific terms, but refers
generally to the objects of the allies.
Those participating in the discussion
speak of the difficulty of expressing
the main purposes In concrete form so
that the reply may be definitely re
sponsive and at the same time convey
neutral countries an adequate idea of
the aims and purposes for which the
entente allies are contending.
' The reason for not stating the spe-
Arin tor-mo ic cnM hnrp tn ho flint thfl
terms of the allies largely depend upon
the extent of the military victory
which they confidently expected and
any statement of terms should be
forthcoming from the German chancel
lor, Von Bethmann-Hollweg. It Is held
that Germany Is in a position to state
her terms whereas the entente terms
become definite when military suc
cesses have been achieved.
Berne, via Paris, Dec. 27, 4:50 a. m.
The Tageblatt announces that the
Swedish diplomatic representatives
have handed to both belligerents and
neutrals a note In support of thoseof
President Wilson and the Swiss gov
ernment. The London Daily Telegraph stated
this morning that it understood that
the Swedish government had sent a
note to the belligerent nations similar
to that dispatched by Switzerland.

BRITISH COMMENT
ON BERLIN REPLY
London, Dec. 27, 12:20 p. m. The
promptness of the German govern
ment's reply to President Wilsons
note is characterized by the Evening
news papers as evidence of Germany's
eagerness to bring the war to an end.
The Standard says:
"It would be a' mistake to neglect
the German peace maneuvers, but it
would be oven more fatal to waste
time over them. We tniBt the gov
ernment will give President Wilson a
perfectly courteous, but also a definite
replv and then get on with the war
as energetically as possible."
The Pall Mall Gazette says:
"Germany has not been slow to
seize the advantage given her by Pres
ident Wilson's maladroit diplomacy.
It would be a real triumph for Ger
many to have herself recognized as
the wireless puller of the power
whose subjects her submarines drown
ed with Impunity and which lectured
her in the name of all of the cardi
nal virtues. It would teach the world
that let the Americans do the talking
but Germany understands how to get
her own way eventually in the sphere
of practical politics.
"The studied Impartiality of the
American note supplies Germany with
a coat of whitewash of which she
was. badly in need. Ger
many proposes an immediate confer
ence of belligerents which appears to
her to be the most promising way of
promoting a fissure in the entente.
The allies have only one possible at
titude to this; namely, they will hold
no discussion with an unpunished
criminal, or with a power whose most
solemn engagements are mere scraps
of paper. If Mr. Wilson's real object
was to elicit a plain statement of the
aims and terms of both sides, Ber
lin's answer shows that he failed.
"It does not require a note to pro
cure a plain statement of the allied
cause. Upon the German side the in
vitation meets with summary dismis
sal. The ill-conceived note has been
frustrated and the most dignified
course now would be its frank with
drawal." View of German Government.
The following is from the Westmin
ister Gazette:
"For two or three days the pre
tense" was1 kept up that the" American"
proposals were an unfriendly attempt
to snatch 'the prize of victory' from
the German peace but this clearly is
not at all the view of the German gov
ernment, which sees in it a welcome
opportunity to Improve the occasion
and at the same time press forward
its own proposal for stopping the war.
President Wilson is not to blame for
this and we should be very unwise to
rush to the conclusion that he ex
pected to receive this answer and was
to that extent playing into the hands
of the Germans."
Commenting on a Washington des
patch saying President Wilson was
inspired by the desire to give the bel
ligerents, especially Germany, a better
excuse for defining their conceptions
of a possible settlement and the Ger
man repb that an immediate ex
change of views was the most appro
priate road in order to reach the de
sired result, the Westminster Gazette
says :
No Suspension of Hostilities. j
"The German government can
scarcely be so naive as to suppose
the allied government would suspend
hostilities, or enter into a conference
with an enemy who has just pro
claimed himself the victor without
knowing, even through the usual in
direct channels, what he was going
to propose. It is Germany
who proposed the negotiations. It is
Germany who considers herself to be
in the superior position. It Is Germany
who wants to stop the war. There
fore, it must be for her, as the initiat
or of the preceedings to define in gen
eral terms the basis on which she
proposes to negotiate.
Many Misunderstanding.
"There apparently are many misun
derstanding here and in America
about President Wilson's Intentions
and that makes it the more important
that we should make our own position
plain. We hope, therefore, that our
reply to the American note will be a
careful and well reasoned statement
of the position, as we understand it,
and not a mere hasty dismissal of
the American note as if it were ultra
vires. The United States is deeply
concerned in the European struggle
and has a hundred I good reasons to
desire peace, but it should not be dif
ficult to make her see that a mere
patched-up truce would bo as little to
her interests as to ours."
Star Roasts Germany.
The Evening Star says:
"Germany has replied in hot haste.
She Is working the Wilson note for all
It is worth. She is trying to make
peace by wireless. The contrast be
tween her panting precipitancy and
the allies leisurely language is
great. ...
"There is grave, urgent need for
cool wisdom and brave leadership in
the circumstances, We note with
alarm the growing disposition In cer
tain quarters to mako bad blood be
tween the British and American peo
ple. That is playing the German game
and must be stopped dead. There must
be no mercy for lunatics who are ready
to poison Anglo-American relation
ships. Let us make a stand against the
colossal Inaptitude of misrepresenting
and misunderstanding President Wtt
son's note.

WINTER TORNADO
CAUSES DEATHS
Toll of Ten Gathered in Cen
tral Arkansas Scores of
Tragedies Reported.
DAMAGE TO PROPERTY
Fate of Prisoners at State Con
vict Farm Cause of Much
Apprehension.
Little Rock, Ark., Dec. 27. The
winter tornado which yesterday swept
through central Arkansas gathered
for its toll ten known deaths, at least
a score of seemingly well founded re
ports of tragedies and a property dam
age which yet is to be established
with resumption of wire communica
tion to the afflicted district.
The known dead:
Albert L. Swartz, a farmer living
near England.
Choice Padgett, ten years old.
Allalee Padgett,9 years old.
Frances Snow, 9 years old, all liv
ing near Carlisle.
Two negroes near Pine Bluff.
Two negroes near Sherrlll.
One negro near England.
Another death near Pine Bluff; not
known whether black or white.
Much apprehension was felt here
today regarding the fate of the state
convict farm at Tucker, southeast of
here, where 325 state prisoners were
stationed. The farm was believed to
have been directly in the storm's
path and as all wire connection with
it was lost when the tornado first de
scened, it was feared some of the
convicts might have escaped during
the confusion. Captain J. R. Burkett,
warden of the state penitentiary, left
here last night for the farm with a
strong detachment of guards.
Passengers arriving here today
brought further reports of the wiping
out of a negro settlement at Keo,
between here and Tucker, with a loss
of seventeen -lives. Accurate informa
tion on the situation there, however,
is lacking.
The tornado swept the earth a few
miles north of Pine Bluff and cutting
a path four miles wide, assumed a
northeasterly course and finally wore
out itself in the vicinity of Duval
Bluff and Des Arc. Many homes were
set afire by the lightning which at
tended the storm.

Hammering at Bridgehead. I
Berlin, Dec. 2, by wireless to Sayville. The five-day
battle that has been in progress in eastern Wallachia, has re
suited in the piercing of the Russian lines at several points,
army headquarters announced today. The Russians were (
definitely defeated on a iront of seventeen kilometers south
west of Rimnik-Sarat. Several fortified villages have been H
captured by the Teutonic Danube army and the Russians have H
jbeen forced to retreat to prepared positions further north. 1 H
"While the peace discussions are pro
ceeding, active military operations, ex
cept in such remote fields as those of
Egypt and the Tigris, are being vigor
ously prosecuted only on the Rumani
an front.
In this war area the latest reports
show Field Marshal von Mackensen
making new headway in his advance
itoward Braila, the great Rumanian
grain and oil storehouse on the lower
Danube.
The taking of Filipechti placed Von
Mackensen's forces little more than
thirty miles from this objective. On
the other side of the Danube, mean
while, the Teutonic Dobrudja army,
apparently comprising -chiefly Bulgari
an troops, Is hammering away at the
i bridgehead of Matchln, almost directly
opposite Braila. The clearing of the
remaining Rumanians from Dobrudja
' thus seems a possibility, not onlj' by
tho direct attack, but through the ad
vance in Wallachia, which, if It suc
ceeded in reaching Braila, would be
able to take the Matchln position un
der artillery fire in flank and rear
from across the Danube.
On the Franco-Belgian front the ar
tillery has been active in some sec
tors and the aviators have been busj
but the infantrjT army of the service
on both sides is being held well to its
i positions, except for occasional trench
raids "and patrol enterprises.

MINISTER OF WAR
Press and Public Unanimous
in Welcominfir Revival of
Dignity of Marshal.
Paris, Dec. 27, 4:45 a. m. In addi
tion to a decree creating General Jof
fro a marshal of France, President
Polncaro has'signed decrees dated De
'cember 2, 1916, and December 13. 191C.
"The first of these appointed Marshal
Joffre commander-in-chief of all the

onies and Morocco, the second said:
"General Joffre commander-in-chiof of
the French forces, will act.as technical
adviser to the government In all mat
ters concerning tho direction of the

The high command, as now settled
finally, consists of the war committee,
composed of Premier Briand; General
H. Lyautey, minister of war; Rear
.Admiral Lacaze, minister of marines;
J Albert Thomas, minister of national
manufactories, Alexandre Ribot, min
ister of finance, and President Poin
care. The duty of the minister of
war is to notify the other ministers
and commanding generals concerning
the decisions of the committee and '
take measures to insure their con
certed execution. In addition he is
responsible for everything concerning
the preparation and maintenance of
the nation's military resources.
There are two generals command
ing, General Nivelle of the armies of
the north and northeast who also as.
sures a liaison with the allied staffs;
and. General Sarrail, of the army of
the Orient who, as already announced
is no longer answerable to Briand's
