MEN IN HEALTHY CONDITION
Boyi WIU Setarn Hone la Body After
Wert: el Mastering Ont la Con*
*"a A healthy bronze colored squad of
sixteen members of Company, ar
rived In Manchester from Des Moines
on the early trains Sunday morning.
They bad Christmas dinner at home
and left Monday night to rejoin their
company at Fort Des Moines. The
boys appeared in the pink of condition
almost all of them having gained be
tween ten and twenty pounds in
weight during thdir service in camp.
They said they had been well cared
for and had been given good training
and a very valuable experience. The
process of mastering out the guard is
attended by the nsual or perhaps it
might be called unusual red tape.
The boys said they did not expect
far be mustered out until the last of
January.
Those who were at home on a
Christmas furlough were Ross Pheni
cie, Wayne Barker, John Anderson,
James Thomas, Fred Miller, Thos. D.
Wilson, Claude Gray, Burr Finch, F.
P. Walker, .Roy Welterlen, Arthur
Hutchinson, Ned Seeds, William Mat
thews, Tony and McKinley Powers,
Clinton Burch and John W. May.
F. P. .Walker, who is a m&£ber.of
the company and who spent Christmas
at home, has set out a few facts re
garding the experiences and the gen
eral condition of the boys, which out
readers will find of interest.
Mr. Walker Bays:
A Few Things of Interest to the
Hone Folks Concerning Co. H.-
I have been urged to jot down a few
things of community interest concern
ing the showing of Company on
the border. It is'always pleasant to
be able to say good things, thus I find
this little task. The company be
longs to the people of Delaware coun
ty,'add I wished* felve you a fair idea
of how it represented'you.
Captain Grossman is mighty proud
of the- compimjrli^lg'tifitijBfay^
and of the record jt made in the ser
vice." He has a right to be proud. His
two 'Mfeutenatttfri were the best in the
Iowa Brigade, Incidentally, that meanB
on the border. The men of his com-
down there. They could hike as far
and fight as much as any of them.
Throughout the First regiment, they
were known as "those hard boiled
men". During the grinding hikes,
Company was always up at the* top
in its showing. Its men stuck to the
game and finished together. During
the tests, the company's showing was^
such as to Gladden the hearts of both
Captain Grossman and Major Utley.
The spirit of the men was excellent.
Under the most trying hardships,' they'
kept to the bright side and were al
ways jollying each other along. This
spirit is the most potential quality
in good soldiering, and had the com
pany gone into Mexico you would
surely have heard good things of
them.
The morals of the men were good.
Brownsville, is a widq open town. It
was conceded to be about as "rotten"
as a place could~be. Temptation was
rife. Yet, the men stood up splendid
•y under it all. Even when the men
knew they were going home, they
did not let down. There seemed to
be the feeling among the boys that
they were pretty close to home after
all, and they wanted to live up to
what was expected of them. As Major
Utley wtfd on his final (nspeot'.on of
the.troop ^rain before raachlng Des
Moiueir, "I guess th^re, is nothing
wrong wtth the behavior, 6f Company
H"

,.v
TJte:health of the contp&ny was par
excellence throughout ttie service.
ThecaniP was Idea! iter health and
sanitation. It is understood that Gen
eral Funs ton said the Iowa Camp was
the beat he had ever inspected. There
was hardly a single serious illness in
Company during the whole, six
months. When the company left
Brownsville It was summer weather.
At Kansas city it was zero weather.
The company arrived in Des Moines
without a single sick man. In a
couple of weeks the boys-will be home
as a company. I hope- you will be
able to look them over and see if you
have ever noticed a healthier. huskier
bunch.

Northern railroad is to be Junked and

out dispatches from New- fork last

Attorneys 'n this ity do not agree
nu the right of Sonker to junk the
road tot present L'nier tlie Iowa laws
a railroad is real estate provided the
company owning it owns in fee Bimplc
the real estate on the ri&ht of way.
and if this is the case the owuers
would have yeor in which to Te
ueani tbe prov^rty. Ou the other
hand, if the real estate is held under
a rant to belong to the company as
long as the road is operated and to
revert to tho original owners when the
road is abandoned, then the railroal
becomes personal property and the
federal court has the right to permit
its sale and removal. Those who have
reiad the notices of sale prepared by
the federal court are not quite clear
as to their meaning, also they are not
certain whether the road is realty or
personal property and a court ruling
may be necessary to settle the dis
puted point.
There also was some 'talk about
other railroadf which own cars set
out on the C. A. & N. road, bringing
suit to recover thein. This action,
however, was said by a railroad at
torney to be unnecessary as the roads
owning the cars could send a locomo
tive onto the road and haul the cars
to another, line, or even use a team of
horses to move them.'
It was said today that the C&tli in
terests have not' entirely abandoned
their efforts to obtain the property.
It is known that conferences have beeti
held with some of the bond holders
at Chicago this week, the-object of
which
wbb
to devise some means of
redeeming the property. Just what
plans, if any, were agreed on could
not be ascertained in this city today.
The C. A. ft N. road is thlrty-Bix
miles in length and its rolling stock
consists of six freight cars, two com
bination passenger coachea, three lo
comotives and six-steel bridges. -Mr.
Sonker has announced that he will
also junk the Iowa Short line which
be recently acquired and ship the
material to Europe. He

HEAVY CHRISTMAS MAILS,.
Never in the history of tbe' fo'ca/
postoffice was the Christmas mail so I
heavy as this year. The situation was
general all over the country, due in
part to the Increasing parcel post busi
ness. For a week before Christmas
every mail was a heavy one and by
Saturday every train brought a staclc
of mail. To relieve the congestion in
the office and to deliver all Christmas
mall promptly. City deliveries were
made on both Sunday and Monday.
