LITTLE ROCK. Ark., Dec. 26.
Nine persons are known to have
been killed and fourteen are
known to have been injured in a
tornado which swept a four mile
path over south central Arkansas
late today. Unconfirmed reports
tell of many more deaths, which

, cation is restored and the com-:
plete- story of the storm is .told.-'
The death lists Include four
white persons and five negroes.
Three Girls Killed
Three little girls were the vic
tims of the storm at Carlysle. At
England, a planter, Albert Swartz.

daughter were seriously injured
when their home was demolished.
Two negroes were killed near
Pine Bluff. .two were killed at

near England.
Scores Succumb
Reports persist that a .negro
colony near Keo was wiped out
and that seventeen were killed.
Another report tells of the death
of from fifteen to twenty killed
at the state farm at Tucker. All
efforts to reach Tucker by wire
have failed.
The plantation home of Joseph
Pilkington, near Pine Bluff, was de
molished and his wife and two chil
dren narrowly escaped. Four negroes
living on the place were injured and
one of them probably will die. The
property loss there is about $20,000.
According to reports the . tornado

northeast for a distance of about 60
miles and finally spent itself -near
Des Arc and Devall Bluff.

French, general manager of i
Phelps Dodge and company's pro- j
perties in the southwest, was ap-
pealed to today by a Douglas
newspaper, to see if his company
could not arrange to have coal
shipped from its mine at Dawson,
N. M., to relieve the fuel famine
here. Mr. French promised tt
see what could be done.
Douglas people clamored for
coal today, visiting or telephon-
ing dealer after dealer, only to
find there was none to be had.
The fuel dealers said they were
powerless and blamed the rail-
roads. One man said a car of coal
consigned to him from New Mex-
ico had been confiscated for its
own use by the Santa Fe railroad.
Murh suffering was reported
among the poor people of this

' EL PASO, Dec. 26. A report
was received here late today by
sources known to be close to
Francisco Villa and by govern
ment agents saying that Villa's
forces captured San Luis Potosi
yesterday from the de facto garri
son. .No details of the fighting
were given. - Unusual interest is
attached to the report because of
the fact that many of the foreign
population of Torreon, who left
there before Villa attacked went
to San Luis Potosi.
. Villa Seeks Tampico
San Luis Potosi is southeast of Tor
reon on the National Railroad line be
tween Aguas Calientes and Tampico.
Tampico is believed to be Villa's ob
jective in order to obtain port through
which hecan import arnffs, ammuni
tion and supplies.
Chihuahua Threatened
Villa was reported to be between
Torreon and Chihuahua City and was
said to be preparing to launch an at
tack agaiast Chihuahua City soon.
In anticipation of this attack. Gen
eral Francisco Murguia was reported
to have ordered General Francisco
Gonzales, former commander in Juar
ez, to proceed south at once with his
entire brigade to reinforce the Chihua
hua City garrison. General Murguia
also requested all of the available
troops from bis brother. General Jose
