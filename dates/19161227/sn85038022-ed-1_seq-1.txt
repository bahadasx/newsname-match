MARSHAL'S THROAT CUT
KftnllH Wait Hi.- Srrnr of Orr-al Excite
airnt on I.hhI Natnrrfay Maht
W hi n Wi s. Ojpbh Cut Throat
of H. I,, hllln.
A (treat dual of excitement was had
in the town of Sanlli In the south
weatcrn portion of this county on laat
Saturday night, when Mr. H. L. Kel
ley, the marshal of the village, waa
wounded by W. 8. Hyena.
Wi'ordlng to a report received at
this office Mr. Kelley was standing on
the sidewalk In the town talking to an
other gentleman, ftyena, who was a
stranger In the place, came out of a
store and addressed a remark to Kel
ley who answered him. Dyens did not
like the anawer he received pulling a
knife from his pocket made a stab at
Keltoy. The latter's throat was cut.
Dyens immediately escaped from tin
town and although a warrant has
been secured for his arrest he has not
been found up to the present time. He
. waa a total stranger in the town and
had been drinking. He was with sev
eral other men who assisted in his
escape.
Mr. Kelley's condition is not thought
to be serious although he was cut In
a very dangerous place. The officer
had done nothing to incur the enmity
of Ovens as far as we could learn. If
the rugltive is caught he will probably
get a very stiff sentence.

Hon. Q. W. Adair died at hla home
on Weat Second street yesterday at
12:10 p. in after a very short Illness.
His death was due to congestion of the
lungs. Mr. Adair bad been in falllna
health for some time although never
confined to his bed. On last Friday
night he waa taken sick but on Satur
day morning he went to his office on
Market street! but soon returned
home, he feeling unable to get about
No fears were entertained over his
condition until late Sunday night when
It was seen that the end was near.
George Washington Adair was born
at Lewlaburg in this county, Septem
ber 29, 1844. He was tbe aon of Wil
liam and Sarah Adair and was a de
scendant of John Adair, who was gov
ernor of Kentucky from 1820 to 1824.
When he was about 4 years old his par
ents removed with him to Lewis coun
ty where he lived until he had reach
ed manhood. At the age of 25 he went
to Mt. Olivet and began to teach
school, later teaching In Murphysvllle
In this county.
In 1881 he began tbe practice of law
in this city, studying under the late
Henry Wadsworth. From 1893 to 1896
ho held the office of County Attorney.
Since that time he had lived in this
city where he had a very large prac
tice. Not only in this city nnd county
but in the surrounding section of the
country he was known as an able
lawyer and as one of his many friends
characterized him upon hearing of his
death, "He knew his law."
He was married on February 21,
1871, to Miss Sallie Paul, daughter of
the late John Paul of Dover, who was
one of the pioneer families of this
county. To them were born five chil
dren, four of whom survive. They are
Mrs. Maude Farnaworth of Pasca
goula, Miss., Mr. John P. Adair of Chi
cago, Mr. Asa Adair of Covington, Ky.
and Mr. Robert Adair of tins city. He
leaves no brothers or sisters, being
the last of five children.
He waa tbe oldest member of the
Mason County Bar Association, botb
in the number of years and practice.
Mr. Adair was one of the most so
ciable men in this eity and was a
great lover of the young people. He
always had a pleasant word for every
one and was characterized by his sun
ny disposition and kind and welcome
words for all. He had a very appre
ciative eye for the beautiful things in
naturo and this was shown by his
many short poems that were printed
from time to time. His writings were
simple and contained a beautiful lyri
cal strain, which made them very dis
tlnctive.
Mr. Adair was a man whe friends
could almost be counted by 'the num
ber of his acquaintances. His pleas
ing personality readily made friends
for him and he rarely forgot one that
he had met. He was a kind and af
fectionate husband and father and was
a great lover of his home.
The funeral arrangements have not
been made awaiting the arrival of his
daughter, who will reach thla city to
night. The announcement of this will
be made In tomorrow's Ledger, al
though at press time it waa thought:
that the service would be held at
o'clock from the home tomorrow after
noon. 1
