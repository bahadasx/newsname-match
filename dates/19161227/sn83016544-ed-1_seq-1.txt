The proposition to establish paper
mills by the state is meeting with
considerable support among the
newspapers of the state. The pro­

legislature at the coming session.
The state has an immense amount of
pulp wood on its lands, and utilizing
prison ltabor would make a go of it
just as it did with the binder twine
and farm machinery plant at Still­
water. An exchange facetiously re­
marks that they could get expert la­
bor by putting all the present paper
makers of the state in the peniten
I tiary where they belong.—Ely Miner.

SWITCHMEN ORANTED AN
EIGHT-HOUR DAY
Action by Federal Board off Arbitra­
tion Hat Important Bearing on
The Adamson Law is Belief.
New York, Dec. 23.—The eight
hour day with straight pro rata time
for over time is granted to the
Switchmen's union by the Federal
arbitration board in a decision today
in the switchmen's controversy with
the railroads. The award gives an
increase of 5 cents per hour for both
foremen and helpers.
"This decision in the switchmen's
controversy with railroads has an
important bearing on the Adamson
law," it was stated here today by an
official spokesman for the confer­
ence committee of managers of the
railroads.
"It does not 0. K. the Adamson
act, in our opinion. The Adamson
legislature gave the men ten hours
pay for eight hours of work, or an
incresae of about 25 percent in wa­
ges. The award today gives, the
switchmen only nine hours pay for
eight hours of work, or between 13
and 16 per cent increased wages. We
get a great deal of satisfaction out
of this award."
It was pointed out on behalf of
the roads that they were pleased
with what was alluded to as the
switchmen arbitration board's liberal
exposition, in its document filed in
the Federal court, of the roads argu­
ment as advanced during the hearing
here. Nearly all of the roads' con­
tentions were emphasized, it was de­
clared.
The meetings between the confer­
ence committee of managers and the
brotherhood chiefs to discuss the A
damson act have been held in abey­
ance pending the settlement of the
switchmen's demands. With this
controversy out of the way, it was
stated by railroad officials today, the
Adamson conference will be resumed
after Christmas. It was said, how­
ever, that the situation probably will
remain in status quo until the Unit­
ed States .supreme court has deter­
mined the constitutionality of the
Adamson act.
SANG HYMN ACROSS RIO
GRANDE CHRISTMAS EVE
Mexico sang to the United States
and the United States sang to Mexi­
co in an unusual Chistmas celebra­
tion at Eagle Pass, Texas, on Christ­
mas eve, when a member of the choir
of the Piedras Negras Roman Catho­
lic church, standing on the Mexican
bank of the Rio Grande, sang the
first stanza of the "Adeste Fideles"
—"Come ye Faithful"—the second
stanza being immediately picked up
by a member of the choir of the
Eagle Pass church of our Lady of
Refuge, on the Texas bank of the in­
ternational boundary. Alternating
in this manner, the entire hymn was
rendered.
In the local Roman Catholic church
regular soldiers and Tennessee and
Maryland guardsman sang "Silent
Night," the hymn being rendered in
13 different languages, including En
glish, Spanish, Russian, Greek, Sy­
rian and Japanese.
The Fifth Maryland regiment early
in the evening arranged a Christmas
tree on the courthouse lawn, more
than 3,000 toys being distributed to
children of Eagle Pass and Pedras
Negras. The tree was the gift of
the city of Baltimore, the toys were
donated by Baltimore citizens and
the tree and the toys were brought
to the border in a special car by a
railroad company.

SCHOOL ENTERTAINMENT
STAGED LAST THURSDAY
Largo Audience Sees Good Program
at Sohool Auditorium on Last
Thursday Evening.
On last Thursday night a large
number attended the Christmas pro­
gram at the School Auditorium given
by the Grand Marais school. It con­
sisted of songs, pantomines, tableaus,
and a playette, all of which were
well done and a credit to the school
and community. "The Holy City," a
pantomine by some of the larger
girls is entitled to special mention,
as well as the pretty little games by
the pupil's of the primary room un­
der the direction of Miss Riedesel.
"Mrs. Ruggles Christmas dinner"
was enjoyed by all. Every number
presented was nicely done and a cre­
dit to the teachers who had the pro­
gram in charge as well as those
taking part.
FARMERS' CLUBS OF STATE
WILL HOLD BIG MEET
Minnesota's great group of 1250
farmers' clubs will hold its second
annual meeting at University Farm,
St. Paul, January 2, 3, and 4, and
during this time will make a special
study of the subject of farm loans
Under the new federal farm loan act.
The meeting will be held during
Farmers' and Home-Makers' Week,
which is expected to bring at least
2,000 to University farm, so that the
farmers' club group, or the Minneso­
ta State Federation of Farmers'
Clubs as it is known, will be very
largely attended.
H. L. Bugbee, president of the fe­
deration, however, has issued a call
to every farmers' club in the state
to send at least one representative.
In this call he says that the first
year's work of the organization has
pointed out great posibilSties of de
/elopment, and that the meeting
should be largely attended, in order
that the federation may take steps
to meet its opportunities, and fur­
ther that it may make a careful stu
of the federal farmJqsxmu^
The call closes with the words:
"Every farmers' club, should take
an interest in this coming meeting."
STATE'S POTATO MEN WILL
MEET JANUARY 3( 1917
Questions of vital intest to pota­
to growers of Minnesota will be ta­
ken up at the second annual meeting
of the Minnesota Potato Growers As­
sociation, to be held at University
Farm, January 3, 1917, in connection
with Farmers' and Home-Makers'
Week. A potato exhibit is also be­
ing planned.
Potato diseases and their control
will be discussed by G. R. Bisby, as­
sistant plant pathologist, Minnesota
experiment station. The degenera­
tion of varieties will be discussed by
Richard Wellington, assistant horti­
culturist, Minnesota experiment sta­
tion. Results of seed plot demon­
strations will be set forth by K. A.
Kirkpatrick, county agent of Henne­
pin county. If nothing intervenes,
C. T. More of the United States De­
pigment of Agriculture will give a
talk on potato marketing. A spe­
cial conference on potato seed certi­
fication will be led by Dr. E. C. Stak
man, head of the section of plant
pathology of the Minnesota experi­
ment station.
For the exhibit every potato grow­
er in the state is urged to send in
samples, consisting of one peck (15
pounds) of any standard variety re­
commended by the association. These
should be shipped to A. .G Tolaas,
University Farm, St. Paul.
ORCHARDS MAY BE
PRUNED IN WINTER
Fruit growers do not need to wait
until spring to prune their orchards,
says W. G. Brierly, of the division
of horticulture at University Farm.
Results at University farm show lit­
tle or no difference in the growth
and maturity of the wood where
pruning has been done any time be­
tween November and May.
If thie usual care is taken to make
the cuts close to the main trunk or
branches no stubs will be left to die
and decay, though the covering of
wounds with a white lead and oil
paint or with common grafting wax
warme$ to the consistency of cold
molasses will give added protection.
Moderate pruning is better than
heavy pruning or regular.
For. Sale—A good farm horse,
weight about 1200 pounds. Can be

NEW ORGANIZATION
NOW BEING FORMED
What will be known as the Lake
Superior Fair Association, controll­
ing a circuit including St. Louis,
Carlton, Lake, Aitkin and Itasca
counties in Minnesota, and Douglas
and Washington counties in Wiscon­
sin is being formed. At a meeting*
held in the court house in Duluth
December 19th a temporary organi­
zation was perfected. Among those
present at the meeting were Wilbur
Ross, president, and Frank E. Spring
secretary of the Tri-State Fair As­
sociation, of Superior, Wis. W. B.
Woodard, secretary of the Lake
County Agricultural Society, of Two
Harbors, Minn. H. G. Larsen, county
agricultural agent for St. Louis coun­
ty A. B. Hostetter, G. W. Small, O.
A. Anderson and J. Kimball, of Du­
luth. Wilbur Ross of Superior was
elected and G. W. Small of Duluth
was elected secretary of the tempo­
rary organization. The organization
is being perfected for the purpose
of avoiding conflicting dates for
holding the fairs given by the differ­
ent local organizations, and to ar­
range for uniform standard premium
lists, and making such other harmo­
nious arrangements as may be found
possible and desirable. The recom­
mendation was made that the fair
given by the Tri-State Fair Associa­
tion in Superior be held the week fol­
lowing the Minnesota State Fair, and
that the fairs in Lake and Carlton
counties be held the following week,
on such dates as would be mutually
agreeable to those two organizations,
and that the Duluth Exposition be
eld the following week. Aitkin,
Washburn and Itasca counties were
ut represented at the meeting, but
the delegates from those counties
ent word that non-conflicting dates
in October would be satisfactory to
their organizations. It is apparent
that considerable good will come
Tom this organization. Where fairs
are held on conflicting dates it has
not been possible for parties to ex­
hibit at more than one fair, and the
-securing of competent judges has
been hard„ and at times almost im­
possible. By arranging a circuit
with non-conflicting dates it will be
possible for people to exhibit at any
or more of the fairs and judges can
go from one fair to another and thus
greatly simplify matters, especially
'f they can agree on a uniform pre­
mium list. The next meeting of the
Lake Superior Fair Association will
be held in Duliuth January 16, 1917,
at which time the permanent organi­
sation will be perfected. It is ex
necte.d that delegates from all the
organizations in the circuit will be
present at that time.—Two Harbors

COOK COUNTY
STATE BANK
Capital and Surplus, $27,500.00
FARM LOAN ASSOCIATION
NEEDS LARGE MEMBERSHIP
The Federal Farm Loan Law re­
quires that associations formed un­
der the law must apply for at least
$20,000.00 in loans. With the pre­
sent valuations of farms and the lim­
iting of. loans to 50 per cent of the
valuation, a farm loan association for
Cook county will need a large mem­
bership. In order to get a more de­
finite idea of the feasibility of or­
ganizing in this county, it is sugges­
ted that those interested filll out the
slip below and mail or leave the
same at the "News-Herald" office.
I am interested in the form­
ing of a Federal Farm Loan As­
sociation for this county.
