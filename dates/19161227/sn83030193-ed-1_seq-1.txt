across tho register:
"W. Irving Snow, manager French

Ono second later ho was calling the

At present n temporary Injunction

Mr. Ilcx'so argued for a continua

'because I wanted my baby to enjoy

TO AVOID
1
Threat Contained
May Have to Be Carried Out if
the Effort to Bring About a
" Conference Fails.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 27. Despite a general feeling of hopeless
ness among Government heads over prospects for peace, in the light of
Germany's latest communication, men closest to President Wilson be
lieved to-day he will strive to the utmost to prevent the situation getting
beyond his grasp.
Two reasons, they said, will actuate him a desire to end the war,
and a desire, if possible, to avoid having to put through the threat in the
Sussex nole to break relations willi Germany should that nation over
step her submarine pledges.
Officials made no secret of their pessimism over the probable allied
rejection of the German proposal for a round table conference- This
was the more emphatic because Germany does not propose now to link
the idea of a world peace guaranty with the round table session appar
ently. The allies want such a theme included. Men in touch with Wil
son say the "door is not closed."
While the idea of obtaining peace is uppermost in Administration
minds, there is among the inner circle a fear that a break with Germany
is inevitable if present peace proposals fail. One of the highest officials
said to-day that present plans call for no more note writing to Germany.
If, lie milled, tin .Miirlna, Arabia nnd otlicr rases dcTelop rlcur-
Ciit flotation of (iorinan pledges in Mm .Sussex case, or If Germany
filurts n ii cur submarine campaign in case peace falls, then a break
In relullons can he tlio only answer.
He declared that President Wilson's note and Secretary Lansing's
subsequent statement about the "verge of war" were in a measure edu
cational, so that the country would not wonder what it was all about in
event matters came up to the breaking point.
Official information has been received here that Sweden has ad
dressed a peace note to the belligerents and sent copies to neutrals urging
consideration of terms for peace.
Reports from Home that Germany had presented to the neutral
nations sealed packets containing terms were the subject of much com
ment. The Home report said the packets were not to be opened unless
Germany's enemies requested terms. In German circles here it was con
sidered more probable that direct information would be conveyed to
President Wilson through Ambassador Gerard.

R. C. WOOD MUSI
S
PLEA IS REJECTED
Judge iNolt Refuses lo Dismiss
Indictment Against Former
Service Commissioner.
DUTY TO THIS PUBLIC.
District Attorney's Office Sur
prised by "Unusual" Ruling
of the Court.
Judgo Nott to-day denied the re
quest mndo by District Attorney
Swann to dismiss tho. Indictment
against Hobcrt Colgate Wood, former
Public Service Commissioner, Indicted
for bribery Jan. 25 last. The Court
also refused to dlschargo the bond of
$5,000 furnished by Wood at the time
of his arrest.
Tho action of Judgo Nott created
surprise In the District Attorney's
office. It has been customary for
Judges to accept the recommendation
of tho District Attorney In such re
quests. District Attorney Hwnnn will
have to placo Wood on trial
Judge Nott recites tho facts stt
forth In the Indictment, and says:
"The recommendation of tho Dis
trict Attorney Is based on two rea
sons: "First That the micress of tho
prosecution depends upon tho testi
mony of Sidney G. Johnson: thnt
Johnson Is mi unwilling witness; thnt
his testimony Is vague, and thnt by
his recent acts and declarations hu has
mnulfi'stiHl his hostility nnd has re
fused to discuss the caso further.
".Second That thnro Is a question
of fact In tho enso whether or not
Johnson Is nn accomplice of the de
fendant. It being evident that If he is
nn, accomplice the necessary corrob
oration of his testimony Is lacking.
"Where nn Indictment for a felony
Is returned ngalnst n public oftlcer,
holding an Important position, public
policy requires thnt the case ngalnst
him bo pullcly tried, unless It Is per
fectly apparent that under no pus
slblo circumstances can thu prosecu
tion succeed, especially whvro it Is
evident that tho trial of tho case
cannot bo a prolonged one, unduly
obstructing other public business.
"In this case, whllo tho nvldonco ot
Johnson In certain rospcctH is Indefi
nite, yet, If It Is believed by a Jury
nnd hn Is not nn accomplice, a prima
fnelo caso against tho defendant Is
mndo out. Very often tho fact that a
witness Is unwilling nnd Is testifying
ngalnst his Inclinations adds strength
to iris testimony.
"Tho mem fact that Johnson hns
refused to iIIhcuhs tho case further or
aid In Its further prosecution docs not
provo by any means that ho will run
tho risk of nn Indictment for perjury
by changing tho testimony already
given by him."
Discussing Judge Nott's action, Dis
trict Attorney Swann said:
"I hopo Judge Nott will try the
rase. I will ask him to do so. Kvl
dently ho tlocs not agree with his as
sociate, Judgo Wadhiun, who granted
tho motion to Inspect the minutes of
tho Grand Jury and gave permission
that tho motion for the dismissal of
tho Indlctmont be mado on thu merits
of the case. Judge Wadliam publicly
said that tho Indictment uliuuld bo
dismissed. It will be utterly Impossi
ble to secure u conviction."

GERMAN AGENTS AT HAGUE

LONDON, Dec. 27. England intends to tell the world exactly
what site Is fighting for. Her answer to President Wilson's note sug
gesting that belligerents in the great war define their peace terms will be
a clear outline of the objects which Great Britain and her allies hope to
attain.
That tills sort of a note is now In process of formulation was learned
on unquestioned authority by the United Press this afternoon.
Presumably It was this, bull- 4

second said: "General Joffre, Commander-in-Chief
of tho French forces,

Tho high command as now settled

BKrtMN, Dec. 27.-The Berlin

generally support Germany's reply to
tho American peace note. Count
Hovcntlow also withholds complete
approval of the note In his comment.
Tho Tabeglatt declares that despite
the events of Christmas week, peace
seems no nearer.
Ilovcntlow and the Tngeblatt both
point out that neutral powers were
not Invited to participate In the peace
conferences suggested In the German
note.
Count Reventlow declared the
only answer Germany could give
to Lloyd Gaorge Is to heedletily
and recklessly apply every msans

value of Germany's submarines in
this connection,
"Tho Gorman reply shows the Ger
