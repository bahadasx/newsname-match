GERMANY WANTS INSTANT I
OF ALL
Meeting of Delegates in Neutral
Place Best Plan.
PROMPT REPLY TO PRESIDENT'S
NOTE IS GIVEN
Washington Reserve Comment Until
Official Text is Had.
Berlin, Dec. 26.-Germany and her
allies, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and
Turkey, today replied to the note of
President Wilson in which he asked
the belligerent nations to state the
aims for which they were fighting.
The propopal is made by the Cen
tral powers that a conference of dele
gates of all the belligerents be held
immediately in a neutral city.
The task of preventing future wars,
the official statement says, can be be
gun only after the end of the present
struggle.
The answer, which also contains the
reply of Austro-Hungary, Bulgaria
and Turkey, says:
"The high-minded sugestion made
by the President of the United States
of America in order to create a basis
for lasting peace has been received
and considered by the imperial gov
ernment in the friendly spirit which
was expressed in the President's com
munication.
"The President points out that
which he has at heart and leaves open
the choice of road.
"To the imperial government an ex
change of views seems the most ap
propriate road to reach desired re
sults.
"We therefore suggest an immedi
ate meeting of delegates of the bellig
erent states at a neutral place.
"The imperial government is also
of the opinion that the great work of
preventing future wars can be begun
only after the end of the present
struggle of the nations.
"It will, when this moment shall
have come, be ready with pleasure to
collaborate entirely with the United
States in this exalted task."
The answer of the Central powers
conck. des with the usual diplomatic
terms' of politeness.
Washington Surprised.
Washington, Dec. 26-Officials here
are surprised that Germany's answer
to President Wilson's 1peace note was
given out in Berlin before it reached
this country in official form. They
pointed out that in sending his note,
President Wilson allowed two (lays
between the time of its dispatch and
making it public that it might first
reach the German government.
RAILROAD NET EARNINGS
ARE OVER A BILLION
Washington, Dec. 25.-The net
earnings of the railroads of the Unit
ed States for the year 1916, will
amount to more than a billion dollars
undler present condlitions, accordling to
reports to the interstate commerce
e. ornmission.
The comission has complete re
ports on the earnings and expenses
of the railroads for the first nine
months of the year, andl they showv a
phenomenal gain in the business and
earnings of the carriers for that pe
riodl. With the railroads continuing
their record-breaking business until
the endl of the year they wvill show
net earnings of about a thousand mil
lions.
The monthly reports submitted to
the commission by the roadls, indi
cate that the increasedl net earnings,
which amount to the neighborhood of
a hundred million a month, have in
creased for two reasons.
First, the tremendous increase in
trafme (due to the export business in
cident to the European war has 'in
creased the gross revenues, and sec
ond, the roads have generally reduced
the ratio of operating expenses to
gross income. As a result the net
income has grown by leaps and
boundls.
Trhe general increase began shortly
..after the railroads were granted in-.
creasedl freight rates in the five per
cent rate case, the Westein rate cases
and various related applications for
higher rates, which covered practical
ly the whole country. Immediately:
after these rates were advanced the
monthly reports show that the ope
rating expenses took a drop and the
gross' income increated. The operat
ing expenses continuedl low right up
PEACE COUNCIL
THE BELLIGERENT NATIONS
In the absence of an official -reply
formal comment was withheld at the
White House and State Department.
The direct conference of delegates at
a neutral-place was regarded as a fur
ther step in Germany's proposal, al
though officials considered it as hav
ing been definitely forecast in the
first proffer. Such a formal offer has
repeatedly been mentioned in author
ized. statements at the Germany em
bassy here, where the opinion has
been freely expressed that if dele
gates could once be gathered around
the table for discussing peace the re
sult surely would be an arrangement
of peace terms.
Difference of View.
The Berlin dispatch containing the
German reply was read by President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing with
the greatest interest. Some officials
who compared the reply with Presi
dent Wilson's note professed to see
some conflict between the German
statement that the work of securing
the future peace of the world should
be delayed until the end of the pres
ent struggle, while others were of the
opinion that it was not entirely out of
harmony.
President Wilson's purpose has re
peatedly been expressed as making
for the prevention of future wars as
a part of the settlement of the pres
ent conflict but admittedly that is a
subject broad enough to allow some
variation when it conies to final con
sideration.
Count von Bernstorff had gone to
New York and so fa. as could be
learned, the German embassy's only
information was in the Associated
Press dispatches.
The unofficial text of Germany's re
ply did not get before the cabinet be
cause the Tuesday meeting was sud
denly abandoned a few minutes before
the secretaries were due at the White
House.
Stock Market Rises.
New York, Dec. 26.-Publication of
the latest German proposals was fol
lowed by a moderate increase in ac
tivity of the stock market today with
a gradual rise in prices. The market
had previously been extremely (lull
and immediately preceding the publi
cation of the German communication
prices of important stocks were mid
way between the high and low of the
forenoon.
The rise that followed appeared to
be due to short covering more than
anything else. United States Steel ad
vanced 2 3-4 points from the low quo
tation of the morning.
again.
The final calculation of the inter
state commerce commision as to the
earnings of the roads for the year
1916, which will be completed early
next year, are expected to show an
unprecedented total. There is no
doubt that the commission's findings
will be generally used in an effort
to influence proposedI national rail
road legislation, nor that it will ma
terially effect the wage controversy
between the railroads and their ope
rating employes.
Railroad officials, say, however,
that the condlitions growing < t of the
European war have indluced an ab
normal increase in business and that
it would be unfair to base future cal
culations on the diguren, for theQ cur
reint year.
MALIIURN MIAY RESIGN.
Washington, D~ec. 26.-W~illiam P.
Malburn, of D~enver, Colo., assistant
secretary of the treasury, adlmitted
tonight a probability that he will re
tire to private life, Hie stated, how

-XMAS GIFTS ON THE TABLE
Robbery Supposed to Have Been
Motive of Tragedy. One Son
Escapes.
Minden, La., Dec. 25.-After an all
day search through isolated sections
of Webster parish, members of a
posse formed this morning to search
for the murderers of John N. Reeves,
his wife and young child, tonight ar
rived here with three heavily man
acled negroes. The prisoners were
placed in separate cells in the parish
jail here and a special armed guard
of deputies was stationed about the
building to prevent threatened mob
violence. Possemen answered no ques
tions and no one was allowed to ap
proach within 100 yards of the jail.
First reports of the tragedy were
received early today at a farm house
near the Reeves home. A seven-year
old boy partly dressed rushed into
the farm house at dawn and said:
"All of the Reeves family are killed."
Other neighbors ere summoned, and
when the party entered the Reeves
home they found Reeves dead in bed,
his head crushed and deep wounds,
apparently inflicted ith an axe, cov
ering his body. Lying before the
fireplace in another room was the
eleven-year-old boy, unconscious, his
skull fractured and his les and arms
slashed. Still clutched in the arms
of the older boy was his fifteen
months-old brother, badly cut and
bruised. In a third room, rapped in
a blood-soaked blanket, was the five
year-old boy. He a!so was cut and
bruised.
Christmas Gifts.
Neatly arranged on a pine board
table were the simple Christmas pres
ents which, before retiring, the par
ents evidently had placed here to sur
prise the children in the morning.
After searching the rooms of the
house the party went to the rear yard
and found Mrs. Reeves with a bullet
hole in her head and her body horri
bly mutilated.
The three wounded children were
taken to a hospital in Shreveport, the
eldest (lying shortly after his arrival
there. Reports received here from
Shreveport toniht were that the two
other children had little chance for
recovery.
The seven-year-old bo', the only
one in the house to escape, was
sleeping in the loft and arose to
light the fire at dawn when he made
the discovery that sent him running
to the nearest house.
Tracks Around House.
Tracks around the house indicated
there were at least two murderers.
It was believed Mr. and Mrs.
Reeves were killed while asleep.
The Reeves' had lived in this par
ish only a few years. Reeves was a
native of Houston County, Texas.
The house ocupied by the Reeves
family is located about n ine miles
from M indlen in a fairly popuilous
neighborhood.
Reeves, according to several of his
neighbors, did not believe in banks
andl it was said had openly boasted he
kept $4,000 locked in a tool chest in
his house and was "prepa redl to de
fend it with hot lead.'"
The tool chest with the lock broken
off was found later in a room which
the boy, wvho gave out the first news
of the crime, saidl was not the place
where it customarily was kept
Reeves, his neighbors sa'd, had no
regular occup~ation but. was known as
a successful gambler.

DEATH Of MR. J. H. CHANDLER
WELL KNOWN AND HIGHLY ES
TEEMED SUMTER CITIZEN
PASSES AWAY.
Death Occurred Sunday Morning in
Hospital at Baltimore, Where lie
Had Gone to Rest Up-Funeral
This Morning at Presbyterian
Church.
The whole community was sadden
ed on Sunday when the news of the
death of James H. Chandler became
known over Sumter and the sur
rounding country, where the deceased
had lived all of his life and was
known by nearly everybody and high
ly esteemed by all who knew him.
Death came at 8:25 Sunday morn
ing at Shephard and Platt's Hospital
at Baltimore, where Mr. Chandler had
gone about two weeks ago for rest
and recuperation from a run-down
condition and nervousness, followin-.
bereavements in his family. While
at the hospital he contracted pneu
monia which, with a complication of
troubles, hastened his end. He was
attended by his son, Dr. James J.
Chandler and other physicians, who
did all that was posible for him, but
their human remedies were without
effect, when a higher Power called.
The body was brought from Balti
more and arrived here Monday morn
ing at 11:15 o'clock. Dr. James
Chandler, son of the deceased, and
Dr. W. M. Shaw, accompanied the
body to Sumter. On its arival it
was met by a large concourse of
friends and relatives, who escorted
the remains to former home of the
deceased on Church street, where they
were viewed by nany of those who
had known and respected him during
his lifetime.
The funeral services were held this
morning at 11 o'clock at the Pres
byterian church, of which he was a
ruling elder, the services being con
ducted by the pastor, Rev. J. P. Ma
rion. The exercises were simple, but
deeply impressive. The body was in
terred at the Sumter cemetery and
many beautiful flowers cevered the
grave. At the grave the servies
were in charge of Claremont Lodge
No. (4, A. P. M., of which the de
ceased was a member. A large con
course of friends and relatives at
tended the funeral services at the
church and followed the body to the
grave to pay their sad tribute of re

Arthur Henderson of War Council
Declares Compromise With Ger
many Impossible.
MOST DANGElROUS PERIOD OF
WAR NOW FOR DEMOCRACIES
Frightful Strain May Lead to Mort
gage of the Future to Impe
rialism.
Paris, Dec. 2.-In addresses at the
national congress of the French So
cialist party Arthur Henderson, th
British cabinet minister, and J. H.
Roberts, member of the British par
lianent both affirmed, amidst enthu
siastic cheers, that the war must be
fought out until full guarantees have
been obtained for a lasting peace.
"Inl miny opinion" said Mir. Hender
son "if France and ourselves were to
enter into negotiation, under exist
ing conditions we should be nations
in bondage. Nothing less than that
is the price and our enemies would
exact for peace today."
Emil Vandervelde the Belgian so
cialist leader said:
"Our comrades who have remained
in invaded Belgium during German
dominion with admirable firmness
have made of themselves heroes.
Nothing but encouragement reaches
us from them. So that it would seem
that the persons most hostile to war
are those farthest from it."
M. Vandervelde also declared that
the struggle must be carried on until
Belgium and Serbia are delivered and
"Caesarism is laid low."
In his speech Mr. Hlenderson said:
"In my opinion we have now reach
ed the most dangerous and diflicult
period of the war. During the next
few months the democracies of Eng
land and France are going to be test
ed as never before. l)o not misunder
stand me. I do not mean that the
stress and strain of fighting in the
field will be more severe although I
do- not ignore such a possibility. But
the danger is of entirely d ifferent
character.
"Our stupendous losses, our un.i
precedented sacrifices, our horror 01
war, our love of peace may lead us
to mortgage the future. \Vith suci
awful experiences we are apt to for

MINISTER, WOULD
E FOR [NGLAND AND FRANCE
upon theresult of which depend all
our ;treat ideals. If we enter into
negotiations now we do so when Ger
many is not repentant for her wrong
doing and is glorifying in the success
of her military efforts in fact, in the
victory of German imperialism. In
my opinion if France and ourselves
were to enter into negotiations under
existing conditions with such a spirit,
we should be nations in bondage.
Nothing less than that is the price
which our enemy would exact for
peace today.
"I cannot tell you how many
months and what sacrifices stand be
tween us and victory. But I can tell
you what will be the rewards of vic
tory if we are true to ourselves. We
shall have asserted the right, of na
tions, large or small to live their own
lives undisturbed by the ambitions of
powerful neighbors. We shall have
exacted such reparation for wrongs
done them by this war as will be
arning to aggressors for all time to
come. We shall have laid the founda
tions of that guard of nations begin
ning with those who have fought and
suffered at our side, which will de
liver Europe and the world from the
terror of war.
"The choice today is between an un
timely peace with years of fear and
a few months of suffering with a
lasting peace. Take into considera
tion all the consequences of our de
cision I say that now, as in August,
1914, the nations are presented with
the choice as between honor and in
famy. The choice is more sacred now
as the choice has been scaled by the
blood of our heroic dead. We in Brit
ain feel that to make peace now, to
think of peace at any time with less
than full indemnity for the past and
full security for the future would be
to desert our Allies and betray the
hopes of freedom throughout the
worl.
Nations Must Be Free.
"We hate war. It is brutal, the ne
gation of everything for which we
stand. Therefore we must preveot
its recurrence so far as is in our
power. We desire to see the democ
racies of the world tree to progress
to their highest ideals. To accom
plish this we must stand together for
the destruction of militarism---the
vindication of nationel right and lih,
erty, the Punishment of natioma?
