TORPEDO BOATSWILLjGen.
VISIT M TOWN
Although no officia! information
is available as to the purpose of the
visit of the four torpedo destroyers
coming to Morgan City in February,
the fact that the boats will leave
shortly for a trip up the Mississippi
river as f»- as Vicksburg, Mississippi
for the purpose of boosting the re
cruiting service, indicates that the
boats will come here after Mardi
Gras for the same purpose. On the
trip up the river the boat will make
stops of from two to six days at the
important towns. Lieutenant Francis
Commorfor, commander of the Lam
ison said in New Orleans Tuesday
fro
the up state trip February 8th.
NINE NEGROES ARE IN JAIL AT
MONROE FOR REEVES MUR
DER.
The authorities at Monroe are
making every effort to bring the
guilty parties to justice for the as
sisination of John Nelson Reeves
who was murdered Monday. Nine
negroes are being held in the
Webster parish jail. They all protest
their innocence, but three of them
were found to have blood stains on
their hands and they have to give a
satisfactory explanation. In addition
to killing Reeves the assassins killed
his wife and two sons and badly in
jured a fifteen month old infant of
the family. The knowledge that
Reeves had money prompted the
crime.

RAILROADS SEEK AN INCREASE
Notice is being sent out by Shelby
Taylor, chairman of ths Railroad
Commission to the effect that a
hearing will be held before the com
mission on the application of the
railroads to raise their rates. Mr.
Taylor characterizes the proposed
j
i
increases as revolutionary and wants
the shippers of the state to takes
the proper steps to protect their in
terest. This is the result of the ac
tivity of the Natchez Mississippi
Chamber of Commerce in seeking
to adjust rates which they claimed
discriminated against Natchez in
favor of New Orleans.
CHRISTMAS POSTAL BUSINESS
SHOWS INCREASE OF 35 PER
CENT.
From December 11th until Xmas
day, the receipts of the local post
office showed an increase of 35 per
cent over the same period in 1915.
On account of the Xmas saving clubs
and bounses being paid between the
above dates, the Xmas business at
Uncle Sam's local institution was
later this year than usual, however
the rush of the last few days did not
swamp the employes and the mail
was handled with accuracy and
dispatch. The office was open on
both Sunday and Monday mornings
for the accomodation of patrons.

THE RESCUE OF LIFE
in case of fire is accounted no

can only be partially attained
after theonsvveep of the fiâmes
There is a way of rescue how
ever. A way that discounts
the damages of fire, smoke,

by a fire insurance policy from
a company that has a financial
reserve sufficiently large to
assure you of indemnity.
