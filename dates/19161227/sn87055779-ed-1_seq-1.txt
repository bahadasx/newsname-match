supreme attempt to overthrow th
Carranza government.
Villa trains are moving eastward
from Torreon, carrying ammunition
t his bandits and reinforcement in
the shape cf new recruits. Villlsta
forces are reported ready to strike
j. gainst both Chihuahua City and
Monterey, while the Carranzistas
are rushing reinforcements to the
garrison of hoth cities.
The capture of San Luis Potosi
opened the way for a westward
drive on the gulf porta of Tamplco
und Tuxpam. His adherents hero
declared today that soldler from the
C'arranza garrison already are de
serting to join the bandit troops un
!er command of Gen. Caballero. The
possession of the oil Melds about
Tuxpam and Tamplco would 'put
Mexico's chief source of revenue in
Villa's hands.
More troops left Juarez today for
Chihuahua City to defend the state
capital against the expected Villlsta
attack, and the fear of an attack on
I he border city is Increased. A big

itnother Villlsta force is still within

EATH MYSTERY
Woman, Stark Naked, Found
by Hotel Proprietor
in Hallway.
llhternatlonal New Servke:
DOVER. N. J., Dec. 27. A mur
der mystery as dark and wierdly un
canny as any of fiction, was unfolded
to authorities here today. The story
is three days old, but it has been lock
ed up in the breasts of a country
hotel keeper and a coroner.
Thomas W. Morfey. proprietor ot
the Lake Denmark hotel, was awak
ened on Christmas eve by a scratch
ing outside his door. He opened it,
and on the floor of the hallway lay
his housekeeper, Lillian Green. She
was moaning pitifully. She was
stark naked and on her body were
blotches caused by terrific burns.
"Why. you're all burned," said
Morfey.
"No, just scorched." she said and
died.
Morfey told the authorities she
had Kone out to meet a friend whom
he did not know early that evening.
He eard nothing, he said, until the
scratching came outside his door.
No footsteps were heard coming or
going, and the six hunting dogs
which he had in a kennel Just out
side the hotel were silent all night.
It would have been impossible, he
said, for anyone to have brought the
woman without his hearing them.
The ground was frozen hard outside,
and would have echoed footsteps.
Physicians who examined the body
Haid it would have been equally as
impossible for the woman to have
walked more than half a dozen
steps. Her feet were burned hor
ribly. MARY GARDEN IS THIN

International News Service:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 27. Subma

fensive power and radius of action
are being constructed by Germany.
The navy department here has been
informed, it was learned today, that
these great undersea fighting units
are being rushed to completion in
German shipyards and will be put
into service as fast as they are com
pleted. The only example of German sub
marine warcraft to reach American
chores the U-53, which put into
Newport unexpectedly after an un
heralded trans-Atlantic voyage
will be dwarfed in ability and pow
er by the new type of hubmersible,
the information here shows.
"While possessing greater speed
and cruising radius than present
types, the most striking feature of
the new ve?sels Is the fact that six
inch guns Ere mounted fore and aft.
Naval officers here pointed out to
day that the new submarines will
thus be able to lie so far away from

taring a shot cro.ss their bows that
the dancer of defensive guns on

are convinced from the information
In their pessessin, is the fact that
the incre;ised defensive arma
ment and greater gun power of the
new German type will enable it to
Vie put into use against destroyers
when absolutely necessary, and even
to prove a factor in the bombard

MAN I 'S NÖTE
MEANS NOTHING
International News Service:
LONDON, Dec. 2 7. The evasion
of terms in the German reply to
Pres't Wilson's note has placed a big
obstacle in the way of peace, ac
cording to views expressed in official
circles here today. J
It is pointed out here that the
note really contains nothing new.
The suggestion for an immediate
peace conference had already been
made to the allies in the note trans
mitted by Chancellor von Iietnmnnn
Hollweg or. Iec. 12. It was reject
ed by Premier Lloyd-Oeorpe in a
memorable speech in the house of
commons last week.
The Clerman reply was not re
leased for publication until too rate
for the eveniner papers of Tuesday
and the first editions of this morn
ing's papers. It was printed with
great prominence in the second edi
tions, however.
The Daily Mail take the view
that the note means nothing. The
"introduction to the text in the Daily
Mails is headed:
"German pence dodge."
In its comment the Daily Mall
says:
"If Pres't Wil?on meant, as r
eent American comment contend?,
that his note should force Germany
to state her terms. Germany hris
countered with this proposal so that
che can evade an r-rplicit m never."
The copy of the note was not re
ceived here from Herlin. but from
Xew York.
The Wilson note was under con
sideration by the imperial govern
ment in less than a week which
leads to an impression here rhat
Germany hiid mado up her mind i t
to give out her pcare terms even
before the Wilson note was received
in Berlin.
