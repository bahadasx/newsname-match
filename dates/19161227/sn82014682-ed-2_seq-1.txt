Board to Authoroize Investi

That now famous session of the
harbor board on December 20, when
Superintendent of Public Works
, Forbes and Contractor Ed Lord freely
passed the "short and ugly word" to-
wit, "lie" has a sequel this. after-
noon.. .
The harbor board has before it a
signed statement from J, C. Morgan,
territorial inspector, In whl;h Morgan
admits that he told a falsehood con
cerning conditions on Piers 8, 9 and
. 10 the bone cf contention at the De
cember 20 meeting.
And It was on Morgan's statement
concerning the condition of wall of
Pier 9 that Forbes had taken his stand
In direct contradiction to Lord of the
Lord-Young Engineering Company.
Lord maintained that the will had
1'ulged'out five Inches. Korlws denied
it. Later Forbes, MGrgan and -other
engineers of the cpartaie2; went to
" the pier under xjnxt.rtHticn and inves
tigated.. Forsei reiterated his (ieni&t.
Morgan now admits his own false
hood and tenders his resignation, but
" declare iiig belief that the pier is
rafe although it has. bulged.
Forbes left for i-'it; mainland yes
. Iprday. The Star-Bulletin ; learned
. , from members of . the harbor , board
this morning- that he was Informed of
MorgaaV admission "before - sailing.
t Morgan's statement Is dated Decern-
- Uer 24. Members, of the board hold
that Forbes ig, not to blame for the
io&itIon in which his department has
been put, and that he is the victim of
a lie told by an engineer he trusted.
Morgan's . statement- brings op a
new feature. It is this: r
The bulging Jn the wall was caused,
it is alleged, "by the. contractor put
ting In a soft hydraulic "fill" back or
f the wall before Its front was properly
lraced by cylinders and the "deck.'
Who is to blame for allowing the con
tractor to do this is a question still
to be discossed. though harbor board
t members do not hold the superinten
dent of works responsible.
Morgans falsehood is thought to be
the "result of making a blunder to
which he afterwards stuck, refusing
to admit a mistake. Just how he
made the original ; blunder is not
known.
Morgan's confession was made first
to Charles R. t Forbes, superintendent
" of public works, and Wilbur C. Wood
ward, assistant, being given orally to
them last Sunday. Later Morgan
wrote out his statement and the con
mission held an executive session last
night to consider It. It was decided
to have it -read tn the public meeting
this afternoon, the session being call-
ed ror 1:30 o clock.
Three prominent engineers will be
v -m appointed now to Judge the wharf, in
stead of a committee of two chosen
by the board and by the contractors.
. A member of the harbor board said
. . today: .-
."We do not believe the stability or
safety of the pier is menaced by this
bulge and we believe the movement
has stopped. Nevertheless, the board
Is spending public funds and we pro
pose' to have an entirely Impartial
body or expert engineers pass on the
subject. We shall get the three best
men available and let them make a
thorough- examination."
It is doubtful if Morgan's resigna
tion Mill be accepted more likely
that he will be discharged outright
from the employ of the territory. He
has been in service under the harbor
board for several j-ears.
The'letter read this afternoon bears
out contentions cf Ed Lord and his
assistants ror the past week to the
" effect that the wall of Pier S has
rone out in some places as much as
five inches. Morgan stoutly denied
( tnese contentions -face to face with
aJ lord's, head carpenter last Saturday,
' reading from his field book the fig
; ures which he now admits are untrue.
Engineer Morgan's statement, con
taining his resignation, is as follows:
-Honolulu, December 24, 1916.
"Hoard )l Harbor Commissioners,. Ter
ritory or Hawaii.
"Gentlemen: I must confess to vou
that I did not tell the truth when I
stated that the points on Pier 9 bulk
head were all true to center. There
is no doubt but what the bulkhead
worked sideways four or five inches.
"My weak exense for telling you
this untruth is the fact that Mr. Lord
informed the board that the bulkhead
" was out four or five inches just re
.j cently and only to discredit the de
sign and in an ntire spirit of animos
ity towards all men connected with

will be with the express understand
ing that these Chinese cannot enter

mation given to Circuit Judge Whit
ney a few months ago, he : told the
Star-Bulletin today. .
This information, says Judge Whit
ney, came from a man closely Iden
tified with the project to bring the
Chinese into the territory, and which
has progressed to the extent that
Farm Cornn, local Chinese business
man, already has left for Washington,
D. C'v. with a view to interesting offi
cials and congressmen in the plan
The!' man in .question was a passen

Judge Whitney returned to Honolulu
from bis annual vacation. '
Judge Whitney also was informed,
he says, that prominent Honolulu Chi
nese were the only people back of the
project In Jndge Whitney's opinion.
K is the plan of those supporting the
project to use the Chinese for pine
epple and sugar plantation work if
the necessary legislation permitting
their entrance is effected.
.Dr. Dai Yen Chang, who is closely
connected . with . this movement and
a personal friend of Farm Cornn,
said this morning that it is the plan
of the local Chinese, if the necessary
legislation is passed, to send com
missioners to China. These commis
sioners will have the power to select
the Chinese who will be sent and
only those thoroughly fit. both physi
cally and mentally, will be accepted.
It is not the Intention to bring the
entire 25,000 In at once, but only a
limited number each, year, not over
5000, according to Dr. Chang, v , ,
" 'iThe purpose of In-inging these Chi
nese into Hawaii is to supply labor
which Is greatly needed here," said
Dr. Chang. "The fact that they will
not be permitted to go to the states
Bnoulfl greatly aid our cause,'

given them to grow rice, which indus

said this morning that he thought tae
scheme a very, good one and one that
would go far to solve the labor prob
lems here. . .
Governor Pinkham, who has been
studying the Kauai railroad situation,
declared today that there is no govern
ment control over the wharf at Kealia
or the railroad which leads to Kapaa
from that town.
"There is no one in the government
that has any control of the wharf,"
says the governor. "The government
has not and never has had any agree
ment covering this stretch of traffic
between Kealia and Kapaa.
"The only agreements the govern
ment has affect the homesteaders of
Waipouli and South Olehena. The
governor has been trying for two
years to get a common carrier rail
road on that side of Kauai, as no com
mon carrier road exists there today.
The more feeling that is stirred up
over this trivial matter, the more dif
ficult it will be found to secure such a
road." .
Governor Pinkham took up his re
cent study of the railroad situation
on Kauai following a declaration by
Commissioner; James Wakefield in a
harbor board meeting that something
ought to be done to compel the Kapaa
Railway to haul freight for merchants
there.;. -V..-.

Superintendent of ? Public In
struction Considers Sug
gestion Well Taken
An editorial suggestion in Friday's
Star-Bulletin that selected groups of
California high school students be en
couraged to visit Hawaii in 191T or
1918 has the hearty approval of the
department of public instruction. The
suggestion was based on the success
ful trip just completed by students of
the Stockton High school.
"I most certainly indorse the Star
Bulletin's suggestion," says Henry W.
Kinney, superintendent of public in
struction. "I can see no objection,
and there could be nothing better, in
my mind, than getting Hawaiian stu
dents in closer touch - and in closer
relation with the students jof Califor
nia, or students in other states, for
that matter. ';. : '
"Any direct contact the . Hawaiian
students would get with mainland stu
dents would result in a great deal
of practical benefit . There are some
local students who have never ieit
this island, who have the idea that
the world begins at Diamond Head
and ends at- Moanalua, and for our
young people to get in touch with the
outside world would be . a splendid
thing. They would make friends and
it would be an incentive for them to
work harder."
Superintendent Kinney then recited
the story of the well-known Honolulu
man who had never left the confines
of Honolulu. On one occasion he went
to the Pali his first trip, to that
scenic spot. As he stood at the top
and gazed down into Kanebhe across
the great stretch of fields, he ex
claimed, "I had no-idea that the world
was as big as this"; V
One difficulty in arranging the pro
posed trips, says Kinney, is the idea
of having them in 'the summer. 'If
the students, come Yirring vacation,"
he says,- "there mkii'.be,, trouble in
getting local athletic teams together
and in effecting the Organization of
school children." 1 " t
But he adds that he has not the
slightest doubt that all difficulties
could be surmounted. School Inspec
tor George Raymond says, emphatic
ally, "By all means, let ns have these
mainland students come' to Hawaii."
AD CLUB I.V
TRUE DEMOCRACY
"Democracy goes farther than a
nation, i aid Rev. Charles F. Dole in
a talk before the members of the Ad
Club today at the Alexander Young
hoteL "Democracy is the biggest
thing in the world today. Nationalism
has been advocated much during the
past year, but the true democracy is
more than a party.
"Today a man leaves one country
for anotuer to seek his fortune, and
takes the oath in his new country.
No one blames him. It Is done for
convenience. He goes farther than na
tionalism. Democracy goes to the
heart It is brotherhood and loyalty.
Democracy goes back to a spiritual
foundation. It changes the attitude
of man 'oward'man. It does not ask
what is done for good roads or for
battleships but what is the method of
getting the be out of manhood.
"War jn. Europe today was caused
because the nations had become impe
rialistic. : It could not have happened
with a true democracy. The present
system of today invites fear, suspicion
eiid Is really autocratic. -Presiuent
Wilson could call v.ar at any moment,
which aives him the power of an em
peror in the United States. If I were
a younger man today the present sys
tem of conscription, would' aim to
make me work against my own con
venience. I would rather go to pris
on or to death than violate the prin
ciples, of true democracy.:
"Education today is debasing our
children. They are being educated to
think of war, creating a suspicion of
foreigners coming to our shores. It
causes Lb em to look with suspicion on
the foreign-bori population living in
this country. (ood will and brother

They are greater than a nation, and

Mrs. George Tackabury entertained .

which says. The United States is a

provement district and work can start
as soon as all legal steps are taken.
"The difference in cost between Circle
Drive and the Hawaii compromise Is
$4000 more for the latter, but as both
George Sherman and the Country Club
are donating $5000 between them, it
will really cost the county and prop
erty holders less," said Sutton.
