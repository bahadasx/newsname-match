Papers on Germany's Ready
Answer
. , (Associated- Press)
London, Dec. 27. -The prompt Ger
man answer to President Wilson's
note is characterized by evening pa
pers as evidence of Germany's eager
ness to end the war. The Standard
said it would be a mistake to neglect
''German peace maneuvers." . This
paper hoped the government would
courteously and definitely reply to the
president's note, and then "get on
with the war as energetically as pos
sible." The Pall 'Mall Gazette declar
ed Germany summarily dismissed the
invitation to state terms and said the
"most dignified course would be its
frank withdrawal." .

WILLIAM CROM ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE W ORLD
A friend of Mr. Wm. II. Crom, who
spent a number of his boyhood years
in this city, and who is now a lieu-
enant in the Philippine constabulary,
received the. following, which will be
of interest to all our readers:
Camp Andres, Sulu, Nov. 9, 1916.
Dear Friend: Just got your letter
of September 10th, and was very glad
to hear that you were still alive. It's
been over two years since I heard
fro many one in Ocala. David White,
of Citra, is stationed near here and
we get together once in a while and
compare letters. He hears from a
young lady about once in six months,
and that is all the Ocala news we get.
If you want to hear something
about this place, you won't be hard to
please for there is very little to tell.
Just at present I am the only white
man here. It consists of a long bar
racks built . of bamboo, in which
sleeps my company of sixty Filipinos
and Moros, a guard house, and my
own quarters, also of bamboo with a
thatched roof. The whole thing is
surrounded by a ten-foot barbed wire
ence with a sentry by the gate. About
two hundred yards off are the little
shacks where the families of the men
ive. The whole thing is in the bend
ot a river, the Tubig Puti (White
river), where the people bathe and
wash their clothes. The country
around is rolling hill country, with
very few trees and much tall grass.
All this is in the center of the eastern
end of the island of Jolo in the Pro
vince of Sulu. It is one of the most
southern of the Philippine Islands,, in
fact, we are only a short distance
from Borneo and Celebes. I am deputy
governor and everything else here and
my main job is to keep the Joloano
Moros from going on the warpath and
raising cain. It is only just recently
that this district has been quieted
down and there are still a few out
laws out now. They get in rifles and
ammunition from Borneo . and Singa
pore, old .Remingtons and Snyders,
and then get a band started and go to
looting the people. My business at
present is to hear about it before they
get a good start and clean them out.
I have had several nrettv eood fiehts
with different bands, and at present
there are only about a dozen outlaws
ii the district and only three or ,f our
guns. In addition to the rifles, these
hombres carry a long knife called a
barong that is sure some cutting
weapon. Three or four of the soldiers
have gotten cut at one time or an
other, and they can certainly make
some slashes in you. They also throw
big spears, but don't poison them,
thank goodness. I have a junior of
ficer, a man from Pennsylvania, who
is in the town of Jolo at present. He
is some company when he's here, for
this life is very lonely. Unless we go
to Jolo, we only see one white man a
month. He is the major, who inspects
the company monthly.
I spent most of August in Manila
on vacation leave, and had a greai
time. It is five days from here on a
steamer, but had pleasant company
both ways. While there I took the
examination for Uhe army, and think
. I will get it all right. So I may ge
into Mexico before very long, and see
what kind of fighters the greasers are
GREAT STORES OE
OIL AND GRAIN
In Central Rumania are Now Threat
ened by the Teutonic
Advance
(Associated Iress)
Except in Rumania, Egypt and on
the Tigris, military operations are
practically at a standstill. The Teu
tons reported new advances toward
Braila, the great Rumanian grain and
oil storehouse. Taking Filipechti
placed them within thirty miles of
this place. On the other side of the
Danube in Dobrudja the Teutons are
attacking the Machin bridgehead, al
most opposite Braila. The pushing of
the remaining Russians out of the
Dobrudja seems possible as a result
of these operations.
The artillery is active on the
Franco-Belgian front and the aviators
are busy. Some interesting develop
ments are indicated in the Verdun
region, where a heavy bombardment
east of the Meuse is reported by
Paris.

DANCING CLASSES
Miss Blair Woodrow's dancing
classes will meet at the Ocala House
parlors tomorrow; the class for chil

at 7:30. It
If they can bush-whack like the Jolo
anos can, they are going some. Thesa
people are Mohammedans, and think
the sure way to go to heaven1 is to kill
a Christian. If they can do that they
don't- care whether you kill them or
not. That makes them right liKe
fury when you get them cornered.
But if you can't get them in a tight
place they run. We have broken their
spirit as fafr as fighting goes for they
know thev can't eaual our better
weapons and discipline. We are arm
ed with the Krag carbine and the offi
cers carry a .45 Colt revolver. That
is the weapon that will stop any man,
Moro or not.
Write me all the news and how you
are making out, and remember me to
any of my old friends you happen to
meet. Continue to address the letters
to Manila, care headquarters, P. C,
as then they will be forwarded to me
wherever I go. Your old friend,
Bill Crom.
