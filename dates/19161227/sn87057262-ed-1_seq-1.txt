LAST MINUTE ABOUT UP
If Terms Are Not Agreed, Pershing's
Men Will Stick and National
Guards Remain on
Border,
[By Carl D. Groat, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Dec. 27.—The Unit
ed States government will await a
day or two for Carranza's answer on
the troop withdrawal protocol.
Though yesterday was the last day
of grace fci which he could sign, au
thorities explained today that trans
mission difficulties may have delayed
his reply. For that reason, they re
fused even to consider formulation of
any new Mexican policy untfl they
were certain he had Ignored it.
In fact, the general feeling still
was that Carranza would come to
terms in an eleventh hour message. If
he docs not, the American-Mexican
peace commission will be automatical
ly ended, although a formal session of
farewell would probably be necessary.
Then, according to views expressed
by army men. General Pershing's
forces will remain planted in Mexico
and the 75,000 guardsmen retained at
the border.
The prospect of failure of the con
"WretWfr'protocol, was far from pleas
ing, for authorities held it will mean
soner or later some fresh trouble such
as caused the border mobilization.

DETERMINED TO FIGHT

m.
[By Ed L. Keen, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
LONDON, Dec. 27.—The allies cer
tainly will not accept Germany's pro
posal in her note to America, for an
immediate pence conference. That
was entirely cltar today.
But the Teutonic reply to President
Wilson's note was hailed here as af
fording a splendid opportunity' for
England and her allies to set before
the world a statement which would
concretely epitomize the aims of tho
entene powers.
By her lack of sincere responsive
ness and the inconclusive nature of
her reply, England holds Germany is
self-convicted of lack of sincerity in
her peace proffers. Strong influences
were at work today urging thnt Great
Britain make this insincerity still
more striking by such a statement
of the entente's fighting principles.
The British public was impressed
by the fact that, despite what was
termed a lack of sincerity in moving
for a real peace, the suggestions in
Germany's reply nevertheless reveal
nn overwhelming desire for peace.
England attributes this anxiety for
cessation of war to Germany's reali
zation of her waning strength and her
desire to make peace now, when she
is yet strong. From now on, Britons
believe. Germany realizes her ene
mies will be waxing stronger while
she grows weaker.
Lloyd-George's plan for concentra
tion of all Englan's efforts for
war, meanwhile are continuing.
Tbe usual Christmas holidays tak
en by niembers of the ministry,
were overlooked by the Lloyd
George cabinet. Pursuant to the
promise made in his speech in com
mons, outlining the alms of the net*
government on December 19, tha
premier has isrued a call, through
the secretary of state, for the colo
nies, for a conference of the pre
miers of British dominions. This will
be held at the earliest practicable
moment.
In his recent speech Lloyd-George
said the premiers would be sum
moned "to take counsel with them
as to what further action we can
take together in order to achieve an
early and complete triumph for tha
ideals which they share with us.'
Editorial comment on the German
reply today was unanimous in re
garding its phrases as evasive.
"Germany has countered with thi*
proposal so she can evade an ex
plicit answer," said the Daily Mail.
