YOLUME XX
COLUMBIA, ADAIR COUNTY, KENTUCKY, WEDNESDAY; DECEMBER 27, 1916.
NUMBER 9
Start With the New Year.
Enterprise is required n order to
make a town grow and prosper. A
united effort upon the part of our
citizens and the judicious expenditure
of money would make Columbia grow,
and in a few years it would be a town
of dimentiohs, and every body who
make their homes here would be busy
from the rising of the sun to the set
ting'thereof. The towns in Kentucky
to-day that are prosperous are the
ones that have donated liberally to
enterprises which employ labor. Thus
it is and always will be, that where'
liberality is manifested towns thrive,
but where the close fisted disposition
is manifested, communities struggle
for existence. Men who have money
must invest it in order to protect their
own interest. A few small factories
in Columbia would furnish work for a
great many men, the town reaping the
benefit of the employees' earnings.
Visit a town where there is employ
ment for a number of mechanics and
also the day laborer, and see the stores,
especially on Saturday nights crowd
ed with customers from dark until a
late hour, the merchants receiving
hundreds of dollars nightly.
In older to see the advantage a town
reaps by having small factories, visit
Campbellsville and Lebanon.
We would be glad to see Columbia
start a move for the betterment, be
ginning early in the year 1917.
For Sale.
I have a good looking 8 year old, sad
dle and harness gelding for sale. A

Leaves for Illinois.
Mr. Howard A. Murrell and family,
who live at Craycraft, this county,
will leave for Champaign, 111., this
week, their future home Mr. Mur
rell was born and reared in the neigh
borhood he is leaving and has been a
good citizen all his life. His object
in leaving his native county is to be
close to his sons who located in Illinois
some years ago. He and his family
have the best wishes of their many
Adair county friends.
We do not know whether or not the
Municipal Board could be held re
sponsible in case of an accident, but
one thing certain, unless the concrete
walk from Mr. Sam Lewis' j)lace of
business to the corner where Mr. Bert
Epperson is located, is made rougher,
one is sure to occur. One man slip
ped and fell on this walk last Wed
nesday, but fortunately he was not
seriously hurt. It would not take but
a short time to hack it in a way to
keep persons' feet from slipping from
under them. If this is not done you
are going to hear of a leg or an arm
'being broken on this walk, and then
a suit for damages will follow.
Mr. Dan A. Hatcher, a young busi
ness man of Campbellsville, well
known in Columbia, and who has a
number of relatives in Adair county,
and Miss Carrie L. Savage, a popular
young lady of the same town, were
married in Louisville one day last
week. Since their return home they
have been very busy, receiving the
congratulations of their numerous
friends.
You can exchange your Prest-o-light
tank at BapidTransit Company's
office, and save money. The Company
also has a light -delivery truck for
sale. Will sell cheap if sold at once.

Mrs. Sam F. Eubank met with a
very painful accident one night last
week. She was grinding sausage meat
when the index finger of her left hand
got caught in the machine, cutting
off the end. A physician was called
who dressed the wound. The patient
suffered greatly for several hours.
After the first of January if you fail
to get The News you will know that
your name has been marked off the
subscription list. Persons who re
ceive "he paper must pay for it. Blank
paper Is too high to send The News
without compensation.
Evidently there will be a large
crowd in Columbia next Monday, the
first court of the year 1917. It isjust
as evident that a great many who will
be here are indebted to the News, and
It would suit us mighty well if they
would call and settle.
Mr. John Glasscock, who lost his
handsome residence, by fire, recently,
married an Adair county lady, his
wife being Miss Ella Dohoney before
her man age. The loss was about
$3,000,. no Insurance.
Mrs. Jane Corbln, who was the wife
ofm. Corbln, died near Purdy, a
few uays ago. "She was about forty
years old, and besides her husband
she leaves six or eight children.
An Enjoyable Evening.
Last Thursdayevening, beginning
at 7:15 o'clock, the Music and Expres
sion pupils of Miss Alice Walker and
Mrs. Ray .Montgomery delightfully en
tertained a lage audience at the G raded
School Gym.
The teachers are'known to be pro
ficient, hence their pupils -went upon
the stage, feeling confident, and with
out embarrassment. The playing and
reading ofall the pupils was an en
dorsement' of the teachers, that ex
pression being given by all present.
The following program was faultlessly
rendered:
"Diploma Waltz," (s i x hands,)
Misses Ca'rrie Grissom, Mabel Rosen
baum, Marshall Paull.
"Bed Fellow," Carrie Grissom
"Serenade Espaguale,'" Miss Mary
Summers.
"LaRusse," Miss Eva Walker.
"A Telephone Romance," Miss Mill
dred Walker.
"Military March," in which all en
gaged. "How La Rue Stakes Were Lost,"
Miss Alleene Montgomery.
"GaloD." Carrie Grissom. Mabel
Rosenbaum, Marshall Paull"
"The Christmas Star," Miss Kathe-
rine Netl.
"Arab Dance," (four hands.)
"Serenade," Miss Mildred Walker.

Besides teaching a school, the en
rollment being 500, in Portales, New
Mexico, Prof. "W. M. Wilson has a lit
tle time for chjcken raising. He writes
to Henry Hancock that he has some
fine ones. He took two premiums at
the State Fair and in the county show
quite a number. He likes his location
and says that himself and wife are
enjoying splendid health. Mrs Wil
son was not strong when she" left Co
lumbia, but the climate there has
built her up wonderfully. He and his
wife send their best regards to every
body. .
"The Elopement of Ellen," a play
given at the Graded School Gym, last
Monday night week, was a splendid
affair. Those who took part were
older pupils of the school, and they
were up on all the parts, the acting
being to perfection. MissEwen, one of
the teachers, arranged the play and
drilled the actors. Many compliments
have been passed on its production, as
many impressive points "were brought
out, both pathetic and amusing.

January American Magazine.
The most attractive feature about
the January American Magazine is
the leading article by Booth Tarking
ton called "Nlpskilllon's." It relates
some of Mr. Tarkingston's own opin
ions of drink founded upon his experi
ence and his knowledge of the experi
ence of men he has known well. Run
ning it a close second is "Why 'Mar
ried Men Are More Successful in Busi
ness Than Bachelors," which explains
the point suggested by the title. An
article on selling lusurance empha
sizes that to do business one must
know people. The fiction is most in
teresting, containing adventure and
love stories.

. Lattimore," Dec, 16, 1916.
Editor News:
On this month of yuletide, I here
with tender to all acquaintances and
friends, if 1 have any, the. compli
ments of the season. Ten years ago I
was in the hallowed precincts of the
"Old Kentucky Home;" but in that
time many changes have transpired.
In the first place the -fierce spirit
with the glass and scythe has taken
his remorseless toll, and many vacan
cies are in the ranks of people I once
knew. Among these may be men
tioned John R. Johnson, C. H. Mur
rell, Mrs. James Garnett, relict of
Judge Garnett, Dr. TJ. L. Taylor,
Ulysses Hurt, etc. Besides being call
ed to the spirit land, others have done
as I did folded their tents like the
Arab and silently stole away.
Carroll county, Mo., is pretty well
peopled with Kentuckians and their
descendents, many from Adair county.
Among these may -be mentioned Bram
White, my brother, George Frankum,
my neighbor, while Bob White, Oren
White and John White, also my broth
ers, have accumulated a grub-stake in
Carroll and departed for greener
fields and pastures new. Bram White
and George Frankum think Carroll
county good enough, and I say,
"Me
too." Also in Carroll county
are
found my esteemed friends, Tinker
Tom Taylor, Luther Wilmore, etc.
Mrs. M. E. Dohoney (nee Hurt,) lives
in New Mexico, and Mrs Bell Snow
Patterson in Oklahoma. Both of
these estimable ladies were products
of Tabor region, and were my school
mates in bygone days. Mrs Dohoney
was also my teacher; but doubtless is
not proud of her handiwork. Among
other Kentuckians who went to Mis
souri to grow up with the country'
were W. S. Hurt and R. s. Snow.
They and their wives respectively,
Corinna Snow and Bell Conover, were
products of Kentucky. Kentuckians
are a restless set. All formerly abused
that state, and classed it in "Poverty
Row " Yet it is'a good state if it
would take the public roads out of the
creeks, build better highways and
quit expecting the L. & N. RR.
Oompany to build a line through
Adair county. When you see Long
Bob Conoveriake hold of his boot
straps and lift himself over the Co
lumbia court-house, about then that
corporation will extend a branch line
through your region.
You people think too little of your
county and its possibilities. In North
Carolina, every man is a Solon Shingle,
and the same pride dwells in the bosom
of a native son of Missouri. Solon
Shingle boasted: 1(I fit in the Revolu
tion; likewise ray grandfather driv a
baggage wagon." In North Carolina
they boast that the rest of the world
is in outer darkness so far as vital and
undefiled religion is concerned; and
that they did about all the fighting in
the Revolution and the Southern Con
federacy. Also, that this state is the
home of oratory, the abiding place of
the muse; and that if Liberty ever
wings its' flight to other shores the
Genius of Freedom, exemplified by
the Old North State, will -make its
last stand in that sacred palladium
and weep over the shade of departed
grandeur. Kentucky is ridiculed for
giving every man a military title; but
here you can't throw a rock without
hitting a titled dignitary A singing
teacher, a saw mill man, a horse doc
tor or piano tuner, are all professors;
while editors, correspondents, lawyers
and county officers are decorated with
titles of major, colonel and captain.
Allow me to assure .Col. L. B. Hurt
that he does not outrank me; for I am
Col. Corn Cracker in newspaperdom.
Allow me to further state that I write
for papers of several states, and even
receive some veiy modest checks for
my contributions.
Missouri believes that Missouri will
first hear the trump of the Judgment
Archangel, and they are the saints
who will judge the earth. The people
there were surprised that I had seen
gang-plows, disc-Harrows, wheat
threshed by steam; or a farm .cultivat
or of any description. They seemed
to think we still cut wheat with a
sickle, plowed with steers and bnll
tongues, and cleaned wheat with the
obsolete "groundhog." twas coaxed
to go and see a steam thresher at work,
and told not to "be frightened at the
sight of an automobile. I had ridden
in a dozen or more Fords, Overfands
and Maxwells, and managed to pre
serve my .intrepidity in the presence
of a touring car.. In faet one of my
boys had one.
Allow me to say I voted fcr Wilson,
as did a majority of nearly 50,000 in
North Carolina. Cor Roosevelt car
ried the East for Wilson, while the
matchless Nebraskian, W. J. Bryan,
carried the West. During the sum"
mer, all the gold-bug clan, consisting
of bankers, manufacturers and other
trust magnates, who secretly hope for
Republican success but try to dom
inate the Democratic party, declared
"Old Bryan" a pestilent fellow and a
Married at the Parsonage. .
"Miss Cora Reynolds, an accomplish
ed daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. H.
Reynolds, of Garlin,. this county, and
Rev. J. W. Nelson, 'of Smithland, Ky ,
a graduate of the Lindsey- Wilson, and
who recently received the B. D. de
gree at Atlantar Ga , Emory Univerity,
were married at the home of Rev. L.
F. Piercy, by said minister, last Tues
day forenoon in the presence of a
few friends. The bride is one Adair's
best young ladies and she has many
friends. She recently returned from a
two year's stay, in the Missionary
Training School, Nashvilla, Tenn. The
couple will reside near Smithland, Ky.,
until the meeting of the next annual
Conference.
mover of sedition. Bryan and Wilson
had permitted the flag to be insulted,
and were pursuing a weak and vac
ilating policy. "Old Bryan" was go
ing to form some kind of. a hybrid
Democratic-Prohibition party and
help' defeat Wilson.- Bryan made
Wilson nominee at Baltimore, and
elected him in 1916. Roosevelt and
his "preparedness" ranters are not
fighting near so furiously as we were
led to expect, but is in the Figi Is
lands. Judging from some of his
tirades, he and his sons were dying to
enlist and wipe the stigma from the
"flag." nughes with his whiskers is
practicing law, and is not fighting
either. Should the occasion ever
arise to defend "Old Glory," the farm
ers, mechanics, teachers, etc., will
face the invader while war lqp will
make' money out of the "struggle.
That has been the history of all wars
in our country, and the future is to be
judged by the past. Tendering the
message of Tiny Tim to all Kentuck
ians whether at home or abroad;
"May God bless us evtiy one," I close.
