HALF MILLION IN
NEW ULM BUILDING
YEAR OF 1916 MAKES A GOOD
v. SHOWING IN IMPROVEMENT

MUNICPAL HEATING PLANT
HELPS TO BOOST TOTAL
FIGURES
Nearly half a million dollars have been
spepfi for building and public service im
_. Movements during the year 1916, which
JS now drawing to a close. The total
amount reported by the various con
tractors, city officials, etc., foots up to
$414,220. Besides there have been
numerous smaller jobs of work, including
many small buildings, and possibly some
residences built by day labor which have
escaped us, which will no doubt bring
the amount expended well near the half
million dollar mark.
Among the largest items are those of
•the municipal heating plant, the Weiser
building, the Becker block and the New
Ulm Rural Telephone Company's new
general offices.
On the whole the year 1916 has been a
prosperous one for New Ulm. The
following are the lists of improvements

MANY PROMINEN MEN
COMIN HER E JAN. 10
Mayor L. A. Fritsche has received
assurances that several prominent men
will be at the conference of the Tri-State
Flood Control Association, to be held in
New Ulm on Wednesday, January 10.
These will include Mayor Emmory of
Fargo, N D. Senator L. C. Spooner and
Sam. Y. Gordon of Minnesota. While
Governor Burnquist is not expected to
be here in person, owing to the fact that
the legislature will have hardly gotten
under way at Ynat time, when his
presence will be required in St. Paul, he
will be represented by some one of the
state officers, probably the state engineer.
Mayor Fritsche is anticipating:- a large
attendance of farmers and business men
from both valleys affected by the floods.
This especially is true, of the Minnesota
papers, published in the towns along the
Minnesota river have failed to notice
the fact that the -meeting is to be held
here nc-xt month.
'•'They certainly ought to be interest
ed," said the mayor. "Outside of the
New Ulm papers I haven't seen very
much said about the coming conference.
They certainly ought net to feel'that
if:h is a Nev/ affair. It is designed
to help a very large territory, and every
town along the Minnesota wili be bene
fitted."
SALESMANSHIP TALK
WILL BE GIVEN JAN
H. S. Mclntyre,
City Commercial Bulletin, wiil address
an audience at the Commercial Club,
on Friday evening January 5. His
subject will be: "Advertising and Sales
manship." It is expected that every
meichp.nt in New Ulm, and their clerks,
both men and women, will be present.
The Commercial Club has made special
efforts to secure the presence of.Mr. Mc
lntyre at that time, ,it is especially, de
sired that every person interested in the
selling-of any kind of goods be present.
In a letter to President Ottomeyer. of
the Commercial Club, Mr. Mclntyre
wishes it urderetord that then- is to
no fiight of oratory in his talk here,"
but that it will be just a plain discussion
on the subjects in which he is so deeply
interested. Mr. Mclntyre is an acknow
ledged authority on the subjects on
which he will talk to the New Ulm
business people, and he should be given
a hearing by a large audience.

the children of the turning classes. Over
300 children were present to greet Santa
Claus at Turner Hall and each one re
ceived a sack of candy, nuts and an
apple. A program of 20 numbers was
rendered. There were recitations, songs,
short plays and dance numbers, all well'

the program. After the regular pro

unqualified success, the little ones had

EXECUTORS OF PFENNINGER
ESTATE MUST PAY CASH
TO HEIRS.
ORDER OF LOCAL JUDGE IS
AFFIRMED HIGHEST
TRIBUNAL.
Last Friday the Supreme Court of the
state handed down several decisions
which are of general interest and one
which is of local interest. One defendant
convicted of murder in the first degree
is granted a new trial and Frederick T.
Price, convicted of the murder of his wife,
will have to spend the remainder of his
life in the state prison, the highest
tribunal having affirmed the decision of
the lower court in which he was convicted
of the crime of murder in the first degree.
In the appeal in the Jacob Pfenninger
estate from this county, Judge Olsen's
order directing the executors of the
estate to turn over to the residuary heirs
the sum of over $15,000 was affirmed by
the Supreme Court. A bootlegger is
granted a new trial, an anti-factory law
is held valid and a woman is granted a
divorce for cruel and inhuman treatment
altho no blows were struck.
New Trial for Solem.
Ole O. Solem, convicted in Jackson
county of the murder of his mother-in
law, Sigri Halderson, it being charged
that he gave her poison November 28,
1914, causing her death eight days later,
is awarded a new trial on his appeal to
the state' supreme court. The court
reverses the lower court after rinding
that, while the evidence sustains the
conclusion of the jury that the death was
caused by poison, it is insufficient to
sustain a finding that Solem administered

decision filed in district court yesterday
by Judge Molyneaux.
The decision Was filed in the case of
Simon Meyers against James G. Hough

purchased a site for' the building from
Mrs. Anna Louis Kling at 3353 Universi

already started the foundation for a flat
building. Mr. Meyers applied for a

to explain what the nature of the factory
