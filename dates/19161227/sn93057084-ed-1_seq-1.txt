The publishers of the Youth's
Companion are presenting, as
alwa3*s at this season of the
year, to every subscriber whose
subscription is paid for 1917, a
Calendar for the new year. It is
decidedly unusual, and strikingly
artistic. The colors are well cho
sen and richly blended. It was
made primarily, however, for
actual use, and is weil named the
Practical Home Calendar.
The wind break reduces the ve
locity of the wind and therefore
the loss of soil water from evapor
ation from the soil furface and
from the field crops. This is equi
valent to additional rainfall, just
as "a dollar saved is a dollar made."
It seems from investigation made
by the United States Forest ser
vice that the greater yields of
field crops and apples behind the
protection of a good windbreak
are enough to warrant every far
mer in the prairie states in plant
ing windbreaks.
A copy of the Christian Science
Monitor of Boston, Massachusetts,
for December 2, 1916 finds its way
to our desk with a marked article
headed
"The Suggestion of Dis
ease." The article is a protest
against the proposal on the part
of somebody (whom the Press has
not yet learned)to set apart the 6th
day. of Deoember of each year,
which it is proposed to have the
government designate as "Medical
Inspection Day." The Monitor
savs in regard to the scheme:
"What would inevitably follow
the exercise of such authority
would be a cyclone of fear, despair
and desperation, which would de
velop into a chronic condition of
disease, which would in turn sap
the vitality of theentire'nation."
(iTke
Fr. Vogel conducted the
celebration at the Catholic church
Monday evening. On account of
stormy weather, it was impossible
for anyone from Forest City to
attend
