*CARRANZA FAILS TO SEND
REPLY TO FEACE PROTOCOL
If Conference Fails Pershing and the
National Guard Will Remain
Along the Border.
(By United Presb)
Washington, Dec. 27.The United
States will wait a day or two for
Carranza's reply on the troop with
drawal proctocol. Yesterday was the
last day of grace he could sign.
Authorities explained that trans
mission difficulties may have some
thing to do with the delay, and for
that reason refuse to even consider
the formulation of a new Mexican
policy until certain Carranza has ig
nored it.
The general feeling
isatthat
ranza will come to terms1
Car-
the ele
enth hour. If not, the American
Mexican commission is automatically
ended.
According to views expressed by
army men, General Pershing's forces
will remain at the border and 75,000
guardsmen will be retained.
Failure of the peace conference
protocol would be far from pleasing
and the United States authorities
hold that sooner or later fresh
trouble will arise such as caused the
border demoralization.

NEGRO PROBLEM HAS
ATTENTION OF CHICAGO
(By United Press)
Chicago, Dec. 27.Rapid influx of
negroes here has created ,a problem
of importancejto Chicago today/ The
"colored population is"estimate at be
tween 40,000 and 75,000. The
"black belt" is rapidly widening.
Negroes have a "city within a city."
Considered of most importance in
connection with the situation is the
residence problem. The negro dis
trict has become a haven of vice,
driven from other parts of the city
by "cjean-up" orders. Negro boys
and girls are brought up in the midst
of immortality. Bawdy houses, gamb
ling dens, saloons* and other agents
of destruction have become estab
lished in the negro district.
Of Strang connection is the fact
that 137 years ago Jean Baptiste
Point De Sablo ,a Santo Domingo
free negro, built the first house on
the shores of Lake Michigan where
Chicago now spreads over a terri
tory of 198 square miles.

Now that the Christmas rush is

having received their presents, it
will not be amiss to state that Post

that can be bestowed upon him, and
his able assistants are also to be con
gratulated in the able manner in
which the heavy Christmas mail was
handled at the Bemidji postoffice.
The Christmas mail this year was
unusually heavy, the parcel post be
ing responsible. All day Sunday and
Christmas day a delivery crew was
out seeing to it that Christmas mail
was delivered. Any one at all fa
miliar with the interior condition of
the local postoffice are well aware of
the lack of facilities for handling
mail and the subsequent congestion,
but the difficult problem was solved
by Postmaster Ritchie and his assist
ants. Late trains* also added to the
discomfiture of the office employes.

Games Start Tomorrow
(By F. G. Neumeier)
Pioneer Correspondent
St. Paul, Minn., Dec. 27.The Bel
trami County Agricultural associa
tion, which holds an annual fair in
Bemidji, will receive $1,062.50 state
aid this* year. The association paid
out $1,500.35 in premiums in the
1916 fair and state apportionment
is made on a basis of 70 per cent of
the total premiums. Last year the
Beltrami county organization re
ceived $1,106 state aid.
Ninety-five Minnesota agricultural
societies share in the state appor
tionment this year. The premiums
totalled $122,308.34.
Among the large apportionments
are the following: St. Louis county
fair, Hibbing, premiums $1,604, ap
portionment $1,136 Hennepin coun
ty fair, Hopkins', premiums $1,463,
apportionment $1,036 Ramsey coun
ty fair, White Bear, premiums $1,-
179, apportionment $863.
The premiums of the Beltrami
county association are higher than
the average in the state.
Representative L. G. Pendergast
of Bemidji has arrived "on the job."
He has not committed his stand on
the speakership race, which will un
doubtedly be fought out on the floor
of the house. "Pendy" is to be com
mended for not pledging himself to
one candidate or other as the entire
race isi "up in the air" and nothing
is to be gained at this time by pledg
ing. There are more representatives
who have not pledged themselves
than there are who have pledged. C.
H. Warner of Aitkin has opened
headquarters in the Merchants' hotel
building and he has as good a chance
as any of the candidates for the
speakership.- A number of the sixth
district representatives* have pledged
themselves to Warner.
