would be much lose 1 n the expense

Resolution for Constitutional Ban on

Washington. Deo. 21.?Immediately
after the holidays advocates of pro?
hibition In congress plan to carry on
a vigorous campaign for the proposed
federal constitutional amendment and
to exert every possible effort to get
a vote on it at this session in spite
of the general belief that It will be
beaten.
The senate judiciary committee's
action today In voting to report the
amendment with a recommendation
for Its passage opened the way for the
resolution In both houses, the house
Judiciary committo having taken
similar action two weeks ago. In the
house It is proposed to appeal soon
after the Christmas recess to the
rules committee for a special rule to
bring the resolution-before the house
for a vote within a prescribed time.
Champions of the resolution In the
senate can resort to no such parlia?
mentary expedients and must take
their chance of getting the amend?
ment ahead of other legislation. Sen?
ator Sheppard, author of tho senate
resolution, will urgs its consideration
at every opportunity.
The senate committee amended the
wording of the resolution but Its ef?
fect is unchanged and would prohibit
the 'nanufacture, Importation and sale
of Lquor for beverage purposes in
the United States.
As reported by the senate commit?
tee the resolution would read:
"The sale, manufacture < r trans?
portation of intoxicating liquors with?
in, the importation thereof Into and
exportation thereof from the United
rStates and all territories subject to
th< Jurisdiction thereof for beverage

legislation. This article shall not be
construed to abridge the power of the
Ueveral States to enforce 8tate pru

Sven the most ardent advocates of
the amendment do not anticipate vic?

But they do expect an increased ma?

WILSON'S PEACE NOTE DOES NOT
< PORTEND ENTRANCE OF I
UNITED STATES |
INTO FIGHT.
Explanation of First Statement Gi^
out By Secretary Lansing Says
Note is Result of Critical Posltl
of American Reldtions With
of Belligerents.
Washington, Dec. 21.?Preside^
Wilson's note to the belligerents udj
ing discussion of peace was official!
interpreted today as not bearing m\
threat that the United States mig
bo forced to enter the war because
the continued Invasion of its rights}
the warring powers on both sides..)
This interpretation was made la
today by Secretary Lansing in'|
formal statement issued to overtaj
what were characterized as Wii
spread misconstructions placed i
one made carMer in the day sayi:
that because of the Increasingly crl
cal position of the United States aj
neutral, it was entitled to know es*
ly what each beligerent seeks in j
der that it might regulate its condt
for the future. 'jj
Seciotary Lansing's final stateme
formally prepared and issued after
had been called to the White Hej
for a conference with President l|
son, declared that he did not inti
to Intimate that the United States 1

of neutrality and that the whplej|
and language of the note were ?jm
flcient to Indicate its puroose wltlg
further comment on his pi rt. -3
Mr. Lansing's llrst statement, im
orally, of which no official copyt.1
distributed, led to exaggerations dt
language and purpose ihroughoraj
ficial Washington. Its most stnM
phrases, on which the widest ;jjp|
lation was based, were that the |
ted States was drawing nearlfifl
verge of war and that the sendMj
the note "will indicate the POSn|
of our being forced into the wajfl
that neither he nor President jH
regarded, the note "as a peac$
Secretary Lansing's #trt,s|ffc9
^reasons I for the sending'
the notes were as follows:
"It Isn't our material Interest we
had in mind when the note was sent
but more and more our own rights
are becoming involved by the bellig?
erents on both sides so that the sit?
uation is becoming increasingly, criti?
cal.
"I mean by that, that we are draw-*
ing nearer the verge of war ourselves
and therefore we are entitled to know
exactly what each belligerent seeks
in order that we may regulate our
conduct In the future.
"No nation had been sounded. No
consideration of the German over?
tures or of the speech of Lloyd
George was taken into account in
the formulation of the document. The
only thing the overtures did was to
delay to send it until Monday. Of
course the difficulties that face the
president were that it might bo con?
strued as a movement toward peace
and In aid of the German overtures.
He specifically denies that that was
the fact in the document itself."
Secretary Lansing also, said: "Tho
sendinR of this note will indicate the
possibility of our being forced into
the war. The possibility ought to
serve as a restraining and sobering
force safeguarding American rights.
It may also serve to force an earlier
conclusion of the war. Neither the
president nor myself regard this note
as a peace note; it is merely an effort
to get the belligerents to define the
end for which they are fighting."
When word of what the secretary'
had said spread throughout the cap?
ital It created the greatest consterna?
tion in ofllcial circles and among the
foreign diplomats, many of whom
were calling at the state department
to receive their copies of the note dis?
patched to their capitals.
It became apparent that the state?
ment was not fully approved at the
White House and that there was ques?
tion as to the wisdom of making any
comment that might be regarded as
an addition to the note. The White
House was concerned lest any word
reach the foreign capitals to be con?
strued as indicating that the Ameri?
can note was anything but what it in?
dicated on its face. So, after a con?
ference between President Wilson and
Secretary Irnsing, the second state?
ment was formally prepared and dis?
tributed at the state department.
Tt follows:

I -
London, Dec. 22.?The vigorous
prosecution of the war is the single
aim of England, King George declared
In proroguing parliament today. The
king's speech was as follows:
"The vigorous prosecution of the
war must be our single endeavor un?
til we vindicate the right so ruthla.vj
ly violated by our enemies and have
established the security of Europe on
a sure foundation. I am confident we
shall achieve a victorious confirma?
tion of the aims for which we entered

view grew that the United auu**
feared that unless'the peace proposals
go through now a period of ruthless
ness and retaliation may set in or.
both sides which will inevitably force
this oountry into action.
It is indicated therefore that the
allied diplomats will advise their gov?
ernments to view* the note in a friend?
ly spirit and go as far as possible to?
ward meeting the wishes of the
United States. No indication was
vouchsafed, however, as to whether
the replies will be identical 01 indi?
vidual in form or general or speciMc
in nature.
Secretary Lansing, in calling in the
diplomatic representatives of the bel?
ligerents, is understood to have made
it clear to them individually that Ihe
United States expected the replies of
their governments to be absolutely
frank in all details. The idea was
gathered that the United States was
looking forward to forming itsrjlf into
a clearing house for views and prob?
ably for terms.
The general understanding was
that the purpose of this explanation
wus to enable the envoys to com?
municate to their own governments
the underlying purpose of the presi?
dent's action at this time.
The opinion prevailed also that the
United States expected to be fully in?
formed of all terms, including those
relating to territory.
It is felt in various diplomatic
quarters that while statements re?
garding terms, especially those con?
cerning territory, might readily be
passed along by the United State-*,
they must not. if the negotiations are
to have the slightest chance of suc?
cess, be conveyed to the public gen?
erally. Should definite territorial
terms be made public, it is feared a
certain section of public opinion in
the countries affected would foment
additional embarrassment.
The world diplomatic crisis seemed
temporarily moved to Washington
during the day because of the presi?
dent's note, Secretary Irnsings com?
ment and the anxiety of the diplo?
matic corps to understand the Ameri?
can purpose. Ry noon all the rank?
ing diplomats from the belligerent
countries had called lit the State de?
partment, necessitating for the first
time in months extreme care to pre?
vent meetings between representatives
from hostile States.
The president's note was declared
today to be a ' hit mound the whole
circle' without intention of favoring
or condemning either beligcrcnt group
to the prejudice of the other. Never?
theless, certain facts ere cited as In?

TO PROPOSE NEW SYSTEM.
M?MASTER GIVES SUMMARY OF
BILLS TO BE PRESENTED TO
GENERAL* ASSEMBLY.
Insurance Commissioner to Pass
Rating Agreements Between Com?
panies?Building Code, Investiga?
tion of Fl. Causes, Qualifications
of Insurance Agents and Other Mat?
ters to Receive Legislative Atten?
tion.
Columbia, Dec. 21.?F. H. McMas
ter, insurance commissioner and chair?
man of the special commission yester?
day prepared a summary of the sev?
eral fire insurance laws to be propos?
ed to the general assembly.
The summary by Mr. McMaster fol?
lows:
"Tho letter of transmissal to the gov?
ernor sets forth the governing pur?
poses of the committee appointed by
him to study the fire insurance situ?
ation and to recommend fire insur?
ance laws. The several laws which
are recommended for enactment are
indicated in that letter. It may be
well enough for me to indicate con?
cisely the substance of these laws.
"The first is a building code pro?
posed to be enforced In all incorpo?
rated towns in the State. The code
proi>osed is similar to that already in
force in 40 odd towns in the State.
It is by no means so complex as that
in force in a number of the largest
towns, but is a simple code applicable
to the smallest municipality.
"The next law recommended is one
providing for the investigation of all
fires to determine the responsibility
for the fire. It has nothing .vhatever
to do with the insurance on property
but deals entirely with the causes of
fires and proposes to impose fines in
case of those guilty of criminal negli?
gence in causing a fire.
"The next law is one providing cer?
tain qualifications for fire insurance
agents. It will do much to eliminate
the irresponsible agent and its pur?
pose is to protect the intelligent agent
and at the same time prevent all
agents from over-insuring property
or from dealing unjustly with the in?
jured or with ^d^Aniea^ ..."
posal to the public is that of the rat?
ing law. The law proposed differs
from the Laney-Odom act in that
while this act prohibits compacts and
of this country as between the two
groups.
With the entente, apart from a lit?
tle trouble over Count Tarnowski, it
was pointed out, there has been no
published diplomatic correspondene*
for months. This country owes re
plies on both the blacklist, and the
mail seizures. Trade matters have
been very vexing, but have largely
been setteld out of court without
publicity.
Towards the central powers, how?
ever, particularly in the last month,
a decided feeling of tension has been
evident In the sending o1" about a do-S?
en inquiries on submarine linking*-,
followed by publication of th3 details
and also by the correspondence on
the Belgian deportations.
It became evident that it Is on the
sea it is feared this country may be
caught between conflicting belliger?
ent interests. Lloyd-George's state?
ments that all Uritish ships will be
nationalized, together with the ap?
parently official German decision to
treat such ships as liable to sinking
on sight, has led to the growing con?
viction that it Will be essential for
the safety of Americans, both pas?
sengers and sailors, to lay down some
flat distinctions as to what are pri?
vate ships and what are naval auxil?
iaries.
President Wilson today received R
telegram from Former Seeretar>
Bryan congratulating him on his note
to the heligerents. It said:
"You have rendered an invaluable
service to a war stricken world in
asking the belligerent nations to set
forth in specific terms the concession;
and assurances which they deem nec
essar.y to the establishment of a last
ng peace. It would be a reflection
upon the nations at war to doubt that
they know the ends for which they
are lighting or to assume that they
have any purpose which they are un?
willing to reveal.
"A definite statement by both sides
no mutter how far these statements
may be apart, will clear the air and
afford a basis for negotiations an<l
When negotiations begin they are not
likely b> terminate until an agreement
is reached, because neither side Will
consent to assume responsibility for
continuing the unspeakable horrors
of this conflict, if any reasonable terms
can be secured.
"Accept cordial congratulations and
my earnest wish for the BUCOSS of
the movement which you have had
the honor to inaugurate"

New York, Dec. 21.?Neariy $2,500,

ferers in Europe was pledged at a
great mass meeting in Carnegie hall
tonight. Jacob H. Schiff of this city
and Julius S. Rosenwald of Chicago,
headed the list with $100,000 each.
A total of $466,875 was subscribed by
40 persons.
The meeting was the first step in
a campaign undertaken by the Ameri?
can Jewish Central committee and the
People's Relief Committee to raise
$10,000,000 for war relief measures in
1917. The subscriptions received to?
night came from all parts of the
country.
Thousands of Jews who had not
been supplied with tickets surrounded
the hall before the doors were opened.
Rich and poor, old and young strug?
gled for admission. Prosperous busi?
ness men rubbed shoulders with strug?
gling immigrants. Women and girls
who had toiled all day in shops and
stores went dinnerlest; that they might
be on hand early.
The floor of the ha.l and the stage
were filled early by representative
Jews and their sympathizers in the
fund campaign.
MUST EXCHANGE IDEAS.
England Will Not Reply to Wilson
Note Until Views of Allies are
Known.
London, Dec. 22.?Chancellor A.
Bonar Law announced in the House
of Commons today that England could
not deal with President Wilson's note
until the government has had an op?
portunity to exchange ideas with her
allies.
does not clearly permit the coopera?
tion of the companies in re?sj||g|<j?
I the inspection and claasifh
law .pecifically permits
to establish rating bureaus and ehttT
into agreements concerning them, but
it requires that these agreements
shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the insurance commissioner and
open to public inspection'. It permits
perfect freedom on the part of the
companies in that no company is re?
quired to be a member of a rating bu?
reau. The principal of State super?
vision set forth in the Laney-Odom
act is continued in the proposed Pill
but by a different method. In the
proposed bill the insurance commis?
sioner is to act as an intermediary
between the companies and complain?
ants as to rates and only in case his
efforts should fail to bring about a
satifactory adjustment is the matter
referred \o a commission of five, two
appointed by the insurance interests,
two by the insurance commissioner
or the party interested, and one by
the government. This commission shall
have the right to review and pass
upon discriminatory and excessive or
unreasonable rates. The interests of
the local companies are particularly
safeguarded and it is hoped that their
growth will be encouraged.
"The commission without attempt?
ing to resulate the amount of mu?
nicipal license fees finds that the
great variation in license fees in the
municipalities of the State works in?
justice which is reflected in the rates
paid by the citizens. Therefore the
commission recommends that munici?
palities be required to fix their license
fees for irsuranee companies on a
fixed and invariable percentage basis.
This v ill be equitable to the small
company or to the new company just
entering ard attempting to establish
itself.
, "The commisson recommends the
repeal of the valued policy law, but in
its stead proposes an enactment
which will require the speedy settle?
ment of claims and the immediate
payment of such amount as the com?
pany will admit as just and proper,
leaving only the difference to be ad?
judicated.
"Another enactment proposed is
?ne makng the insurance commis?
sioner the sole attorney of insurance
compares to accept service in case of
uiits and providing means for this
process
"The bill does not represent the
ideas-nf any particular member of the
commission, The meetings of the com?
mission have been marked with har?
mony throughout. There has been
give and take and the bill is a com?
posite one representing what the nine
members of the committee believe to
be the best laws for enactment at the
present lime."
