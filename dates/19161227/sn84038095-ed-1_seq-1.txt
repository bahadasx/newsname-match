Begins Thursday, Dec. 28, Ends Sat* 30
Closing our most successful year in business. We will at this time hold probably the most
remarkable clearance sale we have ever had. If we operated merely on present market con
ditions we undoubtedly could not hold our usual pre-inventory sale, for bargains are very
scarce. Almost every kind of merchandise in our store has advanced, and when our present
stocks are sold we will have to pay more for the same goods, and often for goods that are
inferior in quality, Every newspaper tells you the story of rapidly advancing prices but we
are merchants,not speculators,and are here to give the best possible service to, our customers.
So for Thursday, Friday and Saturday of this week we will hold our regular Annual
Pre-lnventory Sale. Read the prices quoted in this advertisement and prepare to attend.

Austra-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey
today replied to the note of President
Wilson in which they asked that the
belligerent Rations state the alms for
which they were fighting. A proposal
is made by the central powers that a
conference of the delegates of all bel
ligerents be held immediately in a neu
tral city. The task of preventing fu-.
ture wars, the official statement says,
can be begun after the end of the pres
ent struggle. The answer which also
contains the reply of Austro Hungary,
Bulgaria and Turkey, "says:
"The high minded suggestion made
by the president of the United States
of America in order to create a basis
for the establishment of a lasting
peace has been received and consid
ered by the imperial government in
the friendly spirit which was expressed
in the president's communication.
"The president points out that which
lie has at heart and leaves open the
choice of road.
"To the imperial government, an im
mediate exchange of views seems to
be the most appropriate road in order
to reach the desired result.
"It begs, therefore,' in the sense of
the declaration made on December
12th, which offered a hand for peace
negotiations, to [propose an immediate
meeting tit delegates of the belliger
ent states at a neutral place.
"The imperial government Is also
of the opiniontthat the great work of
preventing further wars can be be
gun only after the end of the present
struggle of the nations.
"It will, when this moment shall
have come, be ready with pleasure to
collaborate entirely with the United
States in this exalted task."
The answer of the central powers
concludes with the usual diplomatic
terms of politeness.
