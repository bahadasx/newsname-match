SHOCK PROVES FATAL
TO PARENT OF SIMP
SON BOYS, KILLED AT
CROOK CANYON.
(From Tuesday's Dqily.l
The cycle of death which is hover
ing over the Simpson home was fur
ther enlarged yesterday when news
of the passing of the father of John
and Xclson Simpson, at Watts, Cal.,
was received here by a son, Thomas
Simpson.
The end was due to the shock
caused by the murder of his two sons
who were shot and killed at Crook
canyon a short time ago. The mother
of the two men slain is also nearing
the end of life's journey, and her
death is expected at any time. She
has reached her 85th year, while her
husband was over 97 years of age.
Advices received yesterday stated
that Mrs. Simpson's condition was so
serious after the death of her husband
that she was unable to attend the
funeral. Mr. Simpson will be favor-
ablv remembered as a resident of this
county up to about ten years ago, first
arriving in Prcscott on August 10,
1874. He left the country to seek a
change of climate for the health of
his wife, locating at Watts, Cal. Xot
withstanding their extreme age both
were benefitted, and when the sad
tidings of death came unexpectedly a
short time ago, both were prostrated.
The deceased during his many years
in this county, enjoyed a splendid
name among scores of acquaintances.
He was a useful citizen, a fine type
of the wholcsotilcd frontiersman and
a good man. He was born in En
gland, coming to the United States in
1849. He entered Arizona from Kan
sas, being a member of the famous
Callcn expedition. His w'fc accom
panied him and shared his privations
in early days. She desires now to
join him on the other side, and is con
tentedly awaiting the summons to go.

MUCH HANDLING; NO
EVIDENCE OF CROOKED
WORK UNCOVERED.
PHOEXIX, Dec. 25 A sensational
alarm was sounded last night by the
night watchers of the ballots in the
j library room of the court house, and
i Lcroy Ladd, private secretary to
Governor Hunt and Thomas Mad
dock, manager of the Campbell cam
paign, were summoned to the room
to investigate a report that ballots
had been tampered with.
The most serious discovery made
was that apparently the position of
the sacks containing the ballots had
been changed. The suspected sacks
were of Maricopa county, one of them
being from Precinct Xo. 1 of Phoenix
and the others from small outside
precincts.
Jeff Duncan and Harry Schade were
on the night watch and gave the alarm
about 10 (.'clock ui iilk.i.u The ifca!:?
on some of the sacks seemed to have
been broken, but from the manner in
which the sacks were scaled and the
frequent handling of them, there is
nothing suspicious about this, as
others have been fotind in the same
condition.
By instructions of Judge Stanford
a deputy clerk was instructed to re
place the seals, which was done in the
presence of several witnesses.
Max Gohccn and R. L. Little, who
arc on the Uay shift of guarding the
ballots say that there was nothing
whatever to create any sensation over,
or any suspicion that any one had
been tampering witli the ballots and
pointed out the practical impossibility:
for any one to do so.
The inspectors all observed Christ
mas today and the ballots arc rcpos-;
ing peacefully under the watchful
eyes of the guards awaiting the re
sumption of inspection tomorrow.

BODY IS FOUND NEAR
SIMMONS ON SUNDAY:
DEATH WAS DUE TO
NATURAL CAUSES.
(From Tuesday's Daily.)
The body of William Johnson was
found in a tent, within two miles of
the Stewart place in Williamson
valley, Sunday evening by Clarence
Stewart. Death had taken place
either that day or on Saturday night,
and was probably due to rheumatism
of the heart. An examination of the
body showed no marks of violence,
and the finding on the premises of a
sack of placer gold dust valued at
over $500, was convincing evidence
that death came from natural causes.
The deceased was a miner, and pre
viously had visited the Stewart place,
making known his identity and giving
information of where he came from
and why he was camping out in that
region. He had been on the Santa
Maria river placer mining but his ac
cumulation of gold dust was not given
publicity, neither did he dwell to any
extent on his pursuit, other than toj
state that he was from Kingman, and
was prospecting the country. His
outfit was exceptional for a prospect
or, consisting of a good tent, two
large burros, and an abundance of
food and clothing.
When first locating in that section,
Johnson informed Stewart that he was
in poor health from rheumatism. He
gave his age at 70 years. He also
mentioned the fact that he came out
of the. Santa Maria country a few
days before.
In going to the man's tent on Sun
day evening, Stewart stated his pur
pose was to greet the lonely prospect
or on Christmas Eve and to provide
him with a few edibles such as one of
this class would appreciate. The body
will be buried where it was found,
and under the circumstances attend
ing death, no inu'-st has been deemed
advisable.

THOUSANDS OF SACKS
OF MAIL HELD UP AT
TERMINAL POINTS.
CHICAGO, Dec. 25. Thousands of
sacks of first-class and parcel post
mail arc blockcded in the railroad ter
minals here. Coming from every di
rection in the country simultaneously,
the Christmas mail overwhelmed the
railroads, and deliveries arc said to be
four or five days behind. Outgoing
mail also is delayed. Every train
running out of Chicago has four or
five extra mail cars. Hundreds of
sacks were piled in the open sheds of
the railroad stations todav.
"Mail will lie from two to ten days
late throughout the country," said
Lcroy Stewart, head of the city deliv
ery division of the postofficc. "One
of the reasons for the great delay is
that nearly everybody mailed Christ
mas cards, in scaled envelopes this
year, i ticsc envelopes arc dcia ing
the delivery of package mail.
"It will take at least a week for
the postofficc and the railroad termin
als to dispose of the mail that is com
ing here. There are 50 wagons de
livering parcel post and it will take
the carriers all day to deliver the one
trip scheduled for today."
"The mail now in Chicago termin
als does not belong here," said Cap
tain E. L. West, superintendent of the
Middle West Railway Mail Service
division. "It is being transferred from
one railroad to another to be taken
to the different sections of the coun
try. I have called for more cars from
the railroads but th-y were unable to
supply them.
