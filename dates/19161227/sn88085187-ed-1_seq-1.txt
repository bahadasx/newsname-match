Two pullets owned by J. E. Bonnell of Tacoma,

The two birds have grown up side by side in
the intimacy of a small poultry yard. There is
only the difference of a week or so in their ages.
They were downy chicks together, keeping
each other company in the adventurous search
for bugs and worms, fighting over choice bits of

Ixiuis Bean, manager of the

Last winter The Times made an
open campnign demanding the In

The public service commission, in
its ruling last Juno, ordered the
rear ends of all cars ln Seattle
closed and heat installed.
Chairman Reynods at that time
declared the ruling would apply
to Tacoma as well as Seattle.
"We have Installed heating ap

Tacoina," declared Manager H*an.
"On the short haul lines we be

for It, and that It is not the best
thing for the health of the travel

Bean claimed that the ruling
was not made to apply to all lines.
He denied that the commission's
order applies to Tacoma as well
as Seattle. He declared, however,
that the T. R. & P. is providing
heat on all the new cars it puts
out, whether for service on long
haul or short haul lines.
The rear ends of all Tacoma
cars, he declares, have heen en
