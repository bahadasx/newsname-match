three months attempted j?. . ff -ct ani

I ?r. John It. Mott. one of i)i.- Artier
lean commissioners, conferred with
Secretary Lane during the day. and
both expressed the hop#- that Carranza's
reply would be favorable. The more
general opinion among Kovrnnvn'
officials, however, war- that the Mex
ican executive would not alter his re-'
peated declaration t'.iat.the American
troops must be withdrawn uncondition
ally. and that any Jurther discussion
of International subject* could not take
? place while foreign troops "violated the
sovereignty" of Mexico.
If Carratr/.a persiais in his refusal,
thftre will be nothing for the members
of tlx- joint commission to do but to
hold one last conference to clos-.- up
th^ record and siiv good-byes.
Luis Cabrera, chairman of the Mex
ican group. spent Christmas here, the
puest of Amlmssador-Designate Arre
ilondo, but was not in communication
with the American chairman, and re.
turned Inst night to New York for the
meeting with his colleagues to-day.

If a favorable answer finally is re
turned by <'arranza the conferences
will be resumed to discuss such sub
jects as the creation of an interna
tional court claims, the treutni' lit
of foreigners, sanitation by co-opera
tion of internal ion 11 forces, modifica
tions in neutrality laws and other
questions affecting the interests of the
two countries
Disruption of t}-. commission would,
it is believed, make very slim the
chances of '.'arranza obtaining a loan,
without which those high in his own
government concede it will be almost
impossible for him to continue the task
of conducting an administration beset
by organized bandies.
IIKXIKS THAT TMIlV I.IMIT
WAS IM T OX < A It It A \ y.A
NKW YORK, l.>ecember ? l.uis
Cabrera. chairman of the Mexican
delegation on the Mexican-American
Joint Commission, said here late to
night that no time limit had been
fixed for General Carranza either to
accept or reject the protocol proposed
by the Mexican-American conference at
Atlantic City. There was no under
standing during the session** of the
Joint commission, he added, which gave
the American commissioners authority
to impose such a time limit.
(ieneral ('arranza, Mr. Cabrera de
clared. would have ample time to con
sider what action he would take. Mr.
Cabrera said he was surprised when
informed that a reply was expected
by the United States government to
day. He asserted that he had intended
to take a vacation beginning to-mor
row, but that he had altered his plans,
and would remain here.
Mr. Cabrera said the relations be
j tween the I'nited States and Mexico
have not changed. "Remember," he
said, "that the next move is not Gen
eral Carrnnza's."
Questioned as to the significance of
this statement, Mr. Cabrera would give
no explanation. He said, however,
that he knew nothing concerning (Jen
eral Carranza's attitude toward the
American demand that he ratify or
repudiate ihc protocol.
When the Joint commission adjourned
in November, Mr. Cabrera added, the
understanding of the Mexican members
was that the joint commission would
meet on January 2. probably in New
York or Philadelphia.
Not one word, Mr. Cabrera declared,
had been said in the session of the
' commissioners concerning a loan to
Mexico. The call of the Mexican treas
urer upon hint in New York on Sun
day night was a social call only, he
declared.

The Times-I dspatch opened its

that it would open a way whereby the
more fortunate could give easily and
with little trouble to those who are in
need of clothe^ and bedding. It was
the first time that such an effort had :
been put forth, and the willingness ;
with which the people have answered

feel that its labor will not have been ;
in vain.

In other years collection of clothing
had been made personally by those con
nected with the charities association.
It was a long and tedious task, and the
expense was heavy. The deliveries
were few, and many who asked were
denied because there was nothing to
give them. By the present method of
collection and distribution it is hoped
that very few who call will lie turned
a way empty-handed.
As there is but one day left in which
to leave bundles at the fire stations, it
is hoped that there will be many de
liveries to-day. Ail packages should
be marked "For The Times-Dispatch"
so as to insure their proper distribu
tion. Hundreds of closets contain
cast-off clothing which can be made
very useful to those in need. It is not
a diflicult task to wrap up a few ir
inents and take them to the nearest
engine house. Everybody is asked to

Charges that the Eighth Ohio llegi

been properly cared for. set forth in a
"round robin" petition signed by mem
bers of the regiment, were answered
by the War Department to-day by
making public a report from Brigadier
Oeneral Bell, commanding the K1 I'aso
district, saying the regiment is com
fortably and adequately housed and
its number of sick is below the
average.
"Out of 9ii3 enlisted men and forty
six officers in the Eighth Ohio," the
statement says, "there ai'e twenty
three on the sick report at this date,
December 2(1. Only two deaths in
this regiment since arrival on the
border. One of these was a suicide,
and the other was Private I.app, who
died of pneumonia. Private i.app was
properly cared for and no blame at
tached to any one for his death.
"All tents of Eighth Ohio are floored
and walled and supplied with stoves
and ample fuel."

posal is made l?y the central powers
that a conference r?f the delegates of

I lie answer, whicii also contains iho
i reply of Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria
and Turkey, says:
"The iiigh-minded suggestion made
hy the President of the United States

for the establishment of a lasting pence
has been received and considered hy
tlio imperial government in the friend

"The Prv-sident points out that
which lie lias at heart, and leaves open
tin* rholro of road.
"lo the imperial government an Im
mediate exchange of views seems to
he die most appropriate road in order

the declaration made on December 1?
which offered ;l hand r..r peace negotia*-'
tioiiH, (o propose an immediate meet
ing of delegates of the belligerent
states at a neutral place.
the imperial government is also of
the opinion that the great work of
preventing future wars can be begun
only after the end of the present
struggle of the nations.
It will, when this moment shall
have come, be ready with pleasure to
collaborate entirely with the United
.states in this exalted task."
The answer of the central powers
concludes with the usual diplomatic
terms of politeness.

I lie Otllcial reply cannot state that
entente allies aim to bring the Turkish
! empire to an end in order to remove
forever German aims of world do
minion, or that (he allies will demand
reorganization of Austria-Hungary in
order to make impossible the fulfill
ment of German ideas regarding Cen
tral Ktiropc. which form the Hrst step
j <>f their program for world power.
I Diplomacy cannot suggest these terms
until the allies have laid the firm foun
dation for success of their present
military plans, lint by saying less,
diplomacy would acknowledge a result
of the war unsuccessful for the allies.
'Italy has not occupied Trieste,
France has not created a firm fron
tier along the Rhine, England has not
destroyed the Germ;in fleet, nor have
die allies as a whole succeeded in crip
pling (lie German land forces; and,
j therefore, (here are no guarantees for
the future in national relations which
will free the world from the oppres
sion of militarism."
Tile Koch says that even if Germany
should make tin unexpected conces
sion of relinquishing territorial gain
j and restoring ante-bellum condition.',
the aims of the allies would not be ftjl
filled, and (hat the only terms accept
able to Kussia would be those dictated
by herself and her allies.
