Farm Loans Bonds to be Is

Applicants.
fNORTH DAKOTA IN
SEVENTH DISTRICT
^Minnesota, Wisconsin and
Michigan Also In
cluded.
Washington, Dec. 27.—St. Paul.
Minn., has been chosen as one of the
locations of tho twelve federal, farm
loan banks.
The others will be located at
Springfield, Mass. Baltimore, Colum
bia, S. C., Louisville, New Orleans, St.
Louis, Omaha,. Wichita, Houston,
Berkeley, Cal., and Spokane.
North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan
and Wisconsin will comprise District
No. 7, and South Dakota, Iowa, Ne
braska and Wyoming district No. 8.
The banks will be established as
soon as is practicable. TTnder the law
each will have a capital of $750,000-
Applications for loans have been
pouring into the board in great vol
ume recently and it is estimated that
a sum more than 29 times in excess
of the combined capital stock could
be used in making loans.
Almost the first work of the banks
after approving and issuing of loans
will be the issuing of farm loan bonds,
a new form of security in this coun
try. The bonds will be Issued in de
nominations as small as $25, it is ex­|
pected, and will bear interest at a rate
of one per cent less than the interest
charged farmers on their loans.
What this Unrest rate will be has
not been definitely determined. It is
limited by law to a maximum of six
per cent. The expectation is that It
will not exceed .five and one-half per
cent at first and subsequently may be
lower.
*-Beads to-Protect All."
Loans on farm lands are limited to
Bp per cent value of the land -and mary
be payable, in from five to 40 years.
As fast as loans are made, bonds will
be issued to cover them so that at no
time under tho present plan will a
bank's entire capital be tied up in
loans to the detriment of other appli
cants.
One of the chief tasks now con
fronting the board is to find experi
enced employes for the new banks.
More than 6,000 applications for po
sitions have been received. The ap
pointees will be exempt from civil
service regulations, but the board in
tends to assemble experienced men.
Temporary Organizations.
The heads of the banks will be
designated as registrars. They proh
will be only residents of the dis
lcts involved and preferably attor
neys. The banks will be organized
temporarily by the appointment by
the board of five directors for each
bank, residents of the district in
which the bank is located- The direc
tors will select from among their
number the bank's officers. The capi
tal stock of each bank will be open to
public subscription for 30 days. If it
Is not entirely subscribed at the end
of that time, the government is au
thorized, under the law, to take the
unsubscribed amounts.
ibly
trlcts
Through a process of having bor
rowers subscribe in small amounts to
the capital stock, it is expected the
banks not long after beginning opera
tions virtually will be co-operative in
stitutions. The permanent organiza
tion of the bank provides for nine di
rectors, six of whom shall be select
ed by associations of farmer borrow
ers, the other three being appointed
by the federal board. The terms of
these directors will be three years and
they will elect officers from among
their number.
URGES BIG SUBMARINE
ELEETS TO PROTECT
AMERICA AGAINSTWAR
New iTork, Dec. 27.—Preparedness
for peace through the medium of the
highest scientific development of re
sources which would have to be em
ployed In a war of defense by this
nation was outlined today by George
F. Kuns, retiring vice president of
the section on social and economlo
science before delegates to the con
vention of the American Association
of the Advancement of Science.
Referring to the offensive power
of the submarine as shown in the war,
Mr. Kunz said:
"It behooves us to take time by the
forelock and to build a great num
ber of these powerful, though per
haps somewhat perfidious engines of
war. We should have at least two
fleets of 200 submarines, each to
guard our Atlantic and Pacific coasts
and the routes to the Panama danal.
One of the suggestions In the pre
paredness for peace program was
stated as follows:
"The entire population of the Uni
ted States could be card-catalogued
:and -the men classified according to
their various abilities or adaptation,
showing their fitness for the various
Evocations according to percentage-, up
to
1100.

Germany in Position to state
Specific Terms, it is
Said.
London, Dec. 27.—Communications
continue to pass between the capitals
of the entente allied nations regard
ing the reply to be made' to the peace
proposals of the central powers and
their allies. The answer has been
prepared in Paris and is now the sub
ject of discussion between the vfcrious
ministers.
It is unlikely any steps will be
taken by the entente with regard to
President Wilson's note until they
have dealt with the German pro
posals. It Is understood here that the
reply does not give specific terms, but
refers generally, to the objects of the
..allies.-...... /-I
Those pa rtlclpkll'rig" Tn "the' disSilS
sion speak .of-' thfl' difficulty of express
ing the" "general purposes in concrete
form so that the reply may be de
finitely responsive and at the same
time convey to neutral countries an
adequate idea of the alms and pur
poses for which the entente allles are
contending. The reason for not stat
ing the specific terms is said here
to be that the terms of the allies
largely, depend upon the extent of the
military victory which they confident
ly expect, and that any statement of
terms now would be -upon the existing
military and territorial situation
which tho German imperial chancel
lor clatms was based on a German
victory.. Therefore, it is held that
Germany is in a position to state her
terms, whereas the entente terms be
come definite when military successes
have been, achieved.

Field Marshal von Mackensen is

The taking of F'ilipechti placed von

other side of the Danube meanwhile
the Teutonic Dobrudja army, appar
ently comprising chiefly Bulgarian
troops, is hammering away at the
bridgehead of Matchin, almost direct
ly opposite Braila, The clearing of
the remaining Russians from Dob
rudja thus, seems a possibility not
only by a direct attack, but through
the advance in Wallachla, which, It It
succeeded in reaching 'Braila, would
be able to take the Matchin position
under artillery fire in flank and rear
from across the Danube.
On the Franco-Belgian front, the
artillery has been active in some sec

Pretense of German People
Falls Before Peace De
sires of Government.
London, Dec. 27.—The promptness
of the German .government's reply to
President Wilson's note Is character
ized by the evening newspapers tcav
as evidence of Germany's eagerness to
bring the war to an end.
The Standard says
"It would be a mistake to neglect
the German peace manoeuvers, but it
would be even more fatal to waste
time, over them. We trust the gov
ernment will give President Wilson a
perfectly courteous, but also a definite
reply and then go on with the war
as energetically as possible."
The Pall Mall Gazette says:'
"Germany has not been, slow to
seize the advantage given her by
President Wilson maladroit diplomacy.
It would be a real triumph for Ger
many to have herself recognized as
the wireless puller of the power
whose subjects her submarines drown
with impunity and which lectured her
in the name of all the cardinal vir
tues.
"The studied impartiality of the
American note surprised Germany
with a coat of white wash of which
she -was badly in need. The
allies win hold no discus
sion with an unpunished criminal or
with a power whose most Bolemn en
gagements are mere scraps of paper.
If Mr. Wilson's real object was to
elicit a plain statement of the alms
and terms of botf. sides, Berlin's
answer shows that he failed.
The Ill-conceived note has been frus
trated and the most dignified course
now would be In frank withdrawal."
The following la from the West
minister Gazette:
"For two or three days the pretense
was kept up that the American pro
posals were an unfriendly attempt to
snatch 'the prize of victory' from the
German people, but this clearly is not
at all the view of the German govern
ment, which sees in it a welcome op
portunity to improve the occasion and
at'the same time push forward its
own proposal for stopping the war."

There Is a carefully studied attitude

The view persisted in .Teutonio

til they, in reply to the note of the

fically requested terms. In German
circles here, it was considered more
probable that direct information on
the subject would be conveyed to
President Wilson through Ambassa
