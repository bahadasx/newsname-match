MID SKIES ARE SU6 HI
With skies smiling and the creak
and crackle of the frozen underfoot,
It seems that the great storm has
passed, particularly as the barometer
has risen to the clear and fair mark
on the Index.
There was greater precipitation at
Ooldfleld than here, while the Man
hattan summit had a fall of about
ten Inches.
Just before press hour this after
noon, F. M. Bruce of the Nevada-California
Power company got in touch
with the western slope of the White
mountains, where men are working
to disentangle the storm mesh. Mis
Information was that the power
"might" be on by 7 or 8 o'clock this
evening. Later he was told that only
there were only eight polos to be
set. The storm has subsided In the
White mountains.
The local situation is better than
was expected. A number of shafts
are failing up and some sinking
pumps are submerged, but the dam
