Makes Fortune From Potatoes.
Seldom has a fortune been reaped
off 160 acres of land in a single sea
son but William Brekke of Neils
ville is probably the only man in the
state of Minnesota who has per
formed that feat. Brekke owns 160
acres adjoining the villager-of Neils

he harvested 20,800 bushels of po
tatoes which he contracted at $1.15
a bushel. The gross income was
$23,920. The land averaged practic

FORMER WARREN BOY
DROWNED IN OREGON
Oliver Lundgren, Son of Mr. and
Mrs. Albert Lundgren, Former
Warren Residents, Loses Life in
River.He was a Student at Ore
gon Agricultural College, Cor
vallis.
Mary's river claimed a victim this
morning (Dec. 20) when Oliver
Lundgren and Troy Bogard, students
at O. A. attempted to bring a
canoe down the river from the dam.
The canoe capsized about thirty
yards below the dam and Bogard
succeeded in grabbing the canoe and
saving his life, but the other occu
pant went down and Bogard saw
him no more.
The young man who drowned is
the son of Mr. and Mrs. Albert
Lundgren 444 S. Eleventh street,
and was a junior in agriculture at
the College. He would have been 22
years old in January. His compan
ion lives at Woodburn, rooms in the
neighborhood where the Lundgrens
live and the two young men were
classmates and chums.
The two young men had planned
to go hunting on Saturday and ac
cording to the statement Lundgren
had made to his mother they plan
ned to ship the canoe to Monroe and
float down the Long Tom river and
shoot ducks. This morning Bogard
went to the Lundgren home and
asked if Oliver had a morning class
and was informed his chum's first
class would be at eleven o'clock, the
first period after the Convocation.
Bogard then suggested: "Let's go
get,that boat and bring it down the
river so we will be all ready for
Saturday."
They left the Lundgren home at
about nine o'clock and went to the
boathouse, took the boat out and
lifted it down around the dam.
They got in and had gone only a
few yards when the craft capsized
and the drowning resulted.
Bogard rushed to the house, near
the river there, and the accident was
phoned. The fire department was
fndtrhe baft-rung: in less%JkAz&&si
[than half an hour Chief Graha mJbeSMeas,^
with a dozen helpers were at the1
scene of the accident dragging the
river for the unfortunate man's
body. By noon the students had be
gun to learn of the accident and
this afternoon hundreds of people,
mostly students thronged the river*
banks near the place where the ac
cident occurred.
At two-thirty this afternoon Chief
Graham secured an auto truck and
took more boats to the place* that
more men may help to .drag the
river.. rr
The place where ihe canoe cap
sized is a' dangerous one* there* being
a whirl in the currerit which is swift
at the present time owitfg to the
fact that a moderate amount of
water is going over the dam. It is
the spot at which a college student
was drowned four years ago in this
same week cf the year. His name
was Williams and lived at Pasadena,
Calif.
The Lundgrens are newcomers in
Corvallis, coming here permanently
only last summer. They came to
this city from Puyallup/Wn.* where
Mr. Lundgren was engaged in farm
ing. Mrs. Lundgren came here a
year ago and kept house for her son
and daughter, both college students,
and during the past year Mr. Lund
gren sold out his interests in Wash
ington and moved here that all the
family might be togetherDaily

Obituary.
Saturday, Dec. 23, was the day
when the remains of Frank Gustaf
Johnson, an old settler of the Town
of Vega, was laid to rest in his last
resting place, the grave. It Was a
very cold day, yet the sun was shin
ing bright and the snow glittered in
its rays. The glitter resembled sil
ver pearls, and the squeaking noise
under the feet sounded like music
from on high, as the funeral proces
sion marched to the grave.
The little church on the plain was
draped in black and. white, and
green fir of the forest was strewed
over the floor. An able sermon was
pieached by the Rev. F. N. Ander
son) the pastor of the church, which
was very much appreciated by the
audience.
The pallbearers were Fred Swan
son, Chas. Johnson, Louis Ranstrom,
Aug. Ranstrom, Olof Bystrom and
Chas. Swenson. The organist, Miss
Mildred De Groessillier played the
funeral march, and Mr. Olof
Bystrom and Miss Emma Bystrom
sang a very appropriate duet.
A short biography of the deceased
reads as follows: Mr. Frank Gustaf
Johnson was born April 1, 1841, in
Algustboda, Kronoborgs, Lan,
Sweden, and died in the Town of
Vega, on the 21st day of December,
1916, at the age of 75 years, 8
months and 21 days. He came to
Red Wing from Sweden in 1868,
and from there to Warren in 1882.
He has always been a member of
the Swedish Lutheran church and
he has been a member of the church
in Vega since 1891. He was married
to Vendla Person in 1878 until May
8, 1915, when this happy marriage
wast dissolved by her death.
There is good reason to say, that,
from the time of her death, Mr.
Johnson's strength began to decline.
He lived only about 19 months after
herf They have both gone to a
~mor5e happy land, and are now par
takers of eternal bliss in heaven.
That we feel most assured of.
Their now living children are:
Mrs, John Abrahamson, Mrs. Chas.
Anderson, Miss Ida, Miss Rosie and
Mr, jArthuj? Johnson. Three brothers,
Sat number of other reT
atives and friends, both here and in
the old country, niourn the deceased.
Mr. Johnson has been a peaceful
nian and is deeply mourned by all
Who know him. Especially will he
be missed in the church, where dur
ing jhis life-time he was a regular
.M|enlan andj^faithful and devout
"He shall enter into peace they
^ift^Jtefit in their beds,, each one
.Mil in his uprightness." Isa.

Gasoline Explosions Becoming Num
erous in Smaller Towns.
Many garage fires from the smaller
towns and villages of Minnesota are
being reported, says Robert W. Har
gadine, state fire marshal.
Four men were injured, one pro
bably fatally, as a result of careless
placing of a barrel of gasoline in a
garage at Clinton last week.
Persons conducting garages are
evidently becoming careless and it
is important that the dangerous ele
ment in gasoline should never be
overlooked for an instant. The ab
sent-minded man who places a burn
ihg cigar or cigarette stub near a
barrel of gasoline, or who takes a
lighted lamp into a garage is taking*
his life in his hands and is also crim
inally negligent in relation to the
destruction of property.
Never take chances. Be sure the
gasoline tank even though it is out
side of the garage is perfectly tight,
and never, above all things, fail to?
observe the common rule of caution.
