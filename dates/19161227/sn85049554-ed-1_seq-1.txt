Wilson's Peace, Note Designated as
{'Maladroit Diplomacy."
Ldndon, D^c. 27. The promptness
of the German government's 'reply to
President Wilson's note is character
ized bythe evening newspapers as evi
dence of Germany's eagerness to bring
the war to aft end.
The Standard says:
"It"would be" a mistake 'to neglect
the German peace maneuvers, but it
would be even more fatal to waste
time over them. VVe hope the govern
ment w'H g've Prerfdeht Widson a
perfectly courteous but also a definite
reply and then go on with the war
as energetically as possible.'""-,
The Pall Mali Gazette says:
/Germany has not oten |low to see
the advantages giveh her by President
Wilson's maladroit diplomacy. It would
be a real triumph for Germany to hava
herself recognized as the wireless pull
er of the power whose subjects her
submarines drowAed with impunity
and which lectured -ber in the name of
all the cardinal virtues. It would
teach the' world that by letting the
Americans do the talking Germany un
derstands how to get her own way
finally in the sphere of practical poli
tics.

SAYS WAR |IIU«T GO ON.
Russia Thanks Wilson But Says Peace
Now Is Impoeeible.
Petrograd, Dec. 27.'— M. Pokrovski,
the RumIan foreign mlntoter.in an in
terview with representatives of the
press, discussed the three great ques
tions of the day—the German peace
proposals, President Wilson's note and
the attitude of ^Greece.
After recalling the reoent duma dec
larations in regard to the German peace
note, M. Pokrovski passed to the action
of President Wllibn., aaying Russia ap
preciated highly the food will and the
lofty, hunUme-mo^ves-of the presi
dent's note, but he declared it could
alter in no way the/political ijituation
created by "the falfie arid ^hypocritical
moves of the Berlin government."
Complete Refusal by Allies.
As the note coincided with the Ger
man proposals, he said, the ideas of the
Russian government in regard to Mr.
Wilson's action were alniost analogous
with thoae whlch had been set forth by
the Russian press, that is to say, Ahe
government's attitude in regard to both
question^ was one of complete refusal.,
NevertheleM, he said, the allied gov
ernments would reply with all -possible
fullness. Ttfey' would reiterate that
they would'continue the war until the
ravaged territories had been restored
and until there had been created a
state of affairs iti which the existence
of small nations woi|l4 be assured and
in whicb a new world-wide conflagra
tion would -be impossible.
Program of the Entente.' •••'*?.¥•
The foreign minister autiimarized the
program jot thci allief a* follows
First—There has bfen no chance in

Second—Thi minister declared with

Maokensen's Forces—Russians Prac­

While the peace discussions are
going on, active military, operations,
except in such remote fields as
those of Egypt and the Tigris, are
being pushed hard only on .the Rou
manian frotit.
In this war area the latest reports
show. Field Marshal von Macken
sen mflfting headway in advance
towards Braila, the great Rouirian
lan grain ahd oil storehouse on the
lower Danube.
The taking of Filipechti placed
yon Mackensen's forces a little
more than thirty miles from .this
point. On the other side of the
Danube,, however, the Teutonic
Dobrudja army, apparently com
prising chiefly Bulgarian troops, is
hammering away at the bridge head
of Matchin, almost directly opposite
Braila. The clearing of the remain
ing Russians from Dobrudja seems
a possibility not only by the direct
attack but thru the advance in
Wallachia, which, if it succeeded in
reaching Braila, would be able to
take the Matchin position, under
artillery lire in flank and rear from
across the Danube.
On Franco-Belgian fronts the ar
tillery has been active in some sec
tors and the aviators have been
busy, but the Infantry arm of the
service on both, sides is well in its
positions except for occasional
trench raids and patrol enterprises.
Some possible developments of in

tTun region, where a heavy bom
bardment east of the Meuse is re
ported by Paris.

Considered Local Needs.
"In determining the federal land
bank districts and the cities where
federal land banks shall be located,"
the announcement says. "The board
has given .careful*
.consideration to the
farm loan needs of the country. The
bo&d'-held public: hearH»6».v}n,' nfcujly.
all the statetc Every reasonable Op
portunity had been afforded cities to
furnish evidence to support their
claims as locations for federal land
banks More than seventy-five cities
applied to be designated as district
headquarters and were heard thru
committees.
"The banks will be established as
soon as practicable. Under the law
each will have a capital of $750,000.
Applications for loans have been pour
ing into the board and it Is estimated
that a »um more than twenty times in
excess of the combined capital stock
could be used in making loans."
To Issue Farm Loan Bonds.
Almost tho first work of the banks
after approving and issuing loans will
be the issuance of farm loan bonds, a
new
of security in this country.
The bonds will be issued in denomina
tions as small as *25, it is expected,
and will bear interest at a rate 1 per
cent less than the rate charged fanners
on their loans.
What this interest rate will be has
not been determined .as yet. It is lim
ited by law to a maximum of 6 per
cent. The expectation is that it will
not be more than 5V6 Per cent at first,
and afterwards may be lower.
Loans on farm land are limited by
law to 50 per cent of the value of the
land and are made payable in from
five to forty years. As fast as loans
are made bonds will be issued to cover
them so that at no time under this
plan will a bank's entire capital be tied
up in loans to the detriment of other
applicants.
Tp Create New Jobs.
One of the chief tasks now confront
ing the board is to find experienced
employes for the new banks. More
than 6,000 applications for positions
have been received. Tho appointments
will be exempt from the civil service
law, but the board will assemble a
corps of men experienced in banking.
The tytad of each uank wiii be calied
the registrar. They will be only resi
dents of the districts involved and
preferably attorneys.
The banks will be organized tempoi*
arily with the appointment of a board
of five directors for each one. Directors
shall be resident? of the district. The
directors will select from their number
the bank's officers. The capital stock
of each bank will be open to public
sutbscrlptioii for thirty days. If it is
not entirely subscribed at the end of
that time the government is authorized
under the law to take the unsubscribed
amount.
Thru a process of haying borrowers
subscribe in small amounts for the
stock, It Is oxpected the banks hot long
after beginning operation will be vir
tually co»operative institutions. The
permanent organization of the banks*
provides for nine directors, six of.
whom shall be selected by the assocla-,
tlOlw of fanner borrowers, the other
three being appointed by the federal
board. The tenia* of these men will be
three years and tney wiii elect officers
from among their number.

by the-secretary of the treasury. With
the inclusion of certain expenses over
looked by him in making this estimate,
the deficit will probably amount to
$300,000,000.
The democratic leaders Jn the house
are reported to be busy devising ways
•to meet the prospective deficit, and it
might be supposed that their first step
would be to curb the "pork" appetites
of some of their fellow congressmen.
But this does not appear to be the case.
Instead they are seriously consider
ing replacing the money which is to go
for' public buildings at crossroads in
the south and to improve southern
bayous by increasing the income sur
tax and the inheritance tax. By so
doing they can throw the larger por
tion of the burden of this southern pa
ternalism on the northern states, states
which by no means get their propor
tionate share of the "pork" barrel.
The three measures now on the ways
are the 935,000,000 omnibus public
buildings bill under which hamlets
thruoutrthe south, ^with posted receipts
of less than tlO.OOG, are paired oft
against populous northern cities the
flood reclamation bill, under which
MS.000.000 is appropriated to reclaim
16,000,000 acres of land along the Miss
issippi, in spite of grave doubts as to
the feasibility of the project, and a
river and harbor bill which looks now
as if it would reach at least $40,000,000.
The public buildings "pork bill" has
been reported to the house, and with it
a rule limiting debate on It to four
hours, otherwise known as a "gag
rule." The chairman of the committee
is Representative Clark of Florida.
The. flood reclamation bill has passed
the house and has been reported to the
senate by the committee on commerce.
Tlie chairman of this committee Is
Senator Fletcher, also of Florida.
The river and harbor bill Is being
framed In the 'house committee on
rivers and harbors. The chairman of
the committee is Representative Spark
man, also from Florida.

and for the other birth release."
He declared birth control was prac

classes of our native population in thei
Industrial and "Intensely civilized reg

hand, he said, excessive birth rate, "be-!
yond the ability of parents to support

to provide opportunities is one of the|
greatest evils that can befall a people.**
