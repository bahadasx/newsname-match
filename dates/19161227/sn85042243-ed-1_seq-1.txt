Totally Destroyed
FIREMEN
FIOHT AGAINST GALE
Loss Estimated at Approximately
$50,000 Fully Covered by
Insurance
Fire starting in the rear of the Bis­
marck commission plant* Seventh
street south and bordering on Main,
at 2 j'cloek this morning and still
burning at the noon hour, completely
destroyed that structure, the main
office and sheds of the Carpenter Lum­
ber company and the small warehouse
of Armour & Co., entailing a loss esti­
mated at rpproximately $50,000. The
area burned comprises a quarter of a
block.
Fight Blaze in iilizxard
Firemen in jackets of ice, moving
about as human icicles, fought the
lire under the driection of Chief
Thompson in a blizzard considered
the worst since 1896. A 35-mile an
hour gale raged at the time, threaten­
ing to carry the flames across the
track to the Occident Elevator com­
pany and to the Nortz Lumber yards
to the east. Had the two-story sash
and door structure, in the path of the
flames, taken blase, the other struc­
tures near by undoubtedly would have
been destroyed.
Four Lintf of Hose Run.
Four lines of-hose were run to the
scene, the streams being directed on
the sash and door building. As wat­
er lashed the building it froze almost
instantly preventing the flames from
the yards from taking a hold. This
morning the sash and door structure
looked as though a temporary ice pal­
ace had b,een erected by the firemen
to stave the flames in their drive
southeast. The coat of ice given this
building held the fire in its limits of
devastation, and was a remarkable
piece of work on the part of the fire­
men.
The origin of the blaze is not known
but, according to Night Captain Mar
tineson, first man on the scene after
the alarm had been turned in from
the oo passenger station, the flames
were first seen issuing from the rear
of the office of the Bismarck Commis­
sion company, of which W. S. Hughes
is the owner, and which is tycated
just south of the ^office of the Carpen­
ter Lumber company! Fanned by the
flale, the flames bucked the blizzard
and jumped the four-foot distance be­
tween the commission office and the
main office of the Lumber company
and soon had office building and yards
a seething furnace. Sweeping south­
eastward, the flames switched to the
ware-house on the rear of the Armour
& Co. building, destroying that struc­
ture, which was owned by the Bis­
marck Commission company but oc­
cupied by Armour. The main build­
ing of Armour & Co., located in the
middle of the block, facing Seventh
street, was badly scorched. The loss
to the warehouse and stock, consist­
ing of canned goods and merchandise,
was estiamted by W. C. Cashman,
manager of the Armour concern, to be
between $3,000 and $4,000, covered by
insurance.
Buildings All Insured.
The destroyed buildings, all of frame
construction, were well insured in the
H. T. Murphy Insurance company of
this city. The'loss placed on the F.
H. Carpenter, yards of which John A.
Larson of this city is the general man­
ager for this territory, and Homer
Spohn, the local manager, was esti­
mated at $20,000, ninety percent be­
ing covered by insurance, while the
loss on the structures and stock of
the Bismarck Commission plant was
placed at $25,000, fully blanketed. The
loss on the Armour & Co. warehouse
stock, the building owned by the Bis­
marck Commission company was be­
tween $3,000 and $4,000.
Slcies Aglow From Embers.
The fire, as it ravaged the shingles
and the finished lumber, afforded a
striking spectacle against the white­
ness of the blizzard. Burning embers
illuminated the heavens for several
hours. It was about 3 o'clock that the
fire was gotten under control. The
ruins continued to smoulder uptil
a late hour this afternoon.
Fire Chief Thompson stated this
morning that no alarm was turned in
to the department headquarters and
that the first knowledge the firemen
had of the blaze was the blowing of
the fire whistle. He then arose and
asked central where the fire was.
The new booster pumps installed
recently worked effectively in giving
a~lrtgfr piessure withwhiehto combat
the flames and the blizzard.

Bryan Says Wilson's Note
Opens Way to Conference
That Nations Can't Refuse
Time Is Ripe Writes Former Secretary of State for Substitution
of Love for Hatred. Signed Interview with Most Prominent
Pacifist of United States.
Editor's Note: Not necessarily The Tribune's views. It is,
however, an interesting viewpoint from the leader of the extreme
peace group in America.
By WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN
(Copyright, 1916, by the Newspaper Enterprise Association.)
The appeal which the president has just sent to all the belligerent na­
tions opens the way to negotiations.
sibility for continuing the conflict is
ON TOWARD RICH
He urges them to state in definite terms the conditions which they re­
gard as necessary to an enduring
peace. The request is reasonable and
cannot be refused.
It would be a reflection on the na­
tions at war to doubt that they them­
selves clearly understand just what it
is that they are fighing for or to as­
sume that they are seeking any ad­
vantages which 'they are unwilling to
avow.
Since, therefore, they know what
they are fighting for and have no se­
cret reasons for continuing the war
they will welcome the opportunity
which the president affords them to
present their respective sides.
While both sides will probably ask
for more than they expect to secure
they will recognize that from now on
the responsibility for a continuance of
the war will rest upon the side that
makes unreasonable demands.
All rulers have denied responsibility
for the beginning of the war and they
cannot fail to understand that respon­
stm
more cruel and more costly than anyone could have imagined beforehand.
All the other neutral nations will be glad to support the president's ef­
forts out of consideration for their own welfare as well as for humanitar­
ian reasons.
The peace conference when it assembles will furnish the representa­
tives of Christianity an opportunity to offer the philosophy of Christ in the
place of the philosophy of Pilate, the philosophy which is responsible for
the present war.
The nations of the world have built their hope of peace on their ability
to excite fear. They have tried to terrorjze each other into peace. They
-have allowed militarists to set up fa]se standards ot honor and to give a
threatening tone to their diplomacy. The time is. ripe for the substitution
of love for hatred and the spirit of co-operation for the spirit of combat, it
has been popular to argue that justice
the order in Christ's teachings.
"Love your enemies" was the law he proclaimed. Love comes first and
brings justice with it.

London, Dec. 27.—While the peace
discussions are in progress, active mil­
itary operations, except in such re­
mote fields as those of Egypt and the
Tigris, are being vigorously prosecut­
ed only on the Rumanian front.
Field Marshal von Mackensen is
making new headway in his advance
toward Braila, the great Rumanian
grain and oil storehouse on the lower
Danube. The taking of Filipechti plac­
ed Von Mackensen's forces little more
than 30 miles from his objective. On
the other side of the Danube, mean­
while the Teutonic Dobrurja army,
apparently comprising chiefly Bulgar­
ian troops, is hammering away at the
bridgeway of Matchin, almost opposite
Braila.
The clearing of the remaining Rus­
sians from Dobrudja thus seems a pos­
sibility not only by direct attacks but
through advance in Wallachia, which,
if it succeeded in reaching Braila,
would be able to take the Matchin po­
sition under artillery fire in flank and
rear from across the Danube.
Artillery Active.
On the Franco-Belgian front, artil­
lery has been active in some sectors,
and the aviators have been busy, but
the infantry arm of the service on
both sides is being held well to its
position, except for occasional trench
raids, and patrol enterprises. Some
possible developments of interest are
indicated from the Verdun region,
where a heavy bombardment east of
the Meuse, between the Vacherauille
and Vaux sectors, is reported by Paris.
Calm on all fronts was reported in
the official statement issued today.

El Paso. Dec. 27—That the object
of the present Villistas campaign in
Tampieo and that the bandit leader
is rapidly making preparation for an
attack upon that city, was reported to
United States departmental agents
here today. The report was not con­
firmed. Authorities, however, believe
that Villa holds Santa Rosalia Potesi,
cutting off communication with Tam­
pieo from the west. Officials further
believe that Villa plans to take Tam­
pieo because of its command of the
oil supply. Villa thinks that by cut­
ting off the British oil supply, he will
cause England to force the United
States immediately to intervene. It
has been thought for some time that
Villa sincerely. hopes to draw the
United States into a conflict. These
same officials thought that Villa will

(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 27—St. Paul,
Minn., has been chosen as one of the
locations for the 12 federal farm loan
banks. The others will be located at
Springfield, Mass., Baltimore, Md., Col­
umbia, S. C., Louisville, Ky., New Or­
leans, La., Omaha, Neb. Wichita, Kan.,
Houston, Tex., Berkeley, Cal., and Spo­
kane Wash.
There were one hundred forty dis­
appointed contesting cities.
Many Applications.
The banks will be established as
soon as it is practicable. Under the
law, each will have a capital stock of
$750,000. Applications for loans have
been pouring in to the board -In1 great
volumes recently, and it is estimated
that a sum more than twenty tifioes in
excess of the combined capitaj stock
could be used in making loans.1
Almost the first work of the banks
after approving and issuing loans will
be the issuance of farm loan bonds, a
new form of security in this country.
The bonds will be issued in denomi­
nations as small as $25, it is expected,
and will bear interest at a rate of one
per cent less than the interest charg­
ed the farmers on their loans.
Maximum is Six Percent.
What this interest rate will be has
not been definitely determined. It is
limited by law to a maximum of six
percent. The expectation is that it
will not exceed 5%. percent at first,
and subsequently may be lowered.
Loans on farm lands are limited to
50 percent of the value of the land,
and may be payable in from five to
40 years. As fast as the loans are
made, bonds will be issued to cover
them so that at no time under the
present plan will a bank's entire cap­
ital be tied up in loans to the detri­
ment of other applicants.
To Find Employes.
One of the chief tasks now confront­
ing the board is to find experienced
employes for the new banks. More
than 0,000 applications for the posi­
tions have been received. The ap­
pointments will be exempt from civil
service regulation, but the board in­
tends assembling experienced men.
The head of each bank will be desig­
nated as registrar. They possibly will
be only residents of the districts in
volved, and, and preferably attorneys.

PINCH OF VAR
(Associated Press.)
Copenhagen, Dec. 27.—Denmark,
like many other neutral countries, is
beginning to feel the pinch of the
war. Foodstuffs and fuel are becom­
ing scarce and the government has
been forced to take steps to conserve
supplies.
Kye bread, the usual bread of the
country, has since December 1, been
mixed with 10 per cent of barley, and
it
is bel|ev|d that the percentage
will
soon be raised to 20 per cent.
Plans are under way to regulate the
consumption and price of home-grown
sugar, by the issue of cards, each per­
son being allowed one pound a week.
Houses and flats arcscarce, owing
to the cessation of building made
necessary by the increased price of
materials. For some time past the
municipalities have been compelled
to find shelter for many houseless
families in school buildings and in
temporary structures.

Some Officials Fear Break With
Germany if Submarine War­

PROBABLE THAT SECOND
NOTE WILL BE SENT
Believed, However, That Teutons
Have Left Door Open for
Future Negotiations
(United Press)
Washington, Dec. 27.—Despite the
apparent loss of hope on account of
Germany's reply to President Wilson's
peace note, officials today did not look
for the threatening break with Ger­
many should the imperial government
be found guilty of pursuing an unre
lentless submarine warfare to the sac­
rificing of the best interests of Ger­
many.
Officials look upon the German note
in the spirit that the door is not clos
ed. With the help of neutrals, offi­
cials said, President Wilson can move
again. They took the view that the
president is now potentially a media­
tor and that he cannot quit unless
thrown down hard.
However, a high official said It was
planned to write only one more note
to Germany in event of peace negotia­
tions failing and the cause of the troii'
ble with America's rights not remov­
ed ehen, a break seems certain.
The view persisted in Teutonic quar
ters here today that Germany's reply
should be followed by highly confiden­
tial oral or written communication
concerning terms upon which the Cen­
tral Powers were willing to make
peace. The German embassy, which
repeatedly has made it clear that the
Central Powers were not likely to
make public their terms, had received
no official advices from Berlin today,
but definite information regarding the
intention of the Teutonic allies was
expected.
SWEDEN SENDS NOTE.

Sweden had addressed a peace note to

in forwarding the peace suggestion, a
sealed packages containing terms,
were the subject of much comment in
diplomatic quarters. The Rome re­
port has it that the packeages were
not to be opened and forwarded to Ger­
many's enemies, unless they, in reply
to the note of the Central Powers of
December 12, specifically request
terms. In German circles here it was
considered more probable that direct
information on the subject would be
sent to President Wilson.

London, Dec. 27.—A dispatch
from The Hague to the Exchsngs

man agents have arrived at The
Hague to make preliminary ar
rangements for German delegates
to the peace conference suggest­
ed in Germany's reply to the note
of President Wilson.
The dispatch reads as follows:
"In view of the preparatory
meeting of delegates to a peace
conference suggested in the Ger
man reply to President Wilson,
German agents have arrived at,
The Hague and are making in'
quiries for hotel accommodations
for German delegates."
(United Press)
London, Dec. 27.—The Entente al*
lies will certainly not accept President
Wilton's proposal for it peace confer­
ence.
This much became definitely. known
today. However, it was regarded that
this is a splendid opportunity for Eng1
land to set forth her alms in the war
in a statement that will go over the
entire world.
Suggestions in Germany's reply were
taken hero to indicate Germany's anx­
iety for peace. It was thought here
that Germany realized her waning
strength and that she sought peace
while she is yet on enemy territory. It
was thought here, too, that Germany
realizes that the Entente allies are
constantly growing stronger while she
is constantly growing weaker.
Continuing their program of concen­
trating the nation's strength, Lloyd
George's cabinet overlooked the
Christmas holidays and continued at
work.
Editorial comment hero today re­
garded Germany's reply as evasive.
Communications continued to pas£
between the capitals of the Entente al«
lied nations regarding the reply to ba
made to peace proposals of the CMi* i
tral powers and allies. The answer has
been prepared in Paris and is now the
subject of discussion between the Tar
lous ministers.
Objects of Allies.
It is unlikely any step will be taken
by the Entente with regard to Presi­
dent Wilson's note until they hare
dealt with the proposals. It is under­
stood here the reply does not give spe­
cific terms but refers to the objects of
the Allies.
Those partaking in the discussion
speak of the difficulties of expressing
the general purposes in concrete*form
so that the reply may be definitely re*
sponsive and at the same time conTey,
to neutral countries an adequate Idea
of the aim and purposes for which the
Allies are fighting.
Terms Not Known Yet.
The reason for not stating the spe­
cific terms is said to be that the terms
of the Allies largely depend upon the
extent of military victory which they
confidently expect, and that any state­
ment of terms now would be upon the
existing military and territorial situ­
ation, which the German imperial
chancellor said was the basis of a Ger­
man victory. Therefore, it is held*
that Germany is in a position to State
her terms, whereas the Entente terms
become definite when military success­
es have been achieved.
URGES PROMPT REPLY.
London, Dec. 27.—The promptness
of the German government reply to
President Wilson's note is characteris­
ed by the evening newspapers today
as evidence of Germany's eagerness to
bring th war to an end. The Stand*
ard says:
"It would be a mistake to neglect
the German peace maneuvers, but it
would be even more fatal to waste
time over them. We trust the govern­
ment will give President Wilson a per­
fectly courteous but also a definite re­
ply, and then go on with the war as
energetically as possible."
