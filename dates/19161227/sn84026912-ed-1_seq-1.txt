Two Anderson Young Ladies Deceiv
ed Quito Severe Injuries.
Blue Ridge passenger train No. 30
was wrecked last Thursday night
about four miles west of Pendleton.
Thirty-seven passengers were aboard,
most of whom were residents of An
derson and were returning to that
city. Sixteen of them were injured,
but none seriously. The train was
composed of an engine and two pas
senger coaches. The last car turned
completely over and fell across a
ditch.
Misses Helen Harris and frances
Anderson, both Anderson girls at
tending college in Georgia, received
tho most serious injuries. Miss Har
ris's nose was broken, her arm cut
and badly bruised. Miss Anderson
suffered a broken collar bono and
cuts about tho body. J. P, Stokes and
I. J. Harrell, both of Anderson, suf
fered sprained backs, were burt on
tho right hips and their arms hurt.
Tho train, it is said, was running
about 18 milos an hour, the regular
rate of speed, and was two hours
lato. All tho injured were taken to
Anderson on a special train, and
those injured, but not residents of
Andorson, wore taken to the Ander
son Hospita).
Owing to this wreck Walhalla was |
totally without railway accommoda
tion for the entire day Friday, the
only train roaching here coming in
about 6.15 in the evening. Travelers
waited impatiently for trains which
never came, and mail from country
points by auto and vehicle service
piled Into the Walhalla post
olllce along with Hie constant accu
mulation of boxes, packages and
bundles for dispatch by parcel post
until Postmaster Fant was swamped
-literally deluged in his own quar
ters-with an accumulation of mail
matter that ho could only sack up and
await opportunity to discharge when
a train could finally be gotten over
the lino.
It jrns at AT*, reported here that
spreading of the rails was the cause
of tho accident, but nothing definite
has been given out to establish or re
futo this theory.

w
1 came with Space, and hand in hand,
We two sat here alone,
As two twin Kings of equal might
Sit side by side athrone
While eons came, and eons went,
In ceaseless passing flight,
And all was still as dungeons deep,
And black as moonless night.
Then age by age-a million years
We watched the Sun take form,
While through the void in endless count,
The Stars were being born.
And then from out unfathomed Space,
We saw the world appear.
I shook my glass-and from it fell,
A Sand of Time-the first New Year.
The Years! I watched them come and go,
Till I could count no more,
The Old-the New-like falling rain,
Or sands upon a shore.
Through age of Mist, and age of storm,
And age of sweeping Flame,
Till last Man came with gift of speech.
And gave to me my Name.
Old Father Time, he calls me now,
As close 1 glean my tithe.
I walk the Earth with silent thread,
Yet ever sweep my Scythe.
Forever old, yet doomed to live,
I'd rest-but none ls here.
Again I raise my Glass and pour
Another Sand-a hew, New Year.

Columbia, Dec. 20.-Al the annual
mooting ol' the board ol' trustees ol'
donison College bold here to-day,
D'oe tuition was dollied 150 students
milking application for State aid.
Recommendation for such action
came from the Stale Hoard of Chari
ties ?nd Correction, lu which the
matter of free tuition at Slate insti
tutions was referred at the last ses
sion of tho State Legislature.
Tho board ordered the establish
ment of a boll weevil laboratory in
tho border counties of the State.
Work in this Held is to begin at once
and the services of two entomolo
gists will bo engaged.
More stringent action was nlso or
dered to attempt to eradicate all
forms of hazing at the school. The
board adopted a resolution requiring
that all applicants and their parents
shall sign, before tho students aro ad
mitted, statements that they will, af
ter admission, refrain from all forms
of hazing. Tho students further
agree to voluntarily withdraw from
Clemson when the. pledge has been
violated.
President Riggs was directed to
make application for Clemson's ad
mission to tho Resorve Officers'
Training Corps. Students electing
this advanced training course would
have extra military duties only in the
junior and senior years, and each
would draw a subsistence fee of $9
monthly and one complete uniform
outfit.
Beginning the third quarter of tho
school year, February ?1, all students
will pay S9 a month for board instead
of $X as previously.
Tho resignation ol' .1. N. Harper,
for eleven years director of the ex
periment station and dean of tho de
portment ol' agriculture, was accept
ed with sincere regret by the boa ni.
Tho board declined an offer I rom
tho Seaboard Air Line railway to ac
cept a site near Mi llee for the estab
lishment of the Saud Hill Experiment
Station. One reason was for lack ol'
Btlfllcicnt funds to develop this prop
erty, and another was thal bids from
all sources must bo sought by adver
Ising.
A bequest of $1,000 was received
from Mrs. Mary Cherry Doyle to cre
ate tho George Cherry Foundation.
This is to become a permanent loan
fund for worthy students from tho
(Md Pendleton District, in Oconee and
Anderson counties.
C. F. Shoflleld was selected as an
additional assistant in the depart
ment of fertilizer analysis.

terrille gale from the southwest drove

chimneys of the adobe shacks, it sont
the occupants Into the open air until
the tires in the grates could be ex
tinguished, the smoke cleared out and
the shelters rendered habitable.
Tents were flattened, adobe houses
and offices unroofed and kitchen
tires blown out.
Decause of the gale every man not
on guard was allowed to seek shelter
from the dust. Ordorlle.s sent out
with messages became lost in tho lim

walk a thousand yards. Travel with
out dust goggles, wrns impossible.
Hundreds of mon are hatless who,
not realizing tho force of tho wind,
ventured into tho opon only to soo
their head gear swept away over tho
mesa. The headquarters camp ap
peared as a great blur.

Although tho day was cloudless,
hardly a ray of sunlight pierced the

Most of the offices were lighted by
