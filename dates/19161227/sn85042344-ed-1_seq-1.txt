CARRANZA FAILS TO
PRESENT HIS REPLY
Officials Still Hope to Receive
Action on Protocol ; Com
mission Waiting.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. Altho
General Cnrrnnisa had not replied to
the demand of the I'nited States that
he either rutify or repudiate thf
protocol drawn by the Mexican-American
Joint commission, the expiration
of the time limit was not made tho
occasion for formally declaring the
negotiations at un end.
While the time expired at midnight,
officials wore Inclined to take Into I
consideration that a reply might have
been delayed and Indicated that a fa
vorable reply, even tho a day or mora
late, would not be rejected Inasmuch
as an adjustment of the intei national
difficulties was the chief object.
Next Step Problematical.

agreement under which American
troops would be withdrawn from Chi
huahua means tho closing of negotia
tions thru the Joint commission for
adjustment of the iiucstions at Issue
between the I'nited Sta'es and the de
facto government of Mexico. What
effect the new situation then present
oil would have on the policy of the
l imed States Is not known, hut it
was said at the state department to
day that any further move would be
made thru the usual channels and not
by the commission which for more
than three months attempted to fix
amicable settlement.
Confers With I.nnc.
lr. John It. Mott, one of tho Amor
lean commislsoners, conferred with
Secretary Lane during the day and
both expressed the hope that Car
ran.a's reply would be favorable. The
more general opinion among govern
ment officials, however, was that the
Mexican executive would not alter his
repeated declaration that the Ameri
can troops must be withdrawn uncon
ditionally and thul any further dis
cussion of international subjects could
not take place while foreign troops
"violated th sovereignty" of Mexico.
"If Carran.u persists in his refusal

Socialist "fair election law," claimed
by Republicans and Socialists to have

A similar prof ding will be taken
by the Socialists within the next few
dnys to have II. M. Sinclair, secretary
of the Socialist state organization as
the Socialist member of the bourd.
Tho law provided that tho state elec

Support Clark Solidly.
There Is no question about the
Deiiiocrots voting solidly for Speaker
Clark, but there are some signs of
strife among the Republicans. Repre
sentative Gardner already had an
nounced his opposition to Representa
tive Mann. Fverv effort will bo made
by leaders, however. to have the
solid support of Republicans assured
In conference before voting starts.
Itppresi illative Gardner who an
nounced yesterday that he would seek
to obtain a Republican conference
"to formulate policies'' for the future
activity of tho party In the house, did
not visit the n ii I a j today. Mr. Maim
was there, however, and tonight he
expressed the view thai the Republi
cans would stand united at least In the
organization of the house.
"I have nothing to sav about the
speakership matter or the Gardner
episode," except that I still hope that
the president may aid In bringing
about peace which shall bo lasting and
permanent and provide for disarma
ment and the removal of the heavy
burdens of military and naval pre

degree assist to bring about such a
result I would rather do that than to
bo speaker.
"The charge of Mr. C!ardnor that t

America first, last and till the time
and do not take sides in the Kuropean

Situation Inevitable.
"I suppose It Is Inevitable that In
tho present situation In regard to poli

who gets a grouch will bo tempted to
bluster around and say that lie will
not pluv unless ho can have his own
way. That Is always one of the results
of a very narrow margin of votes. Hut
in the end I think the Republic alls will

note is regarded here as having ad
vanced the peace movement another
step desplie ttie filet that It disap
points iii not mooting his suggestion
for an avowal of terms.
The reception Germany's reply re
ceives among tho entente allies whose
statesmen have publicly declared
against such a program now becomes
the point upon which a further move
Is hinged. The Gorman note probably
is the prelude to a series of carefully
considered delicate moves In the great
game of world diplomacy, all possibly
leading to an approach for a real dis
cussion of peaco terms on grounds
which all the belligerents inny foul
can place them ut no disadvantage.
Official Copy Not Received.
This Is the oflielul view of Ger
many's reply so far ns it has boon
formulated on the basis of the unof
ficial text. The official copy hud not
been received tonight and President
Wilson was keeping his mind open.
Neutral diplomatic quarter too re
garded the note us a step toward peace
and rather leaned to the view that
Girminy might follow it with a con
fidential communication of some sort
outlining In terms.
The view of the entente embassies
frankly expressed was that the nolo
was not an answer to President Wil
son's communication, hut rather a
d imeiit for circuliit ion in Germany
and In mutral countries with the ob
ject of moulding opinion to place the
rcspoi slbllity for continuing the war
on the entente. Among the Germanic
diplomats the only view expressed wus
one nf surprise that the reply preceded
receipt of tho entente's response to
Ccrmniiv's original pc-uee proposal of
December 12.

not beyond the realm of diplomacy,
however, to find a way to bridge that

regarded as a block to the negotia

difficult.
Germany's declaration that she re
