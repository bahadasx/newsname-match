Tucson. Arte, Dec. 27. Douglas, Bis

Slip of a coal shortage. The situation
at Douglas is serious, it was said. The
people of Bisbee are seriously alarmed.
Not a pound of coal can be had In
Douglas or Bisbee. The outlying towns
are suffering eeverelj". The poor are
resorting to wood, often burning their
household furniture.
Bisbee consumers accuse the rail
roads of causing the shortage. In a
telegram to the corporation commis
sion at Phoenix, they declared that
only 6 percent of the coal mined at
Gallup was escaping the hands of the
railroads and reached Bisbee. They
alleged coal for Bisbee was being
seized by the railroads or sent east.

War At A Glance
-IIILE the peace discussions
are proceeding, active
military operations, ex
cept in such remote fields as thote
of Egypt and the Tigris, are be
ing vigorously prosecuted only pn
the Rumanian front. In this war
area the latest reports tell of
field marshal von Mackensen
making new headway in his ad
vance toward Brailau. the great
Rumanian gram and oil store
house on the lower Danube.
The taking of Filipechti placed
von Mackensen's forces a little
more than 39 miles from this ob
jective. On the other side of the
Danube, meanwhile, the Teutonic
Dobrudja army, apparently com
prising chiefly Bulgarian troops,
is hammering away at the bridge
head of Matchln, almost dlrectly
opposite Brailau.
On the Franco-Belgian front the
artillery has been active in some
sectors and aviators have been
busy, but the infantry arm of tbe
service on both sides is being held
well to its positions, except for
occasional trench raids and patrol
enterprises. Some possible devel
opments of Interest are Indicated
from the Verdun region, wnere

Meuse. betwe 11 the Vacherauville
and Vaux sectors, is reported by
