Eagerness For End of War
in Suggestion of Germany
For Early Meeting
London, Dec. 27.—11.44 A. M. —A
uispatch from the Hague to the Ex
change Telegraph Company says Ger
man agents have arrived at the Hague !
to make preliminary arrangements 1
for German delegates to the peace |
conference suggested in the German |
reply to President Wilson's note. j
The dispatch follows:
"In view of the preparatory meet-1
ing of delegates to a peace conference
suggested in the German reply to
President Wilson, German agents j
have arrived at the Hague and are i
making inquiries for hotel accomo
dations for German delegates."
Although Reply Is
Unsatisfactory, Another Step
Toward Peace Is Seen
Washington, Dec. 27. Germany's j
reply to President Wilson's peace note j
had not been received here iji official j
form to-day and officials were reserv- j
ing their comment.
Despite the disappointment because I
Germany has not acceded to the 1
President's suggestion and laid down J
her terms the general view prevailed I
that the reply was another step for- |
ward in the peace movement.
The United States undoubtedly is i
expected by Germany to transmit* the J
sense of her reply to the entente bel
ligerents and the immediate outcome ;
depends upon whether the allies will
enter a conference before terms have !
been Jaid down. It was pointed out '
that the way ha<l not been closed <
, for Germany to lay down terms as the j
allies demand. In a diplomatic negoti
ation of such magnitude and scope of
ficials do not look for results to be im- 1
mediately apparent but expect the way :
to be paved carefully and slowly. The j
next move will not be determined un
til after the official text of the reply '
has been received. President Wilson
will discuss it thoroughly with the '
cabinet, probably Friday.

Little Rock, Ark., Dec. 27.—Reports
I to-day from central Arkansas which
! was swept by a tornado yesterday
j show that ten persons are known to
ibe dead and that a score of others
j may have lost their lives. Of the
i known dead, five are white and five
are negroes. Wire communication
i with parts of the district swept by the
storm, has been cut off and it may be
|a day or two before the exact num-
I ber of dead is known and the property
I loss established.
Much apprehension was felt here
to-day regarding the fate of the State
convict farm nt Tucker, southeast of
here, where 325 State prisoners were
at work. The farm was believed to
have been directly In the storm's path
and as all wire connection with it was
lost when the tornado first descended,
it was feared some of the convicts
might have escaped during the confu
sion. J. It. Burkett, warden of the
State penitentiary here, is on his way
to the farm with a strong detachment
of guards.
Passengers arriving here to-day
brought further reports of the wiping
out of a negro settlement at Keo, be
tween here and Tucker with a loss of
seventeen lives. Accurate information
on the situation there, however, is
lacking.

Maryland Reported Sinking
Nantucket, Mass., Dec. 27.—The
steamer Maryland, which reported bv
wireless on Christmas night that she
was sinking, had not been found to
day. The coast guard cutters Acush
net and Gresham, which had pro
ceeded from Woods Hole and Boston,
respectively, to the position approxi
mately 200 miles southeast of this
island where the Maryland sounded
her distress calls, sent word this
morning that they had found no trace
of the steamer. The cutters had
cruised in those waters for several
hours after it became known that the
vessel's wireless had been p.it out of
commission, evidently by a flood of
water which swept into the engine

"GLAZE STORM"
HITS THE CITY
tumbling Far From Lost Art;
Traffic Is Held
Up
The first "glaze storm" of the winter
!s here. It covered the trees, trolley
wires and pavements with ice. Toilers
, had some difficulty in getting to work
vhis morning. Tumbling was a feature
iof the day. The middle of the streets
was the safest place for walking
Itain started to fall last night and
with the temperature at 24 degrees the
pavements were soon sheets of ice
ice formed on the trolley wires and
held up traffic.
Warmer weather Is due with a prob
ability of rain to-morrow. Fair and
colder weather Is the forecast for
Thursday night. With , a continuation
or warm weather a break up of the Ice
on the river is expected. Present In
dications are that December will pass
out mildly. "
It Isn't Sleet Anymore,
Ice Storm and Glaze Instead
V ;' Sl^ nK, °, n \. V- C - Dec 27.—The
old-fashioned "sleet" is going out of
style this winter before the newer
ice storm" and "glaze," the Weather
Bureau officials reported to-day in
their campaign for more uccurate ter
minology for various kinds of frozen
rain. Sleet is officially described as
small globules of rain frozen before
striking the earth. When rain freezes
after fulling und forms a glassy cout-
Ing on the ground, trees and wires, the
condition is called a glaze, and when
this is severe and accompanied by
wind it Is reported as an Ice storm.
The Weather Bureau hopes to elimi
nate what it considers improper use of
the word "sleet," as it has caused sub
stitution of the term "tornado" for
• cyclone" when a violent storm of
small diameter Is meant.

SHULER TO GET
WINDSOR'S JOB
AS BOSS SLEUTH?
Both Mayor Meals and Bureau
Superintendent Amazedly
Deny Report
| WHO'S WHO IN POLICE
Adoption of New Rules Revives
Story of Schellias and
Lowery
Adoption yesterday by City Coun
cil, of the new police rules and regu
lations revived the rumor in city circles
that important changes in the official
personnel of the police department
are to be made early in the year.
Mayor E. S. Meals, however grln
ningly denied knowledge of any
"shake up."
The re-arrangement in the person
nel, so rumor had it, is that William
L. Windsor, Jr., superintendent of tha
detective bureau is to be succeeded as
head of the detective force by George
; W. Shuler, one of the subordinates.
Furthermore Paul Schelhas, so runs
'the report, is to be relegated to uni
, form and his place as a plain clothes
man is to be taken by Patrolman
Harry Lowery, one of the mayor's
latest appointees.
To all questions on the subject
Mayor Meals turned a smiling
answer.
"That's the one pipe dream I
hadn't heard of," said he.
"The new rules as adopted finally
yesterday settle for all time the ques
tion of who's who in authority at
police headquarters its Chelf of Po
lice J. Edward Wetzel."
For some time it is said there had
been wars and rumors of wars in tha
l department's official family, informal
j rows having begun as far back as
former Chief Zeil's administration. In
I the rules that were submitted by the
mayor, the authority and responsibil
ity for the police department head is
indisputably placed with the chief.
And this, so 'tis said, isn't to Super
intendent Windsor's liklng.He seemed
as equally surprised, however, as the
mayor when the question was put to
him.
"Now wl.ere on earth did that re
port originate," said . he in amaze
i ment. "Truly I'd heard nothing of
it! Yuh understand me?"
