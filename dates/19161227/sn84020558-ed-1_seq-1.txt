CARRANZA HAS
NOT REPLIED Tl
DEMAND OF 11 S.
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Dec. '26. Although
Guneral Carranza had not replied to
night to the demand of the United
States that he either ratify or repud
iate the protocol drawn ly the Mexican-American
joint commission, the
expiration of the time limit was not
made the occasion for formally (leclar
fnr the negotiations at an end. While
the time expired at midnight, officials
were inclined to take into considera
tion that a reply might have been oc
laye.i and indicated that a favorable
rep.y even though a day or more late
would not he rejected inasmuch as aii
adjustment of the international diffi
culties was the chief ohject.
Refusal to accept the terms -of the
agreement, under which American
troops would be withdrawn from Chi
huahua means the closing of negotia
tions through the Joint commission for
adjustment of the questions at issue
between the United States and the de
facto government of Mexico. What ef
fect the new situation then presented
v otfld have on the policy of the United
states is not known, hut it was said
at the state department today that any
juiuier move would l e maue through
itlie., usual channels and not by the
commission, which for more than three
jionihs attempted to effect amicable
feflllement. Dr. John R. Mott. one of
the American commissioners conferred
with Secretary Lansing during the day
and both expressed the hope that Car
ranza's reply would be favorable. The
more general opinion among govern
ment officials, however, was that the
Mexican executive would not alter his
declaration that American troops must
i e withdrawn unconditionally and that
any further discussion on internation
al subjects could not take place while
foreign troops violated the sovereignty
of Mexico.
If Carranza persists in his refusal,
there will be nothing for the members
ot the Joint commission to do but to
hold one last conference to close the
iiecorj and say goodbyes.
Luis Cabrera, chairman of the Mex
ican group, spent Christmas here, tne
cuest of Ambassador-designate Arre
londo, but was not in communication
with the American chairman and re
turned last night to New York for the
meeting with his colleagues today.
If a favorably answer finally is re
turned by Carranza. the conferences
will be resumed to discuss such sub
jects as the creation of an internation
al court of claims, the treatment of
foreigners, sanitation by cooperation
f international forces, modifications
in neutrality laws and other questions
affecting the interests of the two
countries.
Disruption of the commission would,
it is believed, make very slim the
chances of Carranza - obtaining an
American loan, without which those
'"' J 'n h's own council concede it
would be, almost impossible for him to
continue the task of conducting an ad
ministration beset by organized
ha.id'ts.
Says No Time Limit
NEW YiiRK. Dec. 28. Luis Cabrera.
T-hairnan of the Mexican delegation on
the Mexican American joint commis
sion, -said here late tonight that no
time limit had been fixed for General
'ananza., cither to accept or reject the
protocol proposed by the Mexicau
." mencan conference at Atlantic fit v.
N. .1. There was no understanding
during the sessions of tie joint com
mission, he added, which gave the
American commissioners authority to
impose such a time limit.
General Carr.xnza, Mr. Cabrera de
clared, would have ample time to con
sider what action he wo.ild take. Mr. !
abrera said he was surprised when
informed that a reply was exited ed by
the United States government today.
He asserted that he ha'i intended to
take a vacation beginning tomorrow,
tut that he hal altered his plans and
would remain here.
Uo to a late hour tonight, Mr. Ca
brera said lie had received no instruc
tions from General Carranza. The re
lations between the United States aru!
Mexico, he continued, are the same as
when the tentative agreement was
first signed by the commissioners at
Atlantic City.
"Remember," said Mr. Cabrera, "that
the next move in adjusting the rela
tions between this count:ry and Mexico
is not Genera! Carranza'.."
When the joint commission ad
journed in November, Mr. Cabrera
added, the understanding of the Mex
ican members was that the joint com
missi in wo, lid meet on January 9, in
nrohabp- New York or Philadelphia.
No word, Mr. brera declared, had
been received by. the commissioners
regarding the loan to Mexico.

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
EL PASO. Dec. 2fi. A reKrt Was
received here laie today by sources
known to be close to Francisco Villa
and by government agents, saying
that Villa"s forces captured San
Luis Potosi yesterday from the de
facto garrison. No ''etails or the
fight were given. Unusual interest
is attached to the report iere, be
cause of the fact that many of the
foreign population of Torreon, who
left there before Villa attacked, went
to San Luis Potosi.
San Luis I'otosi is southeast ot
Torreon on the National railroad line
between Aguas Calientes and T;-.m-jiieo.
Tampico is believed to be
Villa's objective in order to obtain' a
port through which he can import
arms, ammunition and supplies. Villa
was reported to be between Torreon
and Chihuahua City, and was said to
be preparing to launch an attack
against Chihuahua City soon.
In anticipation of this attach,. Gen
eral Francisco Marguia was reported
to have ordered General FYancisco
Gonzales, former commander in
Juarez, to proceed south at once with
his entire brigade to reinforce the
Chihuahua City garrison. General;
Murguia also requested all of the I
available troops from his brother, I
General Jose Murquia's command In
Juarez, to strengthen the forces at
the state capital.
A .Mexican who claimed to have de
"prte.i from the command of Mariano
Tamez, a colo.tel in Villa's army, ar
rived here today and paid Tamez
'.van east of Villa Ahumada, eighty
three miles south of Juarez with al
column of 4'io Villa followers. This I
force was believed to have been the
one reported to be operating south
of Juarez.
Tamez was a colonel in the Car
ranza garrison in Juarez at one time, j
and after planning a mutiny, left with;
a small force of his men and joined ',
Villa. 1

'The Teutonic allies are tavorable to
an immediate meeting of delegates
from the belligerent states at some
neutral point in order that exchange

This has been declared by the Ger

cent note of President Wilson suggest
ing that the belligerent nations make
krown their basis for peace. It is an
nounced in the note that Germany is
of the opinion that the work of pre
venting future wars can bo begun only
after the end of the present struggle,
but that then Germany will be ready
to collaborate with the United States
"in this exalted task."
Nothing has yet come through to in

is known, none of them has yet given

Reply to Wilson
BERLIN. Dec. 28. (via wireless to
Sayvillo) Germany and her allies
Austria-Hunpary. Bulgaria and Tur
key today replied to the note of Pres
ident Wilson in which he asked that
the belligerent nations state the aims
for which they were fighting. The pro
posal is made by the central powers
that a conference of the delegate of

in a neutral city. The task of prevent
ing future wars, the official statement
says, can be begun only after the end
of the present struggle.
Advances Feace Movement
WASHINGTON.' Dec. 2fi. Germa
ny's reply to President Wilson's note
is regarded here as having advanced
the pence movement another sten. de
spite the fact that it disappoints in not
meeting his suggestion for an avowal
of 'erms.
The reception Germany's reply re
eeives among the entente allies, whose
statesmen have pubiiclv declared
aga'nst such a program, now be
comes the point upon which a fur
ther move is hinged. The German
note orobablv is the prelude to a ser
ies of carefully considered delivate
moves in the great game of world di
plomacy, all nossiblv tending to an ap
proach nearer a discussion of peaca
terns on grounds which all the belli
gerents mav feel can place them at no
uisadvantuce.
Tiis is the official view of Germa
ny's reply so far a.; !t ha been formu
late J on the basis of the unofficial
text. The official cony his not been
received tonight and President Wilson
was keeping his mind open.
Neutral diplomatic quarters, too, re
garded the note as a step toward
oeace. and rather leaned to the view
that Germany might forward it with a
confidential communication ' of seme
Hort outlining her terms.
The vit-ws of the entente erabasnies.
fraiklv expressed. was that the note
was not an answer to President Wil
son's communication but rather a doc
ument for circulation In Gerir.any and
in reutral countries with the ob'ect of
moulding opinion to place the respon
sibility for continuing the war on the
entfnte. Among the Germanic dinlo
mats. Hie only view expressed was
one of surprise that the reply had pre
ceded receipt of the entente's respond
to Germany's original peace proposal
on December 12.
It was everywhere agreed that the
principal sticking point was the lack
of a definite statement of terms such
as President Wilson asked and such
as Lloyd George dec lared the allies
would require, if they were not to put
'Continued on Pace Five-)
est ti Iterances, fo far as they referred-to
the future relations between
nations," Dr. Mowinckel added, "were
similar to the statements in that
respect made by President Wilson
and Viscount Grey, the former Brit
ish foreign minister, and I there
fote hope that the possibility of find
ing a common basis for ntgot A-'ons
is not far distant"
From the recent speech of David
Lloyd -George, the British premier,
M. Mowinckel said he gained the
impression that the reply of the,
entente allies did not exclude further
peace discussions."

That T. V.. Campbell, member of

At the headquarters of the repub

tohold the inauguration between 10

but in addition to taking the formal

ably make a short address.
It is understood that the governor

contest the election,, remains silent
as to his plans relative to a mes

DRIVES TO GITY
Exhibiting a remarkable degree of
nerve, otto Glossbrenner, a young
German re.nch hand employed on the
Hartranft ranch south -of the city,
drove into the court house' yard shortly
before 12 o'efhek last night, stumbled
out of the buggy, staggered up to the
sheriff's office, where he collapsed. It
was discovered that he had been badly
wounded. '
He was brought to, and informed
the deputies that in an attempted
hold-up on South Central avenue, just
north of Riverside Park, he had re
fused to obey the command of "Hands
up," struck at his unknown assailants
with his whip and was shot in return.
Considering the size of the bullet
hole in Glossbrenner's right side, just
beneath the first rib, it was thought a
miracle by the deputies that he had
ever survived long enough to make
the ride to the court house. His wife,
who is in a delicate condition, was al
most a nervous wreck. She was taken
to a nearby rooming house. The young
husband exhibited more concern over
her than he did over his wound.
According to Glossbrenner's story, he
was driving south on Central avenue,
and as he came near Riverside he saw
two men standing near a fence corner.
They started towards the buggy, car
rying a flashlight and crying to him
to hold up his hands. He stated last
night that he thought it was a boy's
trick and paid no attention to the com
mand. As the footpads became in
sistent and started to run alongside
of the buggy, he realized that there
was something serious, and endeav
ored to defend himself and wife by
using his whip. He struck at one of
the men, breaking the whip. It was
after he had cut the hold-up man with
the whip that he received the shot.
It is thought, judging by the size of
the hole in Glossbrenner's side, that
the gun must have been about .38 cali
bre. Probably the only thing that
saved his life was the fact that he was
higher than the man who did the shoot-'
ing. The bullet struck just below the
first rib and traveled in an upward
direction. Dr. Hawley, who was called
to attend Glossbrenner, did not probe
for the piece of lead, and it was im
possible to tell where it rested.
He complained ot a numbness in the
arm. but outside of that he was suf
fering no pain.
After the wound had been dressed,
Glossbrenner, keeping his nerve as he
had from the start, put on Jiis clothes,
donned his hat and walked out to the
waiting machine without a murmur.
His clothes were covered with blood,
the bullet going through four layers
of clothing.
As Glossbrenner could give no de
scription tf the hold-up men. it was
impossible owing to the darkness last
night to take up the trail. Deputies
will be on hand early this morning,
though, to attempt to trail the thugs.
