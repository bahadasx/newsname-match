Not Give l"p Vntil All His Ideas
Are Thrown Down Hard.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 27. Despite
the feeling of hopelessness of govern
ment officials over the prospects or
peace, men close to President Wilson
believe he will try his utmost to pre
vent the situation getting beyond his
grasp. Two reasons actuate him. The
desire to end the war. and to avoid
having to put through the Sussex note
threat of a break in relations with
Germany should she overstep her sub
marine pledges.
They made no secret of their pes
simism over the allied rejection of the
German proposal. Wilson's friends
hold that he has placed himself In the
position of potential mediator and can
not quit unless his ideas are thrown
down hard.
An official told the United Press
that present plans call for no more
note writing to Germany. He added if
the Marina. Arabia and otherss de
velop a clear cut violation of the
pledge given in the Sussex case, or
Germany starts new submarining in

answer.
