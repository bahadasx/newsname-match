SWEDEN JoTnSUN PLEAS
United States Will Transmit
Reply" of Berlin to the
', Entente Powers.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 27. Official
information hat been received here that
Sweden has addressed "a peace note to
the belligerents and sent copies to neu
tral! urging consideration of terms for
peace.
Official Copy Not Received.
Germany's reply to President Wil
son's peace note had not been received
here in official form early today and
officials were reserving their comment
until they had opportunity to study it
Despite the- disappointment because
Germany has not acceded to the presi
dent's suggestion and laid down her
terms, the general view prevailed that
the reply was .another step forward in
the peace movement because it left
room for .subsequent negotiations.
Not Not RacWved.
Secretary Lansing said in rrtfronse to
questions today that such a note had
not reached the state department and
he had no knowledge of its having been
dispatched.
The advices received here said the
note had already been delivered in some
of the belligerent capitals and that it
much resembled the note which ex
pressed Indorsement of President Vil
son's note. There were no indications
to show what Spain intends doing.
Expected to Forward Reply.
The United States undoubtedly is
expected by Germany to transmit the
sense of her reply to the entente bel
ligerents and the immediate outcome
depends on whether the allies will
modify their determination not to en
ter a conference before terms have
been laid down. It was pointed out
that the way had not been closed to
Germany to lay down her own terms
as the allies demand. In a diplomatic

'SLEETS' ARE OUT
OF STYLE; 'GLAZE'
OR 'ICEST0RM' NOW
WASHINGTON. Dec. 27-The
old-fashioned "sleet" is going
out of style this winter be
fore the newer 'Ve storm" and
"glare," weather bureau officials re
ported t"day in tlieir campion for
more accurate terminology for va
rious kinds of froren rain. Sleet
is officially described as small lo
bules of rain frnen before striking
the earth. When rain freeres after
falling and forms a glassy coating
on the ground, trees and wires, the
condition is called a glare and when
this is severe and accompanied by
wind it is reported as an ice storm.
The weather bureau hopes to elimi
nate what it coiiMilrri improper use
of the word sleet as it has caused
substitution of the term "tornado"
for "cyclone." when a violent storm
of small diameter ii meant.
GOVERNOR SAYS
STATE CAPITOL
WILL BE READY
State's Executive Inspects the
( Building Tfxfciy,
Snags in the way of carrying out
the plan suggested by some memlers
of the legislature to meet on January
2 and take a recess until June or July
on account of the unfinished condi
tion of the state capitol began to loom
up today when state officials began a
close study of the effect of carrying
out such a plan.
Probably the most serious obstacle
was pointed out by State Auditor E. B.
Howard, that being the constitutional
provision requiring that Jhe state VsrVd
of erjualiration shall meet on the third
Monday in June and make the levy
for the current year.
Unable to Tlx Levy.
Unless the legislature has met pre
viously to the meetinir of the board and
made the necessary appropriations, the
state hoard of equalisation would have
Mo way of knowing the amount of
taojiey to be raited by direct taxation
and consequently would be unable to
make the levy.
Should the work of the equaliration
board be delaved it would probably re
sult in confusion in carrying out taxa
tion matters in the different counties,
it was said.
"The work is coming along in fine
shape and I can now see no reason
why the meeting cannot be held in the
new capitol." said Governor Williams
this morning after returning from the
capitol, where accompanied by members
of the state board of affairs he made
a thorough inspection of the building

Disappointed, but Feel That

Forming of Districts Difficult
Problem, Says Carl Wil

Members of the local farm loan bank
committee, though disapointed at the
action ot the federal board in not choos
ingthis city, declared today that Wich
ita is a good selection for the bank of
the district as composed, and perhaps
more conveniently located, insofar as
Oklahoma was concerned, of any othe:
city in the district except Oklahoma
City.
Board Sincere.
"It is naturally a matter of the keen
est regret that Oklahoma City has not
been rlesignated as the location for one
of the federal land banks, for it seemed
to the members of the committee that
this city is the logical place for one of
them," said James Chenoweth, chairman
of the local land bank committee.
"However, acquaintanceship with the
members of the board formed on the
date of the hearing in Oklahoma City
convinces us that the 'board has token
the action which it conscientiously
thought best to take. Wichita is to be
congratulated upon having been se
lected and we feel that Oklahoma City
will continue to growand develop in
commercial importance even though the
federal land bank goes elsewhere.
Work Thorough. (
"The committee feels that it is only
due the people of Oklahoma City and
the state at large to say that in its
opinion everything has been done that
could have been done, and so far as we
are informed nothing hat been done
which should have been left undone, in
