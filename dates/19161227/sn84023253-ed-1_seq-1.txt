Vermont except Essex county, which
will meet with the Coos county farm
ers at Lancaster, X H. At Newport
E. O. Colby, president of the Xew
England Milk Producers' association, ;
will be the speaker and organizer, j
The idea is better prices for better
milk, co-operative purchase of sup- ;
plies, associated selling. X. E. M. P. ;
A. proposes that the brand "Made in
Xew England," applied to dairy pro
ducts, shall become so welk.and fa- :
vort'Jbly knov.-n to Xew England eon- i
sumers that every pound of milk and :
cream, butter and cheese, consumed in
.by the millions of consumers in
New England sb.all be produced in
Xew -England. It is believed that this ,
plan may double the amount of money ;
paid to Xew England farmers lor
dairy products, eventually. It may do
more for agriculture, for the up-
building and for the prosperity of ru
ral Xew England than any other one j
thing.
, Each of its speakers will set forth .
how the Xew England Milk Produc-
ers' association secured the full mar- i
ket value for milk sold this winter,
and thus put more than $1,000,000 of!
extra money into the farmers' p oct
et. A big contest is coming over tlie ,
summer price for milk. Therefore ;
every eow owner whose product' is
"c.o"nsufhg!'ii "Xi-wKngraiuJ should he
lined up in tho X. E. M. I A.,"pvhiIe-;
tho;;? on the western edge ot this ter
ritory who ship to Xew York may af- f
filiate with its league. It will be em- '
pbasized hciw the X. E. M. P, A. eov- '
ers all Xew England, and how each I
nsw member who joins now, will have ,
tho same rights and privileges, in per
son or by delegate from his local, as:
present or former members, in the
approaching annual meeting when the
members will adopt a constitution and
by-laws adapted to the larger work
in view.
What Js to Follow.
At each county meeting farmers
may join the X. E. M. P. A. Right '
on the spot those from each town- j
ship or shipping station may complete j
the preliminary organization of their i
local. The county meeting is to ap- :
point an organizing committee of one ,
from each township or shipping sta
tion. Those present who are appoint
ed to this icommittec, shall meet' tho ;
very same day and appoint a chair
man and secretary. These two otfi
cials, with the aid of the other com
mittee men and co-operating with
Richard Patee, secretary X. E. M.
P. A., Myrick building, hpnnglteicl,
Mass., shall proceed to arrange the
time and place for the gathering in
each township or shipping station. At
such local meetings, attended by the
dairymen of the vicinity, the local
union of X. E. M. P. A. will be formed.
After over 24 hours of deliberation
the jury on the case of State vs George
W. Bolton of West Burke, charged
with performing an illegal operation,
were still unable to agree. The jury
reported during Wednesday afternoon,
each time receiving instruction from
the judge and went back to the jury
room for further discussion.
Sentences were given in the cases
of the three young men, Peter Ros
cus, James Brown and William Burke,
convicted for breaking and entering
the Store of George B. Wallace at East
Ryegate about a month ago. Peter
Roscus was sentenced to the house of
correction at Rutland for not less
than 14 months or ''more than tw6
years; James Brown received the
same sentence to be served at the
state prison at Windsor.
William Burke, tho youngest of the
boys, was given the same sentence
which was suspended, and the accused
put in the eare of the probation offi
cer for the minority term. He will
be allowed to go to his home in
Bridgeport, Conn., after being in
structed in the rules of probation.
In the latter case letters were re
ceived from the boy's relatives in
Connecticut assuring the court that
this was the first offense, and that if
allowed to return home Jic would be
looked after. States Attorney Xorton
had no objection to leniency being
shown if the court thought best. In
pronouncing sentence Judge Butler
stated that to pronounce sentence on
a young man just started in a bad
way was one of the courts hardest
duties. He further advised the pris
oners to "think the matter over seri
ously when paying the penalty the
court inflicts." He also said, "You
should come out with a new resolu
tion for the future, you can, if you
will, become men among men and
good citizens."
The divorce case of Annie Hill vs
Bert Hill was given a preliminary
hearing by Judge Butler. Porter, Wit
ters and Harvey represented the com
plainant. After 36 hours of deliberation, the
jury sitting in Caledonia county court,
on the case of "Dr." George W. Bol
ton, charged with performing an ille
gal operation upon Miss Anna Gan
ders, of Bridgeport, Conn., at West
Burke, on Juno 17 l:;yt, reported them
selves as unable to agree. They were
dismissed by Ju6gO"'-Huttfvtt.i-cioien
o'clock Wednesday night. . .
When, the jury failed to bring in a
verdict after 24 hours, many who fol
lowed the case believed that there
would be no verdict returned. The
case excited considerable 'interest in
the county and whether it will be tried
again at the June session of County
Court is not known. If it is, James
B. Campbell will be the prosecutor in
place of States Attorney Xorton whose
term expires before another term of
court.
