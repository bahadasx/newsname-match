GERMAN NOTE

STEP T
Considered a Prelude to a Series of Carefully Consid
ered Moves in Great Game of Diplomacy
NO . D1VULGENCE MADE
Favorable to an Immediate Meeting of Delegates of Bellig
erent Nations to Exchange Peace Views Note is "Viewed
at Entente Ally Embassies as a Document for Circulation
in Germany and Neutral Countries With the Object of
Placing Responsibility for
, Entente Rather Than as
Communication Official
by President Wilson Last
,'yXe& 26. Germany's
reply to President Wilson's note Is re
garded hare as bavins advanced the
peace movement another step despite
the fact that It disappoints in not
meeting: his suggestion for an avowal
of terms. st
The reception Germany's reply re
ceives among the entente allies,
whose statesmen have publicly de
clared against such a program, now
becomes the point upon which a fur
ther move Is hinged. The German
note probably is the prelude te a se
ries of carefully considered delicate
moves In the great game of world di
plomacy, all possibly leading: to an ap
peal for a real discussion of peace
terms on grounds which ail the bel
ligerents may feel can place them at
no disadvantage.
This is the official view of Ger
many's reply so far as it has been
formulated on the basis of the unoffi
cial text. The official copy had not
been received tonight and President
Wilson was keeping his mind open.
Neutral diplomatic quarters, too, re
garded the note as a stap toward
peace and rather leaned to the view
that Germany might follow it with a
confidential communication: of some
nort outlining her terms.
The view of the entente ally ' em-,
bassies, frankly expressed, was that
the note was not an answer to Presi-i
lent Wilson's communication but ra
ther a document for circulation in
Germany and in neutral countries with
the object of molding opinion to place
.lie responsibility for continuing the
war on the entente.
Among the Germanic diplomats the
only view expressed was one of sur
prise that-the reply had preceded re
ceipt of the entente's response to Ger
many's original peace proposal of De
cember 12.
It was everywhere agreed that the
principal sticking point was th-a lack
Of a definite statement of terms such

TROLLEY CAR JUMPED
TRACKS !N WATERBURY
Crashed Into a Three-atory Building
No One Seriously Injured.
Waterbury, Dec. 26. A double
truck trolley car ran away on Con
gress avenue, a steep hill in the Brook
lyn section of Waterbury this after
noon and after a wild dash for al
most a quarter of a mile, jumped the
tracks, crossed Bank street and crash
ed against a three-story brick build
ing on Bank street, owned by John
Yoksza. There were three passen
gers on the car, two women, one of
whom had an infant child, but nei
ther was seriously hurt, although all
were badly shaken up. The crew of
the car had just changed poles at a
switch point, when the car started to
roll down hill. They jumped aboard
and stuck to their posts, escaping
without injury. It is understood the
absence of "air" caused the car to
start. Several big iplate glass win
dows were broken before the runaway
car came to a stop on the sidewalk
and shoppers in the stores .were al
most in a panic when the glass start
ed to ily about their heads. The run
away car narrowly escaped colliding
with Fire Chief Heitman's automo
bile. The chief was on his way to a
fire a few feet away from where the
runaway trolley stopped.
SAN LUIS POTOSI IN
POSSESSION OF VILLA.
Tampico is Believed to Be Objective of
Bandit Chieftain.
El Paso, Tex., Dec. 26. A report
was issued late today by sources
known to be close to Francisco Villa
and by government agents saying that
Villa's forces captured San Luis Potosi
yesterday. Many foreigners who left
Torreon before Villa attacked that
town recently went to San Luis Potosi.
No details are available.
San Luis Potosi is southeast of Tor
reon, on the National railroad line, be
tween -Augascalientes and Tampico.
Tampico is believed to be Villa's ob
jective, in order to obtain a port
through which he can import supplies;
Villa was reported to be between Tor
reon and Chihuahua, preparing to, at
tack Chihuahua soon. '
In anticipation of this attack. Gen
eral Francisco Murguia was reported

M PEACE TERMS
Continuance of the War on the
Answer to President Wilson's
Copy Had Not Been Received
Night
as Lloyd George declared the allies
would require if they were not to put
their "heads in a noose with the rope
ends in the hands of the Germans." It
is not beyond the realm of. diplomacy,
however, to find a way to bridge that
difficulty and Germany's failure is not
regarded as a block to the. negotia
tions although it makes them exceed
ingly difficult.
Germany's declaration that she re
gards the work of securing the world
against future wars as a work' to be
taken up after the present conflict is
ended was regarded with a diversity
of opinion.
Officials who turned back and com
pared the statement with the phrases
of President Wilson's note did not
find the two out of harmony, nor in
disagreement with the president's pub
lic utterances on a world league to
preserve peace; yet there was an in
definable opinion abroad in official
quarters that the ending of the war
and the safeguarding of peace of the
future were a Joint problem so in
separable that one depended on the
other. Those taking this view refer
red to Lloyd George's declaration that
the allies would consider It. . possible
to enter a conference only if Germany
would first openly offer' "reparation.
restitution and guarantees.
The German reply is regarded as
oniy railing 10 ao tnis, dui its sag
gestion that the work be left for the
future, it is feared, may raise a diffi
cult obstacle for the allied statesmen
to surmount with their own people to
whom an absolutely durable peace
has been held out as one of the main
Justifications of the war. It also has
been sheafed by allied statesmen
with the terms which would end the
conflict.
Despatches today from Petrograd
outlining the official view there, fore
shadowing that the- allies would not
discuss peace terms until they stood
in military possession of territory
they claim attracted much attention.
FEW INDEPENDENTS WILL
DETERMINE SPEAKERSHIP
Neither Democrats Nor Republicans
Have Majority in the House.
Washington, Dec. 26. Revised fig
ures on the returns from the last elec
tion show deflntely that neither dem
ocrats nor republicans will have a
majority of the next house, necessary
to elect a speaker, and that a hand
ful of Independents will determine
which side will control the organiza
tion. Conceding seats to candidates in
possession of certificates of election,
because they are certain to participate
in the organization of the house, the
personnel now stands:
Republicans 214, democrats 213; In
dependents 2; progressives. 2; prohi
bitionist 1; socialist 1; contested 2. A
majority is 218, hence should either
democrats or republicans win both of
the contests they would be still short
of amajority.
All of the independents are main
taining a strict silence regarding their
attitude on the speakership, but the
democratic and republican leaders are
agreed on how most of them will vote,
provided caucuses are held and soli
darity maintained by the two old par
ties. TWENTY LEPERS ESCAPED
DURING THEIR TRANSFER
From San Lazaro Hospital to Mariel,
on the Island of Cuba.
Havana, Cuba, Dec. 26. After first
refusing to leave, the San Lazaro hos
pital for lepers, 174 inmates today
agreed to leave for Mariel, on receiv
ing the promise of health officials to
remove them thence to a new hospi
tal now under construction, as soon
as it is finished.
It is reported that more than twen
ty of the lepers escaped from San
Iazaro through a rear exit. Many of
the mwept as they entered the ambu
lance to be transferred to Mariel.
For a time the situation appeared
critical, as It was rumored the lepers
had weapons and threatened to resist
forcible removal. The hospital of
ficers were unwilling to use force.

UNNECESSARY DETENTION OF
FREIGHT CARS INDICATED
By Reports of 8psolal 'Agents of De
partment of Justloe.
Boston. Deo, 88. A widespread and
unnecessary detention of freight cars
In various parts of the country togeth
er with an abnormal -shortage of
freight equipment is indicated by re
ports or special agents of the depart
ment of justice and Inspectors of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, Fed
eral District Attorney George W. An
derson stated today. Mr. Anderson,
who is conducting the federal govern
mnet's Inquiry Into the high oost of
food and other necessaries, asks the
co-operation ol railroads In reporting
to him all unnecessary detentions of
freight cars.
In letters sent today to President
Howard Elliott of the New York, New
Haven & Hartford Railroad, President
James H. Hustis of the Boston &
Maine Railroad, and Vice President
Howard M. Blscoe of the Boston & Al
bany Railroad, Mr, Anderson said:
"In and about some cities (I shall not
of course now state where) we find
that coal cars have been kept after
reaching the delivery point from two
to five times the normal period requir
ed for unloading. Such facts are ex
ceedingly suspicious. The point to
probable combinations in restraint of
trade, particularly when we find them
accompanied by greatly enhanced pric
es, out of which extraordinary profits
must have accrued to some of the per
sons apparently responsible for such
detention of cars.
"I suggest that there be now a sys
tematic co-operation by -the railroads
with this department through your
furnishing to this department at at
frequent periods perhaps daily, lists
of cars held unloaded over 48 hours;
also lists of cars unusually delayed in
reaching destination by reason of the
abuse of the re-consigning privilege.
"If this proposition meets your ap
proval. I suggest that certain com
petent men be designed to co-operate
with the agents of this department in
working out all ncessary details.
"With such an arrangement I think
we can have speedily and effectively
brought to the attention or the law of
ficers of the department all suspicious
facts and we can, then .send . for the
persons apparently responsible for rueh
delays afid detentions, giving them an
opportunity to show whether their acts
are or are not a part of a combination
in illegal restraint of trade.
It is out view that such co-operation
between the railroads and this de
partment will not only prevent many
violations of . the law which otherwise
it might be the duty of the federal
government to prosecute, but also to
assist the railroads."
WAR CONFERENCE OF GREAT
BRITAIN AND HER COLONIES
Prime Minister of Each of the Dom
inions is to Be Invited to Attend.
London, Dec. 26, 7.43 p. m. The sec
retary of state for the colonies has sent
a telegram to the dominions explain
ing the purposes of the forthcoming
imperial conference - announced by
Premier Lloyd George. The telegram
explains that what the government
contemplates is not an ordinary im
perial conference but a special confer
ence of the empire.
The prime minister of each of the
dominions is "invited to attend a se
ries of spcial meetings of the war
cabinet in order to consider urgent
questions affecting the prosecution of
the war, possible conditions on which
in agreement with our allies, we could
asent to its termination and problems'
which would then immediately arise."
The premiers are urged to attend at
an early date not later than the end
of February.
SAVANNAH DIDN'T GO
TO AID OF MARYLAND
Captain Was Informed Coast Guard
Cutters Had Gone to Her Assistance.
Eoston, Dec. 26. The steamship
City of ' Savannah, which reported early
today as hurrying to the assistance
of the sinking steamship Maryland, ar
rived tonight from Savannah.
Captain Hammond said that he of
fered to go to the Maryland's assist
ance when he picked up her call for
help, but was informed by the dire
less operator at the Sankatv station
that the coast guard cutters Gresham
and Acushnet were speeding to her
aid. He expressed the opinion that
it would have been futile for him to
attempt to reach the Maryland in time
to be of assistance to her.
The Maryland's position was reoort-
,ed as 260 miles off Block Island, offi
cers of the City of Savannah said.
No further signals were heard from
the steamer Maryland yesterday.

VIOLATION OF NEUTRALITY.
States He Neither Forwarded Nor Di
rected Dynamiting Attempts.
San Francisco, Cal., Dec. 26. Franz
Bopp, German consul, oday denied
under cross examination during his
trial with six associates for conspiracy
to violate neutrality, that Captain
Franz von Papen, former military at
tache of the German embassy at Wash
ington, had financed or -directed the al
leged dynamiting attempts charged
against the San Francisco consulate.
Von Papen was . in San Francisco
during 1915, Bopp said, but chiefly for
recreation. It was in- hat year the
government alleges various dynamite
plots against allied munition shipments
and Canadian railroad property were
planned and executed.
"Is it not a fact that Lieutenant G.
W. von Brincken and C. C. Crowley,
two other defendants " in this case,
planned to take service under Von
Papen because he had more money to
spend on dynamiting entente munitions
shipments? District Attorney Preston
asked.
"Not at all. There is nothing to it,"
Bopp replied- "Crowley- went to New
York under mj- directions. He had
failed to obtain the information about
Canadian military contingents for
which I had sent him east. He had a
letter of introduction from me to Von
Papen. It had nothing to do with
dynamiting."

TIME LIMIT FOR MEXICAN
PROTOCOL HAS EXPIRED
Indications Are That a Belated Rati
fication by Carranza Would Be Ac
cepted. Washington, Dec. 26. Although Gen
eral Carranza had not? replied tonight
to the demand of the United States
that he either ratify or repudiate the
protocol drawn by the Mexican-American'
joint commission, the expiration
of the time limit was not made the
occasion for formally declaring the ne
gotiations at an end.
While the time expired at midnight,
officials were inclined to take into con
sideration - that a reply might harff'
oeen delayed and indicated that a fa
vorable reply even though a day or
more late would not be rejected inas
much as an adjustment of the interna
tional difficulties was the chief ob
ject. Refusal to accept the terms of the
agreement, under : which American
troops would be i withdrawn from
Chihuahua, means the closing of . ne
gotiations through the joint commis
sion for adjustment of the questions
at issue between the United States and
the de facto government of Mexico.
What effect the new situation then
presented would have on the policy
of the United States is not known, but
it was said at the state department
today that any further move would be
made through the usual channels, .and
not by the commission which for more
than three months attempted to effect
an amicable settlement.
B. & M. LEASED LINE
SYSTEM WRONG IN PRINCIPLE
In Opinion of Henry B. Day, Federal
Trustee of the'" Stock.
Boston. Dec. 26. Testifying in the
federal district court today on the
question of making permanent the tem
porary receivership of the Boston and
Maine stock owned by the New Tork,
New Haven and Hartford railroad, ex
pressed the opinion that even if the
receivership was removed and the
present rate of earnings kept up, the
road would not be in a position to
pay dividends for at least three years.
Mr. Day testified that the trouble with
the road was that its leased line sys
tem was wrong in principled
Further limitations on the inquiry
were imposed by the court today. Judge
Morton ruled that before going deeper
Into details of proposed plans of re
organization, evidence should be in
troduced tending to show that the pres
ent board of directors was improperly
interested or influenced to bring about
reorganization through a receivership.
Minority stockholders have alleged
that the directors were guilty of breach

petitioning creditors in .assenting to
the receivership.

New Tork, Dec. 26. Unless railroad

conform proportionately to expenses,
Ol wubiui VI HI-. u hi i n a .a.,.
road's is inevitable, according to the
annual report of the general executive
committee of the Railway Business
Association, made public here tonight.
"If total revenues are not made ade
quate to total expenses," the report
states, "no question will long remain
as between federal and state author
ity, because sooner or later the fed
eral government under those condi
tions must take over the roads. In
that case the states would lose all
voice whatever and federal regulation,
if any, would present the grotesque
spectacle of one political officer su
pervisin ganother whose tenure pro
ceeds from the same source of power
as his own. Whoever omits frontalis
prescription statutory obligation upon
the commission to permit rates ade
quate to carry the national business
and develop the country leaves out the
essential ingerdient without which the
whole compound is valueless.
"The present law," the report points
out, "declares that each rate shall be
just, reasonable and non-dlscnmlna-tory."
