afternoon ere to vote on the proposed
loan cf a million and a quarter dol
lars for improvement of the city high
school system and for the erection of
new buildings.

sider the proposed loan and the
recommendations of the special high

of President A. Carson Stamm and

mates of Dr. Downes and President
Stamm were considered too low.

amount $1,250,000, which provides for
purchasing a site and the erection of
a senior girls' high school for more
than a thousand pupils; alterations to
Technical High School, Camp Curtin
grade school. Central High School,
and the erection of a junior high
school on Allison Hill.
Committee's Report
The special high school committee,
of which the Rev. Dr. William N.
Yates is chairman, submitted the fol
lowing report with the recommenda
tion that it be adopted:
"That three junior high schools
and one senior high school for
girls be established and that all
boys, of the senior high school
grade be assigned to the Tech
nical High School as outlined in
the accompanying report pre
pared by the president of the
board and'the city superintendent.
"That the amount asked for in .
the report be changed from sl,-
190,000 to $1,250,000 in accord
ance with the recommendation of
the citizens' cojumittee which is
herewith submitted."
. The building committee recom
" mended that Herman Bitner and Dan
iel White be elected assistant janitors

~ Samuel Seabury, the Democratic can- !
. didate for nomination for Governor, '
to obtain the progressive nomination.
for that office was the most interesting I
' i feature of the New York State primary i
1 to-day. It was not expected that more I
than 20,000 of the 46,000 enrolled!
> progressives would take part in the |
primaries. Both candidates asserted!
; that they would win the progressive)

Governor Whitman's friends as-:

j daey for the Democratic nomination j
j was unopposed. The names of both j

Another contest of importance was:
j that of Robert-Bacon, formerly United

j William M. Calder, a former Congress- :

' for the United States Senate. Mr. ]

Episcopalians May Omit
Prayer For All Infidels
•j New York, Sept. 19.—A'proposal to
" j omit from the prayer 'book of the'
1 Protestant Episcopal Church prayers
c for Jews. Turks, infidels and heretics'
will be submitted to the Episcopal tri- i
J ennial general convention to be held in
• St. Louis in October. . The proposed
changes are approved by the special
commission on the revision of the
j pra> er book.
The proposal to eliminate the Jews
I from Episcopal prayers is based on the
I ground that it is an insult to class
them with infidels and heretics. The I
I purpose in striking out the Turks from I
the prayers Is to avoid .confusing them I
! with Mohammedans. The prayer as j
j proposed reads: "Have mercy upon all j
! who know Thee not as revealed in the !
j gospel of Thy Son."

British Headquarters In France,

It is possible to write more* freely
of the notorious "tanks" than was pru
dent heretofore. Two days before they
were used the writer had an oppor

were resting before their first expe

CAMP HILL PEOPLE
ASK FOR PAVING
Petition Council to Use Loan
Already Approved For Main
Street Improvement
Camp Hill, Pa., Sept. 19.—Canip
j Hill is at last in the way of paving
j Main street from one end of town to
the other. This improvement has been
hanging fire since June of last year,
when Hie voters approved a paving
loan with the understanding that the
State would assist in the construction,
due to the fact that Main street is part
of the State highway through the Cum
berland Valley. Then came the de
cision of the Attorney General to the
effect that no State money could be
used for road construction within bor
ough limits.
When the matter of using the loan
for paving purposes without State aid
came up this summer some of the
councilmen held back because, they
said, they had promised voters that
the State would assist. To counteract
this the taxpayers themselves have
gotten out petitions for the paving and
they are being signed by everybody.
Council will then have no reason to
postpone further action on the paving.
There is ample money in sight .for the
improvement.
