NEW YORK. Sept 18. The United
Hebrew Trades, representing a mem
bership of 200.000 organized workmen
tonight, voted to go on a sympathetic
strike as an 'aid to the striking car
men, if they are called upon to do so
by the Central Federated Union.
NEW YORK, Sept. 18. Failure of
negotiations being conducted by May
or Mitchell to provide a basis of set
tlement of the traction strike in this
city will result in a call Thursday for
a simultaneous strike of approximate
ly 800,000 workers, union leaders de
clared after a conference late today
between representatives of several
crafts.
The call will be issued, it was stated
to all unions affiliated with the Cen
tral Federated Union of New York,
the Central Labor Union of Brooklyn
and the Federated Union of the Bronx,
Westchester and Yonkers. Some of
the unions were advised of a strike,
leaders said, and referendums are in
progress in others.
Shonts "Is Through"
Theo. P. Shonts. president of the
Intertorough Rapid Transit Company
and the New York Railways Company
late today issued a statement in
which he said the companies would
refuse to confer with the strikers.
This announcement was made after
Mr. Shonts had been informed that
Mayor Mitchell had agreed to act with
Oscar Straus, chairman of the public
service commission in an attempt to
bring the strikers and company offic
ers together.
During the day he conferred with
labor leaders but no practical plan
was evolved to settle the difficulties.
Traffic Undisturbed
Traffic on the subway and elevated
lines continued normally today and
there was a noticeable improvement
in surface car conditions.
Some violence was reported and
several arrests were made.
U. S. DOLLAR RULES

Temps Contrasts America's
Position Before War With
the Present
PARIS. Sept. 18. Max Hoschiller,
in an article in the Temps today, con
trasts America's financial position now
in respect to foreign countries, with
that before the war. The article
says:
"Then the United States was send
ing to Europe $300,000,000 in interest
on its borrowing; $150,000,000 to $200,
000.00 spent by tourists: $100,000,000
to $150,000,000 to expatriates and $20,
000.000 to $40,000,000 in ocean freight.
"Since the war the United States
has imported $730,000,000 in gold and
has paid back a considerable amount
of its previous borrowings, increased
its foreign trade by $2,250,000,000
yearly and lent to foreign countries
$1,450,000,000 so that the dollar now
has replaced to a considerable extent
the old sovereign of the English
pound, abroad.
"Whether the United States will re
tain, with her deficient financial or
ganization the recently won lead, will
depend upon American financial and
commercial leaders."

Federal Authorities Grab Sus

From Men.
(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, Sept. 18. While federal
authorities here prepared tonight for
preliminary hearings tomorrow of
seven members of an alleged black
mail gang who used the Mann act as
their chief weapon, detectives made
arrests in other cities and spread a
drag net for H. C. Woodward, sought
as director in chief of the system.
Hinton C. Clabaugh of the United
States Department of Justice declar
ed tonight he had secured sufficient
evidence to convict the gang without J
exposing the names of some of their
wealthy victims. It was understood
none of the names of the victims I
would be bared at the hearings to
morrow. These victims, whose fiirta- j
tions with pretty women led them in- j
to traps, from which they escaped on
ly on payment of large sums, will be
shielded from publicity except as a
last resort, it is said.
Clabaugh expects the seven will be
ordered removed to Philadelphia for
trial without a stubborn resistance be
fore the commissioners.
CHICAGO, Sept. IS. According to
Clabaugh, two of the alleged gang
sters, "Dick" Barrett and Edward J.
Thompson confessed to the charges
and revealed the manner in which
blackmail had been levied in several
instances. Their story was replete
with accounts of ' clever new race
track swindles and other ruses by
which beautiful women and debon
aire, handsome men had fleeced their
victims.
The other men who have been ar
rested and who remain in jail here
pending establishment of bail in the
aggregate sum of approximately $100,
000 would say nothing today of their
alleged offenses, but the women were
vociferous in their denials of guilt.
Women Offended
Mrs. Frances Chapman said nothing
but Mrs. Evers indignantly insisted
that Mrs. Chapman's arrest was "an
outrage," and that she was but a vis
itor at the fashionable apartment
when the raid was made.
Mrs. Edward Donobue, older than
the other woman, surrounded herself,
even in jail, with an air of outraged
dignity. "Ridiculous, too ridiculous
to consider at all," was the way she
summed things up.
George Irwin, who is said to be the
husband of Mrs. Evers, and Jno.
Woodward are being sought through
out the country tonight. It is believed
he now is in New York. The alleged
fleecing of Mrs. Klipper, it was said,
was brought about through Crocker.
After having won her confidence, says
the authorities, Crocker managed to
place her in a position in which her
reputation was endangered, with Don-
ohue and Irwin as witnesses. The
The latter two demanded "hUBh mon
ey." It was said Crocker accepted
jewels, which later proved valueless,
and he gave the police information
which caused Irwin's arrest. Crocker,
however, is said to have rejoined the
band subsequently.

(By Review Leased Wire)
RED BLUFF. Calif., Sept. 18.
Whether prohibition would be econ
omically disastrous for California is
not a question to be considered in the
present wet and dry campaign. Dr.
Ira Landrith, vice presidential candi
date, asserted today in a rear platform
speech. "If the growing of grapes in
California makes it necessary to sell
alcohol," said Dr. Landrith, "then by
Heaven, you should give up the busi
ness and make your money in some
other way. The mere proposition of
making a living is not to be consid

it so long as it violated uprightness,

Wm. Butler, alias Butts, who, federal
authorities say, is one ring leader of

the operations of the alleged black

from Mrs. Susan G. S. Wlnpenny. He
was held in heavy bail and was to
have been brought to trial at the pres

Mrs. Winpenny disappeared several
weeks ago and in consequence the
case has been held in abeynnce.
Several victims of the alleged black
mailers, according to Garbarino were
mulcted of a large sum of money by
Frank W. Irwin, whose home is said
to be Worcester, Maxs., and another
man who is still a fugitive. They rep

"It is true." said Mr. Baker, "that

tractor crawls on two belts with cor
rugated surfaces on each side of the
body. The corrugated surface is tm
the ground. On the inside of the belts,
on each side of the body, are two lines
of steel rails, making four lines in all.
These rails are in short sections, oper

down with their belts, the tractor
moves ahead and picks them up again
so that the car runs on its own self

joints in the rails make it easy to turn

by trucks with five wheels, something
like small railroad trucks. The width

square inch where a thirty inch truck
is used or less than that of the foot
of either man or horse.
Although Mr. Baker would not dis
cuss the matter, it was understood the
United States war department is ex

somewhat like the ones now used in

CHICAGO. SepL 18. The suicide

Plan Works Perfectly
Tuma stood on a pier, fired a shot
into his head, and fell into Lake

voted bills against Michael and Ste

was insolvent, and against Moses Gin

ducted another private bank, on the
same charge.
Tori Generous a Heart
When Mrs. Tuma. the banker's wife
was Informed of his suicide tonight,
she said he had loaned $60,000 to a
contractor and that payment was ov

she said, he had sought to borrow
$10,000 from a down town bank today
but was unsuccessful.
