Prospects of the largest enrollment
In the history of the University of
Missouri are good after two days of
registration. A total of 2,845 receipts
have been made out for persons who
sent in their registration blanks,
meaning an increase of over 400 since
yesterday. Of this number about 2,
150 have already enrolled.
The enrollment tomorrow ends the
three days of regular registration.
The record for the first two days of
enrollment this year passes "the rec
ord for last year by 200. Although all
persons registering late must pay ?5,
a large number are expected to enroll
after the allotted three days have
passed.
I.. M. Defoe, chairman of the Dis
cipline Committee, briefly outlined the
attitude of University authorities to a
meeting of sophomores on the north
steps of Academic Hall last night.
Professor Defoe said:
"Gentlemen, I can tell you the ad
ministration's position In one sentence.
.If jou are reported to me for hazing
jou will be expelled from the Univer
sity at once; if you have not yet en
tered up, you will not be permitted to
do so. Good night!"
L. C. Lazier, student president, told
the assembled sophomores that any
one, known to the student senate .to
have participated In hazing would be
reported to the Discipline Commit
tee. Xew Plan is Explained.
Craig Ruby, president of the sopho
more class, explained the new system
of unhazed freshmen, to the, sopho
mores and outlined the procedure In
the case of freshmen found violating
the rules of the student body. "Hands
off freshmen!" is the slogan. Infrac
tions of the rules by freshmen are
to be reported to the students senate,
which in turn may refer the matter
to the discipline committee.
The spirit of the speakers did not
harmonize with that of most of the
hearers, who threw their laughter be
hind and started toward town. Their
dragnet enmeshed a solitary "frosh"
who answers to the name of Burnett.
He was taken to a point near Ninth
and Cherry streets, where he perform
ed the usual feats for the salvation
of his skin and the edification of the
"sophs." He Impersonated the in
imitable Charley Chaplin, barked like
a fish and ended by putting his feet
in his pockets amid the jeers of his
tormentors and the applause of in
terested spectators.
At filf InncWp r.n fairer of th
law, who had never been a sopho
more himself, appeared.
Freshman SaTed the Day.
Things looked bad for the sophs
when the freshle saved the day. "Oh
Officer," he admitted, "I'm having a
tfine time." A short parley followed.
The officer looked at the beaming
"frosh." Then he looked at the
"sophs" and shivered from the cold
air of reserve with which they had
enveloped themselves. Finally he de
cided that the role of succoring the
distressed was not his and departed
with a lingering suspicion that it
there was any succor he was it only
he spelled it otherwise.
Then came a shattering of tradi
tions. The spohomores gathered the
freshman to their bosoms and, buying
the gaudiest tie in sight, they adorn
ed him with it. They overwhelmed
him with drinks and bought him a
big. black cigar of the regulation vil
lain variety. When the latter was
consumed the best brands of ciga
rettes In the crowd were proffered
him. Subsequently they blew him to
more drinks and presented him with
a pipe.
President Hill and members of the
student senate will speak to the fresh
nan meeting, called by the student
president for 7:30 tonight at the Y. M.
p. A Auditorium. Rules adopted by
fip stMpnt council for the guidance
of freshmen will be explained.

LONDON, Sept. 19. German and
French commanders fell upon the
opposing lines with surprise attacksj
last night, while a heavy rainstorm
impeded operations on the Somme
front. As a result sharp fighting oc
curred at points where there has
been a lull for several weeks.
The Germans battered the Cham
pagne front heavily in. five attacks.
Russian troops stopped every assault,
the French war office announced, in
flicting heavy losses on the Teutons.
The French struck northwest of
Verdun. The German war office ad
mitted that German trenches were
penetrated on Deadman's Hill, the
burial ground for thousands of the
Crown Prince's troops, in the unsuc
cessful attempts to take Verdun from
the west bank of the Meuse.
The only activity on the Somme
front occurred south of the river,
where the French war office this aft
ernoon claimed a slight advance east
of Berny. The German war office ad
mitted the British gains east of Gln
chy and near Combles, reported by
General Haig last night, but announc
ed the repulse of all French attacks.
In the Balkans the pursuit of the
Bulgarians, who have evacuated prac
tically all northwestern Greece, is be-

NEW COMMANDANT TAKES

Lieutenant Joseph C. King, the new
commandant of the Military School of

In the University will be a continua

that he was glad of the opportunity of

DANGER AT MINIMUM
Naints Are Reported to the
Health Authorities as
Soon As Registered,
Precautionary measures have been
adopted by the University health au
thorities against the spreading of in
fantile paralysis germs that may have
been carried to Columbia by students
from cities of the East
All students coming from the East
are being subjected to careful exami
nation for several days after their ar
rival. The name of the student is for
warded to the hospital authorities im
mediately upon registration, and the
student is summoned for examina
tion. All large universities In the East
are still closed on account of the
spread of the plague. Although there
is little possibility of a person of col
lege age contracting the disease, the
authorities have deemed It advisable to
place the date of opening past the
danger time. Most of the eastern
schools will not open until October.
The precautionary measures were
adopted at the University of Missouri
on the recommendation of the Uni
versity Board of Health, headed by Dr.
M. P. Ravenel, and the Parker Me
morial Hospital staff, known as the
University Health Service, headed by
Dr. Guy L. Xoyes.
'There is no danger whatever at the
present time that any case of infan
tile paralysis will develop in or near
Columbia." said Doctor Noyes this
"and our actions should not
be construed by anyone to mean that
we fear an epidemic. It is merely a
'safety first' step. One death In Co
lumbia was attributed to infantile pa
ralysis this summer, but an autopsy
disclosed that death was due to an
altogether different cause.
"Infantile paralysis is a disease
confined almost entirely to children,
a majority of the cases occurring un
der the age of 5 years. It has been
found, however, that older persons
can carry the germs, the seat of in
fection usually being in the glands
of the nose. All students coming from
the 'East will be treated, so that there
will be no danger whatever of the dis
ease being carried from infected chil
dren of Xew York or Philadelphia to
Columbia by one who cannot contract
the disease."
The small possibilities of an epi
demic from this disease in any part
of Missouri is shown in that only
twelve cases have been reported in
St Louis, while more than five hun
dred cases have occurred in Philadel
phia and over nine hundred in New
York City.

Republicans May Dispute
Major's Right to Name a
Successor to Gass.
ny United Press.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.. Sept 18.
It is expected that the authority of
Governor Major to appoint a successor
to Howard A. Gass, state superinten
dent of public schools, who died last
night, for the latter's unexpired term
will be called into question, at least
by the state Republican committee.
The term for which Superintendent
Gass was elected will not expire un
til January 1,"1919. It will be con
tended that the governor can only fill
the vacancy until after the election.
and that in the meantime political
parties can place candidates on the
ticket to hold the office for two years.
These very points are involved in a
case now before the Supreme Court
and which will be heard October 10.
Charles P. Graves, circuit clerk of
St Louis, died last June, and Gov
ernor Major appointed James Hager
man to fill out the unexpired term,
which will end January 1, 1919. The
Republican city committee of St
Louis has obtained a temporary writ
of mandamus to prevent the election
commissioners from publishing Ha
german's name on the ballot
The court will no doubt decide the
Hagerman case in ample' time to meet
the exigency of the November elec
tion. It is reported here that soon after
the funeral of Superintendent Gass to
morrow afternoon, the governor will
appoint H. W. Lampkin of Clinton to
the vacancy.
Howard A. Gass was 63 years old and
a native of Audrain County. He re
ceived his primary ecucation there
and later attended the Mexico Acade
my. He twice served as chief clerk
in the office of the state superinten
dent and once as statistician in that
office. He was a successful Democratic
nominee for state superintendent In
13.1i; and was re-elected in 1914. As
his term was unexpired at his death,
an appointment will be necessary to
fill the office.

VILLA CARRIES AWAY

Bandit Leader Reported as
Fleeing to Fastness of
Santa Clara Canyon.
IS RELAXED
Military Experts See in At
tack New Threat to
Northern Mexico.
By United Tress.
EL PASO, Tex., Sept. 18. With six
automobile loads of ammunition cap
tured in the attack on Chihuahua City
Saturday and with more than 1,000 re
cruits from the Carranza ranks added
to his forces, Pancho Villa today is
reported fleeing back into the fast
ness of the Santa Clara Canyon.
The de facto government troops
from Chihuahua City have abandoned
the chase of Villa. In the meantime
new troops from other points south
are being rushed north to take up the
trail. General Trevino, Carranzista
commander at Chihuahua City, fears
to use the men recruited from north
ern Mexico against Villa because they
invariably desert to him on the first
opportunity.
Military men here do not under-es-tlmate
the Importance of Villa's at
tack on Chihuahua City, and declare
that all northern Mexico Is now at
the mercy of the bandit leader.
These men point out that the city
is the strongest military fortress In
the north and that it was defended
by heavy artillery and a garrison of
7,000 men. Despite this strength Vil
la, after openly boasting that he
would attack the city, made good his
threat
Scores of refugees from Chihuahua
City arrived in Juarez last night,
bringing first-hand accounts of the at
tack and confirming meager reports
that the Villistas overran the city and
left it at their will. Only two civilian
residents of the city were injured and
none of the few American residents.
In the early fighting the Villistas
herded the civilians who appeared on
the streets into vacant buildings and
kept them inside while the fighting
was In progress.
All incoming refugees from the
south declare that a large number of
de facto troops deserted and marched
away with Villa with their arms and
ammunition.
Most of the 1,200 political prisoners
in the penitentiary were released by
the Villistas.
