TIMELY ARTICLE
On the Speed Road Hog and
Advocates Safety First.
. Now Hut we have a few miles of
good roads, of which wc should all
be proud, why not so use them that
the public to whom they belong, may
feel that they are not a curse, but a
very great blessing?
Under the law the ownerrof auto
mobiles have as much right to use
the highways as do the owners of
horse drawn vehicles but no more.
Since both have the same rights it
might be well for all of us to become
a little more familiar with the law,
and adding thereto a little touch of
the "Golden Rule," so conduct our
selves while on the road, that the
feeling of anxiety and dread, which
now pervades the automobile atmos phere,
may give place to one of com
fort and safety. There is no reason
why due regard for the comfort of
others will not bring its own reward
by getting in them a corresponding
disposition. If the driver of a mo
tor car will be considerate of the man
with a road wagon, he may expect
consideration from him, but not oth
rwise.
The law says that in meeting or
passing other vehicles speed must be
reduced to 15 miles per hour. Why
not obey the law? And if it is very
dusty reduce speed to 8 or 10 miles
per hour and save the occupants of
the wagonor machine going in the
opposite direction from a baptism of
dust. Apply the ' Golden Rule"
and you'll feel bettei. 7 ho definition
of the name "road hog" is one who
holds to the middle of the road in
meeting and passing other vehicles or
in being passed. All of these do not
drive automobiles, nor do all drive
liorse-drawn vehicle.
Let us all so conduct ourselves
that the "road hog will become ex
tinct in this county.
It is the duty of every driver,
whether of wagon, buggy or automo
bile, when overtaken by another ve

you think that we could obviate this
by at all timcskeeping a little to the

wise to have a meeting and talk mat

THE EXPENSE OF PEACE
Unotlicial estimates place the ex
pense of the Mexican Expedition and
the assembly of the National Guard
at the border at ?l&,ooo,ooo per
month. This average cost per month
began immediately after the Colum
bus raid in Match. The expense of
returning the 15,000 guardsmen or
dered demobilized to their homes cost
more than $900,000. Just what the
United States will do with all these
claims against Mexico is not known
Foreign countries have all prepared
large claims against Mexico It is
said that Great Britain is likely to
present its bill against Mexico for the
murder of her nationals and the de
struction of property and trade, for
payment through the United States.
The same course may be followed by
other countries.

THE CROPS FOR 1916
Last year the country had "bump
er crops." The Department of Ag
riculture places this year's wheat crop
at 611,000,000 bushels, which is
4 1,000,000 less than last year.
Corn shows a serious decline, though
not nearly so great as that of wheat.
The hay crop is very large, which
may compensate largely for the loss
sustained in corn." From the stand
point of the farmer the small crop
mifht spell disaster unless prices con
tinue to go up. But wheat around
$1.60 a bushel is regarded as pretty
nearly the limit. If the foreign
countries would take care of their
own food supplies the American crop
would undoubtedly be sufficient for
home consumption, but the unusual
conditions in Europe nuke a shrink
age in production a matter of rather
serious concern. There has been
some speculation as to whether or not
a lack of commercial fertilizers, com
posed of Potash, which comes from
Germany, has had anything to do
with the crop shrinkage. A study
of the crop distribution shows that
the potash Mortage is likely not a
factor for the small crop. The splen
did agricultural methods which have
been adopted throughout theUnited
States as a result of the organization
of farmers, has doubtless built up a
conditiod that will make such a thing
as a future crop failuse impossible.

He Changed Places
With His Wife
The prizn winning letter In the
contest. "Tho Most Wonderful
Man I Know" is in the October
American Magazine. Tho writfir
s iys that when tho husband was
ripplpd for life he was forced to
change phces. with his wife.
This is part of the litter:
"The next day as thoy sat to
ga-her the husband said, 'Lottie,
I have solved the problem. We
will change places. You take
the .examination that I have
ttkeu I can teach you the
work.. You earn the saliry. I'll
keep house '
"And they did. Each day the
husband waved a cheery good-by
above bis crutches and turned
back to the house.
"He swept and dusted; he
scrubbed and cleaned thoroughly ;
j le ironed the clothing; ho made
jellies and jams. As for his
iread it was a work of art and
the boast of the neighborhood.
Ohristma', Thanksgiving there
was always a tableful with a
gobbler doue to a tarn.
"Nor was this man behind the
kitchen apron any less tho man.
He read broadly and intelligent

or to quote the latest phrase of
Ir'sh Hjrne Rule oratory, and he
stcoi strong for suffrage."
THE ROCKY OLD
ROCK ISLAND
The stockholders of the Rock Is
land Company have seen their $150,
000,000 in stock vanish in thin air
The receiver was only able to realize
$10,000 for the creditors. IheRock
Island Company was one -of the
greatest of 'mushrooms" in railroad
financing. It wa$ organized in 1902
with $96,000,000 common, and $54,
000,000 preferred, to hold all the
stock of the Chicago, Rock Island
and Pacific Railway Company, which
was the operating company. The
relations between the holding com
panies ana tne operating company
have long since been dissolved, and
Rock Island common and preferred
have been for some time stricken
from the Stock Exchange after selling
for fewer cents than they did for dol
lars a share in the days of the rail
roads exploitations. The operating
company itself is in the hands of re
ceivers, with little chance of rehabili
tation except on the payment by
stockholders of an assessment of $40
a share.

Buying at Long Range
The October Woman's Home;
Companion has an article about buy
ing materials for making things to
sail. In it the writer says:
"If you live at a distance from
large cities, the buying problem Is
both harder and easier harder, be
cause it must be done by mail with
out seeing the goods, and easier, be
cause the letters on business letter
heading enter unquestioned as entitled
to wholesale service,
"In buying at long range, so to
speak, there are two methods open:
one to buy by catalogue, which in
any reputable house is pretty sure to
be reliable and accurate, the other
through professional shoppers, o
whom there are many hundred in
every large city. Catalogue buying;
is preferable. I believe, in either
case, there is the objection that some
one else's judgment must be taken.
'The professional buyer charges a
commission for her services; whether
it nominally comes out of the store;
or the purchaser makes no difference,
it is there, and unquestionably the
best price can be had from the store.
direct without any middleman. In
buying direct, unsatisfactory purchas
es are more easily adjusted between
two parties to the transaction than
thrdugh three."
