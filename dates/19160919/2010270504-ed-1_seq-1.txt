Why not ask yourself?
"When will the next premium oh my Insurance Pol
icy be due? What will it amount to? Can I meet this
expense easily, without using money I will need for
other things?"
These are questions that every mah who
carries life insurance be he old or young,
wealthy or only in moderate circumstances , y
should ask himself right away.
Most men no matter what the feize ot 'their annual
incomes find it hard to meet the expense of the yearly
insurance premium. And WHY? Simply because these
payments come due when least expected, and more often
than not no preparation for paying them has been made.
The solution to this financial problem is to
plan ahead, and thus be certain of having the
money when needed. This can be done by
adopting the
"THRIFT' INSURANCE PAYING PLANS.
