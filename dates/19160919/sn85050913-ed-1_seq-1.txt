JURAT SUCCESS
Methodist Ladies Net Over One Hun­
dred Dollars at Supper and
Entertainment.
A very large number of people sat
down to the well prepared supper in
the Methodist church basement at
t»:30 Friday night, having gone in
response to printed invitations in
these words:
This birthday party is given to you
'Tis something novel, 'tis something
new.
We send to each this little sack—f
Please cither send or bring it back
With as many cents as you are old
(We promise the number shall nev
er be told.)
The ladies will give us some good
things to eat,
And kind friends will furnish a mus
ical treat
And now we extend to you greetings
most hearty,
Feeling sure that you'll come to your
own birthday party.
The ladies of the church, who had
charge of the affair, took in $10G
above expenses—a sum much larger
than they anticipated.
At 8 o'clock an interesting pro
^gram of readings and musical num
hers was listened to by the av 'once.
This included a children's qt. ._, 'stte
by the little Misses Miriam l£amp
hoefner, Aurilla Peterson, Helen
Hearn and Dorothy Fear, who ren
dered one vocal number in which
they appeared in foreign costumes,
each carrying the musical instru
ment of their native land.
The affair was a notable success,
both financially and socially, and the
ladies in charge are to be congratu
lated.
In an attempt to reduce the car
shortage which is now imminent on
their line the Illinois Central has is
sued a number of bulletins urging
shippers to aid in keeping the sup
ply of cars moving. A communica
tion received at the local station asks
shippers of the road to load and* un
load cars as quickly as possible an«i
.that by doing this consistently the
danger of a serious car shortgage
"*may easily be averted.

PIONEER SETTLER
CALLJEDBY DEATH
Samuel Ferrell Passes Away at Fam­
ily Home in This City—
72 Years of Age.
Samuel Ferrell, a pioneer settler
of Hamilton county, passed away at
the family home on Division street
about 11 o'clock a. m. Saturday fol
lowing a second paralytic stroke and
a touch of apoplexy. Mr. Ferrell sus
tained a stroke of paralysis in Feb
ruary and since that time his health
had been poor but he had never been
bedfast. During the winter the de
teased spent a month in Colfax in
the hope of regaining his health.
Mr.. Ferrell passed a,way peaceful
ly, complaining of nothing but a
slight pain in his head. He dressed
himself as usual that morning, go
ing downstairs to breakfast at about
8 o'clock. Shortly after that he
complained and as the pain became
more severe a physician was called.
However, the patient failed fast un
til the end came.
Samuel Ferrell was born near
Dresden, Muskingum county, Ohio,
Juty 7, 1844, his age being 72 years.
In 1882 he came to Hamilton coun
ty with his family, settling on a
farm north of Jewell. During his
residence in Hamilton county he had
owned many acres of'land in this
county and also much in South Da
kota. However, he had disposed of
his land holdings sometime ago.
The deceased was one of twelve
children and three brothers and
three sisters survive him. All live at
distance except John Ferrell, a
brother, near Blairsburg. Mr. Fer
rell leaves a wife and three children
to mourn his death. The children
are Adolph Ferrell, Carthage, S. D.:
Mrs. Blanche Day, this city, and Gur
nea Ferrell.who also resided in Carth
age until last winter, when he came
here to make his home.
In the passing of Mr. Ferrell an
other of our brave Civil war veter
ans has been called to the groat be
yond. Samuel Ferrell was a private
in Co. B., 47th regiment at! Ohio In
fantry volunteers*, and side by side
with his brother, John Ferrell of
Blalrkburg, fought in many of the
great battles during the Civil war.
He was on Sherman's march to the
sea wa3 in the battle at Fort Mc
Allister in Georgia, at Bentonvl'.le
and Raleigh, N. C., and he was pres
ent at the surrender of Savannah.
When Lee surrendered at Rirhmontl,
Private Ferrell was among the brave
lads present and when the Grand
Review was held in Washington, D.
C., May 23rd and 24th, 1S6C, this
soldier boy' was again among those
present. He received bis honorable
discharge at Little Rock, Ark., in
Sept. 1&65, after the war had closed.

E. Files Issues a Statement—De­
clares That He is not Much
of a Partisan.
Fort Dodge, Sept. 18.—J. R. Files,
democratic candidate for congress
from this district, said in an inter
view this morning that he had visit
ed twelve of the fourteen counties in
this district and that he bad found
much encouragement in the progress
of his campaign. Mr. Files declared
that he was especially pleased with
the formation of the nonpartisan or
ganization in Webster county to as
sist in liis election, since he said he
was conducting his campaign largely
on a nonpartisan basis.
"I am not a very fierce partisan,"
said. Mr. Files, "and I am trying to
conduct my campaign on a higher
plane than merely making it an ap
peal to blind partisanship. I have
been in twelve of the fourteen coun
ties of this district and I have found
much encouragement. Nine out of
ten measures upon which a congress
man is called upon to vote arc non
partisan in their character, and the
audiences to which I have thus far
spoken have shown the most friend
ly and open minded disposition to
ward my candidacy. I am especially
pleased with the formation of the
nonpartisan organization in my home
county to assist me in the election.
It has been fifteen years since Fort
Dodge has furnished a congressman
for this district and it affords a lot
of satisfaction for a man to receive a
nonpartisan endorsement from hrs
friends and neighbors. I am sincere
ly hoping to carry this county by a
good majority."
Mr. Files took a rap at Frank P.
Woods, the republican candidate.
"Without reference to party," said
Mr. Files, "I have found that a feel
ing prevails quite generally that this
district is not properly represented.
Mr. Woods has been circulating lit
erature about the district in which
appears this statement: '1 have con
ceived the idea that the man who
talks least renders the finest public
service.' The only way a public ser
vice can be rendered by eight years
of silence is on the theory that some
one else has something better to say
and can say it better than the man
of profound silence. Then perhaps
he may render a public service by
continuing his silence. People don't
have to be reminded that Senator
Dolllver didn't rise to the position
of a national character by such

Com in Northern Iowa and Southern
Minnesota Beyond Damage
From Frost is Claim.
Dubuque, Sept. IS.—The current
weekly crop report of the Illinois
Central Railroad Company for north
ern Iowa and southern Minnesota has
it that the favorable weather of the
past week did wonders toward ma
turing crops of all kinds, and says
that there is but little corn that is
not beyond danger from frost. The
report is as follows:
"In addition to copious rains, dur
ing the past week, the temperatnre
ranged from five to six degrees above
normal, resulting in excellent prog
ress being made by the late crops.
However, more is necessary to put
the ground into condition for rail
plowing.
"Sufficient sunshine and moisture
lias hastened the maturing of the late
planted corn and by the end of the
coming week a good share of that
crop will be beyond all danger from
frost. The early corn Is now all
safe. Some farmers are feeding new
corn while others claim it to be hard
enough to shell. On the whole the
crop will be far superior to that of
last year, both in quantity and qual
ity, but not up to the mark set in
1914. Cutting of corn for silos is go
ing on rapidly and will be completed
within the next few days.
"Threshing has been completed
with a few exceptions in the Albert
Lea district, where on account of
wet weather, machines were unable
to finish up work started earlier in
the week. The farmers in the coun
try adjoining this division are, as a
rule, well satisfied witli the grain
crop this year. The grade is high
and there was a normal yield in
nearly all of the small grains, the
general averages being, as stated in
previous reports, about what they
have averaged in the last four or five
years.
"The hay crop was a very good
one and with the present prices ev
eryone seems to be satisfied. Fall
pastures have been decidedly bene
fitted by the recent rains and have
provided sufficient pasturage for cat
tle. Clover is being cut for seed and
alfalfa is ready for the fourth cut
ting.
