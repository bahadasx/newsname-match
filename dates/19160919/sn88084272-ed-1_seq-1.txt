cause of Contests.
New York. Sept 19. A contest for
the Progressive vote is being waged In
New York's statewide primaries today,
at which candidates fcr United States
senator and a complete state ticket will
be nominated.
Chief interest in the election appar
ently centered in whether the former
leaders of the Progressive party will be
able to swing the votes of a majority of
the rank and file to Gov. Charles S.
Whitman, leading Republican candidate
for governor. One plank of the party
favors the election of judge Seabury.
whose candidacy for sovernor on the
Democratic ticket is unopposed.
National, as well as state leaders of
both parties are deeply interested In
the outcome of the Progressive pri
mary contest for they believe it may
have an important bearing upon the
outcome of the presidential campaign
in New York. It Is conceded by both
sides that a majority of thoee who
vote for Gov. Whitman in the primaries
will support Charles E. Hughes for
president while most of those who sup
port Judge Seabury will vote for Mr.
Wilson.
Ilooaevelt Support naeon. ,
The contest between Robert Bacon,
former ambassador' to France and Win.
H Calder, a former congressman, for
the Republican nomination for the
United States senate, is attracting much
attention. Mr. Baton did not enter the
lists until a few weeks ago and has
based his appeal for support largely
upon his adovcacy of military prepared
resc An incident of the day was the
publication of a letter from Theodore
Roosevelt, urging Mr. Bacon's nomina
tion on the preparedness issne.
The Democrats a"lso have a contest on
their bands for the senatorial nomina

aspirations of Thomas F. Conway, of

man's nomination within his own party
came from state senator Win. S. Ben
