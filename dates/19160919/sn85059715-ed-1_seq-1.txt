CHATTER ABOUT
STATE ECONOMY
IS RIDICULOUS
?
Wilson's Responsibility Greater
Than That of Governor,
Says Mengert.
Writing to the chairman of the
Republican state committee, W. I?.1
Mengert. thp able and brilliant edi
tor of the Parkersburg State Journal, |
one of the best and most influential
j newspapers published in the state,
and which is now doing valiant ser
: vice for the Republican ticket and
Judge Robinson especially, although
it did not support him for the nomi
nation. says:
"I believe the past experience of
this state with the Democracy, par
ticularly in the hands it is in, has
been such as to obscure whatever
danger there may be in Republican
' factionalism. In the light of the
situation In the nation the chatter
about economy In the state is ridicu
lous. and cannot be acepted in good
faith.
j "Mr. Wilson's responsibility for
' the plunderbund at Washington is
; greater than the responsibility of a
! governor, for he appoints his depart
ment heads, and by the very nature
of things, his control of Congress is
much more secure and stable than
is the control of the governor over
a legislature. Mr. Cornwell finds it
possible, however, to produce a com
plete alibi for Mr. Wilson, while he
condemns the Republican state,ad
ministration, and I wonder how
many people he will deceive by so
palpable a ruse.
"Aside from this the vagaries that
they will propose to substitute for
what has actually been done in the
way of economic and industrial leg
islation in this state, hardly consti
tute an issue that will appeal to the
people."
