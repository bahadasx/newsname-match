If any ono thought thnt tho Repub
licans of Cacho county nro In nny
mood to concede tho county to the
Democrats, the enthusiasm manifest
ed In tho County Republican Conven
tion held last Snturdny will serve no
tico on nil such individuals that such
Is notthe case, nnd If tho' aggrega
tion 6f third termers, olllco holders
nnd deputies en the Democratic tick
et have at any time cherished tho
thought that tho people would grant
their chorishod desires and continuo
thorn longer nt tho public crib, tho
ticket nominated last Snturdny will
bo tho very host evidence thnt their
days are numbered nnd that thoy
will soon bo retired to privnto life
For several hours prior to tho ap
pointed time for tho convention. Rn-
publicans from tho city and county
began to gather In llttlo groups along
Mnln street, slinking hnnds, hobnob,
bhig with each other, talking over
conditions and prospects nnd bj tho
time Chairman H. A. Podorson call
ed the convention to ordor nt 11:00
o'clock, every precinct In tho county
ws represented. Chairman Pedcr
Ben congratulated the delegutes ns
sembled on conditions nnd prospects
Confronting tho party and said that
from tho way tho Republicans had
responded from ovcry precinct In tho
county .victory wns certain for tho
Republican party this fall. Ho then
Introduced Hcrschol Bullon of Logan
ns temporary chairman ot tho con
vention and Henry McCrnckon ns
temporary secretary.
Mr. BuIIqu said thnt tho coming
campaign wns perhaps the most lm
portant In the history of tho United
Stnts ns the world wldo condltioni
nftcr the wnr, during a period of re
construction, would roiiuiro the ser
vice mid ORsUtanco of the United
States In a way that will And tho
Democratic party very incnpablo and
Incompetent, Ho touched up Presi
dent Wilson en his bid for tho pro
gressive vote when hu recently snld
at Shadow Lawn, "that the Democrat
lc party luni almost lived up to the
plntform of tho Progressive party,"
nnd brought forth considerable ap
plause and merriment In trying to
llmt out what on earth Senator Olfiu
James handed President Wilson tho
Democratic platform for, Just prior
to the notification ceremonies.
Ho then took up the recent labor
troubles wnereln President Wilson
ni:d tho Democratic Congress sur
rendered to four brotherhoods nnd
quoted Senator llornh who sold, "we
hato cringed and crawled, wo have
iiuiuiumeu ourselves, aciiauclicu our
gOMirnnient, discredited union lnbor
nnd settled nothing.".
.He then discussed tho stand taken
by tho Republican candidate, Gov.
Charles E. Hughes at Nashvlllo nnd
quoted Governor Hughes ns follows:
"I stand for lo things- first, for tho
principle of fair, linimrtlnl, thorough,
candid arbitration; nnd secondly for
legislation on facts arcordlng to tho
necessities of tho case; and I nm op
posed to being dictated to either In
tho executlvo depnrtment or In Con
gress by nny power on enrth beforo
tho fncts iro known nnd In the ab
sence of the facts."
Mr. llullen then asked tho farm
ers, producers and consumers when
thoy could oiganlze a union of thoir
own und what chance they would
have for striking, when they began
to shell out tho shcckols to pay for
tho recent action of "the Democratic
Congross.
In a State capacity, Mr. Bullon
said, "tho snmo vnclllntlng wobbling
expedient policy that hns prevailed In
tho nation has characterized tho atti
tude of tho Democrats in tho Btato.
I Like n drowning man grasping nt a
straw, they have chased overy rain
bow and adopted every pnsslblo ex
pedient in tho hopes of catching a few
votes. Their inslncero stand on the
prohibition, question Is ono of tho
grcatost monuments of their expedi

In their endeavor to hoodwink the
peoplo four years ngo, thoy cmbnrk
ed under nn insincere Stnto wldo pro
hibition hnnnqr, nnd woro promptly,
nnd righteously repudiated nt tho
polls. The policy of securing Stato
wldo prohibition as advocated by tho
Republicans, on a platform of educa
tion and preparation, wns so logical
and consistent, thnt tho peoplo nro to
bo roiiGrntulnted on their repudiation
of tho Democratic party. And now
that tho tlnio has arrived for tho en
