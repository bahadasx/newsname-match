Say Withdrawal of Army
is Essential to Settlement
NEW LONDON, Conn., Sopt. 19.
The commissioners encountered their
first difference when they wero dis
cussing steps for a border partol after
Ocnernl Pershing's expedition is with
drawn. The Mcxicaa members say they are
unable to discuss this issue until tho
withdrawal question is settled. The
Americans Insist that Carrania has
not shown ability to precerve order,
and hence withdrawal is Impossible
until iiHurances of proper patrol after
wards are found.
Tho Moxleans maintain that an
early wltbdrnwaT of tho American
forco Is essential to nny settlement of
the border difficulty.
lnto this afternoon the Anierlnm
I commissioners agreed to move nt once
to a consideration of withdrawal or
the American force from Mexican soil
and then take up arrangements for a
border patrol. The Mexican commis
sioners pledged their government to
send n force to replace General Per
shing's expedition as soon as the
American force is removed.
It is believed that danger of a break
between tho "commissioners from tho
two governments Is passed.
The Mexican members Ray the
Villa problem is greatly simplified
t now that Villa is doflnitoly located.
.They declare Carranra is delermln
to execute the bandit leader when he
Is captured.

EL PASO, Tex.. Sept. 19. Fearing
federal troops in the northern part of
Mexico will desert to Villa if they
meet him, President Carranza has or
dered troops from the south to pur
bue the bandit leader.
It was learned today that Villa cap
tured six truck loads of ammunition

urday. Prominent military officers here de
clare Villa's attack and raid 'of Chi
huahua City shows he dominates
Northern Mexico, as Chihuahua City
is the strongest fortress in this part
of Mexico.
Commanders of Carranza forces in

any day, are reln.'orclng heavily with

Only 12 Miles of Road
Unfinished in the Park
When the road work beiug dono In
Crater Lake National Park this sea
eon Is completed only twelve miles of
load will be left ungraded, according
to Lieutenant George E. Goodwlu,
United States army englneor in charge
of 'the road construction. This re
maining twelve miles will be part of
the highway around the rim of tho
lake.
The work this year will be carried ,
on until about November 1st, or two.
weeks laer than usual. At that time ,
between forty-five and forty-six mll8 (
of highway will be graded and ready j
for pavement. It will extend from
the top of Cloud Gap on the east to
I.loa Rock on the west.
"The work this year' has been par
ticularly difficult and slow because of
the character of the formations en
countered," said Lieutenant Goodwin
this morning. "It Is the heaviest and
most spectacular of any, and extendi
for three or four miles." r
After grading of all the highways
throughout the park Is computed
next season, paving of the entire road
will be begun. It is felt certain that
The remaining twelve miles of grading
can be finished next year.
"We were held u in our work this
year because of a late seaKra''Ml:e-
cause we cannot get men to work on
the roads," eald Lieutenant Goodwin.
"We did not get started until August
5th, and never did have all ttiVwea
we wanted. Now we are working
about 100 men, and easily could use
another 100. We wil pay S3 Uy
and board, and can guarantee wk
tor at least another month, and prob
ably until November 1st." .
