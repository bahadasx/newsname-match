THAN POLITICAL"
TfUMCAN
Many Prominent Women to Speak
in Bismarck in Support
of Hughes.
PARTY ARRIVES IN
CAPITAL CITY, OCT. 9
Local Committee Will Announce
Arrangements for Reception
in Short Time.
"More Patriotic Than Political."
This is the unique slogan of the
Women's Special Campaign train,
which leaves New York October
2, and arrives in Bismarck October
9. Mrs. Eula Harris, press agent
for the tour, spent a portion of her
time in the city Sunday, enroute to
Spokane, arranging details for the
trip.
The local committees and arrange­
ments will be announced soon. Some
interesting features are planned for
Bismarck and the citizens should turn
out, regardless of political affiliations,
to give these distinguished women a
royal reception.
Not Suffrage Movement.
Although the trip is arranged to
promote Hughes' candidacy, it is dis­
tinctly apart from the suffrage move­
ment It is not in ony sense a "Votes
For Women" propaganda. Its mis­
sion is to arouse patriotism and a
finer sense of Americanism. These
women believe that Hughes is the
proper leader in such a crisis as this
and that President Wilson has failed
lamentably in coping with the big
issues of the day.
Mrs. Alice Roosevelt Longworth has
been given a special invitation to ac­
company the train and visit her l'ath
er'si old stamping ground in the vicin­
ity of 'Medora. She may accept.
First Time.
This is the first time that women
have been accorded an active part
in the campaign arrangements of any
party. Wlhile the train is planned to
make a special appeal to tfhe states
where women vote, the stops enroute
are made to arouse enthusiasm for
the national and state tickets.
Welfare subjects will be discussed
and also Hughes' great work in New
York state to better social conditions.
Patriotism and Americanism will al­
so be keynotes.
The Committee.
There is a .national train committee
reaching from coast to coast. Among
those on the, committee are: iMrs
Arthur Capper, George Sutherland,
Herbert Humphrey, Thurston Ballard,
Nicholas Longworth, Harry Payne
Whitney, Daniel Guggenheim, George
H. Partridge, Walter Damrosch, Win
slow Williams, Phoebe Hearst, Cor
nelius Vanderbilt, Gifford Pinchot,
Charles M. Hoffman, Erward T.
Statesbury, Spencer Penrose and
IMiss Maude Wetmore. The ladies of
the train committee will meet the
train with members of the local Wo
m's Committee of the Hughes Alli­
ance and accompany the train across
the state, leaving it just as it reaches
the border, where the committee from
the next state will meet it.
To Present Banner.
Banners will be presented to the
mayors of the various towns visited,
whether he is Democrat or Republi­
can, for the platform of the Women's
Special is that of the Hughes Alli­
ance—"Americanism." In some towns
speeches will be made from the plat­
form of the train. In others, noon
meetings or even morning meetings
will be held and in a few of the big­
gest towns tremendous night meet­
ings will be held in the largest hall
or auditorium of the city.
Not less than 10 speakers will be
carried on the Women's Campaign
Special. Those asked to go are:
Mrs. Henry Moskowitz, Miss Agnes
Riddle, Miss Helen Todd, Mrs. Ray­
mond Robins, Miss Mary Dreier, Mrs.
Joseph T. Bowen, Mrs. Ella Fiagg
Young, Commissioner Katherine Da­
vis, Mrs. Charles Board, Miss Maud
Miner, Mrs. V. G. Simkovitch, Edna
Ferber, Gertrude Atherton, Inez Gil
more, Mary Roberts Rhinehart, Mary
Shaw, Miss Helen B'oswell, Miss Zona
Gale. Miss Frances A. Kellor, who
is chairman of the New York State
committe of the Women's committee
of the National Hughes Alliance, will
be in charge of the tour.
Financed by Women.
This tour is entirely financed and
directed by women. In each town
visited a representative Republican
will be asked to introduce the women
speakers, but in the west, where the
women have the privilege of the vote,
a prominent local woman will be ask­
ed to make the introductions.
The meeting will be open for both
men and women, and it is exxpected
that the meetings will be tremendous­
ly successful, both in number of at­
tendance and enthusiasm.
The special cars will be decorated
in banners and the speakers will live
on the cars from the day the tour
begins until it ends.

BERTHOLD RESERVATION
Three Congressmen arrived on No.
1, Saturday evening to spend a two
weeks outing in North Dakota as the
guests of W. D. Boyce, Chicago pub­
lisher and R. N. Stevens of Bismarck.
In the party are the following con­
gressmen: William W. Wilson, Chi­
cago: Dr. Andrew Jackson Barchfeld,
Pittsburgh Daniel Reade Anthony,
Leavenworth, Kan., and C. M. Diggs
and E. P. Krause of Pittsburgh.
The party left Sunday evening for
Fort Berthold where they will hunt
for two weeks.
Congressman Wilson has just come
from Chicago where he was victorious
in the recent primaries in the face
of bitter opposition. He voted
against the Adamson Eight Hour bill
and despite the large number of vot­
ers in his .district who belong to or­
ganized labor, he was able to win
out over his opponent. Mr. Wilson
was also opposed by the Mayor
Thompson ring.
Speaking of President Wilson, Con­
gressman Wilson said:
Democratic administration will be a
menace to this nation. President
Wilson has sacrificed everything to
political expediency. The Adamson
bill was one of the most destructive
and hmuiliating pieces of legislation
ever enacted. Nothing is too sacred
now to be debased for political pur­
poses. President Wilson does not
seem to have any well defined poli­
cies on anything. He is constantly
changing and shifting his position.
His own party can hardly keep pace
with his varying moods."
Congressman Wilson has made a
distinguished record in Congress. He
is a close friend of Governor Hanna
and conferred with him Sunday. Con
ted to the bar is best known as a
newspaperman in the Sunflower state.
He has served as Major of Leaven­
worth and has been a member of
congress since 1907. He is a nephew
of Susan B. Anthony.
Dr. Andrew Jackson Barchfeld be­
sides being successful in politics is
prominent in the medical profession
of Pennsylvania. He has served con­
tinuously in Congress since th§ Fifty
ninth session.

Dennett, former United States land
commissioner, declares the east is for
Hughes. Mr. Dennett, visiting in Far­
go when bound for the Pacific coast,
says Hughes' campaign has hit a pop­
ular chord, and the Republican lead­
ers generally are sanguine of success.
Maine's turn-over to the Republi­
cans is pointed to by Mr. Dennett as
evidence of the Progressive trend to
the Republican party.
Mr. Dennett was a resident of Mil­
ton, N. D., prior to the time he went

BLAZE DOES DAMAGE

Heroic Work of Chief Thompson
and His Crow Checks Seri
Conflagrat'on
F4re partially destroyed the resi­
dence of Peter Schantz, 814 Avenue
B, early yesterday morning. Mem­
bers of the fire department respond­
ed to the call promptly and it is due
to the efforts of Chief Thompson and
his crew of valiant fire fighters that
a serious conflagration was averted.
The call came at 4:30 in the morn­
ing and the blaze quenchers were
soon on duty and in a short time
had complete control of the fire. Mr.
Shantz had been having some paint­
ing and other renovating done to his
residence and the fire had its origin
in a bundle of oily rags and waste
thrown in the shed adjoining the
kitchen. The flames spread rapidly
to the kitchen itself and when the
firemen arrived on the scene the
building was a mass of smoke and
flames. They had their equipment
out in short order and checked the
blaze before it spread to other por­
tions of the house.
The damage is estimated at ap­
proximately J^OO. The loss is en­
tirely covered by insurance.

Mr. Rasmussen.
Mr. Rasmussen declares that dur­
ing a short stop in Scotland, the en­

French Capture Trench.
There is considerable artillery ac­

the Verdun front the French have
captured a trench on the southern
slope of the famous dead man's bill.
To stem the tide of the advance of
the armies of the Central Powers in
the vicinity of Dobrudja region of
Roumania, the Roumanians and Rus­
sians have seized their retreat and
have definitely drawn their battle
line.
This extends along the front of
Rachova-Txopadln-Tuzla, running
from the Black Sea to the Danube,
just south of the ancient double ram­
part known as Trajan's wall, which
begins at Constanza on the sea and
runs westward to the river. Both
Sofia and Berlin report fresh advances
in this region while in Transylvania
the Roumanians are reported to be
continuing their progress against the
Teutonic Allies.
Petrograd is silent with regard the

Russian Attacks Repulsed.
Along the Zlota Lipa river, between
the Sereth and, the Stripa rivers, and
to the west of Lutsk, Russian attacks
were repulsed with heavy losses.
Victory for French.
In Macedonia the French troops
have captured the town of Fiorina
Greece from the Bulgarians, who are
reported by Paris to be retreating in
disorder. In the late Ostrovo region
and near Cerna the Serbs have gain­
ed additional ground. On the Dorian
front, where the British are engaged,
only artillery engagements have tak­
en place.
Success for Turks.
Several successes of the Turks are
related in a Constantinople official
communication. British endeavors to
advance from the Suez canal and at­
tempts to attack in the F«lahi sec­

All of Germany's ports in east Af­
rica now are in the hands of the Brit­
ish, Lindi and Mikindanr, having been
evacuated. In addition the Germans
have been driven from the Gourgllu
