jurlos to Neutrals.
Washington, D. C., Sept. 18.—Great
Britain's reply to the American note
protesting against seizure and censor
ship of neutral mails is on its way to
Washington and is understood to be
largely a repetition of arguments in
justification of the policy of the allies
contained in a preliminary memoran
dum received here last February.
The protest of the United States,
made May 24, declared that "only a
radical change in the present British
and French policy restoring to the
United States its full rights as a neu
tral power will satisfy this govern
ment."

en the censorship as much as possible

the series of conferences to be held in
New York this week between leading
American exporters and Sir Richard
Crawford, trade adviser of the embas
sy, had been arranged.
Embassy officials specifically denied
reports from Berlin that Great Brit
ain had suspended cable commqpica
tion to Holland and Denmark and prac
tically had cut off mail communication
between those countries and the out
side world.

Rifles were useless in the hand to
hand street light which followed, the
reports said. Pistols and bore fists
were used, as the two commands
struggled though the early morning
hours in the rain. When finally the
artillery fire, which Gen. Thevino di
rected from Santa Rosa, a fortified hill
to the west of the city, had forced
the Villlstas to retire, they left the
streets behind them cobbled with their
dead.

MEXICANS RESENT PROBE
OF INTERNALCpiTIONS
Warning Oomes From Carranza That
Border Question and Withdrawal
of Troops Is Real Issue.
New London, Conn., Sept. 18.—Con
trary to the plan of the American
members, the joint Mexican-American
commission, which resumed its confer
ence here today, took up again the
consideration of plans for control of
the border.
Luis Cabrera, chairman of the Mex
ican delegation, who presided today,
admitted that reports of the discussion
of the internal affairs of his country
had brought to him an inquiry from
his government as to why the border
question was not made paramount.
The American members, convinced
that the border conditions are intim
ately related to the internal affairs of
Mexico, had planned to direct the dis
cussions today along the lines of so
cial and economic developments in an
effort to find a base for a solution that
might prove lasting. The Mexicans
entered the conferenoe determined to
discuss only the border situation
which involves the question of with
drawal of the American troops. The
conference was resumed this after
noon.
It was explained by those close to
the Mexican commissioners that such
discussion as had already taken place
regarding interior affairs of Mexico
was regarded by their government as
unwarranted.
Members of the American commis
sion did not regard the insistence of
the Mexican representatives in pre
ferring discussion of the border situ
ation as anything endangering the
success of the conference.

tempted to strike Gohlson with a beer
bottle while the latter was in the act
of cranking the auto. Gohlson is said

the bottle and to have struck Burn
sides in the head with the crank of
the car.

BLACKMAIL SYNDICATE IS
UNEARTHED IN CHICA60
Federal OfHcera 8eoure Evidence of
Widespread Operations Netting
Millions to Crooks.
Chicago, Sept. 18.—Confession has
been made by two members of the al
leged syndicate of blackmailers, eight
of whom are under arrest here, that
operations of the swindlers has net
ted them $1,000,000 within the laBt
year, federal officials announced today.
The confessions, it was declared,
disclosed that the alleged band num
bersvat least sixty—a third of whom
are said to be women, young, pretty
and crafty. A dispute over the divis
ion of spoils, it was said, led to the
confession. Arrest of a score or more
members of the syndlncate is expect
ed within a week.
The men who confessed are "Dick"
Barrett and Edward J. Thompson, ac
cording to Hinto G. Clabough, head of
the Chicago bureau of the federal de
partment of justice. Both are at lib
erty, he said. They will become wit
nesses for the government, however,
when the eight members of the syndi
cate, arrested in a raid on a fashion
able apartment hotel Sunday night,
are brought to trial.
Operations of the syndicate, which
now appear to hare been of interna
tional proportions, were not confined
to the blackmail of wealthy men and
women, according to information de
veloped today. Among the effects in
the office of "Doc" Edward Donahue,
one of the men caught in the Satur
day night raid on the fashionable
south side apartment house, was sta
tionery of the "United Turf exchange,"
with "headquarters in New York and
offices all over tho world." There
were also cipher codes for deciphering
messages received by wire, telling
what horses to bet on, how much to
bet, what races and positions to play.
Fake newspaper clippings detailing
the wonderful cleanups made by a
young eastern plunger in pool rooms
apparently had been used to lure vlo
tlms.
According to department of justice
officials today, here are some of the
things done by the syndicate:
They fleeced a multimillionaire of
New York out of $40,000 by threaten
ing him with arrest for alleged viola
tions of the Mann act, two of the mem
bers of the syndicate Impersonating
secret service agents for that purpose.
They frightened a wealthy Philadel
phia woman, who had been friendly
with a stranger, into giving them $35,
000.
They took $10,000 from each of five
Chicagoans, two of whom are women.
They brought about their own arrest
by allegedly taking S3.B00 from Mrs.
Reglna Clipper of Philadelphia, and
after kidnaping her.
It was said today that the organiza
tion had worked as a whole since the
first of the year, and it is believed to
have cleaned in that time $1,000,000.
The government officials saflr that for
one known victim of the syndicate
there are probably twenty tnknown.
The eight members of the syndicate
so-called were still in custody today,
awaiting their preliminary hearing be
fore the U. S. commissioner tomorrow.
