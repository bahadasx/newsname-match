The arrival here of .many of the mem

which was 'surrendered "to the Bulgers
without a blow .being struck by the
Oreek general ia command, .and the
subsequent deportation of a large num

fanned the flame of Greek wrath first
against the Bulgarians and the Ger

night that ao government can stand

more than "benevolently neutral" or

The statement continued with the
assertion that the attitude of the
Greek government in other respects,
would be decided only after a careful
examination of the whole situation and
a study of diplomatic documents now
on file.

,. Sir Douglas Haig, commander-in-chief
of tbe British foreea ia France, issued a
statement last sight Heating with the
gains made by the men under his com-,
mand.. He declared that tha operations '
now underway were ' ' most ' important
aad' have beea most successful from .
all points ot view.' .: t -. . ..
The publication of this statement ia- . '
stantly revived the ' reporta of an in-
tended retirement by tha GermansUo
new liae of defense farther to the ,-v
east. Constant reporta from Hollaed of "
late have told Of enormous military '. '
activity behind the. German lines. In
quiries in financial and commercial cir-,
eles in touch with Holland have elicited
the fact that the belief prevails ia that '
country that Germany probably will at- '.
tempt to shorten ber present line ia
tbe West, and that before long.
It is pointed out that if the pressure ..
of the British and French continues
the German line must break at some
point, and it Is insisted that Germaay
is beginning to feel tha seed of more
men or a shorter line to defend. The .
attacks of the Russians ia the East
and of the Allies ia Macedonia are. '
also beginning to tell heavily upon Teu
tonic resources in men and munitions,
great as they still undoubtedly are.
Two Poaalble New lines V
There are two possible lines to which
the German grand command might re
tire,' should such a step be found neces
sary or advisable. One of these is as
far back as Maastricht, whioa ia aita- -ated
on the Dutch frontier aorth of
Liege. It ia believed, however, in Hol
land that if the pressure becomes much
more severe in the East and West Field
Marshal von Hindenburg will suggest a
withdrawal to the line of Antwerp, .
Namur and Meaierea. '
This, of course, would mean surren
dering the whole of western Belgium
and moeh of the portion of northern
France which the Germans now bold,
and the German line would then stand
on tha front of the MeusO and the Ar
dennes, where Oermaa engineers have
beea busy for months preparing for .'
such a contingency. They have been
particularly active about Namnr and
Antwerp, where the fortifications have
been strengthened In every possible
way.
Beports from Holland declare that
the prestige of von Hindenburg with
the people of - Germaay ia to be used
to make such a retirement possible with
out affecting the people too much. It
is believed that the victor of Tannea-
burg could recommend .Such a. move
ment with safety, especially if it
should be accompanied, as It ia believed
it would be, by a deolaratioa that Ger
many will never surrender Antwerp.
Move Would Be Wine One .
rr'tfe here denlsre thst
-iH-i: . in . mi the part 'of f!i rmftnv
would be a wise one. They point out
that by ao doing she would release at
least three-quarters of a million men
for use ia tbe Esst and ia Macedonia,
where heavy pressure is expected and
where the Allies are said to bo forging
ahsad again, after minor reverses at
