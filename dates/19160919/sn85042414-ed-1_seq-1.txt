Effort Being Made to Get
North Dakota Farmers
Interested.
EXPOSITION TO BE
EARLY IN DECEMBER
Itinerary Will Include Full
Day's Entertainment in
South St. Paul.
An endeavor will be made to run
a special train of North Dakota farm
ers and business men to Chicago the
first part of December to take in the
International Live Stock show, De
cember 2 to 9.
IA. very large number of people were
ready to make this tijip in December,
19-15, and some 200 reservations were
made with the committee having this
matter in charge at Grartd Forks
when the outbreak of the foot and
mouth disease brought about the
abandonment of the 1915 show.
'So many inquiries have been re
ceived in the past few weeks asking
If, the trip will be made this year that
lt has been decided to go ahead,
should a sufficient number wish it.
1
The Itinerary will Include a full
day's entertainment at the South St.
Paul stock yards, one day at Madi
son, Wis., or at some well known
dairy farm in Wisconsin, and three
days at the International in Chicago-
The only object of the excursion
•will be the study of live stock con
ditions at close range and under the
most favorable circumstances. The
train will be run over the Great
Northern and the officials of this road
are in hearty sympathy with the idea
and will use every effort to provide
the best of service.
M. C. Bacheller and Don V. Moore
of Grand Forks were chairman and'
secretary, respectively, of last year's
committe and will handle the pre
liminary details at this time. The
committee will consist of well known
men from the towns along the Great
Northern where interest is made
known in the movement.
It is desired to have an expression
from all over the northern part of
the state and in northwestern Minne
sota at a very early date, so that final
arrangements can be made. Those
dqslrlng to go should write or tele
phone at once to Don V. Moore, sec
retary, Grand -Forks, asking for a
sleeper reservation on this train. The
trip, will be made at a cost of not to
exceed $70 based on Grand Forks as
the starting point and will Include,
railway fare,'sleeper accommodations
during the entire trip, dining car
service and entertainment at St. Paul,
Madison and Chicago. The party will
break up at Chicago and come home
at the individual's expense.
•This price of $70 is not official and
will probably be lessened, but will
depend upon the amount and cost of
entertainment provided. The passen
ger department of the Great Northern
will present figures at an early date
showing entire cost from any town in
northern North Dakota and north
western Minnesota.

Washington, Sept. 19.—The British
tanks," the armored motor cars used
in recent assaults on German trenches
in Northern France so successfully as
t° *ttract world-wide attention, w'ere
built for the most part In Peoria, 111.,
in the form of Caterpillar tractors
designed many' years before the war
began to meet some of the difficult
problems of modern farming- Except'
for their armor, their -machine guns
and their crews, thousands like them
are in use today in the United States,
plowing, digging ditches and other
labors less heroic than war.
M. M. Baker, vice president of the
Holt Manufacturing company, ex
plained here yesterday that it was
machines made by his company at its
Peoria pla[nt that had hurdled Ger
man trenches, walked through forests
and crawled over shell craters in the
face of intense gunfire.
"We have sold about l.OjQO caterpil
lar tractors to the British govern
ment," said Mr. Baker. "We have
had nothing to do with putting armor
on them, or placing machine guns,
but some of our men at Aldershot,
England, recently were notified that
the British government Intended to
armor some of the tractors and use
them for work other than the usual
towing of big guns.
"Germany had some of these trac
tors before the war began, and al
though I do not understand just how
it occurred, I believe she may have
got others since then. We have sent
some to France and some to Russia.
So far as I know, up until the recent
appearance of the motor cars the
tractors were used only to tow big
guns. I understood Germany used
about forty of them in this work be
fore Liege early in the war and recent
photographs show that the British are
using some of them now for the same
purpose."
Mr- Baker said he did not know
how many of the 1,000 tractors sent
to England had been armored and put
in service as land battleships, nor did
he know what equipment the British
war office had placed upon cars to be
used in this work.

REVERSES ORDER
Dollar Supplants English
Pound Note in Foreign
Markets.
Paris. Sept. 19.—Max Hoaehlller, in
an article in the Temps contrasts
America's-flnanclal position now in re
spect to .foreign countries with what
it was before the war,- The article
says: ..
.\ ....
"Theh-vtVie Urifted fitates was send
ing to Europe from $260,000,000 to
$300,000,000 in interest on its bor
rowings, $150,000,000 to $200,000,000
spent by tourists, $100,000,000 to
$160,000,000 to expatriates and $20.
000,000 to $40,000,000 in ocean
freights.'
"Since the war, the. United States
has imported $730,000,000 in, gold and
has paid back a considerable amount
of its previous borrowings, increased
its foreign trade by $2,,260,000,000
yearly and loaned to foreign countries
$1,470,000,000. so that the dollar now
has replaced to a. considerable extent
the old sovereignty of the English
pound abroad.
"Whether the United States will re
tain. with her deficient financial or
ganisation, the position recently won,
will depend upon American financial
and commercial policies. The arrival
in France of an American commercial
mission is an indication that Ameri
cans are realizing they must follow
the law in exchanges between coun
tries, buying in general as much as
they sell."

Crookston, Minn., Sept. 19.—At the
coroner's Inquest held this morning
over the remains of Trygve' Randers,
who was killed Sunday noon when
he was struck by an automobile, the
jury returned a verdict of "accidental
death."
George C. Holden of Thompson, N.
D„ driver of the machine which kill
ed Randers, testified this morning
that he was driving at a rate not ex
ceeding eight miles an hour and that
he applied the brakes when he no
ticed the lad and man before his ma
chine.
Holden- was exonerated from all
blame.
The funeral for Randers, who- was
prominent throughout Polk county,
will be held Wednesday afternoon.
WANTS FRANCE TO
ASSUME CUPID ROLE
Paris, Sept. 19.—-A sort of official
matrimonial agency is tha latest ex
pedient proposed by Bugene Brieux
of the French academy to relieve the
anticipated dearth of husbands after
the war.
Eligible parties, he thinks, should
be registered at the city halls, so they
may be brought together.
A more significant suggestion, also
due to M. Brieux. Is the abolition of
the marriage contract and the dower
—the great barrier to the marriage
of the girl without a fortune. Some
believe a romantic period is to set in
In which the dower will get lost in a
great floqd of spontaneous and genu
ine sentiment.

"It is true," said Mr. Baker, "that
these tractors can go ahead over al
most anything or through almost any
thing. They can straddle a trench, go
through a swamp, roll over logs, or
climb through shell craters like a car
of Juggernaut. It looks uncanny to
see them crawl along the ground, Just
like a huge caterpillar. In a. thick
forest, if they encountered trees they
could not brush out of their way, they
could easily be used to uproot them
and clear their own paths."
Mr. Baker said'the tractors sent to
England weigh about IS,000 pounds
each, develop 120 horsepower and are
built of steel. The caterpillar feature,
he explained, is of the utmost import
ance- Speaking broadly, the tractor
crawls on two belts,' with corrugated
surfaces, on either side of the body.
The corrugated surface is oii the
-ground. On the inside of the belts,
on each side of the bodj are two lines
of steel rajls, making four lines in all
These rails are in short sections,
jointed and operate over a cogged
mechanism that actually lies them
down with their belt attachment as
the tractpr moves ahead and picks
them up again so that the car runs
on Its own self made track continu
ously. The short joints in the rails
make It easy to turn to right or left.
The body is supported by trucks with
five wheels, something like small
railroad trucks. These wheels never
touch the ground but run upon, the
steel rails. Mr. Baker said that the
machine would bridge' any trench
that was not wider, than the length
of the track, about seven feet, it laid
on the ground at one time. The
width of track used on the machines
sent to England, Mr. Baker said, was
24 inches- He suggested that the
British authorities probably had
lengthened the track on the tractors
used In trench work, giving them
even greater power to surmount ob
stacles.
Although Mr. Baker would not dis
cuss the matter, it was understood the
United States war department is ex
perimenting with tractors similar to
those now in use on the British line.

Case Against Them Doubt
ful, Says Department of
Justice Official.
MRS. KLIPPER IN
CHICAGO TODAY
Is Expected to Identify Di
rectors of the Organ
ization.
Chicago, 111., Sept. 19.—Four mem
bers of the alleged $1,000,000 band of
blackmailers, may escape prosecu
tion, federal officials admitted, as
they awaited a preliminary hearing,
late today, of the seven prisoners,
taken in a fashionable apartment
hotel raid.
Mrg. Regina Klipper, a divorcee of
Philadelphia, the government's chief
witness, arrived early in the day un
der guard of federal agents to appear
against the alleged blackmailers.
Hinton Clabaugh of the United States
department of justice said he is con
fident Mrs. Klipper would identiry
Edward Donahue. Henry Russell and
Mrs. Helen Evers, as the directors of
the organization.
"Case against the others under ar
rest is doubtful," said Clabuagh. "I
am saltlsfied, however, of the guilt of
the first three."
Chicago, Sept. 19.—While Federal
authorities here prepared to arraign
for preliminary hearing today seven
members of an alleged blackmail
gang who used the Mann act as their
chief weapon, detectives'fortified with
information obtained from two alleg
ed members of the gang who con
fessed, made arrests in- other cities
and spread a dragnet for H. C. Wood
ward, sought as director in chief of
the syndicate.
Hinton G. Clabaugh, of the United
States Department of Justice, declar
ed he had obtained sufficient evidence
to convict the gang without exposing
the names of any of their wealthy vic
tims. It was understood that none of
the names of the victims would be
bared at the hearing. These victims,
principally wealthy men whose flirta
tions with pretty women led them in
to traps from which they escaped on
ly on payment of large sums, will'be
shielded from publicity, except as a
last resort, it is said.
The evidence obtained In two cases
already- generally known, -authorities
«I4, together with, a mass of lncrini
ififtiiftg evidence found in the raid on
tne apartment where the seven* were
arrested, will be presented to a Fed
eral commissioner- Clabaugh expects
the seven will be ordered removed to
Philadelphia tor trial.
Developments in the case reported
to Clabaugh yesterday included the
arrest at New Tork of Frank Crock
er, alleged former member of the
gang, who is said to have confessed to
a part in the swindling of Mtb. Re
gina Klipper of Philadelphia, and the
arrest at Philadelphia of William
Butler, held there in connection with
an alleged blackmail plot against the
late Mrs. Susan A. S. Winpenny.
Clabaugh also revealed today the
source of the information that led to
the raid.. He said, "Dick" Barrett
arid Edward J. Thompson, two mem
bers of the syndicate, had confessed.
They probably will be given Immunity.
The seven under arrest here, four
men and three women, may seek their
release on bond, It was said by
Charles E. Erbsteln, their counsel.
The bonds total approximately $100,
000.
The men refused to talk, but the
women scouted the charges.
Mrs. Helen Evers, said by Federal
authorities to have been used as the
"lure" In the bogus Mann act cases,
stamped her feet and said there was
not a word of truth in the charges.
"Why I never smoked opium in my
life," she said, indignantly denying
that an opium outfit was found in her
room.
Mrs. Frances Chapman said noth
ing. Mrs. Evers said Mrs. Chapman's
arrest was an outrage—that she was
just visiting at the apartment.
Mrs- Edward Donohue, older than
the other women, maintained her dig
nity even in Jail. "Ridiculous: too
ridiculous, even to deny," she said.
Edward Donohue, husband of the
woman, is one of those held in heavl
est ball, $25,444. Mrs. Evers' bail is
also $25,000, as is that of Henry Rus
sell. These three, authorities said,
were the principals in the plot. The
others, whose bonds were set at $5,
000 each, Mrs. Donohue, Mrs. Chap
man, George Bland and James Chris
tian, were assistants. It Is charged.
The bond of Frank Crocker, who,
though under arrest In New Tork,
was at first announced as held here,
also has been tentatively set at $5,000.
George Irwin, said to be the hus
band of Mrs. Evers, and .Woodward
are being sought throughout the
country- Irwin, the authorities say,
was arrested last June on a blackmail
charge, held in $6,000 bond but has
di»aDT»»n-'d'. He is believed to be in
New Tork. y.
