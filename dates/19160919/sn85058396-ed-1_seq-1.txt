Mighty Conflict.
'TANKS" IN ACTION
Mighty Monsters of British
Army Are Big Show

British TTronf In Ptaupp. Sonf IS
Via London, Sept 19. 6:30 a. m.
The most dramatic and picturesque
battle of the British army in all its
two years in France was fought on
September 15. Here is the story of
how all kinds of men from the ends
of the earth took part in this mighty
conflict.
In the same dressing station this
week the correspondent of the Asso
ciatd Press has seen Canadian, New
Zealanders, English, Scotch, Irish,
New Foundlahders and Americans.
There were some of the men of many
countries who took part in the now
historic battle and with them there
went Into action those armored motor
cars, called "tanks," which are to the
credit of a quiet officer of engineers.
When the correspondent met this of
ficer in London six months ago and
asked him what job he was now on
he replied, "Sh! don't tell." It was
the tanks that completed the wonder
ful business of the battle. Today
when the correspondent was calling
on a Canadian brigadier, it was a
"tank," rough looking like a prehis
toric monster in a skin of modern
armor and with engines inside, whfch
took him across the field of shell,
craters, weaving Its way-with pytnoriic
adaptability by irregularities up to
the door of the brigadier's dugout.

HUGHES SPEAKS
IN ILLINOIS
Attends State Convention and
'Speaks at the State
, Fair.
Peoria, Ills., Sept 19. Charles E.
Hughes, opening his second campaign
trip in an address here, character
ized the Democratic party as "a party
of broken promises, which now pre
sents extravagant claims."
The nominee took up point after
point touched upon in President Wil
son's speech of acceptance and de
clared " the claims made therein were
extravagent and that nothing of the
sort had been accomplished.''
T believe," Mr. Hughes said, "that
credit should be given where credit
is due, but I think it important that
no man should claim to have done
what he has not done."
Peoria, Ills., Sept. 19. Republican
leaders of Illinois assembled here to
day to attend the Republican state
convention and listen to Charles E.
Hughes open his second speech mak
ing command in the central western
states.
The Republican presidential candi
dates was scheduled to arrive in Chi
cago on his special train at 9:30 a. m.
and address tho convention before
noon. He Is to leave for Springflold,
acompanied by several hundred of the
state leaders and a majority of the
delegates after the convention ad
journs. At Sprinfleld this afternoon Mr.
Hughes will doliver the principal ad
dress at tho Republican day cere
monies at tho Illinois Stato Fair, and

in the evening speak at a mass meet
ing to be held at the stato arsenal.
"Our opponents present a record of
broken promises. They promised to
reduce the cost of living. They have
not touched it.
Democrats Are Extravagant.
"They promised to prevent waste
and extravagance. They have been
more extravagant in the recent con
gress, as I am informed, on unim
peachable authority, than any preced
ing congress.
"Our opponents promised to apply
the principles of the merit system.
They haVe betrayed the morit system.
"Our oponents promised to reduce
useless offices. Instead they have ap
pointed useless offices.
Opponents Shamelessly Fall.
"Our opponents promised that tho
rights of American citizens should be
maintained throughout the world, tho
rights with respect to rights and
property. They have shamelessly
failed to perform that promise.
"Acts are facts and extravagant
claims cannot deceive the intelligent
voter.
"Our opponents claimed they have
clarified the anti-trust law by defini
tion. I may say, here and now, that
they have done nothing of the sort.
Ihey claim to have recuperated the
merchant marine. They have dono
nothing of the sort.
Federal Reserve Act.
"The federal reserve act, as en
dorsed by the administration and pre
sented to congress, was a wholly un
workable bill. It was finally worked
out by students and others until it
emerged in a different form, but that
system as it is, contains dangerous
possibilities of inflation.
"Our opponents claim to have eman
cipated child labor. As a body they
have not emancipated child labor. If
our opponents are genuinely devoted
to the interests of children let them
act In states under their control and
there will be no child labor problem
in the United States.
Republicans for Conservative Policies.
"The Republican party stands for
conservative policies. First of all we
proposed to protect American rights
on land and Bea, at home and abroad.
We have no secret intrigues. We have
no purposes unstated in the light of
day. We propose that American
rights shall be treated with respect by
every nation in the world, great or
small.
"Let us bo fair. I do not deny to
our opponents any reasonable credit
for what thoy have done, but I pro
test against them taking Republican
work and, after they first had pre
pared an unworkable program, de
manding extravagant credit from the
country for aiding business by build
ing upon Republican foundation.
Extraordinary Claims Made.
"It is said that American business
has been aided and it is tho most ex
traordinary claim of all by the pas
sage of the Underwood bill. Thero is
the true relation of our opponents to
our American enterprise. It was a
bill which closed factories, halted in
dustry and sent forth our workingmen
in hundreds of thousands upon the
streets looking for employment.
"And aid to business yes, that Is
the conception our opponents have of
what is an aid to American industry.
The sooner we believe in the Repub
lican doctrine of protection to Amer
ican industry, the sooner we will lay
tho basis for enduring prosperity in
this country."
Mr. Hughes' speech here was before
the Republican state convention. After
leaving the convention hall ho went
to a hotel where he held a half-hour
hand-shaking reception.
Mr. Hughes left at 12:20 P. m. for
Springfield, 111.

Members.
Chicago, Sept. 19. That- some of

ary hearing set for 2 p. m. of the
seven prisoners taken in tho fashion
able apartment hotel raid.
Miss Virginia Klipper, a divorcee of
Philadelphia, the government's chief
witness, arrived early in the day un
der guard of federal agents to appear
against the alleged blackmailers. Hln
ton C. Clabaugh of the United States
department of justice said he was con
fident Mrs. Klipper would Identify
Henry Donahue, Henry Russell and
Mrs. Helen Evers as directors of the
syndicate.

baugh said, "is doubtful." "I am sat
isfied, however, of the guilt of the
first three."

are held under bail of ?25,000 each.
The others under arrest are James
Christian, James Bland, Mrs. Donahue
and Mrs. Francis Allen, alias Chap

ported to be less than $5000 and some
jewelry and later kidnaped and held
prisoner In Montreal when she threat

of several members of the alleged
blackmail syndicate arrested in a f ed
"eral raid here, and possible continu
ance of their preliminary hearing, was

eastern cities arrived In Chicago to
testify against the gang.
James Christian, one of the four
men arrested with three women in the
raid here, was freed on bond late last
night. His bail was reduced from
$5,000 to $2,500 when officials admit
ted they had little evidence to connect
him with the alleged fleecing of Mrs.
Reglna Klipper of Philadelphia, the
principal witness against the gang
The bail of three other members of
the gang may be reduced today. The
alleged leaders, however, will be held
under $25,000 bond each unless United
States Commissioner Footo before
whom they will be arraigned, can be
prevailed upon by Charles Erbsteln,
their counsel, to reduce them. These
three are Helen Evers, tho socalled

Mrs. Klipper was expected in Chi
cago today to testify at the hearing,
which was set for 2 p. m. Erbsteln
planned a strenuous efforts to secure
reduction of ball for all his clients.
Tho federal authorities hero yester
day, It was learned today, were be
sieged by wealthy women and men
who claimed to have been victims
of the gang and who pleaded that
their names be kept out of tho case,
They woro given to understand, it is
said that no names would bo revealed
unless absolutely necessary to secure
convictions.

MEXICANS ADMIT
SPITE JHEASURES
Order Leading to Closing
Banks in Mexico City
Were Retaliatory.
New London, Conn., Sept. 19. The
Mexican members of the joint Mexican-American
commission admitted to
the American representatives today
that the order leading to tho closing
of the National Bank and the Bank
of London and Mexico In Mexico City
was in large measure retaliatory. The
order provided that the banks must
show a metallic reserve sufficient to
cover the issue of bank notes, dollar
for dollar.
Tho discussion of tho commission
ers was confined almost entirely to
tho banking question, the border sit
uation being considered only incident
ally. The Mexican representatives
explained that certain banking houses,
especially the two that had closed,
had persistently embarasscd the ad
ministration by reactionary tactics
tending to cause a depreciation of the
Carranza currency.
Tho commissioners went aboard
one of the American submarines this
afternoon and cruised along the
Thames river and the mouth of the
harbor.
