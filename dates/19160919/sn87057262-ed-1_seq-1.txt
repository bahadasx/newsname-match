[By Perry Arnold. United Press Staff
Correspondent]
PEORIA, 111., Sept. -19.—Nominee
Hughes chose Peoria as the city from
which he should burl forth today the
first speech of his second presidential
campaign tour. He spoke in the hall
in which the state republican confer
ence was meeting and in an hour's
sermon on the nation's deeds and
future, enunciated practically every
one of his doctrines on Americanism,
a protective tariff, adequate laws
covering labor and fair treatment to
legitimate business.
The G. O. P. candidate was plainly
pleased to get back to campaigning
again. He started with a smile at
the crowd which greeted him at the
station, waved his hat in almost
Rooseveltian glee at those who ap
plauded him or. the street and in
voice and gesture at the Coliseum
exhibited a full measure of "pep."
There was very little "frazzle" in
his voice and plenty of ginger in h'ls
upper cuts at the air as he. rammed
home his criticisms of the democratic
administration.
at Bridgehampton he had planned.
Saturday he gave over to reading of
data collected and arranged for him
by Secretary Laurence H. Green and
to arrangement in his mind of the
facts shown thc-rein. The former jus
tice sticks to his judicial system of
preparation—long and cloBe reading

—possibly of hours—and then he is
ready to talk, with not any notes to
aid his memory. He was able to get

Bridgehampton a&d yesterday, during
the all day trip to Illinois, he snatch
ed an opportunity to digest For al
most the entire day he was in his
"study" as Mrs. Hughes has named
it, in the private car "National," in
dustriously conning over notes and
just thinking.
The governor—or rather Mr.
Hughes—has turned one of the four
state rooms in his private car into a
sort of work shop. The first state
room from the end is his bed room
the second his "study the third the
"parlor," and the fourth, Mrs.
Hughes' bed room. Mrs. Hughes
named them all herself and super
jrised the arrangements for the gov
ernor's comfort. The new private car
is an all-steel one finished inside in
a warm, light green shade about
which Mrs. Hughes is enthusiastic be
cause it gi'/es what she calls a
"homey warm look." In fact Mrs.
Hughes is mightily pleased over
everything connected with the present
trip mainly because up to the
minute she nad not expected to be
able to accompany her husband. But
she felt he needed her on the strenu
ous days of campaigning he faces in
this Journey through the middle west
and so she managed to get the
Hughes children all fixed up as to
school.

republican nominee intends to make

which supplied the British with the
engines for the armored fighting mon
sters, has contracted to build the
huge tractors for this government
Colonel Rice of the ordnance de
partment, explained today that while
these tractors could easily be turned
into land dreadnoughts similar to the
British "tanks," it is unlikely this
will be done.
"Conditions here would not call for
such engines of war," said Colonel
Rice. "In the first place, It is not
likely that war in America would de
velop into trench warfare because
of the enormous distances, except
where it would be confined to local
territories."
The tractors bought for the United
States army are to be used to haul
big guns. They will be armored and
probably will carry rapid fire rifles,
but more for defense than offense.
They are much similar to the ordin
ary farm tractors, except that they
are more powerfully constructed.

LONDON Sept.' 19—ttreaJt battles between whole flteets of lanld dreadnoughts may re

"In one short hour," the correspondent wired, "the tanks did more military service

"It may be that before this war is done, we, the Germans and all the allies alike, shall

Vn-nH battles of whole fleets of dreadnoughts and terrestrial monsters."
Only one of the "tanks" was destroyed in the Somme fighting, it Was learned today.
In the center of Bouleaux wood, where fierce fighting occurred, one of the monsters lies
with its nose in the earth between the opposing lines, forming a barricaldie for both British

Some of them fell beneath other
automobiles or the heels of horses
and received serious injuries.
A Third avenue car operated by a
strike breaker jumped the track and
crashed into r. telegraph pole. A

LONDON, Sept.
19.—Allied
troops
have crossed the Serbian frontier at
two places and are advancing against
the Bulgarian base at ^Monastir.
Serbian soldiers are fighting on
their native soil for the first time
since their retreat through Albania
last winter. They have captured a
series of heights from the Bulgars at
Kamakchalan and have crossed the
Serbo-Greek border north of Lake
Ostxovo.
French and Russian troops are en
gaged with the Bulgars near Kenale,
on Serbian territory. Practically all
the territory conquered by the Bul­!
garian right wing in the recent in
vasion of Greece has already been re
captured by the Serbs, French and
Russians.
The Bulgars have made almost no
strong stand since their first strong
defensive positions Were wrecked by
French and Serbian artillery. They
have moved steadily northward in
retreat excepting at Fiorina where
they offered stubborn resistance, but
were again defeated by French and
Russian forces.

Defacto government troops, from
Chihuahua have' abandoned the chase
of the "fox of the Sierras." In the
meantime new troops from Monterey
and other points south are being

opportunity.

that it was defended by heavy artil
lery and a gairison of 7,000 men.
Despite this strength. Villa, after
openly boasting he would attack the
city. Independence day, made good
his threat, entered the town, released
prisoners and withdrew, carrying
away ammunition and supplies and
taking
with him more than a thou
