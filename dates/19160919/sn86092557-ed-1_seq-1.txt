Kfe* Seven applicants were refused at
; ' the Mayor's office this afternoon who
c, " came In to see the burgomaster to get
ft < permission to erect signs across
K..' streets In the city. This action was
retaken by business men who feel that
as long as the city ordinance which
Mm> prohibits the erection of Blgns across
B" the streets has been disregarded by
.the members of the Wilson club who
h... 'put a streamer across Main street
W' svery man In the city should be allowJ
: sd to do so.
Mayor Anthqny Bo wen when asked
regarding the sign stated that he will
see that It Is taken down "some time"
but not on the Impulse of the moment.
The Wilson club doesn't know who
put the sign up but figure that Mooney
the painter who lettered the sign Is
responsible. Acting on this hint the
fc ' Mayor has been hunting Mooney, who
he has been unable to locate. The
[r Mayor says he will not tell his pollcel|&
men to go and take the sign down as
K? - he wants to see that those who put it
1??' up are pleased with whatever action
|?L- he takes.

stretches across Main street from the
Wfi 'Wilson club headquarters to the Trust
If?;.' tompany bank.
Hj&: Ordinance number 13 of the city
tfc- laws state plainly that such signs are
ER ' forbidden and that any sign of what

That Exist At
National Capital
AH attendance records for Marlon
county political gatherings were broken
at the Republican Rally held yesterday
in the court house and the
opening address of the West Virginia
Campaign delivered by Senator William
E. Borah of Idaho, was heard by
fully one thousand men and women.
The circuit court room was filled,
some seals having as many as two
persons in them while the doorwiys
and all the available aisle space was
filled by thOBe who were compelled to
stand. The doors and corridors outside
were filled and the entire upper
floor of the court house was crowded
with those who arrived late and were
compelled to stand outside where they
could hear but not see. And there
was great enthusiasm and a display
of interest that was quite flattering to
the speakers.
One particularly noticeable feature
of the Rally was the large number of
prominent Democrats who were present.
Practically all of the local coun
ty and city officials together with the
local Democratic candidates and many
or me reacting campaign woruers connected
with the many headquarters
offices which are established here
could be discerned at various lnconsplclous
places in the audience.
These men, many of whom had
come to see what fallacies or exaggerations
they might find in Senator
Borah's argument or what loophole
he might leave vulnerable that they
might seize upon it as a weak place
to make their attack on h<s speech
and the party, remained, not to scoff
and And fault, but to sit spellbound
and squirm uncomfortably ir. their
seats as he vividly and with forceful
emphasis in a straightforward, frank

Rare Personal Charm of thi

(By FRED S. KING.)
CHARLESTON. W. Va? Sept. 19.?
Stimulating tbe West Virginia voters
with bis preachments on Republican
doctrloes and inspiring them with a
variety of emotions such as were formerly
characteristic of the campaigns
of Harrison and McKinley, Ira E.
Robinson, the Republican standard
bearer in West Virginia', is credited
with being In the midst of one of the
most effective campaigns ever waged
by a gubernatorial candidate in West
Virginia.
Not since the days which preceded
his tenure of supreme court Judgeship, i
has the Taylor county statesman been
able to get tbe campaign swing .into
his work. He is injecting the paprika,
is demonstrating a versatility surpris- {
ing even to some of his. friends, and
demonstrating every place he goes
that he is equal to all occasions. He
suits himself to the surroundings, has
something different to say to every
man and women he meets. And by the i
way, it is surprising the number of
women who volunteer the declaration i
that they are "for" htm.
But no more surprising are these assertions
from the women than are
