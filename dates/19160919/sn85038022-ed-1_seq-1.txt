MIKE BROWN
Maysvllle is (o have anodier loose
haf tobacco warehouse, and it la to
bo run by men who are up In O In the
tobacco business, too.
Yesterday Meagre. It. In Turner,
ROfcMl Wells, I). K. Wood, H. H. Wood
and Thomas A. Keith, Jr., took over
the Adams County, Ohio Ixiose Leaf
Tobacco Company's holdings at Man
tkoOtOT, including the large warehouse
at that place, which Is 140x210 fee!,
and It will be dismantled and removed
to this city and placed on the lot at
the head of Hank street on Front
street. In the Fifth Ward.
This movement for the establish
ment of another loose leaf warehouse
here has been under way for several
months. The gentlemen interested In
the move started out to get a ware
house established in time for the open
ing of the l!lfi season, and the takinr
over of the Manchester plant means
that they will be successful.
The location of the new warehouse
is the best Of any in the city, accord
ing to old tobacco men. In (ne nrst
place it is out of the tobacco district
as now established by the seven ware
houses Knst of Commerce street, and i
the tlrst one on the drive to that dis
trict going east. This means thr.t
about three-fourths of the tonacco
hauled into Mayaville by turnpikes
will come to the new one llrst on the
jcurtiey to market, as It is just one
snuare nearer the center of the city
The promoters figure that a certain
per cent of the growers have hereto
fore been seeking a shorter drive, and
their new warehouse will supply this
want.
All the men Interested in the new
enterprise are thorough tobacco men
they know the business both by experi
ence from the tlrst planting tnrougn
Its growing and curing process to the
marketing of it. Col. It. U Turner,
grower himself in the Mayslick pre
cinct and for three years a stockholder
and O 01 Cr of the Central Warehouse,
is known all over this section b) the
growers and buyers as a man thor
oughly capable of liandliim a ware
house to the best interests of the
farmers; Mr. Robert Wells has speni
all his life in the tobacco business
and knows it from beginning to end:
tile Mcssre. Wood were Iiorn am'
raised on a Mason county farm and
were tutored In the school of experi
ence when raising tobacco meant
something to the growers, and Mr
Thomas A. Keith. Jr., went througl.
three years of experience in the Con
tial Warehouse here, where he be
came an adapt in the business; so we
see at a glance the new house has a
roster of men that actually know the
business, which means much to the
growers hereabouts.
The promoters give assurances that
the new house will be ready for busi
ness when the bell gives the signal
for the 1U1C season to open, and they
will make a strong pull for all the
business that can be induced to come
to this house.
This one will make eight loose leaf
warehouses in this city, which meaiiJ
that there will be more tobacco soul
lu re this season than ever before, as
they propose to not only move the
warehouse from Adams county, but to
britm its business as well, and as this
year's crop is the largest ever pro
duced urouud here, it is a foregone
conclusion that the sales on this mar
ket will be carefully taken care of by
the warehouses here
