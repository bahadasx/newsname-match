j William H. Comley, Jr.. representing
''Knapp. . ' 1 i
"I , To Ms surprise Judge Comley did
. .jiot urge the motion for change of
" venue but Instead asked for a post--nement
of the case. ' . i t
.first reason was that he and
-.jjiia assovte. Judge Carl Foster, were
uir.ot prei'.ed to try the case at tbi
Jtime. He said many counts ortgin
's4iy brought against Knapp had been
i .Btrickea out" and nw counts, suheti
.tuted.', It was also blalmed that all
v the Burr & Knapp books and in fact
. cvery scrap of paper belonging to the
'Snn had been in the custody of At-
('', torney S. D. Bowers, who is assisting
i ..the state's attorney. " This situation
made It difficult for the lawyers to
iso ' over the books and prepare the
. Then .Judge Comley taof up" the
question of Mrs.- Rahm's attaence. He
f tUd be had talked with tier at her
i jurooklyn home. Because of the ln-
fantile paralysis epidemic she did not
Uinre brlnsr her Ave months old child
.V to this city. ; In fact, she absolutely
' Refused to come Into i this state at

Ro testify, she declared, when home
l 'conditions were favorable. '
y-Jt-As there Is no law which can com

fufy Judge Comley said the problem
. iwas difficult. Mrs. Bahm for years
' (bad charge of the Burr St Knapp
I (books and her testimony Is regarded
4y the state and also by Knapp' coun
' :2el as the most important In the ea
; -fm case. 1
answer to Judge Comleys 'plea
The state's attorney said the argument
ijthat the defense had not sufficient
V'"Hme to prepare did not sound con-
ojng. The oencn warrant tor
iapp'8 arrest was issued last spring
nd ample time had elapsed to give
ounsel for the accused opportunity
o collect material for the defense.
Attorney Cummin gs declared the
state was very anxious to try the ease.
LAn adjournment would be more
(burdensome for. 'the slate than1 the
I dense Decause numerous wicnrases
rom other states had been notified
J mo come to this city and. It was doubt
ul if some of these persons would
fcome at a later date. He suggested
hat Mrs. Rahm's deposition 'could be
. itaken vn tsroojuyn. '
Judge Tuttle remarked that deposi
' itlons in an important case of this
rikind were tmsatslfactoTy. He thought
(the. only reascto for a postponement
(Would be In the absence of Mrs. Rahm.
I JAs her testimony was regarded as Im
J (prfFtant by both sides' he did not
(think it advisable for the trial to start
I funM every chance had been given
both the state and the defense to pre
I cent all available evidence.
, He asked the state's attorney about
. m. postponement until the December
(term but Attorney Cummings replied
ui wna v. diiui i. icim any as ixio
', Xnapp trial probably would be a long
B one It would be inconvenient to have
i' Jt interrupted by the Christmas holi
j days. Judge Tuttle then said he
' Would make a Xppeclal assignment in
Ufovember.
', :, Tho state's attorney in-quired what
I - ad become of the motion for a chanif e
fit venue. He said the "starts had gone

ASK INTERPRETATION
OF KERN AMENDMENT
Three Bridgeport Institu
- tions Seem to Come Un
der Ner , Ruling , 1
Radical changes in the directorate
of some of the most prominent bank
ing Institutions of this city are likely
to occur on or before Oct. 15, as the
outcome of "a decision by the Federal
reserve board as to what constitutes
'substantia' competition" under the
Clayton la prohibiting interlocking
directorates
" The reserve board has decided, ac
cording to despatches from Washing
ten, that . any two banks having re
sources to the amount ef $5,000,000
or more shall sot have interlocking di
rectorates It is known that one institution in
this city has as many as seven di
rectors who are also directors in other
national banks or trust companies,
'. An effort is now being made to as
certain from the Federal Reserve
board of directors in a national bank
also on the directorate of a trust com
pany !bank may not be classed beyond
the pale of the ruling because of tiie
different character of the business
transacted. i
X In the event of the application be
ing denied it ill necessitate imme
diate revision of the directorates of at
least thee banks In this city. Banks
all over the United States will be
similarly affected. --
Charles Q. Sanford. president of the
First-Brt dg-epcrt National ibank,. and
a director in the Federal Reserve
bank said .today:
"Referring to the Clayton act, it
is possible that it will affect the
.directorates of three banks in Bridge
port the First-Bridgeport National
'bank, the Connecticut National bank
and the Bridgeport Trust Co.
"Several directors from the two
national banks are directors .in the
Bridgeport Trust Co. The Kern
amendment to tlhe Clayton act prop
lVides that these directors may serve
in two Honks, provtaeu trie Banks are
not in 'substantial competition'. 1
"Applications have been filed with
the Federal reserve board by some
of the national bank directors in
Bridgeport, requesting permission to
serve on their own board and also
on the board of the Bridgeport' Trust
Co. The ground for, this request, is
that the business of the trust com
pany is radically different in character
from that of the national banks and
th7the trust company ley not in
substantial competition' under the
law. ' i
"These applications probably will
be determined within a very few
days." , v '

of America's foremost scientists, ctom
prlsing the navy's civil consulting

elm tree in the yard. He was asked
to inspect the electrical wiring of the
house which he tried, pronouncing it
safe.
Secretary Daniels formally wel

MILK PRODUCERS
REAOY TO FIGHT
PASTEURIZATION
Southwestern Connecticut
Dairy Farmers Meet In
x Hawleyville. ,
DIRECTOR NAMED ,
FROM EACH TOWN
Board Will Meet in Danbury
Saturday With Authority
to Elect Officers -
(Special to The Farmer.)
:HawleyvIHe, Conn., Sept. 19 Or
ganisation of the Western Connecticut
Milk Producers' association was effect
ed at a largely attended meeting 6f
dairy farmers and others interested in
dairy products, in this railroad center
yesterday afternoon.
While.no definite steps were taken
against -the proposed compulsory
pasteurization of milk sold in Bridge
port, the sentiment of the meeting, as
reflected by the speakers, and evi
denced in the Uif ortnal discussions
growing out of te meeting, proved to
be strongly against pasteurization,
especially against pasteurization done
privately. -
If the city of Bridgeport provides a
municipal pasteurization plant, the
opposition will, not be so strong. But
even then, well informed dairymen de
clare, there will be a feeling ofj re
sentment and a sentiment that the city
imposing- a needless hardship upon
the dairy farmer.
The meeting yesterday was for or
ganization. Between 50 and 60
names were pledged. Great interest
was manifested. The chief business
of the meeting was the organization
of a board of directors';- one from each
town1 in Southwestern Connecticut.
This board is vested with power to
elect officers of the association, and
when the directors n;et in Danbury,
on Saturday, this will be done. C. F.
Nichols of Stepney, a former member
of the state legislature from Monroe,
acted as cler,k of the meeting. .
Pasteurization was the chief theme
of the several speakers, including
Nujxora x. otoaaaxa ol vv uouunuge, ui
the State Board of Agriculture; prof.
H. F. Judklns of Storrs' Agricultural
College, and S. J. Wright of the Fair
field County Farm bureau. ' , .'
One, of the larger dealers, who sup
ples 2i6 customers, reported that he,
had made a canvas of his customers,
and had found that only eight of his
entire trade preferred pasteurized
milk. The meeting yesterday includ
ed 60 producers, with atotal of 700
cows. 1 ,
There was criticism at the meeting
of the statements purporting to come
from the bacteriological laboratory
recently instituted by the City of
Bridgeport, to the effect that "Bridge
port .milk is rotten." The; dealers de
clare 'that these general statements
are unfair that there must be some
samples submitted that are better
than others, and that to condemn all
is to discriminate unjustly against the
dealer who conscientiously strives to
produce wholesome milk.
The question also was raised as to
the showing made by certain samples
of pasteurized milk that had been
tested at the labA-atory. It was ar
gued that the laboratory was strangely
silent when questions were asked as
to the showing of the pasteurized pro
duct. The (board o directors of the asso
elation includes:

Fairfield Field Looks Like
War Scene When Argu
ment Is Over.
Modern warfare with its starshellsn
and hand-to-hand combats in the
trenches was emulated on a small
scale recently ih Fairfield, and yester
day the details .of the struggle were
told in Judge Bacon Wakeman's town
court.
Two weeks ago, according to tes
timony offered, Andrew Soss defeated
a main body of the Allies' sympathiz
ers while searching for a detachment
of three.
Soss entered Casper Schick's cafe
at Ash Creekjtwo weeks ago Saturday
night for refreshment, ' after a hard
day's labor in a Bridgeport siop. He
had been there but a short time when
argument on the war abroad began.
His opponents are said to be " three
Polish-speaking men. After a slight
skirmish in which the four partici
pated while exponents of many other
nationalities stood passively by, Soss
was vanquished. He swore vengeance,
and to await him the three Polish
speaking men took seats on a stone
all above the safe on the Fairfield
turnpike. Merely as spectators to the
coming freight eight sympathizers
with the allies took observation seats
on the opposite side of the roadway.
Soss, who save his addressas Fair
field avenue. Bridgeport disappeared
in the darkness for about 10 min
utes. When he returned he had
a rifle and It is alleged he was ac
companied by one other individual
bearing a flashlight, whose name has
not been learned.
In the inky darkness Soss admits
he mistook the side of the road on
which the coming battle wa3 to be
staged. Witnesses declare that there
was a flash of light, followed by a
dull thud. There was a second flash
of light, a whang and another dull
thud, continued by at least two more
flashes and thuds, followed by groans.
The light disappeared and Soss was
seen no more.. Half an hour later
Schick's saloon took the. form of an
improvised field hospital The first
on the casualty list was John Udis
ky, whose head was split open from
his forehead to the rear of his cra
nium. He had crawled to the sa
loon nearly an hour after Soss' de
parture. Insensible behind. a fence
In the field, the others were found.
It is understood that only one of
eight -Innocent bystanders had escap
ed the telling blows from the rifle butt
wielded by Soss In the light of the
torch.
In court last week upon the com
plaint of TJdlsky, Soss was fined $5
and costs and sentenced to 10 days
In jail, which he served. Yesterday
two additional complaints against
Soss were heard. Georare Baker and
Frank Diskey, both of Fairfield. A
fine of $1 and costs was imposed by
Justice Wakeman thougih Attorney
Abe Geduldig argued that Soss had
already received enough punishment
It Is expected thatour others who
suffered In the fray may yet be heard
from.

Alive, Say Delegates at
New Haven.
New Haven, Sept 19 A number of
Progressive party members met here
today to discuss political conditions as
they relate to their party, to choose a
state 'fcfealrman to fill the vacancy
which came about by the resignation
of Joseph W. Alsoprof Avgon, to elect
a treasurer and to plan for the cam
paign. The call was Issued by J. B.
Smith, of Orange. The number of
members who had responded at nopn
was not large. Most of them were
men who took prominent part In the
Progressive campaigns of 1912 and
1914 in Connecticut.
F. M. Chase, who had charge of the
Progressive state headquarters In
Hartford, four year ago, looked in
upon the gathering. The guest of
the day was Bainbrldge Colby, of New
York, who was met by a delegation
upon his arrival.
The Progressives sat down to lunch
about 1 o'clock and later they were to
meet to discuss party affairs. Several
members said they did not believe any
suggestion would be offered to put a
ticket in the field or to come out for
endorsement of any candidate of any
other party. The main idea wtuld be
to continue the organization against a
time when it might be needed.
As ' to endorsement of any candi
date of the Democratic or Republican
party, members pointed out that they
felt it to be 'wisdom to adhere to the
sentiment of the Indianapolis confer
ence which was to let every Progress
ive use his own judgment this fall.
Mr. Colby was to address the meet

DENNIS J. GAYNOR
PASSES AWAY AT
AGE 0FJ5EVENTY
Prominent Manufacturer
Dead After Illness of
Many Weeks.
Dennis JGaynor, president of the
Gaynor - Manufacturing Co., and for
many years a respected resident of
this city, died this afternoon at his
home, . 971 'Broad street, . Stratford.
Death followed 'an illness of several
weeks duration and was due to a
complication of ailments. Mr. Gay
nor had been gradually sinking for the
paist two weeks and his life was de
spaired of for several days.' This
. morning he suffered another sinking
spell and his family was summoned.
They were at the bedside when the
end, came at 3 o'clock this afternoon.
Despite his' 70 years, Mr. Gaynor
was active In business until last July.
He was daily at the factory of tho
Gaynor Manufacturing .Co., and his
entire working day was devoted to
actual supervision of manufacturing
processes in the factory. (
In July Mr. Gaynor was taken 111
and was prevailed upon to retire from
active business. Since that time he
remained at his home in Stratford,
and has been under a physician's care
for most of the time. His wonderful
vitality enabled him to fight off" the
Illness for many weeks before taking
to his bed. ' .
Mr. Gaynor was born in Barana
darah, Queens .County, Ireland, on
August 24, 1846. He was the son of
John and Mary (Mulhall) Gaynor. He
came to America with his parents at
the age of four, first settling in Union
ville, N. Y. Two years later his fam
ily removed to Waterbury.
In Waterbury, Mr. Gaynor learned
the brass business, and became promi
nent in that industry. ' His genial per
sonality and splendid character were
soon recognised by his townsfolks and
for three (successive terms he was
elected city treasurer.
In. 1874 he was married to Miss
Chariotte Gibson, of Waterbury. Ten
children were born to this union, or
whom six survive. In 1887, Mr. Gay
nor removed to Bridgeport, where he
.founded the Gaynor-Mitcaell Co. .man
ufacturers of brass goods, then located
at Oak and George streets.
This company was reorganized a
few years ago as the Gynor Manu
facturing Co. ' A new' factory was
built in Stratford, and it was that ht
might be nearer to his business that
Mr. Gaynor removed to that town
two years ago.
During his long- residence In this
city, Mr. Gaynor earned the friendship
and respect of a wide circle of ac
quaintances. Though a llfe-ldng Dem
ocrat, Mr. Gaynor did not seek public
honors in this city, his political activi
ties being confined to those of an earn
est worker for his party.
Surviving Mr. Gaynor are his wife,
a brother, John F. Gaynor, and a sis
ter, Mrs. Mary Brown, residing at 97Z(
Noble avenue: two daughters. Miss
Charlotte R. Gaynor of Stratford, and
Mrs. William A. Styles,: of Montreal;
and four sons, Arthur C. Gaynor, of
Bridgeport; Frank A. Gaynor, a law
yer of New 'York; Joseph F. Gaynor,'
of Bridgeport; and Edwin C. Gaynor
of Stratford. Arthur, Joseph and Ed
win Gaynor were associated with their
father in the Gaynor Manufacturing
company.

New Haven Delegates
Pledge Support to Bridge
port Candidate.
Judge Morris B. Beardsley, of
Bridgeport, will be nominated for gov
ernor by the Democratic state conven
tion which will hold its opening ses
sion this evening at Music hall. New
Haven. The nominations will be made
tomorrow.
Attorney Charles S. Canfleld, of
this 'city, will present Judge Beards
ley's name to the convention and
there will bo, several seconding
speeches. It is probable that Judge
Beardsley's name will have no oppo
sition and that the nomination will be
by acclamation. New Haven Demo
crats, at their city convention last
night, instructed their 25 delegates for
Judge Beardsley.
It Is understood that Former Gov.
Simeon E. Baldwin will nominate Na
tional Committeeman Homer S. Cum-
mlngs, of Stamford, for United States
Senator. The New Haven delegation
is also pledged to the support of Mr.
Cummings whose ' nomination un
doubtedly will be unanimous.
The other offices In the stats ticket
probably will be filled with the same
despatch that will characterize the
nominations for tho major office.' At
torney Francis P. Gullfoyle, of Wa
terbury, seems to have no opposition
for the nomination as lieutenant- 1
governor. " '
Former Senator Alton P. Miner of ,
New London, Is mentioned for comp-'

ford, may be the choice for treasurer. I
