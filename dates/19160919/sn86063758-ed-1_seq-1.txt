V SCHOOL TRUSTEES HOLD
| ISTEBESTDfG JfEETISG
r The meeting of the school trustees
in the court house on Saturday"-was
(fairly well attended. Superintendent
Swearingen was present and talked
of school conditions in Newberry
county. Prof. S. J. Derrick made an
address to the trustees, and several
of those present in answer to questions
from Mr. Swearingen told oi
conditions in their districts.
Prof. Derrick emphasized the importance
of the office of trustee and
S3id the trustees should magnify
I their office and realize tne lmponauvs
He said he believed that the school
tax should be a State tax so that we
might get rid of this little fight for
cotton mills and railroads in the districts
and that in this way every child
I
Iin the State would have the same opportunity
of every other child so far
as their school tax is concerned.
sMr. Swearingen conducted a sort of
examination as to the various high
schools and rural graded schools in
the county and asked a number of
-mi-ootiriTiR r>f the trustees present.
(<4UVOII?VMv
He said he understood from the recent
high school law that the Newberry
schools would get $700 from
this fund if they were made free to all
the children in the county and took
advantage of the terms of the new
law. Answering for the board of
trustees of the Newherry scnooi j*ir.
McSwain said that the special law
F creating the Newberry district required
the trustees to charge tuition fori
Jf all children not residents of the dls*
-t 1 from I
r trict. If the nign suuuui 1UUU v? ,
j the State was sufficient to cover the
L tuition charges it could be applied to I
| that fund. Otherwise the trustees i
k under the law would be forced to
W charge tuition for all children not ]
m residents of the district.
I Mr. C. P. Barre explained the varir
?us funds.

there is something in my make up that
j rather tickles my fancy?is that the

he is pleased to read what I write, and
*x Ay TDArO f r\ TYl^ilrp
I IT. XI d 3 IIIUU1.CU 1X1C UUVt iuutv vv UA? some
observations for the delectation
?now that's a fine vrord and sounds
good?well, I started to sxjy for the
amusement of the readers of The
Herald and News. Of course, I am
a good writer and have ideas and am
not afraid to say what 1 think, because
I have no 13xe to grind and am
not seeking any office, and if I keep in
my right mind will never seek an
"* - x 1 ??^ fVi-inl?
omce, because me pevpie uoci
of the fitness of things when they go
to vote, that Is, the fitness of the man
for the job. That is the last consideration,
if considered at all. But as
I was saying, I am a good writer and
I know it, (and I believe I could make
a success out of writing if I just
could get my consent to give my entire
time to the job. But then I never
was much of a person to make
promises. I would rather be judged
on my performances, iftit my observation
is that the people would rather
have a person on promises than on
a record of service rendered. But
all this has nothing to do with what
I want to write about. So here goes.
I have been- watching the political
game all summer in this county and in
this State with a great deal of nterest
and some amusement. It is an amusing
game. Of course, I had my pre
ferences in some of the races, and
would have been glad to have seeD
some other results, while sime of the
results please me immensely. I
learned long ago to adopt the phillosophy,
especialy in politics and in
a good many other things, that what
? 4" voot s\-r if wrvnldn't be. I
I ever IB -is ucqi< *w ......
remember to have read a little couplet
or a little verse or whatever you
I
please to call it, written by Frank
Stanton in the lAitlanta Constitution,
which runs something like this:
I
"It ain't no use to grumble and
complain,
It's just as cheap and easy to
rejoice,
If the Lord takes a notion to send
us rain,
IWhy, Rain's my choice.*'
i
1
Now, that's good philosophy, and if
the people take a notion to send me
some one that wasn't my choice, why
I am not going to grumble and complain,
because the people have a
rigkt to say what they want, and l
take it for granted that they got
what they vanted. And it all suits
me. -So let's all of us get together
and make some hog and hominy and
a little more cotton, and especially a
little more cotton seed, and in fact if
some one will just invent a cottonless
cotton with all seed at the present
i prices we can make some monsj
| growing it. I am tan optimist, tliat's
the reason I have lived to such a ripe
i old age and can go "back so far in
memory and eat so much and sleep
so well. Did you ever read that little
Doem, "The Land of Beginning
Again." Let me quote you twc
verses:
"For what had "been 'hardest we'c
know had been best,
And what bad seemed lost would b?
gain:
j For there isn't a sting that will no!
take, wine
When we've faced it and laughed ii
away:
i And I think that the laughter is moe
what we're after
In the Land of Beginning Agisin.
"So T wish that there were som<
worderful place
Called the Land of Beginning Again
| Where all our mistakes and all our'
heartaches
And all our pcor, selfish grief
Could be dropped, like a shabby old
| coat, at the door,
And never put on iagam."
I
, Let us drop our mistakes and our
, heartaches and our selfish griefs and
, laugh them away. In that land?
>
r "We would find alL the things we
intended to do
But forgot, and remembered too late,
Little praises unspoken, little
promises broken,
And all the thousand tand one
Little duties neglected that might
' i nave jfci icv^u
[! The day for one less fortunate."
L So, my friends, if things didn't go
1 to suit you, why laugh them away. If
! there is a sting anywhere let it take
! wings and fly away. That's a good
rule not only in politics but in everything
else. If some one dosen't treat
you right, so long as you have done
L your duty, that other one is the one
j who will suffer, not you. That is as
I true as the everlasting gospel, .tie
j may not let you know it, but he will
1 suffer all the same.
Now there are a lot of things that
I want to write and I am going to
write them, but I have taken up so
much space in the introduction or in
making mv bow that I must stop for
I ?
this time.

SEGRO BABY FOUND DEAD
LEGS THROUGH UPRIGHTS!
Coroner F. 1MI Lindsay was notified
that a negro baby had been found
dea-d in bed Thursday evening at a
I house on Mr. Adam Monts' place in
No. 9 township. The coroner went
to the place Friday morning and
made an investigation. Finding that
' it was clearly an accident he had no
jury in the case, as the child came to
its death by being strangled on an
iron bedstead. The one witness
' sworn was Alonzo Hiller, the father
of the child. His testimony was that
he and his wife had gone from the
house Thursday morning about an
1 hour, and had left the baby lying on
the bed. When they came back,
about sunset, his wife went to the bed
where she had left the baby and
found it dead, with its neck and
' body resting against the uprights at
' the head of the bed and its legs hang

OPENING OF
LITTLE MOUNTAIN SCHOOL
It was the pleasure of the editor to
attend the opening of the Little Mountain
high school on Monday. It was
a fine opening and an inspiration to
be there and see the school spirit that
was manifest and the enthusiasm Df
the people and of course the chilihen
and teachers. There is a fine school
spirit in this community and it has
been there for a long time and it
never tires.
This is largely' a white community
and it is a fact that \e teachers fciave
very little trouble in the matter of
discipline. And Mr. Swearingen says
it is one of the best schools in the
State and stands high.
The same teachers are in charge
this year that were there last year,
with the exception of the music teacher,
Miss Mayme Swittenberg is principal
with Misses Annie Mae Gentry,
Eunice Long, Ernestine^ Wicker,
ETberta Sease assistants. The music
department will be in charge of Miss j
Catherine Garlington and Miss Willie
Mae Wise will teach domestic science.
There wp.s an increase in the enrollment
in the high school of 25
pupils the first day. Many of them
are coming in from the adjoining district
and a.large number from Lex'-rr'UJnv.

Mr. A. k Boland, IM!r. J. B. Derrick
and Mr, W. A. Counts have always'
taken an ia biding interest in the
I c^Ti/wi and the success of the school |
is due iji large measure to their ac- j
tive work and cooperation "with, the
teachers and patrons. The people
have been loyal* to the school and in
their sup-po4rt of the teachers.

POPULAR POLICEMAN MARRIES
PRETTY GIRL BRIDE
/ ,
City Officer George H; Connelly
took his brother officers and all his
friends by surprise Sunday evening
at 7 o'clock by going to the parsonage
of Central Methodist church with
v'ola Parketon and having Rev.
F. E. Dibble perform the marriage
ceremony for him and his bride-elect.
Beth of the contracting parties are
from West End. The bride is an at
tractive young lady and the groom is i
a.-popular member of the police force
of the city, whose friends are congratulating
him on his success and wishing
for him iand his fair "bride ail the
happiness possible, "with abundant

residence of the bride's mother, Mrs.
Irene Smith, on O'Neall street.
That school bell sounded "powerful"
good yesterday morning.
There is a chance for you, reader,
to get n $150 grafanola free. All you
have to do is to go to the artistic
studio of O. and T. *2. Salter, up town,
and have some work done in their line.
For every fifty cents you spend there
you will get a chance free. You are
not out anything^ as you get the
worth of your' money, "but you are in
something, as you have a chancc to
get a fine grafianola for nothing. This
is not a raffling scheme; it is a business
transaction, and a good idea.

MORSE TALKS ON"
COMMUNITY SPIRIT
In accordance with a public announcement
the people of the town
assembled iat tfre opera house on
Monday morning together with the
children of the schools of the town
take on some enthusiasm for the betterment
of the schools. Dr. Kinard is
trying to get the people and the pa
rents at the opening of the school
year to cooperate and encourage the
children by taking an interest in the
schools. With that in view he called
a public meeting for Monday tand invited
Dr. Josiah IM'orse of the University
to come to Newberry and talk
on the community spirit. That is
what the people of Newberry need tb
Kc told jihniit. Thfiv are not verv
familiar with the subject and it "Will
take several talks to get them to understand
it thoroughly and then a
few more to get them fully aroused. |
vVell, Dr. Morse made his talk and
then Mayor Wright made a talk and
then~-"Editor Wallace maae a/ iaiK
Trustee lVIcSwain made a talk apd tall
this was preceded by prayer by Dr.
Dibble and then Dr. Kinard told what
he would like to have the people do.
It is all well and The Herald and
Maws .hnnes that the people got the
inspiration and thut the meeting
means well for the schools of the
city. We have a fine* system and
good teachers and good children and
they should have the cooperation and
encouragement of the people in the
great work they are doing f.or the
community in the education of the
children.
The total enrollment Monday in the
white schools of the city was 753 and 1
in the high school 102.
i
Dr. Kinard is an educator of large i
experience ana win Keep our s^uu^o
wel up in the front rank and he'
i
should have the sympathy and hearty
support of the entire community and :
we have no doubt but that he will'
have that support.
A Fine Address.
Dr. Geo. B. Cromer addressed a fine
congregation at the Church of the i
Redeemer Sunday night on the tem
perance question. The various other
denominations of the city united with
the Lutherans in this special service.
To say that Dr. Cromer handled his,
subject in a forceful and striking |
manner would impart no knowledge to
those who were not present to hear |
for themselves the table address, i
? i
Those fortunately present enjoyed the |
treat and -were clad of the opportunity, j
Dr. Cromer knocked the props from
under the men who argue that it is
good to take a little wine for the
stomach's sake, or the stomach's ache.
The temperance cause was greatly
