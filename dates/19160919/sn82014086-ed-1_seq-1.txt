On the Verdun Front the French Have Captured a Trench

and Russians Have Ceased Their Retreat and Definitely
Formed Their Battle Lines In Transylvania the Ru

Teutonic Allies In Macedonia the French Troops Have
Captured the Town of Fiorina, Greece, From the Bulgarians.
Along a mile front the British hae
advanced another thousand yards and
have captured a German fortified work
which bad previously resisted all their
efforts. This operation is character
ized by General Haig, the Eritish com
mander, as important and highly suc-
cessful. It is indicative of tne inten
tion of the British commander to force
the tattle along the Somme front
without cessation, the new advance
being a continuation of the powerful
movement undertaken by the British
and W-ench on Friday last.
Both north and south of the Somme
river in Franch the British and
.French troops at various points are
keeping up their vigorous offensive
against the Germans and have achiev
ed further successes and put down
stronsr German counter-attacks.
South of Combles the French have
taken additional trenches, making
stronger their investment of the little
town, which is now almost completely
surrounded. Having evacuated tlhe
village of Deniecourt, south of the
river, the Germans have been driven
back southward about two-thirds of a
mile toward Ablaincourt. South of
'Jiarleux a German trench west of
J-rorgny has been captured.
Fierce artillery fighting Is still in
progress on the sectors of the Peronne -Eapiume
road recently captured by the
French. During Punday and Monday
more than 1,600 Germans were made
prisoner by the French in the Denie
court sector.
There is considerable artillery' ac
tivity in the Champagne region. On
the Verdun front the French have
captured a trench on the southern
slope of the famous Dead Man Hill.
To stem the tide of the advance 'i
the army of the central powers in trie
Dobrudja region of Romania, the Ru
manians and. Russians have ceased
their retreat and definitely drawn their
battle lines. This extends along the

STATE WIDE PRIMARY
IN NEW YORK TODAY
Interest is Centered on How Progres
sive Vote Will be Divided.
New York, Sept. 18. Candidates for
United States senator and a complete
state ticket will be nominated at the
state-wide primary tomorrow. Chief
interest in the election apparently
centered tonight in whether the former
leaders of the progressive party will
be able to swing the votes of a ma
jority of the rank and file to Governor
Charles S. Whitman, leading republi
can candidate for governor. One wing
of the party favors the election of
Judge Samuel Seabury, whose candi
dacy for governor on the democratic
ticket is dnoipposed and who was en
dorsed by the progressives when he
was elected to the court of appeals in
1914.
National as well as state leaders of
both parties are deeply interested in
the outcome of the progressive primary
contest, for they believe it may have
an important bearing upon the out
come of the presidential campaign in
New York. It is conceded by both
sides that a majority of those who
vote for Whitman in the primaries will
support Charles E. Hughes for presi
dent while most of those who support
Seabury will vote for President Wil
son. Next to the fight for progressive
support, the most important contest to
be settled tomorrow is that between
Robert Bacon, former ambassador to
France, and William M. Calder, a for
mer congressman, for the republican
nomination for the United States sen-

OBITUARY.
Major General Albert L. Mills.
Washington, Sep, is. Major Gen
eral Albert D. Mills, chief of the bu
reau of militia affairs, holder of the
army medal of honor for braverv un
der fire, builder of the new West "Point
and former president of the army war
college, died here today after fifteen
hours' illness from pneumonia.
Apparently he was in the best of
health when he left his desk at the
war department late Saturday after
noon and so sudden was his death
that many of his fellow officers refused
stubbornly to believe first reports that
he was dead. No funeral arrange
ments had been made tonight.
In a statement issued tonight ex
pressing the sentiment of the war de
partment, Secretary Baker declared
General Mills' devotion to his work
took strength with which he might
otherwise have been able to resist the
sudden illness. The statement fol
lows: "I have a deep sense of personal loss
in the death of General Albert L,. Mills.
From the time of my coming to Wash
ington he has been more than zealous
in his self-sacrificing devotion to the
affairs of the militia bureau, of which
he was -the head and his patience, wis
dom and kindness have greatly sim
plified both my task in becoming fa
miliar with the war department and
the difficult undertaking which fell to
the department upon the call of the
militia to the Texas border.
"Plainly, the devotion of General
Mills to his work took strength with
which he might otherwise have been
able to resist the sudden illness."

GATHERING EVIDENCE AGAINST
ALLEGED BLACKMAILING BAND.
Officers Are Withholding the Details
of the Operations.
Philadelphia, Sept. 18. Agents of
the department of justice were busy
here today gathering further evidence
against the members of the alleged
blackmailing band arrested in Chicago
Saturday, and tonight served a war
rant on William Butler, alias Butts,
who, federal authorities say, is one of
the ringleader of the syndicate. Other
arrests are expected, and in the mean
time the government officers here are
wtfSjholding details of the operations
of the alleged blackmailers in the east
ern part of the country.
Butler was arrested here last Janu
ary on a charge of conspiracy and im
personating a United States marshal
in attempting to extort money from
Mrs. Susan G. S. Winpenny in order to
protect a son from prosecution for a
supposed escapade in Atlantic City.
He was heltl in heavy bail and was to
have been brought to trial at the
present term of the federal district
court. Mrs. Winpenny died several
weeks ago and in consequence the case
is held in abeyance.
On the same day Butler was arrested
Mrs. Regina Klipper, according to
Frank L. Garoarino, agent of the de
partment of justice in this 'city, went
to Cew York ith a man who turned
out later to be Frank Crocker, alias
Don Collins. She fell a victim of the
alleged blackmailers, according to Gar
barino, and was mulcted out of a large
sum of money by Frank Irwin, whose
home is said to be in Worcester, Mass.,
and another man, who is still a fugi -tsve.
They represented themselves as
government officers, Garbarino said.
Crocker was arrested in Tampa, Fla.,
last February and was taken to New
York and held in bail to await trial.
DEFEAT OF VILLA FORCES
DISCUSSED BY COMMISSION
May Hasten Settlement Between
Mexico and the United Sttaesv
New London, Conn., Sept. 18. Vil
huahua, Mexico, and the repulse of his
la's night attack on the city of Chl
forces by General Jacinto Trevino will
tend to clarify relations between Mex
ico and the United States, in the
opinion of the Mexican representa
tives on the joint commission in ses
sion here to formulate an acceptable
programme for maintaining order
along iho international boundary. The
-Chihuahua battle in which the Villa
forces suffered, heavy looses figured
prominently in the discussions of the
commission today.
The Mexican commissioners point
el cut that if Villa had been locat
ed by the action at Chihuahua, the
tasl-. of running him down would be
greatly pimplilicd. They suggested
that if General Pershing's force now
in Mexico should be withdrawn a
Mexican force would take its place
and thus prevent Villa from raiding
ot the northward. General Trevino,
In the opinion of the commissioners,
will now pursue v ilia relentlessly.
The difficulty never had been to fight
Villa, they said, but to find him.
KENTUCKY FEUDIST KILLED
BY UNITED STATES MARSHAL.
Mose Feltner, Prominent in Breathitt
County, Was Resisting Arrest.
Lexington, Ky., Sept. IS. Word

Bristol "Tanks"
Built in Peoria
HAVE ATTRACTED WORLD WIDE
ATTENTION IN FRANCE
DESIGNED FOR FARMS
Tractor Sent to Enlgland Weigh
About 18,000 Pounds Each, Develop
120 Horse Power and Are Built of
Steel.
Washington, Sept. 18. The British
"tanks", the armed motor cars used
in recent assaults on German trench
es in northern France so successmully
as to attraT- world-wide attention,
were built for the most part in Peo
ria, 111., in the form of caterpillar
tractors designed many years .before
difficult pjoblems of modern farming,
the war began to meet some of the
difficult problems of modern farming.
Except for their armor, their machine
guns and their crews, thousands like
them are in use today in the United
Stales, in plowing, digging ditches,
and other labors less heroic than war.
1,000 Sold to British Government.
M. M. Barber, vice president of the
Holt Manufacturing company, ex
plained here today that it was ma
chines made by his company at its
Peoria plant that had hurdled Ger
man trenches, walked through for
ests and walked over shell craters in
the face of intense gunfire. "We have
sold about 1,000 caterpillar tractors to
the British government," said Mr. Ba
ker. "We have had nothing to do
with putting armor on them, or plac
ing machine guns, but some of our
men at Aldershot, England, recent
ly were notified that the British Gov
ernment intended to arm some of the
tractors find use them for work other
than the usual towing of big guns.
Germany Had Some Before the War.
"Germany had some of these trac
tors before the war began and al
though I do not understand just how it
occurred, I believe she mav have got
others since then. We have sent some
to France and some to Russia. So far
as I know, up until the recent anpear
ance of the armored cars the tractors
were used only to tow big guns. I
understand that Germanv used about
forty of them in this work before
Liege early in the war and recent
photographs show that the British
are using mm- of them now for the
same purpose."
Mr. Baker said he did not know
how many of the 1,000 tractors sent
to England had been armored and
put in service as land battleships, nor
did he know what equipment the
British war office had placed upon the
cars . to be . jxsed. " '
" Can Go Over Alm'ost Anything.
"It is said." said Mr. Baker, "that
these tractors can go over almost
anyhing or through almost anvthing.
They can stradHe a trench, go
through a swamp, roll over logs, or
climb through shell craters like a
car of Juggernaut. It. looks uncan
ny to see them crawl along the
ground, just like a huge caterpillar.
In a thick forest, if they encounter
trees they could not brush out of
their way, they could easily be used
to uproot them and clear their own
paths."
Crawls on Two Belts.
Mr. Baker said the tractors sent to
England weight about 10,000 pounds
each, develop 120 horse power and are
built of steel. The caterpillar fea
ture, he explained., is of the utmost
importance. Speaking broadly, the
tractor crawls on two belts, with cor
rugated surfaces, on either side of the
body. The corrugated surface is on
the gjund. On the inside of the belts,
on each side of the body, are two
lines of sfeel rails, making four lines
in all. These rails are in short sec
tions, jointed and operated over a
cogged mechanism which aetuallv
lays them down with their belt at
tachment as the tractor moves ahead
and picks them up again so that the
car runs on its own self-made track
continuously. The short joints in the
rails make it easy to turn to right
or left.
Trucks With Five Wheels.
The body is supported by trucks
with five wheels, something like
small railroad trucks. These wheels
never touc hthe ground, but run upon
the steel rails. In the ordinary trac
tor about seven feet of belt and rails
is on the ground at one time. Mr.
Baker said that the machine would
bridge any trench that was not wider"
than the length of track it laid on
the ground at one time. The "bow"
might hit the far side of the trench
far below the top, and the "stern"
would undoubtedly sink a little, but
the tenacity of the tractor, he declar
ed, would enable it to go ahead and
climb out.
Width of Track 24 Inches.
The width of track used on the ma
chines sent to England, Mr. Baker
said, was 24 inches. He declared that
the ground pressure is about three
pounds per square inch where a
thirty inch track is used, or less than
that of the foot of either man or
horse. He suggested that the Brit
ish authorities probably had lengthen
ed the track on the tractors used In
trench work, giving them even great
er power to surmount obstacles.
"We've been making these tractors
for the British government for a long
time," said Mr. Baker, "and have not
talked much about it. Since -their
recent use in storming trenches I
have sfcen published reports that led
me to believe the secret would come
out anyway pretty soon, so I decided
It might as well be told now."'
Although he woi.l not discuss the
matter, it was understood the United
States war department is experiment
ing with armored tractors somewhat
like those now in use on the British
battle line.
