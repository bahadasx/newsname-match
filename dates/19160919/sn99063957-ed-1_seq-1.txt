Part of Contingent Landed at Marseilles Rains Halt
Movements On Western Front-Serbians, French and
Russian Troops Menace Bulgarian Base at Monastir,
Less Than Eight Miles Away-Germans Report Repulse
of Russian Attacks
By Ed L. Keen,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
London, Sepk 19. German and French commanders
felt out the opposing ' lines with surprise attacks last
night while a heavy rainstorm impeded operations on the
great Somme battlefield. As a result sharp fighting oc
curred at points where there has been a lull for several
weeks.
. The Germans battered the Champagne front heavily
in five attacks in force. Russian troops, part of the con
tingent landed at Marseilles, stopped every assault, the
French war office announced, inflicting heavy losses on
the Teutons.
The French struck northwest of Verdun. The Ger
man war office admitted that German trenches were
penetrated on Dead Man's hill, the burial ground for
thousands of the crown prince's troops in the unsuccess
ful attempt to take Verdun from the west bank of the
Meuse.
The only activity on the Somme front occurred south
of the river where the French war office this afternoon
claimed a slight advance east
office admitted the British gains east of Ginchy and near
Combles reported by General Haig last night but an
nounced the repulse of all French attacks.-
In the Balkans the pursuit of the Bulgars who have
evacuated practically all northwestern Greece is being
held up partly by Bulgarian counter attacks and partly
by the necessity of bringing up allied artillery. Serbians,
French and Russian troops are now menacing the Bul
garian base at Monastir, now less than eight miles away.
The German war office announced fresh victories
over the Russians on the eastern front and the capture
of 2,542 more prisoners.
The German official statement reported the repulse of
Russo-Rumanian .attacks in the Carpathians, near Dorna
Vatra, with heavy losses and also the repulse of Russian
attacks southeast ot Hatzeg..

to extend the French gains in this re
gion and improve the positions against
the possibility of heavy German coun
ter attacks.
The recent fighting on the front south
of the Somme left hundreds of German
bodies lying in the open between the
opposing lines. The Bavarians defend
ed their positions with the greatest
stubbornness and at many places the
French advanced only after wiping out
whole companies of enemy soldiers.

Sacramento, Col., .Sept. 19. Governor
Hiram W. Johnson, republican nominee
for United States senntor, will abso
lutely dominate not only the republican
tttate convention, but also the progres
sive state convention, when they meet
at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
Opposition to. Governor Johnson has
been swept away over night. It is doubt
ful if a score of voices will be raised
against any motion of the administra
tion in the convention. Many Jonnsoh
adherents predict that the opponents
will dwindle to less than 12 , by 2
o 'clock.
The conventions of the five parties,
republican, progressive, democratic, pro
hibition and socialist, were to have met
at 10 o'clock this morning, but were
postponed at the last moment until 2, in
order to give additional time for party
caucuses and lininj up of delegates.
While nothing definite has been de
cided as to the chairmanship of the re
publican convention, Frank H. Benson,
of San Jose, will be chosen, it is ex-
. From early niQinicJ there were con
tinual conferences at the governor's
office. Nearly all of the lltl qualified
republican delegates arrived by noon
today.
John W. Stetson, of Alameda, and
Percy V. Long, of San Francisco, two
staunch Johnson men, win control the
state convention of progressives.
"The progressive party is to continue
in California," said Long this morning.
"A new state central committee will
be named. It is probable thut the con
vention will follow -the action of the
national progressive committee nnd en
dorse Hughes for president. I do not
know just whnt the plans are, as there
are so few delegates yet in the city."
A dark horse from southern Califor
nia is to be chosen chairman of the
democratic state convention, according
to rumor. The delegates from the south
arrived nt noon.
The democratic slate calls, it is said,
for the choosing of C. K. Cushing, of
San Francisco, for the chairmanship
of the new state central committee.
This committee will probably be re
duced in number from 200 to 200.
George S. I'utton, democratic nominee
for United States senator, arrived from
Chico this morning nnd will address
the state convention this afternoon.

Kl Faso, Texas, Sept. 19. With six
automobile loads of ammunition cap
tured from the arsenal in the attack
on Chihuahua City Saturday and with
more than a thousand reeruitB from
the Carranza ranks added to his forces,
Pancho Villa today is reported fleeing
back into the fastnesses of Santa Clara
canyon, entering it by the east mouth.
De Facto government troops from
Chihuahua have abandoned the chase of
the "fox of the Sierras" in the mean
time new troops from Monterey and
other points south are being rushed
north to take up the trail of the bandits
General Trevino, Carranz.a commander
at Chihuahua City fears to use the men
recruited from northern Mexico ngninst
Villa, as they invnrinbly desert to him
at the first opportunity.
Military men here do not under esti
mate the importance of Villa's attack
on Chihuahua City and declare that all
northern Mexico is now at the mercy
of the bandit lender. They point out
that the city is the strongest military
fortress in the north and that it was
defended by heavy artillery and a gar
rison of 7,000 men. Despite this strength
Villa, after openly boasting he would
attack the city "independence day"

released prisoners nnd withdrew carry

ma Not DiBturD Americans.
Scores of refugees from Chihuahua
City arrived in Juarez last night, bring
ing first hand accounts of the attack
and confirming monger reports that the
illistns overran the city and left it at
their leisure.
Only two civilian residents of the
city were injured and none of the few
American residents. In the early fight
ing the Villistas herded all civilians
who appeared ou the streets ihto a va
cant building nnd kept them inside
while the fighting was in progress.
All incoming refugees from the south
declare that a large number of de fncto
troops deserted and marched away with
Villa, with their arms and ammunition.
Before beginning the retreat, six auto
mobiles, commandeered by the bandits,
were hacked up to the nrscnnl and load
ed with ammunition. Four hundred Cnr-
rnnzn mutineers guarded them on the
march out.
Most of the 1.200 political prisoners
in the ienitentiary were released by the
unstus.
General Gonzules has reinforced the
Juarez garrison with men and artillery.
The Carranza officials frankly admit
their fears of an nttnek upon Juiirez by
Vina torces.
So Successful That Great
Fleets of Them May Be
Feature of War Soon
Loudon, Sept. 1. Great buttles be
tween whole fleets and land dread-
naughts may result from the introduc
tion of the new "tank" or motor car
monsters in the Somme fighting by the
British, a Times correspondent at Bri
tish headquarters suggested today.
'In one short hour," the correspon
dent wired, "the tanks did more mili
tary service and killed more Germans
in uniform than nil the Zepeplins have
ever done.
"It may be that before this war is
done, we, the 'Germans and all the ullies
alike, shall be building other monsters,
huger and each more horrible than the
last until there will be laud battles of
whole fleets of drcailnuughts and ter
restrial monsters."
Only one of the "tanks" wan. de
stroyed in the Somme fighting, it was
learned today. In the center of Bou
leaux wood, where fierce fighting oc
curred, one of the new monsters lies
with its nose in the earth between op
posing lines, forming a barricade for
both British and Germans. How it was
destroyed has not been revealed in dis
patches from the front.
AGAIN
HOLLAND GIVES NOTICE
. :
The Hague, Sept. 19. Queen
Wilhelmina struck a warlike lit
note in her speech at the open-
ing session of parliament to- 4c
day.
' She told parliament that im-
portant steps to strengthen the
Dutch forces to resist any attack
on the country's neutrality are
being taken and that the supply
of war materials and munitions
is growing. She warned bellig-
erents on both sides that Hoi--
lnnd ia prepared to resist such
an attack.
"We will fulfill the duties He
that international law imposes
upon neutrals," said the queen.
"At the same time we have
b trough- decided to defend our
independence against whomever
assails it."

That was what Mrs. Joseph Tuma
said today after she had recovered
from the shock of hearing that her hus
band had committed suicide yesterday
when a run on nis private bank bad
brought him near financial ruin.
Tuma had a loan of $00,000 out and
failure to collect it, made it impossible
for him to pay his depositors, who had
become alarmed bv the failure of sev
eral private banks. He made vain at
tempts to borrow siz.uuu to title over
the emergency.
"For years Joseph had worked as a
clerk in a bank and then 12 years ago
we started one of our own," said his
widow. "Vear in and year out we
worked hard and now it is for noth
ing, Joseph wanted so much tu leave

"And now they say Joseph has kill
ed himself. Poor Joseph, Well, the
peoplo shall be paid. And then I shall
join him. We worked together too long
to remain separated."
Skeleton Found Proves To Be
That of Missing Hotel
Clerk of Salem
The skeleton of the body found last
Friday in the underbrush of the Wil
lamette five miles north of the city is
evidently that of livin Springer, form
er night elerk of the Marion hotel, ac
cording to those who are in a position
) know.
Irvin Springer, a son of Peter Spring
er of this citv, night clerk of the Ma
rion hotel, disnppeured on the night of
Jnmutrv M, 111 1 fS, and notwithstanding
the fact that the father had done ev
arything to locate him, no word had
been received to indicate whether he
wns dead or living.

the clothing clinging to it vns round

of Lelnnd Hendricks near the banks
of tho river in Polk county whero it
had evidently been washed during the
freshet of lust February. The remnius
were taken charge of by the corouer
of Polk county tor an inquest.
Identified by Keys.
In the pockets were found a bunch of j
keys and on the suggestion that theyi
might possibly huvo been those of young
springer they were brought to tho Ma
rion hotel. One proved to bo a pass
key thut was made especially for the
locks of the Marion, unlocking the doors
into all rooms. This pass key was in
the possession of Springer when he dis
appeared. Other keys were those for
the Marion cash regiter, for the cigar
room Bnd for the storage room, all of
which were In Springer's possession
when he disappeared. All of the 10 keys
found in the clothing of the skeleton
were those in the possession of Springer
and no other person. Besides the iden
tification by the keys found in the
cleaning, Peter Springer, the father,
went to Dnllus this morning and from
an examination of the clothing, and es
pecially a tie that had been presented
to his son shortly before his disappear
ance, is convinced that the remains
are those of his son. The clothing had
retained much of its color, notwithstand
ing it had been in the wnter more than
