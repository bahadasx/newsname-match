VOTERS TO GET
REOUCED RATES
Republican State Clubs Would
Corral District Ballots.
Fifteen thousand voters in Washington
will get reduced rates home to vote this
fall if the railroads accept the plan of
the League of Republican State Clubs,
announced at a meeting of the executive
committee of the league at the Commer
ctal Club last night.
T. Lincoln Townsend, president of the
league, has taken the matter up with
the passenger managers of the roads,
and stated to the committee that he Is
i.,n.'dent the plan will be adopted.
It has been te policy of the railroads
in the past to grant reduced rates for the
accmrnodation of voters. In 1904 they
granted a one-way rate for a round trip.
In 1908 it was a fare and a half and the
same for 1912, applicable to distance over
tv miles from Washington. It is pro
posed that the reduced rate be given for
the dates: September 3. October 5, 6, 7,
1-, 13. 14, 9. 20. '1. 27, 28 and November
1. 2. 3, 4, 5. 6 and 7. All tickets will be
good to return midnight of November 12.
This arrangement will make It possible
for a voter to mak the trips one for
registration and one for voting, at the
reduced rate.

FLAINfi LOVE LflTERS
DEFEAT ALIMONY PLEA
Letters to "My Dear Sweet" from Bro

(By the Iaternstleial News Servie.)
New York, Sept. 18.-A batch of
daming love letters to "My dear
sweet." "Blue Eyes," and "Dearest
Grace" today defeated Mrs. Grace M.
Duffy's efforts to obtain alimony from
John Francis Duffy, jr. Supreme
Court Justice Giegerich declined to
award support to Mrs. Duffy.
The author of the letters was Thom
as D. Conroy, a young Wall Street
broker, who is said to be married.
It developed in court that soon after
Duffy procured the letters Conroy de
manded them, telling Duffy that he
wished Duffy would leave town. Duffy
refused to give up the letters, and
then Conroy, it was stated, met Duffy
and told him he would never give up
Mrs. Duffy and "hoped the best man
would win."
Mrs. Duffy admitted that Conroy had
written to her, but said there was
nothing wrong in the letters, as Con
roy was her "matrimonial adviser"
One letter to Mrs. Duffy read:
"My Dearest Sweet: These days
seem eternal without seting you. I
love you more than any irl has ever
been loved before. I just want to
kiss you and squeeze you-to be kind
and take care of you and keep you
fromn harm.
"I played bridge Friday afternoon
and misplayed so badly every han,
that Judge Mulqueen said he had
never seen me play so badly. The
judge said he'd diagnose my case as
love.
"I blushed because he had hit me
right. But, dear, I crave' the oppor
tunity to crush you in my arms. I
cannot live without you. I swear that
I will have you for my own dear
little wife some day, even If we both
have to jump to the other end of
the world."
