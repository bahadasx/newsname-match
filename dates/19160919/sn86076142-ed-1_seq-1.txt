French, Russian and Serbian Columns on the Way to Mohastir
Defenders Flee in Disorder
After the Fall of Fiorina
Serbians Are Victorious
(Br Aaaoelated I'reaa.)
LONDON, Sept. 19. In Macedonia
the French troops have captured
Fiorina from the Bulgarians, who are
reported to be retiring In disorder
toward MonuHtir. In the Lake Os
trovo region SerbB have gained addi
tional ground.
According to Router's Salonlkl cor
respondent, the Bulgarian, In ex
tending their line ao far south aa the
region of Lake Ostrovo with limited
forces, played a bold but dangeroua
game. Success would have coin pro
nil ned the whole entente allied line,
but lack of success was bound to
prove costly by Jeopardizing the
whole Bulgarian right.
The Bret wavering among the Bul
garian, says the dispatch, waa caused
by the unexpected pressure of the
French and Russians on their ex
treme left flank, and the Serbians,
profiting by this indecltilon, attacked
energetically on the 12th and 13th.
At flrnt the Serbian Infantry made
little Impression on the well en
trenched Bulgariana, but after a
strong bombardment with high ex
plosives the Serbians carried line
after line of trenches, compelled the
Bulgariana to abandon the whole of
their advanced position along the
Mulkanldze range.
The whole Bulgarian right wing
fell back and the entente allies ob
tained commaml of the ranges domi
nating the Fiorina plain.
An Athens dispatch to the Ex
change Telegraph company describes
the latter phases of the concentration
of the attack of Fiorina, which was
carried out with the greatest secrecy.
The contingents were divided Into
three parts in a converging movement
to connect at Fiorina. The Huaaians
started from Verrla, southwest of
Salonlkl, and proceeded by forced
marches. A French column was
directed against the same objective,
while the Serbians In the region of
Horovitz were ordered to repel the
Bulgarians from the heights in the
vicinity of Ekshisu and Hetroskou.
The Bulgarians were decimated and
fled, leaving everything behind.
The road to Monastir, the dispatch
adds, now is free and it Is safe to
predict that the entente allies will
meet with little resistance in taking
the town.

DEFENSE OF BILLINGS
IS NOV IN PROGRESS
( Br Aaaoelated Preaa.)
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 19. The
prosecution closed its case and the
defense began the Introduction of
evidence in the case against Billings,
on trial in the superior court on a
charge of murder in connection with
the preparedness bomb explosion,
which resulted in the death of ten.
Two witnesses were placed on the
stand for the prosecution before the
case clone. "Mrs. Belle Lavln, at
whose home Billings lived, and who
also was the landlady of the Mc
Namara brothers, testified she accom
panied Billings to a meeting held
prior to the parade as a protest
against the ' preparedness parade.
Frank Eggers, a Jitney driver,
testified that 'he picked up Billings
the day of the explosion. He denied
having talked about the explosion
with Billings. The trial lawyers then
turned the case to the defense. Max
well McNutt, chief counsel, recalled
James McDonald.
Billings was not the man with the
suitcase on the roof of the building
at 727 Market street during; the
parade as charged by the prosecution,
according to testimony introduced by
the defense. Al De Cassia, of Oak
land, testified he waa the man on the
roof and called down to friends. He
declared he was the man photo
graphed, not Billings. He is of
similar build.

declared "The Clalma made therein
were extravagant and nothing of the

NEW YORK, Sept. 19. Candidates
for United States senator and a com
plete state ticket will be nominated
at the state wide primary today.
Chief interest in the election ap
parently centers in whether the
former leaders, of the Progressive
party "wilt be able to swing the votes
of a majority of the rank and file to
Gov. Chas. S. Whitman, leading Re
publican candidate for governor. One
wing of the party favors the election
of Judge Samuel Seabury, whose can
didacy for Governor on the Demo
cratic ticket is unopposed.
National as well as state leaders of
both parties are deeply interested In
the outcome of the Progressive pri
mary contest, for they believe it may
have an important bearing upon the
outcome of the presidential campaign
in New York. It is conceded by both
sides that a majority of those who
vote for Gov. Whitman in the pri
maries will support Chas. E. Hughes
for president, while most of those
who support Judge Seabury will vote
for President Wilson.
The Democrats also have a contest
for the senatorial nomination, but
managers of the campaign of Wm. F.
McCombs declare they do not take
seriously the aspirations of Thos. F.
Conway, of Plattfsburg, a former
lieutenant governor.
The only opposition to Gov. Whit
man's nomination within his own
party came from former State Sena
tor Wm. S. Bennet.
BLACKM AILERS WILL

(Br Aaaoelated Preaa.)
CHICAGO, Sept. 19. Four mem-
bera of the band of blackmailers may
escape prosecution, federal officials
admitted. Mrs. Kilpper, divorcee of

pear against the prisoners. The gov
ernment officials said they are con
fident she will identify Edward Dona

the band last January, when she was

The federal authorities. It is
learned, have -been besieged by
wealthy men and women claiming1 to
have been victims who pleaded that
their names be kept out of the case.
They were given to understand, It ll
said, their names would not be re
vealed unless absolutely necessary
to obtain convictions. - A mass . of

CHIEF DANGER Oil
THE EASTERN FRONT
( Br Aaaoelated Preaa.) ' . . . -BERNE,
. Sept. 19. The Sud-
Deutche Zeitung states that the Ger
man great general staff has been
moved from the western front to the
eastern front. Since his appointment
Von Hlndenburg, the chief of staff,
has desired to leave France and Bel
gium with sufficient men to hold the
line, to devote his energies to the
east. He is credited with the belief
that on this front the first conclusive
victories must be won. Last week he
returned from France to the Eastern
front.
today, 22 per cent
of the county last year waa $200,000,
of which $55,000 went to the state.
Approximately $100,000 was devoted
to other than state and school pur
poses. Half of this sum went for
salaries and only $50,000 was left for
business purposes. This sum justifies
the Belction of the proper sort of peo
ple to spend It. We need men of the
highest standard, both as to char
acter and intelligence."
The speaker said that the time has
come for the fi:lng of a minimum
wage and for child labor legialation.
He favored the return to the direct
primary,, because it represents the
will of the people.
Judge Averlll then turned to na
tional issues. One of the points
made was that the Democratic party
had pledged itself to a single term
for the presidency. Referring to the
Democratic cry that President Wilson
has kept us out of war with Ger
many, the speaker told of the "bun
combe" in that connection, Inasmuch
aa neither the army nor navy of Ger
many could at this time inflict injury
upon the United States. Since Wil
son has been in office the United
Statea has expended $300,000,000 on
the border, with all the Incidents of
war without Its declaration. Our
present preparedness is due to popu
lar demand by people of all parties
The speaker pointed out the "bun
combe" of the system of the admin
istration in . settling the railroad
strike, something that is not settled,
only deferred until the onus will fall
upon the next administration.
At the conclusion a recess waa
taken until 2 p. m.
The convention reassembled at
p. m. with the delegates seated on
the main floor and the bleachers well
filled with spectators.
The committee on credentials found
47 entitled to seats in the convention
The report was rendered by Chair

The committee on platform and
resolutions reported, as otherwise
published in this issue.
A suggestion calling for a return
to direct primaries was unanimously
adopted. The two planks In favor of

On motion by Mr. Booth the first
plank, opposing prohibition but favor
