RECEPTION
TO ST. L
VISITORS AT WAIMEA
The reception and kindred func
tions of the officers of the Fourth
Infantry, N. G. H., to General
Johnson, Commander Houston and
officers of the training ship St.
Louis at Wahnca Friday evening
proved successful in every partic
ular. There was a big luau in a
specially constructed pavilion erect
ed opposite the hotel annex, follow
ed by a dance which kept up until
the early hours of Ihe morning.
The arrangements were made en
tirely by the officers of the third
battalion, Fourth Infantry, the
headquarters of which are at Maka-weli-Waimea,
their committees being
a's follows:
Reception Major B. D. Baldwin
and staff, Captain W. 0. Crowell
and Lieutenant D. K. Hayselden.
Entertainment Captain Richard
N. Oliver and Lieutenant Cox.
Floor Captain Crowell and Cap
tain Truscott.
THE BIG LUAU
Guests began arriving shortly be
fore G o'clock, the ladies being re
ceived at one of the beach cottages
and the gentlemen at the main
building of the hotel. At 6 the
Kauai officers proceeded in a body
to the landing where they met the
officers of the St. Louis, escorting
them to the hotel.
The pavilion was covered with
canVas, fringed wjth palm leaves,
limiting, etc., in which a splendid
t. and g. flloor had been laid for
dancing There were three long
tables lengthwise of the pavilion and
two across' the ends. The Waimea
orchestra occupied a position at one
side and the Fourth Infantry band
was stationed at the mauka end.
General Johnson, Colonel Broad
bent and stall' and Major Baldwin
and staff, together with ladies, oc-
cupied the cross table at tho makai
end. Exactly 210 people sat down
to the feast, which consisted of an
elaborate spread of the choicest Ha
waiian solids and delicacies.
OFFICERS MEETING
Immediately following the luau
the officers of tho local regiment,
together with General Johnson, ad
journed to the court house where a
business session was held. Recent
correspondence between regimental
and general headquarters was read
and discussed, and General Johnson
addressed the officers on tho present
and probable future status of the
National Guard. Most of the field,
staff and line officers were prcsnt.
In the meanwhile, at the pavilion,
the assistants to the floor, commit
tee, headed b y Sergeant Gibson,
cleared the hall of tables and chairs ;
the Fourth Regiment (Lihue) band
struck up appropriate music and
dancing began. Shortly afterward
the local officers returned from
their meeting and tho terpsichorean
features assumed full swing and
zest. At that time more than 300
people were present in the pavilion.
The regimental band was assisted in
the music by the Waimea stringed
orchestra, the two aggregations al
ternating. Light refreshments were
served throughout the evening, and
a more substantial repast was a fea
ture around 11 o'clock.
The Kauai attendance included
leading residents, from Wainiha to
Mana, and the universal verdict
was that tho affair was a grand sue
cess in every particular, reflecting
great credit upon the committees
and the National Guard. From
comments heard it is believed that
General Johnson and the officers of
the St. Louis enjoyed the evening
very much.
KNUDSEN
JOINS
E
KEKAHA SUGAR GO.
Setting court machinery in motion
ot 0 n'nlrmtr in the morninc is said
to happen once in awhile in cities, I
but an experience of the Kauai
circuit court last Friday morning
will probably pass as a rare ,one.
The fact is that at tho quiet hours
of 1:30 to 2:30 that morning type
writers were busy grinding out pa
pers and tho court was engaged in
passing upon the same,
fhe early morning session of court
was not prearranged, however, but
was the' result of a series of unto
ward circumstances. During the"day
Mr. E. A. Knudsen had excepted
to certain tactics of employees of tho
Kekaha Sugar Company, charging
that they had entered upon and
were plowing and otherwise injury
ing his land and property. More
over, the understanding appeared
to bo that they intended resuming
operations of the same sort at 4 o'
clock, or shortly thereafter, Friday
morning.
At about 6 o'clock in the even
ing Mr. Knudsen arrived in Lihue
in search of Attorney Patterson for
the purpose of getting out an in
junction that would stop tho alleged
trespass. Neither Mr. Patterson nor
Judge Dickey were at their homes,
and as they live at the same place
Mr. Knudsen made himself as com
fortable as possible and waited for
the pair. Judge and attorney show
ed up along in tho late hours above
indicated, they having spenta g ood
chunk of the night at a farewell
leception which was being given for
Mr. H. Vincent.
Court Clerk Dean was hustled out
of his home by a messenger, Attor
ney Patterson prepared the com
plaint given below, hearing was had
by Judge Dickey and the injunction
below issued. The latter was sent
to Deputy Sheriff Crowell, at Wai
mea, who served it promptly. The
complaint presented to the court at
the early morning hour was as fol
lows:
Tho plaintiffs petition this Hon
orable Court, and complain against
the defendants and for cause of ac
tion allege.
I
That the plantiffs Eric A. Knud

Kamaaina Dies
Miss Ellen Augusta Johnson, i
missionary worker for many years
died at Pearl City, Oahu, last
Thursday, aged G6. She was the
youngest daughter of Rev. Edward
Johnson and Mrs. Lois Johnson,
missionaries at Waioli, Kauai, many
years ago, at which place the de
ceased wns born. Many old-tuners
of Kauai will remember Miss John
son.
THE ST. LOUIS AT
IfflEA F
WA
RIDAY
The Hawaiian training cruiser St.
Louis, Commander Houston, having
on board General Johnson and the
officers and men of the Hawaii
naval militia, arrived at Waimea at
4 o'clock sharp Friday afternoon,
after having cruised around Kauai
and Nlihau, during which all man
ner of drill known to warships was
gone through with. Major Baldwin
and a delegation of officers of th
third battalion, Fourth infantry,
appeared on the dock, but hearing
a report that no one would land
until 6 o'clock they returned to
the hotel. A short time later, how
ever, General Johnson landed and
joined them.
The St. Louis remained off Wai
mea until 6 o, clock Saturday even
ing when she resumed her cruise
via. Honolulu to tho other islands.
The visit of the St. Louis to Kau
ai is notable for the reason that
she is the first training ship to
touch here in history.
Many of the officers and ' 'sail
ors" aboard are well known here.
One of the officers is a son of Mr.
T. II. Gibson, once a teacher on
this island, and a son of Hon. J.
H. Coney is a "sailor" on board.
In connection with the visit of
the St. Louis to Waimea with sail-ors-in-thc-making
on board it may
be interesting to know that that
town supplied Uncle Sam with a
sailor (a Kauai prince) about the
year 1800. Bingham's history gives
the following account of it, in effect:
George P. Kaumualii, in his
childhood, had been sent by his
father (King Kaumualii) to Amcr
ica, partly from apprehensions of
danger to the child from jealous or
aspiring relatives. He was supplied
with means of support when he left
Waimea, Kauai; but Capt. R, who
took chargo of him, lost both his
own property and that of his ward.
George labored as a carpenter's ap
prentice for several years, then in
the service of a farmer; hut feeling
homeless, or restless, or disposed
for the scenes of war, he. enlisted in
the United States Navy. He was
in the engagemeut between the En
terprise and Boxer, and, in the act
of boarding, was wounded in the
side by a British pike. He after
wards went up tho Mediterranean
as one of the crew of the Guerriere,
under Com. Decatur, and was in an
engagement with an Algerine fri
gate. Thon returning to Charles
town he was able to accompany the
first missionaries back to his native
land.
To Play Army
Senator Clias. A. Rice arrived
from Honolulu this morning but
will go back again tonight, as the
polo game between the Kauai and
Army teams is yet to be played
In a practice tilt with the Army
team yesterday thu Kauai team got
much the best of it.
ENTERTAIN IN CITY
Last Sunday's Advertiser (Hono
lulu) said:
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Rice enter
tameu uengnuuiiy at dinner on
Tuesday evening at the Country
Club for Mr. and Mrs. Jay Gould,

a large oval one and prettily dec
orated w i t h variegated African

through tho dinner and for the danc
ing which followed.
JAPANESE
CONSUL
AT
W
KAMA
Would Bring About Better Un
derstanding Between
Races Here
Since his arrival last Wednesday,
Japanese Consul Mori has been a
very busy man on Kauai. Hq has
not only visited all the centers of
Japanese population, but has de
livered numerous lectures to Japa
nese, in which he lias urged them
to develop those qualities that assist
good citizenship and government,
and to endeavor to promote friendli
ness between the various races here
Last night at Rev. J. M. Lyd
gate's residence tho Consul spoke to
English-speaking people. The fol
lowing is a verbatim report of what
he said, except for a change here
and there where it was quite evi
dent that the Consul had used a
word different from the one in
tended :
Since my coining here this spring
as Consul General, I have taken ad
vantage of every opportunity pre
scnted to me to meet American peo
ple, and have always striven to ex
plain and better the friendly rela
tionship between America a n d
Japan. In common with many of
you, leading Americans and Japa
nese, I firmly believe that Hawaii
is the only place on the globe where
Americans and Japanese are living
most harmoniously, the place where
their relationship is almost attaining
its-ideal.- But this belief can only
be had, when Hawaii is compared
with other places. We can not say
with absolute confidence that Ha
waii is the true ideal. As I have
just recently said, in one of the
meeting of the Citizenship dnnpaign
in Honoluln, Americans and Japa
nese have come to and are under
standing each other only in the ex
ternal and not in the internal sense.
The reason for this is twofold. First,
Japanese have failed to grasp the
American spirit and thought at its
best. Secondly,the Americans them
selves do not understand the Japa
nese spirit and thought at its best.
For this reason, I will tako this

inspection of the ship and finally a
dance, all of which tho visitors en
joyed very much,

Sugai ."5.52
Honolulu Only Japanese, who do not belong to unions, have refus
ed to join tho strike of stevedores. The local union was formed some
time ago secretly, and is connected up with unions at tho coast. Coast
stevedores can make it unpleasant for local shippers if advised by the
union here that conditions arc unfair.
The Chamber of Commerce has decided to approve the idea of an
immense photo-play, illustrating Honolulu life.
Hawaii-born Japanese take a Japanese editor to task for saying in
his paper that their position here was worthless and hopeless. Resolu
tions were adopted setting forth the position of Hawaii-bom Japanese,
and the session to organize an American association was turned into an
indignation meeting
German Retirement

and Sir Douglas Haig issues a statement in which ho says that opera

Naniur and Mezicres to consolidate their forces.

BASEBAL
flES
LGAI
AT LIE SUNDAY
Quite a crowd witnessed the two
games of baseball in the National
Guard series which were played off
in Lihue park Sunday afternoon.
A large part of the audience was
made up of laborers not enough of
the customary fans being present.
The iir-t game was between the
Hospital Corps and First Battalion,
resulting in the disastrous rout of
the latter, the score being 10 to 1
after tho aggressors had given the
"doughboys" an inning or two and
tried their best, to make them score.
The pill-mixers were plainly far too
strong for the homers.
THE SI-XOND GAME.
Tho second game started imme
diately after the first, tho contest,
being between the third and second
battalion. In this game the score
also ran high, and was onesided,
but that was due principally to hea
vy batting. Although a better arti
cle of ball was probably put up in
tho first game, a great deal of fun
resulted from the second contest.
There will be n o games next
Sunday. Before Sunday week it is
hoped that the new schedule will
be shaped out.
