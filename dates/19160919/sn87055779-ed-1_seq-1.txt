Frantic efforts wert' made to dis

out from republican headquarters
offering the film for production.
Tuesday's World story in par', is as
follows:
"Having censored the moving pic

J lis statements were to the effect
that it was preposterous to say that
anything indecent would be pro
duced, anil while he refused to give
any details whatever of the picture,
he had viewed earlier in the day, he
inferred that if it did contain the
st cues spoken of in the World the

Internntlmnil New Service:
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19. Facing
apparent defeat In diplomatic efforts
to secure relief from the trade re
strictions imposed on American
commerce by the entente allies, the
Fnited States today has available
complete data preliminary to the en
forcement of retaliatory measures.
While retaliation will not be re
sorted to until all diplomatic meas
ures have failed, the state depart
ment has made practically complete
arrangements Tor the enforcement
of an embargo on both importations
and exportations, should it become
necessary.
The retaliatory measures will bo
taken tinder the recently enacted
revenue law which gives Pres't Wil
son authority to:
Prohibit the importations of any
or all goods from countries which
discriminate against American com
merce. Tan Deny Clearances.
I)eny clearance from American
ports to any or all vessels which re
fuse to accept American goods for
shipment for anv reason other than
lack of cargo space.
Fnder the direction of the state
department the department of com
merce and the treasury department
now have collected the data on
which proclamations enforcing both
retaliatory proposals can be used.
Complete records of discriminations
against American commerce both in
the matter of shipping, under the
so-called blacklist and in the matter
of destination, under the restrictions
imposed on Scandinavian and Dutch
trade, have been complied. The state
department will have available a
statement of the exact effect of these
restrictions on American trade, both
in bulk and in detail.
Forwards Complaints.
The department of commerce to
day forwarded to the state depart
ment a selected list of complaints of
American merchants .rmd manufac
turers who have suffered under the
restrictions on trade with northern
Furope. These complaints were
culled out of the flood of protests
coming from American snippers as
special cases of discrimination and
injury.
A statement shewing the general
jefiect of the allied restrictions on
! northern Furopean trade, compiled
I by the department of commerce
shows that in the seven months
ended with July. American exports
to Holland. I'entrark and Sweden
fell off JJ4.153,4:i3 from the same
period in lUlä. The exports of Hol
land suffered most, dropping $40,
.yt.7sr. Swedish trade lost $3 4,
i;::..1..) and Danish $1$,759,37C.
Norway, the only northern Furopean
country to show a gain for the period
received increased trade of about
J 7. IHM, (I I).
These figures, with detailed state
ments of the effects of the restric
tions on individual cases, will be used
as a basis for the operation of the
retaliatory measures, if it is decided
to make these measures effective.

thus swelling the ranks of employes
enpaged In a bitter struggle with
traction mangrnates decided Impetus
was piven to peace efforts. These
are lelnff made by Mayor Mitchel

The. mayor awaited only written
proposals from the labor leaders,
statine: the conditions on which they
would call off the strike to" confer
with Chairman Straus and then take
up the situation with committees
representing the chamber of com
merce and the merchants associa
tion. These civic bodies are anx
ious to see the strike ended.
Mayor Mitchel said that he and
Mr. Straus would ask the advice and
assistance of the committees in an
endeavor to adjust the present dif
ficulties and prevent the sympathetic
strike which the labor leaders have
declared will be called if the pres
ent trouble is not settled by 2
o'clock Friday afternoon.
"l.eyond this I can say nothing,"
declared the mayor.
"It was regarded as significant to
day that Police Commissioner Woods
was continuing to make preparations
to meet any emergency which might
result from a spread of the strike.
That an effort will be made to call
out all of the 800. 000 men and
women union workers in the greater

about an amicable adjustment has
been frankly stated to the mayor by

CHICAGO,. Sept. 19. Two distinct
hunts for another blackmailers' ren
dezvous were on in Chicago today.
Satlsed that the fashionable apart
ment which ylieded seven arrests
Saturday was merely a "blind" both
federal operatives and city detectives
searched for a place from which it
is believed the members of the "syn
dicate" conducted their real work.
This place, otlicials believe, is on
the south side.
Suspicions that the blackmailers
have another headquarters in Chi
cago were aroused when a close
search of the Grand boulevard
apartment failed to reveil the two
strongest weapons of the swindlers
their fake secret serxice badges
and their fake warrants. It was
through these "ollicial" mediums
that the victl.n was usually presuad-
ed to "come across" when trapped
with some one of the opposite sex in
a compromising position.
Women Due Today.
Mrs. Regina KJipper of Philadel
phia, one of the many victims of the
trust, was expected here today to aid
in the identification of those already
under arrest, and to corroborate the
story told by Frank Crocker, a for
mer member of the band. It was
Crocker's disclosures that led to the
arrest of his former associates.

the real thing drive against those
citizens of the United States who
earn in excess of $3,000 annually,
is being planned. The object, Com
misisoner of Internal Revenue W. 11.
Osborne frankly states, is to in
crease the revenue of the govern
ment by one-third the amount at
present coming in under the income
tax law. In order to devise the best
way of collecting all of the tax the
commissioner today sent word to ."0
of the mo:t experienced agents and
collectors to report here on Oct. 1.
They then will discuss ways and
means of ascertaining all persons
liable to the tax, so that it can bo
collected. In this collection it i
said by treasury officials that they
are convir.ced that several millions
of dollars have not been turned in
simply betause of ignorance of the
law by persons liable to the tax. It
is to remedy this condition that the
department is now planning.
It is the desire of the administra
tion to stave off issuance of bonds
to defray :he extraordinary expend
itures resulting from the elaborate
national defense program as long aw
possible. But in order to do this it
has become necessary to institute a
general enforcement of taxation laws
.11 along the line. Not alone the in
come tax law, but the corporation
tax reiui-ement and all similar
formed levies are to be rigidly en
forced. The expectation of the department
that it wi I he possible to deie a
program that cannot be eaded by
tax doP-'es at the eoming confer
ence. The methods of collecting in
formation regarding Incomes "at the
toure" will be radically changed, it
i:- expected and made more fruitful
for the government agents.
