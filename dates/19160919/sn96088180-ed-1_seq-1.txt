"In one hort hour," the corre

f
Washington, Sept. 19. Twenty
seven caterpillar tractor, similar to
those converted . Into "land dread
naught tank" by the British in
northern Prance, will oon bo a part
of tho U. 6. army's equipment. The
same Peoria, 111., firm whloh sup
plied the British with tho engines for
the armored fighting monitor ha
contracted to build the hugh tractors
for this government. They, are to be
delivered within ninety days.
The tractors will weigh between
11,000 and 14,000 pounds. This Is
'considerably below the weight of the
tractor furnished for Engtand. Their
price will be 14,755 etch. It will
jcoet 11,000 additional for encasing
'them In armor.
Colonel Rice, of the ordnance de
jpartment, explained today that while
these tractors coiilo easily be turned
Into land dreadnaughte similar to
the British tanks, It Is unlikely this
will be dono.
"Conditions here would not call for
such engirt of war." Rice ssld. "In
fho flnt nine It lit not likelr that
'war In America would develop Into
trench warfare, because of the enorm
ous distances, except where It wonld
be confined to local territories."
Tho tractors 'bought for the U. 8.
army are to be used to haul big guns.
They will bo armored and probably
will carry rapid firing rifles, but more
for defense than offense. They are
much similar to the ordinary farm
tractors, except thst they are more
powerfully constructed.

The threatened rift In the Mexican-
American conference appeared today
to have been closed, at least tempor
arily.
The American commission has con
sented to five Immediate considera
tion to the withdrawal ot troops and
to arranging for border protection.
In this matter, the Mexicans have
pledged to send a force to replace
Pershing's men.
On the whole, the Americans feel
that there is no actual break' ahead.
But the Mexican temper Is such,
manifestly, that the border patrol and
withdrawal questions must be decided
definitely, and at once, else there will
be trouble ahead for the commission.
The Mexicans have pledged them
selves to hunt Villa to the "bitter
end." The attack on Chihuahua sim
plifies the problem, they say. Hither
to it ha been a problem ot locating
the bandit leader rather thai) fight
ing him, and now they foelieve he has
revealed his whereabouts. ; .
One big problem, upon which the
world in general -must pass, Is the
subject ot the Mexicandeclaration ot
"equal rights" to Mexicans and for
eigners in Mexico. The Mexicans say
Mexico wlli be more peaceful by rea
son of becoming "less subject to out-
sifie contentions," 'hence, Carranxa
will put both Mexican and foreign in
terests "on the same footing."

two places and are advancing against
the Bulgarian base at Monastlr. Ser
bian soldiers are fighting on their na
tive soil for the first time since their
retreat through Albania last winter.
They have captured a series ot
heights from the Bulgars at Kamak
cbalan, and have crossed tbe Serbo
Greek border north ot Lake Ostrovo.
French and Russian troops are en
gaged with the Bulgars near Kenale,
on Serbian territory. Practically all
the territory conquered by the Bul

sion of Greece' has already been re
captured by, the Serbs, French and

The most savage fighting has oc
curred where Serbs and Bulgarians
came In contact. Eager for revenge,
the Serbs are flinging themselves at
the Bulgarian' lines with knives and. t
bayonets. Despeiate hand-to-hand
fighting was reported northwest of
Lake Ostrovo. ". ; ' ;
The Bulgars have made almost no
