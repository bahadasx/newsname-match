(Associated Press)
Tallahassee, Sept. 19. J. C. Bar
ton wa,s arrested last night charged
with perjury as a result of his testi
mony yesterday before the supreme
court in the Catts-Knott gubernator
ial primary contest. Barton had tes
tified that he saw W. S. Morrow, au
ditor of county finances and M. T.
Hunter, clerk of the circuit court of
Hamilton county, in the courthouse at
Jasper on June 17th with the ballot
boxes and ballots. He said he believ
ed they were changing the vote of the
democratic primary of June 6th. Bar
ton gave bond in the sum of $500.
Barton's Story
Tallahassee, Sept. 19. Six wit-
nesses were examined yesterday in
the matter of the case against the
state canvassing board to show cause
why it should not recanvass the votes
for governor.
The morning was given over to the
question ofxwhether the ballot boxes
had been tampered with in Madison
county. The witnesses from Suwa-
nee and Hamilton counties '" had not
been called but are here with the
boxes from their counties and are
ready to take the stand " whenever
called upon.
The proceedings are very slow and
the examination of witnesses may last
for several days yet. There were no
sensations during the morning ses
sion. The ; witness who is expected
to testify that he saw the ballot boxes
tampered with has not yet been called
on.
Yesterday afternoon, M. N. Bryan,
election manager at Hamburg, pre
cinct No. 6, of Madison county, swore
that he called the ballots at the first
count on the night of election day and
that afterwards the were stuffed
away promiscuously in the ballot box.
Upon the box being opened for the
recount he swore that the ballots had
been laid out in regular order and
neatly arranged in place of being
stuffed into the box as he had left
them. This is the best evidence that
the ballots had been tampered with
that has so far been introduced, it is
claimed.
The supreme court is now going
through the preliminary stages to al
low counsel for the canvassing board
to show that there had been a physi
cal change in the ballots by the exam
ination of witnesses without going
into the boxes. If probability of this
can be shown the boxes will be open
ed. If not the court will not allow the
boxes to be opened.
BERLIN PREDICTS RUTHLESS
SUBMARINE BLOCKADE
London, Sept. 19. In a dispatci
from Berlin to the Daily News Rut
ledge Rutherford says:
"Germany has decided to declare a
blockade against England, effective on
January first next.
"For this purpose a powerful fleet
of submarines is being completed and
plans are being worked out 'to make
the blockade" a stringent one.
"The movements of the submarines,
it is said, will be guided to some ex
tent by Germany's high flying Zep
pelins.
"These submarines and Zeppelins
will be equipped with extra sensitive
wireless apparatus.
"One high in the counsels of the
German naval administration today
said: v -
. " 'By the end of the year and per
haps a little sooner Germany will
have in fighting trim three hundred
submarines of the most efficient type,
and no vessel carrying food or muni
tions will be permitted to reach Eng
land. Ours will be a real blockade,
not a coercive or illegitimate one,
such as England pretended to insti
tute, against Germany.
"'No compunction wilj be felt re
garding the revival of submarine
warfare, because it is felt that Eng
land's abrogation of the Declaration
of London has left Germany free of
restraint in the matter of her promise
to America
"Walter Forstmann, Germany's
most skilled ' submarinist, is on pro
gram to command the squadron of
submarines. He recently received the
Order of Merit for sinking more than
a hundred vessels, which included
transports, patrol vessels and mer
chantmen.
"The return" ' of the submarine
Deutschland from the United States
has encouraged further undersea ef
forts. . Many new submarines will be
equipped with improved devices, one
of which will enable submarine com
manders to detect and deStroy nets
which England has laid, and will lay,
in great numbers."

AGAIN CAUGHT CATTS
WITH THE GOODS ON
(Palatka Times-Herald)
That old saying about "the trouble!
with the liar is that once he gets the
habit he will tell 'em even if he knows
he will get caught up with," surely
must have been intended for Rev.
Catts,' who "tells 'em" by the whole
sale.
Now, take that speech Rev. Catts
delivered here and that was made
after friends had ordered the . "soft
pedal put on" and the anarchy spiel
cut out. From beginning to end it
was a mass of misstatements. In our
report we took the liberty to show the
absolute untruthfulness of some of
his wild utterances, and the absurdity
of several of his statements.
One of the richest things, however,
was the harrowing picture the hero
painted of Florida in the event of Mr.
Knott's election. Mr. Knott who is a
consistent member of the Baptist
church and a man whose public and
private character is of the purest
order, is transformed by Catts into a
tyrannical monster who would put
Florida in chains at the bidding of the
Roman hierarchy whatever that' is.
Then Rev. Catts cites Pensacola as an
example of what we might , expect
along this line. In his Palatka speech
be' said that Pensacola had a special
aw, passed by the Catholics, prohibit
ing the offering of a prayer or the
singing of a hymn in the public
schools the penalty for violating the
act being a fine of $25.
In telling this yarn Hero Catts was
extremely dramatical. He pathetical
ly told how a young lady teacher,
beautiful and pious, might not only
want to open school with prayer, but
with singing a hymn. He quoted a
few favorite lines from those touch
ing, soul-inspiring .songs, "Nearer My
God to Thee," "Rock of Ages," and
others, and then tearfully told of the
dire consequences that would follow
such a heinous infraction of the law
( ?) in that city.
Now, Rev. Catts probably thought
that as he was several hundred miles
from Pensacola, he could tell this pa
thetic story and " get away with it.
Doubtless many of the more gullible
ones swallowed it, but some who had
heard of Sidney J.'s fondness of the
untruth were a bit doubtful, though
they, too, were deeply touched by the
heart-rending story. A prominent
citizen a sort of "doubting Thomas"
oit this CattS stuff wrote to Pensa
cola to ascertain whether the Rev.
Catts jsvas only joking or merely pre
varicating. This is the .reply he re
ceived from Hon. John B. Jones, who,
as city attorney, and a life-long resi
dent of Pensacola, should know the
laws of his town if anyone does:
Dear Sir: I duly received your let
ter of the 6th inst., stating that the
"Honorable" Sidney Jr Catts, candi
date for governor, in a speech in Pa
latka a few nights since, told his audi
tors that the offering of a prayer or
the singing of a hymn or any devo
tional exercise at all . in the public
schools of Pensacola was punishable
with a fine of $25, and requesting me
to advise you "whether or not Mr.
Catts is right in his statement, or
slightly misinformed."
The city of Pensacola has no such
ordinance, and has never attempted to
impose any such penalty, or to inter
fere with the affairs of the public
schools in such manner as Mr. Catts
is alleged to have stated.
Yours very truly,
John E. Jcnes, City Attorney.

CAMPAIGN PLANS
Fairly Good Crops and Better Trans
portation Obviates All Dan
ger of Famine
(Associated Press)
Mexico City, Sept. 19. The produc
tion of food-stuffs in Mexico for the
current year has obviated any chance
of shortage, according to the depart
ment of agriculture. The crops are
said to be not only sufficient to pre
vent famine but will make Mexico
practically independent of importa
tion of food-stuffs from other coun
tries, although a certain amount of
corn and flour wnll continue to be
imported into the northern states
from the United Slates because of
superior facilities for transportation
to those localities.
The crops, it is admitted, will not
reach normal production but will He
sufficient to allow a certain amount
of exportation. The question of food
supply is one of distribution rather
than production, and it will be neces
sary to transport to the more barren
states products from those localities
where normal or nearly normal crops
prevail. - It is pointed out that while
some undoubtedly died of starvation
in the capital last year, thi3 was due
not to shortage of food bub-to the im
possibility of adequately transporting
what was available.
Within the last few months, accord
ing to the department officials, means
of transportation have increased
many fold. Regular train service has
been resumed not only with the Unit
ed States border but between interior
points and railroads which have been
idle for an extended period have re
sumed operation.
The corn crop, the great Mexican
food staple, will be good, in all por
tions of the republic except Zacate
cas, Chihuahua and San Luis Potosi.
In each of those states disturbed con
ditions have not only prevented plant
ing1 but have left the farmers with an
inadequate supply of seed corn. In
the other states the corn crop has
been excellent. The agricultural de
partment also expects to add to the
available supply a large amount of
old corn hitherto held for large price
advances.

Field Secretary A. H. Cole predicts
an attendance of 500 or 600. Wesley
Bible Class men and women at the
big federation in Ocala October 10.12.

body and each class or individ
ual will ; provide for the expense of
the trip. Ocala hotels will give low
rates for the two days. A fine pro
gram has been arranged, and a good
time is expected. Those who are pro
moting the federation are leaving
nothing undone to make it a great
success. Ocala is making preparation
for giving these Sunday school forces
a cordial welconie. The Sunday school
workers, especially those belonging to
organized Bible classes, who do not
include the federation in their plans,
will miss the most helpful event of
the year.

Best Teachers Available Have Been
Secured and Outlook for a Suc
cessful Term is Bright
The Ocala schools will open Mon
day, Sept. 25th. For the Ocala grad
ed and high school the following fac
ulty has been chosen: Fourth grade,
Misses Eugenia Fuller and Helen
Vaughn; fourth and fifth, Miss An
nie Pope Eagleton; fifth grade, Mrs.
Rex Todd and Mrs. H. S. Wesson;
sixth grade, Miss Marion Dewey and
Mr. Robert Connor; seventh grade
Misses Minnie Lee Carlisle and Ruth
Abel; eighth grade, Miss Elizabeth
Mizelle. High school, Miss T. B.
Abernathy, assistant principal, Latin
and French; Miss Miriam "Pasteur,
English; Mr. R. C. Keith, science;
Miss Lulu Doke, mathematics and
history; Miss Lucile Cooper, home
economics; Miss Pauline Magness,
music; Mrs. Allie Van Davis, expres
sion. . There were nine vacancies made In
last year's faculty by resignation and
otherwise. In filling these an earnest
and persistent effort has been made
to secure the best teachers obtainable
for the salaries which the positions
pay. Irreproachable character, splen
did preparation and in most in
stances, successful experience have
been demanded as qualifications for
these places. The two who have had
but Jittle experience have had train
ing which offsets that lack. A few
words by way of introducing the new
members of the faculty might be of
interest to the public. Miss Helen
Vaughn of Thomasville, Ga., is a
graduate of a leading high school of
Colorado, attended Kansas University
one year, and completed last June a
two-year course for teachers in the
Florida State College for Women. As
to character, personality and ability,
Miss Vaughn has the unqualified en
dorsement of the faculty of the last
named institution. Miss Eagleton be
ing well known in Ocala and being a
prominent graduate of the Ocala high
school of the class of 1914, needs no
introduction. She also completed with
dredit the two years' course for teach
ers at the Florida State College for
Women, receiving with Miss Vaughn
her teacher's graduate state certifi
cate. Miss Eagleton is also . highly
recommended by the faculty of the
Woman's College. Miss Marion Dew
ey, another, popular and well known
Ocala girl, a graduate of the Ocala
high school in the class of 1913, has
since spent one year in college and
two summers at the university sum
mer school, Gainesville. She taught
last year at Courtney on the East
Coast and was asked to accept her
position for another term. Miss Ruth
Abel lives at Terra Ceia. She is a
graduate of the Manatee county high
school and has taught in the gram
mar department of that institution
for four years with splendid success,
and to the entire satisfaction of pa
trons and school officials. She has
taken .special work at the Florida
Woman's College. The school is es
pecially fortunate in securing Miss
Miriam Pasteur, an Ocala lady, as
teacher of English. For years the
writer has known of her superior
ability as a teacher and has often"
been told by the state high school in
spector that she had few equals In
the state. Miss Pasteur comes to us
from Fort Myers, where special in
ducements were offered to get her to
remain in the faculty of that school.
Miss Doke is a graduate of the Fort
Meade high school, has attended the
Florida Woman's College two sum.
mers and holds a state certificate. She
has taught very successfully in her
home county for six years, four of
which have been in the Fort Meade
school. She is highly recommended
by the school officials of that county
and town and was re-elected to her
former position with an increase of
salary. Mr. R. C. Keith is a graduate
of Columbia College, has taken work
at the summer schools, holds several
special certificates and has taken
most of the. examinations for state
certificate. He has been very suc
cessful as principal of junior high
schools and was this year elected to
the principalship of one of the best
junior high schools of West Florida.
Parties in Marion county who were in
school with' Mr. Keith say that Ocala
is fortunate in securing him. Mr.
Keith can be of assistance in direct
ing the athletics of the boys but is not
prepared to give the military drill.
This the principal very much regrets
Every possible effort was made to
secure a young man who was well
qualified as a teacher of science and
at the same time was specially pre
pared to direct the athletics and give
the military drill. Early in the va
cation, young men were found who
were well qualified for the position
and who were anxious to come to
Ocala but could not afford to come
for the salary offered. At three dif-
Prohibition to be Voted on in Next
General Election, Says Kent
Pendleton
(Associated Press)
Jacksonville, Sept. 19. Kent Pen
dleton, superintendent of f'the Florida
Anti-Saloon League, in a statement
made today claimed the submission of
the prohibition question to Florida
voters in 1918 was assured.- He de
clared , that twenty-four state sena
tors out of thirty-two, and more than
sixty of the seventy-five house mem
bers had pledged themselves in writ
ing to vote for the submission of the
resolution. .
ferent times it was thought a satis
factory young man had been secured,
but each time because of misunder
standing or unavoidable delays, t the
said young men accepted other posi
tions. It was not until about ten days
ago that the search was given up and
a young man was selected who was
known to be a good teacher but -whose
qualifications for directing athletics
and the military drill were not known.
It was a matter of disappointment
and regret to all who knew Miss Gro
man or who had heard of her ex
cellent work as teacher of home eco
nomics when it was announced that
she' would not return on account of
the salary. While it was very diffi
cult to find a teacher who could in
every way fill Miss Groman's place,
it is believed that task has been ac
complished. Some years ago the
president of Whitworth College wrote
to the United States commission of
education to know the best southern
college to which to send his daughter
for the most thorough course in home
economics. Dr. Claxton recommended
the Florida State College for Women.
To that Miss Lucile Cooper went and
spent five years, taking the B. S. and
M. S. degrees and majoring- in home
economics. During the last two years
she taught home economics in the
college. Miss Harris m authority for
the statement that Miss Cooper is in
all respects oYte of the. best qualified "
teachers of home economics ever
turned out by the Woman's College.
It is also a matter of general regret
that Miss Mary Lee Hill decided to
sever her connection with the school,
but the school is fortunate in secur
ing as her successor Mrs. Allie Van
Davis, a lady of splendid preparation
and very successful experience. Mrs.
Davis taught in the schools of Car- i
rolton, Ga., last year. Her work there
is most highly commended by all the
school officials. It is hoped that the
expression department will receive
the patronage which the preparation
and experience of Mrs. Davis merit.
The trustees recommended that a
department of music be added this
term, music being a part of the
course of every progressive public
school system. The addition of this
department entails no extra expense,
except for the securing of a piano.
The director will give instruction in
public school music in each of the
grades below the high school, will
train a chorus class and will conduct
all musical exercises of the school.
For this she will be provided with a
piano and a room in which to teach
and will receive for her remuneration
the tuition of her piano pupils. Miss :
Pauline Magness of Nashville, Tenn.,
has been selected as director of muic.
In preparation for the teaching of
piano she has had an extended course
under teachers of the , New England
and Leipsic conservatories. For the
teaching of public school music, Miss
Magness took her training in Tulane
University and George Peabody Col
lege. She has had several years very
successful experience as a teacher of
music in the public schools and col
leges of Mississippi and Tennessee. It
is hoped that this department will re
ceive such support"1 as will make It
self-supporting and warrant its con
tinuance. . Another article will give the pro
gram of the opening exercises and the
work of the first day.
