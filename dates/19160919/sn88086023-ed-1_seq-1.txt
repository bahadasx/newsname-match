WASHINGTON, D. C Bept
Tha fight 1 on once more between

ple, that believes ill government of
the people, by the people for the peu
ple and the party of privilege, that
believes In the government of the peo
pla by the bosses for the benefit main

mocracy In represented by 1'resldent
Wilson with the rich trull of bia

of privilege Is represented by uu un

questions of the day, on which he has
been strangely silent or slbyline
backed by the bosses of the republi
can party, ranging all the way from
cldlvant progressives to the most
stundpat of reactionaries, but whoa
one common Interest is their devotion
to the perpetuation of privilege. Mr
Hughaa says that he stands firmly oa
their platform and we know what that
plauorm is the destruction of de
mocracy with, its unequalled accom
plishment. As they put forth no

IS TO END FUSS
Pendleton, Ore., Sept. 19, 1911.
Killlor East Oregonlaii:
In order that the action of the
County Court and of the Board of
Managers of the Commercial Associ
ation respecting the library contro
versy may not be misunderstood by
the public, I desire to say to the peo
plo of Umatilla county, through the
columns of the press, that the County
Court and the Board of Managers of
the Commercial Association of the
City of Pendleton are not taking sides
with anybody In nny of the quarrels
and disputes that have been going on.
The purpose Is to end the unpleasant
controversy without any more hys
teria from any source. The Board of
Managers has merely asserted Its
ownership to property that was be
ing wrangled over by other persons.
The action taken will enable the
courts to define nnd make clear the
ownership of a large part of the li
brary that Is now located In the
Umatilla county building, and no
doubt In the long run will ennhle the
courts to define the duties and re
sponsibilities of atl persons In any
way connected with library affairs.

Board of Managers Empowers Special Committee to
Take Charge of Books of Association Now Held
by Pendleton Public Library and Put Them in

CIVIC CLUB ALSO MEETS AND TAKES SIMILAR STEPS
As a step toward putting the library j
controversy into the courts for detl-
nite settlement, the board of mana-
gers of the Commercial association
yesterday afternoon by resolution em
powered a special committee to take
charge of thu books of the associa

In the county library building.
The Commercial association is lay
ing claim not only to the books held
by the association at the time of the
turnover to the city, but also to all
books purchased from the Income of
the Sturgls fund.
It is about this point that the pros
pective legal fisht will be made. Judge
Fee. trustee of the fund, takes the
position that the Commercial associa
tion never did own the library' known
as the "Commercial Association Li
brary'." that said library was original
ly christened the "Pendleton Public
Library" and was managed by an or
ganization separate and distinct from
the Commercial association. Though
the will of Samuel P. Sturgls left the
trust fund for the Benefit of the
"Commercial Association Ulbrary,"
Judge Fee contents that the termi
nology was a mistake ot the attorney
who drew the will for the reason that
Mr. Sturgls knew that there was no
such library by that name.
Civic club Takes Action.
The Civic club met last evening al
so and by unanimous vote decided to
take the books owned by the organi
zation from the control of the city li
brary board and turn them over to
the county library.
In the meantime none of tha books
of the city library' have been moved
from the county library', statements
yesterday to the contrary notwlth
standing. During tne afternoon Miss
Sydney Sommerville, rormerly an as
sistant in the library, went to the
county library' and under instructions
from the city library board, began the
work ot segregating the city's books.
Shortly afterward three drays ap
peared to secure the oooks but the
draymen were notified by Mia Nason,
county librarian, that the work of

Following the action of the Com

the county court served notice upon
Miss Nason not to permit any of the
books claimed by these associations to
be removed from the library building.
The city .attorney had previously serv
ed notice upon the court to deliver
these books along witn the city books
