Chihuahua City, Mex., Sept. 17.
Villa's own troops executed a surprise
attack on Chihuahua in the dark of
this morning, which although success
fully initiated, ended in u complete
victory of the de facto government
troops under Gen. Jacinto Trevino,
who received a flesh wound in the
left forearm under the fire.
At 3:30 o'clock during a heavy rain,
and while the people were asleep.
the Villa forces entered the town in
two columns. One made straight for
the pen where Jose Salazar, the am
nestied rebel on trial for plotting
against the government, and other
political prisoners were released.
Others rushed for the government
buildings and federal palace driving
out the small Carranza guard.
Gen. Trevino, rushing his troops to
vantage points, covered the govern
ment buildings with rifles and machine
guns. He then took personal com
mand of the artillery at Santa Rosa
and bya few welldirected shots made
the buildings untentable. The ban
dits, caught under alio double fire,
fled out of the city'to the northwest,
leaving 153 dead behind.

Operation.
Gen. Basil W. Duke, of Louisville,
died in a New York hospital Satur
day, following an amputation of a foot
several weeks ago. The amputation
was made necessary by an infection
of an old wound, that had recently
troubled him. Gen. Duke was born
in Scott county, Ky., May 28, 1837,
and was in the 80th year of his age.
He was educated at Danville and

Upon Which They Will Ask
Election of Hughes.
Washington, Sept. 17. Since re
cent events have clarified the atmos
phere the republican national cam
paign is taking more definite shape.
The republicans will make ue Of
three predominant issues in their big
drive to carry the country. These is
sues arc:
1. The tariff.
2. The eight-hour law.
3. The Mexican situation.
Other issues wjll be discussed, of
course, but the three mentioned will
be relied upon in the tremendously
animated contest that is to be made to
swing the country into the republican
column. Of the three it would be im
proper to describe one as having pref
erence over the. others. All three
will be made use of to a very great
extent.
The result in Maine has injected
great vitality into the tariff issue.
Those who had doubted the potency
of the protective tariff argument in
this year's campaign, in view of the
general prosperity existing, generally
have revised their opinion since they
heard from Maine.
Many a Maine voter went to the
polls and cast his ballot for the pro
tective system without caring a
whit about any other issue.
The "eight-hour" law furnishes a
new issue that has been precipitated
into the campaign with dramatic sud
denness. At first the republican
speakers took hold of it rather gin
gerly, but the indications now are
that it will be used for all there is in
it. The contention of the republican
speakers will 'be that if the executive
and legislative branches are to yield
so readily to the demands of a class
!'he foundations of the government are
unsafe. In taking the attitude that
tle administration should have insist
ed on arbitration in this matter the
republican leaders expect to strength
en their cause with the business and
employing interests of the country.
They admit President Wilson has
adroitly checkmated their effortso at
certain extent by his statement given
out on the day congress adjourned in
which he gave his pledge that the
eight-hour law is but the beginning of
legislation on the subject which, when
completed will protect all interests
concerned. A slight difficulty in mak
ing the eight-hour law an issue is the
fact that a majority of the republican
members of the house, led by former

Gen. Geo. W. Littlefield Here !

Declares He Will See That
Confederat-i President Is
Fittingly Honored.
Gen. Geo,
w.
Littlefield and
Gcn.
Bennett H. Young arrived here last
night via Nortonvilleat 5:35 and were
met by a reception committee headed
by Col. Chas. F. Jarrett.
Yesterday's Courier-Journal had
this reference to Gen. Littlefield:
"Addressing a chapel gathering at
the Confederate Home at Pewee Val
ley yesterday Gen. George W. Little
field, of Austin, Tex., a multi-millionaire
Confederate veteran, who is
interested iria project for a memorial
to President Jefferson Davis at Fair
view, Ky., said:
'I have come to Kentucky to see
that arrangements are made so that
the birthplace of Jefferson Davis has
a memorial worthy of the greatness
of the Confederate President.'
The chapel was thronged and the
announcement was greeted with keen
interest.
'This is the first time I have visited
old Kentucky since the war.' said
Gen. Littlefield,- who declared his
heart swelled with tenderness for the
State that gave such leaders as those
who had been his comrades in the
war.
At the conclusion of his address
Gen. Littletield was greeted by all
present, who shook hands with him."
The park site was purchased and
dedicated June 3, 1908, on the 100th
anniversary of the birth of Jefferson
Davis. Gen. Bennett H. Young had
advanced money to buy the old Davis
homestcaa and the work of raising
subscriptions was begun, the state
legislature appropriating $7,500. Gen
Young was reimbursed and from the
small subscriptions a fence was built
at an expense of $8,000, a handsome
stone enclosure. The state appropri
ation has nat been expended. There
are still funds to the amount of $4,500.
This small sum is not enough to start
the real improvement of the lot. Gen
Litilefield's interest has been aroused

The Kcntuckian is in receipt of a
copy of the Columbia, Tcnn., Herald
containing this article:
"Mrs. Clara Houston Meacham, a
great, great niece of Gen. Sam Hous
ton, who is the private secretary of
Miss Mildred Rutherford, is in Colum
bia to establish a circle of the Mildred
Rutherford Historical Society, whose
prime object is to promote and teach
the truth about Southern History. The
circle to be established will be the
charter circle for state and no others
will be put in at this time. The cir
cle will be called the Mildred Ruther
ford Historical Society of Maury coun
ty and will include members from Co
lumbia, Mt. Pleasant, Spring Hill, as
well as from the country sections.
"Already prominent women of this
city and Mt. Pleasant have become
interested in the formation of the cir
cle and are bending every effort to
place here one of the best organiza
tions of the entire society. Those tak
ing the lead are: of Columbia, Mrs.
Mora B. Farriss, Mrs. E. H. Hatcher,
Mrs. Sue Gray Dunnington, Mrs. J.
C. Wooten, Mrs. Robert Pillow, Mrs.
Annie White, Miss Emma Harlan,
Miss Charlotte Henderson and Miss
Mittie Elam; of Mt. Pleasant, Mrs. J.
Tate Johnson and Mrs. James Ward.
The object of the society is to en
courage the study of Southern Histo
ry, especially from economical stand
point, the bread and butter side of
Southern life. The inspiration for
the formation of the organization was
given by President Eliot, of Harvard,
when he said that the South was the
only section of the country, rich in
song and story, that had not a history
of its own; that if steps were not talc-
en at once that the South would soon
be unable to hand down to posterity
the legend of its greatness. As the
result, the society was formed at Bes
semer, Ala., in 1007. It is working
somewhat on the lines of the U. D.
C, except that its aim is broader.
"To perfect the plans being laid
by Ioc u women under the supervis
ion ot Mrs. Meacham, Miss Ruther
