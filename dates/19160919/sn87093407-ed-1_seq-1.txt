HINDU POET TAGORE
By Jack Jungmeyer
A prophet of the world's affairs directed bv
women.
Such is Sir Rabindra Nath i agore, Hindu philoso
pher, scholar, aesthete and poet, who i> todav in Seattle
at the New Washington to begin a national lecture tour
in the interest of his school in the Orient.
Attired in robe and skull cap. speaking Knglish
fluently, his brown eyes flashing behind spectacles. Sir
Rabindra Nath Tagore is the embodiment of the spiritual
messages he has set out to deliver to America.
Winner of the Nobel literary prize and knitrhted
by England's king, he is internationally almost as well
known as he is among the people of his beloved India,
to whom he is devoting a remarkable life.
He discussed for an hour at the Washington hote!
today with me the big undertakings and ideals that lie
nearest his heart.

THO; GILL WILL TRY
Bootleggers have combined into one big syndicate
with the financial backing of wholesale liquor dealers in
San Francisco and are distributing large quantities of
liquor thru the county in autos under cover of dark
ness, according to Sergeant Putnam, head of the police
dry squad.
"They are getting co-operation from at least one
railroad," he explained Tuesday, "and we are facing
the toughest problem we has* had. now, trying to un
cover them."
The Billingsleys and former Seattle saloon mer,
are cogs in the combine, he charged, hut confine their
activities to distributing large consignments.
Instead of centering supplies in drug stores, the
police have learned that trunks full of bottle eoods
are delivered to residences, often at night time.
These are merely Jobbing ata
tions," ha aald. ' and we have
learned that solicltora have regu
