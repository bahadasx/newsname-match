Government's pursuit of a gang of
blackmailers und swindlers whoso
operations have yielded more thun u
million dollars In huih money and
theft throughout tho country. It was
a gang of suiurt, fashionably dressed
women and still smarter n"ti who
preyed upon thn wealthy und prom
inent of both sexes, compromising
their victims Irrevocably, and then
Ivmaiidlng their thousands i the
price of taleuce. The ominous threat
of tho Mami White Hlnvo Act, backed
by spurious I'ultcd States wurrunts
of urrest presented by counterfeit
agents of tho Department of Justice,
wus tho weapon held over the beads
of most uf the victims.
Tho two latest arrests In the un
earthing of thu swindlers, whoso gang
numbered nt least sixty members, a
third of thorn women, were those of
William llutler In Philadelphia and
Uruco Fuller, alias (Irace Israel or
Sadie Israel, In Chicago, whero the
round-up of seven of the coterlo was
made In a fashionable hotel early last
