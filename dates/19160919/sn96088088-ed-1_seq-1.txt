QLSJj TO VUUi bbj
ii Balder Will Leave Oo
r 1 for Ten Months. i
ulah Balderree will leave! talks concerning the babies.
The Better Babies' show opens in
the tent tomorrow at nine a. m. All
babies between 12 and 48 months are
eligible.
Better babies, not just better look
ing babies, is the object of all the
fuss about "Better Babies." Not
prettv teeth but regular, well formed
hardy teeth ; not huge babies, but well
proportioned babies; not fat babies
but normal babies; not lust "babies
but "Better Babies." Children
should not be entered in better babies
contests for prizes but rather for in
formation and help.
The Better Babies contest is a pop
ular, vet scientific movement to in
sure better babies and a better race.
The Better Babies contest insures a
better race of Americans, because it
teaches parents how to improve the
physical condition ot children already
born and to protect those yet unborn
It arouses interest in the conservation
of child life and health and in all
forms of child welfare work. It forg
es a connecting link between parents
and teachers, between the home and
the scientific study of child life. It
promotes civic interest m children or
the community, their scnoois ana
their recreations. And, finally, by
means of a uniform score card, it will
supply to the medical profession what
has long been wanting scientific data
concerning the normal child.
The Better Babies contest is most
valuable to the eommunity when it is
conducted along educational rather
than competitive lines. The greatest
return which parents and children se
cure from the contest is more knowl
edge and better care through the ex
amination of the child by competent
phvsicians. Small defects are uncov
ered and remedies are suggested.
Parents leave the contest knowing
more about their children than they
ever knew before, and the children
are given a better start in life be
cause of the knowledge gained by the
parents.
A large floor-covered tent for the
Polk county fair better baby contest
has been secured. Precautions have
been taken to secure a comfortable
place for the mothers and the chil
dren. Of those who nave emereu
thoir babies and received a definite
time for examination by the physi
cians, the management requests that
they present their children promptly
at that time. There will be no nec
essity to have tbeir babies there be
fore the appointed time. Those par
ents who have not made application
are urged to see Miss Viers or Mrs.
Craven immediately.
The medal awards will be made u
the tent Thursday afternoon at three.
At that time doctors will make short

major now considers coming here next
summer with his family to remain a
month or two. They were motored
to Portland by the Major's brother,
V. P. Fiske, where he remained until
Friday evening.
During his stay Major Fiske looked
over his lots skirting the AVillam
ette near Oregon City. He is deep
ly attached to his native state and
has always cherished the hope that
he might some day be able to make
Oregon his permanent home. With
that thought in mind he hopes to
build near Oregon City and place his
family there during his periods of

Before leaving Portland he and his

JERSEY CLUB TO EXHIBIT
The body of a man, evidently
drowned during the February floods,
was brought to Dallas Friday night
by Sheriff Orr from the F. G. Mc
Lench place on the Willamette river,
five miles below West Salem. Frpm
appearances the man had been drown
ed during the February floods as the
body was bolt upright, 200 feet away
from the present edge or the nver,
and at the point reached by the high
water of last February. W. E. Hobbs
discovered the body Friday morning
about nine. Hobbs immediately phon
ed Dallas.
The flesh had entirely gone but
there was enough of the clothing left
under the belt to show that the man
had worn expensive clothing. The
shirt was of light color, soft, and
with a stripe. The trousers were of
dark blue, with a fine stripe, evident-
lv of fine material and tailor made.
A green silk tie about the neck had
neither faded nor rotted.
The upper teeth were sound, the
front pair spread apart and protrud
ing. The lower three front teeth were
bridged with crowns on either side.
Kevs were found close to the body.
Identification of the body may be
positively made by a Salem dentist.
A Mr. Springer of Salem was in Dal
las Saturday and eaxmined the body
He ay the clothes, the keys, the gen
eral build and teeth resembled thofM
of his son who disappeared rly this
year. The Salem dentist who did
work for the Springer boy has hern
asked to eome to Dallas to examine
the dental work and tell whether it
is the same as that done for his pa
tient If the dentist says the teetb
tally with those of the yornir an on
whom he worked Mr. Sprirtrer and
Coroner Chapman will consider the
identification as positive.
SOME OF FINEST CATTLE IN
OREGON TO BE SHOWN HERE
t
Polk County Has Organisation Which
Has Nation-Wide Reputation
for Fine Stock.
Some of the finest Jersey cattle in
the state of Oregon, or for that mat
ter in the whole of America, will be
shown at the Polk county fair this
week. The Polk County Jersey club,
which has been instrumental in mak
ing this county the "Jersey Isle" of
the west, intends to show Polk coun
ty people what they really have in
the line of prizewinners, and these
will be shown by various members of
the club.
In the few years of its existence
the club has distinguished itself. Lest
year at the San Francisco exposition
it carried away great bunch of priz
es, in fact it brought back to Polk
county more trophies than were taken
by the balance of the state in thit
line. The members of the club also
take considerable pride in the fact
that they have enlivened enthusiasm
in the Jersey business nntil no other
county in Oregon has as many regis
tered Jerseys as Polk.
Lest year its first annual sale was
held at Independence, and so success
ful was this that the club has an
nounced a second annual sale, to be
held at the same place on October
10th. It is expected to have 85 head
in the sale, practically all of which
are registered Jerseys or ment oi
their offspring. CoL J. W. Hughes,
the auctioneer of Forest Grove, will
ery the sale, and W. O. Morrow, pres
ident of the elub, is sales manager.
MAJOR FISKE LEAVES.
Expects to Return Next Snmmsr for
Longer Visit.
After a week's visit with relatives
in 'Dallas, Major Fluke and little
daughter left last Thursday morning
for Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. They
Salem will have a large represen
tation at the Polk county fair this
year. At a meeting of the Cherrian
club, the live wire businessmen's or
ganization of that city, last Friday
night, it was decided to send a large
bunch of- Salem boosters to the fair
and they expect to come on a spec
ial train tomorrow. The committee
in charge of the excursion is headed
by Wm. Gahlsdorf and T. L. Billings
ly, and they promise not less than 50
for the special. The Salem Cherrian
band will accompany them and play
at the grounds.
The invitation to attend the fair
was personally given by President I.
L. Patterson, who spoke briefly to the
club, saying it would be of benefit
to both Salem and Polk county if ev
erybody was better' acquainted.
Speaking editorially about the trip
and the good will it should foster, the
Statesman had the following to say
Sunday:
Public-spirited Salem people should
rally to the call of the Cherrians to
go with the special excursion to Dal
las next Wednesday to attend the
Polk county fair for an afternoon.
Since the invitation presented in
behalf of the people of Polk county
by I L Patterson at the Cherrian
meeting Friday night there can be no
doubt that Dallas is eager to have a
visit from Salem. The invitation
comes that the spirit of co-operation
between tbe two cities may be main
tained not to re-establish a spirit
of co-operation for there has never
been any lack of it as far as the real
big men of each eommunity are concerned.
Now and then something is heard
about a jealousy existing between the
two places. It is not true and never
has been.
Both towns are vital factors in the
state and each has its function to per
form.
Laliberte Hop Hons Burnt.
Fire destroyed the H. Laliberte bop
house near Independence Thursday
morning. The drying kilns and the
hops from a two-acre tract were burn
ed. The loss is covered by insurance.
Standing within a few feet of the

ed with hay valued at $7,000. The
warehouse was saved by the good
work of the fire boys.
