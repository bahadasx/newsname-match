town for two weeks. The North Poult
ney school will also be closed for two
weeks.
The Fair Haven graded school and
the school In the south district in

ing. The patient at North Poultney is

inity of the spot where the tragedy
occurred between 9 and 10 o'clock and
all of them report seeing two men
standing on the trolley track west of
the highway.
it is presumed that the description
of the two men given the officers
tallied to some extent with the ap
peal ances of the three men who were
placed under arrest this afternoon.

afternoon from Manchester to con

Monday afternoon and evening two
men were lodged in the lockup and
this morning two more were placed
under arrest. Monday afternoon
George Bailey, a stranger who has
been about town for several days, was
lodged in jiil. On the night of the
murder Baiiey was found intoxicated
f.u the tracks ot the rtuuana rauruau
north of the engine house by one of
the railroad company employes. Ed-
Ward McGuire. Fearing that the man
might he run over by a train. Mcliuire
took Bailey some distance from the
tracks. The man is being held so that
he mav give an account of his actions
luring the night.
Monday afternoon Deputies John
Nash and Perry II. Gardner made an
iiitomobile trip to Fagle Bridge and
Hooslck Falls in search of a man
whose action:; were of a suspicious
nut ure. I hey traced the man from.
Fagle Bridge to HOOSick Falls. At
the latter village the trail was lost, '
but early in the evening he arrived I
In Bennington on a trolley car and
was placed under arrest. He gave his
name a. Morgan ami tout a number 01
different stories. From his actions and
appearance the man is a broken down
wanderer, both physically and menial
ly, and the officials do not believe
that he could possibly have been con- j

This morning. Victor Young, a
painter living on County street, and
who was one of the last persons who
saw Costello before he was killed,
was placed under arrest as a witness.
Costello accompanied Young home
Saturday night from the American 1
House barroom. According to all re
porta Young was intoxicated at the
time but Costello was sober. It was
from the Young house that Costello
must have gone directly to the Ver

his death. The ofllcers have not at
