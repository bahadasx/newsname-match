NEW YORK, Sept. 19. Betting the Presidential
election is more active today than at any time during the
campaign.
One wtiger of $20,000 on Hughes at 2 to 1 was reported.
Wilson money is more plentiful today, though, than
for the last few weeks, and odds on Hughes are waver

One uptown brokerage house, it 1b said, has $100,000

CROWD OUT TO SEElANTI-TRUST SUIT
T
'When the naval civilian consulting
board met In the oft lee of Secretary
Daniels today .to consider a site for the
new 11,600,000 experimental laboratory
the contest for the plant had narrowed
dawn to Washington md some slto near
New York city.
Opposed to Washington are Thomas
A. Edison, chairman, and a number of
the'members of the board whose offices
are In New York. Favoring: Washing
ton are officers of the navy, who hold
the Capital to be the logical site. Sec
retary Daniels has the deciding voice,
but he has not Indicated whether he
will be guided by the wishes of thq
civilian board or his naval advisers.
The civilian board organized today.
Secretary Daniels, In an opening ad
dress, praised their patriotic service to
the country. Tonight tho board will go
down the Potomac on the 'Dolphin to
see target practice oft the Virginia
capes.
Indicates Edison's Opposition.
An Indication that Chairman Edison
will vigorously contest the choice of
Washington as a site for the research
laboratory was given by Dr. Miller
Ileese Hutchison, the Inventor's as
sistant and spokesman.
"Washington Is eliminated," Dr.
Uutcbison said before the meeting:.
"It Is' essential that there shall be a
water' depth of thlrty-Uve or forty
feet so that battleships may be an
chored alongside the laboratory."
May Delay Selection.
It was at Mr. Edison's Insistent sug
, gtsllon that 8ecreiajx. Daniels had
stricken triwv the itav.il tlll'li,'pttra
giuph designating Washington us a
ffite for tho laboratory.
Naval offlcluli hold, however, thnt

that any tiattleshlp studios can be made

DETROIT, , Sept. 1. Detroit was
baseball mad today as the Tigers and
Red Sox prepared to go to the mat In
the three-game aeries which may de
termine flag-winner In the American
League.
The two teams are now virtually
tied for the top position In the per

about 2 points, and the winner of the
series will have an edge on alt oppo

There was real football sip to the

to offset the cool breezes.

probably will be chosen to battle for
honors In the opener, although for
Boston Mays and Leonard are also
possibilities.
Both teanls will enter the fray with

CHICAGO, Sept. 19. While Federal

ward, alleged to be the real head of
the blackmail syndicate whose head
quarters hsre were raided Sunday
morning, the eight members of the
gang caught then were arraigned be
fore the United States commissioner
here.
Hlnton G. Clabaugh, of the Depart
ment of Justice, gave some cheering
news for the wealthy men and wom
en victims today, when he declared he
had enough evidence to convict the
band of using the Mann white-slave
act aa a weapon to blackmail, with
out exposing the names of some of
them who paid large sums for se
crecy to the syndicate.
Air. Clabaugh also revealed that it
was through ithe "squallng of Frank
Crocker, now under surveillance In Phil-
oaeipnia, that the full extent of the
operations of the gang became known to
the department.
Crocker Didn't Get His Share.
"We've got Frank Crocker In Philadel

turo and not Intimate In any respect.
Miss Edith DcGray, defendant In a )50,

answer to the dlvorco bill In which she
was named co-respondent.
Miss DcGray declares that the allega
tions In tho absolute divorce petition of
Mrs. Edna Cox "are unfounded, unwar
ranted, and unjustifiable," and the be
lief Is expressed that the naming of her
In the separation proceedings "would
be of benefit to Mrs. Cox In her damage
suit."
The court Is asked to dismiss the (II-ou-u
petition ns far ns It relates to Miss
DeGro- Strict proof of the allegations
In the divorce action are demanded.
No effort is made by Miss DcGray to
deny acquaintance with Cox, and no
knowledament is mndo of scvernl meet
ings with Cox. In explanation of these
meetings, Miss DcGruy's answer de
clares "her several meotings with Levi
C. Cox have always been In public
places when her actions and conduct
hne been above repronch, freo from
an suggestion of Intimacy, and subject
to the observation of persons who wcio
present."
The nnswer asserts that Miss De
Giay "has never at any time been in
the rnmnnnv or nrcsenCC Of Levi C.
Cox under nny circumstances from
which It could be Inferred, or even sus
pected by anyone that there were any
Intimate or Improper relations botween
herself and Cox."
The answer calls the court's atten
tion to tho fact that In Mrs. Cox's suit
In which Miss DoGray is accused of
alienating the affections of Cox no
mention Is made of the alleged intl
mncy between Cox and the defendant.
