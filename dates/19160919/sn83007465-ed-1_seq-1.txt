Van Wyck is taking on now life
since the business season has opened j
up. The brick yard is running on'
full time and turning out fine brick1
by the thousands every day. Ai
number of teams are busy hauling{
wood for burning these and everything
around the brick plant is mov-1
ing and gives the scene an air of!
thrift and progress. The clay for
making brick her? la tine and enough |
to keep the plant running for years, j
The cotton gin fills the air with its
musical hum as it ?operates the fleecy
etaple from its seed and is doing fine
work under the supervision of Mr.
Will Yorborough. This ginery has
recently been overhauled, and a good
deal of new maeliinery added, which
make# it well equipped for business. '
and v.e bespeak a liberal patronage1'
for the company which has gone to
considerable expense to please their
1 j
customers. The cotton crop is short
in this territory and will not give the
owners of this gin plant much profit '
this season.
The merchants have opened up a '
good line of fall goods and are busy/
selling to the fall trade, and will)'
buy cotton, and seed and give the (
highest market prices, and believe in '
the slogan: "Buy at Home."
We are getting tine roads from all
directions to Van Wyck. The Northeast
Road, or the Monroe Road, leading
from Cureton's Ferry towards J
Waxhaw and Monroe is now being'
graded by the experienced road
builder. Mr. J. A. Hyatt, and when
finished will oe among the best
roads in the county. This is a much 1
i j
traveled road and for several years
has been in a deplorable condition,
and almost a disgrace to Lancaster I
county. The county board has our '
thanks for having the work done. It j
is rumored that a new ferry boat
will soon be installed at Cureton s
and when this Is done it will give
more travel on our roads and will be 1
u great convenience for this part of 1
Lancaster county and the travel to 1
Rock Hill. As it now is, the only(1
place for crossing Catawba river for J
tome distance is near Fort Mill.
The weather continues dry and
fine for gathering feed crops, but un-,
fortunately here in the flood district.1
there is very little to gather. The '
forage crops were destroyed by the
floods and very little hay grasses
have grown since. The pasture grasses
were destroyed and very few
places, if any, grass has grown?
enough for stock to feed upon.
"Some farms here where a hundred
tons of hay were grown other years, j
will not produce more than two or
three tons, and the farmers will have j
to depend on imported feed supplies, j
This is a new experience for many of j
our farmers, as they have never
farmed much in cotton, always
making their home supplies, and
these largely on their low lands,
along streams that seldom overflowed
to such an extent, as to cause a,
total loss." Tlut this "record breaker
flood" of July has taught them a
lesson?never again to depend entirely
on the low lands for a supply
crop. They are going bravely on.
preparing for grains and grasses that
will coma In early in the spring, that
will help them over the hard experiences
of their farm operations next

LOCATION FOR FAIR

Uould Exhibit Products of Little
Town?Would Prove Bene:
ticial to Community.
One among the best locations in |
Lancaster county in which to hold a
genuine first class community fair is
Heath Springs. Surrounded by a(
iplendid agricultural section noted
'or the fertility of its soil, and in-'
labited by a progressive class of!
l-i 1- I

he little town enjoys every facility1

'onduct a one or two days fair.
In the vicinity of Heath Springs

he State. Among some of the best
'artners in the county are located in
his particular climatic favored secion,
and the ability of the Heath
Springs graded school to arrange a
suitable exhibit for an occasion of
his kind has been demonstrated at
the many field day and local fairs
in this city time and time again.
Heath Springs has splendid fair
grounds already in that of its ball
park. Suitable tents could be rented
it a small cost in which the various
exhibits could be shown. A small
line vt clean up-to-date amusements
ould be located in the grounds on
a pecentage basis which would net
I he fair management a neat sum. A
small admission could be charged at
the gate which could be used in defraying
the general expenses in connection
with the fair. It would not
he necessary to give a large cash premium
list, as those interested in such
work will, as a general rule, work
,s hard to secure a "blue ribbon" for
a prize as if it were a fifty cents or
a dollar. At a very small cost the unlertaking
could be thoroughly advertised.
and of a certainty it would
prove of an incalculable worth to the
town and entire community from an
advertising, competitive and constructive
standpoint.
The real worth ot such an undertaking
cannot be estimated In dollars
and cents to a community in that it
tends to create a competitive spirit.

in which they endeavor to outdo
tlieir neighbor in the high production
of those things s?> essential in ones

to the general good of a community
and the welfare of its people.
So far, live community fairs are
to he held in the county this fall at
the following places: Flint Kidge.
Van Wyck, Oakhurst, Antioch and
Pleasant Valley, and much work is
now under way at these places in
order to make them a success. In
all probability, a co nty fair will be
held in Lanacster this fall.. Committees
are busy today soliciting
financial aid from the local merchants
and business men for this
purpose, and, of course, Lancaster
WILL NOT FAIL.
Now, if the citizens of Heath
Springs, assisted by the many farmers
and stock men of the section,
want to hold an event of this kind
for one or two days during the fall,

Funeral of Mrs. Annie Wilson (

Columbia, Sept. 17..?Simple, almost
to austerity, will be the funeral b
today of Mrs. Annie Josephine e

M. I)., of Columbia and sister of w
President Wilson, which will be held e
in the First Prtsbyterian church on tl

Service Will He llrief. r
The funeral service will consist of '
two scripture readings, a prayer and 1
three hymns. One of the hymns will
be sung as the funeral party enters,
the church. It is likely that the so '
lections will be "Abide With Me,"
"Jesus Lover of My Soul" and "My
Faith Looks Up to Thee." Two hymns '
will likely be sung by a quartette dur- '
ing the commital. One of these may '
' (
be "Beautiful Garden of Kden,"i
which was sung at the funerals ofi
Mrs. Howe's father, Or. Joseph Rug- '
gles Wilson, and her husband, George j
Howe, M. I). The prayer will be of- '
fered by the president of Columbia

a few others will be reserved in the

Congressman Nicholls Doesn't A
Want Him in Office?Fight
to He Made.
Washington, Sept. 15.-?Interesting
developments are promised at an ^
early date over the Greenville post- n
office appointment. ^
RATtrMAntntlva Sum T V!,.k..l1- tl
said today: ^
"I have already attested that the action
of the postmaster general was a p
complete surprise to me. You may ?
rest assured that 1 will do everything ^
in my power to put Mr. Traxler out.
I have not fully decided upon the best
course to pursue in the matter, but 11
I expect to go to the bottom of it. f
Further than this I do not care to i!
make any statement at the present |K
time." ^
In 1913 there was an agreement l<
I among the members of the South
Carolina delegation in congress, the ?
house members and the two senators E
agreeing, that the house members v
would have the naming of the post- ' P
masters in their respective districts (l
and that the senators would not interfere
except where recomtnenda- *
tions were personally objectionable. '
This agreement has been strictly ad- '
hered to and the question that Mr. "
Nicholls will ask just as soon as 11
Postmaster (Jeneral Hurleson returns
to Washington is who Mr. Traxler's
sponsor was. '
It is not known that either Sena- '
tor Smith or Senator Tillman took '
a hand in the present situation and '
it is interesting to know who did. v
With tiie elimination <>f the South
Carolina senators, there remains the '
question of who it was with sufficient 1
influence to have the postmaster gen- '
era! tell Mr. Traxler that he might '
go back to work as postmaster at '
Cleenville after what has happened 11
during the last three months.
Mr Nicholls, in demanding of th?- '
postmaster general that Mr. Traxler - *
resignation remain as submitted '
some time ago. will stand squarely ?'
on his official rights, he said, and will
insist that his prerogatives as the re
presentative in the house from the i!
Fourth district of South Carolina be ?
respected. On the other hand. The ''
State's correspondent has informa- '
tion to show that Mr. Traxler's ^
friends will insist that the postofflce '
department stand by its decision and ?
continue him in the postotlice.
Altogether the situation over the '
continuance of Mr. Traxler as postmaster
at (Jreenville is one of the
promised features of official life in
the near future. P
