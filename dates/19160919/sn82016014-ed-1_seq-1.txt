Kansas Motor Car company on Quincy '
street. It is charged that Saturday
night he left the garage where he has
been employed for eighteen months
with all the collections for the night,
amounting to from $12 to J20.
He was turned over to the county
and his actions indicated he was un
der the Influence of some kind of
drug. Questions brought out the fat
that he is addicted to the use of mor
phine. His left arm furnished all the
evidence the officers needed. The in
quisition turned from the charge
against him to the matter of drugs.
Tells of inircliasc.
"Yes. sir," he said in answer to a
question, "X have been buying drugs
by express. I send to G. D. Harris in
Memphis, Tenn.. and get them when
ever I need them. I send $5 and he
sends me the amount that much
money buys. I address him at 'gen
eral delivery' in Memphis."
Bower denied he had sold any or
the drugs but the man who filed the
complaint against him told what he
knew and Kower weakened.
"The day before he left my garage."
said Mr. Haney. his employer, "he
t. d to borrow $18 of a man I know.
He told him he had $300 worth of
drugs at an express office in town
and that if he could get the $18 he
could set the-drugs out of the office
and sell enough to pay back the $18
in no time."
Was a Good Kmploye.
Bower has been employed at the
garage for nearly tv o years, and has
been trusted by all of the various
owntrs of the place. He has served
"nitrht man." has collected the
monev for cars taken out during the
niiht" and for easoline sold after the
office closed. Patrons of the garage
know him as "Dad." and have had a
prpt deal of confidence in him, al
though he has been known to be a
user of drugs.
Siphoned Gas From Cars.
"1 did not suspect him of anything.
although I had frequent complaints
about things being missing from their
cars." said Mr. Haney. "Recently
patrons have been complaining that
a part of their gasoline disappeared at
night while their cars were stored in
the earage. 1 employed a man to
watch during the night through a
hack window. He reported to me that
Dad' went through the garage with a
bucket :- 1 a hose, siphoned the gaso
line from private cars out into the
bucket and sol ' it to jitney drivers."
Bower made a sworn statement in
the presence of W. E. Atc.iison. county
attorney. 1 others today, and it will
lie ruri.pil over o federal officials. It
deals with his alleged purchase of
morphine and drugs from Harris in
Memphis. The Harris referred to

known io county officers. Bower said
ik mnda the arrangement with him
before Harris - ent to Memphis.
A warrant was issued for Bower,
charging him with stealing money
from ths Kansas Motor Car company,

desire to push it; that all he wanted
was his moi However, the county
officers wanted the warrant issued in
order to hold Bower for federal

Bishop Coadjutor of Episcopal
Church To Be amed.
Many Candidates Being Pushed
by Friends.
One hundred clergy and lay dele-
gates from all parts of Kansas are 1
an attempt to choose the first bishop
coadjutor in the history of the diocese
of Kansas. Considerable excitement
was prevalent at the. meeting, for sev
eral candidacies are being actively
pushed, as the office is next to that of
the bishop, the most important that
the diocese of Kansas can bestow.
A similar convention was hed two
years ago to elect an assistant to
Bishop Millspaugh. but the conven
tion developed an unbreakable dead
lock, and the meeting was adjourned.
Bishop Millspaugh has insisted on per
forminc unassisted the labors of the
diocese for the past two years, but t
rapidly failing health has made the j
present cm.v.nuuu imperative.
Dr. Percy Fenn of Wichita, is the i
Kansas man mentioned most promi-!
nently for the place. At the conven-i
tion of two years ago he came nearly
being elected
Atchison delegates are urging the
selection of the Rev. Francis S. "White,
of Grand Rapids, Mich., formerly pas
tor of the Trinity church at Atchison.
Many other delegates are in favor of
the plan.
The first event of the convention
was a talk by Bishop Millspaugh, in !
which he explained the duties of the
coadjutor.
At a late hour this afternoon the
voting had failed to elect.
The Rev. G. M. Geisel, canon of
Grace cathedral, was nominated by
John Stone. Other nominees were:
The Rev. Percy T. Fenn, of Wichita;
the Rev. Even S. Edwards, Lawrence;
C. Rollet, secretary of the sixth pro
vince of the Episcopal church; the
Rev. Douglass I. Hobbs, Newton, and
the Rev. James Wise, St. Louis.

operating under heavy guards. It is
understood that even stricter methods
of protection are bein considered.
Investigation of a fire which de
stroyed a large canning factory here

Iola, Kan.. Sept. 19. An arduous
task in selecting the jury was in sight
apparently when the trial began here
today of Miss ftuby Stevens, con
fessed slayer of Clifford Kistner, a
wealthy young farmer, who, she de
clares, ruined her life. Attorneys
went carefully into the history of each
venireman and inquired particularly
as to what attitudes prospective jurors
would take on the questions of un
written law and emotional insanity.
Prospects were that a new panel
would be drawn before tonight.
Miss Stevens was dressed in black
and her face showed the pallor of five
months' confinement in the county

attractively dressed, despite reports -i

The 1 4. 0 0 0 Xational Guardsmen en

their northward march, despite the
fact that they had just emerged from

marched by a more direct route.
There ensued a sham battle that for
noise and excitement was nearly the
real thing. Artillery, machine gun
and rifle fire echoed thru the town
for hours. General Funston, who wit
nessed the maneuvers with his staff,
pronounced them a technical success.
Greene's column left for Hunter, ten

northern Mexico against Villa, as they
invariably desert him at the first op
portunity. Military men here do not underesti
mate the importance of Villa's attack
on Chihuahua city, and declare that
all northern Mexico is now at the
mercy of the bandit leader. They
point out that the city is the strong
est military fortress in the north, and
that it was defended by heavy artillery
and a garrison of 7.000 men.
Carries Out Threat.
Despite this strength. Villa, after
openly boasting he would attack the '
city Independence day, made good hi
threat, entered the town, released
prisoners and withdrew. carrying
away ammunition and supplies and
taking with him more than a thou
sand deserters from the Carranza gar
rison. Scores of the refugees from
Chihuahua city arrived in Juarez last
night, bringing first-hand accounts of
the attack. Only two civilian resi
dents of the city were injured, and
none of the few American residents.
In the tarly fighting the Villlstas
herded all civilians who appeared on
the streets into a vacant building and
kept them inside while the fighting
was in progress. All Incoming refu
gees from the south declare that a
large number of de facto troops de
serted and marched away with Villa
with their arms and ammunition.
Before beginning the retreat, six
automobiles, commandeered by th
bandits, were backed up to the arse
nal and loaded with ammunition.
Four hundred Carranza mutineers
guarded them on the march out. Most
of the 1 200 political prisoners in the
prison were released by the Villlstas.
General Gonzales has reinforced the
Juarez garrison with men and artil
lery. The Carranza officials frankly
admit their fears of an attack upon
Juarez by Villa's forces.
