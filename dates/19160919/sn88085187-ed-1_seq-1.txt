SENSATION IN BILLINGS TRIAL
T.R.&P. Power Plants Crippled; City Carries Load
WATER
LOW IN
RIVERS
T-lectrie juice from Taco
ma's power planl on the
\i-ipi.ilU i-iver Ih hauling all
street cars in thi-- city Tues
day afternoon and evening,
ln-siilr- furnishing motive
power for nearly half tho
electric cars in Seattle.
The Stone-Webster interests,
.acing an unusual shortage of wa
ter in White river, which sup
lilies the I.a lu> Tapps power plant,
and Puyallup river, supplying
Electron, was so hard pressed for
electric current Tuesday that it
made an urgent request for mv-
nicipai power.
The city agreed to sell 5,000
kilowatts of current tor a period
of 12 hours, commencing Tues
day afternoon. The price, under
emergency rates, will be $27 an
hour.
This Is the first time that the
city lias been asked to furnish
current for operating street cars
of the Tacoma Railway & Power
Co.
The cut-over is simplified be
cause large switches were in
stalled last winter when the city
and powes company signed a
franchise-contract by which either
corporation could purchase emer
gency electricity from the other.
Operate Kxtra Dynamo*.
T.ast Saturday, when the short
age of water first became evi
dent, the city furnished 2,500
kilowatts of current to the street
car company, simply for experi
mental purposes.
Two sets of generators at the
I.aOrande station were put to
work, operating separately from
the two generators furnishing
Juice to the city for domestic and
commercial purposes.
This current was brought to
Tacoma on the auxiliary trans
mission line, and turned directly
over to the T. R. & P. Co.
Steam Plant Running.
At 2 o'clock Tuesday morning
the Stone-Webster people made
their first appeal to the city for
emergency current. They re
ported that low water in the
rivers was causing their reser
voir storage to decrease at an
alarming rate.
Although there are three hydro
electric plants under control of
the syndicate—Lake Taps, Elec
tron and Snoqualmie—there was
not enough juice from the com
bined system to operate cars in
Tacoma and Seattle.
The company has already
started its steam auxiliary plant
at Georgetown and may be forced
to get its Tacoma steam plant
ready for operation, if tho low
water crisis continues.

Tough Job, This
Sending Thousand
Strikers to Jail
The Chicago, Milwaukee & St.
Paul railway is having a desperate
time trying to land the thousanu
odd members of the Tacoma
Longshoremen's union In jail;
and the longshoremen so far ap
parently are having it all their
own way.
No long ago the railway tried
to have the officers and members
of the union punished for con
tempt of court, alleging they had
violated the restraining order is
sued Aug. 14.
Federal Judge Frank Rudkin
put the kibosh on the railway's
hopes.
Now a New Move
He ruled that the onl> way the'
longshoremen could be punished
would be to have criminal charges
brought against each Individual
member, stating distinct viola
tions of the restraining order.
Aluo he held that contempt pro
ceedings could not be brought by
a civil action against the whole
bunch.
Meanwhile Assistant District
Attorney ITshburne isn't ready to
load 1000 separate criminal cases
on his own hands.
Now the railroad, despairing of
getting Judge Kudkin to punish
tlie strikers, is off on a new tack.
It is going to try Judge Cushman
on the same thing when he re
turns from the south.
So the railway has filed an

APPEASE
UNIONS
Will the labor unions of Taco-j
ma and the Taconia Commercial;',
club wipe out pust resentments |
und get together to work 111 har
mony for the interests of the,
city?
This proposition, suggested
editorially by The Times recent- j
ly, ii being put before the Cen-. '
tral Labor Council and the varl-7
ous unions of the city this week.
|| an understanding can be ,
reached, it may result in the for
mation of a labor bureau of the
Commercial club, through which I
organized labor may take a hand 1
in the club's activities.
The "law and order" resolution'
of the Commercial club, which,'!
organized labor claims, was aim- '
ed directly at the longshoremen;
in an attempt to discredit them, i
and which has caused the great-1
est resentment. Is the chief thing!
which stands in the way of har-1
moiiy.
Plan Ip to Unions.
The harmony plan is up to (
the unions as the result of a con
ference in the Commercial club
last night between the club's
trustees and 14 representatives of J
Tacoma labor organizations, in
cluding the president and secre-1
tary of the Central Labor Council, ;
officers of the railway meu'B or
ganizations and representatives of
the striking longshoremen and
lumber handlers.
The conference was called at
the invitation of the club's ffus
tees, who tried to explain their
"law and order" statement,
which, they said, had led to
misunderstandings.
J. T. S. Lyle, the club's spokes
man, declared the statement was
not aimed at tlie strikers, but was
only a declaration for law and
order in the city.
The union men, while not com
pletely satisfied that the trustees
had not acted through prejudice
against the strikers, agreed to
repo:t the conference to their or
ganizations. They declared the
club's resolution clearly had sent
out the impression that the long
shoremen favored violence.
Those Present.
Among those who attended the
conference were W. E. Horn,
president of the Central Labor
Council; Rea Last, secretary;
J. 1). Smythe, secretary of the
railway engineers; D. L. Richard
son, secretary of the railway
trainmen; W. T. Morris, T. J.
Bjorklund, A. C. Hill, C. H. Grant
and Arne Jones, representing the
longshoremen.
A committee of the Commercial
club, Including R. D. McDonald,
chairman; W. H. Pringle and J.
T. S. Lyle, Is Investigating the
feasibility of the proposition.
