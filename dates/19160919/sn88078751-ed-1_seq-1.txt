Poles in Chicago's West Side foreign
quarter, panic-stricken by failure of
several private banks. Jammed and
fought their way into a state bank In
that district and created a run on the
Institution. The bank was that or
Schlff & Company, which has more
than 2,GO0,000 in deposits and Is be
lieved to bo absolutely solvent.
Police protection was asked. More
than 150,000, mostly in savings os
counts. had been withdrawn when tho
bank closed. Samuel S. Schuster,
cashier, announced there is plenty of
money on hand and that all depos
itors who wish will bo paid.
Schuster blamed the run on the ex
citement caused by the crash of tho
Silver & Company, Michael Michniulc
& Sons nnd tho M. Ginsburg & Sons,,
private banks, within a few weeks.
"Our instltut'on is absolutely solvent,"
he said, "but we aro powerless to
avert what Is happening."
