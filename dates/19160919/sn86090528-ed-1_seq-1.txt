London, Sept, 10. Great .battles be
tween whole fleets of land dread
naughts may result from the introduc
tion of new motor ear construction in
to the Somme fighting, a British cor
respondent of the London Times fit
headquarters suggests.
"In one hour," the correspondent
wired, "the tanks did more military
service and killed more soldiers than
all the, Zeppelins have ever done. They
may, before the war is over, govern
the fighting and all the allies nisiv
l.uild other monsters, each bigger and
more horrible, until there will be land
battles in which whole fleets of dreari
naughts are engaged."
Only One Tank Destroyed.-
Only one tank was destroyed in the
Somme fighting. One monster lies
with its nose in the earth between the
opposing lines in" the Boultaux woods,
hut the manner of its destruction has
not been revealed.
A steady downpour has halted Brit
ish operations along the Somme where,
important fighting has taken placi
since yesterday.
Serbs in Native Land. "
The Serbs are ugaiu fighting on the'r
native soil for the first time since
their retreat through Albania last win

frontier north of Lake Ostrovo.

"Tanks" Adapted from Farm Plow
Washington, Sept. 19. The British
"tanks." the armored motor cars used
in recent assault (on German trenches
in northern Trance so successfully as
to at trait world-wide attention, were
built, for the most part, in Peoria, 111.,
in the form of caterpiller tractors, de
signed many years before the war be
gun to meet some of the difficult proli
h ins of modern farming. Except for
their armor, their machine guns and
their crews, thousands like them are
in use today in the United States in
plowing, digging ditches and other la
bors less heroic than war.
M. M. Baker, vice president of a
manufacturing company, said here to
day: "We have sold about l.f'Ofl caterpil
lar tracto-s to the British government.
We have had nothing to do with put
ting armor on them or placing ma
chine guns.
"Germany had sonio of these trae.
tir betore Uie war began, ai.d al
though I do not understand Just ho
it occurred, I believe she may have got
others since then. We have sent some
to Frame and some to Russia. So far
as I know up until the recent appear
ance of the motor -cars tho tractor.!
were used unly to tow big guns. I
understood that Germany had used
about forty of them in this work be
fore Liege early in the war and re
cent photographs show that the Brit
ish are using some of them now for
the same purpose."
Mr. Baker said he did not know how
many of the 1,000 tractors sent to Eng
land had been armored and put in sor.
vice.
"It Is true," said Mr. Baker,, "that
these tractors can go ahead over al
most anything or through almost any
thing. They can straddle a trench, go
through a swamp, roll over logs or
climb through shell craters like a car
or Juggernaut. It looks uncanny to
see them crawl along the ground just
like a lingo caterpillar. In a thick for
est, if they encountered trees they
could not brush out of their way, they
could easily be used to uproot them
and clear their own way."

KILLED BY TRAIN;
IS BURIED HERE
Brief services for A. W. Webb, who
was killed in the Santa Fe yards in
Oklahoma City Saturday, were held
at the I. O. O. F. cemetery yesterday,
being conducted by Rev. J. M. Hindi.
Mr. Webb, who until the past few
months was a resident of this city, was
struck by a swift engine which came
up behind him, and died about thirty
minutes later. An explanation of the
accident is given in the fact that
trains were being switched on paral
lel tracks, and he was engaged in
watching the train of the other track
and did not notice the engine which
was behind him.
The deceased leaves a wife and
three : children. An eight-year-old
daughter died in Chickasha last Jan
uary and he was laid to rest beside
her.- When Mr. Webb lived in this
city he was employed by the Chicka
sha Cot I on Oil company and resided
at 022 North Seventh.
DIMMINGLAW IS
UP TO SAMMY
Sammy's estimate of the brillianc.'
of auto lights as well as his speed
ometer are the last word in traffic
law. That is the dictum of Mayor
Coffman. If Sammy says the lights
are too bright they are too bright. If
Sammy says they must be dimmed
that is what goes. But the traffic off
cer has been' cautioned to exercise his
usual discretion and it is not the pur
pose of the administration to impose a
hardship on auto owners or to deprive
them of any of the legitimate joys of
life.
"The motor officer will see that tho
lights are dimmed within the city lim
its. He will use his own judgment as
to whether a certain light is too bright
as construed by the law which went
into effect last Friday. If he considers
it an infraction of the ordinance he
will not be harsh in any case and he
does not regard this law as solely i
possible revenue getter. When Sam
my tells the driver of an automobile
to dim his lights of course it will he
to the advantage of such driver to do
so."
Miss Sara Crofford left this after
noon for Duncan. Okla.. where she will
spend several days with friends.

JACK EXHIBIT OF
SUPERIOR CLASS
Of the genuine registered stock ex
hibited at the Grady County Fair none
was of purer strain, perhaps, than the
horse, jack and jennet exhibit of W
E. Smith, president of the fair asso
ciation and prominent prize wlune;
at the big fairs of Dallas, Texas, und
Oklahoma. In the carload of stock
which he has sent to the state fair at
Oklahoma are animals which must
win recognition. Among nis prize win-
I ners at Chickasha were the following;
Baron Elora, one of the handsomest
stallions ever seen in this state, took
the ribbon as the champi'on stud of
any breed or age at the show here a.
ha has done at other places.
Of the jacks and jennets Mary
Green, which captured the blue rib
bon as the grand champion mare at
Dallas in 1!H3, carried off the same
honors in Chickasha last week. Miss
Temple, who was first in her class fat
the Dallas State Fair in lft 1.1 and wus
the source of great admiration here,
where she was a blue ribbon winner,
weighs 1310 pounds and stands lO'j
hands high. Mary Green is one of
the prides of the Union Hill farm
The renowned fine stock authority,
Frank B. Graham, who judged at San
Francisco and other big fairs, said oi
Mary Green before the jack associa
tion at the Dallas fair that she was the
best jeuet in the world. The-colt was
sired by Highball, the highest priced
jack in the world, who was shown
against 300 head and was never de
feated, and was foaled by Vera Mr.
Whorter, another famous animal. The
Smith entry took the grand champio'i
prize at the Fat Stock Show at Fort
Worth.
Mr. Smith took more ribbons last
year than any jack breeder In the
state and is not lagging in 1!l'i.
