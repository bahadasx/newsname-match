fered ah average loss of .11.38 per cent,
which In individual cases was much
Heavier because in certain cases the
loss is oflfset by high prices.

Federal Officials Not Sure
They Can Convict All of
Alleged Blackmailers.
MRS. KLIPPER COMES
WEST TO TESTIFY
Philadelphia Divorcee Who Was Swin
dled by Gang Ready to Giv* Evidence
—Probably Will B« Able to Identify
Three of Those Undsr Arrest—Gov
ernment Ordera Names of Other
We^thy Victims. Kept Secret.
Chicago, Sept. 19.—'Four members of
the alleged $1,000,000 band of black
mailers may escape prosecution, fed
eral officials admitted today as they
waited the preliminary hearing, set for
2 p. m. of the seven prisoners.
Mrs. Regina Klipper, a divorcee of
Philadelphia, the government's chief
witness, arrived early in the day under
guard of federal agents, to appear
against the alleged blackmailers.
Hinton G. Clabaugh. of the United
States department of Justice, said he
was confident Mrs. Klipper would
identify Edward Donahue, Henry Rus
sell and Mrs. Helen Evers as directors
of the organization.
"The case against the others under
arrest," Clabaush said, "Is doubtful.
I am satisfied, however, of the guilt of
't"1 fij-st three."
Russell. Donohue and Mrs. Evers are
held under bail of $25,001 each. The
others under nrre^t are limps Chris
tian. .Times Blnnd. Mrs. Donahue and
Mrs. Frances Allen, alias Chnpmnn.
TIr '»onds of these four were fixed at
to.ftOO each.
Mrs. Klipoer Is th» sole woman of
the sooros believed to he victims nf
the svndicate who is willing to tell
how she was fleeced. She declares
she was placed in a compromising
nosltlon in a New York hotel last
January, blackmailed out of a sum
said to he less than 41.000 and some
Jewelry, and later kidnaped and held
In Montreal.
Victims to. Be Shielded.
The reputations of wealthy persons
snared by the blackmailing syndicate
exposed by the federal authorities are
to be protected.
Orders came from Washington last
night to Hinton C. Clabaugh, division
chief, of the department tt justice
agents, instructing^ him no^ to reveal
tlt»-aaines~of jiny4of tHe meteor women
who paid money Ur keep from dis
grace.
The same order'instructed him zeal
ously to guard from the public eye a
bundle of compromising photographs
and a stack of letters which reflect on
those fleeced. Federal officials frankly
admit that were these to become pub
lic several Chicago households at least
would be for rent and some heretofore
spotless reputations besmirched.
The order from Washington is
pected to sweep aside some of the re
luctance of victims to admit having
been "bled." All day long the chief of
federal' agents had been besieged by
tearful men and women—most of them
around middle age—begging that they
be not dragged into the scandal.
Despite the situation, involving fam
ily ties and reputations, that Is acting
as a bar to wholesale prosecutions, It
was declared at night conclusive evi
dence had been obtained against at
least three members of the band.
These were named as—Helen Evers,
called the "siren" of the gang Ed
ward "Doc" Donahue and Henry Rus
sell.
In the evening "Jimmy" Christian,
one of those arrested in the spectacular
raid at the Tyson apartments, was re
leased on $2,500 bonds, signed by
British Front in Fiance, Sept. 18, via
London, Sept. 19.—The most dramatic
and picturesque battle of the British
army In all its two years in France
was fought, on Sept. 15. Here is the
story of how all kinds of men from
the ends of the world took part in this
conflict.
In the same dressing station this
week the correspondent of the Asso
ciated Press has seen Canadians, New
Zealanders, English. Scotch, Irish, New
foundlanders. and Americans. These
were some of the men from many
countries who took part In the battle.
In which participated the motor car«s
called "tanks," which are to the credit
of a quiet officer of engineers Wherf
the correspondent met this. offlcer-ln
London six months ago and asked him
what Job he was on, he replied:^
"Sh!-Don't tell."
It was the tank? which completed
the battle. The tank called the "cop
don rouge" took an officer' across the
shell craters,, weaving its way thru the
German lines, up to the door of the
brigadier's dug-out.
The skipper of the "tank" alighted
and with a drawl announced that be
reported for further orders. The brig
adier laughingly asked him not to
f.tart the brute down the stairs of th«?
dug-out but leave It at one aide and
await orders.
It wended its way over more shell
craters, where It would be out of the
way_ .'-50?

the ground which the Canadians had
taken. Later they stormed the village

MARSHALLTOWN, IOWA, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1916.
Charles P. Adomaltts, 3043 Lowe ave
nue, and Harry 1. Goldsmith, 745 North
Clark street. The chopping in two of
Christian's bond from the amount or
iginally fixed was taken as indicative
that the proof tfgainst him was not
strong.
It was also reported that, because of
the serious situation resultant from
the refusal of many victims to testify,
the cases against Mrs. Edward Dona
hue, James Bland and Mrs. Francos
Allen had been considerably weakened.
With the members of the alleged
syndicate behind. t|he county -Jail bars
and with two new arrests in the east,
the federal authorities delved further
into the machinations of the gang and
prepared for the Initial test this morn
ing, when th'« prisoners' preliminary
hearing Is scheduled to take place be
fore Commissioner Foote.
It was known that the government
would rely not only upon the testi
mony of Mrs. Regina S. Klipper, a
Philadelphia widow, who was victim
ised, but also upon confessions of at
least two members of the band, who
have been given immunity for their
testimony.
Mrs. Klipper left Philadelphia yes
terday for Chicago in the company of
government agents. The indictments
pending against the gang are based on
the fleecing of the woman, which oc
curred in New York In January.
The federal authorities will attempt
to haVo the prisoners removed to New
York for trial. While indictments may
be voted here, the eastern case will be
given precedence, although some mem
bers of the syndicate may face prose
cutions here as the result of the dis
covery of opium and smoking "lay
outs" In their possession.

Some had the accent of Missouri,
others that of New England.
"We got into the big show all right,"
said an American, "and that is what
we came here for."
These men who had rushed to attack
the ridges of the Somme against the
machine gun fire and shells carried
themselves in a manner worthy of the
traditions of the civil war. They hal

Hughes and Fairbanks Speak.
Peoria, Sept. 19.—Charles E. Hughes,
opening his second prenldentlal cam
paign trip. In an address here today
characterized the democratic party as
a "party of broken promises which
now presents extravagant claims."
The nominee declared that the claims
by President Wilson were extravagant
and that nothing of the sort had been
accomplished.
"I believe," he said, "that credit
should be given where credit Is due,
but I think It Important that no man
should claim he has done what he has
not done.
"The democratic party promised to
reduce the cost of living. They have
not done it. They promised to pre
vent waste and extravangance. They
have been more extravagant In the last
congress than any preceding congress.
"Our opponents promised to appiy
the principles of the merit system.
They have betrayed the merit system.
"They promised to reduce the use
less office. Instead they have ap
pointed useless officers.
"They promised that the rights of
American citizens should be enforced
thruout the world. They have shame
lessly failed to perform that promise.
"The republican party stands for
constructive policies. First of all we
propo:-e to protect American lives on
land and sea. We have no secret in
trigues. We propose that American
rights shall be treated with respect to
every nation In the world, great or
small."

Dry Campaigners in Nevada.
Reno, Nev., Sept. 19.—Members of the
prohibition coast to coast campaign
party invaded Nevada today. They
passed thru here this morning from
flrs't objective In an uninterrupted
dash, absolutely on time. There was
the trench which the "Byng boys," as
the Canadians are known, held on the
morning of the lath. Behind It and
ahead of it shell craters were so thick
that you could step from one to an
other.
They Wanted More.
Having taking the objective their
Part was finished, but General Byng
decided that he could go farther. Tho
commanders of British corp.* of all
kinds, from cockneys to the clerks,
stock brokers and farm hands of the
r.ew army, made the same decision. S'l
they worked In conjunction, as every
thing In these big movements must be
co-operation and team play.
"Confouhd cos«t and everything else."
said the Canadians. When the word
was given they started for Courcel
lette, which they were ordered to take.
Now this village had been less
crumpled than any yet captured. There
Were some battered rafters of roof still
In position.. That is, Courcellette had
had less hammering by preparatory
shell Hre. To their new objective,
however, went these fighters from the
new wo.rld, Including men from as
far south as New Orleans. They were
determined to get there .and mnke good
and they got there.
Among the men. coming back was a
tall soldier, with high check bones, red
skin, ebony hair and expressionless
feature". He was an American of the
Sloux type.
"The German Is some fighter," said
one Canldlan, "and he has been learn
ing the game for a long time."

Washington. Sept 19.—No ground for
complaint to the Teutonic powers was
found by state department officials in
the summary received today from the
consul at Barcelona of affidavits made
by two American sailors who belonged
to the crew of the Italian bark Stella
del Mare, sunk a fortnight ago off the
Spanish coast. The bark is believed to
have been torpedoed but the statements
of the American seamen are regarded
as too Inconclusive to furnish the basis
for diplomatic inquiry.
Department officials indicated that
the German government probably
would be asked for any Information
available as to the sinking of the
steamer Kelvlnla on which there were
twenty-eight American muleteers. Al
tho official reports have left In doubt
the question as to whether the ship was
torpedoed or struck a mine, some of the
Americans have made affidavit that She
was attacked 'by a submarine without
warning.
Tho ease of the American steamer
Owego Is considered closed with the
explanation from Qermany thai re
sisted an order to stop.
