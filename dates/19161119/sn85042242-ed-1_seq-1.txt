London, Nov. 18.—The British army
delivered another assault on the Ger­
man lines on both banks of the An

Military authorities in Berlin are
quoted as saying that the southwest­

campaign, is to be the scerte of. the
decision in the war, not the Russian
front, nor the front at Verdun, nor on
tho Sommo.
Germans Progressing in Wallachia.
The German troops in western Wal­
lachia are reported by Berlin to be
making good progress and scoring
further gains in the Alt and Juil val­

ant objective on the western Mace­
donian front. Serbians report the
capture of the tredches east of the

SEES PRESIDENT
Washington. Nov. 18.—Henry P.
Davison, a partner of J. P. Morgan,
held a 45-minute conference with Pres
ident Wilson at the White House to­
night. The engagement was made at
Mr. Davison's request. Afterwards he
responded to all questions by saying:
"I have nothing whatever to say
about my visit to Washington."
Mr. Davison's call at the White
House was linked in some quarters
with a report that the' Morgan inter­
ests had helped the National Industrial
Conference board with the purpose of
organizing employers to fight the eight
hour day. Mr. Davison told here that
the story was an absolute fabrication.
BURLEIGH COUNTY BUILT
148 MILES OF NEW ROAD
THIS SEASON—GRAVELING
J. WL Friddle, superintendent of
road-making operations for the Bur­
leigh county commission, has laid up
his equipment for the winter, except­
ing only the new elevating grader,
which has some work to finish this
side of the McKcnzie slough.
Burleigh couhty in 1910 built 148
miles of new country road and re­
dressed 35 to 40 miles of old high­
way. The record for new road-mak­
ing does not compare with that for
1&15, when 172 miles were construct­
ed. It is the general opinion, how­
ever. tfiat better roads have been
built this year. It is also true that
the extreme wetness of spring and
early feummer made it impossible for
the commission to get the heavy
tractors and graders into service un­
til very late. The soil worked this
year, too, wai, the most difficult to be
found in the county, sufficient rock
having been picked from the road­
way 4n the northeast portion of tn«
county to surface, if crashed, every
mile of highway built in that region.
Graveling the county highways will
be the next advanced step taken by
the Burleigh commission, it is pre­
dicted. There probably is not a
stretch of road in the county which
could not be surfaced from pits with­
in a distance of two miles. The cost,
it i% claimed, would not be great, and
the result would be the best general
purpose highways to be found in the
state. Under their present condition,
the turnpikes are excellent in dry
weather, 'but they are the de'il's own
mess in wet.

Wilson To
Rush Labor
Legislation
Washington, Nov. 18.—The first act­
ual steps toward carrying out the re­
mainder of President Wilson's railroad
legislation program, to compel investi­
gation of labor disputes before strikes
can be called, will be taken Monday
when he confers with Representative
Adamson, chairman of the house con­
ference committee, and author of the
eight-hour law. The officials said to­
day the American Federation of Lab­
or's declaration against the president's
plan would not deter him.
MAY WITHDRAW TROOPS.
Washington, No?. 18.—The dead­
lock reached by the joint international
commission in session at Atlantic City
to discuss Mexican border problems
was taken up tonight at a White
House conference between President
.Wilson, Chairman Lane, chairman of

troops will be withdrawn.
HOME FROM CONVENTION.

To-morrowThe Bismarck Tribune will be published as an eveifing
paper, train service out of Bismarck necessitates this change as well
as an insistent, demand from many readers and advertisers.
In order to reach a targe percentage of our mail subscribers upon
the day of publication, it is imperative that we make this change.
All readers best served now^bij the moaning edition will be given
the same-service through a special mail edition carrying the Idtest tel
egraph service.
Bismarck subscribets will be given a paper delivered at their doors
each evening when they have plenty of leisure time to read one.
Under this arrangement, The Tribune can serve its patrons much
better than in the past. Both the Associated and United Press services
have been secured.
This will insure readers up-to-the-minute service on all important
events. They will get the news from twelve to twenty-four hours ahead
of th&Twin City, Grand Forks and Fargo papers.
It is the intention of the management to make The Tribune bigget
and better. More attention will be given to state news, especially State
capital news. A trained newspaper man is kept at the state house each
working day, and during the legislature, better facilities will be provided
for handling the news of the session.
Our state news service will be unexcelled by any in the state. The
last edition will carry a story of every important detail up to adjourn­
ment of the legislative day, and readers in our immediate*vicinity will
yet the NEWS on the SAME I)AY it'happens, not twelve to twenty-four
hours after.
Just a word as to policy:
The Tribune will continue to be, as it has been for the last thirty-six
years a consistent supporter of the principles of the Republican party.
'1 hi its news columns, however, it proposes to be strictly independent
ond non-partisan. The readers are entitled to the news untainted by
partisanism. ..w: ....
"tnt hetfl
is to convene soon. The Trwune proposes to tell the story just
as it happens. Farmers can depend upon the reports being reliable
and fidr^-t* f\t *\i*'
In addition to the press service mentioned, The Tribune will con
tittup to carry the Newspaper Enterprise features which have proved
so popular. These will ada "pep" and ginger to the news columns.
Itou cannot afford to be without The Tribune this winter with BIG
NEWS breaking at the STATE CAPITAL.

CAN'T MM HIGH
COST ON EARNERS
Chicago, Nov. 18.—Chicago grain
men and students of crop conditions
here today contradicted a charge made
by Joseph Hartigan, commissioner of
weights and measure? in New York
that westtern farmers had under esti­
mated their crop reports to the fed­
eral government and forced up the
price of foodstuffs.
"The attack of Mr. Hartigan on the
honesty of the American farmer and
the reliability of the American crop
reporting system is just about as far
from the truth of the situation as his
statement a few weeks ago that the
Board of Trade had bought up all the
wheat in the country and were making
the high cost to the consumer," said
George P. Griffins, president of the
Chicago Board of Trade.
"Both statements show that the
gentleman has not studied- the crop
conditions to any degreo worthy of
consideration."
Millard R. Meyers, editor of the
American Co-operative Journal, official
publication for a number of farmers'
organizations, also criticised the state­
ment of Mr. Hartigan.
"It is absurd and preposterous to
say that there is any concerted action
among farmers either honest or dis­
honest that governs the movement of
their grains or making up the crop re­
ports."
LAST MEETING OF BOARD.
The last stated meeting of the pres­
ent Burleigh county-board will be held

Indianapolis, Nov. 18.—William J.
Bryan, former secretary of state, at a
conference with delegates to the Na­
tional Woman's Christian Temperance
Union here today, advised the women
to "do everything possible to stimu­
late rivalry between the democratic
and republican parties in the cause of
prohibition."
The present fashions in women's
dress were condemned by Mrs. Lumv
da B. Smith, of Ottawa, Kan. She
said.
"Cry aloud against the immodest
dress of women and girls. The time
is here that one cannot tell by the
dress of women the pure women from
the courtesan, so flagrantly immodest
has the fashion of dress become."
WOLF PELTS BEGIN TOl
COME OT—FEW MAKING
FORTUNE FROM BOUNTY
Wolf pelts are 'beginning to arrive
more frequently at the county audi­
tor's office, as winter approaches and
the farmers find more time to go after
the "varmints." The champion boon
ty-winner of the past week was Jacob
Holwagner of Arena, who brought in
six pelts, for which he received $15 In
warrants. C. A. Stillwell of Boldwin
also brought in one hide. Since Jane

asked by the accused man to delay the
coroner's inquest, and then when he
had determined upon it, had been ask­
ed by Mr. McDaniel to declare to the
newspapers that it had been requested
by the prosecutor. The most damag­
ing testimony given by Dr. Cox, as
viewed by the prosecution, was his
statement that the blows which killed
Mrs. McDaniel were struck three-quar­
ters of an hour before McDaniel called
for a police surgeon to attend Mrs.
McDaniel.

Oscar Heitman, a bachelor, living If
mile.s southeast of this village, placed
