from the American Federation of
Labor late today that all class fuel

fails to work for thlH end la quali
fied to cult himself a true Amort
can. The delegation comprised the mem
bership of the federation's annual
convention, which has been meeting
In Maltimnrc. The delegates came
to Washington on Hpeclal cars and
marched tu the Whito House headed
by a band to congratulate the presi
dent on his re-election. Samuel
Gompers. president of the federation.
Beted us their spokesman, declaring
laboring people hacl come to rccng
nlzo that Mr. Wilson stands for Jus

have taken Joy In upholding your
hands In your great work," said Mr.
Gompers. "I need not say that com

errand I am deeply gratified and
very greatly cheered." Bald the presi
dent in reply.
"It would be impossible for me
offhanded to nay Just whut thoughts
are stirred me by what Mr. (lorn

man, but perhaps the simplest thinij
I can say is. after all, the meat of
tho whole matter. What 1 have
tried to do is to get rid of any class
divlMlon in this country, not only that
but of any class conscientiousness
and feeling. The worst thing that
could happen to America would bo
that she should be divided into
groups and camps In which there
were men and women who thought
that they were at odds with one an
other, that the spirit of America was
not expressed except in them and
that possibilities of antagonism were
the only things that we had to look
forward to.

from Tulsa to match inch a record.
However, with such unprecedented
team spirit as was shown Friday night
at lb- opening it does look as if the
Tuls.i campaign organization will take
advantage of the oppottunity to out
class all cities of its size in two par
llciilai features, civic uiirit and pe
riod of ttiue, to c.unplete the task.
"I have never started a campaign
where the public was iu well In
formed and apparently so well pre
pared to respond. This in itself is a
record, however, ti e Tulscns may not
regard it As a big one. The press Is
birgelv responsible for this co-operating

save the taxpayers a flat $20,000 in so
doing.
I'oimer Mayor Frank M. Wooden,
who is a prominent real estate dealer
and builder, made the offer to Mayor
Simmons in 1111 Informal way, bill the
pi ..position will be put up to the ex
ecutive and the board of commission
ers tomorrow- in concrete form.
The piopirty Is 70x90 feet 111 dimen
sions. It is located In the very heart
of the city, with the new fedelal h Hid
ing and the Elks' club one block north
and 'he courthouse two blocks south.
A more ideal location for a city hall
could ir.l be had at any price. If
the sale is 111 ide the church will use
the inoijoy toward erecting a costly
111 w edifice in another section o the
I'M y.
Has llccn Investigated.
Architects have gone over the
church struct. ire thoroughly and have
arrived at the coi.clusioi that witn
the expenditure of a very small sun:
of motley the building can be reeon
stiucleil, enlarged and faced whh
stone and otherwise ma.le Into tne
best illy ban in the stale and one of
tin preltieM and most practical pub
lic blllldlllKs III Hie city.
The propi ity, outside of, the Im
provements, Is worth $2',. inn 1, figuring
on a basis of values 111 that neighhor
haad. This would l.t givi.ig the build
ing to the cit for $.000.
(ill account of the many advanta
geous features of the proposition, il
is not thought likely the mayor and
commissioners will spin 11 the offer, as
It is by far the best deal that has been
offered them since they began nego
tiating for a city h ill sit.-.

And kci p in niiinl that you will jM the ln-st values aihl
the host treatment hy patronizing legitimate Tulsa merchants.
Hearing of Tulsa's prosperity a whole Hock of peilillors
n ml itinerant men-hunts have descended upon Tulsa, hopeful
of "making a clcmiing" dunn"; the Chrismias holidays. The
city is flooded with them.
It is hoth dangerous and disloyal to patronize this class
of people, l-'cw, if any, of them transact a legitimate Inisi
iiess. They are here tod.fy and gone tomorrow. They make
a business of dumping a lot of cheap goods on the market
at exorbitant prices. When you buy o! Tulsa merchants
you aro patronizing home industry and dealing with people
who will bo here six months or six yyars from now to make
good any error or satisfy any dissatisfied customer.
Recently The World lias refused to accept advertising
from many of this class of dealers, believing that it is neither
fair to the public or merchants of Tulsa to encourage such
buncombe) methods of business.
Do your share, Mr. and Mrs. Shopper, by keeping
money fit home and thereby protect yourself and the
manent legitimate Tulsa business man.
