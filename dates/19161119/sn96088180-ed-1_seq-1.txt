committee on Interstate commerce,
ai to the completion, of the program
he advanced at the last session of
congress. Adamson (aye Ihla pro
iraro will be pushed through . Im
mediately when eonR-reaa reconvene!
In December and that It may be
found Inadvisable even to await the
' report of the Joint congressional com
mittee, authorised to make a search
ing Inquiry Into the entire railroad
problem.
With the railroads a unit combat
tins; the conalltuUonallty of the eight
hour law, with labor ready-to fight
proposals for settlement of Industrial
dleputcs by legislation, and wlth
members of congress widely divided
on these questions, the railroad prob
lem threatens to seriously embarrass
the smooth operation of the legisla
tive machinery at this seulon.
There are as yet four proposals In
the president's program of strike
aettlement and prevention to be act
ed upon If he holds to his original
program. These Include:
Provision -for enlargement and re
organisation of the Interstate com
merce commission; approval by con
greea of consideration by the. Inter
state commerce commission of In
creases, when ' Justified, In freight
retea to meet such additional ex
penditure rendered necessary by
adoption ot the eight-hour day; an
amendment of the existing federal
statute which provldea for mediation,
conciliation and arbitration of In
dustrial controversies by adding a
provision that In case present
agencies fall, a full public Investi
gation of the merits ot every such die
, pute shall be Instituted and complet
ed before a strike' or lockout may be
lawfully attempted.'
Giving the president power, In case
of military necessity, to take control
of auoh rolling stork ot the railroads
as may be required for military use
and granting Mm authority to draft
Into military aervlct such train crews
and administrative officials a cir
cumstances require, -
The president also is expected to
1 urge In his message that nil arbitral
awards be made Judgments by record
of a court "In order that their Inter
pretation and enforcement may He,
itot with one party to the arbitration,
tout with -an authoritative and Im
partial tribunal."

hondon, Nov. England Is to
day seeking some means of reprisal
against Germany for enslavement"
of Belgium's able bodied men. Not
since the execution of Miss Care II
baa there been such a wave of pop
ular Indignation as that which la
sweeping over the country as fresh
details of the Teutonic plan ot giv
ing employment to the Belgian civil
ian population by deporting there to
Germany, are received.
. It la realised that with the United
States rests the only hope of inter
cession to prevent a clean aweep from
the desolate nation of all Ita man
hood. Stories of fathera and aona
parted forcibly from their wives and
mothers and other loved onea by Ger
man soldiery have served to fan It In
to a fever-heat.
Three hundred thousand male Bel
gians above the age ot If are affected
by the employment orders from Ber
lin. So far at least 45,000 ot these
have been transported from their
homes to Oermany, that they may be
given employment, according to tu
German explanation. The transfers
Ire taking place at the rate of two
thousand a day.
Information today, received via
Holland asserts pleas avail nothing
and that in some Instances, where
those Pleas were more then usually
forcible, Oerman commanders enforc
ed their orders and In addition Ira
posed further tax burdens as an ex
ample to those who opposed the mili
tary machine. The town of Tournal,
It waa alleged, had been fined 150,
000 tor' "arrogance without prece
dent," In thus opposing the employ
ment orders. .
Copies ot the notice to Belgians
requiring their assembly at certain
concentration points for this, weeding
out ot able bodied workmen have
been received In Holland.

Tne tamoua Greenback mine, a
gold-producing property that baa add
ed two and one-half millions ot dol
lars to the wealth of the country, but
which for the past eight years baa
been lying Idle, la again to take Ita
proper place In the Industrial devel
opment of the district It haa lately
passed Into the hands ot a company
of people from Buffalo, New York,
and the work of placing it in shape
for operation Is now in progress.
Messrs. W. L. Baker' and H. L.
Holmes, of Buffalo, are here repre
senting the new owners of the Green
back, aad expect to have the atampa

1 The Greenback mine la a free
milling property located on Grave
creek, 11 miles from Grant Pass.
and about two miles north of Placer.
It la equipped with a 40- tamp mill
and with other machinery and build
logs 'In proportion. It waa operated
upon a moat extensive scale for about
eight years, and waa one ot the best
known and most valuable producers
of the coast country. There is about
three miles of Underground workings
In the property, and It Is equipped
with steam, water and electric power.
The discovery of the Greenback by
prospectors was followed by Ita aale
to eastern people for $80,000, though
the original discoverers took consid
erable gold from It right from the
surface. It la a mine that developed
Itself, and beside paying for Ita mag
nificent equipment as It went paid
heavy dividends during the period ot
Us operation. Difficulties arising in
its operation eight years ago caused
Ita closing down, since which time It
haa been idle. The new owners will
not put the entire 40 stamps Into
operation at this time, atartlng only
10 of them now. A full crew bt men
will be employed, however, aad the
ore body will be opened up as mat as
la possible, and with 10 atampa fall
ing within the next 10 days the gold
output of Josephine county should
be very largely augmented.
