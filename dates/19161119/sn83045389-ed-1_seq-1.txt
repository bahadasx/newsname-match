Thr attention of the Oovertior is
(Iireeled to the' waste involved in the
printing of voluminoiiH annual reports
padded with material that is of little
or no practical value.
"Notable in this connection." the
committee finds, "is the annual report
of the State Librarian, who for some!
time has I injecting into the report '
required of him by law. a list of books I
received into the library, disquisitions
on the growth of llie library, and simi
lar statements, creating unnecessary
exp.-nse. it has been the custom for
the superintendent of schools to in
corporate Into his annual report the
statements of schools and colleges over
which he has no control, and for wliyse
conduct he is not responsible. Tip*
matter complained of in the library, if
printed, should be contained in bulle
tins and not subject the State to the
cost of carrying it in annual report.
"Annual reports should. in our
opinion, be confined to matter of value
to the <JeneraI Assembly in considering
recommendations for legislation, and
to facts about the work of the depart
ment. The object of an annual report
should be to set forth facts such as
will give an accurate idea of the work
of the department for which it is writ
ten. without presenting a mass of con
fusing details, statistics, scientific or
technical detail. Under our system as i
at present controlled we have waste
both in printing and distribution.

The crowd was slow m filing into

wli'-n the otlicials gathered in tin- cen

the amount of rooting during the early j

thought professionals were playing, or I
that the stands were tilled with unites, j
Turne: Methel is a Richmond hoy, and,
was playing with Washington and Lee
yesterday, but outside of him there!
was none of the players well known |
t,i local patrons of the game. The 1

>oine urn.- and their work has been I
watched closely because they are known!
t>> have a sterling aggregation.
I tut the organized rooting that one'
associates with a football contest was j
la -king yesterday. It was due in parti
to the fact thai both elevens mac- !
tlcally were playing away from home, j
anil were without the assistance <>f ;
.heir organized rooting corps. How-I
ever, the principal reason was that the I
fans had gathered at the park lo sec I
real football, and not because of par-!
tisan interests. They saw their foot-]
hall g a me, and. during the latter pari j
of the bat11'-. several lin es aecordded!
players of the elevens praise for their!
work. Most of this applause, however.]
was given Washington and Lee. when
iis men several times fought back t!io
savace attacks of their opponents.
Tlo re was nothing lo mar the sport
yesterday. The weather was just
crisp enough lo make the players com
fortable and still not ion -ool t i ratine

Also there was no mail rush for the
nether side of the grand stand at the
end of the lirs: half. In former days,
provided those' days were as chilly as
yesterday, there was a gem ral exodus
of the male gender, and bottles, from

The President said that nothinc
worse con 1.1 happen to this country
than f--i the people to imagine they
wore at odds with one another, and
concluded with an exhortation t?> all ;
to join in tho "common movement for'
i
lut man it y.
Following Is tho text or tho Presl- |
dent's address:
"Mr. Gompers, l.adies and Gentlemen:
"l need not say that, ???'mint; to me
as you do on such an errand. I tin very i
deeply gralltled and very greatly 1
cheerod. It would ho impossible f??r j
me off-hand to say just what thoughts!
are stirred in me l?y what Mr. Gompers
has said (? ? me as ymir spokesman,
hut perhaps the simplest thing I can
say is, after all. tho meat of she whole
matter. What I have tried to do is to j
pet rid of any class division in this
country not only, but of any claps con
sciousness anil fooling.
"The worst thing that could hap-j
pen to America would he that she I
should be divided into groups and
camps in which there were men audi
women who thought that tliey were ;
at odds with one another, that the
spirit of America was not expressed ex-1
? ?opt in them, and that posslhllitbv of
antagonism wore the only things that
we had to loo'K forward to.
\\ IMS TO ? Iti: \TI-: I MT\
or SI'IUIT AMI PI UPOSI-:
"As Mr Gompers said, achievement is
,i comparatively small matter, but the
spirit in which things arc done is of
the essence of the whole thing, and
what 1 am striving for, and what I hope
you are striving for, is to blot out all
the lines of division in America, and
create a unity of spiiit and of pur
pose founded upon this, the conscious
ness that we are all men and women
? ?I* the same sort, and that if we d<>
not understand each other, we are n<*t
true Americans. If we cannot enter
into each other's thoughts. if we can
not comprehend each other's interests,
if we cannot serve each other's es
sential welfare, then we have not yet
qualified as representatives of the
American spirit.
"Nothing alarms America so much as
rifts, divisions, the drifting apart of
dements among her people, and the
thin:* we ought all t>> strive for is to
close up every rift, and tin- only way I
to do it. so far as I can see. is to r~-'
tahlish justice not only, hut justice]
with a heart in it, justice with a pulse
in it, justice with sympathy in it. Jus
tice can be rold aiii*. Vorbidding, or it
can l?e warm and welcome, an I the
latter is the only kind of Justice that
Americans otiuht to desire.
"I do not believe I am deceiving my
self when I say that I think Ill's spirit
Is growing iti America. I pray God
it may ? ultimo- to grow. and all 1
have to say is to exhort every one
whom iu\ voice reaches here or elso
