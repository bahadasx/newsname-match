NUMBER 68
TIGERS BEAT DRAKE
II UBNttLF, 14-0
With Five Substitutes, Mis
sourians in First Part Hold
the Bulldogs Scoreless.
RIDER IN 50-YARD RUN
Collins Plays Well Iowans
Complete Ten Forward
Passes in 15 Attempts.
Missouri still has a pretty good
football team, and Drake knows how
lo work the forward pass these were
the outstanding features of the 14-to-
0 victory of the Tigers over the vis
itors from Iowa on Rollins Field yes
terday afternoon. With five substi
tutes in the line-up, the Missourians
played their opponents to a standstill
In the first half. With the regular Ti
ger backfleld in action in the second
half, two touchdowns came in rapid
succession. Lansing kicked both goals.
Drake worked ten forward passes out
of fifteen attempts and succeeded in
scooping In several the Tigers tried,
t one touchdown was fairly earned,
.coming when the team worked the
ball from the center of the gridiron
down to the Drake goal line and then
put Collins over. The other resulted
from a pretty run by Rider for half
the length of the field.
Drake Works Forward Pass.
The Bulldogs, by mixing short side
passes off the ends with longer passes
over the line, completely baffled the
Tiger defense. Smith, the plunging
Drake fullback, was also able to
pierce the Tiger defense at times, but
poor interference on end runs, coupled
with fumbles and penalties, lost more
ground for the Iowa team than the'
passes and line plays could make up.
At least three times during the
game the eleven from the North
threatened to score, but each time
luck bfoke against them. In the sec
ond quarter they worked the ball to
within kicking distance of the Mis
souri goal, but they chose to try a
forward pass, which missed connec
tions by a narrow margin. Smith
took the kickoff off the goal posts
after Missouri's first touchdown and
tore down the side of the field, elud
ing practically the whole Tiger team,
but Rider luckily a track man cut
across the field after him and saved
the day by a pretty tackle. Later in
the game Drake's passes put the ball
on Missouri's 13-yard line, but a fum
ble cost the Iowans the chance to
score.
Tiger Coaches Save Plays.
The Missouri coaches were obvious
ly saving their best men and plays
for the Kansas game, and no attempt
was made to run up a score. Morris,
White and Collins worked in the back
field during the first half, but were
unable to take advantage of the su
perior Tiger line and could only hold
the Bulldogs to a draw. Rider and
McMillan went in with Collins in the
third quarter and had little trouble
gaining ground against the fighting
Iowans. After the two touchdowns
other backfleld men got a chance to
work out, and they continued to hold
the advantage.
The Tigers outrushed their oppon
ents, gaining 313 yards by straight
football to Drake's 55 yards. The
punts were practically even, both
Blusher and Jernegan averaging close
to 36 yards. Drake gained 94 yards by
the aerial route, while not a Tiger
pass went true. Missouri made six
teen first downs to Drake's eight Mis
souri lost 60 yards by penalties, while
Drake was penalized only 30 yards.
Tiger Line Holds Its Own.
The Tiger line, broken up as it was,
consistently outcharged the Drake
forwards. Even the great Sprong was
Played to a standstill by Hamilton,
who later proved his ability at tackle
both by carrying the ball and checking
Drake plays. Preston, McAnaw and
Groves put up their usual aggressive
Eames. Bass proved a demon at end,
time after time throwing the Drake
runners for big losses.
The first half was a punting duel
with the advantage slightly to Jerne
ttn, the Drake halfback. Neither team
could gain consistently, and most of
toe playing was between the 25-yard
"nes. , Missouri's backfleld made
three first downs in the first quarter,
making up for Jernegan's advantage
In the booting, but Urake opened up
In the second quarter, completing sev

Kansas Defeats Nebraska and
Further Complicates
Valley Race.
The Kansas Jayhawkers staged
their much-talked-of comeback yes
terday by giving Nebraska her first
Conference defeat since 1910 when a
touchdown in the third quarter forced
the Cornhuskers to take the short end
of a 7-to-3 score after they had led,
3 to 0, In the first half through a field
goal by Captain Corey.
The victory of the Jayhawkers fur
ther complicates matters in the" Mis
souri Valley Conference, for it is now
impossible for any team to have a
clear title to the championship. Ev
ery team in the conference has lost a
game to some other conference team.
The game yesterday not only mark
ed Kansas' first victory over Nebras
ka for some time but gave them their
first touchdown of the season against
a conference team. The Jayhawkers
now have a record of one game won
and one lost in the conference with a
tie with the Kansas Aggiqs also on
their sheet. Kansas lost to Ames, 13
0. The Conference title Is now a mat
ter of "dope." If the Tigers beat
Kansas Thanksgiving Day Missouri
will be tied with Nebraska in games
won and lost, each with three won and
one lost If Kansas wins Nebraska
will lead in games won and lost" but
the Jayhawkers will have as good a
claim to the title as the Cornhuskers,
while the Kansas Aggies, by virtue of
their victory over Missouri and Ames
by virtue of her victory over Kansas,
could also put in claims to the honor.
MOTHERS CLUB MAKES $4X50.
Bazar at the Benton School Well Pat
ronized Yesterday.
The proceeds of the second annual
Benton School Mothers' Bazar held
yesterday was $43.50. The money will
be uaed by the Benton School for im
proving and increasing the equipment
of the domestic, science and manual
training departments; purchasing
playground apparatus, and in assist
ing needy children through school.
Fancy aprons, handkerchiefs, tow
els, hand bags, center-pieces and other
articles, both serviceable and orna
mental had been contributed by the
mothers of the children of the school.
There were also useful articles given
by the teachers, themselves, and a few
outside friends of the school. Buying
was brisk throughout the day. The
15-cent luncheon served at noon was
well patronized by the business men.
"We are very well pleased with the
results of today's bazar," said Mrs. T.
E. Windsor, president of the Benton
Mothers' Association," and we are ex
ceedingly grateful to Mr. Stone for the
use of his building, which has been a
most important factor in the success
of our undertaking."
According to Mrs. C. E. Coombe,
treasurer of the association, the re
ceipts of last year's bazar were not
equal to the amount taken in this
year and on that account the associa
tion should be able to do even more
good the coming year than it has done
during the past twelve months.

PRESIDENT IN FIGHT
OVER ADioON LAW
Wilson to Offer Proposal for
Prevention of Strikes in
the United States.
TO GO TO CONGRESS
Program Is Planned to Be
Put Through in Coming
Final Joint Session.
ny United Press
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 President
Wilson today was preparing personal
ly to enter the great three-cornered
fight among labor, railroads and the
goernment with a proposal for the
prevention of strikes In the United
States. Monday he will confer with
Representative Adamson, chairman of
the House Committee on Interstate
Commerce, concerning the program
he advanced at the last joint session
of Congress.
Mr. Adamson says this program will
be pushed through immediately when
Congress reconvenes in December, and
he says it may be found not advisable
to await the report of Congress' Joint
committee authorized to make an en
quiry into the entire railroad prob
lem. With the railroads as a unit com
bating the consttuUonallty of the
eight-hour law, with labor ready to
fight proposals of settlement, with
members of Congress widely divided
on these questions, the.railroad prob
lem threatens to embarrass the Bmooth
operation of the legislative magilnery
of this session. V
T. A. DAVIS DODGES PUBLICITY
Accusation of Being Student Irks
Speaker at Shoe Factory.
The first of a series of noon-day
talks at the Hamilton-Brown Shoe
Factory was given yesterdayby Vin
cent A. Davis, a student in kthe Uni
versity, on "The Other Fellow." A
large part of the time allotXedtttthe
speaker was spent in telling of ihe"
"handicap" under which he spoke,
criticising the Daily Missourian for
referring to him in Friday's paper as a
student in the University.
Mr. Davis is a junior in the School
of Education of the University and
lives at 806 Missouri aicnue. His
home is at Independence, Mo.
At the beginning of his speech Mr.
Davis told his hearers, about seventy-
five employes of the shoe factory, that
he w as speaking under two severe dis
advantages. One was that he was un
accustomed to speaking in the open
air; the other was that the Missourian
had said he was a student in the Uni
versity.
"If the writer of that story in yes
terday's Missourian had tried for five
hundred years, he could never have
framed up a more misleading impres
sion," said Mr. Davis, in opening his
address. "And while "i am a student
in the University, nevertheless I am
afraid the laborer will think I am the
usual sappy kind he is so used to hear
ing." After the address Mr. Davis asked a
reporter for the Missourian not to
publish what he had said about the
paper to those assembled at the meet
ing. He said to the reporter that he
was a student, but did not want the
Hamilton-Brown employes to know it
"If I had known a Missourian reporter
was in the crowd, I would probably
not have made the criticism," he said
when he was introduced to the news
paper man.
A committee was appointed at the
factory to arrange for the continuance
of the series of noon-day talks.
OTHER TOWNS WAST FILMS
Women's Clnbs of Nearbv Towns
Would Form Educational Circuit.
The series of educational films that
are being shown under the auspices of
a number of women's clubs of Colum
bia have attracted such favorable at
tention that similar organizations In
Sedalia, Hannibal, Moberly and Boon-
viile have written to those in charge
here to see if some circuit could be
arranged whereby these films might
be shown in those cities. If such a
circuit is completed it means that Co
lumbia will get to see better pictures
at the same prices.
The second of the series of thirteen
was shown to a crowd of 700 yester
day afternoon. Last Saturday the
number reached almost a thousand
but the fotball game attracted many
who otherwise would have been there.
The program consisted of a visualiza
tion of Daniel Defoe's "Robinson Cru
soe" and a picture of the same series
as the one shown last Saturday.

MAY RIDDLE AN ALIB
State Hopes to Prove a Mo
tive for the Accused St.
Joseph Prosecutor.
By United Press
ST. JOSEPH, Nov. 18. That the at
tempted alibi on behalf of Oscar Mc
Danlel, charged with the murder of
his wife July 14, will be riddled by the
state was the statement made by At-
.General Barker in opening the
ay. The state will attempt to
McDaniel had
a motive,
tqpt -yreams of his wife were
hl&rd (pothers, that McDaniel was
not'presapt at the places he asserts he
visited thefjiight of the murder and
that he carefully planned the assault
and prepared his defense on the day of
the murder.
For the deense, Judge Strop said a
complete alibi would be presented to
establish the good character of the de
fendant At the opening of the court,
the state asked a delay of halt an
hour, ater which the jury was an
nounced. The state spent thirty-six
hours eliminating the names of twenty-six
veniremen. All except two of

A hush came over the court as two
sad-faced, little women entered and
took seats near Bart M. Lockwood,
special prosecuting attorney. They
were Mrs. L. H. Moss and Miss Allene
Moss, mother and sister of the mur
dered woman. The court room was
packed to capacity early.
HURT IN MOTOR SPILL
Two Women and One Man
Injured in Accident on
Ashland Gravel.
Three persons were injured at 10:30
o'clock last night when a new Stude-
baker automobile driven by Lawrence
Bowser struck a tree on the Ashland
gravel about six miles southeast of
Columbia. The injured are: Mrs.
Lawrence Bowser, knee wrenched;
Miss Flora Stapleton, hand cut; a
man named Nichols, three ribs broken,
hip bruised, hand cut Mr. Bowser
was uninjured. Dr. J. E. Thornton
dressed the wounds.
Lack of familiarity with the new car
is thought to have been responsible
for the accident It is said Mr. Bow
ser lost control of the machine. A car
was sent from Columbia to bring the
injured passengers to town. Mr.
Bowser is proprietor of the Bowser
Taxicab Company.
DAIRYME5 RAISE PRICE 0E MILK
Local Increase Is Dae to High Cost of
Bran and Chops.
Columbia dairymen have advanced
the price of milk. Most of them are
now selling a pint for 5 cents, a quart
for 9 cents and a gallon for 32 cents,
although some of them charge 5 1-2
cents and 10 cents for pints and
quarts. The increase In the price of
chops and 'bran, which are the main
milk-producing feeds, is given as the
cause. Dairymen point out that last
November they bought chops at JL40
and bran at JL10 a hundred, while
now they pay $2 and $1.60 for the
same feeds, a cost increase greater
than the advance in the price of milk.

WITH THE CANADIAN FORCES
ON THE SOMME FRONT, Nov. 18.
Eight minutes of dashing across a sea
of mud, worse than the slough of de
spond, of methodically advancing with
quick work in the trenches, enabled
the Canadians to take the Reglna
trench, one of the smoothest bits of
trench-taking work on the Somme
drive.
I saw Canadians, muddy to the eye
brows, but grinning as they told of
the assault that was over In eight
minutes. The attack was carried out
in a glaring moonlight, and despite
the terrific counter attack by the Ger
mans and a sea of mud, every objec
tive of the Canadian assault was com
pletely won. Though the Germans
repeatedly counter-attacked the Ca
nadians kept every inch of ground and
before dawn had strongly reorganized
positions and dug 250 yards of con
necting trenches.
Prior to the attack the Canadians
had occupied positions directly south.,
of Pys. The Reglna trench, 300 to
500 yards north, had been partly oc
cupied a fortnight ago by the Cana
dians, but a thousand-yard stretch re
mained to be taken. Severe fighting
had (already marked this scene, near
the Regina trench being the Ger
mans' greatest defense work.
