HELEN KELLER'S
ROMANCE FADES
Abandons Plan to Wed
Her Secretary for Sake
of Her Teacher
;. j Teiaaraph t_ Ttir. XMB-M I
Boston. Nov. 18. Helen Keller, the j
famous deaf. dumb and blind girl, has
! abandoned a matrimonial career for
, the sake of the woman who has en
i abled her to learn tfl talk and offset
' her innate infirmities. Mrs. John A.
MacV.
Miss Keller waa engaged to Peter.
i Fagan. a socialist, who became ac
; ouainted with her while a reporter for
a Boston newspaper and waa employed
; by her as secretarv. But romance
I came Into her life. much against the
wishes of her mentor. Mrs. Macy, upon
: whom she is absolutely dependent for
: communication with the world, for de
; velopment of her powers of eixr-ch and
observation and to whom she ia in
.Iri.t.d practically for her life.
Mrs. Macy's opposition to her pupil's
marriace was based r.ot upon selnsh
ness but on realization that it would
hinder the further development of a
marvcllous girl. and ao the romance has
booa ahattered. Mr- Kagan sailed to
t:ii:ht for Tampa Flu.. with another de
nial added to the many made by him?
self and Mrs. Macy durinc the day that
ih**re had been any romance at all. He,
too, naiized that it was best for his
lover's destiny that all thoughta <f
, marriage be i.bandoned.
The fact of the matter is, however,
that about a week ago Mr. Fagan took
: into his confidence the editor of a
' Boston newspaper by which he had been
employed and for which Mrs. Macy'e
i husband had been literary editor. He
J told the editor that he and hia em?
ployer were madly in love with each
' other and that thev desired to be mar?
ried in secret. They planned a literary
carcer nnd Miss Keller was to abandon
tha lecture field, in which Mra. Mary
was her necessary interpreter.
Mrs. Mary had made known her op
poaitiofl to thiir romance and they
. | to be married in secret and
aurpriaa her. hoping th"t she would be
won Vtmt to the laei itahle. They
thought that tl.e marriage must be
without her knowledge or not at all.

WILSON URGES
END OF CLASS
WAR IN U. S.
Tells Gompers and a
Delegation He Aims
to "Close Rifts"
WILL FIGHT FOR
HIS R. R. BILLS
Labor May Uiiitc to Op
pose tmployers on
8-Hour Issue
t From a SUfT r>??T'?>rf'n' flf Tha Trlhuna t
Washington, N'ov. IS. Organized
labor, represented by four hundred
delegates of the American rederaton
of Lahor, heard I'resident Wilson do
clare to-day the policy that he intendi
to pursue to "close up the rifts"
among the elcments of the American
people.
Cffirials at the capital and even the
most casual among his listeners did
r.ot fail to interpret his remarks in the
light of the approaehing railroad con?
troversy and other indieations of pre?
paredness on the part of employes and
employers for a possible struggle be?
tween them In the future.
"Nothing alarms America so much,"
sanl the I'resident in his brief talk to
the Federation delegates in the Last
Loom of the White House, "as rifts,
divisiona, the drifting apart of ele
ments among her peop'.e, and the
thing we ought all to strive for is to
close up every rift, and the only way
to do it, so far as I can see, is to estab
? ish not only ju-tice, but justice with
a heart in it. justice with a pulse in
it, justice with nympathy in it."
"Justice can be cold and forbidding,"
he added, "or it can be warm and wel?
come, and the latter la the only kind
of justice that Americans ought lo
desire. I do not believe I am deceiving
myself when I say that I think this
spirit is growing In America. I pray
God it may continue to grow, and all
T have to say is to exhort every one
whom my voice rearhes hera or elie
where to come into this common move?
ment of humanity."
Frealdent Rreaka Rule
The Federation delegates and their
friends came over to Washington from
Baltimore, where they are holding their
annual convention and marched up to
the White House in parade fashion. It
might have been just an informal re?
ception, but the I'resident seemingly
regarded the meeting as important
enough to break a fast rule against
receiving visitors on Saturday after?
noon-- usually his holiday. Hut he did
not hesitate when Sarnuel Gompers,
pre?ident of the Federation, arranged
for the vlr?it a day or two ago.
The President expects opposition
from the Federation when he attempts
to g4>t Congress to pbss the rest of his
railroad legialative programme, which
went to the boards when the Adamson
law was enar'ed, but no direct mention
wa* made of that la his speech. He aim
ply replied to Mr. Gompers's eulogiums
and then outlmed his hopes "to blot
out all lines of division in America and
create a unity of ispint and of pur?
pose."
For, he said, he had tried to get rid
not only of any "class division" in this
rr.untry, but of any "class consclous
ness and feeling."
Mr. Gompers had said that the dele?
gates came to pay their renpects indi
vidually and collectively to Mr. Wilson
U a man and as I'resident of the I'nited
States. Ihe Federation, ht- stated, is a
wage-earner*.' movement to "bring the
light into the lives of workers." The
uphft of the workers, he said, means
the uplift of the whole country.
IMedgra Labor'a ( onfidence
"Our movement," he said, "stands for

GERMANY READY
TO GIVE EACTS
Berlin Hints Deportations
at Some Points May Have
Been Too Harsh
Berlin, Nov. 11 fvia London, Nov.
18.. Deportations of workmen from
Belgium have been made the subject of
eareful study by Joseph C. Grew,
Charge d'Affaires of the I'nited Btfltflfl
Embaaay here, from the time the first
reports were received of the intention
of the German administration to apply
compulsion to unwilling workers in thc
occupied districts.
Mr. Grew has been collceHng infor?
mation on the subject from various
sources, and roeeatly has taken occa?
sion to discuss the matter lnformaliy
and unofTicially with the higher Ger?
man ofticials to get material in shape
for a conference which hc hupes soon
to have with Dr. von Bethmann-Holl?
weg, the Imperial Chancellor.
Requires Heli. ale Handllng
The lubjeet is an extremely delicate
one diplomatically, and it requires
adept liandling, since not the Cnited
States, but Spain. is entru.ted formally
with the protection of Belgian inter?
ests. But the prominent part taken by
the Gniu-d States in the question of
Belgian relief will, it is believed, as in
the questions affecting Poland, lead the
German government to show an under
.tanding of the interest the Ameriean
government is displaying in this ques?
tion.
The chief critieism of the German
plan seema to Ho not against the gen?
eral idea of providing work, even com
pulsorily, for Idle hands but against
certain aspects of the enforcement of
the general scheme, notably the appar
cntly unsystcmalic rnanner of selecting
and assembling the men for transfer
to Germany, <i;.-regarding in some in
fitances the question whether they al?
ready are employed in Belgium or do
not belong to the labor classes. Mr.
Grew probably will see the Imperiul
Chancellor in the course of the next
few days.
Will Give All Facts
The German government, according
to authoritative statements, will not
hesitate to give the Washington gov?
ernment the desired information re?
garding the Belgian workmen.
The German Foreign Office under
stands that the Ameriean step was
evoked by various reports circulatlng
abroad regarding German action in
Belgium, and by a desire to have au
thentic information regarding the
measures to be taken in case such re?
ports should threaten to interfcre with
tha execution of Belgian relief work
and the collection of funds in the Unit?
ed States.

SUGAR CARDS IN PARIS
I'sed ln Suburb of Neuilly; City to
Ha*.e 'Tirketa" Soon
(Br Cable to Tha Trlt __? 1
Paris, Nov. 18. The first food cards
have appeared in Paris in the form of
sugar cards, issued by the municipality
of Neuilly. a suburb where the Ameri?
ean Ambulance is situated. The new
cards do not limit the amount of sugar
that mav be purchased, but make cer?
tain that only citizens of Neuilly can
buv nt Neuilly stores.
In a sense they encourage econom.,
as the date and quantity are noted on
the cards with each purchase. thus pre
venting too frequent marketing and the
storing of supplies by one person to
the detriment of othere.
Ifaaawhila a ?,?0<1 commission has
been created. ai.d began work to-day
to decide whether lugar cards shall be
issued in Paris. lt is comidered cer?
tain that the cards will be forthcoming
in a short time.

I awake to find myself in (.Iermany. Quivering with excitement, I
spring from bed and go to tho window. Beneath lies a courtyard, quiet,
still, no sign of lift*.
I press the electric button and order breakfast. A pale, worried
little man arrives with a tray. There is the same undrinkable coffee of
the night before, a tiny drop of blue, watery milk in a doll's pitcher no
biggcr than my thumb, no sugar, some black, sour, uneatable bread, no
butter and a small saucer of marmalade.
Irritation .-eizes me. How can I spend weeks in Germany without
prop4*r food? I remember my box of Ameriean crackers and the Danish
butter and sausage reposing in the hotel refrigerator. But I have the
decency not to send for them. I have at most some weeks of discomfort;
the (Jerman people, months of patient suffering.
POOK GR HEAT AM.OWANCE
The Danish food shall go to a German friend. Ry the time I am
dressed my travelling companion, No. oO, has joincd me. We decide to
make a tour of the city.
It is a pray. BOnlflflfl day. The weather increases the gloom of tho
city. Only a few people are upon the street?old people or very young
people and tiny children. But occasionally we pass to a eilent, dejeeted
group lined up before a meat shop.
It i. a meat day. Working women with babies in their arms or tiny
children carrying haskets, or old, decrr pit men and women, .lut.hing gov?
ernment meat cards, patiently await their turn. Thc shop door flies
open, three or four are admitted and a miserable half-pound of meat is
portioneii out to each.
Except for these food purcha-sers the city seems actionless. We en?

Falstaffian German commander is told
by K. de Feuquieres in the "Fetit ,

were not only symbolic of the warlike
spirit of the resident general, but had

the hero of Fashoda, tells In a letter
the story of his third wound, received
on the Somme. "My last wound does
not compare with either of tha other
two," he writes. "Thia time lt wa? a
piece of shell that entered my thigb and
broke against the fernor. Some tough
man to break a piece of ahell on his
bones!
"The shell which wounded me killed
my ordnance offlcer, Captain Jacque
met. It came out of the clouds and fell
almost on us. I hud taken out at once
most of the shell which went in me, but
there were two little pieces resting
against the femur and too near the
femoral artery to be extracted.
"I kept my post and continued to
command my troops, who were ao heav
Uy engaged that I could not leave for
any reason except death. To leave them
would have been desertion."

Flrat Snow of Seaaon
It was the first snow of the season,
following two days and nights of in
tense dry cold, which hardencri the
swamp of No Man's I.and after
nearly three months of r-nistant
rainfall, thus giving the attaek ing
infantry a rine foothold on the frozen
ground. They advancetl nearly a
quarter of a mile on a thn-e-nulc
front to the German position south
of the villages of Grandcourt, Petit
Miraurnont and Pys and occupied the
trench without great resistance, ev
cept south of Grandcourt, where the
latteries and machine guns holding
the sunken Pozieres road checked the
British.
Elsewhere the Garman trench wm

bombardment, the surviving German*,
including Saxons, formally surrender

On the north side of ihe Ancre the
