This means that housewives are not

Officials of tho Washington Fer

statements. This is the company
which contracts to collect the garbage
In the District. This garbage is
watched carefully both in quantity
and for Its quality.

"The quantity of garbage In Wash

at the rate of 2 per cent a year," said
an official of tho fertilizer company
today, "This Increaso In quantity

"Suddenly, In September of this

which delayed her departure almost

She hopes to make the trip In seven

speed of 125 miles an hour.
If she accomplishes tills she will
