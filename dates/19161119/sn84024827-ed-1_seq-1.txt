LAKE MICHIGAN
GIVES IIP BODY
(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, Nov. 18. The body of
nine year old Cyril, , "Sonny" Math
ews, who was lost from his home
nine months ago, was washed ashore
by Lake Michigan today. Search for
the boy had been kept up continuous
ly by his parents and by secret agents
but no trace of him had been found.
Gypsy bands, driving through Illi
nois and other Influences that may
have had to do with the boy's disap
pearance, had been investigated. Re
wards ' had been offered and scores
of detectives have been constantly on
the search without avail.
Playmate Finds Body
The body was found by a former
playmate of the little fellow who was
wandering along the lake shore, and
its recovery, the police believe, has
intensified rather than cleared the
mystery of his disappearance. It is
not btjieved possible that he had
been in the lake since his disappear
ance February 10. Numerous letters
received by the parents Inclined them
to the belief that the boy was held by
kidnappers who finally killed Mm in
fear of detection. The last of the let
ters came on October 31. It was en
closed in a cheap brown envelop and
in an old-fashioned hand was written
"Sonny Mathews died the twenty
first day he was lost."

YALE DEFEATS
PRINCETON IN
SLOW CONTEST
Eli Cohorts Go Wild With Joy
as Victorious Team Marches
From Field; Result Is Bitter
Disappointment to Tigers.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PRINCETON, N. J., Nov. 18. Yale
triumphed over Princeton in the an
nual football game here today by a
score of 10 to 0. The result of the
contest was a bitter disappointment
to Tiger adherents. 'Errors of play
and generalship by the Orange and
Black team virtually permitted all
opportunities for EH scoring. The
New Haven combination was quick to
take advantage of the openings and
the Blue won her third straight vic
tory from the Orange and Black.
Play is" Uncertain
The play was 'slow and uncertain
and both combinations repeatedly
failed to advance or retain possess
ion of the ball at critical moments.
Princeton showed the same defensive
strength which has' marked her play
against elevens all fall, but little or
no effective offensive. Yale, with a
better balanced combination, swung
loose a fair attack when scoring ap
peared possible and with a field goal
and touch down routed the Tigers.
Yale Cohorts Celebrate
Yale cohorts went wild with joy
when the Eli team, led by Captain
Tilleck, emerged victorious from a
contest in which it was thought Yale
had but an outside chance of winning
Under grades and haired alumni cel
ebrated with cheers and snake dances
while overhead two aeroplanes spir
alled and volplaned.
The contest throughout the first
two periods showed little advantage
either way. Both livens had oppor
tunities to kick field goals but in each
case poor generalship on the part of
the 'quarterbacks prevented scoring.
Easy Field Goal
Yale's initial chance followed im
mediately after the klckoff at the op
ening of the third period. Legore
drove the ball high to Princeton's 20
yard mark where the Princeton play
ers permitted it to strike the ground
and bound back into the arms of Left
End Moseley. He grabbed the sphere
and started for the Orange and Black
goal line. Cantain Hogg threw him
with a vicious tackle. ,
After two line plunges Braden
kicked an easy field goal from the 26
yard line.
In the fourth and final period the
B'iip c'i"ched the game by adding
a touchdown and goal from touch
down. Other of the more important tames

President Says He Hopes to
Help Create Spirit of Unity
and Purpose Among People
of the United States.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 18. President
Wilson told a delegation t.'jm the
American Federation of Labor late
today that all class feeling in America
should be wiped out by the establish
ment of "a justice with a heart in it".
He declared that no one who fails to
work for this end is qualified to call
himself a true American.
The delegation comprised the mem
bership of the federation's annual con
vention, which has been meeting in
P-altimore. The delegates came to
Washington to congratulate the Presi
dent on his re-election. Samuel Gom
pers acted as their spokesman, declar
ing laboring people had come to re
cognize that Mr. Wilson stands for
justice, freedom and righteousness.
Gompera Spokesman. t
"We have taken Joy in upholding
your hands in your great work," said
Mr. Gompers.
"I need not say that, coming to me
as you do on such an occasion, I am
very deeply gratified and very greatly
cheered," said the President in reply.
"It would be impossible for me off
hand to say just what thoughts are
stirred in me by what Mr. Gompers
has said to me as your spokesman
but perhaps the simplest thing I can
say it, after all, the meat of the whole
matter. What I have tried to d'J is
to get rid of any class division in this
country, not only, but of any class
consciousness and feeling. The worst
thing that could happen to America
would be that she should be divided
into groups and camps in which there
were men and bmen who thought
they were at odds with one another,
that the spirit of America was not ex
pressed except in them, and that pos
sibilities of antagonism were the only
things that we had to look forward to.
Pleads for Unity.
"Achievement is a comparatively
small matter, but the spirit in which
things are done is the essence of the
wh'jle thing, and what I am striving
for and what I hope you are striving
for. is to blot out all the lines of di
vision In America and create a unity
of spirit and purpose founded upon
this, the consciousness that we are all
men and women of the same sort and
that if we u'j not understand each oth
er, we are not true Americans. If we
cannot enter into: each other's
thoughts; if we cannot comprehend

"The policy of the war department
