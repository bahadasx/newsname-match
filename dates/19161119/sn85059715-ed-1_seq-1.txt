CHARLESTON, Nov. 18.?The stage
Is set for the 1016 extraordinary session
of the West Virginia legislature.
Scores of tho members arrl\-ed today
Including Senator Fred L. Fox. Democratic
leader In the upper house:
Senator Ben L. Rosenbloom. one of the
illlJfcJL i Lli JJ U t Lill 1 L U1 U1I3 tvcputnn-.auo IU
tljo legislature, and Septimus Hall,
of "Wetzel county, who is the oldest
member of the assembly in point of
service, and the only member of the
present legislature who was a member
of the constitutional convention of
1872.
The legislators themselves are not
certain whether the session will be a
stormy one, and the attitude of the
public is to wonder what It is all about.
All kinds of rumors are in circulation
and conjectures are many. JSvery possibility
is suggested on the streets
and in the hotel lobbies, while the old
timers are telling stories of the exciting
times incident to the Goff-Fleming
contest in assy, some 01 mem are
reciting about the factional followers
having pistols ready for use at the
slightest provocation.
Those about the capitol are inclined
to the belief that the session will be
peaceable and that the program of the
administration will he carried out
without much difficulty, while others
are equally firm In the assumption that
the Democrats will he able to muster
sufficient strength to block any acts
net in keeping with their interpretation
of their rights.

The letter says that at times during
the winter it may be necessary at intervals
to shut off the gas supply for
a day or half day at a time. Inability
of -the company to get pipe to enlarge
its gas shipping facilities is said
to be the cause of possible curtailment
of gas supply.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 18. ? Pres- 1
ldent Wilson told a delegation from ?
the American Federation of Labor
late today, that all class feeling In t
America should be wiped out by e?- b
tablishment of justice "with a heart 0
in it." He declared that no one who ^
fails to -work for this end is Qualified ^
to call himself a true American.
The delegation comprises the j
membership of the federation's an- j
nual convention, which has been <
meeting in Baltimore. i
The delegates came to Washington
on special cars and marched to the
White House headed by a band to con- i
gratulate the president on his re-elec- i
tlon. Samuel Gompers. president of r
the federation, acted as their spokes- g
man, declaring laboring people had
come to recognize that Mr. Wilson r
stands for justlco. freedom and right- t
eousness. "We have taken joy in up- e
holding your hands in your great f
work,'" said Mr. Gompers. - r
Deeply Gratified. \
"I need not say, coming to me as c
you do on such an errand, I am very c
deeply gratified and very greatly i
cheered," said the president In reply. (
"It would be Impossible for mo off- t
hand to Bay jnBt what thoughts are
stirrod In me by what Mr. Gompers
has said to me .as your spokesman, c
but perhaps the simplest thing I can *
say Is, after all the meat of the s
whole matter. What I have tried to S
do Is to get rid of any class division r
i in this country, not only one, but of
any .class consciousness and feeling. 1
TheNvorst thing that could happen ?
to America would -be that it should 1
be divided Into groups and camps in c
which thore were men and women 1
who thought that they were at odds
with one another, thaat the Bpirit
of America was not expressed except
in them, and that possibilities of antagonism
were the only things that wo e
had to look forward to, i
' Bpirit is the Essence. ]
"As Mr. Gompers said, achievement j
is a comparatively: small matter, but ]
the spirit In which thlngB are done, ]
is of the essence of the whole thing, t
and what l am striving for," and what c
I Tiope you aro striving for is to blot
oat all the lines of division in Ameri- ?
