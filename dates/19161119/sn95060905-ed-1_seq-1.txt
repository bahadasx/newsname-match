desert between Yuma and

btrip of countrj between this cttj
and Los Anseles called "the desert,"
report that Sundav, Mondaj and
Tuesda) of this week were the worst
das ever seen, so far as wind and
shifting sand are concerned. Great
clouds of sand practlcall) hid the sun
for hours at a time for miles and
miles of territory, and travelers were
compelled to simply stop at frequent
intervals and wait for "calm" spells.
At Ontario a section foreman, while
engaged clearing sand off the S I.
tracks so trains could pass, was
struck by a locomotive and instantly
killed. So bad was the sand blow
ing at the tine that he could neither
see the train nor the engineer see him
a distance of twent feet.
P. M Green of Ontario, and A. Kuy
kendall of Pomona, had a collision of
autos in the blinding storm and both
were seriously injured. A report
reached Yuma yesterday that a man,
i woman and child were lost Monday
and had not been found. This, how
ever, could not be confirmed.
It is stated that nn less than fifteen
aLtos were stalled in the sand at one
time in a distance Of less than fifty
miles, all of them being compelled to
stand still for nearly one whole hour
Farmers and people from the small
villages were kept busy with all their
horses and mules rescuing peoples'
cars from heaps of sand.

HIBIT AT FAIR
PHOENIX. Nov 17 For the first
lime in the history of the state fair,
an exhibit has been made from the
Arizona industrial school, situated at
lwt Grant, in Graham county. Thig
institution is under the direction of
lorn . Pulliam, formerly sheriff of
Coconino county, who with llrs. Pul
liam, a sweet motherly lady, has been
aetoung his entire time to Use work
-f reformation presented by the In
.urrlgibles of the state. That "the
-evil finds work for idle hands to
jo." is a firm tenet of belief with
..uih these good people, and because
f thib, they hate set the Inmates ot
ae school to useful tasks and hatt
-e exhibit on band to prove it.
ihe Industrial school sewing class
d now produce all the underwear and
jjirts used at the school, gome of
hich are on display. These are
strong serviceable garments, well
made, neatly sewed and capable of
.standing the wear and tear of the use
o which they are put. But it mu&t
iot be understood that they look like
-he garments ordinarily Imagined
when a reformatory Is mentioned.
Quite the reverse. The garments
could be worn by any working man
ith credit.
Fancy needlework is also on dis
play made by the girls of the school,
and some Of it is ot the highest type
of excellence and beauty. The lace
and tho entire garments were made
ay the girls of the school, and they
reflect not only credit upon the girls,
ut also on the instructors.

"I'VE DONE MY BIT ON THE
BORDER"
I've done my bit on the border
I'm in God s country again,
ne had my fill of the border.
Of greasers and border men.
i v e eaten the din of Texaj,
I've drunk of the Iilo Grande,
I've grubbed mesqulte in the cursed
heat,
(The Lord never made the land!)
I've seen all there Is to the border,
I've felt all there Is to feel.
I've done my time In a sea of slime,
I've lost all they didn't steal,
t ve done inv bit on the border.
At Draw ns wile and llano Graude.
I've hiked and bweat in the heat and
weL
From Pbarr to the end cf the land
I've done the camps at Mercedes,
At Donna and San Benite,
1 ve lam in the dust and gnaw ed a
crust
At Funston's judgment seat.
I've eaten my meals with reptiles,
I've Quartered with bug galoru
in a land where things all are made
with stings, -From
the trees to the rug on the
floor.
I've dug In the blasted trenches.
The air was a hundred hells
I've charged in the Jungle cactus,
To the music of rebel yells.
I've carried a pick in the Jungle,
Till It cut me down to the blood,
I've sweltered and lay like a thing
of clay.
In a slithering swamp of mud.
t've risen at five In the morning
At the sound of the reveille,
I've slaved all day for a newsboy's
pay
Till the night would set me free.
I've lived the life of a soldier.
No chance to "beat it" or shirk
And the life Of a soldier, believe me.
Is little but damned hard work.
I've eaten the food ot a soldier.
Hardtack and Mulligan stew.
Bacon and beans and a touch of
greens
But, Lord, they were scarce and
few!
I've followed the flag of my coujtry
In khaki and plain O. D.
And up to date I'm standing straight
In a way that Is good to see.
I've done my bit on the border,
I've had my fill of the border.
But I wouldn't trade the friends I've
made
For all I've lost In the game.
I've bad my filll of the border.
Of greasers and border men,
I've done my bit and I stand to rmlt.
And never take on again.
But I seem to know when the bugles
blow
And I hear the reveille.
That my blood 'will heat and my
pulses beat
No matter where I may be.
And I'll yearn to go with a burning
yearn
That only the soldier feels;
To slave and sweat In the heat and
wet.
To straighten and click my heels.
But I've done my bit on the border.
And now thank God, I'm free '
Altho' I know, when the bugles blow.
They'll have a call for me,
