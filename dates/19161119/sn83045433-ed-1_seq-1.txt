President Wilson made a plea for the
wiping out of all clan distinctions and
a cloer union of the American p5ople
In an address to delegates of the Ameor
can Federation of Labor at the White
House yesterday.
The President said that nothing worse
udM happen to this country than for
the people to imagine they were at odds
with one another, and concluded yith an
exhortation to all to join In the "common
movement for humanity."
"Tbe worst thing that could happen to
America would be that she should be
divided into groups and camps in which
there were men and women who thought
that they were at odds with one another,
that the spirit of America was not ex
presed except In them, and that poest
bilitles of antagonism were the only thing
that we had to look forward to," said
the President.
Warns Against Raita.
Nothing alarms America so much as
l ift. divisions, the drifting apart of ele
trents among her people, and the thing
we ought all to strive for is to close up
every rift, and the only way to do it, so
far as I can see. is to establish justice.
but justice with a heart in It. justice with
a puse in it, justice with sympathy In
it- Justice can be cold and forbidding.
or it can be warm and welcome. and the
ltter 16 the only kind of justice that
American. ought to desire."
The only other address was by Samuel
GoMpers, president of the American Fed
eratIon of Labor. who conveyed to the
President the congratulations of that
body upon his re-election and their wishes
for a successful admnnlsraation.
The delegates adjourned their convo
tion at Baltimore at noon and came to
Washington by special tram, there being

adopted a resolution recommending a
referendum to ascertain the opinion of
the business interests of the country on

avoid further recurrence of the situation
t reated by the recently threatened rali
rosd strike. and to 'make certain that
tiansportation facilities may be stabil

with the needs of comunerce and the en
tire public.'
A warm debate was precipitated when
a faction of the national council proposed
government ownership bf railroads as a
solution of the problem.

Not Afruld of Theeste.
There is nothing to Indicate in the
attitude of the White House that even
a threat of war would cause the Arter
ican forces to be brought out of Mexico
at this thee. The chief reason for this is
that Mr. Wilson has learned not to take
Mexican threats too eriously. He has
also been advised by the War Depart
ment that the territory in w"Ich Gen.
Pershing's base is located is so hostie
to Carrana that the constitutionalist
army would have difficulty In getting
within striking distance.
One member of the admInistration de
clared last night that President Wtl
son's patience was near the breaking
point. For the present. It was said, all
tentative orders for the recall of Na
