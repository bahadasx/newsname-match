DROPPING
SHEKELS
IN COURT
Many More Offenders of City Traffic Or
dinances Apprehended by
Sammy Dwyer
ORDINANCES ARE
OLD ONES REVIVED
Some of the Rules Which Must Be Ob
served to Keep Drivers From
Paying Fines
Victims of the rigid execution of the
traffic ordinances, especially the own.
ers of automobiles Which have not been
managed in strict accordance with the
law, are taking their medicine in va
rious degrees of complaisance or dis-
ffBi, according to their moods. Some
ma.ie donations of the usual "five
others send checks to the city offi
cials with a smile and their compli
ments, others frown, while only one
thus far has refused to pay his fine
and is said to be thinking of appealing
his case. . .
Is Old Ordinance.
It developed that many of the of
fenders were ignorant of the fact that
tile rules that are being strictly enforc
ci'l by the motorcycle cop and by other
officers so well during the past few
days are parts and parcels of city or
dinances which wre enacted months
ago and which should have been com
plied with during the intervening pe
riod. It was only after action had
been taken by the city council in th
appointment of a motorcycle cop that
the old law was revived and all police
officers instructed to enforce it.. What
was considered by some to be the best
part of the ordinance and which has
become a component part of the city
traffic rules in those large cities where
the. traffic is orderly regulated in very
' congested districts, was killed when
the council made it optional with the
driver whether or not he should go
to the opposite side of an intersecting
street before making a turn. As it is
now the driver may decide whether
the congestion of the thoroughfare is
such as to force him to take this long
turn or to turn in the middle of the
block to the opposite Bide of the street.
Dorl't Cut the Corners.
However, cutting corners must be
stopped says Police Chief Phillips.
For instance, a driver of a vehicle trav
eling south on Fourth street and wish
ing to turn in to the east on Chickasha
avenue must travel to the south side
of the intersecting strept before muk
in? the full turn, and keeping to the
right side of the street until the cor
ner is well passed. In violating this
rule many have come to grief.
A Big Roundup.
Following was yesterday's crop of
victims of police vigilance who ap
peared in police court today:
L,ee unve, arresrea ny umcer tsairo,
cutting corner, fined $5, paid; H. M. Di
pers, arrested, by Dwyer, jay driving
corner Fourth and Kansas, forfeited
$5 bond; Ernest Moore, negro, who
was arrested for carrying and discharg
ing a gun, fined $23 and given thirty
days in jail and turned over to the
county; Ben Brooks, whom Mayor
C'offman lias known -since the fall of
'SI, when caught ceatt to rights, "fto
nated" $3 to avoid arrest; Tom Fath
eree, for jay driving at Third and
Kansas, trial set for 4 p. m., as was
that of Miss Woodson for the same of
fense at Fourth and Chickasha; A. B.
Chalfant phoned to the officers to
come down and get his check for $5
for jay driving at Fourth and Chick
asha avenue; E. Tignor forfeited a $3
bond for jay riding into one of the
Barton garages and A. C. Key, who
was arrested by Chief of Police Phil
lips for speeding, also forfeited a $3
bond.
Will Appeal Case.
"William lnman has not paid his
fine as announced in the Express yes
terday," said Mayor Coffman, "and 1
understand he is thinking of appealing
thp case." i

LOOKS GOOD
TO OILERS
Showing at Cement and Other Indications
Lead to Belief that New Pool
Will Be Found
Althousji the quantity of oil in the
test well near Cement, but a few
miles frcin the west line of Grady
county, remains undetermined, the
showing there has already attracted
attention of oil men to this county and
the scramble for leases is said to be
lively.
The fact that the oil sand in the Ce
ment well was struck at ti83 feet and
is near the west line of Grady county,"
said a man who has given much atten
tion to this section as a possible oil
field, "and the fact that the R. M.
Conway gas well recently brought in
near Duncan is near the southwest
corner of the county and that the Dun
lin gas field is near the southern line
while the big gas well at Fox is very
close to the southeast corner of the
county would lead to the belief that
the main pool of oil may be found
near the center of Grady county."
One of the most important tests now
drilling in this section is that of the
Unity Oil Co., of Kansas City near
Alex. This test is being watched with
interest by oil men all over the state
The well is now 623 feet deep. Drill
ing has been long delayed by failure
to get an under-reamer but it is stat
ed the latter will be shipped from Tul
sa tomorrow and it Is expected that
drilling will be resumed at once. The
company already has 1000 feet of 10
inch casing on the ground.
After a delay of several weeks, due
to the tardy approval by the state
board of public utilities valuations, the
county excise board met at 9 o'clock
this morning in the county commis
sioners' room, County Judge R. E. Da
venpord presiding.
The county excise board is compos
ed of the county judge as chairman,
tho county clerk as secretary, the
county treasurer, the county attorney
and the superintendent of public
schools.
Secretary Bradley expressed the
opinion this morning that the first
consideration would be given to the
county valuations and estimates, w hich
will probably be followed by tho budg
et of the city oi Chickasha, then by
those of the cities in Grady county,
the townships and school districts.
The county assessor's valuations
were approved by the state board of
equalization and returned here sever
al weeks ago. The delay was caused J
by (lie state board holding back pub
lic service valuations which are made
by that board. Their work in this re
spect Is greater in this county than in
almost any other county in Oklahoma
owing to the number of railroads and
the additional improvements by the
railroads and the local telephone com
pany. Until the total valuation was
received the excise board could not
enter upon its labor of considering
and approving the various budgets.
A committee of city officials con
sisting of Mayor Coffman, City Treas
urer Clark and City Attorney Grigsby
appeared before the excise board to
day to present the claims of the city
In the matter of the Chickasha budget.

That the Chickasha Express is read

ried Louis Nelson to a ditch eighteen
feet below the bridge near,Norge Sun
day ever had been or ever could be
out of order.
"Tho Express had not been off the
press for fifteen minutes when every
body down town was asking me about
the Ford steering gear," said the Ford
man.
"It Is an utter impossibility for the
steerir.y; gear of the Ford car to get
out 'if order or to refuse to work. The
trot.ble was that the owner had only
recently purchased tho car and was
hot thoroughly familiar with it. The
