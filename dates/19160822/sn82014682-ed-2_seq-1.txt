Negotiations begun months ago for the outright tale of Makee Sugar

and will possibly be settled in detail by the time this paper reaches Its
redThe price is said to be In the neighborhood of $1,700,000, but this is
not definite. When the Star-Bulletin In July printed an exclusive story
forecasting the sale, the guess was hazarded that the figure would be
between $1,500,000 and $200,000. A Lihue stockholder acquainted with the
details said today that the Star-Bulletin's first story "had the figures
about right, n and added that the price when known might be considered
high, but that the plantation's record and prospects justified it
This deal, by which one large and

Col. Z. 6. Spalding, head of the
Spalding Interests and a prominent
figure on Kauai for more than a gen
eration, arrived in' Honolulu on the
steamer Maul on Saturday. His son,
Rufus P. Spalding, came from San
Francisco on the Sierra yesterday to
join his father in discussion of terms
with, the Lihue directors. y v
Late yesterday It was learned that
agreement on the deal had been
reached, but there: remained a i number"
of Important details to be completed.
Inquiry at the office of the Lihue
Sency, H. Hackfeld & Co, brought
the response that the deal had not yet
been , completed, but the indications
, were that during the day most of the
remaining points would be settled.
Rufus, P. Spalding said over the
telephone this morning that he could
cot at that time discuss the transac

remained not , agreed upon.' How
ever, a Lihue stockholder familiar
with the developments Is authority
for the statement that the deal Is so
far closed that it may be regarded as
a moral certainty.'. '

Lihue directors and officers and
Col. Spalding, as well as territorial
oflfcials, met in the governor's office
: this morning to discuss government
.water rates and distribution. It was
' denied that this meeting had any
thing to do " with the Llhue-Makee
deal, but it IS admitted that there is
a close relation between the two mat
ters, as tne agreement with the gov

the relations between the two planta

RECEILY MADE
Honolulu is Proper Place for
Peace Conference; Indorses
Preparedness Parade
. Heading the Star-Bulletin's story of
yesterday on the suggestion of "Daily
Financial America" that Honolulu be
the site of a. world-peace conference
after the war. Mayor Lane commented:''.'-
"Surely If there Is any place in the
world especially suitable for a peace
conference It Is Honolulu. Far awaj
from the strife of the world, in a mild,
peaceful climate, with minds at ease,
the emissaries of the governments of
the world gathered here would quickly
come to terms.
"Honolulu's accessible position, as
suggested in the Star-Bulletin, is an
other argument for selecting It as .a
site for the conference. I am sure that
'every effort-win :be made by the citi
zens of this city to bring it here."
Relative to the proposed "Prepared
ness Parade," Mayor Lane agrees
with the suggestion that Kalakaua
Day, November 16, is a fitting time to
hold it- "The King was a military
enthusiast," be declared. "A prepar
edness parade would be an appropri
ate celebration of his birthday. It
could pe held after the tribute to the
queen in the morning and before the
aquatic sports in the afternoon.

Prospects for a' peaceful 1 settlement
or temporary adjustment of the rail
road " strike crisis were brighter . to
day, and confidence in the outcome of
negotiations was expressed following
a meeting of the president and his
cabinet.
While the railroad executives were
working on their counter-proposal to
the Dresident'a dan for averting a
strike, the cabinet meeting was held
Several leading administration offi
cials express confidence that the pres
ident a plan, which involves the tem
porary : acceptance by the railroad
men of the eight-hour day, would fin
ally ba adopted. The railroad men so
far have Insisted that the controversy
be submitted to arbitration.
There are no indications when the
railroad presidents will Iiave their
ccunter-proposal ready for submission.
Getting Away From Wilson.
Following the conferences held by
the railroad president, Blewitt Lee,
spokesmen and chairman of the con
ference, said that the trend of opinion
was away from the president's plan.
"It is inconceivable," he declared,
"that the railroads should be called
upen to grant demands which would
mean the payment of $50,000,000 addi
tional wages to a preferred class of
their employes, and a class that Is in
the minority, and that the demands
should be granted under the threat
of a strike such as this, which would
paralyze the entire Industrial and
commercial activities of the nation.
Certainly it is impossible to conveive
that such action should be taken by
the trallroads without "appealing to
the last court in this country, public
opinion. :.:
In continuing his statement Mr.
Lee Intimated' Cat the lines are pre-
, pared to take whatever course the
country desires, for we realize that
' public opinion must decide this con
troversy.".

Senator and Former National
Committeeman Makes
Announcement .
Charles A. Rice, territorial senator
from Kauai, and in the race for dele
gate to Congress two years-ago, is out
of politics this season as an active
or receptive candidate.
He made this announcement today
in response to questions by the Star
Bulletin, i confirming reports given
much credence during the past few
months that for the .flret time in
many yeafs he will be a candidate for
no office.,
"I am retiring from politics for two
years," said the Kauai senator, who
came to Honolulu for a brief business
trip. "I will not run either for the
delegateship or for senator again."
. Asked why he is not a candidate,
he said that he does not wish to go
after the Republican nomination for
delegate this year, nor does he seek
reelection as senator because if elect
ed to the 'upper house of the legisla
ture he would be tied up for a four-
year term.' He expects to be handling j
much business during the next two
years and may be out of the territory
a good deal.
T-l T .1 A. i
mmhr. from TCsna! i ranrHdntn
for senator to take Rice's place and
he ii said to be virtually vsure of elec
tion;" He wilf probably have no' oppo
sition for the Reoublican nomination
and is likely to receive such a large
vote that he will be elected at the pri
maries.: ' ..
Rice was Republican national com
mitteeman during the last term, being
succeeded by Robert W. Breckons.
With the i definite announcement
that Rice is not a candidate for the
delegateship, It looks as if there will
be no opposition to the renomination
of Prince Kuhio Dy tho Republicans,
and : bo far no . DemocralTc ; asDirant
has announced himself. L. L. Mc-

yesterday noon, may reveal the fate
of : the five enlisted men from Fort

July 15. '-. ;.-'.'- :-
On that date" they took a" 17-foot
whaleboat, equipped with auxiliary

and were to bring It around Kaena
Point and into Pearl Harbor. Since
then no tidings have come from the
five men and an army board of in
quiry has reported them dead, the
findings being sent to Washington.
Yesterday a good-sized whaleboat
came from the sea to the Kallua reef,
an eighth of a mile from shore, and
telephone reports today said that the
craft was still on the coral barrier.
It is lying upside down on the reef
and so firmly wedged there that Ha
