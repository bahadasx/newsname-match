G.O.P.
Climax in Republican Row as
Chairman Makes Taft Man
ager His First Aid.
CRANE IN A DUDGEON.'
But With Penrose and Sinoot
He Is Told to Accept Sit
uation or Get Out.
Political dissensions and personal
Jealousies that havo nearly wrcked
tho Republican national c.impu.gn
reached a climax to-d,y In New York
headquarters, resulting In elimination
of the Republican Old Guaid and a
revolution In management. Against
tha protest of Murray Crane, Senator
Penrose and Senator Smoot, National
Chairman Wlllcox appointed Frank It.
Hitchcock a member of the Advisory
Committee and principal practical aide
In running the campaign.
Finding that all his endeavors to
promote harmony among the factions
by persuasive methods were fruitless.
Chairman Wlllcox suddenly shifted
his policy to-day and notified every
body that he Intended running things
his own way and If tho Old Guard
kickers didn't like It, they could get
out. Crane of Massachusetts Is re
ported to bn In high dudgeon.
The strife centred on Hitchcock,
against whom the Old Guard have a
long standing grievance dating haul;
to tho campaign of 190S which he rait
for Taft. Chairman Wlllcox an
nounced tho complete: advisory com
mittee n. follows:
R. Livingston Ilecckmnn, Governor
of Rhode Island; Theodore U. Hurton,
former Senator from Ohio: Charles
G. Dawes, Chicago banker and poll
tlclau; A. O. Kberhurdt, former Gov
ernor of Minnesota: Charles W. Ful
ton, former Senator from Oregon:
Frank II. Hitchcock, Chairman of the
1904 National Committee: Raymond
Robins, Chairman of the Chicago
Progressive Convention: Victor Roso
wator of Omaha, John Wanamaker,
William L. Ward of Now York and
James Wilson of Iowa, former Sec
retary of Agriculture.
While the Chairman said that this
committee oltlclally would act merely
In an advisory capacity, It Is under
stood that Hitchcock and several
others will tnko actlvo part In general
direction of tho campaign,
A radical change In programme Is
to take place at once. Instead of
cautious pussy-footing and secret
conferring behind closed doors,
a vigorous policy of nggresslon will
bo followed. The old Roosevelt Hlg
Stick Is to be brought out of cold
storage and swung with vigor. T. R.'h
tlrst speech In the Maine campaign
Is reported full of tiro and ginger.
It Is to sot a new pace for all other
campaign orators.
As for kickers and grumblers In the
Republican-Progressive combination,
they can fall In line or ret out. Chair
man Wlllcox Is In lighting mood and
tartcd cracking hoods right and
left.
"I was appointed to run this ram
palgn," ho said, "The responsibility
Is put on mo and 1 accept It. Hut uj
I am responsible, I Intend to run
thlnga In accordance with my best
Judgment. I havo boon obliged to
give a great deal of attention in the
past to arrangement of details, but
now with tho appointment of this ad
vlsory committee, tho way Is cleared
for vigorous, aggresslvu work,"
It Is expected at hond'iunrter.i that
orderly system will miuii t.iku the
place of present ch.ioiio conditions.
