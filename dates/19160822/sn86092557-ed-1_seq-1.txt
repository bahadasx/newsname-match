Prominent and consplcious among
the other concessions and booths on
the ground today were the booths of
tho Suffrage and the AUtl?Suffrage
parties. It had originally been plan
ned to place these booths side by
side by the Fair officials, but violtnt
opposition to this plan by the "Antls"
led to placing the booths today at sep
arate ends of the grounds and as far
possible. The "Antls" stated that they
feared the harsh words of the suff
ragists and unless the recruiting tents
of the Second regiment soldiers was
placed betwten them they wished to
move. The recruiting squad declined
the honor and it wa8 necessary to
move the booths.

Announcement was made today that |
the plant of the Fairmont Mining Ma

one-third more than its present sizej
and when the new improvements are

braces a wide scope and mining sup
plies are often shipped to foreign
countrios. The present plant has about
reached its limit in the production of
machinery and for this reason the ad-,
dition to the plant will be construct
ed at once.

Produces Evidence Showing
Vice Interests Support
Opposition,
MORGANTOWN, W. Va., Aug. 22.?
At the headquarters of the West Vir
ginia Equal Suffrage Association in
this city today the challenge of the
speakers for the Anti-Sultraglsts, in
which they offer $500 for the produc
tion of evidence showing any connec
tion between the organized liquor in
terests of the country and the organi
zation opposed to equal suffrage, was
accepted and the evidence offered to
the public.
Mrs. Yost, the president of the State
Suffrage Association and chairman of
the campaign committee, stated in
making public a portion of the evi
dence in hand, that it is the policy of
the state organization to avoid per
sonalities and controversies. But, em
boldened by this desire on the part
of those favoring the pending amend
ment, these Anti speaker have chal
lenged the production of evidence.
Under these circumstances it would be
folly longer t keep from the public
the documentary proo: that the organ
ized liquor interests of the country
are aiding in the financing of the anti
fight against votes for women.
Continuing Mrs. Yost said that re
cently In the city of Huntington, Miss
Marjorie Dorman, who claimed to be
a member of the W. C. T. U., offered a
reward of $500 for the production of
this evidence. "Of course," said the
charming president of the Suffragists,
"we know that the money reward is
as hazy as any of the other arguments
of the deluded opposition, and we have
no expectation, even though our evi
dence is absolute and unquestionable,
thta the antis will keep the terms of
thier challenge.
It appears, from the evidence pro
duced at headquarters today, that near
the close of the campaign In the Wol
verine state the text of one of the leaf
lets of the Michigan Association Op
posed to Woman Suffrage appeared as
a paid advertisement in a number of
the newspapers in Macomb county.
The advertisement bore the names
and addresses of the officers of the
state association of antis-. It was an
earnest and energetic appeal to the
electorate to vote against equal suf
frage. This appeal was signed as fol
lows:
"Issued by Michigan Association op
posed to Woman Suffrage, office 1128
Majestic Building, Detroit, Phone num
ber Cherry 4726.
"President, Mrs. Henry L. Lyster,
the Pasadena Opartments;
"Treasurer, Mrs. James Cosslett
Smith, the Palmes Apartments;
"Secretary, Miss Helen E. Keep, 753
Jefferson avenue;
"Corresponding Secretary, Mrs. Wm.
S. Perome, 84 Prentis avenue;
"Vice Presidents, Mrs. L. E. Clark.
Mrs. C. A. Kent, Mrs. Chas. W. Cas
grain, Miss Stella Ford."
One of the Cacomb county editors
who chanced to receive the copy of
the advertisement, also received the
following letter accompanying the *r-'
der f-r insertion. Recognizing the fact
that the copy was offered under false
pretenses and that the letter was ab
solute evidence of the connection of
the liquor organizations with the An
tis' organization, he sent the letter to
the Detroit Journal which printed it.
The original letter was turned over
by the Journal to Mrs. Clara B. Arthur,
president of the Michigan W. C. T. U.,
and it is now in her possession.
The letter is as follows:
"Macomb County Retail Liquor Deal
ers' Association,
"Office of the Secretary.
"MT. CLEMENS, Mich.,
"March 31,1918.
"To the Publishers:
"I enclose herewith copy for advt.
which I wish you woi'd insert in this
week's issue of your paper, making it
ten inches in depth, double column, on
your local page or front page, If pos
sible.
"I will thank you to see that this
is done and mail statements of charges
and also marked copy to me and we
will remit for the sale.
"Thanking you in advance for your
attention t this matter, I am,
"Yours truly,
"JOSEPH MATTHEWS,
"Secretary."
It was intimated by Mrs. Yost, that,
inasmuch as Miss Dorman i in Fair
mont this week, no better opportunity
for the payment of the $500 reward
would present itself during the nend
ing campaign. Such a "Shower of
Gold" would be most welcome to the
organization.

WORK ON COMPROMISE
Committee of Eight Emin
ent Railroad Men are
Doing It.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 22?As lue
railroad executives were not ready for
another conference this morning Pres
ident Wilson called the cabinet to dis
pose of business which has accumulat
ed while ho has been considering the
strike problem.
At ten this morning the men went
into a meeting which was attended
by leaders of all four Brotherhoods.
No special purpose is attached to it and
the leaders said it was ust to keep
the men together.
A statement in reply to the argu
ments of the railroad executives on
the question of arbitration was being
prepared by leaders and probably will
be issued for publication tomorrow.
The brotherhood officials describe
the situation as unchanged. The rail
road executives made a formal an
nouncement that consideration of the
situation had been turned over to a
committee of eight and that no con
clusions had been reached. The fol
lowing were announced as members
of committee which will work on Pres
ident Wilson's proposal and make a
report to the assembled executives;
Hale Holden, Burlington; W. W. At
terbury, Pennsylvania; Fairfax Harri
son, Southern; Robert S. Lovett, Un
ion Pacific; E. P.- RipUfyi Santa Fe; A.
H. Smith, New York Central; Frank
Trumbull, C. and 0.; Daniel Willard,
B. and 0.
While the sub committee was work
ing the executives got in touch with
their boards of directors. It was un
derstood that a reply might be ready
for President Wilson tonight or to
morrow morning. In administration
circles it was said there was no hope
of a settlement
The exact nature of the proposal to
be submitted to Presdient Wilson was
not revealed but from the fact that the
executives were in communication
with their boards of directors the con
clusoin was drawn that it confirmed
the concessions of the eight hour day.
One suggestion understood to be un
derstood to be under consideration
was the submission of the collateral
issues to the Inter State commerce
commission or a provision for making
permanent the commission of investi
gation suggested by President Wilson.
The brotherhood meeting did noth
ing and adn^irned till three o'clock
this afternoon.
An invitation from Vice President
"Marshall to all of the representatives
to visit the Senate today was accept
ed.

ATHENS, Aug. 22?The occupation
of Kastoria and Corytsa by Bulgarian
troops is confirmed. News from unof

marshal August Mackensen is with

Kastoria is 25 miles south of Mon

Greeks See End of
Dream of Empire
ATHENS, July 31, delayed by censor
?An initial brigade of Russian troops
has arrived at Saloniki to Join the en
tente allies in the fighting in the Bal
kans.
The arrival of the Russians has
created a profound Impression hero.
Even royalists who have consistently
opposed participation in the war, by
Greece, on the side of the entente al
lies seemed almost stunned by the
news that Russian troops had arriv
ed to take part in a campaign which
made other conditions might have:
been taken by a Greek army.
The general feeling here is that the j
bringing in of Russian troops has dis
pelled definitely the dream of greater]
Greece which was conceived a year
and a half ago by. the then Premier
Venizelos who carried Greece well on
the way toward the entrance into the
war on the side of the Entente alies.
It is regarded as possible that the
presence of Russian forces in Mace
donia will effect a change in the atti
tude of Bulgaria.
In some, quarters irritation is dis
played at recent foreign policy of the
Greek government which is said to
have overlooked the interests of this
nation.
After a conference of French, Brit
ish, Serbian and Russaln commanders
at Saloniki today it was decided that
the newly arrived Russian forces
would take up positions with Serbian
troops on the southern frontier of
Serbia.
The Serbo-Russlan force was plac
ed under a combined staff of which
the rown Prince Alexander of Serbia
is the nominal commander. The Rus
sian general Frederictsz is nl actual
command.
Greeks Are Fighting
the Bulgarians
LONDON, Aug. 22.?Greek troops
have been fighting Bulgarians in the
vicinity of Seres since Sunday, says
an Athens dispatch to the Exchange
Telegraph Company. The Greek com
mander has called to arms all reserv
ists in that locality, says a dispatch.
That the fighting is of stubborn char
acter is indicated by the fact that large
number of Greek soldiers have been
killed.

Next Friday. August 25, the Grand

bers will meet in the Masonic Templo
here to arrange with Fairmont Lodge

side the cornerstone will be placed the
articles taken out of the cornerstone
of the rated building. These articles
were put into a tin box nearly 40 years
ago and put lnalde the cornerstone of
] the old church. When taken out sev
eral weeks ago they were discovered
to bo covered with rust and In bad
condition. Jhls time the box in which
they are placed will be airtight and
half a century from next Friday, should
they be taken out to make room for a
new cornerstone in a new church, they
undoubtedly will be well preserved.
The laying of the cornerstone will
take place In the evening when hun
dreds can attend the ceremony. Pres
byterians will be there in large num

Mayor Resents Criticism of Subordinate And
Greater Efficiency on Part of Employees
of Other Departments.
SANITARY OFFICER PITZER UNDER FIAI
Is Accused of Not Being Able to Take Care of His!
Outhouses Must Go If He Has to Go
With Them.
At an adjourned mc Hing this morn
ing of 'ho City Board 01 Affaire, tho
levy for the city of Fairmont for tho
ensuing year was laid. This levy var
ies none whatever \ ith the original
estimate.
Several residents of Hill Crest ap
peared before the Board asking that
the city install lights on tho Hill Crest
road so that drunken auto parlies can
not congregate at that point. Tho
Board reierred the matter to the Com
missioner of Streets, Albert L. Leh
man. aud to the Finance Commissioner,
J. Walter Barnes. The Board figured
that the required number of lights for
use in that section would cost more
than the taxpayers in the city limits
at Hill Crest pay. One light would
cost as much to run for one year as the
entire amount of the taxes paid in.
In a petition signed by The Miller
Clurk Grain company, John A. Clark,
president; J. P. hart and G. Al. Lilley,
ihe Board was requested to grade and
pave Seventh street from Chamberlain
avenue to Virginia avenue. The mat
ter was taken under consideration.
During the meeting a controversy
arose wnich took up a half hour of the
Board's time. There has been much
agitation recently against out houses
within the city limits at places where
sewerage has been installed. Upon In
vestigation this morning one of the
commissioners stated that there were
a number of c mplaints against the
work of Sanitary Officer Pitzer and
suggested to Mayor Bowen that he be
dismissed from the sanitary office li
the work cannot be done better. The
street commissioner informed thtj
gathering that there was something
wrong with the sanitary officer if he
could not locate the persons at fai/it
and that there has been for the past
year numerous violations of the sani
tary code on the South Side where
dozens of families publicly burn trash
on the Baptist church property. The
mayor stated that it ha| been impossi
ble to find who does tills. Other mem
bers of the Board insisted that it was
an every day affair and that something
muBt be done. This Jumping on the
police department so riled the mayor
that he turned white but he kept a Arm
grip upon himself. He responded to
the street commissioner saying:
"That talk about my department'
makes mo sick. I'm getting tired of
being bawled out in public and?"
Here Commissioner Lehman injected,
"All matters here are public." "And,"
the mayor went rn, "I'm going to say
a few things about your department.
For instance what business have you
of keeping a white man as boss at $3 a
day, over two Italians working by the
day on the bridge? What In the devil
does this garbage man you pcy a sal
ary to, do for the city? He rides around
on a cart and does nothing. How do I
know what he does, he never makes re
port to me; he never comes around the
office, and besides how about that man
that picks paper up off the streets?

laughed and as Commliwoner Ira

In which the city was running things
and said, "There Is so much good In
