Sides Claim Successes in the Battle on the Crest of the
Carpathians In France There Has Been No Material
Change Since Last Friday
The great offensive launched by the
allies on Sunday on th Saloniki front
is progressive but n. far no decisive
action haa been fought. The British
find French are advancing on the
right of the lino and have crossed the
Struma, pushing forward in a north
easterly direction reward tlie Bul
garian frontier. At t.ie same time the
Serbians have opened a drive for
Monastir and repoit the rapture of
first line Bulgarian trenches. On the
extreme left, however, immediately
south of Monastir. they have suffered
a reverse and liav? evacuated ths
Greek town of Banica.
In the center, at the mouth of the

highway through Serbia, vlolen ar

dow nthis valley that the Teuton-Bulgarian
forces made their vloc rioiis

experts. Its possession is vital to who

This newa, f corroborated, rmans that
Italy has finally decided to formally
declare war on Germany as the Ger
mans are admitt-.xlly directing the
Bulgarian campaign. At certain
points on the front, Berlin reports the
Bulgarians to bt on the offensive, but
London and Paris interpret this as -a
move for political purposes and not as
a serious attack against Saloniki. A
desire to affect public opinion in Ru
mania and to influence the approach

hind Bulgaria's aggressive action, in
the opinion of the allied capitals.
Fierce Fighting on Eastern Front.
Fierce fighting continues in the re
gion of the Srcknod, on the eastern
front, where the Russian advance
menaces botr. Kovei and the German
salient at Pinsk. The battle on the
crest of the Carpathians is also still
raging, both sides caiming minor suc

On the western front there has been
no material change in the Situation

ESTABLISHMENT OF MINIMUM
WAGE FOR ALL WORKERS
Advocated at Social Session of Fed
eration of Catholic Societies.
New York, Aug. 21. Establishment
of a minimum wage for all workers
wa3 discussed here tqntght at a so
cial service meeting of the American
Federation of Catholic Societies. Pro
fessor James E. Haggerty of Ohio
State TJniversitp presided and the
speakers were Bishop P. J. Muldoon
of Rockford, Ills.; the Rev. Edwin V,
O'Hara, chairman of the Oregon State
Commission on the Minimum wage
end the Rev. John A. Ryan of Catho
lic University in Washington, D. C.
Bishop Muldoon asserted ' that the
problem of social service is so im
portant that the federation has de
cided to hold a separate meeting in
future conventions. Professor Hag
gerty declared that not more than 15
per cent, of wage earners in the Unit
ed States are ryganized, These, he
said, are skilled workers.
He asserted that investigations show
that a family of five requires from
$700 to $1,000 yearly to live.
"Three-fourths of the unskilled
workers of the country earn less than
$700," he said, "It has been deter
mined that a woman cannot live on
less than $8 a week, but ihree-fourths
of the women wage earners of the
country get les3 than that amount."
SALE OF DANISH WEST
INDIES SEEMS CLEARER
Belief Prevails That a Coalition Cab
inet In Denmark May Oppose It.
Copenhagen, via London, Aug. 21.
After a lengthy meeting today which
was attended by delegates from each
party and members of the government
the situation with regard to the sale
of the Danish West Indies seems
clearer and the belief prevails that a
(coalition cabinet can be formed and
the terms of the sale of the islanls
settled. The proposed new cabinet
would include twelve members in
stead of ten, ns at present. ' Thus
each party would have three repre
sentatives in the cabinet. The two
additional ministers would hold office
without portfolio.
It is expected that if the coalition
ministry is formed Erick de Schav
enlus will remain as minister of for
eign affairs and that Premier Zahle

cess. The Germans have also made a
powerful effort to recapture Fleury in
the Verdun rector, but Paris reports
their complete ropul3e.
The repeated uno cial reports that
Portugal was about to take an active
share on the European battlefield are
apparently confirmed by an announce
ment from Paris that a British
French military commission has been
sent to Lisbon. News despatches from
Portugal have described military pre
parations of a very extensive charac
ter but there has been nothing yet to
indicate the number of men she has
under arms.
Rumors of Rumania's Entry Into Con
flict. The opening of the allied offensive
at Saloniki has been the signal for
renewed reports that Rumania is at
last about to throw in her lot with
the entente. These reports sire more
circumstantial than ever before and
the comments of the German press
indicate that they are far from being
devoid of foundation. One Berlin
newspaper goes so far as to declare
that Rumania has already joined the
allies and that plans are being laid
for the march of a Russian army
through Rumania territory. Major
Moraht, the famous German military
critic, also believes that Rumania is
negotiating with Russia and hints at
an ultimatum to Bucharest from Ger
many and Austria.
Has 500,030 Troops Mobilized.
The entry of Rumania into the war
on the side of th eentente would mean
the forging of another link in the
chain of foes surrounding the central
powers. The material aid which Ru
mania could give would be very im
portant. She has had between SOO.OOO
and 600,000 troops mobilized for nearly
a year and her army is reputed to be
one of the best equipped and trained
In Europe. Apart from possible Rus
sian reinforcement, Rumania would be
In a position to deal a powerful blow
at Bulgaria from the north In conjunc
tion with the allies' drive from the
south. It has been generally under
stood that Russia has been willing to
concede the province of Bessarabia,
the population of which Is largely Ru
manian, in return for Rumanln co
opertion in the war. Bessarabia is
18,000 square miles in extent and has
a population of nearly two million.
WARSHIP CONSTRUCTION ON
BRITISH WATERFRONT
They Include Every Type From Sub
marines to Battleship.
London, Aug, 21. There Is a certain
small section of British water-front
where more ships are under construc
tion today than the entire shipbuilding
facilities of any other nation could
undertake at one time, They include
every tpye of craft from submarines
to battleships and from steam trawl
ers to Atlantic liners. Most govern
cruisers singly, and the lesser craft

perhaps in pairs, but here battleships
loon up as twins, light cruisers by the

wit'.i many braces of long submarines,
and an occasional monitor.

HUGHES
VIE
JNES HIS
W CAMPAIGN ISSUES
Addressed an Audience on the Expo
sition Grounds at San Diego, Cal.
San Diego, Calif., Aug. 21. Charles
. Hughes, addressing an audience
on the exposition grounds here today,
outlined his views on the protective
tariff, dominant Americanism, nation
al unity and preparedness.
Mr, Hughes cited the removal of the
tariff on sugar, by the Underwood act
as an illustration of a policy to which
fte was opposed.
'"Why should there have been an at
tempt to cripple and destroy the su
gar industry in this country V" he said.
"Was there any reason for it? Was
there any statesmanship in it '! Was
it called for by the country? No.
"Our friends discovered their mis
take after a while, but we desire to
be represented by those who have
foresight and not simply hindsight.
"America must be sound and hon
est in its public life, but it must be
business-lifke, it must be direct, it
must be patriotic, with America lirst
and America efficient.
"My friends of California, do not
misunderstand me. There is not go
ing to be any private grip on any
public privilege for any corporate in
terest or combination of interests at
the expense of the Interests o the
people of the United States if I can
prevent it."
Mr. Hughes spoke of the need of
"industrial co-operation."
"The man who looks upon his la
borers simply as mere economic units
has not caught the vision of the twen
tieth century," he said.
"What we need in this country is
not demagoguery, nor stand-patism,
but the sense of a deep desire to ben
efit our fellowrnen by working to
gether to that end, according to the
spirit of our institutions."
"We do not wish to wait," Mr.
Hughes continued, "until an impor
tant industry is crippled and in dan
ger of destruction.
"The good people of Louisiana pro
tested in vain. They went to their
own administration in vain. They
presented facts only to be disregard
ed. "Now, I protest against any action
aimed at the crippling' of American
enterprice. Why should American in
dustries go out of business'.' In order
trat we may buy goods abroad? That
is not sound American policy."
The nominee declared he favored
"the protection of the generations of
the future."
"I believe In preventing children
from being drawn too early into the
hardships of industrial life," he said.
Mr. Hughes again assailed the ad
ministration for its Mexican policy
and declared for the protection of
American rights abroad.
"1 believe, this nation should have
the strength that proper preparedness
requires In order that we may not
stand in danger of bolng misunder
stood as to our ability to maintain
our Just rights," he said.

information.
. They did say, however, that thev
had every confidence that the state

UNEXPECTED DEMOCRATIC
REVOLT IN THE SENATE
Inauguration Bill Taken Up in Defi
ance of Democratic Caucus.
Washington, Aug. 21. An unex
pected, democratic revolt in the senate
today resulted in the immigration bill
being taken up in defiance of the
democratic caucus and opened the
way for efforts to displace the reve
nue bill ns unfinished business, an ac
tion which might indefinitely prolong
the session of congress.
en democratic senators voted with
the solid republican minority to take
up the immigration bill upon a mo
tion by Senator Smith of South Caro
tor Smith of South Carolina, chair
man of the immigration 'committee.
They were Ashurst. Beckham, Cham
berlain. Culberson Hp rd wick. Lane
Myers, Overman, Smith (S. C.) and
Va rdaman.
Debate began on the measure im
mediately and proceeded until 2 o'
clock, when the revenue bill auto
matically came before the senate.
Senator Smith then moved to displace
the revenue bill, provoking an all
afternoon discussion which wUl be
resumed when the senate meets to
morrow. Administration leaders said tonight
that they had enough votes U defeat
the fmith motion. Even some of the
revolting democrats have declared
their intention of voting against it.
Should it prevail, the resulting fight
over the literacy test provision would
upset all adjournment calculations.
Senator Stone, chairman of the for
eign relations committee, was uar
ticularly aroused over the action of
the revolters. He charged them with
treachery to the party in overturning
the decision of the democratic caucus
to postpone action on the immigra
tion bill until December.
GOMPERS REPLIES TO
SENATOR SHERMAN'S CHARGES
Declares Senator Will Have Further
Reason to Consider Him a "Public
Nuisance."
Orange,- N. J., Aug. 21. Addressing
the thirty-eighth annual convention
of the New Jersey Federation of La
bor here today, Samuel Gompers, the
president of the American Federation
of Labor, replied to the speech made
in the United States senate recently
by Senator Lawrence Y, Sherman of
Illinois. It was President Gompers'
first public answer to Senator Sher
man and he concluded by promising
that the senator would have further
reason to consider him a "public nui
sance."
President Gompers in his address
said he was not "the temporary head
of the -American Federation of La
bor," as Senator Sherman is reported
to have said, but had been its presi
dent for thirty-two years. Referring
to funds raised in behalf of the In
dianapolis dynamiters, the labor lead
er said:
"When they pleaded innocent we
went down in iur pockets so that they
might have a fair trial. When they
pleaded guilty we abandoned the
whole thing. That's the extent of our
wrongdoing."

Militia Border
Service Indefinite
UNTIL AMERICAN LIVES ARE NO
LONGER ENDANGERED
SECT. BAKER DECLARES
Says Guardsmen are Performing a
Valuable Service, and It is Impossi
ble to Forecast When Time of Their
Withdrawal.
Washington, Aug. 21, The national
guard will be retained on the Mexican
border until it can be withdrawn
without again endangering American
lives and property. Secretary Baker
so declared the administration's poli
cy today in answering a score of let
ters from many parts of the country
complaining that the state troops
were in service after the emergency
for which they were called out appar
ently had passed.
Secretary Replies to Complainants.
In general ,the complainants whose
names were withheld, alleged the bor
der service was entailing loss finan
cially on militiamen and hardships on
their families. The secretary replied
to all those seeming to merit atten
tion. By the presence on the border, he
wrote, to one, the guard is "winning
bloodless victories daily." He de
clared that Americans resident along
the international line were enjoying a
peace and security they could not
know without the military forces to
protect them.
The department appreciates, Mr.
Baker said in another letter ,the fact
that a call for military service upon
militia organizations must "inevitably
present cases of hardship." He add
ed: Emergency Was of Grave Charactre.
"The emrgency, however, which re
quired this call for the militia was
one of a grave character, effecting the
safely and lives of citizens . of the
United States men, women and chil
dren. The presence of the militia on
t ie Mexican border has restored or
Jer and given a higher degree of
safety and security to the lives of our
people in that troubled country thnn
they have for a long time had. The
militia is therefore performing a val
uable service; and the fact that this
service is being performed without
active military operations entailing
loss of life to our soldiers, is a cause
of congratulations and happiness."
Fit Men for Service.
Referring to the elaborate and ex
tensive training the militiamen are
receiving under supervision of regular
army -omcers, the secretary expressed
the opinion that it would fit them to
act in time of war or other emer
gency as a supporting arm, or second
line, for the regular army, furnishing
an asset to national preparedness that
could not have been obtained other
wise. Impossible to Forecast Recall.
"Clearly, soon as a restored state of
order on the border justifies it, these
troops will be returned to their
homes," he wrote. "In the meantime
It Is not possible for the department
to say how soon such a situation will
arise, although the Mexican situation
is one of increasing hopefulness.''

RAILROAD EXECUTIVES HOLDING OFF
Not Willing to Accept Plan Proposed by President Wil
son in Its Present Form
COUNTER-PROPOSITION
As One American Citizen to Another President Wilson Yes-,
terday Appealed to the Magnates, on the Ground of
Patriotism, to Accept His Plan to Avert a Strike Rail
road Heads Maintain That They Are Being Asked to'
Sacrifice the Principle of Arbitration Statement by
Officials Suggests That They Are Ready to Take What
ever Action the People of the Country Desire.
Washington, Aug. 21. As one Amer-1
ican citizen to another, President Wil
son today appealed to ich of the ex
ecutives of the country's principal rail
roads, on grounds of patriotism, to ac
cept his plan for averting the threat- 1
ened disaster of a nation-wide strike.
He emphasized the necessity for keep
ing the railroads in service as a part
of the national defense and to make
possible preparation for meeting con
ditions that will exist after the Euro
pean war.
Hope for Counter Proposition.
On leaving the White House the
railroad presidents, augmented during
the day by arrivals from the west, held
a conference at which sentiment was
said to be against agreeing to the
president's proposal in its present
form. Hope was expressed, however,
that some satisfactory counter-proposition
might be advanced, and it was
decided to turn over to a committee
the task of drafting a final reply to
the president.
The railroad heads still insist that
President Wilson is asking them to
sacrifice the principle of arbitration.
Elisha Lee, chairman of the national
conference committee of railways, is
sued a statement tonight in which he
said:
Statement by Railway Heads.
"That the railroads should gran,
under threat of a national strike, a
$50,000,000 wage preferment to a small
minoritv of their employes without a
hearing before a public trlibunal is
inconceivable in a democracy lime our3.
All questions at issue -wages, hours,
costs, operating conditions are sub
merged by the greater issue: Shall ar
bitration be abandoned in the settle
ment of industrial disputes?"
The statement suggests, however,
that the railroads stand ready to take
whatever action the people of the coun
try desire. It concludes:
Public Opinion Must Determine Action.
"The weight of public opinion must
determine this issue. We cannot be
lieve that it is the calm judgment of
the country that we should sacrifico
the principle of arbitration in indus
trial disputes, under a threat to tie up
the commerce of the country."
AVhile the omciais were usiemns .-
Prerident Wilson and later conferring
at their hotel, the general committee of
640 representatives of the men, who
have alreadv accepted the pqresident s
plan, hel da perfunctory meeting and

the employers. They said they would

thorn, but stood ready to call a strike
should the negotiations fail.

ecutives "invited had not arrived this

nied Other Demands.

MAY BE ADVANCED
afternoon, it was decided that those
already in Washington were represent
ative and therefore the president call
ed them to the White House and ear
nestly urged that his plan of settle
ment be reaffirmed.
President Wilson's Appeal.
"I will not allow passion to come into
my thoughts in this solemn matter,"
he saiQ. "We are both acting as trus-'
tees of' great interests. I am willing
to allow this matter to go to the great
American jury and let them assume the
responsibility. The responsibility of
failure will not rest with me.
"I wish yon to consider the conse
quences as affecting the people of the
cities and countrysides of a failure to
agree. The country cannot live if the
means of keeping alive its vitality are
interfered with. The lives and for
tunes of 100,000,000 men, women and
little ones many of whom may die
depend upon what may be done in this
room. I appeal to you as one Ameri-.
can citizen to another to avert thlsl
disaster."
The president spoke in more intimatei
fashion than he has in any of thai
previous conferences. He referred to
diasstrous effect which a strike would
have, "especially at this time, when
every ounce of American energy and;
initiative has to be mobilized to meet;
the extraordinary situation which Willi
emerge out of the European war.'"
Practical Methods Advocated.
Reiterating that it was imposstbfci
for him to bring about arbitration un
der present conditions, the president
declared it was necessary to li3cuaHI
practical methods of averring a strikeJ
The war, he said, had taught thiol
country that it can no longer reroaini
isolated and provincial: that by roosonJ
of Its position in the affairs of th
world "we must be ready to play ottri
role as one of the dominant InfluenCasj
in the world's affairs," and that in orM
der to meet the exigencies of newi
world conditions the varied businessj
and economic interests of the nation!
must be brought together into an har-i
monious whole. j
"Our great national resources can-
not be made available or mdbilized ihf
this emergency as a necessary part of;
national defense," ho added, "unless1
the railroads are made serviceable in-;
strumentajities for backing up any'
plan of national preparednss."
Was No Argument.
The railroad executives did not en-,
t9r into an argument with the presi-l
dent, but Hale Holden, president of the!
Burlington and spokesman for the:
roads, promised deep consideration of
the plan and said the officials would;
sefk to reach an agreement as soon as
possible. ,
