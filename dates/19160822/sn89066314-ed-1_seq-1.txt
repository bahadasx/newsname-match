WASHINGTON, Aug. 22. The
greatest industrial struggle in the his
tory of the country hangs in the bal
ance today.
The question of acceptance or re
jection of the proposals made by
President Wilson in an effort to avert
a striKo tnat would lie up tne rail
roads of the country has now been
passed to the men whose money is
invested in the great arteries of the
nation's trade.
As the .situation stands this after
noon the employers have put their de
mands for an S-hour day and time and
a half for overtime in the hands of
the President.
Me has put it up to the heads of
the railroad presidents and they in
turn have passed it on to the direc
tors.
After an all-night session the joint
committees of "big barons' appointed
by two score executives failed to
reach any definite decision today.
They wired their directors, and
upon the replies from the money pow
ers largely rests the final result.
In the meantime the high salaried
railroad executives continued to wres
tle with the various executives. Count
ing the salaries and expenses of the
various railroad heads and union of
ficials, the negotiations are costing
between $25,000 and $30,000 a day, it
is estimated.
There is no doubt that a division
exists among the railway heads, one
faction favoring "trading" with the
President in accepting the S-hour day
principle, the other violently opposed
to any step against their stand de
manding arbitration on all matters.
A short sesison attended by all of
the two score railroad presidents was
held during the morning but adjourn
ed at 1 o'clock until C this evening.
CIHIS COXIUTIOX IS CRITICAL
.Miss Cora readier Xo Hotter Reiiinl
of Humored Wedding Sunday.
.Miss Cora Peachcr, injured last
night in a runaway, is still in a criti
cal condition. Her skull was frac
tured at the base but just how se
riously it is as yet impossible to say.
The other victim of the accident, Miss
Josie Benton of Holla, a guest of .Miss
Poacher's, is still suffering from the
shock, but has no serious injuries.
The young ladies, with Clyde Val
entine, were driving near the fair
grounds, when the horse became
frightened and ran away. The girls
were thrown out of the buggy and
knocked unconscious. They were
taken to the home of Jack Frost on
North boulevard. Mr. Valentine was
uninjured.
When seen this morning, Mr. Valen
tine denied that Miss Poacher and he
were to have been married next Sun
daj night. He would not deny that
they were engaged, however.
Miss Poacher resided with her sis
ter Anna at the home of Policeman
P. T. King on Washington avenue.
Her mother and father live on a farm
near Murray. She has been employed
by the Columbia Telephone Company
but quit her position last week.

.11. C. Graduate Is Visiting His
ltrollier, J. Kelly Wright.
Turner H. Wright, a graduate of the
College of Agriculture in 1909, is in
Columbia visiting his parents, Mr.
and Mrs. P. M. Wright, and brother
J. Kelly Wright.
Wright, after his graduation, was
assistant professor in animal hus
bandry in the University of Kansas.
In 1913 he became livestock editor
of all the Capper farm publications.
Two years later he resigned this po
sition and was appointed by the Gov
ernment a member of the Iitireau of
Markets in the United States. Dcpart
ir.rnt of Agriculture. As a member of
this bureau, Mr. Wright is in Baton
Houge, La., in co-operation with the
Louisiana State College of Agricul
ture, inspecting the livestock market
of the south.
About three years ago, Mr. Wright
was married to .Miss Helen Hoobbs
of Kau Claire, who was a teacher in
the home economics department in the
Kansas State University.
Cost of Improving Lee School Is Con
sidered Too (.'real.
Because they could not consider
abandoning the purchase of adjacent
lots for enlarging the grounds of the
Lee School, the school board last
night rejected the bids for Improving
the building. After much discussion
the board were deadlocked over the
proposition and will take it up at an
other meeting tonight.
The lowest bids were $S,C09.10 by
I. L. Davis for the building and $9S5
by the Columbia Heating and Plumb
ing Company for the plumbing and
heating with $72.40 extra in case of
metal ceilings and $233 extra in case
of a thermostatic heat-control device
being put in. The bids were not con
sidered excessive, but it was thought
best to postpone action because of the
limited funds and the extensive im
provements this summer in the way of
additional school grounds and two
new buildings.
The board set September 15 as the
day for opening bids on the school
at Range Line and Smith streets. The
school is to be finished by June 1,
1917. Several accounts were allowed

He was on the University freshman

Last spring he pitched a no-hit game

JEFKKRSOX CITY, Mo, Aug. 22.
When Ihe Republican and Democratic
platform conventions were called to
order hero shortly after noon the pre
dicted fight for the Republican state
chairmanship began, but the threat
ened row in the Democratic ranks
over the selection of a state chairman
fell by the way side.
James Cowgill of Kansas City is
the new state Democratic chairman.
Earlier predictions were that the
Jefferson City contingent, headed by
Auditor Gordon, would fight to pre
vent the selection of the Kansas City
man, who has the support of Colonel
Gardner and Senator Heed, but when
the committee met there were but
three votes against Cowgill.
Following the usual opening cere
monies, the Democratic platform com
mittee went into session.
The platform builders were busily
planing down planks for the state
document.
An endorsement of the present state
administration and a recital of its ef
ficiency will be included in the plat
form, which is to be drafted sometime
later this afternoon.
Gardner outlined the principal
planks. He said good roads, a revis
ion of the civil code, better educa
tional facilities, an indorsement of the
workmen's compensation act, the land
bank bill and a complete and specific
endorsement of the Wilson adminis
tration will be planks in the docu
ment. He would not discuss the tax-ad
justment problem, stating he believed
his statement as to specific recom
mendations covered the point suf
ficiently. John E. Swanger of Sedalia, de
feated candidate for governor, is lead
ing the fight in the Republican ranks
to name the state chairman. Judge
Lamm, who defeated him for the gub
ernatorial nomination, wants Jeptha
Howe, former St. Louis Republican
boss, and, according to his friends.
will resign unless his choice prevails.
Swanger is backed by Walter S. Dick
ey, senatorial candidate, in his fight
on the St. Louis former boss.
Just what planks the Republican
platform would contain could not be
learned, but it is believed practically
certain it will contain a home-rule
plank for the larger cities.
The Republican committee was
hopelessly deadlocked on the state
chairmanship question when the con
vention was called to order.
There was no indication as to the
nature of the Republican platform.
A notable feature of the political
gathering here today is the absence
of the drys were on hand but they
of the drys wcer on hand but they
were not openly advocating the inclu
sion of dry planks in cither of the
state platforms.
Sjffrage workers, however, were
out in number, buttonholing politi
cians. It Is not thought likely that
either party will include a suffrage
plank to Its platform.
John 31. Bothwcll of Sedalia was
brought forward as the compromise
candidate in the Republican scrap for
state chairman. It is thought Both
well will be favorable to Lamm.
