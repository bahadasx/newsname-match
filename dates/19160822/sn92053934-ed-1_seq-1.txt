An official German report says that
a submarine which was rammed after

decided when all the reports of sub

tingham and Falmouth by German
submarines in the Xorth sea on Sat

submarine was destroyed and that an
other was rammed and possibly sunk.
"Regarding British attempts to deny
that a British destroyer was sunk and
a British battleship damaged." th?
statement says, "we refer to the offi
cial German report of Aug. 20 which
la maintained In all points.
"The alleged retreat, as Ftated in
the British admiralty report of the
German high sea fleet, before which
the Gritish high sea forces now here
appeared, is imaginative."
It was also said the German high

Urged Upon
Federation
New York, Aug. 22. Bishop P. J.
Muldoon of Rockford, 111., at the wom

tion of Catholic Societies, in session
here today, urged about 200 delegates
to join every state, county and city
civic movement in their communities.
"Don't stand back and say, 'We Cath
olics women are not wanted and won't
get a fair chance,' " he said. "My own
experience is that people of other be
liefs not only are fair to us Catholics
but are most anxious for us to join
with them in their work for the gen
eral good. It is only too true, I am
sorry to say, that we Catholics have
not done our part in social service
work.
"Join every movement for the public
good and express the Catholic soul that
is in you and show your community
that Catholic thought is the real, com

GUARD OH BORDER
SERVING PURPOSE
Secretary Baker in Reply to Letters
Praises Splendid Spirit and
Efficiency of Soldiers.
Washington, Aug. 22. Belief of the
administration that the national guard
on the border still is serving the defi
nite purpose of preventing bandit
raids, was evident today in answers
sent by Secretary Baker to persons
who had written suggesting that the
troops be recalled.
The secretary referred to hardships
caused guardsmen and their families
by the enforced stay at the border as
a regrettable but necessary accom
paniment of the service. He explain
ed also that the training would be in
valuable in aiding the men to act as
a second line in war time.
Secretary Baker's letters praised
the spirit and efficiency of the men
and promised that they should be re
turned, "so scon as a restored state of
order on the border justifies it."
THE WAR TODAY
The offensiTp in the Balkan is
in full swing with Russian troops
arriving in Saloniki to tight with
the entente forces and Rumania
reported about ready to enter the
war on the side of the allies.
Landing of Italian troops who
are also to take part in the Balkan
operations is continuing. An un
official dispatch also reports that
Greek troops have been engaged
with Bulgarians in the vicinity of
Seres.
Athens advices Indicate that Kns
sian troops hare been in the Bal
kans for more than three weeks.
Arrival of the Russian's at Sa
loniki. together with yesterday's
ojinouncement that Italian troops
had landed there, is another indi
cation that the allies have decided
to concentrate on this front forces
sufticient for an important cam
paign. It is only about ."50 miles in an
air line from Russia to Greece at
the nearest point, but Rumania and
Bulgaria lie between, and to bridge
the distance the Russians were
obliged to travel thousands of
miles. As the Bosphorus is closed
by the Turks they were deprived of
the short sea route. The Russian
troops which were sent to France
earlier in the war, made a journey
of approximately 17.500 miles,
traveling to Port Dalny, Manchu
ria, overland and thence by water
via the Suez canal and the Medi
terranean. Since the White sea
is open at. this season it is possible
that the Russians traveled by the
Atlantic route and reached Salon
iki by way of Gibraltar and the
.Mediterranean.
Today's dispatches Indicate that
the engagement on the 3Iacedonian
front is becoming general all along
the 150-mile line. Immediately
north of Saloniki, in the Doiran re
gion, Serbian troops are reported
to have captured two forts, while
in the heaviest fighting reported
on the left bank of the Struma, the
Antrlo-French forces are attack
ing the Bulgarians northwest of
Seres.
On the western end of the line
the Bulgarians claim notable ad
vances, some of which are con
ceded. They have pressed south
ward from Fiorina, occupying
Kastoria and Koritsa.
For the moment at least opera
tions on the eastern and western
fronts are overshadowed by those
In the Balkans. The French have
resumed Infantry activity along
the Somme, capturing trenches
near Fstrees and Soyeeourt, south
of the river. They have also made
progress fn the outskirts of Clery.
Renewed reports are heard that
Rumania intends to enter the war
on the side of the entente allies.
Taken in connection with the
opening of the allied offensive at
Saloniki, a large part of the Ger
man press believes the reports are
true and that plans are being
made for the march of a Russian
army throuirh Rumanian territory.
Rumania already has a splendid
army of more than half a million,

Washington, Aug. 22 President Wil
son let it be known today that he
would veto the immigration bill If it
came before him again with the liter
acy test and with that the senate de
feated the motion to take up the meas
ure and returned to consideration of

rived just when the democrats were
continuing their party row over the
action of the nine revolting democrats
who refused to be bound by the cau
cus which decided to let the bill go
over.
Five of the revolting democrats
promptly turned about and voted
against the motion to take it up. They
were Senators Beckham, Chamberlain,
Culberson, Lane and Overman. They
made the vote 32 to 23.
Senators Ashurst, Hardwick, Myers,
Smith of South. Carolina, and Varda
man, all democrats, 6tuck to their vote
to take it up however.
The senate's action means efforts to
consider the bill at this session prob
ably will be dropped.
PROBE FOR BANKS
LIKELY TO START

Silver & Company.
Chicago, Aug. 22. Federal Investi
gation into the two private banks of
Adolph Silver and company, which
failedto open Saturday, will be made
to ascertain if federal statutes have
been violated, Charles F. Clyne, Uni
ted States district attorney, announced
today after a conference with Judge
Landis of the L'nited States district
court here.
Mr. Clyne said there were two laws
under which he could start prosecu
tion concealment of assets under the
bankruptcy law and violation of the
postal laws If it were found that de
posits had been solicited by mail while
the banks were known to have been
insolvent.
Four Russians living In Davenport,
Iowa, came to Chicago today to de
mand an explanation from the Silvers.
They were astonished when the found
the banks closed. K. W Kaprielow,
owner of a foundry near Davenport,
said he had entrusted Silver with $750
to forward to his wife in Russia. Sam
pad Khazarow had entrusted the bank
er with $350. Megerdicz Grogorow with
$258 and Averod Utirtileff with $64.
Utirlleff said the amount he asked to
be sent to his wife was for transpor
tation to this country.
Federal Judge Landis, who appoint
ed the Central Trust company of Illi
nois receiver for the DanKs, declared
corrupt politics was the cause for fail
ures of private banks, saying it was
the result of corruption in the legisla
ture, downstate banking Influence and
backing by certain Chicago bankers.
"I shall do what I can to smash this
crowd of corruptionists," Judge Landis
said.
While search was continued for Max
Silver, manager of the banks, who has
been missing since Saturday, safe ex
perts opened the vault. Owners of
safety deposit boxes crowded around
the institutions to learn if their money
and papers was still in the boxes.
Little more than $1,000 was found in
a safety deposit box of Max Silver,
when it was opened today. In a larger
box used by the bank currency, was
found more than $2,000. One of the
500 boxes in the vault was found to
have been. "Jimmied."

ROAD STRIKE 1
STILL HOLDS .
ON DEADLOCK
President Wilson Firm for
Granting of an Eight
Hour Day.
CONGRESS MAY ACT.
Presidents of Sixty Roads
Now at Capital to Meet
With Executive.
Washington, Axsg. 22, While
the railroad executives were work
ing today on a counter proposal to
President Wilson's plan for avert
ing the threatened railway strike,
the cabinet went over the situa
tion fully and confidence was ex
pressed by members that the rail
roads would accept the president's
plan.
What assurances the cabinet
had to go on for snch a conclu
sion were not disclosed. Cabinet
members agreed that It was net
feasible to hurry the rallnwul
executives Into a decision.
While the executive committee
worked on the counter proposal,
the other presidents had confer
ences among themselves which
developed in their views.
One president, the head of a
large system, said he had no
doubts as to his action If only his
own line was involved, but that
others had to be considered. An
other said the situation might
finally result in each road mak
ing Its own arrangements.
All, however, expressed hope of
an arrangement in w hich all could
participate.
tvashlngton,' Aug. 22. As the rail
road executives were not ready for an
other conference this morning, Presi
dent Wilson called the cabinet to dis
pose of accumulated business.
While the committee was working
the executive got in touch with their
boards of directors. It was understood
a reply might be ready for President
Wilson tonight or tomorrow morning.
The exact nature of the proposal to be
submitted to President Wilson was not
revealed, but the conclusion was
drawn that it concerned the conces
sion of the eight-hour day.
One suggestion understood to be un
der consideration was the submission
of the collateral Issues to the Inter
state commerce commission or a pro
vision for making permanent the com
mission of Investigation suggested by
President Wilson.
The brotherhood meeting did noth
ing and adjourned until 3 o'clock this
afternoon. An invitation from Vice
President Marshall to all of the repre
sentatives to visit the senate today was
accepted.
Brotherhood Goes Into Session.
At 10 o'clock this morning the men
went into a meeting attended by lead
ers of all four brotherhods. The lead
ers said it was Just to keep the men to
gether. Brotherhood officials de
scribed the situation as unchanged.
The railroad executives announced
that consideration of the situation had
been turned over to a committee of
eight, as follows: Hale Holden, Bur
lington; W. W. Atterbury, Pennsylva
nia; Fairfax Harrison, Southern; Rob
ert S. Lovett, Union Pacific; E. P. Rip
ley, Santa Fe; A. 11. Smith, New York
Central; Frank Trumbull, Chesapeake
and Ohio; Daniel Wlllard, Baltimore
and Ohio.
Railway Heads Oppose President.
The answer of more than sixty rail
road presidents, including those of
western roads newly arrived, to Presi
dent Wilson's proposed plan for avert
ing the threatened strike was being
formulated today. Every utterance of
the railway heads displayed opposi
tion to the president's suggestion, but
It was considered possible a counter
proposal acceptable to the employes
would be made as the basis for further
negotiations.
The employes' committee of 640 con
tinued to mark time and considered is
suing a statement refuting charges of
the railway heads that the president's
settlement plan would provide virtu-
ally a 25 per cent wage Increase rather
than an eight-hour day.
A statement issued by tho railroad
executives said It was impossible to
believe public opinion would favor giv
ing up the principle of arbitration and
granting of $50,000,000 Increased
wages to one-seventh of all railway
employes who belong to the union
brotherhoods, "without a hearing be
fore a public tribunal."
Petitions bearing signatures of 80,
000 employes not members of the
brotherhood, protesting against a
strike, were on file at the White house
today.

accept the eight-hour day proposed by
