SUTTON
HARTLEY
Senator W. J. Sutton, for all
that he is a mild sort of a person,
is even a bigger menace for the
peace and prosperity of the state
than Representative Roland H.
Hartley, the noisy opponent of
the union label, who is also a can
didate for Governor.
The two —Sutton and Hartley
—were members of the last legis
lature. Their records are like
two peas in a pod, and summed
up in a nutshell, their records
show them to be ENEMIES OF

TIONS.
To Hartley's credit be it said, he Km
been frank about it. He attacks union
labor "agitators/* as he terms them. He
boasts he will hare nothing to do with
the union label.
SUTTON IS -PUSSYFOOTING
But on every vote, Sutton in the senate
showed just as unfriendly attitude
against labor and social justice as Hart•
ley did in the house.
George E. Lee, Hartley and Sutton,
were alike in their support of that in
famous Senate bill No. 300, the off
spring of S. B. 46, described as "the
biggest attempted steal in any legisla
ture."
SUTTON, MOREOVER, VOTED
FOR THE REPEAL OF THE "FULL

MEASURE TO PROTECT THE PUB

school attitude in the present campaign,
SENATOR SUTTON VOTED TO LE

Sutton and Hartley voted to throttle
popular direct legislation, for the restor

to keep in step with the progress and
