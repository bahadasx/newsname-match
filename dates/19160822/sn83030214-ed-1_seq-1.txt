At his trial, when he was being

remember only a few vivid details. He
had heard shots, he said, had been too

WILLCOX WAITS ON
BOARD OF HEALTH
Fewer New Patients, but
Deaths for Day Inerease
by Thirteen.
Sixteen fewer case* of infantile pa
ral'sis were reported yesterdan than
on Sunday and thirteen more deaths.
Ycslerdaj's new -ares numbered nlne
ty-two. The deaths totalled thirty
three.
The possihility of opening the pub?
lic schools at the scheduled time Sep?
tember 11 was discussed yesterday by
the Board of Kduea'ion at a conference.
Ifl view of the gradual recession of tho
infantile paralysis epid<-mic it was de?
cided to take up the matter with the
Department of Health.
William 0. Willcox, president of the
board, took under advisement a sugges
tion that the public sch< 1 teacherg
who are out of town should not be com- j
pelled to return on September 8 m ?
case the opening of the schools, as had
been announced, does not take place
until September II. I'resident Willcox
announced Saturday that it would be ,
beneticial to thc teachers to return on
September 8, the usual time, and utilize
the intervening time by attending con
ferences and leetures at the so-called
teachers' in.stitute.
At y#atarday*l conference members
of Ihe board doubted th? merit of the
institute plan as a method of killing
time. They argued for BB extension of
the teachers' vacations. Mr. Willcox
made it clear, however, that it had not
yet been dei.nitely decided to postpone
the opening of the schools beyond the
regular time.
He said he did not wish the teacher*,
to get the impression that they might
proloag their vacations. The presi?
dent of the board was empowcred to
confer again with I?r. Haven Fmer
sor. Commissioner of H"alth, as to the
date for opening the schools. Presi?
dent Willcox said that detinite state?
ment on the subject would be made
about Sept. 1.
Present Orders Name Sept. 8.
The teachers have been instructcd to
return on Sept. 8 for the school regis
tration, which is held on the 8th, Oth
and 10th. The unoflicial conference
yesterday decided to lix the registra
tiofl datei at a later period if the
schools were not opened until Sept. 25.
The matter of the tearh-rs reiurning

Company Agrees to
Reinstate H Dis

UNION GIVES IN
ON ORGANIZATION
Arbitration Expected to
Follow To-day's Confer
ences on Wages.
The threat of a renewal of the strike
by employes of thc New York Rail?
ways Company ended yesterday after-.
noon when Mayor Mitchel obtained an
agreement from the company to rein
sta'e the fourteen men who had been
refused reemployment because they had
been convicted of misdemeanors during
the recent strike.
By thc terms of the agreement the
cases of thirty-four men sinco d:s
missid by the company on various
charges will be arbitrated. The mat?
ter of the company interfering with the
organization of its employes by the
formation of an "all in the family"
association was not pressed by the
union leaders, who waived this point
ss not important after the Mayor had
obtained from Theodore P. Shonts,
president of the company, Krank Hed- .
lay, JBBeral manager. and James L.
Quackenbush, general counsel, sn
agreement to accept thc Mayor's inter
pri'ation of the reimployment clause.
The Mayor held with the union that it
meant all men who struck -hould get
their places baek.
In conse.iuence of this agreement a :
committee of the union and Mr. Hedley
will take up to-day the question of
WagOS and working conditions, which
was to have beeB considered Saturday
under the terms of the peace treaty,
but which went over pending settle?
ment of the more urgent question.
Arbitration Kxpected.
It is expected the conference.* on :
wages and working conditions will re-'
quire several days, and thr net result
Iooked for is the refcrer.ee of the mat?
ter to arbitrators, the most optimistic
of the union men not looking for an
early agreement on all points. No dif
fieulty can be evpenenced in selecting
ar!' trators, for should tne men selected
by the o.mpany and the union fail to
a third man, he will be named,
und-r the terms of the original sfttle
roent, by (ftear S. SiraflB, chairman of
th? Public Scrvic ('ommission.
To obtaia a settlement, Mr. Mitchel,
who arrived in the city early yester

WILSON'S WARNING
Washington, Aug. 21.?
President Wilson, talking to
the railroad executives to?
day. said:
"We must be ready to play
our role as one of the dom
inant influences in the world's
affairs.
"Our great national re?
sources could not be made
available or mobilized in
this emergency as a part of
defence unless the railroads
are made serviceabie instru
mentalities for backing up
any plan of national pre?
paredness.
"I will not allow passion
to come into my thought in
this solemn matter. We are
both acting as trustees of
great interests. I am willing
to allow this matter to go
to the great American jury
and let them assess the re
sponsibility. The responsi
bility of failure will not rest
with me.
"I wish you to consider
the consequences as affecting
the people in the cities and
countryside of a failure to
agree. The country cannot
live if the means of keeping
alive its vitality are inter
fered with. The lives and
fortunes of 100,000.000 men.
women and little ones?
many of whom may die?
depend upon what may be
done in this room. I appeal
to you as one American cit?
izen to another to avert this
disaster."

Washington, Aug. 21.?Peaceful adjustment of the contro?

the executives' and managers' conference committee. Just
what changes are sought by the railroads il not exactly clear fo
the transportation orficials themselves. They expert to taki- 0 I
their coats and get down to cases to-morrow morning. What?
ever may be the outcome of this mcve. however. it la improl?
able that anything delinite will be accomplish-d for leveral
days.
The attitude of the railroad executives now is thil: There
is practically no chance of the roads accepting the President's
plan as it now stands. In the lirst place, the President tivat**
the issues involved in too general a way to admit of the roads
subscribing to it. They seek something more definito. more per?
manent. In the second place, they are not willing to abandon
their insistence upon arbitration in railroad labor oontroversiei
in general and in this case in particular.
