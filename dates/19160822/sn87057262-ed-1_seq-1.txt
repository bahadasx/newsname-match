BEADY TO TALK TRADES
Belief Grows That the Roads Will
v-.t, yield In the End and Great
Strike Will be
[By Robert J. ^Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Aug. 22.— The
Question of strike or no strike today
was in the hands of the "big barons"
of the railway world. A limited num
ber of the heads of the country's .big
gest systems had taken charge of
the situation over night.
Their answer, it appeared, was to
be the final answer to President Wil
son's proposal and personal appeal
for prevention of the most paralyzing
transportation tie-up in tha history of
the nation. They were to meet one
way or the other, the president'? dec
laration that the country's industrial
future rested in their hands. In a
secret conference at the Metropolitan
club last night, a small number of
the "big barons" of the railway
worlds, representing ltfO.GOO miles of
track and $2,000,000,000 of capital de
termined on a course of action. They
were to place it before their fellow
executives for ratification at a con
ference this morning. Opinion pre
vails that a peaceful adjustment of
,the: threatened ammrrc .crisis would
be affected.
The roads are dying hard, however.
They will not yield, it was declared
today unless they can trade with the
president and gain some offsetting
advantages, "some adequate compen
sation" for accepting what they re
gard as "a revolutionary change" in
the eight hour day.
But the very fact that many of the
small road chiefs, as well as a num
ber of the foremost railway execu
tives, have reached the stage where
they are willing to talk "trades," in
dicates the president has stirred up
what be termed "the immodite
opinion" of the railway powers.
It is now known that thu B. and O.
and the Southern railway executives
are ready to make concessions and
President Hale Holden of the Bur
lington in whose hands Louis W. Hill
has placed' power for negotiating for
the Hill lines, is opposed to un
equivocaly rejecting the president's
proposal.
On the other hand, early this morn
ing the. Pennsylvania and the New
York Central were holding out strong
against yielding the point of arbitra
tion. A majority of the great sys
tems appeared to be with them.
Throughout the night telegrams
kept pouring into the headquarters of
the executives and managers—appeals
from merchants and manufacturing
organizations in all the t'£ cities of
the country—urging the chiefs to
stand pat on the question.
Out of today's situation the belief
grows that the roads will yield in
the end.
"There will be no strike," said one
roader today. Officially he had said
the executives would "stick to the
last ditch" if public opinion "con
tinues favorable to the railways."
Privately, however, his admission
was that "they'll talk this last ditch'
business, but it is a practical cer
tainty that no strike is coming."
The informant frankly said if there
is any veering in public sentiment—
as the railways interpret it—or If
President Wilson feels the public is
with him, the executives must—and
will—yield.
There is no doubt, however, that
the roads will stand out to the end
for some concessions. They want the
president to define strongly and prac-

BERLIN, Aug. 22.—Bulgarian troops
have captured five Greek villages and
towns since the beginning of their
general offensive against the allied
forces in the Balkans, said an offi
cial statement from the Bulgarian
war office today.
The Bulgarian statement discloses
that the advance was begun because
of the activities of the allies, who
apparently were preparing for an
offensive movement.
"On account of
military
operations
of the allies in the Vardar valley, ex
tending east of the Struma and north
of Tachino lake, our left wing began
a general offensive on August 18," it
was stated.
"Bulgarian troops advanced in the
Struma valley and occupied the town
of pemirhissar (forty-six miles north
east of Salonika and ten miles Inside
the Greek frontier). After an en
gagement near the town oI Serrea, we
repulsed English and French forces
on the right bank of the iver Struma
and occupied the left bauk between
Butkova and the Tachino lakes. De
tachments between the Struma and
Mesta advanced in accordance with
orders.
"In the Vardar valley, English and
French troopB have attacked our ad
vanced positions for ten days with
out success south and west of the ness men.
town of Doiran, suffering heavy losses
from our infantry and aitillery fire.
"Our right wing, after a victory
over the Serbians near Fiorina, suc
cessfully pursued our plans. Yester
day we occupied the railway stations
of Banitza and Ekshisu on the rail
road from Salonika to Floiina and re
established railway communication
with Monastir. South of Presba lake
(extreme northwestern Greece) we
occupied the villages of Zuezdabiolit
zea and Bresnitza, thus interrupting
definitely the communications between
Goritzha and Fiorina a3 well as
Gortsha and Kosturkastoria."

OPPOSITION TO MOVE
Leaders Resent Outside Interference
In Settling the Problem Which
Has Long Been a
Dilemma.
William Philifc Simms, United
Press Staff Correspondent.]
PETROGRAD, Aug. 22.—A bill to
abolish the pale and give to Jews the
same rights as other Russian subjects,
will be introduced in the imperial
duma here when that bodjy convenes
in November.
Prof. Paul Mlliukov, leader of ttttr
cadets, so informed the United Press
today, following his return from a
visit to England, France and Italy
with other members of the Russian
house.
"This bill has the support of the
progressive party in the duma, there
fore of the majority," said Miliukov.
"It will contain three essential
parts. The first has for its object
the removal of the pale (within which
the JewB in Russia with a few excep
tions have had to make their homes)
thus enabling them to live wherever
they choose. The second will remove
some of the educational limitations
placed on the Jews and the third will
make it possible for him to choose
any profession or trade he cares to.
While abroad I had long talks
with" The Rothschilds7"bot*h"fn Eng-
the Sorbonne at Paris and other rep
resentative Jews. At the coming ses
sion I shall acquaint all the members
with what I was told. We realize
that Russia's dealings and indeed the
allies' dealings have been affected by
Russia's policy in the Jewish ques
tion."
The bill to remove the limitations
placed on Jews will not pass, how
ever, without considerable opposition.
The opponents say that the Jews
would soon have the peasants at their
mercy because- they are keener busl-
Particularly do Russian leaders re
sent outside interference in settling
the Jewish problem. Count Kokovt
sow, ex-prime minister and minister
of finance, expressed this attitude to
me in this manner:
"In the United States you force
southern people to pay taxes which
you use in huge sums to pay pensions
to northern people exclusively. But
you wouldn't like it if we refused to
have any* dealings with you until you
treated southerners just a? you treat
northerners."

ARE POPULAR
Presidential Nominee Hughes
Finds This the Best Theme
on His Campaign
Tour.
HEADED FOR HOME NOW
Been on the Road Twenty-three Days
and Has Almost USfed up Ten
Thousand Mile
Ticket.
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.
BAKERSFIELD, Calif., Aug. 22.—
Charles E. Hughes, republican presi
dential nominee, started a little more
than three weeks ago to make a ten
thousand mile campaign trip, but he
has already covered pretty nearly all
of that mileage and just began to
hit the trail back across the cont*
nent.
Speaking at several California
towns today on his war' to Saca
mento and Reno, the candidate dwult
particularly on his charge of dsrn-}
cratic inefficiency in tariff legislation.
His managers declare that he has
found this a popular theme with his
audiences.
Preparedness, too, they declare, is
also a subject of deep interest on
the Pacific coast, judging of the
volume of applause with which Gov
ernor Hughes' views on this issue
have been received. Twelve thousand
persons packed Shrine auditorium to
the doors and thronged in the streets
outside, unable to gain admission,
when Hughes spoke at Los Angeles
last night. Democratic tariff ideas
were attacked vigorously by him and
he asserted that only the European
war prevented them from wrecking
many American industries.
"I believe that regulation and sup
ervision by the government," he said
at one point, "is a mockery unless It
is just and squares with the facts. I
put that flag up in New York and I
never pulled it down—and never pro
pose to. It is a question of study
ing the facts, of analyzing the actual
conditions and coming to conclusions
that are fair.
"We have passed the time when we
had to restrict what was legitimate
in order to crush out what was
illegitimate and unfair and illegal.
We can protect ourselves against
every kind of monopolistic practice
without meddling.
"The democratic tariff would have
ruined us if it had not been for the
European war. If we are going to
have, when this war ceases, a condi
tion which will permit tho extension
of American industries and keep our
factories going, give room for our sur
plus and extend our trade, we have
got to make reasonable and wise
tariff legislation,
BO
that everywhere
throughout this country, where there
is a legitimate interest reeding pro
tection, it shall have it *nd not be
denied."
Hughes has averaged close to 75
or 100 miles a day in auto trips since
he left New York. He has probably
not walked more than two miles In
the whole twenty-three d»ys of his
journeying.
Everywhere he goes, if it 1b only a
few hundred feet, the candidate rides
in an auto.
Notwithstanding this almost utter
lack of exercise, Governor Hughes
in perfect physical condition, accord
ing to his physician.
forward, however, to a lot of moun
tain climbing, his favorite exercise,
when he reaches Estes Park, Colo.,
next "week. Mrs. Hughes, too, is
joying herself, but is getting just a
little anxious for some privacy and
quiet. Both the governor and his wiff
are somewhat homesick for their chil
dren now at Bridgehampton, N. Y„
and yesterday the candidate stole
enough time out of an exceedingly
busy day to write a long letter to his
daughter Catherine, who was nine
years old yesterday.
Hughes' itinerary today took him to

cities in the San Joaquin valley.
