His
Labor Leaders Mark Time Railroad
Heads Holding Conferences
Washington, Aug. 21. President
Wilson's week of conferences with
ranking officials of the railroads and
leaders of their employes threatening
a nation-wide strike aro believed by
all parties to the controversy to havo
brought the situation to a point where
decisive developments may he expect
ed within a few days.
While the negotiations took no ac
tual forward step, the president re
plied Indirectly to contentions of the
road officials that the principle of
arbitration would bo endangered by
his plan for putting the eight hour ha
ate day into effect whllo a commission
Investigates Its practicability and
passes upon other points at issuo. In
a telegram mado public at tho Whlto
House the president declared lie held,
firmly to arbitration as a principle, and
that his plan strengthened rather thau
weakened it He also said that some
means must be found to provent the
existing situation from ever arising
again.
The road officials, who foavo tenta
tively refused to nccept Mr. Wilson's
proposal continued conferences among
themselves. Tho labor leaders, who al
ready hae approved tho proposal,
marked time awaiting definite decis
ion from tho employers.
The president's telegram defending
bis plan was in reply In an appeal from
George Pope, president of the National
Association of Manufacturers, urging
that tho principle of arbitration be
preserved in the strike negotiations.
President's Telegram.
Tho president replied: "Allow me to
scknowledge receipt of your telegram
ef Aug. IS and to say In reply that I
hold to the principle of -arbitration
with as clear a conviction and as firm
a purpose as any, but that unfortu
nately there is no means now in ex
istence by which arbitration can be
secured. Existing means have been
tried and havo failed. The situation
must never bo allowed to rise again,
trot it has arisen. Some means must

pal delegate to tho United States, the
papal nuncio to Brazil, scores of
Wshops and other dignitaries, sev
eral hundred priests and thousands of
laymen participated here in tho cele
bration of a solemn pontifical high
mas at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Tho
occasion was tho formal opening of
tho fifteenth annual convention of the
Amorican Federation of Cathollo So
cieties and the sixty-first annual con
vention of tho National Fodoration of
German Catholics.
Seldom in tho history of the church
has thore been so notaWo a gathering
of ecclesiastics outside of Home. It
was estimated that moro thau S.000
persons crowded Into tho cathedral,
while twice as many moro congre
gated outsldo to view tho procession
which preceded tho mass.
Amci lean and papal flags wero hung
abovo tho cathedral entranco with
great streamers of yellow and whlto

be found to prevent Its recurrence, out
no means can be found" off-hand or in
n hurry or In se'acon to meet the pres
ent national emergency. What I am
proposing does not weakon or dis
credit the principles of arbitration. It
strengthens It, rather.'' It proposes
t'nrtt nothing bo conceded except the
eight hour day, to which the eco
nomic movement of the times scdms
to point, and the immediate creation
of an agency for de'tui mining all the
arbitrable elements In this case Jn the
light, not of predictions.-or forecasts,
but of established and ascertained
facts. This Is the firat stage of the di
rect road to tho discovery of the bpst
permanent basis for arbitration when
oliier means than thopu now available
lire supplied."
There were no outward develop
ments pending arrival of the addi
tional railroad executives to whom the
president sent invitations. Ropresen
tatlvps of both sides nio prepared to
remain here until the final word is
spoken and n strike Is declared or
averted.
It Is thought probable that' there
would be no further general White.
House conferences until Tuesday. Al
though the railroad executives con
tinue to maintain thoir position In op
position to the president's plan and in
favor of arbitration, admilstrntlon of
ficials express hope that ultimately
they would decde to negotiate on the
basis proposed by Mr. Wilson.
It was understood that a counter
proposal was under consideration by
the mllroad executives, but that It
r.iad not yet reached a definite stage
It was said to Include arbitration of at
least some of the points at Issue, with
tho granting of others. In tho mean
time telegrams urging the president to
Insist on arbitration arrived in large
numbers at the White House.

Senate Believes the Revenue Measure,
Designed to Raise $250,000,000 An
nually. Can Be Disposed of In Four
or Five Diys Minor Measures WIK
Be Overlooked In the Final Drive
for Adjournment.
Washington, Aug. 21. Adjourn
ment of Congress now waits only on
the passage of the emergency revenue
bill, Tepassage of the army appropria
tion bill with amendments to meet
President Wilson's veto, completion of
the general deficiency appropriation
measure and final action on a few con
ference reports, including tho govern
ment shipping bill. Senate leaders who
havo grown optimistic over the rapid
progress of legislation within the last
few das, said they would bo ready to
adjourn next Saturday If the house
could be prevailed upon to accept the
amended revenue bill without a light.
This does not seem likely, however,
and because of some discussion that
may arise over general deficiency ap
propriations Congress probably will
not be ready for the adjournment
gavel benore Sept. 1 or 2.
Fears of Indefinite delay resulting
from President Wilson's veto of tho
army appropriation bill because of Its
exemption from the military code of
retired officers and men have almost
entirely disappeared. The house will
repass the bill under special rule with
the articles of war which caused Rep
resentative Hays' objectionable amend
ment, eliminated. It will be rushed
to the senate, where the plan Is to re
insert the articles of wa nlnut. the
Hay amendment Unless nrcsent plans'
miscarry, the bill will then go to con
ference and Reprosctatlve Hay, his
Wends declare, will then surrender.
There Is a possibility, however, that
the articles of war will be thrown out
in the senate on a. point of order that
they are not germane to an appropria
tlon bill.
Discuss Revenue Bill Today.
Today the senate began discussion
of the revenue bill, designed to raise
$250,000,000 annually through income,
inheritance, munitions, liquor, corpo
ration stock and miscellaneous taxes.
Senator Simmons, chairman of the
finance committee, opened debate on
the measure and he has been assured
by Republican leaders who propose to
make the bill the target for vigorous
political assault that they can flnls..i
their attack In four or five days at the
most Some time, however, will be
taken by Democratic senators who op
pose certain features of the bill.
The recommendation for a bond Is
sue of $130,000,000 to meet expenses of
the Mexican emergency, house lead
ers say, will be accepted, having orig
inally been suggested by the ways and
means committee.
Republican and Democratic leaders
alike assert that odds and ends of
legislation still pending will be entire
ly overlooked In the final drive for ad
Journmcnt and that nothing can pre
vent congress getting away after the
revenue and general deflciecy bills aie
passed. They declaro such things as
corrupt practces legislation, woman
suffrage and tho treaty for the pur
chase of the Danish West Indies did
not have the ghost of a chance for
consideration unless unexpected de
velopmment should prolong the ses

London. Aug. 21. The German high:
teas fleet has again arvcarcd- in tho
North Sea and in a c'ash hetween Ger
man submarines and British scout
ships two British light cruisers have
been sent to the bottom. Tho war of
fice reports that one of tho subma
rines was destroyed and that another
was rammed and possibly sunk.
This Is tho first appearance in the
North Sea of strong German naval
forces since the batMe off Jutland on
May 31.
The two Britioh vessels lost were
the Nottingham, 5,400 tons, and the
Falmouth, 5.230 tons The crews of
both the ships were saved, with the
exception of 39 men. The Gcrmans
also claim to have sunk a British de
ctroyer, and damaged a battleship,
but this Is denied by London. Accord
ing to the British admiralty, the Ger
man fleet avoided an engagement with:
the main British forces and returned
to port when Its soouts reported the
approach of strong British squadrons
Fighting at Verdun.
On the western front the French?
continue to press forward In tha
neighborhood of Guillemont and Paris
reports the capture of a strongly forti
fied wood between that town and
Maurepas. In the Verdun sector lh
Germans are fiercely counter attack
ing In an effort to regain Fleury, the
loss of which they concede. The
British report the repulse of German,
counter attacks and the capture of a.
portion of trenches north of Bazentln-Le-Petit.
In the east the Russians are appar
ently centering their efforts on their
new drive toward Kovel. Berlin ad
mits that General Brusslloffs troops
have crossed the Stokhod at -one point
and Petrograd says that the Russians
have pushed beyond the river and cap
tured a series of heights on the road
to Kovel. Fierce fiqhtlng continues on
the crest of the Carpathians, where thp
Russians are battling within sight or
the Hungarian plains.
No Indication has been given, "now
ever of the strength of the force en
gaged in this region and It la uncer
tain as yet whether General Brussllofff
Is making a serious effort to lnvadcc
Hungary.
