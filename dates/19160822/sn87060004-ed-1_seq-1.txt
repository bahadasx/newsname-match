Not Much Enthusiasm
For County Institutes
There is not much enthusiasm
among teachers for the so-called
county institutes, in which teachers
are compelled to attend for a week
and listen to paid talkers for six or
seven hours a days usually in hot
weather. The programs' should be
made up of papers and discussions
by the teachers themselves, with the
county superintendents as instructors,
and two or three days -should be
enough. Hopkinsville Kentuckian.

Northwest Will Have 50,000,-
000 Bushels of Wheat for
Shipment -War Pre
vents Exports
Portland, Ore., August 21. The
three northwestern states, Oregon,
Washington and Idaho, will have
50,000,000 bushels of wheat to re
move to the Atlantic Seaboard with
in the next six months, and practi
cally no cars are in shjht in which to
move it, according to a comprehen
sive survey compiled by local rail
road men. The railroads will be ail
ed upon to provide about 38,500 cars
the average capacity of a car being
1,300 bushels,
Virtually all the grain of the North
west this year except that needed for
domestic consumption, will move"
J ustward by rail. The European war
us made it an economic impossibil
ity to plan on getting ships enough
to handle the export wheat the us
ual channel for the movement. The
railroads have themselves influenced
the proposed transcontinental haul,
by reducing the rates.
WHERE THE
STATE AUTO
TAX SHOULD GO
The State automobile tax ihould
go to keepintr up the State Roads and
if it is not sufficient it ought to be in

out the roads should pay for their
upkeep. Elizabethtown News.
CONGRESS AND THE
EIGHT HOUR LAW
Senator Kern has thrown out this
broad hint." "Congress" said he.
"may pass a law making eight hours
the limit of a days work on all rail
roads that handle interstate traffic or
operate between the states. Under
the interstate commerce clause of the
constitution, the power of congress
over interstate carriers is plenary and
the threatening controversy can be
very easily settled if congress takes
the bit in its teeth and passes a law
putting info force the eight hour day
which President Wilson finds to be
just."

HOOP SNAKE STORY
I saw a large hoop snake drink a
gallon of sweet milk out of a crock
in my spring house last week, said
our old friend Dick Smith yesteVday,
when we ssked him if there was any
thing new in Punkin Centre. The
snake then crawled out of the spring
iiouse, stuck his tail In his mouth and
rolled down the hill. Some how or
other, on account of being too full of
milk, I suppose he lost control of
himself, skidded sideways, ran into
several trees, bumped over rocks and
brought up against a large boulder at
the foot of the lull, when I arrived 1

Mammoth
Cave
LEAVING SATURDAY AUGUST 26

strortg, leave Evansville on Saturday,
Aug. 26th, on the steamer Evansville
they will start on one of the most in
teresting 412 mile river trips in this
country. Among other things they
will pass through six locks as followss.
Lock No, l at Spottsville, Lock No.
2 at Rumsey, Lock No. 3 at Roches
ter, Lock No. 4 at Woodbury, Lock
No. 5 at Massye Springs, Lock No.
6 at Brownsville. In addition to the
novelty of passing through these
locks the party will have the oppor
tunity of viewing some of the most
magnificent scenery on upper green,
river there is to be seen anywhere,
the huge masses of rocks are piled
up 200 feet bigh along the banks' of
' -'ver reminding one of some of
thIoldCasliennrn.g,andanScotU'
land described by SIf U'altgf Stott'
in Wavcrly Navels. The delightful
scenery is not alt, one of the chief
pleasures of a river trip is- t6 gather
on the'upper deck after supper and
watch the passing-scenery by moon
light while enjoying the cool river
breeze and listening to sweet strains
of music from the band below.
On these river trips everyone is al-
lowed to do as they please as long as
they please to do right. Everything
possible is done for the comfort and.
enjoyment of all and it is just like a.
big house party. If you wish to
shoot turtles off the logs, alright; if
you wish to dance, music is furnished;
if you wish to play "500'' go to it
if you wish to read, take kodak pic
tures, go in the engine room or up in
the pilot house, watch the deck hands
ride calves and pigs down the bant
into the river, you are free to do so,
and nothing is said or thought about
it, as the boat crew from Capt Wil
liams down, want you to have a good
time. When you get to the cave
your baggage is looked after and you
have nothing to do but eat breakfast
and get on your cave suit preparatory
to taking one of the routes.
If you have ever been in Mam-
moth Cave you will never forget it.
If you have never been you will al
ways regret it. It is one of the great
est of nature's many great wonders,
people come from all parts of the
country and from across the ocean to
see this wonderful subteraneous cav-
Ifn and are astonished at its magni
tude and granduer. Mammoth Cave
