BOYS ASKING
F0RJ00KS
The following letter has been re
ceived by the Commercial Club from
members of Troop H, asking that
some good books be sent to them:
Nogales, Arizona, Aug. 1G, 1910,
M. R. Hovey, Secretary
Commercial-Uoosters Club,
Logan, Utah.
Dear Mr. Hovey:
Inasmuch as some members of
Troop H, occasionally find a few min
utes which could profitably bo spent
reading, If we had the books, we
have decided and our plan has the
endorsement of Captain Woolley to
ask the Commercial Club to procuro
for us somn honks. We suggest that
jou advertise in the local rapers
stating that It any one has a book
which he has read and feels that It
would bo worth while and nppreclat
ed by tho boys here, to kindly mall
It to you to bo forwarded or elso
sent directly to Troop H.
We Jjelleve that nearly every fam
ily has a few books In tho private li
brary that are only filling spaco and
gathering duct and perhaps those
tnino books would be a sourca of en
joyment and a means of education to
tho fellows of the troop. Howevor,
ono should bo careful In his selection
of books for tho use of tho troop and
not send one that would perhaps not
bo read by tho boya living under con
ditions such as we havo hero. We
want something that will bo Interest
ing and Instructive even If wo have
only fifteen minutes a day that can
be tie voted to reading. Of course
wo reallzo that tho needed variety
will naturally bo contributed and wo
assure you that the gift shall luJccd
he- appreciated.
Thanking you again for pa3t favors
and in advance for tho ono wo now
ask, we ore, Very truly yours,
A. E. MERRILL,
NORMAN D. SALISBURY,
I. L. McALISTEU,
RAY II . CARDON,
ELMER JONSSON,
Members of Troop H.
The officers of tho club deem this
a very worthy request and will appre
ciate very much If a liberal responsw
Is made. If those who deslro to con
tribute for this causo, will leave the
books ut the Commercial Club, they
will bo Immediately sent to tho troop.

professionals will no doubt bo 'icro.
Classcl will be made so th.i local boys
may compote together on tha last day
n twenty mile champion motorcycle
race Will be run.
All the boys In tho valley under 20
may compete In the half mile bicyclo
race each day of the lair The asso
ciation win give a cash prlw fur tho
winner of each race ami Mr. N. J.
DeSanders will give a bicyclo to tho
boy winning the most n.imher of

ber of boys will compet3 for these
prizes. Tho boys will have a good op
portunity to train at the track as none
of the harness horses will be hero for
at least three weeks.
From now on tho fair grounds will
be placed In condition for thu open
ing September 27. A stronj funce
will be Placed down the hon" stretch
of tho track so there will be no
chance for accidents. Tho clough
near the track has been drained and
covered with gravel so there will bo

UNDERGROUND
WATER CAUSES
HILL JO SLIDE
There is no little concern on tho
parttorV-the farmers who Irrigate from
tho Logan and Hyde Park canal as
to when they can get water down
their canal and how much longer the
sliding of gravel Into the canal will
continue as the result of underground
water rising to the surface near the
llurtlcson homo on canyon road. The
slldo camo down Into the canal last
Friday night. All day Saturday, Sun
day and Monday men have been at
Work", trying to combat with tho slid
ing gravel in order to repair tho ca
nal. The situation Is a bad one and will
cost the canal company considerable
money beforo tho trouble Is finally
settled. Tluj wholo hill sldo seems
to bo saturated with water. There
may bo othor slides reported. There
was some contention that the water
was coming from tho stato dam, but
wo havo been Informed that Engineer
Hay West ran a line of levels to tho
dam from the point where the water
Is flowing from tho hill and has de
termined that the water level' In tho
dam is lower than where the wnter
comes out of the hill.
