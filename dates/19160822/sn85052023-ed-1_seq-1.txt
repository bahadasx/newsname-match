the state will be here seems to be
assured. Never has a country fair
been advertisd or talked of as has
the coming Stanford Fair. The K.
P. boosters have been busy every
minute of the time, and nothing will
be left undone to make it a winner
and something worth seeing every

Too Much Advertising
On County's Concrete Bridges Charge
Against Merchants.
Phillips & Phillips, local merchants
had warrants against them late last
week by County Road Engineer Mc
Kee Riffe on the charges of defacing
public property. The particular of
fense with which these well known
and popular young business men are
charged is that had their signs paint
ed upon the county's new concrete
bridge heads and abutments on the
Crab Orchard pike. Of course thev
did not know that such is an offense
against the statutes made and provid
ed for the state of Kentucky. En
gineer Riffe said that there are 15
violations of this law charged against
the local business men, who were re
leased on their own recognizance.
The Messrs, Phillips & Phillips are
hustling and progressive advertisers
in many ways and have their sierns
all over the country from which they
draw trade and say that this is the
first time any objection has ever
been made to them exploiting their
business in this wr.v.

Will Sue Stockholders
Rural Credits Receiver Says
Go Into Courts to Collect.
He'll
Steps to collect the moneys due
the Kentucky Rural Credit Associa
tion for unpaid stock subscriptions
were taken at Lexington Saturday
by Receiver R. J. Colbert, when he
began the mailing of circular letters
to all delinquent subscribers, calling
their attention to the court's order
to collect all such moneys. About
3,000 stockholders all over the state
are affected. All unpaid installments
must be paid in full or the subscriber
will be made co-defendant in an ad
ministration suit to be filed in the
Fayette Circuit Court to collect the
moneys due. In the letter Receiver
Colbert notifies the subscribers that
an expert accountant, J. C. Mahon,
is making a thorough examination of
the books to determine whether any
money has been wrongfully appro
priated by any officers or agents and
that if it appears from his report
that such funds have been improperly
expended, "I will at once institute
appropriate legal proceedings against
the parties responsible thereof."
About $467,723 in installments
past due remains to be collected be
fore a settlement can be made by the '
receiver, lhe courts opinion is that
it will be necessary to collect all the
balance due in order to place all the
stockholders on the same footing.
The amount to be paid subscribers
has not yet been determined.

Wonderful Escape
Stanford Girl Pinioned Under Auto
When It Turned Turtle.
(From Mt. Vernon Signal)
Mr. Charley Thompson, of Lancas
ter, and Miss Pattie Perkins, of Stan
ford, certainly had. a thrilling ex
perience lastr Sunfrcty, when the car
they were driving leaped over the
culvert, on the East side of town,
which is a ten to fifteen feet em
bankment. Miss Perkins was driving
the car and coming down the hill,
it seems that she lost control, but
yet she does not remember very
much about it, and at the point
when the car went over, Mr. Thomp
son remembers that he grabbed the
wheel. The car leaped about ten feet
lighting upside down with both oc
cupants pinioned under the car. Mr.
P. Q. Griffin who witnessed the ac
cident, rushed to them and, turned
the car over, to his great surprise,
yet great relief, found Miss Perkins
without injury or scratch of any
kind and Mr. Thompson's only wound
was a severe cut on the leg caused
by the glass from the wind shield.
Mr. Thompson was rushed to Dr.
Owens'-office where he was attended
by Drs. Owens and Pennington, and
is now out on crutches with a very
sore but not at all dangerous wound.
It was certainly a close call and one
that very few would want to exper
ience. The car was damaged some,
but with little work was in condition
to be driven thru to Lancaster the
next day.
William Walton Hurt
Oldest. Son of Col. Walton Injured
When Auto Took A Header.
A dispatch from Lexington to the
city papers Monday had the follow
ing interest here,' the young man be
ing a nephew of E. C. Walton, of
this city, and the oldest son of Col.
W. P. Walton, who was editor of the
I. J. for about 25 years: Lexington,
Ky., Aug. 20. William Walton, son
of Col. W. P. Walton, who is in
charge of the publicity work of the
Democratic State campaign, was bad
ly injured this afternoon when he
was thrown from an automobile,
which overturned near Versailles
while rounding a sharp curve. His
back was injured and he was thought
at first to be internally hurt, but late
to-night the attending physician at
the Woodford Hospital sair his condi
tion was hot serious. Col. Walton
and Mrs. Walton went to Versailles
immediately after the accident. .. In
the car were six others, Sarah Che
nault, who was driving; Lillian Jul
ian, Ann Patterson, Robert Jewell,
Henry Kimbrough and Lieut. W. H.
Cureton, U. S. A., of Louisville. All
were thrown out of the car and it
was only by chance that they were
not thrown under it. Slight bruises
only were suffered by them. The
automobile was badly damaged.
Members of the party say that when
Miss Chenault swerved to avoid
another car the machine skidded.
The Best Laxative.
To keep the bowels regular the
best laxative is outdoor exercise.
Dring a full glass of water half an
hour before breakfast and eat an
abundance of fruit and vegetables,
also establish a regular habit and be
sure that your bowels move once a
day. When a medicine is needed
take Chamberlain's Tablets. They
are pleasant to take and mild and

Pennington Gets Place j
Local Man Chosen Secretary of State
Election Commission.
Dr. T. W. Pennington, of Stanford
was on Saturday elected Secretary
of the State Board of Election Com
missioners. The position pays $200 a
year and the duties do 710 1 interferer
with his dental work here, his pre
sence being necessary in Frankfort
only upon the convening of the State
Election Board two. or three times a
year. Hon Rodman Keenon, Clerk
of the Court of Appeals and chair
man of the Election Board, is a
brother-in-law of Dr. Pennington, and
his vote, together with that of Hon.
T. B. McGregor, were cast for Dr.
Pennington, while Mrs. J. H. Stuart,
of Frankfort, the former secretary
received the vote of R. C. Oldham,
the third member of the board. Those
who are aware of Dr. Pennington's
splendid abilities and qualifications,
know that no one could have been
secured for the place who is better
qualified to fill it. Dr. Pennington
will go to Frankfort Friday when
another meeting of the board will
be held at which time the members
of the county election boards will
be named.
At the convening of the board on
, Saturday, certificates of election were
given to the various congressional
nominees, chosen at the recent pri
mary. Judge Flem Sampson was al
so given the certificate of nomination
in the republican appellate race over
Judge A. J. Kirk, whom Sampson de
feated by 859 votes. Following is
suance of a certificate to Judge
Sampson attorneys for Judge A. J.
Kirk, who opposed Judge Sampson
for the republican nomination for a
place on the appellate bench, said
Judge Kirk would carry his fight to
the .courts on the ground that failure
on the part of Judge Sampson to file
his statement of expenses in time
disqualifies him.

Operation Proves Fatal
Miss Helen Hocker, of Hustonville,
Passes Away In Danville Hospital.
Miss Helen Hocker died at 2 o'clock
Friday afternoon following an opera
tion for bowel trouble. Her remains
were taken to her home at Huston
ville and on Saturday afternoon were
laid to rest by those of her father, J.
Wesley Hocker, in Hustonville ceme
tery. Her pastor, Rev. A. H. Baugh.
of the Christian church, preached
an appropriate funeral sermon at the
home and the Hustonville quartette
sang several of her favorite hymns.
At the grave Miss Ruth Culbertson,
of Covington, sang "Beautiful Isle of
Somewhere." A largo number of
friends and relatives were present,
thus showing their love and esteem
for the young woman who had been
called from them at the very zenith
of her usefulness.
Miss Hocker was the youngest of
the children of Mr. and Mrs. J. Wes
ley Hocker and her entire life had
been spent in Hustonville, where she
was a general favorite. Her father
died some four years ago, but her
mother, Mrs. Josie Hocker, a sister,
Miss Lou Hocker, and three brothers,
vv. JJ., Harry and June H. .Hocker.
are left to feel keenly the loss of
child and sister. That they may be
given consolation and strength to
withstand their irreparable loss is the
prayer of their friends here and else
where. Miss Hocker joined the Christian
church when a mere girl and had
been a regular attendant at its ser
vices since. She was a splendid
worker in the Master's vineyard, tak
ing a prominent part in all church
work. She will be missed bv her co-
laborers and by the people of her
town, who have watched her grow
trom childhood to womanhood, and
who have seen naught but good in
her life, but the blow falls heaviest
on the aged mother and the sister
and brothers who adored her. In
their fearful loss they have the un
divided and unbounded sympathy of
as true and loyal friends and loved
ones as ever mortals had.
