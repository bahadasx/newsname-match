Col. Z. S. Spalding Comes From Garden Island and Son, R. P.
Spalding, From San Francisco to Settle Terms Lihue Pre
pares to Increase Capital1 Stock Conference in Governor's
Office on Water Rights and Distribution Purchase Price
Said to Be Between $1,500,000 and $2,000,000, as Fore
cast in Star-Bulletin's First Announcement in July-
Negotiations begun months ago for the outright sate of Makee Sugar
Company to Lihue Plantation Company were virtually completed yesterday
and will possible be settled in detail by the time this paper reaches its
readers.
The price is said to be in the nei ghborhood of $1,700,000, but this is
not definite. When the Star-Bulletin in July printed an exclusivt story
forecasting the sale, the guess was hazarded that the . figure would be
between $1,500,000 and $2,000,000. A Lihue stockholder acquainted with the
details said today that the Star-Bulletin's first story "had the figures
about right" and added that the price when known might be considered
high, but that the plantation's record and prospects justified it -
This deal, by which one large and
profitable Kauai sugar plantation
passes into the hands of another, not
only Is the biggest transaction of
years in plantation ownership, but is
of territory-wide importance because
It heralds the settlement of the entire
water rights, railroad and' homestead
controversy which was an Island sen
. tation a few months ago.
Cot. Z. S. Spalding, head of the
Spalding Interests and a prominent
figure oKaual for more than a gen
eration, arrived In Honolulu on the
steamer Maul on Saturday. His son,
Rufus P. Spalding, came from San
Francisco on the Sierra yesterday to
join Ms father In discussion of terms
with the Lihue directors.
Late yesterday it . was learned that
agreement on the deal had been
reached, but there remained a number
of important details to be completed.
Inquiry at the office of the Lihue
gency. H. Hackfeld d Co, brought
the response that the deal had not yet
been completed, but the Indications
were that during the day most of the
remaining points would be settled.
Rufus P. Spalding said, over the
telephone this morning that he could
cot at (hat time discuss the transae-
: lion, . Intimating that several points
remained not agreed upon. How
ever... a Ufcoie. aUxkhoUex fXamlliaz

for the statement, that the deal is so

a moral certainty. ; ; . . -.
Meeting in Governor's Office
Lihue directors and officers and
Col. Spalding, as well as terrltoria
ofifcials, met In the governor's office
this morning to discuss government
water rates and distribution. It was
denied that this meeting had any
thing to do with the Ldbue-Makee
deal, but it is admitted that there s
a close relation between the two mat
ters, as the agreement with the gov
ernment will depend somewhat upon
the relations between the two planta
Hons. If the sale is effected, the
question of water rights is expected
to be settled without difficulty.
Lihue to Increase Capital.
Late Monday a petition for amend
meat to the articles of association of
the Lihue Plantation Company was
filed in the office of Territorial Treas
urer C. J. McCarthy. The petition
askB that the company be allowed to
increase its capital stock from $2,100,-
000 to $3,000,000, and to raise the llm
it of its capitalization from $2,500,000
to $5,000,000

Honolulu is Proper Place for
Peace Conference; Indorses
; Preparedness Parade
Reading the Star-Bulletin's story of
yesterday on the suggestion of "Daily
Financial America" that Honolulu be
the site of a world-peace conference
after the war, Mayor Lane comment
zed:. ' " -' :
"Surely if there is any place in the
world especially suitable for a peace
conference it is Honolulu. Far away
from the strife of the world, in a mild,
peaceful climate, with minds at ease,
the emissaries of the governments of
the world gathered here would quickly
come to terms. ' . ;
"Honolulu's accessible position, as
suggested in the Star-Bulletin, is an
other argument for selecting it as a
site for the conference. I am sure that
every effort will be made by the citi
zens of this city to bring it here."
Relative to the proposed "Prepared
ness Parade' Mayor Lane agrees
with the suggestion that Kalakaua
Day; November 16. is a fitting time to
hold IL 'The King was a military
enthusiast, he declared. A prepar
edness parade would be an appropri
ate celebration of his birthday. It
could be held after the tribute to the
queen in the morning and before the
aquatic sports in the afternoon.
"Of course, the whole thing is up to
the army people. It should, be left
In their hands. , Once they broach the
plan I am sure every one will kokua." (

CHARLES A. RICE
QUITS POLITICS
AS A CANDIDATE
Senator and Former National
Committeeman Makes
Announcement
DOES NOT SEEK RETURN
TO LOCAL LEGISLATURE
Sets at Rest Rumors He Might
Run Again for Delegate
to Congress
Charles A. Rice," territorial senator
from Kauai, and in the race for dele
gate to Congress two years ago, is out
cf Dolitlcs this season as an active
or receptive candidate. . .
He made this announcement today
in response to questions by the Star
Bulletin, confirming . reports given
much credence during the past few
months that for the first time in
many years he will" be a candidate for
no office.!
"I am retiring from politics for two
years," said the Kauai senator, who
came to Honolulu for a brief business
trip, T will not run either for the
delegateship or for senator again."
Asked why he is not a candidate,
he said that he does not wish to go
after the j Republican nomination for
delegate this year, nor does he seek
reelection as senator because if elect
ed to the upper house of the legisla
ture he would be tied up for a four-
year term. He expects to be handling
much business during the next two
years mnd may De out of the territory
a good deal.
John H. Coney, the veteran house
member from Kauai, is a candidate
for - senator to take Rice's place And
he is said to be virtually, sure of election.-
He. will probably have no. oppo
sition for the Republican nomination
and Is likely to receive such a large
vote that he win be elected at the prl-
pmafies. - r"
y Rice .was Republican ' national com
mitteeman during the last term, being
succeeded 1 by Robert YCV Breckons.
With the definite announcement
that Rice Is not a candidate for the
delegateship. it looks as if there will
be no opposition to the renomination
of Prince Kuhto by the Republicans,
and so far no Democratic aspirant
has announced himself. I L. Mc
Candless has given no definite state
ment of his intentions but Democratic
observers say they do not tblnk he
win run.
McCarthy, Wilder and laukea
Being Mentioned for the
Bourbon Delegateship.
With National Committeeman John
H. Wilson declaring emphatically that
he will not be in the race that he
will not even . consider being a can
didate, the situation arising out of
the present lack in the Democratic
party of someone to put forward for
the delegateship is becoming almost
acute. ' . ' V
In about tvo weeks from now no
minations for all offices will close and
between now and then the party must
put someone forward as candidate for
oe legate for Congress. Some of the
old-timers were sure that Wilson would
consider the nomination should Mc
Candless decline to run. but Wilson
only laughs and i declares there Is
"nothing doing." He says it would be
too expensive; and besides, his busi
ness demands his. presence in Hono
lulu. Seen today after a friendly confer
ence .with District Attorney S. C.
Huber, McCandless declined to say
whether he will or will not be a can
didate for the delgateship.
"We are talking over the matter
now," he sald "and ought to reach
a decision within a few days."
Democrats are "up in the' air," so
to speak, in the matter of a candidate
If McCandless Is not to run. Those
who had faith In Wilson's stepping In
to fill a possible breach are, they de
clare, at a loss as to wha to do
next
Charles McCarthy, territorial trea
surer, is mentioned as a candidate,
but it is pointed out that he is dis
qualified because he holds a territorial
office. Col. Curtis P. laukea is also
mentioned; so is Judge Arthur A. Wil
der. However, a majority of the Bour
bons seem to feel confident that Mc
Candless will " announce . his candi
dacy within a few : days. Such an an-
nouncement will, phcourse, elieve the
situation. k
But thus far McCandless is non-
committal.

A battered whaleboat awash on the

of the five emlsted men from Fort
Shafter who have been missing since
July 15.
On that date they took a l?-foot
whaleboat, equipped with auxiliary
engine and sail, from Puuiki. Waialua,
and were to bring It around Kaena
Point and into Pearl Harbor, oince
then no tidings have come from the
five men and an army board of in

findings being sent to Washington.
Yesterday a good-sized whaleboat
came from the sea to the Kailua reef,
an eighth of a mile from shore, and
telephone reports today said that the
craft was still on the coral barrier.
It is lying upside down on the reer
and so firmly wedged there that Ha
waiian who went out in a skiff could
not turn it over. The boat appeared
to be entirely empty.
This morning two Honolulu men,
Charles F. Merrill and Superintendent
Alexander Pratt of the Rapid Transit
went out in a skiff but could get -no
closer to the boat than 100 feet ow
