London, Aug. 22. Greek and Bulgarian forces have
clashed in the region of Serres and fighting has been goT
ing on since Monday morning, said an Exchange Tele

have been killed.
The Greek commander is summoning all neighboring
reserves.

a position a few miles north of Serres, forty miles north
east of Salonika. The last official dispatches reported
French forces attacking this Bulgar detachment at
Barakli.
On the whole front the allies are now attacking the
Bulgarian lines, the engagements developing into a series
of battles. In the center the allies have pressed forward
in the Doiran lake region in a preliminary movement to
ward Strumnitza in southwestern Bulgaria.
Montenegrin troops are fighting beside the Serbs on
the allies' right wing. A small Montenegrin detachment
repulsed a Bulgarian cavalry attack at Fiorina on Sun
day. Official dispatches to the French war office report
that the battle is continuing in this region, where the
Bulgarians have occupied both Fiorina and Banica.
On the extreme right the Bulgarians are within a few
hours march of the Greek port of Kavala and may already
have entered the city." . .
The British war office thus far has issued no state
ment on the progress of the new operations. It is too
early to say whether the allies are really swinging for
ward in the long expected Balkan offensive or whether
the present operations constitute an energetic counter
offensive to offsejt the Bulgarian attacks.
Increasing activity of the pro-war party in Rumania
was reported today, though Berlin dispatches repeated
that Germany is not uneasy over the present situation in
the Balkans. The Greek cabinet thus far has taken no
decisive step to counter on the Bulgarian invasion.

Berlin, Aug. 22. Bulgarian troops
have captured five Greek villages and
towns since the beginning of their gen
eral offensive against the allied forces
in tho Balkans, said an official state
ment from tho Bulgarian war office to
day. The Bulgarian statement discloses
that the advance was begun because of
the activities of the allies, who appar
ently were preparing for an offensive
movement.
"On account of militnry operations
of the allies in the Vardar valley, ex
tending cast of Struma aud north of
Tachino lake our left wiug began a gen
eral offensive on August 18," it was
stated.
"Bulgarian troops advanced in tho
Struma valley ami occupied the town
of Demirhissur (4S miles northeast of
Salonika and 10 miles inside the Greek
frontier). After an engagement near
the town of Si-hlies, we repulsed Knglish
and French forces on the right bank of
the Struma and occupied the left bauk
between Butkova and the Tachino lake.

French troops have attacked our ad

Chicago, Aug. 22. Cooling winds
brought relief to Chicago and the mid

rary, according to the weather bureau,
which Bays that warm weather will re

it was said, would remain in the 80 's
all day and possibly go as low as (35

A shortago in ice was averted today
by the cooler weather. Ice companies
reported that about 150 carloads of ice,
duo to arrive here today from Illinois,
Wisconsin and Minnesota lakes, failed
to do so, because of ice workers at the
lakes "laying off" on account of the
heat.
Men were hired here today and rush
ed to the lakes and the situation is
expected to be relieved tomorrow. There
will be no increase in the price of ice.

TO
Shoot School Teacher, Steal
His Team and Travel 120
Miles Before Caught
Twin Falls, Idaho, Aug. 22. A mur
der charge may be filed today against
Lynn Lovelace, aged 11 years, who is
alleged to have shot and killed Profes
sor F. T. Hnmill, of Carson City, Ncv.,
on his ranch 45 miles from hero August
15. Haroid Lovelace, aged 12, will prob
ably be held as an accomplice. The
coroner's jury, after inquiring into
Hamill's death, returned a verdict fiud
ing he was killed by a bullet from a
rifle in the hands of Lynn Lovelace.
Juvenile officers are bundling the case,
however, and it is not likely the boys
will ever be brought to trial.
According to information in posses
sion of the sheriff, the two boys were
left by their mother and stepfather in
care of neighbors, while thu mother
went to Boise and the stepfather to Col
orado. In the absence of Hnmill from
his homestead nearby, the lads went to
his house to steal, and were surprised
there by his unexpected return.
It is alleged that they barricaded
themselves in the house and threatened
Humill with his own rifle. Finally ho
persuaded the older boy to come out,
seized him and holding him as a human
shield, advanced upon Lynn, who hold
the gun.
Then, the authorities assert, I.yno
fired. The bullet grazed his brother'!
head and struck Hnmill in tho eye, kill
ing him instantly. The boys loaded
Hamill's wagon with supplies and weap
ous and started on a 120 mile drive over
rough and barren country, slecninir in
jthe sagebrush. They were apprehended

Bakersfield, Cal., Aug. 22. Charles
E. Hughes, republican presidential
nominee, started a little more than three
weeks ago to make a 10,000 mile cam
paign trip but h has already covered
pretty nearly all of that mileage and
just began to hit the trail back across
the continent. ;
Speaking at several California towns
today, on his way to Sacramento and
Reno, the candidate dwelt particularly
on his charge of democratic inefficiency
in tariff legislation. His managers de
clare that he has 'found this a popular
theme with his audiences. Preparedness,
too, they declare, is also a subject of
deep interest on the Pacific coast, judg
ing from the volumo of applause with
which Governor Hughes' statements on
his issue have been received.
Twelve thousand persons packed
Shrine Auditorium to the doors and
thronged in the streets outside unable
to gain admittance when Hughes spoke
at Los Angeles last night. ' Democratic
tariff ideas were attacked vigorously
by him and he. asserted that only the
r.uropean wax prevented them -from
wrecking many American industries..
"I believe that regulation and super
vision by the government," he said at
one point, "is a mockery unless.it is
just and square with the . facts. I ,put
that flag up in New York and I never
pulled it down and never propose, to.
It is a question of studying the facts, of
analyzing the actual conditions aud
coming to conclusions that are fair.

had to restrict what was legitimate in
order to crush out what was illegitimate
and unfair. We can protect ourselves
against every kind of monopolistic prac
tice without meddling,

"The democratic tariff would have
ruined us if it bad not been for the
European war. If we are going to have,
when this war ceases, a condition which
will permit the extension of American
industries and keep our factories go
ing, give room for our surplus and ex
tend our trade, we have got to make
reasonable and wise tariff legislation,
so that everywhere throughout this
country where there is a legitimate in
terest needing protection, it shall have
it and not be denied."

Shortly before 5 o'clock the

Washington, Aug." 22. The greatest

Oregon City, Ore., Aug. 22. Villa and

terrorizing the countryside here for sev

locked up in the smoke house on the
Spulak ranch. .
Villa and Carranza are cub bears.
They were cute at first, then rapidly
grew more robust and belligerent. They

ANOTHER REVOLT
Manuel Bonilla Trying to
Unite Mexican Factions
Against Government
El Paso, Texas, Aug. 22. Declaring
De Facto President Carranza the worst
enemy of Mexico and that his rule could
result only in factional tyranny, Manuel
Bonilla, former minister of the interior
under Francisco Madero, made the first
public statement in behalf of the new
revolutionary party of "LegaliBtas"
here today.
Bonilla said that efforts were under
way to unite all Mexican . factions
against Carranza. Meantime, United
States secret service men hero ana in
Juarez are watching closely activities
of the new party.
"Tho MaderiBta faction, of which I
am a member has cast aside all differ
ences," Bonilla said. "Several of the
factions have united in a common ef
fort to free Mexico from internal trou
bles. Some of the saner elements of the
Carranzlsta party have already joined
us. We will endeavor not- to violate
the nentrality of the country which is
sheltering us now."
Bonilla has just returned from New
York where ho was enlisting aid for the
revolutionists.

The bill to remove the limitations
placed upon Jews will not pass, how-
over, without .considerable' opposition..
The opponents say that the Jews would
soon have the neasants at their merer
because they are keener business men.
Particularly do Russian Headers resent-outside
interference in settling
the Jewish problem. . Count -Kokovt-zow,

"In the United . States you force.
