Like Ants, Workmen Swarm
In Glare of Molten Metal
Yesterday Miss Abbott outlined the process of smelting the copper
which is one of the most important factors in the European war. Today
she continues the story of her trip through the Tacoma smelter.
BY MABEL ABBOTT.
The smelter is a region of sinister smells; of dust that glitters; of volcanic
■furnaces that seethe and glow; of strange baths in whose poisonous, still, green
depths huge slabs of metal waste like wax, and sheets of pure copper grow like
live things; a region of solid rock where once the sea was 40 feet deep; of tres
tles and tramways and ropes; of net works of track where deformed locomotives
lunge and lurch; and of criss-crossed stairways that descend to dim infernos of
roaring machinery.
Its 300-foot Bmokestark doml-i ■
nates the landscape whether seen
from bay or land.
It Is the reason for the town of
Ruston—a town within a city,
created because a smelter may
not be located within the limits
of a city of the first class,
« Five or six hundred men serve
Its machines, feed its furnaces
and watch over its refineries and
the delicate processes of its assay
offices.
Men, wearing respirators like
poison-gas squads in the trenches,
! shovel concentrates from car to
bin. Men ride in little oagee be
(low the great cranes; men run
Jhe toy trains that carry every
thing around the plant.
, Down In the diabolical
Ms vista of the furnace room, in
the glare of strangely-col
ored flames and aiming dis
torted shapes of slag-pots
and black, swinging kettles
i of molten rock and metal,
they swarm, these tiny, in
significant beings, so easy to
break or kill, so small in
comparison with the things
tlicy have made, so Incom
prehensible In the light of
the things they do.
Yet so perfect is the system
< that the plant seems automatic;
V^as if it would go on swallowing
ore and belching forth copper If
there were no men left in the
world.

pot country.
The company voluntarily
raised the wages of employes at
the time of enlargement, the
raise to remain In effect so long
'as copper Is quoted higher than
17 cents.
So, like the rest of us, they
profit by the demand for metal
to hurl into the trenches where
their countrymen are facing each
other.
—This Is a queer and a very
complicated world.
From the days when the old
Romans worked the copper mines
In Spain, copper has been part of
the life-and-deiith business we
call civilization.
Never has it been so Intimate

Speed Cop Grinds Out
His 500,000 th Mile!
George W. Chilberg, Pierce
county speed cop, was riding his
500,000 th mile Tuesday.
Chilberg Is one of Sheriff Long
mlre's reasons for the lack of
speeding on the county road.
"I've been riding a motor bike
for 11 years now," Chilberg ex
plained, "and during that time I
have overhauled more than 7,000
speedsters. The young reckless
kids give me the most trouble."
Chilberg's record Includes the
capture of the famous Spanaway
"wild man" who terrorized that
district about a year ago and a
score or more stlck-up men. He
has nabbed several murderers and
saved the lives of five children.
Strikebreakers
Armed, Arrested
Two negro strike-breakers em
ployed at the Milwaukee docks
were arrested Monday night and
Tuesday morning for carrying
concealed weapons.
Policeman Bell, on guard at
the main entrance to the rail
road's dock barricade,put Robert
Williams, age 17, under arreat
Monday night for carrying a large
dirk In his belt.
The same officer arrested Tom
Gay. age 26, Tuesday morning
for having a huge spring-backed
knife In his pocket.
All strike-breakers entering or
leaving tbe Milwaukee yards are
searched by tho police for weap
ons.

Without copper wires to carry

copper for kettles and pans and
all the pleasant uses of the home,
copper to sheathe the Bhlps that
ply the seas when the seas are
safe again, and copper for our

could hardly live.
And without copper we
would find it quite impossi

When asked if he had ever
been in any serious accidents, he
looked sadly at Deputy Sheriff
Peter Achilles Stenso and said he
had been so staved up on so many
occasions that he didn't think it
possible he could get killed.
"Yep, I sure have spilled, and
a dump at 60 miles is a consider

ONLY NINE
MORE DAYS
Only nine more days to register

elections last spring, and who
have not not re-reglslered, must
once more sign tbe city books, or
lose their right to vote. All names
of persons who failed to vote at
the earlier elections have been!

Magnates In All-Night
Session; Trainmen Sure
WASHINGTON, D. C,
Aug. ____• —The trainmen held
a brief meeting this morning.
They were unable to judge
the situation clearly, but a
general feeling of optimism
prevailed. The trainmen feel
that the railroads will surely
yield to their demands.

WASHINGTON, D. 0.,
Ang. 22. —Eight of the
leading raUroad presidents
of the United Statos formed
an executive council Mon
day night and held an all
night session here.
President Holden of the Bur
lington system, in a statement
made Tuesday morning, said:
•"The committee was in con
tinuous session considering tbe
railroad situation and we have
reached no conclusions yet."
Hundreds of telegrams arrived
today from merchants and manu
facturers urging arbitration. It
was learned that the southern
railroads.' including the Baltimore
4k Ohio, favored making the con
cessions.
The Hill lines flatly refused
and rejected Wilson's proposals.
The New York Central and the
Pennsylvania lines were strongly
against surrendering to the arbi
tration demands.
The committee telegraphed im
portant messages to directors
Tuesday morning and are await
ing answers. An answer will
probably be framed tonight or
Wednesday morning.
Louis Hill denied that the
strike might cause millions of
dollars loss In the wheat crops,
claiming the crops are very short.
"The/ are not even cutting
them," he said, "much less
transporting them."
President Wilson has appealed
to each of 31 railroad executives
before him as one American to
another, and asked for patriot
ism's sake that they keep their
railroads in service.
He believes, so he said, that
lc A COPY
the conditions following the Euro
pean war will be the most pros
perous ever seen in this country,
and that a railroad strike would
affect and hurt every citizen in
the country.
While the railroad men agree
with his reasoning, they believe
he is asking them to sacrifice
their last chance for a settlement.
However, an eleventh hour
agreement and settlement Is
expected at any minute.
Even the railroad presi
dents themselves seem to
feel Wilson's magnetism,
and indications point to
wards a favorable termina
tion of tlie strike despite tbe
serious aspect.
