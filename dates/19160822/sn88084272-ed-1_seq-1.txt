Asks Germany About Cir

Owego Shelled by U-Boat
Berlin, Germany, Aug". 19 (via Lon
don, Aug. 22.) Concerning the Ameri
can note in the case of the steamer
Owego, said to have been fired upon
"by a submarine, efforts are being made
to clear up the facts, German naval au-
i thorities having received their first in
timation of the matter in the American
note and having no other information.
Case In Kept Secret.
Washington. D. C. Aug. 32 The case
of the steamer Owego is surrounded at
the state department with much se
crecy and the foregoing Berlin dispatch
was the first disclosure that a, note
had been dispatched to the German
government.
The Owego, having some Americans
on board, reported having been fired
upon ten times in the Mediterranean
by a submarine early in the month.
She proceeded to port and it was not
made plain whether she had been fired
upon without warning or attempted to
escape.
Ma j- Hai e IVecn tiKtrian I. -Host,
Secretary of state Lansing at the
time announced he was investigating
a case of a ship bearing Americans be
ing attacked, but he declined to give
the steamer's name or any of the de
tails. The inquiry was begun when a
resumption of submarine warfare was
being suggested by the new operations
of submersibles.
The fact that the German govern
ment apepars to have no information
lend strength to a contention that the
attacking submarine ma hae been
Austrian.

Wilson vetoed the bill because of por

Says Tried to Kill Self,
Wife Interferes, Killed
Globe, Ariz, Aug. 22. Michael Mije
usnich, charged with killing his wife
in Miami Friday night and who re
turned to surrender himself at the
spot the tragedy occurred, makes
solemn oath that he is not a murderer.
The couple had separated, the woman
to keep a rooming house and the man
to go to Los Angeles, for medical treat
ment for what appears an incurabl
ailment. Getting worse and with his
funds failing, he purchased an automa
tic revolver, with thought of suicide,
but he determined to see his wife and
children before he died.
He called upon his wife, whom he
found kind and who offered him money,
even slipping some into his Pocket
when he refused acceptance. At Up
time, seized w-ith a paroxysm of his
disease, he pulled the pistol from his
pocket, to end his useless existence.
The woman with quick appreciation
of the situation, tried to tear the
weapon from his hands, but only suc
ceeded in directing its muzzle against
herself, five bullets passing through
her body.

The War At a Glance
rpf!
HE offensive in the Balkans is
full swing with Russian
troops arriving in Saloniki
to fight with the entente forces,
and Rumania reported about ready
to enter the war on th& siae of the
allies. Landing of Italian troops
is continuing and an unofficial dis
patch reports Greek troops engaged
Bulgarians in the vicinity of Seres.
Athens advices indicate that Rus
sian troops have been in the
Balkans more than three weeks,
the initial contingent have appar
ently arrived at Saloniki some time
previous to July 31. the news hav
ing been just released by the
entente censorship.
It is only about 350 miles in an
air line from Russia to Greece, at
the nearest point, but Rumania and
Bulgaria lie between and to bridge
the distance the Russians were
obliged to travel thousands of
miles. As the Bosphorus is closed
by the Turks, they were deprived
of the short sea route.
Today's dispatches regarding de
velopments on the Macedonian
front indicate that the engage
ment is becoming general all along
the 150 mile line. Servian troops
are reported to have captured two
forts, while on the western end of
the line, the Bulgarians claim
notable advances.
For the moment at least, oper
ations on the eastern and v estern
fronts are overshadowed by those
in the Balkans. The entente
offensive, however, is proceeding
uninterrrptedlj on tioth these
fronts The French and British
tod v both claim progress on the

Says Report Is Ridiculous; ?
Panama President-elect
Also Denies It.
Washington. D. C, Aug. 22. At the
Japanese embassy todav it was said
that the published reports of alleged
Japanese aggressions in the isthmus
of Panama for acquisition of a coaling
station were considered part of a prop
aganda to alarm the United States and
so ridiculous as to make a statement
of denial unnecessary.
Valdez Denies Report.
Havana, Cuba. Aug. 22. Dr. Ramon
Maria Valdez, president elect of Pana
ma, declared he knew nothing concern
ing the reported sale of land at the
Atlantic end of the Panama canal to a
Spaniard named Feriianaez. allegedly
for use by Japanese interests. Dr. Val
dez said the report that Fernandez had
obtained a large land concession
through him was absurd. Some time
ago Fernandez approached him on the
subject of buying land, but the idea did
not appeal to him and he dismissed the
subject. Fernandez insisted on having
a letter of introduction to the secre
tary of public works of Panama and
Dr' Valdez says he gave it to him. but
that he knew nothing further of the
movements of Fernandez.
Neither the government of Panama
nor himself Dr. Valdez continued, are
in favor of concessions which are con
trary to the existing treaties between
Panama and the United States.

ASHINGTON, D. C Aug. 22.
.'hile the railroad executives
were working today on a
counter proposal to president Wilson's
plan for averting the threatened rail
way strike, the cabinet went over the
situation fully and confidence was ex
pressed by members that in the end
the railroads would accept the presi
dent's plan. What assurances the cab
inet had to go on for such a conclu
sion were not disclosed.
Cabinet members agreed that it w as
not feasible to hurry the railroad ex
ecutives into a decision as they had
many things to consider.
A counter proposal is expected to be
ihe next step, but there was no out-
irarA dlcat,n todar f when st woald
The answer of more than SO railroad
presidents, including those of western
roads newly arrived, to president Wil
son's proposed plan for averting the
threatened strike was formulated to
day. Every utterance of the railway
heads displayed opposition to the presi
dent's suggestion, but it was consid
ered possible a counter proposal ac
ceptable to the employes would be
made as the basis for further negotia
tions. A committee had in charge the fram
ing of a reply and it appeared doubtful
that it could be finished today. The
employes' committee of 640 continued
to mark time.
Committee Drafts Reply.
The following were announced as
members of the committee which will
work on president Wilson's proposal
and make a report to the assembled
executives:
Hale Holden. Burlington: W. W. At
terbury, Pennsylvania; Fairfax Harri
son, Southern: Robert S. Lovett, union
Pacific; E. P. Ripley. Santa Fe; A. H.
Smith, New York Central; Frank Trum
bull, Chesapeake . Ohio; Daniel Wil
lard, Baltimore &. Ohio. While the
subcommittee was working, the execu
tives got in touch with their board of
directors.
The brotherhood meeting did nothing
and adjourned until 3 oclock this after
noon. fe Explain Railroad Vleir.
Elisha Lee. chairman of the national
conference committee of railways, is
sued a statement of the railroads' at
titude Monday nlsht. in which he said:
"That the railroads should grant, un
der threat of a national strike, a $50,
000.000 wage preferment to a small i..i
nonty of their employes, without a
hearing before a public tribunal, is in
conceivable In a democracy like ours.
All questions at Issue wages, hours,
costs, operating conditions, are sub
merged by the greater issue: shall ar
bitration he abandoned in the settle
ment of industrial disputes."
The statement suggests, however,
that the railroads stand ready to tako
whatever action the people and the
country desire. It concludes:
Public Opinion Must Decide.
"The weight of public opinion must
determine this Issue. We cannot be
lieve that it is the calm judgment
of the country that we should sacri
fice the principle of arbitration in in
dustrial disputes, under a threat to tie
up the commerce of the country."
"The demand is for an eight hour
day, pay basis and this Is the inter
pretation given by the president in the
proposal now before the railroads. The
employes have emphatically made it
known that they do not want eight
; hours work for eight hours pay, a real
eight hour day.
Hon It t ork Out.
"A simple illustration will suffice to
show how the eight hour basisof pay
would work out. Take, for example,
a freight employe paid five cents a
mile with a day's guarantee of 55 for
100 miles or ten hours or less. On a
freight run of. say. only 60 miles In
ten hours, he earns $5 for his time. It
is now nronoed that for this work he
be paid " for the first eight hours
and Sl.25 for the other two hours, a
total of 6.25. Increasing bis pay 25
per cent-
"If. hy reason of traffic delays, he is
held idle on a side track, to that he
does not complete his trip until the
end of 12 hours, he now is paid 6
for his time, no matter how little work
he performs. The demand is to pay
him S7 50 for this 12 hours' service.
Hon- Extras Count I p.
"Meanwhile the employes would con
tinue to have the same opportunities
as now to make still larger pay on the
mileage basis. For example, the man
on a five cent a mile rate, makln. say.
130 miles in only seven hours, earns
S7.50 for his day's work. If after this
he is called for a short period of ur
gency work, say only two hours he
gets another full day's guarantee of
". making $12 50 In this example, for
only nine hours" service. '
