The heaviest fighting is on the 1

Greeks Fighting Bulgars.
LONDON, August 22.?Greek troops
have been fighting the Bulgarians in T
vicinity of Seres since Sunday |

The Greek commander at Seres has! T
lied to arms all the reservists in that; f
locality, says the dispatch. That the;]
anting is of a stubborn character is j
.dicated by the fact that a large number
of Greek soldiers have been killed. J
A dispatch to the Evening News from i
Athens, filed yesterday, says the rei
stance of the Greek troops at Seres ^
has created great excitement in Athens c

Russian Troops at Saloniki.
The offensive in the Balkans is in
ull swing with Russian troops arrivng
in SalonikJ to fight with the entente
forces arid Rumania reported
about ready to enter the war on the
side of the allies.
Landing of Italian troops, who also
are to take part in the Balkan operations,
is continuing. Athens advices
ndicate that Russian troops have been J
n the Balkans for more than three
9 .-e'-ks, the initial contingent having
Dparently arrived at Saloniki some
irre previous to July 31, the news hav- 1
i-ig been just released by the entente ,
ensorship.
Arrival of the Russians at Saloniki, .
t 'gether with yesterday's announcement
that Italian troops had landed ; '
there, is another indication that the ] !
-nt*-nte allies have decided to concen- j j
trate on this front forces sufficient for j
an important campaign. 1
Long Trip for Russians. [ \
It is only about 330 miles in an air I ^
l.ne from Russia to Greece at the near- j .
est point, but Rumania and Bulgaria ! '<
:ie between, and to bridge the dis- ; J
tance the Russians were obliged to !
travel thousands of miles. As the i
Bosporus is closed by the Turks they j
were'.deprived of the short sea route.!
The Russian troops which were sent 1
to France earlier in the war made a},
journey of approximately 17,500 miles, ; .
raveling to Port Dalny, Manchuria, L
overland, and thence by water \'ia the * ,
S'j'-z canal and the Mediterranean. !
Since the "VVJjite sea is open at this :
season it is possible that the Russians i
traveled by the Atlantic route and i
reached Saloniki by way of Gibraltar i
and the Mediterranean.
Today's dispatches regarding developments
on the Macedonia front indicate
that the engagement is becoming
general all alon? the J.~0-mIle line.
Immediately north of Saloniki, in the i
Doir&n region. Serbian troops ar?4 re- '
ported to have captured tworforts, while
if. the heaviest fighting reputed, on the
loft bank of the Struma, the Anglo- ;
Feench forces are attacking the Bulgarians
northwest of Seres.
??r. th?- western end line the Bulgarians
< !aim notable advances, some of
which are conceded. They have pressed
southward from Fiorina, occupying
Kaatoria and Koritsa.
News Held Up by Censor.
ATHENS. Monday. July 31. via Eondon.
August 22 (delayed by censor).?
An initial brigade- of Russian troops
has arrived at Saloniki to Join the
entente allies in the lighting in the
Balkans.
The arrival of the Russians has created
a profound impression here. Even
the royalists who have consistently opposed
participation in ttoe war by
urtece on the side or the entente allies !
seemed almost stunned by the news '
that Russian troops hacl arrived to take
the pari in the campaign which, under
other conditions, might have been taken
by the Greek army.
The general feeling here is that the
bringing in of Russian troops has dispelled
definitely the dream of a greater
Greece, which was conceived a year and
a half ago by the then Premier Venize'os,
who carried Greece well on the
way toward entrance in the war with
the entente allies.

PARIS, August 22.?All the
riorning newspapers comment at;
ength on the possibility of Ru- j nania
joining in the war. The I g
neetings that are in progress in j c
Bucharest are taken to mean that j s
ill the various developments iji r
he situation are being seriously ?
:onsidered, and the general tone t
)f the comment is that the de- c
:isive moment for Rumania's ac-; t
:ion has arrived. j t
Army of 800,000 Men. j p
Operations of the Bulgarian armies f
n Macedonia are interpreted in some j I
juarters as having been undertaken J v
3olely with a view to influencing the ' a
iecision of Rumania. On all sides it is ; s
igreed that a new phase in Balkan his- j f
:ory is opening, and the discission by j r
the press of the varions diplomatic I
phases of the Rumanian situation is j
Followed by an examination of the J
strength, of the Rumanian army. P
The statement is made on good au- u
hority that the number of Rumanian j k
rops that can be mobilized exceeds Jp
iOO.OOO. and that the army is in the !

ion. v

BERLIN, Monday. August 21, via | i3
xrndon. August 22.?The Budapest Az j i}
Sst, which is usually well informed on j a
he Rumanian situation, today prints j ^
l dispatch from its Bucharest corres- |
>ondent saying the agitation for war.
vhich in the last few days has been at
ever heat, has suddenly cooled down. s
t is stated that possibly the end of the b
nobilization is responsible for the o
hango. if not the serious words ut- f,
ered in the Hungarian parliament. I;
(This is the first hint of a Rumanian s
nobilization that has been permitted to o
>ass the allied censorship. Almost ; n
sothing on the Rumanian military sitlation
from the entente viewpoint ha* tl
ome through since the Balkan situa- a
Ion in its present phase reached a si
iritical stage). c]
h
Understanding1 With Entente. c
The Bucharest dispatch adds that
here is no doubt that Premier Bratiano \ V
ias reached an understanding with
.he entente, so that further negotiaions
are unnecessary now for actual
larticipatlon in the war. Meanwhile
:he semi-official Rumanian press is sav- u
igely attacking the conservative or- p
?ans which undertook to discuss mob- j.
ligation and related measures.
More ammunition from France and e
Russia is asserted to be arriving. 1;
The white heat of discussion in Buch- t
irest political circles is now declared
o be subsiding despite the alleged imninence
of the final step. This is as- h
jerted to be due to the failure of the c
Russians to keep up their recent sue- .
jesses and to the proximity of Field
Vlarshal von Hindenburg to the Ru- s
nanian border. r
Bulgar Opinion for War.
German public opinion, apparently, is
lot alarmed at the prospect of Ru- [
nania's entering the war. Officials n
*iew the situation calmly and a similar *
ittitude is being maintained In Vienna. J.
According to reliable sources in Bui-; a
?aria, the prospect of a war with Ru- ;
nania remains popular, owing to the'*
Jesire of the Bulgarians to regain Do- v
jrudja. territory lying along the Black t
?ea. lost by the treaty of Bucharest in a
[913. a
Meanwhile the central powers have t
>ought another 2,000 carloads of beans

ind shipments from Germany to Runania
of industrial products by the
L>ar>ube or by trains continue. ^
Hint at an Ultimatum.
AMSTERDAM, August 21, via Lon- i
Ion, August 22.?The Rumanian situa-!^
Lion again is taking a leading part in .
the war news. Dispatches from Berlin ;
and Bucharest, via Berlin, describe the I (
relations between Rumania and the j t
German allies as extremely serious, i s
Wolff Bureau dispatches hint that an i r
Austro-German ultimatum is in prep-: ^
aration.
The Kreuz Zeitung declares negotia- c
tions that took place at Bucharest at j r
the week end between the Russian j y
military attache and the Rumanian ' t
secretary of war must be considered as j
proof that Rumania has joined the en- ja
tente. ; c
"It is supposed," says this news- r
paper, "that plans for a Russian march t
through Rumanian territory were dis-it
cussed. Of course, Germany would re- <
gard such an arrangement as a casus c
belli." I r
Maj. Moraht says in the Tageblatt: ,
"German and Austrian ministers at !
Bucharest have pointed out the conse- :
quences to Rumania of granting permission
to the Russians to march
through Rumanian territory. Toward
us Rumania must not play her sphinx
tricks so far that one day, with shrugging
shoulders, she will place before
us un fait accompli for which we have
not been able to take proper counter
measures."

DULL MOOSE ATTEMPT
TO DOMINATE SITUATION
)emand for Recognition of Gov. J
Johnson When Hughes Came to
San Francisco Failed.
BY N. 0. MESSENGER.
SAN FRANCISCO, August 22.
?Democratic complaceny, progressive
peevishness and republi:an
resentment are features of the
ituation in this, at present, the
nost politically perturbed of all j
tates in the Union. Let's leave j
he democrats sitting in the sun 1
if their satisfaction and go watch
he republican belligerents over
he way maul each other.
The democrats can afford to be comlacent.
The row in the other camp
orwards their chances of gaining a
"nited .States senator in a republican
acancy and encourages them to expect
"look-in" for the presidency in a
ate which normally should be good
or a hundred thousand republican pluality.
Bull Moose Provokes Trouble.
This is not a fight in the republican
arty. It is a contest between the reg- j
lar republican party and a live and 1
inking bull moose for control of the j
arty organization in California and
he election of a T.'nited States senator
,'ho shall be a republican according to
srm. In a way, it is an echo of similar
ontests waged in the national organsation
and in other states, although it i
hardly correct to call this state of' c
ffairs an echo. It is the "big noise" c
self in this regard.
However, this present row is notably
>cal. as it is intensely personal and
readfully bitter on both sides. The r
torm centers about Hiram Johnson, j f
ull moose governor of the state and i j
andidate before the coming primaries I
or the combined progressive and regu-j '
ir republican nomination for United
tates senator. The democrats have but j
ne candidate for the senatorial nomi- ^
ation, George S. Patton. t
The regular republicans, claiming f
hat Gov. Johnson is not a republican, j.
lthough he Indorsed Hughes, after c
peaking contemptuously of him, and (
harging that if elected to the Senate
e will not vote for republican poll- ! a
ies nor support the republican plat- j p
orm, have put forward as their candi-! y
ate for the senatorial nomination i
Tillis Booth, a protectionist and regu-s .?
ir through and through. t
Republicans Against Johnson. ^
Gov. Johnson is anathema to the reg- l
lar republicans. He is responsible for t
ireventing Taft's name being voted for ?
n 1912, and in the past has stood for j
very thing objectionable to the reguars.
He is radicalism personified to f
V. r e
hem. j,
So intense is their feeling against
im that some republicans make no
oncealment of their intention to vote
or the democratic candidate for United
Itates senator in November if Johnson
eceives the nomination. How many of
he rank and file would actually carry ^
ut that threat no one can estimate.
Immediately there is a counter threat
rom the progressives, v/ho say that
f Booth beats Johnson in the prithAv
will vote for a democrat!
n November. Inferentially it is taken j
hat they would in the same circumtances
support President Wilson i
gainst Mr. Hughes. I <
In the hope of placating- the progres- e
ives of the state, the republican naional
organization placed Chester Ro- | (
veil, progressive leader, on their na- I
ional campaign committee. This was ^
bitter dose to the regular republicans
leekirtg to control the organization of 1
he republicans in California. 2
f
How Howell Wont About It. t
The first thing Mr. Rowell did was *
chat in effect, at least, would be to *
:apitallze the republican state and na- i
ional organization ae an asset of Gov. 1
rohnsorfs senatorial boom. Using the 1
isit of Mr. Hugfces to California as a j
>roposed means to this end, he insist- ^
;d that Mr. Hughes should recognize *
3ov. Johnson conspicuously, and that
he progressive candidate for senator *
ihould publicly share in the cere- j
nonies attending the reception of the *
epublican candidate for President J
vhoin he indorses.
The local committee on arrangements,
ontrolled by the regular republicans, i
efused to allow Gov. Johnson to hitch <
?is senatorial chariot to the president
ial star. They gave recognition to the
irogressives by naming prominent men
imong their number as vice presidents
>f the reception committee. But the
egulars were adamant in their decision <
hat Gov. Johnson should not forward j t
lis senatorial candidacy through spe- ;
:ial recognition while there was another irandidate
in the field for the senatorial j x
lomlnation.
Hughes Turns Down Rowell. c
Mr. Rowell was furious. Intercepting ,
dr. Hughes on his way, he told him that
,ull moose resentment over the ignor- 1
ng of Johnson would threaten the na- '
. 1 in California. Mr. Huirhea
JUUill nvnw
leclined to go behind the returns of the
ocal committee s arrangements.
In his speech here he said he was i
he spokesman of the national republican
party and had no concern with the
ocal differences. The national aim, he
leclared, transcended all local differences,
and he invoked harmony. (
After Mr. Hughes made his speech
Mr. Howell denounced Mr. Hughes' j !
conciliatory remarks as "feeding the ]
people baby pap." He characterized 1
the Hughes' meeting as a "frost,' and i
intimated broadly that progressives i
were disaffected from Mr. Hughes ;
throughout the state.
Mr. Rowel I. mind you, is a member
of the republican national campaign
committee, the executive organization i
that has countrywide supervision over <
the republican party's campaign for
the presidency. He will still support <
Mr. Hughes, however, as will Gov.
Johnson. By inference, Mr. Rowell is <
only afraid that the progressives will
so resent Mr. Hughes failure to esaouse
Gov. Johnson's senatorial cani
lidacy that they will take it "out" j
>n Mr. Hughes next November.
Statement of W. H. Crocker. j
William H. Crocker, the national I
epublican committeeman from Cali- j
ornia and leader of the regular repub- |
icans, had this to say about Mr. j
Lowell:
"In advance of the candidate's arrival
n California 1 asked Mr. Rowell. for I
vhom I entertained the highest regard, j
o join with me In suppressing our dif
erences and unite in the reception to
?e given the candidate, lie made as a I
onditlon the absolute recognition of
Jov. Johnson. We could not do that, j
"Neither was it possible to rrutke '
tny 'fifty-fifty' agreement with the {
rogressives, because our plans had
teen practically completed
"We have not ignored the progreslives.
We have invited their partici>ation
and have sought in every way
0 have them co-operate with us. But
ve could not recognize Johnson.
"The demands of Rowell have been
inreasonable, but the raving grace of
he situation is that he represents only
1 small portion of the progressives,
rhe bulk of the progressives are for
-lughes and will vote for him."
This is but on? angle of the dread- :
1 political muddle in this state. In
ubseguent dispatches the broad political
line-up on issues will be explained.

SUNSHINE AND SHADOW.
DEMOCRATS SEE
ELECTIONVICTORY
Notes of Optimism Sounded j
From All Quarters at
\
White House.
HUGHES FAILS TO AROUSE
ENTHUSIASM, IS CLAIM |
Dubious Feeling Prevalent When
Republican Candidate's Trip
Opened Has Faded.
Optimism prevails among democratic
visitors to the White
House and in the correspondence
reaching there from all parts of
the country. Old and experienced
employes of the White House are
of the opinion that they have
never seen an administration in
office more sanguine of receiving
the approval of the country at an
approaching election. Democratic
statesmen and visitors
generally carry to the executive
offices the same confidence. Cabinet
officers bubble over with their
rosy views as to the outlook.
The optimism has increased with the
apparent failure of Candidate Hughes
to arouse his followers through the
country to anything like enthusiasm
for him. !
A Little Dubious at First.
"When Mr. Hughes started out democrats
paying the White House occasional
visits were a little dubious. They
felt that President Wilson had done
enough to earn re-election, but they
did not know what Mr. Hughes had up
his sleeve or how successful he would
be in stirring republicans to the fighting
point. Now that Mr. Hughes has
half finished his swing across the continent.
these democrats are no longer
worried: they are positively overflow
ing with political joy. They can not
see a dent in the democratic lines. According
to their view Mr. Hughes has
been disappointing to his own party
aim to the people generally.
Many Progressives for Wilson.
It is claimed by democratic leaders
who consulted the Presildent that Mr.
Hughes' speeches and his attitude generally
are not winning the progressive
vote for him. Letters reaching the
White House and Capitol are said to
show that Mr. Hughes has IdSt; valuable
time in rallying the progressive vote
and that at least one-third of that vote
has already lined up for President Wilson.
A metropolitan newspaper, long
the recognized organ of the progressives
of the country, lately has been
canvassing the progressives of New
York state. Of 150 answers received
from progressive committeemen, 100
were for Hughes and fifty for Wilson.
Replies from enrolled voters of New
York, who had remained stearfast to
the progressive party through 1914,
showed 5,238 for Hughes and 1,653 for
Wilson. Canvasses in otner states snowed
about the same ratio. According: to
the paper's analysis of the canvas
the net gain for Hughes from the
progressives vose will be only twothirds
of the total alignment of that
party as showft in the votes cast in
1U11. not in 1912. Fully 2,000,000 pro

gressives stuck by the party in 1914, it i
is claimed. According: to the statistics ?
President Wilson will get one-third of c
these. s
i
Counting on Independents. c
The democrats are counting strongly t
upon the independent vote, too. Sena- *
tor Pomerone of Ohio is among those f
who looks to heavy democratic gains I
from independent voters. Speaking at j
the White House today of the outlook f
in his own state, he said: "Independent 1
voters in Ohio are lining up with the j
President. They, like the farmer and 3
the small business man, are content ?
with present conditions. They do not
want to experiment by a change in the
White House. All this will count in
the November vote."
Democratic leaders w.ho go to the c
White House declare that the republicans
are not going to be able to find *
an issue that will hurt the party. The 1
republicans, they point out, are begin- .
ning to lay more stress on the tariff .
and alleged democratic incompetency
in handling this and business affairs, =
hut the democrats assert that they are .
willing to meet the republicans on
this ground, further expressing the belief
that the country knows that no- ^
body can tell what sort of a tariff ^
will best suit when the adjustment .
comes after the European war. '
Democrats at first feared that Mr. .
Hughes would be able to hurt them on ,
the Mexican problem, but reports from
the west and other directions causes
them to believe that the President's
hanHlinir nf TVf*?rlr?n has rtnnA ns much :
to strengthen him with the country as
anything in his administration.
ITALIAN KING AT GORIZIA !
UNDER HEAVY SHELL FIRE
Enters Captured City Over Bridge !
Which Austrian Artillery

(
UDINE, Italy, Sunday, August 20, via
Paris, August 22.?King Victor Emmanuel
entered Gorizia today under the
fire of the Austrian artillery. Lucinio
bridge, which he crossed to enter the is
city, continues to be the object of re- fi
lentless shelling by the Austrian guns, ^
but, unmindful of the danger, the king
determined to make a personal visit to 8
the captured city.
The king went to the city hall, where
he inquired regarding the measures P
which have been taken to restore the ?
civil life of the city. Girls working in "
the vicinity learned of his presence and ^
improvised a manifestation, which was ;
interspersed with shouts of "Long live
our king! Long live Italy!" News of 3
the royal visit spread throughout the P
city, and there was a demonstration as
the king's automobile passed through ?
the streets. ?

RAILROAD HEADS
TO CONCEDE POINTS,
BUT WITH PROVISOS
Will Agree to Basic Eight-Hour
Day, With Pro Rata Overtime,
It Is Said.
WOULD LET COMMISSION
DECIDE CONTINGENT ISSUES
Hope to Maintain Principle of Arbitration
in Settling
Disputes.
DRAFTING THE REPLY TODAY
i
Statement Dealing With Strike Situation
Expected to Go to President
Wilson Tomorrow.
Sixty railroad presidents, representing
practically all the systems
of the United States, expect
to give President Wilson their
reply tomorrow to his proposal for
averting the threatened railroad
strike.
It will be a virtual acceptance
of the President's proposal, carrying
the concession of a basic
eight-hour day with pro rata overtime
equivalent to a 20 per cent
increase on overtime work, according
to those in the confidence
of the railroad executives, but it
will carry qualifications to which
it is hoped that the President and
brotherhood officials will yield.
Possible Qualifications.
These qualifications will be some sort
of counter proposal that the contingent
issues be considered by the interstate
commerce commission or that a commission
appointed to consider them be
made permanent.
By such a counter proposition the
railroad officials hope to maintain the
principle of arbitration in settlement
of all industrial disputes and to be
properly on record so that the interstate
commerce commission will recognize
the transaction of increased
wages as not being voluntarj% which
will give the roads a stronger standing
when they apply to this commission
for permission to increase their
rates.
A special committee of eight prominent
railroad chiefs has been in continuous
session today drafting the reply
to the President. When they have
the "general considerations" satisfactorily
shaped and worded their report
will be read to the entire body of the
railroad officials, both the presidents and
the managers who hold the power of
attorney for the roads.
That this committee is sincerely at
work to draft a statement that will b?acceptable
for settlement of the controversy
and that they are preparing
to meet as far as they can the President's
proposal was indicated today by
the fact that while in conference they
were in direct communication with
their boards of directors.
Some of the railroad officials said this
committee hopes to finish its work this
afternoon. The members of the committee
are: Hale Holden, Chicago, Burlington
and Quincy railroad; W. W. Atterbury,
Pennsylvania railroad; Fairfax
Harrison, Southern railway; R. S.
Lovett, Union Pacific railroad; E. P.
Ripley, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
railroad: Alfred H. Smith, New York
Central railroad; Frank Trumbull.
nntl flhin milrnad and
Daniel Willard, Baltimore and Ohio
railroad.
The appointment of this committee,
;oupled with the fact that the chiefs of
several of the largest railroad systems
were In secret conference throughout
:he night and until well into the early
horning at the Metropolitan Club, was
said today to be a strong Indication
:hat the railroad officials wish to get
:he matter settled one way or another
:omorrow.
Cabinet Is Confident.
While the railroad executives were
working today on a counter proposal
:o President Wilson's plan for averting
the threatened railway strike, the cabnet
went over the situation fully, and
;onftdence was expressed by members
:hat in the end the railroads would accept
the President's p.lan. What assurances
the cabinet had to go on for
such a conclusion were not disclosed.
Cabinet members agreed that it was
lot feasible to hurry the railroad executives
into a decision, as they had
nany things to consider.
Strike Not Expected.
The general feeling among them is
hat it will be settled without a strike
nd that both sides will make some
oncessions.
If the agreement when reached caries
with it provision for the appointnent
by authority from Congress of a
lonir, ission to consider the contingent
rrtnr.sitions or any other phase of the
tit .ration Congress stands ready to take
lotion promptly. All members of Congress
have been kept closely informed
is to the contention or either side In
he controversy.
Congress stands ready to act immeiately
should legislation become necesary,
according to members of the Sente
committee on interstate commerce,
o far, however, the disposition of the
enators is to leave the matter in the
amis of the President, believing that
e will be able to bring about a soluion
of the trouble which now threatens.
Confidence in President.
"I have every confidence that the
Resident will be able to handle the
ituation," said Senator Xewlanda of
levada, chairman of the interstate com*
rnmmittae. today. He has Just
eturned to Washington from Mains,
rhere ha has bsen for the last week.
"No steps are contemplated by Congress
at present looking to legislation
o aid in bringing about a settlement of
he railroad controversy." he continued.
But If any such steps become necesary
I believe that Congress would not
romptly."
