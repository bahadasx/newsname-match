Secretary of War Baker De
clares Militia Will Remain
Until All Danger to Amer
ican Lives Is Past.
MANY COMPLAINTS
MADE TO DEPARTMENT
"Militia Is Winning Bloodless
Victories," Adds Official
Security of Border En
hanced By Their Presence.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON'. Aug. 21. The na
tional guard will be retained on the
Mexican border until it can be with
drawn without again endangering
American live and property. Secre
tary Baker so declared the administra
tion's policy today, in answering a
score of letters from many parts. of
the country complaining that the state
heine held in serv'ce
after their emergency for which they
were called out apparently had passed.
In general the couipainants, whose
names were withheld, allege fiat bor
der service was ntailing loss financial
ly on militiamen and hardship on their
families. The secretary replied to
all those seeming to merit attention.
By its presence on the border, he
wrote to one. the guard is "winning
bloodless victories daily." He de-,
clared that Americaa residents along
the international line were enjoying
a peace and security they could not
know without the military forces to
protect them.
The department appreciates, Mr.
Baker sa'd. in another letter, the fact
that a call for military service upon
militia organizations must "inevitably
present cases of hardship." He added:
"The emergency, however, which re
quired this call for the militia was one
of a grave character, affecting the
safety and lives of citizens of the
Vnlted States men, women and chil
dren The presence of the militia on
the Mexican border has restored or
der and givn a high degree of safety
a ...ritv to the lives of our peo
ple in fiat troubled country than they
have for a long time had. The militia
'is therefore performing a valuable
.service and the fact that the service
is being performed without active
military actions entailing loss of life
to our soldiers, is a cause of .congra
tulation and happiness."
Referring to the elaborate and ex
tensive training the militiamen are
j-eceiving under supervision of regu
lar army officers, the secretary ex
pressed the opinion that it would fit
them to act in time of war or other
emergencies as a supporting arm, or
second line for the regular army, fur
pishing an assert to national prepar
edness that could not have been ob
tained otherwise.
"Clearly, so soon as a restored
state of order on the border Justifies
it. these troops will be returned to
their homes." he wrote. " in the mean
time, it is not possible for the de
partment to say how soon such a situ
ation will arise, although the Mexican
situation is one of increasing hope
fulness." In another letter he called attention
to steps taken to relieve guardsmen
where there is unusual hardships re
sulting from their being called into
the service.
"I am filled with admiration for the
spirit with which the militia has met
this call." the secretary said, "and
with which they are performing an
important and necessary service to
their country."
To another correspondent, the secre
tary explained fiat the national guard
was maintained for such exigencies
as that which now exists on the bor
der, and that it had cost the govern
ment many millions to prepare and
keep it ready for such emergencies.
He pointed out that national guards
men were fully aware of the duties
they undertook when they enlisted.
All of the letters emphasized the
scientific and highly successful man
ner in which the mobilization of the
national guard had been handled by
army officers. As evidence of this,
attention was directed to the low sick
rate and to the adequate measures
taken to insure proper sanitary con
ditions and provide ample and varied
food supplies.
Rumor to the effect that the
Republicans of Cochise county
would not have a full ticket in
the field were di3ipated yester
day when the complete personnel
of the primary candidates became
known. Party leaders have been
working for several weeks to Ret
out candidates for each and every
office and the announcement
that a complete offering will be
made has given the local G. O. P.
much encouragement.
Headquarters, with a secretary
in charge, will be opened in Bis
bee within the next few days, and
a vigorous campaign promises to
be carried on. The organization
promises to give the Democrats
the hardest race they have had
since the Cameron campaign in
190S.
In no case, with one exception,
is there a contest for the nomina
tion. That contest is in Bisbee
for the nomination for justice of
SENATE RE'
Ten Democrat! Vote With Re
publican Majority and Take
Up Consideration of Im
migration BilL
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHIXGTOX. Aug. 21. An un
expected Democratic revolt in the
Senate today resulted in the immigra
tion bill being taken up in defiance
of the Democratic caucus and opened
the way for efforts to display the
revenue bill as unfinished business,
an action which might Indefinitely
prolong the session of Congress.
Ten Democratic senators voted with
the solid Republican minority to take
up the immigration bill upon a mo
lion of Senator Smith. f Scuth Caro
lina, chairman of the immigration
committee. They were Ashurst,
Breckham, Chamberlain, Culberson,
Hardwick, Lane, Myers, Overman,
Smith, of South Carolina, and Varda-'
man.
Debate began on tiie measure im
mediately and proceded until 2 o'clock
when the revenue bill automatically
came before the Senate. Senator
Smith then moved to displace the
revenue bill, provoking an all after
noon discussion which will be re
sumed when the Senate meets tomor
row. Administration leaders said tonight I
that they had enough votes to defeat'
the Smith motion. Even some of the
revolting Democrats have declared
their intention of voting against it.
Should it prevail, the resulting fight
over the literacy test provision would
upset adjournment calculations.
Senator Stone, chairman of the for
eign relations committee, was parti
cularly aroused over the action of the
revolters. He charged them with
treachery to the party in overturn'rg
the decision of the Democratic caucus
to postpone action on the immigration
bill until December.
"It turns out to be Republican min
ority in the control of legislation,"
said Senator Stone. "I. for one.
would rather be in the position of
standing with the Democrats who re
mained faithful to their party action
than to cross the aisle and join hands
with the Republican minority.".
Senator Stone's words aroused the
ire of Senators Hardwick and Smith
of South Carolina.

DOl'GLAS, Aug. 21. General P. Klias Calles assumed official command
of the Yaqui Indian campaign about the middle of last week, relieving Gen

he will be stationed, according to arrivals from Hermosillo.
WUh General Etrada went 5.000 of Obregon's veteran troops sent to
Sonora early in the year to fight the Yaquis and moved later to the border
district during the recent crisis. In explanation of this move, a high Mex

Republican Candidate for
President Tells Los Angeles
Audience He Had Not Haul

(By Review Leased Wire)
LOS AXGELES, Aug. 21. Charles
E. Hughes told an audience in the
Shrine Auditorium here tonight that
he had not "hauled down the flag," he
put up in New York.
"We have had periods when the
public Interest in this country was
ignored; when it was deserted and not
safeguarded by law," he. said. " I am
glad those periods are pasL I believe
they have passed. I believe there is
a good sentiment abroad in this land
which recognizes fie interests of com
munities and that there is a sentiment
which demands protection of the In
terests of communities against all
spoliation, against conspiracies and
against combinations of any sort. I
did something in Xew York along
that line, and I haven't changed my
mind a bit in regard to it.
"There again it Is the question of
studying the facts, of analyzing the
actual conditions and coming to con
clusions that are fair. What men are
afraid of in this country on one side
or the other of the great controversy
is that they will in some way be taken
In camp, and each side is inclined Jo
push up its side just a little above
what is fair and right. Xow let us
have the confidence of honest people
that it is going to protect the public
to maintain individual rights and that
it is going to have justice reign in this
country not because it will help you
as against this or that one; not be
cause it will enable you or that one,
but be cause it is just and because on
Justice must be founded the lasting
prosperity of th's nation.

have passed the day when we had to

to crush out what was Illegitimate and
fair and illegal. We can protect our
selves aga'nst every kind of monopol

must not scoff at that which makes
production possible and expands
trade. We must cut where there is
abuse, and cut in order that we may

SALONIKI CAMPAIGN
OPENS ON LONG FRONT
Reports From Berlin Appear
to Confirm Roumanian Pos
sibilities. Ultimatum May
Be Sent from Germans.
(By Review Leased Wire)
The opening of the allied of
fensive at Saloniki has been the
signal for renewed reports that
Rumania is at last about to throw
in her lot with the Entente. These
reports are more circumstantial
than before and German press
comments indicate that they are
far from being devoid of founda
tion. One Berlin newspaper de
clares that Rumania already join
ed the Allies and that plans are
t?ing laid for the march of a
Russian army through Rumanian
territory. Major Moraht, the
Gern.an military critic, also be
lieves that Rumania is negotiat
ing with Russia and hints at an
ultimatum to Bucharest from
Germany and Austria.
The entry of Rumania into the
war on the side of the Entente
would mean the forging of an
other link In the chain of foes
surrounding the Central Powers,
the material aid which Rumania
could give would be of Import
ance. Her army is reputed to be
one of the best equipped and
trained in Europe.
Apart from possible Russian re
inforcement, Rumania would be
in a position to deal a powerful
blow at Bulgaria from the north
in conjunction with the Allies'
drive from the south. It had been
generally understood that Rus
sians are. willing to concede the .
Province of Bessarabia, the popu-.
lation of wtoifch la. largely Ru
manian for return for Rumanian
co-operation in the war. Bessara
bia is 18,000 miles square in ex
tent and has a population of near
ly 2,000,000.

military experts, its possession Is vital

Reports from Saloniki say that

This, if confirmed, means that Italy
has decided formally .to declare war
