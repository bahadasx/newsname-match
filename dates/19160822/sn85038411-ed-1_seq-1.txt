Make Some Gains in West
The offensive in the Balkans is in
full swing with Russian troops ar
riving In Saloniki to fight with the
entente forces and Rumania repored
about ready to enter the war on the
side of the allies.
Landing of Italian troops who are
also to take part in the Balkan oper
ations. is continuing. An unofficial
dispatch also reports that Greek troops
have been engaged with Bulgarians in
the vicinity of Seres.
Indicates Big Campaign
Athens advices indicates that Rus
sian troops have been in the Balkans
for more than three weeks, the initial
contingent having apparently arrived
at Saloniki some time previous to July j
31, the news having been just released j
by the entente censorship.
Arrival of the Russians at Saloniki,
together with yesterday's announce
ment that Italian troops had landed
there, is another indication that the
entente allies have decided to concen
trate on this front forces sufficient for
an important campaign.
It is only about 350 miles in an air
line from Russia to Greece at the
nearest point, but Rumania and Bul
garia lie between and to bridge the dis
tance the Russians were obliged to
travel thousands of miles. As the Bos
phorus is closed by the Turks they
were deprived of the short sea route. '
The Russian troops which were sent j
to France earlier in the war made a '
■* journey of approximately 17,500 miles,
traveling to Port Dalny, Manchuria,
overland, and thence by water via the
Suez canal and the Mediterranean.
Since the White Sea is open at this
season it is possible that the Russians
traveled by the Atlantic route and
reached Saloniki by way of Gibraltar
and the Mediterranean.
Fighting on Wide Front
To-day's dispatches regarding devel
opments on the Macedonian front indi
cate that the engagement is becoming
general all around the 150-mile line.
Immediately north of Saloniki in the
Doiran region Serbian troops are re
ported to have captured two forts,
while in the heaviest fighting reported,
on the bank of the Struma, the Anglo-
French forces are attacking the Bul
garians northwest of Seres.

HAS EFFECT ON BULGARIA
Definitely Dispels Dream of
Greater Greece; Policy
Irritates Many
By Associated Press (
Athens, July 21, via London, Aug. 22
(delayed by censor). —An initial bri
gade of Russian troops has arrived at
Saloniki to join the entente allies in
the fighting in the Balkans.
The arrival of the Russians has
created a profound impression here.
Even the Royalists, who have consist
ently opposed participation in the war
by Greece on the side of the entente
allies, seemed almost stunned by the
news that Russian troops had arrived
to take part in the campaign, which
under other conditions might have
been taken by the Greek army.
The general feeling nere is that the
bringing in of Russian troops has dis
pelled definitely the dream of a greater
Greece which was conceived a year
and a half ago by the then Premier
Venizelos, who curried Greece well on
the way Howard entrance in the war
with the entente allies.
It is regarded as possible that the
presence of Russian forces in Mace
donia will effect a change in the atti
tude of Bulgaria.
In some quarters irritation is dis
played at the recent foreign policy of
the Greek government, which is said
to have overlooked the interests of
this nation.
Main Crater of Katmai
Volcano Found to Be One
of Greatest in World
By Associated Press
Kodiak, Alaska, Aug. 22.—The main
crater of Katmai volcano is one of j
the greatest in the world, according
to a statement maae io-day by Robert j
F. Griggs, who has reached Kodiak ,
after a careful study of the volcano |
in the Interests of the American Geo- j
graphic Society.
"This crater," he said, "is miles;
wide and extends down thousands of I
feet to n blue-gretin lake, shimmering!
and sputtering at the bottom."
Mr. Griggs was accompanied on the |
expedition by Lucius G. Folsom and i
Donovan Church, a student at the,
Ohio State University. This -is the first j
close examination by scientists that |
has been made of the volcano since 1
the great eruption In June, 1912, when
the ton of the mountain was blown off
'■ and Kodiak Island, across Shelikoff
j Strait, was covered with a foot of vol
canic ash.
German Peace Terms Are
Intolerable, Asquith Says
London, Aug. 22. "The German i
government has as yet shown no dis
position to agree to peace except on
terms 'that would be intolerable or
humiliating to some of the allies," said
Premier Asquith, replying in the House
of Commons to-day to Sir William
i Pollard Byles, one of the little group
of peace advocates.
"The sugegstion of Dr. Zimmerman i
j ( German under-secretary for foreign
I affairs) that the entente is influenced h
j by any pressure from Great Britain is j
quite untrue," added the Premier.
Asked further whether terms of any
kind had been suggested, Premier As
quith replied:
"Only what has been seen in the
press; nothing official."

President Will Again
Veto Immigration Bill if
It Comes Before Him
By Associated Press
Washington, Aug. 22. President
Wilson let it be known to-day that he
would veto the immigration bill if it
came before -him again with the liter
acy test and the Senate defeated the
motion to take up the measure and
returned to consideration of the reve
nue bill. The President's announce
ment, which settled the question, ar
rived just when the Democrats were
continuing their party row over the
9-ction of the nien revolting Democrats
who refused to be bound by the cau
cus which decided to let the bill go
over, and the leaders of the revolt
were making caustic replies to the re
proaches of eSnator Stone.
On the President's word that he
would veto the bill five of the revolt
ing Democrats turned about and voted
against the motion to take i up. They
were Senators Beckham, Chamberlain,
Culberson, Lane and Overman. They
made the vote 32 to 23. Senators
Ashurst, Hardwick. Myers, Smith of
South Carolina and Vardaman, all
Democrats, however, stuck to their
votes to take it up. The Senate's ac
tion means that efforts to consider the
bill at this session probably will be
dropped.

Washington, Aug. '12.. The answer
of m6re than sixty railway presidents,
Including those of western roads newly
arrived, to President Wilson's proposed
for averting the threatened strike was
being formulated to-day. Every utter
ance of the railway heads displayed
opposition to the President's sugges

counter proposal acceptable to the em

further negotiations.

framing of a reply and It appeared
doubtful that it could be finished to
