PEACE TERMS NOT
SUITED TO ALLIES
London, Aug. 22.—"The German
government has as yet shown no dis
position to agree to peace, except on
terms that would be intolerable or
humiliating to some of the allies," said
Premier Asquith in the house of com
mons.
"The suggestion of Dr. Zimmerman
.(German under secretary for foreign
affairs) that the, entente is Influenced
by any pressure from Great, grifaih is
thi
quite untrue," added »e premier.
ft ANK ATTACK
This is Object of Russians
Germans Have Strong
Fortifications.
Petrograd, via London, Aug. 22.—
The feature of the Russian campaign
which broke out like a tempest on
the southwestern front over two
months and a half ago, Is the almost
continuous nature of the fighting.
With the exception of brief interludes
for consolidating positions or chang
ing the direction of attack, it has
been like one great sustained battle.
Periods like the present, which are
described as "lulls" usually turn
to have been crowded with intense
fighting, the details of which it has
been the consistent policy of the Rus
sian staff to hold secret the op
erations are ended.
It Is impossible at present to say
whether the Russian attack upon
Kovel, from the Stokhod region con
tinues with its original energy, but
the belief seemn to prevail here that
the discovery of a series of strong
German fortlfioations protecting Ko
vel from the east led the Russian
staff to base its hopes on the
city by strong flank attacks, which
are now developing. This Is consid
ered to account for the desperate
German attacks in the region of Lake
Nobel, where they are trying to pre
vent the Russian occupation of the
marshy land south of the Stokhod,
which would constitute a serious
menace to the left flank of the Ger
man fioroes whose base is Kovel, and
prove a valuable vantage point to Gen.
Kaledines in the pressure he is exert
ing in the. south.
The strengthening of the Austrian
forces in the Oarpathtarns has suc
ceeded momentarily in checking the
Biwian movement in this direction,
hot the Russians are declared to oe
able to hold all the positions recently
won.

Athens, via London, Aug. 22.—An
initial brigade of Russian troops ar
rived at Saloniki to Join the Entente
allies in the fighting in the Balkans
recently. The arrival created a pro
found impression here. Even the roy
allsts, who consistently opposed parti
cipation In the war by Greece on be
half of the Entente allies, seemed
stunned by the arrival of the Russians
to participate in the campaign, which,
under other conditions, might be un
dertaken by the Green army.
It is regarded possible that the
presence of the Russians in Macedon
ia will effeot a change in the attitude
of Bulgaria.
The general feeling here Is that the
bringing of the Russians has dispelled
definitely the dream of a, greater
Greeoe, 'which was ooncelved a year
and a half ago by the then Premier
Venizelos, who carried Greece well on
the way toward an entrance in the
war with the Entente allies.

movement of the Entente allies are
hindered by the plight of the civil
population before the Bulgarian ad
vance.
After a conference the French,
British, Serbian and Russian com
manders at Saloniki today decided
that the Russians should take up po

Crown Prince Alexiwder of Serbia is
the nominal commander, but Russian
General Frlederictss is in actual
command.
The Italian contingent of troops
landing at Salohlkl really is of Im
portant proportions. The Temps, in a
military review, -alludes to the pres
ence of the Rus^bn troops along the
Vardar river, pointing to the fact that
five allied contingents are engaged
now in the Entente campaign in the
Balkans. The Kalian movement is
construed as showing that compre
hensive political agreements have
been arranged itr advance, and also
another evidencC-pf the international
spirit prevailing i|1nong the Entente.
Capture Serbian Positions.
Berlin, Aug. ti.—(Via London.)—
All Serbian positions on the Malka
Niereplanina, eaJt of Banica on the
Macedonian front*'.haye been captured
by troops of the central powers, the
war office announced today.
The French, adds the announce
ment, have been driven out of Buth
kova and Tahlmoa.
Bulgarians Advance.
Berlin, Aug. 22.—The official an
nouncement of the Sofia war office
says that on August 18, the Bulgarian
left wing began a general offensive,
advancing in the Struma valley, occu
pying Demi Hissar, and establishing
itself on the left bank of the Struma,
after repulsing the British and French
near Seres.
Saloniki Fighting General.
Paris, Aug. 22.—Fighting on the
Saloniki front is becoming more gen
eral, says a Havas dispatch from Sa
loniki. In the Doiran section, Serbian
troops captured the forts of Kaima
kadar and Cucurlu.
Greek troops have been fighting
the Bulgarian* in the vicinity of
Seres since Sunday morning, says an
Athens dispatch to the Exchange Tel
egraph company. The Greek com
mander at Seres, kn Important city
of about 80,000, has called to arms
all reservists In that locality, says the
dispatch. That the fighting is of a
stubborn character is indicated by the
fact that a large number of Greek
soldiers have been killed.
The heaviest fighting is on the front
northeast of Saloniki on the left bank
of the Struma river from Kaviala to
Barkli. On the western end the line
of hostilities is confined for the most
part to artillery.

Toivonen arrived (n Hancock from
Finland today, after two attempts to
escape from serving in the Russian

According to Toivonen, all avenues
of escape from Finland of men of
military age are closely guarded, and
although many of his countrymen are
desirous of coming to America, few
care to take the riak.
Toivonen crossed the Gulf of Both
nia, seventy-five miles wide, in a

to this country, forwarded by friends
here, awaited him.

Only Few Automobile Own
ers Comply with Orders
of City Administration.
Although the baa has been placed
on parking automobiles on the busi

have neglected to comply with the
ordinance and nearly as many ma
chines are crowded about the curbings
on Third street as before the council
took action on' the matter. During
the buelest periods of the day, when
traffic on the principal business streets
is the heaviest, car owners negligent
ly stop their machines next to the
curb, oftentimes with the rear end
close to the center of the street, and
leave it in this position for several
hours.
As a result, serious accidents are
narrowly averted daily. A few car
owners have recognised the advant
age of leaving their machines in the
parking sections, but theee are In the
minority. When speaking of the con
dition this morning. Mayor Dinnie
said:
"With the many automobile acci
dents that have taken place in and
near Grand Forks during the past few
months, automobile owners must
necessarily recognize the safety first
methods which have been mapped out
by the city officials for the protection
of drivers and pedeetrlans alike. The
leaving of oars near the ourbs on the
main streets Is purely negligence and
must be done away with.
"Unless the car owners co-operate
with the officials, little can be done to
relieve the congested condition that
has proven so detrimental in the past.
I sinoerely hope that further cataatro
phlea will not be necessary to awaken
the machine owners %o the urgency of
parking their cars In the prater
placea"
Accordtiy to thq city ordinance

Minneapolis, Minn., Aug. 22.—Louis

'fPhe raw supply seems to be suf
