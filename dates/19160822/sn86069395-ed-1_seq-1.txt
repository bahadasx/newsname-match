General Engagement in The;
Balkans Covers a Front
of 150 Miles in Length. '
Paris, Aug. 21. Reports from Sa
loniki show that the general engage
ment, which began Friday, is contin
uing with intensity over an extended
front from Fiorina, near Monastir, to
the river Struma. This represents am
irregular line nearly 150 miles long-
The operations have been long ex
pected as a part of the allies co-ordinated
offensive on all fronts. They
follow the arrival of Gen. Cordonnier,,
commanding the French, after ex
tended conferences with officials here.
Advices received in Paris indicate
that Germans and Bulgarians arc
seeking to anticipate the movement
by taking the offensive on the left,
where the Serbians had moved up to
witbin 25 miles of Monastir, holding:
Fiorina as an observation post. Their
orders were not to attempt to retain
Fiorina if they were attacked. The
Serbian war office says the Bulgarians
were thrown back on their old posi
tions but that later the Serbians, fol
lowing instructions, evacuated Fiori
na, which the Bulgarians then occu-
pteu.
later delivered a heavy counter at
tack against a large Bulgarian force
debouching from Fiorina toward Ban
icat. Fighting continues in this re
gion. In the center French and British
forces near Lake Doiran, followed am
intense bombardment with infantry
attacks, in which the British occupied
the strategic point of Dolzzeli. Farth
er east the French right rushed a se
ries of small villages in much the-
same manner as the rrencn rignr
carried villages on the Somme front.
The situation along the whole line is"
regarded here as satisfactory for tho
allies. There is every indication that
the operations are expected rapidly.
A German squadron of some fif
teen warships, including large cruis
ers, is reported in the North Sea by
trawlers arriving at Ymuiden, Hol
land, a Reuter dispatch says. The
squadron was sighted in the region or
White Bank and was accompanied by
two Zeppelins. It was on a northr
westerly course.
Two British light cruisers, the Not
tingham and Falmouth were sunk
Saturday in the North Sea by Ger
man submarines while the vessels:
were searching for the German high
seas fleet. One German submarine
was destroyed by the British while,
another was rammed and possibly
sunk.
