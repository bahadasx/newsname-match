The last official dispatches reported
French forces attacking this Bulgar

on the whole front, the allies are

Bakersfieid. Calif., Aug. 22.
Charles E. Hughes, Republican presi
dential nominee started a little more
than three weeks ago to make fc. ten
thousand mile campaign trip but he
has already covered pretty nearly all
of that mileage and just began to hit
the trail back across the continent.
Speaking at several California towns
today on his way to Sacramento and
Reno, the candidate dwelt on his
I charge of Democratic inefficiency in
larm iegimnun. ju.- uiauagci s uc
clare that he has found this a popular
theme with his audiences. Prepared
ness, too, they declare, is also sub
ject of deep interest on the Pacific
coast, judging from the volume of ap
plause with which Governor Hughes's
statements on this issue have been re
ceived. Twelve thousand persons packed
Shrine Auditorium to the doors and
thronged in the streets outside unable
to gain admission when Hughes spoke
at Los Angeles last night. Democratic
tariff ideas were attacked vigorously
by him and he asserted that only the
European war prevented them trom
wrecking many American industries.
European War Rescued Industries
"I believe that regulation and su
pervision by the government," lie said
at one point, "is a mockery unless it is
just and square with the facts. I put
that flag ud in New York and I never
pulled it down and never propose to.
It is a question of studying the facts,
of analyzing the actual conditions r.nd
coming to conclusions that are fair.
"We have passed the day when we
had to restrict what was legitimate in
order to crush out what was illegiti
mate and unfair and illegal. We can
protect ourselves against every kind of
monopolistic pracuce wimoui. """"

whicn win permit the extension of

Tiins and extend our trade, we have got
to make reasonable and wise tariff
leffisiation, so that everywhere thruout
this country where there is a legiti-
mate interest needing protection It
shall have it and not be denied."
75 to 100 Iilos by Auto Daily.
Hughes has averaged close to seventy-five
or 100 miles a day in auto
trips since he left New York. He has
probably not walked more than two
miles in the whole twenty-three days
of his journeying. Everywhere he
goes, if it is only a few hundred feet,
the candidate rides in an auto. Not
withstanding this almost utter lack of
exercise. Governor Hughes is in per
fect physical condition, according to
his physician. He is looking forward
an exceedingly busy day to write
long letter to his daughter Catherine,
who was 9 years old yesterday.
Hughes's itinerary today took him to
Porterville, Visalia and several other
cities in the San Joaquin Valley. He
will deliver a speech in Sacramento
tonight and will then leave California
and pass into Nevada.

Railway Heads Would Settle
Dispute by Arbitration.
WOULD LEAVE IT TO HIM
Presidents Offered to Allow
Wilson Complete Power.
Explanation of Wage Side of
Strike Question.
Tension in Topeka railway circles
went tighter again today when private
official advices- were received from
Washington to the effect that Presi
dent Wilson; after throwing "aside ar
bitration as a way of settling the
train-service brotherhood wage con
troversy, has refused a proposition of
the railroad heads to settle the dispute
thru a disinterested board of investi
gation. The investigation proposition
was put before the president in an
executive conference as many other
propositions which he has rejected
have been.
The railroad presidents, states the
advices, offered to leave the appoint
ment of such a board to the president
and the only stipulation they made
was that it be disinterested in the de
mands of the railroads and trainmen.
The board would probe the demands
of both sides, taking three months or
any period President Wilson would
designate to do so. The probe com
pleted, the board would make its re
port and the report would be. accepted
by both sides and allowed to become
effective September 1 this year.
On the rejection of that offer, the
presidents offered to eliminate all de-i
mands they have made in the dispute
and arbitrate the demands of the
trainmen exclusively. The brother
hoods, the advices state, rejected that
offer Immediately and have taken
their stand squarely behind Wilson
in his demand that the railroads grant
an 8-hour basic day which, it is
pointed out, means higher wages for
the trainmen.
A Complicated Question.
Figures compiled recently by" both
sides in the controversy show that the
wage dispute Involved is a compli
cated one. Ordinarily controversies
about wages may be readily under
stood, as they are virtually simple
problems in addition. Mechanics and
laborers are paid at a stated rate an
hour for each day's work. Carpen
ters in Topeka are paid 45 cents an
hour and 8 full hours of work and
no less make up a day, so for each
day's work a carpenter receives 93.60.
The method of paying railroad train
service employes is not so simple, be
ing computed on a dual basis, both
hours worked and miles run and the
employes get the benefit of whichever
basis is the more favorable to him.
For example, the engineer on the San
ta Fe freight train running between
Topeka and Atchison, a distance of
fifty miles, which he covers both ways
each work day. is paid $5.05 for the
round trip of 100 miles, whether he
complete the trip in six hours or in
ten hours. If it takes him longer
than ten hours he is paid extra at the
rate of eight mills for each additional
minute that he works. Should it re
quire twelve hours to make the trip,
he would be paid J6.03 for his day's
work.
One Sided Plan.
In other words, while the railroad
company must pay for any overtime
the man may work, which is proper, it
does not receive any benefit from any
I saving in time under ten hours, and
! cannot use the man in any other work
i till the ten hours are completed with-
out it pays him for an additional full
i day.
.President wnson s oner to tne rail
roads, as stated in press dispatches,
would mean that the man on the above
run would be paid a minimum of $5.05,
the rate he is now paid for ten hours'
work for the suggested eight hour
basic day, and he would receive in
addition overtime for each minute
worked in excess of eight hours at
the rate of 1 cent and one-half mills
per minute; so that under the pro
posed basis for ten hours work, for
which he is now paid 5.05, he would
receive $6.31, an increase of $1.26.
equivalent to 25 per cent. If it should
take him twelve hours to make the
trip, he would receive $7.57, as against
$6.03 under the present schedule.
It will be seen from the above that
there is quite a difference between
paying for eight hours actual work as
in the case of mechanics snd paying
a rate for a complete eight hour day
for less than eight hours' work.
Increase of 46 Per Cent.
It is also contemplated in the propo
sition of the men that for all time
worked in excess of eight hours the
railroads shall pay time and one-half,
and on such a proposition, if the en-

TAKE KASTORIA!
Now Allies Cry For It; Bulgars
Get There First.
Seize Five Greek Villages to
Forestall Drive.
Athens, Aug. 22. The occupation
of Kastoria and Corytsa by the Bul
garian troops is confirmed. News
from an official source says that the
German field marshal. August von
Mackkenzen, is with the Bulgarians.
The military movements of the en
tente allies are hindered by the flight
of the civil population before the Bul
garian advance.
Kastoria is twenty-five miles south
of Mona?tir on the extreme left of the
entente front in Macedonia. It lies
about thirty miles southwest of Fio
rina and its occupation indicates that
the Bulgarians are pressing southward
their movement on the allied) left
flank. Von Mackenzen was reported
at Kovel in July to direct operations
e.ainst the Russians in Volynia.
Bulbars Advance in Greece.
Berlin, Aug. 22. Bulgarian troops
have caotured five Greek villages and
j towns since the beginning of their gen
; ural offensive against the allied forces
! in the Balkans, said an official state
ment from the Bulgarian war office,
today
The Bulgarian statement discloses
that the advance was begun because
of the activities of the allies, who ap
parently were preparing for an of
fensive movement. ,
"On account of military operation
of the allies in the Vardar Valley, ex
tending to east of the Struma and
north of Tachina lake, our left wing
began a general offensive on August
18," it was stated.
"Bulgarian troops advanced in the
Struma Valley and occupied the town
of Demirhissar, (forty-six miles north
east of Saloniki and ten miles inside
the Greek frontier) rter an engage
ment near the town of Serres, we re
pulsed English and French force on
the right bank of the River Struma
and occupied the left bank between
Butkova and the Tachino lakes. De
tachments between the Struma and
Mesta advanced in accordance with
orders.
Report on Bugar Victories.
"In the Vardar Valley, English and
French troops have attacked our ad
vanced positions for ten days without
success south and west of the town of
Doiran, suffering havy looses from
our infantry and artillery fire.
"Our right wing, after a victory over
the Serbians near Fiorina, successfully
pursued our plans.
"Yesterday we occupied the railway
stations of Bantiza and Ekshisu on
the railroad from Saloniki to Fiorina
and re-established railroad communi
cation with Monastir. South of Presba
Lake (extreme northwestern Greece)
we occupied the villages of Zuezdabio
lithea and Bresnitza, thus interrupting
definitely the communications be
tween Goritxha and Fiorina as well as

REPEAL OF THE SUNDAY LAW
Next Legislature Will Be Con
fronted With Problem.
Screens to Be Used in Most Ef
fective Fight.
. Bleeding Kansas, which shed blood
for abolition, proh ibition and woman's
suffrage, must bleed again this time
for movie censorship. A fi$;ht, bitter
and backed by thousands and thou
sands cf dollars, is just beginning to
open in Kansas for the repeal or utter
rout of the present principle of mov
ing; picture censorship. This much
became known after an hour's grill- i
ing in the Hotel Throop this morning
prior to the opening of the convention
of the Motion Picture Kxhibitors'
league and the Amusement Association
of Kansas.
Absolute repeal of the movie censor
ship law will be demanded of all can
didates for state legislature and sen
atorial positions this year thru the
medium of a power, reached and read
with as much interest as the daily
newspapers'of Kansas. It is no other
than the movie screens of the motion
picture houses of Kansas.
Repeal of the Sunday closing law
in Kansas is a secondary affair. E. R.
Pearson of Kansas City, a member of
the executive committee of the Amuse
ment Association of Kansas, admitted
today. Repeal of censorship will be
demanded at firet, he declared, ana
second, if repeal fails, the motion pic
ture men of Kansas wiH urge that
something other than the present
censorship law be demanded at the
next session of the legislature.
He Charges Politics.
Mr. Pearson declared that politics
is being played by the movie censors
of Kansas and that exposes ot this
fact would be made at the business
meetings .to , be held during .the con-,
vention. "Added" to other disagreeable
facts regarding movie picture censor
ship is the fact ' that . the state - has
more than $20,000 of the money of
the film companies over and above
all expenses of censorship.
With the hot fight in view, the
movie picture men of Kansas as well
as the film companies have done
everything possible to make the next
three days' convention a success. As
a result of their efforts nearly as
many movie stare have been obtained
for the movie ball at Garfield park
Wednesday night as appeared at the
national convention of film manufac
tures and exhibitors at Chicago. A
business meeting was held at 2
o'clock today.

On Wednesday, will the movie men

parade prizes will be awarded by a

Washington. Aug. 22. The greatest
industrial struggle in the history of
the country hangs in the balance to
day. - ' .
The question of acceptance or reject
tion of the proposals made by Presi
dent Wilson in an effort to avert a
strike that would tie up the railroads
of the country has now been passed to
the men whose money is invested in
the great arteries of the nation's trade.
As the situation ctands this after
noon the employes have put their
demands for an eight-hour day and
time and a half overtime in the hands
of the president. He has put it up to
the reads of the great dybtems and
they, in turn, have passed it on td
the directors. After an all-night ses
sion, the select committee of "big
barons" appointed by the two score
executives failed to reach any decision
early today. Then they wired their
directors, and upon the reply from
the money powers behind the coun
try's transportation system largely
rests the final result.
Costs S2S,000 a Day.
In the meantime the high salaried
railroad executives continued to wres
tle with the various negotiations.
Counting the salaries and expenses of
the various railroad heads and union
officials, the negotiations are costing
between $25,000 and $30,000 a day,, it
is estimated.
There is no doubt that a division
exists among the railroad heads.
Against one faction, which favors .
"trading" with the president in accept
ing the eight hour day principle is an-'
other group violently opposed to any '
step that would weaken their starrd
demanding arbitration on all matters.
A short session attended by all of
the two score railroad presidents, was
held during the morning,, but adjourn
ed at noon until fi o'clock this evening. -In.
the meantime, it was announeed
the select committee . composed of
eight presidents of the leading roads
and headed by Hale Holden. will con

Washington. Aug. 22. The question
of strike or no strike today was in the
hands of the "Big Barons" of the
railway world. A limited number of
the heads of the country's biggest sys

president and gain some "offsetting
advantages," some "adequate compen

as "a revolutionary change" in - the
eight-hour day. -----
