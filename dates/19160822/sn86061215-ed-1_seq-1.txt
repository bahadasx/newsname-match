CRUX OF FIGHT
(Railroad Heads Object to
President's Plan for
Averting: Strike
pTILL HOPING TO
SOLVE DIFFICULTY
Men Send Delegations to
Congressmen to Post
Them on Situation
Washington, D. C., Aug. 21,—
President Wilson today reiterated
to the railroad executives, includ
ing the new arrivals from the
west, his demand that they accept
his plan for the settlement of the
threatened railroad strike. The
executive then began the first of
aeries of meetings in which
they will frame their reply.
The president pointed out to the
railroad executives that the rail
roads play an important part in
the military preparedness of the
country and that as they are a vlt
al part of the industrial frame
work of the nation it was ab
solutely necessary to keep them
running at the present time.
Mrl Wilson said he did not
blame the railroad executives for
fighting for the principle of arbi
tration but that he believed under
present circumstances they should
accept the eight hour day and
leave the working out of the prin
clple of arbitration until later.
Washington, D. C„ Aug. 21. —Presi
dent Wilson called the railroad presi
dents to the white house again this af
ternoon for another conference which
.was to begin at 2:30 o'clock.
The railway heads spent several
hours in conference today.
One of the suggestions the railroad
presidents were prepared to make at
tiie white house was for legislation to
create a board or commission to inves
I tigate when trouble threatens between
railroad employers and employes.
Under such a plan the board would
be created by act of congress and
would probably be empowered to ex
amine witnesses to determine the
merits of any controversy. Pending
its decision the employes would not be
permitted to strike or take a strike
vote. After the board had reached its
conclusions from the facts, a public re
port would be made and there would
be opportunity for arbitration but it
would not be compulsory. If arbitra
tion were refused the board would
send to each employe of the railroad
Interested a statement of the railroad's
position in the matter, the employes'
position and the board's findings.
These statements would be before
every employe when he came to vote
on a strike and opportunity would be
given for a secret ballot. The men
would vote directly on the question of
a strike. Under the present system the
ballot is not secret and the men vote
to delegate the power of declaring a
strike to brotherhood officers.
Leaders of the railroad executives
declared they were united against the
president's plan as it stands and hoped
to agree on some form of counter pro
posal.
The railroad presidents were consid*
ering under what circumstances they
could find a way to accept the eight
hour day basis and still conserve the
principle of arbitration which has be
come the crux of the whole fight.
No conference between President
Wilson and the railway executives is
expected before tomorrow afternoon.
The men, after a brief meeting to
day, adjourned until tomorrow await
ing developments and meanwhile sent
delegates tf congressmen to acquaint
them with details of the controversy.
The situation continued, as both
sides expressed it, serious but not
hopeless.
Westerners Arrive.
The western railway presidents
summoned Saturday began coming in
this morning. Louis W. Hill of the
Great Northern, principal heir to the
vast properties of the late James J.
Hill, and E. P. Ripley, the veteran
president of the Santa Fe, were among
the first. Neither had any statement
to make.

ENOUGH DEMOCRAT8 JOIN RE­
PUBLICANS TO BRING UP IM­
MIGRATION MEA8URE.
Washington, D. C., August 21.—By
27 to 24 the senate today voted to take
up the immigration bill, which the
democratic caucuB had determine^ to
postpone until next session. Nine
democrats voted with republicans for
the motion.
When debate on the provisions re
lating to Asiatics was begun the gal
leries were cleared and consideration
of those features proceeded in secret.
Passage of the bill seemed assured
by today's action and it was predicted
the bill would be brief. President
Wilson vetoed the bill last year be
cause of the literacy test.
Some democratic senators believe
the president will not veto the bill
again, although it retains the literacy
test to which he then objected.
The motion to take up the bill was
made by Senator Smith of South Car
olina, chairman of the Immigration
committee. The committee has
amended the house bill in an effort to
meet objections of Japan to the sec
tions relating to Asiatic exclusion.

Indications Are That the
Allies Are Preparing
Balkan Offensive
BULGARIANS MOVE
UPON GREEK PORT
Russians Announce Gains on
Stokhod Britons Advance
on the Western Front
Paris, Aug. 21.—Italian troops be
gan to disembark at Saloniki yester
day, says the Havas dispatch from
that point.
On leaving their tfhips, the dispatch
says, the Italians passed through
Saloniki to camp, preceded by military
bands of the allies and cheered by the
populace.
Active participation by Italian
troops in the Saloniki campaign would
mean the existence of a state of war
between Germany and Italy. Germany
is directing the operations against the
allies on this front, and, as the offi
cial German reports show, has forces
there. Some Austrian troops also
probably are employed and possibly
Turks but the major portion of the
army is made up of Bulgarians. Re
cent reports have indicated the with
drawal of Austrian troops from the
Balkans for use on the Russian and
Italian fronts.
As the entente allies are believed to
have a force of some 700,000 British,
French and Serbian troops on the
Saloniki front, the sending of rein
forcements at this time, just after the
opening of hostilities on a large scale,
would indicate that the allies have em
barked on a campaign of extensive
proportions.
Italy, which has a considerable sur
plus of troops', has been urged to take
a more active part in the Balkan oper
ations but was believed to have re
frained partly on account of the fact
that she was not at war with Germany.
There have been several recent indi
cations, however, that declaration of
hostilities was forthcoming. A com
mercial treaty between these nations
was abrogated, a German court ruled
that Germany is/ actually, though not
formally at war with Italy, and last
week it was reported that the defense
of Triest would be taken over by Ger
mans.
Italian participation in the Balkan
operations hitherto has been limited
to the Albanian port of Avlona, which
was effected before Italy declared war
on Austria.
WAR SUMMARY.
On the Verdun front the Germans
are making determined efforts to re
gain Fleury. Last night they drove
against the village with strong forces
using flaming liquid, but according to
today's Paris bulletin were repulsed.
Along the Somme front in Northern
France, the artillery battle is raging
violently. No further actions are re
ported by Paris, however, although
a German counter attack apparently
is in preparation following the capture
by the French of a strongly fortified
wood between Gulllemont and Maure
pas, northwest of Peronne, announced
last night.
The Russians appear to be center
ing their efforts on anew drive toward
Kovel and Petrograd'says they have
taken a series of heights in that vicin
ity. Hard fighting continues on the
crest of the Carpathians, where the
Russians are battling in sight of the
plains of Hungary.
On the Salonki front fighting is
growing in intensity over a long bat
tle line from Lake Presaba to Lake
Doiran. Both the Bulgarians and the
entente allies claim minor successes.
COUNTER ATTACK FUTILE.
Paris, Aug. 21.—The attempted Ger
man-Bulgarian counter offensive on
both flanks of the entente allies' front
in Macedonia," with the apparent in
tention of hindering the plans of Gen.
Sarrall, the entente commander, will

body of Mrs. Catherine Labello and
two children, a baby about six months

children. The woman, the police say,
has been dead three or four days. The
children were rushed to a hospital.
Four men are under arrest.

PIECE OF LAND AT
CANAL TERMINAL
UNITED 8TATE8 GOVERNMENT IS
INVESTIGATING REPORTED
PANAMA DEAL.
Washington, D. C., Aug. 21.—Inves
tigations of reports from Panama that
a 80,000 acre land commission at the
Atlantic end of the canal Is being
sought by a Spaniard named Fernan
dez presumably for Japanese Interests,
was ordered today by Secretary Lan
sing. Mr. Lansing Tefused to discuss
the report in detail but it was con
sidered significant that the depart
ment should commehce its action.
Rumors of a similar nature have
been common ever since the canal was
well under way.
The present reports are that Fern
andez, Havana agent for Japanese in
terests, secured a 60,000 acre land con
cession through the activity of Ramon
Valdes, whose recent election to the
presidency of Panama may possibly be
disputed by the United States because
of alleged frauds and coercion.
Admiral Concas, of the Spanish
navy, selected by the Panama govern
ment as umpore to settle the dispute
with the United States over the pur
chase price of canal property, is al
leged to have given valuable informa
tion about the canal itself.
AT BIG MEETING
TWENTY THOUSAND DELEGATES
IN ATTENDANCE AT CONVEN
TION IN NEW YORK.
New York, Aug. 21. —Business ses
sions of the American Federation of
Catholic societies and allied organiza
tions began here today with nearly
20,000 delegates attending.
"Catholic week" with a series of
meetings and ceremonials which are
to continue to and Include Friday, was
inaugurated yesterday with a ponti
fical high mass in St.. Patrick's cath
edral attended by three cardinals and
the apostolic delegate, as well as most
of the delegates to the federation.
This was followed by a mass meeting
of the federation which brought out
15,000 delegates in the evening to lis
ten to addresses by Cardinals Gibbons,
O'Connell and Farley and others.
The opening session today was de
voted in part to hearing'the reports
of the national president, John Whar
len, and of the national secretary, An
thony Matre. An address was deliv
ered by the Rt. Rev. M. J. Lavelle, rec
tor of St. Patrick's cathedral.
Social service problems will be con
sidered at a mass meeting this evening
at which Bishop Muldoon pf Rockford,
111., will deliver the opening address.
The minimum wage and living wages
for working women will be among the
subjects discussed.
Rap Administration.
The federal administration was as
sailed today at business sessions of
the American Federation of Catholic
societies. Anthony Matre, secretary of
the federation, said that Catholic pro
tests to the government against the
recognition of Carranza were like "a
voice in the wilderness."
At a meeting of the German Cath
olic Central Vereln the administration
was charged with favoritism toward
the entente allies in an address by
Charles Korz, president of the New
York state body.
Mr. Matre in his annual report dwelt
at some length on Mexican affairs.
Speaking of the recognition of Carran
za he said: "Despite our honorable
protests the arch persecutor of the
church in Mexico was recognized and
the voice of 16,000,000 Catholics was
like one crying in the wilderness."
RRTE CUT IS PERKITTEO
Washington, D. C., Aug. 21. —The in
terstate commerce commission has de
clined to suspend proposed reduced
rates on bituminous coal over the Chi
cago and Alton railroad from Illinois
mines to Kansas City, Mo., and the
rates will become effective at mid
night.
The present rate is $1.90 a ton on
Black coal and the rate effective to
night will be $1.25. Railroads trans
porting coal from the fields in Mis
souri, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kansas
opposed the reduction on the ground
that they could not compete with the
Illinois coal under the new rates be
cause coal can be mined cheaper In
Illinois than in those states.
The commission's decision does not
affect the right of shippers to oonv
Eave
laln against the new rate if they he
It unjust.

WOULD LOOK AFTER
WORK OF THE MEN
New Officer to Be at Head
of All Transferring
and Land Platting
Wapello county officials are interest
ed in the movement now on foot in
Iowa, to have the i*ext legislature em
power the board of supervisors to ap
point a county assessor. All of the of
ficers at the recent state convention in
Davenport were in favor of the plan
and will take steps toward its realiza
tion when the legislature meets this
winter.
The holder of this new office, which
would be created by the assembly,
would be appointed for four years. He
would have charge of all real estate,
transfers and would keep the plat
books. The assessors, who are elected
from all parts of the county, would be
under his direct supervision. He sim
ply acts as their head and would meet
once a year in Des Moines with the
executive council. The consensus of
opinion at the convention was that a
man appointed would be much better
qualified to act than one who was
elected. There is no one now who has
an authority over the assessors. The
auditor meets with them several times
a year to give out supplies.
The ouditors, recorders and super
visors in session at Davenport, alsft
went on record as favoring a change in
the revenue laws of the state. Many
of the rules on taxation are now re
garded as obsolete and greatly in need
of revision. The idea Is to get the
taxation on a more equal basis. Tlio
convention also favored the placing of
actual valuations In the deed in a
transfer of property.
BRUTAL BANDIT
SLAYS CAPTIVES
El Paso, Tex., Aug. 21.—The story
of a Villa chief with his own hands
cutting off the ears of twenty prison
ers, who later were shot, is told by a
rescued prisoner in El Democrata, of

rived here yesterday. The chief who
committed the atrocity was Baudello
Uribe, commander during Villa's re
cent raid on Jiminez.
Uribe captured a small body of de
facto government soldiers, according
to the witness, and called on them to
join his band. Twenty failed to re
spond. Finding them stubborn, Uribe
trimmed their ears and then ordered
a captain to shoot them. This order
was carried out Ju3t as a rescuing
party came up.
The bodies were recovered by the
government troops.
REVENUE BILL IS
TARGET FOR G. O. P.
Washington, D. C., Aug. 21.— The
administration revenue bill was taken
up for consideration in the senate to
day with vigorous opposition to the
measure promised.
Republican leaders propose to make
the bill the target for political at
tack, while some democrats are to op
pose certain features, including the
wine tax section and the section to
tax manufacturers of materials enter
ing Into munitions of war 5 per cent
on their net profits. Senator Under
wood will attack the proposals for a
tariff commission and increased tariff
duties on dyestuffs on the ground that
both are undemocratic.
