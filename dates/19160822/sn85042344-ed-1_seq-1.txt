in
TtlK proposed legislative program
of President Edgar S. Kenton
will lie the crux around which In
terest will center at today's session
of the Oklahoma State Federation
of Labor, which opened Its thir
teenth annual convention at the
Grand opera house yesterday fore
noon. Monday was spent In hearing vari
ous reports, the appointment of com
mittees ami- other routine matters,
hut this morning the convention will
get down to actual business and a
hit; s'orm is expected to arise when
the workman's compensation law
(nines up for consideration. Pres
ident Kenton has proposed several
amendments to the law, but they are
not drastic enough in tho opinion of
the miners and carpenters' unions
of the state, and these two organiza
tions, through their delegates, will
make a fight on tho floor of the
convention for the elimination of
several provisions in tho measure,
notably the clause that prevents a
workman from filing suit for dam
ages afler his employer has offered
to settle his cuse under the schedule
named in the law. It is possible
that certain delegates will ask the
convention to go on record in favor
of the repeal of tho law in Its en
tirety. Will Have Support.
However, as President Kenton and
Secretary Ollle S. Wilson constitute
the legislative committee and are
the sole representatives of the fed
eration before tho state legislature,
It is likely that a large number of
the delegates will be in favor of ap
proving the president's program.
The convention opened yesterday
morning. Mayor John H. Simmons
delivered the address of welcome,
which was responded to by Kdgar S.
Kenton. George B. Johnson, pres
ident of the Trades and Labor Coun
cil of Tulsa, extended a welcome In
behalf of the trade unionists of this
city. The invocation was pronounced
by Uev. L. S. Harton, pastor of the
lioston avenue M. E. church, Tulsa.
The credentials committee sub
mitted a partial report, giving the
list of delegates In attendance. This
list was materially lir'reased last
night, and others are to arrive to
day. The convention will last until
Wednesday night, and may extend
until Thursday If the business war
rants. Yesterday afternoon, following ad
journment, the visitors were taken
to Sand Springs by tho local recep
tion committee on chartered Inter
urbun cars. They spent an enjoy
able evening at the park and re
turned at 7 o'clock.
May Ik- an "Insurgent."
The only disordant note yesterday
arose when a miner delegate arose
and objected to the action of the
slate officers In mailing printed
copies of their annual reports to
unions throughout the state, ahead
of the convention. Secretary Wilson,
in replying to the attack, explained
that the anion complained of was
authorized by the constitution, del
egate Harry Hplgerson made a point
of order on the ground that the mat
ter should he presented to the proper
committee and tho presiding officer
sustained him.
The afternoon session was occu
pied largely by the reading of of
ficers' and standing committee re
ports. All of the reports were opti
mistic and proved that the past year
has been the best twelve months in
the history of organized labor In the
state from every standpoint.
The report of the legislative com
mittee dealt largely with the extraor
dinary session of the legislature held
' last January, at which time the labor
representatives confined their efforts
largely to opposing the passage of
the convict mine bill and the uni-
versal registration law. They sue
! ceeded in defeating the former rneas
i ure but the registration act became
'. a law. With regards to this Wil
: Hams machine measure, the commit
tee said: "It affords a means of
building a partisan political machine
j that should not be permitted and
which labor does not desire."

Plain That U. S. Is

WSSHIM-.T'iN, Aug. 21 The na.
tional guard wi'.l be retained on
the Mexican border until It can be
withdrawn without again endanger
ing American lies and property. Sec
retary Haker so declared the adminis
tration's policy today In answering n
score of letters from many parts of'
the country complaining that the state!
troops were being held In service aft
er the emergency for which they were
called out apparently had passed.
In general tho complainants whose
names were withheld alleged that
bolder service was entailing loss fi
nancially on militiamen and hardships
on their families. Hy Its presence on
tho border, he wrote to one, thci
guard is "winning bloodless victories
daily." He declared that Americans;
resident along the international line1
wire enjoying a peace and security 1
they cou'.d not know without the mil
itary fortes to protect them. I
"The department appreciates," Mr. I
Baker said in another letter, "the fact I
that a call for military service upon
militia organizations must inevitably
present cases of hardship." He ad
ded: "The emergency, however, wfilch i
reipilred this call for the militia, was'
one of a grave character, affecting the ,
safety and lives of citizens of the
Inited States, men. women and chll-'
dren. The presence of the militia on !
the Mexican border has restored order
and given a higher degree of safety
and security to the lives of our peo
ple in that troubled country than they
have had for a long time. The mili
tia is therefore performing a valuable
servce- and the fact that this service
Is being performed without Pctlve mil
itary operations entailing loss of life
to our soldiers, is a cause of congratu
lation and happiness."
Referring to the elaborate and ex
tensive training the militiamen are
receiving under supervision of regu
lar nrmy officers the secretary ex
pressed the opinion that it would fit
them to act In time of wtr or other
emergency as a supih Ing arm or
second line for the regular army, fur
nishing an asset to national pre
paredness that could not have been
otherwise obtained.
Clearly, so soon as a restored state
of order on the border Justifies It,

statement follows:
"On August 20 the ,i)lie, fores at

significant when It is remembered

WASHINGTON. Aug. SL An un

gration bill being taken up In defiance
of the I X'lnocratlc caucus and opened
the way for efforts to displace the
revenue bill as unfinished business,
an action which might Indefinitely
prolong the session of congress.
Ten Democratic senators voted
Willi the solid Itep'ibllcan minority to
take up the immigration bill upon a
motion by Senator Smith of South
Carolina, chairman of the immigra
tion committee. They were: Ashurst.
Beckham, Chamberlain, Culberson,

Debate began on the measure Im
mediately and procerdi d until 2

Senator Smith then moved to dis
place the revenue bill, provoking an
all-afternoon discussion which will be
resumed when the senate meets to
morrow. Administration lenders aid

of the revolting Democrats have de

Senator Stone, chairman of the for

"It turns over to the Republican

said Senator Stone.
Senator Smith Insisted that the Im

"In view of some of the revelations
that have come in this country since

FLAG IN FACES
OF RAIL HEADS
Regs Railroad Executives
to Accept His Plan to
Avert Disaster.
PRESIDENTS HOLD
OUT TO ARBITRATE
More Conferences Today, as
Deadlock in Strike
Issue Stands.
WASHINGTON'. Aug. 2.A ono
American citizen to another,
President Wilson today appealed to
each of tho executive of the coun
try's principal railroads on grounds of
patriotism to accept his plan for
averting the threatened disaster of a
nation-wide slrike. Ho emphasized
the necessity for keeping the rail,
roads In service as a part of tho na
tional defense and tn make possible
preparation fr meeting conditions
that will exist after the furope.-n
war.
n leaving the White Houso the
rail road presicienla, augmented dur
rig the day by arrivals from the west,
held a conference at which Hentlment
was suidN, be against agreeing to the
president's proposal In its present
form. Hope was expressed, however,
that some satisfactory counter prop
osition might be advanced, and It was
decided to turn oyer to a committee
the task of drafting a final reply to
the president. With more than sixty
men, most of them with their own
Ideas about what ought to bo done,
the executives found it difficult to
"get down to brass tacks" as one of
them expressed it. Tomorrow morn
ing another meeting will be held and
every effort will he imulo to reach a
decision promptly.
The rullroad heads still Insist that
President Wilson is asking them to
sacrifice the principle of arbitration.
K'llsha I'e, chairman of the national
conference committee of railways. Is
sued u statement tonight In which lio
sulci:
"That the railroads should grant
under threat of a national strike a
$,ri0.000,(l00 wage preferment to a
small minority of their employes
without a hearing before a publln tri
bunal is Inconceivable In a-cleinocrac y
like ours. All ouesllons nt Issue
wages, hours, costs, operating condi
tions are submerged ,y the great Is
sue: Shall arbitration be abandoned
In the settlement of Industrial dis
putes'.'" The statement suggests, however,
that railroads stand ready to lake
whatever action tho people and the
country desire. It concludes:
Public Must Decide.
"The weight of public nnlrilon
must determine this issue. We can
not believe that it Is the calm Judg
ment of the country that we should
sacrifice the principle of arbitration
In industrial disputes under a threat
to tie up the commerce of tho coun
try." While the officials were listening
to President Wilson and later con
ferring at their hotel, the general
committee of 640 representatives of
the employes who already havo ac
cepted the president's plan held a
perfunctory meeting and marked
time awaiting the decision of the em
ployers. He said they would wait
until President Wilson dismissed
them, but stood ready to call a strlko
should the negotiations fail.
Although ft few of the railroad ex
eeutlves Invited had not arrived this
evening. It was decided those already
In Washington were representative
and therefore the president called
them to the White House and ear
nestly urged that his plan of settle
ment bo ratified.
The railroad executives did not
enter into an argument with the
president, hut Hale Hidden, president
of the Iturlington and spokesman for
the roads, promised deep considera
tion of the plan and said the offi
cials would endeavor to reach an
agreement as soon as possible.
Messages on the situation contin
ued to arrive at the White House all
day. Many upheld the president's
position and many others urged him
to support the railroads In their de
ncanil for arbitration.
Worr't Make Comment.
A. It. Cirretson. spokesman for
the brotherhoods, decline .1 tonight to
make any comment on the railroad
managers' statement. Any reply to
it, be said, would be in the form of
an official statement tomorrow'.
Mr. Lee's statement follows In
part:
"That the railroads should grant
under threat of a national strike a
$.-,n.iiiif),IMni wage pcifcrtnent to a
small minority of their employes
without a he-. cling beforo a public
tribunal is inconceivable in a de
mocracy like ours. All cuesticns at
