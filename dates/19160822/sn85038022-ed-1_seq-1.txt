alao argued that according to the evi

In the keeping of tho hogs.
City Attorney Calhoun arnued that
the city did not want to take the right
of keeping hogs in the Sixth Ward
away from the people but that since
the Board of Health had declared them
a nuisance they would have to be re
moved. He spoke rather lengthly up
on the statement of Dr. W. S. Yazell

Appeal
Washington, August 21 As one
American citizen to another, Presi
dent Wilson today appealed to each
of the executives of the country's prln
clpal railroada on the grounds of pa
triotism to accept his plan for avert
ing the disaster of a nation-wide
strike. He emphasized the necessity
for keeping the railroads In service
as a part of the national defense, and
to make possible preparations for
meeting conditions that will exist aft
er the European war.
On leaving the White House, the
railroad president, augmented during
the day by arrivals from the West
held a conference at which sentiment
was said to be against agreeing to the
President's proposal in Its present
from. Hope was expressed, however
that, some satisfactory counter propo
sition might be advanced, and it was
decided to turn over to a committee
the task of drafting a final reply to
the President. With more than sixty
men, moat of them with their own
ideas about what ought to be done!
the executives found it difficult tr
"get down to brass tacks," as one of
them expressed. Tomorrow morninp.
another meeting will be held and ev
cry effort will be made to reach
decision promptly.
Public Opinion Last Judge
The railroad heads still insist that
President Wilson Is asking them to
sacrifice the principle of arbitration
iClisha l.iv, chairman of the National
Conference Committee on Hallways
issued a statement tonight. In which
I'.e said:
"That the railroada should grant
under threat of a national strike,
$50,000,000 wage preferment to
small minority of their employes
without a hearing before a public tri
bunal, in inconceivable in a democ
racy like ours. All questions at Issue
wageH, hours, coat, operating condi
tions are submerged by the greater
J-min- oliall arbitXiUkax be abandon
ed In the settlement of Industrial dis
putes?''
The statement suggests, however
that the railroads stand ready to Take
whatever action the people of the
country desire. It concludes:
"The weight of public opinion must
determine this Issue. We can not b
lleve that It Is the calm judgment cf
the country that we should sacrifice
the principles of arbitration in Indus
trial disputes under a threat to tie
up the commerce of the country."
Kmployen Ready to Strike
While the officials were listening to
President Wilson, and later confer
rlpg at their hotel, the general com
mittee of 640 representatives of the
employes who already have accepted
the President's plan, held a perfunc
tory meeting and marked time await
lug the decision of tho employers
They said they would wait until Pres
ident Wilson dismissed them, but
stood ready to call a strike should the
negotiations fall. Although a few of
the railroad etxecutlvea had not ar
rived this afternoon, it was decided
that those already In Washington were
representatives and therefore the
President called them to the WThlte
House and earnestly urged them that
his plan of aettlement be ratifler
Messages on the situation continued
to arrive at the White House all day.
Many upheld the President's position
uud many other urged him to support
the railroads in their demand for arbl
t rat ion.
ivtitiona signed by 20,000 non-union
employes of the Pennsylvania railroad
opposing the strike of the members
of the four great brotherhoods were
taken to the White House during the
dny, making a total of 80,000 signs
inn s attached to such petitions.
A. n Oarretson, spokesman for the
Brotherhoods, declined tonight to
make any comment on the railroad
management's statement.

ASPHALT PLANT

Hums at Lexington Ye,
tenia y Afternoon.
Lexington, Ky., August 22 With a
loBs of about $1,000 and no Insurance,
the asphalt mixing plant of the Carey
Reed Company, on West Second street,
was destroyed by fire yesterday after
noon. The monetary loss Is not bo
much as the loss of- time in filling
contracts for work on the city streets
George B. Carey stated yeaterday, but
he thought work could be resumed it
about a week.
The fire originated tVom a burstine.
oi an oil pipe near a valve, which
was being turned off tiy George Wll-
gtiB, drum fireman. The oil Imme
diately took fire because of its prox
imity to the furuves and badly burn
ed Mr. Wilgus about the race. He,
however, continued his work of cut
ting off the valves to prcTent further
spread of tho oil.
A few minutes alter the pipe burst
the building was a ttajss of flames.
ine neat was bo intense from tne
I timing oil that the firemen had
t.ouble getting close enough to pla
tho water on It. The steel under
pinning of the mixing tanka buckled
under the heat and the mixing tanks
v are precipitated on the furnaces.
Two storage tanks for the oil were
only a few feet away, but they did not
lake fire or explode.
ThiB lire will probably delay the
work on the asphalt streets for Rome
time. It is hoped that the fire loss will
not be so great as first supposed an 1
that the work will not be postponed in
thin city.
