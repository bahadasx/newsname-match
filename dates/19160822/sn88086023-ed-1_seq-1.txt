NO TRACE IS LEFT
OF BEAVER COLONY
SUSPICION ENTERTAINED THAT
TRAPPERS HAVE EXTERMI
N VIED ANIMALS OH
Ml HAM CREEK..
What ha become of the beaver COl-1
any that was growing and thriving on
Meacham creek?
Hunters anil fishers, who have been
familiar with the Industrious family
of water animals in the mountains
east of here, are asking that ques
tion now. The former home of the
colony in this year deserted and there
is a strong suspicion that human
hamls have had something to do with
its disappearance.
Three years ago Teddy Hauswirth
and C. B. Roosevelt, on their return
from a hunting trip, reported having
seen the colony at the mouth of the
east fork ot Meacham creek. ither
sportsmen made similar reports, ijtst
week Hauswirth was hunting m the
vicinity ami made a special trip to
look at the beaver. He was surprised
to find no sign of any of the anlmala
there, despite the fact that last year
he visited the same place and found
that they had multiplied greatly since
hta former visit
1 Their dams and houses were still
there trot no Indication that any an
imals had been about for some time.
The beaver is protected in Oregon
and has been for some years. Time J
was when the streams of the state
were alive with the fur bearers. It
is Just possible that someone, during
the past winter, defied the law and
exterminated the colony on Meacham
creek for the sake of the furs

CHURCH UNITY MOVE
SEEMS TO HAVE MET
SOME OPPOSITION
Because of some opposition, the
Church Unity organization which was
to have been perfected last night,
failed to materialize A number ot
representatives from the four young
peoples societies of the Christian.
Baptist. Methodist and Presbyterian
churches met at the Preebyterian
church last night to arrange the final
details of the club.
The four ministers of the churches
were invited to attend the meeting,
but Rev. Clevenger is the only one
who is in the city at present. Rev.
Chwragw declared that he was not
in favor of the movement and was
not authorized to act for the Baptist
society.
The leaders of the movement are
said to be determined that the organ
ization shall be a reality and the prop
otitlon was referred back to the dif
ferent organizations last night where
it will be finally decided. Committees
will then be appointed to confer to
gether on the subject
One of the organizers stated that
; the Idea was that the four societies
j should hold meetings and a social
OBC a month. The purpose should
I be a working body for the mutual
benefit of all. He declared that
i Christian unity from the pulpit was
impossible but that n must come
from the young people who have not
become prejudiced m their denom
inational views.
The societies interested in the
movement are the Epworth League of
the Methodist churen, the Christian
Endeavors of the Christian and Pres
