Large Crowd Presents?Good Dinner
on the Grounds?Beautiful Day.
Sunday Last was a beautiful day. It
was not too hot and it was a fine day
t > drive to the country. MTe went, as
.. we frequently do, to old ;St. Pauls. It
is the church of our childhood days.
It was there that we first went to a
Sunday school. It was in the oli
school house that stood near by thav
we first went to a day school. The
. 'eld school house has been torn away
after it had stood for near a centur-.
A modern one teacher house nov
occupies the site of the old house at
which we first learned to read and to
write. It was taught in those days by
Tfcev. J. A. Sligb. We afterward went
to school to Capt. J. F. Banks and to
faDt. <T7. B. Whites and several lady
teachers in the same old bouse,
though, in those days the man teacher
was the rule even in the one teacher
school, as most of the country schools
were. We had no modern desks in
1hose days and no black boards. We
had "to do our sums". on the slate.
And we took our first writing'lesson
<on the slate. And school "took in" at
8 o'clock and "turned out" at five
o'clock with an hour for dinner and
one or two short recesses. It was an
all day job to go to school then.
Several of tne boys and the girls
who were in school at St. Pauls in
those days were out at Old Folks day
op last Sunday. Many are living in
distant lands and many have gone to
the happy hunting grounds of the
great beyond. And some of those win
were then by us considered old folks
were there too. They have- been
" * 1 ? M i ? *
spared may years uwause uictt wa^? <*
long time ago. The familW faces
or those days, those who were tin
leaders in the church and Sunday
school, were not there. As we sat in
the old church we could see them ani
could place them in their seats in the
church, but they are gone.
It was a beautiful idea, this thing of
observing old folks day. It helps to
keep alive a beautiful and a helpful j
and a healthful sentiment of which
there is great neecV in this age in
w!hich we live. We believe the
idea had its origin with. Grace
church at Prosperity and that it was
Mr. <Ai H. Kohn now of Columbia but
then a member of Grafce church and
the superintendent of the Sunday
-school who suggested the idea. And I
they 'have observed the day regularly
at Grace church and it has come t?
be a fixture. It was undertaken ontv
a year or two ago at -St. Pnuls. It is
a beautiful custom and the pity fi
that more of the old people do not go.t
St. Paul is noted for its large con
gregations on even ordinary occasions
and there was more than a capacity
congregation on Sunday for the church
and many were forced to remain on
The outside.
The older people are fast passing
and as we sat in the church on las
Sunday and thought of those w
we had known and who are now ?o^j
it occurred to us what an interesting
story it w-ould have been if we could
have had the rerollections of the
i * _ ?
cmircn ana its peopie auu yaswic
from Maj. Jacob Epting, for instance,
who -bad known the church and had
been an officer for many years. Or
of Mr. Levi Monts or Mr. Geo. A.
Counts or Mr. Jacob ("X'") Bowers
or 'Mr. Jacob Kibler or any of those j
who are now gone had written out j
their personal recollections what an |
-s J- ? J.J woVA +A !
interesting <iuciilicxx h. ?<uuiu w
the local history of the community
as well as of the church. And we take
the liberty to suggest here that the
members of this congregation have
seme of its members to write or
cause to be written their recollections
of the members of the church and the :
I pastors during their life time. There J
are several yet who remain that could
go back a long way in giving history
I Trom their own recollection. Mr.
John D. Shealy has been an ofneer

member of this consrresza+ior and is
stil! a member of Mt. Tabor which was
formed nit of the membership of I
' St. Pauls large'y. And there are;
others. Mr. David Wicker ?n3:
Mr. Press Kinard could go back
a good many years. We just throw
out this suggestion as ia good way to
preserve some local history of the
community as well as of the church.
The address by Rev. S. P. Koon was
fittinor and aooroDriate to the occasion.
He stressed the value and responsibility
of long- life and the importance
of the young to honor and respect the
aged. He told how the great battles
; the ISuropean war were being le-i
by the old men and gave the young
r?or\niA some -wholesome admonitions
as to their duties and obligations t?
the old. It was our purpose to print
a synopsis of this excellent sermon j
but we find it impossible to get it se: j
|
In the lafternoon the address was
made by Rev. E. F. K. Roof. He spoke
well of the small things of life and
how they affected our own lives.
The day was a very pleasant one
and enjoyed by the large congregation
present. The dinner was boun v.y-.inrii

HPRRTCAJiE HITS
COAST OF TEXAS
Corpus Christ! in Path of Storm.
Considerable Damage Between
There and Brownsrille.
Corpus Christi, Texas, Aug. 18.?
Blowing at a 70 mile an hour velocity
the forerunner of the tropical storm
in the Gulf of Mexico was felt tonight
as it approached the Texas
ccast at this point and Brownsville
and on the intermediate plains.
Tonight the weather bureau station
estimated that the crest of the storm
would reach here about midnight
with the wind at a velocity of probably
120 miles an hour.
But few details of the storm's wct'i
*outh or north of here had oeen received
early tonight. In Corpus i
Christi, however, the gale had car-!
.ried almost every movable thing hefore
it. In its wake it had Mt demniicTiort
alon^: the beach
front here, thousands of dollars damage
to building's in the business section
and a "heavy seat running in
Corpus Christi bay. The waves hioped
over the beach in the northern
section of the cit. beachi"* small
craft land carrying UP <>n the sho
cebris from a score of docks and
sr all bithing pavilions.
Loyd's pier . one of the largest
pleasure resorts in this section of the
-coast, which juts out over the water
1.000 feet, had been almost complet?
1" aemonsnea sll d otiutk
The only portion that remained was a
two story structure adjoining the
shore.
Fronting the business section,
which is built cn the beach proper, is
i:i four foot breakwater. Incoming
heavy seas were dashing over that and
threatened to ^ash over it.
The small freight steamer Piloi"
Boy, owend by the Texai & Gulf
Steamship company of Galveston, was
sunk in the gulf today. One report
received here stated that all the crew
of 12 men were rescued and mnothe?*
reported that three of the crew had
been washed ashore at Port Arkansas.
Thus far there has been no loss of
life in or about Corpus Christi and,
so far as known, none seriously Injured.
(Ample warning of the storm,
it was said, had given residents opportunity
to prepare for the hurricane.
The city of Corpus Christi 's
situated on a boot sir/2d peninsula,
IS miles from the open gulf but sur-j
rounded on three sides by Corpus j,
Ctristi and Neucas bavs. On the'
j
other side of the bay are Mustang and
Padre islands, forming a brenkwater
to any tidal wave that might ap
proach from the gulf. On each side
Oi.' one channel are situated Po:t
Aransas and Aransas Pass. T\*hat
d?mas:e has been done there, howr'

I Disturbance.
First communication with Corpus
Christi, Texas, where Friday's tropica]
storm was believed to have been felt
hardest, showed on, Saturday afteri
noon that no great damage had been
done to the city and that there were
no fatalities there. Portions of thai
city, notably the section populated by
| summer -visitors, were under three
i feet of water yesterday.
I
| Greatest property damage was in
I that quarter where Corpus Christi
I Beach hotel, a large ' summer hotel,
! was considerably shaken.
I Some cottages and a pleasure pier
I ( re demolished.
j The business section of Corpus i
Christi was not damaged beyond the
| breaking of plate glass windows.
| Interest has centered on the effect
of the storm at Port Aransas, and
i Aransas Pass, in the absence of defii
nit* wn-rd from those there. It was
pointed out as probable that these
points might have felt the storm mor ?
severely than Corpus Christi. j
It developed Saturday night when:
further information was obtained that
the fatalities reported during the day
at Rockport hjad been confused with
the drowning of ten men of the crew
o' the steamer Pilot Boy, which sank
oft' Aransas Pass Friday afternoon.!
these were the only deaths from the
storm.
Restored communication with La '
redo, Texas, showed that pjace and
the military camps surrounding it to
have felt a heavy aftermath of thb
storm which hit the coast. The ga'o
raged there for several hours Fridav
n.ght and early Saturday morning tu:
it?. most serious result was flOcdlng
portions of the city to a depth of two

tents..
Messengers who arrived at Sinton,

SUMMER BROTHERS COMPAQ
SERVE DELIGHTFUL BARBECUE
There was a big event in the village
life of Jalapa last Friday. Autos aauV
buggies made this charming litt' I
viilaee the mecca of keen and comin*
r.jpetites.
Jalapa is exactly 7 miles north
vest of Newberry and is situated on
the Piedmont highway. For more
than half a century it was a postoffice
*nd was discontinued) only a few
y% ars ago, the late S. B. Aull being ita
last postmaster.
The postoffice at Gary of which Mr.
I. H. Compton was postmaster, was
discontinued at the same time. Postal
service is now rendered by R. F. D.,
(No. 3 out of Newberry. It is thought
that Jalapa got its name tram a town
ot the same name in Mexico.
But we hiave digressed. We started
out to tell of the free barbecue furnished
by the Summer Bros. Co., at Jalapa.
The 'cue was given by this enter'
prising firm of farmer-merchants as
a token of appreciation of the faithful
work done by their tenants and oyer- ^
seers on the Jalapa and G<ary planta
tions and for the pleasure of a lar.^
number of invited guests from the
neighborhood and from the city. This
firm is conducting a large store at
Jclapa under tTie management of ftlr.
W. Clarence Wallace who is one of
the most promising and obliging
young business men in this section.
Besides the store at Jalapa the Jalap*
plantation is under the management
o? one of the best and most progressive
young farmers in the county, Mr.
E. B. Feagle. Mr. Feagle has under
cultivation about 350 acres of cotton
besides a large acreage of corn and
other crops.
At Gary Mr. R. ML Werts is
monarch, of all the surveys. Be nas
under cultivation some 400 acres in ,
cotton besides a large acreage in other
crops including corn. Mr. C. EJ.
Su-mmer stated that the two plantations
bid produced enough corn in
this year's crop to run until next
year's crop. . Mr. Werts is. well
known as a big farmer in every sen-se
and the transformation at Gary the
past two years is sufficient evidence
of hi3 success as a farmer.
But we have jumped) the track
again. The bjrbecue at Jalapa vras
spread under thick anrl beautiful
shade trees and over 300 people white
and colored were served. The colored
tenants brought their families ana en- x .
joyed the hospitality of their employers.
Parson George Montgomery
who drives one of the Summer drays
pulled one over on the whites. When
ti e negroes were seated at tne t&Dib
he rose in "his dignity and asked tho
blessing?something the white fol-ks
iud forgotten. Parson Montgomery
also made a speech of appreciation
on befcalf of His fellow-laborers.
The dinner>?was higlily complimented
by all as being the best prepared
and most efficiently served of tb?
season. The dinner was cooked by
two experts,, each a specialist In bis
line. Mik<?>Caunts cooked the meats

service was supurb and each guest
W
could, not have received more attention
if he had been seated at the home
table among the home circle of anyone
of the hosts. Plenty of good
things to eat, sparkling cold ice water,
attentive service and an air of welcome
sums up the occasion. After
dinner Dr. George B. Cromer made
one of his characteristic speeches
mail
which was very appropriate auu
fitted for the occasion.
