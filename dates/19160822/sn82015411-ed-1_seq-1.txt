The Kauai Chamber of Com
merce, with exactly fifty present,
held its annual banquet at the Fair
view Hotel in Lihue Saturday even
ing, beginning at 7 o'clock. The
dining hall arrangements, under
the direction of Major Wm. Henry
Rice, were perfect, and the program
as a whole was one of the most en
joyable yet attempted by the Cham
ber. Fred Patterson, the newly elected
president of the Chamber, was toast
master. Mr. W. C. Avery, the retiring
president, whose work was so flat
teringly commended by vote of the
Chamber at the earlier business ses
sion, made a short address in which
he reviewed in on interesting way
the work of the year. Mr. Patter
son followed with a few remarks,
thanking the Chamber for the honor
conferred upon him and promising
his best efforts in behalf of the or
ganization. During the evening numerous
features were put on by the enter
tainment committee. Albert Hor
ner, Jr., and E.W. Garden present
ed a duet, with Harry Vincent as
accompanist, which was much en
joyed; and Mr. K. Roendahl offer
ed a piano selection which was
equally appreciated. Extraordinary
features were a Japanese sword
dance and a geisha dance, enacted
by experts.
Both a Filipino and a Hawaiian
orchestra supplied music.
Being called.upon, Colonel Broad
bent made a statement in regard to
the National Guard, reporting pro
gress and a healthful state of things
in the way of
Kauai.

TEACHERS ADDED
TO ORIGINAL LIST
At the second day's sittjng of the
Commissioners of Education in Ho
nolulu last Tuesday several changes
were made in the list of teachers for
the Kauai schools the coining year.
The first noted is that Miss Ethel
Kaleo is appointed to Koolau in
place of Miss Masae Tanaka. John
Limahai is added to the Anahola
school. Miss Mary Jensen is ap
pointed to Kapahi. Mrs. I ouisa
Wright, Miss Beatrice Scharschand
Miss Rene Bronileigh no longer ap
pear in the list for Kap'aa, while
Misses Helen M. Rolph, Lulu Brown
anil Marjorie Wiggin and Lucy Aki
and Louise P.Sheldon are new
names in the lit there. Misses Helen
and Margaret Moore are added to
Hanamaulu.
The Kauai High School's force
remains the same as in original list, i
In the Lihue school there will be one
other new teacher, Miss .leanette
Seawright. In the Koloa list it is
noted that the names of Miss Mau-
rine Samson and Miss Palmyra Reis
do not appear. Miss Ahnira Mitchell
is added to Kaluheo. The names of
Misses Ing and Ruth L. Johnson do
not appear in the new Eleele list.
Additions to the staff there are Miss

vacancy. Mrs. Lilian Hardy drops

E
Hon. J. II. Coney addressed the
body in regard to the approaching
election, stating that he had decided
to enter the field for the Senate
and asked the support of the mem
bers. He also made the interesting
announcement that Mr. Chas. H.
Wilcox would be a candidate for
the House.
Mr. Wilcox, in response to calls
for a "speech", said that he had
been thinking over the matter of
running for the House of Represen
tatives, but had not fully decided
anil that the announcement was
probably a little premature. How
ever, if the Chamber felt that it
wanted him to enter the race he
would do so.
The latter remark was greeted by
a round of applause that left no
doubt in the minds of anyone as to
how the members of the Chamber
felt in regard to the matter.
Percy Deverill told a good story,
and the meeting took up again the
matter of delegates to the Civic Con
vention, to be held in Hilo Septem
ber 21-25. After discussion it was
decided that members wishing to go
should file their names with the
secretary and they would be proper
ly accreditted by the President in
the proper season.
The banquet itself was commend
ed as being exceptionally fine and
the service was excellent. Everyone
present considered it a huge success
in every respect.
This was the third annual affair
of the Chamber, the first being upon
the retirement of President Rohrig,
the second upon the retirement of
president Putman and this upon
the retirement of President Avery.
A BRIDGE PARTY
Mrs. F. A. Lyman, of Waimea,
entertained on the 18th, with a
most pleasant bridge afternoon,
complimenting Mrs. J, A. Scott.
At the close of the games Mrs.
Guv Rankin held highest score and
was presented with a crystal and
silver vase. The consolation prize
was a silver pepper shaker which
went to Mrs. Truseott.
For the ladies who, did not care
for bridge there was a guessing con
test, for which Mrs. Black won a
silver tray as first honor and Miss
Strayne a brush for consolation.
