"Washington, Aug. 22.—The answer
'.of more than sixty railroad presidents,
j-^ncludlng those of western roads, new
SSl'Iy arrived, to President Wilson's pro
'posed plan for averting the threatened
gj^Btrike was formulated today. Every
^utterance of the railroad heads dig
played opposition to the president's
suggestion. but it waB considered pos
sible a counter proposal acceptable to
Ijhstbe employes would be made on the
I Jtdsis for further negotiations.
A committee had in charge the
framing of a reply and it appeared
'^doubtful that it could be finished. to
"•"jL-day. The employes' committee of 640
-js continued to mark time.
At 10 o'clock this morning the- men
,Jwent into a meeting which was at
*?/"Jtended by leaders of all four brother
hoods. A statement in reply to the
arguments of the .railroad executives

''on the question of -arbitration was be
Irig prepared by the leaders and prob
'ably .will be Issued for publication to
morrow. The brotherhood officials jde
',1 scribed the situation as unchanged.
If! Wilton Still Hopeful.
'V-§':- The railroad executive*, made an
announcement that consideration of
the situation had been turned oyer to
a .committee of eight and that no con
clusibns had been reached.
While the sub-committee -as work
ing the executives, got in .touch with
their boards of directors, In.-dminif
tration circles it waB said ibere was
hope for a settlement.. The exact 'na
ture of the proposal tobe sumhitted

the conclusion- was
dMLWn that it concerned the concession
tifi ?«f- the eight-hour day.
The. brotherhood meeting did noth
ing and adjourned to meet at 3
.o'clock this-, afternoon.
An invitation from Vice President
Marshall to all representatives to 7i it
the senate today was accepted.
As the railroad executives were not
ready for another conference this
morning. President Wilson called the
cabinet to dispose of business which
has accumulated during the confer
ence.
President and Managers Deadlocked.
President Wilson and the unions, on
the one hand, and the railroad execu
tives, on the other, are deadlocked to
night in the railway wage dispute.
Events within the next forty-eight
hours, it is expected, will determine
whether there is to be a general rail
road strike on the 225 transportation
lines of the country.
Roads See Pufflic Support.
The railway officials departed from
the White House yestdhlay afternoon
without expressing any opinions to the
president and after a protracted cota
fcrence among themselves issued a
public statement which while voicing
objections to the terms proposed by
the president does not reject them. The
executives contend in their statemi»it
that public opinion will indorse their
stand on the principle of arbitration
which the president has set aside.
Publio Must Determine.
The railroad managers, no less de
fiant than the president, assert:
"That the railroads should grant, un
der threat of a national strike, a $60,
000,000 wage preferment to a small
minority of their employes, without a
hearing before a public tribunal, is
inconceivable in a democracy like
ours."
"The weight of public opinion," the
managers add, "must determine this
issue. We cannot believe that it is the
judgment of the country that we
should sacrifice the principle of abri
tration in industrial disputes under a
threat to tie up the commerce of the
country."
Believed Read* Will Yield.
The president, it is learned, intends
to bring further pressure to bear upon
the railway. officials within the next
twenty-four hours, and he is confident
that they will capitulate eventually.
Few of the executives deny that the
president can wield his vast power in
a manner to compel them to acquiesce
in his demands or suffer the conse
quences of political enmity in the fu
ture.
It is regarded as provable that the
carriers, after attempting to obtain
easier terms, will yield, after commit
ting the president definitely to an in
crease of freight rates which will re
quire the consumers of the country to
foot the hills for the increase in wages,
estimated by the railroads at $50,000,
000 a year.
Appeals to Patriotism.
In the conference with fifty of the
leading railway presidents of the coun
try
Mr. Wilson did practically all of
the talking. He appealed to the car
riers to accept the union terms from
motives of patriotism and concern for
humanity.
"1 will not allow passion to come ln
^'rto my thought in this ralemn matter,'**
the president said. "We are both act
ing as trustees of great interests. 1
am willing- tp allow this matter to go
1 to the great American jury and let

responsibility of failure will not rest
with me.
"I wish you to consider the conse
queneeb of a failure to agree as affect
ing the people in the cities und coun
trysides.
"The country can not live if the
means ol' keeping alive its vitality ure
Interfered with. The lives und for
tunes of 100,000,000 men, women and
little onts—many of whom may die—
depend upon what may be done in this
room.
"I appeal to you as one American
citizen to another to avert this disas
ter."
Disaster Strike Result.
The president dwelt on the disas
trous effects of a strike upon the coun
try, more especially in a time like the
present, "when every ounce _pf Amer
ican energy and initiative would have
to be mobilized" to meet the extraor
dinary situation that will immediately
emerge from European war.
President Wilson told the railroad
executives that the great war has
taught this country that it can no
longer remain isolated and provincial:
that by reason of its position in inter
national mafters "we must be ready
to play our role as one of the' domi
nant influences in world affairs."
He added that the various business
and economic interests of the United
States, in order to meet the exigencies
of the new world conditions, must be
brought together into a harmonious
whole.
Cabinet Discusses Situation.
While the railroad executives! were
working today on a counter proposal
to President Wilson's plan to avert a
railroad strike, the cabinet went over
the situation fully and confidence was
expressed that In the end the railroad
presidents would accept the plan.
Cabinet members agreed it was not
feasiable to hurry the railroad execu
tives to a decision. The counter pro
posal is expected to be the next step,
but there was no outward Indication
today as to when it will be taken.

Greek Troops Said to Have Engaged
Bulgarians in Vicinity of Seres—Op
erations in Balkan States Foremost
in Interest, Overshadowing For the
Moment Activities on Other Fronts-^
Developments on Macedonian Front.
The offensive in the Balkans is in
full swing with Russian troops ar
riving in Saloniki to fight with the
entente forces, and .Roumania re
ported about ready to enter the war
on the side of the allies.
Landing of Italian troops is con
tinuing and an unofficial dispatch
reports Greek troops engaged with
Bulgarians in the vicinity of Seres.
Athens advices indicate that Rus
sian troops have been in the Bal
kans more than three weeks, the
initial contingents having appar
ently arrived at Saloniki previous
to July 31, the news having been
released by the entente censorship.
It is only about 350 miles in an air
line from Russia to Greece at the
nearest point, but Roumania and
Bulgaria lie between, and to bridge
the distance the Russians were
obliged to travel thousands of miles.
As the Bosphorus is closed by the
Turks they were deprived of the
short route.
Today's dispatches regarding de
velopments on the Macedonian
front indicate the engagement is
becoming general., Serbian troops
'are reported to halve captured two
forts, while on the western end of
the line the Bulgarians claim not
able advances.
For a moment at least, opera
tions on the eastern' and western
fronts are overshadowed by those
in the Balkans. The entente offen-,
sive, however, is proceedin
terruptedly .pn both these I frontsj
The French and British today botn
claim' progress on the Somma frcn£
Paris. Aug. 22.—The Italian contin
gent of troops landing at Saloniki is of
really important proportions, according
to information here. In addition the
Temps, in reviewing the military situa
tion today, alludes to the presence of
Russian troops along the Vedar river,
which if confirmed, would make five al
lied contingents engaged in the entente
campaign in the Balkans.
The announcement of the landing of
Italians at Saloniki is regarded here as
deeply significant. Indicating an im
portant reinforcement of the already
large army of allies, composed mainly
of British, French and Serbian troops.
The participation of the Italians in
the Balkan campaign also is considered
another evidence of the international
spirit prevailing among the allies and is
compared to the sending of the Russian
contingents to France. By this move
ment the allies are distributing their
effectives far beyond their own borders.
The fighting on the Saloniki front is
becoming more general, saya a Havas
dispatch mailed yesterday from Salo
niki. In the Doiran section Serbian
troops have captured two forts..
-The heaviest fighting is on the frotit
northeast of Saloniki on the Struma^
river. On the western end of the line
hostilities arc confined for the most part
to artillery.
Greeks Engaged With Bulgsrs.
London, Aug. 22.—Greek troops have
been fighting the Bulgarians near Seres,
since Sunday morning, says an Athens
di .patch to the Exchange Telegraph
Company. The Greek commander at
Seres has called to arms all the reserv
ists in that locality, says the dispatch.
That the fighting Is of a stubborn char
acter is indicated by the fact that a
large number of Greek soldiers have
been killed.
(It was stated in a Paris dispatch
yesterday that the fourth Greek army
corps had fallen back from Seres as
well as from Drama. Seres is an im
portant city of about 30,000 population,
45 miles southeast of Saloniki.)
French Gain On Somme Front.
Paris, Aug. 22.—Progress was made
by the French last night on the Somme
front, north of the river, in the out

French captured trenches near Estrees
and Soyecourt.

that on Aug. 18 the Bulgarian left wing

Washiujctor., Aug
Z'l.—The
National
Guard wnf be retailed on the Mexi
can border until.-it?s4ga ye withdrawn
.Without agalk 'endangering American
lives '.and property.
Seci*fttary Baker so declared-the ad
ministration's policy in answering a
number of letters from many parts of
the country complaining that the state
troops were being held in service after
the emergency for which they were
called out apparently had passed.
Iri' general the .complainants, whose
names were withheld, alleged that bor
der service was entailing loss finan
cially on milHtemen and hardship on
their families. The secretary replied
to all those seeming to merit attention.
By its presence on the border, he
wrote to one, the guard is "winning
bloodless victories daily."
The department appreciates, Mr. Ba
ker said in another letter, the fact that
a call for military service upon militia
organizations must "inevitably present
cases of hardship." He added:
"The emergency, however, which re
quired this call for the militia was one
of a grave character, affecting the
safety and lives of citizens of the
United States—men, women and chil
dren. The presence of the militia on
the Mexican border has restored order
and given a higher degree of safety
and security to the lives of our people
In that troubled country than they
have had for a long time."
Referring to the elaborate and ex
tensive training the militiamen are re
ceiving under supervision of regular
army officers, the secretary expressed
the opinion that it would fit them to
act In time of war or other emergency
as a supporting arm or second line for
the regular army, furnishing an asset
to national preparedness that could
not have been obtained otherwise.
"Clearly, so soon as a restored state
of order on the border justifies it,
these troops will be returned to their
homes," he wrote. "In the meantime,
it is not possible for the department
to say how soon such a situation will
arise, altho the Mexican situation Is
one of increasing hopefulness."
In another letter he called attention
to steps taken to relieve guardsmen
where there Is unusual hardship re
sulting from their beinsr called Into the
service. He explained the National
Guard was maintained for Just such
exigencies as that which now exists
on the border, and that It had cost the
government many millions to prepare
and keep It ready for such emergen
cies.

Roumanian Army Already Mobil

of Entente Allies—Army of 800,000.
Athens, Aug. 22.—A brigade of Rus
sian troops has arrived at Saloniki to
join in the fighting in the Balkans.
The arrival of the Russians has
created a profound Impression here.
Even the royaliSts, who had Insistently
opposed partincipation in the war by
Greece on the side of the entente,
seemed almost stunned by the news
that Russian troops had arrived to
take part in the campaign, which
under other conditions might have
been taken by the Greek ariny.
The general feeling here is that the
bringing of Russian troops has dis
pelled definitely the dream of a great
er Greece, which was conceived a
yeao and a half ago by the then Pre
mier Venizelos, who carried Greece
well on the way toward entrance in
the war with the entente allies.
Effect on Politics.
It is Regarded as possible that the
presence* of Russian forces in Mace
donia will effect a change in the atti
tude of Bulgaria.
In some quarters irrtation is dis
played at the recent foreign policy of
the Greek government, which fs said
to have overlooked the interests of
this nation.
After a conference of the British.
French, Serbian and Russian com
manders at Saloniki today it was de
cided that the newly arrived Russian
forces should take up positions with
the Serbian troops on the southern
frontier. The Serbo-Russian force
was placed under a combined staff of
which Crowa Prince Alexander of
Serbia is the nominal commander.
ROUMANIANS MOBILIZING.
A'ntttH-jr Balkan Nation Prepared to
Enter Gr^at CenSis*..
Berliji, Aug, 21, via London. Aug 22.
—The"'r8udapeet Ass Est, which Is
usually weil informed on tho Rouman
ian situation, today prints a dispattft
from its Bucharest correspondent say
ing the agitation for war which in the
last few days has been at fever heat,
has suddenly cooled down. It is stat
ed that possibly the end of mobili
zation is responsible for tho change If
not the serWUs words uttered In the
Hungarian parliament.
This Is the first hint of a Roumanian
mobilization that has been permitted
to pass the allied censorship. Almost
nothing on the Roumanian situation
from the entente view point has come
thru since the Balkin situation in Its
present phase reached a critical
stage.
The Bucharest dispatch adds that
there Is no doubt that Premier Bra
tiano has reached an understanding
with the entente so that negotiations
are unnecessary now for actual par
ticipation :n the war. Meanwhile the
semiofficial Roumanian press is sav
agely attacking the conservative or
gan which undertook to discuss mobi
lization and related measures.
More ammunition from France and
Russia. Is asserted to le arriving.
The white, heat of discussion in
Bucharest is now declared to be sub
siding despite the alleged Imminence
of the final step. This is asserted to
be due to the failure of the Russians
to keep up their recent successes and
the proximity of Field Marshal von
Hindenburg to the Roumanian border.
Army Well Conditioned.
Paris. Aug. 22.—All the morning
newspapers comment on the possi
bility of Roumania joining in the war.
The meetings that are in progress In
Bucharest are taken to mean that all
the various departments In the situa
tion are being considered and It Is In
dicated that the decisive moment for
Roumanian action has arrived.
The recent operations of Bulgarian
troops In the far east are believed to
be the result of an effort to hurry a
Roumanian decision. The statement
is made that the number of Rouman
ian troops that can be mobilized ex
ceeds 800,000 and that the army is In
the best of conditio* after long prep
aration.

Washington, Aug. K.—President Wil
son let it be known today that he would
veto tho immigration hill if it came be
fore him again with the literacy test,
and with that the senate defeated Use
motion to take up the measure.
The president's announcement whleh
settled the question arrived just when
the democrats were continuing their
party row over the action of the nine
revolting democrats, who refused to bo
bound by the caucus, which decided
let the measure go over, and the lead
ers of the revolt were making caustlo
replies to the reproaches of Senator
Stone.
This was a critical day in determin
ing the administration's legislative and
adjournment program. Ten Insurgent
senate democrats, voting with republi
cans, threatened to cause Immedlato
action on the Immigration bill, which a
democratic caucus has agreed to put
over until December. If the attempt
had been successful It would have seri
ously disarranged plans for early ad
journment.
Revolt Unexpected,
The unexpected democratie revolt In
the senate yesterday resulted In the
immigration bill being taken up, in de
fiance of the democratic caucus, and
opened the way for efforts to displace
the revenue bill as unfinished business,
an action which might indefinitely pro
long the session of congress.
Ten democratlo senators voted with
the solid republican minority to take
up the Immigration bill, upon a motion
by Senator Smith of South Carolina,
chairman of the immigration commit
tee. They were Ashurst, Beokham*
Chamberlain, Culberson, Hardwtak,
Lane, Myers, Overman, (Smith of South
Carolina, and Vardaman.

clslon of the democratic caucus to post

til December.
"It turns over to the republican ml

Stone said. "I for one would rather be
In the position of standing with tho
democrats who remained faithful to
the party action than to cross the aisle
and Join hands with the republican mi
nority."
Senators' Ire Aroused.
Senator Stone's words aroused the Ire
of Senators Hardwlck and Smith of
•South Carolina.
"I promised my constituents that I
would do all in my power to secure the
passage of the immigration bill." said
Senator Hnrdwlek, "and 1 propose to
stand by that promise. My constitu
ent is grouter than the democratlo
caucus." Senator Smith Insisted that
the Immigration bill never had been a
partisan issue.
"In view of some of the revelations
that have come In this country since
the beginning of the European war," he
said, "I should think even the oppo
nents of the Immigration bill would be
converted. We should shut our doors
until we can Americanize the crowd we
now have."
Army Appropriation Bill Repassed.
Without the revised articles of war,
to portions uf which President Wilson
and the war department objected, the
house today repassed the army appro
priation bill. The senate Is expected
to insert an acceptable revision and
the house Is expeoted later to ac
cept it.
President Wilson vetoed the bill be
cause of the revision.
Vetoes Lands Bill.
President Wilson today vetoed a
bill to allow cities and tnwnshlps to
buy public lands, including forest
lands in their vicinity, for parks,
cemeteries and sewerage. The presi
dent vetoed the hill on the ground that
the national forests should not be
utilized in that way."
