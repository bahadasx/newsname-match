WEBSTEB CITY
ALE. THE TIME,
ESTABLISHED IN 1857.
Lies Unconscious for Some
Time.
N. F. Christenson, a former resi
dent of this city now residing on a
farm near Fertile, a little town in
Worth county, was the victim Sat
urday of an accident while riding
on horseback through a field on liis
farm in which workmen were blast
ing out stones. Mr. Christenson's
horse stumbled into a declivity
which had been filled with under
brush and stumps, throwing the rid
er to the ground. Th^ victim struck
on his head, cutting a gash which
necessitated the taking of five stitch
,es.
WELKIN RINGS WITH
SHOUTS OF BOYS
Kendall Young Park is the Scene of
a Big Time—Boys Spent
Entire Night.
The boys of Webster City had one
of the biggest times of their lives
at Kendall Young Park Friday night.
Ample arrangements had been made
for the entertainment of the boys
and every thing moved off as if by
clock work. The boys all say the en
tire affair was a signal success in
every respect.
The firBt squad and the cooks left
•'for the park a little after five
^o'clock. Prank Worsing was the
ehef of the evening, and had
charge of the culinary department
and those who were there say he is
surely some artist in this line. The
sports of the evening were also un
der the direction of Mr. Worsing.
About seven o'clock the rest of the
crowd began to gather and by 7:30
the boys, great and small, went
swimming. This was enjoyfed until
'about 8:30 when the boys gathered
around the ramp fire to listen to the
thrilling stories of Indian life told by
the Rev. J. O. Staples. The boys were
deeply interested in these stories, and
when at one time a real ghost
was seen to appear from the woods,
some of the smaller boys were ob
served to look around for some
grown person to whom they might
go for safety. The eats, to which
the boys had been looking forward
with anticipation, were served at
D: 30. The quality and quantity or
the eats can be ascertained by the
remark of one of the boys, "We sure
ly did get filled up in great shape."
The boyB were also treated liberally
to stick sugar candy through the
courtesy of Rev. Staples. It is need
less to state that this made a decid
ed hit with the boys. By this time
it was thought it was time to retire
for the night. A big blaze was made
by rolling huge logs in the fire. The
smaller boys were placed under shel
ter and the rest slept out in the
open. At an early hour next morning
the boys returned to their homes,
feeling it was one of the most en
joyable affairs it had ever been their
pleasure to experience. Before leav
ing the camp next morning, Rev.
Staples served some biscuits, "to give
them something to get back to town
on," as he expressed it.
Those who had the matter in
charge feel that particular mention
should be made of the especial inter
est manifested by Rev. Staples. All
during the night, when the rest
were slumbering, he remained awake
to keep up the fire, and to see that
the boys would not want for any
attention. He saw to it that none
were uncovered and thus exposed to
the damp air of the night. His watch
ful care is indeed appreciated by all
who were present.
A Fine Garage.
The erection of L. A. McMurray's
new private garage will be started
Monday morning, the work being in
charge of L. C. Rasmussen. When
I completed the garage will be one of
I the most modern am} complete in
this part of the country. It is un
derstood it is to be erected at a cost
of $1,200 and will have room for
two earn.

EDUCATION COSTS
COUNTY BIG SUM
Annual Report of County Superin­
tendent Shows Schools Cost
Over $150,000.
*/,
...
Did you know that it costs mnrt
than $150,000 to maintain the
schools of Hamilton county for one
year? This information is brought
out in the report which is made to
the State Department of Public In
struction by County Superintendent
E. F. Snow.
The report contains much infor
mation regarding the Schools of this
county and a Freeman-Tribune re
porter took the time to glean just a
few of the many Interesting facts
contained therein. The teachers of
this county received last year the
sum of $101,646.79. That looks like
it is a large sum of money and the
teachers of this county are certain
ly getting rich fast. But If you take
the number of teachers employed in
thei county, which is 264, and com
pute the average amount paid to
each teacher, you will find that the
amount is not really so large after
all. The report shows that of the
264 teachers employed in Hamilton
county that 180 of them are in the
country and 84 of them are employ
ed In town schools. The women
teachers outnumber the men teach
ers, there being 236 ladies in the
pedagogical profession while there
are but 28 men who devote their
time and energy to the development
of the young inlnd. The towns of
the county have an enrollment of
2,523 pupils and the rural schools
have 2302, making a total of 4,825
pupils in school the past year in this
county.
A Gasoline Launch.
A spiall gasoline launch, owned ly
Ralph and Clyde Hall, was launched
upon Boone river Friday north of
the R. G. Clark dam and works like
charm. Since Mr. Clark raised
the height of his dam, the river
above the dam has enlarged itself to
quite respectable proportions and it
is expected that more than one boat
will be placed in the stream before
many months. The water in the
river has increased in depth by
about thirty inches above the dam,
backing up for nearly a mlie. The
dam Is just below the Des Moines
street bridge and has greatly improv
ed the appearance of the river in
that vicinity.
New Cases.
L. A. Lehnhard is having forty
feet of wall cases for the display of
shirts placed in his clothing store.
By the installation of these cases it
will make it much easier in hand
ling shirts, and customers can have
also a better idea of the line carried
than when the shirts are kept in
boxes*

CHARLES E. HUGHES
LIFE MOTOR MEANS
OF SAVING LIFE
Harvey Bosworth is Overcome by
Gas and is Saved by Use of
Lung Device.
Ilarvcy W. BoswortH," one of the
well known pioneer residents of
Hamilton county, who resides on
west Second street, owes his life to
the prompt use of the life motor.
Mr. Bosworth went into the bath
room Saturday afternoon about four
o'clock to take a bath. He turned
on tho gas, but evidently neglected
to light it. He was in a short time
overcome by the fumes which con
stantly flowed from the gas jet, and
in trying to get from the bath room
fell against the door. The family
discovered his condition and sent for
Dr. Drake, who hurried to the Bos
worth residence. When the doctor
arrived at the house, Mr. Bosworth
was purple in the face and no time
was lost in the application of the
lung motor. In about eight minutes
lie li:ul regained consciousness. He is
able to be up and aroupd today and
is apparently none the worse off for
his experience.
Dr. Drake was informed what the
trouble was when summoned to the
Bosworth home and he stopped at
the tire station and took the life mo
tor, which the citizens of this city
purchased some time ago, with him.
This device was purchased for emer
gency rases just like this and this
one case shows the wisdom of the
purchase. Mr. Bosworth is certain
ly to be conKratulated upon his es
cape from inhaling an over dose of
gas.
Collision on East Bank Street.
An accident occurred upon the
hill enst of the Bank street bridge
Saturday night but who were in the
collision it is impossible to find out.
A badly damaged buggy at the side
of the road east of the bridge is evi
dence of the smashup. The Neighbors
in that vicinity say an auto going
down the hill collided with the
buggy. It is reported that a gentle
man by the. name of Blue was driv
ing the car but who the occupant of
the buggy was and how1 the collision
happened is not known.
Mother Dead.
Word lias been received by rela
tives in this city of the death of Mrs.
Kinma Marvel at Waynesville, 111.,
Sunday afternoon at. 3 o'clock. Mrs.
Marvel was the mother of C. W.
Marvel of this city and her son was
on his way to her bedside when the
final summons came. The deceased
had suffered a long and serious ill
ness and the final call came as a
blessed relief from mortal pain.
Earl Spiker of Kamrar, an eleven
year old boy, underwent an opera
tion at Mercy hospital this morning
for the removal of tonsils.

WEBSTER CITY, IOWA, TUESDAY, AUGUST 22, 1916.
IN NEW QUARTERS
1 THIS EVENIN6
Orpheum Theatre to Move at Once—
New Room not Quite Ready
for Occupancy.
The Orpheum theatre will move
into its new quarters today in
the building being constructed by E.
H. Martin. The theatre room Is not
yet fully ready for occupancy, but in
view of the fact that the Woolworth
company is anxious to move into the
building now occupied by the Orphe
um and as it will need considerable
fixing, matters are being hurried a
little. All of the equipment for the
new theatre is not here yet. Some
of the old seats and other utilities
will have to be used temporarily.
The new Orpheum will be one' of the
finest theatres in this part of the
state and Manager Hyatt will havfe
more room to take care of his in

A NEAR DROWNING
IN BOONE RIVER
-.v'r
Mrs. John Munn, Residing in the
Northwest Part of Town,
Rescued with Difficulty.
Mrs. John Munn, residing in the
northwestern part of town, had a
narrow escape from drowning in
Boone river at Nokomis park Sunday
evening. Mrs. Munn is a good swim
mer, but became excited when in
deep water and called for help. At
first it was thought by spectators
that Mrs!' Mtfliii w4s only joking, but
after she had gone down once,
Charles Rutledge, residing upon the
Blue place three miles east of the
city, who was in swimming, went to
her aid. She grabbed him and the
two went down together. Glen
Martin, who is here visiting from
Phoenix, Arizona, was in the water
at the time and went to the rescue,
and he and Mr. Rutledge brought
Mrs. Munn safely to the shore. It
was a very fortunate termination of
what might have been a fatal acci
dent.
It is said that there has been more
or less joking about drowning by
swimmers at the park. This is some
thing that should never be indulged
in. Spectators and swimmers should
know that when a person calls for
help they are in earnest and need as
sistance.
RAISE MAKES ALL
STOCUS GOATS
Sweeping Change in Assessed Valua­
tion by Executive Council
Raises Taxes.
According to a new ruling mads
by the executive council of the state
all live stock, with the exception of
goats, is made the goat. That is to
say, the assessed valuation of live
stock, with the exception of goats,
has been raised. In many cases the
raise is quite large, ranging all the
way from 10 to S7 per cent. If this
change had been made in the early
part of the year, the county auditor
ould have so instructed the asses
sors of the different townships, and
the whole thing would have -been
comparatively easy, with the excep
tion of explaining It to the stock
owners. As it is, the assessors work
has been completed and it is now
necessary for the auditor to go over
all of the books and make the
changes as ordered by the executive
council. "There is a great deal of
stock In this county," said Auditor
Peterson this afternoon, "and you
tan believe me when I say that this
new order of the council involves a
great amount of additional work."
No particular reason is assigned by
the council for the change in the
rate.
Claude Boyd is now employed as
clerk in the Frank B. Smith drug
store.
.. ». .. ..\.W
former Resident Passes Away—Vic­
tim of Heart Trouble—Was

fering with heart trouble since the
2nd of August, passed away at about
midnight Saturday night.
Anna Maria Guinan was born in
Holland Landing, Ontario, Aug. 2f
1868, and was 4 8 years old when she
passed away. She is a daughter of
the late Mr. and Mrs. Charles Gui
nan who came to Hamilton county in
1880, settling on a farm eight miles
northeast of this city. The father
passed away some fifteen years ago
and the mother followed some five
years later. When the home was
broken up about ten years ago Miss
Guinan. went to l^aurens and em
barked in the millinery business and
hkd made that town her home ever
since.
For some time the deceased had
been ailing with heart trouble and
she gradually became worse until it
was found necessary to bring her to
the hospital in this city. Her sis
ter, Miss Margaret Guinan of Spo
kane, Wash., was at her bedside
when she passed away. Other broth
ers and sisters left to mourn her
death are Mabel, Seattle, Wash.

Fistic Encounter.
Two employes of the Vienna cafe
resorted to a fistic encounter Satur
day evening during the supper hour
as a result of a misunderstanding of
duties.
The waiter, who had been off duty
during the afternoou, returned just
before tho evening rush to find fresh
coffee had not been prepared. He
took his fellow worker to task with
the result that the latter received a
severe pummelling. The fight was
decidedly one-sided, owing to the su
perior size and weight of the one
participant. It was witnessed by be
tween twenty-five and thirty people.
Even in ail age of vaunted civili
zation, with its courts, boards of ar
bitration and world court, the prim
itive element of man breaks forth
and reverts to the epoch when might
was right.

DEATH SUMMONS
MISS ANNA GUINAN
AGAINST Ml ORDER
E
Merchants, of Iowa do not Like the
Idea of Advertising the
Big Chicago Firm.
Fort Dodge, Aug. 12.-—A petition
has been signed by the retail merch
ants of the city protesting against
the exhibition which Sears, Roebuck
and Co. of Chicago are planning for
the state fair, to be held in Des
Moines. Similar petitions are being
circulated in all
vthe
1
towns of Iowa.
The argument against allowing the
exhibit is based on the fact that the
mail order house pays no taxes in
Totfa and does nothing for the state.
The committee in charge of the dis
tribution of booths at the fair con
tends that the exhibitions at the fair
are state wide, and have sent circu
lar letters to all of the local merch
ants stating their case. The hard
ware and furniture dealers associa
tion are taking up the matter and
are doing their best to prevent the
exhibit.
Death of Infant Son.
Air. and Mrs. A. P. Miller of

by Automobile Driven by Geo.
'•v'
Christenson.
Two hogs were killed outright
and five others so badly Injured they
had to be killed, as the result of be
ing struck by an automobile east of
town early Saturday morning.
The car was driven by George
Christenson. He was driving about
daylight, according to the report as
given to the Freeman-Tribune, and
came upon a bunch of hogs which
were being driven to town by Henry
Reinhardt. In some way, before the
hogs could get out of the way, or
Mr. Christeson could avoid them, he
ran into the herd as recorded above.
The car was not injured by the acci
dent.

Light Sprinkling is Worse Than

is the method he advises. Turn on!
the water and let it soak up a part^'
of the lawn for half an hour. Tliem^i£
move it across the lawn so that flnj

ough soaking. This should be don&lt|
at night and it may take several
nights io get over all of the lawn.
Many of the lawns In Webster
City are of a bronze color and it
would take more water to revive
them than the average owner care»5
to pay for.
