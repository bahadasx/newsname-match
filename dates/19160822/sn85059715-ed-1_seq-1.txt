PARIS, yVur. 22.?The lighting on

general, says a despatch filed Monday
at Saloniki. In the Doinm section
Serbian troops have captured
Ports Kaimakadar and Cucurlu.
The heaviest fighting is on the

for the most part to artillery,

U have been fighting the Bulgarians in
the vicinity of Ceres since Sunday
morning, says an Athens despatch.

That the lighting Is of a stubborn
character is indicated by the fact
that a large number of Greek soldiers
have been killed.
RUSSIAN TROOPS AT

, i
(BY ASSOCIATED PRESS)
ATHENS, July 31.? (Delayed by
censor)?An initial brigade of Russian
troops has arrived at Saloniki to
join the Entente Allies in the lighting
In the Balkans.
The arrival of the Russians has
created a profound impression here.
Even the Royalists, who have consistently
opposed participation in the
war by Greece on the side of the Entente
Allies, seemed almost stunned
by the news that Russian troops had
arrived to take part in the campaign
which under other conditions might
have been taken by the Greek army.
The general feeling here is that the
bringing in of Russian troops has dispelled
definitely the dream of a
greater Greece, which was conceived
a year and a half ago by the then
Premier Ventzelos, who carried
Greece well on the wdy towards entrance
in the war with the Entente
Allies.
n is regarded as possible that the
presence of Russian forces In .MaceV
donia will effect a change in the
I attitude of Bulgaria.
Mj In some quarters Irritation is displayed
at the recent foreign policy
of the Greek government, which is
said to have overlooked the Interests
H of the nation.
MM After a conference of the British,
Krench, Russian and Serbian commanders
at Saloniki today it was de
cided that the newly arrived RusH
sian forces would take up positions
with the Serbian troops on the south
ern frontier of Serbia.
The Serbo-Iiussian force was
placed under a combined slaff, of
which Crown Prince Alexander of
Serbia is the nominal commander.
M The Russian general Erlederictfz is in
actual command.

I TRICK SCHEME
I
Of the Democratic Officeholdi
ers and Politicians to Get
Votes in the State.
WASHINGTON,,MI Aug."*"^ 2.?The
grand jury'investigation of alleged
l'rauds committed at the June pri:
mary in .McDowell and Mingo coun!
ties was started at Bltiefleld today.
While the department of justice
sanctions the investigation, and has'
designated D. E. French to assist
District Attorney W. G. Barnhart
with it, it is the understanding In
official circles here that Senator Chil'
ton Is the originator, and if that be
ithe case, then it appears to the oh
servers here that it Is to be anything
else except an impartial investigation
to enforce exact justice on any wrong
doers who may be found, it matters!
not whether they broke the laws in
behalf of Democratic or Republican
candidates.
The main purpose it Is believed, is J
to trump up charges against Republicans,
indict some of them if possi-;
ble. and let them remain in the
j shadow of suspicion until after elec- i
| tion, as no trial Is expected or de-.
sired prior to that day. The Idea
seems to be to do something to embarrass
the Republican campaign,!
hoping thereby to gain a few votes
! from that party for the Democratic
candidates.
Privately It la whispered Senator I
Chillon sets high hopes on the effect'
of this investigation and the results!
1 anticipated from it.

Idaho Senator Will Open Campaign
at Morgantown and
^ Wheeling Soon.
' riCIAL TO TMK TKOKQRAM) J
WASHINGTON, August 22?The
first hig gun of the Hepuhlican compaign
in West Virginia will be no less
a personage than Senator William E. I
Borah, of Idaho. Congressman Sutherland
has arranged for hint to visit ,
Morgantown on September 18 and de- ,
liver a speech there In the evening of
that day, and Wheeling the following
day, speaking in that city in the even- .
ing. This will be the only visit that
Senator Borah will make to West Vlr- ,
ginla during the campaign, There is '
a great demand for him from every (
-Republican Slate committee wiiu u? |
the Mason and Dixon line, and the na- j
tional committee is hard at It arranging
an itinerary for him which will ,
take in practically every slate where
the Republicans arc waging a hard
campaign. Under the circumstances,
Congressman Sutherland declares that
West Virginia Republicans should feel ,
elated that such a popular orator and
eminent statesman as Senator Borah ,
is conceded universally to be lias been .
secured to Arc the opening gun for the
party in West Virginia.
An effort is to be made to make the
Wheeling meeting the formal opening
of the West Virginia campaign, notwithstanding
that Senator Borah will
speak In Morgantown on the preceding
day. He goes to Morgantown principally
because he desired lo make a
speech In the district represented by
Col. George M. Bowers. There Is a ,
bond of friendship between the two
which developed when Senator Borah
first came to Washington and Col.
Bowers was United States fish commissioner.
