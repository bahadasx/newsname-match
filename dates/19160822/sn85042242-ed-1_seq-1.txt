Fierce Fighting Near Stokhod
Germans Are Repulsed by
British.
London, Aug. 21.—The great offen­
sive opened by the Allies Sunday on
the Saloniki front is developing, but
no decisive action has been fought.
The British and French advancing on
the right have crossed the Struma,
pushing northeastward toward the
Bulgarian frontier. At the same time
the Serbians,. who }i$,vji opened a
drive for Monaster, report the capture
of Bulgarian first line trenches. On
the extreme left, however, immediate­
ly south of Monastir, they have suf­
fered a reverse and have evacuated
the Greek town of Banaca.
In the center at the mouth of the
great valley of the Vardar, the main
highway through Serbia, violent ac­
tion is in progress. It was down this
valley that the Teuton-Bulgarian forc­
es made their advance and, according
to military experts, its possession is
vital to whoever holds Serbia.
Italians at Saloniki.
Reports from Saloniki say that Ital­
ian troops have landed there and will
join in the general offensive. This, if
corroborated, 'means that Italy has fin­
ally deqidcfd formally to declare war
on Germany, as the Germans are ad­
mittedly, directing the Bulgarian cam­
paign. At certain, ppints on the front,
Berlin reports that Bulgarians on the
offensive, but London and Paris inter­
pret this as a move for political pur­
poses and not as a serlpus attack
against Saloniki. A desire to affect
public opinion in Roumania and to In­
fluence the approaching Greek elec­
tions is the motive behind Bulgaria's
aggressive action, in the opinion of
the Aflted/papitals.

Physicians Discuss Plan for Fight
Against Spread of Infantile
Paralysis.
Chicago, Aug. 21.—A new method of
fighting infantile paralysis through
anti-toxin developed from the blood or
a recovered victim of the malady was
discussed tonight at a conference at­
tended by Dr. John D. Robertson, city
superintednent of health, and several
Chicago physicians.
The method, according to Dr. Rob­
ertson, is as yet in its experimental
stages. One man, who had recovered
from the disease, volunteered today to
give blood for the experiment.
Three positive and three suspected
cases of infantile paralysis were add­
ed to the number of victims here to­
day, the largest number of cases that
were reported here for weeks.

Horrified by Death-House Tra­

Exeontion.
By KENNETH W. PAYNE.
Rochester, NV Y., Aug. 21.—Saved
from death in the electric chair eight
times in succession iby last-minute re­
prieves!
This is,-the hair-raising history of
Charles Stielow, farm hand, said to be
a half-wit, who lies in the death house
at Sing 'Sing prison.
•It has just been revealed to the
writer that a little 'blonde convict in
Sing Sing deserves all credit for a
tip which resulted in Stielow's last
stay of execution.
Stielow was convicted in Orleans
county, N. Y., on a charge of murder­
ing a farmer, Charles Phelps, and his
housekeeper,
!Margaret
'Wolcott. He
has been brought face to face with
death eight times, suffering fearful
ordeals which might have driven
some men insane!
In Judge Adolph Rodenbeck's court
here an appeal for a new trial will
soon be heard. In the meantime the
thrilling story of how iStielow's wife
and children have had their loved one
saved for them is attracting nation­
wide attention.
Misha ApplebaUm, leader of the Hu­
manitarian Cult, today .told me the
first concise and connected story of
this many-reeled thriller.
"The body of Margaret Wolcott, in
a nightgown, was found by Stielow on
his doorstep," said Appelbaum. "Run­
ning to Farmer Phelps' house, Stie­
low found Phelps on the floor, dying.
Rewards of |6,O0O were offered and
(Detective George Newton reported he
had obtained a confession from Stie­
low, who was found guilty and sen­
tenced.
"But a little blonde youngster, who
is a convict in Sing ISinp—I cannot
give his name—discovered informa­
tion he said would prove Stielow in­
nocent. Stricken with horror at the
tragedy of the man with a child's
mind who was cooped up near him in
the death house, the convict got word
to a lawyer of the 'Mutual Welfare
league, the Sing Sing convicts' soci­
ety.
"Inez Millholland Boissevain and
IMrs. Grace Humlston, the woman
lawyer, who has already save two
persons from the chair, became in­
terested. Seven times, as the hour
for execution neared, Stielow was giv­
en reprieves, to allow counsel to gath­
er evidence for a new trial. Gov.
Whitman, himself, issued five consec­
utive reprieves.
"But the motion for a new trial was
'finally refused and execution set for
sunrise on a Saturday morning.
"Two days before Stielow was to
die David White, his counsel, and
myself, with (Mrs. Stielow and the
Stielow children rushed to Gov. Whit­
man's office to ask another reprieve.
The governor told us to wait.
"Mrs. Stielow and the children
went back to the prison to wait for
the body of their loved one to :be
turned over to them, went to New
York. I decided to call up all the
judges in the city.
"By pure chance my eye fell on the
name of Justice Charles L. Guy of
the supreme court, and at 4:45 in the
morning, only a few hours ibefore the

CIT( SCHOOLS
TO BE
Supt. Martin Makes Important
Announcements in Regard to
Local Schools.
TfcACHERS LISTED
FOR COMING YEAR
Superintendent J. M. Martin of the
Bismarck schools yesterday made sev­
eral announcements relative to the
opening of the schools of the city that
will be interesting to all. The Capital
Gity schools will open for the 1916-17
school year Monday, September 4.
(High school students not previously
registering must do so Monday morn­
ing between the hours of 9 and 11:30.
Monday being a legal holiday the reg­
ular school sessions will not com­
mence until Tuesday, September 5.
A general teachers' meeting, at
which all teachers are expected to be
present, will take place Monday after­
noon, September 4, at 2:30 o'clock.
The grade pupils will be enrolled
Tuesday morning.
The .grade arrangement will be as
follows: North Ward school, grades
1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 Will school, grades
1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4 and 5. Owing to the
congestion in the high school, the
most expensive part of our school
system, the grades which have here­
tofore been housed in the high school
biulding will be taken care of else­
where in the city until permanent
quarters are secured. The building
and grounds committee of the board
of education are in charge of the mat­
ter of a location for the grades which
were in the high school last year and
a fourth grade which has been added
to relieve crowded conditions now ex­
isting. These outside grades will be
grades 4, 5, 6, 6.
It is hoped that the division of the
city for attendance may be somewhat
as last year, and doubtless will be in
the first three grades, but above that
grade there will of necessity be some
irregularity, owing to the conditions
mentioned above. The superintendent
of schools is hopeful that the patrons
will be patient and give an opportun­
ity for those in charge to adjust the
attendance, which will be attended to
as carefully and correctly as possible.
The assignment of teachers appears
elsewhere.
Years of experience have taught us
that the best results are obtained by
those who enter on the opening day
and continue regular and punctual in
attendance until the close of the
school year. Teachers are instructed
to receive all pupils according to the
standing given them at the close of
the public school year last June. All
pupils not in possession of such cre­
dentials are to enter school through
the office of the superintendent, secur-

SUGAR TARIFF
Republican Nominee Outlines His Militia Will Not Be Withdrawn
Views on Many Important
Issues.
OPPOSED TO REMOVAL
OF TAX ON SUGAR
(Candidate fotr President Speaks
of Need of "Industrial Co
operation."
San Diego, Cal., Aug. 21.—Charles
E. Hughes, addressing, an audience on
the Expositibp grounds here today,
outlined his views on the protective
tariff, dominant Americanism, nation­
al unity and preparf daess.
'Mr. 'Hughes [cited the removal of
the tariff on ^gar the Underwood
act, as an illustration of a policy to
which he was opposed.
''Why shovild there have been an
attempt to cripple and destroy the su­
gar.* industry in this country?" he
asked. "Was there any reason for
it? Was there any statesmanship in
it? Was it called for by the coun­
try? No.
"Our friends discovered their mis­
take after awhile, but we desire to
be represented by those who have
foresight and not simply hindsight."
"America must be sound and honest
in its life, but it must be business­
like, it must be direct, it must be pa­
triotic, with America first and Amer­
ica efficient.
"My friends of California, do cct
misunderstand me.. There is not go­
ing to be any private grip on any pub­
lic privilege for any corporate inter­
est or combination of interests, at
the expense of the toterests of the
people of the UnitedfjStates if I can
prevent it."
Need of "Industrial^Co-operation."
'Mr. Hughes spoke jpf the need of
"industrial co-operatioh."
"The man who looks, upon his labor­
ers simply as mere eey'onic units has
nofc caitghfc the v&lci/ flt tlfli twmttetfc
century," he said.
"What we need in tlii3 country
not demagoguery nor standpatism,
but the desire to benefit our fellow
man by working together to that end,
according to the spirit of our institu­
tion."
"We do not wish to wait," (Mr.
Hughes continued, "until an import­
ant industry is crippled and in danger
of destruction.
"The good people of Louisiana pro­
tested in vain. They went to their
own administration in vain. They
presented facts, only to^ be disregard­
ed.
"Now I protest against any action
aimed at the crippling of American
enterprise, Why should American
industries go out of business? In
order that we may buy goods abroad?
That is not sound American policy."
The nominee declared he favored
"the protection of the generations of
the future."
"I believe in preventing children
from being drawn too early into the
hardships of industrial life," he said
Mr. Hughes again assailed the ad­
ministration for its (Mexican policy
and declared for American rights
abroad.
REVOLT OF
RAY PROLONG
Session at Washington May Be
Delayed by Unexpected Move
of Politicians.
Washington, Aug. 21.—An unexpect­
ed Democratic revolt in the senate
today resulted in the immigration bill
being taken up in defiance of the
Democratic caucus and opened the
way for efforts to displace the rev­
enue bill as unfinished business, an
action which might indefinitely pro­
long the session of congress.
The Democratic senators voted
with the solid Republican minority to
take up the immigration bill upon a
motion of Senator Smith of South
Carolina, chairman of the immigra­
tion committee.
Administration leaders said tonight
they have enough votes to defeat the
Smith motion. Even some of the re­
volting Democrats have declared their
intention of voting against it. Should
it prevail the fight over the literacy
provision would upset all adjourn­
ment calculations.
Senator Stone, chairman of the for­
eign relations committee, was partic­
ularly aroused over the action of the
revolters. He charged them with
treachery to the party in overturn­
ing the decision of the Democratic
caucus to postpone action on the im­
migration bill until December.

WINNING "BLOODLESS
VICTORIES" DAILY
Guardsmen Are Receiving Excel
lent Training on the Mexi.
can Front.
Washington, Aug. 21.—The national
guard will be retained on the Mexi­
can border until it can be withdrawn
without again endangering American
lives and property. Secretary Baker
so declared the administration's pol­
icy today in answering a score of let
ters from many parts of the country,
complaining that the state troops
were being held in servipe after the
emergency, fox which tl^.were call­
ed out, apparently had pabs&l.'
Winning "Bloodless Victories."
In general, the complainants, whose
names were withheld, alleged that
border service was entailing a loss
'financially on militiamen and hard­
ships on their families. The secre­
tary l-eplied to all those seeming to
merit attention. By its presence on
the border, he wrote to one, the guard
is "winning bloodless victories daily."
He declared that American residents
along the international line were en­
joying a peace and security that they
could not know without the military
forces to protect them.
"The emergency, however,'' (Mr. Ba­
ker said in another letter, "\yhich re
Quired this call for the uiiUtja, was
one of a grave character, affecting
the safety and lives. of citizens of
the United States—men, women and
children. The presence of the militia
on the Mexican border has restored
order and given a high degree of safe­
ty and security to the lives of our
people in that troubled country than
they have for a long time had. The
militia is, therefore, performing a val
sferviCe. -aM tlie -fact that' this
service is being performed without ac
tive military operations, entailing loss
of life to our soldiers, is a cause of
congratulation and happiness."
Receiving. Excellent Training.
(Referring to the elaborate and ex­
tensive training the'militiamen are
receiving, the secretary expressed the
opinion .that it would fit them to act
in time of war or other emergency as
a supporting arm, or second line for
the regular army.
"Clearly, so soon as a testored
state of order on the 'border justifies
it, these troops will be returned to
their homes," he iwrote. "In the mean­
time, it. is not possible for the de­
partment to say how soon such a sit­
uation will arise, although the Mexi­
can situation is one of increasing
hopefulness."

Commission Finds Lines Paid
Higher Percentage on Value
Than Land.
The state board of equalization yes
terday considered the taxation of rail­
roads.
A report turned in by the state tax
commission showed that all of the
railroads had been assessed at a high­
er percentage of the actual value than
land and that two of the roads had
been assessed from 16 to 17 per cent
more.
Land was assessed last year at 22
per cent of the actual value, while the
railroads were assessed at from 24 to
39 per cent, according to the returns
of the commision.
The men representing the railroads
at the hearing were: A. S. Dudley of
the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul

President Wilson today appealed to each one of the executives of

as significant, when it is remember­

significant feature of the situation
was that only about 40 per cent of

Rail Head Issues Statement.
The railroad heads still insist the
president is asking them to sacrifice
the prnciple of arbitration. Elisha
Lee, charman of the national confer*
ence committee of railroads, issued a
statement tonight, in which he said:
"That the railroads should grant,
under threat of a national strike, a
$50,000,000 wage preferment to
small majority of their emplo'yea with*
out a hearing before a public tribunal,
is Inconceivable in a democracy like
ours. All questions at issue—wages,
hours, cost, operating conditlppt—
submerged by the greater issue: shill
arbitration be abandoned in the settle­
ment of industrial disputes t"
The statement suggests, however,
that the railroads stand ready to tike
whatever action the people ai)d the

trial disputes, under a threat, to tMt
up the commerce of the country.".

Speaks in Intimate Fashion.
The president spoke in more inti*

the previous conferences. He refer­
red to the disastrous effect a strike
would have, and declared so "espe*
cially at this time when every ounce
of energy and initiative has to be

situation which will emerge out of the
European war."

for him to bring about arbitration un­

ter into an argument with the preet
