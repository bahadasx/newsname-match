ENIES JAPAN HAS
Third Secretary of Legation
Attributes Reports of Ag

lntern.it inual News Service:.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 22. "Ger
man propagandists inspired and
spread reports of the acquisition
through secret agents of land for a
naval base on the Atlantic seaboard
of Panama. Such statements are
so utterly ridiculous that the Jap
anese government scarcely feels the
necessity f stamping them as un
truths." Nobutaro Kawi-.mima. third sec
retary of the Japanese embassy, to
day issued this denial on behalf of
his government, of the charges of
Japanese aggression on the isthmus.
When informed that the state de
partment's information concerning
the " land deal" were of such a se
rious character thtt it had felt war
ranted in instituting a searching in
vestigation. Mr. Kawashinia said
that the Japanese gov ernment would
welcome the most thorough inquiry
into this and similar 'manufactur
ed" reports.
Want Facts Di- lo4l.
The Japanese government will
take no othcial recognizance" of the
allegations. Mr. Kaw;ushima said,
un '-ss the matter is brought formal
ly to its attention by the st.t de
partment. The embassy, the diplo
mat said, was eager that the true
tacts oncerning the transaction
might be developed.
"The state department is not de
ceived by malicious stories which
emanated with surprising frequency
since the war began, in an rganized
attempt to create anti-Japanese feel
ing in the Fnited States." comment
ed Mr. Kawashirna.
sH'k Agent status.
At the state department it wa.4
learne! that inquiry may b made
of the Japanes embassy as to the
statu of the silk importer at Ha
vana. Cuba, who is said to have en
gineered the "land deal" involving
tO.l'OO acres, with the aid of orficials
of the Panama government. The al
leged purchaser, although of Span
ish nationality, is said to he the
financial agent f Japanese silk lirms
in Cul-a.
Sec'y of State Lansing reiterated
today that only unothcial" reports
thus far have reached this govern
ment concerning the transaction,
but that they are being carefully

Catholic Women's League
Meeting Rejects Plan to

Int rti itbtn ii New Servb- :
NHW YORK. Aug. Stormy
scenes were precipitated today in
th meeting- of the Cathclic Women's
league when a resolution was moved
to separate the woman's organiza
tion from the American Federation
of Catholic societies. The motion
which was made by the Rev. J. M.
Corrigan of Philadelphia, wa voted
down and the meeting" broke up in
disorder, after the presiding oMieer,
Miss Helen M. Haney. had turned
the chair over to Francis Slattery of
Hilton. only about half of the
women voted, the reconled vote be
ing against the motion and 16 in
favor of it.
Mrs. Martha Moore Avery deliver
ed a scathing attack against woman
suffrage, saying;
"If we should be unfortunate
enough to have a woman suffrage
party in Massac hasetts 1 wot. Id or
ganize the Catholic womm .'gainst
the divone evil which would be sure
to follow"
Mrs. Avery also attacked social
ism, saving it was allied with athe
ism. Rishop P. J. Muldoon of Rock
ford. 111., who addressed the women
upon their otvie obligations, said:
"R not blame things ni the
Protestants. If you do not Join in

Say Cartage Charge
Is Cause of High
Cost of Living
lLternation.il N-.s scribe:
WASHINGTON. Aug. 22. A new
investigation hearing on the indus
trial situation in the Fnited States
is about to bo undertaken by the
bureau f the census. The inqiiiry
will be to determine the cost of cart
age in American cith's and is de
clared by experts to be of the ut
most importanc e in its relation to the
high cost of living and the wages of
labor. ,
Comptroller of the Treasury War
wick, has just handed down a de
cision authorizing the expense in
volved in making the inquiry anil
work will start as soon as Sec'y of
Comerce Redlield giv es formal ' au
thorization. This is expected im
mediately upon Mr. Redtield's re
turn from his vacation.
Experts of the -ensus bureau bo
live that the extr'me retail prices
of commodities in common use are
due largely to the high cost f city
cartage. The city delivery system
is largely believed to be to blame
for the high cost of living. The ex
perts estimate that a greater pr
centage of the cost of goods is
chnrgeahle to city cartatre than to
railroad freight, rates. The investi
gation will go thoroughly into all
phases of the roblern.

Ten Revolting Democrats Join
Minority in Calling Up
Immigration Bill.
International News Serviee :
WASHINGTON, Aug. 22. The
tlemocratie insurgent movement
against the administration legis
lative program was broken dow n
this afternoon. The senate voted
.'!2 to 2:J against sidetracking the
emergency revenue bill to make
way for the immigration bill
containing the literary test.
The vote vvas taken after it
had been learned that Pres't
Wilson had inforno-d callers to
day that he Aould veto the im
migration bill if it came before
him again containing the liter
acv test.
International News Scrvbe:
WASHINGTON". Aug. 22. On the
eve of adjournment, democratic
leaders in the senate "today faced the
worst revolt ol the session. Hvery
political and legislative stratagem
was put into play today by the ad
ministration to thwart the attempt
to ditch the emergency revenue bill
to make way for the immigration
hill.
Leaders insisted today they had
won back nough of the In insurgent
tlemocratie senators to insure suc
cess of the caucus program when
the question is put to a vote this
afternoon. Pleas for party solid
arity to hasten adjournment weie
showered upon recalcitrants in the
efforts to quell the revolt.
If the 10 democratic senators who
voted yesterday with the republi
cans t, take up the immigration
bill, vote the wime way today ther
is no telling when congress will be
able to adjourn. If enough of them
heed the call b;.ck to the democratic
standard, practically all chance ,f
action on the immigration bill at
this session will hav; bten killed.
Pacific coast senators were still
urging (action todav on th- pro
vision regarding Japanese immigra
tion. Another executive session
probably will be h-ld to give free
rein to senators for dis ussion of
this ilelicate subject.
