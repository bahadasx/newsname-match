MADDEN HAD TO MOVE
His Intemperate Expressions Were
Not Relished by the People
of Newberry
. (Gainesville Sun)
News was received from Newberry
Monday afternoon that L. A. Madden,
a Western Union Telegraph lineman,
had been requested by . citizens to
leave town, and that the man, con
cluding that discretion was the better
part of valor, had taken the hint and
gone away.
It is said that Madden had express
ed his approval of the killing of Con
stable Wynne, which unfortunate af
fair has already resulted in the death
of six negroes, and the people were
not prepared to listen to his intem
perate utterances. v
Madden had been arrested several
times by Constable Wynne, hence his
animus toward that officer who died
in the performance of his duty.
The people of Newberry are well
pleased that there will be a special
term of court so that the slayer of
Mr. Wynne will have a speedy trial

KNOTT GAINED VOTES
IN PUTNAM COUNTY
Palatka, Aug. 22. Pursuant to the
peremptory writ of mandamus issued
by the supreme court, the inspectors
and clerk of precinct No. 2, George
town, met here yesterday and re
counted the ballots of the precinct.
The corrected tabulation of the vote
cast in that precinct showed a net
gain of eight votes for Mr. Knott.
This gain in the Georgetown precinct,
together with the remaining precincts
of this, county, gives Mr. Knott a gain
of twenty votes by the recount in this
county. The gain for Mr. Knott in
the Georgetown precinct was due to
the fact that the inspectors did not
correctly tally the second choice votes
cast for the respective candidates for
governor when they made their first
returns.
Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Spencer and
family will leave Ann Arbor, Mich.,
on the 25th for Lakeland. They will
spend a few days in Chicago en route

JACKSONVILLE AS
A COTTON PORT
For a number of years George
Giles & Co., the Ocala cotton buyers,
have insisted that Jacksonville or
Tampa should be made a cotton port
and handle the cotton grown in Flor
ida and near-by Georgia points. The
dream of Giles has materialized. He
was invited to Jacksonville a few days
ago by some of the prominent busi
ness men and shown the muniicpal
docks, warehouses and other facilities
which the city has put in to take care
of cotton and other products. Any of
our citizens visiting Jacksonville
should visit these institutions and see
the powerful compresses, which Giles
says are of the most modern type and
superior to any that he has seen in
Savannah, New Orleans and other
ports that he has visited.
Giles & Co. believe in Florida first
and will therefore do all in their
power to help make Jacksonville a
cotton port.
The Wilson-Mason Co. are the prin
cipal cotton merchants. They have
the most improved facilities for tak
ing care of this business and the indi
cations are 'that they will be reward
ed with a splendid business.

CATTS ISNT CONSISTENT
Editor Star: I was in to hear Sid
ney J. Catts speak Friday night. Mr.
Catts says he is going to bring about
an equalization of taxes, certainly u
very commendable ambition. Mr.
Catts cites the rate at which the rail
roads are assessed, but does not men
tion the many thousands of cattle
thatU
escape taxation in this state. Maybe
Mr. Catts would loue some of his en
thusiastic supporters if he was so
impolitic, for there is one thing that
is sure about Mr. Catts, he is a very
shrewd politician. But to tell you the
truth, I don't think Mr. Catts is con
sistent. I heard him speak before the
primary. His speech reminded me of
a page from the Menace. But what a
difference Friday night! Mr. Catts has
gained an element of voters, now ha
is out after the other. It serves to
be popular with Mr. Catts and his fol
lowers to make puns on his name,
some of them particularly vulgar. He
assures us that the people of Florida
will have no cause to be ashamed of
him four years hence. Don't you think
a good start could be made now by
showing more respect for his pro
f ession, and the high office to which
he aspires, by treating his name with
common decency? As I said, I heard
Mr. Catts speak before the primary
and he reminded be of a page from
the Menace or the Yellow Jacket, but
now he tells us he is complimented
and endorsed by a prominent Roman
Catholic cleric and he seemed to be
proud of it. Now, who i3 being fool
ed. ' Yours truly, ,.

Of Railroad Managers to Pre-

HO DECISION REACHED BUT
MORE
(Associated
Washington, Aug. 22 The railroad
presidents this morning appointed a
committee of eight to consider Presi
dent Wilson's proposals for averting
a strike and make a report to7. the
railroad executives, and meanwhile
got in touch with their boards of
directors. The brotherhood represen
tatives held a meeting, which the lead
ers said" was just to keep the men to
gether. It soon adjourned. The pres
ident called a cabinet meeting to dis
pose of other business. . '
PRESIDENT APPEALED TO THEIR
PATRIOTISM
President Wilson yesterday after
noon appealed to each of the ex
ecutives of the country's principal
railroads on the grounds of patriot
ism to accept his plan for averting
the threatening disaster of a nation
wide strike. - ; 7
The president emphasized the nec
essity for keeping the railroads in
service for , national defense and to
make possible the preparation for
meeting the conditions that will exist
after the European war. .
On leaving the White House the
railroad presidents held a conference
at which sentiment is said to have
been against the president's 'proposal
in its present form.
Hope was expressed, however, that
some 'satisfactory counter proposi
tion might be advanced. The task of
drafting a finaly reply to the presi
dent was turned over to a committee.
ADMINISTRATION IS HOPEFUL -
WThile the utterance of the railroad
executives had shown them opposed to
the president's proposal that they
concede the eight-hour day, adminis
tration circles appared hopeful of a
ettlement today, and from the fact
that the railroad executives communi
cated with their boards of directors,
the conclusion was drawn that their
action concerned the concession for
an eight-hour day.

MENDENHALL MAKING
THE BEST OF IT
The St. Petersburg Independent
says:
MThat J. J. Mendehall, who is per
haps the most notorious prisoner now
serving a term in the state prison
is hard at work and is being shown
no special favors by the prison au
thorities, is the assertion of Gus Bart-
lett, a drummer who arrived here this
morning.
"Mr. Bartlett said that yesterday.
he was at the prison camp at Raiford,
Bradford county, where he saw and
talked with Mendenhall, and found
him in vigorous health. He was en
gaged with several other prisoners, in
filling a large silo with chopped corn.
Mendenhall's job was tamping down
the silage with a heavy maul, which
he handled as if he were quite used to
that kind of labor.
"Mr. Bartlett said that Mendenhall
wore shackles on his ankles, and was
the only prisoner he ' saw there who
was thus manacled. Evidently the
piison authorities are not taking any
chances as to his getting away. Men
denhall talked freely with Mr. Bart
lett and said he was being treated
well, that he could not complain of a
thing, so far as prison life went. He
was taking his punishment philisop-
ically. The hours of labor were riot
onerous. The prisoners began work
early in the morning, but were allow
ed to rest during the hottest part of
the day, resuming their labor along
about the middle of the afternoon."
