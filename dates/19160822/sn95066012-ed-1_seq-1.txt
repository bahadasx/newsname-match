Czar's Army Encountering Strong
Defences About Koveli
SLAVS GAIN ON STOKHOD
Have Broken Through Austrian Lines
and Menace Carpathian
Passes.
Petrograd, Aug. 21. Further ad
vances have been made at some points
along the lino or the lower Stokhod,
where they broke through the Austro
Hungarian defenses last night, while
in the Carpathians they are pressing
vigorously through two of the passes
which load to Hungary.
Following the announcement last
week of advances in the vicinity of
Korosmezo, which is just over the bor
der in Hungary, the War Office today
reported gains in the pass east of this
region, leading south from Kuty. The
capture of Jablonitza and Feresku, on
the Cheremosh Hiver, Which forms the
boundary between Gallcia and the Bu-
kowina. is announced. Jablonitza is
about twenty miles north of the Hun
garlan border.
It is impossible at the present time
to say whether the Russian attack
upon Kovel from the Stokhod region
continues with its original energy, but
the belief seemst o prevail here that
the discovery of a series of strong (Jer
man fortifications protecting Kovel
from the east led the Russian Staff to
base its hopes of taking the city by
strong flank attacks, which are now
developing.
This is considered to aeocuut for the
iiesncrate German attacks in the
region of Lake Nobel, where they are
trying to prevent the Russian occupa
tion of the marshy land south of the
Stokhod, which would constitute a
serious monace to the left flank of
the German forces whose base is Ko
vel, and prove a valuable vantage
point to General Kaledlnes in the pros
sure he is exerting from the south.
Tterlln, Aug. 21, (via London.) The
Russian forces which crossed the
Stokhod River in Volhynia last week
made repeated attempts yesterday to
extend their positions. These efforts
the War Office announced today, were
repulsed with severe losses to the Rus
sian::.

BAKER ANSWERS COMPLAINTS
Says State Troops Will Be Returned
When Conditions Justify Such
it Step.
Washington, Aug. 21. The national
guard will be retained on the Mexican
border until it can be withdrawn with
out again endangering American lives
and property. Secretary Baker so
declared the administration's policy to
day in answering a score of letters
from many parts of the country com
plaining that the state troops were
being held in service after the emer
gency for which they were called out
apparently had passed.
In general the complainants whose
names were withheld allege mat Bor
der service was entailing loss finan
cially on militiamen and hardship on
their families. The secreary replied
to all those seeming to merit attea
Hon.
The department appreciates, Mr.
Baker said In one leter, the fact that
a call for military service upon mili
tia organizations must "inevitably pre
sent cases of hardship." He added:
"The emergency, however,
which required this call lor the
militia was one of a grave char
acter effecting the safety and lives
of citizens of the United States
men, women and children. The
presence of the militia on the
Mexican border has restored or
der and given a higher degree of
safety and security to the lives
of our people In that troubled
country than they have for a long
time had. The militia is there
fore performing a valuable ser
vice. '
Referring to the elaborate and ex
tensive training the militiamen are
receiving under supervision of regular
army officers' the secretary expressed
the opinion that It would enable them
could DCt have been obtained other
to act la time of war or other emer
gency us a supporting arm or second
line for the regular army, furnishing
in asset to national prepu'edness that
could not have been obtained other

"Clearly, so soon as a restored
state of order on the border Justi
fies it these troops will be re
turned to their homes," he wrote
"In the meantime, it is not possl
hie for the department to say how
soon such a situation will arise,
although the Mexican situation is
one of increasing hopefulness."
To another correspondent, the sec
rotary explained that the national
guard was maintained for just such
exigencies as that which DO exists
on the border and that it had cost the
government many millions to prepare

RECEIVERSHIP FOR B. & M.
President Hustis Sees No Hope of
Avoiding It.
Boston, Aug. 22. The opinion that
a receivership for the HoMon and

pressed by James II. Hustis, president
of the road. In an interview last night
"I see no hope of avoiding it," Mr
llustic said. "The reorganization
committee has no new plan to offer
the leased lines have not submitted
any new proposition and we have re
ceived no assurances that the note
holders would consent to another ex
tension of the noteu nor that the
bankers would recommend it again.'
The board of directors will meet to
day to consider the question of oh
taining a further renewal of $13,00''.
ooo in notes due on August 31. These
notes already have been extended
several times.
Mr. Hustis said further: "It kl in)
personal opinion that the notes will
not be extended again. I see no hope
for any thing but a receivership. This
is no threat or bluff.
'It Is not merely a matter of
tending the notes. The Boston and
Maine cannot go on forever with its
present unsound financial structure
nor with its physical condition as it
is today. The question ot whether
the road shall go into the hands of
receiver must be decided between nov
and the last dav of thlB mouth. H
may be decided tomorrow. The dl
rectors may vote not to extend the
notes or they may leave the matter
in the hands of the executive commit

RAILROAD HEADS
SEEK VIEWS OF
Committee Continues Its Sessions
Hoping to Avert Strike
PRESIDENT'S PLAN OPPOSED
Managers Insist Chief Executive's
Proposal Means Sacrifice of Ar
bitration Principle.
Washington, Aug. 22. It developed
today that the committee of railroad
managers had been in session the larg
er part of the night with out reaching
any definite conclusion. The commit
tee today is continuing its delibera
tions in an endeavor to find some
method of averting the threatened
strike. It is expected that members
of the committee will during the day
obtain the views of some of the larger
tockholders to aid in future delibera
tion.'.
Washington, Aug. 22. As one
Unerlcan citizen to another, Presl-
nt Wilson yesterday appealed to
each of the executl.es of the coun-
tty's principal railroads, on grounds
of patriotism, to accept his plan for
averting the threatened disaster of a
nation-wide strike. He emphasized
the necessity for keeping the railroads
In service as a part of the nation
al defense and to make possible
preparation for meeting condltloni
that will exist after the European war.
On leaving the White House, the
railroad presidents, augmented during
the day by arrivals from th'.- West,
held a conierence, al which sentiment
was said to be egainst agieelnj; to the
president's proposal In Us pressnt
form. Hope was expressed, however,
that some satisfactory counter-prop
osition might he advanced, ami it was
decided to turn over to a committee
the task of drafting a final reply to
the president.
The railroad heads slid insit
that President Wilson is a.-king them
to sacrifice tho principle of arbitra
tion. Kllsha Lee. chairman of the na
tional conference committee ot rail
ways, issued a statement last night,
in wlii. li he said- That the railroads
should grant, under threat of a na
tional strike, a $50,000,000 wage pre
ferment to a small minonr. of their
employes, without a hearing before a
public tribunal. Is Inconceivable in a
democracy like ours. All ciuestions at
issue Wages, hours, costs, operntlng
conditions are submerged bjf the
greater Isue: Shall arbitration bo
abandoned in the settlement of Indus
trial disputes?"
The statement suggests, however,
that railroads stand ready to take
whatever action the people of lhe
country desire. It concludes: 'The
weight of public opinion must deter
mine this Issue. We cannot beiiove
that it is the calm judgment of the
country that We should sacrifice the
principle of arbitration In Industrial
disputes under a throat to tie up I lie
commerce of the country."
While tho officials were listening
to President Wilson and later con
ferrlng at their hotel. the general
committee of 640 representatives of
the employes who already have ac
cepted the president's plan held s
perfunctory meeting anil marked tlm
awaiting the decision of the employ
ers. They said they would wait until
President Wilson dismissed them, but
stood roatly to call a strike should the
negotiations fail.

He aserted that investigations show-
that a family of five requires from 700

mined that a woman cannot live on
less than $8 a week, but three-fourths
of the women wage earners of the
country get less than that amount."
Father Ryan said:
