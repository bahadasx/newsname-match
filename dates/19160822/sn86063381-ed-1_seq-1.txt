NORMAL SCHOOL HERE
Party is Taken to Birchmont Beach

Bemidji is host to the state nor
mal school board, presidents of the
state normal schools and the state
superintendent of education today.
They arrived in tho city this morn
ing for the regular quarterly meet
in of the board.
A meeting was held at the library
building this morning at which plans
for the work of all normal schools

No Action Taken.
Plans were submitted for the sixth
normal school which is to be located
in Bemidji and the visiting party
looked over the site of the school.
No definite action was taken by the
board on the Bemidji institution. Al
though the last state legislature ap
propriated $25,000 lor the school,
which was available August 1, it ap
peared to be the consensus of opinion
of those present that all action for
the Bemidji school be postponed un
til the state legislature ffeets again
when a further appropriation will
be requested.
There was some discuss'on among
the members of the board in regard
to beautifying the site of the school.

Rail Strike May Be Avoided
RAILWAY HEADS
WILL AND MUST
YIELD IS BELIEF
Louis Kill Denies That He Would
Stand Forever Against an
Eight-Hour Day.
PRESIDENT OUTLINES
PROPOSALS TO RAILWAYS
Reported That Executives are Con
vinced Th^t They Will Get
Rate Increases.
(By Ujiited Press)
Washington, Aug. 22.The big
barons of the railway world are to
day deciding the question ot a strike
or no strike. A limited number of
the railway officials met to decide up
on a course. Late this afternoon they
will submit that course to the re
maining presidents and then the mat
ter will be presented to President
Wilson. Indications are that a
strike will be avoided but the big
barons are dying hard.
Heads Will Yield.
Several of the big railway heads
who met in an executive session last
night are getting in touch with their
directors this afternoon. President
Wilson is ready to meet them tonight
or tomorrow.
One rail executive today frankly
admitted that if President Wilson
feels that the public is with him, the
executives must and will yield. Un
doubtedly the roads will stand to the
end for some concessions.
It is reported that the xecutives
are convinced that they will get rate
increases from the interstate com
merce commission.
Louis W. Hill today denied that
he would stand forever against the
eight-hour day. He said, "I'm in
agreement with everybody. I'm not
an insurgent."
Against Arbitration.
The railroad heads still insist that
President Wilson ^asking them to
sacrifice the principle "of arbitration.
Elisha Lee, chairman cf the national
committee on railroads, issued a
statement in which he said:
"That the railroads should draft,
under threat of a national strike a
$50,000,000 wage preference to a
small minority of their employes
without a hearing before a public
tribunal is inconceivable in a demo
cracy like ours. All questions at issue
wages, hours, costs, operating con
ditionsare submerged by the great
er issue shall arbitration be aban
doned in the settlement of industrial
disputes?"
The statement suggests, however,
that the railroads stand ready to take
whatever action the people and the
country desire. It concludes:
"The weight of public opinion must
determine this issue. Wo cannot be
lieve it is the calm judgment of the
country that we should sacrifice the
principle of arbitration In industrial
disputes, under a threat to tie up the
commerce of the country."
President's Proposal.
The proposal from the president
now before the railroads is:
"1To adopt the eight-hour day
on a basis for wages even where the
actual work to be done cannot be
completed within eight hours, to
quote the president's words.
"2To increase the hourly rate of
pay 25 per cent.
"The result of the acceptance of
this proposal would be:
"1Absolutely on change in the
length of the work day.
"2An increase in wages of more
NYMORE READY FO ANNEXATION
Village, if Merged, Will Have Two
Precincts To Hold Meeting

Nymore is ready to be annexed to
Bemidji. Bonds have been floated for
the village indebtedness and the citi
zens are ready to take care of the re
maining indebtedness. An election
on the annexation will probably he

Auxiliary Fire Station.
A delegation of Nymore men at
tended the meeting of the city coun
cil last evening and presented a plan
whereby the city of Bemidji would
take over the village property tem
porarily, or until the outcome of the
election became known. If the elec
tion carries the property will oe
necessary for the city as a polling
place and as an auxiliary fire sta
tion.
The Nymore men who attended the
than $50,000,000 a year to about 4-5
of the train employes or less than one
seventh of all railroad employes, in
other words, an unfair wage prefer
ment would be granted without in
vestigation and under threat of a na
tional strike, to one man in seven in
the railroad strike."

KEPT FROM ALLIES
(By United Press)
St. Paul, Minn., Aug. 22.Pur-
chasers of dyes brought over from
Germany in the Deutschland, must
sign a contract that no part of the
dyes are to fall in the hands of Ger

meeting were J. T. Kutchera, J. W.
Smith, I. E. Joanis and H. T. Mather.
Mr. Smith explained to the council
the steps taken by the village in tak
ing up the indebtedness and re
quested that the city take over the
village property. 'He stated that the
property was valued at about $1,700
but that the village did not want
to sell it until the results of the an
nexation election became known.
Two More Precincts.
City Attorney Russell stated to the
council that he believed that the tak
ing over of the property by Bemidji
would be a wise plan. He stated
that if Nymore was annexted' part
of the present Fourth ward, the Mill
Park district, would be added to Ny
more and two more voting precincts
would be made there. The property
then could be used as a precinct vot

$11 0 A Month For A Four
Room Flat in Buenos Aires
Other Prices High Also
By Charles P. Stewart
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Buenos Aires, Aug. 1.(By mail)
A caxe of toilet soap retailing at
25c in the United States costs $1.71
here. This is typical of Argentine
prices generally. They are perfectly
terrific, stupifying, incredible.
Drugs cost three to four times what
they cost in North America ordinary
tooth brushes 80 cents each, every
day gloves $7 a pair.
A four-room, steam heated flat in
a good, but not aristocratic part of
this city, cannot be had for less than
$110 a month. A similar flat, minus
the heat, may be had at $52 80.
There are four or five months here
during which heat must be had, and
Cardiff coal, practically the only kind
on the market, costs from $28.16 to
$32.80 sometimes a bit more.
Transportation Creap.
In the remote suburbs tiny little
boxes of houses may be rented for
$32.50 a month, sans heat, sans light,
sans everything else except four
walls. These quarters are too far
away from the business center to be
considered by a man whose business
hours are at all exacting. Expen
sive heating and lighting must also
be considered. Transportation is
cheap. If he can spare the time, he
can travel twice daily for $4.40 a
month.
Meat is not high, as Argentina is a
meat country. The very fanciest
cuts of beefsteak may be had at 25
cents a pound. Ribs and rump steaks
cost 17 Y2 cents a pound, mutton 13,
veal 30 Ms cents and pork 22 cents.
Other items of household expense
will be about like this: Butter 44,
bread 5x/2,
coffee 44, tea 39%, granu
lated sugar lie, chickens 35 cents a
pound.
Milk costs 8 cents a quart. Eggs
are 48 cents a dozen. Potatoes cost
35 cents for 22 pounds. Oranges are
66 cents a dozen, bananas 32 cents
a dozen and apples 6 cents each.
Underclothes Cost $10.
A suit which* would -cost $25 in
New York or Chicago or San Fran
cisco, costs $45 in Buenos Aires. A
pair of $5 or $6 American shoes
costs $15. A $3 American hat costs
between $6 and $7. An ordinary
suit of winter underclothing costs
$10, United States money.
The man who buys his wife a not
over-fashionable walking suit must
pay $50 for it. If she is not too par
ticular, he can get her a bonnet for
$20.
If he wants to keep up with the
news, each paper costs him 4 cents.
The price of a 15-cent American
magazine is 26 cents.
The beer is good but it costs 13
cents per glass. A waiter must bring
each glass to a small table and every
time he expects a tip of 4 cents.
Whiskey, including the tip, is 22
cents a glass.
There is practically no such thing
as a cigar for less than 8 cents and
these are practically unsmokable. Ha
vana cigars cost from 44 cents up.
The man who falls ill will have to
pay an ordinary family doctor $5 a
visit. If his teeth hurt him, it will
cost him $5 an hour to have repairs
made, unless he goes to an expensive
dentist, in wMch case there is prac
tically no maximum limit.
People who like to keep clean must
pay their washerwoman approximate
ly the same prices as are charged
by the highest-priced New York laun
dries.
Costs Twice as Much.
Roughly speaking, it costs about
twice as much to live in Buenos
Aires as it costs to live, not perhaps
in New York, but in Chicago.
A citizen of the United States who
goes to the Argentine metropolis to
live, on the same salary he received
at home, may consider that his in
come has been cut in two, and will
be financially wise if he readjusts his
expenditures accordingly.
Living expenses are higher in Ar
gentina than in any other country in
South America.
In Brazil the average is only a lit
tle higher than in the United States.
Chile and the countries in the South
American north are rather cheap.
This does not refer to all commodities.
Some articles are very expensive. It
applies, however, to the average cost
of living.
As an offset against their lower
prices, incomes are generally lower
in the countries where living is
cheap.
Why prices are so high in Argen
tina is not entirely clear. For one
thing, the country's population is
small and it has plenty of money,
so that if the cash were evenly dis
tributed, the per capita wealth would
be high. Furthermore, it is not a
manufacturing country. It lacks
workingmen in sufficient numbers, it

PARALYSIS REPORTS
ARE HYSTERICAL
Minneapolis, Aug. 22.Dr. H. M.
Bracken, secretary of the state board
of health, said yesterday that reports
of infantile paralysis in Minnesota
are "hysterical" because all the so
called cases cannot be recognized as
such.
"I will hold a conference with
Governor Burnquist and take up the
adverse criticism of the board of
health, which is accused of inactivity,
and false alaarms about the disease
which may work hardship on Minne
sota. It would be easy for the ad
