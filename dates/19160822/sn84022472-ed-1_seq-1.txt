Mr. Allen told the court today that
he was given his regular day off and
took a. trip to Walnut Beach. . Near
11 o'clock he boarded a car .for
Bridgeport at Valnuf Beach station.
Aurilio and Herman also 'boarded the
car. i. The threes engaged in a con
versation and Allen, telling tljem that
he was stranger, asked Aurilio
where he could buy a glass of beer.
Gilbert replied that he knew a place
and all three alighted fromi the car
at East Main street, Stratford..
After Allen walked, a considerable
!tance he inquired of them con
cerning the saloon. They replied
"We will be there in a few minutes."
Allen said, "I . guess I won't bother,"
and' started to turn back. ''
,. Gilbert grabbed him by the throat,
he alleges, and Aurilio rifled his pock
ets. Having .procured the money
both disappeared in the darkness and
Allen made his Way back to East
Main street and Ferry Boulevard,
, He told Raymond McBrlde, who.
conducts the bar at the Stratford Inn
of. his encounter and of his. being
bereft of all his money..- State Po.

pened to be in Konnert's garage next

on the. highway a few hundred yards
beyond Washington bridge, Milford
Both were searched. On the person
of Gilbert was found $9.75 and Auri

also carried a skeleton key and Auri

up. Aurilio and Gilbert told Wheel

beach, having jumped .off the car at
Washington bridge. ;
'In court today Raymond McBrlde
