BELIEF THAT RAILROADS WILL YIELD TO THE PRESIDED
T
Cabinet Officers Confident
That Crisis Has Passed
Counter Proposal Waited
t By Aaaorlated Press.)
WASHINGTON, August 22. While
the railroad executives worked to
draft a counter proposal to the presi
dent's plan for averting a threatened
rail strike, the cabinet discussed the
situation fully and expressed confi
dence that In the end the railronds
would accept Wilson's plan. What
assurances the cabinet had for such
.
conclusion were not disclosed. The
cabinet members agreed that It was
not feasible to hurry the railroad ex
ecutives Into a decision, as they had
many things to consider., ...
A counter proposal 'is expected to
be the next step, but there is no out
ward Indication when this step will
be taken.
Elisha Lee, chairman of the Na
tional Conference Committee of Rail
ways, has issued a statement in
which he said:
"That the railroads should grant,
under threat of a national trike, a
$50,000,000 wage preferment to a
DEMOCRATS REVOLT
AGAINST
PRESIDENT
tBy Aaaoelaled Preaa.)
WASIIIXOTO.V, August 22. l'l-enident Wilson informed callers
today that ho will veto again the immigration bill if it reaches
him containing the literacy test. It has been reported that he might
fcign, hut it is stated emphatically that he is Ht ill opposed because
of the test.
The president's announcement, 'which settled the question,
arrived while, the Jjeimicratx were continuing their party row over
thft action of nine revolting Democrats who refused to be bound by
the caucus which decided to let the bill go over, and lenders of the
revolt making caustic replies to the reproaches of Senator Stone.
On the president's word the rebels turned and voted against the
motion to take up.
(By Aaaoelaled Preaa.)
WASHINGTON, August 22. An un
expected Democratic revolt In the
Senate yesterday resulted In the im
migration bill being taken up In de
fiance of the Democratic caucus and
opened the way for efforts to displace
the revenue bill as unfinished busi
ness, an action which might In
definitely prolong the session of Con
gress. ' -I
Ten Democratic senators voted with
the solid Republican minority to take
up the Immigration bill upon a mo
tion by Senator Smith; of South Caro
lina, chairman of the Immigration
committee.
Administration leaders said that
they had enough votes to defeat the
Smith motion to displace the revenue
bill. Even some of the revolting
Democrats have declared their inten
tion of voting against it. Should it
prevail the resulting fight over the
literacy test provision would upset
all adjournment calculations.
"It turns over to the Republican
minority the control of legislation,"
said Senator Stone. "I for one would
rather be In the position of standing
with the Democrats who remained
faithful to the party action than to
cross the aisle and Join hands with
the Republican minority."
Senator Stone's words aroused the
Ire of Senators Hardwlck and Smith,
of South Carolina.
"In view of some of the relations
that have come in this country since
the beginning of the European war,'
Senator Hardwick said, "I should
think even the opponents of the im
migration bill would be converted.
We should shut our doors until we
can Americanize the crowd we now
have, so that men on this floor might
light for the American flag without
fearing half baked foreigners, whose
allegiance, In their hearts, is to an
other country."

, PARIS, August 22. Newspapers comment at length on the
possibility of Rumania joining the war. Meetings in progress at
Bucharest are taken to mean that various developments in the
situation are being seriously considered and the general tone of
comment is decisive that the moment for Rumania's action has
arrived.
Operations of Bulgarian armies in Macedonia are interpreted as
having been undertaken solely with the view of influencing the
decision of Rumania. It is agreed that a new phase of Balkan
history is opening. The statement is made on good authority that
Rumanian troops number 800,000 armed men, in the best condition
after long preparation.

LONDON, August 22. The great
offensive opened by the allies Sunday
on the Saloniki front is developing,
but no decisive action has been
fought. The British and French ad
vancing on the right have crossed the
Struma, pushing northeastward to
wards the Bulgarian frontier. At the
same time the Serbians who have
opened a drive for Monastir report
the capture of Bulgarian first line
trenches. On the extreme left, how
ever, immediately south of Monastir,
they have suffered a reverse and
have evacuated the Greek town of
Ranica.
In the center, at the mouth of the
great valley of the Vardar, the main
highway through Serbia, violent ar
tillery action is in progress. It was
down this valley that the Teuton-
Bulgarian forces made their victori
ous advance, and according to mili
tary experts its possession is vital
to whoever liolds Serbia.
Reports from Saloniki say that
Italian troops have landed there and
will Join In the ' general offensive.
This, If corroborated, means that
Italy has decided formally to declare
war on Germany, as the Germans are
admittedly directing the Bulgarian
campaign. At certain points on the
front Berlin reports the Bulgarians
on the offensive, but London and
Purls Interpret this as a move for
political purposes and not as a seri
ous atlack against Saloniki. A de
