This dispatch is as yet uncon
firmed from other sources, though
Bulgarian forces are known to
have advanced to a position a few
miles north of Serres (forty miles
northeast of Saloniki). The last of
ficial dispatches reported French
forces attacking this Bulgar de

Germany Denies
Loss of Submarine
BEfRLIN (via wireless to Sayvllle),
Aug. 22,-The British admiralty claims
that a German submarine was rammed
and sunk In the North sea naval tight
on Tuesday, In which two British war
ships were sunk, was officially denied
today by the German admiralty.
The submarine was only slightly dam
aged by a destroyer that tried to ram
her after she had sunk a British cruiser
of the Chatham class (the Nottingham).
The British claim that another sub
marine was sunk cannot be verified
until all the German submarines return
to port.
"Furthermore," started the admiralty,
"the British report that the German
high seas fleet receded before tho Brit
ish high seas force Is a pure product
of imagination. No such British force
appeared,"

BRITISH CABINET MOVIES ?
MY WORD; IT WON'T DO
LONDON, Aug. 22. The English cabinet won't appear In
the movies, after all, Premier Asquith announced this afternoon.
Mrs. Asquith, wife of the prime minister, conceived the
idea of filming the ministers, the proceeds to go to a War
charity. The fact that President Wilson had posed for the
movies was used as an argument.
Bu the plan shocked Commons, and brought down a storm
of- talk that it -was a most undignified thing to do. The news

By WILLIAM
PETROQRAD, Aug. 22.-A bill to abol

.rights as other Russian subjects will be
Introduced In the Imperial Duma when
that body convenes In November.
Prof. Paul Miliukov so Informed the
United Press today, followed his return
from a visit to England, France and
Italy with other members of the Rus
sian house.
"This bill has the suppprt of the Pro
gressive party in the Duma: therefore,
of the majority." said Miliukov.
"It Will contain three essential parts.
The first has for Its object the removal
of the pale (within which the Jews of
Russia with a few exceptions have had
to make their homes), thus enabling
them to live wherever they choose.
Educational Limitations, Too.
"The second will remove some of the

DEATH RATE SAME,
DESPITE EPIDEMIC
New York Mortality Statistics
For Thirty-four Weeks Vir
tually Unchanged.
NEW YORK, Aug. 22. In spite of the
1.660 deaths for which Infantile paralysis
has been blamed, the death rate for the
first thirty-four weeks of this year has
been almost precisely the same as that
of the same period last year.
The Increase has been at the rate of
four deaths to each 100,000 of population.
This year so far the rate from all causes
has been 14.67 per thousand of popula
tlon ; last year for this period It was
14.63.
In every age group except that of chil
dren under five years there has been a
decrease In the death rate. Health Com
missioner Emerson, In commenting upon
the situation yesterday, said that this
proves that the general sanitary condi
tion of the city Is better this year than
last, but there are those who believe
that the fact that the death rate remains
practically stationary Is because many
deaths of children are ascribed to Infan
tile paralysis which In normal years
would be otherwise diagnosed.
The fact that there is a decrease In
the rate of deaths from dlarrhoeal dis
eases lends strength to the belief that
some deaths which would normally be
charged to these diseases have been
charged this year to infantile paralysis.
An Increase In the number of cases
and deaths of Infantile paralysis for a
period of twenty-four hours accom
panied the heat wave here today.

No One at Pier Forced to Run
Gauntlet of Customs Offi
cials on Landing.
NEW YORK, Aug. 22.-Vhen the
French liner I-Jifayette arrived yester
day from Bordeaux there was no one
on hand from the offlco of Collector of
the Port Malone to greet William a.
Sharp. American-ambassador to France,
although his return to this country
was known beforehand.
Consequently Mr. Sharp, who was ac-j
cuiupumru uj (113 unugnier, .Margaret,
had to run tho gauntlet of the customs
Inspectors before it was discovered that
he was an ambnssador. exemnt from
examination, and suitable apologies
were made.
Mr. Sharp said he was here mainly
to iccover from the effects of a se
vere attack of pneumonia two months
ago. In view of tho fact that Am
bassador Page, American representa
tive to Great Britain, preceded him
here, he was asked if the return of
both to Washington had any special
significance.
Ambassador Sharp Is a diplomat. He
merely said he would be three or
four wAks In this country, and hoped
to completely recover from his attack
of pneumonia. After two or three days
In this city, ho snld, ho will go to Wash
ington to discuss Important matters
with tho State Department, and then he
will go to his home in Elyrla, Ohio.
What the Important matters were he
did not say.
Ambassador Sharp has not been here
for two years.
State Department officials announced
today that Ambassador Sharp Is ex
pected In Washington.

Railroads Expected to Accept
President's Plan Rather Than
Force Tie-up.
Following n meeting of tho Cabinet to
day, conftdenco was expressed by tho
President's advisors that a settlement
of tho railroad controversy would bo
reached shortly without n strike.
Ten opinion was expressed that In the
final analysis tho railroads would yield
and accept tho President's proposition
rather than Insur the loss of hundreds
of millions of dollars which a strike of
even a few days would mean.
The situation growing out of the ef
forts of tho President to bring tho two
sides togothar was fully discussed at the
meeting.

Once the bill Is sent back to confer

delay, and will make another effort to
patch up the bill. Opinion Is divided
whether any agreement Is possible or
whether a continuing resolution applying
to the old appropriation act will have to
be put through.

COMMITTEE BUSY ALL NIGHT-
Some Talk Heard That Road.
Heads Are Considering Pos
sible Trades With Men.
The greatest industrial struggle
in the history of the country hangs
in the balance today.
The question of acceptance or
rejection of the proposals made by
President Wilson in an effort to'.
avert a strike that would tie up the
railroads of the country, has now
been passed to the men whose
money is invested in the great ar
teries of the nation's" trade.
As the situation stands this
afternoon the employes have put
their demands for an eight-hour
day and time and a half over
time in the hands of the Presi
dent. He has put it up to the heads
of the great systems, and they, in
turn, have passed it on to the direc
tors. After an all-night session the se
lect committee of big executives
appointed by the two score presi
dents faited to reach any decision.
They then wired their directors,
and upon the reply from the money
powers behind the country's trans
portation systems' largely rests the
final result.
CONFERENCES COSTLY.
In the meantime, the high-salaried
railroad executives continued to perspire
and wrestle with the various angles of
the critical negotiations. .With the sala
ries and expenses of the various rail
road heads and union officials,, the
negotiations are costing between I25.0W
and 130,000 a day, it Is estimated.
There Is no doubt that a division
exists among the railroad heads.
Against one faction which favors
"trading" with the President in accept
ing the eight-hour day principle, is an
other group violently opposed to any
step that would weaken .their stand de
manding arbitration on all matters.
A short session, attended by all of the
two score railroad presidents, was held
during the morning, after which the fol
lowing announcement was Issued:
"Mr. Hale Holden. president of the
Burlington, as spokesmen of the rail
road executives, who are conferring
with President Wilson on the railroad
wage problem, announced this morning
that a committee from the three-score
executives now In Washington have
been named for tho general considera
tion of the questions lnvoivca.
"The members of the committee are:
Halo Holden. of the Burlington and
Qulncy W. W. Alterbury, Pennsyl
vania; Fairfax Harrison. Southern: R.
a. ixvctt, union iacjiic, v. i. rupioy.
Atchison, Topeka. and Santa Fo- Al
fred H. Smith. New York Central;
Frnnk Trumbull. Chesapeake and Ohio;
Daniel Wlllard. Baltimore and Ohio.
"The committee Is In continuous ses
sion considering the situation, and It
Is understood that no conclusion has
yet been reached." .
Chairman Hurley, of the Federal
Trade Commission, called upon the
executives this morning.
The- executives went Into formal ses
sion at 11 o'clock.
At the Metropolitan Club last night
with coats and In some cases, collars
off, the railroad men labored with their
problem until an early hour today. They
then adjourned, and opinion prevailed
that a peaceful adjustment of tho
threatened commerce crisis would be
effected.
The roads are dying hard, however.
They will not yield, it was declared,
unless they can trade with tho Presi
dent, .and gain some "offsetting ad
vantage." some "adequate compensa
tion" for accepting what they regard as
"a revolutionary chango" In tho eight
hour day.
Sign of Settlement.
But the very fact that many of the
small road chiefs, as well as a number
of the foremost railroad executives,
have reached tho stage where they are
willing to "talk trades" indicates the
President hB stirred what ho termed
"the lmmobllo opinion" of tho railroad
powers.
It was rumored today that tho Balti
more and Ohio and the Southorn rail
road executives are ready to make con
cessions, and President Halo Holden, of
tho Burlington, In whose hands I.ouis
W. Hill has placed power for negotiat
ing for the Hill lines, is reported op
posed to rejecting unequivocally tho
Proli!cnt'n nronosat.
On the othor hond. oarly this morn
ing tho Pennsylvania and tho New
York Central were said to be holding
out strong against yielding the point
of arbitration. A majority of the gieat
er systems appeared to be with them.
Throughout the night telegrams kept
pouring Into tho headquarters of the
executives and managers appeals from
merchants and manufacturing orgnnl
xatlons in all the big cities of th coun
tryurging the chiefs to stand pat on
arbitration.
Editorial clippings from metropolitan
dallies, supporting the stand of the rail
roads, were lent to the Metropolitan
Club for guidance of the chiefs there.
Out of today's situation belief growa
that the roads will yield in the end.
"There will ba no strike," said ona
