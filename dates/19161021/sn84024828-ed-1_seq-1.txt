NO. 53.

POSED ON
SEVEN I
In the superior court yesterday,
Judge Ellis imposed the sentences
given below upon the following named
men who have pleaded guilty to or
been convicted of bootlegging charges
during the last few days:
Morris Jensen, 300. fine and 18
months in jail.
Joe Martinez, $300 fine and 6
months in jail.
William Owens, 5250 fine and 3
months in jail.
Frank Guernsey, $250 fine and
months in jail.
A. A. Alexander, $250 fine and
months in jail.
John C. Martin, $200 fine and
days in jail.
30
Simon Jaurique, $150 fine and 10
days in jail.
Jensen, who received the heaviest
sentence, was convicted of ' a similar
offense several months ago. He plead
ed guilty when arraigned for the sec
ond offense.
Martinez is the proprietor of a pool
hall at Golconda. He stood trial, his
case being the first called. His con
viction is believed to have caused sev
eral others to plead guilty.
Owens, who received the same sen
tence as Guernsey and Alexander, ap
parently would have liked to have di
vulged in court the name of his silent
partner. It was evident that he was
thinking seriously of doing so, as he
mentioned having had such a partner
while being questioned by the county
attorney. He pleaded guilty.
Alexander has posed as a tailor in
the town of Oatznan for several
months. It is claimed that he was
doing business in the proper way, hav
ing provided himself with all the fix
tures necessary, including a bar.
Martin is from Chloride and is sup
posed to have been tending bar in one
of the illegal booze emporiums in the
lead camp. ,
Jaurique was only a comparatively
slight offender and, as a result re
ceived the lightest sentence.
Many other alleged bootleggers are
awaiting trial and it is likely that
many days will be consumed by the
court in dealing with the cases.
RETURN FROM VISIT
TO THEIR OLD
E
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Mclver and son,
Eobert, returned to Oatman Tuesday
afternoon after spending the greater
part of the summer traveling and
visiting their old home in Canada.
On leaving Oatman they visited San
Francisco, Portland, Seattle and then
went through Canada to their old
home at Alberta. On the return trip
they visited Chicago, St Louis, Kan
sas City and many other cities.
Mr. Mclver having returned it is
expected that after a conference with
George W. Long, his partner, they
will make known future plans for
the Lazy Boy, Green Quartz, Telluride
and other properties which they own
or control. Most properties in which
they are interested are well financed
and. suspension of operations on them
during the hot weather was only tem
porary. Many needed improvements
have been made on the surface at some
of the properties and everything in
dicates a general resumption of opera
tions in the near future.
AUCTION SALE HELD
(From Thursday1" Dally Miner.)
At the auction sale of machinery,
held yesterday morning by the Santa
Fe railroad, the Kingman Traders ac
quired some bargains in corrugated
iron, pipe, window sash and other ma
terial. Mining timbers and lumber were bid
in by the Desert Power and Water
company. There being no bidders for
the engines, stamp mill, etc., they will
be shipped to San Francisco for sale
there.
CASWELL HAPPY
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
Registration Officer H. M. Caswell is
the happiest man in Oatman these
days, he having completed his task of
registering local voters. Mr. Caswell
states that the past three months have
been the only black chapter in his
siege by those who wanted to reg
istering voters, he states that he has
become acquainted with the disposition
of more people this summer than he
thought possible in a lifetime. He
kept his office in the Oasis and visit
ed every section of the district in quest
of voters.
While he was in the office some were
looking for him at the Times mine,
and when out of the office was be
sieged by those who wonted to reg
ister. Some made the trip to the of
fice as many as five times before they
found Mr. Caswell in. On the second
or third trip they would begin to get
discouraged. On the fourth and fifth
attempts to register they would get
mad, and when at last Mr. Caswell
was located there was a fine flow of
language in store for him. He would
explain why he had been absent, only
to be told: "That's what they all
say." Now that the work is over, Mr.
Caswell will take a quiet vacation,
where he will not hear anything re
garding voters and politics. He re-
fuses to tell where he is going, but Uhe election, the measure will be lost,
his friends are of the opinion that heVThe Arizona State Federation of
will take to the nearby mountains.
ATHLETIC CLUB TO
RE
(From Oatman Section Daily Miner)
That the athletically inclined people
of Oatman will associate themselves
together in an amateur athletic club
is now a settled fact Talk of the or
ganization of a club has been heard
for some time.
A meeting for- tl purpose of formu
lating plans and other preliminary
preparations will be held in the near
future. The time and place of the
meeting will be announced soon. All
who are interested in amateur athlet
ics will be invited and asked to give
their views. There are many athletes
here and it is expected that an excel
lent club will be the outcome of the
meeting. Harry Simmons, of the Lovin
& Withers' store, is one of the most
enthusiastic supporters of the organi
zation.
T
(From Oatman Section Daily Miner)
At the Crescent driving of the tun
nel continues in a satisfactory man
ner. The management is of the opin
ion that there will be something of
importance to report in the near fu- j
ture. The tunnel is in 500 feet and I
a change of formation is taking place.
The change is from andesite to calcite.
This change is near the point at which
it is expected the vein will be dis-
closed and the management is optimis-j
tic. I
The Crescent is located near the
Adams and Wrigley properties, and j
considered a promising property. ,
George Peirce is manager and under.
his supervision everything has run
smoothly since commencement of
operations. The company is well fin-1
anced and development work will be
prosecuted until the entire estate is i
explored.
TO ATTEND INSTITUTE
(From Thursday's Daily Miner.)
The county school superintendent
and all Kingman teachers left yester
day on the morning train for Pres-
cott, where they will attend the teach
er's institute to be held there during
Northern Arizona Fair week. The
fair started yesterday and will last
until next Saturday. Among the
party were Mrs. R. A. Lassell, Vida
Watkins, Leona Hoffman, and W. L.
Linville.
RAY RETAINED
James C. Ray, a mining geologist,
has been retained by the Victor Cop
per company as consulting engineer.
STATES POSITION
IE
IFrom Oatman Section Daily Miner.
A considerable amount of printed
matter has been received by the Oat
man Miners' Union relative to the
stand taken on the various initiative
measures and constitutional amend
ments by the Arizona State Federa
tion of Labor. The principal meas
ures called to the attention of the
voters are the four which the Federa
tion proposed.
Another measure which the organ
ization is giving considerable atten
tion is known as Senate Bill No. 32.
It is claimed that should this meas
ure become a law at the coming elec
tion the initiative power will thereby
be taken from the people. The meas
ure proposes a change of but a single
word in the present law. This word
is "thereat" instead of "therefor"
It is claimed that should this change
be made it will require a majority of
all' votes cast at any election to pass
an initiative measure.
At present there are but a small
number of the voters who vote one
way or the other for any initiated
measure. If the bill receives say 24,
000 votes in the affirmative and 1,000
votes in the negative and there is
total number of 50,000 votes cast at
Labor takes the stand that any meas
ure should become a law which re
ceives a majority of all votes cast for
or against the measure, and that it
should not require a majority of all
votes cast
H ORERODIES ARE
BEING DEVELOPED IN
TOM REED PROPERTIES
(From Oatman Section Dailr Miner.)
Exploratory work df, the past few
months in the various new workings
of the Tom Reed Mining company
has proven its ore deposits greater
than was ever dreamed of in the early
days. Every foot of drifting and
sinking at the Gray Eagle and Aztec
shafts, it is said, shows the orebody
to better advantage. A seemingly
unlimited supply of ore is in sight
At the Red Cloud shaft numerous
stringers of high gold ore have been
encountered and any day may put the
shaft into the orebody, which it is
I thought will be proven to be the con
tinuation of the United Eastern shoot
A new shaft has been started on the
Gray Eagle claim about 750 feet west
of the Bald Eagle shaft . This de
signed to pick up the Aztec vein.
Another discovery of importance to
the Tom Reed is reported at its Crown
City property, three miles to the north
of the main workings. A shaft has
been sunk to a depth of 125 feet
An inch stringer, cut in the shaft
at a depth of about 90 feet has wid-
ened to three feet in a vertical depth
of thirtv feet Tfc is snirl .that.
values have been obtained and that
the ore is almost identical to that
of the main workings.
So much ore is in sight that mining
men well versed in the affairs of the
Tom Reed nreHIrt trip huiln'inr' of a
new mill or big enlargement of the
present plant The management is
non - committal on this point, and also
states that no new strikes have been
made, adding that the showings in
the new shafts are only commonplace
developments.
(From Chloride Section Daily Miner)
Outside newspapers are beginning
to note our arrival among the top
notchers. We have been too busy dig
ging ore to find time to blow the horn.
But when the news finally filtered
through to the outside that Chloride
has produced $40,000,000 and is now
engaged in the pleasant pastime of
digging an6ther $40,000,000, capital
began to stop, look and listen. Now
the wealthiest and most powerful min
ing groups are coming in and acquir
ing holdings.
EXCELLENT RESULTS
BEING OBTAINED AT
GOLD DUST PROPERTY
(From Oatman Section Daily Miner.)
Exploration of the Gold Dust ore-
body is yielding pleasing results,
Each shift is proving it of greate:
width and depth.
In a winze being sunk from the 200
foot level the ore deposit has been
proven for a vertical depth of 475 feet
At present the width of much of the
vein is not known but the winze was,
and is yet, in good milling ore with its
walls unexposed. For a depth of 75
feet in the winze, it is said, the values
run from szo to S41 per ton. no
ore runs up to the surface but the
values are not so high, although most
of it is of a good milling grade.
It is said that the orebody has been
proven sufficiently to run a large mill
for several years. As the old Gold
Dust mill is of an obsolete type talk
of the construction of a new plant is
heard. It will not be necessary to con
struct new buildings as the old mill
building is in good condition. With
the installation of new mill machinery
the Gold Dust should become one of
the large producers of Oatman.
A new pulverizer is expected to ar
rive at the Gold Dust soon and with
its arrival experiments will begin.
Test runs of the ores of the district
will be made within a month or six
weeks.
GILA PINAL COMPANY
T
(From Friday's Dally Miner.)
Two shafts are being sunk on the
property of the Gila Pinal Copper
company, in the Superior district No.
shaft has reached a depth of 100
feet and No. 2 a depth of 100 feet It
is the intention of the management to
sink to a depth of 500 feet, with cross
cuts every 100 feet to ascertain the
exact width of the vein.
In the work that has been done on
old assessments, the sulphide vein has
been crosscut 76 feet without either
the hanging wall or the footwall be
ing reached. Twenty-two men are em
ployed on the property at present, and
the force will be increased in the im
mediate future. Although the present
owners have had control of the prop
erty but a short time, sufficient is
known to warrant the belief that the
property has one of the richest bodies
of ore in the Superior district Over
5000 feet of development work has
been done at different times, and
shows the property to be well min
eralized in all parts.
A number of Phoenix business men,
headed by J. H. Henness and H. G.
Murphy, are financing the property.
They expect within a short time to be
gin shipping ore to the Hayden smel
ter. ENOUGH ORE TO KEEP
MILL BUSY FOR YEARS
(Frow Chloride Section Dally Miner)
The ore now available for treatment
will swamp several custom mills for
years to come. Capital will find a fer
tile field here for investment in re
duction plants. The 500-ton plant now
promised will not be able to make a
dent in the mountains of ore that are
aiting for treatment
CHLORIDE HOTELS ARE
FILLED TO OVERFLOWING
(From. Chloride Section Dally Miner)
The Ryan hotel nas been turning
people away for. the past week in
greater numbers than ever. Monday
evening Mrs. Quigley, proprietor, re
luctantly confessed her inability to
house 19 prospective guests. The "All
Rooms Taken" sign is hung up early in
the morning these days of rush and
bustle.
Chloride is badly in need of anothei
hotel. Strangers are sorely tried at
times to find a place to stay over
night The camp is growing so rapid-
that another hotel is a crying ne
cessity. As a rule, rooming houses are
the first thing noticed in mining camps
where a rush is in progress, but Chlor
ide is the one exception. When it is
taken into consideration that $1.50 is
the regular price charges, it would
seem that an investment of this kind
would be most inviting.
SON OF PRESIDENT
GARFIELD ILL VOTE
FORiODROlfflLSON
(From Friday's Dally Miner.)
James R. Garfield, Son of the late
ex-president, who seeks to be sec-
retary of the interior in the event the
republicans are successful in the com-
ing campaign, is a great supporter of
Justice Hughes, but his brother, H. A.
Garfield, who asks nothing at the
hands of any political party, and who
is,
therefore, in a position to unre-
serveaiy express himself, is a warm
admirer and supporter of President
Wilson.
J. R. Garfield recently made
speaking tour through Arizona for
Hughes and the Republicans made
much of the fact that the ion of the
great president was supporting the
head of the Republican ticket How
ever, they did not state that President
Garfields other son was an admirer
of Woodrow Wilson.
ton, Mr. Garfield went on record for
President Wilson in the following
language:
Dear Mr. Burton:
"May I reply informally to your
circular letter of the 8th of September
in which you appeal to me, not as a
partisan, but as a college man, to en
roll as a member of the Hughes nat
ional college league? Highly as I
honor Mr. Hughes I have decided to
support Mr. Wilson. His character
as a man, his sympathetic under-

Ui -"" ttuureuu Ui "le ua
his record in office, his unusual ability,
pre-eminently displayed in meeting
and dealing with three great emergen-
cies of his administration, and the
importance of maintaining an unin-
terrupted policy at this juncture in
the world affairs lead me to believe
that the best interests of our country
will be served in keeping the present
admimstration and its party in office
lor me present, i nave, therefore,
enrolled myself with the league of m-
dependent voters of Massachusetts.
i-ermit me to add that the sec-
uonai issue, raisea Dy some oi our
Republican leadrs, is repugnant to the
American spirit and the welfare of
1 . i I
our institutions. Under the circum
stances, it offends the sense of fair
dealing with political opponents, it
tends to arouse old fires of passion
and, if successful, will disunite a peo
ple now united and, incidentally, de
stroy the party that fosters so calami
tous an issue. Sincerely yours,
"H. A. GARFIELD."

SURVE
GLADSTONE PROPERTY
(From Chloride Section Dally Miner)
J. T. Degman, the road and tunnel
contractor, has been engaged to find
a route and build a road from the
Black Jack to the Gladstone. Mr. Deg-
man is now surveying in an attempt
to find a route with a practical grade.
This road is needed very much, as it
will open the way to several good
properties in the higher hills in the
east and southeast portion of the dis
trict which are now accessible only by
trail.
The road to the Black Jack from the
mouth of Alum wash is to be built
without delay. This road will be near-
two miles long. It is thought that
the Gladstone can then be reached
from 'the Black Jack with a road not
to exceed half a mile in length.
Road construction is a bit expen
sive, but as the Black Jack and neigh-
boring properties have need of it now
t0 transport their ore down and sup
plies up, it has been decided that it
Black jck continues to exiLet ita
high grade product and has Indians
scouring the hills for additional burros
to be use in packing the ore from the
mine to Tramway landing.
From Chloride Section Daily MlnerJ
Lee McCoy returned from the river
district Monday, bringing several
pounds of specimen rock spattered
plentifully with free gold. The quartz
is pure white, carrying iron oxides and
copper stains. The quartz shown here
is from a hole 20 feet deep, and Mc-
Coy says that the same values can be
found in every foot sunk from'the sur-
face.
Had such rock been exhibited in
Goldfield in the days of the boom there
would have been an old-fashionerf
stampede to the new diVrine-s. A few
people left here for the scene of the
strike. Mining men predict that the
