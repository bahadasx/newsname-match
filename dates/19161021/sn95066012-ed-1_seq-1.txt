SYMPATHETIC MORETOWN MAN
Read of Bcston Woman's Misfortunes
and Married Her.
Boston. Oct. 18. As a result of ad
vertising for a husband four months
ago, Mrs. Viola A. Ling became en
gaged to a man who fled from town
on the day that had been named for
the wedding, leaving Mrs. Ling wait
ing at the church. But this desertion
was not without compensation, for
the story, published In various news
papers, found its way to Robert J.
Bradley, Moretown, Vt. It excited his
interest, caused him to write to her,
then to visit her, finally to marry her,
and last night Mrs. Bradley set otf
for Moretown to join the man whose
name she bears.
Bradley, who Is a wealthy farmer,
married Mrs. Ling in East Boston last
Saturday evening. The bride, who
had been living at 5 Ottawa street,
Roxbury, had some packing to do.
and many good-bys to say to frineds.
But Bradley had business Interests
which made it necessary for him to
return home at once. Mrs. Bradley
completed her preparations for the
journey yesterday morning aud set
out for Vermont last nighf.
"I am the happiest woman In the
world." she explained to friends lie
fore departing. "I have had 'my
troubles, but they are all ended now."
Four months ago she advertised in
the newspapers for a husband. ' One
man answered. He said he wanted a
wife who could cook, and Mrs.- Ling
invited him to come to her home for a
trial feast. He feasted to his heart's
content for two weeks. Then on the
day the two were to be married, the
man departed without a farewell.
The story of the woman's misfor
tune was reported in the newspapers.
Up in the little town of Moretown,
Vt Robert Bradley, a widower, read
it. He was sympathetic and lonely.
So he sent an engagement ring and
$20 to Mrs. Ling, telling her that if
she would place her faith In him she
would not be "left waiting at the
church.'' The courtship by mail pro
gressed rapidly, and last Thursday
Bradley loft his farm and came to
Boston.
First he bought the wedding ring.
Then he purchased the wedding gown,
and ho gave his bride a new set of
false teeth. The marriage took place
at 8 o'clock Saturday evening in the
homo of James Frascr. C Macbeth
street. East Boston. Justice of the
Peace Eraser performed the cere
mony and a score of friends Joined in
the celebration which lasted until

PRIESTS NOT IN POLITICS
Cardinal Gibbons Make Denial of
Anti-Wilson Propaganda.
Cardinal Gibbons nt Baltimore has
given to a correspondent of the New
York World the following denial that
an organized movement to influence
Roman Catholic voters against Presi
dent Wilson exists:
"I ne-ver have heard until this mo
ment that any Roman Catholic propa
ganda existed in Indiana or else
where In opposition to the re-election
of President Wilson. I do not be
lieve there Is any truth In it. For
myself, 1 am not in politics and I
never have authorized anyone lo
quote me as favoring either candidate
for the presidency. Every Catholic
voter has an inherent right to vote
according to its own individual con
pclence, and I am sure that the Roman
Catholic hlerachy of the United States
would never ' interfero w ith that
right."

Firm Believes Systematic Pilfering
Has Been in Progress
TWO MEN PUT UNDER ARREST
One Discovered in Building at Night,
the Other Caught In North
Adams. I
For some time members of the firm
of Bottum & Torrance have had a
suspicion that systematic pilfering of
materials and finished products has
been in progress at their factory at
the corner of Main and Mill streets
and a climax was reached about mid
night Thursday when Walter Viault, a
former employe, was discovered in the
building by the watchman, Ford Hur
ley, and severely handled.
According to the watchman's story,
Viault showed fight when discovered
on the third floor of the factory but
was no match for the burley guard
ian of the property who used his fists
and a hammer on the Intruder and
ended the encounter by kicking Viault
down the stairs. Viault was later ar
rested and taken to the county jail
where his bruises were attended by a
physician. His face was pummeled
almost beyond recognition and he was
so lame Friday that he was hardly
able to walk.
Messrs. Bottum and Torrance, with
the assistance of Corporation Attor
ney Bennett and Officers Hurley,
Brazil and Perrott, started an inves
tigation which resulted in the arrest
in North Adams of Ralph Clark, an
employe at the factory. A trunk
filled with materials from the factory,
some of which, Mr. Bottum says, must
have been taken nearly a year ago,
was recovered. The corporation at
torney, Mr. Bottum and Officers Brazil
and Hurley went to North Adams Fri
day night by automobile and returned
with Clark who is now in the keeping
of Sheriff Godfrey.
When seen at the North Adams
jail, Clark, alter some questioning,
showed a disposition to tell what he
knew about the pilfering at the fac
tory which he intimated was far more
extensive than the proprietors of the
business imagined. More develop
ments are expected when the case
conies before the court.
While they have not much evidence
to substantiate the bejief the members
of the firm and the officials are con
vinced that material In the form of
cotton cloth, sheets and pillow cases
and collars have been taken from the
factory for some time and that the
plunder has been disposed of outside
of the state.
Viault comes from one of the best
families in Arlington and has hitherto
borne a good reputation. He ha a
wife and several children who have
the sympathy of all. His friends be
lieve that this trouble is due to his
getting into habits of dissipation
while his wife Is away to care for her
aged father.
