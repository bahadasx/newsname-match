PFSt'KJHKS SlTl'ATION.
That Chill Is absolutely unable to
export any of her grain Is the state
ment of Thomas H. J. Rrown of San
tiago, Chill, representative of a Liver
pool grain f:rm. Mr. lirown Is In
Pendleton today looking over the
wheat situation.
No vessels at nil will come around
the Horn to Chill after her grain,
says Mr. Ilrown, because they can get
cargoes on the east coast, thus saving
time and insurance. Such few ves
sels as do come to Chill will load with
nothing but metals and nitrates, he
states, as the warring nations want
these products more than they do
wheat. In consequence there Is about
100,000 tons piled up waiting for the
lime to come when It can be export
ed. Mr. Brown stntes he finds a similar
situation on tho west coast of this
country.' When he left home, he says,
the farmers were Just seeding and will
not harvest their crops until January,
lie expects good crops though he says
that grain U not the chief product ot
Chill.

DAMAGE CASE BEFORE
THE JURY TONIGHT
Final AreunieiitM In HletLsoc Case
Made Thin Afternoon Plaintiff Re
lying Chiefly on Testimony of
Morgan's Companions.
Argument Is being made this after
noon to the Jury In the damage suit
brought by Mrs. Bledsoe against the
O-W. R. ft N. Co. for the death of her
son, John Milton Morgan. The case
will probably be turned over to the
Jury at 6 o'clock.
The plaintiff is relying chiefly up
on the testimony of the companions
of young Morgan who declare that
Morgan was kicked off the train by
James McMahan, a brakeman. How
ever, one of these witnessed was dis
credited when, under cross examina
tion, he admitted that he had sworn
falsely to his own name In an attempt
to hide his real Identity. It was also
brought out that he is an escape from
the reform school at St. Anthony.
Idaho. He gave his name as Sam
Davis but later admitted it was Her
bert McGee.
The defendant relies chiefly upon
the testimony of McMahon which was
to the effect that, as the train pulled
out, he saw the three men riding be,
tween the cars and noticed that one
of them was In a dangerous position.
He signaled for the train to slow down
he said, and Jumped aboard. He at
tempted to pull the boy Into a safe
position, he testified, bi;t his foot was
caught In a safety chain and he was
pulled under the wheels. McMahon
testified that he lost his balance and
fell also, striking on his head and
shoulders. On cross examination
plaintiff sought to show that the
point, where McMahon says he fell Is
170 feet from the blood spots where
Morgan was killed. They also put In
testimony to show thst M'-Mihon
Jumped off the train and alighted on
his feet.
Both sides are attacking the chief
witnesses of the other and the case
appears to hang upon the Judgment
which the Jury has of tho witnesses.
Arthur Clark spoke first for the
plaintiff and was followed, by Attor
ney Riley for the company. C. H.
Carter will probably follow for the
defendant and Frederick Stclwer will
close for the plaintiff.

Mrs. Adah Wallace Unruh. state or
