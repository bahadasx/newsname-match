MEXICANS "DRUNK"
WASHINGTON, Oct 20. General
Funston, reporting tonight on the ex
change of shots across the border a
San Jose, said that late reports reach
ing him indicated that the American
troops were fired upon "by drunken
Mexicans'.
The dispatch made no mention of
firing by the American troops and said
there were no casualties n either
side. Officials here were inclined to
attach little significance to the inci
dent, believing that an irresponsible
band had blundered upon the detach
ment of Americans and withdrawn
after firing a few desultory shots.
There was nothing in Gen. Funs ton's
dispatch, it was said, to indicate a
prolonged engagement
