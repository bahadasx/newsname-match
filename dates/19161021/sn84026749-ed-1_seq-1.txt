The- Main Feature.
The essential points of Mr, Fafnham's
report to tho national committee are
as followst
"California Is absolutely safe for
Governor Hughes by a largo plurality,
and Gov. Hiram Johnson will be elected
United States Benator by an over
whelming vote. The women of Cali
fornia are doing most, cffectlvo work for
Mr. Hughes, and among them are many
who had previously been affiliated with
the Democratic party.
"Colorado la always a close State.
Early In the campaign when we were In
Estes Park I was Inclined to believe
that It was more than doubtful, but
subsequent Information leads me to
believe that both Governor Carlson and
Mr. Hughes wltl carry tho State.
"Idaho There Is not much doubt
about Idaho being carried by Mr.
Hughes, although I bollevo that tho
vote will bo close.
"Illinois, in my estimation, will be
found In the Republican column. I
have heard It estimated by leaders
who ought to know of conditions In
that Stato that It will give Mr. Hughes
anywhore from 60,000 to 76,000 plural
ity. I think these figures are not ex
aggerated. There is a different angle
to be -taken in Illinois this fall, from
the fact that It will cast more votes
for President on November 7 than any
other Htato In the Union, because
women to the number of at least 00,
000 will vote for the first time for
President This Introduces an element
In tho situation which adds somo un
certainty to the result. I have been
told that some of the women havn un
til recently been Inclined to vote for

BISHOP TURNS TITLE THREE CHARGES ARE

Dr. John W. Hamilton Becomes
Chancellor of he American
University Here.
KINSMAN IN PITTSBURGH
For the first time In the history of
the Methodist Church, a bishop has
exchanged positions and titles with
his brother. Bishop John W. Hamil
ton has been retired as bishop and
made chancellor of the American Uni
versity, and Chancellor Franklin Ham
ilton has been made bishop and sent
to Pittsburgh, where he will be near
enough to Washington to be able to
run over occasionally and assist his
brother In his work.
Dr. John W. Hamilton has taken up
lh residence In Washington and en
tered upon his new duties. Although
entltfed to retire altogether from ac
tive service, he has taken up his
heavy burden gladly.
Poetic Fitness.
There Is a sense of poetic fitness In
Dr. Hamilton's making the chancellor
ship of the American University the
crown of his llfework, for, as It hap
pens, he gave the first dollar toward
the establishment of the university.
He was sccrotary of tho program
committee of the ecumenical confer
ence of Methodists.
One of tho meotlng of the commit
tee was held at Dr. Strong's sanitarium
In Saratoga Springs. During the meet
ing Bishop Hurst, tho chairman, asked
Dr. Hamilton to walk with him to the
Eostoffice. In the moll which the
Ishop received was a great roll of
circular lctlx.r.-. Winn tho bishop o win
ed tho circulars he handed ono of them
to Dr. Hamilton, saying,
"This Is the first call for H0.ono.000
to found a university In Washington,
and as you arc with mo when the let
ters arc received front tho printer, I
will glvo you tho first opportunity to
subscribe."
Dr. Hamilton replied. "The letter Is
too long to read while we walk, and I
will read It on tho train this afternoon
and respond."
Sent Post Card.
When the committee separated Bishop
Hurst returned to Washington and Dr.
Hamilton took the train for the West.
As the latter had promised, he read the
letter, and replied at once on a postal
card as follows.
"Dear Bishop Hurst: Since you were
kind enough to give me tho first oppor
tunity to subscribe t tho fund for the
founding of tho American University, I
herewith subscribes SI. I do this for two
reasons: First, It Is within my means,
and I can pay the subscription. Second,
I want so great an Institution never to
despise the day of small things. And
lost you may think I am trifling, I fur
ther agree to pay the last J100 of tho
J10.000.000."
Tho card was handed to the treasurer
nf the fund. Mntthcw G. Emery, former
mayor of Washington.
Gastritis Factor in

Philadelphia Health Inspector
Blames High Mortality In Dis
ease On Poor Feeding.
BALTIMORE, Oct. 21,-The high mor
tality among infants stricken with In
fantile paralysis tho last summer and
treated at the Philadelphia Hospital for
Contagious Diseases was not caused by
poor nourishment, according to Dr. A.
A. Calms, chief medical Inspector.
"It was oftentimes a combination of
gastritis and Infantile paralysis that
caused the death of Infants,' said Dr.
Calms yesterday, "rather than the mal-
jirlv nlnnn In nrirlltlnn tn thn rilftfflfin
.there was the difficulty of!, nourishing
tno uaby.
"flno nf thn embarrassments that We
arc confronted with now,' said tho medi
cal Inspector, "is tno armiarary man
ner In which parents aro taking tholr
convalescent children from hospitals
whore they are sent for treatment
aftor the contagious stage has been
passed. The hospital management to
.which tho child has been assigned can
do nothing except protest against the
hasty action of tho paront.
"As a result of tho parent taking the
child home with the paralysis still
effective, there Is little chance for tho
victim recovering the use of the limbs
affected."
