has handled the problems growing out
of the European war, and defended the
legislation that averted a great railway
strike, "bringing Industrial peace in a

Mr, Marshall was bitter In his ar
raignment of those who pick flaws in
the president's efforts to maintain
neutrality. "I would rather be a hy
phenated American than an orator i
criticising the president," he cried,
adding that 'if the critics would go to j

London, we would be a more contented
people.
"It is the first right of an American

who hampers the president in time of

spoke at a joint meeting of the

They said that by such action the
great mass of laboring people, "many'
of whom have been estranged, can be
won back to the church."
The Right Rev. Edwin S. Lines,
bishop of Norwalk. N. J., said:
"It's a great mistake to bind the
fortunes of the church with the priv

"There are many men who tell me
they are opposed to so many move

There are some of our clergy, who
during times of great industrial strife
use very strong language. But these

has expressed itself in strong lan

FINISH CAMPAIGN
IN LOS ANGELES I
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 20. Three
days of campaigning in and
around Los Angeles were con
cluded tonight by Mrs. Raymond
Robins of Chicago, and three other
members of the Hughes women's
campaign party and they prepared
to join the soecial train which will
return from Arizona tomorrow, and
start east Monday. Many in the
audience wept today when Mrs.
Rhetta Childe Dorr pleaded at the
Long Beach auditorium for aid for
the "disenfranchised" women of
the east and the assemblage
pledged its support to Mr. Hughes
by a rising vote at the suggestion
of Mayor Wm. T. Lisenby of Long
Beach. Mrs. Dorr told of her ex
perience in sweatshops, laundries,
factories and mills. She declared
that working girls in the east "will
have no country in this land of
freedom until you give us the right
to ballot as you have in the west."

game of golf is expected to be his
chief recreation during his short hol
iday. Tentative plans have been made for
Mr. Hughes to speak in New England
aftep his speech in Brooklyn next
Wednesday night. He then will spend
three or four days here before starting
for Indiana and Ohio.
