Saturday, Oct. 28, has been set
aside as Wilsou Day, to be ob
served by the people of this coun
try as a day upou which they will
pay their respects to the president
of the United States, and show
their appreciation of the great
public service he has rendered his
country. President Wilson is to
send a message to his countrymen
which is to be read in every city,
town and hamlet. Buildings and
homes will display the flag, and a
general recognition will be given
in honor of the man who has
faithfully and patiently guided
tliis nation through perilous times,
and kept us out of war in spite of
the protests of those foreign coun
tries and selfish Americans who
for individual profit desired to see
the United States take up arms in
the European conflict.
Gifford I'inehot, the man who
aided in tying up the vast re
sources of the west so that the
present generations could v;ot
benefit from their development,
is out for Hughes, and it is con
fidentially reported that he will_
be the secretary of the interior
under Hughes if the Wall street
man can succeed in beifag elected.
This would mean a renewal of
the burdensome conditions which
met the west in former republican
administrations, when the east
tried to grab the public landsand
hold them for the benefit of the
entire country, instead of permit
ting the people who settled and
developed the west to enjoy a
small part of the fruits of their
efforts. The Z canyon project in
Pend Oreille county will go glim
mering under such hands, and
Stevens county can take a back
seat again with its wonderful re
sources and water power which
ought to be developed, and which
can be developed under the demo
cratic plans which are supported
by Senator Turner and Congress
man Dill.
Governor Lister spoke before a
crowded house Saturday night, at
the Colville theater, many peopte
standing throughout the speech,
and 20 or more sitting on the
stage. He was introduced by
John B. Slater, who served with
him on the board of control under
the administration of Governor
John R. Rogers.
Governor Lister devoted a short
time to national politics, but spent
the greater part of the hour and
a half iv telling of state matters,
and his work of trying to reduce
expenditures, and build up the
character of the state's many edu
cational, charitable and penal in
stitutions. The latter part of his
remarks were relative to the two
liquor bills which will be voted
at the general election. lie
showed the benefits of the pro«
hibitory law now in force, and
contrasted present conditions with
those* which would ensue should
the brewery and hotel bills be
passed.
The campaign for governor is
1^' ing partly waged over the liquor
question. Governor Lister having
always been on the dry side, and
his opponent being listed with the
wets.
There will be no teachers' in
stitute in Stevens county this year,
the county superintendent "f
schools having pledged that the
teachers of the county shall spend
thc-ir time and money next \vr k
in the great metropolis of Sru
kane in a joint institute with Spo
kane county.
This means-that the fathen and
mothers and those generally in
terested in school work can also
follow the crowd away from home
if they wish to hear any of the
institute speakers or gain any idea
of the work of the institute.
For years the effort of Spokane
has been to get all the money
possible from the outlying terri
tory, and to get all the raeetirigs
A bomb hit the republican
strongholds Tuesday when L. Roy
Slater, former chairman of the
progressive party in this state,
who upon his return from Chicago
advised all progressives to vote
for Chas. E. Hughes, resigned from
both county and state republican
executive committees and an
nounced his allegiance to Wilson.
This action upon the part of Mr.
Slater was due to his disappoint
ment in Hughes, who has fallen
short of his expectation.
;ui(l conventions and land open
ings and everything else to go to
Spokane, thus bringing more
money to the railroads which cen
ter in Spokane, and more revenue
to tlic big stores which pay high
rents on Riverside, and more pa
trouage to the restaurants and
hotels of the city where flowers
and music abound, but where
grub is scarce.
This year Spokane interests
were even able to swing our coun
ty teachers' institute their way,
by promising that the direct cost
to the institute fund would be a
hundred dollars less. With 130
school districts in the county em
ploying 200 teachers who are thus
obliged to go to Spokane for the
week, the Great Northern will be
dble to take in an average of $8.50
per teacher or $700, and the Spo
kane hotels, restaurants, stores,
etc., will be able to get at least
iH.OOO more from the 200 teachers.
Spokane must be given credit
for her cleverness in being able
to work suckers in the outlying
country, but Stevens county busi
ness interests are not showing any
particular amount of acumen m
blowing the county school sys
tem to become the medium or! an
exchange whereby $100 is gained
and $4,700 is lost.
T!i is same matter came up dur
ing the term of Daisy Hard in
about 1908. She demurred at the
plan, Imt as Pend Oreille county
was then a part of Stevens county
and teachers from there all had to
go through Spokane to come to
Golville, she was prevailed upon
to hold the institute ill joint ses
sion with the state association at
Spokane. lint the loss of prestigw
to this county, the lack of any
cohesive work among this county's
teachers, and the aocompanyiuy
expenditure of this county's
money in some other cou.iiy,
taught her the lesson of keeping
home industries at home, and she
then vowed that never again
would this county's institute sro
outside its borders. And through
the remainder of her term, and
through- the terms of her two suc
cessors A. I). Foster and J'iss
Boardman, Stevens county insti
tutes were held in Stevens county.
Pleas were made to the presen*
county superintendent to mai'itam
this county's standing in its in
stitute work, to let the Spokane
Chamber of Commerce build up
Spokane with its own money, and
to permit the people who pay for
the institute to have the institute
where they live. But no result
was obtained, and next week our
teachers will be required to go to
Spokane. It is rather discour
aging for those who have given
the best years of their lives t<>
build up this county, to see its
recognized institutions fall >nto
hands iinappreciative of their
worth to the county, and it se.;ms
that only the most watchful care
on the part of our citizens can
ever hope to maintain the things
which have already been secured.
Several well kmwna »n«-n were
discussing the polities] situation
the other day. when one called
attention to the manner in which
the campaign is being conducted
on behalf of the leaders and the*
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
cniiiiiiittees of the democratic and
republican parties within this
county. He gave it as his opin
ion that after a residence in this
county of over twenty years he
had never observed a political con
test such as at present being
waged freer from the usual abuse
and personalities than the present
and drawing the deadly parallel
between ijhis condition and the
acrimonious debate and acidity
characterised in the so-called non
partisan judiciary contest now
holding the center of the stage, to
the letter's discredit. It goes
without saying that the gentle
man's remarks met with the
hearty approval of all present.
Unless the non-partisan feature
of our ballot in future elections
eliminates the undignified and un
fortunate conditions that have
arisen in the present race for the
judiciary it can not be claimed
to be a success, or taken as a for
ward step over the old style of
placing such candidates on the
ballot under their party designa
tion.
Governor Lister's speech in Col
ville Saturday night revealed the
caliber of the man. He belongs
to the popgun statesmen class.
Even dyed-in-the-wool demo
crats admit that Governor Lister's
speech in Colville last Saturday
night was one of the dullest po
litical speeches they ever bad the
misfortune to hear.
The above editorials appeared in
the Statesman-Index last week.
It is evident that the prohibition
platform of governor Lister does
not please the Index and its
backers, therefore we are not sur
prised to see the Index running
long articles in favor of the wet
candidate Mcßride, and editorial
ly calling attention to the dry
candidate as of the popgun class.
The reduction of the county's
bonded indebtedness $20,000 dur
ing the last two years, and the re
duction of the debt o£ road dis
trict 2 $2*5,482, are features of the
work of 1". 11. Graham as Qpunty
commissioner, and are in them
selves sufficient arguments for his
reelection.
His predecessor, W. \V. Palmer,
who is the candidate opposed to
him ut this election, in hit term
of office 1911-12 spent $40,6ti. r) rood
money, reducing the district in
debtedness $2,22f>, but making no
reduction in the county's bonded
indebtedness. Mr. Graham in his
last two years only spent $2.'J,228,
yet he was able to reduce his dis
trict indebtedness to the amount
of $.'{,(»")!) Sept. 1, and if all taxes
were paid his district would he
out of debt. Besides all this, the
county bonded indebtedness has
been reduced $20,000.
With less money to spend, he
has at the same time reduced the
indebtedness more than any pre
vious county commissioner. He
has kept the road up during this
time, although not nearly as well
as he would have liked, but he has
put his district in a condition
where roads may now be built,
whereas when he took office it
seemed impossible to build any
roads as there was no money in
sight for building.
Sometimes people blame a com
missioner for not building roads
in their locality. In Mr. Gra
ham's term of office, he was able
to accomplish considerable in road
building by securing the coopera
tion of the public, and he has
saved every taxpayer in his dis
trict considerable money yearly
by cutting down the debt. The
sum of $2,400 a year will go a
good ways in building roads, and
that was what this district was
paying in interest alone when Mr.
Graham took office. That sum
will no longer be paid, as the debt
is practically wiped out, and the
man who can accomplish such a
thing and yet hold down the tax
levy, is a man worth retaining in
office.
