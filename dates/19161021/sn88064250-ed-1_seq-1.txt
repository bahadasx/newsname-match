THOMAS IS FOR BOARD
OF AFFAIRS AMENDMENT
GIVES CONCISE EXPLANATION OF THE PROPOSED AMEND
MENTS WHICH WILL BE VOTED ON BY THE PEOPLE
AT riH NOV EMBER ELECTION
To the Editor of The Clarionu
Inasmuch as there is ge.ierally
more or less confusion in the minds
of the public concerning constitu
tional amendments upon a hich they
are called upon to vote, I beliyve a
brief elucidation of each will be
appreciated by the average voter,
that he might not be altoaether in
the dark on these important mat
ters when he comes to cast hiii nal
lot. I believe that every true Lou
isianian desires to vote for what he
honestly believes to be for the
best interest of his state and not
otherwise, and if he makes any !nis
take it is an error of his head and
not his heart.
It is a little unfortunate tiat so
many amendments (eighteen in all'
are to be submitted at the same
time. It is a faulty system, and I
really believe we should never have
more than five propositions sub
mitted it the same time and even
less would be better. A practice
has grown up in the Legislature of
making too much legislation con
stitutional rather than le@'islative,
and every time a change is desired
an amendment becomes necessary.
An example in point is the Confed
erate veteran pension amendment,
which has already been amended at
lepst four different times, whereas,
if only the levying of the tax was
made constitutional and the other
features left to the Gene-vl Assem
bly much needless cost and ex
pense might have been saved. Other
similar cases could be cited.
In the discussion of these amend
ments I shall discuss them as they
will appear on the ballot and not
as they appear in the press or pub
lication.
Amendment No. I.-This is the
amendment- to fund the floating
debt of the city of New Orleans'and
its School Board and to place same
on a cash basis and prohibits fu
ture anticipation of its revenues
Now is a good time to float succh
bonds, when money is pln-'srll. and
as it only affects the city of New
Orleans and is desired by them. I
see no reason why we should not
support the same.
Amendment No. 2.-This extends
the operation of the Juvenile Courts
to the country towns. where"e now
it is confined to the cities. I think
it is a good rm r"n-, and .iuvenili
offenders should not be sent to ft.
Denitentiary, but to the reformal,.
ries instead. and some effort made
td reclaim themu and convert .in -.
into good citizens if possible. That
is one of the essential duties of th
state.
Amendment No. 3.-This amenu
ment is almost self-explanatory.
It authorizes parishes and &e" t
levy special taw' s ..n the vot. of tha
people for certain improveno-nt
not heretofore authorized under
the present Constitution. This ht
special reference to ci'' I ...
a special tax to subsidize a -' ant
boat or barge line and was largety
passed in the interest of Shreveport
and a restoration of navmation on
Red River. No tax, however, could
be levied except on a vote of tue
people, and is limited to ten years.
Amendment No. 4.-This authui
izes the city of Now Orle'vtI o
bridge or tunnel the Mississippi.
river. No one could seriously _.u
Ject to that. I am sure.
Amendment No. 5.-This places
the district attorney of New Or
leans on a salary bacis and abol
ishes feee, and is a larae saving and
does not cost the state any more.
I think the salary ^- ten thou~,ls 1
dollars rather large, but at the
same time it is much less than at
present, and if the amr
should be voted down we would
continue the present "-able
status, hence we had best support
the same.
Amendment No. 6.-This permits
women to serve on the various ed
ucational, correctional and charity
boards of the state and is strongly
subPorted by the good women of
the state. They are certainly com
petent for these places, and this is
a step in the right direction.. Let
us all vote for it.
Amendment No. 7.-This gives
the Confederate veterans all the
money derived from the pension
tax and does not "--" ---- and
authorizes an increase of the same
to $25 per month as the funds be
come available for this purpose. Let
us support it heartily
Amendment No. 8.-This only au
thorizes the city of Shreveport to
fund its floating debt into bonds.
An amendment was necessary on
account of the city having already
voted all the taxes permissible uni
der present laws. No other part of
the state is interested except the
pity of Shreveport,
Amendment No. 9.-This amend
ment amplifies the authority of1
the Legislature in regard . harbor
and other imorovements and was
Dr the benefit of Lake Charles. I
Phere is no special interest therein
as to the other portions of the
state and I see no reasonable objec
tion to the same.
Amendment No. 10.-This amend
ment provides for funding the debt
of the Penitentiary Board to tne
amount of $400,000 at a rate not
exceeding 5 per cent interest. I
l~eve these obligations can now
funded at 4 1-2 Der cent interest,
at par. At the present time Lhe
board is paying from 6 to 8 per
cent on its floating debt, and iji
this amendment is adopted it can
easily save from $10.000 to $12,00
Per year in interest alone. This I
will also put the board on practi- 1
dally a cash basis, where at pres
tat it is paying high prices for i
everything it buys' because it is i
hot able to pay cash for it. The
adooption of this amendment is al
must imperative if the present state I
administration is to be permitted to i
solve the difficulties which it in
erittld from the old board. I do s
most sincerely hope that everyone
y will heartily support this much
s needed amendment. It is certainly
- in the interest of economy and
y sound finance.
a tmendment No. it--This is the
e amendmeent placing officials upon
a salary basis and if defeated by
the people the state and parishes
will continue to pay the exorbi
tant fees that have been so much
complained of in the recent cam
a paign. Governor's administration is
e trying to redeem the pledges made
the people in the campaign and one
of them is that officials be placed
j on a salary basis. An insidious ef
fort may be made in certam quar
ters to defeat this reform, but with
out its adoption the legislation car
rying same into effect falls with it
and you will have no relief for a
long time to come. Do not fail to
vote for Amendment No. ii. Amend
ment abolishing the State Board of
A.vraisement and also the state
f Board of Eaualization and in lieu
th"reof creating the State Board of
Affairs. The cost ,of this new
board will be very little more after
it, is once organized than the two
old boards which are abolished.
This is the amendment which cer
tain special interests political and
otherwise are now sharpening their
knives to kill and are already en
deavoring to becloud the issue and
befuddle the m in ds of
the people in regard to same. By
'he adontion of this amendment and
'he enabling act carrying same in
o) effect the present state adminis
'ration seeks to give the people the
'eform demanded on the subject of
,oualization of taxes. Under the
nresent system the-state- valuation
'or assessment and that of the par
s :hes and cities must be the same.
The effect of this has been that
-ross inequalities exist all over the
ltate in assessments, because in
nome parishes and municipalities
'he local taxes are so high for
"oads. schools, streets and other
omrnoses that if their assessments
wvre put on the basis of other Oar
"shes that have no such high local
'ates it would amount to almost
,onfiscation. Now this amendment
iroooses to unite the valuation of
wroperty for state purposes from
'he valuation for parish and local
iurposes. It does not chance the
:tuation so far as the assessor is
,oncerned in his election or duty
'oward the parish or towns only
eP cannot assess property for less
~an 25 per cent of the value of
he property which is surely low
inugh to satisfy the most penu
'ious "tight wad." In this way it
",e state board proceeds to equal
'o the values in the parishes for
:tfate purposes it will not affect
-'our local assessment in the least
m nr will it increase taxation.
The present status is.. not. dis
turbed. I for one do not believe
we need to raise more taxes on the
neonle for the state government.
If we have the right kind of econ
mvy practiced in our various insti
tutions we can get along satisfae
torilv though perhaps not as ele
rantly and sumptuously as some
iqtnfs that have no bonded debt.
However, equalization can be
be brought about in this way with
out in the least increasing the Ibur
dens upon the people who are :al
ready paying all the taxes they
should. This amendment is ex- a
ceedingly important and should re;.t
ceive your most earnest and patri
otic thought. Some complaint is t
made that this board would have
too much authority. Of course it
has and so has, the police jury, the I
Pitv council, and all other admin-, I
istrative bodies of public affairs.
This board would investigate the t
aetual needs of each state institu- E
tion long before the Legislature i
convenes and fix its appropriations c
upon a business basis or budget so i
to speak, and there will be no log
rolling for appropriations at the
Legislature and no wu eyral appro
priation bill exceeding the revenues.
Demand has been ma,me that we
Place our affairs upon a budget ba
sis and this is the way to do it.
Governor Pleasant is trying to re
deem the pledge made the people
in regard to reforming our assess
ment system and this workable
plan has been submitted for your
thoughtful consideration and should c
receive the endorsement of the peo
ple at the polls. I do not propose to
criticise the motives of those who a
expect to fight this amendment,
but would only ask you to see for
a moment who they are, and how
they stand toward the present a
Democratic administration that is
trying to make good and then draw e
your own conclusions. Do not al
low your minds to become becloud- t
edby prejudiced or unfair and er
roneous statements made by those t
who are seeking to discredit our a
present governor, who is doing his e
utmost to make good in every C
promise made you in the late cam- c
paign. This amendment has no 5
similarity whatever to that pro
nosed in 1912 and does not seek any f
segregation of sources of revenue, 11
as you can readily discern in a
moment. It is in the interest of 3
fair play and correct equalization a
and abolishes two boards with a 5
membership of sixteen. a
Amendment No. 1--This is a lo- a
cal .amendment affecting New Or
leans and provides for erecting a ii
seawall and good road along Lake
Pontchartrain. I can see no rea- F
sonable objection to same, I be- .
lieve it could have been done by a J
legislative act and that the amend- ie
ment was not altogether necessary. C
However, we should support this
improvement.
dmendment No. 14--This is for o
the purpose of compelling all rail
roads to maintain general offices
in this slate. It ought to be adopted s
and there is no valid objection to N
saIre.

Amendment No. 15-This is to au
thorize parishes and cities to vote a
special tax, not exceeding one mill
for fairs and to pay premiums on
agricultural and other exhibits. It
will help out your various parish
fairs which are very profitable and
besides the tax can only be levied
after a vote of the pe9nle thereon
It is all right.
Amendment No. 16--This is a
local amendment affecting New Or
leans placing the judicial expense
fund under the control of the civil
district judges and increasing their
salaries $1000 per annum for doing
this work.
Amendment No. 17-This exempt
sea-going vessels whose domiciles
are in Louisiana from taxation, and
is intended to helep up the mer
chant marine.
Amendment No. 18-This amend
ment permits the railroad commis
sion to compel the railroads to give
free transportation to officers and
employees of the agricultural de
oartment when engaged in their
work. This is not a matter of great
importance one way or the other,
but is to save the state money as
it pays the expenses of such offi
cials and employees when engaged
in the work of demonstration con
cerning agricultural pursuits. I see
no reasonable objection thereto.
I have thus briefly tried to give
a succinct explanation of each of
the foregoing amendments whicjh
will be printed on the ballot to be
voted upon in November next. If
in your own mind you cannot give
a good. sound and sufficient reason
why any one of them should not be
ratified then as a good citizen of
this state and one who has its ma
terial welfare at heart, you should
suovort the same. Do not be mis
led by those who would seek to dis
credit the present Democratic ad
ministration in this state for either
selfish, political or other purposes,
but weigh the merits of the prop
osition submitted and use your own
good sound sense and judgment
and vote accordmingy.
If these amendments are ratified
the administration will be in a po
sition to make further progress
towards redeeming the pledges
made, you prior to the election. I
understand that Amendment No. -ix:
in regard to the abolition of the
Roard of Equalization and Ap
oraisement will be the principal
one attac4ed by the opposition, yet
IHon. Percy Saint and all the Pro
a.gressives in the General Assembly
voted for same and openly stated
that it was one of the best pieces
of progressive legislation offered to
the people. They certainly had no
selfish intereest inmaking such a
statement; but acted as patriots, ao
ing what they honestly believed to
be best for the state of Louisiana.
We should be actuated by like mo
tives and cheerfully support Gov
ernor Pleasant's administration in
its earnest effort to remedy some
of the existing conditions in our
beloved state. Let us stand by him,
L. E. THOMAS.

1SHERIFF HENRY REI IS
CHARGED WITH
.MURDER
CALCASIEU MEN ARRESTED FOL
OWING TO THE KILLING
LEBLEU AT LAKE CHARLES
Lake Charles, La, Oct. 19.-Henry
A. Reid, sheriff of Calcasieu par
ish, and Calvin Harmon, deputy
sheriff, and Dallas Gross, local
business man, were arrested this
morning by Coroner W. L. Fisher
in connection with the killing of
Fred Lebleu on the night of June
28 last. The dArrests were made on
a warrant sworn out by Zepherin
Lebleu. father of the slain man,
which charges Sheriff Reid and
Calvin Harmon with the killing,;
and Dallas Gross with being an
accessory before the fact. The
warrant was sworn before City
Judge W. C. Braden this morning.
District Judge Winston Overton,
Coroner W. L. Fisher, the three
accused men, Attorneys L. H. Moss
and U. A. Bell, who will defend
them. and a court deputy gathered;
in the court room shortly after 11
o'clock. Coroner Fisher was com
missioned by the Judge as active
sheriff, and then served the war
rant on the three men. Their at
torneys immediately applied for a
fpreliminary hearing preparatory to
having them released on bail. The
hearing was fixed for 9 o'clock to
morrow morning.
Three Placed In
Parish Jail
Sheriff Reid and the two men
were then locked up in the parish
jail by Coroner Fisher, who is now
in charge of the- Sheriffs office.
The Calcasieu Grand Jury was to
have convened next Monday ir
special session to investigate the
Lebleu killing. What efiect today's
action will have :'. the sssion is
unkno-.n
Fred I.e.ts:. : .' go:ty - 'rf
and personal friend of Sheriff
Reid, and engaged in driving a
public car, was stabbed to death on
June 28, at 10 o'clock in the even
ing. The killing occurred at the
cornor of Common and Division
streets in the central part of the
city. an almost directly under a
street light.
Although several people were in
the vicinity at the time no clue to
the murderer could be discovered.
Lebleu's dying statement was to
the effect that a "yellow negro did
it" John Doe proceedings were
instituted by the district attorney,
but were abandoned as fruitless af
ter a number of the witnesses had
been heard.
Lebleu Member Of
Prominent Family
Lebleu is a member of a prom
inent family, and it is said that
they have had private detectives at
work on the case since a few days
after the murder. The warrant
sworn out this morni-- does not
disclose the basis of action against
the three men.
Sheriff Reid recently gained
state-wide prominence by the cap
ture of Helaire Carriere, near El
ton a couple of months ago. He
was first elected in 1912, and was
re-elected last January. He is
widely known throughout the state.
C. W. Harmon is one of the office
deputies. Dallas Gross is a well
known local business man, is ac
tive in state politics.
Styles Charges
Outrageously False.
Sheriff Reid, when seen by a re
porter, said that it was not neces
sary for him to make any state
ment at this time. He added, how
ever:
"Fred Lebleu was my intimate
personal and political friend. The
charge against me in connection
with his murder is outrageiusly
false. I have asked for an imme
diate ureliminary hearing' and the
facts will at once be laid against
the public. No frame-up has. ever
succeeded against an innocent man
in Calcasieu parish, and th; one
against me and my friends will be I
torn to shreds when the truthi
comes to light"
Mr. Gross and Mr. Harmon said
that nothing need be added to this
statement and concurred in it.
Mr. Henry Landry was here dur
ing the week shaking hands with
his many friends.
Mr. and Mrs. Geo. Kelt of Beggs
were visitors to our city Sunday.
Mr. Chas. Wilkins, the lumber
inspector. spent Sunday here with
his family.
Mr. Lewis Swords formerly of
this olace now of Ville Platte spent
the day Sunday here with relatives
and friends.
COMMUNICATION
Mr. President and Members of
the Police Jury:
Being a member of the commit
tee submitting the budget of ex
penses for the year 1917 for your
apporoval. I wish to make a few re
marks on the subject. My reasons
for writing this is because I can
write better than I can talk,
hence I have written down a few
thoughts. To begin wi~h i* is the
most unsatisfactory hudePt sub
mitted to this body durine the 12
years I have been a mmbher.
Just think $5000.00 for roads when
we have had $18000.00 and 51854.85
contingent fund when "re have had
$11000.00 and the demands on those
two funds increasing. It is plain
to me, Gentlemen, that something
is wrong: either there have been
mistakes in the management of the
Parish affairs or the taxpayer is at
fault. In my opinion it is both. I
think the Assessors ha"- ' the
mistake of appointing as d r·n'
ward politicians, to take up p s
sessment. A politician may be
ever so honest, but he will he easy
with the voter. This I think has
Saused a considerable fall in the
assessment of improvement and
nersonal nroperty. And - n I
am reliably informed that the own
ers of a large tract of timber in the
north and eastern part of the Par- I
ish have appealed to the. state
board and made representations in
one way or another and have, had
most of their holdings nut down
as stump land when they really
are timbered.
This, Mr. President. could. I
think, be corrected by employine a
timber expert to go - these
lands and if his report showed that
these charges are correct and the
matter was put to the staft hoard
properly certified to, I think we
would have no trouble in retting,
these lands assessed at their full
value. In other words. Gentlemen,
with anything like a fair assess
ment the revenues of the parish
could be increased, well, it is queer,
but I have no doubt, as much as
$15000.00. Now, I happen to know
the incoming Assessor Mr. Andrms
from childhood. He is honest and
capable. and I am sure will make I
aood but I would suggest. Mr. Pres
ident. that you appoint a standing
committee of three to be known as
the committee on assessment, tax
ation and collection of taxes. They
could no doubt give some assistance
to the Asseessor and Tax Collector.
What I have mentioned. Mr.
President. I consider the primary
cause of our trouble. I now come
to the real or immediate cause.
Dredge boat, dipping vats and sev
eral other things that I ,ill not.
mention at this time an the item of
$t5,225.00 annual payment on grav
el roads. Now, Gentlemen. I want
to say right here that I am not op
nosed to gravel roads. I am sure
the time has come when every
town of any size should on ac
count of increased traffic have
eravel on the main roads leading
into them. But let it be done by
local taxpayers. It is impossible
to meet a Bond Issue out of the or
dinary revenues of this or av par
ish without making trouble.
Some of you may have in mind the
large bond issue in the parish of
Calcasieu. That it easy for them.
It is on account of the assessment
on oil and sulphur. It is about as
if this body should buy enough tax
on the court house square to meet
our bond issue and have the rev
enues of this Parish untouched.
Just think $15,225.00 as one year's
payment on the few miles of grav
el road and $5000.00 to assist in the i
working of about 1800 or 1000 miles
and keep .up about 2000 bridges,
why Gentlemen, it don't take a
grown man to see that this is not
only wrong but unfair. Now to this
amount for the gravel you will
add the $4000.00--cancel existing
debts for the gravel is the cause of
that. In justice to the new mem
bers of this b ,dv I war.t to say
that they are not 'espon.i.ible mIr
existing conditions--wet! the best
way to express it is that thy have
inherited them. Well, we have the
gravel and we have to pay for
it. But where we are to tfind the
money to workroad s is the trou
ble. Nearly every ward owes
something or has had work done
thinking they would be able to
nay later and something left to
work roads when in reality they
will have about enough to pay
what they owe and keep fori
bridges-in other words we talk!
good roads but out otp'elvees in a
Dosition where we have no money
to do even ordinary work.
I will admit, Gentlemen, that I.
can see no remedy for our trouble
at this time. In conclusion, Mr.
President. I will say that if any
thing I have said appears in the na
tlre of criticism it is because con
ditions and the occasion justifies.
J. E. DAILEY,
CARRIERE BROUGHT TO
OPELOUSAS FOR TRIAL,
ON MONDAY MORNING, OCT. 23, THE HISTORIC ST. LANDRY
(OURT HOUSE WILL BE THE SCENE OF ANOTER
FAMOUS MU RDER TRIAL
Carriere shot and killed Sher
iff M. L. Swords of St. Lan
dry on Monday, July 17th,
1916, at five o'clock a., m. at
Pot Cove section of the par
ish of St. Landry while re
sisting arrest, and wounded
two negro guides and shot
twice at Sheriff's Chief Dep
uty.
Carriere was shot, wounded
and captured by 'a pose
headed by Sheriff Reid of
Caleasieu, in an old saw mill
near the town of Elton, Jeff
Davis parish, La., on Aug.
17th, 1916, and taken a pris
oner to Lake Charles, La.,
and held there for future or
ders of the courts.
Carriere was brought to Ope
lousas by Sheriff D. M. Fonte
not, assisted by Dr. R. MI Lit
tell, Coroner, Plais Horn, Con
stable and Cary, Deputy
Sheriff and arraigned before
B. H. Pavy, Judge of the 16th
Judicial Distry Court of St.
Landry, La., on October 16th,
1916.
Carriere's attorney, Rosenthal,
moved for a change of venue.
Motion overruled. Exception
filed by defendant's attorney.
Case set for October 23rd for
argument and day of trial.
Carriere served in the peni
tentiary for stealing and was
a fugitive on a charge of
-murder when he killed
Sheriff Swords.
Hilaire Carriere indicted for the
murder of Sherifft M. L. Swords
will soon appear before the courts
of justice to answer for one of the
blackest crimes ever committed in
the parish of St. Landry, th'at is to
say, should a change of venue is
not granted as is pleaded for. Car
riere was brought here from Lake
Charles. La.. where he had been in
carcerated since his capture at the
old Putman Saw Mill near the
town of Elton in the parish of Jeff
Davis a little over two months ago.
Thursday Sheriff Fontenot ac
companied by Coroner. Dr. Littell
and Deputies Horn and Cary
brought Carriere from Lake Charles
to Oeplousas and placed him safely

They wanted to set the man who
had caused so much excitement,
the man who is accused of having
murdered the Sheriff. Long Be
fore the appointed hour of the
noon session those people were
there assembled, and at no time was
there the least sign of excitement,
on the contrary they were peace
ful and undemonstrative in their de
meanor. The disappointed crowd
of the morning was again on hand
in increased numbers in the aftei
noon when the court house bell an
pnounced that the eveniag session
was convened. Those assembled on
the square formed a line along the
short walk leading from the jail to
the court house so as to get a
glimpse of Carriere as he would
pass by. Soon the jail door was
opened and Carriere appeared on
its threshold cleanly shaved and
neatly dressed and unshaken. He
was accompanied on one side by
Coroner Littell and by Deputy Horn
on the other, with Sheriff Fontonot
in the lead while deputy s'0eriffs
followed in the rear. The little
procession quickly passed from the
jail to the court house. The court
room mas soon fil.Id to its full ,a

after Carriere was brouglht inade

but made no' opposition to the de

lion and set the trial for the same
date. To the setting of he date for
trial counsel for the defense filed
an objection, which the court over
ruled. To this Attorney Rosenthal
filed an exception. During all of
these proceedings Carriere appear
ed to be quite at his ease, and
wlancing smilingly friom side to
side seemingly recognizing this or
that one. The prelimineries beinst
over, he was brought back to jail
accompanied by Dr. Littell, Coro
ner. and Deputy Horn and Sheriff
Fontenot where he is to remain
until the 23rd day of October, 1916,
th, day set for trial.
During the return trip to jail
Carriere was somewhat nervous
but on reaching the jail soon re
gained his usual composure and
after the crowd had dispersed and
he had come to old self again,
while reclining on his cot to fully
eretain his lost energy, he became
a little talklative and addressing the
jailer sait that one of the things
hie regretted most in the day's
exper ea¢p was that he was not
:ieriU.d t to "Iget a large

like, to stands on and "let every
one present look at me. so that he.
could go back home and teol his
people that I did not look like the
ferocious lion I was pictured to.
be." Carriere is only 30 yeas old
and when neatly dressed as he was
no one of ordinary kowledge Of
mankind, would ever believe that.
,he was the same Carriere that ther
were looking for in the Mallet woods
some time ago. One would have
been inclined to pass him by. as
one reared in the city rather than
one raised of poor parentage in an
obscure portion of the parish.
When asked if he was sorry to'
have killed Sheriff Swords, he re
plied that :he did not till the Sher
iff, and that he was very sorry
when he was informed that he had
been killed. "But what I do re
gret is that I did not succeed-in.
killing those two negroes that 1
shot at: if I had known that they
were not mortally wounded I would
have doubled the dose. They also

MirW. SOLOMON JACOBS
Died at 5:30 o'clock on Sunday
the 15th. Rosa Lucas, wife of Sol
omon Jacobs, aged 70 years and 2
months.
The death of this most estimable'
lady brought much sorrow to a.
wide circle of friends and acquaint-.
ances. but the blow has fallen with
crushing force on her already-..
strickened husband and tender and
loving sons and dahghters. Nearlty.
all family ties are near and dear,
but one scarcely sees such a pro
found. solicitous and affection re
lation as existed between Mrs. Ja
cobs and her children. "Mother,"
to them, was indeed the most cher
ished word in their vocabulary, and
one had but to observe the proud
light in her kindly eyes when she
looked upon her sons and daughters
to know from whence came the
well springs of her hnoiness. To
her there was no degrese of affec
tion, no slight preference shown to
this son or that daughter, but all
of them stood before her as the
embodiment of her happiness and
ioy. Nor did they ever forget any
kindly deed or affectionate and con
soling words. Her comforts, her
desires, her little pleasures were
what they all strived for, and, now
ever profound their grief, they can
know and feel she passed away in
an atmosphere of filial love and.
tender care.
Her life was one of elf albnega
lion and christian fortitude. and it
is sure her tender spirit has foad
its eternal reesting plaee where
there are no tears, no sorrows. nor
physical pain.
Mr. L. C. Maroney of New Oi
leans attended to business here
Saturday and took in the dIee at
Boscoville Saturday night.
