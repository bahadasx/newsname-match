ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Redskin against paleface will
be the situation in the San Xa
vier marathon Thursday after
noon, October 27, when the fleet
footed Papago and Pima youths
line up against their white com
petitors for the long ten mile
grind on the half mile track at
the Southern Arizona fair.
Jerome reports that within the
last six months the express and
telegraph business of the town
has more than doubled. To ac
commodate the tradtic a new
building is being put up between
the Miller store and the United
Verde Hospital. It will be 20x50
feet, and will house the express
company and the Western Union
Telegraph Company.
The reports which have been
sent in to District headquarters
of the Forest Service for Ariz
ona and New Mexico indicate
that the Forest tire season is
practically closed for this year
in the two states. In ordinary
seasons there is but little danger
of bad Forest fires in the fall of
the year, with the exception of
the extreme northern forests of
New Mexico.
. Plans for the vast amount of
tailings now on the dump below
Hayden are being prepared by
the Ray Consolidated Copper
con pany which owns and oper
ates a 100,000 ton concentrat
ing plant here. The new plant
will have a daily capacity 6,000
tons of tiilings and will employ
bet w en 200 and 300 men. It will
be located on the bank of the
Gila river, close to the tailings
dump, which consists of millions
of tons with a low copper con
tent.
Application has been made to
the State Corporation Commis
sion by the New State Tele
phone and Telegraph Companj'
for permission to dispose of its
property to the Mountain States
Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany. The application will be
heard before the commission, at
Phoenix, Monday, October 16th.
The New State company is a
local system, operating in Co
chise county, with central office
at Dragoon. D. A. Adams is
president of the company. Ben
son Signal.
Unprecedented prices of mohair
are being received by Yavapai
goat raisers at the present time.
Shipping early in September
from Kirkland valley, at a price
of 38 cents per pound, the high
est ever paid. Consignments
total over 60,000 pounds from
two localities of this county, of
the season's clip, and which next
year it is stated will be swelled
to over 75,000 pounds. The
healthy outlook of the industry
is reflected in many new invest
ors coming, as well are old-time
goat men enlarging their hold
ings. Arizona has no local facilities
for marketing or manufacturing
livestock products. It happens
that fully five times as much
hog products are consumed in
the state as are produced here.
On the ther band, more sneep
and cattle are produced in the
state than are consumed. Thus
it is shown that we should at
lpast have market facilities for
collecting, killing and preparing
the animal products lor rnarKet
locally to supply the products
used at home. - At the present
time very few of the towns or
cities use local meats but ship
them in from eastern markets.
Governor Hunt returned from
a tour of the north on Tuesday
to attend to official business. He
will be one of the principal
speakers at the big rally in
Phoenix Saturday evening in
which all state candidates will
participate. Everywhere
throughout the north were big
crowds to meet the democratic
candidates and were well receiv
ed. The governor is popular
throughout the entire state and
manv truesses are made that he
will carry every county. Some
people believe Campbell has a
slight chance to carry two
counties. Pima and Yavapai.
TICKET WELL BALANCED.
Arizona democrats present a
state ticket that is well balanced,
every one on the list being pe
culiarly fitted for the position to
which he aspires.
Senator Ashurstand Congress
man Hayden have been both
able and vigilant; they have
been faithful and will be even
better equipped because of ser
vice when they begin their next
term of office. They know how
and they do their work well.
Henry D. Ross, who runs as a
non-partisan has done such good
service that he will be returned
without question.
Gov. Hunt, head of the state
ticket Is a big number on the
platform. His policies generally
are approved, while his honesty,
and conscientiousness is never
doubted, even by those who op
pose his policies.
Sidney P. Osborn has given
an excellent business adminis
tration of the office of secretary
of state.
David F. Johnson is so thor
oughly qualified for the office of
treasurer, being an unusually
good accountant, that his selec
tion was a fortunate one. The
treasurer has so much to do with
loaning money of the state, and
Mr. Johnson is thoroughly fam
iliar with land values.
Jesse L. Boyce, the jolly, good
natured candidate for auditor,
has all the necessary business
qalifications.
For tax commissioner, Chas.
R. Howe is an ideal man, an ex
pert accountant, a heavy taxpay
er and one who feels a real in
terest and keen responsibility in
discharge of his official duties.
He possesses every qualification
necessary in the highest degree.
Amos. A. Betts. who is at pre
sent rate expert is thoroughly
qualified for the office of cor per
foration commissioner, having
had many years of ripe ex
perience in that line.
Prof. C. O. Case has brought
the schools of the state to such
high degree of efficiency that it
would be to the injury of the ser
vice to make a change. The su
perintendent of schools acts in
dual capacity; being member of
the board of pardons and par
oles, with which work he is also
familiar.
G. H. Bolin, present state
mine inspector has given good
satisfaction, and affairs of his
office are kept up-to date.
It will be seen by going over
the entire ticket that the people
made no mistake in primaries.
It is now only necessary to
ratify their choice at the polls in
November, and this the people
will do without doubt. The
Messenger.
-Trees Killed By Poisoned Mash.
Mr. W. E. L'Hame, of Cochise
Arizona, writes the following in
regard to the use of poisoned
mash for destroying grasshop
pers: I will relate to you my
experience with hoppers in my
orchard this year, as it may
prove valuable to some other
farmer in the future. When
fighting the hoppers I placed
around every tree poisoned bran
mash about every other day.
So in the course of time quite a
bit accumulated around each
As soon as the rainy season be
gan the hoppers let up and my
orchard made a new start. After
a few days, however my trees
began to die. A close examina
tion showed that the rain water
dissolved the poison and kill
ed the bark where the trunk
meets the earth. As long as the
weather continued dry the poison
was inactive, and it should have
been removed before the rains
came. I lost nearly 90 per cent
of my tress, but I hope it will
help some on else from similar
mistakes."
Save the Nation From Prosperity.
Mr. Parker the vice presiden
tial nominee for the progressive
party says:
"My unanimous, unsolicited
nomination meant nothing to
those men, whose action on June
23 showed they belonged body
and soul to the republican ma
chine, and had forgotten pro
gressive principles, which were
to J.hem a temporary dream.
They first deserted the repub
lican party, damned the 'Old
Guard' for every conceivable
crime, pledged their honor and
loyalty to progressive principles,
and then deserted and betrayed
the progressive party, and hav
ing again locked arms with the
same Old Guard republicans,
they so bitterly denounced four
years ago, now have the auda
city to appear before the people
of the United States in the role
of patriots, endeavoring to save
the nation.
"To save it from what?
"To save it from the prosper
ity which is so rampant from
New York to California?
"To save it from the farmers
who are making large crops, for
which they are realizing more
satisfactory prices than ever
before in their history?
"To sa.ve it from the working
men whose brain and brawn is
needed in every state in the
Union, and who are receiving
more money than ever before in
their experience with shorter
hours of labor?
"To 'save the country' to them
means to fleece it for their per
sonal, political and financial gain.
"Such brazen hypocricy from
such men who must be judged
by their past record cannot de
ceived the American people."
STATE FAIR NEWS NOTES.
Great will be the harness races
at the Arizona State Fair to be
held at Phoenix November 12th
to 18th. Double the number of
entries have been received for
the different events than were
received last year, and while it
was almost impossible to fill
some of last year's races, it
seems this year as if there will
be an overplus of entries.
It is not only in horse racing
that greater interest is being
shown. The automobile enthu
siasts of Texas, New Mexico
and Arizona are responding joy
ously to the call for the Tri
State races, and some speedy
'boats' are being stripped and
tuned up for the track as well as
the road race from Douglas to
Phoenix.
The farmers in the Salt River
Valley are taking greater in
terest in this year's fair than
ever before, and the different
counties of the state are laboring
mightily to secure representa
tions that will entitle them to
prices for the best county ex
hibit. From many different portions
of the state have come requests
for entry blanks of the Woman's
Department, and the ladies will
certainly be represented.
Cowpunchers from as far
north as Montana and from the
most southern portions of Texas
are writing to ask for informa
tion and signifying their inten
tion of entering the cowboy
sports.
Cattle and sheep men are ap
plying for stalls and pens and
already new stalls are being
erected to take care of the excess
over last year.

WAGER HOLDS GOOD RECOORO.
Victor J. Wager, who is otifc
on the Democratic ticket for re
election to the office of county
assessor has the distinction of
being the only assessor in the
state in whose assessments no
changes were made by the State
Tax Commission in the year
1915, and in 1916 only a few
minor changes were made. At
the annual state conference of
supervisors and "assessors, held
at Prescott for the past two
years and attended by represent
atives from Santa Cruz as well
as from other counties in the
state, the different county as
sessments are gone over with
painstaking detail, and upon the
recommendation of this body the
State Tax Commission changes
the assessments of the counties
where they are found to be in
correct, and after the meeting of
this state tax conference usually
many changes are made in the
levies of the different county as
sessors. But so very fair to all
interests were the assessments
of Santa Cruz county that no
changes were made. Vic is very
thorough in his work, and that
the people of Santa Cruz county
appreciate him will be shown at
the coming election. Patago

Board of Trade, which met at
Prescott Tuesday, September

Chamber of Commerce. Andrew
Kimball, vice president of the
board and chairman of the State
Horticultural Commission, de
clared that the display of pre
served fruits and vegetables
was one of the finest he had
ever seen, and proved beyond
doubt that Yavapi is destined to
become a great agricultural, as
well as mining district. Yava
