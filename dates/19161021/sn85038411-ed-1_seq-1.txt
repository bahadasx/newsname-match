Loan Demonstration
HARRY A. BOYER
j Marshal of High Student Parade.
i School Director Harry A. Boyer will
ibo chief marshal of the big high
| school loan parade of November 4.
J One of the spectacular features of
i the campaign organized to puq
, through the $1,250,000 loan to provide
for better high school facilities, is to
i lie the great marching demonstration
;of the 1,500 odd students of Central
i and Technical high schools.
; Through the co-operation of Cap
j tain H. M. Stine, Uncle Sam's regular
army recruiting officer here, the hun
j dreds of students are being drilled
i daily at Central high by youthful mili
i tary instructors who have volunteered
! their services.
Old School Days
Monday Technical high school be
| gins its program of training under the
i tutelage of ex-Troop Sergeant J. Grant
| Koons. For a week the boys will get
I instruction In marching in the school
"gym"; the following week they'll be
drilled in the streets.
| All that was needed was the selec
j tion of the proper head for the par
' ade —and the committee has picked
I Mr. Boyer to marshal the youthful
| forces.
The former president of the school
! board amazed an admiring city a. lit
tle more than a year ago during Har
risburg's three-day municipal im
provement celebration by organizing
some 11,000 of the city's school chll-.
dren in the most colorful and interest-'
| ing spectacle of the kind ever ar
! ranged in Pennsylvania. And it wast
| the passing of the hundreds of small
! youngsters, incidentally, that suggest
| e<l the idea of driving home to admir
| ing papas—and mammas—the Impor
j tance of carrying the proposed loan
; for a new high school.
Select Aids in Few Days
Mr. Boyer will select his staff of aids
! within a day or two.
By Wednesday of next week Arthur
D. Bacon, who has charge of the Ito
| tarian end of the campaign activities
will be ready to announce the list of
i volunteer Rotarian poolworkers who
will I e on the job electioneering for
I the passage of the loan at the polls.
| Mr. Bacon said to-day that he is
awaiting the literature that has been
promised by the committee before se

United States Legally
in State of War
With Mexico Is Rule
Washington. D. C„ Oct. 21. —Prest-
dent Wilson and Secretary of War
i Baker, according to information forth
coming from the War Department, arc
I much incensed over the fact that
! I'rigadier-Oeneral Enoch 11. Crowder,
! judge advocate-general of the army,
holds that the United States is legally
lin a state of war with Mexico. Gen"-
! era I Crowder says that the invasion
•of Mexico is a condition and not a
theory.
This decision from the highest legal
source on matters pertaining to mili
tary operations has been rendered by
General Crowder to keep the record
straight and to cover the legal pro
cedure involved in all incidents grow
ing out of the so-called Mexican cam
paign. The judge advocate-general's
office found that the refusal to admit
that a state of war exists led to such
legal absurdities that light on tile real
status was essential.
The resentment of the adminis
tration over this decision is due par
ticularly to the fact that it has reached
the public. It was carefully suppressed
for days and not intended for publi
cation at present. It is admitted it
weakens the plea "he kept us out of
war."
One unpleasant effect which State
Department officials fear in view of
General Crowder's expose is the
strengthening of Carranza's demand
tlia: the "state of war" be eliminated
by withdrawal of tlie American troops.

hours as they. If any were to have
the short day I believe all should
have it."

say that he had urged and voted for
an amendment to the Adamson bill
providing that it be made to include
every man in the transportation ser

eight hours to any but trainmen he
