A
Popular Congressman Also Put Up a
Good Argument for Success of
the Democratic Party
Mr. Frank Clark, representative In
Congress from the second Florida
district, had a good audience when he
spoke from the bandstand on the pub
lic square Friday night.
Mr. Clark had been almost con
stantly at work in Washington during
the entire life of this Congress, and
when it adjourned a few weeks ago
was immediately called on to do cam
paign work in the north. Consequent
ly he was wearied and his voice was
somewhat strained and husky, but he
made a ringing good speech, just the
same.;... V ''.V , :- '.-"V
Most of his speech was given to na
tional politics and the real work done
in Congress. He spoke of the con
structive legislation of the party, the
tariff . revision downward, currency
reform, rural credits, good roads,
preparedness and other things that
the democrats have, done under this
administration and impressed on his
audience that the country was now
going forward and couldn't afford to
turn back. -. ; ' .
Speaking of hisown personal cam
paign, Mr. Clark paid his respects to
his opponents Gober and Ctoffin. He
was easy with the former, ' who has
observed political ethics, but the
dressing down and tearing up he gave
the . Coffins made people sorry for
them. V;' '-: . v,:' '- -'
He spoke of the scurrilous circular
sent out by the Coffins against him,
and which the Star has already ex
plained. He showed where some of it
was ridiculous and all of it either false
or distorted. He read an affidavit
from the clerk of Duval county crimi
nal court to the : effect that Geo. W.
Russell, described by the circular as
being an habitual criminal had not in
twenty-eight years previous to the
complaint against which Mr. Clark
helped defend him, had any indict
ment or even .- complaint brought
against him in said court. He turned
the tables on old man Coffin by read
ing an affidavit from the clerk of the
federal court in Jacksonville showing
that Mr. Coffin had been indicted for
embezzlement of funds while post
master at Johnstown, had pled guilty
and been fined $1250. The Star un
derstands that Mr. Coffin's offense in
this matter was technical, he had no
intention of wrong doing, and made
good" the amount, but as there was
considerably more evidence against
him ; than he brought against Mr.
Clark, he need not complain if the
matter is raked up against him.
In the matter of prohibition, Mr.
Clark declared" he Jiad always, as citi
zen, legislator and congressman, vot
ed dry. He paid a beautiful tribute
to American womanhood, and said he
thought a woman's place was more in
the home than in politics.
Mr. Clark received close attention
and frequent applause. At the close
of his speech he met and greeted
many personal friends in the audience.

vices to the state committee to work

CAMPAIGN FOR MEMBERS
The Woman's Missionary Society of
the Methodist Episcopal church,
South, has adopted as its slogan every
woman and young person in the
church a member of the missionary
society. We think that as we assume
the vow to support the institutions of
the church, that means Sunday school,
mission societies and , leagues.
The Florida conference set apart
the week in October beginning with
the 23rd as the time for a whirlwind
campaign in this conference. Mrs.
Hood, president of the Ocala auxil
iary, has appointed two women ' in
each ward to visit every woman in
the church anid invite her to "heepme
a member of this society. It is to be
hoped none will refuse to join these
earnest workers in the-Master's kingdom.--'.
