OLD WAR
British "Tank" Is One of Long
Lino of Queer Devices.
Wooden Horse of Troy, Hldo-Covcrc
Towers Used by Alexander In
Siege of Tyre and Caesar's
Javelins with Iron Points.
Tho British "tank," described ns c
car of death resembling u pondorouu
slow-moving steel caterpillar, Is or.
of u large fuullly ot Btrnngo unglnes ol
destruction sired by the God of Wur,
says u bulletin of tho National Geo
graphic, iitfeiety, P.evlewlujj' the hl
tory CiTrfurt- niribug civilized na
tions, one of the earliest engines oi
destruction whoso fume hus been per
petuated on the pages of legendary
epic wns tho great wooden horse which
the crufty Ulysses left on tho plulns ol
Ilium, nnd which the Trojans believed
to be an offering sacred to the goddess
Atlietin. Counseled by the false Sinon,
tho Trojans razed their wnll.s In order
that tho "gift" of tho Greeks might be
brought into the city. After nightfall
the warriors hidden inside tho wooden
nnlmul crept out, threw open the gates
of tho city uud admitted their compan
ions, thus bringing about the destruc
tion of tho city of Priam nnd wreaking
vengeance upon tho people who had
sheltered Paris and the fair but false
Helen of Troy.
An engine of war which emerges
from tho cloud of legend and tukos its
place among historical uctualltles wns
tlint employed by Alexander tho Great
in his seven-months siege of tho fa
mous Phoenician metropolis, Tyre. This
(indent city was strongly situated on
nn Island nnd us there were no long
rnngo cntapults In the fourth century
before the Christian era, Alexander
conceived the plan of building ti mole
or causeway from the mainland to thji
Island. This engineering enterprise
was hampered by the Tyrlnns, who
launched blazing ships against the ns
snllants ns they sunk piles to hold In
placo tho rock nnd debris that formed
n roadway over which the army wns
to march. In order to protect his con
struction corps Alexnnder devised
great towers covered with green hides.
These were set up ns shields ngalnst
the floating flames of tho enemy, nnd
the result wns one of the memorable
victories In Alexnnder's conquest of
the eastern world.
Ono of the simplest nnd yet , one of
tho most effective Inventions ot tin
cleut times wns tho Javelin with n
point of soft iron employed by Julius
Cnesnr in one of his Gnlllc wars. Tho
Itomnn legionaries hurled these weap
ons ngalnst tho shields of their ene
mies. The Iron head penetrated tho
outer covering of bull's hide, but flat
tened out ngnlnst tho hardwood or
metul buck of the shield, and thus be
came hooked to this protector. Tho
shanks of the dangling Javelins so im
peded the movements of the barbarian
soldiers that they were forced either
to throw nwny their shields nnd light
uncovered ngalnst the Romans or else
stop long enough (a fatal delay lu their
advance) to disencumber themselves
from this unique weapon which may
properly be culled the dum-dum pllum,
the progenitor of tho soft-nose or dum-
,dum bullet of today.
Perhaps the strangest engines of
destruction in tho history of tho world
were tho seven trumpets of rnm's horn
which tho priests of Israel blew us
they encompassed the walls of Jericho
once each day for six successive days
and seven times on the seventh day.
After tho Ann) blast the hosts of Isrenl
guvo n grent shout nnd tho walls fell
flat, according to tho Biblical account
in tho Book of Joshua. Those who en
deavor to explain nil miracles on tho
theory that they are tho result of ex
traordinary implications of the natural
law have seen In this rcmurktihlo incut
a demonstration of tho vast destruc
tive pdwer of sympntlletlc vibration
tho same principle which has been
known to shako to its very foundation
n great bridge of steel and concrete
when a dog trots across it.
Another nrms oddity of Biblical In
terest wns the ruse employed by
Gideon, leader of only 300 Israelites,
who successfully engaged a vast host
of Mldlnnites and Amnlckltes thnl "Iny
along In tho valley like grasshoppers
fnr multitude; and their camels wero
without number, ns the sand by tho
seaside for multitude." Gideon's en
gines of destruction wero BOO trumpets,
!10O empty pitchers nnd U00 lamps with
in the pitchers. As the enemy's enmp
wns approached during tho night the
pitchers wero smashed, tho lamps held
aloft In the left hand, while terrifying
hlats from tho 1100 trumpets spreml
consternation nnd terror among tho
rleepers who In darkness Imagined that
they hnd been attacked by a great
army. Tho result was wholesale
slaughter among themselves whllo the.
followers of Gideon wntched.
Eskimo Lamps.
It Is believed that the Eskimo lump

emigrated from their original home,
which wus probably further south nml

tho lnmp becomes more specialized tho
