City Council Transacts. Much Important
Business at Its Meeting Gives Land
for Government Armor Plant.
At tho city council meeting on Mon
day tho "wet" clement demonstrated
Its strength by placing on fllo two "re
form" measures that had bcon Intro
duccd by tho drys sovornl months ago.
Ono was the Protzol ordinance pro
hlbltlng dancing whero drinks are sold
and tho other was Aid. Cnpltoln's res
olution directing the mayor to rotuso
to Irbuo liquor licenses for tho terri
tory in tho four mllo limit surrounding
Northwestern University. Tho voto to
fllo In each Instance was 40 yeas to
22 nays.
Aid. Block, Cross, Tyden and Van
derbilt presented an order directing
tho harbors commltteo to considor ten
dering tho federal government a frco
slto on Calumet lako for tho erection
of a government armor plant.
Dy obtaining tho suspension of tho
rules Aid. Otto Kcrnor succeeded in
having passed an order directing Chief
Hoaloy to lssuo boforo Oct. 2&cortlfl
cates of approval to flvo manufactur
ers of auto truck fendors who havo
compiled with ordtnanco specifica
tions. On motion of Chairman Capltaln of
tho transportation commltteo the
council passed ordinances for three
street car extensions: Thirty-first
Btroot from Kedzle avenuo to Craw
ford avonuo; Forty-Bovcnth street
from Kcdzia to Archer avenue, and
Eighteenth street from Leavltt strcot
to Western avenuo.
Mayor Thompson submitted tho ap
pointment of August Scholtz for tho
position of Randolph street market
master.
After listening to brief statements
concerning labor difficulties in connec
tion with tho Union station and Penn
sylvania, freight terminal, tho city
council commltteo on rnllwny termi
nals determined to keep its hands out
of tho tanglo for tho present.
Tho commltteo recently was author
ized by tho city council to endeavor
to adjust tho differences between tho
contractors nnd their employes, but on
motion of Aid. W. J. Hoaly tho nldor
men voted to ask tho railroad Inter
ests to confer with tho union In an
effort to euro tho troublo at tho earli
est possible dato.
There was somo inclination toward
tho appointment of a subcommlttoo to
attempt mediation, but after tho rail
road officials present said they had
littlo knowledge ot tho cnuso of tho
troublo Aid. Hoaly and others contend
ed tho council should not intervene un
til after tho companies havo tried to
adjust tho difficulties.
E. A. Howard represented tho Bur
lington linos, A. M. Schoyor tho Penn
sylvania, and E. D. Sowoll tho Chi
cago, Milwaukee and St. Paul. Simon
O'Donnoll, president of tho Building
Trades' council, spoko for tho unions.
"This strlko was called," said
O'Donnoll, "because ot a violation of
an agreement between tho Construc
tion Employers' association and tho
Building Trades' council whereby it
was agreed that in all construction
work carried on in Chicago and Cook
county nothing but union labor would
bo employed.
"That agreement nppllos not only to
tho terminal building but to tho con
tributing branchos of tho construction
outside of tho city."
Mr. Howord, Mr. Schoyor and Mr.
Sowoll said this was tho first timo
thoy had heard of such an agreement.
Thoy Bald the unions had not laid their'
griovanco betoro them and agreed to
attempt to mako a satisfactory adjust
ment ns soon as possible.
THE PEOPLE

Tho overbearing insolence of somo
of tho offlco holders in tho City Hall
and County Building calls attention to
tho fact that an Office Holding Aris
tocracy is rapidly growing into perma
nent control of our publlo affaire.
Among our officials thero are some
honorable exceptions some men who
feel that they are In offlco to serve
the people.
But thero are others and their
number is Increasing who imagine
FOUNDED 1889

PeepU f Influence and Standing
that the only thing tho average citizen
Is good for Is to vote.
Party allegiance is forgotten when
they are sworn in and tho Jobs go
to relatives, regardless of party or fit
ness. Tho Offlco Holding Aristocracy has
no uso for tho voter after ho has used
him.
Herbert Kaufman paid his respects
to theso follows when ho called atten
tion to their treatment ot tho publlo
In thoso words:
"You consider yourself an Important
porson because your position occasion
ally permits you to annoy people. But
so can a gnat, a rusty hinge, a rattling
window and other minor bothers.
"Impudence is a Smart-alock's con
ception of impresslvencss a back
stairs notion of 'big folks" bohavior.
An upstart betrays himself by tho
mannor he displays his authority.
"Thoso who aron't accustomed to
the uso of power Invariably abuse It.
"Insolence Is the snarl of tho insig
nificant 'big head' ovidenco of a
small one.
"You merely show up whon you
show off. Wo all know Just about
what your Job pays and theroforo how
much Intelligence It demands so why
bluff?
"Office boys, bell hops and cosh
girls may possibly mtstako your im
pertinence as a manifestation of su
periority, but tho public recognizes
tho ass In tho 111 fitting lion's skin.
"Headquarters always hears the
creak in tho machine and soon locates
tho source of tho troublo."
Tho voters of Chicago may bo fools

But tho voters of Chicago aro not

And whon thoy wako up, somo of

ROBERT E. WILSON
Robort E. Wilson, tho ablo Domo
cratlo representative from tho Sixth
Senatorial District, was tho fathor of
tho Firemen's pension act so far as
the legislature goos. Ho fought for
It and stood by It until It becamo a
law. This Is only ono ot a hundred
good laws placed on tho statuto books
through tho Instrumentality ot Robort
E. Wilson. Votors of tho Sixth Dis

PROTECTTHECHILDREN
Mora children havo boon killed in
eighteen months In tho dlstilcts
whero factorlos, homes and shops aro
all Jumbled up than in nil othor parts
ot Chicago togothor. This fact ap
pears in a statomont presontod to a
commltteo composed ot Aldermen Mc
Cormlck, Buck, Wnlkor and Wornor
by Aid. Merrlam showing why tho
city council should bo authorized by
tho legislature to crcato building dis
tricts or zones, as provided In a bill
ho introduced last May tor recom
mendation by tho council to tho next
gonoral assembly.
"Many streots In tho congested
neighborhoods ot our city nro usod as
playgrounds for tho children," says
Aid. Morrlam's statomont. "This is
especially true In tho Immedlato vi
cinity of a publlo school. Tho coming
ot business establishments and fac
tories into such neighborhoods In
variably brings moro and heavier vo
hlclos and increases tho dangor to tho
children from accidents.
"Tho numbor ot children killed
whllo playing on Chicago streots Is
appalling. If wo aro to mako our
streets safo for our children nnd re
duce tho number of littlo ones who
meet death on tho public thorough
fares of Chicago, wo must segregato
our factories and our shops nnd our
stores nnd keep them nway from our
homes. Business nnd Industrial neigh
borhoods must bo kept sopnrnto from
residential districts.
"In addition to a much desired re
duction In deaths and injuries to chil
li ron and grown pcoplo, tho creation
of business, factory and homo zones
would bring about othor important
benefits. It will protect ngalnst de
preciation of property values both tho
homo owner and tho investor. It
would matorlaly lessen fire hazards
and bring smaller Insurnnco rates. It
would add to tho enjoyment of our
homo llfo by ridding tho places whero
wo live of tho nuisances of clouds of
smoko bolchlng from fnctorlcs next
door, accompanied by tho rattling and
clanking of machinery and tho befoul
ing of tho air by foul gases. With a
general Improvement of homo condi
tions will come also a moro economi
cal and orderly industrial develop
ment of Chicago."
