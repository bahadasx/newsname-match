GROUP OF STATES
N"HECTIC MOOD"
Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and
Missouri Not Yet Politically "
Crvstallized.
"MYSTERY" IN WISCONSIN
BY N. 0. MESSENGER.
CHICAGO, October 21.?Ohio, Indiana.
Illinois and Missouri are at this time
?n a condition where political opinion
has not crystallised. The best that the
prudent political observer should do is
to describe conditions from day to day
until It becomes apparent which way
the pendulum is swinging, before the
stroke of the hour.
In The Star correspondent's first dispatch
from Chicago on this trip it was
stated that the pendulum was swing- i
ing to Wilson. That was true, and it
continued to be that way. For a fortnight
there has been nothing but surface
news indicating democratic
brightening prospects. And yet republican
managers know of apparently
stable conditions favoring their side of
tl\e political controversy which would
offset these disturbing surface outcroppings,
to their minds and in their
judgment, at least. So the neutral
fc*riters here who keep in touch with
both managements have had to withhftl.l
iurl w m n t rpaliiinp- thp trntH ctf
on the warpath, there is no way to tell
how It will crystallize.
Surface Indications in Wisconsin.
Wisconsin sends down democratic
surface indications, while inside republican
reports show a trend toward
the democratic indications and being
told of the existence of conditions prorepublican
which would seemingly offset
their effect.
Drift Toward Wilson in Ohio.
These dispatches Elated ten days ago
the drift toward Wilson in Ohio. It was
due in the main to the labor vote in
the northern cities of the state, which
have become industrially populous and
highly prosperous in making war munitions.
Moreover, as stated, the newspapers
of the region are prodemocratic
in the main. If the election in Ohio
were to be decided by the northern
counties, Wilson would carry the state.
But neutral observers are told by republican
managers that there are other
factors to be taken into consideration.
There is the tremendous latent normal
republican plurality to-be taken into
account, 85,000 votes. There is the vote
of the farmers, who have the other side
of the eight-hour wage law question
that is settin gthe labor world on Are
and there is the vote of the Germans in
Hamilton and Franklin counties (Cincinnati
and Columbus).
One of the contributing reasons for:
republican slacking down in Ohio is
known to be the feud between rival
republican factions aspiring to control.
That has led to lessening efficiency:
of management, but that difficulty is
now being ironed out.
In Ohio, therefore, while outward in- j
dications appear to point to democratic
<anrl whil* let nnilniiKtorflv
a tremendous sentiment for President
Wilson, a careful person will not at
this time predict the state going democratic
on the national ticket.
Now, there Is a thumbnail sketch of I
the situation in Ohio. I might write
(wo columns and give no more adequate
idea of it.
Prospects in Indiana.
In Indiana the outlook has not
changed since the last -report which
was to the effect that republican effective
management has apparently assured
the state for Hughes, except that
there again come In these reports indicating
democratic gains. There is
talk of the Germans beginning to
switch to Wilson, as I found in St.
l.outs this week and also is found in
Wisconsin.
But to offset that condition is reported
a growing unrest among labor men as
the republicans continue an elucidation
of the eight-hour law. They are not all
satisfied with the law?not even ail the
railroad men. President Wilson's visit
to Indiana this week gave the democratic
hopes a boost and now the republicans
will have to busy themselves
to offset that.
i/emocranc trains in Illinois.
In Illinois the democrats have been
gaining for two weeks, as reported In
The Star's correspondence from here.
The visit of President Wilson to Chicago
yesterday gave tremendous impetus
to the democratic campaign. He
was given a splendid reception and
stirred up remarkable enthusiasm. At
democratic headquarters today the
managers are in a fever of optimism
over the prospect to them of carrying
Illinois. A month ago they would have
thought it impossible and merely figured
on the size of the prospective republican
plurality. Now they think it
may be done.
At republican headquarters today we
are told of campaign plans among the
women down the state, among the
farmers and among the laboring men
which are of a character to warrant
expectations of a great bracing up of
the latent republican vote. This state is
normally republican by a heavy
plurality .
One of the reports disturbing the republican
managers is that in this and
that community republicans are going
to vote ior wnson on tne war immunity
claim. The republicans are
setting after that theory in many
ways to dispel it from tho minds of
men and women, and believe they can
be in part successful in the days intervening
before election.
In this effort they have an important
adjunct in the republican press of the
state, which is influential and with
wide circulation. Thus, in Ohio the
democrats "have the edge" with the
newspapers, and in Illinois the republicans.
An "Unknown Quantity."
I have written so much upon the unknown
quantity of the woman's vote
that it would seem almost superfluous
to touch upon it again. It is assumed
that they are all going in a flock on
the sentimental grounds of the alleged
war immunity, but indications based
upon practical reports show that they
are riot. The registration in Chicago
shows heavily in favor of the republicans.
and a campaign is being waged
down state to try to get every republican
farmers wife and daughter to
the polls.
The foreign vote in Chicago will cut
a heavy figure in the result. There is
110 question that among the races other
than German descent President Wilson
is strong in favor.
Missouri was described to you briefly,
but. to the point, early this week, the
fact being that the state is still in the
melting pot, with two weeks in which
to simmer. All depends upon which
way t*ie German vote will turn on election
day. and with Col. Roosevelt still
stabilizing:. La Follette's following is
much of a mystery in connection with |
the presidential vote, but the republic- i
nns are trying to hold all the I-a Follette
men In line. There are reports of
Germans going over to Wilson. Then
there are also reports of much talk
among the railroad men over the eighthour
law. the employes outside of the
four brotherhoods being jealous and
unrestful.
The upshot of all these reports, surface
indications and actual conditons, is
that in Ohio, Illinois. Indiana, Missouri
and Wisconsin the campaign is
not over, and it is too early to put any
state out of its normal place.
The people are in an excited condition.
Passion runs high, while race
prejudice and religious intolerance cut
a iarge figure. The liquor question is
involved. The whole group of states is
in a hectic mood, politically.

STOP MILK STRIKE,
PLEATOOFFICIALS
Citizens Think Commissioners
Should Take Steps to
Safeguard Supply.
iiiiiit Turn ta urni ft TT
f WAN I intlVI IU IVItUIAIC
| The District Commissioners should act
to prevent a milk strike, which would
i cut off the milk supply of Washington,
j and which has been threatened by milk
I producers who ship milk to the Dis|
trict, in the opinion of citizens of the
; capital. They contend that it would be
unwise to permit the struggle between
Lthe milk producers in Maryland and
Virginia and the milk dealers in Washington
td reach such a stage that it
' would bring about a milk strike.
None of the District Commissioners
was in Washington today, and their
views on the matter were not obtainable.
Commissioner Newman is not
expected to return to Washington for
several days. Commissioners Brownlow
and Kutz were,at Occoquan-on a
tour of inspection.
The suggestion was made today that
in the event the District Commissioners
were unable for any reason to
undertake to bring about an adjustment
in the milk fight they appoint an
impartial committee of business men
to attempt an adjustment.
On the one hand the milk producers,
farmers and dairymen in
Maryland and Virginia contend .that
they cannot continue selling milk to
the dealers in Washington at the existing
prices and make a living profit.
On the other hand, the milk dealers
not afford to pay the producers more
for their milk without receiving more
for the milk that they retail to the
consumers here.
Neither side cares to. advocate at this
stage an increase in the price of milk
charged the consumer, it is said.
The question arises, also, should
there be a concerted effort on the part
of the producers and dealers to increase
the price of milk to consumers in the
District whether the Department of
Justice might not step in if a plea is
made that the anti-trust law is being
violated.
Proposal for Mediation.
E. C. Brandenburg, president of the
Board of Trade, expressed the opinion
that if the producers and dealers were
willing to have their contentions submitted
to a board, whether the District
Commissioners or an impartial board
of business men, the situation might
be relieved. He pointed out that on
the showing made so fa?* the producers
are not making a profit on their milk
owing to increases in prices of feed
and labor and that the milk dealers apparently
are paying as much as they
can for the milk which they retail here
and make a reasonable profit. An investigation
of the whole matter by an
impartial board might bring out the
whole truth in these matters.
He suggested that if it vw shown
that the milk producers could not continue
to produce milk at existing prices
and that the dealers were only making
a reasonable profit from the milk distributed
here, the consumers would
have to pay more for their milk if the
milk supply is to be maintained.*
P. T. Moran, president of the Chamber
of Commerce, said he thought the
difficulties between the producers and j
the dealers would be adjusted soon, J
and that it probably would not be necessary
to have the matter referred to
the District Commissioners or any
other board for adjustment. He said
there was no doubt that the farmers
who produce milk for consumption
in Washington are now paying far
more for their "raw materials" than
they did in the past. He said that cottonseed
meal, which is fed the cows,
now brings $42 a ton and that it used
to be $15 a ton. Bran, he said, was
selling at $32 a ton instead of $20. as
formerly. Cornmeal, used for feeding
! cows, he said, was selling at 97 cents
a bushel, when it used to sell for about
50 cents.
Troubles of Distributers.
Mr. Moran pointed out also that the
distributers of milk in Washington
have hau their expenses Increased owing
to the increase in the cost of feed
for their horses; and labor, he said, was
higher today.
"It may be that It will be necessary
that an increase in the price of milk
charged consumers must follow until
the abnormal conditions due to the European
war and the tremendous exports
of foodstuffs to Europe have ceased to
exist.
The executive committee of the Maryland
and Virginia Milk Producers' Association
is to meet again Monday, October
30. At that time reports will be
received frdm the organizers sent out
to get the 1,400 farmers./and dairymen
who produce milk for consumption here
into the organization. The executive
committee is counseling "no strike if
avoidable."
The opinion was expressed Here today
that neither the producers nor the dis-|
tributers would object to having the
whole matter thrashed out in the presence
of an impartial board before a milk strike
was called by the producers, or before
an increase in the price of milk to
the consumers was ordered by the distributers.
A complaint that associations of
farmers, dairymen and dealers in milk
i in Pittsburgh are violating the anti[
trust laws was filed with the Depart!
ment of Justice yesterday by James F.
I Burke, a former member of Congress,
i There was no evidence accompanying
I the complaint and no statement was
I made by the department as to what
: steps would be taken to investigate.
"The department has nothing to say,"
it was stated. j

DENIAL THAT MEXICAN
CHANGES ARE TO BE MADE
r
Ambassador Designate Arredondo
Says He Is Not to Be
Believed Here.
From all sources of official information
on Mexican affairs at the State
Department and Mexican embassy 11
was asserted authoritatively today that
no proposed changes in the personnel
of the Mexican commission or in the
ambassadorship to the United State?
were known or in contemplation.
Elesio Arredondo, ambassador designate.
authorized a denial of reports
from Mexico City that Gen. Pablo Gonzales
would relieve Luis Mabrera, head
of the Mexican commission, or that he
was to be succeeded by Mr. Cabrera
"I nave just returned from a conference
with Gen. Carranza," Mr. Arredondo
said, "and am in a position to know
the status of Mexican affairs in the
United States. There have been no intimations
of such a change and I do not
expect any."
Dispatches from Franklin K. Lane,
chairman of the American conferees ol
the commission, received today at th?
State Department, failed to mention
any such change. Neither has any inquiry
concerning the acceptability ol
Mr. Cabrera as ambassador to this
country or suggesting Mr. Gonzales as
successor for Mr. Cabrera been received
by the department from Mexicc
City.

G. P.O. HEAD FAVORS
SATURDAY RESPITE
Public Printer Believes Em:
pioyes Should Have the HalfLI
ii.cj n-:. *i
t noijaay rrivnege.
i
CorneJius Ford, public printer, has
. joined the ranks of government officials
i who are declaredly in favor of making
. the Saturday half holiday for federal
[ employes a year-round institution.
> Mr. Ford said today that he intends
to add his recommendation on this subject
to the series of letters in favor of
the continued Saturday half holiday that
the President has been receiving from
cabinet members.
As the government printing office carries
on its rolls more than 4,000 em;
ployes, with upward of 3,900 in actual
service, and is one of the largest departments
in the government service as
concerns the number of persons employed,
Mr. Ford's support is welcomed
as a powerful influence by American
Federation of Labor officials and others
interested in this movement. ?
"I am decidedly in favor of granting
' the Saturday half holiday all the year
round," said Mr. Ford today. "I always
have been in favor of granting such
> rest and recreation time to employes
I who perform faithful service. I believe
> J that greater efficiency can be attained
; in this way. I expect to set my views
along this line before the President at
the earliest possible occasion."
Mr. Ford holds, however, that an increased
appropriation will be necessary
if the Saturday half holiday is granted.
He says that the increased expense at
the government printing office would
be something like $235,000 or $240,000.
"Nevertheless," said Mr. Ford, "I am in
I favor of the increased appropriation
and.giving the employes the half day
off."
j*avorea in war department.
Reports favorable to the granting of
the^ half holiday have been made to
the Secretary of War by seven of his
bureau heads, following the lead yesI
terday' of Adjutant General McCain.
| The reports today were from Inspector
i Gen. Garlington, Judge Advocate
General Crowder, Quartermaster General
Sharpe, Acting Surgeon General
Birmingham; Gen. Black, chief of engineers;
Gen. Mclntyre, chief of the
insular bureau, and Gen. Scriven, chief
signal officer.
It is understood that Chief Clerk
Schofleld will add his favorable report
within a few days.
All of the reports will be laid before
Secretary Baker upon his return Wednesday.
With such reports before him
it i& believed that the Secretary will
make a favorable- report to the President
on the proposition.
Secretary Daniels Favorable.
Another cabinet officer, Secretary
Daniels, it is understood, has given his
approval to the all-year-round Saturday
half holiday for government employes.
Admiral Benson, chief of the
naval bureau of operations and acting
1 Secretary of the Navy, said today that
I he understood the Secretary had given
his approval to the all-year Saturday
half holiday w.efore he left Washington
1 With this approval, there are only
tnree more caomtsi uuiuers 10 act on
I the proposition. They are Secretary
Baker. Postmaster General Burleson
and Secretary Bane of the Interior Department.

Description of Battle. i]
The British correspondent Rives the
'ollowing description of Thursday's
tattle: ^
"The day's fighting befcan at 8 o'clock f
n the morning. Artillery, infantry, and
avalry all played their parts with un- .
isual faithfulness to the old traditions,
.'elyeselo was in Serbian hands by noon,
nd although this was as much as the n
taff had honed to' attain by the whole fl
iperation, the Serbians kept on. The
apture of Brod followed immediately,
nd by night the new Serbian line in- rr
luded Gardilovo also, with the cavalry ci
till further in front.
"At the beginning of the day's fightng
every advantage rested with the Bui- ei
Marians. They held the higher line be- f<
ond the river with slopes so steep that sj
hey could roll rocks down on the atackers.
There was a two-hour artil- tl
ery preparation ffbm 8 to 10 o'clock, a
["hen suddenly a great cheer went up, ri
.nd at 1Q the Serbian infantry began d
heir advance. They could be recognized o
rom a great distance, as every man had b
. big square of white calico fastened ir
o the back of his blue coat, and the si
eading men carried white and red flags p
irith which to mark the farthest point t<
eached. so that the artillery could see r<
nd avoid shelling them. s<
"While the Serbian infantry advanced
ip one crest the artillery began poundng
the crest just beyond, and soon little !
rhite flags began to mark the Serbian i
an carried forward to that point. Then tl
he cheering broke out with redoubled t]
orce, as far beyond the white flags the _
bservers cotild see dark figures running w
ast down hill. They were Bulgars in tl

OWER ALLOTMENT
FOR DISTRICT GUARD
Var Department Apportions
Funds Only for Men Not on
the Border.
PROVISION OF ARMY ACT
The presence of the National Guard
f the District of Columbia on the Mexran
border is responsible for a great
eduction in the amount of money aportioned
to the brigade by the War
epartment for the expense of provldig
arms, stores, equipage and other
quipment for the organization.
Because of a paragraph In the army
Borganization act authorizing: the apropriation
of such sums for National
iuard equipment, the National Guard
f the District of Columbia is figured
ow as having just seventy-nine ensted
men. On the basis of this flgurig
the militia bureau has issued cfrular
No. 14, which states that the toll
allotment for arming, equipping and
raining the District National Guard
or this year will be $3,010.71.
The total allotment for the seventyine
enlisted men in the National
ruard of the District of Columbia uner
the heading "arms, uniforms, equiplent.
for field service" is $2,434.78. The
otal federal allotment for the National
iuard of the District of Columbia for
his present fiscal year is the sum of
hese two items, $5,445.49.
Same Rule Applied to States.
Other states have been allotted money
or training and equipage in the same
lanner, and those states that were
uick to recruit their forces to war
trength and swear the men into the
"nited States servic* get the least
loney.
At first glance it appears that this
llotment turns out to be a premium
n a poor showing at the time the
'resident ordered out the guard. For
nstance, Hawaii, whose National Guard
s estimated at 4,811 men, did not send
ts troops to the Mexican border and
rill receive an allotment for arms,
quipmqnt. etc., amounting to nearly
162,000. New Mexico doesn't get a
ent, its men presumably all being iti
he service of the United States and not
n the service of the state.
A * . 1 Ill.l- U-* ?
i?c "innm uurtrau touay ii was
aid that the terms of the army rerganization
act were complied with to
tie letter.
"The act states that the money for
tiese purposes must be apportioned to
tie National Guard in proportion to the;
nlisted strength of the guard on the
ate of the passage of the appropriation
ct. On August 29? when the army apropriation
act became effective, there
rere seventy-nine men in the National
luard of the District of Columbia not
n the United States service."
Say New Deal Is Possible.
War Department officials were asked
rhat would occur when the men return
rom the border.
"It is possible that a new deal will
are to be made."
This was taken to mean that supplelentary
legislation will be asked for
trough the committees on military afairs
in Congress, 'but the President
lay indicate what is to be done in the
ase of the District of Columbia.
The armsr reorganization act provides
ir the continuance of the regular fedral
allotments to the National Guard
>r camp stores, equipage, etc., and
ays. in addition:
"The annropriation provided for in
lis section shall be apportioned
mong the several states and territoies
under just and equitable proceufe.
to be prescribed by the Secretary
f War and in direct ratio to the numer
of enlisted men in active service
1 the National Guard existing" in such
tates and territories at the date of aportionment
of said' appropriation, and
i the District of Columbia under such
emulations as the President may precribe."
Total of 28,169 Not in Service.
The War Department circular'shows
hat there are 28,169 enlisted men of
he National Guard in the United
tates who have not been called into
he service of the United States. There
re twenty-three states, mostly west
nd south, in which the entire National
uard was in the federal service at
he time the allotment was made.
New York receives the highest allot lent.
Its share is $497,185 for 7,541
nlisted men. Iowa, with twenty-seven
alisted men not in the federal serv:e.
received the lowest allotment, its
>tal being $3,886.
