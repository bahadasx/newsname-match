Funeral '-Services to Re Held
" This Afternoon; Remains

iS-y. y V '. ,V:.,
LATE DR. W. L. MOORE -
Dr. Wijliam h. Moore, prominent
rnd well-known Honolulu physician
and a resident cf the islands for about
30 years died at 4: ?,0 o'clock this
morning at the XJueen's hospital fol-l'-wing
a lengthy illness. : v.
The remains have been rehioved to
WilHams' undprtaking. elabfishmnt
and. th"te funeral' "services, were to be
held at 5 o'clock this aftemooa at
St. Andrew's cathedral Emma street,
with Rev. Caaon William Ault offi
ciating. The remains vill be cremat
ed and private interment will be in the
Nuuanu cemetery. The local lpdges of
Elks and Masons were to attend the
tuneral. ; c ';
Doctor Moore's death resulted from
poisoning due to the treatment by him
cf a case of iryslpelas. Immediate
relatives surviving are a widow and
three daughters, Alice, Caroline, and
Eloise.
Dr. William L. .Mocr.e was born in
Michigan in 1863, attended the public
schools and from the high school en
tered the University . of Michigan,
where he graduated in medicine in
18C0. He was then appointed instruc'
tor in medicine at that institution,
serving for three years. His change
of residence to Honolulu is mentioned
in I'rominent Men or Hawaii, or
Sheba's "Who's Who?" as follows:
"While many others who came to
visit Hawaii and. became infatuated
with the islands finally joined - the
'come back club,' and made their per
manent residence here, the experience
of .Dr. William L. Moore, now. one' of
the leading practitioners of the city.
is somewhat different from the gen
eral procedure, for when he arrived
in Honolulu on leave of absence . from
the University of Michigan 19 years
ago, he was immediately so well pleas
ed that he remained here ever since."
(This was written four years ago.')
Besides casting bis lot with Hawaii,
Dr. Moore also chose his life-partner
here. This was Miss Lowrey, sister
of Frederick. J. Lowrey, president of
Lewers fc Cooke, Ltd.
In addition to building up a large
private practise as a physician and
surgeon. Dr. Moore took a keen' inter
est in the public health, serving for a
time as a member of the board of
health, also as assistant city, and coun
ty physician, commissioner of insanity
and visiting physician to the Queen's
hospital. At the time of his death, he
was a member of the. board for exam
ing candidates for license to practise
medicine and surgery. He was for
years connected with the national
guard. of Hawaii, in which he ranked
as major-surgeon. Dr. Moore was a
thirty-second degree mason. Being of
most likable disposition hU circle "';of
friends was hounded only by .the list
cf his acquaintances.
