A Farm Woman To
Women Of The Farm
From the lips of Mrs. W. A. Warner,
who is a farm wife and mother her
self, came these brief epigrammatic
sayings, expressing the farm woman's j
viewpoint, in a striking address de-
livered before the delegates of the In- j
ternational Farm coneress Saturday I
morning: ', f
t
"The United States government ap- !
propriates more money for the study J
of hogs than it does for children." j
-Ice automobile is doing more to
emancipate the women of the farm
than any other invention of the ages."
"Woman's masterpiece, like God's,
is man. Until woman live under per
fect conditions, man never can be per
fect-" 1
"Land wes never worth hree cents
an acre, until some woman came and
made'a home on it." i
"Ken make the laws from their !
awn viewpoint. When men know the I
right thi-g to do, more men will do
the right thing for women."
"I have known men to become j
fathers riding to town on a load of
wheat. They don't count the cost of '
becoming fathers." !
"Women produce nations. Men de- j I
stroy them."
"Woman is the unpaid servant of j
the nation."
"The dty has skimmed the intel- j
lectual cream from the country, and j
is feeding it to the one-third of our ,
children in the dty schools." j
"The outlook lor the farm woman i
never was so promising as today." I

consul with the assistance of troops.

It is assumed the action of the French
legation was for the purpose of safe
guarding the French concession, though
advices in that regard are not clear.
Forcible retention or the land, as well
as the manner of its acquisition, are
expected to be a matter of complaint

! SAYS ROOSEVELT
Has "Kissed the Hand Red
With Blood of Americans,"
the Colonel Declares.
Phoenix, Ariz.. Oct. 21. Speaking In
this border state today before a sym
pathetic audience, Theodore Roosevelt
declared that president Wilson has
"kissed tbe hand that was red with
blood of American men and women."
He accused the president of direct and
abject cowardice toward Mexico. That
country, he said, might become for us
what the turbulent Balkans have been
for Europe the Inevitable cause of a
great armed conflict.
Feared Others: Not IT. S.
Mexico feared England. Germany.
Japan and France, he continued and
except in a handful of instances, has
respected the lives and property of their
citizens.
She neither feared or respected the
United States, China or Spain and she
murdered tbe nations of these three
nations by hundreds.
When the Englishman Benton, was
killed, he said, not merely did England
flame up. but far more interest was
excited in this country thsu was shown
over all of our own men. women and
children who were killed in Mexico.
Tbe I. O. U. Convention.
Mr. Roosevelt dubbed the Atlantic
City conference over .Mexico the "L O.
LT. convention." By this, he said, the
president is trying to prop and bolster
up the tottering structure of Carran
za's government.
But as soon as Carranza became
strong, he concluded he would turn
against the United States. Wilson di
plomacy would be paid for by this
country in the bloodshed, suffering and
disaster of war.
Wilson's Indictment Mont Severe.
CoL Roosevelt said Ihe most stinging
indletment or Mexico was written by
the president himself in a note to the
Mexican government, delivered through
the secretary or state June 20 In which
was presented a complete and shocking
resume or Mexican barbarities in Mex
ico, in many of which Americans were
the victims.
