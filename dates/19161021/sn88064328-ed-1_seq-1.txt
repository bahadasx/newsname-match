Washington, I >. C. (From Our
Special Correspondent.) A mil
lion farmers, probably mort 1 , rafli

"What do we have to <|o, and
when mav we beurin, to organize
a loeal Farm Loan Association?"
I am now prepared to answer
those questions. with a reosonahle
degree of eertainty, for the ben

to date the authorities here have
been somewhat non-eominittal on
the first nitestion. and it is prob
