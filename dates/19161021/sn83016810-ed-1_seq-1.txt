or of such other state as the legisla
ture may by law from time to time di
rect. All swamp lands now held by

the proceeds of said principal shall be
appropriated to the common school

sale of school and swamp .lands,
to be used in constructing roads,
ditches and fire breaks in, through
and around unsold school and
swamp lands and in clearing such
lands, such fund to be replenished
as long as needed from the en
hanced value realized from the sale
of such lands so benefited."
.Under Section Two as it now stands
tne proceeds of the sale of school and
Bwamp lands constitute the principal

IH used for the support of the schools,
educational and charitable institutions
of the state. Section fw as It now
Dtands provides that the principal of

Inviolate and undiminished."
THE EFFECT of the proposed
amendment, If adopted, will be to mod
ify the provision Jpst quoted to the
extent of permitting the legislature to
et aside not to exceed 9250.000 of the
principal of the trust fund as a revolv
ing fund to be used for the purposes
tated In the amendment proposed.

village of this state, but no such in
vestment shall be made until approved
by the board of commissioners desig
nated by law to regulate the- invest-
ment of the permanent school fund and
the permanent university fund of this
state nor shall such loan or invest
ment be made whe# the bonds to
belows!
Issued or purchased would make the

If the proposed amendment Is adopt
ed It will then read as follows!
"The permanent school and uni
versity fund of this state may be
invested in the bonds of any coun
ty, school district, city, town or
village of this state, and in first
mortgage loans secured upon im
proved and cultivated farm lands

THE PURPOSE of the amendment
to authorise the investment of the per
manent school and university funds in
"first mortgage loans secured upon Im
proved and cultivated farm lands
where the amount of the loans so se
cured does not exceed 30 per cent of
the value of the land mortgaged.
THE EFFECT of the adoption of the
proposed amendment will be to permit
the legislature to authorise the In
vestment of the pernii^Bfnt school and
anlverslty funds In farm mortgages as
Shove stated, as well as In the bonds
f any county, school district, city,
town or village of this state. Under

PROPOSED AMENDMENT NO. S.
By Chapter 381, Laws 1916, the legisl
ature proposed for adoption by the
lectors, an amendment of Article Nine
9) of the Constitution by adding
hereto a new section, which reads as
ollows:
"Section 17.t legislature Is
hereby authorized to provide by

and for. that, purpose mav nrovlde
for the drainasre of any such lake
or river, or the diversion of the
waters thereof to a new bed or
channel, provided, however, that

the same officers and upon the
same terms as is, or from time to
time hereafter may be authorized
oy the constitution and laws, for
the or investment of the
Pundloaninge
ermanent school and university
of th state."
THE PURPOSE of the proposed
intendment cannot be more clearly
tated than Is expressed therein.
THE EFFECT of the amendment, If
Bdopted, would be to confer power on
the- legislature- to-provide by law for
the mining of iron ore and other min
erals, which the state owns in its sov
ereign capacity and situate under the
bed of any meandered public lake or
river, subject to the restriction that
the rights of riparian owners on any
uch lake or river, shall not be de
Itroyed or injured without compensa
tion. If the legislature exercises the
power, in case it is conferred, it could
also provide for the drainage or dl
rerslon of the waters of the lake or
river with reference to which It so
legislates i It could also prescribe by
whom such minerals could be mined
nnd the compensation to be paid to the
utate, therefor. The proceeds of the
ale of any such minerals would con
stitute a fund to be loaned and Invest
ed the same as the permanent school
nd university funds, the income of
uch fund to be used In the construc
tion, Improvement and maintenance of
public roads.
PROPOSED AMENDMENT NO. 4,

PURPOSE AND EFFECTi Under
the Constitution as It now Is, the gov
ernor may veto any Item in an appro
priation bill, but he cannot cut down

the W houses, each by a two-thirds

THE PURPOSE AND EFFECT 1

(a) It will permit the voters to pro*
pose amendments to the state constitu
tion, for adoption, without action hy
the legislature. Under the constitution
as it now stands constitutional amend
ments can be proposed only by the leg
islature.
(b) So, too. If adopted, the amend
ment will permit electors to propose
laws for enactment and if not enacted
by the legislatures, the voters may by
sufficient petition, require the question
of the enactment of the proposed law
to be submitted to the voters. If ap
proved by a majority of the electors
voting, thereon, provided the vote In.
favor of the proposed law to not less
than thirty-three per cent of the totnl
number of votes cast at such election,
the same becomes a law with the same'
force and effect as though passed by
the legislature. The governor will
have no power to veto a law so passed,
but the people cannot ao pass any. law
which to prohibited by the con.The
Btitutlon.
So too, if adopted, the amend
ment will permit the voters by propel
petition to require a vote on the qucs.
tion of whether or not any law or pari
thereof, of certain classes of laws,
passed by the legislature shall be re
pealed. If the petition asking for th
referendum to signed by fifteen pel
cent of the voters "of the state, the num
ber of whom to to be determined bj
the number of votes cast for Governoi
t the preceding election, the laws
referred to the voters will not tak
effect pending the referendum vot
thereon. The vote required to repeal
law passed by the legislature and tlu
classes of laws which cannot be soagencies
repealed are specified in Subdivision
"C" of the proposed amendment at
above printed.

lowing: Owing to the alarming spread
of Jim-crowism we declare an oppo
sition to the whole policy of race
separation in public and semi-public
institutions, in places open to the pub

We seek nothing but justice, and

of the other groups in this country,
because of race.
Against Reactionary Movement.
We denounce the segregation of
Colored employees in the civil service
of the Federal government as un
American, unjust, a wicked, shameful
and disgraceful abuse of power.
We denounce the spirit of those so
called representatives of the people
in the halls of Congress, who are con
stantly seeking to deeitizenize the
Colored race by the introduction of re
actionary legislation which belongs to
a past age and which the great body
of the American people have outgrown.
Racial Organization, Opposing Segre
gation.
We call upon the leaders of our race
in every section of our country to
unselfishly guide the people through
the difllculties by which they are be
set, and to organize them locally and
nationally to resist and combat denial
of civil and political rights and es
pecially the policy of separation from
fellow Americans of every race in the
life, opposing segregation, the
perpetrator of race prejudice.
Those who have wisdom let their
counsel be heard. Those who have
wealth, let them assist materially
where the need is great. Those who
have courage, let them stand and con
tend for justice.
