days from date of policy. Hereafter,

Lake Charles, La., Oct. 19.—Hav
com e by boat over some of the
■ bayous and waterways of the pro
p0S ed into-coastal canal system that
: w ill j 0 j n West Louisiana with New
; Orleans in trade, the first party of
\ e w Orleans delegates to the meet
ing of the Interstate Inland Water
way League of Louisiana and Texas
reached here today aboard the laun
ches Destrehan and Louisiana. Both
boats draw three feet of water. The
boats followed the Morgan City
Lake Charles route, but as construc
, tion is necessary to open the Morgan
City-New Orleans links they were
able to come through only a part of
these waters.
Representatives of this city met
the party on the Calcasieu river on
the launch Winona, Commodore
Robert Leake in command at about
2 o'clock. After handshaking and
greetings, the boats headed for Lake
! Charles and arrived after an hour's
trip.
Aboard the Destrehan, which is
owned by Captain Horace Harvey,
and the Louisiana, the Conservation
Commission's launch, were the fol
lowing: A. M. Lockett of New Or
leans, representing Mayor Behrman
and Governor Pleasant; A. M. Du
pont of Houma, representing the
trades and industrials of Terrebonne
■parish; Wilbur H. Kramer of Frank
lin, representing the commercial ac
tivities of St. Mary parish; W. S.
Holmes, superintendent of the game
department of Conservation Com
mission and a staff representative of
The Times-Picayune. It was intend
ed to have a larger party to make
the trip, but business engagements
prevented some New Orleans boost
ers from attending.
Captain Harvey and Mr. Lockett
left New Orleans Sunday morning
through Harvey's canal, Bayous
Barataria, Williard, Lake Salvador,
Harvey's canal, Number Two and
Bayou Black, and reached Houma
Monday morning, where Mr. Du
pont and the reporter joined them.
The route led through Bayous B'ack,
Chene and Boeuf, to Morgc.t City
where Mr. Kramer was waiting.
Tuesday the Destrehan pointed
her nose down the Atchafalaya river
to the gulf, went through Shell Is
land pass into the Atchafalaya bay,
through Morrison's cut-off, where
the cr< ss urr< nt a : ea-sickness
