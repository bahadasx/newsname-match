SCHOOL BOARD PROCEEDINGS.
Continued fro m last week.
UUonunuea iro
At your last special meeting you
asked me to give you today a state
ment of what part of the amount
budgeted by you for teachers salaries
and operating school transfers had
been apportioned for this coming
year, I therefore offer the following:
Budgeted for white sal
aries ......... 22384.00
Contracted for by me be
fore last meeting ... 22241.60
Balance not contracted
for before last meet. 142.40
Last meeting you authorized the
following additions to the teaching
force:
2 teachers for Slidell.. ° 500.00
2 teachers for Covington 500.00
1 teacher for Fo:som .. 250.00
Extra for 5 teachers .. 1250.00
In other words you have ordered
contracts with white teachers to the
amount of a salary for five months
of $1107.60 over and above the
amount budgeted by you.
As to the amount for operating
school transfers I offer the follow
ing:
Amount allowed by the budget for
operating school transfers $1450.00.
At present you have contract for:
Sun transfer with E. E. Talley,
442.50.
If the Folsom transfer costs $40;
Edwards and Koepp transfer costs
$100.00, this will make a total of all
of the transfers of $912.50, for a
term of five months. This will leave
a balance of $537.50 not expended
or contracted for. `'his will be
$107.50 for ne month.
However, I wish to call your at
- tention to the fact that should you
not decide to operate any transfers
this year you will still have a short-1
age of $570.10 when we consider the
two items of white taechers and op

,;LISSON DAMAGE SUIT
SET FOR TRIAL FRIDAY
Empanelment of Petit Jurors
Discharged Until Meeting
of Court To-day.
District Court convened Wednes
day, Judge Carter on the bench and
iksurict Attorney Brock prosecutting.
Two cases to come up at this Iteram
attracted considerable attention, the
Btste vs. E. D. Kentzel and the Gl(s
so ndamage suit. The Kentzel case
tilled the courtroom to overlowing,
and sympathy seemed to be largess
in favor of the defendant. It was
generally conceded that sir. Kenltze.
would be acqu.itted of the charge o,
embezzling parisrh funds. The charg
es on which the various counts in the
indictment are based are too famitliar
to the public and too long Ito re
state, but ilhe count on waiclh the
eost was made was the misapproprta
rion of $ o.00, It being claimed :tha,
a warrant for that sum had been is
sued twice to Coroner bsudloch ant
,ahit Dr. Bulloch collected one eeu
.ir. Keni3zel the other, and' taVt oune
.ne had been received by :Dr. Bul
.ooh. Mr. Kentzel etated on urn

ii. D. Bulloch or bearer and hi
received five ,ve-dollar bl~is wihic.

tan.ring in front of ,the courthouse.
rte saih he did this because Dr. Bul
ioch had telephoned him ehalt he (D1r.
Isulloch) would not be in Covington
until after the banks were closed.
Mr. Kentzel was ably defended by,
B. M. Mitler, Judge Thu.s. M. Burns
and Arthur L. Bear. T'he jury was
out .but ten minutes or so when it
returned a verdict of not guilty.
Petit jury panel discharged un

Steamer Josie.
Beginning next week the steamer
Joele will leave New Orleans every
Wednesday at I p. m., arriving at
Oovington Thursday morning.
Freight will be received at the Cov
ington whatf on Saturday for Ne'w
Orleans and way points.
This change in schedule has been
made on account of the merchants of
Covington desiring their goods here
for the week end.
The Josie has Just had her engine
and boiler overhauled and expects to
make her trips in mcia better time
than heretofore.
erating school transfers.
Since our last regular meeting the
new school building at Talisheek has
been burned down and you have au
thorized the advertisement for bids
to build a four-room house in the
place of the one lost. These bids
will be opened by your building com
mittee on the 10th of October. One
very good reason for building a four
room instead of a three-room house
there is the fact that at the end of
the first month this year we had an
enrollment of 110 pupils and there is
no doubt but that a three-room house
would be outgrown in another year
or two.
The Mandeville school wap opened
on Monday of this week by a special
arrangement being made regarding
the board of the teachers.
As I look over the list of teach
ers engaged for the year I am glad
to report that we have followed our
custom of employing home teachers
who are competentt and hold valid
certificates. I notice that out of 79
white teachers we have 42 whose
homes are in St. Tammany parish.
I make this statement because of the
fact that reports have been circulat
ed to the contrary. I am free to
state, however, that I would not
agree to employing a teacher .who
lives in this parish if this was the
only claim she had to such a position.
The contractor for the painting of
the Savannah Branch and Progress
school houses has not yet had' his
work accepted, and I would be glad
Ito have your board give your presi
dent and secretary any instructions
in this matter you may think best.
I am expecting that the new Pro
gress, school will open just as soon
as the painting is completed and the
furniture ineta'ied. I expect thati
the new teacherage is already com
pleted, and I would auggest that it
IMadam Paviowa at Parkview, Sunday, 22d
Ti I
F "
THE DUMB GIRL OF PORTICI.
One of the greatest events In the
history of the r ction picture art will
take place at Parkview Theatre on
Sunday, October 22, when Russia's
ancer, Anna Pavows, will appear on
the screen in a passive spectacle en
titled "The ·Dum.b Oinl of Portici."
Although the stage stars are ca
pitulating to the. motion pioture
screen almost daily, one may not
name one celebrity who has so far
been enticed from the speaking stage
who is in a class with Anna Pavlowa.
None of the famous singers, such as
Geraldine Farrar, can bring to the
screen all of their gifts, such as gave
them fame. The voice of the dive
cannot be heard in a motion picture
be insured at once or as soon as the
new, furniture is installed in the
school.
Work on the new 'Madisonville
school house.is progressing very nice
ly and the contractor says that it
should be completed by the first of
November. The School Improvement
League there has had a fine flowing
well put down and I feel they should
receive a vote of thanks from this
board for. their great interest in
school matters.
Mr. David B. Smith, of Lewisburg,
has asked me to place before you to
day his.request for an appropriation
of about $12.00 dollars.
As the Robert school closed last
year with only one teacher, I opened
it this year wl'h but one. The at
tendance has gone up to the point
where it was at the opening of last
year, and even beyond that; there
fore, I have sent them a second for
the balance of the session. I expect
to have the plans for the new Ridge
school house so that I may start the
advertisement for bids in next week's
issue of the paper. Probably the ad
vertisement will also include bids for
the new proposed Sand Hill school
to be built in the first ward.
Although you approved of an ex
tra teacher at the Ramsay school at
your last meeting, I have not yet
thought it advisable to give it. Upo:n
my visit there I found that only 26
children had enrolled for four grades
which number I did not consider was
too much for the present teacher. I
was told that more would come later
and if they should, to such an extent
that two teachers are necessary, I
will not hesitate to supply the sec
ond one. We must, however, be
consistent and just to all, and when
we think of over 40 pupils at Bon
fouca with seven grades in five
groups and oie teacher, I must not
be charged with being prejudiced if
I insist that the enrollment at Ram
say does not at present justify the
second teacher.
Upon examining the average daily
balances carried by this board for
the last year they were at the St.
Tammany Bank & Trust Co., we find
that the law will require a bond to
be given by the Covington Bank A
Trust Company, of even $20,000.00.
This the bank has agreed to give. As
the law regulating the amount of my
bond reads the same as that for the
fiscal agent I suspect you will expect
me to give a bond for $20,000.00
instead of $9,000.00, as at present.
In regard to the balance of inter
est on daily balances due us froth
the St. Tammany Bank & Trist Co.,
I wish to state that ,the bank has
made a settlement for balance due
for the year 1915-16, dmounting td
$555.96. They have very willi'ngly
promised to cheek over the accounts
for the Slidell special and gbeneral
odft or h yr 1. it-, a.d `
theatre, but in the case of Anna Pav
iowa, she will not only bring all of
her consummate artistry to the
screen, but she may be expected to
reveal herself as 'the greatest living
dancer, as the greatest living ex
ponent of pantomime, and as the
greatest actress as well. Those who
have idolized Pavlowa, at ,the Metro
politan Opera House and who paid
$5.00 for a seat for the privilege will
see a far greater Pavlowa when they
witness he rtriumph in the screen
spectacle based in Auber'a "Massa
lello."
This feature is in eight parts an d
will open with the big Sunday mati
nee at the popular prices of 15 and
25 cents.
shall be pleased to report their find
ings at our next meeting.
I submit today an itemized list of
my traveling expenses for the quarter
ending September 30, 19:16.
Thanking you for your co-opera
tion in the past and trusting that I
may be thought worthy to receive a
continuance of the same In the fu
ture, I beg to remain,
Very truly,
