ARER HUGHES
The Red Headed Editor of the
Wichita Eagle Asks Him
Some Pointed Questions
WHICH HE NEVER
WILL RESPOND TO
A Kansas Bull Moose Leader Who Led
the Fight Against Cannonlsm In
1910 and Who Has Been One of the
Most Conspicuous Figures in the
Progressive Party Does Not Propose
to Stand with Hughes and Caus
tically Says So.
Since the time that the prairie do?,
the cayote and the grasshopper were
driven out of Kansas Victor Murdock,
the now, editor of the Wichita Eagle,
has been one of that state's most
noted and strongest Republicans and
has had many party rewards for feal
ty, once being elected to congress,
where In 1910 he distinguished him
self by leading the fight against Can
nonlsm. He was in at the birth of
the Dull Moose, and since that natal
day has been one of the most ardent
supporters of that fad or cult. When
the break came with Teddy's shame
ful betrayal of the party at the Chi
cago convention, Murdock, who was
also present, balked and he has
stayed balked, for he will not support
Hughes, and he is not afraid to tell
why.
In a single recent issue of his paper,
The Eagle, Mr. Murdock is responsible
for three editorials, the first adding
to the many pointed questions Hughes
has left unanswered, the second point'
lng to the nation's unprecedented pros'
perlty and the third assailing Hay
mond Robins' argument in behalf of
tho election of a congress to support
Hughes. The second editori.il takes

pains to point out that tho present
prosperity dors not represent "a mero
orgy of speculation."
Will They Vote for a Strike?
The first editorial, under tho head
ing, "Will They Answer?" says:
"Since, It nppcarfl, tho Republicans
are to make their campaign largely in
opposition to the Adamson bill, a few
questions are pertinent. They should
be answered both by Mr. Hughes and
by those Republican candidates for
congress who follow his lead.
"Will Mr. Hughes urge, and tho Re
publican congressmen vote, for tho re
peal of the Adamson law, In case they
win congress?
"If they do so, and If that repeal
again brings the threat of a strike,
what course of action will Mr. Hughes
and congress pursue?
"It's one thing to criticize Mr. Wil
son for his strike settlement. It's an
entirely different thing deliberately to
vote a nation-wide railroad strike upon
the country. If that is what Mr.
Hughes 'election Is to mean, the peo
ple ought to be very certain that they
are willing to pay the price."
Prevailing Prosperity Sound
The second of these Interesting ut
terances is entitled "Wallowing In
Prosperity" and contains these state
ments: "Except when we see the actual fig
ures of what now Is In comparison
with what was, It is impossible to be
lieve the extent of the prosperity in
which the United States Is now fairly
wallowing. A few comparisons, taken i
from a recent Issue of the Wall Street I
Journal, tell the story far better than ,
words:
"The average price of railway
stocks on Sept. 16 was 109.16; a year1
ago it was 95.73. The average price
of industrials was 149.39, as against
105.18 a year ago.
"On Sept. 16, 1916, September wheat
sold in Chicago for 147M-. as against
101U a year ago; September corn for
86 against Tl1,; October cotton for
15.38 as against 10.54.
"On that same day Atchison stock
sold for lOe5 as against 102 a year
ago: Pennsylvania lSe-g against
109s; : Union Pacific 117 against
131; United States Steel 107 M against
756.
"Nor is this a mere orgy of specula

Is on a sound foundation."

IT WAS A GRAND AND GLORIOUS
DAY FOR MILITANT DEMOCRACY
Two of the Greatest Meetings of the
Campaign are Held at the
Lyceum Theatre
Secretary Daniels, Sen. Reed and Col.
Gardner Expound the Truths of
Democratic Doctrine
It was a bright, clear, sunshiny
day a typical glorious day a day fit
ted exactly to welcome such great
Democrats as Secretary Daniels, Sen
ator Reed and to-be-governor Gardner
a day for Democracy to rejoice over.
No one could have asked for a more
auspicious occasion than that of yes
terday when the hosts of Democracy
of St. Joseph and Northwest Missouri
gathered to pay tribute to those grand
Democrats and to listen and applaud
the words of truth and wisdom which
fell from their lips. It can be safely
said that more good was accomplished
for the cause yesterday than has been
done in all of the present campaign.
Speeches such as were made by Dan
iels, Reed and Gardner were worth
miles of travel to hear, and worth
their weight In gold to the Democ
racy and the people of this section.
It Is to be regretted that the early
hour at which this paper is forced to
go to press forbids giving their ad
dresses In full.
The Guest of Graham
Secretary Daniels is an old friend of
Joshua A. Graham of this city. They
were born and reared in the same sec
tion of Kentucky and have continued
their close friendly relations from
boyhood up. Mr. Graham went to
Macon Thursday, where the secretary
spoke that night, and brought him
here yesterday morning, where the
secretary breakfasted at the Graham
home. At 10 o'clock ho returned to
the Robidoux, where he was the cen
ter of attraction fo a great throng
during the forenoon and up to the
time of speaking.
Optimism is the dominant note with
Secretary Daniels. There is not a
question of doubt in his mind over the
outcome of the election and he fairly
bubbles over In his recitals of the
flattering conditions with which he
finds himself confronted at all points.
"President Wilson has earned the
gratitude of the country by his wise
and judicious conduct of affairs," said
he, "and there Is no party or power
that can prevent his triumphal re
election." Secretary Daniels was entertained
at luncheon at the Robidoux by a large
party of prominent Democrats of St.
Joseph, after which he was escorted
to the Lyceum, which he found
crowded to Its capacity with an audi
ence which cheered him to the echo
and assured him that this section was
his friend and the friend of his poli
cies. When he rose to speak after Hon.
W. F. Davis, chairman for the after
noon, had delivered a splendid Intro
ductory, he was greeted with a great
demonstration. Ho spoko entirely on
national Issues nnd there could be no
mistake as to his method of handling
the questions. On his particular fea
ture, the federal rural credits meas
ure, he said:
.The Rural Credits Act
'"The Wilson administration has en
acted the rural credits act, sometimes
called the farm loan bill, which ex
tends to the farmer the same advan
tage of credit that the merchant, the
manufacturer, and other classes of our
people have enjoyed. We all know
that tho fanner does not have ready
cash coming into his hands as fre
quently as other classes In our indus
trial life. Uy diversification of crops,
under the encouragement of the de
pat tment of agriculture, as it has been
administered for the three years past,
the farmers have been able to do this.
But the vast masses of our farmers
do not have ready money but once a
year, when they gin and bale their
cotton, and when they reap and thresh
their wheat, and shuck their corn, and
when they market their potatoes, their
cabbage, their apple crops, and the
like, in the fall. For years and years
the farmer has been asking for a sys
tem of credits suitable for his de
mands, which would enable him to bor
row money to buy new machinery, to
build sheds to house It from rain and
rust, to add to his herd of Jerseys
when a co-operative creamery is estab
lished in his midst, and to buy a cream
separator at the same time; and to
borrow this money from the same
credit sources and on the same credit
terms as the people over In town who
were in such financial circumstances
that they could make quick and fre
quent payments.
"There are 3,94S,722 farmers In the
United States who entirely own their
farms or have some sort of an Inter
est in the land they work, and theru
are 2,354,676 tenant .farmers who farm
226,512.813 acres valued at $10,977.
233,427. These farmers have mort-
I gaged their farms to the extent of
I hundreds of millions of dollars, and
this rural credits bill will help them
to pay off these Incumbrances of debt.
The mortgage indebtedness of the
country would not have been so enor
mous as it Is If the farmers' Just de
mand for as easy credit as anybody
else had been heeded. Europe long
ago faced this question and did justice
by the tarmlng population.
4 Never Made the Attempt
"No Republican administration ever
attempted to solve this problem. The
most that tho Republican party has
ever been willing to do when agricul
ture, labor, commerce, shipping, or any
form of business asked for help or re
lief, was to give another dose of pro
tectHe tariff. If that panacea for all
ills in the national life could not cure,
the patient was doomed, and nothing
could be done but to pull down the
shutters, step softly and wait for the
end. As Senator Hollis aptly says,
'The financial genius of the Repub
lican party was completely exhausted
by the enactment of the national bank
ing act of 1863 and 1S64,' In which
national banks were expressly forbid
den to loan money on land mortgage,
the best security In the world. Since
i that day a full half century and more
that iniquitous provision of our na
tional financial system was never re
pealed until the federal reserve act
jwas passed under the Wilson adminis
tration, i ins measure maue creuu
available to the farmer as never be
fore, since notes given for agricultural
I purposes or based on livestock were
declared eligible for rediscount of fed
I eral reserve banks. Farm paper was
I thereby placed on equal footing with
commercial paper as an Investment
for banks. In this way millions were
made available to tanners for short
term loans, and the records of the
national banks show that the farming
people were quick to avail themselves
of this privilege. In addition national
banks were permitted by the federal
reserve act to loan the farmer money
on the security of his farm.
Solved the Problem
"While the fanner was thus enabled
to get short term credit, it remained
to find a way for him to find easy
access to money seeking long term
Investment, of which there is ample
supply such as the savings of small
salaried persons, the widow's life in
surance, estates in the hands of ex
ecutors, college endowments, nssets
to be invested by receivers, etc. The
Hollls-Moss farm loan bill, or, as it is
ge'nerally called, the rural credits bill
a fitting complement to the federal re
serve bill, solved the problem of en
abling the farmer to borrow on long
time from this vast supply of money
seeking Investment. This has been
done through the system of farm loan
banks, farm loan associations, admin
istered by the federal farm loan board.
"Tho Republican platform criticizes
this law, but when It was put up for
passage In the senate only five Repub
lican senators, Urandego of Connecti
cut, Lodge of Massachusetts, Oliver of
Pennsylvania, Page of Vermont and
Wadsworth of New York, voted
against It, while the vote for It num-

GREAT MEETINGS HELD
Enthusiastic Audiences Greet the
Democratic Candidates at All of
the County Meetings
The Democratic county campaign
will close with a grand rally at De
Kalb tonight, where Louis V. Stlgall
and Congressman Booher will be the
principal speakers. All of the county
candidates will also be present, and a
specially good meeting Is anticipated.
This will close the active canvass of
the county and the candidates from
this time on will devote their energies
to meetings in the city.
All of the meetings held the week
past were of special note, the en
thusiasm being most pronounced. At
all points tho candidates were ac
corded a most cordial welcome and re
ceived by far larger crowds than were
anticipated. The interest manifested
shows that the full Democratic ticket
will be elected.
The Spring Garden meeting with
Horace Merritt as chief speaker Mon
day night was a decided success.
Tuesday night French Bottoms was
set on fire by the oratory of Judge
J. V.'. Mulr and the other candidates.
Wallace gave the candidates a most
loyal welcome Wednesday night and
promhed the usual heavy support.
C. A. Porter was the orator of the
evening at Maxwell schoolhouse
Thursday and the meeting was a pro
nounced success.
Barney Rellly was the orator at
Hurlingen last night and the meeting
was all that could be desired.
Tonight all will go to DeKalb and
that citadel of Democracy will resound
with the shouts of militant Democracy
enthused oer the recital of the deeds
of the great Democrats of the na
tion, state and county.
EVANDER BARKLEY HIT
Son of J. O. Barkley of the Stock
Yards Is Badly Wounded on the
Somme Front
Evander Barkley, ton of John O.
Barkley, general manager of the St.
fJoseph stock yards, was badly wound
ed on the Somme front in France three
weeks ago, where he was fighting
with the Canadian contingent of the
British army. Young Uarkley, while
in Canada, was seized with the mili
tary spirit and enlisted in the Ca
nadian army and was sent across the
waters and to the front.
One day oung Barkley, who was a
corporal, was sent out with a squad
to place a gun. While so engaged a
shrapnel shell exploded in front of him
and he was literally sprinkled with
splinters of the projectile, but not dis
abled. Before he could find cover a
second shell burst near him and he
received another deluge, and was then
shot through both legs and through
the hips by machine gun bullets. He
was taken to a hospital, where he now
is. He Is twenty-five years old. It is
expected that he will recover.

small, in every section of the country.
Mr. McCormlck said the speeches

but the president will not come until
the last week of the campaign. No
