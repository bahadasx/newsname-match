MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE, INCLUDING MEN,

GREETED OR SALUTED PRESIDENT AND MRS. WILSON, WHO WAS

WAY THROUGH THE STREETS AND BOULEVARDS OF THIS CITY.

Last Saturday evening a meeting
a ad moving picture show was staged
at the Odd Fellows' Hall, 3333 South
ttate street in the interest of Governor
Hdward F. Dunne. To say the least, it
was a good meeting from start to fin
ish. The various moving pictures were
xecptionally good and interesting.
They represented scenes and views in
connection with the Lincoln Jubilee or
rlebration which was held at the Col
ispum, the latter part of August and
Ike first part of September, 1915, and
tltc part played by Governor Dunne in
tbat direction. The picture illustrat
ing the Elks' parade and many of the
exhibits in the Coliseum at that time
was positive proof that the Afro-Amer-iran
continues to steadily advance or
progress in many different directions
at the same time.
The picturo showing Governor Dunne
in the act of laying the cornerstone of
tie new Eighth Regiment armory and
the Regiment passing in review brought
Jown the house which was filled to the
brim by tho better or the respectable
rlass of Colored men and women who
also loudly applauded every time his
icturo was flashed upon the screen.
lohn "V. Hardy performed his part
ttpII in connection with the moving
icturo show and the meeting as it
drew to a close William II. Clark, who
it one of the best and most efficient
lerks of the Municipal Court at tho
Smith Clark street station, delivered a
rrry logical and eloquent talk in be
talf of Governor Dunne.
The Colored voters Dunne Club of
which we have not the honor of being
ne of its members has gotten out a
'ttle pamphlet which sets forth some
I'M he reasons why the Colored voters
an afford to assist Governor Dunne
w.th their votes at every stage of the
jame, it states in ono part that "no
Colored person over asked for a chnigo
i" venue from his court when he was
no of tho Judges of the Circuit Court
f Cook County, that at the Public
Library can bo found.
(If you wish to verify tho next com
ig paragraph) find on file tho Chicago
Tribune of February 15, 1903, in which
w an account of a gathering of very
prominent men from different sections
of the country whose object was to dis
cuss the "Race question." Among
them sat Judge Edward F. Dunne.
Now read his exact statement made at
the time before the body assembled.
"I believe in the Negro. I do not
believe that he has progressed back
ward, as the paradox has been put. He
has been held back by race prejudice
which has placed every possible obsta
cle in his way. That he has survived
thsse hindrances and advanced as far
as he has is proof that his case is far
from hopeless, as some affect to see it.
You cannot argue the Colored ques
tion on reason. It is bound about by
too much prejudice. But give the Col
ored man the encouragement and as
sistance to advance and I believe he
is certain to command that respect
which must be the aggressive factor in
allaying the race prejudice that grips
the South.
"That same aversion is with us
here in the North. The Colored man
is by no means given the opportunity
which he merits. Is there any demand
for young Colored women of education
who seek even tho position of type
writer? Ts there any tendency to give
employment to young Colored men of
ability as bookkeepers or responsible
posts which might pave the way to fu
ture advancement! No, we arc beset
by the same prejudice. 'Why, if our
children come home from school and
say that a Colored pupil has been given
the adjoining desk there is usually a
request to the teacher to effect a
change.' It is the same story here as
in the South except that the great
problem of blacks there emphasizes
conditions.
"The Negro will solve his own sal
vation as wo aid him. We should
spend of our prosperity and plenty to
give them every possible facility for
education and mental and mortil ad
vancement. Ho needs a moral support
to develop his moral character a de
velopment which is as essential, even
more so, as that ho should learn to read
and write and cipher.
"We need to extend a plenty of
charity to the black man. If this is
done he will work out his own problem.
When he has advanced until he claims
our support and assistance through
sheer ability and energy then we will
no longer have a race problem here so
far as the black man is concerned.
"Statements of public men who af
fect to see bloodshed and race wars in
the future are, to my mind, absurd.
Such talk does not aid to solve this
pressing question. It retards and hin
ders and is stirring up further ob
stacles in the South. Passion, force
and haste will never make for a settle
ment of this question. Above every
thing, keep politics out of it.
"You will please bear in mind that
these were the sentiments of our Gov
ernor in 1903 and that he at that time
was not running for office, but was giv
ing expression- to the natural, manly
sentiments which were then, and still
are, part of him. Along during that
same period, a young Colored woman,
Mrs. Hudgins by name, was in her own
home with her nine-months-old baby
in her arms, attending to her house
hold duties, when a White peddler at
tempted to assault her. In her first
frenzy of protecting her honor, she
snatched a knife from a table and
stabbed him, as a result of which he
died. The coroner's jury held her to
the Grand Jury, the Grand Jury bound
her over to the Criminal Court, and she
went to trial before Judge Dunne, and
the jury found her guilty and she re
ceived a sentence carrying to fourteen
years in Joliet.
' "During all her trouble she still car
ried her little baby with her. Thanks
to Judge Dunne, in about two months
she was a free woman, back home with
her husband. This was another act of
justice done with no thought of a 1916
campaign, nor a bid for votes, but tho
honest act of a real man."
-
President and Mrs. Woodrow Wilson,
very happily invaded Chicago Thurs
day, and from noon on that day until
lae that evening they hit the high
places at a rapid clip. Their arrival
at the La Salle street station drew
thousands of people to that spot or
place and from the time that they
landed until their departure, many
honors were showered upon them by
the citizens of Chicago, both Demo
crats and Republicans and it is esti
mated that more than one hundred
thousand people including men, women
and children of all races and nationali
ties greeted them and extended a hearty
or royal welcome as they wended their
way through the streets and boule
vards of this city.
The President and Mrs. Wilson, who
were both wreathed in smiles all the
timo were conveyed to the Blackstone
hotel and in the afternoon they were
the highly honored and tho distin
guished guests of the Chicago Press
Club in the City Hall Square Building
and while getting on the outside of his
plain and simplo repast he made a
groat hit with the newspaper men and
their invited guests, his talk was right
to the point. Later on in the after
noon, he addressed a great nonpartisan
women's meeting at' tho Auditorium
and his remarks seemed to take well
with tho ladies. After winding up at
that meeting, the President and his
charming new bride visited the head
quarters of tho western branch of the
Democratic National Committee in the
Karpen Building, which was very
pleasing to the big chiefs of his pnrty,
An informal reception was held in their
honor and in a very short time several
thousand people greeted them. E.

A
HON. JOSEPH F. HAAS.
Popular German-American citizen and Republican candidate for Recorder of
Deeds of Cook county, to be voted for Tuesday, November 7th.
Mr. Haas was born in Chicago, No
vember 13, 1857 and was educated in
the public schools of this Tcity. lie was
employed by Jameson & Morse Print
ing Co. in 1S73-74. He entered the
employ of J. S. Barnes & Co. (Hatters
and Furriers) as errand boy and became
a partner in 1S90. Ho continued in
business until elected Clerk of the Sani
tary District of Chicago in 1S98. He
resigned on Juno 11, 1900, on account
of the illness of his partner.
Mr. Haas was elected State Senator
from the 25th Senatorial District in
1902-1906. As State Senator ho intro
duced and was instrumental in passing
many important measures. Ho was
Chairman of tho Chicago Charter Com
mittee of the 44th General Assembly.
Among the important bills which he
introduced, which aro now laws, were
the bills creating the Municipal Courts
of Chicago, which abolished the old
rolicc Justice System; tho bill creating
Forest Preserve which is making possi
ble tho conservation of woodlands in
the County for Public Park purposes;
a bill for consolidation of Public Park
Systems, and several other bills giving
to the park boards power to maintain
and govern the Parks and Boulevards
under their control; a bill fixing the
date limit on tho time which persons
could sue a municipality for personal
injuries, a law which has saved Chi
cago and other cities hundreds of thou
sands of dollars.
Mr. Haas also voted for amendments
to tho Torrens System which has broad
ened its scope.
Mr. Haas was elected County Clerk
in 1906 and conducted tho business of
that office in an efficTent manner.
The Recorder is the official custodian
of all the records affecting tho title
of every piece of property in this coun
ty. He conducts big business, requir
ing the attention of a man of consid
erable business experience. For 30
years Chicagoans have known me as a
business man. If elected Recorder I
promise to give that office tho benefit
of my years of experience.
A great deal of my time and atten
tion will be devoted to the Torrens
office, of which the Recorder is the of
ficial head. The Torrens system is in
expensive and once tho property is put
under it, a transfer can be had in a
very short time and for the small con
sideration of $3. It is an admirable sys
tem for poor and rich alike but more
particularly for the small property own
er who wants relief from the expensive
system of abstracts of title.
If I am elected Recorder I promise
to have the Torrens system organized
along the most scientific business line-:
J
talent obtainable for the highly special
ized work required in that office. J I
shall not attempt to uso that most im
portant branch of public service for
political purposes or for my personal
aggrandizement.
If the growth of tho Torrens sysfeni
lias not been as great as its merits
justify, it is duo entirely to tho fact
that people do not have confidence in
tho political appointments which here
tofore have been made in this oRice.
Only men of skill and experience in ex
amining title should bo employed in
the Torrens office. With tho experts
which I shall employ, with my pcrorial
application of business methods, I shall
make the Torrens system moro poyufar
in this country than it has been here
tofore. I propose to make that tho dis
tinguishing feature of my administra
tion. V
Mr. Haas is a member of many Ma
ternal, social and other organizations.
Chief among them are Maplewood Coun
cil No. 1021, Koyal Arcanum; Enterprise
Council No. HO, Koyal League, Ivi I win
ning Lodge No. 311, A. F. & A. .?.;
Oriental Consistory; Mcdinah Temple;
Wicker Park Manncnchor: Vcrjin
Deutsche Presse; Sliepncr Athletic Cbjb;
Brentana Neighborhood. Association;
Aurora Turn Vcrein; Chicngo Sharp-
I propose further to hire the best legal I "hooters Association. Adv.
Colored men passed by ami grabbed
tho President and Mrs. Wilson by the
hand.
United States Senator Thomas J.
Walsh, Western Democratic campaign
manager and Hon. Charles Boeschen
stein were both all smiles and atten
tion during the visit of the President
and Mrs. Wilson at the headquarters
and Senator Walsh does not hesitate
right out in open meeting, in predict
ing the re-election of the present chief
executive of tlm Nation with both
hands down and Senator Walsh is loud
in contending that "there is nothing to
it but the shouting after his reeloc
tion."
Thursday evening, President Wilson
delivered his last address in Chicago
for the present, at, the stockyards pa
vilion,
ing of
It was the third annual rr- et
tho new Citizen ' Allegijn.ce
celebration at the pavilion and aout
fifteen thousand people managed to
jam themselves into it and more than
ten thousand men and women vrith
children in their arms were unable to
crowd into it. All in nil, tho Prescient
nn.l Mrs. Wilon had a crand and
strenuous time in Chicago.
