By Mabel Abbott.
On the other side of the munic
ipal waterway, all summer long,
the Seaborn Shipbuilding Vo. has
been building a couple of "good
ly vessels."
" The keel of a third will belaid
in a day or two, and one of the
boati now building will probably
be launched the first week in
December.
These are not horizontal sky
scrapers of metal, with funnels
instead of masts, and no more
poetry about Ihem than a pair of
tin cans.* They are compact lit
tle wooden ships, and though
they will have engines, they will
go out clothed in canvas, as ships
should.
They are part of a picturesque
thing that is going on in Ameri
ca—the revival of the building of
wooden ships.
Ten years ago, shipbuilder!
say, this was almost a lost art in
the United States. Tron ships
may be less poetic, but they are
more practical, especially in the
largo- sizes, according to ship
ping men.
In the Northwest, where the
best of wood for shipbuilding
grows near at hand, and where
men have found that a wooden
ship can be hauled off an unchart
ed rock in Alaskan waters,
patched up, and put back to
work little the worse for it, while
an iron ship with a hole punched
in her bottom is often not worth
Raving, wooden ships had not
been so superseded; but even
here, the business had sunk to a
shadow of its former greatness.
What War Did
And then came the war.
Of all the things the war has
brought about, none is more
striking than the demand for
ships.
Also, the war raised the price
of steel, because the steel men
can get more for it in the form of
guns and shells than in the form
of ship-plates.
And so the wooden ship came
into her own again.
The condition may be only
temporary, so far as the use of
wood is concerned. Probably
when the war is over, we shall
build iron ships again.
At any rate, more wooden
shifts are being built now than in
decades before.

Her backbone, ribs and deck
frames are built of timbers so
heavy they look like the supports
of a bridge. The nighty "knees"
that brace her at every angle are
Dot sawed from an ordinary
piece of timber, but each one is
the junction of the trunk and
branch of a tree, cut so that the
curving filters bind the frame
with the strength of Nature.
The great timbers that line
and sheathe her, are steamed and
bent to her shape. The spaces
between her ribs will be packed
with 40 tons of rock salt, which
will gradually pickle her to iron
toughness.

Working in the yards at present,
and though drills and hammers
are driven by air now, and saws
and planes are harnessed to mo
tors, some things are still done
very much as they were done by
shipbuilders centuries ago; for a
ship is a wonderful thing, all
curves and slants and sheers,
and nothing can altogether take
the place of the skilled hand in
fitting her for her wrestle with
wave and whirlwind.
Men with adzes "dub" tim
bers and planks to smoothness;
others spin oakum with tarry
fingers to calk her seams; and
there are many place! where
wooden pegs are still better than
iron bolts.
Before very long, she will slip
from her cradle into the water,
one of a generation of ships born
of a strange world-need.
As far back as January, Secre
tary Redfield said, "American
shipyards have under construc
tion now more vessels than ever
before were building in the Unit
ed States, to add to an American
merchant marine whose gross
tonnage already is the largest in
the country's history."
Since that time, with hastily
increased facilities, ship-build
ing has increased tremendously.
We are now building not oniy
for ourselves, but for other na
tions. Norway has passed a law
requiring that all money made in
the shipping business shall be
put back into the shipping busi
ness; and Norwegian orders have
been pouring into American
ship-yards.
Perhaps Americans are to be
come the ship-builders of the fu
ture.

If Any of You Other Girls Want
to be Famous, Here's a Suggestion
Many a girl sighed enviously,
no doubt, as the applause died
away after Eunice Prossor's first
big number at the Tacoma thea
ter Friday night.
"it's a wonderful thing to have
genius," they thought, as the
little girl who used to go to the
Stadium high school only a few
years ago bowed again and again
to the audience that rejoiced to
find Its faith In her more than
justified.
The Orpheus club, whose pro
tege she has been since her play
ing first attracted its attention,
was there to hear her prove that
she really has in her the mnking
of one of the foremost women
violinists of America.

BERLIN, Oct. 21.—A new sys

Merlin, whereby everyone must
buy underclothing, men's and
women's suits and coats through
special magistrate's cards.
The city experienced its first
frosty night last night and con
sequently there was a great rush
for the new clothing cards.
The crowds were so great that
it was necessary to give out num
bers to the newcomers and allow
them to stand in line.
Piece gcods, excepting silks,
for some time have been pur
chasable only by presenting
cards.
One object of the new clothing
regulations is to prevent specu
