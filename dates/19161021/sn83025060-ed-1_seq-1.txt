With a elctci munition to never cease and io fight on until every
election oflieial in Oklahoma ia jailed who denies black men thcii
liberty and ficc access to the voting privilege, the Negroes of Okla
homa have risen up in aims to, with their dollars, slain these scoun
drels and rascals into the Federal courts. In most of the counties
of this state the Negroes have in largo numbers registered un
molested but in Mcintosh, Muskogee, Wagoner and Okfuskee coun
ties, the real black belt of Okhhon;a, there has been a .lagrant vio
lation of the recent Supreme Court decision and Negroes have beer,
intimidated and abused by the minions of Gov. Williams. For in
stance, at Renticsville, a Negro town in Mcintosh county, where
there are 180 electors, four Negroes rre registered. At Eufaula
with about 400 black electors, si:; have been permitted to qualify
In the cily of Muskogee, with about 12,000 odd Negroes, thcii
rights have been curtailed and denied with a viciousness unhop.rc
of in this state. At Eolcy, which is situated in Paden District No. 2
with 500 odd electors, not a single Negro i3 registered save and ex
cept three or four who afliliatc w ith the Democratic party. Wagonei
county registrars were equally as ruthless in their disregard foi
the citizenslrp rights of black men ar.d the time is ripe for a fear
less and dctcmiined stand against the outrageous encroachment o
Southern prejudice. 1-hcrc will be no begging for the assistance oi
any political party in this fight. It io a'problom that belongs solelj
to black men and they propose to shoulder their own burden and
face the enemy with black initiative and intelligence.
In the supplemental registration, which begins the 18th anc
continues for ten dry-3, the Negroes of the various counties whe
have not been permitted to register intend to peaceably and lawfully
present themselves before the registrar. They propose to have
present with them witnesr.es. On election morning these name
Negroes, registered or unregistered, propose to present themselves
to vote and have witnesses in thi3 instance. Also, with this rccor.
made, they propejo to file sui's for damages in the Federal courts
against e'cry Section official vho denies black men their Consti
tutional rights. Hacking this ir.avo arc all of the Negro newspaper
of the state, v ho have started already a campaign for funds. Law
yers will bo employed and a -v igorous and forceful fight be made tc
prosecute every cowardly attempt to confiscate the liberty that is
justly the right oi black men.
A citizens committee has been formed to hold the many dol
lars that are pouring into this fund, the members of whith are Dr.
A. 13. Whitby, president of the Oklahoma City branch of the Nation-

Every loyal member of the

entirely, the- guidi: g srh'ifs of the movement are actuated by but
one purpose and that i3 the decire to cffcctunlize the black man's
right to do anything in Oklahoma, that, under the law, any other
