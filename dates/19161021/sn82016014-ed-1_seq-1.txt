An ideal football day was the con
tribution the weather man made to
the local football enthusiasts who had
plans made to attend this afternoon's
battle hetw-een the Ichabods and
Baker university on Washburn field.
"You could not ask for a more per
fect day," Doctor Kennedy said before
the game, "and the playing field could
not be in better condition, the recent
rain having put the soil in the pinkest
of pink."
The largest crowd of the season was
expected to be in the bleachers when
the kickoff came at 3 o'clock because
of the old rivalry between the two
schools and because of the fact that
the game had an important bearing on
the Kansas conference race. .
Haker I'ndefeated.
The Baldwin Methodists now have
the only team' in the conference with
an undefeated record and unless they
are stopped pretty soon will be striv
ing for an all-victorious season. All
other teams In the race for the title
have been defeated except Friends and
the Emporia Normal and they have
held each other to a tie.
Not a word of dope preceded the
Bakerites before their arrival here
and local dopesters were entirely ig
norant of the strength and condition
of Coach Schlademan's men. Odds
were scarce on both teams, and most
prophets were predicting a close,
hard-fought contest.
"I am prepared for any kind of a
surprise," Coach Kennedy said. "It is
all up to the boys. Maybe they will
lick us by a big score, and maybe we
w ill beat them 40 to 0. Vn.i en n't
tell."
All of the Washburn players were
reported in excellent condition for the
fray.

HE SEES NO HARM IN IT
Preacher Says It Doesn't Hurt
to Kiss "Pretty" Girl.
Audrey Munson In "Tude" Did
n't "Get byw Censors.
State house jobs may come and go
but many motion picture films appear
in Kansas only once. State house em
ployes are taking no chances on the
censor board's passing certain exten
sively advertised pictures.
In short, the movie bug has the state
house in its grip and when Audrey
Munson and other famous actresses
appear in the nude, as Audrey did this
morning, in the dark basement of the
state house, affairs of state must run
themselves, and the news reading
public doesn't get much news from
the state house. A few may blush but
no one misses such pictures if it can
be helped.
. Censor Eye Didn't Approve,
Audrey Munson, the famous artist's
model, came to Kansas in the nude
in "Purity." She didn't please the
censor eye of the Rev. Festus Foster
and the picture was rejected. In fact,
when Audrey first stepped up the
stage with nothing on, the Rev. Mr.
Foster exclaimed:
"Has that woman no soul?"
The picture men appealed to the
appeal board this morning and the
censor board was upheld. Arguments
were to the effect that statuary much
worse appeared even in the public li
brary in Topeka.
Another picture was appealed to the
appeal board. It is "The Kiss," a
picture in which a young man kisses
a girl at a masked ball. She runs
away and he tries to locate the girl
with the "one kiss," kissing every
thing for miles around in his quest.
The kissing part was all right.
The fact of the matter is that the Rev.
Mr. Foster was stirred to a reminis
cent vein during the progress of the
picture and told of kissing thirteen
girls In one evening at Washburn col
lege in his palmy days.
"I never could see harm in kissing
a pretty girl," said the minister.
But in one part of the picture is a
gambling scene. In the progress of a
game, "a pretty woman isn't satisfied
with three aces and reaches into the
top of a shoe for a fourth ace. She
doesn't show even an inch of stocking.
But that part must be cut out. The
picture men will appeal.
Late this afternoon "The Common
Law." a problem play, will be thrown
on the screen and it is an assured fact
that the censors won't be the only
persons in Kansas to see it.

Four Street Railway Employes

Slippery Tract Cause for Acci

Four men, employes of the street
railway, were injured, all painfully,
but, it is said, not seriously, by flying
glass and the force of the shock at
7:45 o'cIock this morning when two
"tripper" or extra cars on the Wash-burn-Douthitt
line crashed head-on
as one car was attempting to stop and
the other was practically standing
still. The accident occurred between
Western avenue and Fillmore streets
on Sixteenth. Four passengers on the
inbound car escaped injury, according
to officials of the street railway com
pany, other than being badly shaken
up. There were no passengers on the
outbound car.
Both cars were new ones, of the
front end type. R. A. Ragan, con
ductor on the outbound car, was cut
over the eye by flying glass and bruis
ed painfully about the face and head.
William Rose, motorman on the same
car, suffered a severely wrenched left
leg and was otherwise shaken up. He
was thrown back to the center of the
car by the force of the impact.
Injuries Not Serious.
A. L. Brooks, conductor on the in
bound car, was 3ut on the face and
bruised. M. A. Cooper, motorman on
the same car, was cut slightly by fly

the street railway company the in

prove serious.

of It all is that the people have no gas
at any price and can't get it at 28

because the gas companies are hec

Kansas City. Mo., Oct. 21. In the
natural gas hearing before Judge
Booth, sitting in the United States dis
trict court in Kansas City, Kan., yes
terday, there was a continuation of the
argument which had occupied all of
the previous day on the questions of
the validity of the distributing con
tracts and the jurisdiction of the court
as to a final determination of the case.
From 10 o'clock yesterday morning
until 4 o'clock in the afternoon attor
neys for the distributing companies,
the utilities commissions and repre
sentatives of the Kansas attorney gen
eral's office argued upon these mat-
! ters.
I It was not until 4 o'clock that all of
tnese conienaing aerenaam attorneys
had been heard. At that time Senator
Chester I. Long, representing John M.
Landon, receiver for the Kansas Nat
ural Gas company, began his argu
ment, which was interrupted by the
adjournment of court until this morn
ing. Senator Long's preliminary re
marks were confined to technical mat
ters and the citation of legal authori
ties. Some of the witnesses on both
sides who had been in attendance at
the hearing were excused until Mon
day morning so that they might return
to their homes. It is believed that
practically all of today's session will
be given over to the conclusion of Sen
ator Long's remarks, the argument of
John H. Atwood for the receiver and
a few additional remarks by attorneys
for the distributing companies. Court
was convened at 9:30 o'clock and ad
journment was scheduled to be taken
at 2 o'clock until Monday morning.

Chicago, Oct. 21.- A. F. Chase. 45
years old, was arrested and questioned
at the stockyards police station here
today in connection with the daring at
tempt to steal $25,000 in gems last
night in which one was killed and
another wounded.
The police are searching for a jan
itor, Thomas Inns, who went to a phy
sician early today with a bullet wound
in his neck and another in his chest.
After he left, the physician became
suspicious and gave a description of
Inns to the police. He told the doc
tor he was shot by holdup men. It
was reported the police are holding
two other suspects secretly, but this
could not be confirmed. The police are
also looking for Geo. Irwin, alleged
blackmailer, to question him.
Jeweler Opened Fire.
Chicago, Oct. 21.- No trace had
been found early today of the two ban
dits who in a daring, but unsuccess
ful attempt to seize $ 25,000 in gems
killed Louis Lichtenstein, an advertis
ing man, and wounded Emil Noel,
jeweler, late yesterday.
The shooting took place at the en
trance to Noel's garage as he and
Lichtenstein drove home from the loop
jewelry store owned by Noel. He car
ried the gems in a chamois bag in an
inner pocket.
Noel opened fire on the two robbers.
Bullets flew both ways. Lichtenstein, I
sitting in the automobile, was instant- i

"ADVERSITY TO THE MASSES"
Unjust Provisions Is Claim of
Signed Representatives.
"Unequal Distribution of Peo
ple's Money," Is Plea.
The most radical step by railway
employes in this country regarding the
famous Adamson bill in congress was'
taken todav by a committee represent-
in(f eighty per cent of the men In the
employ of the railroads not belonging
to the brotherhoods, when they is
sued a statement from the headquar
ters of the committee in Topeka con
demning the law as "unjust, unfair and
with adversity to the masses."
The statement was signed by the
following railway shopmen: John
Isaacson, Harry Service. James mui
lin, William Zarker, Frank Sandmeyer,
Ralph Schaffer, John Fritze, Dan
Lane and Ben Mitchell, mostly from
the big headquarters shop of the
Atchison. Topeka & Santa Fe in To
peka. The statement in full follows:
The Statement.
We, the undersigned committee, ap
pointed at a meeting of representatives
of the 80 per cent of railway employes
who are not included in the increase
of pay given by the so-called Adamson
eight-hour law, desire to protest
against the unfair and unequal dis
tribution of the people's money, and
present the following as a fair and
impartial summing up of this act of
congress from the viewpoint of 80
per cent of railway employes.
First of all, railway employes as a
whole are not in sympathy with the
statement frequently made that the
heads of the Four Brotherhoods are
unpatriotic or disloyal to the country.
On the other hand, they believe that
the leaders have been and are thoroly
loyal to their clients, the members of
their organization, and have led them
out of a situation that threatened to
be their "Waterloo. ' It may be true
. ,v, ,,iioi ,if !
their organization they may have been
men uutdiiEii ill icixuiiiB nielli yi 11 lu
the shcals that threatened to wreck
their craft and that this made it neces
sary to adopt desperate measures to
save themselves and their followers,
but the men judge their acts from the
standard of the world in which we live
and not by the high ideals that should
animate a truly Christian nation. They
give them the credit for playing the
game and winning on a bluff. They
saved their organization and thus
proved their loyalty to the members
of the Brotherhoods who were and
are their employers.
Xo Eight-Hour Day.
But what can be said for the admin
istration and the members of con
gress who are supposed to represent
an tne people, aye: sworn to do so?
Did they represent the majority or the
brotherhood portion of their constit-
uents? Did they stand for what they
considered right? No one who knows
anything about the operation of a rail
road will honestly contend that the
Adamson law means an eight-hour
day, for which the trade unions are
fighting. If anyone doubts this state
ment, let him investigate whether or
not under this law a train or engine
crew, which now make the run from
Kansas City to Newton in about seven
hours and for which they receive pay
for two hundred miles or two days,
will be compelled to lay in Newton un
til twenty-four hours have elapsed
from the time they left Kansas City.
If this is the meaning of the Adamson
law, then there is a liability of a strike
within the brotherhoods against it. If
it does not mean that, then it does not
conform to what the majority of union
men claim they are contending for,
and therefore the Adamson bill does
not give an eight-hour day.
Receive More-Pay.
What it really means is that the
men shall receive the same pay for
eight hours' work as some of them
formerly had to work ten for. In oth- ';
er words, on runs which formerly took j
ten hours or more to make, the men !
receive overtime after eight hours
have expired instead of ten as hereto- ,
fore. This means one or two thinsrs,
the railroads must either pay the men
more for making the run, or they
must reduce the load and increase the
number of trains and in either case
the cost for hauling a ton of freight
per mile will be increased.
It has been intimated, and we be
lieve even promised, that if, after in
vestigation, this is proven to be true,
an increase of rates will be eranted.
Right here is where the unskilled and
other classes feel that the administra
tion and congress are doing them an
irreparable wrong, for they know if
rates go up the cost of living is in-
I creased and their already overbur
dened condition is made worse. Mark
you: they do not blame the brother-
' Vinnrla hut thn.lf whn nrA VTx-rtrrt n
legislate for all the people and not for
any particular class.
This kind of prosperity to the fa
vored few means adversity to the
masses and this is true whether the
j eThood or are the members of a rich
corporation. Let us throw aside all
cant and admit that if rates are to be
raised to benefit a class already well
paid, measured by the standard of our
country, it must come out of the flesh j

Paris. Oct. 21. German troops ap
parently are trying to regain the ml
tiative on the Somme. Repeated, ter-
rific counter-attacks have been dellv-
ered by the Teutons especially north
of the river to the past few days, pre
ceded by a heavy expenditure of am
munition. Each of these blows, ac
cording to reports from French head
quarters has been shattered, one after
another.
The French continue slowly but
surely winning their objectives on the
Somme. the heights, railways and im
portant highway junctions.
The Germans are suffering greatly
from inferiority in the aerial branch
of warfare on the Somme, the head
quarter's reports say. As rapidly as
German airmen appear along the
Anglo-French front they are attacked
and driven back. The German com
manders thus far lack information
about movements going on behind the
allied front.
German Aim Poor.
In several instances in the last few
days, the Germans have spread a cur
tain fire over vacant ground, wasting
shells lavishly for lengthy periods,
either because of poor range directing
by their aviators or because of nerv
ousness on the part of their com
manders, fearing an attack at some
unexpected point.
French officials declared today that
they have learned that the Germans
are now systematically trying to cre
ate the impression among the neutrals
that France is worn out by twenty

Dismiss State Receivers.
File Motion to Vacate the Flan

Kansas City, Mo., Oct. 21. Attor
neys continued their arguments be
fore Judge Wilbur Booth in the fed
eral court at Kansas City, Kan., today
in the injunction proceedings institut-
ed by the Kansas Natural Gas com
i pany against the public utilities com
missions of Missouri and Kansas, and
state and county officials, to prevent
them from interfering with rate
changes proposed by the company. No
decision regarding the various motions
placed before the court at previous
sessions have been handed down.
Announcement was made today thai
J. A. Harzfeld, city counsellor of Kan
sas City, Mo., and Judge Hugh J.
Smith, city counsellor of Kansas City,
Kan., would file a motion before Judge
Booth asking him to dismiss the
present injunction, take original juris
diction from the federal court in the
company's affairs and dismiss the

Would Hare Put Thru Villa
Job Up to Handle.
NO PUSSY FOOTING FOR COL.
'Bucky" O'Xeill Would Hare
Tamed Border In 90 Days.
Speech In Famous Arizona
Sheriff's Home Townl
Aboard Roosevelt Special Train,
Pruscott, Ariz., Oct. 21. Ex-President
Roosevelt would have gone into Mex
ico up to the mt if he had been pres
ident last spring. He told an audi
ence here today that he would have
put in charge of the border difficulty
a man of the type of "Bucky" O'Neill.
Prescott was "Bucky's" home town..
"Bucky" died in Roosevelt's arms on
San Juan Hill. Roosevelt declared
"Bucky," if alive, could have cleaned
up the border in ninety days. Roose
velt said:
"I am asked what I would have
done, in Mr. Wilson's case in Mexico.
The answer is perfectly simple. I
would either have made up my mind
to hit or not hit. But under no cir
cumstances would I have hit soft.
Hit Hard or Not at AIL
The right rule is don't hit at all if
you can help it. If you must hit a
man, don t hit him soft; knock him
out.
Pershing was sent after Villa if
he was sent at all it should have been
understood that the job was to be put
thru up to the handle. When Car
ranza said Pershing could not use the
railroads I would have instantlv re
sponded: 'General Pershing will use
the railroads and he will treat as an
enemy any man who interferes with
mm.
"When Carranza said Pershing
could not enter the towns, I would
have said: 'He shall enter the town.
He shall go anywhere and he shall
treat any one opposing him as acting
in the interests of Villa.'
"Above, all, when Carranza and the
Carranza soldiers fought our troops
and killed them I would have instantly
directed Pershing to strike back as
hard as he knew how and not inquire
which particular bandits killed our
men. If this had been done, the trou
ble would have been settled last June.
It would have opened the mines and I
will guarantee that four-fifths of the
insurgent armies would instantly have
gone back to work when they found
they could get wages and food and
protection.
They All Know "Bnrky."
"This is the town or 'Bucky O'Xeill.
You know him. He was a sheriff here
before he went to my regiment. When
he was sent after desperate criminals
he took 'em and he took 'em with a
gun. He did not pat their wrists and
say he would like them to be good. He
showed he meant business and he got
his man.
"I would have put on the border a
man of O'Neill's type, with instructions
to deal with international criminals
like these Villista and Carranzista ban
dits just as he dealt with the Canon
Diablo train robbers down here. We
now have 150.000 soldiers on the bor
der. They've been there four months.
If Bucky O'Neill were alive today I
would have put him on the border
with a proper force under him and I
will guarantee that in ninety days
there would be no bandit venturing
to wink cross-eyed at us. and If we
had a man in the White House, this
kind of thing would be done now."
NOBODY WANTS HER
Insane Woman Not Allowed to Remain
Anywhere Long.
Three hours after I L. Kiene, sher
iff, had put Delia Jacobs, an insane
woman, upon a train with a ticket for
Galesburg, 111., he received a letter
from the sheriff in Galesburg advising;
that she be not sent there: that while
she had two sisters living there neither
of them could afford to care for her.
The letter stated that the two sisters
were forced to work for their own liv
ing and could devote neither time nor
money to her. The sheriff in Gales
burg suggested that the Jacobr woman
be placed in an institution h?re.
The fact that Delia Jacobs is Insane
was first discovered in the Topeka
state hospital, where she had secured
a position as an attendant by letter.
When the hospital authorities dis
covered that she was mentally unbal
anced they discharged her and sent
her back to Topeka. She obtained a
room in the Y. W. C. A. and one peace
ful Sunday morning, she became vio
lently insane and it took the combined
efforts of the sheriff and police de
partment to capture her. The Jacobs
woman came to Topeka from Kirks
ville, Mo.
