No Strings Tied to the
Directors.
CAN GO INTO ANY
BUSINESS THEY WISH
First Light is Shed on Mys
tery When Articles of Cor
poration are Made Public
Bismarck, N. D., Oct. 21.—The first
light thrown on the mysterious mll
Iton-dollar corporation of the non

of almost in whispers for some weeks,
is given by F. B. Wood of Fargo, who
is to be president and general man
ager of the project and who is now
manager of the Equity Live Stock ex
change at South St. Paul.
Not even the proposed incorporators
or the proposed directors of the cor
poration were able to answer ques
tions on the subject previous to the
arrival in the city of Mr. Wood, with
the preliminary papers for the incor
poration. Mr. Wood talked freely of
the project and gave some general in
formation of the plans and purposes,
which are apparently so broad that
the directors, or rather three of them,
can embark in any business they fan
cy and can oust any stockholder who
objects to their course. The articles
of incorporation include the follow
ing provisions:
To buy, sell and leas* real es
tate in any state or territory.
To buy, sell or exchange per
sonal property of all kinds, in
cluding drafts, notes, bonds, mort
gages and all commercial paper.
To make loans on personal or
real property and to invest all
funds of the corporation in any
way deemed advisable by the
board of directors.
To give its promissory note
and to issue bonds to any amount
authorized by law for the purpose
of securing funds ror incorpora
tion purposes and to secure the
payment of the same by mort
gaging property.
Stockholders Must bo Good.
The board may, when it deems it
to the best Interests of the corpora
tion, buy ail the stock of any stock
holder by paying him the face value,
accmnulateil dividendsand profits, to
gether' with a ten percent premium,
and- such-stockholder shall therefrom
cease to have any further interest in
the corporation.
The articles provide that an execu
ti'ce committee of three members may
have all the power and discharge all
the duties of the board of directors.
Ten thousand shares in the sum of
$100 each may be issued, and no sin
gle stockholder may hold more than
ten shares or have more than one
vote.
Board of Directors.
The board of directors is composed
of F. B. Wood of Fargo, president and
general manager C. O. Swenson of
Northwood, secretary treasurer P. A.
Suhumski, Lisbon William Olson,
Valley City William Maxwell, Con
way George White, Kramer C. A.
Swanson. Driscoll A. C- Townley,

incorporators are F. B. Wood, L. L.
Griffith of Lignite William Olson of
Valley City, and C. O. Swenson of
North Vood.
To Take up Farm Mortgages.
One of the purposes of the organiza
tion Is stated to be the taking up of
mortgaged lands, notes, etc., held
against members, and the extension to
these members of such credit as they
may require for the redemption of
their lands, or other property- Where
necessary, it is stated, the exchange
will buy lands at forced sales and
hold the same until the owners may
redeem them. The exchange will also,
It Is rumored, actively engage in the
organization of rural loan associations
to operate in connection with the fed'
eral farm loan bank in this district.

Washington, Oct 21.—The Dutch

up on the high seas August SO by a
British war vessel and all her mall
taken off, according to advices reach

The convention approved a plan of
pensions for the clergy, adopting a
plan whereby each parish in the
church is taxed for the support of
the pension fund 7.46 per cent of the
annual Balary paid its pastor. The
plan, as adopted, provides for clergy
men who have reached the age of 68,
a minimum pension of $600, one-half
the average annual salary of the
clergy and for a maximum of $2,000
yearly. It was stated that there are
5,814 clergymen in the church- who
will profit by the plan, providing the
initial $5,000,000 for the support of
the fund is raised- Bishop William
Lawrence of Massachusetts announc
ed that two- thirds of this amount
has been obtained.
Urging that without affiliating itself
with any "political scheme" the
church take a large interest in the
work of improving the masses, three
leaders said that by such action the
great mass of laboring people "many
of whom have been estranged, can be
won back to the church.
Right Rev.' Edwin S. Lines, bishop
of Newark, (N. J.), said: "It Is a
great mistake to bind the fortunes of
the church with the privileged class
es.
"There are many men who tell me
they are opposed to so many move
ments in the church, but that is only
because they oppose movements of
any kind. TheTe are some of our
clergy and indeed men outside of the
church who during times of great In
dustrial strife, use very strong lang
uage. But these men are prophets
of the new social order and the
prophetlQc fervor Hus always express
ed itself in strbhg language. They
are a little ahek'd' of the procession,
but they are le&dlrig in tbe direction
we must all take'.
Right, Rev. W- A.' Guerry, bishop of
South Carolina, said: "We know that
the church is doing more than ever
before for the working class. "We
should endeavor' to' bring about legis
lation to every man' the just reward
of his laborB. Tri such a way are we
going to win 'back' to the'church the
estranged and separated masses.
"To the great body of laboring peo
ple in this country, the church rep
resents privilege and is the enemy of
progress. We know, that this Is not
a true Indictment of the Christian
church. We must let the church
stand forth equally as the church of
the rich and the. poor.
"The service of .Christianity must
be social service. Right Rev. C. B.
Brewster, bishop of Connecticut told
the delegates.
"The increasing interest in social
service Is evidence of the pressure of
the finger of God upon human life,"
he said.
"God is preparing a new world
Shame on us, as a church if we fail
always to be on the side of social jus
tice."

New Tork, Oct. 21.—Railroads of
the United States are suffering from
the greatest shortage of cars ever ex
penenced at this time of year, accord- I
ing to figures made public today. On
September 2( there was a net-shortage
of 61,030 cars. This compares with
a surplus of 131,027 cars on Oct. 1.
1914, and on the correspond
ing date last year. The greatest short
age Is in box cars, totalling 38.016,
while coal and gondola cars are lack
ing to the extent of 19,872.
Traffic complications on a mam-
try, have produced a car shortage
throughout th northwest which Is
estimated at 10.000 cars. The. short
age* not only exists now, but it is grow
ing daily, and shippers of the north
west are greatly worried over its ulti
mate effect on business.
Four roatfs entering this state are
affects J, the Great Northern, North
ern- I'aclflc, the Soo and Milwaukee.
General prosperity and the lack of
sliips is credited as being the cause
of the condition. The destruction of
the northwest's wheat crop by rust
has caused immense shipments to be
made from Washington and Oregon
—grain that heretofore has gone by
water. The shortage for cars is caus
ed in part by the Impetus given the
lumber business, the biggest ship*
ments of automobiles in the history
pf. the courttry, and'the tremendous
demand for coal—dealers all over the
count™ uniting in an effort to get a

MEXICAN-AMERICAN JOINT
COMMISSION TAKES RECESS
Atlantic City. N. J., Oct. 21.—A re
cess until next Wednesday was taken
by the -Mexican-American joint com
mission. During this period Luis Ca
breara, head of the Mexican repre
sentatives expects to confer with Am
bassador designate Arredondo.
"The inability of railroads east of
Chicago to unload their cars is the
biggeet factor of the situation," said
Dispatcher L. M. Davis of the Great
Northern here in an Interview today.
"The general public hardly realizes
the number of items that contribute
to the shortage situation. While it lias
had its effect to some extent on the
Dakota division, so far we have suc
ceeded in keeping the shortage to a
minimum. Other roads have not been
so fortunate. The Dakota division
lent shape for demands being made
upon it, and we are not experiencing
anv complaints from shippers."
Coal .men, too, have their worries.
This season, probably to a greater ex
tent than ever before, wood will be
used as fuel in Grand Forks, accord
ing to A. G. Sorlie of this city. "At
present there is a coal shortage at
the Great Lakes docks of between
800,000 and 400.000 tons below that
available at the same period last year.
Reluctance of lake transportation
companies to accept coal shipments
in view of the higher freight rates
obtainable for copper, other metals
and war necessaries is th* eause. The
shortage will be fejt all over the
northwest, but principally In the
smaller towns. Locally, the condition,
while not entirely relieved, is better
than was at first anticipated, btit all
danger woutd be entirely relieved if
consumers would realise-the import
ance of placing their orders now and
allowing dealerf to empty and refill
