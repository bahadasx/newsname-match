"THE SHEPHERD '
OF THE HILLS."
''The Shepherd of the Hills,"
which comes to the Elks Theatre
Saturday, November 11 , is a dra
matizatiou of Haiold Bell Wright's
uovel, the dramatization having
been made by Mr. Wright and
Elsbery W. Reynolds.
"The Shepherd of the Hills'' is
an intensely spell-binding story of
love, mystery and heroic daring;
it gets a grip on life and brings
peace to the soul of any man or
woman who reads it.
The woodN and hills are part of
God's handiwork. They will give
peace aud strength to all who
seek them. From this play yon
may, in some measure, feel theii
influence and know some of the
ways of divine providence.
Yon will ask of this story, ''An
the characters in the play real
people? Does the obi 'shepherd'
live only in the pages of the book
or on the stage? Is there a ' 8 am.
my Lane' and a 'Young Matt'?
You will say they are all very
familiar, aud you seem somehow
to have known them a long time.
I he scenes may seem new and yet
old. If«you go to the Uztrk hills,
you will find somewhere a ship
ranch in "Mutton Hollow" and
a "Dewey Ball." But it is from a
log house above the mists that
you will view these hills and for.
