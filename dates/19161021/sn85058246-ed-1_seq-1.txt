1' HOW REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS KEPT
, -OS -OUT OF WAR
THE " DEWEY" IN 48 HOURS" ULTIMATUM.
i
) Abraham Lincoln and Wm. Mc-
Klnlcy. two Republican war presi
dents preserved the 'honor ot the
United States and won victories for
the American army and navy. A
long Hno ot nepubllcan presidents
have kept us' "out of war, among
which was the great American Tho
odoro Uoosovelt. Theodoro Roose
vclt Is supporting Governor Hughes
for the presidency with all his
might and main. Tho Wilson sup
porters claim that Theodoro Rooso
velt Is a man of war and that In case
of the election of Governor Hughes he
would urge him to conduct a war pol
icy. Such paltry balderdash tho Amer
ican peoplo will not condono for
they know too well that Roosovolt
and Hughes are men of pcaco and
that they know how to secure peace
) with honor.
Tho accusation that Theodoro
Roosevelt Is a. man of war is as far
from the truth as It Is posslblo to
) bo. Tho facts are, his record and
administration shows 100. per cent
perfect for peace
During tho sovqn and ono-half
years that lie waB president he pur
rued one Invnrlablo and consistent
foreign policy; a policy of interna
1 tlonal good-will and consideration
for the rights of others, and at
tho samo time of steady prepared
ness. During his seven and a half
years InAtho White House not an
AmericaWVrlfle was fired In war.
Ye, there were no less than sev-
1 on occasions when a presidential dl-
r plomacy Just a shado less firm, Just
a word less friendly, Just a thought
'5lk less wise, might have produced
If war. l
Seven critical occasions they wore.
1 Today wo see their full signifi
cance, and tremble nt what we es
caped. Dut at tho time each affair
was handlod so astutely by Rocso
velt that the danger was scarcely
realized outside ot his cabinet. In
deed, tho very means Roocovelt
then omployed to escape tho 'nngcr
. wero bitterly criticised by many
' who !aw nothing of the menace,
which, for the sake ot peace, ho kept
out ot public discussion.
Hero Is tho record a peace vic
tory a year, won by astuto diplomacy.
: Great Britain.
Tho first was with Groat Britain.
Thoro was a blttor dispute about tho
boundary of Alaska. After tho Klon
dike boom the Canadians realized
the valuo ot tho strip of coast runn
ing south. They revived a claim am
biguity In tho original treaty of 1825
between Russia and Groat Britain,
teclarlng that that coast should be
long to Cannda. Tho claim was nb
surd. Great Dritaln offered to ar
bitrate. Ilooeovolt refused because
our title was so sound, and arbit
rators llko to compromise.
Horo wore tho makings of trouble
If Roosevelt had lot Congress .nnd
' tho press got Into discussion, it is'
easy to see how public anger would
havo blazed ,up, both horo and in
Great Uritaln, and tho British would
have had to humiliate themsolves or
ilso light.
Hut Instead, noosovelt cloverly
gavo tho 'British a chanco to turn
down their own clnlm and koop tholr
irldo. Ho proposod a Joint Com
1'ilsslon, threo Americans nnd three
British, thus leaving tho matter to
the conscientious Justlco of both par
ties. At tho samo tlmo Roosovolt
J sent troops to occupy tho dlsputod
. reclon.
Whon in 1003 tho Joint Commis
sion gavojts decision, tho Lord Chief
Juatlco of England, who was ono of
the British mombors, had voted with
tho Amorlcans tho two Canadians
JJ members sticking by their claim.
1 Thus Roosovolt avoldod nil peril
of angry publjo discussion, with its
J hot and unWrglvnblo words which
J would havo ralsod tho warllko issuo
ot "national honor," Ho avortod
the mischancos of a third purty nr
hltrallon. Ho gavo jtho British a
noblo chanco to withdraw tholr
claim, , j
He produced peace, fostered I
friendship and kept tho Alaskan
strip. , . , i .
Germany.
Tho second occasion was with
Germany.
' Venezuoln had defaulted Its pay-'
ments to German and other Europ
ean creditors. Under Germany's
leadership Venezuela was blockaded
and a threat was mado to bombard'
its tiorts anil nrnttnv Itq rnnst.
Roosevelt was watching, but not
waiting too long. Ho (announced
our stand on tho Monroe Doctrlno:
"Wo do not guarantee any state
against punishment If It misconducts
Itself, provided the punishment does
not tako the form ot an acquisition
of territory by any non-American
power."
Gerniany professed sho had no
such Intentions at least no "per
manent acquisition." Sho felt free
to mako a "temporary" acquisition.
But Roosovelt- knew how temporary
acquisitions by European powers
soon become permanent. So ho ask
ed, through tho German Ambassa
dor, Dr. Holleben, tho Emperor's
consent to arbitration. It was re
fuscu. Finally, Roosovelt told tho Ger
man Ambassador that If he didn't
recelvo tho Emperor's consent In ten
days he would order Admiral Dew
oy, then south of Cuba', to take his
ffoot,t oVcnezuola to prevent foreign
landing.
A week passed. The German Am
bassador Bald no consent had come.
He was suro none would come.
Roosovelt remarked tot him, pleas
antly: "Then there's no uso in Dew
ey's waiting, tho full ten days. If
the nssuranco doesn't come In 48
hours, Dowey will sail."
It came (lnv36 hours), and Dew
ey didn't, sail. But tho Emperor po
Utoly askod Roosovolt to bocomo ho
arbitrator In the disputo with Vene
zuela. Roosovelt declined tho honor
turning tho business over to Tho Ha
gue Court of Arbitration.
Roosevelt publicly applauded the
Emperor's magnanimity In the cause
of ponce; and for tho sake of good
feooling kopt sagaciously silent ab
out tho Inner facts. Theso wero not
known to the public till years after
wards whon tho Life of Secretary
Hay was published.
At the tlmo, Roosovelt simply an
nounced to Congress that Instead ot
accoptlng this courteous Invitation
to bo tho arbotrator, ho had consid
ered .It "an admirable opportunity
to advanco tho practice of a peace
ful settlement of disputes between
nations, nnd to socuro for Tho Ha
guo tribunal a memorable lncrcaso
of Its practical Importance."
It was a masterly escapo from
wnr. Another kind of president
would lmov kopt Bonding notes till
Germany had occupied and fortified
tho torrltory. Then to dislodge her,
In defense of tho Monroe. Doutrino,
wo would havo been In for an ng
grosslvo and dubious war. But In
stead of continuous correspondence,
recorded nnd glvon to tho press,
Roosevelt sent 'ono qulot, verbal and
prlvato "Dowoy-ln-48-hours" ulti
matum, Charles E. Hughes will follow tho
Bamo American policy.

THE KING ADDRESS
AT NIBLEY HALL
WEDNESDAY NIGHT
Judgo King who Is quite as good an
orator as W. J. Bryan and Is as cor
rect In his English and phraseology
as President Woodrow Wilson, mado
a" dramatic and mournful plea for
support of tho party Wednesday
.nlght. Saying: "If my purty l not
tho party of progress and humaJ.
rights I do not ask you to voto
'or It." The Judge evidently torgof
'Vera Cruz, Columbus, and Car
rizal, whore human rights suffered
oxcruclatingly through tho ravishing
peaco policy of tho administration.
Judgo King referred to a statement
that Senator Smoot had charged,
President Wilson as being a ' broken
down University Professor," and was
followed by Milton elllng of Box
Elder who said the destiny ot this
great Republic is directed by Divine
Provldcnco, and tho Lor was rpon
siblo for tho election of Woodrow
Wilson. The crowd wondered at
this, as all fair-minded people had
credited this blunder to Theodore
Roosovolt and this was tho flrr.t time
It had heard Teddy bo compared.
After all both addresses wore Wll
sonlan in that they were words,
words, words. To that part of
Judge King's address in t'.o matter
of Senator Smoot's reference to
Woodrow Wilson nnd his professor
ship. Brigham II. Roberts has also
attempted to magnify it, and in order
that the facts may be known the fol
lowing from the Herald Republican
is submitted:
It is Immaterial whetehr Senator,
Smoot claims that he was or was
not misrepresented. Nor is It great
ly material that tho Doseret News
was grossly mistaken when It said
that Senator Smoot "characterized
President Woodrow Wilson as a bro
ken down university professor."
What Senator Smoot said waB that,
at tho tlmo Mr. Wilson was Inveigh
ing against labor and defending cap
itnl, ho wns seeking "as a broken
down university professor" to obtain
a pension from the Carneglo fund
which hnd been sot aside for pen
sions for "broken down university
professors." It would have been In
finitely moro to Mr. Wilson's credit
had he beon a "broken down univer
sity professor" nt tho tlmo ho made
this application than that he should
havo been, as he was, an educator
In tho prlmo of life, quite able to
make a living for himself and his
family. Had ho been n "broken
down university professor" his ac
tion in seeking a Carneglo pension
would havo boon Justifiable Slnco
he was not a "broken down univer
sity professor," ho was not Justified
.In seeking this pension, which was
I precisely what Senntor Smoot was
.seeking to omphaslzo.
Tho point is, and it Is a point
that Senator Smoot quite clearly
made, however grossly it was garbl
ed by Inefficient reporters, that Pres
ident Wilson was attempting to rep
resent himself as something ho was
not in order to enjoy emoluments tn
which he was not clearly ontitlcd.
Thnt ho did so attempt Is a matter
ot record and not to bo dlsputqd.
No dofender of tho Prosldont will
seok to disputo it If ho has any sense
of responsibility nnd is discussing
tho matter at any place whoro tho
facts aro known.
Thoso who heard tho address of
Senator Smoot to tho candidates ot
tho Republican party at tho Commer
cial club, of which B. II. Roberts,
with his characteristic sophistry is
seeking to tako advantago, know
qulto woll thoro is no "innuendo"
In what Senator Smoot said. Ho
was discussing tho candidate of tho
Domocratlc party for President of
tho United States With tho firmness
nnd forcof ulnosa for which ho is well
known and in unequivocal language
to which nono can tako exception,
stating facts nono can dispute.
Will Mr. Roborts, or somo other
spellbinder of tho Domocratlc party,
equall) reckless of tho facta and tho
bounds of propriety, seok to deny
thnt Woodrow Wilson represented
himself to bo a "brokon down uni
versity professor." and asked for a
ponslon from tho Carneglo fund up
on that basis, tho only b'asls upon
which ho might seek such a penslot,
Will any orator of tho Democratic
party. B. II. Roberts' or somobody
olso, seek to deny that Mr. Wilson
wns virulent1- against labor at that

FORMER DEMOCRAT TURNS fl
TABLES ON JUDGE KING
Roy, Oct. 17.' Roy residents aro
still discussing a campaign Incident
that took placo hero Saturday night
In tho course of a speech by V.
II, King, Domocratlc nqmlnoo for tho
United Stntos Senate, which Incident i
Invariably brings a smllo to tho faces
of thoso who recall how II. II. Mac-1
Mlllan, former president of tho Utah '
State Bar association turned the ta
bles on Mr. King.
Mr. King was expounding Demo
cratic principles whon Mr. MncMll
lan nnd E. Conway Ashton, who
chanced to bo In town, stopped In nt
tho meeting. Mr. King saw them.
"I seo two of my distinguished
Republican friends In tho audience,"
romarked Mr. King. "1 am glad
they aro horo that they may hear
somo political truths. One of my Re
publican friends was onco n Demo
crat but switched to tho Republican
party.
"Will you permit mo to tell theBo
good peoplo why I changed from a
Democrat to a Republican?" nsked
Mr. MacMlllan of Mr. King.'
"No," shouted Mr. King with om
phnsfs, and resumed his talk on cam
paign Issues.
Whon tho Incident was callod to
Mr. MacMlllan's attention last night
ho vouched for Its authenticity.
Asked what ho would havo said If
Mr. King had permitted him to tell
his reasons for becoming a Republi
can to tho Roy audience, Mr. Mac
Mlllan said:
"If I had been permitted to make
a statomont thero I would havo said
first that a Democrat should botho
last ono to challenge nny man for
changing his mind. A Democrat can
say nothing concerning his mind on
politics or public questions, for If
ho did ho could not bo a supporter ot
President Wilson, who has changed
his mind upou every public question
dlnco his Inauguration and tflion tho
principles affecting public question.
Principal Difference.
"Tho 'principal dlfferonco between
tho Republican party and tho Demo
cratic party slnco tho quostlon of
slavery was settled has been tho tar
iff. It was argued by tho Demo
crats that n high protectlvo tariff
was tho creator ot trusts and unlaw
ful combinations In restraint ot
trade The Republican party under
tho leadership of that great Amer
ican, Theodoro Roosevelt, from 1901
to 1908, took every slop necessary
to prevent tho unlawful formation
of combinations and trusts. Through
tho great work of tho Republican
party protection has beon oxtendod
tn lint li canitnl nnd lnlinr.
"In 1008 tho Republicans declar
ed for revision of the tariff. Tho
platform of tho party declared for
protection of capital and labor by
tho Imposition ot duties equnl to tho
dlfferonco of tho cost of production
abroad nnd at home, nnd for giving
a reasonable profit to American In
dustries through such a tariff. This
met tho situation squa'rely. It kept
tho industries of tho country going
nnd created a domand for labor, the
opportunity to labor being tho basis
of prosperity. Tho Republic in plat
form of that year meets my Ideas
exactly.
"I bellovo thnt tho Republicans
wore right In tholr principle of tho,
ship subsidy, which would havo rlv
cnt ot this count! y a merchant mar
ine "In fact tho Republican platform
ot 1108 tells ot the storj' of wny
men should change from Dorcccrats
to Republicans I quote nav from
In experience the difference be
tween Democracy nnd Republican
Ism Is thnt tho ono moans adversity
I whllo tho other means prosperity.
One means low wages, tho other
means high wages. Ono means
doubt and dobt, the other moans
.confidence nnd thrift.
In principle tho dlfferonco be
tween Democracy and Republican
ism Is that ono stands for vacilla
tion and timidity In government, tho
oilier for strength and purposo. Ono
promlsos, tho other reforms. Ono
finds fault, .tho other finds work.
Tho present tendencies 'of the two
parties aro moro marked by Inherent
dfferoncos. Tho trend ot Democra
cy Is toward socialism, whllo tho Re
publican party stands for wlso and
and rgulatod Individualism. Soc
ialism, woujd destroy wealth, Repub-
...
llcnnlsm would prevent Us abuse 0
Socialism would give to each an eq- V
ual right to tako, Republicanism ' H
to earn. R'lnl'sm would offer and i l
would glvo to each and equal rlgh? 1
equality of position, wlilch .would '' jH
soon leave no ono anything to pos- .,
soss. Republicanism would' glvo iH
equality to each', It would assure to '.
each his sharo of the constantly In- j ;H
creasing sum ot possession. -
In lino with this tomlency, the ' H
Democratic party today believes In !''l
government ownership, whllo the ) H
Republican party bollevcs In gov- ( jH
ornniont legislation. Ultimately jtH
