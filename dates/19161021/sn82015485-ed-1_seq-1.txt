MARKET REPORT
C. W. MILLER FOR STATE SENATOR
C. W. Miller, candidate for senator
from the 39th senatorial district, has
been a resident of -Ellis county for
thirty years. Like many of the early
settlers of this country Mr. Miller
started with practically nothing but
by honest, industrious and temperate
habits he has become one of the pros
perous citizens of that county. Dur
ing his long residence there he has
won the confidence and esteem of all
and his life has been remarkably
clean and ' worthy one. He is a man
. who has a fund of information hav
iog been a great reader and is well
"qualified to take the part in the af
fairs of state that this important po
sition calls for. Let the voters stop
And think and they will remember
that it has been over twenty years
since this part of the district has had
a senator and we believe they will all
agree that it is time this locality is
being recognized, therefore let us ral
ly to the support of Mr. Miller and
give him a vote that will carry him
safely into the position for which he
is making the race and for which he
is capable of filling so well that of
senator from the o9ih district.
Carol!
Last Wednesday morning
Kelly and Neil Uftord returned home
after several months at the Mexican
border. They were mustered out of
Company M First Kansas Regiment
at Fort Riley the first of the week
The boys were glad to be home once
more and their friends were glad to
see them again. They look very sol
-dierly in their VJ. S. A. khaki uni
forms, but they say it takes more
tha.n a. uniform to make a soldier es
pecially the kind to fight the Mexi-
. cans.
KLINE'S ANSWER VERY WEAK
Last week H. F. Kline comes out
in a very weak evasive article and
dodges the whole issue. He says the
matter is based on a personal feeling
on the part of the editor of this pa
per which is not the truth. - What
ever feeling in a personal .way exists
this matter is based as we were care
ful to state before entirely and whol
ly on 'one issue and that is a political
one Republicanism..' Kline would
not take his stand and without it we
refused to bead our ticket with bis
name. He is just as good a Republi
can now as be was- before he wrote
last week's article which is not at all.
He is against Hughes, Capper and
Benton on good authority this is
said of him. Our readers will notice
that in his article he explains noth
ing and especially they will notice
that he does not explain why he sold
his paper to a Democrat on the eve of
election or why he took no part in
the Republican rally when O. L. Ben
ton was here a few weeks ago.. The
people see through it plainly no mat
ter what he says at heart be is not a
Republican and is not giving the par
ty his loyal support and never has.

THAT WORD LOYALTY
Let us consider that word -loyalty
loyalty to tne old home town.
be loyal is to be faithful to a mena,
a cause or a principle. To be loyal is
to be true. But, in business in
spending money loyalty does not
mean that you should buy something
you do not want, or something you
do not need. It does not mean that
you should accept an article of infer
ior quality, or, that you should pay
two prices. It does not mean that
you should trade - with a merchant
simply because he happens to be in
business in your town. It does not
mean that you should sell your labor
or that which you produce for less
than the market price. Loyalty
means the golden rule to do unto
others as vou would have others do
unto you.' It means to give your
home merchant the first chance ' at
your business to give him a chance
to fill your orders on the same terms
the city concern offers. It means go
ing to your neighbor and saying "Mr.
Merchant, I am a resident - of this
community. I want to do all I can
do to lielp the town, and if you can
do as well by me as the city -concern
Quality " and price considered. I am
going to give you my patronage.
When you have done this, you have
done your part. .That's business loy
alty loyalty in the strict meaning of
the word. But usually the loyal
citizen does not stop merely at giv
ing the lionie merchants chance at
his business. Be gives the word loy
alty a broader meaning. He takes a
general interest in his neighbors in
their social life.. He belongs to
lodge or two he is in the church
and he has a finger in every good
thing that is proposed to make bis
home . town a better town. - lie is
broad, generous, open hearted. And,
be "possesses these splendid qualities
because -he is loyal.
