TO REBUILD MEXICO.
Republio Planning Rehabilitation of/In
dustries Whan Peace Comes.
Juares, Mexico, Oct. 21. Mexico
plans to rebuild her revolution-shat
tered Industries upon a firm founda
tion. With the restoration of peace In
the republic the thousands of factories,
mills, shops and stores which have been
burned, wrecked or partially destroyed
by artillery fire or by the work of the
bombing crew which are always a part
of a Mexican army In the field, are to
be rebuilt.
The representative of a large Pa
cific coast cement manufacturing com
pany recently visited Andres Garcia,
Inspector general-of consulates for the
Carrsnza government and Gen. Fran
cisco Gonzales, commander of the
Juares garrison, and consulted with
them regarding the erection of a
11,000,000 cement plant in Juares. to
utilise the great shale beds which are
to be found at the foot of the Juares
mountains. This'material has been
tested and found to be 'good for ce
ment making. The supply is said by
experts to be Inexhaustible and th*
shale beds are located near enough to
the railroad to make haulage costs low.
The representative of the American
cement company is being given every
encouragement by the Carransa offi
cials. They realize the importance of
having such a plant on the border
where its product can be shipped to all
points in the Interior at a low cost.
While many of the buildings In Mex
ico are built of adobe, the larger build
ings are made of brick and stone, con
crete having been little used in con
struction work in the Interior because
of the comparative scarcity of cement
With the construction of a plant to
manufacture cement here,-many Mex
ican laborers who are now forced to go
to the United-States in search of em?
ployment will be employed 4nd, be
cause of the lower cost of labor Jn this
"country, it will be possible to sell the
finished product of the plant at a much
lower rate than that prevailing In the
United States, the promoters say.

Vj
Peace Advoeates Cite Peaceful Rela
tions Between United States and
Canada as Argument In Paver of
What World Nations Might Ao*
compllsh by Mutual Agreements-*
Seen as Possibility at Cloae of Wais
St. Louis, Oot. 21.—The establish
ment of a mutual, agreement among
the nations of the western hemisphere,
similar to the non-armament agree
ment between the United -States and
Canada, is urged in a report to the
house of deputies of the Protestant
ISpiscopal convention by a committee
headed by Rev. Henry Lubeok, of
New York. In the report It Is saM:
"By agreement armament on the
great lakes has been limited and tha
border has been unfortified for 100
years and our relations with our
northern neighbors are increasingly
cordial. We are a part of a Pan
American union with our Latin Ameri
can nelghbore. This extends the co
operate idea over the whole western
hemisphere and makes for pence.
These are practical suggestions for the
organization of mankind In the Inter
ests of the normal condition of peace.'*
The oommlttee said a similar agree
ment on the part of European nations
was a possibility. Delegates to the
general convention and the women's
auxiliary were guests Mils afternoon
