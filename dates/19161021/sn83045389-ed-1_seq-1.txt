Bryan. The former Secretary of Stale,
who left the President's <*al?iftet be

met, each smiled broadly as they shook
hands. Mr. Bryan said Vhat he would
ride in the President's train for a
short distance in order to get into Mr.

KAN" ANTONIO, TEX.. October 20.?
American troops and Mexicans clashed
near San Jose, in the Big Bend coun
try. yesterday afternoon, according to
a report received by General Funston
early to-night from Colonel Joseph
Gaston, t commander of the district.
The fight lasted for forty-five minutes.
No losses were suffered by the Ameri
cans, and information is lacking re
garding loss among the Mexicans.
Colonel Gaston's report said that a
hand of about thirty Mexicans opened
fire on a detachment composed of
twenty-three men of the Sixth Cavalry
and Texas National Guard Cavalry
Squadron, engaged in patrol duty be
tween l'residio and Ttuidosa. Lieu
tenant Cudington, of the Texas squad*-,
ron. commanding the troops, ordered
his men to return the lire.
A vigorous exchange of shots con
tinued for a period of forty-live
minutes, the Americans and Mexicans
tiring in skirmish formation from cov
ered positions on either side of the Rio
Grande. Information from Colonel
Gaston did not indicate that the United
States troops crossed in pursuit of the
Mexicans. After the fight. Lieutenant
Cudington returned to Ruidosa with
his command.
Whether the Mexicans were de facto
government troops or members of a
bandit band was not known by General
Funston to-night.
Colonel Gaston reported that Major
Anderson, of the Sixth Cavalry, has
gone to San Jose to investigate the in
cident, as has Colonel Riojos, com
mander of thfe Carranza garrison at

said, "that Russia is out of Joint, is
half-bankrupt, is starving', and will be
ready for a separate peace before

people would welcome it to-day.
"It is thi- old Bismarckian tradition
that Germany ouuht to be the friend
of Russia, and that such an alliance
would be her surest protection.
"If we really "Want to bring peace

to lirina: Germany and Kngland to an
understanding before Germany and
Russia have made peace and formed
an alliance. Neither the English nor
the German people want this peace
to-day. but they ouuht to want it, for,
once the new alliance is formed, it
will seek to crush the ambition of
England for world power.
"Some neutral groups in Europe are
seeking to bring about this under

submitted to such treatment.
Great Britain some time ago extend
ed her censorship to vessils plying in
the Far East, but so far as is known
never before has seized mail outside
