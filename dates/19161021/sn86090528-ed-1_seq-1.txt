Vice-Pres. and Miss Griffefh Sec-Treas
The closing sessions of the annual
convention of the Grady County Teach
ers association are being held in
Chickasha today, concluding one of
the most profitable and interesting
meetings ever held by that associa
tion. Until the very last interest has
been sustained and the scores of coun
ty teachers who have been in regular
attendance have felt amply repaid for
their fidelity.
Morning Session.
The numbers on the program yes
terday morning were all strong ones,
calculated to Inspire the instructors
to greater and nobler effort. Distin
guished visitors In the parsons of
President Grant B. Crumbine of the
Central State Normal and Miss Helen
Caporton of Oklahoma City and Dallas
who has gained distinctiou in prima
ry work, commanded tho undivided atr
tentlon of their audience as did avio
tho local speakers, O. C. Cooper, coun
ty agent, on what our schools can do
in the organization of, boys and girls
clubs and Miss Anna Smith of the Ok
lahoma College for Womeu who spoke
on the relation of art to the needs of
the rural and village teacher.
President Grumbine's Address.
President Grumhlue delivered a
forceful address in which he spoke of
the qualifications of a good teacher
In part as follows:
"The teacher to be a good citizen
must be a qualified teacher. - On the
child, whether It lives until ten or
twenty or longer, its influence goes on
and on and there is no telling when it
will end.
Tho teacher must be trained. You
can't afford to experiment. The teach
er spends more time with the pupil
than with the parent. The require
ments should be increased" instead of
leveling "it The teacher Is our com
munity assistant.
"Too many teachers only go Into
the work at 8:30 o'clock in the morn
ing and quit at 4 o'clock in the after
noon ami take a few minute-; r.t tho
end of the month to draw their pay
check. i -
"You must study the child. You
must inspire the child to Bucceed and
to grow. You can do it by community
service, influencing the home, by
knowing something of the child's life.
The child needs sympathy. So many
parents are opposed to the child being
educated.
"The boys and girls should be in
terested in canning clubs, etc. The
teacher should co-operate with the A.
& M. You should be interested in gar
dening. You must live with your peo
ple. You must be a social factor in
your community. The teachers must
work for civic improvements, for the
child" who is raised in beautiful sur
roundings becomes a better boy or
girl than one who does not. In rela
tion to the religion or christian move
ments In the community. Every
teacher should be a member of some
religious or christian organization in
order to do good teaching. It you do
these things you will be the teacher
that Is a success, the one In demand.
In order to make a success the main
thing is 'stick.' ''
Miss Caperton's Advice.
One of the mot interesting events
of the meeting was the address on pri
mary work which was made by Miss
Caperton. Prefacing her copiously il
lustrated dissertation with the quota
tion from G. Stanley Hall, the educa
tor, "When unhealthy bodies, mis
chievous tendencies, dull mental pow
ers and divers and sundry kinds of
wrong doing are present in the school
room it is safe to say that monotony
or repression of expression is a com

launched into the following topics on

Breaking down in a succession of
loud sobs and moans, "Dutch" 11. A.
Smith, when arraigned on the charge
o Unlawful whiskey selling, pleaded
in Judge Davenport's court yesterday
afternoon to be given a chance to
leave the city Vast night in lieu of go
ing to jail. "I have spent seven years
of my life working for John Tinker
and this is what it has brought me
to"" Jie said, adding, "at the age of
sixty when 1 am not fit for any other
kind) of work." But tho officers had
spent too much time Investigating the
Tucker home, four miles from Chick
asha, and its operations to give heed
to the waHs of the unfortunate man.
Dutch Smith was given a fine of
$100 and ninety days in jail together
with all court costs. "Just give me,
one more chance," he pleaded. "Turn
me loose and I will leave tho state to
night and never come back."
But it wai too late. It is alleged he
has made similar p e and promises
before and at the time of the arrest of
John Tucker some time ago when the
latter agreed to and did leave the
state and went to Wichita Falls, Tex
as, where he now resides, Dutch

time has been flitting back and forth.
"I- stayed in Wichita Falls for a
while,'' he moaned, "but John Tucker
sent me back because ho said ho could
not afford to keep me down there."
Dutch Smith was returned to jail' to
serve his ninety days. He was arrest
ed by Bob Castleman on the Tucker
farm as a result of the court of inqui
ry which had been instituted in the
county court at the intsance of Counly
Attorney Venable and which is prom

QUARREL
Rock Island Riptrack Man Placed Under
$50G Bond to Keep Peace and to
Appear before District Court
John Kelly, riptrack man In the Rock
Island yards, was released from jail
today on a peace and appearance bond
furnished by his brother who arrived
this morning from Pauls Valley.
This bond was required by Judge
Moore after the preliminary hearing
given Kelly on the charge ot threat
ening to beat, kill, shoot and other
wise to harm Mrs. John Dean, his
mother-in-law and Mrs. John Kelly, his
wife, and with threatening to blow up
the home ot his niotlier-In-Iaw with
dynamite. ,
Last spring Kelly pleaded guilty to
the charge of wife beating In Judge
Moore's court. He was arrested , on
the charge of assault and battery ear
ly in the week by ,city police and his
trial is set for the 28th intt., in the
city court, being released on a $25
bond.
The testimony at the examining trial
in Judge Moore's' court showed that
the latest row occurred over the price
of the grocery bilL which was $17 for
the first half month. Mrs. Kelly de
clared there was no use fussing about
a grocery bill and that if he would
not pay it her cousin would. That
started something but Kelly and his
wife disagreed over the details of it.
Mrs. Kelly declared that her husband
struck her a vicious block back of the
ear and then choked her. "He tried to
smother me," she said. Kelly denies
this and asserts that Mrs. Kelly start
ed after him with a hammer and in
order to protect himself he was forced
to scuffle with her with the result that
she fell, striking her head on a table.
Mrs. Kelly testiiied that he had
whipped her before. Mrs. Dean. Mrs.
Kelly's mother, testified that Kelly
had threatened to destroy her home
with dynamite.
Judge Moore, after hearing the evi
dence, decided to place Kell;' under
bond to keep the peace especially with
respect to that of the defendant's wile
and mother-in law and to appear be
fore the next term of the district court

With, their last year's defeat at the

Couch Reed's seemingly uneonquera

game waa clean from every point of
view and nono of the dirty tactics of
the old time "rough stuff" was at a..y
time in evidence. Both teams played
football and played it to a finish, us
ing the forward pass, trick plays and
straight football.
Although the two teams were pretty
evenly niatuhod, the local squad show
ed their superiority in speed
by breaking through the vis

whistle blew. The ball waa kept for
