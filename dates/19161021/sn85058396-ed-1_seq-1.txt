SHORTAGE OF COAL
IS NOW FEARED
Salt Lako, Oct 21. That Salt Lake
has prospects of facing one of the
moBt severe coal shortages this win
ter it has experienced In years is tho
declaration of local coal dealers.
Tho occasion, they oxplaln, is the
lack of cars, which the railroad com
panies need to handle the output of
tho mines. The coal men stato that
at the present time tho car shortage
situation ifi so serious that practically
all of the mines of the state are work
ing only threo to four days a week,
and some of them are not working
more than two days a week. At this
their output is moro than can be
handled by the railroads, it ia said.
In addition the mines are running
with about 60 per cent of tho men
that were employed a year ago be
cause of the lack of cars to movo the
output and because In the early part
of this year many miners went to
other scctionsc of the country, many
going into thoWinitions factories and
securing other employment that has
held them.
C. S. Martin of the C. S. Martin
Coal company stated last night that
from the best figures he had been
able to secure the mine operators are
now about 200,000 tons behind in de
livery of their orders in tho territory
supplied by the Utah mines.
"The situation in Salt Lake and
Utah is not serious as yet," said Mr.
Martin, "but should there ome a se
vere cold spell, or should we havo a
long and severe winter, the situation
in the city would become seriouB. At
present we have enough coal to about
meet the demand locally, but it is tho
territory outside of the state that is
suffering now. This condition will
come home to us here if there is a
severe cold spell.
"The only way to guard against this
is for local consumers to lay in their
supplies for the winter now as rapidly
as they can, so that they will have
coal on hand and will not be caught
by a shortage lator.
"Tho coal men have been urging
this right along and the consumers
have been putting in their supplies in
pretty good shape. But, as I said be
fore, should we have a long and se
vere winter the city has the prospect
of facing a most severe coal shortage."

BOOSTERS HAVE I
Mil IT THE
WEBER CLUB
Sixty-five reasons why Ogden Is the
most progressive city in the inter
mountain country held social com
munion last night at the Weber club.
They were, as A. P. BIgelow aptly put
it, the- representative young members
of the Weber club and, otherwise, the
men who made Ogdeu's 1916 Harvest
Festival and. Fashion Show a far
reaching success.
The occasion was tho long antici
pated jollification mooting of the
Fashion Show committees and after a
tasty four-course banquet, set on
tables decorated with bouquets of red
roses and ferns, had been disposed of
between toasts, an hour or moro was
passed in speech-making. John C.
Culley, chairman of the entertainment
committee, stated the purpose of the
gathering in a brief address of wel
come and Introduced the toastmaster
of the ovenlng, President Albert Scow
croft of the Harvest Festival and
Fashion Show association, as tho "big
gest little man in Utah."
While Mr. Culley's speech was be
ing made, a souvenir of the occasion,
a blank memorandum book bound in
red leather and bearing the Inscrip
tion, "What I know about Fashion
Shows and reasons why I should be
president," by Albert Scowcroft, was
presented to each of the banqueters
and, when opened, created much mer
riment All of the speakers, however,
declared that the Fashion Show presi
dent had been entirely too modest in
preparing the book and that the blank
pages in it would have been inade
quate to hold the story had it been
the work of a different author.
Mr. Scowcroft, after making humor
ous reference to the book, said that
it takes a long time sometimes to put
some things over, but that the time
he spent in working to make the Og
den 1916 Fashion Show a success had
been made pleasurable by association
with the most loyal crowd of assist
ants ho had ever known and by th
knowledge, that their work had at
tained the desired end. He then in
troduced President W. H. Wattls of
the Weber club, as "one who knows
all about construction and can tell
how to construct another Fashion
Show."
Mr. Wattls opening remarks were
confined to a fine tribute to the men
who had made the 1916 show tho best
ever held. President Scowcroft, he
said, had gotten together a great body
of workers and guided Its efforts with
splendid results. "There have been
no complaints heard of the 1916
show," ho continued, "and it is a fine
thing for Ogden that it should go
that way. It Is an augury of bigger
things for this community that will
also bo equally successful." Speaking
further, President Wattls said that
plans for the 1919 transportation ex
position wero starting out strong and
that a committee had been appointed
to take charge of the preliminary
work. "We must have the same inter
est In this show that we have had in
our Fashion Shows, and It will be
equally successful," ho said, "and we
must also keep our annual Fashion
Show going."
The other speakers, all of whom re
ferred to President Scowcroft as the
man in the right place in connection
with the Fashion Show, and detailed
different features of the show and Its
far-reaching benefits to Ogden, were
A. P. BIgelow, B. E. Bristol, Rev. J. E.
Carver, Miles L. Jones, Fred G. Tay
lor, Dr. Reinhold Kanzler, George M.
Glen, F. M. Drlggs, Arthur Kuhn, J. H.
Devlne and James P. Casey. They
also referred to the 1919 exposition
and declared that it would bring Og
den into prominence throughout the
world.

So ended tho football game played
at Cummings' field In Salt Lake City
yesterday and, for the first time since
1910, the Orange and Black waved
triumphantly above the Red and
Black. Revenge Is sweet an tho Og
den boys surely got It yesterday, as
they outplayed their heavier Salt
Lake opponents In every branch of
tho game and won the decisive vic
tory for which the home people have
been waiting and hoping for six long
years. Not since tho Ogden baseball
team beat out the Salt Lake team for
the championship of tho Union asso
ciation has the news of local success
in an athletic competition been re
ceived with such widespread joy as
the downfall of tho ancient rivals of
tho "Orange and Black" color bear
ers. The news was carried to the boost
er's banquet at tho Weber club last
night by Dr. Rhelnhold Kanzler, and
received as another convincing proof
that Ogden spirit, persistence and am
bition overcomes all obstacles. Dr.
Kanzler urged that tho boys be given
the support of all local citizens in
tho games that are soon to bo played
in Ogden and his remarkB were greet
ed with enthusiastic npplause.
Tho gamo was late In getting
started, duo to an unduly long con
ference between tho officials and
coacheB and tho long wait had Its ef
fect on tho Ogden team. It did not
strike its gait until the opening of
the second half. Outweighed nearly
ten pounds to tho man, tho Ogden
backfleld players dashed through the
Salt Lako line time after time, backed
up by such Interference as .even tho
Salt Lake sport writers conceded has
seldom been equaled by state high
school gridiron athletes.
In the first quarter, the Salt Lako
team played much the speedier game,
forcing tho ball to the Ogden 45-yard
ljne In the first five minutes of play.
From this point, Stiefel, star of the
Red and Black Bquad, put the ball
over tho bar with ono of the pretti
est drop klckB over seen, in a Utah
game. ThlB was the Panthers only
score, as the Ogden players put up a
good defense though they failed on
their offensive. The second quarter
found tho Tigers pounding tho line.
Falck was played with tho ball to the
Salt Lake 3-yard line and then Wilkin
son was sent over with the first
touchdown. Both teams then braced
and tho half ended with the ball in
the middle of the field.
The rest period was much longor
than necessary, due to another wran
gle among the officials and coaches
and tho players -wero nearly chilled
through when tho time for the second
half was finally called. At the sound
of the whistle, the Tigers started to
get warmed up in a hurry and a ox
hibMIon of team work such as has
not been witnessed at Cummings field
was staged within the next twenty
minutes. Both teaniB had previously
found end runB fruitless, so tho Tigers
now made their gains through fine
Interference and pounding the Salt
Lako line.
The first sensation of the half and
tho biggest of the day occurred when
Dee caught the ball on the Ogden 20
yard line and with his team-mates
forming an unbreakable wall around
him by Buperb interference, ran tho
remaining SO yards for a touchdown.
With the ball again in play, con
tinuous lino plunges by the Ogden
backfleld netted the team nearly 10
yards each time and the ball was soon
within Btriklug distance of the Pan
thers' goal. With no let-up of steam,
the Tigers seized their advantage and
Falck carried the ball over for tho
third touchdown. Falck kicked goal.
Rapidly lining up again, tho Orange
and Black eleven duplicated their pre
vious triumphal march down tho field
and this time Glasmann carried tho
ball over. Yet again the march was
staged and Ogden scored a third
touchdown from the 3-yard line. This
was not allowed, however, as the of
ficials decided that tho play had start
ed before the whistle had been blown
to put tho ball in action following the
previous down. The decision lost Og
den six more points as the team was
held for downs just before time was
called.
To give special credit to any of the
Ogden players would be an Injustice
to others, the consensus of opinion
of those who saw the contest, being
that Coach Raymond Shlrey and his
assistants have developed an all-star
high school team that is going to win
tho state championship.

Speaking this morning of yester
day's contest, Captain Fox of the Og
den eleven stated that the result was
no surprise to him as he had a good
lino on the Panthers' and knew his
team would bring back home tho ba
con. He also said ho was confident of
defeating the East Side Salt Lake
high school eleven next Saturday,
whon the two teams meet at Glen
wood, as tho Orange and Black eleven
now has unbounded confldenco in Its
ability to defeat any high school team
that Salt Lako can get together.

Stuergkh. H
London, Oct 21, 5 p. m. The pre-
mier of Austria has been shot. ftlH
Reuter's Amsterdam correspondent IFI
says the Austrian premier, Count Karl ftjl
Stuergkh, was shot today by the pub-
Usher of a Vienna newspaper named ill
Abler, according to a telegram recelv- Hl
ed at Amsterdam from Berlin. Wl
Count Stuergkh has been a promi-
nent figure in Austrian political af- B
fairs for years. He was minister of I
public works in the cabinet formed in ff
1909 at the retirement of which in Oc-
tober, 1911, he was asked to form a
new ministry. The count was born m
in 1S59 at Graz, was educated at the W
University of Graz and entered the m
service of the state in 1SS1. He began I
his parliamentary career on March 2, Mil
1891, when he was elected tothe llll
reichsrath. In 1894 he became a min- I
istcrial director in the department of 8
which he afterwards became the il
head. In the Interval he was out of jl
office for a time, resigning after the I
fall of the Windische-Graetz cabinet. m
ENTENTE FEARS I
MM I
Berlin, Oct. 20, by wireless to Say-
vllle. "That the entente is fearful H
tof the effect of German submarine op
jeratlons is regarded by the German
press as clearly proved by the con' ,
jtinuous agitation on the part of the
I entente press In an effort to Induce
' the taking of measures by the United , H
'States against German submarine H
I warfare near American waters," says jH
an Overseas News Agency announce- H
ment today. H
"It is pointed by the German news- H
papers that submarine U-53 carried on H
cruiser warfare and operated more )
than forty miles from the coast of tho ,8
I United States, while Brltis cruisers ! I
closely approached the coast at the I H
I three mile distance In seeking to de- I
'stroy without warning a German com- I I
merclal submarine that was sailing) I I
The question asked by the press is: I I
'Is It the Germans or the British who I
make war before the gates of tho
I United States?' Tho newspapers ob- I
serve further that submarine activity I
I is exclusively a German-American and 'B
not a British-American matter."
Paris Reviews Situation. I I
Paris, Oct 19, 9 p. m. The Journal 'fl
Des Debats in a long leader on tho m V
Greek situation, calls attention to the
press campaign against Venizelos in H
Spanish and other papers of German-
ophile tendencies and regrets finding , H
in the American press certain stric- ( H
hires concerning the action of tho al-
lies toward an "Independent state."
"Our American conferees," says tho I
paper, "have only to recall tho his- , I
tory of their own country to dispel '
thought that the allies committed iwk
acts of violence contrary to the large fl
principles of International relations.
As Washington rebelled against the Hj
arbitrary procedure of Great Britain, V
in order that he might found a free M M
state, so Venizelos went to Salonlki
to create anew country. As France H
gave with enthusiasm its armed co- V'
operation to Washington, so she may
and ought to gtvo It to Venizelos with-
out Infringing the great principles M
which inspire free peoples.
"This time, however, Franco and )
Great Britain are proceeding in ac- B ,
cord for the same cause. We should M
be happy to see tho United States of
America faithful to tho memory of ,
their struggle for independence and B
recognizing with us that free Greece B .
is found at this moment at Salonlki B
and no longer at. Athens." fl
