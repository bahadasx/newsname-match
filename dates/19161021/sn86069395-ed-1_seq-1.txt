Bliss Perry, former editor of the
Atlantic Monthly, who voted for Mc
Kinley and Taft, has come out for
Wilson and declares that he knows
personally that the abuse heaped on
him by Hughes is underserved.
Hughes has shifted again and now
claims to be for peace. He said art
Saginaw: "A vote for me, is a vote
for permanent peace based on self
respect and the esteem and respect
of others."
The U. S. Public Health service
has sent out a notice that owing Zo
the shortage in the paper market the
mailing list of health bulletins will be
curtailed. A horrible fear has arisen
that our old friend the Cong. Roc

happenings m Congress.
The primary election to nominate
a candidate for Mayor, or rather two
candidates who will have to run
against each other Nov. 7, will be held
today between the hours of 6 a. m.,
and 4 d. m. Only the newly
registered voters can participate. At
east four of the hve candidates are
confident of getting on the November
ballot. A guess is too hazardous.

A Republican women's Wilson club
was organized with a membership of
over 200 and a similar organization
was organized at Carbondale. I hese

in many instances by republican wo
men's Wilson clubs.

CALLOWAY NEXT WEEK
His Opponent Has So Far
Made No Public Speeches
in His Candidacy.
Judge Chas. II. Bush lias spent all
this week at home. He has held
court occasionally and some cases
have been tried by Judge McCarroll,
in winding up the matters that have
to be passed upon. Judge Bush will
go to Calloway next week for a num
ber of speeches. So far as known
his opponent, Sam T. Fruit, is making
no active canvass, at least no speeches
have been reported.
Judge Bush is receiving the un
divided support of the Democratic
party as well as many Republicans
who recognize his great ability and
realize the necessity of having a
lawyer of his character and experi
ence on the bench. His friends con
fidently believe that he will run
ahead of the national ticket in this i
county. Few if any of the SOO Dem
ocrats who scratched- last year will
fail to vote for Judge Bush.
C. P. MEETING
HAS CLOSED
Dr. Courtner's Discourse Last
Night One of Best of
Series.
The series of meetings, which had
been in progress at the Cumberland
Presbyterian church for two weeks,
came to a close last night, and Dr.
Courtner left at once for his home in
Marshall, Missouri. After a few days'
rest, he will begin another meeting
in that state. Large crowds attended
all the services here and the meeting
was productive of much good. His
discourse last night was one of the
best of the reries and was delivered
to a very large audience.
DAUGHTERS OF REVOLUTION.
The Clarksville members of, the
D. A. R., who expected to be here
yesterday afternoon at a meeting of
the local chapter, were deterred by
fhe weather from coming. The local
daughters held an interesting meeting
as planned, inviting a number of
ladies to take the places of the dele
gation from Clarksville. The Library
Assembly room was , beautifully
decorated for the occasion and the
program was carried out and refresh
ments were served.
NEAR1NG COMPLETION.
Maret & Kruger, roof contractors
for the Weyman-Bruton factory, are
now putting on the roof, which con
tains more than 400 squares. The
general contractor was to finish the
work by Oct. 25, but tho roof con
tractors have been unable to gel ma
terials in time. The permanent
floors will be laid as fast as the roof
is put on, which will make the big
building ready for occupancy.
Norman Prince, of Boston, Sergeant-Major
in the Franco-American
Flying Corps, has been killed, accord
ing to dispatches from Paris. Prince
was decorated for distinguish service
a little over a week ago. He was a
Harvard graduate who gave up a law
practice in Chicago to volunteer for
service with the Allies. Ho was dec
orated In October, 1015, for destroy
ing a German warplane. His machine
was shot down in an aerial battle over
Verdun last Juno, . but be escaped
without Injury and -was .reported re

CAR- SHORTAGE
IS SERIOUS
Coal Situation Is Much Un
settled In Conse
quence. GRAB GAME FOR CARS
Local Dealers Are Having
Much Difficulty To Get
Coal.
Louisville, Ky., Oct. 20. Because
the coal car shortage has developed to
a point where a steam coal famine
exists In Louisville, as well as ad
vanced prices on domestic coal, action
by the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion is declared by coal men to be
the only hope of preventing a trouble
some situation. Almost prohibitive
prices are in effect, it developed
Thursday.
Prices quoted by dealers on steam
coal show that manufacturers arc now
paying $2 a ton at the mines for coal
for which they paid 75 cents a few
weeks ago. Delivered in Louisville,
this coal is $2.75 per ton. Domestic
coal has just taken its second jump
of the season and the best grade is
selling at $4.50 and inferior grades at
$3.75 per ton, an advance of 65 cents
over the summer place.
The same condition exists in this
city, and though within 30 miles of
the mines the local dealers are having
a hard time to get coal enough to fill
even small orders. Some summer
contracts are unfilled and the L. & N.
railroad claims that more than half of ,
its 19,500 cars are now off the system
and can't be gotten back- There has
been some talk of starting a wagon
train to the mines. ,

chants Association Wires
R. E. Cooper.
Mr. R. E. Cooper yesterday re
ceived tho following telegram:
R. E. Cooper,
Chairman Conference Committee.
Tobacco Growers of U. S.
Hopkinsville, Kentucky.
According to newspaper reports,
the British Government is again in
terfering with American shipments of
tobacco. If there is anything our (As-
sociation can do, please advise us.
Charles Dushkind, Sec.
Tobacco Merchants' Asso.
5 Beckman St., N. Y.
Mr. Cooper wired the Association
to use its influence with the Secreta
ry of State to put into full force and
effect the James Amendment to the
Revenue bill, which authorizes retali
atory measures to be backed by the
army and navy.
FREES TOBACCO
FROMTCNNESSEE
The Notice Relieves Tension
Brought About By Re
cent.. Seizures.
Washington, Oct. 20. The State
Department received an official report
Thursday containing the information
that Great Britain has released a car
go of 500 hogsheads of dark tobacco
shipped by Rudolph Hack & Compa
ny, of Clarksville, Tenn., on the
steamer Trafalgar and consigned to
Copenhagen, Denmark, presumably
for trans-shinment to the Central
Powers.
The department's advices gave no
further details, but the news tended
somewhat to relieve the tension caused
by the recent announcement that the
British Government is holding up
large consignments of American to
bacco on the ground that they failed
to comply with the recent provision
under which cargoes paid for before
August 4 and shipped before August
30 might proceed.
A storm of protests has reached the
State Department from tobacco firms
and some individual growers in the
dark region against the announced
purpose of the British Government to
enforce literal compliance with the
requirement that the tobacco must
have been paid for before August 4
by the ultimate consumer to be al
lowed to proceed. It was believed
that all the British Government would
insist on would be a bona fide sale to
European wholesalers.

THE WOODS
Democratic Orators Will Start
Vigorous Speaking Cam
paign Next Week.
MANY SPEAKERS OUT
Republicans Also Will Hold
Numerous Meetings In
The County.
From now on it will be politics first
and the rest nowhere.
The Democrats will start out a full
corps of speakers Tuesday to hold
meetings at the many places in the
county mentioned on another page of
this paper. Some of the local speak
ers have been called upon by other
counties, but there will be enough
left to assure a red-hot campaign from
now nn.
The Republicans also have a list of
appointments, but it is not their cus
tom to give too much publicity to
what they arc doing. They arc evi
dently relying mostly on a still hunt
to hold their normal majority in this
county, in the face of the coming land
slide for Wilson.
CHICAGOMANRUN

cah Mob That Lynched
Negroes.
Paducah, Ky., Oct. 20. Because
he made a remark in connection with
the lynching of two negroes here Mon
day morning, Jack Ringhesin, of Chi
cago, foreman of a crew of steampipe
fitters at work at the Illinois Central
shops, was chased from Paducah by
employes of the shops, who gave him(
two hours to leave.
Ringhesin didn't wait for a train,
but crossed the river to Illinois in a
gasoline boat. He was alleged to
have said that the north whipped the
south once about the negroes, and
would do it again if necessary.
G. D. Rose, husband of the woman
victim of one of the negroes lynched,
is employed at the shops, where more
than one thousand men are employ

PERONNE

Take Offensive.
MANY PRISONERS TAKEN
Troops of Central Powers
Pushed Back at Several
Points by King Ferdinand.
London, Oct. 20. Gradually the
French are drawing their front closer
to the town of Peronne, on the- east
ern banks of the Somme river in
France.
To the north and east of Sailly-
Saillesel, where the French have ad
vanced their line in the last few days
at what the Berlin war office asserts
was a cost uTcasualties not commen
surate with the gains, the Germans
have made a violent counter-attack,
which was repulsed by the French.
Berlin admits that in their attacks
on the Sars-Morval front, the British
captured German positions, but says
these later were retaken. Heavy
rains fell Thursday on the British
front and except for a slight gain by
the British at Butte de Warlencourt
and the repulse of a German counter
attack, comparative quiet prevailed.
As yet no decisive results have been
achieved by either the Austro-Ger-
mans or the Russians in the violent
fighting that has been going on for
several days in Volhynia and Galicia.
South of Zborow in Galicia several
enterprises have been carried out suc
cessfully by the Austrians, while at
other points Russian attacks wpre put
down.
RUMANIANS TAKE C-FFENSIVE.
Having held the Teutonic allies in
the mountain passes on the Transyl
vania-Rumanian border for several
days, the Rumanians have taken the
offensive at various points and now
are declared to be pushing back their
adversaries, who are leaving prison
ers and guns in the hands of the Ru
manians. Berlin, however, controverts this
statement by the assertion that the
Austro-Germans are engaged in suc
cessful fighting in the mountain
passes.
Generally speaking there is no
change in the situation in Macedonia,
although the entente and Teutonic al
lies make claim to minor successes on
various sectors. The Bulgarians in
the vicinity of Monastir are bringing
up reinforcements and a large num
ber of trench mortars.
Except on Mount Pasubio in the
Trentino region where the Austrians
in violent attacks recaptured positions
taken Tuesday by the Italians, only to
be driven out again, artillery duels
are taking place in the Austro-Italian
theater.
