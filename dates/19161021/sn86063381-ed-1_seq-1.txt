CONTINUING DANGER THRUST
UPON AMERICAN PEOPLE
Monroe Doctrine Makes It Necessary
for United States to Pay for
Destroyed Property.
By George F. Anthier.
(Special to the Pioneer)
Chicago, Oct 21 Mexico cannot
be erased from the issues of this cam
paign. It is theone outstanding blot
in the recent history of the country,
and must remain an element of dan
ger to the American people for many
years to come It is the most elo
quent commentary on the absurd
claim that
J'Wilson
*v el
kept us out of
war" We have engaged in three
ars with Mexico as a result of the
application of the policy for which is
claimed the credit of "keeping the
country out of war By the appli
cation of this policy Mexico has been
turned into anarchy, and for the very
reason that the same policy nearly
precipitated us into the European
war. It has been a policy of med
dling interference, of shuffling exe
cution, completely vitiated by the
fact clearly understood by the Mexi
cans, that the policy would not be
backed with firmness.
Vi
Germans Withdraw.
In the European situation the same
policy resulted in the violation of
tieutral rights by the allied powers,
nd in the inauguration of the sub
arine campaign by Germany. That
policy invited a situation from which
we were saved only by good judg
ment of the German government
which withdrew from a critical posi
tion when public opinion in this
country demanded a show of firmness
oh the part of the American govern
ment. In Germany there was a
strong and powerful government
which could silence the resentment
at a people finding their government
a position from which it was hu
miliating to withdraw, and into
which it would never have entered
had it been confronted with the same
policy of firmness which it eventually
met.
In Mexico there is no government.
What government there was the med
dling policy of the administration ut
terly destroyed In the minds of the
Mexican peons who followed the lead
ership of Carranza and Villa, and
whom Secretary of War Baker has so
unblushingly compared with the pa
triots of Washington's army, there is
no conception of the power of the
"United States they fear, Texas, but
imagine if they could once get be
yond Texas they could destroy the
hated gringoes. Firmness and pres
tige are the elements they respect.
They sense the absence of firmness
and rejoice in the loss of American
prestige.
Ousts Huerta.
Although declaring the Mexicans
would not be interfered with the
executive at Washington determined
to get rid of Huerta No one has
ever entered a brief defense of Hu
tu erta, but with other Mexican leaders,
Tfcjuerta's record compares favorably
It is not the custom of governments
to go behind! the record, and to do so
necessarily consists of direct inter
ference It was the business of Mex
icans to decide whether or not Huerta
should remain in power It was not
our business, unless the American
government had decided upon posi
tive interference.
John Lind was sent to Mexico with
a mission of eliminating Huerta The
president's pohcv was described as
one aimed to prevent the assumption
of power in Latin republics by viol
ence. This appeared to be sound
policy in itself, even though it did
not square with the policy of non
-interference, but the administration
Straightway contradicted itself again
in the case of Benevides in Peru, and
of Zamor in Haiti Death and viol
ence attended the accession to power
of Benevides It occurred while the
negotiations with Huerta were pend
ing, but the recognition of Bene
vides came so swiftly that diplomats
who were watching the situation
from Mexico were dazed by its cel
erity. The elimination of Huerta
was attended with the attack and oc
cupation of Vera Cruzthe first war
the administration kept us out of.
Anarchy Reigns.
Whatever may have been the char
acter of Huerta, he was the one sal
vation of the Mexican situation. With
Huerta gone anarchy reigned.
Then followed more meddling in
terference in the face of the declared
-policy of non-interference. Villa was
