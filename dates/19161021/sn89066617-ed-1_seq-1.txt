KKPFBLICAXS HOLD LARGE
MEETING AT EGYPT MILLS
Henry Kersting of St. Louis and
several county Republican candidates
last night addressed a large crowd in
the New Schoolhouse at Egypt Mills.
The room, which seats more than one
hundred people, was filled, and the
standing room was taken.
Mr. Kersting made a strong appeal
for the whole Republican ticket, from
the candidate for President down to
the candidates for county offices.
Capt. Harry W. Bridges. Republican
nominee for Representative, predicted
the election of every Republican coun
ty candidate by majorities ranging
from 400 to 1200. He said the presi
dential contest would result in a na
tional Republican victory, and predict
ed that Judge Lamm and the State
candidates would sweep Missouri.
Judge John A. Snider and Judge Ed
ward D. Hays, nominees for the Com
mon Pleas and Circuit courts, respec
tively, were invitee! to address the
meeting, but eliminated politics from
their discussions, because they are can
didates for judicial positions.

JUDGE SNIDER IS
HURT WHEN AUTO
BUMPS INTO HIM
His Machine Loses Wheel and
Car that Struck Him Turns
Turtle.
Judge John A. Snider of the Com
mon Pleas Court, had a narrow es
cape from serious injury last night
when an automobile, driven by Charles
Birkman, and occupied by three other
passengers, ran into the machine driv
en by the Judge on Proafiway near
Henderson avenue. The left front
wheel of Judge Snider's car was torn
off, the axel bent, and he suffered an
abrasion over the left temple.
The Dirkman car turned over and
the occupants were hurled to the .ide
of the street, but no one was seriously
hurt. Mr. Pirkman's right hand was
lacerated.
The accident was due to the steering j
gear of the Dirkman car suddenly be
coming defective, and before he could
stop the machine, it crashed into Judge
Sniiler's car. !

read at a pig ipuouc meeting at
Madgeburg Wednesday by National
Liberal Leader Schiffer. The letter
said, in part:
"The hopes of our enemies, based
on extraordinary simultaneous exer
tions on all fronts, can only be frus
trated through mighty efforts on our
part. We will accomplish this if the
German people stand united behind us,
give us their confidence and do not de
moralize the army by controversies
over the expediency of means and
ways to success. If, to the outside,
it seems that the pi-ogram on certain
questions is lacking, this does not
prove that the program is actually at J
fault."
Field Marshal von Hindenburg's
message had the disadvantages of be
ing delivered at a private gathering of
auditors who were not interested in
having it gain a wider circulation. Gen.
von Ludendorf's letter, however, lias
been sent broadcast throughout the
country, through reports of the meet
ing at which it was read, being car

BAUER BAKERY IS P
DAMAGED BY FIRE
Fire of unknown origin last night
destroyed the oven building of the
Bauer Bros, bakery at Broadway and
Sprigg street when the damage was
about $1500.
The started inside of the
building in which the ovens are
located, and it is believed that the fire
found its origin inside the ovens. When
it was discovered it had a good start
and before the firemen arrived at the
bakery, the flames virtually covered
the small building.
The walla of the oven were so dam
aged that last night it was said the
structures probably will have to be
wrecked and new ones put in their
place.
The, fire started about 7:S0 o'clock
and was controlled by the firemen by
about 8 o'clock.

made any- mention in the indorsement
that they were signing for the part

might subsequently obtain against the
Manns would clearly be thrown upon
the partnership.
When the bankruptcy trials resulted
it became apparent that the estates of
the two brothers as individuals werr
virtually worthless, whereas, the es
tate of the mercantile concern devel
oped assets amounting to almost
?.T,000.
The State National Bank of Little
Rock held such a note for $rv5,.",S2.Sr
which its attorneys endeavored to have
accounted as an obligation of the part
nership. Had it been counted an obli
gation of the partnership, the bank
would have had an opportunity to
share in the assets of the concern.
If the claims were against the Mann
brothers as individuals, the claim was
considered worthless.
Several hearings were held to probe
the case, and a few days ago, Kne
hans wrote his opinion, holding that
the bank claims were against the two
brothers as individuals.
The banks having the notes now are
forced to place their claims against
each of the individuals.
About ten different banks held the
