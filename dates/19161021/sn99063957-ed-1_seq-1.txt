Field Marshall Mackensen Makes Tremendous Smash . at
i Russo-Rumanian Front at Dobrudja Capturing Villages

Somme FrontSerbs Crowd Bulgars Back and Are

By William Philip Simms,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Paris, Oct. 21. German troops apaprently are trying
to regain the initiative on the Somme.
Repeated terrific counter attacks have been delivered
by the Teutons, especially north of the river in the past
few days, preceded by a heavy expenditure of ammuni
tion. Each of these blows, according to reports from
French headquarters, has been shattered one after
another.
The French continue slowly while surely winning their
objectives on the Somme, namely, the heights, Failways
and important highway junctions.
The Germans are suffering greatly from inferiority in
the aeiial branch of warfare on the Somme, the head
quarters reports today. As rapidly as German airmen
appear along the Anglo-French front they are attacked
and driven back. The German commanders thus far lack
information about movements going on behind the allied
front. .
In several instances in the last few days the Germans
have spread a curtain fire over vacant ground, wasting
shells lavishly for lengthy periods, either because of poor
range directing by their aviators or because of nervous
ness on the part of their commanders, fearing an attack
at some unexpected point. - ;.
French officials declared today that they have learned
that the Germans are now systematically trying to create
the impression among the neutrals that France is worn
out by 27 months of war. On the contrary, they said,
France is determined to continue battering the German
line with huge, newly-created artillery and other offen
sive materials all winter, despite rain, snow and sleet,
maintaining the initiative,
preventing the transportation of troops to other fronts.
.The French plan to keep their own troops as comfort-;
able as possible and the Germans as uncomfortable as pos
sible during the coming winter months.

Athens Under French Rule.
London, Oct. 21. Vice-Admiral Du
Fournot, commanding the allied fleet in
Greek waters, has assumed complete con
trol of the situation at Athens and has
tiken drastic steps to prevent further

The vice-Admiral received these pow

to appoint inspectors with similar pow

Seven Reported Lost
Wrecked Barge Ship
mg Held Up by Gale
Detroit, Mich., Oct. 81. Seven men
reported lost today in the foundering
of an unidentified barge, believed to
he the B. L. Filer, of Chicago, off Bar
Point, at the Detroit river entrance to
Lake Ktie. One member of the crew
was believed te have been rescued by
th D. & C. steamer Western States.
A wireless message from the West
ern States to the D. & C offices here
gave the information of the- wreck.
Wirelessed reports from the Western
States gave the name of the foundered
craft as the B. L. Fisher, but records
here failed to-shbw'the existence of
such a vessel. Marine men believe the
barge is the Filer. The Filer left Cleve
land October 19 for Chicago in tow of
the steamer Tempest, of the Hamilton
Transportation company, CliieaRO. No
word has reached Detroit concerning the
Tempest.
The Western States was en route tl
Cleveland when she came upon . th
wreck, off Bar Point. A 50 mile gale
which swept the lake throughout the
night had held the D. & C. steamer in
shelter at the mouth of the Detroit river-
She was due in Cleveland at 6
o'clock this morning.
The lone survivor of the barge's crew
was reported to have been rescued from

London, Oct. 1 (By mail) Offi
cer' wives and families, left iu
straitened circumstances, are being
cared for in a magnificent manner by
the British government. Private ho
tels, boarding houses, residences and
public buildings ar being commandeer

The method or sexiring these place

Cold Drizzle For An Hour

By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Long" Branch, N. J., Oct. 21. Back at
Shadow Lawn today after what he re
gntds"the most successful trip" of hi
campaign, President Wilson prepared to
launch his most vigorous efforts during
the two weeks now remaining before
election.
This afternoon he addressed a delega
tion of farmers from the veranda of the
j-ummer White House here; Wednesduy
he leaves lor Cincinnati, where he
speaks Thursday, returning to Long
Branch for another "porch speech"
next Saturday, The 'following week hoi
speaks at Buffalo, New York City and
final speech at Shadow Lawn.
The democratic lieutenants no longer
believe the president will "carry" the
election. They are talking "landslide."
They're a mighty confident group of
party leaders. They believe that the
trip of the president through Pennsyl
vania yesterday,- when thousands of peo
ple met the train at every station in
npite f the coijinvous downpour of
rain, indicate "the way of the tide."
At Lancaster, last night, a community
which hasn't gone democratic since the
Civil war, fully 10,000 people waited in
a Cold drizzle for more than an hour
and gave the president a great ovation.
President Wilson himself was tired
but highly satisfied today. He is con-
fident of the verdict of the voter two
weeks from Tuesday. His long visit
I with former Secretary of State Bryan,
the first meeting they had enjoyed to-
gether since Bryan's spectacular resig-
inntion, put him in fine Bpirits.
' rue little luncheon party which
served to bring the president and his
former cabinet premier into intimate
touch Bgain was unique. When Bryan
reached Pittsburg the president asked
him to ride in the same automobile
with him,
"No, this is your day," Bryan re
plied. "I am just an interested onlook
er like the rest-"
They rode iu separate car.
When they returned to the train the
president asked the commoner to take
luncheon with him. Again Bryan do-
mtirred, but this time the president
said:
"Come on now. I have had a plate
laid specially for you."

in Government Care
least fifteen people are pounding t.on
don s pavement searching for new
homes today, realizing that they arej
helping the government provide for
those whose need it great.
To compensate the owners or leasee
of commandeered building, the gov
ernment allows a certain portion of the
yearly rent. The furniture and serv
ants are taken over with the buildings,
the government becoming active head
of the hotel or residence. The empire'
agents who inspect the premise to be
used for officer's families are skilled
iu the work, for they invariably take
over those containing every couveu-
lience.
Six months ago, London newspapers
; contained scores of advertisement ask-
ing dumicile for officers wives. The
little "ads" were pitiful in a way,
as each suggested the picture of a
nervous and fear stricken woman who
had waved farewell to a husband going
to the front, smiling bravely until the
train pulled out and then sobbing her
way to tome strange hotel Today there
advertisement have practically disap
peared. The official heart of the gov

Wilson's Pictures Every-where-'Hurrah
for Wil

By J. P. Yoder.
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Phoenix, Ariz., Oct. 21. It was hard
for Colonel Roosevelt to remember what
be came out here for today. He made
a 2,100 mile jump from Louisville with
only a few stops in between, to utter
his most -bitter denunciation of Presid
ent Wilson' Mexican policy and urge
tho election of Charles Kvaus Hughes,
but wherever he turned he found old
scenes and old faces that tended to take
his mind off his job.
The Colonel wa-s met here by a big
committee composed of members of the
G. A. H., Spanish war veterans and Con
federate veterans, headed by Dwight B.
Heard, an old personal friend, and Jack
Greenway, a major in the Rough Riders,
who before that was Yale' famous
backstop who caught the curve of
"Dutch" Carter, brother-in-law of Hu
ghes.
There were tho usual hands and day
light bombs to greet Roosevelt. He
launched at Head' house, with Jack
Greenway, and then spoke at 2:0 this
afternoon. The colonel was to be guest
of honor at a dinner at tho Head home
tonight when several friends of rancli-
ing days were expected in. 'Roosevelt
had been urged not to stop today until
he reached Phoenix, but he forced Regit
Post, in charge of hi tour, to arrange
a atop at Prescott, home of Bucky O'-
weiii. wucKv died in The colonel' arms
half way up San Juan Hill and the colo
nel, although the stop hud to be made
at U:1U ordered Post to wire ahead that
ho would make a short speech.
Gallup Woke Him Up.
All day yesterday and today Roosevelt
was in hi element. He simply drank
in the western scene. "By George,"
he exclaimed at one timo during lunch,
"I'd like to be young again and be out
here. If it weren't for Mr. Rooaevclt
and the children, I'd build myself a cab
in out here with a bath tub in it and
just stay until I died. By George, but
I would."
But it remained for Gallup, N. M.,
where he raised half of his Rough Ki
ders, to furnish the reul thrills of the
westward bound trip. Nearly all of the
towa of 3.UUO crowded about to see him
He hadn't started speaking when noisy
heckling began. -
"How's Teddy, but Wilson for me,
shouted a railroad man.
Roosevelt attempted nguin and ngair
to start speaking, but oihers took up
the cry. "How ubout Wilson; I'll bet
you love him."
"I love no ono too proud to fight,"
retorted Roosevelt.
"We've all got good jobs, why should
we change f" was shouted.
"Yes, but you forget the thousands
out of work until tne European war
pnt money in your pockets," said Ruose
vclt.
"How about tho 1007 panic!" a man
called; "at that we would vote for you
if you wore running."
"What did you ever dot We've
got eight hours," yelled a railroader
with brass lungs.
Teddy Lost His Temper.
"You fool and coward," shouted the
colonel, "go home and sober up."
Then as Roosevelt was declaring no
American was killed by any foreigner
during his term, a man at the edge of
the crowd who held a baby iu his
arms, shouted: "Yes, but you let the
Taps into the school when I lived in
Californis."
"And I ent the battle fleet around
to Japan to prevent trouble," called
back Roosevelt.
"How many mint juleps did yon have
at Louisville f " asked the raiituad man.
The colonel was lenning over the end
of his car, shouting in his loudest tones,
obviously enjoying the verbal battle
royal. The railroader was the last man
to shake Roosevelt' hand as the train
pulled nut.
"You're a grand mnn, Colonel," he
called, running along with the slowly
moving train, ' ' but me lor vt oodrow

Aboard Roosevelt's Special . Train,
Prescott, riz-, Oct. 21. Ex-President
Roosevelt would have gone Into Mex
ico up to the hilt if he had been presi
dent last spring, he told an audience
here today, and he would have put 1n
charge of the border difficulty a man
of the type of "Bucky" O'Ne'ill.
Prescott wai "Bucky V home town.
"Bucky" died in Roosevelt' arms on
San Juan hill. Roosevelt declared
"Bucky", if alive, could have cleaned
up the border in 90 day, Roosevelt
said:
"I am asked what I would have done
in Mr. Wilson ' case about Mexico. Tho
answer is perfectly simple: I would
either have made up my mind to hit or
not hit. But under no circumstances
would I have hit aoft.
"The right rule Is don't hit all If
you can help it. If you must hit a man,
don't hit him soft: knock him ouv
"Pershing was sent after Villa. If
he was sent at all it should have beet
understood that the job was to be put
through up to the hnndlp- When Car
ranza said Pershing could not use the
railroads I would have Instantly re
sponded: 'General Pershing will use the
railroads and he will treat as an enemy
anv man who Interfere with him.'
"When Carranza said Pershing could
not enter the town. I would have said:
'He shall enter the towns. He shull go
anywhere and , he shall treat anyone
opposing him as acting In the interest
of villa.'
"Above all, aiji Carranza and the
Carrnnza soldiers fonght our troops and
killed them, Icahould have instantly di
rected Pershing to utrike back a hard
as he knew how, and not inquire which
particular bandits killed our men. If
this had been done, the trouble would
have been settled last June, It would
have opened the miue and I will guar
antee that four-fifths of the insurgent
armies would instantly have gone back
to work when they found they could get
wages and food and protection.
"We now have 150,000 soldiers on the
border. They've been there four months.
If 'Buckey' O'Noill were alive toduy I
would have put him on the border with
a proper force under him and I will
guarantee that in 60 days there would
not be a bandit venturing to wiuk cross
eved nt us, and if we had a man In the
White House this kind of thing would
be doue now."

"The police are hunting my clinie
today," she went on. "They ean't find
