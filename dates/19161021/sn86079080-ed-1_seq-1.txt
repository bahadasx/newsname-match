EDITOR OF LE MESCHACEBE
LUCY, LA.
SDar Editor:
With reference to the com
nunication appearing in the
last issue of your valuable
I',wspapc-r and signed C. J
Tassin, parish Auditor, I
.vish to make the foliowing
$tatemtnt which I will ask
you to kindly publish in your
text issueso that the public
ight not be misguided:
"Mlr. Tassin says in part
tiat he has madea SPECIAl.
.ULIT of my books as She
riffand Tax Collector for the
ears k913, 1914 and 1915
ior taxes and 1914, 1915
,nd 1916 for licenses and
chat for "those three years
"ome $3000.00 of Parish
iicenses were either not col
ected or not accounted for,"
te says further, -*in nearly
all these cases the State licen
.es due by these delinquent
parties or firms were duly
S:aid." It seems to me that
.Ir. Tassin has done the Po
ice lurv as well as mvself a
grave idjustice in not having
itade this investigation and.,
statement at -in earlier date (
)r when he first b-came pa
rish Auditor, as it is a very,
card matter, well nigh im-r
possible, for me to keep in c
mnemory and satisfactorily
Texplain at this time what f
happened or might have-hap t
pened three yeats ago, espe- A
cially when he does not cite t
instances or particularize in 3
his conmunication bat
makes the general and vague
statement above mentioned. c
-'In his mad desire to justi- I
,y the retention of his office t
as Parish Auditor, in the face e
of the recommendation of -
the Grand Jury to the con- t
trary, Mr. Tassin does not [
'seem to mind hvw much he i
smears me or my adminis- s
tration by making such reck
less and inopportune state-it
ments.
"I am sure that Mr. Tas-.
sin is aware of the fact that
the methods of collecting the
Stateand 'arish licenses du
ring my admnist ration, and.
especially during the years
mentioned by him, were se
parate and distinct. The
$200.00 State License had
to be and was invariably col
le.ted when due and all in
cash. On the otherha id, the
$500 Parish License, in thel
majonrty ofc-ses, were col
lected by piecemeal, as per
an agreement between my-1
self and the Police jury The
advisabilitvy of such a method i
was often discussed between
myself and the Police Jury1
[ aitho/this method
aetat more work :to my of
fiýe, we arrived at the conI
ion iitha it it was the best
mitethodad would result in
mare licenses being issued
and consequently the parish
would get more revenues..

R~~··;
even by my poiltical oppo
nents. During the sixteen
years of my administration
this proposition was not op
posed or questioned by any
one and it appearance today
in print is due solely to polit
cal expediency.
"'The credit-system has
existed and exists today in all
businesses of any magnitude.
Its good aspects. when c ll
conducted, are known to all
business men and I am sure
to the Auditor himself. It is
also well known that thb
collection of ALL outstandt
ing credits is nearly a human
impossibility in any business
enterprise.
"The Auditor well kno'7
or should have taken the
trouble to inform himself
thatif, during the years men.
tioned b: him, there wei e
any parish licenses or any
part thereof uncollected that
same were turred over by
me to the Attorney for Col
l.ection ofDelinquent Licenses
who is appointed by the
Governtor for that purpose.
¢Whenever I did this my re
ponsibility in the matter
ceased.
'Besides, I hold my quietus,
from the Police Jury for all
the years mentioned by the
Auditor in his communica
'tion, except that for the past
year. In the early days oi
June, when I.turned over myv
office to the present incum

the new administration call

that Auditor rassin should

!gestion with the proviso
that Mr. Dumez. my chief
Deputy at the timne, should
look over t'-e books toge: he

SWHAT THE EDITOR
HAS TO SAY.
We reproduce in this issue a let
ter which we have received from
our friend Mr. Paul kierthelot and
which is in answer to a certain
letter signed by Mr. C. J. Tassin,
parish Auditor, and published in
our last issue.
Unforeseen events prevented us
from interviewing Mr. Berthelor
relative to certain statements
contained in Mr. 'rassin's lette
last week before we had go'e t
press hence his failure to answer
in our former issue.
Mr. Tassin's statement to th
Iffect that "some $3000 00 of th,
Parish Licenses for the years 191
1915 and 1916 have either not be?4P
collected or,same are unaccoun
eA for" is, in our opinion, t(.,
general and the high import.nc. :
of the subject-matter deman4,.
that a statement more specific
should be made in justice to every
Sne concerned.
We have always considered
a privilege to stand by and defen,
Mr. Berthelot in the past whe-n
ever we thought he was unjust'y
criticised or censured. In this i-i
stance, we take great pleasu.;
in publishing Mr. Berthelot's
.wn defense else here in th,.
issue. feeling assured that he i
fully capaole of rendering a true,
and faithful account of his
stewardship at any time that i:
.nay be called upon to do so.
