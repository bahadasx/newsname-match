Solid Negro Vote
For G.O.P. Ticket
Only Hope of Race
If the Negroes of this country have
learned anything from their exper
ience during the last four years, It Is
that for inany years' to come, the thing
to bo feared most in politics. Is the
election of a man to the presidency
of Southern birth, supported by a
Democratic Congress. Four years ago
there were thousands of Negroes who
had come to believe that it woud bo
wise to, divide their votes, and with
the hope of winning the friendship of
their Democratic neighbors, cast their
ballots for Woodrow Wilson for prest
dent They reckoned without knowledge
of the depth and intensity of the
racial prejudice of the Southern peo
ple. Their faith in Mr. Wilson was
not warranted by the facts. They
overlooked the fact that the one con
sistent policy of the Democratic party
has been its reprisals against the con
stitutional rights of the Negro.
Placing a ban upon the progress of
the Negro race is the only policy to
which President Wilson's administra
tion has consistently adhered and the
only one' that has been successful.
The president has succeeded in un
doing in four years, what the Repub
lican party has been fifty years ac
complishing for the advancement and
recognition of the rights of Negro
citizens.
Woodrow Wilson, after promising
the Negro fair play, celebrated his en
trance into the White House by clos
ing the door of opportunity to - the
Negro,
By word and deed he has en-l
couraged the enemies of the Negro"
.race and has fostered and Intensified
race prejudice throughout the country.
Disfranchisement and segregation
are purely Democratic institutions,
but it was left to Woodrow W'l5P to
be the first president of the United
States to stamp them with official
approval.
INSPIRED SEGREGATION
MOVEMENT.
While Woodrow Wilson was a can
didate for the presidency he made
promises to the Negroes that were
fairer than any ever given by a. candi
date for that high office. In his let
ters to Bishop Walters, he promised
them civil rights and privileges such
as they aro guaranteed under the con
stitution, but as soon as he was elected
he repudiated every pledge he made
them' and submitted himself absolute
ly to the counsel of the most vicious
Southern Negro-baiters such as Till
man, Vardaman, Helfin and Hard
wlck, who have shaped His policy in
dealing with the Negro race.
Inspired by the example of Presi
dent Wilson, in segregating the Ne
groes in the government departments,
Negro-baiters throughout the country
were encouraged to undertake the
segregation of the Negroes by restrict
ing their property rights in the large
cities. Baltimore, Louisville and St.
Louis, in the order named, fell Into
line with President Wilson, in this
most Infamous of all forms of reprisal
against the progress of the Negro race,
by adopting segregation ordinances.
In Baltimore and Louisville, the segre
gation ordinances were enacted by
Democratic boards of aldermen. In
St. Louis, a Republican board of alder
men refused to enact the ordinance,
which was carried later at a special

DEMOCRATS WOULD DISFRAN
CHISE NEGROES.
Among tho first bills introduced in
the 63rd Congress by a Democrat was
one to repeal the Fourteenth and Fif
teenth Amendments of tho Constitu
tion of the United States, which con
fer citizenship upon the Negro. This
was followed by other bills, introduced
by Democratic congressmen and sen
ators, to provide Jim Crow cars for
Negroes in the District of Columbia;
to segregate the races in the races in
the departments at Washington; to
repeal the criminal statute which
punishes "as a crime, conspiracy to in
jure, oppress, threaten or intimidate
any citizen of the" United States; to
forbid tho appointment of any Negro
soldier as a commissioned officer of
the army or navy, and to prevent the
enlistment of Negroes in the military
service 6f the United States.-
WILSON DISHONORED DEAD
HEROES.
When the white marines were killed
at Vera Cruz, the president went to
Brooklyn to attend the funeral and
spoke with utmost feeling of the flag
of the country for which ..they had
given ineir lives, uui wnen me col
ored troopers of the famous Tenth
cavalry, fighting against overwhelm
ing odds, displaying heroism seldom
the same country Rt Carrlzal( and
theiiremalns were brought to Wash
ington for interment at Arlington, tho
president was conspicuous by his ab
sence. He was asleep In the White
House and did not desire to be dis
turbed. In spite of nil this, the Democratic
party Is asking Negroes to voto for
Mr. Wilson. In spite of the discrim
inations and humiliations that have
been heaped upon thelrrace by them,'
Democrats hope to secure some help
from the Negro voters to gain re-election,
f
It cannot be 'that any Negro voter
could be so. destitute of self-respect
as to cast his vote for a Democrat at
this election, in the face of th6 treat
ment his race has received at the
hands of that party from the presidest
down to the petty officers of the gov
ernment.
There is no such thing in existence
as a Negro Democrat. Negroes are
Republicans from the force of circum
stances.' The Republican party alone
upholds the principles upon which
their citizenship depends. Every right
the Negro has, cither constitutional
or statutory, came from the Repub
lican party, and the Democratic party
has labored for 50 years to deprive
the Negro of the rights given to him
by the Republican party,
HUGHES A STRONG FRIEND OF
THE NEGRO,
The only salvation of the Negro in
this election, is to- cast his solid vote
for Charles Evans Hughes and the
entire Republican ticket ,Four years
more of Wilson will mean political
damnation to the Negro voters of this
country. Hughes has always stood up
boldly for justice for tho Negro and
will, if elected, right the wrongs Wil
son has done to the race.

Vote for Dickey for
U. S. Senator
Defeat Jim Reed
Arch Negro-Baiter
It Is impossiblo to exaggerate the
Importance to the negro voters of Mis
souri of giving their unanimous sup
port to the Republican candidate for
the United States Senate, Hon. Walter
S. Dickey, of Kansas City.
Mr. Dickey, by nature, education
and business training, is especially
well equipped for the place. His abil
ity and integrity as well as his poli
tical principles and practices, aid in
making him the best qualified candi
date for the position at this particular
time. .
As a loyal Republican and political
organizer, no man In the state of Mis
souri ,has done more for the state.
Ho twice delivered the electoral vote
of Missouri to the Republican candi
date for president and pilotted the
Republican party of the state into
power the first time in 40 years. But
not the least among his qualifications
for the senatorshlp is his masterly
ability as a business man and finan
cier, which has enabled him to rise
from the position of clerk, at a salary
of $50 a year to the presidency of a
million dollar manufacturing corpor
ation, with over twentv plants, with
branch establishments located In
eleven different states, and wage pay
ments annually amounting to about a
million and a quarter dollars.
The efficient discharge of the
duties of a United States senator re
quires that kind of ability which is
possessed only by the master minds
that are able to promote and manage
great business enterprises. Only such
a mind is able to correctly understand
and adjust such intricate subjects as
the tariff and other scientific prob
lebs that directly affect the prosper
ity of the nation.
Mr. Dickey has proven himself to
bo a man of wonderful capacity, alert
in judgment, quick and accurate in
responsible decision, skilled In the se
lection of men, equally keen in the
jterceptlon of opportunity and in the
apprehension of danger, decisive and
vigorous In action.

whom Mr. Dickey will succeed, If
elected, is James A. Reed, of Kansas
City, one of the arch eneml&j of tho
Negro race, in that body. During the
63rd Congress, Reed proved himself
a very fiend of race prejudice and In
making war on tho rights of the Ne
gro, distanced such Negro-baiters as
Ben Tillman and James K. Vardaman.
He voted for tho repeal of the Fif
teenth Amendment and introduced in
to the Senate and fought for the adop
'tlon of a measure to exclude from tho
United States every member of tho
African race. Reed has proven him
self a relentless and implaclble enemy
of human liberty and justice. He put
himself clearly oh record as unalter
ably opposed to every right and inter
est of the Negro and every Negro
voter In Missouri should not only cast
his vote against him, but should work
with all his might from now until tho
close of the polls on election day for
his defeat.
Walter S. Dickey, the Republican
candidate for United States Senator,
has always been the outspoken friend
of the Negro in his efforts to advance
his opportunities in the struggle of
life. He believes in the equality of
all men before the law and in their
civil and political rights and also be
lieves in equality of opportunity for
employment and has proved his belief
by employing foi many years, more
than 600 Negroes in the various man
ufacturing plants under his control.
Mr. Dickey in his personal character
is genial, approachable and altogether
amiable, and is possessed of a frank
ness and sincerity that enables him
to deal directly with any man without
red tape and formality. These qual
ities have made him the admiration
of the thousands of Negroes who havo
come into contact with him during
the last 30 years he has been In active
public life, and every Negro voter in
Missouri should make it his solemn
duty to vote for Walter S. Dickey, who
as United States Senator from Mis
souri will be an honor and credit to
the state and who will right tho
wrongs, not only of the Negro, but of
the oppressed of all mankind.
