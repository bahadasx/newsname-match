A Few Reminders
TaxPayers Should be Careful in the
Selection of the Circuit Judge
and Prosecuting Attorney.
Judge Edward Hays r Capel
Girardeau, was in Benton Inst
week and jni'l the Kicker n
short visit. He is a candidate
for clrcit judge on the Republi
can ticket,
Four yean ago Judge Hays
w:is the opponent of Judge Kelly.
Then the dtstrh . was composed I
of five counties. Since then the
legislature made a lenerate dis
trict of Pemiscot and New Mad
rid counties, leaving only Missis-1
elppt, Scott ami Cape Qlrardeau
oountlei in this district.
It seems to Die that the tax
payers ihould welcome a change.

Ordinarily the bond would haw

"In Mexico, two big parties e

Vet this is true of the United

Not only is this true of the

every day we read of such men us
Henry Ford, a Republican, sup

paper, we may read of an equally
prominent Democrat supporting
liugnes. Most of these men who
are thus reported as changing
are honorable men and their mo
tives beyond question. Some oi
them, of course, are pic-hunting
politicians.
What is the issue between the
two old parties in this campaign .
There is none.
Therefore these honorable men
above mentioned are choosing be
tween the personalities of the
two men.
lu all former campaigns the ol i
part led have rigged up some lake
as a "paramount issue." Dut iu
this campaign they have even
failed in that. Most of the talk
has been about the so-oalled 8

r.i.. u what ounllt to
issue, and not an office-seeking
politician will talk about it ex
cept in vague and indefinite
terms. ,
Where does Mr. Wilson Stand as
to the Mexican situation'.' So far
he has tried to satisfy both the
Plunderbuud and the people, and
has satisfied neither. He talk',
about being "too proud to fight,
and Watchful waiting," and
then sends bis army into Vera
Cruz to surprise and shoot up a
lot of inoffensive people men,
women and children. That was
wren he wanted Huerta to salute
the flag I
However, after needlessly
spending a few million, our troops
were sneaked out of Vera Cruz.
Carranza drove Heurta out of
Mexico and all seemed well for
the revolution until the raid on
Columbus, also planned by our in
terventionists. This gave anoth
er excuse to invade Mexico, and
our troops are still there. What
for, nobody knows, outside the in
ner ring.
What about Mr. Hughes? Well,
he criticises Mr. Wilson for wav
ering. He criticised his refusal
to recognize the assassin, Heurta.
While he doesn't say anything for
sure, .vet his talk indicates that
he would not listen ti protests
from tne people, as Mr. Wilson has
done.

a "cat in a sack," you can get
entire satisfaction by voting for

Can you understand why the
landlords and bankers have their

where the cow got out, w hen the

What about this fashiouable

"Shall we give him more time?"
"I think so," answered the sec

We have known for some time
that something was lacking in
this campaign. Now we know
what it is. Not a single paper or
politician has jumped up aud
waived the red flag aud yelled
that the Socialists are about to
plunge the world into bloody rev
olution. Can it be possible that there is
a feeling that this cry would
hardly scare anyone, when the
anti-Socialists have plunged al
most the entire world Into a
seething sea of blood ?
ALMOST.

general custom among caiile
ow ucrs in France to tint tuc in
teriors ol their sheds with a so
lution made b mixing tell pounds
of slacked lime with twenty gal
lons ol water, and then adding
one pound of ultramarine. The
sheds ore tinted with this solu
tion twice during the summer
mouths, with the result that the
cattle are pretty generally free
from annoyance.
It might be a good plan for
owners of horses aud cattle in
this country to experiment with
the use of blue about their stabLs
and out-buildings. Notnlng should
be neglected which might add to
the comfort of dumb beasts dur
ing the hot summer months.
