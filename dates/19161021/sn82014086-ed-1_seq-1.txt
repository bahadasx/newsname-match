EPISCOPALIANS DISCUSS
RECLAMATION OF MASSES
"Mistake to Bind Fortunes of Church
With Priviliged Classes."
t. Louis, Oct. 20. Urging that with
out affiliating itself with any "politi
cal scheme," the church take a larger
interest in the work of improving the
masses, leaders of the church spoke
at a Joint meeting of rne two houses
of th Protestant Episcopal general
convention here. They said that by
such action, the great mass of labor
ing people, "many of whom have been
estranged, can be won back to the
church."
The Right Rev. Bdwin S. Lines,
bishop of Newark (New Jersey) said
"it's a great mistake to bind the for
tunes of the church with the privil
eged classes."
There are many men who tell me
they are opposed to so many move
ments In the chr.-ch, but that is only
because they oppose movements of
any kind.
"It is a great misfortune to put the
fortune of the church-up to the priv
ileged people. In binding the fortunes
of the church of England with the
rivlleged class its hold on the great
body of the unrivileged has been lost.
A bishop of the English church told
me not long ago that now the priv
ileged people have lost theh interest
In the church and that the unprivil
eged have long ago been lost by the
lack of interest taken in them by the
rhurrti. That Is why the Church of
England is now so weak. Let us bind
the church by our interests and our
work, with the minds and the hearts
and the lives of the great company, of
the unprivileged and the poor."
Detroit was selected as the next

As Good For Business as For a City
Those who have gone through the mill know how to give advice.
Those who have made certain experiments do not hesitate to tell
about those which were successful and that is the case with the St.
Louis; man, who in telling about what St. Louisians were doing for
that city decjared that the way for a city to advance and become
prosperous was to first take a complete inventory of its stock and
then advertise it.
That is excellent advice and it is a tip which every business man
should take to heart, for publicity in the development of business was
utilized before it was applied to city development. A merchant should
tell about his business in the same way that a resident would boost
his city honestly, persistently and intelligently. It pays in develop
ing a city and it pays in the increasing of trade.
And the more to whom the story can be told the better will be
the results. That can be accomplished by using the advertising col
umns of The Bulletin, which goes into the homes and comes before
45,000 people daily.

AMERICAN SCHOONER WAS
ON ENGLISH BLACKLIST
Richard W. Clark, Recently Seized in
Iceland Waters.
New Bedford, Mass., Oct. 30. The
American schooner Richard W. Clark,
recently reported seized" by the British
in Iceland waters, was on the English
blacklist because she had tried to get
a cargo of herring to Germany, ac
cording to Captain J. C. Olsen of this
city, who has just returned from Ice
land, where he was master of the
American schooner 'Frank W. Benedict.
Captain Olsen charged that British
warships encroached upon the three
mile limit of Iceland and blockaded
the ports of the Danish possession.
Numbers of vessels which tried to
leave the island with herring oil while
Captain Olsen was there were turned
back by British warships, he alleged.
American vessels, he said, have not
been allowed V) load herring for Nor
way and their masters have been forc
ed to sign ipapers to the effect that
they will not sell their catches in Nor
way and certain other countries. On
foggy nights, he said, British warships
anchored across the channel so no
ships could get by them.
He claimed to have seen between
800,0-00 and one million barrels of her
ring rotting in Iceland ports, British
agents purchasing them to keep them
from eventually being shipped into
Germany.

VANDERBILTS SUE TO RECOVER
$150,000 INSURANCE MONEY
On Life of Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt,
a Lusitania Victim.
New York, Oct. 20. Suit to recover
$150,000 insurance money on the life
of Alfred Gwynne Vanoerbilt, drown
ed when the, Lusitania was .orpe56ed,
was begun here today against the
Travelers Insurance Company by
Frederick W. and Reginald C. Vander
bilt and the other executors of the
will. The company's attorney said the
claim was being contested because the
policy did not cover war risks. The
plaintiffs allege that Mr. Vanderbilt's
death was brought about "solely
through external, violent and acciden
tal means in that he was accidentally
drowned."
The complain sots forth that the
policy, guaranteeing a payment of
$50,000, was taken out m 1913 and that
the amount of the prospective benefit
was increased to $150,000 by a "rider"
shortly before Mr. Vanderbilt was
drowned.

WILSON CHARGED WITH .
SHOWING DISCRIMINATION
Charles Sumner Bird in Address to Ne
gro Audience at Boston.
Boston, Oct. 20. Charles Sumner
Bird, progressive candidate for gov
ernor in 113 in an address to a ne
gro audience tonight, asserted that
President Wilson had shown "unjust
and shameful discrimination" against
negroes. He gaid that before his elec
tion the president assured a delega
tion of negroes that under his admin
istration nondiscrimination by the na
tional government would be made
against a man because of his color or
race.
"Soon after the president entered
the White House," said Mr. Bird, "the
segregation of colored men and wom
en employed in the government de
partments was demanded by the
democrats of the south. The demand .
was .put into action with the knowl
edge .and consent of President Wil
son. In the treasury, state, war, navy
and other departments mora than 2,
000 faithful and efficient negro work
ers were humiliated and insulted and
hundreds lost their positions.
"On September 1, 1914, President
Wilson, by an executive order, made
every applicant under the civil ser
vice furnish with his application a
true photograph of himself. The ob
vious purpose of this order was to in
form the appointing officer of the race
of the applicant. Th effect of this
order was to close theTloor of the gov
ernment service to every man and
woman of colored parentage.
"I am the son of an abolitionist. I
would be ' recreant to the memory of '
my father and to the host of great
souls who half a century ago were en
gaged in the battle for human free
dom, if today I failed in courage to
protest at the inhuman treatment of
the negro by Mr. Wilson during his
entire term of office."
