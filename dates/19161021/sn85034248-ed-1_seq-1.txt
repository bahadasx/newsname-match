"The Gilded Spider."
Love and jealousy, hatred and ven
geance, excitement and sensation are
powerfully portrayed in the Bluebird
p hotoplay, "The Gilded Spider,"
which is to be the attraction at the
Grand Theatre Sunday, with beauti
. ful Louise Lovely as the star. The
fountains of sensationalism have been
drawn upon for new methods to quick
en the interest; stirring scenes fol
low in quick succession; there is a
thrill and a throb in every moment,
and an engaging love story to fire the
imagination and double the interest.
Coveted by a millionaire world
cruising yachtsman, the beautiful wife
of an humble Italian is kidnapped
but rather than submit, she drowns
herself. Every hour her husband
lives thereafter, the desire for ven
geance grows deeper in his heart.
How the Italian follows the American
to his home, kidnaps the millionaire's
wife, comes face to face with the man
he seeks and is denied, by sudden
death, the vengeance that he craves,
forms but an outline of the gripping
plot of "The Gilded Spider."
"The Feul Girl."
In "The Fuel Girl," which comes to
the Grand Monday, Hazel Dawn has
the role of a girl of the mountains
who is selected by the head of her
clan, her father, as the feminine con
tribution to a marriage which is to
unite the Haddon and Bassett feud
ists, to effect a reconciliation that will
make possible the sale of property the
title to which is the bone of conten
tion between the clans.
"The Feud Girl" is from an origi
nal script. Fred Thompson has pro
duced it. For his backgrounds he
went into the mountains of Georgia,
virgin soil indeed for the camera. To
the good cast selected for the princi
-las -idded many of-the
natives-not types, but actualities-
and they are well marshalled. It is a
picturesque country, with its hills,
waterfalls, cabins. The photography,
too, is excellent.
The story developes real strength.
There are situations, three of them
especially, that make themselves felt.
The atmosphere of the hills-of
strong passions, of hate and love-is
present.
"The Man from Bitter Roots."
Love and adventure vie for inter
est in the William Fox feature film,
"The Man from Bitter Roots," which
will be shown at the Grand Tuesday.
Bruce Burt (William Farnum) is a
burly, whole-hearted man, who thinks
never of himself, but always of his
duty to those dependent on him.
Bruce starts out on a hunt for the
sister of his former mining partner,
to give her the share of gold dust due
her. In the search he tells his story
to another man, Sprudell, who finds
the girl, gives her $500, which, he
says, is the share due her from the
mine, and starts the Bitter Roots Min
ing Company for himself.
Then Bruce turns up. He has
learned of the scheme of the unscru
pulous financier, and is determined to
foil it. He has trouble in raising the
money to carry through his own pro
ject, but finally manages to do so.
Then he finds the girl, tells her the
true story, and forms a partnership
with her. They determine to fight
Sprudell and regain their rightful
ownership of the mine.
A new plant goes up on the Bitter
Rloots Mining Company property. It
belongs to Bruce and Helen. But it
is scarcely completed when a devas
tating fire sweeps the land, complete
ly destroys the building and leaves
the place in ruins. Everything has
gone against Bruce. He even learns
that Sprudell and his scheming part
ners had arranged the fire themselves.
He writes to Helen in despair.
As a great sacrifice, Helen goes to
Bruce's father, a wealthy ranchman,
from whom he had been estranged,
The purity and goodness of the girl,
and her ec'nest pleas for the son, win
the old m'h, and in the end father and
son are reunited, the Bitter Roots
Mining Company is re-established and
Helen becomes general manager of
more things than a mine.
George Beban in "Pasquale."
It is a picture to touch the heart,
this five-reel offering. "Pasquale,"
with George Beban in the leading role,
which the Grand will present Wednes
day. The story is filled with unex
Pected and thoroughly delightful
touches of human understanding and
sympathy, bits often times of sheer
fnspiration. The best thing about it
is that the chief characters affect you
as real human beings; you can't re-1
sist them. The best of them, by all
odds, are Pasquale, by Beban. and
Margarita, by Helen Eddy, but all the
Others are good, too.
The main thread of the plot is
light, yet compact with emotion of
the sincerest and broadest kind. To
bolster this is a secondary plot, very
melodramatic and fashioned to fit
the taste of the day. These two are
ably knit. The second helps the first
to its happy ending and keeps it from
being truthful. Pasquale, simple and
lo.able son of Italy, loves Margarita,
and Columbo, his horse that drags his
fruit cart. He is thrifty and is suc
ceeding with his store. Margarita
loves Charlie and marries him. Pas--,
quale goes away to the great war and
leu:ics Margarita and Charlie iil
charge of Columbo and of the store,
and Margarita and Columbo are both
roughly treated. Later Pasquale
comes back. Things are pretty bad
and he is about to clear out when the
secondary plot comes to the rescue
and Charlie, doing some more of his
villain work, is killed.
The novel and artistic method of
presenting the leaders is commend
able. There are some scenes showing
the great war in Europe, and they not
only fit the story perfectly, but are as
realistic as scenes cut from some re
cent topical. It is a good offering.
"The Eye of God."
Tyrone Power and Lois Weber play 1
the principal parts in the Bluebird fea
ture, "The Eye of God," which is an
nounced as the Thursday offering at
the Grand.
The main setting of the picture is
a lonely farmhouse. There's a closet
off the main bedroom on the ground
floor that gives access to it from the
garret through a hidden trap door.
Mr. Power appears as the farmer,
a morose, brooding, discontented man.
The land all about is barren-looking
and the farm is breaking the man's
spirit. One day his unloved wife, a
piteous figure, is called away by her
sick sister. A woman, played by Lois
Weber, is left with her maid at the
lonely way station. There is no train
till the morning and they have to
spend the night at the haunted farm
house. There is excellent acting
through the early evening scene be
tween this woman and the farmer,
starved for the outer world. In the
night as she sleeps he makes use of
the trapdoor and kisses her hand. She
wakes in fright, but he is gone.
This is a very skilfully conceived
bit of business. It not only establish
es the hidden stair for use later in a
murder scene with lightning flashing
in at the windows, but is used at the
climax when the heroine, putting two
and two together, fastens the crime
where it belongs. For two men come
one stormy night and ask for shelter.
They have much money. One goes 10o
eleap in the bed, while the other
watcehes in the other room with the
door closed. A hair raising murder is
committed .and the second man,
wounded by the farmer, doesn't know
just what happened and is convicted
of the crimee.'iAkfi the strange Wo
man's husband. The "Eye of God" is
seen looking down on the murderer,
who dares not live in the house and is
chased out over the world to be finally
compelled to confess after the heroine
has found him out, and gives himself
up.
E. H. Sothern in "The Chattel."
"The Chattel," a five-reel Blue Rib
bon feature in which E. H. Sothern
makes his debut upon the screen, will
be shown at the Grand next Friday.
Blake Waring is a powerful finan
cier whose life code is "I must and
will have the best. For it I will pay
any price and count the cost fair." He
buys his wife the same as he would
buy any other chattel, and when she
inadvertently breaks one of his ty
rannical rules he tells her she must
obey, as he has bought and paid for
her. The story shows how the wife
obtains two hundred and fifty thou
sand dollars--the sum advanced by
Waring to save her father from finan
cial ruin-repays Waring and runs
away to hide her heartache. A re
conciliation follows, the issue being
never in doubt. As Leila Waring
loves her husband in spite of the ego
tism that has dried up his soul, her
return to her home and to newly
awakened appreciation is a source of
general satisfaction.
The production merits nothing but
praise. The locations, and the taste
displayed in everything connected
with the mounting of the picture, re
dound to the credit of the director.
The scenes of social life are particu
larly authentic.
Peggy Hyland impersonates War
ing's wife. She is the embodiment of
a beautiful, refined, high-spirited and
loyal woman, and realizes every situa
tion and every phase of the character
to the utmost. Her gowns also de
aerve a word of praise. Rose E. Tap
!by, Charles Kent, John Lark Taylor
and Florence Radinoff help to main
tain the performance at a gratifying
level of excellence.
Coming Triangle Attractions at the
Gem Theatre.
Today-W. S. Hart in "The Apostle
of Vengeance."
Sunday-Lillian Gish in "An Inno
cent Magdalene."
Friday-Roscoe Arbuckle in "The
Waiter's Ball," and Chester Conklin
in "His First False Step," Triangle
Keystone comedies. Also Pathe
News.
Saturday-Frank Keenan and Enid
Markey in "The Phantom."
Sunday, Oct. 29-Mae Marsh and
Robert Harron in "A Wild Girl of the
Sierras."
Real Rainstorm Pictured.
Several of the little touches of real
ism for which Thomas H. Ince is noted
appear in "The Apostle of Ven
geance," in which William S. Hart
will be seen at the Gem today.
One of the most striking scenes in
the production is a fierce rainstorm in
the mountains. Ince ha made many
rainstorms for the screen, but in the
majority of instances he has been
compelled to resort to cinematogra
phic tricks. In "The Apostle of Ven
geance," however, there is depicted
an actual storm. Hart and his com
pany were filming some interiors, one
day, when a terrific storm broke sud
denly in the mountains adjoining.
Hurriedly, the actor-director changed
his apparel to that prescribed in the
manuscript, and gathering those of
his company that were needed he
hastened into the mountains. There
was just sufficient light for photo
gnraphy and for forty minutes tl
troupe labored in a torrent of rain.
Another striking bit of realism is a
stone wall, of the sort that abounds
in the Kentucky mountains. Califor
nia has no stone walls-at least, not
in the vicinity of Inceville-so Ince
found it expedient to build one.
Still a third scene that counterfeits
the actual thing is a moonshine whis
key still in the mountains. The ap
purtenances for this set were sent to
Inceville from a hamlet in Kentucky.
"An Innocent Magdalene."
The Sunday offering at the Gem
will be "An Innocent Magdalene,"
with captivating Lillian Gish in the
leading role.
Dorothy Raleigh is a high-spirited
southern beauty who has been brought
up by her father, Colonel Raleigh, an
unreconstructed Kentuckian, to have
nothing to do with the people of the
little village of Norwalk, just outside
of Louisville. She has no other com
panions than the old negro servants,
her pets and her books.
One day there comes into her life
by chance a young millionaire gam
bler named Forbes Stewart. He
makes love to her and asks her fath
er for her hand. Indignant at his
presumption, the colonel orders him
from the house. But the young peo
ple elope.
When Dorothy meets her husband's
friends, she is grievously disappoint
ed. He sees that she is right, and de
termines to give up his fast life. A
detective who knows something of his
past tries to. blackmail him. His defi
ance leads to his arrest, and he is sen
tenced to a year in the penitentiary.
Dorothy is loyal to him at first, but
when another woman enters her home
and seemingly proves that she is Stew
art's wife by an earlier marriage,
Dorothy goes back to her father. But
the stern old man has disowned her,
and she is compelled to go to live in a
cabin with her old negro mammy.
When Stewart is released from the
penitentiary, he hastens home to find
his wife. Instead, he finds this other
woman, an aid flame who tries to win
him back again. He repudiates her,
however, and hurries to Norwalk to
see the colonel, and demand Dorothy.
The colonel refuses to tell her where
abouts; but from an old servant,
Stewart learns the truth. Dorothy,
in the meantime, has been led to be
lieve her baby illegitimate; and the
villagers, glad to see the proud name
of the Raleighs dragged in the dust.
make her life miserable. She is about
to kill herself, when Stewart arrives.
The outcome reunites the lovers, and
brings a change in the heart of the
father that is supremely satisfying.
"The Phantom."
Not since the days of the famous
"Raffles" series has there been a de
tective story so exciting, so full of
adventure, as "The Phantom," in
which Frank Keenan and Enid Markey
will appear at the Gem next Saturday.
It's a Triangle play, full of surprises,
replete with quick action and tense
moments. If you enjoy this kind of
a story (and who doesn't?) this pic
ture will surely "get" you. Few plays
have equalled it.
A verdict of $30,000 has been ren
dered against the Louisville and Nash
ville Railroad Company by a jury at
Bay St. Louis for the killing of Miss
Georgette Brandao by a passing train
several months ago. The damage suit
was instituted by the young lady's
father, E. A. Brandao, a clerk in the
United States sub-treasury at New
Orleans, and the amount claimed was
$60,000.
President Wilson has reftsed to al
ter his expressed determination not
to make stumping tours in support of
his own candidacy for re-election.
With the exception of a few addresses
at central points, he will confine his
campaigning to speeches to visitors
at his summer home, Shadow Lawn,
Long Branch, N. J., and the writing
of letters in reply to questions involv
ed in the pending contest.
If you believe in helping those who
hllp you it's your duty to buy at
home.

BED-TIME STORIES
By Master Bernard Lemann
(Exactly as written)
The Circus Has Come to Town!
"Hurrah!" shouted the crowd of
people, hurrying across the field to
the ticket office in front of a large
tent. "The circus has come to town "
As the people were buying their
tickets, a barefoot girl with a tatter
ed dress stood watching the merry
mob. She wished she could see the
lions and clowns, but she needed all
her money to support her invalid
mother.
A little boy and girl, dressed in
quaint clothes, walked up to buy their
tickets, noticed the barefoot girl who
was standing nearby.
S,"Would you like to go in with us?"
asked the girl, who was older than
the boy.
"I would love to go," exclaimed the
barefoot child, cheering up.
"Mother gave us some spare money
and it is just enough to buy a ticket
for you," she said. "Give me three
t'ickets, please."
So they went into the tent and sat
lown on a long bench.
"Here they start!" cried the boy.
The parade passed the long bench
on which they sat. The elephants,
the tigers, the clowns and last of all
came a mule dressed in pants. How
the children laughed!
"See those acrobats!"
"Hear the steam piano!"
"Look!"
"How beautiful, and great, and
fine!" exclaimed the barefoot girl,
for she had never seen a circus be
fore. She didn't know what a lion
was. She seemed as if she were in
Paradise!
At last the big show was over and
the children walked out of the tent
hand in hand, talking of the tricks
and stunts they had seen.
"Please come and see my mother,"
said the barefoot girl. "I'm sure she
will be glad to see you."
"We will be happy to go," said the
two together.
So they went to the cottage and the
barefoot girl opened the door and
walked in, leaving the two without.
"I have a big surprise for you,
mother," she said. *
"What is the surprise?" asked the
woman.
"Look," said the girl as she opened
the door.
"Oh, what sweet children!" cried
the woman. "What are your names?"
"Our names are Mary and Robert
DeLoan," they said.
"DeLoan!" said the woman, very
much surprised. "Are you related to
Herbert DeLoan?"
"He is our father," thy'ifj'l
"Your father!" she exclaimed.
"Then you are my niece and nephew.
Herbert DeLoan is my long lost broth
er. Go home and tell him you have
found me."
So the children went home and told
their father about the new-found
aunt. That very afternoon an auto
mobile drove up to the door of the
cottage and the woman's brother
stepped out of it. They were soon
in each other's arms.
The woman and her girl rode back
with the man and found the children
and their mother waiting for them.
The woman lived with her brother
and happiness brought back her
health.
Belle Rose Citizens Add Their Praise.
Another link with our neighboring
town of Belle Rose is provided in the
following grateful and generous
statement of a well-known resident
there, Mr. Lauve, who says:
E. E. Lauve, postmaster, Belle
Rose, La., says: "LaGrippe weaken
ed my kidneys and I had difficulty in
retaining the kidney secretions. They
contained much sediment and were
unnatural. My back was so stiff that
I took to bed. My eyes were swollen
most of the time. Doctors could do
nothing and neither did. the remedies
I tried help me. I then began taking
Doan's Kidney Pills and although I
had run down in weight to one hun
dred and thirty-one pounds, I im
proved so steadily that in a short
time I weighed one hundred and six
ty-five pounds. I have remained at
that weight ever since. My kidneys
are now normal and I don't have any
trouble from my back."

Ouachita Road Bonds Above Par.
The police jury of Ouachita parish
recently advertised for bids for the
purchase of a bond issue of $500,000,
the proceeds of which are to be ex
pended ingthe construction of model
roads in that parish. Seven propo
sals were received, all of them offer

from $410 to $3000. The best bid
was that of the Hibernia Bank and

it was accepted. One of the condi
tions of the proposal is that the $500,
000 road fund shall be deposited in
equal shares with the Ouachita Na

RURAL SCHOOLS IN GOOD SHAPE
Ascension's Educational System Undergoing Changes
That Mean Better Things for the Children-Numer
ous Improvements Effected in Past Year-Standard
of Teaching Corps Raised and Physical Conditions
Bette'red--Increase in Enrollment and Attendance.
The results of a careful and com- f,
prehensivee survey of the rural d
schools of Ascension parish, recently tl
completed by Inspector John M. Foote rt
of the field force of the state depart- ir
ment of education, are thus summar- c:
ized in a report submitted by that e:
official: fi
Preliminary Statement. n
The schools of this parish were pre- .,
viously inspected and reported on in d
November, 1915. At that time Super- h
intendent H. P. Broussard had just tl
assumed charge of the schools. We g
noted with much interest that during n
the past year many features relating
to the organization of an efficient
system of schools for the parish have i
been initiated successfully.
The attention of the reader is di- t
rected to the fact that the following $
report deals principally with the or- i
ganization of the several schools, 9
their teachers, attendance, grade lim
itation, daily programs, playground 1
supervision, consolidation, sanitary
conditions, tests in several of the ele
mentary subjects, observation of the
work, etc. Description of the various s
physical features, as, appeared in the c
previous report, is given only briefly i
and sometimes omitted, as it is unnec
essary to repeat much that has been
previously reported. Mention is made
of the improvement of physical con
ditions. s
St. Amant. t
The two teachers employed here n
hold second grade certificates, are ex- t
perienced, receive $60 and $40 per n
month, and are both rendering very f
satisfactory service. The primary a
teacher is serving her third session in t
this district. Of ninety-six pupils en- g
rolled ninety-two were in attendance. s
The grades are limited to seven at F
'present, but in a short time an addi- a
tional teacher will be put in to pro- a
vide for the large enrollment and the r
grade limit will be raised accordingly. l:
Due to the consolidation during the s
summer of a small school and the par- f

were gone over with the teachersan
detail and some few changes recom
mended. Supervised play has so far
taken the form of supervised work,
as the teachers and pupils have been
busy putting the premises in orderly
condition; later more attention will
be given to the teaching of organized
games and play. We found the li
brary to be very much in need of ad
ditional books, especially supplement
ary readers for the several grades.
The pupils in the fourth and fifth
grades were tested in reading and
arithmetic. The reading, which was
from familiar lessons in the adopted
text, ranks as average, with some pu
pils reading poorly. The arithmetic
consisted of six comparatively easy
examples in addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division. The
eighteen pupils averaged twenty-sev
en per cent and the average time-re
quired to do the work was twenty
three minutes per pupil. But one
pupil worked all of the six examples
and it is of interest to note that the
work was done in the shortest time,
eleven minutes. The results indicate
very plainly that the pupils do not
know the four fundamental opera
ons. As the papers were graded be
fore leaving the school the teacher
and superintendent were duly im
pressed with the condition and both
agreed that the necessary steps would
be taken to teach these operations
t fully during the session. It was also
agreed that no efforts would be spared
t in placing proper emphasis on the
teaching of both reading and arithme
tic. The session here will be nine
months instead of the usual six
t months' term that has prevailed in the
t past. As this is the case with all the
t schools, the parish must be congratu
lated upon having found means to
lengthen the session to nine months
for all schools.

The two teachers employed are ex
perienced graduates of the State Nor
mal, receive $55 and $45 per month,
and are giving good service to the
school and community. Forty-seven
pupils are enrolled in six grades, with
an attendance of forty-three. The
pact that the compulsory attendance
law is now in effect has been duly an
nounced to all the pupils and the com
munity. The teachers will make in
quiry and visit any families that do
not enroll their children. The policy
of the parish board and superintend
ent for the present session will be
to fully inform all parents regarding
the law and invite them to send their
children. The daily programs are
well arranged and indicate that the
course of study is being adhered to
rigidly. More attention than in the
past will be given to organized plays
and games and the supervision of the
pupils while on the grounds. By reg
ulation of the board and the superin
tendent grade limitation is strictly
enforced. The library contains 200
volumes. This will receive additions
;luring the session, as the teachers are
planning to raise funds to purchase a
supply of supplementary readers in
;ets for the several grades. An ex
imination of the penmanship and
-peliing indicated that very satisfac
iory progress is being made in these
subjects. The Palmer syterm of writ
ing is being taught. Tests in reading
showed that a few of the pupils have
been well trained and that others are
fair readers. Tests in the four fun
diamental operations of addition, sub
traction, multiplication and division
resulted in the fourth and fifth Aades
making an average of twenty-tW5 per
cent. The time required to work six
examples varied from fifteen to forty
five minutes. The teachers will give
more attention to the work in arith
metic. As indicated in the previous
report on this school the physical con
ditions are exceptionally good. The
house is a splendid brick structure,
the furnishings are modern, and the
grounds are fenced and well orna
mented.

Both of the teachers at this school
hold first grade certificates, have at
tended summer schools to improve
their scholarship and training, receive "
$55 and $40 per month, and seem to
be doing very satisfactory service.
Sixty-three pupils were in attendance
out of an enrollment of sixty-five.
This very high percentage of attend
ance is to be commended. The grades
are limited to seven. The daily pro
grams were carefully examined and
some few minor recommendations for
changes made. The teachers are tak
ing more than the usual interest in
upervising the playground by teach
ing the pupils various games and
spending the recess time in the yard
with the children. The course of
study is carefully followed. The
teachers realize the need of supple
mentary reading matter to assist in
teaching reading, geography and com
munity studies, and expect to raise
funds during the session to purchase
additional books for the library. The
tests given to the fourth and fifth
grades in reading and arithmetic
showed that in the first subject the
pupils averaged fair, while in
arithmetic they were all poor. We
advised with the teachers regarding
more effective work in these very im
portant subjects. A flowing well and
sanitary fountain supplies water of
fine quality. The house is fairly sub
stantial and adequate, but is not of
modern design. It is in need of paint
ing and a few minor repairs. With
the addition of more desks, a case of
maps and more books for the library
the equipment will be quite ample.

The principal and assistant are
graduates of high schools, have at
tended one summer school, and hold
first and second grade certificates re
spectively. Only four pupils were
absent of an enrollment of ninety
four. The grades are now limited to
five, the pupils above going to Dutch
town, but we would recommend that
an additional teacher be placed in the
school as the attendance is now too
great for two teachers, and follow
ing this raise the grade limit to seven
or eight. As the first step toward
the enforcement of the compulsory
attendance law the teachers will can
vass the families of the district and
report any pupils out of school to the
superintendent and parish board.
Very little trouble is anticipates in
this community as practically all the
children have been enrolled. Some
have enrolled directly as a result of
the law requiring attendance. The
tests given in reading and arithmetic
showed approximately the same re
sult as at the other schools. Ways
and means for improving the work in
the fundamental subjects was fully
discussed with the teachers. The
physical conditions here are quite
satisfactory. The building is a neat
ly constructed four-room house, paint
ed, and kept in good sanitary condi
tion.
Belle Helene.
A first grade teacher of two years'
experience enrolled twenty-four pu
pils in four grades. Every pupil was
in attendance at the time of our visit;
a fine record. As in the other schools
reported, the teacher is taking the pre
liminary steps for the enforcement of
the compulsory attendance law. The
tests in reading and arithmetic showed
that several of the pupils read quite
well, while the arithmetic resulted in
a very unsatisfactory average for the
grades. As permanent gravel roads
will be constructed in a short time we
recommend that this school be aban
doned and the pupils transferred to
Dutchtown.
Geismar.
A very competent seco'd1 grade
teacher is serving her third session
here. Seventeen out of the eighteen
pupils enrolled were in attendance.
- The grades are limited to five. The
- daily program is as well arranged as
can be expected under the conditions.
The teacher reports that she gives due
attention to the supervision of the
e layground and the teaching of games.

WEAK, AILIUN CHILD
Made Strong By Delicious Vinol
Lakeport, N. II.--"Our little girl 8
years of age was in a debilitated, run
down condition and had a stubborn
cough so she was weak and ailing all
the time. Nothing helped her until
we tried Vinol. Then her appetite
increased and she is strong and well, and
I wish other parents of weak, delicate
children would _try ,Vinol."--GUo. A,

This is because Vinol contains beet

manganese , peptonates and glyosrog
phosphates which she needed.
