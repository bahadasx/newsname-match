NEW BOMB CASE AFFIDAVIT
UPHOLDS FRAME-UP CHARGE
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 19.—Threats of arrest and imprisonment
were used by the district attorney's office to secure the retraction of
affidavits favorable to Warren K. Billings was the charge in a sworn
statement presented to Superior Judge Frank Dunne by Attorney
Maxwell McNutt, Billings' lawyer.
The ne)v affidavit, upholding his original testimony, was signed by
Dan D. Donaldson, whose testimony was depended on to build an
alibi for Billings at a retrial, so far as his presence at 721 Market
street on the day of the bomb explosion was concerned
In the new affidavit Donaldson stated that shortly after his
original affidavit was read in court Ppliceman Draper Hand came to
Vallejo and insisted on his coming to the hall of justices in this city
to discuss his affidavit.
At the hall of justce, he said, Brennan joined the party who ques­
tioned him about his first affidavit, and told him he was liable to be
locked up, with no chance of bail, if he did not change his affi­
davit. He refused to make the change demanded, saying his affidavit
was true to the best of his knowledge.
Early this week, rrmaii=rm
Donaldson says,
five men called on the Mare Island
commandant and said that "unless
the affidavit was straightened out the
judge would issue a warrant for my
arrest on a charge of perjury."
After repeated threats, Donaldson
asserts, the five, among whom was
Assistant District Attorney Edward
Cunha, took him to the office of
Mayor Rooney in Vallejo and made
him sign a new affidavit, repudiating
the one he had given ,to McNutt.
New Trial Refused.
"Cunha and Officer Hand stated
that unless I repudiated my affidavit
I would be arrested and held on such
bail that I couldn't get out, and Mc­
Nutt would not be man enough to ap­
pear and bail me out," read Donald­
son's affidavit. "I never slept lor two
nights worrying over the darn thing,"'
he added. "Cunha insisted that tell
him about the money end—how much
you had promised me or how much I
got from you. I told him that I had
never been offered any money or re­
ceived any money for my affidavit.
The original affidavit was correct to
the best of my knowledge."
Other affidavits favorable to Bill­
ings were prrsented, but Judge Dunne
refused to credit them, refused a new
trial, and sentenced Billings to life
imprisonment.
The convicted man's appeal that he
sent to San Quentin was denied by
the judge. He was granted a stay of
execution to allow his attorneys time
to file an appeal for a new trial with
the appellate court.

CAN YOU BEAT IT?
EAST ST. LOUIS, 111., Oct. 19.
—Track laborers employed by
the East St. Louis & Suburban
railway must cither pay for dodg­
ing: street cars or dispute the
Tight of way of these convey­
ances.
Company officials produced
figures to show that each man
lost time aggregating one hour a
day stepping out of the trenches

The employes refused to accept
this stop watch system of mathe­

"NEW YORK, Oct. 19.—"The eight
hour day has increased our earnings
by millions and made our men better
off," said Henry Ford in an interview
with a local newspaper.
"I'm going to spread the gospel of
the eight-hour working day," he said,
."by public announcements and by
public display of actual figures and
statistics taken from the books of my
own business.
"When you get down to eight hours
you observe a wonderful increase of
efficiency. When we put it into ef­
fect our product simply skyrocketed
in output. The men are full of effi­
ciency, life, ginger. They feel this
way: 'Weil, here's eight hours of hus-
I'll hustle, and earn my fair wage,
le.
and then I've got all' the rest of the
time to myself. I can improve my­
self. I'm not worn out, tied down.
I'm a man.'
At this point the motor-maker
handed out a free tip to the railroad
operators.
"Tell them to diminish the weight
of their rolling stock. Use better,
lighter steel. There's plenty of it, and
it costs only a trifle more than the
bad, heavy stuff they now use. They
can cut the weight of their car3 in
half, carry more freight and passen­
gers, "make more money, use less fuel,
and avoid wear and tear on their
roadbeds. "\Y:hy, there is no greater
Taste
in the United States than the
waste of weight in steel
"Any business man who can's make
the eight-ho^ir day pay is not manag­
ing his business property."

FIR HOUR DAY
By P. G. PHILLIPS.
Former Alderman of Duluth.
What should be the length of the
work day is a question that is being
brought prominently "before the
minds of many people who have in
the past g'ven the question little
thought.
It has at last become the issue in
labor circles, and has traveled a long
way on its journey towards its uni­
versal goal. Those of us who have
fought for it as a principle were ridi­
culed and scoffed at because of our
persistence in its establishment.
But why the eight-hour day? Why
not the seven, the six, the five or
the four? Who shall say what the
length of the work day shorld be?
Surely it would be of interest to the
workers to see it established, but to
the employers it would be a millstone
around their necks.
The, struggle that is continually in
progress between the workers' on the
one hand and the employers on the
other, is nothing more or less than
the interest of one class strugglirg
against the interests of another class,
the one demanding more wages, the
other demanding more, work, the one
attempting to reduce 'the hours, the
other atte'ttipfing. "keep../the old*
standard.-
The employ**' in1 many cases is" quite
a humane fellow, is a fellow of feel­
ing, pr in other words a good man,
and yet he is powerless as a rule in
the establishment of shorter hours,
because of his social and financial
ties, that will not allow him to live
in peace and continue in business.
There may be exceptions to this rule,
but they are rare.
Why should not the worker be a
partner in the business why should
he not have a say in its management.
Surely {his would not appear to be un­
fair in view of the fact that he is
the greatest factor in the produc­
tion of wealth.
One thing is sure. Labor will not
give up its fight for the reduction of
hours and the increase in wages, until
society readjusts the relationship be­
tween the worker and the employer
and places both of them upon an
equal basis, in which neither ihas the
advantage.
LITERARY DIGEST POLL

their organization's sentiment. Of the
457, some 337 reported as favoring
Wilson, 47 favor Benson, the Socialist

'The Democratic party, led by Woodrow Wilson, has done more for
the country in three and a half years than the .Republican party has done
in five times as many years."
This is the statement made by Dr. Charles W. Eliot, president emeri­
tus of Harvard Universtity and printed in the Atlantic Monthly magazine.
"President Wilson," continues the article, "has also proved himself
to be a party leader of unusual power. The Democratic party in three
and a half years have accomplished an extraordinary series of legislative
and executive acts."
A statement made by Richard Olney in the New York World, says the
following:
"As the Supreme Court candidate say what he would have not done,
if in President's Wilson's place, or what he will do in case he succeeds
him—as he is only-certain-of-the wrongfulness of everything the adminis­
tration has done—his inducement to change our foreign policies will be
great. Will it be a change to suit Germany? Or have the country get into
some sort of fight?"

NEW YORK, Oct. 19.—Yonkers
Railway company closed its barns to­
day and abandoned their attempts to
run street cars after the common
council refused to repeal the ordi­
nance forbidding motormen to oper­
ate street cars unless they had fifteen
days employment. This is taken as
a signal victory by the striking cat
men.
Trainmen of the Hudson and Man­
hattan road, ^ube employes who are
members of the Brotherhood of
Trainmen, voted to go on a strike
when the company discharged a
number of men for belonging to the

company's "union." The company
gave in, the men being reinstated and
the brotherhood did not strike.

NEW YORK, Oct. 19.—Earnings of
$20,000,000 annually are expected by
the Cuba Cane Supar corporation.
This, according to The Wall'Street
Journal,, is six times the dividend re­
quirements of the preferred stock arid
means an annual surplus of $33 a
share on the common stock.
A circular issued by the company:
"For the immediate future, and prob­
ably during the next few yfcars, the
price of sugar may be expected to
hold materially above the average
figures of the past. The sugar mar­
ket now forming for deliveries in the
coming year indicates that a price at
least as high as the average for the
past year should be realized for the
1916-1917 output of the Cuba- Cane
Sugar corporation."
Controls Other Property.
"The Cuban Cane Sugar corporation
was a strong, sound conception in the
beginning it has been made still
stronger r.nd sounder by the acquisi­
tion of the- properties of the Stewart
Sugar company."
"Cuban sugar, o. b.- Cuba, costs
$.0185 a pound, or $.0195 a pound,
New York." (Figures for. 1910.)
These figures are taken from
"Cuban Cane Sugar," published in
1916, for the express purpose of at­
tracting the attention of American
capital to the possibilities of sugar
production in Cuba, ..
Production Cost Reduced.
This book further says:
"Undoubtedly, in the six years
which have intervened, .the cost of
production has been still, furthe re­
duced."
Duluthians are paying 10 cents a
pound for sugar, according to a clerk
of the M. M. Gasser company, when
asked by a Labor World reporter.
Three years ago one could buy sugar
foc»five cents a pound.

held to determine, whether there1
would be a general walkout, but more'

ing eight more bluecoats handed in
their stars and declared that they
were through if riding the street cars
was made a part of their duty.
