HENRY C. FRICK
BUYS A RUBENS
"Portrait of Spinola"
Makes 104th Painting
He Has Bought
Henry C. Frick haa acquired another^
important old master, Rubens'a "Por
trait of the Matquis Ambrose de Spi- j
nola," it waa announced yesterday.
This is the Arai example of the art af
the Flemish master to be obtained by j
Mr. Frick, whose great collection,
which it is understood will some day
become the property of the public, now
comprises 104 important paintings.
It is the second pieture Mr. Frick
has acquired in tiie present art season,
the other being Rembrandt's "Old
Woman Reflecting Over the Lecture,"
for which he paid $250,000.
The F'ubens was sold Mr. Frick by
M. Kr.oedler &. Co., who declined to
make the price public.
Mr. Frick is credited by the art
world with having the desire durin,.
his lifetime to form the greatest art
collection in the United States, one
that will eclipse the J. Picrpont Mor?
gan collection.
Th? work by Rubens is an historical
portrait of the greatest interest, oe
cause Spinola was the Spanish general
who defeated the Dutch and put the;
Netherlaada under the Spat.ish yoke.
.- the hero of the siege of Breda,
which wa? immortali'ed by Vela?quer, |
rn his maaterpiece, "The _^irrendcr of
Breda." now la the Museum of thc
Prado, Madnd.
Mr. Frick also possesses another
highly important historrcal portrait of
about the same time, Velpsquea'a por?
trait 'rf the Emperor Philip IV. H?
has placed the Rubens in his gallery
by the side of Rembrandt's portrait of
himself.
Spinola is presented three-quarters
length in a warlike costume. but not in

two other portraits still in Kuropean
eolleetiona. Tha pieture was painted
by Rnbenfl, flapertfl aay, about 1020,
with no aaeiatenee from his pupils,,ks

SING SING GUN
HUNT BEGUN;
6 WEN CAUGHT
Easy to Smuggle Wea
pons In, Says One
Who Fled Prison
75 INSIDE, HE
TELLS CAPTORS
Osborne Blames Whitman
and Carter for Their
"Trifling"
While the prison authorities were
conducting a rigid investigation to de?
termine where two of the six prisoner.
who eseaped from Sing: Sing on Thurs?
day obtained revolvera, and from what
source they got a change of clorfiing,
every available guard and employe was
set to work yesterday to ferret out
weapons alleged still to be hidden
within the penitentiery walla.
The hunt began even before the last
pf the men had been captured and re?
turned to the institution. Maurice
Curtis, the convict who was shot by
Joseph Birdsall. a guard, near I'ocan
tico Hills, said no fewer than aeventy
five revolvers were concealed within the
prison. It was Curtis, the man who
drove the truck in which the six es?
eaped, and conceded to be the brains of ]
the gang, who was feared most by th-j
guards.
Thought He Would Die
When he was ehot he thought he
had been mortally wounded.
"Why didn't you shoot me in the
head and have it over?" he asked.
Thinking he was anout to die, he
readily told the guards the direction
taken by his companions. When asked
where he had obtained the revolver he
asserted it was easy to smuggle weap?
ons __to the prison. Since the acreens,
which formerly separated visitor and
prisoner, had been removed, he ex?
plained, a person coming into the per.i
tentiary could pass anything to a prii
-orrrr.
"There are aeventy-five more ln
there," he sald, "but you won't find 'em
ll the cells."
Jay Crowley, asslstant to Acting
Warden Calvin Derrick, characterized
the report as an absurdity, but admit
tad since the screens have been taken
down in the visitors' room strangers
might have eluded the watchfulness of
the guards on occasions.
A month ago, however, it il known
Thomas Mott Osborne, then warden,
caused an investigation to be mnde
when he received a rumor from out?
side sources that certain prisoners pos
sessed four revolvers. Frank Luti.one
of the men who eseaped, was brought
before the inmates' court at that tirffe
and ordered to tell what he knew of
thc whereabouts of the weapons.
Convlct Changes Manner
When Curtis's injury was dress'd
by Dr. Thomas Barry in the nrison
hospital and he had been informed it
was little more than a flerh wound and
would not prove serioU3, the convj-t
changed his manner nnd b?camc
facctious.
Crowley was inelined to believe the
escape had been planned on thi *pur
of the moment, that the idea was sug
gested by Curtis when he saw the
heavy rain and the truck standing le
neath a thed in the north end of the
yard. a
Curtis has been known to think
quickly before. Once, while in Clinton i
prison, ho saw a claw hammer on a ;
guard's table. He complaincd of hav
ing a Bail in his Bhoe that hurt him.
'Ihe guard handed him the hammer,
and that was the last he remembered
until he r-gain.-d ronsciousness many
hour* later in the prison hospital.
< urtis struck hnn over the head,
grabbed his revolver and wounded sev?
erai persons before he was ovtrpow
a red.
Mr. Derrick e.pressrd the belief that
the escapo had heen planned long be?
fore it occurrcd. The fact that the
men had hlddefl the change of clothing
in the tool chest. ** the truck, together
with the revolvers, and had stolen the
cap worn by William Arison from a
I'luird named NelaOfl some time ago
ihowed this to be true. he pointed out.
I.ivee Credit to Guarda
Whea romplimented by James M.
< artBr, State Superintendent of Pris?
ons, on the capture of the men, he said
rredit was due ( rowley and the corps
of guards.
"We have a good force here and there
ia nothing wrong with the system," he
._% "All that. is needed is a redis
tribntiOfl ef guards at certain, points
A thorough investigation is being mad'*
-__ to how the mon obtained the
VOapoaa. thia has not been deter?
mined as yet."
Kx -Warden Oiborne, speaking on
prieea reform at Hryant Hall, attnb
Bted the escape to the fact that"Super
iritendont < arter and Governor Whit?
man were trifling with the inrnatea at
tl.r- prison."
Wbii-i be praised Mr. Derrick and his
force f-,r the capture, he said the peo?
ple of the stay must realixe there wai
? groat inrerilive to make a man escape
i whon h ? began lO fear "ho won't get a
s<_uaic drel."
WHEAT STILL SOARING,
EMBARGO IS SOUGHT
Chieago Bakers Move to Stop
Exports
Chieago, Oet. 20.?Wheat continued
to break records on the Board of Trade
to-day, and for the second time this
week seemed to threaten the hlgh-water
! mark set in 1898, when Joseph Leiter
cornered the market.
B. H. Dahlheimer, president of th?
Master Bakers' Association of Chieago,
announced that the association wil!
meet on Monday to start a campaign to
obtain a Federal embargo on the export
of wheat and flour until the domestic
situation is relieved, asking the aid of
members of Congress.
Miss Florence King, of the Woman's
Association of Commerce, announced
the intention of that organization to
send at once a committee to the I'nited
j States District Attorney to protest, in
, the name of the women of fhicago,
against the rising prices of wheat and
flour.

DETECTIVE* SHOT,
KEEPSUPPURSUIT
Four Bullets Required to
Halt His Chdse After
Fleeing Pair
Detective Daniel Van Dam. ef In?
spector Morris's staff, kept right on
last night after one bullet from a flee?
ing gunj-an's revolver had carried away
his hat and another had sliced the tip
c>fT his left ear. Even after a third bul?
let had smashed his right shoulder and
a fourth had lodged in his chest, Van
Dam managed to continue the pursuit
?mother half block and to empty his
irwn revolver before he eollapsed.
The shooting, which occurred in Kast
Iflfil Street, had been preceded by the
arret>t of Benjamin Braehhausen, a j
striking conductor, of 1883 Lexington j
Avenue. With his partner, Detective |
Charles McN'ulty, Van Dam had caught
the striker nt N'inety-seventh Street |
and I/exington Avenue after a street
car had been stoned.
Arcompenies Detectives
A* the two detectives entered the
Kast 10.th Street police station with
their prisoner they were accompanied
by William Heineman, of 162 East
Ninety-seventh Street, a sergeant in
Commissioner Woods's new Home De?
fenee League.
A ery of "Stop, thlef!** halted Van
Dam and Heineman. A pickpocket ai
it then appeared--had been at work in
the crowd which had followed Braeh?
hausen to the station house.
Van Dam, turning in time to see an
undersiied man breaking out of the
throng and raeing eastward, took up
the pursuit. So did Heineman. Young
er and fleeter of foot than Van Dam,
who is forty, the amateur policeman
outstripped the detective.
The chase led north on Third Avenue
for a block and then east again. The
fugitive had increased his lead and
was able to dodge into a bicycle ?hop
nt 24.1 East 105th Street and out again
before Heineman came up. Severai
other men ran out of the store and
blocked the way. One, said by thc po?
lice to have been Angclo Milone, part
owner of the shop, had a revolver.
Defenee Sergeant Falls
It was at Heineman the first shot
was aimed. He ducked, slipped and
fell.. Van Dam continued the chase
alone, his own revolver drawn. The
gunman had followed in the f otsteps
of the fugitive friend, racmg east
toward First Avenue and firing over his
shoulder. Van Dam, with wounds that
might have meant instant death to a
weaker man, .ot. to the middle of the
avenue before his strength gave out.
Ho eollapsed on the car track.
The gunman and the supposed pick?
pocket completed their escape before
the reserve. began to comb the dis?
trict for them. According to the po?
lice. the second man was recognized as
Louis Marino, of tU Kast 105th
Stre.t. He was charged with having
beea an accessory to the shooting.
The man who had raised the ery of
"Stop. thief!" was not to be found
afterward. and the police now believe
the trouble in front of the station
house may have been a ru<e to give
Braehhausen a chance to get away.
Van Dam was taken to Metropolitan
Hoapital. Ha has a Bghting chance
for life. ,,. . ?__

Suggestion That Visit

MILITARY CHIEFS
REFUSE TO TALK
People, Promised Light,
Startled by Sudden
New Order
Hslifax, N. B. Oet. 20. All lights,!
except a few shaded ones in the west
and north ends, have again been or-j
dered turned off in the streets of this
city at night, and all blinds must be
drawn, according to orders just sent
out from military headquarters.
Whether a visit from a transatlantic
Zeppelin or an attack from the sea by
enemy warcraft is feared is not known.
"The lights will be turned out because
the naval and military authorities feel
that it is necessary," i? the only state?
ment made by headquarters.
Citizens who have fretted over the
necessity of makiog their way through
dimly lit streets were cheered when
city officials announced on Thursday
that the light would soon be turned on
again. but later the military authorities
made it known that the resumption of
straat li.hting was to be only tempo-1
rary, and that it was for tbe purpose of
testing thc visibility of the lights from
the sea, the basin and the harbor.
To an inquiry as to why the order
of "lights out" did not apply to St.
John, N. B., as well as to this city, the
reply was made at military headquar?
ters:
"Oh, well, you kno* St. John is not
as important as Halifax."
Paumors in circulation since th- raide
of the U-H off Nantucket declared
I'-boats intended to carry their warfare
to the coasts of Canada. If so, it is
thonght Halifax would be the first to
suffcr.
The first Intimation that German
submarines were operating, or intende i
to operate, off the Canadian coast was
furnished by August Thyssen, the Ger?
man financier, in an interview on Octo
ber 12. In a statement predicting th"
renewal of submarine warfare under
restricted conditions Herr Thyssen
said:
"Germany's pre.ent U*boet warfare
off Canada undoubtedly is di-agreeaole
for Americans. F.very one must be
prepared to see a commander occasion
ally overstep his instruction and make
mietakes, but no one here wants
trouble, and it can be counred upon that
Berlin will keep its word."

London, Oct. 20. The lailin-* of the

to an Exchange Telegraph dispatch

said, to the great anxiety felt for the

Infant Plague Serum
on Missing Bremen

Baltimore. Oct. 20. In addition te a
Icrger cargo of dyestuff* than the
D? utschland brought and medicines '
badly needed in America the missing |
merchant submarine Bremen is said to,
have had aboard a serum for infantile;
paralysis, which had been found ef-'
fective in ('ermany.
"While we have no absolute word t*\
that effect, we believe the Bremen was
bringing the serum," said Paul Hilken, |
the Ameriean manager of the Deutsche
Oeean Rhedereia, owners ot* the Ger?
man merchant submarines, to-day.
Mr. Hilken returned to Baltimore this
morning from New London, Conn.,
where he has been waiting for weeks
the arrival of the Bremen. He made no
effort te i.ide the grief he felt over the
fate of the boat -of which he now has
Lttle doubt and of the deaths of thej
members of her crew thirty officers

Although tt has been reported that
tho fate of the Bremen has postponed

MUENSTERBERG SEES
CZAR WITH KAISER IN 17
Asserts New Alliance Will Fol?
low Separate Peaee
Cambridge, Mass., Oct. 20. Hugo
Muensterberg, professor of psychology
at Han-ard University, in an address
to-night before the International Polity
Club, of thc university, asserted that
he had been reliably informed that
Russia and Germany would aign terms
rf a separate peaee before spring, and
that following this peaee there would
be an alliance among Germany, Aus?
tria. Russia and Japan.
In this connection he said: "Russia
is out of joint, is half bankrupt, is
starving and will be ready for a sep?
arate peaee before spring. Japan and
Russia are pushing toward this com?
bination, and an overwhelming major?
ity of the German people would wel
come it to-day.
"It is the old Bismarcklan tradition
that Germany ought to be the friend
of Russia, and that sueh U alliance
would be her sureat protection.
"If we really want to bring peaee for
a generation there is no hope but to
bring Germany and England to an un?
derstanding before Germany and Russia
have formed an alliance. Neither the
English nor the German people want
this peaee to-day, but they ought to
want it, for once the new alliance is
formed it will seek to crush the ambi
tion of England for world power."

London, Oct. 20.?Muckensen has
opened a new offensive in the Do?

along the whole front in the Ruma?

Rumanian left wing, rcsting on the
Black Sea coast. The battle, whlrh
is as heavy as any of those which
marked his first drive, is still in
progress,

Balkan battle line?the task haa
fallen again.
Falkenhavn Thrust Back _^
Falkenhayn made severai fieree ef?
forts to-day to break the Rumanian

made additional progress in Hearing
l their country of the enemy, and drove
back the Teutona on the eastern line
as far as tho frontier.
The Serbians, who are battering at the
last Bulgarian line on the ridge ten
'miles east of Monastir, have held their
i ground. Berlin. concedu.g that they
| achieved a temporary aucccss, says the
I advance has now been halted. But
military observers here believe that
: whenever Kinc* Peter'a troopa decide
to launch a heavy drive tbe Bulgars
will not be able to withstand it.

operations I learned something to-day

The Serbians have not used their full
strength yet; their campaign is being
guided by Sarrail's orde-s.
