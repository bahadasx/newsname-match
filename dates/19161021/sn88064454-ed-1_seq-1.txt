Good Rain.
After several weeks of dry wea

put their corn and a large crop of
hay and pea-vine, a good rain fell
Monday morning, which will be of
much go(l to the cane, facilitating
the cutting and giving more juice
to the cane, and laying down the
dust, it will also be good for fall
planted cane and for windrowing.
