OFFERING RECIPROCITY
FOR CAMPAIGN CASH.
Norwalk, Conn., Nov. 4, 1914.
Mr. George W. Wilkic,
New York, N. 1.
Dear Mr. Wllkie: I am in re
ceipt of year telegram today and
have forwarded to Mr Hill a copy
of the same. He wishes me to
thank yon and through you the
Straw Braid association for their
assistance, and to say to yon that
he hopes when opportunity offers
to be able to reciprocate in a
measure by assisting in legislation
which will give us a little more
protection than we have at .the
present time. I personally appre
ciate very much what yon have
done, and feel that my friends have
been considerable help in the work
which I had to do. With kind re-'
gards to you, I am
v Tours, very truly, .
, ARTHUR C. WHEELER.
Lynn W. Wilson made two speeches,
lajst night, from' the text, "Who's pay
ing Hill's campaign bills this year?"
Mr. Wilson spoke to an ' overflow
meeting of 300 or 400 persons, on East
Main street, an) then -followed Hon.
Thomas L. Reilly, and Hon. Jeremiah
Donovatv before an audience of 4500
persona in Arco theatre, Bast Main
street. ' ' -
Mr. Wilson said: "I don't know
whether you rwant a man in Congress
who pays his oitn campaign Mils as
Congressman Donovan does; or wheth
er you want a man who has hU cam
paign expenses paid by other people,
as Mr. Hill does.
'We don't know who's paying Mr.
Hill campaign expenses this year. But
we Jo know who paid them In 1912.
We know where the money came from.
The facts are in the record. They're
sworn to. They're, stated under oath,
by the very men who gave the money.
"Some of the facts appear in letters
written by Arthur C. Wheeler of Nor
walk, who was Mr. Hl'l's , political
agent and the treasurer of the com
mittee that raised Hill's campaign
fund. .
'This Mr. Wheeler, as I shall show
you, .was a ready letter -writer. He
wrote letters at the drop of the hat,
and( some of them are interesting and
instructive letters as you shall see.
So the question arises. Who is pay
ing Mr. Hill's campaign funds this
year?-
Well we don't know. But we know
who paid them two -years ago.
Mr. Hill is no Blouoh of a writer,
and one of the first things he did was
to write a beautiful appeal for cash.
Oh, it was a touching document. It
would draw tears from eyes of stone.
It was so very pathetic. -Mr. Hill must
have taken lots of pains with it. He
wasn't counting on it to get tears from
stone, but he did hope it would ex
tract cash from steel. Steel, as every
body knows ,1s .tough and a man has
to be something of an artist to make it
yield the Juices that sustain and re
fresh congressmen like Mr. Hill. ,
So Mr. Hill, his beautiful appeal
for funds nicely printed and in his
hands, sought out James A. Farrell,
who is president of the U. S. Steel
trust, and asks him to do something
for the needy.
Mr. Hill had always been such a
useful man. The country needed him.
Steel needed him. If he was to ar
rive, something must be done. There
were so many things to buy.
' One doesn't know Just what Mr. Hill
did and said; whether he stood hat in
hand, as he asked, whether the butler
let him in, or whether Mr. Farrell met
him at the door. We don't know
whether Mr. Hill made his request
boldly, or whether he preferred it
with timidity; whether his voice trem
bled and tears stood in his eyes, or
whether he preferred his request in
the calm confidence of one who has
earned a reward and ezpects to get it.
But there is a letter from Mr.
Wheeler, which throws some "light
upon this interesting meeting.
It is certain that Mr. Hill expected
Mr. Farrell to give him $500, and also
expected Mr. Farrell to collect money
in the West. The letter will be print
ed, and you can read it.- When you
read it, remember that Mr. Wheeler
was Mr. Hill's political agent, and re
presented Hill in law as well as in
fact.
So Mr Farrell was asked to pay
Mr. Hill's bills two years ago, and was
asked to collect money in the West to
pay them.
"Mr. Donovan paid his own. Some
"In an article in the Outlook on
Sept. 23, 1914, he said:
" 'Very probably nothing we
could have done would have helped
Belgium. We have not the small
est .responsibility for what has be
fallen her. Only the clearest and
most urgent National duty would
ever justify us in deviating from
our rule of neutrality and non-interference.'

LETTER TO FAR R ELL
OF V. S. STEEL TRUST.
Norwalk, Oct. 21.
To Mr. James A. Farrell,
New Tork, N. Y.
Hear Mr. Farrell: I am enclosing
you one of the circular letters
which we have been sending out
and I understood from Mr. Hill
that he had given you some of
them and that you advised him
that you would send a check for
$500 and you would endeavor to
raise some money in the West for
the good of the cause. Our com
mittee will have a meeting on Sat
urday afternoon of this week and
I will appreciate it if I might hear
from you before that time in order
that I can in turn advise the com
mittee exactly what thejr may ex
pect from the financial standpoint.
If convenient for you to write be
fore that time, kindly do so.
Yours very truly,
A. C. W.
" " V.
of you may prefjf Mr. Hill's method.
Maybe you thianc .a public man who
pays his own bills ought to be in an
institute for the feeble-minded If
that's the way you feel, and-that's the
kind of people you are, why you'll
vote for Mr Hill and do your best to
aid Mr. Hill in smiting steel, as
Moses smote the rock until it gushed
forth abundantly
'teut do you blieve that a public
man, who is going to make legisla
tion ought to take campaign funds
and be so grateful for them that he
promises to reciprocate in Igislation?
Mr. Hill did that. too. The proof is
in another .of those interesting but
tenderly worded letters written by
Mr. Wheeler.
"There is a Straw Board associa
tion, composed of manufacturers who
usually are interested in opposing la
bor legislation, and in keeping very
high traiffs ' They helped pay Mr.
Hill's campaign bills . two years ago.
Mr. Wheeler wrote them a letter, say
ing how grateful Mr. Hill was and
saying that Mr. Hill hoped t.o recipro
cate when he came to vote in legisla
tion This letter will also bo printed
and I hope you will all read it.
"Let us make a long story short.
Mr. Hill had the substantial benefit
of a fund of $10,000, dragooned from
all sorts of - manufacturing interest;
from persons who lived within and
from others who lived without his dis
trict. "This fund paid all the cost of his
campaign that is worth talking about.
It paid for his printing, his postern,
his buttons, his canvass' of voters, for
large numbers of men who worked at
the polls and for many other things.
"Sometimes they got it in cash and
sometimes they got it by check.
"They got it, and they used it. They
used more than the entire Democratic
campaign cost in the state in the game
year. They used more than all ten
congressmen running on both tickets
were entitled to spend under the law.
They expended seven times as much as
the Republican candidate in the First
district expended.
"Is it unfair to assume that Mr.Hill
is doing this year; or trying to do, what
he did four wears ago. Are we not
justified in asking . Mr. Hill, who is
paying his campaign bill this year?
"Who is paying this year for the
big posters all over the bill boards?
"Will Mr. Hill tell us?
"Mr. Donovan will pay his own elec
tion expenses. He won't take cash
nor reciprocate in legislation.
"Which man do you prefer? Mr.
Donovan, who obeys the law and plays
fair, or Mr. Hill, who takes what he
can get where he can get it;
"Seventy Republicans voted for the
Adamson bill, the eight hour bill. But
Mr. Hill didn't.
"Did Mr. Hill's notions of reciproc
ity extend to this legislation? Can he
get more money this year than he got
two years ago, because of this legisla
tion? "Who is paying Hill's campaign
bills this year?" . '

GAVE UP PLAN TO
DOUBLE FACTORIES
Stocking Russian Munitions
Plank With Rifle-Making
Machines.
(Special to The Farmer.)
New York, Oct. 21. How Marcellus
Hartley Dodge, head of the Remington
Arms Union Metallic Cartridge Co.,
Inc., of this city, wh large manufac
turing plants at Bridgeport, Conn.,
and Ilion, N. Y., cornered the United
States munition machinery market at
the outset of the European war was
disclosed through enormous sales made
through New York brokers today.
With complete equipment for a fac
tory being established for the manu
facture of rifles In Russia, by that
government, a, large part of the ma
chinery already having been furnished
by Marcellus Hartey Dodge, it is
learned that even,-his American, com
petitors have been compelled by a
shortage of material, labor and gen
eral demand for machinery of all
kinds, to purchase from! him at ad
vances of from 50 to 100 per cent, over
original cost.
In large storehouses at Bridgeport,
Stamford and elsewhere throughout
the country rifle making machinery
estimated! to have cost over $1,250,000
is awaiting further rises in price. It is
estimated that this quantity of ma
chinery already delivered by the mak
era will net more than $2,000,000 clear
profit. There is said to be under pro
ess of manufacture, machinery of far
greater value.
From undisputed sources of informa
tion among machine brokers of New
York it is saidt that when Marcellus
Hartley Dodge began the erection of
the Remington Arms & Ammunition
plant at Bridgeport, the buildings on
which cover 12 acres of ground and
rise five stories, Dodge found greatN
'dafflculty In getting machinery.
The possibility of greater European
orders than had been procured by him
necessitated plans i for doubling the
raotory . Duinoangs and equipment.
Fearing his competitors would freeze
him out of the market, double and
sometimes triple the "number of ma
chines actually needed were ordered.
"Whea the - housing .condition in
Bridgeport became acute and it was
ascertained that the increase in fac
tory could not be made for several
years, a forced sale of the machinery
then being built was considered. Ma
chine shops .throughout the country,
canvassed, for the purpose of ascer
taining the situation, showed that the
price of the standard designs ordered
with adapters for munition purposes
had already advanced between 25 and
75 per cent with the prospect of fur
ther advances. ,
Dodge decided not to sell but to
hold for the top' notch prices. The
big factory of the Handy & Harman
Co., in Bridgeport, having been va
cated, was hired, for storage purposes.
Several thousands of machines were
stored there. Every available place in
the Remington Arms & Ammunition
Co.'s plant was utilized for storage
purposes and other lofts were rented
in Stamford and elsewhere throughout
the country.
The Russian government attempted
to buy machinery in England and
America, but was unable- to get deliv
eries within several years. A special
appeal then is said to have been made
to Dodge, who has released huge quan
tities of the rifle-making machines- at
market prices which are now being
shipped abroad. The quantity sola is
said to be sufficient to equip a factory
equal almost to the big one' a Bridge
Port.1 '
The quantity of machinery purchas
ed in the cornering of the market is
evidenced by an order to one factory
for 600 standard machines at a price
of $1,600 each or an aggregate Of
$960,000 for one order. Dealers in
munition machines say that there is
practically none to be bought in the
Unied States except through Dodge,
whose conracts have precedence with
a continually rising market.
Officials of the Remington Arms &
Ammunition Co. in Bridgeport refused
today to discuss the report other than
to admit that great quantities of ma
chinery were stored here. Its purposes
or destination was not divulged.

EUROPE SEES IN
WILSON CHAMPION
"MAN OF HOUR"
President Wilson,' viewed through
European tfyes, appears as a cham
pion of international righteousness.
says Major Wallace Winchell, a lead
er of the Salvation Army, who has re
cently returned from the" war zone
where he distributed a fund' for the
relief of sufferers.
"To the sojourner in Europe these
days," says Major Winchell, "one of
the most interesting studies is that
of the attitude of the people toward
America and the administration of
President Wilson. Throughout the
appaling crisis which has overwhelm
ed Europe and threatened repeatedly
to disturb the serenity of the rest of
the world, our President has appear
ed not so much for peace at any price,
but ,for righteousness at all hazards.
His ' brave interpretation of interna
tional law has been a model for man
kind and his demonstrations of its
intricacies in undertaking to force
the observance of such have stamped
him pre-eminently as the man of the
hour.
"On several occasions while in
Europe I heard this expression:
'which is the strongest the German
army, the British navy, or the Amer
ican dollar?' Let leaders like Presi
dent Wilson point the answer. If the
example of the United States in deal
ing with the world problem is no
more than a financial showing, our
influence becomes nil. But if at the
end of the war this country reveals a
moral character, strong, buoyant and
free from selfish advantage or hy
pocritical motives, then our flag will
wave higher than ever before in the
eyes of the world."
BENSON
San Francisco, Oct. 20. After com
pleting a transcontinental campaign
tour and feeling out 'public sefctiment
from coast to coast, Allen L. Benson,
Socialist candidate for President, pre
dicts the re-election of President Wil
son. On reaching San Francisco last
week he was interviewed by The Bul
letin, which quotas him as follows:
"The tendencies of the voters of
this country, as I have observed them
in a speaking tour of 40 days, all in
cline toward the re-election of Mr.
Wilson. If Mr. Hughes is permitted
to talk long enough he will do for
Mr. Wilson all that the President
can't do for himself. Mr. Hughes is
trying to get the solid millionaire vote
and I think he will succeed.
"Mr. Hughes was always a handy
man for the Rockefellers. He went
to church with them and taught a
Bible class there. When he became
Governor of New York re vetoed the
two-cent fare bill, which was so bit
terly opposed by the Rockefeller rail
roads, and tried to prevent the rati
fication of the income tax amendment."
GEO FOR SPECTACLE
been the largest ' and most gorgeous
undertaking of this character ever at
tempted in the United States. There
were more than 7,000 actual perform
ers in the several episodes and scenes
which portrayed the college history,
allegorical interludes required the
presence of many hundreds of school
children at the same time upon the
green turf, which is the playing ground
for the football teams, and these chil
dren in costume with hundreds of their
elders gave dances and were in the
groupings which made the scenes of
great beauty.

occasion will be a promenade concert
