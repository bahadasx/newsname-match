COUNCIL TO CURB DANCE HALLS
BANK TRAGEDY FOLLOWED WARMING
HANDS OFF
THE DRY LAW!
The present dry law should be left exactly as it stands.
Vote an emphatic "No" against both Initiative* No. 18
and No. 24.
Let not the sophistry of clever press agents or the incon
sistency of any newspaper spokesman for brewery interests
beguile you with the idea that ANY booze measure can in
crease temperance.
Two years ago the people wisely adopted the prohibition law They voted the
»alocns out of business.
Should cither Initiative No. IS or Initiative No. 24 pas*. the -aloon will return
in a disguised form. It will be the saloon of the hotel and rooming house and din
ing room and cafe
If graft exists now, it ill increase a hundred fold or more If it is difficult in
any degree to enforce the dry law now. it will be a thousand times more difficult
with either Initiative IH or 24 in force.
Both of the-e measure- are the brain products of liquor interest* I.et not any
honeyed words of theirs, their newspaper mouthpieces, or their subsidized advocates,
delude you with the idea that either measure -prang from a de-ire for TF.Ml'l'.R
ANCE.
The present prohibition law i- immeasurably better than any law now proposed
by the liquor interest*. It has proved a genuine blessing to countless households.
It has improved all legitimate business.
It has given food, and -hoes, and clothes to children of the poor whose dads
formerly fell easy prey to "the poor man's club'*—-the -aloon.
Tiiis is fact. Asli any busine-s house. Ask the credit managers of department
stores and other firms. Collections are steadier and better now
Seattle used to spend from $12,000,000 to $15,000,000 a year for liquor

the amount this city used to consume. r i
The temptation of the saloon has been removed Initiative Rills Nos. IH and 24
will bring it back because they remove the difficulty of getting booze
Under the booze bills, booze will fairly be thrust upon the people without check.
Under the present dry law. our youngsters can grow up without even «eeing
booz£ signs or liquor advertisements. Under the booze bill-, booze literature will
again enjov general circtljation.
Shall the state of Wa-hington go backward? "I he dry law has been in exi-tence
onlv nine months. It is true that bootlegger- have dispo-ed <>f considerable l»ooze
here. It i- true there has been more or le.- grafting Hut they have ".Id their l»oo*e
to confirmed drinkers only. They have made no new rc. nnt- to King Mcohol's pa
thetic army. , . ,
It is only a question of time when the grafter* will be caught, the higher-ups
as well as the small fry. When the graft is cut out. the bootlegging will »ea-e.
It is no argument that we should legalize gambling because there are -ome gam
bling resorts, in spite of the law. It is the -ame with every law.
As far as the va«t majority of the people are concerned, the prohibition law.
as it -tands today, has been a perfect godsend Those who want a moderate
amount of liquor 'can get it legally. The necessity for importing it from the outside
afford- a check upon booze consumption which is healthful for the individual as well
as an aid to officials against bootleggers.
It would be a calamity to add new graft and renew old
miseries by the enactment of either Initiative No. 18 or 24.
The booze gang will vote for both of these measures, tho
their newspaper mouthpieces will seek to concentrate on one.
The safe thing to do is to vote "No" against both of them.

Mayor Raps Way
Girls Are Lured
by Proprietors
"Forty-nine" dance halls, below Yesler way, must
be curbed.
Mayor Gill, Chief Beckingham and city council
men agreed on that Saturday.
New legislation, to change the method of licensing
the dance halls so only responsible proprietors operate,
is already on the way.
"And if any of these fellows get girls down there
by misleading advertisements in the papers," said Mayor
Gill, "my advice to the chief is to use strong-arm
methods to stop it."
Chief Beckingham said he sent an officer three days
ago to warn George Ecker to immediately stop his
method of luring girls, as reported in The Star.
"The matter was brought to my attention," the
mayor said, "and I was even in favor of throwing him
in jail."

I'nder the present system, any
body gets a license by planking
down $2& to the comptroller. The
councllmen nevor see hlin. Then
they get a vermit from the chief of
police.

Councilman Harna said that he

from going Into the places, taking
out all boxes and promptly revok

manager.
Councilman Haas declared he fa

Krlckson had "given the matter
much attention."
*i supposed the police could han

present ordinance." he said.
Bolton and Moore both were of
the opinion that It was a matter for
the police.
"The council Is certainly not re
sponsible under the present ordl
nance," Bolton said.
Mayor C.lll said he did not favor
closing the responsible '49 halls, as
long as the uptown balls were per
mitted to run.
"All these managers." Chief Beck
Ingham said, "have agreed to keep
their girls from leaving the place
during the evenings. I wish this
rule applied to all of the places In
town."
Councllmen Hanns and Hesketh
made n personal survey of the sit

Prosecutor l.utidln said Saturday
that he desired to do everything In
his power to work with Chief Beck
Ingham In cleaning up dance halls
below Yesler way.
