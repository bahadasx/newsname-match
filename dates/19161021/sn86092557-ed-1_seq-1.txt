Sutherland Reminds Voters
of Broken Democratic
Pledges in 1912.
i3*
Tbo citizens of Fairmont who brav
ed the raw cold evening and tilled tho
I auditorium of the First Ward schaoi
building lust night at the SutherlandFleming
Republican Rally were amply
repaid for their effort with a most
agreeable surprise. This was the
able and eloquent address of lion. T.
W. Fleming candidate for Congress in
this district.
Mr. Fleming makes no pretensions
toward being an orator and tells his
J' audience tbat he learned the stone
cutters trade when a youth. Vet despite
his lack of youthful training tor
a speaker he attacked his subject last
nigbt and in his clear and convincing
ft manner presented to bis hearers the

. a way as it he had carved liiern into
i granite with tho keen edge of the
chisel he wtolded la his boyhood
days.
This is his first attempt at a speech
in this city nnd many of those present
who had grown up with Mr. Fleming
i' and had Known him all their lives
j' were an:; -ed when they found that
be was i. . orator as well as a clear
beaded business man. Since his nomi
lnatlou in the primaries Mr. Fleming
baa been busily engaged throughout
the district speaking In one place and
; ' r > another nearly every day or night
, W His address last niglit preseuted in
a restrained and dignified manner
tbe claims of the two parties for the
support of the voters and in his treatment
of the opposition Mr. Fleming
was fair and true, making no personal
attack nor belittling in any manner
his opponent Major Kecly.
Mr. Fleming stated that tbe Democratic
party had been given a fair
chance to show what tlioy could do
toward fulfilling the promises made in ,
the 1913 campaign and that President
Wilson and the Democratic Congress
during the pase four years had enacted
ail of the measures they desired.
>? I The failure of these to make Rood any
of the promises tlicy had made was
dearly ahown by htm in hia discussion
of (he Underwood tariff bill,
whleh he characterized as a "free
! " trade hill."
I Finding that this bill was a failure
and having spent the 100 million dollar
surplus in the national treasury
left by l'resldent Taft; Mr. Fleming
explained how the Democrats had
found it necessary to pass the war tax
measures and to create a tariff commission.
He clearly demonstrated
' that the Underwood bill Instead of reducing
the cost of living as had been
promised bad instead Increased n
many fold.
"This war In Europe has proved a
splendid excuse and blessing to the
Democratic party, and if ft had not
occurred the country would now be
tilled with soup houses" said Mr. Fleming.
He reminded the voters present
of the fact that all of the factories
In Fairmont had been closod soon after
the Underwood bill had went Into
effect and before the war had started.
Twenty-seven mines closed In one
day In this region" said he, "and both
the B. ft O. and the C. ft O. railroads
In West Virginia were compelled to
lay off great numbers of their men."

EXTRACTS FflOM AN AUDIT
What M. A. Kendall Found
After Chilton Went Out
of Office.
(Special Dispatch In West Virginian)
CHARLESTON. W. Va.. Oct. 21.?
Times flies and rtcollections become
dim, but ofllcial actions, once recorded,
seldom become entirely obliterated
either from the record books or the
public mind.
Way back in 1897, on November 16.
to be exact, when G. W. Atkinson was
governor, L. Rl. I.aFollette, auditor,
J. Russell Trotter, superintendent of
schools, and Edgar 1'. Rucker, attorney
general, RI. A. Kendall, as state
treasurer and as such a member of
the West Virginia board of public
works, made an official report to that
board.
That report was made by official request,
and covered the gnancial condition
of William E. Chilton, now United
States Senator, who had just retired
as secretary of state, but whoso conduct
of the office of secretary of
state was reputed to have bten such
that an investigation was asked for
and made. Troasurer Kendall having
ben delegated to inako It.
"1 find." says Rlr. Kendall In closing
the fourth paragraph of his report.
and, referring to William E. Chilton.
then retired secretary of state,!
"that his total shortage to date Is $17,
5S0 on license tax on charters."
Part of that total was obtained by
the investigation having disclosed that
Mr. Chilton's report was made on domestic
charters (or which he charged
himself $10, wherein the charters were
Issued to rorcign corporations which <
had paid $50 to the secretary of state.
"When I undertook to investigate i
the accounts for the sale of books and i
tax on state seal. I found a condition i
of things which was very remarkable I
indeed," further says Mr. Kendall's i
report. "Here is an Important branch i
of busienss which Involves thousands a
of dollars during a term In the secretary
of state's office, but I found no i
record of it whatever. If he ever kept I
any he must have carried it away l
with him. The statute pr'scribed that i
the secretary of stale shall make a l
detailed report of these matters twice 1
a year?In January and July?and 1
certify it to the auditor, and assesses
a heavy fie for failure to do so.
"Dut I find that during his entire
term Mr. Chilton made but one report
to the auditor and I do not consider I
that report within the meaning of the '
statute, for he simply makes a bald
statement of the amount received." 1
Mr. Kendall reported that he had 1
no means of vertlfylng reports made
after Mr. Chilton's retirement from office
hut says "I have made a comparison
between the business in these lines
during his administration and the
same as reported for the first eight
months of the present administration
and And that the average per month
during Mr. Chilton's administration for
tax on seals as reported Is 164.34.
The average per month from this same
source as reported by Mr. Dawson Is
$118.37. The average per month during
Mr. Chilton's administration for
the sale of books as reported Is $143.11.
The average per month from the
same source as reported by Mr. Dawson
Is $298.95.
"By adding the amount which he reports
as his shortage on the sale of
books and tax on seals to the amount
of shortage on license tax on charter
1 find the total amount to be $23.(Continued

Lhe most remarkable features of the
times. Each week prices, already at
in extreme position go still higher
ind the advances embrace wide range
of commodities; yet current and forward
purchasing Is unabated and
competitive bidding again accentuates
the strength of many markets. It remains
the exeception where the seller
Beeks the buyer, and some manufacturers
have withdrawn quotations entirely
as a means of checking the influx
of orders which cannot be filled
for months to come, or which they are
not Inclined to accept lest prices
change to their disadvantage.
That the great activity in business
Is country-wide Is evidenced by the optimistic
reports from all sections and
It is noteworthy that the' high level
of farm products is imparting decided
Btlmulus to conditions In the West and
South, where financial obligations are
met with Increased promptness. The
Improvement In collections is reflected
In diminished failures while savings

rising losta of necessities are accumulating

PITTSBURG, Oct. 21.?Railroads la
the Pittsburgh district are facing a

day that for the first time in years an
agent had been sent to Chicago in the
hope of buying coal. Prices are also
advancing but consumers Bay tbey
would be willing to pay if tbey could
get coal.
The shortage is laid to the extraordinary
demand and car shortage, associations
of coal operators reporting
that the output of the mines in the
bituminous district of western Pennsylvala
and eastern Ohio is Berlously
curtailed because of tbeir inability to
get cars. Official reports to. tbe Kanawha

1G0 cars were available where 600
were needed.

(Special Dispatch to West Virginian)
MORGANTOWN. W. Va.. Oct. 21?
rhe Joke of the campaign in West Virginia
for the equal suffrage amendnent
is the begging letter of Colonel
iV. H. Conaway of Fairmont asking for
contributions to a fund with which to
ippose votes for women. In some way
his begging attorney of the West Vir;lnia

in the rigbt of women to the franchise.
His reply to the appeal of the
chief finance commissioner of the Anis
association wsb in part as follows:
"I have seen a little of the campaign
vork of the West Virginia Equal Sruf'rage
Association in my county, and
: am convinced that it is absolutely
ion-partisan, and I am frank to say
hat I favor woman's suffrage, as 1
lave done for the past ten or more
. ears. Not from any argument that I
lave heard for or against it, but sim?ly
because I believe it to be a matter
>r right and Justice, and your letter
>nly Intensifies my convictions; and,
n addition, makes one pause to tbink:
EVhy this great fight against Equal
suffrage? There can be no argument
igainst it. Then, is there some dark

Absence of Harrowing Scene
Familiar With Mine D
Party Causes Sup
c. t ,
After a full crew working all night
long and up until two o'clock this
afternoon trying to get preparations
completed so that the brattice crews
and the mine experts can get Into the
shaft at 11 opening of Jamison No. 7
mine where ten men were killed in an
explosion which shook the country
for miles around Thursday noon, announcement
was made that a crew of
nine picked men would be sent into
the mine soon to get Allison, who is
about 400 feet from the opening, and
to get any other victims which may
bo discovered.
These men will also be expected to
carry the air with them by tearlg
down obstructions and building air
routes as they go along. Following
these men will be a crew of experts
who will venture toward the inner
workings where the air iB still bad
and report their findings. In the second
party will be men from tho United
States Bureau of Mines, state district
inspectors and Jamison mine fire
bosses and foremen.
The work is progressing rapidly at
the 11 exit, the two regular cage bull
wheels having been taken down and
the cages themselves which were turned
to junk were removed to make room
for a man cage which had to be Installed
In place of the two hoisting
cages. This large steel cage was
Bwung Into It's place at 11 o'clock this
morning and men went below to pnt
In the two large guides for the cage
to slide down. This consumed the
hater nart of the rtav tho trnMna
having been in place at two o'clock.
The single fan at opening B, the
smaller opening .has been kept running
since 4 o'clock Thursday afternoon.
When the cage getB working
it will be necessary to build a set
of safety doors or an air lock so tbat
the fan and the cage can work at tha
same time. This can be done without
delaying the entrance into the mine
of the rescue or brattice party.
The party consists of thirteen men,
five of them being helmet men while
the other will not use helmets. Those
comprising the first party are: William
P. Bridges, contractor, formerly
used to be mine foreman at Jamison:
William Hecker, motorman; Ed.
Capet, Jr., fire boss No. 8 Jamison;
Wilbur Hall, night foreman; Frank
Berry, scraper. These men are all
helmet men. Those going without the
Aeadgear are: J. D. Victor, mine foreman;
Bob McKnlght, driver; Pat Durkln.
driver; William Berry, machine
man; Ed. Capet. Sr.. fire boss No. 8;
Mox Quenon. contractor; Frank Iiuet,
Tlmberman.
When it became known that the
party would number 12, there was a
distinct movement In the crowd which
was gathered about Bridge who is to
lead the party. At first there was a
trace of seriousness but it soon died
away when one of the men spoke up
nnJ onM 4- -
nuu duiu, iiiutQcu 10 a iuuny uum*
ber." This soemed to dispel the fear
of tbe men. Just before leaving for
the interior of the mine however, several
were heard to say that they would
make the party consist of 14 men or
12 inasmuch as superstition about mining
towns is very pronounced.
The gang of 13 was ready to enter
tbe mine at 10 o'clock but had to wait
until the men working about the entrance
at B could make ready for
them. While these men were working
on the cage at B. there were forces
of men put to work to tear down the
old demolished roofs, clear away the
smashed doors and windows and make
general repairs to the buildings.
The organization was complete, no
set of men in their respective duties
interfering with the others. Many men
were hired to help with the work of
clarlng up the premises and in putting
the large cage in place.
The lookerson who did not get a
chance to enter the roped oft section
formed an orderly crowd, no officer
having been needed to keep it back
after the first few hours. The officials
from the government and the
state mine bureaus commented on this
and on tbe lack of heart-rending
scenes of mothers and relatives standing
about waiting for tbeir loved ones.
There was not a sign of one In the
crowd who appeared as though he or
she had lost a relative or friend. It
Is possible that If such were in the
crowd they have become reconciled
to their misfortune and bear up bravely
with their friends and companions
In grief.
State Inspector Eorl Henry commented
on the lack of grief stricken.
He has been to every mine explosion
In West Virginia for the past 15 years.
He was at Ecklea not long ago when
127 were killed. He was conspicuous
at Monongah and he states that these
two mines, Eckles and Honongah,
were about the only two that surpassy
