SENDS PROTEST TO UNITED

I Record, Athens Petitions That

I
Athens, Tuesday, Oct. 17 (Vta. Lon?
don, Oct. 18.)?After the demonstra?
tion here against the allies, during
Which a procession of several thou
aand persons marched to the Amer?
ican legation and protested against
the landing of French marines, a del
egotion of six persons called at the
[American legation and presented res
hplutions asking the sympathy and
protection of the United States against
the encroachments of the entente
"powere. v
? The spokesman said in English, in
?resenting the resolution:
"Henry Clay's speech in regard to
ireecC's struggle for liberty, as well
one by Daniel Webster, said the
uggle would have been made mean
less if liberties of Greece had been
ibsequcntly lost."
The American minister, Garrett
mpers, promised to forward the
:ition to Washington.
The potitlon said in part:
"In the name of the people spon
teously assembled before the lega
>n yesterday c\ ening we come to you
a representative of the'great, free,
>ral American people, to register
you and through you to the
iple you so worthily represent the
teat of the Greek people,
'he Greek king has decided to re
neutral because he docs not
it to his Interest to participate

it he has become the victim of

struggle. During the ->ar past
$jrival groups gradually oolished
functions of the Greek state

Ital. We are aware the Amer
Hberty against slavery and therefore
appeal to their powerful influence to
avert tho subjugation of those who de?
sire only to remain free."
There were' about 5,000 persons in
the crowd which marched to the
j .American legation last night carry?
ing huge American and Greek flags.
Recent reports published in Greek
newspapers that an American fleet
of 30 warships was on the way to
Greece inspired the crowd to Insist
I on seing Mr. Droppers. For several
hours fruitless attempts to gain a
hearing at the legation was continued,
with repeated cheers for the United
States, but no one answered the
bell.
Unknown to the crowd the Ameri?
can ^minister and the legation secre?
tary were watching the demonstra?
tion from windows of the American
club directly opposite. A committee
was formed to wait upon Mr. Drop?
pers today and beg him to put the
case of Greece before the American
people.
After the demonstration before the
American legation the crowd march?
ed to the hotel in which are the
offices of the Associated Press and
renewed the demonstration, waving
the American flag and calling on the
representative of the news agency to
Inform the world through the press
as to what was going on in Greece.
The royalist newspaper Nehcmcra
this morning published a half page
editorial addressed to the Associated
Press calling on it to voice "the far
reaching cry being addressed not only
to a defenseless people which is ba
ing forced to leave neutrality under
the whip of violence, but to the whole
universe; a cry of elementary justice
aguinst the unforgettable Iniquities
being commlttesd, to the destruction
of the liberties of the people of
Hellas."
The Nehemora declared that the
Impartial American press was the
only bar before which Greece coui 1
obtain justice and sympathy .
The action of King Constantine
yesterday morning in dismissing all
guards during his address to the
Greek soldiers and in riding alone and

"Mr. Morgenthau has already re?
