Essential That Prestige of United

WAR NOT NECES8ARY
TO PRESERVE POWER
Candidate Cites Crimes in Mex­
ico as Examples, in Thrilling
Speech
Youngstown, Ohio, Oct. 20.—Charles
Evans Hughes, Republican candidate
for president, was greeted by an en­
thusiastic audience at Youngstaown
Thursday evening. The nominee
spoke with fervor and sunk his facts
into the hearts of those in attendance.
He said in part:
"The president of the United States
is the trustee of executive power.
Placed in control of our agencies of
international industries he is the
guardian of the rights of American
citizens. He has no authority to sur­
render thfem, no right to impair
them. Upon his firmness in main­
taining them depends our security
and our peace. When the Democrat­
ic platform four years ago promised
that the constitutional rights of Amer­
ican citizens should protect them on
our borders and go with them
throughout the world, when it prom­
ised full protection for American lives
and property abroad it stated an es­
tablished American principal. "One
of America's greatest jurists, speak­
ing for the supreme court of the Unit­
ed States, said a year ago, another
privilege of a citizen of the United
States is to demand the jpre and pro­
tection of the'Federal government for
his life, liberty and property when on
the high seas or within the jurisdic­
tion of a foreign government."
Administration Fell 'Down
"Now we, told that the adminis­
tration has ^iffted back on this Amer­
ican doctrftj'egl^ull protection. That
is what It's je'$*dUig .apologist finds it's
record in tP riiean.. It is a re­
versal witKou,t authority and in vio­
lence of in'e,.'specific pledge upon
which it was elected. Instead of fol­
lowing its clear line of duty. It en­
gaged in a personal vindictive war
leaving the lives and property of our
citizens to be destroyed.
"This deplorable course lowered in­
ternational prestige when tlio admin­
istration did speak for American
rights the words were not taken seri­
ously, it had made its reputation."
Can Protect Without War
"Fifty unfortunate Americans start­
ed by train from Chihuahua to visit
•he Cusi mines after having received
assurance from Carranzista authori­
ties in the state of Chihuahua that
the country was safe, and that a guard
on the train was not necessary. The
Americans held passports, or safe
conducts issued by authorities of the
of the de facto government, January
10, the train was stopped by Villa
bandits and 18 of the American party
were striped of their clothes and shot
in cold blood, in what is known as
"the Santa Ysabel massacre." "WSth
in a month after this barbarous
slaughter of inoffensive Americans it
was noticeable that Villa was oper­
ating within twenty miles of Cusihur
iachic, and publicly stated that his
purpose was to destroy the American
lives and property. Villa's unhinder­
ed activities culminated in the unpro­
voked and cold blooded attack upon
American soldiers and citizens in the
town of Columbus, on the night of
March 9, the details o£ which do no',
need repetition here in order to re­
fresh your memory with the heinous
ness of the crime.
"An administration imbued with the
spirit of true Americanism would be
incapable of permitting such outrages.
It must bring the blush of shame to
the cheek of every American that ap­
ologizes for the deplorable record in
Mexico should be made after this
fashion."
True American Spirit Essential
"We want peace we want an endur­
ing peace. We cannot have peace if
we have a decadence of American
spirit. We need an administration
that is not comparing those who
fought and preserved our liberty's to
murderers and raping bandits. We
want an administration which will
preserve the honor of the American
name."
MINOT FIRM TO OWN
MONTANA BANK
Minot. N". D., Oct. 20.—Jurgen Ol­
son of the firm of Jurgen Olson &
Co., has returned from Montana,
where he completed arrangements for
the purchase of two banks in that
state along the new line of the Great
Northern between Lewiston and Fair
view. Mr. Olson stated that condi­
tions in that state are good and he in­
tends to own a line of banks there as
well as in this state.

"I Had to Shoot Him," Says Girl
Held by Police, While Father
Lies Near Death Doctors Ob­
serve Her to Decide if She is
Mentally Deficient.
By HONOR FANNING.
Chicago, Oct. 20.—Fern Roberts, 16,
is absent today from Lakeview high
school.
Her father? Dr. Grant J. Roberta, is
at the point of death in Norwegian
Deaconess hospital with two bullet
holes in his body.
If Dr. Roberts dies his schoolgirl
daughter wi'J be probably the young­
est girl ever to face a charge of mur­
der in this country!
"I shot him because I had to shoot,"
she said as I stood beside her cot in
Two hours later police went to the
home of the girl's grandparents, with
whom she lived.
The police were led to the girl's
bedroom, where she lay quietly fn bed.
On entering the house, after shoot­
ing her father,- the girl had gone soft­
ly to her room without disturbing her
grandparents.
Dr. Roberts was formerly a member
of the U. S. medical board in the Pan­
ama canal zone. He is of high pro­
fessional standing in Chicago.
Doctors say the girl may be men­
tally deficient and are observing her.
When I looked into her calm, brown
eyes, noted her pretty soft cheeks and
slender, graceful body, I almost hoped
that what the doctors think may be
true.
It would be too frightful, too wholly
at odds with nature if this gentle-voic
ed, pretty girl cold deliberately under­
take the murder of her father.

The night of the attempted murder,
according to the police, the girl asked
her father to go with her to a movie

were walking along a dark street, she
drew a revolver and fired twice. She
ran and the revolver discharged. She
was wounded in the knee.

Highest Prices Since "Leiter
Corner" Prevail In Broad and
and Active Trading
Chicago. Oct. 20.—Highest prices
since the Civil war, exxcept during
the "Leiter corner," resulted in (lie
wheat market today from a series of
wild rushes to buy and from a tem­
porary scarcity of offers. On (he
bulge, however, profit taking sales
were heavy and there was an unset­
tled close. iFinal |pHices with (De­
cember at $1.6D 1-4 to $1.6!) 1-2, and
May at $1.69 1-8 to $1.69 3-8, ranged
from 58c decline to ?-4c advance, as
compared with yesterday's finish.
Corn gained at 1 1-2 to 2 8-8c, and
oats n-8 to 3-4c. In provisions, the
outcome was unchanged to 40c high­
er.
Urgency to acquire wheat was man­
ifested chiefly in the first half of the
session. One of the main reasons ap­
peared to be that yesterday's export
sales were said to have reached the
huge total of nearly two billion bush­
els.
Many holders seemed to have arriv­
ed at the conclusion in the last half
of the day that the recent big ad­
vances in the value of wheat had per­
haps discounted for the time being
all the known bullish conditions.
Corn futures jumped 5c a bushel at
one time today and the market, for
immediate delivery, reached the not­
ably high level of $1 a bushel for No.
2 Yellow. Oats, although unusually
active, seemed to be swayed altogeth­
er by the course of wheat and corn.

ATTACKS UNFAIR METHOD
OF GRADING STATE GRAIN
The Hon. Lynn J. Frazier address
ed one of the largest, crowds which
ever assembled in Tappan yesterday
in a strong plea for closer co-opera­
tion between the business man and
the farmer and between country and
city. The next governor was the
principal speaker at the dedication of
the new Farmers' Union hall, and the
huge amphitheatre was filled with
people who came from miles around
to hear the .Republican leader.
Frazier dwelt upon the dependence
of the farmer and the merchant upon
one another, showing that when times
are bad on the farm they are bad in
the shop. He devoted some time to
the farmers' complaint against the
method employed in grading grain in
Minneapolis, stating that good North
Dakota No. 1 Hard wheat is mixed
with other grades at the mills, and
that Minnesota is given the credit for
quality. He also mentioned reports
that have shown the resales of more
No. 1 North Dakota hard wheat than
was purchased, indicating a mixing
of grades after their receipt in Min­
nesota.

The Republican state standard

repeated his stand for the Republi­

GIF FORD PINCHOT
Tribune Special Service.
Fargo, N. D., Oct. 20.—President
Wilson was flayed for his attitude to­
ward conservation accused of seeking
to compromise with interests seeking
to grasp resources of the nation,
and charged with refusing to take ac­
tion which would retain to the people
their rights in the public domain, in
an address delivered here tonight by
Gilford Pinchot, who was chief fores­
ter under President Roosevelt and one
of the founders of the national pro
gresslve party.
Sought Compromise.
"President Wilson has gone so far as
to propose to the conservation forces
that they make a compromise with the
opposition forces that are attempting
to grasp the resources of the nation
for their own benefit," declared Pin­
chot, to an audience which filled the
Knights of Columbus hall. Wilson,
Pinchot charged, made such a proposal
in his speech accepting the nomina­
tion for the presidency, when he called
on the conservation forces and private
interests to reach an agreement "for
the advancement of the cause."
Can be no Compromise.
"There can be no agreement or com­
promise so far as 1 am concerned,"
asserted Pinchot. "My fight is for re­
tention to the people of their national
resources."
Giving Water Rights.
Commenting on the progress through
congress of the Shields water power
measure, Pinchot insisted that it was
a question of giving outright valuable
waterpowcr rights. It had the ap

NO LOSSES SUFFERED
BY U. S. TROOPERS
San Antonio, Texas, Oct. 20.—Am­
erican troops and Mexicans clashed
near San Jose in the Big Bend coun­
try yesterday afternoon, according to
a report received by General Funs
ton early tonight from Col. Joseph
Gaston, commander of the district.
The fight lasted for 45 minutes.
No losses were suffered by the Am­
ericans and information is lacking re­
garding the loss among the Mexicans.
Washington Dispatch.
Washington, Oct. 20—The dispatch
made no mention of firing by the Am­
erican troopers and said there was
no casualties on either side. Officials
here were inclined to attach little
significance to the incident, believing
that an irresponsible band had blun­
dered upon the detachment of Amer­
icans and had withdrawn after firing
a few desultory shots. There was
nothing in General Funston's dis­
patch, it was said, to indicate a pro­
longed engagement.
A paraphrase of the dispatch fol­
lows:
"Commanding office of Big Bend
district reports that on the evening
of October 19. 23 men of the Sixth
Cavalry and a Texas squadron of cav­
alry at San Jose, ten miles below
Ruidosa, were fired upon from the
Mexican side by a party of about 30
Mexicans. Some of these Mexicans
crossed to our side, but immediately
withdrew to the Mexican side. There
were no casualties on either side."
Later reports show firing was prob­
ably done by drunken Mexicans.

GREAT Of All
Makes Urgent Plea to Voters to
Stand Firm For Republican
Congress
I
Casselton, X. D., Oct. 20.—Senator
H. J. McCumber spoke in the Port­
land theatre here this evening to ft
crowded house, the Republican com­
mittee taking the house for the night
and admitting only adults. MSn?
from the country and adjacent towns
were present.
Mr. McCumber was in excellent
form and voice, and in eloquent words
told North Dakota farmers of the
necessity of a sound tariff law to suc­
ceed free trade when the war abroad
ceased.
.He was loudly applauded for his rf
marks upon the failures of the Dem­
ocrats in government, for their loss
of surplus in the treasury, and for
their miserable rural credits law.
The senator was most happy in ridl*
culing the plea that Wilson has kept
us out of war, and his narrative o£
what has happened to us in our rela­
tions with Mexico as the result of tlM
present administration's wabbling pol«
icy of interference was listened td
with intense interest.
Mr. McCumber closed with a pleat
for Hughes and the vote for a Repab*
lican congress.
