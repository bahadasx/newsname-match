voters at Sand Bluings. He was ac
companied on tho tour by various
other Republican candidates, his man
ager, S. 10. Wallen, and A. A, Small,
chairman of the county central com
nilttee. The party made the trip In automo
biles and appeared on scheduled time
at every point. On account of the
chilly weather It wis decided to aban
don tho meetings nnd spend the time
in each place by personally calling on
as many voters as could possibly lie
seen In such a abort time. This plan
proved unusually effective and the re
sults of the afternoon's work con
firmed the belief of tho Republican
leaders that Chandler will carry Tulsa
county.

The party arrived at Sklatook at
1 o'clock. Tho were met hy a largo
crowd of prominent citizens, who
gladly took time off from their busi
ness to escort the candidates about t lie

took giving every Republican candi
date a majority this fall.
At Rnerrv. Joe 1 larshberger and
"Hob" Martin, the latter a candidate
for county commissioner, introduced
the candidates to many citizens and
oil field workers. They urged upon
Mr. Small the necessity for holding a
night meeting in Sperry in the near
future and their recommendation will
undoubtedly be acted upon favorably.
In Turlev some real "medicine" was
made and the party spent a busy and
lemiiiu ratlve half hour th're.
At Owasso, heretofore a hi;r Demo

couragement was received. I 'ozena of

other Republican candidates. The

Although the party did not reach
Dawson until 'be sun was going down
they found a splendid crowd awaitltm
tbr'm. Rather than disappoint these
people it was decided to hold a meet
ing In the postoffice building. More
than flftv men and women listened at
n n'ivelv to the speakers. Mr. Chan
dler bricflv outlined the platform on
which ho is running and showed where
Republican principles of government
mean genuine prosperity when tho
war In I'limpo ends. lie was followed
by Olenn Condon, candidate for the

tection of the oil industry from the
"tax ShvlockF" in the legislature wouln
be his 'biggest "Job" when he got to
the legislative halls. C. K. Baldwin,
candidate for county attorney, who
showed surprising strength at every
town visited during tho afternoon,
talked three minutes but said a whole
lot. "If I am elected your county at

AN APPEAL TO THE
CITIZENS OF TULSA
Repealed efforts to secure legiti
mate news from the! police department
have proved unavailing and The
World Is forced tu call on its sub
scribers anil the public at large lo
assist It in obtaining items concerning
robberies, holdups, murders and otiicr
criuies that might be expected to
eonio under the Jurisdiction of the po
lice. Kor some unknown reason the po
lice have consistently, maliciously
and willfully attempted to suppress
news of this kind. Only on laru oc
casions has it been possible to secure
data of this nature from the police
authorities, and then usually alter the
"tip" has been received from other
sources.
Itootlegging raids and arrests of
prostitutes constitutes the sum total of
news" Hint is volimtaiily given out
by the men In cbargo of the depart
ment. Tin y have always been ready,
even anxious, to get items of this na
ture into tho columns of this apr,
but their lips have been sealed on
all other activities.
Appeals to those "higher up" have)
been made so I i-cqiient ly, and always
without relict, that The World Is
forced to call en its friends and the
public generally to assist it in elisseml
nating legitimate news of law viola
tions. I.liiuor seizures may be news,
but they are only a small portion of
tho news that usually emanated from
a police department.
It at any timu you know or hear of
anything of the character referred to
that von believe would tie Interesting
news'to the readers of this paper you
will confer a favor by telephoning it
to the editorial department of The
World.

Brief Facts
for Voters
(Hy OI.KNN CONDON)
Traveling salesmen and others
who may be away from home on
next edeition day will not lose
their vote this year.
A new law. passed by tho recent
extraordinary session o' tho
state le gislature, is now effective.
It gives to every legal voter tho
rii-'ht of suffrage, regardless of
what portion of tho state tic may
be In on election day.
For instance, supposing you are
a registi'red voter In Tulsa county
and on November 7 you happen
to bo in Outhrie, Okla. I'nder
this ne w law you may go to any
poll in (iuthrie. show your regis
tration certificate and demanel a
ballot. For national and state
officers yon will vole tho same
as those who live there. For
county officers, however, you will
vote in the candidates In your
home county. You may do this
by wiitiiu' on the county ballot
given you tin- names of the Til I Ml
county men for whom you eli-siro
to vote. You must write these
names in ink. Your ballot will
be mailed to tho secretary of the
el'ctn board in the county
where you reside and will lie
counted.
Tho passage of this law was
secured largely through tho ef
forts of Secretary of State Lyon,
who was a traveling salesman be
fore being elected to that office.
