TIDE TURNED, SAYS GREY
LONDON, July 16. Heavy re
enforcements rushed to the Ger
man front have failed to check the
British advance, and the allies
early today inaugurated a new
week of the super-offensive by
heavy blows along a wide front.
"The tide has turned in favor of
the allies," is the declaration of Sir
Edward Grey, made following the
reports from General Haig of fresh
successes.
In the continuation of their spir
ited offensive, the forces of Gen
:ral Haig are now threatening the
approaches to Bapaume, one of
he big railroad junctions of north
jrn franco. . The latest advance
lot only straighteqs, out. the allied
line, but leaves the French in a pif'
iition to renew the attack on Pe
ronne. PENETRATE THIRD LINE.
British troops captured the wholo of
Belvlllo wood and penotratod tho Ger
man third lino for tho first time since
the allies' (Treat offensive began. In u
smashing hammer blow north of the
Somme today.
The whole of the Bazentin-le-Potlt
wood, southeast of tho Important Mar-
tlnpulch height also fell Into the hands
of the British, who repulsed two counter-attacks
at this point and captured
among other prisoners tho commander
of a Bavarian regiment with his wholo
staff.
Advancing east of Ovlllcrs, tho British
fought their way to the outskirts of
the village of Pozleres. seven and one
half miles southeast of Bapaume. on
the Albert highway.
Cavalry in Action.
General Hal?. In announcing tneso
and other Important successes, reported
that British mounted cavalry hsn been
In action against the Germans for the
first time since 1014. A sauadron of
dragoon guards engaged and defeated
a FGerman retachment at the de
Katiren wood, where the enemy's third
line was peneratcd In furious fighting.
The news that cavalry has taken part
In the great battle of the Somme
aroused high hopes here. It was taken
to mean that the British advance now
threatens to cause a. breach In the Ger
man lines, before Bapaume that will per
mit cavalry forces to be hurled Into oc
tlon with telling effect In tho rolling
country of Plcardy.
Heavy Fighting Continues
Heavy fighting continues on the whole
Pozleres Guillemont sector of four and
one-half miles, General Haig reported.
"Wo have gained Important successes,
capturing the whole of Belvllle wood
despite strong resistance and repulsing
a counter-attack," said the official state
ment. .... . .,

Aisle Beside Aged Mother.
CHICAGO, July 16,-Serv.cea In the lit
tle church at Lake Forest were almost
disrupted this morning by the unher
alded appearance of Will Orpet, lean
ing upon the arm of his aged mother,
his constant companion during his trial.
The curiosity of the Sunday worship
ers was almost us great as that of the
crowd which gathered outside the Wau
kegan courtroom last night when It be
came known tho Wisconsin University
studont had been acquitted of the mur
der of Marlon Lambert, his high school
sweetheart
Orpet and his mother marched bravely
to n vacant pew near the front of the
church. They were the cynosure of all
eyes. Following them came Edward Or
pet, tho father. In another pew In the
church sat Mr. and Mrs. Frank Lam
bert, parents of Marlon. The families
eat with "eyes straight ahead," care
fully avoiding any recognition.
Early this week Ornet will Journey to
some secluded spot In the pine woods of
Michigan for a live months' vacation In
the hope of exrhni ping his prison pallor
lor a ruddy, heulthy tan.
Will Complete Education.
After he Is rested he plans to com
plete his education. It Is Improbable he
will attempt to re-enter tho University
of Wisconsin, becauso of a hostile feel
ing: existing among the faculty rpembets
there. Although freed of the murder
charge, tho university authorities fel
that Orpet's presence Is unwolcomo be
cause of his confession of relations
with Marian Lambert.

rounded by crabs. Tappas staked Its

of tho ii. P. C. A. said it was a plain
case of cruelty to animals and ordered
tho crustacean released. But Pappas
denied that a lobster ts in animal.
"If 1 remove those ne:ts. there will
not be a ltu crab In the window," ho
said.
President John Grossgebauer, of the

The commission was named several

the merchants asked to be given a trial
under the old basis. Officials reported
that the result was satisfactory and the
commission will be aboUshed with the

Health Officers Say the Addi

Not Denote Epidemic.
Another case of Infantile paralysis
has developed within the last twenty
four hours In the District, making
three cases of the disease reported here
within the past four days, but Health
Department officials today expressed
the belief that there was no appre
hension of an epidemic of the malady.
Every precaution possible has been
taken, according to Dr. XV. C. Fowler,
chief of the division of contagious dis
eases of tho Health Department.
"There Is no greater cause for alarm
now than at the time of the discovery
of the first case," said Dr. Fowler.
Tho third case of the mslailv thr I.

"Manila, 1903."
A sweeping investigation of repeated charges from many sources
that the militiamen now on the Mexican border are being served food
unfit for human consumption has been ordered by Secretary f War
Baker.
Probability of a Congressional investigation similar to the probe
into "Alger beef," in 1898, was accentuated today when Senator La
Follette received a ringing protest from officers in the First Wisconsin
Infantry, who bitterly complained of the quantity and quality of the
food furnished their soldiers.
Other Senators and members of the House have received com
plaints severely arraigning the commissary department, which furnishes
the rations to the militiamen.
SUFFER PTOMAINE POISONING.
The complaints state that scores ofi
citisen-soidiers sre m field hospitals

FOUR MORE SHARKS
N.Y.
At Least Fifty-six Monsters
Sighted in 24 Hours, If Re
ports Are True.
rnsw xuiik, July !. Four more
sharks have been captured in waters
not far from New York in the last
twenty-four hours, and dispatches from
many other points within a radius of
fifty miles tell of the sea monsters hav
ing been seen there.
If all of the reports were authentic
observers remarked no less than two
schools of sharks besides nineteen
others not attached to any particular
moving company.
Estimating a score of sharks to a
school a moderate figure In view of the
fact that dictionaries nro silent on the
composition of a school except to de
fine It as a multitude of sea animals
there must have been a total of flfty
alx of them discovered.
Among the. sharks captured yester
day was one four feet long that was
hooked only fourteen miles from tho
Battery the nearest thus far to Man
hattan that ono of the brutes has
ventured. This blue shark was caught
by Dr. Peter Dressl anT Gus Kretz,
two fishermen of Prince's Bay, Staten
island, wno set out in their forty
foot motorboat yesterday toward the
waters of Matawan In quest of shark.
They baited a heavy hook aad line
with weakflsh and were rewarded four
miles from Keyport, N. J. The shark
weighed 140 pounds.
Paul Tarnow's net caught another
one yesterday near Atlantic High
lands. Tarnow's first prisoner was
about seven feet long; his second was
even longer.
At Lang Branch an eight-foot shark
was caught in a net, and'from Glen
Cove, L, I the killing of a seven
foot shark after a twenty-minute bat
tle was reported by E. W. Jewett, Jr.,
dreds of sharks are schooling through
Long Island Sound. He reported that
the one he killed was In a shoal with
others, and that he circled around
with his boat, threw in his net and
got one entangled In It. The shark
leaped, dived, swam undsr the boat,
and fought with all its might and
main until Jewett maimed it with on
axe.
At Matawan, N. J where a shark
killed Watson Stanley Fisher and Les
ter Rtlllwnll on Wednesday, none of the
monsters was reported to have been
seen yesterday, although searching
parties marched the banks of Matawan
creek all day long, full of the test of
the hunt and mindful of the $100 re
wards. Tho mayor and the council will
pay that amount for eaoh v shark
caught.
But If Matawan could report no ob
servations of sharks, other places could
and did. A partial list of them Is Byram,
Shore, Conn., one shark seen; Stam

Osslnlng. N. Y., six; Larchmont. N. Y.,

THREE ALLIED SHIPS
INGf
French and British Warships
Reported Cruising Off the
Virginia Capes.
NORFOLK. Va., July 16. Apparent,
ly waiting for an opportunity to cap
ture or sink the German submarine
Deutschland, now loading cargo at
Baltimore for a return voyage to Ger
many, at least three British and
French warships are cruising off the
Virginia coast.
The warships have not come nearer
the Virginia Capes than twenty
miles, so far as Is known, and they
have not been seen at all by the Gov
ernment observer nt Cape Henry.
The ships are reported to have come
within ten miles of the Capes at
night, but there Is no way to confirm
this rumor.
When the German cruiser Kron
orlnr Wllhelm cams into Hampton
Roads, two British crulsnrn came five
I or six miles from the Capes, and were
easily visioie rrom the shore.
The presence of two or more Ameri
can torpedo-boat destroyers off the
coast Is probably responsible for the
foreign warships keeping so far
away from the Capes. These destroy
ers, assigned exclusively to the duty
of enforcing the neutrality laws of
the Unltod Rates, will see that the
Deutschland. if she passes out of Vir
ginia waters on the surface ts not
molested until she is beyond the
three-mile limit.
The Deutschland probahlv will go
out of the 'Capes whollv or partly

MEN REFUSE TO ENLIST
War Department Faces Cold
Fact That There Is No
Eagerness to Serve.
The Administration and the War
(Department are seriously consider
ing issuance of a draft order to
raise men to fill the wide ebds in
pe1ern1 'cprvire
rCUCrai bCrVICC.
This statement is made on the
best authority. Recruiting, of the
guard 6rganizations-TBas' gono for
ward so slowly, and the need for
Riling them quickly and getting
' complements under training is
50 great that the draft may become
6
necessary.
Very little detailed information
is obtainable as to the exact situa
tion regarding this possible move.
It is known that some of the mili
tary authorities have been investi
gating the procedure necessary to
raise troops by this method, as was
done in the civil war.
ENLISTMENT FALLS OFF.
At that time an apportionment was
made, in the ratio of population, among
the civil divisions; and the men who
wero required to serve were drawn, rrom
lists of persons available for military
service, by lot.
It Is stated that the guard companies
aro In a condition that is thoroughly
discouraging to the military authorities.
.nllstmentH have been slow, and aro
getting slower, the prospect tor ser
vice along the border or In Mexico floes
not appeal', there has been no entnusi
asm, no eagerness for the adventure.
This is me coiu inci uiuv me
oftlce has been compelled to face.
The prospect of real trouble has
seomed. in the last fortnight, a good
deal less serious than it was -when tho
guard organisations were summoned to
the national colors. Tho Impression has
got abroad that the regiments are Being
recruited up to full strength with the
fiurposo of giving tho ma period of real,
ntenslve training, and rather Inci
dentally holding them In readiness for
any emergency that may arise. This
outlook does not fill the soldiers with
seal nor prospective recruits with ardor.
Mexican Situation Serious.
Yet there is now a firm conviction in
the best Informed military and diplo
mats circles that tho position Is as dan
gerous as It nos ever bocn within the
last four years. The recrudescence of
the mlachlef-maklng power of Pancho
Villa, and the decay of Carranzlsta' au
thority, are giving great worry to men
responsible for this Government's atti
tude. It Is fully recognized that a draft
would be highly unpopular, and might
have serious political consoquences. But
mere is a stionu disposition m go nucmi
and employ It If It shall prove tho only
way to nil up the ranks of the organ
izations now In service.
60,000 More Men Needed.
It Is stated that about 60,000 moro mm
are needed to bring the national guard
organizations to war strength, and tho
urgency wtlh which efforts aro belnt;
pressed Is looked upon as reflecting n
very mucn moro auriuui mum ui uuu.ia
than the public has been permitted to
realize. Without much doubt, this haa
to do with tho. rapid disintegration of
Carranzlsta force and the correspond
ing capacity of Villa and tho other irre
concllables to make trouble.
All reports to the War Department
show an almost complete failure of
militia organizations to recruit their
forces up to necessary strength.
Only a few organizations havo been
able to reach anything approximating
war strength. A great majority of
mllltla organizations have had difficulty
in bringing their numbers up to mini
mum strength.
The failure of the mllltla recruiting
campaign was held to be partly respon
sible for ordors sent by tho Wnr De
partment commanders today holding
mllltla In State camps until fully re
cruited and equipped. The order Is as
follows: , , ,
"Thnan mllltla organizations which
