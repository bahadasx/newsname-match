NIX BROTHERS
PHOENIX. July 15 A careful
search of the river for several m 'es
below the spot where their automo
bile was found has failed t rev--al
ar trace of the b! of the Appel
b 1 1 hers, who are supposed to nave
driven off a cliff near the Tonto dam
1 0. .4k !.
Suspicion! hare been aroused that
the men were not In the machine
when It went Into the river, one theo
ry being that they were murdered
and roboed, another that, for" un
known reasons, they wished to create
the impression that the were killed
This last theory is Bcouted by those
who knew the men. It Is said that
they were doing a prosperous busl
ness and bad no reason for leaving
the country, and, furthermore, that
they could not get away without be
ing seen somewhere. j
The place where the accident oe- (
curred, if it was an accident. Is on a
perfect! straight stretch of road Just
beyond a bad curve. The machine did
not run off the track gradually, as
would be the case of the men had
driven off naturally, but the front
wheels turned almost at right angles
and the car entered the river right
hide up and was so found when the
water was lowered.
It Is also claimed by the searchers
that both bodies would be unlikely
to float or be carried so far as the
search has continued without at least
one of them becoming lodged.

IANI POINT
IN COCHISE
WHISKEY SELL
ING CASES
ATTORNEYS ARGUE BEFORE THE
SUPERIOR COURT TODAY;
OECISION MONDAY
WANT CASES DISMISSED CLAIM-
ING NOT PROPERLY BEFORE
SUPERIOR COURT
The Jur in the case of the State
vs I. Illitzk charged with receiving
stolen goods, after being out but a
bhort while this afternoon returned a
verdict of guilty and the defendant
was reanded to the custody of the
sheriff. Sentence will be rendered
later, and application for bond pend
ing sentence was denied by the court.
Shortly after the noon hour, argu
ments by attorneys for the defendants
in the whlske selling cases which
were to be up for pleading today were
heard, and after numerous authorities
had been cited by both the count at
torney and attorneys for the defend
ants as to whether the Superior Court
has direct jurisdiction in the cases,
th defendants not having been given
preliminary hearings, the court took
the matter under advisement until
Monda when a decision will be given
It is the opinion of the count attor
ney according to the statutes, that a
preliminary In a misdemeanor or whis
ke selling case is not necessary, but
argument of the defending attorneys
is that a preliminary is necessary and
the cases should be dismissed, owing
to the fact that the cases were brought
direct into the Superior Court instead
of having been given a preliminary
hearing The point Is both important
and interesting, and the matter of
whether the some 350 whiskey selling
cates will be prosecuted hinges on the
decision of the court.
