COTTON LINTKKS
ARE TO BE USED
Plant it Located in East Co
lumbus, and Will Soon Be
gin Operation.
Mr. .J. I). Kennedy, formerly of
Memphis, has rented a building in
East Columbus and is to engage in
tie manufacture of gun cotton,
which it is understood is to be sold
both in this country and in Europe.
In the manufacture of the gun cot
ton a high grade of linters is used
and these linters can be secured in
large quantities here, as this city is
situated in the midst of a cotton
ton growing section.
A large lot of modern machinery
has been purchased and has already
begun to arrive. The building se
cured by Mr. Kennedy, which for
merly housed another manufacturing
concern, now presents quite an ani
mated appearance. Laborers are
busy unloading machinery and every
effort U being made to get the plant
in operation at the earliest possible
moment. This is considered quite an
important industry, as it plates Co
lumbus within the ranks of many
cities which are gaining prosperity
through the manufacture of war sup
plier. The planlt will turn out 10,000
pounds of gun cotton per day, and
the chlorine which it is necessary to
use in the bleaching process will be
manufactured here. It will be made
by an electrolysis process and spe
cial machinery will be required for
its i.anufacui "'" " "
One thing that induced Mr. Ken
nedy to locate his plant here was the
high quality of our water. Pure wat
'er forms an important factor in the
manufacture of gun cotton, and he
found here water of the purest qual
ity, a recent analysis having shown
the local supply to be clear, soft and
free from minerals.
CITY WITEB ALL ill,
SMS STATE CHEMIST HAND
ANALYSIS OF SAMPLE SENT BY
MAYOR GUNTER SHOWS
GOOD RESULT.
"So far as the results of the
analysis show, this ought to. be a
very excellent water," says state
Chemist W. F. Hand, of the A. &
M. College, in submitting an analy
sis of a sample of water from the.lo
cal municipality recently sunt him by
Mayor W. C. Gunter.
Typhoid fever has been epidemic
in several southern citites for sever
al weeks past, and as outbreaks of
the malady frequently result from
the drinking of impure water Mayor
Gunter took the precaution to send
the state chemist a sample of our
water for analyzation. Mr. Hand's
letter which is most gratifying, fol
lows: "Hon. W. C. Gunter, Mayor,
" Columbus, Miss.
"Dear Sir:
"Referring to the sample of water
received from you a short time ago,
we take pleasure in reporting as
follows:
"Total solind mater in Solution
39.20 parts per million. Chloride
7.00. Bicarbonic acid 7.32. Car
bonic acid, none. Free amonia,
none. Albuminoid amonia, 0.02.
Nitrite nitrogen, none. Nitrite ni
trogen, trace.
"So far as the results of the anal-
sis show, this ought to be a very ex
cellent water. The amount of solid
matter in solution is very small, it
contains practically no free and al
buminoid amonia and nitrites. All
of these indications are good.
"Assuring you that it is always a
pleasure for us to assist you when
ever we can, I am,
"Very truly yours,
W. F. Hand,

LOCAL GROWERS
Meisrs. Stokes, Weatherly and
Richard ton Attend Meeting
at Cedar Point.
Hon. Walter E. Stokes, of Macon,
president of the Mississippi Hay
Growers Association, and Messrs. J.
V. Richardson, a local hay mer
chant, and J, G. Weatherly, secreta
ry of the Columbus Chamber 'of
Commerce, have returned from 'Ce
dar Point, O., where they went to at
tend the annual meeting of the
National Hay Growers' Association
which was recently held in that city.
The purpose of these gentlemen in
attending the meeting was to make
an effort to have the grades on
Johnson grass changed, and while it
is against the policy of the associa
tion to change any grades that have
once been fixed they succeeded in
securing the establishment of the
following grades on alfalfa and
Johnson grass hay, which it is be
lieved will prove satisfactory to
both producers and dealers in for
age. . Choice alfalfa and Johnson hay
shall be three-quarters alfalfa, of
good color, sound and well baled;
mixed with one-quarter of Johnson
hay of good color.
No. 1 alfalfa and Johnson mixed
hay shall be alfalfa and Johnson hay,
one-half of each; of good color,
sound and well baled.
No. 2 alfalfa and Johnson mixed
hay shall be alfalfa and Johnson
lAi3 .i;m. od enough frNo. !,' wi
shall contain one-fourth alfalfa and
three-fourths" Johnson grass, and
with not more than 10 per cent of
other native grasses; same to be
sound and well baled.
Boat Brings Muscle Shells.
The gasoline boat "James R." ar
rived in Columbus Thursday with a
lond of muscle shells, which will be
.shipped to Iowa to be converted into
buttons. The concern to which they
will be shipped has for some t'me
past had representatives here buy
ing up these shells, and the industry
has grown to be quite an important
one. The boat left on her return trip
Friday, carrying a cargo of miscel
laneous freight to points down the
river. -
TI BIG HtlS WILL
THE DISPATCH AND COLUMBUS
RAILWAY, LIGHT & POWER
CO. TO MOVE.
Two important local concerns,
the Columbus Dispatch and the Co
lumbus Railway, Light and Power
Company will soon move into new
quarters. The Dispatch will move
into the building at No. 413 Main
street, at present occupied by the
Pastime pool room, and the Colum
bus Railway, Light and Power
Company will move into the build
ing vacated by the Dispatch.
Both these buildings are owned
by Hon. P. W. Maer, editor and
proprietor of the Dispatch, and it is
understood that the changes are to
be made because the Columbus
Railway, Light and Power Company
evinced a desire to secure a long
lease on the structure which for the
past eleven years has been used by
Mr. Maer as the home of publica
tion of his newspaper.
It is authoritatively stated that
contracts have already been signed
and that both concerns will move to
their new quarters within the next
thirty days.

CLEVELAND JURIST GETS'
PLACE ON SUPREME
COURT BENCH.
CONGRESS MAY
SOON CONFIRM
President Hopes Favorable
Action Will Be Taken Be
fore Present Session Ends.
Washington, July 15. John lies
sin Clarke, federal district judge at
Cleveland, Ohio, was 'nominated by
President Wilson today as an asso
ciate justice of the supreme court to
fill the vacancy caused by the resig
nation of Charles Evans Hughes to
accept the Republican nomination
for the presidency.
Prompt confirmation of the ap
pointment by the Senate is expected.
The judiciary committee will meet
Monday to consider it. Two years
ago the Senate confirmed the nomin
ation of Mr. Clarke as district judge
after an investigation had disposed
of suggestions that his service as
counsel for railroads might have im
paired his usefulness as a jurist.
The President made his selection
after conferring today with his
cabinet. Up to the last moment the
name of Judge Victor J. Dowling,
of the New York supreme court, was
seriously considered.
Judge Clarke is a Democrat and
for years was identified with pro
gressive movements in Ohio, being
associated with the late Tom John
ion, Newton D. Baker now secretary
of war, and other leaders of the par
ty in his state.
Judge Clarke was appointed dis
trict judge about two years ago by
the President, who therefore was
-tW' KigU.; j'cp'tmi fd with his
qualifications.
The new justice, John Hessin
Clarke, was born at Lisbon, Ohio,
Sept. 18, 1857, graduated at West
ern Reserve University in 1877, was
admitted to the Ohio bar in 1878.
Up to the time of his appointment as
district judge in 1914 he practiced
law in the courts of Ohio. He is a
bachelor. I
He has been a life-long Democrat
and ran against Mark Hanna for
the Senate in 1903. A sketch of his
life given out at the White House,
ays he has been conspicuous in
progressive movements in Uhio and
n the nation at large" and is "prob-
rbly the most gifted orator in Ohio."
Since becoming district judge in
Clevjiund he has taken special in
terest, in the naturalization and Am
eiicanation of foreign born citizens.
The political complexion of the
court is not changed, a majority re
maining Republican.
The President confidently expects
that Judge Clarke will be confirmed
during the present session of Con
gress in order that he may begin the
study of cases pending before the
supreme court before the convening
of the court in the fall.
Dr. Lehmberg Out Again.

NUMEROUS CROPS PRACTI
CALLY RUINED BY RAIN
AND WIND.
MANY FARMERS
ARE MAROONED
Water Filled Many Roadways,
Completely Cutting off Con
nection.
The Tombif baa rier Si stead,
iljr falling, tha waters having
receded to tha ettent of about
twenty-four inches during tha
past day. Tha Luaapalila, how
eer, is reported to ba rising,
and this rise is probably dua to
ilia fact that heavy rains have
fallen in tha aection above Co
lumbus through which the
stream passes. These rains did
not cover tha territory travers
ed by tha Tombigbee, hence
tha stream "was not affected by
them.
Now that the storm which visited
this section last week is over and
farmers are drifting into town, Co
lumbians are beginning to learn the
real extent of the damage, which, it
now seems, is much more severe
than was at first realized. Many of
these farmers were marooned for
several days, and most of those who
visited Columbus Friday and yester
day were forced to cross inundated
areas in skiffs.
Two separate streams practically
form the eastern and western boun
dary limits of Columbus, and the
courses of both are marked by ex
tensive areas of., overflowed land,
the public highways which cross both
the Tombigbee and the Luxapalila
having been eovered with water.
While there has teen some recession
in the waters intermittent showers
which have descended during the
past few days have served i to keep
them in a turbulent stage, and un
less there is a permanent cessation
in these showers greater damage to
both highways and agricultural pro
ducts will undoubtedly ensue.
According to farmers interviewed
by a repiesentative of the Commer
cial, the damage to crops is almost
incalculable. Thousands of cotton
and corn plants have been complete
ly uprooted and either washed or
blown away, and as it is now too
late to make a second planting there
seems no possible way to counteract
the loss.
The fact that Columbus was prac
tically cut off from communication
with outlying rural districts for sev
eral days has served to show to what
extent the people of the cities and
towns are dependent upon farmers
for what they eat and drink. For
several days it was impossible to
make delivery of milk, butter, eggs,
vegetables or any other supplies fur
nished by farmers, and the need for
these commodities was keenly felt,
Hotels and restaurants found it im -
possible to supply the wants of their
customers and housekeepers expe
rienced difficulty in obtaining per
ishable food for their tables.

GUARDSMEN DID NOT
LEAVE I OR MEXICO, AS
EXPECTED.
ORDER HELD oi
TILE NEXT WEEK
Thirty-nine Riflemen Return,
Having Failed to Stand the
Physical Test.
Dispatches .ent out from Jackson
Thursday stated that members of
the Mississippi National (iuard, who
have been bivouacked at Camp Swep
Taylor near that city for several
weeks past, had received an order to
proceed to the Mexican border, and t
would leave Jackson yesterday. The
order, however, was later cancelled
and the troops will remain at the
mobilization camp for at least an
other week.
Thirty-nine young men who ac
companied the Columbus Riflemen
to Jackson returned to Columbus
Thursday, all of them having been
turned down because they could not
stand the requisite physical examin
ation. All these young men are en
joying good general health, and
failed to pass simply because they
possess minor physical defects. They
are all popular here and received a
most cordial welcome.
The soldiers at the camp are now
busily engaged in making permanent
ditches around the tents and in the
company streets, to carry off any
rain water that might accumulate
during storms, and tiling of a per
manent character is being put down
leading from the kitchens to the city
sewers. This is taken as a strong in
dication that the camp here will be
permanent.
The boys at Camp Swep Taylor
who have been anxious to get to
the Mexican frontier, are disappoint
ed that the prospects of their get
ting away immediately has gone a
glimmering. A number of changes were an
nounced at the camp yesterday.
Capt. Heiss, of Meridian, who has
been captain-adjutant, has been up
pointed to succeed Capt. Storm, as
commander of Company H, of
Brookhaven. Capt. Storm was taken
to Memphis a few days ago for
treatment for mental trouble. Capt.
R. A. Ilartlett, of Laurel, has been
given the command of Company M,
of Arkabutla, and Capt. John Shef
field, formerly of Company M, has
been given the command of Compa
ny I, of Columbus, to succeed Capt.
Mullins, who died here a few days
ago. Capt. Howard Scales, of Macon,
has been named adjutant-quartermaster.
Maj. R. W. Montgomery, of
Greenville, has been made a major
in the ordnance department of the
quartermasters' corps. Regimental
Quartermaster Sergeant Green Wag
ner, of Vicksburg, has been promot-
ed to a lieutenancy, and goes with
i Company G, of Hattiesburg, as sec-
ond lieutenant. Color Sergeant Dent,
of Macon, has been appointed regi
mental quartermaster sergeant, and
it is expected the appointment of a
man to be color sergeant will be
forthcoming today or tomorrow.
Capt. Hammond, with a number
of sergeants, corporals and privates,
ordered to camp yesterday, arrived
today, but ho far no announcement
of their assignments has Jieen made.

Promises Made to Incorporate
Many Reforms' in Mexican
Conttitu1 ttn Soon.
,itii Antonio, Texas July 15.- A
plot to iIi-po-e ('iiniinya and eb'vate
(icn. Pablo (ionale to the po-iiioii
of first ibicf, h;is been hatched by
Chi taiK'.a's group of irmt powerful
supporters and will be worked out in
detail at a conference to be held at
Ijueretaro within a few days, accord
ing to information brought to San
Antonio today.
A prominent young .Mexican, who
has made his home here for severa
years, son of one of the greatest
Mexicans of the Diaz regime, re
turned from the City of Mexico, lie
had j;one there immediately after
President Wilson called out
the national guard to otTer his ser
vices to his country. While there he
enjoyed the confidences of mem
bers of Carrana's cabinet and was
informed of the intention to displace
Carranza.
Returning to San Antonio, this
Mexican, who enjoys the high re
gard of both Mexicans anil Ameri
cans, told some of his closest friends
and tonight the plot is being widely
discussed. The man who brought the
news now refuses to admit its au
thenticity, and hft friends ask that
his name be not used on account of
the damage such publicity would do
him in Mexico.
It is said that the Felicitas, the
followers of Felix Diax, will come in
under the new arrangement, but it
is doubted here.
Ubregon, it was generally held,
was to have succeeded Cnrran.a
months ago. The Columbus raid sav
ed Carran.a for a time, and now
Obregon is said to have lost his pow
er to unite various factions, For that
reason Gonzales has been fixed upon
us the strongest man.
Gonzales has been considered fair
to Americans, and he has been loyal
to the Carrunxa cause consistently
lie began bis career as a flower mil
ling employe in the state of Coahil

afterward married the daughter of a

the business.

BARDMENT, London, July 15. After the
briefest preliminary bombardment
which has preceded any important
action on the western front, the
British armies on the Somme have
again swept forward and have cap

second positions. On a front of four
miles the British have advanced to
a depth of a mile and have held all
positions gained in spite of violent

AMIES OF POLICE
OEOREASE 11311 SALES
FEW BLIND TIGERS ARE OPER
ATING HERE, AND GAMBLING
IS ON DECLINE,
There lias been a marked decrease
in the sale of blind tiger liquor in
Columbus during the pust few
months, and this decrease is attribu
table both to the recently enacted
state law limiting shipments and to
the activities of the local police de
partment. Last December the police force
was reorganized, Mr. John Morton
having been taken from the ranks
and placed at its head, and since that
time a vigorous war against the il
licit sale of liquor has been waged.
Many blind tigers have been broken
up, and the police keep a close watch
to see that no new places spring into
existence.
The police are also making things
hot for knights of the green cloth,
and the city is probably freer from
gambling than at any former period
in its history.
