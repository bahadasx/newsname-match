resistance after breaking through the
German second line and were met by
: steady machine gun fire In the dts-
- trtct north of Ingueval.
Notwithstanding this determined
opposition, the British troops continu
ed to solldnte their poaltlons and
"break down small German positions

refugt from Mexico, the" naval cbl-
Uer Nanahan arrived at 6 a. iu. from
La Pas, which port she left July 11.
The passengers, however, have been
on board ship since June SO, trans
ferring from one vessel to another.
There were about 30 men from the
Southern Paelflo railway yarda at Em
Palme, half a dosen employes of the
Richardson Construction company
from Ffeperanxa, In the Yaqul valley,
and a number of miners and ranch
ers. Five women and aome children
were Included In the passenger list
The state of affairs along the low
er coast waa vividly related by to
day's arrivals. All foodstuffs have
been confiscated by the Mexican mili
tary forces, and the civilian popula
tion Is surviving as best It can on
fruit and a meager allowance or
flour.
'In case of a popular uprising, sev
eral of which have been threatened,
every whit person, no matter of
what nationality, would suffer at ths
hands of the wild, half-starved
peons," stated one of the railroad
officials.-
John B. McPherson, United States
consul at Ouaymss, waa among the
refugees, Asked who ordered the
Americans out of Mexico, he stated
that It had been the American gov
ernment.
"The Mexloana urged us to remain,
promising that all was quiet, and
that Pec would be maintained. At
no time were we mistreated, but the
orders of the government were to
leave, and we had to obey," said
MoPherson.
That the present reaction In favor
of Villa will receive the hearty sup
port of the states of Slnaloa, Teplc,
and Sonora was the aseertlon of the
refugees. " - '

Congressman Who Was Thorn
in Flesh of Administration
As Member of House Has
Been Politely Eliminated
Washington: July 15. President
Wilson today nominated Congressman
James Iiay, of Madison, Va., to be
a judge of the United States court
of claims.,.
Congressman Hay, veteran member
of the house, Is chairman of the mili
tary committee, whose much-criUci-
ed federalized bill furnished . the
framework for the present army, re
organization plan. Acceptance of the
position and his retirement from con
gress Is expected to be announced
at once. t
For aeveral months, It lias been
reported In congressional circles, that
tha administration desired a place
for Hay. Many of his policlea have
not agreed with those of the presi
dent." When the army bill was In the
making, Hay, Secretary of War Gar
rison and the president became In
volved in a three-cornered fight over
the, provisions of tha bill. Hay wis a
small army man. Hay demanded that
the militia should be embodied, while
Garrison and the president stood for
a citizen soldiery. Feeling between
Hay and Garrison became very bitter
and when It appeared the president
could not force a volunteer army Idea
through congress, because of Hay's
opposition, Garrison resigned.
Army officers were openly jubilant
over Che appointment, since Hay and
the army general staff always have
been at loggerheads over, the ques
tion of administration of the army.
Hay has been a consistent champion
of the militia.
The appointment of Hay makes
Congressman 8. Hubert Dent, Jr.,
Alabama, ranking member and, prob
able new chairman of the military
committee. Dent Is serving his fourth
term. His championship of the na
tional guard has been decidedly less
emphatic than Hay's'.'
"It's a . good appointment," said
Speaker Clark, 'but a loss to the
house,"
Republican Leader Mann led In a
demonstration today In honor of Con
gressman Hay when he reappeared
on the floor of the house.
"He haa been one of the ablest
members of the house; on of Its
greatest fighters," said Mann. "We,
are sorry to part with him."

strongest military leader In Chihua
hua state. He refused to obey orders
of President Carranza to make cer

down" and will remain loyal. Efforts
to bring, about Trevlno's courtmarttal
tailed, as the army would not oppo"
htm and he threatened to Join with
Villa. General Ignaclo Enrlquez, ap
pointed' by Obregon to replace Trevlno
has been recalled. Enrlquez probably

oned late last night, a radio message

The Hector was abandoned at
12:45 a. m., seven miles northeast
of Cape Romaine. When last seen
she was a total wreck. All who were
aboard, Including G. F. Newell, her
muter, are proceeding to Charleston
aboard the rescue vessels.

Hector first flashed her distress call,
saying she was 14 miles south of
Charleston, with a list of 10 degreea
starboard. Twenty minutes later ah

Believe we are sinking." ," "
The steamer Alamo Immediately
sped to her assistance and was fol
lowed quickly by the tug Vigilant
Captain Hunt of the latter vessel re
ported, however, that he was unable
to get within three miles of the Hec
tor and that static conditions pre
vented her from communicating with
the Alamo by wireless. Just after
the wireless telling that the Hector
was sinking, the collier flashed the
navy yard:
"Crew to leavej- send help,'! and
nothing further was heard until 3:55
when Newell wirelessed:
"Hector aground 10 miles south
east Charleston lightship. Breaking
in two. Rush help."
Ten minutes after the last message,
"send help' at once" was sent, the
Alamo' was standing by. Then the
wireless failed. " ' ' -'
' Immediately after th v Hector's
first call at Charleston, calls from
the Arlington radio station were
heard, asking any vessel to go to the
Hector's assistance. The Hector had
left Port Royal for Santo Domingo,
carrying marine, recruits for the lat
ter place and XJuba." , She attempted
to put Into port here when the storm
disabled her but according to Captain
Hunt, waa unable to get further than
within nine and a half miles of the
Charleston lightship before sinking.
The Hector carried a crew of 12
officers and 60 men and sixty marines.
The Hector w,as built in 1908, one
of the first of the new type of naval
colliers. ' She was S8S.9 feet long,
