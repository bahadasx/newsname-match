Sheds Tears Of Joy For
Boy's Deliverance
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WAUKEEGAN, July 15. Wil
liam Orpet; the University of Wis-,
consin student charged with mur ;. '
dering Marion Lambert, a high
school girl and his former sweet
heart, was found not 'guilty to
night by a jury in Judge Oonnel
ly's court after five hours delib
eration.
The jury retired at 2:30 o'clock
and at 6 o'clock membert were
taken to dinner at a boarding
house where they spent half an
hour.
One hour sfter came the flash that
a verdict had ben reached. Probably
fifty persons ,were still waiting for
it. Orpet, who had taken his evening
meal, was sent for in his cell. Judge
Donnelly, a cripple, who had been
seated in a chair on the court house
lawn chatting with the lawyers, made
his vay painfully upsta'rs on a crutch.
Dramatic Silence.
The defendant as usual was seated
between his mother and Mrs. Edwin
Taylor, his landlady -at .Madison.:
when the lurv filed in. Only one sound
troke the stillness with which for
a few seconds the verdict was re
ceived. It came from a woman about
50 years old dressed in black who had
attended every session of court. She
made an inarticulate sound some
thing between a sob and a shriek. Phe
had never explained her interest in
the case except to sry that she was
"a friend of humanity."
Orpet Speechless.
Orpet was silent through excess of
emotion. He was barely able to re
turn the handclasp of his attorneys,
He accepted the hand or a reporter
tut muttered a scarcely perceptible
"please don't."
Thanks Jury.
He made his way to the jurors and
shook their hands one by one smilling
wanly but saying nothing.
Mrs. Orpet did not lose her sell pos
session for a second. She received the
verdict as if it were a mere matter
of routine. She noted that a photog
rapher was trying to snap a picture of
her son and herself ami warned him,
meanwhile shielding her own face
with a newspaper.
Attorneys Weec.
James H. Wi'.kerson, chief of coun
sel for the defense was unable to keep
back the tears and they trickled from
his eyes, while he, with his assistants,
Ralph H. Potter and Leslie P. Hanna,
were receiving congratulations.
Mr. Wilkerson stated that in his
opinion Orpet had been more than
decided not guilty.
Orpet to Begin Again.
"He was proved innocent," said Mr.
Wilkerson. "He is going home with
his mother now. Then be is going into
the country for a much needed rest
arier the nerve-racking experience
brought on him by a remarkable if not
precedented series of circumstances.
Then he Will come back home and
make a man of himself."
The defendant, his father and
n.other, his brother, Mrs. Taylor and
intimate friends made tbeir way into
the witness room where their privacy
was safeguarded by a bailifr.
Half an hour later they emerged.
"We'll go home now. William," said
Mrs. Orpet, and they msde their way
down the back stairs and to the jail.
Orpet's few belongings which he had
in his cell were already packed.
He had recovered his self posses
sion by this time and thanked Sheriff
Griffin for making his four months'
stay in jail as comfortable as possible
Orpet and his party were taken home
in an automobile by Ler.lie P. Hanna,
his Waukeegan attorney.
Fifteen Figures Often.
The important events of the trial
all occurred on the fifteenth. The se
lection of the jury began May 16;
the taking of testimony was begun
June 15 and acquittal July 15 Three
ballots were taken by the jury. The

New Tariff Issued By State
Surveyor Gives Bisbee
Thousands Of Dollars In!
Fire Insurance
Through the painstaking and thor
oughgoing effort "jf Earuey Norton,
fire chiet of the city of LJii-tee, the
people of the community who carry
fire insurance have been granted a.
decided reduction in their rates which
may mean thousands of dolulrs in the
aggregate during the next few years.
For several years Norton has been
very active in Ka campaign for the
reduction of fire rates in the city of
Bisbee. During that same time he
has made of himself a nuisance, to
the council, in advising and urging
tetter fire protection for the people.
It was through his work and persist
ency that the branch department was
constructed in Upper Tombstone Can
yon and his constant vigilance is re
sponsible, in a large measure, for the
remarkably small loss rat.'j in the
city.
Last October the surveyor for the
state of Arizona, located at Phoenix,
made some substantial reduct.Vms in
the business section of the city. These
saved many hundreds of dollars to
the insured. At that time the sur
veyor, Frank Slaker, promised a more
thoi'jugh survey in the spring which
might net the people of the city larg
er returns.
The surveyor, with an aid, spent
some weeks in the city and district
several months ago. They went over
the entire situation and when they
left inferred that some reduct.'Jns
could be expected. The specific rates
of the Arizona Rating Ollice are now
published and in the hands of the
various fire insurance agents of the
city. They are effective as of May 13.
Under the new tariffs the key for
dwelling h'.iuses is the same as form
erly, viz, 1.12 per hundred dollars of
insurance. The key rate Is that rate
which would apply In case of a per
fectly constructed dwelling, without
any penalties or exposures.
In Bisbee exposures contribute.
m'Jre than anything else, to the high
rate of insurance. A casual glance at
the sides of the hills, which comprise
the residence sections of the city,
wift show the ordinary man the great
danger of fires. The priximity of the
houses tj each other, their construc
tion and their inaccessibility all go
to make up what in any other corn

BALTIMORE, July lo. The load
ing of the cargo for the return trip of
the German submarine merchantman
Deutschland, was suspended late this
afternoon and although a permit was
obtained for work tomorrow, it was
undecided tonight whether it would
be aboard or not.
A second gang of stevedoers was
put to work today loading the rubber
that is to be carried to Germany. It
originally was intended to f'lip this
commodity in the bags in which it
had been packed, but it was found
this would take up too much space.
The removal of the rubber from the
bags consequently will cause an un
expected Ienthening of the time forj
loading and it is considered improba-'
ble that the Deutschland could -get a
way with a full cargo before Monday
night. No nickel so far has been
loaded on the submarine while appar
ently less than 50 tons of rubber have
been put in the hold.
