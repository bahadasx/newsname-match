London, July 15. Correspondents of
London newspapers and the Associat

ish army at the front in the Somme
fighting tell of the apparent inability
of the Germans to check the British
drive. Although the Teutons appear

counter attacks, they were unable to
stop the British troops and in fighting
at close quarters the Germans surren
dered freely. .

WEATHER FORECAST

SHALL GITY
ISSUE BONDS
AT THIS TIME?
EMERGENCIES ARISE THAT
MUST BE MET. CITY WITHOUT
FUNDS, MUST VOTE BONDS IF
WORK IS TO CONTINUE.
Commenting upon a recent action
of the board of city commissioners
in calling an election for the pur
pose of voting the' bond issue July
31, acting mayor London stated yes
terday morning his views upon the
matter in part as follows:
"Speaking from a personal standpoint-only,
I like a number of tax
payers both great and small would
be only too glad to avoid any stop
that would tend to make the burden
of taxpaying.any higher than it is
now. Already many of us think our
taxes are about as high as we are
able to bear, and any effort 'to in
crease them is liable to be looked up
on unfavorably by the average citi
zen. "But in this case the call for the
bond issue is the logical result
of an emergency brought about by
conditions that none of us can easily
control. The unprecedented growth
and prosperity of the city has
brought on a need for enlarging
facilities for meeting the actual de
mands' of the people. People are de
manding water and sewer extensions
to which the city naa promised to
provide. Much of the water and
sewer equipment, once adequate have
become insufficient and unsatisfac
tory because the city has outgrown
their capacity.
In order to take care of these press
ing demands the city is compelled to
have material and equipment and
have the work done, this will have
to be paid for by the taxpayers, the
the logical and business way is to
issue honds payable within twenty
five years bearing five per cent, in
terest as stated in the call.
"An outline of these present de
mands and proposed improvements
may be seen by any one so that any
taxpayer may see for himself just
where it is proposed to spend the
money that may be raised by the
bond issue. I earnestly hope that
before any one makes up his mind on
this proposition he will look carefully
into the situation and be governed
accordingly."

CANDIDATE FOR STATE SENATE
WILL DEVOTE HIS FULL TIME
TO THE INTERESTS OF THE
PEOPLE.
Perhaps one of the best known men
of the state and of the southwest U
now a candidate for the. state senate
from his senatorial district and is
making a most vigorous campaign
now that he is In the race.
Reference Is made to the candidacy
of Mr. J. S. Mullen, who decided that
there was work for him to do in the
lawmaking body of the state and after
persistent persuasion upon the part
of liis friends, consented to make
the race for the state senate.
Mr. Mullen, matured in years and
business experience, is one of the
substantial business men of the state
and for that reason is vitally Inter
ested in laws affecting the Ute at
large. His friends believe that he
is ably eoulpped to render such re
lief as Is necessary at this time and
to give the people of this district and
state valuable service,
Mr. Mullen, like many others In the
stale, believes that there should be
fewer laws and better laws, the stat
ute books at the present time are en
cumbered with a lot of useless laws
and freak passages that they are look
ed upon as a joke by many of the
older states. These conditions he
would remedy, pass such laws as are
actually necessary and which would
be enforced and leave all freak meas
ures out of the statute books. lie Is
especially in favor of low taxes.
Mr. Mullen is a man of recognized
ability and if ho Is chosen to the
office to which he aspires will render
the people efficient service. Mr. Mul
len is making a. most vigorous cam
paign and every voter and citizen
In the district will have an oppor
tunity if possible of knowing him
personally before the date set for the
primary election, August first.
He assures the people, if elected,
that he Is so adjusting his business
so as to give the constitutional CO
days every two years to the duties of
the office.
