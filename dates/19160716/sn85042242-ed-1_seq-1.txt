General Funston, who knows
personally many of the officers of
the officers of the regiment, and
who fought beside it in the Phil
Ippines, telegraphed yesterday to
Capt. Stacy asking the condition
of the troops. The federal officer
replied that ihey were in extra

only waitifig for the engines and
the order "to move.
Two more baggage cars were

No Disease.
!Tw disease like typhoid, due to
unsanitary conditions, have develop­
ed a single case. The only sickness
has] been that caused by the innocula
tion against smallpox or typhoid.
Major T. C. Patterson of Lisbon,
head of the hospital corps, is in di­
rect charge. Dr. T. M. MacLachan of
Bismarck is the sanitary officer. Dr.
Neal' McLean, Kenmare, is also with
the hospital corps. There are 24
men in the hospital corps.
Burn Garbage.
All garbage and all refuse is burn

No horses are allowed inside the
picket lines. No man is permitted to
throw any water anywhere in the
camp and no one may take food into
his tent. Flies do not find anything
to feed upon and the camp is there­
fore not a popular place for them.
Mosquitoes Bother.
Mosquitoes, however, are quite a
pefit. This was especailly true Satur­
day morning, 'because the shower
dro'Ve them into the tents. The hos­
pital quarters are now equipped with
cota and mosquito bars covered with
netting. The other cots are packed
ready for transportation to the border
and when the regiment arrives there
every man will have an outfit like the
hospital has now.
Gov. Hanna yesterday delivered
1600 to Dr. Patterson for the use ot
the hospital.
No Swimming.
Orders not to perimt the boys,
just vaccinated, to swim were is­
sued yesterday because some «f
those who enjoyed the cool waters
of Apple creek Friday evening found
the next morning that it had aggrav­
ated the vaccination wounds.
The men do not have time to think
up schemes of how to keep cool. They
are kept out in the field for eight
hours a day in active maneuvers and
they get the benefit of the full sun.
In the evening B. V. D.'s and trous­
ers have become quite popular, and
stocking feet to rest tired lower ex­

Band Hard Hit.
Physical re-examinations hit the
band pretty hard, much to the regret
of all in the regiment. The daily
band concerts had become one of the
features of the camp. They are still
continued, but with 12 men missing.
Attempts are being made, however, to
recruit it up to its full complement of
28.
Ten per cent of each company are
given passes daily to come to Bis­
marck.
No orders have been received at
the camp regarding entrainment, but,
as it has been for the last week,
everything is ready.

ORPET FOUND
Waukegan, 111., July 15.—William
Orpet, university student, charged
with murdering Marion Lambert,
high school girl and his former sweet­
heart, was found not guilty by a jury
in Judge Donnelly's court, after five
hours' deliberation.
The jury retired at 2:50 p. 111. 'At
6 o'clock its members were taken to
dinner at a boarding house, where
they spent half an hour.
One hour later came the flash that
a verdict had been reached. Prob­
acy fifty persons were still waiting
for it. Orpet, who had taken his eve­
ning meal, was sent for in his cell.
Judge Connelly, a cripple, who had
been seated in a chair on the court
house lawn chatting with the lawyers,
made his way painfully up stairs on
a crutch.
Three ballots were taken. The first
two stood eleven to one for acquittal.
Formane O'Shea stated that by agree­
ment of the juror,s the name of the
obdurate member would not be made
public.
There was a dramatic scene in the
court as the boy student was restored
to his family. His mother and father
have been at his side constantly sincc
the trial began.
The case of Marion Lambert and
•William H. Orpet in the course of its
development became one of the most
perplexing in the annals of criminal
history. Motive paralleled motive, ac­

SENATE IMS ACTUM
Washington, July 15.—Considera­

program was postponed in the senate
again today.
It will be taken up Monday. Sen­
ator Korah forced out a provision to
permit the president in time of war
or when war is imminent to compel
firms, manufacturers or individuals
to produce such material as the coun­
try may need.
Charges that attempts wove being
made to inject politics into the line
of the navy were made by Senator
Weeks during an unsuccessful fight
against a provision to permU the sec­
retary to designate annualiv SO civil­
ians for ten years to positions in the
engineering departments of the navv,
with the rank of ensign. Senator Nel­
son protested against the charge
made.

In the end the guilt or innocence of
the defendant, so far as the adduction
of actual fact was concerned, went
to the jury on the mystifying niceties
of chemical analysis and Orpet's own
compromising conduct. The mystery
attracted unusual interest in all parts
of the United States and Canada.
Trial of the case including selec­
tion of a jury occupied the better
part of two months. There appeared
in evidence forty-four letters' written

a year bottles and boxes containing

COUNTY COMMISSIONER
Word has been received here of the
death of Mrs. Nina B. Emmous, wife
of James A. 'Emmons, July 7, at. her
country home, "Wildflower," Pawnee
county, Oklahoma.
Mrs. Emmons was a former resi­
dent of Bismarck, and was the first
bride to enter ithe city. When Mr.
Emmons and hii bride landed here it
was then known as Missouri River
Crossing. That] was in 1872. Later
the name was dhnnged to Edwinton.
Was 64 Years Old.
She was in lief G4tli year, and had
been in poor health and confined to
her bed for the last four years.
During her resi^ .ice in the Capital

friends and was noted for her chari­
table works. She will we remember­
ed by many of the old timers. Mr.
Emmons was the first, county com­
missioner of the city and was also
editor of the Bismarck Sun, a paper
published in the early days.
Came By Steamer.
Mrs. Emmons was born in Philadel­
phia, April in, 1852. Her mother dy­
ing when she was a child, a relative
became her foster parent and with
two other children took passage
on the San Francisco Tor California.
It was wrecked off Charleston, drift­
ing seven days in mid-ocean, mnny
being drowned. Her foster mother
was given an appointment bv Jeffer­
son Davis, then secretary of war, with
the army of General Harney, which
came up the Missouri by steamboat.
They located in Sioux City, where
Mrs. Emmons grew to womanhood.
She later resided in Yankton, S. D.,
where she was married to Mr. Em­
mons, Sept. 18, 1S72. They came by
steamer to Bismarck, where they re­
sided for 12 years.
Lahr, Overland Dealers, Order
Twice as Many Cars as G.
Forks or Fargo.
CONTRACTS FOR 2,000
CARS FOR THIS YEAR
W. E. Lahr of the Lahr Motor Sales
company returned recently from To­
ledo, O., where he entered into a con­
tract with the Willys-Overland com­
pany to take and pay for 2,000 Over­
land cars during the next 12 months.
This means that Mr. Lahr expects to
sell nearly $2,000,000 worth of Over­
land cars during the coming year. It
is the largest contract ?n the state,
if not the largest west of the Twin
Cities. Fargo and Grand Forks each
have contracts only about one-half as
large as the Lahr Motor Sales com­
pany has just signed, which goes to
show that Bismarck heads the list
as a distributing point.
In 1912 Mr. Lahr had a 10-car Over­
land contract 1913, a 50-car con­
tract 1914, a 200-car contract 1015,
a 500-car contract 1916, 1,150-car con­
tract, and now a 2,000-car contract.
The Lahr Motor Sales company is
a strictly Overland organization, a
large branch being established at
Miles City, Mont.

St. Paul, July 15.—With confidence
that they will outrank the' Socialists
and swing into line in November as
the third political party of the coun
try, representatives of *he Progres
sive element of the Prohibition or­
ganization, who arrived in St. Paul
today for next week's national con­
vention and counted their plans for
a $1,000,000 campaign, which they ex­
pect. to net their ticket no less than
1,000,000 votes.
Dr. D. Leigh Colvin of New York,
president of the Intercollegiate Prohi­
bition association, and one of the lead­
ers in the Progressive element of the
party, declared the coming campaign
would mark an epoch in the history
of the prohibition movement lii lAmer
ica, establishing the party aW at men­
ace to the permanency of bith the Re­
publican and Democratic organiza­
tions.
Women Will increase Vote
Dr. Colvin said the prinicpal fact­
ors in increasing the vote will be the
support of women in states where
they: have the ballot, and the- new
strength the party will receive by ac­
cessions from the broken ranks of
the Progressive party.
C. E. Pitts, secretary of the nation­
al committee, said a million dollar
campaign will be one of the big fact­
ors of the Prohibitionist's gain.
Among those considered! probable
candidates for the presidential nomi­
nation, and who but recently joined
the party, are J. Frank Hanley, In­
diana Eugene N. Foss, Massachusets,
and William Sulzer of New York,—
three former governors.
In a mail straw vote of convention
delegates just, completed by the na­
tional committee, Mr. Hanley is
ahead, it is understood, with Mr. Sul­
zer a clo.se second and Mr. Foss third.

Minneapolis, Minn., July 15.—At the
hame hour today Dan Patch, the
world's fastest pacer, and M. W. Sav­
age, his devoted owner, were laid to
rest.
Mr. Savage was burled in Lakewood
Cemetery, Minneapolis, and Dan Patch
on the banks of the Minesota river
near his milionaire owner's beautiful
summer home.
The famous horse died Tuesday.
Mr. Savage at the time was in a
hospital resting easily after a minor
operation. Word was brought tc him
of Dan's death. The physiciaus no­
ticed at once that it had affected him
greatly. He made the plans for the
funeral of his equine fr'end and at
6 P. M. was suddenly attacked with
heart failure and died in a few mo­
ments.
Never has the career of a champion
horse been so closely linked with that
of his master as was that of Dan
Patch. Never, probably, were two
such friends found who had more
characteristics in common.

The maximum temperature
yesterday was 89 2 cegrees be­
low Friday's. The humidity,
however, caused more discom­
fort.
Mrs. Hays of South Third street
narrowly escaped death yesterday
morning, when her home was hit by
lightning.
The bolt struck the southwest cor­
ner of the house and shot down with­
in eight feet of the bed In which she
was sleeping.
Fire Breaks Out.
The house caught fire and when
Mrs. Hays went to the 'phone to call
the fire department she found that
it was out of order, a tree having
fallen over the wire.
She aroused her neighbors and they
succeeded in putting out the blaze
without the aid of the department.
Damage Not General.
W. E. Reeves, manager of the
North Dakota Independent Telephone
company, declares that the lightning
and wind did not do nearly as much
damage as last Sunday's storm.
One tent was blown flown at Camp
Lincoln, but no other damage was
done.
At Same Hour Dan Patch
and Owner Laid to Rest
breath these people spoke of the gen­
tleness and seemingly human kindness
of the great pacer.
Dan and his master, said these
friends, had the keenest sence of pub­
lic approval and strove always to at­
tain it. Keepers, veterinarians and
persons who have attended his races
and exhibitions told how Dan would
stand and look proudly at the crowds
before staritng a race, and how, when
the race was won, he would trot for
ard to the grand stand and hold up
his head archly until the applause had
died away.
Dan Knew His Friends
Dan was a horse of near-human-in­
telligence, it was pointed out. No ani­
mal knew his friends better, no horse
had a better knowledge of what was
going on.
Dan loved a race, but he didn't care
about the exhibitions that came when
all competitors had been outclassed.
Often, so the trainers said, he would
have to be scored a half dozen times
before he would consent to pace in ex­
hibition. He would shake his head
crossly then, as if submitting to the
inevitable, would at last change the
shake to a nod and tug at the thin
traces.

being "most severe." The Germans
claim the attack has been ptemmetQ,
but say fighting continues.
In addition to pushing back the Ger­
man lines, the British have: captured
2,000 more prisoners. The Geraiuut
resistance has been stubborn but lttie
British have been able to retain tlii
positions attained.
On the Russian front, the most. In*
