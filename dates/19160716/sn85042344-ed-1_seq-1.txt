F'KT S1LU okla., July 15. Okla
honia'H first regiment leaves this
station Monday morning for "some
where In Texas." No one but a few of
the higher offices know the station,
but it will not be Mar fa. That is cer
tain. Mecuuse of the loose way In
whirh the Marfa secret wus handled,
some of the petty officers going to
the extent of newspaper Interviews,
tt was decided to keep the secret this
time. The government does not want
any spikes pulled from the tracks to
permit the. ditching of the Oklahoma
Infantry. 1'ncle Sam wunts to pro
tect till his so'dlers, and train wrecks
ir.eiin perfect ensc n killing and In
juring troops. Another reason is that
the story of the disposition of troops
also apprises the Mexican raiders of
the weak places on the border. -
1 was with Colonel Hoffman in the
Midland hotel when he and Captain
Tohln got the word over the long
distance that Monday morning early
should see us on the way. The rail
roads will begin to shunt more cars
onto the tracks tonight and tomor
row, and ther; will be a great deal of
packing tomorrow. There were al
ready six coaches and two express
cars on the switches at noon today. It
will take many moYe than already
here, for the purpose Is to have "the
troops go in comfort all the way If it
Is possible. The cooks will do their
em king in the baggage cars and of
ficers and rutin will eat their fare on
the seats.
The officers will probably ' hav
standard Pullmans and the purpose
Is to secure tourist sleepers for the
men. Hut there Is doubt about suc
cess In the latter. We will move lt
such a short time that opportunity
will hardly be given to collect tour
ist sleepers diffident for the pur
pose. Hut there will be food and
coo) drinks for all men and then
.will be an arrival on the border in
fine physical shape. The train may
halt two or three times on the way
to give the men a chance to get oui,
and exercise.
Make Appointments,
One of the gratifying things was
the appointment of James It. Culllson,
jr , us econd lieutenant of the
chine gun company. He has spent
time and his own money to go from
place to place and secure recruits.
William K. Green of .Muskogee and
F.llis Stephenson of Oklahoma City
are the new majors, succeeding MaJ.
Winficld Scott and MaJ Charles Rar
rett They have not been assigned
to battalions yet.
Sergt.-MaJ. Kminet C. Choate has
been promoted to a second lieuten
ancy of the machine gun company.
Second Lieut. Milton F. Tnulliee Ol
I)i!venport has been made first lieu
tenant of the machine gun company.
He saw service in the Philippines.
Hergt Kugene 11. Thompson of Troou
J5, envuiry, nas been transferred u
the Infantry and is a second lieutenant
of the machine gun company.
The engineers corps will remati.
here for several days to do certain
work desired by Colonel Ulatohford,
the commandant of the post.
The infirmary company and the
field hospital corps will be at the
same station as the First Infantry.
The two troops of cavalry will go to
another post, less than fifty miles
i.-om our new station.

IULSA SEES UNCLE
SAM AS LIFE SAVER
Crowds Throng to Katy De
pot to View Striking Ex
hibits on Special.
ATTENDANCE IS 5,742
Displays Greatest Educa
tional Force Ever Seen
in Tulsa.
FIVB THOt RAND seven . hundred
and twenty-four Tulwins saw
Cncle Sam in his role of protector of
lives and property yesterday through
a visit to tho government Safety First
train which was on the Katy tracks.
The crowds taxed the capacity of the
train for the entire eurht hours that it
Iw.ls ojh'11 and hundreds were turned
away arter the closing hour of
o'clock.
The exhibition was one of tho most
striking educational features ever
known to this city and represented
a miniature world's exposition on
wheels. It was not. only a display of
equipment UHed by the government for
the saving of lives and property on
land nnd sea but also was so man
aged that when a person emerges
from tho end of the 1,1 cars he un
derstood the system and working of
the massive organization.
The train opened at 1 o'clock In
the afternoon. When tho doors were
first thrown open more than a hun
dred people wore waiting to enter.
As tho day progressed and fame of
the train spread over the city the de
mand for admittanco increased. At
ntglU. the crowd almost overwhelmed
the perfect system in order on the
train.
Fully two thousand Tulsans who
arrived too late to gain admittance to
the train were compensated for their
trouble by an hour's program with a
moving picture machine. A tempor
ary screen and machine was fitted up
on the east, side of the Katy passen
itr depot and a great throng saw sev
eral reels of educational features.
Scenes of country and life over the
entire I'nitcd States were thrown upon
the screen.
The special train consisted of thir
teen all-steel cars of the Baltimore
& Ohio railroad. Four of them were
living- cars for the thirty-five govern
ment officials who accompanied tho
train. Each car was fitted out by
some department of the United
States and had an active member of
that department in charge to ex
plain all apparatus and the routine
of the department in using the
equipment.
"Keep Moving."
On every car was a phonograph
which was used to keep the peoplo
moving. Those In charge of the train
said that nothing was so successful
In allaying congested cars as to start
a lively march on the phonograph.
One of the striking features of
every car In the train were the hun
dreds of large hand-colored photo
graphs and paintings. Every depart
ment showed Its actual work. Its
larger equipment. Its forces, its lati
tude, tasks and results by means of
beautiful hand-colored photographs.
Most of these were mounted on a
composition of celluloid and were
placed in the windows. The light
shining through the water colors,
bringing into relief the resources of
the government, formed an exhibit
well worth seeing If there hid boen
nothing else on the train.
First Three Cars,
The department of the Interior had
charge of the first three cars, in
the first the national parks of the
United states and the reclamation
service held sway. The reclamation
service Is one of the most active di
visions of the department of the in
terior, having as Its duty the salvage
of arid lands and the transformation
of deserts into rich agricultural re
gions. A complete model of a farm
was the feature of this car. W. L
Swantnn was In charge.
In the second car the bureau of
mines exhibited the rucently-djevel-CONT1NUED

NAVAL MEASURE
COMES UP MONDAY
Senator Borah Kills Provi
sion Giving President
War Power.
WASHINGTON, July 15. Consid
eration of the enlarged naval
building program was postponed In
the senate again today but will be
taken up Monday.
Senator Borah forced out a pro
vision to permit the president in time
of war or when war is imminent to
compel firms, manufacturers or Indi
viduals to produce such materials as
the country may need. Vice-President
Marshall sustained his point of ordor
that It was general legislation in an
appropriation bill.
Charges that attempt were being
made to inject politics into the line of
the navy were made by Senator
Weeks during an unsuccessful fight
against a provision to permit the sec
retary to designate annually thirty
civilians for ten years to positions in
the engineering departments of the
navy with the rank of ensigns.
"We have had poiitics in the army
but never In the navy," he declared.
Senator Nelson protested against
the charge. .
"Politics is not the objection to this
amendment," he said. "It is tho old
excluslveness of the graduates of the
naval academy showing they want
none except graduates of the naval
academy to come into the nsvy."
Only four or five senators voted
with Senator Weeks against the
amendment.
Milk and Ice Fund for Babies
"This heat Is causing untold suffering among the poorer families
of the. city and were It not for our milk and Ice fund many babies
would undoubtedly die," said Humane Agent Welch yesterday.
For the first day since the fund was started no contributions
were received Saturday. A total of $500 is needed and needed badly.
With this sum on hand, every noor family and every poor baby in
the city can be supplied with milk and Ice during the balance of the
iummer. In addition to the humanitarian feature of this work sight
must not be lost of the protection to the city as a whulo by the pre

Four Half-Starved Children
Are Taken Care of by
Humane Society.
Half starved, ragged and grimy
with dirt, four little children walked
into the office of Humane Agent
A. M. Welch yesterday and said thoir
papa had told them to come there,
as ho was no longer able to care for
tnein, The children, the eldest a girl
of i and the youngest a tow-headed
baby boy aged 5, were taken In
charge and sent to the Detention
home, where they will be cared for
until some kind-iicarted persons de
sire to adopt them.
Huiiiaiio Agent Welch listened to
the pitiful story of the children while
tears welled down his checks. "I've
been identified with the work of help
ing tlic poor anil afflicted for a good
many years."' he said, "but never have
I heard of a more pathetic story. It
Is the saddest that has ever come to
the attention of the society."
Accompanied bv his wife and four
children, George W. Adams left
Louisiana Inst August, traveling over
land, and arrived in Tulsa during the
fall, but not until adversity and ueatn
had laid hands on tho family and
taken the mother.
Appealed for Aid.
Arriving In Tulsa they went to tho
Humane socioty and were furnished
with a tent. When winter began it
was too cold to livo longer in tho
tent, and tho father with his little
ones were sent to Keystone where
they lived with an aunt until she re
moved to a point in Indiana when
they returned to livo in West Tulsa
with a son who is married.
Adams, who says ho Is seventy
years old and In poor health. Is un
able to work and when the burden
became too much for his son to care
for all of them ho gave up trying
and tho distracted father sent the
children to Humane Agent Welch.
Despite their ragged clothes,
tousled hair and all too plain evi
dence of a lack of wholesome food,
they were sitting In the office of tho
society gathered about Mr. Welch
with smiling faces when a reporter
for The World found them playing
contentedly with alarm clocks and
other articles.
Judges, clerks and employes visited
the office and left -small pieces of
change and the ragged little urchins
fairly beamed their thanks. They
were petted and pampered and no
one would ever have guessed what
they had gone through.
Orders were left at tho Detention
home to have the bath water nice
and hot and the tousled hair will be
shingled and given a chance to grow
straight.
Three other children were received
Into the home from parents unable
to care for them longer.

prominent business man, died at the
Tulsa hospital shortly after S o'clock
Saturday morning, his death coming
as another chapter In the tragedy
which occurred in his office about
noon the same day when William II.
Traylor. former secretary and treas
urer of tho concern, fired a bullet
into his back and then turned the
gun on himself. A coroner's jury
found that Vollmer camo to his
death by gunshot wound inflicted
with the intent to murder. Traylor
was charged with murder.
Some new details which It Is be
lieved will have great bearing on tho
shooting were brought out at the
liuiticst which was conducted in the
court of Justice l,ee Daniel yesterday
afternoon when first-hand stores by
eye witnesses were brought out. It
whs presumably established that
money troubles led to tho shooting.
I'.inplojCH Testify.
Threo employes of the company
testified that throughout the morn
ing of the day of the shooting Voll
mer and Traylor had been closing
up tho business of the firm and pre
paring to dispose of it to K. Chas
taln. All declared that there had
been no semblance of a disagree
ment between the two men nor had
they ever heard them quarrel over
any matter.
Miss Hazel Kepner, collector for
the lied I in 1 1 company, was the only
eye witness to the tragedy and she
told an Interesting story when railed
to tho stnnd.
"I was Just coming Into the office
when I saw Mr. Traylnr step up be
hind Mr. Vollmer, who was sitting
at his desk, and fire a revolver at
his back," sho said.
"Quit your fooling, I told him,
thinking he could not be In earnest,
but be paid no attention and pointed
the gun at himself and fired again.
Then I ran out and called for help."
No Ilarvli Words.
Questioned further, Miss Kepner
said sho had never heard a harsh
wonl jiass between the two men.
Fred Vincen. another employe of
the company, said that he was Just
outside the office when he heard the
first sho and did not run in until
the second report was heard.
"What did you shoot me for?" he
said Mr. Vollmer unked Traylor. Ac
cording to Vincent. Traylor did not re
ply to the question, but said, "Tell
mv wife and babies I hated to do
this " . (
Mrs. Ralph C. Smith, stenographer
for the firm, was questioned next.
She said that she did not witness
the affair, having left the office about
IS minutes before (he shooting.
She said Vollmer. Trnvlor nsrt
Chastain were In the office when she
left and were figuring' up some ac
counts and preparing to turn over the
i.usiness. Asked if Trnvlor had
money Invested In the company, she
sain mat sue believed he had put
some in about the first of the
month,
"Was Itobblne Mo."
Officer A. D Nichols who was on
the scene of the shooting Just after
it happened. testified that Traylor
wild. "He was robbing me and I was
tired or It." The story told by Offi
cer Xablnsky was along the same
line.
The coroner's Jury was out of the
courtroom only a few minutes when
they returned with the m'ltder ver
dict.
Assistant County Attorney Kd War.
ren Immediately filed an information
chsirEing Traylor with murdering
vollmer.
The condition of Mr. Trnvlor, who
Is now at the Tulsti hospital, was
said to be excellent and there Is now
utile doubt of his ultimate recovery.
A report was current last nlcJit ttint

ren. He talked rationally on every
topic but the shooting, but professed
to know nothing shout the tragedy.
He ;iked the sttorney if he was shot

Former President of Vene

Charge; Is Moral Turpitude
as It Was in 191. When
Trouble Arose.
NT-AV YOI1K, July 15. Oeneral
Clprlano Custro, former presi
dent of Venezuela, who was admitted
to the Fnited States in 1013 after be
ing detained by the immigration au
thorities for six weeks on Kills island,
in: 'l in was denied admission to this
country today when he arrived from
Port of Spain, Trinidad.
His detention was upon orders re
ceived from Washington. it was
learned tonight- General Castro was
permitted to remain aboard ship to
await tho outcome of a hearing beforo
a .'ipecril board of inquiry tomorrow.
Assistant Commissioner of Immi
gration Myron II. l;bl asserted that
the charges against General Castn
weie the same as three years ago, In
volving moral turpitude. Mr. I'hl ex
plained that a special board of in
quiry in 1912 had ordered General
Castro excluded from the country.
General Castroi, however, sued out
a writ of hahca-s corpus In a federal
court and was permitted to Itnd. The
government nppealed and, Mr. Fhl
said, General Castro, who had been
liicsti'd to furnish a bond, volun
tarily left the country before tho ap
peal was heard.
Greatly rcrlnrlwil.
General Castro appeared greatly
pettiitbid when Informed he would
not be permitted to come ashore. Iiu
denied his visit was of a political na
ture. "Reports that I have come to New
York for political reasons or for con
ference with Ijitin-Amerlcan leaders,"
said General Castro, "are .absolutely
unfounded. I have no political in
terests whatsoever and happen to be
In New York simply because I could
not go direct from Trinidad to I'orto
Rico, where my family now Is. i
Intended to take the first boat I can
get."
General Castro said a revolution In
Venezuela at this time rould not suc
ceed for many reasons, despite the
fact that the condition of the coun
try was bad. both po'lti-ully and fi
nancially. He deprecated the possK
bility of war betwen Venezuela and
Colombia over the boundary dispute,
owing to the fact that the difficul
ties were "perfectly negotiable."
General Castro indicated that he
thought his present trouble merely
"red tape."

VI AIKKGAN, July 15. William

charged with murdering Marion
Lambert, a high school girl and his
former sweetheart, was found not

Three ballots were taken. Tho

quittal. Foreman O'Sliea stuted that
by agreement the name of tic mem
ber who voted for conviction would
not be mailo public.
The Jury retired at 2:50 o'clock.
Tho defendant, as usual, was seated
between his mother and Mrs. Kdwin
Taylor, his landlady at Madison,
Wis.,, when tho Jury filed In. Only
ouo sound broke the stillness with
which for a few seconds the verdict
was received. H came from a
woman about fifty years old dressed
In black who had attended every ses
sion of the court. Sho made an In
articulate sound something between
a sob and a shriek. She hail never
explained her Interest in the case ex
cept to say that she was "a friend
ol humanity."
Orpet Was Silent.
Orpet was. silent. He was barely
able to return the haudcl.isps of his
attorneys. Hi) accepted the hand of
a reporter but muttered a scarcely
perceptible "please don't." He made
his way to the Jurors and shook
their hands one by one, smiling
wanly hut saying nothing.
Mrs. Orpet did not lose her self
possession for a second. She received
the verdict as a mere matter of rou
tine. She noted that a photographer
was trying to snap a picture of her sou
and herself, and warned nun, mean
while shielding her own face with a
newspaper.
James H. Wilkerson, chief of coun
sel for the defense, was unable to keep
back the tears. Mr. Wilkerson stated
that in his opinion Orpet had beta
more than declared not guilty.
Proven Innocent.
"Ho was proved innocent," said Mr.
Wilkerson. He is going home with
his mother now. Then he Is going into
the country for a much needed rest
after the nerve racking experience
brought on him by a remarkable, if
not unprecedented series of circum
stances. Then he wilt come Hack
home and make a man of himself.
The defendant, his father and
mother, his brother. Mrs. Taylor and
Intimate friends nmde their way into
the witness room where their privacy
was safeguarded by a bailiff. Half
an hour later they emerged.
"We'll go home now, William," said
Mrs. Orpel. and they made their way
down the back stairs and to the Jail.
Orpct's few belongings which he
had in his cell were already packed.
He hud recovered his self-poscssion
by this time and thanked Sheriff
Griffin for making his four months'
stay In jail as comfortable as pos
sible. The important evetits of the trial all
occurred on the fifteenth. The se
lection of the jury began May 15; tho
taking of testimony was begun Jun
15, and acquittal July 15.

lier Which Sinks After
Hurricane.
CHARI.KSTON. S. C, July 15.
All of the 142 persons aboard
the large naval collier Hector, which
grounded and broke in two off Cape
Romain, S. C, Friday night, were
brought hero today but many of
them were badly bruised and bat
tered from their experiences and
four of the collier's crew were se
verely injured. The latter were taken
to hospitals here.
Tho terrific hurricane that swept
the Carolina coast and wrecked the
collier took no toll of life other than
that of a negro here and another at
Savannah, unless some forty men
abourd eight barges adrift sh uld
perish. The Hector is expected to
be a total loss.
The tug Wellington, commanded
by Captain Nelson, left here today
to search for her two barges which
broke away during the hurriouns. It
was the Wellington which rescued
121 persons from the Hector. The
lighthouse buoy-tender Cypress,
which took off the other 21 early to
day, went to sea after buoys and
other aids to navigation which the
hurricane tore- loose. The tugs Caro
