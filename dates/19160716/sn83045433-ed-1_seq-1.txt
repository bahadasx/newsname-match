Youth Cleared of Charge of
- Murdering Marian Lambert,
Cast-off Sweetheart.
JURY OUT FIVE HOURS
(By the Interntienal1 News Service.)
Waukegan, Ill., July 15.-Will Orpet has
been found not guilty of the murder of
his sweetheart, Marion la mbert.
On the fourth ballot the jury agreed
on the verdict. From the first only one
juror thought the State ha4 proven that
the cyanide of potasium, which caused
the schoolgirl's death. had been given to
her in the guise of medicine by the young
college student. After three votes this
juror went over to the majority.
At 7:46 this evening the jury filed into
court and the foreman handed Judge
Donnelly the verdict. He read It and
passed it on to the court clerk, who
read aloud to the breathless throng that
packed the stifling court room:
"We. the jury, find the defendant. Will
iam Orpet, not guilty."
The most composed person in the room
was Orpet. While the jury was deliber
sting, he said, with a confident smile:
"I will eat breakfast with my mother
tomorrow morning."
When the verdict was read he stepped
over and kissed his mother and the whole
case became merely an episode in his
life. He was ready to go home to dinner.
Hiis mother wept for joy
There was a faint attempt to cheer
when the verdict was read, but the bail
iffs sternly repressed it. Judge Donnelly
had already given warning that any
demonstration %would be punished with a
jail sentence for contempt of court.
The jury spent five hours discussing
the case. The trial has lasted exactly
two months.
Owing to the prejudice against Orpet1
among the talesmen. twenty-one days of
this time were occupied in obtaining
a jury.
