regardleSfl of the protests of the United
States. The Navy League and some of
the National I.iberals joined in this
agitation, declaring that it was the
only means of bringing the war through
to a auccessful conclusion.
A dispatch from Berlin under da'e of
July I t-aid thar the campaign in favor
of the resumption of active submarine
war was going on cpergetically. One
of the two purposes of the agitation |
was said to be a movement Bgainsl
