LONDON". July 1.".. The Germans
at one point have been forced back
to the third line of their defense un
der smashing British blows, four miles
behind their original front. General
Haig reported to the war ollice this
afternoon.
The report said that the llritish had
pushed from Frieourt to Mametz. cap-
turing 2.oo prisoners in iwniy-iimr
hours. This brought the total of pris
oners since the beginnig of the Anglo
French offensive a fortnight ago to
10.000. Much material was also tak
en. Special dispatches from Paris this
afternoon reported that the Germans
have retired on the French front ad
joining the llritish on the the Albert
railway. The llritish advances made
retreat necessary.
The reference to the advance made
by the rear from Frieourt to Mametz
emphasized the gains made by the
British in the fighting yesterday. The
first and second British lines appar
ently have advanced well beyond Ma
metz. with a third running through
the woods, where desperate fighting
took place.

LOXDOX. July IT.. Heavy German
counter attacks slowed up the mo
mentum of the llritish advance today.
Desperate fighting took place at
Ovillers. The British, despite fierce
and stubborn resistance, penetrated
the German second line where they
were met with a steady fire from many
machine guns. The Germans are
fighting fiercely all along their line,
but the British advance slowly con
tinues. In the "Ovillers region the
Germans turned a hot artillery fire on
the British.
Most of the town of Ovillers is in
British hands. War correspondents
at the front say that hundreds of bod
ies lie under the ruins of the town.

"The Missouri News Letter." a new
idea of II. F. Schulte in lining up his
football men. is now being sent out
to the Tiger football candidates.
Schulte, who is spending the stim-
mer in Marcellus, Mich., has got out a j
small size newspaper m wh.ch bo,
gives extracts of letters from many of (
next year's prospects, clippings from,
newspapers and instructions to the
future Tiger stars.
In what corresponds to the editorial
column in a newspaper the Tiger foot
ball mentor predicts a hard season for
Missouri, but at the same time is op
timistic; says that all the other teams
are stronger this year than last, but
does not mention any games that
.Missouri will lose; and ends up by
telling the men to study the rules and
get in condition so as to be ready to hit
the line hard and low the first day.

nine false gods which people wor

one true god.
"The false god which the people of
drink worship and which the good
temperance women are fighting is the
god of rum," said Mr. Bryan.
"The people in this country spend
two and a half million dollars a year on
the worship of this false god. This
is three times more than the amount
spent for education.
"If we stopped spending that mon
ey for education, our nation would
move backward, but if we stopped
spending that money for rum and
spent it for education our nation
would progress forward rapidly.
Mr. Bryan urged total abstinence
so that moderate drinking would not
be an example for the young man to
start. He also emphasized the pledge
idea which he started with a neighbor
of his who drank abundantly. He
told what he accomplished after he
started the movement of getting school
boys to sign the pledge not to touch
liquor. The signing of a pledge indi
cated a desire not to drink.
The eight other false gods which
he dwelt upon were the gods of gold.
fashion, fame, ease, intellect, travel.
chance and passion.
To avoid serving the nine false gods,
Mr. Bryan urged that everyone place
self in the background and serve God.
A man's duty is first to God and then
to his neighbor.

BALTIMORE, July 15. Down along
the water front today they puffed on
their strong old pipes and wagered
the German submarine Dcutschland
would never run the Allied patrol off
the Virginia capes.
Captain Kocnig down at the dock
only smiled and kept his men busy
loading her up. He was confident of
success. He did not brag. He told
friends, however, he would pass the
Allied warships shortly. Just how he
will accomplish this remarkable feat
he did not say, but he smiled and
winked knowingly.
Some persons connected with the
loading of the Dcutschland said she
would dash out tonight. This seems
improbable, however, though she may
finish loading by tonight. Everything
points to a getaway before Tuesday.
