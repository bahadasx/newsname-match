fourteen miles north-northeast of Cape

of their flcrht against fires that broke
out while the vessel pitched in rolling

she went aground.
It developed to-day that the reason
rescuers were late i? reaching her
was that the Hector first reported her

nounced by the Charleston Navy-Yard,
but that in reality she was off Cape

The appointment of Representative
James Hay, of the Seventh District, as
a member of the I'nlted States Court
of Claims and his impending retirement
from Congress to accept the appoint
ment caused a decided stir in Richmond
political circles yesterday, and long
distance conferences between local and
.Seventh District leaders .were the order
of the day.
First among the important develop
ments was the announcement by close
friends of Judge Thomas W. Harrison,
?f Wincheptor, that he will he a candi
date for the vacancy created by Mr.
Hay's retirement. Judge Harrison is a
former law partner of Richard Evelyn
Fi;. rd, former Speaker of the House of
I 'elesra tes.
Judge Harrison's term as presiding
Judge of the Seventeenth Judicial Cir
cuit does not expire until 1922. In
recent ;f a rs he has been frequently
mentioned as a probable candidate for
the State Supreme Court to succeed
Judge George M Harrison, of Augusta
whenever he should retire from the
bench. The latter's term expires in
IMS. and, under the terms of the
amended judiciary pension act. ha
would be eligible, upon retirement, to
a life pension on the same terms as
Judge Keith, who has already retired.
While Circuit Judge Harrison has
never held Federal office, he was for
two terms a member of the State Sen
ate He was also a member of tha
Constitutional Convention of 1902-03.
Judge Harrison is a native of Lecs
-burg, Loudoun County, and belongs to
a family long prominent in public, af
fairs r.f the State and nation. He is
a graduate of the University of Vir
ginia and has been on the circuit
1 bench for about fifteen years.
OTIIP.lt ("AXniDATES
A It 15 EXrEPTRI) TO Rl'X
That thor#- will be other candidates
is taken for granted. Representative
Hay has been a member of Congress
from the Seventh District for eighteen
years consecutively, and congressional
timber has grown up without a chance
to rear its head in Washington. The
retirement of Mr. Hay will create in
the Seventh a political situation full
of stirring possibilities.
Among others who are looked upon
as potential candidates for the Seventh
District congressional seat are Judge
. R. T. W. Duke, of Charlottesville; State
Senator N. R. Early, Jr., of Greene;
' State Senator H. H. Downing, of War
ren: former State Senator George R
Keezell, of Rockingham; former State
I Senator F. S. Tavenner, of Shenandoah;
Captain R. S. Parks, of Duray; Aubrey
Weaver, of Page, and State Senator
j George N. Conrad, of Rockingham;
! Judge A. D. Dabney and Hallis Rine
hart. of Charlottesville; former Com
| monwealth's Attorney Herbert S Lar
rick, of Frederick, and Judge E. X.
Newman, of Woodstock.
j The district possesses able men 'n
large number, many of whom have
had long experience in public affairs.
Should a contest develop In Democratic
ranks, it will probably be a lively one.
In old convention days the. Seventh Dis
? trlct congressional nomination was
| frequently determined only aftor pro
tracted meetings of the most exciting
character. Since Mr^ Hay's election,
twenty years ago. the nomination has
gone to him year after year prac
tlcally without contest. Now tha
there is opportunity for beginning a
new dynasty, tha rival forces of tha
district will naturally be brought Into
play.
TRANS-I!I,UE Hinr.E COUNTIES

A natural assumption is that tha
trans-Blue Ridge counties will lay
claim to tho office on the ground that

four counties east of the Rlue Ridge,

REASONS FOR APPOINTMENT
Remarkable Tribute Paid in
House When Announce
ment Is Made.
[Special to The Times-Dispatch.]
WASHINGTON. July 15. ?Represents-i
tive James Hay. of Virginia, chairman ,
I of the Hon?'- 'Committee on Military
Affairs, leader of the "small-army";
forces in Conpress and the storm
feniT of the lecisiatlve battle over;
J th?* army reorganization hill. to-<lay ?
j was nominated by I'r^sid^nt Wilson to
be a judge of the United St,ates Court
of Claims. Mr. Hay will retire from
I Congress at the <-n'l of the present ses
sion to arr?>pi the appointment. The
position is for lifetime, and pays $G,ono
[ a year. After ten years' service the
I holder may retire on full pay.
Mr. Hay has represented the Seventh
| Vircinia District in Congress for
j twenty years, and since his youth has
i been a power in the Virginia Derno
i crati'* political organization. He now
j is about sixty.fives years old. He
served as Commonwealth's attorney of
1 his county, and in the House and Sen
ate of the Virginia. Assembly before:
coming to Congress. His rolleagues
. believe confirmation will he voted
; promptly bv the Senate
Representative S. H. Pent, of Ala
bama. ranking Democratic member,
automatically will become chairman of
the Military Committee for the re
mainder of the session upon Mr. Hay's
roti rement.
DEFEAT OK GARRISON PLAN
due to his influence
To him. more than any other one man j
in Concre's. was due the defeat of
former Secretary Garrison's plan for
organizing a Federal continental volun
teer army as a reserve behind the reg
ulars. He has opposed a. large regular
army, but agreed to a considerable in-,
I crease in the reorganization bill origi
nally reported by his committee.
The announcement of Mr. Hay's
nomination hit Congress like a bomb
shell. Only a half-dozen of the Vir
ginian's most intimate friends had any
knowledge that the appointment would
be made. Neither Mr. Hay nor those
on the "inside" had any idea that the
nomination would be sent to the Sen
' ate so soon.
The appointment of Mr Hay gave
rise to a great deal of political con- i
je~ture in Congress. There were re
ports that the President desired to
eliminate Mr. Hay's influence in plans
to strenethen the army, as the Vir
ginian has persistently stood for his
own "small-army" views in all the
preparedness legislation. There were
other reports that Mr. Hay, on account
of his stand for a small army, faced
defeat in the Seventh Virginia District,
which he has represented in Congress
for twenty years.
APPOINTMENT TENDERED
TO HAY IN FEBRUARY
The Times-Dispatch correspondent,
however, learns on trustworthy author
ity that the appointment was tendered
i Mr. Hay last February by the Presi- !
; dent shortly after Judge George G. !
Atkinson retired under the age re-,
tlrement law. The selection of Mr. Hay1
j was brought about this way, according
to reliable information.
i Last fall Mr Hay told a close friend j
that he was getting weary of the ardu
ous labors in Congress, and expressed
a wish to end his career on the bench
1 in Washington. This friend, who is
not identified with public life, told
President Wilion. who expressed a
readiness to gratify the wish of the
Virginian. The President, it is stated,!
kept the matter in mind, and about six
? months later a vacancy on the Court
of claims was created by the retire-'
ment of Judge Atkinson. Shortly after
wards the President asked Mr. Hay if
he desired this appointment. The \
whole matter was kept as a closed
book, and only a few intimate friends
of the Virginian knew about it.
Mr. Hay's retirement will create a i
> vacancy in the House from the Seventh
Virginia District, for which there will
be a big scramble. A half-dozen lead- j
ing Democrats will seek the Democratic |
nomination. Names of those who. It
i? understood in Washington, will be
; candidates for the Democratic nomina
! tion are Judge W. T. Harrison, of Win
Chester: State Senator H. B. Early, of
Greene; State Senator Conrad, of Rock- j
Ingham; Judge R. T. N\ Duke, of Albe
marle; former State Senator Blackburn :
1 Smith, of Clarke, and State Senator j
H H. Downinc. of Front Royal. United
i States District Attorney Richard Eve
i lyn Bvrd, of Winchester, will not be :
: a candidate, it is stated, and will give
i his support to Judge Harrison.
HARRISON AND DIKE
EXPECTED TO LEAD
' The impression prevails here that j
i tho contest will be between Judge ]
| Harrison and Judge Duke. Although ,
! Judge Harrison's plans are not fully j
' developed, it is understood that he in- j
' tends to be a candidate, and will re- j
I s'gn from the Circuit Court bench J
within a f?.w days in order to make the
race. Tt is also expected that State
Senator Smith, of Berryville, and Sen- j
ator Downing, of Front Royal, will be j
in the race. They have Indicated a
desire to their friends to make the
race, for Congress in the event Mr. Hay
retired from Congress.
Mr. Hay came to Congress in 1896, on
the crest of the Bryan "free-silver"
wave. He succeeded tho late Judge
Turner, of Front Royal, who refused a
renomlnatIon for Congress after the
Democratic party made free silver the
paramount issue in its presidential

noon permits about 100 soldiers to
spend Sunday as they choose and gives
them a well-earned holiday from the
routine of camp life.
Filled with hard work, healthy liv
ing: and freedom from care, the days
of the soldiers at Camp Stuart are
profitable, but not sensational. Few
developments occurred yesterday. The
engineers were mustered into State
service last night, sixty-two strong,
and will receive uniforms ar.d equip
ment to-day, it is stated.
Although these men took the State
oath several days ago, they did not |
then have the required number to be
officially recognized as a company in
the organized militia. From taking
the oath the onlj advantage pained
was that desertion was prevented, and
the men already on the list were held
until enough others joined for the
whole body to be mustered in.

REDUCED EASLEY'S EIGCRES
Craddock Reported $200,000 as Cap

Local Roard Reduced Amount Sub
[ ject to Taxation to $348,025.
Publication yesterday of a state- j
merit from John \V. Craddock, of Lynch- !
burg, setting' forth }>is views as to the '
alleged errors of James S. Easley. rie-1
posed examiner of records of the Sixth
Circuit, in assessing fhe capital of thai
Craddock - Terry Co. drew attention
anew to the quite opposite views with
reference to the sanie assessments that
are held by the office of the Attorney
General of Virginia.
According to Mr. Craddock. Mr. Eas
ley erre.rl in assuming that he had the
right to consider the larger part of the
capital of the Craddock-Terry Co. as
exclusively "manufacturing capital"
without taking into consideration the
fact that the law provides, to quote
Mr. Craddock. '"that the mercantile
department of a corporation engaged
both as manufacturers nnd merchants i
shall he taxed by one method and the
manufacturing department taxed by
another method."
Other errors on the part of Mr. Eas
ley are alleged by Mr. Craddock. but
this is the one which is responsible
for the greater part of the variance
between the assessment as reported by
the examiner of records and the re
duced assessment as made by (he local
board of review and held by Mr. Crad
dock to be correct.
While the question of the correct
ness of Mr. Easley's assessment of the
Craflrlock property is yet to be finally
determined, and is not directly related
to the unrest that has followed his
summary removal by the Tax Board,
it is popularly looked upon as the
starting point of tho dissatisfaction
with Mr. Easley's services that cul
minated in quite a general movement
to bring about his removal.

Reference to the records in the At- .

fact that at a meeting held in the

on Taxation unanimously adopted thai
following resolution: j
"It being suggested to the hoard I
that there has been an erroneous:
assessment for the year 101.*> of the i
capital of the Craddock-Terry Co., of:

charged with murdering Marion Lam
bert. a high-school girl, and his former
sweetheart, was found not guilty l>y aj
jury in Judge Donnelly's court after!
five hours' deliberation.
The jury retired at oclock. At
fi o'clock its members were taken to !
dinner, where they spent, half an hour, j
One hour later came word that a ver- i
diet haa been reached. Probably fifty J
persons were still waiting for it. i
Orpet was sent for in his cell and Judge i
Donnelly was still at the courthouse.
Three ballots were taken. The first
two stood 11 to 1 for acquittal.
Orpet was silent through excess of;
emotion. He was barely able to return \
the handclasps of his attorneys. He '
made his way to the jurors and shook
their hands one by one, smiling, but j
saying nothing.
Mrs. Orpet noted that a photographer'
was trying to snap a picture of her son
and herself, and warned hiin, mean
while shielding her own face with a
newspaper.
The defendant, his father and mother1,
his brother and several friends hurried
into tho witness room, where their
privacy was safesuarded by a bailiff.
Half an hour later they emerged.
"We'll home now. William." Mrs.
Orpet said, and they made their way
down the back stairs and to the jail.
OXE or .MOST I.Mi
CASES IX ( ltl.MI.XAIi IIISTOItV
The case of Marion Lambert and
William H Orpet in the course of its
development became one of the most
perplexing in the annals of criminal
history. Motive paralleled motive, ac
tion paralleled action, opportunity par
alleled opportunity until the marks of
murder and of suicide became sub
stantially as one.
In the end, the guilt or innocence of
tho defendant, so far as the adduction
of actual facts was concerned, went to
the Jury on the mystifying niceties of
chemical analysis and Orpet's own com
promising conduct. The mystery at
tracted unusual interest in all parts i>f
the United States and Canada
Trial of the case, including selection
of a jury, occupied the better part of
two months There appeared in evi

Orpet to Marion over a period of a year:

of cyanide from the McCormick estate,
