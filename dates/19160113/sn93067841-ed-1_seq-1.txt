{ LEGISLATURE CONVENED TUES-j
DAY-PRESIDENT INDORSED?
STRUGGLE FOR ECONOMY.
r
Columbia, January 11The House
returns to Columbia with the unusual
and remarkable record of no
^deaths in its membership during the
.J year. Three new members, Messrs
v Richard B Belser, of Sumter, R Burton
Hicks, of Spartanburg, and J i
Terry Wood, of Greer, were sworn
in to take the places of members
who had resigned.
The House buckled down to real
work today?a most unusual proceeding.
Several bills left over
from last session were considered.
(The most striking of the day's
proceedings was the endorsement of
President Woodrow Wilson and his
administration. Representative Big(
/ ham, of Aiken, presented the resoA
lution that was passed without ob
?
jection. It reads:
} A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION.
Whereas, the nation has prosper>
ed in peace during the administration
of Woodrow Wilson, our great
Democratic President, despite the
menacing perils of war and financial
panic, and the chaotic conditions
existing in other lands: and
Whereas, these blessings, in large
part, are attributable to the wis.
dom, the patience and sound judgk
ment of President Wilson, and to
the wise and excellent legislation
I suggested by him and enacted largely
through his influence; now, therefore,
be it
Resolved, by the House of Representatives
of the State of South Carolina,
the Senate concurring, That
we cordially approve and endorse
the eminently able, wise and satisfactory
administration of our National
Government under the Presidency
of Woodrow Wilson, and that
we earnestly commend him to the
jt Democratic party for renomination,
^ and to the people of the United
States for re-election.
Be it further resolved, That a duly
certified copy of these resolutions, 1
signed by the Speaker of the House
and the President of the Senate, be I
forwarded to the President at Washington.
HOLDING THE LID DOWN.
From a State standpoint the resolution
of the ways and means committee
was the most important thing
done today. This resolution projrides
that the committee shall keep
/ the appropriation within the two
4 \
million dollar mark.
There was an unexpected rush of
new bills this morning, the majority
being those fathered by Messrs
Wolfe, of Anderson, and McManan,
of Columbia.
Such a thing as tackling the Calendar
on the first day of the session
is almost unheard of, but it was
done on the House side today. Sev- i
k eral measures were made special 1
W orders. Several bills were made 1
special orders and a few were with- i
drawn. i

'day, in opening the session, he said: ;
MR HOYT'S GREETING. j
*" -? - tt ? tit ':
tientiemen or tne nouse: we ore j
again assembled today to transact
the business of the State as the representatives
of the people of South
Carolina, and it is not my desire nor {
my purpose to delay your work by j
any extended remarks. I feel that j
at our first session, one year ago, j!
the policies of this body werej!
wrought out, and, that at the pres- j j
ent session there is little that we j
should do except to perfect the f
measures which embody those poli- 2
cies, should they need perfecting; i
then to pass the necessary annual \
legislation and adjourn on time. As
your presiding officer I stand ready
to facilitate your work, and in the
discharge of this duty I feel assured
of the kind patience and consideration
which every member of this
House extended to me at the session
of 1915.
We welcome several new members
today. Several have retired to assume
other public duties. We may
well thank a kind Providence that
during the recess our membership
has not been touched by death.
We meet today under very differQ
ent economic conditions. Our peo- ^
pie have largely, and by their own 8
I i
efforts, recovered from the condi- 1
tions which oppressed our thoughts
twelve months ago. But the lessons e
of that experience abide with us, w
enjoining in public as well as private a
business economy and conservatism. ^
In opening this session let me n
again ask your co-operation in the
performance of the duties which P
you have devolved upon me, and'a
your indulgence for my shortcom- *
ings in their performance."

SENATE IN BRIEF SESSION.
rr
In a session of one hour today the
Senate listened to the reading of the
annual message of Governor Man- j fining,
in which he struck what ap-1
pears to be the key note when he j
said, "The State must have progress, I tj
but it must be an economical prog-j t|
ress." The message was referred to i
the proper committee. Its reading |
attracted close attention on the part t|
of the Senators.
The Senate was called to order by
Senator LeGrand Walker, president
pro tern in the absence of Lieutenant
Governor A J Bethea. President
Walker voiced the hope of the Senate
when he said they wished a safe a!
and speedy return of the Lieutenant 0
Governor from his trip to Europe y<
with the Ford peace expedition. He
also voiced the regret of the Senate ei
over the loss of Senator Appelt by p
death since the close of the last ^
meeting. He urged the Senate to ^
fix their determination only on the a
passage of useful legislation and the *(
3peedy enactment of such measures
I TJ?
and wished for everyone a happy jr
New Year. j ?

by the ways and means eomlittee
to hold the appropriation bill

'his is nearly $500,000 less than was
ppropriated last year and over
1,100,000 less than is asked for this

i LARGE BRITISH BATTLESHIP
KING EDWARD VU BLOWN LP
BY MINE-CREW SAVED.
|
| London, January 9:?The remainI
ing positions on Gallipoli peninsula
; held by the allies have been abandoned
with the wounding of only
jone man among the British and
' French, according to a British ofHI
pinl ctntpmpnt issnpd tonight.
i ? -
This news has been expected for
several days, for the retirement of
the troops from Anzac and from
jSuvla Kay three weeks ago left no
1 strateeic advantage to the retention
j of the top of the peninsula.
Nevertheless, the news will be received
with a pang of regret by the
people of the British Isles, as well as
the colonies,
Renewed activity of various kinds
noted by the Turkish official com-!
munieations in the past few days!
has presumably been in the nature j
of preparations for the final act of I
the Dardanelles tragedy. Tonight's j
Turkish official statement covering
the period from Thursday to Saturi
day, records increasing effectiveness
of the reinforced Turkish batteries, j
which have been drawing in and con- j
centrating on the allies' remaining!
position.
Another pang to the British public i
will be caused by the announcement j
tonight of the loss of the battleship
King Edward VII, which has been
blown up by a mine. The brief official
statement on the incident does
not reveal the scene of the accident
and merely says that the disaster
occurred in a heavy sea, despite
which the entire crew was saved be- j
fore the ship went down.
tv.?. Twiner F.Huuflrd VIT renresented I
an investment of nearly ?1,600,000,
and was one of the finest of the last
class of pre-dreadnaughts, corresponding
in general to the American
ships of New Jersey and Nebraska
type, and was only slightly older
than the Natal, which was sunk by
an internal explosion about a week
ago.
