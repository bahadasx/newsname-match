"Liberty."
We have before us oue of the
greatt words used in the Eng-
lisb language. What does "Lib-
3HTY" meau? Paul said:
"Stand fast tlnrsfoie in' the
liberty wherewith Christ hath
made us Irw, and be not entangl-'
od airain will) the voko of bond-
age." (Gal. 51.)
We nave advice hero to stand ,
fast in the Libeny which Chi isi
made us free in. For it 'feadV
"whom Christ makes free, is
free indeed- " Then "Liuijrty"
means sometning to us. A short1
time ago when t.ie "Cld Linerty
Bell of Philadelphia" was taktn
from its resting placu where it
bad been since Jul jr the 4th. 1770

We believe that this Revela-
I
tion has direct reference to, qur ,
own Declaration at the, city of!
Philadelphia,
Yet it is true as recorded, they
shall try to take our Liberty,
granted us by oor Old Patriotic
Pore fathers of this country and
while some of our Liberties have
been taken, and, we feel the
sting of them; yet the promise
is, they shall epme back to- us
because the door of ''Liberty',
cannot be shut by man any
more, .So believing that Bible
Socialism will in the near future
rule the world. We remaih, as
ever. -.- '

We do not care how many lives
you take of youi- fellows to get it

when we get all the go'd and

mountains, and exalted above the
high hiils aud people shall flow
to.it.' And nations sDali say come
and let us go up to the mountain
of the house of the Lord for i:e
will teach us of his ways' and we
will walk in his paths, for the
law shall go forth of Zion, and
the word of the Lord from Jeru

God will rebuke strong nations
afar off and they shall beat their
swords into plowshares, and
their spiers into pruning hooks,
and nation shall not lift.up sword
against nation neither shall thev
learn wm- any more. And everv
man shall sit under bis vine andDenold I create Jerusalem a re-
tig tree and 'tio man dare molest
or make afraid. What a ernrul
Socialist government this will be
no more swords, but plowshears
no more spears, but pruning
hooks. May our President see
what a grand law this is, and in
the place of preparing and mak
ing the army larger and biger.
He will confide in Bible Socialism
ana prepare plowsheirs and
pruninghooks and get ready for
God's time hereon eartb whan
his shall rebuke strong nations,
(money gods) and make them
tbrow their money to the moles
and the bats and bring this
system and form of government

READ THE CRESSET.
A little one shall become a
thousand and a small one a
strong nation: I the Lord will'
hasten it in his time." (Isa.
60-17-22.)
And then the people will jive '
under God's - government and
follow up his law in this manner: "
"For behold I create new
heavens and a new eartb. and
the former shall not be remem
bered nor come into mind.
But be ye glad and rejoice for
ever in that which I create for
dicing and her people a joy.
Atid I will rejoice in Jerusalem
and joy in my people and the
voice of weeping shall no more
bo heard in her nor the voice of
crying"
There shall be no mbre thence
an infant of days nor an old man
that hath not tilled his days; for
the child shalj die an hundred
years old; but the sinner being
an hundred years old shall be
accursed.
And they shall build, houses
and inhabit them and they shall
plant vineyards and eat the fruit
of them.
They shall not build and an
other inhabit they shall not plant
f,0 a ,
. : . .... . ,
pie and mine elect shall long
enjoy the work of their hands.
They shall not labour in vain
nor bring forth for trouble for
they are the seed of the blessed
of the Lord and their offspring
with them.
Aud it shall come to pass, that
before 'they call, I will answer:
and while they are yet speaking
will hear.
The wo'f and tne lamb slial
feedtogethcr, and tho lion shx II
e:u straw like the bullock; and
dust shall be the serpent's meat.
They shall not hurt nor destroy
in all my holy mountain, saith
the Lord. (Isa. i): 17 to 25.)
No more war here, no more
preparedness here. God's gov
ernment is set up as in the begia
niug m ty &od hastei the time
as He says He will do and the
parasites and grafters, with
preparedness cut off from the
face of the earth, is our prayer.
