This is an honor that cannot be
lightly esteemed. It is a great honor
to the local lodge of Masons to have
this commission come to one of its
members, and the honor bestowed up
on Mr. Moultrie is an honor which
could hardly be greater, coming as it
does from the grand lodge of England,
which is the mother grand lodge of
present day Masonry. Grand Secre
tary Stockwell, in making the presen
tation address, emphasized the honor
conferred upon Mr. Moultrie and the
honor which falls to the lodge there
by. He touched upon the years of en
joyment of personal friendship with
Mr. Moultrie, "and, incidentally men
tioned some reminiscences of a trip
across the continent with ,Mr. Moul
trie last summer, much to/ the enjoy
ment of all present. Mr. Moultrie
was almost overwhelmed with sur
prise, as this great honor came so un
expectedly, together with the excep
tional large number of members and
visitors being present without him, as
an officer of the lodge, being a party
to the arrangements. He responded
to the presentation address with' well
chosen words suitable to the occasion,
as he is ever able to do so fittingly,
and, at a banquet a ffew hours later, he
responded to the toast "All
liars."
After adjournment the members con
vened at a seven-course banquet serv
ed by the Hotel Kindred, over one hun
dred being present. Toasts were re
sponded to by Brothers Winterer,
Moultrie, Wm. Smith, Englert and
Stockwell. Brother E. A. Pray acted
as toast-master, a responsibility that
hangs upon his shoulders absolutely
without weight. Mr. Stockwell's res
ponse was in the line of instruction in
living the masonic life. It was much
appreciated. The after-dinner talks
were interspersed by several numbers
rendered by a male quartet composed
of such celebrities as Jules B. Meyer,
A. Zimmerman, C. E. Hunt and F.
H. Buckwalter. We cannot voice our
opinion of this quartet in technical or
musical terms, but we can say it was'
