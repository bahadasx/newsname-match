ICLE'SIP
GETS A BOLD
BA1AN
MISGUIDED INDIVIDUAL WHO
TRIED TO COLLECT "LIVING
THAT THE WORLD OWES HIM,"
MEETS WITH REVERSES.
Some wild-eyed individual who no
doubt lias been a close student of
"Dead-Eye Dick" the bold bandit of
the soup kitchen, and received visual
instruction from a certain six-reel
screecher shown throughout the state
at various picture houses, in which
a certain oft-time candidate, author
and hero, is now In the county jail
of Pushmataha county where he will
have to answer to the charge of hawk
bank robbery. The story was carried
in this morning's Oklahoman under a
Tuskahoma date line, and told of an
attempted hold-up of the bank at that
place, in which A. H. Palmer, for
merly of this city, is the cashier.
The robber succeeded in getting
hold of the cash, all right, but be
failed to notice that old ten-gauge
shotgun which used to be the terror
of all the 'coons, 'possums, squirrels
and other ferocious animals which
infested this vicinity, and that little
oversight will probably cost him a
long term In Dob Dick's hotel at Mc
Alester. After compelling "Uncle Sip" to
hand over the change, he retreated
to his horse which was hitched close
by. In the meantime, friend Palmer
reached for the trusy weapon, and
as the bandit was mnking off he
raised the window, took hasty aim,
and shot the horse.
Now, some of his local friends,
J. D. Spragins, Mike Gorman, "Branch'
Rickey and a few others, were in
clined to believe at first sight that
their old hunting companion was a
littlj "shaky" after his experience.
What he really intended the load for
was the man, but they had better
modify that thought before they start
on their next hunting trip to the
Kiamitia, getting off the train at Tus
kahoma to make the trip overland,
or there will be doings in that little
mountain town in which they are
likely to be "shown" that no excite
ment whatever can 'affect the aim of
"Uncle Sip." At any rate, he got the
man, even if he did have to shoot
the faithful animal from under him,
and as that carries the standing re
ward of $200,. it will be a little solace
to him even if his chaffing friends ;
deluge him with telegrams- and good
advice as to his future practice in
shooting.
Nearly all the sportsmen who visit
the Kiamitia mountains make their
headquarters at Tuskahoma for the
overland trip, and few excursions are
made unless "Uncle Pip" is along. Be
it incidentally remarked that he gets
his share of the game, too.

SHOT TO-DEATH
T

FORCE AT THE TIME FOR
MERLY RESIDED HERE AND
WAS WELL KNOWN.
Roy Thornton, who resided in this
city for several years, and formerly
was a member of the Ardmore lire
department, and later a member of
the police department, was shot to
death in Dallas last night. He was
u member of Ardmore Camp, Wood
men of the World, and Clerk J. K.
Gait of that order says (he remains
will be brought to Provence for bur
ial tomorrow.
Today's Dallas News says:
The long list of Dallas police of
ficers killed and wounded in the dis
charge of their duty was Increased
by two last night when Patrolman
W. U. Thornton was killed and Motorcycle-
orfieer C. C. Booth was so
badly wounded that he will have a
crippled right hand the rest of his
life.
The shooting took place In an alley
running north from Main street, be
tween Lloyd and Pryor streets, about
8 o'clock, following the arrest of a
young man by Officer Thornton on a
misdemeanor charge. Officer Booth,
who was nearby at the time, heard
loud remarks being exchanged be-
tween Thornton and the man he had
in custody, lie hastened to Thornton
and inquired if he needed any as
sistance. Thornton told him no, but
asked him to call the patrol wagon
Boith turned and walked a few steps
nuwn the alley toward Main street
when he heard the roar of n shotgun
a short distance behind him. There
was instantly another blinding "ash
and a loud report, and Booth, upon
attempting to reach for his pistol,
found he was unable to use his right
hand.
Booth heard Thornton cry out to
him; "Call the ambulance," and s'tw
the forms of two men emerge from
the alley and, finding himself unable
to stand on his feet without suffering
pain, he leaned against a telephone
post. A passing automobile, occupied
by C. Mitchell and Tom Finn of 1722
Crockett street, stopped and nxkod
up the wounded officer.
"Drjve nie to the Emergency hos
pital, I am wounded," Booth told the
men, and as the car sped townr'l the
city hall he informed them that "an
other officer is wounded In th alley
near where you found me."
At the Emergency hosp1!.-1! it was
soon ascertained that Booth was ser
iously hurt, and he was rnt to St.
Paul's sanitarium. Mitchell and Finn
then accompanied the emergency
squad from police hend.iuarters to
where Thornton lay wounded and
bleeding in the darkners. He was
still alive when his f11ov officer?
LIST 111
bent over his prostrnfe bodv, to hear .-.freed, and now it is up to the com
him hoarsely whisper, "Boys, I'mlrriMee r.nd the Chamber of Coin-
going to die."
He was picked up and placed in
the squad car and driven directly o
St. Paul's sanitarium, hut as tho big
machine drew up at the entrance to
the sanitarium, Thornton breathed
his last, and was pronounced dead by
Dr. W. W. Samuell a moment later.
The body was taken in charge by
the George A. Brewer company. Ex
amination of the body showed that
Thornton had been shot from the
right side. A charge of buckshot had
struck him in the right arm, com
pletely shattering that member". Sev
eral shot entered the pleural cavity,
severing two large arteries and , en
tering the heart.
Thornton was 27 years of age and
entered the service of the police de
partment July 23, 1913. His record
since that date was perfect and the
only notation made on the record
book was that entered at 9 o'clock
last night by Police Captain Turley,
Killed on the night of Jan. 12, 1915."
Thornton came to Dallas from Ard
more, Okla. Police Commissioner
Winfrey and Superintendent Ryan
said they deplored his untimely end,
as he was rated a fearless ami ef
ficient officer. Commissions Winfrey
directed that everything possible be
done for the comfort and condolence
of Mrs. Thornton.

EEEN SUBMITTED FOR CHAM
EER OF COMMERCE TO SELECT

At the noonday luncheon today, the
hold question was the principal theiiii
of discussion, and the committee sub
mitted several propositions which the
members had received for the Cham
ber of Commerce to select from.

from responsible parties that If the
city would take seventy-five thous
and dollars' worth of stock they would
put up the other seventy-five thous
and, and erect a hundred and fifty
thousand-dollar house. They also re -
reived offers from people who would
erect a building provided a suitable
bonus is given, and the figure fre
quently mentioned was fifty thousand
dollars.
There was a division of opinion as
to which was the best method of
securing the hotel, but the prevailing
opinion was that they had rather
make an outright gift than take stock
in the concern.
Wirt Franklin and several associ
ates stated that if the -city felt like
making a donation of fifty thousand
dollars, he would build the hotel him
self, and would have the work under
way as soon as a suitable site could
be secured. In order to get the sense
of tho meeting, President Mulllen
invited a complete discussion of the
affair, and for that reason the dinner
was delayed until after the regular
hour for closing. The road commit
tee was not ready to report and nil
the time was taken up with the hotel
proposition.
