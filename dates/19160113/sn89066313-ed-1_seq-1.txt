IS BESTJN DECADE"
So S;iys Report of U.S. Com
mittee on Statistics and
Standards.
DR. HILL A MEMBER
Prospect in Striking Contrast
to That at Same Time
Last Year.
Such prospentj during 19 If, as will
recompense the people of the United
States for all their past misfortunes is
predicted in the report of the Com
mittee on Statistics and Standards of
the United States Chamber of Com
merce, just made public. A. W.
Douglas of St. Louis, vice-president of
the Simmons Hardware Companj-,
and well known in Columbia, is chair
man of the committee, while Dr. A.
Ross Hill, president of the University-,
is a member.
The report lias to do with the gen
eral crop and business conditions and
the outlook for business during the
first four months of 1916.
"The outlook for business for the
first four months of 1916 is in strik
ing contrast to that prevailing this
time last jear," sajs the report. "There
are spots where much caution and
conservation jet remain, and the in
fluence of high prices for the future
further acci ntuates this caution be
cause dealers feel that high prices
will curtail buving bj- the consumer.
There are other sections where the
apprehension caused by the Kuropean
War still hangs on. Broadly speaking
and in a general way it may be said
that the spirit of optimism and hope
fulness prevails to a degree that has
not been apparent for nearlj- a de
cade." fcWar Effect Xol so Ilatl."
Speaking of the war's effect tlie re-
, port sajs: "The adverse effect of the
conflict in Kurope still prevails in
some sections though to very much
less extent than at this time last j ear.
There are still scattered fears of the
possibilitj of this countrj hi iug in
volved in the gigantic strife; but as
against this the large portion of the
people are pajing less and less at
tention to the war and more and more
are concentrating their thoughts and
efforts on domestic matters. Bejond
this is the striking fact that the in
fluence of tlie war at present as a
whole is more favorable than adverse,
because of the tremendous impetus it
has given to certain lines of manu
facturing, especially east of the Alie
ghenies, and likewise to manj- agricul
tural products. This influence is a
material factor in the present high
prices of sheep, cattle, wool, grain
and of the products of leather, steel,
iron, copper, brass, lead and zinc or
spelter. Much of the prosperity in
the grain-raising sections is due to
the fact that the farmer is selling
freely because of renumerative figures
for his product and there seems to
be no manner of doubt but that these
prices will decline materiallj- in case
of peace "
Xo prediction is made as to what
will happen to business In case of
peace. Tlie report states that "the
general belief centers around the con
viction that the war will last for
some time and that the part of wis
dom is to make tlie most of the
present situation."
Crop Yields are Heavier.
The crop jields in general, other
than cotton, are said to exceed those
of anj- j ear known to our history.
"This is true In especial of the small
grains as a whole," declares the re
port. "This latter fact is one that Is
most significant and of verj- large
moment lo the country as a whole."
