ternational Corporation Will
Back Industrial Ventures

national Corporation willing to assise
suitable Industrial enterprises," -as
well as attend to Its, steamship, lines,

Sammons, consul-general for the Unit
ed' States, at Shanghai. '
, This corporation was recently form
ed in New York, and capitalized at
$50,000,000, for the purpose of operat
ing a transpacific steamer line, pro
vided assistance could be secured
fiom Congress, in the shape of subsi
dies, a mail contract, or amendment
of the clauses of the Seamen's Law
deemed injurious to American ship
ping. The corporation took over the
remaining ships of the Pacific Mail
fleet, and will operate them in service
between the west coast and South Am
erica. y
" "I talked with several officials of
the corporation In the states," said Mr.
Sammons, "and I found them actively
preparing to assist Industrial under
takings, and furnish the capital for
suitable enterprises, both In the Unit
ed States and foreign countries."
The consul-general also said he
found in his trip- of four months
through the states that an active in
terest is being taken in shipping
problems and the development of the
American merchant marine. He stat
ed that chambers of commerce in all
leading American cities are convinced
that Congress should grant aid by
s'uch means aa will assist American
shipping.
Mr. Sammons refused to discuss the
Chinese revolution. "I have been In
the East 11 years," he said. "Every
diplomat knows what that means."
The consul-general said he is de
lighted with Honolulu. "Your city
seems to have grown appreciably just
since July,- he remarked. "Hawaii
is being talked of much more through
out the states, as an excellent place
to visit either summer or winter."
Mr. Sammons arrived on the U. S.
army transport Sheridan this morning
from San Francisco,' accompanied by
Mrs. Sammons. They have visited the
principal cities of the United States.
Mr. and Mrs. Sammons were enter

Bold Robberies
Yee Yo Keuk this afternoon tola
Chief of Detectives Arthur McDuffie
of a string of burglaries of which he
admits he is guilty until McDuffle got
tired of hearing of them, Keuk. when
he was told that no more details of
his career of crime were wanted, had
admitted 10 robberies, including hold
ups, and had confessed to taking
money, watches, clothing, food and
jewelry from various places. "
Keuk was taken to McDuffie's ornce
by a 'policeman and a detective, - and
was kept closelv guarded. He limped
upstairs with the aid of crutches, as
the wound in his left leg is still pain
ful. The wound In his neck has healed.
The Korean bandit is fat and ir
good health, and except for the wound
in his leg has recovered from the ef
fects of the battle In. which he was
shot and in which he shot McDuffie

for entering a, house and threatening
one of the inmates with a revolver.

Colorado Would Close Down
All But One Beet Sugar Mill,
Says f. G. Bonfijs
INDUSTRY OUTRANKING
RICH GOLD MINES NOW
Denver. Newspaperman Thinks
Wilson Will Be Forced to
Take Hand in Mexico
"If the tariff law providing for free
sugar on May I is not amended," says
F. G. Bonfils of Denver, "Colorado will
close down all but one of her big beet
sugar mills, and practically go out of
the sugar business. One mill would
probably keep .running for the local
trade."
Mr. Bonfils, one of the owners of
the Denver Post, arrived yesterday
with Mrs. Bontls on the Great North
ern, and is stopping at the Moana.
."Our sugar Industry. has come to be
foremost of all our industries fn Colo
rado," continues Mr.; Bonfils. "Colo
rado has long been famous for her
output of gold. and silver, but the beet
sugar business as Xar as dollars and
cents go, is npw ahead of the mines., -
"We produced ast .year," he says,
"6,00(000 sacks, or 600,000,000 "pounds
of beet sugar. . Practically all the pec
pie of Colorado want the tariff main
tained, as you may well believe."
Killed By Free j Sugar. "T
With free trade, Mr. Bonfils says.
Colorado could not begin to compete
with the cheap labor of Cuba. Colo
rado land sells for practically $200 an
acre, and Cubi land -for from 40
to S50 an acre Free sugar would
drive the Colorado sugar men out of
business at once. , . ; "
Asked concerning the Mexican situ
ation as viewed from the Pike's Peak
state, Bonfils , says that . It Is only a
question of time when President Wil
son's "'watchful waiting" policy must
end, and the United States take an
active hand to bring the present con.
dition of things to a .close. '
"Mexico is in the feudal ages still.
he says. "There re a thousand lit
tle cliques here and there over the
country, and I do not believe that
they will ever settle things of their
own accord, v .'-'' -
"Though Mexico is a republic the
oretically, the people of Mexico have
been strangely, backward in any ad
vance toward a republican form of
government, and willingness to let the
majority rule. It is only a questipn of
time until we must Interfere."

Judge - Ashford also berated the
push carts which sell cheap candy and

Regiment of Thousand Mining Men

f Associated Press Service by Fvdwal Wireless. .
WASHINGTON. 1). t, Jan. V) Stwtary of State Lansing has
again issueil a Avarning to Ann'ricans to leave the revolutionary dis
tricts of Mexico. He also says that if final proper steps are not taken
to safeguard lives and property there, there is the possibility of an is
sue arising between the United States and ('aranza. The utterance is
regarded as significant of a determination to enforce protee:on for
Americans. ;
EL PASO, Tex., Jan. 13. Reports telegraphed, to the stat. de
partment from loeal authorities express the belief that Gen. "PaiK hoM
Villa is personally backing an organized campaign having as its
object the extermination of Americans in Chihuahua. His motive is
said 'to' be revenge on the United States because it Tecognized his
rival, Carranza, and a hope also that he will bring intervention by
the United States and a breakdown of the Carranza government.
Preparations are being niede to ship to their homes the bodies
of the men massacred in Chihuahua. ' ..'
It is reported by thosewho have come across the border that less
than 500 Carranza men are on duty as guards in Chihuahua. Mine
officials are very apprehensive for the safety of foreigners in Santa,
Barbara. There is much peril in thenining districts, as bandits are"
reported to be headed there. The employes of the Amerkaa Rineltf
ing Company in Chihuahua and Durango have been orderel out,
following the warning Jssued by the state department.
Expedition
Across
To Punish Villa Men Is Planned
EL.PASO, Texas, Jan. 13. Daily and almost hourly reports of
fresh outrages upon American citizens and other foreigners h. Mexico
have stirred Texas to the point of intervention by a civilian punitive
force, made up from the determined men of the mining-camps who
can be assembled here.
A plan has been evolved by .the leaders of the movement to
form a regiment of a thousand mining-men, arm and equip them
for a stay in the field, and enter Mexico with'the avowed purpose
of capturing the bandits responsible for the massacre of eighteen
Americans at Chihuahua on Tuesday.
An unconfirmed report reached here today that ten Americans
and two English women had been slain at Madera by a lawless bahd
calling themselves Villistas. One of the two English women re
ported killed is the wife of Captain John Left bridge, a retired Eng;
lish army officer living at Madera. '-
Members of the party conveying the remains of the mining-men
killed Tuesday now fear that two others, who are unaccounted for,
have also .fallen victim to the reckless and murderous robbers who
freely infest the region. The two missing men are Frank Woods
and Ben Snell, who are known to have been near the scene of the
massacre. They have not been heard from since it took place.
General Salazar, who has been identified with various Mexican
factions, and who has been residing here, has fled from Texas to
Juarez. The feeling against the Mexicans is growing so that he
doubted his safety in El Paso.
Texas
Citizens
Want
Use Influence to Secure Action
EL PASO, Texas, Jan. 13. Public sentiment against further de
lay in securing prompt retribution for the killing of Americans in
Mexico has grown so high here that a petition is being circulated
asking that Col. Roosevelt use his influence with Congress to "change
the policy; of the government which' has heretofore refused to exer
cise its paternal duty to protect American life and property abroad."
Persons with property interests in Mexico are not being allowed
to sign the petition. It is aimed to make it clear that the document -is
a prbtest-against lack of action in punishing those who have taken
American 0fe across the border and ruthlessly destroyed property,
but that it .has-no basis in financial interest.
' A report which reached EI Paso today is that Americans in Chi
huahua are fighting against the band led by Gen. Jose Roderigues,
who was reported in command of the Villistas who killed the mining
men on Tuesday. It is reported that numbers of the Roderigues
men have been killed 'and that the Americans are calling for help,
fearing that they will be massacred by superior numbers....
Another report is that Roderigues has been captured by a force
which included-125 Americans and which was led by Maximiliano
Marquez, "an employe ofjhe Hearst raneh interests at Uabricora;
This force, together with a few Carranza soldiers, ia said to be try
ing to f keep order at Madera. Roderigues and his men, .it is
rumored, Kiet the defenders at Madera in a pitched battle.
