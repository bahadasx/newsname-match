(A Weekly Review
Of The Great War
After the conquest of Serbia
the Anglo-French troops retreated
southward^ into Greece and
the Serl>3 westward into Albania.
It. was the expectation of
the Allies at Salonica that the
Au8tro-German and Buigaiian
troops would follow them into
Greece and accordingly they began
to entrench themselves with
^feverish haste and to rush in all
' (? ailable icinforcements. Since
Salonica was at first unfortified
and the French and British
around Salouica did not number
more than a third of what could
have been brought against them,
it seems likely that tbey could
have been overcome if the Ausf
rAal-lAt (nan u ^ lji.1 i.A -io .? ^ ?
VI v/ vic-i mail anvi inn^ai inn ttuups
had continued their advance.
But they stopped instead at the
Greek border. Whether for the
purpose of preparation, or because
their real interest lie elsewhere
regains to be seen. At
any rate, their delay has given
the Allies time to encircle ISalonica
with fortifications, to
bring up 1200 guns and to accumulate
troops to the number
of some 250,000
General Oastelnau, the French
Ohief of Stall, who has visited
Salonica, pronounces it impiegnable
and suys his only fear is
W/ lest the enemy should decide
not to attack but stay where
they are, which, "in view of our
preparation" to receive them fit- <
tingly, woulo be a pity." The
only sign of hostility against Salonica
manifested so tar is the
appearance of severul German
? ' aeroplanes flying high over the
city. One of the Taubes, apparently
mistaking a flock of 1
sheep for the Britisl: army, dropt i
a bomb which kilied shepherd <
an 1 four of his sheep.
On the suspicion that they
were giving information about
the defenses, the Austrian, Ger
man and Turkish consuls at Suloniea
hnve been arrested and
transporteri by order of General
Sarvail, ihe French commander
The prpers of the consulates
wt-re seiz-'d and the consuls with
their families and servants, sixtytwo
altogether, put on board
a French vessel for transport*
tion to pa.ts unknown. The
Bulgarian consul escaped. The
Greek Government has protest
ed against. this new violation of
Greek neutrality bv the Allies.
On the western side of Serbia
there is more activity. The
Austrian?, who invaded Montenegro
from the Sunjtk of NoviLuzrr.
have been driven back
over the frontier into Serbia
with a loss of over 2000 it. killed .
4
and wounded. The Austrian at- |
tack upon the other sido of Mon- j
tenegro, though supported by a (
vigorous aitillery tire from the ,
forts ami tleet, was also ineffective.
The Austrian official r- .
ports are non-committal in re- ,
gard to the fighting in t liin field. <
It seems that the Austrians (
are trying to gain entrance into
northern Albannia by way of !
Dalmatia to the west of Monte- (
negro. The Austrian territory
extends down along the Adriatic
coast nearly to Antivari,
the sole Montenegrin port, and
this is only fifty miles from Scutari,
the chief town of northern '
Albania, now the headquarters |
"trrf'1! of the Serbian Government audi
I?i the rallying point of its scatter
Ky/fK?d troops.
! It in said that the Serbian sol1
diers which have been collected
|'*f and reorganized in Albania nuui
I JGfe ber abjiit 80,000. Tney aro be
mlm[ irg supplied with food and amA
munition by the Italians, who
:$ hold the ports of Durazzo and,
Avlona on the Albanian coaH.
H A squadron of live Austrian de-:
H stroyers from Cattaro entered j
H the harbor of Durazzo and sunk '
Iff two-yesaels there but one of the
B destroyers struck a mine and an*
H other was sunk by shell fire.
The Italian authorities have cxpolled
from Durazzo William
HE W. Howard, of New York, secre|H
ury of the Albanian iieliefj
Fund, and other Americans who j
were engaged in the succor of
the starving Albanians and Serbian
refugees. The 130,000 Austrian
prisoners which the Serbian
troops managed to take t
with them into Albania when 8
they were driven out of Serbia, ii
have been turned over to Italy (J
and are now inteied in Sardinia.
The peak of Hartmanns-Weil- t
erk< pf which figures so protnin- 1
ently in the despatches from d
time to time stands 011 the s
southeastern verge of the Vos- a
ges mountains, overlooking the C
Rhine valley. From its. name ii
one would presume it to be Ger- d
man, but whether it is now in
German hads or French cannot <1
yet be told, for Par's and Berlin p
during the past fortnight have V
been claiming alternate or sim g
nltaneous victories. The crest s<
of the peak, over 3000 feet abovt
sea-level, was cuptured by the if
French lust April, or at least tl
they gained a lodgement there, si
for the Germans still held part w
of the summit. The opposing o<
trenches were in fact only a few
yards apart and 6harp-shooting w
has been incessant between h
them. Ik
On December 21 the French M
took the oll'ensive and drove the pi
Germans from their trenches on n
the summit and the southeastern tl
slope. The Germaiis came back n
on the following day and regain- hi
ed most of their lost positions, tl
This 6ee-saw contlict continued ai
all through Christmas week, butjw
on the whole it aDnears that the! si
French are gaining ground and;
are now in possession of tlie ai
slope of Ilartinanns-Wcilerkopf di
as well as the valley lying be pi
twien this peak and the lesser st
elevation of Ilirzeustein, a mile fe
to the southeast. Whether this a\
attack portends another attempt
,f the French at the conquest of tl
Alsace remains to be seen. Si
During the past week The itus- S'
dans have taken the offensive 111

Pellagra Fight is
Urgent Need
Pellagra has become such a
menace in the South that Secretary
MoA'loo has asked congress
for a rush appropriation of $100,000
for studies and demonstrafl

with a particular view to check
ing that disease and typoid fev
er. He submitted a report from
the public health service which
said:
"Increased demonstrations are
urgently required to prevent pellagra
from becoming a veritable
scourge in many rural com...unities.
In Mississippi alone there
were 10,540 cases and 1,024
deaths l'rom pellagra last year,
and in certain other Sates it has
exceeded tuberculosis as a cause
of death. It is estimated that
there have been approximately
75,000 cases of pellagra throughout
the country this past year,
with more than 7,500 deaths."
The report states that the
country population has not kept
pace with urban communities
along sanitary lines and that lm
proper food has been shown to
have a profound iniluence on the
health of populations and to be
directly responsible for the in
creasing prevalence of pellagra.
