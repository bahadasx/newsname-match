gracefully and sweetly as
she could accept. I think
she ought to if she really

ATTORNEY GENERAL
Lyndon A. Smith Tells United Press
That Definite Steps Are
Fending.
NOT OFFICIALLY ADVISED
OF ILLEGAL LICENSING
Future Action to Depend on Series
of Conferences to Be
Held.
St. Paul, Minn., Jan. 13.With
the Federal government taking the
stand that there is no specific law
to prohibit the sale of liquor in ter
ritory made dry by the Indian treaty,
Attorney General Lyndon A. Smith
today told the United Press that the
situation at Kelliher, where the vil
lage council has issued liquor licen
ses in Indian territory, is compli
cated Definite steps in the situa
tion are pending, he said.
Federal laws, he explained, speci
fically prohibited the introduction of
booze into Indian territory but are
silent regarding its sale. The fact
that a man sold liquor, he said,
might be evidence that he was cog
nizant of its having been introduced
into the territory, and would be
damaging evidence against the man
on a charge of being an accomplice
to a crime.
In the Kelliher situation, the at
torney general said, he had not been
officially advised of any person se
curing a license to sell liquor, hav
ing been convicted of a crime un
der the liquor laws Had any such
person been convicted, it would be
possible, under state laws, he said,
to prosecute city or village council
that issued such a license, for mis
demeanor, and oust them from of
fice.
Any liquor license, he made plain,
does not give a man the right to
break any laws because he holds the
license He admitted the lack of
a precedent in the case, however,
and said that future action must de
pend upon a series of conferences
which liave not been completed. r~

WHITEEARTHINDIANS
Delegation of Red Men Visit Capitol
to Ask for Distribution of
Tribal Fund.
Washington, Jan. 13.Headed by
Gus Beaulieu and J. Fairbanks, a
delegation from the White Earth
reservation is in Washington to pro
test against the appropriation asked
for by the government. With the
delegation are Ed Rogers, "ounty
attorney of Cass county Charles A.
Wakefield, David Bimowain and
Sam Lyons. The committee will ap
pear before the Indian affairs com
mittee of the house.
The department asks for $185,000
for Minnesota. The delegation ob
jects to this on the ground that
many of the salaried positions are
sinecures, and that $60,000 of the
tribal money is wasted annually in
this manner. They also want a
distribution of the tribal funds.
They assert the fund has produced
about $12,000,000, of which $6,-
000,000 has been expended. A de
tailed accounting for the whole is
asked, and a demand made that a
quarter of the funds now in hand De
distributed per capita. This would
amount to about $148 for each In
dian in Minnesota.
