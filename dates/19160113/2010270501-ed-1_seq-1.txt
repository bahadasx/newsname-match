HONESTY IN ALL HEALINGS
t(Frora South Omaha Journal Stock
man, January 1, 1916).
The many patrons of the South
Or aha market have viewed with
amazement the rapid growth made at
tkis point the: last few years, and
have noted with pleasure the many
Improvements at the yards. Very
few of them realize the organization
necessary to keep a big business en
terprise of this character moving
along in the right channels no as to
best promote the live stock Industry
In this territory.
For the purpose of explaining the
term "live stock interests" as applied
to those doing business at the Union
Stock Yards at South Omaha, it may
be said that it covers five separate
and distinct bodies of men; the pack
ers, the railroads, .the banks, the
Traders' Exchange (yard traders),
and the Live Stock Exchange (com
mission men and traders). Each has
Its own organization and its separate
sphere of usefulness, and all work to
gether towards upbuilding the mar
keted the live stock industry in the
West.
The formation of Live Stock Ex
changes t.the different market cen
ter was made necessary at an early
4a? by reason of the crude and eha
tlc condition of business affairs
shortly after some of the larger mar
kets were opened. At that time
there was no organization-to take
charge of the system of trading to
see that market conditions were fair
to all concerned, and to see that bus
iness was conducted la an honest and
upright manner. To their credit It
can be said that live stock exchanges
hare grown In size and usefulness as
the live stock industry has grown In
prominence and as the different mar
kets have Increased their receipts.
The South Omaha Live Stock Ex
change Is a voluntary association. '
composed of men doing a live stock
business at the Union Stock Yards in
South Omaha, and on December 1,
1916. comDrised about 248 members,
The objects of this association are .
to establish and maintain a commer-
cial exchange. Not for pecuniary'
gain or proit, but to promote and
protect all interests concerned in the
purchase and sale of live stock at the
South Omaha Stock Yards; to pro-
mote uniformity In the customs and
nsages at said market; to Inculcate
ami in sum correct and hign moral
principles In the transaction of busi
ness; to Inspire confidence in the
methods and integrity of its mem
bers; to provide facilities for the or
derly and prompt conduct of busi
ness; to facilitate the speedy and
equitable adjustment of disputes; i
generally.
to promote the welfare ol 1
the South Omaha market.
The government of the Exchange
is vested in a board cf nii.o directors,
three of whom are elected euch year
for a term of three years, a president
and a vice president, who are elected
annually for one year. This board of
directors Is the executive body of the
Exchange. They have general sup
ervision of the affairs of the Ex
change a..d are aided and assisted in
their work by the following commit

HOW THE STOCK
SHOW WAS BORN
Bit of lli-tory from The Denver Roc-ortl-Stoekmaii
that Will Inter
ewt Nebraska Ranclinien
IIIOCKIC THAN EVER THIS YEAR
It was a little over sixteen years
ago that the first event which led to
the final building of what is now
known as "The National Western
Stock Show" took place. In the fall
of 1898 some of the stockmen who
lived around Denver decided that, as
the National Live Stock Association
was to hold its second annaal meet
ing in Denver, that there should be
some kind of an exhibition of live
stock, and, accordingly, committees
..were appointed and plans were
made for "The National Exhibition of
Range Cattle." and on January 24,
25, 26 and 27, 1899. this first stock
show was pulled off at the Denver
Union Stock Yards. The show con
sisted entirely of feeder cattle in
carloads, and some 35 loads of very
good oattle, as cattle ran in those
days, were on exhibition, and all
kinds of premiams were contributed
by Denver merchants and others, to
gether with some special silver med
als, which were awarded to the lucky
exhibitors. It was a small show In
a way, but it attracted a great deal
of
attention, and the competition
among the rangemen who exhibited
was keen.
There was a great deal of talk
about this
first show, and the ques-
tion was asked a number of timet, '
"Why don't you do it again? So in ;
1905, when Hon. E. M. Amnions be- i
came president of the Colorado Cat-;
tie Growers' Association, he made a
strong plea for the establishment of
another stock show, and daring the
summer and fall the matter was tak-
en up by officers of the association.
committees were appointed, tne nat
was passed for subscriptions, and in
January, 1906, the "Denver Fat
Stock and Feeder Show" was held.
. It is doubtful if very many realiz
ed at that time that this was the
real beginning of a series of great
live stock exhibitions to be held in
Denver. The premium list, as In the
cate of the first show, was devoted
very largely to carloads of feeder cat
tle, with some provisions made for
inuividual fat steers. A tent was

sheep and hogs practically forced
their way into the exhibition. There
were no entrance fees or admission
charges, but thousands of stockmen,
mostly from Colorado, with a few
from outside the state, spent days ex
amining the cattle exhibited, and the
event met with such enthusiasm that
even before this show had ended it
had been determined to at once per
fect an organization and proceed to
hold a regular annual show.
Within a very few weeks after thin
first successful Bhow several meeting.-;
were held, and it was decided to in
corporate the Western Stock Show
Association. L. F. Twitchell, thi
well-known Denver attorney, was en
gaged to draw a charter, and on
March 10, 1906, the charter was filed
with the secretary of stale. The char
ier members of the association were
the following: E. M. Amnions. F. W.
Hoot. Clyde II. Stevens, W. L. Car
lyle, Jose P. Adams, Fred P. John
son, William M. Springer, Harry Pet
rie, L. F. Twitchell, A. J. Campion,
John II. Fesler, C. E. Stubbs, J. F.
Vallery, E. Bosserman. Gordon
Jones, John Grattan and I. N. Mob
erly. Plans were immediately cor.r.v.cno
ed for the second bhow. At that
lime the property owned by the Hock
yards company south ot the railroad
trark was simply a barren hill cov
ered with weeds. . The stock yards
company decided to put a two-story
Judging Cattle in the Arena
brick barn on this land, and early in
the summer the hill was graded
down, and the first building which
now forms a part of the group of
buildings which annually care for
this great show was constructed.
Col. W. E. Skinner, who as gener
al manager of the Chicago Internat
ional show had made that institution
a great success, about this time came
to Denver, and he was engaged to
act as general manager for the next
show. A monster tent was ordered
constructed especially for the event,
and the second show was pulled off
during the third week in January.
It happened this year that, while
the weather was fine, there was an
unusual amount of high winds, and
the week before the show, when the
new monster tent was erected, a par
ticularly heavy gust of wind blew it
down, causing a number of bad rents
in the fabric. Workmen were at
once engaged, repairs were ma at,
and the tent was again erected in
time for the show. The new brisk
barn and the big tent were used to
hold the exhibits of individual
breeding animals, and the
carloads

were placed in the pens in the stock future responsibility of the show as
yards, as before. The second show sociatlon in their agreement to hold
was an even greater success than the thif show at th Denver I'nion Stock
first, and upon its conclusion imme- Yards for at least ten years.
j diate steps were taken to make the
' third show even larger.
For the third show the stork yard?
company erected a large fhed for
stabling the cattle and built an open
frame stadium, enclosing a largn
amphitheatre, and over this was
placed the top of the big tent in
which the second show had been
held.
Whil the tirftt and second chowe
had been successful, the third show
was an event. For the first ti .e an
admission fee was charged, and for a
solid week stockmen, farmers
citizens of Denver crowded to
and
the
stock yards. All of the big cattle
breeds were represented, as well as
hogs, sheep and horses, and the Gen
tlemen's Driving and Riding Club of
Denver conducted the first horse
show, which was successfully pulled
o.T in the stadium amphitheatre, not
withstanding the fact that high
winds prevailed during a large part

of the week and made some of the
entertainment in the ring more ex
citing than could be desired because
of the constant flapping of the big
canvas which covered it.
Those who had been working so
hard ;ach year to establish this show
now decided that they had fully dem
onstrated the necessity for such an
Institution at Denver, and strong
pressure was brought to bear upon
the stock yards interests to construct
such suitable buildings as were really
necessary to make this annual mid
winter exhibition more f'comfortableN
Negotiations with the stock yards
company resulted In an agreement
that if the show association would
agree to put up a guarantee fund to
warrant the continuance of the show
for at least ten years the company
would erect an amphitheatre suffici
ent for the requirements of the ex
position. This was promptly agreed
to by the show association, and
committees Immediately began work
to sell memberships In the associa
tion at 1100 each, and thus approxi-
andlmately $25,000 was realized and was
put
up as a cash guarantee as to the

first time the association was able
to hold night shows at which the fine
horses from all over the United
States were exhibited In harness.

the fifth show the two upper floors
of the new building were used for
cattle and the bottom flor for hors
es. From that time on there has been
a steady development In the annual
exhibition. The feed and forage ex
hibit which was added at the fourth
show developed Into a great agricul
tural exhibit. At the sixth show the
poultrymen came Into their own with
a National Western Toultry Show,
and at the ninth show dairy cattle
made their first appearance, togeth
er with a baby health contest, and
the show -had become a great mid
winter fair.
The outbreak of foot and mouth
contagion In the East prevented the
holding of the tenth show In Janu
ary, 1915, but the citizens of Denver
were bo determined that some kind
of an exhibition should be held that,
after the show association had aban
doned the exhibition, with the aid of
the Gentlemen's Driving and Riding
Club of Denver, the horse show and
poultry show was successfully con-

stock show should have been held.
Only those who have closely watch-
ej toe progress of this Institution

has accomplished. The live stock
which were received with enthusiasm
at the first show in 1906, at the com

given room to exhibit, po great has

WILL INTEREST ALL RANCHMEN
An article will appear soon in Tho
Nebraska Stockman and the monthly
stockmen's edition of The Alllanco
Herald that should be read by every
Nebraska ranchman and everybody
else interested in brands in this state.
It will be a comparison of the brand
laws of Nebraska and Colorado, and
a concise explanation of the practic
al operation of brand Inspection un
der the laws of the two states.
Drand Inspection In Nebraska is a
splendid thing for those who receive
the benefit of it. but there are many
ranchmen in this state, even among
those who have their brands record
ed, who are not protected by inspec
tion as now carried on, and there are
frequent complaints about the brand
laws of this state as they now stand.
On the other hand, Colorado
ranchmen are enthusiastic over their
brand laws and their practical oper
ation. They claim to have the best
brand laws In existence and that
shipping stolen cattle has been elim
inated, except along the borders of
the state where they are driven
across the line to load, and that
eases of that kln they usually -h
the thief. In the opinion of the sec
retary of the state board of stock In
spection commisskoners, who Is on
of the oldest ranchmen In that state,
If surrounding slates had the same
kind of brand laws that Colorado has,
it would be Impossible for a thief to
teal more cattle than he could eat,
and even that might be a difficult
thing for him to do.
Altho the latent brand laws of Ne
braska have teen published In this
paper, no comparison of the kind
above indicated has ever been print
ed yet. IT WILL BD INTEREST
