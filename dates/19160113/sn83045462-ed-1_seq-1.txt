EL PASO, Tex., January 13.?
A report was current in Chihuahua
that ten American men and
two English women had been
killed by Villa troops at Madera.
Chihuahua, according to Americans
who arrived here early today
with the bodies of the eighteen
Americans who were killed
last Monday.
Late today the Madera telegraph
operator reported there was
ni> truth in the report.
A rumor also was circulated that three
Americans had been murdered in the
Canawea district of Sonont, in the vicinity
of the Phelps-Dodge property. It
could not be verified.
Bodies of Victims Arrive.
The bodies of eighteen Americans
killed Monday by Mexican bandits near
Santa Ysabel, western Chihuahua,
reached El Paso early today and were
taken in charge by undertakers preparatory
to sending them to relatives
in various parts of the countr3*.
The body of Joseph Enders. reported
to have been killed, was not among
those arriving today.
P. E. Stephenson, secretary of the
Mining and Smeltermen's Association
of Chihuahua, who organized the party j
that recovered the bodies, said that
tne heads were almost blown off.
Found Bandits in Camp.
They were stripped of betore
being dragged out of the cars and |
killed," said Stephenson. "When we I
arrived at the scene of the massacre a
Carranza guard remained at Santa Ysa- |
he!, wjiere we found a number of the
bandit^ encamped. We returned to the j
troop train to get a machine gun, and |
then proceeded to the place where the
bodies were heaped."
An expedition which left Chihuahua j
City to recover the bodies of the nineteen
slain Americans were informed by
the station agent a: Santa Ysabel that'
Benjamin Snell and Frank Woods passed
there, bound west, half an hour after
the Watson train was reported in trouble.
The station agent said he warned
ine two men 10 return, DUt they said
they were armed and feared no trouble.
Nothing later was heard of the party
and it is believed that they met the
ate of the Watson train.
Led by Villa Generals.
Pablo Kopez. .t Yaqui chief, and Gen.
Uevna. two Villa generals, led the men
v ho assassinated the group of Amerin
miners, and the massacre was comi
itted Hose in the wake of a Carranza
i oop train, according to information of
'he affair gathered here. Statements
made by J. Guadelupe Gartieua, conductor
of the train bearing the Americans.
and Thomas B. Holmes, the only
known survivor of the American
party, indicate that the murder of the
I'nited States citizens was deliberate.
Conductor Gardena, in an affidavit i
given to the British consul at Chihuahua,
said that the train bearing the
Americans was stopped by a derailed
train in a cut. This train is said to
.have been part of the equipment bearing
Carranza troops
The conductor said that Gen. Reyna
"held the trainmen under guard while i
the Americans were robbed and shot ,
to death. Those who were wounded in
the first fusillade were later shot dead.
A score of Mexican armed men at - }
tacked the train which was bea ring the i

were some 200 other bandits grouped j
as a reserve force along the right of j

Representative
Slayden Says Time j
Has Come for Pan-America to
Take a Hand.
!
Representative Slayden of Texas I
delivered an impassioned address
on the floor of the Mouse of Representatives
today, in which he
suggested the possibility of American
citizens on the Mexican border
taking the law into their own
hands because of the slaying by
Mexican bandits of citizens of the
United States.
In the Senate the sending of
j armed forces of the United States
into Mexico to protect American
citizens and their property was
urged under a resolution introduced
by Senator Lewis of Illinois.

Representative Slayden in the ]
House declared that the time has j
come tor pan-American action toi
bring peace in Mexico, and in- i <
sisted that only the execution of
the murderers of the seventeen i
Americans who were slain there
Monday, near Chihuahua City,
would satisfy the people of the
border states.
Lewis Besolution on Table.
The Lewis resolution, which was allowed
to lie on the table for the time
being-. Senator Lewis giving; notice that
he intends to perfect it, is as follows:
[ "That the President of the United
'States be authorized and empowered
to order the army of the United States,
or any necessary part thereof, to the
country of Mexico, and to there cooperate
with any force there existing,
which, to the President, shall seem appropriate
for the object of protecting
the citizens and property of the United
States, and to punish those violating
the security of the United States
I citizens, and to authorize the President
to use the military and naval forces of
the United States in Mexico to the <
I j'ame extent as now by law permitted
i the navy in Nicaragua and Haiti for
I the protection of American rights."
! Had Heard an "Ugly Story/'
J In his speech in the House Representative
Slayden said he has heard an
"ugly story" in connection with the
crime of Monday, to the effect that the
Americans, who relied on the Carranza
government for protection, had asked
for and had been refused a military es
?cort by/the Carranza officials. He said, j
in part: .
"The President did the proper and (
only possible thing in adopting: the j (

Rupprecht of Bavaria Says That

N Greatest Foe.
BKRL.IX. January 13, by wireless to
Sayvllle, N. Y.?The Lokal Anzeiger, according
to the Overseas News Agency,
publishes an interview with Prince
Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria.
The prince is quoted as saying regarding
his troops:
"I wish to say and repeat that with
these troops all tilings can be attained.
Nothing is too much for them, nothing
too hard. Behind them are heavy days
and they are now in the midst of heavy
days. Our worst enemy is not th? foe,
but the weather and water. But they
must almost master this, as they have
mastered everything.
British Push Diminishes.
"As for the British soldiers, they are
no longer what they were. We see
every day that their push is diminishing.
Their lack of officers has caused
a decrease in their fighting power."
The prince had spok^jt-about his own
troops, says the interviewer, with his
blue eves radiant and nis race resplendent
with deep joy.
Questioned about the probable consequences
of compulsory military service
in England. the crown prince said:
"That will not change anything. Many
months must pass until those men are
even half way trained for war; that is,
supposing that a force capable of
training them exists, and they will
never be first rate troops. Time is
not merely an ally for our adversaries,
it is an ally also for us."
Praises Women at Home.
Regarding the attitude of the women
at home the crown prince is quoted as
saying that the wives of the soldiers
at the front are8 acting splendidly.
"I have never heard from the boys,"
he said, "that their wives cause their
hegds or their hearts to become heavy.
The wives are glad to be able to showthat
they are bearing on their shoulders
part of the burden which their
sons and husbands have to bear."
^The crown prince sent greetings to
those at home, saying:
"Tell them we are all right, and tell
them that our incomparable troops will
obtain everything necessary for Germany's
prosperity."

Admiral Stanford Says It Cannot

TELLS COMMITTEE WHY
$600,000 MORE IS NEEDED
Answers Questions of Members Concerning
Capacity and Usefulness
of Washington Navy Yard.
( One angle of the national prepared;
ness question touches in a vital sgiot
ion the Washington navy yard, according
to Admiral Stanford of the bureau
of yards and docks, who appeared before
thp ;naval affairs committee of the
House today, and that is the tact'that
the gun shop at the yard is entirely
inadequate to furnish all the guns that
the present program demands.
For that reasop the admiral explained
the necessity for the" proposed $600,000
increase at the Washington gun shop,
although Admiral Strauss of the bureau
of ordnance probably will, be asked
many questions on the technical matters,
involved. J
The term "entirely inadequate" is the
expression of Admiral Stanford him- |
self. Tn reply to questions from Chair- j
man* Padgett he said that ins bureau
proposed a steel-frame building, with |
brick walls, or perhaps concrete and 1
brick. lie said it would laice eignieenj,
months perhaps to build the new addi- I
tion, figuring 011 the present state of I
tiie structural steel industry and the
possible delays in delivery. j
Gunshop Is Inadequate.
Representative Buchanan asked whether
the gunshop is being used to its full capacity.
*
"I can only answer that by stating
that those in command of the yard declare
that the gunshop is totally inadequate,
and the need for an addition
is pressing."
Representative Calloway brought out
the .fact that the gunshop makes the .
big guns for dreadnaughts, and then
asked the annual question as to whether
trie Washington yard is so near the
coast that it could be captured by an j
enemy "before breakfast." in accord- '
a nee with the views of many speculative
writers on war subjects, Admiral 1
Stanford referred him to the strategists 3
of the navy.
"The extension will be about 600 by
200 feet," said Admiral Stanford, ques- *
tioned further, "and will be in the form
of an Jj, which will take in several old .
buildings."
Need for New Buildings.
Representative Butler of Pennsyl- ]
vanfa referred with a little heat in his \
voice to the fact that the naval affairs '
j committed "builds up one year and de- 1
i stroys those buildings another year." 1
! "Can you not," he asked, "use those '
j old buildings which will have to be 1
torn down for this new addition?" <
"I use the judgment of those in command
of the yard," answered Admiral
Stanford. <
He also explained the necessity for a <
sixty-five-thousand-dollar storage plant 1
for the valuable models which are used i
for experiment purposes in the model <

basin. For fuel oil storage the estimates
ask $18,000. Admiral Stanford
said that at present this oil is stored
in old boilers, and that only two and a
half weeks' supply could be maintained
in the yard under present conditions.
The oil is used for heating some of the
gun pits and is a necessary detail, which
would be tied up in case of a railroad
delay. At the end of the Washington
navy yard items the committee took up
Norfolk navy yard and dry dock needs.

! POLICE CHIEF TELLS
i ABOUT CONFESSIONS
Gives Details of Alleged Stories
of Dr. Mohr's
Murder.
DECLARES DEFENDANTS
ADMITTED THE CRIME
Says Wife of Physician Wrote
Threatening Letter to a Brother
of Miss Burger.
PROVIDENCE. R. T.. January in ?
Further testimony bearing on the
charge by the prosecution that Cecil
V. Brown and Henry H. Spellman, negroes
on trial for the murder of Dr. C.
Franklin Mohr, August 31, had made
statements admitting their part in the
crime and implicating Mrs. Elisabeth
F. Mohr, the physician's widow, was
presented today. Mrs. Mohr, a joint
defendant, is charged with having instigated
the murder. The court 1 tiled
yesterday that these alleged confessions
were inadmissible, but must be
disregarded so far as they e<fncerned
Mrs. Mohr.
William F. O'Neil, chief inspector of
the Providence police, who testified that
tlie alleged statements were mad? voluntarily,
was recalled today. He testified
that Brown and Spellman made
certain admissions to him, but that the
latter first denied all knowledge of the
crime. After being confronted by
George H. Healis, Dr. Mohr's chauf
feur, who stated that Spell man had
arranged with him to stop the physician's
car on the road, Spellman, according
to the witness, finally confessed.
Healis has since turned state's
evidence.
Alleged Price for Murder.
"I asked Spellman why he shot at
Miss Burger and why Brown fired at
Dr. Mohr," O'Xeil said, "and he said he
did it because Mrs. Mohr wanted it;
done and that she promised td give
$5,000 to have it done. Brown told me
he was to get $2,000, Healis $2,000 and
Spellman $1,000. 1 then had Mrs. Mohr
arrested."
Healis' confession was excluded on
objection by the defense.
When Mrs. Mohr was brought before
him. O'Xeil said, she made some response
to Healis' confession, but her
statement was excluded because it was
not shown that it was of an incriminating
nature.
Chief O'Xeil said he showed Mrs.
Mohr a card received by George Rooks,
brother-in-law of Emily G. Burger,
which the defendant admitted having
written a year before.
In the card which was read to the
jury Mrs. Mohr asked Rooks to tell
Miss Burger that "if she dares ever to
go into my Newport home Again she
will never come out alive. 1 give her
fair warning. She will have a sad ending
if she keeps on aggravating me.
The world is with me in my
sorrow. 1 am heartbroken."
When questioned in detail concerning
Brown's confession. O'Xeil said:
"Brown told ine that Mrs. Mohr sent
for him on the night of August 30 and
told him to prepare to kill the doctor?
that she could stand it no longer. He
said Mrs. Mohr told him there was
something in it for hint?that she
would put him in the garage to work
and not to be afraid, as she stood in
with the detectives in Newport and the
judges in Provitf^jgce and that it would
all blow over in a couple of days. He
said that Mrs. Mohr had directed him
a month before to go to Boston and
purchase a revolver. Brown stated
that he did so and that Mrs. Mohr said
that if he didn't kill the doctor she
would do it herself. He also said Mrs.
Mohr gave him $100 to buy a motor
cycle."
Admission of the Confessions.
The admission of the alleged confessions
by the two negro defendants and
the exclusion of evidence concerning
the character Vf the medical practice
of Dr. C. Franklin Mohr were the most
interesting developments at yesterday's
session. N
By the latter ruling the court robbed
the easy of much of its popular interest,
as counsel for the defense had intimated
that sensational revelations
! might be expected.
j The alleged confessions of the neI
groes that they were employed by Mrs.
| Mohr to murder her husband were later
I repudiated except in the case of a
! third negro, George W. Healis. who
I turned state's evidence. While the
court decided to let the "confessions"
go in, he stated that the jury would be |
instructed to disregard them in considering
the feuilt or innocence of Mrs. '
Mohr. Counsel fought strenuously to 1

the statements were made by Brown

Questions put to Miss Emily G. Burger,
secretary, and at times house- !
keeper for the late Dr. Mohr. in crossexamination
by William H. Eewis,
counsel for the negroes, foreshadowed
in a measure what the defense of
Brown and Spellman would probably
be. Miss Burger was in an automobile
with the doctor on the night he was
shot, and received two bullet wounds
herself.
Admitting she was closely acquainted
with Dr. Mohr's business affairs, she
was asked by Mr. I.e wis what he
specialized in, if anything. The prosecuting
attorney was instantly on his
reel wmi an uujcviui..
Nature of His Practice.
"Were his patients mostly women
or ?" began Mr. Lewis, when the
state again objected^
"What is the materiality of this
question." inquired the court.
"We want to show that some one
else besides these defendants may have
I had a motive for having the doctor out
of the way." answered Mr. Lewis.
I Judge Stearns excluded this line of
I inquiry, and the character of the doctor's
practice was not revealed by Miss
Burger.
Miss Burger in her story to the Jury,
told for the first time publicly, stated
that she was very friendly with Dr.
Molir, that she had visited several
hotels with him, had gone with him to
Boston on shopping trips, and had
walked along the beach at Newport
with him Sunday afternoons.
During Miss Burger's recital, Mrs.
Mohr sat stiffly, watching the witness
intently at times, but betraying no
feeling except that her cheeks were
pale.

To Evacuate Cettinje.
In view of the success of the Austrian
offensive against Mount Lovcen, measures
have been taken by the Montenegrin
government to evacuate Cettinje
immediately, according to a Scutari
dispatch. says the Petit Journal's
Milan correspondent. The government,
however, has decided to continue the
struggle against the Austrians. the
dispatch adds.
Grave Menace to Italy.
HOME. January 13.?The capture of
Mount Lovcen, Montenegro, by the
Austrians is regarded here as presenting
a grave menace for Italy. Militar>
critics point out that Austria thereby
gains domination of the Adriatic coast
and, furthermore, will be able to invade
northern Albania.
Italian newspapers appeal to the allies
for immediate intervention to
spare Montenegro from the fate of Serbia.
King Nicholas of Montenegro is
i quoted as saying :
"Lovcen is the Olympus of our race,
(the cradle of the dynasty, the strong
! hold which resisted the invasion of the
! Turks, even when they reached the
| walls of Vienna. Lovcen is more precious
than if it were a colossal diamond."
Fate Is in Balance.
"On Montenegro weighs the fate
of Belgium and Serbia," says Mes$a
c"The taking of Lovcen by A us
tria means the taking: of Cettinje.
Those who direct the operations of the
entente allies say that the sacrifice is
small and state that it is an insignifican
episode in a gigantic struggle.
But it Is possible to go too far in this
point of view.
I "In 1900 the Zanardelli cabinet, understanding
the importance of Lovcen
[ for Italy, sent to Montenegro four
I cannon of large caliber to defend it.
but Austria protested and thus a further
expedition of arms was suspended.
In the summer of 1914, when the
Anglo-French fleet began its campaign
inrthe Adriatic, it would have been easy
to' help Montenegro if Cattaro were
properly bombarded from Lovcen. The
Austrian fleet would have been bottled
up at Cattaro and obliged to put to
sea like that of Admiral Cervera at
Santiago.
"Today. instead. besides Cettinje.
Scutari also is in danger of falling to
the Austrians."
A correspondent telegraphing from
Scutari says that the Montenegrins,
aided by Serbian contingents, are making
a stout resistance to the Austrians
although outnumbered five to one
Scutari Situation Desperate.
PARIS, January 13.?A Scutari t<?]eto
the Serbian legation in Rome
describes the situation in Scutari as
approaching: desperation. Food i ;
lacking to feed thousands of women,
children and refugees from Serbia, the f
latter arriving in large numbers,
swelling the refugee colony already
established.
The new arrivals, adds the message,
are obliged to sleep in the open air
in the bitter cold. It declares that
hundreds are dying daily in the streets
of cold and hunger, and that nearly all
the very young children have died
from lack of nourishment.
