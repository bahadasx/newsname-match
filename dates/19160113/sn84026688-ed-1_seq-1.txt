American Ambulance Drivers Give
Vivid Description of Scenes They
Witnessed in Land Whsi'.
Death Is Common.
These vivid sketches of tattle scr?-is
are given In letters written by Kj-.b
ard Norton and VV. R. Berry, who ire
attached to the American Volunteer
Motor Ambulance corps, which bri
dled 6,000 wounded men In the five
days of the main allied drive i.n
Franco last September. The lettf.’S
were received by Eliot Norton, ot 2
Rector street, this city. Richard Nor
ton writes:
"Still another picture that rises In
my mind as 1 write is of one cloudy
morning when, after a very tiring
night. 1 was sitting on the roads’, le
watching a rather heavy bombardment
near by, and suddenly through the din
rose the sweet cleur notes ot a shep
herd s pipe. It was the same read
pipe ( have heard so often on the hills
of Greece and Asia Minor, and the
same sweetly sad, age-old shepherd
music telling of Pan and the nymphs
and the asphodel meadows where
Youth lies buried. The piper was an
ordinary plou-piou, a simple fantas n,
'tnon vieux Charles’ with knapsack on
back, rifle slung over his shoulder,
and helmet on head strolling down to
the valley of death a few hundred
yards beyond.”
Mr. Berry pictures the stream of
wounded.
"One last scene I shall not forget,"
he says, "There was a white chalk
road between black pipe trees, on
It, moving towards us, were (wo
groups of shuffling men, a blood-red
sunset ?t their backs. Our car slowed
down to pass between them, but
when we saw, we stopped—and let
them pass.
"On one side moved a muddy, blood
stained company, where blue-clad fig
ures drooped in saddles, or clung with
both hands to a comrade’s stirrup
leather. I saw a broken sword and
empty carbine holsters, and I saw, too,
eyes glazed with fatigue that stared
from dead-white faces. On the other
passed a second company, muddy
and blood-stained like the first, but
there were gray-clad figures stagger
ing in stop, the stronger with their
arms around their comrades. 1 saw
the ribbon of the iron cross, and I
saw again eyes glazed with fatigue
that stared from dead-white faces.
“So passed us by a remnant of the
Hussars' charge, and a group of Ger
man prisoners Victors and van
quished—with only the white road be
tween them.” —New Y’ork Evening
Post.
Foreign Children Are Healthier.
The death rate among children born
in New York city of native American
parents is higher than among children
of foreign parents, according to a re
port by Dr. William H. Ouilfoy, regis
trar of the health department. Chil
dren of native white parents, the re
port says, die at the rate of 14 males
and 35 females out of every 1,000 be
fore attaining the age of five years.
The death rate for native parents,
both white and negro, is 78 males and
65 females. Children of foreign-born
parents show a mortality during the
live years of 39 males and 32 females.
The lowest mortality rate is given by
the records to Russian-born mothers.
The birth rate among foreign-born
mothers is almost three times greater
than among native mothers. —New
York Times.
Those "Shade” Cartoons.
The property room of the cartoonist
is a scone of great activity these
days. Mars, the war god, has been
brought out and dusted, and his face
touched up to look more fearsome
than ever. All the war shades of the
past, have been working overtime, and
death, Frankenstein, Mars and the
devil have been very busy. The shades
ot Wellington, Nelson, Bismarck,
King Edward, Julius Caesar, the vet
erans of 1870, have been taxed to their
utmost, while the portly shade of Na
poleon, through many calls on his serv
ices by tbe world’s cartoonists, has
been worn to a mere shadow. —Car-
toons Magazine.
Even In Germany.
I had been in the country on busi
ness for three days and had not seen
an up-to-date newspaper in all that
time. My anxiety to know how the
war had gone In the meantime was,
as you may imagine, somewhat keen.
My wife was at the station to meet me.
1 rushed up to her. “What news, my
dear?” I cried. "What news?”
“Oh, darling,’’ said she, "what do
you think? Skirts are being worn
shorter than ever.”

I Jim’s
j Decision j
| By H. M. EGBERT j
(Copyright, 1916, by W. Q. Chapman.)
Jim Bennett sat on the sand o|
Tan-tan island and looked out acrosi
the sea, as he had done each day foi
more than a year. Everybody in Tan
tan know Jim Bennett, and the ragged
est beachcomber sneered when bit
name was mentioned. It was not s(
much the depths to which he had fall
cu as the fact that ho had fallen s(
far.
Three years ago he had left San
Francisco to make his fortune in tht
South seas and come back to niurrj
Elsie Dale. But her father was man)
times a millionaire, and had othei
ideas for Elsie's future. Everything
depended, then, on Jim's making good
on the copra trading trip, in which h
had sunk li is little capital.
At least, so fur as marrying Elsie
was concerned. Her father would
never consent. Jim knew Jack Dale
too well to hope for that. But if the
trip succeeded Jim could afford to bear
the old man's enmity, and Elsie had
said she would.
Tim ship was wrecked on an un
charted reef off Tan-tan. Jim saw his
little capital lost. He had barely tha
fare homo. Despair took hold of him,
then the lethargy of the life in the lit
tle place. Ho had sunk down and
down. Ho bud at last written to Elsie
releasing her—and had forgotten.
He had quite forgotten by the time
Elsie's letter arrived. She had told
him that she was going to wait three
years. If at the end of that time ho
" O ?;.■*•
Sat on the Sand of Tan-tan Island.
did not claim her, she would feel
free. But she loved him; let him re
member that every day ot his life.
At the end of the first year Jim re
membered it occasionally. He was
tending bar in one of the island sa
loons. At the end of the second year
he had a hazy recollection. Then he
was doing odd jobs, in his sober mo
ments, along the wharf. At the end of
the third year, when he was nothing
but a beachcomber, lie remembered
again, this time more clearly.
He remembered it when the month
ly vessel arrived. He expected that
it would carry a letter for him. No let
ter hud been at the post ollice; and
yet. when Jim looked up and saw a
young, athletic American, neatly
dressed, with sun he.met and blue
glasses, approaching him, he was sure
that he had come upon business con
cerning Elsie.
Jim looked up lazily from among the
little group of fellow loafers, and won
dered how any man could tiud the
energy to walk at that gait in such a
sun. The young man drew up to the
group and stopped.
“Any ot you men know a fellow
named Jim Bennett?” he inquired.
The man nearest Jim nudged him
lazily; the rest did not even shift their
eyes from the far horizon.
“I’m Jim Bennett,” said Jim, rising.
He saw the astonishment upon the
young man's face.
"Will you please come over here?”
asked the stranger.
He led him about fifty yards away,
out of the hearing of the others. He
might have saved himself the trouble,
for those who were not asleep in the
shade had already forgotten Jim’s ex
istence. When they stood together up
on the sand the young man took Jim
by tbe shoulders and swung him round,
facing him.
"Are you Jim Bennett or are you
lying?” he demanded, in crisp, nervous
accents.
For an instant Jim felt the resent
ment that would have come to any nor
mal man at such treatment; but then
he remembered that he had left his
manhood behind him at the whisky
bar in Tam-tam town,
i . “I'm Jim Bennett,” he answered dog
gedly. "What do you want with me?"
The other breathed hard. "Where
do you come from?" he demanded. “I
must have proofs of what you say.
Who is the woman to whom you are
engaged?”
“You mean Miss Dale, I suppose,”
drawled Jinl, and the other let his
hands drop from bis shoulders and
■tarod at him hopelessly.
A Family Newspaper —Independent in Politics —Devoted to Literature, Local and Gonaral News.
“Are you drunk or sunstruck?” he
inquired presently.
"Usually both,” answered Jim truth
fully. "Today, as it happens, 1 haven’t
found anyone willing to give me the
price. How about, you?”
Tbe youug man clapped him on tha
shoulder.
“Listen to me.” he said quietly. “You
must have been a man once, from all
I’ve heard ot you. 1 recognize you
now from your photograph, although
that beard makes you look quite differ
ent. Miss Dale's father Is dead. He
has left her his whole fortune. She
wanted me to come and find you and
bring you back to her. She loves you,
and pride doesn’t count. She knows
what you must have been through,
and she’s going to ask you to marry
her, once she gets you at her side.
Understand?”
Jim understood. The thought of the
Dale millions at his command was
paralyzing; it galvanized him Into life.
He looked up, to see the young man
reading his face.
"Here’s ten dollars!” he said sud
denly. "No—wait!” He pulled out
the pocketbook again. "Here’s a hun
dred. Do you think you can get
washed and cleaned and have a new
suit and good linen on your back,
ready to sail on the ship tomorrow?”
Jim pocketed the money mechan
ically. “I suppose so,” he muttered.
"What’s your hurry?"
“Because,” said the other gravely,
"Miss Dale is on board. That’s why.
And the best man In the world couldn’t
deserve your luck.”
Somehow the new clothes, the lux
ury of a bath, had put new manhood
into Jim. He lay In bed early in the
morning in the hotel and speculated
what he would do with the Dale mil
lions, Ho would go to San Francisco,
of course. He would build a palace
there. He would have automobiles,
fine clothes, cigars, all the physical
luxuries which he had been denied
so long. And—he would marry Elsie
ot the first opportunity, to keep his
hold on her.
He got up and dressed. He was
just about to leave the room when the
young man entered. He surveyed Jim
with a grimmer smile than before.
‘ You haven't shaved off your beard,”
he said.
“No,” said Jim thoughtfully. "It
looks —more manly. I think.”
The other looked at him in con
tempt. It penetrated the man's skin,
Jim winced. It was the first moment
of self-realization in many a year.
"Why have you done all this (or
me?” he asked, looking at the other
curiously. "Do you know, I believe —
1 believe you are In love with Elsie
yourself."
"Miss Dale from you, please,” re
plied the other. “Y’es, 1 am in love
with her, if you wish to know it. Ana
if I hadn't found yon 1 think she
would have married me."
"Then why did you find me?" mut
tered Jim.
The other choked down an expletive.
"If ypu’re ready," he said coldly,
"we’ll start right away."
Jim went out with him. And now,
surveyed by the curious inhabitants
of the little settlement, the target of
their sneering glances, Jim felt sud
denly more ashamed than he had ever
felt before in all his life. And (or
the first time he really understood the
depths of his degradation.
He had been a worthless beach
comber, while she had waited for him,
believed in him. He was utterly worth
less. He could not degrade that pure
life to the level of his own. He had
thought of nothing but the Dale mil
lions, nothing at all of the love that
had been true to him.
Unconsciously he held his head
higher and flung back the scornful
gestures, the looks, the thinly veiled
Jeers. They should learn some day
that there was that spark of manhood
In him which would kindle the old
fires!
He knew that his past was utterly
dead. And so, walking at the side of
his companion, he boarded the boat.
There was a delay, a brief delay.
The young man turned to him and
said;
"Remember, Bennett, my Ups are
sealed forever. You have your own
future and hers to make or mar. I
know her love for you, and that Is
why I shall remain silent. Can you
honor it? Promise me that from this
day forward you will strive with might
and main to be worthy of her.”
"I promise,” answered Jim humbly,
and the man at his side looked at him
strangely. This seemed to be a new
man—he had known nothing of him.
Along the deck came a white-robed
figure, tripping gladly. Jim knew her
at once. All his heart went out to
her. Elsie had not changed a bit dur
ing those three years, except that
there was more of the woman in her
poise, her thoughtful eyes, and Just
as much of the happy girl In her smil
ing face.
"John!” she exclaimed. "Where —
where is Jim, then? And who is this
gentleman?”
Suddenly Jim realized that she had
not recognized him. His tan, his
beard, the ineffaceable marks of those
three years on his face. . . .
He turned a little away.
“Jim died last week," he said qui
etly. “We didn’t dare to break the
news to you at once. He died—l was
his friend —he wanted me to tell you."
He turned and walked with steady
steps to the ship’s gangway, and along
the wharf.
An Interrogatory Authority.
“Do you regard Bllgglns as an au
thority on financial questions?”
"1 do,” replied Mr. Dustin Stax.
“He has made inquiries in every pos
sible form as to how to borrow
money.”
SNAPS THIEF AT HIS WORK
Automat o Device That Photographs
Bugler While In the Act it
Plying Fit Trade.
For tie fellow who would tether
steal than work, I life is getting herder
all tbe time, sayw the Birmingham
Age-HeiKld.
Take the case of the thief who
broke 11 to a phonographic studio in
Bnevll)i, 111., tbe other day. Prom
tbe viewpoint of tae prowler, e photo
graph shop ought to be quite safe for
the p'lylsg of his trade. Nothing more
dangerous than the chemicals would
be expeated lu such a place—and like
wise little of value to any save tbe
photographer would be found there.
But the owner of the studio In Belle
ville had been fearful of robbery for
some tine. Therefore he Installed an
automatic device to photograph the
Interior of his studio at stated Inter
vals, the device being operated by
ordinary burglar alarm apparatus.
Now the photographer Is out consid
erable photographic supplies, hut he
is able to furnish the police the very
best kind of a description of the thief.
In fact, he turned over several photo
graphs of the burglar at work—one
of which shows him In the act of put
ting a lens Into his pocket.
Once the thief la caught there should
be no difficulty In proving his guilt—
the photographs being powerful though
silent witnesses.
Herein Is a suggestion which may
well be taken advantage of by manu
facturers of burglar alarm apparatus,
for If It worked so well In the photo
graphic studio. It might prove effec
tive as a protection to bank vaults
and other repositories of valuables.
It’s hard on the thief, of course, but
then burglary is getting rather un
popular as an occupation, anyway.
WISE AND HUMANE PROVISION
Uncle Sam, From This Time On, Will
Look After the "Bankers” Hith
erto Neglected.
Those who brave the dangers of
storm, fog and Icebergs of that ele
vated submarine plateau east of Cape
Cod, where the “bankers” seek the
cod, are to be looked after by Uncle
Sam. The men of the big fishing fleet
which puts off from the New England
coast from Gloucester, Boston, New
buryport and Portsmouth lead ex
istences which are dangerous to bod
ily health and even to life Itself.
The fishing craft which seek tbe
cod, hake, halibut and other deop-sea
ground fish on the Georges have mea
ger facilities for men who become dis
abled, and the usual program has been
that when a man got sick he had to
stay sick and take his chances of re
covery, being out of reach of physi
cians, says the New York Press, edi
torially. In a single season many
boats and lives are lost, with numbers
more of men injured.
The national government has placed
the coast guard cutter Androscoggin
at the disposal of fishermen that may
become sick or disabled, and the Unit
ed States public health bureau has
fitted out the boat with hospital appli
ances and fittings. A very thoughtful
and attentive looker after the welfare
and safety of Americana Is Uncle Sam
becoming in many different ways and
directions.
The Argument Closed.
The European war was the subject
of the conversation. The two men
were seated side by side In chairs In
one of the downtown one-arm lunch
rooms. They had fought over several
of the battles, and had also proved
their ability as diplomats by disposing
of a number of the most Important
questions Involved in the great strug
gle. But even then they had been un
able fully to settle the war. Still they
disagreed on some of the main facts.
"Oh, well, nobody is going to be
licked,” one of the lunchroom diplo
mats remarked with much emphasis.
This expression of opinion had fal
len also on the ears of a third man,
seated near the two. He turned quick
ly.
"Yes, but when the war Is over
every country will be broke,” he said.
“And It Is much worse to be broke
than to be licked, and I am speaking
from experience.”
In the lace of this expert testimony
the argument was closed.
Australian High Private.
Olving his name as “John Wren,” a
man applied at the Melbourne (Aus
tralia) town hall a few days ago for
enlistment. He said his business was
“racing,” writes an Associated Press
correspondent.
“Are you the owner of the race
courses?” asked the surprised re
cruiting officer.
“Yes,” he replied. He la perhaps the
most widely known of Australia’s mil
lionaires. He owns several race
courses, a newspaper or two, and Is
Interested In a great variety of indus
trial enterprises. He gave $2,500 as a
prise to the first Australian to win
the Victoria cross.
Wren passed all the tests and was
promptly ticketed as a private In a
newly formed regiment. He gave hU
age as forty-three.
Getting Rid of Callers.
Co-eds of the University of Minne
sota have drawn up a set of specifica
tions for sending male callers home
by 10:30. In this regard the dean of
women, Miss Margaret Sweeney, re
cently said; "Hang up a framed copy
of the rules In some conspicuous place,
girls. Then draw attention to the reg
ulations with some timely remark. If
all else falls, speak up openly and
say; ‘Time Is up, boys.’ ”
f THE RED CHIMNEY |
•! By KEITH KENYON. •!;
In the full flush of summertime
foliage you could not see it from-
Burton's camp, but when the Septem
ber winds began to send the leaves
dancing it stood out plainly, one red
chimney far up the valley of Little
Creek.
The house of the red chimney bad
been untenanted for many years, ho
bad been told at tbe local country
store.
It was the only other house In the
valley besides his own rough lodge,
and be had not resented sharing the
solitude until tbe morning when
smoke rose leisurely into the air
from the red chimney.
Burton watched it with unbelieving
eyes. He waited until afternoon and
then whistled bis horse up from the
lower meadow where it grazed and
saddled it grimly. If any tramps or
loiterers bad taken up their abode
there be made up his mind to oust
them with short shift.
It was a gallop of three miles around
the bend of the river road. As he
drew near, he caught a flutter of
white from a clothesline in the yard.
So the occupant was evidently femi
nine, which deprived him of some of
the Joy of retaliation. Still he looked
decidedly stern and aggressive as he
mounted the wide stone steps and
knocked on the front door.
There was no answer, and after the
second knock the very prettiest face
he had over looked upon appeared at
the window beside him.
“I’m awfully sorry, but we haven’t
found the key to the front door yet.
Won’t you come around the side
way?"
He strode through the grass doubt
fully. On the side porch, In an old
split-bottom rocker, ho found another
tenant, a little older than the first,
but very nearly as dlstractlngly
pretty, and this one was paring po
tatoes.
"How do you do?” she said cheer
fully. “Are you one of our neigh
bors?”
"I rather think I am your only
neighbor in the valley," answered Bur
ton gravely. "I have lived hero three
years in the summertime. Burton is
my name."
"Ours is Colby. lam Beatrice Col
by. This is my sister Nan.”
Nan smiled at him and handed out
another chair. Before he knew It,
Burton was thawing and telling them
all about the valley and of his coming
to It when his own health had broken
down back In New York. He had ob
tained tenting rights first from the
trustee of the land, Probably they
had rented from the same person.
“No,” Nan told him quite (rankly,
“we Just drove over and stayed here.”
Squatter rights evidently, thought
Burton, and he made up his mind to
speak to old Newton about It. Yet
the days passed and he permitted the
Interlopers to remain undisturbed.
It was rather pleasant to see smoke
coming from the red chimney. Every
other day he rode over to be sure his
neighbors were getting along well.
Nan, he found out. was the housekeep
er. Beatrice was the provider for
the family. They confided to him
that she collected antiques for a New
York dealer, and that they Jaunted
around to all kinds of out-of-the-way
places.
It was at the end of the fourth
week that Burton, looking at himself
In the glass hung on his tent pole,
told himself that he was in love. He
looked over at the red chimney and
accused it in his mind. Then he looked
again and saw something that made
him hold bis breath. Up from the red
chimney came masses of sulphurous
smoke that stained the deep blue of
the morning sky.
When he dropped from his saddle
later, the white froth clung to his
horse’s flanks and breast, but he ran
on up to the old house and found the
two girls fighting a chimney fire.
Nan had taken a ladder and leaned
It against the house and tried to
reach the chimney with salt bags,
but bad missed her footing.
"It’s only a sprain,” she called to
him from the grass. "Go and help
Beatrice. Mr, Newton came over,
too."
"I don’t care it the whole thing
goes up In smoke,” he said huskily,
kneeling beside her. “Are you badly
hurt. Tell me the truth, Nan.”
“I’m all right, truly, truly.” She
tried to draw away from him, but
Burton possessed her hands.
‘T’ve loved you ever since I saw you
at the window. Nan. You know It,
too. Don’t laugh at me.”
“Shall I cry?” she asked whimsi
cally. “You can’t, you know. You’ve
Just bated us for spoiling your val
ley.”
“It’s our valley now,” he said, when
Beatrice and Mr. Newton came around
the corner of the house bearing mops
and pails.
“Well, it’s out,” said the old man.
"How do you like your two landlords,
Mr. Burton?”
Burton looked nonplused.*'
“You know this whole valley Is the
old Colby estate. I’m mighty glad
two of them cared enough about It
to come home.”
And he regarded them as invaders.
He turned to Nan appealingly.
"Shall I ever be forgiven?”
She laughed and held out her hand.
“Do you think we would have put
up with you so long, Jack, If we
hadn’t intended taking you Into the
family?”

GO BACK TO OLD REMEDIES
War Brings a Return to Medlolnea
Used In the Days of Our
Qrandfathors.
Physicians have boon Jumping from
one drug or chemical to another over
since Lister found away to obsok or
prevent the Infection of wounds. Doc
tors have tried friars balsam, carbolic
acid, lodoform and dozens of other
antiseptics, some of them Very costly,
and now seem to have gone back to
old fashioned household dressings of
past years and even past centuries.
On the battlefields of Europe sugar,
salt, tincture of iodine and common
garlic have superseded drugs and
chemicals with high sounding names,
the New York Commercial states. Su
gar is used as a dressing for wounds
already infected. The British govern
ment has found that wounded men on
ships whose injuries have been
washed with common sea water make
better recoveries than those treated
in field hospitals, the conclusion being
that the waters of the ocean are an
ideal antiseptic. Tincture of iodine, a
preparation as old as the hills, Is the
favorite protection against lockjaw;
and so It goes.
Of all these reversions to grand
mother's specifics, however, the dia
covery that garlic Is almost a cureall
is the most striking. Doctors who
prescribe and use only the most costly
and new-fangled pieparatlons im
ported from Germany will have to
give respectful attention to garlic, for
Its efficacy Is vouched for by the Lon
don Lancet on the testimony of two
eminent London surgeons. Garlic ap
plied to a wound stops the Infection
and heals quickly, whereas modern
antiseptics used In fashionable prac
tice injure the tissues. Garlic has
been tested thoroughly at the Pad
dington infirmary in London, as well
as in field hospitals in Prance.
The story of the rediscovery of gar
lie possesses human interest. An old
French peasant woman was found to
have dressed thw sores and wounds of
soldiers in the wa. zone with remark
able results. An army surgeon inves-,
tlgated and garlic is sold by the ton
where it was formerly sold by tha
ounce in England chemists' shops.
Garlic Juice diluted with three or fgur
parts of distilled water seems to bo
the standard dressing.
Garlic is also found to be effective
in preventing tuberculosis and in cur
ing it in its early stages. The com
mon onion, cousin of the clove of gar
lic, Is good for colds. Hindus have
used plasters of garlic for ages. Just
when speculators have cornered the
drug and chemical market, army doc
tors find substitutes in things that arc
cheap and plentiful.
Finn Boy Escapes Jail Sentence.
It may be true that “there is noth
ing new under the sun, 1 ’ but Judge
Howard’s daily experience in the mu
nicipal court of Rockland brings up
lots of things that are new to him.
Among the offenders who faced him
the other day was a Finn boy who bad
been arrested for shooting a raccoon
out of season. The boy did not deny
the act, but asked the court to hear
his defense, which he read from manu
script prepared by himself. It was as
ingenious setting forth of the circum
stances which led to the coon's de
struction—a tale of how the glaring
eyes of a strange animal bad fright
ened belated pedestrians in a Weal
Rockford suburb; how a frightened
woman had implored him to “get a
gun and shoot the creature.'' The
young Finn’s ‘‘brief was so well pre
pared that Judge Howard suspended
sentence. —Augusta (Me.) Kenneben
Journal.
Fiameless Guns.
Airships equipped with machine
guns run a certain degree of risk from
an explosion caused by the flame at
the muzzle of the gun. Hence con
siderable study has been devoted to
obviating this danger. This has no*
been accomplished by a young Floren
tine chemist named Outdo Pel. He ie
said to have recently given a demon
stration before an Italian military
commission of a new powder Invented
by him which burns without either
flame or smoke and does not flare up
on detonation. While specially use
ful for the guns of aircraft, it will be
of value in artillery and infantry en
gagements from the fact that it will
not betray the firing line to the en
emy.
i
Deadly War Engine.
Some time ago a St. Paul (Minn.)
man produced a wireless electric ma
chine by means of whieh he says he
flashed dogs and rabbits to death at n
distance of over 100 feet. When Eng
lish and French offleera refused to
consider it for use in the war he says
he turned it over to the German army.
He believes it is now being used by
the Germans in killing their enemiaa
and in setting off powder stations.
