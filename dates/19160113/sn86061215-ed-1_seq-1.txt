London, Jan. 12. Annonucement
of the occupation of Mount Lovcen in
•, Montenegro, although It Is not confirm
ed from entente sources, is generally
accepted here aB true. Uneasiness
which is freely expressed In Italy is
reflected in the English and French
newspapers. The loss of Lovcen, from
the point of view of the allies, is seri
ous owing to the fact that its
In Champagne the GermanB (hold a
slight gain, made as a result pf the
determined offensive of last Saturday
and Sunday. The French military
authorities say that the German forces
which delivered the attack lost heavily
as with three divisions, they advanced
In the face of the artillery fire of the
French which took a terrible toll.
Germans To Withdraw.
From the eastern front it is report
ed that a comparative lull at present
prevails. Special dispatches affirm
that the Russians have been so suc
cessful in consolidating their new
positions that the Austro-Germans
have begun to remove the supplies
from their bases which they had es
tablished in preparation for the ad
vance which thy intended to make in
the coming spring.
FRENCH REPORT QUIET.
London,' Jan. 12.—The official
-fcYench report of this afternoon as re
ceived here by wireless follows:
"There were no events of import
ance last night except in the region
between the Meuse and the Argonne,
where "our batteries dispersed groups
of enemy sappers who were at work in
the region of Malincourt."
ATTACK Is FAILURE.
Berlin, Jan. 12.—The failure of a
French attack on German positions
north of LeMesnil in the Champagne
along a front of about 1,000 yards was
announced by the war office today.
An ammunition depot in the south
ern sections of Lille, northern France,
has been blown up. An official an
nouncement says that seventy per
sons were killed and forty injured.
Considerable damage to property
done.

.dominates Cattaro bay, the Austrian
naval base. Before Italy entered the
war the French had established a
number of guns which could have
swept the bay. Austria, seizing it,
forestalls this danger and is in a com
manding position with regard to Cet
tinje, the capital of Montenegro, which
is a little over six miles distant.
The Austrian advance, considering
the distance to be covered, was much
'slower than that made in the Teuton
conquest of Serbia, but in considera
tion of the formidable obstacles which
the mountainous character of the coun
try presents, it is conceded that the in
vaders are making steady progress.
Another Blunder.
The question is being anxiously
raised as to why the entente allies did
not long ago send aid to the Monten
egrins, and In particular why Italy,
which is more acutely affected by this
Austrian Invasion, had not taken pre
ventive measures. The Austrlans are
now only ten miles from the capital of
Montenegro, and a successful blow at
the heart of the country may have the
effect, it is said by military critics, of
Isolating the troops who are defending
the northeastern frontier.

PICKED TROOPS
FAIL IN ASSAULTS
UPON THE FRENCH
REGIMENTS OF THE GERMAN IM
PERIAL GUARDS USED IN
RECENT OFFENSIVE.
Chalons-sur-Marne, France, Jan. 12.
—The fact that regiments of the im
perial guard were among the 60,000
men that attacked the French lines in
Champagne on Sunday indicates how
carefully the Germans selected their
troops for this great assault A con
siderable number of prisoners taken
by the French belonged to the famous
guards.
The attack followed one of the heav
1 bombardments the Germans have
iyet inflicted upon the French posi
tions. It lasted twenty-four hours.
The promptness of the French reply
with concentrated fire from their three
inch guns stopped the first waves of
the attack on the parapets of the Ger
man trenches. Only at the fourth at
tempt did the Germans, after heavy
losses, get up to the French trenches.
The surprising promptness of the
French counter attack caught the
Germans before they could organize
the positions they had won. Many
were obliged to surrender and only a
few got back to their own lines.

of Serbia has been proclaimed king of
Serbia at Belgrade, by the German

The only available record of irregu

was said to become involved in finan

resulted in one death and injury to
more than a hundred in the rioting of

refused to assure the governor that the
hanging would be conducted properly.
Bloomfleld, Jan. 12.—J. D. Moore
took his own life Tuesday at noon by
hanging at his home ten miles south
of Bloomfleld, to which place he had
moved about a year ago from Douds
Leando. The body was found in the
barn by Arthur Mather, a rural mail
carrier, who hunted him at the re
quest of Mrs. Moore. The latter had
become alarmed at the absence of her
husband who frequently threatened to
take his own life lately. The deceased
had been despondent over financial
matters for some time past and the
hanging is thought to be the result of
his brooding. He was 43 years of age.
Beside the wife, several brothers and I
sisters survive.
Funeral arrangements are not defi
nite as yet, pending the arrival of re-1States
latives, but will probably take place
Thursday morning.

SIXTEEN LINED UP
AND SHOT TO DEATH
Only Onfe Escapes to Bring
News of Murder Across
the Border Line
Washington, D. C., Jan. 12.—
As soon as the senate assembled
Senator Sherman, republican, In
troduced a resolution proposing
Intervention In Mexico by the
United States and the six Pan
American nations which have act
ed with It In Mexican affairs, un
less Gen. Carranza complies with
a demand to protect foreign Uvea
and property.
The resolution which was refer
red to the foreign relations com
mittee proposed that it be the
sense of the senate, that a demand
be made upon Gen. Carranza to
protect the lives and property of
Americans that other countries
of the western hemisphere be In
vited to join in that demand, and
that, in event of failure to comply
with that demand, the president
should invite cooperation of Pan
American governments to Inter
vene In Mexico to protect life and
property, the troops to be with
drawn as soon as order and gov
ernment are restored.
Senator Gallinger, republican
leader, declared the United States
should demand full and quick re
paration.
"There should* be conclusive ac
tion taken in this matter," said he.
"If full reparation is not made, the
government should take action
necessary to enforce It."
Washington, D. C., Jan. 12.—Secre
tary Lansing today telegraphed Gen.
Carranza calling for the prompt pun
ishment of the bandits who executed
seventeen Americans near Chihuahua
Monday. Through Eliseo Arredondo,
the newly appointed Mexican ambas
sador here, it was arranged to bring
the bodies from Chihuahua to Juarez
today on a special train.
Secretary Lansing issued a state
ment in which he said the state de
partment "feels that it took every pos
sible precaution to prevent Americans
from exposing their lives in a region
where guerrilla warfare is in pro
gress," and that "it is to be deplored
that its advice was not followed."
Secretary Lansing's statement fol
lows:
"In October the department sent the
strongest kind of instructions to the
consuls in the states of Chihuahua and
Sonora calling upon them to use every
means in their power to persuade
Americans to leave immediately for
the United States. A few came out.
Some, regardless of the disturbed con
ditions existing in Mexico, did not
heed the warning.
"It was only two or three weeks ago
that Villa detained thirty Americans
in the very district in which the un
fortunate Americans now reported
killed met their death. Recently the
Villistas are said to have stated that
they would kill Americans in Chihua
hua territory, in order to force Ameri
can intervention.
"The department feels that it took
every possible precaution to prevent
Americans from exposing their lives in
a region where guerrilla warfare is in
progress. It is to be deplored that its
advice was not followed.
"Every step will be taken to see that
the perpetrators of this dastardly
crime are apprehended and punished."
WASHINGTON IS EXCITED
Washington, D. C., Jan. 12.—Official
dispatches from Chihuahua, Mexico,
to the state department today say the
bodies of the seventeen Americans
shot by Villa bandits arrived at that
city last night.
Secretary Lansing's only announce
ment on the case was'that the United
would look to Gen. Carranza
"for satisfaction." The question of
what steps the United States will take
depends upon development of the
facts.
Customs Collector Cobb at El Paso
today reported that his investigation
seems to establish that sixteen were
killed.

SEVERED FACTIONS.
Chicago, Jan. 12.—Most of the mem
bers of the progressive national com
mittee and party leaders left for their
homes today after deciding last night
to hold the national convention in
Chicago on June 7, concurrently with
the republican national convention.
After the completion of the work of
the committee, many of the leaders
expressed the opinion that the way
had been opened for a common lead
ership of the progressive and republi
can parties.
The next progressive gathering will
be held in New York City probably
within two weeks, when the executive
committee of the national committee
will assemble for the purpose of pre
paring a call and beginning prepara
tions for the convention.
In the declaration of principles,
which was adopted without a dissent
ing vote, the belief was expressed that
the surest way to secure for the coun
try a suitable leader will be "by hav
ing both progressive and republican
parties choose the same standard bear
er and the same principles."
Continuing the declaration of prin
ciples says:
"If the republican convention Is re
sponsive to the patriotic spirit that
brought the republican party into be
ing and that made it dominant for
half a century if it meets this crisis
in the spirit of broad patriotism that
rises above partisanship, the effort
for a common leadership will be suc­
Addressing the conference of party
leaders, George W. Perkins, chairman
of the executive committee, said:
"We are all hoping that both par
ties will agree on somebody and the
candidate need not necessarily be Col.
Roosevelt.''

FAIR BOARD TO
Committee of Eighteen Is
Called in Session to
Perfect Organization
CHAIRMAN WILL BE
NAMED AT MEETING
Details bf Exposition Will
Be Gone Into and Work
Will Be Started
The men selected as a committee
to perfect the organization of the pro
posed southern Iowa and northern
Missouri fair, were called to meet this
afternoon in the Commercial associa
tion rooms at 3:30 o'clock.
The committee was named at the
order of the mass meeting held
(sev-
eral days ago when the project for the
I big exposition was launched. At that
meeting there was a great amount of!
enthusiasm for the proposed fair and
a large crowd was present. Out*of
town speakers were J. F. Deems and
G. Holcombe of Burlington, both of
ficers of the Tri-State fair that opened
in the river city last summer.
Largely on the information supplied
by the visitors who related their own
experiences and showed what can be
accomplished by a big fair, the meet
ing decided upon a committee of eigh
teen men, nine from Ottumwa and the
balance from outside the city to take'
up the organization of the project.
These have since been named.
With the organization of the pro
posed fair completed and once under
way, those who have given the project
most thought believe that one of the
best moves ever made by Ottumwa
and this community will have been'
made. That many feel this way about
the fair was evident at the meeting
held when the proposition was launch
ed. The detailB of the organization I
will be gone into, a chairman elected
and work started toward having a
large and attractive fair in Ottumwa if
the plans of the committee do not mis
carry or the severe weather does not
interfere with the attendance. Sub
committees will also be appointed this
afternoon.
It has been announced that Oska
loosa has already secured $40,000 of
the $50,000 that is to be invested in the
fair to be held in that city.
FLOOD PREVAILS

FRENCH ORDERED
TO RESPECT GREEKS
Paris, Ja«k. 11.—Gen. Sarrall, com

troops, from which the Salonlki cor
respondent of the Temps quotes the
following as the most Important pas
sage:
"1 repeat again, you must all, both
officers and men, observe toward the
officers of the Greek army of rank
superior to your own the authorized
rules of deference and the outward
marks of respect. You will be good
enough to entertain relations of
friendliest comradeship with the mili
tary men of your own rank."

OFFICIALS 00 NOT
INCENDIARISM
STORY OF FIREBUGS IN TUES
DAY'S BLAZE CENSURED BY
MAYOR CARTER.
"I do not think It will be necessary
to investigate the fire of Tuesday
morning as I think it was accidental,"
said Fire Chief Charles Sloan when
Interviewed this morning about the
rumored incendiarism. "While the
fires in the rear of the Ottumwa Bug
gy Co., and the Baker Piano store do
not look well I do not think there was
any attempt made to burn the stores
and I am positive in my own mind that
the Friedman fire was not caused by a
firebug.
Chief Sloan is firm in his belief that
the fire at the Friedman store was ac
cidental and when questioned as to
calling the state fire marshal, he re
plied, 'T did not call the state marshal
or any of his agents and I do not in
tend to. I understand however that
the marshal was called by an Ottum
wan hut I did not think it necessary
to start an investigation."
An effort was made this morning to
find out if any call had been sent from
Ottumwa to the state fire marshal's
office at Des Moines, but there is no
record of such a call.
Mayor Fred H. Carter and Fire
Chief Charles Sloan investigated the
fire at the Ottumwa Buggy Co., believ
ed to have been incendiary. "I think
the stories being circulated to the ef
fect that the fires were caused by
firebugs Is entirely unwarranted," said
the mayor. "While the origin of the
fires seems mysterious I do not think
anyone would build a fire outside of
the buildings if they Intended to set
fire to them."
Commissioner of Public Improve
ment W. J. Berry Investigated the fire
in the rear of the Baker piano store
and stated this morning that he placed
no confidence in the stories of fire
bugs.
Blaze Breaks Out.
At 7:30 o'clock this morning the de
partment v:as called to the Wool worth
store where a blaze had started. Two
firemen remained in the ruins all last
night to prevent a blaze and early this
morning turned the task over to the
night watchman. The blaze was dis
covered after the firemen left and the
department was called. This morning
Chief Sloan had the hose which has
been stretched across the street re
moved so that traffic can be resumed
on Main street. Water is still being
used on the ruins from three streams.
Watchmen employed by the differ
ent stores remained near the ruins
during the night so as to prevent
people from entering and taking the
goods. The front walls of the build
ings are still standing but no danger
Is being entertained of their falling.
THIRD EXPLOSION

Last Sunday night there was a blast
