FRENCH LAND ON ;
GREEK ISLAND OF CORFU
Matter Taken Under Advisement By
"."- Greek Cabinet.
London, Jan. 12, 11.67 p. m. A
French detachment has been landed
vvf the Greek inland of Corfu for pro
visional occupation, according to an
Athens despatch to Router's Telegram
Company. Fourteen ships of - unknown
nalonality are cruising around Corfu.
French soldiers occupied the Achil
leion, on which the French flag was
hoisted. ? '
The - occupation of Corfu, Bay the
advices from Athens, is a repetition
of what has happened on other Greek
islands. The- matter has been taken
under advisement by the Greek cab
inet and a protest against the occupa
tion of Corfu, which is being formu
lated, is expected to be more energetic
than previous protests sent to the en
tente powers. , -
It is understood that the landing of
the French troops is preparatory to
the transference -there of a portion of
the Serbian army for the purpose of
rest and re-fitting. ' ,
The Achlllelon was erected In 1890
for the Empress Elisabeth of AuBtrla.
The villa was purchased in 1907 by
the German emperor. .

Austrian Repulse Russians.
On the Russian front the Austrian
official communication records re
newed desperate attacks by the Rus
sians on the Bessarabian frontier, but
insists, that the attacks everywhere
were repulsed. The Petrograd com
munication is -silent on the subject,
but the Russians usually withhold
mention of their movements until they
are well on the road to completion.
Quiet on Western Front.-'
There have been no important de-
velopements on the western front.
The blowing up of a large German
munitions depot near Lille is ad
mitted in the German communication.
According to one account this was
due to a . British air raid. The English
press believes that the cautious word
ing of the German communication con
ceals a disaster of large proportions.
Spirit- of Optimism Shown By Allies.
There is a great spirit of optimism
both in British and' French despatches
from the west front, the correspon
dents expressing the firm conviction
of the allied generals that there is no
possibility of any successful German
offensive anywhere In the west i lines.
-The -ewrrespondetfr-'o -JtTJt'Ter'
egram Company sends from, British
headquarters an. interview with an un
named prominent staff - - officer, - who
was quoted as saying:
.. Allies Outnumber Germans.
"We now have full information
about the German forces facing us.
We know their exact dispositions and
strength. We everywhere outnumber
the Germans, and also outnumber
them in both field and heavy artillery
and our weapons are better than
theirs. We can fire five shells to
their one without depleting our muni
tions. We can .. take their first line
of trenches whenever we wish.
"To say that we have got them
beaten is dangerous rubbish, but, the
truth is, we have got them ready for
a beating." -

BOOMING SENATOR WEEKS

Resolution Commending - Him Passed
by Mass. Republican State Commit

Boston, Jan. 12. A resolution com
mending Senator Weeks to the people
of the country as a man who would
make "a -strong, forceful ' and able
president," was adopted at a meeting
of the republican state committee to
day. The name of no other candi
date was mentioned in the discussion,
members of the committee eaid, al
though doubt was expressed as to the
expediency of making any utterance at
this time on the subject of presidential
preferences.
Edward A. Thurston of Fall River
was again chosen president of the com
mittee and other officers were also re
elected. , The resolutions follow:
"We, the members of the state re
publican committee, in annual meeting
assembled,' recognizing . in John W.
Weeks, Junior senator from Massachu
setts, a man eminently fitted by train
ing, business experience and congres
sional service for the high office of
president of the United - States, do
hereby express our confidence in his
ability, his sterling worth and his un
swerving loyalty to the principles of
the republican party, and commend
him to the people of the United States
as a man who would make a strong,
forceful and able president of this
great country."
Charles S. Baxter, who managed
Governor McCall's successful campaign
as the head of the republican ticket in
the- state election last fall, issued . a
statement tonight, saying: ,
"The state committee was not chosen
to present candidates to the country,
or, for that matter, to the state. The
people are in control in Massachusetts
and thousands of republicans will re
sent this unauthorized action of their
representatives in the state commit

Urged Upon House .Naval Committee
by Rear Admiral Stanford.
Washington, -Jan. 12. - Imperative
need of two dreadnought drydocks on

J3,5O0,00O and the other somewhere
south of HSitteras the choice lying
between Guantanamo, Mobile ah 3 New
Orleans.
Guantanamo, 'Admiral Stanford
thought, was the best site' of the
three, considering its location, and the
prediction that "if we have trouble it
probably come in the Carribbean."
Summarized, his estimates of ' the
sites follows:1 - -
New Orleans Good site for $2,500,
OOfl floating dock. ;
Mobile 'Worth considering if a first
class gulf site is to be chosen.
Guantanamo Best site of aft, but
handicapped by necessity of fortifica
tions and mobile army to defend the
base, and by scarcity of labor, ship
materials and . supplies. A graving
dock at Guantanamo wculd cost 4
000.000; shops, with heavy machine
tool equipment, Jl,60O,000, and the to
tal for development would reach about
J7.O,00. - .
To provide eight navy yards with
two 'battleships, building ways and
accommodations, the admiral said,
would require a total of 22,000.000, as
follows:
Boston. J2.200JKH): New York.- J 2,-
100,000: Philadelphia, J2,7O0,OO; Nor

scenes of uproarious enthusiasm the

night defeated a motion to reject the
military service bill by a vote of 431

house acceded to the premier's re

The vote was chiefly interesting on
account of the changed attitude of

it on the first reading. .
' The debate was closed bv Arthur

murder squad was sent to the uni

the affair and they will appear be

to Alison s oeatn is held. -
Fight Fiercest in Years.
The fight was one of the fiercest held
In years by the two classes. Lifson'
death was the first fatality in the long
list 01 oowi nghts since 1870, al
tEough there have been men injured
In these contests.
The fight was to have been held on
the football gradiron at Franklin field,
but the turf was too soft and the bat
tle was transferred to the rrounds of
the commercial museum nearby. There
were 700 men in the struggle, 400 soph
omores and S00 freshmen. Some
wore football togs and others were
otripped to the waist. .
The first period of the fight resulted
In a draw. In this period the object

Edward A. Lifson. a senior In the
Wharton School of Finance of the uni
versity and a brother of the dead
freshman who saw the fight, said that
his brother's death, was accidental. He
did not want the police to make any
arrests.
Pruvost Edyar Smith was shocked
when he learned of Lifson's death. He
said:
"Tho question of the continuation of
the bowl fight and other fights will re
ceive careful and serious consideration
after a few days.. In the light of what
occurred I am sure no one would care
to have this form of sport continue.
