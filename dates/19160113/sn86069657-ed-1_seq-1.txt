The Value of Education.
Tho following is the text of a
talk prepared'b.V D. H. Matherly,
to be delivered- fo tho pupils of
the City School.
There is scattered over this broad
country of ours, ydung men upon whom
the major part ofdeveloping the fut
ure generation' vill depend; yet it
seems us tlin t hoy arc making slow
progress townrd ;tbe development of
their possibilities. Hero is where the
rpsponsibilty fallen upon the parents
In oui little town here, many parents
seem to be in nn unconscious state, for
tho fact, that they nllow their boys to
ctlltivato the habit ana desire for cigar
ettes, which are destroying tho cream
of their lives. And more tiian that,
they keep their boy's fromjschool take
them from the care of our efficient and
christian-hearted teachers, who are de
voting every moment possible toward
their development and let them work
for the little sum of thirty-five to seventy-five
cents perlitay. Parents, put
your boys in school and help them lay
the foundation in future usefulness.
Young man, arise,; develop yourself
and be found in that class of American
youth who aspire to a higher and bet
ter education. Durjng tiie lust decado
the growth in the number of those
seeking a higher education lias been
phenominal. This vast host of young
men have chosen to pursue a college
course' rather than watte their time
upon things of less .importance.
. Let us consider some things that led
rtieni'MJnkesiriblibI.: , .
t. Education increases the Earning
Power of the Individual.
The average earning power of nnuu-
educatcd nuin is not more than $150
per day. At this rate his eanings for
thirty years, of 300 days each, would
amount to $13,500. Suppose an edit-
cnted man should receive salary of
only $900 per year, hts earnings during
the same period iif thirty years would
amount to $'27,500, or $18,500 more
than hii uneducated brother. The col
lege year of' thlrty-nix weeks of Ave
days each, would amount to 720 days
or four school years, which are requir
ed to get u college education. A little
figuring will make, it plain that this
man who received 1000 per year, re
ceived $18.70 for e cli day Hpent in col
lege.
J. American Youth is ambitious to
achieve Success in Life.
The ambition is a worthy ono. by
them any accomplishment is frequent
ly measured by its money value, or its
guin is personal preferment mid dis
tinction. While litis may not bo the
best incentive for pursuing h college
course, nevertheless the facts show that
in tho increiiblngly keen competitions
of tho various occupations and profes
sions, the man with college training
has a decided advantage in gaining
such distinction.
A college education is seen tu bo the
shortest and best course for aspiring
youth. JJ'lth the dlscipllng and devel
oping of mind which lie 1ms undergone
in college, he readily surpasses his
competitors who lack this thorough
preparation.
Innumerable cases arc on record to
show that the most rapid promotions
and highest distinctions labusiness and
professional life have been won by
those who first took time to secure a
broad and thorough collego course Ap
polton's Encyclopedia of American Bi
ography gives sketches of over 15,000
eminent Americans, Of theso moro
than one-third are college men. It is
estintnted that ono out of ten thousand
uneducated men attain such distinc
tions as to merit notice la his work,
while among college men one in every
forty 1ms received this recognition.
TU gives the college man 2V) times
more chances of winning famo and dis
tinction than his less fortunate brother
who has not a college education. The
higher the position or profession which
wc consider, the. higher the, ratio In
favor of the collego man.

A number from here attended the

We are informed that the Mint Cola
Bottling plant will shortly be moved
to Winchester, wiierc they will have a
better opportunity to build up their
steadily increasing business. Wo re
gret to see this business leave hen;, as
weneed it and other industries to keep
going ahead. We need a Commercial
Olnb here to look after matters of that
kind and encourage factories and in
dustries to locate hero nnd stay here,
but there seems little or no enthusi
asm along that line, every one being
content to let every one else shift for
himself. Mr. McCormiuk will also
move to Winchester witli his family to
have charge of the plant.
The following little paragraph
hits the nail on the head pretty
well. "An exchange says that
alcohol will remove grass stains
from summer clothes. The ex
change is right, It will also re-

gpring and winter clothes, not
only fronythe man wjho driulcsjt,

the smile from thu face of his
wife, and the happiness from his

alcohol lias few equaL". Alcohol
kept iiiaiiv a little uirl and boy
around Stanton from having
any Christmas this year. The
writer asked one little fellow
what he got for Christinas this
year, ami he said, "Nothing"
and the tears came to his eyes
Tins writer knows that the father
of that little Imt received a
gallon of whiskey the dav before
Christmas.' In another home in
Stanton a little girl didn't, get a
tiling for Christinas, but there
was an abundance of whiskey or
dered. The writer has been in
that home, and alcohol has re
moved nearly everything from it,
till it is little better than a hovel.

L. F. Martin Answers
P. O. Derthlch.
I wisli tho public to understand
something more about my booklet that
that I wrote on what the Presbyterian
Church was and what some of its
teaching was. This book Eld. P. O.
Dcrthick has struck at with a very
heavy club, but has failed to land one
blow on one word or statement that 1
have made in my booklet.
I wish the readers of the Times to
know that every statement that I make
in my little booklet is true, and that I
am ready to back up witli the proof, at
any time and any place.
And I also wish the public to under
stand that my booklet is not against
any one, personally, except on the last
page in which I refer to some things
that Dr. Edward O. Gucrrant has made
on the mountain people. Theso state
ments I am ready to back up with the
proof.
On the first t o pnges of my book
are somr articles that were taken from
the Presbyterian Confession of Faith.
On the third page some Questions and
Answers, and on the fourth page is
What the Will of God is
Now, Eld I'. O. Dertliick has not
denied my booklet being facts, but lias
in a way tried to make it appear that
I have applied it personally to I5ro.
Irvin, or some other good man. This
I have not done, but have published
in my booklet things that are in tho
Presbyterian Confession of Faith.
I do' not deirji that there are some
(-peopitr tfc'nt et!ive. Mid'are Hviujr, a
chrislain life with their names in tho
Presbyterian church, hut I do deny
that the Presbyterian Confession of
Faith is true
Eld P. O Dcrthick claims that wc
must recognize the rights of other men
to their convictions. I deny it and
claim that we art not to recognize any
thing but the teaching of Christ.
And I deny that the Presbyterian
Confession is the teaching of Christ,
and that it is not in accord with the
teaching of Christ.
He claims that the Presbyterian
church is a sister to the Church of
Christ. I deny that the Church of
Christ lias any sisters. I claim that
the Presbyterian church was organized
1.500 years from the time "that tho
Church of Christ was set up.
