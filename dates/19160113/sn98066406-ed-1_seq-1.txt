Business Increasing.
A representative of the Expositor
visited the fur rooms of Henry 1'.
Ohmer last week and found that gentle
man busily engaged in dressing and
stretching skins, preparatory to ship
ping them to outside hrms. Although
Mr. Ohmer was very busy he fonud
time to show us what stock he has on
on hand, and it was quite a surpriso to
imd so many in such a small space.
He has on hand nearly three thousand
skunk ekins, upwards of two thousand
muskrats, a large number of beaver,
fox and other hides, also many beef and
horse skins. From a small start made
a few years ago, Mr. Ohmer has built
up. a business which reaches all over
the state of Michigan, and his buyings
now totals well up In the thousands of
dollars each season, and is steadily in
creasing year by year. Here's hoping
that hiB business may increase many
years, and that he may make a million
dollars out of his little "skin game."
To Haul Gravel for Road Work
Walter R. Stevens, county road com
missioner, spent Saturday and Sunday
at Yale in an effort to interest the
farmers and citizens of this vicinity In
the construction work which is con
templated on the roads east of Yale
for next spring.
Mr. Stevens states that he succeeded
in arranging for the purchase and haul
ing of gravel from the Ohmer pit. The
gravel is to be stored in piles along the
roads which are to be improved and it
is expected that thing will be In readi
ness for the spring work. The roads
east of Yale are county roads and not
a part of the trunk line highway.
The farmers of this vicinity are much
interested in the plans that have been
outlined and once the gravel is on the
ground for the work it is expected that
a series of "road bees" will bring good
results in improving the roads near
Yale.
