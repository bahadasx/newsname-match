ACED^PIOHEER IS
CHILE!
ONE OF RAMSEY COUNTY'S OLD
TIMERS PASSED AWAY AT THE
HOME OF HIS SON NEAR ED-
MORE.
-,1- 1
That grim reaper death has again
called another of our Ramsey county
pioneers home and took from our
midst one of our oldest citizens in the
person of Thomas Madden, who pass
ed away at the home of his son, Frank,
who lives about six miles west of Ed
more.
Mr. Madden came to Ramsey coun
ty in the early days and located hear
Grand Harbor, wherphe was engaged
in farming, and later moved to the vil
lage of Grand Harbor where he made
his home for some years, but when the
territory in the northeastern part of
the county was being opened up and
the village of Edmore established Mr.
Madden secured a valuable homestead
near Edmore and moved there and
proved it up and lived on it for many
years. But owing to his failing health
he has lived with his son Frank, for a
number of years past. He had spent
an active life and acquired a comforta
ble property, and while he was not an
man, he has passed the three score
and ten. Mr. Madden was a man who
was well liked and few old timers of
the county was more widely known
than him. He leaves one son, Frank,
"besides other relatives to mourn his
death. The funeral will be held from
St. Joseph's Catholic church in this
city tomorrow (Friday) at ten o'clock
A. M., and the remains will be laid to
rest in the local cemetery. The be
reaved ones have the sympathy of all
in their hour of sorrow.

YOUNG HEALING
THE BREACH
WITH HIS AID THE DEMOCRATS
OF THE STATE MAY BE ABLE
TO GET TOGETHER.
Congressman YoUng of this state
has recently introduced a bill in con
gress to create a second Federal judi
cial district in North Dakota. We
agree with the Minot Optic, when they
say that this measure is a travesty on
Necessity.
It looks as though our congressman
who poses as a Republican, was lend
ing his aid to the Democrats of this
state in helping to heal the breach
which has been growing in that party
for some time. There is now one Fed
eral Judicial district in this state,
which is ainple imdplenty. "For years
there has been very little important
litigation in the Federal Court in
North Dakota, the majority of cases
being what is known as "Indian" cases
and just why Uncle Sam should be
compelled to create another district
for the purpose of making room for a
few disgruntled office seekers is not
just plain.
When the Democrats too the reins
of government when Wilson was elect
ed there were several candidates for
the various federal positions. Tobias
Casey had someassurances that he
would be givenrfhe 1J. S. district at
torneyship, but he was ditched for M.
A. Hildreth, Wm. Collins of Botti
neau was in the race for U. S. mar
shal, and some claim that he was
promised the place, but Was cast aside
for Joe Doyle. These things with sev
eral others has caused some bad feel
ing in the Democratic party in this
state, and before another election
comes along tilings mustbe fixed and
now Mr. Yornyj steps in to aid them
in healing this breach, as.lfthis bill is
passed there will be a duplication of
the Federal court poittibnsf to fill in
this state, and Mr. Collins^' Casey and
others can have another whack at the
pie counter. This law would create
the petition of another Federaljudge,
giving a position for life to some good
Democrat, a U. S. Marshal and Dis
trict attorney, a Clerk and stenog
rapher and other minor positions. Yes
North Dsikota needs another Federal
district about as much as a cat needs
two tails. If Mr. Young can't find
something bette- to employ his time
when down at Washington, we- sug
that liiB organise:« '^uhi-ditita^

Athens, Jan. 12.—(Correspondence
of the Associated Press)—Field Mar
shal Earl Kitchener left a very vivid
impression on the Athenian popula
tion, and especially bn Constantine I,
King of hte Greeks. Speaking of the
British war minister's visit, the Greek
monarch said to the Associated Press
correspondent:
'1 am a soldier. Kitchener is a sol
dier. We speak the same language
and we understand one another per
fectly from the outset." 7
One story which Lord Kitchener told
in Athens made a particularly deep
impression. No public account of the
incident hag ever been given.
"When the maneuvers of the great
•fleet wtre
north of Scotland," said Lord Ketche
ner, eight German submarines of the
newest and- strongest- type! i»iit
with the ptttpp'se of geti&ig iof- tie
fleet and playing havoc with the. ma
neuvers: One came to grief. in our
North Sea net. The others nosed
thru and approached the fleet. But
there was another net heading them
off. They tried to break thru to get
around to find an opening. But tliere
was none. Two more were lost in this
effort. Finally, the remainder decided
to return to their base&t Helgoland.
"But they could no longer find the
way out. The gate aind the net had
been closed. Two were lost trying
desperately to get thru. The remain
three finally were forced to come to
the surface and surrender themselves.
We took them in tact—crews, submar
ines and all"

Judge Fisk is an able man and has a

MONTANA'S NEW LAW MAKES
SWEEPING CHANGE IN THE

Glasgow, Mont., Jan. 11.—Fully 300
saloons in ^Montana must go out cf
business under legislation of the last
assembly^ which became operative on
January 1. Most of the saloons af
fected haye'.licenses under which they
would bt privileged to do business
till the 4ptaeRiswn of the license year,
which is i|btyt the middle of the sum
mer, but ,^e state act nullifies such
right
Attorney General J. B. Poindexter
has given an opinion on the law that
affects saloons and bars in small towns
of less thnan 50 bonified residents.
Speaking of the construction placed
on the law, the attorney general said
he had taken the position that there
must be 50 bonafied residents living
within a quarter of a mile of the sa
loon or other place where liquor is sold
to authorize the issuance of a licer.~e
and the maintenance of a business, cr
the place must contain a hotel which
has at least 20 rooms.
The attorney general says the law
requires that the residents must have
resided in the place six months, a:. 1
that everybody, inducting babies six
months old, m$y be counted. The ho
tel must be a genuine hotel with a xeal
business retfajbing 20 rooms.
Attorney^Mneral Poindexter say*
he has heawlthere would be attempts
to evade tffiftiaw by the coastruction
of building, of 20 rooms whose pro
prietors would^ pretend to ran* hotel
business, but that enich attempts would
not succeed.. Onp pr two towns in the
state are said ta have such buildings
now in the couri» of construction, and
the attorney genaral is seeking infor
mation tohringadion.
