office of president of the Missouri Bee
Keepers Association at Columbia last
week ha completed thirteen years as
president .This record as chief exe
cutive of one of the oldest of the state
organizations of this character is one
Mr. Rouse is justly proud of and
places him among the leading auth
orities in the West regarding bees.
Thirteen year ago he was elected
vice-president of the organisation but
twelve days after the meeting the
president died and he assumed those
duties. He has made such a splendid
official the members have continued
bim in office ever since.
He was one of the organizers of the
Bee Keepers Association and never
has missed a meeting. Mr. Rouse al
ways has a prominent place on the
program as his long experience in the
business and his scientific study of it
has placed him at the front in this
field. He has thirty hives at his place
at the west end of Woodlawn.

J. F. Griffee came to Mexico in 1884

into the shoe business in their pres

MEXICO BOY PROMISES.
TO BE STAR ATHLETE
Never in the history of the McMil
lan high school has one of its star
athletes ever gained such favorable
notice or given such brilliant promise
as has Jim Tom Edmonston, who ia
at present attending Central College
Fayette. He not only made the Var
sity eleven last fall but is ntfw a mem
ber of the first basket ball team and
when spring- comes will unquestion
able be one of the regular baseball nine
In fact hia metorio success with the
Eagles has attracted state wide at-tenlion'W-did-'tha
' splendid showing
he made Thanksgiving day in Colum
bia when Central met the Blue Jays
of Westminster. Until he was in
jured on this occasion, Edmonston
promised to sweep his team to vic
tory. His work was most unusual
especially when you consider his be
ing a Freshman.
Paul J. Pirman, who writes Mis
souri college sport notes for the St
Louis Republic, had the following to
say Sunday concerning Edmonston
and his work: .
Edmonston is Promising.'
Coach C. A. Cling'enpeei of the
Central College Eagles says that
J. T. Edmonston, a Mexico boy,
gives every promise of making a
mark in athletics at the Metho
dist school. He is considered one
of the best all-round athletes
ever at Central and is rated as
the best man picked up in the
draft by the various colleges last
fall. Several other schools of the
State had "spotted" Edmonston
and had their scouts on his trail
in an effort to land him, but tho
Fayette school induced him to
enter there. He would-have been
a star in football last fall, but in
juries kept him out of the game
all season. He is an excellent
basket-ball and baseball man
and is considered the best athlete
ever produced by Mexico.
E. U. Todd, who contributes inter-
scholastic news to the same publica
tion speaks of Mr. Edmonston in the
following note: . -
. Jim Tom Edmonston of McMil
lan High at . Mexico, Gray of
Blairstown High, Ransdell of
Paris High and Broyles of T'na
High are all on the Central Col
lege basket-ball squad this year. ,
Edmonston of Mexico, in,-particular,
is expected to make good,
as he has several years' exper
ience at guard on the McMillan
fives.
McMillan has sent out many ex
cellent athletes whose records have
reflected great credit on the school
as well as their "home town" but Mr.
Edmonston unquestionably is the best
all-round man Mexico has pro
duced in years. He is a son of the
Rev. and Mrs. J. O. Edmonston, of
this city and a graduate of McMillan
1914. The. Ledger joins his many
friends in Mexico in wishing his con.
tinued success In his athletic work.

W. W. JOHNSON MET CUSTER'S
, FAMOUS "RED SCOUT"
Whitecloud, Pamunkey chief, he
returned to the hunting grounds of
his fathers according to news dis
patches. He is now at Pamunkey,
Virginia reservation, where he ex
pects to spend his last days in peace,
after troublesome career. W. W.
Johnson.of this city .while in Miles City,
Mont,, last October' buying sheep,
met this old Indian and had an inter
esting talk with him.
Whitecloud, .now 79 years old, left
Virginia In 1871, going to Fort Riley,
Kan, and later to Colorado, where he
was employed as a scout for Colonel
Joseph Hooker, of the Ninth United
States Cavalry. After serving more
than two years with Colonel Hooker,
Whitecloud was transferred to the
command of General CuBter, and led
his brigade up the Platte valley to
the battle of the Little. Big Horn.
Whitecloud,' known then as Gilrard,
escaped through the cunning of his
horse. .
Mr. Johnson met a man recently
who was with Custer shortly before
the fatal battle in which his entire
command with the exception of the
old Indian was entirely wiped out by
Red Skins. This old soldier says
Custer was very cold blooded. In
giving an instance to substantiate
this statement he told Mr. Johnson
that Custer had a man tarred and
feathered for stealing a shirt

WIRELESS IN JEFFERSON CITY
Jefferson City, Mo, Jan. 10 The
first wireless message ever sent out
of Jefferson City was transmitted
Sunday - by Hugh StephenB to his
father, Col. E. W. Stephens of Col
umbia.
The message was: "I am sending
you the first wireless message that
was ever sent from Jefferson City to
Columbia. I hope the year 1916 will
see the completion of the highway
between the two cities and the oper
ation of an electric line over it"
The wireless was handled by Willis
Corbin, a high school pupil, who is
an amateur wireless operator and was
taken at the Columbia end by a stu
dent friend.
The first long-distance telephone
message between Jefferson City and
Columbia was a conversation be
tween Col. Stephens and his son 15
years ago, and the latter was the
first to make a,n automobile trip be
tween the two places.

HARDIN COLLEGE TO GET
$250,000 ENDOWMENT
The Baptists of Missouri are pre
paring to raise $1,000,000 of which
$250,000 wilt be given to Hardin Col
lege to add to its endowment This
will place the school's finances upon
even a more solid basis than they are
today and give it ample opportunity
to make the many planned improve
ments which lack of funds has retarded.
Stephens college at Columbia will
receive $250,000 also and the remain
ing $500,000 will be given to William
Jewel College t Liberty. The fund
will be raised by a statewide cam
paign which is to start within a short
time.'
Hardin college was founded by
Governor Chas. Hardin who endowed
it in such a way that the fund has
been growing steadily each year. He
placed the school on a wife basis and
it has always had splendid men at its
head. President John W. Million has
brought the school to a place few col
leges in the West can attain and this
new fund will mean great things for
Mexico and Hardin college. -
