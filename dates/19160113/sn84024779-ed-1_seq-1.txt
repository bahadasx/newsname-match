ALBERT'«TAD
NOT GUILTY
Of the Oharge That He While A
Rural Mail Carrier at Wai
oott Stole Oheok of
SEYBM DOLLARS FROM MAIL
And Cashed it at Wyndmere. Pos
itively Identified by Caehier
MoQann
After sitting stolidly through a
long and tedious trial after lis
tening to a man positively identi.
fy him as the guilty party and
after waiting through the trying
time while the jury was out, Al
bert Rockstad of Walcott failed
to show the strain under which!
spectators' section of the court-
room Rockstad chatted with the
friends around him during the
long 40 minutes that the jury
was out. He never moved when a
deputy marshal entered and whis
pered to the court and then re
tired, to shortly re-enter with the
jury trailing behind him. He
showed nothing of the strain un
der which he was laboring while
the jury lined up in double rank
and the foreman handed District
Clerk Montgomery the written
verdict who in turn handed it to
Judge C. F. Amidon on the bench.
But when the court read, "We
find the defendant not guilty,"
Rockstad buried his face in his
hands and sobbed in the way a
strong man sobs when touched to
the quick.
Rising slowly from beside his
son the elder Rockstad touched
his boy gently o,n the shoulder
and picking up his overcoat said,
"Gome on son, let's go home,"
And it was home for the young
man—home instead of that dread
place, hemmed in by massive
stone walls at Leavenworth, Kan.,
the shadow of which has been
resting on t/he young man for a
long time.

Albert Rockstad, who is now
only 23 years of age, was indicted
on the charge of having removed
a check for $7 from a letter ad
dressed to Willie Rath of Rich
mond county and cashing it at a
bank at Wyndmcre sometime
during- the holidays of 1912-13.
There were originally live counts
in the iiidictine.nl, but when it
came, to charging I lie jury Judg
Amidon informed that body of
men that it would he impossible

at the time Rockstad was sup
posed to have cashed the checx

identified the young man as the
one who had presented the check
to him. McGann was very positive
—in fact it seemed as though he

check was sent, to young Rath and
tlie latter was on the stand and
swore that he had not received.
However, when the defense be
gan presenting its evidence there
were few if any of the spectators
who believed that Rockstad could
possibly have been the guilty par
ty. The defense proved that the
letter was addressed to Barney
and not to Walcott. and it was
further .shown that Rockstad
would have had to make a drive
of over sixty miles from 8 or 8:15
o'clock in the morning to 3:39
o'clock or thereabouts in the af
ternoon in order to get to Wynd
mere and b?®k to Walcott. The
records of Hie postoffice showed
that the young man worked every
working day. that he registered
in and out at the usual times
order to have cashed the check
and would have had to do it in
the same time that he ordinarily
took in oovering his route alone.
It was shown that he was driving
a poor team of horses that were
probably not in a condition to
make such a trip and for whom it
would have been an impossibility
to make the alleged trip in the
time specified.
In charging the jury, Judge
Amidon instructed them in de
tail, showing them some of the
ideas in his own mind for their
guidance should they care to
make use of them. He pointed out
very clearly what was meant by a
reasonable doubt. After the court
finished its instructions there
were few if any in the court room
who did not believe that Rockstad
would be found innocent of the
crime with which he was charged.
At Walcott there was a happy
reunion Saturday, between a

a grave crime wich was laid at
his door.
The case was prosecuted by U.
S. District Atty. M. A. Hildreth
and his assistant. Judge John
Carmody. Rockstad was defended
by Atorneys Purcell, Divet & Per
kins of Wahpeton.

THE MYY

MR. RET. V. E. WEAVER
Vioe Chairman of the Wyoming
State Committee Will Deliver
An Addrese Here
The Navy League of the United
States is sending a speaker to
Wahpeton in its huge and gigau
tic plan for membership, in which
the Navy League hopes to in
crease, so as to gets its plans
through Congress as easily as
possibly. Another reason for this
enterprise for membership, so
that they will be in a talking po
sition to the unlightened politi
cian, who is either in office or
seeking office, so that he will not
light against the Navy League's
program.
The Times has from time to
time published column after col
umn concerning the league and
the membership thereof and the
plans that they themselves are
after. The Rev. W. E. Weaver, a
clergyman from Douglas, Wyom
ing who is to deliver the address
here may he sincere in what he
thinks is all right, but the men
behind him are the ones that
should be watched and killed po
litically. They last week sent us
a press bulletin, telling about the
coining of Rev. Weaver to Wah
peton, and all about him. This
press notice also tells a few of
the others that belong to the Lea
gue and very wisely in their own
opinion, besides these popular
nien, just plainly state, a "host of
others". This "host of others" is
the people that should be men
tioned as members and the read
ers of the Times can readily
that the Times is strictly against
the Navy League with its present
controlling members and its hid
den plans. We are quoting a let

THE ENFORCEMENT LEA6DE
And Its Work for the Last Seven
or Eight Years in North
vj Dakota
Hon. F. L. Watkins, Superin
tendent of the North Dakota
State Enforcement league was in
Wahpeton, last Friday and in the
evening spoke in the City Hall, to
about two hundred persons, most
ly men, there being just a sprink
ling of the feminine sex.
The
meeting opened with the
singing of two songs, specially
written for the occasion, and then
Messrs. Prat her and Clip fell, ac
companied by Mrs. Prather ren
dered a very beautiful duet, and
they did it in the manner that
Wahpeton music lovers have
heard these two gentlemen do it
before. Rev. E. Duden, pastor of
the Methodist church, acted as
chairman of the meeting, and Rev.
Sewrey, pastor of the Congrega
tional church, after a few choice
remark in his usual befitting man
neY" introduced Rev. F. L. Wat
kins lo the gathering.
Rev. Watkins opened his re
marks on the beginning of law,
and told several incidents prelim
inary to the work of the Enforce
ment League of North Dakota. Mr
Watkins is a strict prohibitionist,
and said that lie like Abraham
Lincoln when in his youth had
for the tirst time, saw negro
slaves sold from the block, re
marked that if ever he had a
chance to hit slavery, he would
hit it, hard. And so with him, as
he saw the liquor traffic remarked
that if ever he had a chance to
hit the liquor traffic, he would hit
it hard.
Then Mr. Watkins started his
tpri^along. the lines of what the
Enforcement League was® doing
in I he state of North Dakota, and
told of several incidents, which
he did in splendid style to fit his
subject. Along toward the end of
the talk lie used several statis
tics, concerning places that Wah
peton people ar«? familiar with,
concerning the results of a wet
and dry town. Also at the same
time telling how intoxicating li

the pop corn all popped, and just

Many Dealere Already Say That It
Will Re Impossible to Supply
Ths Demand
Richland County farmers are
hard ma
tter to get seed corn for
ed in this immediate vicinity to
supply local needs, but it now ap
pears that corn will have to be
imported to supiply farmers in
this vicinity. Where to get it is
becoming a question.
Local dealers say they can now
furnish a limited amount, and the
price, which now stands at from
$ to $4.50 per bushel, is slated to
go much higher. The big seed
houses in the larger cities admit
that the supply is short and pre
dict that the scarcity will grow
more apparent from day to day.
Some of them are already finding
it difficult to get enough to supply
orders already in hand.
To Ihe farmer readers of the
Times, the following extracts
from an article by Prof. Holden,
corn expert, with the International
Harvester company, may prove of
interest, showing, as they do, the
best, practice to follow in select
ing seed corn. Prof. Holden says:
"Select fhe best ears, if you
have not already done so, and
siring them on binder twine and
hang up.
"Do not. store seed corn ill
barrels or boxes. It will gather
moisture and mold or freeze. Do
not store over Ihe laundry or over
the stable. Do not put immature
or freshly gathered seed corn in
a warm room, on the lloor, or in
piles. It will either sprout, or
'mould, or both. It slnmld be hung
HP at (nice, and the windows open
ed to allow the frost circulation
of air. Do not depend on the crib
for seed corn.
"One day devoted to the seed
corn, at the proper time, may be
worth more Ih:iii an entire mouth
of hard work next summer put on
a poor stand of corn.
"The attic is a good place to
hang up I In* seed corn. There
should he a circulation of air
through the room. A space three
by eight, feet, will hold -00 strings
of corn, twelve lo fifteen ears to
each siring, or about- enough to
plant -00 acres.

"If is only good business to

Ihe only way we can tell good
