Operations In Qalicia and Bessarabia
Are Discredited. :./••
London, Jan.- 13.—The news from
the eastern front of the capture of,
Sadgura is regarded in military circles
as probably true, altho official ao
nouncement has not been received.
The town, which lies a few miles
northeast of Czeinowltz, and Is a con
t'f? verging point for Ave good roads, is of
considerable importnace and previous
*S,' attempts to cap^ire It have been stout
ly resisted.
Experts say Sadgura is of more lm-
'*?.. portance than Czernowltz, because of
i, its strong neutral position.
The report from Petrograd that the
offensive In Gallcla and Bessarabia
have been suspended is regarded as
$'•r: premature. The'*'Russian offensive, it
?*„at is- believed, could hot be suspended
P/ suddenly, as It was launched with an
expected strength. The object is three
fold: to demonstrate to the Rouman
ians that the Russians can take the
initiative when they choose second, to
ijfej' divert Austro-German forces from the
Balkans and western front, and Anally,
V.
to Improve the general position of their
£v own left flank.
I, While the full effect of this Russian
fey offensive can not yet be determined,
entente military experts affirm that
the secon'4 object has been attained,

Minneapolis, Jan.
v13.—Frederick
T.
Price, a local business man, on the
witness stand in his own defense, ma-Je
a sweeping denial of the story -.old by
Charles D. Etchison, state's chief wit
ness. that Price pushed his third wife
from a cliff more than a year ago and
then crushed her head with a rwk for
the purpose of inheriting her money.
The witness repeated .the story of his
wife's death told by htm at the trial
of his suit against the city In whl:h he
iought damages because the cliff had
been left unprotected.
Price testified that the money paid
to Etchison, his former associate, since
the deatn of Mrs. Price was to aid
Etchison In business enterprises and
was not paid for silence regarding :he
alleged crime, as contended by the
.•itate. The state probably will com
plete Its case late today or early to
morrow.
M. C. Brady, chief counsel for Price,
declared that It would be shown that
Etchison had lived on money obtained
from Price, and aserted that "if Mrs.
Price was murdered. It was by Etchi
son, who believed tljat his generous
friend, Price, would be still more lib
eral when he inherited his wife's
money."
Price said he had suspected Etchison
of being addicted to the use of drugs.
"On the night of Mrs. Price's death."
the witness said. "I had stepped from
the automobile and was looking into
the hood of the machine when I heard
my wife scream, 'O Fred!'
"Etchison, who was standing near
me, said, 'Something has happened to
your wife.'
'1 hurried to the edge of the cliff and
saw her huddled up on the rocks below.
She was moaning. EHchlson and I
rushed down a steep path to her side,
and as I knelt down I found she was
still brea'thing."
"When you knelt down did you hold
a rock in your hand?"- he was asked.
"I did not."
