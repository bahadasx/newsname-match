The Chippewas of Minnesota,
upon written promises made to
them that certain reforms would
take place among them, and es
pecially upon this reservation,
voted the Democratic ticket ven
strongly during the last presiden
tial election. No reforms what
ever have been made, anJ condi
tions have grown worse, if any
thing, upon this reservation at
least. Cato Sells now has \e*-
than a year to the next election
make good the promises of the
national Democratic committee
referred to.
The forestry reservation in this
state contains some of the fines*
agricultural land that could be
found anywhere, yet it continue**
to lay idle for experimental pur
poses. The public at large are
losers by not being able to enter
upon the lands and make farms
thereon, but the Chippewas are
the greater losers because the land,
bout three hun4fed thousand]
icres wifti valGaWWeJt$^
thereon, has not been solct under
the agreement made with them in
1889. The United States, under
the Act of 1889, coded to the Chip
pewas of Minnesota all the reser
vations they were then occupying,
and then created itself a trustee
by the same act to sell this land
and pine timber for their benefit,
but instead of doing this it created
the forestry reserve referred to
without due compensation to the
Indians, and also allowed much
pine timber land to be entered un
der the homestead and pre emption
laws of the Uuited States. The
whites are now clamoring to have
the lands opened to settlement,
and the Chippewas should appeal
to Congress to do so.
C. Congdon, Sen. Xnute Nelson,
and E. E. Smith, Republican na
tional committeemen for this state,
and a host of others, will be can
didates for the nominauon of dele
gales at large to the Republican
national convention to be held at
Chicago this year. Of the per
sons above named Mr. Congdon is
the best known among the Chip
pewas, an acquaintance he formed
during his incumbency of the
office of assistant United States
district attorney for Minnesota
twenty-five to thirty-five years
ago. During Mr. Congdon's ad
ministration he established the
custom of prosecuting not Indian*
for introducing liquor into Indian
reservations, but confined himself
to the prosecution of the actual
white violaters of the law who
sold the liquor to the Indians, but
after he resigned from the office
the custom was changed. It was
also the firm of Billson & Congdon
that defended the Leech Lake
Pillager Chippewas in 1898, after
the Bear Island battle, and for
this work they charged the In
dians nothing The Chippewas of
Minnesota hhould now show their
appreciation of Mr. Congdon's
friendship to them during iheir
time of trouble by voting solidly
for him as delegate at large to the
Kepuhhcan national convention,
next March.

Vol. Xl II. White Earth, Becker County, Minnesota, Thursday, January
S.
Among the members of the sen
ate Indian committee who is al
ways on the alert against any
schemes from which Indian inter
ests might suffer, or fair dealing
generally, is Senator Page of Ver
mont.
Seuator Page is not only a prom
inent public man but a successful
one in business as well. His fath
er was engaged in the hide busi
ness as early as 1835, and retired
from it for a brief period in 1846
on account of ill health, but sub
sequently re-engaged in it. In
1864, Sen. Page, then only twenty
one years of age, bought out the
business and has remained in it
ever since then.
to be led into the old rut by
some of the subordinates of the
office, we are unable to state, but
it is charged that one or the other
of these two things is the cause of
his failure to improve conditions
among the Indians. In this con
nection the question naturally sug
gests itself, is Acting Commission
er Merritt deceiving Commission
er Sells, or is he unable to control
the ring in the Indian service?
Mr. Merritt made a statement
to the publisher of THE TOMA
HAWK two years ago, relative to
Supt. Howard, which leads us to
believe that he has been unable to
control conditions here, and possi
bly at all the other reservations
from which the Indian office has
received complaints, and, there
fore, the burden is placed upon
Commissioner Sells for not correc
ting the causes whiqh have rriade
hu administration unpopular, not
only with Congress, if our infor
mation is true, but likewise with
the Indian? of the country.

be placed in an attitude somewhat
different than that of guardians
towards minors, and their appoint
ments will be made only upon the
petitions of the majority of the
Indians who may desire them.
Information is also received to
the effect that the Indian bureau
at Washington is even more un
popular with Congress than it was
during the Valentine administra
tion. Whether this is due to the
lack of administrative ability on
the part of Commissioner Sells, or
that he has simply allowed him

try, who have been complaining
about the superintendents upon
their reservations, have as much
cause for cVmplaint as those upon

better if the Indian office were
abolished than that the causes of
complaint should continue to ex
ist.
Not only will the Sioux of South
Dakota watch anxiously the efforts
of Senator Johnson and Represen
tative Gandy to secure the passage
of the Right of Nomination Bill,
but all the Indians throughout the
country will do likewise.
Daniels Plays His Last

Shades of the Solemn and Lone
some Pines! Whare Indian trea
ties were negotiated for the pur
pose of violation and spoilation.
Now in this year of 1916, the same
gang, reincarnated, that broke
treaties for spoils, raised the ques
tion of the validity and constitu
tionality of the Clapp Law. Like
Alexander of old they weep be
cause their fields of conquest are
vanishing with the Pines and be
cause now the site of their former
operations are changing into fer
tile fields and cottage homes and
they are not wanted and don't de
rive so much spoils, but some
others get a little benefit, they
wash their hands like Pilate of old
and feign that they have twings
of conscience over the Indians'
treatment, but it is hard for this
gang to fool the people now that
are awake. Tuis same gang of
spoilators are of the same links in
a crooked system and there has
been no change in the least, but
only A clumsy attempt to disguise
their wolfish apparel. Now they
want to shed their responsibility
like a rattlesnake creeping out of
its skin. Can they do it? A

Secretary Lane May Be
Appointed Supreme
Court Justice.
Secretary Lane has been men
tioned by the public press as the
probable successor of Justice La
mar of the Supreme Court of the
United States who died recently.
No better appointment could be
made for United States Supreme
Court Justice than Secretary Lane,
and we believe we voice the senti
ments of the Indians of the coun
try/when we say we hope he will
receive the appointment although
for selfish motives they would
probably prefer to have him re
main as secretary of the interior
as he has made a remarkably good
official in behalf of Indian inter
ests.
The Minneapolis Tribune of last
Friday suggests the name of Ex
President Taft as the successor to
Justice Lamar, and states that the
country would be pleased with his
appointment. The country repu
diated Mr. Taft for president in
uncertain terras, and why should
his appointment as Supreme Court
Justice now please it? It is not
believed it would.

refer to status, Indians can only
be, either, citizens or not citizens
If they are citizens their status is
fix MI by the Constitution of the
United States. There can be no
dispute cr question as to their
rights, privileges and immunities
as such citizens. It is only when
the Indians are not citizens of the
United States or as the courts
have it "are domestic subjects,"
that any question arises or confus
ion prevails in reference to their
status or when, as the platform of
the Society of American Indians
declares, "the Indian has no defi
nite or assured status in the Na
tion, does not know who he is and
what his duties or privileges *ue."
The general allotment act of
February 8, 1887, by Section six
thereof, accorded citizenship to
the allottees* and Indians adopting
civilized life in the following Ian
guage:
*'That upon the completion of
said allotments and the patenting
of the lands to said allottees, each
and every member of the respec
tive bands or, tribes of Indians to
whom allotments have been made
shall have the benefit of and be
subject to the laws, both civil and
criminal, of the State or Territory
in which they may reside and no
Territory shall pass or enforce
any law denying any such Indian
within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the law. And every

Under this act as originally
parsed, the lands and reservations
of a great many of the Indian
tribes of the United Stites were
allotted to the members thereof
and made citizens.
But by the act of May 8, 1906,
the above section was amended
as to defer citizenship to the end
of the trust period in the follow
ing language:
Sec. 6. That at the expiration
of the trust period and when the

Indians by patent in fee, as pro
