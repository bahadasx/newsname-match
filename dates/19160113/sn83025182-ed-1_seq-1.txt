SALONIKA, December 11 —Two
huge baskets, filled with
wicker-cov
ered bottles of chlanti wine, from
among which peeped the white necks
of champagne bottles, made up our
supply of traveling provision when
our party of correspondents set out
for the Anglo-French front in Serbia.
True, indeed, there was a small pack
age for each man—boiled eggs, cold
beef with tiny paper packets of salt
and pepper—but these were so small
we were able to carry them in our
pockets.
This was an Italian scheme of pro
visions. We had left to two Italian
journalists—a newspaper man in Italy
is always a journalist—the task of
purchasing our food supply.
We didn't know, as we pulled out of
the station on a rattlv military iraln.
that we were going forward to wit
ness the beginning of an ally retreat.
Before us was Krlvolak, where the
French had fought so long and so
hard with their "seventy-fives" and
General Surrail had told us that we
should see Krlvolak and the fighting
there.
Before us was the British front,

A VISIT TO THE FRONT
BEFORE RETREAT OF ALLIES
We got out of the train at a little
railroad station on the shore of Lake
Doiran and found ourselvts In the
midst ot British troops. I've used the
name of the lake, though before we
started out we were told that we must
not mention the names of places in
our stories. But ninfe days have
changed all that. The Bulgarians have
all these places now. it is no secret.
An English captain met us.
"Have you automobiles for these
correspondents?" asked our French
lieutenant-guide.
"Not a one," said the British officer,
"unless they want to ride on this load
of hay."
He pointed to a big automobila
truck half loaded with' bales of Eng
lish hay.
Into the truck we piled, with half a
dozen English Tommies giving us
lifts. Just as we started off, they
cried, imitating a London bus conduc
tor:
"Marble Arch. Holdurn Circus,
Bank, Elephant and Castle."
It was a cockney's way of saying.
"Houston street only," or "West
Farm express."
We hadn't seen a sign of a retreat.
The British captain got on to a flno
horse and rodo along beside us. The
road skirted the lake—a circle of wa
ter three miles across—and scores oi
oddly dressed Greek and Serbian
peasants got out of our way as wa
rolled along through the mud, hugglna
our oblong seats of hay. Everywhere
were British plodding through tha
mud, riding heavy draught horses, sit
ting by roadside fires.
"Great fish in this lake." said thq
British captain, riding up behind the
motor truck. "Perch. Country'round
here famous for them. Having soma
for dinner tonight in my mess."
"These ducks ought to be good."
said one of our party, pointing to the
reeds where thousands of birds were
floating.
"Not ducks," he said, "some sort o'
blackbird. Don't know whether they're
