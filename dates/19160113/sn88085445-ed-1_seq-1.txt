Indorsed by the Professor.
Before President Angell of the Dai
versity of Michigan bad attained to bU
high position a young hopeful entering
college was recommended to his con
sideration.
"Try the boy out, professor; criticize
him and tell us both what you think,"
the parents said.
To facilitate acquaintance the pro
fessor took the boy for a walk. After
ten minutes' silence the youth ventur
ed, "Fine day. professor."
"Yes," with a faraway look-
Ten minutes more and the young
man, squirming all the time, ventured.
"This is a pleasant walk, professor."
-Yes."
For another ten minutes the matricu
inte boiled to bis bones and then blurt
ed out that he thought they might bave
rum.
"Yes." And this time the professor
went on: "Young man. we have been
wnlking together for half an bour. and
you bave said nothing which was not
commonplace and stupid."
"True." answered the boy. his wrath
passing his modesty, "and yon In
dorsed every word I said."
Then they Inughlugly shook bands,
and word went home from tbe pro
fessor that the boy was all right and
that they were great friends.
Good Reason.
At Christmas tbe children of a cer
tain English school tried to collect
money by singing carols and snatches
of hymns. Many complaints hod reach
ed the rectors cars of bands of young
sters wn nil wring through tbe first verse
of "While Shepherds Watched" and
then violently ringing the doorbell. So
he instituted Inquiries on tne next oc
casion he visited tbe school. "Why is
it " be asked, "that Instead of singing
,he hymn in a reverent way you seam
ner through one verse and then ring
the beflr Silence reigned for a short
time Then a shrill voice from a small
hoy at the back of the room was heard
"Please, sir. Ifs -cause
tbey always lets tbe dog loose at tt*
second verse-"

Prosecuting Attorney Brown has
asked City Attorney Mont fort of
Blame to notify all Blame dealers
that the punch board must go by
Jan. 21. The action was taken by
Mr. Brown, the co-operation of the
local authorities being asked simp
ly as a courtesy.
One of the be3t signs that pros
perity is about to emerge from its
hiding place Is in the fact that real
estate, both farm and city, is on the
move. During the past two weeks
SO me rare transfers have been made
which entailed large sums of money
and in a majority of cases spot cash
was paid in deals. One of the larg
est and most important transac
tions reported by real estaie men
was that of the sale of the Wilson-
Nobtee Bart dairy farm, known as
the Bridgeview farm, a short dis
tance from Bellingham, to L. P.
Bjorlie, of Minnesota. The i ousid
eration for the place, including ihe
stock and utensils, amounted to
$100,000. The land itself was he'd
at $45,000, while the equipment was
cf such a character that the price
reached the magnificent sum stated
aoove. Mr. Bjorlie, in getting this
piecer'of property, has acquired one
at the best and most profitable
firms in the whole Northwest, as it
ii stocked with nearly 150 cows of
the highest breed. The gentleman
making the purchase is a first-class
farmer, having followed that occu
pation for a number of years in ihe
Middle West, but the Western fev
er having taken hold of him he be
gan casting about and finally de
cided that Whatcom county offered
greater inducements than any local
ity on the coast, consequently l.c
staked his claims with the destinies
of tbia county. Others will follow
the gentleman, and It is expected
that through this transaction other
iarge deals will be consummated be
fore the summer is over. —Belling-

Advancement of Agri
culture Depends on
the Country
School
By JAMES W. WADSWORTR JR,
United States Senator From
New York
IBELIEVE1 BELIEVE that the next great
organized effort for the ad
vancement of agriculture and
the preservation of a thriving and
contented country population must
be directed toward the upbuilding
nf the country school. Work of this
l>rt is in line with the highest pur
pose of government, and upon its
successful accomplishment MUST
REST THE CONTINUED SUC
CESS OF OUR WONDERFUL
EXPERIMENT IN DEMOCRACY.
I am of the opinion that the cu
mulative effect of the efforts being
put forth for the advancement of
agriculture will retard and perhaps
do away with the depopulation of
the country districts.
BUT THE FARMER AND HIB
WIFE AND THEIR CHILDREN ARE
INTENSELY AMBITIOUS, AND FOR
THIS REASON THE LITTLE COUN
TRY SCHOOLHOUSE MUST MEET
THEIR REQUIREMENTS.
Cananltiiathm of ahr JJarifir pilot ana ehr Coitfirn &tra
LYNDEN, WASHINGTON, JANUARY 13, 1916
THE spirit of partisanship in many phases of* public life has taken
deep root and is one of the greatest menaces of honest, efficient
and upbuilding municipal government. We may be strong parti-
Bans in national affairs; that is natural and generally justifiable, but in
municipal affairs WE SHOULD NOT LET THE SPIRIT OF PAR
TY BUT MORAL COURAGE, MANLY INDEPENDENCE AND
CJVIC PRIDE RULE OUR ACTIONS.
The mayor must ask and secure the support of the best citizens of
all parties and must not be tempted to form a party of his own, for such
attempt always has failed nnd always will fail.
Frantic appeals to partisanship and self interest by the foes of an
honest business administration are, alas, too often successful. I trust
the day will 60on arrive when the tariff will play second fiddle in munic
ipal platforms and not be the whole orchestra; when the dollar will be
eliminated as a potent power in deciding elections; when selfishness will
be supplanted by disinterested service, cowardice by manly courage, in
difference by earnest longing to lend a helping hand.
SUPINENESS OF THE VOTER AND CORRUPTION OF THE BAL
LOT HAVE BEEN THE MAIN FACTORS IN IMPEDING AND NULLIFY
ING MUNICIPAL PROGRESS. THEY CONSTITUTE THE GRAVEST
DANGER TO OUR FREE INSTITUTIONS.
To me the ballot is the most sacred and precious secular privilege.
The voter who deliberately neglects to exercise the right of an American
freeman, who fails to cast his ballot without proper excuse, should for
repeated offenses be deprived of his citizenship.

Partisan Spirit Greatest
Menace to Honest
Municipal Government
By RUDOLPH BLANKENBURG, Mayor
of Philadelphia
MUCH MONEY SAVED ON
COUNTY HOME SUPPLIES
Bids for supplies for the county
home were opened last week by ihe
commissioners and the contract was
let to a Bellingham firm for $307.-
--71.
The following is the list of bids
made: Fisher and Isaacs, $307.71;
Farmers Mercantile Co., Lynden,
$327; Fair Grocery, $327.81; B. B.
Grocery, $328.36; W. J. Pynor,
$334.07; Brown and Cole, $337;
Ireland and Pancoast, $342.21; Lyn
den Department Store, $345.50; F.
f. Gerard, $343.60; The Golden
Rule, $352; Wilson-Nobles-Barr Co.,
$350.35; Lynden Cooperative Co.,
5359.95; Fairhaven Cash Grocery
Co., South Bellingham. $371.93;
Empire Meat and Grocery, $347.40.
Analysis of the bids develops
many interesting things. Every
L,ynden store was well under the
price asked by the Fairhaven Cash
Grocery of South Bellingham, ihe
highest bidder. This is the firm
that has been furnishing the County
Home with supplies for some
montha.
One noticeable thing about the
bids is the close figures made by the
different stores throughout iLe
Bounty in competition. Aside from
the South Bellingham bid which was
$C 4 above the winning mark, the
prices ranged within a few dollars
ot each other.
That catalogue house 3 when in
fair competition and when limited
in quality of goods to be furnished,
are undercut in price by local stores
is alse> shown by examination of ihe_
bids. This is invariably the rule
when catalogue houses can be pin
aed down to fixed specifications.
The commissioner who worked io
"A enge from the costly favoritism
system to the competitive bidding
olan is to be congratulated. On
this month'b list alone, considerable
money was saved. May the old re
gime of exhorbitant prices paid per
sonal friends which was the rule
during the past year, never return!
