Woodcraft and of the good work that
is being done by this greatest society
of its kind in existence.

will be something doing at . every
meeting. 'Let every Woodman at
tend each meeting if at all possible

EDITORS OF MENACE ON TRIAL
The people of this city and county
are watching with especial interest
the press accounts of the proceed
ings in the trial now in progress in
the Federal Court at Joplin, Mo., in
which the ed'tors of the "Menace,"
the , widely girculated anti-Gatholic
paper published at Aurora, Mo., are

MISSION STUDY CLASS
The United Mission Study Class
met with Mrs. Coile, Jan. 11, at 2:30
o'clock to discuss "An Integrating
Force." This subject was managed
so beautifully by the leader, Mrs.
Sisk that the entire class Is regrett
ing that there is only one more les
son to be discussed in 'Home. Mis
sions in Action'.
This is one of the most interest
ing lessons in the book. The aim
of the lesson "Christ is the hope of
the world, because he is the one
leader who bas in him personality
that is sufficient in wisdom, creative
power, and stability to weld a varie
gated multitude into a unity to knit
the whole human to the wbole di
vine.' .
Some of tne Questions discussed
were:
I. America, the inspirer of the
world.
II. America's present perils of dis
integration from alien immigrants,
III. Home missions as the inte
grating agent of the church.
. 1. Classes !n English.
2. Furnishing wholesome amu
sements. .
3. Christian settlements.
4. Mining camp churches.
5. Temperance meetings.
IV. - Integrating effects of home
missions.
1. Example of Welch Christ
ians in Penn.
2. The influence of the return
ing Italian immigrant.,
3. International evaangelism
through Orientals in America.
Much good for each one present
was tne result or tnis lesson. Tne
ones mising these discuslons are
missing a great . opportunity of
knowing what the different mU&ions
of the churches are doing for the
upbuilding of humanity.
The last lesson Sources of Pow
erwill be held in the First Presby
terian church on Tuesday after te
4th Sunday in Jan. We , hope o
have a large crowd present io we
can discuss a new study. . ...

NASHVILLE
Dear Editor: May I have space in
the Herald this week for a new Years
greeting to yourself and family and
all the Herald readers, and my kin-
folks and friends, one and all. I hope
you every one had the -best Christ
mas of your life, and have started
out in the New Tear hopeful and
happy, and determined by the heip at
God to make this the best year of
your life and meet trials and dlfflccl
tles each day bravely, and If your
sky is sometimes darkened by a cloud,
just take courage and say. "WeJ on
the other side the sun still shines."
And dear ones lets try ocr best to
follow the golden rule this year more
than ever before, and if we do. I feel
sure we will at the close of this year
say it has been a happy year.
As this coming year of 1916 is as
a book unread, as a song unsung, and
a story untold, we cannot tell what
it may bring forth. Some predict
that America will be drawn into the
conflict of war this year. ' Others say
it is to be year of great suffering
of variius kinds, such as accidents,
murders, etc. Bible scholars and
deep thinkers say that , the second
coming of Christ will be this year.
However, God alone knows what It
is to bring to pass, but we all do see
that this earth is all unrest and is
expecting some great thing to take
place. Well our hope Is In God,
Come what may. He doeth all things
well, and after the counsel of His
own will. '
We had an enjoyable Christmas
Our Aunt. Mrs. Nancy Grammer. of
Dennison.- Texas, visited us a few
days before Christmas. We had not
seen her for nine years, and certain
ly did enjoy her short stay with vs.
Santa Clacs was very generous to
us this time, and just to be remem
bered by those we love, and those
that love ua is the secret of the Joy,
and not Just merely to get a present,
but to know we are thought of at this
happy thne of peace and good will;
if only a card, it fills its mission.
I would love to mention every gift
and the name of each giver but it
would take up too much space, but
Just have to say that plenty of sta
tionary, stamps and pencils given by
a nephew, sister, friends and husband
Drought much gladness, as writing
has always been our chief pleasure.
One sister-in-law Bent goods for a
dress. Glad of that, to be sure. Who
ever heard of a wofan not being
proud of a new dress. From Scotta-
villa. Ky.. came a box containing wal
nuts, chestnuts, butter and dried
peaches. (Now Alpheus, I dare you
to laugh. It was the kind to make
pies with, not the kind, you ouce fool
ed me on.) Tea, and Lena sent me
the Holland Magaslne for two years.
Then there were handkerchiefs, nice
toilet soap, dental cream, soap d'sh.
by a friend in our city; also candy.
fruit, and last but not least a blue
eyed baby doll with sure enough baby
clothes, from cap to well , you all
know what a baby wears. This was
sent by Lena. Ticketed, I guess I
Well I must say that the two last
issues of the Herald were great The
contributions tor the Chr'stmastlde
by the ministers of the different
churches of Cookevllle, and Mrs. Ep

the price of the Herald. Well. wish
ing you all a prosperous New Tear,
I beg to remain a ,frend to all.

COOKEVILLE SCHOOL OF MUSIC
The third of January our Mueic
School reopened with a large number
of pupils, notwithstanding the prev
alence of grippe in town.
The beautiful gold medal offered
by one of our patrons Is proving an
incentive to more thorough work,
and an inspiration to higher attain
ments. Desiring to have our pupils actual
ly "do things", and be able anywhere
and at any time to play from memo
ry with ease and repose, we have de
cided that the medal be awarded for
the best repertoire work. In the
early stages of music study the pu
pil should be taught what a reper
toire is, that he should ' prepare such
a repertoire, and that he should keep
it in constant readiness.
One of the main missions of the
music world is to make the world
happy as well as better. The prime
object of music study is to be able
to play, no less for the pleasure or
others, than for the edification of
ourselves.
"Reviewing Is the only process
by wh'ch music, once learned, can
be, kept on the fingers; or to put it
another way, reviewing is the only
way by which those who expend
time, money, and energy In piano
study can get any return for their
outlay."
It is a very rare thing to find a pi
ano student who can play with a de
gree of accuracy, any, except the
best one or two pieces studied. How
ever good a performer you may be
and notwithstanding the great num
ber of pieces studied, the real ques
tion is, have you kept the snowledge?
Can you play your o)a pieces T Do
you keep up a systematic course o(
review? How pupils dislike that
word 'review', and yet it is highly
essential to piano playing. Keeping
what you have is more difficult than
learning something new, and requires
more patience and perseverance.
"Art is difficult to learn, and it Is,
alas, so easy to forget, and lis price
less . treasures, even when kept, will
soon corrode unless we keep polish
ing, polishing, all the time. The old
piece is like precious metal that
with every polishing renews its
beauty and lustre." Bear this In
mind and never weary of repetition
for it will bring its reward in more
ways than you can Imagine.
