BREAKING INTO PRINT"
Elcry by William Dudley Pellsy
Feature of February Adventure
' .-Vniplrs." a story of the Montana
moothills by William Dudley I'eiicy,
a member of the staff ol the Kvcning
Manner, is one of the features of the
February number of the Adventure
magazine. The leading character el'
the narrative is "'Dooly Malone." a
big framed, big berated product of
the wild and wooly country, whose
exploits, trials ami tribulations will
be di'sciibed in other i tories wlib h
the author has been engaged to cun
triimle lo future issues of the maga
zine. While ''Mooty" is the leading per
former in tlie events described in
"Scruples'- tiie story is based upon
the misfortune of. a conscientious
young westerner who is in danger of
losing his Lest girl and promised
l.ride through the machinations of a
slick individual from the effete east
whose Proadway clothes and cabaret
manners have temporarily dazzled
Iho western maid.
"Hooty" comes to the rescue. There;
is a l'u nny mock marriage scene dur
ing which the crooked character of
(he dazzlcr is unearthed by "Mooty"
who attempts to olliciate as tlie par
ron, the maiden returns to her lirst
love and even the conspirator, im
pressed by the tuagnaminity of
"Mooty," determines to lead and hon
est life.
The story is characterized through
out by humorous, breezy dialogue and
excellent description. "Mooty Mal
one" is a character in whom are em
bodied the really good attributes de
veloped in the land of magnificent,
distances, the tale is clean and whole
some and the moral is plain and true.

LITTLE NATION HARD PRESSED
Must Evidently Bow ts Foreign Con
queror For First Time In
History.
Home, Jan. 13. Italian troops ttre
likely to be dispatched to the aid of
the hard pressed Montenegrins with
in the next 4S hours. King Victor
Emmanuel today conferred with his
'.liiei's of staffs in regard to the Mon
tenegrin situation
London, Jan. Kl Fighting is going
on all around Cottlnjo, the small town
which nearly a year ago ceased to be
the scat of the Montenegrin govern
ment. Never before in the long his
tory of the little Montenegrin king
dom has it been compelled to bow to
a foreign compnTer, but there seems
little hope that it crm long withstand
the overwhelming strength cf Gener
al Kocvess in met and guns.
As in Serbia's case, tlie entente
press tintls it inexplicable why Italian
assistance- was not long ago sent to
Lovien, which. It is said, could have
been rendered impregnnble with a
comparatively small number of rein
forcements t.nd n few heavy guns.
The reduction og Montenegro, tlie
press points out, will enable Austria
not only to command the Adriatic jbut
also lo threaten the flank of any .ad
vance from SaloiKkl ami prevent any
effective move by the entente forces
through Albania.
For Italy the new Austrian success
has a most serious aspect. Tlie long,
narrow Italian ptninstila ).; pecul
iarly vulnerable to an attack from the
sea Any really gieat Austrian naval
base in the magnificent harbor of Cat
taro would have been impossible-with
out Lovien. but under the new circum
stances Austrian possession of Cat
taro is almost as great a menace to
Italy as th" German conquest of Cal
ais would have beet! to Great Britain.
While attention is c ntered on toe
developments on the Adriatic coast,
il i announced from Rome that two
Itaiian transport.--, the Briudisi and
Citla di 1'eleruio. last week struck
mines and sunk. A majority of tlie
crews were saved.
DISGUISED AS AMERICAN
British Ship Sailed Under Stars and

Bos-toil. .Jan. M According to tnem
Ixrs of the crew of the Britisli steam
ship City of Lineal:), which arrived
here today from the Far East, the
cajiain of the vessel adopted all pos
sible devices for eluding submarines
in the Mediterranean, even to display
!:ig th'; American Hag and painting

"Lincoln." Nothing was seen, how
ever, of subniei sibles and barring
tempestuous weather in the Atlantic,
the voyage was not unusual.
Big shipments of rubber and slab
tin formed important itenn of the
cargo. The vesstd brought in 4,iiiu1
tons of rubber, valued at approximate
ly SLoiiO.OOO, and 2,40U tons of tin, es
timated to be worth upward of a mil
lion dollars. The total value of the
cargo was $.1,Ot)n,Oi0. Sixty-six thous
and cases of bean oil, loaded at Dalny,
Japanese Manchuria, comprised one
of the largest shipments of the kind
ever brought here. The City of Lin
coln also had large consignments of
spices, tapioca, sago Hour, rattans
and curios.

As soon as an attack of Rheuma

Don't waste time and suffer unneces

A grateful sufferer writes: "I was
suffering for three weeks with Chro

though I tried many medicines, they
failed. Fortunately I heard of
Sloan's Liniment and after using it
three or four days am up and well.
I am employed at the biggest depart

NOTE TO CONSUL SILLIMM
Shooting of AmeTean Miners by
Bandits Denounced as a
Dastardly Crime.
El Paso, Jan. 13. Gen. Paudo and
12 Villista commanders were today
arrested mid jailed on -charges of vag
rancy, as a preventive measure to pre
serve peace along the Mexican bor
der. ,
The bodies of the IS American min
ers killed by bandits at Ysable arriv
ed here today on a train from Chihua
hua. Washington, Jan. 13 Secretary
Lansing with the approval of President
Wilson, yesterday dispatched to Con
sul Stillman at Quertaro, a note de
nouncing the slaying of Americans at
nouncing the slaying of Americans
near Chilhuahua by Mexican bandits
and calling upon the head of the de
facto government for the immediate
pursuit, capture and punishment of
the perpetrators of tho deed. The
note urged the sending of troops to
other districts where Americans were
in danger of losing their lives or prop
ejty. At the same time, tho state de
partment ordered an investigation of
the murders with a view to determin
ing whetJier they resulted from the
failure of the de facto government to
give proper protection in a section
known by it to be dangerous, or
whether the men Inst their lives as
the result of a bandit outbreak which
could not have been forseen.
Instructions to seek infomatlon
were telegraphed to consular repre
sentatives in Mexico and along the
border. In the note to Gen Carranza
the killing of the Americans was do
scribed as a dastardly crime, com
mitted in territory announced to be
in .the control of the Carranza forces.
The men were killed, Gen Carranza
was informed, because they were
Americans, after they had gone into
the country with the consent of the
Carranza military authorities.
There was no indication last night
that the I'nited States would take any
further action in the case of the
Americans slain by Villa bandits in
Mexico beyond its demand for the
apprehension" and punishment of the
outlaws; or at most to hold Gen.
Carranza responsible for tlie murders
if it is shown that his officials were
negligent in nroviding protection for
the party. Although the latest out
l age stirted the simmering Mexican
sifuarion again to the boiling point
and drew an outburst of attacks upon
the idmlnistration in Congress prob
ably unequalled since the Huerta
crisis two yenrs ago. there was no out
wanl sign that President Wilson was
being influenced to alter his policy.
A proposal by Senator Sherman of
Illinois, republican, for joint inter
vention by tlx pan-American nations
wliiih led in the recognition of Gen.
Carranza was referred without action
to the Senate foreign relations com
mittee.

Rev. II. .1. Maillett, who recently re

JOHN H. EVANS
Weil-Known Civil War Veteran Died
of Pneumonia This Morning.
John H. Evans, aged 77, who for
the past 25 years has been one of the
highly esteemed residents of Ben
nington, passed away at his home on
Main street near the Guideboard
about 2 o'clock this morning after a
ten-day illness with pneumonia.
Mr. Evans was born In Woodford,
the son of Mr. and Mrs. Ethnl Evans
and spent his early life in that town,
bis father afterward moving the fam
ily to Bennington where at the out
break of the Rebellion, John Evans
enlisted in Company A, 4th Vermont
Volunteers. There are but three
other local men now living who 'were
members of that company, Henry O.
Camp. Sheriff Fred Godfrey and Irv
ing K. Gibson. The Fourth lost more
men in the war in proportion to its
total than any other Vermont regi
ment John Evans served in the war from
1861 to 1863 and saw several severe
engagements. He was finally strick
en with typhoid near Harrison's
Landing and was ordered to a hospit
al in Philadelphia
During his confinement there he
fell in love with his nurse, Miss Mary
Sewell, who had charge of the insti
tution, and at the close of the war
they were married. They settled in
Philadelphia, in which city they lived
until Mrs. Evaus' death 20 years lat
er. Mr. and Mrs. Evans went into the
dry goods and not'ons business in the
Quaker city and surrounding towns,
running several small stores -which
were disposed of, following her death.
He engaged in the patent-right busi
ness later, but met with some re
verses and gave it up.
His second -wife was Miss Caroline
Cox of Philadelphia. who sur
vives him. Shortly after his
second marriage he moved to this
village and has been almost a con
tinual resident since. During the
past 25 years he has engaged in the
lumber business to some extent and
taken part in various enterprises
with his brothers.
Besides his widow he is survived
by two brothers, Franklin X. Evans of
Haddonfield, N. J., Calvin Evans of
this town, and two sisters. Miss Har
riet Evans of Bennington and Mrs, B.
I'ownsend of North Adams.
He had
no children.
Mr. Evans was everywhere sDoken
of as an excellent citizen and kindly
neighbor. He leaves a large circle
of friends and acquaintances in this
town and Philadelphia saddened by
his death. During his long life he

jured that there was no hope of sav
ing it. '

nary hearing before Municipal Judge
Holden and held for the grand Jury
which met in December. After a

YOUNG GIRL HURT
Received Severe Cut on Forehead In
Runaway Accident.
Miss Elma Deforge, about lo years
old and daughter of Mr. and Mrs,
John Deforge who live on the east
road to Pownal, was the victim of a
severe but not serious accident Wed
nesday afternoon. While coming
frpm the mountain with a load of
wood tho horse became unmanageable
and the young girl was thrown
violently against a sharp board on the
sled. She struck on her head in such
a manner that a deep gash was cut
nearly across the full width of her
forehead.
The girl had been to the mountain
with her brother for a small load of
wood and the accident happened on
the return trip. They had no runner
chains and the sled crowded against
the horse so that the animal was un
able to hold the load. The horse be
gan to run and the girl was thrown.
Early in the evening the girl and
her brother drove into the village and
a physician found that the scalp and
flesh had been cut clear through to
the bone. The girl refused to permit
the surgeon to take any stitches in
the wound but the injury was dressed
as well as possible with plaster and
the pair started on their return trip.
They stopped at a house in the village
and the horse bolted for home so that
it was necessary for them to make
tho remainder of the distance, all of
two miles, on foot.
