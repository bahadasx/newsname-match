By Carl W. Ackerman.
Berlin, dun. 13. The XTiiitod Press is
officially authorized to deny rumors
that the kaiser is seriously ill." His ill
ness has never been serious, officials de
clare. It was neoessnry for him to re
innin indoors nt the imperial palace on
ly a few days. He is now improved to
such nn extent that he is conferring
daily with members of the general
otnff.
The above exclusive report obtained
by the United Tress Berlin correspond-
out is tho first official word regarding
the kaiser's condition sin.ee the first
bulletin of several weeks ago saying
mat tno Kaiser was Buttering from
"cellular inflammation" and unable
ti visit the western front.
It is the first direct Berlin report

utories, originating outside of Germany,
persisted in claiming that tho kaiser
was dying.

tain capture bytho Austrians,
The subject, it is believed, was con
sidered today in tt conference to which
King Victor Kinmanuel summoned mili
tary chiefs nnd cabinet officers. It is
inown that Montenegrin affairs were
discussed.
Tho Montenegrin crown prince and
bis wife reached Fomo from Cettinje
just before King Kinmanuel arrived
from tho front after an eight monhs'
Absence from Rome. Tho prince visited
J'oroign Minister Sonnino nnd then
King Victor Emmanuel nnd presented
the appeal to tho Montenegrin king
Nicholas, for help,
It is rumored that Queen Helena,
'daughter of King Nicholas, participated
in tho conferenco and that this may
cause n startling chnngo in Balkan af
fairs. It was reported that she tele
graphed tho king alarming reports con
cerning tho Austrian invasion of Mon
tenegro which resulted in bringing him

whining solicitude that the
head was that of tho murdered

LEWIS RESOLUTION
WOULD FORCE ARMED
INTER VENTIONA TONCE
Washington, Jan. 13 Congress was
asked today to clothe Trcsident Wil
son with authorities to intervene for
cibly in Mexico.
Senator James Hamilton Lewis of Il
linois, majority whip, introduced a
resolution thus to authorize the chief
executive to use n free hand with tho
army and navy forces, to tho oxtont
that they nro now used in policing
Nicaragua and Haitil'He proposed, too,
that this power be given so that, in
case of necessity America might punish
violation of United States rights and
protect United States property.
This move, the direct outgrowth of
tho bloody slaughter of 18 Americans
at Snnta' Ysabel, it was followod by a
speech, however, In which the Illinois
legislator defended tho administra
tion's policy of patient watchful wait
ing. On the other Bide of tho capital,
there were fiery words from Kopresen
tutivo Slnyden," Texan, anont tho Mex
ican situation.
l'rcsidont Wilson, however, refused
to bo swerved for the present from his
Mexican policy, lie uphold his premier
in the latter 's announcement that tnc
Snnta Isabel victims went into Mexico
in tlio face of a warning that they
would do so at their own peril.
From Mexicna Ambassador Elisco
Arrcdondo came word to Secretary
Lansing deploring tho nssnssinations,
pledging action to revenge thorn, and
to protect Americans in tho future.
The Lewis resolution read:
Resolved, by the senate, the house
concurring, that the president be anil
hereby is authorized and empowered to
order tiie army and nnvy or any neces
sary pnrt thereof to Mexico, and there
cooperate with any forco existing,
which to the president shall seem ap
propriate, for the object of protecting
American citizens, the property of the
United States and to punish those vio
lating the securities of its citizens;
and to authorise l lie president to use
tho military and naval forces of the
United Stntes in Mexico to the same
extent as is now by law permitted to
the navy in Nicaragua and Haiti for
the protection of American rights."
l.uder the resolution, intervention in
Mexico could be complete. Tho senator
did not iudicute whether 1'resident
Wilson had requested him to introduce
this measure, but, at any rate it caused
the widest speculation or any move
since the massacre occurred.
Administration officials, in sym
pathy with the Wilson Mexican policy
ueld that, in the following mesago from
Arrcdondo, there was the prospect of
a satisfactory solution of the Mexi
can proniems without the drastic step
of intervention.
"I have the honor to acknowledge
receipt of your eicollency'i noto re
grading the murder of 10 Amorican
gvntlrmen near Chihuahua and of tho
situation In the state of Duraugo. Your
excellency may feel assured that my
government aud myself deeply deplore
the dastardly action of 'the Villa
forces, that efficient action will be
taken to bring tho murderers to justice
aud that niy government will also take
the necessary, steps , to remedy the sit
uation In Durahgo. - This latter hat al
ready been brought to the attention ot
Mr. Carranza, and while I feel certnin
that he will omit no effort to bring the
murderers to justice ot his own initia
tive, I have communicated with him
en the subject,..'

pathetic with those who attack, the

denced from heavy applauso with
whic Representative Slnyden 'a speech
was greeted.
in l'iory fashion, ho announced that
his patience is exhausted in the Mex
ican situation, and that he felt con
strained now to discuss it from the
floor.
"I have been silent even when I
thought that a serious mistake was be
ing mado in leaving tho whole matter
iu tho hnnds of the president and the
socrctary of state," he shouted. "Am
ericans hnvo been murdered singly aud
in squads, and Mexicans hnve even in
vaded our territory under military
command and have lulled nnd stolen.
"Tho border peoplo do not want war
with Mexico, but they vlo want security
for their Uvcb nnd property."
In response to the senato resolu
tion passed last wock, asking the presi
dent to give congress full facts in the
Mexican situation, particularly tho cir
cumstances surrounding recognition oi
Carranza, tho state department has re
cided to present its information nt any
early date. Tlio department has prac
tically decided upon the form that the
messages will take. The first draft
thereof is very long, but it may be
completed within u week, nnd then
President Wilson is expected to have
the last say as to its final form.
I'iueon holding will probably be the
fate of tho resolutiou Representative
Dyer of Missouri, introduced yester
day, nskinir President Wilson whether
watchful wiiiting ought not now to be
ronlaccd by armed intervention. Dyer
himself does not intend to press the
subject.

lion, tho senator himself requested that,

El Paso, Texas, Jan. 13. Carrying its death cargo of
18 plain black Mexican caskets, the funeral special on the
Mexican Northwestern railroad, arrived here today with
the eighteen American victims of Monday's Santa Ysabel
massacre. It had pulled into Juarez under the cover of
early morning darkness, and then at dawn puffed across
the river into the old Santa Fe station here.
A silent crowd of several hundred friends and rela
tives of the victims of the gruesome bandit holdup were
gathered in the station. Sorrowfully they watched the
transfer of the corpses to auto trucks piled two and
three high they were covered with a tarpaulin and drag
ged away to the morgue. 1 , -
With the arrival of the bodies, there came the full
shock of the tragedy. Gruesome stories of the massacre
were told by a Mexican witness of it, and by American
members of the rescue party who accompanied the bodies
to the border. . - , ,
These said that American friends of the murdered
men risked their own lives when they boldly rode into the
view of the marauders, and recovered the bodies. The
bandits still lurked in the vicinity of their ghastly execu
tions, as the half dozen bold American rescuers, armed,
tenderly picked up the blood soaked nude bodies and
placed them aboard the rescue special. , .
Soft nosed bullets had been used when the Mexicans
gave the Americans the "mercy shot." These tore great,
ragged holes in the men's heads, and shot a-way the skulls
of three of the party, leaving their brains oozing on the

"One was occupied by the Americans,

"No aooner hod the train been,
