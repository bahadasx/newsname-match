School Notes
Attendance during the past
week has been nearly perfect in
most of the rooms.
The primary room is over
crowded. It will be necessary to
provide more room and another
teacher in the near future. The
intermediate and upper grades,
too, have a full enrollment.
The percentage of attendance
for the fourth month was quite
low, on account of so much sick
ness during the fore part of the
month.
' Tuesday morning Mr. Edw. G.
Polster visited the different
rooms of the schools. At the
opening eiercises of the high
school he spoke upon the "Ad
vantages of a University Educa
tion." He, having been fortu
nate enough to have obtained a
college education, advised all pu
pils to take advantage of a col
lege training. He emphasized
the fact that sixty per cent of
those attending the universities
were boys and girls making their
own way through school. Again
he stated that the highest desire
of a rich man is to give his sons
a complete college education.
Mr. Rockefeller and bis son are
noted examples. The great de
mand for college men makes
known the fact that a boy or girl
should at any cost obtain a col
lege education.
Mrs. Win. Cberrey if on the
sick list this week.
Last Tuesday afternoon a small
building at Torek was blown up.
It was one of the buildings of

Geo. D.' Kelsey, died very sud
denly last Sunday morning at

Funeral services were held
Tuesday and the remains were

home on South Chouteau avenue,
on last Friday evening, follow
ing a very severe attack of la
grippe. Mrs. Dawdy was 59
years, 7 months and 29 days old.
Mrs. Dawdy was one of the
finest colored women we have
ever known. She had a big
heart. Never a mother herself,
yet she raised children who were
worthy, and it was through her
efforts that several young colored
men and women have been given
a good education and started on
the right road. Sue was a very
charitable womanand did many
acts worthy of the good Samari
tan. Funeral services were held
Sunday afternoon, and the fun
eral was very largely attended.

Mattie Patton Dead.
Miss Mattie Patton, who went
to Union Springs, Alabama, last
summer to be with her neice,
Mrs. Hugh C Moore, for a few
months, was stricken with pneu
monia about two weeks ago,
mention of which was made in
the News last weeks, died at the
home of her neice on Wednesday
evening of last week. Every ef
fort was made to save the life of
this noble woman, but all efforts
were in vain.
Deceased was born in McLean
county, 111., on August 17, 1853,
and came with her parents to
this city in the early seventies.
Her mother died when she was a
young woman, and she promised
her mother she would raise the
family and look after her father
until he passed on. This prom'
ise she religiously kept, refusing
manv offers of marriage, for she
had many suitors who realized
her sterling worth.
She kept house for her father,
four brothers and one sister, saw
all but one brother married off.
Her father died a few years ago.
Mattie Patton was one of the
finest women it has ever been
our pleasure to meet. She was
an angle of mercy in cases of
sickness or distress, and the
weather was never too bad, or
the night too dark for her to
visit the sick or distressed. She
is as sure to reap the reward
promised to the consistent Chris
tian as the sun is sure to rise
tomorrow morning.
The remains were brought to
this city for interment. Funeral
services were held last Sunday
afternoon at the home of B. W.
Patton, conducted by Rev. Hoop
ingarner, and interment was
made in Baxter cemetery. A
very large number of sorrowing
f riends attended the last sad rites.
Four brothers and one sister
survive her. They are B. W.
and M. A. Patton of this city;
J. S. Patton of Kansas City; W.
L. Patton of Raton, N. M.; Mrs.
Anna Goodner of Albuquerque,
