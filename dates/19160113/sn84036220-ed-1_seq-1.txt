The Accusation.
The accusation, as It is termed, pre
sented by the grand jury along with
the indictments and the final reports,
is .against Ira B. Kirkland, city at
torney. It Is a very voluminous docu
ment, covering 24 typewritten pages.
The nature of it can be best under
stood by presenting the following pre
liminary statement:
"Comes now the duly drawn, sum
moned, empaneled and sworn grand

NOBLE8 OF ALGERIA TEMPLE
IN THI8 SECTION PLANNING
A REUNION.
WILL PROBABLY 8E ON JANUARY 20
The Idea of forming here a Sliriners
club has been discussed recently by
some members of the Shrine and,
while it is entirely uncertain as yet
whether or not such an organization
will be effected, it has led up to the
plan of having a Sliriners dinner at
some date in the near future, Thurs
day, January 20, being the time gen
erally considered as an excellent time
for It. This would afford ample time
to make the necessary preparations
and coming on the night for the com
mandery meeting would not interfere
with any other affair now known of
and the Knights Templar would, of
course, defer their meeting on that
occasion should one be contemplated
for that night.
Shriners here are so far removed
from their temple that it is only on
the occasion of the annual ceremon
ial that any of them are able to say
"howdy" to Algeria. The club would
serve to bring the nobles into closer
touch and keep interest in the Shrine
up.
At the proposed dinner the plan is
merely to have the club idea talked
over and even if it is found inexped
ient to proceed, it is sure to be a de
lightful affair—one that might well
have been given before this.
Shriners are urged to call on Illus
trious Potentate A. B. Lehman or
John W. Selden and express their
views in regard to the dinner. The
club plan will take care of itself, but
if the dinner is to take place its com
plete success must be assured in ad
vanc.
What do you think of it, Nobles?

A marriage license was issued yes

corporation in the state of Montana,
alleges that the said Ira B. Kirkland
has been guilty of wilful and corrupt
misconduct and malfeasance in office
in that he, the said Ira B. Kirkland,
while acting as city attorney for the
city of Lewistown, Fergus county,
Montana, charged, collected and re
ceived cut of the city treasury of Lew
istown, Montana, illegal fees for serv
ices rendered by him in his capacity
as city attorney of the city of Lewis
town, Fergus county, Montana, over
and above that allowed by law, and for
cause of accusations shows to this
court and alleges."
The document then goes on to set
out that Mr. Kirkland has been the
duly qualified and acting city attor
ney since May 3, 1915; that an ordin
ance duly passed and approved May
3, 1915, fixed the salary of the city
attorney at $600 a year; that there
after Mr. Kirkland, as city attorney
put in various claims for services
which were allowed and paid.
These claims are then enumerated
in detail, covering many pages and,
in conclusion, it, is set out that these
items are all for illegal fees against
the city.
In conclusion, the accusation asks
that a copy be served on the defend
ant, who will be required to appear
before the court and make answer;
that if he does not appear, the court
proceed to hear and determine the ac
cusation; that upon the appearance of
the defendant, the court set a time
and place for the trial and hearing
of the accusation and evidence in sup
port of the same, and the answer and
evidence, if any be offered, by the said
Ira B. Kirkland; that the charge here
in be declared sustained and judgment
entered that the said Ira B. Kirkland
be deprived of and removed from his
office.
Judge Ayers directed the foreman
to turn the accusation over to Coun
ty Attorney Wright and when this was
done, directed the latter official to
serve a copy as directed and that the
defendant thereafter appear before the
court to answer such accusation.
Jury Discharged.
In discharging the jury Judge Ayers
expressed his appreciation of the work
of the member. They had followed
the instructions closely and he be-'
lieved their services had been most
valuable to Fergus county. It was al
ways a guess when a grand Jury was
called, but the court was the one t,ak
lug the chance, and he was satisfied;
the court would not be blamed
uie court wouiu not ue uiameu loi
calling (his grand jury. The first four
indictments returned were sufficient
in their importance to warrant all the,
expense incurred. In those cases it
was very difficult for the county attor-1
ney to secure the evidence such as the
jury had secured in the Baker case.
He again thanked the jurors.
The Report.
Following is the final report re
turned by the grand jury:

worked out very well.
H. A. Davee, state superintendent
of public instruction, gave the address
of the afternoon. He pointed out that
Lewistown was ideally located for
normal school, and said that while
the state is in no position at this time
to establish any such institution, the
business men could go ahead and do
so, with benefit to the entire city. He
also was strong in his recommendation
of the "junior college" plan for a high
school. This is the giving of a two
years' regular college course at the ,
high school. ■

H. L. Fitton presided as chairman
and introduced Mr. Davee. The talk
by the educator was a splendid one,

WASHINGTON, Jan. 12.- Congress

soiled patience, even Senator Stone,
toct foreigners in Mexico, interven
lion was inevitable.
Tlie atmosphere was surcharged
with excitement when the senate and
house met, and the storm broke very
quickly. Senator Sherman, republl
can of Illinois, introduced a resolu
tIon to express the sense of congress
tliat there should he intervention by
the United Slates and I'an-Amertoan
nations unless General Carranza could
once with a demand that
the lives and property of
foreigners. In the house, Represents
live Dyer of Missouri offered a reso
lution asking President Wilson whetli
er he did not think the time had ar
rived to abandon "watchful waiting"
and invade Mexico. The resolutions
were not ucted upon, both being re
ferred to the foreign affairs commit
tee. Hut there was aroused iiy the
latest. Mexican atrocity a general spir
comply at
Hass
it of resentment that most conserva
tlve leaders
found difficult to restrain.
Senators Gullinger and Borah, on the
republican siilo of the chamber,
echoed tho terms of the Sherman
resolution which declared that the
Carranza government appeared power
less to cope witii the lawlessness In
Mexico and declared intervention the
mly alternative unless reparation for
the chihuahua outrages were speedily
made and the do facto government in
future allowed Itself capable of con
trolling the situation.
Senator Stone urged patriotic sup

should prove a failure.
"If Carranza proves himself inef

I think with the senator from Idaho,
Mr. Borah, that there is only one
thing to do and that is to go down
there armed and intervene."
Senator Thomas of Colorado also
advised against intervention except
as an unavoidable resort, declaring
that the United States never would
get out of Mexico if its armies once
crossed the Rio Grande. He made
vigorous speech assailing the Stand
ard Oil company and the Pearson Oil
syndicate, and charged that these in
terests, through rival efforts to mo
nopolize the oil properties in Mexico,
had been responsible for the revolu
tion of that country and for Btrife
along the border.
Senator Sherman's resolution
prompted Senator Gullinger to read
