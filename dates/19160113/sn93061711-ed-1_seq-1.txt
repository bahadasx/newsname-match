DEMOCRATS HOLD THEIR
FIRST POLITICAL MEETING
OF
DEMOCRATS MEET IN THIS CITY
AND START THEIR CAM
PAIGN STRONGLY IN FA
VOR OF COUNTY
PRIMARY
A per announcement calling the
Democrats to meet In Tucumcnri, on
Saturday morning nt ten o'clock a
numbor of the leading Democrats and
members of tho various precinct com.
mittces woro hero at tho scheduled
wmo xor opening. Nineteen or tho
22 precincts woro represented, but
the meeting was called to ordor about
eleven o'clock. It was then found
that Mr. Davidson's oflko was too
3mall for the crowd who desired to
attend and it was moved and seconded
that same should bo adjourned to be
held at tho court house- commencing
promptly at ono o'clock.
At ono o'clock tho meeting was call
ed to ordor by C. C. Davidson, county
chairman, and after selecting E. E.
winter as temporary sccrotary, Mr.
Davidson outlined his policios for tho
present and Bald this meeting was
merely to find out whether tho Demo
crats wanted n primary or conven
tion by which to choose their cnndl
dates for county offices. Ho plcnd
for harmony in tho party ranks and
paid a beautiful tribute to President
Wilson and his wise and suno admin
istrntion. Ho also spoke very highly
of tho efficient manner In which tho
county offices have been run and said
Quny county officinls woro said to
rank at tho top of tho list in tho
state.
Tho court room was comfortably
tilled with representative Democrats
and everything went oil without a
serious fight or hardly any opposi
tion. The first and really tho only
micstion, "Primary or Convention
was put beforo tho meeting and a
number gavo their views concerning
the matter.
Senator Alldredge spoke in favor
of tho convention and used as his
main reason tho thought that Quay
county should recognize tho Spanish
Americans by giving them a placo
on tho county ticket and figured that
would be the only way a Spanish
American stood any show to gain a
nomination in this county where tho
majority of the voters nro so strong
ly English-spcnking people. He made
an excellent talk in favor of the con
vention plan and it seemed for a time
that that was the only plausible way
toavold making up a ticket wholly
composed of English-speaking citi
zens. Patricio Sanchez, committee
man from Rovuelto or precinct No. 2,
then spoke along the same lines and
nsked that tho Spanish-Americans be
recognized this year. A number of
other committeemen made shore talks
and most of them stated that their
precincts were nearly unnnimously in
favor of a primary, but tho solution
of tho problem was not reached by
tho primary supporters until C. W.
White of Rnnn precinct mndo an ex
tended talk in favor of tho primary
and nmong other things ho said ar
rangements could bo madu whereby
cortain offices could bo set apart for
tho Spannish-Amcricans and no English-American
would be allowed to
announco for said ofllce. This would
guarantee that tho Spanish-Americans
would receive proper recognition nt
tho hands of the Dei ocratlc party.
Mr. White declared he was heartily
in favor of tho old saying, "equal
rights to all, and special privileges to
nono."
Col. Reaves of Endce made a short
talk in favor of tho primary and said
that was tho only way whereby tho
common man would have his say in
who should fill tho offices of tho coun
ty. He believes in weighing each
candidate.' in tho .balance and then
supporting tho i who is tho most
competent to fiU said office with dig
nity nnd honor.
A. E. Dillingsloy was another speak
er who poureoThot shot into tho con
vention plan of selecting candidates.
He said tho sharpers, tricksters and
professional politicians manipulated
things to suit themselves nnd used
tho common "guy" as a tool to fur
ther their own personal interests.
There was no voto taken in the mnt-
ter as it was so plainly ovldon. 'that
the primary plan was in tho mu
ity
Tho date of tho primary will f
sot untlt tho convention is held
bo
lect delegates to tho state convent
which will bo hold somo timo in Juno.
A committeo of three composed of
MoBors White, Lowenstern nnd San
chez, was selected to got up suitable
rules to govern, Iho primary so that
it will be mndo safer than tho ono
held five years ago.
After the 'precinct committee moot
ing had adjourned n mass meeting
was called and J. H. Welch, of For
rest chosen as chairman, with A. R.
Moses secretary. A resolution was
read by II. 0. Norrls of Houso, en-
1916 CAMPAIGN
doming tho enndidacy of Judge J.. D.
Cutlip for tho oflko of district at
torney of tho Eighth Judicial District
which was adopted in full.
Following is tho resolution as ad
opted at tho mass meeting:

FINE STALLION
H. L. Cox, who owns and lives on
a nice farm near Jordan, N. M., ar
rived in Tucumcnri last Friday from
Chariton, Iowa, where he had been to
buy a fine draft stallion for use on
his farm. Tho stallion is a fine binck
Percheron with a small white sUir
in his foichcnd. Ho is not yet three
years old but weighs about 1550. Ho
was owned and bred by Frank Chnn-
dlcr, nt Chariton, Iown, who is known
to all farmers who have kept post
ed on thorough-bred horses of nil
kinds and especially in tho draft class.
The horse attracted quite a bit of
attention on tho streets Saturday be
fore Mr. Cox left for his homo,
Mr. Cox and his son, E. R., are tho
joint owners of this fine horse and
expect to stand him nt their places
near Jordan tho coming season.
This class of horses is what will
bring our present grado up to a bet
tor and mora marketable size, and
there is no country on earth where
horses will do any better than New
Mexico. This is a natural horse and
cattlo country nnd we aro glad to sco
tho farmers taking so much interest
n grading up their stuff.

SHOT IN AMARILLO. TI
As the result of a shooting affray
which took placo in Amarillo Mon-
day, Howard Urown, who formerly
lived in Tucumcnri, but now n dairy
man in that city, was seriously wound
ed and Leo Ynnsicklc, brother of Gary
Vansickle, well known hero because
of the trial and conviction for tho
killing of Doug. Anderson, nnd wan
afterwards released, who formerly
lived with his parents near San Jon,
gave himself up to a friend and was
taken to tho county jail in Amnrillo.
It is said that Urown, driving his
milk wagon, and Vansickle, driving
along Sixth strcot, mot on thnt street
and tho shooting followed. Vansickle
shot Brown with n shot gun loaded
with buck shot, afterwards trying to
finish him with a six-shooter.
Railroad men say Brown was com
pletely perforated with shot nnd the
chances for his recovery were very
sum. vansickle refuses to talk of
the affair and no reason for the shoot
ing has been given.
Mr. Brown's wife was visiting her
parents, Mr. and Mrs. Perdue, who
livo out near tho Mesa Rodondo. A
message was received in this city that
evening and Chas. Adair drove out in
his auto and brought Mrs. Brown to
town in timo to catch tho train for
Amnrillo that night. Tho report re
eelved at that timo stated that they
did not think Brown could livo until
the arrival of his wife.
STOCKMEN'S GUARANTY LOAN
CO. KKADY FOR BUSINESS
Albuquerque, N. M Jan. 12. A
meeting of tho stockholders of tho
Stockmen's Guaranty Loan Company,
organization of which has been under
wny for the past year, has been call
ed at the company's offices in its homo
ofllce building here on Jan. 22., when
n board of fifteen directors will bo
chosen to assume tho guidanco of the
companys extensive business opera
lions, co-operating with tho officers
who will be elected s the same meet
Ing. Success for rtfis company menns
important advantages for tho live
stock interests of New Mexico, since
tho company's purpose will bo the
negotiating of livo stock loans, sccur
ing the capital in eastern money cen
tors and relieving the stock growing
interests of the state of tho handicap
ol the old borrowing conditions.
Tho .Stockmen's Guaranty Loan Co,
a co-operativo organization of stock
men, originated under the laws of
Now Mexico with an authorized cap!
tal stock of $500,000 fills almost ex
actly the demands voiced over and
over again by leading stockmen of the
southwest, for a live-stock loan bnnk
which will be organized for and pro
pared to' give quick and low rate ac
commodation to large and small live
stock operations when properly se
cured. Whllo tho company will in no
sense do a blinking business, it will
bring its stockholders '.ito close touch
with large sources of monoy nnd its
operations will have the effect of
bringing large sums of foreign capl
tal into the state, as well as to keep
at home tho huge .sums of money
which New Mexico stock interests, di
rectly and indirectly, send out of
this state ovcry year in the form of
interest on their financial accommo
dations.
A. G. Whitticr, New Mexico state
traveling auditor, has just mado pub
lie a report covering a scrutinizing
examination of tho affairs of tho
company, mado December 4-0. in
which ho gives the company a clear
bill of financial stability, finding In
his conclusions that the company's
plan of operations is sound, that the
company is on a thoroughly solvent
basis, and that its officors are build
ing a corporation which should work
for the good of the state. Copies of
tho report which have iiecn printed In
tho Albuquerque papers, show it to
be one of tho strongest bills of health
over given a now corporation in New
Mexico. Tho report is of special in
terest since it shows that tho cotnpnny
by assuming direct supervision of its
stock salesmen and full control of its
fiscal agent, have corrected tho only
source of complnint against it. W. C.
Ocstrcich, the president and other
men directly interested in its organi
zation stand high in the Albuquerque
financial community, nnd the company
will begin its active career undor vory
favorable conditions for service to the
ivo stock interests and to tho de
velopment of the state,

QUAY
COUNTY
A BLACK EYE
RACE QUESTION CAUSES MANY
WILD ACCUSATIONS AND IT
MAY HAVE BEEN THE
CAUSE OF THE FOL
LOWING ITEM
GRAND JURY WORK
A case before the justice of the
pence in western Quay county has
been brought to tho attention of Ln
Voz Publica. It seems thnt Scgundo
Snlas made complaint beforo the Mon
toyn justice ngnlnst Enrl Elliott foi
assault and battery and also a peaci
complaint. The case was taken be
foro tho I nut justice on a chnngo of
venue. When tho case was ready for
trial before this justico tho complain
ing witness reports thnt the attorney
for tho defendant nnd his friends,
present in Inrgo numbers, mndo dem
onstrations in the court room intimi
dating tho prosecuting witness and
tho court. Whereupon the court dis
missed both cases without examining
n singlo witness nnd assessed the
costs against the prosecuting witness,
togothor with the attorney's fco for
tho defendant.
If this statement of facts is true,
then tho grand jury should investi
gate this case.
This seems to be only ono more of
many Instances that have arisen in
Quay county, whero the ugly race feel
ing has shown itself. La Voz Publica
January 1.1, 1910
Editor La Voz Publico,
Santa Rosa, N. I' ex.
Dear Sir:
My nttcntion has just been called
to an article in your paper under" date
of December 31, 1915, headed "Grand
Jury Work," which outside of the
facts that a complaint was filed and a
change of venuo taken, docs not coti
tain a word of truth.
The facts arc that Scgundo Salas
filed a complaint in a peace proceed
ing in the Justico court of Montoyn
On tho day set for hearing n difficulty
urose between the pnrtics at Montoyn
and after the difficulty wns over, the
parties appeared beforo tho justice,
plead guilty and paid their fines?
proper application, in writing and
sworn to, wns then filed with the jus
ticc at Montoyn for a change of ven
uo in the pence proceeding r.iid in the
cases growing out of tho difficulty at
Montoyn, nnd on tho showing therein
mndo tho justico granted a change of
venue to the nearest adjoining pre
cinct, which was Imn, New Mexico.
On tho day set for hearing all par
tics appeared with their witnesses and
the witnesses were duly sworn nnd
gavo their testimony. Tho complain
ing witness, Scgundo Salas, when tes
tifying in tho court, denied that he
had ever sworn to tho complaint in
the pence proceeding nnd attempted
nt first to deny his signature to the
complaint, but afterwards admitted it
was his signature but stated that he
did not accuse Earl Elliott of the
items set forth in tho complaint. Nat
urally there was nothing for tho Jus
tico to do but dismiss the complaint
and ns the malicious intent of tho pros
ccuting witness wns so apparent, he
assessed the costs against him, but
did not assess tho attorney's feos or
nny items that nro contrary to tho al
lowance by Stntuto.
In tho enso of assault and battery
against Enrl Elliott, it appeared that
he had plead guilty to this charge and
pnld his fino and tho complaint had
been filed in error and tho enso was dis
missed by Vie prosecuting witness
himself.
As to tho charge that Earl Elliott
appeared beforo tho justico with a
largo number of friends nnd that they
together with myself, intimidated the
Justico, I wish to stato that the only
friends of Mr. Elliott nppearing at
tho he, ring were witness In tho enso
and I know thnt tho many friends of
Mr. B. L. Moncufl, tho justico of the
penco, will bear mo out in tho state
ment that any man or body of men
that would attempt to Intimidate him,
in his own Court, would be attempt-
ng to do tho impossible.
I wish to state again thnt tho wit
nesses in the caso were sworn, that
nearly a dozen witnosses testified on
both sides; that a very competent In
terpreter was provided and that every
word spoken in tho case was corrcct-
y interpreted from Spanish into En
glish and from English into Spanish,
and that thereforo tho information
given you is willfully false.
Of course, I realize thnt your ar
ticle is merely printed for political ef
fect. Wo, of Quay county, find that
nt every Convention of cither party
told in the Western part of tho stato,
charges are brought against tho peo
ple of this county to tho effect that
they do not treat tho native people
fairly and that we do not like the na
tive people. No single instance of
unfairness has ever been brought un
ana proven to ray knowledge, the
charges aro always based upon tho
wiki vnporings and untruthful state
ments of someone, ns in this instance,
but the residents of this county get
migniy urcd or hnving these chnrgos
brought against them. At tho last
meeting of tho legislnturo similar
charges were brought against tho
pie of the Montoyn Precinct, but they
were refuted by the signatures of ev
ery bpnnish speaking person In tho
precinct.
I do not care to go into the evidence
in the cave under discussion, as I un
derstand an appeal is to bo taken to
the district court, but I am perfectly
willing to leave the moril,s of tho mat
ter to tho discretion of the Court nnd
jury as to whether or not tho com
plaining witness hns been imposed up
on in any way. I trust you will sec
fit to give this letter tho snmo proml
nonco that you gave tho article In
question. Yours very truly.

adopting tho slmro ns a career, she
appeared in the principal role of Chas
Klein's "Daughters of Men" nnd Chan
ning Pollock's "Little Grey Lady." In
1907 eight years after her first ap

an entirely new vogue in dramatic
acting by her fino portrayal of the
title role in Henry Savage's great

HOME-MADE CHEESE

his neighbors. If his plans work out
all right ho will easily make enough
to supply Tucumcnri stores and nil
other stores in the county with this
fine cheese. Mr. Bruco says ho is
now handicapped by not hnving the
necossnry machinery to manufacture
his product, but if the mnchino will
mnko it any better we know ho will
find n ready salo for all he can make.
Thoro is nothing much better for

REPORTS

CARI'S FUTURE
OFFICES OF ROCK ISLAND It. R.
MAY HE MOVED TO TUCUM
CARI FROM DALHART
MANY REPORTS ARE
AFLOAT
Word has been received In this
city as well as all along tho lino thnt
iticumcari hns been chosen as tho
most central point for tho Rock Island
to locate its general offices, nnd wu
understand thnt all tho officials now
located in Dnlhart nnd Amnrillo will
bo transferred to Tucumcnri within a
short time.
Tho head of the Rock Island line
is cutting off snlaricd men nnd will
use tho money saved In improving the
MS KS
present equipment. The superintend-
and two nro now required to do tho
work formerly done by three. Nntur
ally this will cut down tho clerical
force and flavo considerable in the
courso of n year.
It is said arrangements will bo mndo
with tho E. P. & S. W. to enlnrgo the
shops bore so that more workmen will
bo put to work nnd tho R. I. will con
tract with this compnny to do nil its
repair work on this end of tho line.
In speaking of this move a promi
nent railroad man told tho News edi
tor thnt if such a change was mado it
would bo necessary to build an offico
building, thereforo it is quite proba
ble a new depot would also be built
In connection with it.
This is no pipe dream but some
livo town is going to bo benefited by
tho change whllo soveral towns nlong
tho lino will suffer tho loss. Tucum
cnri hns all tho advantages ncccsBary
to make this tho logical point to con
centrate and tho citizens (not just tho
business men) should got busy and
find out just how much our town is
entitled to and then go after it teeth
nnd too-nnils.
Just because wo have a few dead
ones who holler "Wc can't" every timo
something worth whiio bobs up, is
no reason wo should not try. Cnn't
means "won't" nothing more nor less.
Tho Rock Island people have nlwnya
been friendly to Tucumcnri, because
they originated tho town and prac
tically mado it what it is and had not
tho Mexican war interfered, Tucum
cnri would not have stopped growing,
but would have been much lnrgcr and
still growing rapidly. Wo now have
tho best railroad facilities of any town
in tho state. Whllo our rates are not
yet fixed satisfactorily they will bo
and then fnctorics nnd other institu
tions ncccsBury to mnke a city will
be forthcoming.
Tho railroad owners like to be nsk
ed to do things because they know
they nro appreciated. Those that ask
'hall receive may bo as truo from a
business stnndpoint ns it was in tho
scriptures, but a dead man or dend
town never nsks for anything, there
foro they receive nothing.
UNIVERSITY ENROLLMENT
SATISFACTORY TO PRESIDENT
Albuquerque, N. M., Jan. 12 En
rollment of students at tho New Mex
ico Stato University for the second
semestor, which begun Jan. 4, total
ed 220 at tho end of tho first wool;,
an increase of 24 over tho total en
rollment of tho first half year period.
and of more than fifty over the total
enrollment of last year. It is an in
crease of one hundred per cent over
that of two years ago. Tho Incrcnso
in the Bccond semester's enrollment
Is especially gratifying to tho Uni
versity government nnd Its president,
sinco it was largely a voluntary in
crease. With the University dormi
tories well filled nnd additional cot
tages for students being built, no spc-
cial effort wns mode to induce new
students to enter for tho second hulf
year period. Tho voluntcors prove
tho growing influence of tho Univer
sity and tho new students give rep
resentation in tho student body from
ovory county in the state for tho first
timo sinco tho University wns estab
lished. Conservative estimates predict a
freshman class of 100 or moro for
next year and a total enrollment that
will bo well over 300.
