Most of these men are residents of

any extended comment upon them.
They are men that the people trust,
and will insure the bank's popularity
in the future as inhe past. The nrin

prominent lawyer of Clarion, Mr. Gee.
Stephens, well known as the owner of

Capital Reduced to $700
It was decided to reduce the capital
stock from $12o,000 to $75,000, and to
eliminate the real estate and insurance
departments of the bank, thus cutting
! down tne running expenses. This will
enable the officers to devote their
whole time and energy to banking.
The affairs of the bank have just

To Avoid Taking Cold.
How shall we avoid taking cold? To
begin with, lead the physiological life,
ir the advice' of a well-known physi
cian. Get up; in good time; bathe
well; eat three meals of wholesome
food a day, and don't hurry about It.
Be in the fresh air all the time, day
and night; and get in the sunshine
whenever you can, and it isn't too hoi.

And the secretary should have nothing
whatever to do with-the collecting of

I say that no man can conduct tho af
fairs of a club properly when t'ne club
pays him no regular salary, nor fur
nishes' adequate means -for the carry
ing on of the work. Hand-to-mouth
methods won't do. . ,
- "Better no club than one fore-ortlsin
ed to. failure. I believe."
