BALCH'S GRAVE
.IS NEAR LYLE
AUTHOR RESTS NEAR LOVED SCENES
life Story of Young Minister Who Wrote
"The Bridge of The Gods" is .
Aa Appealing One
In a little rural graveyard not far
irom Lyie, Klickitat couulv. Washing
ton, ia lb burying plaw of Fredreic
homer Balch, who as the author ot
"Tne Bridge of tbe Goda, "(a romance
dealing who Indian legendary tales,
has made for hiaaelt a nam in tbe
history ot northwestern literature. Not
iar Irom tne gorge of bia inspiring Co
lumbia and in tbe eastern . foothills of
bis beloved Cascades, the body of tbe
pioneer writer bus tound tbe Ions tail
ing place, and perchance the spirit of
tbe youthful drtemer still contemplates
tbe scenes of aaiural wonder tnat so
tnnlled biin during life.
Wben one really interested in bio'
neer life of Oregon and of the legends
of ibe inoians of tbe Columbia river
communities reada of tbe life story of
homer Batch and of his early dealb at
tbe age of BO years, be cannot belp
reeling tnat a loss came to tbe litera
ture of the state wben Atrupos wielded
too early ber abeara and cupped toe
tnread ol tbe young mau l lite.
It ia intensely appealing, tbis story
of tbe das ot young mauuood of tbe
nan woo wrote "the Briuge of tne
uoda." freueric Huuier buicb was
sett educated, he spent less than a
year attending scbooi. for six moulds
in 1876, wueo the family resided on a
farm owned by Jaoiee A. balch, tbe
fatuer of the author, in tbe Mount la
our community, tne lov was a student
at acnoul taught by 1. K. Coon, wbo
later moved to tne buod Kiver valley.
Alter a few moutna ot study at tbe
ra-.inc Theological seminary, at Oak
auu, Cain., in 1869, ne waa toictd : to
teiuru 10 Uiegou Uccauae, ot illness. .
otcfeUe ot . ine poor bkuiin ot the
u.oiuer lue lazily u,utu liom Mount
tuoot to ouiuet.uuU, utre tnty nau
totuteily lived. Miur a anon teai
uence ineie iney removed to Lyie.
vbile young Balch was a dreamer, be
a by no means an idler. Work was
scarce in tbe eaily days, but be founu
employment in bia boynood riding tbe
tatige of the souinern Wasninglun
cuuniiy. lu the solitude ot tne great
suelcnes Willi tbe great peaks ol tbe
Cascades to . iupue mm, ne felt the
uist gnawing ot au ambition to tell lov
wiy of tne muuiiiams ano tne river
in nooks of romance. . Ibe impulses ot
a gemus bad atureo wiluin biui before
ibe ianiiiy lett tne Willamette vulUy,
and in bia duty ia found jutted tbe fol
lowing: '
"lo make Oregon as famous aa Scott
made ficoiland; to make the Cascades
us widely known us me Highlands; to
make tbe splendid scenery ot toe Wil
lamette a background tor romance full
ot passion aud grandeur, grow mote
oiiu mure into lue one cberiaued ambi
tion ol my lite."
Wbile toe family was living at Lyie
young Ualcb, eager to make money, ae
curto a joo aa an ordmaty laborer in
toe construction ot tbe O. K. & N.
company's line, which was then being
pushed to completion along in suum
uank of tbe Columbia. During tbe
uaylignt hours, according to bia sister,
Mrs. James W. lugalls, of tbia city,
young Batch worked bard at manual
tabor, wielding pick and shovel. But
tne late buuis ot nigbt were spent in
leading and rereading tbe atones ot
acult and Dickens, and the essays of
ttiacaulay. And be waa trying bis own
nand and mind at sketching out ro
mances of tbe Oregon country.
Even before tbe family bad moved
trom tbe Willamette valley the young
man bad written a romance built from
pioneer history. "nsllulsb," the
lory was culled. It was later reviato
and given tbe title of "Uenevieve."
tbe book, however, has never been
published. Young Balch also began
unotner story, wnicb he called "Keu
asket." he made a sacrifice of the
manuscript of Walinlab when, obeying
toe desiiea of bis mother, be decided lu
enter the ministry.
Prom tbe stories that are told of this
period of tbe young man'a lite by bis
sister, tbe young romanticist must
nave undergone tbe keenest agony.
With the decision made to enter tb
work of a minister, young Balcb's con
science, impelled tby be more I'uritamc
standaios of early day morals, told bim
that it would be a sort ol a sacrilege
to preach the gospel ot Christ and e
tbe same time continue the writing of
stories. "Wallulah, which has been
ueclared meritorious by readers capable
of judging, was burned, and Frederic
homer Balch became an itinerant
missionary preacher of the Congrega
tional church. After serving for a
time as traveling minister in tne mid
Columbia district he waa.given bis first
pastorate in 1885, wben be took charge
uf tbe work ot tbe church at hood
Kiver. No church edifice bad been
erected, and it waa through tbe person
ality of tne young minister and through
bia instrumentality tnat the secono
local church, now ki.owu aa tbe Valley
Christian church, waa Jjuili, At the
same time Mr. Belcu was engaged in
preaching for tbe congregation of
White Salmon, just across the Colum
bia from tbe Uood Kiver vslley.
Despite bis resolutions to cease writ
ins romances, tbe young minister,
much of whose.; work s among tbe
Indians, never lost an opportunity to
learn from tbero the atones of legends.
These he baa embodied so well in "Ibe
Bridge ot the Coda."
It is said that most great writers
reach tbeir moments of climas wnile
writing tneir life history. It waa true,
indeed, ot young balch; for "ibe
Bridee ot tbe Uoda" teally tella tbe
atoty of the sacrifice Of the young min
ister. Cecil Gray, the hero of "The Bridge
of tbe Gods," who sacrificed hie life to
teach tbe Indiana the religion of Christ,
despite tbe advice of members of his
fsmily and of bia congregation, typifies
rredtrick homer Balch. Ibe young
minister, suffering because ot dictates
of a sensitive conscience, is tbe proto
type of tbe minister of Colonial days,
who offered up bia entire being and
plunged away from homa and civilisa
tion into tbe dense aod nnknowp wil
derness. But the spell of romantic literature
waa too strong for young Balch, and
afer deciding that be could continue
consistently as a minister aod at tbe
same time write of tbe dreams that
wart daily bia, be completed "The
Bridge of the Gods" st tbe age of 25
years. Drawing on bia fund of Indian
lesenda. he told the story ot Cecil Gray
and Immortalised the legend of the
areat masses of basalt that rear them
selves on either bank of tbe Columbia
at Cascade Locks. Thia atory of tbe
mighty bridge that spanned the Wauna
is now well known to tbe resders of tbe
entire Doited Statea; for "Tbe Bridge
of tbe Goda" is now in its eighteenth
edition.
"Tbe Bridge of the Gods" waa given
ita greatest prominence and publicity
in 1911, when, as a spectacular drama.
it waa presented at tba Astoria centen
nial exposition. The drama, for tbe
most part ia tbe open air. with tbe
bills in the resr of tbe city at tbe
mouth of tbe Columbia aa . a unique
background, waa ataged under tne di
rection of Miss. Mabel Farris. . "Tbe
Bridge of the Gods" waa later played
in Multnomah Held in Portland, and at
terwarda Miss Farria presented the
drama at Oklahoma city, Okla.
Both parents of Frederick Homer
Balch were pioneera of Oregon, both
baving crossed the plains irom Indiana,
Tbe mother, Miss Harriet M. Snider,
the adopted daughter or Dr. and Mra.
Robert Crawford, arrived with ber foe
ter parents in 1862. Ibey formerly re
sided in the White River community of
Indiana. Miss Snider's mother and
Milton Wright, 'atber ot tbe noted avl
atora and aeroplane inventors, Wilbur
snd Orville Wright, were second cous
ins.
The father, Jamea A. Balch, was
born at Sullivan, lnd. he attended
Wabash College, aod for a number of
years was a student of law. James A
Balch arrived in Oregon in 1861. Both
he. and bia future wife settled in the
Willamette valley near Lebanon, and it
was here that tbey were married. 1 tie
author of "Tbe Bridge of the Gods"
waa born at Lebanon, December 14,
1861.
From 1864 to 1866 James A. Balch
served aa lieutenant of Company F. of
tbe Eighth regiment. Oregon Volun
leers, whitb waa stationed on the fron
tier. Wbile he bsd been a student of
the law, he never applied for admission
to tbe bar. nor did be ever practice. A
large portion ot his pioneer life wss
devoted to teaching. When the family
tesided at Goloendale he aerved as
county judge ot Knckitat county,
freouic homer Bulch leaves sur
viving a Bister, Mrs. J. W. lngals, of
this city, and a brother, Herbert Balch,
now a resident of southern California.
On September 26, 1908, the members
of the Old rort Da lea Historical soci
ety convened at tbe handsome little
structure on the hills of Lyie and for
mally dedicated tbe balch scnoolbouse.
Following the dedication of tba acbool
building a monument which bad been
erected, to the young author was dedi
cated. Not far from both ia reared tbe
little churcb of the community, a large
share of the carpenter , work baving

could not down he baa woven a stury
and written a book that will ever be a
greater monument to hia genius and
the indomitable energy that pos

friends may erect to bis memory.
At the dedication service the follow
ing poem, written by the young auth
or's first teacher, T. R. Coon, was
read:
How clear tbe sun comes over tbe hills
And casts long shadows for a while
On rocks and plains, on lakea and rills,
While songs ot larks the morning tills,
lo praise the grsnd old bills of Lyie.
Eternal seem these hills of green
When springtime verdure paints each
pile
Of mountain height and level sheen;
But summer's sun transforms tbe
scene
And gives tbe great brown bills of
Lyie.
Fsir Wauna flows beneath the wall
And murmura as past the isle
Of M ems loose, tbe Indian's sll
When life haa flown, and mighty pall
Hides now, from him tbe billa of Lyie.
The Red Man comes, the Red Men goes,
And Wsuna's flood flows on tbe while.
Ibe white men builds as best he knows.
But red or white, the dsy must close,
And darkness claims the bills ot Lyie.
Behold the double tracks of steel
Ibst bind the river's every mile;
How vain the sense of rest to feel
Wben barge and stesmer, strong of
keel.
Pass by to vex tbe bills of Lyie.
For those are but tbe tokens ill
01 men's mad race for lucre vile.
Give me tbe cottage by the bill
With orchard fair and man a good will
Among tbe sun kissed bills of lyie.
And let me dresm of agea flown
Wben cliffs met clifl in massive style
And shore to shore tbe arch n ade one
By "Bridge of Goda," eternal atone,
That joined mayhap the billa of Lyie.
The legends old, the Bed Man's lore
Thst poet's vision lives tbe wbile
Wben rocka eternal live no more
lo mark the path that goda of yore
Once trod among the billa of Lyie. ,
Here'a Bakb's spirit bowed in payer
Mid Nature' charms and heaven's
amilea
And ssng of Genevieve tbe Fair,
No more with bim in lire to sbsre
Earth 'a joya among tbe bills of Lyie.
And here tbe mound of earth ia abown
And granite rock to mark awhile ,
The poet'a aabea 'oesth tbe stone.
he bore the cross but not tne crown
Among tba sacred billa of Lyie.
The Bridge of Tim shall be no more.
But human bearta made liee Irom
suite
Sball feel no peine en any ahore, .
And this my life shall keep lnJtore
Sweet thoughts of , the blest bills of
Lyie.
"Lift up mine eyes onto the hills."
From all below and una rest awhile ;
Be free, my soul, from all thine ills.
Look up and live, for God ao wills.
And these are bia brown billa of Lyie.

(CLUB MEETING
WEUjATTENDED
PLANS FOR 1916 ARE OUTLINED
Does of Country Members Are Cat in
Half Butler is Hopeful Over Out
come of Highway
With the tersest number of members
present st a meeting during the past
two yeara on Monday night, the Com
mercial club waa given a stimulus for
active participation in local devevlop
rnent during the coming year. One of
the first sets of the club members at
the initial meeting of the New Year
was to adopt an amndment to the by
laws of the orgsnisation cutting the
membership dues of country members
from the regular assessment of $12 per
year to $6. By this action the Com
mercial .club plans to become the hub
for activities not only of city people
and a few interested rural residents,
but of the entire valley.
A motion, providing for meetings in
tbe following rural districts, was car
ried: Psrkdsle, Pine Grove, Odell snd
Oak Grove. According to the plans at
lesst 76 memhers of the Commercial
club will attend these proposed meet
ings, snd while the program will be
filled with musical numbers snd other
things ot a lighter vein, an effort will
be made to explain to the orchsrdiets
the work for the future proposed by
tbe organisation.
"We wish to show every man in the
county," ssys R. E. Scott, "that the
city of Hood River cannot exist and
prosper without a development of the
entire valley, that every betterment in
the country will result directly in a
benefit to the business bouses of tbe
city.
"Better roads to Hood River's points
of scenic interest,' will be a slogan for
tbe club during 1916. As wss pointed
out by E O Bluncbsr. to draw motor
tourists from Portland snd other reign
boring cities, it will be necessary that
passable oa'is be extended to such
places ss Lost Lake ana the base of
Mount Hood. 1 he club will center en
deavors in securing tbe completion of
the partially finished road to Lost
Lake.
As a result in tbe cut in the rates cf
dues for rursl members, 18 applications
have already been received by the club.
It is expected thst more then 60 new
members will be sdded aa a result of
the decreased dues.
On M nday evening, January 24, the
club will give the first of a series of
social evenings for the members of the
the orgsnisation and their wives and
lady friends. The assembly hall will
b clesied for dancing and the parlors
will be prepared for card playing. Re-,
freshments will be served. All mem
bers planning on attending the meeting
are requested to notify the secretary.
The anxiety that has been felt among
Hood River citizens over the recent
letter received by County Judge Stan
ton from E. I. Csntine, Btste highway
engineer, was expressed bv Dr. J. M.
Wsugh, who asked for information ss
to the status of the Columbia river
highway, Mr. Cantine's letter having
stated thst hereafter the county would
be expected to pay costs of upkeep and
maintenance.
Leslie Butler, a member of tbe ad
visory board or the Mate Highway
Commission, who was present at the
meeting, wbile he declared that he .
knew nothing of tbe Commission's ac
tion except what he bad gathered from
Mr. Cantine's letter, said that be did
not believe thst local people need worry
over the status or the Columbia river
highway. Mr. Butler thinks that
eventually tbe state will take over the
road, but that such a step is impossible
at present because of lack of funds at
the disposal of the commission.
Because of slides during the past
winter, the CoJumLis river highway at
the present time is impassable through
hood Kiver county. While the county
court does net look fsvorably on tbe
letter received from Mr. Cantine, they
will proceed to clear the route in time
to sccommodate the spring automobile
trsfflc.
FIRE DAMAGE CASE
WILL COME HERE
Rarlevnt JnHsa Wnluartnn nf Pnrt.
Isnd, bss remanded the CBse of vf. H.
snd U. L. Rowntree vs. the Mt. Hood
Rsilroad Company and Chas. I. Early
to the local circuit court for a hearing.
Ibe esse arises out of a forest tire,
which, according to allegations of the
plaintiffs, waa started last summer be
cause of carelessness of the defendant
company, and which caused the de
struction of valuable timber and apple
trees. Messrs. Rowntree are suing for
$3,600.
Ibe complaint wss riled in the locsl
court. However, the attorneys fur tbe
defendsnt company, R. C. Smith snd
Huntington & Wilson, the latter or
Portland, petitioned that tbe cass be
removed to tbe federal court, on the
ground tbat the rsilway company wss
a foreign corporation. It was contest
ed by the plaintiff s sttorney, Judge
Derby, tbst since Mi. cariy, managing
officer of tbe company, wss a resident
of Hood Kiver county, tbe local court
would have jurisdiction. The defend
ant's reply to thia wss thst sn sger.t
of a corporation could not be sued for a
non-feassnce, tbst it was necessary
that mia-feaaance or direct misconduct
be shown. By the ruling of Judge
Wolverton. however, in accord with the
contention made by tbe plaintiff, such
a doctrine l not applicable In consider
ation of the agent's failure to ect, or
hia non-feasance, with respect to third
partiea. wbile it may have an effect aa
between tbe agent and his principsl.
Ice Ties Up Tahoma at Cape Horn
The People's Nsvigstion Co.'s river
stesmer, Ishoma, became tied op in
tbe ice near Cape Horn last Fndsy.
She wss en route from Tbe Dalles.
While the service of the Hood River-
Wbite Salmon ferry system wss retard
ed for four hours last rriday morning
wbile ice was being cut near tit bank
ot tbe Columbis, no other interruptions
bav occurred.
"Unlea w are compelled to tie op
later," aaya Commodore Dean, "this
will mske tbe third winter thst we
bav operated despite ice in tbe river."
