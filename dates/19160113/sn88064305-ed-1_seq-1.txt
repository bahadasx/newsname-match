ý0 Obituary.
Just as the rosy morning was
0 beginning to dawn last Wednes
) day, the innocent guileless spirit
0 of Aunt Rinda Knight took its
0 flight to that better world where
no sorrow or pain can ever
b reach her. The idol of the
10 hearts of those who were near
d and dear to her. The passing
away of a pioneer mo;
ther has left a void that can
never be filled. It is inscruta
ble Providence that takes away
one to whom life beckons with the
irresistable spirit of hope and
, expectancy and who has entwin
ed her personality about the
hearts and affections pf others
to whom she was the embodi
e mentof hope promise and pro
* tection. And yet it should not
f. be strange that so lovely a
* flower, a mother, should be
plucked; for a monument of in
fluence with its sweet arroma,
will be transferred in its great
; est charm through some other
t. life to the palace of the King.
r, There to bloom in endless glory
t and all to bask in the sunshine
of eternal blihss. Aunt Rinda
has gone away. She was lent
Sto this world for the ripe old
I ge of four score and ten and
*now she has gone home to be
' with the Master who called her,
t one whoshe put her trust in
. and learned to love years ago,
and realized no one could come
' to him unless they became as
r little children. Her life was a
d vendication to those who loved
Sher most and fond memories
,will ever linger around their
hearts and be a sacred treasure
tothem. Her life was bedecked
* with brave and gracious deeds
and her influence remains as a
I monument to beckon friends
and loved ones to meet her in
that sweet home where peace
r* and love shall reign forever. All
n the gems of love must be blight
d ed by the frost of time and death'
ne But we bow in submission to
is God's plan and bear up on the
r. faith He has planted in the hu
yman soul if His will at the los.
