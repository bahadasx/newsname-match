EL PASO, Jan. 13.?A report was
current In Chihuahua that ten
American men and two English ;
women had been killed by Villa
troops at Madera, Chihuahua, according
to Americans who arrived
here early today with the bodies of j
the eighteen Americans who were ;
killed Monday.
The report, however, could not be
confirmed. One of the women reported
killed was said to be the wife
of Captain Jack Lestbrldge, retired
British army officer, who, with an
" tl-t- -I
rmgusil woman uuiupaniuu, a ,ui?.
Berry, had been staying at Babrlcora
ranch, the Hearst property.
The bodies of the eighteen Americans
killed Monday by Mexican bandits
near Santa Ysabel. western Chihuahua,
reached El Paso early today
and were taken In charge by undertakers,
preparatory to sending them
to relatives In various parts of the
country.
The body of Joseph Enders, reported
to have been killed, was not
among those arriving today.
P. E. Stevenson, secretary of the !
Mining and Smelters Men Association.
of Chihuahua, who organized
the party that recovered the bodies,
said that the heads were almost
blown off.
"The wore stripped of clothing
before being dragged out of the cars
and killed," said Stevenson. "When I
we arrived at the scene of the massacre
a Carrnnza guard remained at I
Santa Yasabel, where we found a!
number of the bandidts encamped, i
We returned to the troop train to get j
a machine gun and then proceeded to
the place where the bodies were
heaped."
An expedition which left Chihuahua
City to recover the bodies of the nine-'
^ teen slain Americans were Informed
by the station agent at Santa Ysabel
that Benjamin Snell and Frank Woods
passed there bound west half an hour:
after the Watson train was reported!
in trouble. The station agent said he
warned the two men to return but they j
said they feared no trouble. Nothing l
later was heard of the party and it is
believed that they met the fate of the1
Watson train.
Mexican officials at Juarez were
unable to confirm the reports that j
ten Americans and two English;
women hail bepn murdered at Ma- j
dera. They said troops were being
despatched to that place.

While the full effect of this RuHHinn
