wanted by the local police depart

lieved to have been connected with
the Muessel-Chrobot murders on the
night of Dec. 30, had been found up
to late Thursday afternoon. Circu
lars which were issued Wednesday
by Chief of Police Millard I Kerr
relative to the double slaying at the
Muesscl Erewing Co. office and upon
which was the picture and descrip
tion of Gillen, had failed to pro
duce any results.
The report that Rurnett Karharski,
alias "The Jack Rabbit," another
polce character, was believed to be
connected with the Muessel-Chrobot
case was denied Thursday by Chiefs
Kuespert and Kerr who said that
Karharskl had been arrested as a
suspect but was discharged on Jan.

Kuespert and Kerr refused to
comment upon the reports printed
Wednesday that füllen with two
other men had been seen on the
Three-Eye tracks near the Muessel
Erewing Co., on the day of the dou
ble slaying. Their only statement
was that the person or persons giv
ing them the information regarding
Gillen were considered unreliable
sources of information but did not
deny that such information as was
printed was in the hands of the de
partment. "We have very little on Gillen and
nothing on Karharski," declared
Chief of Detectives Kuespert. "Rut
we want to either eliminate or in
criminate Gillen, There is some
question as to whether he was in
South Rend, as is alleged, and this
we must clear up. Our source of
information did not say that Kar
harski was one of the men seen with
Gillen on the day of the murder."
It was intimated by Kuespert and
Kerr Thursday morning that the ef
fort to capture the murderers of
Muessel and Chrobot was being in
terfered with by other parties and
Kuespert stated that the police de
partment was handicapped by this
alleged interference.

International News Service:
LONDON, Jan. 112. Official an
nouncement of a more stringenet
blockade of Germany by England is
expected within the next 10 days.
Developments of prime Importance
which will probably have a strong
bearing upon the United States, are
believed to be Imminent.
In the wake of the speech of Wal
ter Runciman, president of the
board of trade, that England is de
termined to exert still greater pres
sure to "starve out and strangle
Germany," have come reports that
the Rritish government is on the
point of adopting a new policy.
It is possible that England will cut
off all shipments of "contraband
merchandise" from the Scandinavian
countries except on certain condi
tions. It is openly charged in the news
papers that much of the merchan
dise shipped into Sweden, Denmark
and Holland during the past year has
found its way into Germany.
International News Service:
ROME, Jan.. 13. Montenegro
is to be evacuated by Serbian troops,
it was officially announced today at
the Serbian legation.
The Serbian soldiers that retreat
ed Into Montenegro when Serbia was
overrun by Austro-German and Bul
garian armies, are to be sent to the
Greek island of Corfu, where a new
army will be organized and equipped.
Corfu has already been seized by
the French, despite protests of the
Greek government, according to ad
vices from Athens. The French Mag
has been hoisted over the villa on
Corfu owned by Emperor William,
Artillery is being mounted on the
grounds to repel Austrian warships.
Reports that the German and Bul
garian forces on the Greek border
have started an offensive with a
great bombardment with heavy guns
still lack confirmation. The impres
sion prevails here that the Anglo
French positions are so far removed
from the boundary that they could
not be reached with German and
Bulgarian guns unless the Teutonic
allies actually advanced into Greece.
Montenegro Capital Totters.
Cettinje. the capital of Montenegro,
now seems likely to suffer the fate
of Belgrade, and British observers
are already asking anxiously what
menace the Austrian conquest of
Montenegro Is likely to hold over
the allies at Salonika!
Fighting is going on all around
Cettinje. the small town which near
ly a year ago ceased to be the seat
of the Montenegrin government.
Never before in the long history of
the little Montenegrin kingdom has
it been compelled to bow to a for

the overwhelming strength of Gen. !
Koevess in men and guns.

Small Riot is
Staged During
Peace Meeting
International News Service:
THE HAGUE. Jan. 13. 111 feeling
which arose last evening during a
peace mass meeting under the aus
pices of the Ford pacifists, was still
in evidence today.
The mass meeting nearly broke up
in a riot when Johan Ilollenberg, a
Danish delegate to the peace con
clave, charged the French with
atrocities upon the Germans.
The charge was followed by cries
of "lies." and "you are speaking
pro-German lies."
It was nearly five minutes before
order was restored.
John D. Barry, one of the Amer

of "Ford is nothing but a man with
money." Mr. Barry replied:
"Yes, but he is putting that money
to good use."

Mrs. Möhr Accused of Murder
Receives Her First Ser
ious Setback.
International News Service:
PROVIDENCE. R. I., Jan. 13.
Mrs. Elizabeth Frances Möhr, per
haps the most nonchalant woman
ever the central figure in a sensa
tional murder trial, received her first
serious setback today.
The prosecution scored heavily
when Justice Stearns, over the pro
longed protests of the defense law
yers, struck to his tentative ruling
of late yesterday and said he would
permit Chief Inspector William F.
O'Neill, of the Providence police, to
tell the jury the details of the alleged
statements of the negroes, Brown
and Spellman, that Mrs. Möhr prom
ised them $5.000 to put her hus
band, Dr. Charles Franklin Möhr,
out of the way. O'Neill, during a
preliminary examination in the ab
sence of the jury, when Mrs. Mohr's
attorneys were contesting the admis
sibility of the statements, said that
they were never signed.
The statements of the negroes
which had been since repudiated by
Spellman and Brown, who said they
were tricked, coerced and starved
i!to making them, dealt not so much
with the shooting of Möhr and the
defendant's woman rival for his af
fections as with the negotiations.
Mrs. Mohr was alleged to have CJir
ried on with them to procure the
murder.

EL PASO. Texas. Jan. 13. Fol
lowing closely upon Monday's mas
sacre of 17 Americans and one Can
adian in Mexico, word was received
here today from Chihuahua City that
nine more Americans, including an
American woman, and one English
woman have been killed by follow
ers of Francisco Villa at Madera.
The latest massacre was reported
to be the work of former Villa sol
diers, acting under orders of Gen.
Jose Rodriguez, who recently issued
a proclamation saying he would kill
Every American who fell into his
hands.
The special death train, braring
the bullet-riddled corpses of the
Americans slain on Monday at Santa
Ysabel, arrived in Juarez at l:3r
o'clock this morning and after a
short delay crossed the Rio Grande
to the Santa Fe freight yards where
the bodies were removed.
Death Sixxial Arrives.
Accompanying the bodies was an
armed escort of four American. that
had cone out from Chihuahua City
to recover them. The "death spec
ial" was followed by a troop train
filled with Carranzista soldiers.
The arrival here of the victims of
the massacre Inflamed still higher
the intense feeling which has been
growing ever since news of the
massacre was first received.
Military guards on the bridge
across which the bodies were borne
were doubled upon orders from Gen.
John Perishing, F. S. A., and extra
squads of policemen were on duty
throughout the city all night to put
down any outbreaks or anti-Mex-i
ca n de m o n st ra tion s.
Croups of weeping relatives await
ed anxiously for the arrival of the
death train. As rapidly as the bodies
were taken from the train they
were turned over to undertakers
without any red tape or formality.
Corp-es Mutilated.
The corpses were terribly mutila
ted, showing that the victims had
not only been shot, but had been
cut and staid. ed. The body of C. R.
Watson had been decapitated with a
bayonet and a long search was
necessary before the head was
found.
Fro.-h details of the massacre were
received here with the death train.
These showed th;it the Mexican
bandits had exercised the most fiend
ish brutality in putting their help
less victims to death.
Here is the story of the massacre
as gathered from persons who wit

No sooner had the words left hli
mouth than a shot rang out and W.
D. Pearce fell back in his seat with
a stream of pain. He had been shot
through the body.
The real nature of the foray now
