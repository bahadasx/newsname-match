COMMUNICATED.
January 8th, 1916.
Editor of The Enterprise,
In your issue of January 6th I
note an article by John L. Elliott,
referring to the recent actionof the
city council in passing an ordinance
preventing minors being in and
about pool halls, approving the same
and suggesting the necessity of rest
room for the people from the cohn
try,and a place where the young mne
ofý our community can meet for so
ciable enjoyment and improvement.
I hereby agree with Mr. Elliott
that every town should have such a
pace, but it seems that Mr. Elliott
is not informed as to the conditions
existing in Malta, as it is known to
everyone that the city council of
Malta has provided such a room in
the front room of the first floor of
the Varney building which is well
fitted with tables and chairs, light
and heat, and open at 6Cll times td
the general public, except when used
by the city council two or three
evenings a month, and that this
room is now, and has been used
since August 15th, 1915, by any in
dividuals, associations or organiza
tion or ladies with children, from
the country, at any time.
The business men use it for their
meetings, the firemen, the Equity
association , and the Ladies' club,
and if the young men and boys of
our town and vicinity desire a place
as indicated by Mr. Elliott, there
could be no more suitable place
than this room, which is always
open to them the same as others,
and any citizens of our community
can assist in this matter by leaving
in this room any periodicals or mag
azines or other proper reading mat
ter for the use of the general pub
lic and personally I will assist the
young men in any manner I. can
toward forming a social club and
reading room.
Very respectfully,
B. W. BROCKWAY,
Mayor.
MALTA SCHOOL NOTES
The report for the month ending
December 24th, 1915, follows:
Enrollment, boys 125, girls 140;
total enrollment 265; entered b3
transfer 10; ie-entered 66; total en
tries 341. Dismissals: dropped bh
transfer 15; dropped by other caus
es 109; total dropped 124. Sub
tracting the toal dropped from total
entries and 217 is left as the present
enrollment.
The month just closed was ver3
fair as to attendance and punctuali
ty. In attendance the per cent was
91.8, which is 4 per cent below the
mark for the year. In punctualit3
the percentage dropped 1.2 points
The rank of the rooms in attendancE
is Miss Coughlin Miss Ayer Miss
MacArthur, Miss Remore, Miss
Hakes and high school. The punc
tuality rankings are Miss MacArthui
Miss-Remore, high school, Miss Ayei
Miss Hakes, Miss Coughlin. This
shows Miss MacArthur's room tc
have have the best combined record
with Miss Ayers' and Miss Remore's
rooms, second. It is strange that
the high school made but a slight
better mark than the first grade
and were not even as faithful or as
punctual as Miss Coughlin's second
grade.
Owing to the severe coldness of
the weather some difficulty is being
encountered in keeping the school
house warm. On Wednesday of this
week the up stairs rooms were dis
mised at the morning recess. It
not be a crime if parents kept their
children at home on 50 degree below
mornings.
Many cases of frozen ears, hands,
feet, etc., come to notice among the
children. Yesterday (Wednesday)
morning each teacher spent a great
deal of time undoing the work of J.
Frost. The most serious case was
that of John (arland, who froze a
foot quite badly.
The steropticon arrived a short
time since. P'ans rre being made
to give an entertainment lecture
Friday. January p8th. More details
next week.
BASKEIT U AT,T4 GAMES
The basket hell boys took, per
he.ps, the last trin of the season on
Friday and Sqaturday of the past
week. Chinook and Havre were the
onnonents Tn both games the boys
suffered a one-sided defeat. The
rThinook game ended 49 to 17, and
the Havre game stood 56 to 21,when
time was called. In both games
they met n'a.yera of far more experi
ence. This a, the exnlanation of the
failure to win.
The Chinook game on Friday
evening was fast. The Malta boys
cot the lead eariv in the enmo hut
were unable to hold it. The floor
was long an, this was a detrmient
to the boys who ha.d but 9, feet in
which to nractice for the game. The
Cbhinook rnme was rather rough, but
it was ulite lean.
At Hayvre the coulrt was fine, and
the boys on the Havre team were
nhout of 'llal weight. RT'edes long
or experience on the Part of Havre,
"nnr defense work on the Part of the
Mlrin tenm Was resnonsible for the
'nas to I-Tavre In the first half
Havre snored 33 noints to 6 for Mal
ta. In the second half the Malta,
boys rallied, holding Havre to 24
.nints. while they secured 15 for
themselves,
Puhe Malta boys again won the
cinerp e nrnise of the players and
o(R' by their game playing. They
played a fast, clean game and
Sh i little signs of confusion.
Thel. ave established an eviable
oept on and it is to be hoped that
in ti.e uture this reputation will be
ptttajttied, and that strangers will be
jutified in their opinions, because of
the.l hgh character which the boys
may Possess. To gain this repute
is, .Woth many victories.
At both places, w)here they played
the teams were royally entertained.
While defeat has been frequent, this
first attempt on the part of the Malta
high sdhool to establislh definite in
teztschblsstic relations with the
neighboring high schools has been
Very shuccessful.
No particular star can be named
in the 'above games. All played hard
and well. The players, wiho showed
the greatest progress was Russell
Richai'dson, who, playing at forward
made most of the points in the
Havlre' game. Burner Survant
played the usual aggresive game and
showed marked ability as captain.
In both, games Norman Stubblefield
played against a hard man to handle
For the most part he succeeded in
giving his opponent strong' oppo
sition. George Robinson played a
steady game at guard, and at Chi
nook shot his only basket for the
season. Arthur Partridge, Harwood
Brown and Teddy Rustin the alter
nate choices for the fifth position,
played their parts well. Especially
pleasing was the ability shown by.
Teddy Rustin in these, his first
games.
Everywhere they have gone this
year the team played have expressed
a sincere desire to meet Malta on her
home floor. It was the saddest part
of the trips to say that it was im
possible. We hope that the time is
not far distant when we may both
entertain the other high school
teams, but that we may also give
the home folks a chance to witness
a first class athletic contest.
An interscholastic track meet has
been promised for the Milk River
valley. With its central location.
Malta would he a good place to hold
it. It would require the support of
the citizens of the community. If
this were assured there would be
no reason why the high sc.ool
should not extend the invitation to
such a tournament which would
bring hundreds of visitors to this
city.
