" Iondon, Jan. la The news from
the Eastern front of the capture of
Badaguera is regarded in inilitary
circles as probably true although offi
cial announcement, on the subject has
not-been received.. The town, which
lies a few miles to the northeast of
Czernowitas "and is a converging point
for five good' roads,, is of considerable
strategic importance and previous at
tempts to:-capture it have found it
stautly resisted by the Austrians. Ex
perts say Sadaguera is really of more
importance than Czernowitz on ac
count of its stronger natural position
and the greater facilities which it of
fers for communication purposes.:;
The report from Petrograd that the
offensive in Oalicia and Bessarabia
had been -suspended for the present is
regarded! as at least premature. The

YESGrkrilfiTED FOR
v STRATFORD F. Oi JOB
Through the efficiency of the Bertil
lon system connected with uearly ev

one of . theinost desperate postoffice
robbersand safe blowers in the East
is believed by the police to have been
discovered in James Roach, now in
the Fairfield County jail, awaiting
trial in the superior court on the
charge of burglarizing, the drug
store of William G. Hamilton a. 283
Noble avenue, fibout a month ago.
On viewing the . Bertillon photo
graph of Roich at" police headquarters
State Policeman liowe H. Wheeler to
day said that it. is his belief that the
prisoner is one of the gang of bandits
that blew the safe in the Stratford
postoffice a short time ago.
' Superintendent Eugene Birming
ham received the Bertillon picture
and record of Itoach yesterday from
the police authorities of Philadelphia
and was asked to hold the prisoner
for the authorities of that place as
he is wanted there for blowing a safe
in a post office in a suburb of the city.

that in one school of the ,city today

With ' the pandemic ' exactly one
month- old, it gives1 no evidence of
abating, as far as can- be learned.
Whereas, some physicians note th
fact that in- the last 10 Cdays the
number -sof cases ion their; hands has
increased 10 per cent.- Many of the
druggists declare that there is less
-buying of patented cough medicines
Whether this is due ' to the growing
fath in physicians as opposed to ad
vertised cures, or to a falling off in
the number of victims, the druggists
are unable to say.
Two physicians are . ill with the
grip. Dr. J. W. "Wright, the former
head of the ' Galen hospital and Dr.
W., Lee Weadon, are confined to their
beds. - Dr. Weadon has been ill for
10 days, but he is. expected to be
improved today.
The. cold wave that was looked for
by physicians to rout tpe grip germs

Because of the damp, weather this

Simon Lake, submarine builder, has
bought from George C. Edwards a
tract of 43 acres of undeveloped land
north of the New Haven road's ap
proach to the railroad bridge over the
Housatonic river, in Stratford. .
; Numerous reports as to the signill-
cance or- the deal were current in
realty circles today. Several were- to.
the effect that Lake was acting as In
termediary. Beyond admitting that
the sale had been made; Mr. Edwards
declined to divulge the . details. He
aaid that when the- deeas werd filed
the identity of the owners would be
come public property.
. Another realty deal which has been
connected, by rumor, with ie - Ed
wards sale, involves 63 acres owned
by D. C. Wood. This is the site of
the . encampment of state militia, not
f ar ' from the river, when the sham
war of the" Blues and the Reds inter
ested this section.
The Edwards tract" recently was
sought by Waterbury manufacturers
who contenjplated "erecting storage
sheds and docks for the reception f
goods shipped by water through Longson Hospital here today for the re
Island Sound and Housatonic river. I moval of adenoids and enlarged ton-
Simon Lake was reported to be in

cal Bertillon bureau. ' ".. : '
Federal authorities have been in
this city for the last two days In an
effort to get a clue to the identity
and whereabouts of the gang of ban
dits that, blew the Stratford safe and
they now believe that they are on
the righ trail.
Roach will be put through a rigid
cross- examination after he is tried
in the superior court, in an endeavor
to connect htm with - the Stratford
job. Should this effort prove unsuc
cessful he will be returned, to the
Philadelphia authorities and there
prosecuted for a safe-cracking job al
leged to have been performed there.
The Bertillon card connects Roach
with a similar job in Philadelphia
about two years ago.
At the time of Roach's arrest in
this city policemen said they detect
ed him in . the act of robbing Hamil
ton's drug store at 28 3 Noble avenue.
In his possession were found a quan
tity of U. ' S. pastage stamps, which
were missing from the isub-station.
This is a Federal offense. -
