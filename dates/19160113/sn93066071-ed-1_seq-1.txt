day January 8tli, as a result of burns
reaelved in a gasoline explosion sever
al weeks ago. The "awful tragedy
which befell Mr. Hell and family, who

bo remembered by readers of the
Herald.
Mrs. Bell wa burned to death in
the explosion, tho youngest child died
a few hours later and Mr. liell and the
