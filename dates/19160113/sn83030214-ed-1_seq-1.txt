LANSING ON THE MEXICAN MURDERS
MESSAGK TO CARRANZA.
Washington, Jan. 12.- -Following is the text of
Secretary Lansing's communication to Consul Silli
man. at Queretaro, for presentation to General Car
ranza:
"On January 10 C. K Watson, chairman of the
Mine and Smelter Operators' Association, of Chi
huahua, and the general manager of the Cosihui
rachic Mining Company, with fifteen ?it his a-*
ates, all representative Americans, while en route
from Chihuahua to their mine at Cosihuirachi-:
were taken off the train forty miles west of Chi?
huahua City by bands operating un?ier the direc
tion ol General Villa, stripped naked and drlib
eiately shot and Willed. Their bodies are bem;,
brought to El Paso.
"It is stated these men were murdered because
they were Americans, and were killed in accord?
ance with the general policy publicly anr.oumed re?
cently by Villa. This atroi ions act occur red within
a lew miles of Chihuahua City, in territory an
nounced t< be in control 'f the Carranza for.es
The Villa bands roaming about in Western Chi?
huahua publicly threaten all Americans with death
and destruction "f their property Following the
o, . ii| at,, n ol Chihuahua by Obies. ?n'a forces, many
Americans returned to Chihuahua to resume opera?
nds, with the COI enl "t the military authorities
of the de facto . ? CI ment.
"Urgently bring the foregoing to the attention
of General Carrai', . ,i I request that he order im?
mediate and efficient pursuit, capture and punish?
ment of the perpetrators ol the dastardly crime
aiiove mentioned Ai ? ? r*- irnmediate
di .pat'b of adequate I to the vari us mining
?i t!ie State Chil
eat to ' ?..ken."
9TATEMENT TO AMERICANS.
Washington. Jan. 12.?Secretary Lansing issued
to-day the following statement:
In October ?he department sent the strongest
kind of instructions to the consuls in the states of
Chihuahua srid Sonora, calling upon them to use
every means in their power to persuade Americans
to leave immediately for United States territory,
and these consuls were instructed to employ spe
i inl ri'ieri to carry this message to Americans
located in isolated sections. A few came out.
Some, regardless of the disturbed eruditions ex?
isting in Mexico, did not heed the warning.
"It was only two or three weeks ago that Villa
detained thirty Americans in the very district in
which the unfortunate Americans now reported
killed met their death. Great alarm was fei?- for
the safety of these thirty Americans. Recently the
Villistas are said to have stated tha? they woul I
kill Americans m Chihuahua territory in order tj
fop e American intervention.
"Within the last week or ten days three emrloye-s
of the Hearst ranch in Chihuahua, near the place
where Americans are now reported slain, were re
ported to have been executed Two of these three
employes made their appearance at Fl Paso some
'lays ago. but the third appears to have been kille 1.
"The department feels that it took every possible
precaution to prevent Americans from exposing
their lives in a region where guerilla warfare is in
progress, it is to be deplored that its advice w*s
nor followed.
"Fvety step will be taken to see that the per] a
trators of this dastardly crime are apprehended and
punished."
