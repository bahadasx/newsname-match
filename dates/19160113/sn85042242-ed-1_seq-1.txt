Chicago, Jan. 12.—The greater part
of the central west was in the throes
of a big storm tonight, having its
origin in the southwest nearly 24
hours before, and travelling rapid­
ly northward and eastward until the
area from the Rockies to the Lakes,
and from Canada to Kansas and Ar­
kansas was feeling the effects. Jn
some sections, sleet and rain, and in
others snow and wind of high'velocity
and in others intense cold in the wake
of the storm, caused not only discom­
fort to residents, but serious inter­
ruption of traffic.
Falling temperature in the storm or
WEATHER COLDEST
Forty Degrees Below Zeio Reg­
istered at Government Observ­
atory Yesterday.
For the first time in thirteen years,
North Dakota has experienced a real
old-time spell of cold weather. The
extreme cold has interfered greatly
with railroad traffic and many trains
are reported hours behind their sche­
dule. Frequently freight trains freeze
up and block the line, thus setting
back the other trains.
All Business At Standstill.
In every community the cold has
produced ill effects upon business
and many of the people have been
unable to get to town on account' of
the severity of the weather. Busi­
ness men report that trade during
the last few days has fallen greatly,
but that it is due only to the sudden­
ness with which the cold wave ar­
rived. The people are not suffering
as nearly everywhere ample time had
been given for preparation for the
cold spell.
Cpld Wave General.
The cold wave lias hit many places
far apart, and other cities and coun­
tries have fared far worse than North
Dakota, |The, following report receiv
ed at the local weather observatory
gives some interesting facts.
Lowest Was -58.
Bismarck and vicinity were visited
yesterday morning with the lowest
temperature recorded for a period of
thirteen yea,r^, when'^ minimum of
forty degrees'below occurred. Since
the weathet bureau was established
here in 1874 there have been but
seven other occasions on which a
temperature of forty or more degrees
below zero was recorded. These
were as follows: Jan. 4, 1884, -40
Jan. 1, 1887, -41 Jan. 2, 1887, -44
Jan. 7, 1887, -40 Jan. 8, 1887, -42
Feb. 1, 1887, -43 Feb. 1, 1893, -41,
and Jan. 12, 1916, -40. Bismarck, how­
ever, can console herself with the
fact that the temperature in many
other places was much lower than
here, as is shown by the following
minimum temperatures recorded at
points in the United States and Cana­
da yesterday,—Battleforti, -56 Dev­
ils Lake, -42 'Edmonton, -40: Havre,
-48 Medicine Hat, -52 Prince Albert,
-58 Qu'Appelle, -4(5 Swift •Current,
-48 Williston, -40, and Winnipeg, -40.
The weather bureau, however, fore­
casts gradually rising temperature
for the next few days.
Nine o'clock last evening observa­
tions at the government observation
station report the thermometer reg­
istered at &5 degrees below zero,
against Tuesday night at 12 o'clock,
when the same lowness of tempera­
ture was reported.

Who Infest Mexico.

sentation to 'General Carranza, a note
denouncing the slaying of Americans

dits and calling upon the heads ot
the de facto government for the im­
mediate pursuit, capture and punish­
ment of the perpetrators of the deed.

ed as a dastardly act, committed in

In Mexican Affairs If Carranza
Does Not Quickly Establish
Order.
NONCOMBATANTS HAVE
VERY FEW RIGHTS
No Further Action Will Be Taken
in Bandit Cases Except Demand
Punishment of Perpetrators.
Washington, Jan. K'..—There was
no indication tonight that the United
States would take any further action
in the case of the Americans slain
by Villa bandits in Mexico, beyond
the demand for the apprehension and
punishment of the outlaws, or, at the
most, to hold General Carranza re­
sponsible for the murders, if it is
shown that his ofncials were negligent
in providing protection to the party.
Attacks On Administration.
Although the latest outbreaks stir­
red the Mexican situation to the boil­
ing point and drew attacks upon the
administration in congress, probably
unequalled since the Huerta crisis
two years ago, there were no outward
signs that President
Wilson
ing influenced to alter.his policy. A
proposal by Senator Sherman, Repub­
lican, for joint intervention by the
Pan-American nations, which led in
the recognition of General Carranza,
was referred without
action

ity is uncertain.
'Stone Wants Intervention.
The most significant development
of the congressional debate came in.
the senate when Chairman Stone, of
the foreign relations committee, him­
self a Democrat, declared that if Gen­
eral Carranza proved himself unlit to
restore order, there is only one thing
to do, and that is to go down there
and intervene.
For the present, he counseled leav­
ing the situation in the hands of Pres­
ident Wilson.
Sherman Demands Protection.
In the senate. Senator Lawrence
Sherman, republican, of Illinois, in­
troduced a resolution to express the
sense of congress that there should

als, Pablo Lopez, a Yacqui chief, and
General Rayena. led the men who as­
sassinated a group of American min­
ers on Monday near Santa Ysabei,
Mexico, and the massacre was com­
mitted close in the wake of a Car­
ranza troop train, according to infor­
mation gathered tonight.
Guard Held Train.
.T. Cuazelupe Garbena, conductor of
the train bearing the Americans, in
an affidavit given to the British con­
sul at Chihuahua, said that the train
bearing the Americans was stopped
by a derailed train in a cut. This
train is said to have been part of the
equipment bearing Carranza troops.
The conductor said that. General Gar­
bena held the train under guard
while the Americans were shot to
death.
El Paso, Jan. 1'2 —1The number of
foreigners massacred in the Box
Cannon, we^r of Santa Ysabei, Mon­
day afternoon, was placed at 19 late
today. It was authoritatively stated
that General Pablo Lopez, a Yacqui
chieftain, closely allied with General
Villa, led the attack.
Probably 20 bandits attacked the
train, while 200 others were grouped
as a reserve.
Troop Train Ahead.
Arrivals from Chihuahua said that
a troop train of 2|0 cars conveying be­
tween 500 and 1,000 Carranza troops
had preceded the mining company's
special by about fifteen minutes, tear­
ing the capital. The engine and two
cars of this train were said to have
been derailed by the bandits in order
to stop the passenger train of Ameri­
cans. What became of the Carranza
soldiers, if they were in the military
train, could not be learned here.

let wound in the forehead in addition
to other wounds. It was said that
the head of C. R. Watson was com­
pletely blown off.
Carranza Gives No Protection.
Officials of the Mexican Northwest­
ern railway said that' the Carranza
government was not attempting to
protect the Madera company's prop­
erties at Madero and Person.
Delay in transportation of the bod­
ies of the victims caused much dis­
satisfaction.
Late today the bodies have not left
the capitals, although two other pas­
senger trains had come back during
the day.
Relatives Claim Bodies of Slain.
Arrangements had been made for
the passage of the bodies on arrival,
directly across the river to this city.
As the day progressed plans for a
public funeral of all the victims were
abandoned, as many relatives from
all part's of the United States claimed
the bodies of the victims.

vivor of the massacre, reached the
border here about noon In a state of
nervous and almost mental collapse.
