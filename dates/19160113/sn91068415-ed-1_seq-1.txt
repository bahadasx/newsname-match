A MOST INTERESTING MEETING.
Veterans of High Point Camp Hold
Monthly Meeting Social Confab and
Delightful Refreshments by the Daugh
ters. Saturday afternoon the High Point
camp 'of the Confederate Veterans held
its regular monthly meeting in its own
comfortable headquarters over the Wach
ovia Bank and Trust company. A large
number of veterans were on hand, to
gether with the sponsor, Miss I. Irvin
Pay lor, and other ladies and the vet
erans' committee for High Point com
posed, of Messrs. Geo. T. Wood, J. P.
Rawley and W. L. Stamey.
Commander ( Tom Wood made the
opening talk, complimenting all those
responsible for the very comfortable)
quarters and for other services rendered
and then told in a general way the his
tory of the Confederacy, the part private
and. of ficer played and regretted the fact
that historians had failed to give prop
er credit to the cause, and hoped the
day would soon come when a true his
tory by a Southern man would be writ
ten. He spoke feelingly of his "comrade
in arms," and said he hoped it "was well"
with each and all, so they could answer
the final summons without the least fear.
Geo. T. Wood followed with a very
interesting talk as a son of a Confed
erate veteran and expressing loyalty and
devotion to the cause so near his heart.
"We trust this is only a small begin
ning of what we will be able to do for
you veterans," said Mr. Wood, and
"when the time comes' for any of you to
pass to the great beyond your commit
tee would like to act as pallbearers in
loving remembrance of the services you
rendered- your southland."
W. L. Stamey was pleased to be in the
presence of such brave men who follow
ed tne fearless Lee and Jackson and
counted it a labor of love to do any
thing that would, add to the pleasure
of the veterans, whom he has always
held in tenderest regard and expected
to come to their headquarters often and
mingle with them and in part again
live over, as it were, with them the stir
ring days of the sixties, in their graphic
accounts of the same.
Daughters oJ?. the .Confederacy were
present as followsr-pOhstft','Mifes T. Ir
vin Paylor; Mesdames A. E. Tate, J.
F. Hayden, Bascom Hoskins, H. C. Fields
and A. T. Wishart, the latter the daugh

they were good, too. Cigars were passed,

SUCH IS LIFE
Riding on the train in Western
Norti Carolina during' ' the holidays
the editor noticed several amusing
incidents that would make interest
ing reading but this particular
nature study will suffice this time.
f In the seat in front of us sat two
men, ages approximately 55 and 30.
The elder man was clean shaved
except a white stubby moustache,
broad brimmed black hat, prominent
cheek bones, red complexion, eyes
that shone like diamonds, large ears 1
that cut a figure7 Son the side of his
head he was what I sized him up
to be, a moonshiner, whose eyes had '
become trained to constant watch-
ingfor .the revenue officers. The
younger of the two had on a slouch
hat, three week's growth of beard; a
colored collar, nose like the eagle's
and eyes as sharp as rhe owl. He
was the "ole man's" son. But the
picture is not completed. They had
opened up a half gallon of saur pick
les and a box of tea cakes and" the
two ate the pickles and cakes as
fast as the average man 'would get
rid of a dozen marsh mallows. 7
Surely the stomachs were copper--lined
like the still they had operated
eso long. Gee, what would the edi
tor give for such a healthy stomach!
Across the aisle from this couple
sat a business man with his lunch
of tempting articles, dainty sand
wiches wrapped in tissue papery
fancy cakes, a bottle of wine and
apples and oranges to "top off with.
Quite a contrast to the sour pickle
lunch. -
Two seats in front of the business
man sat a mother , with a one-year-old
tugging at her breast, all three
cases satisfying their hunger in
their own way but such is
life!
To be'odd" or whether or not the
circumstances caused it we arose
and went to the dining car to satisfy
our longing for something; between
sour pickles and milk ! ! .
