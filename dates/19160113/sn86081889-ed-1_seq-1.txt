pride in their homes, and spend
their earthly lives in the prepa
ration of a home in heaven.

Will You Have Sale?
Are you going to have a sale
this spring?
If so it's time to begin to plan
for it
First thirrjr is to select your
date. See to it that nobody in
your neighborhood has a sale on
that day; that court week, which
begins on the third Monday in
March,' does not interfere; and
see your auctioneer, whether he
is open for that date. Having
done this, notify the Fulton
County News to place your sale
in its register. It will staiicn
til the day of sale and will not
cost you anything if the News
prints your bills.
Why put it in the News?
Well, it's like this: If you se
lect a date for your sale and do
not let anybody know it. there
will not be any bidders at your
sale.
The more bidders you get to
your sale, the more money you
will get for your property. It's
a very easy matter to lose from
50 to 500 dollars by not having
the sale well advertised.
That's reasonable.
Well, then. The News goes
into twice as many homes in Ful
ton County as any other news
paper. Yes; we can prove it
Then, our bills. Do you see
any others that are printed on
better paper, or any more at
tractive? Com to the News office for
your sale advertising. '

Y01NGST0WN STRIKE RIOD.
Former McConnellsbarg Boy, C. Eugene
Linn, Sajs the Demon Rum Was
Responsible for Bloodshed.
Editor Peck: The great
strike now on among the laborers
of the Republic Iron and Steel
Company and those of the Youngs
town Sheet and Tube Company
together numbering about 27,000
men, started over a demand of
some of the Tube Mill laborers
for a raise of wages from 19i
cents to 25 cents an hour, which
was refused by the employers.
The dissatisfied men walked out,
and by force, compelled many
more to quit work. Some of the
Sheet and Tube Mills men re
mained in the mills, and when
they tried to escape, they were
fired upon by the strikers and a
general riot followed in which
dozens of onlookers, policemen,
and strikers were killed, several
buildings dynamited, many Bet
on fire, and the firemen beaten
back and prevented from extin
guishing the flames. Stores were
looted, saloons broken into,' and
beer and whisky rolled into the
streets and consumed by the mob
mostly foreigners. It is said
that beer and whiskey flowed in
the streets like water. State
troops now have matters partly
under control, the strikers hav
ing been driven to the hills. I
am employed by the Republic
Iron and Steel Company in the
offices as Voucher Auditing Clerk
and am in position to get in touch
with all phases of the strike and
I can say that but for the fren
zied mobs, made so by the demon
rum, such f earful ' consequences
would not have been known. I
firmly believe that this lesson
will make Youngstown dry in
1916.

It's Poeumococcos.
That's what's the matter with
youl It's not the purpose of the
News to Rcare anybody to death
but there is not any harm likely
to result from your knowing the
worst. That troublesome disease
that doctors are puzzled to know
how to treat and printers, to
know how to spell called grip,
grippe, lagrippe, La Grippe i3
now a thing of the past It has
just been discovered that the
"grip business" is all a mistake,
and that the disease is really
pneumococcus. Now, you'd bet
ter be good !
The pneumococcus," says Dr.
Emerson, Commissioner of Health
in New York, is found in the
throats of healthy men and wo
men. When the vitality is so
lowered that the body ha3 not
sufficient power of resistance dis
ease appears, mat pneumonia
does not appear, is only due to
the power of resistance.
"With the beginning of winter
comes a social whirl. In the hol
iday season people are more fre
quently in tightly packed thea
ters and stuffy restaurants, mov
ing picture shows and other plac
es. They get less rest and sleep.
Consequently there is a certain
breaking down of resistance and
conditions favorable to passing
germs from one person to anoth
er. The epidemic is the result."
Whatever it may be called, the
fact remains that when you be
gin to sneeze, your nose begins
to run, your head gets stuffy and
your bones ache, it is time for
you take care of yourself. Don't
forget that the disease is "catch
in" and do not take pains to go
about any one who has it. It
does not follow that you cannot
be near any one who ha3 the dis
ease without taking it yourself.
Smallpox, diphtheria, scarlet fe
ver are highly contagious, and
yet not every one who is exposed
to contact with a patient having
one or another of these diseases
takes it . If your physical condi
tion is perfect you have nothing
to fear; if your system is run
down, you have. That's all there
is to it
Use you handkerchief when
you sneeze or cough, and thus
avoid spreading the infection to
those about you, ,

EFFICENCY OF GRANGE WORK.
Clear Cot Expressions from the Pen of
Irvie Dull Dohmaa of Gosh
en, Washington.
Dear Mr. Peck: Herewith
you will find a money order for
one dollar to cover my subscrip
tion to the News to December 1,
1916. Can't get along without
the news from dear "Little Ful
ton."
My husband and I read with
much interest the editorial which
appeared in your paper of De
cember 30th, entitled, "Business
Men vs. Farmers," written by J
D. Ream, Master of the State
Grange of Nebraska. Our
Grange, Van Wyck, No. 217, or
ganized in 1908, is greatly inter
ested in the Rural Credits and
Natioual Marketing issues. Aft
er a careful study of the various
plans of Rural Credits, we de
cided in favor of the Louck's
plan, considering it most practi
cable and best suited to our con
ditions. C. B. Kegley, Master
of our State Grange, is the Pres
ident of the Rural Credit League
of America.
Every rural mail box in our
country is a monument to the
efficiency of Grange work; for it
was theconstant pressure brought
to bear upon Congress by the
National Grange and the thous
ands of its members, that brought
this just piece of legislation to
the farmer. To the Grange are
we also indebted for our Parcels
Post law; and we are confident
of a right settlement of the
Rural Credits and National Mar
keting questions, which means
financial freedom ' and square
dealing in selling.
Broke Collar Bone..
Last Sunday, Mrs. Emily Eys-
ter, who lives with her son Frank
Smith, near Webster,. MiKs, ' fell
down a stairway and broke one
of her collar bones.; Dr. .Mosser
reduced the fracture, t The fall
was quite a shock to .the, aged
lady, but she stood (he operation
of having the bones put to their
place very-j'-1- ' "ST Mo be
The Half Was Not Told.
In the issue of the News
December lbth, 1 notice y
scribe lost sight of some of J.
Mort's close calls. Here are
few more or them: A lew years
ago while cutting ice on the Mad
densvijie dam, he broke through
and fell into about nine feet of
water when he unwittingly step
ped on thin ice frozen over a hole
made the day before. His com
panions, Eli Ferrenburg and Rob
ert Ramsey, were at the bank at
the time. Ferrenberg saw Mort
go down and began to yell. Ram
sey reached the drowning man
first and found him holding to
the edge of the ice and swinging
under the 16-inch covering of the
dam. Siezing Mort by the arm
Ramsey held him until Ferren
berg arrived and, together they
pulled the unfortunate man out
in an exhausted condition. When
asked if he touched bottom Mort
replied "I wasn't hunting bot
torn; I was hunting the hole
fell through."
At another time, Mr. Mort was
going home from Hustontown at
night The colt he was driving
frightened at some calves in
Henry Wilson's field, wheeled
short in the road, and took to
the woods despite all he could do
to hold it. As the horse turned
into the road again the buggy
was upset and the driver pinned
under and dragged some dis
tance. Fortunately the harness
gave way and the animal was re
leased from the buggy and start
ed alone to its home. Mr. Wil
son saw the running colt and
took the back track in search of
the driver. He found him lying
at the side of the road badly
bruised and sprained, but no
bones broken.
During a recent winter when
the earth was covered with a sol
id sheet of ice, and water had to
be carried by hand to some cal
ves, Mr. Mort got tired of the
job and dusted a path over the
ice to the water. Soon after
turning the calves out he heard
a racket at the barn and with
the aid of a stout stick from the
woodpile, he started to investi
gate. Very soon his feet and the
ice parted company and Mr.
Mort proceeded at greatly in
creased speed head foremost
down hill until a stone reversed
him, and his feet led the way at
a speed that beat Jersey light
ning. 50 rods down the hill a
patch of .green briers stopped the
mad flight. Nothing worse of
the wear, he had almost reached
the top of the hill again when-
well, this time when he involun
tarily reached the foot of the hill
on the second trip, at another
place not so soft as the green
brier patch, he was injured so
badly that Mr. Wilson was called
by phone and he and the Mr.
Mort's wife and daughter helped
the unfortunate man to the house
where he nursed many bruises
and cuts for several days. Now,
if any other man has gone all
through the flintmill ten times
and still feels like a 16-year-old.
;et us hear from him.

A Suggestion.
F. M. Taylor, and his son John
of Harrisburg, spent the holidays
at home, and both returned to
Harrisburg early this week. John
is employed at the Pipe and Pipe
Bending Works assisting to make
shells for the Allies. His father
is employed in the State Engin
eering Department Mr. Taylor
is arranging to erect a rest house
and refreshment stand on his
and at the west foot of Cove
mountain for the accommodation
cf summer motorists. If Frank
will pardon our "butt in," we
would respectfully suggest that
he carry out a former idea for

Farmers Institute.
As announced last week, Farm
ers Institutes will be held Janu
ary 18th and 19th at Rehoboth
M. E. church, and in the Clear
Ridge M. E. church January 20th
and 21st In addition to what,
wa3 said in the News last week
Chairman Frank Ranck states
that the subject of County Agent
would be considered at some of
the sessions. We are glad of it
The News has been spokesman
on thi3 subject for some of the
progressive farmers of Fulton
county for more than a year. We
did the best we could. Still.
hundreds do not seem to under
stand the movement We fully"
pelieve that abundant fruits of
our institutes will not appear un
til the Farm Extension : Depart
ment is permitted to keep an
Agent permanently in the Coun
ty. It will then be more like one
continuous institute. We hope
that when we secure an Agent,
he will be a lover of good homes,,
and that he will have been train
ed to understand that merely liv-
ing for the sake of making mon
ey is a low ideal, and that he
will immediately set about to
guide the young people to realizo
that there are ways of making
as nice homes and as good living
here as they think they see at
the far end of the rainbow.
