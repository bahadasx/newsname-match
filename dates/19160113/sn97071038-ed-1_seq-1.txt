Proposition of llondlng County for
Good Hoads Will Also be Tak
en Up and Dismissed.
Officers for the year 1916 will be
elected at the regular meeting of the
Heppner Commercial Club tomorrow
(Friday) night. President Notson is
urging a full attendance of members
at this time. Vital issues concerning
the development of Heppner and Mor
row county will have to be met and
settled during the coming yeRr and
unless Heppner has an energetic, live
wire organization to thresh out all
matters for the ultimate good of the
community, it is advanced by our
progressive, constructive citizens
that commercial advancement will be
slow in coming this way.
The proposition of bonding Morrow
county for the purpose of construct
ing permanent high ways will be
brought up and thoroughly discussed
at this meeting. Many of Oregon's
greatest road builders, including
those responsible for the Columbia
highway, favor the bonding method
as the best method for raising funds
in the building of permanent roads.
In Umatilla county active Bteps are
being taken toward putting the bond
ing issue before the voters at an early
date. Gilliam county is also working
hard on the road bonds issue. The
counties of Multnomah, Hood River
and Wasco, along the route of the
great highway, have already voted
bonds as the quickest and surest
method for obtaining lasting high
ways and at the same time giving fu
ture generations a chance to con
tribute to a permanent proposition.
Winer Now In Limbo.
Frank Winer, a hide and pelt buy
er well known in Heppner and vicin
ity, is now In the state penitentiary at
Salem according to Sheriff MeDuuee.
Winer was sent up from Albany about
two months ago, it is said, for the
larceny of some hides and pelts in
Linn county. While in Heppner, Wi
ner spent one third of his time In jail
and the other two thirds in getting in
and out again.

Large numbers of lone citizens
were among those participating In the
big rabbit drive at Ewings last Sun

take many more such drives to get

very numerous and are coming In off
the hills to the creek in large num
bers. Some are Inclined to think that
a heavy snow, with cold weather fol
lowing, will prove an eradlcator of
the rabbit pest, and we hope that this
might be so.

About one foot of snow here on the
level. To date, Tuesday evening reg
istered the coldest of the season b
far, the mercury going down to 6 be
low zero. However, there was a
change for warmer conditions by nine
o'clock and another fall of snow wai
registered. While this condition is
rather hard on stock. owinE to a lacn
of feed, the farmers realize that it is
the best thing for the county and arp
anxious to have sufficient snow fall
now to guarantee a good crop next
fall. It surely looks like is was com
ing. S. L. Beck is sinking a well on the
Barzee place, some 13 miles north of

not able to make much progress, ow

other of the ranches about here are
being supplied with good wells and
not many years hence the water wag
on will be relegated to the junk heap,
and used only as an adjunct to the
threshing outfit in the summer time.
This is a condition that augurs well
for this end of the county, and makes
for permanency and contentment on
the part of the settlers. Small won

come discouraged, when visited by
short crops and adverse conditions,

Better days are nigh, and their com
