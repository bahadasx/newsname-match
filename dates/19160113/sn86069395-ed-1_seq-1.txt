NOTHING OF
IMPORTANCE
Yas Done When The New Com
missioners Met Last
Tuesday.
BIG CROWD DISAPPOINTED
'rincipal Business Was Giving
Second Passage to Several
Ordinances.
The City Commissioners met in
regular session at 10:15 o'clock Tues
day morning, with a big crowd on
hand to see if anything "dropped" in
police matters.
Mavor Yost did not occupy the
stand, but took his scat at the tabic.
The Mayor and Commissioner Wicks
were on one side of the table and
Commissioner Bassett and Solicitor
Breathitt on the other, while Clerk
Lawson Flack occupied a place at the
foot of the table with his back to the
audience.
The principal business was to ap
prove the minutes of the former meet
ing. The minutes wore prepared m
great detail to be approved before be
ing recorded.
Several lengthy ordinances were
read and later reread for second pass
ageland this took nearly an hour.
Clerk Lawson Flack has a clear,
resonant and well trained voice and
his excellent reading was commented
upon by all. It is doubtful if the city
has ever had a more capable clerk
than he bids fair to make. At the re
quest of Commissioner Bassett he
turned about and faced the audience
while reading the ordinances.
Ordinance No. 1 prescribing the
duties of the Commissioners was giv
en its final passage,
Ordinance No. 2 fixing salaries and
creating places to be filled was given
its second passage, but under the law
must lie over one week, since it con
tains an indirect appropriation.
A resolution fixing the regular time
for meeting at 10 o'clock every Tues
day was again passed.
The minutes of a special meeting
held Jan. 5 to fix the amount of bonds
to be given by employes, were next
read and approved. The chief of po
lice will give $2,500, the other police
officers, workhouse keeper and cem
etery sexton will give $1,000, all to be
paid for by the city.
Various accounts made by the prev
ious administration were reported by
Finance Commissioner Wicks as Imv
ing beon paid, the amounts aggregat
ing $1,554.01.
The Latham Poor Fund's income
was ordered turned over to the Asso
ciated Charities.
BIG C0P0RATI0N
IS FORMED
Authorized Capital Stock One
Hundred and Fifty Thous
and Dollars.
Articles of incorporation of The J,
II, Andorson Company were file'dl
with the County Clerk yesterday
morning. The authorized capital

Bell and George W. Croiiilww. The
buginoee will be conducted as a cor
poration, beginning not later tlwm
Feb. 1, and will continue for twonty
five years.
SOME SENATE BILLS.

troduced Tuesday wore a stato-wido
prohibition bill, anti-pass bill, anti
lobby bill, to establish negro normal
school in Wostorn Kentucky, to make
