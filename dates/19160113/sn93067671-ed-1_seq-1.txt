Pumpkintown News
Not long ago "Bud" Holder,
having killed a billv-goat,started
to skin it. After he had the
hide split down the legs and
belly, the goat jumped up and
ran off, leaving the old man
horror-stricken with his knife in
his hand. Mr. Holder said:
"When I caught the old fool
again I chopped his head off be
fore attempting to finish my job
of removing his coat."
It is reported from Pleasant
Grove . section that during the
Christmas holidays several win
dows in the schoolhouse were
broken, a blackboard cut to
pieces, a water pitcher ahd a
lamp belonging to the church
destroyed, and to climax the
whole thing, a cat, which evi
dently had been shot several
times, was hung up in a tree in
the schoolhouse vard. And be
sides all this, a buggy top was
cut to pieces in a shed at 1). L.
Barker's one night. Who con
mitted these depredations re
main a mystery. What is the
world coming to?
Vernon Corbin, the squirrel
killer, moved away from Pump
kintown last week. , He's gone
to the mountains where there
are ilenty of squirrels.
The Hogwallow cbrrespondent
says: "Miss Fiutie Belcher was
thrown from her mule with a
basket of eggs and Ellick Hell
wanger." But how could El
lick get into a basket of eggs?
He must have had a somiwhat
egg-citing time doing that. When
Miss Fiutie fell off her mule the
basket probably rolled into a
gully and turned bottom upward,
egg-sploding the eggs and im
prisoning Elleck. However, we
hope Miss Flutie quickly eggs
t r i c a t e d that eggs-asperated
youth from under that basket of
eggs and egg-splained what had
happened. Pardon us, Dunk;
we knew what you meanit. But
it was funny to look at it that
way, and we ltnewv you wvould
not "get on your ear" about it;
you lik~e a joke too well for that.
Go it, Dunk: you're creating
many a smile, and a man who
can create a smile in this sour
old world is helping to make life
a little brighter for someone.
Not a single pumpkin can be
seen inPumpkintown nowadays.
We mean the kind that grows
on a vine, 'of course.

M.W. Hester on Woman Suffrage
Editor of The Pickens Senti
nel: If you will give me space
in your valuable columns I will
have a say 0on Woman Suffrage.
It is coming no matter what
any man or set of men may do
or say. When the old heredi
tary slave spirit grows out of
women they will enact and ex
ecute the laws. She is major
in number,. unsurpassed in in
tellect,superior mn morality, and
what she lacks In physical abil
ity she overbalances in influ
ence. Then why should she be
governed by men? Note, if you
please, where women have come
from in ihe last nineteen hun
dred years and you wvIll see at a
glance where she will go in a
few more dlecades. She is slow
ly but surely emancipating her
self ahd will soon be on a par
with men, and then superior.
Some of the youngest readers of
this will live to see all this come
true; Votes for women was
started by an infidel, where all
freedom has come from. Tom
Paine was the first to advocate
freedom for America; free press
and free speech were started lby
infidels, negro slavery was abol
ished by the plans laid by infi
dels, Bob Ingersoll being one
of the greatest exponents. The
theory that "Man shall rule his
house",and that "Woman shall
be subject to her husband"' are
fast nassing behind the onward
march of intelligence and women
shall be free and she will be
woman no longer and shall as
sume another name for her sex.
Repudiate any of this if you
please and we will' bring the
proof for every assertion.
Respedtfully,
Easlov. M. W. H1w1E3'Im
IfWhy It Pays to Read, OeM
A LL advertised utoods are more

Good Farmink
It is grativing to us to tell of
the successful farming of a
young farmer, Mr. T. M. Jame
son. who owns and resides on
the James Lathem place near
the old Arnold mill, four or five
miles northeast of 'Easley. Mr.
Jameson made the past year
on a two and one-half horse crop
twenty-seven bales of cotton,
which sold for more than $1,600,
besides $240.00 worth of cotton
seed, cribbed over 300 bushels of
corn, and made 240 bushels of
peavine hav, besides plenty of
vegetables of all kinds'to do his
familv. When it is known that
Mr Janieson is a cripple, hav
Ing only one hand, his success
seems moro remarkable. It
shows what enere-y and perse
verance will accomplish even
under adverse circumstances.
