(From Sunset Magazine)
Left to the men, Arizona would
still be "wet." It was not until
the women were given an equal
place with the men at the election
polls that the change came on Jan
uary 1, 1915.
Prohibition has worked a radical
change, to which business, munici
pal government and politics have
not yet adjusted their affairs com
pletely. Even the peace officers
over the state do not quite know
what to make of it. The rust has
accumulated on the locks of many
outlying jails so that they can't be
opened with a key. There has
been no occasion to open, many of
them. Even the city bf 'Prescott
did not have an arrest for three
months last summer.
Bobbie Burns, the dauntless offi
cer of Williams, spent most of his
official time in former years wrestl
iiag in the guttters with recalcitrant
drunks and thugs; now he rides
about in an automobile and wears
a boiled shirt. One Sunday morn
ing a few months after prohibition
closed the saloons he was standing
idly in front of the empty police
station gazing at the millenncium
which he saw gathering over Bill
Williams' Peak and enveloping
what was formely known far and
wide s the toughest town on the
Santa Fe. He watched the Mexi
cans and Greeks going to church
with their wives, and he thought of
other Sunday mornings when he
had led these same men off to jail
to recover from Saturday night
sprees.
"I can't tell a sheepherder now
from a traveling man for a candy
house," Bobbie declared. "They
are wearing wrist watches and the
cowpunchers shed their horses be
fore they get to town and jerk their
pants down over their boots. Can
you beat it?"
Marshal Bobbie Burns' vision of
the millennium widened as he talk
ed. He declared ' that if it were
not for the hoboes who drop off the
trains at Williams he would get
soft in the arms.
It is true that laborers have bank
accounts who never knew what
saving meant. The saving accounts
of the States bank increased nearly
a half million dollars in eight
months. The total deposit in all
State and National banks in Ari
zona increased $3,000,000 during
the same period of prohibition.
At one of the logging camps of
Northern Arizona recently the sup
erintendent from headquarters was
handed a bundle of checks many of
them three and four ruoaths old,
and requested to deposit them in
the bank to the credit of the differ
ent owners. Theye men had never
saved when the saloons were run
ning. This is the beginning of the
vice of thrift.
I have examined the records of
the sheriffs' offices and city police

WILLIAM MCCOY DEAD
The " serious illness of William
McCoy, reported in last week's
News, resulted fp on Fri
day. Funer-;t1 .vices were
held at vcatholic church,
Mo t'orning and interment
w .iiade in the Williams ceme
tery. The death of Mr. McCoy came
as a shock to most people as his
illness was of short duration.
For one week previous to last
Thursday, he did not feel well
and was unable to work. Wed
nesday night, January 5th, his
illness suddenly developed into
double pneumonia. On Thurs
day he was hurried to Needles,
attended by Mrs. Reinhardt,
Santa Fe nurse. Death resulted
at 10 o'clock in the afternoon of.
the following day, Friday, Jan
uary 7th.
Mr. William McCoy was born
at Grand Haven, Michigan,
Nov. 12, 1873. He came to Ari
zona from LeRoy, Michigan, in
1901. He at first located at
Flagstaff where he accepted a
position under Mr. Dennis. He
later located at Williams where
he has resided since. He was
married to Mrs, McCoy, April
29, 1908. He died at the age of
forty-one, leaving four brothers,
John, Cfearles, James and Frank,
of Michigan, and a wife and two
little children, Margaret aged
one and a half and Billy, aged
five, to mourn his loss.
The funeral service was a
beautiful one and the casket was
literally hidden by a robe of
flowers from loving friends and
relatives. , .
The sympathy of the entire
neighborhood is extended to the
grieving wife and the sweet little
children so suddenly deprived of
a loving husband and father.

RED LAKEVALLEY
The snow here has reached an
average depth of about thirty
inches. While the farmers are
partially snow bound at present,
they feel that good crops are in
sight for the coming season.
Mrs. Buchanan and family
who have been visiting at W. F.

ing as they all use skis in making
the trip.
L. W. Cureton who has been
living on his ranch for several
days has decided to move nearer
town until the snow clears away.
The manager of the Box K
cattle outfit from near Anita
passed through this section re
cently. He reports an eighteen
inch snow in his section and is
confident that all the watering
tanks will be full when the snow
goes off; But to make sure of it
he is dragging his ditches to in
crease the water flow. He claims
by this method that he has saved
considerable water from the first
snow which was very light com
pared with this one. He is a live
wire in the stock business and
does not care to take any chances
where a little labor will make
things sure. . He informs us that
he spent the holidays in Flagstaff
and reports an excllent time.
. A few trappers are in the val
ley at present trying to catch
some of the large number of coy
otes wintering here.
Since the recent snow several
of the farmers are making plans
for a larger crop.

rain and partly snow fell. The

ed to participate in the bounte
ous gift.- The snow fell to a
depth of somewhat over a foot
in Sedona and vicinity. This is
a very rare occurrence and while
under ordinary conditions range
for cattle is good it is safe to say
the coming season will be an ex
ceptionally good one. . Cattle
men and : ranchers have every
reason to rejoice.

about four miles south of here

pelled to camp for the night. It
turned cold and began to snow.
Mr. Smith found his matches all
wet. It was move or chill so he
moved and moved all night long.
His son went, to his aid with
another team.
In Memory of Mrs. Caufman
(Contributed)
Mrs. Francis E. Shaw Caufman,
loving wife of Jacob Caufman, and
devoted mother of Mrs. C. M. Wolfe
and R. A. Caufman, bade her loved
ones, Life's Last Farewell, on Tues
day morning, and lo, just as the
first rays of the morning sunlight
were casting their beams upon the
azure blue. 'Twas 5:15 in the
morning, while all else was still,
that the angel of death came knock
ing at the door of thj sanctuary
that had held her life within, these
three score years and ten and sum
moned her to the Great Court of
her Creator, and the smile that first
lit her countenance on the morning
of the first day of Ft-bruary, 1846,
wreathed again the face now fur
rowed with age and as those who
sat around the bedside and saw the
smile enthroned upon her features
and stood breathless with joy be
lieving that she was growing better
and recovering from her long illness
looked with amazement upon its
vanishing flight, and that smile
that had blossomed these many
years, melted and dissolved itself
into another day in that land, That
Bourne from which no man returns.
Mrs. Caufman was born at the
town of Center, Rock County, Wis
consin, February 1st., 1846, and
was married to Jacob Caufman on
July 22nd, 1865, and for many
years resided in Ness County, Kan
sas. fromrwhich they removed to
Williams, Arizona, more than twenty-five
years ago. Mrs. Caufman
was well known thruought the
state and her many friends will
learn with keen regret the said be
reavement of her husband and fam
ily.' As a wife, Mrs. Caufman bore
the sufferings of womanhood with
patience . and fortitude and these
she. moulded , into a weave of the
best family fabric that has with
stood all the vicissitudes of fifty
years of married life and left to
this section of Arizona, a monument,
in her boy and girl, that will out
last 'the whitest of marble, the
glossiest of onyx and the hardest of
granite. As proud as she was of
her family equally proud and solic
itous was she of her friends, and
her courtesy was not measured by
wealth or pomp. She was, as God
wants vuf all to be, one of His own,
and in her love of Him her love was
unbound and unfettered and she
loved not one, but all. Her demise
is indeed a loss to her family, but
greater than this is her loss to the
community, where her presence
has always been felt and noticed
like unto the fragrance of the rose,
and we bow in bumble submission
tothe will of the Almighty, andpr ay t
May Gods greatest gift to mankind
be, not riches nor gold, but another
mother, another sister, another
wife, just like Mother Caufman.
EcL. The funeral services were
held at the Caufman home Wed
nesday afternoon at three o'clock.
Rev. Boone conducted the services.
The Ladies of the Maccabees at
tended in a body and accompanied

Robert Shaw, and a sister, Mrs. J.
M. Tracey, at Pawnee City Nebras

sister, Mrs. Hatiie Gilbert in Colo

Jacob Caufman; a son, R. A. Cauf
man; a daughter, Mrs. Cab Wolfe,

Williams, to mourn her loss. Her
grandsons, the Wolfe boys, were
