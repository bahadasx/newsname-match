A Good Letter.
Someone has. advanced the op
inion that the letter "e" is the
most unfortunate letter in the
English alphabet, because it is
always out of cash, forever in
debt, never out of danger and in
hell. all the, time. For some rea-
son, ne overlooked tne iorcunates
of the letter, as we call his atten
tion to the fact "e" is never in
war and always in peace It is
the beginning of existence, the
commencement of ease and the
end of trouble. Without it there
would be no meat,, no life and no
heaven. It is the center of hon
esty, makes love perfect and

jpat whose, pa poe .was .Kitty. She had

which sue uvea was fiig, Deauurui
building. Opposite her . lived a poor
dog '.named Toby, who. .being unused
to the luxuries of Kitty, did not know
wbat it was to be. proud. vAt this time
there was a certain Jaw between dogs
and cats. This law was that when you
are pleased you must wag your tail, but
when you are .angry you must keep it
stiff. Kitty, thinking that as she was so
rich it was unfair to make her do even
one thing x the same as . such poor
creature as Toby, broke this law and
did Just the opposite. ..She was, of
course, punished, and since then cats
wag their tails when they are angry
instead of vhea they are pleased.

Gettysburg.
Our revival meeting has been
in progress for a week with
good attendance and interest.
Last night Rev. L. E. Carr de
lrvered a very appropriate ser
mon for the occasion in our M. E.
pulpit. The audience was very
large and it is hoped, after being
heard by so many, that some
good results will follow.
On last Friday the Franklin
township high school and our
school gave a contest in our school
auditorium in the way of some
sort of a program and a debate.
the question of which was "Pre
paredness. ' ' The Franklin town
ship school had the negative side
of the q-estion and won out by a
small majority on points, but
while that school won out on that
question our school won out upon
the whole with a very small mar-
gi n. Th is goes to show that both
schools were pretty equally
matched. Ye Scribe was not
present to hear the exercises-.
but it is said the smallest mem
ber on the negative side, and for
that matter, the smallest by odds
taking part, delivered a most
creditable argument. Th's only
shows what small fellows can do
when they have a mind to. Our
boys will have to come into the
ring with a larger preparedness
for responsibility assumed. This
will only act as "a spur to our
boys to rise to better effort. It
is said that all acquitted them-
selyes in a creditable manner,
except some very small boys,
(large enough to know and do
better) who annoyed the audi
ence by thro arin; beans. Come
now, boys, you should do better,
and on all public occasions deport
yourselves in a proper way, but
if you caitnot do better, then we
suggest th-at you go in the com
pany of your mothers and be
sealed with them, who will see

flourished today, as in days past,
such conduct would not be wit
nessed in public. I suppose those
boys are too small to know they
are casting reflections upon their
parents and teachers. If they
are not and that further out
breaks of the kind will not occur,
I am not sure that , the passage
from the woodshed and birch to
the Juvenile court has been a
wise movement. If the former
yet prevailed the parent would
correct the trouble, , but under
the latter the public administers
the castigation. Boys ought to
have brain enough to control and
direct their own conduct and if
they did, much annoyance would
be paved to the public and . much
chagrin to the parent concerned.
I hope there will be no . further
occasion to allude to like occur
rences.
