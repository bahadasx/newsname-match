General Ian Hamilton's report on the
British operations on the Gallipoli Pen
insula was published in the London
Official Gazette. It tells the story of
the fighting on the peninsula from the
beginning of May to the middle of Oc
tober. The Suvla Bay landing failed to
accomplish its object, the report
shows, partly because the force con
sisted largely of untried troops under
generals inexperienced in the new war
fare, and partly through the failure of
the water supply. The sufferings of
the troops for lack of water made
painful reading.

Representative McArthur has intro
duced a bill proposing a reduction in
the rate of postage on local delivery
letters from 2 cents to 1 cent an ounce.
Under this bill any letter would be de
livered anywhere in the city where
mailed, or on any rural route leading
therefrom, for 1 cent, and in the same
field patrons of rural routes would send
letters for the 1-cent rate. Mr. Mc
Arthur said that he had found that it
costs the government on an average a
quarter of a cent to deliver a local
letter.
Washington, D. C Secretary Gar
rison told the house military commit
tee at a hearing Monday that compul
sory service was the only really ade
quate basis on which to construct a
military policy compatible with the
idea of democratic government.
The secretary made the assertion
merely as an expression of personal
sentiment, he said, and did not elabo
rate on it. Hia statement was regard
ed as significant, however.
Representative Shallenberger asked
Secretary Garrison if universal mili
tary obligation did not make it possi
ble for nations to be drawn into war
despite the wishes of the majority of
the people.
"I do not think France or Germany
would be waging war if the majority
of their peoples did not favor it," re
plied the secretary. "No nation ever
is at war at variance with the wishes
of the great majority of its people."
Suffragists Win Point.
Washington, D. CThe Susan B.
Anthony amendment providing for
woman suffrage was reported favor
ably to the senate by the suffrage com
mittee. "In our opinion, every princi

suffrage rests demands the extension of
its privileges and responsibilities to

support of government, and subject
to a common political destiny."

the support of Secretary of the Inter

Party lines were cast aside in voting
on the measure. Minority Leader
Mann was one of its strongest suppor
ters. His Republican colleague, Re
presentative Mondell of Wyoming, and
other Western Republicans fought it,
insisting that Federal control would
delay development of the sites.
Western Senators are planning a
hard fight on the measure in the up

Control of the power plants under
the bill would rest jointly with the
state and Federal governments, except
by court order, leases could not be
transferred without the consent of the
Secretary of the Interior. States hav
ing public utility boards could exer
cise their full powers in regulating
rates for power and the issuance of
bonds. In states without such boards
the Secretary of the Interior would ex
ercise this power.

Fort Yellowstone, Wyoming, who, with
four companions, was out sledding Sun
day at the Mammoth Hot Springs, near
Fort Yellowstone, was killed by a
snowslide. All five were caught in
the slide. McDonald's companions
were able to free themselves, but the
lieutenant remained buried for 46 min

lease him. He waa then unconscious.
Supreme court further has uniformly
upheld this principle as being a legiti
mate exercise of the police power of
the state.
It asserts the contention that the
law interferes with religious liberty to
be ill-founded, and declares it essen

It sweeps aside techincal points
raised against the validity of the law
such as the alleged insufficiency of the
title of the amended law of 1865 and
other irregularities..

We have no fault to And with the
many excellently prepared and co-
called cooked cereals which from time
to time are found appetising and
agreeable in appearance, but there is
also need of cereals which require
long-continued cooking to extract the
full value of the grain and bring it to
a delicious creaminess. In this class
are oatmeal, wheat, hominy, rice and
corn. By whatever nt.me the various
ground preparations are called, they
all need continued, intense cooking to
burst the starch cells, soften the sur
rounding busk tissues, and sutke them
thoroughly fit for human food.
Cracked wheat is a coarse form of

MILK MACHINES SAVE TIME
Do Not Affect Milk Flow, According
to Tests Made at Geneva (N. Y.)
Experiment Station.
The first United States patent cov
ering a milking machine was Issued In
1849. In 1860 two more were granted.
Since that time various devices
have been patented.
Tests made by the New York agri
cultural experiment station at Geneva
prove that machine milking does not
affect the milk flow.
It was also found that milking ma
chines were great time savers. Tbe
total time required to milk 30 cows
was 121.02 minutes, or an average of
4.034 minutes to milk one cow.
Under commercial conditions, the
time could be decidedly lessened.
The milking machine is no longer an
experiment It is being used the world
over by progressive dairymen.
