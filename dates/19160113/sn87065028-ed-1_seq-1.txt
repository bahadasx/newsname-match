thy diligence and discretion in the
performance of their respective
tasks, and the second district now
has a system of public highways
which is not only a credit to the men
who were directly responsible for
their construction, but to the peo

Another recent development in
public road matters came Monday
afternoon, when a joint meeting of
the road commissioners of districts
two and five was held at the Cham

which provides that the second dis

The proposition has already been
accepted by the people o'f the first
district, but there are several road
organizations in district five, and e
committee consisting of Messrs. C
W. Evans, W. G. 'Evans, Carey
Cocke, W. C. Banks, R. R. Banks and
T. B. Hardy was appointed to hold
a conference with the different com

though, for the moment, the Rus
