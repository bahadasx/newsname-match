ORGANIZATION OF
COUNTY AGNTS
State College, N. M., Jan. 7.-
At a conference ,of county agents
held in connection with the New
Mexico Farmers' Congress, a
permanent organization, to be
called ' 'New Mexic'o County Ag
riculturists' Association" was ef
fected to which only county
agents shall be elligible and
which will hold its annual meet
ings during Farmers' Week at
the Agricultural College. Ro
land C. Harwell, of Torrance
county, was elected president,
and Paul B. Barber, of Dona Ana
county, secretary and treasurer.
The objects of the association
, XT , . , .
ditions in New Mexico and to
deal with problems of special in-
terest to county agents. The two
officers named together with Di
rector A. C. Cooley shall be the
executive committee. The other
members are M. R. Gonzales for

GUARANTY LOAN CO.
GIVEN GLEAN BILL
A. G. Whittier, New Mexico
state traveling auditor, has just
made public a report covering a
scrutinizing examination of
The Stockmen's Guaranty Loan
company's affairs, made Decem
ber 4-5 last, in which he gives
the company a clear bill of finan
cial stability, finding in his con
clusions that the company's plan
of operation is sound, that the
company is on a thoroughly
solvent basis and that its officers
are building a corporation which
should work for the good of the
state. Copies of this report
which have been printed in the
Albuquerque papers show it to
be one of .the strongest bills of
health ever given a new cor
poration in New Mexico. The
report is of special interest since
it shows that the company, by
assuming direct supervision of
its stock salesmen and full con
trol over its fiscal agent, has cor
rected the only source of adverse
criticism against its operations
thus far. W. C. Oesterich. the
president, and others interested
in the organization work stand
high in the Albuquerque finan
cial community and the company
will begin its active career under
very favorable conditions for ser
vice to the live stock interests
and to the development of the
state.

BIDS REJECTED
As will be seen by reference to
our Mountainair correspondence,
the government has rejected all
the bids submitted for carrying
the mail on the proposed Moun-tainair-Estancia
route, for the
reason that all bids were "too
high," the lowest bid being
$3,000 per year. We have heard
it intimated on different oc
casions that the "government"
sometimes has a head that is
solid bone, and there are not
wanting indications that this
view is correct. A man of or
dinary perceptions knows that
under the schedule in the prop
osition $3,000 is little enough. It
might be possible to make the
trip with horses by changing
three or four times enroute, but
it is not practicable and so it is
correct to say that it is impos-'
sible to use horses. Hence it re
solves itself into an automobile
proposition. A year's work is
313 trips of 86 miles with fifty to
seventy-five stops, in all kinds of
weather over all kinds of roads
No practical automobile man
needs to be told what this means.
The passenger traffic could not
be counted upon to swell the in
come greatly. It 9 true that the
Estancia-Eastview route is con
tracted at a little fess than 81,500.
It's worth repeating, and worth thinking about
every day our strong hold is
Quality and Price
It is our constant endeavor to keep our stock up ' '
to the highest possible standard in quality, and J'.
prices at the lowest possible figure.

and it is but ten or fifteen miles
shorter. But this is too low, as
the contractor undoubtedly will
admit, and besidps, the schedule
makes a big difference. The
Mountainair-Estancia schedule
requires the carrier to leave
Mountainair in the morning and
return in the evening, with a re
quired - speed of nine miles an
hour with stops, whereas the
Estancia-Eastview schedule re
quires the carrier to leave Es
tancia in the morning and return
in the evening, and leave East
view in the morning and return
in the evening, thus permitting
two carriers to meet at Torreón
and return to each end of the
route, and requiring speed of not
above four and one-half miles an
hour. If the schedule between
Mauntainair and Estancia could
be arranged on the same basis it
would make a material difference
in the cost of maintaining the
service.
