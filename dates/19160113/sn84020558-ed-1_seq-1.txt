Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12. Congress
was swept by a wave of indignation
today over the killing of American
citizens by Mexican bandits near Chi
huahua City. Demands for action
came front minority members, and,
while tlie administration's: leaders
counselled peace, even Senator Stone,
chairman of the senate foreign rela
tions committee, admitted that if Car
ranza, after a fair trial, failed to pro
tect foreigners in Mexico, then inter
vention was inevitable.
The atmosphere was surcharged
wiih excitement when the senate and
the house met, and the storm broke
quickly. Senator Sherman, republican,
of Illinois, introduced a resolution to
express fhe sense jf congress that
there should be intervention by the
diked Stales and Pan-American na
tions unless General Carranza could
comply at once with o demand that
he protect the lives and property of
foreigners. In the house, Representa
tive Dyer of Missouri offered a reso
lution asking President Wilson whether j
lie did not think the time had arrived
to abandon "watchful waiting" and
invade Mexico.
The resolutions were not acted upon,

a general spirit of resentment thai J
most eonesrvative leaders found it dif- j
ficult to restrain Senators Galiinger
and Borah, on .the republican side of j
the chamber, echoed the terms of the (
Sherman resolution which declared .
that the Carranza government ap- j
peared powerless to cope with th2
lawlessness in Mexico, and declared
intervention the only alternative un
less reparation for the Chihuahua out-
rages were speedily made and the de ,
facto government in future showed it
self capable of controlling tne situa
tion. Senator Stone urged patriotic sup
poi t of th president and patient for
bearance until the experiment of try
ing out the Carranza government
shoifld prove a failure.
"If Carranza proves himself ineffi
cient, however," he said, "if he is un
able ti punish criminals and to insure
safety to foreigners in Mexico, I think
with the senator from Idaho, Mr.
ISorah, that there is only one thing i
to do and that is to go down there
armed and intervene."
Senator Thomas of Colorado also
advised against intervention except as
an unavoidable resort, declining that
the United States never would get out
of .Mexico '. Its tirmies once crossed
the Rio Grande. He made a vigorous
speech, assailing the Standard Oil
company and the Pearson Oil syn
dicate, charging that these interests
through rival efforts to monopolize
the oil properties, ii Mexico had been
responsible for the revolutions of that
country and for strife along the bor
der. Senator Sherman's resolution
prompted Senator Galiinger to read
a telegram from Judge L. W. Holmes
of New Hampshire, asking that every
possible thing be done to locate his
son, Thomas Holmes, only surviving
member of the group of Americans
attacked by the Mexican bandits near
J'hihiahua. Later, announcing that
Holmes had been located, the New
Hampshire senator remarked that the
time certainly had come for conclu
sive action in Mexico.
Senator Stone expressed the belief
that the bandits committed the mur
ders deliberately to embarrass the
Carranza government. He asked Sen-

CHARTERS OF
(Special to The Republican)
CLIFTON, Ariz., Jan. 12. Three
Western Federation of Miners char
ters were dispatched from Clifton by i
express today to the headepjarters of
the organization in Denver, Earlier in
the day, deputations from the Clifton,
Morenci and Metcalf ioca:s, visted
Sheriff J. G. Cash and formally turned
over to him the tangible evidence of
their affiliation with the federation.
The surrender" of these charters
marked the passing of federation dom
ination in the Clifton-Morenci district
and it is believed to have opened the
way to a speedy settlement of the
strike which has been in progress for
several months and which has thrown
from four to five thousand men out of
employment during the time.
There is now every reason to be
lieve that not later than tomorrow the
mine managers will have some propo
sition to offer the strikers and it is
believed that a committee fmm the
men will be named to confer with the
managers. The executive committee
of the strikers today announced that
the next move must come from the
managers as the men had complied
with every request of the managers.
Optimism prevails all over the dis
trict and the end of the strike is looked
for within a very few days and cer
tainly before the end of the month.
That the men will be granted sub
stantial increases, probably on the
basis of the prevailing price of copper,
is believed. The managers in El Paso
today admitted they had received for
mal notification of the surrender of the
charters, but beyond announcing they
would confer tomorrow, would make
no further comment.
Quiet prevails in the district. The
assessment work on the claims of the
Detroit Copper Company has been
completed and the men imported to do
the work have left the district. Cnited
Stales .Marshal Dillon and his deputies
have also left Clifton. Marshal Dillon
before leaving announced that, neither
he nor his men had experienced the
least bit of trouble while enforcing the
federal court order restraining the
strikers from interfering with the per
formance of the assessment work.

Failure of Italians to Send
Help to Montenegren Cap
ital Makes Capture ot
. City Seem Certain Fight
ing on All Sides
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON Jan. 12. Cettinje, the
capital of Montenegro, now seems
likely to suffer the fate of Belgrade,
and British observers are already ask
ing anxiously what menace the con
quest of Montenegro is likely to hohl
over the allies at Saloniki.
Fighting is going on all around
Cettin-je, the small town which nearly
a year ago ceased to be the seat of the
Montenegrin government. Never be
fore in the long history of the little
Montenegrin kingdom has it been
compelled to 'now to a foreign con
queror, but there seems little hope that
it can long, wifhstand the overwhelm
ing strength of General Koeves in men
and sjuns.
As in Serbia's case, the entente
press finds it inexplicable why Italian
assistance was not sent long ago to
Lovcen, which, it is said, could have
beer rendered impregnable with a
comparatively small force and some
heavy guns. The reduction of Monte
negro, the press points out, will en
able Austria not only to "nter the
Adriatic, but also threaten the flank
of any advance from Saloniki and pre
vent ary effective move by the
entente forces through Albania.
For Italy the new Austrian success
has a most serious aspect. The long,
narrow Italian peninsula is peculiarly
vulnerable to an attack from the sea.
Any really great Austrian naval base
in the magnificent harbor of Cattaro
would have been impossible without
Lovcen, but under the new circum
stances Austrian possession of Cat
taro is almost as great a menace to
Italy as the German conquest of
Calais would have been .to Great
Britain.
While attention is centered upon the
developments on the Adriatic coast, it
is announced from Rome that two
Italian transports, the Brimlisi and
Citta di Palermo, last wek struck
mines and sank. A mujority of the
crews was saved.
On the Russian front the Austrian
official communication records re
newed desperate attacks by- the Rus
sians on the Bessarabian frontier, but
insist that the attacks everywhere
were repulsed. The Petrograd com
munication Is silent on the subject,
but the Russians usually withhold
mention of their movements until they
are- well on the road to corrrvletion.
There have been no important devel
opments on the western front. The
blowing up of a large German muni
tions depot near Lille is admitted in
the German communication. Accord
ing to one account, this was due to
a British air raid. Th English press
believes that the cautious working of
the German communication conceals
a disaster of large proportions. There
is a great spirit of optimism in both
British and French dispatches from
the western front, the correspondents
expressing the firm conviction of the
allied generals that there can be no
possibility of any successful German
offensive anywhere in the western
lines.
The correspondent of Reuters sends
from British headquarters an inter
view with an . unnnamed prominent
staff officer, who was quoted as pay
ing: "Wc now have full information

them whether the matter in epiestion
is indecent or immoral.
F. M. Wilson, United States district
attorney, insisted that only portions of
the articles and chapters had been
placed in evidence.
Judge Van Valkenburgh then
passed upon the matter submitted, in
dicating parts of articles and portions
of certain chapters in the book which
might be admitted. These then we're
read to the jury by the attorneys for
the prosecution. Many of the pas
sages read contained charges of im
morality against members of the Cath
olic clergy.
Witnesses from St. Louis and Kan
sas City identified newspapers and
a book which wcire alleged to contain
the printed matter in question as hav
ing been received by them through
the mails, after which the government
rested its case.
Mrs. JCTlnie J. Wilson of St. Louis,
who testified she was a stenographer
employed by Paul Bakewell, an at

of a book bearing the title, "The Pope,

Number of Those Massacred
In Box Canyon West of

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
EL PASO, Tex., Jan. 12. The
number of foreigners massacred in
the Box Canyon west of Santa Ysa
bel Monday afternoon was placed at .
nineteen late today. It was author
itatively stated that General Pablo
Lopez, a Yaqui chieftain closely al
lied with General Francisco Villa,
commanded the massacre. About 20
bandits attacked the train, it was
said, while 200 were grouped as a
reserve to one side of the right of
way.
Arrivals from Chihuahua City said
that a troop train of twenty cars
conveying between 500 and 1,000
Carranza troops had preceded the
mining company special by about
fifteen minutes, leaving the capital.
The engine and two cars of this
train were said to have been derailed
by the bandits in order to stop the
passenger train of Americans. What
became of the Carranza soldiers if
they were in the military train could
not be learned here.
A mass meeting called for this af
ternoon for the stated purpose of
protesting against th' attitude of the
United States government toward
the Mexican situation, and against
the Mexican de facto government
for its alleged failute to protect
Americans traveling under promises
of protection, was postponed when
it was learne'd that the funeral train
bringing the nineteen bodies of the
slain to the border would not arrive
before midnight. It will be held to
morrow, it was said.
The name of Thomas Johnson, late
today, was added to the list of vic
tims and that of J. Adams was
changed to Joe Enders of Hayden,
Ariz., making nineteen victims.
Reports of those arriving from the
capital today were to the effect that
the body of each victim bears a bul
let wound in the forehead, in addi
tion to other wounds. It was said
that the head of C. R. Watson was
completely blown off.
Officials of the Mexico Northwest
ern railroad said that the Carranza
government was not attempting to
protect 'the Madera company's prop
erties at Madera and Pearson. It
was said that a troop train carrying
about forty men was sent from
Juarez toward Pearson and Madera
about 6:30 yesterday, but returned a
few hours later.
Delay in transportation of the bod
ies of the victims to the border here
caused much dissatisfaction. Late
today the bodies had not left the'
capital, although two other passenger
trains had come north during the
day. Arrangements had been made
for the passage of the bodies upon
arrival directly across the river to

"I did not arrest Keane or thetither

responsible for that. He succeeded tne
