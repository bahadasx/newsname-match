Km (HI WIFE
OF AUEGED HWttltER
CARRIE OLSON, WHO MARRIED
PRICE OF MINNEAPOLIS, NOW
ON TRIAL, WAS DOMESTIC IN
WARD COUNTY FAMILIES.
Considerable interest is being taken
in the Price murder trial in this vicin­
ity, which is now in progress in Min­
neapolis, because of the fact that
Price's present wife for several years
was a resident of Berthold, a town lo­
cated on the Great Northern 22 miles
west of Minot. She was Miss Carrie
Olson, a beautiful Norwegian girl. She
worked as a .domestic five years ago
in Berthold'a best families. She was
first employed at the home of Mr.
Stevenson, the banker, and later at
considerable intelligence and learned
considerate intelligence and learned
to write on the typewriter, later going
into the attorney's office. She gradu­
ated from a Fargo business college
and worked as a stenographer in Min­
neapolis, where she met Price, a prom­
inent businessman.
Price is charged with murdering his
former wife in order to get her $23,
000 fortune. After he became admin­
istrator of the estate he married Car­
rie Olson.
Charles Etqhison, who was arrested
charged with being an accessory to
the crime, says he accompanied Price
and his wife to a cliff near Minneapo­
lis and that Price stopped the car,
saying it needed repairs. He says
that Price told his wife to get out of
the car while he fixed it and that he
pushed her violently over the cliff and
shoved the dog down after her. He
says the fall did not kill the woman
and that Price followed her down and
beat in her skull with a rock. He
says he shut his eyes as he heard the
thud of the rock against the woman's
skull. Etchison says Price was to
give him $3,000 for testifying that the
woman had fallen over the cliff, as she
tried to keep her dog from going over.
Of Course It's Cold.
Of course this is cold weather. The
ice man must harvest his crop and no­
body wants an ice failure. Did you
ever see a January in North Dakota
when it wasn't a trifle cold? We told
you last fall that we were going to
have some snug weather and advised
you to invest in storm sash and storm
doors. Many of you heeded our warn­
ing and invested a small outlay and
you have more than saved the cost in
your fuel bill. If you are still heat­
ing up the whole out of doors, why not
come in and invest? Next time you
are in town, come in and let's talk
over those improvements you are fig­
uring on making out on the farm. The
material for many of the best build­
ings in the country was furnished by
our yard. Rogers Lumber Co., H. S.
Johnson, Manager.
Only Survivor of Berthold Tragedy
Recovering.
Willard, the nine-year-old son of
Harry Arnold of Berthold, the only
survivor of the ill fated school bus in
which five boys and the driver were
killed when struck by a G. N. train,
was brot to St. Joseph's hospital in
this city for a rather difficult opera­
tion. The boy suffered a fracture of
the arm near the shoulder, the bone
being shattered so badly that it was
necessary to bind the broken ends
with a silver plate. The boy will re­
cover fully in time, but it will be
many months.
WILTON COAL NINE
URGES! IN STATE
YEARLY PRODUCTION IS 200,000
TONS—EVERY MODERN DE­
VICE IN COAL MINING IN USE
AT PLANT.
Wilton, N. D., Jan. 10—Not many
North Dakota communities enjoy the
advantages and prosperity which has
been heaped upon the people of Wil­
ton and vicinity. Besides being privi­
leged to live along the fertile Mis­
souri slope, one of the garden spots
of North Dakota, the residents of this
section are reaping benefits from the
largest industrial plant in the state.
The lignite coal mine of the" Wash­
burn Lignite Coal company, which is
situated in Wilton, is famous the state
over because of the quality of lignite
produced. No other mines in the state
can boast of any superior grade of
native fuel, and the local plant being
centrally located and within easy ac­
cess to all parts of the state, is in a
position to furnish coal to all parts of
North Dakota at a price that defies
competition, the cost at the mine be­
ing from $1.50 to $2.00 per ton not
only so, but the immense plant is
equipped with every device in the line
of machinery to take care of a vast
amount of coal. The mine is by far
the largest in the state and has a
large vein of coal at the disposal of
the operators which will insure Wil­
ton lignite on the market many years
after the youngest reader of this ar­
ticle, has been called from this mun­
dane spheroid.
8At
the present time
the mine is forking 400 men in all de­
partments, and these men are expert
miners, with experienced and compe­
MSi"
tent overseers. Eleven miles of track­
age is required to reach the extreme
underground workings, and three elec­
tric driven motors handle the coal to
the foot of the shaft, where it is
speedily brought to the surface and
loaded into railroad cars by the latest
models of box car loaders. Both the
Soo and Northern Pacific railroads
run into Wilton and at this season of
the year special trains for the handl­
ing of the mammoth output, arc made
up at the mine, and Wilton's famous
lignite is shipped to all parts of the
state/
Last year the production of coal at
the local mine amounted to 200,000
tons, being nearly one-half the entire
output of the combined mines of
North Dakota. A yearly pay roll of
$200,000 to the men employed, is a big
item in Wilton. financial circles, and
there is no such thing as hard times in
the Lignite City, with the revenue
from the product of the fertile pra
iries and the rich deposits of coal un
derneath the surface.
Aside from running the largest
mine in North Dakota, the Washburn
Lignite Coal Co. farms nearly 1,000
acres of land and this year marketed
from 350 acres, almost 10,000 bushels
of wheat and from 90 acres of flax
threshed 1500 bushels. A bumper
crop of oats was stored in the com­
pany's big granaries which will be
used for feed, as a large number of
mules and horses are utilized in car­
rying on the immense business.
The men employed at the mines are
well cared for and many of them live
in company cottages close to the mine,
and every occupant has a plot of
ground which is used for garden pur­
poses. A well heated and lighted
boarding and rooming house accom­
modates the unmarried men and dur­
ing the winter months this large
building is filled to overflowing, as
many as 100 miners being tr.ken care
of. A neat school building for the
children of the employes of the mine
is presided over by a competent teach
er and the entire policy of the man­
agement is to make the men who are
on the pay roll happy and contented.
Our old friend, Perry Stockwell, of
Burlington is in town today on his
way to Martin, N. D., where his sis­
ter, Mrs. Anna Varey, is very ill from
chronic bronchitis, with little hopes
for her recovery. Mrs. Varey is well
known in Minot, where she owns con­
siderable property. Mr. Stockwell
raised a nice crop and has not sold a
bushel of his grain. The wheat from
the time he threshed has advanced
31 cents a bushel.

Mrs. Myers Proves Delightful Hostess
The Wednesday Musical club was
entertained at the beautiful suburban
home of Mrs. Phil W. Myers Wednes­
day evening and despite the exceed­
ingly cold weather, a large number
gathered. Mrs. J. B. Taylor had
charge of the program, a number of
interesting papers being read. Plans
for the future good of the club were
discussed.
Mrs. Myers, assisted by Mrs. Sweet,
served delightful refreshments and
the evening passed altogether too

SCARLETT SECURES
TEMPORARY QUARTERS
FIRM WHOSE STOCK WAS WIPED
OUT BY FIRE TELEGRAPHS OR­
DER FOR NEW STOCK AND
WILL RE-OPEN IN BRAUER
BLOCK.
It's hard to keep a good concern
down.
Scarlett's Office Outfitting Co. was
wiped out of business temporarily by
a fire Tuesday morning. Colonel
Scarlett, the energetic Scotchman,
arose from a sick bed at St. Joseph's
hospital, came back on the firing line
and telegraphed for a complete new
stock. Within 24 hours after the lire
had started, he had leased temporary
quarters in the basement of the
Brauer block and will reopen his store
Saturday morning. A bit of adversity
appears to be as good for the Colonel
as a tonic, for he was around Wed­
nesday morning giving orders with
as much vim as a youth.
Long live the hardy old Scot and
the Scarlett Office Outfitting Co.
RANEY HRD FOR
DEPUTY AUDITOR FOR MANY
YEARS WILL BE A CANDIDATE
FOR THE OFFICE—L. J. THOMP­
SON WILL RETIRE.
Raney W. Kennard, who for eight
years has been connected with the
county auditor's office, in the capacity
of deputy during the greater portion
of the time, will be a candidate for
county auditor, to succeed L. J.
Thompson, who is serving his second
term. Mr. Thompson has made a fine
record but he has decided to engage in
work which will permit him to remain
out of doors more of the time.
There is no one in the county bet­
ter fitted to hold the position of audi­
tor than Mr. Kennard. The duties of
a county auditor are varied and the
position is one of the hardest to fill in
the entire -county. Mr. Kennard is
familiar with every phase of the work.
He is accommodating, hardworking
and strictly honest. From every part
of the county come assurances of the
heartiest support and indeed it would
not be surprising if Mr. Kennard had
no opposition whatsoever.
Dr. McCannel Wil1 Take Postgraduate
Course.
Dr. A. J. McCannel, whose office and
equipment were burned when the
Roell-Blakey block went up in smoke
Tuesday nforning, has arranged to
leave Monday for New Orleans, where
he will spend three months taking a
post graduate course in the Tulane
University. He will return to this
city to re-open offices some time dur­
ing Auril. He will be accompanied
to the south by Mrs. McCannel.
BOARD PLANS HIGH
CALLS FOR PLANS FOR BUILD­
ING NOT TO EXCEED COST OF
$125,000—PLAN TO BUILD CEN­
TRAL UNIT THIS YEAR.
The board of education of the Minot
Special School District No. 1, is plan­
ning on building a new High school
building this year and at the regular
meeting Tuesday night asked for the
submission of plans and specifications
for such.
The building is to be located on the
Central school grounds. The board
proposes to have the plans call for a
three unit building and will build the
central unit this year at a cost not to
exceed $75,000, which amount of mon­
ey is now available for building pur­
poses. The central unit will provide
for the main auditorium, gymnasium,
shower baths for the boys and girls
and large swimming pool. The other
units will be added to either side as
soon as the additional money is avail­
able and will provide additional rooms.
The Minot schools are in a very
crowded condition and the new build­
ing is needed badly. The city has
been growing very rapidly and with it
the schools.
The school board hopes later to add
a central heating plant in a fire-proof
building, located at an ejual distance
from the three buildings, the heating
plant to be located in the basement
with provisions made for the manual
training department on the first floor
and the domestic science department
on the second floor. They propose to
provide for the advanced course of
manual training soon by the installa­
tion of metal lathes and forges.
Final action on the question of
building was deferred until the meet­
ing of Monday, Jan. 17, as two mem­
bers of the board, G. S. Reishus and
Martin Jacobson, were absent.
FARMER MAKES WOH
DERfUL RECORD
HERMAN ABRAHAMSON AND
TWO SONS GROW 37,400 BUSH­
ELS OF WHEAT, OATS, BAR
LEY, RYE AND FLAX AT FARM
NEAR MINOT,
Herman Abrahamson, a hustling
farmer living ten miles east of Minot,
made a record on his farm last sea­
son that we do not believe was equal
led in the state. With the help of two
sons, aged 16 and 18 years, he grew
22,000 bushels of wheat, 1900 bushels
of rye, 500 bushels of flax and 13,000
bushels of oats and barley. He hired
one man two months during seeding
time at a cost of $60. He has market­
ed $16,000 worth of wheat and has 6,
000 bushels left, besides all of his
flax, oats, barley and rye. His thresh
bill amounted to $3500. He is still
hauling grain and holding for a high
er price. Mr. Abrahamson bought the
Gallagher farm adjoining his own.
FARGO ATTORNEY I
ENTtRS
BEN LESK, PROMINENT YOUNG
BARRISTER, FORMS PARTNER
SHIP WITH GREENLEAF &
WOOLEDGE LATTER WITH­
DRAWS FROM FIRM OF THOMP­
SON & WOOLEDGE.
G. S. Wooledge has withdrawn from
the well known law firm of Thompson
& Wooledge to form a partnership
with D. C. Greenleaf, one of Minot'.
oldest and most prominent attorneys.
Ben Lesk of Fargo will be associated
with Greenleaf and Wooledge. Mr.
Thompson will continue his large
practice in the present location, the
new Jacobson block. The Courier
News of Fargo has the following to
say regarding the change:
One of Fargo's most popular and
hardest working young men leaves
next week to establish himself profes­
sionally in a new location. Mr. Ben
Le« k,. who has been for two and a half
year's connected with" the firm of Law­
rence & Murphy, goes to Minot to be­
come the junior member of a new
firm, Greenleaf, Wooledge & Lesk. Mr.
G. S. Wooledge has severed his con­
nection with Thompson & Wooledge
to join with the new firm.
Mr. Lesk came with his father to
Fargo when he was but a lad, and the
family having Escaped from the tyr­
anny of Russia, he appreciated the op­
portunities of America. Mr. Lesk is
considered one of the best cultured
young men of the city, being a grad­
uate of Georgetown university in the
District of Columbia. His social and
fraternal affiliations here are of the
best, and a host of friends wish him
well and predict success for him in
the new field and firm. He is con­
sidered honest, capable and is a very
hard working and diligent young at­
torney.
WEST OF MiSSl
LURA BETTINA, OWNED BY MA­
JOR E. S. PERSON, PRODUCED
MORE THAN HER OWN WEIGHT
IN BUTTER DURING 1915.
Lura Bettina, Major E. S. Person's
champion Guernsey cow, produced
925 pounds of butter during the year's
test, which ended Jan-. 10, which is
just 25 pounds more than the weight
of the champion cow. By the results
of this test it has been shown that
Lura Bettina is not only the state's
champion Guernsey cow, but she is
the champion west of the Mississippi.
A year ago, as a five-year-old, she
won the state's Guernsey record, pro­
ducing 632.02 pounds of lyutterfat and
10,992.8 pounds of milk. In the year
just ended she produced 770.04 pounds
of butterfat and 14,001.2 pounds of
milk and 925 pounds of butter. At the
present market value of choice dairy
butter, this product would be worth
$370.
Lura Bettina comes near being
worth her weight in gold. Since the
Major has owned her, she has pro­
duced two heifers and a ma'e, a very
valuable animal. It is hard to arrive
at tlje actual value of a cow like Lura
Bettina. Cows with records not so
good have been sold at figures rang­
ing from $1500 to $2500.
Lura Bettina is kept at the Major's
fine country home, Elmwood Farm,
three miles west of Minot. J. A. Sor
ensen, the efficient superintendent of
the farm, is proud of the record he has
made with the cow. He fed her no
special rations. She got just what
the Major's other cows got, which is
a good balanced ration of ground oats,
barley, bran and oil meal, with a few
roots at the latter end of the test, and
silage and alfalfa hay. The cow was
never forced but she produced five
times as much as the ordinary dairy
cow.

Thermometer Reached Low Point.
The weather man is giving us some
good old-fashioned winter weather this
week. Sometime during Wednesday
forenoon the government thermometer
according to W. I. Ferris, of the wea
ther bureau, reached the point of 44
degrees below zero. Early in the morn­
ing it reached 41 below but grew cold
er as the day advanced. The thermom
eter registered 47 degrees below this
morning.
Not many farmers have been in dur­
ing the week and we presume they
are sticking pretty close to their hot
lignite fires. The weather was not
particu'arly disagreeable in the city,
tho we noticed that the crowds that
stood about the northwest corners
of the buildings discussing politics
and war, were not very large and peo­
ple stepped around lively. Coal men
are doing a nice business, some of
them getting rid of a car load of coal
daily, and they are praying for the
cold snap to keep up for several
weeks.
There was little actual suffering
There is plenty of fuel and if any of
our people need clothing or food, all
they have to do is to notify the au­
thorities. Three little boys from a
family on the North side went to
school Wednesday morning, without
any underclothing. They were very
cold but managed to keep from freez­
ing. Mrs. John Campbell, who heads
the Associated Charities, learned of
their plight and bought some good
warm underclothing for them.
One little youngster who had quite
a long distance to walk to school, suf­
fered slightly from a frozen hand
and foot. A good many of our citizens
are nursing ears and noses that were
nipped, but none suffered any ill con­
sequences. This is fine winter wea­
ther, just cold enough to whet up one's
appetite and make him think of last
summer's wages.
Pc.rtal Curlers Take First Games.
Tho Porta' curlers visited this city
Wednesday and took our champion
rink into camp to the tune of 13 to
11. The game was very fast. Minot
will send a team to Portal later, when
it is expected that the tables will be
turned. The Minot team comprised
Rev. P. W. Erickson. skip Pence, Mc
Clure and A. J. McCannel. Portal—

Donnybrook Man Out-of-Door En­
thusiast.
Joseph Johnson, the Guernsey King
from Donnybrook, came down to see
The Birth of a Nation Wednesday.
Mr. Johnson for years was in the
banking business at Donnybrook, but
he is now doing a lucrative auto bus­
iness, handling the Ford and Stude
baker cars. He is one of the officers
of the Guernsey Breeders' Associa­
tion and has some of the best cattle
in the state at his big farm. He is
preparing to attend the Mid-winter
Fair. Joe has slept out of doors for
years and he is perfectly comfortable
in his sleeping bag in the coldest
weather. "It makes a fellow feel fine
to sleep out in the open the year
round," he says. "I never mind it.
The cold weather has a tendency to
make one's blood course thru his veins
faster and I never know what a cold
is any more."
Reighart With the Champlin Imple­
ment Co.
W. H. Reighart, the well known
auto man, has been secured to manage
the automobile department of the
Champlin Implement Co. the coming
season. Mr. Reighart is one of the
most capable automobile men in the
northwest and the Champlin Co. is
fortunate in securing his services.
Ray Dierdorff of Surrey will assist
in the machinery department of that
concern during the coming season.
The Champlin Implement Co. handle
Studebaker cars, which have won an
enviable reputation.
Commandery Ball Feb. 11.
Preparations are being made for

many coming from out of town. The
Knights will appear in full uniform.
An elaborate banquet is being ar­
ranged and Sonju's orchestra will fur­

FRANK AND HASSQ.
BUY GRAHAM UTERES!
CHARLES F. GRAHAM DISPOSES
OF STOCK IN LELAND DEPART­
MENT STORE AND WILL RE­
TURN TO FORMER IOWA HOME.
G. O. Frank and G. A. Hassel, of the
Frank & Graham Co., have bought the
stock of Chas. F. Graham in the Le­
land Department store. Mr. Graham
will soon return to his old home, La
moni, la., to make his future home.
Mr. Graham came to North Dakota
fourteen years ago and was employed
for years at the old New York store
on North Main street. Several years
ago he engaged in business with Mr.
Frank, taking over the Leland Depart­
ment store. He has been very suc­
cessful. Mr. Graham has a host of
friends who will wish him wel1 wher­
ever he may be.
Three years ago Mr. Hassel came
to Minot, acquiring an interest in the
Leland Department store. He has
proved a very valuable man to the
concern, and he deserves a large share
of the credit for the rapid growth of
the store.
Mr. Frank, the other member of the
concern, is one of our most conserva­
tive businessmen, and he has made a
phenomenal success of the business in
which he has been engaged. He is one
of the pioneers of the city and enjoys
a wide acquaintance and has numer­
ous friends over the northwest.
The Leland store is one of Minot's
fastest growing institutions and the
firm is contemplating a number of
improvements that will give our city
an even better store than the Leland
is today.
Fuller Babe Passed Away.
The little daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

parents are heartbroken at the loss
of their little daughter. They have
the sympathy of a wide circle of

Police Matron Ordinance Passed Sec­
ond Reading.
Provision for creating the office of

OWBELLS FAMILY
LOST IN STORM
FRANK BAIR AND FAMILY ON
WAY HOME FROM CHURCH,
WIND UP AT STRAW STACK-
LATER REACH NEIGHBOR'S
BADLY FROZEN.
Bowbells, N. D., Jan. 10.—Frank
Bair and family of the Westminster
district, were quite badly frozen last
Tuesday night while on their way
from church. They live about a mile
from the church, and as usual started
Out in their sleigh for home. They
had a straight road to follow and in
spite of the raging blizzard thought
they could make it with ease, as they
were td go with the wind. However,
the horses left the road after travel­
ing some distance from the church
and followed a trail leading to a straw
pile. After the straw pile was reach­
ed they knew they were lost'and Mr.
Bair got out of the rig to look for
another road. None could be found,
so after traveling for about an hour
longer they wound up at the Dan
Coons farm residence and spent the
night there. Mr. Bair was quite
badly frozen about the face and hands,
Mrs. Bair had her feet frosted quite
badly and the children were more or
less frozen. One of the Bair boys who
staid at home thought that his father
might have gotten lost as he had not
arrived on schedule time, so went out
to look for the rig. He, too, had a
hard time moving in the blizzard and
finally landed at one of his neighbors'
farm homes and spent the night there.
