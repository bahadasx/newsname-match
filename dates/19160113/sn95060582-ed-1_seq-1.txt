A National, State and County
System of Highways
A County System of High
ways Constructed by
Issuing County
Bonds.
.It is difficult to meet an objec
tion of which I have not heard,
and equally difficult to imagine
that any sane mind in this day
and age of the world's progress,
can be out of line and out of
sympathy with the great move
ment to issue bonds for road
building, for this will solve the
problem of sensible road building
in this state. That is to say, by
the county-wide system instead
of the unsatisfactory 8 mile spec
ial road district plan. The coun
ty system means a system of
roads that begin "somewhere" 1
and go "somewhere," whereas, j
the road district plan, as a rule,
begins "nowhere" and goes "no
where." Besides, the county
plan will secure roads at a mini
mum cost to the taxpayer. Unlike
the old system which laid all the
burden of road building on the
broad, shoulders of the farmer,
the new system taxes everybody
alike, with the result that the
farmer will, as a rule, pay much
less than one-half the road taxes.
It is absurd to regard this as. a
tax at all, because it is really :the
best investment, and -will pay. a
greater rate of interest, than any
investment possible to make.
Suppose for the sake of argu
ment, that this was a great trol
ley system of; roads, reaching
every part of your country, and
'connectingf. e, verfpwn. . and vil
lage i..thegountry, ancl connect
ed witn a mmfip'lme reaching
across the state, and suppose such
a system could be built for the
sum proposed to be invested in
permanent roads, instead of the
millions which such a system of
roads would in fact cost you,
which would be preferable, and
the greater benefit to your people
and county? .
There is not a shadow of doubt
that such a proposition, to-wit:
t Ive supposed ' trolley system,
would meet with instant approval,
and yet. if you got it, you would
simply have a convenient system,
indeed, but one which you would
use but rarely, and then pay ex
travagantly for the privilege. In
Vol. 32.
JOHNS, APACHE GO.. ARIZONA, JANUARY 13,
other words, you would be issuing
bonds in order that you might
build a road system over which
you would have to pay toll every
time you went anywhere, where
as, by the permant hard-surfaced
road system you would have roads
covering the same ground, but
over which you could travel a i
dozen times to where you would
go once on the trolley. And you
would be travelling on a free
road, all it would cost you would
be it maintenance. Do not for
i. et, however, that if you had a
vast trolley system of roads you ;
would have to maintain it, keep j
it m repair, ana pay tne interest
on the investment, or it would
speedily go into the hands of a
Receiver. Furthermore, the trol
ley system, vast and comprehen
sive as I have imagined it, would
add but little, if any, to the value I
of the farm lands of the county, I
especially those not located in the ?
immediate vicinity of a station. !
Whereas, theproposed. permanent
road system, will enhance the val
ue of every acre of land on or
near such roads to a very large
extent, and every acre of land in
the county will, be enhanced in
value to some extent.
But, some may say the proposed
road or roads do not affect me, be
cause I have no land fronting the
same, lnis is a mistake, because
you cannot add ten or twenty mil
lion dollars .of value to the prop
erty in your' . county without af
fecting jbh'e interests of every
man and woman in the county.
Of course", like all public improve
ments, the land immediately
fronting on the road is very large
ly benefited beyond that more re
motely located. This inequality
is. inherent in all questions of
public improvements, but, if the
proposed bond issues will not cov
er' all the roads in the county at
this time, long before the bonds
shall have matured, values will
be so enhanced, the people will
liave realized tne benefits of good
roads to such an extent, that there
will be no difficulty in building
other lines, and thus placing you
upon an equality with your neigh
bor. In other words the only
chance you will ever have to en
joy the benefits of a good road by
your house will not come about by
opposition to your neighbors, but
by joining and cooperating with
them, and when your time comes
your neighbor will reciprocate
and join you in securing a like
benefit.
Do not forget that by the time
your county system is complete
we shall undoubtedly have a sys
tem of National Highways, built
and maintained by the National
Government, and a system of
State highways, built and main
tained by the State, with which
your county system will connect
and become a part of, and then,
indeed, you will have roads that
"go somewhere". Nothing is
more surely written in the book
of fate than that we are coming
to this blessed consumation.
I adjure the people everywhere
and especially of .every county
through which the National Old
Trails Road runs, to build such
county systems, and thereby se
cure the benefit of 73,974 miles
of permanent highways, for that
is just what it means. By build
ing, say one hundred and fifty
miles of road in your county you
secure all the benefit of 73,974
miles of road, and thus secure the
travel and traffic of a Continent
through your county.
