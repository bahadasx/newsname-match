premier In the litter's announcement
that the Santa Ysalbel victims went
Into, Mexico In tho fnro of a warning
that they would do so at their own
peril.
From Mexican Ambassador Arre-
dondo comes word to Secretary Inns
ing deploring the assassinations,
pledging action to revenge them and
to protect Americans In the future.
The Lewla resolution read:
"Resolved, by the senute, house

(By United Press Leased Wire.)
Washington, Jan. 13. General
Carranza'e Mexican government
stood on trial today, facing Its cru
cial test, as a result of the bloody
murder of IS Americans by bandits
at Santa Ysabel.
Upon the first chief's ability or
Inability to punish the murderers de
pends the administration's course In
Mexican affairs. President Wilson
and the etate department awaited
word as to Carranza's steps to cap
ture the marauders. This word was
expected today; in fact, press reports
Indicated that the chieftain had al
ready sent a iband of troopers In pur
suit. Indications wero that Carranza
would seek to satisfy the administra
tion In its request for punishment of
the bandits, for aocurlty for other
Americans south of the Rio Grande,
and for protection of vast American
mining properties. ,
The Mexican legation gave assur
ances that Secretary Lansing's sug

King Victor Emmanuel Is
Contemplating Going to Re

tempt to Save Cettinje
Rome, Jan. 13. Italian soldiers
may be ordered to relieve the hard
pressed Montenegrins within two
days, In an effort to save Cettinje
from almost certain capture iby the
Austrlans. The subject, it Is be
lieved, was considered today in a con
ference to which King Victor Em
manuel summoned military chiefs
and cabinet officers. It is known that
Montenegrin affairs were discussed.
The Montenegrin crown prince
and his wife reached Rome from
Cettinje Just before King Victor Em
manuel arrived from the front after
an eight months' absence from Rome.
The prince visited Foreign Minis
ter Sonnino and then King Victor
Emmanuel and presented the appeal
of the Montenegrin king. Nicholas,
for help.
It Is rumored that Qneen Helena
of Italy, daughter of King Nicholas,
participated In the conferences. This
may cause a startling change in Bal
kan affairs. It was reported that she
telegraphed the king alarming re
ports concerning the Austrian Inva
sion of- Montenegro, which resulted
In bringing him home from his ownl
battle lines.
SNOW STORM CLAIMS ONE
VICTDI IX PORTLAND
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
Portland, Jan. 13. One death
stood today as the record' of yester
day's cold and snow storm. Audley
R. MoClellon Is believed to be the
name of the victim. Found exhaust
ed and blue with cold in a pool room
yesterday afternoon, McClellon died
a few hours after reaching the emer
gency hospital. A card In his pocket
indicated that his home was In Los
Angeles.
The president, however, Is giving no
heed to Inflammatory suggestions
from any quarter. No change of
policy in the Mexican situation is
planned now, and the president Is
relying on Carranza to furnish ade
quate satisfaction and protection
against a recurrence of the massacre.
Confident that the first chief will
prove his power to punish the mur
derers and to protect foreigners in
the future, the administration la not
considering the clamor for Interven
tion. Intervention will be the last re
course, and then only, In an emer
gency where conditions were consid
erably worse than at present, and
Carranza's Impotence in the situation
had been conclusively proven. That
there Is a strong growth of tnterven
tlon sentiment In congress Is admit-
tde by leaders.
On the other hand, the latter are
trying to allay this spirit by point
ing out that Intervention would like-
ly unite all Mexican factions against
the "grlngoes." They claim that
years of guerilla warfare would fol
low such Intervention, with a heavy
loss of American Uvea from battling
and diseases of the troplo country.
In fact, Carranza previously warned
the administration that he would op
pose Intervention to his utmost.

Hi CIRCULATED
WITHOUT VALUE
Ban Francisco, Jan, 13. Nearly!
every peso of the paper money now
in circulation in Mexico Is valueless.
The de facto government recognized
by the United States government has
no authority under the constitution
to issue currency. This was the con
tention in the United States court
here today of Arthur Brand, San
Francisco attorney, who is defending
Jacinto Lucngo and Lorenzo Arl-
beaux. The Mexicans confessed to
stealing lithographic plates from the
Mexican treasury In 1914.
The Mexican congress at the time
the stone plates involved in the case
were stolen, could not have been in
session to authorize issuance of the
paper money, Brand declared, be
cause most of its members were in
confinement.
"The only valid paper money in
Mexico is that issued by (banks to
whom the Mexican congress gave
concessions," said Brand. "The only
way to prevent issuance of spurious
currency in Mexico Is to shoot the
printers." r
