ROME, Jan. 2. (By Mail.) Prin
cess Yolande is just finishing her task
of playing Sant.i Claus to all the
wornded soldiers in Home. In the hos
pitals where this beautiful 11-year-old
daughter of Italy's king could not ap
pear in person there are plenty of
Christmas reminders of her activity.
For months the Princess Yolade
worked with all her royal fourteen
years of enthusiasm for the Christmas
trees for wounded soldiers. Indeed she
was chairman of Ihe Christmas tree
committee, composed of young women
of the aristocracy whose thought and
care it was to see that every hopital
for the wounded was made bright and
Christmasy. With what fervor the
Princess Yolande worked Is evidenced
l y the wonderful Christmas trees laden
with gifts which gladdened those
havens for Italy's brava sons of bat
tie.
The royal family of Italy in a way
transferred all Its famed domesticity to
these guests within their gates, for
among the hospitals the one in the
tjuirlnal is regarded as tho especial
property of the royal children. When
the Princess Mafalda and Giovanni
bad birthday celebrations and the
Marionette theater from down town
was transferred to tho Qulrlnal, nil the
wounded soldiers who were able to
walk were Invited into see the I'.lrtb
Oay performance. They gave three
cheers for their royal hostesses and
the two little princesses were the hap
piest among them all.
The crown prince regards the wound
ed as his proteges. This Christnns,
tinged with sorrow on account of tho
absence of the king and the horrors
of war, was given over to theVolillers.
Last year the royal family, noted for
Its domestic simplicity, was not en
livened at Christmas on account of the
serious condition of the queen. The

maximum range Is four miles, and It cost, with two limbers and a caisson, $2,500. The Yale battalion consists of four

super-heated by a patent jacketed
stove. Yesterday when Smith started

fire began to burn.
