WHO ALL GOT FANCY
BOOZE JLASKS?
Alderman Probing Alleged Lojbby Trick of Harry Moir
Did Police and Health Officials Get "Compli
ments of Season, Etc." From Hotel Man?
Aldermen of council police com
mittee are looking into lobby tricks
of Harry Moir, owner and manager
New Hotel Morrison. They want to
know whether Moir gave out fancy
flasks of whisky to police and
health department officials as he did
among aldermen during holidays.
' Moirs high-style lodging house
and eating .place at Madison and
Clark streets is a, banner hotel on
several poinds. It has the largest
sidewalk canopy of any hotel, store
or bank .downtown;5 the canopy heing-
a violation of the city building code,
existing through special permit from
city council. The cabaret isn't a
common, trashy affair, where a duo,
trio or quartet does stunts. New Ho
tel Morrison has a regular chorus
of bare-shouldered girls, an octet,
eight lively, upstanding girls, who
sing, smile, shake their feet and
wander among the patrons and
shake hands.
Between Christmas and New
Year's day many city officials got a
card, of good wishes from Harry
