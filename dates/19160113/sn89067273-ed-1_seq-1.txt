Let us gladly fulfil.
And our talents improve,
By the patience of hope and the la

Glides swiftly away,
And the fugitive moment refuses to
stay.
The arrow Is flown, .
The moment is gone:
The millennial year
Rushes on to our view, and eternity's
here.

Enter into My Joy, and sit down on
My throne!

MR. BOTKIN REMEMBERS.
Fifty-six years ago tomorrow
morning, Jan. 11, 1865, about three
o'clock, I was taken prisoner at Bev
erly, West Virginia, by General Ros
ser's command of Confederate sol
diers. I was a member of the 8th Ohio
Cavalry. Most of, the regiment was
quartered there and most all were
captured. They used a little strategy
by quietly capturing our picket
posts. That once done without any
alarm made it an easy job. I was
prisoner only a few hours when
made my escape and started across
the country for Philllpt, some 30 or
40 miles northeast of us. I was two
days getting to that place, with no
difficulties to encounter. All I needed
was the ambition to travel. I bad that
Under the circumstances most any of
us could travel then. I had had a
previous taste of it that I had not
forgotten.
On the 25th of July. 1864, I was
taken prisoner atMartlnsburg, West
Virginia. I did not tare so well that
time. I was held until the night of
July 28 when I made my escape, but
did not. get out of the Confederate
lines until August 14th. Some Un
ion women, acquaintances, found
hiding place for me and so I escaped
without any serious story to tell.
was treated kindly by all officers and
men with whom I came in contact
Never stayed long enough to learn
much of what was in store for
prisoner.
JOSEPH B. BOTKIN.
Miss Janette White, principal of
the Marttnsburg schools, was one of
the speakers at .Farmers Week tn

A VETERAN BEE MAN.
Has Been With The State Association
More'n 13 Yean.
The Missouri Beekeepers' Asso
ciation was organized 13 years ago
and J. W. Rouse of Iexlr.o was elect
ed vice-president. Twelve days later
the president died and Mr. Rouse as
sumed his place and the Association
re-elected him to the same place from
year to year he filled the duties of
the office so well. He has never miss
ed a meeting of the organization and
of course was on hands at Columbia
last week. He Is an authority on bee
keeping and has 30 hives at his home
in his keeping at the present. We
suspect if more people would study
bees and keep bees, as does Mr. Rouse
it would be far better for fruit raising
in general in this State and over the
United States.
THE WEATHER.

went to 62 degrees above zero; a
warm day. But there was a change.
drop of 62 degrees by Thursday

A FIGHTING ROOSTER
Fulton, Mo., Jan. ,11. At the home
of Milton Brewer of Twelfth street
is a rooster reputed to be 18 years
old. The members of the family say
they know that Is the exact age. The
rooster is of a mongrel type, and
looks like he might be of the Buff
Orphington strain.
The Brewers do not know where to
class him, except that he has a strain
of fighting blood. He still retains
his pugnacious qualities and can
scrap with the best of them, despite
his advanced age. He has been a
tighter all his life, and, according to
the records, never has been vanquish
ed. This rooster dispells the general
opinion that they da not attain a ripe
old age, for as ages of poultry go he
could be classed in the senile age.
