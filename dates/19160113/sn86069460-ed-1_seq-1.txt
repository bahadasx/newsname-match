Co-operation among farmers
and all those concerned with far

was the keynote sounded at the
sessions yesterday of the Far

fully the plan of the commission.
Ten thoroughbred stallions of

by the commission and will be

They have all been placet! with

and it is believed the work will
grow materially each year.
Professor Hooper gave a his

in his talk, with an elaborate ac
count of leading horses in Ken

has proved valuable not only on
the race course, he said, but be

A talk of considerable interest
was that of Dr. Robert Graham
on "Forage Poisoning."
"Animals, infected with this
disease," said Dr. Graham, "us

two hours. I have found that
much of it existed where mouldy
corn was fed to the animals.

Portafes, New Mexico.

Portales, N. M.,
Mr. S. M. Jenkins,
Editor Record-Press,
Marion, Ky.,
Dear Marshall:
You will find enclosed check
for one dollar, ($1.00), for our
home paper another year and I
will try to write a short letter to
tell my friends how we are get
ting along away out here.
When we came here seven
years ago we could see nothing
but jack rabbits, now we can't
see anything but black cattle
with white laces or red cattle
with white faces. There is one
thousand head herein sight of
us all the time.
We are Itith well and netting
along fine. We have plenty of
everything and as fine a crop as
I ever saw anywhere. We have
a lot of feed ricked up and still
a lot in the field. We had to
take in Xmas on Monday. It
snowed all day and has been so
cold we haven't got anything
done but the feeding, milking,
cooking and eating. Sure the
eating comes four or five times a
day with us when we have to
stay in the bouse.
We had all kinds of nice fruit
this year, having set out a small
orchard a3 toon as we got here.
This year we had plums, peaches
apricots, grapes, blackberries
and goose-berries. We have ap
ple trees but they didn't bear
this year. We have a nice bunch
of cattle, horses, hog3, sheep
and 193 red hens. Looks like
that is enough for one man to
have to work and make feed for.
Oh! yes, I must tell about our
nice bunch of educated cats. I
can hardly write for watching
them through the window. Mr.
Newcom has Borne rabbits hang
ing on the hen-house for the
chickens. The cats will climb on
top of the hen-house, jump down
on them, their feet slipping, fall
to the ground and look up so
wishfully only to try again. I
don't think they have any claws
now.
Well, I promised to tell how
many eggs I sold this year, $112.

small family. , I don'; have any-
at the outbreak of this disease
on their farm. We tried thresh
ing the oats, feeding the grain
and staw seperately to animals.
In both instances after feeding,
it was discovered that the ani
mals were infected.
"Believing that possibly this
chicken manure was poisonous,
we collected some from the poul
try houses on the Experiment
farm and got negative results,
when it was pixed with whole
some food. After all our inves
tigations and experiments we
must admit that there was some
thing about forage poisoning of
which we know nothing.
"However, we have determin
ed that one of the most benefici
al things to be done to the feed
is to expose it to the light before
giving it to the animals. It is
possible also that water might
be a factor in transmitting the
disease, which means that it
should be guarded carefully.

A Recapitulation of His Work
Which Has Been Valuable
To Crittenden County,
Dear Mr. Editor: I want to
say something about what our
County Farm Agent has done for
our section of the country.
Mr. Bird came to Crittenden,
January, 1315, and has certainly
worked wonders for this county
with the farmers. Everyone
likes him, for he is a perfect
gentleman, always in a good
humor and ready and willing at
all times to help you and is busy
every moment. He has visited
about 1,200 farmers, talked with
them about their farm and help
ed them. He has attended about
200 farmers' meetings, has trav
eled on horseback 5.000 miles
and has vaccinated about 1.200
hogs, about 200 cattle and saved
92 per cent of the hogs.
The farmers, through him,
have used 225 tons of 15-percent
acid phosphate at a saving
of $6.50 per ton on their fertili
zer bills. There has been used
under Mr. Bird's direction .be
tween 200 and 300 tons of ground
limestone, with wonderful re
sults. He has a boys' pig club and
had a pig show which could not
be beat on earth. Some of these
pigs were taken to Louisville and
won premiums. He has held a
county fair with all kinds of
stock, poultry, field and garden
stuff. There were thousands of
people at thece shows. These
things were all worked up byl
Mr. Bird. This saving for the
farmers is a big item and I think
can be done only by co-operation,
which every farmer ought to
take pride in and which Mr. Bird
has brought them together in.
When our farmers go to improv
ing their land they will have
better crops, better stock and
co-operate in buying their fertil
izer, etc., and everything they
can not raise on their farms.
Then they can make and save
more money.
Mr. Bird has been worth
thousands of dollars to Critten
den county this year. I am sure
all the county agent are fine
men, but they don't make any
better than Mr. Bird is. He is
forever on the go and takes a de
light in telling any and every
one now to farm and how to
make it pay.-G. W. S Critten
den Co.-Kentucky Farming.
thing to do, only take care of my
chickens and visit my neighbors
when I want to. I have a nice
hone and buggy, also a saddle,
so I can go either way, when I
want to. We have some of the
best neighbors I ever saw and
we are all on equal footing, hav
ing plenty to eat and wear. We
all dress as nice out here as you
do in Kentucky and have just as
good a time, if not better.
Our first snow fell on Thanks
giving day. About two weeks
ago we had another. On Mon
day after Chtistmas it snowed
all day, some still on the ground.
This has been the coldest week
we've had this winter.
I suppose some of you in Ma
rion have heard about the sixty
thousand dollar creamery they
have built in Portales this fall.
They are making ice and butter,
but we all have ice at home now.
The first pound of butter sold
for seventeen dollars. The men
County Agent Saved Many Cholera
Infected Hogs With The Se
rum Treatment.
Editor of Kentucky Farming:
Hats off to Mr. Merriman! Our
County Agent surely stands solid
with the farmers in this county,
especially in my section. I think
his greatest work has been com
bating hog cholera. The first of
September this disease showed
itself in my hogs, and Mr. Mer
riman cam9 and vaccinated 81
hogs for me. Ten or twelve of
them were very sick with fever
up to 104 and 106, and Mr. Mer
riman did not want to vaccinate
them, but I told him I was will
ing to stand the expense, and I
did not lose a single hog. The
sick ones all got well. Two
weeks ago he treated twenty-five
hogs after another outbreak, and
not a single bog was lost. I con
sider his careful method of hand
ling the serum, and his knowl
edge of the work, is responsible
for me not having a single hog
with an abscess. I have been
with him a great deal in my
neighborhood, among my neigh
bors and helped him inoculate
other hogs, because wherever
he goes he saves the hogs.
Recently he treated a good-
sized lot of hogs for John Roth
enburger, weighing about sixty
to seventy pounds, five of them
being very sick and could not
gpf. up. Again -Mr. .Merriman
did not want to try to save the
sick begs, but I persuaded Mr.
Rotiienburger to stand the ex
pense, and he said. "Go-ahead."
Every hog got well, including
the sick ones.
He treated eleven hogs for A.
Haur.z, one was very sick, but
all have done splendidly. I was
with him again when he treated
W. Rothenburger's hogs, and
many other herds in the neigh
borhood.
He treated forty-one hogs for
H. D. Murphy, a big breeder,
and never lost one of them.
I am an optimist as a farmer,
but I realize that we need help
in many ways, and Mr. Merri
man has been of great assist
ance to us in our neighborhood
in treating hogs, helping us in
our crops and in aiding us in
selling. I think a good county
agent is aDsoiuteiy necessary in
every county. We would not do
without Mr. Merriman for any
thing in the world.
Yours truly,
H. SiMCOE, Jefferson Co., -Ken
tucky Farming.
began to bid on the first pound
of butter that was molded to see
who would get it So it went
for seventeen dollars and the
rest sells for 35c like all other
butter. If you all knew how
nasty some of the cream is out
here you wouldn't want any of
their butter. One can smell the
separators a quarter of a mile,
I have seen a million flies swarm
ing around them, so I make my
own butter at home, altho sand
must be healthy for I weigh one
fifty most of the time now.
How I do wish we could step
over and shake hands with al
our good neighbors and friends
all over Kentucky and have
good old talk with them.
Love and best wishes to all
and a happy New Year.

Public Utilities; Worst Sleet in
Years Covered Trees, Wires And
Everything That Was Out.
Thursday morning when day
ight broke a scene, beautiful to
behold but which came near be
ing a calamity, was revealed.
The drizzling rain which had be
gun to fall before dusk Wednes
day evening had frozen as it fell,
coating every exposed object
with a crystal sheet, applied
more evenly, and artistically than
master workman could, by any
means known to man, have done
in ages. And yet it was done
so quietly that many did not
know of it until they awoke and
looked out on a glistening sea
which sparkled like diamonds in
the sunlight
The concrete walks were soon
lined with youthful skaters rush
ing hither and thither on the
glassy surfaces.
Fortunately the sleet was not
heavy enough here to damage
the wires, cross-arms or poles of
the Marion Electric Light & Ice
Company, or the Home Tele
phone Company, to any great
extent, the troubles caused be
ing of only minor importance
and soon repaired. Our neigh
boring cities were not so lucky,
all suffered, some, more than
others.
The New Era had this to say:
Hopkinsville woke up yester
day morning to find that the
heaviest sleet fall for several
years had prevailed during the
night. Icicles were" everywhere
and many shade trees were
breaking down under the weight
of ice. One tree in the yard of
E. W. Henderson place was up
rooted and fell ' across the pave
ment and into the street Some
of the large trees on Court
Square were almost denuded of
limbs and from every direction
came in news that trees were
being ruined.
But the real damages were
done to telephone, telegraph and
electric light wires in every di
rection. The Kentucky Public Service
Co., was also hard hit The
Pembroke lights went out from
broken wires at 2 a. m., and the
Clarksville lights followed at
2:30. Many primary lines were
broken in the city, but the plant
was not put out of commission.
Three lines on Virginia, 2 on
Main, 3 on Seventh, 1 on Ninth.
1 on Jesup avenue and one on
First street snapped. The losses
will amount to several hundred
dollars.
Telegraph lines of course suf
fered heavy breakages, but bus
iness will suffer no very serious
interruptions."
TheMayfield Messenger said:
"The water and light company
cut off the current throughout
the city shortly after 7 o'clock
this morning, due to acc:dents to
the wires, and the city has been
without light or electrical power
most all day. It required a large
force during the day effecting
repairs so that the "juice" could
be turned on. Notice was sent
out from the water and light
plant that there would be "noth
ing doing" until late in the day,
and as a consequence The Mes
senger printing plant, and others
using power from the city plant
have been unable to "hop a lick."
Presses and typesetting machines
were "dead" until the electric
spark heralded its bright and
shining light and set in motion
again the wheels of commerce at
about 12:10 o'clock.
Big Detroit Company Chosen For
New Alliance By T. H. '
Ccchran & Co. .
NEW CARS HANDSOME
Local Organization Enthusiastic
Over Prospects For
Big Business.
Formal ratification has reached
this city of a contract whereby
the Maxwell car is to be handled
here by T. II. Cochran & Co.
This ratification was the con-
elusion of negotiations which had
been informally closed sometime
ago.
By the terms of this arrange
ment bringing as it does an
active and ample organization to
the Maxwell army, adequate rep
resentation for this popular
priced car is assured here. While
the present contract runs for one
year only, the solid permanence
of the parties interested gives
ground for the belief that rela
tions will be of indefinite length
of time. Such is, in fact a char
acteristic feature of Maxwell
agencies all over the country.
The entire organization of the
new local Maxwell store is en
thusiastic over the possibilities of ;
the alliance, .. .
"We took our time and looked
over the whole field," said T. H. .
Cochran. "We were out to pick
without the use of anything but
eold common sense, the car that
would make us the most money
during the season of 1916 and in
definitely into the future. We
believe we have gotten the best
one in the Maxwell. While the
dealer's margin of profit on a
$655 car is very small, the mark
et is immense and the volume of
sales assured, in case the car
stands up and gives satisfaction. .
We know that the Maxwell will
do this. The Maxwell cars of
last year and the season before
gained the reputation for beauty,
power and efficiency second to
none in the light car field.' This
year's car is handsomer, larger
and more efficient than ever be
fore, as we thoroughly convinced
ourselves before signing the con
tract Best of all, it fulfills in a
gratifying way its legitimate
heritage of sturdiness a quality
for which Maxwell have been
famous for many years of motor
ing history.
"We have made ample arrange
ments for a service department
designed to keep every Maxwell
car in our territory at its top "
efficiency all the time. In this
detail we have been greatly help
ed by the factory organization
which has developed a plan of
supply to dealers that has shown
itself adequate and prompt."
Maxwell demonstrating can
have already arrived at the local
salesroom and a considerable
shipment will be made,
soon from Detroit to take care of
orders already booked.
