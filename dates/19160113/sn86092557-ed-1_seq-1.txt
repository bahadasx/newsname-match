/'neys for the 24 former post office cm
!f ployes of the Fairmont post office, in
! dioted late yesterday afternoon by the
Federal grand Jury on a charge of
obstructing the passage of and detain
ing the delivery of the United States
l&ftllt In connection with post office
!'trouble in Fairmont last November,
<;Vand A. Howard Fleming, former post
master; Wilbur H. Brand, assistant
postmaster and Perry D. Burton, a
ggielerk, Indicted along with the post or
* flee clerks and carriers on a conspir
?: :facy charge, were In conference all
morning. It was stated that they were
making plans for the defense of those
Indicted and that some comprehensive
outline of the defense would be made
- public late today. However, at a late
hour this afternoon there had been no
? new action taken in the Fairmont
Incase. ?
Rumor has it that a motion will he
made to quash the conspiracy indict
ment^ and make a new indictment, in
cluding only the charge of obstructing
thovUnited States mail. No official
confirmation of this rumor could be
obtained, but it was circulating so gen
erally that it'was presumed it had a
rather substantial foundation.
Wien questioned today as to the
next Btep in the case, the Assistant
[United States District Atorney stated
kihat:Jt"wa8 up to the other side to
make the next move, and on their
action would hinge the. turn of affairs
'iD^the^sfe.AVtd whether or not the
Fairmont post''office' case would come
up and be completed at the present
?term of court,; the .United States at
torney was unable to give definite 1m
fonnation. It is well knoyn,.however,
that^it';was his original intention to
omplete the case at this term of
_ourt, which term he said he did not
expect would last more than 10 dayr>.
This .being the case It will require
ifapid 'action to get the Fairmont case
and the other cases on the docket out
5pf?the way on-schedule time.
At noon today it seemed certain that
ithe. Fairmont case would not berore
jie court until tomorrow at least.
Several prominent attorneys have
f|ween;; retained by those indicted,
ffcmfing those who have been retained
to work on the case are Messrs. Mere
dith, Brown, Blizzard, Showalter and
"Fleming, all of whom have been in
Parkersburg since the opening of the
^present term of court.
ii^'fhere will be no separate trials,
nil of those indicted by the graud Jury
being given trial at the same time.
. Those indicted yesterday were A.
. Howard Fleming, Wilbur H. Brand.
