SPECIAL CITY ELECTION
Will be Held on Friday, February II,
to Vote on New Franchise for
Leon Electric Light Company.
A special City election has been
called to be held on Friday, Febru
ary 11, 1916, for the purpose of vot
ing upon a new franchise for the
Leon Electric Co., the franchise as
asked for being published in full on
page nine of this issue. It provides
some radical changes in prices for
street lighting as well as the hours
during which the lights shall burn,
and is to run for a period of twen
ty-five years. The old franchise has
about seven years to run yet, but as
negotiations have been in progress
for some time looking towards the
.sale of the light and power plant to
Davenport parties, who did not
want to invest their money with only
a seven year franchise, it was de
cided to ask for a new franchise to
replace the old one with one which
would run for twenty-five years.
Every citizen in Leon is interested
in this matter. You should read the
franchise carefully and understand
what it provides, for it settles the
matter for the next quarter of a cen
tury and when you go to vote on it,
you should know what it provides
for.
Harry J. Vogt to Leave Leon.
Many friends will be mighty sorry
to learn that Mr. and Mrs. Harry J.
Vogt are soon to leave Leon to take
up their residence at Galesburg, Il
linois. Mr. Vogt for several years
lias been employed as traveling sales
man for the wholesale grocery house
-of J. H. Merrill & Co., of Ottumwa,
and has had southern Iowa and north
tern Missouri towns as his territory.
He has been very successful in this
work, so much so that when the firm
needed a new manager for their
wholesale house which is located at
Galesburg, they offered the position
to Mr. Vogt. He went over to Gales
burg last week and after looking
over the situation decided to accept
the position. He will remain here for
three weeks yet, going over his ter
ritory with the new salesman who
takes his place, and will take charge
of the Galesburg house the first of
February. The promotion is a dis
serving one and we are pleased to
see Mr. Vogt's ability recognized,
That he will make good in his posi
tion as manager goes without saying,
.-Md our only regret is that it will
.iafce Mr. and Mrs. Vogt away from
Leon where they have resided for so
many years,, for they are very popul
lar citizens of Leon, and will be sadly
missed when they leave.
Pensions Granted to Ten Blind Resi
dents of Decatur County.
At the meeting of the board of
supervisors last week, an annual pen
sion of (150 per year was granted to
ten blind resident of Decatur coun
ty, under the provisions of the new
law which went into effect recently.
Under the law they will receive a
warrant every three months for
$37.50, and it will be a great help
to many of them. Those who were
placed on the pension list were An
nie Bizler, Josephine Cozad, J. M.
Carrier, J. F. Fenton, H. H. Hatfield,
C. W. Riggs, Samuel J. Scott, John
Sanders, Mary Umphress and Eliza
beth Vanderpool. The application of
W. H. Young, the blind broom mak
er of Richland township, was reject
ed because of the fact, that his in
come exceeded 1300.00 per year, the
law making the provision that the
person receiving the pension shall
not have an income exceeding $300
per year.
Sudden Death of Mrs. J. H. Stanley.
When J. H. Stanley stepped off the
train Tuesday noon he was handed a
telegram from his son-in-law, Tom
West, at Coon Rapids, saying Mrs.
Stanley was dead. Mr. and Mrs.
Stanley had been visiting at Coon
-Rapids with their daughter, and Mr.
Stanley left that place Monday morn
ing at 9 o'clock, going to Des Moines
and Manila on business and did not
learn of his wife's death until he
reached Leon. When he left Coon
Rapids the previous day Mrs. Stanley
was in her usual good health. In
company with his daughter, Mrs.
Fred T. Smith, of Pleasanton, Mr.
Stanley departed Tuesday afternoon
for Coon Rapids. No particulars of
the death of Mrs. Stanley have been
received, aside from the telegram an
nouncing that she was dead.
We Got the Odd Fellows in Bad.
The Reporter was responsible for
getting a lot of the Odd Fellows of
Leon in pretty badly with their wives
last week. We stated that the Odd
Fellows and their wives enjoyed a
watch party at the Odd Fellow's hall
on New Year's eve, and when the
ladies read the item there was
trouble brewing when hubby came
home for she had not been invited
to the party and wanted to know if
her husband had taken some other
fellow's wife and left her at home,
when in fact It was a stag watch
party confined to the members of the
lodge, so the wives who were slight
ed by not being invited can rest easy.

WILL SOON HAVE TO HAVE AN
OTHER WELL
Increasing Consumption of City Wat
er is Getting Close to
the Limit.
When the deep well which supplies
Leon with city water was finished it
was thought it would supply an
ample supply of water for Leon for
a good many years to come, but who
ever dreamed that within so few
years there would be such an enor
mous increase in the amount of city
water used. During the year of 1915
the amount of water pumped each
month averaged 1,250,000 gallons a
month, as against 900,000 gallons a
month in 1914. In order to keep an
adequate supply of water in the
water tower it is now necessary to
run the pump about 15% hours per
day. There is an abundance of wat
er at the bottom of the deep well,
but the well is only six inches in
diameter at the bottom, and this will
not allow sufficient water to be pump
ed from the one well. We are right
up against the proposition of having
to put down another well, for with
several hundred parties making con
nections wnh the new water system
which has just been completed there
is going to be a big increase in the
amount of water used. There is no
use of putting the matter off until
we are out of water, but steps should
be taken at once by the city council
to provide a second well. It will take
several months to put down a well
after a contract is let, and the cold
facts are that if the coming summer
should happen to be a dry year the
present well cannot supply enough
water to meet the demands of the
consumers. This is a matter entitl
ed to and should receive proper con
sideration at the hands of the city
authorities. There is no time to
waste.
Re-Enacted the War Revenue Emer
gency Act.
Hundreds of inquiries received at
the office of the Collector of Inter
nal Revenue for Iowa indicate gener
al ignorance of the fact that congress
just before adjournment for the holi
day recess, re-enacted the War Rev
enue emergency act in its entirety,
for one year dating from Jan. 1,
1S1G. This is the law which requires
stamp taxes on deeds, notes, etc., and
on cosmetics and perfumes and im
poses special taxes on bankers, brok
ers, pawnbrokers, commercial brok
ers theatres, public exhibitions, pool
and billiard tables, bowling alleys,
commission merchants, tobacco deal
ers, .and .manufacturers of cigars and
tobacco. Unless the war taxes are
paid during January, double the
amount of tax will have to be paid
thereafter.
The returns of individuals and
corporations must be made before
March xst, to avoid heavy penalties.
For the fiscal year ended June 30,
IV15, Iowa corporations paid the
government ¥469,173 and individuals
subject to the tax, $264,315 as taxes
on their net incomes.
Leased New Albany Hotel.
G. B. Cooper and wife arrived last
Saturday from Excelsior Springs and
have taken charge of the New Al
bany Hotel, which he has leased of
Mrs. T. H. Hunt for a term of five
years. Mr. Cooper is an experienced
hotel man, having been for five years
in charge of the Chadwick and Sara
togo hotels at Excelsior Springs. Prior
to that time was also in the hotel
business at Leon and other points in
Iowa. All rooms at the New Albany
are being repapered and painted, new
rugs are being laid, the plumbing
work is being overhauled and when
this work is completed Landlord
Cooper expects to be able to offer to
the public accommodations equal to
the best to be found in northern Mis

Stout—Brown.
Mr. I. L. Stout, of Oakland, Cali
fornia, and Dr. Sarah Snavely Brown,
of Leon, were married at St. Joe,
Mo., last Wednesday. The groom is
an electrical engineer at Oakland,
California, and the parties had never
seen each other until they met at St.
Joe, having become acquainted
through relatives and friends and a
courtship by mail had been carried
on by them for several years.
Mr. and Mrs. Stout came to Leon
Thursday afternoon and are guests
at the home of her parents, Mr. and
Mrs. John Woodmansee. They will
visit relatives at Des Moines and oth
er places for a short time before re
turning to Oakland where they will
make their home.
"A Royal Slave."
The hearts of the feminine contin
gency of the audience at the presen
tation of "A Royal Slave," which
comes to the Leon opera house, on
Thursday, Jan. 13, will flutter when
the magnificent gowns worn by the
Countess Inez are seen in all their
gorgeousness.. She wears six alto
gether, a different gown in each act,
and two in the first act. It requires
a handsome woman who assumes the
role of the Countess, to display
these gowns to advantage. This is
hot a moving picture.

Live Stock.
Owing to the lateness of the season
the interest taken in the live stock
show held last Saturday at the close
of the short course was not up to the
standard of the last few years, neith
er in attendance or entries in the

ing a single entry. H. B. Hart assist
ed, by P. C. Tomlinson were in charge
of the live stock husbandry at the
short course and they Judged. tiro
classes.
The class for brood mares had six
entries there should have been twen
ty entries in this class. Where are
all of the gpod mares in Woodland

raising the prize winning colts ever
since the shows have been held and
why were they not brought forward.
We are satisfied that there is quite
a good many mares around Leon bet

TOOK TONS OF PAPER.
The Reporter for 1015 Consisted of
070 Pages, the Average Size of
the Paper Being 13 Pages.
Few people who have been read~
ing The Reporter during the year
just closed will realize the amount of
reading matter which they received
in the fifty-two issues of the paper*
there being a total of 676 pages in
that time which if bound into a book
would make a mighty big volume in
return for the $1.50 which the paper
cost them. Each page contains six
columns twenty inches long, so that
the total number of inches during the
year amounted to 81,120.
Only five times during 1915 did
The Reporter contain as few as ten
pages. During the year we issued
two papers of twenty-four pages
each, six of sixteen pages, seven of
fourteen pages, thirty-three of twelve
pages and live of ten pages, a total
of 676 pages, or an average of thir
teen pages for each week in the year,.
To print these fifty-two pages re
quired 50,193 pounds of print paper,
more than 25 tons, and all of this
paper had to be fed through the cyl
