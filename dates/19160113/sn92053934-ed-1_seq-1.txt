EXPORT OF GOLD
Meat Ainnu n f n f r
London, Jan. 13. The Daily News,
in a financial article today, expresses
the belief that export of gold to New
York will soon cease. I
"Although the present rate of ex
change is well below the normal ex
port point," says the Daily News,
"there can be little doubt that with
the abnormal freight and insurance
charges now ruling very little profit
attaches to such exports and as the
exch i.-o rate advances further no
profit a) all will be secured. This
should be a matter of great satisfac
tion throughout the country, but
should not check the efforts to curtail
imports as much as possible."
The article also refers to a rumor
a highly important development

FRIGID WEATHER
Chicago, 111., Jan. 13 The storm
which began yesterday over the mid
dle west continued today, snow, high
winds and low temperatures prevail
ing over Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kan

and Wisconsin. From the Canadian
northwest there also came reports of
unusually low temperatures. The
thermometer, at Prince Albert, Sask.,
went to 58 below.
According to meager reports Iowa,
the Dakotas and Minnesota were the
worst sufferers, on account of the
heavy snowfall and the low tempera

Railroad traffic west of Chicago has

twenty passenger trains are stalled,

SADAGURA IS
BELIEVED IN
RUSS HANDS
Although Fall of Town Lacks
Confirmation It Is Re
garded as Likely. V
IS STRATEGIC POINT
Natural Location and Facili
ties Make Possession of
It an Advantage.
Paris, Jan. 13, (5:35 a. m.) In
view of the success of the Austrian
offensive against Mount Lovcen,
measures have been taken by the
Montenegrin government to evacu
ate Cettinje immediately, accord
ing to a Scutari dispatch, says the
Petit Journal's Milan correspond
ent. A Scutari telegram to the Serbian
legation in Rome describes the situ
ation in Scutari as approaching des
peration. Food is lacking to feed
thousands of women, children and
refugees from Serbia, the latter, arriv
ing in large numbers, swelling the
refugee colony already established.
The new arrivals, adds the message.
are obliged to sleep in the open air in
the bitter cold. It declares that hun
dreds are dying daily in the streets ot
cold and hunger and that nearly all
the very young children have died
from lack of nourishment.
London, Jan. 13. The news from
the eastern front of the capture of
Sadagura is regarded in military cir- -cleras
probably true, although official
confirmation has not been forthcom
ing. The town, which lies a few miles
northeast of Czernowitz and is a con
verging point for five good roads, Is
of considerable strategic importance
and previous attempts to capture it
have been stoutly resisted. Experts
say Sadagura is of more importance
than Czernowitz, on account of its
stronger natural position and facili
ties for communication.
The report from Petrograd that the
offensive in Algeria and Bessarabia
has been suspended for the present is
regarded as premature. The Russian
offensive could not, it is believed, be
suspended suddenly, as it was launch
ed with unexpected strength. The ob
ject of that offensive is said to be
three-fold: To demonstrate to the Ru
manians that the Russian forces are
able to assume the initiative when
they choose; secondly, to divert Aus-tro-German
forces from the Balkans
and western front, and finally, to, im
prove the general strategic position
of their own left flank.
Effect Undetermined.
While the full effect of this Russian
offensive cannot yet be determined,
entente military experts affirm tiiat
the second object was attained, that
the situation in the Balkans was sen
sibly relieved, and that the operation
undertaken by the Germans against
the French in the Champagne was
robbed of its force.
The fact that the French flag Is now
waving over the palace on the island
of Corfu, which belonged to the Ger
man emperor, and that the occupation
of the Greek island by the entente Is
considered as complete has, it is re
ported, already evoked a protest from
the Greek government.
In Sympathy With Allies.
It is said that, the protest is largely
formal and that the allies have given
Greece guarantees regarding their in
tentions. Greece, it is understood,
j takes a svmDathetic view of the en
; nite military purpose. The failure is
declared to have been complete and
j the German forces suffered terrible
j looses.

veloping their campaign in Montcne-
falVoaf ce'umje, the capital of Monte-
: negro, is possible in the near future.
