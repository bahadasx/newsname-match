and clothes the forests in early
verdure. This pleasant spring
weather is terminated by a few
day's ram,1 and the clearing up is
followed up by cold, raking winds
jrpri the.nprthwest, leaving the
j atnvwphere of a pure indigo tint,
through.which wink bright stars,
tbut if the wind subsides at night,
' the succeeding morning shows a
.heavy hore frost vegetation is
-utterly killed, including all man-
neFoffrpit germs, and the land
scape clothed in verdure the day
before now looks dark and drea
ry
It is precisely under this condi
tion of things that the beautiful
phenomenon of the "Verdant
Zone" or "Thermal Belt" exhib
its itself, upon pur. mountain
(Sides, commencing about three
hundred feet vertical height above
the valleys, and traversing them
in "a perfectly horizontal line
throughout their-entire length
like a vast green ribbon upon
ft black ground. " Its breadth is
.lur .hundred feet vertical height,
. and iraj that wider, according
t the degree of the angle of the
'mountain with the plane of the
orfcon.f Vegetation of all kinds
within the limits of this zone is
untouched by frost; and such is

Isabella,' , the most tender of all
' our native grapes, has not failed
to ' produce abundant crops in
twenty-six consecutive years; nor
has fruit of , any kind ever been
" known within these limits to be
frosf killed, 'though there have
beeniinstances where it has been
sc) from a severe freeze. '
heJThermal belt must exist in
all countries that are traversed
,bj high mountains and deep val
(leys as the natural causes that
; produce it are as infalllible as
those which produce the rainbow
in the clouds; and the only rea
sofc.Why its visible manifesta
tions are peculiar to our South'
era Alleghanies is the fact that
their precocious spring vegeta-
tion is sometimes killed by frost,
Vwhtle the same thing does not
.happen in the mountains further
north.
The philosophy of the subject,
which I claim, to have . discover
ed and published the 28tb of Ap
ril, 1858, is the following: '
,r-. Frost is but crystalized dew,
; and can only form during clear,
till nights, when the atmosphere
Is in perfect repose. The atmos
phere, when at rest, .falls into
series of strata, one lying above
, the other, the heaviest stratum
' becoming the base of those a
boye it, .and all take positions
"according to their weignt ana
density, upon the principle of
gravitation.
. Heat is the agent that produ
ces this result . This heat is of
two kinds, both from the same
, source; the primary one being the
suns rays direct, and the oilier
the beat reserved or retained by
the earth. This heat is ever ra-
diatinsr. and in cold, clear, still
nights it mounts up wary through
the cold, damp air, taking from
it- Its caloric,, while i the latter
!
rushes down in a cold frost,' pro
ducing currents, and hence the
lowest ground in a valley is ever
'. subject to the hardest frosts. The
ifann, dry, light current keeps
. mounting upward like cork in
.X.ater, until it reaches a stratum
Of atmosphere too thin and light
'".-to' sutobrt it woea it consequent
fli It ti eMXsras Ii warm,
of the lower or frost stratum;
and hence in cold, frosty nights
is propuced the phenomonen of
the "Vernal Zone." ' ; :
It is a fact that can be well at
tested, that all attempts to cul
tivate the grape in our low damp
valleys have utterly failed, the
fruit being attacked before fully
grown by what is called mildew
blight, while the few Vines grow
ing upon the small farms . lying
high upon the mountain sides
have ever matured their fniit in
the greatest perfection; and the
true reason of this is, that all
good vaiieties of grapes have
thin skins, are ol tender organi
zation, and easily affected by a
damp atmosphere and chill dew.
And on the mountain, being with
in a comparatively dry thermal
zone, tbey grow in an atmos
phere peculiarly adapted to the
delicacy of their tender organiza
tion. In view of these facts; I
say confidently that any well
conducted effort at grape culture
will succeed, whether it be upon
the sunny slopes of our southern
Alleghanies or upon the 'moun
tain sides that skirt the beatiful
valleys of the northern states,
and all that is required to insure
success is to. ascertain where this
"Thermal Belt" is and to plant
the vines within its limits.,
It is proper, however, to re
mark that this belt varies in the
height of its range above differ
ent valleys according to the phys
ical construction of the country
I will name a case in point, i I
made my observation in relation
to thin belt in Macon county, N.
C, which traversed a beautiful
valley of the Little Tennessee riv-
er, lying two tnousana ieet a-
bove tide water. Here, when the
thermometer i down to twenty-
six degrees, the frost, the frost
reaches three hundred feet verti
cal height A small river, having
its source in a high plateau nine
teen hundred feet above this runs
down into tuia valley, breaking
through three mountain barri-
ers, and consequently maicing
three short valleys, including the
plateau, one rising above the
other, each of which has its ver
nal zone traversing the hillsides
that enclose them, the the first of
which takes a much lower range
than that of the lower valley,
aud each taking a lower as t h e
valleys mount higher in the at-
uiocphere, and in the highest one
the range of the belt is not more
than one hundred feet above the
common level of the platteau, a
beautiful level height containing
six thousand acres of land, and
lying three thousand nine hun
dred feet above side water. Re

For the first time in the histo
ry of this state, or of any other
state, so far as The Citizen can
earn, convicts pcrving sentence
on the roads for various terms,
were enabled to return, to their
homes for Christmas when Gov-
ernor Craig urged the commis-
sianers pf various counties, to
take such action. Some persons
there were who were inclined to
doubt the wisdom of the govern;
pr's action, but generally it was
felt that the experiment was well
worth trying, and that no harm
could come of it What happen
ed? From all reports to date not
a single convict betrayed the
trust reposed in him; not one
man bo paroled has yet been re
ported as missing. We quote
rom a recent dispatch from Ral-
igh: , .;
. "Complete reports from the
state camps, ten in number, gave
Governor Craig at the close of
the old year the cheering ! news
that not one of the many prison
ers paroled broke the trust with
him. The men returned punctual-
too. Perhaps no act of a
North Carolina governor in a
double decade , has , caused so
much comment from afar." -
Governor Craig may well feel
intensely gratified at the success
of a plan which was prompted by
the highest motives of humani
ty, and North Carolina generally
will rejoice with him that a step
so advanced along the line of re-
'orm. .movements should have
met with no mishap. The Citizen
approved the suggestion when it
was made because it felt that no
danger, but much good would
come of it. This paper, was in
clined to the opinion that the
governor had studied the ques
tion from every angle, and had
not acted on impulse,' however
creditable, when he advised the
county boards to parole hun
dreds of convicts for the Christ
mas season, r l r 1 1
Tiie Citizen congratulates the
governor on the success ol nis
movement, and also the coutaty
commissioners who had the good
sense and. sound judgement to
act in'accord therewith.
This generation may yet see
the dawn of a day when the prob-
em of prison reform can be solved
by the, application of methods
more humane than those we now
employ. In that day men who
have the misfortune to ran foul
of the law may come to know
that their future is not devoid of
hope, and that punishment for
crime calls for no display of bru
tanty. men, too, ne may see
the administrative authorities
not in the role af merciless aven
gers, but as corrective agencies
whose discharge of executive du
ties is tempered with intelligence
and reason. Governor Craig has
demonstrated that such methods
can be successfully app'ied in deal
ing with the criminal classes.

Christmas has come and gone;
the "boys" are still in the tren
ches and Henry Ford is back in
the United States minus his halo
and considerable cash. The mon
ey loss of course, will not bother
a man who admits that, he has
more than he knows what to do
with, but one reflects on the bet
teruses to which the vast sums
spent by Ford could have been
put, he can but regret that com
mon sense was swept away by
mpulse.
Doomed to failure at the start
by very reason of its nature, the
ord peace mission will long re
main the target for the shafts of
okemongers. Ford himself has
already lost much of that esteem
and respect wherein he was held
when he applied rare generosity
to the solution of the labor prob-
lem. But when he left his chosen
field to wander at random in the
realm of fancy he fell considera
bly In public favor. Perhaps Mr.
Ford meant well; it is not for us
to divine his motives, but he at
tempted much without giving
the subject that thought and
study which a project so vast in
scope required. "The failure of
Henry Ford's project," says The
Editorial, "for peace among the
warring European nations will
be ascribed by many to the fact
he had no definite plan; that he
rushed in where it might be
thought angels feared to tread,
without any clear idea of what
he was going to do or how he
was going to do it The time for
ears and misgivings is before
starting in. After you have made
the plunge there should be no ex
cuse for turning back, unless in
surmountable obstacles are en
countered which could not be
breseen at the start"
Incidentally one wonders why
the standards of efficiency which
Mr. Ford is said to have applied
to his automobile industry did
not prompt him to prepare in
some measure for his peace mis
sion. Even when the peace ship
touched the other side, Ford and
his guests seem to have landed
without an idea Of the next meth
od of procedure. , .
A Lonetf
As kings go, Petor of Serbia, is
the loneliest figure in the world
today. He is a king with only the
memory of a country.
His final farewell to the rem
nont of his soldiers was as noble
as it was pathetic, lie released
them from allegienco to their
king, but commended their coun
try to their present and future
hope.
His children had long left him,
and he was, in that seuse, alone
when the invader came and wres
ted his country from him.
His few remaining years will be
dark with bitter memories. It is
the fate and ill fortune of a war
he did hot seek; and there is the
grief of his homeless people to
make his exile darker.
One thing of sustaining strength
in his favor is that, as king, he
felt for and with his people and,
perhaps, returns , some measure
of their affection.
But the shadow which has fall
en on bira is feared by other
kings, now more fortunate, in
that they still keep their crowns.
It is the shadow of a great fear
for the outcome of a war that is
teaching stem lessons to thepeo
ple'who, coming to know things
better, will no longer stand in
awe of thrones erected over hu
man rights. Kings, too, will
learn their lesson. Atlanta Cpn-

Whit of til Night?
Charity and Children,
The year 1910 is to be one of
tremendous events. It is the ear
nest prayer of all good men that
the fool war in Europe will come
to a close. There are some favor
able indications, While Germany
thus far has done the finest fight
ing, she cannnot forever hold
out against the world. It is hop
ed that before it is everlastingly
too late for her she will sue for
peace She is in a better posi
tion now to secure favorable
terms than she will be a year
lence. But her disappointment is
so bitter and her organization so
superb that she finds is hard to
surrender the superstition that
she was divinely called to rule
the world. Let us hope that the
ight will finally break upon her
that Bhe is engaged in a hopeless
struggle and the sooner she sur
renders the better for her and for
all mankind. On the other hand
Great Britain has bungled from
the beginning. The war spirit is
said to be weaker in England
than in any other warring na
tion. Lloyd George has been im
ploring the young men of Brit
ain to rally to the defense of the
country with passionate elo
quence, but so far his pleading
seems to be in vain. The English
army is poorly officered. There is
strife and confusion in the cabi
net, and where there should be
harmony and unity among the
leaders there is discord and dis
sension. If Germany had hadEng
land's opportunity she would
long ago have swept her enemies
off the earth. France has done
her part nobly in the struggle,
and poor old Russia has made
the greatest sacrifice of all. But
in the final outcome Russia will
be in position to demand her full
share of the booty, and it is for
this that she is giving so much of
her life blood. What or when the
end shall be no man can tell.
Peace may break upon the world
in a day, or the sickening strug
gle may go on through weary
months. Let us all hope that the
next Christmas may find the
oloody orgie ended, and the
world at peace.

Jess Willard is a cautious lad,
according to the late reports; he
looks with reverence on the scad,
unlike the old-time spendthrift
sports. He takes the nickles to
the bank as fast as he can draw
them in, and dream all night a
bout the clank of shining little
heaps of tin. To Jess an ordi
nary plunk looks bigger than a
ballroom floor; all other themes
than cash are bunk he won't
discuss them any more. Some
day a better pug will rise, and
punch the rafters from his dome,
and spoil his nose, and close hid
eyes, and send him in a basket
home. And when he s in the has
been class, he will not haunt the
free lunch track; ah, no, he'll
have his store of brass, the wolf
will not come near his shack
The dead game sports look on
with sneers, when Jess declines
to blow his roll, for stacks' of
chiDB and long cold beers, and
things that put one in the hole,
The prize ring heroes of the post
