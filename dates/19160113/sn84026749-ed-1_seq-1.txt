AT W YARD
Rear Admiral Stanford Tells
House Committee That
Present Shop Js Totally In
adequate For Needs.
"Need For- Addition Pressing."
Oil Storage Facilities Also
Should Be Enlarged Wants
$65,000 For Model Storage.
An appropriation of $600,000
for improvements and additions at
the gun shop of the Washington
navy yard was advocated before
the House Committee on Naval
Affairs today ty Rear Admiral H.
R. Stanford, chief of the Bureau
of Yards and Docks, when the
committee continued its national
defense hearings on the naval ap
propriation bill.
That the present gun shop at the
Washington yard is "totally in
adequate,'' was asserted by
Admiral Stanford.
Admiral Stanford said the de
partment .proposed the erection o
a steel frame building, with brick
wals,- or concrete and brick walls,
at the Wa5hingtoivyard.It is csti
matid that it would "take from
eighteen months to two years -to
build the addition, and, mean
while, the yard cannot do the work
it should be turning outy,
NEED IS PRESSING.
Congressman Buchanan asked If the
(Un shop Is being used to its full
capacity.
"I can only answer that," said Ad
miral Stanford, "by saying: that those
In command of the yard declare the
Run shop Is totally Inadequate and
the need for an addition Is pressing."
Admiral Stanford said the proposed
extension would be about 600 by 200
feet and built In the shape of an L,
which -will take In several old build
tags. Congressman Butler observed, with
noma show of Impatience, that the
Naval Affairs Committee appears to
build up one year and tear down the
next year. He asked If the oJLfl build
ings at the Washington yard could be
utilised in constructing the new ad
dition. "I would use the Judgment of those
in command of the yard," said Ad
mlr Stanford.
For Oil Storage.
Admiral Stanford also explained the
&eed for a $65,000 plant for the stor-'sev.
j age of models used for experimental
purposes. For fuel oil storage, the
sum of li,00 was asked. Admiral
Stanford asserting that at present tho
oil supply at the yard Is stored in old
boilers and the supply on hand is
always limited. This oil, he said, is
used in heatlnrr some of tho gun pita
and a larger supply should be on
hand for emergency purposes.
Congressman Callaway developed
that big guns for th rfroadnaughts
are constructed at the Washington
yard, and the proposed extensions
have a beating on the defense prob
lem for this reason.
DIscusMon of the neids of other
rards at.d dorks followed Admiral
Ktnnford's explanation of the esti
mates for the Washington vard.

"I brought In Brown that night, Sep

MURDER OF KRAMER IS CONFIRMED
Carranza Assures United States That Bandits
Who Killed Americans Will Be Run
Down and Punished By
His Troops
Confirmation of the murder of another American citi
zen, Bert Kramer, assurances from Carranza that the slay
ers of eighteen Americans would be run down and punish
ed, and the introduction in the Senate by one of the Demo
craticleaders of a resolution authorizing the President to
use United States armed forces in Mexico are the outstand
ing features in the startling developments in the Mexican
situation today.
Further details reaching the State Department todav
of the massacre of the eighteen Americans add to, rather
than lessen, the seriousness of the situation.
Press reports from the border bring unconfirmed re
ports of another wholesale killing and wild excitement
Lreigns at El Paso where the
arrived today.
Numerous arrests of Mexicans there were made to
avoid trouble and the regulars are taking every precau
tion to avoid a clash across the border line.
SENATOR LEWIS' RESOLUTION.
Further evidence that Congress is not disposed to sit
quiet while American citizens are murdered by Mexican
bandits was given in the Senate today when Senator James
Hamilton Lewis of Illinois, one of the prominent Demo
cratic leaders, introduced a resolution which would author
ize the President to use the army and the naval forces to
secure American life and property in the Mexican republic.
The resolution was deemed the more significant be
cause it came from the Democratic side. Hitherto it has
been represented that Republicans alone, for political rea
sons, vwere insisting upon intervention by force of arms.
Senator Lewis asked that the resolution lie on the table and
he will discuss it later.
The introduction of the measure was but one of the
evidences that the feeling at the Capitol over Mexico is
heavily surcharged.
Senator Lewis' resolution is brief and to the point.
It provides that the President of the United States shall be
authorized to order the army or any necessary part of it to
Mexico to co-operate with any force existing there to pro
tect the citizens and property of the United States and to
punish those violating thd security of United States citi
zens; and further that authority be given to use the military
and naval forces of the United States in Mexico to the same
extent as now by law permitted in Nicaragua and Haiti for
the protection of American rights.
GIVES WIDEST POWERS.
On the face of things this seems to give authority to
the President to use force only to protect American citizens,
but as an actual fact the naval forces, specifically the Ma
rine Corps, have been in virtual possession of Haiti for
months and may remain there indefinitely. That the adop
tion of the. Lewis resolution will give the President au
thority to intervene in the broadest fashion was scarcely
doubted by $enators who gave it attention.
KRAMER'S DEATH CONFIRMED.
While the Administration pondered
today the question as to whether, aft
er all. Carranza is able to control the
situation In Mexico to the extent of
guaranteeing protection to foreign
ers, confirmation reached the State
Department of the murder of another
American citizen.

man, Uvlnp at Gulerra, sixty mllea
