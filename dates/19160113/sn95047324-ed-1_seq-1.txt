Announcement Made Relative to
Products for Exhibition
Tampa Directors of the South
Florida Fair, the dates of which
.are February 4 to 12, announce
that they will be ready to receive
products for exhibition ten days
before the opening date, and all
products will be given the best'
possible care. The exhibition
buildings will be completed dur
ing the coming week. They are
the most attractive ever erected
for the use of a Florida fair.
Hundreds of premium lists and
thousands of advertising folders
are now beuig distributed
throughout Florida and other
states. Those desiring premium
lists can secure them from their
postmasters, boards of trade, or
express agents, or by writing to

the visitors will include hundreds
of homeseekers. Directors of the

AN EGREGIOUS BLUNDER'
Made by the State Executive Committee May Cut the Dem
ocratic Vote Down to Thirty - Five
Thousand
, Editor The Herald: I have
been requested by one of the pa
pers of the state toexpress my o
pinion in relation to the resolu
tion adopted January 6th, 1916,
by the State Democratic Execu
tive Committee, regulating the
qualifications of voters in the
Democratic Primary.
Prior to the enactment of the
Bryan Primary Law in 1913,tbere
was held in this State practically
a White, called Democratic, Pri
mary, at winch every White
Qualified Elector in Florida could
vote, the understanding being
that the voter would not vote a
gainst the State and County tick
et thus nominated. This was ta
ken to include all the Candidates
except those for President and
Vice-President. In other words,
the Republicans, Socialistsv and
others, could vote in such Pri
mary without forfeiting their
right to vote for the President of
their choice. In this way many
Republicans and others, having
voted in the Primary, at first
swallowed the State and County
ticket, and afterwards swallowed
the entire ticket, becoming good
Democrats.
This, in my fJgment( is the
only way in which we can have
one White Party in Florida. If
we were to have two White Par
ties, neither being a negligible
factor, one would call upon the
Negro for assistance, compelling
the other to do the same. Ther
fore, instead of having two White
Parties, with the Negro to settle
their differences, I have always
favored and I favor now, one
White Party in which every White
qualified Elector may vote, the re
striction being that he will not

make a complete ana creunaoie
improvement; to advise as to ma
terial to be used, and as experts
in road construction to make all
proper tests of material before
and during construction ; to sup
erintend the construction of said
work, keeping a rtsident engineer
on the ground whenever neces
sary, and visiting the work as of
ten as may be necessary to secure
first class work and to see ' that
plans and specifications are fully
complied with. Provided, that if,
at any time, any person employed
in connection tvith the said work,
by said engineering company
shall be unsatisfactory to the
county commissioners, such per
son shall be discharged and re
placed by a person satisfactory to
the county.
As compensation for such serv
ices said company shall be paid 2
per cent. of the estimated cost of
the work as soon as a satisfactory
contract shall be let for the work,
or if it. be decided to have work
done otherwise than bv contract,

then said 2 per cent, shall be paid
as soon as a satisfactory plant for
doing said work can be installed

I One and a half per cent, of said

company shall be paid a sum
which when added to all former
payments shall make a sum equal
to 5 per cent, of the actual cost of
the work.
Provided, further, that if it
shall be found that the cost of a
modified sheet asphalt pavement
on four inch base of rock and
marl shall txceed $18,000, the
work may be discontinued under
the said specifications at the op
tion of the county, and the 2 per
cent, payment above provided for
shall be in full for the services of
said engineering company.
Road petition was received
from J. II. Brown and others ask
nig for a road in the Zolfo dis
trict." -
Sheriff filed his report.
Following resolution was made
and unanimously carried:
Whereas, The statutes of the
State of Florida do not fix the
date for the meeting of the Board
of County Commissioners of the
various counties of the state ex
cept the dates for equalization of
vote against any of the direct
nominees of the Primary, it being
well known that the President is
not a direct nominee. I there
fore do not favor the Resolution
recently adopted by the State
Democratic Executive Committee.
Th"e. Bryan .Primary law permits
only Democrats to vote . in the
Democratic Primary, thus chang
ing the nature of the former
White Priary to a Democratic
Primary, debarring Socialists,
Republicans and others, from
having any choice in the selection
of the State and County officers.
I am not a member of the Or
ganization referred to in the Res
olution. I have no idea as to its
membership. I have no way of
determining how many voters,
Catholic or. Protestant, would be
prevented from voting in the Pri
mary, who are now J' influenced
in. voting for or against any Can
didate by any religious test or on
account of religious belief.denom
ination or sect with which the
Candidate js .affiiliated." If en
forced, it may diminish the
55,000 or 60,000 who now vote n
the Democratic Primary to 35,000
or 40,000, thus inviting opposition
to the ticket.
The members of the committee
who shot off this shot, undoubted
ly thought they did it for th? ben
efit of the Democratic partx. The
shot is so loaded and aimed, how
ever, as to benefit a certain candi
date or candidates and to injure
a certain candidate or candidates,
1 have seen it stated that there
are between 5,000,000 and 6,006,-
000 voters, members of such or
ganization in the United States.
To this, add those who will be
"influenced in voting for or a-
'taxes and for hearing complaints
of those fleeted ly such equali
zation ; ana, .
Whereas, It is a very difficult
matter for the various bills incur
red to reach the proper officials
to be audited and paid by the
Board of County Commissioners
by the first Monday in each
month, which date has been the
customary meeting date for the
past many years; and,
WThereas, Under the present ar
rangement it is necessary for the
members of the Board of County
Commissioners to audit and write
.1 111 i 1 1
up eacn oin, xnereny making a
great deal of clerical work for the
hoard, which consumes a great
portion of the time of said board
which really distracts their minds
from the more important matters
11 1 111 n m
wincn snoiuci nave caretul con
sideration ; and,
Whereas, If the county cleik
had alLthe lulls in hand for some
days"""Sefore the meeting of said
board he could have bills audited
and warrants drawn and it would
only require a short time for the
board to check up the work of
said clerk and stamp their appro
val or rejection on same, and the
cnairman sign all warrants, and
thereby facilitate the work and
save time and money; therefore,
Be it Resolved, That the date of
the regular meeting of DeSoto
county be and the same is hereby
changed from the first Monday in
each month to the first Wednes
day in each month, after the first
Monday, except when the law re
quires the board to meet on the
first Monday;
That all bills incurred for the
previous month be required to be
O. K.'d by the county commis
sioner from whose district same
originates, or by the sheriff, clerk,
or whosoever duty it might be to
pass upon same;
That said clerk be required to
audit said bill as to correctness of
figures, etc., and to arrange in
proper form for filmg and draw
warrant for same and have bill
ready for the approval of the
board and the warrant ready for
the signature of the chairman;
That the clerk have prepared
at each board meeting a list of all
bills audited of the various funds,
and each commissioner be furn
ished a copy of said list;
That the bond trustees of the
special road and drainage dis-
gainst any Candidate by any re
ligious test or on account of re
ligious belief, denomination, or
sect with which the Candidate is
affiliated." If all such, voters
were debarred from the Democra
tic Party the Democrats could
not possibly elect the next Presi
dent. Why force such voters out
of the Democratic Party? 1 do
not favor the Resolution.
It is a well known fact that
the Anti-Saloon League will fav
or a Candidate for the Senate
who will vote for National Pro
hibition, well knowing that, in
case the state should go against
Prohibition, such Senator would
be voting against the expressed
wishes of the majority of the e
lectors, because, if National Pro
hibition succeeds, it would force
Statewide Prohibition on the
people of Florida through the
votes of other States and against
the wishes of the people of Flori
da. Suppose the members of the
Anti-Saloon League had been de
barred. They make the princi
pal plank of the Prohibition Par
ty, . the predominant "test" of
"voting for or against" a candi
date in the Democratic Primary.
This with the others, would have
debarred most of the voters of
the Democratic Party, rendering
the Democratic Party a negligi
ble factor, practically "busting"
it.
There should be no restrictions
placed upon a White Voter, vot
ing in the Democratic Party, oth
er than he will not vote against
any of the State, Cogressional
and County nominees of the Pri
mary. That is the best way in
which to build up the Party; the
other is the best way in which to
tear down the Party,
the Party.
I can well believe that there are
some church people. Catholic and
11 A. . i i - i ' 1 .
rroiesiani, oi pronounced senu
nients or prejudices, who are "in
fluenced in voting for or against
any candidate by any (some) re
ligious test or on account of rcli
gious belief, denomination or sect
with which the Candidate is affih
ated. This is the hrst time in
the history of the State in which
a religious test has ever been ap
plied to a voter. It is against the
spirit of the Constitution. It is a
sacrifice, not upon the altar, but,
deep down into the hell-hole of
political partisanship, ot the reli
gious sentiments and prejudices
of some of the best people of ,the
state.
Whose fine steel-pointed dag
ger is behind that Resolution I do
not know. I am satisfied that the
members of the Executive Com
mittee considered that they were
actinsr for the best interests of
th Party.
Very truly yours,

Candidate for U. S. Senator
tricts be requested to furnish the
board with as many as five copies
of all bills to be paid.
On petition of Geo. W. Gate
wood and others, two public
roads were granted in the Ber
mont section.
The Board entered into execu
tive session to consider the matter
of selecting an official newspaper

proposition upon which the pa
pers be requested to submit seal-
d bids at the next regular meet

road and bridge district in the
Charlotte Harbor territory and
ordering an election for bonds to
be held in said territory on Jan.

THE BESSARABIAN
FRONT SCENE OF
BLOODY FIGHTING
Two Hundred Thousand Loss on
Both. Sides
THE RUSSIANS TRIUMPH
On this Western Front Germans
Appear to Have Made Gains
Reduce French Trenches in
Champagne Sector
London, England The fighting
on the Bessarabian -front has
been perhaps the bloodiest of tho
entire war on any front. It is es
timated at Vienna, reports from
there state, that nearly 200,000
men were lost by the Russians
and the Teutons in" the battling
around Czernowitz the past ten
days.
Apparently there is a lull there
now, wijh the Russians holding
the ground they gained at heavy
cost, and the Austrians and Ger
mans trying to repair the gaps in
their broken front. The Russians
dominate Czernowitz, but there
seems'to be no truth in the earlier,
reports that they had taken the.
town. The Austrians have evac
uated at least a portion of the city
but they have not entirely with
drawn. Military authorities here
are of the opinion that their po
sitions in the immediate vicinity
of Czernowitz are untenable and
that further gains by the Rus
sians may be announced shortly.
Tho Russians have oKgrcat a
mount of artillery now, with ap
parently an abundance of high
class munitions,' and their heavy
fire has been causing tremendous
losses m the Austrians ranks.
On the western front the Ger
mans appear to have gained some
ground that they lost to tho
French some time ago in the
Champagne sector. The. French
war office, while admitting that
the new German offensive was
successful at first, claims most of
the ground was retaken. The at
tack of infantry was preceded by
a withering artillery nre wnicn
crumpled up the French trenches
in the stylo that has preceded al
most every attempt to take
trenches on that front.
The Montenegrin war office
statement admits defeat by the
Austrians at several points, but
claims the Montenegrins inflicted
severe losses on their enemies and
gave ground only under sheer '
press of numbers. The morale of
the Montenegrin army is splen
did.
A statement from Berlin is to ,
the effect that the submarine
which sank the Italian liner Porto
Said in the Mediterranean last
month, causing loss of lives of
six passengers, was an Austrian.
PETITIONS FOR PARDON
Weakness of Human Nature
in
Sngning them
Sometimes when we consider
the weakness of human nature in
signing petitions at the solicita
tion of friends, especially when
the pardon of some, criminal is
sought, and rcliect how almost
yards of names are attached to
such petitions, in which each sig
nature represents .neither sinceri
ty nor honest conviction of the
truth of the statements made in
the petition, we almost wish that
the board of pardons would shovo
all such documents in tho wasto
basket and give them no weight
in deciding upon the application.
As a rule, they represent merely
the ignorance and indifference or
the moral cowardice of the signer,
who, rather than offend a friend
asking his signature, would givo
the weight of his influence as a
citizen to the work of destroying
tho efficiency of the courts by
turning some criminal loose, on
society. The board of pardons
probably wouldn't go wrong if
petitions, barring exceptional
cases, were treated as newspaper
men deal with the great quanti
ties of free advertising literature
that reach their desks and were
promptly swept to tho discard.
