H A KMC.
This brief wire from H. J. Sim
mons, Dauphin contractor, to his
brother-in-law, F. C. Gerlierich, chief
of the State Bureau of Railways, this
morhing, allayed the fears of his rel
atives that he was shot with the party
of Aemrican mining men in Mexico
by Villa bandits, Monday afternoon.
Until this word was received it was
believed that he was with the party,
as it was known he had heavy inter
ests in Mexico.
1 Fears of his death were further sub
stantiated by the appearance of the
name of "R. H. Simmons" in the list
of dead as related exclusively in the
Telegraph last night.
H. J. Simmons' narrow escape
from death at the hands of the Mexi
can murderers is described in the la
conic sentence, "Missed party to
Cusl." It was believed by Mr. Ger
berlch that Simmons would grasp the
first opportunity to go into Mexico to
see bow his contracting equipment
and supplies at the mines of the Am
erican Smelting company had fared
during the revolution so that when
news of the massacre reached here
he abandoned hope.
C. R. Watson, whose bride of a few
months, distracted with grief, is at
the home of Mr. and Mrs. H. J. Sim
mons in El Paso, was a business as
sociate of Mr. Simmons, who undoubt
edly would have shared Watson's
fate had he not missed the train.

was made the chief target of the ban
dits when the train was stopped, and

Philadelphia. Pn., Jan. IS. The

vanla for more than half a century,
as well as similar forms of class
rivalry, will probably be abolished as
the result of yesterday's battle be

Resolutions favoring such action

while The Pennsylvanian, the daily
publication of the students In an

Russians Are Attaining Their
Objects; French Occupy

By Associated Press
l,ondon, Jan. 13. The news from
the eastern front of tlie capture ot
I Sadagura Is regarded in military cir
cles as probably true, although offi
cial announcement of the subject has
not been received. The town, which
lies a few miles northeast of Czerno
witz and is a converging point for
| five railroads, has considerable
strategic importance and previous at
tempts to capture it have been stout
ly resisted. Experts say Sadagura is
really of more importance than
O.ernowitz, on account of its stronger
natural position and facilities.
The report from Petrograd that tho
offensive in Galieia and Bessarabia
bad been suspended for the present
is reprarded as at least premature. Tho
Russian offensive could not, it is be
lieved, he suspended suddenly, as tt
was undertaken after careful prep
aration and launched with unexpected
strength. The object of that offen

demonstrate to the Rumanian that
the Russian forces are able ro assume
the initiative when they chose; sec
ondly, to divert Auatro-Ocrman force
from tho Balkans and finally 1o im
prove the general strategic position ut
their own left flank.
While the full effect of this Rus
sian offensive cannot yet be deter

that the second object, was attained,
that the situation in the Balkans was
