Emily Burger Admits She Is
"Other Woman" in Mohr Case
Former Housekeeper for Murdered Physician Teli.s Court of
the Part She Plaved' in the Double Life of the Victim.
Confronted with Hotel Registers Bearing Her Name.
B> VM'IIIK IHKIDWKI.I?. i
Providence, Jan. 12.?When Emily I
Burger, the woman about whom the
whole tragedy of the Mohr murder
case whirls, took the stand and began ;
to answer the questions of Attorney j
(renerai Rice, and her ?oft and pleas
ing voice sounded in the air, I could ,
think of no parallel save that given j
when Evelyn Nesblt Thaw thrilled and j
shocked all who heard her and read1
her testimony.
Miss Burger is the "other woman" in
the Mohr case and she had to admit '
it today on the stand. As long as it ?
was in her power to do so, she protect
ed herself. She was cornered finally !
with a list of the hotels which she had ?
visited with Dr. Mohr as her compati- j
ion?the man whose widow Is on trial
for his murder.
In going to the witness stand, she
passed within an inch of Mrs. Mohr.
Mrs. Mohr's eyes ehot out hate, and
her white face became the white of
ashes.
There was nothing new brought out
in the direct examination and It waa
not until Arthur (?. ('ushing took her
in hand for cross examination that
Miss Burger realized what a tremen
dous thing she had ?worn to do?to
tell the truth. ?
Mr. Cushtng picked up a sheet of,
paper from the table before her and ,
resd from it a list of the hotels where
?he had registered with Dr. Mohr. Un
til that time there had been no vug- '
gestion that the ?tory of Dr. Mohr ? ;
double life would be brought from the
lips of Kinily Burger. During the di- j
rect examination Mies Burger had tes
tified that she was employed by Dr.'
Mohr as a housekeeper In his splendid
Newport residence. She also testified
that Dr. Mohr had been a good friend
to her.
It was not until Mr. Cuahing held
before him that sheet of paper that
any on? In the court room understood
that the big test was to be demanded !
of this low voiced woman. It came so
?suddenly that it stunned every one. .
Under her fur-trimmed cloak you could
see her breast rise and fall. But she
did not fslnt. "She asked that the list
of the hotels be read sgaln. Her re-j
ply was singularly frank. She said: |
"I was with Dr. Mohr at a number of
these hotels but not at all of them."

At the point where the massa-re took j

Newman and I were sitting together, and !
Kvans came up and looked out of our I
window Kvans, Newman, Ma-? Hatten ?
and I then got off the train. Watson
was either getting off or about to do so. ?
behind us, when I looked back and saw
him.
Just after alighting. I heard a volley
of rifle shots from a point on the other
sii?? of the cut. and Just above the train.
Looking around. 1 could see a bunch of
about twelve or fifteen men standing in
a ?solid Une. shoulder to shoulder, shoot
ing directly at ua. They were fifty or I
?event> -five A**et away.
Watson, after getting off, ran toward I
the fiver. MacHatton and I followed.
Mediation fell. I don't know whether :
he was killed then or tripped. Watson
kept on running and they were still
shooting at him when I turned and ran
down grade, where I fell In tome brush
about loo feet from the rear of the train.
I lay there perfectly quiet and looked
around and could see the Mexicans shoot
Ins; in the direction in which Watson was
running.
1 i*aw they were not shooting at me.
and. thinking they believed me al
ready dead, 1 took a chance and crawl
ed Into some thicker bushes.
I crawled through the bushes until
I reached the bank of the stream. I
then made my way to a point |Hxba
bly 100 yards from the train. There
I lay under a bank for half an hour
and heard shots by ones, tw os. and
threes. I did not hear any sort of
groans, yells, or cries from our Amer
icane. Then I continued further down
the bank, wading tn the stream part
of the time until I reached a point
about -00 yards from the train. There
I remained half or three quarters of
an hour. Later I found my way to
