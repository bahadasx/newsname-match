LUSITAN1A CASE
CLOSED INCIDENT
GERMANY CONCEDES U. S. CON
TENTION FOR RIGHTS OF
NEUTRAL TRAVELERS
FINAL CONFERENCE BY
LANSING AND BERNSTORFF
Indemnities For 115 American Lives
To Be Paid By German
Government
Washington, Jan. 10.—Count von
Bernstorff, German ambassador, and
Secretary Lansing had another con
ference in the Lusitania negotiations,
which both agreed should be regarded
as confidential.
The ambassador expects to confer
with the secretary again inside of a
week, and then not again on the sub
ject. That fact is taken by those con
versant with the status of the case to
mean that Germany and the United
States have approached a point in the
negotiations where only one more ex
change between Washington and Ber
lin will be necessary before the long
controversy is ended..
"Very Favorable"
American officials in all quarters
declared the situation "as very favor
able," and reflected the view that a
satisfactory statement is in sight
which will include indemnities for
1915 American lives lost, and some
expression of regret or disavowal
which will be mutually satisfactory
to Germany and the United States.
President Wilson, Secretary Lan
sing and the German ambassador are
practically the only officials 'n the se
cret of tiie negotiations, but it is
known that the principal point which
has been delaying final settlement
was phraseology.
Germany has contended that the
best disavowal she could offer is her
orders to the submarine commanders
not to repeat such incident, and that
•he could not disavow the action, al
though she regretted the, loss of so
many American lives.
The United States has been eon
tending that the disavowal should be
expressed in some way. It is believed
that a form of expression has been
found which will be satisfactory to
both. The one more exchange be
tween Washington and Berlin will
settle the case, unless something un
foreseen comes up.
FATHER OF MRS. OVERSON DIES
IN NEW YORK CITY
Late Tuesday evening Mrs. W.
B. Overs on received intelligence by
wire of the death of her father,
Colonel Moses Dillon at his home in
New York City. The news was un
expected as a message a few days be
fore said that while he had been in
disposed he was recovering. Death
resulted from a sudden attack of
pneumonia.
Colonel Dillon has visited Williston
several times and will be remembered
by many local people. Mr. and Mrs.

Chief Justice Fisk
For Supreme Bench
Hon. Charles J. Fisk chief Justice
of the North Dakota Supreme court
and a brother of Judge Frank E.
Fisk of this city, was endorsed by the
members of the Grand Forks Bar as
sociation, to fill the vacancy in the
United States supreme court caused
by the death of Justice Joseph R.

of the srreat West on the United
States supreme bench. A strong res
olution of endorsement was passed
and signed by thirty-three members
of the Grand Forks bar.
PLEASED WITH CONDITIONS
Adam .Hannah of Minneapolis was
in the city yesterday, accompanied bv
two assistants, on his annual tour to
audit the affairs of the institutions in
which he is interested. Mr. Hannah
owns fifteen banks in North Dakota,
five of them being in McKenzie coun
ty and one in this county, at Ray. Mr.
Hannah is well satisfied with the pros
perity North Dakota has enjoyed the
past year and considers property
values and securities much bettsr
than ever before because of the more
thorough and conservative methods
in agriculture and says these will
make for lower interest rates.
t^State Historical
"How Cold Was It"
Inquiry No. 974,642
Yep (to use the favorite affirma
tive of "Old Wl" Mumby, now de
parted) Old Man Zero arrived and
brought with him a long string of lit
tle round, solidly congealed Degrees.
Degrees is their first name and the
worst of it is that their other name
is Below. Twenty-eight was the best
the local weather factory could do last
week but having got his hand in En
gineer Craig broke his own record
all to smithereens this week and
forced the cold lever down till the
indicator read 42 between eight and
nine Wednesday a. m. and the day
averaged about 35 below. With one
exception, a day in 1883, the local sta
tion records no colder day during the
whole period of its establishment,
about 37 yeras
This, Thursday morning, 41 was the
lowest point. There has been very
little breeze during the extreme cold
and except in cases where people
were obliged to make drives over the
drifted roads no suffering or great
inconveniences in carrying on the
routine affairs of daily life have
heard of or anticipated. Eastern pa
pers will please omit the last sen
tence and send the news broad cast.
Railroads are following the safety
first rule and all trains are hours late,
not on account of snow but through
caution and the various delays that
the low temperature cause. Water
pipes and chimneys are the chief
source of concern to householders.
DOCTORS OF CHIROPRACTIC
WILL LOCATE HERE
G. T. Strand and Frances B. Strand,
doctors of chiropractic, have engaged
office rooms in the Graphic building
and will open offices for the practice
of their profession February 1st.
The past three years they have prac
ticed in Carrington and are remov
ing to WUliaton to be in a more cen
tral point and wider field.
The doctors spent several days here
the past week and left Wednesday for
eastern points to stay until their new
offices are ready. Their announce
ment appears in another column.
BELIEVE IN GOOD STOCK
Ashwell brothers, who operate a
farm west of the city on Sand Creek,
are firm believers in well bred stock.
They say that they find thorough
bred stock of all kinds easier to keep,
easier to handle and much more prof
itable. They have secured good ani
mals to place on their farm at several
times and just recently brought in
some fine Scotch short horn cattle.
They also recently shipped from Ken
tucky some well bred Shetland ponies
for use and amusement of their
young folks.

London, Jan. 10.—The British bat
tleship King Edward VII has been
sunk as the result of striking a mine.
The entire crew was saved.
The sinking of the King Edward
VII was announced by the admiralty
in the following statement:
"The H. M. S. King Edward VII
has struck a mine. Owing to the
heavy seas, she had to be abandoned
and sank shortly afterwards. The
ships company was taken off with
out loss of life. Only two men were
injured.
The King Edward was a battleship
of 16,350 tons laid down in March,

and was equipped with four torpedo
tubes, submerged. Her speed on her
trial trip was 19 knots. She had a
complement of 777 men.
The admiralty, supplementing the
announcement, declared there was
absolutely no loss of life, and only two
of the crew were injured.

WORKING ON LONG
CRIMINAL CALENDAR

BUSY WITH QUESTIONS OF
GUILT OR INNOCENCE
McKENZIE COUNTY CASES
ARE ON THIS WEEK
Jury Cannot Eat More Than 75 Cent
Meals Except At Their Own
Expense
The continued work of the district
court is the chief source of interest
for the week. Hotels are filled to
capacity with jurymen, witnesses,
lawyers and those interested in pend
ing cases. The court room is filled
each dav with those who whlie away
the cold winter days following the
spirited legal battles to establish the
certain guilt or absolute innocence
of the defendants. The convictions
and acquittals, to date, are not far
from an even balance.

charged with bootlegging, resulted in
acquittal after the jury had remained

DR. GOLDSCHLAGER A DIRECTOR
At the State Convention of Chiro
practors held at Fargo last week Dr.
Mary Goldschlager of this city was
chosen as a director for the ensuing
year. The meeting was one of the
best ever held in the state. A large
number of addresses were given by
prominent chiropractors and the ses
sion proved very interesting. Here
tofore it has been customary to give
out for publication the papers read
but for various reasons it was decided
this would not be done this time.
Small Fires Become
The Daily Program
"Where is the fire" is a question
that has come to rival the old stand
by:" How cold is it?" Tuesday and
Wednesday the department answered
six or seven alarms all but one in the
residence'districts, the one exception
being the only blaze that resulted in
serious loss. This was the Bruns
wick lodging house on south Main,
the same place that caught last week.
The buildinsr was so badly burned that
part of the roof fdll in and in quench
ing the fire the whole building was
flooded and will be unfit for use with
out extensive repairs which, it is be
lieved will not be permitted under the
building ordinance. The loss on the
building is probably covered by in
surance but the owner, Geo. W. New
ton, will suffer the loss of his business
which is a large item.
The fire started in the woodwork of
the ?t+ic around a new chimney built
last summer. All fires but one start
ed as the result of defective chim
ney flues. All residence fires were
put out with small damage. One
alarm came in as a result of Dr.
Kreiger's automobile becoming excit
ed with "the heat" and bursting into
flame.

WILLISTON, WILLIAMS COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY, JANUARY 13, 1916.
Ray case of the state vs. Ed
Hansel charged with burglary in the
third degree was stubbornly contested
and lasted into Monday. The verdict
was guilty. Owens prosecuting, Bur
dick and Murphy defending.
The McKenzie county case of the
state vs. Lelleslet, charged with the
malicious shooting of an animal was
on Tuesday, States Attorney Shafer
prosecuting, E. R. Sinclair of Minot
defending. After the evidence, or
part of the evidence of the state was
in, the defense moved to enter a new
plea, of guilty.
Yesterday and today the sensation
al case of the State against Frank
Spalding on the charge of adultery
was before the court and jury. This
is also a McKenzie case with Shafer
renresenting the state and Cleary of
Williston defending. While not near
ly so widely known, some of the evi
dence in this case places it on a par
with the celebrated Gillett case tnat
has just recently filled many pages
in the Chicago dailies.
It is said that one of the incidents
of the week's court proceedings was
the restriction of jurymen's meal
checks to 75 cents. Any jurymen
whose appetite is not appeased by the
time that limit is reached must leave
the table with a remnant of hunger
or finish at his own expense.

Fire at an early hour this morning
completely destroyed the three story

Main street, inflicting a property loss
of $107,000, rendered a number of
families and roomers in the building
homeless, and destroyed two big
businesses, one smaller business, stu

besides doing a considerable amount
of damage to adjoining property.
The fire originated near the furnace
in what was known as the Blakey side
of the building. The first alarm wa9
turned in at 4:30 o'clock this morning
and from that time until 9 o'clock,
when it was brought under control,
the firemen fought the flames in a
temperature of twenty below zero.
Seven streams of water were played
on the building and on the adjoining
buildings for more than five hours.
The losses were complete, nothing
being saved in any of the business
hoases or offices or by the people
who were living in the block. The
residents escaped in scanty clothing
and fled to places of safety through
the freezing weather. Shelter was
available at nearby places and no in
conveniences suffered except that of
being rushed from bed in such weath

that one's possessions were being con
sumed in the fire.

be tried at Helena January 24 when
the local witnesses who were subpoe

The legal fight to determine if the

Get Million Dollars
St. Paul, Jan. 7.—Between $600 and
$5,000 in cash and approximately $1,
000,000 in negotiable internal revenue
stamps were stolen from the old fed
eral building here sometime last night
by robbers, who blew open the vault.
The robbery was not discovered until
this morning.'
The police of St. Paul and Minne
apolis and the state authorities joined
with federal agents in an effort to
hunt down the robbers. At the same
time E. J. Lynch, internal revenue
collector, with his office staff, went
to work to check over the contents of
the1 office to determine the exact,
amount secured by the robbers. The
robbery was one of the boldest and
most successful ever executed in the
northwest. A close inspection of the
wrecked vault showed that
fhe
work
evidently had been done by experi
enced individuals. Only one small
hole had been bored in the wall of the
vault to admit the explosive, yet the
door was blown out completely.
Collector Lynch stated that the rob
bers carefully had taken the nego
tiable stamps, leaving a large amount
of unnegotiable stamps.

ENCOURAGEMENT
FOR CONSOLIDATION
THE RECENTLY CONSOLIDATED
TWIN LAKE SCHOOL TO RE
CEIVE 9500 FROM STATE
A telegraphic message received at
the county superintendent's office
from N .C. McDonald, inspector of
rural schools, says, in substance, that
the Twin Lake consolidated school has
been decided elegible to receive stats
aid under the provisions of the state
aid law without rebuilding its school
building, provided the board meets
certain other requirements, the prin
cipal one of which is the employment
of a second teacher, and all of which
can be met without hardship. The
amount of aid will be $500. This tidy
sum will be of great assistance to the
recently consolidated district in get
ting on its feet and the news was very
welcome to Supt. Peterson who re
gards the decision as a victory for
and a source of great encouragement
to consolidation.
Twin Lake school, which is near
Marmon, will be able, under the rul
ing of the inspector, to quality as a
second grade consolidated rural
school.

Four Attacks at Champagne,
France
London, Jan. 10.—While the Rus
sian front has been quiet during the
past 24 hours, there has been severe
fighting in the otjier war theaters.
On the Montenegrin front the Aus
trians have been generally successful
They have advanced their notions*
at several important points despite
the snow waist-deep, and are showimr
themselves just as adept ns the Mon
tenegrins in mountain firhHng.
Germans Repulsed
In the Champagne the French have
repulsed four German attacks. The
Germans, however, have gained a
foothold in the French advanced
trenches. In Persia British reinforce
ments on their way to the relief of
Kut-El-Amara have met Turkish
forces which were compelled to re
tire after same heavy fightiner.
The Petrograd official communica
tion says the calm on the Csernowita
front is due to the heavy lcses anf
resulting demoralization of the Aus
tro-Hungarian army. That there is
some basis for this statement is evi
denced from the estimate of the Hun
garian newspaper, Peter Lvod. that
the losses on both sides of the Bessar
abian battles so far exceed 175.000 or
more than the total British losses int
the Dardanelles campaign.
Bitterest of War
Another Hungarian newspaper
stated on the authority of a staff ren
resentative that the fighting on this
has been the bitterest and bloodiest
in the history of the war, both sides
sacrificing men in a manner without
parallel.
The Saloniki front is cftieflv nota
ble in the day's dispatches as the
scene of the almost continued aero
plane skirmishes, one of which con
tinued for two hours. The Germans
have thus far lost six aeroplanes In
this region.
The Austrian invasion is causing
great uneasiness among the entente
powers and especially Italy, which
sees in its success an end to Italy's
dream of dominating the Albanian
Littoral of the Adriatic.
Situation Not Clear
The situation in Mesopotamia,
where the Turks and British nre en
gaged along the Tigris river, is still
not clear, owing to the divergent re
ports of Constantinople arA T,nnfl«n.
While the British say that the Turks
around Kut-El-Amara are in retreat,
