FRANK FUHR,
Office in First National Bank Building,
MEADE, KANSAS
Alien Recognizes A
Kansas Democrat
Henry Allen, in the Wichita
Beacon, December 23: Some
comment has been created in
Washington by the unusually
line committee assignment which
have gone to Congressman
Shouse of the Seventh Kansas
District. One of the places on
the important committee on bank
ing and currency was awarded
Mr. Shouse in addition to several
other important committee as
signments. No one who really knows Con
gressman Sbouse will regret
these distinctions. When Con
gressman Shouse first came to
Kansas a few years ago from
Kentucky and broke into the
state politics through election to
the State Senate there was a dis
position to take him lightly. He
is a handsome sort of a thorough
bred Kentuckian who seemed to
be out for a good time. The
more the people of Kansas came
to know of Congressman Shouse
the more they were forced to re
alize that he not onlv has fine
.abilities, but also a serious de
sire to use those abilities in bon
iest public service. If the Seventh
'District observes its congress
man carefully they will soon dis
cover that he is giving them ear
nest, modest, able service for the
ttake of the service and that he
has no apparent knowledge as to
where the grandstand is located.
Departed
After an illness of more than
two years, during which time
she bore ber sufferings patiently
and uncomplainingly, Mrs. Skin
ner has been called to ber eter
nal reward. With ber husband
she came to Meade in the early
days, and has since made this
her home.
Harriet Chapman was born in
Townsend, Ohio, February 11th
3 836. Was married to D. Skin
ner September 22, 1855. To this
union three children were born,
all of whom are living. In 1887
the family moved from Bowling
Sweet Will Be Tried
In Grant County
Dodge City .--Archie Sweet will
go to trial at the April term of
the Great county district court
on the charge of killing Nellie
Byers if the present plans of the
Grant county officers are carried
out, according to the Globe.
That is the plan, also, of At
torney General Brewster who
will assist County Attorney II.
W. Stubbs in . the prosecution.
Depuiy Sheriff Hubert McCall
of Grant county is in Dodge City
today and said arrangements are
being made for the trial at New
Ulyses, the Grant county seat.
The plan to try Sweet in Grant
county may be changed by Sweet
if he should decide to demand a
change of venue from the county
in which the crime was commit
ted. So far he has given no in
timation of asking any change of
venue, nor does he exhibit much
interest in the trial so far as can
be judged by his demeanor. He
told Mr. McCall today that he
had not yet engaged an attorney
and has no funds to hire one.
When A Man Dies
I've noticed when a fellow dies, no matter what lie's been,
A saintly chap or one whose iise was deeply steeped in sin,
Flis friends forget the bitter words they spoke but yesterday,
And now they find a multitude of pretty things to say.
I fancy when I go to rest some one will bring to light
Some kindly word or goodly act long buried out of sight;
Hut if it's all the same to you, just give to me instead,
The boquets when I'm living and the knocking when I'm dead
Don't save the kisses to imprint upon my marble brow.
While countless maledictions are hurled upon me now;
Say just one kindly word to me while I mourn here. alone.
And don't save all your eulogy io carve upon a stone.
What do I care if, when I'm dead, The Rloomingdale (ja.eue
Gives me a writeus with a cut in mourning border set?
It will not flatter Be a bit, no mutter what is said, dead
So kindly throw the bouquets now, and knock me mien I'm
It may be line when I am dead to have the folks talk so,
To habe the flowers come in loads from relatives you know:
It may he nice tohave these things foi those you leave behind,
Kut just so far as I'm concerned, I really do not mind.
I'm quite alive anil well to-day, and while I briber here.
Lend me a helping hand nl times give me a word ot cheer:
Just change the game a little bit, just kindly change the decks,
For I will be no judge of (lowers when I've cashed in my checks
