GURREY LEAVES

vice With Board; F. A. Bech
ert May Fill Vacancy
secretary of the Board of Fire, under
writers, has resigned, his resignation,
it is understood, to take effect on Jan
uary 20, at which time the next meet
ing of the board will be held. 7
"Yes. I have resigned," Mr. Gurrey
said today. "But I may continue in
the employment of the board in some
outside capacity. The board wants me
still to keep In touch with the work.
as matters may arise In which I may
be of use."
Asked the reason for his resigna
tion, Mr. Gurrey added that he is "all
worn out" ' . . .. , .
Mr. Gurrey is held to be one of the
best adjusters on the Pacific coast
and in Hawaii. : His service with the
local board has been both a long and
profitable one. ;
While nothing definite cou.d be
learned today, it is understood that
Frank A. Bechert. who has been Mr.
Gurrey's assistant for several years,
is being considered to fill , the vacan
cy. (This, however, will probably be
decided at the meeting on January 20.
LICEMiES
w
OFF FOR YEAR
Though license taxes collected by
the county treasurer's office dmng
the calendar year just closed amount
ed to 'but $108,000 against tlK,5(0
coIIecte(T for the same period in the
year previous. ; the actual number of
licenses issued has increased by 233.
according to Treasurer D. I Conkling.
i Several things have occurred this
year to make the collected totn I low
er, he says. The county has lost bv
the fact that two auction companies
have gone out of business, each com
pany formerly paying $600. A bank,
likewise, with a license fee of $7.0 hav
ceased to exist.
Through an awa root company's go
ing out of bnsiness fees have been les
sened by $.300,, hotel and board ins
house licenses have gone down from
$r0 to $40, which reduction is resion
sible for a loss of at least $2000. and
an allowed reduction for moing pic
ture theaters from one dollar a night
to $200 a year has probably made a
difference of at least $20C0. ,
Territorial taxes still due the coun
ty from what has been collected since
November will amount to about
$16,000, according to word sent In by
the tax, assessor. As soon as this
amount is sent in, the countr treasur
er will balance his books for the year.

HANDLE'-STONE
Great Northern Official . Says
Travel to Islands Will In-
crease During Summer
That there are not now enough
ships on the Pacific to handle the de
mand for first class accommodations
to Honolulu and that the tourist trend
to Hawaii and the western states will
surely increase during the coming
spring and summer, are two opinions
of Cal E. Stone, recently made pas
senger traffic manager of the Great
Northern Railroad. Though Mr. Stone
does not say definitely that the Great
Northern will remain on the Honolulu
run, he seems to anticipate a big pay
ing business in tourist travel to the
islands.
In a statement, made in San Fran,
cisco to the Call and Post on January
4 he said:
"There are not enough ships now
on the Pacific to accommodate the de
mand from the East for first class pas
sage on steamers to Honolulu, and this
Is but the beginning of a movement ot
tourist travel to, the West that is like
ly to surpass the expectations of the
most enthusiastic coast prophets.
Demands Too Large.
"There was some question when the
Great Northern was put on the Hono
lulu run as to whether the amount of
travel would warrant the maintenance
of such a steamer in that service. The
demand for accommodations has ex
ceeded all our anticipations. We .are
daily in receipt of telegrams from
New York, Philadelphia Boston and
the other large eastern cities request
ing de luxe reservations, but we are
far from being able to comply with
them. ;
"The Hawaiian Islands and Califor
nla seem at present to be the principa'
objectives of the great bulk of east
era winter tourist travel and this trsv
el is sure to increase with the com
ing spring and summer."

Mr.. Bcnflis. one of" the owners of

with Mrs. Bonfils on the Great North

"Our sugar industry has' come to be
foiemopt of all our industries in Colo

rado has long been famous ' for her
output of gold and silver, but the beet
sugar business, as far as dollars and
cents go. is now ahead of the mines.
"We produced last 'year,? he says,
"6,000,000 sacks, or 600,000,000 pounds
of beet sugar. Practically ail the peo

With free trades, Mr. Bonfils says,
Colorado could not begin, to compete
with the cheap labor of CUba. Colo
rado land sells, fotrtctically $200 an

to $50 an acre. - Free sugar would

Asked concerning the Mexican situ

question of time when President Wil

end, and the United States take an
active hand to bring the present con
dition of things to a close. '
"Jexico-vis in the feudal' Ages .'till,'
he says. There are a thousand lit

country, and J do not believe that
they will ever settle things of their

"Though Mexico is a republic the

been strangely backward in any ad

government, and willingness to let the
majority rule. It is only a question of
time until we must Interfere." " ; '

EL PASO, Texas, Jan. 13. Public sentiment agaiast further de
lay in securing prompt retribution for the killing of Americans in
Mexico has grown so high here that a petition is being circulated
asking that Col. Roosevelt use his influence with Congress to 'change
the policy of the government which has heretofore refused to exer-
cise its paternal duty to protect American life and property abroad. V'"
Person? with property interests in Mexico are not being allowed
to sign the petition. It is aimed to make it clear that the document
is a protest against lack of action in punishing those who have taken
American life across the border and ruthlessly destroyed property,
but that it has no basis in financial interest.
A report which reached Ei Paso today is that Americans in Chi
huahua are fighting against the band led by Gen. Jose Rolerigues,
who was reported in commanl of the Villistas who killpd the mininr?-
men on Tuesday. It is reported that numbers of the Roderigues
men have been killed and that the Americans are calling for help,
fearing that they will be massacred by superior numbers.. .
Another report is that Rolerigues has been capture! by a force
which included 123 Americans and which was led by Maximiliano
Marquez, an employe of the Hearst ranch interests at Babricora.
This force, together with a few Carranza soldiers, is said to be try
ing to keep order at Madera. Rolerigues and his men, it is
rumored, met the defenders at Madera in a itched battle.
