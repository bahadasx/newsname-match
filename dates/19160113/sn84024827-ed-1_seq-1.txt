De Facto Troops Disappear.
EL PASO, Jan. 12. The number of
' foreigners massacred in the box can-j .
yon, west of Santa Ysabel, Monday, I
is placed at nineteen. It is authprir
tatively stated that General Pablo Lo
pez, a Yaqui chieftan, closely allied
with Villa, commanded the massacre.
About twenty bandits attacked the
train, it is said, while two hundred
frrouped as reserves, stood to one side
of the right of way.
Arrivals from Chihuahua City said
a troop train of twenty cars, conveying
between 500 and 1,000 Carranza troops
nreceeded the mining company special
by about fifteen minutes, leaving the
capita!. An engine and two cars of
this train are said to have been derail
ed by; the bandits in order to stop the
passenger train of -the - Americans.
What became of the Carranza soldiers,
if in the military train, could not be
learned.
The mass meeting, called this after
, noon, was postponed when it was
learned the funeral train, bringing the
bodies to the border, would not arrive
before midnight. It will be held tomor
row. it is said. The delay in the trans
portation of the bodies to the border
here caused muc .dissatisfaction. Late
today the bodies had not left the capi
tal, although tw0 other passenger
trails had come north during the day.
Arrangements had been -made for the
passjge of the bodies upon their arri
val directly across the river to this
city. As the day progressed plans for
a public funeral of all the victims were
abandoned, since relatives from vari
ous Darts 0f the United States claimed
the bodies of the victims.
Thomas B. Holmes, the sole foreign
survivor of the massacre, reached the
border about noon in a state of ner
vous collapse. He said the train left
Chihuahua City about eleven and that
it wag two in the afternoon when, just
outside Santa Ysabel, the train was
stopped. A shout from the right of
way said. "All Gringoes get on here."
"Tom Evans, nearest the- door 0t the
coach," Holmes said, "dropped his mag
azine, went to the door, out on to the

ans, rushed to the door and platform
to see what had happened. I was
ri.zht behind him.
"Watson caught sight of the ban
dits, swung to the' right of way and
ran along the car. I saw him fall un
der a volley of bullets. As I started
down the steps, some one pushed me
and I fell on my face. A volley of
shots went over my head."
Holmes then told how he fled from
the scene after shots were fired to
ward wher he had hidden in the
brush. Two others followed him but
were brought down by the bandits. Re
ports rom the capital are to the ef
fect that ffie body of each victim bears
a bullet wound in the forehead, in ad
dition to other wounds. It is said the
head of C. R. Watson was completely
blow-n off.
Officials of the Mexico Northwestern
Railway said the Carranza government
was not operating the Madera Compa
ny's properties at Madera and Pearson.
It is said a troop train, carrying forty

Schmidt for the criticism but granted
a stay of execution until January 24.
The time of setting the trial of
David Caplan. Jointly indicted with
Schmidt was continued until the same
date. Schmidt declared a detective
vsited him in jail soon after his ar
rival from New York. He said the
detective "asked why I didn't get in

don't want you or Caplan. They want
to hang Tveitmoe and Johannsen.
You can help them. Then you would
be free."
Before sentencing Schmidt the
court listened to the arguments iot
a new trial ami then overruled the
motion.
OREGON HAS SNOWSTORM.
