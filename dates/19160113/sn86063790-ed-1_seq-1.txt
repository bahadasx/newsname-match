Ehrahrdt, Jan. 11.?On Monday
m evening of last week, about store
' ?. v closing time with the Ehrhardt gro*cery,
air. J. Ben Ehrhardt discovered
that his bunch of keys were lost.
K : He told the news, and he, Mr. Harry
* Copeland and two colored delivery
boys secured lights and went out on
a hunt, presumably over the ground,
? ' Ben had been over the previous afternoon;
the hunt was progressing
nicely when Harry opened up full
cry on a new trail.- He trailed until
iirs. Jacob Ehrhardt's hen house'
' was reached, there he bayed, when
. the others came with the light they
frnind that Harry had treed an o'pos
sum in the hen house; the door was
f opened and* Harry made a rush ^or
the'pos', but instead of playing 'pos/
sum he offered fight, which caused
all to stand back. With this free,
. dom he made a break for the branch.
i
Harry immediately gave chase,
- V. * around potato banks, over chicken
^ S > cobps, under and over fences, over^
V taking him in the open field where
V ; Harry bayed again until the light
K arrived. After making him safe he
s^ras carried in and presented to- Mrs.
Jacob Ehrhardt. They tell a good
Joke on Harry; that if he could keep
his nose to the ground, retain his
present speed and had a tail to wag,
he would; be a cracker-jack 'possum
dog. A great feast of 'possum and
v 'taters is promised the day Mrs. Ehrhardt
has'him prepared. (The keys
were found.)

a resident here for the past few
years. Mr. I. J. Zeigler (contracting
builder) died of typhoid
fever, Mr. Zeigler was the town's on
Iy architect, having built moat of
v the stores and dwellings in town.
Mr. Jacob Bhrhardt (merchant and:
-?r. v postmaster for the past thirty years) j
died of apoplexy. Mr. Ehrhardt servthe
public well and was instrument- j
al in the upbuilding of the town.
The new year was saddened last
- Friday morning by the death of Heher
Herndop (died of pneumonia).
I Heber was son of*Mr. and Mrs. G.i
. * J. Herndon. He was just entering
| manhood, about seventeen years of
f age, .and was a promising young man.
His remains were inferred at St.
John's-Baptist church cemetery last

that could be by skilled and loving
hands to retain his fife, but, alas,

A noble young^man. The heart broken

The A. C. IT. freight train changed

ing the whole afternoon to look after
affairs. As it is now to make the
g-.. trip by the train it will require one
F to be away all night and over onehalf
of the next day to attend to only
a few minutes business. So if you
wish to visit Bamberg for two or
three hours' stay, you will have to
hitch up that old mule and leave.beiare
day, same as you did twenty
years ago, unless you have an auto.
I The change in schedule not only
m makes the trip inconvenient, but is
' causing several families and a few

gave the town a good cash trade the
'/whole year 'round, besides being
prominent in the town's social circles.

Master for Aiken County.
Columbia, Jan. 5.?The much tan
giea ana long arawn uui cuuuuvtusy
over the position of master of Aiken
county was ended this afternoon
when Governor Manning appointed J.
E. Murray master for that county,
vice L. M. C. Oliveros, whose term
has expired. Mr. Oliveros was appointed
by C. L. Blease on the death
of the occupant, and the matter was
in controversy, the question being
was Mr. Oliveros to fill out the unexpired
term of four years. As a matter
of fact, he served four, years. It
is said that on agreement between
Mr. Oliveros and Mr". Murray they
entered the primary in 1914 and Mr.

Union, Jan. 8.?Following the
death of a patient, Dr. Theodore
Maddox, a Union physician, was Wednesday
arrested and immediately released
on bail charged with manslaughter.
The warrant was sworn
out by the father of Hulie Studdard,
a lad of 15 years, residing in a mill
village here. Studdard was accidentally
shot by Oliver Austin, a boy of
his own age, while they were hunting
Saturday afternoon.
nr \fftddnv was summoned to at
tend the injured youth. He applied
"first aid" and left at an urgent call
from another patient to whom he
was going when called to the wounded
boy. Two hours later, having answered
the other call, the physician
returned and amputated the leg. The
boy died soon after the operation.
The father claimed loss of blood was
the direct cause of death, and that
lack of prompt attention resulted in
death. The physician says that he
responded to the call even when already
hurrying to another patient,
and that he did all that could be done
at that time; to have operated before
the patient had rallied from the
shock would have meant almost cer
tain death. The verdict of the coroner's
jury was that the lad came
to his death "by misfortune, accidentally."

DEFINES OFFICERS' DUTY.
Governor Insists Upon Enforcement
of Dry Law.
Columbia, Jan. 7.?In opinions
rendered yesterday by Thomas H.
Peeples, attorney general, he held
that none of the provisions providing
for the enforcement of old whiskey
laws have been repealed by the
prohibition act, but have continued.
"The law remains the same," he
says. The opinions were given by
the attorney general upon request of
Gov. Manning.
"In reply thereto I will say that in
my opinion the sections referred to
(sections 828 and 830, criminal code)
are provisions for the enforcement of
the law not inconsistent with the prohibition
act, and are thereby not repealed,
but continued by the said
prohibition act.
Search Warrants. .
"I am of the opinion, therefore,
that magistrates may continue to. issue
search warrants as provided in
section 830 of the code.
"The only change, as I see it, that j
has been made in either of these sections
is that in section 828, in case
of forfeited liquor which has been
seized, such liquors, in all cases,
shall be destroyed publicly by the
sheriff of the county, as tjie dispensary
is abolished in all of the counties."
In another opinion the attorney
general held that constables appointed
by the governor should be paid
"out of the ordinary county funds."
'rms opinion says:
"I am in receipt of yours of the
4th inst., which was Ji&nded me by
your secretary on the 5th inst., In
reference to section 840, volume 2,
criminal code of 1912, and the status
of this section by reason of the
enactment of section 7, act No. 76,
statutes at large, 1915. You ask to
be advised whether or not this section
repeals section 840 of the criminal
code.
"In reply I will say that in my
opinion section 840 of the criminal
code is not only not repealed by the
act of 1915, but is expressly continued;
that act providing that
'Nothing in this act contained shall
be construed to repeal any law defining
the offense, and any penalty,
fine or provisions, penalties and fines
shall remain in full force and effect.'
This section not having been repealled,
I am of the opinion that it is not
necessary that constables appointed
under that act should be reap
pointed.
Pay for Constables.
"The only change that has been
made in my opinion insofar as such
constables are concerned is as to the
manner of their payment. While dispensaries
were in operation in counties
in which dispensary constables
were appointed 'their compensation
was paid by the county dispensary
board out of the profits of the dispensaries.
Since dispensaries no
longer exist in any of the counties,
the compensation of these constables
should be paid out of the ordinary
county funds in such counties where
such constables may be appointed by
the governor.
"As to the appointment of 'constables
generally by the governor and
as to their compensation, I would respectfully
refer you to an opinion
rendered by te assistant attorney
general to you on the 7th of April,
1915, and opinions rendered by myself
to you on the 13th of April,
1915, and 24th of April, 1915, which
- - i? 1 XS1-. T C
you possiDiy nave uu me. n juu
have not I shall be glad to furnish
you copies of same. These opinions
cover all of the questions raised in
your letter of January 4."
After quoting several opinions by
Thomas H. Peeples, attorney general,
bearing on the enforcement of
the prohibition law, Governor Manning
yesterday in a letter to J. Elmore
Martin, sheriff of Charleston
county, said:
"I desire that the constables now
on duty in Charleston county continue
the work they have begun, with
even more vigor and vigilance. The
law has been enacted by the representatives
of the people in the general
assembly. The people have ratified
that law by a tremendous majority.
It is now clearly the duty of
the officers to enforce this law. The
constables appointed by me have, under
this ruling by the attorney general,
full authority under the code to |
enforce the law. The magistrate has
full authority under the law to issue
search warrants for the purpose of
assisting the officers in the enforcement
of this law.
"I desire that: there be no letup ?
whatever in the activity of the officers.
Our duty is plain under the
law, and the law is supreme."

Washington, Jan. 5.?William H.

Representative Lever for postmaster
at Columbia. The recommendation
