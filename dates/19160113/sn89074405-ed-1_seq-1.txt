Bart Cramer, killed by
Mexican bandits in the Gu
errero district in the state of
Chihuahua, Mexico, yester
day, about 100 miles from
the scene of the recent mas
sacre of 17 Americans on the
Mexican Northwestern rail
road, is a brother of Mrs. J.
Haney, 1420 University
avenue, this city.
Associated Press dispatch
es to The Herald brought
Mrs. Haney the first tidings
of her brother's death. De
tails are still lacking.
According to Mrs. Han
ey's theory of the murder of
her brother, a 'band of the
remnants of Villas army, in
order to revenge themselves
on the American govern
ment for the recognition of
Carranza, have taken it up
themselves to slay and
'.lot the property of Ameri
•ui citizens still remaining
Mexico, and especially in
he state of Chihuahua, Vil­

birthplace, and his main
ronghold.
Think Whole Family Lost.
it is feared that a band of these out
:tw.s raided the ranch belonging to ].
Cramer, Mrs. Haney'B father, near
iie famous Babicora ranch, about 15
miles from Minaca, and about 150
miles straight west from Chihuahua
'iiy, and that the father and mother
were murdered, the two oldest eons,
John, aged 34, and Roy, aged 31, and
their families were also killed, and
that Bart, aged 28. the youngest son,
unmarried, attempted to make a dash
for freedom, but was killed in the at
tempt and found later by friends.
Resided There Since 1882.
The Cramer family moved to their
ranch near Minaca in 1882 from Cal
ifornia. After arriving at El Paso,
Tex., they obtained a wagon train,
and in that mdnner made their way
225 miles from El Paso to Chihuahua
City, over mountains, through valleys
and ravines, and all the time in dan
ger from mountain bandits with
which the country was infested.
The family, consisting of Mr. and
Mrs. D. R. Cramer, Miss Cramer, now
Mrs. J. G. Haney, and four sons. Bart,
John, Roy and Albert, settled on one
of the most beautiful and valuable
ranches in Mexico. It holds 2,000
acres in Its broad, fertile plains and
is nestled between mountain ranges
on two sides, and broad clear rivers
on the remaining two sides. Water
there was plenty, the land could not
.have been more fertile, and trees and
vegetation of all kinds grew abun
dantly.
Planted Great Orchard.
A large orchard containing 2,500
apple trees, the trees being imported
from California, which grew and bore
large amounts of fruit under the
warm southern sun. Thorough bred
horses with Arabian blood, and pure
blooded cattle, were imported to the
ranch. A large adobe house, one
story, with the rooms around the out
side, and a store house at one end,
was built where it would overlook all
of the broad possessions of the ranch
owner.
Brother Murdered in 1888.
But in 1888, after they had been
living In this paradise only six years,
as Albert, then 21, was riding alone
to Chihuahua City to obtain supplies,
he was waylaid by bandits along one
of the mountain trails, and killed for
his money. His murderers were
never found.
Knew Villa as a Boy.
Mrs. Haney remembers distinctly,
General Pancho Villa, and his four
brothers when they were little
urchins, running around the streets
of Minaca. The Villa family never
had a days schooling in their life,
and from the first the boys showed a
tendency to bully their smaller com
panions. When they grew larger,
they went to the mountains and be
came bandits, under the leadership
of their older brother, Pancho.
Not Back in 14 Years.
Fifteen years ago, when Mr.
Haney was on a hunting trip to the
state of Chihuahua, he obtained a po
sition on a railroad, as assistant to
an agricultural agent, and for a year
worked at that position. It-was at
thls ttme that he first met Miss Cram

BISHOP QUAYLE
SPEAKS OF WORK
Tells of Importance of Insti

perimental Stage.
Business men of Grand Forks, who,
by attending last night's dinner, tes
tified as to their interest in Wesley
college and Its work, soon will be
given opportunity to give practical
expression to their faith In the institu
tion by subscribing to the college ^en
dowment fund.
The local campaign? 'whielvwill be
the tirst In ten years, is in line with
"the ettdjrttanent carnpaigiTUlat Is be
ing made throughout the state, and
will be one of the first big moves in
the efforts to secure a new building
for the institution.
yew Building Needed.
The immediate and urgent need of
Wesley college is a recitation build
ing, both for the department of ex
pression and the school of religion.
The latter is forced to hold classes in
a comparatively small room in the
basement of a resident hall, and the
expression department has to co-op
erate with the piano, voice and organ
departments In the use of the audi
torium of Corwln hall.
If sufficient funds can be raised,
(his building will be erected during
t.ho summer months, so that it will be
available for use at the opening of
next year's college session.
Quayle Boosts College.
Bishop W. A. Quayle of St. Paul,
one of the foremost Methodist Episco
pal divines in the country and an
orator of national repute, came to
Grand Porks yesterday primarily to
boost Wesley college and to give im
petus to the endowment campaign. In
his address at the Commercial club
last night, he s^oke of the great work
that Wesley college is doing and of
the work that lies before it. He plac
ed the work of the institution before
the business men so concretely, so in
terestingly and so forcefully that the
men were thoroughly impressed with
the importance of the college. Many
declared that they would be more
than pleased to subscribe, and one
man in particular spoke to Dr. E. P.
Robertson about making an immedi
ate subscription, as he would not be
in the city when the campaign waft
made.
Dr. E. P. Robertson, the successful
and popular executive of the institu
tion, said today that a thorough cam
paign will be made in Grand Forks.
It is ten years since the people of this
city have been asked to make any
concerted movement in behalaf of the
institution, and, as many had express
ed their willingness to assist In devel
oping the college and carrying on Its
work, the time Is ripe for such a cam
paign. It is especially ripe at this
time, as the needs of the institution
are so exigent.
Hill Offers $85,000.
Two hundred thousand dollars are
needed to endow the institution.
James J. Hill, who has. helped so
many institutions of th'e northwest,
has offered $25,000 when the college
has raised $175,000. The work of
raising this money has-been going on
for some time, and much progress has
been made.

STRATEGIC
Of OCCUPANCY
NOTRECBVED
Official Statement by Petro
grad That Offensive is
Arrested.
THREE OBJECTS
IN EASTERN MOVE
Maintained That German
Drive in West was Les
sened Through Attack.
London, Jan. 13.—News from the
eastern front of the Russian capture
of Sadgura is regarded in military
circles as probably true, although of
ficial announcement on the subject
has not been received.
The town, which lies a few miles
northeast of Czernowitz, Is the con
verging point for five good roads and
is of considerable startegic import
ance. Previous attempts to capture
it have been stoutly resisted.
Experts say Badgura Is really of
more importance than Czernowitz on
account of its stronger natural posi
tion and facilities for communication
purposes-
Offensive Not Concluded.
A report from Petrograd that thei
offensive In Gallcla and Bessarbla has
been suspended for the present is re
garded as at least premature.
The Russian offensive could not, it
Is believed, be suspended suddenly,
as it was undertaken after a care
ful preparation and launched with
unexpected strength.
The object of that offensive is said
to be three-|old: to demonstrate to the
Rumanians that the Russian forces
are -able "to assume the initiative when
they choose: to divert the Austro
German forces from the Balkans and
the western front, and to improve the
general strategic position of their own
left flank.
Full Effect Uncertain.
While the full effect of this Russian
offensive cannot yet be determined,
the entente military experts affirm
that the second object is attained
that the situation in the Balkans is In
a measure relieved and that the op
eration undertaken by the Germans
against the French in Champagne
was robbed of its force.
Protest From Greece.
The fact that the French flag is
waving over the palace on the Island
of Corfu, which belonged to the Ger
man emperor, and that occupation of
the Greek island by the entente is
considered as complete, has, it is re
ported, already evoked a protest from
the Greek government. It is said that
the protest is largely formal, and that
the allies have given Greece guaran
tees regarding their intention. The
occupation is for the purpose of pre
venting the Serbian army from risk
ing the danger of starvation.
Austrians Are Five
Miles From Antivari
Paris, Jan. 13.—The Austrian
forces, advancing from Cattaro and
Budna, have reached Mitehltez, five
mileB from Antivari, which is being
bombarded by Austrian long-range
guns, according to a dispatch to
L'Oeuvre under Thursday's date.
Montenegrins Prepare
to Quit Their Capital
Paris, Jan. 13.—In view of Austri
an offensive against Mount Lovcen,
Montenegro, measures have been
taken by. the Montenegrin govern
ment to evacuate Cettlnje immediate
ly, according to a Scuitaria dispatch,
says the Petit Journal's Milan cor
respondent. The government, how
ever, has decided to continue the
struggle against the Austrians, the
dispatch adds.
Attack on Allies
Developing Fast
Rome, Jan. 13.—The attack of the
Teutonic Allies on the Entente forces
defending Salonlki is being developed
on a large scale, according to an
Athens correspondent of Giornale
N*.Italoe, telegraphing under Tues
day's date. He reports that the
bombardment of the British line to
the Doiran zone proceeded all day
Monday-
The German commander of the at
tacking force, says the correspondent,
will make use of the Austrian, Bul
garian and Turkish forces. Participa
tion of the Turks has been doubtful,
he adds, but it is now certain that
they will be included in the attacking
army.
