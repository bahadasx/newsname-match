CHAPTER IX.
Shorty Dreams.
"^■^UNNY you don't gamble none,"
Shorty said to Smoke one
night in the Elkliorn. "Ain'
It in your bloodV"
"It is," Smoke answered. "But the
statistics are in my bend. 1 like an
even break for my money."
All about them. In the huge barroom
urose the click and rattle and rumble
of a dozen games, at which fur clad,
moceasitied men tried their luck. Smoke
waved his band to include them all
"Look at them," be said "It's cold
mathematics that they will lose more
tbau they win tonight-that the hi
proportion are losing right now ."
"You're strong on tiggers." Shorty
murmured admiringly "An', in the
main, you're right. But they'* such
tiling as facts. An' one fact 1» streaks
of luck Tlie only way to win at gam
blin' is wait for a hunch that yon'y
got a lucky streak coinin' an' then pin
it to the roof.
"It sounds simple." Smoke criticised
"so simple I can't see how men enn
lose."
"The trouble is." Shorty admitted
"that most men get fooled on their
hunches. On occasion I sure get fool
ed on mine. The thing is to try an
And out"
Smoke shook his head. "That's
statistic, too. Shorty. Most men prove
wrong on their hunches."
"But don't you ever get one of them
streaky feeiin's that all you got to do
is put your money down an' pick
winner?"
Smoke laughed. "I'm too scared of
the percentage against me. Rut I'
teil you what. Shorty. I'll throw a dol
iar on thp high card, right now. and
see if it will liny us a drink."
Smoko was edging his way in to the
faro table when Shorty caught hls arm
"Hold on! I'm gettin' one of them
hunciies now You put that dollar on
roulette."
They went over to a roulette table
near the bar.
"Wait till l give tlie word." Shorty
counseled.
"What number?" Smoke asked.
"Pick it yourself. But wait till I say
jet her go.' 1
"Yon don't mean to say I've got an

ued.
"As good as the next geezer's."
"But not as good as the bank's."
"Wait an' see." Shorty urged. "Now!
Let her go!"
The gamekeeper had just sent the
little ivory ball whirling around tlie
moot!) rim above the revolving, many
slotted wheel. Smoke, at the lower
end of the table, reached over a player
nd blindly tossed the dollar. It slit!
long the smooth green cloth aud stop
ped fairly in the center of "34."
The hall came to a rest, aud the
gamekeeper announced. "Thirty-four
lus.'" He swept the table and along
Ide of Smoke's dollar stacked $35.
Smoke drew tbe money lu. and Shorty
slapped him ou the shoulder.
"Now. that was the real goods of a
hunch. Smoke! How'd I know it?
here's no tellln'. 1 Just knew you'd
wlu. Why. if that dollar of yourn'd
fell on any other number It'd won Just
tbe same. When the hunch is right
ou Just can't help whinin'."
"Suppose It had come double
naught?" Smoke queried as they made
their way to the bar.
"Then your dollar'd been on double
naught." was Shorty's answer. "They's
no gettin' away from it A hunch is a
hunch. Here's how. Come on back
the table. I got a bunch, after
pickin' you for a winner, that l can
pick some few numbers myself."
"Are you playing a system?" Smoke
asked at the end of ten minutes, when
his partner had dropped $100.
From Idly watching Smoke became
isclnated. following closely every de
ail of the game from the whirling of
the ball to the making and the paying
of the bets. He made no plays, how
ever, merely contenting himself with
miking on. Yet so Interested was lie
that Shorty, announcing that he had
had enough, with difficulty drew
Smoke away from the table.
Tbe gamekeeper returned Shorty the
gold sack he had deposited as a cre
dential for playing and with it went a
slip of paper on which was scribbled
'Out—$350." Shorty carried the sack
aud the paper across the room ami
handed them to the weigher, who sat
behind a large pair of gold scales. Out
of Shorty's sack he weighed $2r>0.
which he poured into the coffer of the
bouse.
"That hunch of yours was another
one of those statistics," Smoke Jeered
"1 had to play it, didn't L in order
to find out?" Shorty retorted.
"Never mind. Shorty," Smoke laugh
ed. "I've got a hunch right now"—
Shorty's eyes sparkled as he cried
eagerly: "YVhat is it? Kick in an' play
it pronto."
'It's not that kind. Shorty. Now.
bat. I've got is a hunch that some
day I'il work out a system that will
beat the spots off that table."
'System!" Sborty groaned, then sur
veyed his partner with a' vast pity
'Smoke, listen to your side kicker an'
leave system alone. Systems is sure
losers. They ain't uo bunches in sys
terns."
That's why I like them." Smoke an
swered. "A system Is statistical.
When you get the right system you
can't lose, and that's the difference be
tween it and a hunch. You never
know when the right hunch is going
wrong."
"But I know a lot of systems that
went wrong, an' I never seen a system
win." Shorty paused and sigtied.
"Look here. Smoke, if you're gettin'
cracked on systems this ain't uo place
for you, an' it's about time we tiit the
trail again."
At last, after long hours aud days
spent at watching the table, the night
came when Smoke proclaimed that he
was ready, and Shorty, glum aud pes
simistic. accompanied his partner to
the Elkliorn. Smoke bought a stack
of chips and stationed himself at tlie
gamekeeper'* end of tlie table. Again
and again the bail was whirled and
the other players won or lost, but
Smoke did not venture a chip. Shorty
waxed impatient.
Buck in. buck in!" he urged. "Let's
get this funeral over! Got cold feet?
Smoke shook his head and waited
A dozen plays went by, and then sud
denly lie placed ten one-do!lar chips on
''2(5.' The number won, and the keep
er paid Smoke $350, A dozen plays
went by. twenty plays and thirty,
when Smoke placed $10 on "32." Again
he received $350.
"It's a hunch." Shorty whispered vo
eiferously in bis ear. "Hide it; ride
it!"
Half an hour went by, during which
Smoke was inactive; then he placed
$10 on "34" and won.
"A hunch!" Shorty whispered.
"Nothing of the sort," Smoke wliis
pered back. "It's the system, isn't
she a dandy?"
Smoke now altered bis play. He bet
more frequently, with single chips
scattered here and there, and be lost
more often than he won.
"Quit it." Shorty advised. "Cash in
You've rung the bullseye three times
an' you're ahead a thousand. You
cau't keep it up."
At this moment the ball started
whirling, and Smoke dropped ten chip*
on "2(5." The ball fell into the slot of
"2G," and the keeper again paid him
$350.
"If you're plumb crazy an' got the
immortal cinch bet 'em tbe limit.'
Shorty said. "Put down twenty live
next time."
A quarter of aii hour passed, durln"
which Smoke won and lost on smai:
scattering bets. Then, with (lie abrupt
ness that characterized Ills big bet
ting, he placed $25 on "00." and the
keeper paid him $875
"Wake me up, Smoke: I'm dream
in," Shorty moaned.
Smoke smiled, consulted his note
book and became nbsorlwd In calcula
tion. He continually drew the note
book from his pocket and from time to
time Jotted down figures.

A crowd had packed 4Éetïsely around
tue ta ole, while the "players them
selves were attempting to cover the
same numbers lie covered. It was
then that a change «She over his
play. Ten times in "riTuCeession he
placed $10 on "18" and iost. At this
stage he was deserted the hardiest.
He changed his uumbët and won an
other $350. Ini mediator the players
were back with him. deserting again
after a series of losing t«ts.
"Quit it. Smoke: qiiitiit!" Shorty ad
vised "The longest string of hunches
is only so long, au' your string's fin
ished. No more bullseye* for you."
"I'm going to ring her once again
before 1 cash in," Smoke answered.
For a few minutes. «With varying
luck, he played scattering chips over
the table aud then dropped $25 on
" 00 ."
"I'll take my slip now," he said to
the denier as he won. ***
"Oil. you don't need to show it to
me," Shorty said as they walked to
tlie weigher. "1 been keepin' track.

Smoke Became Absorbed In Calculation
You're somethin' like thirty-six hun
dred to the'good. How near am I?"
"Thirty-six sixty." Smoke replied.
"Don't crowd your luck," Shorty
piöaded »-wtth Smoke- tlS& west -"night
in tiie cabin as he evidenced prepara
tions to return to the Elkliorn. "You
played a mighty long string of hunches,
but you played it out If you go back
you'!! sure drop all yonr winnin's."
"But I tell you it isn't hunches.
Shorty. It's statistics. It's a system
It can't lose."
"System tbe devil. They ain't no
such a thing as system.- Y'ou got to
show me."
"I did show you. Come on with me
now, and I'll show you again."
When they entered tbe Elkborn all
eyes centered on Smoke, aud those
about tlie table made way for him as
he took up his old place at the keeper's
end. His play was quite unlike that
of the previous night In the course
of an hour and a half be made only
four bets, but each bet was for $25,
and each bet won. He cashed in
$3,300, and Shorty carried the dust
home to the cabin.
"Now's tlie time to Jump the game,'
Shorty advised as he sat on the edge
of tiis bunk and took off his moccasins,
"You're seven thousan' ahead. A
man's a fool that'd crowd hls luck
harder."
"Shorty, a man would be a blitherln
lunatic if be didn't keep on backing a
winning system like mine."
"Smoke, you're a sure bright boy
You know naore'n a minute than I
could know in forty thousan' years.
But I've been around some an' seen a
few, an' I teil you straight an' eonll
dentin I an' all assurin' a system to
beat a bankin' game ain't possible."
"But I'm showing you this one. It'
a pipe."
"No, you're not. Smoke, ft's a pipe
dream. I'm asleep. Bimeby I'll wake
up au' buiid the fire an' start break
fast."
The third night of play as Smoke
iaid bis first bet the gamekeeper sbov
ed $15 back to him.
"Ten's ail you can play," he said
"The limit's come down."
"Gettin' picayune," Shorty sneered.
"No one has to play at this table
that don't want to." the keeper retort
ed. "And I'm willing to say straight
out in meeting that we'd sooner your
parilncr didn't play at our table.'"
"Scared of his system, eh?" Shorty
challenged as the keeper paid over
$350
Night by night Smoke continued to
win His method of play varied. Ex
pert after expert in the Jam about tbe
taiile scribbled down bis bets and num
bers in vain attempts to work out his
system. They complained of their in
ability to get a clew to start with and
swore that it was pure luck, though
the most colossal streak of it they had
ever seen.
It was Smoke's varied play that ob
fuscated them. Sometimes, consulting
his notebook or engaging in long cal
«'illations, an hour elapsed without his
staking a chip. At other times he
would win three limit bets and clean
up a thousand dollars and odd in five
sr ten minutes.
At still other times his tactics would
he to scatter single chips prodigally
arid amazingly over the table. This
would continue for from ten to thirty
minutes ot play, when abruptly, as the
ball whirled through the last few of
its circles, he would play the limit oa
column, color and number and win ali
three. Once, to complete confusion iß
the minds of those that strove to di
me his secret, he lost forty straight
bets, each at tlie limit. But each
night, play uo matter how diversely.
Shorty carried home $3,500 for him.
"It ain't no system," Shorty expound
ed at one of their bed going discus
sions. "I follow you an' follow you,
but they ain't uo figgerin' It out- You
never play twice the same. All you do
is pick winners when you want to, an'
when you don't want to you Just on
purpose don't"
"Maybe you're nearer right than you
think. Shorty. I've Just got to pick
losers sometimes. It's part of the sys
tem."
"System the devil! I've talked with
every gambler in town, an' the last
one is agreed they ain't no such thing
as system."
"Y'et I'm showing them one all the
time."
CHAPTER X.
Th« Warp In Fortune's Wheel.
X the sixth night of play at
the Elkborn tbe limit was re
duced to $5.
"It's all right." Smoke as
sured the gamekeeper. "1 want $3.
500 tonight, as usual, aud you only
compel me to play longer. I've got to
pick twice as many winners; that's
all"
"Why don't you buck somebody
else's table?" the keeper demanded
wrathfuily.
Because i like this one." Smoke
glanced over at the roaring stove only
a few feet away. "Besides, there are
no drafts here, and it is warm and
comfortable."
On the ninth night, when Shorty had
arried the dust home, he had a lit.
"I quit. Smoke; I quit." he began
'1 know when I got enough. I ain't
dreamiu'. I'm wide awake. A system
can't be, but you got one just the
same. There's nothin' in the rule 0
three. The almanac's clean out. The
world's gone smash. There's nothin
regular an' uniform no more. The
multiplication table's gone loco. Two
is eight, nine is eleven, and two times
two is eight hundred an' forty-six—an
half. Anything is everything, an
nothin's ail. an' twice ail is coid

"You've got a system. Figgers beat

somebody! Oh, wake me up!"
The next morning a visitor came to
the cabin. Smoke knew him—Harvey
Moran, the owner of all the games In
the Tivoli. There was a note of appeal
in his deep, gruff voice as he plunged
into his business.
"It's like this. Smoke," he began
"You've got us all guessing. I'm rep
resenting nine other game owners and
myself from all tbe saloons in town
We don't understand. We know that
no system ever worked against rou
lette. All the mathematic sharps in the
colleges have told us gamblers tlie
same thing. They say that roulette it
self is the system, the one aud only
system, and therefore that no system
can beat it. for that would mean arith
metie has gone bughouse."
"Well, you've seen me play," Smoke
answered defiantly, "and. if you think
it's only a string of luck on my part
why worry?"
"That's the trouble. We can't help
worrying. It's a system you've got and
all the time we know it can't be. I've
watched you five nights now. and all I
can make out is that you favor certain
numbers and keep on winning.
"Now. the ten of us game owner
have got together, and we want t<
make a friendly proposition We'll
put a roulette table in a back room of
the Elkliorn. pool the bank against
you aud have you buck us. It will be
all quiet and private—Just you and
Shorty and us. What do you say?"
"I think It's tbe other way around.'
Smoke answered. "It's up to you to
come and see me. I'll be playing in
the barroom of the Elkhorn tonight
You can watch me there just as well."
That night when Smoke took np hls
customary place at the table the keep
er shut down the game. "The games
closed." he said. "Boss' orders."
But the assembled game owners
were not to be balked, in a few min
utes they arranged a pool, each putting
in a thousand, and took over the table
"Come on and buck us," Harvey Mo
ran challenged as tlie keeper sent tbe
ball on its first whirl around.
"Give me the twenty-five limit?"
Smoke suggested.
"Sure: go to it."
Smoke immediately placed twenty
five chips on "OO" and won.
Moran wiped tbe sweat from hts
forehead. "Go on." he said; "we got
ten thousand in this bank "
At the end of an hour and a half
the ten thousand was Smoke's.
"Got enough?" Smoke asked.
The game owners looked at oue an
Dther. They were awed. They, the
"atted proteges of the laws of chance,
»■ere undone.
"We quit." Moran said. "Ain't that
fight. Burke?"
Big Burke, who owned tlie games In
the M. and G. saloon, nodded. "The
Impossible lias happened." he said
"This Smoke here has got a system all
right. If we let him go on we'll all
'oust. AM i can see. If we're going to
keep our tables running, is to cut down
the limit to $i or 10 cents or 1 cent.

such stakes."

All looked at Smoke. He shrugged
his shoulders.
"In that case, gentlemen. I'll have
to hire a gang of men to play at all
your tables. I can pay them $10 for u
four hour shift aud make money."
"Then we'll shut down our tables,"
Big Burke replied, "unless"—he hesi
tated and ran his eye over hls fellows
to see that they were with him—"un
less you're willing to talk business.
What will you sell the system for?"
"Thirty thousand dollars," Smoke an
swered, "That's a Lax of $3,000 apiece."
They debated and nodded. "And
you'll tell us your system?"
"Surely."
"And you'll promise not to play rou
lette in Dawson ever again?"
"No, sir," Smoke said positively. "I'll
promise not to play this system again."
Great Scott!" Moran exploded. "You
haven't got other systems, have you?"
"Hold on!" Shorty cried. "I want to
talk to my partner. Come over here.
Smoke, on tbe side."
Smoke followed into a quiet corner
of the room, while hundreds of curious
eyes centered on him aud Shorty.
"Look here. Smoke." Shorty whisper
ed hoarsely, "niebbe it ain't a dream,
in which ease you're .sellin' out al
mighty cheap. You've sure got the
worid by tlie slack of its pants. They'*
iious in it. Shake it! Shake it
hard! If you sell out for thirty thou

"When I sell out for thirty thousand
you'll fall on my neck an' wake up to
find out that you haven't been dream
ing at all. Tills is no dream. Shorty
In about two minutes you'll see you
have been wide awake all the time
Let me tell you that when I sell out
it's because I've got to sell out."
Back at the table Smoke informed the
game owners that his offer still held.
They proffered him their paper to the
extent of three thousand each.
"1 was about to intimate that I'd
take the money weighed out." Smoke
said.
The owner of the Elkhorn cashed
their paper, and Shorty took possession
of the gold dust
"Now I don't want to wake up," he
chortled as lie hefted the various sacks
"Toted up. it's a seventy thousan'
dream It'll be too blamed expensive
to open my eyes, roll out of tbe blan
ket an' start breakfast."
"What's your system?" Big Burke
demanded. "We've paid for it. and we
want it."
Smoke led the way to the table
"Now, gentlemen, bear with me a mo
ment This isn't an ordinary system
It can scarcely be called legitimate,
but its one great virtue Is that it
works. I've got my suspicions, but I'm
not saying anything. You watch. Mr.
; Keener, be ready w/.th th/> bail. Walt
I am going to pick '2G.' Consider I've
bet on it Be ready, Mr. Keeper.
Now!"
The bail whirled around.
"You observe." Smoke went on. "that
'9' was directly opposite."
The ball finished in "26."
Big Burke swore deep in his chest
and ail waited.
"For '00' to win 'll* must be oppo

"But the system?" Moran demanded
impatiently. "We know you can pick

those numbers are, but how do yon

Big Burke, with a sudden flash of
comprehension, reached over, stopped
the wheel and examined It carefully
The heads of the. nine other game
awners lient over and joined in the
examination. Big Burke straightened
up and east a glance at the nearby

H« Know Their Weakness.
During the reign of Louis XV. of
France the light chaise came into fash
ion. and great ladies of Paris were ac
customed to drive in them about tHe
city. But beautiful hands are not al
ways strong ones. Accidents began to
occur more aud more frequently in the
streets. Consequently, says "Das Buch
Fur Alle," the king besought tlie min
ister of police to do something, since
tlie lives of pedestrians were constant
ly in danger.
"I will do whatever is in my power,"
replied tlie police minister. "Your maj
esty desires that these accidents cease
entirely?"
Tbe king replied, "Certainly."
The next day there appeared a royal
ordinance that ordered that in tlie fu
ture Indies under thirty years of age
should not drive chaises through tlio
streets of Paris. That seems a mild
restriction, but it is said that scarcely
a woman from that time on drove her
own chaise. Tlie police minister knew
that few women would care to adver
tise the fact thht they were over thir
ty and that the rest would probably
be too old to drive anyway.
Napoleon's "Nina Lives."
The surrender of Napoleon to the
captain of the Bellerophon. when that
event became known in England, was
discredited by many, for at least eight
times previously he had been reported
dead, says the Westminster Gazette.
The list of his deaths published lu a
contemporary Journal is interesting.
He iost the first of his nine lives in
a battle on the Dnieper, where he re
ceived "five mortal wounds and ex
pired as he gave his sword to Prince
Kutusoff." Later he was twice
drowned, once "wiilie crossing the
Mosqua" aud again in Moscow, "where
lie lost his way and fell into a reser
voir." Daring the retreat from Mos
cow he was suffocated in hls tent and
a few days later buried 5.000 fathoms
deep. In a fall of .snow. Finally lie
reaSbecL Aacis. ftvkcm his exS nji jgrated
subjects immediately lynched him.
These were some of the many fables
concerning Napoleon which found their
way into the newspapers u century
ago.
Assiniboia.
The name of Assiniboia was former
ly at different times applied to two dis
tricts in Canada, but now belongs
proi>eriy to none. Tlie first was the
district formed in 1835 by the Hud
son's Bay company, having in it Fort
Gary, at the junction of tlie Ued aud
Assiniboiue rivers, in Rupert's Land.
It ceased to exist when Rupert's Lund
was transferred to Canada in 1S70.
The second regions, known until re
cently as Assiniboia, was a district of
the Northwest territories, given defi
nite existence by an act of tlie Domin
ion parliament in 1875. It extended
from the western boundary of Mani
toba to the line of 111 degrees west
and from the parallel of 49 degrees
north to 52 degrees north. Saskatche
wan lay to the nortli of the district,
and in 1905 the two were united, with
slightly different boundaries, under the
name of Saskatchewan.
A Curious Wedding Present.
Among tlie Brass river tribes of
West Africa when a young couple get
married it is the custom for the oldest
member of the bride's family to pre
sent the bride with a plot of ground
six feet long. This is for the grave of
her family and herself when they die.
Tbe first member of tbe new family
who dies is buried about twenty feet
below ground and tlie next one almost
sixteen feet mid this goes on until all
the family die and are buried. The
grave holds them all, and this, they
think, prevents them from being sep
arated. This grewsome wedding pres
ent is tbe one most valued by the
bride, tlie favorite native saying being,
"When all other tilings are gone this
remains."

All Extra.
"There's some mistake about this
bill." said the departing guest. "You
told me your rates were $5 a day."
"So they are." said the genial hotel
proprietor, "but that's just for having
your name on tbe register. Rooms and
board are extra."—Pittsburgh Press.
