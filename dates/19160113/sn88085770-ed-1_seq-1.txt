The Struggle Abroad
BROTHERHOOD OF PAIN THE BRITISH PRUSSIAN
An Oxford undergraduate serving
with the Koyal Engineers in France,
writes the following account of a
scene behind the British front:
I went up as far as the entrance, to
the communication trenches and
watched the wounded coming out. It
Was a sight I shall never forget.
About one-fourth of the men coming
out were Germans, wounded . . . the
wounded and our wounded were strag
gling? out, apparently the greatest
friends. It was a fellowship bond of
suffering, a brotherhood of pain.
Those who could walk were sup
porting those who could not. I saw
two Germans, wounded, the one in
the head, the other in the arm, sup
porting between them a Scottish sol
dier with a shrapnel wound in both
thighs.—"Daily Mail," 12-10-15.
"Apparently the greatest friends. A
fellowship bond of suffering." Yes.
possibly, until then they had never
realized that they had had no quar
rel, perhaps never met before; but,
alas, the trumpet-call had sounded,
their masters had fallen out and were
going to settle their differences by '
force of arms and they had been goad- '
ed to take sides in the dispute.—Lon

The Cathedral Beautiful
BY CARL ULONSKA
Today in America thousands of good and well-meaning citi
zens are voicing an active and eloquent protest against the
destruction of the world's greatest cathedrals; those vast and
magnificent piles of marble, stone and granite, towering and
massive in their grandeur—inspiring and soul stirring. That
protest is timely and warranted. I too protest against the de
struction of these vast piles of resplendent art. I protest against
the destruction of our inheritance of the Renaissance, the
Rhiems, St. Paul and the Louvre, but I also protest against the
wanton destruction of the world's greatest cathedral —throbbing,
living and breathing. You protest against the destruction of
temples of marble but I cry out against the wholesale destruc
tion of the builders of temples. I raise my voice in protest
against the destruction of every temple that breathes, that sings,
that dreams, that loves, every temple whose shrine is a human
heart and whose stained windows are glowing eyes of hope and
inspiration. I cry out against the cruel destruction of the
world's grandest cathedral, the cathedral of the Infinite —Human
Life.
NORTHWEST WORKER
The increased rent campaign of a
section of the masters serves a useful
purpose in once >igain emphasising
the Unique "oneness" of the nation
in this its hour of suffering. In our
perusal of the prews we notice that
there 1h complete unanimity In this
respect with the international master
class. So strong is the pressure* In
some parts that we find the wives of
the men who are fighting "our" bat
tles so filled with righteous wrath
and Indignation that a deputation, ac
companied by thousands of women,
waited upon the Glasgow Corporation
to protest against Increases of rent.
We are told that they carried a ban
ner with the Inscription:
Our husbands, sons, and broth
ers are fighting the I'russlana of
Germany; we are fighting the
Prussians of Patrick. —"Daily Chron
icle." 8.10.15.
Such pungent sarcasm as this was
not allowed to go unnoticed and we
find the matter raised In the House
of Commons on the motion for ad
journment, when a member stated
that "this kind of thing (raising renti
is going to sow industrial discontent
and unrest."
A few days later in the columns of
the same paper we find halfa-column
devoted to the case of a woman in
Germany, whose husband had been
at the front since the beginning of the
war, and who had received a letter
from her landlord asking for the pay
ment of the balance of her rent with
in _4 hours, otherwise steps would
he taken. Bhe had pa.v tier rent regu
larly until t«o months ago, when bad
health had overpowered her.
Vcerwaerts then points out to its
readers that the woman's husband
has been fighting for more than a
year to defend this landlord's house,
a man who is sitting at his ease in
Berlin raking in his rents which have
not been reduced by one pfennig. The
shopkeepers also are charging the |
woman exorbitant prices for every j
necessary of life. Thanks to their skill
'n exploiting the poor and wretched,
the woman got behind with her rent.
She found it impossible to makp. both
ends meet . . . and thereupon down
comes this blood-sucker and threat- ,'
ens to throw her out of house and
home. And all the time her husband,
who was torn away from his work, is
keeping the Watch on the Hhino and :
endangering his life for the Father
land.—"Daily Chronicle," 11-10-15.

KAUTSKY'S OPINION
After 1870) tli(> next wars that 00
--cupted tinl attention of the German
Socialists wen- the Balkan rebellions
iiKaiiiHt Turkey In 1878 and Hip Hub
■O-Turkilh war In 1877-78. The dif
ference! of opinion aroused by theie
evtnti among Socialists are describ
ed by Kautsky In an article on "In
tornatlonallsm ami War," In Neve,
/.(•it, XXXIII, Vol. 1, No. 8.
"Th(> ittuatlon reiembled that of
the Crimean war, yet hail allO be

had made considerable progreii 'lur
ing the two decades since the peace
of Paris. They demanded their In
dependence, their reparation from

Tsar.
"Whose side should the Social -De
mocracy take? Should they become
partisans of the oppressed, as befits
a Soclaldemocrat? Hut would not that
signify bestowing supreme power and
dangerousness upon the Tsar, the
most menacing enemy of all European
liberty? By no means, replied thel
partisans of the Balkan nations.
These nations are friendly to Russia
only so long as no other European
power takes care of them. Strong
Democratic states of nations In souttt
■ astern Europe would form a better
bulwark against Russian despotism

corrupt state of many nationalities
undermined by its own internal trou

their national independence, is an j
idea that would grow with tne Eco
nomic development and that would
possess the future. By leaving the j
protection of the Balkan nations to I

I with such powers ns are inherent in'^
j those who work in the direction of
necessary evolution. Precisely for
the purpose of weakening Russia's In
fluence in the Balkans, should Europe
defend the Balkan nations against
Turkey.
THE BALKAN QUESTION
"A live discussion followed in the
party press. On the side of the Turk
ish friends were the old and most re
spected comrades, such as Lieb
knecht, Marx, Engels, whereas only
young and liiiinfluent ial comrades
on Hm' opposite side. At that.
time I launched my first controversy
in the party press on International
politics in opposition to the views
of our old leaders. The two conflict
ing views were expressed in two
pamphlets, whose titles were s\i-nili
cant. One of them, written by Meb
knecht, was entitled: Concerning the!
Oriental Question, or, Should Europe
Become Cossack? A Warning to the
German People. The ol her. was writ
ten by a young and very talented
banking employe In Berlin, H. Levy,
who did not reveal his identity and
later on disappeared from the party.
Its title was: Concerning the Oriental
Question, or, Should the Socialist La- :
bor Party Become Turkish? A Warn
ing to the German Socialdemocracy.
"These differences were renewed,
when in 1896 and ISII7 Turkey was
Involved in conflicts with the Arme

The Turkish side was again taken by

EVERETT, WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JAN, 18, 1918.

(WRITTEN ESPECIALLY FOR THE NORTHWEST WORKER)
Hernstein, Kosa Luxemburg and my
self ....
"Thus we have had hardly one war,
thai did not challenge Socialists to
take sides, HonietlmeH passionately,
for one or the other belligerent party,
i and that did not roveal sharp differ
ences of opinion among us. Nobody
would have claimed that such parti
sanship was a violation of the rulen
of International solidarity, or a sanc
tion of war In general."
KautHky then goes on to explain
that our tactical problems In times of
peace differ from our International
problems in war. While the war will
be fought in the intereHt of ruling
classes on both sldfiß, the working
clas:: is nevertheless interested in the
outcome, because the victory of one
nation's ruling class may considerably
Improve or deteriorate the conditions
of the working class In the other na
tion. "For this reason we must take
sides in such wars, even though we
condemn war in general. As to what
side we should support, that is a prob
, lew which war presents to Socialists.
This question of partisanship is our
real problem, not the question of the
military tactics employed by the bel
ligerent leaders."
Kautsky then explains that such na
tional partisanship of Socialists in a
war differs from the nationalism of
the ruling class, who believe in nation
alist view under all circumstances,
whereas the national partisanship of
the Socialists is dictated by the prob
able international advantages or in
juries which vk;lory'V>; defeat of this
or that nation may bring to the work
: ing classes.
DIFFICULT QUESTION
"This implies that internationalists
may thereby arrive at vastly differ
ent views, according to the varying
facts upon which they make their
decisions. The Socialist parties of
different nations may adopt conflict
ing views, and so may the Socialists
within tinl same nation."
Such a situation will necessarily
threaten to split the International
unity of Hi" Socialist movement. But
this cannot lie helped. It is nil the
more difficult Tor Socialists to de
cide themselves under such condi
tions, as the class struggle principle,
which !;uiili s us in our work in peace
[ful times, cannot advise us in such
problems,
"in times of peace, tin- natural at
titude (if the Socialdemocracy as the
representative of the lowest strata of
the nation is thai of opposition to ev

cured the strength to take hold of the

ing to support a government as soon

ULONSKA TO SPEAK
IN SEATTLE SUNDAY
AT STEVENS HALL
The regular Sunday evening meet
ing in Stevens Hall, S'.itlle, will be
addressed by Comrade Carl Ulonska,
Secretary of the Bnohomish county
organization, well known throughout
(he slate of Washington tor his very
[able work as organizer and propa
) itmliht. Previous to the lecture,
some matters of great importance to
King county Socialists will he dis
cussed, in mass meeting.
Comrade Shipley's four lectures in
the "Nebula to Man" series were so
well received that the course will
be given again with the coming of
spring. Seventeen subs for The
Northwest Worker were captured by
Shiipley at las; Sunday's meeting.
• that our old tactics was wrong. Both
views are mistaken."
, I am quoting Kautßky, not because
i I subscribe to every word he says,
, but because he Is the leading Marx
i lan of the Socialist movement of the
• world today, and because he repre
sents In the largo average the typi
• cal views of Marx and Engels. The
i (act that he sometimes differed from
■them In special questions merely
'proves how difficult it is to get all
the essential facts In such problems
arranged In such a way that all can
agree.
It is evident, then, that Kautsky
realizes as clearly as Marx and En
gels did that we have only a choice
of the lesser evil In such situations,
. and that we get nowhere by a mere
proclamation of the absolute inviol
ability of Internationalism. We must
study the situation from all sides,
calculate the most probable outcome
of the war and its presumable effects
on the national and international de
velopment of the working classes,
and take our stand accordingly. This
choice of the smallest probable evil
will always involve us in conflicts
with our class-struggle attitude and
with our international unity.
Kautsky admits that national par
tisanship in war carries the danger
of international division in its train,
but he contends that such partisan
ship is very well compatible with our
international principle, so long as we
are moved by considerations of gen
eral working class interests. The
main question for us, In such a situ
ation, is, in Kautsky's opinion:
I "Whose victory offers the best pros
pects for our cause, not only in our
own state, but in the world? No mat
ter what may be the answer, it never
can violate the principles of interna
tionalism which rests upon the idea
that the interests of the proletariat
of one country are identical witn
; those of the proletariat in another
country, that the proletariat cannot
gain any permanent progress in one
country, if it goes backward in an
other. But international solidarity
does not mean that the answer must
be the same everywhere. On the
contrary, a unanimous decision of the
I Soelaldemocracy in case of a war has
very rarely been secured so far."
KAUTSKY'S PREDICAMENT
Here we meet with a peculiarity
of Kuutsky which he shares with
Marx and Engels. lie gets tangled
up In his own statements. In one
place he says that the victory or de
feat of a certain nation may signify
an advantage or an injury for the
working class of the defeated nation.
In another he says that the working
class of one nation cannot gain any
permanent progress, if the working
class of another nation is set back.
Right hero is the crux of the whole
question, and right here he fails to
give a convincing reply to the prob
lem. 'His convincing reply has nev
er been given in any of the Socialist
discussions of the war problem.
Granted that the labor movement
of the different countries is so inter
; woven that we cannot make progress
toward practical internationalism so
long as the working class of certain

Now perhaps we shall soon hear of
