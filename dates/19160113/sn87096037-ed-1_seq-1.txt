Electric service helps a city advance in industry
and especially so if it is a twenty*four hour service.
Now that twenty-four hour service is your
good fortune the electric washing machine and
electric iron can be enjoyed.
Electric Irons and Electric Washers are as es
sential to the home as the plow is to th? farm.
Give your wife a square deal and let her have
some of the comforts that can now be enjoyed by
the all day and all night electric service.
