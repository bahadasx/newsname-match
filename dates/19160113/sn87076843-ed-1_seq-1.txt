Collier's Weekly has the follow
ing editorial in the current issue in
refernce to a suggestion by a
Lucas county appellate judge :
"An able lawyer and thoughtful
man is the Hon. Reynolds R. Kin
kade of the Ohio court of appeals.
From him comes this suggestion:
'That the 'competency of a man to
mako a will be decided before his
death instead of afterward.'
"Concretely a man wanting to
make a will would go before a
judicial tribunal say the usual
probate court which should take
bvideircc as to his competency and
make findings which should be for
ever binding.
"This would do away with the
expensive and tedious lawsuits
which occur sometimes a score of
years after the will is made and
at a time when the best possible
evidence namely, the maker of the
will, has long been under the
ground. The certifications of this
judicial tribunal would be final.
"Is there not in this a complete
analogy to those proceedings of
public officials which validate cer
tain bond issues and so certify the
bonds? Certainly this is a sugges
tion worthy of discussion on the
part of lawyers."
Judge Kinkadc is well known in
Wood county, and it was this same
judge whose decision rendered in
Wood County Circuit Court was
the first to be made (and still
stands) defining what is a news
paper and his Honor's decision
has made history that sounds good
to the newspaper publisher whose
desire to exist had long been de
nied by that class of publications
that claimed to own the world be
cause they "saw it first."

Suggestions Offered by Extension
Department State University.
Are you thinking of removcling
or repairing any of the buildings
on your farm next spring? If so
write to the Extension Depart
ment, Ohio State University, Co
lumbus, Ohio, for stock plans of
barns, houses, poultry houses, corn
cribs, dairy barns, etc. These
plans represent the latest ideas in
farm building construction and
are designed to provide the facili
ties at an economical cost. If spe
cial plans are desired blue prints
covering the construction will be
made by the department at cost.
If extensive planning is desired a
specialist on farm buildings will be
sent to outline the work and offer
practical suggestions. No cost is
attached to this service.
"Fowls will keep themselves free
from vermin during the winter
months if given a convenient place
to dust," says M J. Killpatrick,
poultry expert, Ohio State Univer
sity extension service. "A box 30
inches square and 12 inches deep
may be built in one corner of the
pen, or such a box may be made
with legs so as to raise 'it 16 inches
off of the floor. Almost any fine
dry powder will make good dust
ing material. The particles should
be fine enough so that they will
choke up the breathing pores of
the parasites which live on the
fowl's body. .Equal parts of loam,
sand arid sifted coal ashes, to
which has been added a little kero
sene oil and the whole thoroughly
mixed is often used for the dust."
Farmers need not lay up their
automobiles for the winter because
of danger of freezing up the
engine, says Frederick W. Ives of
the agricultural engineering de-
partment, Ohio State University

PROTECT THE ROADS.
Township Trustees Will Enforce
Laws Prohibiting Cutting
Through Roads.
The Perrysburg township trus
tees have received numerous com
plaints concerning the manner in
which the roads have been cut up
by farmers and others who have
laid tile under the roadbed for
drainage purposes and have not
properly replaced the roadbed,
thus injuring the road and in
many cases leaving obstructions
which are dangerous to travel.
The trustees give timely warn-
ing by advertisement in another
column and announce that they
will enforce the law in every case.
In this, the trustees are to be
greatly commended.
