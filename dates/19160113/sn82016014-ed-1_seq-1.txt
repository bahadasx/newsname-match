"The article printed in the State

obtaining a Chicago department of the

members of the Commercial club, he
called upon J. E. Gorman, chief ex
ecutive officer, and A- C. RidgTvay,
chief operating officer.
"We were assured that the Rock
Island Intends to make a change that
will be of great benefit to Topeka buc
the officials did not care to tell us at
this time juat what department they
contemplate sending nere," said Presi
dent Elliott. "While it is like all
plans, liable to failure, I believe the
Rock Island officials really have un
der consideration a project that will
benefit Topeka.
"Revelation of their plans at this
time, they pointed out, mighl cause
trouble.
"From remarks made by them I
have drawn the conclusion that a ma
jority of the employees the road con
templates sending here will not be as
high salaried men as those we lost in
the moving of the operating depart
ment of the second district. However,
it may be that the new department
will have more employees. I never

In a temperature of fifteen below
zero a large part of Topeka's fire
fighting force struggled for four hours
early this morning with a stubborn
fire which almost completely destroyed
the nwly equipped and newly-opened
Cremerie restaurant at 724 and 726
Kansas avenue. In spite of the fact
that both day and night forces were
on the job and the further fact that
there was no delay in reaching the
fire the total loss incident to the fire
will x-un near $25,000.
The Cremerie, which was the prop
erty of Fred Roes and Wood Fowler,
was installed only a few months ago
at a cost of $16,000. The loss is esti
mated at $10,000 and Fred Hoss stated
this morning that it is half covered
by
insurance. The insurance was
written by the firm of Faulkner

$10,000, is carried by Stephenson &

the loss was fully covered by insur

Delayed Telephone Call Hard
on Kansas Doctor.
Washington County Physician
Complains to Topeka.
BARNES CASE SAD ONE, MATES!
Stork Was Hovering Over As
Bell Rang- Frantically.
Then a Competitor Came Along
and Did the Work.
Because a telephone girl caused him
to miss a call of the stork, a Barnes
physician has written to the utilities
commission asking that they take ac
tion. Failure to receive a hurry call
from the stork caused the doctor to
lose a patient also a $15 fee.
In a lengthy complaint to the state
commission today, the Washington
county physician protests against the
cruel and heartless methods of tele
phone operators. Of course the tele
phone girl handled the call all riprht,
but the doctor wasn't at home. Now
the physician is peeved because the
girl didn't call the chauffeur or the of
fice boy or the maid or the nurse and
tell them all about it.
Here's How It Happened.
A visit from the stork was expected
in a rural home in Washington county
a few nights ago. xne larmer caiiea
for the doctor and nearly tore the
instrument from the wall when he did
n't get prompt connections. Then he
said harsh things about the medical
profession generally and called anoth
er physician. This time he had better
luck. The second choice doctor came
on the run.
In the meantime uoctor .-o. i was
answering a call. He returned home
to be advised that the telephone girl
had left word that someone on a par
ty line had called, but that connections
could not he made promptly and the
calling party hung up the receiver.
The next morning the doctor learn
ed that his competitor had received the
call and a J15 fee in a brand new baby
case. Dr. No. 1 was tilled with right
eous wrath and he swore vengeance on
the telephone company. So he sent his
complaint to Topeka.
Xo action has been taken by the
commission.
