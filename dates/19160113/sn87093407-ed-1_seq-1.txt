\\ \SI 11 X( i TON, Jan. 13 —President Wilson stands
squarely behind Secretary Lansing's statement that Ameri

While •icn. Carranza has been urged to round up the

President Wilson and the state department are awaiting

the chief has sent troops in pursuit.
Indications are that Carranza will seek to satisfy the

American mining companie-• are considering sending a

his bandits infesting the mining regions if Carranza will give
permission for such action, dispatches from El Paso said to

The first outbreak of indignation among officials and in
congress it unaltered.
The president, however, is giving no heed to inflammatory
suggestions fmm any quarter. No change of j>olicy in the

had been executed by a Vilhsta firing squad Friday in the
