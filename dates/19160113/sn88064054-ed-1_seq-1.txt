~IIITION and BARRET.
Nobibition and Lieut. Governor
Ocupied the remainder of i
the time ot the speaker He stated
that at a meeting of the Sate Lead
ers of Prohibition which was held
at Alexandria about six months
ago they was decided that it was
not the proper time to agitate stateI
wide prohibition. He stated that
the way to get state wide prohibi
tion was to keep working on the
Parish unit until it was assured
that the state would go dry and
then call an election.
With the House and Senate having
a majority of wets he stated that it
was possible for the law to be
passed calling an election and be so
construed that in case it was not
voted dry that all parishes would
become wet. Col. Pleasant then
stated that there were 80,000 to
90,000 wet votes in the state today
against 40,000 to 50,000 dry, which
proved that state wide prohibition
could not carry and the entire state
might go wet.
He stated that Jno. M. Parker
was laughing up his sleeve at the
injection of prohibition into the
resent campaign as it would mean
a split in the Democratic vote in
case the issue was bitterly fought
and result as it did in other states,
He told of the record of Lieut.
Gov. Barret on prohibition and
stated that he was an eleventh
hour, 59 minutes and 59 second
c'nvert. He read part of the fam
ous Warren Thomas letter and Mr.
Thomas was on the platform as
living evidence. He then produced
the advertisemnent which appeared
in a Labor Program which was
ordered and paid for by Mr. Barret
stating that he (Mr. Barret was a
local optionist. Mr. Pleasant stat
ed that he "cooperated with the
boys" in the same issue as Mr.
Barret had done.
The recent constitutional conven
tion fight was recalled when the
speaker told that the friends of dMr.
Barret were laughing at him, saying
that he was going into the political
junk pile and committing political
suicide by opposing the constitu
tional convention, but that when
the truth was brought to the rural
districts that they defeated the
convention.
SENATOR MOUTON A TREAT
Senator Mouton followed Col.
Pleasant and he kept the audience
in an uproar all the time, but inci
dently drove home some mighty
good reatons why he was entitled
to the majority of the votes of Bog
alusa eitizens. His opponent Fred
Claiborne was on the stage and he
went after Ferd in a friendly but
humorous manner. Mr. Claiborne
followed Mr. Mouton and stated his
claims in a good style. Following
the address of Mr. Claiborne Senator
Settoon, candidate f r re-election
made a short address.

HARRY THE TAILOR SLEEPS
WELL WHILE ROBBERS WORK
Anybody's hard luck story seems
like a joke to Harry Marchiz better
known as Harry the Tailor. Between
4 and 6 a m Tuesday morning rob
bers forced their way into the Mar
chiz home and took Harry's trousers
which contained $42.00. The rob
bers was evidently aware of the
fact that Harry had a good watch
and that was also taken. Entrance
was then gained to the store where
three suits of clothing, valued at
$55 was stolen. Mr. Marchiz states
that the fact he was up most of the
night on account of illness of his
wife is responsible for not being
awakened by the robbers when they
entered his room.
Another family reported that
robbers attempted to force their way
into a Columbia street home the
same night but were frightened
away.
The robbery was reported to the
police who are working on the case. I
No clue is suspected,.

JOHNSON CETTING
SPLENDID SUPPORT
'Washington Parish Can
didate Will Make
Splendid Senator
Several citizens of Franklinton
came over to Bogalusa Monday
night to attend the Pleasant meet
ing. Delos R. Johnson, who is a
candidate for the state senate, could
not be here on account of previous
engagements in Livingston Parish
where he went Monday. Mr. John'i
son is making an active canvass of
the district, and reports from all
points are very encouraging. A
meeting was held for him at Canaan,
in this parish, last week, where he
addressed a large crowd of the vot
ers of that community. He has
made speeches at several other
places in this parish, and also at
various points of the other parishes
of this district. He spent several
days in Bogalusa in the interest of
his candidacy a short time ago.
It is very pleasing to note that
the public men who come to Wash
ington Parish always have words of
praise for Representative Johnson,
which indicates his high standing
with the legislators of this state.
They know him by his good record
in the House of Representatives at
Baton Rouge, and they recognize
his ability.
Mr. Johnson is now seeking to be
promoted to the state senate, and
with his experience as a legislator
and personal acquaintance with the
members of the legislature and pub
lic affairs, he will be in position to
launch into active leadership in the
Isenate as he has done in the house
in the past few years. Efficient
service in the legislature does not
depend altogether upon a man's
ability to make a good speech on
the floor for or against propositions;
he can do much more if he is in
position to command important
committee assignments, and by his
personal influence and weight with
his colleagues. Johnson is a hard
worker for his countrymen, and is
well fitted to preform the duties of
a senator.
It will be well to remember that
this senatorial district is composed
of the Parishes of Washington, St.
Tammaniy, Tangipahoa, St. Helena
and Livingston, and is represented
in the state senate by two senators.
There are four candidates for these
two places. Delos R. Johnson is the
Sonly one in the race from this par
ish, and we expect to do ourself
proud by giving him our solid
support.
COLUMBIA STREET BUSINESS
DISTRICT WAS THREATENED
Work of the Columbia street fire
department early Wednesday
morning averted a costly tire on
Columbia street and their work
Isaved several retail establishments.
A high wind was blowing, and the
fire having a considerable headway
when the department arrived, they
fought the flames that looked as if
The Fair, the D. Beinn Furniture
Store and other places would be
Iburned. The fire destroyed three
houses be!onging to ReileyKing,
which was located at the rear of
Beinn Furniture Store. The origin
of the fire is unknown.
Revival leetinl
A series of evangelistic meetings
will begin in The First Baptist
Church, Sunday, January 16th, at
11 o'clock a. m, Rev. C.E. Perry
man. D.D., who will assist in these
services will be here Sunday and
preach both morning and night.
Everybody is cordially invited to

Sister And Brother Of Mut]
ton D)uBoise Go To
Mississippi
Was Mutton DuBoise, the 16 year
old Bogalusa youth knocked from a
car by emplYes of the M and V
railroad which resulted in his death
last Wednesday evening? Reports
have reached Bogalusa that the
youth was not killed by his own
negligence while riding the cars but
that some one on the train threaten
ed to strike him or did strike him
and that as he fell a pair of trucks
passed over his body which resulted
in death. J. N. DuBoise, residing
at 834 Ave. D, left Monday and his
sister, Mrs. E. A. Holmes left for
the scene of the accident yester
day. They will make a thorough
investigation of the report and if it
is found their brother was forced or
knocked from the train they will see
that the party is brought to justice,
Mutton DuBoise left Bogalusa
about three months ago and secured
work in Mississippi. On Wednesday
he started for Bogalusa and met an
untimely death. The remains ar
rived in Bogalusa Friday and funeral
services was held Saturday, burial
was in the Magee Cemetery.
J. N. DuBoise and Mrs. E. A.
Holmes desire to express their heart
felt thanks to friends and neighbors
who so kindly assisted them in their
hours of grief
DBOCALLUSA HAS 851-OTERS
WHICH IS 1A B1I INCREAISE
That Bogalusa is rapidly gaining
in population and that the class of
citizens who compose the Magic
City are not the driftless kind is best
demonstrated by the fact that there
are 857 qualified voters within the
city limits which is a healthy in-:
crease over past years. Besides this
number of voters there are a large
number who have paid their poll
tax for the past year but will not be
able to vote until the election next.
