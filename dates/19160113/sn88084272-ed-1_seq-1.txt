Report Says He Was Cap
tured By Americans and
Mexicans at Madera.
MAY BE RUSE TO
PREVENT A PANIC
Communication with Madera
Has Been Cut Off, Mak
ing News Difficult.
GRAVE doubt Is cast upon the re
port of the capture of Rodriguez,
the bandit leader, at Madera:
VBome local observers of the. situation
n.feel confident that the story is started
' by Carrancistas jn the effort to allay
excitement, and that it is not true
Attention is called to the -fact that
all communication -with Madera has
been cut off for some time, and it is
cuusiuerea strange mat tne wires are
suddenly restored to carry this story.
The story that Americans made the
capture is discredited, since the num
ber of Americans in and around Ma
dera is small, and not many of those
known to be in that vicinity are be
lieved to be of a sort to undertake to
tapture bandits.
If Carranza soldiers made the cap
ture, as stated in Mexico, the question
arises why Rodriguez and bis band
made a trip of more than 10 miles
from the scene of the massacre to
Madera in order to attack a garrisoned
teffo with nominally equal -nam bers.
Thre are too many points in doubt to
allow -the story to be taken very seri
ously until it is fully confirmed from
reliable sources.
Tie Rodriguez Story.
Jose Rodriguez, the man held re
sponsible for the massacre of IS Amer
icans at Santa Ysabel. western Chi
huahua, Monday past, was reported
captured at Madera Thursday morning
by a combined force of Hearst ranch
men and citizens, under the leadership
of Maximiano Marquez. old time fore
man at -the Bablcoro, properties.
Call for Reinforcement.
The message telling of the capture
of Rodriguez was received by the
Mexico Noith Western officials In El
Pasu sent up by Madera agent of the
line, Herrera. One hundred and twenty
five men constituted the force which
fourbt Rodriguez's band, and captured
the bandit, according to the dispatches
ifr eived here Thursday noon.
Another report in El Paso, uncon
'.rmed at noon, but persistent in well
advised circles, declared that Rodri
guez had played a trick and had
started for the big mining district of
Parral, literally Infested with rich
mines and under operation by the Al
tarado and other American interests,
employing scores of Americans In the
management and operation of plants.

Andres G. Garcia here was appealed
to by Mr. Cobb, and promise of efforts
to stir up something of a reinforce
ment nature out of the military au
thorities was promised.
The wire over which came the mes
sage reporting the capture of Rodri

previously at Pearson. Instead of bro

President Wilson and secretary of
state Lansing today looked to Gen.
Ca.Tana for prompt compliance with
the demand of the United States gov

for the punishment of the Mexican
bandits.
While anxiously awaiting Carranza's
response, the American officials con
tinued their efforts to obtain all th
facts bearing on the murders from
consular officers In Mexico and along
the border.
Could Attack he Foreseen?
Officials particularly wanted to know
whether the murders were due to the
failure of the de facto government of
Mexico to afford proper protection in a
zone known oy it to be dangerous or
whether the men lost their lives as the
result of a bandit attack which could
not have been foreseen.
Xo Further Action In Sight.
The latest Mexican outrages con
