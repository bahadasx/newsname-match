THUG BRUTALLY BEATS DOWN WOMAN
BOIL YOUR WATER
Fearing the possibility of a ty
phoid epidemic in Tacoma, with
the freezing up of the purifica-
tion plant ut the head of the
« • Green river water system, City
Health Officer Wall today issued
a warning to all citizens to boil
all water they me.
The purification plant on Green
river, where chlorine ga« is in
jected into Iho water for Tacoma
use, has been completely frozen
up for two da.VH in zero weather
accompanied by a 60-mile Kale.
. Workmen who went up yester
day to try to put the plant Into
operation reported it will be Im
possible until » thaw comes.
To Hamlet or Ham It?
That Is the Question
BY THE SCHOOL EDITOR
To Hamlet or not to "ham" it is the question that is most troubling
the seniors of Lincoln Park high school today.
This is the season of the year whsn all high school seniors are agog
with the selection of a proper class play. The Lincoln Park upperclass
men are aggoging with the rest.
But at Lincoln the youthful actors are meeting snags and the usual
joy of selecting the big production is missing.
All English departments in high schools are emblematic of the artis
tic, the best that there is in life. Through the English department the
plastic student is made to appreciate the really worth-while in literature.
He is stuffed with Shakespeare, Dante, Emerson, Macauley and the doz
en and one other ancient best sellers. Hence his natural rise to literary
genius. r
In all high school English departments are to be found the teachers
who dote on nothing but Shakespeare's plays. Lincoln has some of these.
They can see nothing but utter ruin to the students if a comedy, other than
William's, is attempted. The students realize that only the very best pro
fessional companies can produce Shakespeare without unwittingly bur
lesquing it. So they are facing today the double tragedy of producing
Hamlet, and they are kioking. They want something lighter and a few
centuries more modern.
# * # #
Unless you have been a high school senior or have seen one of these
plays, it is impossible to understand the deep blue pall that is hovering
over the south side institution.
Hamming Hamlet always will be a popular pastime in the eyes of high
school teachers; so the best you kids can do, (if you don't want to go on
shouting soliloquies in school and doing your Diamond Dicking in after
life) is to keep on kicking— and be kept in after school.
