HOW CITIES AND STATES I
HANDLE LIQUOR TRAFFIC
Prohibition by 9tate law pre-'
vails in 17 cities of 30,000 and ;
over?4 each in Georgia and!
Tennessee, 3 in Kansas, 2 each!
in Oklahoma and West Virginia, 1
and 1 each in Maine and North
r* ii ? .....
Carolina. Municipal pronibition j
is in effect in 15 cities?8 in |
Massachusetts, 2 each in Illinois j
and California, and 1 each in j
Pennsylvania, Iowa and Wash-1
ington. County prohibition has J
closed the saloons in 2 Michigan 1
cities and parish prohibition has
closed them in 1 Louisiana city.
There are thus 35 cities in which
total prohibition prevails. In
addition, there are 8?4 in Ohio,
2 in Colorado, and 1 each in
Pennsylvania and Illinois ?in
which partial prohibition is in
effect through the operation of
wuut is Known as tne district" I
system, under which certain
districts or sections of the city
may by popular vote, abolish j
their saloons, while other sec- J
tions retain them.
The largest city which has
adopted prohibition independently
of state or county action in
the matter is Cambridge, Mass.,
whose population is estimated at
110,000. The largest city in
which the saloons have been
closed by state enactment is
Atlanta, Ga., with approximately
180,000 inhabitants.
In 124 of the 169 cities in
which saloons are licensed, they
are limited as to number, and in
91 as to location; and in28cities,
16 of which are in Pennsylvania,
there are no restrictions as to
either number or location. In
some cities the limitation as to
number is definitely stated; in
others it takes the form of a provision
to the effect that the
number of saloons shall not
exceed 1 to every 250, 500, 750,
1,000, 3,000 or 5,000 inhabitants.
The 250-inhabitant limit is em
ployed in the five Wisconsin
cities of Milwaukee, Racine,
Superior, Oshkosh and La Crosse;
and the 5,000-inhabitant limit
prevails in Chicago and Danville,

TALKING OF NEW SITE F
FOR IVY'S MILL BRIDGE
The last issue of the Rock Hill
Record carried the following c
jommunication, signed "Fair f
Play," which will be read with h
nterest by the people of Fort p
Mill and the township: v
We hear a good deal of dis- ^
Mission on the matter of moving

toctinn tn Pnffltn"'" L i
vuiKiviii c? i-crry, ueiow p
Catawba, and what Lancaster
will do, etc. We hope that if ^
inything further is done on a v
matter of this kind in which p
Lancaster is interested that it ^
will be put in a business shape. r
so that Lancaster will not be
allowed to hand York another c
ieal like she did at the River c
Bend bridge. We do not know jc
what advantages could or would p
be derived from a bridge at j p
Cureton's Ferry or thereabouts.
It is stated by Engineer Miller
that it wiil cost at least $(>.000
to move the River Bend bridge
to the other location. If I.an
caster is to be depended o i to

come up lacking-, as we under- c
stand that county is very heavily i
involved. As stated above, we j
know nothing of the merits of
of the case and are not in po- "
sition at this time to express an ;1
opinion on it, hut we do know of 1
a proposition that was put to i
the writer some time ago that I
in our mind is a fine thing for
both Rock Hill and Fort Mill and r
other communities above Fort (
Mill, where its citizens want to c
visit Rock Hill and York, and s
that is for a bridge to be put a
between Fort Mill and Rock Hill r
at the end of J. M. Cherry's
road on the Catawba. At the r
time this matter was discussed I
a prominent F^rt Mill citizen t

this bridge could be had he was f

our men were shot to death, a

Cherry would agree to the use

he will) there would be no

As the county has to begin a
