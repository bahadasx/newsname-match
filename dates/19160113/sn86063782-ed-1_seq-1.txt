BRITISH WITHDRAWAL.
Quitting (jallipoli Unparalleled Feat,
Savs Premier.
"The evacuation of the Gallipoli
peninsula lias no parallel in military
or naval history." declared Premier
Asquith in commons. ''The retirement
was effected without the loss of a
sinple life.
"Kinp George has heen advised to
pive especial recognition to the generals.
admirals and other officials concerned
in the successful movement of
troops from the Ihirdanelles."
The premier said it was undesirable
to discuss the report of General Sir
Tan Hamilton, former commander at
the Ihirdutiellcs. at present.
20,000 Teutons Taken by Russia.
in the two weeks' battle that eul.
ruinated in the capture of Czartory.sk
and the driving of all Austro-German
forces from the east bank of Strypa
river, the Teuton losses totaled at
least 00.000 men, aceordinp to official
estimates made at Petrograd. Official
reports to the war office state that tin
Russians have taken more than 120..
000 orisoners. and that twice that
number of Austro-fiermau sold ion
have been killed or wounded.
Heights Held by Russians.
The Russians retain the important
strategic heights in the neighborhood
of Sadaglra. north of Ozernowitz. Bukowiiia,

Sweep Waters For .Mines.
Mine-sweeping operations 011 a vast

destruction of the British battleship
King I!ilward VII, presumably by a
mine planted by a Herman submarine.
Although all tlie no-tubers of the ship's

of the King lldward VII is a serious
