WHEN THE NEW
YEAR ARRIVES.
At certain periods of the year there
are certain diseases that sweep the
country. In the spring influenza afflicts
mankind; in the summer, rose fever.
mid in the early autumn the hav
everites snullle and mangle the
English languuge. But with the bei
ginning of the year un epidemic of a
disease of the most virulent sort spreads
o.rer the civilized world, causing ninety
nine out of a hundred of its inhabitants
to raise their right hands involuntarily
and sweiir by all that's holy they will
Ituld fast to the straight and narrow
puth forever uid forever.
The sjinptoms of the diseaso are al
ways the same. It is better and more
neutrally known tliun the common
co'd; it is mot e regular in its appear
ance, and mure persons suirer from it
than from any other aliliction, yet
physicians and bacteriologists have
never found a remedy or isolated its
germ. This microbe, once taken into
the system, can never be eliminated.
The same victims suffer from it year
after year, and each year hundreds of
thousands of new sufferers join the
ranks,
Tho disease first makes its appear
ance in December. A victim beams
beatitically around a poker table and
announces, "Well, boys, I swear oil on
the 1st,"
Jan. 1 arrives. Simultaneously sev
eral hundred million persons rise,
yawn and glance at the calendar. In
voluntarily tho muscles of the right
arm contract, elevating that member
toward the ceiling. In a state of tem
porary (tupor the victim voices good
intentions. The stupor is attended by
either a lapse of memory or a distorted
mentality. ,
In from five minutes to one week,
statistics show, the disease usually runs
ita course. The victim becomes him
self again. He draws himself to his
full height, voices the thought, "Aw,
what's the use?" and resumes his nor
, mal mods of life with rsnswed ardor.
We have enrolled about 10 or 12 new
pupils in school since Christmas.
Quite a number of the children in the
school are confined to their homes With

The different teachers hold devotional
exercises, erch in her own room on

is out of school for few days, sick with

Miss Katheryne Parke, who has
charge of the 5th and 6th grades is de
tained from her school work because of
"Krip".
Tho boys and girls are quite busy In
getting ready for the midyear examina
tions, which begin on Wednesday of
next week.
Notwithstanding the unnsual amount
of sickness, and the inclemency of the
weather the school is startingoff splend
idly since the holidays.
Miss Mary Elmore, who has been
unable to meet her classes since the
holidays, because of sickness, is better
and hopes to resume her teaching in
few days.
Miss Lena Webb, who had charge of
the department ot music 1914-15, has
returned and again assumed control of
the same department; she begins again
with quite a large and enthusiastic
class.

The Board ofEducation has recently
supplied the school with a splendid col
lection of helpful wall Atlases; they
have also bought for the school window
protectors or guards for ail the rooms
of the basement; and window shades
have been bought for the rooms not
originally supplied with them. All
these supplies-were much needed and
will enable the school to do better work.
MILITARY TRAINING CAMP.
General Leonard Wood, of the U. S.
Army has juat made the following an
nouncement: .
(t has been decided to hold a military
training camp for civilians at Fort
Oglethorpe, Ga., near Chattanooga,
Tenn. While many other localities of
fered excellent camp sites and most
genereusly promised to secure every
necessary convenience, the necessity
for being near a garrisoned army po.t
was paramount. The necessary camp
equipment and supplies are at hand
with storage facilities; the regular
troops can be more easily maintained
and at less expense; water and light
are under Government control and there
is well equipped target range within
reach.
The climate is excellent, weather
conditions most favorable for out of
door work and offers unquestionably a
healthy location in addition to being
the only large army post now garrison
ed in the region to be covered.
This camp will be conducted by the
War Department along the lines of the
Plattsburg Camp for "Students" and
for "Business and Professional men".
held last summer.
The first camp for business and pro
fessional men will begin early in April
and continue four weeks. If applica
tions warrant, a second camp will be
held early in May to terminate in June.
The students camp will open July 6th,
for five weeks. Thereafter, if condi
tions warrant tho camp will be con
tinued. For details and complete in
formation a bulletin will be distributed
from these headquarters by application
to the "Officer in Charge. Southern
Training Camp, Governors Island.N. Y.
Camp expense about $20.00 exclusive
of uniform, which costs from $8.00 tu
$12.00. Special rates of one and a half
cents per mile for round tiip fare are
otlered by railroads covering this region.
The camp will be under the direct
supervision of the Commanding Gen
eral. Eustern Dopartmept, commanded
by selected olllcers of -the regular army.
An extensivu course of trcining will bu
given.
INSTRUCTION.
The purpose of the camp will be to
give each attendant as much of the"
fundamental education of an officer as
can be imparted in the durution of the
camp. A certain definite routine will
be prescribed for all, including rifle
practice. Special opportunities under
expert officers will be offered for train
ing in various branches of the service,
cavalry, artillery, engineers, signal
corps and first aid. There will be
present at the camp Cavalry, Artillery,
Signal Corps and infantry officers of
tho regular army.
ORGANIZATION.
Attendants at the camp will be divid
ed into war strength, companies of in
fantry, troops of cavalry or batteries
of Artillery (if application warrant)
commanded by officer, of the regular
army, whose duties cover not only those
of instruction but also the health and
general welfare of their commands.
Attendant, are on a cadst basis.
