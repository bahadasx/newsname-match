Delay in transportation of the

I.nto today the bodies bad not left the

trains had come north during the day.
Arrangements had been made for the
transmission of the bodies upon ar

Xo Public Funeral. '
As the day progressed plans for n
public funeral of all the victims wore
abandoned since many relatives from
various parts of the I'nited States
claimed the victims.
Thomas I!. Holmes, the sole foreign
survivor of the massacre, reached the
border here about noon in a state of
nervous and almost mental collapse.
He refused to discuss the massacre
and hurried to his home where he was
protected by his family from visitors.
A compilation of stories he had told
to fellow pnssetigers on the train and
to mining men in Chihuahua nnd as
gathered by officials of the American
.Smelting and Heflnlng company, fol
lows in brief. It Is understood that
detailed statement will be filed to the
; state, department about 7 o'clock this
evening.
Track Torn l' Ahead.
The train reached Santa Ysabel,

miles, and in cross! ng a small deep

! protection of a small bush and then
I wormed his way out of the massacre,
whl"h was continuing io b'n rear,
statement by Holmes.
The following is the detailed state
niont of Mr. Holmes, as given to the
state department and press tonight:
"Our train left Chihuahua City
Jlonday morning, January 10, at about
It o'clock. Tri'in was stopped at. or
about the ranch llaeza, a point about
fivy miles west of Santa Ysabel be
tween 1:30 and 2 o'clock that after
noon. While the train was standing
at station of Santa Ysab'l two armed
Mexicans had ridden by, and studied
the train. The Mexican passengers at
me afterward that
the riders had inquired if there were
any soldiers on the train.
At the iioint of tho-massacre ouri
train was stopped in a cut. so that the
last car was just inside of tho cut.
We were stopped by another train,
the front trucks of one of tho coal
cars of which was se n to be off the
track. This v ns tho first we knew of
a train being ahead of us. There was
nobody standing, or to bp seen around
the iron? train. It was evidently
nlnced there to slot) and block our
train. When our train was stopped,
Newman and I Were sitting together
and Hvatis came up and was looking
out of our window. Evans, Newman,
! MacHation and I wre the ilst to gei
off tho train, stepping off of the right!
hand side. Watson was either get
jting off or about to do so, behind us,
t when I looked back and saw him. -!
Hears Volley Flml.
Just after alighting 1 heard a vol-
im,1 oi rifle shots from a. point on the
other side of the cut and idst above
tho train. Looking around, I could
a bunch of about twelve or fifteen
men standing In a solid line, shoulder
to shoulder, and shooting directly at
jus. These bandits were between fifty
and seventy-five feet from us. The
! back end of the coach rut off my view
so I could not see how many bandits
there were. The back steps

depth of the cut on the river side at
that point waa about, twelve feet, tin
the other side of the bank it was
much higher. The Santa Ysabel river
lay beyond. To the back of the train
was a railroad embankment that had
a decline from the track toward the
river.

London, Jan, 12. CeltinJc, the
capital of Montenegro, now seems
I iiKciy to suiter the same late or ine
Pelgrade and British observers are
already asking anxiously what men
nee the corniest of Montenegro is
, likely to hold over the allies at Sa
loniki. Fighting is going on all around
C'ettinje, the smnll town, which near
ly a year ago ceased to be the seat
j of the Montenegrin government. Nev
l er before in the long history of the
little Montenegrin kingdom has , it
been compelled to bow to a foreign
eonnuerur, but there seems little hope
that It can long withstand Jhe over
whelming strength of Ceneral Koevcs
in men and munitions.
(Jirt Advantage to Austria.
As in Serbia's case, the entente
press finds it inexplicable why Ital
ian assistance was not sent long ago
to Lovcen, which, It Is said could
have been rendered Impregnable with
:v comparatively small force and
some heavy guns. The reduction of
Montenegro, the press points out,
will enable Austria not only to en
ter the Adriatic but also threaten the
flank of any advance from .Salonlki
and prevent any effective move by
the entente forces through Albania.
Serious for Italy.
For Italy the new Austrian success
has a most serious aspect. The long,
narrow Italian peninsula is peculiar
ly vulnerable to attack from the sea.
Any really great Austrian naval base
In the magnificent harbor of Cattaro
would have been impossible without
Lovcen, but under the new circum
stances Austrian possession of Cat
taro is almost as great, a menace to
Italy as the Herman corniest of Ca
lais would have been to Groat Britain.
While attention is centered on the
developments on the Adriatic, coast,
it is announced from Home that two
Italian transports, the Brindisi and
Citta di Palermo, last week struck
j mines and sank. A majority of the
j crews were saved.
IJcncwcd Hussiun Attacks.
On the Itusslan front the Austrian
official communication records renew
ed desperate, attacks by the Hussions
on the IJessarabian frontier but insists
that the attacks everywhere were re
pulsed, Tho Petrograd communica
tion Is silent on the subject, but the
Russians usually withhold mention of
their movements until they are well
on the road to completion.
There have been no important de
velopments on the western front. The
blowing up of a largo Oerman muni
tlon depot near Lille is admitted in
tho German communication. Accord
ing to one account, this was duo to a
British air raid.
Much Damage Probable.
The English press believes that the
cautious wording of the German com
munieation conceals a disaster of
large proportions. There Is a great
spirit of optimism in both British and
French dispatches from. the western
front, tho correspondents expressing
the firm conviction of the allied gen
nils that there can be no possibility
of any successful German offensive
anywhere in the western lines.
Tho correspondent of Iteuter's sends
from British headquarters an Inter
view with an unnamed prominent
staff officer who was quoted as wiv
ing: Germans Outnumbered.
"We now have full information
about the German forces facing us.
We know their exact dispositions and
strength. We everywhere outnumber
tho Germans and also outnumber
them in both field and heavy artillery
and our positions are better than
theirs. We can fire five shells to their
one without depleting our munitions.
We can take their first line trenches
whenever we wish.
"To say that we have got them
Ixaten is dangerous rubbish, but the
truth Is we have them ready for heat

No place yet has
been selected for

being considered. According to Bic
kard all seats will be reserved and
prices will probably range from $10
up to $100 or more for ringside boxes.

promoters from either Hie local or
state authorities since ten-round no
decision bouts are permitted under
the New York state laws upon a pay

not going to manage tho proposed

financial backing for McCracken.
"Since I came here this winter,"
Itickard naid, "I huvn attended a
number of sporting events and have
noticed that there is unlimited gat"
money for anything out of the ordin
ary in the way of sport contests. I
told McCracken I thought a bout be
tween Willard and Moran would be
a big money-maker and he said he
would undertake to bring the men
together if t would supply the capi

some money, 1 agreed.
"If the W'illard-Mnran bout is a
financial success, I will offer a large
purse for n championship wrestling
match between Frank Gotch and Joe'

Itickard has been noted for his pro.

made and lost several fortunes. His I

Matter fost Scrloiw.
"My record during this controversy
will show," said Senator Oalllnger,
"that I have carefully refrained from
criticizing the Rovernment or from
making special pleas to protect liven
and property in Mexico. I have rea
lized the difficulty confronting th
administration and have no disposi
tion to cinbnrruss it simply because
it Is not of niy own party. But here
I Is a very seiioun majter confronting
I us." ,' j

Sherman's Bi-Milutlon.
Senator Sherman's resolution read.1
as follows:
"Whereas, Mexico Is now and has
for several years been rent with civil
strife which, in (lie absence of any
government able adequately to pro
tect life and property, has degener
ated Into a. condition of murder, ra
pine and pillage, resulting in the loss
of lives of American citizens ag well
11s Kuropeinis thero and the destruc
tion of their property; and,
"Whereas, Many such outrages
have been committed by the armed
forces of some one or more of the.
alleged revolutionary leaders, whose
warfare and followers are a msthod
of brigandage perpetrated by bandits,
and,
"Whereas, Conditions since the ren
ognltlon of Carranra, one of the al-
I leged revolutionary leaders, show no
1 improvement, nor does his govern
ment, manliest any tendency or suffi
cient strength to restore order or
maintain civil government adequate to
the protection of life and property;
.'in, I,
The Monroe )H tiinc.
' Whereas, this government has pro
mulgate. and still adheres, so far as
known, to what Is commonly called
the Monroe doctrine, under which tho
governments of the old world are lire
vented from the protection of their
own citizens or subjects by armed
forces, and such foreign governments
being so barred from the protection
of their citizens or subjects because
of the attitude of the t'nlted States
on the Monroe doctrine, thereby ren
der, it is alleged, the I'nited States re
sponsible for the loss of life or prop
erty resulting fnoii conditions In Mex
ico, and such claim, whether well
founded or not. Is of an arbitrary
character which may subject us to
arbitration before some tribunal on
the iiie.-t ion of damages; and,
'Whereas, icieh civil strife in north
ern Mexico has endangered the life,
limb and property of th,. people of
border stales of thin country, and con
dition,! have now reached the stage
110 longer tolerable to the peace and
good order of the border states of this
