Enterprise Association)
When I sailed from New York in
. late September I had a foolish notion
, that it took eight days to reach the
war .zone. That is what the steam
ship agent told me. But when New
York faded away and the straight
horizon of the sea surrounded us I
discovered that the zone of war was
wider than shown on the map, and
the minute a man steps onto a bel
ligerent nation's 'ship he comes into
this sphere of war. For the biggest
part of the' war the real wild beast
of war travels far and needs jio
road.
His name is hate.
He travels in the mails and on the
printing press and on men's tongues.
He was on that ship. The first day
out Hate stalked about the deck. He
was in the conversations and he
twisted men's tongues until they said
things that, those men would never
say except under the rule of organ
ized, carefully cultivated, cowardly
Hate.
Jt wasa shipload of Hate. Hata;
