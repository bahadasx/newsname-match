HERE ! ! I don't care what
serial you have seen, I don't care
what you might hear, about any
other serial, the Black Box has
anything produced to date sim
ply backed off the boards. ou
talk- about mystery, you talk
about stunts to hold you spell
bound, you talk about thrills, and
wonder stuff-1 want to tell you
franklv that the Black Box is so
vastly mostifyiug, so absolutely
and unusually different, that it
will hold you in a vice hive grip
for 15 consecutive weeks, written
by E. Phillips Oppenheim.
The Last
IP
nJI
Monte Carlo" says that the work of E. Phillips
Oppenheim improves steadily as the years roll on;
and that his stories are as full of dramatic interest
as ever.
True, and his VERY LAST story is yet the best
of all. It has dramatic interest plus; it has in
dividuality; it is inventive, scientific, ingenious
SKILLFUL a story that will live as long as will
the name of the author itself.
This wonderful story is "THE BLACK BOX,"
a mystery tale told as only Oppenheim can tell it.
Plausible, yet seemingly beyond human compre
hension; sensational, yet profoundly dignified,
mysterious without a hint of cheap "blood and
thunder."
THE BLACK BOX is full of action-gripping,
soul stirring, thrilling something doing in every
line never prosaic, never commonplace, never
dull. Being written by E. Phillips Oppenheim
it necessarily follows that the plot is original, that
the situations are exciting, the denouement in
tensely dramatic.
And so "the last is the best of all the game," and as noth
ing is too good for our readers, this LAST and BEST story
will be presented to them in serial form. The unique motion
pictures of THE BLACK BOX, which were produced by
the Universal Film Manufacturing Company, will be shown
at the same time in this city.
You will want to see these startling pictures, you will -want
to read this thrilling story: you will want to be among
those who solve the mystery who learn the secret of
THE BLACK BOX.
