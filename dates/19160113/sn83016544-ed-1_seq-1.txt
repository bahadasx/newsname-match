IMMENSE HAUL
St. Paul Customs House Is
Robbed of $600,000.
Thieves Blow Door of Vault, Getting
Away With $3,000 Cash Big Sum
in Negotiable Stickers.
St. Paul, Jan. 8.—Three thousand
dollars in cash and internal revenue
stamps aggregating nearly $600,000 in
value were stolen from the office of
the collector of internal revenue in
the old postoffice building when the
vault door was blown.
The robbery sets a record for gov­
ernment loss of documentary stamps.
The only previous theft of large pro­
portions was the notorious robbery at
Peoria, 111., in 1898, when $25,000
worth of war stamps were taken.
Rush B. Simmons, postoffice inspec­
tor, said that the usual method of
getting rid of postage stamps is to
sell them in bulk to stamp brokers in
New York, Chicago or St. Louis. Ac­
cording to past records, he said, post
office burglars usually got 75 per cent
of face value.
Deputies in the internal revenue of­
fice checked over their books with the
bundles of stamps left by the thieves.
Their totals, which have not yet been
proved up with a second check, show­
ed the total amount of stamps taken
to aggregate in value $576,077.51.
The stamps weighed about 300
pounds and it is believed the robbers
carried them downstairs in sacks and
had an automobile waiting outside in
an alley.
In addition to this the burglars ob­
tained cash estimated at between $3,
000 and $4,000. The money was taken
a small safe inside the vault
from which the revenue stamps were
obtained. This was all the cash in
the offices with the exception of $50
in currency which had been slipped
into an envelope.
The burglars planned their visit
most fortunately for themselves, be­
cause the vault was packed to capaci­
ty, having many thousands of dollars
in stamps more than ordinarily.
RIOTERS DESTROY
BUSINESS SECTION
Youngstown, O., Jan. 9.—With
three regiments of the Ohio national
guard, under command of Brigadier
General John H. Speaks, patrolling
the smoldering ruins of the village of
East Youngstown, or encamped in the
mills nearby, the civic and military
authorities here expressed the belief
that for the present, at least, an end
had been put to the wild scenes of
rioting and looting which left the
thriving little town a mass of embers.
One life is known to have been
lost, fully ten blocks of the town, in­
cluding the entire business section,
were burned, and several thousands
of people were driven from their
homes. The loss was placed at no
less than $1,000,000.
Physicians called to look after the
wounded placed the number at 100,
although only fifteen had been
brought to hospitals here. While the
majority had been shot, there were
many wounds from knives, bearing
out the statement that when the
rioters finally were driven from Wil­
son avenue, the main street of the
town, they began fighting among them­
selves.
HOUSE CONFERS WITH GREY

London, Jan. 10.—As the first step
