OUR NATIONAL HYMN.
My Turkey, 'tis of thee.
Swvct bird of cranberry,
Of thee I siiur.
I love thy breast mid wings,
Back, legs and other things,
I hive thy good stuffings,
O, luscious bird.
THE YEARS 1015-1916.
Father Tune, the old. heartleaa
grey -beard, has uheckod off the
last entry and elosed the last
column in the woll-thumbed ledg
er for tlie year nineteen hun
dred .in. i fifteen. That record ia
forever scaled and another ffap
ui tlie history of m-n and of na
tions is now closed. Already die
dust from the wheels of tba New
Year falls upon tlie Old Year
record, just as each succeeding
year has done, since eternal time
became measured by years.
The moat brief resume of the
everta of the past year would
entail endless labor and apace.
Volumes of history have been
made in those few weeks since
the beginning of the year 1915.
For another three hundred ami
sixty-five full work days war
madened Europe has grap
pled ii'MNi laud and sea doing
fealty to the whims of royalty.
Wh. n tlie carnage will end,
DOM but the self -ad wrtising
seers and "propheta" would at
tempt to say.
Although, advancement and in
ventions for tlie past year have
baan of a military nature, at least
in nearly one-half of the world's
lopubition. The fruit of this
I .bought and ltdsir will not ob
tain publicity until tlie present
wars are over. The geniuses that
have perfected the submarines,
the air-crafts, aiul other muni
tions of warfare will probably fail
to realize tlie commercial advant
age of their inventiona
In our own country the re
wards of jHiaee have been many.
We have during tlie aat year
lien a fortunate people, and to
Wood cow Wilson, that remark
able Htatcaman ami diplomat, a
large proportion f the credit is
due
Though the past year has made
history, the future ia problemat
ical. It now in the year li'lb
that (Mat individual and natioii.il
happin ss and .success stands un
decided and in the balance
PrOOd of tlie good derived from
ti Id year, and benefited fy
the failures, we should individ
ually shoulder our burdens ami
endeavor to make tlie present
year a better iuxI a more suc
cessful year than any preceding.
The futility of wasting time or
thought over the errors and fail
ure of tiie old year is well cx
prcased by Omar Kaliyiun, tlie
I'ersian poet :
"The Moving Finger writes, and
having writ moves on,
And- all thy piety and wit,
Cannot turn it back
Nor cancel half a line. ' '
