Miss Oma Goslin was a last week's
bride in Bracken county, which re
minds us:
"There swims no goose so gray but
some day soon or late,
An honest gander comes that ' way
and claims her'for his mate."
But some young geese do not wait
until they are gray.
"If a body trust a body
And fail to get prompt pay,
May a body ask a body,
Please remit to-day."

There are 115 divorce cases on the

A regiment made up entirely of
Americans is being recruited in Can

E. V. Debs has been nominated for
Congress by the Socialists of the Fifth
Indiana district.
At Decherd, Tenn., Mr. and Mrs.
G. Y. Miller, celebrated the 64th an

New York beat Hopkinsville in one

tilts Baraca class of the First Bap
tist church, Frankfort, adopted a res
olution exonerating Representative
W. B. Harvey from blame in the
Pumphrey-Harvey sensation.
Lexington's Leap Year bride's
dower of froo gifts was raked in by
a matrimonial bureau couple from out
of tho state. Hopkinsville merchants
should guard against an imported
frame-up, in giving presents to the
first girl who proposes t and wins a
husband.
The present general assembly has
so far proven incapable of dealing
with the most important business
matter the people expected it to con
sider, the enactment of a new revenue
law. Tho committee on Revenue
and Taxation, from indifference or
inefficiency, has not even introduced
a bill, although it was supposed a
commission had been engaged in
framing a bill for the last two years.
While the members are having per
sonal quarrels over minor matters,
this vital question, twice ordered con
sidered by constitutional amendments,
has been entirely overlooked. Gov.
Stanley has brains enough to prepare
a revenue bill and there is still a
month left. It is not too late, but
there is no more time to waste.
To a student of scundalolgy 250
miles away, there aro many elements
of improbability in the story told by
Pumnhrev on Harvey in tho heat of
the statewide logomachy. A scream
' ing chambermaid was found in front
of his open doorway in tho daytimo,
in a public corridor of a crowded ho
tel and tho charge is made that he
had passed tho bounds of ordinary
freshness and violated the eleventh
comm: mdmenL The story is im
probable, oven to tho screaming,
which seldom follows tho first stages
of flirtatious liberties with women
who aro no longer spring chickens.
Wo don't know Mr., Harvey, but to
believe his guilt it would be neces
saay to assume that he is a fool, and
one foolish grand-stand play doesn't
necessarily make a man a born idiot.
Indeed Mr. Harvey seems to bo about
as smart as tho rest of them, except
When ho is riding his great hobby
and mistaking tho Governor for a
windmill. And like Don Quixolo ho
doesn't seem Iq, tack courage,.

SPORT LOVERS
WANT BASEBALL
Hope That Clarksville
Secure Berth in the New
Kitty League.
Baseball ftlllS ill Hopkinsville,
Owcnsboro, Bowling Green and oth
er towns formerly in the Old Kitty
League circuit, are very active trying
to Restore the sport. Dr. Bassett, of
Hopkinsville, who was the life of
the old Kitty, is at tho head of the
movement, and has plans whereby
the salary limit may be reduced to a
minimum, making it possible for al
most any town to maintain a club.
In the reports Clarksville has been
mentioned several times as a mem
ber of the League, but as yet no offi
cial invitation has been extended.
Clarksville has tried on two separate
and distinct occasions league ball, but
it has always been a losing proposi
tion in tho past on account of non
support and large expenses. But
with reduced salary limit it might bo
possible for Clarksvillp to support a
team. The real lovers of tho spovt
in Clarksville aro boosting it for all
that it is worth, and when the line
up for tho franchise comes, Clarks
ville may be in her old place. Leaf'

BY H. B. M. A.
Good Roads and Mutual Co-operation
of Town and County
Discussed.
A regular meeting of the H. B. M.
A. was held Friday night and some
important matters Were discussed, the
meeting being a very interesting one;
A letter from Senator James in re
ply to one requesting him to support
the Shacklcford good roads bill was
read and proved to be disappointing;
in that Senator James did not agree
to support the bill, but said ,he would
give it due consideration.
It was decided to start a movement
to have business men write personal
letters to both Senator Jumcs and
Senator Beckham asking them to help
make this measure a law. The Sena
tors are liable to receive many such
letters in the near future, as all of this
part of Kentucky is desperately in
earnest about wanting federal aid for
state highway improvements.
The bond issue was also discussed
and universally favored. The oppo
sition seems to be much less than it
was in the beginning and the situa
tion is constantly improving.
The plan of co-operation between
tho farmers and business men was
again strongly urged by President J.
0. Cook. He recommended that the
business men keep in close touch
with the farmers' clubs, meet with
them and do everything possible to
bring about closer relations.
This system of mutual assistance
would continue to make it plain that
the interests of town and country are
so closely interwoven as to be one
and tho same.
Tho H. B. M. A. should also do ev
erything possible to help the farmers
find a satisfactory market for all of
their products at good prices.
