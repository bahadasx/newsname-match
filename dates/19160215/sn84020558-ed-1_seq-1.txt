CHICAGO. Feb. 14. Captain .Nich
olas Hunt of the detective bureau who
is directing the seauch for Jean Crones,
the missing assistant chef who is sus
pected of having poisoned the soup
which made ill more than 100 guests
at a banquet to Archbishop Mundelein
here last Thursday, said tonight that
the search had developed the existence
of a gang of fifteen anarchists whose
grudge lay principally against the
church and church men. Captain Hunt
said that he had the names of most of
the members and that detectives
liave been instructed to search for
them.
Captain Hunt named Frank Alie
grini, in whose rooms anarchistic let
ters and literature were found, as one
of the men. The names of the alleged
anarchists are said to have been taken
from the letters. They were written
in 11113 and are said to disclose a wide
spread plot, extending to Rome, Italy,
to destroy churches and church prop
erty of all creeds. According to De
tective Sergeant Paul Riccio, who
aided in translating the letters from
the Italian in which they were written,
the headquarters of the society was in
Rome. Efforts were made, it was said,
to organize branches of the society all
over the world. In the United States
public buildings were to receive the
attention of the anarchists in addi
tion to the churches. Most of the let
ters were without signatures.
One dated Chicago, March 24, !13.
was addressed to "Dear Allcgrini."
Another was dated "Salida, Colo., Sep
tember IS" and was addressed to
Dear r rank. ' It was signed "Jos.
I'olailidlni." ;
The first of the tellers, unaddresscd
and unsigned, goes into details of a
bomb invention by the writer.
"This," says the letter, "will be a
fine thing to throw among a lot of re
ligious people when they go out
dressed in their best clothes on the
boulevards to talk the sermon over."
The second letter mentioned the re
ceipt of a letter from Allegrini.
"I read your letter and am glad you
are taking interest," he said. "But J
will recommend you to be careful with
your pals because there may be some
traitors among them who cannot tell a
lie to fool Justice."
The third letter, which was written
from Salida. said: "t have sent your
trunk. Things are pretiy bud here.
The strike is pretty hot but your trunk
was in good hands all the time. That
dirty Marchi -has made a report
thai you (blank space) and they are
looking for you and I beg you to be
careful and let me know if you are in
a safe place. I wilt let you know why
when I write again. Let me know if
you are going to Barre, Vt. Then
you will give me (blank space). Let
me know .something of what is doing
over there. Mut Nicholson is working
over herewith Nic Miller and yester
day they fired Miller. I don't know
the reason why. Perhaps the reason
is that he wanted to kill Rizzi." This
letter was signed "Follalidini."
The Piqua letter mentions a person
named "I'ornara" and speaks of the
trunk containing "all those letters and
papers" as having been under water
for thirteen days. They were ruined
by the water, the letter says.
The most of the letters were not
made public. All, it was said, showed
blank spaces which apparently were
understood by the correspondents.
Several maps and drawings were
found. They were said to indicate that
the plotters had designs on the Peo
ple's Gas Light and Coke building of
Chicago, and other-costly structures.

The Germans followed up their re

Germans endeavored to surround out

In I'pper Alsace the Germans turned
loose their guns on trenches the

but the French during the night had
evacuated them and the shelling did
no other damage than to shatter the
emplacements.
Seventeen fights in the air is the
record of Sunday reported officially by
the British along their lines in Flan

activity south of La Bassee canal,
where
the Germans exploded seven
mines. Heavy bombardments and an

is reported, the Germans succeeding
in entering a British trench. They
were driven out almost immediately.

Over Three Hundred Wield

(Hood Roads In Valley's
Biggest Fete
A new way, built in a new way will
be open to the motorist who wants to
visit the rocky red buttes that lie just
nortli of the state highway in the Pap
ago Sujuaro National park. The first
stretch of road ever built by volunteer
labor in this community has been fin
ished, and it remains only to the rains
to harden and the tires of innumer
able autos to smooth its surface. In
just five hours of a perfect day, three
hundred residents of the Salt River
valley dug out a new road a half mile
long and connected it with the im
proved approaches leading up to a
saddle of rock between the southern
most bridge on the new crosscut canal
and the state highway below the fore
bay of the crosscut power planT.
It was a busy scene that The Repub
lican man found in the notch between
those two points of rock. Right in
the "saddle" was found the outdoor
cafeteria, where the cooks were busy
preparing the luncheon. On each ap
proach to this pass could be seen the
groups of workers, busy with their
fresnos, rakes, axes, picks and shovels.
Here the humble blacksmith worked
shoulder to shoulder with the Sank
president; the hardened laborer toiled
alongside the office man. Each wa.t
imbued with a desire to create some
thing out of nothing. Roads are some
thing to be proud of: the absence of
roads is nothing in the favor of the
community where good roads are an
asset.
There was a splendid and valley
wide pride evident in the work of
those men. From Arlington to Chand
ler, the valley gave up its best citi
zens to this work of making some
thing. Nearly every community had
its representatives on the ground. The
workers came from Phoenix, Tempe.
Mesa, Chandler some, as in the case
of the Chandler and the Pacific
Creamery delegations, bore banners on
their cars, signifying their approval o"f
good roads.
Every stroke of work was done by
volunteers; every bit of material used
in construction and in the incidental
work of feeding the laborers was do
nated. It was a regular testimonial
to the anility of the people hereabout
to put something over.
To the engineering- corps, led by
County Engineer Caruthers, the fore
men who handled the sections and to
the individuals goes much thanks for
a g.iod joi) well done m the interests
of the entire people.
It was not all toil, however. Never
did a duty rest more lightly on the
shoulders of a gay-hearted throng.
Th.sre was a jest with each shovel full,
and a quip with every stroke of a. pick.
Music added to this gaiety; the Indian
school band, warned that it was need

Search of the ash pile resulted from

An under gardener admitted that h
buried the poison under orders from
! the senior Orpet.
j "On today's developments we are
ready to go to trial," said Mr. Dady.
"I am convinced that the bottle pur
chased by young Orpet is the one in
which the deadly poison was con
tained. Young Orpet slept Tuesday
night in a garage on the McCormick
estate. The poison, used for spraying
plants, was accessible. The cabinet in
which it was kept was broker open.
We have not found the bottle, although
the poison was of a nature so deadly
that death must have come to Miss
Lambert before she could throw it
away. A grain of the stuff is suf
ficient to cause instant death. Orpet
has confessed that lie stood beside
her and saw her die. On these facts
we are ready to go to trial.
"Although Miss Lambert is said to
have been confronted with the fear
or an unwedded motherhood in Sep
tember, she was not in this condition
at the time of her death, the autopsy
showed, but told Orpet she was, in the
hope that he woulo remain truo to
her."
