says that:
"William Jennings Bryan, who

at the Baltimore convention, will In
'all human probability oppose his re
nomination. "This is the fixed opinion Bryan left
' In my mind after two long talks with
him recently. The fact that the pres
ident's renomlnatlon seems assured
will not alter Bryan's conviction re
garding a single term."
Bryan, in this article, Is said to be
lieve Wilson needlessly alienated the
German-Americana from the party.
If Wilson Is renominated, Bryan
will not bolt the party. On this Bryan
is quoted as saying:
j "The Lord does not require i to
