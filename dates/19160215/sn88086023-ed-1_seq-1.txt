of the annual river and harbor ap

project to deepen East river channel
in New York harbor, became known
last night The measure, aggregating
$40 ,000.000 will be Drought up at a
committee meeting today for report
to the house, with the New York
project the only request pending It
carries not only cash appropriations
for every section, but numerous au
thorizations for preliminary examina
tions and surveys at other places.
All of the actuat appropriations
proposed are for the continuance ol
work and maintenance of projects
previously authorized.
If the committee votes today, as j
urged by resident Wilson and the warj
and nav departments, to add to the
bill 1700,000 to deepen the channel
between upper New Tork bay and,
the Brooklyn navy yard, it will be the i
only new project reported to the
house. The opposition to this pro-1
ject contends that Coentles Reef,
the main obstruction "n the channel.1
