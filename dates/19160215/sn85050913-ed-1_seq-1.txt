The Iowa State Dairy association
lias completed arrangenients with
the Illinois Central railroad to oper

covering the northwestern part of
the state. Wetoater City will be fav

date has not yet been announced.
The train will carry -two exhibi

with all kinds of dairy supplies,
feeds, and practical appliances for
the up-to-date farm. Milking ma-.
chines, farm water systems, etc., will
be in operation- at every, station. The
entire train will be lighted with a
farm lighting system.
The othfer exhibition car will be
equipped as a modern dairy barn. It
be used to carry the special
dairy cattle representing the various
breeds. The animals will be used
for demonstration purposes. These
cars wijl he at each* town for sever

A corps of practical lecturers will
^accompany the train and give lect

which confront the farmer on high

the dairy herd, Bilos and silage, the

In addition, a local cow show will
be held at each town. This has prov

Vbeen conducted by the association on
its special campaigns during the past
two years. The farmers are encour

exhibit them at aome central point in
town. The animals are carefully

with their mHk uroducing character

WEAVER
Former' Well Known Webster City
Educator Passes Away in
Chicago.^
Prof. A. A. Weaver, a former well
known superintendent of the Web
ster City schools, also ex-county su
perintendent of Hamilton county,
died Friday night in Chicago, ac
cording to an item in Saturday ev
ening's Des Moines Capital. In 18S7
Prof. Weaver succeeded B. F. Barge
as principal of the Webster City
schools, coming here from Iowa
Falls. He was an educator of recog
nized ability and uhder his
ruidancs
and management our schools prog
ressed and advanced rapidly. He
was principal until 1892, when he
was succeeded by Prof. E. T. Fitch.
In r»94 Prof. Weaver was elected
county superintendent of schools and
served one term. Soon after his re
tlracy from the superintendent's of
fice, he became associated with a
prominent school bonk concern as
salesman and held this position with
them, we believe, up to the time of
his death. Some sixteen-or eighteen
years ago he removed to Des Moines
with his family and in the past few
years has had his headquarters in
Chicago.
The many friends of the Weaver
family in this city will very muq'i
regret to hear of Prof. Weaver's tali-,
ing away.
The Capital says of Prof. Weaver's
death:*
Word was received here todky of
the sudden death in Chicago last
night of A. A. Weaver of this city,
brother of Justice Silas M. Weaver
and father of Miss Florence Weaver

FIVE FIRES
DODGE IN TWO DAYS
Fire Department Kept Busy Re­
sponding to Calls—Little Dam­
age Results.
Fort Dodge, Feb. 14.—Five fires
have occurred here since yesterday
shortly before noon. Between the
hours of 11:30 and 1:30 three calls
were turned' in, the first was from
the home of Mrs. M. D. Kelley, where
a blaze in the roof was extinguished',
piesumably having caught from a
defective chimney. Shortly after the
department's return to the station
another residence call was received
and while the fire boys were still
fighting the fire, but having it under
control, a call reached them by tele
phone to make a run to the home of
Mrs. Mary Hogan. Owing to the de
lay of getting the'message to the de
partment the fire had gained some
headway and the damage was
considerable. The loss is estimated
at $500. The first two residence fires
were but small affairs and easily
checked wtth a total loss of about
$100.
This morning at an early hour a
call wafi turned in from the J. W.
Johnson grocery store in west Fort
Dodge. The department quickly re
sponded add control was gained over
the blaze with little resultant dam
age. However, the fire station was
no sooner reached than an alarm was
sounded from the Interurban freight
depot, but through a misunderstand
ing of some one a mistake was made
in locating the fire and the blaze
reached considerable proportions be
fore the fire boys arrived on the
scene. Control was gained over the
fire, which is thought to have origin
ated from a gasoline heater, and
buri\ed the partitions frdm between
two rooms. The damage is estimat
ed at $1,000.

MODI
LECTURE COURSE?
Outlook is Not Flattering—Webster
City Ought to Have One
Next Winter.
The proposition held up to the
women's federated clubs of this city
last week for a lecture course for
next winter has not met with favor.
The matter was discussed in the club
meetings and the clubs widely differ
ed in their opinions of the success of
such a venture. Some of the clubs
favor a three number course with
such numbers as Dr. Edward Stein
er of Grinnell, Katherine Ridgway
concert company, etc. If1 such a
course could be offered for $1.50 the
idea, it is thought, would meet with
favor, and many tickets could be
sold. On the other hand, several
ctybs favored the giving of one flne
musical number or lecture during
the year. This idea would of course
be a good one, but the price of a real
ly fine lecture or concert would be
prohibitive to the very ones who need
the inspiration and uplift of a lect
ure course.
It is tod bad for a town of 6,000
inhabitants to give up the idea of
a lecture course. Movies, home tal
ent plays and concerts should not
furnish the sum total of attractions
for a long winter. It la true that
thoee church societies who have had
lecture courses within the past four
or five years have either come out at
the end barely even with their obli
gations, or else a little behind. Those
who worked hard to sell tickets for
the last few courses are pessimistic
regarding the outlook1 for another
course. But it is possible, surely, for
the town to support a three number
course consisting of very good ma-

WEBSTER CITY
WINS TWO GAMES
Local Basket Ball Squad Defeats
Jewell College and Nevada
High SchooL
The local high school basket ball
team added two more victories to
their list Friday afternoon and
evening, by decisively defeating the
Jewell Lutheran College team and
the Nevada high school quintette.
The afternoon game with the Jew
ell squad was a holiday romp for the
lpcal boys. The visiting Norwegians
were beefy, but they lacked the
knowledge of the game possessed by
the Webster City squad, and the
game ended with an entire second
string llnd-up for Webster City. The
subs, like the regulars, seemed able
to score at will, and the final whistle
showed the score standing at 56 to
20 for Webster City. France and Wil
kinson led the scoring for Webster
City, with nine and eight baskets re
spectively, while Peterson, with four
baskets, was the star for the visitors.
In the evening the opposition was
furnished by the high school squad
from Nevada. This game was much
tighter than the afternoon encount
er,, and resulted in a 26 t,o J. 6 victory
for the locals. Tlje' score, however,
does not.indicate the real margin of
victory, for the afternoon game
showed its effects in slow team work
by Webster City, especially in the
second half. Greenwood led the bas
ket-shooting with five tallies. Har
rington of Ames did the officiating^
and his work was among the best
seen on the local' floor this year. For
Nevada, Shaw was the main scoring
cog, earning twelve of the sixteen
points for Nevada.
This makes a total of five victories
out of six games played 1y Webster
City this season. The next game
will be clayed with Clarion on the
home floor next Saturday evening,
Feb. 19. On comparative scores.
Clarion has one of the foremost
teams In the Boone Valley, and the
game will no doubt be close.
Sale a Success.
The public sale at the H. E. Prin
gle barn in this city-Saturday after
noon was a success, the aggregate
sales amounting to more than $2,
300. These sales are held from time
to time and give opportunity for the
sale of stock and goods by owners
who do not have enough stuff to hold
a separate sale. At the sale Satur
day a number of horses, cattle, farm
machinery, household goods, etc.,
were sold. Many bidders were pres
ent and the bidding was spirited.

GIRLS WIN DEBATE
Webster City Team Loses Contest by
a Decision of 2
To 1.
The girls" debating teams of Al
gona and Webster City engaged in a
close forsenic contest Friday night
on the local platform, the Algona
girls emerging from the smoke of
battle as victors by the narrow maj
gin of a 2 to 1 decision.
Webster City was represented by
Olive Bateman, Lila Neel and Louise
Swanson, while Algona's team con
sisted 9f Frances Malone, Helen
Balkheiiier and Eleanor Norton. The
local team supported the affirmative
side of the minimum wage question.
During the entire debate, the two
teams were practically on even
terms, the Webster City girls perhaps
being superior in their constructive
argument, and the Algona trio as a
whole having a decided advantage in
delivery. ,(v
The feature of the debate was the
superior work of Louise Swanson for
Webster City. All three judges unit
ed in declaring her work the most
effective of any of the six speakers.
For Algona, Miss Balkhelner was ther
best debater.
The debate was judged by W. A.
