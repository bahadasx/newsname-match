Chicago, Feb. 15. Police authori
ties of Chicago and many large cities
of the nation are hunting for anarch
ists Involved In a plot, the ramifica
tions of which spread all over the
world, to wreck churches and kill
the clergy.
The plot waa fully revealed today
after Interpreters had dug Into Ital
ian letters found on John Allegrlnl.
arrested as a witness In the conspir
acy to poison Archbishop Mundelein,
Governor Dunne and many other no
tables at a banquet here last week.
The poison banquet was Insigni
ficant compared to the deadly alms of
the (Plot as a whole.
Steeped In the bitterness of reli
gious hatred, the plotters, taking
their directions from an anarchistic
headquarters In Rome, were to blast
churches, kill clergy and ruin public
buildings In this country.
No creed was to be spared. Fif
teen persons are said to have consti
tuted this gang of "reds" and the
police are now making every effort
te round them up.
Meanwhile the authorities are
hopeful of catching soon Jean Crones,

Correspondent Says That
Former Premier of Presi
dent's Cabinet Will Be
Against Second Term
New York, Feb. 16. "William
Jennings Bryan, the man who made
President Wilson's nomination pos
sible at Baltimore, will in all human
probability oppose his renomlnatlon
In Juno," said the Evening Post's
Washington correspondent in a copy
righted article today.
"This was the fixed impression
Bryan left in my mind after two long
talks with him recently. He asked
particularly that nothing be said
about his views until the president
had announced his candidacy, and
even then he did not want to be re
stricted in any utterance or pro
nouncement in advance of the con
vention. He wanted to be free to do
as he thought best to express him
self at the moment he thought was
most opportune.
"The fact that President Wilson's
renomlnatlon seems assured will not
alter Bryan's conviction about the
single term for president, tor he Is
wedded to that principle. He holds
that It is -vitally related to the public
welfare and he has held that view'
for twenty years long before he
ever heard about President Wilson."
The correspondent stated, how
ever, that Bryan's opinion will be
'based nfore on technicalities, and
that preparedness and "many other
differences" will furnish him with the
ammunition to fight the second term.
It Wilson is nominated, though,
Bryan will not bolt him, the writer
stated.
"The Lord does not require us to
win. He simply requires us to do
our duty," Bryan was quoted as say
ing. The former premier believes, it
was stated, that President Wilson
has needlessly alienated the German-
American vote and is saddling dem
ocracy with unnecessary burdens.
from their contents the recipient ap
parently knew the sender and knew
who waa meant when 'blank spaces
were left in the writing.
One of them told of a new bomb
that would "be fine thing to throw
among a lot of religious people" af
ter church attendance on Sunday.
Another discussed the Colorado
strike and said things were getting
"pretty hot" there. -
The pot is believed to hare In

destroy St. Patrick's Catholic church
In New York, together with plans to

of local (banking men were marked

ities have refused to throw particular
Itght on this phase of the case while
hunting for the man. '
The plotters are believed to have
a surprisingly large fund for destruc
tion and for ball of any arrested
members. Strenuous efforts were
made to get the release of Allegrlnl,
and ball to almnBt any amount was
offered. Authorities) however, re
fused to release, him overnight and
said emphatically that nothing would

LUSTAM
CAUSE OF STRIFE
. Ill
Berlin, Feb. 15. Settlement of the
Lusltanla negotiations has suddenly
become the center of violent party
storms.
The newspapers today attacked
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
and Foreign Secretary von Jagow for
falling to explain terms of the settle
ment in the relchstag, and declared
that these officials ought to tell the
public whether Germany bad made
further concessions tending to cripple
Germany's submarine warfare.
The papers, however, expressed de
light at the unofficial reports of a
settlement. Inasmuch as they are
anxious that good relations between
Germany and the United States shall
be maintained. They considered that
neither side had triumphed, and be
lieved that a compromise on both
sides was more gratifying than It one
nation had yielded all to the other.
Conservatives, desirous of annex
ing Belgium because of its harbors
and Its iron ore, are very Mtter and
are carrying this feeling into the
Lusltanla fight On the other hand,
the radicals are now supporting the
government

CLUB HOLDS
Commercial Body Discusses
Many Hatters Affecting its
Pcblic Welfare at Regular
Monthly Meeting last Night
At the regular meeting of the Com
mercial club Monday night a number
of most Interesting subjects were up
for discussion. The special commit
tee that had been appointed at a pre
vious meeting announced that the
city and the water company were
working upon a plan for lowering the
water charge during the period when
there was greatest need tor water
for lawns. It was reported that a
request would probably be made to
the state commission for a reduction
of the water rate during the months
of July and August. The special rate
nnder consideration was said to be
the making of the charge for water
after the minimum charge of $1.20
for the first 300 cubic feet, 10' cents
instead of 17c per 100 cubic feet
Members of the club who discussed
the question thought that the re
duced - rate should cover a longer
period. It being practically as neces
sary to Irrigate in June and Septem
ber as In July and August The club
made nb further recommendations In'
the matter. . The officers of the club
were instructed to communicate with
the council in an effort to have the
city make a filing upon water for
municipal purposes from either
the Rogue or some other available
source, and hold the right for future
development and use. It is under
stood by the club that under a state
law municipalities can make such fil
ings and hold the water till It may
ibe convenient to develop it
A plan that had been proposed for
the Issuance of a tourist guide was
endorsed by the club, and the ad
vertising committee will work out
the plan. A small booklet will be pub
lished showing numerous trips that
can be made from Grants Pass as a
center from the short tours of from
one to several hours over the roads
adjacent to the city to the longer
ones to the Caves, to Crescent City,
Crater lake, and other points of in
terest Supervisor Macduff, of the
Siskiyou national forest, who was
present at the meeting, kindly offer

that down the Rogue river and the

of these photos at the Commercial

ternoon as the result of a fire that
tor hours flamed In the Pennsylvania
