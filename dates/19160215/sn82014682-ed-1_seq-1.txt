KITCHWS BILL
REPEAL OF FREE SUGAR CLAUSE
: Associated Press Service by Federal Wireless.!
The Star-Bulletin cabled its Washington correspondent yesterday to get
the substance of the Kltchin sugar tariff bill, about ' which there was con
siderable doubt here. This morning the following cablegram came in reply:
"WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 15. The Kltchin bill provides for unequiv
ocal repeal of the free sugar section." . v..
it is thus evident that the Kltchin bill, which is the administration
measure, does not merely suspend the operation of the "free sugar" clause
indefinitely or for a number of years. If the Kltchin Wl passes, new legis
- latlon at some future Congress will be necessary to put sugar on tbe'"free

is assuming larger, and larger propor

thought many visitors' may wish ' to
enter,-the number of entries Is ex
pected to exceed 125. -' . '
In . past years the auto parade' has
attracted several cars entered by vis
itors, even though in these:, past car
nivals the, decorations have been ex
tremely: elaborate. This year sim
plicity and- ease of decoration have
been ' two of the essential points, and
