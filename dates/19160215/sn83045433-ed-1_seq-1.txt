"I am not for any particular

He has deadened the conscience

LIQUOR VOTE
Senators Would Have District
Decide Triennially on Pro
hibition Question.
UNDERWOOD WILL STEER
PROJECT THROUGH SENATE
"Dry" Forces Will Seek to Make Bal- ;
lot Here Disqualify Voter
Elsewhere.
By JOSEPH P. ANN If*.
A law requiring a triennial referen
dum on the question of prohibition in
the District, or whenever 45 per cent
of those qualified to vote on a refer
endum shall ask for it, virtually has
been determined upon by Senators,
who will propose pu bm fitina the
Sheppanl bill to the people of the
District.
The form of the referendum is that
which obtained in Alabama before
State-wido prohibition was adopted.
The measure will be prepared in large
part by Senator Underwood.
In the event that the referendum
provision passes the Senate, the pro
hibition forces will fight to incorpor
ate in the measure a stipulation that
a voter on the referendum shall be
disqualified from voting elsewhere.
IniliTHiiml >'?t 1 n I ?*r?**t*'(I.
Senator Underwood said yesterday
that he was not particularly interested
in that phase of the question.
Both Senators Dlllingham and Suth
erland declared that the question wa?
altogether one for the Senate to de
termine through the wording of the
act.
"The District Is a government reser- |
vation over which Congress exercise?
exclusive control because at present
It does not organize it Into a self
governing community," declared Sen
ator Dilli ngham, ranking Republican
member of the District Committee.
"If Congress chooses, fr. considering
a proposed piece of legislation for the ?
District, to consult the people of the '
District, Congress has a perfect right
to do so and to epecify what people
she wishes to consult."
?( onetltution .Not Affected.**
"The constitution i-> in no way af
fected," si id Senator Sutherland, rank
ing Republican on the Judiciary Com- ,
mittee. "It is purely a matter of ;
legislation for Congress to settle. The
referendum could have no binding
force, that Is, action on the prohibi
tion bill could not be contingent upon
the result of the referendum."
