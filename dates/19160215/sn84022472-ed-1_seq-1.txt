Over Supply of Soft
Coal Follows Shortage
With yards only partly emptied by
he recent cold snap, Bridgeport today
faces a coal glut, with the arrival of
S5 barges laden with between 1,000 and
1,500 tons each of bituminous.'
Glistening with the rays of a shin
ing sun which sparkled from' the ice
overed hatches and davits, of long
strings of tows, tug after tug pulled
into the harbor today and anchored' off
the local stake-boat.
While a few boat.' had already
waited at the stake-boat for unload
ing berths, there were numbers being
unloaded at the various coal-pockets.
Is is estimated that with the pockets
working . night and day it will take
more than a week to unload the car
goes of. this morning and barge cap
tains, who will have an enforced idle
period, are already placing bets upon
the amount of demurrage that will be
paid them here on this trip.
TOBACCO WAREHOUSE BURNS.
Wapping, 6onn., Feb. 15 A large
tobacco warehouse filled with tobacco
was burned here today with its con
tents. . The loss is estimated at about
$10,000. The cause of the fire is not
known, and it was intimated that the
state police might be called in to in
vestigate, as they were in several other
fires on tobacco properties in which
the origin of the fire was also regard
ed as suspicious. The owner was
Everett Griswold. .
Washington, Feb. 15 That Louis
D. Brandeis was guilty of improper
conduct toward the United Shoe Ma
chinery Co. was charged by S. W.
Winslow, president of the company,
before the Senate sub-committee to
day. ,He charged that Brendeis at
tacked as illegal the acts and methods
of the company in which he had par
ticipated and assisted to - create.
Mr. Bailey first made a general
statement that he had been opposed
to Mr. Brandeis in several law cases
but considered tjieir relations friendly.
Mr. Brandeis 'assisted his partner,
Samuel D. Warren, in framing a plan
which Bailey said placed his partner
in poasition individually antagonistic
to Warren's position as trustee. ,
"This," said Bailey, "as I shall call
attention to later, resulted in a breach
of trust. Mr. Brandeis and his firm
acted for 15 or 20 year's as counsel
for Mr. ' Warren and associates as
trustees under - an annual retainer of
S 2.000 and for Mr. Warren and other
Individuals as lessors of property, un
der a retainer. These interests were
antagonistic in some Important par
ticulars, and the. reslrlt was that the
beneficiaries, one of whom was my
client, suffered financial damage in the
sum of some hundreds of thousands of
dollars." .. . : ,
"The Boston bar's opinion of Bran
deis," said Bailey, was that he was an
"able lawyer, keenest intellect, an able
advocate, -but' not entirely trust-

BRIDGEPORT POLICEMEN
L TO GET NEW STYLE OF
j LTNIFORM FOR SUMMER
Policemen will not be compelled to
wear half length overcoats next win
ter and they will be comfortably, robed
in long ulsters, which will reach al
most to the ankles. , There will be two
side pockets, slanting ones, and the
revolver will be carried. In one and
the- "billy" in the other.; ' . -
Commissioner Lyddy ."brought the
matter before the" board, saying that
two policemen had complained to him
about the. present style of garment.
They claim it is too cumbersome, too
tight fitting and not a warm garment..
Commissioner Lyddy said he had two
policemen demonstrate the difficulty
of pulling a revolver .from the pocket
of the- coat
One of them was unable to pull his
gun, the belt of the coat interfering
with him- and Commissioner Lyddy
had to lift the belt from the police
man's coat before the latter could get
his gun out. - The commissioner ia in
favor of dispensing . with uniform
belts.
The new coats probably will be cC
the New York style of police over
coat uniform and will be similar to
those worn by the guards at the Rem
ington Arms & Ammunition Co. Com
missioners Lyddy and George C. Baet
were appointed a committee to select
the- style of coat and to get the prices
on the garment. The latter will not be
adopted until about April when it is
expected the new batch of policemen
will . be appointed. They will then
be instructea as to the style t overf
coat to purchase for wear for next
winter.

Yellow Mill channel, warped In at 7

before 2 o'clock this' morning. She
departed for Hoboken, N. J., on the

The scene at the dock when the
enormous quantity of powder was be
ing handled as if it were nothing more
serious than a few paving block's, was
interesting. -Without lights, working!
by sense of touch alone, half a hun
dred expert powder handlers of the
U. M. C. Co., with a score of motor
trucks aided in the unloading. '
"No smoking" was the rule fol
lowed jot only throughout the trip of
the Ara- but in . the surrounding -yards
during the process of removal. A
chain of men passed the powder can
isters to tire trucks, which were
quickly loaded and with, their driver
and complement of two guards each.
pulled away that others might replace
them. The . powder carried . to the
Barnum avenue yards of the U. M. C.
CO., was placed in cars and transferred
to the magazines.
At the City Ice & Coal Co. yards
today there was a sigh of relief when
it was learned vthe dangerous cargo
was unloaded. Yet men in the pow
der business declace there is less dan
fer handling this product when the
know-how" is learned than the pieces
of steel used in construction.
On board the Ara the captain, his
wife and one man for crew were all
that fjiarded the cargo on it- cruise.
Cold meals were the order of the day
and the captain ordered the cook stove
lighted as soon as he got underway
for New York. It Is likely that many
cook stoves in the vicinity of Seaview
aVenue were not lighted last night. A
general relief is felt that the powder
has gone.

Chicago, Feb. 15 Search was started today for the princi-i
pals in what.is believed by the police to have been a plot to des-j
troy buildings and kill members of the clergy, bankers and
others ia a dozen cities in various sections of the United States. :
.... Discovery of the alleged' plot, according to the police, re
sulted from examination of the personal effects of John lle-:
grini, ccrnfident of Jean Crones, who is charged by the authori-'
tiep: with putting poison in soup at the banquet given Arch-
bishop George .W. Mundelein at the University Club Thursday:

ters written in Italian found in Alle

established the existence of an anti
clerical organization headed by a
"committee of 15" of which Crones
and JAllegrini are believed to have
been members! The police are search

sistant chef ,at the University club.
Allegrini is in jail charged with con

lice were guarded in making public
the contents of Allegrini's correspond
ence but it was stated that plans and

large down town buildings in Chicago,
which, it is said, had been marked
for destruction by th3 committee.

the alleged - conspirators. At first it
was believed that the illness of the j
banqueters was caused from ptomaine '
poisoning but discovery of the plot
to poison ' guests at - the Mundelein i
dinner has given strength to the be- j
lief that the illness of the other ban-
queters may have been due to a sim- :
ilar plot. .
In connection with the alleged plana
plans of the conspirators to destroy'
public buildings and church property,
police records show that two score
or more Chicago churches have suf
fered fire losses within the last few
years. At the' Moody church, it was
said, no less' than six fires, said to have
been of Incendiary origin, have been
discovered and extinguished with small
losses during the last year.
Other churches In which incendiary
fires j have been discovered, include
Grace Episcopal church.which was de
stroyed Sept. 26 last: Oakland Meth
odist church; Norwood Park Methodist
church; Hawthorne Park Methodist
church; St. Sebastian's. Roman Cath
olic church; Evangelical Lutherriji; St.
Nicholas church; .'Trinity Reformed
Episcopal church and three Episcopal
churches, St. Chrysostom's, All Saints
and St. Albany's.
f The principal , development in the
case . yesterday was the finding of a
letter in Allegrini't. pocket in which
reference was made to a fund collected
for the widow (Of Gaetano Brescia, who
assassinated King Humbert, of Italy.
Subsequent developments have led the
police to believe that Crones and Al-.-legrinl
may have had knowledge off
the plot" to assassinate , the Italian
monarch. ' . . ' . "
That an attempt to blow up the
state penitentiary at Joliet, 111., was one;
of the plans of the. alleged plotters, the
police said today, was indicated by one
of the Allegrini letters.
Recentlyf.it became known that dy
namite in quantities sufficient to wreck
many buildings had been found sec
reted in the. penitentiary. ; .
The letter, which was not signed,'
read :
"There are many-good men penned ;
