CHICAGO, February 15.?
. Search was started today for the
principals in what is believed by
the police to have been a plot to
destroy buildings and kill members
of the clergy, bankers and
others in a dozen cities in vari- ,
cus sections of the United States.
Discovery of the alleged plot, according
to the police, resulted
from examination of personal ef- ;
fects. of John Allegrini, confidant ,
of Jean Crones, who is charged ]
by the authorities with putting 1
poison in soup at the banquet 1
? A?t-ui-t r* . \\T
given rvreuuisnuy ucuigt *v. ,
Mundelin at the University Club
Thursday night, and causing the
illness of 100 of the guests.
Chief of Police He&ly, Chief of Detectives
Nicholas Hunt and DeputyChief
of Police Herman Schuettler announced
today, after studying translations
of letters written in Italian
found in Allegrini's rooms, that they
regarded as established the existence
of an anti-clerical organization, headed ,
* by a "committee of fifteen," of which j
Crones and Allegrini are believed to <
have been members. ^ 4
Police are searching for Crones, who ,
is a former assistant chef at the University
Club. Allegrini is in Jail,
charged with conspiracy to commits 1
murder. j
Contents of Letters Guarded. ]
The police were guarded in making ]
public the contents of Allegrini's cor- \
respondence, but it was stated that ]
plans and specifications were found of j
several large downtown buildings in t
Chicago which, it is said, had been <
marked for destruction by the commit- .
tee. These included the People's Gas '
Light and Coke Company building, one
of the largest office buildings in Chi- ,
c&go; the Union League Club and the J
federal building. ,
That an attempt to blow up the state ,
penitentiary at Joliet, 111., was one of j
the plans of the alleged plotters, the 1
police said today, was indicated by one \
of the Allegrini letters.
Recently it became known that dy- <
namite in quantities sufficient to wreck
many buildings had been found secreted
in the penitentiary.
The letter, which was not signed,
road:
There are many good men penned
up like hogs in Joliet. What a wonderful
thing it would be if we could
frfft th*m. It u-nnlrt ho hard. Vnn
know F is there."
The attempt to wreck St. Patrick's
Roman Catholic Church in New York a
year ago also is believed by Capt. Hunt
to have been a part of the alleged plot. '
According to the detective, who did the
translating, certain leaders in a conspiracy
which is said to be international
in scope have headquarters in
Rome.
He added that some of the letters
contained detailed descriptions of
bombs used by the conspirators. Some
of these, he said, were designed to
wreck buildings, others to kill policemen
and still others to spread death
among churchgoers "when they are
walking away from church discussing
the sermon."
Committeemen Known.
Names of the "committee of fifteen"
are said to he in the hands of the police,
and it was predicted that the arrest
of some of the committee members
would be made before night.
Chief of Detectives Hunt has communicated
with Nashville, Tenn.; Sa114a.
Col.: St. Paul, and St. Louis in the
hope of apprehending Crones in one of
those cities.
Police working on the cases pointed
out today that the illness of fifty
guests who attended the Knights of
Columbus banquet October 2 last might
have been due to activities of the alleged
conspirators. At first it was be1
lieved the illness of the banqueters
was caused from ptomaine poisoning,
but discovery of the plot to poison
guests at. the Mundelein dinner has
given strength to the belief that the
Illness of the other banqueters may
have been due to a similar plot.
In connection with the alleged plans
Of the conspirators to destroy public
buildings and church property police
records show that twoscore or more
Chicago churches have suffered fire
losses within the last few years. At
the Moody Church, it was said, no less
than six fires, said to have been of incendiary
origin, have been discovered
and extinguiahed with small loas during
the last year.
Other churches in which incendiary
Ares have been discovered include
Or&ce Episcopal Church, which wraa
destroyed September 26 last: Oakland
Mothodist Church. Norwood Park Methodist
Church. Auburn Park Methodist
Church. St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic
Church. Evangelical Lutheran. St.
Nicholas' Church. Trinity Reformed
Episcopal Church, and three other
that Crones and Allegrini may have
All Saints' and Saint. Alban s.
One of the Interesting developments
in the case yesterday was the finding
of a letter in Allegritii'a pocket, in
/ which reference was made to a fund
collected for the widow of Gaetano
Br esc I, who assassinated King Humbert
of Italy. Subsequent development#
have led the police to believe
Kpiecopal churches?St. Chrysostom's,
had knowledge of the plot to assassiuate
the Italian monarch.
BREAKS IN LEVEE
FLOOD WIDE AREA
Several Parishes in Louisiana
Threatened by Onrushing
Mississippi Waters.
I IMtLY WAHIMINU LIKtLT
TO AVERT LOSS OF LIFE
Many Thousands of Acres and Several
Towns Expected to Be
Inundated.
NATCHEZ, Miss., February
15.?Two breaks occurred early
today in tbe Mississippi levee at
Limerick plantation, about twenty-five
miles above St. Joseph,
La., and six miles from Newelton,
on the Louisiana side, according
to reports received here.
It was stated that a large volume
of water was rushing through
the breaks and would flood Tensas.
Concordia, Franklin, Catahoula
and possibly Madison
parishes in Louisiana.
Inhabitants Given Warning.
The report of the break was received
here early this morning by W. C. Barton,
one of the government engineers
in charge of levees in this district,
who later started for the crevasse.
Mr. Barton said ne nopea mere wouiu
be no loss of life, as warnings were
sent by telephone and by couriers on
horseback to the section in the path
of the flood, and he believed the inhabitants
of the section would have
time to escape. Many thousands of
acres would be inundated, he said, and
among the towns which may be flooded
or surrounded by the onrushing
waters are Newellton, St. Joseph, Viialia,
Waterproof and Farriday.
According to reports to Mr. Barton
the crevasse occurred in the basin of
Lake St. Joseph, and he thought the
high banks of the/ lake probably
would hold back the water for a time
and enable residents on the plantations
to reach places of safety. The back
levee around the town of St. .Joseph, he
said, might protect that place from
inundation.
House Committee Near Scene.

NON-CliTMlS
TO BRIDGE LOCATION
War Department Defers Advocate
of H Street Site to Congress
Committees.
Again the War Department has declined
to commit itself as to the best
location for the Washington approach
to the proposed new bridge across the
Potomac river to replace the antiquated
Aqueduct bridge. Frank C. Heil
of 2308 H street recently wrote to the
Secretary of War, requesting that he
"do all in his power" to have the new
span located at the foot of H street
west.
After consultation with (Jen. Kingman.
chief of engineers, Maj. Gen.
Scott, acting Secretary of War, has replied
to Mr. Hell, saying that the matter
of a new bridge across the Potomac
is now entirely in the hands of
Congiess and suggesting that any arguments
he may wish to present concerning
the best location for the bridge
be submitted to that body.
Practically Same Location.
The acting secretary explained that
it was the understanding of the department
that the Carlin bill, now
pending in Congress, contemplates the
construction of a new bridge in practically
the same location as the existing
bridge, the language used irt the bill
being, "at or near what is now known
as the Aqueduct bridge."
A renort on that bill was made b.v
the department January 28, 1916, and
that report. Gen. Hcott says, "was confined
mainly to the question of whether
or not a bridge at or near the present
location could be built upon safe foundations
and within the sum of money
named in the bill." It was not believed.
Gen. Scott said, that Congress
desired a report from the War Department
on the question of location. The
bill in question is understood to be
under consideration by the committee
on interstate and foreign commerce of
the House of Representatives.

Potomac Park's Beauty.
The opponents of the proposed
central power plant for the gov.ernment,
who believe the plant
will be a biot on the landscape
of the National Capital as at present
designed, today won a partial
victory in the Senate. A resolution
offered by Senator Phelan
of California, providing that the
Secretary of the Treasury be requested
to modify the plans for
the power plant as far as possible
to harmonize better with the park
commission's plan for the improvement
of the commercial
water front of Washington, was
adopted by the Senate.

1 HIS 1CSU1ULIUII \vc13 uulivu
yesterday afternoon by' Senator
Plielan following the adoption of
the conference report on the
urgent deficiency bill, which
struck out the Newlands amendment
prohibiting the construction
of the power plant until after
the plans had been approved by
the fine arts commission and the
President. Senator Phelan's
resolution at that time went over
on objection^of Senator Martin of
Virginia. It came up in the regular
order of business today, and
Senator Phelan moved its adoption.
\
Support From Senator Galllnger.
Senator Galllnger of New Hampshire
spoke in favor of the adoption of the
resolution, although he had opposed
the Newlands amendment yesterday.
Senator Bryan of Florida suggested
that the resolution should flrst be sent
to the proper Senate committee for
report. The Senate, however, agreed
to the resolution.
By a vote of forty-four to twenty-one
the Senate late yesterday afternoon voted
down the proposition to hold up the construction
of the proposed government
central power plant on the site selected
on 14th street southwest.
The vole was given to sustain the conference
report on the urgent deficiency
bill, in which Senator Newlands* amendment,
providing that the construction of
the power plant be delayed until after
the fine arts commission and the President
had passed upon the plans, was
stricken from the bill.
Senator Newlands proposes to continue
the fight against the erection of the
plant along the lines now laid down,
which he declares would mar the beauty
of the capital.
Will Press His Resolution.
He has a resolution similar to his
amendment now pending before the 11*

will seek to have the. committee report
the resolution favorably to the Senate,
so that he may get a vote on that measure
alone and not connected with the
items of an appropriation bill.
Throughout the afternoon Senator
Newlands urged the Senate to give
heed to the advice of the architects and
engineers of the country who have
warned against the central power plant
as designed. Senator Martin of Virginia,
chairman of the appropriations
committee, took issue with Senator
Newlands and sprung a surprise when
he had read to the Senate a letter from
President Wilson to himself saying
that he, the President, did not consider
it would be wise to delay the construction
of the power plant.
How the Senators Voted.
The vote on the adoption of the conference
report was as follows: ,

Senator Phelan of California, who supported
Senator Newlands* contention,
tried to get the Senate to adopt a resolution
asking the Secretary of the Treasury
to have the plans for the power
plant modified as far as possible to meet
the approval of the fine arts commission.
Senator Martin, however, objected to
consideration of the resolution, which
was sufficient to prevent its being taken
The Senate then voted to further insist
upon its amendments to the deficiency
bill still in dispute, and appointed
conferees.

New York Delegation to National

PARTY WORKERS MEET
FOR STATE CONVENTION
Elihu Boot to Outline Issues of Coming
Campaign at First Session
Tonight.
NEW YORK. February 15.?The important
question in the minds of delegates
to the republican state convention,
who assembled here today for the
opening of the convention tonight, was
whether Gov. Charles * S. Whitman
would head the delegation from New
York state to the republican national
convention. That the governor would
be designated as one of the four delegates-at-large
was conceded by the
party leaders.
The governor has announced that he
expects to lead the New York delega
tion to the national convention, but in
advance of the opening: of the state
convention there was said to be a difference
of opinion among the leaders
as to whether he should be accorded
that honor. It was pointed, out. that
the state convention, under the new
primary laws, can only designate the
delegates at large for submission fo
the voters at. the primaries on April
4, and that the chairman of the delegation
may not actually be selected
until the whole New York delegation
meets in Chicago on the eve of the
national convention.
Wads worth to Be One.
The choice of United' States Senator
James W. Wadsworth, jr.. as one of the
"big four" was conceded. The . two
other places lay among Frederick O.
Tanner of this city, chairman of the
republican state committee: William
Berri of Brooklyn and Dr. David Jayne
Hill of Rochester, formerly American
ambassador to Germany. '
Gov. Whitman looks to the convention
to indorse hi sadministration, and
delegates predicted today that some
kind of indorsement would be gi^en.
The convention was called to meet in
Carnegie Hall at 8 o'clock tonight. Elihu
Root "will call the convention to order as
temporary chairman and deliver a speech
outlining issues of the coming national
campaign. After choosing its conwnittees
the convention is expected to adjourn
r.ntil tomorrow morning when Senator
Wadsworth will be elected permanent
chairman.
Notwithstanding that the primary law
tas shorn the state convention of a great
deal of its former power, tonighi's meeting
is full of significance to the members
of the republican party as foreshadowing
the upirit of the national convention
i in June.

Prohibition Measure.
!r
! a
r Submission to the people of the Dis- IJ
trict of Columbia of the question |e
whether the District shall continue j h
under the existing restricted license h
system or adopt prohibition in dealing n
with the liquor traffic is provided in a *
bill introduced in the Senate this aft- C
ernoon by-Senator Underwood of Alabama.
It was offered as a substitute "
to the Sheppard prohibition bill. d
The measure provides that upon peti- u
tion of 25 per cent of the male taxpayers
of -the District of Columbia t
over the age of twenty-one. asking g
that an election be held to submit the
liquor question to the qualified voters
of the District, the Commissioners
shall within, thirty days order an election
to be held within forty days there- !i

The qualified voters shall consist of u
male residents over the age of,twentyone
years, of sound mind and who have j
not been convicted of felony, and who
have resided for more than one year a
in the precinct in which they vote. a
The suceeding six sections of the
bill deal with the details of calling, ?
holding and safeguarding elections. J
Question of Ballots. 11
It is then provided that in the elec- v
tions thus authorized the questions 1
shall be first whether the liquor traffic ?
shall be conducted under existing law n
or prohibited by the terms of the Sheppard
act.
If the majority of the legal voters
shall decide that the liquor traffic shall
continue as now regulated by law it I
shall be so conducted, but if the ma- x
jority or tne voters vote in favor of l
prohibition the Sheppard bill shall be
enforced.
Senator Underwood's bill then goes c
on to quote the exact terms of the tl
Sheppard bill as indicative of what the r,
law shall be if the majority of the .
voters decide in favor of prohibition.
At the end of his bill, however, he
has a proviso that within three years c
another election may be held to deter- z
mine the wishes of the voters. ?

for War Office.
'OLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES
ROB JOB OF ATTRACTION
[f Unable to Get Man He Wants,
Executive Will Make Shift
in His Cabinet.
President Wilson had made no progess
today toward the selection of a
lecretary of War, according to trustworthy
information. It is his desire, it
9 stated, to obtain a good lawyer from
he middle west for the position, and
te has one or two men of that descripion
in mind. He has not yet made an
ffer of the honor, and does not know
whether the offer will be accepted. If
>e does not get the man he wants he
will make a shift in his cabinet by
ending Secretary Lane or Secretary
louston to the War Department.
The names of three men in the middle
west have been talked about since the
esignation of Secretary Garrison. They

BRANDOS' METHODS
TARGET OF ATTACKS
Supreme Court Nominee Accused
of Unprofessional Conduct
by Boston Men.
SHOE MACHINERY CASE
CITED AS ONE EXAMPLE
Connection With Warren Will Ca?e
Also Aired Before Senate
Subcommittee.
Louis D. Brandeis of Boston
President Wilson's nominee foi
the Supreme Court bench, was attacked
today before the Senate
subcommittee investigating his
qualifications by Samuel W,
:J?. .1,. TT?:??,5
WIIISIUW, prCMUCUL U1 uic unuvu
Shoe Machinery Company, oi
which Mr. Brandeis was formerly
a director and counsel, and by
Hollis R. Bailey, a Boston attorney,
with whom Mr. Brandeis
had been associated years ago in
litigation over an estate.
Mr. Winslow charged that Mr. Brandeis
had been guilty of unprofessional
conduct in that after leaving the shoe
machinery company he had used knowledge
gained through his association with
it to attack as illegal and criminal "the
very acts and system of business which
he assisted to create and which he advised
were legal."
Charges of Mr. Bailey.
Mr. Bailey charged that Mr. Brandeis,
representing at the same time the
lessees and lessors of the Warren paper
mills, and involving a $21,000,000
estate, had been guilty of acts which
favored one set of interests against
the other.
The possibility of extending the inquiry
into New Haven railroad affairs
by testimony of Charles S. Mellon,
president of the road, was practically
passed over on receipt of a telegram
from Mr. Mellen saying he had no evi'
dence on Charles W. Barron's charge
that Mr. Brandeis had helped an attempt
to "wreck the New Haven road."
The committee may consider whether
to call Mr. Mellen later and make some
further inquiries of hint.
When the hearing: on the nomination
waf resumed todpy Senator Walsh
this telegrram from Mr. .Mell<?n:
"I have no information of any character
that, would. be. of any value t$ the
Subcommittee on the Brandeis nomination.
I have no papers that have
any bearing on. the case. Under the circumstances,
may I not.be Excused from
attending:?"
Wire to Mr. Mellen.
Senator Walsh said that in the absence
of Chairman Chilton he wired
Mr. Mellen:
"Mr. Barron, testifying: before judiciary
committee Thursday, asserted
you could testify to racts establishing
the charge that Brandeis was employed
to wreck the New Haven road.
Having in mind your telegram of today,
please wire whether you can give
committee any information that will
shed light on truth or falsity of the
charge."
To that Senator Walsh received another
message from Mr. Mellen reiterating
that he had no information whatever
on the subject.
After some discussion today the committee
decided to leave open the question
of whether Mr. Mellen should be
subpenaed.
Senator Clark said he had supposed
Mr. Brandeis was quite familiar with
1 affairs of the New Haven road and also
that he had read statements from Mr.
Mellen, "assailing Mr. Brandeis in most
violent terms, so violent that 1 did not
see how they could be true."
Tells of Warren Will Case.
IS: W. Winslow. president of the
United Shoe Machinery Company, was
| called as the first wrtness, but yielded
, to Hollis R. Bailey. Boston attorney,
who gave testimony relative to Mr.
Brandeis' connection with the so-called
Warren will case.
Mr. Bailey first made a general statement
that he had been opposed to Mr.
Brarideis in several law cases, but considered
their relations friendly. Mr.
, j Brandeis assisted his partner. Samuel
D. Warren, in framing a plan, which,
; Bailey said, placed his partner in a
: position individually antagonistic to
Warren's position as trustee.
"This," said Bailey, "as I shall call
attention to later, resulted in a breach
of trust. Mr. Brarideis and his firm
" acted for fifteen or twenty years as
counsel for Mr. Warren and associates
as trustees under an annual retainer
of $2,000, and for Mr. Warren and other
individuals as lessors of property under
a retainer. These interests were antagonistic
in some important particu
o, auu iiic icouit n ao inai llic UCIICficiaries,
one of whom was my client,
suffered financial damage in the sum
of some hundreds of thousands of dollars."
Formed a Partnership.
Bailey explained that S. D. Warren,
"jr., and Mr. Brarideis were in college
together ami later formed a law partnership.

MAY MODIFY THE RULES

Treatment of Neutrals Considered
by Britain Following Receipt
of B. S. Notes.
LONDON, February 15.?Consideration
of the question of the treatment
of neutral shippers raised by the
I American notes to Great Britain has
| reached an advanced stage, with the
I prospect of important modifications
designed to benefit the status of neutral
shippers, and which, it is .believed,
will give satisfaction to those who are
making the chief complaint, it has
been learned by the Associated Press.
Rule Under Present System.
Under the present system when cargoes
of perishable goods are seized
the goods are sold and the proceeds
afterward returned to the shipper in
case he establishes the bona fide character
of the shipment.
But deductions are made from the
proceeds so that the shipper pays the
expense of aecention. port dues, demurrage.
etc.. and the amount returned to
j the shipper is thus eaten up by charges
i notwithstanding that the bona fide
character of the shipment has been
established.
Will Protect Shippers.
The new principle under consideration
and likely to be applied will protect
neutral shippers from charges and
iii case the cargoes are detained or
subjected to loss the shipper will b?
given an idemnity.
