CHICAGO, Feb. 14.—Search for al
leged accomplices of Jean orones,
central figure in the "poisoned soup
anarchist plot" spread to New York
today.
Detective Chief Hunt this afternoon
said he had asked New York police
to arrest Domlnick Fortes, who was
Crones' room-mate, where enough
poison was found to kilt a regiment
and enough explosives to wrecK a sky
scraper. Despite the plea of Alle
grlnl's counsel for lower bonds, his
ball was set at $25,000 on each of the
two counts on which he is held, at
tempted murder and conspiracy to
murder, and he was taken back to
jail.
Allegrinl protested that letters
found In ^.is apartment indicating a
nation wide plot against prominent
churchmen-and church: property were
sent to Crones' room-mate. Only three
of the letters belonged to Allegrinl,
the prisoner said.
One of the letters, translated to
day, indicated, said the police, a plot
to blow up the state penitentiary at
Joliet.
This letter said:
"There are many men penned like
dogs In Joliet. What a wonderful
thing if we could free them. It would
be hard. is there you know."
Discovery of this letter, along with
floor plans of some of the largest sky
scrapers and churches in Chicago,
wuich police believed were listed as
victims of a campaign of destruction,
furnished the evidence on which Alle
grinl is held, authorities said.
Search for Crones was nation wide
today. Rumors that he had been
captured, were received from several
points, but none was verified. A
Minneapolis dispatch said a mysteri
ous informant phoned police tho loca
tion of the house In which Crones
and Mrs. Sophie Bresci were believed
to be living. Mrs. Bresci is the widow
of the assassin of King Humbert of

Louisiana, broke early today. The
flood waters are pouring through a
huge crevasse.
Thousands of acres are being

The break is the most serious since

however, any lives will be lost, for
warnings during the past few weeks

Federal authorities here and at
New Orleans have organized relief

Government engineers here said all

[By Carl W. Ackerman, United Press
Staff Correspondent]
BERLIN, (via Amsterdam) Feb. 15,
—The Lusitania settlement has sud
denly become the center of violent
party storms in Germany.
The newspapers today attacked
Chancellor Von Bethmann-Hollweg
and Foreign Secretary Von Jagow
with unprecedented vigor for falling
to explain the terms of settlement in
the Prussian house of commons. They
declared that the public should be
permitted to know whether Germany
has made any further concessions,
tending to cripple her submarine com
manders.
Party leaders who are anxious to
preserve the good relations existing
between Germany and the United
States, however, are delighted with
unofficial reports of the nature of
settlement. They consider that neith
er Germany nor the United States
has emerged triumphant from the
negotiations. They beiieved the very
fact that both nations have made
concussions in tne interest of har
mony makes the Lusitania agreement
of more gratifying noture than would
have been the case if one country
had yielded all.
An important phase of the political
controversy 1« the fact tnat the con
servatives, hitherto the government's
supporters, are now the strongest
opponents. The radicals are support
ing the government.
In the party clash, the Lusitania
affair haa been merged with discus
sion of tho disposition Germany is to
make of Belgium after the war. Con
servatives, who desire annexation of
Belgium on account of its fine har
bors and. its deposits .of iron ore, are
extremely bitter because of opposition
of radicals to the annexation program
and are carrying this feeling into the
Lusitania fight.
The chancellor, however. Is expect
ed to emerge victorious, the govern
ment having won unanimous support
in all recent declarations of policy
regarding submarine and Zeppelin
warfare.
When the Lusitania settlement la
definitely in the background, an un
precedented military campaign is pre
dicted.
