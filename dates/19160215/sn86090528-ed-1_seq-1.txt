(United Press Correspondence.)
PETROGRAD, Jan. 20. (By Mail.)
winning their
same autocratic Russia that abolished
Vodka in a night will think twice about
equal suffrage after the war, it became
known today. Inquiry in official cir
cles tends to the belief that there is
an overwhelming sentiment for re
warding the Russian women, at least
those of the educated classes, for their
valorous conduct under the guns.
The foig war has brought the Rus
sian woman to the fore. The tradition
al comradeship of Russian brothers
and sisters in home life, the co-educational
facilities of Russian universities,
the capabilities of Russian women gen
erally have all combined to give the
female subjects of the czar a mascu
line mentality. lb took the war to
change this to military feminism
which already bas demonstrated that
the upper classes of Russian women.
J are ready to vote.
The Russian woman's argument for
suffrage is silent. It Is not based
on street parades and flapping ban
ners, as in America, or more violent
demonstrations, as in England, bu:
on a record ct patriotic devotion and
heroics on the battle front. The im
itary regulations of the czar's forces
on land and sea decree that no women
may serve. These regulations are not
obeyed. Accounts of femala heroism
come from every Russian battle front.
Everywhere Russiqn women are in
the midst oflthe struggle. Some of
the mobt blood soaked Russian battle
fields are stained with feminine blood.
Base and field hospitals find count
less nursing sisters. But it is the
fighting sister in the ranks that has
thrilled Russia during the last eigh
teen months. The reports of bravery
of the nursing sisters is a secondary
chapter. The devotion ol the lowliest
peasant woman to war work is an
other. Here Is the latest list ot femi
nine heroism, fresh from the front.
Mile. Kokovtseva, decorated with
Hie St. George's cross for daring re-
connaisance work, though wounded.
She was a "cossack."
Mllo. Appoltvia Islatev, changed her
name to become a common soldier
in the regiment of her father. She
carried him, dangerously wounded.
from a burring cottage to the rear.
Mile. Maria Bieloverskala, a private,
saw the major of her battalion fall
during a brush with the enemy. She
carried him to a place of safety. She
wears the St. Ceorge's cross ot the
Third and Fourth class.
Mile. Olga Schidlowskaia joined tho
Hussars as "Oleg Schidlowsky after
her two brothers were killed at'Sol
dau. She clipped her hair short. Sh
will be decorated for valor.
Mile. Olga Pietrowski seized her
colonel's sword after he fell, rallied
the regiment and took an Austriau
trenches before falling mortalb bound
ed. Such acts of feminine heroism have
been reported daily for months. Hos
pitals throughout the empire all have
their "Amazon" wounded. . There Is
ro surprise when a wounded soldier in
hospital proves to be a female. Be
hind every wound ia a story.
In most cases it Is an extraordinary
f,tory. These stories are common now
in Russ'u. 'There are in Petrograd hos
pitals alone today more than 20 wound
ed Russian girls. Halt of them w-ere
students before they joined the army.
