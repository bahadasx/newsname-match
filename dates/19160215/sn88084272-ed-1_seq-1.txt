Constantinople, Turkey, Feb. 15.
One of tho most serious mistakes of
the allies was the contempt with which
they treated the German aviators dur
ing the first stages of the war. From
tho fact that French flyers had created
a number of sport records, the French
and English press drew the conclusion
that Germany was hopelessly out
classed In the air. The people or the
allied and the neutral countries were
made to believe that the air was as
completely dominated by the French, as
the seas by the English.
This dream was of short duration,
however. By September, 1914, tho Lon
don "Times" had to concede that the
successes of the Germans on the west
ern front were largely due to tho ex
cellent scouting service of their avi
ators. When Turkey entered tho war. the
Constantinople papers expressed fear
that the supremacy of the French and
.ngiish aviators would bring disaster
to the Turkish armies. The Turks at
that time only possessed four flyers.
who were trained in Germany and used
antiquated machines of French origin.
The ImposMblle Ii Donet
The creation of a respectable Turkish
air fleet seemed almost Impossible. The
arsenals began at once the construction
of aeroplanes, but many parts of them
could not be produced In Turkey and
had to bo brought from Germany and
Austria-Hungary. About a dozen ma
chines were built In Germany and de
livered in Constantinople, but before
they could be used, pilots had to be
trained for them.

chanics to take charge of the organiza

large aeroplane xactory was erected at
San Stefano under the direction of Capt
Sorno and within three months this
energetic young officer has created an
efficient air fleet out of practically
nothing.
Soon a Hundred Machines.
In March the Turkish army had over
100 flying mcahlnes and their number
has been growing steadily ever since;
The Turkish officers selected as avi
ators surprised their German teachers.
They went into their work enthusiastically-and
with tho greatest daring.
AH of them mastered the secrets of
aviation In a very short time.
At first the Turkish airmen were
only used to reconnolter the positions
oi ine aines on tne peninsula or ualll
poll, but they soon flew far out over
the Aegean sea and tho islands of
Lemnos, Imbros and Mytllene to ob
serve the movements of the French
and English warships and transports.
Attack and Sink Iloatn.
Later they began to attack. They
destroyed seven or eight English and
French aeroplanes on Galllpoll and In
tho Dardanelles and almost daily
throw bombs on the ships of tho allies.
One small English cruiser was sunk by
them and 146 men of the crew were
killed.
Since last fall, the Turkish aviators
have also been trery active In the Cau
casus, In Mesopotamia and along the
Suez canal. In December thev hroueht
down five British machines north of
Kut-el-Amara. Four of the aeroplanes
captured In Mesopotamia were repaired
by the Turkish aviators and are now
used against the enemy.
Although hardly a year old the Turk

and highly efficient- The number of
flyors lias been increased to more than
EOO.

Want a Gold Mine?
Richer Than Solomon's?
Read Next Week-End Herald
GOLD fabulous in quantity lies in the mountains of Xew Mexico, In
Socorro county, not far from El Paso. It is said to bae always
been guarded by indians who shoot every prospector who attempts
to make his way to the place. The mines of Solomon were as nothing tom
pared to the richness of .these New Mexico mines. The Klondike lode is a
piker beside the Adams "diRgins." Men have hunted for years for these
mines. Indians tell their papooses of the wonderful rkhes off there in the
hills. Men have gone in after the gold and have never been seen again at
least that is the story.
It is a wonderful, weird story, this tale of "the Adams Diggins." It
reads like fiction, yet it has the ring of truth. Everybody has heard of the
Adams "diggins"; it is a part of the mining lore of 'ew Mexico. Tho
Herald has secured the story from a man who got it from Adams himself;
from a man who put up money to help search for the lost treasure house so
rich, according to tradition, that indians made bullets of the gold and a
horse could be loaded with pure gold nuggets in a day. W. H. Byerts, a
New Mexico banker, tells the story as Adams told it to him; he gives direc
tions as Adams gave them to him, and says the world is welcome to go and
search. He says he believes in the existence of these mines and is willing
to furnish maps wnd drawings to help locate them. Ha asks nothing in re
turn. He beliees these mines exist and he gives the public whnt he knows
about them. It is a thrilling story, whether you want to hunt for the mines
or not. If you want to locate the Adams "diggins" then it will interest
you more.
