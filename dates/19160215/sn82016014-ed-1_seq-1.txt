the ideals and aspirations of the Ro

Stone's address, in part, follows:
Rotary hfis no more business with

Paris, Feb. 15. An appropriation
of 7,817.000,000 francs for the sec
ond quarter of 1916 is provided in a
bill introduced in the chamber of dep
uties today by Alexandre Ribot, min
ister of finance. Of this, all but 657

According to ngures furnished by
Finance Minister Ribot, the French
government expects to spend daily for
war purposes during April, May and
June a sum which in normal times
would be equivalent to $15,736,000.
The total appropriation for the first
quarter of 1916 amounted to 8.172,
000,000 francs. lut just what propor
tion was for military purposes was not
stated, it is estimated that in the last
quarter of 1915 the expenditures of
the French government probably were
in excess of $13,000,000 a day.

SPRING WEATHER HERE
Indications That the Temperature Will
Continue to Kise.
Real spring weather is the program
for today and tomorrow at Topeka.
The bill calls for continued fair weath
er. Prospects for losing all of the
ice that remains on the ground were
good this morning. The Kaw river
fell three-tenths of a foot since Mon
day. The ice is on the river but there
is practically no danger of a jam. The
wind is in the northwest, but seems to
have little effect on the temperature.
The forecast calls for fair weather
tonight and Wednesday: moderate
temperatures. The minimum at To
peka tonight will be between 25 and
30 degrees. The shippers forecast in
dicates 25 degree temperatures for 36
hour shipments north and west; east
and south, 25 to 30 degrees. Tomor
row afternoon will be just as warm
and possibly warmer than today, ac
cording to S. D. Flora, local weather
observer.
The lowest temperature of the twenty-four
hours occurred during the
hour from 7 to 8 oclock, when the
reading was 26 degrees. This is 13 de
grees hierher than on Monday morn
ing, and is 6 degrees above normal for
the date.
The wind is blowing at the rate of
8 miles an hour. This morning the
Kaw river showed a stage of 7.5 feet.
The river is falling after a rise ex
tending over several days, probably
due to the melting snow and ice.
Temperatures today averaged 2 de
gress above normal. Following are

A gardener on the McCormick es
tate, of which Orpet's father is care
taker, is said to have admitted putting
the poison in the aah heap. This was
explained by the elder Orpet by the
statement that the poison had been
used to kill insects on shrubbery but
its inferior quality had rendered it
useless. State's Attorney Dady of
Lake county said today he regarded
the discovery of the poison and tho
clerk who sold the bottle as the last
link in the chain of circumstantial
evidence by which he expects to con

Petrograd. Feb. 15. Russian womea
are winning their emancipation on
the battlefield. The same autocratte
Russia that abolished vodka in a night
will think twice about equal suffrage
after the war, it became known to
day. Inquiry in official circles tends
to the belief that there is an over
whelming sentiment for rewarding th
Russian woman, at least those- of the
educated clasbeo, for their valorous
conduct under the guns.
The big war has brought the Rus
sian woman to the fore. The tradi
tional comradesnip of Russian broth
ers and sisters in home life, the cor
educational facilities of Russian uni
versities, the capabilities of Russian
women generally have ail combined
to give the female subjects of th czar
a masculine mentality. It took tha
war to change this to military femi
nism which already has demonstrated
that the upper classes of Russian'
women are ready for the vote.
The Russian woman's argument for'
sutirage is silent. It is not based on
street parades and flapping banners,
as in America, or more violent demon
st rat ions, as in England, but on a rec
ord of patriotic devotion and heroics
on the battle front. The military reg
ulations of the czar's forces on land
and sea decree that no woman may
serve. These regulations are not
obeyed. Accounts cf female heroism
come from every Russian battlo front.

Natchez, Feb. 15. Two breaks oc
curred early today in the Mississippi
levee at Limerick plantation, about 25
miles above St. Joseph, La, and six
miles from Newellton, on the Louisi

here.
It was stated that a large volume
of water was rushing through the
breaks and would flood Tensas, Con

Natchez. Miss.. Feb. 1 6. The re
port of the break was received here
by W. C. Barton, one of the govern
ment engineers in charge of levees
in this district, who later started for
the crevices. Mr. Barton said the
warnings were sent by telephone and
by couriers on horseback to the sec
tion In the path of the flood and he
believed the inhabitants would have
time to escape.
Many thousands of acres would ba
inundated, he said, and among the
towns which may be flooded or sur
rounded by the onrushing waters art
Newellton, St. Joseph. Vidalla, Water-
proof and Ferriday. According to
Mr. Barton's advices, the crevasse oc
curred in the basin of Lake 8t. Jos
eph and he thought the high bankw
of the lake probably would hold back
the water for a time and enable resi
dents on the plantations to reach
places of safety.
The back levee around the town of
St. Joseph, he said, might protect the
place from inundation.
Memph's, Feb 15. A long distance
telephone message received here from
Natchez, Miss., says the main levee 33
miles below that city broke early to
day. Tho water from this break will
flood a i. rge area of rich farming1
