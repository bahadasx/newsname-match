JAPANESE CRUISERS TO
BRING CARGO GOLD
In Connection With Furnishing Muni'
tions to Russia.
Tokio. Japan. Jan. 12 (Correspond
ence of The Associated Press). Huge
financial international transactions are
being carried out through the trans
portation of gold on the Japanese
cruisers Kiwa and Chitose, which will
soon sail for the United States on a
financial mission connected "with fur
nishing war supplies to Russia.
Great Britain owed a gold specie
balance to Japan, and it was decided,
owing to the danger of the despatch of
gold by sea, to ask Russia to send the
necessary specie to Japan and credit
Russia with a similar amount in Lon
don. With infinite precaution the gold
was conveyed from Petrograd to
Vladivostok, where the Japanese cruis
ers, heavily guarded, were waiting and
whence they sailed with their burden
to Maizuru. At the same time and
by the same means Russia forwarded
to Japan a great quantity of silver in
gots destined for the Japanese national
mint at Osaka, where, under the direc
tion of Russian experts, they will be
made into Russian sliver coins for cir
culation in the Russian empire. The
gold specie importation was estimated
at 20,0(10,000 yen, or $10,000,000.
According to information at Tokio,
the forthcoming voyage of the Tokiwa
and Chitose to the United States or
Canada is for the purpose of transport
ing gold specie in behalf of Russia
and the embarkation in America of
quantities of material for the manu
facture of war supplies. The idea is
to hasten the turning out of supplies
by Japan so that Russia may be fully
furnished with munitions by the spring
or summer.
PASTEURIZATION OR
STERILIZATION OF MILK.
A More Careful Supervision Recom
mended in Massachusetts.
Boston, Feb. 14. A more careful
supervision of milk, its pasteurization
or sterilization and the extention of
the dairy laws of this state were advo
cated by a special milk board in a re
port to the state department of health
made today after an eight months' ni
vestigation. The board held out no
hope for cheaper milk, but declared
that Massachusetts dairymen must
produce milk of a superior quality in
order to hold their patronage in this
state.
The standards in Massachusetts, the
board stated, were found to be below
those in New York, but higher than
in New Hampshire, . Vermont and
Rhode Island. A state label for Mas
sachusetts milk was suggested as well
as the grading of all milk.
It is expected that the report will
be used in formulating a bill for
presentation to the legislature now in
session.

the existence of a gang of fifteen an
archists whose grudge lay principally
against the church and churchmen. He
said that he had the names of most
of the members and that detectives
have been instructed to search for
them.
Captain Hunt named Frank Allegri
ni, in whose rooms anarchistic let
ters and literature was found, as one
of the men. The names of the alleg
ed anarchists are said to have Viecn
taken from these letters.
They were written in 19 IS and are
si'd .to disclose a widespread p;ot,
extending to Rome, Italy, to destroy
churches and church property of all
creedE. According to Detectiv? Ser
geant Paul Riccio, who ailed in
translating the letters, from the Kalian
in which thep were written, the head
quarters of the society was in Rome.
Efforts were made, it was said, to
ovgazs branches of the society all
over the world. In the Unitad States
public buildings were to receive the
attention of the anarchists in addi
tion to the churches. Most of the
litters were without signatures.

Advised Care With Pats.
The second letter mentioned the re
ceipt of a letter from Allegrini. "I re
ceived your letter and am glad you
are taking interest," it said. "But I
will recommend you to be careful with
your pals because there may be some
traitors among them wno cannot tell
a lie to foo Justice." The third ki
ts? said:

"I have sent vour trunk. Things

the first time to the use of his . name
as a presidential candidate in the
