EFFORT TO DELAY
BUILDING OF HEAT
PLANT IS DEFEATED
House Decrees That Plans
Need Not Be Submitted to
Fine Arts Body.
ELECTRIC CO. IS CRITICISED
Fitzgerald Scores Publio Utility
Corporation For Opposition
to the Enterprise.
By adopting the partial conference re
port on the urgent deficiency bUL the
House 'today decreed that the construe
tlon of the central light, heat and power
plant for the Government departments
shall proceed without tho submission
of plane to the Fine Art Commission.
Thla action vu taken after Congress
man Fitsgerald had virtually charged
that the opposition to the plan was
inspired y local electric light Inter
ests. In accepting the conference report, tho
House finally kills the Newlands amend,
ment to hold up construction of the
plant This amendment was rejected
by tho Senate yesterday.
Suggests Opposition SourctC
Congressman .Fitzgerald, chairman of
the Appropriations Committee, said the
first protest he had heard about the
central plant came from the Potomac
Elcctrld Power Company. Soon there
after, he said, members of Congress
were flooded with telegrams from archi
tects protesting against tho erection of
the plant
"There have been some peculiar co
incidences in connection with the op
position of the local electric llnht com
pany,' said Mr. Fltagerald. "These cot
Incidences have not added to the xorce
of the opposition .galnst this plant"
On yesterday the (Senate eliminated
the Newlands amendment) to the urgent
deficiency bill, which was designed to
hold uo construction of the plant until
tho Fine Arts Commission and tho
lreldent had approved of the plans.
When the matter camo before the House
today Congressman Cooper of Wiscon
sin became tho principal champion of
the movement to delay construction,
and Insisted that the proposed plant
would mar the beauty of the city. .
"What I want to know." aad Mr.
Cooper, "Is why tho plnne for .this plant
And Its smokestacks were not sub
mitted to the Fine Arts Commission?"
I, " plant was authorized In 1512, there was
In effect n exe-ullVe order by Presi
dent Taft, rcqtirjng that all plan? for

m It ted to tho ntie Arts Commission
President "Wilson Inter, modified that
order by Instruction that the plans
Bhould be submitted to the arts com
mission If the building "would affect
In any way the appearance' of the
city.' ,r
Congressman Fitzgerald said Congress
had specifically authorized construc
tion of the plant at a certain site, and
thin superceded nny exocutlve order.
Mr. Cooper laid Mr. Fitzgerald had
left tho Impression that tho Potomao
Electric Power Company "was boosting
tho fight against thi plant" According
to Mr. cooper, woionei Maris ana uass
Gilbert, member of the American Insti
tute of Architects, first called this at
tention to tho fact that the smoke
stacks of the plant would disfigure
Washington.
Criticises Architects.
Congressman Fitzgerald said the
president of the American Institute, of
Architects "cojld not tell me within
fifty feet the netght of these smoke
stacks, about which the architects were
so loudly protesting," Tho central plant,
Mr. Fitzgerald said, would eliminate
seven smokestacks In Washington.
Congressmen Fitzgorald and Campbell
agreed thnt the location of tho new
filant would add to rather than de
root from tho attractiveness of that
part of the city, that Is, the slto near
tthe Bureau of Engraving and Printing
building. Chairman Fitzgerald further
asserted that the Potomac Company
had an opportunity to mako loner bids
for furnishing heat and light to the
Government, but their' bids convinced
the Treasury Department It would bo
economical to build a Government plant.

"He asked particularly that until tho

"The President's letter, however., per
mitting the use of his name on the

nouncement as Mr. Bryan had In minu.
"Tho fact that the nomination ot

vitally related to the public welfare,

The Post's correspondent stated, how
ever, that Bryan's opposition will bo
based on more than technical grounds:
that the President's approval , of pro
paredness measures "and many other,

ammunition. .

Bryan Is .further quoted as having
made the following assertion In h

Bryan belloves, according to the cor

50 TOWNS
Waters Pour Through Mile-Wide
Crevasse Twenty-five Miles
North of St. Joseph.
NATCHEZ. Miss.. Feb. 15. The main
Mississippi river levee, about twenty-five
miles above St. Joseph, Miss., broko
early today.
The flood waters are pouting through
a h(ge crevasse.
Thousands of acres aro being flooded.
Tho gap iaa wldoned to a mile, and
huntHreds'dt-Treons' are making their
wayMo the, titan lands. Parlsher bf
Tenasns, Concordia, Madison. Franklin,
and Catahoula will be flooded.
Fifty towns will be overflowed.
The break Is the most serious since
the flood stage was reached In this
vicinity. It Is feared the towns ot
SL Joseph, Waterproof, and Newell
ton, will bo flooded. It Is hoped
there will be no loss of life as warn
ings during; the past few week- have
caused an exodus of! Inhabitants.
Federal authorities hero and at New
Orleans have organized relief parties
which will depart for St. Joseph, La,,
this afternoon.
Government engineers said all of
Tenasas and Concordia parishes will
be entirely submerged In a few days.
They said hundreds of square miles
of rich farming lands In thla region
are being Inundated.
Phenomenal Orders
Booked by U.S. Steel
Indication That Corporation Has
Sold Nearly All It Can
Produce in 1016.
NEW YORK. Feb. IB. It Is under
stood that since February 1 the lnld
States Steel . Corporation subsidiaries
have booked; orders for Approximately
1.000,000 tons of rolled steel.
This Is 400.000 tons In excess of pro
ductive capacity of the rolling mills. In
dicating that tho-unfilled orders teday
amount to nearly 8,400,000 tons, tho
largest In the history of the corporation.
In addition It Is estimated that Inter
company business amounting to 2.000,
000 tons must bo taken care of. In or
dinary times, when tho corporation was
utilising only 60 to 60 pet cent of plant
capacity., intercompany busines- was tn
excess of 1.000,000 tons. In considering
the possibility of shipments on current
business It Is necessary to take these
Intercompany orders Into account.
Consequently the backlog on -the
boolfs of tho subsidiary companies to
day Is equivalent to the output of the
mills for nine months. Making omo al
lowance for current business, the Indi
cation Is that the corporation hnn small
productive capacity unsold for 1918.
This Is phenomenal, a situation without
a parallel in trade history.

Dr. MacMurray, wbp Is pastor of the
TTnlnn Mothnrftat Church In Twentieth
street, made his allegation while testi
fying oerore tno suocomnuweo nt wio
District Committee Inquiring Into Uw
fitness of General Smith for reappoint
ment as chairman of the board. Hta
testimony created a sensation.
Senator Sheppard, of Texas, by sskln
nueatlon offered the accusing tnuxtStM'
an opportunity to amend his statesaBt
and mako It apply only to secretary
Tumulty, but Dr. MaoMurray ia, nt
mean -the President of tho Unlte4
States' '
Clergyman's Testimony.
Dr. MacMurray's entire testimony
dealt largely with President WnsoB.
Secretary Tumuly, Jersey City politics,
and the domination of General Smith by
tho White House In deciding applica
tions for liquor licenses in the District.
After asserting that General Smith "la
not temperamentally fitted to be chair
man of tha .Excise Board nor has he
had the training which would qualify
him for such an office," Dr. MacMurray
said:
"Having taken orders nil his life, it is
but natural that a man trained.. loolc
to others to take the Initiative will con
tinue to do so when ho receives an Im
portant position late In life. General
Smith lacks Initiative, and. Is still taklat;
orders from, semo onir .

"To dn that would renulro that we
go Into history," said the minister. "For
soma years 1 was pastor or a cnuren fc
In Jersey City. Tho Secretary to the 9
President, and It Is not necessary to
call his name, was affiliated with the
Bob Davis branch of the Democratic
party. The Secretary to tho President
was a nrotcgo of the Bob Davis branch.

throughout the country.

"Now, the President makes appoint- ,,
mtnts, bvtt the President's Secretary haa"
something to do with those appoint
ments. Here' . r.ian looking for & Job.
Here's another man, Secretary to the
President, who la friendly to the liquor
traffic or who has never manifested
any unfriendliness toward it.
"The Secretary wantn someone ap
pointed to this place who will be
solicitous or his views and wishes. He
suggest this man out of a Job and
the appointment Is made."
"Are you giving us knowledge or
surnrlsoT" asked bonator Phelan.
"Thl Is surmlso based on certain
hnown deflnlto facts and which leads
to a logical conclusion" replied the
minister. "DO you ruppose the Secre
tary to the I'rmtdent would represent
the liquor Interests In Jersey for years
and then overlook the opporunlty to
brlpg about tho appointment of a.
man faorabla to tho liquor Interests)

Matter of Knowledge.
"A lawyer, after all. Is only a hired
advocate," said Senator Phelan. "$fe
m&y represent a man without being
In sympathy .with that man's cause."
"The .Secretary to the President has
never put himself on record as being;
unfriendly to the Interests he repre
sented In Jersey," snld tho minister.
"Senator Hoot has been attorney for
some blf trusts, would you say ho
was in sympathy with tJajstsT' asked
Henator Phelan.
"Well, I would say as a matter of
knowledge that Senator Root's ap
puarlng for the trusts has made tt
very embaiasslng for him on o nusi
bor of occasions," suld Dr. MacMur
rav. "Ho criticised the, political bosses in
New orlc the other day," said Sen-'
ator Phelan.
"Yes, hut those bosses were not o(
his political shading," responded tho
minister.
Dictum of Teacher.
Continuing his discussion of Seere
tary Tumulty's connection with the
liquor traffic In New Jersey, Dr. Mao
Murray said:
"A man In tho plastlo period of his
life cannot advocate a cause for long
without being affected by that advocacy
and his views xhaped accordingly. I
hope the Secretary to tho President
Is opposed to tho liquor traffic, but he
has not said anything to that effect.
I think he rhould be, and I hope ho
will be, nnd I know what I am talking
about when I say that." .
"President Wilson comes from New
Jersey and General Smith comes from
New Jorsey. Do you wish to say here
that tho Congressional delegation of
tho Btatd used Its influence for General
Smith's appointment?" asked Senator
Phelan.
In reply. Dr. MacMurray said ho knew
President Wilson personally, having
left Princeton Just 11 year' before Prof.
Wilson took charge of the history close
and having kept In closo touch with
the university.
"I havo studied his books," he con
