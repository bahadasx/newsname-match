the change. lie contended thnt
politics should have nothing to
do with the matter and said that |
the number of Courts are in-1
creasing because the State is'
growing larger and litigation is'

Referring to the opposition of |
The News and Coiirer to the
creation of this circuit, the
Charleston Senator said that he;
believed the opposition was based
on conscientious motives, but
that the editor had been miss'cd,
and Senator Sinkler did not
think that the editor was in pos-i
session of the facts from alii
sides. He paid a tribute to the
editor of the News and Courier)
and said thnt he felt that the:
editor's actions had been dictat.
