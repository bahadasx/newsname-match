Review of War Situation.
It is announced semi-offlcially in
Paris that despite the great activity
of theGermans on the western front,
the attacks in question are in reality
only local actions without gains of
significance. It is declared that the
French could easily undertake similar
actions but are refraining from doing
so 'because the results are not worth
the price that has to be paid
German news sources report great
damage to the French fortress of Bel
fort in the recent shelling by long
range German guns.
Austrian aircraft have raided Mon
za, ten miles northeast of Milan, one
person being killed and five injured
by bombs dropped. Airmen also drop
ped bombs on the Italian town of
Schio. killing six persons.

likely that an Income tax will be im

BREACH OF TRUST
Brandeis Acts as Attorney for
Lessees and Beneficiaries
and Hundreds of Thou
sands of Dollars Are
Involved.
Washington, Feb. 15. Charles S.
Mellen, former president of the New
Haven railroad, today notified the
senate sub-committee investigating of
nomination of Louis D. Brandeis of
Boston for the supreme court bench,
that he had no facts to substantiate
the charge by C. W. Barron 'of Boston
that Mr. Brandeis "had helped wreck
the New Haven."
Representatives of the United Shoe
Machinery company, with" which Mr.
Brandeis formerly was associated, ap
peared as witnesses.
Telegram From Mellen.
When the hearing on the nomina
tion was resumed today, Senator
Walsh read this telegram from Mr.
Mellen:
"I have no Information of any char
acter whatever that would be of any
value to the sub-committee on the
Brandeis nomination. I have posi
tively no bearing on the case. Under
these circumstances may I not be ex
cused from attending?"
Senator Walsh said that, in the ab
sence of Chairman Chilton, he wired
Mr. Mellen:
"Mr. Barron testifying before judi
ciarv committee Thursday asserted
vou" would testify to facts establish
ing the charge that Brandeis was em
ployed to wreck the New Haven road.
Having In mind your telegram of to
daj, please wire whether you can give
committee any information that will
shed light on truth or falsity of the
charge?"
To that Senator Walsh received an
other message from Mr. Mellen relt
r.rntinrr that, ho had no information
whatever on tho subject.
After some discussion today, the
committee decided to leave open the
question of whether Mr. Mellen
should be subpoenaed.
Boston Attorney Testifies.
S. W. Winslow. president of the
United Shoe Machinery company, was
called as the first witness, but yielded
to Hollls R Bailey. Boston attorney,
who gave testimony relative to Mr
Brandeis' connection with the so-call-eu
Warren will case.
Mr. Bailey first made a general
statement that he had been opposed
to Mr Brandeis in several law cases,
but considered their relations friend
ly Mr. Brandeis assisted his partner,
Samuel D. Warren. In framing a plan
which, Bailey said, placed his part
ner in a position Individually antag
onistic to Warren's position as trus
tee "This," said Bailey, "as I shall
call attention to later, resulted In a.
breach of trust. Mr. Brandeis and
his firm acted for 15 or 20 years as
counsel for Mr. Warren and asso
dates as trustees under an annual
ictalner of $2000 and for Mr Warren
and other individuals as lessors ot
property under a reUlner. These in
terests were antagonistic in some im
portant particulars and the result was
that tho beneficiaries, one of hom
yras my client, suffered fl"ancJalHclcam:
age in the sum of some hundreds or
thousands of dollars "
Bailey Explains Warren Case.
Bailey explained that S. D. Warren,
Jr, and Mr. Brandeis were in col
lege together and later formed a law
partnership. Warren was the son of
Samuel D. Warren, Sr., a paper man
ufacturer, who left an estate of $21,
000,000 to his widow and five chil
dren, one of whom, Edward Warren,
Bailey's client, never was connected
with the paper business. A financial
arrangement was made for carrying
on the business
"First," said Mr. Bailey, "the widow
and all tho children convoyed all
thnir interests in the property,
through Mr. Brandeis as a third party,
to three trustees, S D Warren, Jr., a
Mr. Mason who had been associated
in a small way with the paper busi
ness, and Mrs. Warren, tho widow.
These trustees operated the paper
mills, the deed of trust directing that
they were to carry on the business
for the benefit of all the heirs.
Property Is Leased.
"What was done was that these
three lessees, by authority given In the
deed, made a lease of the property to
Mr. Brandeis and through him to S. D.
Warren, Fiske Warren, another son,
and Mason, who proceeded to oper
ate tho mill. The rental terms were
6 per cent interest on the property
and half the net profits. That ar
rangement resulted ln S. D. Warren
receiving compensation for his serv
ices In the first two or three years,
amounting to $75,000 to $100,000;
Fiske Warren from $30,000 to $40,000
nnd they, with Ma-oon, within 19 or 20
years received for their services ap
proximately $2,000,000. A bill of
equity was filed in the Massachusetts
courts alleging that this wag twice as
much aB could fairly be charged. It
appeared on the hearing that Mr.
Brandeis had acted as counsel for
ihe leseos and also for the lessors
and for many years had tho trust and
confidence of all tho beneficaries."
A suit growing out of dissatisfac
tion of some trustees was settled out
of court.
"It appeared," he continued, "that
as a provision in the lease by which
Warren personally with his associates
was bound to make repairs and that
Warren as trustee wasbound to make
additions or improvements, consider-
TO BE CHAIRMAN OF 1
G. O. P. COMMITTEE
' ggg? : l
Nicholas Longvrorth.
Congressman Nicholas Longworth,
of Cincinnati, is expected shortly to
announce his acceptance of an offer
to serve this year as chairman of the
national Republican congressional
committee. This will m mean, of
course, that he has decided not to
become a candidate for the Repub
lican senatorial nomination in Ohio.
able sums had been charged to the ad
ditions or improvements account that
should have been charged to the re
pair account. Our charge was that
Mr. Brandeis, as a lawyer for Mr.
Warren, who had ibout this time re
tired from the if... firm, was instru
mental ln making the plan for con
ducting the business; that he wrote
an opinion for the beneficiaries hold
ing that the plan was legal, protected
them from the individual liability as
partners and was a proper arrange
ments. Beneficiaries Employ Other Counsel.
"None of the beneficiaries had oth
er counsel until 1903 when Edward
Warren employed William S. Young
man with whom I became associated
about 1910. Mr. Brandeis, I think,
drew a will for Mrs. Warren and one
for Edward Warren.
"We contended that the lease to
Samuel D. Warren was not fair to the
beneficiaries and was one which was
regarded as being for his personal in
terests, rather than as to his duties
as trustee." .
Senator Fletcher brought out that
tho money derived by the lessors was
not salary but their share of the
earnings and was dependent upon
thPir successful operation ot the busi
ness. . t
Bailev testified that the heirs knew
the Brandeis firm was acting for les
sors and lessees, but did not know
how they were acting or advising. His
point was that when differences as
to the management arose about fif
teen years after the lease was made
regarding repairs, that the Brandeis
firm should have advised Edward
Warren to get independent counsel
"because tho firm represented both
sides." , . , ,
"I think if Mr Brandeis had prop
erlv considered the rights and inter
ests ot Edward Warren." Mr. Bailey
said, "that he would have said to him:
rYour brother Samuel, while trustee
of this property, is getting very large
sums under this lease.' "
Clark Stirs Up Tempest.
Senator Clark stirred up a tempest
in the committee by asking Bailey if
he were able to tell from his associa
tion with lawyers In Boston what was
the general professional reputation of
Mr Brandeis. Senator Walsh and
Senator Fletcher both objected to the
form of question, but Senator Cum
mins insisted it was highly proper
The committee finally consented to
let Mr. Bailey answer and ho gave
the answer that tho opinion of the
Boston bar was that Mr. Brandeis
was "a very able lawyer, a man of
keen Intellect, an able advocate, but
lhat he is not entirely trustworthy.
I think that Is about Its It.
"What aro vour politics? asked
Senator Clark, "A Wilson Democrat.'

Within a few minutes after the fire jj

it was again lowered to this level
there were no men at the landing. ,
William G. Mitchell, assistant foreman
