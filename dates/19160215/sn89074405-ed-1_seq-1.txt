Communication From Von Bernstorff

Are Nearer Each Other.
Berlin, via London, Feb. 16.—Ac
cording to brief statements in the
Lokal Anseiger and the Tageblatt, the
communication received Friday from
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador at Washington, gives
promise of an impending settlement
of the Lusltanla controversy, the Ger
man and American standpoints, it is
asserted, having been brought ma
terially nearer to each' other. The
Lokal Anseiger declares that the only
thing now necessary is to embody the
results of the negotiations in a new
note "after which the whole matter
may be regarded as settled."
The Tageblatt, more cautious, says
that an agreement has been reached
on the main point of issue, but that
probably some time will elapse before
a formula is definitely fixed.
The Associated Press is assured in
a high quarter that the situation is
very favorable, and that perhaps it
will be possible to conclude the ne

CO. CASE AIRED
Trusteeship in Will Case al
so Brought Forth in
Opposition.
Washington, Feb. 16.—That LouU
D. Brandies is guilty of Improper con
duct toward the United Shoe com
pany, is charged by 8. W. Wlnslow,
president of the company, before th6
senate sub-committee. He charged
that Brandies attacked as Illegal
acts, the methods of the company' in
which he had participated, and assist
ed to create.
Winslow's testimony followed the
charges made by Hollis Bailey, that
Brandies had arranged the trustee
ship of the $21,000,000 estate of Sam
uel Warren, the paper manufacturer,
so that three trustees, two of whom
were heirs of the estate, took down
approximately $2,000,000 in a twenty
year period. Bailey asserted this wee
to the detriment of interests of other
heirs of the Warren estate.
Washington, Feb. IB.—Charles S.
Mellen, former president of the New
Haven railroad, notified the senate
sub-committee investigating the nom
ination of Louis D. Brandeis of Boa
ton for the supreme court bench, that
New Haven road."
When the hearing on the nomina
tion wu resumed. Senator Walsh read
this telegram from Mellen:
"I have no information of any
character that would be of any value
to the sub-committee on the Brandela
nomination. 1 have no papers that
have any bearing on the case. Un
der these circumstances, may I not
be excused from attending?"
No Information.
Senator Walsh replied to this tele
gram asking specifically if Mellen held
any Information whatever bearing on
the Barron charge. To this Senator
Walsh received a second message from
Mellen, reiterating that Mellen had
absolutely no information whatever
on the subject.
After some discussion the commit
tee decided to leave open the question
of whether Mellen should be sub
poenaed.
Hollis R. Bailey, a Boston attorney,
then was called to the witness stand
and gave testimony relative to Bran
deis' connection with the so-called
Warren will case.
Explains Will Case.
In this connection Bailey said:
"A bill in equity yas filed in the
Massachusetts courts alleging that
this was twice as much as could be
fairly charged. It appeared on the
hearing that Mr. Brandeis had acted
as counsel for the lessees and also
for the lessors, and for many years
had the trust and confidence of the
beneficiaries."
Suit growing out of the dissatis
faction of some heirs. Bailey said,
was settled out of court.
"It appeared," he continued, "that
as a result of a provision in the lease
by which Warren personally, with his
associates, was bound to make re
pairs, and that Warren, as trustee,
was bound to make additions or im
provements, considerable sums had
been charged to the additions or im
provements account that should hava
been charged to the repair account.
Our charge was that Mr. Brandeis. as
a lawyer for Mr. Warren, was instru
mental in making the plans for con
ducting the business: that he wrote
an opinion for the beneficiaries hold
ing that the plan was legal, protected
them from the individual liability as
partners, and was a proper arrange
ment. None of the beneficiaries had
other counsel until
1903.
We contend
that the lease to Samuel D. Warren
was not fair to the beneficiaries, and
was one in which regard was had for
his personal Interests, rather than to
his duties as trustee."
