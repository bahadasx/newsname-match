Search for Missing Chef Who
Poisoned Soup at Banquet
Leads to Discovery,
WIDESPREAD PLOT
IS DISCOVERED
Intentions of Plotters Discovered
Through Letters Buildings
Were Marked.
Chicago, Feb. 14.—Captain Nicholas
Hunt, of the detective bureau, who is
directing the search for Jean Crones,
the missing assistant chef, who is sus­
pected of having poisoned the soup
served at a banquet to Archbishop
Mundelein, said tonight that the
search has developed the existence of
a gang of fifteen anarchists, whose
grudge lay, principally, against the
church and church men. Captain
Hunt said that he had the names of
most of the members, and that the de­
tectives have been instructed to
search for them.
Disclosed by Letters.
Captain Hunt named Frank Alle
grini, whose anarchistic letters and
literature was found one one of the
men. The name of the alleged anar­
chists are said to have been taken
l'rom these letters. They were writ­
ten in 1913, and said to disclose a
widespread plot extending to Rome,
Italy, to destroy churches and church
property of all creeds. According to
Detective Sergeant Paul Riccio, who
aided in translating the letters from
the Italian, in which they were writ­
ten, the headquarters of the society
was in Rome. Efforts were made, it
was said, to organize branches of the
society all over the world. In the
United States public buildings were
to, recirfyja, t^^tent fchf^tinnfy
chislR iii addition to the churches.
Most of the letters were without sig­
natures.
Map and Drawing.
The first of the letters, unaddressed
and unsigned, goes into the details of
a bomb invented by the writer:
"This," says the letter, "will be a
fine' thing to throw among a lot of re­
ligious people when they go out dress­
ed in their best clothes on the boule­
vard to talk the sermon over."
Several maps and drawings were
found. They were said to indicate
that' the plotters had designed on the
Peoples Gas Light & Coke building of
Chicago and other costly structures.

Washington,
Feb. 14.—President
Wilson today consented formally for
the first, time to the use of his name
as a presidential candidate in the
coming campaign. At the same time
he declared he "was entirely unwill­
ing to, enter into any contest for re
nonlination."
This definition of the president's at­
titude in line with the plans of his
political associations is expected to
bring into the open the campaign be­
ing made in his favor throughout the
country.
Mr. Wilson's declaration was made
in a letter to the Ohio secretary of
state, who had written that candi­
dates for delegates from that state to
the convention must signify their
choice for president by February 25,
and that no presidential candidates
could be named in that connection
without their consent.

POISON FOUND
IN CELLAR OF
OPETS HOME
Chain of Evidence Tightens
Around Wisconsin University
Student Accused of Murder.
MaHISON DRUG CLERK
SOLD HIM MEDICINE
Chicago, Feb. 14.—Discovery of a
quantity of poison in the basement' of
the home of Will H. Opet, collegian,
accused of the murder of his former
sweetheart, Marion Frances Lambert,
and the announcement by Lake coun­
ty officials that other arrests were
possible, were developments late to­
day in the inquiry into the death of
Miss Lambert.
The poison was found by State's
Attorney Dady and Chief of Police
McGuirc and, according to the state's
attorney, it was identical with that
which is believed to have ended the
life of the Lake Forest high school
girl.
Drug Clerk Sold Medicine,
Word came from Madison that a
drug clerk had admitted selling a
bottle of medicine to Opet Tuesday
morning, before the young man made
his secret trip to Lake Forest to meet
the girl in the lonely woods where her
body was found.
The parents of the girl disclaimed
today any desire to have Opet releas­
ed from custody and urged that the
law foe permitted to take its course.
Opet remained in the Waukegan jail
and it was said no attempts could be
made to obtain his release until after
the inquest'.
School girl friends of Miss Lambert
were questioned by the state's attor­
ney as to their knowledge of the re­
lations which had existed between
Opet and the school girl.
Chicago, Feb. 14.—A two-ounce bot­
tle purchased at Madison, Wis., and
poison crystals, found buried in an
ash heap in the suburbs of Lake For­
est, are believed by Lake county auth­
orities to form an important link in
the circumstantial evidence involving
William H. Opet, University of Wis­
consin junior, who is under arrest in
connection with the death of Miss
Marion Frances Lambert. Search of
the ash pile resulted from, a tip re­
ceived by State's Attorney Dady. It
was on the estate of Cyrus H. McCor
mick, of which Opet's father, O. E.
Opet, is superintendent. An under
gardner admitted that he buried the
poison under orders from the senior
Opet.

Washington, Feb. 14.—Wihile the
house naval committee continued to­
day its hearing on the navy appropria­
tion bill, the military committee of
both houses prepared to begin draft­
ing the measures they will propose
to strengthen the army. The military
committees, probably, will begin daily
sessions before the end of the week
in order to Hasten their work as Pres­
ident Wilson has urged.
Abandon Types.
Rear Admiral Grant, the submarine
commander, and the first sea duty offi­
cer, who appeared at the hearings,
told the house committee today that
he believed the present type of Ameri­
can submarines should be abandoned
and only large boats of at least 800
tons surface displacement be con­
structed in the future. It was boats
of this size, he said, which had done
the most efficient work for the Ger­
man navy in the present war.
The'admiral will be further examin­
ed tomorrow.
Captain Josiah S. McKean, attached
to the office of the chief of operations
as assistant tor materials, said that
while he was inclined to believe with
Admiral Grant as to the greater value
of large submarines, other officers had
different views.
Get Line On Submarines.
Captain McKean revealed that
much of the navy department's infor­
mation
£bout GtefmSh 'subni&ines" fiad
come from an American bby who
served for a time upon one of them
in active service, before he could es­
tablish his nationality and secure im­
munity from military duty. The uoy,
whose name was not disclosed, came
to the United States as soon as he
was at liberty and proved to be a val­
uable squrce of information.
Has Not Named Successor.
While President Wilson has not se­
lected a new secretary of war, it was
indicated tonight that the choice lay
between Secretary Houston of the de­
partment of agriculture and several
men outside of official life.
It is said that .although the presi­
dent may reach a decision at any time,
it is probable no nomination will be
made for several weeks.
Carl Vrooman, assistant secretary
of agriculture, is said to be a possible
successor to Secretary Houston,
should the latter be shifted to the
war department.

Hon. Fred O. Brewster.
OF TRIBUTE HEARD
Late Fred O. Brewster Was Well
Thought of By Men With
Whom He Associated.
The lodge members are request­
ed to meet at Masonic Temple
Wednesday at 1:30 p. m. to at­
tend the funeral of Late Brother
F. O. Brewster, which will take
place at 2 p. m.
Expressions of regret over the
death of Fred O. Brewster, member of
the state board of control, were'heard
on all. sides at the' capital yesterdy.
xHe* geriefar'popTfttfrity, and the- high
regard in which he was held is evinc
ed by the following expressions:
Acting Governor John 11. Fraine
said:
"Fred Brewster's death, while ex­
pected, is none the less a shock to his
friends. For a year past' he has
fought a fight against disease that, has
surprised and at. times from the cour
aR(! he displayed, has encouraged
them lo hope I hat he might finally re
cover some measure of health which
would enable him to resume his du
ties as a member of the hoard of con
trol.
In his death the stale loses a cap
able and faithful public servant, and
his friends, who are legion in this
state, lose a loyal, kindly, zealous
friend who never doubted but always
defended when his friends were as­
sailed. Humanity is the better for his
having lived and while he will be
missed, he will not be forgotten for
many years."
Attorney General llenry J. Linde
made the following statement:
"The whole state will mourn the
loss of one of its foremost citizens.
Mr. Brewster faithfully served the
best interests of the state and was
at all times active and consistent. He
was the type of a. man which is a
positive asset to the citizenship of
any community."
E. G. Wanner, secretary of the
board of control, had the following to
say:
"In the death of Fred Brewster the
state has suffered a distinct loss. Mr.
Brewster was able, efficient, honest
and honorable in all his dealings.
Was a most agreeable public servant,
and all his effort was always dictated
by the highest principal. The board
feels that Mr. Brewster's place will
be exceedingly hard to fill. He was
always a good friend, and a genial
companion, and it will be a long time
before the gloom which has been
.over the board during the long illness
of Mr. Brewster is dissipated."
Francis J. Murphy, assistant attor­
ney general:
"I feel a sense of personal loss in
the passing of Fred Brewster. A long
acquaintance justifies me in saying
that he was a real man and a friend
in the broadest view of the term."
Adjutant General T. H. Tharabon
said:
"I regret deeply the passing of Fred
Brewster, whom I have known inti­
mately for many years.
"His services to the state and his
loyalty to his friends were inestimable
and in his demise we lose one of our
most loyal citizens.
"He was a man among men."
