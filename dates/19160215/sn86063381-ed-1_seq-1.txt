EXECUTIVE ORDER
EXCEPTED DULUTH
The query raised by Dr. William
Watts Folwell, former president of
the University of Minnesota, as to
whether Duluth may not be included
in the territory covered by the In
dian "lid" treaty of 1854, has been
answered by the prohibitionists who
discovered the treaty provisions and
got the government started on its
law enforcement campaign.
It was pointed out today that Du
luth is within the limits of the 1854
treaty but the anti-liquor provision
of the treaty was revocable by the
president. With three other treaties
of the same character it was modified
by presidential order in 1911.
LINDBERGH BILL MAY
ATTACK INDIAN LID
Washington, Feb. 15."If a ma
jority of the people in the district
affected lying within the Sixth con
gressional district favor the repeal
of the Chippewa treaty of 1855, I
will introduce a bill to that effect,"
says Representative Lindbergh in a
letter sent today to John A. Heff
bauer of Brainerd, regarding the pos
sibility of removing the liquor pro
hibition regulation now being en
forced under the 1855 treaty.
"It has seemed to me," continues
Mr. Lindbergh's letter, "that after
sixty years of failure to invoke the
treaty and after the purpose of its
existence has passed except in a very
limited area, as to other parts of the
territory, like Brainerd for instance,
for the Indian department to come in
and administer the treaty where
there are no Indians is ridiculous."
APPROPRIATION FOR
RED RIVER EXAMINATION
A bill has been introduced in con
gress which provides a lump sum of

of war is authorized to examine and
survey cetrain localities by allotment
from this fund with a view to later

ILLINOIS HUNTERS
CAN'T SHOOT DUCKS
THOUGHSEASON OPENS
Springfield, 111., Feb. 15.The
spring duck shooting season opened
in Illinois today but the water fowl
are passing over the Sucker fields,
rivers and lakes unmolested because
the Federal law prohibits the kill

the United States in the Kansas case
which tests the validity of the law

"HOP
CITY ELECTION
EXPECTED TO
BRING OUT A
RECORD VOTE
Over 300 Votes Have Been Cast Up
to Two o'clock This
Aternoon.
UNEXPECTED INTEREST IS
SHOWN IN MAYOR RACE
Sentiment Favors Mayor William Mc
Cuaig for Re-election May
Be Close.
EXPECTED ALL OFFICIALS
WILL BE RETURNED
Unexpected interest in the city
elections and a bright sunshiny day
brought over 300 voters to the polls
before two o'clock this afternoon
in the annual city election. The
claim is made that the vote of last
year will be increased by 75 votes.
Last year there were 708 votes cast
for mayor. The polls will remain
open until nine o'clock this evening
Mayoralty Race Close."
The race for mayor, it is believed,
will be very close, with the returning
to office of Mayor William McCuaig.
McCuaig in the election last year,
when there were three candidates in
the field, as there is this year, se
cured 292 votes. Simons, his inde
pendent opposition, secured 202 votes
and Kaplan, the Socialist candidate,
secured 214 votes. In 1914, when
only two candidates were in the race,
McCuaig secured 484 votes.
Slight Opposition.
There is but slight opposition to
any of the other present officials. It
is believed that George Stein and
George Rhea will returned by large
votes. Stein in the elections of the
past two years headed the ticket at
each election.
It is believed that T. J. Lloyd will
be returned city assessor over J. B.
Harris, who has been his opponent
for the past two years. Last year
Lloyd received 437 votes and Harris
267 in 1914 Lloyd received 539
votes and Harris 319.
No Opposition.
In the first ward the present alder
man, J. P. Lahr, has no opposition.
It is believed that he will receive a
large vote, however, in recognition
of his excellent work as a member
of the council.
Expected to Win.
In the second ward Tom Smart,
the present alderman, is expected to
defeat Henry Paquin, the Socialist
candidate, by a good vote. Mr. Smart
has always secured a good vote, secur
ing in 1914, 147 votes against his
opponent's 94.
Socialists Broken.
In the third ward Alderman Paul
Foucault, who has always secured a
large vote, it is believed will be re
turned. His opponent is Earl F.
Barber.
In the fourth ward R. B. Miller,
the present alderman, it is expected
will defeat G. Akerberg, the Socialist
candidate.
The Socialist vote is not expected
to be as heavy as in former years as
there is reported to be a split in the
ranks. A number of men who for
merly were strong Socialists have an
nounced that they would not vote the
Socialist ticket this year.
Report by 11 o'clock.
It is believed that the result of the
election should be known by eleven
o'clock tonight.
The following are the election
judges:
