ATTACK ON CHURCHES?
Many Fires Laid to Band
Buildings Marked for
Destruction.
Chicago, Feb. 15. Search was start
ed today for the principals in what is
believed by the police to have been a
plot to destroy buildings and kill
churchmen, both of the clergy and
laity, in a dozen cities of the United
States. Discovery of the alleged plot,
according to the police, resulted from
examination of the personal effects of
John Allegrini confidant of Jean
Crones, who is charged with putting
poison in soup at a banquet given
Archbishop Mundelein, and causing the
illness of 100 of the guests.
Chief of Police Healey, Nicholas
Hunt, chief of detectives, and Deputy
Chief Schuettler announced today
after studying translations of letters
found in Allegrini's rooms that they
regarded as established the existence
of an anti-clerical organization of "de
stroyers" headed by the "committee of
fifteen," of which Crones and Allegrini
are believed to have been members.
Police are searching for Crones, who
is a former assistant chef at the Chi
cago University club, and Allegrini is
in jail charged with conspiracy to com
mit murder.
Four Buildings Marled.
The police were guardjtfjymjikjng
public the contents ofAlfegrini's cor
respondence, but it was stated that
plans and specifications were given for
several huge downtown buildings in
Chicago which, it is said, had been
marked for destruction by the com
mittee. ' These included the People's
Gas Light and Coke company building,
one of the largest office buildings in
the downtown district, the Union
League club, the Federal building and
the Grace hotel.
Destruction in October, 1914, of St.
Alphonsus' Catholic church in New
York a few hours after discovery of a
plot to wreck St. Patrick's Catholic
church there is believed by Captain
Hunt to have been a part of the alleged
plot According to the detective who
did the translating of the letters found
in Allegrini's rooms, certain ring lead
ers in a conspiracy which is said to be
international in scope, have headquar
ters in Rome. "They are in the very
shadow of the Vatican, according to
the letters," said that officer. He added
that some of the letters contained de
tailed descriptions of bombs used by
the conspirators. Some of these, he
said were designed to wreck buildings,
others to kill policemen and others to
spread death among church goers.
Hare 'ames of Leaders.
Names of thes"committee of fifteen"
are said to be in the hands of the po

before night.
Police working on the cases, pointed
out today that the illness of 50 guests
who attended the Knights of Columbus
banquet, Oct 2 last, might be due to

WORK OF SAILORS
SAVES A WARSHIP
Philadelphia, Ta., Feb. 15. Quick
work of sailors on the battleship North
Dakota at the Philadelphia navy yard
saved the ship from serious damage
by fire last night. The sailors Jumped
from their bunks at the sound of the
fire alarm and extinguished a slight
blaze in the engine room in about
three minutes. The fire was started
by the blowout of a fuse in a dynamo.
Oil caught fire and ignited woodwork.
An alarm was sounded and when the
sailors discovered that oil was ablaze
Ihey grabbed a bag of sand which is
kept in the engine room for such an
emergency and threw the sand on the
burning fluid, putting out the fre.
The tire was a good test of the effi

CHINA PREPARES
TO STAY ATTACK
OF REBEL BANDS
Hankow, Jan. 13. (Correspondence
TOT- the Associated Press.) Every" pre
caution is being taken by the Chinese
government to prevent Hankow and
the neighboring cities of Wu-Chang
jand Han-Yang from falling into revo-
lutionary control. Strict guard Is kept
lover the Han Yang arsenal, northern
I troops having been placed in charge
of this important arms and ammuni
tion center. Big guns have been plac
ed on Tortoise Hill and Serpent Hill
at Hang-Yang, which command all
i three of the cities. These two hills
overlook both the Yang-Tse and the
Han rivers, which join at this place
and make it possible for the force
holding them to control all river traf
fic, as well as the land situation.
Since the Yun-Nan revolt became
known in Hu-Peh province, there have
been many executions of rebels and
their agents at Wu-Chang, the capital
of Hu-Peh province, which lies across
the Yang-Tse from Hankow. Execu
tions have also been frequent at Han
kow and Han-Y'ang. Consequently
there is little discussion of the politi
cal situation in public places by the
common people and the local newspa
pers print virtually no news concern
ing the revolution, excepting official
telegrams and dispatches supporting
the monarchial movement.
In spite of the various rumors of rev
olutionary activity, the government
appears to have very good control of
the situation. Troops have been scat
tered along the Ysang-Tse river in
such a way as to prevent the great wa
ter course from falling under the con
trol of revolutionists.
Shallow water steamers of the Sino-
Japanese Steamship company have
'been employed by the government, to
jgether with Chinese steamers, for the
transportation of troops up the sang
Tse to I-Chang, from that point wood
en boats must be used to Chung-King.
From there the troops will enter into
the province of Kwei-Chow, going over
land. Already the first division of
Hu-Peh trops has started up the Yang
Tse, and it will be Joined by the third
division of the northern army. Trans
portation is extremely difficult both
on the upper Ysang-Tse and overland
from Chung-King to Kwei-Chow prov
ince. Consequently the movement will
be slow and the -troops will not be
able to carry heavy guns. However,
they are amply provided with rifles and
cartridges.
It is apparent that the Chinese gov
ernment is directing its military oper
ations so as to surround Yun-Nan and
prevent the revolution from spreading
rather than in an effort to enter Yun
Nan and actually suppress the revolu
tionaries on their own ground.
For the pacification of the public In
Hu-Peh and Sze-Chuen provinces
through which the expedition will pass
in making its way to Kwei-Chow prov
ince, military officers have Issued no
tices that all purchases made by the
officers and soldiers will be paid for
in cash and that no boats or carts will
be commandeered by the army without
payment. A military transportation
office has been established at Hankow
esueeially for this purpose, with
j brandies at I-Chang and Chung-King.
HeavyQuake
Far Distant
Is Recorded

on the seismographs of Georgtown'ljn
iversity here. It lasted more than an
hour. The heaviest shocks took place
between 7:01 and 7:03 o'clock. It was
approximately between 4,500 and 4,600
miles from Washington.
The record of the disturbance shows
it began at 6:51 o'clock and continued
until after 8 a :m. The direction of tiue
movement was east and west.
Director Tondorf of the observatory.
said the record indicated a very heavy
earthquake which, if it has occurred
on land, will be heard from.
Frequently such earthquakes are of
subterranean origin and are confined
to the ocean's bottom.
Buffalo, N. Y., Feb. 15. The seismo
graph at Canisius college here today
(recorded an earthquake with the pre
liminary at 6:52 o'clock and the main
shock 7:01 to 7:03 o'clock. The tremor
ceased at 7:30 o'clock. It was estimat
ed to be about 4,250 miles distant, with
direction doubtful. The local record
did not indicate a severe shock.
In previous military movements the
public has suffered very badly at the
hands of soldiers of all' armies and
consequently the .government thought
it aavisaDie to allay tea", concerning i
the action of the expeditionary forces.

FOR DRUG BOTTLE
Chicago, Feb. 15. Search for the
bottle in which was carried the poison
which caused the death of Marian
Frances Lambert, Lake Forest high
school girl, continued today. Detec
tives are endeavoring to establish a
connection between the girl's death
last Wednesday and the myterious ab
sence from Madison of William H.
Orpet, University of Wisconsin jun
ior. The assertion by the police that
a drug clerk in Madison had admit
ted he sold Orpet an empty bottle, and
the finding of poison crystals in an
ash heap in the cellar of the Orpet
home are the principal developments
of the last 4S hours in the Lake Forest
case.
A gardener on the McCormick es
tate, of which Orpet's father is care
taker, is said to have admitted put
ting the poison in the ash heap. This
was explained by the elder Orpet by
the statement that the poison had
been used to kill insects on shrubbery
but that Its inferior quality had ren
dered it useless.

CIRCUIT JUDGES
FILE MANDAMUS
SUIT FOR RAISE
salaries were raised by the last gen
erajUassembly from $10,000 to $12,000
a year asked leave in the supreme
court here today to file a petition for
mandamus to compel County Clerk
Robert M. Sweitzer of Cook county to
pay them their "raise."
Attorney S. S. Gregory and Charles
S. Cutting filed the motions on behalf
of Judge Frederick Smith and Judge
Jess E. Holdom. The circuit Judges
lire elected June 7, the bill raising
their pay was passed June 24, but the
judges did not assume office until
July 13.
So that it might not be held that the
raise in salary was given them during
their term of office the judges arranged
to have their certificates of election
held up in Chicago until Governor
Dunne had signed the bill. Through
an oversight in Chicago last summer
an overzealous clerk hastened the
election certificates to Springfield.
Judge Cutting, as their representative
was sent to Springfield and had the
bill rushed to the governor for his
signature and also managed to keep
the election certificates from being
filed for several days after they were
received here.
County Clerk Sweitzer was not sat
isfied, it is said, that he legally could
pay the judges their increase, so ac
cording to Judge Cutting, his clients
determined to bring a "friendly suit"
to compel payment.
As all circuit court judges were In
terested in the suit and as they some
times sit on the appellate court bench
there was no Judicial body lower than
tne supreme, court of the state which
might consiler the case without being
subjected to criticism,
according to
Judge Cutting.

pany, in which fire broke out in
one of the levels while 220 min

Butte, Mont., Feb. 15. Twenty-one
miners lost their lives in a fire last
night in an air shaft of the Pennsyl
vania mine of the Anaconda Copper
Mining company. Twelve others are
missing. The fire still was burning
fiercely yet today.
In the rush and excitement of the
fire several miners failed to report off

ably a dozen, was in doubt.
Neill Brennan and William Mitchell,
assistant foremen, were among the
first of the rescuers to go underground
and they came up several times before
they were finally overcome. Their bod

Hope for Missing Ones.
A new ventilating system was in
stalled in the mine today which
changed the air currents. There is
still hope that some of the missing
men may have escaped into the work
ings of other properties.
Within a few minutes after the fire
was discovered In the timbering at the
1,200 foot level near the shaft, gas
fumes and smoke poured Into the
higher workings of the mine. Station
tenders were ordered to warn the
hundreds of miners, some of whom
were as much as a quarter of a mile
from the shaft.
Signals to the engineer from the
cage came from half a dozen levels
at once. Insistent calls came from the
500 foot level. One cage full of men
was taken from there but when it was
again lowered to this level there were
no men at the landing. William G.
Mitchell, assistant foreman- of the
mine, and Jack Brennan, a miner
who volunteered, were quickly low
ered to the 500 foot level. A few min
utes later their bodies were found by
first aid rescue crews. Both were over
come within a few yards of the shaft.
First aid teams with complete equip
ment of respirators and oxygen hel
mets had great difficulty in penetrat
ing the drifts.
Most of the dead and missing men
were at work on the 500 foot or adjoin
ing levels.
Officers of the Anaconda company
gave out a statement saying they had
no means of determining the cause of
the fire.

In a suit against the company as an

The committee may consider whether

Nothing Against Brandels.
When the hearing on the nomina

read this telegram from Mr. Melien:
"I have no Information of any char
acter that would be of any value to
the sub-committee on the Brandels
nomination. I have no papers that
have any bearing on the case. Under
these circumstances may I not be ex
cused from attending?"
Senator Walsh said in the absence
of Chairman Chilton he wired Mr. Mel
ien:
"Mr. Barron testifying before judic
iary committee Thursday asserted you
could testify to facts establishing the
charge that Brandels was employed
to wreck the New Haven road. Having
In mind your telegram of today, please

any information that will shed light
on truth or falsity of the charge."
To that Senator Walsh received an
