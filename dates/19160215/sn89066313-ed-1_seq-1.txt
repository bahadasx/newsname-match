the or six-stor), fireproof hotel
fronting 7P. feet on Broadwa) anil ex
tending back '.iq feet on Seentlt street,
having 70 to 75 bedrooms, the build
ing alone to cost more than $75,000
this was the plan unanimously in
dorsed at a mass meeting of repre
sentative citizens at the Commercial
Club's rooms last night. A committee
of eighteen was appointed to raise a
runil of $S.00(i to complete the re
quired bonus.
I, W Dumas lias agreed to build
Hit- hotel provided a ?20.00 fund is
raised or this sum $12,000 is already
assured
K V. Stephens was in charge of tlie
meeting last liiglit.
Judge J. A. Stewart said that one of
the best evidences that the hotel
would succeed was the eagerness with
which hotel men over Missouti Ii.nl
applied for leasing the new building.
Several Proposals to Lease II.
"Since the news of Columbia's hav
ing a definite hotel proposition lias
gone oul."he said."I iiave received not
les that half a dozen letters from big
hotel men. wanting first option on
leasing the new hotel as soon as it is
completed. I think the hotel would
paj from the first and would not hurt
the other hotels here now."
Mr Dumas, who is offering to erect
the building provided the lot, valued
at $10,000. and $4,000 in casli arc giv
en as a bonus, explained the details of
the hotel
The first floor will be for a lobby
and dining room," lie said. "I cannot
say whether there will be five or six
stories The cost will determine that.
The top will be finished so that If only
five are built at first, a sixth story may
lie added without inconvenience." Mr
Dumas said the building would be a
little smaller than the Madison hotel
at Jefferson City, which has almost
100 bedrooms. The plans for the Co
lumbia hotel call for 72 bedrooms.
"Tliis is the most definite and the
best hotel proposition that has ever
Ifen up before the people," F. TV.
Xeidermejer said, "We know what
Kind or work Mr. Dumas does from the
Dumas apartments whicli he has built.
He is a homo man and we know he
will do tiie building well"
Plan Is Indorsed.
After a general discussion, a reso
lution heartily indorsing the proposi
tion was passed and a committee of
eighteen men was appointed to raise
the necessary $8,000.
A C Daviess, business manager of
tlie 1'niversity Missourian. said the
.Missourijii believed in tlie hotel for
Columbia "And," he added, "we be
lieve in it strongly enough to contrib
ute $30 in cash to the campaign com
mittee as soon as it Is named, and
furthermore will give as much as $150
wrth of advertising free commencing
tomorrow, to raise the 1S.O00."

he is onlv 21. Critics saj that he is
destined to b" one of America's great

He is tall, with luminous brown ejes.
You might think, he was a I'ni

"Of course, I am an American," said
.Mr. Stoessel. "And perhaps it i.s be
cause or this that I think that Amer
ican Universities and American stu
dent life are supeiior to those of Ger
man). Your university buildings, in
stead of being relics, insanitary and
crowded, as are those of Germany,
are beautiful and seem to be built
tor nii-t'ern purposes.
"And the student life is much more
wholesome and there seems to be a
greater degree of fiiendship The Amor
lean devotion to athletics is responsi
ble for this, I think. The only clubs
or ocieie-J t iat the German students
have are their drinking societies. The
student v. Ho has the greatest capacity

brawls there is the most popular It
Is not an uncommon sight to see stu
dents in a cafe trjing to outdrink each
other, with possiblj two or four mask

sars of these lights are marks of hon
orable distinction to them.

Dr. Kumm has made four trips into

the Sudan to determine the causes and
extent of the Mohammedan advance.
With 35 pack oxen, 7 riding horses,
the same number ot pack horses and
250 men and women, he began his
march. He had been warned against
the Sentvssi, an African chief, and it
was with timidity that he advanced in
to the land of this ruler.

For eighteen da)s the members of
the party traveled through elephant

behind them la) eighteen dats journey

Grease was boiled and tea made. Doc

could make a sort of hanging bridge of

For eight days more they traveled,
living on grass and antelope skins.
Their horses were dead, and Doctor
