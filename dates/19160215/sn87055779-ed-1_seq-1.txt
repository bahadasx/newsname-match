Only the fact that an examination

Willlara Henning from receiving a
severe sentence in circuit court
Wednesday morning. Henning
pleaded guilty to the charge of is
suing fraudulent checks.
Judge Walter A. Funk on the rec
ommendation of F'eputy Pros. Sam
uel P. "chwartz, lined Henning
$100, the fine to be stayed out at
tho penal farm. Because, of tho
young man's serious condition, it
was urged that he be sent to th
penal farm, where he could be out
doors and have a. chance to rec over.
"I would suggest," said Judge
Funk In pronouncing sentence, "that
when your time has expired at the
penal farm, that you lead u correct
life. It will be summer time then,
and everything will be in your favor.
Do not try to get something for
nothing. Honest work is much
safer, while the very thought lodged
in your mind that you may be able
to get something without working
for it, is dangerous, and almost in
evitably leads to an llleg-al act."
Henning' methods of passing
these checks, it was revealed, was
to purchase a small quantity of vials
and drugs at a pharmacy, cash a
check much larger than was actual
ly nect-K.ory to pay for tho drugs,
and pocket the change.

by special investigators of the Keller
administration in the latter's efforts
to eiean up the city. Charles Dibler,
one of the special detectives who
has been doing the "sleuthing" and
who, together with Bert Omstead.

Current in the city Tuesday was
a report that the investigation was
to be of even a more sweeping na

but billiard hall proprietors are said
to have allowed minors in their es

Further than this, it is said, wit

on horse races goes, will be
supenaed to appear before the gTand
jurors. No witnesses had been sum

day as far as could be learned, the
investigators being too busily en
gaged in hearing the evidence col
lected by Dibler.
The exposures revealed by Dibler,
are said to be of a startling nature,
and bear evidence of a most careful
and searching scrutiny. That the
prosecutor and city authorities would
cooperate in pushing to the limit

admitted Tuesday.

STICK AROUND
WHITE HOUSE
Calls Off Proposed Swings
Around Circle to Talk Pre
paredness Owing to Seri
ous Complications.
AWAITS REPORT OF
COL HOUSE, ENVOY
United States Has No Real
Friend Among Belliger
entsNations Are Not
Ready to Talk Peace.
International News Scrvvr:
WASHINGTON, Fev 15. Pres't
Wilson detlnitely abandoned his
planned additional "swings around
the circle" in behalf of his prepar
edness policy, it was learned today,
because of the increasing serious
complications facing this country in
its international relations. He is
impressed with the belief that the
coming six months mijst bear far
more directly on the future of the
United States than any period in the
past. And the one thing which he
is awaiting with profound serious
ness is an early personal report from
Col. E. M. House, his special envoy
to Europe.
Col. House, who will return to
Washington as soon as possible,
went to Europe on a two-fold mis
sion. His first object was to de
termine w hether there was any pros
pect whatever for peace negotia
tions to win out if initiated by Pres't
Wilson. His answer, already cabled
and communicated to the president
immediately after he returned to
Washington from his western speak
ing trip, was that England will not
consent to any peace suggestions at
present and that France intended to
await the outcome of her summer
campaign to drive the Germans
from French soil before admitting a
willingness to accept even a suggest
ion of outside interference by neu
tral or partisan.
Learns Ileal I Velins:. .
The second object was to learn
just what the real feeling of the
European belligerents was toward
the Fnited States. This report, ab
solutely confidential, is more or less
a tale of woe. The Teutonic allies
believe that this government has
not been frank with their cause.
The colonel was frankly told that
If the whole truth of the Teutonic
allies' cause was known in the
United States the entire sympathy
of the "western world" would be
with them. Cutting of the German
cable and "entirely indefensible cen
sorship of their wireless" the last
terms are German official have
made this impossible. Col. House
Was told by the kaiser's closest ad
visers. And lie brings with him a sharp
protest against all American censor
ship of German wireless which is
not extended to the cables commun
icating with the entente allies.
Allies Art- Bitter.
Great Britain and France are bit
ter because "America is enriching
herself from the war." while Italy
and Russia, although comparatively
Indifferent, back up the sentiment of
their allies. Col. House, it is un
derstood, was told by French of
ficials that if the United States had
supported France as France has
supported tlii country in the past,
the war would be over now. The
French position, he has been told,
and part of this report already is
In the president's hand, is that no
suggestions of peace can even be
entertained until French soil js
cleared of France's enemies. J
Englind was even more unrcspon-j
sive. The United States is ac cused I
by the highest British officials of;
"playing the German game" through
making protests for "political" ef
fect.

international News Service:
CHICAGO, Feb. 15. A network
of circumstantial evidence continued
I to be woven about William H. Orpet
today enmeshing the young Univer
sity of Wisconsin student in a snare
which authorities of Iake county de
clared was complete enough already
to convict him of the murder of
pretty Marian Frances Lambert, 18-year-old
high school girl of the
fashionabla suburb cf Lake forest.
Link by link, the chain of circum
stances connecting the confessed be
trayer of the girl with his violent
death, has been pieced together until
State's Atty. Dady today declared
that he was ready to begin prosecu
tion of Orpet on a charge of first
degree murder.
The last two links' In the evidence
chain were the discovery of a poison
cache on the Cyrus 1 1. McCormick
estate at Lake Forest, where Orpet's
father is superintendent, and the
discovery in Madison, Wis., that Or
pet purchased an empty two-ounce
bottle of a druggist there a week
ago today, a few hours before he
left the university city to come to
Lake Forest to keep the fatal tryst
with Marian Lambert.
Went Rack to Get Bottle.
Orpet himself had destroyed his
alibi when he confessed that he was
with the girl when she died at the
foot of three oak trees in Helm's
woods last Thursday morning. Foot
prints in the snow plainly revealed
that the man who was with Miss
Lambert walked away from where
she lay after the poi.on had passed
her lips and then retraced his teps.
The state's attorney expects to
prove that Orpet went back to do
away with the poison bottle.
Orpet has insisted that the girl
committed suicide because she be
lieved herself in a delicate condition.
The girl's friends assert that the
girl, on the contrary was happy be
cause she had relieved herself of
her trouble.
These facts, the state's attorney
declares, destroys Orpet's statement
that she had a motive for suicide.
It is belieed, however, that Miss
Lambert had led Orpet to believe
she was still in trouble, after she
learned of his reported engagement
to Miss Celestia Yuker, of DeKalb.
111. This, according to the Lake
county authorities will enable the
prosecution to fix a motive on Orpet.
Deaf Mute is Witness.
State's Atty. Dady today called
before him David James, the deaf
mute who wrote a statement that

Mr. William Clem.
Board of Education
South Bend, Indiana.
My dear Mr. Clem:
Wh.le on the train going from South Bend to Lafayette, last Friday
afternoon. I saw in the South Ben paper that there was some oppo
sition to the reappointment of Supt. j. Montgomery us head of y.uir
fchools for another term. This was very much of a surprise to mo. as
I have regarded Mr. Montgomery's work at South Bend a.- strictly first
class.
I am writing you this letter solejv on my own responsibility to give
you a bit of information in regard t0" Mr. Montgomery's work as it is re
garded by the school people of the sate, because 1 think you might not
be in a position to get this information otherwise.
As you know, I go all over the staf and am more or less intimately
acquainted with the schools in all Of tno cities of the state, and 1 am
also in a position to know the educaors anj superintendents of the
state xegard as the best superintendent s nf the state. Mr. Montgomery
is regarded by the schools of the state as one of the best men engacred
In educational work in the .täte. Personally I do not believe there is a
better or more progressive superintendent in the entire state, and I
would, therefore, very much regret peeing,him leave South Ben I or the
etate.
I do not know anything about thP cau.6 of the apparent trouble but
I cannot think of his leaving South Bend without feeling that his go
ing would mean a great misfortune to the cause of education in South
Bend, and I, therefore, sincerely hopP that the intimation that he may
not be returned which I saw in the Paper on Friday is a mistake
I am writing this letter to you merely to give you this information
and my impression of Mr. Montgomcrys work. I have no thought
whatever of trying to influence your judgment or to do your thinking
for you. I merely wanted to give you a bit of information that I
thought you might not have or be in a position to get.
Trusting this letter will be received in the spirit in which it writ
ten, I remain.
Very sincerely your,

MONSTER PLOT
Anarchists Planned to Destroy
Church, Private and U.
S. Property.
International News Service:
CHICAGO, Feb. 10. Whilo the
police of every city in the country
were on the lookout for Jean Crones,
suspected poisoner of the Foup
served to prominent Catholic
churchmen and Chicago business
and professional men. 4 00 Chicago
detectives were at work piecing to
gether the evidence contained in a
batch of letters found in Crones'
room and in the possession of'John
Allegrini, friend of Crones, which
reveal an astounding anarchistic
plot.
The scheme to poison the guests
at the Archbishop Mundelein ban
quet last Thursday night was a mere
detail in a gUantlc, plot of destruc
tion, aimed at the Catholic church
and clergy, large corporations end
the government of the United States.
Detective Sergt. Paul Riecio. who
made translations of the letters, de
duced that some of the leaders of
'he plotters, of whom Crones and
Allecrini are believed to have been
prominent figures, made their head
quarters In Rome, in the very
shadow of the Vatican.
Only a smal part of the pints men
tioned in the letters was made publl
by the police today. Capt. Hunt of
the detective bureau admitted that
the recent attempt to destroy St.
ratrick's Roman Catholic church in
Nw York, was a part of the anarch
istic plot. The- Chicago federal build
ing, and the Peopb-'s Gas Light and
Coke Co. 's million dollar building
were among those the police said
were marked for early destruction
here.
In one letter made public by the
police in which Crones explained in
detail the mechanism of a new bomb
he was perfecting, the suspected
plotter wrote:
"This will be the right thing to
throw amongst a lot of religious
people when they go out dressed in
their best clothes on th boulevards
to talk the sermon over. Eueu. A
good thrower could throw his bomb
right on the foot of a policeman
when he stands on the corner with
his club in his hand, and it will snd
him to pieces. Justice would bo
done and the thrower could smoke
his cigar and the thrower would not
bo suspected. How's that?"
"A committee of 13" of the an
archistic band was named in one of
the letters. The police took the list
of names and detectives were sent
out today to search for thern. Capt.
Hunt said he expected sv-tal, if
not all. of the "committee" to be
arrested before tonight.
