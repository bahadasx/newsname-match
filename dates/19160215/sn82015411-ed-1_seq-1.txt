LAW PLAYS A
HEARTLESS PRANK
Law has played a sad trick on
a youthful couple (Portuguese) at
Koloa. The youn-rman, formetly
of llanamatilu, and the girl, a na
tive of Koloa, were to have, been
married Saturday night. The fat
ted pig had been killed, the other
.elements of the feast prepared and
t friends had been invited to the
mairiagc festival, when. Lo! it was
discovered that the bride could
not get married under Hawaiian
law for the reason that she lacked
about two months of being fifteen
years of age. Judge Dickey was
appealed to, but he ruled that there
was no way around the difficulty.
On top of this calamity came the
second great slam. The employer
of the boy, learning of the affair,
discharged the would-be bride
groom forthwith. Thus the latter
is minus his girl (at least for a
while) and is also separated from
his job.
Anyway, there was a feast. All
the pilikia came about so late that
it was decided to let the friends
come and as much disappoint jnent
as possible was offset in merry
making. At the end of two months or so
the belated wedding bells may
ring, and all be well.
oailWIE
OF
Companies A and B, National
Guard, will have drill in Lihue
park at 2 o'clock next Sunday af
ternoon. The object of this turn
out is to give the people of Lihue
a chance to see the companies in
action in daylight all drills here
tofore having been held at night.
There was some idea of also hav
ing battalion movements at that
time, but the conclusion was reach
ed finally that that would be shov
ing hiatters a little rapidly.
Company A will be commanded
by Captain Maser, with Lieuten
ants Garden and Kopper; Com
pany B by Wm Henry Rice, with
Lieutenants Avery and Fountain.
The public is invited to witness
the maneuvers.
Mr. Spillner 111
Carl Spillner, bookkeeper at the
Makaweli store, was operated on
at the Lihue hospital last Tuesday.
He is getting along well and will
shortly be about again.

ABE CALLED FOR
Arrangements have been made
whereby the wharf at Waitnea will
be completed without extraordi
nary delay, The government has
called for tenders to be submitted
by March 1st, us soon as possible
after which the contract will be let
and actual work will begin.
This new move created some
little surprise, in view of the con
demnation suit recently instituted
by the government, which will not
come on for hearing until the July
court term. It is understood, how
ever, that work will begin with
the consent and approval of all of
the partfes interested in the land
to be affected.
Something like $30,000 will be
put into the new wharf property.
The improvement was provided
for by the last legislature, the
item being placed in the loan bill.
Completion of the undertaking
became a question of finances, and
Kauai parties agreed to take the
amount of bonds necessary to put
the new wharf through.
DANIEL I DEAD
Daniel I, head stock man for
the Kilauea Sugar Company, died
Wednesday of pneumonia, after
an illness of only a few days.

much of the island, and was well
liked. Up to two years ago he
was manager of the Kilauea base
ball team, and took quie an inter
est in athletics generally. He was
a brother of Joseph I, the mail
man on the Hanalei route.
Mr. I left a widow and nine
children.

RECEPTION AT THE
ROMEO N SENS
Mr. and Mrs. E. A. Knudsen
tendered a delightful reception
Thursday evening in honor of
'Mr. Morton, of Australia, who has
been visiting Mr, Hart, at Maka
weli. Many of the young people be
tween Mana and Koloa were pres
ent. For the occasion "Hoea" was
prettily adorned, and vari-colored
oriental lanterns lent striking pic
turesquesness to the scene. Be
hind a palm-bower an Hawaiian
orchestra, developed from the
players on the Knudsen ranch,
supplied delightful music.
After an informal reception,
during which all present met the
guest of honor, dancing began and
was kept up to a late hour.
Mr. Morton is spending a short
time only on Kauai. He is leav
ing shortly for England where he
expects to join the colors and pro
ceed to scenes of battle, on the
Continent.
NEW CLUB DANCE
AT ELEELE HALL
The new club, organized by Mr.
Dye and others for the purpose
of arranging dances between other
club affairs, delightfully entertain
ed a large party of young people
from all parts of the island in Elc
ele hall Saturday evening. The
attendance was probably the record
for that place this season, and judg
ing from appearances and the hour
when adjourned came, there was
not a flaw anywhere.
Under the plan adopted for this
new club, the expenses of i t s
dances are met by assessment up
on its members. It is a new idea
here, but the start-off gave very
general satisfaction, and the scheme
as a whole will in all probability
ensure additional social activity of
the right sort for a large number
of young people,
ARMORIES TO BE
BUILT SHORTLY
The armory at Kealia, for use
of the National Guard companies
of that locality, will be built at
once by Col. Z. S. Spalding. The
site has already been laid out and
plans are being prepared.
Plans are also well advanced for
the armory at Eleele, which will
be built at the baseball park by
Mr. F. A, Alexander.
It is understood that definite ac
tion in regard to an armory for
Makaweli will be -taken before the
end of the present week. Manager
and also, Major Baldwin stated
last night that the structure would
go in the neighborhood of the
baseball park and office.
The Lihue armory matter seems
to be moving along quietly.
Waimea Literary
The Waimea Literary Society, or
Club, met with Mr. and Mrs. F. A.
Alexander, at Electa, .Saturday
evening, tho gathering being un
usually large. Mr. Millikcn pre
sented the lwiok review, and Mr.
E. A. Knudsen discussed in an in
teresting way the timely subject" of
"Preparedness". Others presented
views on that question. The pro
grain as a whole was conceded to be
most enjoyable.
JUDGE RUDDY
A NARROW ESCAPE
Judge William Iluddv, of Hana
lei, had a narrow escape from
death in a flood which swept down
through the Moloaa region last
Wednesday afternoon,
His horse and broke were swept
from the road by surging waters,
and onlv by a quick scramble to
higher ground was the Judge able
to save his own life.
The flood wascausedby extreme
ly heavy rains against the hills
during the day, the water accumu
lating and driving down through
the valley, or gulch, known as
Moloaa with tremendous force.
Judge Huddv has a place in Mo
loaa and was on his way to it when
struck by the flood.
Horse and brake were washed
from the road. Had the animal
been loose he would probably have
escaped, but being entangled with
harnesi and debris was carried to
his-doom. Judge Huddy saw the
impending danger in time to save
himself.
A flood of the same kind, and
similar cause, swept over the small
canefield and road below the resi
dence of Francis Gay. Makaweli,
some days ago, but luckliy there
was no one on the road at that
point at the time. The voungcane
was swept from the field and left
in withered piles against the road
way, while the road itself was
washed to bed-rock.
THAT BIG BANQUET
T
Preparations are about complete
for the big Chamber of Commerce
rally at Hotel Waimea Thursday
evening. Host "Dick" Oliver is
putting in overtime getting ready,
and stated last night that his part
of the affair would be carried out
to perfection.
Business of the Chamber will be
rushed as much as possible, as it
is the intention to make of this
banquet-session a record breaker
for an all-round good time. The
entertainment committee has been
diligently at work and will spring
some big surprises
The indications last night were
that the attendance would be the
largest in the history of the orga
nization. Up to that time only nine
excuses had been received, which,
figured on past experience, looks
like au attendance of seventy-five
or mote members.
The cards sent out are made re
turnable direct to Host Oliver.who
is keeping the secretary advised
of the progress of "bookings."
