Webster County Man Who
Libertine Preacher
BY REP. PUMPHREY
HAS CONFIDENCE OF
DIIUBCII AND FRIENDS
Frankfort, Ky., Feb, 12.
Frankfort Is in a turmoil tonight
as tho result of a clash today in
tho honso of representatives dur-
ig tho dobate noon tho state
wide prohibition bill between
Hops. J. D. Pumphrey of Flem
ing county and W. D. Harvey of
ijfobster, in which tho lio was
(pBB8cd and Harvey was referred
ito byrPamphroy as "a hypocriti
cal libertine preacher." A flst
fight was narrowly averted.
J. 1). Pumphroy, following at
tack on Gov. Stanley by W. B.
Harvey, arose and said :
4 Oar governor has been slac
dorod by tho member from Web
oter. Gov. Stanley has never in
auy hotol caused a woman's voice
to ring out until tho night watch-
W man was attracted. It iB not fit
I V tinp, therefore, that ho be at-
I tacked by a hypocritical, liber
N tino preacher, who has attempted
-consortium with a chambermaid."
Rep. Harvey at this point leap
ed to hia feet and advancing
down the aisle of tho chamber,
charged Pumphroy with falsify-
i v . "
ismfmrnr -mrrnr'ieminir couniv
has presented himself before the
chamber as a dry advocate and I
want to say now that when he
did that he lied. If ho votes in
fayor of the propose! amend
ment he will do so because-of the
pressure exerted by his constitu
ents. "Aa to tho charge of J. D;
Pumphroy on the lloor of the
house, that 1 insulted a woman
in the Oupitol hotel, is as black a
falsehood as was over dtliberato
ly aud maliciously planned by an
unprincipled man against his en
emy. I challenge Mr. Pumphrey
and "the woman to show their
proof in support of his charge,
and if Mr. Pumphrey or the wo
man, or Mr. Punyihroy and tho
woman, have one scintilla of ev
idence, to have me arrested
forthwith.
"The truth of the matter is, a
strange woman, who, I am in
formed by the proprietor of the
liotel, bad never been in the ho
tel before, came straight from
Mr, Pumphrey a door to my room
ff the afternoon and, with tho
d pv ajar, without. any cause, be-
(n screaming. Mr. Perry, rep
resentative from Louisville,
whose room iB across the hall
from mini, hoard mo say, "Wo
man, what is tho matter with
you?'1 I hurriedly wont to iu
form the proprietor what had
happened, uud when 1 reached
the foot of tho steps Mr. Pum
phrey was standing there. In a
day or two afterward, Mr. Pum
phrey called me into his room
and appearing to bo in a very
good humor, utked mo about the
affair I refusod to disousB it
with him and told him that ho
know as much about it as I did.
'Slnnn Mien, soma of tho men
who onnosed tho state-wide
amendment have tried to hoi
i this as a club ovpr my head to
keep mo from doing wnai i con

Tragedy at Hamby Sta
tion Last February
Being Tried
JUDGE HENDERSON
BENIfcS CONTINUANCE
. "When the case i of the Common
wealth of Kentucky against Jim Rob
inson was called in Circuit Court
yestei'w.y afternoon, Commonwealth
Att. FurgerSoiv, County Att. Sypert
and. Waddill & LafToon, secured fo
assist in the prosecution, asked the
court for a continuance on account
of the fact, they stated, of the failure
of several important witnesses, scat
tered over, the stale, not being pres
ent. For the same reason Atts. Fox
& Powell and Breathitt and Trimble,
representing the defendant, asked
the court to al'ow them a few days
in which to also locate a number of
their witnesses who failed to show up
Judge Henderson insisted that the
case be entered into, claiming that
sufficient witnesses for both prosecu
tion and defence were present to be
gin trial, and stated that he would
appoint special bailiffs and send them
to any part in the state in order to
bring in the witnesses supposed to be
here for the trial. A demurrer to the
indictment was filed by the defence,
which was immediately overruled by
the court. Empanelling the jury
started at 8 o'clock in the afternoon,
and only seven having been agreed
upon on,by both sides, as- follows:
G. B. Hale, Lee Oglesby, J. L.
Whitfield, G. W. Carey, J. V.
Flynn, Willis Walker and O. J.
Thomas. The panel was exhausted
and the sheriff ordered to summon
fifty men, from which the jury will
probably be completed this morning.
Court adjourned until 9 o'clock this
morning.
Attorneys for the prosecution
stated that at least eleven important
witnesses were absent, some of them
being ill, whi e others were in the
eastern part of the stale. Judge
Henderson assured them that the
court woul have them here if such
a thing was possible and was not
willing to grant a continuance, when
so many had answered present for
both sides. Perhaps 150 witnesses
were present yesterday, when the
work of selecting a jury started.
Robinson is one of the men under
indictment charged with wilful mur
der, as a result of the killing of
Demmitt Woodruff and Grover
Hoard at Hamby Station last Feb
ruary, one year ago. Floyd Cranor
was indicted on the same charge, but
he has never been arrested. C. S.
Bookwalter, coal operator; Otto
Hamilton and Grover Todd, indic
ted as accessories before the fact, in
the case, when their cases were call
ed yesterday, Judge Henderson con
tinued them until next Saturday.
