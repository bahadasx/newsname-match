Chairman Hay

Washington, Feb. 14. The resigna
tion of Secretary of War Garrison last
wook lias had far-reaching results
upon congress, in the opinion of ad
ministration leaders.
Whoii the excitement following the
unexpected development had subsid
ed. It was apparent that it had Clari
fied the legislative atmosphere with
regard to two important Issues, na
tional deferso and Philippine Inde
pendence, and had served to bring
congress and the presldont closer to
gether than they had been for many
months.
As to nnt'onal defense, the resigna
tion of tho secretary finally scaled
tho fate or his continental army plan,
which chairmen of both house and
coiiatc military committees declaied
never vii'd "have been accepted by
congress. Work began at once on ;
preparation for framing a plan of
federalization of the national guard
to create a rosarvo defensive force
for tho nation.
Representative Hay, chairman of
the houfco committee, already is at
work icdrafting the house bill, elim
inating the continental army feature.
Tho somite military committee, hav
ing' concluded Its hearings, is down
to tho task of framing Its bill, and
Sonator Chamberlain, the chairman,
proposes to confer with members of
tho honre committee as the work pro
gresses. An effort will bo made by
both committees to co-operate as
much as possible.
With respect to tho Philippine Is
sue, the Clarrlson resignation has
sorved to enhance the chance of tho
Clarlro oineudmont to the self-government
bill, adopted by the sennte, and
providing for complete independence

amendment is unwise at this time.
Secretary Garrison was bitterly op
posed to the amendment. Tho house

sideration and conferences with tho
f.xecutivo have been hold 03 tho sub
ject, all tending to strengthen the
prospects for passage of the amend
ment. In tho senate this week tho Nicara

German attacks of varying intensity
on various parts of tho French and
British line from Belgium to the Vos

days of great activity on the western
front. The attacks ranged from
minor encounters between recounoil

ndes to assaults preceded by exten
sive artillery preparations and car
ried out by considerable bodies of
troops. Tho most vigorous of these
offensives were in Champagne and in
the region north of Arras, where there
has been almost constant figating for
days. Tho greatest gain claimed by
the Germans, they say, was made be

ARSENIC FOUND IN THE SOUP
Chicago Police Official Gives His
Views of the Plot to Poison Two

Trail of Jean Crones.
Chicago, Feb. 14. "I do not wion.
to create a panic in Chicago," was the
reply of First Deputy Superintendent
of Police Schuettler when askeu to
give his views of the plot to poison
200 prominent Chlcagoans at tho ban
quet Thursday night in honor of Arch
bishop George W. Mundelein. Schuet-
er refused to admit that he believes

Crones was only a unit among a gang
of anarchists who planned to wipe out
a distinguished group of men, appear
ed to be borne out from activities of
his staff of detectives. About two
hours before Commissioner Robertson
gave out the report of F. O. Tonney,
city chemist, that 3.7 grains of white
oxide arsenic had been found In an
analysis of a pint of the poisoned
soap served at the banquet to the
Archbishop, two anarchists were tak
en Into Schuettler's office.
They were confronted with tran
sclpts of speeches taken down by
Schuettler's investigators and by oth
er agents, who have been present at
every secret and open meeting of the
revolutionists of Chicago.

When they had gone Schuettler, in-
J on interview, admitted ho has had"
reports on Crones for several months.
He knows the meetings Crones had
attended and what he said at those
meetings. He admitted Crones is a
"dyed in the wool" anarchist, and
tliat he knows his associates.
Schuettler found that Crones, at a.
meeting of the anarchists last May.
asked the speaker If his study of
chemistry he is an amateur chem
ist would injure his standing In the
anarchist movement. The speaker's
I Search of Crones' room brought to
light the rrmes of two of his asso
ciate'? and their addresses. One man
is a Xew Yorker and the other lives
in Scranton.
From tho report of the city chem
ist it appears th"t only the uractlcef
of serlnc small dishes of souns ind
consomme a 21 exclusive banquet
saved the lives of the dinner guests.
Commlssionpr Robertson declared
that two grains of arsenic is tho
smallest poisonous dos-3. The dinner
guests, ho said would have had to
have eaten eif.ht and a half ouiirrs
of the poisoned soup in order for any
fatalities to "nave resulted. Mr. Ton
rey estimated that forty-eipht grains
of arsenic had been placed in the bu
kettle. It was also stated that a bot
