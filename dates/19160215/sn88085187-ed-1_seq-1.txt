THE ONLY INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER IN TACOMA.
SHALL STATE
TAKE LIFE OF
MRS. WARREN?
WINSTON SAI.EM. H. C, Feb. I:.. —Shall a white woman pay
tlie death penalty In North Carolina?
Tho answer, which (iov. Craig will Rive, is being awaited
i breathlessly not only in North Carolina, but in many cities of
America!
For thousands of persons have already signed petitions for
Mrs. Ida Ball Warren, sentenced to die in the electric chair Mar. 3
for the murder of her husband, J. G. Wairen.
A fight for her life is now ».«.•-■««, -ir.^nl by the Anti-
Capital Punishment society.
This state has never yet allowed a woman to pay the extreme
penalty, but tlie details of the murder * rhWMd to Mrs. Warren ate
tegarded so horrible the Rtate's record may be broken now!
Convicted with Mrs. Wairen ia Samuel Preston Christy of Texas,
sentenced to die tlie same day as Mrs. Warren, and Clifford Stor.e
street, her son-in-law, sentenced to prison as an aceesory.
The story of the murder rivals lurid fiction.
Christy stated, on trial, that he met Ida Hall in Winston-Salem
in 1908 and they lived as man and wife. Introducing themselves as
I "Mr. and Mrs. Kearns." In 1!) 11, he said, they went to Texas where
the woman opened a boarding house and Christy worked as a ra'l-
I road section hand.
In lilt, according to the story, J. Q. Warren, a railroad worl'
i er, came to live at tlie boarding house and a short time later he and
tlie woman eloped, taking Christy's savings
( ln-istj Haiti he trucked them a month, carrying; a re
volver and ready to slay the man. I nsiictessful, he returned
to Texas, married, and was living, happily until a letter
I from Ida Hall, who was tlien legally married to Warren,
asked him lo come to her. He left his Initio, according to
his story, and went to "tlie other woman."
In Winston-Salem, where the Warrens were living, Christy,
boarded with Stonestreet. He said the woman told him she wanted
! to get rid of her husband, that they planned his murder and executed
it Aug. 18.
Mrs. W>irreu tesMled that on the morning of the mur
der she awakened earlier than her husband and placed a
handkerchief, soaked in chloroform o*er hi- lace. Then,
she said, she called Christy and he st ranged Warren to
death.
It was testified Christy and Stonestreet placed the body in n
trunk, took it eight miles in a cab to Muddy Creek, where they
bruised the face to make it unrecognizable, tied weights to the body
and sank it.
Fishermen found the body, caught by driftwood, after a heavy
rain swelled the stream.
Christy testified he and Mrs. tYarren went to the
morgue to see if the btKly could he recogni/.ed, but did not
Identify Itl
Several months after the body was buried, parents of Warren,
investigating his disappearance from Texas, had the body exhumed
and identified it.
Christy left Mrs. Warren a few months after the murder and
i was located in Grand Saline, Texas. After trial, the case was taken
to the supreme court where Chief Justice Clarke sustained the lower
■ court, pronouncing the murder the most brutal that ever came to
1 his notice.
Christy is facing death stoically.
Mis Warren has become convened and says she is en
couraged by tlie fight being made to save her on account of
1 her sex.
