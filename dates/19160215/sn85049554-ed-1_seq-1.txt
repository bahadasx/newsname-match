translating, certain ringleaders in a
jft j,conspiracy which is said to be Interna
jnTVtlonal in scope, have headquarters In
pfRome, Italy. He added that some of
Spgthe letters contained detailed descrlp
*ttons of bombs used by the conspir

signed to wreck buildings, others to kill
policemen, and still others to spread

Over Political
Aspects of War
London, Feb. 15.—A general con
ference ol| the allies In Paris to
consider all political aspects of the
war Is to be held. Announcement
to this effect was made In the
houBe of commons today by Pre
mier Asquith.
Premier Asqulth'a statement was
made In the course of an address
In the house of commons In con
nection with the opening of par
liament.
The premier stated that the sit
uation of the British forces In
Mesopotamia, which has been a
source of concern, had improved
materially, and that General
Townsend, whose army Is sur
rounded by the Turks at Kut-El
Amura, was holding his own.
The premier thought there was
every ground for hoping the forces
of General Townsend and General
Aylmer, commander of the relief
expedition, might unite and that
everything In the nature of a ser
ious (British check might be
averted.
He announced that the govern
ment was now taking stock of all
Its munitions, men, finances and
Industrial reserves, so as to be in
a position to put forth. Its maxi
mum strength.
might lead to the early arrest of the
anarchist.
"Committee of Fifteen" Known.
Names of the "committee of fifteen"
are said to be In the hands of the po
lice, and it was predicted that the ar
rest of some of the committee members
would 'be made before night.
In connection with the alleged plans
of the reputed conspirators here to de
stroy public buildings and church
property, It was pointed out two score
or more Chicago churches have suf
fered fire losses within the lost few
years. At the Moody church, it was
said, no less than six fires, obviously
of Incendiary origin, have been dis
covered and extinguished with small
loss during the past year alone. Other
churches, In which Incendiary fires

With Girl's Murder.

MADISON STORE
Poison Crystals Found in Ash Heap in
Cellar of Orpet Horn*—Gardener
8ays Poison Had Been Used to Kill
Inseots on 8hrubbery—Orpet and
His Attorneys Continue to Reiterate
His Innocenee.
Chicago, Feb. 15.—William H. Orpet,
University of Wisconsin student,- ac
cused of poisoning his former sweet
heart, Marian Frances Lambert, whose
frozen body was found In the woods of
Lake Forest last week, changed his
story toay, according to State's Attor
ney Dady, and admitted buying an
empty bottle from a Madison, Wis.,
drug store Just before going to keep
a tyrst with the girl in the north shore
wood.
Failure to find any poison contalnep
near the scene of the girl's death has
puzzled the authorities. In the opin
ion of the prosecutor, Orpet's admis
sion today strengthens the case against
him.
Chicago, Fob. 15.—Search for the
bottle in which was carried the poison
which caused the death of [Marian
Frances Lamlberrt, Lake Forest high
school girl, was continued today by
detectives, who are endeavoring to es
tablish a connection between the girl's
death and the mysterious absence from
Madison, Wis., of William H. Orpet,
University of Wisconsin Junior.
The assertion by the police that a
drug clerk in 'Madison admitted he had
sold Onpet an empty ibottle and the
finding of poison crystals In an ash
heaip in the cellar of the Orpet home,
are the principal developments of the
past forty-eight hours In the Lake
Forest mystery.
Poison Proaonoo Explained.
A gardner on the 'MoCormlck estate
of whioh Orpet's father is 'Caretaker,
Is said to have admitted putting the
poison in the aah heapw This was ex
plained by the elder Orpat by the
statement that the poison had been
to kill ^iftSMf*, on ..•britbtoc^y but
tjr" M1 rendered'
it useless.
State's Attorney Dady, of Lake
county, said today he regarded the dis
covery of the poison and the clerk Who
sold the ibottle as the last link In the
chain of circumstantial evidorice by
which he expects to convict Orpet and
said he TOB ready to present hit* evi
dence to the coroner's Jury.
Orpet and his attorneys continue to
reiterate his innocence.
Poison Purchase Revealed.
Just before Orpet left Madison to
hold a clandestine meeting with Mar
ian LamJbert he purchased a two-ounce
bottle.
He had asked the druggist for a
one-ounce capsule and was told they
didn't come that size.
Ralph J. Daddy, state's attorney of
Lake county, and other authorities
engaged In soflvlng the mystery of
Miss Lambert's death in Helm's
Woods, believe Orpet poured a quan
tity of poison Into this bottle, gave
It to the girl to drink—telling her It
was medicine—and that he threw the
phial away as he was going back to
Madison.
Says He's Guilty.
Mr. Dady stated last night that after
a week's Investigation he is certain
the girl was murdered by Orpet, who
feared he might become Involved In a
scandal.
Orpeit and Mjarlan had been sweet
hearts. They had been intimate, and
last fail the girl believed the crisis
had come. She let her supposed con
dition be known to Orpet, and he sent
her a powerful drug.
It made her worse because there
was nothing the matter with her.
She thought 'Mt was not doing the
work," and thru a girl chum again
asked aid of Orpet.
Arranged Meeting.
He wrote, arranging a meeting In
Helm's woods. He rumpled up his
bed so his landlady might not know
he had left Madison. He wrote an
"alibi" letiter, which he gave to a
friend to keep until the following day
—thqn mall it.

spent part of the time in his father's
garage on the MioCormick estate.
The next morning he met the girl.
And the next Been 1 of her she was
dead—poisoned. And nd bottle was
found, altho scores of men and boys
have hunted for It.
Mixture of Poisons.
The poison was a mixture of cya
nide of potassium and sulphuric acid
—sulpho cyanide of potarfh. it topk
a man who knew the nature of tfie
poisons to mix It. Orpet knew the
poisons. His father had introduced
them into Lake Forest as an exter
minator of insects. He had studied
chemistry for a year. He had access
to various poisons in iMadison.
The state's attorney's deteotives say
they have a sworn statement from
Charles W. Htassinger, a drug clerk.
Chat he sold the botUe to drpet on
Tuesday, and that he sold hhm the
other drug last August. Orpet denies
he purchased. any bottis-rdsnles he
