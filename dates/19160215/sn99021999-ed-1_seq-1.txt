What is the present situation in
the different state with reference
to presidential preference?
To what extent have the dele
Bates to the Chicago convention
been already selected, and what Is
the prospect for factional fights or
harmony agreements in the make-up
of the delegations?
What steps have been taken for
calling the state and district con
ventions, or for holding direct prt
n.aries by which delegates are to be
chosen from the different states?
Answers to these questions will
bfc found In the survey of political
conditions throughout the country
on the republican side Just made by

with the editor, Victor Rosewater,
by correspondence with republican
leaders in the different states.

f Thia survey, which covers more
nnn uiiny states, including ail out
four or five of the more important
ones, confirms the general impres
sion. - that the undercurrent for
Hughes as the most available can
didate to unite all elements is strong
everywhere, and that aside from
this, republicau --litlment Is not yet
crystallized noticeably anywhere out
side of the "favorite 1 son states,"
whose delegations are to be given
to the home candidate by common
consent. , i
Owing to new legislation, the ma
chinery of selecting te convention
delegates is late in starting In most
of the states, only two districts, one
In Missouri aijdone In Oklahoma,
having already acted. Conventions
and primaries, however, are soon to
begin and will come fast " in- the
months of March and April, but the
last delegates will not be chosen un
t'l.the day before the convention,

element will undertake to aend a dele

WARNING ALREADY IS
WASHINGTON. Feb. 14. The
United States probably will leave to
future developments whether any
action will be taken In response to
the announcement from the Teu
tonic allies that armed merchantmen
beginning March 1 will be subjected
to submarine attack without warn
ing. From high official quarters today
came the Intimation that the memor
andums received from the German
and Austrian governments are con
sidered in themselves a sufficient
warning to Americans to refrain
from engaging passage'on merchant
ships of the class of vessels affected
by the order.
Germany Offers
Bigger Sum for
Nicaragua Route
WASHINGTON. Feb. J4.-That Ger
many had offered Nicaragua larg-sr sum
than the United States for an option on
tha Nlcargtian Canal rout was urged tn
ths senate todajr as an rgument for early
ratification of the pending treaty.
"Of course, we have heard reports that
Germany souirht to obtain the NlcaraRuan
canal route," said Senator tone, chair
man of the committee. "Whether It of
fered $9,000,000 or SV2.000.000 or 120.000.000, I
do not know. We have no means of know
ing. That Germany was actuated by the
same motives In seeking this canal route
that France had In the original Fanama,
enterprlao Is apparent to every one."
Champions of the pending Nlcaraguan
treaty are said to have olted Germany's
desires in urging its ratification, Nicara
gua having agreed to accept the $3,000,000
offered by the United States for the
canal option and naval base In Fonseca
.bay. ' ;
Senator Stone said late today that he
had. agreed to defer asking for a. vote
on (the treaty imtlV next Thursdays
eraf democratic senators having notified
him that they oould not be present un
til that time. ".
Several senators said they had been In
formed during the course of the, debate
that Germany had long sought an option
on the canal route; that effort first were
made soon after France undertook con
struction of a canal and had been re
newed more recently. Members at the
foreign relations committee denied re
ports that there wan any documentary
evidence in possession of the committee
on the subject.
