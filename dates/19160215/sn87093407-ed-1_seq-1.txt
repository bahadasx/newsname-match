CITY COUNCIL AND CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
MAY TAKE UP FIGHT FOR FAIR TOURIST RATES
A LL Seattle, thru the city council, will be asked to participate in the fisjht
begun by local business men and commercial organizations to equalize tour
ist rates and bring annually to the Northwest thousands of pleasure-seeking trav
elers. Chairman C. A. Reynolds, of the public service commission, announced this
plan Tuesday as the latest development in the rate campaign.
At the same time, he declared he believed the Chamber of Commerce,
which thus far has held aloof from the light, is preparing to take a prominent
part in it.
This belief is strengthened by the announcement that the transportation
bureau of the chamber has asked the public service commission—Chairman Rey
nolds, Frank R. Spinning and Arthur A. Lewis—to attend a luncheon meeting at
the Butler hotel Thursday noon to discuss the campaign.
"Some mighty big people have lined up with us in the last few days," Rey
nolds declared. "They have promised both moral and financial support in a fight
to the finish."
Another mass meeting of citi
zens will be called for some day
next week v to he decided upon at
a meeting of the citizens' commit
tee on Thursday.
Will Expose Kerr's Activities
The purpose of the meeting will
be to expose the "Inside farts"
concerning the publications of Ken
neth Kerr, editor of the Railway
£ Marine News, who has taken up
the cause of the railroads.
Kerr has attempted to delude
the public Into believing tourist
ratee to the Pacific Coast are equal
by quoting rates which have no
bearing on the matter In hand.
Chairman Reynolds and the cltl
zens' committee are sending out
letters Tuesday to all commercial
bodies In every city In this state as
well as those of Portland and
Boise, Idaho, asking permission to
use their cor|>oratc nam< s as par
ties plaintiff In the suit against
the railroads.
To File New Complaint
A change In the plan of bringing
suit against the railroads has
taken place within the last week.
An amended complaint is to be
filed with the Interstate commerce
commission, naming all commer
cial bodies In the Northwest as
parties plaintiff. Instead of having
ea< h file a separate suit In Inter
ventlon to the main suit, brought
by the public service commission.
Expects to Win Case
Ry this method the rommlsslon
hopes to gain unity and bring the
matter more forcibly before the In
terstate rommlsslon.
"There seems to be no doubt
that we will win our rase," said
Reynolds
