CONTINENTAL IDEA
SEEMS ABANDONED
Federalization of Present
Organization Adopted
as Defense Means
Washington, D. C., Feb. 14.—Na
tional preparedness problems again
today held the center of the stage in
congressional committee activity.
Having concluded its hearings on
military defense questions. Chairman
Chamberlain and his associates on the
senate military committee today be
gan framing a bill on the subject.
They were to incorpate In the meas
sure a plan of federalization of the
national guard to create a reserve de
fense force. As their work progresses
the senate committee proposes to con
fer frequently with members of the
house military committee.
Chairman Hay and members of the
house committee resumed today work
of redrafting the house defense bill
to eliminate the continental army fea
ture and place in its stead the plan of
federalizing state troops.
The house naval committee today
began an exhaustive inquiry into sub
marine warfare and the alleged short
comings of American submarines.
Rear Admiral Albert W. Grant, assign
ed by Secretary Daniels several
months ago to command the subma
rine flotilla of the Atlantic fleet, was
ready to take the witness stand and
reveal the results of his close study
of the underwater craft His exami
nation was expected to last well into
the week.
Commander Yates Stirling, who
commanded the fleet last year and
who made startling revelations con
cerning the inefficiency. of the Bttb
merslbles, is expected to follow 'Ad
miral GtanL
At the- present rate, of progress,
Chairman Padgett of the committee
does not believe that the naval ap
propriation bill will be ready to place
before the house until the latter part
of May. The senate naval committee
will not consider the bill until the
house committee hearings are nearlng
an end.
Wants Big Submarines.
Limited cruising radius, unseaworth
iness and other limitations of the coast
defense type off submarines made it ad
visable hereafter to build only sub
mersibles of the 1,000 ton submarine
type of which three have been author
ized and none yet completed, said Ad
miral Grant.
Admiral Grant said he had positive
knowledge that German boats from
U-39 to U-58 inclusive displaced 800
tons on the surface as against 450 tons
for the boats of the American navy,
the largest In the service. For months
the German boats, he said, had operat
ed out of Heligoland around Scotland
at a distance of 1,300 miles from their
base. It took them nine days to make
the round trip, he said, and they re
mained on the operating station thir
teen days unless driven to base sooner
through having used up the torpedo
supply. Three of these boats, he
»aid, could keep the cycle working so
tine was always on the operating sta
tion. To do the same thing, he added,
the United States would require twen
ty-two class boats because of their
ten day sea Service limitation.
Admiral Grant thought it unwise to
construct any submarine of less than
twenty knot speed and said this could
not be done on a small boat. He urged
lhat the minimum size of future boats
be 800 tons' surface displacement.
"I consider ten days to be the limit
ot time men should stay at sea on a
boat, our largest type, and that limit
must be reduced for smaller boats. Ten
lays ls the limit of time a boat can
itay at sea and be at all effective.
Cost Favors Big Ones.
'.i "For months the big German sub
marines operated from Heligoland as a
base around the coast of Ireland, a
round trip of 2,700 miles. If we had no
engine trouble and if the boats
could make twelve knots an hour, it
would require twenty-two boats to
do what three of the 800 ton German
boats did for months. Three

ID OHIO ELECTION
PRESIDENT FORMALLY AN
NOUNCES HIS WILLINGNESS
TO BE CANDIDATE.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 14.—Presi
dent Wilson today formally gave his
consent that his name be used as a
candidate for renomi nation.
In a letter to the secretary of state
of Ohio, the president said he was un
willing to enter a contest for the nom
ination but was ready to permit the
use of his name in the coming prim
ary in order that the democrats of
Ohio might make known their prefer
ence.
The president stated his position in
order to comply with the Ohio prim
ary law which requires candidates
for delegates to the party conventions
to make known their first and second
choices before February 25, and r«t
quires that the candidates for dele
gates have the consent of their choices
to make use of their names.
The president was formally notified
of the Requirements of the law last
week.
Explains His Stand.
President Wilson wrote to Secre
tary of State Hildebrandt of Ohio as
follows:
"While I am entirely unwilling to
enter into any contest for the presiden
tial nomination of the democratic
party, I am willing to permit the use
of my name that the democrats of
Ohio may make known their prefer
ence in regard to that nomination.
"In order, therefore, to satisfy the
technical requirements of the statutes
of the state of Ohio, I hereby consent
to the use of my name as a candidate
for the presidency by any candidate
who seeks to be elected a delegate to
the national convention which is to as
semble in June next."
This was the first time the president
has consented formally to have his
name used in connection with the nom
ination. His name has been placed on
several ballots In several states, how
ever, through the activities of-friends.
The president takes the position
that the voters will have to determine
whether he will make the race for the
presidency in 1916 as the democratic
candidate. In a letter to A. Mitchell
Palmer, then a representative frpm
Pennsylvania, In his inaugaijratloiyMr.
Wilson made it phrtn he would only be
a candidate again if the democratic
voters 'desired It.
Political advisers and friends of the

CALLED MURDERESS.
Winterset, Feb. 14.—Counsel In the
case of Mrs. Ida Meyer, aged 60.
charged with complicity in the murder
of her daughter-in-law, today present
ed their arguments and the case is ex
pected to go to the jury late today or
tomorrow.
It would have been impossible fo"
Mrs. Ethel, the daughter-in-law, to
have killed herself with the revolver
found at her side, County Prosecutor
Phil Wilkinson argued. He insisted
the evidence showed she did not com
mit suicide and that there were only
two other persons in the house at the
time—Mrs. Ida Meyer and Fred Meyer,
the husband. Testimony given by
Fred Meyer and his mother was full of
discrepancies, he charged.
W. S. Cooper, counsel for Mrs.
Meyer, assailed the circumstantial evi
dence offered by the prosecution.
The trial began a week ago today.
The court room has been filled every
day and large crowds have been turn
ed away.
Mrs. Ethel Meyer was found dead in
her home here on July 26 last. Hor
husband was convicted of her murder

CHICAGO'S NEW ARCHBISHOP
WATCHED OVER WHILE AT
RECEPTION.
Chicago, Feb. 14.—First Deputy
Superintendent of Police Herman
Schuettle* said today that he expected
the arrest within a short time of Jean
Crones, assistant chef at the Univers
ity club, who ls suspected of poison
ing the soup served at a dinner given
on Thursday night to Archbishop
Mundelein.
Schuettler and a hundred mountod
officers, detectives and uniformed po
licemen were at a reception given last
night to the archbishop at the Auditor
ium theater. Some of the detectives
guarded the entrances and watched
for notorious radicals whose faces are
known to the officers. Others were
scattered about among the audience
and several were near the prelate at
all times.
John Allegrlnl and Pasquale Ligno,
friends of Crones, are still held by the
police. Examination of the corres
pondence and search of the quarters
of the two men, the polloe said today,
had developed nothing that showed
they had anything to do with the pois
oning.
Empty poison bottles and wrappers
found in the kitchen of the University
club, and the poison shown by analysis
of the soup served at the banquet. In
dicate that the alleged poisoner made
scientific calculations, according to
the authorities, to murder every guest
at the banquet to Archbishop Mundel
ein. The club officials said Crone*
had understood covers were to be laid
for 200 guests, but invitations were
issued for 100 more guests. Two hun
dred and ninety-six in all were pres
ent. That thinned the poison down to
1 2-10 grains of the mineral used for
each guest, or about three-fifths of the
minimum fatal dose. To this the of
ficers attribute the escape from seri
ous results of those taken ill at the
banquet.

ING SWEETHEART.
Chicago, Feb. 14.—The mother of
Marion Lambert, the Lake. Forest high
school girl found dead in the woods
near the suburb last Thursday, has ap
pealed to State's Attorney Ralph Dady
of Lake county to release William H.
Orpet, the University of Wisconsin
junior, held at Waukegan on a charge
of murder. Frank Lambert, father of
the girl, assented to the pleas of bis
wife. The Lamberts told the state's
attorney they had doubt of the guilt
of young Orpet.
State's Attorney Dady was willing ro
admit today that unless he can prove
that Orpet gave his former sweetheart
poison he can not convict the student
of murder.
In sixty letters which passed be
tween the girl and Orpet—thirty-five
written by him and twenty-five by her
—the romance of the two has been
traced from its inception to the time
of the tragedy. The missives show,
the officers say, that alarm was felt
about the girl's condition as early as
last September, but the crisis passed
and their I fears were allayed until
allayed
recently.

Miss Celestia Youker, fiancee of Orpet.

FOR MURDER OF
POULTRY DEALER
NEW YORK OFFICIALS GETTING
EVIDENCE ON TH08E BE
HIND "GUNMEN."
New York, Feb. 14 —A grand Jury
began today to take evidence concern
ing the murder of Barnet Baff, the
poultry dealer who was killed by a
band of gunmen In November, 1914, un
der circumstances which have been
likened in some respects to the murder
of Herman Rosenthal for the Instiga
tion of which Charles Becker was
executed. There has been no hint,
however, that the police are in any
way involved In the Baff case.
It to eharged that Baff was slain as
the result of rivalry In business, that a
fund of $4,200 was collected from about
200 poultry merchant! under the pre
tense that It was to be used in a legal
fight against Baff and that this fund
was used by a "murder steering com
mittee" of twelve men to employ
agents who employed the gunmen who
shot Baff to death.
District Attorney Swann believes he
has enough evidence to send to the
electric chair four men In addition to
some of the gunmen who actually did
the murder. These men are Bald to
have had the distribution of the mur
der fund. The district attorney said
that if It is proved that the twelve
members of the steering committee
knew all the steps taken in the murder
conspiracy each of them would be in
the same legal position as was Becker
In the Rosenthal case.
Many of the poultry dealers who as
sert that they contributed Innocently
to the fund used to finance Baft's mur
der have voluntarily given Information
to the district attorney. Mr. Swann to
day issued an appeal to the other mer
chants who contributed to the fund to
give him the names of the members
of the murder committee.
Much of the evidence thus far ob
tained by the district attorney was
given by Frank Ferrara, who says he
was the chauffeur of the automobile in
which the (unman went to kill Baff
and In which they escaped after the
crime.

ered a warning against overindulgence
in an address to the Young Men's
Christian association. He said that
the heavy diner as well as the heavy
drinker was sure of a short life but
seldom a merry one because the con
ditions under which he lived preclud

or physical well being. But at the top
of the list life shortening habits he
