ANOTHER ROAD
VOTE APRIL 15
Petition With Sufficient Names Is
Presented to County Court and
Judge Takes Action.
In response to a petition signed by
166 voters of Lincoln county, Judge
J. P. Bailey Monday called a special
election, to vote on the question of
issuing bonds to the amount of
$150,000 for road purposes. The
call for the election, fixed the date
on Saturday, April 15th.
Most of the names on the petition
presented to the county court ask
ing for the election were of West
End voters, sentiment in that section
of the county, it is understood, being
particularly strong for road rebuild
ing and reconstruction, on account
of the miserable condition of the
roads in that section. West End
men say however, that in initiating
this campaign for another road bond
election, they were assured of sup
port from other sections of the
county, which ajt the time of the pre
vious election, perhaps did not favor
the proposition so strongly. The
vote at the time of the previous bond
election was 916 against the proposal
to vote bonds and 864 for it, a ma
jority of 52 votes against it. This
vote, however, was only a very small
proportion of the vote of the county,
which is about 4,000, and the advo
cates of road bonds say that they
will be able at the election on April
15th to poll a greatly increased vote
all over the county.
D. W. Dunn, representing the
West End petitioners, brought the
petition here and filed the petition.
GOOD STOCK MARKET MONDAY
Court day was mighty cold but a
good sized crowd came to town not
withstanding. The mercury was
around the zero mark at daybreak
but most of the incoming cattle
traders got here Saturday or Sun
day with their herds, so few suffer- i
ed on the way. There were nearly
1,000 cattle at the Nunnelley stock
yards and Manager T. W. Jones was
kept busy all day. Very few went
away unsold. Best stockers brought
very close to eight cents a pound,
that figure being refused for an ex
tra bunch of black beeves. Other
stuff sold from that figure down, ac
cording to quality and class. A lafge
GOOCH AGAINST STATE-WIDE,
House Settles Question At This Ses
sion of the Legislature.
State-wide prohibition was given
its death blow at the present session
of the Legislature when the House
failed to give the proposition to sub
mit the question to a vote of the peo
ple the necessary three-fifths major
ity. It required 60 votes to pass the
House and it only received 54, the
vote against granting the people the
privilege to vote on the question be
ing 40. Thus the Drys lost out by
lack of six votes.
The debate over the question be-
number of mules were in town, but ' came very warm and considerable
the severe weather kept most of the ! interest was aroused by the votes of
buyers away. Then, too, the disease
which has been killing them off in the
south probably had some effect on
the sales and made the market on hy
brids rather slow as compared with
a few weeks' ago.

LANCASTER SEPARATOR A HIT.
The most remarkable machine for
separating butter from cream ever
exhibited in Stanford, was seen by
large 'crowds at W. H Higgins' store
here Saturday. It is called the Lan
caster Butter Separator, and everv
farmer and farmer's wife who saw
it, pronounced it the greatest labor
saver, and butter saver, in this line,
they have ever seen. Mr. White of
the company which manufactures
these mach'ines in Louisville, super
intended the demonstration, and
showed how it is possible to produce
butter in a minute, and upon the
second occasion, only 52 seconds
were required. Every particle of the
butter is extracted from the cream
through the churning system employ
ed in this patented machine, and the

to act as an executive committee of
the new Chamber of Commerce of

office in the Lincoln Bank building
early Monday morning. In addition
to the officers, President J. C. Mc

of the Committee on Roads; Dr. W.
B. O'Bannon was made chairman of
the Committee on Civic Improve

the Committee on Publicity. Other
members of the committees will be
considered and appointed at the next
meeting Friday night. W. M. Bright,
K. S. Alcorn and S. M. Saufley were
named as a special Committee on
Membership. It was decided that the
initiation fee shall be $1 to be paid

up later as it is felt that a good sized
sum must be raised to start work in
the right way and to keep things
moving afterwards. It was the con
