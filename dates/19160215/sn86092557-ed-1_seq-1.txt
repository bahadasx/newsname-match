Fight For New.Y. M. C. A.
Members Reaches Every
Corner of City.
BIG SIGH WILL TELL
How the Battle Goes Will Be
Indicated by Colored
Lights.
The fight for new members which is
being waged by the rsd anil blue teams
of the Y. M. C. A. was Blurted oft last
evening at a dinner served to the mem
bers of both teams.
Today there are dozens of enthusi
astic Reds and a like amount of Blue3
chaRing over the city with a pack of ap
plication blanks and a fountain pon
?each. An application blank is hand
ed to a prospect and the top takeD off
the pen and the prospect ordered to
sign "here."
It is hard work for the young men
who have never sold insurance or can
vassed for any line to get the right
twist to their orders to sign "here,"
but all the same the aggressiveness al
ready shown is having it's effect.
The good points characteristic of the
Y. M." C. A. are being told over and
over again by members of each team,
and from the way the sugeitlon is pre
ferred It is almost Impossible to resit
diging Into one's posckets (or the price
of membership.
The whole city seems to have been
taken In by the flood of enthusiasm
and there seems to be no corner which
has not been taken care of in the sys
tem mapped out for covering the town
by Secretary J. W. Kight.
Bed and Blue triangles worn by Y.
M. C. A. members are to be seen ev
erywhere about the city and It seems
that there certainly must bo more than
1,400 of them already.
The Reds,and Blues also want to
see each other wearing waiter's aprons
which those who lose will have to do.
This will be at the banquet which Is
to be given to th? -new-members and
to the winners and their lady friends
when the campaign is over.
All eyes will be cast toward the huge
olgn "Y. M. C. A." on top of the build
ing here tonight to ascertain just how
the race is going. The Reds today
claim that there will be very little
blue in the lettering of the sign. The
Blues say that if there is any red at
all it will be because some blue cam
paigner fell down on the job.
The letters Y. M. C. A. tlralght are of
red and blue lamps. Should the reds
be winning they will get an extra lamp
put in one of the blue letters and vice
versa. The sign will servo as an In
dicator for those who are anxious to
know at the end of each day's work
which Bide Is leading in the number
of new memberships.

Wants Politicians
to Pick Generals
FRENCH EDUCATOR HA8 A LIT
TLE THEORY ABOUT ARMY
PROMOTION.
PARIS, Jan. 31.?(Correspondence
of The Associated Press)?Prof. Aul
ard, distinguished for his historical
studies on the French revolutionary
period, has a theory on the possibility
of discovering military leaders of tal
ent, possibly some of genius, among
young officers and men who are pre
vented by the hierarchical system in
all armies from disclosing any partic
ular latent gift of generalship.
"When France alone was facing in
1793 the most formidable European
coalition she has ever withstood sin- j
glehanded," says Prof. Aulard, "she
saved by the appearance of excep
tional generals, such as Hoche, Jour
dan, Moreauand finally Bonaparte.
Their talents were discovered by a
system of close observation on the
part, not only of the Deputies with of
ficial missions, but by the personal
contact of members of the Govern
ment with the troops. By mixing and
talking with the men, those officers
who had their confidence and arounsed
their enthusiasm were discovered. Ad
vancement was then of the swiftest.
Lazaro Hoche, for example, who In'the
beginning of 1793 was a simple cap
tain. was appointed brigadier-general
In the autumn of the same year at 25
years of age." ? - .
Prof. Aulard declares that a similar
system for the advancement of new
men In the army would be both possi
ble and desirable today. But It would
be necessary that members of the
Government personally to survey the
troops in rfction, as Carnot, Minister
of War, and Saint?Just did in 1793
4. ' v ? ?. '
It might seem that experiment with
new leaders entails a greater risk to
day than in former times, when armies
were counted by thousands Instead of
by millions, but Prof. AulaVd Is in
clined to the contrary.
"A pitched battle, lost or won a
hundred years' ago,"-.said -he, , "could
and generally did, decide the fate .of
a campaign, whereas .today;, with
trench warfare and thetdeflnltemeans
of elaborating-i' defensive . action,
fcKure tovaucceea^tn^adopting-jew
plans of offensive, an'4 ;poasibly,' pot
ting -new.leaders to the test would not
necessarily spell dlsastsr."
WYOMING PLAN WOULD GIVE 320,000
SCHOOLBOY CADETS TO UNCLE SAM!
Three hundred twenty thousand boys between the ages of 13 and
19 would be getting regular military training in this country annually
in conjunction with their school work if all states provided for cadet
?work similar to that given in Wyoming high schools.
The high school populati n of the United States In 1914-15 was
1,134,774.- Approximately 47 per cent of these students were boys.
A five-year test In Cheyenne high school has shown that 60 per
cent of the boys enrolled list for cadet work which Is non-compul
sory. Sixty per cent of the 533,343 boys in ail the high schools of the
nation would be 320,996.
If cadet work was made compulsory the United-States could have
more than half a million boys under training constantly.

Put Out a Real Fire In En
gine Room of the Bat
tleship North Dakota.
(Br Associated Prcssl
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 15.?Quick
work by the sailors on the battleship
North Dakota at pie Phlladelphl navy
yard saved the ship from serious dam
age by Are last night. They jumped
from bunks at the sound of the Are
alarm and extinguished a slight blaze
in engine room in about three min
utes.
The Are was starte by the blowout
of a fuze in a dynamo. Oil caught Are
and ignited the wood work. An alarm
was sounded and when sailors dis
covered that oil was ablaze they grab
bed bags of sand which are kept In
the room for such emergency and
threw the sand on the burning Auid,
putting out the Are.
The Are was a good test of the ef
ficiency of the Are drill of the various
war ships. At frequent intervals the
Are alarm is sounded and sailors re
spond to it as promptly as if there was
a Are.
Nice Social Fight
In Depths of Mine
Chas. Demico and Paul Poleskl work
In Jamison Mine No. 8. Yesterday
they were back In one of the headings
where one of the men Is a loader and
shovels the coal Into the big steel
cars, while the other Is a driver and
hauls the cars away after they are
loaded.
Charley and Paul disagreed and
quarreled over their work. Paul al
leged that Charley attacked him with
one of the heavy safety lamps used
In the Jamison njlnes. But as there
were no witnesses the only fact thaf
could be determined In Justice Tooth
man's court at Farmington last night
was that there had been a hard flght
in which both combatants onjoyod
themselves to the utmost. Charley
was Aned $10, and Paul $5.

DDI SSI FOR NEW
?UK HEARING
It\Vill Take Place February
24?Hurrying Bill in
<- Congress.
The project for a new bride over the
Monongahela River at Jefferson street
will be the subject of a
public hearing at the Cham
ber of Commerce rooms February 21
at 1 o'clock. This is the time set by
the United States Engineer at Pitts
burgh. The plans may be seen bt the
Engineers Office in Pittsburgh and
since the Monongahela at this point
is a navigable stream the building of
a bride requires not only the approval
of the U; S. Engineers but a special
act of Congress to permit the obstruc
tion of the traffic on the river.
Any one who has any objection at
all of the proposed bridge may file
their complaint with the Engineer on
February 24. Francis R. Shunk, who
Is the Lieutenant Colonel of the
Corps of Engineers at Pittsburgh will
he here on tha? day to receive the ar
guments for and against the bridge.
The bill to authorize the building of
the bridge is now before the House
and according , to Congressman Neely
will be passed this week. Then In. a
short time it will be rushed through
the Senate by Senator Chilton, so it
may be signed and go into effect by
the time the actual construction of the
bridge Is ready to begin.
