.May 1, 1916, was the time limit for
the taking over of "Hardscrabble" in a
resolution offered this morning in City
Council by Park Commissioner E. Z.
Gross.
Council thought the time was a
trifle too short, aud upon the sugges
tion of Commissioner Harry F. Bow
man definite action was postponed for
a week.
Mr. Gross offerer! his resolution at
the request of City Solicitor D. S. Sett*
in accordance with the latter's letter
on the subject.
Suggests June 30 or July I
Xo probable time was stated by
Mr. Bowman in moving for postpone
ment of action, although he said after
the meeting that he believed June 30
or July 1 would be more satisfactory.
By extending the time to this date, he
said, not only would more opportunity
be allowed for the citizens in (hat sec
tion to find other quarters, but the city
would probable be in better position to
bear the financial burden of interest
payment on the bonds. Fellow-coun
cilrnen were also of the opinion that
more time should be allowed and Mr.
Cross offered no objection to Mr. Bow
man's motion. "We'll all have to get
together on this matter before we de-
dde on the time definitely," said
Mayor Meals. This attitude was
echoed by Commissioner Lynch.
The amount of bonds that would
have to be filed will be double the
amount of the damages to be awarded.
Approximately this will be $214,000 or
$215,000.
Mr. Scit/.'s Views
In calling Council's attention to the
fact that twenty-one of the property
owners in the "Hardscrabble" district
had filed exceptions and appeals to the
viewers' report Mr. Seitz says:
"It will probably take a year at least
to reach a final determination by the
fppellate courts of the questions raised
on test cases that may be selected. In
the meantime the improvement may
be proceeded with by furnishing the
parties in interest with sufllcient se
curity for the properties taken, injured
or destroyed.
"If. in your judgment, the physical
opening of the street should be con
summated as speedily as possible, 1 re
spectfully suggest that you adopt the
enclosed resolution, directing the un

In recommending the change to
Council, Commissioner Bowman this
morning explained how readily the
people could be given the advantage
of the generous earnings of the water
department, and how even with the
big decrease in the year's income that
would result from the change in
rates, the department will show u
large earned balance at the close of
the present year.

Furthermore the city water depart
ment debt this year will be entirely
wiped out.
The new rates are already in effect,
having become operative January 1.

fit of the change when they receive

establishing of the new rates. To be

'Chicken' Flotilla Armed

nine craft, decked In war paint, that
bear down on the Jack Tars at the
League Island Navy Yard with the
avowed intention of taking the jolly
man-o'-war'smen prisoners, will have
to veer away and tack anew, for Lieut.
Commander L. P. Davis has declared
war against this type of cruiser,
known as the "chicken" flotilla.
Not satisfied with abolishing spoon
ing on the gundecks and other forms
of love ashore for the fellow who has
been afloat, this enemy of Cupid has
raised an edict against other types,
which went into force yesterday.
Craft that come to League Island
stripped for action with lipsticks and
vanity bags, powder puffs and per
oxide turrets will be repelled at the
gate. Commander Davis has issued
orders to the sergeants and their corps
to the sergeants and their corps of
guards to look every girl over that

If she shows checks that have been

black pencil has supplied an aid that
nature denied, out they go. "Chick
ens" are taboo, and, while the naval
city is open for inspection of the fair
ones, the one whose real complexion
is submerged will not get a berth in
