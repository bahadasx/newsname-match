of t'ne legislature of 1916, though
there is a possibility ihat the session

body early in the week, and the appropriation

Idles Chaining Bill
Tlie Liles cnaingang bill, as it has
^ CGme to be called is ready for ratification.
The senate amended the bill
^ so as to make it apply only to convicP*
tions on selling liquor, eliminating
transporting and stoding. The house
concurred in tne senate amendment
so that the act as it will go on the
Prv y
statute books makes tne pena* l> 1UI
> selling liquor a straight chaingang
. sentence without the alternative of a
fine, and the punishment for trans-porting
and storing remains as a1
present.
As was stated in the last issue oi
The Herald and News, the senate has
voted to cut down the amount ol
liquor which may be ordered in any
one month to two quarts, but would
all-jar 60 pints of beer in lieu of the
t wo quarts. The house has yet to act

on this amendment, ine UUUSC uui.
night last week decisively voted down
a bill to except beer from the provisions
of the gallon-a-month law.
Directs Against Southeastern.
A good deal of the legislation ol
rhe session has bee$i revolving arounc
the State warehouse system, and the
insurance feature in the system. A
i* resolution was intdoduced in the sen*ate
to require the commissioner *c
? fnrnfs.h nanes of the companies from
I which he has secured his low rates
F on State warehouse cotton. The reso|
lution was emphatically voted down
I deceivin only six votes. In his annual
I report the commissioner charged that
> the insurance trust, of which the
1 Southeastern Tariff association is a
I part, waited the information for pur,
-poses not friendly to the system, and
| condemned the Southeastern Tarifi
-- iM/\lotinn
I association as a comume m
of the federal anti-trust laws and oi
the constitution of the State. On Saturday
morning the senate passed a
bill, introduced by Senator Laney tc
prohibit insurance combinations in the
State, which would have the effect ol
? dissolving the Southeastern, so far as
South Carolina is concerned.
There are bills in both houses tc
authorize the warehouse commissioner
io act for parties in the State seeking
insurance on any kind of property
f These insurance measures have created
wide-spread interest, and are
causing a great deal of activity
among the insurance people.
Employers' Liability Measure.
The house has given final passage
to the senate bill defining the liability
of railroads for injuries to employes.
The house amended the bill so as tc
ft exclude the recovery of punitive lamages
under the act. It now goes to
the senate for concurrence in the
amendment. The measure conforms
to the federal statue.
New Circuit Created.
This legislature has created a new
judicial circuit, and if the act is approved
by Gov. Manning, South Car
clina will have 14 judicial circuits, inBj
stead of 13, as at present. 'The ac;
leaves Charleston in a circuit by herself.
and puts Hampton, Beaufodt.
: f Colleton and Jasper counties in a new
14th circuit. A motion to strike out
C the enacting words, made by Senator
Wrightman of Saluda, was killed by
H r: vote* or 10 to 21.
Ir Inheritance Tax Killed.

, It was held out in *ain that the in- '
j heritance tax was just in that it would
j levy a tax on intangible property. 1
such as stocks ana .bonds, while t'ne
(
"poor devil with a mule and house1
hold furniture'' is taxed out of pro'
portion. The bi.l. in substance in- '
dorsed by the State tax commission, [
provided for tile exemption from taxation
of a widow's inheritance to the
amount of $i0.000 an 000 for each
child. '
There ought to be~ an inheritance [
. tax law in Soutn Carolina, and it is
; hard to understand why some measure '
> of this kind can not get through the '
-general assembly. The late Mr. Geo. 1
R. Rembert. as a member of the (
house from Richland coun.'y, made
: an earnest fight several years ago for
a law of this kind. Such a law 1

not prevent school districts from receiving

ate was discontinued until Monday 1
night. Leading these is tne group of

THE IDLER. ^
<?> <?>
My, my, Bob of The State?pardon
me for my familiarity?but have you j
seen that that there legislature is
talking about reducing the allowance
to two quarts a month and maybe only
one. Have you written that there [
note to them about increasing the al- j
'owance of beer and wine? If not, j
get busy, old pal?excuse me again, j
If they are going to keep on reducing!
it I think the best thing would be to j
cut it out for all purposes and let the
old State have straight and unadul
terated prohibition?the real thing.
?o? j
1 was reading the other day in some |
newspaper where a Rev. Mr. Diffen- j
bach, a Unitarian minister, preached
a sermon on "Our Debt to the Press.''
He declared, the article says, that the j
newspaper men held the greatest pow- i
er for good of all men not excepting ;
the ministers of the gospel. Then the J
article continues:
He declared that the newspaper, if i
well regulated, was an ally of religion !
and that it had contributed more than .
anything else to the abolition of sects,
though it occasionally would exploit
controversies as it did comparatively j
recently in Hartford.
On the other hand, Mr. Diffenbach
mentioned some of the faults of the
average paper such as the "delicious
fictions," "sacred cow," "twisting of j
i'acts" and "exploitation of passsion j
for the purpose of boasting circula-!
tion.''
He declared further that finished
in npursnaners had become!
r r almost
a arity. "Journalism cannot |
flourish when money making is its {
goal." he said. "You can't make money !
out of the big services to humanity, j
I don't know why you can't but yoii |
can't."
Three periods in American journal- j
wprp outlined bv Mr. Diffenbach. j
:T.he first period, lie said, was that of
the elder Bennett, who put the news- i
paper on a business basis; the sec-,
ond, that of Dana, who brought the I
art of writing into journalism, and the
third, that of Pulitzer, who introduc- j
ed into journalism the age of exploit-1
ing the crowd and of stri-ving for sen-;
sation. H'e quoted figures alleging that j
of news investigated, 23 per cent, was |
J ? 17 nor r?pnt unwhole- !
ueiuuicu 1&IU&, 11 ~ ^?,
some, 21 per cent, trival, and 39 percent
worth while.
I quote this article to. call attention
to one sentence or two in it. Listen
to this: "You can't make money out
of big services to humanity. I don't;
know why you can't but you can't." j
Now, had you ever thought of that?
And isn't it strange, but if you will
stop long enough to think about it for
a minute, and of the men and the
?-T ? iio-ira Irnrvwn and
women wuuui vuu no.?^ ..^
read about, you will conclude that it
is true. It is a great consolation to
me?pardon me. I am not vain?but
I have been doing big things for humanity.
and I know now why I have
never made money. The truth is tliar
those who are engaged in doing big
things for humanity never stop long
enough in their work to think about
money, and, therefore, they never have
any worth while. Especially is this
true of the country newspaper man.
"Journalism cannot flourish when
money making is its goal." Well, I
am not a journalist, but I know I
would never get rich writing this column,
because I have been doing it
long enough now to have a little
something, but the trouble is the editor
never thinks about including me
:n the weekly pay roll. Somebody j
must serve humanity, and I reckon it
just as well be me as anyone else.
?o?
But this was not all that I quoted
this statement for. Thing of statistics
that the gentleman gives on the in-J
rwf thn ripu-c that is nublished I
nucuvyc; vi cue **v ? ^ ? A? and
passed on for news. Only 39 per
cent of it is worth while. Twentythree
per cent demoralizing and seventeen
per cent unwholehome. Wonder
if he means by that.when he says
that the press is more powerful even
than gospel ministry to say that such
?-? __
a large proportion of the sermons are
unwholesome. 1 don't think so. I am
no newspaper person, but I have always
thought tnat many of our papers
printed too much crime and too much
of the detail of crime. I reckon they
do it because that is the sort of stui
the people want, and the newspaper
makers want to sell teir papers and.
give their readers the kind of diet
they want. But then I don't know
much about it anyway, and I reckon
I had better try to write about something
of which I know. And yet if I
did I reckon I would be like a good
many others who try to write, I would
not write i\ery much.
Talking about newspapers reminds
me that 1 read another article from
some one else on the point that it
would pay the churches ao advertise
their services. Here it is. Read it.
And then some of the merchants might
take heed.
"The time seems to be approaching
when business men in churches will
insist upon business methods in
church1 work," says Xorcross in the
"Church and Clergy" column of the
Philadelphia Public Ledger. "Instead
of a three, five or ten-line 'notice' in
the newspaper, announcing the services
and the minister's topics, they
will nave 100-line, and often 500-line
display advertisements, which ?very
newspaper reader will see and read
with interest. It requires no prophet
to predict that within 10 years most
- ^ i A M /v AC wrvll O /I
OX our tiUlCl pi lOMJg *-Uu i wics ty ni a.u?
vertise their services in large type,?
"Some will ask the question: 'Does t
it pay to advertise a church?' It does.
Xo one can estimate the value of the
souls that may be saved through the
medium of this advertising; but there
are more practical results which will
appeal to practical church officials.
A young minister of'North Philadel
phia, who has astonished cnurcnmen
by his publicity methods, brought two
of the wealthiest families of his district
into\his church by means of his
newspaper campaign. These families
make a handsome contribution to the
current expenses of that congregation.
And newspaper advertising did
it."
I ft
?O?
Now I quote this because I think
it is true, and because there are those
among the ministry and among the
laymen who do not think it right or
in good taste for a minister or pastor
to advertise his services, or even the
services of the church. I am not one
of those who believe any such thing.
I believe in publicity of the right kind
and in this age the man or the cause
?-1- fa nnK1/? ia
Lna L IS ULOL ncpi ucivi c iiuuiv
going to be lost in^the shuffle. The
successful merchant is the one who
knows how to advertise.

P. S.?Say. please let me have anv
other word to my stuff for this week.
I have just* read in the News and
Courier of (Thursday that the senate
on Wednesday night passed an amendment
to trie liquor bill and sent it to
the house allowing a monthly stipend
of five dozen pints of beer. Just think
of that, it is sixty pints a month. Two
every day. Now. Bob, you of The
State, I am sure you wrote that note,
though I see that my own dear senator
from Xewberry lead the fight
against that amendment. Just think
of that, will you, and when I have
been such a fool about them Johnstones
all my life. Well, the point
now is, write a note to them mem-'
bers over in the house and see if they
will agree to the senate amendment
and the country will be safe yet. It is
Just like one of the senators said, I
believe t'ne one from Charleston, such
an amendment is in the interest or
real temperance. Way the members
of the house come to their wits also.
