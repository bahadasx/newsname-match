EXPLAINS WHY MEN
ARE GROWING BALD
Thousands of men are growing bald
every day and don't know the reason
why. Many of them never expect to
eave even what hair is left.
This is indeed a pity, Bays a
specialist because baldness usually
femes from carelessness and anyone
who gives the scalp a little attj,'-u
, hnnl.l olu'iva tin vp An nhnnd.lli. tv
" - " '
good healthy hair. Dust and di. 'fe
help to cause baldness by clogging the
pores in the acalp and giving the
dandruff germs fertile ground for
breeding. . v
The treatment is very simple:
Shampoo at least once in ten days and
destroy the dandruff germs by apply
ing frequently Parisian Sage, a de
lightfully efficient' preparation that
W. "L. Gokay is now recommending as
the eure'st treatment to stop falling
hair, to-remove dandruff and to re
fresh? and invigorate the hair roots.
The cost of a generous s bottlo of
Parisian' Sage' is very little and drug
gists everywhere have been authoriz
ed to otfer.lt with guarantee of per
fect satisfaction or money returned.

LOUIS NORTHQUSE
WAS 85 YEARS
OLD MONDAY
Was a Forty-Miner, Pony-Express
4 Rider and Prospector
STARTS SbfH YEAR BY WORKING
Hale and Hearty, He Remembers All
His Experiences In Early Cali
fornia Days.
One of Bennington's most pic
turesque characters is Louis North
ouse, who on Monday celebrated his
85th ' birthday. The friends of Mr.
Northouso at the Putnam houso
where he makes his home, presented
him' with a large-sized' cake in honor
of the event and several old acquain
tances in the village called during the
day to extend congratulations.
Few men in Bennington have lived
so long and had the life-experience up
on which Mr. Northouse can look
back. Few also retain so vivid a
memory of the events they have
passed through. Undoubtedly if Mr.
Northouso could write his life-story,
it would make the current fiction
magazines look palo and insignificant.
German emigrant, forty-niner, pony
express rider, prospector, store keep
er in the California mountains during
the picturesque days of the gold fev
er, tobacco buyer in Cuba in the days
of the Civil war, he has been all of
these, even to being left to dio in a
cock-pit on the isthmus of Panama
yet living to 85 to tell the tale and
good for a dozen years more.
Mr. Northouse came from Germany
when a lad of six. , His father was
dead and the mother settled in New
York. He learned the trade of cigar-
maker and front the"beh'ch he went to
Suffleld, Conn., where he became Inter
ested in the growing of tobacco In
SufReld he worked for the grandfath
er of Calvin and -FhlHp Endress and
formed au acquaintance with the Un
dress family which has lasted over ."0
,'earlv .. . v ,. : . .-,.. .'-'
After, the gpld fever of. "49 struck
the country .Mr., Northouse returned
to New rYork. and. backed by a New
York tobacco and wholesale house,
made plans to go to the Pacific coast
and 'open a branch. He left by ship,
down the Atlantic coast to Panama,
across the isthmus.-by, mule- back and
taking a boat on the west coast, went
up to San Francisco. There were
then but two brick buildings in San
Francisco and Die rest of the great
city were wooden shacks filled with
men from all parts of the world,
crazed by the gold hunt.
He opened the store and shortly af
terward it was destroyed by fire.. As
there were no insurance companies
Jn those days, the store and -goods
were a tolul loss. The company in
New York subsequently sent him a
second stock of goods and in less
than am year the same thing had hap
pened again.. Then Mr. Northouse be
came a pony express rider, carrying
the mails .up Into the nountain min-

ing camps through a country infested
with wild animals and prowling In
dians. His expriences on these trips were
many times hair-raising. The M
diaus were more or less peaceable
unless they had been maltreated or
were intoxicated. Once on one of
these trips Mr. Northouse found his
path obstructed by a monster grizzly
bear. The trail ran along the ridge
of a mountain, too narrow to turn
hack. He was about to abandon his
horse, leave it prey to the animal and
take to his heels, when Mr. Bear
wagged his head a few times and
saved Mr. Northotise's life by sliding
off through the brush. I
After his pony express days he op
ened a little store of his own in the
mountains and sold candy, cigars and
a few groceries. But the call of
prospecting got Into IiIb blood and ho
joined another man on a gold hunt.
A few weeks of sleeping on the snow
and other hardships turned him back
to San Francisco. There he took up
his trade again, never knowing whet

large and influential and Mr.. North

buyer.' " lib 'was there at about the
time of the Civil war. On one of his
trips across the lsthumus of Panama
he was stricken with a tropical
disease and was abandoned in a Mexi
can cock-pit. The captain or the ship
on which he was to have continued
his journey left him to die. An em
phatic appeal to the American con
sul get him taken aboard and the sea
air brought about his recovery.
Shortly after the war Mr. Northouse
came to Bennington and bought a
farm, intending to live In the east the
rest of his lite.; He. married Mrs.
Marietta MHlington. of . this, village
who diod IS years ago. They had no
children, but his wife had a great

Mr., Northouse' has left Bennington
Beveral times as his business called
him to different parts of the country,
but has always returned here, where
he has made many friends. Despite
his age lie is in full possession of all
his faculties and when the weather
permits, takes his daily walk to the
monument and back. . The ; present
winter has been a hard one for him to
withstand as the old complaint which
nearly 'caused his death on the
isthmus, frequently attacks him In
cold 'weather. He is always ready to
tell his old friends nbout his experi
ences and is one of the few of whom

BENNINGTON'S FIRST BARBER
He Also Msde Wigs for Distinguished
Citizens! ' .
.Editor' Evening Banner: , . .
'Tho article in Saturday's Banner on
barbering in Rennlngton thirty
years ago and today was of interest
as Bhowlng how the business is con
ducted at present. The article states
that the first ehopa were naturally in
Bennington Center and that their
history is. lost in legend and myth.
That is undoubtedly true to a large
extent, but fortunately, tho name of
the first professional barber in this
town In known. His name was David
Coude. lie came from Albany and
opened a shop in a small one-story
building that stood a little north of
the old -First Church or, to be more
exact, on the large lot now occupied
by the McCullough mausoleum.
In the old days the building had
been used at different times as a drug
store, grocery, ofllce and the like.
Mr. Cloude, who was a middle-aged
man, came to nennlngtcn early in the
fall of 178S nnd at once began ' the
business of hair dresser, barber and
wig-maker. It was his custom to visit
his customers at their homes to do
work, especially for women. It is
said i that Gov. Tit-honor1, Gov, Moses
Robinson, Anthony. Haswell and other
notables of . the. time were amoug-Mr.
Coudn's- customers. Mr. Coude, how
ever, did not find the business remun
erative and he returned to Albany in
ITl'l,
I am quite sure Mr. Coude was suc
ceeded in 1802 by John Alexander,' al-1
so: of 'Albany. - His shop was located !
noar the site of the Bennington battle
monument. He. followed the I barber
ing business for many years and diod
In 183(1 at. the , advanced age of 93
years.

to within a lew days of his death, he
gradually failed until ho passed away.
It was in the late 70's that Mr,
Hilllard and his brother purchased
the Augustus Armstrong farm and
came to Dorset to reside. They were
a welcome addition to the social
circles of Dorset and since that time
the family of J. F. Hilllard has been
more or less identified with the life
of the town for although not residents
for the past twelve years their fre
ipieut visits have kept them in close
communication with Dorset affairs,
. Mr. Hilllard, was a" good 'citizen,' T'he
