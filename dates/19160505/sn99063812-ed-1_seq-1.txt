ERUN, May 5, That Germany hat yielded practically every demand
America made In her recent note regarding eubmarlne activities It Indi
cated In the text of the German reply published here today.
The concessions, hewever, are made conditional upon the success of
the efforts of the United State. America Is urged to force England to ob
ttrvt fully the principals of International law.
The note fully concedes Presldet Wilson's contention that hereafter!
no merchantmen, whether freighters or passenger liners, are to be sunk with-'
cut warning, unless they reelst capture or attempt to escape. The German
submarine commanders havo already received new orders meeting these de
mands. The government expresses Implicit confidence that these orders
will be executed In good faith.
The feeling here is that the possibility of a break with America has
been avoided.
In the first part of the text, tho language Is caustic. Germany refuses
te believe the American contention of the Sussex torpedoing, holding that'
"America refused to substantiate her assertion by reference to concrete

In discussing the submarine campaign, the German note inaists that the
'temmanders of submarines have been ordered to use their vessels with a
centlderatlon for the Interests of neutrals. England, It Is charged, by viola
tiens of international law, forced Germany to "resort to the hard, but never
sheltss effective weapon of submarine warfare.
The note relteratee Germany' deelre to maintain good relations with
'America. To this It adds a statement that Germany expects America to "de
mind and Insist that England shall forthwith observe fully the rules of
International law as Universally recognised before the war."
"Should the steps America takes not attain the object desired," continues
the nets, "Germany would than be facing a new situation, wherein It must
reserve to Itself the complete liberty of decision."
It Is stated that -Oarman naval forces have been ordered not to olnk

within and without the areaa declared to be naval war tones.
