Enoch a. Bryan, retired president
of the state College, received the
unanimous endorsement of the 200
delegates to the county republican
convention at Colfax last Saturday
for United States senator. The reso
lution of endorsement was presented
by R. M. Burgunder of Colfax and
passed without a dissenting vote. Dr.
Bryan was also honored by election
to the chairmanship of the conven

hall was held Tuesday evening with
all city fathers in attendance except
I Councilman',Scott. A large num

anticipation of action on the pro
posed viaduct, but these wore in a
large measure disappointed. A num
ber of property owners in Reaney's
! First addition were on hand to pro
test against the lopping off of from
four to eight feet of their property
by the recent survey of that part of
town. Inasmuch as the old, but
incorrect, survey had been recog
nized as correct for nearly 15 years,
it is probable that relief will be af

Resolutions adopted by the con
vention condemned as dangerous to
the republic- the "shifting and shuf

cratic administration, favored such
preparation for national defense as
would enable our army and navy to
cope with any foreign foe, and
rapped the democratic tariff policy
and the administration of Governor
Lister. The resolutions mentioned in
a laudatory manner the work of the
republican legislative delegation
from this county and called attention
to the saving of $67,000 a year to
the county in state- taxes through the
work of the- republican legislature.
The convention went on record as
favorable to the efforts of the Whit

the county nominees to strict econ

AUTOMOBILE DRIVERS
MUST OBEY LAWS
Mayor Jackson Issues Orders to
Arrest Every Man Who tails
to Heed City and Stale Auto
mobile Laws
All owners or drivers of automo
biles must hereafter obey the city
and state automobile traffic- laws or
suffer dire calamity, according to
an ultimatum issued by Mayor Hur
ley Jackson before the city council
Tuesday evening, after several of the
city fathers had reported failure on
the part of the big majority of driv
ers to heed the laws laid down by
Hl*fUuncil in ordinance- form. Re
ports of "tiii-inile" speeders in the
residence district, the indiscriminate
parking of autos and numerous and
divers other complaints were poured
Into the- ears of the chief city official
by councilmen and citizens, and his
official edict was delivered in a man
ner that indicated that he means
business. Mayor Jackson scouted
the theory that many of the law vio
lations are occasioned by the fact
that the- drivers are not acquainted
with the general traffic laws, and
stated that he has made observations
which prove to him that this is not
tin; case. He cited instances where
Pullman automobile drivers, who
violate the spirit and the letter of
the traffic laws in Pullman every
day, "glide down Riverside avenue
in Spokane, where observance of the
laws is compulsory, and show just
as keen a comprehension of the re
quirements of the law as the best
informed Spokane driver."
Mayor Jackson stated that extra
men will be placid on police duty if
necessary to enforce- the laws and
that every violator will be punished.
The council engaged in a general
discussion of plans for a new auto
mobile ordinance, which will soon be
drafted, the problem of restricting
the parking of automobiles to cer
tain streets or to certain parts of the
streets, proving a knotty one. Nu
merous suggestions, including the
parking of the automobiles in the
center of the streets, with driveway
openings on either side, and backing
the machines into the curb, were
made, but none were adopted.
A councllmanic committee consist
ing of Swain, Duthie- and Nye was
appointed to confer with the auto
mobile association, recently organ
ized, in working out plans for a new
ordinance.
it is probable that a number or
the suggestions made by the •'ham
ber of Commerce committee and pub
lished in last week's Herald, will he
incorporated in the new measure.
CEMETERY" CLEAN-UP TODAY
Today's clean-up program consists
of a general improvement of the
various cemeteries. All owners of
lots are urged to make needed im
provements and the cemetery asso
ciation will have charge of the gen
eral clean-up. The last two days of
the week the city will have teams
and wagons to gather up all the rub
bish that is left In the alleys of pri-
Ivate residences.

Crossings
The proposal to connect the two
parts of Main street with a viaduct
Instead of paving Spring street from
the concrete bridge east to the city
limits, as proposed by the council,
was given a decided boost Tuesday
evening, when a representative of
the Northern Pacific Railway com

er, with a written protest against.
the paving and a boost for the pio-
P< sed viaduct The reasons for oh

the communication as follows:
Thai the portion of said street or
highway proposed to he improved
crosses over the right-of-way and
tiacks of ib- company and also of
the 0.-W. R. & X. Co.; that said
street forms .1 part of the so-calteJ
Inland Empire highway, carrying a
large amount of state and interstate
traffic, and is also the main high
way for loctl traffic coining ii.ro the
"iv of Pullman from the farming
d 'trie! on i lie- east rut southeast;
mid that Bald highway, If Improve
i.s above sta'od will carry iv in
creased volume of traffic, particu
larly automobile traffic, and said
crossings over the railroad tracks
will become exceedingly dangerous,
and the probability of serious acci
dent greatly increased. That said
Improvement will not benefit said
right-of-way.
"Therefore, said N. P. Railway
company respectfully requests that
said improvement be not ordered by
said city, and that In lieu thereof
arrangements be made to improve
Main street and an extension thereof
crossing over said railroad tracks
and rights-of-way by means of a
bridge or viaduct, thereby eliminat
ing the dangerous grade closings."
The company's representative, in
explanation of the protest, stated
that the public service commission is
taking steps to eliminate dangerous
grade crossings in all parts of the
state, and that the company would
rather see the viaduct constructed
now than to pave the street and
later have it condemned by the com
mission. lie stated that the protest.
was filed only to delay the proposed
paving until such time as the rail
road companies, the city of Pullman
ami the public service commission
could get together on some method
of eliminating the several crossings,
or as many of them as possible.
The 0.-W. R. & N. company, also
represented by an oficlal, protested
against the paving without qualifi
cation, stating that the hard surface
pavement to a width of 30 feet is
unnecessary for the protection of
present or future traffic and there
fore extravagant.
The hearing on the resolution con
cerning the paving was continued
until May 10.
