QUESTION LONG IN ISSUE.
Controversy Over Submarine Policy
Embarrassing From First.
Washington, May 5, Germany's
diplomatic correspondence with the
United States on. the submarine Issue
has extended over nearly a year and
more than once has brought the two
countries to the verge of a break.
All along President Wilson has
spoken for the inviolable rights of
Americans and- generally "fSr tlffc rights
of neutrals. Germany has insisted it
should not curtail the effectiveness of
her best enemy against her weapons
ai.d President Wilson has been em
barrassed by the difference of opinion
In the cabinet, then in congress and
also by* the pro-German propaganda
thruout the oountry.
Submarine warfare entered the
realm of diplomacy with the destruc
tion of the Lusltanla. The first note to
Germany was dispatched May 15, 1915.
It characterized the attacks on the
Falaba, Cushlng, Gulfllght and Lusl
-tanla, as a "series of events Which the
United State* has observed with grow
ing, concern, distress and amazement."
-German Reply Unsatisfactory.

Germany replied In a note held to'

that the Itusltanla had masked gone
aboard that she in effect was a
British auxiliary cruiser, that she
carried munitions of war, that her
owning company, aware of the dam
ages she risked In the submarine war
zone, was In reality responsible for the
loss of American lives. The note met
none of the contentions of the United
States so far as the Iusitanla and
Falaba sinkings were concerned, altho
a supplementary note later did ac

In the attacks on the Cushlng and
Gulfllght, expressed regret for these
two cases and promised to fay dam

While the American reply to the
note was being framed, dissension in
the cabinet resulted "liT the resignation
of Secretary Bryan. He designed be
cause he thought he could not sign the
next note to Germany, which he
feared would lead (he United States
into war.
Dr. Dumba, the Austrian ambas
sador. later recalled at. the request of
President Wilson, sent to the Berlin
office a message which was reprer
sented as stating substantially that
Mr. Bryan had. intimated to the am
bassador that the vigorous tone of the
American note phould not be regarded
In Berlin as top warlike.
Lanainig Takea leaue.
Secretary Lansing, Mr. Bryan's suc
cessor, in hie reply to the German not*
took issue with weyy contention Ger
many had set up in the Falaba and
Liusitanla cases, dehiftd flatly .the con
tention that the liusltania was armed,
and reminded Germany that it was the
duty of the United States "to speak
with'solemn empluupU to call t&e at
tention of the iippe^tal German govern
ment to the grave responsibility the
United States conceives It has incurred
in this tragio ocoyrrence and the in
disputable piinteiplea upon which that
responsibility teatf."

The negotiations at this time were
brought Into the realm of "informal'
conversations" between Secretary Laiy
sing and Count von Bemstorff. It was
thought much could be accomplished
by personal contact whllht was lost in
a cold exchange of documents.
Meanwhile the Arabic was sunk on
Aug. 19 and it seemed that the United
States and Germany had reached the
point of a break. Then on Sept. 1 came
a rift in the threatening situation.
Count von Bernstorff presented this
written assurance:
"Lilners will not be sunk by our sub
marines without warning and wlthSIit
safety of non-combatants, provided
that the liners do not try to escape or
offer resistance."
The United States had all along con
tended not for the safety of "liners"
alone but for the immunity of all
peaceful merchant vessels. The word
"liners" was the complexlng point !n
Germany's assurances and a complete
agreement on what It actually meant
waa never reached.
More Hopeful Outlook.
Mpre hopeful became the outlook'
when Germany disavowed the sinking
of the Arabic and declared~3rrtbm*rine
commanders bad been given washing
not to sink merchant vesselB.
Negotiations were delayed 'by a
seeming deadlock ovpr the words In
which Germany should acknowledge
the legality of the destruction of the
Lusitanla. Germany made the dec

directed at others than enemy sub
jects.", ...

The submarine warfare was
declared to be "manifestly indefens

The German retaliation against the
British blockade it malnt^ned must not

which the note declared was based on

promise. The American note con
cluded:
"Friendship Itself prompts It (the
United States government) to say to
the imperial German government that

Finally the accumulation of evidence
reached such proportions with the de
struction of th* Sussex"that President
Wilson dtepattffced another note to
Germany, apd went before congress to
review ithe entire'situation, and made
this declaration:
"I have deemed It my duty to say to
the imperial German government that

relentless an& )hdlscrlmlnate warfare,

Is at last forces to the conclusion that
there is but one course to pursue and
that, unless the imperial German gov
ernment should now, Immediately, de
clare and effect an abandonment of its
present methods of warfare against
passenger and freight carrying vessels,
this government can now have no
choice but to sever diplomatic relations
altogether."
President Inoludes All 8hips.
It will be noted that the president
went further than "liners" and said
"passenger and freight carrying ves
sels."
Reviewing the relentless submarine
campaign, the last note declared:
"No limit has in fact been set to the
indiscriminate pursuit and destruction
of merchantmen of all kinds and na
tionalities Within the waters, constant
ly extending, where these operations
have been carried on, and the roll of
Americans who have lost their, lives
on ships thus destroyed, has grown
month by month until the ominous toll
has mounted Into,the hundreds.
"Again and again the Imperial Ger
man. government has given this gov
ernment its Solemn assurances that at
least passenger ships would not be
thus dealth with and thus It has again
and again permitted its undersea com
manders to disregard those assurances
with Impunity."
The presidettf dispatched the note on
April

and addressed congress the
following day.

New York, May 5.—Count von Bern

ceived the note by telegraph from the
Sayvllle wireless station at the Ritz
Carlton hotel. He refused to discuss It.
Count von Bernstorff left for Wash
ington today on a 1 o'clock train.
It is known, however, that the Ger
man embassy view is that the note'is
all for which the United States asked
that it signalizes a return, to what has
been termed "Bruiser warfare"—that is
the operation of submarines as crullers.
Intercepting commerce with wialt and

The embassy view ts that inasmuch

of the question, of armament it is not

plled the following comment of Ameri
can newspapers on the German note:
Baltimore News: The United*fttates
demanded the establishment of a cer
tain status quo. Germany haa estab
lished It How long she can or win
maintain it is another question, but for
the time being we are left nothing to
complain of.
Des Moines Capital: A careful read
ing of the note, will disclose nothing
new. It is written In rather an un
friendly and In a wholly critical
spirit. The note is an offense against
the Intelligence and dignity of the
United States.
Pittsburgh Chronlcle-Telegtapli: So
far as words go Germany has granted
oi.r main contention, but if her aotion
is only temporary and depends on the
future course of Great Britain the sit
uation is one fraught with grave peril
to our friendly relations.
Louisville Times: The unofficial
text of the German note serves notloe
that the United States must force
England to end her blockade of food
stuffs.
Providence Bulletin: It le a brutal
mockery of the wounds again and
araln Inflicted upon us. It is a series
of studied Insults added to a long in
ventory of Injuries. The president
must prove that the tofty sentiments
he has often reiterated are not empty
words.
Cleveland Waechter and Anzelger:
The German answer Is that of the
strong, whose conscience Is clear, Who
wishes peace without fearing war. It
puts the flnal say up to Mr. Wilson
ar.d places before him the chance
who

New York Globe: The reply Is not
to be accepted as t. settlement of the

compliance. No choice would this
seem to open to our government but
to carry out its first declared Intention
