New Spring Suits $10. to $25.
NQW$8.50to$16-75
JUST the SALE YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!
At this time of the year every one gets impatient for "something new
to wear' 'so this sale of suits will no doubt be welcomed most heartily.
Every suit has some new and distinctive feature about it that stamps
it as absolutely of this spring fashioning. Each one is most desirable and
wearable. Even the least expensive is well tailored, daintily lined, and not
skimped in material. Those at the higher prices are marvels of good weaves,
'. smart style and color.
Many of them are Bischof suits, which we have just received from that
. famous designer. Women like Bischof suits and wait for word about them
'rJ-'they're always beautifully tailored, smart though simple, and surprisingly
inexpensive.
Come in early tomorrow. Remember, these are very special prices to
start spring buying in earnest.

are said to be not necessarily fa
tal. Our W. A. Carson informs
us that his brother, Gus Carson,
who we reported had died sudden
ly last Sunday morning a week
ago, was shot to death, the assas
sin uing a double barrell gun
loaded with buck-shot. After
killing Mr. Carson, the assassin
carefully placed the gun across the
breast of the dead man presuma
bly to bear out the idea of suicide.
Mr. Carson was a large owner of
valuable mining stock, and doubt
lessly was killed for this reason,
as there had recently been con
siderable advance in the stock.
We hope to learn more of this un
fortunate affair, and that the New
Mexico authorities will succeed in
unraveling what now seems to be
a mystery. It is said that Mr.
Carson had no enemies that he
knew of. MissAngie Hunt was
the guest of her sister, Mrs. W.
H. Anderson, last week.
Miss mae Cummins was visit
ing friends in Mt Vernon Satur
day and Sunday. From the num
ber that boarded the train Sunday
noon from this place, Brodhead

Sunday on account of the Fifth

My dear friend:-
Tne article which appeared in
the Signal a short time- ago rela
tive to a raid on a cabaret, con
ducted by Inspector Dwyer, was
read by -ire with much interest
and I am very thankful to vou
and the editor my old friend,
Edgar Albright for publishing
same. I read the "Signal" every
week with interest and am kept
informed of all the news about all
my old friends and relatives in
old Rockcaste county. I note
with interest that ou are going
to have the Boone Way construct
ed through Mt. Vernon which wit
not only bean improvement to the
land value but to those of our peo
ple who wish to use this highway
for motoring or driv'ng for pleas-
ure,- ousmess or commercial pur
poses.
You will find enclosed in a sep
arate package which I am sending
an account of the Police work
conducted by our office in that
portion of the City of New York
knewn as Chinatown. This artic
le appeared in the Sunday Trib-
umn an account of the discovery
of a "Chinese Arsenal" but the
young fellow who wrote this story
is a little off as these implements
of war used in the Chinese fueds
are nothing"more than relics of
by gone days when the Hip Sings
Tongs were at.war with the On
Leon Tongs. There is no antici
pation of another Tong war for as
we have suppressed gambling and
driven the gamblers to other cities
the other undesirable element
have gone with them.
The Chinese ar- very interest
ing and it is hard to understand
them, but by persistence and per
severance we beat them at their
own game, and thsy finaUs gave
up for the farst time in the history
of Chinatown. When the Chinese
used to fi?ht they always used re
volvers of large calibre is colts
or Smith & Wesson. If a police
officer was to show them the reg
ulation police revolver which is a
38 Police Positive Colt, they
would remark: "He be too lung"
(young). When a Chinaman fires
a revolver at another, he as a rule,
shuts his eyes and turns his head
the other way. There is a fellow
here by the name of Louie Way
one of the old Chinese gun-men
who was hired to go around to
Mott street to shoot one of the
head men in the On Leon Tongs
by the name of Gee To y. He
went around with his big 4s Colts
and seeing Gee Toy "He takum
big boy out and shutum eyes and
he hit horse in Naughtin's stable
one block away "
Gee Toy, the bad man, of the
On Leon Tongs, who used to wear
a vest made 01 cnains ana go
around to Pell Street with two
big boys iu his hands (2 45 Smith
& Wesson) and make the Hip
Sings hop "He empt two b:e
boys, he throw them in street, he
pull out two more and make Hip
Sings hop some mure." Gee Toy
is a peaceful individual and my
best friend at the present time,
and I do not think there will ever
be another Tong war.
At the present time in this city,
there is much talk as well as ac
tion, along the line of .prepared
ness and Police Department of
the City of New York, are doing
their share along these lines. We
are now getting ready several reg
iments to go into camp atj Fort
Wadsworth, Staten Island, which
is one of the United States Gov
ernment forts Each policeman
will go into camp for two weeks
and be taught how to drill, shoot
both with smal arms and cannons.
I do not helieve that we will have
a war but the best way to have
peace is to have a big enough
army aud navy to make all na
tions afraid of us and they will
leave us alone and also respect us
more than they are at the pres ent
time.
If you are ever up to New York
I will make it a point to see -that
you get keys to the city. I "will
do my best to make things inter
esting for you. Please give my
regards to all of my old friends
and extend to them an invitation
to my home should any of them
journey this way any time in the
future.
Your true friend,
William O Jones.
