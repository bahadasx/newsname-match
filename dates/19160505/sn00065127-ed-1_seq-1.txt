Hon. Charles A. Christopherson,
the Sioux Falls candidate for congress
In this district, offers his services on
the broad basis of humau needs and
the betterment of humanity. Of such
is his pledge to work for au interna
tional agreement fir ak court of
abitratlon for the settlement of all
disputes between nations. In such a
proposal rests the hope of the world
for a continuation of the civilization
of the past, and for its future growth.
The farmers of this district should
vote for Mr. Chrlstopheraon on ac
count of his stand ou rural credits.
He stands for a rural credit law such
as has proved so valuable in European
countries, and without the red tape
and host of salaried officials provided
for in the present bill now before
congress. Mr. Chrlstopheraon agrees
with The Forum that if the farmers
of a district take the responsibility
for each loan made to their number,
there is no necessity of having two or
mure federal inspectors come a long
distance to inspect the laud. Abroad
the members of the local organization
are responsible for each loan made to
a member, therefore there are no loss
es. The same rule would hold good
'In this country, and the present
attempt of congress to hoist another
host of salaried officials on the tax
payers, or the men who will become

members and borrowers of the rural
credit banks should be knocked in the
bead. It Is a perversion ol the very
idea of a rural credit bank or banking
law.
Mr. Chrlstoplierson Is right on every
republican policy, and his attitude on
the two points given above, which
are and will be most prominently
before congress during the next two
years, should ensure his election.
To farmers especially, we appeal for
support, as a sane rural credits law
means much to this
state and district.

Two Wonderlul American
Achievements
The electrification of 440 miles of
the main line of the Chicago, Milwau
kee & St. Paul Railway, between
Harlowton, Mont., and Avery, Idaho,
across the Great Continental Divide,
and the digging of the Panama Canal,
stand linked as the greatest engineer
ing achievements of this generation.
The Canal ushers in a new era In
ocean travel—the "Milwaukee" elec
trification heralds a new era in trans
continental railroading, mastering for
ever the stupendous obstacles of the
mountains, carrying traffic over the
massive barriers with ease and with a
pronounced saving in cost decidedly
improving train operatlou. practically
eliminating all trouble from cold and
snow making mountain travel clean
and mountain vistas clear, and by pro
ducing power from mountain water
falls instead of from coal, taking a
definite step to conserve the world's
resources. The "Milwaukee" is ever to
the fore in increasing travel comforts
and pleasures. The accomplishment
of the first extensive main line elec
tricfication in the world Isbut another
item in the long list of Its pioneering
achievements.
On your next trip to the Pacific
North Coast, take the "Olympian" or
"Columbian" and enjoy the travel su

A Neglected Lawn Shows It
One of the worst lawn weeds with
which we have to contend is the
dandelion. This also is a pest of old
lawns that are kept mowed too close
so that the roots never get strong. If
the lawns are not tramped too much
and the grass is allowed to get long
in the fall, it will do much to keep out
the dandelion. If the lawn is not
tramped and not cut for about two
years, experience shows that blue
grass will crowd out the dandelion,
but tills method probably will not be
popular as the neighbors will make
unkind remarks about the looks of
your lawn. At any rate, be willing
to pay the youngsters for hand weed
ing the lawn the first two or three
year's they will want some spending
money. So don't be a tight wad.
In dry seasons the blue grass will
look pretty dingy in midsummer un
less you can sprinkle. Be careful In
dry seasons and not keep It cut too
short. The dandelion is sure to get
in then. Cutting short also weakens
the roots yery much. Especially
should you let the grass get long in
the fall so ^s to give strength to the
roots. Avoid watering the lawn when
in full sunlight The Ideal grass for
driest seasons is still to come as far
as I know.—Prof. N. E. Hansen, State
College.

Miscellaneous Showers.
Last Friday evening Misses Kllcn
Stetten and Carrie Hanson pleasantly
spent the forepart of the evening at
the home of Imllda Larson. After
supper they decided to spend a few
moments at the Movies and on their
way to the show stopped in to get
Miss Sletteu's sister, Mary, when to
Ellen's surprise she found the mem
bers of the Phllathea Sundayschool
class at her home and,anxiously wait
ing for her. The evening was
pleasantly spent in doing fancy work
and in writing recipes and things a
bride should know.
Before dainty refreshments were
served, came the search for gifts and
many and beautiful were these tokens
of remem be ranees, which included
such articles as towels, china, bedding,
aluminum wear, kitchen utensils, etc
Last Monday evening Miss Winfred
Hannah gave a very enjoyable shower
for Mis Ellen Sletten, a bride of next
week. The rooms were beautifully
decorated with cut flowers and fern
leaves and the bride's colors of pink
and white. Many and varied were
the games and stunts provided for
the entertainment of invited guests
who were: Emma Thorson, Elsie
liunt, Mary Anderson, Belle Tober
son, Marie Engen, Molly Johnson,
Minnie Twedt and Carrie Hanson.
At an interval between games some
one rang the door bell and left a good
size May basket for Miss Sletten and
upon opening it she found it contain
ed articles of fancy work, china and
silver from her friends. A most
delightful luncheon was then served
and perhaps the most Interesting
feature of it was a nicely decorated
angel food cake, which contained the
proverbial ring, coin and thimble.
Miss Sletten, being the lucky one
to And the ring and Mary Anderson
the coin. After lunch there was
another May basket left at the door,
for the bride-to-be and this one diifer
ed from the other one by containing
cake tins, muffin pans, etc each one
with a tried and true recipe attached.
At a late hour the guests departed,
satisfied with an evening well spent.
The Methodist Sunday School of
Canton has been having some very
interesting times the pad* few months
ou account of the division of men and
boys and women and girls being near
ly equal. The men and boys have
numbered almost as many as women
and girls but never as many until last
Sunday, when they outnumbered
them by two. The attendance last
Sunday was 262. The division being
women and girls 130, men and boys
132. With the new Superintendant
came some ne ideas, he has instituted
a contest to be pulled off on May 14th.
It the men and boys outnumber the
women and girls, the women and girls
must serve a picnic dinner to the
entire school and if the women and
girls outnumber the men and boys,
the men and boys must serve the
dinner. On account of the contest
the attendance will be announced
each week in the city papers. We
hope that every member of the Sun
day school will be in attendance on
May 14th and every one that is not
attending Sunday school elsewhere is
cordially invited. There will be some
special music by the school on the day
of the contest. Each side is determined
to win and there is considerable
enthusiasm. The largest class last
Sunday was the Men's Bible class, 32
in number.
Monday, May 1st, saw the opening
of the fishing season in this state and
it was an ideal day for the sport. Tlie
boys have been catching large strings
of carp, suckers, bullheads, red horse,
buffalo and catfish for a week past and
now they are at liberty to catch
perch, pike, croppies, sunttsh and rock
bass but the ban will not be lifted
from the large and small mouth bass
until May 30. Many people have been
brought Int) court this spring for
violation of the state laws regarding
fishing anS a word of warning might
not be out of place. According to the
South Dakota laws no. person shall
use nets, seines or other traps in
catching fish, or catch Ush except by
means of a line attached to a pole and
held in the hand. No person shall use
more than two poles at one time and
no person shall attach more than
three hooks to each line. Fishing
within 400 feet on either side of a
dam is unlawful. |t is also in direct
violation of the laws of this state to
sell or offer for sale game ttsh caught
within the state.
