Vocational Sckool for Cresco.
Along with the fact that we have in
Cresco a Farmers' Institute, The
Farmers' Protective Association, and
other Farmers' Clubs in and about
Cresco, Mr. C. D. Nichols informs us
that the Commercial Club of Chicago
are willing to assist in establishing a
Vocational School here at Cresco, and
with a little interest shown from any
of these sources they are willing to
send Prof. Edwin G. Cooley here to
explain the object of these schools and
their advantages, and he will also spend
a few days here talking to the farmers
and the farmers' sons and daughters
who are interested. This would cer
tainly be a great treat to some, as
Prof. Cooley is not a stranger in Cresco,
and it would be a great advantage to
others. Prof. Cooley has recently re
turned from Europe where he has spent
five years in the study of this subject
in Germany, Prussia and Denmark.
With his knowledge of these schools
and knowing the great good that they
have done in European countries, this
is an opportunity that this community
should not overlook.
