I BUILD THIS CITY UPRIGHT I
BY THE EDITOR
v I should like to propose today to the Commercial
club a new activity— a building and housing survey
of Tacoma.
In the past, the building of this city has progress
ed in a highly spasmodic way. Sometimes the town
has been over-built, sometimes under built; some
limes built wisely and in an orderly manner, some
times wastefudly and foolishly.
Every indication is that now Tacoma, after sev
eral years of construction inactivity, is about to en
ter on a period of building. It is important that this
be done with foresight and efficiency.
The Commercial club, it seems to me, is the best
 agency available for handling Ibis question in a big,
masterful way.
What I suggest is that a live-wire committee he
named. First, it should undertake to obtain a com
prehensive idea of what Tacoma'■ present building
and housing conditions are.
It should list all buildings that are fire-traps or
that for any other reason ought to be razed. If I
building warrants condemnation, the committee
ought to see that it is condemned.
. It ought to bring pressure to bear on non resident
property-owners to induce them to tear down worth
less and to repair dilapidated structures, and work
in a diplomatic and neighborly way with resident
landlords to the same end.
It should determine whether there is an over-sup
ply or an under-supply of the various types of build
ings. If there is a greater supply of, let us say,
lodging house structures than there is of good ten
ants for such buildings, it would be to the advantage
of prospective investors to know it. If there is a

Whether you believe In this

You will want to decide it intel

Non-partisanship is becoming

would be | valuable advisory hoard when these public buildings are contem
plated.
Tacoma is marred now by almost nothing that resembles a tenement There
is no reason why it ever should have tenements, and if there was a committee
such as this on the alert there never would be tenements. Furthermore by co
operating with the health authorities and by a continued educational campaign
such a committee could help raise the general standard of housing conditions\o
that Tacoma s present remarkable death rate might be kept down and probably
forced even lower. *
Its study of building conditions naturally would lead also Into a considera
tion of platting and street improvements, and there, too, valuable service could
be performed.
It lias been a familiar spectacle iiioiir.'itv hall, when some street improve
ment is proposed, for opposing groups of specially interested property owners
to appear and fight bitterly for and a-ainst the contemplated expenditure.
Both groups look at the question from their selfish standpoints, whirl, is natur
al and proper enough, but the general public, which also has an interest in the
matter, has no voice. Such a committee, if actuated by wisdom and justice
could serve with great value as an impartial party in such disputes
in short, such a committee could discourage foolish and wasteful construc
tion, stimulate the sort of building that will be of the most value, co-ordinate
ihe work ot public boards and officials and do a groat dial toward giving this
city a well-planned and finished dress.
Such a committee would fa.-c an immense task. Membership would be no
sol snap. Kventua ly. the work miglltgTOW to,, grea. for the ,lub 1., t-arrv ,,
and it seem advisable to turn the undertaking over to a municipal hoard How

wiieless to Saytille.)—ln Its
reply (o the American note,
Germany hit* yielded prac
tically every demand con
cerning submarine warfare.
Kvery possibility of a
break apparently has been
avoided.
Germany makes a com
plete backdown conditional
upon America's forcing Kng
l.iu.l lo t.liv.ivr fully the
principles uf International
law.
The reply fully concedes Presi
dent Wilson's contention that no
merchantman, whether freight
or passenger vessel, shall be tor
pedoed without warning unless
It resists or attempts to escape.
Submarine commanders have
received new orders meeting the
demands.
Germany expresses implicit
confidence that these orders will
be exc-outed In -good faith.
Doesn't Admit Wrong.
The note docs not concede that
a submarine torpedoed the Sus
sex. It says Germany is inves
tigating the case further.
It states that "the German gov
ernment thinks it of little avail
to enter into (he details at the
praaent stage ol affairs, particu
