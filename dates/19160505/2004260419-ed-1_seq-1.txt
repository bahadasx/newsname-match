RECALL CANDIDATES
ARE NOMINATED
NQN PARTISAN TICKET
It. H. llatUn, Norman Merrill aud
Henry Itudillnwn Noiiilnatetl
rerauant to call a mass meeting
was held In the City Hall Tuesday
afternoon for the purpose of uoml
natlng candldutes for County Judge
and two Commissioners on the re
call ticket. The meeting was called
to order by W. J. Fullerton. On
call for nominations for permanent
chairman, Martin White placed the
name of W. J. Fullerton In nomlua
Hon and ho was elected permanent
chulrman
Mr. Fullerton stated the object of
the meeting aud dwelt to some length
as to the necessity for the recall
He said a majority of the Taxpayers
Leuicue were opposed to the retail
but Inasmuch aa the legislature had
extended the term of County Judge
from four to six years, and aa the
tax burden coutlnuns to Increase, and
the wishes of the people continually
Ignored by the prosent court, thev
knew of no alternative but to Invoke
tlia recall.
I . I . Cassett waa elected perma
nent secretary.
In anticipation of balloting, the
chair appointed M. F. Itaxen and
Uus. Ijing tellers.
Nominations being declared In or
der, ft. 8. llattan waa placer In
nomination for County Judge. Mar
tin White moved that the nomina
tions bo closed aud tho secretary
authorized to cast the unnanlmoua
vote of the convention for Mr. Hut-
tan.
Mr. Hattan took the floor and
stated that ho would only accept the
nomination under ceutaiu conditions
and u nl e the recall candidates had
the full aupporl of the whole coun
ty, they would all be defeated. This
brought forth conclderable talk when
Mr. Whtto placed the nominations
of Norman Morrill of Clatakunie and
llonry Ituddlman of Mist, for Coun
ty CoiumlHslonura. Matters were
getting somewhat tangled when M.
K. Miller moved that a recess of
fifteen minutes be taken for a con
ference and tho motion prevailed.
Meeting called to order after re
cess.
Mr. Whito moved that the name
of A. II. Tarbell be substituted for
Henry Ituddlman. This brought Mr.
Tarboll to his foot aud ho positively
refused to be a candidate against
Judson Weed, and intimated that he
might withdraw from the campaign
altogothur.
Mr. Merrill, In a few brief remarks,
declined to accept tho nomination
on the ground that It would not be
good policy.
C. J. Larson took the floor and
counclled a union of strength and
atated that he was largely Instru
mental In bringing out Mr. Tarbell
aa candidate for Commissioner, and
while he OBleemcd him just as high
ly, he would now support Mr. Mer
rill.
At this Juncture Mr. Tarbell with
drew from the field as a candidate
for commissioner.
Under this shift of a strong candi
date from the south part of the
county, Mr. Morrill announced that
he would accept the nomination.
This brought forth considerable ap-plauso.
The question ot authorizing the
secretary to cast the unanimous vote
of tho convention for these nominees
being stll In tho air, the question
was called and the secretary cast
tho unanimous vote of the convention.
The convention then adjourned.

A FRIENDLY CALL
Judge Moreland made this office
frbandly call Saturday. Judge
Moroland Is an old-time acquaint
ance of tho writer and we wore glad
to have him romember us. In an
early day he was of great assistance
to the Masonic lodge of this city and
when over help was needed, all that
was necesary was to send him word.
Many a time ho rode down on horse
back through mud and rain to lend
a fraternal hand. Chief Justice
Moore, James Muckle, Judge Mc
Urlde ond Judgo Dart wore old-time
cronies and a friendship waa formed
in those early days that only denth
will aovor.
M. R. Tomroy, deputy fish warden,
accompanied by Alex Karlnen of As
toria, deputy U. S. collector and In
spector, were hero tho early part of
last weok looking out for violations
of tho fishing law and also Inspect
ing the equipment of the various
fishing boats to see If they bud the
proper amount required by la. Mr.
Karlnen states that, while he found
several boats not fully equipped, tho
majority of them were In flrst-clusK
Bhape and evidently were trying to
comply with the provisions of the
law.

All danger of a fishermen's strike
on the Columbia during the season
was averted by tho action of the
Fishermen's Protective Union when
tho members voted to accept the
packer's price, but reserve the r'ght
to sell small fish to tho highest bid
der. Tho price agreed UDon was
64 cents a pound for small fish
and 7V4 cents per pound for largo
salmon.
From the way the game started
out, none of us expected such a sad
finish, and as we slowly wended our
way from the park after the last
man waa out in the ninth, we could
not help but think that It "Red"
Lund hadn't exploded in the fatal
sixth and it Armsprlger had thought
to put a little glue In his glove, that '
the finish might have been a. little
different really, we would have had
a chance to slip it over on the Brad
fords. Manager Ballagh shifted both
Infield and outtield In an endeavor
to make it different, and from the
way the game started, we thought
we would have a chance to expand
our lungs right along. When the
fatal sixth came and big Red Lund
blew up with a crash that reminded
one of the destruction of one of
Kaiser Bill's zeppelins, we knew the
whole thing was over. Lund pitched
good ball for five Innings although
two scores were registered against
him, one in the second and one in
the fifth. Both were due to passed
balls. In the meantime the White
Sox had been retiring either by tho
strike-out route or else dropping the
ball into the hands of some waiting
Bradford. But when the sixth came,
wo lost hope, for the fire works
started and tour large runs were
hung up and when Lund struck out
Moreland for the third out it seemed
that this dizzy inning waa over, but
Armsprlger dropped the ball and
when ho threw the ball to first to
catch the atruck-out runner, Lund
threw his glove into the air, string
ing the ball and allowing Moreland
to reach first In safety and Luckey
scoring. Moreland scored on hits,
wild pitches, etc., etc. In tho seventh
after all was gone but the last line
of trenches, Ballagh called for re
inforcements and sent the pick pt the
Highlanders, Donaldson, to stave oft
the threatened (?) defeat. Alex per
formed well, but there was no mote
chance of heading off the Bradfords
than there was of Townshend's es
caping the Turkish army. The box
