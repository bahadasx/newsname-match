Frequent Poor Connections of Inter
urban With Iron Mountain at De
Lassus Cause Much Complaint
The Times has heard considerable,
complaint recently regarding the fre-1
quent poor connections made by the
interurban railway with incoming
trains at DeLassus, causing passen- i
gers arriving there on their way to!
this city indefinite waits, and often j
causing them much trouble and great
inconvenience. We did not fully ap-1
preciate the merits ia such ccmp.amts
until last Sunday, when The Times
editor arrived at that point and found
no car in waiting to bring passengers
to this city. Having no chaffeur in j
waiting for us in fact not even pos
sessing an auto we were compelled
to await, with several others, the com
ing of the car, which made its ap
pearance in about an hour, permitting
several dinners to grow cold and
stale.
But this question of delayed car ser
vice, especially at the DeLassus end
of the line, is not only a hardship to
passengers to this place, but it works
a very great injustice to Farmington.
The Iron Mountain train was not more
than fifteen minutes late Sunday, and
vet all passengers to this place were
compelled to wait one hour for car,
the one having brought passengers to

FATAL AUTO ACCIDENT
. . I
Mrs. W. M. Acuff of Ste. Genevieve Killed
and Mr. Acuff's Leg Broken in Ac-
cident Near Farmington
A distressing automobile accident ,
occurred last Sunday morning about
n mile from Farmington, on the Flat
River road just beyond the County
Infirmary, in which Mrs. Katie Acuff
was instantly killed, her husband, W.
M. AcufT, suffered a broken leg below
the left knee, their daughter, Gladys,
was considerably bruised but other
wise unhurt, and Miss Lottie Herzog,
daughter of Frank Herzog of Ste.
Genevieve, suffered a scalp wound
about five inches long, exposing the
bone but hot fracturing the skull. All
of them lived in Ste. Genevieve.
It is not clear just how the acci
dent occurred or what caused it. Mr.
AcufT, who was a demonstrator of
the machine he was driving, had mo
tored over with the party from Ste.
Genevieve to Flat River, and they
were on their way to Knob Lick, via
Farmington, to visit Mr. Acuff's fa
ther and take him home with them.
At the place where the accident oc
curred the road coming toward Farm
ington descends a long steep hill,
makes a curve and crosses a creek on
a culvert. The machine came down
the hill at high speed and was mak
ing the curve when, Mr. Acuff says,
something went wrong with the steer
ing gear or the wheels, and the ma
chine was overturned, throwing all
four of the occupants out and over
the side of the road into the ditch.
The machine turned a complete som
ersault lighting right side up on the
four and pinning them underneath.
Some man, whose name we have fail
ed to learn, was motoring behind
them end came up immediately after
thn nf.piilf.Tf trioH in lift the mnpliinr

came over from Ste. Genevieve, and
Mr. Frederick Acuff of Knob Lick,
father of W. M., two sons, T. J. and
Patrick Acuff, and daughter, Mrs.
Eva Draper, came over from Knob
Lick. It was decided to take the body
of Mrs. Acuff to Bismarck for inter
ment, but on account of her aged
mother who lived with her and is 87
years old and very feeble, they con
cluded that it should be taken home
first, that the venerable mother might

who on account of his condition was
not permitted to go, and made the
sorrowful journey to the stricken
home in Ste. Genevieve. On Tuesday
the body was taken to Bismarck to
be laid at rest. The funeral was at
tended by many relatives and sym
pathizing friends from Ste. Genevieve,
Knob Lick and other points.
W. M. Acuff formerly lived at Bis
marck and for a number of years was
employed as a brakeman on the Iron
Mountain railroad and the Illinois
Southern between Bismarck and Ste.

FARMINGTON GETS NEXT
S. E. MO. PRESS ASSOCIATE
DeSoto Contributed Much to Success
of the Meeting at That Place
Last
The annual meeting of the South
east Missouri Press Aassociation,
which was held in DeSoto last Friday
and Saturday, was perhaps the most
successful and enjoyable that Asso
ciation has ever held. All who at
tended were unanimous in the opin
ion that DeSoto is a good old town,
filled with clever and hospitable peo
ple, and all present were apparently
delighted that they had the pleasure
of such an enjoyable outing. In fact
that gathering instilled new life and
renewed vigor into the Association,
which for some years past has been
somewhat lacking in preparation and
enthusiasm.
Farmington was successful in se
curing the next annual meeting of the
Association, winning on the first bal
lot over two competitors Frederick
town and Dexter. Farmington was
put in nomination by the retiring
president, Harry Denman, of the
Farmington News, and the splendid
vote she received makes it incumbent
upon every good citizen of this city
to see to it that there is no lax in
bringing forward the many good
things promised the press gang when
they meet here next year. But there
is no doubt, we believe, that Farm
ington will make good and abundant
lyevery assurance Mr. Denman gave
to secure this gathering, the splendid
handling of which will mean so much
for the reputation of this city, which
is already noted for its splendid abil
ity to entertain. But more of this
later.
Every session of the meeting in De
Soto, which was ably presided over by
President Denman, was full of inter
est to every newspaper man. Many
splendid papers were read, some of
which we hope to be able to present
to Times readers soon. The meetings
were held in the Elks Club Rooms, a
lurge and splendidly arranged second
floor space. Charley Mitchell, editor
of the Press of that city, was always
within calling distance, ready to fur
nish anything not plainly in sight.
Bro. Mitchell is also postmaster, be
ing in charge of the splendid new
government- building there, which is
the finest structure in that city. In
fact, we do not see how DeSoto could
keep up its various enterprises were
7,000 MINERS MADE GLAD
All St. Francois Lead Companies Give
Men 30 Per Cent Bonus Raise
Bonne Terre, May 3. Payment to
day of an additional 10 per cent bonus
by the mining companies added to
the 20 per cent bonus already being
paid, marks the high tide of mine
wages in the St. Francois county Lead
Belt. The operating companies are
St. Joe Lead, Desloge Consolidated,
Doe Run Lead, Federal Lead, St. Louis
Smelting and Refining and Buker Lead
companies. The bonus is paid every
pay day, together with the regular
pay check.
The first bonus was paid last June,
it being 10 per cent. In February the
bonus check was raised to 20 per cent
and the present bonus makes it 30
per cent. More than 7,000 men are
affected.
The extra money is being spent
with a lavish hand, many men taking
MANY THANKS
Prof. G. W. Moothart, of the Ozark
Business College, yesterday paid The
Times the following compliment,
which we highly appreciate:
"Permit me to compliment you and
your able staff for giving to the cit
izens of this county in general, such
a pure, unflinching exposition of
Democratic doctrine. Keep up the
good work and The Times will play
a very important factor this fall in
landing candidates on the right side
of victory."
ANOTHER NICE BUNCH
Though the weather conditions the
past week have been generally gloomy,
The Times has no reason to complain
of a lack on the part of the people
in handing in new and renewal sub
scriptions, indicating that they are
able to overcome depressing weather
in order to get the news also that
they know where the news is to be
secured.

odds the busiest man we saw there.
It is true we saw many busy men
there, but only one Mitchell.
Practically the whole of DeSoto's.
business section lays along a single
street, paralleling the Iron Mountain
railroad, for a distance of about a
half mile, built compactly and filled
with up-to-date businesses. Here al
so are to be found "several reasons."
DeSoto was primarily a railroad town,
and still has extensive yards and shops
of the Iron Mountain, which employs
several hundred men. A branch of
the Peters Shoe Factory is also locat
ed there, which employs several scores
of men, and adds very materially to
the pay roll. It also has considerable
good farming territory to draw trade
from, and keeps up a very creditable
fair, on a strictly mutual plan. This
fair has been in successful operation
for the past seven years, and is now
regarded as a formidable asset to
the town.
The residence portion can scarcely
be seen fiom the business street, but
a closer inspection discloses many
splendid and commodious residences,
in the midst of well kept lawns, mak
ing really ideal surroundings. The
splendidly improved and well kept
streets also add much to the beauty
of the surroundings. Neither can the
extent of the residence portion be ful
ly realized until a trip through that
section has been made. Such a trip
brings the conviction that DeSoto is
really a splendid residence city.
Saturday afternoon an automobile
trip was made to the county seat of
Hillsboro, when a comparatively few
of the editorial party who still re
mained were taken on that delightful
drive. Hillsboro is indeed a quaint
little town, with a court house, which
is the principal thing to be seen there,
aside from its hospitable population,
though it has two very creditable
newspapers. This trip was a fitting
finale of a most enjoyable meeting,
giving, as it did, the party a bird's
eye view of some of the hills and vales
of Jefferson county, which has but re

the opportunity to buy hom.'s. The
Doe Run Lead Co. at Flat River is
putting up a big power plant to fur
nish electricity for the entire Lead
Belt. The Federal, at Flat River, is
building a new lead mill and the Baker
Lead, at Elvins, is sinking a new shaft
and putting up a plant.
Labor of all kinds is hard to get
and in greater demand than at any
time in the history of the county.
Monday the foreigners at Doe Run
shafts 1, 3 and 4 went on strike and
caused a partial close-down for lack
of shovelcrs. They demanded a raise
in pay from $2.40 to $3.50 without
any bonus, and a reduction of the
minimum requirement of 22 cars of
rock per day to 20 cars. All shafts
except No. 1 had enough shovelers to
night. CUNNINGHAM SECURES
JUDGMENT AGAINST ELVINS
At the May term of the St. Fran
cois Countv Circuit Court Georgo B.
Cunningham filed suit against Politte
Elvins for balance due under contract.
After two continuances Mr. Elvins
took a change of venue to Iron county,
where the case was tried last week,
resulting in a judgment for Mr. Cun
ningham. Mr. Cunningham contracted to drill
a woll for Mr. Elvins. After drilling
the well 576 feet Mr. Elvins pail him
$720 but refused to pay a claimed bal
ance of $349.50. Mr. Cunningham
' claimed that the contract was for
$1.25 per foot for the first 100 feet
and 25 cents per foot raise for each
extra hundred feet. Mr. Elvins
claimed that the well was crooked, by
reason of which he had been damaged
$607, and which he asked for in a
counter claim.
Many witnesses were compelled to
be in Ironton three days, and when the
jury reached the case on Saturday af
ternoon it took them but twenty min
utes to decide in favor of Mr. Cun
ningham, who was represented by
Attorneys Francis A. Benham of
Farmington, assisted by Mr. Damron
of Ironton. Mr. Elvins was represent
