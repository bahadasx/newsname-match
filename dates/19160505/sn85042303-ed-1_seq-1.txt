ness to Make Peace on Terms Safeguarding Her Vital In
terests, but Proposals Were of No Avail.
Berlin, May 5. The German reply to the American note
on the submarine question was delivered to Ambassador Gerard
this morning and was immediately transmitted by the Ameri
can ambassador to his government.
The note says that Germany is fully alive to the possibility
that it was a German submarine which attacked the Sussex,
but begs to reserve further communication on this matter until
additional points have been ascertained. Should a further in
vestigation show that the submarine commander acted wrongly
in assuming that the Sussex was a warship, Germany will "not
fail to draw the consequences resulting therefrom."
The note emphatically repudiates the American assertion
that the Sussex attack was but one instance of deliberate meth
ods of destruction of vessels of all nationalities and for all des
tinations. , , , , . . .
It reiterates that Germany imposed far-reaching restric
tions on the submarine use, conditions which England never
shows neutrals. The note says England is trying to starve the
civil population of Germany and Germany cannot abandon her
submarine warfare against the enemy trade, but has now de
cided to make further concessions by adapting submarine war
fare to the neutrals' interests.
The note says England has flatly refused to grant the
American demands relative to international law. The German
people are under the impression that the United States while
demanding that Germany, who is struggling for her existence,
shall restrain the use of the submarine, if friendly relations are
o continue, confines itself merely to protests against the illegal
acts of Germany's enemies. Germany is willing to observe in
ternational law if England does likewise and hopes that the
United States will now insist that England observe recognized
international procedure. Meanwhile Germany has ordered her
naval forces to operate in accordance with the general principle
of visit and search both within and without the war zone. Ships
will not be sunk without warning and without the saving of
human lives unless the ship attempts to escape or oiler resist-
mpp- liermany uoes nui uuuut
nited States.
The note says Washington fa'led to
substantiate the charges of indiscrim
inate submarine usage by not giving
concrete facts and points out that er
rors are likely to occur and did ac
tually occur in some instances in Ger
man warfare and asserts that there
are unavoidable dangers when neutrals
V enter the war zone, recalling the fact
that Germany frequently pointed out
" these dangers. The United States un
fortunately failed to accept the Ger
man proposals to keep travelers out
of the danger zone.
The note says that disregard of the
principles of international law 'by
England forced Germany to use the
submarine. Germany "fails to under
stand" what it styles the "discrimina
tion" of the United States against Ger
many and iu behalf of England, who
is not conducting warfare along inter
natinnni lines. The note says Ger-
many regrets that the "sentiments of I United States. In view of these con
humanity which the United States ex- ditlons, it must be understood that the

cording to the avowed intentions of
England shall bo starved, and who by
their suffering shall force the victori
ous armies of the central powers into
ignominious capitulation."
"The German people know," it says,
"that the United States has power to
confine the war to the armed forces of
the belligerent countries in the inter
est of humanity and maintenance of
international law, and the United
States could make certain this end by
.taking a determined stand against Eng
land on the uncontrovertible rights to
freedom of the seas."
The note says that the German pro
pie know to what considerable extent
the entente allies are supplied with
all kinds of war materials from the
j German people cannot meet witn
hearty response the American ap
peal for humanity. Germany, howev
er is willing to go to extreme limits
in making concessions, guided not
alone by friendship but also by the
great "doom which threatens the civ

longed." Germany twice rcently, it says, con

WILSON READING IT it
Washington, May Presi- a
dent Wilson and the cabinet it
members carefully studied the
pross dispatch version of the
German note today. The first
feeling that it was unsatisfac
tory was somewhat leavened
by the new orders given to
the submarine commanders.
No decision will be attempted
until the official text is re
ceived from Ambassador Ger
ard, aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
her willingness to make peace on a
basis safe-guarding her vital interests
and says she is willing to do her ut
most during the rest of the war to
confine the operations to lighting the
forces of belligerents if the freedom
of the seas is assured.
The note concludes that should the
steps taken not obtain the objects de
sired in the interest of humanity?,
then Germany faces a new situation
in which she must reserve to itself
complete liberty of act.
REPUBLICANS AND SOCIALISTS
ARE ALL GETTING ON THE
ROLLS WHILE THE DOMINANT
PARTY SEEMS INDIFFERENT. .
The democrats of this city and
county are rather slow in getting re
gistered according to reports of regis
ters, and unless they "whip up" the
chances are that many will he denied
the ballot at the primary and general
election this fall.
More democrats are complaining of
the difficulty of locating the register
in every precinct than others of the
two opposing parties, and they are yet
wondering if a certain designated place
will be set out by the county register
where they can go at a certain time
and have their names enrolled. If
this is not done, prominent democrats
over the city and county say that
there will be many disfranchised.
There is another theory advanced
by a prominent democrat and politi
cian this morning that might be worth
watching. He says that old line demo
crats who have been voting since
statehood will probably insist on vot
ing in the coming elections whether
they are registered or not. This wi'.I
lead to contests if they are permitted
to do so. Therefore lie advocates that
the registers make a special effort to
ret every voter in the precincts to
register during the time allotted.

T
PLANS HAVE BEEN PRACTICALLY
AGREED UPON AND BUILDING
WILL BE ERECTED DURING
PRESENT YEAR.
That Ardniore will have a com
modious new union depot within the
next few months is now practically a
certainty. The plans have been
drawn and have been under discus
sion between the Santa Fe and Hock
Island companies for agreement.
They have practically been agreed to,
and unless unforseen contingencies
arie, work will begin within a short
time.
The Santa Fe, in addition to the
U'lion station, will also erect a freight
house of concrete and brick on the
site of the one destroyed by the ox
plosion of September 27 last. This
will be :!00x:!2 feet and will be mod
ern in every particular.
The site of the new union station
will be somewhat north of where the
old station stood, and the platforms
will extend from Broadway to M.i'n
street. The express ofllce will bJ
rorth of the station, as it was nn'3"r
the old arrangement. Santa Fe of
ficials nere say they cannot tell Just
when work will begin on the depot,
but give assurance that when it is
finished it will be a structure of
which the city can be proud. The
local agent stated that he was not
prepared to discuss the plans at pres
ent, as there might be some minor
changes made before work is begun
on the building.

ASSISTANT STATE LABOR COM
MISSIONER WAS IN THE CITY
YESTERDAY INVESTIGATING LO
CAL CONDITIONS.
Mike Williams, assistant state labor
commissioner, was in the city yester
day investigating conditions with re
gard to the nine-hour law as applied
to female employes. Mr. Williams was
sent here upon complaint of some
one who averred that the law was
being violated and asserted that he
found in some instances that it had
been unintentionally perhaps, but vio
lated nevertheless. A warning was
given to discontinue this practice and
to observe the letter of the law in the
future, jnr prosecution wouid follow.
Mr. Williams while here was in con
ference with several ladies of local
labor unions and getting their views
on local conditions and how the laws
governing labor were being enforced.
Mr. Williams refused to state where
he found the practice of working wo
men over the prescribed hours, but
stated that he had no fear but what
in the future the law would be ob
served in every particular.

FETING
ATTENDED BY
E
CITIZENS MEET WITH CITY OF
FICIALS TO DISCUSS WHITE
WAY AND THE NEW SANITARY
ORDINANCE.
The advertised meeting to discuss
the white way and the new health
ordinance brought out between forty
and fifty people to the assembly
room of the chamber of commerce
yesterday evening. The absence of
anything but a negligible number
of business men prompted acting
Mavor hastier, who presided, to leave
the discussion of the white way to
a future meeting to bo arranged by
Walter S. Gilbert, secretary of the
Husiness Men's association. Mr. Gil
bert informed the mayor that he
wou'd bring the matter up at the
meeting of the business men on Mon-
day
night, and the mayor and com-
mi."
ssioners will l.e present at thy
meeting.
Mayor Lasher then went into the
sanitary ordinance and made a cle;:r
cut statement that the commission
ers wanted to know just what the
people wanted. He called attention
to the fact that Ardniore was no
longer a little town, but a city a'ld
that it must have laws for the pro
tection of the health of the com
munity. He expressed the belief
that every citizen would agree with
him and asked that the meeting be
in the nature of a conference with
that end in view, and not one of
knocks and kicks at the admin
istration. No Service, No Pay
The speech had its effect if any
present had come to criticize, and
in the rational discussion which foh
lowed it soon developed that, the
only mistake that had been mado had
been the attempt to collect for ser
vice which had not been rendered.
All commissioners, however, assured
those present that no fee would be
1 collected except where th- service
! had been rendered, and that in en
forcing the ordinance they wou'd not
force the service of the ei'y waons
on any individual, hut that they
would compel every citizen to Ueep
their premises clean and sanitary.
Some complaint of the scale of
charge was made, but it was prom
ised and pointed out that the orJi
nance provided for adjuslnu-nt.i to
be made. It was also pointed out
that the first clean-up would be the
heaviest, and that 173 wagon loads
of refuse and garbage had already
been taken out of the busineii section.

TABERNACLE
AS THEY MARCHED IN SINGING
"AT THE CROSS" EVANGEL
IST TAKES TEXT FROM JOHN
7-17.
A very large audience greeted the
minister last night. It was Wood
men night, and the Woodmen, tho
Woodmen Circle, and the Woodmen's
girls were in line, hundreds strong.
It was a revelation of many to seo
so many members of the order. Led
by Mr. Poulter, they sang "At. tho
Cross" with a will.
Tonight is High school night
watch them come.
Dr. Williams preached from the
text, "If any man will do his will
he shall know of the doctrine wheth
er it be of God or whether I speak;
of myself." John 7-17.
"This was Jesus answer to the
doubters and skeptics. If you want
to prove a principle, follow it out.
Knforce a law, and if a bad law )t
will soon be changed. It does not
take much brains to find fault, but to
live the teachings of Christ requires
sense and character. Many peopl3
are sensible about business, and fool
ish about religion.
"The hypocrites In the church are
the excuses given by many for re
maining in sin. These people know
one hypocrite and imagine all the
church to be of such. Some one has
heard of an apparent inconsistency
in the bible, and they imagine tho
entire book composed of inconsist
encies. The trouble is not with tho
great book, but with our method of
approaching it. If you want to live,
a good life, God will help you to
do it. Follow the bible and light
will come as you need it. God's
promises are sure and have never
failed. You need not stumble over
the hypocrites in the church. They
are really not as numerous as you
think. A hypocrite is a counterfeit
of a genuine Christian. Why not
be the genuine, and so live that your
eternity will not be spent with tho
hypocrite? There are but two class
esthe regenerate and the unregen
erate. The one w ho Bays he does not
like Christianity really is bad at
heart If we obey we shall know
the truth of the bible and the prom
ises of God.
