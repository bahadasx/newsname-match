''And what wilt ybu dd with llRrty?'''
csked Mrs. Avery.
"He could stay where be is. I don't
' want to marry a fireman."
"Theip'a a widow's pension goes
with i Jess, mind," her mother said
soothingly. "And Barty's a fine lad
altogether. It's a sight better than
watching from that window for Mr
tyelguardo to show up again," .
v Jess flushed, Mowly leaning her.
chin on her hand. It was a pretty
chin and It was a pretty hand. She
had not lived her life out down in
the basement by a long shot. From
six to fifteen she bad been in a con
vent up the Hudson, and when she
gave the girls her address she always,
said she lived down In the old Wash-,
ington Square studio district, which
was quite true; but she did not add
that her father was a Janitor.
Always they had accused her of
building castles in Spain and longing
for the things she could never have.
It had been a joke for years Jess
and her high-flying notions and then
out of the blue sky almost there had
dropped a real live gentleman from
Spain. Antonio Delguajdo, an artist
who took the third flood studio, paid
his rent in advance and acted like- a
grandee.
"Before his coming, Jess had gon
out for an evening walk with Barry
now and then when he was off duty,
and had even taken In the theaters
with him, or an occasional trip to the
beach, but one day when she was
sweeping the basement steps Mr. Del
gardo had -stopped at the little Iron
grill gate to ask it the mail had
come, and Jess had told him she
would take it up to the studio for
him.
.. "Ah, no, senorita, not at all," he
had declined. "I will myself descend
' for it It Is not for you to come so
far, I thank you."
The whole world turned a somer
sault for, Jess right there and then.
Here was one human being who rec
opnlzed at a glance that she did not
belong to the basement stratum. When
the postman whistled, Mr. Delguardo
came talsurely down and received his
mail, and he bowed to her and smiled.
One day she w& directing the vacuum-cleaner
man around the house,
and came to the studio. She opened Us
door delicately and stared. Could
the grandee be doing light housekeep
ing? There was what seemed to be
an alcohol Btove, but of a strange pat
" . tern, also some peculiar bowls of
dark metal, much burned, and other
tilings, including bottles full of liquids
like photographic chemicals. All were
rather mysterious. And while she stood
- irresolute the gentleman from Spain
walked In. His eyebrows lifted slight
ly at the sight of her. He seemed sur
prised more, grieved. Jess was all
blushes and anxiety, as she explained.
His tone was soothing.
"It is nothing, senorita. It was the
dazzle of sunlight in my poor studio
that bewildered me for the Instant
I thank you. I kiss your hand in
token."
Now Jess bad never had her hand
Visaed before, and she went out a
queen. When he brought her a gar
denia that evening it seemed all part
of the new wonder of life, a single
gardenia given with such a bow and
look. Jess was standing out on the
front steps listening to the band over
" In the square, and she lifted the flower
to her nostrils, Inhaling Us perfume
luxuriously after he had goue up.
"My, 'tis hot, ain't it, Jess?" said
Mrs. Avery, coming heavily up out of
the basement for a breath of air.
But just at this moment two strange
gentlemen paused at the steps and in
quired for Mr. Delguardo.
"He's not had visitors before," Mrs.
Avery speculated.
Jess was silent. Vaguely her castle
1n Spain was taking Bhape, and she
glided through its black and white
marble corridors and watched from its
terraces for Senor Delguardo, or
' would they call him Don, she won
dered dreamily.
It was about three minutes after
jfcro ascent of the two callers when
there came a smothered explosion
from the third floor studio. Some
body turned iu a fire alarm at the
corner, and It was Uarty's company
from gyer pnJJreerchjtrset tfeat
responded. Jess stood down" in the
hall when he passed by and he stopped
just loDg enough to say: "The bulls
got Delguardo."
Sire bad seen It herself her gran
dee with a handcuff on one wrist, puss
ing out of the house In custody, lift
father was busy telling the police"
man about it and she heard. Dsl
guardd was a receiver of stolen gold.
He melted It up neatly into Ingots In
his tidy little llght-housekeepttiii
utensils, and his name was not Del
guardo. It was "Gulney Jack."
Somewhere at her feet lay the far
denia. Unconsciously, Jess' arms were"
like her mother's when Mrs. Avery
was on the offensive akimbo a la
County Llmorick.
Smoky and dripping, Unfty was thS
last to leave, after the. fireman Mad
extinguished the blaze Mr. Delguatdii
had started by trying to ignite the
alcohol and escape In the excitement
"How about tho movies tomorrow
night, girlie?" he aBked.
The castle in Spain became a mir
age. It seemed good to strike earth
again. Barty's foot crushed the gar
denia as he gave her hand a squeeze
and followed the rest out,
