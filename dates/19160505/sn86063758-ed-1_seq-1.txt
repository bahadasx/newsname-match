MEETING OF STATE WAREHOUSE
ASSOCIATION WEDNESDAY
Request of State Convention Made?
McLaurin Will Run for Lieutenant
Governor, if Necessary.
Columbia, May 3?At a largely attended
meeting of the South Carolina
Mlarehouse association, held in ' the
fho Warehouse com
VWVCO VI VV WV_..
mission today, pursuant to the call
recently issued by President J. Arthur
Banks, it was unanimously expressed
as the sentiment of the meeting
that there should be a campaign
this summer in the interest of the
system, and its further enlargement
and development, and that the Statej
warehouse commissioner, Senator
Jno. L. McLaurin, was the proper
maa to make it. The action of the association
was embodied in a resolution
introduced hy Hon. E. W. Dabbs,
former president of the State Farmers
union, requesting the State Dem
ocratic convention, which meets next
f Wednesday, to grant Senator McLaurin
an hour's time at each of the regular
campaign meetings this summer.
The resolution--was signed by those
present,.and will be formally pre-'
seated as a memorial to the State
convention. , i .
President J. Arthur Banks called
the meeting to order promptly at 2:30
o'ciock. In a ringing address he reviewed
the State warehouse system,
beginning with the efforts of Senator
McLaurin for the passage of the
law, and telling, from personal
knowledge, as well as close observait

ed in the money centrec and the \
great benefit which it had been to
the people not only of South Carolina,1
Obut of the entire South, in a time ci i
financial depression, when money
> was not to be had at any price, be-'
cause the Southern banks did not
it to lend. He told of the op^^position
which it had encountered at
every step. '*It has got the strongest,
shrewdest, best-organized eaemies
of anything in this State," he said, j
There has been a struggle against it'
from its inception, and there is still
a struggle, and if you don't get to
-gether a;:d organize your forces and
stand together behind some man of
devotion and zeal and ability, they j
will finally whip you to death. And
that is the reason I called this meet-;
ing together?for the purpose of\get-j
ting together oa a campaign of edu-;
cation, so that the people of every
State may know what the warehouse
system is, and know what it means,
and know its possibilities of good for
the whole -South. When the people j
once know it, it will sever die, be- j
cause it is sound?sound absolutely.
Nobody has ever been able to pick a
flaw in it."
Hon. W. tA. Siuckey of BishoiJville
said that he felt the time had come
to present a bold front, and simply
declare to the public what it was i
proposed to do. This was a nonpartisan
body, he said, and a cam- *
paign of education was needed. He
moved that a campaign be started today
in -behalf of the State warehouse,
to agitate and discuss it before the '
people of South Carolina, regardless j'
-of factional politics. "In . an issue |'
^ 3&e this we should be great enough 11
to rise above factionalism, and we !
?toul^see to it that our (members of '
4?re general assembly are !
straight State warehouse men?men <
whose speech, when they say so, 1
comes not -only from their mouths, '
.'but from the ftbuadaace of their 1
fcAarta." 1

| remarks being frequeutly interrupted
by enthusiaistic applause:
In my annual report to the general
I
assembly 1 referred to the persistent
fight made against the State Warelicuse
System its business success
an admitted fact wherever operated,
j the opposition united in an endeavor
| to defeat my re-election, by centreing
| their strength behind a cotton buyer.
The attempt to draw factional lines;,
be it said to the everlasting credit
oi" the legislature, proved a miserable
failure. Then they tried the subtle
plan of cutting the appropriation,
ai:d not permitting the use of the revenue
derived from the system for its
further development. Mait-oacKea
young lawyers were the mouth-piece
of the opposition, but the agricultural
committee rallied the business and
farming element, and took the legisj
lation away from the ways and means
and judiciary committees, thereby de!
feating their plan.
Human greed is a powerful incenj
tive, and interests preying upoa the
| producer will ever fight any change
which interferes with middle-mea's
profits. As usual, the big interests
combined. I have never seen such a
lobby as they had here to pre vest a
licensed -grader's bill and insurance
legislation.
These people have the power of
money behind them. >They control
the big daily papers, and act as a
unit.
We are not waging war on individuals.
iWe are fighting to reform an
unjust economic system; yet the attack
is centred on me personally.
While we are not responsible for insurance
legislation, yet the State sys- j
tem must bear the burden of the
fight, and assume the task of de^

It is a business question, not politi- j
cal nor class, and I pity the man
whose contracted soul does r.ot consider
it of greater importance to
South Carolina, than his individual
calling, or the particular political
facton to which he belongs. The coming
campaign will revolve around the
State warehouse system, and it is our
duty to let the people know who is
serving them, to what end, and for
whose benefit.
In the insurance matter, 1 advo- j
cate an amendment to the warehouse
law permitting the commissioner, under
proper restrictions, to carry a !
portico of the risk and re-insure the ,

paid out over fifty thousand dollars i
in premiums, and had less than j
twelve hundred dollars of losses. By !
a proper distribution of risks, wej
carry State cotton, and in a few years |
have a reserve fund sufficient to
make the cost of insurance almost'
nominal.
The con-spiracy in Columbia which .
fomented the withdrawal of the
companies should be fully exposed,!
aud can be, from the records in my J
hands. The federal government reg- j
ulates interest rates, banks, railroads .
and telegrraph companies, and if it'
>><? nnwpp tr> romnel the in
?T - - I
surance companies to do business in
Scuth Carolina, or quit doing busi-j
:.ess in the United States, then we ,
had better get some new members
of congress.
The State warehouse is not the so- ^
lution, it is only, the means. We must j
have sufficient warehouse room to
carry the surplus in each county. 'The?
county should be the unit ia financing
and marketing the crop, with all
the county houses federated !nto a
State-wide system. Little can be ac- j
complished in marketing until the
farmers are aroused to the necessity
>f co-operation. We axe now the easy .
prey of unscrupulous money lenders,
Insurance trust, fertilizer trust, ex*
porters, and all of the other parasites j
that grow fat on the manipulation of
farm products.
The Lord helps those who help'
hemsehes. fW% have the foundation
in the State warehouse for the organization
of farm insurance, rural 1
credit unions, and a farmer's hank
operating under the federal reserve
system. We must have licensed grad-1

The .necessary educational cami-aign
cannot be made through daily
newspapers, because they are owned
by tho?e whose interests are antagonistic
to us. I agree with you that
we must make an educational campaign,
and as you designate me, 1
cheerfully assume the burden and
will do the best I can.
Let us go forward, sustained by
faith in God and trust in the good
people of South Carolina.
I want nothing personally. This
work lifts me above sordid political
ambition. Don't worry about my reward.
I will get more out of it tha:i
office holds. I will receive that enlargement
of life which comes to
every one who unselfishly serves his
fellowman. All the politicians in

me this. It is God's gift.
The State warehouse system is
worth fighting for. It is the first distinct
attempt .by this government to
aid the creators of all wealth, by utilizing
the public credit in their ber
half. State receipts are discounted
by member banks at three per cent.,
and tlie farmer gets the money at
six. His cotton is in the form .of a
negotiable security, like the bond of
a corporation. This means equal pHvileges.
The next step is a system of .
credit based on land. It is easier and!
simpler than one based on cotton.

There is a studied attempt to prevent
information from reaching the
people. Every effort has been' made
to poison the publio mind and destroy
confidence in me. They allege that
the whole thing is politics. I tried
to go before the people fourteen j
years ago, and the politicians chang-1
ed the party rules to shut me out.
The intervening time has been one

Individually we are powerless to J

so through a political mechanism,
