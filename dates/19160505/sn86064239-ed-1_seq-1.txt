I .im thoroiiKhly convinced that the
City oftiiiyder is sorely In need of v.
modern fire-Unlit Ilk equipment, and
the City Council has taken steps with
a view of Improving the situation. I
liuv' appointed a cltlxene committee,
also a committee from the city conn-
ell to work III conjunction in the
cause, to wait upon every cftlien for
donations, the result of which, I trust
will soon develop. The equipment will
be adequate to reach all sections of
(he resldenee portion, nn well as burli
ness seel Ions, so be as liberal as pos
sible. The idea is to obtain upuni'aliiH
sufficient to lower the ki y rale of In-
Miiranpe, llius Having our people much
more than a modern equipment will
cost, within a short term of years.
