Washington, May 5. A high offi
cial here Huld tUat apparently there
was nothing in the German reply
that would justify a break in relations
between the two nations.
It was evident that the members of
the cabinet viewed the situation opti

Washington, May 5. President Wil
son and his cabinet will begin their
consideration of the German reply
as soon as the last vital paragraph of
the note arrives.
From a consideration of tho piece
meal version before the cabinet the
members are convinced, it is under
stood, that Germany bus met the de
mands of the United States govern

the conditions that Germany includ

STODDARD HOME
House is Entered While Family at Church;
Auto Vanishes but is Recovered;
Suit Case is Swiped from Car
on Street
Judging from , reports received by
the police, petty thievery in Chicka
sha is assuming the proportions of an
epidemic. A wide variety of tastes
Is manifested by the light-fingered
fellows who are operating, running
all the way from ice cream and spring
chickens to autos and diamonds.
One would scarcely have thought
there were so many chickens, the
feathered kind, in Chickasha, as have
been totaled In the complaints filed
with the police during the last forty
eight hours by parties whose, tea
roosts have been invaded and whose
chickens have been carried off to be
butchered to make uome one a holi
day dinner.
According to telephonic . complaints
the chicken thieves have not been fas
tidious in the matter of selection of
feathered fowls. The best of the
flock has in no instance been taken,
but the whole shooting match, in
every case reported, has been lifted
by the etiicken fjneier.
One lady reported, the loss of her
flock of twenty hens; another came
iii on the phone wire with the report
of twelve; still another stated that
twenty-five chickens and thirty pig-
eons had vamoosed in the dark of the
moon while a negro living in the
"Two" street neighborhood reported
to the police that twenty fine birds
had left his hen roost at the instiga
tion of and aided and abetted by
some "triflin' no 'count nigga."
Chief Phillips stated this morning
that should the chicken stealing con
tinue he would be forced to put on a
special officer to walk in the resi
dence districts.
Jewels Are Stolen.
Mrs. M. A. Stoddard, residing at 409
South Eighth Btreet, has reported to
the police the ioss, through burglars,
of a diamond ring, a cameo ring, a
lady's watch and other jewelry. Her
house w as entered by burglars, it 'is
stated while the family were absent
at prayer meeting. Entrance to the
house was gained through a rear win
dow. After having secured the jew
elry the burglar calmly unlocked a
rear door and made his get-away.
, Car is Recovered.
Bob Weir reported to the police
this morning that someone had stolen
a demonstration car from In front of
his residence. The police state that
later reports said the car had been
recovered . and that it had probably
been taken by "joy-riders."
Taken from Auto.
Last night a suit rase belonging to
Mrs. Newman, of Kansas, was stolen
from an auto in which it had been
left in front of the Unique cafe.
Mrs. Ola Newman had been visiting
an uncle at Anadnrko and had been
orivcii trom that city to Chickasha,
b auto, to catch the three o'clock
Rock Islnnd train, north.
This morning a lady called police
headquarters and reported seeing a
suit case- in a vacant lot near the
Early hotel. Officers Baird and Ha
ley went to the place indicated in the
phone call' and found the grip. The
lock had been cut away and the case
forced open. An Inventory of the
contents, compared with the list of
articles filed with the police by Mrs.
Newman, showed nothing had been
taken from the grip except a pair of
shoes. The grip was filled with fine
clothing. The police this morning
I forwarded the suit case to the owner

He was one of those wholesome,
good, old fashioned negroes with sa
complexion of .charcoal color and a
wooly head beginning to turn gray
about the temples. He was very
much in earnest when he approached
Officer Marshall and reported to him
that "some scallawag done stole a
ham and a fiddlin of meat from my
house las' night."
Officer Marshall was all sympathy
and promised to do his best in the
matter of running the thief down
and securing for him a first-class
whipping at the hands of justice. The
officer promised the complainant that
should the guilty one be found he
would be sent to the county road
with a good, stiff sentence.

plainant, "I wants my meat. I doan

FARMERS
IN HARVEST
Labor Commissioner Sends Letters to Wheat
Growers to Learn Number of Men
Needed; Seeks to Improve "
Past Methods
W. G. Ashton, state labor commis
sioner, while in Chickasha a day or
so ago, In speaking of the annual de
mand for harvest hands In Oklahoma
each year stated that he thought his
department had done much toward
bolving the problems and rendering
the situation more easily handled than
has heretofore been possible.
Mr. Ahton said that tvery harvest
season for the past several years, has
witnessed the invasion of OklaTioma
by a regiment of harvest hands of
from 10,000 to 12,000 and even 15,000.
These harvest hands, coming from
other states, have been attracted to
Oklahoma's giant harvest fields
through the publicity given Oklaho
ma's mammoth wheat and oats
crops through the press of the state.
Tho harvest situation in Oklahoma
fach year demands a great deal of la
bor which cannot be supplied locally.
Heretofore it has been the custom
to open the gates, and invite, through
the columns of tho newspapers of the
state a rush of all the unemployed of
othrr sections who may care to come
to this state, never stopping to ascer
tain how many harvest hands may be
reeded, nor how many of those who
nl.iy rush across the state line may
i.o supplied with work after they have
uived here. The rule, in other
words, has been to depend upon the
general publicity given Oklahoma
harvest fields by the newspapers to
get harvest bands, in any sized num
bers into Oklahoma and then trust
to luck and the needs of the differ
ent communities in the matter of ap
portioning these laborers out amongst
the farmers in the wheat belts of the
state. ' This system, slip-shod at the
liest. Mr. Ashton says, has been In the
past the origin of great troubles.
Harvest hands have mobilised at dif -
ferent points in numbers far in ex -
cess of .the demands. They have de -
manded work in sections where there
was no work and have demanded that
they be fed and cared for by the pub
lic in the localities which they in
vaded.
Mr. Ashton, in seeking to eliminate
the troubles of the past, is making an
effort to get in touch, with the wheat-
raising farmers of the state. There
are, Mr. Ashton says, over six thous
and wheat raisers in the wheat belts
of Oklahoma. An effort has been
made to get in touch with the major
ity of these, with the biggest wheat
growers in every section of the state
wherein wheat is grown. The wheat
grower is asked how many harvest
hands w ill be needed in his particular
section; how many in a county or a
community. After his answer may be

Compulsory Military Training Makes Aver
age Man There Stronger Physically
and. Better- Fitted for Serving
as Soldier
ALL SCHOOLS MUST
' HAVE GYMNASIUMS
Certain Daily Exercises for Development

Regulations; Boys Join Com

NOTE This is the fourth of
a series of articles by Shep
herd dealing with the Swiss
system of military training for
citizens, in its relation to the
possibilities of a similar sys
tem in the United States.
Editor. '
(By William G. Shepherd, United
Press Correspondent.)
Bering May 4. The average Swiss
man is better physically and as a aol
dier than the average American male,
thanks to the system of compulsory;
military training in Switzerland.
'Gets under the. hide, ..a statement
like this, but it's true. ,
Every , male Swiss can shoot
straighter, run longer, march farther
and endure more than the average
male American. You have only to
know what the Swiss is taught to do
and what the average American Isn't
taught to do to realize that this ia
tme.
Every Swiss school boy MUST go
to a gymnasium. Every Swiss school
must HAVE a gymnasium. It doesn't
matter whether it's a church achool
or a business college or a fancy,
high-priced school for little Swiss
Lord Fauntleroys; it MUST have a
gymnasium.
In this gymnasium MUST be taught
daily, certain exercises prescribed by
the government. These are the high
ly scientific product of the deepest
study in physical development.
The average American doesn't even
know what these exercises are.
Now and then, it is true, after he's
fattening up at thirty, the American
answers an advertisement and pur
chases some alleged scientific physi
cal cu" re book and follows the in
structions therein.
Any Swiss school boy of ten could
teach him a world of valuable things
in this line.
By the time a Swiss school boy ia
twenty he has developed his physique
to its high point.
He has made his body as fine and
strong as hiiK particular body can be
made. .
This has been done scientifically
and meanwhile, the call of his splen.
did muscles has driven him to foot-
: ball and other sports.
! That crowded Polo grounds in New
York makes you sick, when you look
. over these Swiss. You couldn't get
10,000 healthy Swiss to sit around ot
, an afternoon watching OTHER men
1 play a game. Each man wants to play
1 himself. Hundreds of little Bport
i centers are alwavs busy.
That cheering grandstand at the
Polo grounds, filled with men that
couldn't run to first base without
puffing, is a disgusting thought, here
in the war country.
Anything in they world is better than
that. Any pacificist must admit that
even learning how to shoot, out in
the country learning how to shoot
with the intention of killing an ene
my some day if you have to is better
than the average American's silly
MENTAL participation in baseball.
Or( if you're too much ot a baseball
fan, make it Kelly pool.
The average Swiss boy can out
shoot the average American boy.
