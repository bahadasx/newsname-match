The Teton County Sunday
School contest has come to a
conclusion with Cut Bank vic
torious. The contest lasted ten
weeks. Valier, Conrad, Bynum,
Ctoteau and Cut Bank were the
competing towns.
The percentage of increase
for the ten Sundays of the con
test was: Cut Bank 103.5; By
num: 91.9: Choteau 73. The bas
is was made the average at
tendance for the months of
November and January.
The Cut Bank Scholars threw
themselves enthusiastically in
to the contest from the start,
and this explains the wonder
ful record made. The lowest
attendance on any Sunday was
81: the highest 175. The entire
attendance was 1241. The
average attendance was more
than doubled.
The friendly rivalry has been
productive of much good, and
the Cut Bank School proposes
to go on to greater things.
A Momentous Discovery
A couple of prominent mem
bers of the local Wilson club
were observed at an early hour
Wednesday morning gazing
mournfully at some far point
low on t h e western horizon.
When interviewed by a repre
sentative of the Pioneer Press
the gentlemen had nothing to
say; but it is conjectured that
they had just discovered the
rapidly declining Star of Dem
ocracy. This is important, if
true, and a meeting of the club
will be held in Donahue's bar
ber shop Monday evening to
consider the matter.

cil met Tuesday evening and
organized as follows: President,

I HAVE A BUYER
for your farm if it is priced right. 320 acres pre
ferred. He has a first class business property in Cut
Bank to trade in on the deal and will pay the differ
ence in cash. This property rents for $20 per
month and with a small expenditure can be rented
for $50 per month.
Don't call if you are going to boost the price of
your farm 'way above what you would take in cash,
as we know what we can buy farm land for.

Messrs. McFatridue, Steele,
Crerar, Whistler and Perrine went
to Choteau to attend a good roads
convention of some sort, and came
home very much the result of a bad
road in the county seat neighbor
hood. Mr. Perrine, we understand,
had a tooth broken off, while Mr.
McPatridge's friends hardly recog
nized their old neighbor. The mis
hap took place at a poorly-built
culvert. And yet we pay road-tax
to fix just such places. What be
comes of the road-tax, anyway?
I have decided not to buy that
Packard until the roads are fixed.
My old bay team is good enough
for me. Timeo Danaos!
The Hamilton delegation came
back from Washington Saturday,
claimiug that the Walsh bill now
up in the Senate was a compromist
secured by them aftei a tremendous
tight. So the present bill is a glo
rious victory for the Hamilton dele
tion, and also a triumph for the op
position faction. Good! Victorj
all round! Now we will have a peace
within our tribal borders such as
would warm the hearts of Carnegie,
Bryan and Henry Ford. Hooray!
Ilev. Dr. Gold attended lodge ai
Cut Pank Friday night.
Several of the employes of the
Iudiau school were up to the picture
show one night last week.
Some of the stockmen have re
turned from the south with imnort
ed cattle. New blood is a good
thing, when the old has become im
poverished. It is the mixture in
the American that has placed him
ahead of all other nations. That is
why we "ecrap" inefficient methods
so quickly.
Mr. Funk, of the Reclamation of
fice is now stationed at Seville, look
ing after the ditches.
The new offices at the Agency
will greatly facilitate the handling
of the business at headquarters.
Many of our people have been
vaccinated as the result of the small
pox scare, which is now happily a
thing of the past.
Many friends from the surround
ing country met in a social way ai
the home of Mr. and Mrs. George
Paisley on St. Marys r ver lasi
week.
Mr. Selecman has made a fine
record here as principal of o u r
schools this year, and the same
thing can be said of all the teachers.
Do we stop often enough to consider
how much we owe to the school
teacher? And, indeed, how much
we owe to the scLool board?
Seediug is progressing in the
Heart Butte neighborhood. That
is the habitat of the big potato,
onion, beet and turn in. Watch
Heart Butte at our next fall Indian
fair.
Dr. Nelson Here
Dr. R. G. Nelson returned
from Kalispell Wednesday
night after spending a week at
the Flathead metropolis. His
health is much improved and
he is now able to look after his
practice here.
Odd Fellows'
Open House
What many describe as the
grandest time they have evei
enjoyed in Cut Bank wai
pulled off Friday night in the
Oddfellows' Hall. The progran
consisted of recitations, songs,
speeches and recreative games
T. B.Bomboy acted the part ol
mine host to the large compan>
present. He was toast master,
roast master and floor-managei
combined. He called on Rev.
Alexander Pringle who gave
the statistics of the order in the
United States and Montana,
which were stimulating, indeed,
to the pulse of the loyal Odd
fellow. Nearly ninteen millior
dollars, last vear, was raisec
and expended by the Odd
fellows' lodges of the countn
There are fifty homes for ok
Oddfellows in the United States,
jnd the increase in the numbei
of new lodges organized was
larger proportionately during
the past year than during any
year in the history of the order,
which has now passed its nine
ty-seventh birthday in the
United States.
Dorothea Halvorson was then
introduced and gave a recitation
on the "Grouchy at Home and
Pleasant Abroad" type of hub
by that brought down tht
house. Dr. Gold of Browning
was then called upon for a
speech that kept the audience
in good humor, with stories and
sage advice, together with an
eulogy on the spirit and progress
of Odd Fellowship. Dr. Gold is
well known here and his many
friends heard him gladly, as
they are always ready to do.
After the literary part of tht
program and many congratula
tory remarks by members of
the Order supper was an
nounced by the ladies and a
good social time had around the
festive board, in a feast ol
reason and a flow of soul. The
next stage of the evenings en
tertainment was the recreative
part which was simply beyond
description. " Shorty" Hull took
the prize as a sure shot at the
mouth-trap, while many others
excelled at various stunts. The
party broke up in the wee sma'
hours after singing Auld Lane
Syne. Altogether it was a
social event any community
might be proud of.
Loucks- Gould
Jim Gould, one of the promi
nent farmers of the Headlight
section, and Mrs. Alice N.
Loucks were quietly married at
the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ed
Hughes Sunday by Rev. Alex
ander Pringle. Mrs. Gould is a
niece of Harry Wilkins and has
resided at the Wilkins ranch
for the past two years. The Pi
oneer Press joins their many
friends in wishing the happy
couple a long, joyful and pros
perous wedded life.

Fake Rural
Credit Schemes
• The department has recently
received letters from a number
of farmers who have subscribed
for stock in rural credit com
panies, including so-called co
operative companies, which ap
pear to have no real cooperativ e
features.
In some of these letters the
-Jomplaint is made that the
agents selling the stock make
nisrepresentations as to when
.oans may be obtained by sub
scribers and that the companies
<ater disclaim responsibility for
seatements made by the agents.
I.i a number of instances, farm
ers seem to have gained the
dea from the agent that they
Arould be able to secure loans
•vithin a relatively short time,
and express disappointment on
eal.z.ng that they must wait
for an indefinite period lor the
promised loan and go on mak
ing payments just the same on
the stock which they have
agreed to take.
Where farmers are confronted
with a proposition of this char
acter they should first read the
prospectus and the contract
very carefullv and make sure
hat they know exactly what
these mean, especially the con
tract. If the contract is so
worded that its meaning is not
clear after a careful reading,
this in itself should be reason
enough for extra caution. The
agenf#explanation of the con
tract is not a part of the con
tract, nor is his promise that
the company will do things not
specified in the contract by any
means sure to be recognized by
the company.
Farmers ought, first, to find
out what provision has been
made for the protection of the
interests of subscribers, either
chrough responsible government
supervision over the activities
of the company, or in any other
way, and if they are in doubt
they should consult competent
advisors with regard to the
responsibility of the company
before paying over, or agreeing
to pay over, their own good
money. Always in the matter
of subscription to stock in any
.und of a company, they should
exercise caution.— F. S. Cooley.

The town of Fowler can lay
claim to the honor of being
about the lirst town in the
state to go dry, the said drying
up process occurring this v eek
when the liquid stock of Jacob
iiraft was seized under attach
ment Constable L. J. Hens
ier, and tne thirst emporium
went out of business. Jacob
lias been having some difficulty
in making the county commis
sioners believe that he was
conducting a hotel in connec
tion with his bar that just came
up to the plans and specilica
tions for such a hostlery as pro
vided by the state law. But
anyway, pending a settlement
of this dispute, it is said that
Jacob continued to dispense
wet goods to such of his thirsty
neighbors as could raise the
pi ice. Jacob's creditors, how
ever, did not think his chances
for success were very good,
so they settled the dispute by
taking over the stock.—-Conrad

Bank Organized
at Browning
The First National Bank of
Browning has been organized
with a capital stock of $25,000
and will probably open for bus
iness about the first of June.
J. H. Sherburne of Browning is
president of the institution and
M. H. Worden of this city has
been selected as cashier. The
stock-holders are Browning and
Cut Bank people and John S.
Tucker, president of the Far
mers State Bank, is also inter
ested. A building is being
erected at the Agency city for
the bank,
This is the pioneer enterprise
of its kind on the reservation
and will be a great convenience
to people who have their resi
dence or business interests at
Browning. The officers are men
of sterling integrity and bus
iness men of long experience
and this bank will stand as one
of the best institutions of its
size in the state.
Good Roads Wanted
James Perrine was in town
Tuesday. Jim is wearing a pair
of beautiful black eyes as the
result of an auto trip to Choteau
last week. It seems that the
car struck a culvert that was
several inches higher than the
roadway. As the machine was
going about forty miles an hour
Mr. Perrine and the other occu
pants started heavenward, but
were moat rudely interrupted
and returned to earth by the
bows of the top, which was
raised at the time. The party
was on its way from Browning
to the coun ty *^at to attend a
good roads meeting, and the
dilapidated appearance of its
members upon their arrival was
a very potent argument in favor
of the movement.
Play at Browning
The Browning Dramatic Club
will present a home talent play
at the Browning hall on Friday
evening; May 5. The play to
oe presented is "Mr. Bob," a
clever two-act comedy. The
play will be followed by a so
cial dance. A good play, a good
dance, good music and a general
good Lime is assured every one.
The people of Cut Bank are
cordially invited to attend.
