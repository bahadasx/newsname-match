PUBLIC UTILITIES
COMMISSION COMES
Spend Whole Day in Salmon in

Taken Up.
I'he Utilities Comm la*loners of the
state of Idaho, Alex P. Ranmtedt
John W Graham and A L. Freeh af
er, came to Salmon last Sunday uiiht
to hear complaints that had been
made to them about the train service
of the Gilmore and Pittsburg rail
road and to see for thtmeelves just
whai tills train service Is.
The day Sunday was «pent on a trip
over the Gilmore branch and late in
the evening tiie party arrived here.
A special train was fur dshed by the
railroad officials, who came along to
See that tue Commissioners suffered
no unnecessary discomfort and dan

I Gil core and Pittsburg officials who
were General Manager O. P. Johnson
and Suprrintendent W. N. Rickler.
I he special passenger cars were kept
here till Tuesday morning when they
were coupler! to the regular train and
I bore the visitors forth, tints affording
them the whole (lay Monday to look
1 up matters affecting the welfare and
I progress of Salmon and which liar]
I been brought to their attention
Primarily it was the running of
the trains that the t nm misst on came
to see about. The complaint charged
that excessive fares were exacted,
passengers being taxed up mileage
beyond I heir destination and starting
station; poor accmodatlons and lack
of safety for travelers; dilapidated
fences that allowed stock to range at
will on the right of way to the delay
of trains as well as to imperil trav
elers dilapidate'! and Insanitary cars:
I luck of facilities for the watering of

I mote I hat the schedules were so ar
ranged as lo afford nothing l*ke pub

so-called dally service for Gilmore,
between that place and Salmon it re

-'saion to raw-hide Uie mayor ot Poc
atello for vetoing a similar ordinance
and the governor of tills state of Ida
ho for countenancing and i»,t veto
ing stare-wide prohibition.
The council was divided like tilt» :
For Sunday movies Bellamy, Bun
dy, fiaug.
Against Sunday movies— LaMun
yan, Mtnerl, Watkins.
It w is noticeable that two of Uie
vote- cast against the measure were
those of cotincilioen who ihemaeive«
itad signed for the so-called .'Sunday
shows, and who had tiie necessary
amount of courage to right a wrong
even tliough they Uiemsevies »-ad
committed it. The adverse vote of
Mlnert, who is a Salmon pioneer and
a kindly man as any pion- er ever *a*.
brought fo tii applause that even the
igorous rapping of tiie mayor's gavel
could m,. repress. The announced
vote of Lx Mui.yan, who held a 8i m
lar poettt ou as that of Mlnert, w»«i
applauded only a little less. These
two were the heroes of the Sur.dav
m vie tight it. Salm.m, while Wat»
kins, the councilman who s o d with
Mlnert and LaMunyan. was be first
to iudiacate the stand tiie three took
against Sunday shows.
Meanwhile the uiatory of tiie may
