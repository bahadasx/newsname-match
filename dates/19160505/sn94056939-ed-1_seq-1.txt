NEW MEXICO SHEEP AND
WOOL FAMOUS
Wlicn the Spanish conqucrnrF
first visited Now Moxlco they round
Indiana fanning the dry land
Farming, nliliniiuli hundreds of
years o'd In the state, In reolily did
not start till about 1000. wlion
general movement resulted in trio
roclamatiuii o I' millions nf acres of
land. Dry farming, upon which a
grout part of the stuto depends, lias
heen proven wholly prnfiloblo in
tlin eastern part of I ho state where
an abundanco and varlty of grain
and feed crops are grown by Bottlers.
Dry farming, of conree is curried
nn most successfully In tho region
of greatest mi ti fall. Tills Is In the
eastern and northeastern parts of
the Mate.
Stock raising, in many counties
remains tho lending pursuit, million
of cattle and sheep being grassed
for tho market. Tho mild winters
and tho cool nights of summer keep
livestock In fino condition. There
is a notable absence of flies and
other bothersome Insects, which
mako life misorublo for cattle In
many other districts.
Tho chief grass depended on by
stockmen is grama grass, a peculiar
growth common to tho Great Plains
and allied to mesquito and other
pralrio grasses. During the ruins
of Juno and July this grass will
grow to a height of ton or twelve
inches. It will support cattle at
tho rato or n steer to about ten or
twelve acres in a normal season
although It Is safer to figuro fifteen
acres to a steer for tho year, In
tho fall grama grass cures where It
grows and furnishes n nutritious
hay which lasts throughout winter
If ranchers do not overcrowd tho
pestures, live stock will look as
well In spring as in tho summer
There ara thousands of springs
throughout the stock country fur
nishing water for II vo stock and
adding greatly to the valuo uf the
land as a live stock region By
leasing public lands surrounding
their water supply at a small ren
tal or by utilizing It free of charge,
tho cost of production of beef is
reduced to merely herding or mar
ketlng,
Tho tdit'p and wool industry of
Now Mexico has long been famous.
There are 4,700,01)0 head of sheep
in the state, yielding moro than
10,000,000 pounds uf wool Goals
are also raised In many parts of
tho stato. Bheep graze over mil
lions of acres in the eastern par
tlon.
The long horn steer of Spanish
origin has gradually been replaced
with tho Horofurd type of beef
steer. The animals aro bred and
roared on tho ranches and are then
shipped off to northern farms where
they are fattened on corn, kafir,
silage and alfalfa hay.
Hardy horses are raised by the
ranchmen which aro of greatest
service throughout tho land.
An 'idea of tho productivity of
tho Pecos Valley, which begins In
Sun Miguel and Guadalupo Coun
ties, may bo gained from the
records which show Hint 0,000 cars
of alfalfa, 1,000 cars of apples, 100
cars of cantaloupes, 100 cars of
tomatoes, fifty cars of canned
tomatoes, Iwonly enrs of cotton
twenty two earn of onions, fifteen
oars of honey, 1,000 cars of cuttle,
2.500,000 pounds nf wool were
shipped I sat year. Under irriga
tlon swcot potatoes yielded .'100
bushels u acrit
Aloro ilian one million acres or
almost twico the area undor irriga
tlon have beon under dry farming
methods by settlers in New Mexico
Wholo counties have been settled
and scores of towns and villages
havo sprung up us a result of sue
refsful dry farming. Selection of
drouth resisting crops has made
possible tho raising of large quantl
ties of grain nnd feed. Scientific
methods combined with dairying
ellos nnd poultry production have
made u practical combination for
settlers on dry land farms. Farm
era who stuck to those crops which
have been recommended by tho
stato experiment stations and gov
eminent investigators have iuvurl
ably succeeded on dry land farms
The rain which comes during tin
growinc season of June, July and
August, is tiiubhy HUfhciont to

ly&st year was an unusual year
for tho southwest . The rainfall was

as a result there woio good crops
of kafir, niilo, foterltu, corn, and in
some Instances there were tro
mcuduus crops of kafir, nillo, ulfal
fa, The writer saw black hulled
while kafir yields of fifty to sixty
bushels an aero under ordinary cul
tivatinn. Mita at tho Tucumcari
Field Station yielded from forty
to sixty bushels an aire. Sudan
grass produced from thrco to four
tons of excellent hay an acre
Sorghum for hay yielded as high as
six tons an ncre Futerita, which
usually makes a good grain growth
with fair rainfall, last year out
yielded its previous high records of
fifty bushels an aero. Feed every
where throughout the I'liuhandlo of
Texas, Oklahoma nnd tho eastern
plains and valley of Now Mexico
was plentiful. Thousands of cuttle
were fed during tha winter, Pros
