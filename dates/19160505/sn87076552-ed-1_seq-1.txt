WILLIAM H. SOHN.
William Henry Sohn departed this
life Thursday morning, April 27, 191(5,
at two tnirty o'clock, aged sixty-four
years, nine months and twenty-nine
uays. Mr. Sohn had been taken seri
ously ill the week following the death
of his wite on March 22, 1915, and
had been an invalid ever since. For
the last three months he was confined
to his bed. The cause was tubercular
trouble.
Mr. Sohn was the son of the late
William and Caroline Swander Sohn
and was born in Tiffin, Ohio. June 29,
It 61. lie was the second of a family
of seven brothers and sisters, the
others of whom were John F. Sohn,
Mrs. Elizabeth E. Hart, Mrs. Sarah
.fittineer. Miss Caroline M. Sohn.
the late Edward M. Sohn and Joseph
B. Sohn. all of Tiffin. His bovhood
and the first few years of his manhood
were spent in Tiffin, where he Lucame
apprenticed to the trade of a marble
and granite cutter. His first business
venture, however was at Wauseon, to
which he came in the summer of 1877.
after having purchased the marble
nd granite business of Edward
Springer. Mr. Sohn continued in this
busintas until 1892, when he sold it
because of ill health. The following
year, however, he purchased the town's
two furnitu.e stores, and, combining
the business of each, engaged in the
lurniture and undertaking business in
the old Scott opera house building. He
continued in the funiture business un
til 1899, when he sold it to devote his
time to investments outside of Wau-
n. In this manner Mr. Sohn was
engaged for three years and spent
part of 1901 and 1902 with his family
in Clinton, Iowa, where he was presi
dent of an independent telephone
plant In 1902, however, he again
purchased the marble and granite
business, which he had formerly own
ed and thus devoted his time until
1905, when he sold the business to
granite shop in Toledo, later becom
ing interested in the Sherman street
Monumental Works in the same city.
Late in 1909 Mr. Sohn sold his busi
ness interests in Toledo and did not
again actively engage in business un
til July, 1911. when he started the un
dertaking business in which he was
engaged at the time of his death.
One of Mr. Bonn's most pronounced
traits was his love of artistic designs
n building 'and the desire himself to
plan them. In no way did he more
enjoy his leisure moments than in
planning or reconstructing a home or
building in imagination. Had he been
jo educated he would probably have
made a successful architect. In part
this hobby did find expression in his
hesen trado... And it also led him to
take an initiative in several public
ouiiding projects. He was chairman
of the building committee of the old
no'i mal school and was a member of
the buildinz committee of the new
Congregational church. He later serv
ed in a similar capacity in the build-
in e of the Wauseon Public Library, ot
which he was a trustee, and at the time
of his death, president of the board.
He was also one of the early officers
of the ill fated Northwestern Ohio
fair association that constructed the
old fair grounds on Ottokee street
and was one of the promoters of Wau-
seon's nrst street lair, moreover, un
til his health failed he was treasurer
of the Fulton County Soldier's and
Sailor's Memorial Monumental Asso
ciation. .
Mr. Sohn had been a Knight of Py
thias for nearly forty-five years. He
was a charter member both or limn
lodere No. 80 and of Wauseon lodge
No. 156. He was likewise a member
of Wauseon lodee No. 349 F. and A
M. and of the G. A. R. Associates. For
manv vears he was a trustee and trea
surer of the Fulton County Building
Loan and Savings Association and he
served several terms as a member of
the villasre council.
On October 7." 1880. Mr. Sohn was
united in marriage to Harriett Amelia
Brigham, daughter of the late Joel and
Betsy Lyon Brigham. Mr And Mrs.
Sohn immediately began house keep
ing in the home on East Elm street
which they had planned together and
where they both died. To them were
born three sons, twins, who died in in
fancy, and Howard Brigham bohn,
who survives his parents.
Funeral services were held at the
home on East Elm street Saturday
forenoon at 10 o'clock conducted by
Rev. W. C. Schafer pastor of the Con
gregational church assisted by. Rev.
F. E. Kenyon.
Mrs. R. a. Darby with Mrs. .an
Ed car as accompanist saner with feel
ins "No Nieht There" by DanUs and
"Morning Noon and Night" by Bond.
Interment was made in wauseon
cemetery by the side of Mrs. Sohn
who died a little more than a year ago.
The services were largely attended by
the business associates, friends and
neighbors of Mr. Sohn.
Among those present from out of
town were Mrs. A. M. Hart, Miss
Lina Sohn, Mrs. I. J. Mathias and F.
M. Pittmeer of Tiffin; Mr. Arthur
Lyon, of Ligionier, Indiana, and Miss
Margaret Bixler, of Lyons.

Dy Mrs. Kachel Tedrow four miles
northwest of Wauseon, narrowly es
caped death by drowning last Satur
day afternoon.
The drain for the cellar of the
house on the Tedrow farm had become
stopped up and in consequence there
was about two feet of water stand
ing in the cellar.
On Saturday afternoon Mr. and
Mrs. Mixter were preparing to go to
Wauseon; Mr.. Mixter had gone to the
cellarway for his razor and uninten
tionally left the door unlatched. , A
passing neighbor called from the road
and both Mr. and Mrs. Mixter step
ped to the door of their home to talk
with their friend leaving their two
children, Jeanette aged two and one
half years and Louise aged eleven
months in the room alone. The young
er of the children crept to the cellar
door and finding it ajar pulled it open
and passing through the door fell
down jthe cellar stairs and into the
water. -;
The sreeames of Jeanette, the older
child brought the parents into the
room where they discovered that the
baby was missing; search about the
house failed to reveal the whereabouts
of the child until Mrs. Mixter noticing
the open cellar door ran down the
stairs and reaching into the water at
the foot of the stairs found the body
of her' baby. Mrs. Mixter immediate
ly held her child hy the feet head
downwards, permitting the water to
run from out the lungs. Dr. W. H.
Maddox responded promptly to a
hurry, call sent over the phone and
r-estoratftre .treatments administered
by the mother and doctor saved the
little life from being snuffed out. We
imagine .that the time . and trouble
of taking up and cleaning out that cel

"BUSINESS IS BUSINESS."
By Burton Braley.
"Business is business," but men are
men,
Loving and working, dreaming,
Toiling with pencil or spade or men,
Roistering, planning, scheming.
"Business is business" but he's a fool
Whose business has grown to
smother
His faith in men and the golden rule,
His love for a friend and brother.
"Business is business" but life is life
Though we're all in the game to
win it,
Let's rest sometimes from the heat
and strife.
And try to be friends a minute.
Let's seek to be comrades now and
then,
And slip from .our golden tether:
"Business is business," but men are
men,
And we're all good pals together.

Avoid Spring Colds.
Sudden changes, high winds, shift
ing seasons cause colds and grippe,
and these spring colds are annoying
and dangerous and are likely to turn
into a chronic summer cough. In such
cases take a treatment of Dr. King's
New Discovery, a pleasant Laxative
Tar Syrup. It soothes the cough,
checks the cold and helps break up
an attack of grippe. Its already pre
pared, no mixing or fussing. Just
ask your druggist for a bottle of Dr.
King's New Discovery. Tested and
tried for over 40 years.

VARNISHES
l We recommend these
varnishes because we know
that they give best results.
They outwear all ordinary
varnishes ; soap and water
will not harm them
whether the water be hot
or cold.
"Little Blue Flag" Var
nishes can be depended
upon ; don't take chances
with brands of unknown
merit, for the quality and
value of varnish tell in the
final results. Let us show
you samples and estimate
your requirements.
