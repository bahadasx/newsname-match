Maintaining Earth Roads
Dratnage of Prime Importance-Drag Should
Not Be Used on a Dry Road-How
to Operate Road Drag
(Prepared by the U. S. Department of Agriculture)
! HaýýýýýrrTr2nhý?Fa
The first and last commandment in
earth road maintenance is to keep the
road well drained. To insure good
drainage the ditches should be kept
open, all obstructions removed and
a smooth crown maintained. Side
:litches of ample capacity should be
maintained with sufficient fall to dis
pose of surface water. These ditches
in most places can be constructed and
repaired with a road machine. The
road machine or grader may in gen
eral be used effectively for this work.
The machine should be used when tile
soil is damp so that it will pack and
bake into a hard crust.
All vegetable matter, such as sods
and weeds, should be kept out of the
road, as they make a spongy surface
which retains moisture. Clods are
also objectionable for they soon turn
Ito dust or mud. Bow ders or loose
stones are equally objectionable if a
smooth surface is to be obtained.
A split-log drag or some similar de
vice is very useful in maintaining the
surface after suitable ditches and
cross-sections have once been con
structed. This drag can also be
used to advantage on most gravel
roads as well as on earth road. The
principle involved in dragging is that
clays and most heavy soils will puddle
if worked when wet and set very hard
when dry. The little attention that
the earth road needs must be given
promptly, therefore, and at the prop
er time if the best results are to be
obtained.
In dragging roads only a small
amount of earth is moved, just enough
to fill the ruts and depressions with
a thin layer of plastic clay or earth

which packs very hard so that the
next rain, instead of finding ruts and
depressions in which to collect, runs
off, leaving the surface but little af
fected.
Using the Drag.
The drag should be light and should
be drawn over the road at an angle of
about 45 degrees. The driver should
ride on the drag and should not drive
faster than a walk. One or two round
trips, the first straddling the wheel
tracks, is usually sumcient to fill the
ruts and smooth the surface. If neces
sary, the road should be dragged after
every bad spet of weather, when the
soil is in proper condition to puddle
well and still not adhere to the drag.
If the road is very bad it may be
dragged when very wet and again
when it begins to dry out. A few trips
over the road will give the operator
an idea as to the best time to drag.
Drag at all seasons but do not drag
a dry road.
The side slope or crown of an
earth road should be about one inch
to the foot. If the crown becomes too
high it may be reduced by dragging
toward the ditch instead of from it.
If the drag cuts too much, the hitch
should be shortened and the driver
should owansge his position on the drag.
If it is eecessary to protect the face
of the drag with a strip of iron, it
should be placed flush with the edge
of the drag and not projecting. A
cutting edge should be avoided as the
main object of the drag is to move but
a small amount of the damp soil which
is smeared over the surface of the
road.
BEAUTY OF OUR STATE ROADS
Plan of Planting Shade Trees Along
Roadside Is Good One-Decision
of Maryland Court,
The decision of the court of appeals
sustaining the validity of the law
which confers upon the state board of
forestry regulative power and author
Ity in the matter of planting or cutting
and pruning trees along the state high
ways, is of potential importance in
connection with the latest proposal
to improve the side lines of the state
roads by the planting of forest or fruit
trees. The state road law apparently,
in the original draft, contemplated
such a scheme of improvement, says
Baltimore American. While the plant
ing of shade trees is not made a man
datory duty on the state road
commission, there is a clause in the
law that opens the way for such a
plan of beautification.
The state forestry board would per
haps be the agency through which
such a plan could be best realized.
The activities of the annual arbor
days have not been largely resultful in
the matter of roadside tree planting.
Such a scheme can only be brought
to realization through systematic and
persistently maintained effort. But
the idea is a good one and should be
brought to realization even though it
is necessary for the state to invest
some money in the undertaking. Noth
ing would more conduce to the beau
tification of rural neighborhoods than
the lining of the highways with shade
trees.
STATE TO MAINTAIN ROADS
Amount Exceeding $160,000,000 Ex
pended Annually for Construction
and Care of Highways.
The realization has become quite
general that, in order to render maxi
mum service, state highway depart
ments should be given some measure
of control over the construction and
maintenance of local roads. For this
class of roads an amount exceeding
$16,000,000 is expended annually, with
comparatively little result to show in
the form of improved road mileage for
this great outlay. The state of Iowa
has met this situation by placing all
the road work in the state under the
direction of the state highway depart
ment.
Traffic is increasing so rapidly as to
cause excessive wear upon the roads,
especially in the vicinity of congested
centers of population. This results
in a heavy annual maintenance cost.
averaging in the large Eastern states
not less than $750 per mile per annum.
Many experiments have been made
in the effort to devise types of road
which can be maintained at relatively
low cost. Thus far, aside from the
cheaper forms of construction, the
states are depending upon the various
forms of bituminous macadam, con
orete and vitrified brick road.
