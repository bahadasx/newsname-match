Germany Admits Rhht of Search
and Seizure
ALLIES MUST CHANGE METHODS
Otherwise Germany Will Revoke Con
cessions and Return to Original
Plan of Submarine Warfare.
Berlin, May 5. The German, note to
America acquiesces in the contention
of the right of search and seizure o
both freight and passenger vessels,
but it urges upon the Uuited States
the necessity of insisting that Great
Britain change her Illegal methods of
warfare. i
In case the United States is unable
to bring about any change of method
on the part of Great Britain then Ger
many will be forced to return to her
original tactics in submarine warfare.
The concessions are made not only
In the Interests of humanity, but be
cause of the longstanding friendship
with the United States.
The note admits the possibility that
the unknown channel steamer sunk
by a submarine was the Sussex, but
pleads that the sinking of that vessel
was due to error.
The note Ironically calls attention
to the fact that while the United
States Is only protecting against the
illegal acts of Great Britain and the
allies the American government is
threatening Germany.
Washington, May 4. Secretary
Lansing announced late today that a
dispatch from Ambassador Gerard
contained Indications of what the am
bassador believed would constitute
Germany's reply to the American note
on submarine warfare.
Secretary Lansing declined to make
public the dispatch or any part of its
contents or to say what the indications
were, but in spite of his refusal to dis
cuss the dispatch It became known
late today that In view of Buch infor
mation as has been received, officials
of the government fear Germany has
attached conditions to its reply that
may made it impossible for the United
StateB to continue diplomatic rela
tions.
Berlin, via London, May 4. Official
announcement was made tonight that
German reply to the latest Ameri
can note on the submarine Issue be
tween the two governments will be
made nubile at 8 o'clock tomorrow
morning, Berlin time.
The note will be made public in
both the original German and an of
ficial English translation. This tran
elation comprises some 15,000 words
It will be sent to the United States, by
wireless, for publication there, im
mediately after it is given out. It is
roughly estimated that the transmls
sion of so lengthy a document by the
present wireless facilities will take
from eighteen to twenty-four hours.
No Inkling of the contents of the
note has been allowed to become
public here. The only basis for prop
hecies regarding the nature of the
answer is the answer's length. It is
argued as unlikely that a note of 15,
000 words sent from one government
to another is either an absolute refusal
of that other government's demands or
a complete acquiescence in them. It
is presumed because of its length that
the note discusses the situation and
perhaps specific cases of alleged viola
tions of international law by German
submarines in detail.
The German reply was handed to
Ambassador Gerard at the foreign of
flee by Dr. von Jagow, the foreign
minister at 5.35 o'clock yesterday at
ternoon.
intense anxiety prevailed here
throughout the day with regard to the
effect which concessions may have up
on the great masses of the people.
The American ambassador called at
the foreign office at 5.35 o'clock.
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg,
Admiral von Holtzendorff, chief of the
naval general staff, and Dr. Karl Helf-
ferlch, secretary of the treasury, re
turned to Berlin yesterday from army
headquarters in the west where they
had extended conferences with the
Kaiser in connection with the German
reply to President Wilson's note.
Tho Berlin stock market showed
new optimism shortly before closing
yesterday afternoon when It was
learned that the note was to bo dis
patched to Washington.
Tho imperial chancellor is expected
to address tho budget committee with
in a few days on the German reply.

BRITISH ARREST
j. in. mmw
Tammany Leader Ac'used of Com
plicity in Revolt
EX-MMSTERTO SANTO D3MING0
Had Been in Ireland Since Leaving
Santo Domingo Following an
Investigation.
London, May 5. James M. Sullivan
of New York, formerly American
minister to Santo Domingo, has been
arrested in Dublin on the charge of
complicity in the Irish rebellion. Mr.
Sullivan was arrested by the military
authorities of Dublin on April 30.
"Mrs. Sullivan, who was with her
husband, wrote on May 1 a letter
which has just been received by Wal
ter liines Page, the American embas
sador, who addressed a note to Sir
Edward Grey, the foreign secretary,
asking full information as to whether
Mr. Sullivan was still in custody, tho
nature of the charges and how soon
he would be tried.
'It is understood here that Mr. Sul
livan has been in Ireland for a con
slderable time, having arrived there
soon after the severance of his con
nectlon with the state department."
Mr. Sullivan sailed for Ireland last
July two weeks before he was virtual
ly asked to resign his post as United
States minister to Santo Domingo. He
expected to return last September, lie
said, but did not come back. Sullivan
Is Irish by birth. He whs born In Kll
larney on January 6, 1873, and came to
this country when a boy. He was
brought up In Brooklyn. Later he
went to Yale university and took up
the profession of law, first practicing
in Connecticut and then going to New
York city. He was counsel for "Bald
Jack" Ro?e In the Rosenthal murder
case and later for political services,
was appointed to the post in Santo
Domingo.
A few weeks after taking office Sul
llvan was accused of favoring certain
of his relatives in contracts. J
J. Franklin Fort, at the request of
President Wilson, visited Santo Do
mingo and made a report on the situ
ation, in which he said he believed
the charges to be unfounded. Later,
however, the charges took on a more
serious turn, and Sullivan resigned his
post two weeks before a subsequent
report was to bo made by Senator
Phelan of California He then return
ed to this country, and almost im
mediately sailed for Ireland.

Understood that Punitive Expedition
Will Not Make Further Progress
Into Mexico.
El Paso, Tex., May 5. Although
there was. no, formal announcement of
the action notification that the Scott
Obregou agreement- is acceptable , to
the American government was tele
graphed to Gen Scott here late yes
terday by Secretary Baker. Gen.
Scott Is authorized to exchange formal
acceptances with Gen. Oltregon us
soon as the latter has obtained the
approval of Gen. Carranza und olllciuls
at Washington are confident that will
bo today or tomorrow.
President Wilson issued this state
ment: "I have examined, with the sec
retary of war, the report made by Gen.
Hugh L. Scott of the conference be
tween him and Gen. Obrego, secretary
of war of the republic of Mexico. The
report includes a tentative agreement
covering tho future operations of botli
the American and Mexican military
forces and evidences cordial co-operation
between the two governments in
their common purpose.
"As this agreement is being sub
mitted to the de facto government of
Mexico it would not be proper for me
to permit its publication until thut
government lias had an opportunit;- to
examine and consider its provisions.
The full text of the proposed agree
ment will be given out immediately
upon its acceptance by both govern
ments. In general. I may- say that It
provides a basis of co-operation which
promises to prevent misunderstanding
and strengthens the cordial relations
of the two republics."
The limitations of" tho expedition
under the agreement have not been
disclosed. It is understood, however,
that it will hold the present lines for
the time being and not proceed to the
south in any event. The best infor
mation at the war department as to
the present location of the American
forces shows that Gen. Pershing is
at Nimiqulpa, but that patrols are at
work to the south of that place pur
suing scattered bands of outlaws. Gen
Pershing's reports have acknowledg
ed that the great majority of his com
mand was inactive pending the out
come of the El Paso conference.

OCATIGN WILL BE ABANDONED
Overflowing of Adjoining Land Be
lieved to Have Been Cause of
Trcuble.
It has been found necessary to aban
don the "Puck pond" in Arlington as
source of water supply for one of
the proposed sub hatchery stations
Inch Stato Fish and Game ommis-
ioner John W. Titcomb is planning to
establish at different points in the
state. The warm weather of Satur
day and Sunday raised the tempera
ture of the water to such an extent
and there has been so much mortality
mong the trout fry in tho troughs
that the commissioner decided to dis
tribute the young fish in the streams
s quickly as possible and "break
camp at the Duck ponu.
The news of the failure of the
Duck, pond" to meet expectations will
be received with genuine regret by
portsmen in this vicinity, for until
the arrival of warm weather the re
ports from the experimental hatchery
had been exceptionally encouraging.
While no thorough investigation has
ct been made at the pond, it is the
general belief thut the water from the
prings Is as good as any that can be
found in the state. During the cold
weather of last winter the tempera
ture seldom varied more than,' one or
two degrees and the quantity met all
requirements.
The failure in the test Is believed
to have been due to the raising of
the pond above its natural level.
Overflowing of surrounding land
which was covered with vegetation Is
believed to have contaminated the
water sufficiently to make it uninhabit
able by young fry. Tho land is so low
that it was impossible to obtain a suf
ficient head to flow the water to the
necessary height for the troughs
without raising the level of the pond
and a dam was erected at the outlet.
It will now be necessary to locate
some other site for the tub-station
from which to supply tho trout waters
In the southwestern section of the
state.

LAW'S TDltS;
Edward Slocum Is Charged With
Theft of Jewelry
CLEVER WORK BY CHIEF BR5ZIL
Had Been Roller Skating on Street3
For Harte Theatre Caught in
North Bennington in Getaway.
i Quick work on tho part of Chief
Patrick Brazil succeeded in preventing
Edward Slocum from departing- for
parts unknown' Thursday afternoon
with jeweln, ytdleged to belong to Mrs.
Charles Palmer of Park street.
, Slocum is the young man who for tho
past few days has been performing on
Bennington -streets on roller skates in
make-up, advertising the Ilarte thea.
tcr. He had been boarding at the
American house and also visiting his
aunt, Mrs. Charles Palmer.
Tho capture wii3 made in North Ben
nington while Slocum was awaiting a
train to take him to , Rutland. Mr.
Palmer, returning home between four
and five o'clock Thursday afternoon,
discovered the house had been broken
into and rifled and notified Chief
Brazil.
Chief Brazil went to the American
house w here Slocum had been staying
and found that Slocum had paid his
bill there a few minutes before and
left, saying he was to take the next
trolley . for North Adams. Phone
warning to look out for the man was
sent to the North Adams police and
lso the station in North Bennington.
In a few minutes the station agent at
the latter place reported that a man
answering Slocum's description - had
just alighted from the trolley car and
was apparently waiting for someone in
the station Chief Brazil took the next
trolley for North Bennington and by
circling around the buildhr.; instead of
coming straight up th? hill where his
men could see him, succeeded in bag-
gins Slocum as he was leaving by the.
econd door from the station waiting
rofm.
Slocum. who styled himself "Dare
Devil Jack, the champion roller-skater
of the world", is also charged with ap-
uopriating two revolvers in addition
to the jewelry, one of which was dis-
overed on him at the time he was
ai;en. At first bloeuni protested Ms
guilt but the name "Dare-Devil Jack"
on the end or his suitcase gave him
away and he accompanied Chief Brazil
back without any trouble.
Officer Hurley afterward investigat
ed the contents of his suitcase and
filled a good-sized 'box with the loot
which Slocum is charged with taking
from his relative's home. The young
man was given lodging ur.der the clock
'or the night and a hearing was held
this afternoon in Judge llolden's of
fice which had not been concluded at
a Into hour this afternoon.
