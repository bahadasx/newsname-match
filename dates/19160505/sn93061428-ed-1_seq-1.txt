DOOM OF TREASON.
Prim Minister Announce to Houm
of CMnmotw That Principals In R
Mlion in Ireland Had Been Prompt
1 Court Martialed and Eaeeuted.
I SIR AUGUSTINE BIRRELL
"4 RESIGNS FROM CABINET.
Admita Hi Error aa Chief Secretary
for Emerald Isle in Underestimat
ing Sinn Fein Movement! aa Private
Member Will Debate Revolt.
London, May 8. The announcement
In the hous of eommnna today by the
prima mlnUter that the leadera in the
rebellion in Ireland had been court
martialed and summarily executed,
created profound feeling, although
this action by the government was ex
pected. Premier Aiqulth at th tarn tima
announced that Sir Roger Casement,
who waa on of the prima moverá in
the uprising and who now la a prison
er in the Tower of London, would be
tried with the utmost expedition.
Augustine Birrell mad a brief
statement and admitted his error as
chief secretary for Ireland, in under
estimating the Sinn Fein movement
adding tht when h was informed
that the Insurrection had been put
down ha had tendered hia resignation
to th prim minister and that it had
been accepted.
John Redmond, leader of the Iri
parliamentary party, begged th gov
ernment U be lenient win, th great
mass of tiios Involved in th revolt
and said he waa party to blame for
Mr. Birrell's earlier complacency re
specting condition In Ireland, a he
had concurred in th secretary's
view that th danger of an outbreak
vik not a real one.
Laurence Ginnell, member of the
north division of West Meath, who is
classed aa a nationalist, but followed
the leadership of no particular party,
greeted the announcement of the pre
mier that some of the leadera of the
Irish rebellion had been shot with the
cry of "nuns". For som minutes he
prevented Mr. Birred from making a
statement and gave notice that he
would move a resolution calling at
tention to Che shooting of "innocent
men by this Hunnish government."
Mr. Birrell, when he got a hearing,
aaid be would have an opportunity as
a private member, of taking part in
the debate on th Irish revolution. He
candidly admitted that he made an
untrue estimate of the Sinn Fein
movement and the possibility of dis
turbances, such aa had occurred in
Dublin, especially in respect to th
mod of warf are which had been pur
sued and the desperate folly displayed
ty the leader and their deputies.
Therefore, at the moment he learned
from Gen. John Maxwell that th in
surrection had been quelled h placed
his resignation in the hands of the
prime minister and it has been ac
cepted. He wished to say to hla
critics that the error which he is ac
credited with waa not due to any lack
of precaution or foresight.
From the outbreak of the war, he
took it to be only hia duty to main
tain unbroken and unimpaired, if pos
sible, the position of Ireland as a
who! to th common foe. In that
hope and aim he had been gallantly
assisted by Mr. Redmond. He thought
of nothing else, wished for nothing
Ise. It had been said In th house,
continued th former secretary, that
Ireland was to be th bright spot in
th empire in the hour of th coun
try's dire necessity. He hoped it
might even yet still be said to be so.
He waa well aware of the difficulties
of the situation and knew Iceland well
enough to know that there was much
which would causa anxiety. He said
th difficulties were great and the ice
thin, but ha considered it to bo his
duty to run great risks In order to
maintain in Ireland herself and in
th fac of Europe a picture of un
broken unanimity within the boundar
ies of soil.
Mr. Birrell said that when he view
ed the smoking ruins of Dublin and
th ruins of his own ambitions, there
was one sad hop in his heart, that
this was no Irish rebellion and that
new bonds of union might be forged.
He hoped that aome measure of good
might com out of this great evil.
Th prim minister, in making not
of Mr. Dirrell's statement, said that
without prejudicing the decision which
might ultimately be taken, he was
sur th bous had heard Mr. Birrell
not without emotion and sympathy
and he assured Mr. Birrell that h
possessed in a peculiar degree th af
fection of all hia colleagues.
Mr. Redmond aaid that tha whole
business in Ireland had been to him
misery and a heartbreak. H paid
warm tribuU to Mr. Birrll. H flt
that h himself had incurred some of
th blam which Mr. Birrell had laid
at his own door.
Patrick Pears, "th provisional
president of Ireland," was about S3

Carlsbad, N. M., May 4. 1010.
Major E. P. Bujac, Carlsbad, N. M.,
Dear Sir:
Aa your bill for electric lighting at
your residence for the past eighteen
months has averaged less than $'.75
per month, and you are paying only
ten cents per kilowatt per month, and
all of our local directors' bills are
much larger per month, and they are
? eying 12 1-2 cents a kilowatt, they
eel that you should pay the aame
rate that they and tha other small
ennaumers pay. Therefore, from Mav
1st, ltUU. you will be charged 12 1-2
cents a kilowatt.
Trusting that you will see the Jus
tice of not making a discrimination
to consumers losing the same quan
tity of service, w remain.
Yours truly,

I BE CAREFUL WITH
I YOUR BALLOT.
1 At former primaries many ballots
I were thrown out on account of crosj
marks after the name of the voter
I wanted to vote for. If you want your
ballot counted scratch the name you
' do not want to vote for, but do not
use the cross mark which is used in
many states and was here in the con
stitutional election, and at the lust
general election when voting on the
constitutional amendments. These
I cross marks confuse the voter who
j should remember that the only way to
i get a vote counted Is to scratch with
! a Dencil the name of the candidate
you do NOT wish to vote for.
