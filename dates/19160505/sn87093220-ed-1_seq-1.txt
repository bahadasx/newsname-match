$200 WAGE
Council Advances Salary

. By $25
MAY BE NO SPLASH
Closed Town Conditions
Cause Contributions
to Be Shy
The city council, at Wednesday
night's session, raised City Engineer
E. D. Kelsey's salary from $175 to
$200 a month, effective only during his
work on the Wishkah water project,
and tabled an ordinance which would
reduce Water Superintendent Lind
strom's salary from $150 to $125.
Mayor J. M. Phillips announced
three appointments of city officers,
A. E. Cross being kept as city attor
ney, Kelsey as city engineer and W.
H. Tamblyn as fire chief. Other ap
pointments, the mayor will make next
Wednesday.
Upon the mayor's' report that the
Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce com
mittee on Splash had resigned and
that President Gaillac of the Cham
ber had asked that the city consider
taking over the Fourth of July cele
bration arrangements, Councilman
John Fraser moved that a committee
be appointed to confer with the
Chamber. No one seconded the mo
tion and no action was taken upon the
Chamber's request.
The Fourth of July committee, James
bowes, (J. A. holmer, klmer Hem
null ana iom ui>in, diaitu me mayor,
iiad quit wo IK because utfaiuess men
leiused to commute to cue splash
lund as long as tne town remained
-closed." beyond Phillips' comment
to the effect that police committee,
chief of police and himself were pret
ty well agreed that no change irom
•tne "closed'' conditions need be ex
pected, there was no discussion upon
uiis point. The council listened to
a denunciation, by P. F. Halterty, of
the gambling with stage money that
was a feature of the recent "Frontier
Days" entertainment staged by the
Knights of Pythias and Truant Officer
Eddy stated that small boys had been
gambling with the surplus phoney
bills after the K. f. show had wound
up.
Crane & Co. were awarded contract
for supplying the water department
with B,uuu teet ot ti-incii castiron pipe.
Chief of folice K. J. Schmidt re
ported that there had been 47 arrests
in April, 18 being for drunkenness,
and mat had been collected in
fees and tines.
Thirty-eight Broadway property own
ers protested at the projected laying
of b-foot concrete sidewalks on botli
sides of that thoroughfare. Resolu
tions were passed providing for sev
eral drainage ditches west of Division
street and for concrete roadway on
M street from Third to Fourth and
for the same with parking strip in
center from Fourth to Bay View ad
dition.
A tie developed in voting for presi
dent of the council for the ensuing
year, Brecht and Grant each getting
five votes. The question of how to
decide the tie was referred to the
city attorney.
AUTOS HELP SOME
Apportionment by the state auditor
of auto license funds from Oct. 1
to April 1 gives Grays Harbor coun
ty a bit more than $7,500 for the gen
eral road maintenance fund.

Tomorrow, at Cosmopolis, will take
place the spring shoot of the Grays
Harbor Trapsliooting association. At
least thirty sharpshooters of the Har

from Tacoma are expected to line up
for the shoot, which will consist of
ten events of 15 birds each, carrying
an entrance fee of $15, or of $1.50
for each event. For low amateurs
under 60 per cent one event of a
10-bird race will be -given, with en

PLENTY OF BIDDERS
City Engineer L. D. Kelsey yester
day took a party of intending bidders
on construction of the Wishkah wa
ter project, over the projected pipe
line. This he will do every Thursday
this month, until the time for open
ing bids on the work, May 31.
A couple of dozen prospective bid
ders are in the field now, and there
seems no doubt that there will be
plenty to choose from.
M. J. Cline, former saloon keeper
of this city, was arrested last Satur
day on charge of having in his pos
session more than the legal amount of
liquor. A raid on his house at 213
North F street, yielded a few dozen
quarts of beer, several bottles of li
quors and cordials and 13 partially
filled demijohns of wine. Cline for
feited $50 bail and the booze was de
stroyed.

THIRST INCREASING? ❖
January: 70 liquor permits.
February: 252 liquor permits.
March: 539 liquor permits.
April: 1015 liquor permits.
This is the record for the first
four months in Grays Harbor
county as shown in the county
auditor's office in Montesano.
In Aberdeen, arrests for drunk
enness last month totalled 18;
arrests for all causes, 47. While
that is an increase over the
March record, it is mighty good
as compared with the record for
April, 1915: 38 arrests for
drunkenness; 78 for all causes.
ALL DANGER OF
STRIKE IN MILLS
HERE NOW OVER
All danger of a strike in shingle
mills seefns now to be over. The
difficulty has been settled on Grays
Harbor, partly by mills granting the
demands of shingle weavers and pack
ers for increase of wage scale to 16
cents for the former and 10 cents for
the latter, the ' scale in effect prior
to the advent of the past few years'
depression, partly by compromises
reached in some cases. In Seattle
the trouble, too, is over, and the Ev
erett situation is assuming better
shape.
APRIL PRETTY DRY
Only 4.5G inches of rain fell in
April, despite the impression of pret
ty constant rains given most citizens
during the month. The rain was in
showers, all of short duration.
Recent arrivals at the Washington
Hotel were W. Harrington and wife,
who were motoring from Seattle to
the beach; J. H. Stetson of the Stet

SEASON COURSE

Sale of tickets for the Redpath
Lyceum Bureau course, to be given
here this summer, will be started
soon, it was decided Monday night
at a meeting of the committee of lo
cal citizens who will handle arrange
ments. W. C. Mumaw was chairman
and A. E. Graham secretary of the
meeting, and it was decided to put
the price of season tickets for adults
at $2; for students, $1; for others
under 18 years, 75 cents. Adults' sin
gle admission will be 75 cents; under
18 years, 35 cents.
Should a surplus accumulate from
the course, it was determined that It
should constitute a fund for a similar
course next year or for any similar
purpose. Thus the undertaking re
mains a community enterprise entire
ly, not a private one.

THE GREATEST LITTLE PEACEMAKER.
Season Opens for
Stripping Bark of
Cascara off Tree
SMALL BOY AND ADULT, TOO,
CAN MAKE GOOD MONEY BY
DAY SPENT IN WOODS
Pealing Time, Which Is Opening Now,
Will Not Close Until Next
August
The delightful weather with which
May is rpening carries an. invitation
to the woods. For the next four
months the small boy can take his
outing Saturday and make good mon
ey peeling cascara bark from the
trees which grow thickly in many
sections of Grays Harbor. There is
good profit, too, for the adult in put
ting in a day at getting cascara bark.
According to a bulletin of the forest
service, a steady demand for this
bark for medicinal purposes, both In
the United States and in Europe, ex
ists. Before the war most of the ex
ported product went to England and
Germany.
The cascara bark industry began,
it is asserted, in California about
1865. The tree from which it is ob
tained is variously known as cascara
chittim, and bearberry.
The peeling season opens in April
ancl closes when the bark begins to
tighten In August. The bark is taken
off the tree ih as long strips as pos
sible, spread on canvas or other ma
terial to keep it off the ground, and
dried in the sun.
Fifteen years ago there was a scarc
ity of bark in the world's markets, and
it brought the settler from ten to
twenty cents a pound, even running
as high as 29 cents. This meant a
good profit for the bark gatherer. For
the past seven years, however, the
price has been from 3% to 6 cents
per pound at Portland ,and as a re
sult the ranchers have lost much of
their interest in bark peeling, and
engage in it onl? when nothing bet
ter is in sight. There are some, how
ever, who are so situated that they
can afford to hold the bark, awaiting
the rise in price which they think
depends upon the war in Europe.
ABERDEEN WINS MEET
Hobi of the Aberdeen high school,
as expected, smashed the county rec
ord for the high jump at the All-
Grays Harbor track meet last Satur
day on Stewart field. He cleared the

34 for Montesano and 9 for Hoquiam.

Dr. Frazee, Sedro-Woolly physician,
is negotiating with the county com
missioners in an effort to get hold of
the county hospital building between
Aberdeen and Hoquiam. He would
lease it from the county, handling
county patients at so much per case,
or hire himself and staff to the coun
ty, retaining the right to handle pri
vate business in the hospital, paying
the county regular fees therefor. That
makes another suggestion for getting
something out of Grays Harbor coun

VOLUME 3
ABERDEEN
PROVES IT
IS GROWING
Figures Show 60 Fami
lies Added in Past
Month
BUSINESS IS BETTER
Shipyards Have All They
Can Do to Handle
Contracts
Aberdeen is growing. Sixty families
were added to the population in the
past month.
Aberdeen business enterprises are
waxing apace. Particularly' is this
true of shipbuilding.
Records of the city water depart
ment for April show that water was
turned on in 87 new homes, as against
28 places where it was shut off. Re
sult: 59 families added to the popu
lation.
Both the Aberdeen shipyards on the
Wishkah and the Grays Harbor ship
yards on the Chehalis are putting
more men on the payroll, as work pro
gresses. That explains a part of the
increase in population in the past few
weeks.
C. M. Weatherwax, on his return a
few days ago from a three months*
visit in California, saw a big change
in conditions here. He ascribes it, la
large part, to the revival of the ship
building industry in Aberdeen. Five
years of continuous prosperity for
Grays Harbor are predicted Qonfident
ly by Weatherwax.
As Weatherwax is Quoted, Andrew
Peterson could be building a dozen
ships at the yards on the Wishkah
instead of the three now on the ways,
if he only had the room. As it is,
Peterson's payroll in a very short
time will be carrying 120 men. A.
Schubach, lessee of the old Lindstrom
yards, figures that within a few weeks
he will have 200 men on and, as soon
as he has room lor tour ships on the
ways, the force will be increased to
300. At the Chris Endresen SpitfF
yards there Is working, on an aver*
age, a force of 30 men. The combin
ed payroll of Aberdeen shipyards, be
fore 1916 is over, will amount to close
to 1600,000 a year. f.
WILL OPEN BIDS w ,
ON HUMPTULIPS
BRIDGE JUNE 5
The county commissioners, June 5,
will open bids for the bridge across
the Humptulips river, at Humptullps.
on the C. D. Hansen road, to cost
about $14,500. It is not expected,
however, that the road will be open
for travel through to Humptulips, be
fore the summer of 1917.
HARTLEY WOULD
USE GOVERNOR'S
CHAIR 4 YEARS
ROLAND H. HARTLEY
Roland H. Hartley, at the Snoho
mish county Republican convention
last week, announced his candidacy
for governor. "I do not wish to ob
tain votes for the governorship," he
said, "under false pretenses. I would
like to have every voter in the state
distinctly understand that if elected
I will serve four years, at whatever
cost necessary, enforce the law with
out discrimination as between capital
and labor. I stand for unfettered en
terprise, business and industry to
grow and expand, unfettered by unin
telligent, dishonest and uneconomic
legislation."
WHALE SEASON ON
The Grays Harbor whaling season
opened last Saturday, three leviathans
of the deep being towed into the Bay
City Station. The Season will end
about the middle of September. The
catch last year was 334 whales.
