Improvements
Under Way
J. P. Reeve Breaks Ground for
New Store Building on
Blanche Street.
Spring's balmy breath, long de
ferred, has at last arrived, and
now that the weather has become
•settled and the cold, blustery
breezes have died away, Beach
echoes with the sound of the ham
mer and saw. Although the pre
sent is clean-up week, it could
properly be termed improvement
-week as well, for it marks an era
-of summer's activity which will
mean much for Beach in a con
structive way.
Probably the most pretentious
building projected at this time is
that of J. P. Reeve, who recently
purchased the lots directly north
of the First National bank. Con
siderable speculation has been
rife since the purchase was made
by Mr. Reeve as to the nature of
the improvements to be erected
thereon, it having been said that
Mr. Reeve, in company with other
parties, contemplated the erect
ion of a moderji hotel.
All speculations were set to
rest when Mr Reeve made known
yhis plans for the erection of a
handsome two-story double-store
^building, 50 foot front and 100
leet in depth. The structure will
be of brick, and will be modern
in every detail. Mr. Reeve cnlem
plates the removel of his meat
market and grocery from his
present location when the build
ing is completed, and will occupy
one of the departments. The
other will be rented. The upper
floor will be divided into office
Tooms. T. G. Plomasen completed
the work of surveying the prem
ises Wednesday and C. J. Raw,
the successful bidder for the ex
cavation work for a nine foot
basement the full size of the
building, commenced work this
afternoon. Over 2,000 yards of
dirt is to be removed, and Mr.
Raw has a large crew at work
"hurrying the excavating along to
make way for the foundation
'work.
Although definite decision has
not been made, present plans of
Sunset Lodge No. 88, A. F. & A.
M., indicate that work will be
started in the near future for the
completion of the Masonic
temple, the excavation work
having in part been made some
years ago. As the committee in
charge does not render a defi
nite report until after the Chron
icle goes to press, we are unable
to stale what action will be tak
fen, but it is understood that a
new home for Ihe Beach Masons
is assured. As planned, the struct
ure will be 34x70 feet, one story,
with high basement, and will be
a handsome structure. It will oc
cupy the corner west of Tom
Smith's residence. For many
years, llie lodge has occupied the
second story of the Kastien (now
Parsons) machine shop, which
answered their needs until with
in the past year or two, when it
•was felt that larger quarters were
necessary The lodge now has a
membership in excess of 100, the
required number for a Chapter,
and in the event that the commit
tee renders a report which will
assure the construction of the
temple, it is understood that a
Chapter will be inaugurated here.
In the past, all Chapter degrees
have been conferred at Dickin
son.
Captain and Mrs. C. A. Near,
-who have been spending the win
ter with relatives at Sioux Falls,
S. D., St. Joseph, Mo., and Min
neapolis, returned Saturday. They
will reside in Beach during the
present summer.
FINE ARTS FEATURE AT
BEACH OPERA HOUSE
Anew Triangle star and an old
favorite are the promotion possi
bilities of striking importance
suggested by the current Griffith
Ince-Sennett releases. First to
mention is Marie Doro, the form
er Charles Frohman star, who is
devoting a year to the new mo
tion picture art. Her services were
acquired by the Triangle for the
Griffith feature, "The Wood
Nymph," a beautiful story of
fantasy, whimsical comedy and
unsual scenic settings. In addi
tion to Miss Doro there is Wil
lard Mack, who has already ap
peared with signal success in pre
vious Triangle star combinations.
Marie Doro has been before
the public for several years in
one way or another. She was an
humble member of a Charles
Frohman musical comedy com
pany when the late manager
lifted her from the ranks and
made her a star in a dramatic
production. Her great beauty
laid the foundation on which her
talent has created a lasting rep
ultation as a sincere and artistic
player. This combination of
beauty and ability finds in the
films a congenial outlet. "The
Wood Nymph" supplies a medi
um that gives ample opportunity
to this favorite player. Miss Doro
an innocent girl who knows
only the methods of the ancient
Greeks in which she has been
trained by a mother with a near
to-nature trend. From her home
in the woods she sallies forth in
search of her Apollo, whom she
expects to find in a tree. She finds
plain Bill Jones, a hunter, who
appears in response to her call
and clapping of hands. Before
their different spheres are recon
ciled and their romance ready
to bud there is a wonderful for
est fire in which mother and
daughter and the members of the
hunting party narrowly escaped
with their lives. All this gives
play for much clean comedy and
superb photography.
Into this combination Griffith
has introduced a distinguished
cast. Frank Campeau, previous
ly seen in "Jordan Is a Hard
Road," has a small but import
ant part. Wilfred Lucas, feat
ured in "The Lily and the Rose,
and soon to be a film star in his
own right, is cast for a role that
requires powerful dramatic act
ing. Charles West is Plain Bill
Jones and Cora Drew the mother.
Incidentally "The Wood Nymplv
presents Miss Doro to the public
for the first time since her own
romance in real life.
It has come to the notice of the
street commissioner that several
•-troperty holders of the city, in
disposing of clean-up week's a&
cumulation of rubbish,haveelevel
ved the simple method of dump
ing them upon the street. In many
instances, broken bottles, bits of
glass and nails are endangering
the tires of passingi automobiles.
One automobile tourist from the
east, on his way west over the Red
Trail, had a rear tire almost com
pletely ruined by a broken bottle,
as he was entering Beach from the
north side yesterday. This is poor
advertisement for Beach, and
some means should be taken to
make property holders conform
to the city ordinance, which pro
vides a penalty for its violation.
The man who dumps glass in the
middle of a street is as bad
as the man who cuts a tire up
with a jack knife through sheer
wantoness.
Rev. Trinklein left on No. 1
Monday monring for Lewistown
to attend the conference of the
Montana district of the Lutheran
synod. He will not return until
fiext week.
Clean-Up Week
Is On In Beach
Back Yards and Alleys Are Un
dergoing Complete Spring
Rejuvenation by
Citizens.
As the Chronicle goes to press,
Ihe clcan-up week movement is
on in full blast, and the citizens
of Beach are making a strenuous
campaign for city cleanliness.
Back yards and alleys, cellars
and basements, attics, barns and
outhouses—all are showing signs
of the clean-up fever.
It is impossible, of course, that
all the work needed to effect a
transformation for the better can
be done in one week. Enough
impetus has been given the move
ment, however, to keep things
moving for some time, as it
should. The close of clean-up
week should not mean the aban
donment of the movement.
"Even though the formally de
clared clean-up week is nearly
ended, there should not be a let
up until the whole city shines
with cleanliness—and then kept
clean," said Health Officer Dr. H.
B. Muscus. "Every citizen should
take a personal pride in the ap
pearance of his property—not
alone the front yard, but the
back yard and nooks and cran
nies as well." Anything that
would be a reproach to your
neighbor should be a reproach
to yourself.
Now that the good work has
gotten such a splendid start, and
the work thus far accomplished
has demonstrated what can be
done, let every citizen of Beach
•o-operate to complete the job,
and then keep things clean.

il
S. A. Smith, sheriff of Golden Valley county during the past
term, this week definitely announces his candidacy to succeed him
self as sheriff of GoldenValleycounty. Mr. Smith's announcement
definitely sets at rest any rumors which may have been current
that he would not be a candidate, and meets with the approval of
the popular sheriff's many friends throughout the county. Mr.
Smith has been an efficient and painstaking public officer and has
discharged his duties with fairness and without partiality. From
an economic standpoint, his incumbency has been a splendid suc
cess as well. During the two years in which he has held the of
fice, he has collected approximately $9,000.00 in delinquent taxes
among them amounts which had been deemed incollectible..

Old Indian Fighter
Gone to his Reward
S. S. Campbell, Member of Sully's
Rrigade in 1861 and Former
Resident, Dies at
Rochester.
S. S. Campbell, a former Gold
en Valley resident, and survivor
of Sully's famous expedition
against the Indians in these parts
in 1861, died suddenly while at
tending church services Easter
Sunday, death being occasioned
by heart failure. Mr. Campbell
for the past four years has been
making his home at Rochester,
111., where death occurred, and
will be remembered by many of
our readers, having at one time
farmed near Sentinel Butte. He
paid this locality a visit last
October.
Mr. Campbell participated in
the famous battle of the Killdeer
mountains, where Sully's com
mand was engaged by an over
whelming host of the Indians.
So slrong was the attacking force
that the soldiers, numbering as
they did two brigades of 7500
men, well equipped with guns
and ammunition, had put up a
stiff fight lasting over a day lo
re-pel them, even though the In
dians, with the exception of a few
who were armed with muskets,
in the main depended upon bow
Mid
arrow warfare. Later, Mr.
Campbell was a member of
force detailed lo accompany 800
.Mtunigranl wagons on their way
lo Idaho. At Flat Top butle they
were again attacked by a large
force which llicy succeedcd in
repelling. The Indians were push
ed back to Beaver Creek, where
thev finally left them, Beaver
cieek at that time being the
boundary line of what Ihe Sioux
termed Iheir territory.
Making their way to Fort
Berthohl, llicy were again attack
ed by the Blackfeet. At that time
Fort Berthold was a French
trading post, the French laying
claim to this territory. In 1866
he returned lo Fort Snelling,
where he was mustered out.
During his period of service
Mr. Campbell kept a complete
diary of all incidents which took
place and the places visited.
Among them were the Golden
Valley as it is now called. This
diary has since been placed with
the Slate Historical society at
Bismarck, anel contains interest
ing historic information of the
happenings here at that time.
Mr. Campbell was a brother
in-law of W. R. Pendergrass of
this city, who did not receive
the news of his death unlil this
week.
Funeral services were held
at the Congregational church
Wednesday afternoon over the re
mains of J. Gee, who passed away
at his home in Seattle, Wash., of
heart failure. Mr. Gee was 54
years old. lie is survived by a
wife and hoy, both of whom were
present at the funeral. Mrs. Gee
is a sisler of Ihe Egan boys of
this city, and Ed. W. Egan, of
Burkcy. Interment was made in
the Beach cemetery following the
service, which was officiated at
by Rev. G. N. Keniston. Mrs.
Gee and family have the sym
pathy of their many friends here.
William Hoppe, manager of the
Dickinson branch of the J. I. Case
Machine Co., was a Beach visitor
Wednesday. While here he made
a elrive to the Smith Creek coun
try northwest of Beach. Mr.
Hoppe was formerly located here,
and has many friends who are
glad to learn of his promotion to
the responsibilities of the Dick
inson branch. He returned yes
terday morning.
BEACH BASE BALL TEAM
TO GLENDIVE SUNDAY.
With Ihe advent of warm
weather, the base ball boys are
undergoing strenuous training at
the local ball park in prepara
tion for the summer's schedule of
games. The opening game, which
was to have been played at Ollie
Sunday, has been postponed to a
later date, as the acceptance of
this date would prevent their
meeting the Glendive team until
,along after in the season. As a
result, the Beach boys will cross
bats with the Glendive aggrega
tion Sunday at that city, and the
Ollie game will occur the Sunday
following. The trip lo Glendive
will be made by auto.
The weather up to a day or two
ago has been so cold and disa
greeable that none of Ihe staff of
pitchers had been unable to de
velop many fancy slunts, but with
the present weather conditions,
if the boys can get in a few days*
work as contemplated, they should
he able lo give a good account of
themselves. Batting practice has
been the main workout, and the
boys have shown an ability to
sting the ball hard. They will
give a good account of themselves
this season.
LADIES ENTERTAIN AT
AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL.
A dainty one o'clock luncheon
was served in the domestic science
rooms of the agricultural high
school yesterday, at which the
Misses Anna Becker, Eleanor
Wall, Lila Hoverson, Doris Ball,
Marguerelle Wallace and Mary
DeMcrsc were hostesses in honor
of Mesdames Wall, Moffat, Wal
lace, Braslrup, Thorpe and Rich
ards.
The table was very attractively
decoratcel in lavender and while,
and the serving was done by Mary
DeMerse and Marguretle Wal
lace. The luncheon was prepared
by the young ladies, all of whom
are taking instructions in domes
tic science uneler Miss Luclla Coe,
the capable instructor of this de
partment. The menu consisted
of: Grape fruit cocktail salted
nuts roast veal: gravy mashed
potatoes with peas baking powd
er biscuits fruit jelly: combina
tion salad orange with whipped
cream coffee. It was delicious,
and reflected great credit upon
the young ladies' culinary ability.
JOHNSON-MOORE.
Announcements were received
in Beach the first of the week of
the marriage of Miss Sophia
Johnson to J. L. Moore, the lat

U. S. Note Still
Unanswered
Feeling of Grave Concern Is Be
ginning to Reappear in
Washington.
Washington May 4.—Two
weeks have passed since Ihe U.
S. dispatched to Germany its
note demanding that an abandon
ment of present methods of sub
marine warfare immediately be
declared and effective, and to
night the stale department was
slill without any definite infor
mation. indicating that the de
nand woulel be complied with.
Washington Concerned.
As the days go by and no reply
comes from Berlin anel Ambas
sador Gerard sends no word re
garding the altitude of the Ger
man government, an air of grave
concern is beginning to mani
fest itself in administration cir
cles.
Optimism Kept Up.
Public officials continue to
preserve an air of optimism. Pri
vately no attempt is made lo con
ceal the contrary feeling and this
feeling is certain to become pro
nounced unless some definite
news is forthcoming over night.
Doubtful of Outcome.
It is fell here that the very
length of time whieii has been
consumed by the German govern
ment in preparing a reply in it
self indiactcs that the communi
cation will nol take Ihe shape of
a simple response to the direct
and clearcut issue raised in the
American note. II is feared that
the reply is likely to assume an
argumentative1 character an.d
which scarcely can be regarded
as meeting the requirement of the
United Slales.
Germany not Decided Answer.
Ilerr von Jagow, the foreign,
minister at the reopening of the
sitting of the budget committee
of the Reichstag today said the
government had not reached a
decision with rcgarel to the sit
uation that had risen from the
American note to Germany re
garding Germany's submarine
warfare.
As soon as the imperial chan
cellor returns from headquarters,
Ilerr von Jagow said, he would
give the committee definite in
structions.
Gerard Dines with Emperor.
It has been learned that Dr.
Karl Helferich, the imperial
treasurer, is at headquarters par
ticipating in the conference on the
American note and the framing
of an answer thereto.
The Frankfurter Zeitung says
Ambassador Gerard twice dineel
with Emperor William and that
he also was able to see the Ger
man troops at an important point
on the front.
Manager O. C.. Holtz of the
Thompson Yards, Inc., is busily
engaged this week in making
further improvements in the
yards here. When he assumed
Ihe management of the yards
here this winter. Mr. Holtz made
extensive alterations in the con
cern's office rooms, which gives
them a decidedly handsome ap
pearance. The present changes
consist of re-arrangement of the
yards and filling of low places. In
asmuch as the Beach branch has
acteel as a feeder for the* south
line branches, a complete yard
rearrangement was necessary in
order to accomodate the im
mense quantity of material which
the Thompson people have in stock
A warehouse, we understand, is
being considered to relieve the
congestion, though no announce
ment has so far been made that
is definite.
