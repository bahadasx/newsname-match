ment President Wilson and Secretary Lansing Aban

That the Dispatches Would Not be Available . Before
Morning.
Washington. May 4. Germany's re
ply to the demand of the United
States for Immediate abandonment of
present methods of submarine warfare,
delivered to Ambassador Gerard today,
was awaited by officials of the Wash
ington government tonight with ex
pectant tension. They were without
.nv definite idea of what the commu
nication contained. A brief message
from Ambassador Gerard as well as
press reports, however, had created
the impression that the imperial gov
ernment would propose conditions
which the United States could not ac
cept. .
President Wilson Stands Firm.
It was reiterated that President
Wilson stood unalterably by the po
sition declared in the note to Ger
many that the abandonment of pres
ent submarine methods must be de-
ired and effected Immediately, or
the United States must sever diplo
matic relations. This demand was
designated to permit Of no argument
and high officials repeatedly have as
serted that anything short of a literal
compliance would be followed by a
diplomatic rupture.
The official copy of the note hardly
will reach Washington before tomor
row night, but the document was
given to the press in Berlin tonight
emd the unofficial text was expected
to reach the United States early to
morrow morning. .
Meaning of Message Net Clear.
Ambassador Gerard's message was
sent before he had examined the note
itself. Its meaning was not entirely
clear because of errors in transmis
sion of the diplomatic cipher.
Secretary Lansing declined to com
ment on the message or make it pub
lic, because be feared it was garbled
or that Mr. Gerard, not having seen
the note itself, might have made in
accurate deductions. Furthermore,'
the ambassador had indica;-i that his
message must be regarded as being
highly confidential.
Errors in Transmission.
Secretary Lansing sent the despatch
to the White 'House lor the inrorma
tion of President Wilson. At the same
time an effort was made to have the
errors of transmission corrected. It
appeared tonight that the contents of
the note would be known before the
corrections could be made.

to press despatches saying that the
German chancellor would have the
German public behind him in the ef
forts to avoid a breach of relations
with the United States, "so far as can
be done without sacrificing the prin
ciple enunciated in the German mani
festo of February. 8."
This manifesto of February 8 an
nounced to the world Germany's in
tention of treating as warships armed
merchant ships of hostile nations.
It was clearly indicated that in the
future Germany intended to sink
without warning belligerent merchant
ships carrying: armament, on the
ground that they were armed for pur
poses of offense and that commanders
of British merchantmen had instruc
tions to attack Gorman submarines.
The position of the United States is
that merchant ships have a right to
arm themselves for detensiive pur
poses, and that as long as that arma
ment was carried and used for de
fense the vessels should receive the
same treatment as other peaceful
trading ships. This position was. re
stated and elaborated upon in a mem
orandum on the subject prepared by
Secretary Lansing at the direction of
President Wilson and' only a few days
after the despatch of the note to Ger
many, sent to the governments of Eu-
jone, neutral as well as belligerent.,
some omciais tonignt rouna a nope-
ful indication in a press despatch
which stated that considerable .pertur
bation was apparent in Berlin over
the effect which "concessions-" to be
made might have on German public
opinion.
Berlin, May 4. (By Wireless to The
Associated Press, via Tuckerton, N.
J.) The reply to the American note
on submarine warfare is believed to
have been handed to Ambassador Ge
rard this afternoon. Considerable
perturbation is expressed over the
effect whicH concessions may have on
public opinion here.
Dr.- Von Bethmann-Hollweg, the im
perial chancellor, undoubtedly will
have the great masses of the people
with him in a desire to avoid a
breach .in the diplomatic relations
with the United States so far as can
be done without sacrificing the prin
ciple enunciated in the German mani
festo of Feb. 8.
The chancellor with Admiral "Von
Holtzendorf, head of the na'al gen
eral staff, Dr. Karl Helfferieh, the sec
retary of the treasury, and other par
ticipants in the council at headquar
ters, returned to Berlin early this
morning.
The note with its exolnnation of the
German attitude toward the British
'starvation" policy, will be one of
the longest diplomatic documents of
the war. It will be released for pub
lication here, in all probaDinty, on
Friday morning.

LANSING GETS A DESPATCH
FROM AM3ASSADOR GERARD
Said to Contain Information That
German Reply Will- Not be Accept
able.
Washington, May 4. Germany's
manifesto of Feb. 8, to the principles
of which press despatches from Her
lin indicate the imperial government
adheres in its reply to the American
note, is assumed by officials of the
state department to be the memoran
dum of that date declaring that in
future all armed nvurciaiit . shiDS,i3f
belligerent nationality would be con
sidertd Vv-arships subject to attack
without warning. '

refusal to discuss the contents of a
despatch received today from Am
bassador Gerard it became known late

tion as has been received, officials uf
the government fear that Germany
has attached conditions to her reply
that may make it impossible for the

relations.

CONFEREES DISAGREE ON
ARMY REORGANIZATION
Contention Over Volunteer Army and
Nitrate Plant Amendments.
Washington, May 4. Conferees on
the army reorganization bill late to
day disagreed on important features
of the measure and .adjourned until
matters in disagreement can be taken
up In the house. - --,.-. .
The rocks on which the committee
broke were the federal volunteer army
and the $15,000,000 government nitrate
plant amendments adopted by the
senate.
Washington, May 4. The Hollls
farm loan bill, embodying the adminis
tration plan for establishing a sys
tern of rural credits, passed the sen
ate tonight by a iote of 58 to 5.
Senators Brandegee. Lodge. Oliver.
rage and vv adsworth. all republicans,
voted against the measure.
The bill, after almost two weeks of
debate, passed the senate virtually as
reported by the banking committee.
An amendment by Senatar Smoot re
alising me salaries oi xarm loan
board from $100,000 to $7,500 which
was adopted by a vote of 26 to 25 In
the committee of the whole, was re
considered when the bill reached the
senate and was defeated, 29 to 31, al
though eight democratic senators
voted with the republicans for. the re
duction.
A somewhat similar bill has been
reported by the house banking com
mittee and, it is said, will be brought
up for consideration in the house soon.
Like the senate measure, it would ere
ate a chain of farm loan banks, but
it differs in means of operation.
The senate bill provides for a non
partisan farm loan board to consist of
the secretary of the treasury and four
others, having general control of
farm loan system of twelve or more
land, banks and of farm loan associa
tions through which actually would
be made.
Each land bank would have a cap
ital stock of at least $500,000 to be
subscribed by the government if not
taken by the public. The farm loan
ascosciation would be cooperative,
made up .of ten or more farmers who
woul dobtain acharter from their dis
trict land bank. A farmer desiring to
become a borrower would be required
to take stock in the loan association
equal to 5 per cent, of his loan; the
association in turn would take an
equal amount of stock in the land
bank, which would appraise the se
curity offered and make . the loan
mrcmgri me aassLH-iaLiuii. ju mun-
gages amountin- to $50,000 a bank
might issue a like amount of farm
loan bonds, which would be secured
by all twelve land banks.
All profits would go to the loan as

borrowers who are shareholders In

Conferees Differ
on Army Bill
Nl
HOUSE MEMBERS FIRM
Representative Hay Stated Postively
That the House Would Not Accept
the Volunteer Army Plan Adjourned
Without Date.
Washington, May 4. Notwithstand
ing the disagreement Senator Cham
berlain, chairman of the senate con
ferees, said tonight he had hopes that
, good bill would be worked out.
House Conferees Would Not Yield
"The house conferees would ' not
yield to the senate provision for the
volunteer army or the government ni
trate plant," said the senator.. "There
are a number of minor points in the
bill also which are m disagreement
But the main points seemed thus far
to be the only irreconciliable features.
Representative Hay has promised
to return the nitrate plant amendment
to the house for further instructions.
He flatly stated, however, that the
house would not accent the volunteer
army and the senate conferees would
not recede. In view of the apparent
mpasse the conference adjourned, not
to meet again until an effort is made
to get further instructions from the
house. We do not expect to take up
the disputed points in the senate at
this time because our conferees are
unanimous and the senate has already
passed on the subjects in controver
sy."
Had Been' Making Good Progress.
Up to the time of the break, which
had been forecast, the conferees had
been making good progress on regular
army reorganization and reserve fea
tures. They had tentatively agreed
on a standing army in time of peace
of 180,000 men, 40,000 more than the
house tall carried, and an elastic or
ganization scheme contained in the
senate bill which would provide for
expansion in time of war or threat
ened war to 220,000 men. They also
had agreed to the house re-organiza
tion plan for the national guard
which would provide for federalization
or the r2serve force and its expansion

Hartford, May 4. Former President
F. W. Johnstone of state chamber of
commerce declared today at a meeting
of the directors of that body held
in Hartford that freight troubles in
Connecticut the past few months could
be laid definitely at the door of the
great transportation companies. He
asserted that he had become convinced
from investigation that conditions in
different cities were not handled effi
cienty by the New Haven road, but
that the road could have capable men
in authority to deal with such matters
if it would pay for them. He pointed
out that a Hartford freight agent was
vested with practically no authority,
the train and yardmasters in about the
same position, and everybody having
anything in charge had to confer with
somebody higher up. A number of di
rectors took part in the discussion.
Secretary . Thomas J. Kelley of the
manufacturers' bureau of Hartford
thought that a good deal of the trouble
was caused by unskilled help. In a
