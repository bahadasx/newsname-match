EDITORIALS
BIRTH OF A NATION.
As we go to press today the city
has arrested the photo play manager,
who has put on "The Birth of, a Na
tion" and they are in our municipal
court on trial for the violation of our
city ordinance. It is a hard fought
battle. The city has won at every
stage thus far. There are ten great
lawyers in the fight. Against the play
there is ex-Attorney General Webb
Byers corporation counsel Guy Mil
ler, city solicitor, his assistant, also
Hon. Geo. H. Woodson, S. Joe Brown
and Casper Schenk. On the photo
play side are Read & Read, O. M.
Brockett, Nelson and one of the reg
ular show lawyers. They began their
suit last Saturday by asking an in
junction against the city restraining
them from bothering the play. Judge
Ayres of the district court overruled
the injunction. Then the city arrest
ed the company employes for a vio
lation of the city ordinance and that
trying. The city called as witness
is the case that they are now
es about thirty people, Rev. Dr. J. E.
Kirbye, pastor of the Plymouth Con
gregational church Dr. J. K. Porter,
pastor of the Presbyterian tihtirch on
East Side Dr. B/ ,F. Fellman, paStor
of Calvary Baptist church,. East Des
Moines, Casper Schenk and Mr. Rags
dale, an old soldier. They were all
star: witnesses fpr the city end
wi&t

,**h
against the play. There was no doubt
in the minds of all of theni that the
play was immoral, obscene, indecent
and calculated to incite race anti
pathy and should be suppressed. Too
much praise cannot be given all of
the above named witnesses, as they
are leaders of the Anglo race here,
and each one simply did their duty
as a high class, broad minded Chris
tian gentleman. No colored witness
has yet been put on the stand.
A MBGHTY UNIVERSITY ALMOST
FIFTY YEARS OLD.
Nearly fifty years ago the charter
for Howard university, Washington,
D. C., was granted, and in the half
century has sent into the world up
wards of 3,000 well equipped men and
women as teachers, preachers, den
tists, doctors, lawyers and laymen,
many of whom have made their im
press on the community in which they
have lived and every true graduate
of this well known educational insti
tution is requested to at once com
municate with the alumni secretary,
care the university.
The charter of Howard university
(Washington, D. C.), which was
granted March 2, 1867, grew out of a
plan for "Howard Theological Semin
ary," which afterward took on the
form of Howard "Normal and Theo
logical Institute" for the education of
teachers and preachers, and finally
Howard university, as now, a uni
versity with departments as follows:
Academic, consisting of college of
arts and science and teachers college,
the academy, commercial college,
school of manual and applied sciences
and conservatory of music, profession
al, consisting of school of theology,
school of medicine and school of law.
The April number of the Howard
university, Washington, D. C., Record
issued as an alumni number has been
received. It is a 48 page edition with
an illuminated cover in the college
colors and contains much information
of interests to the alumni located in
all parts of this and foreign coun
tries. Any alumnus can obtain a
copy by applying to the alumni sec
retary of the general alumni associa
tion, care of the university.
SAMPSON FOR ATTORNEY GEN
ERAL.
Mr. Sampson has won for himself
during his long term of service as
attorney general an enviable reputa
tion and is commonly spoken of as a
strong, fearless, efficient officer.
His name would impress one as his
bein a man of great physical
strength, yet such is not the case.
His great strength lies in his intel
lect. Mr .Sampson is a man of slight
ly less than medium height and
weight, but his great administrative
executive ability, his keen, clear con
ception of the law, his fearlessness in
its enforcement, the courage of his
convictions on all questions looking
to the betterment of the people, ag a
whole, the upbui'ding of a greater
Iowa, his untiring efforts in behalf of
the wealth producers and laws in
which they are directly interested as
legal adviser for them concerning
workmen's compensation laws, with
his fairness to all classes in his offi
cial duty and his great capacity for
assimilating work have won for him
in his campaign throughout the state
the slogan—"Sampson, the Strong
Man, for Attorney General."
We asked Mr. James B. Weaver,
republican candidate for representa
tive from Polk county at the June
primary, whose portrait appeared re
cently in, these pages, to tell some
thing of his early life and start in
Des Moines. He said:
"I was born at Bloomfield in Davis1
county, Iowa, July 19, 1861. I was
raised in that town, attended the com
mon schools there and when about
17 years of age attended two winters
at the southern Iowa Normal and
Scientific Institute at the same place.
In the summer time I farmed those
two years. The first tract was twen
ty acres. I had a little mare, "Pet,"
and hired another horse, plowed the
land, and then cultivated it with one
horse and a double-shovel plow. The
second year I rented a stump sixty
acres out on the old Goss farm and
handled things the same way.
I then entered in my 18th year the
general merchandise store of John H.
Taylor, clerking at $25.00 per month
for two years. I saved enough fromi
this to attend the law school at the
state university, which I entered in
the fall of 1881, graduating in June,
1882. I then came to Des Moines to
find work in some law office. Five
dollars was my entire available capi
tal. I had never been in a city as!
large as Des Moines. I arrived in the
night and stopped at the old Morgan
house, which took 50 cents of my five
dollars. Next morning I applied at
the office of C. H. Gatch for a chance
to work. I .got it, at a salary of $26
per month a office clerk. I went out
then to look for a room. I found it
in an old mansard-roofed house on
Sixth avenue between the Rock Island
and the Des Moines Union tracks. I
rented that room at $5.00 per month
and found a boarding place at $2.50
er week on Third street above Grand.
In August, 1882, Colonel Gatch and
Mr. Bancroft dissolved partnership.
Gatch called me into1 the office and
asked whether I would go with him
for a year. I was not to be known
ip the firm and was to receive -$26
per month.' It can be imagined that
I answered in the affirmative. I was
concerned for aChance to Work and
to make a living. I never worked
harder or was happier thiln when I
Iff"
1
found that chance. During that yeat!
I worked from choice, not from neces
sity, days, nights an^ Sundays trying
to make myself a necessity. I was
worried about the future. At the end
of the year I became a member of
the firm of Gatch & Weaver and was
to have $50 per month and if 20 per
cent of the net earnings at the end
of the year amounted to more I was
to have the difference, jrhus I began
my career'as A laWyfcft**
As can be imagined, I haVe a warm
place in my heart .for Colonel Gatch
and Judge Bancroft, who gave me a
chance to work.
BURNETTE FOR RECORDER,
Mr. A. S. (Buzz) Burnette of Val
ley Junction has announced his name
as a candidate for county recorder,
subject to the republican primaries.
Mr. Burnette is one of the best quali
fied young men fo$ this office that
Polk county could fihd. He has been
deputy county auditor for about seven
years, also worked f.n the recorder's
office a short time. He has lived in
Valley Junction for .the past twenty
two years. For three years he was
postmaster there. He was in the
grocery and hardware store for sev
eral years. The editor of The By
stander has known Mr. Burnette for*
many years and has found him to be
a gentleman, honest with all races.
He has never held an elective office.
His many friends solicit your support
H. M. HAVNER FOR ATTORNEY
GENERAL,
One of the strongest members of
the bar has entered the race for the
office of attorney general on the re
publican ticket—H. M. Havner of
Marengo. It will be recalled that
when the fight over the saloon peti
tion came up four or five years ago
this lawyer was called to Des Moines
to take charge of the case for the
drys. It was a long hard fight
through both the district and the su
preme court, with a decision finally in
favor of the drys. Shortly after this
another saloon petition was circulat
ed and again Mr. Havner was called
upon to lead the fight for the drys.
This time the saloon interests were
so completely snowed under that they
gave up the fight before the drys
were half way through introducing
their evidence.
His fights against the saloons have
carried him into contact with many
of the ablest lawyers of Iowa and he
has always been equal to the occas
ion. He whipped the saloons out of
his own county years ago and has
been the leader in fights against them
in many other places.
Mr, Havner is the son of John
Havner, a civil war veteran, Mr.
Havner himself was a private in the
Spanish-American war. He was born
and raised in the good old state of
Iowa. Worked his way through col
lege and law school and started in
the practice at Marengo about seven
teen years ago. He entered into the
court work with a firm determination
to put his best into every case. So
that now he is regarded as one of
the strongest trial lawyers in Iowa
and has an extensive practice in both
the state and federal courts.
As a member of the Methodist
church he holds a position on one of
its most important national commit
tees. As a farjner he has some of
the best improved farms in Iowa as
a business man he has been. unusually
successful. 'f
This is the first tiiiie he has ever
sought favors of the voters. He is
not such a politician-as the voter is
best acquainted with, but he is well
qualified to fill the office and in cast
ing your vote for him as attorney
general you vote for a man political-*
ly clean, professionally able and
armed with every evidence of a strong
character.
He is the man Iowa needs in the
office of attorney general.

SENATOR CHARLES H. THOMAS
FOR STATE TREASURER.
Mr, Thomas is worthy of recogni
tion in this connection.
His legislative record proves him to
be a man of broad comprehension—a
most intelligent, efficient and fear
elss worker for every law for the ad
vancement of society, the protection
of the wealth producer and better
ment of the home.
Some of the most notable laws for
which he :s responsible are the fam
ous blue sky law, prohibitory amend
ment, minimum wage and other such
laws which have worked for the bet
terment of society.
Mr. Thomas has championed no
laws which would especially privilege
any individual, race, class or people.
He has always worked on the broad
assumption that we were all Ameri
cans and citizens of Iowa and for the
advancement of her citizenship, her
laws must be for the benefit of all
her people.
Starting life as a farm hand with
out a dollar, but with unlimited will
power and determination, he has
made a success of life and is now one
of the leading merchants and bann
ers of southwestern Iowa.
His senatorial record shows that he
has never forgotten his early life nor
his duty to those less fortunate. As
senator he was always found cham
pioning the cause and interests of the
wealth producing classes and the
many testimonials of appreciation and
recommendation from the different
labor .bocjies .throughout the state,
thanking him activity in thete»4
behalf insures him their appreciation
of the necessity of him being elected
to the office of state treasurer, for as
a member of the executive council his
influence in their behalf will be great
er than that as senator.
Mr. Thomas' practical business
training, together with his legislative
knowledge, has especially equipped
him for the office to which he aspires,
and will, if elected, make us a most
efficient state treasurer.
