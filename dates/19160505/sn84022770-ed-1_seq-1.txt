SAVING in
BUREAU OF INSPECTION SUB
MITS REPORT —PRAISES CITY
CLERK HOAGE.
The practice of the city of Olympia
In loaning itself some $12,000 from
Its bond sinking fund, by which it
.gives some $960 a year on 8 per
cent warrants, is scored by the state
bureau of inspection in its report of
its annual examination of the city
offices, just completed at a cost of
$204.70. The city officials, however,
figure the city is ahead considerable
money each year bj» this system and
will not discontinue it.
City Clerk W. A. Hoage's manage
ment of his office is highly commend
ed by the report, as the conduct of
the offices of police justice and chief
of police, by the former officials.
Judge Milton Giles and Ben F. Hall
respectively, are roundly scored.
Hoage "Competent Official."
"All of the records and files are
very well and satisfactorily kept,"
the report says with regard to the
city clerk's office, adding that "Mr.
Hoage is an intelligent, courteous
and competent official, and the peo
ple of Olympia are to be congratu
lated upon having a city clerk of his
ability. He Is administering the af
fairs of his office In an efficient and
commendable manner."
The city's floating indebtedness to
tals $80,431.89, the report says, or
917,743.82 more than its legal debt
limit of ltt per cent of the present
valuation of $3,826,731, by which it
taps titled to a floating debt of $49,-
400.96. Included in this item of ex
cess indebtedness, however, to. the
$12,631.26 which has been advanced
from the sinking fund to retire out
standing expense fund warrants, so
that the actual excess of indebted
ness above the legal limit is approx
imately $6,100. The floating debt
has been reduced $6,170.34 during
the past year.
Park Board Commended.
The members of the park board,
the report ,says, "appear to be admin
istering the affairs in a very com
mendable manner." The issuance
last year of $7,323.11 in current ex
pense fund warrants to cover ex
penditures In connection with the
purchase of the municipal water sys
tem, was criticised as "clearly Ille
gal," on the ground that the acquire
ment of the system was not manda
tory, and that, as the city has ex
ceded its debt limit, "no warrants
can legally be issued except for man
datory purposes."
Local improvement funds were not
checked by the examiner, but Mr.
Hoage expects to do this work dur
ing the summer. The fact that the
city has no contract, with the local
banks "for the payment of interest
on average daily balances, as ex
pressly provided by the laws of the
state," is again cited. The officials,
In replying, state that neither bank
will pay interest on the city deposits.
Relief Fund for War Blind.
Frank M. Kenney, cashier of the
Olympia National bank, has been
named sub-treasurer for this district
of the Permanent Blind Relief War
Fund for the assistance of the thou
sands of French, Belgian and Brit
ish soldiers who have been blinded
In the European war and who are
reported to be in a pitiable condi
tion. Donations are being made at
the Olympia National bank. Though
specifically organized to aid the
blind of theße three nations, the
Fund will ultimately contribute to
ward the assistance of every blind
person in the world.

OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, MAY 5, 1916
STATE DEMOCRATS ENDORSE WILSON HID LISTER
WORK IN HARMONY FOR COMING CAMPAIGN IN ENTHUSIASTIC
CONVENTION AT NORTH YAKIMA—PLATFORM LAUDS NA
TIONAL AND STATE ADMINISTRATIONS AND POINTS TO PAR
TY'S LEGISLATIVE RECORD.
Democrats of the state of Washing
ton, in enthusiastic convention at
North Yakima last Tuesday, worked
harmoniously in plans for the com
ing campaign, adopted a platform
strongly praising the administrations
of President Wilson and Governor
Lister, named Hugh Wallace national
committeeman for this state, and
elected delegates to the national con
vention at St. Louis.
It was Wilson and Lister all the
way through. There were rumors
and near rumors that some opposi
tion might develop against the gov
ernor, but no one could be found
who would admit it and the dele
gates Anally decided that the rumors
emanated from those outside the
convention who were naturally anx
ious to have "something happen."
When the governor took the plat
form in response to a call for a
speech the delegates leaped to their
feet and gave round after round of
applause and as he tore into the is
sues in state and nation he was fre
quently stopped by repeated cheers.
Governor Announces Candidacy.
In concluding his remarks the gov
ernor told the convention that he
would be a candidate for renomina
tion and election this fall, but that if
the Democrats of Washington chose
some other Democrat to be their
standard-bearer, he would take off his
coat and strive with might and main
to elect him.
The largest delegation that has at
tended a Washington state conven
tion in 20 years worked harmonious
ly throughout, the only real ripple of
excitement being when George F.
Cotterill and Charles A. Reynolds,
on behalf of King county, attempted
to stampede the convention to Jud
son Shorett for national committee
man. The King county delegation
was by no means unanimous and as
a matter of fact did not expect to
break in on the lineup for Hugh C.
Wallace of Pierce, whose friends had
lined up practically the whole con
vention to back him. As soon as the
vote was announced the incident was
practically forgotten and the dele
gates hurried on to the next order of
business.
The queation of endorsing the non
partisan idea for state, county and
municipal offices, which was expected
to cause a lively fight on the floor of
the convention, did not materialize,
for the word was quickly passed af
ter the caucus of the Pierce county
delegation that Governor Lißter had
suggested that, inasmuch as the non
partisan idea was not properly a par
tisan measure, no mention of it
should be made in the party platfrrm
and that several members of the Non
partisan League had urged that the
league did not want the endorse
ment of any party. Nonpartisanship

of Spokane
Democratic Candidate for United
States Senator, Who Was Given a
Rousing Ovation at the State
Convention Last Tuesday.
was not discussed before the plat
form committee or on the floor of
the convention.
Judge McKinney of Walla Walla
acted as temporary chairman and
gave the keynote speech in which lie
lauded President Wilson and Gov
ernor Lister and pointed out many
reasons for returning both to office
this fall. Colonel Howard Hathaway
of Snohomish and Carl Eshelman of
Pierce were unanimously chosen per
manent chairman and permanent sec
retary respectively.
Turner Receives Ovation.
Judge George Turner, who is a can
didate for United States senator, was
enthusiastically received and deliv
ered a splendid address dealing prin
cipally with the European and Mexi
can questions. He expressed abso
lute confidence in the wisdom of
President Wilson in handling the se
rious situations that confront the na
tion aid averred that Washington
now hgd the first real governor since
the late John R. Rogers occupied the
executive chair.
There were no real contests for del
egates to the national convention or
the choice of presidential electors.
The districts caucussed quickly and
announced their choice which was
ratified by the convention. Follow
ing the recommendation of the rules
committee, a double delegation was
decided upon by the convention. Four
women will be on the delegation to
St. Louis, Mrs. Harrison G. Foster of
Pierce, Mrs. B. F. Shields of King
and Mrs. Mary A. Monroe and Mrs.
Elizabeth Christian of Spokane.
The delegates are:

George F. Christianson, Skamania;
C. C. Brown, Cowlitz; Francis Dona
hue, Lewis; G. W. Hoxie, Chelan;
Joseph A. Sloan, King; A. T. Stream,
Pacific.
The platform adopted by the con
vention is one of strong endorse
ment for both the national and state
administrations and asserts that a
Democratic president and a Demo
cratic congress has enacted more re
medial legislation in the past three
years than had been written into the
statutes in 50 years before; praises
President Wilson for his handling of
both foreign and domestic affairs;
points to the development of Alaska
as of especial interest to Washington
and calls for adequate national pre
paredness.
References to state Issues indicate
that the convention was strongly
against the attacks of the last Re
publican legislature on the initiative
and referendum and condemned the
Whitney election bills. The courage,
energy and efficiency of Governor Lis
ter were commended and attention
called to the successful administra
tion of the eight-hour and minimum
wage laws and the increased efficien
cy of state institutions without in
creased cost, and calls for a constitu
tional convention.

WANTS DEED REVOKED
Mrs. Crodle Sues to Recover Interest
in Rutledge Homestead.
All of her relatives are made de
fendants by Mrs. Stella Rutledge
Crodle in a suit Instituted by her in
the local superior court during the
past week in which she alleges that,
through undue influence and fraud,
she signed a quit-claim deed to a
homestead taken up by her mother
in this county some 30 years ago.
Her step-mother, formerly Mrs.
Marian Rutledge, now Mrs. T. Ives
Dodge, though always treating her in
an affectionate manner, told her the
homestead was worthless, Mrs. Cro
dle alleges, and later obtained her
signature to a deed to her half of the
property. Mrs. Crodle also charges
that Mrs. Dodge plotted with a rela
tive, William Miles, to buy delin
quent tax certificates against the
homestead and to foreclose on the
property, but says Miles refused to
do this, after first starting suit in
1897.
Mrs. Crodle claims she did not
know she was signing a deed to the
property and says she has never re
ceived any part of the $250 consid
eration mentioned in the instru
ment. All the parties to the contro
versy are well known.
Ordinance Regulates Jitneys.
An ordinance regulating the oper
ation of jitney buses in this city and
requiring a $2,000 bond to protect
passengers and a S3O annual license
fee, was passed unanimously by the
city council Tuesday night, after a
considerable debate. When applica
tion is made for a license, the route
to be traveled must be specified, the
schedule must be approved by the
chairman of the street committee
and three resident taxpayers must be
given as references. Mayor Mottman
has refused to approve the ordinance
and has addressed a statement to the
council criticizing various features
of it.
Gaines Candidate for Sheriff.

the well known men of the county,
this week announced his candidacy
for the Republican nomination for

"NO INTENTION OF BLIGHTING
OLYMPIA," GENERAL FREIGHT
AGENT SAYS.
Responding to the communication
addressed to his comppny last week
by Frank M. Kenney on behalf of
the Chamber of Commerce, H. B.
Still, general western freight agent
of the Northern Pacific railway, this
week gave assurances that proper
adjustment of freight rates would
be made, stating that his company
! "certainly had no intention of
! lng Olympia in any way."
j The correspondence arose when
the Chamber of Commerce, after an
j Investigation, discovered that rates
on local freight in and out of the
( city are higher in several clasßiflca
j tions and commodities than those
, operating as to other Puget Sound
cities. It instructed Mr. Kenney to
j present the situation to the North
| era Pacific, as the pioneer railroad
in the city, upon whose tariffs the
Union Pacific based its rates when
I its new line was recently opened into
this city.
Urges Immediate Actios.
Replying to Mr. Still's letter, Mr.
Kenney suggested that "Immediate
steps be taken to put the class rates
In the proper shape," adding
"as every day's delay operates
against us, we would request that
the class rates be made effective
now and the other commodity rates
be adjusted later."
"We certainly bad no Intention of
slighting Olympia in any way," Mr.
Still's letter says, "and will give care
ful consideration to your criticisms
with a view to making any adjust
ment which may be proper, and will
advise you later as to conclusion*
reached."
Public Service Board Favorable.
Answering this, Mr. Kenney wrote:
"We can obtain the permission of
the public service commission for
the immediate installation of class
rates, as this is a matter that can
be passed upon very quickly, and I
therefore hope to receive word with
in a day or two that steps are being
taken accordingly." /
When the rates on local freight
are adjusted satisfactorily, the Cham
ber of Commerce, plans to take up
with the railroads the removal of
the present differential of from SSO
to S4O per car on Eastern freight
now charged local merchants. Great
er difficulty is anticipated In
ing the re-adjustment of this feature 1
of local freight charges, and it may
be necessary for the Chamber to pre
sent the situation to the interstate
commerce commission before obtain
ing the desired reductions.
Union Sunday School Meetings.
Plans for union Sunday school
meetings In this city Memorial Sun
day, Hay 28, will be completed at a
meeting of the Superintendents' Un
ion at the T. M. C. A. next Monday
evening. Two meetings are to be
held at the same time, on* at the
Presbyterian church for the pupils
of the primary grades and their par
ents, and the other at the Y. M. C. A.
for the older classes. Mrs. D. B.
Werts is chairman of the arrange
ments committee.
Thurston Oote 98,000 for Roads.
The state auditor has divided
1214,437 among the counties of the
state as the distribution of funds col
lected by the secretary of state for
automobile licenses and fines, during
the period from October 1, 1915, to
April 1 last. The apportionment is
made on the basis of the amount of
permanent highway taxes paid by
each county, and the money Is to be
used in the maintenance of -perma
nent highways. Thurston received
$3,090.58, while King county got
$51,540, or a fourth of the entire
amount.
ion Is Defeated.
With the patrons of the Black
Lake district voting solidly against
the proposal, the plan to consolidate
the Belmore and Black Lake school
districts and to erect a new school,
probably at Belmore. was defeated
by a decisive vote at the election the
fore part of this week. Belmore res
idents favored the plan.
