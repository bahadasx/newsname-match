PEOPLE SLAIN
Not Biuce the morder of Edward
"W. Carmack by Duncan B. and
a Robin Cooper lias the Capitol City
and the State been so stirred as by
the fatal shooting of Harry Stokes
toy Charles Trabne last Wednesday.
. Poiuts of similarity between the
' two tragedies iday easily be found.
Carmack lost bis life because of
liia fearless course as a newspaper
editor in exposing public abuses
end seeking to remedy them.
' Stokes, as attorney for 'the tax
. payers of Nashville, assailed the
removal of its officeholders and
rendered a service of priceless valoe
in the reform of the administration
. of that city. Y.7',. d-'
He was brilliant, courageous and
honest. Although not uite- 40
years of age,-he had risen to the
highest rank in his profession.
He was looked on in Nashville
v ...
as the tribune of the people, They
idolized him and have been plunged
Y into the deepest sorrow by his
leath. . YY Yv. ;
It is said that he had provided
in bis will a fund for carrying on
the suits in the taxpayers' interest,
showing that he feared he would
bis life because of his fearless
- coarse. - Y;'., Y" Y . ''
' Trabae also was a capable young
lawyer, and that he had many
friends was iudicated by the num
ber of his associates at the bar who
came to him at the jail immediately
after his arrest and proffered their
services to defend him. .
Bat this also is a feature uottm
like the Cooper case. That trage
3y divided Nashville socially, po
litically and in every other way.
Those who had been'' personal
friends of the assailants rallied to
' them. So . now they will do 1 in
Trabue's case. : . "t-
It is further indication of how
homicide is regarded with us. It
" . encourages jmen to commit such
crimes, , believing that 'they -will
' have the 'moral support df their
friends.. . YY;. YY":'7"
1 JTrabne represented the office
'V holders jn. the Nashville ouster
; caaesYf In the court proceedings
there were many bitter set-tos be
' . tween Stokes and himself. ; He re-
Y ebted'' f&bli statements which
Stokes, made i'Acfiording - to his
' ctoryjie, eninto VBjojkes' office
t 'and demanded that he sign a paper
apologizing IUC (WIWI Xl UHU HH1U.
Stokes, he claims, attacked him
And he killed him.
But Trabue went armed into the
ofSce of a man who was unarmed,
. a . . .
Y Shots were fired but a few seconds
after he entered the door. He
emerged coolly, announcing the
; deed he had committed.
Trabue has been considered an
Jhonest man, but the story he tells
will be accepted, with incredulity
toy many who weigh 11 the circum
stances. v
, ; No other mortal eye saw that af
fray. , The lips " that might speak
, are now cold in death. 1 Trabae
may escape punishment for this
awful deecL.but one would a thou'
cand times prefer to be in the shoes
of the corpse stained with the blood
of Harry. Stokes than in. those of
his wanton slayer.'
u The wheels of so-called .justice
already seem to be blocked and
Trabue already bAe been released
on bail. -Why the tremendous
haste as to his preliminary trial?
Why should his unsupported state,
ment be taken in preference to the
condemning surrounding circumstances?
v At the capitol a Tennessee judge
is on trial for impeachment because
of his acts on the beu'cb. The peo
ple of the State will hope that jus
tice is not going to sleep at the
Capitol City and that the facts as
to thjs tragedy shall be obtained
and the crime punished. 1
But what has occurred in Nash
ville will arouse the people of that
city, as did tho slaying of Mr. Car
mack1 arouse the people of the
State. vY-;-Y "- Y- YYY:
It will not deter courageous
men from doing their duty! Ten

A BALL PARK :
' FOR CAMDEN
s According td rumors, said to be
well defined, some of Camden's
progressive citkzens have taken
under consideration the organiza
tion of o stock company for the
promotion of a ball park near town.
It is argued that ground can be
leased for ten years or more, this
to b' enclosed with picket' fence
and suitable -seats -provided. 'This
could be done with a small outlay
of capital, and it would require
very little time to carry it out."
The promoters of the scheme
have no further interest ia the
matter other than providing a suit
ableplace for open air amusements
during the heated term and seeing
Camden keeping pace with other
progressive towns, v v
The 8piritof progreesive'ness is
abroad in Camden, and we trust
that something' worth while may
be accomplished. I- ,

Hints to Gardeners.
. tit isn't always a safe plan to fol
low the almanac and seed-planting
calendar, for the weather man may
slip one over you and your crop
will be ruined, says Professor
Spade, a garden ; expert, in the
Chattanooga'News. , ; v " v ;
Our fathers let nature tell them
when 'to sow, and plant and they
did fairly well, too.
k They followed the good, old rule
of planting corn when the apple
trees blossomed; onions and peas
when the peach trees putout their
first "blooms, -and beet seed when
the cherry trees burst into flower.
Among the early planting should
be onions, lettuce, raddishes, beets.
Will Be a Good Day to
1 ..;).
early carrots, early cajbbage, peas'
parsnip, spinach, salsify, potatoes,
mustard and cauliflower.
From two - to four weeks later,
depending upon the weather, the
gardener may plant beans, late cab
bage, late carrots, cucumbers, sweet
corn, and after warm weather is
assured, eggplant, peppers and to
matoes. The last three should
have been started under glaes-and
transplanted after all danger of
frost has passed, , j

CUTS BOTH W AYS.
Timber and agricultural lands
are two of the State's very import
and resources. These may stfffer
from mauy causes, .'but certainly
the way in which much of the
agricultural land is tilled at present
is a most potent factor, and playing
a very strong party not only in
creating waste land, bat also in
causing timber loss. If there were
an inexhaustible supply of timber,
if there were an inexhaustible
amount of land to clear, there
might be some excuse for this type
of waste. But vast amounts of
timber throughout 7 the State are
dependent upon the cultivated
laud. How? In tin's way i , When
the tilled land especially on slopes
and hills, goes to waste more wood
lands are . strippe off to ' fill its
place, resulting in less and lees
timber. This process of improper
ly handling agricultural land cuts
like a two-edged sword, in two
ways. . ilt causes timber loss and
wastelands. -'Y; Y.:
' The system that keeps the iand
built up aud reclaims the waste
places helps to maintain the wood
lands. Many acres now in timber
will and should logically be cleared
for farm use, but why hasten that
day by wasting? Why not main
tain cleared land and let the tjleaT
ing of more land com about natur
ally throughtan increase in popu
lation? It is a destructive method
constantly to rob the 1 farm land.
As a natural result it goes to waste
and to gullies. This method nks
the woodlands pay the . penalty by
cutting off the timber, and then
subject them to the-same -wasteful ,
treatment that the others under
went. This will never - develop
these two" resources of the State.
T Why not change around ? Every
farmer is a producer so long as he
maintains his soil for continuous
production.' He is not a produce-r
if he simply takes something from, -his
soil. Therefore let him reclaim
the waste areas, build up the laud -for
agricul tu re and prevent erosion.
Thus he maintains the farm land
and prolougs the decreasing forest.
