GERMAN NOTE IN
DETAIL ON PAGE 2
lJerlin. May 5. Germany has yield
ed practically every demand made by
President Wilson in his note demand
ing a complete change of Germany's
methods of submarine warfare, it is
conceded in Germany's reply, made
public here today.
livery possibility of a diplomatic
break between the two countries has
apparently been averted. j
Germany's complete backdown,
however, is made conditional on the
success of efforts it urges the TTnited
States to make to force Great Britain
to observe fully the principles of in
ternational law.
'Should the steps taken by the gov
ernment of the United States (to force
England to alter her conduct of warj
nut attain the object it desires to
have the laws of humanity followed
by the belligerent nations the Ger
man government would then be facing
a new situation in which it must re
serve for itself complete liberty of de
cision," said the concluding paragraph
of the reply.
Sink None Without Warning.
Germany concedes fully President
Wilson s contention that in the future
no merchant vettsel. whether freight
or passenger shall be sunk without
warning either within or without the
war zone around the British Isles, un
less they offer resistance or attempt
escape. President Wilson already had
conceded the right of submarines to
sink ships under such conditions.
German submarine commanders al
ready have received new orders meet
ing in full the demands made by Pres
ident Wilson. The German govern
ment expresses complete confidence
tbat these orders will be executed in
good faith by German submarine com
manders. Germany refuses to admit responsi
bility for the damaging of the channel
liner Sussex but declares that, should
further investigation show the Sussex
was a submarine victim, Germany will
make full amends.
Berlin Culls It Back Down.
Germany's backdown is preceded by
n sharp arraignment of the United
States government. This arraignment
is based largely on the charge that
the United States has failed to brine
Great Britain to book for violations of
international law as outrageous as
those charged against Germany's
naval forces.
The text of the note was given out
for publication here today at the same
hour it was wirelessed to the United
States.
Cabinet Has Ijoiig; Session.
Washington, May 5.- In a session
of the cabinet which lasted nearly
two and a half hours. President Wil
son considered with his advisers the
unofficial text of the German reply to
the I nited States submarine demands.
At the etui of the meeting there was
no question the situation was viewed
with optimism.
NTo official announcement could be
expeced fn m the White House, it was
said, until the president received the
official text from Ambassador Gerard.
This began arriving in code by cable
today. it is coming very slowly and
will require from five to six hours to
decode.
The final decision of the president
is not expected, therefore, before late
tomorrow.
Keply Looks Good.
Cabinet members refused to discuss
the situation in any way. It was indi
cated, however, that there was : trong
hope of a satisfactory settlement
basd on the communication. It was
said no special session of the cabinet
will be necessary and Postmaster
Burleson said he was going fishing.
The president himself read the note
to the meeting and a long and earnest
discussion of its contents followed.
Sudden Change Confusing.
Within ten minutes after the final
and vital paragraph of the Ger
man reply to America's submarine
warfare demands had reached Wash-

(Germany acquiesces in American demand for strict obser

Intimates if America unable to obtain such pledges from

Bitterly assails Great Britain for repeated violation of laws

Declares German people have been under the impression
that, while America threatens Germany with a break in rela

storff. the German ambassador, left
for Washington today on a 1 o'clock
train after having received by wire
less telegraph at his hotel here the
text of the German note. The ambas
sador denied himself to interviewers.
It is known, however, that the Ger
man embassy view is that the note is
all for which the United States asked:
that it signalizes a return to what has
been termed "cruiser warfare" that
is. the operation of submarines as
cruiser intercepting commerce with
visit and search.
The embassy view is that inasmuch
as no mention was made in the note
of the question of armament it is not
a complicating feature.
The recent declaration of the state
department on the status of armed
merchantships touches upon this
point. It held:

warship to determine the status of an

ington, President Wilson and his cab

tion. Cabinet members had been getting
the reply piecemeal from the press tel
egraph wires. They went into confer
ence with one awuarent thought Ger
many nas conceded the demands or
the United States but there was some
show of uncertainty because of the
conditions made.
The sudden transition in the Ger
man note from its sarcastic and con
temptuous tone belittling the United
States attitude. to flat statements
that met practically all the concessions
called for by this government, left
cabinet members somewhat confused.
The fact that Germany requires
Great Britain to cease operations
which she terms contrary to interna
tional law was expected, but at first
officials were inclined to accept Ger
many's request that this government
undertake to bring about such a
change as justifiable. It was pointed
out that Germany has issued the or

I believe Germany aprain has "passed

successful settlement of the present

America's attitude toward Great Brit

is concerned, officials are inclined to
pass over certain caustic and irrele

EDITORIAL COMMENTS
ON GERMANY'S REPLY
ATCHISON GLOBE More notes,
more complications, more Intensified
bitterness against tlie L'nited States.
We should have maintained a bands
off policy and should have warned
Americans to remain at home. The
l'nited States unprepared and unwill
ing, cannot compel the belligerents to
observe the international rules and it
cannot consistently maintain neutrality
without insisting that all belligerents
adhere to all the acknowledged prin
ciples of warfare. Great Britain-will
not abandon her blockade.
TIMES, St. Louis The severance of
diplomatic relations begins to look re
mote after a hurried review of the note.
While the first part of the (rerman an
swer may be termed sarcastic and
ironical, the latter paragraphs would
indicate a complete concession.
THE STAR. St. Lonis Absolute ces
sation of unwarned attacks upon mer
chant ships, either neutral or belliger
ent, was demanded by President Wil
son or severance of diplomatic relations
would follow. Germany refuses to
cease.
NEW YORK EVENING RUN We
cordially hope our government may
find in this note the solution of our
difficulty but as a general indication as
respects the prospects of peace, it fills
us with gloom. Plainly Germany is
not in the humor yet to heed the coun
sels of humanity. . Sue is still world
defiant.
NEW YORK G LOBE The reply Is
thus not to be accepted as a settlement
of the matters in dispute. There is no
compliance or subMtantial compliance.
No choice woutd thus seem open to our
government but to carry out Its de
clared intention to sever diplomatic
relations.
BUFFALO TIMES The controversy
cannot be' made conditional on any
thing which Great Britain may or may
not do.
BUFFALO COMMERCIAL The in
evitable has come. The United States
will be forced to break diplomatic re
lations that have subsisted with Ger
many. There must be no more note
writing; no more negotiations.
THE CLEVELAND WAKCHTER
AND ANZEIGER The German answer
is that of the strong, whose conscience
i dear, who wislie peace without
fearing war. The decision should be
simple.
8T. JOSEPH NEWS PRESS The
German reply to Prenident Wilson's
practical ultimatum in the matter of the
humane conduct of submarine warfare
must not be too hastily construed as
a denial of the American demands, be
cause of the condition apparently at
tached thereto; on the contrary, the
new order Issued to the submarine
commanders is in direct compliance
with those demands, provided that
there is to be no quibbling about what
is a merchant ship. If we may assume
that those orders are now sincerely
in effect and the conduct of German
submarine warfare Is now in earnest
accordance therewith, for the present
at least, the America a demand has been
complied with. So long as they remain
in effect there will be no issue.

SHE ASKSDIVORCE
Mrs. Marco Morrow Charges
Extreme Cruelty.
Wants Separation From Cap
per Advertising Director.
Mrs. Bess P. Morrow, wife of Marco
Morrow, director of advertising for
the Capper Publications, has started
divorce proceedings in the district
court. The petition was filed by C. E.
Gault and D. R. Hite, attorneys, just
before the office of the clerk closed
last night.
Mrs. Morrow's petition does not cite
specific ground for divorce. It charges
extreme cruelty on the part of the de
fendant and alleges that this consisted
of improper, abusive and profane lan
guage "causing the plaintiff great
mental suffering and trouble."
The word alimony does not appear
in the petition but Mrs. Morrow cites
that her husband earns a "consider
able income" and is well able to pay
a reasonable sum for her support.
The petition says "that she and the
defendant were married several years
ago and ever since said marriage have
been and are now husband and wife;
that the plaintiff has always conduct
ed herself as a faithful and dutiful
wife towards the defendant, but that
the defendant, disregarding his duty,
has treated the plaintiff with extreme
crueltv. in this, that for a consider
able length of time the defendant has
addressed to the plaintiff improper,
abusive and profane language in tones
of anger, without justification or
cause, and thereby caused the plaintiff
great mental suffering and trouble.
That the defendant is earning a con
siderable iome and is well able to
pay the plai&tiff a reasonable sum for
her support.
"Wherefore, the plaintiff prays that
upon final hearing this court enter a
judgment dissolving the marriage of
the plaintiff -and the defendant and
making such provision for plaintiff's
support as may be proper."

London, May 5. The Norwegian

a German cruiser, says a dispatch from
Copenhagen, to the Exchange Tele
graph company. The crew was saved.
General Scandinavian opinion, the
dispatch adds, is that German sub
marine warfare against merchant
shipping is on the wane. This method
of warfare is held to be responsible
for the great rise in the price of

Want Lane Enjoined From

strain the secretary from approving
leases for Indian oil lands signed re
cently by Osage chiefs, 'was set for
hearing in the United States district
court here today.
The secretary in his answer to the
suit, denies the interior department
exercised undue influence over the
trial council In signing the leases.
Members of the tribe charge that
oil operators who are obtaining the
new leases are getting them for a
fraction of their value. The leases,
have to be approved by the secretary.

Paris, May 5. The French suc
cesses on the jeft bank of the Meuse
have been of greater importance than
indicated by first reports, according to
a semi-official statement issued last
night.
The French troops, by skillful and
brilliantly executed operation have
thrown the Germans on the northwest
side of Deadman Hill beyond the line
held at the beginning of March. The
enemy has thus lost by a single stroke
his gains painfully made by two
months of continuous, costly attacks.
The Germans, surprised by the sud
den French attack, were thrown back
in disorder and suffered exceptionally
heavy losses, particularly from the
preliminary bombardment.
The large number of Germans
killed explains why ao few prisoners

Washington, May 6. Indications
today wore that representatives of the
United States and the Mexican de

last conference at El Paso, would re
port a final agreement on the prob

itary expedition into Mexico.
General Scott had the ratification by
