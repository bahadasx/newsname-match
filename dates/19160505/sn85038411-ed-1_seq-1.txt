By Associated / .
Washington, 15. May Presi
dent Wilson and the Cabinet went
carefully over the German note us
transmitted In news dispatches from
Berlin.
A first feeling th.it it was unsatis
factory was somewhat leavened by the
text of the new orders to submarine
commanders, although it was foreseen
that the reference to immunity for
JK "merchant ships recognized by inter
* national law" might admit of some l
dispute of interpretation.
So much depends upon words and
their shades of meaning; involved in
translation from German to English
that no decision can lie attempted until
the official text is in the President'.-
hands.
Ambassador Gerard cabled to-day ■
that he had started it on the cables
last night. It ought to be in Washing
ton to-night or early to-morrow.
Views Are Conflicting
Two > iews were current in olli
rlal circle.-. One was that Ger
many has declared her intention
of abandoning licr "present
methods of submarine warfare"
as demanded by the President and
tliftt the American government
might have to wait to sec whether
the abandonment would be
affected.
The other was that the I'nited
States. lia\ing already attempted
to have Germany give up its inter

Berlin Declares in Note
Berlin, May 5 (By Wireless, via Sayville, L. I.) Following Is the
text to the American note respecting submarine warfare, delivered on
Thursday by Gottlieb Von Jagow, the foreign secretary to Ambassador
Gerard:
' The undersigned, on behalf of the Imperial German government has
the honor to present to His Excellency, the Ambassador of the United
Slates. Mr. James \V. Gerard, the following reply to the note of April 20,
regarding the conduct of German submarine warfare.
"The German government handed 11
over to the proper naval authorities i
for early investigation the evidence \
concerning tlie Sussex as conimuni- i
cated by the government of the United
States. Judging by the results that i
the investigation has hitherto yielded, t'
the German government is alive top
the possibility that the ship men-' i
tioned in the note of April 10 as hav- ! \
ing lieen torpedoed by a German sub- i
marine is actually identical with the :
Sussex.
"The German government l>cgs to
reserve further communication on :
the matter until certain points are
ascertained, which are of decisive im
portance for establishing the facts of
the case. Should il turn out thai the
commander was wrong in assuming
• lie vessel to be a man-of-war, the
German government will not fail to <
draw the consequence resulting ilicrc
from.
Repudiates Assertions
"In connection with the case of the
Sussex the government of the I'nitcd

the gist of which is the assertion that

"Tile (iernian government must
emphatically repudiate the assertion.
'l'lie German government however,
tliinks it of little avail to enter into
details in the present stage of affairs,
more particularly a> the government
of the United States omitted to
substantiate the assertion l>y reference
to concrete facts.
"The German government will only
state that It has imposed far-reaching
restraints upon thf> use of the sub
marine weapon, solely in considera

the fact that these restrictions are
necessarily of advantage to Germany's
enemies. Xo such consideration has
ever been shown neutrals by Great

CONSTABLE AND
MURDERERS IN
RUNNING FIGHT
Slayers Chased Through Hum
melstown. Exchange Fire
With Officer
After killing Stanko Vicknovich. aged
36, alias Tom Rohicli, who came to
Annvllle four days ago from Middle
-1 town in search of work, two Italians
! whose identity is unknown, fled last
' evening, It is believed, to Humniels
' town. The body was f"Und near the
quarries of the Annville Limestone
j Products Company.
Early this, morning two men were
seen by Constable Robert Lower, of
l Hummelstown, near Main and Early
i streets. He called to them to stop and
| then chased them through the town,
j the men firing at the officer, who re
! turned the shots, but the fugitives es
caped.
Coroner' John J. Light, of Lebanon
and other county authorities are in
vestigating the murder. Vicknovich
was sitting outside the shanty of Mike
Mutch, near Annville. when the Italians
| passed. The men exchanged words,
jand one of them returned and started a
i tight. Later his companion came to his
aid and shot Vicknovich in the stom
ach.
Several hours after the two men were
chased through Hummelstown and sep
arated—one going toward Middletown,
the other toward tlie Walton quarries—
two foreigners arrived at Swatara sta
tion. and offered any amount of money,
it is said, to hire an automobile to take
j them to Reading or to Philadelphia.
I Both appeared to be nervous and acted
I suspiciously and when they could not
hire a machine left. No arrests have
| been made, but it was learned that no
I foreigners are missing at anv of the
i stone quarries in the county, and it is
| believed that tlie men were strangers
here.

'
Court-Martial Commutes Death
Sentence of Fifteen to
Penal Servitude
By Associated Press
Dublin, May 5. Four more rebel
prisoners were sentenced to death by
; court-martini and shot this morning.

| men were Joseph Plunkett, Edward

| and shot to death by order of the,
British government in Dublin Thurs
| day, was one of the seven original
I signers of the proclamation of the
Irish provisional government. When
Patrick H. Pearse, provisional presi
dent, and Thomas J. Clark and
Thomas MacDonagh met a similar
fate, it was announced in cable dis- ■
patches that of the remaining four
signers of the proclamation, Plunkett
i and James Connolly were in prison
j and Jean MacDiarmad and E. Ceanntl
had not been accounted for. Mac- I
i Diarmad, who ts a cripple and in
feeble health, Ceannt and James Con- i
. noily .are apparently still alive.

| Catholic branch of the famous Irish
family of that name.
William Pearse was a brother of
Patrick H. Pearse. He was a sculptor
and was once a tutor in the Irish
Boys School of which his brother was
headmaster.

han, among the rebels killed yester
! day, have not played prominent roles
lin the revolutionary movement, so
far as cable dispatches indicated.
