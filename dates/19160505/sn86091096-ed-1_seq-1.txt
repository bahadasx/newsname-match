SAFE CRACKED
JTJUUAETTA
Peoples Store Robbed of
$50 in Cash.
The safe in the People's store at
Juliaetta was blown up Sunday
morning at three o'clock. Fifty
^follars in cash was taken but noth
i jhg else in the safe was disturbed.
The cash register contained $16,
but this was evidently over-looked
by the robbers.
Within one hour after the safe of
the store was blown, Sheriff Camp
bell and Deputy Sheriff Hall were
in an auto speeding for Juliaetta,
but before their arrival the culprits
had made their escape, leaving
nothing but foot tracks as a clue.
The officers worked all day Sunday
and returned home at an early hour
Monday morning, unsuccessful in
their efforts. They spread the
alarm, however, which is believed
to have resulted in the capture of
the robbers.
The robbers gained admittance to
the store by breaking a window in
the door and then forcing the lock
from the inside. The door of the
safe was shattered.
W. B. Robinson, a son of Deputy
Sheriff Robinson, heard the report
as the safe was blown. Not having
a gun in his possession, he immedi
ately telephoned to the sheriff's
office. In the meantime the robbers
made quick work and left town be
fore Robinson could summon others.
The robbers are believed to be the
same implicated in the postoffice
robbery at this place.
Three men were placed under
arrest at Arrow junction Monday
afternoon and for a while it was be
lieved that they were implicated in
the robbery but they were later set
at liberty as no evidence could be
found against them.
Friday's Baseball Benefit
The baseball game, moving pic
ture show, basket social and dance
last Friday netted the baseball as
sociation about $36. There were
very few people in from the country
owing to the fact that the farmers
are so busy getting their crops in.
The movies were scheduled to be
run by electricity but one of the
motors belonging to the Potlatch
Electric Co. had not been "tuned
up," so the management had to fall
back on the gas.
After the picture show the hall
was brilliantly lighted with electric
lights. Mr. Barnum has had the
hall papered and painted on the
inside and it presented a very neat
appearance.
A good crowd stayed for the
dance and reported a jolly good
time.
H. P. Hull Sells Store
• C. G. Compton & Son purchased
H. P. Hull stock of general
merchandise. The deal was closed
the first of this month and the new
firm has taken possession. They
will run an up-to-date store and
will keep a fresh stock of goods on
hand. Stewart has had quite a bit
of experience in the store business
and the success of the business is
assured.
Mr. Hull's health has not been
very good for a number of years
so he will retire from active busi
ness. He will, however, maintain
an office in the room formerly oc
cupied by J. F. Brown. Mr. Hull
has been in business in Ken
drick for over twenty-five years.
Rev. Dr. Smith and Mrs. Smith
were calling in the Pine Creek
neighborhood last Monday. They
report a good time.

ROCK CRUSHER
S IN KENDRICK
F. A. Wallace Has Charge
of Machine.
F. A. Wallace, the silo man, went
to Moscow last week and brought
one of the county rock crushers to
Kendrick. The crusher was hauled
overland with George Clem's en
gine.
Mr. Wallace will use the crusher
to make crushed rock for the Ken
drick Rochdale elevator. He has it
set up on the vacant lots south of
N. E. Walker's residence and will
use the loose stone in the hill-side
for material to supply the machine.
He has a contract to furnish
about sixty thousand yards of
gravel to be used in concrete in the
erection of the elevator. After he
has completed this contract he has
made arrangements with the county
commissioners to run the machine
for them in case they wish to use it
to supply crushed rock for the
county roads. He will also do a
large amount of contract concrete
work in building sidewalks and
silos.
Juliaetta Wins Ball Game
Juliaetta again took Kendrick
into camp last Friday afternoon
with a score of seven to six. Both
teams made a number of errors,
due to a lack of practice.
Thomas pitched the first six inn
ings and allowed but one hit.
Hill finished the game and with
proper support could have easily
held the visitors to a no-run game
Forrest caught his usual steady
game.
Kendrick has the material for a
fast team but many of the players
haven't time to practice and are
not sure at the bat or in the field.
If three ©venings a week might be
devoted to good hard practice a
much better showing could be made.
However, it isn't all in winning a
game and , a few defeats will not
discourage the boys.
The line-up of the two teams was
as follows: A. Carlson, c., Robinson,
p., Miller, 1. b., Talbott, 2nd. b.,
Carlson, s. s., Ashton, 3rd. b.,
Compton, 1. f., Irvin, c. f., Sartain,
r. f. Kendrick; Forrest, c., Tho

LAPWAI INDIANS
DEFEAHENDRICK
Fast Game Played on Local
Diamond Wednesday.
Kendrick was again defeated in
a baseball game played on the
home grounds Wednesday afternoon.
The Lapwai Indians were too fast
for us but it was a good game just
the same. The score was 8 to 5,
Most of the scores were made on
errors as the Indians failed to get
many hits off either Hill or Thomas.
Our pitching staff is going good
this spring but the infield needs
practice badly.
Practically the same men played
against the Indians that played in
the game with Juliaetta with the
exception of Stuart Compton in the
right field. Jones played first base,
Wegner in left field and McCon
aughy second base.
Manager Barnum is doing his
part toward putting out a baseball
team but the players and some of
the business men are not doing
their part in supporting the team.
The players, even if they are busy,
can find a little time for practice
and the business men ought to turn
out to the games and help out
financially. No one can question
the fact that a ball team is a good
thing for a town. Tne business
men may not reap much of a . har
vest in a financial way but the ball
team is an asset as an advertisement
that should not be over-looked.
Let's hope that everybody will turn
out to the next game.

Kids Take Joy Ride
Seventy-two children reported at
the Kendrick Auto Company's gar
age Saturday evening in response
to the invitation extended by Guy

cars to accomodate the crowd.
After their ride Mr. and Mrs.
Lewis treated the children to ice
cream at Robert's.
J. W. Lieuallen a well known
Moscow citizen, died at his home
Wednesday of heart failure. A few
minutes previous to his death he
was apparently in good health.

spector, was in town. He made
the statement that if the state
sanitary laws were not carried out
by the time he made his next visit
there would be something doing

PURCHASE CULTURES
FROMJJNIVERSITY
Ten Cents Per Acre To In
oculate Seed.
Recently a salesman, represent
ing a concern which is marketing a
culture for the inoculation of le
gumes at the rate of $2.00 per acre,
requested me to recommend to the
farmers of our state to give his cul
tures a trial, notwithstanding we
were offering a dependable culture
for the same purpose at the nominal
price of 10 cents per acre. This
function of the Department of
Bacteriology was undertaken as an
addition to the service which the
Experiment Station is endeavoring
to render to the state, and has been
continued in the belief that such
service has been both economical
and efficient.
The department is informed on
the work which has hitherto been
done along the line of legume in
oculation, and is in touch with the
various concerns which are at pre
sent distributing cultures. The
subject of legume inoculation is one
which should receive your earnest
attention, and the Director of the
Experiment Station, either directly
or through his staff, will be pleased
to offer such information as is de
sired.

NODULES ARE PRODUCED ON
THE ROOTS OF LEGUMES
Recent letters to the Department
of Bacteriology indicate that there
is some uncertainty as to what
plants are nodular. Certain plants
which bear pods and have the
peculiar flower of the pea and bean
such as the clovers, vetches, and
alfalfa, are called legumes. It is
upon the roots of these plants only
that, under normal conditions
nodules are produced by the action
of certain bacteria which have
become associated with the plants
and which might be styled "bene
ficial parasites."
The bacteria which produce no
dules are parasites because they
obtain much of their food from
the sap of the plant and they are
beneficial because they can derive
the necessary supply of nitrogen
from the air and pass it on to the
plant in a usable form. This is
the reason why the nodular legumes
are such valuable crops to grow in
rotation with crops like wheat, oats
and corn, which are great consumers
of nitrates.
Where no nodules are produced
; on the legumes, it follows that
nitrogen is not added to the soil
| The absence 0 f nodules on the roots

by addressing the Department of
Bacteriology, Moscow, Idaho. These
cultures are furnished for the ino
1 cu l a tion of seed at the rate of ten
cents an acre for the following
legumes: Field, garden, and sweet
peas; field, garden, horse, and soy

clovers; and vetch and alfalfa,
