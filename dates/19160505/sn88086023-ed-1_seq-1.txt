Nature of Reply to American
Demands Leaves Cabinet and
President Somewhat Confused
Communication is Considered Immediately Af
ter Received But no Action is Expected Until
the Official Text Has Been Cabled From
Berlin; America's Attitude Toward England is
Now Greatest Point in Settlement of Sub
marine Trouble.
WASHINGTON. May 5. Although
the cabinet met thla morning to dis
cuss the German note, no action was
expected until the offllal text haa been
cabled, probably tomorrow.
Within 10 minutes after the note
reached Washington, the president
and cabinet met to consider the com
munication The reply came In piece
meal from the wires. The conference
apparently was unanimously of the
belief that Germany had conceded to
the demands, but some uncertainty
existed because of the conditions that
were made.
The first part of the note was con
sidered of a sarcastic and contentious
tone, belittling the American attitude.
Then cume the flat statements meet
ing practically all the concessions de
manded It left the cabinet officers
somewhat confused. The fact that
Oermnny requires England to cease
Its operations in violation of Interna
tional law was expected. Many offi
cials were Inclined to request America
to undertake to bring about such
change. Some believed that Germany
again "passed the buck" to America.
The nature of the reply puts Am
erica on probation, making a success
ful settlement of the present difficulty
entirely dependent upon America's at-1 morrow after the official note Is de
tltude toward England. Officials were , llvered. Cabinet members refused to
Inclined to pass over the caustic and comment.
