Dear Sir:
In your issue of April 28 appeared an
editorial bitterly asaailing the democratic
members of the board of supervisors and
their alleged allies. The article, I con
sider, outrageousl unfair and I am go
ing to ask you to publish the facts about
the recent bo-ird meeting as one of those
accused democrats viewed it.
As you do oot claim inure was any
thing wrong Ic electing a democrat as
chairman we will not take up any space
in explaining how or why that was done.
As to the action of the board on the

Mrs. Uabt'lle Brown pMied IWfty at herhom'
tour mi let south of Lawrence last Tuesday morn
ing, May 2. She suffered a stroke of apoplexy on
Wednesday, April 20, and never regained con
sciousness. All that medical skill and loving
hands could do was of no avail, and she gradually
and peacefully slept her life away.
Isabelle Brown was the eldest of a family of
seven children born to Mr. and Mrs. James Bray
brooks. She was born in England on August 18,
1847, and came to America with her mother when
three years of age, her father having preceded
them. They settled first at Monroeville, Ohio,
where they remained two years, then moving to
Lawrence township, which has since been her
home.
At the age of 21 she was married to Nathan
B. Wakeman, who died January 19, 1901. Seven
children were born to them, all of whom suivive:
P. N. Wakeman of Paw Paw; Mrs. A. H. Abrams,
Mrs. C. J. Rowley, Mrs. A. E. Abrams and Mrs.
Will Nower. Jr., Lawrence; Mrs, Ervin D. Moore
and Mrs. Corliss Stickney, Hillsdale. The chil
dren were all at her bedside.
On July 2, 1904, she was again married to James
H. Brown of Lawrence, who with the children and
two sisters and three brothers are left to mourn her.
She was a most devoted mother and wife, and was
happy when doing something for those she loved.
She loved to have the children around her and
the memory of many happy family gatherings and
the days spent with mother will always linger in
the minds of the loved ones she has left.
Sh was ; member of the M. E. church at
Lawrence, the O E. S. and the L. O. T. M. M.
The funeral is to be held from the home to
day (KVidayy at 1:30 p. m. Rev. Mr. Harris of
Lawrence will officiate, and loving hands will ten
derly lay her to rest on the family lot in Prospect
Lake cemetery.

SCOPE OF CHURCH
At a conference held Sunday evening
in tne parlors of tbe Presbyterian church
a significant discussion of tbe Sunday
evening service was conducted by tne
pastor with a representative group of
his congregation. Plans were formu
lated for a re-opening of the Sunday
servioe on a larger scale than has been
attempted in recent years. There waa
an evident desire in this discussion tu
make the church minister to the com
munity in tbe largest and widest possi
ble way. Tbe church does not exist to
be ministered unto by tbe community
but it stands aa the servant of tbe com
munity. It was felt that the Sunday
evening service offers a wide opportunity
for community helpfulness. Tbe service
will be made as attractive as possible
with music by a chorus choir, appro
priate preaching and a most cordial wel
come, roe general public not amuated
with any other church is cordially in
vited to these and all other service of
the church.
