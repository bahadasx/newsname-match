A large audience of about 300 at
tended the mus'cal entertainment
given by the pupils of the convent
school Thursday, April 27. The pro
gram consisted of piano solos.duets,
trios and quatuors which were ren
dered in a manner which speaks
very highly of the pupils and their
instructors. The Brighton Broom
Brigade, a drill by sixteen boys, ac
companied by a military marc'i
played by E. Turgeon and T. Guer
tin was a pleasing number of the
program. Special mention must be
made of "The Little Maids of Tim
buctoo," an action song by seven
little girls, Clara Parent, Bernadine
Stevens, Muriel Barrett, Leonie Du
four, Irene' Robin, Mabel and May
Haddad. accompanied by Margaret
May Maroney. The little girls were
daintily dressed in white, wearing
red, white and blue sashes, and car
ried fans and parasols of he same
color. This number was encored to
a great extent and the audience
were somewhat disappointed that
time would not permit the little
girls to sing their song again. The
pantomime, a drill and tableau by
twelve girls carrying Easter lilies
and dressed in long white robes, the
last tableau of which was illuminat
ed by red fuses at each end of ' the
stage making it a very fitting num
ber for the close of the program.
The school realized the profits from
a sale of 3(50 tickets.
For streets that were cleaned one
day last week ours at the present
time are in a sad condition. The
high wind Tuesday showed us the
conditions of the back yards in to Am.
Refuse during the winter months
has been dumped in the back yards
and been allowed to stay up to the
present time, This is not only un
sightly but unhealthy. Little good
does it do to clean the main thor.
oughfares if this refuse is left stand
ing to be distributed over the streets
by winds. Not only does this refuse
and paper come from the back' yards
but from people who have little or
no public spirit and civic pride in
our community: We have observed
people receiving mail matter, per
haps in circular advertising form,
and calmly walk out of the post
office and throw it into the street.
We realize and also receive much of
this cheap advertising in our own
mail, but the point that we wish to
get at is that it would be just as con
venient for people to place this mat
ter in their pockets and destroy it or
, burn it on their arrival home, and
I thus save such an unsightly condi-
I tion as that which prevails in and
! i i-m,. i .. i.
ago a large number !' the men of
Island Pond met and appointed a
clean-up committee. Up to the
present time we have heard nothing
from them in the line of clean-up

be from May 1st to May loth. In
any state paper we mav pick up we
can readily see w'jat other towns
and villages are doing along these
lines. The town expects some time
in August to celebrate an Old Home
Week and Chautauqua and we, think
there is no better time than the pres
ent to paint up and clean up for this
event.
Clean-Up Week.
Once again let us remember that
this is "Clean-Up Week" and ihat it
is the duty of each and every family
to see that their yards, both front
and back are free from anything
that may be dangerous to public
health or a source of annoyance to
their neighbors' sense of smell or
sight. Let us be particularly careful
this year to "clean up" so that when
our city cousins visit us later in the
season there will be no cause for
complaint of the uiiSanitary condi
tion of our town. See that this is
done before the health officer comes
around.
