Dewey Carder 'committed suicide
near his mother's ranch in the north
end of Plttman Valley last Thursday
night, by shooting himself through
the head with a rifle. The bullet en
tered his head under his left car and
practically toro the top of his head
off. The rifle was a 30-30 calibre
and a soft nosed bullet was used.
Carder was only 19 years of age,
and a brother of Harry Carder of
this city. His father died only a few
weeks ago.
Young Carder was charged with
having killed a calf that did not be
long to him and a warrant was sworn
out for his arrest. He had been hid
ing out for several days around the
country in the vicinity of the ranch.
On Thursday night Deputy Sheriff
Smith with his brother, run across
him carrying a rifle and asked him to
surrender. He was under a tree and
out of sight; they fired a shot to
frighten him into giving up. Shortly
afterwards they heard a shot and
called to him but received no re
sponse; getting up closer, they saw
him lying on the ground and when
they reached him he was dead.
Either in his excitement and fear
of arrest, or by accidently drawing
his rifle up toward him while laying
on the ground, his death occurred.
The fear of arrest may have caused
him to commit suicide. He was found
laying on his face dead, with the rifle
clasped in his arms. Powder burns
showed conclusively that it was the
discharge of his own rifle that ended
his life.
A coroner's jUry was empaneled by
Judge Twitty of Williams, who re
turned a verdict of suicide.
It is a very sad case and very
probable, that, as it was his first
trouble and young in years, he be
lieved It much more serious than it
actually was. His early youth was
spent in Flagstaff where he was well
known by the younger generation.
Jo Conners Boosts Oatman
"The Goddess of Fortune has al
t .ovays been kind to Coconino county
and the fickle jade has been especially
so to the people of the county who
have invested in Oatman mining
stock," said Jo Conners, newspaper
man and publicity agent who spent
the day in Flagstaff Thursday. Amal
gamated was financed practically with
Coconino county money and those
who have the stock can rest assured
of big returns on their money. Oat
man Amalgamated is owned and con
trolled by men who know the mining
business in all its phases. J. T.
Burns who financed the property did
it so thoroughly that there was never
any hitch after the development once
started, and they have gotten results.
Superintendent Jack Lamb is one of
the most capable and efficient mining
men in the southwest and having had
free rein and not being handicapped
for want of funds he has made a
wonderful showing and already a big
ledge of ore worth between $3 and $4
has been uncovered.
Polfcc Court Business Picking Up
During the past month the city
police court has been doing a good
business. Judge Layton advises that
during the past thirty days thirty
cases of drunk and disorderlies have
been up for trial. There is a large
falling off in the drink line.
A Truly Ancient Newspaper
Mrs. Harry Wiltse has a copy of
the Ulster Countv (N. Y) Gazette
dated January 1800, which gives an
account of the death of George Wash
ington, December 14th, 1799. The
paper has .been handed clown in her
family from generation to generation
and is in a remarkable good state of
preservation, with the print as clear
as the day it was printed. The' spell
ing was the quaint old fashioned kind,
using the "f" for "s." It is a very
interesting document because of the
kind of news, peculiar advertisements
and general make up.
Brings Home Novia Scotia Bride
Ike Smith, the well known black -S
smith at the A. L. & T. mill returned
Sunday from Nova Scotia with a
bride. He went to his old home at
Stewiacke. N. S., to see his brother
who is a major in a regiment soon to
leave for the front on the side of the
allies and during his stay aided the
1 United States bv taking unto himself
I n charming bride who was formerly
Miss Lockhart. Mr. Smith is a native
of Nova Scotia but has been a resi
dent of Flagstaff for the past eleven
years. A number of his best friends
gave him a heartv welcome on his re
turn. They' will make their home In
Milton.

KILLED BY A TRAIN
WHILE ON HIS WAY HOME
A young man walking along
the track early Friday morning
about four miles west of Flag
staff, was struck by No. 2 and
almost instantly killed.
' It is almost impossible to ac
count for the accident accept
that he was cither deaf or
thought he was oft" the enst
bond track, as there was only
one train on the track at the
time. Before anyone could reach
him after he was hit, he was
dead. The train, coming down
grade threw him from the track,
mangled one leg and crushed in
the back of his head. He was
brought into FlagstafT by the
train.
From papers, a bankbook
found on his person anil tele
graphic inquiries, it was learned
that his name was A. B. C. Did
zun, a lawyer In the partnership
concern of Murray & Didzun of
San Antonio, Texas. He had
shipped his baggage by express
from some town near Redlands,
Calif., to Texas, and evidently,
because of straightened circum
stances, was making his way
back the best he could.
He was a fine looking man,
evidently about 30 years of age.
A coroner's jury was empaneled
by Judge Harrington Friday and
from all the evidence brought
before them, returned a verdict c
of accidental death. '
The remains of the unfortun- c
ate man were taken to his old
home at Waco.Tcx.. by a brother
who arrived in FlagstafT a day
after the accident

VOTERS VERY UNKINDLY
TOWARD BOIDJOND ISSUE
The proposed good road bond issue
of $250,000 was overwhelmingly de
feated Tuesday by the voters. There
was hardly a precinct heard from thnt
did not help to snow It under at the
rate of over two to one.
The vote in the two Flagstaff prc
tincts gave a result of 99 against and
05 for the bonds.
1 Williams gave the proposition a
like swift kick with a vote of 99
against and 8 for the bonds.
' The vote was very light and no
! vote was taken at all in some pre
cincts. The proposition was so badly
defeated in Flagstaff and Williams
that the vote in the rest of the county
could not change the result.
! The question has been agitated pro
' and con for the past two years, and
1 now that the people have spoken, it
can rest quietly for a couple of years,

the shock of a fall.
Mrs. Sterns was born in Germany,

Flag. Wins From Lumberjacks
The Flagstaff ball team walloped
the Lumberjack team in the interest
ing ball game played last Sunday, by
a score of 6 to 8. Fred Hesser and
Fred Metz were the presenting and
receiving men for the Flag team and
they showed considerable executive
ability throughout the game. Our
baseball reporter was suffering with a
severe case of Ingrowing delapidation
of the heart, consequently, we failed
to get a full report of the game.
In the Senate of the United States April 25, 1916, Mr.
Ashurst Introduced the Following Bill; Which Was
Read Twice and Referred to the Committee
on Public Buildings and Ground
Flagstaff may yet get a govern
ment building for the housing of the
postoflicc and other government offl
cials here. The miserable conditions
here under which the local postofllce
officials arc laboring has at least
stirred up Senator Ashurst to intro
duce a bill in the senate to appro
priate $100,000 for a postoflice site
and building. There is already a bill
introduced In the house asking for an
appropriation of $10,000 for a post
office site: introduced some months
ago by Congressman Hayden. Noth
ing more has been heard of that bill
and it may he that- as this is a poli
tical year, Ine introduction of the bill
by Senator Ashurst, will die a similar
dca'h, however, if bills of this kind
are introduced from time to time,
there may come a, time when some
actual interest and action will be
taken in the matter by congress.
At the present l-itc of rrowth, the
Flagstaff office would pay for the
building and site in a few year?. Un
der existing conditions it is almost
impossible for the present force to
attend to the wants of the public and
it has caused a waive of disgust to
R. R. GROSSING PETITION
RECEIVES ATTENTION
Division Superintendent R. H. Tut
tle of Wlnslow, was in Flagstaff last
Friday and met with a committee of
the Woman's Club to confer relative
to a petition circulated by them ask
ing for protection at the railroad
crossings on Railroad avenue There
is a heavy traffic at two of the cross
ings and much switching is neces
sary along these two places during
the greater part of the day. Notice
that petitions of that character were
being circulated by the ladies,
brought a quick response from Supt.
Tuttle, who met with them to ascer
tain their attitude in the matter and
to Investigate the situation.
The action of the ladies in taking
the matter up directly with Mr. Tut
tle and his prompt response is evi
dence that the petition was in the na
ture of a "friendly complaint," with
a desire on the part of the Santa Fe
officials to find out where the blame
lay to correct it if it is possible to do
so
A short discusion of the question
brought about a very friendly feeling
on the part of the ladies and the
promise on the nart of Supt. Tuttle
that he would take the matter up im
mediately on the receipt of their pe
tition and present it to the proper
higher authorities with his recom
mendation, believing the crossing
question would be amicably settled.
Death of Joel Tillman Scott
Mr. Joel Tillman Scott, aged 68
years, died at his home in Milton,
Friday, April 28th, of Brights disease
after a brief a.cuto illness. He has

dreaded disease and death came last
Friday to relieve his suffering. Mr.
Scott was a native of Kentucky and
came to FlagstafT about three years
ago with his family and took up a
homestead in Mill Park. On account
of his illness he moved into Flagstaff

Robinson Robbed of Half His Hay
Jack Robinson came home from Camp
Verde the first of the week and when
he visited his ranch about five miles
south of Flagstaff, found that tnieves
had broken into his house and barn.
Out of 136 bales of hay he left there
last fall when he went south, only 76
remained for his use. The lock on the
door of his ranch house was broken
and the place ransacked, but he did
not miss anything from his affects.
Jack Is very much in hopes that the
thief, or thieves, whoever thev are,
will raise a good crop of hay of their
own this year and return what they
owe him.

alize they are compelled to stand for
the utter lsHc of proper accommoda-f
tions.
The full text of the bill as intro
duced by Senator Ashurst, is as fol
lows: A Bill to provide for the purchase
of a site and the erection of a build
ing thereon at the town of FlagstafT,
in the Stale of Arizona.
Be it enacted by the Senate and
House of Representatives of the

WHO WILL SERVE THE
CITY JSJOUNCILIN?
All evidence heretofore introduced,
to the contrary, Flagstaff will have a
City Council for the next two years.
Up to this time there has been few,
if any prominent citizens who had a
desire to take up the work of making
Flagstaff the "real city progressive
and beautiful," but the importance of
the work to be done the coming two
.ytJSW has at last awakened the spirit
of civic pride and some few have
volunteered for service.
t Among the different ideas that
have been advanced we hear of many j
who would like to continue the pre-'
sent city council in office, believing
, their past record warrants that action
.n the part of the public.
I Other mines have been mentioned (
also, with the belief if they would ,
serve the people, they would deliver
the goods. Tho.se mentioned during j
. the last few days that we have heard
of are: A. W. Bikkcr, Thomas Frier,
' J. C. Dolan, Sam Quay, John Clark, j
I Frank E. Brooks, P. J. Momn, T. A. 1
Rickel, Will Marlar. (
The meeting at the court house to-,
morrow night for the purpose of
naming a citizens ticket will probably I
produce more names of those who I
will be willing to serve the city offi-
e'Al'y. Thosa who arc settled upon
will have the advantage of a good
boost for the place to start with. ,
Good Booster Busted in Bad
O. H. John, the local representative
of the Santa Fe, is a genuine good
booster and a member of the Com
mercial Club which does considerable
business a.nd endeavors to keep things
sorter moving in the right direction.
Monday night he heard of a meeting,
also that they had changed the regu
lar place of meeting. He presented
himself at the city hall, and some one
advised him, "up stairs." He went
up stairs and made himself at home
talking upon different subjects until,
instead of John Francis taking the
chair, George Babbitt called the meet
ing to order. The question of a one
dollar membership fee was up.
"H !" said John, or something
like that, turning to Francis, "I
thought we had settled that question
and put the membreship fee at $5.
long ago."
"No, this is a meeting of the demo
cratic club and we are discussing
ways and means," replied Francis.
0. H. is just as sensitive about the
particular brand of politics he uses as
0. young lady is of face powder and
he is a republican. The door was
hardly wide enough, but he made it
and was down stairs in four long
steps. Then he remarked: "Can you
beat it? 1 DID."
Buys Williams Drug Store.
J. E. Rufiin purchased the D. A.
'Byrne dmg store at Williams Tues
day and took possession of the busi
ness the same day. The business is
an old established one doing a good
business. Rufiin at one time run a
drug store in Flagstaff, later Blsbee,
Phoenix and in Los Angeles.
ASSOCIATE FORESTER
- MEETS WITH COUNCIL
Associate Forester A. F. Pot
ter met with the City Council
last Wednesday evening, at
which meeting the question rela
tive to the plans of the Coconino
Water Development Co., in dev
eloping the water at Crater Lake
was taken up with a view of
ascertaining whether or not their
plans of development of water
in that vicinity would in any
way affect the water supply of
the city. Mr. Potter had gone
over the works of the Develop
ment company previous to the
meeting and was prepared to say
that in his opinion and from all
Indications there was no reason
why the Forest Service should
object to their operations. The
City Council, after being advised
of his investigation, agreed to
make no objection to the future
development. Mr. Potter also
assured the council that he would
recommend the granting of the
section north of the city reser
voir be set aside and stock ex
cluded therefrom to keep the
city water supply pure and to
protect it in the interest of the
people of FlagstafT.

INDIAN OFFICIALS VISIT
FLAGSTAFF SATURDAY
Superintendent John B. Brown of
the Phoenix Indian school, was in
Flagstaff Saturday, with Supt. Peter
son of the Apache Indian reservation.
Mr. Brown had been over to the
Apache reservation for a few days
on business and stopped over in Flag
staff to visit the Normal school. Mr.
Peterson was looking into the lumber
situation here and gathering data
which he hopes to use soon in hand
ling the great body of pine timber on
the Apache reservation. There is a
magnificent body of virgin timber in
that section of the country which
should be utalized. In order to secure
best results it will be necessary to
build a railroad into the country and
it looks as though the government
with many of their other extravagant
schemes, might a great deal better
put a railroad into the timber and
thus save a few million by selling
their logs to the big mills now in
operation.
At present the timber stands un
used, except for a small amount now
and then cut by the agency for local
use, the matured stuff dies, rots and
falls to the ground as a menace to
the rest of the young growing timber
from fires.
Elks Celebration Gains Headway
Elaborate arrangements are being
made for the entertainment of the
visitors to the big celebration July 3
and 4 in charge of the Elks Lodge.
It is the intention of the members in
charge to overlook nothing that will
go to make these two days the best
Flagstaff has ever witnessed.
Among the many concessions sec
ured for the coming event is a one
and one-third fare for the round trip
on all Santa Fe lines, tickets on sale
July 1st, with the return limit July
5th. This rate is expected to bring a
large number of visitors from neigh
boring towns and plans arc now pro
gressing to give them ample accom
modations. One big feature that has been de
finitely decided is a 25 mile automo
bile race on the track with a $300.00
purse. Mr. Chisholm with force of
teams has started work on the track
and will leave it in fine shape. The
track will be widened and heavily
banked on the curves.
1 Disastrous Fire at Winslow
The ' most disastrous fire of
years occurred at Winslow Monday
night. The entire Hunter lumber
yard went up in smoke. We were
unable to learn the origin of the fire
or whether there was any insurance
of the stock.
At last after many years of trials
and tribulations, street paving looms
large on the horizon and is now a
fact. Word has been received from
the California & Arizona Paving Co.,
through their agent Mr. Morton, who
is here this week that actual work of
paving will commence on May 10th,
that equipment and material will be
here as fast as required. The great
er number of the property owners
along the streets affected have al
ready signed up a contract with the
bithulitlc people; those who do not
will be compelled to pay a heavier
tax for the work as it includes the
cost of putting the law into affect.
The bithulitic is not a cheap paving,
but from best sources of information,
will prove the nest and most lasting
in this climate, if properly laid. The
proper laying of the paving, we un
derstand has been carefully , looked
into by the City Council, who are
thoroughly convinced that the work
will not be of a shoddy character.
The extremes of heat and cold at
this altitude necessitates a paving
material which will adapt itself to the
conditions. The bithulitic, according
to authorities, will give a more yield
ing surface, create less noise under
traffic and during the winter months
be less dangerous under ice and water
for both horses and autos.
With this light lowering and raising
of the grades in the different sections
of the down town district, a wonder
full improvement will be made in the
appearance of the whole city.
Prominent Albuquerque Citizen Here
Mr. R. E. Putney and wife of Al
huquerquc, were in Flagstaff Satur
day getting a view of the city and
its surroundings. Mr. Putney is the
big wholesale merchant of Albuquer
que with branch houses in different
parts of New Mexico and has estab
lished himself as far west as Hol
brook, where he has a growing busi
ness. Mr. Putney had nothing espe
cial to say as to the reason for his
trip to Fle.gstaff other than to look,
over the country and get acquainted
with the people in the interest of his
business at Holbrook. Incidentally,
he is one of the men who has helped
to make Albuquerque famous in many
ways, including the last state fair
pulled off in that citv
Cowpunchcr Seriously Injured
David Weaver, a well known cow
boy who has worked the passed year
with the "T bar" outfit for E. E.
Thurston, was kicked in the head by a
horse near Hancc Springs Sunday and
found unconscious a few hours later
and taken to Camp Verde for treat
ment. He had remained unconscious
until Tuesday, the last heard of him.
An examination of the wound showed
his injury a serious one, but not ne
cessarily fatal. He has .been working
with cattle in this i.ectlon for the past
ten years.

t known as "dourine," which is not only
, a very fatal disease, but one that is
very infectious.
I The disease has said to have spread
from the Indian reservation where
the government has been trying to
stamp it out for several months.
Mrs. A. E. Oister, a sister of C. J.
