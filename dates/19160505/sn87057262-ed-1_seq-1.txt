The early sections of the note
caused the feeling that Germany was
beclouding the issue with an ava
lanche of words, arguments and con
ditions.
This was forecast in a resume of
what the German reply was likely to
cover, sent to the state department
yesterday by Ambassador Oerard. Fol
lowing the receipt of that message
and a perusal of its somewhat garbled
paragraphs* t--wa» stated on highest
authority that "it is evident Germany
plans to attach so many conditions
to her reply that it cannot possibly
be acceptable to the United States."
Owing to the length of the German
reply it "will demand the most care
ful digest by the president and Sec
retary Lansing, it was said this morn
ing, before this government deter
mines upon a definite course of ac
tion. This action, it is declared, will
take one of two turns—either prompt
acceptance of the reply as satisfac-.
tory or prompt refusal as absolutely
unsatisfactory.
In the latter event, the president.
It is said, will without further ado
notify Germany that friendly relations
between the two nations are no long
er possible for the present.

How satisfactory these "conces

BERiUN, May 5. (Via wireless to
Sayville, L. I.)—The text of the Ger
man reply to President Wilson's sub
marining demands, as transmitted to
Ambassador Gerard of the United
States, last night by Foreign Secre
tary Von Jagow, follows:
IThe undersigned, on behalf of the
imperial German government, lias the
honor to present to his excellency,
the ambassador tx the United States,
Mr. James W. Gerard, the following
reply to the note of April 2*X re
garding the conduct of German sub
marine warfare:
1 Germany's R®ply.
The German- government handed
over to the proper naval authorities
for further investigation evidence
concerning the Sussex as communi
cated toy the government of the Unit
ed States. Judging by the results
that investigation hitherto yielded,
the German government is alive to
the possibility that the ship mention
ed in the note of April 10 as torped
oed 'by a German submarine is actu
ally identical with the Sussex. The
German government begs to reserve
further communications on the mat
ter untSl certain points are ascertain
ed which are of decisive importance
for establishing the facts of .the
case. Should it turn out that the
commander was wrong In assuming
the vessel to be a man of war, the
German government will not fail to
draw the eonsecjuences resulting
therefrom.
•In' connection with the case of the
Sussex the government of the United
SCateB 'made a series of statements,
the gist of which is the assertion that
the incident is to be considered but
one Instance for (evidently should
read "of) a deliberate method of
indiscriminate destruction of vessels
of ail sorts, nationalities and destin
ations by German submarine com
manders. The German government
must emphatically repudiate the as
sertion. The German government,
however, thinks it of little avail to
enter into the details in the present
stage of affairs, more particularly as
the government of the United States
omitted to substantiate the assertion
.by reference to concrete facts. The
-German government will only state
that It has Imposed far-reaohing re
straints upon the use of the sub
marine weapon solely In considera
tion of neutrals interests, in spite of
the fact that these restrictions neces
sarily were of advantage to Ger
many's enemies.

by Great Britain and her allies.
Mrt aiirh considera-'
German submarine forces have
had, in fact, orders to conduct sub
accordance with
marine warfare in accordancei witn
Errors Are. Unavoidable.
The German government cannot
admit any doubt that these orders
were given and are executed In good
faith. Errors actually occurred.
They can in no kind of warfare be
avoided altogether and allowances
must be made in the conduct of naval
warfare against an enemy resorting

man reply was published here.

In some respects the ambassador
-would not find a very receptive
attitude in the state department. If
his position is to toe that America has
"assumed the role of upholder of in

differently.
Frequent former rulings by Secre
tary Lansing were pointed to as sig
nificant. In the case of the torped

waa aboard. He was saved but his
life plainly was Jeopardised. Lans

government made several proposals
to the government of the United

warfare. Unfortunately the govern

to accept the proposals. Had it ac
cepted, the government of the United
States would have been instrumental
in preventing the greater part of the
accidents that American citizens
have met with in the meantime. The
German government still stands by
its offer to come to an agreement
along these lines.
As the German government has
repeatedly declared it cannot dis
pense with the use of submarines as
a weapon in the conduct of warfare
against enemy trade. The German
government, however, has now de
cided to make further concession,
adapting the methods/ of submarine
warfare to the interests of neutrals.
In reaching this decteton the German
government is actuated by consider
ations which are above the level of
the disputed question.

rights. The latest measure adopted
by &reat Britain declaring German
bunker coal contraband alone can be
supplied to neutrals, is nothing 'but
an unheard of attempt by way of
exaction to force neutral tonnage
into service and trade in war.
The German people know that the
government of the United States has
the power to confine the war to the
armed forces of the belligerent -coun
tries in the interest of humanity and
the maintenance of international
law. The government of the United
States would have been certain in at
taining this end had it been determ
ined to Insist against Great Britain
on the incontrovertible rights to the
freedom of the seas (evidently mean
ing "had it been determined to in

matters stand the German people is
under the impression that the gov

demanding that Germany, struggling
for existence, shall restrain the use
of an effective weapon and while
making compliance with these de
mands, a condition for the mainten
ance of relations with Germany,
confines itself to protests against the
illegal methods adopted by Germany's
enemies. Moreover, the German peo
ple knows to what a considerable ex
tent their enemies are supplied with
all kinds of war material from the
United States.
It will therefore toe understood
that the appeal made by the govern

In answer to the appeal by the

German government must repeat

the British government which by

hard but effective weapon of sub

Ready for Peace.
The German government, conscious
of Germany's strength, twice within
the last few months announced be
fore the world its readiness to make
peace on a -basis safeguarding Ger-
vital interests, thus indicat-
ing that it is not Germany's fault if
peace is still withheld from the na
tions of Europe. The German gov
ernment feels all the more Justified
to declare that responsibility could
not be borne before the forum of the
history of mankind, if after twenty
one months duration of the war, the
submarine questions under discussion
the government of the United States
were to take a turn seriously threat
ening the maintenance of peace be

As far as lies within the German
government, it wishes to prevent
things from taking such a -course.
