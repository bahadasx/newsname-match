Cooper, president of the police jury
of Jefferson Davis parish.
Address of John H. Cooper, Presi
(lent of the police jury, delivered at
Jennings, La., May 3, 1916, on the
occasion .of the laying of the corner
stone of Jefferson Davis Parish
court house.
While there is a great deal that
might be of interest in connection with
the early history of this territory, the
development of the country proper
ly began about thirty-five years ago.
In 1881 the first train on the Louisi
ana Western R. R. passed through
the territory now Jefferson Davis
parish and with the railroad came
land prospectors and home seekers.
At that time the only products of
the country were cattle, horses and a
few sheep. The popul:ation was al
most exclusively Creoles, the de
scendants of the Arcadians, who had
moved into this territory from the,
country further east for the purpose'
of raising stock and many of them
had acquired consi!crable wealth
chiefly in stock, but on account of the
remoteness of schools very few had
any education whatever and no knowl
edge of the English language. They
produced about enough rice for home
consumption by planting the rice in
the i' 'v places on the pr.irie and irri
by catching rain water.
This r.,, wa.: )J. ,est'd with a sickle,
thr2shed by str king hands full over
the edge cf a board or on a block or
stump and cleaned with a mortar and
pe:;tle. The raotnr was generally
made by sett;h! a sec'on of a log
on end and burning out . cavity in it.
This was sometimes facilitated by
chopping or boring ho'e:. Rice thus
cleaned and behf either fresh or drid
constituted almo4l exc!usively the
food of the people. While thousands
of cows roamed the prairie milk was
seldom used an! buttc: practically
unknown.
There was not a pulubic road in the
entire territory and very few bridg
es and those were of the crudest type.
About the only means of transporta
tion was a two-wheeled cart drawn by
cattle and the means of travel a cre
ole pony. The only fence known at
this time was the pew fence made
by split cypress boards about ten
feet long with each end hewn down
to fit into morticed holes in the posts
which were of the same material only
a little heavier. Then hauses were
generally built by erecting a frame of
hewn timber morticd and pinned to
gether and filled with clay and mud,
the roof of split shingles and the floor
often of split boards. A glass window
was practically unknown and screens
unheard of.
This in brief was the condition of
the country when the railroad was
opened in 1881. In 1882 Mr. J. B.
Watkins of Lawrence, Kansas, after
looking over this country organized
a syndicate and bought about 1,250,
000 acres in Vermillion, Cameron and
Calcasieu parishes, for this land he
paid from twelve and one-half cents
to one dollar and twenty-five cents
per acre. A large part of what is
now Jefferson Davis parish was in
cluded in the purchase and many of
our native people who might have had
all the land they wanted almost for
the asking suddenly found out there
was no more land to be bought except
from Watkins. This acquisition of
what we now recognize as some of
the most valuable lands at such a ri
diculously low price was justly char
acterized as a Pteal and subjected the
legislature of 1b82 to some severe
criticisms, it also took away. from the
native people the lands of which they
had been in undisputed possession
without a werning. And still we
now know that it was the beginning
of an era of development that has
rarely been equalled in a strictly ag
:'cultural country and instead
ing a curse to the native people it
has proven a blessing for it has given
them opportunities for development
they could n,:cr have enjoyed under
the old reg*r c and has converted a
vast area of pasture lands roamed
by the longhorned cattle and Creole
ponies into one of the finest agri
cultural countries in the world.
The assessors figures for 1883 show
that there were in cultivation in Cal- I
casieu parish, which embraced the 1
present Calcasieu, Beauregard, Allen t
and Jefferson Davis parishes, 12,575
acres all told, of this total 2,934 acres
were in rice and 6,336 acres in corn.
The report of the assessor of Jef-I
ferson Davis parish, for 1915 showsIE
190,376 acres classed as rice land at -
least 125,000 of which is in actual
cultivation. We have in Jefferson
Davis parish ,6;87 acres c!assed corn
land at least 5,500 of which is in ac
tual cultivation. Thus we see that
notwithstanding Jefferson Davis par- I
ish has had less than one-fifth of
the are of Calcasieu had in 1883 she h
has in gultivation about as much corne
and more than forty times as much t
rice as the whole territory. To some of
us who have been here through prac
tical!y all this growth it seems incred
ible that we have reached such pro
po'tions. Land values have steadily
adva.nced but not out of proportion
to th, other developments. In a le-t
tor written from Jennings by the late'
S. L. Cary in 1885 he st'ates "That
pecp!e from the north pricipally froml
Iowa hal acquired a block of land 6
x 21 miles in the vicinity of Jennings
by ho-reteadl or nerolly and that there 1
!wa yet much land about here sub
ject to entry besides a large amount
of S;:anigh Giant that could be bought
fo,r 1.25 to $7 per acre." At thist
t:w., I think a few good farms could
le !:ught as low as $15 per acre and
the -rice 'anges from that to about
I, if depending on location and im
orovements.
So far as I am able to learn the i
first public roa-d ever laid out in this
,arislah as in 1,;87 and passed through
the 'e::n of Welsh from north to
south. S;,ce then the question of
roads ha- hoen one that has interest
ed us continually. We now have as
near as can be calculated about 600
miles of laid out roads in the parish
upon which we have expended with
the la-' year the sum of $31,739.71
aL!d ' this time there is a proposi
tion before our people to authorize
the issuance of $500,000 in bonds to
further improve our roads. With the
improvement of roads has also come
the adoption of modern methods of
transnortation and travel instead of
the two wheeled ox cart of 35 years
ago we now have four-wheeled wa
gons drawn by good horses and mules
and some of our farmers are already
using motor trucks and many others
will as soon as we shall have surfac- 1
ed our roads. Instead of the Creole I
pony being the principle method of
travel a very large per cent of our
farmers as well as town people now
travel in automobiles.
At the time of which we write there
was in the territory now Jefferson
Davis Parish probably not to ex
ceed 160 children in the schools all
of which were poorly organized. The
public school property consisted of a
few rude shacks with cheapest make
shift for equipment. In this parish
we now have five high schools, a di
ploma from which entitles its holder
to entrance into any institution of
learning in the state and practically
all of the rural schools of the parish
1,360 pupils and the total value of
school property is $124,822.35. A
school census of the parish shows
that we now have a population of
18,000. These people have come
from almost every state in the union
and some foreign zoar,t:'ie.
The time was and not many years
since when a man here was neither a
IKajan or a Yankee depend!nr as to
whether he spoke French or English.
When the people from other ,ttes,
principally from the north began set
tling this country about the only thing
the average native could see in it was
that they were being deprived of
their lands and that their stock rang
es were being encroached upon and
they naturally resented the intrusion..i

DEATH OF LEE E, ROBINSON,
The sudden, though not unexpected,
passing away of another of our time
honored citizens marks an event of
mote than passing interest to the lit
tle city of Welsh, and to the Parish of
Jefferson Davis as well as to the
old "Imperial Calcasieu." Few men
have been more intimately and vitally
connected with the development and
progress of this sction of our beloved
state than was Mr. Robinson during
the twenty-eight years of his resi
dence here. He was born near Plain
City, Union County, Ohio, Feb. 10,
1862; the second son of Mr. W. H. and
Elizabeth McCampbell Robinson, and
spent the early part of his life on the
farm.
lie received his early education: in
the public schools of this state to
which he gave two years of service
as teacher.
In 1885 he graduated from Natio
Nal No:;mal University of Ohio, and the .
following session studied law in Ma
rysville, Ohio.
In 1886 he went to Nebraska. anr.,
engaged with his brother in the real
estate business for a year; and went
from there to Hope, Kansas in 18S7.
where he was employed in a bank and
I edited a newspaper.
In May, 888 he came to We!-h. I.a..
to engage in the real estate buint
and farming operations, opeiini:g -p
what is known as the Woods farm in
i1890. About this time he received
the appointment of Notary Public,
which position he filled up to about
two years ago.
About this time he also received ti:e
appointment of postmaster at Wel-h.,
t and held this office until 18',. 0:;
1 May 24, 1892 he was elected secre
tary of the Town of Welsh, and S!.rv
ed until June 30, 1894.
I In 1898 he purchased the cana: ani
- pumping plant south of Welb:. ,
gether with a large tract of !and,. :a':
began large farming operations there
1 the following year.
f In 1900 he formed a ptrenershi,
Swith Mr. Chas. Martin in the t, e:ti.
of the Calcasieu Rice Mill, which wa
operated one season under thi. n-::
1,agement, when he sold out hi- i:p :
test.
This same year (1900) he was erlct
ed to the office of mayor of Welsh foi
a one year term, and was re-electe I
s for two additional two year tei n:,
e concluding his term of office : in175
- In 1902, in the reorganization of
the local bank, he was chosen Ia esi
Stdent of the new organization !:nown
I as the First National Bank of Wclbh.
I to which position he was re-elected
in 1905 when a reorganization was
effected in connection with the coal
ition of the two banks that existel
s:at that time. And later, when the
b:ank was consolidated with the Ca!
casieu Trust and Savings Bank. ;e
- was elected vice-president of the new
s organization. In June 1904 he was
Selected Grand Worthy Patron of the
'Easte.'n Star, and served for orne year
in this high office.
SWhen Jefferson Davis became a
e parish, and at the organization of
She police jury, he was eelcted clerk
a of this body, which he served for
, nearly three and a half years.
f In 1902 he united with the Congre
s gational church, and when the Pres
Sbyterian church was organized he be
came one of the charter members. At
s the organization of the Sunday school
She was elected superintendent, and
I served in that capacity until 1909.
He was then chosen as the first tea
cher of the Baraca Class in the Sun
day school, and filled with credit
e this place until failng in health forc
R ed him to give up his work. In the
SChristian Endeavor Society he was
e always actively interested, and a most
a helpful and instructive leader.
- A Loving Cup given by the Sunday
school bearing the date of 1908 be
s peaks the esteem in which he was
f held, and the appreciation of his ser
y vices by that organization.
h The high esteem in which he was
Sheld by the members of the Baraca
· Class and the annual gifts presented
f by them, reveal the charactr of his
c work as a teacher of the Word of
n God.
S In fact the claims of the church
a were always recognized by him, and
o the church ~as given her rightful
1. place in the distribution of his ener
' gies. In everything pertaining to the
welfare of the community, and in ev
s ery enterprise that marked her prog
fress he was found among the fore
most leaders, contributirn liberally
of his energies, time and means to
the desired end. About thr'e years
ago dclini.g heal:h forced him to re
tire i±radually from the st'enuous act
ivities of life, and one by one these
duties passed to others who sought
.till the help of his counsel.
Among the latter activities of his
life was his connection with the Welsh
Warehouse and Supply Company, and t
the recent purchase of stock in the or
iginal canal known latcr a.; the "Clark
Plant."
While he had been in declining
health for so long still great surprise I
was evident when it became known
last Sunday morning that he would
probably not last through the day.
Telegrams were immediately sent
summoning the different members of
his family.
Th end came about 4 p. m., Sunday,
April 30, 1916.
HIe is survived by two brothers, J.I
C. and F. O. Robi, son of Hartington,
Nebraska; and three sisters: Mrs. R. I
Robinson, Columbus, Ohio; Mrs. Mary
McDowell, Los Angt'es, Ca!.; and
Mrs. J. D. Gilleylon, Jackson, Miss.; t
ar:d five children: Miss lone II., Miss I
Irma E., Mr. Stewart Irons, Miss
Marjorie Anne, and little Miss Eliz
abeth Mary.
Though he is gone yet he will live I
in the many activities Which mark t
the development and progress of the '
community.
Funeral services were held Thurs.
day afternoon at 4 o'clock from the t
Presbyterian church, conducted by r
Rev. E. M. Stewart. pastor. Relatives
and friends of the family, members of
the Police Jury, officials of Jefferson i
Davis parish and prominent men: of I
all walks in life from all over this sec.
tion of the state were present.
The last sad rites were performed
at Oaklawn Cemetery, where all that I
was mortal of our late friend L. E.
Robinson was laid to rest beside that
of his loving wife, who preceded him
about eighteen months.
ItlCE GROWERS ASSOCIATION
IN FLOURISHING (OND)ITION
The local office of the Southern
Rice Growers association has just
i een overhauled and arranged in a
most convenient manner to handle the
i:creased patronage of the coming
s-:eaon. Fresh paint has added to its
attractivenes', while the addition of
a private reception loom and tele
pW)ne booth are among the appreci
alIe conveniences.
`'. R. I. Abbott, the local manager
is using his every effort for the sue- I
c o._; f th farmr.:.; organization
;wch has accomplshed so much for
the rice industry. Mr. Abbott came
he:e in the midst of the season last
-ear, a stranger, but notwithstanding
that little handicap he handled the af
fairs of the association in a remark- I
ably satisfactory manner, and he
starts in the season with added con
i:dence, an established reput-tion and
a wide acquaintance with the farm- i
e rs.
In speaking of the affairs of the
association in this district early this
e.'ek Mr. Abbott said: "The associa
tion in this district will be stronger
this season than at any time in the
past, as the farmers are awakening
to the necessity of organization, for
it is an established fact that the as.
sociation had carried their point and
maintained valuations over all oppo
sition." He is looking forward to a
very active season, having booked so
far in this district something over
13.000 acres.
The association is in a very flcur
ishing condition at this time, due to
its having proven, beyond a doubt,
its ability to control the rice situa
tion against odds, as it did during the
past season, when adverse interests
exerted a concerted effort to break
the market and reduce the strong
hold of the farmers.
The successful handling of the sit
uation at that time has created a spir
it of confidence among the farmers
which will never again be shaken.
Throughout the rice district of the
three states, Texas, Louisiana and
Arkansas, the association is stronger
thnn ever befor1 has a larger mem
bership, and a financial stability
which bespeaks permanency.
WELSH STREETS
BEING GRAVELED
A large gang of men and teams
are busy this week preparing the
principal streets of Welsh and plac
ing gravel. The gravel being used
in this work is fuarnished by the dif
ferent companies supplying gravel,
the property owners here paying the
cost of transportation and laying.
These practical demor.ntrations are I
proving an eer!lasting benefit to

POLICE JURY A UE "D":
BY JENNIiGS BUSNIESS MEN
One of the best banquets, if not
the best that has ever satisfied and
entertained in Jefferson Davis parish,
was the bountiful feed sprcad by the
business men of Jennings Wednesday
after,oon in honor of the members
of th', Police Jury of Jefferson Davis
Parish.
The banquet was given to the legis
lative body of the parish in appreci
ation of the faithful services which
each and every member has given the
people of the parish since they as
sumed the duties of office on Janl
ary 1, 1913.
Jefferson Davis parish has made
magnificent and healthy strides dur
ing the first ye'ars of it. existence,
and the city officials and lusiness
and professional men of .Je nnings
thought it fitting, that the menmters of
the first police jury he shown in un
doubted terms the hearty approval
of the people of Jennings in the work
that has been accomplished by that
body.
It was thought that one of the best
means of demonstrating the esteem in
which the police jurors are held by the
citizens of Jennings and of the par
i.sh as a whole would be through ten
dering them a dinner where the ban
queters and the hanqueted could ga
ther, discuss the history of the par
ish, talk of the present prosperity
and besneak good things for the fu.
ture. The Jenningsites, therefore,
prepared one of the most bountiful
meals to which any person has ever
been invited, and there the Jennings
men tendering the banquet to mem
bers of Police Jury and others of the
perish and the Grand Lodge officers
of tue Masonic order spent more than
two hours in feasting and toasting.
Mr. John McHugh did himself proud
on this occasion. The banquet was
held at the Madeline hotel. Every one
who partook of the good things said
that it was the best dinner that he
had ever eaten. There was plenty of
everything, and each and every course
was prepared in the best style of th
cuisine art. Many were the congrat
ulations received by Mr. Mchlugh fol
lowing the banquet.
The menu follows:
Chicken gumbo, celery, olives, pick
les, jellied tongue, stuffed eggs, raisin
bread, chicken and mushrooms, mash
ed potatoes, green peas, new potatoes,
tomato salad, chicken pate, asparagus
Roquefoi t cheese, peach jelly, crack
ers, ice cream, cake, black coffee, ci
The banquet hall had been most
beautifully decorated for the occas
ion. Streamers of red, white and
blue hunting ran from corner to cor
ner of the dining room. Old Glory
colors were much in evidence in all
portions of the room. The two ta
bles were especially beautiful. On
these had been placed numreous clus
ters of pretty sweet peas and poppis,
products of the flower gardens of
lenaings.
Mayor John Gamble, of Jennings,
acted as toastmaster of the occasion.
When the black coffee and cigars had
been brought on, Mayo: Gamble
arose, and, calling for attention, re
quested toasts from a number pres
ernt, these including Grand Lodge of
ficers of the Masonic order; George
Hiathaway and A. T. Jones, members
of the police jury; Mayor Wm. B.
Gabbert, of Welsh; H. H. Hoag, J.
o. Modistte, Chas. S. Miller and
Thee. Kahn.
The talks dwelt mainly on the prog
ress made by Jefferso9 Davis parish;
the spirit of good feeling now exist
ing among the people of all portions
of the parish; the magnificent temple
of justcie now in course of construc
tion, and the corner stone laying;
and other matters attracting the at
tention of the people of the parish at
this time.
