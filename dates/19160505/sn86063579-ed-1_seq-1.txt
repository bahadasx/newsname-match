On thing' in sure. Deming liken
hitch olM chautauqua. And aii
, other thing in equally sure. High
class chautauqua like Deming.
Then facte have been proven by the
events of the past week.
When the Ellison-White Chautau
qua System earn here to look over
things, they found a divided senti
ment. Now that they have demon
strated beyond any doubt that they
are a sure-enough worth-while sys
tem, we are all "fer 'em." The good
things the many artists are going to
say about the town and its progres
sive people, are going to more than
pay the price in publicity.
Another thing: If we are going to
be an up-to-date modern city, we
have got to have up-to-date methods
and modern ways, and its a fact that
no modern, wide-awake city of our
population and superior intelligence
is today without its chautauqua week.
A well-conducted chautauqua, like
the Ellison-White, ought to be con
sidered a permanent asset to any
American community, and it is when
the people understand it. It is worth
twenty times as much as a circus.
Barnnm or Ringling come here for
seven hours and take away Ave to
six thousand dollars if they do ony
business at all. They leave perhaps,
2 per cent of their receipts, a saw
dust ring and a few peanut hulls,
while the chautauqua costs fifteen
hundred, advertises the town to the
full amount, leaves 21 - per cent of
receipts here with ns, stays seven
days, gives the cleanest entertain
ments obtainable nt a few cents, gets
the people to touch elbows and es-
tnjhlishe a community spirit thnt
spells success.
The program, which will conclude
Monday night, has thus fnr included
such national celebrities at the Om
its players, International Opera Co.,
Or. Thomas E. Green, one of the
greatest lecturers of the American
platform : the Skibinsky-Welsh Co.,
Charles Zueblin, who is doing more
for community betterment than any
other single man (or married man,
either, for that matter), in our (Trent
and glorious country; Lou Beau-
champ, one of the most noted author
lecturers, and travelers on two conti
nents, and we hav yet to enjoy the
world famnns New York Marine
Band, Kaffir Roy Choir and others
of national fame.
Local manager Hendrix, who has
n message every day that makes the
city better, says things are operating
to a "queen's taste" and that Dem
ing has been placed on his list of
permanent friends.
Pome again chautauqua, yonrV a
prnfltolile investment.
El Pnsn will have the same chau
tauqua next year. So will Deming.

Wonderful Record of Business Effi
ciency and the Reward That Comes
From "Sticking to It;" Will Hold a
tig Anniversary Sale Next West
Friday, May 7, 1885, a little groc
ery store was started where now
stands the finest store building in
New Mexico.
The interesting part of the story
is that the same man is doing busi
ness in the big handsome block who
stiirti-d the little store almost a third
of a century ago.
It was in May, 1882, that J. A.
Muboney, ayoung man with an ideal
and a determination to win, struck
Dewing. Three years later he start
ed the little grocery store above
mentioned, four years later he pot in
additional stocks of hardware and
house-furnishings, followed by a tin
shop and metal working establish
ments, all of which have now become
important industries for the south
west region.
As compared with the little 18x30
shack, the great store is 60x142 with
fine suites of offices on the second
floor that would compare favorably
with the Railway Exchange in Chi
cago, and a basement 8x10 feet larg
er than the first floor. Aside from
this modern building are the big ttu
and metal working shops, undertak
ing establishment, and warehouses,
covering nearly half a block.
The solidity . of the business house
that developed front almost noth
ing to a commanding place in the
commercial world, is shown by the
fact that some of the Mahoney em
ployes have been working contin
uously for a quarter of a century.
Mr. C. J. Kelley, who is now a mem
ber of the corporation, has been on
the job for 22 years; John Winfleld,
foreman of the tin shop, 25 years:
M. L. Weber, 22 years and Santa
Rosa Mamffo, 27 years.
This story is written to refresh the
public mind on a meritorious insti
tution that has been built up in our
midst as the result of well directed
energy and sound business princi
ples, and to let the outside world
be thoroughly advised that Deminc
a town worth while.

man and the Position of Plumb
ing Inspector Is Abolished.
The first meeting of the new board
of trustees of Deming was held in
the city hall, Tuesduy evening. M.
A. Norillmus was elected chairman
of the board, a position thut corns-
ponds to that of mayor. Emxy Tabor
HHinted night watchman in place of
John Warren. The position of in
sMctor of plumbing was abolished.
The board received the petition
signed bv 110 voters asking for a
local option election under the liquor
law recently enacted. The election
was set for June 24. Roth "wets"
and "ilrys" are working hard and it
is exeetcd that a close election wilt
result. S fnr there has been a not
ieeullile Inek of bitterness that usual
ly accompanies such elections. The
"drys" are determined however, and
the liquor men, while accepting the
challenge in a sportsmanlike manner
are leaving nothing undone to secure
their interests.
TWO STICKS OF DYNAMITE
FOUND IN DEMING ARMORY
Two sticks of giant powder and a
tenet h of fuse were found in the drill
hull of the partly completed Deming
armory Inst Friday morning by the
watchman. The explosive was found
wrapped in pner behind the unhung
iron doors. The doors were leaning
ngninst the wall. There was no cap
for setting ng the charge and no tim-
uir mechnnjsm found in the package.
W. W. Barracks, the contractor,
is uncertain whether the person thnt
deMsiled the dynnmite in the build
ing intended the cctioii to be con
strued as a threat, or whether an at
tempt to blow up the building was to
Ih nuule. Several Mexicans are cm
ployed by Mr. Hurra ks on the work,
hut nil of them denied any knowledge
of how the explosive got into the
'building. The National fluiird offic
ers were notified hut so far no clue
ha'-' been found.
There is only one firm in Deming
handling dynamite, hut quantities of
it are shipied in by mine owners.
As the mines are particularly active
at this time the explosive could he
readily obtained and without making
a purchase at the local store where
orders for le than ten pounds of
dynamite are not filled. Fifty pounds
were recently stolen from a mine ar
Cook's Peii.
The hnihiili',' wns thoroughly
searched for possible, "plants" that
might be exploded Inter on, but none
were found.
The armory will pot In- completed
for another month. It is a twn-story
brick structure 175 bv "ift feet. The
fact thnt the explosive was found in
a building detuned for military ne
has, of course caused the incident to
assume more interest than it would
otherwise. There has been no troub
le with the Mxienn population eith
er n or near Deming and none is an
ticipated. Wnshinirton, May 4 Germany'
reply to the demand of the United
States for immediate abandonment of
the present methods of the present
submarine warfare, delivered to Am
bassador Oerard today, was awaited
by officials of the Washington gov
emment tonight with expectant ten
sion. They were without any defi
nite idea of what the communication
contained. A hrief meatre from Am
bassador Oernrd, as well ns press re
liort. however, created the impres
sion thnt the imterial government
would impose conditions which the
United States government could not
accept.
ft was reiterated thnt President
Wilson stood unalterably by the po
sition declared in the note to Ger
many thnt the abandonment of the
nresent submarine method mnst be
declared in effect immediately or the
TVted State mnst sever diplomatic
relations. The demand was design-
Daxtarpa Cta

Miss Perkins should hav a

Dr. Green told the T truth, the whole
truth, and nothing bnt the truth
about the Army and Navy League.
If Secretary Lane aver told the
truth in his life it was when ba told
Zueblin that when the plans of the
chamber of commerce are fully de
veloped and carried ont according to
schedule, Luna county will ba on of
the most prosperous spots on the
globe.
Beauchamp hewed off a few chips
thut cut close to the line, bnt he has
a way of making everbody like it
tie ought to lecture here every
month.
Pollard told Zueblin about that
station park be liked so well and it
made the big community builder feet
good.
Secretary Lane and a Graphic rep
resentative showed Zueblin what two
men are doing in Luna county John
Ingram and L. L. Oaskell. The big
lecturer was curious enough to ask
the question ; "Why don't other per
sons follow their example and make
this one of the greatest valleys in
Hie world!"
El Paso and Doming are both
crazy about high class chautauqua.
Roth realize the great benefits to be
gotten from the assemblies.

Thirty-Five More Pupils May I Than
There Were April 1-430 Boys
and 52) Skis; Twenty-Six High
School Graduates This Summer.
Deming school are right up in the
front seat close to the orchestra. In
fact,, we put one over over on El
Paso schools this year. The Pass
City has only fifty graduates this
year, while Deming, with a popula
tion of about one-tenth, hus twenty
six thirteen boys and thirteen girls,
It is to be doubted if this happy
combination can be duplicated in any
other city in the country.
The Eighth grade comes through
this year with twenty-three boys and
eighteen girls, which is anotehr cause
for congratulation.
Taking New Mexico as a compar
ison and Deming as a basis, this
would give us a school census of
1721.
Does it look as though folks, were
frightened very much around these
parts t
They don't show it much if they
are.
Get these figures: 530 boys and
120 girls. This ought to be shown to

REV. E. C. CSRSAN KZ TO
CAnFA, TEXAS, FRCS KZ.'Z
The Methodist organisation ia al
tost military in its methods of hand
ling pastors. That is why th Dem
ing popular Methodist preacher, Itev.
E. C. Morgan, will leave this week for
Marfa, Texas.
The reason for this bangs is that
Albuquerque had a vacant pulpit to
be filled. Marfa's pastor waa first
in length of service, so th Marfa pas
tor was sent to Albuquerque. Dem
ing pastor was second in length of
service and so he was sent to Marfa.
Marfa is a fine town, has a 017,000
church.
While we exceedingly regret th
rmo al of Rev. Morgan and hi most
estimable family, we congratulate him
on going to th larger field of labor.
He has taken into his church 105 new
members and leaves tbe church in the
best of condition.
Sunday evening, his brother past
ors, Rev. Mitchelmore of tbe Presby
terian church, Rev. Piatt of the Bap
tist, and Rev. McClure of the Christ
ian, with congregations of all church
joined in a farewell service to Rev.
Morgan.
The future appointments here will
lie as follows: May 7, Rev. C. M.
Moore, (also Capitol Dome); May
14, Mr. G. Jones, morning, and I. J.
Ayers, evening; Rev. Lawrence Pat-
terson of Lydia Peterson Institute,
M Paso, will fill the time until June
10, when Rev. Frank Collin of tho
Texas conference will move here with
bis family to take up the rgular
work.
Mrs. Morgan will remain here with
the children until the close of tbe
M-hool year.

Popular Deming Woman, Wife of a
Former Deming Business Man and
Sister of Arthur C, Chris, and
Henry Raithet; Is .Mourned Hero
It is with unfeigned grief that we
are compiled today to chronicle the
death of Mrs. James E. Irvine, one
of Deming' best loved women. Al-
hongh she has lived in California
for the past ix veurs, Deming, her
old home, still claimed her as its
own.
As s girl and young woman, Agiist.t
Knithel waa very popular in Deming.
She was born February 2, 1874, and
she passed to the higher life at Long
Beach, May 1, 1916. She was mar
ried to James E. Irvine November 18,
18fl5, one daughter, Margaret, bles
sing the union. Margaret is just
blooming into womanhood, and was
higly honored in her school work this
year by being made class historian.
She is a second honor student of the
class of Id, Polytechnic High School,
Loiur Beach.
The deceased leaves her bereaved
husband and daughter; her mother,
Mrs. Margaret Raithel, ; three broth
ers. Chris Raithel: one sister, Mrs.
and Henry Raithel: one sister, Mrs.
1L C. Brown, and a world of loving
friends to mourn her untimely de
parture. The mother was with her some time
before the end came, and her broth
ers, Arthur and Henry arrived a half
hour before she passed away.
The funeral wa at Long Reach,
where the burial took place.
Mrs. Jennie Martin, who has just
returned from the Pacific coast, says
-be ha traveled in all parts of the
country, but that Deming is the only
town she is really satisfied to cail
her home.
One of Demimt'a very iopuIar
yonng men. Zene U. Mason, was rais
ed to the sublime dtvree of a Master
Mason, last evening, although Zene
ft.nre that he has been a masu-r
Mason all the time.

have been killed, four probably fat
ally injured, and a score of other
seriously hurt Tuesday afternoon,
when a mob, said by the authorities
to have been composed principally
of foreigners, attacked the Edgar
