DON'T SI0P WCFN YOU
HAVE ONE CLUB MAD UP
Any of the Prizes Are Worth
Every Effrot Put Forth
Don't Stop to Rest Until
You Have Won Your Prize
Time Enuf Then.
The campaign for one of the
golden awards offered by The
Mountain Advocate may be won
by the effort put forth in the
remaining hours of the 100,000
extra vote offer, for every club
of $25.00 of subscriptions.
Think of what it would mean,
if, by a little extra effort, you
secured one or two clubs of $25
each. It would mean 100,000
votes for each club, in addition
to the regular number of votes
allowed for each subscription.
Any contestant taking advantage
of this offer can readily see that
a few clubs will give a total
sufficient to give any contestant
a very hopeful outlook at the
close of the campaign. These
days may be the pivotal time for
you and if every hour is utilized
to the utmost, the result in votes
gained may make you one of the
winners.
THE SUBSCRIPTIONS COUNT.
It will be to the candidates
who are putting in their time on
the days when subscriptions
count for the most votes that the
prizes will go. Your time may
be valuable, but taking into con
sideration the value of the prizes
to be fought for and the length
of time the campaign will run,
no contestant can afford to re
main idle when there is a chance
of winning $725.00. These days
may be the deciding days of the
fight.
KEEP WORKING ALL THE TIME.
Do not stop when you have
called on all your friends. When
your list of acquaintances has
been exhausted, begin on the
people you do not krow. Tell

WELL WORTH THE EFFORT.
No candidate can hope to win
anything worth while .vi'hout

for them to come in with their
subscriptions without personal
solicitation either over the tele
phone, by circular letter, or per
sonal interview.
A MATTER OF AMIiniOV.
If you have an ambition to win,
and the energy to accomplish
your ambition, you will win the
respect of everyone, whether or
not they are your friends or
merely residents with you in the
same city and town. Everyone
likes to see someone with ambi

energy to make their ambition a
realization. Everyone is ready
to help the ambitious when they
are really enthusiastic and in
dead earnest.
Get busy! You have eight
more days which may spell
$725.00 for you. Go out to win
and you will!

Sad Death In Atlanta, Ga.
On last Saturday afternoon a
message was received by Mr.
E. T. English, of our city, an
nouncing the death of his grand
daughter, Mrs. Clay Driskel, of
Atlanta, Ga. Mrs. Driskel was
formerly Miss Nellie England,
daughter of Edward T. England,

Nellie England was a sweet
and beautiful child and was the
idol of her parents. As she grew
into young womnnhr"'1 -'
veloped a s " , .
tion and a charm of manner that
endeared her to many hearts.
While she lived hevc she was a
student of Union College. After
moving to Atlanta she graduated
in the High School, and soon
afterwards she won a scholar
ship in Brenan College, in a
literary contest over many con
testants. She was always popu
lar in school, and after leaving
school, she was a great favorite
in society. She was also active
in church work, and we believe
she is now happy in a world
where the glories of this world
are so far excelled by the glories
of that that they are not to be
named in comparison.
Death loves a shining mark it
has been truly said; this has been
exemplified in the death of our
"Little Nell."
Oh! how our hearts bleed for
the family, for the relatives, and
for the grief stricken husband,
who one short year ago united
his destiny with that of this dear
girl's. The young couple started
out on life's journey with as
bright prospects as ever dawned
on two loving hearts.
Only those who have been
similarly bereft have any con
ception of the anguish that
wrings the hearts of parents and
husband.
"Sharp the pain, and keen the
anguish,
None, but stricken hearts can
know;
But tis our Father holds the
chisel
From His hand descends the
blow.
In His boundless love and wis
dom He would shape our lives
aright,
Though our hearts choicest Jew
els Oft are taken from our sight"

The past eighteen months have taught us here in
America what lack of industrial preparedness has meant
to seme of the countries now at war. These nations
had the ships and they had the men: but when the hour
struck, their factories were not able to furnish the colors
with arms and shells and powder. Their factories were
not prepared. And our factories are not prepared.
But it is not enough to draw a moral. In tht United Iwtts five

The Associated Advertising Clubs of the World, representing
all advertising interests have offered their free and hesmyMrvfce to the
President of the United States, in close cooperation with these fite
Fngintering Societies, to the end that the Country may know what the
Engineers arc doing. The President has accepted the offer. The
Engineers have w omed the co-operation.
This advertisement, published without cost to the United States, is
the first in a nation-wide series to call the country to the duty of co
operating promptly and fully with the Engineers.

. ..fe as a should, road improve
ment will receive, as a result of
disastrous waste and discourage
ment, a set-back which will be
felt for a half century.
Kentucky has many counties
which have for the better part
of a century been beneficiaries of
good roads, speaking compara
tively. It has many other coun
ties which possess great wealth,
part of it developed and much of
it undeveloped, but suffer from a
lack of neighborhood transporta
tion faculties. Those counties
can double the value of their real
esta. for agricultural purposes,
orhastcnthe development of their
timber and mineral resources
by "getting upon the road map."
But they canfto do so b. voting
for bonds and feeling that as
they have pushed the button they
do not have to do the rest.
The money which was raised
in Bell has not been thrown away
it appears, but its uisnursers
adopted a scale of expenditures
too great for the funds in hand
to accommodate. The lesson
that has been learned may be suf
ficiently salutary to result in the
amount raised by a new bond is
sue serving to save the day.
Where there is honesty there is
hope. And there seems to be no
question about the excellent in
tentions and the integrity of the
handlers of the road funds in the
county which is providing a con
spicuous example of first-dash
recklessness.
A county which has been bond
ed must be so improved that ev
ery taxpayer will be satisfied that
the bonding was wise, if the good
roads propaganda is to thrive in
the county. It has been demon
strated in England and France
and elsewhere that as long as
small governmental units have
been left to make their roads the
result has not been a system of
approximately uniform good
wads. And Kentucky may lind.

the short comings of President
Wilson's Administration that at

instantly seized upon by Repub

100,000 copies of Mr. Powers'
speech was sont out as campaign
literature in all the close states
of the Union where elections
were to be held last fall, notably

On Monday evening, from 8
to 11, the Seniors of Union Col

Juniors, at Speed Hall.
The suite of rooms were very
artistically decorated, the Senior
colors ol pink and green being
carried out in pink carnations
and ferns. A very original con
test, the point of which was to
guess from a verse of poetry
characteristic of each one, the
names of the Seniors. Mr. Joe

which was a boquet of pink car

Delightful refreshments, con

served. The colored orchestra

A ROLL OF HONOR BANK
Is one whose surplus is equal to its capital
stock. "The Financier", a paper published in New
York, gets from the Government the names of all
banks whose surplus is equal to its capital, and pub
lishes them as HONOR ROLL BANKS. Thus if a
bank has a capital of $15,000.00 and a surplus of
$15,000.00 it is an "Honor Roll Bank" just the same
as a bank with a MILLION DOLLARS of CAPITAL
and a MILLION DOLLARS of SURPLUS.

ONE COUNTY HOLDING
UP TRAVEL OVER EN
TIRE DIXIE HIGHWAY
Barely 290 Miles Kotiyh Road
Prevent Through Iravel in
All Weather Over Route
Baruij two hundrcl and nienty
miles of rough road prevent the
announcement at this time of a
through Dixie Highway, travel
able in all weather, from Michi
gan to Florida.
Approximately 170 miles of this
is between Chattanooga and
Nashville on the western division
of the highway in Tennessee; the
remaining 120 is on the eastern
division between Knoxville,
Tenn., and Cincinnati, Ohio,
through the Tennessee counties
of Union and Claiborne, and the
Kentucky counties of Knox, Lau
rel and Rockcastle. The three
last named have already voted
bond issues, Knox and Laurel for
$100,000 each and Rockcastle for
$200,000. This with the state
aid fund they will each receive
is ample to build their section of
the highway, and it is now only
a matter of a fe v months until
the road here is as perfect as is
the boulevard through Bell
county to the south.
The routing from Knoxville
north to the Bell county line has
not yet been definitely settled.
Campbell county, which is an
applicant for a link of the Dixie
Highway on this division, is
building a pike through the
mountains at a cost of $15,000
per mile. Two hundred convicts
are pushing this work through.
The road from Knoxville north
as tentatively fixed traverses the
counties of Union and Claiborne.
Union county has sold bonds to
defray the cost of construction.
Claiborne is now at work on its
section of the road leading to the
state line north.
