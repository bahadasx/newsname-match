THE FLY NUISANCE
Public sentiment has made excellent
progress in regard to the fly pest.
Many of us can remember from our
childhood how indifferent people were
to this plague. They accepted it as
one of the trifling annoyances of life,
to be ignored by all sensible people.
To fret because of the attacks of in
sects was regarded as a sign of child
ishness and lack of self control.
It was more customary in those days
to build stables quite near houses. In
many places the fashion prevailed of
attaching them directly to dwellings,
sometimes connected with a woodshed"
or carriage house,"" No good reason
appeared for this proximity, except
possibly that on a stormy day the
owner could go out to his beasts with
out getting wet, a very poor excuse
for a thoroughly undesirable arrange
ment. The result was that perfect swarms
of flies, attracted by animal refuse,
would swarm in such places and
plague a whole neighborhood. People
would stand the nuisance all day.
Perhaps at night to'get a little relief,
they would organize fly driving cam
paigns, and pursue the little vermin
with feather dusters, brooms, and
newspapers. After about an hour the
flies would be as thick as ever, having
crawled out from their places of re
fuge. . It would be a disgusting sight
today to see them feeding on our food
at table as they used to do so freely.
A well screened house is accepted
now as one of the essentials of com
fort. Summer hotels and boarding
houses that don't provide this essen
tial must not expect to see many
guests return for a second vacation.
As long as flies were regarded as a
mere annoyance, it was well enough
to maintain spartan indifference. Now
that everyone knows that they are a
principal carrier of disease, it is an
other matter. Property owners
should have a care how they build sta
bles near dwellings, and should reduce

the suit which had been pending in
court in Carrol county concerning the
establishment of the road.

which delayed the progress of the
work on this much needed highway.

road from Seligman to the state line,

WALL STREET HEARS OF PEACE
A British Statesman Quoted in Expec
tation of End of War Soon
New York, May 3. Financial cir
cles here today received word from
reliable sources that a member of the
British government had stated in pri
vate conversations that he expects
peace within a few months. There
was some uncertainty as to whether
this remark was based on the knowl
edge that negotiations are actually
pending and consequently the stock
market was not much affected.
1916 IS PREDICTED
There's going to be a shortage in
the 1916 wheat crop of 160,000,000
bushels under the, 1915 crop, according
to the report made by the government
experts April 1. Unfavorable weath
er conditions and late planting last
fall are two of the reasons why pres
ent indications point to a short crop
in 1916.
Every indication points tc higher
prices of food stuffs, ercri with larger
yields than last year, as long as the
present war conditions last. A wheat
crop that is one-third short will make
high prices even higher. Farmers
who get the large yields per acre are
the farmers who will have the largest
profits from their season's work. It
is too late to increase the number of
acres in wheat, but it is not too late
to increase the production per acre
through feeding the crop by top
dressing. WILL VISIT OLD HOME
Eugene H. Cuendet, of St. Louis,
brother of Mrs. Clara R. Margot, of
West Dun street, is expecting to come
