"God Forbid That We Should
He Drawn Into The War,"
President Tells Womens
Encampment.
Washington, May 1.?America ro
awukened in national spirit through
lessons of the war in Europe was tile
theme of an address by President
Wilson today at the opening of the
National Service School Military En
compmeut lor Young Women.
In concluding, the President voiced
a warning that the honor and integrity
of the United States canot be uini
pered with. He prayed that the coun?
try should not be drawn in to war,
but declared that if it should be "in
the great voice of national enthusiasm
which would be raised, all the world
would stand once more thrilled to
hear the voice of the New World
asserting the standards of justice and
liberty."
The President's address, in part, is
as follows:
"It is with unaffected pleasure that
I como to greet you as you have as?
sembled for the interesting things you
are going to do. 1 have always felt
that there was very much more in?
spiration in things that were volun?
tarily done than in things that were
done under official direction and by
ollicial summons. You have volun?
teered to come together without of?
ficial suggestion, in order to study
some things which, while theyo are
characteristic of the sort of comfort
and assistance which women have
been accustomed to offer, are, never?
theless in this instance associated with
a very great national conception and
duty.
"We, of course, are living in the
presence of conditions which wc can?
not yet assess, because they are un?
precedented. The world never wit?
nessed such a war as is now convuls?
ing almost every part of the world,
except this part which we particularly
love and would seek to safe-guard,
and the very foundations of tbe ordi?
nary life of nations have been dis?
turbed, so deeply disturbed that no
man can predict what the final set?
tlement will be. And if this war has
done nothing else, it has at least done
this: It has made America aware of
dangers which most of us had dream?
ed unreal, and has made us aware ,
that the danger of our own lime is
nothing less than the unsettlemcnt of
the foundations of civilization.
"Civilization does not rest upon
war. It rests upon peace, it rests
upon those things which men achieve
by co-operation and mutual interest
in one another. It does not llourisb
in the soil of hostility and antago?
nism, nnd a world war is a war in
the presence of which civilization
holds its breath and wonders if it wih
itself survive. As we see these great
issues joined, we on one side of the
water are done this great service: We
arc reminded of our spiritual relations
not only to this great struggle, but
particularly to this great nation of
which we constitute parts. Ami our
spiritual relation to the rest of the
world is determined by our spiritual
relation to America.
"You have come togeth r to be pre?
pared for any unusual duty which
American may call upon you to per?
form. But what has moved you to do
this? You duty to your country. But
what is the foundation of that duty?
What do you conceive America to be?
When you come to the last searching
analysis we do not owne any duty
except to things that wc believe",
and the glory of performing our duty
toward America is that we believe in
America, and we believe in America,
because?I venture to say it with en?
tire respect for tho other peoples and
other Governments?this Government
was establieshed with special purpose
such as no other Government ever
avowed. This Government was estab?
lished in order that justice and liberty
might belong to every man whom
our institutions could touch, and not
only that justice and libertv should
belong to America was concerned and
her influence involved they should be
extended to mankind everywhere. So
the inspiration of serving America is
a very profound inspiration.
"Have you not thought what might
be the outcome of this great strug?
gle, so far as the nations already en?
gaged are concerned ? an you not
imagine the great awakening that has
come to a country like France, for ex?
ample? How much more intensely
every Frenchman and every German
feels the national compulsion than he
ever felt it fobere? How much more
he feels himself not nn [dividual, but
a fraction of a gieat whole? How
much more his blood springs to the
challenge of patriotic suggestions?
IU- is not fighting for his own life. He
is sacrificing his own life, or willing
to sacrifice it, in order that a greater
life than his might persist?the life
of his nation.
"So in American wc are getting al?
ready the indirect beenfit of that sug?
gestion. We are beginning to realize
how a nation is a unit, and Hint any
individual of it who does not feel the
impulse of the whole docs not belong
to it and does not belong in it.
"We have heard a great deal about
divided allegiance in this country, but
before we discuss divided allegiance
in its political aspect wo ought to let
our thoughts run back to what were
perhaps our divided allegiances in
respect to our relations to each other.
"America has been brought to such
a point of diversification of interest,
of occupation, of objects sought that
she was in danger of losing the con?
sciousness of her singleness nnd soli?
darity. There were men pulling at
cross purposes in regard to their pri?
vate interests and their public en?
deavors in this country long before
the war came to remind us that we
were a single nation, wiht a single
duty and a single ideal, and the first
thing that has happened to us is that
we have all been pulled together by a
great tug at the heart in respect of
our individual interests.
"We have all been reminded with
nn emphasis for which I thank God.
that we arc first of all Americans,
and only after that at liberty to seek
our individual interest.
"And then those of our fellow cit
izens who may for a little while have
been tempted to think rather of the
lands of their origin than of the land
of their present allegiance have been
reminded thai there is, politically
speaking, only one allegiance conceiv?
able and possible."

L'AZEWKLL, VI
Town AIDictcd With Open Sa?
loons For Thirty Years. Now
Dry, and Hopes For Future
Bright.
The deluge feared here ns u result
of a surplus supply of liquor supposed
lo have boon bought on the closing
days of the saloons in Pocahontas, <li>l
not materialize. There has boon no
indication so far that a general "tank?
ing up" is to bo expected. The "old
soaks," who get drunk when they got
:i chance, have about concluded to cut
it out now, that, it cannot be had so
easily. Think of it! Pocahontas with?
out a saloon! Think of a court day or
horse day here without one or more
liquor drummers! And so, the world
moves!
For years this was her distinguished
honor. Tht fine banks, business
houses, splendid men and women, were
seldom mentioned. In fact, few peo?
ple outside ?strangers?knew that
there wore other industries in that
town, or other people in that town,
except what was in some way connect?
ed with the liquor business.
The dry goods anil other merchants
mlfcrcd because out of town buyers
Lvero actually afraid to go to Poca
liontas to buy goods. There were cer?
tain ilays when no woman of res-.
[ICClihility would care to walk the
streets of the town unless neeompnni
sd by her husband or some man friend,
razewcll county jail was never free of
>ne or more victins of PocnhonUtS
liquor, and not a cemetery in this
Xtunty that does not contain a grave
>f one victim. Put now a new era has
lawncd upon the little "smoky city."
md a new lease has been taken. The
trogrcssive, Christian citizens of that
own, will put their shoulders to the
?.heel, and make Pocahontas what is
10 well deserves to be. one of the best
owns in the slate. The abolition of
ho saloon will no longer bo a divid
ng line?"a bone of contention," hut
II logcathcr the citizens of the com
liunity will rehabilitate the town, ami
? new Pocahontas will spring up from
ho old. It will prove a good thing,
oo, for tin- liquor sellers, many of
'.'hom were men of strong minds and
nptlblo <>f belter thinjrs than dc
muching of hi s fcllowmcn.
The ties, heretofore restricted, bind
llg Tazowell and Pocahontas, will bo
ncroascil and strengthened, and the

A SERMON FOR TODAY.
New Paths to Newer Worlds.
"Ye luxve not passed this way hereto?
fore."?Joshua, iii.. 4.
Nothing is more impressive in the
story of Hie Exodus than tin- trouble
which the lenders of tho host encoun?
tered in persuading their followers to
imtiiiuc their march to the land which
had been promised them by God.
Whenever the journey became perilous
Moses was reminded of the security
of Egypt and besought to return
thereto. Whenever a chance encamp?
ment like that at MU Sinai proved at?
tractive Moses was urged to press on
no further, but lo accent this halting
place as the new abode. And even
when the promised land was in sight
across the Jordan there were those
who were afraid to advance, because
they had "not passed this way hero
loforc."
It is doubt fid if there is any more
serious obstacle to progress than the
innate reluctance to tread unfamiliar
paths which is here illustrated. Creat?
ures of habit by tbe very constitution
of our phvsical organism, we feel at
ease only when following a road which
we have "missed" over many times
before, or which has been beaten
smooth by the feet of the multitudes
that have preceded us. Adventurous
souls there are who welcome new
ideas and find that fact that, they
have not passed this way heretofore
the best, of reasons for passing tbi.
way now. Such men are the explor?
ers, discoverers, inventor.;, reformers,
of their time. But most of us cling to
tradition, worship dogma, and are eon
tent. 10 live in conformity to custom.
We regard age as sure evidence ol
sanctity, familiarity a sound criterion
of truth and precedent as identical
with righteousness. That our fathers
believed a certain doctrine is sufficient
reason for our believing il! That a
certain (hing has been done from time
immemorial is proof positive that it
must contiuc to be done! That a cer?
tain pnht has been tbe road for gen?
erations of hurrying feet is evidence
that, this path is "the path which we
must travel, too."
That the new is necessarily the
true by no means follows from this
sad experience of the race. But il does
follow therefrom that progress in
the nature of things must, be by ways
we have not passed heretofore. To
shun these ways is to stand stock still
or else to move in vicious circle
which leads nowhere. It is to nbide
on low levels and to keep within nar?
row borders. If we are to gel ahead
il. must be by breaking through the
wilderness of tbe unknown which is
i inging around us. And that we must
to get ahead if we are to escape de
cav and death is a law of life. Space
is endless, time eternal, God inlinitcl
'file universe knows no horizons, the
mind no bounds, tin- desires of man's
heart, no satisfactions! The very fact
that there is a wilderness of the un?
known proves thai, there are new lands
yet lo he discovered and explored and
new paths, therefore, to lie blazed.
All of which mo..ns that we must have
ears that, are open to new proclama?
tions of truth, eyes that rest gladly
(in new revelations of the spirit, feel
(hat seek swiftly new paths lo loftier
heights. Not age, nor weariness, nor
lung service, or great achievement can
absolve us from the task, imposed
anew each day, of leaving behind fa?
miliar spots and pressing on by ways
"not pressed heretofore" to the Prom?
ised land. The cry of Ulysses lo his
shipmates must bo ever ours:?
'"Tis not too late to seek a newer
world.
To Rlrivc, to seek, to find and not to
yield."
John Hayes Holmes.

.Old power plum, Iwo busy coal yards,
ami lull I' a dozen good stares, con?
tribute to this. The Norfolk it Wes?
tern road which here has one of its
most important distributing points,
for all Tazewell and a slice of West
s irginin, adds not a little to the vol?
ume of trade.
The great, good roads movement,
which has given us good roads, three
line bridges, leading to the county
and a boulevard sipiare near the sta
lioii, must also be mentioned.
The Mayor and Sergeant have be?
gan tilling in of the principal eyesorcrf
of the town. The space reserved for
sidewalks in front, of the liar mull and
fynos shacks on Main Street, and thin
it is hoped will suggest the lilling in
of that sipiare with a better class of
buildings.

ill at the home here. May be slightly
better as this is written ami is at?
