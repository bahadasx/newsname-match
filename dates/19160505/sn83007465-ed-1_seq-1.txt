Washington, May 4.?Germany's

of present methods of submarine a
warfare, delivered to Ambassador a
Gerard to-day. was awaited by of- '
^ j/ - Washington government
with expectant tension. They
were without any definite idea of v
, what the communication contained. c
A brief message from Ambassador
Gerard as well as press reports, how- 1
1 ? ..-ever, had created the Impression
^ ' that the Imperial government would
propose conditions which the United
States could not accept.
It was reiterated that President *
Wilson stood unalterably hv the po>WP
sition declared in the note to fjer- j
jm many?that the abandonment of f
mi- present submarine methods must bn
declared and effected immediately or *
the United States must sever dip (
^ lomatic relations. This demand was
designed to permit of no argument
and high officials repeatedly have as- f
r sorted that anything short of a literal ^
compliance would be followed by a
diplomatic rupture.
