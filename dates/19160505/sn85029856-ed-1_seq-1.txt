The Emporia Chamber of Com

.about its work and the work of other
clubs ever the state. In its issue of
.'April 29 it had the following to say
. ; about the Liberal meeting: "Last
Friday evening a Chamber of Com
'rmerce and Retailers' Association, was
-organized at Liberal with 45 mem
' T)ers to start with. They expect to
'"have 75 before the office Is opened.
Their dues will be from $1 to 84 per
.member and they will pay $l00 for a
man from the State office who will
be trained to make things move as
'they should. If you And a towp that
fie livelier than Liberal you will have
to go some. Only two days were
. spent there by the Secretary and with
the co-operation of some of their 'live
wires' the organization work move
t-along like clock work. Mr. H. W.
Magruder was elected president and
the way he took things in charge im
mediately after he was elected shows
he will make things 'hum' in that lit
tle city. They have had no Commer
cial organization of any kind at Lib
eral in the past and the fact that it
has made a Chamber of Commerce

much to that community."

THIS IS STYLEPLUS SEASON
When war prices are showing up on all sides more men
than ever are turning to the famous suit of one pi ice
"The same price the nation over."
Splendid all-wcjl fabrics, no finer style at any price. Big selections.
We looked the clothing market over carefully before selecting our two lines
of high grade clothing We positively could find no better. We can save
you from $3.00 to $8.00 on Styleplus.
MILLINERY DEPARTMENT
Mrs. Alma Atterberry says Liberal certainly appreciates stylish and
up-to-the-minute millinery. She is delivering these features at reasonable
prices. That's why our millinery sales have doubled any previous season's
sales. :
Of course you have heard much of our Dress Goods, Ready 'to Wear

Chas. Summers & Sons
gator ot the new Chamber of Com
merce thinks ot the way Liberal has
started out on the new project, and
should serve as an. encouragement to
the members. The secretary will be
"imported" In order to get a com
petent man who is not tied up in any
way with any particular business
house of the town, and will be put on
a straight salary to work for the en
tire town and every member of the
chamber. Instead of for one or two
particular ones. The new Chamber
of Commerce is now started and Is
in excellent shape to do something
for the town. The organization can
not be kept up, either financially or
spiritually, by a few members who
are willing to do more than their
share; it will take united, concerted,
harmonious effort' on the part ot ev
ery member to make It the instru
ment for good that It is Intended to
be.

THADI
FOR COUNTY ATTORNEY
The Democrat this week presents
to its readers the candidacy of George
LV Lighfr-for tha office of county at
torney. Mr. Light has been a citizen
of Seward county for nearly 10 years,
the last four 'of which he has served
in the capacity of clerk of the dis
trict court. He began studying law
as soon as he was elected clerk and
was admitted to the bar by the su
preme court last January, having dug
out the whys and wherefores of the
law by his own efforts and at the
expense of much midnight electricity.
His records as clerk of the court
have not suffered any by his work in
delving out the Intricate legal prob
lems at the same time, and we don't
believe there Is a set of court records
in the state that have been kept in
better shape. Not only is O. L. com
petent to fillthe office of county at
torney, but you will always find him
lined up with the side ot law, order
and decency, whether in or out of
office, which goes a long way when
selecting material for that office. He
Is one of the few who have gone up
against the board of legal examiners
that passed the same at the first ex
amination, but he came through with
a high average. It looks at this time
like there will be no, candidate
against him in either the primary or
general election, as there ' is not a
Democratic attorney in the county
and we have heard of none of the
others who wants to get in. In that
case he will Just about have the Job
cinched beforehand.' However, he
will make good if elected, and it
would be a pleasure to say something
nice about him if he were only run
ning on the Democratic ticket.
FOB COUNTY COMMISSIONER
At the request of numerous friends
and citizens of his district, Harry D.
Massoni of near Kismet has decided
to enter the race for county commis
sioner from the Third district, sub
Ject to the Democratic voters at the
August primary. While we are not
personally acquainted with Mr. Mas
soni, we have heard some very com
plimentary remarks about him during
the' past week He has many friends
In his district who have pledged him
their support and votes during the
coming campaign, and they are not
all Democrats, either. He has lived
at his present location about 10 years
and Is one of Seward county's pros
perous and Influential farmers and
cattle raisers. He Is a good business
man and the affairs of the Third dis
trict will be well taken care of dur
ing the next two years if Intrusted to
him. Mr. Massoni intends to wage
an active campaign for the .nomina
tion and election, and that' he will be
successful in both is beyond a oubt.

FOR CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT
' The Democrat will now Introduce
to, you, ladies and gentlemen, our
.handsome and dashing young friend,
Chas. M. Tucker, who aspires to be
clerk of the district court for the
next term, subject to the will of the
Democratic voters at the August pri
mary. Charlie Is a "native son" of
Seward County having been born
near Liberal In the year of our Lord,
1893. He Is a graduate of tho Lib
eral high school and an' excellent
young fellow In every reanec. For
the last several months he has been
making an assault with Intent to
study law In the office of County At
torney Commons, and the way he has
handled several cases in polka and
Justice court as prosecuting attorney
has made several of the older legal
heads sit; up and take notice. His
father, the late Judge H. V. Tucker,
was known in his time as one of the
best attorneys In the county, and the
way Charlie has taken hold of things
Indicates he Is a chip off the old
block. The office ot clerk of the dis
trict court would not be entirely un
familiar to him should he be elected,
and we believe that by the time he
took active charge of the office he
would be thoroughly familiar with all
the different angles ot the same. His
candidacy is worth serious consid
eration by the Democratic voters of
the county, and we hope they do the
handsome thing by him In August
and November.
FOR PROBATE JUDGE
J. W. Campbell, Judge of the pro.
bate court of Seward county, Is a can'
didate to succeed himself tor the
nomination to that office. The Judge
has been a resident ot this county
ever "since you and I were young,
Maggie," and only the sand hills in
the north end of the county remem
ber when he first landed here. How
ever, he hasn't been holding office all
that time, but spent a number ot
years farming and in other pursuits.
He has been probate Judge for three
terms and promises to stick as closely
to the Job during the next term If
elected as he has lir the past. So far
as we know the affairs of the probate
court have been handled satisfactori
ly during his tenure of office, and the
Republicans have our permission to
renominate him at the August, pri
mary, provided he will agree to take
the same medicine he has handed to
countless others during the past live
years, that is get married.

The addition to the rear of the
Feinberg store Is being rushed to
completion and it Is hoped to have
the same occupied in a week or two.

the best lighted stores in town, as the
rear will consist of two 10-foot plate
glass windows and one 4-foot glass
door. Not only that, but Mr.' Fein
berg figures on putting In a lighting
system whereby the natural c.i'.ors ot
clothing will be shown at night as
plainly as In the, daytime. The store
Is handicapped at present by lack of
room for the stock carried, but when,
completed it will be one ot the large,'
commodious establishments of the
town.

"Community Welfare in Kansas" and
Director Department ot Rural Ser-
( vice, Kansas State Agricultural Col

"Kansas Leads," and when the Ag
ricultural College secured Dr. Burr
It did so because he was known to be
a national authority on community
and civic welfare. How to develop
the community Into a trade, social,
religious or educational center will
be his theme. The Agricultural Col
lege has three men on the road giv
ing Dr. Burr's lectures. This shows
you that the demand for his ser
vices is far beyond what he is able
to rendeY.
Everyone Is urged to make it a
point to attend one or more of these
meetings. As a speaker he Is Inter
esting and pleasing, and at the same
time delivers a message that Is not
forgotten In a day.
Dean Sampson was here on busi
ness and shaking hands with old
friends the first ot the week. Mr.
Sampson Is now traveling for a paint
concern and Is thinking strongly ot
establishing headquarters In Liberal.
The Sampsons have lived here before
and the people of Liberal would be
glad to see them return.
