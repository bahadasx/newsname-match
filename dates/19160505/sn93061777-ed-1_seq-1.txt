Burns Is Secretary '
Frank S. Burns has again been
elected secretary of the Clovis
Chamber of Commerce, which
position he has held for the past
two years. His services have
been satisfactory and it was
thought that since he was fa

served without compensation,
that he should be again employed
in that capacity under the re
organization which was recently
effected. Frank is every i.ith a
booster and if given a fair
chance will make good.

INTERVENTION IN MEXICO
NOT PROBABLE AT PRESENT
The Mexican situation has
undergone a marked change in
the last day or two and it does
not appear that intervention,
which a few days ago seemed
unavoidable, will come at pres
ent The first news was to the
effect that the conferees of the
American and Mexican govern
ments were unable to agree.
The Mexicans were said to have
demanded the immediate with
drawal of the American expe
ditionery forces and the Ameri
cans insisted that the de Facto
troops must either co-operate
with the American forces in the
effort to capture Villa or that
intervention would result: In
tervention meant war. For a
few days there was a stir of
military men over the country.
A column of American troops
four miles in length moved
across the border. The National
Guards in Texas, New Mexico
and Arizona were ordered to
hold themselves in readiness.
Officers away from their posts
were ordered to return to duty,
it is said, and the situation look
ed serious. Now it looks differ
ent. The Americans have back
ed down to a certain extent and
an agreement is said to have
been reached whereby the pur
suit of Villa will to left to the
Carranza troops. The Ameri
cans are to gradually withdraw
land to be careful not to otter any
offense to the civilian population
of Mexico which might hurt
their feelings. The Americans
are to stay for about two months
gradually withdrawing towards
the border if Villa is not caught
in the meantime. On the other
hand the Mexican commander
PROMISES to do all in his power
to hunt down the bandits and to
use fully 25,000 troops in the
chase. It is further stipulated
and agreed, hewever, that the
American and Mexican troops
are to co-operate in the effort to
stamp out banditry in n orthern
Mexice. In this effort it is
agreed that the American troops
are to first fall back to San An
L
H
tonio, then to Guerrero, then to
Namaquipa, then to Colonia
Dublan and then to the border.
By that time it is expected that
Villa's body will have been de
composed. The retirement of
the Americans will be dignified
and contingent upon the effec
tive co-operation of the Mexi
cans. If the Mexicans fail to.
carry out their part of the agree
ment, we may yet fexpect some
thing interesting to develope.
Put on the Paint
Rush the can tlie paint can.
Lets paint up the town. We
don't mean to paint it red, but
any appropriate color. Now
that the mayor has designated
the Clean up day, let everybody
designate May as the paint up
month. If every person in this
little city of ours will do his or
her duty in the clean-up and
paint-up campaign the change
will be wonderful and we can
point with pride to the fact that
we live in Clovis, Curry County,
New Mexico. If you don't need
paint, use a rake, a broom or a
bonfire; any thing to clean op
the litter and brighten up the
hornps and help make Clovis
shine.
Splendid Rains
Th? general rains durinpr the
pnst. wceK have often siiiiie pro
ducers. Everybody wears a
smile as they have been a great
benefit to all interests. They
came at the right time and the
amount was sufficient at this
time for all purposes. Such
rains at this time are the most
important to this section as this
is generally considered the dry
season. We are sure to recei ve
good rains a little later and with
the moisture now in store, it
means that we will be threaten
ed with bumper crops this year.
Not alone will the farmer rejoice
but it means money in the
pockets of the stockmen. Al
ready the grass is several inches
high and it will no longer be
necessary to feed.
