Our Anniversary
One year ago this issue appeared my first announcement
of a new drug store for Ekalaka. On this the anniversary
of the announcement. I wish to thank my many customers
for their very liberal patronage, a patronage that convinces
methat our title "The Reliable Drugstore" is a consistent
one and that our Store has in addition become "The Peoples
Drug Store". Watch this space for the announcement
next week, meanwhile we are the headouarters for all
seasonable items in the drug line.
Respectfully,
The Reliable Drug Store

of Ekalaka were in town Monday
inspecting the local flour mill

of a mill to grind in, so that it
may be more easiiy transported.
The foundation of the mill, which
is to be three stories, is already
built, and the superstructure will
be pushed. Mr. Phelps is a bro
ther of Mrs. H. F. Brown, and

Contributed Report of The '
Sunday School Convention.
The first Fallon County Sunday
School convention met in Ekala
ka April, 28-30. The first ses
sion opened on Friday at 10.00 A.
M. with a Song Servie followed
by a Devotional Service conduct
ed bv Rev. W. S. Bowden who
had driven 20 miles and was on
time. Both services were soul
inspiring.
An address on the Importance
of Bible Study in the Sunday
School was given by Rev. R. D.
Osterhout, Général Secretary of
the Montana Sunday School Asso
ciation. The benefits of the Sun
day School to the world and its
moral effect on the nation was
shown.
"Wherever the Bible has gone
it has sweetened the home, exalt
ed womanhood, sanctifiid the
cradle and sedeemed men."
The speaker quoted Rosseau
who said. "You could not have
such a reaction as a French Rev
olution in England because there
the Bible is so universally read an
believed." 4,000,000 persons have
been added to our S. S. within
the last 4 years and of these
1 1-4 million were men.
Mrs. Frank Thompson brought
out the needs and benefits to
the S. S. and Community, of a
Musical Association. Here is
surely a chance for some persons
of musical qualification and whose
hearts are full of music to the
overflowing to fill a demand for
musical instruction. An old fash
ioned singing school could accom
plish much. V
Mrs. John Oliver's address on
Graded Lessons recommended
them for the younger classes.
The discussion which followed
favored their introduction.
The failures when they occur
in the use of the graded lessons,
seem to be due to the unprepared
teacher or else to the lesson noc
being fitted to the pupil.
General Secretary:
Graded lessons commence in
October, and the Sunday Schools
that are wanting to adopt the
graded lessons should secure the
booklet on Graded Lessons—its
purpose and scope. This would
help the teachers to get in har
mony and sympathy with the
Graded Lesson so when adopted
they will be a success. In the
beginning the graded lessons cost
more but the cost is less in the
long run because graded lessons
can be saved and used again.
Mrs Oliver:— How can teach
ers be convinced that they can
afford to take time to prepare for
their classes?
General Seccretary:—Efficient
service is always preceded by the
preparation period.

Whatever the understanding,
alj other things being equal, the
prepared person has a vastly
better chance that the unpre
pared.
Paul said to Timothy, "Study
to show thyself approved unto
God a workman that needeth not
to be ashamed rightly dividing
the Word of Truth."
The unprepared teacher will
have neither the confidence of
self nor class that the prepared
teacher has. One of the condi
tions uf easy control is thorough
preparation of the lesson by the
teacher so that it can be made
vital to the pupil.
The teachers training for ser
vice is now so pratical that there
is no excuse for a teacher to con
tinue unqualified.
A correspondence cource can
be taken. Moniger's Training
for Service costs 30c. When You
have completed the course you
will receive a diploma signed by
the officers of the International
Sunday School association. For
information concerning the corr
espondence. examinations, and
diploma, write to the Montana
State Teacher Training Dept.
The Bible School is the richest,
ripest and most responseble field
of active service within the
church today.
Three classes of people ought
to be in the Teacher Training
class for service: —
1 All teachers and officers that
"are' now at work in the Bible
School.
2. All young people from 16 yrs.
of age and cider.
3. All persons who desire to
know more of the Bible that they
may better instruct their children.
A farmer's wife in this state
has taken the First Standard
Training for Service Course.
She and another lady is now tak
ing by correspondence the Ad
vanced Course.
Teachers should see that God
needs them in the service.
When you have visited the
home and secured the co-opera
tioh of the parents and gotten all
in sympathy with you it is then
easy to secure home study."
Friday evening, Joseph Pope,
Supt. of the Montana Anti-Saloon
League gave an address on Booze
or Business. The speaker held
that no person has the right to
to engage in any buainess where
by he can live upon his fellow
citizens without giving him use
ful service in return, because if
I he should this would bring stffer
ing and want to some of them.
Thus ended the first days session.

was baptized in the Church at
Ekalaka. ihe funeral services
were conducted from the church
Tuesday at 2:30 p. m., a very
large number of friends and ac
quaintances attending to show
their love and respect for the
deceased. The floral offerings

fine. The sermon was delivered
by Rev. W. S. Bowden of Sykes

need, Its source. Its demonstra-1
tion and Its realization." The

Stock Inspector Robinson, the
horses were located a short dis
tance from Colony, Wyo. and in
possession of James. The animals
were taken in charge by Robinson
and returned to their rightful
owner at Ridge while the prison
er was taken in hand by the
sheriff. James was arrested and
her:tried in Sturgis, S. D. last year

" Not on your life, we gave those
fellows a chance once at James,
who got out by acting crazy, but
this time Montana wiil have its
say." James we understand, says

horses, dosn't ever remember of
