TENTATIVELY AGREE
ON STANDING ARMY
Republicans Say Nitrate

WASHINGTON, May 4. Con
ferees on the army reorganize-tii-i,
t ill lato today disagreed on Im
portant features of the measure and
adjourned until mutters l.i disagree

The rocks on which the -onunlttee
broke were the federal volunteer army
and tho $ I o, 000,000 tjoveriiment ni
tiate plant uiiioiidnicnts adopted by
the senate.
Notwithstanding tho disagreement.
Senator Chamberlain, chairman of
the senate conferees, said tonight he
bud hopes that a good bill eventually
would be worked out.
'"The house conferees would not
jield to tho senate provision for the
volunteer urmy or the government ni
trate plant," said the senator. "There
are u number of minor points in the
bill also which are in disagreement,
but the main points seemed tnus far
to 1x3 the only Irroconciliuble feu

Gives Ollt Stllll'llll'l't.
"Representative Hay has prom
ised to return the nitrate plant amend
ment to the house for further instruc
tions, lie rlatly staled, however, thut
the house would not uecopt the volun
. teer arir.y and the eenme conferees
would not recede. In view of the ap
parent impasse the conference ad
journed not to meet again until an
irflort is made to Kct dinner instruc
tions from the house. We do not cx
I (i t to take up the disputed p lif ts
in the senate at this time because our
ciinlere-.'S arc onuniinoiis uuu the sen
ate has already passed on the sub
Jet is in controersv."
I'p to the time of tho break, which
had been forecast, the conferees had
tentatively agreed on a standing
army in peace time of luO.OUo men,
forty thousand more than the house
bill carried and an ehtstie organiza
tion scheme contained in the senate
bill which would provide for expan
sion In time of war or threatened war,
to :'20,()(l(i men. They also had agreed
to the house bill reorganization plan
for the national Kiiard which would
provide for federalization of this re
serve force and Its expansion to ap
proximately four hundred thusand
men.
Karly is the day Iteprescntatlve

section of the senate bill with Presi

derstood to favor it ullhotiKh no state

ference. DiM'iiHs 1 'cat tires.
Representative Hay also discussed
with the president the nitrate plant
feature and the president insisted that
It should be left In the bill. This atti
tude of the president Is understood to
have precipitated tho disagreement
today.
If the president continues to Insist
on the nitrate plant provision, It was
declared, another clash between the
executive and the house would ensue.
Republicans are standing solidly
URiilnst the nitrate provision. Insisting
that it Is being urged by a "water

night, however, there was no ground
for the charge that the Water power

WASHINGTON, Muy 4. Secretary Laiislnx announced laic today Hint

bassador Ix'lifvcs would constitute (ierniuny's reply to the American note
on submarine warfare. Secretary liiiiiHtiiic declined to make nubile ibe ,IU.
patch or any part of Its content or to suy what the indication was on the
ground that the dispatch was highly confidential.
The dispatch was Immediately scut to President Wilson. The secre
tary explained it was not certain thut Amlmssador ticiurd s deductions were
absolutely accurate as he had not seen the text or Germany's reply.
In spite of Secretary Ijinsinffs Hat refusal to discuss the contents of
a dispatch received loduy rrom Ambassador Gerard, it Itccainc known lato
today that In view of such information as hud liccn received, orriclul and
liiiofficial, orrtcials of the government fear thut (iciinanv has alliiched con

continue diplomatic relations.
Germany's manifesto of February 8 to tlie principles ot which i)r-ss
dispatches rrom Iterlin indicate the Imperial government udhctvs in its
reply to the American note is assumed by olficials of Ibe slate deparinient
to he the memorandum of that dule, dcclariuir that in futuiv all armed
merchant ships or Is lllgerent nationality would ho considcreil wursliins sub

While officials would not comment on the Iterlin reference to the
niunlfosfo of February 8. they reiterated thai the president was prepared
to stand unalterably by ibe nosltion taken in ih.. i... ',..'
which was designed to permit or no urgu t. gave noli.v that unless Urr'.

WASHINGTON. May 4. Ger
many's reply to the demand of the
United States for Immediate abandon
ment of present methods of sub
marine warfare, delivered to Ambas
sador Gerard today, was awaited by
officials of the Washington govern
ment with expected tension. They
were without any definite idea of
what the communication contained. A
brief message from Ambassador Ger
ard as well as press reports, however,
had created the impression that the
imperial government would propose
conditions which the , United States
could not accept.
It wag reiterated that President
Wilson stood unalterably by the posi
tion declared in the note to Germany:
Abandonment of present submarine
methods must be declared and ef
fected Immediately or the United
States must sever diplomatic rela
tions. This was designed to permit or
no argument and high officials re
peatedly have asserted that anything
short of a literal compliance would be
followed by a diplomatic rupture.
Tho officiul copy of the note hurdlv
will reach Washington before tomor
row night, but the document was
given to the press in Berlin late today
ana tne unoitteiai text was expected
to reach tho United States curly to
morrow morning.
Ambassador Gerurd's inessuge was
sent before he had examined the note
Itself. Its meaning was not entirely
clear becauso of errors In transmission
of the diplomatic cipher.

until three days after Kitchen an
nounced his resignation.
Mason Is a Socialist. Throughout
the day he was busily engaged in

Democrats and Republicans are
disgusted with the unusual law but
have decided to muke the best of it
and be on the safe side. In most of
the precincts only a small per cent
of the legal voters have yet regis

Say America Renews
Cession Negotiations
for Danish
Report Follows Repeated Conferences of Constantin
Iiiun. Danish Minister, With Secretary Lansing; Au
thentically Rumored That Danish (lovernment Is Fi
nancially Embarrassed; Tentative Moves Have Reen
Made in Matter Several Times Refore.
w
ASH INGTo.V May 4. Several
mlnisti'i', to the state deportment for extended conferences with
Secretury Lansing, the latest being this afternoon, have given color to a
report that the American government nun renewed the negotiations that
have been conducted spasmodically and ut long Intervals for the last 25
years looking to the cession of the Danish West Indian islands, St. Thoinaa,
St. Croix nnd St. John, to the United States.
Moth Secretary Lansing and Minister Itrun refuse to discuss the sub
ject, but it is recognized that such un attitude would of necessity be ob
served in initial stages of any negotiations of tills kind.
Intimations have come to Washington recently that the Danish govern
ment itself, embarrassed by serious labor troubles which hnve occurred
in the West Indies resulting ill curtailment of revenue and making neces
sary appropriations by the home government, would not be averse to re
opening the negotiation for the cession of the group where they lapsed
fourteen years ago.
Secretary llav on January 24, 19011, signed a treaty with Minister Rrun
to transfer 'the Islands to the United States for $5,000,000. Tho United
States senate upprnved this convention as did the lower house of the Dan
ish parliament, but opposition developed in tho Danish upper house und
the treaty failed of ratification there by a vote of 31! to 82.
From that date until recently mere nan neen no orrieial move In the
matter, but from time to time certain individuals, animated, it is supposed,
bv the prospect of a commission for their services, have made unofficial
efforts to sound out both governments ami renew the negotiations.
The present state or pre-occupauon or some or the great Kuropean
powers, who are believed to have influence In the past to prevent acquisi
tion of the islands by the United States, it is suggested, probably had Its
effect in causing the subject to be taken up at this time.
