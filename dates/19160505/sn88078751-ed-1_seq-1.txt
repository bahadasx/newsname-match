dream of an Irish republic.
In a cell not far from the scene of
Che execution sat Sir Roger Casement,
a prisoner in the Tower, awaiting

toe plainly heard In the solitary prison"
room of the knight, who was arrested
a few days before the rebellion broke
out, while attempting to land arms
toom a German auxiliary on the Iri3h
coast.
John Redmond, leader of tho Irish
Nationalists, appealed to the govern
ment not to treat unduly severe the
masses concerned in the revolution

TJlsterite leader, political foe or Red
mond, but co-operating with him
throughout tho rebellion Indorsed the
nationalist chief's appeal by saying:
"No true Irishman will call vengeance
upon the mass of insurgents."

QUITS UNDER FIRE
Chief Secretary Birrell Subjected to
Bitter Attack.
London, .May 4. Augustine Birrell,
chief secretary for Ii eland, has hand
eu in his resignation. Piemier As
qrlth promptly accepted It. Bin ell
e. plained he was laying down his of
fice upon having been assured that
tlM insnrreUiou in Ireland had been
quelled. "Xo other com so is open to
n.e," he said. "The unanimity of Ire
land is preserved. This was no Irish
rebellion."
Subject to bitter attack In parlia
ment and in the press from the mo
ment of the Dublin outbreak, Blrrell's
pobltlon had become untenable. Tho
chief griovance against him was that
tho day the rebellion broke out he
hed assured tho government and par
liament thEt. they could take It from
fcim "the situation is well In hand."
1hc attacks grew in scope and in
fervor as the rebellion spread through
the week instead of subsiding, and
there were many who blamed him di
rectly for tf.e whole situation.

By Poller Players Basis Of
Butler's Scandal
PROVOKES MANY LETTERS
Of an Anonymous and Scurrilous
Character Which Were Relayed
Via Mt. Vernon Success of
Class Causes Heart
Burnings
Butler, O., May 4 The resolve of
a group of men of Butler to spend
their Sunday afternoons at Sunday
school Instead of sitting in a poker
game, has caused a flood of scurrilous
anonymous letters that has stirred
the village population of 800 and has
started investigation by postofllce au
thorities. The poker players, numbering at
least twenty men, including some of
tho leaders in tho village, formed a
Bible class. The Sunday afternoon
poker game had been regarded as a
weekly rite for many years. The men
renounced the game in a body and
unanimously joined tho new devotion
al activity.
Five peoplo prominent in the vil
lage havo been targets for the letters
which wero written in a hand re
sembling that of a man well known in
tho community. The envelopes were
addressed in a feminino hand, villag
ers say.
Tho letters are attributed to heart
burnings caused in two of the village
churches by the success of tho class,
organized in the Methodist ProteB
tant church by tho erstwhile poker
players.
Tho class prospered greatly from
the beginning. It Beomed to exercise
a strong appeal on tho men of the
village, even luring some who were
known as not enthusiastlo hr church
attendance. ''
Members of "years' standing of the
two other churches began to drift
from tholr allegiance and to gravi
tato toward tho Bible class begun by
tho reformed poker players. This, it
Is said, aroused jealousy in the two
rival congregations.

Pittsburgh, May 4. Coincident
Mith the appearance of state troops
iu the Turtle Creek and Monongahela
valley stiike zones, came the an
nouncement fhat Patrick G I hi ay. chief
of the state bureau of mediation and
arbitration, has ai ranged with Pres
ident K. M. Kerr of the Westinghouse
Klectric and .Manufacturing company
for a meeting xvitn the mediation com
mittee of tho strikers from the allied
Westinghouse plants. This definite
action following Tuesday's reign of
terrorism, in which two men were
killed and a score or more seriously
Injured in a clash with deputies at
the Edgar Thomson steel works,
Braddock, leads to the belief that a
Ffittlement of the difficulties hetwee.i
labor and capital In this district Is
not far away.
With tho arrival of state troops, bjg
plants which had shut down rather
than court violence at the hands of
the unrestrained mobs which have
been continually on the go In all sec
tions of the Turtle Creek and Monon
gahela valleys during the past threo
days, announced that they would re
open. Among hese concerns aro the
Edgar Thomson steel works, Brad--dock;
the Rankin and Braddock
T.lants of the American Steel and
Wire company, and the Mesta Ma
chine company, West Homestead.
Ton men suffering from wounds re
ceived in the rioting Tuesday, and
who are believed to have been ring
leaders in the mob that attacked the
Edgar Thomson guards, were ar
rested. Regular Republicans Win.
