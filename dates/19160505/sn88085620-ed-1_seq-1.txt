Initiative Bills to Be Explained
at Open Meeting in Labor
Temple This Evening at 8
Members of Everett trad" unions,
their families and friends should not
fail to attend the mass meeting to be
held in the Labor Temple tonight to
discuss the four iniiative measures
now being circulaed by organized
labor. Tbe practical use of the in
itiative and referendum in state-wide
affairs is on trial in this state. The
opponents of Direct Legislation have
said from the beginning that the peo
ple generally would not make use of
this method of legislation and there
fore sought to hedge it about with
burdensome restrictions to make sure
that they wouldn't.
It is not so long ago that we have
forgotten the legal battle of two years
ago to prevent the Seven Sisters from
going upon the ballot. Nor the still
more recent effort of large employ
ing interests to enjoin us this spring
from circulating petitions upon two
of tbe measures now up for considera
tion. There must be some reason for
this attack. If big business is so
mightily interested in blocking this
proposed legislation, it is a good sign
that there is somehing in the wind
that you ought to know about.
These bills are either good for you
or they are bad. In either case you
ought to know something about them.
Men who have made something of a
study of them will discuss them at
the meeting tonight. A well-known
Seattle speaker will explain he non
partisan bill, the measure the stand
pat politicians are so touchy about
and which numerous stand-pat politi
cal conventions have denounced in
highly explosive language.
Everett citizens have cause to re
member tbe part the state Public
Service Commission played in stalling
off a decision in the water and light
rates complaint brought by the Trades
Council. No doubt >ou were heartily
sick of the dilatory tactics of that
Commission. How the people of ja
municipality could take regulation of
public utilities into their own hands,
if initiative bill No. 22 became law,
will be told by Attorney R. J. Faussett
of this city. Mr. Faussett fought the
legal end of this case cited without
thought of monetary reward and
knows what he is talking about. Other
speakers will explain tbe remaining
bills.
Don't make any other date for this
night. Bring along the women folks
of your family and hear this dis
cussion.
WANT IRON MOLDERS ENJOINED
Philadelphia.—The American En
gineering company discriminated
against active union iron molders and
a strike was called by this organiza
tion after the management refused to
discuss the matter wih union repre
sentatives. The company now finds
it is losing $5,000 a month besause of
Wheeling, \V. Va. Union plumbers
for relief. It wants an injunction—
the awe-inspiring kind preferred.
WHEELING PLUMBERS STRIKE
Wheeling, W, V*.—Unoln plumben
are on strike because their employers
insist that wages shall be paid by the
hour instead of the day or half day.
The bosses want conditions fixed so
that when they call for plumbers, and
i hen find they are not ready to work
them, the employe will be paid only
lor the time he is actually employed.

METAL WORKERS MAKE GAINS
Joplin. Mo.—Machinists and iron
moldsrs have won strikes for in*
proved conditions. In both cases
wages are increased to $4.25 for a
nine-hour day.
Have the workers received a fair share of the enor
mous increase in wealth which has taken place in this
country during the last twenty-five years, largely as a
result of their labors? The answer is emphatically NO!
The wealth of the country between 1890 and 1912 in
creased from 65 to 187 billions, or 188 per cent., whereas
the aggregate income of wage earners in manufacturing,
mining and transportation increased between 1889 and
1909 only 95 per cent., from 2516 millions in 1889 to 4916
millions in 1909.

UNCLE SAM PAYS LOW WAGES
Washington. — Hearings by the
house labor committee on the Nolan
bill shows that appropriations by
congress have increased from $457,
--000,000 in 1896 to $1,114,937,000 in
1916, but during this time wages have
remained the same for thousands of
government employes.
The Nolan bill was introduced by
Congressman Nolan, a member of the
labor group, and provides that no gov
ernment employe shall receive less
than $3 a day. At the hearings it
was stated that of 30,000 government
employes in Washington, 25.6 per cent
earn less than $720 a year, or $2 a
day. Outside of Washington 18 per
cent receive less than this amount.
There are 106,590 government em
ployes outside of Washington who re
ceive $1,000 or less per year. Of this
number 30,600 get less than $720.
STRIKERS ENJOINED
Bridgeport, Conn.—Judge Gager of
the superior court has issued an In
junction against strikers of the Max
Machine company in Fairfield. Ac- '
cording to the court's order, the !
strikers must not picket "or in any '
way" interfere with strikebreakers. '
The honorable court retains the right 1
to be the sole judge of what consti- 1
tutes interference. The workers show '
that if a strike did not exist, and any 1
one of them was charged with "inter- '
ference," they would be accorded a 1
trial by jury, as provided by law. In 1
this case, however, Jurge Gager is '
lawmaker, law enforcer and execu- 1
tioner.
AIDED BY BETTER LIVING
Boston. —Better living conditions is
the greatest aid in the fight agains f
tuberculosis, said Dr. S. H. Rubin of
Tufts medical school, in an address
in this city. .
"Our success in dealing with this ]
disease," he said, "may be attributed
to a modification if not a complete |
revoluton of tbe social condition of j
the people, as is evidenced by more
sanitary housing conditions, better
food and cleaner habits. Fewer cases
are now seen in the hopeless stage,
and the early cases are detected in
the incipient stage and provided with
suitable treatment "
PLUMBERS' STRIKE SETTLED

EVERETT SHINGLE WEAVERS STRIKE FOR UNION
SCALE. COMPLETE TIE-UP OF ALL MILLS FOLLOW
If Everett shingle mill operators be-,
lieveu that they had killed for all time j
the shingle Weavers' union in this i
city, they were due tor an awakening 1
and it came on schedule time. From
which it might be inferred that the
Everett shingle weavers are on strike.
They are.
One year ago a wage reduction was
posted in the mills in this city. At
that time the weavers were organized
and refused to accept the cut. A
strike ensued, which lasted for six
weeks. The wage reduction was gen
eral throughout the state, the shingle
market was weak, there were many
unemployed and the boys waged a
losing fight. Tbe fight at that time
soon developed into a fight upon the
union organization and the union was
completely disorganized. The men
gradually returned to work upon the
promise of the mill operators that
when the price of shingles advanced
the old union scale of wages would be
restored.
With the coming of spring of this
year lumber and shingles took a for
ward trend. Prices increased and the
demand became firm. But no move
was made by the local manufacturers
to restore the wage schedule. The
weavers took note of the advanced
price of shingles and began to specu
late on the chances of the mill men
making good with their promise. Re
organization of the union was affected
in various parts of the state, in Ray
mond and South Bend the boys lined
up early in the year and, directly due
to their organization, the mill men
of that section restored the union
scale nearly two months ago. The'
significance of that action was not lost
on the boys in other localities and re
organization became quite general.
The third of last April a convention
was held in Seattle, attended by near-'
ly thirty delegates. A new constitu
tion was adopted, progressive in
character and closely modeled after
that of other strong organizations. It
made tbe principle of collective bar
gaining on a business basis the key
stone of the document and made it
possible, by providing necessary ma
chinery of conciliation, to eliminate
much of the petty strikes and dis
agreements that had afflicted the or
ganization in the past. Right there is
where the mill operators should hay
begun to think. Had they looked
about, them they would have seen
other great industrial concerns, repre
senting huge aggregations of capital,
dealing with labor upon a business
basis, providing methods through
which grievances might be taken up
and fairly adjusted, retaining mean
while the respect and confidence of
the men. the most valuable asset an
employer can have.
A slight increase in the wage scale
was made by local shingle mill op
i rators recently, but the raise left the
schedule still below that in effect j
previous to the reduction of one year
| ago.
MILL OWNERS UNWISE
Conceding that the weavers have
made mistakes in the past in the con
duct of their affairs, the Journal be
lieves the operators made a grave
■mistake that they did not confer with
officials of the union during the past
week whem such a conference was

sought. What appear to be Irrecon-. 1
clliable differences between em
ployers and employes when the 1
parties stand apart and refuse to con
fer with each other, show up in quite ;
another light when demands or I
grievances are mutually discussed and
the situation viewed from all its '
angles. 1
The convention previously referred
to fixed May Ist as the date upon
which demand for wage restoration
WOUd be made. On last Sunday after
noon the large hall in the Labor Tem
ple was inadequate to hold the
weavers who met to discuss tbe sit
uation. Upon hearing that the effort
made during the previous week to
hold a conference between the mill
owners and representatives of the
International union had failed, the
weavers discussed the situation. (And
it might be said in passing that the
conference sought bound neither
party to anything. It was merely an
effort to get together to talk over the
pending demands and ascertain if a
settlement could not be reached which
would avert a strike and pave the
way for future friendly relations of a
lasting character.)
A secret strike vote was taken, in
which the men working in co-opera
tive mills (of which there are several .
in the city) did not participate. The
decision was that each mill crew
should proceed to the respective mills
on Monday morning, present their de-L
mands for a restoration of the wage
scale, and upon refusal to go quietly,
to their homes. This action was taken;
on Monday morning and upon being .
refused the men quietly left the
plants. No other demand was made
save a restoration of the scale. No ;]
picket lines were thrown out, no j (
threats made, no demonstrations of!
any kind indulged in. Significant of
the feeling of the men, however, is
the fact that with but few excep-!
tions every skilled man involved in
the strike is now a member Of the
Everett shingle weavers' union. Less ,
than a dozen men were left in all
the mills of the. city (exclusive of the
CO-operatlve mills, which were not in
volved), the strike call being an
swered practically unanimously. The
men are holding daily meetings in the
Labor Temple. They are temperate
and restrained In tin ir language and
actions, but deadly determined to win
what they are fighting for.
OTHER MILLS PAYING THE SCALE |
International officials say that i
about sixty per cent of the mills \
throughout the state are paying the )
scale asked. The entire Grays Har- f
bor country is paying the scale with ;
the exception of two small mills. The ]
entire South Bend branch is paying ,
it. FJvery mill in Edmonds and in : ,
Snohomish jurisdiction with tbe ex- ,
ception of Three Lakes is paying it. ,
All mills in Granite Falls are paying ,
it, as are all mills in Olympia juris- |
diction. Two mills are ou strike in |
Marysville and one in Mukilteo. At:,
tbe time of the writing of this article'
BallMPd mills are n ported quite gen- j
erally tied up, i<

this city, is quoted in Monday even- i
ing's Herald as follows:

crease. We shall remain closed until
I such a time as we can pet men and
do business. The men are just as
unreasonable as they can be; they
are asking the same old scale as we
paid in 1914 when times were good.
IWe are not making a dollar and
haven't made a dollar for two years
and a half (yet "times were good" in
1914), and we can't stand the increase'
in wages asked for by our men."
Contrasted with that statement is
the following clipping from the Se
attle Times of the same day and date:
PRICE OF SHINGLES RISING
"War in Europe may have weak
ened the power of many rulers, but it
has firmly established the American
shingle as undisputed ruler over the
roofing kingdom, according to Thomas
Tiates of Aberdeen. Bates operates
a lumber and shingle mill In Aber
deen and believes it better than a
gold mine. He is in Seattlte on a
business trip and is a guest at the
Frye. 'War certainly has entrenched
the little cedar shingle against all its
enemies,' said Bates. 'The price of
shingles has advanced more than
thirty cents in the last two months
and still the demand is greater than
the supply. Dealers believe that the
price will go still higher. The use of
metal in the manufacture of muni
tions is causing most of the metal
roofing materials to leave the market
entirely.' "
Local employers complain that, the
increased price of logs more than
offsets the increased price of shingles.
Just previous to the present strike
shingle cedar was selling anywhere
from nine to twelve dolars a thou
sand. Good lumber cedar was ob
tainable from twelve to fourteen dol
lars a thousand. Tbe advance in
shingle cedar was not greatly over,
the price prevailing a year ago. The
lateness of the cutting season in the
woods, due to the severe winter, ac
counted for most of the increased
price. Many camps have scarcely yet'
resumed normal cutting capacity j
When they do so, logs will lower in
price,
Anyhow, the weavers say. that if
other large plants, going into tbe
open log market as do local manu
facturers, compelled to compete for
their log supply, can pay the scale
without a murmur, log argument in
the local situation is not very im
pressive.
For the sake of industrial peace In
that, industry, upon which depends in
large measure the prosperity of the
whole community, the Journal hopes
the employers and employes can
speedily get together and work out
an agreement that will be of a lasting
nature. We do not believe for one
moment that the boys want to be un
reasonable, nor do they expect the
mills to run at a loss. They fail to
understand why the old scale was
not restored as per promise, particu
larly when so many mills in other
parts of the state paid it without a
whimper.
If the mill men will recognize the
fact that the boys are bound to be
organized and that it is far better to
have it responsible, business like body
of men o deal with, this recurring
source of friction between employers
and employed can be done away with
Stetson Hat Makers are
Forced to Rebel
Dear Sir and Brother: We are this
day forwarding you a few copies of
the .News Post of Philadelphia, Pa.,
containing an account of the reasons
which forced the employees of the
John B. Stetson Company of Phila
delphia to rebel against, existing con
ditions in that factory.
Over seven hundred of the John B.
Stetson Company finishers are on
strike for over four weeks, and sine-*
this paper was issued several hundred
women in the trimming department
have come out in sympathy with them.
The strikers were unable to get their
ease before the public, all the Phila
delphia papers refusing to publish
anything in connection with the strike
in the John B. Stetson factory. In
order to get their grievances before
he public, the strikers bought, out the
News Post and the paper is now vir- 1
tually owned by the strikers, their ]
leader being its business manager;
the copies which were forwarded to
you being the first under the new
management and is devoted almost
exclusively to the trouble in the John
B. Stetson factory.
For many years the Stetson Com
pany has posed before the public as a
model employer, giving away every ,
year large quantities of gold watches |
and turkeys in the form of Christmas ,
presents, which, in reality, were paid ,
for ten times over by the employees ,
The new edition of the News-Post ,
clearly states the grievances of the (
John B. Stetson Company employees, (
and while they are not members of (
the United Hatters of North America,
we would appreciate it very much if
you would give the matter as mhch
publicly as you can, so that the public (
may know he true conditions existing
in the John B. Stetson factory.
Fraternally yours,
