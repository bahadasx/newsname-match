PLANNING FOff
COUNTRY CLUB
ifnndsomo rosort on Bluo River on
Highway may bo tho result of plans
that nro now being formulated.
It is not Improbable that tho noxt
year or more will bco on Bluo RIvor
near tho highway, tha stto of a pry
beautiful country club, whoro moin
bors may tako their families fur an
outing, and whero thoy may fish, boat
or play golf as 'their fondeBt fancy
dictates. '
All thero is to tho. plan at this
tlmo is talk, but there must bo some
talk, and moro of it as a prolude to
every accomplishment or an Insti
tution that is worth while. Tho idea
is that a bunch of men, say a hundred
or two hundred, as it is decided best,
subscribe equal amounts, which will
bo used to buy ground, orcct the club
house, arrange the golfing links, pre
pare tho fishing g-ounds, swimming
pool, boating lakes and so on , and
got busy, which would bo owned by
tho company which this bunch or
ono hundrod or two hundred men
vould organize. Over tho country
aaro hundreds of country clubs. Al
most ovory, largo city has ono or moro
of them, and the smaller towns
getting the Idea a woll. inero aro
many towns as small or smaller than
Durant, in tho Older states, where
such institutions aro a plenty.
Just who Is promoting tho idea, or
what measure of success has thus far
bscn had, it in not permissablo at this
timo to give out.

B. .Bennett of Cado, aged 70 'years,
may thank Damp' Good Fortuno that
ho is alivo today, for tie did a thing
that few men have done and got
away -with, viz: having a head on
collision with a locomotive going at
full speod and lived to toll the
story. Mr. Bennett Is hard of hear
ing and was walking up the track
about a mile "from tho Caddo sta
tion. Number C, tho Katy Flyer,
was going in tho samo direction as
Mr, Bennett, who. by reason of his
deafness, did not hear the train's ap
proach until it was nearly upon him.
His attempt to get out of the way
was mado too late, and tho train
struck him, knocking him some forty
feet, or more, to tho side of tho
right-of-way. He was soon able to
pick himself up, and, although pain
fully cut and bruised, lo not serious
ly injured, it is reported.
In our announcement column this
issue appears tho card of W.,A. Jones
who will be a candidate to succeod
himself as court clerk of Bryan
County, subject to tho Democratic
primary August first. Later qn a
moro detailed statement of 'his can
didacy will appear In those columns.
TOM TABOR A CANDIDATE
fi.
jS-per Deputy 'Sheriff and Present
''jfiSS Policeman Wants to Be
"i$i2tetable for TwnShlp
5E.t Number One,"'
Tho News announcement column
tills week carries tho card of Tom
Tabor who aspires to become a 'can
dato for ConBtablo of Township No.
1, on tho Democratic tlcekt, subject
to t'io action of the voters of that
par', at tho Primary to bo held
August 1, 1916.
Mr. Tabor is at present employed
as ono of tho city's policemen, being
assigned to regular work, and giv
ing scrvlco said to bo ontlroly sat
isfactory both to tho chief of polico
and tho publlo as woll.
Right after Statehood, Mr. Tabor
was elected constable of Township
G, whore ho then lived. Ho served
at Kemp, and made n good record in
criminal work, and on ono occasion
captured an exceedingly bad nigger
wanted in Mississippi on two or
three murder charges. For this
catch ho got a check for $500 and
on tho Tyay homo tho nigger got a
hem-pen necktie at the instance of
an infuriated mob that took him out
of tho sheriff's hands (This part of
it happened in Mississippi.)
When Lib Hart was elected sheriff
of Bryan county ho picked on Tom
Tabor for deputy sheriff and moved
htm to Durant. Ho made a good
record in that capacity as any who
know of his work will nttest.
This editor knows Tom of long
acquaintance, and gladly commends
his claims for consideration to the
voters of this, Township 1.
SOCIALISTS
N
CLAIM DENIED
thta, secrplary,, complains, to. ;U.S.
Attorney General, that members of
that that party aro not permitted
to register.
A telegram was sent Wednesday to
Attorney General Gregory at Wask-j
Ingtpn by H. M. Sinclair, secretary
of the Sociallsht party of Oklahoma,
In which ho charged that under the
new registration, law 1,000 citizens
who aro entitled to vote have boon
refused registration in Mcintosh
County. Ho refers to disfranchise
ment of voters who aro entitled to
vote for members of Congress, tbu3
making It a Federal matter, and asks
that appropriate action be taken by
tho Government at once. The tele
gram declares that precinct registrars
met In secret and conspired to take
this action.
A report was given out at Socialist
headquarters, which covers registra
tion Incidents In several parts of the
State. In addition to the Mcintosh
County Incident, it charger rejection
of voter's in somo other places.refusal
to act in somo precincts and imposi
tion of literacy test by registrars in
other places. Reports as to nogroes
from some black belt counties are
that they aro belns refusqdroglstra-
tnon on tho ground that they did
not vote in 1914.
CREOSOTE BLOCK PAVING
Local peoplo who have interested
themselves in tho paying of differ
ent streets in the city aro Inclined
to favor tho creosote block to any
other form of paving, for tho reason
that it .furnishes as durable a paving
as asphalt or brick, at a little less
price, and with still the nolsless fea
ture that Jb characteristic of Trini
dad aspluilt. Most all of tho larger
cities aro now laying this sort of
paying In large quantities. A con
crete base is laid the same as for
brick or asphalt. Tho wooden block,
cut the size and shape of a brick,
and treated with a creosote prepa
ration, are then laid tho samo as
brick. Reports that The News has
had from cities whoro this form of
paving Is in use indicate that it is
tho most satisfactory of all kinds of
paving laid.
GERMAN REPLY THUR8DAY
News dlspatchos of Wednesday,
evening's city- papers indicated that
on Thursday of this week tho Gor
man government would band tp
American Ambassador Gerard tho
German reply to tho Amorlcan ndtb"
demanding cessation pf present tac

ment concerning the, natureof tho

WHAT ABOUT GASOLINE PRICES
State . officials, especially the Gov
ernor and tho attornoy general be
llovo that Oklahomans are being dis
criminated against In tho price of
gasoline, and preparations are bolng
made to attempt ,to force tho prlco

ters, wo are Informed. Prices said
to bo In effect In several middle
western cities ore as follows: Kan
sas City 18c, Fort Worth 20d,' Chi
cago 21c, Oklahoma City 25c. It Is
felt that In Oklahoma -whero a largo
part of tho world's supply of crude
oil Is produced, that the prlco of
tho finished product should at least
bo as low as in cities farther away
from tho production.

GUARANTEED INFERTILE EGGS
, A local grocery store Is selling
eggs put up in dozen size cartons,
which aro guaranteed to be infertile,
and with th warranty that any bad
or spotted ogg found therein will bo
replaced with a good egg free of
charge. They sell at a small ad
vance over the market, and most
every egg eater, that patronizes
this store has taken to buying the
infertile eggs. The idea is carried
out by soiBo-Bort of an egg club- that
has its origin In the community.
Each member of the club gathers
tho eggs, puts them in the cartoons,
and places his or her name on the
tbp before delivering them to the
grocer. All the patron has to do If
a bad egg is found is to report to
the grocer tho name of the person
on the cartoon, and tho fresh egg Is
immediately forthcoming. The idea
Is good. It will work In the dis
tribution of many other things be
sides pggs.

MORE SCHOOL FACILITIES
ARE BADLY NEEDED
The Durant School Board has real
ized for. some tlmo that It will not
be many years until the city will
of necessity have to provide moro
and better quarters for tho use of
the schools. Each room in all of
the four buildings now in use is
crowded to capacity, and In one In
stance we are Informed it is neces
sary to crowd really moro seats into
the rooras than the room can readily
accommodate. The number of chil
dren in attendance is on the in
crease each year, and now tho scho
lastic census has reached the two
thousand fark or thereabouts. It
has been suggested by several peo
plo that the city vote bonds in a
sufficient amount to erect a new and
larger "high school building, and
then, use tho present high school as
'a Fourth Ward Bchool. Tho added
school building would take -care of
tho situation for several years to
conj. Local taxpayers had as well
prepare to voto bonds, as it is not
long until this thing will havo to be
done.
Now tolephono directory goea to
press May 6th, 1916. Make applica
tion for service today and havo your
name Included,
