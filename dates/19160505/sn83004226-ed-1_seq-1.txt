This sounds tolerably scientific, but
when you get down to the analysis of
It many of our readers will be surpris

times a day In pretty nearly every ar

quantities or salt are dally used at the
Louiaa Chemical plant In the produc

course there are some other things be-
irfe hvdrurhtnrio which are used to
eonvert the "Ite" Into the "ate" or In
other words changing the chloride Into
the chlorato of sodium. It Is no secret
that large quantities of hydrochloric
are used In the production of this val

The Louisa Chemical plant has a de

pool of her own blood that flowed from
a gaping wound In the side of her
head, which had been beaten almost to
a pulp, and with portions of her brains
scattered about" the room, Mrs. I'er
mella Jordan, aged 26 years, was found
dead on the floor of her home In Mor
ris Lane, at "Flat Woods," two and
one-half miles east of Lucasvllle Tues
day morning, the victim, it Is supposed
of an atrocious murder.
Neighbors made this ghastly discov
ery when they rushea to tne rarm
house In response to an alarm given
by Jim, a 13 year old son of the house
hold. While the neighbors stood about the
room, still appalled by the gruesome
sight before them, the blood bespat
tered walls, giving evidence of a ter
rible struggle, the woman's husband,
Roy Jordan, came upon the scene. He
had been out in the field, milking cows,
and professed ignorance as to how his
wife had come to her death.
George, aged 7 years, and Fred, axed
I, the youngest children of the family,
Were playing about the house, pathet
lcally unconscious of the tragedy that
had Just been enacted almost before
their very eyes.
The scene of the tragedy is a newly
completed 6-room, story and one-half
frame house that rests on the bank
Just off the Morris Lane road. To reach
it from Lucasvllle one must go up the
first road that turns off to the left, for
a mile un the lane post the Flat
Woods church. The JoriMtn farm con
sists of eighty acres of land, owned by
Mr. Jordan, who, with his family came
to that locality four years an from
Lawrence-co., Ky. His wife's maiden
name was Foster.

neighborhood and waa regarded as
above the average small farmer In the
manner in which he looked after his
financial affairs and Interests general
ly. The two older boys attend the Flat
Woods school and since school closed
Its term some days ago had been help
tng their father about the home place.
The first man on the scene waa
near neighbor, William Skaggs, who
bad been asked to come to the home
of Mr. Jordan. Skaggs found Mrs. Jor

Joining the kitchen of the home. He
could see that she was dead although
he did not go close to the body. He
later went to the Otto Fields home,
and Mrs. Fields notified Undertakers
Hartman A Son. She had previously
been Informed of the death by the wo
man's young son, Jim, who came to
the house and said that his father
wanted her to come to the bouse, as
Mrs. Jordan was dead.
Mrs. Fields was feeling 111 and could
not go. Her husband waa not at home
at the time, but even after learning
what had happened, did not venture
near the Jordan home. When asked
why. he said he did not wish to get
mixed up in the affair.
Roy Jordan formerly lived at Tus
cola, this county, where he kept a store.
He Is a son of Wash Jordan, and his
wife was a daughter of James Foster,

OLD CHURCH BUILDING
BEING TORN AWAY
WORK OF REMOVING OLD EDI
FICE OF M. E. CHURCH
SOUTH- BEGUN.
i.
What was probably the last preach
ing service 'ever held in the old M. E.
Church, South, was conducted last
Sunday by the pastor, the Rev. L. E.
McEldowney. The service of the morn
ing was so closely identified with the
service of the evening that they might
almost be considered as one. Both ser
mons had their reference to the build
ing of the new edifice. In the' morning
the pastor had for hifc theme The As
cension, it being the last in a series of
discourses on the Important events
connected with the life of Jesus, he
having heretofore preached concerning
His birth. His Introduction into the
temple. His betrayal, Hla crucifixion,
Hia resurrection. There was special
music, adapted to these services and
the pastor made several allusions which
fit very well to the building of the new
edflce. At night he spoke of the build
ing of King Solomon's temple, reading
as the lesson the 6th chapter of 1st
Kings, and he told graphically of the
labor connected with getting out the
proper timber and the proper stone and
its transportation from Lebanon where
the cedar grew and the carrying of
the huge blocks of stone to Jerusalem.
He then read as a text the 25th verse
of the 26th chapter of Exodus which
told of the building of the Ark of the
Covenant He clothed the details of
that great work with language and
Imagery which lent new beauty to what
always was an Instructive and absorb
ing subject Very apt references were
made by the preacher throughout his
discourse of what he hoped and what
he believed the character of the con
templated new church should be.
If any were present who had not been
much interested In the subject which
engrossed the speaker they surely must
have been much Interested in thia im
portant matter after listening with
great attention to what was sold.
There were many expressions of re
gret that the old house would probably
soon be no more and this feeling waa
but natural. All, however, seemed con
tent with the new order of things which
will soon be Inaugurated.
Near the close of the morning ser
vice the Infant daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Dave Thompson was baptized by
the pastor.
Mr. McEldowney announced among
hla regular announcements that for
thia week at least and possibly longer
the Wednesday night prayer meeting
and the Bible Class would be held In
the lecture room. Aa It Is now arranged
the Sunday school and preaching ser
rice, beginning next Sunday, will be
held in the court house.
Work of removing the wood work
and floors on the inside of the old
building waa started Monday morning.
Plans for the new structure to be erect
ed on the old site are being made by
Charleston architects. As soon as com
pleted ' the church board expects to
proceed as rapidly as possible with the
work of building.
