COMMISSIONER WEST ATTACKED
An action was filed in Judge Ut
ter's court this week -accusing Peter
A. West, chairman of the board of
county commissioners with the col
lection of illegal fees and salary
when he attended the state meeting
of the county commissioners at Hel
ena during the latter part of Janu
ary, 1915.The hearing is set before
Judge Utter on May 11th. The com
plaint was sworn to by Peter Peter
son, a farmer living near Glasgow
and secretafy of the Taxpayers
League, of which Hon. Dan McKay
is President. Slattery & Kline are
the attorneys for Peterson.
We are informed that a similar
charge was filed against one of the
Chouteau county commissioners two
years ago. The case came up before
Judge Tattan who threw it out of
court in that county, holding that the
expenditure was proper and jusifi
able.
NEW PROPRIETORS
FOR MODEL BAKERY
T. A. Hauge Sells Out to Havre Men,
Will Retire from Business.
T. A. Hauge has sold out. Last
night at twelve o'clock he turned over
the keys and business of the Model
Bakery & Cafe to Hubbert & Bufton,
who purchased the stock, fixtures and
good will of the institution.
The Model Bakery and Cafe has
been doing a splendid business, and
it is not for lack of patronage that
Mr. Hauge is retiring from the busi
ness, but the strain caused from over
work and the labor problem, caused
him to accept the high offer made
him by the Havre men, who are now
in charge of the place. Mr. Hauge
has no definite plans for the future,
except that he will take a long need
ed rest, by making a trip of several
months duration. He wishes to ex
tend his thanks and appreciation to
the many customers who have been
with him for the past few years and
urges them to continue being Model
Bakery patrons with the new owners.
Realizing that Glasgow is destined
to become the big city of northern
a
Montana, Messrs. Hubbert & Bufton
p a jd a big price for the Model Bakery,
but they know the business is here
and under their management hope to
extend an d build up the institution
begun years ago by Mr. Hauge.
Both Mr. Bufton and Mr. Hubbert
are experienced cafe men, acting as
managers of the Great Northern
Lunch room in Havre before coming
to Glasgow. Mr. Bufton has manag
ed and owned cafes all over the
country and knows the business from
A to Z, and it is his intention to give
the patrons of the Model Bakery &
Cafe the very best of everything
coupled with service that cannot be
excelled.
HOMESTEADER SUCCUMBS '
Oscar Nordrum, a homesteader liv
ing four mileB east of Baylor, died
of diptheria suddenly last Thursday
afternoon, after a short illness.
He had been feeling ill for a week
past, but not until Thursday morn
ing did symptoms of the malady
which carried him away become ap
parent, says the Baylor World. Dr.
Smith of Glasgow was sent for im
mediately and every means of saving
his life that lay within the grasp of
human hands was employed but to
no avail, and he died before the doc
tor arrived.
The body was brought to Glasgow
and prepared for shipment east at
the Peterson Undertaking Parlors, j
Monday the body was shipped to
Rothsay, Minn.
ACTION DEFERRED
The matter of the creation of the
Hinsdale special water and electric
light improvement district was taken

BASE BALL GAME
NEXTSUNDAY
Glasgow Regulars Will Play the
Fast B. of R. T. Team.
CLOSE GAME IS EXPECTE»
WUI be First Opportunity for Fana te
See the Glasgow Team in Action.
Many New Players in Lineup.
Glasgow fans will have their first
opportunity of seeing the Glasgow !
team in r.cticr. next Sunday, May 7th, |
when the B. of R. T. team will take
the field against them. While this
game is not on the regular schedule,
it is consi<?4 red important for the
reason that it will leave thé champion*
ship in a muddle, should the Train
men win. Big Bill Harvey, the fam
ous heaver, whose name has long been
a terror to batters from Whately to
Buford will be on the mound for the
Rails and he has perfected a new
curve which he expects to use against
Fischl's Regulars on Sunday. He
calls it the "Air Brake" ball, and it
works after the principle of the air
brake on a train. Bill also has a
floater which he calls the Great
Northern Flyer and this will probably
fool the batters.
The other eight men on the BOFRT
team are all ball players and many
ave been up in the big time. Spike
Harvey is slated to play the initial
sack, and a few years ago Spike and
Hal Chase were fighting it out for
first honors as the best first base
man in the country. Spike lost out
by a narrow margin, as his railroad
work interfered with his ball play
ing. Other players on the G. N.
team are Art Kelly, catcher and
"Shoes", second base, who were the
stars of the Rumely team two years
ago. Walter Fryer has been getting
into shape for the game the last week
and he may be used as an extra base
runner. •
The Glasgow team will be in fine
shape for the game Sunday. ThejW.
boys have been given several goo
to
at
j
to
workouts this week und their show
ing ii\ practice has been of a high
order. They have oeen hitvu'-'j the
pill on the ;^se in batting practice
and their fielding and pegging has
beer, of mid-season style. Benson
and Hurly. will be the battery for
Glasgow and it is probably unneces
sary to state that Benson has no love
for the Trainmen, as he still remem
bers the harsh treatment accorded
him last season when he worked as
assistant helper in the roundhouse, |
and when he was given a free show-1
er while dozing in a cab. Benson
hopes to get even Sunday and will J
make Bill Harvey go some to put
the game on ice. Hurly expects to
have the best season of his career
the coming summer and has been fig
uring up the home runs he is going
to hit. His batting average is al
ready above a thousand and he ex- 1
pects to try out a few new bats Sun-1
day to land on Harvey's curves. His J
work back of the bat also shows im- !
provement, and base runners are
warned not to try to steal when Hur
ly's iron arm is on the job
The lineup of the Regulars will be
as follows:
Benson, pitch.
Hurly, catch.
Herstrom, first basé.
Thomas, second base.
Movold, short stop.
Bardill, third base.
Bretzke, center field.
Wright, left field.
Hocking or Kelly, right field.
"Scoop", scorer.
Jim Aichele, announcer.

BAND HOLDS REHEARSALS
Twelve members of the Glasgow
band turned out for rehearsal at the
Commercial Club rooms Tuesday night
and a very good practice was had.
F. S. Shoecraft was elected to act as
director by the members of the band
and he took the boys in hand and
seemed to be getting along nicely.
Another practice was held last night
in the basement of the south side
school house and it is the present plan
to hold two practices a week until
the boys get in trim.
Through the efforts of Secretary
Moore of the Commercial Club, the
school board is giving the band boys
permission to use a large room in the
basement of the south side school
house, which will serve as a band hall
for the time being. Anyone who plays
any band instrument and desires to
become a member of the band, is in
vited to be present on any practice
night at 8 o'clock sharp. The band
has received an offer to play at Op
heim on the Fourth of July and there
are several other prospects for the
summer. They plan to turn out for
the opening game of the season with
Nashua on the 14th.
NIFTY TAILOR SHOP MOVES
Another business change of im
portance occurred this week when
Messrs. Hollenbeck and Klee of the
Nifty Tailor Shop bought out Buller
Bros. The Nifty Tailor Shop is now
located in the quarters formerly ( ac
cupied by Buller Bros., where they
! have larger and better facilities for
| handling the increase in business they !
have been enjoying.
a
I
The new shop has been remodeled j
and is now one of the finest in north-.
.em Montana. There is a large re
aeption room % displaying woolens
and taking measurements, and back
of this the workshop where Messrs.
Klee and Hollenbeck, make, repair,!
press and clean clothes. They «till
have their dry cleaning plant in con
nection with the Glasgow Steam Laun
dry.
They are deserving of the patron
age they have received from the peo
ple of Glasgow and it is their plan
to give their customers the very best
service and workmanship at all times.

RUMOR STARTS LAND RUSH
About forty north country farmers
I arrived in the city last night and this
morning and filed on land, under the
impression that the 640 acre bill had
passed or was going to pass in Con
j gress and that the State was going
to relinquish its right to the l«t«i
selected by it in the vicinity of Glen
tana.
The source of the rumor is not
known, but it started yesterday when
the people in Glentana heard that
some Scobey parties were looking at
land on the state reserve getting ready
to file. This started a merry rush
and every rig and automobile in tiie
town was out yesterday with a load
of landseekers. Nearly everyone Of
those who have filed already possesses
320 acres of land.
The land office officials state they
have heard nothing to the effect that
the bill has passed, or was going to
pass, or that the state would give up
its right to the land. Even though
the 640 bill did pass, the land that
the people are selecting is the best
on the state reserve, and would not
not come under the provisions of the
bill. The land must be rough and fit
only for grazing purposes before it
can be filed upon as a stock raising
homestead.
But whatever the outcome, the land
rush is creating a little excitement
and bringing marjv people to town,
and as one farmer expressed it, ''this
is our Fourth of Jaiy celebration."
NEW COMMODITY
RATE FOR GLASGOW
New Freight Rate Big Inducement for
Wholesalers to Locate Here.
Notice has been received at the
local office of the Great Northern,
that by a special ruling, Glasgow has
been given the same special tariff
commodity rate that Havre, Great
Falls and Fort Benton ■ have. This
special tariff rate will apply to all
freight shipments out of Glasgow and
is known as a distance tariff, apply
ing to local shipments, and is of es
pecial benefit to jobbers and whole
sale houses It means that shipments
from Glasgow to customers in towns
east and west of here, within the dis
tance covered by the new rate, will
save from three to nine cents a hun
dred on all shipments.
Putting the new rate into effect,
establishes Glasgow as a jobbing cen
ter with the railroad and makes this
city a particularly desirable location
for other wholesale and jobbing con
cerns, for it will enable them to car
ry a large stock for distribution out
of Glasgow to points in northeastern
Montana. The benefit will jreally
come to the city through the increased
advantages offered to wholesalers to
induce them to locate here.
POWER SITE DISPUTED
A dispute is likely between Phil
lips and Blaine county pver the pos
session of the power plant territory
on the Missouri river. The Malta
Call claims that the surveyors do not
agree as to the line and that there
is 110 doubt that the plant is in Phil
i H P s count y
It will be remembered that at the
be 1 time of the Secrest murder, a dispute
| ltrose as to whether the murder was
;> n this county or in Phillips county,
j The country along the Missouri in
that section has not been surveyed
and no one knew just where the line
ran. Judge Tattan ordered the
county surveyor of Blaine county to
