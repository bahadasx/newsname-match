That statement outlined the Ger

it asserted ' that the British and

of armed merchant vessels to at

possible, and that in view of this
action on the part of the Entente

Would Sink All Armed Merchantmen
GERMANY announced that she proposed to stand upon her
formal statement issued February 8, last. That statement
outlined the Teutonic policy regarding submarine warfare.
'VI Mr. Wilson in his address to congress on April 19, explained
what that policy was as follows;
."In February of the present year the imperial German gov
ernment informed this government and the other neutral govern
ment of the world that it had reason to believe that the govern
ment of Great Britain had armed all merchant Vessels of British
ownership and had given them secret, orders to attack any sub
marine of the enemy they might encounter upon the seas, and
that the imperial German government felt justified in the circum
stances in treating all armed merchantmen of belligerent owner
ship as auxiliary vessels of war, which it would have the right
to destroy without warning.

have been one of -perturbation At

lieved that the oeonle were stand

without sacrificing the principles
of the German note of February

PREVIOUS BERLIN
DESPATCHES GAVE.
HINT OF RUPTURE
Previous despatches from Ber
lin indicated a decided difference
of opinion in Germany. The
ultra-militarist faction, which in
cludes the naval, was inclined to
believe that the best way of set
tling the present difficulty with
the United States and puttintr to
an end for all time any question
of the right of Germany to con
duct her undersea warfare as she
sees fit, would be a break with
Washington, even if that break
led directly to war.
Other Faction
Favors Yielding
The other faction, and it is a
large one, apparently stood back
of the efforts of the imperial
chancellor to avert further trou
ble between the two countries.
