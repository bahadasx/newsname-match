ROARING COMEDY
MAY 13
"The King of Timbuctoo" in all
his glony will hold court at the
Star Theater Saturday night, May
13, when the Lordsburg Harmony
Club, under the direction of Miss
Elizabeth Girrett, will present the
musical comedy bearing the name
above quoted. The club has been
working hard to perfect this big
3how, which will doubtless eclipse
any local talent show ever given
here. Whether or not they have
succeeded will be evidenced next
week.
There will be unusual comedy,
lots of singing, good dancing, and
music the best ever. Several of
Miss Garrett's compositions will
be introduced for the first time.
To hear these new selections alone
will be worth the price of admis
sion. The trials of the King of Tim
buctoo in his quest for a happy
woman are sidesplitting. Slick,
the theatrical promoter and his
wife, the professor and his wife
and the Irish Piper will be in at
tendance at the Royal Court. For
the amusement of his' kiddies
Charlie Chaplin will come off the
reels long enough to aid in the
search for the happy woman. The
beauty chorus is a stellar attrac
tion none should miss. "Ginger"
js on deck and many other char
acters tend to make one of the
best shows ever staged here.
The date: Next Saturday night,
April 13. Thirteen has no horrors
for this aggregation.
