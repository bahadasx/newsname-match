Extract From German Note in Which
Germany Yields to Wilson's Demands
"The German government notifies the
government of the U. S. that German naval
forces have received the following orders:
"In accordance with the general princi
ples of visit, search and destruction of mer
chant vessels recognized by international law,
such vessels, both within and wit'iout the area
declared to be a naval war zone, shall not be
sunk without warning, without saving human
lives unless the ships attempt to escape or
offer resistance."
BY ROBERT J. BENDER
United Pre** Staff Correspondent
\\ \>HINGTON\ May 5.— \ general feeling of satisfac
tion with the German reply to the United States, received
this morning. is apparent here The consensus of opinion
here is that the submarine issue practically is closed.
At a cabinet session lasting two and one-half hours.
President \\ il- >n and his advisers considered the unofficial
te\t of the I'rfrman note.
When the meeting ended there was no question but that
the situation was viewed with optimism.
President Wilson's final decision is not expected until late
tomorrow.
German Ambassador Von Bernstorff. accepting his gov
ernment's rrply as satisfactory to the United States, will
call at the state department early next week to take up the
matter of "British violations of international law" mentioned
:n the note.
Yon Bernstorff plans to point out that the United States,
in it< note, assumed the role of an upholder of international
law. no matter where violated. He will call attention to
British violations.
It is the belief of officials that the ambassador will no<
find a receptive attitude at the state department.
Senator Hughes of New Jersey called at the White
House after reading the German note. He said he waa
"pleasantly surprised."
The opinion of other callers was, like Hughes', that the
president should accept the offer of Germany as given in good
faith.
A high government official.
Intimately in touch with thf sit
uation, said after a careful pe
rusal of the reply:
"Germany appears to have
made great concessions I do
not see where there is any
thing at present that would
Justify a break. Germany has
gone much farther than earlier
reports would have Indicated."
May Bring New Issue
It was pointed out that Germany
has Issued an order that meets the
American contentions.
If Germany later, because tbe
t'nlted States falls to bring Great
Britain to meet the German con
tentlons. rescinds the order an
nounced today, there will be a new
Issue for the I'nlted States to face.
This has no part In the present
situation. It was said.
On the other hand, some officials

"The German government handed
