BRIDGE BONDS SELL WELL
County Supervisors Sell Entire
Issue of Bridge Bonds Voted
Last January for Good Prem
ium Transact Other Important
Business.
At the regular monthly meet
ing of the board of county su
pervisors held Monday and Tues
day, considerable business of
importance was transacted, chief
of which was the sale of the
$63.000 worth of bridge bonds
voted by the taxpayers last Jan
uary.
About a dozen different bids
had been submitted, the best in
the opinion of the board being
that of James N. Wright of Den
ver. G. B. Gray represented
Mr. Wright, whose bid was for
the entire issue, his offer being
par, accrued interest and $775
premium. This bid was accept
ed by the board, and as soon as
the bonds are printed, signed and
delivered, the money will be
available for use.
The road commission appoint
ed by the board at the April
meeting met with the super
visors Monday and orgaized by
the election of Frank Ellsworth
chairman and R. B. Walton
secretary. The commissioners
decided to start on a trip over
the roads of the county May 15.
The work of inspection" will be
completed by the time the su
pervisors hold their regular meet
ing in June, at which time the
commission will report to the
board.
Upon the report of the road
commission will depend the a
mount of bonds called for in the
road bond election petitioned for
by the taxpayers a short time
ago, which election will probably
be called at the June meeting
of the board. This commission,
in addition to recommending the
aggregate amount needed, will
advise where the money should
be expended.
Other business transacted by
the board was of a routine nature
a.nd pertained mostlv to auditing
and allowing claims against the
county. Before adjournment it
was arranged to hold a special
session of the board tomorrow
for the purpose of passing upon
some road matters.
Justice Court Cases
Mondav Judge Boyer and a
jury tried the case of the "state
against Sam Smith, charged with
petty larcency, the specific
charge being that of unlawfully
taking a cartridge belt and gun
belonging to Wm. Wooster.
Smith was represented by At
torney J. E. Jones of Flagstaff,
and a verdict of acquittal was
returned by the jury.
Tuesday the case of the state
against Sam Smith, charged with
assaulting Wm. Wooster, was
tried by Judge Boyer and a jury.
In this case Smith was represent
ed by Attorney Jones, and he
was acquitted of the charge by
the jury.
Monday Judge Boyer released
Vern Smith from a peace bond,
which he had given some weeks
ago, as a result of an altercation
between his family and Wooster.
This action was taken upon the
motion of County Attorney Jor
dan. Monday had been set by Judge
Boyer for receiving the plea of
Frank D. Gillespie, charged with
felonious assault, but owing to
the press of other business this
case was postponed. Gillespie
is still under bond and his plea
will be received at some future
date, not yet fixed.

Holbrook Defeated Winslow
The Holbrook base ball club
defeated the Winslow club last
Sunday afternoon on the local
grounds by a score of 15 to 7,
The game was witnessed by i
fair size crowd of people, a num
ber from Winslow and Snowflake
being present, in addition to the
local fans.
The contest was too one-sided
to be exciting. The Holbrook
club outclassed the Winslow club
in every particular; not only did
the Holbrook boys outweigh the
visitors, but they outplayed them
from the start. Early in the
game the Winslow club changed
pitchers but the sluggers on the
local club batted the second
pitcher harder than the first man
in the box. And most of the
men who hit the ball scored at
the home plate.
The Winslow bovs made a few
hits off of Pitcher Osborne but
the superb fielding of the Hol
brook boys prevented them from
circling the diamond in many
instances. The Holbrook boys
found the Winslow pitcher fre
quently and when they did so
they generally made safe hits.
During the game Dr. Bazell
was called twice to attend play
ers who had been injured in the
play. Jay Patterson, first base
man for the Holbrook club, was
cut in the left forearm by spikes
in a base-runner's shoes. This
injury did not put him out of the
game, nor did a hit on the back
of the head by a ball thrown from
third to home base, which he re
ceived a short time afterwards.
The second call upon Dr. Bazell
was to attend a Winslow player,
also cut by spikes in a runner's
shoes. The injured player was
taken to the doctor's office and
given surgical attention. His
place in the club was taken by a
sabstitute.
The Holbrook club has made
splendid progress since it was
reorganized, and with a little
strengthening at one or two posi
tions, it will be in shape to give
a good account of itself in any
kind of company.
Manager Kunkle has arranged
a game with the Winslow club
in Winslow next Sunday after
noon. The Holbrook club will
go by automobiles, leaving here
about noon.
