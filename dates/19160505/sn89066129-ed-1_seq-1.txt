AUSMUS BOUND OVER
Preliminary Held Before Justice
Garside Last Saturday
The preliminary of Win. Ausmus
charged with assault with intent
to kill A. G. Groes a few weeks
ago, was held before Justice Gar
side at the opera house last Satur
day afternoon. A large crowd was
present. Groes has so far recover
ed from the four shots that he was
present at the hearing and was the
only witness examined. The state
was represented by Prosecuting
Attorney McKinney, assisted by
Geo. Calhoun of Laclede, and H.
J. West of Brookfield, the two lat
ter being employed by the Groes
family. Attorney C. C. Bigger
represented the defendant.
The account of the shooting
given'by Groes was practically as
given in The Blade three weeks
ago, Groes stating he would have
shot Ausmus as he approached the
Groes home had his gun worked.
As a possible motive for the
shooting the attorney for the de
fense brought out the following
incident: Some time last fall,
Groes, who is a grocery merchant,
called at the Ausmus home to de
liver some goods. He took them
into the kitchen where Mrs. Aus
mus was making pumpkin pies.
As he passed near her he stuck his
finger in a slit on the shoulder of
her dress, remarking that she was
wearing a dress with a hole in it.
She, in apparently good humor,
grabbed a piece of pumpkin and
told him to go on or she would hit
him with it. He stated he passed
on and considered the incident
closed as Mrs. Ausmus continned
to call at the Groes home and at
his store to trade.
Ausmus was present at the hear
ing but was not put on the stand
and no testimony was taken on be
half of the defendant.
After hearing the evidence Judge
Garside announced he would hold
Ausmus to the June term of the
circuit court, and he was released
on one thousand dollar bond signed
by his sister, Miss Rena Ausmus
Is a Worthy Candidate
Mrs. Flo Carr, candidate for the
republican nomination for county

short while last Saturday. She

Carr's first visit to this township
but she found her candidacy had
many enthusiastic supporters over
this way who will continue to give
her earnest and loyal support
daring the campaign. To meet and
converse with Mrs. -Carr' is to be

15000 GALLONS OF OIL
To Be
Used on Laclede Streets
Early Next Month
The committee having in charge
the street oiling proposition met
Tuesday and went over the sub
scription list, and while they are
still short about one hundied dol
lars of the amount needed, they
felt so sure it could be raised that
they contracted for two cars of oil,
15000 gallons. This will cover
about twice as much territory as
was treated last year. The present
unusual rainy season has demon
strated beyond a doubt the value
of oiling and Laclede proposes to
take no backward step but to ex
tend the good work into new terri
tory and ultimately have every
road leading into Laclede in good
condition and . oiled. As soon as
the subscription lists are complete
they will be published in The
Blade showing just who has con
tributed and the amount given,
The intention now is to do the
oiling about June 1.
