Must Meet Demands of the
Military Authorities,
He Declares.
Ijondon, May 5.—Speaking on a mo
tion to reject the military service bill,
.David Lloyd-George, minister of mu
nitions, said in the House of Commons
that he would rather be driven out of
the Liberal party, even out of political
life altogether, than have upon his
conscience the responsibility of refus
ing the demands of the military au
thorities for men, which might make
all the difference between defeat and
victory.
Those who asserted that If the war
lasted until 1917 the nation could not
"stay the course," were both inac
curate andd injudicious. He had con
sulted the leading financiers of the
oountry, and they had not the least
hesitation in affirming that however
long the war lasted, it could ptitst&y

AMERICAN INDIAN
DAY DESIGNATED
Albany, N. Y.. May 6.—A procla
mation Issued by Governor Whitman
yesterday designated' May 18 as
American Indian day "for observance
by the descendants of the first
Americans in memorial and honor of
their forefathers." The governor in
vited the attention of the citizens of
the state "to the history, the social
institutions of these people, and es
pecially to the present and future
needs of the 6,000 reservation Indians
now resident in this state."
The day will be celebrated by In
dians throughout the country, but, as
far as known. New York'is the first
state officially to recognise the pro
posed observance. Exercises will be
held in Indian schools and reserva
tions, and preparations have been
made In numerous white schools and
communities for considering the mu
tual Interests, friendship and destiny
of the two races.
The idea of celebrating Indian day
was adopted by the national confer
ence of Indians in Denver in 1911.
The date for the celebration—the sec
ond Saturday in May—was not fixed,
however, until the Lawrence, Kan.,
conference last October.-

New York, May 8.—Count von
Bernstorff. the: German ambassador,
left for Washington on the 1 o'clock
train, after haylhg received a wire
less telegraph eppy of the text of the
German note.' •. He denied himself to
interviewers.
It Is known, however, that the
German embassy's view is that the
note contains all for which the Unit
ed States asked, and that it signalizes
a return to what has been termed
"cruiser warfare'—that is. the opera1
tlon of submarines as cruisers, inter
cepting commerce with visit and
search. The embassy view is that in
asmuch as no mention is made in the
note of the question of armament it is
not a complicating feature.
New Tork, May 5.—Count von
Bernstorff, Gentian ambassador, re
ceived a note -by telegraph' from the
Sayville wireless station in his suite
at the Rits Carlton hotel. His only
companion wa# his secretary. Dr. Fritz

Port Au Prince. Haiti, May 5.—The
Haitien cabinet has resigned. Parlia
ment has entered a protest with the
American government and congress
against what it declares to be a viola
tion of the rights of the legislative
branch of .the government.
President Darti^uenave of Haiti and
his cabinet have been in controversy
with the Haitien parliament over the
course to be taken with regard to
the framing of a. new constitution to
conform with the treaty between
Haiti and the United States. The
president and the cabinet, according
to a dispatch from Port An Prince
on April 29, threatened to resign if
the deputies and senators declined to
abide by the presidential decree dis
solving the senate and persisted In
continuing to assume legislative pow
ers instead of meeting merely as a
body designated to frame the new
constitution.
Rear Admiral Caperton command
ing the American forces in Haiti, took
a definite stand In support of Presi
dent Dartlguenave when the legisla
tors refused to accept the dissolution
decree, Which the admiral held to be
valid, a later dispatch declared.

Washington, May 5.—The unofficial copy of the note
fore the cabinet. The one chief point for consideration to be
Germany's reference to immunity of "merchant vessels recognised by
international law."
This is regarded as having the possibilities of relating to a dis
pute over the questions of armament and the alleged lnstraotfons at
the British admiralty to merchant captains to attack submarines.
The first Impression in official circles was that the fall test did not
much relieve the unfavorable impression created by the opening por
tions, although it Is. admitted that the new instructions to
commanders would have to be weighed and considered
before their acceptability by this government could be
When the cabinet session ended. Secretary Lansing met all Inquiries
with this reply:
"I cannot disease the note at all at this time/*
SOME INDICATE AN ACCEPTANCE.
All other cablnct members made a similar statement. It
plain that President Wilson would decide after studying the official
text, and while final decision on the attitude of the American govern
ment waits on the official text, some cabinet members this afternoon
indicated that-the German assurances probably would be accepted,
and that diplomatic relations would not be broken unless the osder to

GENERAL TENOR CNSAHSFACTQRX.,
The general tenor oir the German note, however. Is
unsatisfactory-. There Is some disposition among the presidents'ad
visors to believe that no drastic steps will be taken unless new orders
to submarine commanders are violated or modified.
As the cabinet members left, the white house several Indicated their,
view that the Vnited States would have to wait to see whether the new
orders to submarine commanders were carried oat.
NO DECISION TILL NEXT WEEK.
Washington, 91a 5.—At the state department after the cabinet
meetlng, It was stated that no "hasty" action would be taken on the
German note, and that in view of its length and the necessity of digest
ing It carefully, it "was improbable" that any decision would be
reached before next week.
SOME PAPERS DECLARE GERMANY SAID "NO.""
New York, May 5.—Press comment, on the German note generally
seemed to oonsidcr the German reply ms unsatisfactory, some papers
taking the position that the German emperor had said "no*' to the
American demands.
Washington. May 5.—President Wilson and his cabinet went oare
fully over the German note as transmitted in news dispatches from
Berlin this morulng. First feeling that it was unsatisfactory was
somewhat lessened by the text of the new orders to submarine oon- ...
manders, although It is foreseen that reference to tuMMmiiy for ntsr
chant ships as recognised by international law might admit of aooss
dispute of Interpretation. So much depends upon the words and their
shades of meaning Involved In translation from Gennan to "^dilii that
no decision can be attempted until the official text Is In the pndtaitfs
hands. Ambassador Gerard cabled that he had started It on the
cables last night. It ought to be in Washington tonight or early to
morrow.
Two views are current In official circles. One is that
has declared her Intentions of abandolning her
submarine warfare as demanded by the president, and that
can government might have to wait to see whether the
will be effected.
The other view is that the Vnited States, hsdM
nee wftfc
ed to have Great Britain give up Its interference
meroe ahd having told Germany that it cannot discuss
negotiations with Great Britain, has no coarse bat to break
matlc relations with Germany.
While the general tone of the Gennan note created an
able Impression, officials took the position that the langnage Is
rial If the guarantees are real.
Germany's declaration that she has Issued new orders to
