No school system is complete without
h kindergarten. The following paper
by Mrs. Iva L. Dorroh, read before the
P-rent Teachers' Association tells of
the advantages of tLis department of
school work.
ADVANTAGES OF THE KINDERGARTEN
In one of the New Orleans kinder
gartens, this incident occurred a small
boy of five seated in a little red kinder
garten chair, looked up at the visitor
with grave interest as he asked this
question, "Have you got any chil
dren?" "Oh, yes," answered the
lady, and with the idea of satisfying
what she thought was friendly curiosi
ty about her little boys, she proceeded
to give him some information concern
ing them, when he interrupted with
"Why don't you send them to this kin
dergarten then?" Thus the kinder
gartens are advertised by loving little
friends.
Incidents that go to prove the kin
dergarten is the brightest and happiest
experience in the lives of the children
are constantly happening.
There is no doubt of the value of the
kindergarten from the child's point of
view. We continually hear people say
that they understand its philanthropic
importance; but what of it from an
educational standpoint? In answering,
first, let us call to mind just what
powers and qualities are necessary to
the child for success in school life and
in his later and larger experiences out
ofschool.
Certainly be needs strong body
and a clear mind, both of which he can
use to good purpose. He must be alive
to what is going on around him, be
able to give clear expression to his
ideas, not only in speech, but in many
other ways. He must ahapt himself
readily to his environments, to people,
circumstances and things, and to make
application of the knowledge he gains
but in order to do this, he must have
acquired certain habits of body and
mind, the acquisition of which later on
in his life, will be impossible.
enly Father, has made all of tnese
things for us.
If it comes to be a natural thing for
the child thus to associate and rever
ence the best tnings in his experience,
this means much for his later religious
life. There is usually a song known ss
the "Thank you song" that the child
ren sing a simple expression of grati
tude for certain good gifts.
"Unconscious learning is the best."
The things we've always known-
learned we know not where or how
stav bv us are Dart of us. This is
characteristic of the knowledge the
child acquires in kindergarten. It
comes to him unconsciously through
his play. Let me give a few illustra
tions which will show that the kinder
garten provides the child with daily op
portunities for the exercise of certain
powers and the acquirement of certain
definite ideas.
Often" a child will ask that a special
song be Bung, and the teacher miy
suggest that he first tell to the others
the words of the song and in a natural
child-like way, without any self-con
sciousneBS. he will reoeat the one or
two verses often without a mistake.
No one is urged to do this it is a
ready response to a suggestion is in
no way regarded as showing off, but
rather as a contribution to the pleasure
of the whole group.
In the same unconscious way they
learn something of numhers. The
counting of children present finds a
place in each day's program. One
child goes the rounds as all stand in a
circle and gently touches each one,
while they all count in concert. In
many of the games a certain number
of children must be selected and the
older ones are quick to notice if a mis
take is made and can tell how many
must be dropped or added to make the
desired number. .
If the telling of a story is part of
the morning exercises, there will be
great interest and concentration of the
older children, and later on in the day,
you will probably Bee them giving
back, in some form or other, ideas they
have gotten from the recital. Every
day the children give expression to im-
by modeling with clay, in
is
l he kindergarten gives the child

given l tie child through play, and
through his child interests. You will
have noticed in your visits to kinder
gartens, tnat the children are not kept
sitting long in one position. After
fifteen or twenty minutes they are
marching, skipping or exercising in
Borne playful way,
harly each morning, in the kinder
gartens, the children and teacher
gather in a sociable looking circle in
the center of the room, where they
join in singing some greeting song,
They sing good-morning to each other,
and sometimes to the play-room with
its bright pictures, and almost alv
to the sunshine, when it comes in at
the windows. In this age of hurry-life,
often there does not seem to be time
even for the conventional "How do
you do?" Has not this part of the kin
dergarten an educative value? Besides
acquiring certain habits of politenejs,
there are many opportunities for the
starting of right habits in other direc
tions. The kindergarten teachers are
careful to make the putting away of
playthings, the picking up of scraps,
an interesting and important part of
each day's work.
The kindergarten is preeminently
social institution, and its influence on
the children in this direction, cannot be
too highly estimated. Because they
are constantly cooperating with each
other in work and play, we find them
growing in unselfishness and helpful
i x I i i m .
ness ana tnougni ior otners. Let me
give you the opinion of one of the
mothers of a New Orleans kinder
garten. She says, "I think the best
help Edward has had is that of making
him less selfish, and that comes from
associating with other children, He
waa the only child, and was so selfish;
he would not give any of his things to
anybody, or even let a child touch
them. Now he wants to take his toys
(this he actually does every day) to
the kindergarten 'so,' as he says,
'other children can play with them,
too. "
The feeling of frendliness, of com
munity, Froebel believed, was the
very first beginning of all true reli
gious spirit. The religion of a little
child has nothing to do with creed, or
doctrine, or dogma. Froebel taught
that there is a pathway from every ob
ject in nature up to God. So besides
trying to bring about this feeling of re
latedness to other people, the kinder
garten endeavera to strengthen the lit
tta child's natural love for the beau
ties of nature, the flowers, the birds,
the butterflies, the stars, the clouds,
the sunshine, and to associate with this
love, the thought tbat God, pur Heav-
r'eiisinnn

thing.'
The plan in the kindergarten
always to choose subjects of real inter
est to the children and then provide
various means for the expression of
this interest.
There is something particularly
broadening to the kindergarten student
in her preparatory work. The con
stant contact with little children calls
out the best that is in her, and she has
daily opportunity to work out educa
tional problems and to put in practice
her educational theories. She comes to
realize that it is not ehough that a
teacher be well informed as to the sub
jects she is to teach, that it is even
more important that she understand
her pupils: understand! how to make
subjects and tasks appeal to them
know how to rail forth their best effort,
and how to enter sympathetically into
their interests. '
The first kindergarten in America
was opened in 1868, and since that
time the institution has been variously
regarded-by some as a fad; by some
as a charity; and by others, and the
number of these is constantly increas
ing as a great educational factor. In
proof of this we have the constantlv
increasing number of private and pub
lic school kindergartens, and the testi
mony of school superintendents in its
favor.
A state university president, leading
some visitors into the kindergarten
room, said, "I have saved the best till
the last, for the educational principles
oi this department underlie the work
of the whole college." .

Editor of the Beacon:
I am inclosing you copies of my
Brigade and Sponsorial Staff and I hope
that you can publish it for the informa

point on my Staff only those Old Com

of the fight. Some of these have told
me they might not go to Birmingham
on account of physical inability, but I
hope most of them will meet me there
nd enjoy the Reunion at that time.

Uucle Sam's business affairs can
be told only in big figures. The
statement of the national treasury
at the close of business, April 11,
shows that the income for the fis
cal year, up to that time, had in.
creased 132,000,000 over the in
come for the same period of last
year, while the outgo for the same
period had decreased $ 13,000,000.
Last year Uncle Sam spent f 114,-
000,000 more than he took in over
the counter, while this year his
expenditures were only $69,000,
000 above receipts, making a net
decrease of 145,000,000 in the
treasury deficit. However, the
"pork" grabbers are active as
ever, and they may be expected
to do whatever is necessary to see
that the fiscal year does not end
without the customary "hole" in
"barrel. 'Jackson News.
The only man that has been I
President of the United States
who commands the admiration of
the Hon. Ted Roosevelt is himself,
hence it is not surprising for him
to condemn President Wilson's
action in consulting Congress on
the German issue as "cowardly."
There is no hope that the present
Democratic administiation will
ever do anything to please him,
because, as the Hartford Times
puts it, that "damn man Wilson"
keeps on committing the unpard
onable and unpatriotic offense of
sleeping in the Hon. Ted's bed.

After Congressman Mann had
said that President Wilson is try
ing to work up to the point where
he can get the country into a war
with Germany during a presiden
tial year, he began to hear by
wire from his constituents. One
dispatch from Chicago signed by
leading members of the Illinois
Bar Association who are Republi
cans, said: "Jim Mann is a dis
grace to the United States and the
Republican party and should be
impeached on the motion of a Re
publican." The Hon. Jim has
also read what the press of the
country has had to say of his
harsh attack on the President,
and now realizes that he has been
completely successful in torpedo
ing himself with his own mouth.
We are convinced that the
Irishmen in Dublin who revolted
against the British government
are real Democrats because the

The Columbus Dispatch truth
fully says: ''The time has come

newspaper and periodical when
the man who does not pay will
have to be cut off. News stock
has advanced fifty per cent and
with the stock scarce and still
advancing. Inks have advanced
enormously and every factor in
the making of a newspaper has
had a corresponding advance. In
many instances newspapers and
magazines are advancing the

In speaking tditorally of Presi

others have said in a column. It

President Wilson has taken the
path of right, of honor and of

Four years ago the Legislature
pissed a statute providing for the
use of the Torres system, and,
like many other measures enacted
by our lawmakers, it is a dead
letter on the statute books.
Perhaps the chief reason why
the Torrens system, which Is un
questionably the ideal plan of
preserving land titles, has never
been employed is the fact that it
was not made compulsory by our
Legislature.
In fact, it is doubtful if the
average lawyer of chancery clerk
knows that such a law is on the
statute books, and, if he is aware
of the fact, few of them have taken
the trouble to acquaint themselves
with its provisions.
The Torrens system is both sim
ple and inexpensive. It ought to
be brought into general use.
