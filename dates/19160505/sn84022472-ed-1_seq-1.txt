TEXT OF GERMANY'S REPLY TO U. S.
'Berlin, May 5, by wireless to Sayville, L. I. -Following is the text of the note of the
German government in reply to the American note ; respecting submarine warfare, de
livered on Thursday by Gottlieb vn Jagow, the foreign secretary, to Ambassador Gerard:
The undersigned, on behalf of
the Imperial German govern
ment, has the, honor to present to
his excellency, the ambassador
of the United States, Mr. James
W. Gerard, the following reply to
the note of April 20, regarding
the conduct of German subma
rine warfare:
The German government hand
ed over to the proper naval au
thorities for early investigation
the evidence .concerning the Sus
sex as communicated by- the- gov
ernment of the United States.
Judging by the results that the
" investigation , has hitherto yield- '
ed, the German government is
alive to the 1 possibility that the
ship mentioned in the note of
April 10 as having been torpedo
ed by a German submarine is
. actually identical with the Sus
sex. - ' ' '
The German government begs
to reserve further 'communica
tions on the matter 'until certain
points are ascertained, which, are
' of decisive importance for estab
lishing the facts of the case.
Should it. turn out that the com
mander was wrong in assuming
the vessel to . be a man-of-war,
the German government will not
fail to' draw Jhe consequence re
sulting therefrom.'
In connection with the case of
the Sussex the government of the
;r United States made ;. a series of
statements, the gist of which i3
the assertion that the incident is
. to be considered but one instance
of a deliberate method of indis
criminate 4estru;tion ' vessels
of all sorts, nationalities and des

restraints upon the use

in consideration of neutrals' inter

John P. Wagner ,a Jitney driver, liv

wrecked his handsome new automo
bile and 'barely escaped serious injury
to himself, when at least one of "'his
four passengers was hurled through a
windshield as ' his car skidded into a

As 1 learned today : from - various
sources the party had left a Stratford

headlights of another i automobile
blinded Wagner. His car skidded.
As the radiator struck '. a telephone

car but did not suffer Serious wounds.
The unconscious woman, well dressed
and wearing a wedding ring, was

to physicians met with .refusals to

No such consideration has ever
been shown neutrals by Great
, Britain and her allies.
The German submarine forces
- have had, in fact, orders to con
duct the submarine warfare In
accordance with the general prin
ciples of visit and search and
the destruction of merchant ves
sels recognized by international
law7 the .'sole exception-being the
conduct of warfare against etiemy
trade carried on enemy freight
ships encountered in the war zone
surrounding Great Britain. With
regard to these, no assurances
have ever been given to the gov-
v ernment of the United States. No
such assurances are contained in
the declaration of Feb. 8, 1916.
The German government can
not admit any doubt that these
orders were f given or are ' exe-
cuted in good faith. Errors ac
tually occurred. ' They can in no
- kind of warfare be avoided alto-'
- gether. - Allowances ymust be
made in the conduct of naval
warfare against an enemy re
: sorting to all kinds of ruses,
whether permissible or fllicit.
But apart from the possibility ,
of errors, naval warfare, just like
- warfare on land, implies una
I voidable, dangers fop. neutral per-
y sons and goods . entering the " .
fighting .zone.' Even ,in cases
where the naval- action - is con
i fined to ordinary forms of
' cruiser warfare, neutral persons
and goods repeatedly come to
- grief. . " .
The - German government has ;
repeatedly and explicitly pointed
out the danger from mines that
have led to he loss of numerous,
ships. ' , I ' '
The German 'government has
made several proposals to the
government of the. United" States ',
in order to reduce to a-'minimum A
for American travelers and goods
the inherent dangers of naval ;
warfare. Unfortunately, the gov
ernment of the United States de
cided hot to accept the proposals. ; v

agreement along 'these lines.
- As the German government re
peatedly declared, it cannot dis
pense with the use of the subma
rine weapon in the conduct of
warfare against enemy trade.
The German government, how
ever, has now decided to make a
further concession adapting
methods, of submarine .war to the
interests of neutrals. J
. In reaching its decision' the
German government is actuated
by consideration of the reasons
which are above the level of the
disputed question.
The German government at
taches no less importance to tHa

than the government - of the
United States. It again -fully
takes into account that both gov
ernments for many''' years co
operated in developing the law inN
conformity with those principles,
the ultimate object always - being
to confine warfare ' on sea and
land to armed forces of bellig

though these considerations ' are
of great weight, they alone would

the German government: . For
answer to the appeal by the gov

the German government must
"repeat once , more, with all em
phasis, that It was not the Ger

The sartorial display in the tailoring

Harry dressed his. shop window so
attractively this morning that an au

the car. His chauffeur was driving
west on Stratford avenue this morn

ed its position and left. It wheeled
around, so to speak, and traversed -25
yards to Harry's shop where it nestled
down-, among the gents" furnishings
after smashing a few windows.
The action of the wheel was both
funny and uncanny to those wffio

smoothly, as if directed, from the car

WOTTTJD GO TO DENMARK
Richard R. Scharff of this city ap
plied' this morning to ITaturalization
Clerk Flanagan for a passport to Den
mark. He -aid he wanted to make a
business trip here. His application
was sent , to the State department in
Washington -
Germany's declaration that she has
issued new orders to submarine com
manders not to attack without warn
ing "merchant vessels recognized by
international lawis considered the
chief , point. The German view of
merchant vessels . as defined in its
declaration of February 8, of its
purpose to sink armed ships without
warning and the American view as
defined in the armed ship memoran
dum made public recentlv diffor- in
sevek-al, points. ,
SoVne-officials believed that for this
reason the .controversy had now come
to the point where Germany's future
action would determine the course of
the United States. , The refusal of
the German 'government to openly
admit the attack on the Sussex was
considered only incidental to the
main issue. Untn President Wilson
himself has decided whether the Ger
man note is acceptable there will be
no announcement of i the attitude of
the government.
While final decision , on ; the atti
tude of -..the iAmerican government
waited on the official text, some cabi
net members indicated, that the German-
assurances' probably would be
accepted and that' diplomatic rela
tions would not be broken unless the
order to submarine commanders was
violated and American lives endan
gered. ,' i
Germany's diplomatic correspon
dence' with the United States on the
submarine, issue has extended over
nearly a year and more than once
have brought the two countries to a
pass where the long expected break
seemed unavoidable. All along Pres
ident Wilson has spoken primarily for
the inviolable rights of Americans and
generally for the rights of neutrals.
Germany nas been restrained by a
powerful public sentiment aroused
against curtailing the effectiveness of
herv best weapon against her enemies
and President Wilson has . been em
barrassed first by dissension in the
cabinet and Jater in Congress and
by pro-German propaganda conducted
throughout ' the United States.
' Submarine warfare did not actually
enter the realm of diplomacy until
after the destruction of the Lusitania.
The ' accumulation of cases affecting
Americans was taken up in the first
note to Germany, which was dispatch
ed May 15, 1915. If characterized
the attacks on the Falaba, Cashing,
GulfllgK; and. Lusitania as "a series of
events which the United States has
observed with growing concern, dis
tress -and amazement." It pointed to
Germany's hitherto expressed "hu
mane, and enlightened attitude" in
matters of international right and ex
pressed the hope that submarine com
manders engaged in torpedoing peace
ful ships without warning were in
such practices operating without the
sanction of their government. The
note closed with these words:'
"The Imperial German government
will not expect- the government of the
United States to omit any word or
act necessary to the performance of
its, sacred duty of maintaining the
rights of the United States and its
citizens and of safeguarding their
free exercise and enjoyment." '
On May 28, 1915, Germany replied
with a note which covered .a wide
range of argument. - It alleged that
the Lusitania - had masked guns
aboard; that she in., effect was a
