MADE RICH
GOLD STRIKE
ProspectcrSp^lIncovered Rich
Ledge East of Kooskia and
May Have Found "Mother
Lode."
Kooskia, April 27. — (Special to
the Tribune.)—What may prove
to be one the richest strikes ever
made in the mineral belts of the
northwest has been uncovered
and speedily "recovered" by the
discoverers, Smith and Ricketts,
on the Middle Fork of the Clear
water about 15 miles above
Kooskia.
It has been a well-established
fact that a gold-bearing lead ex
tends from Elk City mining dis
trict via Pierce City to the head
waters of the North Fork, a dis
tance of about 100 miles; in fact,
many believe that the gold belt
of the Coeur d'Alene country on
Pritchard creek, near Murray, is
a continuation of the same lode.
About a week ago W. E. Smith
and Tom Ricketts, who "just
happened" to be prospecting to
gether on a certain day, are re
ported to have uncovered a ledge
of the richest gold bearing quartz
ever seen in this section. The
representative of the Tribune
was permitted to see a small
chipping of this bluish quartz,
and the gold was plainly visible
to the naked eye, while under
the glass the entire lump ap
peared to be fairly honey-combed
with .nuggets of pure gold. It is
free-milling, and what it would
yield in gold to the ton would
only be a , guess—but $1,000 per
ton would undoubtedly be a con
servative estimate.
The discovers of the lode were
exceedingly reticent concerning
the exact location of the ledge,
and it is believed by many that
it is on deeded land. The men
are now somewhere in that sec
tion, and are said to be looking
for an extension cf the ledge on
government or unpatented land.
In most placer diggings the
gold is flat or smooth, showing
that it had been worn from its
journey of rather long distances;
while the placer gold found in
the Maggie creek diggings, in
the vicinity of the latest "find,"
is coarse, rough gold, showing
none of the effects of abrasion.
Should this discovery prove to
be the "mother lode" for which
search has been carried on since
the early '60's, it will mean much
for the Middle Fork country and
to Kooskia, the nearest railroad
point.
Was Very Pleasant Affair
More than a hundred persons
attended the celebration at the
Odd Fellow hall Saturday eve
ning of the 97th anniversary of
the organization of the order in
this country. Members of both
the Odd Fellow and Rebekah
lodges were present as well as
many friends who belonged to
neither order. A nice program
was rendered, after which a fine
banquet was enjoyed, and the
balance of the evening was spent
in dancing and general jollifica
tion. The celebration was pro
nounced by those present as being
one of the most enjoyable occa
sions of the year. Following is
the program rendered:
1. Opening Ode.
2. Piano solo Anna Peterson.
3. Reading, Miss Irma Harri
son, of Reubens.
4. History of local Rebekah

It may be of interest to those
who subscribed to the manual
training and domestic science
fund, to know that this money
was to be divided between the
two departments and the amount
thus derived by the domestic
science department was to go
toward buying a range. How
ever the amount collected was
but $43.50 and a half of that did
not go very far toward buying a
range. That and half the man
ual training department received
is being used to help keep up the
two departments.
Pupils neither tardy or absent
during eighth month.

LOCALS WON
FIRST GAME
■ i
Took Easy Victory Sunday
From Greencreek—Chances
are Good for Winning Team
Again This Season.
The base ball game played here
Sunday between the local and
Greencreek teams resulted in a
sweeping victory for the home
guard by the score of 16 to 4.
Barney Seubert did the box work
for the locals and covered him
self with glory, his offerings being
ably handled by Jack Rooke, who
has all the ear marks of a coming
big league catcher. Felix Funke,
who came up from Lewiston the
night before, handled the third
cushion position in mid-season
form, while Fred Lange ambled
around the infield like a frisky
colt in new pasture. George
Lange, Ben Bieren, George Seu
bert, young Huffman and Gus
Maugg showed up in good shape
for the first game of the season
and give promise of being able to
do their full part in winning
games as the season progresses.
The visiting team was sadly
lacking behind the bat and
showed considerable lack of prac
tice in other positions, or the
score might have been materially
closer. However, the boys have
material enough for a good team
if they succeed in whipping it in
to shape and should win their
share ol games during the sum
mer.
The game Sunday enjoyed a
fair attendance and an effort is
now being made to raise suffi
cient funds to purchase a new
outfit and to organize a team to
represent the town on the dia
mond during the present season.
Several requests for games have
already been received and if the
team meets with proper support
games will be played here almost
every Sunday for the next month
or so.
Trades Store For Big Farm
Hans Pedersen, the well known
Keuterville merchant, completed
a deal Monday whereby he traded
his store property at Keuterville
for a 620 acre ranch on the Col
umbia river near Bridgeport,
Wash., the consideration of the
deal being $17,000. The trade
was made with C. J. Kinder,
county auditor of Douglas county,
and the store at Keuterville will
be in charge of a brother of the
latter, the firm to be known as
the Kinder Mercantile Co. Felix
Funke has been plaeed in charge
of the store until Mr. Kinder can
arrive and is now taking an in
ventory of the stock. The Keu
terville property consists of the
stock of merchandise, store build
ing and warehouse, and about
$2,000 worth of wood and posts.
The ranch Mr. Pedersen se
cured in the trade contains 280
acres of land under cultivation,
most of which can be placed un
der irrigation, and he is well
pleased with his deal. He con
templates moving with his fam
ily to his new home early in
June.
Mrs. Poyneer, a sister of E. T.
Stolz of Greencreek, arrived in
the city late last week from
Pomeroy, Wash., and has ac
cepted a position with the
Cottonwood Mercantile Co.
C. W. Thompson, proprietor of
the local garâge, reports the

P. R. Rush, of Denver, model 75.
Tacke-Baune Wedding
The marriage of Miss Lizzie
Tacke and John Baune was sol
emnized Tuesday morning at the
local Catholic church, Rev. Fath
er Willibrord officiating. The
bride was supported by Miss
Frances Baune, sister of the
groom, and Bernard Tacke acted
in the capacity of best man.
After the ceremony the wedding
party repaired to the home of
the bride's father just south of
town where a bounteous wedding
dinner was partaken of and the
day spent in the usual wedding
festivities. Many invited guests
were gathered there to do honor
to the occasion and numerous
valuable presents were received
by the happy couple. At night a
big, free wedding dance was giv
en by the groom in the K. C.
hall, which was largely attended
by young folks from all parts of
the surrounding country.
The bride is the charming
daughter of Barney Tacke and
has grown to womanhood in this
vicinity. She is a young lady of
many fine qualities and attain
ments and is a prize well worth
the winning.
The groom is the youngest son
of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Baune
and is a young man of known
quality and in every way worthy
of the lady of his choice.
The happy couple will reside
on the groom's farm south of
town and the Chronicle joins
with their many friends in -wish
ing them a long and very happy
wedded life.
Tennis Ciub Getting Active
The local tennis club held an
other meeting the first of the
week and adopted a constitution
and by-laws and drafted rules
and regulations for playing.
Four new members were admit
ted, they being Misses Minnie
Lange, Mamie Burgund and
Edith Humphrey and Clem Huss
man. The club now has about
25 members, all of whom are
taking an active interest this
year, and in a short time two
courts will be in shape for games
at the grounds back of the
Creelman block. The member
ship fee has been placed at $3.00
and monthly dues of 50 cents
are charged for a playing season
of six months. It is probable
that games with teams from
neighboring towns will be ar
ranged during the summer
months, which will increase in
crease interest in the club mate
rially.
Buy Dairy Cows For Farmers
A fine herd of Holstein cows,
purchased from leading dairy
men of the North Yakima sec
tion, was received last week at
Coeur d'Alene City for distri
bution among the farmers of that
section. The cattle were pur
chased by the banks of Coeur d
'Alene through the influence of
the Chamber of Commerce in or
der to assist the dairy industry
in that part of the state and es
pecially to help the farmers and
the new creamery which opened
there Monday. Such moves in
many sections of the west as
the above are being taken up and
in this way many persons who
otherwise would not be in posi
tion to engage in the industry
are sold cows on the easy pay
ment plan and at once become
patrons of the creameries and
loyal supporters of the dairy
industry.
It is more than probable that a
plan of this nature can be evolved
here in Cottonwood if the pro
gjosed creamery succeeds in or
ganizing.
