BOYS AGAIN
Frankfort Dispatches to Lou
isville Press Says Proba
bility is Third Ken
tucky Regiment
Will Camp
Here
i
There is every indication that the
Third Kentucky Regiment will camp
at Earlington this year, says a Frank
fort Dispatch to the Louisville Press.
There is no doubt about the matter,
Earlington is the logical point for
this encampment, as the state rifle
range is located here, and there is an
abundance of fine pura, water. There
are also excellent railroad facilities
and an abundance of land for camp
ing purposes. The encampment
held here a few years ago was said to
have been one of the most profitab'e
ever held in the1 State and there is
absolutely no reason why this en
campment should not be duplicated
this year. '

AN ENJOYABLE AFFAIR
The choir of the M. E. Church,
gave their leader, Oscar East, a de
lightful surprise Tuesday night the
occasion being his 27th birthday.
After an unusually interesting choir
practice at the church he was "con
ducted to the parsonage where he was
taken in charge by the male members
and put under the bed in celebration
of the eyent. When he emerged he
was conducted to the dining room
where the gorgeous birthday cake
lighted by twenty seven candles had
been placed upon the table. The
cake had a ribbon for each guest issu
ing from the center and each guest
had to cut a slice. Ask some who
were present what all was hidden,
therein."
After the burst of merriment caus
ed by the general slicing and its re
sults had somewhat subsided, delic
ious refreshments" consisting of lemon
ice, cake and homemade candy were
served by the hostess, Mrs? Burton
and others
Then Mr. East was ushered into
the parlor where he was presented
with several nice gifts from the choir
in grateful acknowledgement of their
appreciation of his faithful services
as director of the choir.
'1 he remainder of the evening was
spent in pleasont conversation and
singing.
Those present were: Mesdames
Wm. Larmouth, Forrest Groves, Jim
Austin, Carl Vickers, George Mrs
Armstrong, Eliza Larmouth and J. L.
Burton; Misses Lelia and Ethel East,
Annie Clark Fay, and Fairy Bur
ton; Messrs Wm. Larmouth, Earl
East, Forrest Groves, Noble Clark
and Oscar East.
At a late hour the guests took
their departure, all wishing Oscar
many happy returns 0 the days. As
the whole affiair was such a delight
ful surprise to him it is needless to
add he wouldn't object if birthdays
came quite often.
