A CYCLONE-PROOF WINDMILL
On March 21 there occurred a very
sever storm over most or umo,
Michigan and Indiana. In Ohio it
was largely rain, In Michigan snow,
but around Van Buren, Ind., there
occurred a regular cyclone. Trees
were broken off, fences torn down
barns demolished, roofs of houses
damaged," small buildings upturned
and the wreckage was very serious.
A Clover Leaf train was even blown
rom the track during the storm
Rigtot in the path of the storm were
located some half-dozen or more wind
mills. One of these was a Monarch
made by the Celina Manufacturing
Company, Celina, O. Surrounding
it, on adjoining farms, were five oth
er mills, all of which were blown
down, the Monarch not being damag
ed at all. As a result of this unus
ual illustration of the Monarch's
strength, a large number of orders
for new wind mills have come to The
company. Farm Implement News.
J. E. Raudabaugh, North Walnut
street, has sold his interest in the
Celina Hardwood Manufacturing
company to J. J. Vorp and G. F.
Wood. Mr. Raudabnugh was one of
he organizers of the Celina Hard

conducted for many years a saw mill.
He expects to devote his time now to
farming.

who has been in the Oklahoma oil
fields the past few months, returned
home the first of the week. He says
it takes a millionaire to get in on the
ground floor out there since oil has
gone skyward, and the big interests
dominate everything. One of the
things you can't get out there is a
good drink of water for love or mon
ey, and he says that he would not
live there for a considerable amount
of "filthy lucre."

ANDERSON
Endeavorers Awarded Banner at
Great Bally of Societies
In This City.
The Mercer County Christian Kn
leavor Rally wus called to order and
opened by the president, Rev. Suave
ly. Devotion was then conducted by
liev. Lance, of the M. E. church, "of
Celina. The minuates of the C. E.
convention of this county, which was
held In the Church of Christ at Mon
tezuma, October, 1915, were read
and approved.
The Stale Vice president, Rev,
Speer, of Toledo, gave a very Inter
esting talk, the theme of which was:
One must come in personal contact
with people of the outside world in
order to lead them to Christ. He
compared the workers of the C. E.
with the parable of the leaven and
the meal, lie also spoke of The won
derful woik of the Juniors and told
them of the possibilities of them
bringing other juniors and even older
people to the C. E. and finally to the
Kingdom of Heaven.
The president then turned the
meeting over to hte Celina Juniors,
and they under tha leadership of the
Misses Rutherford and Quinby, ren
dered such a splendid entertainment
that all of the seniors were surprised
ot their ability.
Miss Smith, State Junior Supt
then gave an excellent talk to the
Juniors. The grown people as wel
as the little ones were well pleasei
when she suggested building a C. E
auto. The various parts of the much
ine were given as representing the
ollicers of the Endeavor societies
By the time that all of the ollicers
were named, the auto was quite com
plete. Miss Smith then told to the
little folks the story of Mollie and
her black ats. This was interesting
and helpful and presented the value
of a willing self denial. The atlk
was closed by a prayer to God. Rev
Snavely urged the Endeavorers to
organize Junior Societies. The little
people then voted to have a Junior
Endeavor Rally and picnic sometime
this summer. Miss Smith will ar
range to be with them.
The new efficiency chart was next
explained by Miss Smith. The p.m.
services were dismissed with the C
E. benediction.,
The evening session of the rally
was opened with a fine selection ren
dered by the Montezuma orchestra.
Devotion was then led by the County
vice president, Wiliam Preston, of
Montezuma. Rev. Shafer of the Ce
iina Presbyterian church gave a sin
cere and good welcome to the visit
ing societies.
The societies then responded to the
roll call and the banner was given
to the Anderson society, for it had
the highest per cent of members at
the rally.
Miss Smith again addressed the
people. On request she talked on J.
C. E. in the rural church and says
that we can all have a junior society
if we want It sulliciently bad. And
the only requirements are prayer and
sacrifice. She gives the names of
Moses; Samuel and Jesus as work
ers and says that their work was
brought about by dedication, train
ing and service.
Historical examples were also put
forth. The crusades of Richard the
Lion Hearted, and the Triumphant
Entry into Jerusalem. The third is
the great hand of the Junior Endeav
orers. Children are naturally relig
ious. Proof was gotten from Gene
sis. The seed of piety, virtue anu
faith are emplanted In the heart and
will grow if cultivated, but like a
tender plant, if trampled on, or if it
is not taken care of, it will naturally
die. They need not only an educa
tion but a chance to discuss topics
and develop. God gave us his only
sou, may we not give to Him our
life, our work and our best.
Rev. Speer then read a passage
of scripture from the apostle Paul.
He then proceeded to fehow the work,
ideas and life of this writer. He
said 'Man does not die but the spirit
returns to the one who gave it." So
we should live and work for Christ.
What is it to know Christ? It Is
more than to nave a nodding ac
quaintance with him. It is wrong to
say that you know Christ when you
only have been baptized. The church
is a necessity or Christ wouldn't have
given it to us. He that loveth know-
eth God. for God is love. He is too
great to be known intellectually, so
we must know him through love. Mr.
Speer quotes from the Bible and says
"The natural man kuoweth not God,
neither can he, for He is spiritually
discerned." He also says, "Without
the sense of beauty, we can not have
a knowledge of the beautiful. Neith
er can you know Christ without
Spirituality."
Rev. Bouse offered the benedic
tion.
Tho strangers and all out of town
people were very pleasantly enter
tained at supper at the home of Rev.
Shafer, by the Presbyterian Society.
E. W. Lockhart, of Rockford, made
The Democrat a pleasant call while
In town, Tuesday leaving one of the
old Bryan dollars to put his subscrip
tion to 1917.
