DISBARMENT PROCEEDINGS
DISKED
SEVERAL WITNESSE
Makers of Affidavits Swear They Did
Not Know What the Affidavit Con
tained When They Signed It
JUDGE O'CONNOR PRESIDED
Suit Was Brought In Name of State
of Arizona But Was Prosecuted By
O. T. Richey of Phoenix.
In the Superior Court on Monday
last, Judge O'Connor, of Santa Cruz
County, presiding, the disbarment pro
ceedings against E. E. Wall, for al
leged unprofessional conduct as an at-torney-at-law,
prior to the time he was
elected to be County Attorney, came
on for a hearing. Under our Statu
tes the title of the case was State of
Arizona vs . E . E . Wall, but upon re
quest of Mr. Harben, Assistant Attor
ney General of the State, who was
present, the names of O. T. Richey
and Benton Dick were entered as at
torneys for the plaintiff. The prosecu
tion was presented by Mr . Richey and
Mr. Harben, representing the State,
took no part in the proceedings. At
the conclusion of the examination of
witnesses the Court ordered the dis
barment proceedings dismissed for
lack of testimony to substantiate the
allegations of the complaint and fur
ther stated, that in his opinion, the
proceedings should never have been
Instituted .
During the course of the trial it was
demonstrated that Everett Hagan had
been active in securing the affidavits
upon which the complaint had been
brought and it is reported that he em
ployed Attorney Richey to prosecute
Wall.
The court room was , well filled
with spectators during the course of
the hearing, a number of women also
being prneset in the audience. Not
ing their presence in the court room
the Judge stated that inasmuch as
there was no jury in the case they
might occupy seats in the jury box,
which Invitation was accepted by
twelve members of the fair sex. After
the ladies had taken seats in the jury
box the court remraked: "That is
what the jury box will look like when
we get to trying cases before the
ladies."
After the preliminaries of reading
the complaint and answer in the case
had been concluded, the first witness
on behalf of the State, was Mrs. C.
W. Bailey, (colored) who resides at
Morenci and who testified that she
engaged E. E. Wall to bring divorce
proceedings for her in December, 1913.
Q. Was there any agreement come
to between you and him as to whether
, or not he would act as your attorney?
A. Yes, sir. He said he would take
the case for $36.80.
Q. What was that $36.80 to pay
for? A. It was to pay for my divorce
Q. Do you know what items that
was to cover, or whether that was
the amount 'he fixed andy ou paid him?
A. He said he didn't know how much
it would cost for the mileage from
Tombstone to Huachuca.
Q. That was to be additional? A.
Tes, sir.
Q. Do you know whether or not he
filed that divorce action for you? A.
Well, I didn't know until I engaged a
lawyer to see
Q. Of your own knowledge? A. Not
of my own knowledge.
Q. Did he ever repay ypu any of
that money? A. Yes, sir; in Febru
ary, 1916, I told him my husband was
dead; that I' was notified from the
American Consul in Cananea, Mexico
that he was dead and died of typhus
fever; I told him. He brought a paper
to Morenci saying it was $10.00 paid
the court; it was marked over with a
pen or pencil $5.00 over it, which
made it $15.00 that was paid.
Q. That is, $15.00 paid to the
court? A. Yes, sir; it was written
with a typewriter and $5.00 marked
over with a pencil or a pen, I don't
know which; I thought it was just luck
that I got that back.
Q. How much did he pay you
back? A. $21.80.
Q. In other words, he took out $15
and paid you $21.80?
A. Yes, sir.
Mr. Richey: Q. Calling the atten-
nt ha ii-itiioea t r T7!vhihit i'1 at.
tached to the original complaint filed
in this Court, purporting to be the affi
davit of Mrs. C. W. Bailey did you
ever see that before that paper (hand
ing paper to witness?) A. Yes, sir.
Q. Is that (indicating) your signa
ture? A. Yes, sir.
Q. That is your affidavit? A.
Yes, sir.
The Court: I notice from your
affidavit here that it was subscribed
and sworn to on the 19th day of May,
1915? A. Yes, sir.
Q. And you say that in the year
1913 this divorce was to be procured
for you here in this court? A. Yes,

: Mr. Worsley: Q. Well, if you

him with; it takes nearly every cent
I can make to take care of two child
ren. Q. Well, you didn't try to see him?
A. Well, If I had had the money I
would.
; J. But you figured that filing this
affidavit to disbar him would help get
your money back? A. I don't know.
' Here followed testimony to show
that Hagan brought the affidavit to
the witness and secured her signature
although the witness admitted that
she signed it willingly.
Mr. Worsley: Q. Then, Mr.
Wall paid you all the money back
except me $13. uu court costs; A..

was marked over with a lead pencil
or pen I don't know which $15.00.

Court? A. I had a lawyer look it
up for me and he said it was only
$10.00 and that was to go to the court
, Q. Who did you have look this
up? A. Mr. Horton.

him up .

complaint didn't you tell him all about
the case? A. Yes, sir.
Q. Didn't you talk to Mr. Wall
and take up his time telling him all

didn't do anything at all.
Q. You didn't take up any of his
time telling him about your husband;

about it in his office? A. I couldn't
exactly tell; I know I have been down

Upon his return he was stopped by
