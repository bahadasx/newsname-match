ACT OF
1899 IS UPHELD
SUPREME COURT
Decision of Lower Court Affirmed in
Cathcart-Manitoba Red Lake
Railway Case.
LANDS NOT SUJECT TO
HOMESTEAD ENTRY
Lands Were Appropriated for Ex-
pressed Trust, Says Court
Decision.
The Nelson Act of 1899, ceding
lands within the Red Lake Indian
reservation to the United States, was
upheld by the Minnesota supreme
court today.
Not Subject to Entry.
"Although the Indian title was ex
tinguished by the act, the lands were
not ceded absolutely," said the court.
"They were appropriated for the pur
pose of an expressed trust and were
to be disposed of in the manner des
ignated to carry out the purposes of
that trust. They were accordingly
not subject to entry under the home
stead laws of the United States."
Cathcart Brings Case.
The case was brought into the su
preme court on the appeal of Thomas
Cathcart of Beltrami county who had
settled on some of the land in 1903.
Previous to that time congress had
granted the Minnesota & Manitoba
railroad lands within the reservation
for its right of way. Part of this
right of way extended through the
land claimed by Cathcart.
He brought action against the
Canadian Northern railroad which
succeed the Minnesota & Manitoba
railroad to prevent it from going
through his land.
The district court here held that
Cathcart had no right to the land un
der the Nelson act.
Cathcart appealed but the supreme
court affirmed the judgment.

an effort to secure a proper scale of
timber sold from state land. The
state forester has in his employ thir
teen district rangers and thirty-five
patrolmen and these men will super

the securing of estimates of the
stumps for proof as to whether a
proper scale of the timber cut has
been made. The employment of the
men in this capacity will not involve
any additional expense to the state.

drama "Fear," which comes to the

wrong doing leaves a tell tale mark

its own punishment. This is one of
the most remarkable photoplays ever

"I have examined with the secre

of Mexico.
"The report includes a tentative
agreement covering the future op
erations of both the American and
Mexican military forces and evidences
cordial co-operation between the two
governments in their common pur
pose.
"As this agreement is being sub
mitted to the de facto government in
Mexico, it would not be proper for
me to permit its publication until
that government has an opportunity
to examine and consider its provi
sions. The full text of the proposed
agreement will be given out imme

governments. In general I may

not guilty and after hearing what the
government had to offer he changed
his mind and entered a plea of
guilty.
Cook was the owner of the steam

It is claimed that he carried a quan
tity of liquor on the steamer and sold
it to Indians and the white men. The
steamer was confiscated by the gov
ernment.

told the Federal officers to go back
to Red Lake and to tell the people
there that the next one found guilty

tenced to not less than a year in the
penitentiary and may be sentenced
