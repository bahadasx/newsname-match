Tho question wna: Resolvod, that tho
United States should ask tho A B C
iiowora to join her in defining nnd on
forcing tho Monroe Doctrine. Vermont
upholil the nllirmntivo while Middlebury
took tho negntive. Tho spenkcra for
Vermont in order were: T. H. Iahnm,
10, L. A. Woodward, 18 nnd P. R
Johnson, '1G, while those for Middle
bury were W. H. Edmunda, '17, J. J.
Floyd.'lG nnd R. H. BufTum, '18. Ench
wna given tcn minutea for the firat
apeech, nfter which thcro wna nn inter
mission with music by the college or
chcatra, nnd then ench apoaker hud five
minutea for n robuttal. The nffirmntive
took for their nointa to prove threo-
flrat thnt we should maintain tho Mon
roe Doctrine, second thnt the A B C
powers could holp us, nnd thinl that we
should nsk them to do so. They nr
gued thnt both tho A B C powers nnd
the United States were in dunger nnd
thnt nn nliance would be protective,
that the alianco would dispel diatrust of
countriea concerned, nnd thnt tho nlli-
nnco would l e one atep ahend in the
world peaco movement. Mr. Edmunda
of the negative ahowed six waya of ac-
complishing the same resulta sought
for by the nllianco without entering the
allianco, thus escaping the dangiirs
which he proved would be imminent
should the proposition be carried. Mr.
Floyd of the negative entirely convinced
tho audience by his enthusiasm, logic,
nnd clenrnesa of thought, thnt the nlli
ance would hi dangeroua, thnt the
movement would not aid world peace,
but that the war in B'urope waa a direct
outgrowth oi such an alliance and that
the A B C powers were totally unfit to
act in such capacity owing to their jeal
ous nature. Mr. Buffum showed clearly
that the A B C pjwera would be no
matorinl aid in cnse the United States
was at war with some other nnticn,
owing to the fnct that they were unable
even to protect their own coast, that if
the alliance were entered into nnd one
of the A B C powers were to rnter into
war, no matter what the cause, the
United Statea would be compelled to
enter also, thnt the nlliance would be a
defensive one, and then his final maater
ful stroke, thnt if the United States
should enter the alliance she would be
signing her name to an undefined treaty,
putting her own head in a noose, by the
very question itself, as the Doctrine
was to be defined after the allinnce was
entered, and it might be defined in any
way the A B C powers should chooae,
owing to the fnct that thoy would out-
vote the United Statea by three votea
to one in the alliance.
After the rebuttals, several of which
were warmly delivered, the written de
cisions of the judges were collected,
during which time Dr. Thomna spoke
of the merita of inter-collegiate debntes
and the good to be gained from them.
On opening the decisions it was found
that they were unanimously in favor of
the negative, giving Middlebury the
decision, 3-0.
