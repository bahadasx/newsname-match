CHURCH UNION
18 ADVOCATED
IJY EPISCOPAL IJOARI) IN CON
FERENCE AT SAHATOGA
SPRINGS, N. Y.
CHEERED DECLARATIONS
Bishops' Report Shows Church Mem
bership Has Increased nt n Very
Rapid Rate.
Saratbga Springs, May 3. Recom
mendations of the board of bishops
of tho Methodist Episcopal church
for a organized union with tho Meth
odist Episcopal Church, South, arous
ed great enthusiasm yesterday among
the delegates at the general confer
ence. Bishop Berry of Philadelphia,
said the demonstration was most sig
nificant. Each declaration of a un
ion met with prolonged cheers.
The membership of the Methodist
Episcopal denomination has increas
ed between 300,000 and 400,000
every four years for more than a ha'f
a century, according to tho Episcopal
address of the Board of Bishops read
at today's session of the Methodist
general conference by Bishop John
W. Hamilton of Boston.
Tho Episcopal address which is thq
formal utterance ot the Bishops of
the church reviewed the work of tho
denomination since tho Minneapolis
conference of 1912 and made recom
mendations concerning futuro labors.
It Is emphasized the responsibility
and opportunity resulting from the
European war saying:
"Tho occasion requires the keenest
discernment and most tolerant ap
preciation of the opinions and feel
ings in the several belligerent na
tions. This especially true of Meth
odists, who by their systems, ot
church policy aro related to every na
tion nt war. In Petrograd, Rome,
Frankfort, Franco and Hungary tho
work of the church is being planned
and carried on with a forward look."
Limits the Bishops.
The plan adopted four years ago of
trying out the resldental supervision
on the part of the Bishops whereby
each Bishop has charge of tho annual
conferences contiguous to his epis
copal residence, has been satisfactory
to the bishops, but they feel that It is
undersirabla to group several such
Episcopal ereas. "It tends," the ad
dress sets fourth -"to limit the ex
perience and knowledge of tho bish
ops to restricted sections, to prevent
a wise and proper use of tho transfer
system (for ministers), to hlnderthclr
(the bishop's) most perfect service
to thoso parts ot the church which
are missionary in character, and
their largest uso of the church boards
whoso operations cover tho entiro
country."
Tho proposal to' reunite tho Meth
odist Episcopal church and tho Meth
odist Episcopal church South which
divided about 70 years ago, over tho
question of slavery, is approved In
the address. Tho attltudo ot the bish
ops on this question follows:
''We? are convinced of tho essential
unity ot tho two great Methodlsms In
doctorlno and life, and this essential
union must In duo season express It
self In outward and organic from.
Without presuming to pronounce up
on tho terms of union wo dcclaro our
selves earnestly in favor of tho or
ganic union ot tho Methodist Episcop
al church and tho Methodist Episcop
al church South, and of such other
bodies as may share our common-
Moreover wo
inun aim experience,
declnro ourselves In favor of such a
union upon terms that shall provldo
an ample and brotherly protection for
any minority."
Tho bishops praised tho denomina
tional activities among the negroes
of tho south, tile labors of tho mis-
sion boards and tho study and crltl-'
Hum nf tho scrlntures under the di-
rection. ot the laymen's missionary
society. Child labor, tho growth ot
Mormonlsm, tho repeal of Sabbath
observanco laws in several 'localities
and the liquor traffic were denounced
in tho address.
All children are Invited to bo at
our storo on Tuesday between 3 and
5 in the afternoon. We have a I
pleasant surprise for them. Watch

KNOCKOUT GIVEN
PHILIPPINE BILL
LOWER
HOUSE- DEFEAT MEAS
URE 11Y 213 TO 105
VOTE.
FIRST MINORITY VICTORY
Over Plan Urged by Wilson Giving
Independence, to Is
lands. Washington, May 1. The Ad
ministration's fight for the Senate
Philippine bill with Its Clark amend
ment authorizing independence
for the Islands within four years was
lost to-night in the House. After
voting 213 to 105 'to strlko out the
Clarke amendment, tho House by a
rote of 251 to 17 passed as a sub
etituto for tho entiro measure of self
government In the Philippines and
catrylng a preamble declaring tho in
tention of the United States to grant
independence ultimately but-wlthout
fixing a date.
Now the bill goes to conference be
tween the two houses, with tho op
ponents of the Clarke amendemtn
satisfied1 that it is dead at least for
this session of Congress.
The House remained in session un
til late tonight to take the final vote.
ThlrtyJ democrats Joined the solid Re
publican minority in defeating the
Clarke amendment which had been
given unqualified indorsement by
President Wilson. It was the first
marked victory of the year over any
part of the President's legislative pro
gram and the Republicans were nois
ily jubilant over it. After each vic
torious vote they applauded for sev
eral minutes and by way of mocking
tho Democrats emitted repeatedly the
famous "rebel" yell of tho majority.
Democrats accepted their dpfeat in
silence1.
Tho first vote taken after eight
hours debato In committee of the
whole showed 193 to 151 votes again
tho Senate provision. Chairman
Jones, of tho Insular Affairs Com
mittee, then attempted to procure the
adoption of substitutes extending the
time limit for freeing the Filipinos.
They were quickly voted down. The
first, to grant freedom In not less
than two or not more than six years,
was defeated 186 to 14G, and the sec
ond, making the minimum time four
years and the maximum eight waB
lost 193 to 1C2.
Then came the substitution of tho
Jones bill. The entire House Insular
Commltteo had agreed to it before
tho Senate bill had passed, and sub
stancially the same measure was pass
ed bythe House at the last session of
Congress. Without further debate
on other sections of the Senate bill,
Mr. Jones offered his measure as a
substituto for tho remainder of the
Senate bill and it Immediately was
adopted.
There is nothing in the body of tho
Jones bill promising independence to
tho Filipinos nor anything' in any
part of it setting a definite timo for a
declaration ot their independence.
Tho preamblo merely states that it
always has been tho intention ot tho
United States Government to give tho
islands their freedom and In order
that they may bo better prepared for
It a larger degree of control over
their domestic atfalrs Is placed in
their hands.
Manuel L. Quezon tho resident
Commissioner of tho Philippines, in
Congress, said ho was so greatly dls-
appointed over tho failure of the Sen-
ato bill In tho House that he would
not return to Congress.
"This ends my work in Cong
ress," ho said, "I am not coming
back. What Is tho use? The action
of the Houso tonight makes the fight
r independence harded. I notlco
'hat nt sll,8,e Uepubllcan yoted
for tho Clarko amendment. They
ha'l ll n "Bured out in advance."
Mr. Quezon had advocated the Sen
ate bill in an earnest speech during
tho afternoon, He told the House
that Japan would not seize tho is
lands if they wero freed, nnd more
over that Japan would keep off any
European nation that might turn
hungry eyes that way.
"Japan is not going to antagonize
the European nations and the United
States," he said. "Japan knows that
the Philippine people ne,ver would be
happy under the Japanes6 flag, and
that it would mean that Japan would
havo war with somo other nation."
"Have you confidence in the world
nations to believe that you will be let
alono nfter you are free and Indepen
dent without a standing army and
navy?" demanded Representative
O'Shaughncssy.
"I havo no more confidence in the
world nations than the small nation
of tho American people In 177G when
there wero only 3,000,000 of them,"
replied Mr. Quezon.
He said he was satisfied, however.
thnt tlin lllll WrtlllH trr yor tn t..i'
Senate, go into conference, there to
die.
"If Abraham Lincoln were here to
day," ho added, "ho would bo be
wildered. He would have to bo in
troduced to you on the Republican
side."
Over tho heated protest of Admin
istration leaders the House, by a vote
of 203 to 154, instructed its conferees
not to agree to any declaration set
ting a definite time for granting tho
islands independence.
SUES FOR FAILURETO
DELIVER TOBACCO CROP
Paducah, Ky., May 3. The second
suit of .its kind has been filed in Cir
cuit Court by the DIckerson Tobacco
Company against W. A. Miller for
$120 damages for failure to execute
a contract to deliver his crop of to
bacco. The plaintiff alleged it con

pounds, to bo delivered prior to June

that tho men fled.
Detectlvo Chief Malcolm Brown
and Capt. Egan, of Lexington, who
wore nearby, gave pursuit as Black

ROOSEVELT DECLARES THIS IS

OF AMERICA.
HONOR MUST BE UPHELD
Urges Republicans to Select Man Who
Can Put Honor of U. S. Abovo
Partisan Considerations.
New York, May 1. Col. Theodore
Roosevelt, on his return here tonight
from Chicago, Issued a statement ex
pressing gratification with tho recep
tlon of his views on "preparedness,
national duty and Americanism" la
the Mlddlo West. Col. Roosevelt de
clared ho Is not Interested In the po
litical fortunes of himself or others,
and, after outlining the principles ad
vocated In recent speeches, said:
"It can not be said too often that
this Is a time of crisis In the Nation's
career. We are now laying the foun
dation and the controlling lines of a
now era In our history. Everything
I can do will be done to sue that the
people, West and East, realize the
facts and act accordingly.
"By no act of mine, by no word of
mine has this grave question been la'
volved In factional politics. In every
State in which the law governs such
matters I have promptly withdrawn
my name from all factional struggles'.
In a cable message from Trinidad on
March 9 last, I requested and Insist--ed
that my friends In Massachusetts
refrain from such a contest, and I
would have invoked the law there as
I
did In other States it there had been
such a law. In t)iat -statement I also
said that I was not interested in tho
political fortunes either of myself or
others, and I have resolutely stuck to'
that determination. I have not ex
pressed and" do'tfofintend to Express
myself as being for or against any
man.
,JAs regards myself, I do not be
lieve that the delegates ought to nom
inate me at Chicago unless they are
prepared whole-heartedly and with
out reserve to make the fight along
the lines above outlined. I am fight
ing for certain principles. Those who
take their stand in such a matter be
cause of factional or personal pre
judice are either lacking In patriot
ism or else are blind to the tremen
dous forces at work tho world over.
In the midst of a tragedy without
parallel in the world's vision, the
work to be done Is not that of the
politician, but of the patriot.
"For that reason I most earnestly
hope that the delegates who go to
Chicago will nominate some man on
whom Republicans and Progressives
can combine, and who, moreover, can
be heartily supported by all inde
pendent citizens, and particularly by
all Independent Democrats who are
loyal to tho nationalism of Andrew
Jackson and who aro prepared to put
the vital honor and Interest ot this
nation above all mere partisan con
siderations. I hope they will choose
a man upon whom all can unite and
who, If elected, wo can be absolutely
certain will put the principles above
set forth Into actual effect In tho gov
ernment of the country.".
