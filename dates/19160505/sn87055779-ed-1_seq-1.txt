Germany declares that unless
the United states compels KriK

new situation will arise in which
the (krman Kovtrnment "must

The German v,oernment wants

tion cf the (ierman reply to the
.American sul)marine ultimatum,
made public in Berlin this morning.
Officialdom was widely divided as to
the effect of the note. The text, it
was admitted, was open to two inter
pretations ither that it lid, or it
did not meet the itws of the presi
dent. Those who argued that it did
pointed out that the only part of
the rejoinder which showed tletinite
action, set forth that Germany had
changed the orders given her sub
marine commanders so that now they
specifically are instructed to obey
the requirements of international
law in attacking merchantmen, and
also to save lives except when ves
sels resist or try to escape. Those
taking an opposite view, and they
include many of the administrat ion
leaders, insisted that the concession
is so hinged upon conditions that it
does not meet the views of the
United "States, and that I'res't Wilson
has no alternative under his own
note of April 1 hut to recall Am
bassador Gerard and hand Ambas
sador von lUrnstorff his passports.

The president and his cabinet had
before them today the press ilis
patches containing the note. Wut the
;!easant fiction of not considering
any text hut that ofliclally com
municated by Ambasador Gerard as
the otficial one, ws resorted to in
order to evade any expression of any
Mrt that could be construed as in
dicating the attitude to be taken by
the administration. The Gerard text
is on the way by cable in cod and
i? cannot 'et into Pres't Wilson's
hands, state department otfieh'ls say,
much bfforc tomorrow. It w.s em
phatically asserted at both the white
house and the state departnu-nt that
there will be . no undue haste in
rt.iehing the decision on whether the
rote is satisfactory or not. The pres
ident and ec'y Irnsing will digest
the entirn note before reaching any
conclusion and een the president's
ludest advisers declined to hazard a
Kuess as to what Iiis attitude is like

So far as the i;en-ral to:u of the
reply was concerned, oifuiuls con
ieded its seeming unfriendliness, but
it was pointed out that this was to
be expected owing u the fact that
the German Korrmunt was com

The accusations that this rovern
i ient has favored the allies jnd dis
criminated against Germany has
been expected by otlicials here and
are discounted by the realization
that a good part of this paragraph
is designed for home consumption.
The real crux of the situation was
contained ir. the declaration by th
German government that its orders
to its submarine commanders now
have been changed.. Taken by them
selves, the new orders would abso

For Curtailment of Submarine Warfare
IüteriiJiti'nnl News Si-rvi.p;
HHIILIX, May Z. Germany's re
ply to the note f the United States
which was made public today de
fends Germany's submarine war
fare. Germany docs1 not r-gard the
reply as rinal. In the response the
opportunity is asked to make fur
ther representations to the United
States, particularly in regard to the
Sussex.
The note declares that the German
government has restricted her sub
marine activities to her own di.-ad-
vuntaKa and to the advantage of the
allies, adding:
"No .such consideration has ever
been shown neutrals by Great Hrit
ain and her allies."
The contention of the imperial
German government is that the sub
marine warfare of this nation ha al
ways been conducted with reganl to
the rules of war.
The 'xception has been in the ca.e
of enemy trade or carried on in the
"war zone" waters around the Brit
ish isles, the note states.
However, no assurances were evr
given to the United States in respect
to stuli trade, it was declared by the
foreign ottiee.
The United States is charted with
responsibility for the dangers con
fronting citizens of that country
traveling upon ships flying the flag
of a belligerent nation.

If the United Statt s had accepted

the foreign olhoe.
It is alleged that the United States
has made a series f statements to
G rnianv w hi h have for their gist
the charge that the German admi
ralty has been conducting- its under
water warfare ruthlessly and with
out regard for the laws of war and
humanity. This is denied. It is also

pollowing is the full text of the
German note:
' Tile undersigned, in behalf of the
imperial Germar government, has
the lumor to present to his excel
lency the ambassador of the l'nited

submarine warfare.
"The German government handed
ever to the proper naval auihoriti-s

ernment forthwith observe the in
Urnathmal laws universally recog
nizeil before the war," and with the
threat that if the United States shall
tail to attain the object it desires, the
"(Ierman government would be fac
ing a new situation in which it must
reserve for itself complete liberty of
action," has admittedly complicated
the situation. The men who be.-t
know- Pres't Wilson's mind insisted
today that he will not accept any
such limited acceptance of his
original demand. They say that he
has asserted to all f his advisers
that the United States will not be
any party to bargaining to compel

nized rules, of civilized warfare.

Many of the senate and hiuse
Kaders took the view that the (ier
man reply was sc h a sweeping v ic
t'ry for the United States that the
president should ac -pt it even
though it did not go as far as he de
s.red. But they admitted that they
would be compelled to support the
president if he should rule otherwise
j.r.d should onier a break in diplo
matic relations, in fact, it was ter
t.iin today that no matter winch way
the president interpreted th note he
would be upheld by a big majority in
ooth houses of congress. liven the
men who have advocated peace at
r.ny price admitted today that the
president will have almost unani
i kius support in any action that he
row shall take.
The most hopeful feature of the J
tntire question was the very frank
remission by Germany that she
wants to tonnne the fighting to bel
ligerent nations and does not desire
that the bloodshed shall extend to
