Pan-American Head Urges
Large Army and Navy to En
force Monroe Doctrine.
TALKS PREPAREDNESS TO
WOMEN AT MIIJTARY CAMP
Says U. S. Must Be Ready to Protect
Not Only This Country. But South
and Central America, Too.
An urgent plea for preparedness,
adequate to protect on both land and
sea not only the United States, but
iouth and Central America, was made by
John Barrett, director general of the Pan
American Un!on. in an address at the
National Service School camp yesterday
ifternoon.
"Pan-American preparedness," he said.
"is a matter of immeasurable importance
to the United States. Upon it may de
pend the very existence of every Amer
can nation. Without it, the Monroe
Doctrine may become a 'scrap of paper'
a bundle of meaningless words.
"Unless the United States army and
navy shall be adequate to enforce re
spect for the Monroe Doctrine wherever
:alled upon, it will have no significance
beyond the confines of the United States
Without the actual power of enforcement
Dack of it, it will be neither applicable
)r respected outside of the United States,
"What's the use of the Monroe Doctrine
mnless it means just as much in London,
n Berlin, in Paris, in Madrid. in Petro
,ard. and in Tokyo, as it does in Wash
ngton."
SUver .iatag Ns Clod.
Mr. Barrett asserted that the twenty
me nations of the western hemisphere
re entering upon an extraordinary era
,f New pan-Americanism. He said the
uropean war has done more to produce
his result than any other event since the
1^-laration of the Monroe Doctrine in
'23. and that "the silver lining of the
European war cloud for the Americas is
the Impetus and inspiration which it has
tven to pan-American solidarity, co
,peration, and commerce."
The speaker said that in urging pan
Xmerican preparedness he did not mean
hat every American republic should
equip itself equal to the task of repelling
foreign invasion, for that would he too
:Nat a hirden, but that the Uniteel
tates should be sufficiently prepared to
rotect the republics if they should be
n danger of attack from a European or
\siatic foe.
"While it is the sincere helief of most
tudents of pan-Americanism," he said,
that no European nation, or group of
iations will ever question the Monroe

Paris, May 4.-The new French position
at Le Mort Homme, which resulted from
the gains made in yesterday's attack,
was enlarged and consolidated last night.
Today the Germans bombarded both Le

and also sent out a small infantry at
tack against certain of the trenches taken
by the French in the counter-offensive.
This attack broke down under the French
barrier fire.
The French took the offensive today
in the Argonne in artillery activity in the
Bois de Cheppy, and gained the advantage
in mine fighting at La Flle Morte.
A strong German reconnaissanoe was
repulsed near Apremont, east of St.

WIFE PLEADS
FOR SULLIVAN
Asks State Department tot
Act in Behalf of Former
U. S. Diplomat.
ARRESTED BY BRITISH IN
CONNECTION WITH REVOLT
The wife of James M. Sullivan, former
United States Minister to Santo Domingo,
who has been arrested in connection with
the Dublin rebellion. yesterday appealed
to Secretary Lansing to have the State
Department use its good offices in his
behalf.
Sullivan's arrest presents a new case.
for this is the first time during the pres
ent European war that an American has
been arrested in any of the belligerent
countries charged with treason.
Secretary Lansing stated the depart
ment had not yet acted, but it was in
dicated that the government would do
all it could. It In said that Ambassador
Page will be instructed to look into the
case and make such appeals to the Brit
ish government as may be proper.
Mr. Sullivan, with his wife and son,
left New York last July for a visit to
his mother at his birthplace at Limerick,
Ireland. He sailed shortly after he had
been allowed to resign as Minister to
Santo Domingo following an adverse re
port by a Congressional committee, on
his official conduct there.
Mr. Sullivan first came to notice as
attorney for Jack Rose In the Rosenthal
murder ,case. It was always understood
he was a personal appointee of WIlliam
J. Bryan to the Santo Domingo post.

New York, May 4.-Col. Roosevelt did

It had been rep rted that the colonel
