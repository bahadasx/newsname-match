At Paris Friday
RALPH ROUTON, GROVE BOY,
TAKES DECLAMATION EVENT
Speaking, Athletic Contests and
Big Dinner Enjoyed By
3.000 People
In every particular the school
rally held here last Friday was a
success. '
The weather conditions were
ideal , and one of the largest
crowds that ever attended an
event of this kind in Henry
county was in attendance.
A large number of Huntingdon
people, including students of the
Industrial and Training School,
attended and all went away that
night convinced that Paris'
"heart is in the right place."
While Huntingdon got the best
of the contests winning two out
o three the Grove contestants
tut up good hghts and were
)mo losers. -
In the afternoon I. T. S. took
the ball game by ihe great score
of 24 to 3. However nearly all
of the runs were made on errors,
and when the weight and exper
ience of the visiting boys is taken
into consideration, the Grove
squad played a good game. The
heaviest player on the Grove
nine was hardly as heavy as the
lightest man on the Huntingdon
team.
At the Dixie theatre Friday
night Ralph Routon, represent
ing Grove, won the contest in
declamation, "The Unknown
Speaker" -over Morris Pente
cost, of I. T. S. ,
The debate-"Resolved, That
the President's Policy of Watch
ful Waiting in Regard to the
Mexican Situation is the Proper
Policy for This Government to
Pursue" was won by the affirm
ative debaters, E. L. Robinson
and C. N. Stark, of Huntingdon.
The Grove debaters were John R.
Burton and Frank Upchurch.
The Paris contestants made some
strong arguments and brought
out some strong points, but these
were overcome by the arguments
of the visiting debaters.
A Diano solo by Miss Vennie
Vaden, of Huntingdon, and an
other by Miss Madelyn Lusky,
also of Huntingdon, were very
much enjoyed by the large
audience, which packed the Dixie
theatre to standing room only.
A reading "Just What a Little
Maiden Should Do" -by Miss
Erlyne Dowdy, of I. T. S., was a
real treat
Miss Evelyn Travis, of Grove,

Thought His Feet
Would Fit Limb;
But They Didn't
While gathering blossoms from
the topmost branch of an old
locust tree near his home on
North Brewer Street late Mon
day afternoon, John Fryer, 11,
eldest son of Attorney G. L.
Fryer, of this city, ventured out
a trifle too far on a frail limb
which snapped in two and sent
him crashing head first to the
concrete sidewalk below, shat
tering his left arm between the
elbow and. wrist, and other
wise seriously injuring him.
MEN-BOYS WINNERS
SUNDAY MORNING
At the First Christian Church
Bible School last Sundav the men
and boys won a decisive victory
over the women and girls. The
lead was 245 points. This was
the first Sunday of a contest that
will run for five weeks. The side
winning on three of the five
Sundays will be victorious, re
gardless of the total number of
points made in the contest.
J. J. NELSON BUYS
CITY MEAT MARKET
J. J. Nelson this week pur
chased of C. R. Nelson the City
Meat Market on Podar street,
just north of the Bank of Henry.
Mr. Nelson will continue the
business and will no doubt have
a large patronage as he was for
merly in the same line of busi-1
ness here and has many old cus
tomers who will be glad to again
become patrons of his market.
Everything will he kept in a clean
and sanitary condition.
gave a reading Mammy's
Reminiscences" that was much
appreciated and applauded by
the audience.
A chorus by the Grove girls
and a piano duet by Misses Mar
garet Porter and Vola Rudolph,
of Grove, were also enjoyed.
Prof. J. H. Bayer, of the In
dustrial Training School, pre
sided at the Dixie and introduced
those on the program. At the
beginning of the program, Prof.
Bayer stated that it would be
necessary to get through with
the program as early as possible
in order that the Huntingdon
students might not miss their
train, and illustrated his point
by telling a story of a runaway
couple, who were being chased
by the irate father of the bride.
When they reached the magis
trate they told him that they
were in a hurry to have the knot
tied, and the ever-obliging jus
tice complied. "Have her?"

NEEDS OF SCHOOL TALKED
OF AT THURSDAY'S MEETING
Mass Meeting Will Be Held On
Saturday May 13, At Cir
cuit Court Room
Plans for the erection of a boys
dormitory at the Grove- High
School were discussed at length
at a meeting of the joint boards
of the school held at the city hall
on Thursday of last week, and
all of those present not only ex
pressed themselves as willing to
take an active part in the cam
paign to secure the necessary
funds but signified their inten
tion of contributing liberally.
Dr. E. W. Grove was present
at the meeting and took a lead
ing part in the discussion of the
past present and future needs
of the school, showing special
interest in the agricultural and
domestic science departments of
the school. Dr. Grove desires
very much to see these depart
ments maintained and developed.
The boys dormitory which it
is planned to erect will cost
about $20,000. This building is
very much needed and will be of
great and lasting benefit to boys
and young men who live in the
smaller towns and rural districts
of Henry county and who desire
to attend Grove. It will enable
them to get accomodations at
actual cost and will mean a great
saving to them.
Another meeting of the joint
boards, of which Dr. George L.
Powers is chairman and Joe
Routon secretary will be held on
Saturday April 13 and a
mass meeting of the citizens of
Paris and Henry county will be,
held on the same date, at 1 o'clock h
in the afternoon, for the purpose
of discussing the needs of the
school. The call for the mass
meeting has been issued by Sec
retary Routon.
