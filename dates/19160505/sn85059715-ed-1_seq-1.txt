IB* ASSOCIATED FRKBI) i
WASHINGTON, May ??.?President
"Wilson and the cabinet went care
fully over the German note as trans- 1
mltted In news despatches from Ber- I
lin.
A first feeling that it was unsatis- ?
factory was somewhat leavened by |
the text of the new orders to subma
rine commanders although it was
foreseen that the reference to iinmu- |
nity "for mercluuit ships recognized
by international law" might admit
of some dispute of interpretation.
So much dejK'nds n|x?n words and !
their shares of meaning invof'ved in j
translation from (ierman to Knglish
that no decision can be attempted un
til the oflicial text is in the presi- ;
dent's hands.
Ambassador cabled today that he
had started it on the cables last]
night. It ought to be in Washing- ?
ton tonight or early tomorrow.
Two views were current in oflicial |
circle**. One was that Germany has 1
declared its intention of abondoning,
its "present methods of submarine;
warfare" as demanded by the presi- j
dent, and that the American govern- |
uient might have to wait to see |
whether the abandonment will be ef-(
fected.
The other was that the United
States already having attempted to
have Great Britain give up its in
terference with neutral commerce
f and having told Germany that it can
not discuss with it its negotiations
with Great Britain has no course but
to break diplomatic relations with,
Germany While the general tone of j
the German note created an unfa
vorable impression, officials took the
position that the language was im-j
material if the guarantees were real.
Germany's declaration that it had;
issued new orders to submarine com- i
manders not to attack without warn-:
ing "merchant vessels recognized by j
International law" was the chief
point. The German view of mer- i
chant vessels are detined in its dec-;
laration of February 8 of its pur-1
pose to sink armed ships without
warning and the American view as
defined in the armed ship memoran-;
dum made public recently differ in!
several points.
Some ofllciala believe that for this
reason the controversy has now come
to the point where Germany's future'
actions would determine the course;
of the United States.
The refusal of the German gov
ernment to openly admit the attack
on the Sussex was considered only
incidental to the main issue.
Until President Wilson himself de
ckles whether the German noto is
acceptable there will be no an
nouncement of the attitude of the
government.
(BY ASVOCIATIO PNISI)
WASHINGTON. May 5.?The first
portions of the German note were
read by officials today with undis
guised disappointment. The tonei
o fthe first portion was of such char- j
acter that some officials feared a i
break in diplomatic relations.
The unofficial copy was sent to
President Wilson as rapidly as it was
received. He had no engagements
outside of the cabinet meeting which
was expected to be devoted almost
exclusively to the German situation.
No action will be taken until the
official text of the note has arrived
and has been studied by the presi
| dent and Secretary Lansing. The
| president has already discussed with
his cabinet steps to be taken in case
the note was found to be unsatisfac
tory. ?
The official text is expected to be
here before Sunday, the anniversary
of the sinking of the Lusitanla. It
was generally expected that whatever
'action is taken by the American gov
ernment probably will come on that
day.
The president had already inform
ed Congress of his intention to break
| relations with Germany in case its
| reply is unsatisfactory and therefore,
j it is believed he has decided not to
: go before Congress again before talt
| ing the action.

GENERAL CONFERENCE
TO MEET THIS MONTH
West Virginia Will Be Repre
sented by Ten Ministers
and Ten Laymen.
The general conference of the
Methodist Protestant church will
meot in quadrlennlai session in
Zanesville, O., May 19, with dele
gates from forty conferences In the
United States. The church also sus
tains missions in China and Japan
which will be represented.
The Methodist Protestant church
makes no apologies for its existence,
although it is counted among the
pmaller bodies of MethodlBts. In doc
trine it recognizes Jesus Christ as
the only head of the church and the
Word of God as the only rule for
faith and practice. In policy it is
unique among other Methodist
churches. It Is truly American with
its government "of the people, for the
people and by the people." General
Orant said: "The most American
church In America." Its principles,
which must always be at the founda
tion of all laws of a free people, be
gan to be agitated immediately upon
the organization of the Methodists of
America about the time of the Revo
lutionary war, although the Metho
dist Protestant church was not organ
ized until 182$, the founders deter,
mining to stand in that liberty where
with Wesley said "God had so
strangely made them free." Its law
making body and court of Onal resort
Is the general conference, which is
composed of an equal number of min
isters and laymen sitting together in
one body with equal rights. This
body elects a president and an execu
tive committee which continue in of
fice fouV years. No change can be
made in the constitution without first
submitting the question to the annual
conference by way of an overture
and It must receive a majority vote
of two-thirds of all the annual con
fcrenccs and so certified by the pres
ident to become a law. The church
has no bishops nor presiding elders.
'Bach annual conference elects a pres
ident from its own body for a term
of one year and a standing district
committee to which the'buslness of
the conference is referred during the
Interim of Its sessions. All church'
property, except schools and colleges,
U owned and controlled by the local
congregation without Interference
from any source whatever.
The West Virginia annual confer
ence will be represented in the gen
eral conference at Zanesville by ten
ministers and ten laymen elected by
the annual conference which held Its
sessions In Grafton last August
The conference will be In session ? '
about two weeks and will elect editors
of all the official papers and Sunday
school literature. It will elect the
various boards of the church and a
secretary-treasurer of each. AmonK
the Important measures to be consid
ered will be one to group and officer
all the annual conferences of the
gerat Southwest for more aggressive
work. The educational interests of
the church will be at the front tnrl
manj- other important matters will
tall (or consideration.
