DIPLOMATIC SPLIT
Germany's Note on Submarine Question Parries With
Issues Taken Up by Am erican Government and
Urges Action Against Blockade.
BREACH OF RELATIONS SEEMS CERTAIN
End of Friendly Connection s Foreshadowed Officials in
Washington Aver Secretary Lansing
and Cabinet Members Silent.
(Text of Note on Page 14)
Washington, May 5. The first portions of the Ger
man note were read by officials here with undisguised
disappointment. Some officials feared a break in diplo
matic relations was forecast.
The unofficial copy was sent to President Wilson as
rapidly as it was received. He had no engagements to
day outside of the cabinet meeting, which was expected
to be devoted almost exclusively to the German situation.
No action will be taken until the official text of the
note has arrived here and has been studied by the presi
dent and Secretary Lansing. The president has already
discussed with his cabinet the steps to be taken in case
the note was found to be unsatisfactory.
The official text is expected he
tore Sunday, the anniversary of the
sinking of the Lusitania. It was
generally expected that whaler
action is taken by the American
government probably will come on
that day.
The president ha. already in
formed congress of his intention to
break relations with Germany in
case her reply is unsatisfactory
and therefore it is believed he has
ecided not to go before congress
again before taking the action.
The state, department's only offi
cial information on the German
note just before 11 o'clock this
morning was a dispatch from Am
bassador Gerard sent last night,
saying he had received the docu
ment from the Berlin foreign of
fice and that he was at once cod
ing it and starting it by cable.
The unofficial copy was laid before
the cabinet. One chief point for con
sideration seemed to be Germany's
reference to the immunity of "mer
chant vessels recognized by interna
tional law." This was regarded as
having possibilities of relating to the
dispute over questions of armament
and alleged instructions of the Brit
ish admiralty to merchant captains to
attack submarines.
Bad Impression .Not Relieved.
The first impresion in official cir
cles was that the full text did not
much relieve the unfavorable impres
sion rreated by the opening portions.
It was admitted the new instructions
to submarine commanders would have
to be weighed and considered very
carefully before their acceptability to
this government could be determined.
Touched In Armed Ship Issue.
The recent declaration of the state
department on the status of armed
merchant ships touches upon this
point It held:
"It is necessary for a belligerent
warship to determine the status of
an armed merchant vessel of an en
emy encountered on the high seas.
"The determination of warlike char
acter must rest in no case upon pre
sumption but upon conclusive evi
dence because the responsibility for
the destruction of life and property
depends on the actual farts of the
case and cannot be avoided or lessened
by a standard of evidence which a
belligerent may announce as creating
presumption of hostile character.
On the other hand, to safeguard him
self from possible liability for unwar
ranted destruction of life and prop
erty, the belligerent should, in the
absence of conclusive evidence, act on
the presumption that an armed mer
chantman is of peaceable character.
Armed Ship Not Warship.
"A presumption based solely on the
Presence of an armament on a mer
chant vessel of an enemy is not a suffic
ient reason for a belligerent to declare
it to be a warship and proceed to at
tack it without regard to the rights of
the persons on board. Conclusive evi
dence of a purpose to use the arma
Dipnt for aggression is essential."
( Sudoiaxuiag tha-itaiua-ot a, -mer
chant ship on the high seas the decla
ration held:
"The status of such a vessel as a
warship on the high seas must be de
termined only upon conclusive evi
dence of aggressive purpose in the ab
sence of which it is to be presumed
that the vessel has a private and
peaceable character and it should be
so treated by an enemy warship."
Provision is Made.
The declaration, however, recog
nized that armed merchant ships might
be acting under instructions to attack
enemy warships and made this provis
ion: "A vessel engaged intermittently in
commerce and under a commission or
orders of its government imposing a
penalty in pursuing and attacking en
emy naval craft, possesses a status
tainted with a hostile purpose, which
it cannot throw aside or assume at
will. Any person taking passage on
such a vessel cannot expect immunity
other than that accorded persons who
are on board a warship."
This declaration, at first intended to
be communicated to all the powers in
a memorandum, was issued as a state
ment of this government's attitude by
direction of President Wilson and was
communicated to all the powers.
Cabinet .Members Silent.
When the cabinet meeting broke up
Secretary Lansing met all inquiries
with this reply: "I cannot discuss it at
all at this time."
Wilson to Decide Course.
While the general tone of the Ger
man note created an unfavorable im
pression, officials took the position
that the language was immaterial if
the guarantees were real.
The refusal of the German govern
ment to openly admit the attack on
the Sussex was considered only inci
dental to the main issue.
Until President Wilson himself de
cides whether the German note is ac
ceptable there will be no announce
ment of the attitude of the govern
ment. At the state department, after the
cabinet meeting, It was stated that no
"hasty" action would be taken on the
German note and that in view of its
length and the necessity of digesting
it carefully it was improbable that
any decision would be reached before
next week.

REVIEW AMERICAN
AND GERMAN NOTES
Washington, May 5. Germany's
diplomatic correspondence with the
United States on the submarine issue
has extended over nearly a year. All
along President Wilson has spoken
primarily for the inviolable rights of
Americans and generally for the rights
of neutrals.
Submarine warfare did not actually
enter the realm of diplomacy until the
destruction of the Lusitania. The ac
cumulation of cases affecting Ameri
cans was fHcn up in the first note to
Germany, which was dispatched May
15, 1315. It characterized the attacks
on the Falaba, Cushing, Bulflight and
Lusitania as a "series of events which
the United States has observed with
growing concern, distress and amaze
ment" The note closed with tnese words:
"The imperial German government
will not expect the government of the
United States to omit any word or act
necessary to the performance of its sa
cred duty of maintaining the rights of
the United States and its citizens and
of safeguarding their free exercise and
judgment."
May 28, 1915, Germany replied with
a note which was in every respect un
satisfactory. The note met none of
the contentions of the United States so
far as the Lusitania and Falaba sink
ings were concerned, although a sup
plementary note later did acknowledge
that Germany was wrong In the at
tacks on the Cushing and the Gulf
light, expressed regret for those two
cases and promised to pay damages.
While the American reply to the
note was being framed, dissension in
the cabinet resulted in the resignation
of Secretary Bryan. He resigned be
cause he thought he could not sign the
next note to Germany, which he feared
would lead the United States into war.
Lansing Takes Issue.
Secretary Lansing took office as Mr.
Bryan's successor and his reply to the
German note took issue with every
contention that the Lusitania was
armed or was to be treated as other
than a peaceful merchant ship and re
minded Germany that it was the duty
of the United States "to speak with
solemn emphasis, to call the attention
of the imperial German government to
the grave responsibility which the
government of the United States con
ceives that it has incurred in this trag
ic occurrence and to the indisputable
principle upon which that responsibil
ity rests." The note averred that the
declaration of a submarine war zone
could not abbreviate the rights of
Americans on lawful journeys.
To that note Germany did not reply
until July 8 and the German rejoiner
was preponderately characterized by
American newspapers, not as a note,
but as an address by Foreign Minister
von Jagow to the American people. In
official circles it was said to come no
nearer to meeting the American con
tentions than did the former German
note.
The nature of the reply was regard
ed officially as convincing evidenc
that Germany was holding the nego
tiations as a club over the United
States to force this government into
some action to compel Great Britain
to relax the food blockade.
President Wilson steadfastly refused
to permit the diplomatic negotiations
of the United States with one bellig
erent to become entangled, with the
relations with another.
America Disappointed.
To that the United States replied on
July 21 that the German note failed to
meet "the real differences between the
two governments." The United States,
it declared, was "keenly disappointed"
with Germany's attitude. Submarine
attacks without warning endangering
Americans and other neutrals were
characterized as "illegal and inhuman"
and "manifestly indefensible." It de
clared that the United States would
continue to contend for the freedom of
the seas "from whatever quarter vio
lated, without compromise and at any
costs."
The negotiations at this point
seemed to have come to such an im
passe that the exchanges of notes be
tween Washington and Berlin were
stopped and that controversy was
brought into the realm of "informal
conversations" between Secretary
Lansing and Count von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador. It was thought
that much could be accomplished by
I personal contact which was lost in a
1 cold ciUiAato til documents.

A
More Rebels
Executed by
the English
Dublin, May 4. Four more rebel
prisoners were sentenced to death
by court martial and shot this
morning. This was announced of
ficially. The men were Joseph
Plunkett, Edward Daly, Michael
O'llanrahan and William Pearse.
Fifteen other rebels were sentenced
to death, the official statement adds
but later their sentences were com
muted to 10 years' penal servitude.
The death sentence of another pris
oner was commuted to eight years'
penal servitude. Two rebels were sen
tenced to 10 years in prison.
The following official communication
was issued this afternoon (Thursday) :
"Four prisoners, Joseph Plunkett,
Edward Daly, Michael O'Hanrahan and
William Pearse, were sentenced to
death and shot this morning.
"Fifteen others sentenced to death
were commuted to 10 years' penal
servitude. They are: Thomas Be
van, Thomas Walsh, Finian Lynch,
Michael Mervyn, Dennis O'Callahan, P.
L. Sweeney, Patrick McNestry, Peter
Clancy, William Tobin, George Irvine,
John Doherty, J. J. Walsh, James Mc
Linn, J. J. Reid and John Williams.
"Another prisoner, John McGarry,
was commuted from death to eight
years.
"Two others, Francis Fahey and
Richard Davys, were sentenced to 10
years."
Joseph Plunkett, court martialed
and shot by order of the British gov
ernment Thursday was one of the
seven original signers of the procla
mation of the Irish provisional gov
ernment. When Patrick H. Pearse,
provisional president, and Thomas J.
Clarke and Thomas MacDonagh met a
similar fate, it was announced in cable
dispatches that of the remaining four
signers of the proclamation, Blunkett
and James Connolly were in prison
and that S. MacDiarmad and E. Ceannt
had not been accounted for.
Plunkett was a member of the Cath
olic braneh of the famous Irish family
of that name.
Mr. Tearse was a brother of Patrick
H. Pearse. He was a sculptor and was
once a tutor in the Irish boys' school,
of which his brother was head master.
Edward Daly and Michael O'Hanra
han, also among the rebels killed yes
terday, have not played prominent
roles in the revolutionary movement
so far as cable dispatches indicated.

ZEPPELIN BLOWN
UP BY NORSEMEN
Copenhagen; May 5. The military
authorities at Stavanger, Norway,
blew up the Zeppelin L-20 yesterday
when it began to roll dangerously in a
strong wind. Soldiers fired upon the
airship from a distance of 60 yards.
The Zeppelin exploded with great de
tonation and was burned.
The L-20 was one of the squadron
of Zeppelins which raided the east
coasts of England and Scotland Tues
day night. On her return journey she
was blown ashore on the Norwegian
coast, hurled against a mountain side
and wrecked.
BERNSTORFF ON
WAY TO CAPITAL
New York, May 5. Count von Bern
storff, the German ambassador, left
for Washington today on a 1 o'clock
train after having received by wire
less telegraph at his hotel here the
text of the German note. The ambas
sador denied himself to interviewers.
It is known, however, that the Ger
man embassy view is that the note is
all for which the United States asked;
that it signals a return to the opera
tion of submarines as cruisers, inter
cepting commerce with visit and
search. The embassy view is that in
asmuch as no mention was made in
the note of the question of armament
it is not a complicating feature.
