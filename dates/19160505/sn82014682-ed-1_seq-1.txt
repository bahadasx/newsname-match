Germany thinks it useless to enter into a tuscussion ot details con-:
cerning the' carrying-out of the submarine campaign, while America,
as the note alleges, is making unsubstantiated assertions and demanding
concrete (acts in reply as the basis of communication. Germany also
holds that through her naval department she has imposed restraints
on her submarines out of consideration of neutrals and their Tights,
despite the fact that such restrictions are advantageous to her enemies.
"Allies Have Showed No Such ConsideraUon,
The Allies, the note corftends, have shown no such consideration.
Meanwhile the German submarines have been ordered to proceed In
accordance with international law, upon the search and destruction of
vessels of hostile belligerents, the exception being that of enemy freight
ers. in the .war-zone. - ,,';: '. "' .y. V:,'": -' ' '"
. Assurances regarding these freighters were not given in the Ger-;
man pronuncjamento of February 8, it is pointed out.
Extracts from the note, relating to the commercial blockade, against
Germany, are as follows : , ' . .
"The German submarines had orders to conduct their warfare
iniccordance with international law. Germany cannot admit any doubt
that these orders were given and executed in good faith. ' If errors
Actually occurred, they ; can in no kind of warfare be avoided alto
gether. .'?.' y--' -::-;.!. '-;:; -: .-;:.:-'v '-:'- ',-.- .';'
"England again and again has violated international law, surpass
ing all bounds and outraging neutral rights. ; ; : ' .
'The Germans know that the United States has -the power lo
confine the.war to armed forces of the belligerents in the interest of
humanity and the maintenance of international law. -
"The Germans are aware of the extent to which their memies Iiavc
been supplied with war material from the United States.' .
Germany also emphasizes that she has repeatedly mentioned the
dangers of mines to neutrals travelling by sea, and has made proposals
to reduce these dangers, but unfortunately; the note continues, America
has not accepted these proposals. . ' ';."' ' '''.'.';':'.;. - :
Germany stands by her offer to reach an agreement upon the issues
at hand, the United States is informed. But-Germany cannot dispense
with the submarine. .Still, the Imperial German government has de
cided to make further concessions in the interests of neutral nations.
Twice within, the last few months, the note declares, Germany,
conscious of her strength, has announced her readiness to make pea.ee
on a basis which would safeguard Germany's vital interests.- -
New Orders Given to Submarine Commnd:ri
The note continues that Germany is prepared to do her utmost to.
confine her submarine operations so that the freedom of the seas shall
be insured, and, in conclusion, the note says: . , v- '. ' '
"Guided by this idea, Germany hereby notifies the United States
that German naval officers have received the following instructions : :
" In accordance with the general principles governing the' vi3it,
search and destruction of merchant vessels, as recognized by , inter
national law, such vessels, within or without the . war-zone, shall net
be sunk without warning or without saving lives, unless they attempt
to escape or resist.' . - ' '" ' ' V ' v .' - ' '"
