flontative of all the British newspapers
Tnin ine fTencn armies, sends the fol
lowing picture of war-battered and de
serted Verdun:
Today, Verdun Is not crowded. Not
a shop is open. It can muster three
civilians, and all three of them are
rightly proud of their courage in stay
ing in the bombarded town.
I have just been walking down the
main street. Everywhere there Is al

big shells and the Bound of splinters

heard the shell the danger Is over"
As we went up the steep, lonely
streets towards the cathedral our at
tention was suddenly attracted by a
"ronge, piercing sound that con
trasted quaintly with the continuing
roar of exploding shells. It was a
mtten mewing plaintively In the first
story of a house. It had obviously
been forgotten in the haste of evacua

osed up the shutters and had never
given a thought to the poor beast and
was slowly starring to death.
A rescue party was at once formed,

my snouioers and endeavored
to pry open the shutter with a stick,
oui nis efforts were unavailing, and
eventually the kitten's life was saved
by the firemen of Verdun, who, at our
request, broke into the house.
Several large shells had fallen near
the cathedral. One of them had gut
ted a girls' school and another had
landed fair and square on a shop that
sold religious ornaments and emblems.
For some unexplained reason there
was a cure's hat lying pathetically on
the top of the debris, and at the back
against a wall that had miraculously
escaped destruction stood a stucco
statue of Joan of Arc.

The pigeons, which were flvlno- In
uneasy circles above the cathedral,
seemed to be curiously disturbed by
the bombardment. As a general rule,
the birds seem to regard bombardment
as a natural cataclysm, to be suffered
since it cannot be prevented. Anyhow,
the pigeons of Verdun have not yet
grown accustomed to the noise of the
German bombardment.
Despite German shells, the French
gendarmes keep a good watch in Ver
dun. There Is no pillaging, and the
refugees who in their hurry left their
house windows open and doors un
locked can sleep easy as to the con
tents of their houses, except in so far
as an enemy projectile may reduce
them to powder. Just near one of the
gates there is a house of whinh ,
shutters have not been closed and
the window Is still open. It seems
that Just before the evacuation the
owner of the house had some special
occasion to celebrate. Looking through
the window one can see a table laid
for 16 persons and everything pre
pared for an excellent meal. There
was a beautiful, clean tablecloth with
napkins folded miter-shaped for every
guest. Decanters of wine.
white, were standing beside each plate.
un me smeDoara plies of oranges and
apples were waiting for the party
which was never to eat them.
The gendarmes in Verdun seem tn
keep a catalogue of the shells whir-h
fall In the town. Those who live In
bombarded towns take a definite pride
in showing the visitors the hnlna mode
by German projectiles and the houses
that they had thoroughly destroyed.
It was with an expression of the great
est satisfaction that one of the gen
darmes asked us to come and see
his gate, because, during the previous
night he had counted 117 big shells
that had fallen into its neighborhood.
M. Scott, the artist, remarked to me:

lucky circumstances, there is absolute

matter for the musician, not the artist.
Perhaps the musician of the future
will be able to convert Into terms of

may hear in a bombarded town."
The clnematographers have been
taking everything thev can find in xrr.
dun, and their only grief is that so far
no shell has burst near enough tc
