of all nationalitiea to all destinations.
It reiteratea that Germany ha Im
posed far-reaching restrictions on
submarine use, the condition of
which England has never shown to
neutral. It says England la trying to
etarv th civil population of Ger
many, and Germany cannot abandon
Its submarln warfare against "enemy
trade," but ' has no decided to make
further concessions by adapting Its
submarine warfare to the neutrals' In
terest It says England flatty refuses
to grant the American demanda rela

Shipping Industry Strictly Adminis
tered by Admiralty, Nearly Half
Used for War Purposes.
- London, May 5. Admiral - Baron
Charles Beresford called the attention
of the house of lords yesterday to the
depletion in tbe tonnage of British
ships needed for trade purposes, as
serting that unless it were remedied,
It would endanger the supply of food,
and asked the government to consult
the harbor leaders with a view to ob
taining more labor for ship building.
In reply. Earl Curzon said tbe gov
ernment I now administering the
whole ...British ,' mercantile . maxlns,
amounting to half the gross tonnage
of the world. Forty-three per cent
of the British tonnage, he added, has
been requisitioned for naval and mili
tary purposes, 14 per cent 1 occupied
In carrying foodstuff and raw ma
terial in behalf of the government and
It allies and the remaining 43 per
rent Is being operated by British ship
owners under strict regulations.
'Our ships are carrying supplies of
coal, grain, food, tiinljer, munitions
and the raw material munitions to all
our allies on un unprocedented scale,"
continued Earl Curson, "but for these
supplies to France, Russia and Italy,
they would be dependent upon then-
own totally Inadequate resource.
"In several Instances the shortage
of tonnage haa been balanced by new
ships. It Is surprising that w stood
the strain so welL Five hundred ves
sels of all sort are being built and
the number of small sraft added to
the mercantile marine ha been mora
than 100."
Personally, Earl Curzon said he
would like to see a much greater re
striction of Import, but th great dif
ficulty wa how to satisfy the con
Dieting Interests of th allies and the
dominions. Tbe government had en
gaged a considerable' number of Can
adian lumbermen to cut timber In this
country and 1500 of them were now
on their way to 'England. By using
British supplies of timber. for sleep
er, pit prop and other purposes, he
believed England would be less de
pendent upon foreign supplies.
