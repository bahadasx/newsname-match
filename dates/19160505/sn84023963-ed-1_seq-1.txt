would be j'.:st as correct to say that
we do not know what matter is as
that we do not know what electrici

not know what matter is, and the
latest plausible theory of it bidlds
it up on an electric basis, so that on
this theorv the idea of electricity is
more fundamental than that of
matter. Unfortunately our senseJ

matter and are trained to detect
only matter. Electricity they know
only secondarily, through its action

it causes matter to give out, the at

auctions of stock each day at noo

opportunities for each other.
Some of the broker specialists re
sented such a restricted organiza
tion, and on March 21 a meeting
was called of the dissatisfied brokers
for purposes of protection, and a
committee was appointed to pro
vide a suitable room in which to
assemble and to suggest such rules
and regulations for conducting
their business as the committee
deemed necessary. The final result
of this meeting, says Moody's Mag-
. n n i
azine, was tne nrst signea agree
ment among dealers in securities,
the oldest record now in the ar
chives of the New York Stock Ex
change. The agreement reads as
f 0Ü0W3 :
"We, the Subscribers, Brokers
for the purchase and Sale of Public
Stock, do hereby solemnly promise
and pledge ourselves to each other,
that we will not buy or sell from
this day, for any person whatsoever,

that we will give a preference to

being the originator and promotor of
most of the new and improved fea

this country.
The storv of Fisher's life is more
exciting and thrilling than fiction. His
meteoric rise by his own efforts has
made him not only a captain of indus

the Indianapolis Speedway is even
greater thanto merely entertain. He
sees in this track a school for all auto
