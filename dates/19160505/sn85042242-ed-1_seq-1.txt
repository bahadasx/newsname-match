Secretary of State Refused to Al-
low Handling of Petitions
Yesterday.
MUST BE TABULATED
BEFORE BEING SEEN
Governor Hanna Recommends
Placing Petitions in Charge
of One Man.
•After gome 600 names had been
copied off the New Rockford capital
removal petitions yesterday morning,
by stenographers sent to the capitol
by the Bismarck Taxpayers Protective
league, the secretary of state refused
to allow any more names to be copied
and stated that the petitions would be
kept under lock and key until they
had been properly tabulated by his
office.
The taxpayers league was anxious
to verify a number of the signatures,
and for this reason were desirous of
securing name.-*, from the various coun­
ty petitions. The action of the secre­
tary of state, however, precludes all
possibility of this before next Monday,
the last day on which petitions can be
tiled. At the same time it is not too
late for signers to have their names
stricken from the lists, and it is ru­
mored that a great many names will
be withdrawn before next Monday.
"Guard" for Petitions.
After the secretary of state refused
to allow the petitions to be seen, an
informal conference was held among
several of the state officers, and the
question discussed unofficially. Cov
Hanna recommended that the peti­
tions be placed in charge of one man,
so that anyone who cared to could
look them over under the eyes of the
man in charge could do so.
This suggestion was not followed,
however, and the petitions will remain
a closed book, as it were, until after
they have been completely tabulated
and arranged by the secretary of
sta^e.
Voters who signed the petitions are
urged, however, tJ withdraw their
names before next Monday. A signed
request addressed to the secretary of
state is all that necessary for that
purpose. Names can be withdrawn at
any time up to next Monday, the last
day for filing.
Congressman Makes a Trip to
Look Over Indian School
Needs.
Leslie Simpson and Congressman
Norton bumped into each other on the
streets of Bismarck yesterday. Mr.
Norton was on his way back to Wash­
ington from a trin home to look after
his political fences. Mr. Simpson was
here on his way east. Mr. Norton left
last evening for Washington and
Simpson took the same train for east­
ern point's.
Mr. Simpson announced his
cajididacy formally yet. He has more
than two weeks yet in which to file
his pettions.
While here Congressman Norton
took a trip to the Indian school. He
has been working with Congressman
Young to secure a larger appropria­
tion. A $35,000 dormitory will be
built there this year.

HAS ORDERED INQUIRY.
•Rio Janeiro, May 4.—The Brazilian

SHERIFF AIDS PRISON
ER'S FAMILY
iFargo, N. D., May 3.—Sheriff J. p.
Ross has a heart. Just four days
after arresting George Knapp for sell­
ing whiskey over the counter in his
meat market, which resulted in a jail
sentence of toinetv days and a fine
of |200, Ross has volunteered to help
finance the meat business for Knapp's
family while the prisoner serves time.
Both Secretary Lansing and Minis­
ter Brun positively refused to discuss
the subject, but it is recognized that
such an attitude would of necessity
be observed, in the initial stages of
any negotiations of this kind.
Intimations have come to Washing­
ton recently that Danish govern­
ment itself, embarrassed by serious
labor troubles which have occurred in
the West Indies, resulting in curtail­
ment of revenue and making neces­
sary appropriation by the homo gov­
ernment, would not be adverse to the
reopening of the negotiations for the
cessation of the group.

CONFRERES DISAGREE.
Washington, May 4.—'Confreres on

RECEIVES SOME
Washington, May 4.—Attorney Gen­
eral Gregory announced tonight that
he had received conclusive informa­
tion about the source of the money
spent deluging members of the house
and senate last week, urging members
that no steps be taken which would
lead to war between the United States
and Germany. He refused to reveal
the source, but said that a statement
might be given out by the department
of justice in a few days, who was ask­
ed yesterday by Senator Husting of
Wisconsin to have the department of
justice to investigate the subject.
It was learned tonight that govern­
ment officials seriously are consider­
ing making public at least some of the
documents seized in the office of
Wolffe von llle, secretary to Capt. von
Papen, formal military attache of the
German embassy here. Count von
Bernstorff has demanded the return of
the papers and the question is still
pending.
One Physician Refuses to Give
Milk Inspection a Clean
Bill.
BODENSTAB AND SMYTH
DO "RESOLUTING"
Appointed by Burleigh County
Medical Association to Defend
Milk Supply.
The resolution committee of the
Burleigh County Medical association
struck a snag in their attempt to dis­
credit the agitation for better milk
inspection. One of the most promi­
nent doctors in the city refused to
sign the resolutions and act as a
member of the "roasting committee"
appointed at a recent meeting of the
association.
When ul*. l«\ R. Smyth and Dr. \V
H. E'odenstab failed to secure the oth­
er physician's signature, who by thd
way is one of the official health offi­
cers, tliey decided to do the "resolut
ing" themselves and forwarded a
copy of their literary effort to the
Tribune by mail last evening.
Ancient History.
Alter reading the resolutions, the
Tribune finds that the medical gen­
tlemen touch upon much that is not
lelevant to the controversy. This pa­
per has contended that the milk in­
spection under the city bacteriologist
is a fiasco. We agree with Dr. Smyth
and Dr. Bodenstal) that previous to
t.be arrival of Joseph Winslow, the
inspection was fair and intelligent.
We are glad to note that in tlu: res­
olutions the physicians say:
there is ample room for
improvement, of the city milk inspec
tion."
Did Not Say It.
The doctors in their resolutions
state that the Tribune in criticizing
the administration of the state health
laboratory stated that physicians paid
the local laboratory for examinations
made for health work.. Thi^ js .not, so
We did- state that physicians were
compelled to pay a fee for work done
for them personally and that the clos­
ing of the laboratory here would not
work a great hardship, as many of
them send their specimens elsewhei*.
anyway.
Slap Pasteurized Milk.
While the Tribune is not learned in
medicine, it cannot agree with the
doctors that pasteurized milk is in­
ferior to inspected inilk. Large cit­
ies find pasteurization the only safe
means of regulating the milk supply.
We suggest that the worthy doctors
investigate Minneapolis, Chicago and
New York.
A Little Brain Storm.
Why the physicians, that is, a few
of them, should rush to the defense
of the milk supply which everyone
knows is about as poor as it can be,
is one of the mysteries. We might
say the physicians' attitude is a prob
lent in phychiatric.s that need not be
discussed in this report. A problem
in "psychiatrics'' is the name the
worthy doctors apply to the attitude
of the Tribune. We like the sound
of it and pass it back with our com
pliments. Just Set y°ur dictionaries
out and by their aid follow the learn
ed gentlemen. It applies with equal
force to the resolutions propounded
by the worthy physicians.
The fact that the physicians fail to
agree upon the case of the Tribune
takes the sting out of the resolutions
which we do not care to publish in
full, as they represent merely a mi­
nority decision.
A jarge number of our readers who
have to drink iBismarck milk have
commended our action. As we said
before, editorially, the approval of our
readers interests us more than the
physicans' defense of Bismarck's milk
supply.
A Hotel Incident.
While we are on the subject, we
will give one instance of 'Mr. Win
slow's "fair and impeccable milk in
spection," which we trust the physi­
cians will investigate.
Some time ago, Mr. Winslow saw
fit to enter the kitchen of a certain
hotel and procured a sample of its
milk. This milk was purchased by
the hotel from a local dealer. Mr

Patient Leaps From
Second Story Window
Mr. Olson of E'raddock, a patient at
the Bismarck hospital under the care
of Quain & iRam.stad, local physicians,
jumped out of a second-story window
of that institution yesterday morning,
clad only in his night dress. He ap­
peared asleep when the nurse left
him, but she had no sooner disap­
peared than the patient made his leap
and started to sprint up Sixth str^ft,'
calling for Quain & Ramstad. It was
evident that the man was delirious
and his appearance attracted consid­

Several joined in the chase, and Ol­
son was caught and brought back to
his room in the Bismarck hospital.
Much excitement prevailed on the sec­
ond floor. Olson jumped more than
20 feet and that he escaped without
serious injury seems miraculous. He
was 'brought to the 'Bismarck hospi­
tal Tuesday, suffering from an abscess
of the kidqey and his condition is con­
sidered very serious.
He was reported as resting more
quietly and a close watch is being
kept upon him.

"i
President Wrilson Issues State­
ment in Regard to Conefer-
ence to Date.
Washington, May 4.—President Wil­
son announced tonight that the tenia
tive agreement between Gen. Scott
and Gen. Obregon, covering the future
operations of the Mexican and Ameri­
can forces in Mexico provides "a basis
of co-operation which promises to pre­
vent misunderstanding and strength­
en the cordial relations of the two re­
publics."
FINAL MEETING WILL
BE HELD TOMORROW
El Paso, May 4.—The final meeting
between Generals Scott and Qbregon,
at which the details of the agreement
for the co-operative pursuit of Villa
bandits by Mexican and American
troops will be worked out, will be held
either late tomorrow or early Satur­
day.
This is the information Ceil. Scott
is understood to have conveyed to
Gen. Obregon today during a brief
"courteous visit" he made to the .Mexi­
can minister of war in the hitter's pri­
vate car in Juarez.
As Gen. Obregon possesses plenary
powers, he will be able to make any
arrangement to satisfy the wishes of
the Washington government as to the
exact form the agreement will take.
Gen. P. Elias ('ales, military gover­
nor of Sonora,"arrived this afternoon
for a conference regarding routine
matters.
Gen. Cales proceeded later to Quer
retero to join Gen. Carranza.
Gen. Trevino received a report' that
Villa bandits undei (he notorious Rob
ies last'flight aiMnptfed to cut the
railway track between Jiminez and
Escalon, but were frustrated and rout­
ed by Carranza forces under Gen.
Ignatio Romas.
PLANS ARE ACCEPTABLE
TO WASHINGTON GOV'T,
Washington, May 4.—Notification
that the plans of co-operative action
in the Mexican border region, mapped
out at the El Paso conference, is ac­
ceptable to the Washington govern­
ment, was forwarded to Gen. Scott
late today by Secretary Baker.
Secretary Baker carried to tho
White House today Gen. Scott's re­
port. of his meeting with Gen. Obregon
at which the agreement was worked
out. Later, he also informed Secre­
tary Lansing of the plan. Instructions
to Gen. Scott authorizing him to hold
a final conference with Gen. Obregon
then were prepared.
It is exnected President Wilson will
issue a formal statement regarding
the agreement as soon as word comes
that Gen. Carn«7i has approved it.
Use of the Mexican railways to keep
Americans supplied is orovided, and
in return the expeditionary forces are
pledged to exert every precaution to
avoid clashes with the townspeople in
the regions in which they will act.
The limitations of the expedition un­
der the agreement have not been dis­
closed. It is understood, however,
that it will hold the present line for
the time being and not proceed to the
south in any event.
AUTHORIZED TO EXCHANGE
FORMAL ACCEPTANCES
Washington, May 4.—Although
there was -no formal announcement of
the action, notification that the Scott
Obregon agreement is acceptable to
the American government was tele­
graphed to Gen. Scott at El Paso to­
day by Secretary Baker. Gen. Scott
is authorized to exchange formal ac­
ceptances with Gen. Obregon as soon
as the latter has obtained the approv­
al of Gen. Carr- *», and officials here
are confident that it will be tomorrow
or Saturday.
President Wilson issued this state­
ment:
"I have examined with the Secre­
tary of war the report made by Gen.
Hugh L. Scott, of the conference be­
tween him and Gen. Obregon, secre­
tary of war of the Republic of Mexico.
"The report includes a tentative
agreement covering the future opera­
tions of both the American and Mexi­
can forces and evidences cordial co­
operation between the govern­
ments in their common purpose.
"As this agreement is being sub­
mitted to the de facto government in
Mexico, it would not be proper for me
to permit its publication until that
government has had opportunity to
examine and consider its provisions.
The full text of the proposed agree­
ment will be given out immediately
on its acceptance by both govern­
ments. In general, I may sa that it
provides a basis for co-operation and
which promises to prevent misunder­
standing and strengthen the cordial
relations of the two republics."

"Every leading statesman in South
America with whom I talked empha­

St. Paul, May 4.—A man believed
by the police to be Russel Wyse, of
Sonimerville, Mass., was shot dead
here tonight by police detectives,
when he failed to halt in response to
commands of the detectives. The
shooting occurred in the Union depot
yards. Early in the day the police
were notified that a man answering
the description of the one who held
up the City Bank of St. Paul last
week had been seen to leave a pas­
sage at a certain spot in the yard. De­
tectives were sent to the place. Later
two men came there. As they ap­
proached the place, the detectives
called on them to halt. Both men ran.
A shower of bullets were sent after
tliem and Wyse fell. He was dead
when the detectives reached his body.

infernal machines, Lieutenant Fay of

iDr. von Bethmapn-Hollwegg, the imperial chancellor, undoubtedly will

GERMAN REPLY TO NOTE
IS HANDED AMBASSADOR
SITUATION STILL GRAVE
FIVE CENTS
Washington Waiting.
Washington, May 4.—Germany's re­
ply to the demands of the Unitcid
States for immediate abandonment of
present methods of submarine war­
fare, delivered .to Ambassador Gerard
today, was awaited by officials of the
Washington government tonight wiUi
expectant attention. They were with­
out any idea of the contents of tftd
communication. A brief message
from Ambassador Gerard, as well as
press reports, have created the im­
pression that the imperial govern­
ment would propose conditions whidh.
the United States could not accept.
It was reiterated that the president
stood unalterably by the demands in
the note, that abandonment of the
present submarine policy must be de­
clared and effected immediately. This
demand was designed to permit of
110
arguments and how qfftcials re­
peatedly have asserted that anything
short of a literal compliance .would
be followed by a diplomatic rupture.
The official copy of the note hardly
will reach Washington before tomor­
row night, but the document was fiV
en to the press in Berlin late tonight
and the official text was expected to
reach the United States tomorrow
morning.
Text'Not Clear,
Ambassador Gerard's message was
sent before he had examined the note
itself, Its meaning was not entirely
clear because of errors in transmis­
sion of the diplomatic cipher.
Secretary Lansing declined to com­
ment 011 the message or make it pub­
lic, for he feared it was garbled, or
that. Mr. Gerard, not having seen the
note itself, might have made inaccu­
rate deductions.. Furthermore, the
ambassador had indicated that his
iepublicar, victory in the general dec- regarded as being
tion. There is pmrng republicans ol
all types an eur^st effort to" set to­
gether, and he believes the coming re
publican convention will be a real get
together affair. With delegates will
satisfied with the choice of candidate
and with methods employed in making
such choice.
As to the German-American situa­
tion, Senator McCumber anticipates a
satisfactory agreement between this
country and the central empire. This
agreement is likely to be based on
Secretary Lansing's statement to the
press, that submarine boats must fol­
low the same warfare rules that are
followed by battle cruisers, rather
than complete abandonment of the
boat' campaign. Wilson's message to
congress and his note to Germany
failed to afford Germany an opportun­
ity to determine just what the United
States demanded, said Mr. McCumber,
maintaining that the note was without
point so far as any actual demand is
concerned. Eastern newspaper writers
soon discovered this and thai fact was
responsible for Secretary Lansing's
statement.
Maintain Position.
The position of the United States
is that merchant ships have a right
to arm themselves for defensive pur­
poses and so long as armament was
carried and used for defensive pur­
poses, the ship should receive "the
same treatment as other peaceful
trading snips. This position was re­
stated and elaborated upon in a mem­
orandum on the subject prepared tiy
Secretary 'Lansing, at the direction of
President Wilson, and only'a few days
after the dispatch of the hote to Ger­
many, sent to the governments of
Europe, neutrals as well as bellicer
ents.
Some officials tonight found a hope
ful indication in a press dispatch
which stated that considerable per­
turbation was apparent in Berlin over
the effect which "concessions" to .be
made might have on German public
opinion.
President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing prepared to remain up late
tonight, to see the unofficial text of
the reply carried in press dispatches,
but abandoned the idea, when it be­
came known that the dispatches
would not be available before morn­
ing. A special corps of operators was
kept on duty at the state department
to receive the official text, though at
midnight word had not come from
Ambassador Gerard that he was ready
to start the document.
Bernstorff Is Silent.
New York, May 4.—Count TOB Bern*
storff, the German ambassador, who is
here with his secretary, denied him­
self to interviewers tonisht. How­
ever, his secretary said he ^d
not
lieve the ambassador had been ippris
ed of the contents of the new
note. The ambassador, it
probablv would return to-Wa
tomorrow. j.

Secretary Lansing sent the dispatch
to the White House for the informa­
tion of President Wilson. At the same
time, an effort was made to have the
errors of transmission corrected. It
appeared tonifcht, however, that the
contents of the note would be known
before the corrections could be made.
Officials gave especial attention to
press dispatches, saying that the Ger­
man chancellor would have the Ger­
man public behind him in order to
avoid a break with the United States
"so far as can be done- without sac­
rificing the principle entfheiated in
the German manifesto of February 8."
