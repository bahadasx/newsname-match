are Entitled to Credit for Spectacu
lar Production — Greatest Event in
History of Schools.
Nearly one thousand children
danced and drilled in fantastic color
ful costumes for the largest crowd that
ever gathered to witness a school
event in Caldwell last Friday after
noon. The program was unmarred by
delay or accident, and every event
passed off with a snap and precision
which marked the carefully laid plans
of the teachers and those who had
supervision of the performance
Parade Delights Throngs.
The afternoon festivities were com
menced by the largest parable of its
sort that Caldwell has yet enjoyed.
Daintily decorated cars carried the
performers, who were costumed in
robes of many tints and styles. In
dian warriors of the olden times were
again seen riding through this terri
tory, and they were followed by ranks
of Dutchmen, Chinamen, Russians,
Japanese and numerous other nation
alities.
Prizes Awarded for Decorated Autos.
The first prize awarded for the best
decorated automobile went to Miss
Wilma Sower, whose car was trimmed
in pale green and studded with pop
pies. ^ Miss Bicknell's pupils who were
clad in charming little red costumes
representing poppies rode with Miss
Sower.
Mrs. Edna Boone won the second
prize. Her car was known as the rose
car and elicited a great deal of admir
ation as it passed the throngs of
spectators.
Pageant Opens Program.
The program was opened by the
pageant which was written by Miss
Anne Burns, of the High School Eng
lish department, in honor of the dedi
cation of the marker which the Daugh
ters of the American Revolution were
to unveil. The performance was a de
light to all who were able to see it.
Miss Marguerite Scott presided, as
Columbia, over the States. Then there
were maidens who did Unique and
graceful dances, which brought forth
exclamations from the spectators. The
Beauty Dance, which was adapted
and designed by Miss Huff, the High
School gymnasium teacher, brought
forth much favorable comment. The
Dance of the Hours prepared by Miss
Scott was another that attracted much
attention.
At the sound of "Taps" sung by Mr.
Arthur Binford, the state militia ap
peared on the scene. They were to
represent "the end of conquest," and
the coming of peace and after a shbrt,
snappy drill they turned with the en
tire company of performers to honor
the flag which slowlv rose above them
all during the singing of the Star
Spangled Banner.
Revelation to Spectators.
Revelation to Spectators.
Upon a signal, which was under
stood by hundreds of little folks in
columns, the courthouse green was
transformed into a rollicking seething
mass of children dancing and drilling,
all in different groups, representing
the industries of Idaho, The "Cow
Punchers" delighted the audience in
this drill. Another signal sounded and
at once the lawn was cleared, and
another group in the miscellaneous
drills took their places with a pre
cision that showed a thorough under
standing of exactlv what was expect
ed. In this drill set were the "Pop
pies", which delighted all who were
able to sec them. Upon request they
repeated their drill in the next set.
The Boy Scouts brought forth con
siderable favorable comment. The
Nationalities followed at once and
this set was the event of the after
noon. The little Highlanders in their
Highland Fling pleased everybody.
8torm Cuts Mav Pole Dance Short.
The May Pole dance was cut short
by the Storni which broke at 3:25 and
the thousands of spectators were sent
scurrying for shelter, before the pro
gram was completed.
Teachers Deterve All the Credit.
The grade teachers alone designed
and planned their own drills. They
worked hard and secured the results
that pleased everybody in the com
munity. They followed the plans that
were given them so carefully that the
drills, which were never rehearsed in
a mass, were put on all at one time as
if it had been done many times in
practice. „ .

Unveiling Program Marred.
The Daughters of the American
Revoluton had made extensive plans
for accomodating a large crowd at
their unveiling exercises at the ceme
tery, but the breakine of a severe wind
storm prevented all but a small gath
ering from attending this part of the
afternoon program.
Exercises Very Impressive.
The little groun that braved the
storm gathered at the s ' ,e J te . r 1 no" se
where the exercises were held. Mr.
E. H. Plowhead was master of cere
monies and after the invocation by
Rev. W. S. Hawkes, State Chaplain of
Sons of American Revolution, Miss
t ue . Adams, Regent of local chapter
1J. A. R., presented the granite marker
to the city of Caldwell in a speech
which was very fitting to the occas
Ma y° r Ered Boyes in a short
address accepted the marker for the
c 'ty. The address of the afternoon
was delivered by Mr. O. M. Van Duyn,
who depicted in choice words the life'
of those who traversed the Old Ore
K° n Trail. He detailed the history of
t|j e Trail and paid glowing tribute to
the pioneers who have ever since im
bued the northwest with a spirit of
undying perserverence. This part of
the program was closed with the
benedicition by Rev. Ewing.
Marker Unveiled by Children.
The marker was unveiled by the
children of the members of the local
n hapt c r D " A R ; While , a squad of
Boy Scouts stood at attention the flag
slowly slipped from the granite seat
and revealed the marker which will
speak to future generations of <
reverence for the pioneer.
A bevy of little children silently
passed before the seat, each leaving a
small spray of apple blossoms as a
silent tribute to those who had pass
ed beyond the horizon where the old
trail was lost to view.
Movies Of All Exercises.
A moving picture man was present
at all of the exercises of the day. The
pictures which he secured will be
shown in Caldwell at an early date.
STATE LAND BRINGS TOP
PRICE AT SALE SATURDAY
Approximately 4200 Acres of Land
Sold at Good Prices.
The sale of state land in Caldwell
Saturday was a great success. The
bidding was lively. Good prices were
obtained. In only one or two in
stances were tracts sold for as little as
the appraised value.
Approximately 4200 acres of land
were sold at auction. Prices of $80,000
and $83.00 per acre were realized for
two tracts. Commissioner George A
Day, who conducted the sale was
greatly pleased with the results ob
tained. The record at the February
sale was $85.00 per acre.
Only slightly more than half of the
lands listed this time were disposed of
at this sale. The average price ap
proximatel $25 to $27: Unlike the
other sale there was a conspicuous
absence of values in the $40, $50 and
$60 classes.
Held at City Hall.
As the courtroom at the county
building was in use, • permission was
secured to hold the sale in the audi
torium of the city hall. This change
caused a slight delay in starting the
sale, the bidding beginning about
10:45. It was after 12:30 before the
last tract on the list had been offered,
Attendance at the sale was large t
but the crowd dwindled to about 50
spectators and bidders near the close.
Bidding was spirited at times and at
othen times lagged perceptibly.
The tracts which brought the fancy
prices are located about three and
four miles south of Parma and south
west of Notus.
STANFIELD PAYS LARGE
FORTUNE FOR SHEEP
Eastern Oregon Finançier Took Over
Extensive Holdings of McLeod
ft Hodgson.
It became known here Saturday
that one of the largest realty deals
ever pulled off in this section of the
state is now being consummated.
Robert N. Stanfield, the eastern Ore
gon sheep king, is taking over the en
tire holdings of McLeod & Hodgson
in Owyhee county. These include 1,
260 acres of land, 15,000 head of ewes,
11,000 head of lambs and a leasehold
of approximated- 1200 acres of land.
Colin McLeod, one of the partners
who are making the sale, admitted
Saturday afternoon that the contract
tor this big deal had been signed and
(hat counting of the sheep had just
been accomplished. He also stated
that Mr. Stanfield was expected to
arrive Saturday evening or Monday to
consummate the transaction.
Fortune Involved.
Rumor fixed the value of the prop
erty which is changing hands at $185,
000. When this was called to Mr
McLeod's attention, he modestly
stated that the figure is too large, but
declined to give the correct consider
ation. That it approximates $150,000
is generally figured out.
Owyhee Holdings Only.
Mr. McLeod corroborated the fact
that only the Owyhee holdings of his
'"firm are involved in the transfer.
McLeod and Hodgson retain their
ranch lands in Boise county and the
4800 sheep which are grazing there
on. They a. sc , own.large-umbers of
cattle and horses in both
which are not included.
Harvey G- Morgan died at Boise
Tuesday, aged 69 years. Mr. Morgan
underwent an operation for gallstones
some time ago and never fullv recov
ered. Mr. Morgan was born in New
York. He came to Caldwell some
years ago and has been engaged in
the furniture, furniture repair, and
second-hand business. He leaves no
relatives in this section. There is
thought to be a brother living in the
East. The funeral was held from the
Jones Undertaking parlors Tuesday.
The services were conducted by the
Rev. J. G. Cowden.
Katherina Parris has filed suit for
divorce against Constantine Parris.
The papers wei'e immediately with

WHITE ELEPHANT FOR
C00NÏÏ OFFICERS
BOARD OF COUNTY COMMIS
SIONERS PASS RESOLUTION
TO HOLD PUBLIC HEAR
ING ON RESULT OF
AUDIT.
AN DEUSEN BEPORT IS
Already Investigation Shows that Ex
pert Made Many Serious Mistakes—
County -Board Does Not Care ot
Shoulder Responsibility and l'asses
it Up—Hearing Set for June 5 when
Everybody Will have Chance to Ex
press Thoughts on Audit.
.The Van Deusen report seems to be
a white elephant on the hands of the
county commissioners. After months
of patient waiting they finally got the
report. Now they do not know what
to do with it.
Wednesday the board of county
commissioners met for the purpose of
massing on the report. They decided
sy resolution not to accept the report
at the present time but fixed June 5th
as the date when a public hearing will
be held. All former county officials
will be given an opportunity to express
their opinion on the report of the Van
Deusen audit.
Date of Hearing Fixed.
In order to pass up the responsibili
ty of accepting the report the board
of county commissioners passed the
following resolution Wednesday;
"In the matter of the report of Clar
ence Van Deusen, special auditor of
the books and accounts of Canyon
county for the years 1907-1914, inclu
sive. it is ordered that on the 5th day
of June, 1916, 10 a. m., at the com
missioners' office in Caldwell, be the
time and place for consideration of
said report, and that the county clerk
cause notice to be served, either per
sonally or by registered letter, upon
each person, firm or corporation
shown by said report as owing money
to Canyon county, to appear on or be
fore said date and file objections in
writing (if any they have) why said
report should not be accepted, or if
said report be accepted as correct, to
pay to the county treasurer the sum
shown by said report to be due and
owng to Canyon county."
Errors in Report.
There are a number of grave errors
in the report. Former officials who are
accused of having failed to account for
all money received have been checking
up the report since its publication.
These officials have found numerous
errors. These errors have been point
ed out. In fact the errors are so nu
merous that the board of commission
ers do not care to accept the report
at the present time.
Objections to the report will be filed
by former county officials. These of
ficials will probably present their ob
jections at the public hearings to be
held June 5th.
OVER-IRRIGATION IS
MENACE T.O IDAHO
Adapted from Poster by the Utah Ag
ricultural College.
Over-irrigation i$ a menace to Idaho
because:
1. Smaller crop yields are obtained
for each unit of water used.
2. More plant food is taken up by
the plant for each pound of crop.
3. The Quality of the crops is great
ly reduced.
4. Straw is produced at the expense
of grain.
5. Plant food is washed out of th
soil.
6. Lower-lying lands become wa
ter-logged.
7. Other dry lands are cheated of
irrigation water.
8. The extension of the irrigated
acre is hindered. . .
9. A wholesome community spirit
is lowered wherever water is wasteful
ly used.
Idaho's future depends on the eco
nomical use of irrigation water.
Idaho's irrigated area can be doubled
by the more economical use of the wa
ter now taken out by our canals and
reservoirs.
Farmers! Take heed!
The Tribune is indebted to Judge J.
M. Thompson for the above—it is
worthy of being heralded wide and

The following letter from the First
Assistant Secretary of the Interior
dealing with residence upon lands un
der government reclamation projects
is of local interest. This is the deci
sion of the Department upon the ques
tion involved.
The letter from First Assistant Sec
retary Jones to the Reclamation Com
mission, dated April 19, holds that pri
vate landowners who have filed appli
cations for water rights for lands
within a government reclamation pro
ject are entitled to water right certifi
cates "upon proof of the cultivation
and reclamation of the land to which
the certificate applies."
The Letter in Full.
Mr. Jones' letter to the Reclamation
Service setting forth the conclusion of
the Department is as follows:
"I am in receipt of your letter of
Dec. 30, 1915, concerning the issuance
of a final certificate for water right to
Mr. Andrew Carrick, of Portland,
Oregon, for 20 acres of land in private
ownership in the Tieton unit of the
Yakima Reclamation project, Wash
ington.
"The question involved is whether
at date of submission of proof as a ba
sis of issuance of final certificate Mr.
Carrick must furnish evidence that he
is a resident upon the tract of land
involved or within the neighborhood
thereof. The reclamation act of June
17, 1902 (32 Stat.. 388), provided that
"No right to the use of water
for land in private ownership shall
be sold for a tract exceeding one
hundred and sixty acres to any one
landowner, and no such sale shall
be made to any landowner unless
he be an actual bona fide resident
on such land, or occupant thereof
residing in the neighborhood of
said land, and no such right shall
permanently attach until all pay
ments therefor are made."
The act further provided that the
payment of construction charges in
connection with such lands might be
made in ten annual instalments. _ Con
struing the above-quoted provision of
law, the Department held that resi
dence must be maintained upon the
land or in the neighborhood, the latter
being arbitrarily fixed at 50 miles, un
til he had completed the payment of
construction charges. August 9, 1912
(37 Stat., 265). Congress ^mended the
said reclamation act so as to provide
among other things, for the issuance
of patents and water-right certificates
upon the submission of certain proofs
as to residence, reclamation, and culti
vation. and of payments of all moneys
then due, each patent and water-right
certificate so issued to reserve to the
United States a prior lien on the land
patented or for which a water right
is certified. In other words. Congress
provided that a homestead entryman
or a private landowner within a rec
lamation project need not await the
completion of payment of all construc
tion charges before securing a patent
or a final water-right certificate, but
might obtain same at any time after
submitting the proof hereinafter in
dicated, the balance due being secured
by a lien in favor of the United States
"Private landowners who have filed ap
plications for water rights for their
lands within such a project, and whose
applications have been received and
filed, are described in the act of Aug
ust 9, 1912, as 'purchasers of water
right certificates' and the said act enti
tles them to a final water-right certi
ficate 'upon proof of the cultivation
and reclamation of the land to which
the certificate applies.'
Section 1 of the act of August 9,
1912. is as follows:
"That any homestead entryman
under the Act of June seventeenth,
nineteen hundred and two. known
as the reclamation Act, including
entrymen on ceded Indian lands,
may, at any time after having com
plied with the provisions of law
applicable to such lands as to res
idence, reclamation and cultiva
tion, submit proof of such resi
dence, reclamation and cultiva
tion, which proof, if found regular
and satisfactory, shall entitle the
entryman to a patent, and all pur
chasers of water-right certificates
on reclamation projects shall be
entitled to a final water-right cer
tificate upon proof of the cultiva
tion and reclamation of the land to
which the certificate applies, to the
extent required by the reclamation
Act for homestead entrymen:
Provided, That no such patent or
certificate shall issue until all sums
due the United States on account
of such land or water right .at the
time of issuance of patent or cer
tificate have been paid.
"It is therefore evident from a con
sideration of the two acts cited that
the owner of private land within a
reclamation project who desires to o!>- !
tain a water right under the project
must be a resident upon the land or in
the neighborhood at the time he pre
sents his application for a water right
and until said application is entertain
ed and approved by the United States:
but that upon such approval and ac
ceptance a sale of a water right to him
has been consummated, and that there
after he occupies the status of one
who has competed the purchase of a ]
water right and who is entitled to a!
final water-right certificate upon the i
proof specified in the act of August
9, 1912, without bein~ required to show
that he is then a resident upon the
land or that he lives in the neighbor
hood.
"The papers pertaining to the appli
cation of Mr. Carrick and other papers
transmitted therewith are herewith re
turned, and you will in the future ad
ministration of the reclamation laws
be governed by the holding herein
made.
"Very truly yours,
"ANDRIEUS A. JONES.
"First Assistant Secretary."
NAB ASSISTANT POSTMASTER
AT PAYETTE POSTOFFICE
Wm. N. Carstens Arrested, Charged
With Taking Check from Mail.
William N. Carstens, assistant post
master at Payette for the last 12 years
was arrested Saturday afternoon by
postoffice inspectors and charged with
taking checks from the mails.
Carstens is alleged to have made a
confession of guilt to the authorities.
He waived preliminary hearing and
gave bond of $1000 to appear before
the federal court at the September
term.
The arrest of Carstens came as a
shock to Payette people. The young
man, who is 28 years of age, was
raised in that city and has a wife and
one small child there. The bond was
signed by his father and father-in-law.
The charge of sending a spurious
check or checks through the mail, also

Portland, Ore., and Inspector H. E.
Ballard of Boise.
SHADE FIELD DIES
IN WEISER HOSPITAL
Slayer of Ward Brothers is Victim of
Intestinal Trouble.
Shade Field, the sheep camp tender
who shot and killed Edward and
Wayman Ward near Donnelly, Ida.,
last September, and who was later ac
quitted of the murder of Ed Ward on
the ground of self-defense, died in the
general hospital at Weiser on Tuesday
morning, following an operation for
intestinal trouble. His body was tak
en in charge by his brother and prob
ably will be shipped to his former
home in Tennessee for interment.
Field had been ill for several days.
At first, when it was thought he had
rheumatism, he was Drought to Weiser
for treatment. Later his ailment was
diagnosed as a more serious trouble,
and three skilled surgeons were called
to attend him. An operation was de
cided upon.
Found Not Guilty.
Field was tried in Canyon county
for the killing of Edward Ward,
change of venue from Boise county
having been obtained. After a long
and bitterly contested trial the jury
found him not guilty. Later the com
plaint against him for the shooting of
Wayman Ward was dismissed, the ev
idence in both cases being practically
identical.
It showed that the Wards had beat
en Palmer, a sheepherder whose camp
Field was tending, and were about to
"finish" him when Field threatened
them with a. pistoL/ Field claimed
they paid no attention to his threat
and in order to save Palmer's life he
shot both men.
Gets Change of Venue.
In the application for a change of
venue it was alleged that Field could
not obtain a fair trial in Boise county
on account of the prejudice existing
against him. The case was according
ly transferred to Canyon county and
tried before Judge Davis.
The prosecuting attorney of Boise
county asked Judge Davis to step
aside for the second trial, after Judge
Bryan had declined to trv the case.
Judge Davis declined, and the com
plaint was dismissed.
When Field was freed he was again
engaged by his former employer, in
whose service he was when he be
came ill.
Hon. J. M. Thompson, attorney for
the Black Canyon Irrigation district,
together with the Board of Directors
of the same organization, were in con
ference with the Reclamation officials
in Boise Wednesday. Thé outlook for
the district is very bright just now and
it is confidently expected that matters
of considerable importance will occur
in the near future.

RURAL HOME SURVEY
WILL BE MADE BY
CANYON IS FIRST COUNTY IN
IDAHO AND THIRD IN UNIT
ED STATES TO BE SUR
VEYED IN THIS MAN
NER.
Department of Agriculture and Uni
versity of Idaho Co-operate—Miss
Gertrude McCheyne and Miss
Hooper Will Have Charge of Survey
of Homes—First Public Meeting
will be at Sunny Slope Tuesday May
9th, Afternoon and Evening.
The Agricultural Extension Depart
ment of the University of Idaho and
the U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, have
selected Canyon county in which to
make a rural home survey. The rea
sons for the choice are that Canyon
county has a well-organized agricul
tural system, and a county agricul
turist. The community centers are as
thoroughly organized as any in the
state and therefore this county is
chosen as a suitable and representative
county in which to carry out the same
plan of procedure as was represented
in Utah last year by Miss Gertrude
McCheyne. Miss McChttyene held
Community meetings and also gave
home demonstrations for the purpose
"of securing the adoption of more ef
ficient methods in home management
and to gain knowledge by observation
of methods already in use." Miss Mc
Cheyne's work established beyond a
doubt that in Utah at least there is a
big field for helpful, co-operative de
monstration work among farm women
and because of the remarkably good
results obtained, the U. S. Dept. of
Agriculture has decided to give the
work a further trial.
The work here is co-operatively un
der the supervision of the Agricultural
Extension Department of the Univer
sity of Idaho and the U. S. Dept. of
Agriculture, and Miss Jessie M.
Hoover, professor of home economics,
U. of C. has been chosen to present
these demonstrations and is already
in the county perfecting plans for a
two months' campaign. The U. S.
Dept. of Agriculture has realized that
the greatest success on the farm can
only be attained by having the
farm home as convenient and at
tractive as the town home. The
principal objects of the work are,
first, to find out if women are
contented with present farm con
ditions, second, to assemble sugges
tions from the experience of Canyon
county women and others that will be
helpful to the various communities
and individuals; third, to suggest and
demonstrate ways and means of light
ening household labor in order to give
more time for rest and improvement.
Among the plans for procedure Miss
Hoover proposes to present such
things as are suited to the individaul
communities as for example, the
home-made fireless cooker, and its
use; inexpensive labor saving devices;
practical methods of preserving vege
tables and meals; accurate methods
for making jelly; the daily schedule of
work; keeping business records for
the home; laundry and cleaning sug
gestions; evening entertainment in
the home. She is extremely anxious
to have the housewives present their
problems in order that all may profit
by a mutual exchange of ideas.
County Agent, McCall, of the
Agricultural Extension Department of
the University of Idaho, is rendering
assistance in every way possible. Miss
Hoover will be accompanied by Miss
Z. Fay Fowler, county superintend
ent, whenever time and opportunity
permits.
The first meeting will be held next
The first meeting will be held next
Tuesday, May 9th, at Sunny Slope.
This is in response to the invitation
and interest of the bunny Slope com
munity. The afternoon meeting will
begin at 2:30 and close at 4:30. The
evening meeting will be held at eight
o'clock and it is hoped that all the
families of the community will attend.
Both of these meetings will be held
at the school house. At the evening
meeting County Superintendent Fow
ler, Miss Hoover, and County Agent,
McCall, will speak.
Following the community meeting
Miss Fowler and Miss Hoover will
visit such homes as arc open for dem
onstrations.
