"MAYOR" DENNIS
STEUBENRAUCH
OF HAARIG, DEAD
Daughter in Cape Gets Word
of Sudden Death in
St. Louis.
HIS PLACE WAS KNOWN
IN 200-MILE RADIUS
Body Probably Will be Brought
to Cape for Burial
Sister Here.
Dennis Steubcnrauch, whose saloon
in Haarig years ago was known for
a distance of 200 miles around, died
suddenly in St. Louis yesterday, ac
cording to word received in the Cape
yesterday afternoon by his daughter,
Mrs. Annie Hagen.
The message, leceived by telegraph,
was very brief and meager concern
ing the facts. Arrangements for the
funeral had not been made last night,
but Mr. Steubenrauch's relatives and
friends plan to have the body brought
to the Cape for burial.
.Mr. Steubenrauch was probably the
best known man in Haarig for many
years and his place became historic.
He conducted his saloon in the build
ing now occupied by the Cofer cloth
ing store.
He has been gone from the Cape
for about six years and until recently,
his friends believed, he has lived be
tween Cairo and Memphis. When he
went to St. Louis and the circum
stances of his residence there were
unknown in the Cape last night.
Mr. Steubenrauch al o has a sister
living here, Mrs. John Metz, who re
sides in the Houck addition in the
southwestern part of the city. Mrs.
Hagen, his daughter, resides at the
Metz home.
, A brother, Joseph Steubenrauch, i?
living in the lower counties some
where, and his former wife now is
Mrs. Louis Beaudien.
Mr. Steubenrauch was about 50
years old and was born in Scott
County. His father, George Steuben
rauch, emigrated to this country from
Germany in the early pioneer days.
Dennis came to the Cape when he was
a young man and until the time that
he left here some years ago, he lived
most of his life in this city.
He moved away from here after he
had been divorced from his first wife,
and a daughter, Geraldine Steuben
rauch, accompanied him, while his
other daughter and a sister remained.
According to friends who have been
in communication with him since his
removal from the Cape, Steubenrauch
obtained a position upon a large dairy
farm between Cairo and Memphis. He
subsequently married the woman who
owned the farm, it is said.
Steubenrauch was a brother-in-law,
through his first wife, to John Tony
and Joseph Job.
MRS. LOROERG HAS OPERATION.
Surgeons Work for Two and One-Half
Hours at Hospital.
Mrs. Flora Lorbcrg, wife of Martin
Lorberg, of 433 South Sprigg street,
proprietor of the Haarig Furniture
Company, yesterday morning under
went an operation at St. Francis hos
pital after an illness of about six
months.
Mrs. Lorberg has been suffering
with nervousness for some time and
within the last few weeks she has
been considered on the verge of nerv
ous breakdown, according to her phy
sicians. She was taken to the hospital
and went upon the operating table at
8 o'clock yesterday morning. The
surgeons worked for two and a half
hours before they completed their
work. Her condition last night was
reported to be good.

CAR SHORTAGE
CAUSES PLANTS
TO CLOSE DOWN
Production of Cape Factories
Is Curtailed by Lack
of Cars.
SOUTHERN LUMBER
MILLS HIT HARD
Frisco Concentrating Refrigera
tor Cars Around
Springfield.
A stortage in the supply of railroad
freight cars that has become appar
ent in the East and Middle West, as
well as South, and has received the
attentiqn of traffic experts of nearly
every railroad, for several weeks has
made itself felt upon Cape Girardeau
manufacturing concerns doing heavy
shipping out of the Cape.
The shortage has assumed such
proportions that it threatens, in some
instances, to curtail production, and in
Louisiana, reports have been received
in the Cape, many lumber mills have
been closed down entirely on account
of the lack of cars with which to
handle the output.
In this city one of the largest ship
ping concerns, the Cement plant, has
been unable to fill some of its orders
on account of the inability to get cars.
About half the number of cars that
the Cement plant asks of the Frisco
daily has been furnished, and about
two weeks ago the proportion was less
than half.
Other shipping companies are af
fected in the same way, many of them
receiving less consideration at the
hands of the traffic men than the
cement plant.
The cement plant has asked for
from 12 to 15 cars a day, but has
received only 6 and S. The supply
was curtailed up until two weeks ago,
when the officials of the plant showed
the Frisco officials that each car sent
to the cement plant was staying there
an average of 20 hours, whereas under
the per diem rules the plant would be
allowed to hold the car 48 hours be
fore demurrage started.
Following this exhibition the cement
plant has been able to get more cars.
The car shortage this spring is
caused by many different traffic situ
ations. The .shortage in the Louisiana.
Mississippi and Tennessee lumbering
districts is caused by an absence of
cars in New Orleans that have been
sent there loaded with products to be
exported aboard ship from that city.
In that way the war situation ha?
aided in causing a car shortage in
that district. Under normal shipping
conditions many cars are sent loaded
with foreign cargoes to New Orleans.
The moment they are unloaded at the
steamship docks they are available for
northbound tarffic and are sent to the
lumber mills in the adjacent states
for loading.
This exportation has been cut off,
with the result that the cars are not
reaching that section of the country
in the numbers that they used to
move. A shut-down in many lumber
mills has been the result.
In Missouri the Frisco railroad is
concentrating refrigerator cars around
Springfield in preparation for berry
shipmerts. The refrigerator cars
have been used for shipping various
kinds of merchandise besides food
stuffs. Building activity in Southeast Mis
souri and likewise in Arkansas and
Louisiana has increased the demand
for cars here for shipping building ma
terials. In Southeast Missouri alone
eight concrete grain elevators are in
course of construction, demanding in
the aggregate considerable tonnage in
building materials.

MAYOR GETS TWO
SQUIRRELSFOR ZOO
Executive Will Move Animals to
Park Soon to Buy Pair
Geese.
Two tame squirrels housed in a large
woven wire cage have been presented
to the city for the Zoo that is being
organized in Fairgrounds park. May
or Kage, who has been made park
commissioner by the City Council, last
night declared that he expects to
move the two animals from their
present home to the park within a few
days.
The squirrels have been donated to
the zoo by Linus (Jalliher, who resides
in the Red Star addition. Mr. (Jalli
her is a traveling salesman and he
acquired the squirrels on one of his
trips some time ago.
He is an animal fancier and took
them to his home where he had a
large squirrel cage constructed and
undertook to keep them as pots. Aft
er having taken care of them for a
while, however, he became tired of the
work connected with their upkeep and
recently told the Mayor that he would
be glad to turn the animals over to
the city as soon as the city officials,
are ready to receive them and accord
them proper care.
A large supply of walnuts also will
be turned over to the city by Mr. (Jal
liher as food for the squirrels.
The Mayor last night also announc
ed that he has been promised two
hares by some person who called him
up by telephone and whose identity he
did not learn. He expects to take care
of these as soon as permissible.
Mr. (Jalliher will co-operate with
the Mayor in obtaining some geese
which will be installed at the City park
lake. Mr. Galliher declared that he
can obtain a pair from a farmer liv
in' on the other side of Allenville and
the next time that he makes a trip in
that vicinity he expects to bring home
the geese for the park.
The Mayor declared he wants wild
geese for the lake to take the place
of swans, which have been unavail
able. The geese will do about as well
until the swans are furnished My Her
man Loeffel, who promised to obtain
them at the time the park bond cam
paign was being conducted.
Negotiations still are pending at
Kennett in regard to the acquisition
of the two deer for the zoo, and before
they are brought to the city a place
will have to be fenced off for them.
Promises of many other animals
have been made to Mayor Kage with
in the last few weeks, and it is esti
mated that when once the park is in
condition to accommodate the various
animals, there will be several on hand
for entrance.

KAGE WILL PITCH
FIRST BALL SUNDAY
Executive Plans a "Spitter" for
Initial Portageville
Batsman.
Mayor Kage on Sunday afternoon
will open the Capaha baseball season
at Fairgrounds park by pitching the
first ball, offering the pellet to the
I initial Portageville batsman with all
the skill, dexterity, speed and "Eng-
lish" that
an executive may put
upon it.
As a consequence, the Capahas are
confidently looking forward to a
"strike" on the part of the opposing
batter.
Not since the first ball of the open
ing game last spring has the Mayor
entered the "box" to spring his cross-
I fire delivery upon a dazed big-stick
artist. Uut the Mayor keeps in trim
for an emergency and last night prom
ised Joe Barenkamp, manager of the
Capahas, that he will "put 'er over
the pan."
"However, I'll be candid with you
and say that I probably could do you
more good if I were to take the lead
in a horse-shoe pitching contest than
mere baseball. It would be like old
times to pitch a ringer.
"We never used to play baseball
much when I was a boy. We were
too busy hunting or fishing, or work
ing, and once in a while we could get
up a game of horse-shoes out behind
the bam."
A large crowd is expected to attend
the initial game of the Capahas' sea
son in the Southeast Missouri league,
which opens with Portageville. C'
renkamp has lost one or two of his
prospective players to the Portageville
team, and according to advance dope,
the visitors will have an aggregation
of real baseball players along when
they come to the Cape.
Portageville is a new team in the
league and will fight hard to make an
excellent showing at the outset. The
Capahas now have a nine that is play
ing as if the men had had a southern
training trip.
Since the announcement of the
schedule of games for the local team,
enthusiastic followers of the Cape
aggregation have voiced considerable
dissatisfaction with the arrangement
that was meted out to the Cape.
By reason of the fact that the Cape
is one of the largest cities in the
league and that baseball crowds large
enough to make the game a paying
proposition are drawn to the park, the
Cape rooters contend that the Capa
has should have been slated for games
on the home ground two out of every
three games scheduled.
The schedule splits the Capahas'
time fifty-fifty between the Cape and
outside places, so that the team is
put to heavy traveling expense. In a
majority of the towns where the ont-

FINDS FRACTURE
MADE WEEK AGO
Otto Harris Suffers Blow on Arm
and Learns He Has
A Break.
After carrying a broken arm for a
week and wondering what was the
cause of the pain whith eminated from
the fracture, Otto Harris yesterday
afternoon went to a physician's office
to have his arm diagnosed and like
wise repaired.
Harris is an employe of the Cape
Cooperage plant and about a week ago
while at work he received a hard blow
upon the right arm above the wrist
from n part of a machine with which
he was working.
The blow gave considerable pain, but
within a few hours the pain was
assuaged and he continued working.
The next morning his arm still direct
ed Mr. Harris' attention to the fact
that he had been delivered a wailop
above the wrist. He tried to work the
soreness out by rubbing and applying
home remedies.
The arm began to swell and for
three days Harris was hindered con
siderably while at work. Yesterday
morning the pain was severe and the
swelling increased. He thought his
arm must have been fractured by the
blow which he had received a week
ago. When he got to the doctor's of
fice he learned that his own diagnosis
was correct and the physician who
spliced the bones together said that
the fracture was in a serious condi
tion on account of having gone such a
long time before receiving attention.

White House tonight to go over the
situation with the Kxecutive.
Ambassador Gerard is said to have

tinue to make successes.
Loss of ground southwest of Dead
Man Hill is admitted by Berlin in the
night report. The German statement,
however, contends that the French at
tacks on the slopes to the west were
repulsed. A report reached. London

SPANS TO COST
$90,000 ARE TO
BE NEEDED SOON
Judge Hays Tells Court
County Will Take an Ap
peal in Case.
RANNEY DECISION
IS NOW SET ASIDE
Dead Jurist Held People Should
Not Bear Burden of
Drainage Co.
Judge Frank P. Kelly in the Circuit
Court at Jackson yesterday announced
orally that he had decided the County
would have to bridge the county roads
whore the Little River Drainage Dis
trict cuts its channel through them.
His opinion wil' not become effec
tive until tomorrow, wlrm he announc
ed he would render his decision in
writing. This verdict will save the
Harrison-Himmelberger interests an
expenditure of $100,000, if Judge Kel
ly's decision is sustained by the Su
preme Court, where it will be taken
upon an appeal by the attorneys for
he County.
Judge Edward D. Hays, chief coun
sel for the County, made an appeal to
the court, asking that his judgment
for the Drainage District be suspend
ed pending the result of the County's
appeal. Judge Kelly did not finally
pass upon this request, but it is quit
likely th't his written decision will
dispose of it.
"With all due respect to the court's
opinion," began Judge Hays, "the at
torneys for the County still believe
their cause is just and will ask for an
appeal to the Supreme Court.
"Under the general procedure of
law, the decision of a circuit court in
an injunction suit must prevail until
the case is decided in the Supreme
Court. As soon as the Drainage Dis
trict learns of your decision in favor
of the district, I feel they will proceed
to mutilate the highways and do the
County an irreparable damage and
one whicli could not be restored even
should the present decision be re
versed. "In the case of the State vs. Deer
ing, Missouri Reports ISO, page T.?,
the law provides where a circuit judge
dissolves an injunction and decree of
dissolution the judgment is final, yet
if he believes that the plaintiff in the
case would .suffer damage that could
not be restored by the vindication of
the plaintiff's contention in appeal,
the court has the right to make an
order thai the final judgment of dis
solution of the injunction shall be sus
pended pending the appeal."
Judge Hays asked Judge Kelly to
make this order, and the court inti
mated that the request might be
granted, but if it was it would not
apply to the Zalma-Allenville road,
which point has been reached by the
drainage crew. This road will be sev
ered probably tomorrow afternoon or
Sunday.
Judge Kelly told the attorneys that
while he did not believe the law was
fair to the people, he could not favor
the County in the case, because the
statutes were against the County's
contention.
The court's verdict was a big vic
tory for the Little River Drainage
District. According to Highway En
gineer Scivally, it represents an ex
penditure of $00,000 to the tax payers
of the County. Roads that are cut
by the drainage people cannot be
permanently bridged until the voters
of the County have passed a bond
issue appropriating the money. The
