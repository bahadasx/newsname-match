ON FOREIGN POLICY
Recent Developments in Ger
man Situation Have Not
Changed His View.
NOTHING IS FINAL"
Better That , Negotiations
Should Continue Between
Friends, He Says.
Recent developments in the German
Mtu.il ii have not changed the atti
tude of William Jennings Roan. He
still believes that nothing is final be
tvvcen friends
' I do not care to make a predic
tion " said Mr Hrjan this morning.
I hae confined mjself to an ex
pression of hope. I hope the situa
tion will end satisfactorily, but if not
I hope there will be no break in dip
lomatic relations. It Is better that
negotiations continue on the princi
ple that nothing is final between
friends "
Mr Hrjan did not hae much to
sav about national politics. He said
there was no doubt about the renomi
lution of President Wilson.
"The political situation is some
what complicated," he continued, ''by
the fact that wo do not Know how
completelj the Hepublican party will
be reunited Our success four jears
a no was due to the division in the
part j and our chances this jcar will
be ni.itcri.ill bettered if the Republi
cans put up two candidates."
Mr Hrjan began speaking in the
I'mversitj Auditorium at 11 a. m.
The hall was packed.
Mr Iir.m contrasted the city daily
newspaper with the country weekly.
A w riter for a city daily," he con
tinued, "often has to write what he
does not bolide He has to write
often what ho really does not feel.
The country editor who owns his pa
per writes what ho reallj thinks and
is personalis responsible for what he
writes The countrj editor is like the
watihman in the tower. He sees the
beginning of eil and warns the peo
ple. "The large citj papers are great
institutions and need large capital.
These men who have the capital to fi
nance the city daily papers are men
who have no intimate sjmpathy for
the masses "
Mr. Hrjan received great applause.
The crowd was so large that many
had to be turned away from the Audi

Missouri Press ssociation Sets Dale
Hears Informal Talk.
An informal meeting of the Mis

daj 's Journalism Week program. J.

September 11. 13. 1C as the dates and
Kansas Cit as the place for the fif
tieth annual meeting of the associa
tion Harrj Donman, editor of the Farm
ington (Mo) News spoke on "The
Equipment for the Country Printing
Office "
"The average country printer," said
Mr Denman. "is cither working with
worn-out. Inadequate material, or else
he spends money foolishly for equip
ment he does not need. The equip
ment of a country printing office
should be ample lo serve all the ordi
narj and emergency needs. Every
thing should be in first class condi
tion Don't get too ambitious, but
don't be lion-progressive. Know jour
field better than jou knew the multi
plication table when a boy and jou
will succeed"
i: X Meador of Cassville. Rich P.
Correll of Clark and P. H. Harris of
Verona, who were scheduled to speak
on "Kditorial or Xews in the Country
Paper" were unable to be present, and
volunteers were called for.
II J Wanton of the Paris Appeal
was the first to speak.
"When it comes down to the point
or news or editorials, throw the edi
tor! it down the back steps and print
the news," he said. "Write jour edi
torials and hang them on the hook to
he ued if jou have a hole to fill up.
I don't mean to say that a paper
should not use editorials. At times
thej are absolutely necessary. But
thej should not be used in preference
to news. That is what the people take
a country paper for to get the news
f the surrounding territory."

That Simeon R. Llojd, who died in

Elma U. Llojd of Columbia, the widow
of Thomas Llojd. nephew of Simeon;
against her daughter Pearl and their
immediate relatives, five of whom are

of Columbia. It Is filed by twenty
five children of Mr. Llojdjs four de
ceased brothers and sister.
The will was made October 13. 101".

E, W, HOWE, KAON,
TELLS 0RAT0RS
Philosopher in Lecture Gives
Away the Pet Secrets of
the Noble Art.
SHOWS WHY HE QUIT
Ambition to Have His Name
Written in Full Caused
His Retirement.
"Old Ed" Howe of Atchison, Kan,
humorist and philosopher, "Sage of
Potato Hill" and globe-trotter, who
quit the newspaper game because he
want d to wipe out his past and be
come known to the world as Edgar
Watson Hone, thereby attaining a
euphonious dignitj enjojed bj Wil
liam Allen White, James Lane Allen
and other notable seniles, announced
his subject as "Glue and Molasses
Rollers," at the Universitj Auditorium
last night.
Mr. Howe said that he had long
been interested in the studj of the
rise and fall of oratoij-. Who invited
it? Who originated the ldta that peo
ple liked it?
"Many a promising social aflair has
been broken up bj' the orator," said
Mr. Howe.
"Yawning, that's ..nat makes public
speaking so bad The sleeping man
indicates a tired nnn, but the jawner
well, he's not disgraceful but he's
not quite gentle.
Morj of a I. renin Course.
"One time I started out to inves
tigate a Ijceum course given in our
town. I wanted to find out who had
started the idea that we wanted it
No one would claim it. According to
testimony nobodj wanted it. It lmal-Ij-
developed that a Ijceum agent had
gumshoed into town and convinced
the leading citizens that it was a good
thing and that they should guarantee
the expenses, and these gentlemen,
having been stuck, pr ceded to stick
the rest of us.
"I have noticfd that all orators in
troduce an anecdote -tell a storj to
gtt people in a good humor, with a
view, sometimes, to passing the plate.
I'm not going to tell jou anj stories,
because jou live in a univrsitj com
munity and see the almanacs before
I do"
Mr .Howe said that many newspa
per men reminded him of a German
American major who had been born
in Swabia. Xow p ople from Swabia
land do not alwajs develop enough
brains for everjday use. There is a
very critical time in their career, the
age of 40, when thej suddenly burst
into full How r, or their hopes are
gone forever. This major from Swabia
land was given a gold-headed cane by
his constituent, but being a very
small, squat person, he found that it
was too tall, so he cut off the head.
When he was asked why lis. didn't cut
it off below he said, "Well, it's all
right down there."
Other People of the Same Sort.
That was the method, Mr. Howe
said, followed by the papers and the
people who attacked the big business
men of the nation but objected to
nothing so long as it was done by the
proletariat
Speaking of newspapers, Mr. Howe
said he was tired of hearing newspa
per men refer to the Fourth Eestate;
that in his estimation theirs was the
lirst estate, and that thej- were daily
growing bigger, stronger and more
forceful.
Mr. Howe has had some unusual
ambitions. One of them was to get
$100 for a circus ad. He never real
ized it. Another one was to be able
to write what he thought on anj sub
ject under h aven. Se he quit his
newspaier and published "Ed Howe's
Monthlj," and he doesn't take a line of
advertising and he's got more sub
scribers than ho wants So he writes
what he thinks.
RIMTSSES THE STEPHENS RILL
J. II. Moorehead of Kansas City,
secretary of the Southwestern Lum
bermen's Association, spoke a few
minutes todaj on the merits of the
Stephens Hill which is now before
Congress This bill would make it un
lawful for the big retailers to take
a nationally advertised article, for
instance an Ingersoll watch, and sell
it for less than the advertised price.
The Stephens bill law is designed
to protect the small retailer. Mr.
Moorehead said the big retailers ad
vertised an article at half price for
a day to get people into their stores
in order to sell them other goods at
high prices.
"BEST-EVER" PARADE
OPENS FARMERS1 FAIR
Spectators Crowd Streets to
See 59 Floats of the
Annual Stunt.
ZONE IS A FEATURE
"Follies," Minstrels and 40
Side Shows Add to Its
Attraction.
Journalism visitors turned out this
morning to witness the parade of the
Farmers' Fair. They laughed and
marveled and admirtd, for the hftj
nine lloats that the Farmers had pre
pared for the occasjon were worthy
of these various emotions. The spec
tators said as much and the agri
cultural students did not deny it.
The "Injunction" was nothing legal.
It was a water wagon .tjpical of the
popular and general vehicle of Co
lumbia. "Villa or iiust" represented,
more or less trulj-, the expedition in
to Mexico. ".Mutt and Jetf" had no
connection with Hud Fisher's widelj
known characters, but displajed the
farm virtues of economy and ingenu
ity in a machine constructed of 17a
pieces of junk found on farms in the
state.
Throngs followed the parade to the
fair grounds, where they witnessed
the wonders of the Zone and quenched
their thirst with soft drinks at the
Yellow Dog Saloon. The "Follies,"
the minstrel show, the "death-defj-ing
high diving" exhibition, the bump-the-bumps
and the human roulette
wheel furnished amusement.
Forty side shows lined the Zone.
Gay and suspiciouslj- robust girls
from the Follies Ilirted with the visit
ors, some of whom did not detect the
deception.
A feature of the 191G fair was the
expansion of the educational exhibits
One building is devoted entirely to
.this pliae of the fair.
"PHEVCH FUR PL IV fiOM'KL"
HsMprrs Chance to Serve Miovvn
1 1) llnncj Ingham.
People in university communities
take education too much as a matter
of course, said Harvej Ingham, edi
tor of the Des Moines H gister and
Tribune, in an address at the Univer
sity Auditorium last night.
Mr. Ingham said that the sacrifice
for edacatiou was much less now than
in pioneer dajs; that indeed theie was
m some parts of ths industrial woild
a tendency to discount the value of a
university training and to discrimi
nate against it; and that if the people
as a whole did not awaken to the fal
lacy of such a position it would be im
possible for the United .States to main
tain htr present high estate.
Mr. Ingham thought that the news
papers should be the missionaries of
fair play, such fair play as is to be
found en the athletic Held, the prize
ring, and nowhere else in all the
world. The newspapers alone can be
'he prophet to lead the people into an
inheritance of fair play in political
economic and social life.
The newspapers should induce into
the world of affairs the courtesj of the
banquet table, where nobody grabs,
because evcrjono knows there is en
ough to go 'round. At present,
through inequality of distribution,
one-half the families live below the
lino of comfort and one-third within
two days of the hunger line.
"We will never," said Mr. Ingham,
"be able to build up a great civiliza
tion in this world until an equable dis
tribution is obtained. Xo civilization
has ever persisted built on a submerg
ed tenth."
EDITORS I. INFORMAL TALKS

J. K. Pool Advises.
In response to a question "How to
Ruj a Xewspaper," J. Kelly Pool to
daj advised the prospective bujer to
find a town where there are people
and monej in plenty. However, he
continued, there are instances where
editors have made money by owning
a newspaper In a wide place of the
road. He cited the Russellville Rust
ler, of which H Ray Franklin is the
editor.
II. J. Hlanton of the Paris Appeal
said the record of the last owners of
the paper was not a criterion of pos
sibilities as a financial venture. He
said it was the "punch" of the man
who was running the paper that
counted. II. F. Chlldcrs of the Troy
Free Press agreed.
BANQUET
I'ELLS OF CIRlTLniON HELPS
It. H. Caldwell Ad uses Haiimr Man)
Countrj Correspondent.
R. H. Caldwell, editor of the Mon
ticello Journal. Month ello. Mo, talked
jesterdaj on "How We Make A Coun
try Newspaper." The chief problem
Mr. Caldwell presented was that of
increasing circulation. He suggested
as a means to this end manj corres
pondents "persons of discretion, who
can say something." His own corres
pondents, lie said, were in every town
in iiis county, and in half the school
districts. As a rule he has teachers,
who can both write and collect news.
"News," according to .Mr Caldwell,
"must be written In such language
that it is attractive. The stjle of the
paper must be interesting. The ad
vertising columns must bear clean
advertising, especially local advertis
ing, which the editor should solicit
faithfully."
Premiums Air. Caldwell condemned
because too often there is nothing to
back them up, and if there is that
backing, premiums are unnecessarj,
he believes.
In closing, Mr. Caldwell spok of
the mission of the countrj' nevvspa
Ier for moral uplift.
"One of the highest possible ambi
tions is to help the other fellow," he
said. "In editing and publishing a
country paper one's highest aim
should ba to publish it for the better
ment and uplift of humanity, and in
so doing, to be a friend to man."
AD CURS FOR MORE UMTY
Kansas ( Itj Votes to Help St. Louis
in Obtaining 1917 Convention.
A movement was started at the an
nual meeting of the Associated Ad
vertising Clubs of Missouri Wednes

the business interests of Missouri. To
show that the ad clubs meant what
they said, the Kansas City Ad Club
voted unanimously to assist St. Louis
in obtaining the 1917 convention of
the Associated Advertising Clubs of
the World.-
This is said to be the first time com
mercial organizations of St. Louis and
Kansas City ever combined on anj
thing. The Kansas City Ad Club was rep
resented by L. E. Holland and George
F. McKcnnej-. The St. Louis Club was
represented by C. A. Ketchum. W. S
Donaldson, Charles E. Hatfield and
C. A. Collier. A. C. McGinty of Neos

the Heads and Make-Up.
"The Shoo Window" was the sub
ject of the address of I.ee A White.
associate professor of journalism In
tlio Universitj- of Washington, jester
daj'. He compared the paper uninter
esting in tjpography and make-up to
the country store with clutfred win
dows and stale wares.
Air. White paid tribute to the work
of the coiev-rcader and the make-up
man, who make the attractive appear
ance of the paper possible.
"We must have attractive artistry,"
ho said. "Disnlav jour wares in jour
shop window. Much time is spent by
the publisher in selling white space
which would sell Itself if the paper
had tli3 circulation which comes from
an attractive appearance. It's all
right till something better comes
along; we bought at the country store
once when there was nothing better
The reporter does a great work In
Catherine the news, hut between him
and the reader are the copj -reader

And it is a great service to do this."
