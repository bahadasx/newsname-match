" The impeachment trial i3 on in
full blast at Nashville this
week. 'Proof is being taken.
The attorneys for the defendant

and seem to be trying to prolong:
the trial as much as possible.' It
may ' last from one to four
months. . .. ... -i
The grand jury is investigat
ing the killing of Stokes at
'Nashville last week. , This was
one of the most atrocious and
bloody cold hearted killings ever
known. sc When Carmackf was
killed he had at least a . chance
for his life, and - was prepared.
In this instance Stokes was given
no showing. , ; :

The deceased was a first class citi
zen and a most industrious and suc
cessful farmer.
Few men had a better character
for upright Christian ' integrity .than
Mr. Swain. "
rEWYORK
LETTER
Before I forget it, I want to call
attention to a serious mistake made
by your typesetters in my mother's
poem on "Lake B'eau Clair," in my re
cent letter on Florida. The first two
lines of the-last verse"which, accord
ing to the carbon copy now in my
t desk, were written: '. , , , -,
In the radiant west, the magic
' Repeats itself in the lake below,1
' bv some unaccountable twist of the
.hand, the printer made to read:
; "Repeats itself in the lake of snow."
This chilly change, bo foreign to the
subject, mars the piece, and I hope
those admirers of my mothers verse
who may have preserved it will, make
this correction, so as to give it the
meaning she gave it. Your typos are
' more accurate, as a rule, than those
of the average country newspaper.
I trust that all poems of my. mother,
when offered for printing, will be
carefully read in proof. The ; word
"galm" for "calm" in another part of
the same poem of course will be under
stood as a mistake, but these little
errors hurt a poem worse than ordi
nary prose, and should carefully be
. avoided. , ,.r.f V , .
In a recent letter I had something
i to say about music, and particularly
songs; a subject of the greatest inter
est to me. A good song is like
good friend and companion, that stays
' with you to the end, , and has power
to comfort you in distress. There
no telling the effect our sacred hymns
have had in spreading healthy ideas
of "religion over the world. In Nash
villa once I heard an Armenian sing
"I Need Thee Every Hour," in his
native language; he had heard in the
dark recesses of Turkey, where
shone like a beacon of light in the
gloomy desert of Islamism. The hymns
of Wesley and Watts have made mil
lions better bv hearing them, and
have been sung in hundreds of differ
ent tongues in the nttermoat parts of
the earth. No hymn-writers in al
history have done the work ours have
done, that is, those who havy written
' in English. The songs of P. P. Bliss,
as
published in the seventies, such
Hold the Fort, for I am coming, What
Shall the Harvest Be, and Almost per
suaded, have circled the globe. Poor
BUii was burned, to death Id a railroad
wreck at Ashtabula, Ohio, in the prime
of his young fame, but he had left an
indelible impression on the hearts t)f
millions. Moody and Sankey made
his songs known and loved from Maine
to California.1 ' The Sweet By and By
written by a Bchool-teacher named
Webster, owed its remarkable popu
larity to a singular' simplicity and
strength of melody and wording. The
tune is of Celtic plainness, and can
almost all of it be played on the black :
keys of an organ.' At any rate, it
took the country by storm, and is now
and then still heard in churches. ''
One of the most interesting stories
I ever heard about a hymn was told
me by a United States marine officer
whose sworn statement I took in a
pension claim at Washington. He
was one of the guards of the Embassy
at Pekin during the Boxer Rebellion
in China in the summer of 1900.
Word came one day that the Boxers
were burning Christian Chinese to
death in a town some miles out of
Pekin, and he was one of a detachment
sent there in haste, with machine
guns to rescue the victims of the yel-
ow savages. The marine said that as
. i i m a i.
nis company came in signs oi me
place of death, , the smoke could be
seen rolling up, and there were min
gled cries of pain, yells of wrath and
the noise of the beating of tom-toms,
A fusillade from the machine guns
(which fired ten shots a second) scat
tered the Boxers like a gang of wild
beasts, and a terrible sight was
I brought to view: A row of fence
posts where a fence bad been torn
down, the Christian Chinese, men and
women, tied to the posts with -baling
wire, ana lence palings ana oroxen
furniture from their x homes piled
around them, while a yellow devil in
painted robes went from one pile to
the other, setting it -on fire with a
torch. Life was extinct in several of
the burned bodies, bnt as the marines
drew near they could hear the poor
Christians not yet burnt singing, in a
oud, clear voice, in Chinese language,
but in the dear old tune that we all
know: '
"Jesus lover of my soul," 7 v
J Let me to Thy bosom fly!" . , .
The marine said the tears came to
his eyes as "he heard this song and
ran forward with all speed, along with
the company, scattering the deadly
fire-brands and rescuing the martyrs,
BBToral if whom had not been touch
ed by the flames One poor girl had
been scorched by the fire on one side,
but with her sound arm she clasped
his neck and kissed him as he threw
the fire-wood from her and cut the
wires Chat were holding her to a cru
el death.' How many Christians of
the white race have faith like this, in
a future life and salvation, and in the
presence of horror such as faced those
Chinese converts? There is no doubt
about the truth of this story, as it is
now on record in the government ar
chives, aa a piece of sworn evidance
in a pension claim. " The song sung
by those Chinese, martyrs . was my
mothers favorite hymn. It is strange
that in all our, Southland there is no
singer of fame, Only one, Mrs. E. L,
Ashford, of Nashville, author of The
King of Love my Shepherd is, has
composed music of reputation. The
so-called plantation songs of the South
such as - Way Down on the Suwannee
Ribber, OM Black Joe, My Old Ken
tucky Home and such gems, are the
work of Stephen C Foster, a Penn
sylvania man, who died in war times.
He also wrote Massa'a in, de Cold, Cold
Ground, Gentle Annie, Old Uncle Ned,
and about a hundred vocal favorites,
and was under forty when he died-r
the greatest song genius this country
has ever seen. And yet for this glo
rious work he received less pay than
one tingle-tangle ditty of Irving Ber
lin or Fred Fisher brings to-day.
These songs are from the soul, and
were not written for money. Foster
could no more help singing than ' can
the mocking-bird or thrash on a sum
mer morning. "Dixie" was written
by Dan Emmet, of this city.
There are some more splendid songs,
such as Silver Threads Among the
Gold, Rocked in the Cradle of the
Deep, Her Bright Smile Haunts me
Still and (quit recently) In the Shade
of the Old Apple Tree. The song
about "Darling I am Growing Old,
Silver Threads Among The Gold, "etc.
was written by a young florist o:
Mains. Eben E. Rexford. He bow
writes (or floral magaiioei dv bow to
raise morning glories, is a hopeless
bachelor,, and has a head bald as an
ostrich egg. What do you think
of that? -
. Among some of the most . beautif al
melodies in the world are the folk
songs of Russia and Germany, and es
pecially the latter. - One of them,
When the. Swallows Homeward Fly
(not a drinking song) by Abt, is won
derful.' Others, , Buch as the Wine
Song, The Tyroler and His Child the
Hymn to freedom (Freiheit die ich
meine), Must I go to the City Far A
way, Soldier's Morning Song, and hun
dreds of others, have been a delight
to me for years. The Swiss shepherd
songs, with their yodling attachments
which sound like the hoo-ah-hoo that
our McNairy boys used to be fond of
practicing while going home from
their plowing) are very sweet. One
of them: "Maedele, ruck, ruck, ruck,
ruck an meine gruene Seite" (Girlie,
come along, come along, etc.) used to
make my fathlr laugh every time he
heard it, although' he did not under
stand a word of it. -
Wagner's music, as a rule, is heavy,
but his Swang Song from Lohengrin,
ilgrim's Chorus, and above all, '0
Thou Sublime, Sweet Evening Star,
"From Tannhaueacr, put him in the
rank of the world's best musicians.
t is a far cry from thst music to the
old-time hymns our fathers and moth
ers sang iu the little country churches.
The favorites were few, but there
were old stand-bys like "On Canaan's
Stormy Banks I Stand," and Old Hun
dred, that never wore out.' My moth
er told me of how the preacher would
give out the hymn, a line or two at a
time, and the congregation would fol-
ow the best they could. She heard
a joke, when a girl, of a preacher
giving out the old, old-timer, beginning:
"Jesus my all to heaven has gone."
While that line was being sung, he
looked out of the window and called
out: i
'There goes a horse with a side
saddle on!" which words, rhyming
With the first line, were promptly
sung by the congregation as part of
he hymn.' I suspect this story is
about as old as the song itself, but it
harts nobody to tell it once more.
One more joke will be enough here.
It is told that a bridal couple, the man
being many years the oldest, marched
to the marriage aitar to the tune of
What Shall the Harvest Be?" the
song having been selected by the
bride herself. !
Let us not forget the old songs,
While we are keeping green the mem
ories of the McNairy pioneers, let the
familar hmyns and tunes of by-gone
years be sung again. As the sweet,
familar strains are heard, the mind
will bring back the faces of the. loved
and lost who once joined in the sing
ing; and who has not some friend or
loved one connected in his memory
with some melody they used to sing?
When that old song is beard,
"Remembrance, faithful to her
' ..- trust, ..;' iv l:r-
, Calls them in beauty from the
: d'ist." ' .7 : ' '-
Few of the new songs can equal
those we knew long ago, either in
melody or sentiment Some 'of the
best of these songs are of foreign or
igin.-. Nearer My God, to Thee"
(McKinley's favorite) is adapted from
Thomas Moore'B "Oft in the Stilly
Night;" . "Where he leads me, I will
Follow," is of Italian origin, and so is
the tune of "Home Sweet Home."
"Blest be the Tie that Binds,", is a
German tune, as is also "Joy to the
World, the Lord is Come," and many
others. The oldest known tone is
"There is a Happy Land," known to
have' been sung 3,000 years ago as a
hymn by the Buddhist priests in India.
Russian music is now making its way
here. I wish my readers could hear
the "Cossack Cradle Song," the words
of which I have translated into Eng
lish, but which cannot be described
here. If there were mere music in the
world, there would be less war and
misery.

Tim Nightmare and Awaking.
As the coming year prest on me, and my forces begin to' break,
- t And the lonely midnight finds me tossing wearily awake,'
Much I long for restful slumber; yes, it would be real joy f
r- Once again to sleep as sweetly as a happy little boy.
, Through the dark and silent vigil, memory brings again to me -
Thoughts of home and rest and mother in my childhood's Tennessee;
Visions of the blissful evenings, when that mother, long since dead, ;
With a kiss and gaod-night greeting tucked me in my trundle bed.
Summer twilight veiled the landscape in a pall of starry gloom;
Through the silver moonlight floated scents of honeysuckle bloom;
, , Whippoorwill down in the orchard sang his lulling roundelay;
Soon on waves of soothing slumber my young spirit swam away, '
To a realm of things enchanted; fruits no daylight ever saw:
. Rainbow-tinted rocks and rivers; gems and flowers without a flaw;
Sainted maidens clothed in raiment whiter than the driven snow
Ah, I was an ardent dreamer in those nights of long ago!
But anon the curtain shifted, and the Nightmare's vision dread
Filled me with a dire foreboding from the Empire of the Dead; ' -,
Satan's angels gathered 'round me, and in terror 1 could see
What 1 thbught the dark and distant future held in store fr me:
' Swept by flames infernal, all Creation seemed afiire;
Evn grass and trees were burning; to the limbs in anguish dire.
Blazing human forms were cling, while their ribs fell to the ground
, . Wreathed in flaming, sulphurous halo, with an awful hissing sound!
, Frozen stiff with deadly languor, still I tried to run away,
But my limbs were stark and helpless, and in anguish there I lay;
V Then, as ciown of all Jhe terrors, for it was the final stroke,
My dead mother lay before me. Screaming loudly, 1 awoke.
O, the joy of that awaking, and to see my mother there, .
: Smiling at my childish terror, stroking my disheveled hair! .
And the morning sunlight streaming through the window made me glad;
.. Chased away the awful shadows of the Nightmare I had. ,
And I think of the Awaking that may sometime come to me,
When the weary, sad existence of this earth shall cease to be;
When my mother in her beauty I shall see in glad surprise,
- And my father bids me welcome, to a home in paradise.
