OBSTRUCT NAVIGATION
And Are a Source of Danger
and Damage to Passing
Boats.
The Palatka News has received the
following letter from Major W. B.
Ladue, of the U. S. District Engin
eers office, Jacksonville, which is
self-explanatory:
Editor Palatka News:
Dear Sir: Complaints have been
made to this office concerning sun
ken logs and parts of rafts in va
rious portions of the navigable chan
nel of the St. Johns River, in the
dredged channel at the foot of Cres
cent Lake, and in the Oklawaha Riv
er. 1 hese sunken Iocs and vnft.a
a source of danger and damaee to
passing boats.
All parties towiner losrs on the St.
Johns River and its tributaries are
invited to cooperate with this office
in keeping the channels clear by re
quiring their employees to use care
in making up and handling bundles
and rafts of logs so as to avoid drop
ping loirs in the channel.
The Federal laws for the protection
of navigable waters specially pro
hibit carelessness in this respect, and
this office will take steps to institute
proceedings against persistent offen
ders upon presentation of necessary
evidence. The law provides that if
a conviction is secured, one-half of
the fine assessed will go to the in
former. I shall be glad to have you give
this matter publicity in your columns.
Very respectfully,
W. B. SADUE,
Major, Corpe of Engineers.

Dr. Johnson Says "No."
Dr. H. A. Johnson of this city has
been urged repeatedly by friends in
the city and county who have come to
know and appreciate his sterling
"Democracy," to become a candidate
for State Executive Committeeman,
but to all importunities that ho run
he has said "No" in such a way as to
leave no doubt of his meaning.
Dr. Johnson has a large practice
and in addition to this he will from
now on for the next year have some
burden of a public nature to carry as
one of the bond trustees of the local
road district. That he appreciates
the confidence of his friends, however,
in thus urging him to take on the ad
ditional duties, is apparent.
Other candidates for State Execu
tive Committeeman so far to an
nounce are Chas. Burt, assistant
cashier of the Putnam National Bank,
and H. M. Fearnside of the Browning
Fearnsido Co., both excellent young
men.
Exercises By Kindergartners.
One of the most interesting classes
of educational primary work in Palat
ka, is the Kindergarten class, under
the direction of Mrs. George W. Lan
sing. The little tots show the care
ful training bestowed upon them, as
evidenced bv the obedience, and alert
ness which they manifest and the won
derful patience ot their teaener in
dealing with their childish difficulties
is really marvelous. The exercises
given recently by the class in the par
lors of Mr. and Mrs. Julian De Naza
rie which were decorated in flags and
white olianders, were delightfully ren
dered by the class of ten little tots.
There were songs, recitations and
drills by the class. Mrs. R. S.
O'Haver presided at the piano for th
songs. After the exercises, the chil
dren had an animal cracker hunt, for
which a prize of a box of animal
crackers was awarded.
The class sat at a long table and
were served cream and cake, as were
the guests of the class, who came to
witness the exercises. The class
members are Lane Waters, Margaret
and Frances Porter, Edwin Morrison,
Charles Fields. John Berry Davis, Ju-
lis and Florence De Nazarie, Freder
ick Brown and Frances Thompson.

PALATKA, FLORIDA, FRIDAY. MAY 5, 1916.
BIG REALTY DEALS
E
Good Roads and Other Im
provements Creating a De
mand for Real Estate.
NEW HOTEL STARTED.
Important Purchases of
Large Properties in Clay
and St. Johns Counties
Considerable activity in real estate
is noticed in the Palatka teriitory
which includes parts of St .Johns
and Clay counties as well as Putnam
A very encouraging feature of thi3
activity is the building of a new hotel
in Palatka and the purchase by a
local company of a resort hotel in
Green Cove Springs which indicates
a very hopeful prospect of a pyhvI
tourist business for this part of Flori
da next year.
Both of these hotels, it will be no
ed, are on the great Spa route be
tween Jacksonville and Tampa which
will pass through Rodman, Kenwood,
Oiange Springs, Bay Lake, Ft. Mc
Coy, Eurbank, Silver Springs and
Ocala.
Work of demolishing the old Ar
lington Hotel, in Palatka preliminary
to the erection of a modern, three-
story brick hotel by Dr. Geo. E.
Welch, was commenced last week.
The new building, will be one of th.;
best equipped and most modernly ap
pointed in this section of Florida.
In Green Cove Springs R. L. Do,v
ling and his associates acquired the
stock of L. H. McKee in the Green
Cove Springs Development Co., and
purchased from Mr. McKee the Qui
sisana hotel property.
All of the property, spring and ho
tel, golf links and the vacant lots be
tween the spring and the river are
now the property of the Green Cove
Springs Development Co., with R. L.
Dowling, as president, John T. Craw
ley, secretary, and R. O. Dennard, as
treasurer.
This and the Palatka hotel will be
open all the year.
Recent large investments by the
Southern Cattle Feeding Company
of Ohio which has a 25,000 acre ranch
near Green Cove Springs and by
Du Pont Company of a camphor
farm of several thousand acres here
as well as at Satsuma in Putnam
County have had a tendency to in
creased land values in the Palatka
Green Cove district particularly along
the line of the Georgia Southern and
Florida Railroad.
A deal involving several thousand
dollars has been closed in St. Johns
county whereby E. C. Poe of Dun
nellon becomes the owner of the Mc
Callum property at Matanzas. There
are about three thousand acres in
volved and it is the intention of Mr.
Poe to operate at full capacity the
manufacture of naval stores. He has
also some important plans in view
along the lines of agricultural devel
opment of a portion of the property
which is admirably situated on the old
King's road and on the banks of
Pellicer creek, eighteen miles down
the coast" from St. Augustine, and
due east from Hastings.
Over in Lake county, Mr. Poe has
met with considerable success in the
growing of natal grass, and it is his
plan to sow a small acreage on his
new property with a view to seeing
if it will not prove as successful in
St. Johns county as it has proven in
Lake county and other places in mid
dle Florida. New Florida.
Parent-Teachers' Association.
The last meeting of the school year
of the Palatka Parent-Teachers' As
sociation will be held at 3 p. m., next
Thuisday, May 11th. The meeting
will be first a business meeting, fol
lowed by the annual election of of
ficers, this will be followed with a
social hour ,when light refreshments
will be served. Then will be an in
spection of exhibit work throughout
the school, it is urgea mat cvwj
member of the association be present ,
at this meeting, and all others inter-1
ested in the welfare .of the school are .
invited and will be made welcome, it ,
is expected also that the new school
trustees will be present, and it is
hoped to make this a real get-together
meeting in the interest of the Pa
latka School.
The Bardin Picnic.
Farmers and others interested in
the meeting to promote interest in the
cultivation of strawberries in the wes
tern section of the county, especially
in the neighborhoods of Carraway,
Bardin, Harlem, Bannerville and other
points, should not forget the mcet-.ng
and banket picnic to be held at Bar
novt. Wednesday, the 10th inst.
Sneakers familiar with strawberry
culture, will be present, and their ob
iect will bo to so stimulate interest
in the work as to secure a large acre
age in these sections, acreage suffici
ent to warrant buyers being present
to pav the market price for these ber
rie! dailv on delivery to some central
point. It is believed that much of the
land in these sections is specially
"dnpted to strawberry culture and
that their growing in large quantities
will mean a splendid money crop to
the people.
Great Truth.

TICK ERADICATION
Has Begun Under Direction
of Well Known Organi
zation. At a final meeting held at Jackson
ville on April 25th, an organization
to be known as the "Florida Cattle
Tick Eradication Committee of the
Southern Settlement & Development
Organization" was fully completed,
and will begin active operations im
mediately. The committee is com
posed of J. M. Burguieres, chairman;
J. E. lngraham, vice chairman; Ar
thur G. Cummer treasurer, W. F.
Coachman, secretary; Clement S. Uck
er, and Robert M. Pindell, Jr., the last
named being vice-presidents of the
Southern Settlement & Development
Organization. P. L. Sutherland of
Jacksonville, has been appointed man
ager, and offices have been taken in
the Consolidated building.
In addition to the gentlemen above
named, there were present at this
meeting, Dr. E. M. Nighbert, of the
Federal Bureau of Animal Industry,
Inspector in charge of Tick Eradica
tion in Georgia and Florida. Prof.
P. J. Rolfs and Dr. J. M. Scott of the
University of Florida, and Dr. F.
Dawson of the Florida State Board of
Health. It is the purpose of the
committee to at once undertake an ac
tive State-wide campaign of informa
tion and education in cattle tick eradi
cation, and to bring to its aid and
assistance, as far as possible, every
orgnization and individual in the State
of Florida who is interested in a big
gef and better Florida. The warm co
operation of the Federal Department
of Agriculture; the State Department
of Agriculture? the State Agricultur
al College; the State Board of Health,
and the Florida Live Stock Associa
tion have already been assured, and
resolutions were recently adopted by
the State Bankers Association at Day
tona and by the State Press Associa
tion at Kissimmee, offering definite
co-operation in the proposed campaign
and characterizing it as the principal
business issue before the people of
Florida.
The organization of this movement
arose out of the conclusion reached
by the officers of the Southern Set
tlement & Development Organization,
after full investigation and considera
tion 'that the substantial Florida of
the future must depend upon an in
telligent and steady development of
the cattle business along with the de
velopment of other lines of agriculture
now so well under way. The first
concrete step in this movement was
the Florida Cattle Conference held at
lampa on February 7th and 8th last.
This was designed to bring out as
far as possible, in open discussion, by
men of special training and experi
ence the real conditions in Florida,
whether advantageous or otherwise,
with respect to the cattle industry.
Much of a useful and interesting na
ture was disclosed in this meeting,
and it was shown in a most striking
manner, by speakers of experience and
expert knowledge, who took part in
the discussion, that until the Texas
lever cattle tick is entirely eliminat
ed from the State, and the Federal
quarantine restrictions removed, the
cattle business can never reach that
hiirh state of development which is
justified by the conditions of Florida
soil and climate.
Since the Tampa conference there
have been a series of meetings in
Jacksonville of representatives of
large interests throughout the State,
for the puropse of discussing the
method which ought to be pursued to
obtain the most satisfactory results.
The earnestness of these discussions
has been striking, and as a result a
large fund has been placed at the dis
posal of the committee for the purpose
of prosecuting the work.
Manager Sutherland is now en
gaged in preparing a plan of cam
paign for submission to the Executive
Committee at its next meeting, which
will be held early in the month of
Mav. It is the desire and intention
cf the committee to seek all the ad
vi(.e possible jn the preparation of its
panS( and when these pIans are finai
,y agreed upon to press the work
;.ith the utmost vigor. The com-
mittee has already been assured by
those in a position to know, that the
methods thus far followed in com
pleting its organization are by far the
most effective and far-reaching of any
movement of the kind heretofore un
dertaken in the quarantined area.

STATE AUDITOR'S
SPECIAL REPORT
Ordered Published by Cir
cuit Judge Wills.
It will be remembered that at the
spring term of the circuit court last
month the grand jury in its present
ment recommended that the report of
tne special auait ot the books and ac
counts of the various county officers
be ordered published, and Judge Wills,
in coriiormity to tne recommendations
of the jury ordered County Clerk
Hutchinson to procure a copy and
nave it puonshed.
Ihe report arrived yesterday, and
was sent to tne limes-Herald as of
ficial paper of the county for nubli
cation. The lateness of its arrival
made it impossible for The News also
to give the full report.
It is sufficient to sav that the re-
port finds that the books and records
of the clerk, the sheriff, the tax col
lector, county treasurer. suterintend-
ent of public instruction are all correct
and given a clear bill.
In the case of the Countv .Tudirn
there is a difference of some $40 in
lees in dispute, and which the auditor
claims should be turned over to the
county, but Judge Haskell, who comes
pretty near knowing the law as well
as the auditor, refuses to pay the
amount over, stating "that his acts
in binding over the various parti
were judicial determinations in the in
terest of the public and should be pai
for."
In the case of Justice J. E. Marshall,
there is also a demand on the pnrl
the auditor for the return of fees. Hr
He finds that it is the usual custom
of this officer in cases where a num
ber of parties are arrested on the
same date for such offenses as gam
bling and train riding to try each in
dividual case separately. This cus
tom violates no law within my knowl
edge, but the costs to be paid by the
county would be decreased by making
one case against a group of offenders
when the parties are all arrested at
one time and guilty of the same of
fense. There is some other criticism
of Judge Marshall's system, with a re
quest that he return to the county cer
tain excess fees, but this request
Judge Marshall refuses on the ground
that he felt that he was entitled to
them.
In the case of the county commis
sioners it was found that they had
drawn during 1915 more than the $200
per annum which they are allowed by
law. This was pointed out by the au
ditor to have been regularly drawn as
per diem pay, but as the statue pro
hibits county commissioners in coun
ties of less than 20,000 inhabitants to
draw more than a total of $200, there
was an excess, which the commission
ers have returned as follows:
D. P. Hancock, $81; W. C. Alvers,
$68.25; E. B. Perry, $80; T. M. Wal
dron, $6; C. E. Rowton (proportion
ately) $8. It was pointed out also
that the board had sat many days as
drainage commissioners, which ac
counted for the excess time.
In the case of Treasurer J. E. Ed-'
monson there is a lost check to ac
count for. His records show that a
check for 111.50 was probablv received
from the late J. L. Burton for justice
court fines. Judge Burton's letter
enclosing check is on file, also Mr. Ed
monson's receipt made out and sitrned
but never delivered. But there is no
evidence thnt the cheek was ever cash
ed. The check vps never accounted
for pnd a demand his bpen made m
Mr. Edmonson fc the amount, which
he, nor any ore else ever drew.
Miss Purcell Honored.
Miss Leonore Purcell, who is the
guest of Miss Annie Bruce, is re
ceiving much social attention. Sat
urday, Aubrey Melton had as his mo
tor guests, Misses Purcell, Annie and
Vi Bruce and Louise Melton, on a
trip to McCullough's Creek," where
they spent a delightful day. Tues
day Mrs. W. A. Walton entertained
at dinner for Miss Purcell.
Tuesday afternoon Mrs. R. S.
O'Haver gave a thimble party in
which Miss Purcell was one of the
honor guests. Wednesday afternoon,
Miss Winnie Barstow entertained her
club, and invited Miss Purcell with
Miss Bruce, as spectators. Tomor
row, Mrs. Bruce and family with Miss
Purcell will take the Oklawaha trip
by boat, remaining over Sunday.
Entertains For Miss Cowles.
Tuesday afternoon Mrs. Robert S.
O'Haver gave a thimble party at the
Manse in honor of Miss Marjorie
Cowles of Chicago, who is a niece of
Rev. (J. M. Alford. Miss Cowles whj
is a student in the Chicago School of
Applied and Normal Art, has been
spending a three months' vacation in
Murry Hill, Jacksonville, with Dr. and
Mrs. Alford.
The afternoon was delightfully
spent while tongues and needles were
busy. Punch was drunk during the
afternoon, and later, an ice course
with salted almonds was served. The
guests were Misses Marjorie Cowles,
Leonore Purcell with Annie Bruce,
Irma Jane Lewis, Louise and Maye
Boyd, Ida Ieib Mesdames E. L. Mann
and J. E. Lucas.

TIE LIBRARY VOTING
CONTESljMROWI
Another Large Number of
Votes Cast.
The big Library Contest which
opened recently and news of which has
Been given in the Palatka News, has
exceeded all expectations on the start.
Interest was at fever heat even the
first day and those who are watching
the ballot box at the Ackerman-Stew-
art Drug Co., say it is wonderful the
way people are becoming interested in
this grand offer and a glance at the
standing of contestants will convince
you that they are correct.
One of our City's most brilliant lit
erary men has examined the books
and said that no hand could have se
lected beUer books than are contained
m this library and the sincerity of
the many compliments that have been
received at the Fearnside Clothing Co.
where the books are on pvliihiH ;
evidenced by the large poll of votes'.
oeverai oi tne merchants who are
interested m this grand offer say they
know of many people who are holding
back many thousands of votes! Some
are undecided what organization they
will work for and others are prepar
ing for a dark horse, so it behooves
all who are interested to clip the cou
pon from this paper and insist on re
ceiving votes from the merchants and
outness nrms who are giving them.
Lear them in mind. You will find
their names in the advertising col
umns of this paper from time to time.

Hon. John P. Wall of Putnam Hall
was a visitor in the city yesterday. It
has been whispered on the streets
here that Mr. Wall contemplates en
tering the legislative race, but that
gentleman says there is nothing to
the rumor other than that there has
been a demand on the part of his
neighbors and friends in West Putnam
that he should enter. There are oth
er reasons, however, which Mr. Wall
says will keep him from it. Asked
as to any expressions he might wish
to make, the ex-Senator from Putnam

Dr. Frank MeRae of Melrose drove

a person who expresses a regret for

crat. A little talk with the doctor
on Wednesday, convinced The News
man that here was one who held to the
eld-time principles of democracy and
who was a democrat with ample rea
sons for the faith that is in him. Dr.
McRae, when the new law enacted by
the last legislature, and which re
quires candidates for Representative
to run in groups, said "There is noth
ing fair in such a law; it deprives the
people of freedom of choice it was
not enacted as a measure for the peo
ple, but it was evidently intended as
a measure to heJp re-elect those al
ready in."
