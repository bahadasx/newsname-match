An estate that has been in the

Boys being "bound out" as

For some time past, several
business men at Nov'ger have
been planning to eef C-d there
a faotory for making un stocks.

Through the efforts of Col. A.
A. Hulett of the Webb City com
mercial club, 60,000 bass have
been put in Center creek near

thousand baby trout will be die

City within the next few days.
The unexpeoted happened at
Kirksville when thieves stole
from the site of the Chi Delta fra

in the night and the midoreants
used a wagon to remove their
loot.
A Schuyler oounty man is in a
quandary, Remembering two
dreams he had the other night,
he oonsulted a dream book, for
their interpretation. One of the
dreams meant that the dreamer
would be wed within six months.
The other dream was a warning
that his death was near at hand.
At Montgomery City, the re
oently elected oity marshal, oily
oolleotor and an alderman will
lose their viotory and cannot be
sworn into offiqe, beoause they

Earl MoCIellan exhibited eight
young wolves in the Grant City
Times office last Wednesday
night, whioh he had caught near
his home. The mother wolf had
made her nest under the roots of
tree on the side of a branoh,
and it took but little digging to
find the young ones. Twelve
young wolves were recently
oaught on the John Boedeoker
farm near Parnell.
A speed reoord In dealing out
justice was made by Judge E. S.
Gantt at his first term of oourt
held in Warren oounty. A man
who at 11 o'olook in the morning
stole $11 was arrested at 2 o'olook
in the afternoon, and two hours
later was under a two-year sen
tence for the offense. Judge
Gantt was appointed to the benoh
to fill the unexpired term of the
late Judge James D. Barnett of
the Eleventh circuit
When the O. K. oonduotor at
Pattonburg investigated a oar
loaded with household goods,
etc, he made a gruesome dis
covery. The body of the oocu-
pant of the oar was found hang
ing to the roof, a piece of baling
wire with a loop in the end in
whioh he had placed his neok
having been used to strangle
himself to death. The indica
tions were that he had been dead
about twelve hours. Investiga
lion of his papers showed that
his name was C. R. Renfrow and
that he was enroute from Lipton,
Wyoming, to Brimson, Mo. He
was about 40 years of age. The
oar was taken up by the O. K.
road from the Burlington rail
road at Osborne. The car con
tained household Roods, farming
implements and several bead of
live stock
- Fight Fire Blight Now.
Fir blight has appeared in the
orchards this spring and every
effected twig or branoh should
be removed before the disease
ha a chanoe to spread. . During
the last few years this disease
has done a great deal of damage
in peat and apple orchards and
the Missouri Agricultural Exper
iment Station finds it appearing
again this spring. Its effects are
not usually observed by the or
obardSst until May or June, when
manjbf the fruit clusters and
young twigs begin to die sudden
ly as if they had been scorched
by fire. The earlier symptoms
whioh should have warned him
to out baok the diseased parts at
once are the flow of a gumlike or
even a thin saplike liquid from
the bark, or the appearance of
beads of honey-like material on
the newly formed apples. This
material may spread like a soft
varnish, covering the fruits in
stead of remaining in beads.
The only known means of
ohecklng blight is to cut and burn
all the aff oted parts before the
disease is carried to the rest of
the orchard by bees and other in
seots, or has a ohance to spread
through the twigs themselves.
The pruning tools may carry the
germs if not carefully disinfeoted
by either dipping them into a 1
to 1000 solution of corrosive sub
limate, or wiping them with a rag
or sponge whioh has been dam
pened with suoh a solution car
ried tin a small bottle for this
purpose. Corrosive sublimate
also called biohlorlde of meroury
may be purchased at any drug
store th small bottles containing
about twenty-five tablets apiece
with directions for dissolving
theee tablets and making solu
tions of any desired strength.
Pruning tools should be disin
fected after pruning each tree so
that the disease will not be car
ried from tree to tree, and should
be disinfeoted still oflener than
this to avoid carrying the disease
from one part to another of the
same tree, as the pruner finds
that he is cutting through diseas
ed wood.
The blight usually passes the
winter in pear trees, but may
live through in Jonathan, Ingram,
Yellow Transparent, and similar
apple trees.
Orohards affected by blight
last year should be very carefully
watched now, and pear trees
whioh show blight scars or can
kers should be examined first ofi
ail. Blisters may form under the
bark, then burst after the trees
have begun to grow. From these
places there flows the honey-like
liquid whioh contains the baoter-
ial germs of blightwhioh bees
and other inseots are likely to
oarry from tree to tree. The bees
carry these germs to the flower
clusters of pears and apples and
the newly formed fruits may have
the beaded or varnished appear
anoe , whioh indicates that the
spurs on whioh they are growing
should be out and burned at onoe
The grower should not wait for
the blighted parts to die and turn
brown or black. To keep the
blight from spreading through
the whole orohard it is necessary
to find and out out the few early
Infections here and there. These
early infeotions may beooated
by observing fruit clusters where
the stems of the fruit look slight
ly discolored and show the stioky
exudations. J. C. Whitten, Mis
souri College of Agrioulture.
Up in Madison eounty a wo
man set under hens 113 eggs
from which 111 chickens were
batched. .'.
Growing Chicks Need Lots
Of Good Food.
Growing chioks require an
abundance of food whioh con
tains musole and bone building
material. Other things being
equal, failure to grow oan be at
tributed to an insufficient food
supply, a laok of musole making
food or too little mineral matter
suoh as bone meal.
A ohiok grows at an enormous
rate. At the University of Mis
souri it was found that a chick
weighed at 14 weeks just sixteen
times what it did when hatched.
If an infant grew as fast, a baby
weighing seven pounds at birth
would weigh 112 pounds when 14
weeks old. This shows that
ohioks should be fed liberally
and emphasizes the Importance
of seleoting the right kind of food.
Beoause of the remainder of
the yoke sack being drawn into
the body at hatohing, liberal
feeding during this time would
retard the absorption of this yoke
saok and might oauee trouble.
When the ohiok is 48 hours old a
few grains of sharp, fine sand
should be fed. The sand stimu
lates the digestive organs and
gets tbem in working order.
The chioks food should oonsist
of eracked grains such aB corn,
wheat and steel-cut oats, fed in
combination with some ground
food like bread crumbs, corn
bread or rolled oats. At the Un
iversity the ration for the first
week consists of "chick food" fed
three times a day and rolled oats
the other two. Sour milk is also
fed. The acid in the milk is
harmful to some disease germs
and the milk furnishes musole
forming food. Water with the
chill removed is fed in a fountain
so oonstruoted that the ohioks
cannot get wet. After the first
week a mixture of bran, shorts
and corn meal is substituted for
the rolled oats. When milk is
not fed fifteen pounds of fine beef
sorap and one part of bone meal
should be added to every 100
pounds of the mixture. The bone
meal will prevent leg weakness.
If the ohioks are confined, finely
out green grass, alfalfa leaves,
onions, etc, will keep the bowels
loose and the ohiok healthy.
Gradually the finer grains ean
be replaced by ooarser. The dry
mash oan remain as above. All
the feed oan be placed in hoppers
where the ohioks may help them
selves. Fine grit should always
be available. When the ohioks
have passed the danger point a
wet mash daily at about 4 p. m.
will induoe them to eat more and
will result in a more rapid growth
Eggs can be fed raw by stir
ring one in some ary ieeo ana
feeding this mixture to about six
ty ohioks. At all times the food
must be olean and free from mus
tiness or digestive troubles are
sure to result. The keeping of
the quarter olean and sweet is
squally important.
A result of a stubborn deter
mination of Emmett Ball, post
master at Seibert, not to affix and
cancel a 60-cent stamp, the post
office at Seibert, Dade oounty,
was erased from the postal map
March 31. Notice that the offioe
was discontinued was reoeived
from the postoffioe department at
offices in that distriot. The
cause of the row was the reoeipt
by Ball of bis bond with a re
quest that it be renewed. Ball
renewed the bond without the
stamp. It was sent baok and
forth many times, but each time
Ball refuted to oomply with the
federal regulations fcr his jab,
and th gov era went closed the
