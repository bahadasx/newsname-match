WASHINGTON, MAY 5. AFTER THE CABINET MEETING THIS
AFTERNOON, SECRETARY LANSING SAID NO "HASTY" ACTION
WOULD BE TAKEN IN VIEW OF THE LENGTH AND NECESSITY FOR
DIGESTING THE GERMAN NOTE. "IT IS IMPROBABLE," HE SAID,
j "THAT THERE WILL BE ANY DECISION BEFORE NEXT WEEK."
,By Associated Press.)
mrni IV Mnv S The German renlv In the I'nited States respecting
submarines was delivered to Ambassador Gerard last evening.
.Utt tha nnaalhllltv thai a uilhmnrina riiri sink the Sussex.
iMtri mini nullum imnniunnf - . . . . . .
.The American note asserted Germany ought to regard the Sussex incident as
one of the Indiscriminate destruction or vessels oi an sons, nationalities auu
destinations by submarines.
n,.ntnv miiut rami 4ista thin assertion nnri thinks it useless to enter
Into detail as the American statement has not subhtantiated the assertion
with concrete facts. Germany Imposed restraints-upon suomannes in con
sideration of the Interests of neutrals, despite the fact that these restrictions
were advantageous to her enemies. The allies showed no such consideration.
Submarines were ordered to proceed according to International law, to visit
and search before the destruction of merchantmen, except those being In
warfare against enemy freighters In the war lone. Assurances never were
given America In the declaratlorv-of February 8th, regarding these.
Germany repeatedly mentioned the dangers of mines to neutrals travel
ing and made proposals to America reducing these dangers, which unfor
innately America decided not to accept.
The Imperial government stands by Its offer to reach some agreement.
Germany cannot dispense with submarines, but decided to make further con
cessions by adapting submarines to the interests of neutrals.
Germany, although conscious of Germany's strength, twice within the
last few months announced Its readiness to make peace on the basis of safe-
guarding Germany's vital Interests, and Germany is prepared to do Its utmost
to confine the operations of war to the fighting forces, insuring freedom of
the seas. '
"Guided by this Idea," the message continues, "Germany notifies the
United States that the German naval forces received the following order:"
."In accordance with the general principles of visit and search
and destruction of merchantmen recognized by international law, such
; vessels both within and without the area declared to be in the war
zone, shall not be sunk without warning and without saving lives
unless such ship shall attempt to escape or offers resistance.
"But neutrals cannot expect Germany, which has been forced to fight
for existence, shall forsake for neutrals or restrict the use of an effective
weapon if the enemy Is permitted to continue to apply methods of warfare
violating international law. ,
"Accordingly Germany is confident that in consequence of the new
orders to her naval forces the United states win also consider an impeai
mor.1. nn.nvnit mwarri restoration of the freedom of the seas.
"Germany does not doubt that the United States will now insist that
England forthwith observe the rules or international law. anouia steps De

BERLIN, May 6. In the midst of
the widespread discussion that goes
on nnwadavs concerning the taxation.
someone has discovered that in the
city or Rostock, in MaeKienourg, mere
are a considerable number of persons,
many of them belonging to old noble
families, who under law extending
back into the middle ages are tax
free, even today."
, Their existence beiame known when
the Landtag or legislature of Mecklen-
Durg suggesiea more or less nuyniunj
that these "exempts" might at least
be willing to subject themselves to
some kind of an extraordinary war tax
so long as they bad not to pay any
of the peace taxes. Also It was point
ed out that many who had been in the
exempt class for years had, long ago,
voluntarily subjected themselves to
the taxes paid by their fellow citizens.
Back to the Landtag came the de
cisive answer: "The officials and no
bility of Rostrock to accept taxation
duty, since the are not prepared to
help cover the budget of Rostock from
their Incomes. They announce them-.
selves as ready, in place of the war
tax, to place at the disposal of the
authorities considerable sums toward
the. support of the needy lamiues oi
soldiers."
