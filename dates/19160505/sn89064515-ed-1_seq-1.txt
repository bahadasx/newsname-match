NIGHT SCHOOL IS CLOSED
SHORT BUT SUCCESSFUL TEEM
HELD HERE—WILL REOPEN
NEXT FALL
A short but nevertheless very suc
cessful term of night school, the first
of its kind ever held here, has just
closed. At the last meeting the stu
dents were very enthusiastic about
the results and were strongly in favor
of having* night school again next
year. There is no doubt about re
suming the work next year and the
term will begin in November, as soon
as cold weather sets in, and wil* last
about five months.
The night school which just closed
had an enrollment of 50 and an aver
age attendance of 15. Twenty-five
meetings were held, with two instruc
tors, M. "W. Zipoy, the high school
principal, and Miss Gebhardt, com
mercial instructor at the high school.
The students enrolled ranged in age
from 16 years to 60 years, and the
oldest was equally as anxious to learn
as the youngest. The instruction this
year was limited to three subjects,
arithmetic, beginners' English and
advanced English.
Following is a list of the names of
those who were enrolled:
John Anderson, Axel Anderson, J.

who is a candidate for representative
from Morrison. county. Mr. Rider was
in the legislature from the Morrison

the Morrison county-Crow Wing dis
trict one term and the Morrison coun

POSTOFHCE ROBBER CAUGHT
FRIESINGER GETS ROBBER OF
CLEAR LAKE POSTOFFICE
AND STAPLES STORE
A man who gives his name as
Charles Reardon was arrested by Hu
bert Friesinger, special agent for the
'Northern Pacific, Tuesday night and
is being held at the county jail here
for robbing the postoffice at Clear
Lake and for burglarizing a soft drink
parlor at Staples. He has confessed
to committing bpth crimes. A feder
al officer from St. Paul will probably
call for him today.
Friesinger saw the man leap from
a train here Tuesday night and when
he called on him the man started to
run. Suspecting that the man might
be a criminal, Friesinger demanded
that he stop but his demands had to
be backed up with a shot from his
pistol before they were successful.
Friesinger searched the man and found
the articles stolen from the Staples
store, including knives, razors, a
watch, etc., and some cash. He also
had a supply of postage stamps and
parcel post stamps, $50 in bills and
other articles, on his person, some of
this being in a sack which he carried
under his arm. The stamps corres
ponded with those taken from the
Clear Lake postoffice, where $75
worth of stamps, $60 in cash and some
railroad checks were stolen.
A reward of $50 is offered by "the
government for this kind of offense,
which will go to Friesinger.
Postoffice Inspector M. I. Ryan
came up from St. Cloud yesterday and
he notified the U. S. Marshal at St.
Paul, and a deputy will arrive today.
The complaint will be sworn out by
the deputy and Reardon will have his
hearing before U. S. Court Commis
sioner Cameron some time today.
William, the little son of Harry
Keeler, was bitten quite badly by a
