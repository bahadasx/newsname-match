Irish Revolt Suddenly Checked
Strikes in This Country
Sunday in Kansas City.
Certainly there never was a
period when the world saw as
much general disturbance as
exists at this time. The capture
by the Turks in Messapotamia
of the entire army of the English,
numbering 13000; the uprising
of Irish against the general con
scription order by England and
the execution of Peter H. Hearse,
the president of the Irish insur
gents, James Connollby, the head
of the insurgent army and an
other; the strikes inaugurated by
labor organizations resulting in
the walk out or forcing out of
nearly a million wage earners al
ready and extending to all parts
of the country; and last but not
necessarily least, Billy Sunday
trampling all over Kansas City.
The United States has been
ordered out of Mexico but an
agreement that the troops of
this country shall have the right
to remain 60 days longer and be
cooperated with by Carranzistas
in the hunt for Villa has about
been reached.
The situation around Verdun
remains about the same and the
great war shows no signs of
weakening at any point.
County Sunday School Meet
We are advised by one of the
most prominent and efficient
Sunday School workers in the
county that the schools need in
spiration and a whole lot of other
things which schools have and
those in this county are deplor
ably short on.
- This energetic young' woman
says that greater proficiency
must be attained by teachers or
the inevitable consequence of
want of interest and loss of prop
er biblical instruction will over
take the pupils.
We are further advised by this
young women that there will be
two notable workers present
and address the convention at
Sumner May8-9 Herman W. Bow
mar, ueni. secty. lor mo. and
Mrs. T. G. Klepper, a former
resident of Sumner.
Thru Mrs. Kleppers ability
and untiring efforts it is said
that Clinton County is far ahead
of any other in the state in re
spect of the condition of Sunday
schools. She is a resident of
Lathrop, an enthusiast and high
ly intellectual and her old . ac
quamtances will not only enjoy
her visit but profit by her knowl
edge of this great branch of ed
ucation.
Chief Tisdaie V trying to keep
live stock out of the public high
ways. Complaints reach him
from every Quarter and in many
instances before he can appre
hend the work stock, cows and
calves, swine and nondescripts,
they have devastated a front
yard, flower bed or swill bucket
The Chief is growing more pop
ular by his efforts just the same
got the offender in each case.
Jno. K. Butler, a native o
this city and grandson of Mrs,
D. B. Kellogg, who has been
assistant general freight agent
of the Southern Pacific railway
with headquarters at Frisco, has
accepted the position of traffic
manager for a railroad in the
Hawaiian Islands with head
quarters at Honolulu. He wil
depart for his new home some
time in June.
Mr. Howard Schoew changed
his plans and stayed over for

Sunday in Kansas City
Billy Sunday arrived for his
seven weeks series as it is
called, in Kansas City and was
met by a number of automobiles
and a large crowd of the curious.
He and his family will occupy
the Judge Wm- H. Wallace man
sion during his stay, Judge Wal
lace and family going to his
arm for the time.
There will be a full house out
each time, no doubt, and that
means something like 15000 peo
ple who will hear the man who
has forced' the ministry to not
only endorse his merhods, but to
get busy when he is around and
assist in whooping things up in
a way entirely new in revival
efforts. The money which will
be paid voluntarily to the only
one of his kind in existence to
day, will be considerable and of
course lessen contributions to
worthy causes after he departs
with it, but, that there will be
many reprobates who win be
called on to halt and who will
haltfora time at least; that there
will be scores who will feel much
benefited by his discourses as
coarse as they are; that some
who will "hit the trail" will
travel along the route they have
been induced to take for a time
and to that extent be benefited,
there is tittle doubt from the re
ports coming from cities where
Sunday has performed. There
is no sort of comparison between
Billy Sunday and Sam Jones nor
can it be hoped that even the
slight degree of permanency
which characterized the effect
of the teaching of Sam Jones be
attained by Sunday, but for all
this, it may be worth to the city
what it will cost, for Kansas
City certainly needs shaking up
if only for a few weeks.

"IF"
. t
A Poem by Rudyard Kipling
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
If you can trust yourself when all doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting, too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting
Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good nor talk too wise;
If you can dream and not make dreams your master;
If you can think-and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with triumphs and disaster
And treat these two imposters just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truths you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken
And stop to build 'em up with wornout tools;
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose and start again aj your beginnings,
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heartf and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the will to say to them "Hold on!"
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with kings nor lose the common touch;
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;
If all men count with you, but none too much.
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds worth of distance run,
Yours is the earth and everything that's in it,
And which is more you'll be a man, my son.
Huss and Hamp
Saturday night while await
ing tonsorial decorations, Louis
Huss and Hamp Drew disagreed
on some subjects and not desir
ing to extend the argument in
the. shop,mHamp, retired to tha
outside and took up a position
near the door. As Huss emerg
ed, Hamp landed lightly. Huss
countered another swing and
bumped into the premier coal
miner with his left. A consider
able jag was in the way of Hamp
maintaining his perpendicular
and he rolled over and nearly
under a bridge across the gutter.
Once down is not out for Hamp
and after locating his opponent
by the sound of his voice which
could be heard for blocks, Hamp
squared away again and pre
pared to land both dukes in rapid
fashion when he noticed some
thing intervening, just what he
could not focus on instantly, and
by the time he had made out the
situation, the intervening object
had led his opponent to the trail
leading homeward. The same
peacemaker whispered a few
soothing words to the effect that
since there was do dirt on his
back, he, Hamp, had not been
downed as he contended he had
been by a bludgeon which he
distinctly remembered seeing in
the hands of the aforesaid Huss.
However, he was persuaded to
admit that he had looked too
low and that the stick was one of
Huss'slegs instead of a shelaly
in his hands and that settled it;
Hamp soothed himself further
with another potion and turned
his attention toother important
matters.
Bob Simpson Champion
The Bosworth boy won for
Missouri at the big Pennsyl
vania meet last week, doing the
low hurdles 120 years in 15 sec
ondsflat and equaling the record,
tie did not go taster to win or
he might have broken the record
by a good fraction at least
Be it understood that Bob
deated the cracks from the larg
est colleges in this country, and
we all feel as proud of his
achievement as do his home peo
ple. Simpson has a rep for
knowing : something about his
studies as well as jumping gates
on the its. v
Bartlett Closing Exercises
Thursday evening last week the
Barlett Agricultural and Indus
trial Schooi, Supt. N. C. Bruce,
Dalton, closed the years educa
tional effort of the faculity and
pupils with a nne.program at
the Girls Building on the farm.
Not only the extension of
work as facilities are added, but
a noticeable improvement in
every respect is gradually being
brought about by Supt Bruce.
One of his pupils won the prize
for good manners and behavior
over the Cooper county contest
ant The prize each year is
known a3 the Jennings Medal
ana tne now happy possessor is
Talmadge Buchanan of the Bar
lett School.
Many of the farmers of the
Dalton neighborhood were pres
ent to witness the closing exer
cises and the celerity and accur
acy which was displayed by the
pupils in field and stable accom
plishments by the boys and the
cooking exhibition, laundry and
scrubbing by girls was as much if
not more interest to them than
the literary and musical part of
the program.
Prof. Bruce may well be proud
of his accomplishments, and we
know that as equipment is added
and facilities increased, he will
make progress proportionately
and we extend all the encourage
ment to him we can muster up.

The Pool Hall Question
Presiding Judge W. N. Hamil
ton and associate Judze J. W.
Hughes desire that the public
know why they granted a li
cense to run a pool hall in this
city to W. P. Thrash, and since
the Courier is the best medium
by which to reach all the people,
its editor was requested by these
gentlemen to make the follow
ing explanation.
The court had refused to grant
icense for such purpose and ex
pected to adhere to that stand
until Kansas City Court of Ap
peals passed on a case wherein
it was held by the county court
that the court had jurisdiction
over questions of what was good
and what was not good for a
community, and a license was
refused by the Clinton Co., court
to an applicant on the ground
that pool halls were not good in
stitutions to have running in a
community. The Kansas City
Court of Appeals held that a
county court had no authority to
pass on such questions. The
aw says that the county court
has the right to look into and
determine the character of an
applicant for a pool hall license .
and grant or refuse a license on
its finding.
Judge Herring decided that
the court had a right to act from
its information concerning the
character of an applicant and on
his part objected to the issuance
of the license in question. Judges
Hughes and Hamilton were as
sured that the court had no dis
cretion in the matter since the
decision by the court of appeals,
and influenced by the opinion of
the lawyers in the case and also
further moved by the attitude of
the city council and mayor, these
gentlemen, upon solemn assur
ances that the conduct of the
icensee would be closely looked
after and any deviation from the
requirements of the law govern
ing such matters on his part,
would be at once followed by
revocation of the right to con
tinue the pool hall and prosecu
tion, whereon they voted to
grant the license. They find,
they claim, that it is now too
late to rectify the mistake they
made in following incorrect ad
vice.
Judge Hughes does not go so
far as to announce that the
court will issue a license only
on a mandamus but that he
will have to be thoroly satisfied
that the applicant is a proper
person from every stand point to
conduct a business of this kind
before he will give his consent.
Judge Herring stands on the
record of the applicant being
satisfactory.
The public and any who may
desire to engage in the pool and
billiard hall business will now
understand the attitude of the
court on the subject and criti
cism for the former action of
Judges Hamilton and Hughes
should cease for the reason that
they relied on opinions of others
who were supposed to know and
of Judge Herring for his position
because he was right in his un
derstanding of his authority.
A La Italienne
The intinerant Italian three
piece orchestra when in town
last week attracted more than
usual attention from some on
account of the dreamy eyes and
cute ways of the principal tamala.
One of the young rhymesters
about town scribbled the follow
ing doggerel on the subject;
"We love to hear that Italian
play.
We would die if he stays
away.
Some good looking guy we
say.
We love him any old day.
We can't; we wont oh my;
Don't you see why?
We simply wont lie.
If it kills, we die.
Great Scott; talk about Scott;
Why not about the I-tahan?
Other things on our mind.
Be kind, since he has left
this town behind."
