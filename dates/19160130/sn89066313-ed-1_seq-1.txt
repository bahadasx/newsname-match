SMOKED GLASSES UP!
ECLIPSEJSJUE HERE
Sun Will Be Partially Ob
scured for Columbians
Thursday Morning.
TO LAST 10 MINUTES
Shadow Will Move at Rate
of 3,600 Miles an Hour:
So Hurry!
'let out your smoked glasses, our
colored glasses and telescope. You'll
need them next Thursdaj, if you
want lo look at the sun's eclipse. A
paitial obscuring of the sun will be
visible here February ::. from S:.r.l a.
m. until 10: 17 a. in.
Smoked or colored glasses and a
pair of ejes are all that are necessary
to see the eclip.se. Of com so, one may
look through the telescope if a dark
glass is placed over the eye-piece. If
you would see a picture of the eclipse,
let tlie sun focus itself through a pin
hole in a large cardboard and shine
on a white paper in a darkened room.
The shadow will show the crescent
shaped sun, the rest of it being cut
away by the moon's circle.
An eclipse of the sun is caused by
the moon passing between the sun and
the earth. That part on the earth
which is beneath the moon as it pass
es between the earth and sun is in
total darkness for a short space of
time. A total eclipse never lasts more
than seven minutes at any one place.
The "totality" strip Thursday will be
about a hundred miles wide and will
extend from a point in the Pacific
Ocean through the Republic of Colom
bia and the edge of Venezuela into tlie
Atlantic Ocean and nearly to England.
The shadow will move at a rate of
about CO miles a minute.
Total Eclipse Xcar Here in l!MS.
The next total eclipse whose trail
will be near Missouri will be in Jan
Mary, litis. It will extend from Den
ver to Jackson, Miss.
Astronomers all over the world take
advantage of the opportunity which
in eclipse affords of studying the sun's
atmosphere. Thursday they will be
stationed along the eclipse's path in
the northern part of South America.
The moon will completely hide the
sun. but the corona surrounding the
sun will be visible.
If there are only a few spots on the
sun, long wings will be shot out from
the corona; on the other hand, if there
are many spots; the corona will be
circular. The corona itself is white,
but the wings appear as red Haines.
In these sun-eclipse studies, astrono
mers have discovered a new element,
found nowhere else, which they have
named 'Voronium." It is much rarer
than any known gas.
As seven minutes is the greatest
length of time of an eclipse at any
point, the astronomer must work rap
idly and see much. The last total
eclipse took place just at the begin
ning of tlie Kuropean war. Every as
tronomer stationed along its course
in Russia experienced much difficulty
in getting back to their native land."
"Raj lime Dark" Terrorized Chickens.
The last total eclipse seen in Mis
souri was in 1S7S. Old-timers tell
that chickens sought their roosts and
that many persons prepared them
selves for the end of the world. Rut
the sleep of the chickens and the fears
of the superstitious were both short
lived, for tlie totality of tlie eclipse
was only two minutes.
If one were to believe in the adage,
"a rolling stone gathers no moss" and
if he lived to the good old age of 330
years, he very likely would see but
one total eclipse in his life, for ordi
narily these eclipses visit a community
an average of only once during that
length of time.
The partial eclipse next Thursday
will be the only eclipse visible in Co
lumbia tliis year, but there will be a
partial eclipse of the moon July 14, ex
tending five minutes past midnight.
