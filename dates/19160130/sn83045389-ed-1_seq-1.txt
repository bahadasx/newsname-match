OYSTER LAWS ARE IN DOUBT
House Declines to Review Work

Kullor's free sehoolbook I>f 11. ami the
measure cifs now to tin* Senato for
concurrence Tin- hill was sharply
fought wlit-n it way oil the calendar
??ii its second readinu. but opposition
which has liven cx|iccte?l yesterday
failed to materialize.
The hill provides that whenever 2.">
per cent of the electorate of aiif school
district In the State shall potH ion the
trustees for the Introduction of free
textbooks, then the electoral hoard of
such district shall call an election on
the question, and if a majority of the
voters vote for free schoolbooks. it 1
shall become the duty of the Hoard of
Supervisors to provide them.
In the sani' manner, it is provided.
? in entire county may as a unit vote on
the free sehoolbook issue, and hv a
majority vote of the electorate direct
the Hoard of Supervisors to carry out
the will of the people. The act does
?1 ? ? t appl> to cities and towns. Ail
amendment provides that the law shall
not apply to districts where the school
term j? less than seven months long, 1
and another amendment provides that j
tlie free schoolbook plan, once adopted, j
ma> he ali.niik it by the vote ?-f a ma

Following a sharp debate. Ihe House j
rejected b> a vote of 40 to T. t a resolu- !
tion introduced by Dele Rat e (iordon, of
l.oul^a, calling upon the clerk of the
Supreme Court of Appeals to furnish
Die House with a statement showing
i lie number of writs of err?>r granted
and tiie number denied where corpora-)
i ions were the plaintiffs in error, with- j
in the last live years: the same in- j
formation where individuals or part
y neiships wore plaintiffs in error: the'
number of reversals in favor of cor- ;
potations and in favor of individuals or ;
partnerships; and the number of writs)

" . niai cases durlttu the past five years. |
<* Peleuate l.eedy attacked the resolu
tion as a reiloction on the Court of
Appeals. ami Delegates Rrowning,
Howies, White and Jordan joined iiij
opposing it. The patron replied that]
lie had no intention of retlceting on j
the court, but thought that the informa
'? tiou asked for would assist the members',
in passing on the advisability of ma'.:ing
the .indues of the Supreme Court of
Appeals elective by the people. A reso-j
lulion looking to an amendment of the;
Constitution to this end is now pending
before the House. The body defeated j

Misgivings as to the constitutionality!
of the substitute bill reported by the'
Committee on the Chesapeake and Its
Tributaries, repealing the seed-oyster>
law, but vesting the Commission of
Fisheries with the power to declare
It aupin in force when conditions Justify
it, led Chairman Hew, of this commit
tee. to Introduce a resolution yesterday j
calling upon the Attoruey-Cencral to
advise the House on this point.
[.awyer members of the House hnvej
expressed Ihe fear that the substitute J
bill vests the Commission of Fisher!es|
with legislative functions. The Con-'
stitutlon provides that the legislative!
power shall be exercised exclusively nyj
ihe (icnetal Assembly. The same ques-;
tinn of constitutionality arises in con-!
i,potion with the bill repealing the1
present law fixing the cull line in the!
.lames River, which gives the Commis-j
sion of Fisheries the power to restore
the present cull line when, in its Judg-,
ment. such a step is demanded. Roth I
hills have been reported, and are now
on the House calendar. Action on them i
will be deferred until the Attorney-,
ijcnernl renders his opinion.

"Will it he necessary to call a s;>ori;i]

The defect. according to Mr. Pollard,
lies in tlie section which provides that
the new charter, framed by the com
mission for which provision is made, i
shall become operative if approved by!
a majority of the ?|n:t 1 i(1 oiI voters par- |
ticipating iti the election held for this
purpose.
Following the specific instruct ions' of
the (."han? r-("hanae Committee on 11- <
point. Mr. Pollard submitted a draft
embodying the provision just noted.
The question of by what vote the
special form of aovcrnnient sliall be
ratified was not discussed hy tin com
mittee. that body ratifying without
debate the Civic Association's recom
mendation on thi.s point.
The number of qualified electors, it
is clear, will always be much larger
than the. number of voters participating
in any one election, and the failure of
the hill to conform to the constitu
tional provision, it is held, would,
therefore, render >1 inoperative, even if
it were passed. Approximately 12,500
men are qualified to votu in Richmond, j
Under section 117 of the Constitution,
a majority of these, or more than t;.2."i0. t
would have to vote for the new charter
to carry it. Ordinarily, not more than .
S.000 voters participate in local elcc
t Ions.

Mr. Pollard, in his communication to
Senators Cannon and Wendenburg, sets ;
forth the circumstances surrounding
the drafting of the provision in ques
tion. His opinion, he writes, was not :
invoked as to the legality of the pro
vision. nor was any opinion given by
him which held that the proposed bill
would be tinconsiitutional by reason of
its failure to conform to section 117.
"Whether. under these circuni-j
stances." Mr. Pollard concludes, "you
should make the bill conform to the
Constitution or not, is a matter fori
your good judgment, but it seems to
me that, inasmuch as the bill must be
inoperative unless made to conform to
the Constitution, and that it is incon
ceivable that I he Civic Association ]
would intentionally propose an uncon
stitutional measure, and that the Coun
cil would knowingly ask llie adoption
of an unconstitutional measure, that
you may, with propriety, either request
further instruction from the Council
of the city of Richmond in the premises, '
there being, iu my judgment, ample]
time to obtain a response to such re- j
<iuest. or yourself amend the bill so as ;
to make !t conform to the Constitu
tion."

The Tiedevar Iron Works was taken
under militate control f..i the purpose
of maiiufacturinu munitions of war for
the Southern arm> and navy. Jt was
at this plant that a larvre part of tho
lamtnunition and ordnance used by the
South was manufactured. The Merrim# ?
<\ irviniai. the Confederate rani, was
overhauled and outlitted at the Trede
gar plant.
Iron, which was. essential in tj^o
j ma mi fact u te. of ordnance and shelhs
was in ffreal demand. The sources of
supply from the Xortli and from for
eijjn nations were out of the question
because ..f the effective blockade by
sea. The government was compelled
to rely on the supply of iron ore in the
\ alley ..f Virginia. The ore had to be
smelted and worked into bars and then
shipped to Kichtnond. Mr. HIuskow,
the uuiet yonnjr manager, was selected
lot the task. His uncle, knowing lliw
capabilities of bis younir associate,
would not listen for an instant to his
Koinv into the army. lie was more
useful as superintendent of (he blast
furnaces that supplied the South wilh
the necessary and vitally needed metal.
At that lime Iron was to the South

to tin- northeast of Netiville. in the
Artois region.
The attacks resulteil. according to
Iterlin, ill sweeping gains in hotli cases,
the village of Frise ami l.i'O" vards of
trt'iii'hes south of it being taken in the
more southerly sector. while in the
Netiville region l.Jirtu yards of trenches
were stormed, the pains amounting to
nearly a mile and a half of front. In
cidentally, more than l.imi prisoners
and twenty-two machine nuns were
ta k en.
The French account of the lighting
south of the Somnic diners materially
from that piven liy Tterlln. It is de
clared that the Hermans failed in their
attack, except on the hank of the
Soinme, where they were aide to drive
' a detachment of French troops out of
