Danger in Mind and Bids People
Cast Aside Partisan Feeling
When Considering Problem.
CLK\ l-LAXD. January 29 ?
President Wilson, speaking as. liesaid.
"solemnly." warned the nation
tonight that the time may
come when he cannot both keep
the United States out of war and
maintain its honor, lie declared
that the country must he prepared
to defend itself and prepared
at once. '
"America is not afraid of anybody."
he said. "I know 1 reflect
your feeling and the feeling of
all of our citizens when I say the
only thing I am afraid of is not
being ready to perform my duty.
1 am afraid of the danger of inadequacy
: I am afraid of the danger
of not being able to express
the chief character of this coun-j
try with tremendous might and
effectiveness whenever we are 1
called upon to act in the field of
the world's affairs."
Speaks With Hore Gravity.
Tie President spoke in Cleveland
tonight with inore gravity and force
than he has shown during any of his
l>revious addresses on preparedness.
He was applauded f reriuently. and
when he spoke of defending the -nation's
honor the cheering was tremendous.
"Let rne tell you very solemnly you
cannot postpone this thing." he de- i
< ared. "I do not know what a single !
day may bring forth I do not wish to !
leave you with the impression that I
am thinking t.f some particular danger. .
"I merely wish to tell you that we !
are daily treading amid intricate
dangers. The dangers that we are
treading among are not of our own j
making and not under our control I
think rio man in the United States
knows what a single week, a single
day, a single hour may bring forth."
Dwells on "Nation's Honor.**
A;.: in and again the President snnk-e
of the nation's honor. He declared the
real man btHieves his honor is clearer
than Lis life and a nation's honor Is
dearer than its peace and comfort. He
said had been difficult to keep the
I t. ted States out of the war and he
f- It he had proved he was a man of
peace when possible.
Regret that the question has come
up hi a campaign year was expressed
by Mr. Wilson.
"bet us forget." he said, "that this
is t year of national elections." The
]>r?-p;'redness issue, he added, should
have nothing to do with politics.
For the first time during his present
t ?ur the President spoke of the navy
and of the coast defenses. The lafif.
he said. are good in quality hut
not in quantity.
Son.*- people say that the navy ranks
second, he declared, hut the experts
agree it ranks fourth. He added it
should he increased.
Possible Sources of Danger.
Among the possible sources of danger
mentioned by the President were
the difficulties growing out of the protection
of Americans abroad and the
obligation of the I'nited States to
maintain the liberties of the people of
the western hemisphere.
The President's special rolled into
Cleveland in a downpour. The heavy
tain, howewr, did not deter tens of
thousands from standing patiently
along the mile or more from the station
to trie hotel. They cheered him
as he appeared .'.sale the heavy double
i onion ??r n, t *s si retdied round
the static*:. and applauded him ail
alotr; tli#* route
Traffic was Virtually at a standstill
along tin* line chosen h> the party.
After dining at the hotel the President
and Mrs. Wilson drove between
sidewalks black with umbrellas to the
armor>. There a crowd of 3,000 had
been awaiting him for more than an
hour. Many were turner! away.
To give them an opportunity to hear
him, the President decided to address
an overflow meeting from a balcony
of his hotel.
Is Greeted Enthusiastically.
The President entered the hall at *;3G
amid long and deafening aplause, and
soon thereafter began to speak. He sat
down to still the applause, but the
j handclapping and cheering continued.
Again, when the President was introduced
the crowd cheered.
The necessity for quick action was
made tlie keynote of the President's
preparedness addresses in Pittsburgh
and Cleveland on this the first day
of a week's tour of the middle west.
He told of difficulties encountered in
tr.-.i i tita i ii in sr the neace and unhnlHinu
the honor of the I'nited Statin at the
same time. Two thing**, he said, were
told hint hy almost every one who

that the people were counting on him
to keep them out of war, and in the

N '
I XKW YORK. January _>Q.?An
external explosion, probably
caused by a mine, disabled the
Holland-America liner Ryndam
off the Hnglish coast somewhere
between Deal and Falmouth, on
her way from New York to Rotterdam.
according to officers of
the Rotterdam, a sister ship,
which arrived here tonight.
The Rotterdam was at Falmouth
at the time the Ryndam
met with her accident, and the
officers of the former vessel said
they were informed that .a mine
! undoubtedly caused the explosion.

Confirm Stories of Secrecy.
Officers and passengers on the Rotterdam
confirmed the stories which
reached here by cable in regard to the
extraordinary precautions taken by the
English authorities to prevent details
of the mishap to the Ryndam from
becoming known. They said, however,
that it was common gossip at Falmouth
that three bodies had been removed
from the crippled liner.
When the Rotterdam reached Falmouth
she was boarded by British navy
officers, who took ashore Alexander
Kapper. a second-class passenger.
Kapper was permitted to return after
being questioned for several hours by
the British authorities. In the Downs
the Rotterdam was held up by a British
patrol ship and all Herman mail removed.
Ford Voyagers Return.
Sixty-seven members of the Ford
peace expedition came home on the
Rotterdam. Most of them had prepared
statements of their views on the
expedition, and these statements were
; distributed among the newspaper men
i who boarded the steamer at quar'
antine. "Autocratic leadership" was
j blamed by most of the voyagers for
j the lack of success that attended their
! enternri.se.
| State Senator Helen Robinson of
j Denver asserted that "certain ideas
| fostered by leaders of the party and
which they attempted to impose on the
delegation created discord." Although
the mission did not measure up to its
j ideal, she said, it "helped to mobilize
, the idea of peace in four Kuropean
j neutral nations, and showed those peo|
pie that the Fnited States is not, as
jthey have been led to believe, a buzj
zard nation."
Mrs. Inez Milholland Boissevain, who
. lei"' the expedition at Stockholm, de|
dared that while the motive and intenj
tion of the mission was sincere, it was
I a failure because ;t was .an autocratic
rather than a democratic organization."
Bernstein Charges Blunder.
Herman Bernstein, the author, who
; also left the party at Stockholm, said
1 an important blunder was made when
i members of the party were virtually
; fon ed in a humiliating manner to sign
a pledge declaring their opposition to
President Wilson's policy yf national
defense." lie joined with the other
members <>f the party in giving credit to
Henry Ford for undertaking the mission.
While at Falmouth the Herman and
Austrian passengers on '.lie Rotterdam
were subjected to a rigid examination

i Among ttie passengers on board was

Death and Desolation in Otay Valley
From Broken Dam May Now
Be More Than Equaled by
Cloudburst Disaster.
SAX D1FGO, Cal.. January 29
(by wireless to San Francisco).?
One hundred lives have been
lost, as nearly as any estimate can
show, and charming little valleys
for fifty miles north of the Mexican
line lie desolate tonight from
floods and cloudbursts.
, With the death toll in the Otay
valley seemingly established at
fifty, and all relief agencies working
in that direction, reports
reached here late today of floods
sweeping the San Luis Rey and
San Pasqual valleys, doubling the
loss of life. With communication
almost altogether cut off. it was impossible
to list accurately the f
number of dead; conjectures and f
meager reports alone were available.
Seventeen Bodies From Bay.
Seventeen bodies were taken out of
San Diego bay before nightfall. These
had been swept down the Otay river a
when the lower dam went out late ^
Thursday, and the current of the flood
was thought to have carried many
others out to sea.
The town of San Diego is virtually
undamaged and supplementary resources
are available to replace its
regular water supply, cut off by the
breaking of the dam.
cc
Town Completely Wiped Out. eJ
Many injuries were reported from si
Tikuana Dot Springs, where a hotel b'
collapsed. A cloudburst, reports had it, >'<
caused the flooding of the San Luis ei
Rey and San 'Pasqual valleys. The tc
town of San Pasqual, an ancient vil- tl
lage. cuddled in the mountains in a ol
fertile valley, was said to have been tl
wiped out altogether. in
Nothing was known as to the fate of la
the towns of San Luis Rey and Oceanside,
in the path of the San Luis river, ^
but if the flood was of the reported
magnitude, it seemed Impossible that
the former could have escaped anni- w
hilation. Oceanside is a summer re- w
sort, with two good sized hotels and a
population of about 1,000. The San Luis
Key valley contains one of the great .
Miller and Lux cattle ranches, which
dot the state for 700 miles and are
known to cattlemen throughout the
world.
Expedition FTom Warships.
A
Railroads, highways, telephone, tele- tj
graph?all ordinary means of communication
and relief were gone, with no
prospect of early recovery. Only the ja
sea remained, and from it aid began to w
come. An expedition from the I'nited 0)
States warships in San Diego bay was
started in launches and barges for the y
Otay valley. Reports were that the y
first landing party had been unable to ti
penetrate the valley, for ^reasons not T
1 given. The destroyer Lawrence moved
down from her station here and anchored
off the mouth of the Otay river,
which stream ran bank full after being
dry for years. ?
Overland Relief Party. ^
I An overland expedition also was started
from San Diego, with pontoons and en(
gineering equipment, by which it was t
hoped swollen streams might be crossed i?
I and mired roads made passable. No word a
came as to its success. S
No one here knew tonight what was
going on in the outside world, even as
? near as lx>s Angeles. The wireless, the f)
sole means of communication, except by g
. boat, could not begin to handle the busl.
. tiess offered -?r even the press dispatches.
It was impossible to estimate ^
. the amount of relief work, to be done, ir
1 because no word from the stricken val- a
t leys conveyed any idea of the number
i or plight of the .survivors. ?
First Reports of Disaster. ^
First reports of the Otay disaster c
. reached here late Thursday. They told y
i of ranch houses washed away, and of w
? cattle and stock drowned. Investiga- tl
* tlon appeared to indicate exceptionally a
' high water, and word came that the

human bodies, with a frightful amount it
of wreckage, including hundreds of rat- u
tlesnakes from the mountainsides, en- p
tahlished, seemingly beyond all doubt,
the collapse of the ram. From no other

PARIS. January 30. 12:30 a.m.
Germans have resumed their

conds later about a dozen
imbs fell in different sections of

FF.TROGRAD. January 29. via
London.?The Russian Caucasian
operation is widening, fanlike, to
the westward, south westward
and southward with the j>ossibility,
according to semi-official .
opinion, of a juncture being
formed with the British Mesopotamia!!
expedition.
The advance of the Russian
column south of Hamadan leaves
but a comparatively short dis- j
tance between the Russian and
British forces in the two theaters
of war. Although the country
between is broken and mountainous.
Russian military observers
take the view that the Turks
fear a junction of the two armies
and are taking measures to protect
their lines against such an
eventuality.
Russians in Advances.
The Russian advance is pushing: west
of Mehrxgrhert, where the important
town of Khynysskala. fifty miles south
of Erzerum, has been captured. At
the same time progress is reported in
the direction of Van and likewise
toward Urumiah, where it is officially
announced that the Turks have been
repulsed with heavy losses. Further
southeast, in the region of the Kandalanski
pass, southeast of Hamadan, another
Russian victory is reported.
North of Dumlu Dagh, a chain of
mountains in the region of Erzerum.
Turks were dislodged by Grand Duke
Nicholas' forces, while an attempt of
the Moslems to advance in the upper
Passine valley, east of Erzerum, la
said to have been futile.
Junction Is Feared.
That the Turks fear a junction of
the Russians and British is indicated
by the retreat toward Mush of a large
part of their army that was recently
reported to have been routed, the evident
purpose of the move being to
cover Bitlis and Piarbekar. It is admitted
that the recent successes of
the Russians in the Caucasus operations
are thus far not of great strategic
importance, but are regarded as
having a notable moral effect upon the
Turkish troops, which, military observ|
ers point out. readily stampede in an
j open campaign.

| By flanking Erzerum, a fortress regarded
by the Turks as an effective
barrier between the Caucasus and
I Asiatie Turkey, Col. Shumsky. military
jcritic of the Birzheviya Vedomosty,
says the Russians achieved a master
stroke, which seriously threatens that
stronghold.
The Erzerum fortifications, the critic
explains, are a straight line of forts,
extending twenty-four miles along a
ridge intersecting all important roads
from the Caucasus. Under German
direction the Turks constructed new
forts to the right and left of the old
fortifications. Without a formidable
base from which to attack. Col, Shumsky
says, the Russians took Metazgh^rt
and Khvnysskala without opposition
from Erzerum. The only explanation
he suggest^ is that the Turks were too
badly demoralized by the blow, which
caused them to fall back on Erzerum
to rally to the opposition. The Turks
who retreated toward Musb are cut off
from the fortress.
"The strategic 'meaning of this advance
along the whole Caucasus front."
says Col. Shumsky. "is that we are
gradually approaching the British
forces in Mesopotamia, and although a
meeting cannot be expected in the near
future, the mere fact of its possibility
immediately opens new and important
strategic phases."
Indian Troops Arrive.
LONDON, January 1*9.?A dispatch today
from the British press representative
with the British forces in the Persian
gulf district contained the announcement
that the Indian troops
which left Flanders several weeks ago
are now in Mesopotamia.
Lieut. Gen. Sir Percy Lake, who recently
took over the supreme command
of the British forces in Mesopotamia,
succeeding Gen. Sir John Eccles Nixon,
has, according to an official announcetnined
the relief expedition under
Gen. Aylmer at Wadi. He reports that
the weather continues bad and the
whole country is deep in mud. making ?
the movement of troops very difficult.
