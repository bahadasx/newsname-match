PERIENCE HAS TAUGHT FAL
LACY OF OVER-PRODUCTION.
The secretary of the chamber of
commerce in another column has set
forth in an article on the world's cot
ton supply some interesting figures
that should cause the farmers through
out the entire cotton belt to heed anil
refrain from increasing their acreage
another year. The farmers through
out this section of the state have learn
ed long ago that their only salvation
was in diversification and they have
been gradually getting away from cot
ton, according to a statement from
jne of the largest land owners in this
section while commenting upon local
conditions yesterday, and he has been
encouraging all his tenants to raise
less cotton and more feed stuffs, hogs
and cattle with the result that today
he has a class of tenants on his farm
who are permanent, good farmers, and
are gradually accumulating enough to
purchase land of their own. "Carter
county is In good financial condition
today," remarked this man, "not from
the fact that a big cotton crop was
raised, but in spite of It. Farmers are
raising more to maintain their fami
lies in the way of hogs, cattle and
poultry and are keeping out of the
stores, in fact are selling something
instead of buying, and when this con
dition universally prevails throughout
liiis section, there will be no such a
thing as hard times."

man is candidate for vice president of
