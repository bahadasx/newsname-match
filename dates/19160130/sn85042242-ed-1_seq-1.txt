Cannot Postpone It.
The preHideut was applauded fre­
quently tuid when speaking of the na­
tion's honor, the cheering was tre­
mendous.
"Let me tell you very solemnly you
cannot postpone this thing," he de­
clared. "I do not. Know what a single
day may bring forth. 1 do not wish to
leave you with the impression that I
am thinking of some -particular dan

•i .. Treading in Danger.
•"I merely wish to tell you that we
are daily treading amidst intricate
danger. The dangers that we are
treading among afe H6t of our own
making atuj not under our control.
1 think n6" lnan Jn the United States
knows what" a single week, a single
day, a single hpur, may bring forth."
Nation's Honor.
Again and again the. president
spoke of the nation's honor. He de­
clared that real man believes his
honor is dearer than his life, and a
nation's honor is dearer than its
peace and comfort. He said it had
been diflic'ult to keep the United
States out of war and he felt he haa
proved he was a man of peace when
possible.
Time Unfortunate.
Regrets that the question has come
up in a campaign year was expressed
hy Mr. Wilson.
"Let us* forget," be said, "that this
is a year of national election."
The preparedness issue he said
should have nothing to do with poli­
tics.
For tiie first time during his pres­
ent tour, the president spoke of the
navy and of the coast defenses.
The latter, he said, are good in qual­
ity, but not in quantity.
iNavy Ranks Fourth.
Some people say that the navy
ranks second, he declared, but the
experts agree it ranks fourth. He
added it should be increased.
Our Responsibilities.
Among the possible sources of dan­
ger mentioned by the president were
the difficulties growing out .of the
protection of Americans abroad and
the obligation of the United States to
maintain the liberties of the western
hemisphere.
President Wilson arrived here to­
night after delivering two addresses
in Pittsburg, one of which was to a
large overflow crowd.
In these two addresses, the presi­
dent spoke of the new circumstances
which have arisen and which makes
it absolutely necessary that this coun­
try should prepare for adequate na­
tional defense.
Must Be Ready for Trouble.
"I should feel that I was guilty of
unpardonable omission, if I did not
go out and tel my fellow countrymen
that new circumstances have arisen
which make it adequately necessary
that this country prepare herself for
war, not for anything that smacks in
the least of aggression- but for ade,
quate national defense.
America's improvident neglect to
build merchant- ships, the president
.said in explanation, had left the coun­
try dependent on other nations to
carry its Commerce. The nations
How at war are all friends of Ameri­
ca, but preoccupied and stubbornly
steadfast' in the maintenance of their
main purpose.
Critical Controversy.
"Wlherever, the ordinary rules of
commerce at sea and of international
relationship are likely to be thrust
aBide or ignored," he continued,
"there is danger of the more critical
kind of controversy."

American Liner Was Bound
From New York to
Rotterdam.
BELGIANS STILL IN
DESTITUTE CONDITION
New York, Jan. 29.—The Holland
American liner, llyndam, which was
mysteriously disabled at sea while
bound from 'New York to Rotterdam,
was the victim of an explosion in the
boiler room that killed several per­
sons on board, according to reports
brought here today by passengers and
officers of her sister ship, the Norr
dam.
An explosion, probably caused by
an exploding mine, disabled the Hol
land-American liner Ryndam off the
English coast somewhere between
Deal and Falmouth on her way from
New York to Rotterdam, according to
officers of the Rotterdam, a sister
ship, which arrived here tonight.
The Rotterdam was at Falmouth at
the time the Ryndam met with her
accident and the officers of the for­
mer vessel said they were informed
that a mine undoubtedly caused the
explosion. Three members of the
Ryndam engine room force were kill­
ed and several injured, but none of
the passengers was hurt. The Ryn­
dam was able to make her way to
Gravesend.
The Norrdani reached (Falmouth on
her outward voyage on the same day
as the Ryndam was towed, disabled,
into the English port.
Officers and passengers on the
Norrdani confirmed the Btories which
reached here by cable in regard to
the extraordinary precautions taken
by the English authorities to prevent
details of the mishap to the Ryndam
from becoming known. They said,
however, that it was common gossip
at Faimouth that several bodies had
'been removed from the crippled liner.
Among the passengers on board the
"Norrdani was the Rev. C. N. Lathrop
of iMilwaukee, who has been engaged
in (Belgium relief work in Liege. Dr.
Lathrop said that 210 tons of flour
were being distributed each week in
Liege.
The wheat coming frofn America is
being ground by the Belgians. He
said there was great need of clothing
and that the people in this partic­
ular respect were so destitute that
the carpets had been ripped out of
the hotels and. made into shoes.
The NorrdSm encountered the
worst storm in her history on her trip
across. She was forced to put into
St. Johns, N. F., for coal.
"Frederick Sniffens and 41 other
members of the Ford expedition were
on board.

Immense
Deposits
In Banks
According to t'ic deposits in
the State and National banks in
this state, there is a per capita
deposit of $182. In other words,
if the deposits of the banks in
'North Dakota were equally divid
ed, every man, woman and child
in the state would get $182,
The total deposits in the banks
in this state aggregated $116,
062,023.00, according to the last
calls. The deposits of the 654
State banks and Trust companies
in the state aggregate $71,908,166,
while those in the 151 National
banks amount to $44,153,857, or
a grand total of $116,062,023. The
population of the state, according
to the best census figures pro­
curable, is 4536,643, making the per
capita deposit of the state $182.
This immense amount of money
is the best herald of "prosperity
the state can have. Never in the
history of (North Dakota have the
bank deposits been as large as
they are at the present time. The
eyes of the entire country are on
North Dakota today, and with the
horn of plenty fuN'to overflowing,
prosperity reigns supreme' on all
sides.
The United States is rich, con­
sidered the richest country in the
wolrd. The per capita deposit

Germans and Allies Claim That,
They Have Made Material
Gains.

London, Jan. 29.—The western war
front has been the scene of really
heavy lighting, the Germans having
launched a determined offensive
there.
After making in recent days sever­
al dents in the Allies' line, the Teu­
tons yesterday, after heavy bombard­
ment, assaulted the Allies' positions
south of the river Somme, and to the
northeast of Neuville, in the Artois
region.
Teutons Make Gains.
The attacks resulted, according to
Berlin, in sweeping gains in both
cases, the villages of Fryse and i,0uU
yards of trenches south of it being
taken in thet more southerly sector,
while. in the Neuville region 1,500
yards of trenches were stormed, t»ie
gains amounting to nearly a mile and
a half of front.
More than 1,100 prisoners and 22
machine guns were takeiu
The French accbuftf Wafils flglitflig"
differs materially from that given by
Berlin, declaring that the Germans
failed in their attacks, except on the
banks of the Somme, where they
drove a detachment of French troops
out of the village of Fryse. Paris
asserts that the attack has been
checked and that' some of the trench
es lost were recovered in the first of
the iFrench counter attacks.
British Claims.
In its account of the fighting in the
Artois region, the British war office
apparently refers to the operations
mentioned by Berlin as taking place
near Neuville, it being asserted that
a portion of 1 ho trenches occupied
yesterday by Germans were retaken.
Elsewhere than on the. Franco-Bel­
gian front,, there have been no im­
portant engagements recently, except
that in the Caucasus, where the Rus­
sians claim to have secured material
successes against the Turks.
Fetrograd again points to the pos­
sibility of the operation of the Rus­
sian Caucasus army being markedly
helpful to the British in Mesopota­
mia. Russian military observers take
the view that the Turks fear a junc­
tion of the two armies and are taking
measures to protect their lines
against: such an eventualty.
Activc In Albania.
In.the Balkans 'the Austrians con­
tinue to make progress in Albania,
reporting the occupation of Laesio
and San di Medua, on the Adriatic
coast.
In Montenegro calm prevails. Vien­
na now declares the capture of 314
canon, more than 50,000 rifles and 50
machine guns in the Montengrin op-i
eration.
An expedition of marines from
French, British, Russian and Italian
warships at daybreak Friday occu­
pied the Greek fort of Karabar over
the protest of the Greek commander,
according to Saloniki dispatches to­
day. The news caused great excite­
ment' in Athens, because it marked
the first appearance of Italian and
Russian armed forces on Greek soil.
On the eastern fronts there have
been only isolated engagements.
A Reuter's dispatch from Copen­
hagen says the Danish steamer Vidar,
bound from Copenhagen for British
ports with provisions, was seized to­
day off Elsinore by a German sub­
marine. The steamer was taken
southward, probably to Swienemuen
de.
The American steamer Moreni, from
