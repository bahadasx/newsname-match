SENATOR REED ONCE
Wahiiinoto.v, Jan. 29, The greatest
fe.ir that tho friends ot Louis D. llran
dels have, so far as tho light over the
continuation of his nomination is con
cerned, is caused by the threat that
charges Involving his professional con
duct will be formally brought In the
Senate.
There Is every reason to bellevo that
the charges will b brought, thus ne
cessitating a hearing ami long delay.
Sonio Senators have been made ac
quainted with these charges. At least
one member of the Judiciary Committee
has said that he would not vote for con
firmation until they were explained.
Homo of the charges have been laid
before Senators In anihlet form. They
wero made before llrandels'H name was
even considered for a Judicial place,

I'nlted Shoe Machinery Company, for
I which he once acted as attoriic) ; Ins re

Mr. llrandels as the result of the hit
ter's professional service to the I'nlted
Shoe Machinery Company.
The Colloquy In the Venule.
The following colloquy, which occurted
at the time In the Senate debate, may
be found In the Cnngrmstonnl llrconl on
pa.-e 13.9V.!, volume 11:
Senator Ketd (Pemorr.it, Missouri):
, "The Senator poke about the organ-
, fcatlon of these three compnnleM into one
company, which Is now the I'nlted Shoe
, Machinery Company (addressing Sena
tor Weclis of Massachusetts), 'Does the
' Senator hnow the name of the attorney
who worked out the legal problem! ot
' that consolidation?' "
Senator Weeks: "I presume there wan
mure than one attorney engaged in doing
tt. One. of the attorne, who was
for a long time a director of the com
pany, and who. I have understood, drew
the leases which have been In operation
i ever slme im Mr. Hrandeln."
Senator Heed : "That Is Louis D.
Urandtlti?"
Senator Weeks: "Yes."
I Senator Heed: "The reformer. 1
understand the Swiator to fiay that he
I understood Mr. Hrandeli had also drawn
1 the leases which this company has been
. ,
ll',tl'"
Senator Weeks : "I have been informed
that .Mr. lirandels drew the original
leases which the shoe convpany u-ed ami
which they are using to-day, substan
tially as they were originally drawn."
Mirrninn l.iuv Vlolntlnn,
Senator Iteed "The Senator spoke
this morning of the allegation upon
which the Oovernment Is now standing
In the suit against the shoe macnlrery
trust, -mil therefore 1 conclude he must
be familiar with that litigation. I want
to ak him if it is not a fact that one of
the main allegations in tho Government's
suits is that these contracts, which the
Senator says were drawn by Mr. llran
dels. arc violative of the Sherman act""
Senator Weeks: "The liovernmeut's
contention has been modified very ma
terlnl y since It was originally made but
5ovcrninent Is contending that the
''"I""1' "" Machinery Company Is a
ir nt su to (s.
I monopoly and has brought suit to
solve the monopoly "
Senator Iteed then read the contract
which tho Government had attacked as
the basis of the monopoly, and added :
"I understand that to be what is com
monly known as the tying clause of these
contracts. I understand that tying
clause Is the work of the legal Ingenuity
of Mr. llrandels. If I am able to Inter
pret it, It vests In this company the
nower to take out of a factory machinery
obtained from It which It has heretofore
uxil or which It Is now using; that no
matter how long the lease may run under
Its terms, no' matter what tho conditions
of the sale may have been, there Is
eted In this shoe machinery company
tho right to enter the premises where the
machinery Is installed and take It out If
I the lessor ventures to us any one of
these machines that are named which
I was not obtained from this company.
, I want to ask tho Senator If those facts
do not constitute one of the main grounds
of the attack by the Government to-day
In Its suit?"
Senator Weeks: "That Is one of the
grounds."
II model Contrai l AltilcLcil,
Senator Heed : "The Senator has stated
that Mr. llrandels drew this contract.
I want to ask tho Senator If this par
ticular form of contract was not at
tacked lu the Legislature of Massachu
setts and some legislation attempted to
make It Impossible to mako this kind of
a contract'.'"
Senator Weeks: "It was, Mr. Pres.

HIS HITTER CRITIC
Machinery Company, to the Hon. Calvin
D. I'alge, who represents the Fourth dis
trict of Massachusetts, who wnn a mem
ber of that committee, In which he
says, speaking of Mr. llrandels: 'Mr.
llrandels helped organize the United Hhoe
Machinery Company. Prior to 1S99 ho
was director of tho MacKny Shoe Ma
chinery Company, one of the non-competing
concerns from which our company
was formed, lie was ono of the llrst
directors of the United Shoo Machinery
Company, and one of Its legal advisers,
and as a lawyer he helped to draft the
leases lie now denounces. Assuming
that he felt then us he feels now that
the director of a company occupies a
fiduciary relation to Its stockholders
he must have believed himself respon
sible for the character ot our leases,
even If lie bad not helped to draw them J
yet throughout his association with our
company ho never criticised them, and
In 1906 be itpticnred before the Massa
chusetts Legislature to defend the cry
methods which he now attacks.' And
Inter In that letter Mr. Coolldgo says.
speaking of an opinion by hltn (llrandels)
to Charles 11. Jones, his client this Is
the quotation: 'The lease being Invalid
be cannot be liable for failure to per
form.' Kindlon of the !.ftw.
Senator Heed: "I wish to ak, after
the Massachusetts Ix-gkslaturei passed
th" bill which restricted the right to
make leases ot this character, ti thi.r
the Senator knows who it was devised
the plan to esonpe tho effect of that
law. the plan being simply to add a
clause giving a right to terminate the
lease the rlaue Indeed that 1 read
a moment ago. and under which the
proprietor of the machinery or lessor
of the machinery can go into a man's
factory the moment he puts In a ma
chine that lie did not make and take
out nil the machines that are there and
..lose down his business and ruin him?
I wlh to ask If the Senator knoAS
whether Mr. Ilranuels devised that
means of meeting tho statute of Mass
achusetts." Senator Weeks: "No. Mr. President,
1 have not any Information on that
subject." '
Senator Heed : "The Senator from
Massachusettes nan stated that Mr. I
llrandels did draw the contract of the
shoe machinery trust, lines the Sena
tor know at wluit time Mr llrandels
severed his connection with that con
cern as attorney or officer?"
Senator Weeks: ".Mr. President, In
that particular I have quoted what ! a
part of a public record In relation to
Mr. Hrandeis's association with the or
ganization. As an attorney for the
I'nlted Shoe company In UKoi he did ap
pear for the company before the Legis
lature. Mine that time he has been I
einplnje.l hy others than the Slme M i-
rhluor company, and he has publicly
attacked the laws which he Is supposed
to have had a ery potent hand In draw
ing "
Senator Heed: "Does the Senator
from Massachusetts know whether Mr.
llrandels had anything to do with insti
gating the litigation that Is now- pend
Ing and furnishing informitlon""
Senator Weeks "i hue no definite
details. Mr Piesiib-nt, but Mr. llrandels
has lopresented tho-e who have been
wry active In attacking the Shoe Ma
chinery companv, particularly Charles
II. Jones of the Commonwealth Shoe
Company of Massachusetts." '
Ilecaue of this and other attacks on
llrandels there Is keen Interest here In
tho attitude which Senator Heed may
assume.

that his Government would want as

With respect to tne course m no im -

to Count von llernstorff, who communi
cated It to his Government. The pr.-n'ii'
oontldentlal conversations between the
Secretary and the Ambassador would be
abruptly terminated At the same time
a new note, formal In character, would
be prepaied and forwarded to the Herlln
Foreign office through Ambassador
Gerard.
Such a note would be comparatively
brief and Inform the German Govern
ment thar the I'nlted States, disap
pointed over the unsuccessful out'-nnie of
the cinlldcnll.il negotiations, undertaken
at Germ.inj's reiiiest. and unable to

It can be -.laled authoritatively, how

Government appear to believe that theie
