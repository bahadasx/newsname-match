the casualties.

Three were hurled down from the
Zeppelin which made an attack at
midnight and exploded with deadly
force. Two were .dropped earlier In

[From the above it would appear
that two separate attacks were made
by the Germans, though the cable
despatch does not state whether one

[United Press Leased Wire Service]
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Jan. 29.—In a
stirring address before nearly 4,000
persons, packed In Gray's armory, to
night, President Wilson urged the peo
ple of the country to strengthen the
mllltlary defenses of the country in
order that he might maintain the hon
or of the country.
The president boldly asserted that
the United States is not afraid of any
nation, but that In case of national
peril, he feared for America because
of the inadequacy and Inefficiency of
the military arms of the country.
"Let me tell you gentlemen," the
president stated emphatically, "you,
can't afford to postpone auequate pre
paredness.
"I do not know what the next day
will bring. I do not mean to point
to any particular danger, but we are
being swept along in things over
which we have no control. No man
can say what the next day or the
next week may bring.
"You may count on me to keep you
out of the war, but you must help me
In maintaining the honor of the na
tion."
.• After the address to the Chamber
of Commerce members, the president
returned to his hotel, where nearly six
thousand persons had congregated. He
spoke a few words of appreciation, but
did not make a speech.
"I am a union man," said the presi
dent, "and I must not work over
eight hours a day."
He was roundly cheered.

SAN DIEGO, Calif., Jan. 29.—Out of

—came tonight reports that more
than a dozen bodies had been recov

was still estimated at fifty.
Fruitful orange and lemon groves,

Conflicting reports came late today
from various parts of the flooded area
regarding the number of bodies re
covered. Some placed the number at
eighteen. A dozen bodies were said
to have been found near the mouth
of the Otay river.
Alarming reports regarding the
situation at Tla Juana also came in.
One of these was that the flood
waters had swept over the entire dis
trict occupied by the Tia Juana race
track, destroying everything except
ing some of the stables on high
ground.
More than 1,000 feet of the Otay
dam was carried away when the
