rinvis, HiUi. Jan. 29 When the clock
chimes ii o'clock in the evening, two
days from the date this la written, n
.sish of relief will go up from the cit
izens of Clovis, as it will register the
close of election day and bring to an,
end the most tenaciously fought and,!
In many ways, the most bitter contest
ever waged here, political not barred. ;
for more than five weeks the citizens
of Clovis have I n in the throes of
a prohibition campaign, or one to de-j
termini if clovis shall he wet or dry
during the next four years. And, it,
may In said with all candor and sin-j
cerlty, that the majority of the cltM
sens are willing to allow thrice four,
years W elapse before resurrecting the I
issue as a strictly local one. Should
Statewide prohibition be brought up at i
any time in the future, that would be
1 different proposition; but no matter;
which way the election here goes to-1
morrOW it is safe to say that neither'
faction will care to bring the Issue up)
locally again for many years.
Hiifi the business interests of the;
ciiy been Consulted it is claimed that
the Issue would not have been brougluj
up at this time, aa the. consensus of!
opinion seems to be that it would have
been far better to have let well enough
alone. Not that the open saloon is
sanctioned or condoned by most of
1 hem, but tor the reason that business
is sensitive. It loean't tnke much to
disturb its equilibrium, ami as the:
town was going along in fine shape,
business would have preferred that

interruption, of course . matter
which way the election goes, condi
tions will soon adjust themselves
again. l:ut business would have bee"
much better mtlsfled if the interrup

Washington, Jan. 29. While Presi

his appeal for adequate national de
fense, one of the vital elements of the

and house military committees

tary Harrison as embodying the most
attractive scheme that could be de
vised to give a final test of the prob
