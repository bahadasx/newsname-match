a strong believer in the ultimate suc

raising in the Sulphur Spring valley
and cannot see why anyone can have
the blues over the prospects ahead for
Cochise county.
! Bids for Election Supplies
That the regular election is approach

Board of Supervisors are asking for
bids for the furnishing of the -supplies
that will be ued at both the primary

PETTY GRIME INCREASES
DUE TO MEXI-
material increase in
That th're is a
the commission of petty crime by Hex
icans since the war has stopptd in Sono I
ra is very evident. There have been
more cases of larceny and burglary
against Mexicans during the past few
weeks than for a number of months
Nearly all the burglary cases that havir
required the attention of the court dur
ing.tbe past few days have been of this
nature.
There is hardly a day passes that ;
the Sheriff office is not notified tha I
some place has been broken into anil
things stolen. The work is not that of
professional burglars as the articles
taken are usually clothes and small
articles, very little jewelry and silver
ware or things of that sort being taken.
Reports of this sort of thefts have
been received from Douglas. Bisbee,
Apache, Gleeson, Bowie and Benson
during the past ten days.
0. OF A. GETS $127,500
FROM TIMBER
SALES
niOENIX. Jau 29 Announcement
was made at the State Land Office this
week Of the sale of thirty-four million
feet of University timber to the Green
law Lumber Company, of Flagstaff.
The sale was made at the Coconino
county court house in Flagstaff by
State Land Commissioner W.A. Moeur.
The price paid was $3 75 per thousand
feet of lumber, board measure, making
a iotal of S127.500 to be turned over
to the University fund of the state.
The cutting of the timber will be
'done under the supervision of an ex
pert detailed from the government for
est service. The land upon which the
limber is to be cut is south and east of
Flagstaff, and was selected years ago
because it is one of the best sections
of timber to be found in the moun
tains. Back from Douglas
Mrs. Wo. Hughes roturned to Tomb

THE SHADE OF '84
OR
t Wh'n thr miners were stampeding
Like a buuch of lenderfeet,
'There was nothing parliamentary
When strangers chanced to meet.
And to get the folks together,
1 They did not advertise or boost
1 An especial "Rally Week."
To get them introduced.
For things were run wide open
, In thev-c good old times.
And the Hlite paid attention
To the muckers in the mines.
When Schieffelin was running things.
And hoarding up his pile.
Sure, ociity was social
In good old western style.
We were rather shy of Hi;h Brows,
1 In Auld Lang Syne,
t And the parsuus were equivalent -!
To the muckers in the mine.
i,
But tinal'y there cam: a change
In this little raining town,
I Society got cxclusne
And turned the muckers down.
The Big Buc, left the country
To enjoy their spoils of Fater
The I ittle Bugs organised a church.
And there did congrrgate.
They ostracired the muckers.
These select and chosen few.
And the boys refused to arbitrate
With the members of the pew.
The church was unconditional.
And the miners set their tines
So, soon there was an exit
Of the'SJuckers from the mines.
The Regime, a while, it prospered;
But alas, there came a day
When the miners go: disgusted.
And the muckers went away.
Tombstone had been a live one
Ere the Little Bugs held sway.
But it very sojn got grewsome
When the mines refused to pay.
Then the Deacons got to thinking
Of those good old times.
And the Trustees sure were missing
The muckers from the mints.
For a while they 'played the jury
tGod's mercy in their plight)
Alfred Henry Lewis boosted
With the stories be did write
The lungers came to Tombstone
For the scenery and air,
And thus their ailing brothers
Did provide their Bill of Fare
Thus between the sick and wicked
They managed to exist.
But they oft recalled gay Tombstone
And the miners they dismissed.
At last there came a parson.
With a mind of modern mold.
Who preached anew the Golden Rule
Against the Rule of Gold.
A strict Utilitarian,
A man of virtuous mind
Promoting the highest happiness
For all Mankind.
He preached to them about the "beam
Was suspicious of a "mot:;"
His text was ''Love Thy Neighbor."
Of which the Savior wrote.
He asked them to lift the "bushel"
That bad so dimmed their light.
And opposed the aged doctrine
That Might is more than Right.
It sure was education
To tbis Elite chosen band
To hear him eulogize
Those banished from the land.
He questioned ancient wisdom
Iu this neo-modern' light.
Of "the sheep upon the left
And the goats upon the right."

GLEESON MINES
REOPEN
WITH
FULL FORCE
OF MEN
Were Closed By Clifton
Strike; Furnish Flux
10" IJIg oincitcia
Word brought in this morning from
Gleeson, where the mines have been
closed during the long months of the
Clifton strike, is that the mines were
reopened yesterday and are now run
ning in full blast. A large force of
men has been put back io work pro
ducing the fluxing ort-s that ate so val
uable to the Morenci smelters of the
Shannon Copper Company.
The Copper Belle Company, of Glee
son. which is a subsidiary of the Shan
non, at Clifton, was ordered shut down
immediately after the strike was de
clared at Clifton and Morenci. While
the strike did not affect this section of
the country concerning the miners'
grievances, when the smelters closed
down the demand for the Gleeson ores
dropped off, and necessitating a shut
down. Gleeson reiidenW are rejoicing that
that the mines have been reopened,
which means several hundred men
given employment, and increased pros
perity. Several old employes who had moved
here returned to their old positions,
and in a few days the regular shipment
of fluxing ores will be going forward
to the smelters.
I AILS THE GAME
SUPPLY OF ARIZONA?
In commenting on the figures recent
ly published showing the dwindling
game supply of Arizona and New -Mex
ico, horest Ulliccrs say mat tlie situa
tion is so serious as to necessitate im
mediate and decisive action along the
following lines:
First, the prompt enactment of the
Chatnberlin-Haydon Bill now before
Congress emboding the Hornaday
Plan for a system of Game Refuges,
providing places where game can breed
unmolested and where there is no hunt
ing allowed.
Second, the organization of Game
Protective Associations throughout ihe
Southwest to crystalize and make ef
fective public sentiment in fa vor of
game protection. These Associations
aresteadilv gruwing ;a New Mexico,
active organizations exist at Taos. Al
buquerque, Santa Fe, Magdalena and
Silver City.
Third, a vigorous campaign, carried
on jointly by the State Game Wardens,
the Game Protective Association, and
the Forest Service, for the absolute en
forcement of the game laws.
Fourth, a vigorous campaign of pub
lic education carried on by the same
three agencies, which will teach people
the value of game, the necessity for
game conservation, and the fact that
under present conditions, the breaking
of the game law, instead of being a
sporting Chance reprehensible only
when detected, is AN ACT UN
WORTHY OF A CITIZEN.
The National Forests of Arizona and
New Mexico, it is said, instead of yield
ing thousand; of deer and turkey each
year, ought to yield tens of thousands,
but they will never do o until an ade-
Lquate breeding stock has been restored
by vigorous action along the lines in.
dicated.
