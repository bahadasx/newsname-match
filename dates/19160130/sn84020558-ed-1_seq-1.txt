ing here late tonignt continued to
place the death roll from the flood
at Otay valley at at least fifty but
cut down estimates of the dead in
San Luis Rey Valley to ten. It had
been telieved that perhaps fifty
persons were drowned there.
Rescue work in the Otay vslley
was reported to be proceeding very
slowly. Nineteen bodies had been
found at the town of Otay. Several
other bodies were sighted in the
flood waters but could not be
reached. Six of the bodies recov
ered were found on the beach
where they hd been swept up after
passing out into the bay. Of these
threo were of aged persons.
The town of Ti Juana, Mexico,
h been almost submerged. The
Ti Juana hot springs hotel collapsed
Thursday night, according to re
ports brought here by flood refu
gees They said cries were heard
ot persons from the hotel who were
swept down the Ti Juana river.
The Sweetwater dam, part of the
San Diego water system, of which the
Otay dam that was washed out was the
final barrier to the waters of the Otay
river, is in imminent danger of being
carried away, according to reports. A
large force of workmen are fighting
desperately to save this structure,
which, if it breaks,, will add enormous
ly to the present devastation. '""
The Tla Juana race track, which has
been washed away by a flood, was
opened last New Year's day and a 100
day meeting was planned. The truck
was the property of the Lower Califor
nia Jockey club.
The track was built under a special
concession from Governor Cantu of
Lower California. One f the features
cited in favor of the location was that
the horsemen could be assured of a
dry fast course the year round.
The mayor of Sun Luis Rey is head
ing the work of relief in the San Luis
Rey valley, which lies north of San
Diego. A continuous rain is hampering
the work and adding to the flood. To
make matters worse, the local weather
bureau tonight said another big storm
was sweeping down from the north.
The property damage in San Diego
county continues to be estimated at
one million dollars. The San Diego
and Arizona railroad bed has been
swept out for thousands of feet. San
Diego bay is covered with wreckage of
all kinds and it is believed that many
bodies will be found in the water.
San Diego Isolated
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29. Los Ange
les county line marked the limit to
night for adventurous persons seeking
to reach San Diego, a hundred and
twenty-six miles south. All roads fur
ther down were impassable.
Telegraph and telephone lines were
down. The various offices were lie
sieged all day by men and women beg
ging for news, and offering almost
anything they had for the privilege of
sending a message.
A steady rain here tonight gave
promise of conditions still worse.
First news of the flood disaster in
Otay valley was brought to San Diego
late Friday by Col. Max Fleischman, of
Cincinnati, millionaire distiller, who
flew over the devastated region in an
aeroplane. This information was
brought he,re today by D. C. .laekling,
mining magnate, who arrived from the
southern city on his yacht Cypress.
When portions of houses and other
debris began floating into San Diego
bay, Mr. Fleischmann, accompanied by
an aviation instructor, made a trip in
land to investigate the reports that a
disaster had occurred, Mr. Jackling
stated.

tie valleys for fifty miles north of
the Mexican line lie desolate tonight,
from floods and cloudbursts.
With the death toll in the otay val
ley seemingly established at fifty
souls and all relief agencies working
in that direction, reports reached here
late today of floods sweeping the
San Luis Rey and San Pasfpial val
leys, doubling the loss of life. With
communication almost cut off it was
imiiossilile to list accurately the num
ber of the dead; conjecture 'and
meagre reports alone were available.
Seventeen bodies were taken out of
San Diego bay before nightfall. These
had been swept down when the lower
Otay reservoir went out late Thurs
day and the current of the flood was
thought to have carried many others
out to sea.
The town of San Diego remained
virtually undamaged and supplemen
tary courses are available to replace
its regular water supply, cut off by
the breaking of the dam.
Many injuries were reported from Ti
Juana Hot Springs where a hotel
collapsed.
A cloudburst, reports had it, caused
the flooding of the San Luis Rey and
San Pasqual valley. The town of
San Pasqual. an ancient, tiny village,
cuddled in the mountains in a val
ley, was said to have been wiped out
altogether. 1

COLORADO RIVER TODAY
IMPROVING
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
DENVER, Colo., Jan. 29. Storm
conditions in the Rocky Mountain
states, which for two days were swept
by rain and snow from the Mexican
to the Canadian border, showed
marked improvement today. Accord
ing to advices received here, there
had been no loss of life.
The most serious property damage
was indicated in the vicinity of Plioe
nix and Yuma. Ariz, where the Gila,
Salt idid Colorado rivers were at
flood stages. Phoenix estimates placed
the damage in that region at $500,000.
Railroad and wire communication,
which was seriously interrupted,
showed gradual improvement tonight
Overland trains from the west were
reported 12 hours late owing to the
flood conditions in Southern Califor
nia and Arizona and heavy snows in
the Rocky Mountain, states. Cheyenne
advices stated that no trains from the
west had reached there today, and
that snow was drifting badly in south
western Wyoming.
Southwestern Colorado still was
blockaded although progress was re
ported in clearing Cumbres Pass of 28
foot drifts. Slides continued in the
Telluride and Silverton region, but
early tonight no loss of life was re-
ported
Overland traffic on the Den-
ver and Rio Grande, which crosses the
continental divide near Leadville was
considerably delayed.
Reports from Yuma. Arizona, were
that the Colorado river had passed
the 2 r. foot stage and was rising about
one foot an hour, with the crest of
the high waters two days away. Mer
chants were moving their stocks to
higher grounds and ranchers were
driving livestock from lowlands hith
erto considered immune from floods.
Reclamation officials said they
hoped to hold the Yuma valley levees.
Just rebuilt, but expressed doubt as
to whether those of the California
side would withstand the rise. Every
available man was being pressed into
service for strengthening the levees.
No word had. been received from the
Imperial valley since early morning
when the last wire to Yuma went
down.
Phoenix advices describe the storm,
which ended today, the worst in
eleven- years, hut it was expected
several days would elapse before flood
waters subside. The Arizona capital
was cut off from rail communication
by the washing out of bridges on the
Southern Pacific and Atchison To
peka and Santa Fe railroads. Twelve
feet of water was rushing over the
spillways of the Roosevelt dam and
the Gila and Salt rivers were at flood
stage, but receding.
Telegraph and telephone communi
cation, seriously impaired by storms,
east of the Missouri river showed im
provement. Tourists Are Marooned
GRAND JFNCTION, Colo., Jan. 29
Train service on the Uintah rail
way connecting Mack. Colo, and the

rooned passengers cannot get through.
Reports from Silverton mining men
say that the slides have resulted in a
sensational mining discovery. Accord
ing to District Judge W. N. Searcy,
Silverton miners, prospecting along
Cement Creek, saw a boulder, ten feet
in diameter, which had been carried
down by a slide and had split on strik
ing the bottom of the gulch, exposing
a six-foot black streak. The streak,
says the report, proved to be tungsten
assaying 85 per cent, with a marltet
value of $8,000 a ton at present prices.
Mining men say this discovery would
mean a body of the richest tungsten
ever found.
A tungsten fever that is said to
overweigh the fear of avalanches is re
ported at Silverton. Miners driven to
Silverton by mines closed on account
of the snow have joined the rush.
Other miners are reported to have left
the La Plata district on snow shoes,
defying slides in the forty mile trip to
Cement Creek.
Occasional new damage to mining
properties is reported from slides, but
so 'far no deaths have been reported.'
A Hllde in La Plata canyon has cov
ered a cabin near the mountain top in
which Eli blunt, an aged miner, is held
a prisoner. So many slides are runnin
I that it has been impossible to attempt
a rescue.

RYNDAM VICTIM
OF AN EXPLOSION
republican A. P. Leased Wire
NEW YORK, Jan. 29. An external
explosion, probably caused by an ex
ploding mine, disabled the Holland
America liner Ryndam off the English
coast somewhere between Ileal and
Falmouth on her way from New York
to Rotterdam, according to officers of
the Rotterdam, a sister ship, which ar
rived here tonight.
The Noordam was at Falmouth at
the time the Ryndam met with her ac
cident, and the officers of the former
vessel, said they were informed that a
mine undoubtedly caused the explo
sion. Three members of the Ryndam
engine room force were killed and sev
eral injured but none of the passengers
hurt. The Ryndam was able to make
her way to Gravesend.
Sixty-seven members of the Ford
peace expedition came home on the
Rotterdam. Most of them had pre
pared statements of their views on the
explosion and these statements were
distributed among the newspapermen
who boarded the steamer at ciuaran
tine. "Autocracy leadership," was blamed
by most of the voyagers for the lack
of success that attended their enter
prise. QUARTET OF BANK
ROBBERS-INDICTED
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
CHICAGO, Jan. 29. Four men ac
cused of robbing the Washington Park
National bank of $15,000, were indicted
today on six counts after Eddie Mack,
confessed leader of the quintet of rob
bers, had told the grand jury the story
of the robbery. Mack himself was not
indicted. The state's attorney said he
would not be prosecuted "if he kept his
promise to leave the country after tes
tifying in the trials of the indicted
men."
Mack, the slate's attorney said, had
made allegations that fifteen Chicago
policemen had protected criminals, and
that criminals had been - imported to
Chicago from New York to disecredit
the police department heads. These
allegations, said the slate's attorney,
were being investigated.
The four indicted men were all said
to have come from New York. They
are Alelander llrodie. Harry Kramer,
Charles Kramer and Harry Fein.
PROTESTS AGAINST
SEIZURE OF MAIL

NEW YiiRK. Jan. 29. An informal
protest against the seizure of mail

ship Rotterdam, by P.ritish authorities,
in the Downs was filed with the board
ing officers by Dr. Henry Van Dyke,
United States minister to The Nether
lands, who was a passenger aboard the
steamer, he announced upon the ar

Heretofore the British have been
seizing only mail from Germany and
Austria, and a portion of that from
neutral countries but all that on board
the Rotterdam was taken, including
104 bags from Holland and 22 from
Switzerland. There were in all 70S
bag--. All mail, including that from
neutral countries, was removed also
from the Holland-American liner

The western front has been the
scene of really heavy fighting, the
Germans having launched a determ
ined offensive there.
After making, in recent days, sev
eral dents in the entente allies lines,
which had been straightened out again
in whole or in part by counter at
tacks, the Teutons yesterday, after
heavy bombardments, assaulted the
allied positions along a front of sev
erai Kilometers soutn ot tne river
Somme and to the northeast of Neu
ville in the Artois region.
The attacks resulted, according to
Berlin, in sweeping gains in both
cases the village of Frise and 1,000
yards of trenches south of it being
taken m the more southerly sector,
while in the Neuville region, 1,500
yards of trenches were stormed, the
gains amounting to nearly a mile and
a half of front. Incidentally more than
1,100 prisoners and twenty-two ma.

failed in their attacks on the bank
of the Somme, where they were able
to drive a detachment of French out
of the village of Frise. Paris asserts
that the attack has been checked and
that some of the trenches lost were
recovered.
Elsewhere than on the Franco

as the official reports show, except
that in the 'Caucasus the Russians

ZEPPELINS VISIT PARIS
PARIS. Jan. 21. Paris has just
been completely darkened in antici
pation of a Zeppelin raid. Fire en
gines and gonads of trumpeters are
going through the city sounding the
alarm.
Searchlights also are in operation
and the noise of aeroplanes is heard
ir several directions, but as , yet the
sound of only two shots has been
beard. It is uncertain whether the
shots came from approaching Zep
pelins or were those of anti aircraft
guns.
- A Zeppelin was heard over Paris
at :i:20 o'clock .and shortly after
two bombs were dropped, injuring ten
persons.
It has been learned that about a
dozen bombs were dropped in all,
killing Id persons and wounding "0.
The prescribed trumpet signal an
nouncing that danger from Zeppelins
is past has been given and .the city
is again lighted as usual.
A man. three women and two
children were killed, by one of the
bombs dropped by the raiders when
a house was destroyed. The other oc
cupants were wounded. At other
points there was only material
damage.
At midnight 1 'resident Poincare, ac
companied by the military governor
of Paris and the prefect of police,
visited the locality where several
bombs fell. Investigation i-evealed ad
ditional casualties. All inspection of
one ruined house disclosed that two
persons had been killed in their beds.
In a drug store which had been re
duced to a pile of ruins the bodies
of a woman and a. child were found.
At another point the force of the
explosion was so great that trees
were uprooted and flung on the roofs
of distant houses.

i ifficials and employees .of the Ari
zona Eastern railroad spent an anx-
omewhat strenuous dav yes
terday at Tempe, using every facility
at their command to prevent any
great damage to the railroad bridge
at that place.. Owing to the solid
construction of the bridge, there was
mt little danger of material damage
from the flooded river but a strong
fight had to be kept up all during
the day to prevent the river from
carrying away a portion of the ap
pioaches on the north side of the
bridge. Superintendent Scott stated
yesterday evening that apparently the
efforts of the men had been success
ful, and no harm, will result.
A large number of hags of sand
and large rocks were hauled to the
bridge from this city, and the earthen
approaches were fortified with these.
The bridge proper, is said to be one
of the strongest of its kind in the
state and will withstand the assault
of floods for years to come.
Mr. Scott was most emphatic in his
denial of the report published in an
afternoon paper to the effect that the
bridge at Queen Creek had been
washed out, and stated that no harm
had come to the structure. The train
from Florence came over the bridge
yesterday evening in good shape,
The work of driving piling for the
new temporary tressle at the Sacaton
crossing of the Gila river, was not
materially interrupted during the day
by the rise in the water, and t lie two

Although Phoenix is still flood
hound, and the water in the Salt riv
er is still high, conditions have im
proved greatly within the past twenty-four
hours. The crest of the flood
in the Salt river passed here yester
day morning. At Florence where,
an accurate tab was kept on the wa
ter, the crest passed some time dur
ing the night. The water at no time,
anywhere in the Salt, was as high as
in the flood of last week. It lacked
about is inches at Florence, of reach
ing the mark made by the crest there
last week. At Tempe, the guage
showed 17 feet of water in the chan
nel. The Gila has not yet reached its
highest mark, and it is expected that
if. will rise quite a bit yet. Officials
in touch with the situation expressed
the opinion that the river could come
up to some extent, but that it would
in all probability not reach the high
water mark of last week.
New Mark at Dam
At six o'clock yesterday morning
there was 11.52 feet of water pouring
over the spillways at the Roosevelt
Dam. This was .52 of an inch more
water than went over last week, mak
ing it a high mark in the history of
the dam.
The water started to fall at that
point, and at 1:15 yesterday after
noon it was eleven feet. At 2:15 it
was still going down, and registered
10.011. The reading at five o'clock,
was 10.40, showing that the water was
coming in a little faster than it could
get out. The raise was unexpected.
.. . Salt Goes Down
The Salt river started to go down
yesterday morning at seven o'clock.
At that time, it registered 10 feet 10
inches. Between that time and two
o'clock in the afternoon, there was a
drop of three inches. At ten o'clock
iast night the water had continued
to drop, and registered ten feet. Con
ditions at the bridge were easy last
night. About all those on watch could
do, was keep a sharp lookout for de
bris, and as soon as they lodged
pgainst the bridge, fish them out.
Riverside Park was flooded again
all day yesterday. The water did not
come up as high as it did last week,
when the park was damaged beyond
repair.
The other half of Phoenix', which
failed to get a look at the high water
last week was on hand at the bridge
yesterday. There was a constant

day. A deputy sheriff was on hand,

being cut away. Four or five hundred
yards below the bridge the bank be
tween the canal and river has entirely
disappeared and much of the canal
water is returning to the river.
On the ranches along the river bot
tom above and below Tempe some
of the oVners have been required to
move off and some parts of the land
are covered by the overflow water
Irom the stream but no damage is
feared.
Tempe has again been visited by
many hundred out of town people to
day bent on seeing the flood. Travel
to' and fro has been unusually heavy
and there has been a constant stream
of autos, buggies and pedestrians on
the state highway 'bridge where the
best vantage point is to be had.
