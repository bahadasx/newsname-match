WILSON APPEALS
FOR PATRIOTISM
OF REVOLUTION
President Declares Test of National
, Preparedness Lies Not with
Congress, but with Men
of Land.
K3SD SPIRIT OF OTHER DAYS
Executive Says He Believes There
Are Many Selfish Influ
ences at Work.
IS NOT AFRAID OF DEBATE
PITTSBURGH, Pa.. Jan. 29.
President Wilson, opening her to
day his six-day program of speaking
In the middle west on national pre
paredness, told a throng which
paced kemorlal haMU that the test
of national preparedness lies not
with congress but with the men of
the country and their rail to volun
teer, ' and their employers, who
should oppose no obstacle to free re
sponse, i
"And for one," the presiJent said, "I be
lieve both the young men and the em
ployers will do their duty.
."And I am not afraid that America will
not do enough. I am only desirous that
It should be very coolly considerate of
what It does. One cool Judgment Is worth
a thousand hasty counsels."
The president declared against the tak
ing of advice of professional sailors and
eoldiers on some questions.
"It Is time that we attempted, at any
rate, to apply the standard of our own
life to national defense. What do we
want to defend? Need I answer. We want
to defend the equal honor of a nation
against all other nations and we wish
s
to maintain the peace of the western
emlsptiere.
.rrat Ideals to Defend.
"Whore are our great needs of defense?
"Did ,ou ever stop to reflect Just what
it Is thdt America stands for? It stands
for the sovereignty of the self govern
ing people of the world. Our assistance,
our encouragement has thrilled two con
tinents in this western hemisphere. This
Is what we stand for.
"It seems to mo that America Is In love
with efficiency. Material efficiency of
which we hear so. much. only, underlies,
however, what I. may .call, spiritual ef
ficiency. "I, for my part, have. a. great enthus
iasm for rendering America, spiritually
efficient. The plana for our mllltlary ef
ficiency do not provide for a great army.
We want only an army necessary for the
use of peace,' but we want back of that
army a trained body of men. These man
should be civilians', men who know that
the arts of peace corns' before the arts of
"Men should 'drea.1 War and Vnow that
everything on which the nation depends
comes from peace.
Details Not latwertaat.
"The details of the army plans do not
may any difference. Perhaps they have
better plans. But I do want sua adequate,
and efficient force of at least 600,000 men
trained to the arts of war who will be
ready to protect the nation.
"This nation will not be stalked by
ghosts and fancies.
"T am proposing something more than
1 mporary. It is my conception that aa
i.- government has encouraged a gen-
ral training, it should also encourage ln-
dUHtrlnl training and It is Derfectly feasl-
1e along with industrial training: to In
struct our young men in the handling of
rifles and guns and the rudimentary arts
of warfare ir, strict them and at . the
same time quicken and ennoble the per
formance of the tasks of peace.
"But wo don't take the time now to de
velop and encourage these school. We
must train and equip a very considerable
body of men.
"The test of preparedness does not lie
in congress. It Is going to be in the re
sponse of the young men of the country
to the call to volunteer and of the em
ployers of those men to place no obstacle
1o their answering the call. I, for one,
believe there are many selfish Influences
at work In this countiy. When It comes,
however, to the test, I believe America
t an produce ai much substantial patriot
ism aa any other land under the sun."
The president's words were marked fre
quently by applause. He spoke rapidly,
but clearly, , -
"I am not afraid of debate. I am not
afraid that out of it we will not get re
suits. I am talking myself and certainly
the other fellow should have his chance,
"I am sorry this is a campaign year.
( hope this question will not be a partisan
question. No man should attempt to
make political capital of It I will be
shamed of any friends of mine who take
different view.
"Republicans and democrats rr.sy have
many differences, but there is no reason

The last of the state anti-trust suits
against seven Texas breweries was set
tled In district court here late Friday,

charters, accept an injunction restrain
ing them from future violations of the
anti-trust and political contribution law
and bound themselves to pay the court
costs and a pcrcenlngo of the costs of the
attorney general's investigations.
The Dallas brewery had filed motion
for a Jury trial, but this waa withdrawn
and the agreed Judgment approved,

laws and the act of 1907 fixing specific
penalties for political contributions by
corporations, "are resolved" against the

lations of the act of 1871 forbidding cor
porations from using their assets for
purposes other than those for which they
are chartered, its charter is forfeited and
it is enjoined from future violation of the
statutes. The defendant admits it contri

Oceanside la a summer resort with twoi
good-alsed hotels and a population of
about 1,000. The Ban Luis Rey valley con
tains one of the great. Miller A. Lux
cattle ranches which dot the state for
TOO miles and are known to cattlemen
throughout the world.
Railroads, highways, telephone, tele
graph, the ordinary means of communi
cation and relief, were gone with no pros
pect of early recovery. Only the sea re
mained and from it aid began to come,
t'aa't Penetrate Valley.
An expedition from the Unllod States
warships In Pan Dlcgo bay waa started In
launches and barges for the Otay valley.
Reports were that the first landing party
had been unable to penetrate the valley
for reasons not given. The destroyer
Lawrence moved down from Its station
here and anchored off the mouth of the
Otay river, which stream ran bank full
after being dry for years.
An overland expedition also was started
from' Ban Diego, with pontoons and en
gineering equipment by which It was
hoped swollen streams might be crossed
and mired roads made passable. No word
came back aa to Its succcm.
No one here knew tonight what was go

It waa impossible even to estimate the
amount of Immediate relief work to be
done because no word from the stricken
valleys conveyed any Idea of the number
or plight of the survivors.

First reports of the Otay disaster

and stock drowned. Investigation ap
peared to indicate exceptionally high
water, and word came that the lower
Otay dam waa holding. This dam started.
