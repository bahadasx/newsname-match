Urge Men of Columbus am!
Vicinity to Vote for Bond Is
ue Next Tuesday.
If the efforts of the la-lies and
children of Columbus count for
anything the election on the propo
sition to issue bonds in the sum of
$50,000 for the erection and equip
ment of a new high school building,
which is to occur next Tuesday, will
be carried by a large majority.
The fight for the building origin
ated with the ladies of the Civic
League, who have been working for
some time to secure the bond issue
and these ladies have been joined by
students of the public schools, who
have entered the campaign with en
thusiasm which is characteristic of
wouth and are urging the citizens to
vote for the bond issue not only by
verbal appeals but through written
communications. These children are
sending out letters to the voters of
Columbus and its environs, and that
they have some strong arguments
in favor of the undertaking to
bring to bear, and also know how
to present their cause in a forceful
manner is evinced by the follow
ing excerpt from a letter received
by a Columbian:
"A new high school will be a ben
efit to Columbus. It .would bring
families here to educate their chil
dren, and we would not be ashnmed
i
to point it out to strangers, to whom
we hesitate to show the building?
now in use." j
Surely, if the children of Colum
bus realize the need of a high school
building so fully that they are will
ing to forego the pleasures and pas
times of youth in order that they
may make personal appeals to the
citizens to vote for the bond issue
these citizens should evince suffi
cient interest in their welfare to
yield to their pleadings.
On yesterday both the teachers
and pupils of the public schools car
ried on an active campaign in behalf
of the bond issue. They called on
citizens both in the business district
and the suburbs, requesting to be al
lowed to pin on their coats tag?
bearing the slogan: "I will vote for
the high school bonds, wont you?"
These request"? met with general
asquiescence, and the trend of pub
lic sentiment seems to indicate that
the bond issue will be carried by a
handsome majority.
The voting of bonds for the erec
tion of a new high school building
does not mean that we are spending
money on a luxury. It is not a lux
ury, but an actual need, and a most
urgent one; for, under present con
ditions, it is impossible to give the
boys and girls of Columbus and the
contiguous country, the physical and
mental training which is necessary
to develop them into strong, well
educated, self-reliant men and wom
en, who will go out into the world
fitted in every way to meet and su
cessfully overcome the many prob
lems and perplexities of twentieth
century life.
Which is most precious to you, the
few cents you will save by voting
against the bond issue or the mental
and bodily welfare of your children?
Put this question to yourself when I
you go to the polls next Tuesday,
and if, after weighing the matter,
you do not decide to vote for a bond
issue, the Commercial is disappoint
ed in the high estimate which it has
placed upon the citizenship of Co
lumbus. Longino Visits City.
Ex-Governor A. H. Longino, of
Jackson, was a distinguished visitor
to Columbus Thursday. There was
nothing of a political nature attach
ed to the visit of the former govern
or, he having merely come here to
fee his daugter, Miss Annie Ramsey
longino, who is a student at the In
dustrial Institute and College.

WILL BEGIN BUYING BUT
TER FAT FROM FARM
ERS SOON.
SKCUKKCOLLKGK
STRKKT STAND
Creamery Will be Established
As Soon as Local Conditions
Warrant It.
Mr. A. H. Taylor, of Okolona
who for some time past has been in
terested in a scheme to establish a
creamery in Columbus, was in the
city Friday, and arrangements which
will ultimately result in the launch
ing of an enterprise of this charac
ter here were completed during his
visit.
The company which , is backing
Mr. Taylor has secured a lease on
the building on College street for
merly occupied by the Premium Ice
Cream Company, and on February
7th will begin buying butter fat
therein. At the outset this butter
fat will be shipped to Okolona
where it will be transferred into
butter, but as soon as the output
from 500 cows can be secured the
necessary machinery will be pur
chased and a creamery established
here. The output of 500 cows will
amount to about 350 pounds of but
ter fat per day, which is the small
est supply which could be profitably
used in the operation of a creamery.
In addition to buying butter fat
the company will manufacture a
high wade of ice cream. The manu
facture of this commodity will be
gin about March 1, and both the
wholesale and retail trade will be
supplied.
Mr. Taylor is very much encour
aged with the outlook here, and in
conversation with a Commercial
lepoiter stated that he did Hot think
It would be long before the local
:. imply of butter fat would be suf
ficiently large to justify the com
pany in beginning the operation of
a creamery here. It behooves local
farmers to liberally patronize the
new enterprise, for the quicker the
requisite amount of butter fat if
secured the sooner will be the es
tablishment of the creamery.
As evidence of the fact that the
creamery project is to receive liber
al support there was a meeting of
Lowndes county dairymen at the
Chamber of Commerce yesterday
inoiriini' which was well attended and
at which unbounded enthusiasm pre
vailed. The principal feature of the
meeting was an address by Mr. C. W.
Rugg, of Thrasher, Miss., who spoke
on "The Creamery from a Patron's
Standpoint." Mr. Taylor, who is at
the head of the creamery movement
also made a short talk, in which he
outlined sucinctly the policy which
he intends to pursue in the manage
ment of the plant.

she studied in the rsewcomb Art
School for a part of two seasons, as
well as in the Art Academy, of Cin

New York, and abroad. She has been
teaching applied art in the Indus
trial Institute and College at Co
lumbus, Mississippi, for a number of
years.
"During all that time, the exhib

When, in 1912, the Mississippi Art

Jackson during the fair, she was
awarded the first prize, exhibiting
there many of the pictures shown
here during the past month.
"Besides her landscapes and de

known as a portrait painter of un
usual ability. Her most conspicuous
success is her portrait, exhibited for
the first time in Jackson last fall, of
the late C. II. Alexander, the well
known Mississippi statesman, who
was a candidate for governor in

After numerous ron-ultation.
confabs and conference.!, the com
missioners of the everd different

county have at !a.-t united upon a
plan for improving the public roids
and have agreed to a--k the boar I of

taking and carrying on this work.
The plan agreed upon contemplate
that the fir.t district shall furnish

and the fourth district $10,000.
While the eeond district will par
ticipate in the expenditure, how
ever, none of the money will be
disbursed within its confines, the
entire amount being used to im
prove public roads in the first and
fourth and fifth districts.
The second district has recently
expended $."0,000 in bettering its
roads, and the additional outlay of
$l'J3,ooo will make a total disburse
ment of $17:1,000 on public high
ways in Lowndes county during the
short space of a year.
The proposed expenditure will
not only complete the route of the
Jackson Highway through Lowndes
county, but will complete the coun
ty's good roads system, and in agree
ing to share the expense of con
struction in outlying territory the
members of the local district dis
played commendable wisdom, for
Columbus is included in their juris
diction, and whatever helps the
county at large will naturally bring
beneficial results to the capital and

will receive $J0,000, the fourth dis

which is five miles southwest of Co
