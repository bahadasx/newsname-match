Cardinal Gibbons occupied the
throne inside the sanctuary during the
celebration of high mass at Holy
Trinity Church today, and at the oon
cluslon of the ceremony administered
confirmation to nearly 250 men,

the church.
Following the, confirmation exer

providing- for'prohlbltlon" In the District
upon the Corby Company's yeast fac
tory at Langdon, a 2.000,000 industry,
will be looked into at once by Andrew
Wilson, president of 'the Anti-Saloon
League of the District, and Albert E.
Shoemaker, , the league's attorney.
They will consider, after conference
with prohibition leaders, the advisabil
ity of backing an amendment permit

Recognized in Bill..
This announcement was made this af
ternoon following teh announcement
by The Times that the Sheppard bill
would result In closing up the Corby
plant, which sells alcohol, produced as
a by-product, under the restriction that
It be not used for beverage purposes.
Entire ignorance of the fact that grain
alcohol was manufactured as a by
product of yeast making at the Langdon
factory was professed both by Mr. Wil
son and bv Mr. Shoemaker. They said
the need for alcohol for mechanical, sci
entific, and. In wines, for sacramental
purposes, waa recognized In tho bill,
which permit its importation for thdse
purposes. But they admitted entire ig
norance that tho Corby company sold
alcohol, as well as fusel oil, vinegar,

we Should look Into the advisability of.

intent of the bill, as indicated by its
making exceptions Jn the case of wood
alcohol and denatured alcohol, and In
the Importation of alcohol" for mechani
cal and scientific purposes, and wine
for sacramental use, was simply to pro
hibit the use of alcohol for beverages.
No Medicinal Value.
"How widespread Is tho manufacture
of grain alcohol here. I do not know.
We did know that there are no distil
leries here, and I had no Idea that
grain alcohol was manufactured by the
Corby company, or by anyone else."
Mr. Wilson said he had not known of
the production of alcohol by the Corby
company. So far aa the sale of alcohol
for medicinal purposes Is concerned, Mr.
Wilson said, the league Is opposed to
any exceptions on that ground.
"It has been shown conoluselvly," Mr.
Wilson said, "by a long series of ex
periments by. a noted expert, that al
cohol can have -no medicinal value. To
permit Its manufacture or Its importa
tion on that pretext would be to nullify
any prohibition measure."
Convinced of Opposition to Con
tinental Army, He Is Ready
to Alter Program.
President Wilson 1ms decided Tiot to
Insist that onpress shall adopt the 'con
tinental army" feature of the Admin
istration's national defense- program.
Convinced from rccnt talks whih he
has had with Democratic leaders of the
House, and Senate that there Is at pres
ent an overwhelming" opposition to this
plan, he has decided, some of his ad
visers declaio, to concentrate on the
need of tho country for E00.0OO trained
men, leaving It to Congress to Jeoldo
on the orcnnltutlon of this force.
It will be for Congiess to decide
whether tho number U to be mido up
by an lncreus of the regular armv or
of the nations! gtiard, or both, or by
a reserve system.
Plain hint of the President's position,
his advisers say. was given In his
soeech In Pittsburgh yesterday, when ho
said:
"The details of the armv olan do not
make any difference. Perhaps others
have better plans: but I do want an
adequate and efficient force of at least
fiOO.000 men trained to the arts of war.
who will be ready to protect the na
tion." In thus leaving the question of rais
ing these men to Congress, the Presi
dent has paved the wav for a lively
free-for all. three-cornered tight between
the members of Congress who would In
crease the striding array to 500.000 men.
those who would make no Increase In
the regular army but raise the national
guard to this strength, and those -who
would have no Increase at all.

and returned to the Municipal Build
ing with suggestions as to certain
amendments to some of the bills, al
though It was uald that no funda
mental changes were terorr.monded
by the. loglsla torn.
Itlijsald to bo likely that one of
the first bills approved by the sub
committee will be that providing
that the Commissioners shall name
the recorder of deeds and the regis

lumbia. The subcommittee also
evinced favorable interest In the pro
posal to give the Commissioners au
thority to name the board of chil
dren's guardians, board of charities,
and the trustees pt the Industrial
Home Schodl.
The Commissioners urged early ac

The plan of the Commissioners, as
outlined to Chairman Vinson and his
colleagues on tho Judiciary subcom

the tentative approval of the louse
members.
The. Subcommittee expects to hold
hearings on the measure proposing to

the purchase of another site.
A measure authorizing the commit

proposed in tho District estimates.
Other Minor Bills.
Other bills of a more minor character,
covering recommendations made In the
annual estimates of the Commissioners,
were also considered by the Vinson
subcommltce. and the cltv heads seemed
Confident after the conference that a
favorable report will be recommended
on most of the desired legislation.
If the Houso District Committee sets
promptly on the administrative reforms
proposed the Page subcommittee of the
House Appropriations Committee Is
resdv to Include some of the desired
legislation as riders upon the District
appropriation bill. Such action would
expedite consideration of District af

FRED A. K0LSTER INVENTOR
Young Man Employed at Bureau
of Standards Contributes
' Scientific Marvel.
"Davy Jones's" death knell has
sounded.
No longer will this deep-sea
"Locker," famed among sailormen
of the long voyage, reap its full
human harvest from storm and
fog at sea; for a young Washing
tonian has perfected a device
which experts agree will, to a great
extent, reduce loss of life, and
make possible, in a large measure,
the safe navigation of all the
Seven Seas, in spite of Fog and
Storm those two grim henchmen
of Davy Jones.
And the device has been made
possible as many other safe
guards to human life have by
wireless.
When a calm-eyed boy sat in
the wireless house of the doomed
Republic on the- night of January
24, 1009, flinging out from crack
ling aerials his "C. Q. D" the
World and hjs Wife, astounded,
exclaimed: "At last the dangers
of the sea have been conquered!"
B1NNS WORKED MIRACLE.
Young Jack Blnns had worked the!
first life-saving miracle of the wireless.
In a heavy fog, tho White Star liner,
with 742 passengers aboard, had been
rammed by the Italian, Florida. Each,
too 'badly wounded to help the other,
rolled helpless upon the fog-draped
ocean, alone in many miles of black
sea waste.
A few years before Marconi had con
trolled the Hertzian waves, each of the
stricken steamers would have carried
Its human freight to tl;e bottom.
But tho "C. Q. D." which Blnns
snapped out Into the night of his dis
tress, brought every liner within a
radius of 150 milcB "full speed ahead"
to the wrecked steamers and 1,361 pas
sengers were saved.
A new and leaner era In the murder
ous annals of Davy Jones' Locker had
begun
Still those, who believed that this first
feoi of the wireless would sweep all
danger from the seas were wrong: for,

AFTER 10 UN
RAID ON PARIS
Women and Children Among the
' Victims of First Attack Made
on French Capital for a
Year.
Two Score Injured by Bombs
and Property Damage Is
Enormous Streets and
Houses Are Wrecked.
PARIS, Jan. 30. -Ten dead, in
cluding womeh and children, and
two score injured is the toll taken
by German air raiders. in the first
Zeppelin raid on this city in a year.
A dozen bombs were rained
upon the city by the aerial dread
naughts, which circled over the
heart of Paris for more man air
hour before being driven off.
, From the great destruction
caused by individual bombs it is
conjectured that the Germans used
a new high explosive much more
powerful than any before em
ployed. Six of the ten persons were kill
ed in rme house, threfejofthese being-
vomen and Wo.,cmjHi;ensi-,'The
house in which they slept was de
molished. BED BLOWN UP.
TWo other victims were killed while
they slept, a bomb blasting a great
hole In the roof of their home and blow
ing their bed to pieces. The other vic
tims were killed while In a drug store,
which was shattered.
As son as possible. President Polncare.
accompanied by the military governor
of Paris and the prefect of police. In
spected the damage done.
In addition to the deaths and Injuries,
great property damage waa done by the
raiders, and enormous holes were torn
in the streets. A dozen or more dwell
ings and stores were blown to atoms,
and many animals were killed either by
bombii or tho terrific concussion.
Many details of tho combat between
the French and enemy airmen are being
withheld b the censor.
The Zeppelins penetrated the outer
aerial defenses of the city and soared
to points directly over the principal
residential section. Several bombs were
dropped, as If the raiders were trying
to get the range, and then a hall of
explosives descended into the darkness
of the city, striking buildings and ex
ploding with deafening detonations.
Considerable time elapsed between the
dropping of the first series of bombs
and the deadly shower. This led to re
ports of two sepaYate raids, but tho pre
fect of police reported there was but one
raid, the aerial dreadnaughts having
remained over the city some time with
out dropping explosives.
At the first signal of the approach of
the hostile alrcrafts Paris' aerial de
fense squadrons, created a year ago
to meet just such attacks, sprang Into
action. In a few moments aeroplanes
mounting rifles and rapid-fire guns took
wings In all sections of the city flying
In the direction from which came the
sound of the Zeppelin motors.
Bedlam Throughout City.
Fire bells were rung, whistles blown,
and Are department apparatus gotten
Into readiness for use. The bells and
whistles drew crowds to the streets
which were plunged Into darkness when
first reports of the raiders' approach
were heard. Men. women, and children"
thronged the bridges across the Selnri
and peered Into tne sky to watch the
aerial battlo. Crippled soldiers, soldiers
on leave from the trenches, and reslr
dents from the rich and poor sections
of tha city mingled on tho streets,
laughing merrily as they watched for
sights of strife between heaven and
earth.
As quick as they were, however, the
French aerial defenders were unable to
reach the altitude held by the Zeppelins
until the dirigible balloons had gotten
well over the city. Within a few mo
ments, however, the defenders sighted
the enemy, and the grapple In midair
started. Many shots were exchanged d
the Zeppelins and aeroplanes, but tho
result of tho firing waa not learned, ex
cept that the defenders returned with
their machines unharmed, while the
Zeppelins were compelled to retire be
cause of the bombardment. Tho aoro
Slanlsts circled above and below the
lg gas tubes directing a steady Are at
them.
Paris accepted the raid with stoicism
and confidence, and there was a dis
position to regard it as "great sport"
until tho fatalities were reported.
