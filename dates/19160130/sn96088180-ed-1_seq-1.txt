8.HI Diego, Jan. 29 (vU Wireless

cavalrymen rode through the muddy
desolation that once at Guy valley's
famuiis "(rustless ibell" today, hunt
ing for bodies of 50 men, women and
children killed wh-o lower Otay dam
collapsed, a dreary party of refugees
started for San Diego, surrendering
all Idea of finding their loved one'
remains.
Since Thursday nlKht when the
dam aunt a 40-foot wall of water
thundering Into peaceful orange
grovea and rune In, a handful of
tlioHo who em-aped remained nearby,
hoping agaliiMt hope that friends or
relative might by aome miracle have
been saved. Hut when the aoldlera
rode their 'horaea Into the morass to
day and found nothing, the taut hope
died.
Returning from their search the
troopa reported the deluge had awept
everything clean. Not a trace re
mained of the grovea, the cottages,
the ranches, or the people. ,'
It was evident that the suddenly
loosed force struck with such force
that homes were smashed to drift
wood, trees scooped up, roots and all,
and human beings torn limb from
limb by the whirling flood.
The aurvlvora are those who heed
ed early warnings and fled to the
hills. Those who remained were kill
ed whore they sat at dinner or stood
jieorlng out at tho rain. The water
traveled at express train speed, and
everything living In Its path was
doomed.

STEAM SCMIi
Oakland, Cat., Jan. 29. Report
of a lifeboat filled with men and
buff otod by the wave of the ocean
off Point Monterey have been re
ceived by Captain Fred Underman,
owner of the Ill-fated steam achooner
Aberdeen. The nowa strengthen the
belief of the captain and hi brother
that the crew of the vessel may yet
bo safe and arrangements for a pa
trol to cruise In the vicinity are being
made.
Oakland, Cat., Jan. 29 That the
metal lifeboat carried by the Ill-fated
steam achooner Aberdeen has not
ben discovered and no part of It has
been cast upon the ieuch and that
In his opinion the eight members of
the Aberdeen's crew may be safe In
It or have been picked up by some
outbound vessel, was the statoment
of Ilert Underman, brother of Cap
tain Fred Underman, owner of the
boat. Bert Underman la the 8an
Francisco agent for the Signal line
of steamers, of which his brother Is
the principal owner.
"I hold fast to the theory that the
Aberdeen did not break up until after
she hit bottom In the breakers," he
told the United Press today. "EveryT
thing beara out the theory that the
men. realising that the wreck of the
vessel was inevitable, left her- in the
metal IIMioat on the open sea. If
they did this, they are probably far
out on the water today or have been
nicked up by some passing vessel.
The Aberdeen was equipped with a
high class motal lifeboat, equipped
with two air compartments. The boat
was ono or tho best or Its kind, and
was In addition to the wooden boats
which have been cast up In splinters
by the wavea."
Llnderman's theory Is borne out by
men of the llfo-savlng station. That
the Aberdeen, a etaunch vessel, went
t6 ploces In the open sea Is a theory
that Is being dlscnrdod from the fact
that parte of her that would have
sunk are upon tho beach. It Is also
believed thot the men reallxod their
danger long before the schooner got
Into the breaker, and knowing that
It would be Impoaslble for them to
effect a landing In the angry surf, put
directly out to sea.
The fact that no bodtea have been
found along the beach, though the
vessel and everything aboard has
been east up by the sea, also strength
ens Llnderman's theory.

"The struggle abroad haa now last
ed a year and a half; the end Is not
yet and all the time things are get
ting more and more difficult to
handle. If all could see the dls
patrhea I read every hour, they
would know how difficult It has been
to maintain peace.
"We are in the midst of a world
we can not alter, and therefore, as
your responsible servant, I must tell
you that the dangers are grave and
constant.
"We are even dependent now upon
the fcelllgorenta tor the movement of
our commerce. Where there I con
tact there Is likely to be friction, and
with nations engaged as many now
are In a life and death struggle, they
are likely to become stubbornly
steadfast in their proposals and con
victions." The president' words stirred more
than 6.000 persons crammed Into
Memorial hall. Nearly as many more
wero packed Into the second floor of
the building, hoping that the execu
tive would address them later. Yet
other were herded along the side

BROTHER IS HELD
US 1 FRANCE
Andrew GIgler has just received a
letter from his brother's wife In Ger
many bringing the news that hi
brother, believed lost In battle in
northern France, was still alive,
though held a prisoner of war in
France. The last Mr. GIgler had pre
viously heard his brother was report
ed among the missing, and had been
given up as lost. The brother was
fighting with his regiment of Ba
varians In northern France, and at
some time since the big offensive
campaign In September was severely
wounded. He was accompanied (by
two of his comrades when he fell,
and they assisted him as far as was
possible in leaving the field of battle.
They were obliged to desert him,
however, to make their own escape,
and that was the last heard of him
for several weeks, except that bis
wife received the official card telling
her that her husband was "missing."
It was not known by the comrades
how severely Mr. GIgler was wound
ed, but now a letter comes front him
In France. The letter was severely
censored before being allowed to
leave France, though the fact that
the prisoner of war states that he is
working indicates that he has recov
ered from his Injury. The censor
cut out that portion of the letter that
stated where and at what he was
working, but the relatives were
greatly relieved to know that be was
in the land of the living and still
able to work. The letter stated that
prisoner were kept on very short
ration and were 1bo much In need
of woolens to keep them warni. Show
ing the Increasing cost of provisions
in the belligerent countries, Mrs,
GIgler stated In her letter to Andrew
GIgler that she had mailed her hus
band some things, including a pound
of sausage that cost four marks a
pound. This represents about a dol
lar In American money. '
