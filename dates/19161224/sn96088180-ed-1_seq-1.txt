VIEW PEACE NOTE
Amsterdam, Dec. 33, The Cologne
Volks Zeltung views President Wll
son's peace note with suspicion, ac
cording to. despatohes received here
today.
"From our knowledge of President
Wilson," the newspaper comments,
"We ran easily picture the kind of
peace he wants. If he Is sincere, he
should make the entente assent to
the German proposals and state their
terms at a conference."
Other German newspapers expres
sed eagerness as to the outcome of
the president's proposals.
The Berlin Allgemelne Zeltung de
clared, "In view of the ontente's
statement and Its recent statement
that neutral Interference would be
considered nnrrlendly, we await
eagerly the ontente's attitude on the
Wilson note,"
"Anyhow," observes the . Vienna
None Krele Press, "The note will
cause the peace question to remain
for 4 considerable time In the tore
ground. The entente powers will toe
compelled to discuss reasonable peace
the desire tor which has thus been
strengthened In entente countries."

DEPARTf.lENT REFUSES RELIEF FOR
CALIFORNIA
i
Washington, Doc. 23. Effort of
the Joint public lands committee to
provide relief for the clalmpta-.of
the naval reserve lands In California
practically ended' today by the refusal
of the navy department to yield to
compromise proposals.
Secretary Daniels, in declining the
proposals, stated the navy depart-J
ment stood upon Its strict legal right
and was opposed to any legislation
for claimants of unpatented lands
wKhln the naval reserve.
At present the naval reserve Is
estimated at 239,000,000 barrets.
Over one billion barrels are aald to
fce held In reserve on shale land.
The proposed bill would affect only
5,000 acres ont of 30,000 acres In
reserve number two.
The proposal made by the Joint
committee with respect to legislation
for relief from the California claim
ants would eliminate from the effect
of the pending peaalng bill, all rail
road lands and other patented lands
In the naval oil reserve and all olalms
In which any charges of fraud had
been made.
It would also grant preferential
lease only to claimants of unpatent
ed lands and who had Initiated their
rlghta prior' to the first government
order of withdrawal In 1909.
The other proposal submitted by
Commissioner Tolman of the land
office would grant preferential leases
to claimant of nnpatenteted lands
applying for patents In the same re-

CASE CONTRADICTED 01 THE BRITISH
Washington, Deo, 23. Contradlft-
Ing Germany's contentions that the
steamer Arabia was a British trans
port, the British government today
Informed the state department that
the Arabia as not In admiralty ser-
when she was submarined and sunk
nor had she ever 'been In such ser
vice. England did say, however, the
Arabia carried some government pas-
Angers, "booked as ordlnanry packet ,
passenger at the expense of the gov-,
ernment."
There were no Asiatic soldiers
aboard, the note said. The state de
partment made the following an

prosecuted the development work.
The proposition of the Joint com
mittee, submitted today, follows:
That the terms bf the bill be mod-,
Wled, proving for a mora preferen
tial lease, without the naval
had Intimated their rights In this
claim prior to September 27, 1909,
either through themselves or through
their predecessor in Interest, where
there Is no charge of fraud In the
initiation or maintenance of snch

otherwise; provided that the depart
ment of the interior shall first find
that said claimant and their pre
decessors have acted In good faith
In developing such claims since the
Initiation to discovery of oil."
It was pointed out oy members of
the committee that the Phelan oil
land .leasing bill I really a part ot
the president's program for the con
servation ot mineral resources. ' ,
The stand taken 4y the navy de
partment today will hold up any ex
tension ot the president's conserva
tion program. The statement made
by navy department heads that the
alir would cripple the navy was de
nted. Records were produced showing
the oil needs ot the navy to be one
million barrels annually; an esti
mated Increase for the next ten
years, would place the need at 12.
000,000 barrels, with the necessity
of a reserve of about 25.000.000
barrel.

HIS SLEEVE
London, Dec. 23. The London

why President Wilson sent his peace

the belief that the American presi

was tmsed on special information

Continuous fighting has been go

With this army eliminated, the
bandit chief would hold undisputed
