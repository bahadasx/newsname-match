England Cancels Shipping Reports
NEWS indicntitiR that Germany's submarine campaign has become
o widespread and destructive that it is n more serious menace
to the Allies than nt any time in the war was received here
Inst night.
The British Government ifsued Friday nijrht an official order that
alt shipping reports except announcements of casualties are to be dis
continued at once. This order was transmitted last nipht to the Asso
ciated Press by its London oflice.
It wgg said last nijrht that New York agents had been notified
from London to cease advertising dates of steamship sailings.
The London "Daily News" says that because of the incrensed cub
marine menace the Ilritish Government war risk insurance office has
raised the insurance rate per voyage for British vessels to AO shillings
($10) per ctnt.
LONDON, Dec. 0. In the shipping paper "Fair Play" Sir Nor
man Hill, secretary of the Liverpool .Steamship Owners Association,
calculates that tht effect of the German campaign on Ilritish shipping
has been as follows:
In the tWenty-seven months of war from August, l!l I, to
October, 1010, 435 steam vessels of more than 1,000 tons, repre
senting; 1,744,000 tons gross register, were lost through war perils.
Great Britain started the war with .'1,000 steamships of 10,000,000
tons gross, so that the losses represent l'J per cent, in number.', or
11 per cent, in tonnage, being less than one-hulf of 1 per cent, a
month.
The value of the cargoes lost is calculated at 0.41 per cunt, of the
total by Sir Normnn, who adds: "A ten shillings in 100 pounds block
ade will never starve us."
