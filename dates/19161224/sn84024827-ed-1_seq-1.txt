U. S. Deserves Truth.
Similar issues apply to all the bel
ligerent countries in merely varying
form. What President Wilson wants
is their details. As the largest neutral
facing grave problems and as the
friend of all parties concerned, the
United States feels most earnestly
that it is entitled to know those facts.
Unless sVme one of the groups lays
down its actual terms there will be no
basis for negotiations and no possibil
ity of peace till the world is bled
white, officials declare.
Basis for Discussion.
There is not the slightest expecta
tion here that the terms laid down
will be reconcilable at first. It is
known that some 'of the nations will
demand what in actually they compose.
Nevertheless, the ne ruing of those
terms will afford a basis of negotia-
tions, a starting place from which the
conflicting interests can begin to con-
verge.

Nor is any embarrassment seen to
any of the nations in naming such
terms. It is understood in advance

New Policy for U. S.?
It is the administration's view that
the country can be committed to aban-
idonment of the policy of isolation as
much as President Monroe committed
it to the Monroe Doctrine without :
i. nio-
Senate action. In the plans so far con-
templated, however, it is probable the
nations would be guided by the treaty

interests involved. . It is expected it
may be some time before the Ameri
can viewpoint will be accepted abroad,
but it. is felt that in the end it cer
tainly will prevail!
It also is- stated most emphatically
that the note was not rushed off on
Monday in order- to get to Premier
Lloyd-George before he had irrevocably
committed the allies against peace in
his speech to parliament Tuesday
That assumption was foreseen, but of
ficials expect it to lose weight and im

off.
Resentment III Taken.
The early resentment in London and
Paris on the assumption that the Presi
dent's note declared both belligerents
were fighting tOr the same object is
regarded as unwarranted at the state
department where it was said today
great pains had been taken to avoid
that very Inference.
Stress was laid on the President's
words to show that he had not ex
pressed any conviction that both sets
of belligerents were fighting for the

Besides Eight Hour Day, Five
J Cents More an Hour Allow

Pro Rata Rates.
(By Ueiew Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Dec. 23. An eight
hour day, an increase in wages of
five cents an hour, and straight
pro rata over-time was granted
to the members of the switchmen's
union employed by 13 eastern and
middle western railroads 'n an
award filed here today by the
federal board cf arbitration that
heard their differences.
The decision of the board had
been eagerly awaited by the rail
roads in general, and the four
major brotherhoods of railroad
trainmen for what bearing it might
have on the controversy over the
Adamson act in which the eight
hour day is a question at issue.
5-Cent Increase.
The decision hmy that "pipht hnnra
or less snail constitute a day's work."
Glvp" ""n incrs" ' fiv an
hour on the present rates of pay", and
ru,pg that ov,,rt j au, ghall be paid ,t
pro rata rates." to be computed "on
the basis of the actual minutes
worked."
Switchmen at present receive a max
imum hourly rate Of 40 cents. The
award increases this rate to 45 cents
so that, as explained tonight by Judi;e
Charles B. Howry, chairman of the
board, on the eight hour basis they
will receive $3.60 for a day's work.
40 cents less than they received un
der the ten hour basis.
By working ten hours under the
new rate they will receive $4.50. or 50
cents more than under the old rate.
Will Hit Railroads.
In a statement appended to the
laiii. uj .luue njwry ana troiessor
! Jeremiah . Jenks. the neutral mem-
bers of the board of six. it is declared
that the Ions hours nf si-iti-hniMi Hr

that it has been established "it will
not be possible to make the actual
eight hour day effective in the case of
more than a small percentage of the
switching crews" and that "with the
exception of One experiment, the testi
mony was unanimous that the efficien
cy of the switchmen on the shorter day
would be only slightly increased so
that the shorter hours would fall al
most entirely upon the railroads."
