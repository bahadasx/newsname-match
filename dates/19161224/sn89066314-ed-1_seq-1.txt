CITY MANAGER PLAN
Legislature May Grant Per

C. R. JOURNEY HELPS
Instructor Advises Adoption
of New Rule Raps the
Mavor-Council Plan.
A state-wide campaign to awaken
interest in the city manager plan of
government for cities of the third
class, includes Columbia, has been
launched by the Missouri City Man
ager League which was organized De
cember 20 at Excelsior Springs. The
meeting was called there by Leslie
E. Bates, who was graduated by the
School of Law of the University in
1907, to draw up a bill to be presented
to the next State Legislature to per
mit cities of the third class to estab
lish the city manager plan. It. C.
Journey, instructor in political econ
omy at the Unhcrsity is secretary
treasurer of the league.
A bill asking for the permission was
drawn up in 1915 by a committee of
the League of Missouri Municipalities,
on which w ere Leslie Bates and Dean
Isidor Loeb. This Optional City Man
ager Bill was presented to the legis
lature. It was passed by the Senate,
but failed in the house. It was year
of wrangling in the legislature.
Asks Aid of Cities.
The league lost its enthusiasm. Mr.
Bates sent out letters to commercial
clubs and city officials asking them to
send representatives to a meeting to
be held at Excelsior Springs to take
action on. a city manager bill.
Twenty delegates were present. R.
C. Journey represented Columbia. The
Missouri City Manager League was
formed. J. F. Morris of Jefferson City
was elected president and L. E- Bates,
vice-president Mr. Journey was given
charge of the publicity. Dean Isidor
Loeb was appointed on the drafting
committee, of which Mr. Bates is
chairman.
All commercial clubs, civic organi
zations and city officials are being
solicited for their support in creating
public sentiment and contributing fi
nancial support needed to keep be
fore the legislature the importance of
the passage of the bill.
Defects of Present System,
The defects of the mayor-council
system of go ernnient, the inadequacy
of the commission form and the plan
of administration of municipalities
were explained jesterday in an Inter
view with Mr. Journey.
"There arc three t pes of municipal
government," he began. "The oldest
and most inefficient type Is the mayor
council system. It Is based, on the
old doctrine of strict separation of
powers. The legislative body and the
executive work independently. This
separation leads to friction of powers
and results in a lot of wrangling over
the overlapping of duties.
Majors Are Poor Economy.
"The mayor is generally a local
business man. He is usually so en
sued in his private business that he
does not have time to attend to city
affairs, and when he does it, it is us
ually with an unenthusiastlc, sluggish
feeling of obligatipn. One cannot ex
pect a major who gets only $300 a
year to gie any more time to city af
fairs; one cannot expect him to let his
business lag for the benefit of the city;
or one cannot expect him to work
with any great amount of enthusiasm.
"He is not acquainted with scientific
management The modern city,

demands a man to manage affairs who

ticular line. The city suffers from
"lis inefficient administration. The
only economy such a situation in

one step further than the mayor

one commission, but It failed to secure

Managers Should Be Experts.
"To abolish the defect of the com
mission form and yet to retain the
pleasing features of that system, the
third type of government was pro
posed. This is the city manager plan,
which centers responsibility and se
cures the services of experts for the
administration of the affairs of the
municipality.
"The plan proUdes for a commis
sion elected by the people of the city,
similar to the commission plan. The
other agency, which the commission

form lacks, is a trained expert who
is hired by the commission after due
advertising for an examination of ap
pilcants for this position. In many
cities the manager has been brought
in from the outside.
Manager System Mas Check.
"The commission has charge of de
termining the policy of the adminis
tration; the city manager carries out
these policies. The city manager ap
points a number of assistants. They
are all responsible to him, he is re
sponsible to the commission and the
commission is responsible to the peo
ple. If an assistant doies not do his
work well, he is discharged by the
manager, if the manager proves inef
ficient the commission discharges
him.
"The system brings in the business
methods of well-organized business
houses. The board of directors Hie
tate the policy of the house, the than
ager and his assistants carry out the
policies.
"The system can be compared to
the public school system, the board of
education dictates the policies, ap
points the superintendent to carry
out those policies. The superintendent
is always judged by and chosen be
cause of his ability and experience. If
he proves inefficient, the board dis
charges him.
High Salary Is Paid.
"The manager is paid a high sal
ary, but the increased expenses for
salaries will probably be offset by
economics in other directions. The
salary of a city manager of Columbia
should be about $2,000 a year.
"Seventy-five cities have adopted
this plan, and it is working well. Day
ton, Ohio, is the largest city, Spring
field, O., is the second largest city.
There is no doubt, judging by its suc
cess in other cities, that it would work
well here. We want the legislature to
permit cities of the third class to es
tablish this form. That is the pur
pose of our bill. It does not compel.
but permits cities to adopt this city
manager plan."
Figures show that Springfield saved
$50,000 the first year and also wiped
out a floatine debt of $100,000. The
street cleaning department was en
larged, and garbage collection was ex
tended to all houses.
La Grande, Ore., paid $75,000 in the
first sixteen months ot the existence
ot the manager plan, after its war
rants had depreciated to such an ex
tent that the banks refused to accept
them.

23 TRANSFER TO AID
Christmas Tree Custom Was
Abandoned for More Ef

The co-operation of the Elks' Club
and the Friendly Visiting Committee
has resulted in the preparation of a
sufficient number of Christmas bas
kets to supply all those whose names
have been reported to those in charge
of the Christmas giving.
The 23 Transfer Company yester
day offered free the services of a
truck and a driver to distribute the
baskets for the Elks Club. "The
truck helps us greatly in the distri
bution," said Will Garth, a member of
the committee last night, "and the ma
chine will be piled high when the start
is made. Between twenty and thirty
families will be visited, and we shall
distribute about a ton of food."
Lakenan Price, Kirk Hayes and W.

bution. They will be accompanied by
six other members.
airs. W. T. Stephenson, chairman of
the Friendly Visiting-Committee, andf
in charge of its soliciting, said that
the people visited have been generous
both with food and money. Seventy
six baskets have been prepared, and
the committee will try to supply every
family, whose name has been reported,
with one basket. The baskets con
tain chicken, bread, cake, fruit,
igetablcs, flour and cereals. They
are attractively arranged. Miss Bertha
Hamilton, visiting nurse, and D. E.
Major supplied the solicitors with the
The baskets to be distributed by the
Elks' Club contain 25 pounds of flour;
12 pounds of meal; a 6-pound beef
roast; 5 pounds ot beans; 3 pounds of
lard; 2 pounds of coffee; a can of baking-powder;
a can of syrup; 5 pounds
of hominy; a peck of apples; 6
pounds of sugar; a pound of candy
and some salt. These provisions were
bought at the Columbia stores, and
no partiality has been shown in the
buying. It was the intention of the
Elks to divide the buying and have
each store help in arranging the bas
kets, members of the Club will be at
the stores when this is done, and the
baskets will be collected from the
stores.
It has been the custom, formerly,
to hae an annual Christmas tree, but
it is thought that more families can
be reached by the method used this.

at least one-third of the families who
need support. The Friendly Visitors

ces of the day. "Those who are to re
ceive baskets from the Friendly Visit

"are by no means objects of charity
and are all deserving." She expressed
the desire, in behalf of the Commit
tee, that there would be no disap

able names were obtained.
Shortly after January 1 the Elks'
Cub will have an old clothes social,
to which everyone is requested to take
clothes to be given to those who need
them.

the Wall street fluctuations following
the interpretation ot President Wil

It was stated that exceptional care
will be taken hereafter against leaks
of information from Washington that
might cause price fluctuation. Gov
ernment men admitted that they were
concerned over the fact that the press
in some cities made intimations ot the
note before Its publication. The in
formation that the note had gone was
given In strictest confidence to the
newspaper men Wednesday morning.
Shortly afterward the news in more or
less definite form was in Wall street.
Because of this the government is
anxious to weed out any newspaper
men or anyone passing as a newspaper
man, who may have been serving as
"tipsters" for the street.
