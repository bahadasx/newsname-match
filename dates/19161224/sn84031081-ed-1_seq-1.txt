suffering from pernicious anemia Ml

was gradually lifted from the dangT

declared his patient would he l:i von 1

"I will no back to my state .apilal

Evening Papers ' cf Berlin -Object
to References to Repar

Not Be Discussed,
BY MORNING JOURNAL 1PICIAL LIASID W,
Berlin, Dec. 23 (by Wireless to Say
ville). The overseas News agency
gives out for publication comments
appearing in the evening papers on
the recent speech made by the British
prime minister, I.loyd-Ceorge. The
agency says that the papers consider
as the most important points of the
speech, Mr. Lloyd-( leorge's demand
for "restitution, reparation and guar
antees"; and, second, Mr. Lloyd
(ieorge.'s declaration that he fears the
central powers might entrap the pip
fente by their peace offer. It contin
ues: "The Deutsche Zeitung considers
Lloyd-George's words as full confirm
ation of the annexationist program
advocated by representatives of the
entente, and enumerates the parls of
the territory of the central powers
which, according to this program, the
members of the entente wish to con
quer and annex, as, for instance, Con
stantinople, which the entente has
promised to the Russians.
Sees HHiisal lo NcXiHiate.
"The Vossische eitung asks wheth
er Lloyd-George fears he may be en
trapped because he is forced to recog
nize the strength of Germany, and
because It is known that the entente
has been unable to change the pres
ent war situation.
"The Berliner Tagehlatt, with ref
erence to the same utterance, says
that either Lloyd-George has a poor
opinion o( the ability of British di
plomacy or wants to lay the blame
at the door of the central powers if
ihe entente declines their offer of
peace negotiations. The Tagehlatt
adds that apparently Lloyd-George
has the same object if the pe ice con
ditions of the entente arc embodied
in the already mentioned ambiguous
words, by which really nothing is
meant but the humiliation of tier
many." ManH"i Talk of PM.
The Kolnische Volks Zeitung and
the Hamburger Fremdenblatt point
cut that the British premier, In his
recent speech, attempted til avoid the
question at issue, and finds pretexts
egainst the offer of the central pow
ers. They are quoted as sayinK:
"While the central powers were the
first that dared to pronounce the
word 'peace' and invite the world to
a discussion of the future, Lloyd
Georec turns his back, reopens dis
cussions about the past, and the
causes of the war. inns, i.m.wi-
George implicitly declines the otfer
mode by the central powers and at
the same time wants to hold them
responsible in the eyes of the vvorld
if the war continues. I.lo'-d George
would rather pronounce judgment in
his own case than accept the idea of
a decision of a conference."
