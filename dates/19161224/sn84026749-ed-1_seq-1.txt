WOULD SEND ENVOY TO U.S.
London Observer Also Proposes
Peace Conference in Paris.
Must Answer Overtures.
LONDO.V, Dec. M.-Lord North
cllffo's Weekly Dispatch, the Sunday
newapapcr which la closest to the
new administration In Dngland, today
bitterly arraigns President Wilson, de
claring his course In sending the pea
note "an Insult not easily to be con-y
doned when he suggests that Britain
and Germans In a general way are fight
ing for the iatno cause."
The same newspaper placed big head
lines over a Nsw York message1 at
tributing President Wilson' act largely
to Oerman Ambassador' Bernstorffs
clever propaganda work, and comment
ed at length on the failure of the Drll
lsh to cope with this propaganda.
"A Memorable Mlatakc.
J. L. Garvin In a sU-coluran Article In
today's Observer cails President Wil
son's note "a memorable mistake which
Jeopardises sll the beneficent possibili
ties of the role which might have been,
end may stilt be, reserved for the Amer
ican iVesldent nt a later stage."
He holds that the entente allies, In
reply to President Wilson's note, am
bound to vindicate their cause before
history, and declares that special
measures'are rro,lred. t
"If Viscount Bryce Is not AYAllabln
to specially represent us In the Unit
ed States," says tho paper, "why
should not Lord Itosebery be asked?
Would It not bn possible' for thesr
two to go together? Perbapa the

atllea, to define their tarms and, oh -

celved, and demands a reasoned an
awer. While It might be explained to
the President that In the very nature
of the rase no speedy reply could
given to so considerable a request s
a full statement of thn terms of the
allies, the latter might do worse, In
our opinion, than appoint a special
body sitting In Paris to go Into the
question."
VICTORY FOR VVUSON SEEN
Belief Crowing Among Diplomats
Overtures Will ie Successful.
In spite of e'dltorlal blasts from
abroad, supplemented by guarded ex
pressions of annoyance In entente?
quarters here, belief Is growing In em
bassy and official circles, that Presi
dent Wilson's overtures to the bellig
erent nations are destined to be suc
cessful, l
It Is believed that no leas than n
Jrank expression In reply to his com.
municaiion ran oe expccieu, no n
this conies the way will he opened.
It Is declared, to further and more
definite negotiations. 0
Administration leaders are not In
clined to be overconcerned About the
editorial attitude of thn Kngllsh press.
It Is felt here that an accurate per
spective Is Impossible on the reception
of thn President's note until It hs
reached the public and sufficient time
haa been given for thorough diges
tion, y.
Await Official Views.
lu the meantime, Interchange ul
official views between the entente na
tions and among the Teutonlo powers
must be Awaited.
A pretty fair Indication ot how the
peace wind Is blowing' is expected
when the entente allies send their
reply to their enemies' peace proposal
looked for In about ten days.
But It Is pointed out that the tone
of this reply will necessarily be vast
ly different from the response to the,
President's communication. No word
has been received here as to when'
this response will come.
It Is believed the first reply will
come from the Teuton allies.
Diplomats Disease Issue.-
While attention la directed toward
England for the next move In the In
tricate game of peace, there contin
ues to be vast discussion of the sub
ject In embassy circles here.
In this connection the Sooth Amer
ican ministers believe the President
haa given tremendous Impetus to
peace activity.
"The United States" note. was time
ly," one of thp most' prominent South
Americans declared. "It waa put
forth when tho people of belligerent
countries have their hearts and minds
on pence wort; than At any time In the
last two years.
"By .calling for a statement of ob
jectives from both sides, the Presl
dent Is bound to get the fullest and
frankest expressions developed thus
far in thn struggle,
"By asking for terms the President
automatically has assumed very
much tho position of mediator.
"Any replies sent to lilin will neces
ssrlly meun continuation of the thrrt
cornered discussion and, If tho replies
from tho two belllgtrcitt groups
squam In any particular whatever,
It will result In encou.aglng further
efforts.
