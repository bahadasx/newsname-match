Bunker Aids Cupid
Assists Chicago Couple in Get

Train in Here is Late.
Capt. Guy I... Dunker and Deput"
County Clerk Charles M. Raab col
laborated In a little cupid stunt Sat
urday night and brought much joy
to a happy couple from Chicago.
About S:30 o'clock Capt. Bunker
answered a phone call from a man
who said that he had arrived in
South Bend too late to secure a mar-
liage license and wanted to know if
the captain knew whether he could
get one so late in the evening.
Filled with the Yuletlde spirit the
captain gracefully told his party to
wait while he got in touch with his
relative. Finally everything was ar
ranged satisfactorily and the couple
met Raab at the court house where
a license was issued about 9 o'clock.
James Winslow was the name iho
man gave and he told the clerktliat
he formerly lived here, being em
ployed by Ioughman and Lough
man. The woman gave her name as
Minnie M. Annis. a sister of Frank
Warden, 311 S. Franklin st., at
whose home the couple was married
by Rev. H. I Davis.
Roth parties denied that they
were running away and blamed all
their trouble on trains that were
hours late. Mrs. Winslow was wait
ing for her husbanc while a crowd
of relatives and friends were also
kept waiting.

er man stress
on Lloyd George
Speech is Biting
Asodated Press Service.
RE REIN (via wireless to Say
ville, Dec. 2. The Overseas News
agency gives out for publication
comments appearing in the evening i
papers on the recent speech made by j
the Rritish prime minister, Mr.
Eloyd-George. The agency says that
the papers consider as the two most!
important points of the speech
Lloyd-George's demand for
tution, reparation and guarantees,"
and second Mr. Lloyd-George's dec
laration that he fears the central
powers might entrap the entente by ;
their peace offer. It continues:
"The Deutsche Tages Reitung con
siders Eloyd-George's words as full
confirmation of the annexationist
program advocated by representa
tives of the entente and enumerates
the parts of the tcnitory ot the cen
tral powers, which according to this
program, the members of the entente
wish to conquer and annex, as for in
stance, Constantinople, which the
entente has promised to the Rus
sians. "The Vossische Zeitung asks
whether Lloyd-George fear: he may
be entrapped because he is forced to
recognize the strength of Germany
and because it is known that the en
tente has been unable to change
the present war situation.
"The Rerliner Tageblatt, with ref
erence to the same utterance, says
that either Lloyd-George has a poor
opinion of the ability of Rritish dip
lomacy or wants to lay the blame at
the feet of the central powers if the
entente decline their offer of peace
negot.ations.
The Tageblatt adds that apparent
ly Lloyd-George has the same ob
ject if the peace negotiations of
peace are embodied in the already
mentioned ambiguous words, by
which really nothing is meant but
the humiliating of Germany."
ROMAN PAPIER CALLS XOTI2

ROME (via Paris), Dec. 23. The
Popolo Romano, in its comment on
Pres't Wilson s note to the belliger
ents, alludes to Its issuance as the
great world event of the day.

The Paris and London press, this
newspaper thinks, has not caught
the true meaning of the ncte, and it
expresses belief that after mature
consideration it will find its first
impression altered, at least in part.
Indeed, adds the Popolo Romano, it
4s unwise to give the impression
that the entente allies are wounded
by the president's note, which it says
asks In the main the Intentions of
each f roup of belligerents to ascer

LONDON PAPER SAYS WILSON

LONDON. Dec. 2 4. The Sunday
Observer, commenting on what it
terms "A memorable mistake which
jeopardizes all the beneficent pos
sibilities of the role which misht
have been and may still be reserved
for the American president at a
later stage," holds that the entente
allies in reply to Pres't Wilson's
note, are bound to vindicate their
cause before history, and declares
that special measures are required.
"If Viscount Bryce is not avail
able specially to represent us in the
Cnited States," says the paper, 'why
should not Lord Rosebery be asked?
would it not be possible for these
two to go together? perhaps the
best choice would be Mr. Asquith.

Private Charity Under Organ

Parts of City and In

South Rend has ever known!
Happiest for the merchants for
never before was there such a tre
mendous holiday trade; happiest for
(the manufacturers and business men
in general for never before was there
such prosperity, never before such
bright prospects for the coming
year; happiest for the workers, for
never before have their employes i
been so generous with their bonuses
and salary increases and Christmas
gifts; happiest even for the poor and
the unfortunate, for never has the
spirit of Christmas giving, of Christ
mas generosity, been so pronounc
ed. There will not be a home in the
city, at leas-, none that have been
heard of, that will not have some
Christmas cheer. Every appeal for
help has been answered. The pros
perous have opened their purses
and wherever poverty and want has
been found, something has been
done to relieve it.
That undefinable something, call
ed for want of a better definition
the Christmas spirit, has never been
so pronounced here. There has been
more Christmas giving than ever be
fore and especially have the poor,
and the sick, and the unfortunate
been well taken care of.
Everybody Gives.
Five hundred baskets weighty with
pood things that bring cheer on
Christmas day have been distribut
ed by the Associated Charities alone.
Fifty baskets were given out by the
Salvation Army. The Rescue Mis
sion. The St. Vincent de Paul so
ciety, the churches throughout the
city, high school students, and In
dividuals without number, have
joined in bringing comfort and hap
piness Into the homes of the poor.
No call for help has been left un
heeded, for, although the calls were
more numerous than ever before,
due to the high cost of living, and
the large amount of sickness now
prevalent in the city, the pivers have
been more numerous than ever be
fore and the gifts more generous.
The hearts of nearly a hundred
newsies were gladened by the abun
dent gifts which they found on the
Christmas tree set for them Saturday
evening at the Y. M. O. A. by the
newspapers of the city. The L'OO
orphans at the Orphans' home will
have a Christmas never to be for
gotten. The festivities there began
Friday night and will continue rieht
on through until the last piece of
candy is eaten, th last bit of the
Christmas dinner has disappeared,
and the last toy is destroyed. The
116 unfortunates at the county farm
will have such a dinner Sunday as
they have not eaten in years. At the
Salvation Army home, 35 "derelicts
of society", who, are nevertheless
able to pupport themselves by odd
jobs, will feast. Even the Inmates of
the jails and the municipal lodging
house will not be forgotten.
Private Generosity Organized.
