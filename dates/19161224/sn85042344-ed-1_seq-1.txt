practical nnd detailed statement from
each of the governments nddiessed.

N:Vorthctoss. the naming of these
terms will afford a basis of iieirntln

conflicting forces can converge. N'"'
is any embarrassment seen to any of
the nations in naming such terms. It
is understood In advance that they are
apt to fluctuate with the military

The country is not committed to any

SANTA CLAUS VISITS
THE SUNDAY SCHOOLS
Christmas Will Be Universally
Observed in the Local
" Churches.
Practically eveiy Sunday school in
Tulsa has (lone or will do its share j
toward makli.R Christmas memorable f
in the minds of the little folks, with
not a little attention to the prownups,
Most of them will have a tree with:
Kood old Santa in charKc, and it is:
certain that no one will be overlooked j
or sliKhted. This is the one day in ;
the year that all the Sunday school I
children count to nnd from it Is thel
red letter (lay of the ralendai and It
is iiilte frequent for the attendance
at Bible schools to climb up somen hat I
when this event Is in prospect. I
At the first Alethodist church, Inj
addition to the children's proKram In1
tho mornlnit. tho pastor will talk'
about tho "Spirit of Christmas," and
a special musical treat will be pro
vided. In tho evenini; the usual
worship hour will lie turned over to
the musicians, who, among other
things, will present a cantata. At
draco church the morning will be the
children's festival, but sermons nnd
music for the day will deal with
Christmas topics. TiKcrt .Memorial
has arranged all Its services In keep
ing with the day. Orcutt will be no
exception, but the character of t lie
observance has not hciii announced.
At l'resh)tcrlii.
The First Presbyterian will have Its
children's celebration at 7:30 p. m.,
one feature of which will be the read
Inn' from "Iten-llur" telling of the
birth of the Savior. The I'nlted Pres
byterians will have their exercises at
the usual Sunday school hour, ltiilletto
will have a Christmas tree and all tho
other services will be appropriate.
College Hill has a program of services
that breathes tho Chiisnias spirit in
every event, while Cherokee Heights
will tako care of tho kiddies in the
afternoon.
At tho First Unptlst cburch the
evening will bo turned over to the
young people and tho choir and
nuiFlc will be the dominant feature.
Second baptist, Immanuel and West
Tulsa churches have failed to make
any announcement of their intentions.
To dive Cantata.
The Christian church will have Its
treat at the end of the Sunday school
hour, while the pastor and choir will
exert themselves to make eveiybody
appreciate tho day. A cantata will be
given at the evening hour, and those
who know tho ktnd of .music that is
usually heard at this church are look
ing for an exceptional pleasure.
The Lutherans are making a special
attempt to build up their Sunday
school and nothing will bo allowed to
Interfere with that feature. In the
evening, hrfwever, their treat will take
plare. No preaching services will be
held.
Trinity Kplscopal will observe the
occasion in a characteristic way with
a celebration of the holy communion
at midnight, Christmas eve. Monday
morning at 8 o'clock there will be
services and communion.
, At Holy Family Catholic church
the Christmas services begin at mid
night. The sacred allegory will be
presented with appropriate music.
Masses will be said at 12 Sunday night
and at 7 and 8:30 Monday, with high
mass and sermon at 10.

A Word of Appreciation I'roni The
World to I he (Milieus of Tulsa.
Chrinmas of 191C is not only u
happy occasion as is common with
that fesilval, but this year we have n
il eeiul reason to be joyful. Proipcr
r.y has Messed the country In an un
usual degree. People who hive had
to pinch befuie to celebrate the season
are speiding money freely this tlmr.
The poor, whom we have always with
us. are getting better nttctith.n than
ever before. Christmas is no louver
essentially an excuse for celebrating in
Hie gratification of persona! loiuiingii.
but has taken on more of the s 1 1 it of
the Chi 1st In whoso Honor it wvi
named. We are learning that this is
the time of all times when It I ehovei'
us to censider the welfare of others
t specially others not so fortunately
pi ued, rather than our own gratifica
tion. It is better to fc'ive than re
ceive, and It is still better when that
giving is to those w ho are not expected
to give in return, far belter than
swapping presents, as has been the
past custom, is the idea of bringinf
happiness to those who have not hud
a fair chance to know what happi
ness Is.
Tulsa, too, is prosperous, which Is a
habit with our people. And Tulsa Is
not selfish with her prosperity. She
Is anxious to i hure that prosperity, n"l
i nly to the extent of helping her own
unfortunate, but glories in the good
things that come to other people and
other communities. Tulsa Is a good
Pluce to live In, a good place, to do
I usiness In and a good place to hail
from when you are traveling in ol'ier
parts of thla great nation. Tulsa is
tho topic of admiring conversations In
any part of the country wherever ou
may go, not only because it is a won
der city In Its pronress, Its prosperity,
its cleanliness o( appearance and Its
up-to-dateness, but because Its ppopk
have ft municipal heart and that heart
heats for the Rood of all humanity.
Itu advance In population, its ama.ing
bank clearings, its great woalth, lis
i en illness to furnish the funds fur
every object that makes life :iot'e
worth living, havo set a mark for
( ther cities to strive to attain. Wc ar
truly proud of Tulsr. and glail to own
It as our homo and the nearest tlilinr
to -the promised land tloit this eaJ tn
affords.
As an Integral part of Tulsa, wrapped
up Indlssolubly in Its welfare and do
oted to Its advancement, The World
feels the Joy of that cicdltuble record
as In part due to Its efforts. This
paper bus not been run on the prin
ciple of catering to transient senti
ment, nor of pandering to prejudice
or fanat.clsm. It has not hesitated to
ttlck to fundamental principles evon
when financial advantage and prestige
might have been gained by a dlffei
ent course. It ha gone steidilv on
Its way, consistently battling for what
It deemed to be right, even In the face
of occasional condemnatien and stupid
misrepresentation from those who
ought to have held up Its hunds. We
ar'o not bragging on our record, for it
Is a matter of coutse, and we expec
