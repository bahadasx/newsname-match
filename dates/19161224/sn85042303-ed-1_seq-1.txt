WANDERERS WHO HAVE BEEN
TIPPED OFF THAT ARDMORE IS
A GOOD PLACE TO "G.1T BY,"
GOING TO BE SURPRISED.
ludge Doyle has ruled that Munici

when the niuximum penalty provides
fur a Jail sentence, and as a result
the municipal court in Oklahoma City
is "up In the uir" and tiie police force
has been reported t be rather inac

the papers that several bad actors
Alio were in t lie city basiil had been
berated and were making life miser-
ble for the police department, that
that portion of tlicni who chose to
rrmain in the rity after their liber

climes however, and are reported to
he headed south. Pome are likely to
land in Ardmore but according to the
police department they ape going to
find a different reception than they
probably ixpeit. The clue: of po

mayor, nre planning to make life so
Interesting for the weary Willies that
they will not care to make Ardim-re
headquarters for Te winter. Th;1 city
court stales that when a .-entent e is
imposed it will not be the purpose of
the court to provide a warm place and

to put tl.elr time on the streets of the

This rd'rt.will have a tendency
keep that class og gentry who are on
the lookout for a good place to spend

and this Is just what the city officials
desire.

SITED EDITOR
IFAljJ
HENRY J. ALLEN OF THE WICHI
TA DEACON HAH SOUNDED THE
FIRST KNELL OF THE PRESENT
PRIMARY SYSTEM.
Kansas City. Jin, Dir. 22. In his
speech on "What Ails (lovei iiinent"
Is fore the Knife and Fork club of this
city, last night. Henry ,1. Allen, editor
of the Wichita llcaion. declareil that
V ovoi'tiiiienl is the only human ac
tivity of any amount which Is perpet
ually in the hands or amateurs" mid
that "we have dropped Into the iin
nilral habit of lielievini; that if a
man has ever failed ni every other
activity In lite it is it soil of sign thai
he ought to be given a chance us a
public, servant."
"If we selected crooks by popular
election," continued Mr. Allen, "we
should starve. And if cashiers and
business managers were chosen by ii
general ballot, bankruptcy would be
the rule nod success the rare excep
tion. After discussing tbj "indifferent
lethargy of citizenship'' In regard to
political affairs Mr. Allen referred l
a program, started by citizens of Kan
sas through which they hope to Im
prove the present system of govern
ment In that stute.
"Instead of asking tho voters at
large to choose the clerks, treasurer
and experts in tho county unit, ut a
iinpiihir primary," Mr. Allen contin
ued, "lliey will neek lu provide tor the
diminution from tho bullot of all tho
clerical positions; shortening the bal
lot to include three commissioners
chosen from the electorate nt large,
ami the district judges. The commis
sioners, under n civil service regula
tion, will fhen hire ut proper clerical
wages whatever clerical 'help tho
county needs.
"Auditors, county clerks, district
clerks, sheriffs, leisterers of deed.
surveyors, assessors, engineers unit
others who are now selected from a
piiiuary ballot, which often contains
the lame and tho halt and the blind
of the community, will lie chosen by
Hie commissioners, n ml chosen for
their ability to serve. Ily the short-
eiiim; of the ballot and the emphasii
placed upon the few who ure chosen
by popular selection, we will elimin
ate evils, of Die primal V.
We save a million dollars n year hi
Kansas on the cost of county govern
ment alone. Kfflcii licy, experience
ni expert knowledge will take tho
place of political incapacity Jin I
clerical inexperience. We have dis
covered iliat the people will not take
the time to select experts. 'I bey do
intelligently select governing boards.
"The Kan.-ni program contemplates
,lt-o a shortening of the nt.ile billot
in conformity wiih the same philoso
phy. In Kansas In the last election,
flu. mill people voted upon nothing but
president iul eh etuis; many thousands
voted for pre siilcnlial electors and the
governor nnd then unit. The t lerlenl
officera elected for the state govern
ment ran far behind the heads of the
til ket. Why? Because the people
did not know the candid:. Ics for the
eli rii al pi: ;itions. They were not in
terested in them. The new program
pi eposes to f liniinate all (ierieal po
sit! ins iiii-l eiei t the governor of the
-tate nnd the n eiuliers of the hu
liienie (our! ii tnl give the governor
i the power of i hoo. ir.g the beads of
! the other liepartnieiiis. This will not
J only presi nt a more euni i:-o obliga
tion i'ii the p. nt of the governor. It
will save iiione'.. l'i:.!i r the present
law the socre'arv of st ile, in states
like Kan -as. gels J i.onn a year but
