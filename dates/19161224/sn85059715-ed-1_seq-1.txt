CBT ASSOCIATED PSCSS)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.?Informa
lion as to their exact meaning in seek
the whole purpose of the note ad
dressed to all the belligerents by Pres
ident Wilson. The United States de
sires a full, practical and detailec
statement from each of the govern
ments addressed. This outline, anc
what follows, was stated officially today
for the administration:
This government docs not know ant
feels that it has been given no rea
means of knowing, of what terms
would be required by each of the bel
ligcrents to make peace. It regard!
the recent speeches of the leadin*
statesmen in all countries as vagut
and undefined and sees nothing ii
them that would enable a conferenct
to draw up a treaty. All speak of th<
rights of small nations, the repugnanct
of conquest, and the guarantees of ;
permanent peace, but no one natioi
h^s yet gone into what it means b:
those phrases in a way that the government
of the United States can un
derstand.
Wants France to Tell.
Recent press comment has been tak
en to enhance that vagueness. France
for?instance, has not disclosed if wha
it considers a just peace means the
evacuation of its northern provinces
or in addition to that the restoration o;
Alsace-Lorraine, or if in addition ic
both those claims it expects a monej
indemnity for the damage of invasion
or beyond that if it has an actual pro
gram for doing away with so-callec
German militarism. In short, th<
United States asks what would it accept
today as the basis of peace.
Similar issues apply io all the bellig
erent nations merely in a varyin?

S3 is their details. As the largest neutra
j? lacing grave problems, and as tin
friend of all parties concerned, thi
United States feels most earnestly tha
if is entitled to know those facts. Un,
less some one of the groups lays dowi
its actual terms, there will he no basi:
for negotiation and no possibility o
peace till the world is bled whole
officials declare.
Wants Starting Place.
There is not the slightest expecta
tion here that the terms laid down wil
be reconcilable at first. It Is knowi
that some of the nations will demani
what in actuality is impossible. Nev
erthcless the naming of those term:
will: afford a basis of negotiition, :
starting place from which the con
dieting interests can begin to converge
Nor is any embarrassment seen t
any of the nations in naming siicl
terms. It is understood in advanc
th*v thev arc ant fluctuate with th
military changes and are not permit
cntly binding under new, conditions
"Whatever any nation feels must be in
eluded in its terms for moralness ca:
also be added to the terms without em
barrassment, it is said.

officially declared that the Unite

on President Wilson's note to
