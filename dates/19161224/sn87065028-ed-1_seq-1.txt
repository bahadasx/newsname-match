the future, as would m; ke it possible
frankly to com pure tin m."
Wholly without notice and cntiTc
ly "contrary to what administration
official tiave described us his course,
the president dispatched notes to till
the belligerent and lor all the neu
trals for their information. Sum
marized in the president's own words
as contained in the notes, his atti
tude is as follows:
"The president is not proposing
peace; he is not even offering media
tion. He is merely proposing that
sounding be taken in order that we
may learn, the neutral nations with
the belligerent, how near the haven
of peace may be for which all man
kind longs with an intense and in
creasing longing. He believes that
. ihc npirjt i? vth He. scales .and thg
objects which he seeks will be under
stood by all concerned, and he con
fidently hopes for response which
will bring a new light into the af
fairs of the world."
This latest development in the
Tapidly moving, world events toward
a discussion of peace was not per
mitted to become known until Wed
nesday night, when the notes were
well on their way to the American
ambassadors in the belligerent capi
tals, and probably already in the
hands of some of them.
It was a most distinct surprise to
x nil official Washington, which had
been led to believe that with the for
mal transmittal .of the proposals of
. the central powers the offices of the
United States would awHit further
moves between the belligerents them
selves and "that certainly, in view of
the speech pf Premier Lloyd-George
and the announcements in Russia,
Trance and Italy, further action by
neutrals would depend upon the next
careful and delicate move of the bel
ligerents. The whole tenor of official opinion
throughout Washington, when . the
president's action became known,
was that it immeasurably improved
the prospects for some sort of ex
changes looking toward an approach
of peace discussions between the bel
ligerents, without impairing the posi
tion of the United States should they
finally be unable to find a ground on
which to approach one another.
At the White House no statement
whatever could be obtained as to
whether any of the powers even had
intimated how they would receive tr.e
note and there was every indication
that the same careful secrecy which
wevented anything whatever be
coming known about the president's
action until it had been taken, would
niTound nnv of the succeeding
moves.
Nowhere on the surface appears
any indication of the history-making
events which diplomatists generally
are convinced must have transpired
since the German allies brought forth
their proposals, to dispel the general
lv prevalent belief that such an ac
. lion on the part of President Wilson
would be unacceptable to the entente
m
powers.
British embJNsy officials declared
they were utterly taken by surprise,
were wholly unable to explain it, and
were emphatic in their declaration
that no 'exchanges whatever had
passed through the embassy here as
a preliminary. (
Themany friends of Mrs. H. J.

while both teams will join in a big
meeting which is scheduled to be

dition to the agronomists mentioned,
each team will be accompanied by a
business man and a banker from Me
business man and a banker from
Memphis, ami these gentlemen will
speak on the relations between far
mers, bankers and merchants.
The main objective of the cam
paign will be four-fold, and the fol
lowing program adopted by the com
mittee will be followed at each meet
ing; 1. Business Mun How a spirit of
close co operation can be built up be
tween the business man and the far
mer through the provision of markets
for corn, oats, hay. peas, beans, po
tatoes, poultry products, and other
staple produce.
2. Banker How the banker can
give assistance to the smalt farmer
throuirh financial aid, encouragement
and co-operation.
3. Specialist--How special lines
can be fitted into the general scheme
of farming and general agricultural
program for the state.
4. Team Leader and Agronomist
Timely farm problems and opera
tions. According to Mr. Wilson stress will
be put on (1) the kind of crops to
grow for next year and the proper
preparation for them; (2") intelligent
nnd conservative livestock raising
and dairying; (.1) marketing general
farm produce; and ( 4 1 'terracing and
drainage.
Under the first division especial at
tention will be given to the growing
of soy beans and velvet beans. Di
rector Lloyd states that the oil mills
of the state have agreed to take all
the beans grown at a minimum price
of 7ft cents a bushel with higher
prices probable. At present they are
paying $1.25 a bushel. Velvet beans
are becoming in -'-'j' ' '-nortant.
J. W. Willis, a, ,r th . north
Mississippi district, styted tnat both
soy beans and velvet beans can be
successfully grown in his territory,
and during the campaign the farmers
will be urged to plant velvet beans
on their thin land, and soy beans ..n
the better grade land. Both these
crops have proven splendid hog and
cattle feeds.
In the livestock and dsiry work,
according to an announcement by I.
W. Carpenter, livestock specialist, the
use of pure bred bulls will be advo
cated and bankers of the territory
covered by the campaign will be
asked to co-operate with the farmers
by advancing money without interest
for three years to buy these bulls.
This practice has already been adopt
ed by the banker in some counties
of north Mississippi.
The 200 Americans detained in .
Syria and Palestine by the Turkish
military authorities have been grant
ed permission to leave via Beirut, on
con.lition that they intern at Beirut
for a month to make valueless any
military information they may have.
Some of the Americans are mission
aries and others naturalized citizens.
