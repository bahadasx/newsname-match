Fire which was discovered yesterday
morning at about .v o'clock, iii the
Home for Needy < Confederate Women.
caused damage to the amount of $l.*..000
and drove the thirty-two aged inmates
to seek ."shelter elsewhere. The discov

cipiency, probably navd the lives of a
number of the women who make their
home there. Prompt response by the
firemen and 11.?- heroic; work of police
men and citizens saved both the in
mates of th?* home from injury and the
property from total destruction. The
home Is at 3 East" (Jrace '.Street.
The fire was discovered by Miss Hlox
ton when her attention was attracted
by the fulling of a piece of blazing
wood into a near-by yard. She at once
wnt to the third floor and opened the
<loor of the trunk room. Flames and
smoke belched forth. She shimmed the
door and rushed to the telephone. 'I he
firemen were summoned and she began
getting her charge;*, out of their beds
and out <-f the building. So coolly did
she perform her task that all were
taken from the building without in
jury.
Patrolman K. T. Dunn, of the Sec
ond Precinct Station, ami .1. I.- Walker,
of 504 North Twenty-fifth Street, an
employee of the Chesapeake and Po
tomac Telephone Company, rendered
valuable service. The men rushed
through the dense smoke atul assisted
;? number of the inmates to escape
from the burning structure.

The several alarms, turned in from
the corner of Foushe? and 'Irace
Streets, brought the firemen out in a
hurry. Engine Company No. 4 and
Truck No. 1 were first on tlie scene,
followed in ijulck succession by Kngine
Companies Nos. .". ?? and ? and Tru* k
No. V. Willi the arrival of the first
apparatus. Fire Commissioner Robert
l.erky, .lr.. and II. S. Sycle and W. S.
Sye|?> appeared and assisted the. women
to escape. T. O. Heinrich. Scout mas
ter. formed a fire line and helped the
police to keep ba?-k the txcited crowd.
The building was thoroughly gutted,
and the thirty-two Inmates will be
without their abode until such time as
It is rebuilt. Firemen saved parts of
the building, but it is not believed that
the walls will sustain a new structure.
In the meantime, the Inmates are
being cared for by citizens of Rich
mond who have Thrown open then
floors to them. Thrice the number of
women would have found the doors of
the most palatial homes of the city
open to them.
The aped women were carried to the
home of P. R. Phillips. 7 East <irace

The damage to the building was
partially covered by insurance. The
real damage is the destruction of per
sonal articles, things which would have
been considered of priceless value in a
Confederate museum. Many of the
women had articles Intimately con
nected with the War Hetween the
States, articles of ante-bellum times ?
treasures that no money could buy.
These are ruined.
The board of directors of the home,
of which Mrs. A. .1 Montague is pres
ident. met yesterday afternoon. Mrs.
Montague was not present, having been
in Washington. She left for Rich
mond at once on hearing of the tire.
The board adopted resolutions thank
ing the citizens who have taken the
women of the institution into their
homes. They thanked the firemen for
their faithful work, and especially
thanked the matron. Miss Ploxton, for
her work.
The matter of Insurance was taken
up and it was stated that the Insurance
on the building is only $8,000. not
nearly enough to rebuild. There is no
way of learning the exact damage tin
til architects have gone over it and
made an estimate. There is some
doubt that the home can he rebuilt with
the present walls as a basis for con
struction.
The list of inmates, compiled by
Miss Rloxton. immediately after she
had assembled them in the home of Mr.
and Mrs. Phillips, for the purpose of
seeing if all had escaped, follows: Mrs
Fergusson. Mrs. Kenningham, Mrs.
Mitchell. Miss Hicks. Mrs. Owen, Mrs.
Talley, Mrs. McArthur. Miss Rriggs.

Fighting a. series of defensive bat

in Wallachia and Dobrudja are being
pressed backward to tbe north. Heavy

'of Rimnik-Sarat, midway between the
Muzeii ail') Sereth Rivers. in Wal
lachia. Russian ftdvanccil posts at
Rakovjtcheni, In the foothills of the
mountains west of Rimnik-Sarat. were
compelled to retire after battles at
that noint and at Vadulsoresoi. An
engagement at Ralatchenul, south of
Rimnik-Sarat, also is recorded, indi
cating that the Russian lines still
. protect that town.
These engagements are regarded by
some Teutonic military critics as an ,
effort on the part of the Russians and
the Roumanians to cover the retreat
of their armies and of the Roumanian j
refugees across the line of the .Sereth
River and to cover the flank of the
Russo-Roumanlan armies fighting in
the Carpathian Mountains of Moldavia.
In Dobrudja the Russo-Roumanian
defensive line is reported to have J
withdrawn northward until it Is only
thirteen miles south of the northern
extremity of that province.
Only artillery activity Is recorded on :
the Russian front in the vicinity of
Haranovif hi.
The hig guns arc active also In the '

was another parade on Monday, when
the paraders missed the King's palace

I.ONIXiX, December "It.?Analyzing
I ho criticisms .if President Wilson's
note t<> the bell igoren l nations, the
Manchester Guardian in a remarkable
editorial, a column long, which is
uni<iue because it endeavors to inter
pret the President's viewpoint, sounds
a word of cautIon to-day against hasty
and Ill-considered action In making a
reply.
The Guardian believes lh;it the note,
"if coolly considered and wisely an
sv?*erod can only help tiio allies' cause,
and throw into stronger relief th^
moral weakness of the German posi
tion." Th>- newspaper says that a ?-are
fill reading of the passage In which
President Wilson suggests that l>oth
sides are lighting for the same end
reveals that the President said that this
is what the helligoronts tell their own
countrymen, t'ontiniiitig, the Manches
ter (iuardian says: "t'inning on top of
? ?eriiiauy's suggestion of negotiations,
the not o appears to associate itself
with the ?iermaii view, and the refer
ence! to uoasu res which llio 1'nited
; States may have to lake reads at first
a little too liUe a suggestion of mon
Hce. However, it must he borne in
m!nd that a note coached in similar
1 if not Identical terms Is being sent to
all the belligerents, and if President
Wilson wants war with either side lie
cannot without departing from (he ap
pearance of strict, neutrality avoid ad
dressing the same words to the olher.
For our part. It will rorpilre the very
strongest evidence to persuade us that
iu the face of the great volume of
sympathy for the allied cause which
we are assured of i.u the other side of
the Atlantic, that any act seriously
prejudicial to our caurn can lie con
templated at Washington.

"Another passage in the note, which
comes in for even more criticism, also
acquires a different value so soon as
we bethink ourselves that it is ad
dressed to hoth parlies. This is the
passage which appears to suggest a
real identity <>f view? as between the
; belligerents. When the passage is
carefully read it is seen to say not
that the two belligerent parties have
the same views, or are lighting for the
, same ends, but that they profess to be
doing so when the governments justify
the war to their own countrymen. This
is a very different proposition, and the
passage, as read by a Herman of any
nutnor, might be taken as a se\ere
piece of sarcasm."
The Manchester Guardian then
sounds a warning against the "allies
being betrayed into playing Germany's
game, because if we put ourselves
wrong with America we do play Ger
many's game." The newspaper then
i adds this advice:
"l.et us avoid imputing motives, take
the President's note at its face value

f Hy Annoclated Pr?sa.I
^ ASrriXGTON*. December 23. In
formation as to their exact meaning In
seeking a "Just and permanent poace"
Is the whole, purpose of tho note ad
dressed to all the belligerents by
President Wilson. The United States
desires a full, practical and detailed
statement from cach of tho govern
ments addressed. This outline, and
what follows, was stated officially to
day for the administration.
This government does not know, and
feels that It has no real means or
knowing, what terms would he re
quired by each of the belligerents to
make peace. It regards tho reccnt
speeches of the leading statesmen in
all countries as vague and undefined,
and seen nothing In them that would
enable a conference to draw up r
treaty. All speak of the rights of
small nations, the repugnance of con
quest, and tho guarantees of a per
manent peace, but no one nation has
yet gone Into what it means hy those
phras?s In a way that the government
of the United States can understand.
Recont press comment has been taken
to enhance that vagueness, l'rnnce, for
Instance, has not disclosed if what
eho considers a just peace means tho
evacuation of her northern provinces,
or in addition to that tho restoration of
j Alsaoe-Uorraine, or if in addition to
, both those claims she expects a money
Indemnity for the damage of Invasion,
j or beyond th.it if she has an actual
| trogram for doing away with so-callcd
! German militarism. In short, the.
i United States asks what she would
I accept to-day as the basis for peace?

?Similar issues apply to all tiio
belligerent countries in merely a vary
ing form. What President Wilson
wants is the details. As tho largest
neutral facing grave problems, and as
the friend of all parties concerned, tho
United States feels most earnestly that
it is entitled to know those facts. Un
less some one of the groups lays dotvn
Its actual terms there will be no basis
i for negotiation, and no possibility of
peace until the world Is bled, officials
? declnrc.
The naming of those terms will form
a starting place from wmen tno con
flicting interests can begin to converge.
Nor is any embarrassment ?eon to any
of the nations In naming such terms.
' It is understood in advance that they
?Pl to fluctuate with the military
changes, and are not permanently
binding under new conditions. What
ever any nation feels must he included
in its terms for moral reasons can
also l?e added to th<? terms without
embarrassment, it is said.
As to permanent guarantees, it was
I officially declared that tho United
States stands ready to enter any kind
of International agreement that may
seem most deslra hlo to the nations,
whether permanent peace Is to be se
cured hy force. If necessary, or by
law. The country is not committed
to any one plan, and President Wilson
is entirely open to suggestions. It is
tho administration view that the coun
try can be committed to an abandon
ment of the policy of Isolation, such
as President Monroe committed it to
the Monroe Doctrine, without Senate
action. In tli^ plans so far contem
plated. however. It is nrobabl* tho
nations would he bound hy treaty
agreements which would necessarily
have to ho ratified hy the Senate, so
far as the I'nited States, is concerned.

\ fuller understanding of the em
barrassment caused to the administra
tion by (he coincidence of its note with
the Herman proposals was given to
day. when it was said that, despite th*
enrlj unfavorable effect, which the m.te
was expected t? have in the allied
countries through that fact, it was
decided t<? risk It. in view of tho
greater interests Involved. It Is -ex-->
peeled it may be some time before
the American viewpoint will be ac
cepted abroad, but If is felt lhat in
the end it certainly will prevail.
It also stated most emphatically that
the nolo was noi rushed off on Monday
in order t.. get Premier l.loyd ? Jrorge
before tie bad irrevocably committed
the allies against peace in his speech
to Parliament on Tuesday That as
sumption was foreseen, but officials
expect it to lose weight and Import-'
it nee as the first impressions wear off. 1
The early resentment in London and
Paris on the assumption that tho Pre*,
ident's note declared both belligerent*
were fighting for the same object i*
regaroed as unwarranted at the State .
Department, where to-day it was }<aid
great pains had been taken to avoid |
that very inference.
Stress was laid on the President'*'!
words to show that he had not ex
pressed any conviction that both nun
of belligerents were tiirhtliiK for the
same objects. On tho other hand, the
language of the noto, !t wa* pointed
