GARDNER AGAINST "I
MANN FOR SPEAKER
? Bay State Representative Is
Stirred by Support Given
' > "Kaiser's Wicked Cause."
WILL VOTE FOR LENROOT
Ttepresentative Augustus T\ Gardner
of Massachusetts lias started a merry
row in the House of Representatives
by issuing a statement in which he
declares himself an uncompromising
opponent of Representative Mann of
Illinois as Speaker of the House under
renuhl iran oreraniza tion. and has in
dorsed Representative Ren root of Wisconsin.
The Massachusetts representative
places his opposition to Representative
Mann on the ground that the minority
leader's expression of opinion on the
. President's note to the warring na*
tions "lias given encouragement to the
kaiser's wicked cause."
Until now, the House has been viewing
Representative Mann as Speaker
if the Tiext House is republican, with
the proviso that the independents and
"J radical progressives would have to he
? ' met half way on certain legislative
measures. Representative Gardner's
position has not been dreamed of until
now, nor has the European war situation
entered into the subject in the
least.
Mr. Gardner's Statement.
Representative Gardner, who can always
be counted upon to "start something"
of an unusual nature, issued a
statement in Cincinnati indorsing Representative
Lenroot, and the statement
reads:
"I have read the indorsement which
the leader of my party in Congress gave
yesterday to President Wilson's offer
of interference in European affairs.
This is the fourth or fifth time that
Reader Mann has given encouragement
to the kaiser's wicked cause. As far
as T am concerned I will tolerate such
leadership no longer. I believe that
the happiness of the world requires the
destruction of the dynasties of the
llapsburgs and the Hohenzollerns. For
that reason, with very sincere regret. 1
repudiate Representative Mann's leadership.
I shall support Representative
I-enroot of Wisconsin for Speaker when
the next Congress convenes."
House politics will hum when the
members get together again. The fight
which was talked of quietly in the
Moakrooms will now probably come out
into the open and a merry war will ensue.
with the half 'Zozen independent
and radical members considerably
heartened oy trie suaaen anruiunvemciu
of a veteran of the fight against the f
cannon rules system. Representative .
Gardner was a member of the insurrec- '
tion party in that famous revolution. j
P Mr. Mann's Record.
Representative Mann has won his way 1
almost to the speakership by sheer grit ;
and merit. In doing so he has made enemies,
as any forceful man will do in a
career as minority leader. He has done i
wonders in the way of bringing the two
wings of the republican party together,
but has not succeeded in winning the <
absolute support of certain lukewarm
republicans, most of whom are from
the west and northwest.
Representative Lenroot, one of the
quietest men in Congress, has also won 1
friends and enemies, and just at present 1
some of the more radical men in the
House, particularly those of socialistic
tendencies, look upon him as leaning :
toward the Mann side of the party. Here- '
in lies a peculiar situation. Regulars
would support Mann without a murmur
for his ability and party actions; progressive
republicans would support Mann 1
if the regulars would promise a program
of progressive legislation. Hut there are
a few men. probably not more than half
a dozen, who have given indications lately
of turning against Mann and forcing a
republican alignment behind some one of
their number.
Had Previous Opportunities.
A few weeks ago there was a feeling
that the republicans might have to nominate
Renroot for Speaker i ri order to get
behind the republican strength in the next
House the entire republican membership.
' There would be at the highest only two
or three majority for the republicans, and
^ a defection of radicals would split the
party so that the democrats would or*
ganize the House even with a minority.
I.enroot has- had previous opportunities
to run as candidate for Speaker and turned
them down for the sake of harmony.
These things were talked over by a score
f progressive republicans a year ago.
and their policy foliowing the conference
was to stick to the regular organization
arid demand progressive legislation.
Now the-e comes a little group of
four or live radicals, including Randall
of California, a prohibitionist: I.ondon
of New York, a socialist, and Martin
of I-ouisiar.a. ?ai!ing himself a bights
rif protectionist-progressive. who
de they can swing the balance of
Dover And on top of flat comes
?:..rdrsr, who declares lie will r.ot vote
for Representative Mann, and v. ho may
sp'it the republican party so as to insure
the democratic organization of the
1 louse,
looks Like Open War.
The situation looks like open war in
the republican ranks, but. of course, it
nay be maneuvered into a situation
where the differences will be settled
Quietly and without fireworks. Anyone
who counts on Representative
k Gardner to be quiet. however, is likely
I t<> be disappointed, lie has ortc of the
^ * most commanding voices in Congress, |
and uses it on any occasion he feels J
constrained, and no one yet has been
nble to still nini. He used it Iri the
rules fight, lie used it in the fight for
a larger navy. )]# is bound to be heard
and his Cincinnati announcement foreshadows
a runing fight from now until
the House adjourns sine die.
The regular organization has let it
be known if. will meet the progressive
element half way. The progressives demand
a program along their line of
thought. They will not countenance,
they say. the high tariff views of Representative
Kordney of Michigan, who
is now top man on the republican side
of the ways and means committee.
Baises Entirely New Issue.
Some of the most radical want a further
revision of the rules, with open
committee meetings, votes in committee
of the whole, etc., but older heads
adv! them to relinquish that fight, in,
nsmuch as the House rules are looked
upon now as fairly good from a pracliI
en I standpoint. Things were being ad- j
I justed between these uo elements

NAMES MEN TO i !
INAUGURAL HONORS
Chairman Harper Aiso Appoints
Members of Five
Other Committees.
TO FEATURE PREPAREDNESS j
Important inaugural committees announced
by Robert N. Harper, the inaugural
chairman, last night, are those on
reception, legislation, street decorations,
illumination, hotel accommodations and
auditing. The reception committee is one
of especial honor and the personnel was
most carefully selected by Chairman
Harper and Committee Chairman Charles
A. Douglas because the members of this
committee are to greet and extend social
courtesies to all the most distinguished
persons in the official, political,
business, professional, educational and
social life of the nation.
The legislative committee also Is one
of great importance and exacting in its
requirements, since the members make all
the dealings through Congress requisite
for the big inaugural celebration. Choice
legal talent was especially desired in the |
make-up of this committee.
With his committee assignments
practically cleaned up. Chairman Harper
faces a busy week in starting the
detailed work of arranging for all
features of the inaugural program and
the entertainment of the entire United
States at the second induction into office
of President Wilson.
Invitations to Governors.
Personal letters to the forty-eight
governors of the states will be Mr.
Harper's first concern. He wishes to
arrange as soon as possible for the
participation of all the governors and
their staffs. He wishes also to get
authoritative and detailed information
from them regarding the number of
state militia that will be available for
the inaugural parade apd what conditions
must be fulfilled to perfect arrangements
for their participation.
From the governors also he wishes to
get definite information regarding the
enrollment in all the schools In the
country where military training- j
given under an officer detailed by the
War Department.
Chairman Harper is particularly desirous
of having the inaugural parade
illustrate the "preparedness" of the
United States. He oeljeves that this
can well be shown by the parade of
young men from the military schools
and that it will at the same time teach
them lessons of patriotism. He is already
in touch with 180 of these institutions.
Several of the inaugural committees,
have established headquarters and set
to work in real earnest yesterday. Following
a conference between Chairman
Harper with Maj. Gen. Tasker H. Bliss,
chief aid to Maj. Gen Hngh L*. Scott,
grand marshal of the inaugural parade,
and Maj. Gen. Carroll H. Devol, U. S. A.,
retired, designated as adjutant general
of the inaugural parade, it was officially
announced that Gen. Devol has established
headquarters in the War De- (
partment and will from now on give
a</tive attention to parade plans.
To Get Information About Troops.
His first care will be to see just what
troops will be available for the parade
March o. He will also take up in an 1
official capacity with the Navy Department
what naval vessels can be here
for that occasion so that the jackies <
may parade and for the participation
of Naval Academy students. The rnili- .
tary end of the parade plans will be j
pushed vigorously from now on.
Chairman Harper has taken up the
question of making the parade ac
!, ? Cp^nfl \r-?nv u ? f-aa\r it <=
possible. He noticed that four years
ago the parade from the Capitol to ihf
White House was very irksome for
the men. arid realized that with four more
years added to their infirmities the
strain this time would be even more
taxing. He has recommended that the !
Grand Army be allowed to march only!
part of the distance, so that it may
pass tlie reviewing stand or that conveyances
be provided for the men.
Frank K. Cord, chairman of tiie press
committee, has opened headquarters in
the District National Hank Building
and is planning to start his nation-wide
publicity work to acquaint the people
of the country with information regarding
the plans for the inaugural that
will be of particular interest to them.
No Obstacles to Suffragists. f
While women will be allowed to participate
to their hearts' content In the
inaugural parade, the inaugural committee
will put no obstruction In the
way of the proposed suffrage pageant
and demonstration March 8. This will
be arranged to visualize the demand of
the women of the country for the passage
by Congress of the Susan B. Anthony
amendment to enfranchise women.
and the voting women of the west (
are to participate by the thousands.
While the suffrage demonstration
has been started by the Congressional
Union for Woman's Suffrage, plans are
being worked out whereby all shades
of suffrage organizations wili participate.
so that the pageant would be
in reality a big united suffrage demonstration.
It is pointed out bv the suffrage
leaders that both factions of
suffrage workers have united on working
for the passage of the suffrage
amendment, and that by uniting in
this pageant here on March 3 they will
emphasize in the strongest possible
manner their united demand for the
enfranchisement of women. A permit
for the psjrade has been granted by
Maj. Raymond W. Pullman on the one
condition that it will not conflict in
any way with the plans of. the in
augural cununnax.

ONE GREAT BRIT]
, VIEWS WILSOI
Manchester Guardian
Not to Flout Pre
Effort to I
By th?* Associated Press. ^
LONDON, December 23.?Analyzing the t
critcisms of President Wilson's note to
the belligerent nations, the Manchester
Guardian in a remarkable editorial, a
column long, which is unique because it
endeavors to interpret the President's r]
viewpoint, sounds a word of caution to- a
day against hasty and ill-considered ac- v
tion in making a reply. j a
The Guardian believes that the note, "if v
coolly considered and wisely answered, can ; t
only help the allies' cause and throw into ^
stronger relief the moral weakness of the ,
German position." The newspaper em- r
phasizes a point which it says seems to t
have been forgotten in this country, that ^
the identical note was addressed to all
n
belligerents, and says that a careful reading
of the passage in which President
Wilson suggests that both sides are fight- 1
ing for the same end reveals that the r
President said that this is what the bel- v
ligercnts tell their own countrymen. Continuing.
the Manchester Guardian says: *
Same Language to All.
"Coming on top of Germany's sug- a
gestion of negotiations, the note ap- J1
pears to associate itself with the Ger- ,
man view, and the reference to meas- n
ures which the I'nited States may
have to take reads at first a little too L
like a suggestion of menace. However, }.
it must be borne in mind that a note o
couched in similar if not identical
terms i3 being sent to all the bel- s
ligerents. For our part it will r
require the very strongest evidence
to persuade us that in the face of the v
great volume of sympathy for the al- c
lied cause which we are assured of t
on the other side of the Atlantic that
any act seriously prejudicial to our
cause can be contemplated at Wash- e
ington. c
"Another passage in the note which e
comes in for even more criticism also <s
acquires a different value so soon as a
we bethink ourselves that it is addressed
to both parties. This is the
passage which appears to suggest a
real identity *j? vic v> o a.* uci,?vv.. ?.?.c
belligerents. When the passage Is c
carefully read it is seen to say not
that the two belligerent parties have c
the same views or are fighting for s
the same ends, but that they profess n
to doing so when the governments
justify the war to their own countrymen.
This is a very different proposi- f
tion, and the passage as read by a
German of any humor might be taken v
as a very severe piece of sarcasm.'* t
Warns of German Game. r
The Manchester Guardian then sounds 1
a warning against the "allies being be- g
trayed into playing Germany's game, s
because if we put ourselves wrong a
with America we do play Germany's !,
game." The newspaper then adds this "r
advice: J
"Let us avoid imputing motives, take
the President's note at its face value ;
as a perfectly sincere document mean- j1
ing simply what it says. The President ,
believes the two belligerent alliances
to be less far apart than appears on
the surface. Washington probably has
means of Information that are not
fully available to us, arid if this view d
is taken at Washington it gives us a c
valuable hint as to the mind of Cer
many and conditions in Germany which
are wor king upon the minds of her i
rulers. f
"In any case, believing rightly or
wrongly, Germany would go further to
meet us than we suppose. Dr. Wilson ?
suggests that the two sides compare a
views. Again be it remembered that ^
this suggestion is addressed to both sides 0
and not to one alone.
"Now, the only views that we have *
from Germany are, first, that she con- *
siders herself victorious, and. secondly, a
that she invites us to negotiate. The
first position we deny. As to the second
we want to know something of the v
basis of the negotiations." c
The newspaper says when it is remembered
that Germany has made no *
definite proposal it roust also be borne *
in mind that. President Wilson does J J
net invite the allies to do anything

i
rermany already has done. and that
he note equally is an invitation for
lermany to do something she may not
ind easy. The newspaper then says::
Next Move With Germany.
"Clearly, the next move is with Gernanv,
and if Germany were to make
definite reply it would suffice to show
irhether the anticipations of the note
re well or ill founded. For example,
ire demand the integral restoration of
he territories Germany has invaded,
'his is definite and admits of an equaly
definite reply. If. and when, Germany
accepts we will in time take up
he other points. We do not know
whether the President imagines Gernanv
will accept it under the present
onditioris. hut at least he must admit
hat if she refuses there is not by any
neans that approximation of views
fhich he assumes, and in that case
he foundation of his case falls away.
"Neither lie nor American opinion can
dame us if we continue to fight for the
ndependence of Belgium and Serbia,
nd refuse to purchase it at the exlense
of any other ally. Again, we
hink reparation is due Belgium for
he spoliation of her cities, and even
nore now for the enslavement of -her
itizens. No American will question
h i s.
"In other words, we do not believe it
3 possible for Germany so to state her
iwn case in reply to the demands we
lave put forward as to commend it to
nv neutral nation like America with
trong democratic sympathies and liunane
feelings.
"This is the reason why we believe
hat the note if coolly considered and
visely answered can only help our
ause and throw into stronger relief
he moral weakness of the German portion.
"If, on the other hand, we resent
very suggestion of peace and are bent
?n seeing German mischief-making in
ivery mention of an end to the war we !
hall quite gratuitously be placing our-j
elves in an unenviable light."

Wilson's note to the belligerents

"Neither exaggerated optimism nor

The Zeit says: "It is to be hoped that

VIEW OF NEUTRALS I
ON GERMAN OFFER
Opinion Divided As to Whether
Allies Should Accept
Proposal.
WANT A PERMANENT PEACE
THE HAGUE. Netherlands. December
23, \ ia London.?Opinions of various
prominent men of Europe^as to
whether the peace proposals of the
central powers should be accepted or
rejected by the entente and their constructive
suggestions for a proposed
peace have been gathered by the bu
reau at. The Hague of the neutral conference
for continuous mediation, resulting
from Henry Ford's peace movement.
Among the answers received
are the following:
"Christian Hange of Christiania, secretary
of the interparliamentary union,
expressed the hope that the entente
powers would demand concrete proposals
from the Teutonic allies, but at
the same time be ready to state their
own fundamental conditions, after
which, he said, opportunities would
offer themselves to clear up the whole
situation.
Prof. Morgenstierne. rector of Christiania
University, expressed the fear
that the conditions and assumptions of
the belligerents were too conflicting to
hope for a speedy pacific settlement.
Starting Point for Peace.
Hjalmar Branting. the Swedish socialist
leader, said: "Germany, by contin|
uing the Belgian deportations, has
shown the unbroken power of her miliI
taristlc spirit. A demand for a full
definition of war aims must be put for|
ward by democratic parties on both
j sides as the starting point for a common
movement toward peace. The es|
tablishment of international order and
i of justice must be based upon the
I united power of all nations which undertake
to recognize such order. Competitive
armaments will then disappear
and military burdens will be considerably
lightened. Democratic control
must be established even in foreign
politics. The issues affecting
strongly intermingled nationalities will
be disposed of by extensive democratic
self-government."
The entente nations would be unwise
to decline unconditionally to consider
peace proposals, in the opinion of Dr.
Svente Arrhenius, president of the
Xobel Institute of Stockholm, who also
said that if they did decline they
should state their motive and define
J the modifications they deemed necessary.
He also appealed for the free de!
velopment of small nations,
j Admiral Landman, former premier of
j Sweden, appealed to the entente not to
| exclude the possibility of further con|
versations. ,

Would Reject Proposal.
"The proposal of the central powers
should nof be accepted." replied Baron
A. T. Adelswa^rd, formerly Swedish
minister of finance, "because it convevs
no clear idea of the principal
basis of peace. The central powers
start from the viewpoint that they
have been attacked, and that they have
established a decisive military superiority.
Neither of these points has been in any
way proved, and so the outlook is not
promising for a just and durable peace,
the object of which should be an international
organization of all civilized
nations."
Carl Landhagen, socialist mayor of
Stockholm, declared that impartial
judges must be uneasy with regard to
peacemaking as proposed by Germany.
The entente nations, he said, should
state their conditions.
I'ieter J. Troelstra, the Dutch socialist
leader, replied:
"The German proposal could hardly contain
anything other than the general
declaration of readiness to begin negotiations,
but the proposal should have included
a declaration of readiness, in the
spirit of Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg's
recent speech, to co-operate in the
establishment of an international associa|
tion to insure a durable peace, including
an agreement for the reduction of arniaJ
ment on land and sea. All the world
I knows that, notwithstanding its military
successes. Germany has a very good reason
to desire peace. It is precisely that
extremity which affords the best guarantee
that it will be possible to induce
the central powers to accept terms not
based on the present war map, but taking
into account the international interests
of the entente and the vital interests
of small states."
For Federation of States.
M. Troelstra then expounds his
theories of a federation of the European
states by free trade, the freedom of the
seas and also the free disposal of large
ports and international channels of
transport and the systematic organization
of export industries from which he
expects a durable peace.
The offer of the central powers should
not be rejected, thinks I?r. Theodorus
Heemskerk. former premier of the
Netherlands, as the crushing of an adversary
by either side is so improbable
as to mean the continuation of the war
for many years.
"None can say beforehand that the
proposals of the central powers are so
utterly unacceptable that even conversations
and eventually counter proposals
are impossible." says Dr. Heemskerk.
who concludes by emphasizing
the constant menace to neutrals of being
dragged into the war and laments
the fact that legitimate feelings of nationality
are being poisoned by international
hatred.

Information as to their exact
meaning in seeking a "just and
permanent peace" is the whole
purpose of the note addressed to
ail the belligerents hy President
Wilson. The United States desires
a full, practical and detailed
statement front each of the governments
addressed. This outline
and what follows, was stated
officially yesterday for the administration.
This government does not
know, ar?<l feels that it has had no
| real means of knowing, what
! terms would he required by each
'of the belligerents to make peace.
It regards the recent speeches of
the leading statesmen in all countries
as vague and undefined and
sees nothing in them that would
enable a conference to draw up a
treaty.
Their Meaning Obscure.
All speak of the rights of small nations.
the repugnance of conquest and
the guarantees of a permanent pcac*,'
but no one nation has yet gone into
what it means by those phrases in a
way that the government of the Initad
States can understand.
Recent press comment has been taken
to enhance that vagueness. France,
for instance, has not disclosed if what
she considers a just peace means tho
evacuation of her northern provinces;
or, in addition to that, the restoration
of Alsace-Lorraine; or if in addition
to both those claims she expects a
money indemnity for the damage of
invasion: or. beyond that, if she has
an actual program for doing away with
so-called German militarism. In short,
the United States asks what would aha
accept today as the basis of peace.
President Wants Details.
Similar issues apply to all the belligerent
countries in merely a var\inf
form. What President Wilson v. ants
is the details. As tlie largest neutral
facing grave problems and as the f.iend
of all parties concerned, the tinted
States feels most earnestly that it ia
entitled to know those facts. Irtiesa
some one of the groups lays down ita
actual terms there u ill be no basis for
negotiation and no possibility of peaca
till the world is bled white, officials declare.
There is not the slightest expectation
here that the terms laid down will be
reconcilable at first. Ii i: known that
some of the nations will demand what
in actuality is impossible. Nevertheless,
the naming of those terms will
afford a basis of negotiation, a starting
place from which fhe conflicting
interests can begin to converge.
Nor is any embarrassment seen to
any of the nations in naming such
terms. It is understood in advance
that they are apt to fluctuate with the
military changes and are not permanently
binding under new conditions.
Whatever any nation feels must be included
in its terms for moral reasons
can also he added to the terms without
embarrassment, it is said.
Ready to Join League.
As to permanent guarantees, it was
officially aeciarea umi hi? luhcu
States stands ready to enter any kind a
of international agreement that may *
seem most desirable to the nations,
whether permanent peace is to be secured
by force, if necessary, or by law.
The country is not committed to any
one plan and President Wilson is entirely
open to suggestions. It is the
administration view that the country
can be committed to an abandonment
of the policy of isolation, much as
President Monroe committed it to the
Monroe doctrine, without Senate action.
In the plans so far contemplated,
however, it is probable the nations
would be bound by treaty agreements
which would necessarily have to bs
ratified by the Senate/ so far as the
United States is concerned.
A fuller understanding of the embarrassment
caused to the administration
by the coincidence of its note with
the German proposals was given yesterday.
when it v.as said that, despite
the early unfavorable effect which the
note was expected to have in the allied
countries through that fact, it was decided
to risk it in view of the greater
interests involved. It is eijpected 1*
