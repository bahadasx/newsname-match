COCHISE CITIZEN
ARGUESFORTHE:
DEATH PENALTY ,
II
Mr Kdltor
In one. Issue last week was an edi
torial commenting on tbe abolition of
the death penalt in such a manner
as to cat reflections on its adlsabil
lt. Vou sa that about the time of
the law's publicit a murder was
committed in a bank robber and
shots fired at a strike at Ila. Now i of Yuma count ballots this afternoon,
these atrocities were committed b ! The librar room shift Is still at
Mexicans and I doubt whether they I work on Maricopa count The in
knew that such a lav. had passed Be-1 pected SOo ballots esterday after
sides, Mr. Editor, did ou eer hear i noon and an equal number this fore
of the like before the death penalty noon. No report was available as
wai abolished' The parties ou
mention did not start out to murder
or "shoot with homicidal intent." It
was a result of other intentions
The law is one of the best that has
eter been enacted in Arizona Why'
Because, there is to be no pardons
unless Innocence can be clearly prov
en. The new law operates Impartial
1 the wealthy and the poor and
friendless must paj the same penalty
Under the old law the wealthy and
Influential got the pardon and the
poor and friendless got the hangman's
rope.
If an innocent man is hung his
blood Is clearly Sipoif the ha'nds of the
Jury- and Judge and by life Imprison
ment there is no blood shed "Thou
shall not kill," was written on the
tablets of stone by the finger of God
and It has no "ifs" or "ands" no ex
ceptions either judicial or otherwise.
How does the new law accord with
your Bible m Christian friend? Let
us see.
Your Bible records a murder when
Cain killed Abel God acted as prose
cutor, sheriff. Jury and judge. Did
God pronounce death upon Cain? No,
he banished him sent him away from
mingling with his people Read
Genesis 4, 9-16 Cain complained that
people would kill him (Gen 4, 14)
Now the Ixird said, "Whosoever
slaeth Cain, vengeance shall be
taken on him sevenfold," and the
Lord set a mark on him to protect
him from being slain Does this look
like your Bible justifies hanging? Did
God know what he was about when
he gave us this example. This was
given by God himself, it Is not what
Moses or some other Bible character
did or said I will freely admit that
the new law Is not as merciful as the
old law. Imprisonment for life Is a
greater punishment than hanging.
The old law held out the hope of a
pardon. The new law- does not.
We are accosted by the saying, "An
eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth." Now hear what Christ says,
(Matt. 5: 38), "Ye have heard that it
hath been said. An eye for an eye and
a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto
yon. that ye resist not evil; but who
soever shall smite thee on one cheek,
turn to him the other also." How
then can a Christian advocate capital
punishment?
The practice of hanging Is a relic
of barbarism and is for vengeance.
Now the Lord says, "Vengeance Is
mine and I will repay, salth the
Lord." We must protect society and
by Imprisoning for life without the
possibility of pardon we have accom
plished this end without judicial mur
der. Think what a monstrous crime It Is
to hang an Innocent man. It has
been done and Is likely to occur

SAFE CRACKERS ARE AT
! WORK IN TEMPE;
PHOENIX, Dec 22 Safe crackers
were abroad In Tempe early this
morning, when attempts were made
on the safes in the McNary drug store
and tbe Jones cash store, both near
the business center of the town.
The burglars entered each place by
means of pass keys through the front
doors In both cases they knocked
the combination knob from the strong
boxes with a hammer, but at the drug
store were evidently frightened away
, before finishing the job.
At the Jones' store, however, the
safe was blown open by two charges
of explosive, which were heard by the
night operator at the telephone sta
tion, a short distance away, but to
which she failed to attach any signi
ficance Here the safe was wrecked and
$4 JO secured .

CLIFTON. I).-c 11 After a com
plete inspection of ail the ballots cast
at the recent election by the Inspec
tion board appointed by Judge F. B.
Lalne, it was found that when every
tote was gien to Cash and Slaughter
that could possibly be construed their
way Slaughter still has a lead of 19
voteB.
Last Frlda Arthur Slaughter filed
his answer to the Cash complaint In
a oluminous document consisting of
twenty typewritten pages but which
was simpl a specific denial of all the
allegations Judge Laine then In
structed each side to choose an In
spector F A Thompson was se
lected as Cash's representative and J.
C Gaines as Slaughter's The court
then appointed V W Beck as the
third member and the board met and
organized on Saturday but did not
start work until Monda.
The Inspection required two days
time in which the Doard examined
2487 ballots. 1T97 of which concerned
the sheriff's race The original totals
as certified by the election boards
gaie Slaughter a majority of 68 and
the new tqtal as found by the Inspec
tion board gives Slaughter a majority
of 19 after all doubtful totes have
been given to each candidate. Slaugh
ter's total is 90S and Cash's 889.

KILLED WHILE
ESCAPE
GLOBE. Dec 2! One man Is dead
and another Is probably fatally wound
ed as a result of an attempt on the
part 'of three com lets to escape from
the "bull pen" of the convict road
camp twent miles from Solomonvllle
on the Duncan highway last night.
Only meager report of the matter
could be obtained over the telephone
wires last night, but It was definitely
learned that Jesus Rodrlquez lost his
life and that another Mexican was
badly wounded by bullets fired at
them b road camp guards.
According to word received from
Safford, three of the prisoners at the
camp made a break for liberty. They
were detected b) tbe guards and a
large number of shots were fired.
Rodrlquez fell with a bullet through
his heart and one of his countrymen
was so badly wounded that It was be
lieved he could not survive.
BUCKSHOT KILLS CONVICT
SAFFORD. Dec. 23 About 1:30
o'clock this morning three Mexican
prisoners In the state prison camp
above Solomonvllle attempted to es
cape.. Just as they were climbing over the
fence the guards were aroused and
opened fire with shotguns loaded with
buckshot.
Two of the men fell and the third
ran to his tent, where he was found
by the guards unhurt.
When the guards reached the two
who had fallen one was dead and the
other seriously wounded.
Doctors were summoned from Saf
ford and they dressed the wounds of
the Mexican, who had been removed
to his tent. One shot struck him
back of the left ear and another shot
penetrated the left shoulder.
The dead Mexican was named Jesus
Rodrlquez. One buckshot entered his
back and penetrated the heart.
Jesus Rodrlquez was sent to the
penitentiary at Florence from Cochise
county on the 24th of last September,
having been sentenced to a term of
not more than three years for urglary.
For the balance of the week F. N.
Wolcott will keep open during the
evenings. All toys are going at and
