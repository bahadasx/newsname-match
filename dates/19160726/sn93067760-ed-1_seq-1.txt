the bigg'est mlarine sensations which
it has ieve'r rec"eived, when she init in

which the allies have set for lie, or
will she lind an anchorage in Diavy

whlih this ruost daring of undersea
rtnners has to evade the great nets
which have been set readly to snap
heri up and sillueeze her life out? Will
she ilake her (ermuan port, or has
tier nautl' gone down in history as
one full of daring and of adventure?
Naval experts in Washington helieve
that the escape Of the 3eiischlaild
will d(l'-nd upon several points. First,

inade with a lish honik attacinent,
and once ca:ttcting hold, there is no
way to loosen,1 thema except inl the sarnie
inanner" that at limh is detached trust
a line when caught.
'T'hus when the allies would land
the subinarine with one of their itnn
luoth nets there would he three ways
to dernilihi her. She iight hw
,strangled to death--tihi is, with a
good hold the net would si1uply let
the subtuarine stay where she is sub,

her crew would be suffoated for want
of air.
