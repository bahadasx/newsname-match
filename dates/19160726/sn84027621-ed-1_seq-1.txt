STRUGGLE WAS STUBBORN
London, July 25. The battle on the
Somme front, which began Saturday
at midnight and had continued since
with brief lulls, is still being fought
by British and Germans with the ut
most stubbornness. An indication of
the importance the Germans " attach
to defending their third line is found
in the report of General Haig, the
British commander, and in the Ger
man admission, that regiments" have
been brought from before Verdun in
order to lend all possible strength
to General Von Einem.
The British, if they are making but
slow progress, have been able to re
pulse all the fierce German counter
attacks and fully . maintain their
ground, although the fighting largely
consists of hand-to-hand conflicts.
HAVE REPULSED HINDENBURG
The Russians continue . their "suc
cessful drive in Southern Volhynia,
Petrograd reports. They have driven
the Teutons back near the Slonevka
river, which i3 a 'branch of the Styr,
which the Russians were crossing.
Teutoni closses were heavy. The Ger
mans under General Von Hindenburg
who attacked the Russians near Kam
mem, twenty miles west of Riga, were
compelled to retreat.
TOOK A TURKISH TOWN
The Russians have captured Erzin
gan, Petrograd announces.
OTTOMANS AID THEIR ALLIES
Turkish troops have been sent to
Galicia to aid the Teutons against the
Russians, says Berlin.
AUSTRIANS ADMIT RUSSIANS
ARE ROUNDING THEM UP
The Austria-Hungarian general
staff says the Russians took 100,000
prisoners in the present offensive in
stead of 200,000, as claimed by Petro
grad. It is declared that the total of
Austro-Hungarians in that sector are
less than the latter number.

GERMANS ADD TO ;
, BELGIUM'S DISTRESS
(Associated Press)
the Hague, July 26 Notwithstand
ing that she has already largely
monopolized the export of Holland's
surplus agricultural and other food
products, Germany has just taken
measures with a view to removing
Belgian buying competition from the
Dutch market. A decree has been is
sued in Belgium prohibiting com
munes and dealers from importing
goods from Holland. Applications to
make such purchases must be submit
ted to Berlin. The result is that Bel
gium, where distress must be submit
ted to Berlin, is deprived of an indls
pensable supply of goods, and the
great difficulties which the American
Relief Commission is experiencing
with cargo space does not allow of
the adequate and speedy replacement
from that quarter.

Alderman Tompkins Says the En
gineers Do Not Stay On .
the Job ' '"
Another movement is on foot to stir
up matters in connection with the
new combined light and water plant.
Councilman D. W. Tompkins said this
morning that he was preparing to
have the city's engineers, Twombly &
Henney, removed. Mr. Tompkins askT
ed a representative of the Star why
attention was not called to the engi
neers not remaining constantly in
charge cf tin c instruction of the new
plant. He said that': engineers were
constantly in charge of the sewerage
work, and thorght the work on the
water works and ; electric light plant
cf even greater importance. The
councilman sa'd that Engineer Hen
ney was runn'ng back and forth be
tween here and New York, and lie
pointed to Mr. Henney's having left
here Monday for that city. He said
that the engineers did not fail to make
sure of getting their money.
"The matter ought to be aired,"
said Mr. Tompkins, "because I am
getting ready to nave them ousted."
Mr. Hennery left Monday for New
York City, saying that he would be
gone about two weeks. It was said at
city hall this morning that before Mr.
Henney left he received a check for
1997.50, one half of the amount due
his firm for the preparation of the
plans and. specifications of the new
plant.
Robert Ebneriias.been Jeft by Mr.
Henney in charge of inspecting the
construction of the , plant, and it is
said that Mr. Ebner is not an engi
neer. ' .
An examination of the contract be
tween the city and Twombly & Hen
ney does not disclose anything spe
cially requiring the engineers to re
main constantly on the work. The
contract says that the enginers must
supervise the construction of said
water works , plant and system and
electric light and power plant and sys
tem, as the work of construction pro
gresses, including' the engineering in
spection of ; materials ' and work done,
used and furnished in the construc
tion of the aforesaid water works
plant and system and electric . light
and power plant and system, and that
they the said Twombly & Henney, will
furnish the grades and levels for the
said construction, and will keep re
cords of the work and construction
completed."
Mayor Robertson said this afternoon
that he had requested President Nash
of the council to have the work on the
plant stopped until an engineer ; be
placed in charge. The mayor said
that he had no authority to stop the
work himself. He said that it would
be a matter for the council.
Mr. Ebner, when seen this after
noon, seemed very much surprised at
the storm that had broken around
him. He said that he had been to see
the mayor, and had explained ; the
matter, he said, to the mayor's satis
faction. Mr. Ebner said that Mr.
Henney had left him to inspect the
mixing of concrete and the laying of
bricks. Some clerical work for the
engineer is also being done by Mr. Eb-.
ner. -
President Nash, when asked if work
would be stopped, or whether a meet
ing of council would be called to dis
cuss the situation, said that it 'would
not he necessary to stop work and not
necessary to call a meeting of council.

Lack of Footgear Prevents Teutons
and Bulgars from Attack-
: 7 ing Saloniki
(Associated Press)
Berne, Switzerland, July 26. Ac
cording to reports here, the Bulgar
ians and Germans have about a half
million men ready for an attack upon
Saloniki; The greatest ; difficulty the
Bulgarians have had to contend with
is the lack of shoes. A Swiss doctor
just returned from Sofia says that
fully half the Bulgarian forces are
without shoes, which civilians also
find with difficulty at piices running
from eight dollars a pair upward.
Bulgaria; without shoe factories and
tanneries, is. also short of hides. The
entire stock on hand has been dis
tributed among the troops. The sol
diers are cutting them up themselves
and make a crude kind of sandal such
as served as footwear for 300,000 Bul
garian, Serbian and Turkish soldiers
during the Balkan wars.
Tourist and military boots sell for
$28 to $30 a pair when they are to be
had. The' government has advertised
for leather, offering four dollars a
pound, without avail. ...

morning with "the First Battalion in

about one-third going through, shoot
ing at 200, 300 and 500 yards, slow
and rapid, fire. . The' men holding

the arm sore.

my earnest desire to take my place in
the trenches and to deal such blows
at our enemies as my age and
strength would permit.
. "But the inscrutable Almighty has
willed otherwise. Into my care has
been committed by Divine destiny the
leadership of our country, its armies
and its forces on land and sea.
. "The burden of thinking, deciding
and leading has been hard upon me
and realizing this I know that my life
must not be risked in the foremost
line of battle where my feelings, if
unrestrained, would carry me swiftly.
"My life must be conserved careful
ly for the welfare" of Germany, in or
