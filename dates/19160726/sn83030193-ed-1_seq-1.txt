front, wai followed by an admission by Derlln that the
British had cstabUshed themselves there "after a suMmc
fight." For three daya there had been a determined strufgla)
in the streets of the town. Each building had to be taken
separately. The victory was won for the British by Colonial
troops from Australia and New Zealand.
Berlin reported repulse of the allies in Foureaux Wood
near Longucvnl, and in Trones Wood, on the Somme front
and a small advance against the French on Hill 304, on the
Verdun front.
Russia officially announced the capture from the Turks
of the strongly fortified town of Erzingan, in Armenia, and '
the retreat of the enemy toward Slvas, 130 miles to the west.
Erzingan wns the most important base in Asia Minor.
Petrograd also claims that the Russian drive in southern
Volhynia is progressing and that the Teutonic forces have
been pressed back near the Sloncvka River. The capture
of 4,000 men nnd 63 officers is claimed.
An admission is made in Petrograd despatches that
the Russian forces on the Riga front barely escaped defeat
by Von llindenburg's army, which "nearly succeeded In
penetrating the Russian front line, but was finally com
pelled to retreat." Berlin says ndvunced Russian positions'
were destroyed.
Berlin reports that Russian attacks on the southern
line were repulsed with severe losses. It Is cldmed that
Pr.'nee Leopold defeuted divisions totaling 60,000 men.
Rome claims that efforts of the Russians to recapture
Monte Cimone were defeated.
