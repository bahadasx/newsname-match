TEXAS TATE PRONOUNCED
. RISING YOUNG FIGHTER
Both Men Fouled But the Fifth Lost
Young Aspirant the Decision ; Tate
Delivered Smashing Blow With
Right and Held Up Well Under
Flynn's Short Jabs
By Chester Westfall.
Referee, Charles J. Brill: It Is unfortunate that ; the men
could not go the full ten rounds. Flynn himself committed the
first foul, In the Initial period. It was plainly unintentional and trom
the manner !i which Tate entered Into the fight immediately,
it was evident that it did no damage. It was such a foul as
may occur In any fight. Tate committed a total of five fouls
before I disqualified him, and then after I had warned him
three time. ' He slipped one blow through in the breakaway
and I cautioned him abcut It, he struck low and t cautioned
him again, he repeated the offense and I repeated the warn
ing. When he struck two more blows in succession below the
belt, there was nothing left to do but to disqualify him.
"We had given our words to everybody Interested that the
affair would be a clean boxing match, . conducted strictly ac
cording to the rules of the game. Repeated failure to heed the
warnings of the referee, even though -the failure were purely
unintentional, could result in but one thing, disqualification. A
clean game demands it."
Texas Tate: Charles Brill was the referee. His decision
stands. I havsn't anything to sfty.
Jim Flynn: Tate Is a clever youngster. Mighty clever. Just
a little more experience In the fine points will make him a for
midable opponent lor any fighter.
Patsy Corrlgan, chief trainer for Jess Willard: Tate's
failure was due entirely to the fact that he did not keep his
head. He had more than sufficient warning from the referee.
He Is a mighty promising man. I was rather expecting htm to
win over Flynn after seeing the first two rounds.
Why Tate Lost.
It was the excitement of his first
big bout that lost the decision for Tex
as Tate over Jim Flyum the Pueblo
fireman-fighter, at the hall park last I
night. That and Flyhu's superior
knowledge of the fighting game in all
its thousand aild one angles.
Tate exhibited a terrific,' smashing
Mow, such as Flynn never did .show
if ho possessed. The difference be
tween the two fighters waBMn temper
ament, rather than ability, flynn. en
tered the ring as coolly as a grocery-
man steps behind his counter of a
morning. It was all in' the day's work'
to him. His sixteen years within the
ropes made one fight more or less of
not terrific importance.
Tate Excited.
The local man was visibly exriled.
He was -confident, too, ready and anx
ious for the fight to begin. It meant
a lot to a rising young fighter his
first big bout. And it seems to have
been this super-enthusiasm that lost
the decison for him in the third round
when Flynn was awarded the honors
on a foul, striking low.
Crowd Cheers Tate.
Tate was met with a great cheer
from the several hundred fans present
when he walked into the ring at ten
minutes of ten. He didn't need any
introduction. Doctor Richardson
spoke of him as "The pride of Chicka
sha" when he raised his hand.
Flynn also got a cheer as he was
presented as the fighting fireman
from Pueblo. .
it wasn't a cheer of encouragement,
however, the heavy set veteran iHdn't
appear to have a chance before the
local young giant. Everybody cheered
because they felt confident that the
ex-railroader would put up a classy
exhibition for the ring-sider.
Celebrities Introduced.
Jack Ourley was introduced to the
crowd while gloves were being fitted,
as the greatest promoter in the world,
the man with the record for stagm?
championship bouts. He was the man
who managed the Willard-Johnson af-j
fair. Nate Jackson, lightweight of Ok
lahoma Cljty, had already been intro
duced to the crowd, mqstof whom
were familiar with his features, either
from seeing him fight, or from seeing
his picture in the sport sections. They
were almost as well acquainted with
Sammy Samson, perhaps the best
known promoter in this section.
Right Off the Reel.
There wasn't any dilly-dallying when
Referee Brill raised his right hand
and the gong sounded for Ohickasha's
first big battle to begin. The men
met in the middle of the ring, which
was made light as day by the use of
heavy tungstens. They exchanged
Jjlows and clenched. Flynn got a
punch in the chin from Tate's power
ful right. Tate became acquainted for
the first time In his life with that fa
mous short body punch of Flynn's.
With little more than half of the
first .three-minute round over, Tate
went to the floor, admitted to have
been hit low., He took a count of five
and jumped up fighting. The round
ended with Brill kept busy prying the
two- men loose 'from clinches. The
fall that Tate took made It look like
Flynn's round,
Second Round.
Exchange of blows and clinches al
ternated in the second period. Tate
didn't back up a bit. He even did a
little more than his share of the forc
ing, considering the man he was up
against. He usually caught his oppo
nent's short jabs before they could
reach their mark. The fireman's abil
ity to catch blows on h's glove and
aim was needed to stop the locan man's
straight-out punch.
Tate is Warned.
Two warnings came from Brill io
Tate during this round. One was for
getting a blow by in the break, a blow,
by the way, that got the referee a
glancing crack, and one for striking
too iow. Many supporters of the local
man maintain that Flynn was system
atically using his Ik, J when the ref
eree was in such a position that ho was
unable to 'detect him. The round end-

body Is hurt. But even under theso
circumstances If any one is injured
prosecutions will follow. This, will
