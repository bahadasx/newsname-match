London, July 26. After three days
of desperate band-to-hand fighting,

masonry, the Ansae soldiers 'of Creat
Britain's armies have finally taken
the whole of the village of Posieres.
"The whole of Posieres is now in

reported briefly today. "Westward
the territorials have further ad
vanced, capturing two strong trenches
and ft number ot prisoners, Includ

no change."
The war has seen no more desper

of the first great thrust of the British

EIGHTH VICTIM OF SAH FRAIiCISCQ -B0L1BPL0TJEAD
FROn INJURIES
6an Francisco, July 26. With the
police so close on the trail or the
men responsible for Baturday'a out
rage that they expect arrests within
86 hours, the desth list as the result
ot the dynamiting was raised to
eight today when Mrs. Kinsley Van
Loo died at the Adler sanitarium.
the bomb squad, detailed to work
exclusively-, on this esse, struck sev
eral "hot trails" today, leading Cap
tain Duncan Matheson, in charge,
making this statement. -
"We expect to have definite results
inside of 56 hours.' A gang of sus
pects ' Is being watched right here
In the city and arrests may come at
almost any time. I believe that when
we round up tnls bunch of men we
will have among their number the
man who placed the infernal ma
chine in Saturday's preparedness
parade crowd."
Nearly half of the. IS detectives
detailed to the bomb squad have dis
appeared mysteriously and It Is un
derstood that they are watohlng the
men under suspicion. The strongest
clue yet furnished was that brought
by Newton Potter, owner ot the
m.ui , t t-..i

,the dynamiters purchased from htm
.the container supposed to have held
the explosive which was used in the
bomb. Potter gave the police a min
ute description of the two men who
made the purchase. Potter was able
to glre the police the model from
which the container was made, and
this Is expected to prove of great
value in running down the dyna
miters. ' 1
The menj told Potter that they
wished to use the container for ex
perimentation. They were very par
ticular about the manner of welding
a circle of thin metal about half
Inch hole just above the cap at one
end of the casing.
San Francisco, July 86. An

that tbe police within two days would
have the person responsible for Sat

and steadily pushed them back, al

The rain of machine gun fire was
Incessant save when forces en both
sides swarmed Out from their bar
riers and with clubbed rifles and bay

tbe Germans had time to' make em

, Capture of the whole of Posieres

In ' the salient from Thiepvalto

that the territorials having ejected
the Tentons from the village at once
began a westward encircling move
ment, menacing the enemy contained

ment from this edge of the curve is
expected. -.-:;: ' r" '"
urday's dynamite outrage In jail
created a sensation her today.
' Chief White declined to go into
details or to divulge any of the In
formation now in the hands of the
special police bomb Squad on which
he based his statement, but both he
and Mayor Rolph, to whom he com
municated his plans, were optimistic
over the outlook. White declared
he feared the ' detectives would lose
their quarry if any hint ot their plans
leaked 'out.
Simultaneously, White announced
that the total reward for the appre
hension ot the dynamiter whose
bomb snuffed out seven lives had
been brought to 1 15,000 by an offer
of an additional 11,000 by a man
whose name he could not reveal.
Tbe success ot Captain Matheson,
head , of the bomb squad, in recon
structing what he believes is an ex
act model pt tbe internal machine
which worked such human havoc dur
ing the preparedness parade, is be
lieved to have furnished the needed
clew. Experts from the Pinole and
Hercules powder companies have ex
amined Matheson'a model and believe
It is an accurate reproduction. t .
Chtet White evidently has no faith
in theories voiced In some quarters
that the dynamiting may have been
the' result ot a conspiracy formed In
eastern cities. He said today that
he believed It was 'a local "job" and
that the man or men who perpetrated
It are etlll In this city.
It Is believed that the persons In
volved already are under close sur
veillance. Federal secret service men and
postal inspectors are still working
In an effort to run down the persons
who sent threatening letters to local
newspapers and individuals, but have
not yet obtained a definite clew.

Baltimore, July 26.' Captain Koe- .
nig and his crew had one besetting
tear today over the success ot the
return trip" of " their submarine
freighter Deutachland. This was the
possibility that allied patrols off the
Virginia capes would be sealous to,
capture the submarine and would
overstep the three-mile limit law.
Mysterious maneuvers of the allied
guard ships and the contraction of
their line furnished basis tor. their
fears. And while Koenig waited up- .
on the arrival of the sister ship
Bremen a British, tramp anchored '
across . the . path of the Dentschhrnd -'
was in position to report his move
ments immediately. . . .

SECOIIO VICTIM -OF
TRAGEDY OEAO
Boston, July 26. Dr. Wilfred E.
Harris died early today at the city
hospital without a word or hint to
the police which might throw more
light on Boston's tragedy ot the eter
nal triangle. For a week the osteo
path lingered unconscious from the
three bullets with which he wis shot
down by Dr. Eldridge D. At wood.
In the triangle the woman. Dr.
Celia Adams, died from poisoning,
believed to have been ' selt-
admlniBtered. It was her' death,
after a confession to her fiancee, Dr.
Atwood, that Harris had betrayed
her.'that precipitated the shooting.
Atwood will be arraigned today
and the charge against him changed
from felonious assault to first degree
murder. He indicated his defense
will be a mixture of the brainstorm
and unwritten law pleas. His ver
sion supported by discovery of a
rasor in his pocket when arrested
wss that he called at Harris' offices
merely with the intention of muti
lating the osteopath, but that he went,
temporarily mad. .
New York Thomas Mulhearn
took an involuntary joy ride on a
