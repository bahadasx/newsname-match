NUMBER 39
It's a Go The Railroad.
To satisfy the many interested in
securing the railroad to Columbia we
make the following statement: The
road will be builc. As heretofore stat
ed, the line of least resistance is most
likely to secure it and therefore nec
essary preparation to secure the right
of way is important The preliminary
surveys will be made in the near future
and as soon as practicable thereafter
the locating line, or final survey, will
be made aDd actual construction work
begun. The route first to present the
most favorable condition in the right
of way will unquestionably have a
strong lead over others and to be plain
and fair to all, we advise you to secure
every concession needed along the line
and through the section you desire
the road, or to know exactly what
they will cost and the amount of finan
cial aid that will be given on the line
to pay for same. The building and
operating a road in any country is no
trifle. It means too much for your
business and convenience and increase
in the value of your land and products
to permit it to miss you when it posi
bly could be secured at reasonable ef
f ort and expense
The time is short for action for the
parleys between the contraccing par
ties are practicably past and the work
will soon begin. Don't get it in your
mind that it is coming this way mere
ly because you believe it the best way,
butbecauseyou will secure therightsof
way and produce the evidence of good
faith, good will and merit. Tnen,
above all, don't think that it will
finally fail for that is not on the
bill of fare. As above stated, the road
will be built, not merely because we
want it, but because we put up the
inducements.

Excessive rains over this entire sec
tion, accompanied with heavy winds,
did considerable damage, but after all
we are wonderfully blessed with the
prospect of the best corn crop in the
history of the country. It never
looked better nor promised a larger
yield nb this season of the year, but
the crop is far from a certainty now.
Much more rain will be needed to
make it measure up to promises

Since the heavy rains the necessity
of putting in the culverts between
thecreehsand town ought to bring
immediate action At both places
the road was damaged by the water
passing over the road.

The Passing of a Good Citizen.
The death of Mr. Samuel A. Epper
son, which occurred very suddenly at
his home near White Oak Church, last
Saturday morning, will be regretted
by every person who knew him He
was about sixty-five years old, and one
of Adair's best citizens. About day
light he arose from his bed, telling his
wife that he was not feeling good.
Mrs. Epperson thought that he was
just slightly ill, and she went to the
cook room to prepare breakfast, and
when she returned he was dead. His
demise is a great loss to the commu
nity in which he lived, as he was a
most accommodating neighbor and
friend.
The News extends sympathy to the
bereaved wife and all other relatives.
For Sale.

no damage was done to the oarn save

The vital statistics show that there
were 158 btrths in Adair county dur

More than half the number of deaths
was caused from preventable diseases,

sanitary condition Follow the in

Close Escape For Pastor and
Wife.
Dr. J. R. Crawford, pastor of the
Pikeville Presbyterian Church, and
his wife had a narrow escape from
death while out driving last, Friday
afternoon. The Orawfords were driv
ing around the hill road just below
Island Creek. When passing a narrow
place in the road the buggy in which
they were riding was overturned and
its occupants were thrown out, and
they rolled 30 Or 40 feet down the
steep embankment The horse and
conveyance also went over the hill.
Their escape is a miracle, because if
either horse or buggy had lolled over
them the chances are both would have
been killed. But through the inter
vention of a miracle Dr. Crawford
and wife came through the accident
almost without a scratch, the buggy,
which was capsized, being upside down
on a tree stump and the horse, which
rolled to the lower side of a com field,
was only slightly injured.
This is said to be the same place
where Charles York and wife met
with a similar accident a few weeks
ago Pike County News.

PROUD OF HELM'S RECORD.
ED WALTON IN LANCASTER RECORD.
An Advertisement.
To the Editor:
I notice in your issue of the 13th,
instant an unsigned article, which it
is the natural presumption, you fa
ther, and in which the Hon. Harvey
Helm is charged with "deserting the
President" in several instances
From absolutely indisputable au
thority I gather the following, which
shows the error of your charge, and
which I trust you will, in your usual
fairness, give the prominent space in
your paper that was given the article
making the charges.
Mr Helm is charged with deserting
by failure to support the "great Bank
ing and Currency Act." On Septem
ber 16, 1913, Mr. Helm delivered a
speech In the House of Represent
atives, advocating this measure and
urging its passage, stating among oth
er things that it was an '"'nsurauce
against panic." The speech was
printed in the Congressional Record
of that date, pages 50034, and was
printed in, pamphlet form at his own
expense, and mailed to twenty thous
and people in this district, including
those who are now attempting to de
ceive the people by misrepresentations
of his record. What higher evidence
of support could a member of Con
gress give a measure than to advocate
its passage in an appeal to his col
leagues in its favor?
In the second place Mr. Helm is
charged with "deserting the Pres
ident" in the passage of the Immigra
tion Bill, a measure, which the writer
says was ' designed to exclude a great
many illiterates and undesirable for
eigners from making America a
Breeding place and Asylum for
crime", which bill the writer now
discovers Mr. Helm voted for, but
which the President vetoed. If the
bill possesses all tlie virtues the writer
ascribes to it, what crime was there in
supporting it, the President to the
contrary notwithstanding?
The charge of desertion on the An
ti Trust Bills is a labored and over
strained effort. Mr. Helm, before
leaving for Kentucky on the funeral
committee that accompanied Senator
Bradley's body,had voted for the rule
that made these bills party measures,
thereby lining up with the President.
His unavoidable detention in Ken
tucky at the time of their formal pas
sage is the sole and only basis for the
charge of desertion, which to a fair
minded man must seem as erronious
as unfair There was a final vote on
these bills when the conference re
port was adopted in the House on
October 8th, 1914 Mr. Helm was
present and voted for report, as shown
by Congressional Record of that date.
On the fourth and last charge of
desertion, namely, the Panama Canal
Tolls Exemption Act, Mr. Helm voted
in accordance with the specific plank
in the Democratic platform adopted
at Baltimore, standing with Speaker
Clark, Majority Leader Underwood
and all the other House party leaders.
He explained his position on the floor
of the House in a speech delivered on
March 31, 1916, twentjr thousand copies I
or wnich ne sent to the voters of this
district, and thereafter was renomi
nated for Congress without opposition.
Out of a thousand or more record
votes Mr. Helm has cast, the four
above emune rated are the only ones
in a?hln t.ha mftfap rtnrfc nftts- ntTAn on I

justly proud. Borrowing an expres
sion from Baseball lingo, It is a bat
ting average of above a thousand,
which places him in a class above the
star performer Tyrus Cobb. I be
lieve that the fair minded readers of
the Central Record will agree with us
that even the lour instances do not
justify er substantiate the charge of
desertion, but, on the contrary, that I
there is something about the charges '
lhnt-.Giucrno-.Q t.ha rioal-.h mr.f.lA nf Mia
cause the said writer seems to be
championing.
Furthermore, if it be true that Mr
Helm was not, and is not an Adminis
tration Democrat, it is passing strange
that the press dispatches from Wash
ington to the Kentucky daily papers
have not disclosed the fact long before
