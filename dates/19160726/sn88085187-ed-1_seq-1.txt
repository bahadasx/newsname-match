Burns Men Appear In Strike Probe
CAR LINE EXTENSIONS
PLANNED FOR TACQMA
Abandonment of Steilacoom
Line Means Big Changes;
T. R. & P. to Tap Beach;
Town Turned Around.
Hig steps towards tlie upbuilding of Tncoma's tuburbs were
taken today wlien the old Steilacoom car line ceased operation,
after 25 years' contiimons service.
Dax island, Union's batch and Higgins' beach, OH the X ar
rows west of Tacoma, will be benefited more greatly than any
other locality, perhaps, because a street car line now will be tX-
Wtided from the present Lemon's beach station on the old Steil
acnoiii route down to the water's edge, tapping a community
of 1,000 residents.
Steilacoom will be entirely revised, because the nCw electric
line enters the tOWU by a new route, and will hair a terminus
several blocks from the old stopping place on Main street.
The Pacific avenue district in Tacoma will be built up, as
Manager Bean has promised to use rails of the old Stcilacoont
line to extend the Pacific avenue street cars from the present
terminus at $yd street, out to 46//) street.
Tlie Day island street car line will be an extension of about
one mile. It will run down liill to the water, and parallel the
Northern Pacific tracks to Titlow's beach, with a spur to the
'"X Snyder Rros. mill.
More than ioo pn>|>erty owners in the Day island vicinity
have announced their intention of building homes as soon as
the line is completed.
Steilacoom electric cars, which began running today be
tween Steilacoom and Steilacoom junction, on tlie Pacific
Traction line, where passengers will transfer to the big lake
cars, now enter the town two blocks up the hill from Main
street.
Tlie line will run west to Union avenue, and north to a point
within a block of the new Northern Pacific station.
All business houses in Steilacoom will I>e, moved to Union
avenue, several blocks from the present business center. Several
brick blocks have already been contracted for. The new line
means the rejuvenation of Stdlacootn, old settlers aver.
Although rails on the old Steilacoom line are small, they are
of high grade, and far more durable than present day rails,
selling at 10 times the price paid 25 years ago.
The old rails are in perfect condition. They will he torn up,
and used on the Day island and Pacific avenue extensions.
Work of tearing up the old line began early today, from the
Steilacoom end.
Tlie county commission will construct a boulevard along the
mute of the old line, using the railroad bridges and right-of
way. Since the grade is already established, the boulevard can
be built at a cost of $800 a mile, and v ill be one of the finest
highways radiating from the city of Tacoina. it is declared.
ll will be a direct route from the city, connecing with the
(.'enter street boulevard at Regents Park.

HISTORIC EVENT,
WINDUP OF OLD

By E. A. Peters
"Manager Bean once told me
that the only way he could get
rid oJ me was by abandoning the
Steilacoom line.
"He can't do it. He is taking
more than half of the line away
from me, but I'm going to hang
on to the rest as if it were a
long-lost In-other."

come to.another of the mile

Historic Event, in

The passing of the Steilacoom
line yesterday was a historic
event. Its significance is meas

me ride on the rear platform of
derelict car No. 551 for an entire
round trip, fie even let me break

bought me a cigar in Bair's drug

the return trip.
For "Purd" was celebrating.
He bought Ice cream cones for the
kiddles of Steilacoom, and shook
hands all around with the group
of old-timers that always is on
hand when the car with the aft
