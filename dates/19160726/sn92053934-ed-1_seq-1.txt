to begin. Noon, however, saw no lift
to the clouds, which hung low until
they joined hands with the fogs from
the Sc.: in me flats, and as there was no
prospect of witnessing anything inter
esting or important, the watch was
abandoned.
The weather was not too thick, how
ever, to prevent the general line of op
posing positions being traced from this
observation point. Almost at the ob
server's feet was the point of the
wedge w hich the Prenc h had driven
against Peronne.

Somme. which now again was in Ger
man hands, could not be seen, as the
town lies too low in the valley, but the
height of La Maisonette stood out
plainly. Its ownership now was
shared, the Germans holding the park,
while the chateau on the southern edge
remains in Krench hands.
Kven on this scene of inaction shells
and shrapnel were seen bursting fre
quently over La Maisonette.
From La Maisonette the line ran
generally southwest, to the village of
Belloy, the- corner bastion on which it
bends almost directly westward to
Soyeeourt, where it enters the original
front before the beginning of the of
fensive. I!arleau in German Hands.
An artillery observer stated that the
village of Barhaux, which the French
repeatedly had endeavored to storm,
was in German hands, while Bedloy
was a French stronghold and the vil
lage of Kstrees was divided in posses
sion. The French had this morning
twice attempted to push forward the
lines here by vicious attacks with
hand grenades and bayonets, but with
out success. Barleaux and La Maison
ette appeared to be the storm centers
in this sector. To the northwest the
square tower of Peronne cathedral
arose from the valley. The houses of
Peronne also were dise-ernible. Offi
cers who recently had visited the city
said Peronne was remarkably little
damaged in view of its proximity to
the battle front. All civilian inhabi
tants of Peronne have now evacuated
the city though greatly against their
wishes.

BUBBLE BURSTS
GIVING A CLEW
Death of Elizabeth Ratcliffe Without
Parallel, if Crime Actually Com
mitted, Say Physicians.
ARE BAFFLED FOR A TI3IE
Heart Almost Explodes When Fierccd
Instrnment Found Under Tree
IJrouaht to Attorney.
.
Olney. 111., July 20. When a tiny
bubble burst in an artery under pres
sure of a physician's knife, the first
chain of evidence against Roy Hinter
liter, who brought the body of Miss
Elizabeth Ratcliffe, who died while
buggy riding with him, to a sanitarium
here last Friday night, was said by
prosecuting authorities to have been
welded. The death of the Ratcliffe girl
is said by medical authorities to be
without parallel if it develops a crime
actually was committed.
Hinterliter was held to the grand
jury without bond yesterday by a cor
oner's jury, which held him respon
sible for the girl's death.
Hinterliter began calling on the girl
about ten months ago when she came
to Olney from Paoli, Ind., to live witn
her sister, Mrs. Bert Fancher. Last
Friday evening. the couple went buggy
riding. The girl is said to have died be
neath an old elm tree two miles from
town. Doctors say the girl was dead
when she was placed in the buggy for
the ride to the sanitarium.
"We were getting near town when
she said, 'Roy, I feel bad,'" Hinterliter
tedd the physicians. "Then she fell
over in my lap and I rubbed her hands
and feet, but couldn't bring her to."
Organs Stand examination.
At an autopsy no marks of violence
were found, but it developed that the
girl was soon to become a mother.
Careful examination failed to reveal
any attempt at an illegal operation.
The stomach was examined. No trace
of poison was found. Then one of the
examining doc tors stuck a probe into
an artery. There was a "pouf" almost
inaudible, as a bubble burst. It was
said only two things known to medical
science would cause embolism in the
arteries faulty injection with a hypo
dermic needle or a lesion of a lung.
The body was examined carefully.
There was no needle marks. There
was no lesion of the lungs. The brain
was found to be full of water. The
heart, when pierced, almost exploded.
Instrument is Found.
Thus matters stood when a man
from a neighboring town came to
State's Attorney Norris' office with a
package containing an instrument
used in performing illegal (operations.
He said he had found one of the boy
friends of Hinterliter picking it up un
der an old elm tree, a landmark of th:
viiinitv, had taken it away from him
and brought it to town thinking it,
might have some bearing on the case, j
Sheriff West visited the spot men
tioned. He- found whe re a horse ha 1 i
been ti'-d and marks of a struggle m
the sandy soil, the imprint of a girl's
hand and of a boy's shoes.
To a friend who saw Hinterliter af
ter he had taken the girl to the sani
tarium Friday night, the latter is quot
ed as saying :
"I am in had. Take my rig home
and tell mother ihat I don't know
when 1 will be home, but to expect
me'."

TO WASHINGTON
Americans on Black-List Appeal
Senate, House of Representa
tives and Governors.
to
New York, July 20. Copies of reso
lutions calling upon the United States
government to promptly bring about
the recall of commercial restrictions
placed upon American citizens by Great I
Britain were sent today to members of
the senate and house of representa
tives, and governors of all the states.
The resolutions were adopted by the
Association to Resist British Domina
tion of American commerce, composed
of 50 or more representatives of firms
ana individuals who nave teen piaceci)0f
on the British trade black-list.
Maurice M. Blumenthal, counsel for
the association, left for Washington
late last night carrying a copy of the
protest which he hopes to hand to
President Wilson today.
The preamble of the resolutions says
"that the measures adopted by Great
Britain are intended to compel Ameri
can domination regardless e;f conse
quences to American trade or rights." J
It declares the facts upon w hic h the i
black-listing was based were gained by;
"unlawful seizure, detention and ex
amination of American mails." Fear
is expressed that eventually Great
Britain may dominate the important
commercial activities of the American
people. It is also stated that it is
manifest that Great Britain's trade
ships cannot be accorded the hospi
tality of American ports or negotiate
commercial affairs with any Ameri
can citizen or firm on these shores "or
elsewhere" so long as other citizens
are restricted in their rights of trade.
' Washington. July 20. Ambassador
Page at London today advised the state
department of an informal discussion
he had at the British foreign office re
garding the British black-list of Amer
ican firms.
Department officials indicated that
the scope and effect of the black-list
order was gone over in detail at the
conference and t he ambassador learned
that the British authorities hold that
the order will not affect American in
terests so seriously as believed here.
The United States government, offi
cials stated, is not yet in a position
to p roc en d directly and formally fn
negotiations with Oreat Britain. Fur
ther visits will be made by Mr. Page
to the foreign office.
MOTORIST DRIVES

Morris, 111., July 20. Use of the
rural telephone last night made pos

London, July 20. Erzingan, the
strongly fortified Turkish town in cen

the Turks, says a dispatch from Petro

Recent Petrograd advices said that
the Russians, after beating off ener
getic Turkish counter attacks, were
converging on Erzingan from three
sicles and that the Russian advance
guards were within ten miles of the
fortified city. The Turks were report
ed by Russian aviators to be destroy
