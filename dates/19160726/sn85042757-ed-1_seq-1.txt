DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED
Clifford Oakes Accidentally Shoots Him
self While Huuting, Sunday.
Clifford Oakes aged 19, shot himself
ia the left thigh and side while out
bunving Sunday. Will Oyal was with
him and went for help to get the
wounded boy home.
It seems the Oakes buy was visiting
his brother-in-law, Major Swafford, at
Otter Creek, some fifteen miles north
of Crossville, and had gone hunting
with a double barrelled shot gun loaded
with No. 4 shot. In attempting to
shoot a squirrel or while moving around
seeking a position from which to shoot,
the gun slipped from his hand and was
discharged. The shot split his thigh
in front, four inches and then entered
his left side passing out making a ugly
hole. When the gun fired Oakes called
to the Uyal boy that he was shot.
When Uyal got there the Oakes boy
was trying to put out his clothing,
which had caught on fire. After ex
tinguishing the fire tfte Uyal boy went
for help and the boy was brought to
the home of his brother-in-law.
The boy was brought to town Mon
day and the wound was dressed by Ur.
W. A. Keed. So far as the doctor was
able to determine, none of the shot en
tered the abdomen. Unless unexpect
ed comp ications arise the boy will very
likely recover.
This is the second time the Oakes
boy has met with an accident by shoot
ing. Some years ago he shot his left
arm so badly that it had to be ampu
tated above the elbow, which in part
accounts for the accident this time as
he nad only one hand with which to
handle the gun.

September 28, 29, 30, Set a Time for
Holding the Cumberland
County Fair.
The fair committee met in the court
house Saturday, elected officers for the
ensuing year, set the date for the fair
and handled some preliminary matters.
Those present were Harry Martin, Jere
Morrow, K. K. Uunbar, E. G. Melvin
and S. C. Bishop.
Harry Martin was elected president
and financial agent, Jere Morrow, vice
president and S. C. Bishop, secretary.
The time set for holding the fair was
September 28. 29, 30, which will be
Thursday, Friday and Saturday follow
ing the state fair at Nashville.
It was very evident to the commutee
that some person would have to give
much personal attention to the detail
work of the fair and that no fair could
be held that would be of much assist
ance or importance to the county with
out such action. President Harry
Martin was engaged to take the matter
in hand and for the time actually en
gaged in the work he is to receive
$2.00 a day. Mr. Martin has been very
active in the two fairs that have been
held and to him more than any other
single individual belongs credit for the
success attained.
It was decided that President Harry
Martin be designated as chairman of
the several c mmittpes tor making up
its.
:ided that an admission
be charged to adults
children for admission
to the court fcuise ard, where the fair
will be held. Tf.e admission price
named will admh the .bearer ot the ad
mission ticket t. ...e fa'r for the three
days. The charge will be 25 and 15
cents whether the holder attends the
fair ail three days or only one day. It
is planned to hnve printed tags bearing
the name ot the purchaser of the ticket
and no person will be admitted on the
ticket of ancther person. In other
words, if you wish to enter the court
house yard or the high school building,
where the ladies' department exhibit
will he displayed, you must buy a tick
et and have your name written there
on. This was decided upon as being
the fa' rest way as it requires all who
attend the fair to contribute in a small
way to the expenses ot the fair. In
past years merchants and business men
over the county have contributed cash
to materially assist in meeting the ex
penses. Since the fair is tor the bene
fit of the whole people it is proper that
all contribute a small item toward
meeting the expenses. Any person
who is not willing to contribute the
small amount asked for admission is so
lacking in interest in the welfare of
the county as to not be worthy of con
sideration. The following persons were named
to assist President Martin in arranging
the premium lists :
LAUIES' DEPARTMENT.
Miss Fannie UeGolia. Mrs. J. B.
Johnson.
AGRICULTURE :
Jere Morrow, E. L. Lemert.
POULTRY :
O. B. Rector, Mrs. J. E. Taylor.
LIVE SIOCK:
R. R. Dunbar, Alva Potter, E. Gra
ham Melvin, S. J. Horn.
The commrttee adjourned to meet
again Saturday, August 12, tor com
pleting the remaining details and ac
cepting the premium lists.
The outlook for a good fair is ex
ceedingly bright as crops over the
county generally promise to be excel
lent. There will be a premium list
that will amount to a total of close to
$300 and the purpose seems to be to
make premiums some smaller than last
year and give more of them to the end
that more pe.sons will have a chance
to win prizes and thus encourage more
enfies. The basis of entries will be
decided upon at the next meeting ot
the committee.
INGRAM FOR SENATE
T. F. Ingram, of Roane county, was
nominated for the senate from the
Seventh district, at Athens, Saturday,
by acclamation. Mr. Ingram is now
senator from his district and his re
nomination by acclamations is a mark
ed distinction.
Work Being Pushed and Prospects good
for Many Miles of Road.
Sunday the editor of the Chronicle
made a trip over the road north of
town to see what had been accomplish
ed and we were much gratified to see
the splendid progress that had been
made and to learn how cheaply good
roads are being built.
Jas. Smith commenced work four
weeks ago with a small force of men
and teams, which force he has been in
creasing until he now has 80 men and
30 teams. In spite ot the fact that the
excessive ruin of the past four weeks
has prevented, him from getting in
more than three or four days a week,
he has nearly five miles of road tar
more than half completed.
The work started near the residence
of Mr. Smith and runs to the Greens
Ford steel bridge built by the county
a few months ago, and is to be pushed
north to the Fentress county line pass
ing near or or-through Isoline.
Mr. Smith followed the line as es
tablished by the surveyor until he
reached the Greens Ford bridge at
which point he found the survey was
so entirely wrong and run in such a de
vious and meandering way that he dis
carded it entirely. From there he did
the surveying by methods of his own.
He now has over two miles of road
that is as straight,, as a gun barrel,
with excellent graaes. The line run
by the surveyor was longer and not
nearly so good so far as grades ;?o be
sides it ran through farms in such a
way as to present great difficulties in
securing right-of-way. J
No uart ot the road fcitirely com;
pleted but in some platYs is so nearly
completed that a few days work in
dressing up will make it an excellent
road. Mr. Smith haB had practical ex
perience in road builcing and is getting
results tnat are very gratifying He
feels confident that when completed
the road will cost lers than $1,000 a
mile including cost of bridges.
This road is what is known as the
Dixie Snort Route and will pass
through the county from north to
south. Fentress county is now work
ing on the road south trom Jamestown
to connect with us at Clear Creek,
where a bridge will have to be built.
Under the act through which $200,
000 of road bonds was sold $125,000,
was designated to be used on th Dixie
Short Route. It now seems certain
that the grade will be completed for
the entire 32 miles for less than that
many thousand dollars. For a while
the idea prevailed that the Dixie Short
Route ought to be macadamized with
limestone, but that idea has been dis
missed by many persons in favor ot the
dirt roads because of the limited traffic
that the roads will be called upon to
bear. If an act should be gotten
through the legislature at its next sit
ting permitting the Road Commission
to use the money that will be left after
the Dixie Short Koute is graded tor
building other graded loads over the
county, no one would be surprised for
macadamizing roads in this county is
so expensive that the money will bring
better results for the people as a whole
if spent in building dirt graded roads.
The road as now being built passes
through the lands of Kent Jarvis, con
sisting of 1,500 acres, nearly every acre
of which lays beautifully for farms.
It is likely Mr. Jarvis, who lives in St.
Louis, will have the land platted for
farms and put it on the market. The
Everhard estate, Massilon. Ohio, has
done that with a large tract layirg
near town and several farms have been
sold and are now being rapidly devel
oped. ON THE MEMPH1S TO-BRISIOL.
C. E. Bell is workina several men
and teams east of Crab Orchard, in
Renfro Hollow, on the eastern end of
the Memphis-to-Bristol Highway.
They have so changed the Renfro Creek
that the road follows the creek bed a
portion of the way and the creek will
only have to be crossed once instead of
three times as by the old road.
A wagon show came along last week,
showed at Crab Orchard and then dis
banded and put their teams and men
to work on the highway. About tour-
teen miles of road remains to be com
pleted to connect up with the Dixie
Highway, at Rockwood. About five
or six miles remains to be completed
on the west end of the Memphis-to-Bristol
highway so autos can go to
Nashville via Sparta. That work will
be taken up later and pushed to com
pletion. For some time there was much com
plaint at the slow progress being made
by the Highway Commission in road
building but since the people are get
ting a better nderstandmg of the situ
ation and see what excellent results
are coming through the careful man
agement of the commission, many ex
pressions of praise are being heard
where it was complaints before. The
integrity and honesty of purpose of the
commissioners have never been ques
tioned and the wisdom ot their course
in moving slowly and with caution is
now becoming more strongly apparent
daily and as a result the temper of the
public is rapidly changing te one of
praise.
OLD CITIZEN 60NE
SENATOR WILSON BEREAVED.
Wife Passes Away of Cancer After Lin
gering Illness; Buried in Grassy
Cove.
Friday morning at 2 o'clock Mrs.
Wilson, wife of Senator T. E. Wilson,

after an illness of a year and a halt
with cancer.
The remains were interred in Grassy
Cove Saturday about noon attended uy
a large concourse of relatives and
friends.
Mrs. Wilson had been a long and pa
tient sufferer end when at iaat thai
death angel bore away her kindly spirit
it was an act of mercy for she had
suffered greatly for eighteen months
with the dread disease of cancer from
which she had no hope of recovery.
She was mairied to Senator Wilson
in 1883 and to their union several child
ren had been born, all of whom are now

John Hodge Dies Near Westel and Re
mains Intered by Masons.
John Hodge, aged 81, died at his
home near Westel, Wednesday at 2
o'clock p. m. and the remains were
laid to rest near Westel Friday morn
ing with Masonic honors.
The deceased was born Feb. 24, 1835,
and died July 19, 1916, which would
make him a little over 81 years of age.
His wife had preceeded him to the
grave and all ot his children are in
homes of their own. He was justice of
the peace from the old tenth district
for several years and was universally
recognized as a man of high character,
a good citizen and was held in high
esteem by all his neighbors. A short
time'previous to his death he went te
the Soloiers' Home, Johnson City, and
when he was stricken with his last
sickness, which was mainly failure due
to age, his son brought him home after
it became evident that he had only a
short time to live.
The deceased was a member of Cross
ville Masonic lodge and dearly loved
the principles of that order ano con
formed his life very closely to its
teachings. The writer had been per
sonally acquainted with him tor sever
al years and we know of no higher
compliment that could be paid him than
to say he loved Masonry in all its sim
plicity and purity. He had repeatedly
expressed the wuh that when he died
thfi Masonic fraternity should convey
his remains to their last resting place,

GOOD FOR UTAH.

state.
LEG BROKEN
Motor Car Leaves Track With Four Men
and All Are Hurt Some.
Sunday frazier Jones met with the
serious accident of having Ma left leg
broken near the ankle, both bones be
ing broken. He was brought to town
in an automobile and Dr. V. L Lewis
dressed the wound and the man return
ed to his home at Peavine.
The accident occurred on the Cum
berland North-Eastern railway, a lum
ber road that runs from Dorton to the
Cumberland Lumber Company camps
near Pea ine. Mr. Jones and three
other men had started on a motor car
from the lumber camps to tne railroad
engine belonging to the lumber com
pany and which had been disabled the
day before a few miles from the camps.
The motof car he was riding left the
track and bruised up all who were on
it and broke the leg of Mr. Jones.
None of the other men were seriously
hurt.
Mr. Jones is a poor m?n, has a wife
and four children and can not well
afford to lose the time that he will be
i laid up from the broken leg. Indica
tions are that he will recover rapidly
as he is a man ot about 35 years of
age. 1
WHAT A CALF COSTS
Shown by Experiments in Several Sec
tions of the Country.
Experiments have been carried on
in the corn belt, Pennsylvania, and in
Alabama, to determine what it costs
to raise a calf to weaning time.
Every possible charge was made
against the cattle, including not only
all feed but also labor, equipment,
taxes, risk, depreciation, veterinary
fees and interest at six per cent on the
investment, and against each calf was
charged not only the net cost of keep
ing the cow but also the cost of the
bull per calt. The final results are all
in favor ot the south.
AVERAGE COST.
The average cost per hundred pounds
of laising a calf to weaning time was
$9.10 in the corn belt and $7.22 in
Pennsylvania, as compared with $3.53
in North Alabama and $3.57 in West
Alabama.
The average cost per hundred pounds
of raising a calf to twelve to Mfteen
months old was $11.79 in the corn belt
and $7.24 in Pennsylvania, as com
pared with $4.41 in North Alabama
and $4.69 in West Alaabma. The fig
ures for the corn belt, Pennsylvania
and North Alabama are based on rais
ing a ca'f to the age of twelve months
and those for West Alabama to the age
of fifteen months.
Considering the low price of land,
the free range and the splendid crops
that can be produced here along with
the ease ot cultivation, it is very prob
able that cattle san be laised right
here in Cumberland founty for even
less money than hf experiments show
to be the lowest in Alabama. Certain
ly Alabama cannot produce beet cheap
er than this section and when it is re
membered that no where in the south,
west or any other part of the country
can land of equal quality be secured
for so low a price as here, it becomes
clear that this is one of the most fa
vored sections of the United States for
the cattle raiser.
