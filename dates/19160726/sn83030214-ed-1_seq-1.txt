Morgan and Astor Repn

Hearing.
The stAbilization plan of the Com
mission on Building Districts and Re
strictions, intended to preserve resi
dential and business neighborhoods in
New York and prevent such rapid tran
sitions as have hit Greenwich Village,
WaahiagtOfl Square and lower Fifth
Avenue, was adopted yesterday by thc
Board of F.stimate. The vote was taken
in executive session.
New York is no longer to run riot in
its development; it is to be restrained
and guided, as the ancient rivers of
the Teutons have been restrained and
guided by the Germans. Such historic
residential sections as have survived
the old order will be saved. The costly
homes around the Plaza need fear no
"Rooms to Let" signs for years to come.
Factories and othef business build
ings are to be built where other fac?
tories already cluster and in parts of
the city better suited to industry than
to homes. They cannot march through
a street of homes leaving dismal relics
of the past in their path and abandor.

when the original invaders are outlawed

' DwfltltBgS, churches, clubs. schools,
librarics and mureums have graciously
been granted their long forgotten due.
These, with BOtalfl, hospitals, sanatori
ums, railroad pass^nger stations and
even farms, are permitted in "residen?
tial sections" under the new ruling.
Reslrictions on Helght.
Buildings are to be regulated in
height by the width of the street. The
narrow canyons of the old days, Nassau
Street and the rest. will not be gouged
out of the n.-w New York. When a
part of their cliff wall crumhles it will
t,e replaced by a building constructed
in accordance with the new rules. Its
height will be gauged by the width of
the street and by t'ne height of sur
roundir.g build.ngs. Thus gradually
the Nassau canyons will dwindle.
The new plan was adopted by a vote
of 15 to 1, Commissioner Morrison, of
Richmond, acting f.-r Borough Presi?
dent Van Name, voting in the nega
tive on the entire proposition. Frank
L. DowllBg, President of the Board of
Aldeimen, vo'ed in favor of the whole
plan, with the exception of the block

EXTRA DIVIDEND
FOR U. S. STEEL
Part of Record Farnings
Applied to the Com

Wall Street ha. been bettlntr on the
result of the quarterly mceting of tho
Board of Pirertors of the Ualtad States
Steel Corporation When the mceting,
held at 71 Broadway, was over yester?
day afternoon and the fact became
known that net earnings for the quar?
ter, rnding June 30, had reached the
a.tonishing f.gure of $<l,12n,018 with
an extra dividend of 1 per cent declared
on the common stock, amountmg to
$6,0a*r0t9. even the most optimistte
students of the steel industry were
surprised.
.1. Pierpont Morgnn. Henry C. Frick
and lieorge F. Baker, president of the
First National Bank, all three director.
of the corporation, stood together in
the elevator at 71 Broadway after the
nirectors' meeting.
"Your father would have liked to see
this meeting tn-day," said Mr Frick.
as he laid his hand on Mr. Morgan's
shoulder.
$1,000,000 a Pay Profit.
The earnings announced yesterday!
are the biggest for three months ever
declared in the history of the corpora?
tion. They represent a profit in steel
of almost $1,000,000 a day. they are
more than $20,000,000 in excess of the ,
three months' earnings made publie in |
th" statement for tha quarter ending
March 11.
The most optimistic Wall Street
prophets forecast figures between $72.- j
000,000 and $79,000,000. The general
Bgare put forth, however. was about |
$75,000,000. An extra dividend was ex
peetad fai a time. but recently Wall
Street had been given to skeptiosm.
An idea of the tremendous increase
in the .teel trade can be gained from
the past figures of the corporation ln
1901 net earnings amounted to $P'.0,
964,(71, tha grcatest year the corpora
tion tver had. In 1966 enrniiigs were
$166,624,972. The net earnirgs for six'
months of thi- year amount to $141,
689,672, against $l.,>0?','Jt>,012 for the

"It |a now compulsory upon children

senior surgeon in charge of the Publie
Health campaign. "They will be is.ued
only upon the presentation to the sur?

by Pr. Simon Flexner and Pr. John S.
Hillings, Peputy Health Commissioner,
that the Rockefellcr Foundation Com?
mittee, which has been empowered to

sources of the disease, has discovered
that the plague is spread by personal

by objects or by the germs being car?

This fact developed at a conference

ports of thirty nurses and five physi
cians who have been doing tield work
were gone over.
"The work of the committee," said
Pr. Flexner, "tended to prove what we
had helieved, that the disease is spread
by personal contact. For instance, a

N. Y. TROOPS
MAY BE HELD
UNTIL XNAS
Likely to Eat Holiday
Dinner on Border.
Says O'Ryan.
MEN FEAR LOSS
OF THEIR JOBS
Wonder if President Will
Dare to Keep Them
There So Long.
By ROBERT H. ROHDE.
Headquarters Sixth Field Pivision,
V. S. A., McAllen, Tex., July 25. If
Henry Ford really has relinqmshed his ;
designs on the Presidency and wants to
turn professional pacifist again these
New York camps offer an exeellent op
portunity to revive the old peace ship
slogan:
"Out of the trenches by Christmas!"
Ever since Major General John F.
O'Ryan arrived h*re one of the ques
tions has predomiiated all those asked
him. That question has concerned the
length of time of tie guard troops' stay
on the border. Jo-day for the first,
time a direct an.^r was given.
"We'll probablye\eat our Christmas
dinner here," said the general.
Before that. General O'Ryan, who
only within the last day or two has
been meeting the newspapermen in
pcrson. had replied to another ques?
tion:
"You ask me how long we are to
.tey? H donn't seem that iuch a
sjawry* ?. ?? ****-. We've only ju.t
got here."
i Adds Nothing to Gayety.
To-day's news isn't likely to add
much more to the gayety of the camps
than this afternoon's dust storm Not
that the men are letting down in the
natter of patnoti.m and willingness
to fight if there la reai fighting to do,
but they are beginning to feel some?
thing like those Mexican invaders of
an earlier day behind whom Elsenor
Cortez sank the transports. Instead
of ships it is employers with the
guardsmen; it is not hulls but jobs'
that are being scuttled.
The men brought over by Cortez,
quite a few years before there was
sueh a city a. Washirgton or such a
policy as Watchful Waiting, were a
different sort of adventurers than
those who are lying on their arms.
The.e men are neither free agents
nor freebooters. Behind most of them
are families and business, profession?
al practices and positions on which
they and their families are dependent.
Exact information concerning the
attitude of specific employers is hard
to get. General O'Ryan has started
to eompile it. So have commanders, ;
but they are, perhaps, over-anxious
to have their ca.es eomplete before
they are presented to the publie,
leaving each to long-distance corre- ,
spondence to bring corroboration. '
However, it would seem from tha talk
which drifts through the camps and
fraaa the worriment that daily is be- ,
coming more manifest among the men
who have others than themselves to
worry about that a great number of
those who heard the eagle screaming
a few weeks ago, li.tened intently and
promised all sorts of favor through
their cashiers, are now turned deaf.
"Will the Preaident Pare?"
When the word from General O'Ryan
spread through the camp streets here
and to Mission and Pharr on the flanks
- the first word that has had the
weight of even quasi-authenticity the
guardsmen from New York echoed. of
ficers and men alike:
"Will he dare to do it?"
The "he" they meant was the Presi?
dent. Regardless of what elements of
diplomacy may enter into the situa
tion, the holding of the guardsmen on
the border is looked on here ag a seri
ous politieal blunder, as serious a blun
der as might be charged against Mr.
Wilson in his whole Administration.
Pemocrats are in the minonty among
the guardsmen as it is, but even their
votes are likely to be saenficed to the
watchful waiting policy.
In anticipation, perhaps, of the eriti
cism of the camps which Dr. Darlington
i. expected to register, this atatement
was issued today by General O'Ryan:
"The camp. of the New York Di
vision, and the facilitiea thereat, are
.atisfactory to the officers and men
of the division. I know from extracts
which appear in the New York newspa?
per. just received here that the con
ditions are also satisfactory to Major
General Tasker H. Bliss, as.istant chief
of staff of the army, who recently viait
ed the camps in comp.ny with ?taff offi?
cers and made an exhaustive study of
the conditions."
The body of Clark J Martin, mounted
orderly with the 69th Infantry. who
succumbed to a combination of sun
.troke and pneumonia, was put aboard

London, July 25.- While the Ruisian
armieg on the extreme northern and
southern fronts are recovering from
the desperate fighting of the last few i
dayfl and preparing for fresh on- ;
slaughts against the enemy's linei, 1
General BrussilofT again has taken up i
the fight along the Northern Galicia
frontier.
To-day Berlin admits the loss of Lin
singen's tirst line of defence on two
fronts in this region south of Ston
owka and south of Berestechk. At the
latter point the opposing forces are
now seesawing back and forth acrosi
the border line, with each day marking;
fresh successes for the Russian arms.
Along the river Slonevka, a branch <
of the Styr, a furious battle is in ,
progress, the Russians having broken '
through the Austrian lines and carried
the fighting into the town of Leshny. :
One thousand prisoners were bagged
and guns were captured and turned
against the flceing Teutons.
Kussiana Clear l.ipa.
The entire line of the Lipa River is
now in the har.ds of General Sakharoff.
No longer do the official communiques
speak of engagements immediately
along the stream. From its confluence
with the Styr to the hills whieh form
B ring around Mirkow, where the Lipa
has its source, Russian troops com
mand both hanks, and at several points
have left the river ten or fifteen miles
in the rear.
Slowly and stubbornly the Austrians
are being forced back to their only
lines of lafety ia thia region north of
the upper Bug. Here, with Vladimir
Volynski on their left flank. and only
partiallv protected from dangerous at?
tack, they must either stand :irm
against thfl Russian advanee or r-> 1*1
their hold on the Vladimir Volynski
Kovel line.
Kovel apparently is doomed to face
within the week the same menace
whieh will be hrought against I.emberg
by the envtlopment of Brody. Thrj
latter town can hold out little longer,
in the opinion of military men here.
In the despairing hope of checking
the Rusiian onward movement at some
points along the great line, the Aus?
trians have not only called to the
colors the last available men of th"
empire, but, according to rcports from

SAYS WAR HAS CRAZED
KA1SERS SON-IN-LAW
Duke of Brunswick Called Hope
lessly Insane.
London, July 2n. The Copenhag.-n
correspondent of "The L'xpreis" sends
a story regarding the illness of the
Duke of Brunswick, the (ierrnan F.m
peror's son-in-law, the story, however,
not being confirmed from any other
source
"The Duke of Brunswick," says the
correspondent, "who has been the vic
tim of profound melancholia since tht
early days of the war, n now declared
to be hopelessly insane. His mentai
collapse wa- the result of a trying ex
perience while commanding a detach
ment of German troopi on the Russ.an
frontier, when he witnessed the tragic
fate of his men, all of whom were
swallowed up in a trearheroua marsh."
The Duke of Brunswick, as Prmee
F.rnest Augu?t of Cumberland, married
Princess Victoria I.uise, daughter of
the German Fmneror, at Berlin m Ma\.
1913. In Marcn, 19KS, a Copenhagen
di.pateh reported the duke to be suf
fering from a nervou* hreakdown,
whieh was considered probably incur
able.

Battle Continues.
fBy <"t? v> Th* TnVin* 1
London, July 25.?Desperate Ger?
man counter attacks that failed,'
Britiah and French attacks that won
only a little, with violent hand-to
hand fighting and the ceaseless
pounding of %aa Vr guns on both
sides marked the day along the
Somme front. The Germans have
prepared a tremendous counter of?
fensive, which they expect to oust
the British, aceording to press dis
patches from Berlin, while the Allies
are setting themselves, under th*
heavy cannonade, for yet another
attempt to clear the vital Albert
Ridge.
The German preparations for their
counter drive have been enormous.the
dispatehes indicate. The rog-iments
depleted in the recent fighting have
been filled or withdrawn, new units
taking the places of the latter; new
guna have been brought up, store;
of ammunition accumulated, and re
serves prepared. Everything ia de
clared to be ready for the blow,
which only awaits favorable weather.
Drives All Repulsed.
General Haig's reports are con
sidered encouraging, in spite of the
small gains, because of the inability
of the Germans to retrieve the
ground they have lost. The German
drives ai^ the heaviest sinro the
Allied offensive began, but the Brit?
ish are nr-eting them with apparent
ease, though miles from their bases.
The salitnt of Longufval formed
by the Deville Weed was the target
for the most desperate of the Ger?
man attacks, launched from the
south, east and north. These broke
down under the British artillery and
maehine gun tire, and even the fore
most attackers failed to reach the
new British iines.
(.am i,round ln Pozieres.
Another attack wa. launched in day
light against the eastern ?ide of the
British positions at Pozieres, after the
Australians had gained more ground in
their third day'. gruellmir hand-to
hand fighting. This, too, broke down
before coming to handgnps. The
projrress of the Anzac men her.- is per
ticularly valuable, because the cleannir
of the three hills on which Fozieres
stands will enable them to enfila.ie the
Thiepval works, hitherto impregnable
against the most gallant atta.-ks, and
also to close the neek of the Leip.ic
salu-nt, insuring the capture of the
great redoubt and its defender..
The French .here of the day'. fight
ino; has been the winning of some
powerfully fortitied houses by a drive
near Estrees and the ou.ting of the
Germans from trenches in the netgh
borhood of Vernandovillers, near the
southern end of th.' hattlefield.
Desperate Fighting Futile.
Along the reat of the Somme front
there have been no >ran.s for * ither
side in spite of desperate fighting. The
Germans report a combined Anglo
French assault which, they say, broke
down with h.-avy losses. The Hranden
burgers and Saxons are declared to
have distinguished themselves, though
no success for them is chronicled The
French success at Kstrees, lierlin say.,
was temporary, and resulted in severe
losses.
