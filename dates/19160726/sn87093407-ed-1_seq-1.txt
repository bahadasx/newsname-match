NOTORIOUS PRISONER TALKS
TO GIRL REPORTER TELLS HER
OF HIS LIFE AND AMBITIONS
Mid Cornelia Class, girl reporter on Th« Star, has Interviewed Logan Billingsley In jail, where he is held on • charge of first degree
murder. She gives an interesting insight into the character of thle young man, who. with other members of hie family, has been warned
by Mayor Gill and other c'ty authorities that the town "le going to be made too hot" to hold them. Miss Class' etory follows:
BY CORNELIA GLASS
| MET a man yesterday who has a queer twist in his moral make>up.
* Hi. name is Logan Billingsley, and he is held in the city jail on a charge of murdet
in the first degree.
When the policeman brought him out of his cell into the room where I was waiting,
I saw a rather slight young man, very pale, with brown eyes and dark curling hair.
One hand was thrust deep into the pocket of his rough brown tweed overcoat, and the
other, hanging at his side, was fingering .a soft black hat.
I told him who I was and what I wanted.
"I have come for a personal story ot you—just about you and nothing else," I explained.
Mr. Billingsley answered in the slow, drawling voice of the South, with slurred consonants and broad
voweh. He was quite willing to talk of himself it I would find it interesting, he assured me.
He was born in Tennessee. His grandfather fought in the civil war under I.ee. Most of his life, until
he came here, has been spent in the South, in Tennessee and Oklahoma, with his three brothers and his
father and mother. He has never married.
At one time he was state manager for Oklahoma of the North American Life Insurance company.
Doesn't Mind Being Arrested for v
Bootlegging, But Murder—That's Different
"1 have several pictures of "company banquets in the Astor House in New York on the walls of my
drug store." he drawled.
Later, I reached his drug store—the Day and Night—just in time to see the pictures before the axes
of the dry squad crushed them.
"That is all there is about me, I reckon," he went on.- "except that I have been arrested several times
for violating the liquor law. Ido not understand this time why lam held. They tell me it's an open
charge. If it is liquor violation again, I do not mind, but if they are trying to connect me with this murder
it is a very different thing. Murder is serious."
"You do not consider the violation of the liquor law a serious thing, then?" I asked.
He has a trick of holding his head a little to one side, which strengthened the impression of laziness
created by his drawling speech. At my question he brought his head up with more celerity than I had yet
seen him show.
"No," he answered, "1 do not think it wrong to sell any commodity for which there is an economk
demand, as long as one does it honestly and frankly, treats every one right and pays his debts."
His animation ebbed again.
"1 believe that manv laws that afe made by the courts are bad," he went on. "I THINK MANY MAN
MADK LAWS ARE BETTER DISREGARDED— MOST OH THEM, IN FACT. Please do not misunder
stand. I do not believe in lawlessness —"he shrugged his shoulders—"l find it rather difficult to say what
1 wish to say."
Selling Whisky Is His Profession, He Says,
One He Means to Follow, No Matter Where He Is
"Perhaps you mean that all good laws are natural laws, anyway, and will be followed as such," I
suggested.
"Yes," he said, "that is what I mean."
He smiled whimsically.
"I have been called a bootlegger often, but 1 do not deserve that. I have sold lots of whisky when the.
authorities did not want me to, but 1 was always perfectly open about it. 1 have a government license to
sell whisky and it is my present profession, one I propose to follow, no matter where I am. I know that I
have always treated every one as a gentleman should."
He laughed outright.
"But I think I will quit now, at least in Seattle," he said. "There is too much publicity in connection
with it, and I dislike publicity. I have paid enough fines into the city treasury for one man, I think."
1 thanked him for talking to me. He assured me that it had been a pleasure, and the policeman led him
back to his cell.
Never once during the interview did he lose his attitude of cool indifference to his surroundings, nor the
air of gentility that made the bare little waiting room seem a natural place to meet.
Never for a second did he cease to be the "gentleman" his ideal of himself demanded.
And going down in the elevator I could not help but think of the rather nice distinction between "gentle
man" and "man." .i
