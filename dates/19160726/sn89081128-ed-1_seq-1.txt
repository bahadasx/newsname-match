CONDITIONS ALONG BORDER
PEACEFUL AS A SUNDAY
AT HOME
Llano Grande, Texas
Saturday, July 22.
Special to the Review.
The 2nd Regiment of the Minnesota
National Guard is encamped about
3 miles southwest of Mercedes, Texas,
and nearly 5 miles from the Mexican
border. Between the guardsmen and
the border are the regulars and the
Texas Rangers so the boys fear that
they will never see any actual service.
The first battalion train pulled into
Llano Grande at 10:20 Wednesday
morning. After unloading all the bag
gage and freight the boys lined up in
heavy marching order and marched
to their camping place, nearly a mile
from the station. The day was hot
and the boys had not walked for quite
a while, so it was hard for them to march
thru the sand.
Fortunately the camping grounds had
been somewhat cleared. The boys had
to burn the brush piles which made
the day seem doubly hot. After
the tents were put up the boys had a
light supper.
There was little or no rest for the
Co. A boys the first night as they had
to go on guard at 8 o'clock. The first
relief went on guard with fixed bayonets.
Later on each man received 5 rounds
of ammunition with strict orders to
keep the clip in the belt. The boys
were told to challenge in the following
manner and to fire at the last command
if not obeyed.
"Halt, who goes there?"
"Halt." (The boys were told to
x(pad
here.)
"Halt or I fire."
The only one to make use of the last
command was Charles LaDuke. He
claims that he saw a Mexican trying
to get thru the line. The officers
seemed to think that LaDuke loaded
and fired and then intended to askafflicted
questions, so he was put in the guard
house over night.
"Bloody's" shot wasn't heard arc and
the world but it was enough to keep
the Co. A boys awake, that is while
on guard. Nothing else happened that
night nor since and nobody expects
anything to happen. The camp is as
peaceful as Camp Bobleter but so farby
the boys have had to work hard to
clean up the grounds. The first days
the meals were somewhat irregular
and not up to the standard but now
things are getting back to the former
standard. The water at first seemed
bad but after the boys got used to the
alkali it was not so bad. The water
is warm but there are "canteens" only
a short ways from camp where the
boys can get ice cold lemonade.
The climate does not seem to effect
the boys. The thermometer registers
higher than up north but the heat is
not so oppressive and there is always
a breeze The only things that trouble
the boys, besides work, are the scorpions
and spiders. Many have bought cots
and some have made some. There are
but few mosquitoes.
All the New Ulm boys are now well
tho some of them were feeling rather
bad the first days, from the effects of
vaccination against small pox and from
the trip.
The boys got their last "shot" against
typhoid fever Saturday morning.
All that is really hard on the boys
is cleaning up the camp grounds and
drinking warm water. After the
grounds are entirely cleared, there
will be a few hours of drill in the fore
noon and the boys will have more time
to themselves.
Friday morning Lieutenant Puhl
mann and Corp. Anton Dewanz in anschool,
attempt to help the cooks made some
biscuits. They turned out hard enough
for Tony to break one of his teeth when
he tried them.
Thursday afternoon Corp. Henry Krie
ger, James Stevens and Henry Junge
hiked to the border to the regular en
campment. The regulars told them
that they have been waiting three years
to get across the border but that there
doesn't seem to be any chance. The
j.,1 31* regulars can't understand what the
y- guardsmen want down here as there
is no danger.
The Indiana troops were mustered
out Friday night and sent home. They
have been here only 10 days so very
few expect to stay here longer than a
month. The Minnesota troops will
no doubt go to San Antonio before
coming home.
All the boys agree that the trip was
worth a great deal. They stopped in
some large cities and saw some fine
scenery.
At Muskogee, Okla., all three battal
ions stopped and took a shower and
swim in the Muskogee shower baths.
At San Antonio they stopped for about
four hours. Ice cream coffee and rolls
were served at the depot. The boys
also took a swim at San Antonio.
A few months training down here in
the dry Texas air will be worth a great
deal to the Minnesota boys. They
will have some hard times once in a
while but hard times and the hot Texas
sun will make strong, tanned, and well
trained men out of what the Southern
papers call "Uncle Sam's pale faced
boys."

STATE OFFICIALS
SEND OUT WARNING
LOCAL DOCTORS NOTIFIED OF
PRECAUTIONS AGAINST
"POLIO"
STRICTEST QUARRANTINE MUST
BE ENFORCED IN EVERY
INSTANCE
Dr. O. J. Seifert is concerned lest
epidemic of infantile paralysis which
has spread with such alarming swiftness
from one end of the country to the other
may reach New Ulm and he has done
everything in his power to enlighten
the people as to what measures to take
to prevent the disease getting a hold in
the community. He calls particular
attention to the fact that as a rule thetf
disease is found in communities wherei
the rules of sanitation are not properly
observed with regard to dust and also
filth in barnyards. The disease mani
fests itself on its first approach as a
slight malady such as children are often
with, feverish conditions, sore
throat and headache, jiot alarming until
the paralysis sets in, and then too late.
Parents should therefore pay particular
attention to the state of the health of
their small children. The scourge
also attacks adults but not so frequently
as very young children.
The following letter was received
Health Officer Seifert this week.
"Since infection may be spread by
nose and throat secretions, and bowel
discharges of patients and convales
cents, and also by well persons who
become "carriers" thru association with
patients, the regulations of the State
Board of Health for prevention of
spread of infection should be enforced
strictly. These regulations require:
Prompt reporting of cases and sus
pected cases
Isolation of patient in screened room
during acute symptoms and convales
cence
Collection of patient's nose, throat
and mouth discharges on cloths which
should be burned at once.
Disinfection of bowels and bladder
discharges before putting into sewer
or cesspool. Where no sewer or cess
pool exists, bowel and bladder dis
charges must be disinfected and after
ward buried in such a manner as
toevents
prevent the access of flies or insects
to them. All articles exposed to possible
infection from the aforesaid discharges
must be cleansed and disinfected.
In case of death the funeral shall
be strictly private.
"Children in the house, and per
sons associated with the patient shall
be kept under observation for two weeks
after last exposure and during this
period must not attend any pubh?,
private, parochial church or Sund .y
or any public or private gathering
whatever. Dogs, cats and other houc
hold pets must be kept out of a house
where infantile paralysis exists.
"Abortive cases are dangerous and
should be isolated under the same pre
cautions as paralyzed cases.
"Fever, headache and pain, mus
cular tenderness, constipation, vomit
ing, drowsiness or irritability, retrac
tion of head, and sore throat, with or
without marked paralysis, characterize
the disease. A slight degree of para
lysis is often overlooked in an infant.
THEREFORE, TAKE NO CHANCES
CALL YOUR DOCTOR TO INVES
TIGATE."

BUSINESS MEN OF NEW ULM BUY
BATHING SITE FOR USE
OF, PUBLIC
LOOK TO MUNCIPAL1TY TO
FURNISH BATH HOUSES
AND EQUIPMENT
Since the hot wave struck New Ulm
the crying need has been for some
place where members of both sexes
could find a place to divest themselves
of all superfluous clothing without in
curring the wrath of the authorities
whose duty it is to conserve the morals
of the citizenry. It is considered per
fectly modest and decent to appear in mix
ed company clad in the briefest of skirts
and skantiest of waists provided only there
is a reason other than the heat for the
disrobing process. When one wants to
cool off, therefore, it is absolutely es
sential that one find a proper excuse.
Bathing furnishes a perfectly proper
and sufficient excuse for behavior that
would secure a free lodging place foi*
the "behaver" under other circumstances.
Hence the throngs that have frequented
the banks of the Cottonwood between
the Bentzin Mill and the Poor Farm
bridge.
However, the dressing rooms pro
vided at this place were even more ab
breviated in their extent than the cos
tumes donned in their seclusion. In
other words, the leafy woods which
constitute the sole screen for the would
be bathers do not offer the privacy that
a strict observance of the customs of
Society demands and it took rather a
daring spirit to complete the disrobing
process without many quakes and
qualms as to what observers might be
at hand. These matters were all care
fully considered by some of the
public spirited men of the city and the
result was announced last Thursday
when it was made known that apiece of
property along the Cottonwood had
been secured for the purpose of locating
a bathhouse for the convenience of those
who found the heat of the city quite
unbearable.
The public spirited citizens this
instances are G. A. Ottomeyer, Henry
N. Somsen and J. A. Ochs. These
gentlemen had been trying for some
time to make a deal with the Bentzin
Milling Company to lease a piece of
land near the mill but the Bentzin
people said that it was necessary for
them to retain control of all land lying
near the mill in order to have the privi
lege of nddmg themselves of people
who might make themselves obnoxious
about the mill, as certain persons m|
every community will do. It being
impossible to lease a site for the bathing
house, the gentlemen decided to pur
chase a four acre piece on the opposite
side of the river from the mill, below
the dam and above the Poor Farm.
The owner, John P. Drexler of Cotton
wood, was approached and signified his
willingness to part with the property
for a consideration, $435.00, which was
agreed upon with the added stipulation
that the buyers pay for a certain amount
of timber which Mr. Drexler desired to
take off the land and which the buyers
preferred to have left standing.
Plans for the use of the land have not
yet been completed. It is expeeted
that in time the City will be given the
the tract with the stipulation that it be
maintained as a public bathing place,
with proper bathhouse facilities. Later
will shape the course to be pur
sued by the men who have secured the
ownership of the tract but it is hoped by
them that their purchase will lead to the
establishment of a big out-of-doors
playground for young and old. The
location is a favorable one for community
outings, the scenery is beautiful, the
river is safe and New Ulm must fall
into line soon with other cities of itsL.
size in providing for healthful and happy
amusements for its citizens.
FOOD POISON'S SOLDIERS IN
TEXAS.
A number of the Minnesota men are
suffering from ptomaine poisoning in the
camps in Texas, due to eating spoiled
canned tomatoes, according to Twin
City papers of Tuesday. The men af
fected were from Minneapolis and
Duluth and no mention was made of
any others.
Several serious cases of dysentery are
reported in the hospitals, caused by in-Ulm
judicious eating of things to be had out
side of the regular fare.
NEW ULM, BROWN COUNTY, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, JULY 26, 1916.
DECISION AGAINST
SWITCHING CHARGE
FARMERS AND MINNEAPOLIS
MILLERS EXPECT TO SAVE
THOUSANDS
LOCAL CONCERNS WILL NOT
REAP ANY PARTICULAR
BENEFITS
Savings of thousands of dollars in
switching charges annually to Minne
apolis milling interests and to farmers
of the Northwest was assured yesterday
in a decision by the Minnesota supreme
court in the first of a series of cases
involving the switching railroads of
Minneapolis.
The supreme court holds this partic
ular road, the Minneapolis Eastern
railway, is really only a part of the
Milwaukee and the Omaha railroads,
which jointly own the Minneapolis
Eastern. That is to say, the owner
of roads may not add to their charge for
carrying grain to terminal houses^ or
mills on the switching roads any more
than they may charge for switching a
car of grain from their main track to
one of their sidetracks.
The switching charge, which has
been collected for many years is $1.50
a car.
Under the decision the roads must
refund the switching charges collected
in the last six years. The court's stand
is believed to forecast a general "iron
ing out" of the switching situation in
the Minneapolis terminal which would
save the public a sum which even
those most familiar with the problems
involved will not attempt to estimate.
The case will be appealed to thebright
United States supreme court, according
to J. B. Sheehan of St. Paul, counsel
for the Omaha.
The immediate effect of the decision
will be the removal of the switching
change on cars delivered to the East
em by lines which are competitive
wlfn1 ihe Omaha and Milwaukee at
points in the grain producing territory
All this indirect effect of the case is
not included in the estimate of $50,000
which will be saved the market and
its shippers.
The decision of the high court, which
was unanimous and comes after a
period of litigation extending from
1912, removes a condition which has
been in operation since the formation
of the Eastern in 1878.
"The decision opens the way for a
general clean up of the tangled switch
ing situation in the Minneapolis ter
minal," said W. P. Trickett, director
of the Minneapolis Traffic association,
which brought the suit. "We are
happy over the outcome of the litiga
tion and look for favorable action
our complaints in similar cases."
The above decision affects the local
mills and elevators but very little.
There has been no switching charge
the strict sense of the word in New
Ulm. All grain cars received by
thebe
mills here from points outside of New
Ulm are switched by the railroad com
panies to the mills without any extra
charge. Should, however, Bingham
Bros, or the New Ulm Farmers' Elevator
Company load a car from their respec
tive elevators and have it transferred
to either of the mills, the railroads
make a charge of $1.50 which is called
a "switching charge" but which,
reality, is only payment for services
rendered for which the railroad companies
have received no other compensation
whatever. It is only when the Farmers'
Elevator or Bingham Bros, ship grain
to some milling concern or elevator in
Minneapolis, that they were subjected
to this switching charge that the Su
preme Court now says is contrary to
law and morals and which must be
refunded for the past six years. H.
Beecher of the Eagle Roller Mill
Company, and for many years in the
railroad business, says that the Eastern
which has been gathering in the switch
ing charges is in reality a combination
of various railroad interests formed
for the purpose of getting at the pocket
books of the shippers by taking charge
of the switching business in the cities.
He says that the mills here will not
be affected in any way by the decision
as they have no shipments handled
by the Eastern.
A. W. Bingham of Bingham Bros,
says that locally they are practically
not affected*at all, because they sell
all their grain to the mills. Whenever
they have elevators outside of New
and ship to Minneapolis, they
have been subjected to this switching
charge and would be entitled to some
\j* su i. A- V$^*i^3N&*i*k ~&s f^&^JL**^ 4
'"ft
of that refund that the Supreme Court
orders. Mr. Bingham does not expect
a check by next mail however, as he
has been informed that the appeal to
the U. S. Supreme Court has already
been perfected and in his opinion it
will take at least two years before this
tribunal gets ready to render a de
cision.
When interviewed by a Review re
porter August Dahl, manager of the
New Ulm Roller Mill Co. stated that
his mill had been up against this switch
ing charge of $1.50 at 'different times.
He says that whenever the mill gets a
car of wheat from* Minneapolis, there
frequently appears among the various
other charges, a charge of $1.50 for
switching. Lately there has been a
let-up on this charge and it seems to
him as tho this charge was inflicted
on concerns outside of Minneapolis
whenever the "Eastern" thought they
would stand for it without a holler.
It will mean some little saving to the
New Ulm Roller Mill Co. because
they have been in the habit of getting
100 or more cars of wheat from the
Minneapolis market every year.
BUCK RUST GETS
BIG PART OF CROP
PRICE OF WHEAT SOARS AS
REPORTS OF DAMAGE
COME IN.
SOUTH DAKOTA FARMERS HIT
HARDEST BY PLAGUE
AND HAIL
In the twinkling of an eye the hopes
for a bumper crop are destroyed and the
visions of splendid returns are
replaced by gloomy prospects of 'wasted
effort. Before the heated spell came on
crops never looked better but the early
part of last week rumors of shrunken,
shnveled kernels of wheat that had been
found the fields pointed to the rust
scourge. The rising wheat market
confirmed the suspicion and the end of
the week saw such a rapid advance as to
convince the most skeptical that enor
mous damage had been done the crops
by the muggy weather.
South Dakota seems to have suffered
most, according to H. L. Beecher. There
not only the black rust but the heat it
self has been too much for the small
grains and piled up on top of these un
favorable conditions has been the da
mage done by hailstorms over extended
areas. The damage is variously esti
mated at 25 to 75 percent of the crop.
In North Dakota conditions are not
so bad. There is still a chance that the
gram may mature without suffering such
great damage on account of the rust but
the only chance lies in dry weather
as damp, hot days will encourage
the growth of the rust spores and a few
days of the muggmess which has recently
afflicted this section will do for the crops
of North Dakota.
Here at home, in the immediate
vicinity, there is a great deal of rust to
found in the fields and all over South
western Minnesota the conditions re
semble those in North Dakota. Con
tinued favorable weather can still save
the crop while a little more of the ex
cessive humidity will result in a great
deterioration of the gram which is just
in the stage to be-badly injured by the
rust spores. August Dahl of the New
Ulm Roller Mill said Monday that
50 per cent damage to the crops of this
section is already reported.
The wheat market reflects the rising
tide of pessimism. Saturday's close
showed an advance of between 4 and 5
cents over Friday's price and Monday's
close was more than 3 cents still higher.
The Minneapolis close on July wheat
Monday was $1.25—1-2 which indicated
a price here for Tuesday of $1.18. The
mills were paying $1.15 here Monday.
The rise of the past five days amounts
to 11 cents
TOO FAST A PACE
While driving at a clip of fifty miles
per hour, Tony Janni, a New Ulm young
marf who is employed in the lumber
yards at Hamburg, Minn., was thrown
from his car when it ran through a
mud hole made by the recent rains.
He was badly bruised over his entire
body and hit the ground on his head
in such a manner as to render him un
conscious for nearly an hour.
Claus A. Swanson of Lafayette has
been appointed Deputy Clerk of Dis
trict Court of Nicollet County. He
received his appointment from Clerk
Wm. Mailgren last week.

PAPER SITUATION
BECOMES SERIOUS
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES DEEM
IT NECESSARY TO MAKE
INVESTIGATION
NEWSPAPERS FIND IT ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE TO SECURE
SUPPLIES
It is the usual business of a news
paper to chronicle the troubles and
difficulties experienced by everybody
and in every other line of business
except that of the newspaper itself. This
year the situation has changed and the
most interesting troubles to the news
paper are those being experienced with
in the newspaper field. Things
have reached reached such a pass
that the newspapers for their own
salvation must publish the vital facts
and must bring the public to a realiz
ation of the conditions that exist in
order that everything may be done to
correct the evils of the situation.
The American Newspaper Publishers
Association has taken the matter up
with publishers all over the United
States and has asked them to co-operate
to reduce the consumption of news,
print. Figures given by the Association
show that during the first five months
of the present year the news print
mills of the United States and Canada
delivered approximately 800,000 tons of
news print, an increase of about 13 per
cent over deliveries of the corresponding
months of the previous year. This is
at the rate of about 1,900,000 tons per
annum, or 150,000 tons in excess of
1915 deliveries.
Notwithstanding this largely increased
production of news print—approximate
ly double the normal average increase—
there has been so great consumption
that the mills have not supplied the
demand, and there is much concern
regarding the future.
During the first five months of the
year, 26,901 tons of news print were
exported from the United States, as
compared with 18,862 tons for the same
period of 1915, and 19,102 tons for the
same period during 1914. During
the same period imports from Canada
increased over 63,000 tons.
Ordinarily, mills expect to begin to
accumulate stock during the latter
part of May for the fall and winter
demand. However, up to the present
time there has been no appreciable
evidence of reduction of consumption
and that leads to the conclusion that
if consumption of news print be not
immediately reduced there may be a
greater shortage of supply next winter
than has been the Base dunng the past
few months. This conclusion is empha
sized by the fact that machines to pro-,
duce any material increase of new ton
nage seem not to have been provided
by the manufacturers.
During the early part of the year, the
Association drew the attention of its
membership to the conditions existing
and has since been urging its members
to practise every economy, with the re
sult that a material saving has been
made through the elimination of waste.
The situation, however, is now so serious
that the attention of every publisher is
called to present conditions and all
are urged to either individually or in
co-operation with other publishers, take
active steps to cut down the consump
tion of news print. Newspapers pub
lished in the largest cities have made
reductions of from three to ten tons
per day by practising economies and one
New York newspaper has reduced its
consumption eight tons a day through
the elimination of returns, as papers
are designated which are ordered by
news agents and then not sold.
It is estimated by one Minneapolis
daily paper that at the present price
of news print, it will cost them $33,000.00
more next year to issue their paper than,
it has in the past. This enormous ad
vance in costs will have to be met by
some one and the publishers are hardly
in a position, even if they were willing
to bear it themselves. What is true of
the large plants, is true in a lesser de
gree in every small country shop. The"
Review is printed at the present time
on paper stock that costs just twice
as much as the same sheet cost in Febru*
ary of this year.
The more serious feature of the sit
uation, however, is the chance of being
unable to secure sufficient paper to
run on. There is at this office, stock
on hand to print the paper for something
like two months. Whether more will
be obtainable before that time ex?
