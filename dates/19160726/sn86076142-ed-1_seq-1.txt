WASHINGTON, July 26 Appor
tionment among the states of the
first year's appropriation of 15,000.000

and Nevada S64.0OO. Texas gets the
most $291,000. j
Before making the division the de
partment deducted $150,000, which
waa set aside by the act for adminis
tration. The first installment ia for
the fiscal year ending June, 1917. In
addition a million ia appropriated
each year for the development of
rural roads and national lorenis.
This is the first step in the federal
government's part of spending $ir,0.

The $150,000,000 la to be paid hair

several states', apportioned among the
latter according to their respective
area, population and rural mail route

The expenditures are authorized by
the Sliackleford-Bankhead good roads
law, the first granting federal aid to
states in road building. Appropria
tions fur the present year, ending
July 1, 1917. authorized by Congress,
are $5,000,000. For (the four succeed

Every cent of the federal and state
funds, the act provides, shall be spent
to build new ' roads. Maintenance
costs thereafter must be borne by the

RouteB and construction materials
of the new roads are to be finally
determined by the secretary of agri
culture. No public road can be built
under the law until its location, cost
and character are approved by him.
Every road project with plans, speci
fications and costs estimates must be
given his approval before any of the
federal money shall be available.
There Is no specific requirement that
such roads shall be permanent, but
the act declares they shall be "sub

being given discretion to construe
the question of substantiabllity in
each separate case.
