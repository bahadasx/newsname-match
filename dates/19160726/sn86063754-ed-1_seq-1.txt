Rivers Record on Ways and
Means Committee
Below is a letter written vol
untarily by the chairman of the
ways and means committee, Mr.
J. T. Liles, to Hon. J. C. Rivers
in regard to Mr. Rivers work on
this committee:
Orangeburg, S. C. July 12.?I
learn with pleasure, that you are
a candidate for re-election to the
House of representatives, and I
predict success for you, if the
good people of your county are
informed as to the splendid work
you have done as a reoresenta
live.
I would not undertake to advise
a Legislator of your expe
rience how to conduct a campaign
tor re election, but if I
were vou I would emphasize the
stand that you took for economy,
and I would tell the people how
difficult it was for the Ways and
Means committee to withstand
the pressure brought to bear upon
them for large and in many
instances, needless appropriations.
It may sound like self praise
for a member of our committee
to speak of the splendid record
made by the committee at the
session of 1916, but the people of
the State should know, because
of the many favorable comments
made that a new standard
' was raised for the right kind of
economy in the administration
of the finances of the State.
Notwithstanding the successful
effort made to keep the levy
down to where it wouldn't prove
? i i ? <
u uuiucu upua tue people, we
provided for the rural schools of
South Carolina more liberally
then they have ever been provided
for before. You perhaps,
will recall that the rural schools
of more
during the year 1916 than
they have ever received, and in
this connection I wish to again
thank you for your splendid ef
forts and cooperation in securing
a favorable consideration of
the appropriation for the common
schools. You did splendid
work along this line, and it
seemed to me that you realized
fully that the rural schools de
served more consideration than
they have ever received, and the
fight you made for them was a
commendable one.
I am writing you this, because
I think you deserve it, and be
cause as 1 grow older I feel
more and more inclined to say a
word of encouragement to those,
who in mv judgement, are frying
to contribute to the upbuild
ing of their State.
We had our difficulties. We
did not agree on all things, and
the responsibility that was upon
us and the hard work that we
were required to do, often times,
had a tendency to make us irratable
and unwilling to acceed
to all men the right of
their opinion, yet through it all
1 always knew that old Rivers
would sland by me, and I sin
cerely hope that he will remem
ber our association with pleasure.
I wish that I could be of service
to you, and if there is anything
that I can do to help you 1
iu any way, aon t Hesitate to call
upon me.
J. T. Liles.

Had to Give Bond to Get Married
Monroe Enquirer.
Clerk of Court R. W. Lem
mood in re-filing old county papers
last week ran across a
number of papers and instruments
that are not only interesting
from the standpoint of the
sentimental references they
make but from the information
they give that has been practically
forgotten bv the oeoDle of
the present age.
Few persons in Monroe or
Union county remember that
something like 70 years ago a
man had to give a heavy bond
before he could get married, nor
is it a well known fact that the
money standards here were
made out in the old English
pounds, shilling and pence system.
An old paper telling of the
marriage of Mr. W. M. Richard
son and Miss Jane Laney will
strike deep interest to the many
descendants of this venerable
old pair, both of whom have
passed to the world beyond, but
just fead how their marriage license
was worded:
"State of North Carolina,
county of Union. Know all men
by these presents; That we, W.
M. Williams and Russell Rogers,
in the State aforesaid, are held
firmly bound to the State of
North Carolina in the just and
full sum of Five Hundred
Pounds, current money of the
State: To the which payment,
well and truly to be made and
done, we bind our heirs, executors
and administrators. Sealed
with our seals, and dated this
20th day of March, 1844.
"The condition of die above
obligation is such, that whereas
ardson, hath made application
for a license for a marriage, to
be celebrated between him and
Tane Laney, of the county aforesaid:
Now in case it shall not
appear, hereafter, that there is
any lawful cause to obstruct the
said marriage, then the above
obligation is to be void, otherwise
to remain in full force and
virtue.

The oldest license on record
among the Union county records
was granted to W. M. Carelock
and Ruby G. Hamilton April 12,
1843. The county was establish

What Went Down the River.
Waxhaw Enterprise.

the river saw a watermelon go
down stream with a rabbit on
one end and a terrapin on the
other.
The roof of a cabin with a tile
stove flue resembling a German
submarine with a periscope.
Hundreds of bales of cotton
washing down the river, considered
with the thousands of acres
of cotton land submerged along
the banks, looked like die river
was aiding in everv way possible
the farmer to get fifteen
cents for his cotton.
Two men in a gasoline motor
boat were joy-riding over the
seething mass of wreckage,
waving to the people along the
bank. Another man in a paddle
canoe was having just as good a
lime as anybody. Still another
fellow, unable perhaps to secure
a motor boat, was riding a log.
He did not seem to be enjoying
the ride quite as much as the
others.

Baptist Sunday School Convention
The Chesterfield Baptist Sunday
school convention convened^
in annual session at Thompson
Creek church Friday morning
at 10:30. The meeting was called
to order by the president, Mr.
J. F. Crawley, and devotional excises
were conducted by Rev. J.
|K. Haire.
Messrs. J. F. Crawley and J. H;
White were reelected president'
and vice president respectively.
A. F. Funderburk was elected.
I secretary. i
Delegates were then enrolled.
The attendance was Dot large,
due perhaps to the rains, bad
roads, full streams and broken;
bridges. Rev. J. K. Haire preached
a very strong sermon, and
the meeting adjourned for dinner,
which proved a real feast. 1
Keports snowing the progress
of the work in the schools of the
county were heard after the
noon hour. Mrs. A. F. Funderburk
then addressed the meeting
on the subject of missions and
mission study. Her talk was;
highly enjoyed and no doubt
much benefit was derived therej*
from. Bro. J. Arthur Knight
then made a very strong and impressive
address, his subject be->
ing, "The Sunday School and
Service." Rev B. D. .Thame*
preached a very strong and
highly appreciated sermon to
the convention, his theme being
''Sunday School and Evangelical
Work."

participated, making it a very]
interesting service. In the ab?1
sence of Rev. R. W
subject "Spir*ual Lite of a Sunday
School" was ably discussed
by Rev. J. K. Haire. The convention
owes much to Mr. Haire,
as he was always ready to fill
the place of the absent ones.
The committee on time and
place of next meeting, consisting
of J. R. Melton, H. Z. Outen,
John G. Hursey, reported Chesterfield
as the place, and Friday
before the 4th Sunday in July
1917 as the time.
The Convention ordered the

cow boy audience about the
prodigal son. He described in
detail the foolish bov's extravagance
and dissipation; his penury
and his husk eating with the
swine; he told of his return, his
father's loving welcome, and the
preparation of the fatted calf.
The preacher in his discourse
noticed a cowboy staring at him
very hard. He thought he had
made a convert, and addressing
the cowboy personally he said
from the pulpit: "My dear friend,
what would you have done if
you had had a son returning
home like that?"
"Me?" said the cowboy promptly
and fiercely. "I'd have shot
the boy and raised the calf."
Appeal For Aid for Flood Suffers
;
That there is destitution and
Heed in certain flooded districts
of Western North Carolina,
especially in Ashe, Wilkes, Allegheny,
Watauga counties on
the upper waters of the Catawba
and Yadkin river valleys, is
^he information received by The
^Observer and along with the information
comes the request for
outside aid. Governor Craig
has issued a proclamation ap
pointing a State committee to re
A;eive ana nanale tunds and to
the end that The Observer may
co operate, it urges such of its
.readers that may feel constrained
to aid in this enterprise to forward
subscriptions to this paper,
\which will make the proper acknowledgements
or send them
to the State committee in Ralueigh
direct.
The need is said to be very
great and the situation is such
that instant action is imperative.
In these mountain counties
where there are so many streams
[and where the people made their
| homes for the most part in the
[valleys, the destruction of prop
terty and the isolation of comImunities
has been much greater
rthan elsewhere. In many of
dhese localities the devastation is
said to have been on a parity
with the Catawba valley in the
actual path of the flood. Fortunately
for the lower reaches of
river, few people resided on the
I banks of the stream and hence
escaped, but in the mountainous

Print Deposits
cdmiswils -by
their finger prints has been for a
long time a recognized police
practice, but it is only within recent
months that this method of
identification has been put to
more constructive use.
It has been the custom in
most banks to refuse to take accounts
unless the depositor
could sign his name. Thus many
foreigners and even a few Americans,
who have never learned
to write, were barred from opening
savings accounts.
In a number of banks in large
cities, however, the finger print
system has been adopted, and
persons who have never learned
I to write may now open savings
accounts. The fingers of the
right hand are pressed lightly
on a glass plate that has been
covered with specially prepared
ink. The impression is transferred
to a card, which is filed in
the bank. Then, whenever a
depositor wishes to draw out his
money, he can easily identify
himself by his finger prints. It
is believed by the institutions
that have installed the new
method that it will always be
used for minors, because the
markings on the hand form a
far more reliable means of identification
than the signature.
Handwriting changes with maturity,
but the finger markings
remain the same from youth to
the end of a man's life. One of
the phenomena of life is that out
of millions of finger prints that
are on file in the cities of the
United States, no two finger
prints have ever been found that
are exactly alike.
Sliding in Grease

Great Poet, James W. Riley,
Dead
Indianapolis, Ind., July 22.?
James Whitcomb Riley, the Indiana
poet, died this evening.
Riley suffered fiom the extreme
heat all day but was
thought to be resting easy tonight.
He asked his nurse for a
drink of water at 11 o'clock.
When she returned with it he
I
was dead.
Death was due to a stroke of
paralysis.
Rilev, born of the Middle
West, sang the joys, sorrows,
fancies and humors of its folk,
largely in its own dialect. The
world was so touched by his
inspiration and the realism of
his homely symbols that he was
one of the few, that, devoting
their lives to poetry, gained a
fortune.

Axiiey was peculiarly sensitive
as to the advance of age and
evaded inquiries as to the date
of his birth but the most accurate
information available indicates
that he was born in 1848,
"Should vou ask his age," one
of his friends said, "he would
answer 'This side of forty,* and
leave 3tou to guess which side."

Some years ago, when Nan- i
sen, the explorer, visited this j
country after his return from x
one of his Polar expeditions, he 3
was the guest of honor at a re- t
ception given by a women's \
club in Philadelphia. The mem- j
bers passed him in single file to
shake his hand and express their j
pleasure at meeting him.
Presently there came along a '
little middle aged woman, plainly
in a high state of embarrassment.
Nansen took her hand 1
and bowed his head to hear 1
what she might have to say.
Owl-eyed, she stared at him f
without a word. There was an s
awkward pause. It was the lady
who broke it.
"Oh, Mr. Nansen," she blurt- *
ed, "our cook is a Scandinavian n
too!" , t
Mack Davis Suicides
Chesterfield, fuly 21.?Mack
Davis, assistant cashier of the
Peopls bank, aged about 40 years,
was found dead of gunshot
wound, supposedly self inflicted,
in the graded school building
this morning about 8 o'clock.
As was his custom, he rose
very early this morning, telling
his wife that he was going to
walk over to his farm, about
two miles from town. As he
did not return when expected,
his wife began to get anxious
about him but did not suspect
anything had happened to him.
A little girl playing near the
school building ran in for a moment
and saw the body but did
not recognize it.
The weapon used was a douK1~

and no one suspecied that there

Mr. Davis' books at the bank
were in perfect order and his
affairs generally were in good
condition.
Coldest Over Equator.
Geographical Review.
Winds blow not merely along
the surface of the earth, but upward
and downward throughout
the atmosphere. They whirl
about in directions. So it is impossible
to construct a weather

direction of the winds, for such
a chart would have to be in
three dimensions.
Prof. Alexander McAdie of
Harvard describes some of the
ftecent experiments in the tipper
air performed by sounding -ba!r.,
loons. The atmosphere has,
roughly, two layers, the lower
called the troposphere and the
upper, the stratosphere.
The statosphere is highest over
the equator and lowest over the
poles, but its height varies with
the season. "At the equator,"
says Prof. McAdie, "as we rise
in the air the temperature continues
to fall to a much greater
height than in temperate latitudes.
Indeed, the lowest temperature
is found above the
equator."
Before the war "seamen's return"
tickets were issued by
most railway companies from
seaport towns at reduced rates,
says London Answers. A welldressed
young man asked for
one of these tickets the other
day, but the booking clerk demurred.
"Seamen's return tickets are
issued onlv to sailors," he snapped.
"Well, 1 am a sailor," was the
reply of the applicant.
"But how am I to know that
/our statement is correct?"
"How are you to know it"
:ame the answer. "Why, you
eather-neckcd son of a sea cook,
f you feel mv starboard boom
unning foul of your headlights
you'll know that I've been doing
nore than sitting on a stool
Seating: all my life, and you'll

The station master was standng
nearby.
"'Give him a ticket," he said;
'lie is a sailor.",
Anna, the old family servant,
was sitting with her feet prop>ed
