that the Mexican membership of the
proposed commission to seek a solution
of border difficulties had been selected.
Mexlro Ia Delaying.
Preliminary conferences between act
ing secretary of state Polk and Mr
Arredondo have so far failed tn nm.
duce any definite result. It is under
stood the Washington government de
sires that the powers of the commission
be far greater than Gen. Carranza has
proposed and that Mr. Arrendondo some
days ago forwarded such a suggestion.
Delay of the defacto government in
making known its views on the new
suggestions and the fact that inaccu
rate statements as to the status of tip.
; gotiatlons have been made in Mexico
City inclined some officials here today

Militia Defends Country Wilson.
In reply to a complaint from Mrs.
Henry Smith, of Winamac, Ind who has
a son In the national guard, president
Wilson wrote today that the guard was
beins kept on the Mexican border to
protect the country, not for drill, and
that the service the men were perform
ing was an honor to them and a neces
sity to the United States.
Letter Distresses President.
The president's letter was made pub
lic to answer to criticism that national
guardsmen are not being" cared for
properly. It follows-
"Your letter of July 23 distresses ma
a good deal because It showa that you
the purpose of having the national
guard at the border It is not for the
purpose of drill, but for the purpose of
protecting the country. The service the
men are performing there is an honor
to them and a necessity to the United
States. I cannot believe that the men
in the national guard would wish to
be excused from it or would lose heart
because of the discomforts and incon
veniences of the service.
Sympathizes With Siother.
"The war department has the camps
on the border under the most careful
inspection and is using every mean
known to maku them sanitary and
safe against disease. The healtR record
of the men on the border, both the res
ulars and the national guardsmen, is
exceptionally good.
I would not have you think that I
do not swmpathize with your distress in
the absence of your son. bnt I beg that
vou will take these larger matters n'o
consideration."
