Parkor, Commanding Ollicerof

Colonel Leedy tu give the

Leave of absence is given the

They can to Brownsville if
they euro to, and must in- blick
and in bed by ten o'clock.
There ure a good many sore
arms as a result of the typhoid
vaccine injections and the small

good. Authorities claim that
this section of country is as
healthy as can be found.
The heat iH tor rille, but a con
slant wind blows, and makes
old "Sol" impotent to do any
harm.
The altitude of the Mexicans
who comprise fully seventy live
percent of the population,
everywhere is one of thinly
veiled hostility, and great pre?
cautions are being taken to
avoid any trouble between them
and the soldiers. Orders are
that no notice is to be taken of
insults given by them.
The town of Brownsville is
under martial law, and the
daredevil Texas Hangers do
great service in keeping order
there.
Tim only teal "thorn in tho
llesh" is the absence of pay-day.
For some reason, the Virginia
soldiers have not boon givon
their salaries, and nearly every
Olid is "broke", ami all who
had any money nt all have
been touched heavily.

CALOMEL DYNAMITES A
SLUGGISH LIVER.
Crashes Into Sour Bile, Mak?
ing You Sick and You
Lose a Day's Work.
Calomel salivates! It's mor
cuiy. Calomel acts like dyna?
mite mi a sluggish liver. When
calomel comes into contact
with sour bile it crashes info
it, causing cramping and
nausea.
If you feel bilious, headachy,
constipated and all knocked
out. jiist go to your druggist
and get a 150 cent bottle of Doil
son's Liver Tone, which iR a
harmless vegetable substitute
for dangerous calomel. Take
a R|).if 111 and if it doosn't
start your liver.and straighten
you up better and quicker than
nasty calomel and without
making you sick, yon just go
buck and get your money.
If you take calomel today
you'll be sick and nauseated to?
morrow; besides, it may sali?
vate you, while if you take
Hudson's Liver Tone you will
wake up feeling great, full of
ambition and ready for work or
play. It's harmless, pleasant
ami safe to give to children
they like it.
