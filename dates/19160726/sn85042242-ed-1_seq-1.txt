Somebody gave four of the prison­
ers who escaped from the peniten­
tiary guns and they did this within a
short distance of the institution. This
is the latest development in the in­
vestigation being made by prison offi­
cials into the outside help secured by
inmates in escaping.
If sufficient evidence is secured the
men, it is said, will be prosecuted un­
der the statute which imposes a sen­
tence of from one to ten years in the
state prison.
Bloodhounds Lost Trail.
Descriptions have been furnished
the investigators of suspicious ma­
chines seen in the vicinity of the pris­
on on the morning that the eight men
escaped.
One of the things that points to
automobiles is the fact that the blood­
hounds suddenly lost the trail of the
four of the men not yet found, which
indicates that they were picked up.

The principal activity of the offi­
cials has swung from hunting the men
to running, down clues which might
lead'to the arrest and conviction of
those wh6 assisted. They are confi­
dent fliat the escaped prisoners will
be found, becausc all routes leading
out of the sta£e are guarded and the
police of all thte towns and cities have
been notified. Then, many have vol­
unteered their cervices, both in the
hopes of getting the reward and
through a desire to discourage es­
capes. This has left the regular offi­
cers free to devote most of their en­
ergies to securing evidence against
the outsiders.
CUTSJISELF UP
Dr. Arthur Warren Waite Cuts
Figure of Cross on His
Chest
Sing Sing, N. Y., July 25.—Dr. Ar­
thur Warren Waite, awaiting electro­
cution here for the murder of his fath­
er-in-law, John E. Peck, of Grand Rap­
ids, Mich., was found in his cell in
the "death house" tonight bleeding
from a wound in his chest, made in
the shape of a cross. The prisoner
had cut himself with a piece of brok­
en glass.
How Waite obtained possession of
the glass could not be explained. It
is presumed that when he was taken
out for exercise in the courtyard he
picked it up when the vigilance of his
guard was relaxed, and concealed it
until he returned to his cell.
Waite was removed to the prison
hospital, but he steadfastly refused to
answer questions. The prison author­
ities believe if he had intended to kill
himself, he would have inflicted the
wound' elsewhere than on his chest.
The injury is not serious.
A strict iwatch will be kept on
Waite when he returns to the death
house.

Cruiser Advances Through Vir-

A&t DOES NOT VIOLATE
INTERNATIONAL LAWS
Norfolk, Va., July 2'.—Without
warning to United States officials, one
of the British cruisers lying off ^ape
Henry, awaiting the r.ppearance of
the German submersntes, Deutsch
land and Bremen, steamed through
the Virginia capes today, anil st?am
ed toward Portress Monroo, cruised
about an hour or more, and then re­
turned to a point just outside the
three-mile limit.
The United States warship, Louisi­
ana, and the collicr, Neptune, were
the only government vessels which
lighted the ship, and a d°tailed re­
port was made to Washington tonight
by naval authorities. Officials here
said that while entry into American
water without warning was very un­
usual, they could see in it no viola­
tion of international law, or'naviga­
tion regulations.
Initial knowledge of the presence of
the British vessel in American waters
came when an officer on the Louisiana
sighted her about 500 yards behind
him, just inside Cape Henry. She
waS carrying steaming lights. T'ne
Louisiana proceeded slowly up the
bay until reaching Haven Roads,
when she prepared to stop, and then
noticing the unidentified ship almost
alongside, signaled her. The cruiser
put out man-o'-war lights, and on re­
quest for her identity, signaled "Brit­
ish cruiser," through the darkness. A
heavy fog overshadowed the water at
the time, and the officer of the Louisi­
ana was unable to make out the
cruiser's name. Shortly after display­
ing her cruiser signal the warship
moved on up the bay. Members of

President Determined To Stand
Squarely Behind the Big
Program
QUESTION TEMPORARILY
BLOCKED BY BUCHANEN
Issue Calls for Immediate Con­
struction of Seven Fight­
ing Vessels
•Washington, July 25.—'President
Wilson has determined to stand
squarely behind the increased senate
naval building program. Official word
of his desire that the senate provi­
sions be accepted by the house in
conference was sent from the White
House tonight to administration lead­
ers at the capitol, where conferees
will begin consideration of the naval
bill within a few days.
Representative Buchanan of Illinois,
a member of the naval committee,
temporarily blocked reference to the
measure to conference in the house
today, but administration leaders will
insist on a conference and the rules
committee will be ready to force that
disposition of the bill when the house
meets again Thursday. Representa­
tive Buchanan objected to Chairman
Padgett's request for appointment of
conferees under unanimous consent.
Senate conferees already have been
named.
Vital Question At Stake.
Whether President Wilson's influ­
ence will be sufficient to put through...
vision for immediate construction of
four dreadnaughts and four battle
cruisers, and a three-year continuing
program, is uncertain. During the dis­
cussion in the house today, several re­
presentatives sought to have the sen­
ate conferees bound on certain amend­
ments, but Chairman Padgett insisted
that they be left free to smooth out
differences in the house and senate
measures at their discretion.
The plan for forcing reference to
the conference Thursday was agreed
on by Chairman Padgett, Democratic
Leader Kitchin, Representative Lead­
er Mann, Acting Chairman Harrison of
the rules committee, and Democratic
and Republican members of the naval
committee. Mr. Padgett later intro­
duced a resolution making the neces­
sary parliamentary provision for the
appointment of conferees. Mr. Buch­
anan said his reason for blocking ac­
tion today was that the bill was too
important to be left to conferees.
Secretary Daniels wrote to Chair­
man Padgett today urging that the
senate amendments, stipulating that
the proposed naval laboratory be lo­
cated in the capitol, be stricken out
in conference. He transmitted a let­
ter from the naval consulting board,
suggesting that the location should be
left to the discretion of the navy de­
partment.
HiHTERLETEB HELD

Damaging Testimony at
the Inquest
Olney, 111., July 95.—Roy Hinterliter
was held to the grand jury without
bail today at the conclusion of the
coroner's inquest into the death of
Elizabeth Ratcliffe, 17 years old. A
friend of Hinterliter testified at the
inquest that Hinterliter had boasted
to him of performing an illegal oper­
ation. The autopsy over the girl's
body revealed that there had been no
operation, and that the girl died of
embolism, an obstruction of a blood
vessel—but the commission could not
determine the cause of this condition.
Miss 'Ratcliffe died last Fiday night.
Hinterliter, who was out riding with
her, drove up to a sanitarium and said
that Miss Ratcliffp had fainted. She
was taken into the sanitarium, where
attempts to revive her failed.

DID JEALOUSY, "MADNESS" OR ARTISTIC TEMPERMENT
FIGURE IN SHOOTING OF ARMY OFFICER?
TC.-Hr*
Lieut. Col. Butler and Sketch of Shooting Drawn From Police Description.
Alpine, Texas, July 25.—Tongues in
army, artistic and social circles albng
the Rio Grande are buzzing like a mil­
lion bees, asking if madness, jealousy
or an outburst of artistic tempera­
ment caused Harry J. Spannell to
shoot and kill his wife and Lieut. Col.
M. C. Butler of the United States reg­
ular army?
The police, fearing mob violence,
removed Spannell to another town
soon after the shooting.
The police charge Spannell was
driving his wife and Col. Butler along
the main residential street, when sud­
denly he stopped the automobile, turn­
ed in his seat, drew an automatic
pistol and a revolver, shot Col. But
der, and then Mrs. Spannell.
Witnesses say, according to the po­
lice, that Mrs. Spannell begged her
husband not to shoot her, but he paid
no heed.

Quiet Private Funeral Services
Held From Home of Noted
Verse Writer
Indianapolis, July 25.—The body of
Dr. Riley, the Hoosier poet, rests to­
night in a flower-lined vaiuit. in the
little old chapel at Crown Hill ceme­
tery, following the private funeral ser­
vices at the home, in Lockerbie street,
this afternoon. A large crowd was at
the cemetery to see the body placed
in the temporary resting place. Dur­
ing the funeral services, all flags in
the city floated at half mast, and ex­
pression of sorrow was heard on. all
sides.
The final resting place of the body
had not been determined tonight, and
no decision may be reached for some
time. Whether it is finally decided to
take the body to Greenfield, Ind., Ri­
ley's boyhood home, or let it remain
here, where friends of the poet have
already started plans to erect a maus­
oleum to receive it, is a question. A
movement also is on foot to maintain
the home in Lockerbie street, made
famous in one of Riley's poems, as a
memorial to the poet.
MILS CME III«
TIME LOSE LIVES
Hagerstown, Md., July 25.—Two wo­
men and one man lost their lives to­
day when the Vivian restaurant, in
South Jonathan street, caved in after
the walls had been weakened by a
cloudburst.
The dead, all of Hagerstown, are:,
Mrs. Vallie Anderson, Mrs. Mary Sum­
mers and S. A. Norton.
t-
Mrs. Spannell was the daughter of
John R. Holland, a banker and cattle­
man of Alpine, and considered one of
the most, beautiful women in Texas.
Butler was recently promoted from
major to lieutenant colonel. He and
his wife lived at the Holland hotel,
which is managed by Spannell. But­
ler was 52 and the son of Major Gen­
eral Mnthew Calvert Butter, U. S. A.,
who was United States senator from
South Carolina.
Spannell was at one time instructor
in music at Baylor college, Waco,
Texas.
Col. Butler and Mrs. Butler were
intimate friends of Spannell and Mrs.
Spannell and often took auto rides
with them. It is on this account and
because of the accredited supposition
that Col. Butler was not guilty of
any wrong that the shooting is shroud­
ed in mystery.

Negotiations for Treaty Between
U. S. and Denmark Pract­

WILL BE BOUGHT
FOR $25,000,000
Washington, July 25.—Only the de­
termination of a few minor details re­
mained to complete negotiations of a
treaty between the United Staes and
Denmark providing for acquisition of
the Danish West Indies by this gov­
ernment. for a purchase price of $25,
000,000. So nearly in agreement are
the two governments, that an official
White House announcement this
morning indicated that the treaty
probably would be signed during the
day. Tonight delay in the closing of
the negotiations was not explained,
but no barrier to their successful out­
come had developed. It was suggest­
ed that the signing might await the
return of Secretary Lansing from his
vacation early in August.
The exact provisions of the agree­
ment are being closely guarded in
the belief that publicity at this time
might place the negotiators at a dis­
advantage. The chief concern seems
to be the possibility that some third
nation might bring pressure to bear to
defeat the project.

which tried to reach the entombed

the deadly gas, are in the morgue,

Will Investigate Cause.
Four investigations—pity, county,
state and federal—will be started to­
morrow to determine the cause of thjfc
gas explosion near the flve-mile crib
end of the tunnel last night, which en­
tombed the twelve men and released
the gas which overcame the two res
cue parties.
The lack of safety devices, such as
gas helmets and pulmotors at the
shore end of the lft,000-foot tunnel
also will be investigated.
The frantic efforts of Gustof C. Van
Dusen, superintendent of water works
construction, and the members of the
two rescue parties, to reach the men
imprisoned by the explosion without
gas helmets or pulmotors resulted in
the increase in the death list..
This afternoon a search rescue
party equipped with the safety devic­
es entered the tunnel and rescued the
rescuers, ten of whom were dead.
Van Dusen was among the rescuers
who were revived. It is claimed by
members of the third rescue p^rty
that the dozen tunnel workers* bodlea
are entombed in seven or -eight feet
of debris and that it will be the work
of at least two days to dig them oat
The federal and city officials, as well
as the members of the thljrd rescue
party, left the crib late this afternoon,
it being decided to abandon work un­
til sometime tomorrow. It is declared
impossible that the twelve men could
be alive. According to the -federal in­
vestigators, the electric wiring is tte
tunnel was faulty.
