BAD WRECK ON
WATERTOWN LINE]
Engineer and Fireman On Pas
senger Train Found Covered
With Goal.
A head on collision occurred last
Friday evening about six thirty o'clock
on the WatertoYro branch of the
Great Northern, half a mile west of
LaBolt, S The trains to collide
were west bound passenger No 1S5,
which connects with the afternoon
passenger at Benson, and eastbound
freight No 330 The accident hap
pened but half a mile from the LaBolt
station, and this probablj prevented a
great loss of life, as had the passen
ger been traveling at full speed, noth
ing could have saved the crew and
passengers.
The freight was endeavoring to
make LaBolt for a meeting point, and
when almost theie, the crew discov
ered the passenger tram leaving .that
place The freight was stopped, and
it is claimed a flagman sent out to
warn the approaching tram of the
danger Neither engineer or fireman
on the passenger were on the lookout,
as there was some trouble with the
giates in the firebox, and both men
were attending to that, so the pres
ence of the flagman was not noticed
Neither did they hear the shrieking of
the whistle on the freight locomotive
In fact it seems the only person,
either passenger or member of the
crew, on the passenger train to hear
the whistle, was the express messen
ger, and he escaped with slight in
juries.
When the engines crashed, the boil
ers were telescoped, and the engines
practically demolished. That neither
of the engineers or firemen were kill
ed seems a miracle. The engine crew
of the passenger were the most ser
iously injured, George Pelton of this
city being badly burned and scalded,
while engineer Clarity of Watertown
was so badl hurt he was taken to a
hospital at that place. Gus Kagel was
the conductor on the passenger and
he was severely shaken up, as were
xthe
mail clerk and brakemtn
The cause of the collision hasn't
been determined yet, as no investiga
tion can be held until engineer Clar
ity and fireman Pelton are able to be
up and around. W. B. MacNees of
this city was the conductor on the
freight. Carelessness more than any
thing else would seem to have beea
the cause, as there does not seem
much excuse for two trains to meet
headon, on a straight stretch of track
In broad daylight.
—A shower was given at the W E
Boyd home last Friday evening, in
honor of Miss Jennie Olson, a bride of
th*s week. The evening was spent in
contests of various kinds, delicious re
freshments being served at a late
hour. The honor guest wasi the re
cipient of many useful and beautiful
gifts.

store for the purpose of the erection
of a wholesale fruit house. That is
all that is public as yet about what
will likely be Willmar's next acquis

ed on the idea.
Nord-Olson.
A pretty home wedding took place
at the J. Markus Olson home in this
city last night, when the daughter,
Miss Jessie Olson, became the bride
of Mr. Axel Nord, a young farmer
from Milbank, S. D. The ceremony
was performed by Rev. Paul Hallin,
pastor of the Swedish Baptist church,
at 8:30 p. m., in the presence of rela
tives of the contracting parties. The
bride was attired in white crepe de
chine and wore a veil and carried a
bouquet of bride's roses and lilies-of
the-valley. The bridesmaids were
Miss Agnes Nord, sister of the groom
and Miss Mary Olson, sister of the
bride. The former wore embroidered
net over pale blue and the latter pale
green crepe de chine. The groom was
attended by his two brothers, Messrs.
Alfred and Oscar Nord. The rooms
were decorated with pink and white
streamers and cut flowers, and the
ceremony was performed under a
large bell of sweet peas. Music was
furnished by an orchestra. A wedding
dinner was served after the ceremony.
Guests from a distance were, Mr. and
Mrs. John Nord, parents of the groom,
Miss Agnes and Messrs. Alfred and
Oscar Nord of Milbank, S. D., and
Miss Lina Olson of St. Paul. The
newlyweds will be at home on the
groom's farm near Milbank after Aug.

Many Willmar friends of the bride ex
tend cordial congratulations.
The Landlord of The New Nevis.
The Tribune received an interesting
letter dated at Nevis, Minn., the other
day from Martin Olson, a pioneer resi
dent of this county who is now in the
hotel business at Nevis. His hotel is
The New Nevis, a practically fire-proof
structure with twenty good rooms.
They cater to outing parties, hunt
ers and fishermen. Nevis has a fine
school, an electric plant, a good band,
and is right up to date. The Olsons
have now been there nearly a year
and like their new home very much.
Kandiyohi folks when out motoring in
northern Minnesota, would find a
hearty welcome at Nevis.

Little Damage to Crops.
Hon. Marcus Johnson is in the city
looking after business interests. He
is optimistic in regard to the small
grain crop. He has examined many
fields in the Red River Valley and
other places where black rust and
blight had been reported as having de
stroyed the grain but actually found
but very little of it. The cooler weath
er of the last few days has helped the
grain in the filling.

The new Willmar telephone direct

separate list.

Willmar Remans OB GireisMa
By iBUBeau AttBadaact
Ringling Brothers* circus last Satur
day drew the largest crowd Willmar
has ever seen. The estimates of the
crowd run from 20,000 to 30,000. There
were about 3,500 autos in town, and
the pennants on the same indicated
that they came from a radius of a
hundred miles or more. Everywhere
you might go in the city you would
see autos parked in the yards and they
lined the streets down town and near
the circus grounds at the south end of
Fifth street The large garages were
packed to the doors. Handy-Lewis
Co., stored 96 cars. Mr. Downs of
Spicer counted 47 cars WiUmar-bound
in the morning which he met on the
one mile stretch from Mud lake east
A lady living on Litchfield avenue E.,
counted 302 autos passing in one hour.
Mayor Wellln's traffic squad were busy
on the congested corners. The May
or put in twenty hours directing
his men and was rewarded by the
knowledge that no accident of any
serious nature took place.
The crush at the main ««itiMmQft in
the afternoon was so great that many
gave up the attempt to get in at that
