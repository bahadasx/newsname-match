report was so romantic and odd thai
?at once the reporter became en
-thusiastic over the fact that in the
next issue of the Sheaf he would
:have a scoop of the greatest news
value- All thru the night did he
iplan on how the story was to be
written and how large a head and
'thevamtfunt of space he would devote
to the item.
Saturday morning came around
with the report still spreading and
becoming more romantic. The re
port had been verified by a party
who had seen them return on the
flyer in the morning and who was
positive that the elopment had al-
ready been pulled off. Then the
"bubble burst and the glorious expec
tations of the cub were shattered
into a thousand pieces. In an inter
view with the supposed to be newly
-wedded young man, the Sheaf re

nothing to the affair except that they
"had gone to Crookston as guides to a
party from Ada, who was not ac

ALVARADO BOY TELLS OF
ARMY LIFE ON THE BORDER
Publisher Sheaf, Warren, Minn-:
Please have my paper addressed to
Co. "K" 1st Inf. Minnesota, Mer
cedes, Texas. This is now our new
camping place- Left Minneapolis on
July 12, arriving here on the 17th.
We traveled in Pullman cars. Our
first stop after we left the cities was
Albert Lea. A large crowd met the
train and the baud played. Retired
at nine and when we woke up, we
were in Missouri, having passed thru
Iowa during the night. We made no
steps there except for coal and water.
From there we passed thru a part of
Kansas and then into Oklahoma
From there into Texas. The first
place the soldiers were let off was
at Dallas, Texas. We marched thru
several of the streets. At San An
tonio we were given what we called
a reception. A lady bought us a
wagon load of watermelons. At the
depot we were served with sand
wiches and iced tea. Post card
views were given to each one. We
also marched thru the streets there.
We had guards at every door, so as
to let no man out. When we hit
Texas, armed guards were placed
there. Even then one of our men
got thru and deserted us, but expect
to get him soon-
You have cool weather compared
to what we have down here. Still
the nights are much cooler than
what you have. A heavy dew falls
every night, so it leaves the clothes
damp. i-,-*,...
We are camped etese to a small
town. It is a low place, so natur
ally we have plenty of bugs, mog
quitos and flies. All we have under
us is our poncho, as ho straw is to
be had around this country".- Our
most dangerous enemies are the
scorpions and rattlesnakes, both are
fatal. The scorpion is a bug that
resembles the crab. About two in
ches long and are of a greenish
color. They crawl only, so are hard
to watch. The water is luke warm,
it being canaled into Mercedes- We
have to carry the. water but work
has been started to pipe it here. To
day we were marched three miles to
an artificial lake for. a bath. But it
was .soTiot coming back that it did
not do much good. We are five
miles from the border. Six miles
fom here the Mexicans are moblizing.
They have had trouble with the
bandits. Some were killed only a
mile from here the day we arrived.
There are between 15,000 and 20,000
soldiers in the camp. It is hard for
us to get information as everything
is supposed to be censored, but our
captain told us last night that in
side of two weeks we would be in
Mexico. We are 39 miles from
Brownsville, where the colored regi
ment was'located- One company was
shot at wMle in bathing so now we
have to have armed guards along
with us.
The people of Eexas are certainly
glad we came stilT the Mexicans lo
cated here are friendly. There will
never be any war with the Mexican
goernment, but it is the bandits we
are after. They get across the line
and raid the ranches and beat it
back. The only way to get them is
to go into Mexico.
I have not the least idea how long
we will de down here.
Yours truly,
John Wr Sands.

mother and a faithful and true wife.
The sympathy of her many friends
and neighbors goes to Mr. Skoglund
and children.
The funeral services were con
ducted at the Mission church by Rev.
Olsoh, who preached an impressive
sermon. Music was rendered by the
church choir. The bier was covered
with beautiful flowers sent by many
friends, who wished to show their
last resects to deceased. Burial took
place at the Greenwood cemetery.
Thus has passed away a true wife
and mother with a beautiful char
acter and who has been held high
in the esteem of her neighbors and
friends.

GIVES SUPERIOR
TEAM CLOSE CHASE
Again the local nine dropped an
other game due to the effective work
of the "jinx". In the Sunday bat
tle with the Superior northern league
club at Grand Forks the Warren
nine played better ball in every de
partment of the game but as ill
luck would have it the honors were
lost by a margin of one score. War
ren landed 1*2 blows to Superior's 10
and made only three errors to their
opponents five. Foster struck out
five men while the best pitcher on
the Superior club, Hewett, could
gather only three. The game was
of the freak variety, in that both
nines took a regular swatfest, Su
perior crossing the home sack five
times in the second frame and War
ren repeating the stunt in the sixth
Outside of these two innings both
clubs were playing air-tight ball
and not until the ninth was the
winning run made by the badger
state town. In the last of the ninth
Warren came back fighting but the
spurt was of no use. With two men
down Gill smashed the sphere for a
two base drive, bringing Wolfe who
walked to first to third. Then the
fans were eagerly waiting to see
what the next man up would do
and to their disappointment he
struck out. Gill for Warren landed
five hits in five times up.

he retired on account of a sore arm
caused by throwing a wet ball. He
was relieved by Foster.
ball playing accounts for the losses
and if the team wants to get in the
running again they must overshadow
these defects.
The first game which was played
Friday afternoon was close and in-
the visiting team. Warren made
mound for the locals and threw a
fair game. Young heaved for Fergus {s
and threw excellent ball.
In the second game played in the I
evening the final score was six and
four with Fergus on top. Halbert
did the twirling for Warren and with
good support would have won the
contest. Jones was in the spotlight
for the visitors and pitched good
ball. Cline's home run in the fourth
featured the game.

Aug. 3 to Monday Aug. 7.
Next week is chautauqua week and
the good people of Warren and .vi-
cinity will have the opportunity of
hearing the country's best lecturers,
musicians, singers and entertainers.
Chautauqua programs are different
from the ordinary traveling organi
zations in that they are well known
for their high class educational and
entertainment features, while the*
other tent shows have the opposite
reputation. Do not confuse a
chautauqua with a circus. They are
about as much alike as a lyceum pro
gram and a coarse vaudeville show
The chautauqua is an American in
stitution and today is recognized as
an important factor in bringing the
people of the rural districts in con
tact with the same forms of enter-*

cities so often have th.Q privelege of
