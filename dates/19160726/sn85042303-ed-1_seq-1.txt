This is a case of where we 'have
heard the Macedonian cry to come
over and help us. There are several
counties in the state where this law
is an absolute necessity. It may be-!
come a necessity with us at any time, i
It is a law that a score of states have, j
and it is not a law that the southern i
states alone have. The Xew England i
states have such a law. It is founded I
upon the principle of protection toj
the home and to the ballot box and
the school, and will not and cannot'
ever be used in any way to injure I
any white voter in the state. It is :
founded upon the principle of peace
among the different races of men. It
is a necessity.
