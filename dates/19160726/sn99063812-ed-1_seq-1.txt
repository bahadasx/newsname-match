to Climb Cowhorn Peak
Although tbc font has been tried
many times, often by experienced
i mountain climbers, the first man to
i climb to the top of ML Thlelson. or
Cowhorn Peak, is State Flab and
Game Warden Charles F. Stone. The
feat was accomplished a few daya ago,
and required six hours from the time
Commissioner Stone left his camp,
nl the base of the peak, until he re
turned. Five other men in Commis
sioner Stone's party attempted to
reach the top, but gave up the ship
long before the Bummlt was attained.
And Commissioner Stone lacked
about twenty feet of reaching the very
apox of Mt. Thlelson. He and Henry
Stout are going back again, probably
this year, and try to reach the top
most point.
"The very apex of Mt. Thlelson is
about largo enough for two mon to
stand without crowding each other
off," said Mr. Stone this morning. "The
Inst twenty-five feet of the peak Is not
more than ten feet In diameter, and Is
smooth except for a few narrowicrev
Ices,. It is our plan when we go again
to drive railroad spikes In these crev
ices, climb up on them as we drive
them, and when we get as far as we
can go this way, to throw a rope over
tjie apex. We will have to throw the
rope about fifteen or twenty feet, and
pull ourselves up by U.
"1 havo boen on nearly every nota
bio peak in tho worexcept those of
the Hlmalyas, and frees nbae Is the
sight so enthralling aa the one from
Mt. Thlelson, even from the point
within twenty feet of the very top,

vada could see Mt. Shasta )and Mt.

Scott, tho Three Sisters, Yamsay and
Mt. Balloy, betides many leaser peaks

"Fish Lake is fifteen miles from ML

position and so difficult was It for me
to maintain my equilibrium that I
didn't take a second glimpse or try to
see the lake with both eyes."
