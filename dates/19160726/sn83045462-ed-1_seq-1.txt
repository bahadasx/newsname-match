First Chief Believes Reconstruction
and Pacification Would Progress
Much Faster Without Them.
MEXICO CITY. July 26.?Oeri. Carranza.
in an interview with the correspondent
of the Associated Press,
discussed the conference to be held
between -the delegates representing j
Mexico and those of the United States!
for the purpose of reaching an ar- |
rangement relative to the withdrawal
of ihe American troops now in Mexico
and patrolling the frontier in such a
manner as to prevent further border
raids. Gen. Carranza also discussed the j
economical, political and military sit-!
uation in Mexico.
"Late papers from the United States," j
said Gen. Carranza, "declare that my
government is threatened on the north
by an army of 15,000 men, led by Villa,,
who is threatening the city of Torreon.
On the south, they say, I am
to be attacked by an army led by re
actionaries and clericals, with plenty;
of money and men. Well, all I can say :
is, let them come and I will knock j
them on the head, singly or united, as
I have done before.
"As a matter of fact, you know perfectly
well that Villa is followed by
a few ill-fed, miserable bandits,. and
the reputed army of the south is a
myth. But, even if these two imaginative
armies have existed in fact, I
have every confidence that my own
soldiers will take care of them, as
they did in the time of Huerta, when
1 started without men and money and
drove the dictator from power. You
may remember, also, that Villa, with
l.is great army, crumbled up and melted
away before our attacks, and any
">fher uprisings will be handled in a
like manner by me.
American Troops Bother Carranza.
"What is bothering us at the present
* r.e is the presence of American troops
n Mexican soil. This is hindering
ir work of reconstruction and pacification,
because it gives encouragement
:o the lawless elements of our population.
It Is to obviate this that the
> ' mingr conference will be held.
I cannot speak in detail of this con:
ence until my government receives
e reply of the United States governif*thaT
sucIj^a meeting he held."
Will this conference be limited 'i?
question of the withdrawal of the
erican troops?" Gen. Carranza was
ed. ,
That is a question that T cannot
wer definitely at this time." replied!
rtrsi cnier. ?ut you can r?e ?.?ed
that the withdrawal of the troops
d the vigilance of the border are the
nts of prime interest for the Mexican
ernment. Whether or not the deletes
will take a wider field in their
'.-.ange of ideas is a matter which
1, perhaps, be decided later."
Guards Along the Border.
"hen asked as to Mexico's proposal
-arding the protection of the border
n. Carranza said that an effective pa' 1
on either side of the line by the
-pective troops of the two countries
ould solve the question of further inrsions,
and that Mexico was ready to ;
.Sow the lead of the United States in so j
tinning men. It is understood that the |
tails of this plan have already been |
awn up and will be presented at the '
reference which is to be held early next
"nth.
Asked about the coming general elec- ;
n. Gen. Carranza said that municipal
ctions would be held throughout the
public on the first Sunday in Septern
r These will be followed by general
!eetions in October to select deputies to I
congress to be held in the city of Quere- !
tro in Decemtx-r or January. This confess
will consider constitutional am' nd- '
tents to meet the aims of the present 1
voiutionary movement.
Gen. Carranza was asked if he would be
candidate for the presidency ;tt the
-ctions following the constitutional con- I
ntion H'- paused before replying, and
' ?n said, smilingly, "I cannot answer
at question at this time, but legally f
-,ve the same right to be a candidate as
v ' v other citizen of Mexico."
No Special Privileges.
'jiifBtione-l resrardinc the reception I
f American capital and enterprises !
uring the period of reconstruction.'
>r.. Oarranza answered that they would J
receive the same welcome as in the j
days before the revolution, with this j
distinction, that whereas in the past
much foreign capita! received special j
privileges not allowed to Mexicans, in j
the present and future all capital will
have an equal opportunity under the
law. Referring to the labor union !
movement, whk-h has grown rapidly of
late throughout Mexico, the first chief
said:
"We will encourage the aspirations
and enthusiasm of the labor party so
long as they work within the law. but
both capital and labor must-understand
that the general welfare is the aim of
the present constitutional party, and j
that the people large are the first i
to be considered."
Gen. Carranza said that he did not
v.ish to consider the question of a;
foreign loan at this time, but that he j
?ould say that 'he economic situation!
of Mexico wap slowly but steadily irr.- j
proving: that the corps this year j
promised to be ymong the bent of the i
last decade, and that altogether condi- j
tions warranted optimism.
"We have enemies." he said, "the reictionaries
and ? lericals in the t'nlted i
States and in this country, who are i
working to destroy us, but we axe
ready fur them." i

DEMOCRATS FEEL
SURE OF VICTORY
I
| Confidence Shown at National
Convention Is Augmented
as Time Goes On.
NOT THOUGHT "MOOSE"
WILL SAVE THE G. 0. P.
President Wilson Will Derive His
Greatest Strength in Preventing
War, Is Belief.
BY N. O. MESSENGEB.
NEW TORK. July 2fi.?That spirit of
confidence which animated the democrats
during- their national convention
at St. L.ouis not only has not abated
tluririg the lapse of weeks, but is aug- !
mented as time goes on and they see
their organization getting into its
j stride for the campaign.
"While something might reasonably
'have been laid to the enthusiasm of the j
[moment at St. I^ouis to inspire their
, hope of victory, it is significant that
I calm reflection and practical survey of |
the field have not served to diminish j
men wuia^e jioi un.ue uicir uuuimsni. i
j
In the past fortnight 1 have talked '
with high and low in party council and j
management and have yet to record a :
faltering note or to encounter a doubt- i
ing* Thomas among them. They believe
Jthat President Wilson will pull the!
party through in .November for the presidential
ticket and that his victory will
save them the Senate, although they
do not delude themselves about the
House of Representatives.
Strength in Preventing War.
Democrats declare their belief that
President Wilson will derive his greatest
strength with people of all parties from
the absolving: of the country from war.
for which they think he will be given
credit. Ttfbv are convinced that progressives
will not return to the republican
fold in sufficient numbers to save
the O. O. P. and are absolutely confident
that their legislative record will appeal
to the thoughtful classes.
They claim that the bulk of the labor
vote will go to the democratic party's
support and they count upon the rural
credits bill winning some of the republican
farmers over to their side. They believe
that the republicans have lost the
power to conjure with the tariff as a
fetich. They have pre-empted the '"lull
dinner pail" as their own trademark, so
long enjoyed by the republicans, and will
claim credit for good business and the
full employment of labor.
They are not dismayed by the republicans'
charge that good times are but
temporary, dependent upon war prosperity.
. insist that -mmmmwmmmf
now, are likely to remain until election
day, ant! that is a good enough Mor- :
gan for this occasion, at least.
They insist that "big business" has !
no just ground of complaint against J
the democratic administration, and
that there is no reason why financial j
and corporation interests should make i
an issue against the democrats and in j
favor of the republicans.
Expect to Win Jewish Vote.
They expect to offset the loss of the I
German vote, which, they allege, is j
largely republican anyhow, with the j
gain of the Jewish vote through the !
recognition of the Jewish race in the j
appointment of Justice Krandeis to the j
Supreme Court. This vote is counted j
upon, especially in New York, to !
counteract the return of the progres- j
sives to the republican party.
Much to the gratification and not a
little to the surprise of the democrats, i
money for the campaign is corning to :
them in round figures. In. 1912. after
the bolt of Roosevelt practically as- j
sured the election of Wilson, the demo- j
crats obtained money easily because i
contributors felt they were not offer- j
ing it in a doubtful cause.
They arc more pleased, therefore,!
that at this time, with ground for belief !
in the minds of some that the fight will
be elos^ contributions should be so;
easy. I was told today by adequate au- i
thority that some handsome offerings!
had been voluntary. This fact also re-';
assures the democrats as to the attitude !
(<f their former friends in big business \
and that it has not changed.
The democrats here have not been I
without actual reports as to conditions!
in the country. Since the adjournment ,
of the postmasters' convention iri Wash- J
ington probably a hundred postmasters .
have brought good tidings of the -.it
nation in their respective localities;!
furthermore, all these men have shown j
themselves to be full of energy aad en- j
thusiasm for the campaign.
Influence of Postmasters.
This fact has brought home to pr.me
of the managers realization of what a
nnu'orfn 1 camtiaifrn /-.V. i r.? ' ? -
? u?5 pnKT- j
mas'frs constitute. In most cases they !
received their appointments for politl- j
eal service rendered and for political!
Influence in their neighborhood. They !
are "handymen" on the spot, able to J
give prompt and effective aid and ad- ]
vice, and as they naturally desire to re- j
tain their offices, will work to their ut- j
most. The postmasters are recognized i
as furnishing not only a very powerful !
first line of defense, but what is more to i
the point, a mobile flying squadron, to]
be deployed int" the field at short no- I
th e. They are always prepared.
I am told one of the big features c '
the democratic political effort will be a
campaign of extensive newspaper advertising
This will cost money, but the
democrats have it. know where to get :
more and realize that it pays to advertise
in politics as well as in business.
They intend to have display advertise- i
rncjits in influential newspapers and to j
use the weekly press'and popular magazines
equally as freely. these "ads" i
will be set forth the record of the party.
Justification of the President and his ad- j
ministration and appeals to the o...
their support. Distribution of speeches i
running Into many millions of copies is !
also planned, but the question of print ]
paper is looming: as a possible, bugaboo
; It is paid that In the present alarming
shortage of print paper and exorbitant
cost, both campaign committees may have ;
to curtail their plans for sending out j
speeches.

Charges That National Guard Is j
Kept Near Mexico for Political
Purposes Is Contradicted.
J
An amendment to the army appro
priation bill by Senator Reed to proI
vide that National Guard and regular
j army men in Mexican service should rej
reive the additional foreign service pay.
j although on duty entirely on the United
I States side of the border, was adopted
! by the Senate today.
j The law provides that men on foreign
: dutv should receive 2b per cent addi
I lionai pay and officers 10 per d'ent.
I Charges by Senator Works of California
that the National Guard was
I-kept on the border for political purI
poses were contradicted by Senator
I Heed, who'declared that the presence
! of the guard had served to awaken
| Mexico to the need of a conciliatory atjtitude
toward the United States, and
that to remove the men now might
open the way to a renewal of marauding
by Mexican bandits.
To Buy College Park Aviation Field.
The Senate today,adopted the amendment
to the armji appropriation bill
providing $300,000 for the purchase by
the government of the aviation field at.
College Park. Md.. to be used for aviation
purposes. This property has been;
leased by the government in the past.
The amendment was offered by Senator I
John Walter Smith of Maryland.
Against Stop-Watch Systems? ^
By a vote of thirteen to thirty-six,
the Senate yesterday retained a House
provision prohibiting installation of
so-called stop watch systems in management
of government works. Senators
Maftine, Reed, and ^others denounced
the system as "brutal and
fiendish." Senator Weeks defended it
and the military affairs committee
sought vainly to have the provision
against it stricken out.
Senator Lee of Maryland, made an
effort to include an appropriation in
the bill to provide for dependent families
of nationai guardsmen in the federal
service, but his amendment was
ruled out on n point of order sustained
by Vice President Marshall.
Council of Defense Favored.
An amendment to establish a council
of national defense for co-ordina
tion of industries and resources in the
tiMi iuM" wfnational security was agreed
to thirty-nine to thirteen. The council
would consist of the Secretaries of
State, War and Navy, the chief of staff
of the army, an officer of the navy not
below the rank of captain, and not more
than six experts in industry, public
utility work or conservation, to be |
named by the President, with the consent
of the Senate. A proposal by
Chairman Chamberlain of the military J
committee for a commission to report j
on the adequacy of the food supplied i
troops at the border was ruled out on a
point of order made by Senator Gallinger.

TRIES TO El HIS LIFE
John Kennel, New York Detective,
Shoots Himself After His ||
Test Fails.
NEW YORK, July 2fi.?John Kennel,
a detective attacnea to tne wire- j
tapping" squad of the police depart- j
ment, attempted suicide today by j "1
shooting himself through the breast in j
the room used by the squad in a down- {
town office building. Kennel was a i
witness in the John Doe inquiry j
which has been investigating charges
that Catholic priests conspired to ob- j C
struct justice during the recent investigation
into charitable Institutions |
and during which the police tapped the
wires to certain clergymen.
Kennel was taken to a hospital In
a critical condition. He was one of
the detectives who "listened in" on j
the telephone wires of Dr. Daniel C. ?
Totter, Mgr. John J. Dunn, Robert W. f
Hebbard and others involved in the t
charges and recorded so-called phonograms
of their conversations. Thurs- ^
day last Kennel was put to a test ji
before Justice dreenbaum, presiding p
at the investigation, as to his proficiency
in recording conversation.
Justice Oreenbaum called the test a
failure, but announced that he would
give Kennel another opportunity to t,
prove his proficiency. lJ
This test was to have been held today
or. tomorrow. The detective had ex- ci
plained that he was nervous when the j
J i I > L Ufa I- v> n inn'ir, ? w 1CI" | fi,
low defectives .vho were with him to- A
day in the wire-tapping room. Kennel 1
was again very nervous, and jumping to;lf
his feet exclaimed: "Oh, the failure of*(.]
this thins? to go through* If it doesn't i
it will drive me mad." He then went j0
behind the partition and a moment ; ^
later shot himself. Ia
The original phonograms taken down I y
by Kennel were used as the basis of the 'j,

Utile paralysis ;
[ is gaining headway
New Cases in New York in Twenty-!
1 Four Hours Are 162, According
to Official Reports.
i
NEW YORK, July 26.?The epidemic
of infantile paralysis continued to gain
headway today. Although yesterday's
high record of deaths was not equaled
there were more cases reported. The
* ; daily bulletin of the health depart^
: ment shows that during the twenty|
four-hour period ending at 10 o'clock this
j morning the plague killed thirty-five
" j children and there were 162 new cases
i reported in the five boroughs of New
i York city.
The plague apparently shifted its center
from Brooklyn to Manhattan, a 1
gradual increase in new cases and j
I deaths being noted there daily, compared
with a decrease in Brooklyn.
Today there were, forty-two new cases j
1 reported in Manhattan, the greatest '
y number yet, arid twelve fatalities.
The most important contribution to
- information about infantile paralysis
made public here today was a stately
ment by Dr. Simon Flexner of the j
Rockefeller Institute, that the disease J
is spread primarily by personal con- i
tact of child with child.
Spread by Personal Contact.
This fact developed at a conference
r of local health authorities, which reri
ceived reports from thirty nurses and
- five physicians engaged in field work.
11 Dr. Flexner said that the work of the
Rockefeller Institute committee, of
- which he is chairman, also "tendtd to
j prove what we had believed, that the
:1 disease is spread by personal contact,
e For instance, a baby may be sick on a
i trolley car and a child sitting next to
11 it may contract the disease."
e The Society for the Prevention of
- Cruelty to Animals announced that
fear of the epidemic had caused a tremendous
increase in calls upon it to
make away with cats and dogs. Since
the 1st of July 73,000 cats and 8,000
dogs have been put to death by the society's
agents. Men sent out by the
1 society pick up on an average 3.700
s animals a day. Last year the society
collected during the first twenty-four
y days of July only 33,000 cats and dogs.
i Thomas F. Freel, superintendent of
n the society, said, however, there was
t, no evidence to show that cats had ever
- been germ 'bearers.

and Bremen.
Opinions differed as to the purpose of
the visit. The most generally accepted
version was that the cruiser comJ
mandcr believed the Deutschland was
J moving down the bay, and hoped that .
by entering American waters he would 1
he able to follow her out to sea, or
j force her to anchor at some point jus*
. inside the capes. Regardless <*f J
| whether the commander had been ableN
to carry out either of these two suggestions,
it is pointed out. visual proof
that the submersible had reached the
lower bay would have proved invalu- i
! able to him and other officers of the
allied patrol.
No Law Violated. j
Much speculation also has been current j
as to what the probable attitude of Washj
ington officials will be toward the visit. '
j Authorities here agree tHat while the
i cruiser violated no law, the entrance was
at least "unusual." The Navy Department
has been fully informed of the
facts by officers of the battleship Louisiana,
who first saw the cruiser inside
the capes. Members of the crew of the
collier Neptune also saw her, but it is
not known if official reports were obtained
from them.
Among residents of cape cities the phase
arousing the most comment is the ease
with which the cruiser reached a point
near Fort Monroe without being seen by
more persons than members of the Loui!
siana and Neptune crews. Agitation for
immediate establishment of coast defenses
and regular naval lookouts nearer
tne capes man fort Monroe nas taken on
renewed vigor. This problem is dealt with
j in part by the fortifications bill recently
| passed by Congress, however. It would
provide for a fort at Cape Henry.
Three U. S. Vessels Head for Capes.
The armored cruiser North Carolina
weighed anchor at Old Point at 1:30 p.m.
and headed for the capes. Two torpedo
boat destroyers preceded the cruiser. Tt
was stated at Old Point that the three ,
Ships were under, orders to lie off the
capes until further instructions.
Arranging to Clear Submarine.
BALTIMORE, July 26.?Arrangements |
to clear the German merchant submarine 1
Deutschland were made late today by
Capt. Paul Koenig, commander of the j
vessel, who. it was said, personally i
would go to the custom house, after reg- j
ular hours, to secure the necessary ,
papers. 1
Respecting a report that the Bremen,
the Deutschland's sister ship, which is
hourly expected in American waters,
would go to Boston, it was said at the
offices of the Deutschland's agents here 1
today that the Bremen would "seek t
shelter at the nearest, safest and most t
convenient port on the Atlantic sea- t
board."
Inclined to Resentment. \
Officials here, besides regarding the *
visit of an unidentified British cruiser <
into the lower Chesapeake at a time
when one German underwater liner is
about to start back to Germany and
another is reported about to arrive as c
very unusual, are inclined to resent ?
such an incursion into American a
waters. There is no doubt that if the o
allied cruisers waiting for the German
submersibles off the Virginia f
capes made it a practice to come with- in
the three-mile limit the question 0
would be taken up officially. v
.So far as is known the incident at
Norfolk is the first since the beginning
of the war in which an allied cruiser j
has come into an American port. Early *
in the war, when British cruisers
hovered too close to New York
watching shipping, the United States
made representations and they were
ordered by their governments to stay
well outside the three-mile limit. ]
Soon afterward the British government
ordered its ships in the Atlantic
patrol not to exercise the privilege of
corning into an American port once in
three months for fuel or supplies, and
directed them to take supplies entirely
from their own bases in Bermuda and
at Halifax.

LONDON, July 26, 11:57 a.m.
?The village of Pozieres has
been completely captured by the
British, according to an official
announcement made today by the
war office.
The text of the statement follows
:
"The whole village of Pozieres
is now in our hands. West of the
village our territorial troops made
r ? *
a iuriner advance and captured'
two strong trenches and a number
of prisoners, including five officers.
Elsewhere on the battle
front there is no change."
Positioi} Is Commanding.
The capture of Pozieres gives the
British troops domination of the highest
point overlooking the plateau on
which the German lines extend to the
eastward.
Some of the most stubborn fighting in
the recent British offensive, which now
has lasted nearly a month, has occurred
in the streets of this village, which the
Germans had fortified until It became
one of the strongest points of their
line.
Won by Hard Fighting.
Every house had to be fought for and
taken separately, and the British after
obtaining possession of a considerable
portion of the village were subjected
to severe counter attacks which they
withstood successfully for several days,
and then in turn again seized the initiative
until the whole place fell before
their onslaught.
The German general staff regarded
he possession of Pozieres of suefcUmportance
that it even brought rein'orcements
from troops which had been
lghting in the Verdun sector, and these
leld tenaciously to part of the village
jntil driven out or captured in the
land-to-hand fighting.
Admitted by Berlin.
