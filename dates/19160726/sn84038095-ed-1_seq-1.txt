Usual Big Audience.
Denison's tenth annual Chautauqua
closed Monday evening after seven
days of the best average standard of
excellence in the series of ten years'
'program presented by the Redpath
Vawter Chautauqua system. We be
lieve that the people of iJenison who
availed themselves of the opportunity
to listen to the many excellent lec
tures and the beautiful musical num
bers feel amply repaid for their attend
ance, their interest in the affairs of
national importance awakened and
realize a greater share of the patriot
ism which must necessarily be felt ny
every citizen of this country if the
highest good is to be accomplished
and the problems before the country
solved. We have heard criticisms from
various sources of the programs pre
sented and the speeches made, but we
believe that the majority of the people
who attended the Chautauqua have
pressed'the
ex­
belief that this year's pro­
gram surpassed those of previous
years. The attendance was hardly up
to standard, but undoubtedly this was

The post office department has re
arranged several of the rural routes
in Crawford county during the past
week and if some of the subscribers of
the Review residing in territory where
the routes have been changed fail to
receive their paper on time this week
they must bo patient. The route out
of Boyer we are told has been discon
tinued, some of the patrons receiving
their mail from the Kiron post office
and others out of Denison. Fred Lyon,
who carries mail on route seven, has
had added to his route two extra miles,
being compelled to go around Section

t.hat one of the bridges in Section 34
is almost impassable at the present
time and with the coming of bad rdadi"
this fall lie doubts whether he will be
able to make his entire route. Farm
ers residing on the rural routes should
make every effort to have the roads
and bridges in the best possible con

carriers may be made as light as pos
sible.

These Wirthmor waists have the habit of always
leaving our store just shortly after their arrival. They
are liked by so many thrifty women and girls who
want their companionship that they are never allowed
to remain with us except for a very brief time. They
are liked for many reasons—but principally because
of their charming simplicity and entire "unlikeness"
to all other popular priced waists.

GREAT BEYOND
Mr. Ed Kuehl Meets Death by Drown
ing in Blue Lake White on An
Outing Last Sunday.
BOTH MEN WERE WELL KNOWN
Robert Hirsch Passed Away at His
Home in Denison on Thursday
From Complication of Diseases
Mr. Henry Kuehl, who lives in the
neighborhood of the ten mile house
between here and Schleswig, received
the sad news Sunday of the death of
his son, Ed Kuehl. which occurred on
Sunday at Blue.Lake, which is near
Moorliead. Mr. Kuehl and his little
son were enjoying an outing at Blue
Lake and were out on the lake ^ith a
row boat, when in some manner the
father fell out of the boat and was
drowned. Friends who were picnick
ing on the shore in the vicinity noticed
the boat with the child floating on the
lake and upon investigation found out
that the father had fallen overboard.
The body was found in the lake, but
not until after life had become ex
tinct.
The deceased is well known in this
locality, having resided here up until
about three years ago when,he moved
with his family to a farm near Moor
head. He leaves besides his father
and mother, a wife and three children.
Funeral services were held at Schles
wig Tuesday afternoon.
The Review joins with the many
friends of the bereaved family in ex
tending sympathy in their hour of sor
row.
Robert Hirsch passed away at 'lis
home in Denison on Thursday. July
20th, at the age of 63 years, 8 months
and 4 days. Mr. Hirsch lias been ail
ing for a number of years, suffering
with bronchal pneumonia, whi.ih to
gether with other complications
brought about his death.
The deceased! was born in Preslow,
Germany, on the 16th day of Novem
ber, 1852. In the year 1879 he was
united in marriage to Mary Katherine
Hansen and to this union six children
were born, four sons and two daugh
ters. All of the children died in their
infancy with the exception of one son,

Do you think there is a store in
Iowa that can make such a remark

pairs of shoes to offer at a clearance

The funeral was held on Saturday
afternoon at 3 o'clock at the family
residence, Rev. Emil Witter, pastor of
the German Methodist Episcopal
church, officiating, after* which inter

The German Odd Fellows assisted with
the services, both at the home and
the cemetery.
DOCTOR'S OFFICE BURGLARIZED
Office of Dr. W. T. Wright Enltered on
Saturday Night and Ransacked
in Search of Dope.
The office of Dr. W. T. Wright, lo
cated upstairs over the Walz Plain
Price variety store, was broken into
late Saturday night, evidently by some
one who was looking for morphine or
some other dream producing drug. The
doctor's cases were gone through *as
well as his medicine cabinet, but the
would-be thief was unable to locate
anything in the drug line to suit his
taste.
Dr. Wright discovered that someone
had entered his office early Sunday
morning. His medicine caee was lying
on the floor in front of the door. Evi
dently the robber opened the door
with a master key as the lock had not
been forced. Mr. E. J. Miller who,
with his wife, lives just across the
hall had slept in the hallway until 1
o'clock that night. He returned to his
room at 1 o'clock and only a few min
utes later his wife heard someone tip
toeing up tlie hallway, but supposing
it was Dr. Wright did not mention the
fact to her husband.
Dr. Wright has not been keeping
morphine in his office for several
months, fearing that it might be stol
en in his absence. Only two months
ago two physicians' offices in Denison*
were broken into and a quantity of
morphine was stolen. The fact that
dope fiends are unable to procure
drugs from the usual sources has
forced many of them to secure them
by breaking into physicians' offices
and drug stores.
C. L. Smith, local manager of the
Green Bay Lumber company, returned
to Denison yesterday from Rochester,
Minn., where he has been for the past
few weeks. Mr. Smith underwent an
operation at the hospital there, having
the ligaments of his legs lengthened
about an inch and a half. He believes
that he lias been greatly benefited by
the operation although it will be nec
essary to wear braces for three months
His many friends will be glad to learn
that the operation was successful.
