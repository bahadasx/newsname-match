SNAKES. I
I
Since the wet weather and since r
the snake story last week of Col.
Sondley, we have heard of others,
which though not as thrilling, still
have merit as snake stories.
Mrs. Stone, who has recently returned
from a delightful visit to her
old home in Virginia, undertook to
have a summer cleaning in honor of 2
her return and when letting down the
porch shade a fine speciman of
"Highland moccasin" came down
with it. The snake was about two
feet long and looked longer. Mrs. a
Stone made enough noise over it to h
attract the neighbors and passersby r
and the snake was killed. Tins nap- c
pened to Mrs. Stone and not to Col. b
Stone. Therefore the snake was c
genuine, and not just "seen." g

Abbeville Man i
Automat^
R. Kirkwood, one of Abbeville's
leading repairing jewelers, has application
well under way in the government
patent office for an automobile
gasoline gauge which bidfc fair
to attract the attention of manufacturers
on a large scale when it is fiaally
placed on the market.
The gauge is a very simple instrument,
consisting only of an "elbow"
and a small valve attached to a pin
in the center of a glass tube. The
"elbow" is attached to the bottom of
the gasoline tank. The gasoline flows
into the "elbow" and snows up immediately
in the glass tube. In case
^ J 1 - 1 1 ?
me glass iuue la uruneii uic ooicu/
valve automatically shuts off the flow
of gasoline.
This instrument will no doubt be
welcomed by thousands of automobile
users who have long felt the necessity
of a reliable gasoline gauge,
especially those who have been stung
by the various invisible apparatus |
ELECTRIC LIGHT
PLANT COMPLETE
FOR RURAL HOMES
Farmer Can Now Have
Electric Lights and
Other Conveniences
! '
Mr. G. C. Fxynn is ^exhibiting an
electric light plant, suitable for a
residence or' a small building, at the
store of R. L. Dargan The plant is
known as the Matthews Automatic
Power and Light Plant. It consists
of a four-cylinder water cooleyi engine,
a General Electric Gettrator,
an automatic switchboard arura storage
battery. The plant will operate
fifty lights all day long, charging the
battery itself when it heeds charging,
and automatically lubricating
i|self. Of-course any Smaller numJaer
o? lights may b^.parriad and for
any lengtfv of time. The plant uperates
exactly as a city plant would
operate in this respect. In addition
to furnishing electric lights; the current
crenerated may be used far oper
ating electric irons, washing machines,
tireless cookers, electric fans,
water pumps, and for any of the
other purposes for which electric
current is commonly used about one's
premises. v
Gasoline is used for generating
the power, a gallon a week being all
that is necessary to keep the plant
going at a farm house. And it is for
the homes in the country and for j
small hotels away from city plants;
that this plant is designed.
The cost of the plant is four hundred
and eighty-five dollars, and in
addition to. this the purchaser would
be required to do the necessary wirrtia
mncli mrmev will hardlv
"?6> ?? ?r - .
buy as much convenience for the
country home in any other way.
Mr. Flynn will be glad for you to
call at Dargan's and have you inspect
the plant and see it in operation.
It is a wonder.
THE MANNING BUTTONS.
The Manning buttons, which were
sent to Abbeville two years ago for
distribution are now in the possession

GOING TO CHARLOTTE.
Dr. Mart Cheatham left this week
for Charlotte, where he goes to work.
His young friends will regret his departure
but wish him all the success

WANTS TO HELP
THE SUFFERERS
Dr. G. A. Neuffer received a telegram
from Governor Manning Saturday
inquiring whethere there were
any sufferers in Abbeville from the
recent flood in the Eastern part of
the state.
ABBEVILLE COl
A few days ago I had a very interesting'
conversation with Mr. Elmore,
who once lived at Maddox
Mill. He heard much of the Saluda
history from the Johnsons, Willsons
and Maddox. He told me the RutIpHce
Ford was one mile below the
Erwin's Mill. This was the old war
road from Virginia to Georgia. The
Maxwell family lived on the west
side of the river where the Johnson
and Maddox lands join. The Maxwells
were killed by the Tories during
the Revolutionary War and are
buried near the old homestead. The
groves were at one time enclosed
with brick. My informant told me j
the last time he was there he could
find no trace of them. The land had
been put in cultivation and had been
plowed over. The clock house or
fort, stood about 300 yard3 from the!
Maxwell house. The first bridge

Invents
I Gasoline Guage
now in use, having their gasoline
tanks run dry several miles fronf a
filling station while the little hand or
arow of the garige would then, as it
did before leawng town, say the
tank contained several gallons of
gasoline when actually it was empty.
Mr. Kirkwood's invention shows to
the drop the amount of gasoline contained
in a tank at all times. The
liquid being visible, there is never
any doubt as \to its accuracy.
Mr. $irkwood is undecided at this
time as to what disposition he will
make of his patent, although he is
thinking seriously of marketing the
gauge himself. However, numerous
offers are coming in from manufacturers
qf automobiles and accessories^
some of which are indeed tempting.
/
Mr. Kirkwood, a resident of Abbeville
4 little more than a year, has
hundreds of friends in the city who
congratulate him in his success and
wish htoi as much more good luck.

Quaint Tradition
Says 40 Days of Rain
The traction is, that upon the
death of St. iSwithin, his body was,
by his request, buried in the churchyard
among the poor, instead of in
his cathedral. Years afterwards, his
admirers proposed to transfer the
remains of the saint to the cathedral,
and deposit them under the high altar,
with solemn ceremonies. This
was to be doneonx the fifteenth day
of July, the day set apart to the
Saint, in the calendar, but he so
strongly disapproved of the proceeding,
that he sent a tremendous rain,
which continued for forty days, uni*1

forty days by the weather on St.
Swithin's day. The Scotch have put
it in the form of a proverb*thus:
"St Swithin's day, if it do rain,
For forty days'it will remain,
St. Swithin's day, and be it fair,
For forty days twill rain na mair."
