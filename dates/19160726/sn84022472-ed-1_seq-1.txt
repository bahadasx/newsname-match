I .The action - was brought , several
months ago and was a protest against
the purchase of the Bridgeport & Dan
' bury line by -the Danbury & Bethel
Co. It was alleged that in January,
: 1910, Leonard T. Saunders of New
r ( London and S. W. C. Jones of Green
I jwlch bought a charter for the' Brldge-
port St Danbury line. They issued
notes for $S20.p00 and with the pro
ceeds bought Danbury & Bethel stock
- until 'they secured control, of .the com-
pany. . ' . .
It is claimed that the; directors then
voted to buy the Bridgeport & Dan
bury line for $802,220.44. Henshaw
-says this was an excessive price ' as
$60,000 was a fair valuation on the
trolley property. He declares the di
rectors have depletsd, wasted an in
jured the assets of the Danbury &
Bethel road until there is a deficit in
the treasury, whereas before the de
fendants assumed . control the road
paid 4 per cent dividends.

short while ago she advertised for a
home where she could board the" child
in order that she could get work. Two
weeks ago she placed "the child with
Mrs. Deane and paid $12.50 for the
first month's board.
- Late yesterday afternoon the ambu
lance was called to 170 Osborne street
where the infant had been found in
the hall way. It was taken to St Vin
cent's hospital by Dr. C. C. Taylor, but
the child was found to-be healthy and

portant contribution to information
about infantile paralysis made public
here today, was a statement by , Dr.
Simon Flexner of the Rockefeller In

marily by- personal contact of child

; This fact developed at a conference
of local health authorities. Dr. Flex

prove what we had believed, that the
disease Is spread by personal contact.

at the i investigation as to his profi
ciency in recording conversation.
Justice Greenbaum called the test a
failure, but afterward announced that
he would give Kennel another oppor
tunity to' prove his proficiency. This
test was to have been held today or
tomorrow. , The detective had ex
plained that he was nervous and ex
cited when the first test was made.'
i According to fellow detectives who
were with him today in the rwh
tapping room, Kennel was again very
nervous and suddenly jumped to his
feet, exclaiming, . "Or, the failure of

not, it will drive, me mad." ,

dead. . . .'
Considerable doubt Is expressed as
to whether Englexbe died naturally
or from electric shock.' If fronv the
latter cause the '. only manner in
which he could hajve come in contact
with the current was from the electric
lighting system, which has : a drop
socket beside the seat on which En
glexbe was sitting. , -No
burns were on his hands or any
other part of the body and this leads
to the'belief that heart trouble miht
nave caused aeatn.
At thetime of the accident, the en
gine was not'running and' the voltage
and amperage' in the drop socket was
very low. . However, the belief is
expressed that he grasped the sock
et arid 4n some manner-touched the
engine so that a complete circuit was
formed and in ' that manner the ,elec-
tridty passed through his body.
The body was taken to the city
morgue and his employers have been
notified. i

OLD ELI TO AID
OF FAMILIES OF
ENLISTED BAND
Yale Alumni Here to Plan
for Welfare of Tenth Mili
tia Bandmen's People
To aid dependent members of. the
families of the Olympic band of
Bridgeport, members of the Tale
alumni of Fairfield county will be
asked to raise a fund. ' Capt. Hiram
Bingham, member of the Tale faculty
and commandant of one of the Tale
batteries npw at Tobyhanna, Pa., has
written to a Tale alumnus here,
praising the band and asking him to
aid in raising: the fund. The matter
was today brought to the attention uf
Judge John Wi Banks, secretary of
the Fairfield County Alumni associa
tion. .
The Olympic band,' how known as
the Tenth Militia Field Artillery band.
is the only Connecticut band now in
the service. Only "a few members of
the bands of - the First and Second
Conn. Infantry would take the Fed
eral oath and in consequence the
bandmen were sent home from the
camp ground at Nlantic. The ; Olym
pic band was mustered into the ser
vice after the artillery Jiad been or-
ideredto Tobylhanna . and will be the
only , mounted militia band in New
Erfgland. ' ,
About 15 members r" the band are
now at Tobyhanna with the Tale bat
teries A, B, and C of New Haven. D
and F of Stamford and E of Branford.
The other musicians in the band are
from Stamford or other cities. y More
musicians are wanted to make uj the
full quota of the band. - ' .
In his letter Capt. .Bingham urges
that members of the Tale alumni
here and in the county at once begin
to raise the fund for the dependents
of the bandmen. At the. time the
bandmen enlisted many of them were
under the impression that 'they would
receive $50 per month, bonus besides
the regular army pay of $24 per
month. An extract 'from Capt. Bing
ham's letter reads as follows: -
"Everyone . realizes the irh-
. portance of a band to a military
organization and the enthusiasm
' which good music brings to the
unfortunate soldiers. We have
eniisted a small band in Bridge
port. The pay Is small and many ;
"of them have families dependent
upon them for support. Our re
