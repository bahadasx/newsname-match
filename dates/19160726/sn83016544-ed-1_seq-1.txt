UHAHfl HARMS, cnOK CII1IHTY, MINN., JULY 26.1916-
Looal Bank Changes Hands
A deal was brought to a head this
week, whereby L. G. Lundquist, of
this village, and his brother, G. F.
Lundquist of Strandberg, S. D.,
take over the management and the
bulk of the stock of the Cook Coun­
ty State Bank.
G. F. Lundquist was formerly
with the First State Bauk of Strand­
berg, S. D., and has had consider­
able banking experience, while L.
G. is well known to the people of
this county, having resided here for
the past three years. He was an of­
ficer of the local bank up to a year
ago.
The capital of the bank will be
increased from $10,000 to $25,000
with a surplus of $2,500, which will
take effect as soon as the articles of
incorporation have been legally
amended, the publication of which
will probably be commenced next
week. This will givo us a bank
with adequate capital to handle the
business of the community, and it is
safe to say that with these men as
managers, it will be run strictly on
business principles.
G. F. Lundquist left last week to
move his family down here and they
are expected in a few days. The
new management will take charge
immediately upon his return.
Rates on Crean Shipments Reduced
Through the efforts of Ed Tofte
& Co. a new tariff iias been issued
by the Booth line, making a rate
of 15 cents a hundred pounds on
shipments of cream, butter and
eggs from Chicago Bay and inter­
mediate points to Duluth, and also
gratuitous return of empty cans
from Duluth to shipping points. This
special rate is a great incentive to
jiii industry which is being de
veI6ped in this county and whicli
will increase rapidly from year to
year.
The first shipment of cream from
Cook county to Duluth was made
about six weeks ago, and the tests
and returns on the shipments that
have been made up to this time have
been very satisfactory and encourag­
ing.
The dairy industry is fast develop­
ing and increasing. The farmers
are wisely raising their stock to
maturity instead of selling it for beef
as heretofore. Land clearing is
also receiving more attention in
preparation for large herds of cattle.
Our development of the farming
industry has been steady and sure,
and it will continue to increase as
the interest and attitude of our
farmers is of the type that means
results, and the establishment of
Cook county as a good, progressive
dairying community.
Determined to die because his
sweetheart had Jilted him. Albert
Krasky of Minneapolis, after firing
five shots into his body without fatal
fesults, calmly reloaded his revolver
and sent a bullet through his brain.
Governor Burnquist has received
word that conditions on the iron
range are quieting down. A letter
from the president of the police com­
mission of Virginia says miners are
returning to work at Virginia and
Eveleth.
An unidentified beneflteiary returned
to the St. Paul Fire a»nd Marine In­
surance company $340 in currency.
The money will be credited to the
conscience fund of the company. The
officers say the money probably was
paid on some dishonest claim.
Fred Sherman, commissioner of im­
migration, is preparing to send ex­

and important county fairs as well.

Comments on the North
Shore Automobile Drive.
'•Speaking of Northern Minneso­
ta Roads you have them all skin­
ned a thousand miles, both on
roads and scenic beauties."
"I was surprised, how did you
finance the road with its steel brid­
ges and large concrete culverts?
This road will be so popular after
it becomes known that garage and
hotel room will be at a premium
soon".
"You sure have some roads."

"If the people of Minnesota knew
of the North Shore Automobile
drive you would have to enlist the
aid ot every residence with'ii spare
room in the village to hold them",
4I had been told of a few bad
stretches in the road from Duluth
to Grand Marais and was looking
for them but failed to find them."
S
In the "Where Shall We Drive
Tomorrow" article of last Saturdays
Duluth Herald was described .the
north shore drive from Duluth to
the Pigeon river and ended by say­
ing: "When the north shore drive
becomes better known it should* be
a favorite with tourists. Minnesota
has nothing like it. In fact there is
nothing quite like it any place in
America, and if the thousands of
tourists who are looking for cool
weather, good roads, and fishing
knew of the beauties of this trip,
there would be a procession of them
along the route. As yet compara­
tively few Duluthians know the
route beyond Beaver bay."
