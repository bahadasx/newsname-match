jectured that he will shortly receive
notification .of the' new order.- ;
The suggestion that ' the U S.
health service examination of vessels
between Pacific coast ports and Ha
waiian ports be abrogated has been
made several times in th e last 'few
years.: Some months ago it "was re
vived at a meeting of the Hawaii Pro
motion Committee. The committee
talked over. the matter and decided to
abide by the recommendations of the
If. S. health service officials here and
the territorial board of .health. Br J.
S. B; Pratt - president of the board;
opposed the lifting of the quarantine
examination plan, on the ground that
every precaution ? to $ safeguard the
health of ; the territory; should be bb
seryed. -.'Dr. Trotter's recommenda
tion was also against -doing away with
the examinations. He opposes the ab
rogation of. these safeguards.-
