Wilson Forces Congress to
Adopt Measure, Despite

President Wilson demonstrated again
his complete dominance of the immo

a spirit' d session last night the Senate
caucus agreed to add child labor legisa
tion to the legislative program for the
present session.
The proposition was fought bitterly by
Southern Senators. led by lardnick. of
Georgia Opposition was based on the
fact that the measure is , onsidered un
constitutional, a matter fer the individ
ual States to consider, ard a bill that
will work great inj r, ', -ouithern in

It was agreed that ihr matter will be
brought up for considerat on immediate
ly after the District of 4-olumbia appro

The insistence of the President on the
enactment of a child labor law is cred
ited to a desire to attracIt Prozremsive

Progressive convention
Hopes of an August 19 adjournmrient
