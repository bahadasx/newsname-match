are said to have gained a position on
both sides of the road in the direc
tion of Bapaume, in a new British at
tack against the Germans on the en
tire front from Pozieres to Guillemont.
The Germans have been putting for
ward their full strength in attempts
to prevent the British forces from
reaching their third line positions.
Fighting of the fiercest character is
in progress.
The fact that General Haig has been
able to resume the offensive so soon
after the unsuccessful German coun
ter-attacks of last week in which very
strong German forces were brought
forward is regarded as a good
agury.

northeastern Mexico has been ordered
to Mexico City and will be succeeded

explantion as to the cause. Army
officers here were plainly surprised
at such an important change at this
time.
General Trevino has personally di
rected the campaign against bandits

because of his efforts that the Car
ranza soldiers have continued heir
operations against Villa and other out
law leaders on such a broad scale. For
that reason some regret over the
transfer was expressed here, though
officials said they were confident that
General Herrera would use every re
source at his command to continue the
campaign.

Manning to the secrce.ary of war and
the president.
No ward has been received at Camp
Styx as to when the guard will e

every nerve to put the First Regi
ment in condition as required by the
new order of the war department.
Gov. Manning sent the following
letter to Newton D. Baker secretary
of war:
"We have now In camp here twc
regiments of infantry and one troor
of cavalry, which have been reported
as ready to go to the border by toe
United States army officers.
"These commands are well officer
ed and have a fine personnel. Both
officers and men are extremely an
sous to see service, and. I write to
urge you to do all in your power to
have these troops go-forward at onca
There is no question in my mind
that they will do creditable service
both for the United States and the
State of South Carolina.
"This State responded promptly tc
the president's call. The troops are
in excellent condition, and are ready
and anxious to go forward. Their
prompt movement to the border wil
serve as a stimulus to the National
Guard of South Carolina, and I am
particularly anxious to encourage this
spirit. Please advise me when they
will move."
Word reached Camp Styx from Co
lumbia that Gov. Manning had sent a
letter to President Wilson and the
war department urging that the two
regiments be sent to the border at an

ttive plans caal fbr the establishment
of stations at Columbia, Florence,
Spartanburg and Greenville. Coast
artillery officers have been summoned
to camp and will be detailed as re
cruiting officers.
The men of the First regiment have
been working hard to get into condi
tion .for moving to the border, and if
there are a few more rough edges to
be ground off it will not matter. be
ause the guardsmen are willing. The
mtter of equipment will of course be
left to the federal officers, and it is
believed that everything possible will
be done to expedite the movement of
th troops.
The men of the Second regiment
are working hard to get in condition
for the much dedired and much talk
ed about trip.
W\hile no announcement has been
made. it is believed that effort is be

ing Information.

sion is gathering information on
which to base an equitable assessment C
of the property of individuals ant

"The tax commission was created i
for the purpose of equalizing the as
sessments on the property of individ- 0
nals and corporations in order that E
all classes o' property might ,bear an }
equal share of the expenses of state
and county ger-nment. In order for I
the tax crmomission to accomplish this t
result it is necessary to secure all the
data and information possible in ref
erence to values and assessments, and
which, when collected and Compiled,
is to be used in equalizing the assess
ments and placing all poperty on an
equality. It is our intention to col
lect and compile this data as :rapidly
as possible for use in taking action
on assessments to be made. It is nec
essary that we secure this informa
tion before our work can be satisfac
torily accomplished. We shall con
tinue our work with only one end in
view, namely, the equal distribution

the people alike. No man should pay
more of his share of the taxes. No
man should be allowed to do less."

ance of civilization in west Central
frica, says Bishop Lambuth, the
[ethodist missionary, are the wild
lephants. They break down fences,
,ample gardens, pull up trees and
wen telegraph poles, for no other ap
arent reason than because they ob
:ct to anything strange in their fa
iliar haunts. One savage monster
early wrecked a small steam launch
elonging to the mission on the upper
aches of the Congo.
The boat, with three white men, in
Luding the bishop, and a crew of five
egroes, had tied up on the edge of
deep forest in a quiet bend of the
iver. A stout plank was laid as gang
ray from the bow to the bank, and the
rew worked until nightfall cutting
nd piling firewood for the boat's fur
,ace; then they came on deck for
heir evening meal. The three white
ten were already at dinher, when a
earful yell from the natives brought
hem out of the cabin to' see a large
lephant viciously attacking the wood
dle. The blacks shouted and threw
nissiles, and two of the more ven
uresome even went asifore with fire.
irands snatched out of the cook stove

aid no attention to them until he had
lemolished the woodpile, when he
whipped one man with his trunk heels

he other bacl into th/boat.
Thundering loudly, with 'red gullet

ng the air, he planted both tre
nendous forefeet on the gangplank.
:t bent until it crecked under his
eight, but held stoutly, although the
whole boat careenad, and seemed
eady' to capsize.
In another moment the elephant had
crossed the plank, and was astride it
with hindfeet on the shore and fore.
eet on the boat. There he stood,
afraid to advance or retreat, a gi
;antic image of baffled rage. In his
fury he began stamping with those
great forefeet, and the boat rocked
:lazily back and forth.
What might have happened if the
nonster had come aboard with all his
trenzied weight can only be imagined;
for the captain by this time had
letched the only rifle on board and,
risking all on one shot, had 'thrust
the muzzle almost into the gaping
mouth and pulled the trigger.
Fortunately, the bullet lodged In the
base of the brain. The elephant
tumbled to his knees and, into the
water next the bank, his u'lk thrust
Ing the boat aside so suddenly that it
snapped the bowlines and sent the
men staggering to the gunwale.
At the next government trading post
the captain had two splendid tusks to
show as the result of his cool daring;
but to his astonishment, he was' ar
rested for shooting the elephant ith
out a license. It was with great diffi
culty that the government official was
convinced that the ~animal had been
shot in, self-defense. Even then he
confiscated the ivory.-Youth's Com

Dressing for the Party.
On the trolley the oth'er day there
were two winsome damsels hanging to
straps and entertaining each other In
sparkling conversation abgut what
they were going to wear at some func
tion that was soon to happen, accord
Ing to a writer in the Ohio State
Journal. They told of their shoes,
their stockings, their lingerie, the
skirts, the bodices, the neckwear,
their hats, their gloves and every item
of their garb and the material thereof,
and their conversation seemed almost
a symphony in velvets, silks, jewels,
that one could imagine them entering
the drawing room in pink, tulle and
ilowered voile, the objects of the ad
miring gaze of all the company.
We would have given a $5 bank
note If we could have caught that con
versation on a dictagraph. By the
way, why don't the record people get
a couple of these fascinating d. ,nsels
together and have them tell what they
are going to wear to a party? It would
be very interesting talk, as one might
imagine, if he had seen that whole
car using their auricles in every sort
of fashion to catch the mellifluous ac
cents of those gentle maidens telling
what they were going to wear.
Snake in Search of Modern Eve.
A decorator at a millinery shop at
Atlantic and Kentucky avenues, At
lantic City, N. J., reached into a draw
er behind the counter while waiting
on a customer. She felt something
grasp her arm, then she fainted.
Coiled around her arm was a snake
six feet long.
The woman shopper screamed and
ran for the street. The clerks and
other patrons followed. The police
arrived on a hurry call, and found the
snake still curled around the girl's
arm. They took it to headquarters.
How the snake got in the store was
solved tonight when members of a
high-school fraternity tried to claim
it. They explained they had two of
the reptiles for initiation. Both es
caped from the fraternity rooms above
the store. The other snake has not
been found.

OFFICER WASTED FW WORDS
Coniveyed Injunction Briefly, but Left
Hearers With a Small Matter
to Ponder Over.
Though the czar packed him away
to the Caucasus and put others in his
place at the head of the Russian levies
sent to stem the tide of German inva
sion, Paris still cherishes its admir -
tion of the tall, grim Grand Duke
Nieholas Nicholalevitch, ,sometime
generalissimo of the armies of Mus
covy. And it is in Paris that they still
tell this story: One evening, when his
forces lay near the Polish frontier, the
grand duke gave orders that all the
persons engaged in purveying supplies
to the soldiers should be assembled
at nine o'clock alongside the track =
where the grand ducal train was
stabled for the night. "I have a high
ly important communication to make
y the Individuals it '"-.ation,' Nich
olas explained.
Promptly at the hozr named the In
vited guests were on hand and stood
in line respectfully waiting. They did
not wait long. In not above a minute
the grand duke stepped out of his car,
facing the trades persons, and looked
them over for several minutes In si
lence. Then he spoke:
"Gentlemen, what I have to say to
you is very serious for you, and is
comprised in exactly three words. 4
not steal-or I'll hang every mother's
son of you."
With that he turned on his heel and
re-entered his car. The audience was
at an end.

New Safety Device.
A clever device to 'insure that not
more than ten men at once shall ride
on the mine cages Is In use at the
colliery of Jermyn & Company at
Rendham. It consists of a turnstile
with four spaces whicbL will revolve
exactly two and a half times In one
direction, thus admitting ten men. The
turnstile revolves on a screw thread&
of which there Is just enough to pe.
mit the two and a half revolutions.
Then the gate to that shaft Is closed,
and that to the adjoining shaft opened
and ten men are., admitted by the
turnstile revolving in the opposite di
rection to the cage In that shaft. The
device stands between the two shafts.
It is the invention of Supt.-John Cor
coran, and has been in use long
enough for a thorough test. The only
way to load more than ten men on
either cage Is for the extra man to
climb over the turnstile or -gate, and,
of course, the headman wll not per
mit that.
* Mrs. Wilson's Lack of Jewelry.
One of the things that Washington
Is noticing about Mrs. Wilson is the
fact that she, the owner of a jewelry
business that has been established for
a century, wears almost no 'jewelry
herself. One really handsome orna
ment seems to be about all she cares
for even on state occasions, and most
frequently she wears none. People
observed, with a grin of rather mall
cious delight, that the president went
to St. Margaret's with Mrs. Wilson
one Sunday. It was the first time, and
downed the rumor that he was too
god a !resbyterian to go inside an
Episcopal church.-Washington Lt.
Iter to Chicago Tribune.
