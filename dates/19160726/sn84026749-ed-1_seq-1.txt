STONE PROMISES SUPPORT
Says Treaty Will Go Through
Senate Without Hitch If It fs
Sent There.
Not only will the Senate ratify
the Danish West Indies purchase,
if the treaty is sent to that body
for ratification, but there are
strong indications the House will
grant the money needed. This is
unofficially said to be $25,000,000.
President Wilson was advised by
Senator Stone, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee, today that the treaty for pur
chase of the Danish 'West Indies
will go through the Senate with
out a hitch.
OBSTACLE REMOVED.
The reported favorable attitude of the
Senate Is considered as removing the
last obstacle to success of negotiations
for acquisition at a purchase price of
$23,000,000 of lslandsvdcemed of the great,
est Strategic' Importance to the United
States.
After his conference with the Presi
dent today 8en'ator ptone said he did
not know just when negotiations with
th6 Danish government for purchase
of the Islands will be concluded, but
other officials said the matter wouTd
be closed within a day or two.
Announcement Was Premature.
Announcement by the White House
yesterday that the treaty would be
signed today was premature? because
the President had not been advised of
a' slight hitch tn some details requir
ing further search."
The'so details,, however, are not of
a nature 'to halt the proceedings now
about concluded "between Denmark and
the United State's.
In the next few days when these
details are adjusted Secretay Lansing
for the United States and Constantln
Brun, the Danish minister, acting for
Denmark, will sign a .treaty trans
ferring the Islands to 'the" United
States. Both officials will return to
Washington from vacations for the
purpose, natmcatlon by both gov

Auto Owners Make Generous Response to Emerg

Good Will Trip for Mothers and Children.
There was a desperate call for relief sent out over the telephone
lines this morning. The petitioners for help were the Associated Char

all ready to go to Camp Good Will.
When forty little folks have been told that they were to have an
outing away from the heat of the city and when twelve mothers have
made everything ready to accompany those little tots for a vjew of
green grass and a breath of fresh, cool air, it would never do to dis
appoint them.
The situation resulted from a misunderstanding of plans for the
owners of eight big touring cars had promised to bring their machines

Following the decision of the Senate,
Democratic caucus last evening to pass
the child labor bill this session, It de

That was the possibility that al
lied patrols off the Virginia capes
would be so zealous to capture the
submarine fhat they would over
step the three-mile limit law.
Mysterious maneuvers of the al
lied guard ships and the contrac
tion of their line furnished basis
for their fear.
And, while Koenig waited upon
the arrival of the sister ship Brem
en, a British tramp anchored
across the path of the Deutschland
and was in position to report his
movements immediately; only a
few hundred feet beyond the
Deutschland, British agents, equip
ped with a fast motor boat were
under orders to trail her down
bay and to flash ashore, word of

In the early mornnlg hours the tug
Tlmmlns, tow for the Deutschland, en
gaged In some strange loading, and
there were numerous conferences
ftbonnl. Several times her lights were
extinguished lest press boat watchers
get a line on what passed within.
There was some doubt that the Ger
man ambassador will come here as
scheduled, to counsel with the Deutsch
land promoters about voluntury Intern
ment or departure.
In any cas he will be consulted by
the managers If the British patrol boats
make any unneutral moves at the capes,

how, motherly German women are say

Stories that the Deutschland was ready
for sailing proved today, to have been
slightly exaggerated, for, aa a matter
of fact, her laundry was only put
aboard this forenoon.
Thero was so much of It that a Chi
