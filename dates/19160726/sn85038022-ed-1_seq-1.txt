Our neighboring town of Dover had
a circus yesterday, one of the old-fash
loned kind where there Is real saw
dust and elephants and monkeys and
pink lemonade and all the Joys of that
amusement. The only kind of circus
Maysvillo gets now is a moving pic
ture of one and those are as widely
advertised as If a real one was hero
But that Dover place Is sure some pro
gressive. They expect to hecome the
county seat this fall with all their new
button factory and the Audubon
Health Resort. And then they will
want a franchise In the Ohio State
League.

First Baseman Coyle of the defunct
Maysville team of the Ohio State

player left, Winnie French, and h

According to the Louisville papers
McOraner will be burling In the big
league next year It not sooner. The
following are some of boosta he re
ceived. :
Under the watchful eye of canny
Connie Mack, manager of the Athlet
ics, Southpaw "Muck" McQraynor, ap
pearing for the first time as a Colonel,
made the Columbus team look like
thirty cents worth of nothing at the
old ball place yesterday. He was a
trifle nervous at the start, but who
wouldn't be after ascending from the
Ohio State League to the major minor!
When warmed up, though, he proved
a Chinese pussle. The score was 6 to

Icnow really would have pitched a
shutout but for passed balls by "Mick
ey" LaLonge, who got back Into the
game yesterday, his hand having heal
ed sufficiently. He allowed six hits
and showed almost perfect control,
walking but one man. Better
watch out, "Mac," or Connie will get
you. Lou8vllle Times.
McOraner, who used to do mound
duty for Maysville In the defunct Ohio
State League, made his debut as a
Colonel yesterday and acquitted him
self with credit. The stocky larboard
twirler held the Columbus crowd to
six scattered hits and one run. A big
washday crowd saw Clymer's athletes
stage their come-back. The hurler Is
OK in the estimation of those wno
watched him toll.
The Columbus outfit afford a poor
test of pitching ability, but McGraner's
performance was impressive. He
showed unusual control for a left-han
der, giving but one base on balls. He
seemed able to put the ball wherever
he wanted to and kept the visitors
hitting them to waiting teammates.
McGaner, the latest pitching recruit,
is unusually steady for a left-handed
pitcher. He has been endowed with
a cool head, which la a desirable asset
for any ballplayer. His performance
against the Columbus club entltlea him
to a berth on the home outfit. Another
thing In hla favor Is that he isn't
afraid to face the opposing pitcher.
His position at the plate Indicates that
he can drive 'em out when he gets his
eyes on the "pill." Courier Journal.
The trial of John Darnell, charged
with grand larceny, will be held In
Police Court today
MONEY STOLEN
By Hmall Colored Roy Front the Mr.
Namer Bakery ea West Second
Street t'ae Tried Before
J edge Hire Yesterday.
Muck McOraner came Into his own
yesterday. He got rid of his wrong
surname and stepped Into his correct
moniker. It had been McGraynor ever
since the sturdy southpaw broke Into
baseball. Perhaps he had never been
asked before how his name was spelled
but It was McOraynor when he was
with the Cincinnati Beds and Montreal
Local writers gave Muck a new start'
yesterday. They got his name right
and expect to write it that way from
now on.
In appreciation McOraner stepped
out on the hurling hill and tossed as
neat a game of ball as one needs In
order to ascend in this league. Mac
will be given every chance to become
a regular, and If he has It In him to
oust somebody off the regular pay roll,
that ousting Is up only to him.
McOraner was blessed with a faculty
supposed to be entirely foreign to left
handers, control. He walked only one
man during the game and was seldom
in the hole on the batter. Louisville

MB. CLARA WAY MciiF.AKY
The caae of llobert Beckett, charged
with stealing money from the McNa
mer Bakery on West Second street
last week was tried before Juvenile
Judge W. H. Rice yesterday after
noon. Young Backett, or "Beck" aa he Is
better known. Is only eight years old
and lives with an old woman by the
name of Manda Barnes. He said that
some boys had told him that the
money In the cash drawer of the Mc
Namer Bakery would be easy to steal
and so he took the first chance and
entered the atore. The first time he
secured about six dollars. The ner.t
day he got nine dollars. The third dav
he was caught by one of the women
employed there behind the counter and
when asked his reason for being there'
he replied that he had dropped a pen
ny and It had rolled behind the coun
ter. In all he secured $15.65.
He told in court yesterday tnat ne
had given the woman with whom he
lives a larger part of the money, but
she denied this but admitted that she
had been told that he had been spend-
I iik a great deal of money up town.
On Sunday afternoon the local of
ficers went to his home but were un
able to capture him. However late
Monday afternoon he was capturca n ;
Officer Throckmorton and taken tot
Jail.
Although he admitted that he stole
the money no disposition could be
mnde of the case. He is too young
to be seut to the State Reform School i
He will probably be sent to some col-'
ored children's home In the State but
that will be decided later. For the
present he was released but Judge
Rice told him to be ready to be called
back Into his court at any time. The
case Is a very peculiar one. He could
hot be whipped as his parents are not
living and no guardian has been ap
pointed for the child. He will have
to be shut up somewhere for If he Is
allowed to run at large he will pro
bably end In the penitentiary.
One of the hargoa that escaped from
the Maysville Coal Co. last week haa
been returned to their float. The oth
er barge was beached near Augusta
where It will probably have to stay
until late autumn, The float was land
ad at the mouth of Lawrence Creek
but could not be returned on account
of the fact that It was In such a wat
er soaked condition. The Itarge that
was returned had the greater part of
Its cargo, It being filled with sand at
the time of its get away.
