Slander
Twas but a breath
And yet a woman's fair n;imo wilted,
Aud friends once warm were cold and
stilted;
And life was worse than death.
One venomed word
That struck its cowarl poison blow
In craven whispers, hushed and low,
And yet the wide world heard.
'Twas but one, whispered one
That muttered lov for very shame
That thing thj slanderer dare not name,
And yet its work was done.
A hint ro slight
And yet so mighty iu its power,
A human soul iu oue short hour
Lies crushed bmiuacli its blight.

chine or pitching on a load he shows as
little fatigue as many a man of half his
years. If there are anv other eighty-six
year olds that can put up a day's work
equal to "I'ncle Lucius" we shall be
pleased to puonsu tue tact.
