selling of bad eggs. An egg that is
called a spot, or has a blood ring, or
mouldy or mould spots, badly shrunk

class and are unfit for food.
The campaign on bad esgs Is to be

the day of education and instructions
for wilful violators was past, and
every lawful and honorable effort will
bo exerted by the department to put a

administered at the bar of justice. The
