The Baraca class of the Baptist

one and cars and wagons conveyed
the crowds out to Yonce pond where
the picnic was to be held. The
morning passed pleasantly with va
rious pastimes and about one o'clock
a regular feast of good things was
served. The afternoon had been
planned for bathing, the waters of
, the pond proving very tempting,
but this came near ending in a
tragedy. The bottom of the pond
has many deep places in it and one
of the young ladies, Miss Bessie
Bean, who could not swim but was
wading came unexpectedly to a
deep place and being a little dis
tance from the rest, help did not
reach her immediately. Mr. Julian
Bland who was on the bank saw her
sink and gave the alarm. The near
est to her were Messrs. Wallace
. Turner and Archie Lewis. Mr. Tur
ner swam quickly to her, but she
was sinking a second time, so he
dived for her and supporting ber
Mr. Lewis lifted her above the wa
ter and she was soon to the banks.

than the shock cf the water.

Forty Acres of Velvet Beans.
During the past few years much
has been written on velvet beans as
a substitute for peas in this section.
Quite a number of farmers have
experimented with them in a small
way but only a few have planted
largely of velvet beans. Last year
Mr. James R. Cantelou, a practical,
observing man and one of our most
successful farmers, planted a small
quantity of velvet beans by way of
experiment. He was so well pleased
with the results obtained that he
purchased five bushels this year,
half of the Chinese variety and
half of the early speckle velvet i
beans, and planted them in a forty
acre field of corn. The beans were
dropped among the 20m when it
was about waist high, one bean at a
place six feet apart in the drill. Mr.
Cantelou has almost a perfect stand,
the distance between the beans be
ing something like ii by 0 feet.
The corn was laid by several weeks
ago and the beans are beginning to
climb the stalks. Where the corn is
not a perfect stand the beans are
more advanced and have almost
covered the ground.
There are several points in favor
of velvet beans as compared with
peas. They are less expensive in
that a peck will plant considerably
more than an acre, while nearly two
bushels of peas are required to the
acre to cover the ground broadcast.
It is chimed also that beans will
store away as much nitrogen in the
soil as peas and will in addition
produce a ranker growth, leaving
more vegetable matter on the
ground. If we remember correctly,
Mr. Cantelou planted the forty
acres of beans among the corn at a
cost ol' about 20 cents per acre. We
hope to visit this field of very fine
corn, the entire 40 acres averaging
weil, in the fall and see for our
selves what the beans have done,
and will then report it through The
Advertiser Jfor the benefit of the
farmers over the county. Thus far
we are decidedly of the opinion that
velvet beans are just THE thing
for our farmers.
Miss Ida Foik"? Entertains.
On last Friday evening Miss Ida
Folk entertained a group of young
people, three tables of rook being
the charming amusement. Tally
cards were given the guests as they
entered so that they might record
Hie amount made.
The evening was greatly enjoyed
as rook is a popuiar game. Delight
ful pineapple cream and cake were
served, after which the. prize was
presented to Miss Gladys Bell. This
consisted of blue stationery. The
guests enjoyed the game and re
luctantly left.
HARDY'S HAPPENINGS.

Rain, Rain, rain, we are having:
lots of it and too much too. It be
gan raining Sunday morning at 5
o'clock and poured until half past
9, then held up a half hour and
started again for the rest of the
day. Monday morning it began at
8 o'clock and is still busy. The farm
ers are very blue. The crops being
young, are growing fast making
weeds and need work and sunshine
U# make fruit.
The Meriwether club barbecue
was largely attended and very much
enjoyed, notwithstanding the rain
and mud. The roads down this way
are badly washed and some very
deep mud which stalled the automo
biles down by the Misses Lanier.
The road through toward Sweet
water and Corryton from the Mar
tintown out by Misses Laniers,
Barker and Bunches is almost im
passable. I think we deserve good
roads as well as in other parts of
the county.
Mrs. George Townes has been
spending some time with her moth
er, Mrs. E. J. Barker. Mr. George
Townes spent Sunday with his moth
er, Mrs. Julia Townee. He returned

Sunbeam Mission Study Meet
ing.
. On Thursday afternoon at four
o'clock several automobiles full of
happy children might have been
seen on their way toa mission study
meeting at the home of Mr. Charles
R. Dobson. The spacious lawn was
a beautiful back ground for the lit
tle children in their many colored
ribbons and white dresses and suits.
There were several trips made by
the three cars bringing in all about
fifty children from their homes.
The children played drop hand
kerchief and other games until a
small shower compelled them to
come up on the roomy porch. Here
the program was carried out, Mrs.
Curran Feltham telling the story of
the lesson consisting of a travel
through the countries of the Orient.
As each country was passed in the
imagination of the children some
child wearing the native costume
came out or perhaps some mission
ary adde:l her experience. Miss
Lois Dobson was dressed as a child
widow of India, Miss Gladys Beil
represented Mrs. Anne Haseltine
Judson of Burma. She wore a cos
tume resembling the one that Anne
wore and looking much like the
noted character. Miss Eleanor Mirna
dressed as a Burmese woman. The
victrola entertained the other guests
during the afternoon.
Again the children romped and
played on the grass until delight
ful peach icecream cones were serv
ed. The afternoon was delightfully
spent and the children heartily en
joyed it.
A Guest.
COUNTY CAMPAIGN.
.First or Series County Campaig
\ Meetings Held at Johnston
: Saturday. Small At
tendance.
The first county campaign mee
ing? arranged by the Deraocrati
executive committee was called t
order by County Chairman B. E
Nicholson in the opera < house a
Johnston Saturdoy morning a
11:30, there being about 100 voter
present. Mr. Nicholson read th
names of all candidates for offic
who have qualified under the rule
of the parcy, and after performin
this official duty he turned th
meering over to the local chairmac
Mr. W. Jjee Coleman.
Pievious to the meeting the can
di dates held a conference and de
ciden upon the order in which the:
wonM speak and also what tim
would be allotted to the candidate
for;?the several offices. It wa
agreed that the candidates for thi
senate were to have 30 minute;
eacsha the candidates for the hous<
20 foinutes and the other candi
date?' who desired to speak lc
minutes.
The first speaker presented b.\
Mr. poleman was Mr. M. P. Wells
a candidate for the State senate.. Ht
stated that the public record ol
every; servant of the people was a
matter of public interest and could
be discussed. He discussed the
Laney-Odom insurance law at some
length, stating that whatever their
intensions were, the legislation''that
gavels the law made a mistake. He
statet?.that if he is elected he will
vote for its repeal and will make it
possible fer insurance companies to
do brassiness in South Carolina.
Mr. Wells favors reducing the
legal'irate of interest to 6 per cent.
He n?xt attacked the tax commis
sion, stating that it was more ex
pensive than the former system and
less satisfactory. He stated that it
h ad dowered the assessed valuation
of property ?140,000 in Edgefield
cor.:J^ This decrease had been
mUt?eTan^ corporations while land
remained the' same. He called at
tention to the lowering of the as.
sessments of the banks while they
were making 25 and 30 per cent
He said the tax commission had
decreased the amount for which
Charleston banks were taxed but
had raised the assessed valuation,
which had been of no real benefit
to the people. Mr. Wells jead a
list of the amount of taxes paid by
the banks of Edgefield county for
1014 and 1915, before and after the
reduction of assessments by the tax
commission, the amount in the ag
gregate for 1915 being about 81,
200 less than 1014. He stated that
during the past 2U years the rate of
increase of property has been about
seven and one-half million dollars a
year, while under the tax commis
sion the iucrease has been only three
and one-half million dollars each
year.
Mr. Wells referred to a measure
introduced by Mr. Nicholson to
amend the law relative to public cot
ton weigher, stating that while a
member of the house he had this
amendment repealed.
Hon. B. E. Nicholson was next
presented and thanked God that he
could say that all of.his acts as a leg
islator have been in accord with his
best judgment and that he had noth
ing to conceal, stating that if the
criticisms of Mr. Wells were for the
public good he was doing his duty,
but if for the purpose of elevating
himself to the senate then his were
unworthy motives. He stated with
emphasis that he would vote to re
tain the tax commission and give
it a chance to work out the tax situa
tion. He gave the figures to show
that by reducing the banks of Edge
field county the commission was
merely equalizing the tax burden.
The banks of Edgefield county had
hitherto been paying on a basis of
(JO per cent, of their capital and
surplus, while the banks of Marl
boro county had been paying only
20 per cent, and banks in Charles
ton had been paving less than 30
per cent. The Edgefield banks
were lowered and the other banks
raised. Concerning the assessments
of corporations in Edgefield coun
ty, Mr. Nicholson read figures ob
tained from the office of the comp
troller general showing that while
the assessments of the banks had
been reduced $44,000 by thc tax
commission other property was
increased by something over ?39,
000, leaving a net loss to the county
of a little more than ?4,000. Mr.
Nicholson gave the figures to show
what increase had been made in the
assessments of banks, cotton mills,
electric plants, fertilizer plants, rail
roads, and other corporations by
the tax commission, all of which
aggregated about ?9,000,000.He said
the expense ^of the board was a
mere bagatelle compared with the
great benefits derived through it.
Mr. Nicholson said the great
need of our people is mo re money
with which to develop our resources.
The banks are unable to supply the
demand. He referred to the excel
lent results from legislation which
he enacted requiring foreign insu
rance companies to make loans
within the State. The coming of
this money into the State will re
sult in farmers being ablt to ob
tain loans from insurance compa
panies at a low rate of interest. He
read a letter from Insurance Com
missioner McMaster commending
him for securing the passage of
the act requiring companies to
make investments and loans in South
Carolina.
Concerning the legal rate of in
terest, Mr. Nicholson showed that
the rate fixed by law only applies
to judgments and other matters of
that character. The contract rate,
the rate charged by individuals and
banks, would not be changed by
the law reducing the legal rate. He
gave the legal and contract rates of
a dozen or more other States to
show that South Carolina was no
higher than a majority of the
States.
As to the Laney-Odom bill, Mr.
Nicholson stated that in his judg
ment some changes should be made
in the law and that if re-elected he
will work to that end, retaining the
good features of the law and elimi
nating the objectionable features.
He expiaiued his connection with
the amendment to the cotton weigh
er's law to which Mr. Wells refer
red, stating that Mr. Wells made
the same mistake, or was guilty of
the same oversight,. with reference,
to the chaingang of the supervisor's
term of office in Edgefield county
from two to four years.
Mr. Nicholson favors the pen
sioning of all veterans and intro
duced a bill making that provision
at the last session. If re-elected he
will press its passage. In refer
ring to the condition of Edgefield
county, Mr. Nicholson stated that
the tax rate for this county will
compare favorably with other coun
ties of the State, being in fact low
er than Union, Anderson, Green
ville, Spartanburg and other wealthy
counties.
Hon. J. Lucas Walker was the
fi rsl candidate to sneak for the
house of representatives. He said
it has been the custom for a number
of years for the candidate at whose
borne a meeting is held to give the
time allotted him to other candi
dates and following that cus
tom he would make only a few re
marks.
After welcoming the candidates
to Johnston Mr. Walker stated that
it is not the members of the house
who do the most speaking who ren
der the greatest service to their
county and State. Some of the lead
ing and most useful members are
those who do their work in a quiet
way in the committee rooms and on
the floor of the house. He thanked
his home poople for their loyal sup
port when he was elected to till the
unexpired term of the lamented J.
P. DeLa ug h te r. T h e i r 1 oy a 1 ty will
encourage him to always do nis
best, always yoting for and support
ing the measures that will bring
the greatest yood to the greatest
number.
Capt. N. G. Evans was the second
speaker. Ile stated that in asking
the suffrage of the people for the
house he was not without experience
as legislator, having served the peo
ple in that capacity ouce before.
He said he had no special acts to
pass and no special hobbies but will
render the best service of which he
is capable. Capt. Evans said, if
elected, he will go to Columbia un
trammeled and will do his full duty,
pledging the best effort of his heart
and hand. The roan who promises
lie will do this or that is promising
too much, for he is only one of
124 men. One member is only 124th
part ul' the body.
Capt. Evans approves of the large

CONDITIONS IN TEXAS*
Rain Needed. Cotton Gives
Promise of Good Yield. Sat
isfactory Prices Expect
ed in Texas.
Dear Advertiser: I will write to
let some of my friends know what
has become of me. Uncle Iv seems
to tbinkl I have either run
away or crawled into an alligator
hole. I am like he is. I am getting
too old to run and to find an alliga
tor hole I would have to go too
near the Mexicans. So I will stay
where I am and if it comes to a
fight or run I believe I could put
up a better fight than a race. I have
seen the time when it was necessary
I could make as good a run as the
best of them. Uncle Iv says he was
seventy-two years old the tenth of
J une. I was seventy two years old
the seventh of last December, but
the discription he gave of himself
I am not as old as be is. I see 3S
well as I ever did after an object
gets three or four feet from me. I
can see the stand pipe at the water
works at Hubbard city with mv
naked eyes and that is twenty miles.
That may be hard to believe but
when any of you see J. C. Morgan
of Parksville ask bim if it is not
so. When he was out here I carried
him to Millford and from Brandon
I showed him the standpipe at
Hubbard 20 miles, the stand pipe
at Frost 10 miles and the Female
college at Milford all from one
point and it was not from a high
hill either. A fellow can see all
around him here and is not hemmed
by trees.
I will try and answer Mr. White.
He wanted me to tell about the
crops. Well, we are beginning to
need rain, the last we had was about
the fifteenth of June.. The corn will
not be as heavy as it would have
been if we could have had rain two
weeks ago but I think it averages
forty-five or fifty bushels to the acre
and some of it may make a little
more. The cotton is doing very
.wolLyet but it will not be very long,
before it will begin to bloom ap
near the top. The ground in the
middles is cracking open now. But
to tell the the truth about the cot
ton you can never tell what it is
going to do. It may look like it
will make a bale to the acre and you
may not get more than a fourth and
then it may look like it will not
make that much and you may make
from three-fourths to a bale it all
depends on the seasons from now
on. One year the boll worms cut
everything off of the stalk and on
the fifteenth of September it would
not average more than two or three
bolls to the stalk and it made three
quarters of a bale by the last of Oc
tober.
The talk out here about the price
of cotton this fall is that it may
go to fifteen or twenty cents a pound
and cotton seed will be worth from
fifty to sixty dollars per ton. Some
were trying some time ago to aver
age cotton at thirteen cents and
seed at fifty dollars. If cotton and
seed get that high from the outlook
now nearly everybody will be riding
in automobiles.
There are now sixteen hundred
and ninety two autos and motor
cycles in this county and they ex
pect another car load in Hillsboro
this week.
There will be two gins in Bran
don, one of them burned down
in February. They are going to re
build and put in four eighty saw
stand or five seventy. The other gin
has ten seventy 'and when the sea
son opens up and the weather is
good they gin from eighty to one
hundred bales a day. Both gins will
be run by electricity and all the lat
est improved machiuery.
