SPLENDID PbFgRAM ARRANGED
And the Public Will Be Afforded
. Fine Series Of Enter
tainments. WORTHY CJEXEROUS PATROXAGE
The people of this community
should rejoice in the fact that this
summer we are to have a Chautau
qua of our own. Many of our cit
izens have during previous summers
Attended Chautauquas In the larger
cities nearby and they are very en
thusiastic over the realization that
this year they can enjoy the same
kind of a program without going
away from home.
The local committee which was
instrumental in bringing the Chau
tauqua to Hartford this year as
sures us that the program will be
of the baine high character as that
provided for the larger Chautau
quas, the only difference being in
the length of the program.
Tlie movement was started some
time ago when a representative of
the Welfare Chautauqua visited our
town and presented the proposition
to a dumber of our public spirited
cltlzens. The opportunity, presented
for affording the people of our com
munity a chance to enjoy the splen
did lectures and musical entertain
ment was one that could not be ov
erlooked and our business and pro
fessional men were practically unan
inious in deciding at once
to put
Hartford-on,lUe-.niaft-wItli other en-
terprislng towns that' provide whole-1
some and Inspiring entertainment of
thls kind for their citizens.
All arrangements have been made,
to assure the event being a success
iu every way and every man, woman '
and child In the community should j
give the movement the support It ,
deserves by talking It to friends,1

Is understood, that a balance sheet

indicated that tlie Rockefeller for-

Rockefeller was unable to dispose of
