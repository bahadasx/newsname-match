The local pastor is especially
thankful to local business men fori

(United l'ress St.iff Correspondent)
LONDON. July 26. Pozieres has
fallen. The brief admission or Brit
ish success from the Teutonic war
office tills afternoon confirmed Gen
eral Hate's earlier comment that the
British had swept the Teutons clear
of the village, where for three days a
Eerce hand-to-hand conllict has raged.
General Haig reported a consolida
tion of the new British position by the
capture of the German trenches west
of the town.
If the British commander-in-chief
follows up this gain in the fashion he
has in previous successes, London ex
pects to sec a double-armed pressure
on German forces in the angles be
tween Thiepval and Pozieres on the
west from Pozieres to 1-ongueval
on the east.
Official dispatches today indicated
that preparations for this step were
under way.
With this important gain in the Flan
ders lighting came also official word
from Petrograd that the Grand Duke
Nicholas' forces had occupied "3r
zingem. The war lias seen no more desper
ate fighting than that which has been
staged in the ejection of the Teutonic
legions from Pozieres. An import
ant point on the main highway toward
Baupaume, it was the objective on the
first great thrust of the British of
fensive. Late last week Australian and New-
Zealand soldiers gained a foothold in
the village. A series of furious Ger
man counter attacks failed to dis
lodge them. Fightinjr desperately to
make barriers to th southeast of the
town tlie British forces stubbornly
repulsed the Teutons and steadily
pushed them back incli by inch.
The rain of machine-gun fire vvas in
cessant save when the detainments
on both sides struck ont from their
barriers and with clubs, rifles, revol
vers and .grenades swayed back and
forth in hand-to-hand conflicts.
Threatened for weeks, the Germans
made places in the houses for their
machine guns, bolstering up their x
sitions with concrete and steel. They
turned a windmill to the northwest
of the town into a fortress, from which
machine guns rendered death-dealing
blows. Near-by was a cemetery, and
among the graves of the dead were
placed modern death-dealing tmple-
njints.
The capture of Pozieres endangers
the German forces at Thiepval. A
retirement from this point is expected.

PETROGRAD July 26. The capture
of Erzingem by forces of the Grand
Duke Nicholas and small successes
against the Teutons defending posi
tions against the Russian advance
northwest o." Baranowitchi. after a
fierce battle, were announced by the
war office this afternoon.
It was also stated that the enemy
had been repulsed after crossing the
Shara.
The capture of Erzingem opens the
way for an advance across Asia minor
towards Angora.
Besides advancing slightly north
west of Baranowitchi against the Austrian-German
forces on the east front
in Europe, Russian forces withstood
successfully efforts which sought to
gain back the first line in the region of
Kcmmerno.
