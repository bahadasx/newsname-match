Administration Is

By Associated Press.
WASHINGTON. July 24.

orous action to prevent injury to

merce blacklist. The president

EVERYTIME HE PREPARES
A CAMPAIGN SLATE,
WILSON OR McADOO
KICKS IT TO PIECES.
Special Correspondence.
NEW YORK, July 19. According
to all available signs, the Democratic
National campaign is on dead center.
The trouble is there, is too much
President Wilson in the game, and
the criticism might be extended, so
the comment of too much McAdoo
also might be added.
Chairman Vance McCormick of the
Democratic Nat i-oi a U Committee
started the campaign here sonic fo'.ir
weeks ago and then proudly annouccd
he had the drop on the Republican
managers, who, at that time, had done
nothing towards getting their cam
paign under way. Hut McCormick
had the drop so hard he has not yet
been able to pick himself up since.
Not only has the Chairman bcc.i
unable as yet to name a Wilson cam
paign committee, but he also was
obliged yesterday to call off the ten
tative arrangements for the official
notification of the President at Shad
ow Lawn, the Long Branch Summer
home of the President, on August 5.
When the notification will be held
and when the campaign committca
will be named now depend on such
inconsistent tcmpcramcntalitics as
those possessed by the President and
by the amusing McAdoo, the latter,
unfortunately for campaign purposes,
being the President's most expensive
son-in-law, as well as Secretary of the
Trcasurv.
As a matter of inside fact, so much
friction has been caused in the at
tempts to lay out a campaign com
mittee tliat Lliairman .iciormicu
is about discouraged with the task.
Under the resolution adopted at St.
Louis on June 16, when the ncv
chairman was elected, Mr. McCor
mick was empowered to name th-:
Wilson campaign committee.
Believing this resolution meant
something like what it 'said, Chair
man McCormick so far has named
about half a dozen campaign commit
tees and each one has contained the
names of enough Progressives to
make it look good to the Hull Moos",
who kicked over the traces when "J".
R. tried to drive them back into the
Republican camp.
Hut no sooner did Chairman Mc
Cormick submit his tentative commit
tee to the man in the White House
than cither he or the aforesaid Wil
liam McAdoo, Secretary of the Treas
ury, insisted on the elimination of so
many names that the committee was
shot to pieces immediately.
Chairman McCormick got back to
the city yesterday after his latest con
ference with the President, but ho
was so hopelessly in the air on the
campaign committee that conversa
tion was useless.
As a matter of fact, the President
has put Chairman McCormick in
much the ianie position that Colonel
Roosevelt put William Locb when the
Colonel was in the White House.
McCormick took his fourth consecu
tive slate for a campaign committee
ocr to Washington with him Fri
day night and the slate was so badly

Prescott late in the day of April 20.
County Attorney P. W. O'Sullivan, in
charge of the prosecution, appeared
so dumfotindcd by this testimony
that, on re-direct examination he ques
tioned the witness to ascertain all of
the facts of the matter, evidently for
his own satisfaction, as Terry's testi
mony was obviously not to the ad
vantage of the prosecution. His ques
tions and Terry's answers follow:
Q. Now, as I understand you, you
have stated that you worked about
four days for Midglcy, the 17th, IStli,
19th and 20th of April, 1916?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. That your brother came out
there previous to the time you quit
went out there on the 18th and 19tl:
and he told you that Yavapai coun
ty here would employ .you as a detec
tive, is that right?
A. Yes, sir.
O. And in response to that state
ment you came in here and went to
work for the county?
A. Yes, sir; he came out and told
me that I could get the job, and left
mc and told me to study it over and
sec whether I wanted it or not and
left it up to mc.
Q. Now, then, when you came in
here or you have stated that some
body told you before you came that
if you went to work that your wages
would begin from the 16th of April.
Who told you that?
A. Well, my brother told mc that.

to be considered subject to only the
