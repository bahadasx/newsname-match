"Phil" Davis, Well Known Here, Writes
Monitor. No Suffering.
Eagle Pass, Texas,
1st Inf.Vt. N. G.,
Attached Sanitary Troops,
July 20, 1916.
Editor Monitor,
Dear Sir :
It occurred to me while reading a re
cent Monitor that people away up in
Vemont might be as pleased to bear
news from Texas, as we are from the
Green Mountain state.
I will speak of camp life of the sol
dier and the country in which we camp.
We are situated about three-fourths
of a mile from the Rio Grande in the
town of Eagle Pass. This town has a
population of about 10,000 of which
three-fourths are Mexicans. There are
many wealthy Mexicans whose houses
are the most richly built of any I have
ever seen. There are many burros but
more Fords. A burro can be bought
for $2 or $3. We have one for a mas
cot. The poorer class would give any
thing for two dollars in American
money. There seem to be only two
classes of Mexicans, the very rich and
the very poor.
Nearly every one speaks Spanish. It
is really another land and another
tongue.
People are very kind to us. I received
a lipe from fraternity brothers in San
Antonio offering me the usa of their
car and a welcome at their home any
time. All the way down here people
were at the station with lunches and
delicacies; baskets full of blackberries
and peaches were given away at many
stations.
Now to come into our imme
diate surroundings. Across the rail
road track almost within speaking dis
tance are the Maryland field hospital
and ambulance corns with the 5th
Maryland Regiment of Infantry.
Beyond them are the 1st and 4th
Maryland regiment and the U. S. 14th
Artillery. Down the track are the 3rd
and 30th Regulars Infantry, also two
troops of cavalry, Signal and Engi
neering corps. Continuing along with
our camp are the 2nd and 4th Kansas
Infantry and band, about 150 soldiers
in all.
We sleep on the ground in blankets
or, if one is lucky enough to find a few
pieces of lumber, he builds his cot up
from the ground to be more sure of
avoiding company during the night.
By company 1 refer to rattlesnakes and
centipedes, lizards and numerous bugs.
Many of these creatures have been
killed in camp.
Our first battallion of Vermont
troops, including Company A of
Rutland, Company B of St. Albans,
Company C of college students from U.
V. M. are scattered on the border for
75 miles, protecting the ranches from
raids. One hospital corps man goes
with each company.
Perhaps some may not understand
theduties of the hospital corps. We
Secretary Hamblet of the Orleans
county fair announces a special feat
ure for fair-goers that will thrill the
crowds, August 22, 23 and 24, at Bar
ton. The feature is a sensational bal
loon and parachute act in which the
performer ascends to a great height
and releases in a parachute which
proves to be one of six which in turn
are released from each other until
from the sixth he makes, a landing.
This is said to be not only one of the
handsomest (each parachute being of
a different color) acts in the ballooning
world but one of the most daring. The
contract for carrying out the act is
very rigid and Mr. Jtiamoiet has no
hesitation in assuring the public that
the event will come off as advertised.
! Every day brings assurances that the
exhibits this season are to be large
and of competitive local county folk.
This always makes a good fair and the
man who does not include the Orleans
County fair in his plans this season
will miss the first and best fair of the
season.

The school trustees announce the com
pletion of the faculty for Barton Acad
emy and Graded School District for the
1916-17 school year which opens Aug.
29. The list of teachers appears to be an
exceptionally strong one and the out
look for a large attendance and an ex
cellent school is very favorable.
F. J. Bates returns as principal.
The vice principal is Sprague W. Dren
nan of Barre, a graduate of Spaulding
high school and Dartmouth college.
Mr. Drennan is a young man peculiar
ly fitted for his work here, being not
only a thorough student but an athlete
of more than usual ability, and will be
able to direct the athletics of the
school with greater efficiency than
usual. Mr. Drennan pitched for his
high school team two years and was
considered one of the best pitchers in
Dartmouth, but owing to his work did
not play much there.
Miss Ferrin returns again and the
other high school assistant is Miss Dor
othy Cook, a teacher who has had
marked success in her work. For two
years she has been teaching in the
North Troy high school where she is
spoken of in the highest terms by pu
pils, parents and school authorities.
Miss Edith D. Ruggles will continue
her work in music in the high school
and the grades and Mrs Heath will
have penmanship as heretofore in the
high school besides her work in the 6th
and 7th grades.
Miss Mary Patrick returns to have
charge of the teacher training class.
Miss Charlotte C. Pierpont, a teacher
with 15 years of experience and a uni
versity graduate will assist Miss Pat
rick with her double-sized training
class, which is required this year of
this school. Miss Pierpont will also
have domestic science and take some
art work. Too much cannot be said
of the training course under Miss Pat
rick and this able assistant. Any de
siring further information about the
course should address members of the
school board or Supt. C. L. Erwin of
Barton.
Miss Crissia B. Renfrew returns to
the 8th and 9th grade room, Mrs.
Heath to the 6th and 7th as mentioned
above, and Mrs. Katherine Jennings
to the 4th and 5th grade room. Mrs.
Daisy Baldwin will have the 2d and 3d
grades and Miss Lucia Holbrook re
turns to the first grade work
Nelson Bartlett Williams of Craf tsbury
. for Senator.
Greensboro Bend, July 24, 1916.
Mr. Editor:
I read with interest the article of
C XT I ino.m T.iItT 19
IX. AM. 1U J UUi I9DUC Ul UUIJ 1
favoring the candidacy of George W.
Russell, of Irasburg for senator from
the south part of Orleans county at
the coming election.
This article stated "There is not a
logical reason why Mr. Russell should
not be a candidate," This may be true,
but I think there are several logical
reasons why the town of Irasburg
should not have the office this year,
and why Craf tsbury, or Nelson B. Wil
liams, should be elected from the south
part of the county.
The constitution of Vermont, Article
23, provides that the senators shall be
apportioned according to the population
at the last census; that is the reason
why Barton, Newport and Derby have
had the office much oftener than other
towns in the county.

Epworth League, 7 o'clock.
The Sunday morning sermon was on
"The Art of Hearing." Have we any
choice as to what we hear ? HaveSweJ
any discretion as to what enters our
life through the ear? No one can en
tirely close his ears so he will hearonly
that which is good and pure, butfour
mental attitude toward the speaker or
the message determines in no small de
gree what we hear and how we hear X.
A beautiful symphony may be a joy
one and simply a distractor to another.
If we believe in God we must believe
that he speaks to the children of men
and we ought to put ourselves in that
mental attitude where when God
speaks we shall hear and understand. 2
The Epworth League is havng charge
of the Sunday evening services l&tyi
o'clock for a few weeks and it needs
your assistance to make these meet
ings as interesting and helpful as pos
sible. The topic Sunday evening will
be "Is it easier to be a Foreign Volun

day by a crew of Standard Oil men

for the purpose.
At the last census, Irasburg had 983
and Craftsbury 1119 population. If
one will examine the history of the
county for the past 50 years, it will
show that the town of Irasburg has had
the office of senatorj five times, Colton
1870-72; I. N. .Cushman 1878; L. H.
Thompson, 1884 ; C. W. Wheeler, 1890 ;
Homer Somers, 1906) while Craftsbury
has been honored only twice, James
Simpson, 1868-69 and Amory Davison,
1892.
In that time Amory Davison of
Craftsbury was given the office of as
sistant judge, in 1907, and he having
died in office, his successor, George W.
Simpson, was appointed from the same
town, fcred M. Sears of Irasburg, of
the firm of Sears and Russell, was
elected assistant judge in 1911, and has
since held the office continuously to the
present time.
At the election in 1914, when Dr. C.
W. Dustan, of Craftsbury, was a can
didate for senator, many of the voters
of the county, felt in all fairness,
Craftsbury was entitled to the office ;
two years have passed and Craftsbury
again unanimously presents the name of
one of her best men, Nelson B. Will
iams. That the town thinks well of him,
look at his record.
Selectman for Craftsbury, 1894-1900-01-02-05-06.
Auditor 1897-98-99-1905-06.
Justice of the peace since 1902, town
treasurer since 1906, represented
Craftsbury in the legislature of Ver
mont in 1910.

nominate and elect Nelson Bartlett
Williams senator from the south part
or the county.
