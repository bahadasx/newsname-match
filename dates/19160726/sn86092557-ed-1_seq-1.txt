An unknown purchaser acting
through Senator R, E. Taibott of Phil

bonds of the bankrupt West "^-rgiara
. company annl today nearly S500.000
won hof ti* $i?4i.'?0 bond issue of
this corporation are owned by the un
fcnown buyer.
The West Tirgmia Company is a de
funct corporation engineered by J. M
1 Gucev which owns 29.090 acres of
coai land in Bartwur county near Phil
llpi- Approximately $125,000 of the
bonds have been owned by the com
pany's creditors in Fairmont, and
1 about $75,000 wonh of these have
been purchased by the mysterious in
vestor. Since the company went into
the hands of a receiver in 1909 ecorts
to liquidate the local holdings have
been made but were never successfuL
j It is the opinion of the local mem
i bers of the creditor"? committee. Glen
F. Barnes and M. A- Fletcher that the
purchase qi a majority of the out
;staadinc bonds by this man. who re
'{nses to divulge bis name, indicates
that immediate d<*veiopment of this,
coal 3e!d m cenremniated. Should;
' ich be the case the value of the re^j
mainmg bonas ;n the creditors hands
will be increased considerably..

THE FIKAL NOMINAIfONS
Secretary Scon Makes An
nouncements Regarding
Races.
The 2nal nomimuions 'or the four
51-uOO stake events 10 be raced at the
Fairmont Fair were announced by
secretary John 5. Scott and fewer of
tlie anginal nominations declared out
than in any year heretofore. The two
slow classes comprising the 2:22 trot
and the 2:20 pace each now contain 15
starters while the 2:10 pace contama
14 and the 2:13 trot has 12 starters
on which the final payment has been
made.
The 3elds in these events are ail
well matched according to the previous
performance of the horse named and
in these races alone the patrons of the
Fairmont Fair will see some of the
best racing ever exhibited on the local
track.
Car: Gosnell withdrew his entry in
the 2:22 trot but will be seen on the
local track behind the bay pacing mare
Hazel Armstrong in the 2:10 pace.
The lowering of the world's record for
the third heat of a race by Gosnell's
famous pacer Single G. at the Grand
Circuit meeting last week, piaces this
driver at the top of the list of pacing
pilots and many of the local talent
have picked this mare to the chief
contender in this race. Another pacer
that will be seen under Gosnell's di
rection on the local track is Hedge
wood Paten en. a sorrell gelding by the
famous Hedgewood 3oy. 2:01rs. This
horse is named in the 2:20 pace.
Following is the complete list of the
entries as they will appear in the pro
gram. that is now being prepared by
the H. L. McCoy advertising company.
