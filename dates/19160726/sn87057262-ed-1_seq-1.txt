LONDON, July 26.—After three
days of desperate hand to hand light
ing, grubbing in mud and crumbled
masonry, the Ansae soldiers of Great
Britain's armies have Anally taken
the whole of the .village of Posieres.
"The whole of Posieres is now in
our bands," General Sir Douglas Haig
reported briefly today. "Westward
the territorials have further ad
vanced, capturing two strong
trenches and a number of prisoners,
including five officers. Elsewhere
there is no ctange."
The war has seen no more desper
ate fighting than that which has re
ulted in the ejection of the Teu
tons from th French village. An
Important point on the main hi
toward Bapsume war'"the fib
of the first great thrust of the Brit*
ish offensive.
Late last week Australian and
New Zealand soldiers gained a foot
hold in the village Itself.' A series
furious German counter attacks
led to dislodge them. Clinging
sperately to makeshift barriers to
the southeast of the town—barriers
for the most part made of the
ruins of the town's houses—the Brit
ish forces stubbornly repulsed their
assailants and steadily pushed them
back almost inch by inch. The rain
of machine gun fire was Incessant,
save when forces on both sides
swarmed out from their barriers and
with clubbed rifles and bayonets
swayed back and. forth in hand to
band grips.

Troops Make aa Good Progress
as Marching Army
in Peace
PETROORAD, July 26.—The Grand
Duke Nicholas and his army have
complete^ nearly oqe-quarter of the
journey to Angora. Russian troops are
forcing tack demoralized Turkish
forces and establishing almost a rec
ord for quick advance. Their rate of
progress has been almost that of a
marching army in peace times. Erzin
gan is about to fall into Russian hands
and apparently' the grand duke's
troops will have little difficulty in
pressing onward.
Angora is the eastern terminus of
the railroad which leads to Constanti
nople. It is the Immediate objective
of the Russian advance. Sivas, about
ISO miles from where the Russian line
now is pressing forward. Is a smaller
railway center, tapping the Black
sea port of Samsun. So far the grand
duke, has made his phenomenal ad
vance without any railroads to aid In
maintaining his supplies.
The capture of Erzlngan clears all
Turks from Armenia and further
opens the way- for advance across
the Asia Minor peninsula toward An
gora and Sivas.
Besides' advwrHStotr
west of Bsranbwlteht against the Aus
tro-Gorman line on the eastern front
in Europe, Russian forces wlthsood
successfully attacks which sought to
bend back the first line in the region
of Kemmerno.' The enemy lost
heavily in these fruitless attempts,
the war office reported.
"In the region of Slonevkl, to the
left of the river, we continue to press
the retreating enemy," the statement
concluded.
Erzlngan Captured.
PETROGRAD, July 26.—Capture of
Erzlngan by forces of the Grand
Duke Nicholas, and small advances
against the Teutonic defenders north
west of Baranowltchi, following a
fierce battle, were announced In the
war office statement today.
It was also stated that the enemy
had been repulsed after crossing the
river phara.

SAN' ANTONIO, Texas, July 26.—
This city passed an unusually quiet
night, despite the fact yesterday was

vided for any disorderliness by in

of the provost guard. Colonel Denni

nois (negro) infantry, detailed seven
sergeants to watch the men from that
unit who had received passes.
No official action has been taken in

A MOTHER

NOT MERELY FOR DRILL
the
Indiana Woman Complained at
Hardships Her Sen Was
Compelled to
Undergo.
WASHINGTON, Juljr 26.—That the
services of the national guard on the
border are "a necessity to the United
States" in "protecting the country,'
and not merely "for the purpose of
drill," was explained today in a let
ter written by President Wilson to
-s. Henry Smith, of Winimac, Ind.
The letter was in reply to one from
Mrs. Smith expressing deep distress
for the hardships her son was com
pelled to undergo as a militiaman. It
follows:
"My Dear Madam: Your letter of
July 23 distresses me a good deal be
cause it shows that you have not been
correctly informed as to the purpose
of having the national guard at the
border. It is not for the purpose of
drill, but the purpose' of protecting
the country. The service the men aro
performing there is an honor to
them and a necessity to the United
States. I cannot believe that the men
In the national guard would wish to oe
excused from it or would lose heart
because of the discomfort and incon
venience of the service. The war de
partment has the camps on the border
under the most careful instruction
and is using every means known to
make them sanitary and safe against
disease. The health of the men on
tlonal guard, is exceptionally good.
"I would not have you think I do
not sympathize with you in the ab
sence of your son, but I beg that you
will take these larger matters into
consideration.
"Sincerely yours,
(Signed) "WOODROW WILSON."

While 'Baltimore Awaits Departure,
'the'
Arrival of the
Bremen.
[By Carl D. Groat, United Press
.Staff Correspondent.]
BALTIMORE. Md., July 26.—Cap
tain Koenig and his crew had one
besetting fear today over success of
the return trip of their sub-sea
freighter Deutschland. That was the
possibility-that allied patrols off the
Virginia Capes would be zealous to
capture the submarine and would
overstep the three mile limit law.
Mysterious maneuvers of allied
guard ships and the contraction of
their line furnished base for their
fear. And while Koenig waited upon
the arrival of the sister ship Bremen,
a British tramp anchored across the
path of the Deutschland, nas in posi
tion to report his movements imme
diately.
Only a few hundred feet beyond
the Deutschland, British agents
equipped with a fast motor boat
were under orders to trail her down
the bay apd to flash ashore word of
her departure immediately.
In the early morning hours the tug
Timmins, tow-boat for the Deutsch
land, engaged in some strange load
ing, and there were numerous con
ferences aboard. Several times her
lights were extinguished lest press
boat watchers get a line on what
passed within.
There was some doubt that the
German ambassador will come here
as scheduled, to consult with the
Deutschland promoters about volun
tary interment or departure.
Awaiting the Bremen.
BOSTON, Mass., July 26.—Early
morning reports from Provincetown
to the quarantine station showed
Massachusetts bay lying calm under
a heavy fog today. No reports or
even rumors have been circulated,
however, as to the' arrival of the
giant submarine Bremen, sister ship
of the Deutschland.
Officials at the quarantine station
on Gallup island declared that if the
super-submarine was ready to enter
Boston harbor it would be hard to
find a better time. Activities of two
tugs and an unusual stir at the North
German Lloyd docks in East Boston,
indicate that "something" is expected.

continuous driving.
Requisitions for winter clothing

Troops.
[By Win. G. Shepherd, United Ptrestf

BIROiWINSVILLE, Texas, July 26.—«
Bigger than any of the average run)
of soldiers I saw In the armies int
Europe are the men of the Third Iowa
regiment, who today are fighting thai
cactus and grease-wood on their*
camp grounds near Brownsville.
They compare In elze and appear*
anoe with the "hand picked" gren
adier guards of the itoyal household!
In London. Put them in the splendid*
uniforms of the Pottsdammer guards'
in Berlin and in physical appearance
they would undoubtedly outshine the
famous organization. One craak Ital
ian regiment' of Tyroleans, the btg
igest men I saw In Europe, Is the
only thing that prevents the state
ment that the Iowans are bigger than
any tnoops in the European conflict.
Forty Iowa cavalrymen aren't com«
ing to Brownsville. They're called^
"slackers" by the troops. When
sought information albout the forty
"slackers," I ran across Captain
Fred S. Hird. He's nobody In partic
ular—only the Iowa rifleman whwi
went to Stockholm, Sweden, in 1912,'
and won the world's Olympic cup.
"You think we've got about the
•biggest soldiers In the world?" he
remarked. "Well, we've got some*
thing else unusual in Iowa. We've
got Quaker cavalry, a whole sjuad
non of them. It's the only layout oj
its kind on earth. There are 280 of
them and they (were organized a
year ago, In the Quaker district ob,
Iowa.
"When the call came for mobilizing!
the cavalry was in a camp right in]
the heart of the Quaker country. The!
wives and sweethearts of the Quakerj
cavalrymen came to the camp ancH
talked peace. There was ndbodyj
•but Quakers around the camp and)
when the time came to take the fed-j
eral oath, lover 170 of the 280 refus
ed to swear In.
"We moved the camp right away t*
another part of the state where tha
Quaker cavalrymen mixed with other
militiamen and got the war spirit
from them. At last we got all butt
forty of the Quakers to take the fed
eral oath and the squadron will be
on the border in a few days."
All Quakers are excused frtm mill
tary service in England, though tha
Quakers have a Red Cross hospital.
Sighing for Notoriety.
OSSTNING, N. Y., July 26.—Dr.
Arthur Warren Wiaite, poisoner of his
wife's parents, now awaiting electro
cution at Sing Sing, sighs for the
publicity he formerly had when his
trial was on. At least that was the
reason Warden Osborne assigned to
day for Waite'B self-inflicted scratches
Sunday. The dentist got a piece of
glass somewhere and Jabbed himself
on the chest, but not very hard. His
"wounds" were so slight that be
wasn't even ordered to the hospital,
Osborne said. He is now toeing
