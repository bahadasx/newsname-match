Early Date.

aged today to steer clear of the prick

Bdward Carson, the unionist leader In
Lister, would be published as soon as
passible and that If there was general
desire on the part of the House the
Premier would oiler facilites for an
other discussion of the homo rule

to over-ride objections from other
quarter.

held today, but Premier Asquith con
terred privately with David Lloyd
George, secretary for war, Arthur J.
