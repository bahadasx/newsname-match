YOU MUST MAKE GOOD!
JMttlgcs Needed on Topeka's One
Thousand Club.
Drspite letters received daily from
penniless wives of soldiers on the bor
der by V. W. Webb, secretary of the
Toreka One Thousand club, dozens of
contributors to the fund have failed
to make fjood their pledges. Mr. Webb
today again appealed to the negligent
contributors to send in their money as
the relief fund is nearly .exhausted.
Kxcerpts from letters written by pen
niless wives follow
"I do not know what we would have
Awiie if it hadn't been for your kind
ness in nendiiiff ub money. There is
no way for the baby and myself to
Jive."
"My husband is one of the guard
and is a member of the Second Infan
try band and while he is away it Mas
left me in needy circumstances. I am
left with a baby 3 months old on my
hands."
Next is a plea from a member of
Buttery A at Eagle Pass for .mother
member of the battery. It follows:
"One of our boys is almost distract
ed over the condition of his family.
J am wondering just where the trou
ble is as my family has received a lit
tle and It was possible for them to eat
far a while, anyway. But this man's
wifo seems to be goins hungry. In
fact, I saw her letter saying she only
had one meal a day of bread and cof
fee, and her children only an egg.
"It does not seem possible that such
is tho case but I will ask that you
make a thorough investigation at
once, as ii her letter she spoke of
tho river."
"These are just a very few of tho
letters we receive," said Mr. Webb.
"Our fund3 are nearly exhausted and
those pledging money must pay or we
will be unable to furnish relief."
Those owing money to the One
Thousand club should send their re
mittances to J. R. Burrow, treasurer.

ALL IN JT MESS"
Irish Situation in Bigger Mud
dle Than Ever Now.
So Hope for Agreement Be
tween Various Factions.
NATIONALISTS DISGUSTED
English Unionists Won't Con
cede to a Compromise.
Lloyd-George Wants to Call
Another Conference.
BY W. OKTOX TEWSOX.
London, July 26. There Is no hope
at Westminster of a resurrection of
the Irish "settlement." Lloyd-George
is believed to be still making some
advances to the various parties to ice
if they will confer again.
Some recalcitrant English Unionists
are rather disconcerted at the catas
trophe they have precipitated and
might be r?ady to lend an ear to any
"snake chamber" but the position is
that the supporters tof the Irish Na
tionalists ir. Ireland are now out of
hand.
Nationalist leaders say that if they
took part in any more futile confer
ences they would be hounded out by
their followers.
The English Unionists, who have
done the mischief, if they really wish
to heal the breaks, would probably
have to offer better terms than orig
inally proposed by Lloyd-George. This,
they will not do.
Want to Know Plans.
At the moment there is little desire
in the house of commons to debate the
late negotiations again, but John Dil
lon has given notice of the following
motion:
"That in view of the announcement
for the government, that they do not
intend to introduce their promised bill
to settle the government of Ireland, it
is vitally necessary and urgent that
the government should immediately
disclosed to the hou3e its plans for the
future government of Ireland during
the continuance or the war.
This is a matter which the house
of commons must presumably discuss
before long, and a day will be asked
tor it.
The next development in the Irish
drama will be on different and un
expected lines.
Ihe advisory committee which sits
as a tribunal to hear the appeals of
the Sinn Fein prisoners have had be
fore them not only those who original
ly appealed, but nearly all the prison
ers.
2,000 Prisoners.
For they. have. been encouraged to
come before the court and state their
case. There are nearly 2,000 of these
prisoners, -. It should be recalled that
Justice Sankey presides over this com
mittee and within the next few days
the inquiry will be concluded. The
committee will make recommenda
tions to the home office as to the way
in which the prisoners will be dealt
with. Cases have been dealt with in
dividually and what treatment will be
recommended is now a matter of
arithmetic.
I understood the recommendation
will be that a certain number
of prisoners be retained In cus
tody. The home secretary certainly
will be advised to release the major
ity or them.
WRITES A MOTHER
President Sympathizes Because
Her Boy's Gone to War.
Urges Soldier's Duty Is Honor
able and Courageous.
Washington. July 26. That the
services of the national guard on the
border are a necessity to the United
States in protecting the country and
not merely "for the purpose of drill,"
was explained today in a letter written
by President Wilson to Mrs. Henry
Smith of Winamac, Ind.
The letter was in reply to one from
Mrs. Smith expressing deep distress
for the hardships her son was com
pelled to undergo as a guardsman. It
follows:
"My Dear Madam: Tour letter of
July 23 distresses me a good deal be
cause it shows that you have not been
correctly informed as to the purpose
of having the national guard at the
border. It is not for the purpose of
drill, but the purppose of protecting
the country. The service the men are
performing there is an honor to them
and a necessity to the United States.
"I cannot believe that the men in
the national guard would wish to be
excused from it. or would lose heart
because of the discomfort and' incon
venience of the service. The war de
partment has the camps on the border
under the most careful instruction
and is using every means known to
make them sanitary and safe against
disease. The health of the men on
the border, both the regulars and
national guard, is exceptionally good.
"I would not have you think I do
not sympathize with you in the ab
sence of your son but I beg that you
will take these large matters into con
sideration. "Sincerely vours,
(Signed.) "WOODrqw WILSON."

Triple Probe of Horror by City,
County and Federal.
Cleveland, Ohio, July 26. Thirty
six hours after an explosion of gas
and an attempted rescue of eleven
workmen trapped in a waterworks
tunnel under the lake had "claimed
over a score of lives, safety lamps ar
rived, permitting the rescue work to
be resumed.
H. H. Rhlnehalt, chief engineer at
Crib No. 5 warned the federal mine
inspector to watch out for more dead
ly gas.
"Hell is liable to break loose In that
hole any time," said Rhinehalt. "En
gines working all night pumped fresh
air into the tunnel, raising the pres
sure to twenty pounds per square
inch."
Ten Died as Heroes.
Ten men gave up their . lives in a
heroic effort to free the entombed
men. A dozen others faced death in a
similar attempt. They went down into
the death hole without helmets and
feverishly worked to revive those
overcome, though pulmotors were
lacking.
Flags flew at half mast today in
honor of the ten men who died trying
to save their fellow men.
Meanwhile, a triple probe federal,
county and municipal was to be held
to try to fix responsibility. The in
vestigations will try to find out why
no precautions were taken against a
possible accident in the tunnel. There
were no safety first devices or first
aid implements.
11 In Tomb Making Total 21.
Cleveland, July 26. Rescue forces
went to waterworks crib No. 5 out
in Lake Erie today in hope of being
able to penetrate the wrecked portion
of the death tunnel where the bodies
of the- unrecovered dead of Monday
night's disaster still remain.
Waterworks officials believe there
are 11 bodies still in the tunnel in
stead of 12 as previously estimated.
Should this prove true the death toll
is 21 Instead of 22.
NEW SYSTEM SUCCESS
Business In One State Office Increases
94,000,000 In 3 Years.
Because of the establishment of a
new system of record keeping, the
business of the state treasurer's office
has in three and a half years been In
creased $4,597,269.86. Receipts have
increased 28 9 per cent and disburse
ments 28.4 per cent. "Much of the
credit for the handling of this extra
work with an increase of one person
in the office force, is due to the sys
tem adopted by Wylie W. Cook, as
sistant treasurer," said Earl Akers,
state treasurer.
"Cook is this year a candidate for
the Republican nomination for state
treasurer, he said, "To Cook must
the credit be given for the big in
crease in tho volume of . business
handled in the department and the
adoption of a system which permits
the cutting out of much of the red
tape of the office Cook's home is in
Kansas City, Kansas. He entered the
treasurer s office at my personal solic
itation and without a political pull.
The job was handed him on a silver
platter.
Details of the new system in the
treasurer's office were developed by
Cook, Akers stated. "Very few of the
records are the same as they were,"
said Akers. "They have been changed
only of course to make them more
complete and efficient records of the
affairs of the department and with the
great end in view all the while to
properly identify each piece of work
carried mrougn its various channels.
Much of the red tape of the depart
ment has been eliminated, Akers stat
ed, and Cook's system of handling the
work has .virtually revolutionized the
work of the entire office. This change
has i-esulted in the handling of four
and a half million dollars worth of
new business each year with the aid
of one extra c'.erk in the office.
"Every known shortcut to effi
ciency and economy to both time and
the endurance of the treasury person
nel, especially in the tremendously
heavy periods of July. August. Janu
ary and February, has been devised and
brought into play in order to keep
abreast with this ever increasing vol
ume," said Akers. "To the ingenuity
of Wylie W. Cook largely belongs the
credit for the creation and establish
ment of these records and systems."

WAITINUN CHIEF
Negotiations With Mexico Held
Up rjy Carranza.
Preliminary Conference With
Ambassador Proves Futile.
Washington, July 2U. Develop
ments in the diplomatic discussions
with the de facto government of Mex
ico have been at a standstill five days,
awaiting a reply from General Car
ranza to suggestion transmitted
through his ambassador designate,
Eliseo Arredondo. This was stated of
ficially at the state department today
in reply to reports from Mexico City
that the Mexican members of the pro
posed commission to seek a solution:
of border difficulties had been se
lected. .
Preliminary conferences between
Acting Secretary Polk and Mr. Arre
dondo have so far failed to produce
any definite result. No decision to
submit disputes to a commission as
proposed in General Carranza's note
of July 11 has been reached and no
reply has been made as yet to that
note. .
It is understood the Washington
government desires that the powers
for the commission be far greater
than General Carranza has proposed.
An informal suggestion to this effect
was forwarded by Arredondo some
days ago, but so far as is known he
has received no reply. The delay of
the de facto government is making
known its views on the new sugges
tions and the fact that inaccurate
statements as to the status of negotia
tions have been made in Mexico City
inclined some officials here today to
believe that some obstacle had been
encountered in the efforts to decide
upon the scope of the proposed com
mission's discussion.
PRICES GO HIGHER
Hogs, Cattle and Sheep Show
Fiye Per Cent Rise.
Fork Jumped 20 Cents During
Last Month.
Washington, July 26. Prices paid
for hogs, cattle, sheep and chickens
during the month from June 15 to
July 15 were about 5 per cent higher
than usual, the agricultural depart
ment announced today.
Hog prices increased 20 cents per
100 pounds in this period, averaging
$8.40 per 100 pounds on July 15. This
is higher than any month since June,
1910. A year ago the average was
$6.85. The average range on July 15
for the preceding five years was
$7.25.
Beef cattle declined 13 cents per
nunareo. pouncs in tne past month and
on July 15 averaged iU.78, compared
with $6.07 a year ago and $5. S3, which
was the average on July 15 for five
preceding years. Sheep prices de
clined 21 cents per hundred pounds
during the month, but prices still are
high, averaging $6.33 per hundred
pounds, compared with $5.35 a year
ago and $4.48 for the five year aver
age. Milk cows prices advanced each
month this year, the past month ex
periencing an increase of 41 cents per
head. The average per head on July
15 was $62.04, compared with $60.31
a year ago and $49.02 as the five year
average. Hog prices increased about
63 cents a head during the month
ending July 125, but they- have de
clined during recent years.
ON BURGLARYCHARGE
Huckster Suspected of Robbing Pax
ton Store.
William O'Hara was arrested today
by the police in connection with the
burglary at the Paxton store Sunday.
Later a complaint was sworn to by a
private detective charging him with
the crime. The county attorney stated
that a warrant would be issued for
O'Hara some time today.
The charge against O'Hara is that
of breaking into the Paxton store and
carrying away ten suits of men's
clothing valued at $15 each, and one
silk dress valued at $8. O'Hara has
been in Topeka about six months and
has been working off and on as a
huckster.
A woman saw a man leaving the
rear of the Paxton store Sunday carry
ing two suit cases. She looked O'Hara
over today and coclared he "looked
like the same man."

WANT GUARDS OUT
1,500 Discharge Applications a
Week Receiyed by Funston.
But More Come From Relatives
Than From Soldiers.
San Antonio, Tex. July 26,- Appli
cations for release from service of
guardsmen with persons dependent
upon them now are pouring into army
headquarters- at Fort Sam Houston at
the rate of 1,500 a week, it was an
nounced today. Several hundred al
ready have been released.
The vast majority of the applica
tions do not come from the guardsmen
themselves but from wives, mothers
and sisters to congressmen interested
in their cases. In each case an inves
tigation must be made with the result
that headquarters has an immense
amount of additional clerical work to
perform. Twenty-five releases were
signed this morning.
Military authorities say that because
of the release of the guardsmen with
dependents, and the prospect that
many other guardsmen will be freed
from service so that they may return
to college, the military situation in
one respect soon will be greatly
changed. When the movement of the
national guardsmen began, they say,.
there were many men without equip
ment whereas the future will
see
much equipment
utilize it.

DISCUSSED BLACKLIST
British Officials Think Move- Not Seri
ous to American Interests.
Washington, July 26. Ambassador
state' department 'of an informal dis-
cussion he had at the British foreign
office regarding the British black list
of American firms. Department of-
fioials indicated that the scope and ef-
! feet of the black list order was gone
over in detail at the conference and
the ambassador learned that the
British authorities hold that the order
will not affect American interests so
seriously as is believed here.
The United States government of
ficially stated it is not yet in a posi
tion to proceed directly and formally
in negotiations with Great Britain.
At the state department it is de
clared that some of the Amercan firms
on the list are free from the least sus
picion of German commercial or other
connections.
Mr. Polk said today the department
had taken up with the British em-
bassv seven or eight individual cases
of American firms black listed. The
British government will make a de-
tailed explanation of the purposes and
extent of its commercial black list in
the house of commons in a day or two,
it was officially announced at the
British embassy today.

Famous Matters Case Before

Chicago, July 26. The famous
Matters baby, who has cooed, gurgled
flnd played with her toe? through two
court trials already, was the cen -al
i figure in another court proceedii be
fore Federal Judge Landis here today.
"Margaret Bryan," who swore in court
that the baby girl is hers because she
was the unwed war bride of the vil
lage blacksmith of her Canadian
home town, appeared to plead with
the judge to let her have the tiny
mite. The rich Mrs. Annie Dollle
Ledgerwood Matters also claims to be
the mother of the baby.
Mrs. Matters, charged with foisting
the baby on her husband's estate as a
spurious heir, Is to go to trial again

jury in connection with probate court
records in the case. She was acquit
ted, several months ago, of the direct
charge of foisting the child on the
Matters' estate.
A Plot for Maupaussant.
The Matters baby case, to date has
unfolded a story that would furnish
a de Maupaussant with plots for a
dozen novels. It began when Decem

Matters, Areola, 111., moving picture
magnate, a man nearing 70, married
Anna Dollie Ledgerwood, a woman
of 20.
And then Matters died, leaving a

death, Mrs. Matters appeared with a
baby. It was hers, she said, bom to
her at Misercordia hospital, at Ottawa.

questioned her claim of a posthumous
heir. Ir. the first place, they said, pa
renthood was a physical impossibility
to Matters.
Physicians came from the hospital
and testified for Mrs. Matters. It was
her baby, they .said. Then, months

ters's at all. , It was born to, Margaret
Bryan, a young Canadian , girl, who
had surrendered to love when tne vil
lage blacksmith in her town went
away to war with the Canadian con
tingent. The baby was taken from
Margaret at its birth, Doctor Bc-rcard
said, and taken to a room where Mrs.
Matters lay. Margaret was . told her
baby had died at birth. She lay list
lessly and sadly in her cot in the pub
lic ward, while Mrs. Matters. ' known
to the "poor ward" as the "millionaire
lady," crooned over the child.
Doctor Bercard detailed the surgical
precautions that had ' been taken to
make it appear Mrs. Matters was the
mother.
Girl Told Her Story.
When the trial of Mrs. Matters on
a criminal charge began, the state
sprang a surprise. It brought Mar-
garet Bryan to Chicago, and the pretty
i uanaaian gin tola tne jury ner story.
But it did not convict Mrs. Matters.
Then Margaret went to Federal
Judge Landis, and told him she want
ed her baby. A federal statute pro
hibits "immigration" of a child with
out consent of its parents. If Margaret
was the real mother, the law applied
to the Matters baby. So Judge Landis
ordered the child taken from Mrs.
Matters, placed In a local Institution,
and visiting hours so arranged that
Margaret could see it each morning
and Mrs. Matters each afternoon.
There the case rested when Mrs. Mat-
i ters went to trial again today.
