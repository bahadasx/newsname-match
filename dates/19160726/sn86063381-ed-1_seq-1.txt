22 DEAD AS RESULT
OFGASEXPLOSIONIN
WATERWORKSTUNNEL Cleveland, July 26.Federal offi
cials investigating the waterworks
tunnel disaster which cost 22 lives,
late yesterday afternoon ordered all
attempts to reach the bodies of 12
men imprisoned in the tunnel, aban
doned until late today.
This action was taken because
tests of the gas in the tunnel through
which the rescuers had to pass
showed that it is highly explosive and
the officials feared a second explo
sion. An attempt will be made to
pump out the gas so that the work
of rescuing the bodies may progress
All hope that any of the 12 men
trapped in the tunnel are alive has
been abandoned. Ten bodies, those
of members of rescue bodies which
tried to reach the doomed men, but
themselves succombed to the deadly
gas, are in the morgue. The eighfH*
men injured, also members of the
rescue party, will recover
Four investigations, city, county,
state and federal, were started today
to determine the cause of the gas ex
plosion near the five-mile crib end
of the tunnel Monday night which
entombed the 12 men and released the
gas which overcame the two rescue
parties.

DR. WAITE ATTEMPTS
TO COMMIT SUICIDE
Sing Sing Prison, N. Y., July 26.
Dr. Arthur Warren Waite, awaiting
execution for the murder of his.fath
er-in-law, John E. Peck, of Grand
Rapids, Mich., was found in his cell
in the "death house" last night
bleeding from a wound in his chest,
made in the shape of a eross. The
prisoner had cut himself with a piece
of broken glass.
How Waite obtained possession of
the glass could not be explained. It
is presumed that when he was taken
out for exercise in the court yard he
picked it up when the vigilance of his
guard was relaxed, and concealed it
until he returned to his cell.
Waite was removed to the prison
hospital, but he steadfastly refused to
answer questions. The injury is not
serious. JUNIOR COMMERCIAL

CAPTURE ENGANGERS GERMANS
FROM THIEPVAL TO POCIERES
Encircling Movement is Endangering

is Evacuated.
(By United Press) '-.$
London, July 26.After three days
of desperate hand to hand fighting
the British Australian-New Zealand
troops have taken all of the village
of Pozieres.
General Haig is today quoted as
stating that the whole of Pozieres
is now in the British hands. The
British statement also says "west
ward our territorials have further ad
vanced, capturing two strong
trenches, a number of officers and
other prisoners. Elsewhere there is
no change."
Desperate Fighting.
The war has seen no more desper
ate fighting than at Pozieres. The
town is an important point on the
main highway toward Baupame,
which was the objective of the first
great thrust. Late last week the
colonials gained a foothold in the
village itself. A series of furious
German counter attacks failed to dis
lodge them. The capture of the
whole town endangers the German
forces in Salient from Thiepval to
Pozieres. Further advance reported
by General Haig indicates that an en
circling movement is menacing the
enemy line.
Erzingan Evacuated.
London, July 26.A Rome wire
less press report says that the Turks
have evacuated Erzingan in face of
the drive by Grand Duke Nicholas.
Berlin, July 26.Ambassador Ger
ard has delivered to the foreigD .office
President Wilson's Polish relief ap
peal. The message was immediately
telegraphed to the emperor who is on
the eastern front.
Admit Defeat.
Berlin, July 26.The German offi
cial statement today admits that "af-
ter a stubborn fight the British have
established themselves in Pozieres."
Advance One-third of Way.
Petrograd, July 26.It was offi
cially announced today that Erzingan
has been captured by Grand Duke
Nicholas' armies. This clears Arme
nia of Turks and means that the Rus
sians have advanced one-third of the
way to Angora, the head of the rail
way to Constantinople and the im
mediate objective of the Russian
army now. Erzingan victory is a
great feat.
