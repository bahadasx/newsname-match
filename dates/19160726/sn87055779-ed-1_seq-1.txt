Information About Extent
of British Boycott and

International Nmv Srvii-c;
WASHINGTON, July 2... Thro
distinct inquiries into the g neral
assault planned upon American
trade ly the Kuropean I -1 1 i jt -rents,
were being pressed today.
The state department was coin
I letintf its information . regarding
the extent of the Pritish boycott and
the manner of its planned enforce
ment. It alo was examining treaty
applications and preparing its con
tention that the domicile of a cor
j oration instead of where its stock
is controlled, l.s Its home.
The senate foreign relations com
mittee was inquiring broadly into
the British blacklist, the agreement
leached at the recent entente con
ference in Paris, a reported com
mercial agreement of tht Teutonic
powers and the Russo-Japanese al
liance in the far east. The white,
bouse was investicatinff all of the
boycott facts preparatory to cooper
ating with the täte department in
a general protest.
Situation Coin plica tt I.
The international situation. In
stead of clearing, was becoming
more and more complicated. Offic
ials realize fully that upon the ac
tion to be taken by the administra
tion may hinge Oerniany's adher
ence to the promises previously made
in the submarine situation.
It Is
well known here that German agents
havv. charted that this government
has recently permitted Great Prlt
ain and her allies to force certain
changes in Us International policy.
The advocates of a return to unre
stricted y'lbma. ne warfare in Ger
n.tip.r nre iiffng thl as an argument
lor their suggestion in Germany and
as proof that the I'nited States ha
one policy for Germany and another
lor her enemies.
All the confidential information
reaching here from Germany is to
the effect that these arguments ;irrt
havii.g a strong eitert on that sec
tion of the German press which
heretofore has been adv orating re
taining friendly relations with the
United States and it is pointed out
that wluther there shall be a com
plete change in sentiment through
out Germany will largely depend
upon what the United States does in
handling the Pruti-h boycott.
Will Deny Right.
It is admitted in otficial circles
that this government realizes the
seriousness of the situation now con
fronting it. The proposed protest
which Is to lie sent forward will
make this government's position
plain. It will i'.atly contradict the
right of (Treat Britain, or any other
i.atlon, to intefere with the internal
.ffalrs of the United States or to any
way obstruct the dealings of in
Mli.jects so long as they are not deal
ing In articles that are of absolute
contraband of war with a belliger
ent power.
The riht to trade freely and fully
with South America, with the Ku
ropean neutrals or In the tar east
will be emphatically deft nded.
(Tiant lYom Plan.
That Great Britain already has
n ateriaily receded from her orig
inal plan was the construction placed
ty ot'.'ei.ils upon the declaration of
Sir Cecil Spring-Rice that "con
1 1. lets already in eifevt will not be
unpaired ' under the bocott order.
It is hoped here th.it when the exact
position of the Unit .1 States is made
k:. vn to the British foteii:ti ottice
additional material concessions will
i. e made.

l!rish Party Meets
To Discuss Policy
To be Pursued
Intorr.Mi 'rial News rs-rv!e:
LONDON'. July :Mk There was an
important anl largely attended meet
ing of the Irish parlimentary party
in the house of commons this morn-
i r; ur at which the present situation
was discussed as well a the future
polio to be pursued by the party.
John Redmond, leader of the
Irish nationalists, presided.
Despite the official admission that
there is a gfe.it wave of uniest in
Ireland there is a feeling in official
circles that ultimately an agreement
will be reached which will be satis
factory to all the Irish factions.
John Dillon has given notice of a
motion in commons in - hich he will
ask the goernnient, in view of its
failure to produce the promised
home rule amending bill, to disclose
its plan for tin future government of
Ireland during the continuance of
the war.
An Exchange Telegraph dispatch
says that a resolution has been in
troduced in the council of Cork con
demning the Irish party's action re
garding home rule and calling upon
John Kedmond to resign as leader of
the nationalists.
The most Hev. William J. Welsh,
archbishop of Dublin, has issued a
letter to the public declaring that
the country now faces "a most truly
awful prospect." He predicted that,
unless there is a change in the situa-
tion the home rule, cause in Ireland
will lead to disaster.

Mexico Government Must
Either Guarantee Border
Protection or Agree to
Neutral Zone.

International News srv":
WASHINGTON, July 26. Failure
of the Mexico City government to
guarantee real protection of the
American border, or to agree to es
tablish a neutral zone along the
border, policed by soldiers of Mex
ico and the United States, are the
obstacles holding up the arrange
ments for settling the American
Mexican dilheulties y direct nego
tiations. The state department will
continue to insist that Mexico either
agree to protect the border, or that
the neutral zone proposal be accept
ed, before poing any further.
It is understood from ocMuals of
the Mexican embassy that Ambassador-Designate
Arredondo is doing
everything in his power to persuade
the "first chief" of the necessity of
agreeing to the American demands.
The late note in regard to the pro
posed direct negotiations outlined
the Mexican view of the questions to
be submitted to negotiations. These
ircluded withdrawal of the Amer
ican troops under Gen. Pershing, and
proposed fixing the responsibility
for the border raids In the past, and
punishment of those guilty. No men
tion was made of the means of
guarding against future outlawry
and bandit attacks by Mexicans
crossing; the line.
Suggestions that Mr. Arredondo
and Acting Sec'y of State Polk had
reached a deadlock in endeavoring
to arrange a basis for the direct ne
gotiations were met with denials
from the state department and the
embassy. The interruption in thf
almost daily conferences between
these officials. It was said "was due
to merely awaiting approval of the
American suggestions that the pro
posed negotiations should take intr
account the safety of the American
border.

EL PASO, Texas, July 2 0. Amer
ican customs ollicers receiwd reports
today that arms and ammunition are
being snuggled across the border
near the points where Mexican
snipers have been operating.
Carranzista cavalrymen sent out
from Juarez yesterday in search of
smugglers and snipers reported to
Gen. Francisco (lonzales, the com
mander of the Juarez garrison, that
they could get no trace of any such
lawbreakers, but in spite of this re
port there was further firing across
the Itio Grande from the Mexican
side early in the day.
Gen. Gonzales not satisfied with
the information brought in by his
horsemen, said he would arrest th
score of Mexicans living in shacks
on the "island," a strip of Mexican
land which juts into the Pio Grande
at the point where sniping has been
worst. It was near the "island" that
the smugglers have been operating.
"These Mexicans will be brought
io Juarez for examination and trial,"
said Gen. Gonzales "If any or
them are found guilty of sniping
they will be executed. The same
fate awaits convicted smuggler. s'

iCONTINCUD UN PAGC THPi:i:l
A
YOUTH IS HELD
TO GRAND JURY
Air May Have Been Injected
Into Arteries of Paoli,
Ind., Girl.
Iliternfttbue-il News Service:
OLXKY. HI., July 2i. Held to the
November grand jury, Roy Hinter
liter today stoutly maintained his
Innocence of the charge that he
caused the death of his sweetheart
by literally tilling her arteries with
bubbles, of air. Hinterliter was held,
following an inquest into what is re
garded as one of the strangest cases
on record, after physicians had been
aided by the barest chance in dis
covering the cause of her death.
Hinterliter's sweetheart was Eliza
beth Ratcliffe, a beautiful 17-year-old
girl, daughter of a wealthy Paoli,
Ind.. family. Regularly they went
riding in Hinterliter's rubber-tired
buggy. Priday night he drove to the
Olney sanitarium with her body.
"She complained of feeling ill. and
then she fainted," explained Hinter
lite" w ho is 21.
Physicians w ho examined the lody
found she must have been dead some
time. They also found she was to
become a mother, but there was no
evidence of an attempted operation,
nor were there any marks on the
body, nor evidences of poison in the
Btomarh. Then, by chance, a phy
sician pricked an artery. A bubble
of air came out. An autopsy re
vealed the heart and brain laterally
full of air bubbles, hut there was no
clew as to how they came there to
cause the girl's death by metabolism.
Then came a man to State's Att'y.
Morris with a package which he de
clared two boy friends of Hinter
liter's had picked up under a tree
where the boy and girl stopped, and
where there was ev idence of a strug
gle. It was a catheter from which
th' plunder had been removed. Phy
sicians declared it was the means
by which air was injected into the
eirl's arteries, and the jury loct no
time in holding the youth '.o the
grand jury.
Physicians say the girl's death
must have been instantaneous.
