less and without warning to
United States officials, one of the
British cuisers lying off Cape
Henry awaiting the appearance
of the German submersibles Deut
echland and Bremen, steamed
through the Virginia capes early
today, proceeded to the vicinity of
Fortress Monroe, cruised about
for an hour or more, and then
returned to a point just outside
the three mile limit.
The United States warship Louisi
ana and the collier Neritune were the
only Government vessels which sight
ed the ship, and a detailed report of
the incident was made to Washing
ton tonight by naval officers.
Act Most Unusual
Authorities here said that
while the entrance to American
waters without warning was very
unusual, they could see in it no
violation of international law or
navigation regulations.

NORFOLK, Va., July 25. How long
the cruiser remained inside the capes
has not been determined, but it is
thought to have been not more than
two hours. Members of the crew of
Mrs. Clara Baldwin Stoeker's yacht
California, said tonight they saw her
about half a mile out from the Ameri
can shore shortly before five o'clock
this morning. She came within a few
hundred yards of the California, they
said, and gave several German mem
bers of the yacht's crew a fright.
Fearing that the craft was to be
searched, they retreated into the hold.

cruiser was satisfied with his investi-l

WASHINGTON. July 25. Officials
here were inclined to believe tonight
that the British cruiser which made
an incursion into Hampton Roads ear
ly today had acted wholly within her
rights under international law.
A warship of a belligerent nation
may enter tie territorial waters of a
neutral nation with impunity it was
said, provided she conforms to navi
gation laws and does not remain more
than 24 hcurs. She could not, howev
er, repeat the entry. Should she come
again or remain more than 24 hours
she would be liable to internment un

United States and Denmark pro
viding for acquisition of the Dan
ish West Indies by this govern
ment at a purchase price of $25,
000,000. So nearly in agreement are the two
governments that an official White
House announcement this morning
predicted that the treaty undoubtedly
would be signed during the day. To
night the delay in closing the negotia
tions was nor explained but it was
'indicated that no material barrier to
their successful outcome had deTelop-
. ed
Signing May Be Delayed
It was suggested that the signing
might await the return of Secretary
Lansing from his vacation early ia
August.
Deal Kept Secret
T.he exact provision of the agree
ment is being closely guarded in the
belief that puhlit ity at this time might
place the negotiators at a disadvan
tage. Officials reluctantly confirmed
that the purchase virtually had N-ea
consummated and betrayed displeas
ure that reports from the advance
status of the negotitions had been cir
culated in last eight's press dispatch

to be the possibility that some t-iird
nation might bring pressure to bear
to defeat t'seir project.
In general terms the treaty is un
derstijd to follow one negotiated in
1902 by the to governments but
which lapsed when the Danish parlia
ment fail"d to ratify it. after the
I'nited States had acted favorably. It
is said to contemplate complete
