tlati«e until the whole place fell before
"their onslaught.
The German general staff regarded
the possession of Pozieres of such im
portance that they even brought re
inforcementy from troops which had
'(been fighting in the Verdun sector and
'these held tenaciously to parts of the
village until driven out or captured in
Itfie hand to hand fighting.

VOLUME FORTY-TWO MARSHALLTOWN, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, JULY 26, 1916.
FEDERAL ROAD
Funds Available For Build
ing New Highways Under
New Statute.
IOWA'S SHARE
IS $146,175
Apportionment Made on Basis of
Population, Area and Mail Routes—
States Must Appropriate Equal
Amounts to Secure Government Aid
—Agricultural Department to Ad
minister New Law.
Washington, July 26.—Apportion
ment among the states of the first
year's appropriation of $5,000,000 car
ried by the new good roads act was
announced today by the department of
agriculture, which has certified the
figures to the treasury department and
state officials.
To be entitled to its share each state
must provide an amount equal to that
put up by the federal government.
Texas gets the largest share, $ 291,
New York second, $250,707
Pennsylvania third, $230,644, and Illi
nois fourth, $220,9'26.
99
Before making the division Secre
tary Houston deducted 3 per cent, or
$150,000, set aside by the act for the
administration. Then the $4,850,000
was allotted to the states, on the basis
of one-third respectively to the ratio
of area, population and rural clelivery.
Iowa Gets $146,175.
Iowa's allotment is $146,175 South
Dakota's $80,966, and North Dakota's
$76,143.
The first installment is for the fiscal
yekr ending June 30, 1917. For the
four succeeding years the following
amounts are authorized 1918, $10,
OOO.OOOr 1919, $15,000,000 1920 $20,
000,000 1921, $25,000,000.
First Federal Aid Law.
The expenditures are authorized by
the Shackleford-Bankhead good roads
law, the first granting federal aid to
states in road building. It was signed
July 11 by President Wilson and gov
ernment officials are preparing to put
its provisions Into early operation.
Actual construction of some' of the
roads may begin this fall anij exten-
slVe construction 'next spring is
planned.
Appropriations for the present year,
ending July 1, 1917, authorized by
congress are $5,000,000. For the four
succeeding years they are, respective
ly, $10,100,0W $15,000,000 $20,000,000
and $25,000,000. The law provides,
however, _that no government money
shall be available unless the states
spend an equal amount, matching the
government contributions dollar for
dollar.
Every cent of the federal and state
funds, the act provides, shall be spent
to build new roads. Maintenance
costs thereafter must be borne by the
states alone.
Rules and regulations to put the
federal aid law, as it is popularly
known Into prompt operation are now
being drafted by the secretary of
agriculture, upon whom devolves prac
tically the entire work of supervising
the government expenditures. Im
mediate supervision will be by the
office of public roads and rural en
gineering, of which Logan Waller
Page is director.
A conference of highway representa
tives of all states and, possibly, of or
ganizations interested in the good
roads movement, engineering experts
and others to discuss measures for
promulgating the new law is planned
soon by Secretary Houston.
Agricultural Department Controls.
Routes and construction materials
of the new roads are to be finally de
termined by the secretary of agricul
ture. No public road can be built
under the law until its, location, cost
and character are approved by him.
Every road project with plans, specifi
cations and cost estimates must be
given his approval before any of the
federal money shall be available. There
Is no specific requirement that such
roads shall be permanent, but the act
declares they shall be "substantial in
character," the secretary being given
discretion to construe the question of
substantiability in each separate case.
A limit of $10,000 per 'mile, however,
is the maximum fixed by the law to
prevent use of the government funds
in building costly boulevards which
would not assist in rural development
Whether the new roads built under
the law shall be main traveled trunk
lines, connecting interstate highways,
or merely small sections scattered thru
out the stales Is also left to the discre
tion of the secretary of agriculture.
Construction of both Is expected. At
the proposed conference of state high
way representatives here, it is believed
that, proposals for a comprehensive,
correlative road-building scheme will
be reached. Tho American Highway
Association, the American Automobile
Association and other good roadg or
ganizations are interested in such co
ordination and correlation of the pub
lic roads thruout the entire nation. D6.
velopment of the national road system
as a whole Is the broad scheme and
aim of government officials, with the
aid of state authorities.
Co-operation Planned.
The machinery for co-operative ac
tion Is substantially as follows: States
desiring to secure their share of the
federal funds will, thru' their highway
commissions or departments, file for
mal applications, submitting the route
and character of roads proposed to the
secretary of agriculture. Should he ap
prove the projects, the secretary of ag
riculture will notify the state commis
sions and the secretary of the treasury.
The latter will then set aside the share
of the United States, which shall not
exceed 50 per cent of the cost. The sec
retary of agriculture will order pay
ment of the federal funds upon com
pletion of the roads, and Is also au
thorized to make partial payments as
construction proceeds.
The construction work and labor in
eaoh state is to be done in accordance
with state laws and un^er immediate
supervision of the state highway de
partment, subject to inspection and ap
proval by government engineers. This
leaves the states in control of the con
struction, subject only to Insure good
designs.
Selection of road routes, as well as
their type and structural composition,
is also left primarily to the state offi
cials, subject to approval or rejection
by the secretary of agriculture.
States Must Aid.
To secure a share of ^he federal
funds, state legislatures or counties
must appropriate sums equal to the
federal allotments. The act also re
quires formation of state highway com
missions, or a similar state agency, to
have charge of the state's part of the
work. Four states, Indiana, South Car
olina, Georgia and Texas, have no such
commissions, or corresponding organ
izations, but to secure federal funds
they must be organized. Other states
have no highway commissions, but
have substantially similar departments
or agencies.
Where states, like Illinois, are pro
hibited by their constitutions or other
wise prevented from acting under the
proposed contributory plan, the act
provides that tihe federal appropriations
may become available to separate
counties when they shall match the
government's contributions, such roads,
of course, being built only within the
contributing counties.
To give the states ample time to
build roads and to guard against hasty
or extravagant construction, the law
also provides that unexpected federal
appropriations each year shall be
available during the succeeding year,
while this year's allotments to states
which have no highway departments
shall be available for three years, to
give state legislatures time to create
such departments.
For enforcement of the provision re
quiring the states to maintain the new
roads without federal assistance, the
secretary of agriculture is authorised
to disapprove of further roads projects
from such states or their civil subdivi
sions and deny further government aid
If roads are not put in proper condi
tion after four months' notice.
Development of a federal corps of
highway engineers is one of the results
expected from the new law. Civil ser
vice examinations will be held Aug. 8
for many more highway engineers
needed 'by the government.

WILSON SAYS GUARDS
ARE NOT ON BORDER
MERELY FOR DRILL &
Washington, July 26.—In reply to a
complaint from Mrs. Henry Smith, of
Winamac, Ind., who has a son in the
National Guard, President Wilson
wrote today that the guard was being
kept on the Mexican border to protect
the country, not for drill, and that the
service the men were performing was
an honor to L^:m. The letter way made
public in answer to criticism recently
made. It follows:
"Your letter distresses me a good
deal because it shows me you have not
been correctly informed as to the pur
pose of having the National Guard at
the border. It is not fo» the purpose of
drill tiut for the purpose of defending
the country. The service iiie men are
performing is an honor to them and a
neces-sity to the United States. I can
not believe that the men would wish
to be excused or would lose heart be
cause of the discomforts and Incon
veniences of the service.
"The war department has the camps
under careful inspection and is usln«
every means known- to make them san
itary and safe ^rainpt ^disease. Th*
health record of the men is excep
tionally good.
"I would not have you think that I do
not sympathize with your distress, but
I beg that you will take these larger
matters into consideration."

Blame For Disaster Rescui Work
Believed to Have Been Careless.
Cleveland. July 26.—Rescue forces
went to water works crib No. 5, out in
Lake Erie, this afternoon, in hope of
being able some time today of pene
trating the remote portion of the death
tunnel, where the bodies of the unre
covered dead of Monday night's dls
nster still remain.
It is believed there are eleven bodies
still in tho tunnol, instead of twelve
as previously announced. Officials de
clare the first men trapped tjy the ex
plosion have been recovered and that
the corpses still in the tunnel are re
stricted to the eleven men. Including
Assistant Superintendent Vokes, who
went into the tunnel at 8 o'clock Mon
day night. •Sliould this prove to be
the case the total death toll of the
horror is twenty-one.
May Delay Completion.
Hope
that the remaining may
be recovered soon was strengthened
today when workmen were able to re
place the 'bull's-eye in the air lock,
broken yesterday to allow the poison
ous gases to escape.
Workmen were able to replace the
bull's-eye without detecting any trace
of gas. This led to tha bellof that
rescue parties may explore the tunnel
without danger. However, some of
ficials believe It may bo threo days
before the bodies are reached.
The city today faced the possibility
of indefinite delay in the completion
of the tunnel. The workmen declare
they will never again enter tho tun
nel. Only five workmen of ninety em
ployed at the crib were at the scene
today. They assert the tunnel Is a
perpetual peril. The city's Investi
gation into the disaster began today
with a conference this morning of
Mayor Davis, Law Dirwvtor Fitzgerald
and Utilities Director Farrell. They
made up a list of witnesses to be called
when public hearings open later.
Meanwhile, federal, state and county
officials were completing arrange
ments for their investigations.
Probe to Be Thorough.
Some of the questions to be deter
mined by the city's Investigation aro:
Whether air tests were made regu
larly In the tunnel.

Empty Hypodermlo Alleged by State
to Hav* Caused Sudden Death of
Elizabeth Ratotiff»—*Roy Hlnteriitap
Hel^ Grand Jury by Coroner—*
Crime 'Discovered by Aooi*
oy Surgeons.
Olney, I1U July 26.—'When a tiny
air bubble burst in an artery under
pressure of a physician's knife, the
first chain of evidence against Roy
Hinterliter, who brought the body of
Miss Elizabeth Rat.cllffe to a sani
torlum here in a buggy last Friday
night, was said by authorities today to
have been welded. The death of the
Katcllffe girl is said by medical
authorities to be without parallel it it
develops a crime was actually com
mitted.
Hinterllter was held to the graiid
Jury, which held him responsible for
the girl's death. The young man be
gan calling on the girl about ten
months ago, iwhen she came to Olney
from Paoli. Ind., to live with her sis
ter, Mi's. Bert Fancher. Last Friday
evening the couple went driving. The
girl is said to have died beneath an
old elm tree two miles from town.
Doctors say the girl was dead when
she was placed in the buggy.
Soon to Become Mother.
*We were getting near town when
she said, '.Roy, I feel bad,'" Hinter
llter told the physician. "Then she
fell over in my lap and I rubbed her
hands and leot, but couldn't bring her
to."
No marks of violence were aund«
but it developed that the girl soon
was to become a mother.
The stomach was examined. Mo
tra^e of poison was found. Then one
of the physicians stuck a prabe into
an- artery. There was a "pout" almost
Inaudible, as a bubble burst. It wu
said only two things known to science
would cause embolism in the arteriwh
faulty Injection with a. hypodermic
needle or a lesion of a luj|r.
No Needle Mark.
The body waa examined carefully
There was no needle mark. Ther* was
no lesion of the lung. The brain was
found to be full of water. The heart
when pierced almost exploded.
A man from a neighboring town
came to .State's Attorney Morris* of
fice with a package containing & sur
gical Instrument. He said he had
found one of the bey friends of Hinter
llter picking it up under the elm tree.
Sheriff West visited the spot and
found where a horse had been tied
and marks of a struggle in the sandy
soil, the imprint of a girl's hand and
a boy's shoe.
Instead of using the instrument as
Intended, it is maintained toy physi
cians that he used It as an unfilled
hypodermic needle.
To a friend who saw the young man
after he hud taken the girl to the sanl
torlum, tho latter Is quoted as say
ing:
"l am In bad. Take my rig home
and tell mother that I don't know when
I will be home."
Inquest In Secret.
The unfolding of the evidence which
will be presented to the grand Jury
against young Hinterllter has come by
slow dramatic stages from the time he
deposited the body of tho girl at the
r!an!tor: :rr, ur.M' the holding of tic in
quest amid the greatest secrecy.
No one was permitted to attend the
Inquest save the witnesses, the Jurors,
Coroner I. N. 'Martin, Sheriff West and
State's Attorney H. G. Morris.
The state's attorney explained this
by saying that the procedure was in
nature of a grand Jury hearing
tho
and that it was most Important to the
state's case that some of the evidence
be not disclosed at this time.
Secrecy Is being thrown around the
names of tho three most Important
witnesses—two boy friends of young
Hinterllter, and a man whose dis
closures first solved the medical prob
lem which faced the dootors who per
formed the a.utopsy.
