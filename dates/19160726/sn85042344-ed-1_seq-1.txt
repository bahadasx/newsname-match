Vote for Honest Elections
The curse of Oklahoma Is corrupt politicians and dishonest elec
tions," said J. J. McGraw, Republican national committeeman for
this state, when In Tulsa a few days ago. "On Tuesday, August 1."
he continued, "the voters will have an opportunity to land a solar
plexus blow against these parasites of modern civilisation, for on
that day they will be asked to cast their vote for or against the
iteracy test amendment Every scheme known to grafting, ma-chino-made
politicians has been resorted to in an effort to get this
law on the statute books. Every man who goes to the polls desir
ing to vote against tbls law must be armed with a lead pencil He
must scratch out the words "for the amendment" with the lead
pencil. If he uses a pen or a point brush he will be recorded as
having voted in favor of the amendment."
Arthur H. Geissler, Republican state chairman, in an article In
the National Republican, published at Muncie, Ind., comments at
some length on the literacy test amendment Among other things
he savs:
"If the literacy test amendment Is adopted, then every Okla
hoinun. In order to keep from being permanently disfranchised,
must find the reglstiar. during a ten-day period in September. 1918,
and then and there the prospective voter may be required to read
and write nineteen pages of the constitution to the satisfaction of
the reristrar, who need not himself be able to read or write. Or
else, the would-be voter must prove to the satisfaction of the reg
istrar that he Is a soldier or u descerdant of a soldier. It is optional
with the registrar, under the language of tho law, to accept the
word of the applicant or to require documentary proof."
To vote against the amendment scratch out, WITH A LI IAD

Four investigations city, cour.ty,
state and federal will be started to
morrow to determine the causo of the
gas explosion near the five-mile crib
end of the tunnel last nlgut which
entombed tho 12 men and released
the gas which overcame th two res
cue parties. The lack of safety do
vices gjcli as gas helmets and pul

of the 10, 000-foot tunnel also will
be investigated.
The frantic efforts of Gustav V. Van
Dusen, superintendent of waterworks
construction, and the members of tho
two rescue parties to reach tho men
Imprisoned by the explosion without
gas helmets or pulmotors. resulted In
the Increase in the death list. This
afternoon a third rescue party
equipped with the safety devices en
tered the tunnel and recovered the
rescuers, ten of whom were dead.
Leaders of the third party of rescuers
declared their belief that the dozen
tunnel workers' bodies are entombed
In seven or eight feet of debris and
that it will be the work of at least two
days to dig them out.
Wiring Was Faulty.
According to the federal investtl
gators the electric wiring in the tun

explosion, but most of those con
cerned with the disaster declare that
one of the unfortunate 12 workmen
probablv Jabbed his pick into a lance
i.o kct of nui. which caused the bla.rt.
Others say that a crossed light wire
mav have caused the explosion.
The tunnel was equipped with elec.
trlcally driven machinery for exca
vating. The party of eleven workmen who
were caught bv the explosion entered
the tunnel ut 8 o'clock last night. The
work has been carried on in throe
shifts. This forco was in chiirgo of
Harry Volkos, as shift boss. First in
timation of the disaster came when
William Iolan, lock tender in the air
chamber at the entrance to the tunnel,
heard the dull boom of an explosion.
This was about :0 p. m. lo!an was

chamber leading into the tunnel. This
door was Jammed by the blast and

WASHINGTON, July 25. The
partial answer to the state de
partment's request for Information
concerning the blacklisting of Ameri
can lirma by Great Britain was given
Informally to acting Secretary Polk
late today by Sir Cecil Spring-Rice,
the British ambassador.
Sir Cecil said the blacklist was not
directed against neutral trade; it waj
not intended to affect existing con
tracts and that the British govern
ment would be glad to consider the
cases of firms desiring to offer proof
that tliey had been put on the list
unjustiliably.
Mr. polk was assured by the am
bassador that the blacklist was de
signed solely to prevent British capital
and credit being used to support an
enemy. This, it was said, will be sot
forth at length In the forthcoming
foreign office statement which prob

WASHINGTON. .Tnly 2.1. Only
determination of a few minor
details remains to com lete negotia
tions of u treaty between the I'niled
States and Denmark providing for no.
quisition of the Danish West Indies
by tbls government ut a purchase
price of $2 5,000,000.
So nearly agreement are tho two
governments that an official White
nouse announcement this morning
predicted the treaty probably would
be signed during the day. Tonight
the delay In closing the negotiations
was not' explained, but it was Indl
cnted that no material barrier to their
successful outcome bad developed. It
was suggested the signing might await
the return of Secretary lJinsing from
his vacation early In August.
The exact provisions of the agree
ment arc being closely guarded, in
the belief thai publicity at this time
might place the negotiations ul a dis
advantage. Officials reluctantly con
firmed that tho purchase virtually
had been consummated and betrayed
displeasure that reports or tho ad
vanced status of tho negotiations had
been circulated in last night's press
dispatches.. Their chief concern Is
unrierstoo-i to be the possibility that
some third nation might bring proa
sure to bear to defeat the project.
Same as That of 1W02.
In general terms the treaty Is un
derstood to follow one negotiated In
1902 by the two governments, but
which lapsed when the Dunlsh parlia
ment failed to ratify it after the
United States senate bud nrted favor
