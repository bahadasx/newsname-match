guardsmen are withdrawn the lack of
protecting forces ; might result " In
raids of Mexicans across the line.

American Vessels Exempted
From Medical Examination
and Quarantine Inspection,
New Order
(AttoUu4 1?nn by ftderil WirelM)
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal- July 2$
American vessels between San Fraiv
Cisco and Hawaiian porta are relieved
of the necessity of quarantine stop
page: and, doctors' examinations, by
order from Washington received
today.
Dr. F. E. Trotter, surgeon command
ing the U. S.. Public Health Service
here; had not heard of the order when
the Star-Bulletin Jit noon gave him
the news printed1 above. It Is con
jectured that he will shortly receive
notification of tha new order.
The suggestion that the U. S.
health service examination of vessels
between Pacific coast ports and Ha
waiian ports be. abrogated has been
made several, times In the last few
years. Some months ago it was re
vived at a meeting of the Hawaii Pro
motion . Committee. - The committee
talked over the matter and decided to
abide by the. recommendations of the
U. S. health service officials here and
the territorial board of health. Dr.' J.
S-. B. Pratt, president ' of the .: board,
opposed the lifting of the. quarantine
examination plan, on the ground that
every precaution i to v safeguard v the
health of the; territory should be 'ob
served. - Dr. Trotter's; recommenda
tioa was also Sgalhst doing away with
the examinations.' He opposes the ahU
rogauon ot.inese saieguarus.
It was supposed until .the receipt of
the news above
t- the agitation had
been ended.
"With this new
der in effect, the
work of the local
flee of the Uf S.
service 'will be tut about la lialf.

with, the doctors? examinations is that

Soldier-Statesman Favored To
Succeed Count Okuma As
Head of Japanese Affairs
(Special Cable; to Nlppu Jljl)
TOKIO, Japan, July 26. Geri. Count
M. Terauchl, the soldier-statesman and
the governor-general of Korea, whose
presence in Tokio at this time has po
litical significance, is In lead of Vis
count T." Kato, tho head of the Doshi
kai, or the. government party and the
former , minister of foreign "affairs, in
their race for the premiership of
Japan. Gen. -Terauchl now appears
practically assured of .his immediate
appointment as the neit bead of the
Japanese government.
- Such is the latest development in
the political situation here today. The
general belief is that Terauchl might
at any moment be called by the em
peror to reorganize the present minis
try under the premiership of Marquis
S. Okuma, who is to resign from the
position in favor of the soldier-statesman.
The persistence of Prince A.
Yamagata, an elder statesman and
strong supporter of Terauchl, In urg
ing that the latter be named as the
successor to Marquis Okuma, seems to
compel the aged premier to open the
way for the appointment of Terauchl
despite the fact that Okuma Is much
in favor of naming Viscount Kato to
the position from which he intends to
retire. As Prince Yamagata is - con
sidered to be the strongest factor in
things political at present in Japan
Premier Okuma cannot do otherwise
hut recommend Gen. Teraucht to the
emperor.
Gen. Terauchl called this morning
on Viscount T. Hirata, one of the able
followers of Prince Yamagata, at his
residence and held a lengthy 'confer
on in the course of which they are
understood to haTe discussed the poll-4
t tical situation and nare seiectea men
who would be asked to enter the new
cabinet as soon as Terauchl Is appoint
ed new premier. Hirata wui unaouDt
edly join and both R. Wakatsngt, pnee
minister of the treasury, and Baron S.
Goto, . once minister of communica
tion, will be given positions in the new
ministry while both Gen. K. Oshima,
the minister of war, and Admiral X
Kato, the minister of navy, in the pres
ent cabinet, will he retained In their
respective positions. '
The authorities are taking " every
precaution to have the epidemic under
control and the cooperation by the
general public is looked upon 4: as , to
