IN TEXAS, U.S.
CITIZENS FLEE
Raiders Reported Near Tcrlin

Mexican Border.
ONLY 30 TROOPERS THERE
EL PASO, Tex., May 21. Mexi
can raiders are again in Texas.
Just what damage they have
done this time is not known, but
telegrams from Marfa this morning
stated that the raiders were in the
vicinity of Terlingau, southeast of
that town, and that all the Ameri
cans at the Terlingua quicksilver
mine and settlement nearby had
fled.
The bandits entered Texas Fri
day, when' they raided the Pool
ranch, near Presidio. It had beeni
thought,' that tfeey-had returnedto
Mexico, but last night they appear
ednear Terllngujrr" j
Only aboit- thjrty American cav-j
alrymen are. stationed at Terlingua,
and an equal number at Presidio,
which is on the border opposite!
Ojinaga, and south of Terlingua.
Re-enforcements for the entire'
Big Bend country are now on their
way mere irom uoiumous, IN. in.
SIXTH CAVALRY ON WAY.
Tho entire Sixth Cavalry, which has
been drawn away from the Pershing
expedition In Mexico, was passing
through EI Paso all night.
Tho first train should be In the Big
Ben country this afternoon, but It will ,
requlre several hours to detrain and
march Into the bandit Infested country.
Most of the Americans had fled from
the Terlingua camp when the news
spread of the Glen Springs raid three
weeks ago, but there aro people on the
ranches in the vicinity of Terllnsua and
Presidio who might become victims of
the raiders.
The Big Bend country has such a long
border line that General Funston has
almost despaired of protecting It as It
should be.
The general has called for all avail
able coast artillery and this he expects
to use for garrisoning the border towns ,
ana settlements in the Big Bend so that I
ii th nviirv r,o..iht win t,. f, ,

Automobile trucks have also been re
quisitioned for each artillery garrison1
and theso aro to be used to hurrv forces
from one section of the Big Bend to
another.
Disappointing- Delay.
The mllltla will be used In a short
time for this patrol work, but there has
been a disappointing delay tn whipping
the mllltla Into shape and General Fun
ston has Just appealed to the War De
partment to strip all the Atlantic and
Pacific coast fortifications of their ar
tillerymen, save enough to care actually
for the guns and forts, and send them
to him for use as Infantry.
Some will be mounted on horses and
some on automobile trucks to composn
flying squadrons to police the Big Bend.

the Jury In tho perjury trial of the

tho Government closes Its caso In
Criminal Division., No. 1, of the Dis
trict Supremo Court tomorrow.
District Attorney Ijuskey announced
on Friday that tho Government would
conclude the presentation of Its case In
about an hour of tomorrow's session.
It is understood that the defense at-
.,,.. wiii contend that the Govern
" :" , .,- -. ,, ,. Hm. f,i
ment has not made out a prima facie
case against the defendants, and that It
Is, therefore, needless for tho defend
ants to Introduce any testimony what
ever. Overruling of the motion to Instruct
the Jury to acquit would mean that
tho case would be prolonged for another
week or more by the Introduction of
evidence bv the defense. It Is estimated
that tho defendants' side of the ease
would take up about a week.
Then would follow the closing argu

a day each. Argument on the defense

prrnrni j'nurKency is inn nisgegi proo-
lem tn-war Department now naa to
deal with In' the Mei(can ..situation,
The const artillery, ordered to the
border when the three guard organlza
tlons wero called out. Is now on duty.
General Funston Is said to be prepar
ing to request more coast artillerymen
since after twelve days he has received
no help from the mllltla, and since this
delay has compelled him to withdraw
troops from Mexico to guard the border.
In addition to the apparent mutiny
In the ranks of the Texas guard, two
other Instances may be cited as an evi
dence of the militia's failure to rise
to the emergency.
Fourteen men In one, company of
mllltla ordered to the border asked their
discharge when called for real service
because "their famlllts are In destitute
circumstances."
Thrco companies and the band of the
New Mexico National Guard regiment
asked that the regulations be set asldo
"because 25 per rent of their number
cannot speak English."
Faces Political Influence.
The serious Bide of the situation. In
the view of War Department officials
grappling with tho problem of making
a paper army of guardsmen available
for real service Is that If the War De
partment doesn't meet the militiamen's
wishes and make over Its regulations
to suit them political Influence will bo
brought to bear.
Tho next step army officials expect
to be taken In behalf of the recalcitrant
TexaM guardsmen, tho forelgn-spenkinf
New -Mexican guardsmen and the others
with families to piovld'i for will be to
receive appeals from the govornors of
theso States nnd then from the Con
gressmen. The War Department fears
this will be n blow tn discipline.
A new problem w 1th reference to the
physical fitness of the guardsmen to ,
serve presented tfclf today In connec
tion with the discovery mad by Gen
eral Funston that many of the men do ,
not measure ip to regular army' phys
ical standards.
Section 7 of thn Dick lnw, which pro-1
vide for court-martial of mutinous
gunrdsmcii, also covers the question of
phvslcal examination. It provides: J
"That every officer ond enlisted man'
of the mllltla who hnll be call id forth

Fate of 'Little Woman'
Hangs on Solution Of
"Murder Farm" Case
HARTFORD, Conn., May 21. A little middle-aged woman, who
never cries, sits today on one of the narrow cells of the Hartford coun
ty, Conn., jail. Her days are spent in a tight-lipped self-mastery of
rioting nerves which her remarkable self-control denies even the tem
porary comfort of hysteria or collapse. Her nights pass in almost sleep
less processions of prison darkness.
She is Mrs. Amy E. Archer Gilligan, who, the police of Hartford
county declare, is a modern daughter of the ancient murder-house of
Borgia.
If an indictment be returned against her, she will learn her fate
from the lips of the "twelve good men and tnte" whom the State will
choose to sift the evidence against her. They will decide whether she
is an unfortunate woman, caught in the grim web of tragic circum
stance, or whether her name will go down in criminal history with those
of Nurse Jane Toppan, Frederick Mors, and Dr. Panchenko.
For Nurse Jane Toppan was the woman who fifteen years ago con
fessed to having poisoned thirty-one of her patients; Mors, a little more
than a year ago, admitted chloroforming eight inmates of the German
Odd Fellows' Home, in the Bronx, wherti he was an attendant; Pan
chenko was the St. Petersburg physician who removed froni life two
score human beings by a hypodermic loaded with the germs of cholera
and diphtheria; and Mrs. Gilligan is accused of having administered
arsenic to several inmates of the Archer Home for Elderly People,
which she conducted at Windsor, Conn., six miles from Hartford.

TERRIFIC DRIVE ON VERDUN
Kaiser Dealing Sledge-Hammer
Blows in Falnders, Cham
pagne, and the Vosges.
LONDON, May 21. Germany
is throwing the full weight of her
legions against the allies all the
length of the western front, from
the Vosges to the coast, a distance
of 450 miles.
In a series of tremendous offen
sives, the Kaiser's, generals are
striking sledge-hammer blows in
Flanders., the Champagne region,
and the Vosges, and at -the same
time the crown prince is throwing
his men against Verdun with in
tensified ferocity.
Coincident with the drive on the
west front,' the Austrians are con
tinuing their fierce onslaughts
against the Italian front.
Reports of the righting conflict.
Statements from Rome say the at
tacking force is making slight' gains
with terrific losses, while Vienna
and Berlin report continued suc
cesses and marked gains.
TERRIFIC FIRE.
Throughout the night and during the
morning hours the Germans kept up a .
terrific bombardment of the French po
sitions In Avencourt Wood Hnd Dead
Man's Hill with a violence that never
abated for a moment.
It appears that every available man
Is being used In the assaults against tho
allied positions. According to the latest
official accounts the Germans had swept
over the slopes cast nnd west of tho
Meuse and penetrated the first line t
French trenches, only to be driven out
by a counter attack.
West of Dead Man Hill, that Is In tha
Hill 304 and Avocnurt wood section the
Germans by nightfall had occupied some
ot the advanced French trenches, and
In one case even penetrated the second
French line, only to be driven buck with
great losses,
Thcro was alBn a determined, but un
successful attempt by tho French p
drlvo the Germans from their danger
ous hold on the Haucourt-Rrncs high
way, which furnlbhcd a cleur road to
the Verdun-Purls railway, only thrco
miles from Esncx.
Wedge Between Hills 804 and 287.
Two days ago the Germuna drnvo a
wedge down between Hills SOI and 287,
seized this highway, entrenched and
have held It ever since.
The occupation of this point stands
today the great menace to tho Fronch
communication between Verdun und tho
capital,
That the airman high command has
resolved to spate no en'oit to take Ver
dun Is evidenced by tho renewal of tcr
rifle attacks hgatnst the lino of Genrtnl
Petnhi and the sacrifice of more thou
sands of men.
Clinging tn their old mass formation,
tho Kaiser's troops mailed the French
trenches at the price of rows of dead
and wounded, succeeding In forcing
their way Into prt of un entrenchment
on tho northern slopes of Dead Man
Hill.
Encouraged by thl success a further

line, but tho deadly aitlllery fire shat

It Is believed hero that the German
Idea in thcue repeated onslauhtcs In

tho city and thoy tend to f 01 est all a

Only on Mich a double hypothesis ran
the willingness of tlio invading auny
to suffer such appalling losses for such

The Austrians ns though acting In
concert with their allies, nro moving
with largo armies In violent offensive
against the Italian front. Already thev
