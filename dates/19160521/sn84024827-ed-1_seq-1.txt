Features.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, May 20. Congress
today completed its part in enactment
of the first of the administration pre
paredness measures, the array reor
ganization bill and sent the measure
up to President Wilson for bis signa
ture. (
The House approved with only twen
ty-five. dissenting: votes the canfer
once report on the army measure,
which already had been accepted by
the Senate. It provides for a regular
army with a peace strength of more
than 200,000 men, backed by a feder
alized national guard of more than
400,000 and carries many reorganized
features worked out -by war depart
ment officials to make the nation's
fighting arm more effective.
Billion For Preparedness J
To complete these main elements of
the program of preparedness on which
the administration plans to spend
more than a billion dollars within the
next five years, congress still bas to
perfect and pass the naval bill, em
bodying the navy increases.
Eesides the personnel increases,
the measure provides for a govern
ment nitrate manufacturing plant to
cost not more than $20,000,000 for es
tablishment of a system of military
training camps for civilians paid for
out of the federal treasury; for a
board to investigate the advisability
of establishing a government muni
tions plant and for vocational educa
tion in the army. Federalization of
the national guard, would be accom
plished through federal pay and
through a requirement making the
guardsmen subject to the orders of
the President.
Eight of the Republicans, five Dem
ocrats, one Progressive and one So
cialist voted against the bill. The
minority leader Mann, who. believes
the measure inadequate was one of
those vo'ing in the negative.

MODIFIED NOTE
State Department Is Expecting
a Note From First Chief in
Which Better Tone May Be
. Expressed.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. May 20. The State
Department was officially advised to
day that it might expect soon a new
note from General Carranza regarding
the border situation. Indications are
that it will be of a friendly character
and it is thought possible General
Carranza may propose the framing of
a definite understanding along tbe
lines of the unwritten agreement
reached by the military conference
at El Paso between Generals , Scott,
Funston and Obregon.
Should this forecast be borne out,
the delecate situation created by Gen
eral Carranza's request for withdraw
al of the American forces would be a
eloped incident.
Special Agent Rodgers tat Mexico
City reported today that the attitude
of officials of the Carranza govern
ment had undergone a decided change
within the last few days. There were
evidences in many quarters, he said,
of increasing friendliness toward the
United States. Optimistic expecta
tions as to the purpose of the new
note are founded upon these state
ments. Officials here believe the change Is
directly due to General Obregon's re-1
port of his discussions with the Amer
ican chief of staff and border torn
rander. The American officers were
completely successful apparently, in
overcoming suspicions o the Wash
ington government's intentions which
the Mexican war minlstter entertained
when he was sent north or the con
ference. Rodgers reported that the Mexicans
now consider the critical stage result
ing from the Columbus raid bad pass
ed and said tension was greatly re
lieved in tbe Carranza capital.'

ed or captured. Further north the
British have withstood two German
thrusts in the region of Loos and
Wieljte and the Loy&l North Lanca
shire have recaptured a crater on the
Vimy ridge, the scene of much hard
fighting in the past few days. The
crater was captured by the Germans
on May 18."
In Tyrol the Austrians have follow
ed up their successes by compelling
the Italian foTces to evacuate the Col
Santo, southwest of Roverto and west
of Monte Maggio. the extremity of
their previous advance.
Losses Heavy '
According to tbe Austrian official
statement Italian prisoners so far cap
tured total more than 13,000 officers
and men. One hundred and seven
guns also have been taken.
Numerous air raids have marked
the warfare. German seaplanes raid
ed the east coast of England, but did
little damage, Iondon declares. There
was only one fatality. The casualties
from another German air raid report
ed by Paris total well toward fifty
persons being killed in Dunkirk and
Bergi:es and nearly forty Injured The
French declare that five hostile ma
chines were brought down in tlx en
gagements, while an eiual number of
aerial successes is claimed by the
Germans.

What ou see taking place on the
other side of the water is the tre
mendous 1 almost said final
process by which a contest of ele
ments may, in God's process, be
turned into a co-ordinatfon and co
operation of elements.
"For it is an interesting circum
stance that the processes of the war
stand still. These hot things that
are in- contact with each other do
not make muchvorress against
one another. Vner you cannot
overcome you must take counsel.' "
The reference was given signifi
cance by the President's hearers in
view 'of recent discussion of possibili
ties of ending the war.
Before, speaking. President Wilson
reviewed a parade. Afterwards he
was guest at a luncheon, motoring la
ter to David&'jn . College, where he
once was a student. At the college he
visited the room in which he lived as
a student.
The President and Mrs. Wilson and
their party departed tonight for Wash
ington. The President's address follows:
"I do not know, my fellow citizens,
whether I can interpret .or you today
the spirit of this occasion, but it is
necessary when we get together in
celebration like this to take counsel
together with regard to just what it is
that we wish to celebrate. You will
say we wish to celebrate the memory
of that time to which we look back
with much pride when our fathers
with singular wisdom of counsel and
stuotness of heart undertook to set
up an independent nation on this side
of the water; but it is very much
more important than we should re
gard ourselves as of the element of
our forefathers. There were only
three million citizens in that original
republic. Now there are one hundred
millions. It is a long cry back to
those modest beginnings, a great pe
riod of time not only but a great peri
od of profound change, separates us
rom that time, and yet I would remind
you that the same elements m-ere pre
sent that are present now.
Forever In The Makinq
"What interests mv thought more
than anything else about the United
States Is that the United States has
always been in process of being made
ever since that little beginning and
that there have always been the same
elements in the process.
"At the outset there was at the
heart of tbe men who led the move
ment for independence a very hieh
and handsome nasion or human lib
erty and free institutions. And yet

The fresh activity of the columbus

that it might bave connection with the
movement northward o General Persh

been informed large bodies of Ameri

No less than a dozen Bisbee
men left for Douglas yesterday
to join the encampment. Cap
tain Marshall said that at the
way things are going Bisbee s
first volunteer company would
be ready to be mustered in by
the first of the week, and if the
boys continued to come at least
one more company would be
formed and possibly more.
The class of men offering
themselves to Uncle Sam from
Bisbee is a joy to the eyes big

highly pleased with the way
things are going and with the
action of the Copper Queen and

says, as being shared in by the
boys. New equipment and uni
