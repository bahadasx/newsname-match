personal appeal and that Burton had
toured tbe state. The preferential
vote for president by the republicans
was 661 for Hughes; Cummins, 493.
and Burton, 144. A few scattering
votes were caat for Roosevelt. Tbe
democrats thought all one way In
Josephine county for president, and
as ther were no serious contests for
county office except for the nomina
tion for sheriff, the election lacked
"pep" from the democratic partisan's
point of view.

legislative ticket, and the race be
tween Dr. Smith and Geo. Lundbnrg

standing Voorhles, 736; Anderson,
455; Crow, 349.'
. Illaiirhitifl Wins Nomination

In the nomination of a republican
candidate for prosecuting attorney,
though E. E. Blancbard gathered in
the prize with a lead of 173 votes.
The total vote for this place, was 870
for Blanchard and 697 for Johnson.
The democrats renominated the pre
sent county attorney, W. T. Miller,
and the race In November will lie be
tween Blanchard and Miller.
Sheriff Smith Defeated
Five men were seeking the, nom
ination for sheriff upon both the re
publican and the democratic tickets,
Geo. Lewis, former chief of police of
the city of Grants Pass, proving an
easy winner upon the republican
ticket, the voters casting the present
sheriff Into the discard. Lewis re
ceived 672 votes to 411 for Smith.
The other contestants were Jewell
with 207. White with 188, and
Randle with 88.

Indicated here today that withdrawal
of the sixth cavalry from Mexico was
part of a plan to establish a heavier
border patrol. Camps will bo estab
lished 'along the 2200 mile boundary,
garrisoned by militia and regulars
now on the line, reinforced with such
troops as General Pershing may be
able to spare. This will be accompan
ied by a gradual withdrawal of Per
shing's men. The Americans will
patrol every mile of the border in
sufficiently heavy force to defeat any
attacking column. Military, stations
off the railroad lines will be supplied
by motor trucks. , . '
