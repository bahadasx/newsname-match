NO MORE FREE PAPERS
A great many people do not
consider that they are asking
anything unreasonable when
they call at the Ardmoreite of
fice and request the gift of a
paper. It would not be if we
were only required to give the
one paper, but that is not the
case. There is not a day that
passes but we are asked for
extra papers for one reason or
another and every day from
five to twenty-five papers are
passed out for which there is
no return. The price of paper
on which the Ardmoreite Is
printed costs now double what
it has cost heretofore, and we
are compelled to cut off every
item of waste that exists. Here
after every paper that goes out
of the Ardmoreite office will be
charged for. Do not feel hurt
if you are asked for the price of
the paper, should you neglect to
tender the price.

tration shipping hill, which is design
ed for the upbuilding of a merchant
marine and the strengthening of the
American navy, passed the house to

SECRETARY OF COUNTY ELEC
TION BOARD STATES THAT

John H. Oarlock, secretary of the
county election board, stated yester
day morning that he has received
many inquiries as to who the election
'officials in the various precincts of
'the county will be, but as they have
'not been appointed yet, the informa
tion sought was not forthcoming.
Mr. Oarlock stated that the appoint
ments would be made within a short
time but inasmuch as l he election
board desired to conform to the wish
es of the people in .this matter, sug
gested that the electors of each pre
cinct suggest names of men w ho would
serve acceptably to all parties.
The time is rapidly approaching
when this matter will have to be set
tled, and Mr. Carlock is very anxious
to have any suggestion that voters in
the various precincts of the county
will make regarding the appointments.

PRESIDENT ADDRESSES CROWD

THOUSAND AT CHARLOTTE.
SPEECH WAS BRIEF
Wilson S.iys Europe is Fighting Out
in War the Question America is
Fighting Cut in Peace United
States Has Set Example.
Charlotte, X. C, May 20. Presi
dent Wilson today addressed a crowd
estimated at more than one hundred
thousand on the occasion of the Mist
anniversary of the signing or the
Mecklenburg declaration of independ
ence. Governor Craig introduced him as
one of the greatest leaders the nation
has ever seen.
The president spoke briefly, de
voting much of his time to American
ideals.
He said Europe is fighting out in
war the questions America is fighting
out in peace.
"Here in America, we have tried to
set an example of peace by keeping
together," he said.
Wilson said he hoped that, the
United Stales, after the Kuropean war,
would be able to lift up the symbol
of the "still smart voice of humanity."
DR. WILLIAMS PREACHED ON
"THE LOST COIN" FRIDAY EVE
NING THEME THIS MORNING
"THE ETERNAL LOVE STORY."
Friday night Dr. Williams delivered
one of his brightest, most pleasing
sermons of all the series, at the tab
ernacle. His theme was "The Lost
Coin," but in his discussion he in
cluded a wider range of thought. In-1
deed, he discussed the entire fifteenth
chapter of Luke. This is ordinarily j
called the chapter of three parables, I
but he said it was a parable of three
chapters, which is a very discrimi
nating view. One word runs through
the whole. It is the word "Lost,"
a lost sheep, a lost coin, a lost boy.
The first illustrates folly, the second
insensibility, the third wilfulness.
Running through the whole also is
this great saying, "The Son of man
is come to seek the lost and to save
them." w
There Is nothing more foolish than
a sheep, unless it is a man or woman
in the matter of religion. The Kible
is an Oriental book, and to under
stand the force and meaning of all
three of these illustrations we need
to understand Oriental shepherd life,
domestic life and paternal life. Christ
gives us some glimpses in his par
able of the good shepherds. The shep
herd sustains a much more intimate
relationship to his sheep in Pales
tine than in our country. The rea
son many do not come to Christ and
become active church members Is
not due so much to a bad heart as to
a light head. Here Is a woman who
says she is not interested in the
church or the Bible or in Christ.
These do not appeal to her, nothing
in them for her. She would be just
as well satisfied, or better, even, if
these things were never thrust upon
her attention, hopes she will not be
bothered with religion, the Bible, the
church or revivals any more. She
would like to be where these things
are never mentioned. How silly, and
yet the picture is not overdrawn. She
is ignorant of how woman has come
up through the influence of n'.l these
which she professes to despise, at-

SEVERAL SITES ARE IN CONTEM

ARE NONCOMMITTAL. BROAD
WAY OR MAIN PROBABLE.
The fact that the Pioneer Telephone
company will spend approximately
$100,000 in this city within the next
years assures the patrons of the tele
phones better service in the future.
Just where the building will be erect
ed, has not been determined by the
officials, but those who are in the city
at present state that they have several
desirable locations under considera
tion and will select one of these in
the near future.
Mr. Berry and Mr. Sanders who have
been in the city for several days on
official business, stated yesterday
morning that so fur they were meeting
with no opposition to the agreement
between themselves and the city com
missioners and chamber of commerce
relative to the ten per cent clause, and
had already secured the signatures of
practically all of the subscribers to the
petition.
There is evidently going to be some
rivalry between Broadway and Main
street in securing the telephone build
ing. Hoth streets have some very de
sirable locations, but the officials who
are here and who have looked over the
ground nre non-committal and they
will probably not be Influenced In the
matter, but select the site best suit
ed to their convenience.

The French war ofl'iee de
clares that the attempt of the
Germans last night to cross the
Vser Canal, north of Ypres,
failed.
Berlin says that the French
failed in their attacks on the
German position on the road
between Haucotirt and Esnes,
on the Verdun front and de
clares that patrol operations in
the Argonne region resulted in
heavy French losses.
The British have gained an
important strategic point, the
crest of Viny ridge. The pos
session of this point means com
mand of the plain of Lens.
Since the British took over this
section of the Verdun front
from the French, the Germans
have held stubbornly to this
vantage ground and have in
flicted heavy losses upon the
British. Just after dark last
night, the Lancashires, who are
made up largely of cotton op
eratives from Manchester, ex
ploded a series of mines and
then rushed from their trench
es to the tops of the craters.
The British casualties were
light.
Six persons were killed and
thirty-eight injured in an aero
plane attack on Dunkirk and
Bergues last night.
The German asphyxiation
gas attack in Champagne was
repulsed, according to a Paris
statement.
Steinbrink Attacked Sussex
Washington, U. C, May 20. The
state department's information froni
entente allies' sources, made public
today, is that the German submarine
U-18, commanded by Otto Steinbrink,
destroyed tho Sussex, brings the cri
sis between the United States and,
Germany to a climax. Paris dispatch
es after the torpedoing, said that the
comander of the submersible was dec
orated by Emperor William.
Swiss to Resist Invasion.
Paris, May 20. Switzerland Is pre
paring to resist with all the forces at
her command any belligerent Invasion
of her territory, according to President
Camille de Coppa, who says the Swiss
army Is in splendid condition.
Another Raid on Seacoast.
London, May 20. Three German
seaplanes raided the English coast
last night, says an official statement,
dropping thirty-seven bombs, killing
one soldier and wounding two civil
ians. One of the aircraft was brought
down off the Belgian coast.
