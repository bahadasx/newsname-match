LONDON. May 20.? In Tyrol
the Austrian* have followed lip
their successes by compelling
Italian forces to evacuate the
Col Santo, southeast of Rovereto
and west of Monte Maggio, the
extremity of their previous advance.
According to the Austrian
official statements from Vienna
Italian prisoners so far captured
total more than 1.1.000 officers
and men. One hundred and seven
guns also have been taken.
As has been customary since
the great offensive started, Italy
continues to claim general re- j
pulses for the enemy. The latest
dispatch from Rome says:
"The great offensive of the
Austrian forces so far has found
such well placed resistance that
all their efforts have resulted, according
to official cotpmunicat'ions.
in heavy losses and the dispersion
of their troops. Several
thousand prisoners with arms,

This newest offensive by the Austrian* |
is declared to be. like all the other offen- j
sive movements in this war. a further !
exhibition of the efficiency of properly

began their operations after assembling
adequate artillery, which included
numerous new guns of high efficiency.

SANCTIONS RIDERS
UPON DISTRICT BILL
House Committee to Make
Favorable Report on
Special Rule.
AIDS PLAN TO ABOLISH
HALF-AND-HALF SYSTEM
Hearing Should Have Been Granted
to People of Capital. Speakers
Declare.
I j iic nuu.se ruies committee laie yesterday
afternoon authorized a favorable
report upon the special rule making in
order the legislative riders on the District
appropriation bill recommended
by the House appropriations committee.
of which the most important is the
rider abolishing the half-and-half plan.
The action of the r u l#e s committee was
taken after a brief hearing of Representative
Tinkham of Massachusetts,
Henry B. F. Macfarland, chairman of
the joint citizens' committee, and Col.
A. S. VVorthington. also a member of
that committee, all of whom vigorously
opposed the special rule and the main
part of the legislation which it proposes
to make in order.
Three For. Two Against.
The rules committee was not a unit,
however, in its vote to report out the
special rule. Three members voted for
the rule and two against it. The opponents
of the rule, who do not believe
that legislation of such great importance
should be attached as a rider to
a general appropriation bill, and who
do not believe that the legislation proposed
is fair to the District, hope to be
able to beat the rule on the floor of the
House, though it is doubtful in the extreme
that such will be the result of
the fight on the floor.
Under the special rule there will be
forty-five minutes' debate on a side before
the vote on the rule is taken.
It is expected that th District bill
will come up. and the special rule along
with it. in the House tomorrow. Rep!
resentative Cage of North Carolina, in
; charge of the measure, said last night
I that it was his purpose to call it up
! at that time.
Sfan/i M. ?
wvuuu vi iui. Xiunuaill.
Representative Tinkham, appearing
before the rules committee, urged that
it was the proper function of the District
committee of the House to give
consideration to and take action upon
all legislation relating to the District
of Columbia, and that the District committee
had had before it for months
the report of the joint select committee
of Congress on the fiscal relations between
the United States and the District.
He said that the District committee
should have framed a bill for
any legislation changing the present
organic act of the District, instead of
having the appropriations commitee attempt
such legislation as a rider to
the District appropriation bill. He insisted
that the people of the District,
who are so greatly interested in the
matter, should have been given an op!
portunity to be heard by* the District
committee.
Mr. Tinkham told the rules committee
that the recommendations of the appro|
priations committee were absolutely at
I >ai minx ? mi me recuinuieiiaaiions or
j the joint select committee of Congress,
which went at length into the whole
matter of appropriating for the District
last fall.
Called Indefinite.
"The report of the joint select committee
says that a system definite,
regular and liberal should be adopted
w C'ongress in its appropriations for
I the District," said Mr. Tinkham.
1 "There is nothing whatever definite
about the recommendation of the appropriations
committee?it 1s absolutely
indefinite so far as making contribution
on the part of the goverrii
merit; there is nothing regular about
I it, and it is not liberal, as the bill
i itself shows plainly.
i "Then the matter of the funded debt
j of the District The joint select comImittee
of Congress urged that this
! debt and the interest thereon be paid
j on the half-and-half plan, but the ap|
propriatior.s committee has included
i the appropriations for the funded debt
with all other appropriations for the
: District in its recommendations, doing
j away with the half-and-half plan."
j Representative Campbell of Kansas.
I a member of the rules committee, said
| that he had not read the report of the
; loint select committee carefully, but
| ihat he thought members of the rules
; committee should be given an opportunity
to go over this report before
I voting on the proposed special rule.
i Thinks Hearing Should Be Given.

mittee that the citizens of Washington
j whom he represented were opposed to
the abolition of The half and-half plan
and that they believed they should have
been given a hearing before the House
appropriations committee.
"We did not know until a half hour
before the committee acted upon this
matter that the appropriations comj
mittee was going to act," he said.
."And when we hurried to the Capitol
; to ask a hearing before the committee.
we were told that it was too late. We
i do not think that legislation of
j such great importance to the people of
the District should he rushed through
as a rider t<> an appropriation bill in
a manner making it impossible for it
to have proper consideration by the
House."
Mr. llacfarland laid special stress,
too, upV>n the failure of the approprfn
tions committee to give heed to the
report of the joint select committee.
: and pointed out the fact that it had
' paid no attention to the recominendai
tions of the joint select committee rej
garding the funded debt of the Dis|
trict.
Report Ignored Several Times.
"That is a striking and definite illusj
tration. showing how the appropria;
tions committee's bill fails to conform
i with the report of the joint select com|
mittee, and there are many other such
illustrations which we could point to if
we had time," he said.
Mr. Macfarland said that it had been
expected by thejoint citizens' committee
that a bill relating to the District
finances would be framed by the District
committee or by Representative
Rainey of Illinois, the ranking House
member of the joint select committee,
land laid before the House, and that it
: had expected to be given opportunity
to appear before the House District
committee on such a measure. He

WHITMAN TO NAME
JUSTICEHUGHES
\lew York Governor to Make
the Nominating Speech
at Chicago.
Gov. Whitman of New York, accordng
to reports from Albany, is to place
ustice Hughes in nomination for the
iresidency at Chicago.
The republican presidential contest
as reached the stage of negotiation
nd conference among the leaders,
Doking to concentration of the fight
.mong a very few candidates.
With the convention but eighteen
ays off, with delegations elected from
11 the states except South Dakota,
'exas and West Virginia, and still
vith no positive lead maintained by
ny candidate, the struggle is becomng
acute.
Hughes Sentiment Is Growing. j
The fact that considerably more than {
wo-thirds of the delegates are unin- !
tructed creates the element of doubt
,nd indetermination which at this
ioint dominates the outlook. Favorite
ons make large claims of strength,
vowed and expected, among the deletions.
The "Hughes sentiment" is
airipant and apparently growing. The
rouble with the favorite son candiates
is that not one of them knows
ven approximately what he may ex ect
from the uninstructed delegations.
I fie weeK JUSl niust-u w?aj? Iimmea oy
mportant developments, Hughes talk
ucreased materially and definiie reults
were obtained in Oregon, where
he vote was overwhelmingly for him
gainst Cummins and Burton.
Hoot gained strength, according to
lis managers, who now claim fortyive
votes in the New York delegation,
uore than a majority of that delega!oc.
Renewed Activity for Roosevelt.
An important development of the
veek was the revival of efforts in belalf
of the nomination of Col. Rooseelt.
A new organization was formed
n his beha.lf, headed by former Seereary
of the Navy von Meyer and Wiliam
Loeb. jr. The colonel himself
nade a foray into the west, and in the
lome of Henry Ford, who is a candiate
on the pacifist ticket, delivered
notable address in behalf of strong
Americanism. preparedness and pariotism
The impression was general among
eading republicans at the Capitol that
his is a final effort of the colonel to
ally support to himself which, it is
jenerally thought. will be utilized
igainst Justice Hughes, if it is found
hat the colonel cannot capture the
jomination.
A report was current in well inform - |
sd republican circles at the Capitol yes
erday that Col. Kooseveit, as a last i
lesperate attempt to checkmate Justice
Hughes, may turn to Klihu Root, denand
a strong progressive platform
tnd ask his progressive friends to sup>ort
the distinguished New York
itatesman and lawyer.
Will Not Swing to Boot.
However, a man who is prominent in
he group now engaged in the propaganda
in behalf of the suggested nomilation
of Mr. Hughes, expressed the beief,
which he said was founded on auhoritative
information. that Col.
ioosevelt will not undertake to swing
lis forces to Mr. Root, holding, it was
said, that the resentment against Mr.
Hoot for his participation in the Taft
lomination of 1912 is still too strong
imong the rank and file of the bull
noo8ers.
Two statements, coming from auhoritative
sources, were made at the
!apitol yesterday. The first was that
>ne of the "favorite sons" candidates,
vlth a known following of strength,
vill some time this week come out with
t declaration favoring Mr. Justice
Hughes. This will be certainly done, it
s said, if the new Roosevelt movenent
appears to be gaining headway.
The other statement was that some
'riends in Washington of Mr. Fairlanks
know that in no circumstances
* 111 the Indiana candidate for the
presidency accept second-place. It was
"S|k 'Jome
^,V&.
!iiirusSi>?OuiT SHOOT //wV
w,thout Mci/\
said that further talk of running him J
for the vice presidency will draw forth I
announcement from him that he would I
decline. |
Speculation About Fairbanks.
That statement was widely discredited,
however, by other republicans,
wh'o said they are morally convinced
that If the convention should, upon an
early ballot, choose another man by
anything approaching unanimity, Mr. .
Fairbanks could not refuse the nomi- \
nation for second place if it should
come to him.
It was Said by leading republicans at
the Capitol yesterday that the Oregon
returns, coming at this interesting stage
.of the contest, will assuredly give the
friends of Mr. Hughes, who are urging
his nomination great encouragement and
have important bearing in swaying sentiment
among the uninstructed delegates.
I
The Oregon outcome was all the more t
remarkable, it was explained, because of
the fact that while other candidates made | 1
personal campaigns in the state, it was j <J
necessary to resort to mandamus pro- I c
ceeaings even 10 geT Air. nugnes name on ^
the ballot, as he had refused to sanction its
use there, as he did in Nebraska. v
Reports reached Washington from j
Massachusetts that Gov. McCall is to be a
candidate for the nomination and contest
the support of his state with Senator 1"
Weeks, it was said that this alleged in- a
tention upon the part of Gov. McCall was ^
developed by friends of Gov. Hughes, who
are sounding out sentiment in the Bay *
state. Senator Weeks' managers claimed t
yesterday that he will have more strength t
on the first two ballots than any other j
favorite son candidate or a suggested
candidate. \
Representative McKinley of Illinois, who t
is the eastern manager of the Sherman ^
boom, gave out a statement claiming t
that the fight between Hughes and f
Roosevelt supporters in New York will r
turn attention to the west in the search r
for a candidate and that Senator Sher- g
man will be the favorite of the middle r
west. y
However, at this time very little de- r
pendence is being placed upon the estimates
of strength developed on the first ,J
two ballots, all politicians agreeing that s
the great unknown quantity in the sit- n
nation, the uninstructed delegates, and f
their "second choice" of candidates, will ii
in the end determine the contest.
Progressives Flirting With Root.
From sources close to the Root management
comes the statement that
progress seems to have been made be- 11
tween the progressives and the Root j c
people concerning the platform. There t
are no negotiations, no formal ex- 1
change of views, it is said, but each I
seems to know where the other stands 11
on what is agreed will be the live g
issues of the campaign. v
These are preparedness, the tariff *
and foreign relations. On basic re- <3
puDiicuii principles nuoi. n is claimed, 1
stands where he always has stood, v
Roosevelt, on his part, no longer 1
seems to consider referendum and c
Initiative and recall as principles 1?
which need be incorporated in a I
political platform. 3
Mr. Root himself is said to be es- P
pecially anxious for the progressives a
lo be satisfied with the platform, as n
well as with the candidate. It is un- j
derstood that he has been visited by | y
delegates from several states, whose j ii
presence in New York has escaped i o
newspaper notice, and has impressed | >
this on them. n
Western progressives on their part j s
have shown a very open-minded dis- j f
position, it is said. The Root campaign
committee found an unexpected de- ~
mand for literature which gave Mr.
Root's speeches on various subjects of
interest to progressives. One of these
was his address on "Invisible GqVernment,"
which at the time of its delivery
pained the old guard in NewYork.
A otufpmanl from * ~
-- - tiic l\juner seere-|
tary of Agriculture. James Wilson,)
strongly indorsing Hoot, has been extensively
circulated in the west, and
is credited with doing much toward
molding favorable sentiment among
the farmers.
The Hoot and Roosevelt folio wings
are said to be in complete accord in
the opinion that the candidate should
be able to interpret in advance the
platform and emphasise it before the
public.
The Root managers will listen to no
talk of a complimentary vote for Root
on the first ballot. They do not want
compliments, they say. and are more
interested in the third ballot than in
the first one. They claim that they
have the majority of the New York
delegation nailed down and copperriveted.
and that a few extra rivets
were put on during the last few days.
Hence, they say, the desire of the
minority of the delegation to let themselves
out of a difficult situation by
complimenting Root. Instead, they
prefer that Hughes be complimented by
his followers, voting for him on the
first ballot. Rack of this talk of com- j
plimentary votes is said to be a real
endeavor to secure harmony In the
New York delegation. _ ? - - ' i

GEN. SCOTT'S WORK PRAISED
American Commander Understood to
Have Convinced Obregon That
President Wilson Had No Ulterior
Motive Toward Republic.
I
] The State Department was
officially advised yesterday that it
might expect soon a new note
from (icn. Carranza regarding
the border situation. Indications
are that it will be of a friendly
character, and it is thought possible
< ieu. Carranza may propose
the framing of a definite understanding
along the lines of the
unwritten agreement reached by
the military conference at El Paso
between (iens. Scott, Funston and
Obregon.
Should this forecast be borne .out,
the delicate situation created by Gen.
Carranza'.s request for the withdrawal
of the American expedition would be a
closed incident.
Suspicions of Mexicans Overcome.
Special Agent Rodgcrs at Mexico City
reported yesterday that the attitude of
officials of the Carranza government
had undergone a decided change within
the last few days. There were evidences
in many quarters, he said, of
increasing friendliness toward the United
States. Optimistic expectations as to
the purport of the new note are founded
on these statements.
Officials here believe the change Is
directly due to Gen. Obregon's report
of his discussion with the American
chief of staff and border commander.
The American officers were completely
successful, apparently, in overcoming
suspicion of the Washington government's
intentions which the Mexican
war minister entertained when he was
sent north for the conference.
Mr. Rodgers reported that Mexican officials
now felt that the critical stage
resulting from the Columbus raid had
passed, and said tension was greatly
relieved in the Carranza capital.
Mexico Wants Formal Protocol.
The determination of the Carranza
government to reopen diplomatic negotiations
for a formal protocol probably
explains its delay in instructing
Eliseo Arredondo, its ambassador here,
in regard to negotiations over the request
for withdrawal which has been
handled as a separate question. Mr.
Arreuonao asited for such instructions
immediately after the border conference
adjourned. Gen. Carranza's
note suggesting withdrawal suspended
the conversations in progress as to a
protocol, and he apparently prefers
now to bring the situation back t<? that
point directly and of his own nfotion.
The only step taken toward a continuation
through diplomatic agencies
of the discussions at El Paso, as suggested
by the conferees, has been Mr.
Arredondo's request for instructions.
The State Department has made no
move in that direction, and so far as
known has contemplated none. State
Department officials are understood to
have been confident that Gen. Carranza
would receive from Gen. Obregon a
clear impression of the attitude of
the United States, in this confidence
they have awaited the result of Obregon's
conference with his chief.
Pleased With Scott's Work.
i Since Gen. Scott's return with a full
I report on the conferences. State I?e'
partment officials have expressed great
satisfaction over the results he accomplished.
Apparently the whole
basis of the Carranza request for withdrawal
was the suspicion of Mexican
officials as to the real purpose of the
expedition sent over the line after
Villa and his followers
The first meetings of the conferees at
El Paso were devoted to efforts by
Gens. Scott and Funston to clear Gen.
Obregon's mind of this suspicion. H<*
was assured that President Wilson had
no hidden purpose, and that if a clash
between the two governments was to
come u must uc- m i n.xi?r<i u> \ hiranza's
forces or result from the continued
failure of those forces to clean
up the bandit-infested regions.
(Jen. Scott was able to say authoritatively
that American troops woud not.
be withdrawn so long as danger of
new raids existed; but would be
promptly recalled if the Oarranza government
lent official aid in crushing
out brigandage. Ponding accomplishment
of that purpose, he was able to
assure Gen. Obregon that the task of
policing districts .south of Natnaquipa
would gladly be left to him. while Gen.
Pershing would withdraw toward the
border as rapidly as the region was
properly occupied and cleaned up by
Mexican troops.
Trevino Begins Task Promptly.
In reply to these arguments. Gen. Obregon
issued orders to Gen. Trevino to begin
clearing up the territory south of the
American forces and placed 10.000 troops
at his disposal. Reports from the border
and from Mexican towns indicate that
Trevino is carrying out his instructions
promptly- He was said to have reached
Chihuahua City in person today, prepared
to occupy territory recently held
by Pershing's men. but taking: care not
to so dispose his forces as to allow any
possibility of a clash with American
troopers.
The State Department received encouraging:
reports yesterday. nlso from
the Tampico region, where fears of antiAmerican
outbreaks have been expressed
in recent advices. No actual demonstrations
have occurred and yesterday's message
