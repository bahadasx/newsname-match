Are we all ready? We are.
Having feasted our Raze on tho re
publican rumpus, consisting of a few
light' workouts by Kid Catron, Hurri
cane Hubbcll, liursum the Bruiser
and Hough und Ready Uomero, we
will now be permitted, without money
and without price, to witness some
fancy exhibition of shadow boxing and

public. Knockout Jones, having fail
ed to Ret a match up to the present
time, will enter the ring and issue his
dcfl to take on any fighter at catch
weights before the constituency of
fering the best inducements, winner
take all.
The exhibition this week will lack
something of the tcnse and subtle
jockeying for position which charac
terized the one given by the republi
cans last month, and the chances arc
that it will furnish a less definite
hasla of forecast for future events;
hut at that, it is expected to clarify
the democratic atmosphere to a con
siderable extent and to show with
reasonable "certainty ninny things
which are now enveloped in a haze of
doubt.
Jones for the? Senate.
To begin with, it Is generally believ-
fd that Assistant Secretary of the In
terior A. A. Jones, who will be pres
ent ut tho convention, will announce
himself as a candidate for the nomi
nation of his party for 1nited State?
senator to succeed Senator Catron.
This announcement will be more or
less in the nature of a formality, for
since the death of the late Felix Mar
tine, no other name than that of Mr
Jones has been considered by demo-1
erats for the nomination for that of- j
flee, and a formidable number of'

Mr. Jones, who Is a national figure. I
While theso endorsements are not!
binding upon the delegates who arc
yet to be named for the nominating
convention, it wouldn't be a good
sporting proposition to bet that Jones
will not be nominated, or even to bet
that he will have any opposition for
the nomination.
State Senator W, B. Walton, of Sil
ver City, has been placed squarely in
the race for the lower house of con
gress by the. convention of Grant
county democrats which recently met
to select delegates to the convention
which will meet here Wednesday. Mr.
Walton will be here at that time, a""
it is certain that he will take an ai"
tlve part in the deliberations of tlle
convention. His strength with the
democrats of the state is confined to
ho section or faction, but is general.
As a vote-getter he is considered one
of tho strongest men in his party, and
the record made bv him two years
ago in
puiug up an uiiiiiri.ru.-.."-
democratic majority in his home
county in a year of general party dis
aster is considered one of the great
est achievements that any leader has
et made.
I'p to the present time Mr. Walton
' the only candidate for the seat
which is being kept as warm as pos
sible by Congressman Hernandez, and
his friends predict that the evidences
of support which are helng given and
'hlch will be multiplied when the

is to say, the formal selection has not
yet been made, but a straw vote of
the members of the state central com
mittee recently taken by Chairman N
IS. Laughlln showed that Mr. Harth
is the choice of a decided majority of
the committee, and all that remains
to be done is for the members in for
mal meeting 0 ratify the selection al
ready made.
Who will be the permanent .chair
man of the convention is a matter
that oanirot definitely be forecasted at
this time, but In view of the fact that
11. L. Hickley, of Raton, and Judge
Granville A. Richardson, of Roswell,
were the second and third choices,
respectively, in the traw vote for
temporary chairman, it In considered
probable that the honor will fall to
one or the other of the two. As Judge
Richardson was the chairman of the
last state convention, which was held
here two years ago, and the first
state convention, the chances are that
a sentiment in favor of rotating the
selections will lead to the election of
Mr. Riekley.

J Should this forecast be borne out,

Rodgers, at Mexico City, reported to-
'day that the uttitude of the officials

dergone a decided change within the
last few days. There were evidences
In many quarters, he said, of increas-
ing friendliness toward the United
States. Optimistic expectations as to
lnp purport of the new note are
founded on those statements.
Officials here believe the change Is
directly duo to General Obregon's re

completely successful, apparently, in

London. May 12. With the war not
far from completion of ltd second
year, the American newspaper corre
spondent In London have become io
accustomed to working under the han
dlcups, of a censorship that there la
now comparatively little friction be
tween the men who would eend tho
news and those who would stop It.
Although there nre occasional top.
page that are past understanding.
I correspondents generally have learned
the limitations under which they can
disseminate newg from a belligerent
I country and the censors have at tho
sime time become more reasonable.
Jn an Interview with Sir Edward T.
Cook who, with Sir Frank A. Swet
tenham, directs the press bureau, a
correspondent of the Associated Frew
has been given an exposition of the
principles under which tho handling
of news, both for tho foreign and Brlt
lh papers, Is administered under WP.r
conditions.

Sir Fdward Is best known In Jour
milium us the former editor of the
Daily News, and since his retirement
f,i,m ,h,u i,i"h h devoted
l himself to literary labors. .He linn
'edited John nukln'B works and was
Ruskin'a tlogrrnpher, mnklng hinny
Important contributions fo Knglish
literature, and since tho war began hfl
has published a life of Dclane, the
famous editor of the Times.
In beginning his exposition, 8lr
Edward said the press bureau never
censors articles or telegrams criticiz
ing the censorship. He urged the
correspondent not to speak "too much
jgood'' of the censorship.
I Ai"e Natural I'ncnilcs.
j "I don't suppose you are likely to
1 do no," he said, "but It would really
J be a terrible blow If you did. The en
terprising newspaper or news agency
, nnd an efficient censorship are nat
ural enemies, and If tho day should
'ever come when tho newspapers, llrlt
, lsh nnd neutral, conspired to praiso
tho press bureau, It would be a catas
trophe for one or other of us; It
.would mean either that the Journal
,1st had lost their 'go,' or that our
' censors here had been neglecting
, their duty."
Rlr Edward declared that the only
bouquet" thus far laid at the feet
of the censors came

I "That," declared Sir Edward, "Is
probably higher praise than we de
serve, but I think It Is pretty good ev
I idence that we have prevented some
'things which the enemy would have
liked and done other things which he
bus disliked. That Is a real compli
ment, for the press bureau Is a war
department."
Sir Fdward pointed to the British
government's notification upon the
outbreak of the war that the tele
graphic and radio services throughout
the empire would be suspended, and
lie emphasized the phrase contained
In this notification that the govern
ment would under certain conditions
permit the transmission of some mes
sages "as an act of grace."
Many McMsHgvs Panned,
"I sometimes wonder," he went on,
"wlittber It Is realised that Instead of
regarding every instance of a stopped
cable as an uct of wrong, you ought,
by the letter of the law, to recognize
every passed cable as 'an act of
grace.' The number of messages
which wo stop, delay or otherwise
deal with Is negllblo compared with
those we pass right uway.
"In quoting the government's noti
fication I am dealing only with rights.
Iu Interpreting the notification In
practice we do not, I assure you, say,
when a message Is put up to us:
Here Is un American message; come,
'let us kill It; we have the right.' What
I we actually say to ourselves Is: 'Let
j us free if this cannot lie passed as It
I stands.' And if It cannot: 'Let us see
. how little need be taken out.'"
Sir Kdward then explained that the
I censorship is governed by the defense
, of the realm act, by the regulations

and by Instructions, explanatory In
I detail, which are issued from time to
lime by the press bureau and by varl
jo, ous departments of state.
Object f Censorship.
The object of the censorship which
the Hritish government imposes, said
Sir Edward, Is two-fold: first, to pre
vent the British press, and the cables
