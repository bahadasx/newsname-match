"I never saw so much careless ex

factorj-. While I saw manj' signs
warning the workers to be careful with
their work. I did not see one w'arn
ing against spitting on the floor. I
do not see how human beings can
stand it. When I xisited the factory
in December the air was sickening.
"One of my patients who is in the
last stage of tuberculosis said that
when he was emplojed as an engi
neer in the factory the workers spit
down the elevator shaft upon him. He
thinks he got the disease in the factorj-.
"I am now -visiting thirtj'-six per
sons who have tuberculosis, ten of
whom are negroes.
' There is now a great deal of
whooping cough and mumps more
than there would be if parents kept
children with these diseases at home.
"The lives of some little ones who
died of measles last winter would
have been saved if the disease had
been kept from spreading by the en
forcement of quarantine regulations
like those of St. Louis and other
cities.
Some Homes Need Clean-Up, Too.
"Some private homes need cleaning
up as much as the shoe factorj'. Many
out-houses are in a dangerously fil
thy condition. There ought to be a
law compelling landlords to make
sewer connections for their tenants.
Many cases of tjphold result from
drinking water from wells that have
been contaminated by seepage from
out-houses.
"We need a health Inspector who
will devote all of his time to the
health problems of Columbia. When
I report bad conditions to the major,
I am referred to the Board of Health.
