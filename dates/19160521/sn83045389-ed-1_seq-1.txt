ASIIKVII.LK. _\\ <\, May 20.?It was j
announoed at to-night's session of th?
Southern Baptist Convention that the
remainder of the fund to meet the SiSO,
000 debt of the foreign mission board
had been apport lom-1 among the States
in flurh a manner that It was hoped the
sum of approximately $:<n,fioo necessary
to complete the fund would he raised
within two months
Taking iip miscellaneous business,
the convention, which at the present
session had voted down a proposition
to Join with other Protestant denomi
nations in union missionary work, to
night voted not to Join other denomina
tions in maintaining- a school In Shang
hai. China, for children of Protestant
missionaries.
The decision came after nearly two
hours of debate, during which Rev.
I>en O. Rroughton, D. D? of Knoxville,
Tenn.. v.-ho favored the union school, j
declared that "there's too much of
tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee In thej
time we. Sometimes take for our dis- 1
cussions."
At one time during the debate a ref-j
erence was made from the floor to "an
honest man" and President Burrows !
declared "the brother who made that'
remark deserves a severe rebuke." I
H. P. Buckner, a returned mission
ary from China, was speaking at the
time, and had made a statement In
which he referred to having heard of
efforts being made to "manage men."
Convention delegates afterward said
he referred to missionaries by the word
"men."

PROM T1IK CHAIRMAN
The statement no sooner had beor
made than from the floor came a re
ciuest to ask a question of the speaker.
Mr. Buckner granted it and was asked
If be would say whether he got bis in
formation about efforts to "manage
men" from ofilcer.s or others of the for
eign mission board.
"I decline to answer that question,"!
Buckner replied.
"If you are an honest man, you'll!
answer it," retorted his interrupter. j
"I'm an honest man. but still decline i
to answer the question," Buckner he- |
gan, when President Burrows rapped
for order and made his remark regard
ing the "rebuke."
Rev. John E. White, D. D, of Ander
son, S. C.. spoke against the union
school proposition, giving as one rea
son that it would "foment the discord
already lamentably evident among our
missionaries In China."
Recommendation to appropriate $1,000
annually for the central mission school
at Shanghai was mado In the form of
h majority report signed by Ryland

"KLA.NDO. FLA., May 20.? Efforts to
further the Interest of women to the
extent that they would be allowed to
preach In Presbyterian churches failed
here to-day after a five-hour debate
at the General Assembly of the South
ern Presbyterian Church In the United
States. The status of women as dea
conesses was not determined, that part
of the report having been deferred un
til Monday.
Interest was keen during to-day's
discussion, which ended in the vote of
132 to SO in favor of allowing the
status of women as regards preach
ing to remain as it if?. The proposal
to limit debate brought a severe pro
test from Dr. G. P. Ulackburn, of Co
lumbia, S. C., who said that the as
sembly was "facing one of the greatest
questions that can como before any
Presbyterian body, and to talk about
limiting debate on this subject Is folly."
A time l'rnit of ten-minute speeches ;
was voted, however.
The voto upheld the majority repor J
of the committee, to which the question
had been referred. A minority report
favored allowing- women to preach.
ItKPOHT IV FAVOR OF THUIIt
woiiK as iii:vcoxm:ssi;s
The majority report, submitted by j
the Rev. F. Cannofi, declared that
leadership and rule in the church be- !
longs to man. as directed by the Scrip- j
tures, but that the use of women sis j
deaconesses is not against Scripture !
teaching, and, therefore, in their homo |
churches and in home and foreign mis- j
sion fields women may worl: as !
deaconesses.
The minority report submitted by the j
Rev. James I. Vance, recommended ;
that women may teach and expound I
Scripture in the churches without vio- i
lating Scripture teachings. Dr. Vance I
declared that if women can bo trusted
to do church work, they can l>c. trusted
to tell about it. and that either one or
the other should be changed.
It was decided to-day to divide the;
discussion into four subjects, the ma- 1
jorlty and minority reports on the <
question of preaching:, and the majority
and minority reports on the status of
deaconesses. The first to be taken up :
was the minority report on women in |
the pulpit, submitted by the Rev. .lames'
T. Vance, of Nashville.

AS A I,AW OF TUB CHURCH
The liev. Neal L. Anderson, of Win
ston-Salem. X. C.. offered this substi
tute for the part of the report under
discussion, and it was adopted as a
law of the church:
"Inasmuch as the public preaching
of the Gospel is a breach of the minis
terial office, to the authorization of
which ordination or licensure is essen
tial, and inasmuch as the Inspired
Scripture as interpreted by our stand
ards, now here, in the case of women,
does not sanction such a solemnity,
but on the contrary does clearly pro
hibit II, this assembly does therefore
declare the, assumption of this sacred

COUNTY DELEGATES
TO SUPPORT GLASS
Henrico Convention Binds Repre
sentatives to Vote for Lynch
burg Congressman.
ACTION NEARLY UNANIMOUS
Democrats Almost Unit in Oppo
sition to Rorer James for
National Committee.
The sovereign County of Henrico,
represented by seventy-three freemen
In county convention assembled, en
rolled itself yesterday as tbe ehatnpion
of Carter Glass, of Lynchburg, adopt
ing a resolution which hinds its six
delegates to the State convention at
Roanoke to vote fur tho Sixth District
Congressman as the Virginia repro
sftitn?Ive on (he National Democratic
Committee.
The voto oj? the resolution, which
was offered by State Senator Jullen
r'"nn. was a victory for the house of
Mass that was absolute almost to tho
point of unanimity. Chairman Lewis
<?? Williams made a plea for a hands
off policy, asking that the delegates
be sent to Roanoke utiinstructed.
Charles W. Chlldrey, prominent In
county politics, joined htm In urging
the advantages of electing an un
t am moled delegation. Rut the conven
i tlon turned a deaf ear to their plead
1 Incs.
? 'harks E Chlldrey, son of Charles
W Chlldrey, moved Ihe adoption of tho
Gunn resolution, and it was carried by
n roar of "ayes." On the call f or
"noes" a wavering voice answered far
| 1,1 t),e of tho hall?a lone "nay"
that died aborning. On tho face of
the viva-voce vote the resolution stood
carried. 72 to 1.
EJECTION OF I)El.KfiATKS
I'OliI.OWS 1 MMEDlATEIiY
With the main question out of the
way, the convention proceeded prompt
ly to the election of delegates. Each
of the four districts retired and
brought back Its nominations for tho
single vote to which It was entitled,
and the selections were ratified by the
convention as a whole. Then the body
elected the delegates at large, entitled
to two votes.
The election resulted as follows:
Fairfield District?L. D. Ellis and W.
T. Sralthdeal. each with half a vote.
Brookland District?W. C. Saunders
and E. J. Tlmberlake, each with half
a vote.
Tuckahoe District?Harry C. Seattle
and L. C. Williams, each with half a
vote.
N arina District?George A. Stoneman.
Delegates at large?Charles W. Chll
drey, Jullen Gunn, W. W. Beverley and
Thomas C. Fletcher, each with half a
vote.
The convention adopted a motion
authorizing each of the delegates to
name his own alternate In the event
that he could not attend the conven
tion, and another motion authorizing
the Henrico County delegation at Roa
noke to direct any one of the dele
gates to cast the county's entire
strength of six votes. This was done
to prevent an impairment of the
county's strength should one or more
of the delegates find It impossible at
the last minute to attend.
O'UA.VXO.N IS INDORSED
FOR STATE COMMITTEE
| S. M. O'Bannon was indorsed by the
convention as a candidate for elec
tion to the State Democratic Commit
tee. This body is composed of fifty
members?five elected by each of the
congressional districts. Just beforo
adjourning the convention, by a rising
vote, unanimously indorsed the na
tional administration and the foreign
and domestic policies of President
Woodrow Wilson.
The Glass-James issuo overshadowed
every other question before the meet
ing. It had been commonly reported
that organization leaders in the city of
Richmond had been actively at work |
the day before, rallying their friends I
in the county to the standard of the;
D.m\ 1 Ho man, and county Democrats
arrived at the courthouse to find lively
caucuses in progress an hour before
tho time fixed for the meeting. Glass
sentiment prevailed, although here and ^
there was a sturdy party man who |
stood out for an unlnstructed delega- j
tlon. It was freely conceded that had!
?i recorded voto been ordered In the,
Gunn resolution, at least fifteen would ;
havo registered their vote against it. I
In the absence of Chairman Georgo j
R. Preston, of tho Henrico County I
Democratic Committee, Secretary S. M.
O'Bannon called the body to order at
1:20 o'clock. Lewis C. Williams and
Captain John Lnndstreet wore nomi
nated for tho permanent chairmanship,
tho former winning out by substantial
majority. Thomas C. Fletcher was
unanimously elected permanent secre
tary.
<;i \.N IS IX FAVOR
OF 1IAKMO.W !.\ PARTY
Senator Gunn lost no tlmo in intro
ducing his resolution instructing the
county delegation to vote for Repre
sentative Glass. Tho county, ho said,
had a right to express Its wish In con
vention assembled, and to direct Its
representatives at Roanoko to regis

emphasize factional lines. On tho con- i
