Murdered.
Waukegon, 111., May 20—Four men
were sworn into the jury today in
the case of Will H. Orpet, Univer­
sity of Wisconsin student, charged
with the murder of his former sweet
heart, Marion Lambert.
They were gleaned from 400 ven
iremen, examined since the trial be­
gan before Judge Donnelly last Mon
day. Each of the jurors is married
and has children. Their names and
occupations are: Lenn Barthell, ice
man H. P. King, clerk G. A. Thomp
son, farmer, and B.« W. Willoughby,
farmer. Another .week, it was pre

King, 21 years old, is the father of
a baby girl. Willoughby has two girls
and a boy. Barthell is the father of
twins, and a sixteen year old daugh­
ter, Martha, who drove in from the
farm today, in the family buckboard
"to fetch Pa home," she explained.
When she discovered that he had
been sworn in, she expressed the opin
ion that "Pa will be a hero back 'at
Antioch, but he ought to be home, be­
cause Ma's sick and I've got to do
all the work."
To Call Celeste
Celeste Youker, of DeKalb, to whom
Orpet is engaged to be married, will
be called as a witness by the state,
it was said.
"She will help to prove that Orpei
killed Miss Lambert," said States At
torncy Dady.
''She may be Ar Witntfsti, But she 11
do nothing of the sort," said
Youker's mother.
"Celeste to testify against me,
exclaimed Orpet, "that's all wrong-
Judge ppnnelly said he was sofry
Miss,-. Yiou.Her had to be called.
"i also wish," said the judge, "that

her couild) bekept out of the case. I
h&veertodr them and they do not be
longtrtthis case. They are the let­
ters of an pure hearted woman to the
man she loved."
Miss Youker Sees Orpet
Miss Celeste Youker of Maywood
will marry Will Orpet, if he is ac­
quitted of the murder of Marion Lam­
bert at his trial in Waukegon.
The University of Wisconsin under­
graduate has had this assurance from
the Hps of the young woman for
whose love he cast aside the pretty
Lake Forest high school girl, who
died from poison in Helm's Woods
last February.
Once during the trial yesterday
youngjOri/tt, as he sat,between hi^
father and mother, his lawyer's ta­
ble, dr$w from his." pocket a letter
written in a feminine hand on mono
gramed blue stationery.
The letter was from Miss Youker.
One is delivered at the jail every
morning. Orpet patches for them
eagerly. If they fail to arrive by the
first post, he is restless and morose
until the afternoon mail brings the
coveted epistle.
Kept Secret
Miss Youker's visit to her sweet­
heart had been kept secret. It oc­
curred Tuesday evening, but the news
of it did not leak out until.three days
later. The pretty young woman, who
formerly taught chemistry in the high
school at DeKalb, arrived at the Wau­
kegon jail with her brother, olaude
Youker, of Lake Bluff, and his wife,
formerly miss Marguerite Mason, and
Charles Orpet of Winnetka, Will Or
pet's elder brother.
Miss Youker was permitted to see
the prisoner alone. Sheriff oriffln
escorted the young woman to the floor
on which Orpet is imprisoned. She
slipped quickly to the bars that Bhut
off the row of cells and stood waiting
in silence in the dim light of an elec­
tric globe.
The sheriff called Orpet. The youth
was smoking a pipe over a maga­
zine story in a corner. He laid aside
the book with a smothered yawn and
lounged forward to see What was
wanted. His eyes fell suddenly upon
the silent figure standing in the cor
ridor. He had not seen Miss Youker

Baby Girl
Run Down
by Auto
Dickinson, N. D. (Special to The
Tribune)—The three-year-old baby
daughter of Engineer and Mrs. W. C.
Mclntyre of Dickinson, N. D., was
run over by an automobile about 7:30
o'clock this evening and almost in­
stantly killed. Thomas Montgomery,
agent for the National Life Insurance
Co., with headquarters at Dickinson,
was the driver of the car, which was
a Cadillac roadster.
The fatality occurred on the main
thoroughfare. Mr. Montgomery was
driving at a moderate rate of syeea
when the little tot darted across the
street immediately in front of the ap­
proaching machine. It was impos­
sible for the driver to stop his ma­
chine or turn out to avoid running
the little one down. As quickly as he
could do so he stopped and picking
the child up rushed her to a hospital,
where it was found her skull was
crushed, and death followed in a few
minutes.
•From all that could be learned of
the sad affair the driver was not to
blame and it was purely an accident.
Mr. Montgomery is feeling very bad­
ly while the mother of the little girl
is in a very precarious condition.

TO UNITE AFTER
WARI^ DEBATE
New Constitutiion Is Adopted by
a Vote of Three to
One.
MEANS UNION OF
SEVERAL BRA&Ott&S
'Minneapolis, 'Minn., Mjiy 20—The
Norwegian Lutheran Synod meeting
here, in extraordinary session to­
night, adopted by a vole of 3 to 1,
the constitution providing lor the
union of the Norwegian Lutheran
church with Hauge's Norwegian Lu­
theran .Synod.
The union constitution was jhit to
a final vote after the minority, which
sought to make certain changes in
the constitution had been defeated by
an overwhelming vote in their ef­
forts to prevent adoption of the ma­
jority report of the special commit­
tee recommending aceptance of the
constitution.
Anti-unionists entered vigorous pro­
tests over a restriction of debate, but
the Union faction forced the issue to
final action by voting down all mo­
tions intended to bring further delay.
Heated arguments between the oppos­
ing factions preceded the final vote.
The United Norwegian Lutheran
church already has adopted the con­
stitution, and the Hauge Synod will
vote on it at a meeting next month,
and if adopted, the other three bod­
ies then will meet and effect a per­
manent union.
There are loO.OOO members of the
•Norwegian Lutheran Synod, 285,000
members of the United Norwegian
Lutheran church, and 40,000 metneers
of Hauge's Synod.
...Although threats to secede were
^iade by the anti-unionists, it was
declared by leaders of both factions
tonight that such action was unlikely.
The meeting will adjourn after dis­
posing of a few minor routine niat
ters.

LOSS
is mil
Saratoga Springs, N. Y., May 20—
An effort to secure the adoption of
a report favoring the discontinuance
of several magazines published under
the auspices of the Methodist-Episco
pal church failed at a meeting of the
committee on state of the church to­
night, and the general conference
will be requested to authorize publi­
cation for another four years.
A minority report was submitted,
urging the consolidation of some of
the periodicals on the ground that
there has been a total net loss dur­
ing the last four years of $381,411.00.
The Journals are published in any
part of the country, generally under
the name of the "Advocate." The
minority also will ask that the edi­
tor be appointed by the book com­
mittee, instead of being elected by the
conference.

TAXATION FRAUD
Washington, May 20—Attempted
fraud and invasions of the incom^e

been frustrated by the treasury de­
partment, it was announced tonight
during the first nine months of the
current fiscal year. ...

WiiU v.. V.:
State Department Officials Are
Officially 'Notified to This
Effect.
THINK NOTE WILL
BE VERY FRIENDLY
Carranza May Propose the Fram­
ing of a Definite Under­
standing.
Washington, ttay^20—The State De­
partment was officially advised today
that it mieht expect soon a new note
from General Carranza regarding the
border situation. Indications are that
it will be a friendly measure and it
is thought possible General Carranza
may propose the framing of a definite
understanding airing the lines of the
unwritten agreement reached by the
military conferees at El Paso be­
tween Generals Scott, Funston and
Obregon.
Should this forecast be borne out
the delicate situation cieated by Gen.
Carranza's request for withdrawal of
American expedition would be a clos­
ed incident.
iAttitude Undergone Change
Special Agent Rodgers at Mexico
City reported today that the attitude
of officials of the Carranza governr
nient had undergone a decided change
within the last few days.
Officials here believe the change is
directly due to Gen. Obregon's report
of his discussion with the American
chief of Staff and border commander.
Gen. ROdSers reported that Mexican
officiate now felt the critical stage
r•(tefill Ing from the Columbus raid had
passed.
The determination of the Carranza
government to reopen diplomatic ne­
gotiations for a formal protocol prob­
ably explains its delay in instruction
to Elisio Arredondo, its ambassador
here, in regard to negotiations over
lUo request, for withdrawal which
'has "tJCGW handled as a separalte ques
tion. Mr. Arredondo asked for such
instructions immediately after the bor­
der conference adjourned.
Moved to Big Bend District
Movement of the 6th Cavalry from
Columbus, N. M., to the Big Bend dis­
trict where their announced objective
is reinforcement of the border patrol,
was begun tonight.
The censorship was clapped tight­
ly down at Columbus, but from of­
ficials'of the El Paso and Southwest­
ern Railroad it was learned that load
ing of the troopers and their mounts
on four special trains began this af­
ternoon. The first train j)Ut of Colum
bus left for the east aliout nightfall
From El Paso, the 6th will be trans
ported to the Big Bend over the Gal
veson, Harrisburg & San Antonio R.
R. The entire detachment should de­
train at Marathon, Texks, by Monday
morning. From there it faces a 95
mile ride to Boquilles, its point of
distribution.
The fresh activity of the Columbus
censor was not clearly understood
here. Military observers conjectured
however that it might have connec­
tion with further Movements north­
ward of units of General Pershing's
expeditionary force. This belief was
strengthened by the announcement of
General Gavira, Carranza commander
in Juarez, that he had been informed
large bodies of American troops were
mraching northward past Cases
Orandes.
Army men professed to see In the
new movement "an intent' far more
reaching than the strengthening of
the border patrol.
Close to Col. Sibley
Major General Langhorne and two
troops of the 8th cavalry, he led one
hundred and thirty-five miles south
of Boquilles In pursuit of the bandits
at Glenn Springs, were fifteen piles
from the camp of Col. Sibley today.
Col. Sibley reported, he had gone in­
to camp forty miles south of the bor­
der, and would wait there until Major
Langhorne came up with the entire
force.
General Funston today asked the
War Department for four coast artil­
lery for duty. The border line from
one end of the "Bend" to the other
is 390 miles long.
Troops Reported Withdrawn.
News that a regiment of American
troops havfe been withdrawn from
Mexican soil was received with de­
light here. General Jacinto Trevino,
who arrived in Chihuahua City today,
to take charge of tlie campaign
against the,bandits of Chihuahua and
Coahuila, declared that he will be

menace. He said he hoped Ameri­
cans would not misconstrue the

W|5 HAVE PEACE
Charlotte, IN. C., May 20.—President
Wilson, speaking here today, at an
anniversary celebration of the Meck
lenberg Declaration of Independence,
told his hearers that America's ex
ample of bringing all the world to
gether on terms of liberty, coopera­
tion and peace was a prophetic sam­
ple of mankind.
Involved in the European struggle,
said the president, is the very thing
that has been going on in America
—a competition of national standard,
national traditions and national poli
tics.
"Europe," said he, "lias grappled in
war, as we have grappled in peace,
to see what is going to be done with
these things when they come into
hot contact with each other. What
you see taking place on the other
side of the water is the tremendous
—1 almost said final—process by
which a contest of elements may in
God's process be turned into a co-or
dination and co-operation of elements.
"For it is an interesting circum
stance that the processes of the war
stand still. These hot things that are
in contact, with each other do no
make much progress agains one an­
other. When you cannot oversome
you must take counsel."
The reference was given signifi
cance by the president's hearers in
view of recent possibilities of ending
the war.
"I would like," said the president,
"to think the spirit.of this occasion
could ,be expressed if we imagined
ourselves lifting some sacred emblem
of counsel and peace, of accommoda
tion and righteous judgment before
the nations of the world, and remind'
ed them of that passage in the Scrip
ture:
'After the wind, after the earth­
quake, after the fire, the still small
voice of humanity.'"
E'efore speaking, President Wilson
reviewed a parade. Afterwards .Tie
was guest at a luncheon, motoring
later to Davidson college, where he
once was a student.

Theodore iRoosevelt wins out toy a

while securing only 62 first choice

votes, with 71 to his credit.
Tribune's Motive*. .«
The Tribune had no desire to in­
flate "Teddy's" boom, -but was merely
actuated in this straw vote by a de-
to get a line on its readers' pref­
erence.
That there is bitter opposition to
Roosevelt in certain quarters is
shown by the comments received on
some of the ballots, but he still his
a large following in the state. Burton

LaFollette is sixth, with Ford trajl
ing him in seventh place. The rest.
of the vote is scattered among thol
favorite sons. 1
The only possible question' whioh I
may be asked is whether the type of
person who votes for Col. Roosevelt.

most likely to participate 'in a vote?•
of this kiild. People ~vri$o are

that sort. But it is just as true that- *r
his personality stirs quite as great ve­
hemence among his opponents a&
among his supporters.
Just how the various candidates
ran is indicated in another column.
Many of the readers of the Bis­
marck Tribune made some interest­
ing observations. A Valley City suf*
fragette in voting says:
Suffragette Votes.
"It's fun for a woman to have a
chaifce to vote for president, even on
a straw .ballot."
iShe promptly names IaFollette as
first and (Roosevelt as second choice.
In voting for James R. Mann, a
reader writes across the 'ballot: "Any­
one but Root or iRoosevelt."
"Roosevelt first, last and always,"
is a favorite slogan for some voters.
A Jamestown reader declares that
•Roosevelt is very strong in his pre­
cinct.
One admirer of Roosevelt scribbles
across his ballot, "Can the kaisers,"
which indicates that some feel the
war will be an issue in the next cam­
paign.
All For Roosevelt.
A group of Garrison readers ob­
serve:
"The republican members of Em­
met Farm clubs, about 15 in number*
are for LaFollette first and nearly all
for Hughes second, or any republican.
other than Roosevelt. They will vote
democratic if Roosevelt is nominat-

An official of the Stark County Re­
publican club, Dickinson, writes:
Stark County Republican.
Having seen the advertisement in.
