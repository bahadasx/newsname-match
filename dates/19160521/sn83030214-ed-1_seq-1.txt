Detroit, May SO. Rooaevelt'i elevea
boara Ifl Detroit yesterday brOBght the
eity bnek to its old loyalty to him.:
He found it cold. eritical, tending to
oppoaitiOB to his new policies, despite
ita old liking for him, and he left it
openly his. There had been a strong
undercurrent for a wool paat, the poli?
tieians say. He brought it to the sur
faca and made it audible.
It is clear to-day that at least four
out of five Kcpul.l.ean voters iri Detroit
want Roosevelt nominated and that he :
would poll a far larger vote in N'ovem- ,
ber than any other man thnt could be
r.amed. It even K..Pms possible that
with any other enndidate, tha Stat.
would become doubtful.
Old Issues Are Dead.
Another thing that has been made
clear is that the Colonel's old power
to win support has not left him that,
once on the stump, a.s he would be
next fall, he would make startling \
changes in the middle Westem states
where ihc .'ampaign will pivot, in thej
Statoi arhere preparedaeaa and Au.eri
canism bave not yet displaeed his 1912
policies as the centre of public interest. !
In Michigan certainly, and appar
ently in other states where conditions
are aimilar, lie and he alone has the
peraona! popularity to hold the sup?
port both of the workers and the rich,
of those who want nocial justice nnd
those who fear foreigrr nggrcssion.
The Huphes support comes mostly
frorn the politieians Root has none.
ln passing, one more thing is clear -
the old issues are dead In two days
ent in tulking politlea,
no one has mentioned the tar-ff unless
aboat it. Americanism, prepar
. social justice, and the German
vote these are the things uppermo.t
in men's minds.
Support af Colonel Solid.
"A week ago I would have f-aid that
the Michigan delegation would be
againat Rooaevelt irom the firat ballot
till the lnst, that no public aentlmenl
eould ehange the delegatea." declared
one of them to-day. "N'ow there is
not a mnn from this part of the s'ut.
who is sure he will not have to come
. ,- foi tha ' oionel to-morrow. If this
Bp another ten days there
will be no question ahout it."
lt eral pointed out that Roosevelt's
.-rc reported to have a well
filled war .-hest.
"Th r money enough in
Wall Streel to put Root across," he
? i Rool i ad not boOB BOBtiOBed
before.) "The boya would expect to
be lynch'-d wh.-n they r;ot heme"
The ;irsr concrete evidence of the
rh r. r; _:?"* to Roosevelt came in a poll
whieh "The Newa," an afternoon pa?
per, is making. This showed a sudden
jump in the Roosevelt strength, both
:,< BgaiBBl Wilson and still more as
against Hughes.
Hughes Nrgliglble Seeond.
In the five previous days of the poll
Roosevelt had 2.649 VOtea, Hughes \i\h
nnd Wilson 2,685. Thus Roosevelt had
polled three votes to one for Hughes
nnd had accumulated a majority of G_
over W ilson.
To-day's vote gives Roosevelt 1,122,
Hughes 257 and Wilson 1,061. So. for
tha duv Of Roosevelt's vi.slt, he polled
four nnd a half votes to one for
Hughea and gained sixty-one over
Wilson almost as much as in the flve ;
days previous. The total Republican .
vote of 4,!.|ri against 8,640 for Wilson !
ulso is of intereat, though many of
th<* ballot-. show that the voters will
go to Wilson unless either Roosevelt
or Haghea, in many cases unless
Boesevelt only, ia nominated.
This vote ia "f partieular signifi
eanea ln connection with the general
belief thal it la in the factories that
Uld Ford the paciiix.. anti

London, May 1*0. - Hritish affairs from now onward dcserve the pro
fouml attention of all students of dcmocraey at war. Our parliamentarv
institutions through Bgta have b.-en adapted more and more to peace.
They hamper us heavily in eopfog with the despotu* executive of a grea*
..pponent whose system, on opposite prir.ciples, has heen ateadily le*
velopcil for two hundred years to sceure the fullcst tighting efficiencv
?_>f a nation in arms. ,
The British sense of this disadvantage waa for a long time instinctive
hut vague. It is now detinite. There is a conseious and powerful effor.
to throw off the last disadvantnge by enforeing a ehange in the temper,
even in thc form, of government.
It will he worth while for American readers to guard against super
ficial judgment". whieh regard as morbid and dangerous symptoms whieh
are not only healthy but indicate the immense vitality of the patier...
Our poiitical position, whieh seems to have disquieted some of our
good friends on your side, does not alarm ourselves, and can bring no
eomfort to the cnomy. We have no longer any fear of crises. It seems
that they are becoming our normal means of progress, just as waikin.?
has heen defined as a series of little fails.
No Weakness on War Issue.
It must always be remembered that the pacilist sect is insignifican:.
The effeetive critics of the British government consist of those who de?
mand plain and drastic measures for a stronger ronduct of the war, wh.
have quite clear ideas as to how that purpose must be attained, and who
would make any sacrilice whatever to win thr? war. Compared witn
.hat. they count party and personal issues as dust.
The critics are no more warmongers blinded by insensate hate of
f.ermany. Nothing of the kind. They admire Teutonic efficiency M
much as they ahhor Teutonic brutality. They have never underestimateci
any part of a task whieh is stubborn and gigantic, hut they have never
dottbted Britain'i ability to win when fully rou.-ed and adequately Ied.
The rooting is r.ow ..'rout complete. The adequate leadership ha.
yet to he produced. It will come. The government in its present form,

AUSTRIANS STORM KAISER IN BERLIN
6,000-FOOT PEAK TO MEET CRISIS
Occupy Coi Santo, South
of Rovereto ? Victory
Won by Artillery.
Austrian Head.uarters ivia Berlin
to London i, May 20. The army of the
Austrian crown prince, Arehdukr
Charlei Praaeil, whe wns only recentlv'
intrusted with his first high commar.i'.
continues to force the Itaiians back
toward the border in the southrr
tremity of tyrol, and has strenfrthened
and ertended its hold on the sections
of Italian territory won Wednesday.
The Itaiians have now been ejected
from Coi Santo, a peak 6,000 feet high.
but a few miles .outh of Rovereto.
Eurther prisoners and guns were t.ik.-n
until the Austriang now have l.'.uOu
men, with l'?7 cannon, tweive _8-cen-,
tmietre hoivitzers and sixty-eight ma?
chine guns.
This newest offensive by the Aus
trians is aleclared to be, like all the
other offensive movements m this war.
a further exhibition of the efficiency
of properly handled artillery.
The Austro-Hun^ariani began their
operations after assembling adequate
artillery, 4vhich iai-b-dod numerous ne4v
guns of ligh etticiency. The order for
the commencement of a bombardment
of full intensity wa- given last Satur?
day. with the result that the cannon
ading reached a degree of tier.
r.ever heretofore experienced on this
front.
C.uns Smother Italian*.
The Austro-Hungarian guns succeed
ed in smothering the Italian guns in
the sectors where an offensive wa'
planned, and thus the infantry was able
to begin work on Monday in the moun?
tains between the Brenta an I Etsch
' Adigei rivers. .Since then bitter moun?
tain tighting has been contlnuous.
Picked troops, under the crowr.
prince, aueteeded on Wednesday in
throwing their opponents back acroaa
the border directly to the east of Ro?
vereto and occupying the outermost of
Italy's permanent frontier support
points.
This position is especially important,
since it commands Arsiero, which is a
communication and asaembly point for
the Itaiians. Repeated attacks t?y the
Itaiians from the Sugana Valley against
the Austro-Hungarian left flank were
beaten back, and the Austrian*. eapt?
ured Capomolon and Tabaro, both part
of Itaiy's defensive outpost frontier
line and both highly important por-i
tions, since they ar.- litaatod OB Oil
tions of re.-per'.ively l.Woo and 1,899
metres.
Say Itaiians Loat a Corps.
The position at this point aiso en?
able. i the Au-tro-Hungarian artillery
to flar.k the Italian poitioai on Coi
Santo, at an elevation of _,114 metres.
Special troops of mountain ao.
were enabled to rearh its northern slope.
Theae troops attacked anal extended
their effort- westward. clearing the val?
ley on a line running from Capomolon
to Mareo and Muri, T>o*h of which thf
Itaiians were compelled to abandon.

Sculptor?Fly Paper Needed.
Flies are now as much of a menace in
Kurope as Zeppelins and shrapnel, ac?
cording to F. N. Tonetti, the New York
gculptor, who has recently returned
from the war front. As a result of his
description of the agoniei endured by
the wounded isoldiers tormented hy
these pests, two million boxes of fly
paper will shortly be sent to the war
zone by the women of the Vacation
War Relief to fulfil a need as great as
that for bandages or medicine.
"Beyond all words and all power of
imagrnation is that great black swarm
that hcvers over everything," Mr. To?
netti said. "They take away sleep and
appetite; they make life intolerable.

After try ng various methods of kill
