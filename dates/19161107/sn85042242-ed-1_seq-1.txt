GENERAL HOLIDAY TO BE
OBSERVED IN CITY TODAY
Capitol, Public Schools, Banks
and Other Institutions Will
Close for Election
The official dope on the eve of elec­
tion gives Charles Evans Hughes and
Porter J. McCumber all the best of it
in the North Dakota balloting for
president and United States senator
Admitting that Wilson may retain all
of the votes which he polled four years
ago, and that he may corral 25 per
cent of the normally Republican bal
lots which in 1912 went to Roosevelt
electors running on the Progressive
ticket, Hughes will still have a safe
lead of from 7.000 to 10,000 and it is
predicted that McCumber will run
even with the head of the ticket.
1
Of the 86.580 votes, cast for nation
al electors in 1912, but 29,555 were
polled by Wilson, while 48,816
were cast by Republicans, 25,726 for
Roosevelt, and 23,090 for Taft. /The
Socialists in 1912 polled 6.966, and the
Prohibitionists 1,243.1 Allowing Wilson
a live percent increase as his share of
llie general gain in the voting
strength of the staAe, and assigning to
him 25 per cent of the insurgent Re­
publicans who voted as Progressives
in 1912, he would have a total, of 37,
786 of the ballots cast today. Hughes,
if he sucuees.fp holding the normal Re­
publican vote of North Dakota and is
favored by only 75 per cent of the
doubtful ones who have returned to
the party since 1912, will, with his pro­
portion of the nominal five per cent in­
crease in electors, poll 44,503 votes
today, or 6.717 more than his Demo­
cratic rival. Wilson's plurality' over
Taft in l»t2 was 6.465, and he led
Roosevelt by onjy 3,829.
Benson Will fee actor.
There is every reason to expect that
Behnon will be .more of a factor in/to­
day's presidential v6te than any So­
cialist nominee for the' pr&Bidertfeyhas
been in any previous' election. Benson,
however', wyi draw abdtit equally
from both parties—iirob^bly mbre
frtjm Wilson than from Hughes—and
the ratios will remaiii ptiMsticaliy the
same as noted above", or will "favor
Hughes a trifle more. Hanly, it-is safe
to predict, gain over North Dakota's
1912 prohibition vote. In this in­
stance, also, the increase, aside from
the natural gain in voting strength,
will come about equally from the two
leading parties.
The Republican Strength.
Even in spite of important national
issues of a very disturbing nature, the
Republican majorities held good
throughout the state in 1912. Hall, for
secretary of state, polled 51,942
against C. A. Berg's 7,908 Jorgenson,
for state auditor, had 49.668, against
23,538 for Frank Stanley, and Gtinder
Olson, for state treasure^ garnered
50.359 ballots against f|J^63 for hi*
Deifocratic opponent,-Frank Lish. In
every instance where the Repnblican
party united on a candidate for state
office he was elected 'by, a vote of two
to one or better. Helstrom, who polled
31,544 votes against Hann'a's 39,811,
was the only Democrat who ran ahead
of his ticket.
75,369 Republicans Vote.
At the primaries last June 75.369 Ite
publicans participated in the nomina­
tion of a candidate for governor, Fra'z
ier, alone, receiving 39,246, of almost
half as many votes as were cast by
members of all parties at the general
election in 1912. The Democrats of
North Dakota in choosing a guberna­
torial nominee last June cast 11,420
votes. For United States senator, 69,
085 Republican votes were cast at the
June primaries, while Burke and his
opponent together polled but 13,436. In
the contest for the Republican nomi­
nation for attorney general, 71,893
votes were cast last June. The differ­
ence between 69,085 and 13.436 is to a
certain degree the handicap which
President Wilson and the Democratic
candidate for the United States sea
ate have to overcome at the polls to­
day. Of course, the vote polled by the
Democrats at the primaries does not
adequately represent their full
strength in North Dakota, while a
much greater percentage of Republi­
cans did visit the polls in June, be­
cause of the close contest on for gov­
ernor and~t?nited States senator-

Day of Calm in Political
Headquarters Leaders of
Parties Make Predictions
Fargo, N. D„ Nov. 6.—It was a day
of calm in political headquarters here,
both Republican and Democratic state
committees' headquarters showing
marked quiet in contrast with the
strenuous work of the past six weeks.
Supremely confident, Chairman
Lemke of the Republican committee,
is still standing by his prediction that
Hughes will carry the OTate by 25,000.
Chairman McLean of ^he Democratic
committee is standing by his asser­
tion that Wilson's majority will be
10,000.
Chairman Lemke today reported to
the national Republican committee
that they can depend on North Da­
kota. Chairman McLean has advised
the Democratic national committee
that thef state will be for them, his
national committee listing this state
as "probably" Democratic.
Rival candidates for the United
States senate concluded their cam­
paigns tonight in their home towns.
Burke at Devils Lake, and 'McCum­
ber at Wahpeton. Both candidates
were in Fargo today, and each ex­
pressed himself entirely satisfied with
his prospects.
Democratic claims as to the con­
gressional situation in the state are
optimistic. They profess to see the
defeat of H. T. Helgesen, Republican
senator in the First district, by Geo.
Bangs of Grand Forks they give Mc­
Donald, in tjie Second district, a ma­
jority over George M: Young and
talk about P. D. Norton being retired
in the Third district by Charles Si­
mon.
"It is a certainty," declared Chair­
man Lemke tonight, talking of the
outlook. "Confidential advices I have
received indicate a clear majority for
Mr. Hughes in our state. The national
outcome is not in doubt. Mr. Hughes
will be our next president.
"Wilson sentiment is strong
throughout the nation," said Mr. Mc­
Lean. "Our canvass of the rural sit­
uation in North Dakota reveals a Wil­
son strength that is surprising, and
which will return the Democrats vic­
tors tomorrow.

Two smill city dairies last month
were given^ the alternative of clean­

of one of these milk factories ran

Naturally, the solids, too, were above
the average. iBoth are dealers who
do a small neighborhood business,

the proposed district from which the
city commission may banish all live­
stock.
Stores in Good Shape.
Bacteriologist Richardson finds that
hotels, cafes and grocery stores en­
gaged in handling milk and cream
are in a generally satisfactory condi­
tion. The butter fat content of the
milk te3ted in October ranged from
3.5 to 4.5 per cent and that of the
cream from 18 to &>. The general av­
erage for cream was 18 to 24 per cent
butter fat. All of the dairies, with
the two exceptions named, conformed
to the city's requirements as to bac­
teria count. The inspections of the
two plans which received "clean-up or
quit" orders were made by Health Of­
ficer Strauss, in company with the
bacteriologist.

Betting Interest in Fargo
Centers in Judgeship Race
Pollock Favorite Over Cole
Fargo, N. D., Nov. 6.—Betting inter­
est in Fargo tonight swings to the
judgship of the third judicial district,
failure of local betting men to place
their money on Hughes, for president,
causing them to seek new fields.
As a result of the betting activity,
friends of Judge Charles Pollock, can
didate for re-election in opposition to
stuffs valued at $10,000,000. Captain
Koenig says he expects to make, his
dash back to Germany as soon as the
submarine gets its return cargo
abroad.
A. T. Cole, took new hope that their
favorite would be returned to the
bench. Pollock money being very
much in evidence, and some of It was
quickly covered. One bet placed to­
day was two to one that Cole wouldn't
have a majority of 200 over Pollick.
Wilson people are asking odds so
far as the state is concerned, but there
is very little Wilson money in sight.
Three thousand of Hughes' money on
the national outcome remains uncov­
ered, and tonight it is said that $5,000
of Hughes' money is available.
One interesting bet today, made by
a strong supporter of Porter J. Mc­
Cumber, who has toured the entire
state in his behalf, was that McCumber
would poll a majority of 5,000 over
Burke.
