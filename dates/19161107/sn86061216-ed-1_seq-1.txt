CONFIDENT THEY
WILL ELECT MAN
Campaign Leaders Predict
Big Vote Iowa Safe
for Republicans
MANY STATES ARE
STILL DOUBTFUL
New York, Nov. 6.—President Wood
/Tow Wilson and Charles E.. Hughes,
candidates of the dominent parties for
Somes
resident, remained quietly at their
today recuperating from the
[labors of the long campaign. The last
[word sent forward by them to the peo
jple was an expression that each felt
^confident of victory.
I President Wilson planned to remain
Itjuietly at home today and his only ac
tivity tomorroy will be a trip to Prince
ton to cast his ballot. Tomorrow night,
with only the memberB of his family
about him, he will receive the returns
In his study at Shadow Lawn.
Mr. Hughes remained at his hotel
early in the forenoon but later visited
the national republican headquarters
Ichiefly, it was stated, to thank the
workers there for their efforts in his
behalf. He intended to take a drive
through the parks this afternoon and
fepend the rest of the day quietly at his
hotel. Tomorrow he will vote in his
home district here and tomorrow night
he will get the returns In his hotel
rooms. Like Mr. Wilson, he plans to
have only immediate members of his
family with him when the returns
come.
Political headquarters here still
presented scenes of activity today.
Last reports from the political battle
field were received and final instruc
tions sent. Both the chairmen had
little to add to their forecasts issued
Saturday night.
Republican Chairman Willcox then
predicted Hughes would receive at
iMSt 100 majority in the electoral col
lege, while Democratic Chairman Mc
Cormick gave Mr. Wilson 364 votes in
that body. The necessary ettectlve
vote in the college is 266.
The larger participation of women
as voters in a presidential campaign
and the congressional elections are of
keen interest to politicians generally.
The returns from the states in which
women will vote, It is admitted, will be
closely and anxiously scanned.
Iowa Safely Republican

man Charles A. Rawson, predicted the
election of the entire republican ticket
by a majority of 40,000 and upwards in
statement issued this morning at
the office of the republican state cen
tral committee. He declared that the
situation was more than pleasing in
all sections of the state for both the
state and national tickets in spite of
the effort which has been made by cer
tain newspapers to split the* party on
false issues.
"We have canvassed the state thor
oughly," said Mr. Rawson, "and can
find no evidences of serious defections
from the party ranks. Indications
pointing to the normal republican ma
jority in the major portion of the coun
ty while many of them will return a
(larger
vote than was ever cast for a
republican before, particularly for the
head of the state ticket.
To Get Out Vote.
Instructions were sent out today by
istate chairmen for both republican
iand democratic parties, instructing
county chairmen to make all arrange
ments to "escort the vote to the polls

lowing afternoon talks in Rockland
county, will return to New York for
an automobile street comer tour.

their respective tickets the state chair
men were busy today making final ar
rangements for watching the polls.

State Chairman Tanner is that Gov
ernor Whitman, with his running
mates will carry the state by more
than 100,000. Democratic State Chair
man Harris and the Tammany leaders
are giving out no specific figures offi
cially but claim that the democratic

ers of Argentina.
Peoria, 111., Nov. 6.—A carload of
corn "from Argentina reached Peoria
yesterday and went on 'change today
in competition with Illinois and Iowa
corn. The consignment was eighteen
days In getting from the port of entry
to the United States, to Peoria. The
delay is officially charged to the loss
of a billing, but republicans assert
that it was due to a desire to keep it
off the market until after election.
The story that one million bushels
of wheat was being brought to Peoria
from Argentina, was published last
week. Republicans seized the oppor
tunity to show the farmers that the
Underwood tariff did not protect them.

branded the story as false and said
there was no such shipment of corn.

I.W.W. AND POSSE
HAVE HARD BATTLE
SIX MEN ARE KILLED WHEN
TOWNSPEOPLE USE FORCE TO
PREVENT INVA8ION.
Seattle, Wash., Nov. 6.—Six men are
dead and fifty are suffering today from
bullet wounds as the result of a battle
yesterday at Everett, Wash., thirty
miles north of Seattle, when 250 mem
bers of the Industrial Workers of the
World eought to land in that olty from
the steamer Verona which bad carried,
them from Seattle. The boat was met
by Sheriff Donald McRae of Snoho
mish county, who with a posse for
bade the men to land.
A shot fired from the Verona, ac
cording to the boat's officers, was fol
lowed immediately by firing from both
sides. The steamer hastened back to
Seattle with the dead and wounded.
The Seattle police took the dead to the
morgue, the wounded to the city hos
pital and the unwounded to the city
Jail.
One member of the Everett citizens'
posse, C. O. Curtis, formerly second
lieiitenant in the Washington national
guard, was killed and nineteen wound
ed.
Including the wounded, there are 294
men and three women under arrest
here. Forty-one men were taken from
a second steamer which failed to reach
Everett. The women were taken from
a motor bus which had conveyed them
from the northern boundary of Seattle
where they had disembarked from an
Everett interurban car. It is alleged
by the Seattle police that Miss Edith
Frenette tried to throw red pepper in
to the eyes of Sheriff McRae, while he
was being taken to a hospital In Ev
erett.
The fight was the result of a long
contest between the Industrial Work
ers and the citizens of Everett over
the right to hold street meetings In
th^ city.
Major C. D. Pennington of the
national guard was placed in charge of
the situation at Everett. The Everett
naval militia, the Snohomish company
and one company of militia In Seattle,
were under orders today to meet any
emergency.
Sheriff McRae, who was shot twice,
asserted that the first shot was fired
by a man standing before the mast In
front of the pilot house.
McRae said the man's action took
the posse by 'surprise, for while
trouble had been anticipated an open
battle was not seriously expected.
Four wounded members of the citi
zens' popse were In a critical condition
early today.

SEPARATE KINGDOM
RULERS OF GERMANY AND AUS
TRIA DECIDE TO GIVE LAND
AUTONOMY.
Warsaw, Sunday, Nov. 5, via Berlin,
Nov. 5, and London, Nov. 6.—The man
ifesto of Emperor William and Em
peror Francis Joseph again calling In
to existence the ancient kingdom of
Poland was read at noon today to the
assembled Polish representatives in
the royal palace by Governor General
von Beseler. Outside In the great
square inhabitants of the old Polish
capital gathered by thousands to at
tend the ceremony of what Is desig
nated as the rebirth of the Polish na
tion—a concept the importance and
bearing of which are making their
way into the minds of the people more
or less rapidly after Its long sleep of
more than a century.
Quickest to realize the significance
of the day are the academic youth of
the country, students of the University
of Warsaw, the Polytechnic school and
other higher institutions of learning,
who attended the ceremony in corpor
ate units bearing banners and wearing
the gay students ribbons. This after
noon they are leading parades and
demonstrations through streets, bright
with red flags. There are volunteers
by the hundreds for the Polish army
which the manifesto announced will
be called into existence.
The ceremony was short and simple.
Precisely at noon General von Besel
er, wearing the decorations granted
for the reduction of Antwerp and the
Polish fortresses, mounted the dais in
the gala ballroom of the old Jagellon
ian castle and in the name of Ger
many's sovereign read the imperial
manifesto. When he ceased the Pol
ish count Hutten- Casapski, the palace
commandant, read from a leather
bound pamphlet to the Polish notables
a translation of the manifesto in their
own language.
Crowd Cheers Teutons.
Then came cheers from the hither
to silent crowd cheers for Poland,
Emperor William, Emperor Francis Jo
seph, for Germany and the Germans,
and for General von Beseler.
President Brudzinski of the recently
elected city council, who Is rector of
the University of Warsaw, gave thanks
for the imperial decree. He asserted
the determination of the Poles would
be found worthy of the liberties con
ferred and asked that as the first step
toward the formation of the govern
ment a regent be appointed for the
kingdom, since the time was not ripe
for the nomination of the hereditary
sovereign promised in the manifesto.
General von Beseler replied that in
the midst of the world war had come
the moment of fulfillment of the long
cherished Polish wish for reestablish
ment of the Polish kingdom.
"Doubts as to the future," he said,
"can find no place in Polish hearts. It
will be our task, shoulder to shoulder
with the residents of Poland, to carry
the war to a victorious conclusion and
to heal the wounds of the war. Take
places at onr side, in confidence, which
we repay by the magnanimous deci
sion of the Austro-German monarchs
to place their seal on the plans for the
unity of Poland. We hope that soon
a Polish army will be fighting on our
side in token of the sentiment for de
velopment of the ney kingdom. May
all good fortune attend the kingdom of
Poland."
A band in an adjoining gallery
struck up the strains of the ancient
national anthem and the Poles in the
hall burst spontaneously into the
strains. The ceremony lasted twenty
minutes.

WARNING!
Voters Must Not Be lidtaeneed
Irresponsible Reports on
Election Day.
The candidates on the county
ets, both republican and democrat,
far as The Courier knows, have
good clean campaigns and the
dates go on their record before
people tomorrow. The efforts
ed to by the people who are fight
Lieut. Governor Harding have
the most disgraceful that has ever
smirched Iowa politics. It is doe
democrats of Iowa, however, to st
that the most^idiculous, absurd,
ish and disgraceful part of the
made against Harding has been
by men who have claimed to be
publicans. However, about 99
cent of those men have for
years been voting against the re
pub
can party while claiming that
were republicans. With the exc
of the fight made on Lieut Gove
Harding, the campaign has been ole
and respectable. That is eapeda
true of our county campaign. We'
this occasion to warn the voters
Wapello county not to be influenc
by any dodgers or circulars that
be distributed on the streets or
the voting places on election dayJ
