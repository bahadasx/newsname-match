f TO THE VOTERS I
L' : ,
This I election day. Bo not fall
to cast your ballot. The last two
weeks haYe' exhibited a tremendous
swing to the Republican ticket. In
the Literary Digest "30,000 straw
votes lnflveblg states," New York,
Hew Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, and Illi
nois, Hughes leads with a sate mar
gin., These states, will control the
National Election and at this writ
ing they are unquestionably for.Gov
crnor Hughes. All signs point to
the election of a deserved victory
for the Republicans in Nation, State
and County. Tho Republican ticket
will be electod.
BECAUSE This Is a Republican
Country. There are from a million
and a half to two million more Re
publicans In the United States, with
the Progressives back, than there
are Democrats. These Republicans,
of course, live In the Northern States
largely, and there Isn't any reason
why a Republican should vote the
Democratic ticket.
DECAU8E Mr. Wilson carried
only 14 states four years ago, tho
same old solid south and nothing
more, Mr. Roosevelt carried six
states, Mr. Taft 2 states and tho re
maining 26 states gave their elect
toral votes to Mr. Wilson, but in
each case a minority vote, In each
case against the express perform
ance of tho 'majority' of those who
voted. These 26 states are all Re
publican states and will give their
I electoral vote to Oovernor 'Hughes
in the coming election.
BECAUSE President Wilson has
' '9 pursued no policy at all. One day
It was' no moro array; andother day,
a great big army; one day free trade,
another day protection; now Villa,
next Carranza; now embargo, next
no embargo; now- too proud to fight,
next a punitlvo expedition.
BECAUSE Ho declared for one
term for the presidency and then re
pudiated it. Tho Republicans will
600' that he carries it out.
BECAUSE Of the humiliating
circumstances surrounding tho Bry
an and Garrison resignations.
BECAUSE Bolglum overwhelm
ed and mutilated her sacrod prin
ciples of free government derided,
and hideously assailed, he gave not
a word of cheer on free government
In Its struggle.
BECAUSE Germany "got Mr.
Wilson's number" early In the gamo.
Germany "at first thought 'he; might
be another Roosevelt but learned to
hordellght. a,nd .the disgust of Am
erica and all other civilized nations
that he was "too proud to fight."
BECAUSE In violation of the
Democratic platform of 1912 the Wil
son administration has not passed a
elnclo Important moasure of any
great source or of great moment, in
tho open, but in secret caucus behind
closed doors, from which the press
and- public have been excludod, and
tho records of which no man knows
except those who were In the caucus
and somo of them do not' seem to
know what happono'd thero.
t BECAUSE! This corrupt caucus
system, condemned by somo of tho
( Democratic leaders of Congress, has
rosulted in tho 'lavish appropriations
of monoya 1u the Southern states
'
although theso (Congressmen bound
by caucus and gag rule havo voted
appropriations for rivers and creeks
in North Carolina, whero It Is hardly
posslblo the rivers . .exist on the
ground, and lavish appropriations to
Instruct tho people of Louisiana how
to ralso horses and hogs, they have
declared It wantom and criminal ex
travagance. "
BECAUSE Notwithstanding
Democratic pledges for economy,
08,773 additional federal offlces have
been created, and the present Demo
cratic congross exceeds In Its appro
priations and obligations tho last
Republican Congress by moro than
1500,000,000.
BECAUSE President Wilson said
it was nono of our business, who
was President of Mexico and that as
long as ho was President nobody
Interfere with them, and later
BECAUSE He destroyed the only
government Mexico had and drove
its President from the country. ''
BECAUSE He took up with Villa
whose bandits murdered Americans
and ravished American women.
BECAUSE He later 'recognized
Carranza who defied him at the A. B.
C. Conference and whose soldiers
murdered Amoricans.
BECAUSE Ho raisod the Taft
Embargo, and while our army was
In Mexico permitted 2,650,000 round
of soft nosed bullets to bo, shipped
to Vera Cruz, every bullet of which
might plow Its way through the
hearts of American soldiers.
BECAUSE There Is no concelv
ablov reason on earth why any .Re
publican or Independent voter of the
United States should vote for Wood
row Wilson. , v ,
BECAUSE Of tho oxpediont, in
slncero stand of tho Stato Democracy
on tho vital Issues of tho day.
BECAUSE Their candidate for
Governor, tho Lagoon Millionaire, re
tired two years ago on account of
being too old to attend to his own
business, Is also too old to nttond
to the business of tho state of Utah.
BECAUSE Simon Bamburgor Is
the candidate of the classes, the Mil
lionaires, the liquor Kings, and the
expedient, Inconsistent, office seeking
Democratic party. -
BECAUSE Of tho Incapacity and
Inability of the County Democratic
Administration to perform just and
valuable sorvlce to the people.
BECAUSE Tho County Commis
sioners have favored themselves at,
tho expense of their constituents, and
proven boyond tho question, of a
doubt that, although they mlght'haVo
trlod to do tho best they can, tiey
are not equal to tho trust imposed
upon thorn. They have provon a
miserable falluro and If tho Inter
ests of tho County are to bo cared
for, thoy must be relegated to prl
vato life and give place to successors
who will glvo tho people a square
deal.
The fight Is on and all Republi
can and Independent citizens should
buckle on their armor and work un
til tho polls' closo tonight for tho
honor and Intogrfty of tho nation,
tor tho woll being of the Stato, and
for ability, equality, and Justlco In
the County.

CONCERNING
THOSE TAX ,
AMENDMENTS
A proposed amendment to tho pre
ent constitution on Article 13, Rev
enuo and Taxation has boon runn
ing in this paper for some tlmo and
for the past few weeks this amend
ment has been the target for con
siderable Are. Tho Utah Chapter
American Mining Congross has at
tacked It vigorously. Its advertise
ments havo been running In many
papers of tho state, and much llter
aturo has been mailed In opposition
to the amendment. Throughout
the campaign the State Board of
Equalization has been more or less
brought on the carpet, and at the
present stage we are reminded by
ono of our subscribers that it looks
more like a FIGHT BETWEEN THE
MINE OWNERS AND OTHER
PROPERTY HOLDERS OF THE
STATE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
There have been charges of "jokers"
In tho amendment by the 'represen
tatives of the mines, and denials' by
members of tho State Board of
Equalization.
In brief tho proposed amendment
repeals tho provision of the present
constitution requiring tho assessment
of all property at a uniform rato of
assessment and provides first that
tho taxes shall bo uniform upon the
same classes of property within tho
territorial limits of the authority
levying the tax. This provision, ac
cording, to representations of the
Stato Board of Equalization Is In
tended to permit tho taxation of
homes, non-producing property used
only as a shelter for the family at a
lower rato than that applied to gen
eral property.
Tho second object Is to glvo tho
legislature power to correct what
Governor Spry In his message to tho
legislature In 11)11 characterized as.
tho lniqultious .and unjust taxation
of tho surface ground of mining
claims. Tho present constitution re
quires that such land bo taxed at
tho price paid the government there
fore, which In the case of motallfor
oui mines Is uniformly $5.00 por
aero, while coal lands vary from
$10.00 por aero to $300.00, such
valuations to continue regardless of
the value- of tho land nnil reirnril-
less of whether or not it Is held for
investment, to bo operated or to bo
.worked out In values.
Tho third provision and tho one
that the Stato Board of Equalization
claims naturally arouses tho special
opposition of tho ownors of tho prop
erty affected Is that mlnos producing
not proceeds shall bo taxed In addi
tion to tho surfaco rights and Im
provements an additional assessment
of not t6 oxcced three tlmos tho
amount of tho net proceeds produced,
and on this account tho Board
claims that a largo fund has boon
raisod and is being spont for tho
purposo of dofcatlng tho proposed
amendmont. In further justification
of tho amondmont It Is recited that
the constitution provides that mines
that aro oporatod at a net profit
shall bo assessed on theso net pro
coods, nnd that In nearly all casos
the prlco paid the government por
aero for inlnoral land is onlv a small
fraction of Its actual valuo. That
for tho first tlmo In the history of tho
Slato a strong offort has boon made
this year to assess property at full
value, as a result of this condition
tho valuation of tho net procoods of
mines could not bo Increased and
tho taxes assessed against them could
not aggregate moro than 40 percent
of what thoy havo been In tho past,
all tax lovys havo boon reducod to
that extont, Tho net proceeds of nil
mines In tho stato for 1016 are given
at $21,622,651, and it Is claimed
that no ono would hold out for, a
moment that this' comes anywhoro
npar ropresontlng t)ie full valuo of
'th'o ' ra'tnos ofthe state'." Were ithe,

ford to dovoto part ot CTio day. Ev
ery loyal cltisen should dovoto at
least ono good day's work for
tho success of his party. Tho
campaign Is all over but the ballot
ing. Tho Democrats havo won their
regular September and October elec
tions, and it Is now up to tho Re
publicans to win the November elec
tion. There has not been ono logi
cal reason advanced why tho present
administration should bo kept in
power. It camo in as a minority
party, with over one million good
Amorlcan votes moro against It than

against It four years ago can do
fcat it now. Thero are moro Repub
