the Socialists, concern being felt by

school hoards, though under the conditions
usually met in school rooms
a maximum amount of fresh air is
needed.
He also declared that leeching

open throughout the year and the
children ore properly clothed to
withstand the temperature; a healing

of fresh-air rooms are marked

I an Institution, known as the Child I

The aim of this league is to provide j

age, whose mothers are forced to work
out by the day, often being obliged to
: leave their little ones at home, alone
; and uncared for, during eight or ten
| hours. The many disastrous results

known. This, It Is hoped to be able
to change and in this respect bring
Clarksburg up to the standard of Parkersburg.
Wheeling. Fairmont and other
West Virginia cities that have long
had day nurseries and child welfare
societies, by providing a place where
Jest such mothers may safely leave
their children during the day. The
plan also includes provision for boarding
children by the week, or month. In
cases where It seems necessary.
The league has been able to obtain
