An Unsually
IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAS
T THE
New York, Nov. 7. Fair weather
which was general throughout .the
country, except in the upper Missis
sippi valley and Western Colorado,
brought the voters out early today.
Reports at noon from practicallyall
sections indicated that a heavy vote
would be possed, some points saying
the bulk of the ballots had been cast
by 0 o'clock.
The big early vote surprised politic
ians and caused muchconjecture.
. Providence, R. I., reported the vote
throughout that state was the heav
iest ever known. Reports from New
York state, the Middle Atlantic states
and Western. and Southern points in
dicated keen interest everywhere.
Those in charge of republican and
democratic national headu.rters?i ex
pressed satisfaction with reports.
Political observers were - doubtful
as to just when results would become
known, but inclined to the opinion it
will be later than usual owing to the
complex situation resulting from a
great number of women voting and
other causes. ""'

ELECTION IN OCALA
The election in Ocala is passing off
quietly, as Ocala elections almost al
ways do. The polls opened in the
courthouse at 8 a. m. At Box 1, A to
L, were H. C. Packham, F. W. Ditto
and Horace Whetstone, inspectors,
and W. W. Clyatt, clerk. At Box 2,
M to Z, were W. H. McConn, J. W.
Aiken and Clifford Peabody, inspec
tors, and Norton Davis, clerk. Most
of these gentlemen have had exper
ience in the work and the voting pro
ceeded easily and rapidly under their
instructions. -
It was soon seen, however, that the
six booths provided by the county
were not enough, so the inspectors
borrowed two from the city, and then
improved two more, on a windowsill
and a table, where the voter was en
tirely safe from supervision.
At 3:30 over 550 had voted and vot
ers steadily arriving.

THE STOCKING HABIT
Miss May Collins, the "iridescent
singing and dancing soubrette" now
radiating with the Billy S. Clifford
"Linger Longer Lucy" company, is
said to have a very bad case of the
stocking habit. Most of the stage
divinities are noted for the legance
and abundance of their, hosiery, but
dainty Miss Collins is fairly .at the
top of the tree in thj$ respect.
f Her collection is simply bewildering
in its profusion and unlimited variety.
It is authoritatively declared that she
is the proud little proprietor of more
stockings than are possessed by any
six actresses extant.
Mr. Clifford says that if the young
lady continues blowing in her money
on stockings that the railroads will
compel him to pay for an extra bag

from twenty-five precincts here gave
Hughes 1389 to Wilson's 974; sixteen
precincts in Wichita gave Wilson
880, Hughes 416; nine precincts in

GOVERNORS ELECTED IN
SEVEN SOUTHERN STATES
(Associated Press)
Atlanta, Nov. 7. Governors are to
be elected in seven Southern states,
Arkansas; Florida, Georgia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee
and Texas today. United States sen
ators are to be chosen in six states:
Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, Ten
nessee, Texas and Virginia. In Mis
sissippi and Virginia the democratic
nominees are unopposed.- V
The democrats claim the Southern
states will run up the usual majority
for Wilson. The republicans appear
not to be making much of an effort,
except in North Carolina and Ten
nessee, where they are hopeful of
gaining a few more congressional
seats, but the democrats, while con
ceding them the two they already
have in Tennessee are making a fight
to take away the one they now hold
in North Carolina.

FEEDING ON TUNNY FISH
Taking the Place of Beef, Mutton and
Pork with Hosts of
Teutons
Berlin, Sept. 30. (Correspondence
of the Associated Press) All Berlin
these days in living "in the sign of the
tunny fish" the best substitute for
genuine meat that has been discover
ed since there began to be a restric
tion of the regular meat supply. - On
"meatless" as well as other days tun
ny now occupies a respectable place
on the bill of fare of every big Berlin
restaurant, and great uqantities of it
are being eaten.
One large and very well patronized
cafe, for instance, offers, each Tues
day and Friday, under the heading of
"Meat Dishes," the following four
items: "Fricasee of tunny with rice,
Tunny Schnitzel with peas, carrots
and fried potatoes, German beefsteak
of tunny fish with spinach and fried
potatoes, tunny goulash."
The meat of the tunny is coarse and
somewhat strong, or gamy, and too
much of it palls. But it is neverhte
less an excellent substitute for meat,
and likewise a relief from the . finer
fish that grows very tiresome if eaten
week in and week out. The supply of
tunnys is said to come principally
from the Adriatic.
