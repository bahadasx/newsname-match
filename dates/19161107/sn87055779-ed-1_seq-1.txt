CHICAGO, Nov. 7. The algebraic
"as" on this hectic day the 1,500.
ii:) women voters trekked to the
polls in large numbers this morning
with the peditieally dreaded "bal
ance of power" in their handbags.
They went about their work very
furiously and with every indication
of earnestness at least in Chicago
while campaign managers, district
captains precinct bosses and com
mon wa. . heelers looked on with
doubt and misgiving.
""They can't be figured on!" wail
til one captain, down in the first
ward the famous first made so by
the political peregrinations of "Path
Jluuse John" and "Hinky Dink."
The wail seemed general. The
women weit- the political thorns in
the side of the dopesters. And there
;ire 1,. "00,1100 of these thorns scat
tered throughout 12 states.
Tom, imm Women in Illinois.
In Illinois alone, approximately
Too.ooo women are voting for pres
ident today. These figures are
based on the registration, and al
lowances made for the many who
undoubtedly Will not east their bal
lots. In Chicago alone there are
jnore than ::o0,oo0.
Publicly campaign managers .n
both sides are proclaiming to llie
high heavens that the women are
with u?." Privately they admit
they don't know any more about
how the women are voting than
their questioners. The wail of the
precinct captain, "They can't be fig
ured on!" seemed to lit the case per
fectly. The balloting of the women in
Chicago early was heavy. There
were only a few in line when the
polls opened at a. m., but starting
a half hour later they came in
t-eemingly necr ending numbers,
and by S o'clock thousands had
voted. This eh . pile the advance
liKurmg of the wiseacres that "the
Women won't be around till they've
pon tiered their noses."
(Jo to Polls Ilarl.
Mrs. and Miss Chicaiio went to
the Noting booths this morning
without powdering her nose, judging
from the early balloting. Fair

which hae been conducted in Chi
i.imi were larm.lv responsible, for
this, politic i ans said. Chicago and
Illinois hae just passed through
city, state and national campaigns
that for bitterness have nerr been
equalled. etc: ans say. The women
vote has leen tb.e main bone of con
tention. Political managers have in
a general way counselled women
olers to follow the male voter::. Hut
they ery frankly admit they don't
know whether they have succeeded
er not.
Charges th it w omen w ere beim?
rnislcil by -heiniiik' hamters-on into
oting opposite to their convictions
appeared early. In several wards it
was reported to the police, that
women had as.ed how to mark their
ballots for ither democratic or re
I uMiean candidates and had been
told wronuly. Th charges became
thicker a the d.iy progressed and
promised to make some 11th hour
Jin w orks.
As reports continued to sift into
the various headquarters during the
forenoon, it became increasingly
evident that the early balloting
woi:ld break all records for both
men and women. Tb.e ure atet rush
of woraev came ietwren 7 and 1
o'clot k. and from then on it slump
ed perceptibly until 2 o'clock when
;t was I.c.ncd the irrealer mass of

WILSON MONEY
PLENTIFUL ON
ELECTION
Both Sides Are Confident
When Actual Voting Be
gins National Chair
men Predict Victory.
iVTCORMICK SAYS HE
GAVEG. 0. P. TOO MANY
Hughes is One of the Early
Birds and Draws Number
13 Wilson Votes
at Princeton.
International News Service:
NFW YORK, Nov. 7. The jury
is arriving at its verdict.
In every state in the Fnion, the
performances of the Wilson admin
istration today are being passed
upon by the supreme tribunal the
people. On the decision will deter
mine whether there is to be a con
tinuance in ppwer in the nation of
the democracy, headed by Wood row
Wilson of New Jersey, and Thomas
It. Marshall Indiana, or whether
republicanism is to place it in the
persons of Charles Fvans Hughes
and Charles W. Fairbanks as presi
dent and vice president.
The actual voting began today
with both sides supremely confident.
At the last moment a wealth of
Wilson money drove the betting
odds in New York and Chicago
down to 9 to 10, with Hughes still'
favorite, and even money in many
instances.
New York voters are casting their
ballots rapidly, according to reports
leceived at h-:h national headquar
ters this morning.
Chairmen Talk.
The two national chairmen made
the following statements while the
votes aru being cast:
William P. Willcox, republican:
"Mr. Hughes will have at least
100 votes to spare in the electoral
collegei
Vance .McCormick, democrat:
"Late reports from the west in
dicate that I gave Mr. Hughes too
many votes when I allotted him 70
in the electoral college. We are go
ing to tarry every one of the so
called doubtful states."
The influx of Wilson money in
the closing hours of the campaign
gladdened the Wilson followers.
rJ hey saw in it an effort on the part
of the professional betting element
to "hedge" their bets in the light of
the latest reports of increasing sen
timent in the west. Singularly
enough the Hushes supporters also
seemed well pleased with the change
in the betting odds. They agreed
that the Wilson followers hael util
ized eveiy available dollar in a last
minute to swing the betting for the
effect it would have upon the voters,
and they argued that this action
had come too late, while the money
tied up could not be used against
them.
Two Candidates Vote.
The republican precedential candi
date was one of the early birds at
the polls today. By. drawing ballot
No. LI the lucky number of Pres't
Wilson his followers declared that
he merely emphasized that lie was
to replace the resident in his job.
He was in excellent form when he
leached the laundry which served
as a polling place. and smilingly
posed for the photographers and
exchanged jests with Iiis newspaper
bodyguard.
