WOODROW WILSON
President of the United States
"HE HAS KEPT US OUT OF WAR"
This is the face of man strong, courageous,
patient and kindly, a man .
Alway alert to the aspirations of hi fellow
man and sympathetic toward their fulfillment;
Never complacent toward the encroachments
of privilege nor tolerant of social wrong;
Alway seeking to enhance the dignity of
labor and better the state of the toiler;
Never lending an ear to the sophistry of ex
ploitation or the blandishments of expediency;
Alway patient to hear and weigh, to ap
praise and analyze, and passionate to find the
way of right;
Never premature in purpose nor prejudiced
la Judgment; and never headlong in decision
Suck is WOODROW WILSON.
