Open resentment on the part of members of the
University of Washington faculty over a divorce suit
tiled in the superior court by Mrs. B. G. Morrison
against F. M. Morrison and followed last week by the
sudden disappearance of Mrs. Bessie G. Morrison, wife
of Professor Frank M. Morrison, of the mathematics de
partment, who has been partially paralyzed in a Portland
sanitarium on a leave of absence for nearly a year, has
caused one of the greatest sensations of its kind ever
known on the campus.
The divorce petition of Mrs. B. G. Morrison states

That hundreds, if not thousands, of Se

day's election thru failure of the new voting
machines to work smoothly, was indicated
by the flood of complaints that reached The
Star, the auditor's office and the county
headquarters of both parties before noon.
No provision was made to supplement the
voting machines with printed ballots, either
in cases where the machines failed to care
for the voters as fast as they were supposed
to or while out of commission thru break
downs, due to faulty machinery or the un
familiarity of the voters with the intricate
set of levers.
In some cases, the lever final is not being
pulled back all the way. If that is not done,
the vote is not recorded.
