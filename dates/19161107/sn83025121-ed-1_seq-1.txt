Outcome of Presidential Cam

Is That Whoever Wins WiH Do

UTMOST CONFIDENCE

(Ass r4rl WtrUM.)
NEW YORK. November 7r
With the leaders on both
tide claiming to be confident of
victory by substantia majorities
and with each announcing the cer
tainty of carrying all the pivotal
States, the curtain rises this morn
ing on the final act of the presi
dential, campaign- of 1916.
Weighing one claim against the
other and basing a prediction up
on the net results of all the claims
and canvasses, it appears that the
voting today will be close and
that the winner of the greatest
prize in the giving. o( the people,
be he Pretf dent. Wilson or Chart
les E. Hughes,', will secure the
presidency .by.'. narrow- margin
The presidential candidates left
latt hieht fcrtheff JiohWb to cast
their votes today. President Wil
son will mark his ballot in an en
gine house in Princeton. Mr.
Hughes will vote in a laundry
chop, rented for the day for a poll
ing booth.
PIVOTAL STATES
It is agreed that the pivotal
States, the main fighting ground
in the last ditch struggles, are
New York, Idiana, Ohio, and Illi
nois. The voters in these States
will decide the presidency.
Just luw any one of the four
will go is problematical. Moth the
campaigners for Wilson and
Hughes claim each of the four.
Chairman Wilcox of the Repub
lican ii.iii.iKil campaign commit
tee, in a last statement of the situ
ation yesterday, saiil that he was
certain of a total of three hundred
anil sixlcen electoral votes for the
Republican nominee, forty-eight
more than enough to), elect.
Ivlr. Hughes called at the Re
publican headquarters yesterday
and personally thanked the work
ers. Democratic Claims
Cou n lc ring on the announce
ment of the Republicans, Vance
McCormick, chairman of the De
mocratic national campaign com
mittee, announced that the Demo
cratic cam-ass had shown that Mr.
Wilson vvi'I receive three hun
dred and sixty-four electoral col
lege votes, while Private Secre
tary Tumulty, from the White
House, sent out an estimate that
IVerddcnt Wilson will win with a
majority in the electoral college
of one hundred and twenty-one
votes.
Secretary of Commerce Rcdlicld,
after touring Ohio, Indiana, Wis
