London, Nov. 7. -Continued ac
tivity oa practically all fronts, with
severe lighting at some points, has
marked the past 24 hours. At all
(jut one or two points the entente
allied armies developed strong offen
sives, with what appears to have been
gratifying success In some Instances.
Since the partially successful Ger
man counter-attacks, which for a time
checked French and British storming
lines thst had swept Into German
trenches along the Bom me, there has
been no claim from Berlin to refute
London snd Paris war office state
ments that the terrain captured has
been consolidated.
Although Infantry operations on
the west front died down late yester
day, there was heavy artlllerylng, the
English night report mentioning spe
cially heavy shelling of the British
front. The Germans appear to have
consolidsted their regained ground
In the region of Butte de Warlen
court, where counter-attacks drove
the Hrltlsh from hard-won trenches.
In Pierre Vaast wood French troops
during the night continued combing
out the Germana who were not ex
pelled, or captured during the first
rushes.
The Koumanlana apparently have
failed to retrieve their defeat in the
Predeal region of Roumanla, where
the Austro-Germana captured Laomu
heights, but they seem to have main
tained the positions won In the Dob-
rudja region, where they drove the
enemy out of three villages.
