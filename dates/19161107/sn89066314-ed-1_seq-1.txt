mous election has there been such a
complete lack of indication which way
the straw blows. The most unusual
eleventh-hour development in connec
tion with the election was in the bet
ting. Wall Street prides itself on pick
ing winners. Up to midnight, the odds
were strongly with ughes, but today
they opened with less advantage to the
Republican nominee, almost at even
money. The odds are still slightly in
favor of Hughes. Messages from the
mid-western states indicated the same.
However, in Cleveland Wilson ruled
as the favorite.

Mr. Voss is at present making in

fall and is recording the ability and
adapatability of the workers to va
rious kinds of work
"This classification will work to
the good of both the student and the
employer," said Mr. Voss, "for it will
enable a student to become more pro
ficient in some particular line of work
than when he is shifted from one form
of labor to another."
The list of students obtaining work
through the bureau ranges all the
way from striplings in knee trousers
attending the preparatory' school to
graduate students, and Imarried men
with families.
The kinds of work make(up not an
altogether prosaic list Here are a
few: stenography, waiting tables, fir

flower beds, cleanlpg ards. waxing
windows, washing floors and taking
care of children during the social and
entertainment season. One young man
had the task, of tracking the sweet
heart of an old admirer now living in

The second group, scene and aria "Der

on the program. "Traume," by Wag-i
