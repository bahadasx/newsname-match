March 4 began rising early today.

The most unusual eleventh hour de
velopment in connection with the
election was in the betting. Wan
street prides Itself in having always
picked a winner. Up to midnight the
cdds have favored Hughes. But to
day they opened with less advantage
to the republican nominee—almost at
ven money. At the Waldorf, Tex
Hlckard, discarding his role of fight
promoter to act as betting commit
ikraer, couldn't place money except
at even odds. More republican cash

wu estimated that at least $7,000,000

change hands on the verdict of
(lie voters today—probably the largest
mm that has ever been wagered on a
presidential election.
But if the odds here were slightly
to favor of Hughes, messages from
certain middle western cities indi
cited complete reversal. Cleveland,
for Instance, said Wilson ruled the
tworite.
The American people may expect
complete returns from two or three
small hamlets in Massachusetts
