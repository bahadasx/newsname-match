from a, staff correspondent of the
Associated ITessl. The battle today
in the district 'between Saillisel an 1
St. Pierre Vaast wood was fought
without the assistance of aeroplanes.
The wind blowing SO miles an hour
prevented the planes from ascending
nncl consequently the artillery fire
from a hundred German batteries ns
well as from the French and British
was uncontrolled aerially. Every
Inch of the battle ground was a dan
ger spot and the corresisindent of
the Associated Press and other cor
respondents were compelled to take
shelter In a dusout.
When the French infantry attacked
a powerfully defended series of
trenches with trench mortars and
grenades thev found a strong par

in a body with their officers, more
than five hundred running at a rac
ing pace into the French lines and
for two miles and a helf to the
rear accompanied by only half a
dozen French puns. It was a strung'

enfilading each other and proved a
most difficult nrohlem for the French.
