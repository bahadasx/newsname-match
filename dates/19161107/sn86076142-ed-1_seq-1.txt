STATE CAMPAIGN AND THE
MEN AND ISSUES INVOLVED
Estimates Are That Fifteen Thou
sand Women Are Casting Their
First Votes Today
(Hy Assoclaled Preaa.)
RENO, Nov. 7. Nevada had one of
the most heated campaigns this year
in the history of the state, with the
chief fight centered on the election
of United Stales senator to succeed
Key Plttnian, Democratic incumbent.
There ware three senatorial candi
dates in the field, Key Plttnian, Demo
crat; Samuel Piatt, Itepublican, and
A. Grant Miller, Socialist.
Plttnian made his campaign on his
record during the last four years, he
having been elected to fill the unex
pired term of the late Senator George
8, Nixon. He appealed for votes on
the plea of having consistently sup
ported all of the Wilson policies and
defended his bill providing for a land
grant of 7,000,000 acres.
' Samuel Piatt, the Republican can
didate, attacked the Human land
grant bill, claiming it was dosigned to
aid the rich man and deprive the poor
homesteader of Nevada lands, lie
ilso attacked the Wilson policies,
particularly the Underwood tariff bill.
For representative In congress, E.
E. Roberts, Republican Incumbent,
Bought re-election, standing on his
record as a friend of labor, his work
in the national House of Representa
tives in the last three terms, his
efforts in behalf of the Susan B.
Anthony amendment and his record
as a protectionist. K. E. Calne, the
Democratic nominee, appealed for
votes on the strength of favoring the
policies of President Wilson. The
Socialist fight was centered on the
senatorial contest, but little attention
being paid to the other offices.
Estimates were that about 15,000
women would vote at the election this
year. Various women's organizations
conducted vigorous campaigns against
Wilson and the Democratic candi
dates for United States senator and
representatives ' in congress. Miss
Anne Martin, national chairman of
the National Woman's party, and
Miss Mabel Vernon, national secre
tary, toured the state in opposition
to the Democratic candidates.

TO BE CHARGED
WITH MURDER
Republican enthusiasm was at high '
tide last evening when the final rally
of the campaign was held. Despite
the inclemency of .the weather, a
huge crowd gathered at Republican
headquarters and, led. by the Tonopah
military band, divided Into two
squads, marched down Main street
to the depot and countermarched to
Brougher and thence to the Airdome.
Red lights glowed along the way and
cheers from the ranks testified to
the patriotism of the marchers.
The Airdome waV filled with an
attentive and enthusiastic audience.
The various candidates made brief
remarks and were each given an
ovation. Then came the address of
the evening, which was delivered by
Hon. Hugh H. Brown. In scholarly
manner he- summed up the issues of
the campaign and paid tribute to
the party and its nominees. Thus
was brought to a close one of the
most harmonious and determined
campaigns of any party in any county
at any time in the history of the
State of Nevada.

il VOTING IN THE GITY PRECINCTS
Owing to the Increase in tbe regis
tration, .welled largely by the women
voters, it aS found necessary to
enlarge the number of precincts to
even. This created some confusion,
dKDte the fact that the Bonanza
published the boundary lines of each
and named the polling places. Scores
of voters today found themselves "In
the worng pew." Further confusion
"luring the first hour that the polls
ere open was due to the fact that
a1 number of the precincts the men
and women tn charge were having
their first experience as election offi
cials and were further handicapped
ny the cumbersome election law that
the late lamented legislature foisted
on the, state, but the confusion was
peeflily at an end and the election
folng off very smodlhly.
There was an early morning rush

at all the polling places, the booths
being kept filled for the first hour,
when there was slower balloting until
noon, when the rush was on. The
election officers figure that they will
have their bUBlest time after the
miners come off the day shift. It is
impossible at this time to tell how
the tide of battle will turn, but the
Republicans are expressing greater
oonfldence as the hours pass.
At the latest moment before the
Bonanza went to press with Us early
edition, the following votes had been
cast in the several precincts, the num
ber registering also being given:
Precinct No. 1, 126 cast, 248 regit

After a week or more of doubt con
cerning ' operations lit the Dobrudja
region of Rumania, where the Teu
tonic allies had been marching almost
unimpeded northward from the Black
sea to the Danube, comes the report
that the Rumanians, have taken the
offensive, probably aided by Russians,
and compelled the enemy to retreat
at several points., ,
On the Transylvania- front, how
ever, the Rumanians in the Jiul val
ley, who for some time had been
holding the upper hand over the Aus-
tro-Germans, forcing them to give
ground, have now been stopped, the
Teutons having brought up reinforce
ments. In the Predeal pass region,
after heavy fighting the Rumanians
also have met with a reverse, being
compelled to retreat after long and
stubborn battles.
All along the battle line in France
between the Sum me and Ancre rivers,
the Germans are tenaciously disput
ing attempts by the British and
French to gain further ground. Ber
lin says that in Sunday's fighting over
a front of 12 miles, the French and
British Buffered heavy casualties and
won nothing except a local gain In
the St Pierre Vaast wood. London
admits that the British were com
pelled to give back to the Germans
ground the British had previously
won at the Butte de Warlencourt.
In the St. Pierre Vaast wood, how
ever, the French on Monday made a
further advance In the northern part
of the wood, and captured additional
prisoners six hundred of whom were
taken In the fighting of Sunday and
Monday.
Rome reports that the Austrians
are bringing up heavy reinforcements
on the battle front north of Trieste.
Here the Austrians apparently have
taken the offensive, but nowhere have
they been able to regain any of their
lost positions, according to Rome.
Bombardments and small infantry
attacks continue to feature the fight
ing in the Macedonia theater.
London reports that a British sub
marine In the North sea off the Dan
ish coast has scored a hit on a Ger
man battleship of the dreadnaught
class. The amount of damage done
to the battleship is not known by
the British admiralty.

ARIZONA VOTING FOR

PHOENIX, Nov. 7. Besides elect
ing state and congressional officials,
Arizona voters are to pass on twelve
constitutional amendments, one pro
posing to change the initiative and

majority, of the registered vote neces
sary to enactment.
Another amendment abolishes capi
tal punishment and a third tightens
the prohibition lines by removing the
present legal permission for Imports
of Intoxicants for personal use.
Six months, instead of the present
year, is made the legal residence
period necessary for divorce in an
other amendment.
ELECTION FORERUNS
states Michigan, Idaho, Missouri,
Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota
vote on the prohibition question, an
issue that has loomed large on tbe
political horizon for some years past.
The territory of Alaska also votes
on this question. In Arizona an
amendment for the abolition of capi
tal punishment is up for popular
decision.
Woman's part in the presidential
election is one of the outstanding
features. In one quarter of the 48
states women have the vote this year.
The 12 states are Wyoming, Colorado,
Utah, Idaho, Washington, California,
Arizona, Kansas, Oregon, ' Nevada,
Montana and Illinois. The women In
the last six states have the vote for
president this year for the first time.
Tbe interest political leaders take In
this vote can be appreciated when it
is seen that the states involved have
91 electoral votes, a little" more than
one-sixth of the electoral college's
total vote.
One woman, Miss Jeanette Rankin -of
Montana, is running for congress
on the Republican ticket. If she is
elected Montana will be the first
state of the nation to send a woman
to congress. The Progressives of the
first Colorado congressional district
also nominated a woman, Hattle K.
Howard, but she has since withdrawn.
