Based on incomplete returns
from all Topeka precincts in
which the double election board
system is in use, Charles E.
Hughes will carry Shawnee
county by about 3,500 over Pres
ident Wilson. Only a change in
the trend of voters will change
the estimate at this time.
Double Klcction Boards.
Topeka and Kansas are today using
the double election board system for
the first time in the history of the
stale. Intense interest surrounded
the arly counting and returns today
from over the state. In all Topeka
precincts courtesy marked the attitude
of election boards in giving the re
turns for publication. Announcement
of the returns as counted are permit
ted under the law. The state legisla
ture failed to provide a clause in the
election law which would permit with
holding announcements until polls
closed.
Tremendous Vote.
A tremendous vote was polled thru
out the city during the early hours
of the day. In the labor precincts
a heavy vote was cast for President
Wilson. The vote for Wilson, as an
ticipated by political observers, was
more heavy in the railroad districts.
In those districts a heavy vote was
cast this morning, with more to come
during the closing hours.
Strong on West Side.
While President Wilson ran strong
in the labor precincts. Charles E.
Hushes came to the front strong in
the western residence districts. Here
he is believed to have carried a large
woman vote, especially among ardent
national suffrage advocates.
Thruout the day the State Journal
gathered returns from more than
twenty-five precincts in Topeka city.
These returns were bulletined on the
electric bulletin board and held a large
crowd of anxious voters thruout the
day.
It is probable that the total vote in
Shawnee county will be between 20,
000 and 22.000. Should the early re
turns prove a basis for the county's
vote. Hughes's majority would be in
the neighborhood of 3.500.
Suing to Wilson.
A probable heavy swing to Presi
dent Wilson in Topeka was indicated
this afternoon, however, when an
nouncement was made that only n.
small per cent of the Santa Fe shop
vote had been polled during the morn
ing hours. The shops were closed this
afternoon to permit the men to vote.
There are about 3.000 employes in the
shops.
Iloth Parties Busy.
Workers for both Republicans and
Democrats are busy in all sections of
the city this afternoon. Scores of au
tomobiles were called into service and
volunteer workers are hauling hun
dreds of men and women to the va
rious voting precincts. Thruout the
day the voting has been heavy and will
probably establish a record in this
county for a general election.
Hughes- lead on returns is smaller
than the lead which Governor Capper
is holding over W. C. Lansdon, his
Democrat opponent in the gubernator
ial contest. With the 710 Hughes lead
on 3,250 votes. Governor Capper has
a lead of more than 1.100 over Lans
don, altho votes counted for Governor
Capper are below the total for Hushes.
This situation is due to the fact that in
several precincts the tirst count was
merely on presidential candidates.
Votes reported on the governorship
show Capper, 1,844; Lansdon, 715.
Congressman D. R. Anthony, jr.,
has an apparently safe lead in the
congressional race, altho both of his
opponents are Topekans. Rev. Cor
wine. Democrat; and Dr. Eva Harding,
Independent; all Topekans are receiv
ing a good vote in their home town. It
's probable, on the face of returns,
that Anthony will run with Hughes in
the county. He may be stronger.

First Douhle Election Board
Trial in This State.
With clear skies and most favorable
weather conditions, Kansas will today
cast her record vote for state and na
tional candidates. Returns sent to To
peka this1 morning indicated that the
early vote in all of the larger towns
and cities broke all former records
and that a heavy vote is betng polled
in the rural districts. The day's vote
may total 625,000 or 650,000 aa against
528,204 in 1914. The polls will close
in the cities tonight at 7 o'clock. In
rural precincts 6 o'clock is the final
hour for voting.
For the first time in Kansas elec
tions, the state will today test the
double board system. Double election
boards are being used in 634 of the
2,474 precincts of the state. The sec
ond boards reported for service at 10
o'clock this morning. They immedi
ately began a count of the ballots for
state and national candidates. Aa a
result of 'the double board system, re
turns will tonight come to Topeka
several hours earlier than in former
elections.
Leaders of both parties today ex
pressed confidence in results in the
state owing to weather conditions.
Ideal weather conditions were taken
as an indication of a heavy vote in
both city and rural districts and a fair
test of the strength of all candidates.

New Tork. Nov. 7. The flood of
ballots which will sweep either Wil

March 4, began rising early today.
While publicly, sponsors for the Re
publican and Democrat organizations
declare entire confidence in the -ote,
privately they are very much at sea. In.
no previous election has there been
such a lack of indication of which way
the straws blow. The "silent vote"
has been more silent than ever before.
Since the campaign opened about
August 10, there have been half a doz
en different "trends" to public senti
ment, overlapping at times. Today
both sides were claiming the benefit
of such a current.
The most unusual eleventh hour de
velopment in connection with the elec
tion was -in the bettt..g. Wall street
prides itself on having always picked
a winner. Up until midnight the odds
have favored Hughes. But today they
opened with less advantage to the Re
publican nominee almost at even
money.
Republican Cash Predominates.
At the Waldorf. Tex Rickard, dis
carding for the once the role of Tight
promoter to act as betting commission
er, could not place money except at
even odds. More Republican cash was
in evidence than Democratic. It was
estimated that at least $7,000,000 will
change hands on the verdict of the
voters today probably the largest
sum that has ever been wagered on a
presidential election.
But if the odds here were slightly
in favor of Hughes, messages from
certain mid-west cities indicated a
complete reversal. In Cleveland, for
instance. Detting commissioners iiwd
said Wilson ruled the favorite.
The American people may expect
first complete city returns from two
or three small hamlets in Massachu
setts, which have had the proud dis
tinction of being first to be mentioned
in half a dozen elections. (

was cast by 9 o'clock. The polls will
close at 6 o'clock tonight and returns
where voting machines are used wilt
be announced soon afterward.
Special precautions against frauds
were taken both United States and lo
cal officials having made arrange
ment to watch precincts from which
advance reports of alleged proposed
irregularities had been received. The
rapidity of the balloting in many sec
tions of the state indicated that
'straight" tickets were being voted.
