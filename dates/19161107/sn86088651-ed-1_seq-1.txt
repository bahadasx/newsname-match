(By Associated Pressl
Laredo, Texas, Nov. 7. Money
changers operating in the City of
.Mexico and generally in the larger
cities throughout the republic In great
part transact tholr business In the
streets, something after the fashion
of the "curb" brokers In New York
City.
This method has become distasteful
to government officials and steps
have 'recently been takon to confine
financial operations to established ex
changes. In order to enforce this rul
ing, the "coyotes," as tho money
changers are facetiously termed in
Mexico, have been compelled to pay a
heavy tax and confine their opera
tions to offices.
A raid was recently made on a
group of "coyotes" operating in on of
jthe principal streets of Mexico City.
All were arrested and heavily fined.
It has been stated similar raids and
enforcement of exchange operations
being confined to offices will soon be
put Into effect throughout the repub
lic. Requested the Pres'dent to Include
