Louisville, Ky., Nov. 6. "The
tu-
mult and the shouting dies.''
The final rallies of both political
parties in this state have been held,
and ihe national campaign o 191C, so
far as the presenting of their case
before the tribunal of voters is con
cerned, already has passed into his
tory. The champions of Wilson peace
and prosperity having put up a
splendid fight, are confident of the
result.
There is only one menace to demo
cratic success in the state overcon
fidence breeding apathy among the
voters of the party. A warning
against this condition has been issued
n a stafementby Campaign Chairman
Cantrill.

which numerous pre-election fore-

never before have so many straw
votes been taken, nor have they ever
attracted-more interest. This unusu
al interest is due in large measure to
the fact that, by whatever means
these straw votes have been taken,
the trend has been shown to be al
most overwhelmingly for Wilson.
Andthere is no doubt but the demo
crats thereby have been aroused and
enthused, which is so .necessary in
the winning of elections.
There is no reason for a change in
the estimated democratic majority in
this state of around 10,000, as made
last Moaday.
With a rainless day, which .already
is assured in advance, weather bu
reau forecasts, there may be a slight
decrease in the democratic .majority
from the fact that fair weather always
enables more voters in the mountain
counties to go to the polls and the

ADDRESS
Saturday Night Immensely
Pleased the Great
Crowd.
IS AN EXCELLENT ORATOR
And His Speech Was a
ting Close to the Cam
paign.
Fit-
Congressman Heflin, of Alnbamn,
closed the Democratic campaign here
Saturday night in a great speech at
the Union Tabernacle, which was
heard by 3.C0O people. He around
the wildest enthusiasm when he made
the prediction that barring unforeseen
contingencies, the standard bearer of
the Democratic party in a national
campaign at no far distant date will
be United States Senator Ollie M.
James, of Kentucky. Congressman
Heflin followed this with an eloquent
tribute to Senator James as a man de
voted to his native State, its interests
and people, and who is one of the
most stalwart champions of Demo
cratic principles. He said Senator
James stands closer to President Wil
son than anyone, and that thcBresi
dent relies most on his adviceand
counsel.
He paid a high tribute to the un
swerving loyalty of Congressman
uave Kincneioe, who was a repre
sentative . of whom his district can
well be proud.
Mr. Heflin is a most entertaining
and graceful speaker. He held the
close attention of his hearers for
nearly two hours, telling about the
accomplishments of the Democratic
administration under Woodrow Wil
son. Applause at times was deafen
ing. Following the meeting Mr. Helflin
was a guest at a dinner served at Hotel
Latham by leading Democrats of the
city and county.
BOB AGAINST BOB
Which Will Be Elected Mav
or
is a Doubtful
Question.
The race for Mayor between Robt.
T. Stowe and Robt. M. Wooldridge,
is in much doubt. They ran close to
gether in the primary, Stowe getting
500 and Wooldridge 479 votes. The
other three candidates received 600
votes in round numbers and on these
rotes will depend the victory.
It is idle to conjecture as to the out
come, it is a question of popularity.
Both candidates are Democrats and
no issue haves been raised between
iihem. Both white and colored Re
publicans are divided in their sup-
jiortand the attempt to inject the
-liquor question into the race failed,
when it was discovered that the sa-
doenmen themselves were divided in
their allegiance. An uncertain feat
ure is that only about 1G00 votes were
polLed Oct. 21, whereas . there are
2250 now registered. These figures
show that 1200 or 1300 have not ex
pressed themselves between the two
candidates. The man who is elected
will .qualify at once and servo unti
January 1, 1918. The salary is $50 a
month unless the Courts decide that it
can bo raised to $150, the salary paid
commissioners.
