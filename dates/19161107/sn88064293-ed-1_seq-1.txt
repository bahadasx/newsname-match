TALKED IN COURT 45 DAYS
At the conclusion of the hearing
in the case of the Amalgamated
Properties of Rhodesia, Limited,
against the Globe and Phoenix Gold
Mining Company, Limited, Mr. Up
john, K. C., concluded his speech for
the defendants having addressed the
court for forty-five days, the hear
ing having occupied 144 days in all.
He said he was not sure whether he
ought to apologize for the length of
time he had occupied, but he felt he
could not blame himself. He had
more than fifty thousand questions
and answers to go through, five
thousand pages of printed evidence,
and 256 exhibits. In reading, noting
and synthesising the case for the
purpose of placing it be
fore the court he had occupied
eighty-four days, not to speak of the
work done by the other counsel for
+ he defendants.
Justice Eve said Mr. Upjohn's
great speech was bond to provoke a
great deal of criticism, because of
its length. But, having listened to
every word of that speech, he was
well qualified to offer an opinion
upon it, and he wished to express his
appreciation of it as an example of
unwearing industry.—Ex

labor, forage-poisoning, seems
| quite prevalent at the present
i throughout Louisiana, as well
j some of the other states, and is
jing considerable Hms among
j animals.
Unfortunately it is a very fatal j
ailment when once it attacks the ani- j
mal, but on the other hand it is one |
ihat may be prevented if only own-1
trs were a little more'familiar with i
it. Those who have had to do with
the disease have observed that cli- :
matic conditions seem to play »in im- j
portant part in its occurrence and it j
seems most prevalent during seasons j
of sunshine and showers in the warm <
parts of the year which are favorable j
to the development of vegetable, and
to molds or fungi of different kinds,
which are also vegetable in their na
ture.
Such climatic conditions we have
spoken of seems to have been preva- j
lent locally, at least, if not generally j
throughout the state, and the ani-1
mais attacked are usually those that
have been grazing on good pastures,
but where the grasses have been at
tacked by some of the numerous
fungi. Numerous investigations have

line of work. However, be this as it
may, there seems little question that
'he disease is in some way associated
with the feeding of moldy grain, es
pecially during the winter season,
and of blighted grasses during the
summer, under elimatic conditions
such as we have alluded to, as a com
plete change of feed will usually
stop the disease right away.
And while the trouble might be
with the blighted grasses at the pres
ent time, it may, later on, be with
the corn which has been grown dur
ing the hot, showery weather, and
fed from the crib in a moldy state.
Following this short explanation,
we would urgently warn horse and
mule owners to keep their animals
from grazing on long, luxuriant pas
tures where there is any chance of
blight or mold, and feed them on
good, clean hay for the present.
A large percentage of the ani
mals attacked die, and cures -are
not to be depended upon. But the
dieease may be prevented by elimi
nating the cause, that is keeping the
animals away from the blighted pas
tures, and later, cutting out the
moldy corn when fed from the crib

OF WORLD'S TRADE
New York, Nov. 6.—The foreign
trade of the United States for the
calendar year 1916 will approximate
$8,0(10,000,000, or about one-fifth
of the entire international trade of
the world, according to estimates
made public here today by the for
eign trade department of the Nat
ional City Bank.
It will be 50 per cent greater than
in 1915, and double that of 1914.
Excess of exports over imports will
approximate $3,000,000,000 against
$1,786,884,000 in 1915, ' $324,348,
000 in 1914 and $691,422,000 in
1913.
Complete figures for the com
merce of the entire country in the
nine months ending with September
are at hand, as also those of this
port, which is accepted as an index
of the entire country's trade for
October. Figures for the nine months
ending with September show a total
commerce of $5,780,000,000 against
3,833,000,000 in the corresponding
period of 1915 and $2,877,000,000
in the nine months of 1914.
