WILL YOU COOPERATE |
TO GET A CREAMERY?
Only four creameries in South Carolina.
In 1913 Mr. W. 'W\ Long, direc-!
tor of extension work in South Carolina
conceived the idea of establishing
cooperative creameries for the
^ fnwmAw. /sP +Vi A C f O f A f
UCIlfcUlt, U1 LUC laillJCltj UL LUC oiau.
The first one was established at Clemson
College that same year making
\ only 500 lbs of butter the first month.
? This creamery has succeeded even beyond
the dreams of the originators
and it is now making and selling for
its patrons 12,000 pounds of butter per
month.
Small farmers near the creamery
-who once had to buy supplies on time
with which to make a crop are now
?el;ing cream from 3 to 5 cows and
getting a monthly check large en- j
ougb to run his farm on a cash sys- j
tem besides be nas tne Dy-proaucts. i
manure and skim milk to use at borne, j
This of course requires some time and |
labor but does not curtail the production
of field crops. Thier yield
in a few years will be increased' because
of the increased fertility of the
soil from manure of the cows.
This creamery has demonstrated the
fact that the creamery can be made !
a success in any part of South Caro-'
liaa.
Srartanbursr has thp next largest!
in the State from the point of production,
producing 8,000 pounds per
month.
Darlington and Rock Hill each have
one, producing not quite so much as
Spartanburg.
But the point I wish to make is this:
If a creamery is a good thing for
other sections of the State, would itj
not be a good thing for the people!
of Newberry county also? If it enables |
the poor farmer in other sections of i
the State to run his business on aj
cash basis would it not do the same!
thing for the poor farmer of New-'
herry county? If it enables farmers'
or gooa circumstance m omer sections
of thf- State to make money would it
not do the same thing for this class
*of farmers in Newberry county? It
will also enable the business man
wheii he wants a pound of butter for
3iis table to get the best right at his
own home.
I. as demonstration agent am in aj
position to know the people of New-j
berry county, possibly better than any i
one else in the county. I know that'
we have as good people in Newberry
county as any where in the State and
I feel that the best is not too good i
for them. I feel that we need a
creamery In Newberry county and we j
need the cooperation of bankers, mer-j
chants and farmers in this matter.
It will require about a $4,000 capi-i
tal stock to put up a first class cream-;
cry. It will require at least 400 cows i
making from 15 to 30 pounds of but-;
ter each per month to begin with. Now j
7 am going to ask that every man in
^Newberry county or nearby in adjoin-!
ing counties who is interested in sell- j
mg cream taxe a census or tne num-.
toer of cows available, and either come
or send representatives to Prosperity
on November the 16th and take up :
the matter with W. W. Long, who will j
at that time explain exactly how the
thing can be done. There will be only
2 or 3 more creameries established!

and I am very anxious to get one of
these in Newberry county. If all will
cooperate we will get the creamery. |
Will you do it?

wishes to take this opportunity of! J
calling their attention to the explra-!(

November 11th, after which time the *
