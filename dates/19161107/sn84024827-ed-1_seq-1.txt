SMITH 11DS
UP CAMPAIGN
IN BURST OF
GLORY
Arizona Senator Out for Demo
cratic Comrades, Stirs Voters
to Wild Enthusiasm at Royal
Theatre in Bisbee.
PRAISE FOR HUNT
IS ENTIRELY ABSENT
Rest of Ticket Is Roundly Com
mended by Senator in Eloquent
Manner Several Others Also
Talk to Iarge Crowd.
Although ignoring the claims of
George W. P. Hunt to re-election ex
cept on a plea of loyalty to party,
United States Senator Marcus A.
Smith endeared himself to the hearts
of a Royal Theatre audience last
night by voicing a stirring forecast
of victory for the Democratic party
at today's election. His appeal for
all Democrats to participate in this
victory, however, vfas centered oil
championship of the merits of Presi
dent Wilson, Unitfd States Senator
Ashurst and candidate Fred Sutter
for the State Senate.
Whitney Speaks First
There was considerable uncertainty
during "the day as to whether Senator
Smith would be able to reach Bisbee
in time to address the meeting. The
consequence was that a small assem
blage was present In the Royal Thea
tre to listen to other speakers secur
ed for the occasion. City Attorney
Whitney, who presided, created an
unfavorable impression from the first
Vv launching an attack upon the
Workmen's Compensation amendment j
A majority of the audience were
swift to catch his mis-statement that
a maximum of $4000 to be extended
in seven-year payments was the best
the amendment offered. As a matter
of fact, the amendment provides for
the immediate payment of $5,000 In
case of death, following such proof
as is required in all analogous cases.
It also insures to workmen better
protection in every way. than is en
Joyed under the present statute.
Smith Cheerd Wildly
Shortly after 8 p. m., word sped
throughout the business district that
Arizona's favorite Senator has reach
ed Bisbee and there was a rush to the
Royal Theatre. Nearly every seat
was taken when Senator Smith ap
peared. He was greeted with rounds
of applause and was introduced as I
soon aa Judge Ward, of Phoenix, had
concluded his remarks.
The audience which previously had
been apathetic, immediately took on
an air of interest and before Senator
Smith had concluded his introductory
phrases there was an atmosphere of
old-time Democratic enthusiasm.
The speaker did his best to create
sentiment for Governor Hunt, but he
was quick to recognize the futility of
continued effort. He therefore dis
missed the subject by stating it was
the duty of Democrats to vote for
Hunt because Hunt had been selected
by them in the primaries. : No other
reason, no claim of merit were volun
teered for Hunt's support.
Senator Smith, on the other hand,
advocated the re-election of Henry
Ashurst because, he said, the junior
Senator from Arizona deserved it on
account of loyal work done for the
State.
The speaker was in his best vein
when it came to discussion of nation
al issues. He emphasized the point
that under the Wilson administration
this country has prospered exceeding
ly and that prosperity could continue
in no other way than by the return
of President Wilson to the White
House.
"This is the hour of Democracy's
triumph." he said, "because the party
makes its plea to the electorate on
performances which have placed the
country on a basis that demands the
admiration, not only of our own peo
ple but of the entire world."

IN EVEREST,

Fifty Are Wounded in Melee
Between Rioters on Boat and
Sheriff and Citizens Murder
Charges Out for Many.
(By Review Leased Wire.
EVERETT, Wash., Nov. 6. Respon
sibility for the pitched battle between
250 members of the Industrial Work
ers of the World and a posse of 150
Everett citizens at the city dock yes
terday, in which seven men lost their
lives and fifty were wounded, was
placed upon the men on the boat by
the coroner's jury which investigated
the heath of the two Everett citizens
killed in the riot.
The jury, after a brief deliberation
gave a verdict that Charles O. Curtis
a posseman who was instantly killed,
and Deputy Sheriff Jefferson Bird who
died of his wounds early today, met
death from "gunshot wounds inflicted
by a riotous mob on the steamer Ve
rona at the city dock."
Ail but two of the witnesses called
testified that the first shots came
from the steamer.
Wm. H. Bridges, a deputy sheriff
testified concerning the conversation
that he had with the men on the boat
before the shooting began. Accord
ing to Bridges, the conversation be
tween the sheriff and I. S. W. W. was
as follows:
"Boys, I'd like to speak to the lead
er of the bunch. Who is your leader?
asked Sheriff McRay.
"We are all leaders" shouted the
men on the Verona.
"I want to tell you," McRay replied,
"that you can't land in this town. You
must stay on the boat and go back to
Seattle. You can't land here."
"The hell we can't!" shouted a man
standing in the bow of the boat.
Then; according to Bridges, the man
who spoke last opened fire on the
posse and the shooting became gener
al. Athol Gorrell of Spokane, a Univer
sity of Washington student, who was
visiting here, Harry B. Blackburn, a
night watchman; and Elmer Buehr,
all of whom were members of the citi
zen's committee, were in a critical
condition from the wounds they re
ceived during the fight.
AH of the other injured will recover

Tom Campbell Closes the Most
Strenuous Campaign in His

Theatre Iast Evening.
G. O. P. CANDIDATE
GETS GREAT RECEPTION
Appeals to Voters on Several
Grounds for Their Support at
Polls Delves Into Economic
Policy of Administration.
Assaulting the Democratic fortress
of Cochise county. In a final-effort to j
bring his candidacy for the governor
ship to a successful issue, Thomas E.
Campbell, last night at the Orpheum
Theatre, talked to a crowd that over
flowed the show house many hundreds
strong for over an h'jur. Campbell's
appearance last evening was the sec
ond since his campaign started and
was all the more successful in view
of the appearance of another speaker
on the outside of the theatre during
the speech.
Long before 8 o'clock, the hour for
the meeting to commence, the Or
pheum was packed to its 1400 capa
city. With the arrival of the Repub
lican candidate for governor at the
house hundreds more endeavored to
secure admittance. Isle and all other
space was at a premium and many of
those who were disappointed aug
mented the crowd in front of the
theatre.
Gust Appear.
Edward J. Flanigan presided and in
a few fitting remarks introduced John
L. Gust, Republican candidate for at
torney general, who was unable to
appear in Bisbee on either of the oc
casions when the G. O. P. aspirants
talked to local audiences. The Phoe
nix attorney talked of the duties of
the office, of the extravagance of its
administration and tf his attitude to
ward that office, in case he should be
elected.
McKenzie Denies Stories.
Norman McKenzie, of Lowell, and
candidate for the mine inspectorship,
was next introduced. McKenzie ex
plained several of the stories which
have been going the rounds in the
Warren District and in other mining
camps for several weeks and denied
them in toto.
Campbell's Address.
Tjm Campbell was at his best. He
was talking to a receptive audience
and his address was full of pithy and
pointed remarks relevant to the situa
tion which he discussed. The speech
was, chiefly, devoted to the economic
policies of the state government as it
is now constituted. He answered his
critics with some indication of how
he. If elected governor, would go
about reducing the expense of the ad
ministration of public affairs.
The candidate, in detail, went
through the various departments of
the state government, giving their ex
pense, their contingent funds and what
could be done with them if strict
economy were practiced.
Capital Wanted.
In speaking of the assertion, made
by the present governor that his ad
ministration had encouraged capital
in which was cited the growth of the
bank deposits in the state, Campbell
called attention to the fact that this
was proof of the contention that capi
tal was afraid to venture into Arizona.
He declared that the bank deposits
was not liquid capital and showed
that the people, instead Of investing
it here for homes, or to build big in
dustrial enterprises were hoarding it
in the banks of the state.
He declared that capital must be
given encouragement to come into
Arizona before it would take the
chance. He declared capital only
wanted a fair show and added that
such should be given it.
Industrialism.
Campbell again discussed, briefly,
the industrial situation in the state
and the attacks which have been made
upOn him to the effect that he had
"thrown in" with the liquor interests.

NEW YORK
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Nov. 6. With Gover
nor Whitman and Samuel Seabury,
Republican and Democratic candi
dates for governor, respectively, mak
ing final appeals to the voters of this
city, the New York state campaign
closed tonight only a few hours be
fore the polls opened.
Because New York is regarded as a
pivotal state in the presidential elec
tion, much interest is centered in to
morrow's voting.
Forecasts tonight of the result to
morrow depend on whether the person
ho made the prediction was a Demo
crat or a Republican. Both sides an
nounced that the tide had tumod for
the national ticket they represented.
In Greater New York which the Re
publicans concede will return a Dem
ocratic plurality this year, the Taft
Roosevelt vote together exceeded by
3.092 that cast for President Wilson.
While the Republicans contend the
greater part of those who supported
Roosevelt four years will swing to
Hughes this year, the Democrats
claim the opposite.
Each side predicted today that they
would make gains in the congression-
' al delegation and in the state senate
and legislature.
