UNITED STATES
ACTIONAWAITEB
Little Ground for Protest on
Sinking of the Steamship
Lanao.
REGISTRY QUESTION
Vessel Had Been Sold But Ac
tual Transfer to New Own
ers Not Recorded.
Washington, Nov. 7. In the absence
today of Secretary Lansing and other
high officials of the state department,
the course of the United States In
dealing with the case of the steamer
Lanao sunk by a submarine October
28 off the Portuguese coast was un
dertermined. The department was
without official advices from consular
or diplomatic officers on details of the
sinking. On the strength of press des
patches officials here were inclined to
believe that there is but little ground
for an American protest since tho
ship carried contraband and was
warned and her crew transferred
without accident.
The question of her registry appar
ently is the only troublesome factor.
Despite the declaration of her Ameri
can captain that she was under
American, registry and flew the Ameri
can flag when sunk, the official view
at the department of the commerce
which handles changes of registry,
was that the Lanac had been Bold
by the Findlay Miller Steamship com
pany of Manila to Hans Hannevrg of
Christianla, Norway, and that while
actual transfer to her new owners had
not been made, the sale had gone far
enough legally to tako her from under
the protection of the American flag.
Entitled to Fly American Flag.
Cardiff, Wales, Nov. 7. Captain
Mainland said it had been a moot
question for a long time whether ves
sels under Philippine registry were
entitled to fly the American flag, add
ing: "Many owners of such vessels have
been fined by the United States gov
ernment for flying the American flag,
but a recent decision gave them tho
right to do so."
The captain saved the ship's pa
pers, which he has brought to Cardiff,
showing that the Lanao- was register
ed at Manila and thus entitled to fly
the American colors.

NEW YORK CITY
FOR DEMOCRATS
New York, Nov. 7. Clear skies and
moderate weather promised to bring
out a .heavy vote in New York today
In which at the last presidential elec
tion more than 600,000 .votes were
casL The city, both parties concede,
will as usual in national elections go
Democratic and the question at issue
between them is the size of tho plur
ality. The Democrats claim 100,000,
while the Republicans declare the
Democratic plurality will not be 70,
000 at the most. Both sides claim
Brooklyn, where political results in
past years have shown more variance
than in any other borough of the city.
Long before the polls were open in
some sections of the city men were
in lino waiting to cast their ballots.
Unprecedented State Vote.
The Republican and Democratic
state chairmen both predicted early
today that New York state would
probably cast the heaviest vote in Its
history. Reports from upstate were
that the weather was fine.
At both headquarters these circum
stances were pointed to as favorable
to the success of their respective
tickets. New York state in the last
national election cast 1,587,983 ballots
for tho presidential candidates. The
belief was expressed that these fig
ures would be exceeded today.
Expect Record-Breaking Vote.
Philadelphia, Pa., Nov. 7. Weather
conditions were favorable and the
largest vote in tho history of the state
was expected to be polled throughout
Pennsylvania today. The Republican
leaders declared that Hughes will
havo not less than 200,000 majority,
while the Democrats were sanguine
that President Wilson will receive a
record-breaking vote.
Particular interest was evinced in
the contests for congressmen in a
number of the districts in which close
contests were expected. In addition
to presidential electors, a United
States senator, state treasurer, audi
tor general, four congressmen at large
gressmen and members of the state
legislature.
The polls opened at 7 o'clock and
will closo at 7 o'clock tonight.
Delaware's Factional Finht.
Wilmington, Del., Nov. 7. Chief in
terest in today's election in Delaware
centered in the factionakf ight in the
Republican ranks. United States
Senator Henry A. DuPont and Con
gressman Thomas W. Miller, the reg
ular nominees for re-election, were op
posed by former Congressman Hiram
V. Burton for senator and Edward G.
Bradford for congress, tho last two
named running as independent Repub
licans. The Democratic candidates
for these offices respectively were
Josiah Wolcott and Alfred S. Polk.
Atlanta, Ga., Nov. 7. Fair weather
throughout the south today brought
voters to the polls early and Demo
cratic leaders predicted an unusually
largo vote for the presidential candi
dates. Only in North Carolina and
Tennessee were the Republicans hope
ful of reducing the size of the custo
mary Democratic majority.
Governors and other state officers
are being elected in Arkansas, Florida,
Georgia, North Carolina, South Caro
lina, Tennessee and Texas. In Arkan
sas, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee,

senator is being chosen.
