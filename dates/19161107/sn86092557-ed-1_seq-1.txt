the eleven precincts In Marion county
In an effort to secure votes for the suffrage
amendmont to the state constitution
which Is being voted upon today.
Eighty-eight women working In four I
different shifts are constantly at the )
polls, the women having arisen early
and taken up their posts when the
poles were opened. Tho women give
to each voter a neat card on which is
printed the information that each political
party has endorsed suffrage and
askiug that the men give their sane-1
tion to the movemeut by casting their :
vote for the suffrage amendment.
Tlieso women have had much effect
on the voters, as in many instances
men who were indifferent to the cause,
when asked in to vote for suffrage responded
by casting a favorablo vote.
Marlon county lias boen thoroughly
organized and it is believed the counting
of the ballots tonight will place
Marlon county among the counties piling
up a majority for tiie suffrage
amendment.
In each precinct visited this morn
tng In Fairmont proper, the infonnation
was forthcoming that only a small
majority of the men were voting
against suffrage
In most Instances the women were
given courteous u eminent and shouiu
the men of any one party work as enthusiastically.
earnestly and honestly
as have the women of Fairmont district
today, they would undoubtedly
achieve victory for their candidates.
Many of the women at the polls when
interviewed by a reporter expressed
their sincere belief that the chivalry
and fair mindedness of the men of
West Virginia would bring them victory
at the polls.
A man nosscssinc keen insight into
the suffrage situation stated today
that ho believed uue would roll
up at least S.000 majority for women's
suffrage.
The weather conditions were ideal
today and at several of the poling I
places tile women remained all day
outside the buildings in their efforts
to see that each man voting he given
the card asking tor ? -> vote.
Not only In Fairmont district are the
women working but in the more remote
districts of tho bounty women
arc working hard to influence the men
to cast their ballot for suffrage and
what is true ot Marion county is practically
true of each county in' the state.

("By Associated Fressl
NEW YORK, Nov. 7?Fair weather
is general throughout the country except
In the upper Mississippi valley
and western Colorado, accompanied by
agreeable temperature brought out
voting hosts early today. Reports at
noon from practically all sections indicated
a heavy vote had been cast
and some points iudicated that the
bulk of vote was in before 10 a. m.
The big early vote was something
of a surprise to politicians and caused
much conjecture. New Ashford.
Mass., a small Massachusetts town had
the distinction of making the first returns.
The towns has 23 voters this
year and when the polls closed at 10
o'clock the count was Hughes 10 and
Wilson 7.
All New England states in early reports
dwelt on the heavy early balloting.
Providence reported that throughout
the state it was the heaviest on
record.
New York state and other middle
Atlantic states all reported an unusually
large early vote aud similar reports
came from the west and'south
Indicating keen and even eager interest
everywhere.
Political observers are in doubt as
to just when the election results will
be known. They incline to the opinion
that it will be later than in recont
years because of the complex situation
resulting from the great number of
women voting.
"The fight is won. Wo have Republican
weather and it's all over but the
shouting," said Chairman Wilcox at
noon after hearing the report of um
progress of the voting. He declared
that the result of returns at New Ashford.

Riot and racket, threats and punches
passed to and fro at the Miller
Bchool this morning, when Dan Harris,
colored, pretty much soused, and Constahlo
Michaels vouched for 75 negroes
as being residents of the precinct
although they probably never had been
In that precinct In their lives before.
Justice of the Peace M. It. Musarove.
gumshoeing his way into a room in
the rear of the voting room wsb writing
out affidavits as fast as the negroes
could be driven In to him. He
knew they wore not telling the truth,
ho said, but that it was none of his
business if they were to lies.
The law calling for a apace of 60
feet between outsiders and the polls
was being violated by Squire Musgrove.
When a few Republicans demanded
that this be stopped Hearn
Abbott, W. S. Black and others who
were running the pollB and caring
for tho Democrats started a rumpus.
A few blows were struck but knowing
that even though thoy were allowed to
disobey the law tlie? were as accesible
for punches as anyone else they
Anally gave in and Squire Musgrove
scenting trouble raised hlB band and
said: "In the name of the State of
West Virginia I demand that order
be in the house."
As was the case at the Court House
these negroes were voted though even
half of them when spoken to said that
they had not been in the Btnte for
48 hours. There were between 75
and 100 of them and Leslie Michaels
and Dan Harris, colored, were the
ones who Btood good for them.
At the Court Houso when these
same negroes wore herded In to vote
a Republican who apparently ia not
afraid of the powers that be in the
county, made an effort to challenge
their votes but Charlie Powell rushed
to the negroes' rescue and sent
them In with now affidavits.
Charlie Powell and A. H. Hefnor,
Republican, called each other a few
hot names but no blows were struck.
It Is rumored that these negroes will
all flock to some polls probably at the
fire houso on the East side a few
minutes before the polls close and
vote the third tlmo before any Republicans
can be summoned to challenge
them.
At the Court House the purchase
of votes was carried on with such little
concealment thqt no one could remain
about the polls for half an hour
without understanding clearly what
was going on. Here Tom Deveny was
the paymaster and as the negroes and
others who voted for a price turned
away from the ballot box after "delivering
the goods" Tom took them
Into either the office of the sheriff
or the office of the DlBtrlct Attor-|
ney and paid. It la not known whether
Haggerty waa an actual witness
ot any transfer of monoy or not. Deputy
Sheriff Thomas, however, spent
the most of the^pornlng in the sheriff's
office and was present when Deveny
took negroes there.
That the Gang figured It was very
much In need pf these Illegal votes
la shown by the fact that there was
no haggling over the price In any case.
The negroes apparently were offered
more money than they expected at the
very start The Republicans made no
effort to find out what the prevailing
price for votes was, but It was the
general opinion about the court house
that a "good nigger" could get $10
and no questions asked.
For the past Ave days Connty Clerk
Martin has been busy Issuing transfers
for the use of Illegal -voters and
many of the negroes who have been
voted at the court house and Miller
school are In possession of these papers
on the strength of them they
can vote again In any precinct In the
county.
Eliminating the bunch of negroes
and the trouble arising from their Illegal
voting, the polls all over the city
were quiet Early In the day, about
10 o'clock, the polls about the city averaged
one third the total vote which
experienced politicians regard as being
a very good turn out
Democrats and Republicans alike at
noon prophesied that victory was with
