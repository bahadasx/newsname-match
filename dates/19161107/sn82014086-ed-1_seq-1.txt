WHITMAN AND SEABURY
MADE FINAL APPEALS.
Neither Professes Any Misgivings
Concerning the Outcome,
New York. Nov. 6. With Governor
Whitman and Samuel Seabury, candi
date for governor, making final appeals
to the voters of this city,, the New
York state campaign closed tonight
only a few hours before the polls
opened. The head of each stae ticket
Joined his campaign managers in pro
fessing serene confidence in the out
come of the balloting.
Because New York ia considered a
pivotal state in the presidential elec
tion, chief popular Interest in tomor
row's voting centered in the contest
between President Wilson and Charles
E. Hughes. Votens will be called upon,
however, to elect a complete state
ticket in addition to governor and
United States senator.
Forecasts tonight depended upon
whether the person who made the pre
diction was a democrat or a republi
can. Both sides agreed that the tide
would be turned for the national
ticket by those who voted as progres
sives four years ago. The combined
Taft and, Roosevelt vote in 1912 was
45,680, as compared with 655,573 for
Wilson. In Gi-eater New York, which
the republicans concede will return a
democratic plurality this year, the
Taft and Roosevelt vote together ex-
:lais
RIVALS
ceeded by 3,092 that cast for Wilson.
While the repuolicans contend that
the greater portion of those who sup
ported Roosevelt four years ago will
swing to Hughes this year, the demo
crats scoff at their claims. It was
asserted at democratic state head
quarters that a careful canvass o
every county in the state indicates
that serious inroads will- be made by
President Wilson upon the normal re
publican pluralities up-state and that
the democratic plurality in Greater
New York will p more than offset the
republican lead down to the Harlem
river.
On the eve of tomorrow's election
the chairmen of both the republican
and - democratic state committees
claimed victory by at least 100,000.

DENIAL MADE BY
BRITISH ADMIRALTY
Of Order Not to Save Survivors of
German Submarines.
London, Nov. 6. 10.27 p. m. The ad
miralty tonight in a published com
munique again denies that it ever is
sued orders that survivors of German
submarines need not he rescued. The
communique states that the German
press "is trying to make capital out of
what they describe -as a second Bara
long case, possibly in order to incite
American opinion against Great Brit
ain or as a pretext for an unrestrain
ed submarine campaign.
The communique cites the alleged
facts of the case, showing that a Brit
ish auxiliary flying a neutral flag on
September 24, 1915, approached a
German submarine in the western
channel, engaging in sinking a British
merchantman. When within range
the auxiliary hoisted a white ensign
and fired o nand sank the submarine
and then rescued the crew of the
merchantman from their boats. When
this was done she also rescued two of
the submarine's crew who had climbed
into a drifting boat.
The communique claims that the use
of a neutral flag was justifiable, as
shown by the German practice in the
case of the Moewe and in other in
stances and say3 that "nobody but a
German could base an allegation of
brutality on the lapse of a few min
utes between the rescue of .Britishers
and Germans."

delegation representing organizations
interested in relief work in Germany,
Austria-Hungary, Poland, Russia, Ar
menia, Syria and other countries.
The committee gave to the presi
dent a petition in which it wa sstated
that "the gifts of the American peo
ple, while generous and constant, are
still incommensurate to meet the de
mands of our brethren in distress,

yet by no means proportional to our
resources and are not an adequate ex
pression of national unselfishness."
The committee left Shadow Lawn
under the impression that their request
would be granted and that the presi
dent already had: something of the
kind in mind.
