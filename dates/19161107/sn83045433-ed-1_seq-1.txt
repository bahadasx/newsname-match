'iew York. Nov. C.-Pre-election betting

to the even mark.
Betters who have watched the situation
closest were not so certain over the out

Wall Street-strong in Its belief that
Hughes will be eleced-wavered. The
same uncertainty pervaded the hotels

11M.00, mostly at 10 to 8. Another broker
named Oppenhelin said he had, placed

Today's betting throughout presaged a

the betting has been an accurate indica
tion of the outceme-especially the wager

sentiment of a wide-spread territory that

A phenomenal amount of money was
bet during the day. It was variously said
it, would exceed S1,00.000. This brings
the estimated total up to between 15,00,
900 and $7.000,00, an amount more than

Tracing the trend of betting back shows
Hughes. after his nomination, was 18 to 6
favorite, with Wilson backers wanting
better odds- Eventually Hughes support
ers gave I to 6 and a great many wagers
had been made at 2 to 1. Two weeks ago
the odds began shortening and oon ,the
even mony mark was reached. Then the
hedging began. Thome who had 2 to I
beta on Hughes "covered up" in the hope
of aving some of their money.

By WILLIAM BAYARD HALE.
(laternational News servies.)
Berlin (wireless via SayvHile). Nov. S.
It is imposible to secure from any one
in authority the slightest hint that the
10f'man government favors eiher candi
date in the United States Presidential
election. The fact is that the govern
ment has not only preserved a correct
attitude of strict aloofness. but actually
has no preference.
It regards all the controversies with
America as things of the past and fore
sees no difficulties in the future. It
has no desire to see President Wilson
punished and has no particular expec
tation either from him or Mr. Hughes.
1 can well understand that England
Is Interested in view of Its present con
troversies and the larger demands on
American patience which it must make
in the- future, but so far as Germany'
Is concerned the results of the election
will be heard with disinterested attention.
