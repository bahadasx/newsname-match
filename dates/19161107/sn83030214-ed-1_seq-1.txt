Washington, Nov. 6. British inter
vention in Mexico is feared by the
Mexican government, it was learned to?
day in Administration quarters. Gen?
eral Carranza has been advised that
there i? danger that Great BriUin may
land troops at Tampico to guard the
oil properties there from possible at?
taek by revolutionists. The Tampico
oil fields constitute the chief source of
fuel for the British fleet.
It wai learned also that the Car?
ranza government is expecting a I'-boat
campaign otT Tampico with the object
of blockadmg the oil traffic from that
port That the British government also
,4 apprehensive of thi* is indicated by
a request that the State Department
warn Carranza and ask him to protect
Mexico'.- neutrality.
Administration officials have no in?
formation to contirm General Car
ranza's fear that Great Britain plans
to land troops at Tampico. It is be?
lieved. moreover, that the British gov?
ernment would not do this without con
.ulting Washington. lf, however, the
fuel suprlv of the British fleet is ac?
tually in danger the British govern
ment might, it ll adm.tted, be forced to
di-regard the Monroe Doctrine.
The Mexican rebels are not operat.ng
in the vicinity of Tampico at present,
lt li understood, though since the war
began there have been persistent re?
port* of a German intrigue with the
bandits to attaek Tampico. It is be?
lieved oon.ible ,hat General Carran*.
has definite information concerning
such a olot. aaad that. therefore. he
fears British interference with the pur?
pose of preventlng it.
Mexico's attitude toward the British
warning against a submarine campaign
was clearly set forth in a note from
I'andido Aguilar. Secretary for Foreign
*ffair?, to the British Foreign Office
to-dav. Setior Aguilar's commur.ication
wu. fareastic. He objected, first of all,
to the fact that Great BriUin had made
it* representations through the State
Department here in?tead of directly to
Mexico City. He said further that the
Mexican government could be depend
ed on to look out forSts own neutrality,
and that if Great Britain had any con?
cern in the matter of the I'-boats the
best way to handle the subject was to
"prevent the submarines from leaving

BULLET HITS BOY;
MINISTER IS HELD
Harlem Pastor Accused of
Firing at Lads Whose
Shouts Annoyed Him
The Rev. Hugo Holmgren, for twen?
ty-four years pastor of the Swedish
, Chapel, which is connected with St.
Bartholomtw's ("hurch, at 121 and IU
East ISTtl Street, was arrested last
right at his home, UI East 127th
, Street, charged with having shot and
' seriously wounded a ten-year-old boy.
1 If is alleged that the minister fired a
'? levolver from the basement window of
I his home at a group of boys playing
I ?cross the street, whose shouts had an?
noyed him.
The lads, According to the police, had
no warning that the minister was about
I to shoot at them. They say he raised
thi window quietly and blazed away
i withcut a word. James Long, of 164
1 Fast 127th Street, fell, shot in the side.
When the lead was removed by Dr.
Janoff, who came in an ambulance from
! Harlem Hospital, it was found the bul
1 let had been split in half. The police
i believe it struck an iron railing in
j front of the minister'.*) house before
1 hitting the boy, which probably saved
I hi* life.
Policeman O'Callaghan, on duty near
the pastor's home, heard the shot.
I When he reached the minister'* house,
! he says. he found him caimly raking
' dead leaves in his back yard. ln his hip
pocket, O'Callaghan says, was the re
i volver, with two loaded shells still in it.
The policeman said Mr. Holmgren ad
mitted that he had fired the shot be?
cause he disliked the boys' noi.ie.
The minister 4vas taken to the East
126th Street station, charged with
i felcnious assault. Later h_ was re
I moved to Bellevue Hospital for obser
? vation.
The clergyman's wife was in the
kitchen of his home at the time of the
shooting. She told the polio* he did

MARKET REFLECTS
FAITH IN HUGHES
Two to One Wagered He
Will Carry New
York State
Although the betting odds shifted
- iBUWBBt in Wilson's favor yesterday,
Wall Street, which prvdes itself on al?
ways picking the wir.ner in a Presi
dential year, still demanded a premlum
to bet on Wilson. Hughes continued
the favorite in active betting. Stake
holders estimated that $1,000,000 was
wagered in the financial district dur?
ing the day. In other parts of the
country laying no claim to omniscience
in the matter of Presidential elections
many bets were made at even money.
N'owhere did the odds favor Wilson.
Betting was lively in the uptown ho?
tels last night, the prevailing odds be?
ing 10 to 9 and 10 to 8 on Hughes.
In addition to the fact that yester
days closing odds on Mr. Hughes
ranged from 10 to 9 to 10 tr. 8, with
some betting done at 10 to 7, bankers
and brokers pointed to yesterday'*
stock market as an indication of a Re?
publican vietory. Issues that would be
directly affected by a protective tariff
were extremely buoyant and, led by
Steel common, closed from one to three
points up.
Many New Bettors
The manager of an important Stock
Exchange tirm reported that he had
placed more money on this year's elec?
tion for merchants who had not made
it a habit to bet than ever before in
his forty years' experience in the finan?
cial district. He said that his clients
had wagered at least $12,000 on Mr.
Hughes at odds ranging from '-0 to 6"?i
to 10 to 8.
A large amount of Tammany money
appeared on the curb and offerings
from this source were declared to be
! largely responsible for the hhortenlng
j of the Hughes odds at 3 o'clock. M
1 one time reports were current that Wil?
son supporters were willing to take
even money, but it was learned later
that no real money was placed at those
figures.
The curb market yesterday re?em
bled a big betting ring more than a
market place where unlisted securities
are dealt in. Practically two-thirds of
the dav's business was said to have
been done by the stakeholders. Many
wagers were reported to have been
quietly placed in the lobby of the
Stock Exchange. In addition to the

Cheering News for Repub?
licans from Wisconsin
and Washington
By STEVENSON H. EVANS
Predirtions are without value to?
day. Probably before 10 o'clook to
night the world will know. Sixteen
million men and women will hava
be-jrun to decide whether "safety
first" and "weasel words" are to bt*
continued a? the policy of the United
btates before many New Yorker*
! are out of bed this mornina;.
When certain knowledge is so near
attainment no one wanta to write
predictions. No one wants to read
them. But information received last
niffht makes necessary a revision of
The Tribune's estimate of the elec

First of all. the State of Idaho Ifl

I clamped. There it will *tay. It mean*
1 only four votes, and WiUon needs them
far more than does Hughes. but in the
interest of accurate forecasting it ifl
impossible to be ganeroua.

Add also to the certain Hughes col

j tainty that Hughes will win in Dela
' ware. the Republican margin of safetv
is broadened.
There is small need of piling up tha
; evidence that the State of New York
, will go to Hughes. But one piece of
' news received last night from Buffalo
contained a jolt for the people who hsd
decided that the "labor vote" could ba

trial plant* in Buffalo. where ara em
\ tloytd more than 4.000 highly paid attd
highlv intelligent union men. was com
pletelr nolled. Twentv-eight hundred
Hughes votes were counted.

Cheer front WUcoflaln
The Democrats yesterday, except fai
' publication, stopped claiming New
York, New Jersey and Connecticut But
they continued a atrong claim to ?
consin and said that Iaa Follette wa?
certain to "come through for Wood?
row." While it does seem probabla
that Wisconsin, like Obio, leans toward
President Wilson. still, on election e\t
more cheerful intelligence for the Re?
publicans came from the Badger State.
Guy 0. Goff, of Milwaukee. chairman
of the Hughes Alliance for the state,
reported that he had on his books a
personally signed enrolment of I I
Republicans, Democrats and Progre
sives, who were voting for Hughes.
When it is considered that the total
1 vote in Wisconsin is less than 400,000
and that Mr. Goff made no effort to get
the Stalwart Republicans, who are cer?
tain to vote for all Republican candi?
dates except La Follette, the impor?
tance of an enrolment of that aixe 18
; apparent. In addition Mr. Goff report
1 ed that he had 9,600 worker* all over
! the state, and there waa no doubt thfl
full Hughes vote would be polled.

From Puget Soond came information
which would lead to the conclusion that
Vance C. MeCormiek i* attempting lar?
cenv when he files a claim on the Stata
of Washington. The Hughes Allisnca

of 73,000, within '.''i.OOO of the total
1 vote Wilson received in 191.' E. C.
Hughes, Washington chairman of tha
Hughes AiUncc, reported tl.at Hughes
would have a majority there of not
Ie** than 20.000.
If the electoral votes of Wnron?ia
and U a.-hington be added to the Re

l to lose even lllinots.
