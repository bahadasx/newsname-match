Wilson Declares He Believes the

Long Branch, N. J., Nov. 6. Presi

the campaign to the men who have
worked to bring about his je-olection.
The telegram sent to every state and
county chairman in the country, fol
lows:
"The fight Is won, I fully believe;
though I take this means of urging
you to renewed exertions and vigil
ance to see that belated efforts to con
fuse the public judgment do sot suc
ceed. "Our country is prosperous, secure
and lmppy, and Its prosperity Is upon
a sound basis. Steps to protect our
commerce and Industry in any emer
gency after the European war ends
have "been taken. The anti dumping
clause of the so called war revenur
act provides the executive with ample
power io prevent the 'dumping of
European surplus manufactures upon
our markets,
"I am confident that the time has
passed in America when votes can be
bought, tho ballot box defiled by cor
rupt practices, or the judgments of the
American people determined or lnflu
onccd in any way by tho use of money,
It is, however, our duty to take every
precaution, lest conscienceless agent
of the sinister forces working In oppo
sition to progressive principles and
popular government resort in thei'
desperation to industrial coercion, or
to theiovll and insidious practices of a
decade and more ago,"

The coming of the party of Invaders
had been announced in messages sent
to Everett from Seattle headquarters.
A call to Industrial Workers of the
World members from all over th
state had been issued earlier in the
week and tho citizens of Everett plan,
ncd to meet tho Invaders and denr
them privilege of landing.
When the Verona reached the city
wharf, Sheriff MoRae, who was back
ed by a posse of deputy sheriffs an 4
citizens, stepped forward and inform,
ed tho men on tho boat that they
would not bo permitted to land. One.
ot the men, evidently spokesman tor
the party, began arguing with tha
sheriff and then made a speech.
Apparently as a signal, tho man,
dropped his hand and armed men on
the steamer opened fire on tho possa.
assembled on the wharf.
The first man to fall was Sheriff Me
Rae, seriously Injured. One man wa
killed instantly and in a moment th&
crowd on shore was panic-stricken.
Deputy sheriffs on tho wharf Quickly
rallied their forces, however, and re
turned the fire of the invaders on thv
Verona.
Men on the wharf and on the boat,
were seen to fall and the Verona Im
mediately backed out of tho dock and'
started back toward Seattle.
The trouble between the Industrial
Workers of the World and the author
ities at Everett has been on fox sev
eral months and was the outgrowth ot
a strike of shingle weavers here. After
several minor outbreaks of violence
during tho strike. Sheriff McRao or
ganized the citizens' committee and
expelled all members of tho Industrial
Workers from Everett.
On severnl occasions small partfea
of men havo attempted to enter Ev
erett, but have been turned back by
the sheriff. Last Monday forty-flv
members of the I. W. W. tame from
Seattle by steamer, but were met at
the wharf by the citizens' posso, load
ed Into automobiles and escorted io a.
point south of town, where they wer
liberated and ordered to leave.
