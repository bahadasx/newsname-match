LANAO, SUNK BY
U-BOAT, WAS U. S.
SHIP,SAYS SKIPPER
ONLY ONE AMERICAN
Vessel Was Flying U. S. Flag
When Held Up Off Portugal
and Scuttled.
STATE DEPARTMENT SILENT
LONDON, Nov. 7. There waa
onlv one American aboard the
steamer Lanao, sunk by a German
undersea boat October 28, it was
learned today.
Capt. Henry Mainland, reports
from Wales said, was the one Amer
ican aboard.
He said his ship was of Philip
pine registry and flew the Amer
ican ensign when she was held up
off the Portuguese coast, and scut
tled with a bomb after her crew
had been taken off.
Mainland left no doubt to the
nationality of his ship.
AWAITS FACTS.
The State Department today Is
waiting for further light on tho reg
istry of tho steamer Lanao. sunk by
a German submarine October 28, be
fore directing the embassy In Lon
don to mako Inquiry Into the circum
stances of the sinking.
The department was without word
corcerntng the sinking of the steamer
Lanao. it was agreed, however, the
case may prove to be similar to that
of Uie America! grain schooner William
P. Fryo early In the war. "If further
evidence like today's supports the origi
nal report that the vessel was of Ameri
can registry.
In her last noto on tho Fry, the Ger
man government said It had Instructed
naval commanders not to sink Ameri
can vessels unless carrying absolute
contraband. The Frye carried only
conditional contraband. Germany and
tha United States finally agreed to ar
bitrate the Interpretation of the Prussian-American
treaties of 1789 and 1828.
under -which Germany claimed the right
to alnk American vessels carrying con
traband. Without admitting the action would
prejudice hor case, Germany also agreed
to pay an indemnity for the destruction
of the Frye, the amount to toe deter
mined by a Joint commission. This
Government only accepted the German
proposal when Germany had agreed to
sink no more vessels carrying condi
tional contraband.

ION NIGHT
WILSON WILL GRANT
HALF-HOLIDAY PLEA,
REPORTS HERE SAY
Rumors Assert Clerks, Under
Proposed Order, Will Work
Other Days From 8:30 to 5.
CREATES STIU IN OFFICES
Department Officials Here,How
ever, Declare They' Know
Nothing of It.
Reports that the President had de
cided to tssuo an Executive order allow
ing Saturday half-holiday the year
round, and that clerks will bo required
to work from 8:30 to 5 on other days,
caused a stir about tho departments
today,
I 'os t master General Burleson said he
had not been consulted by tho President
about It, nor had ho had the oppor
tunity to confer with the President.
The Postmaster General Is not will
ing to say what recommendation he
will mako until he talks with tho Presi
dent. Tho Treasury Department denied
knowledge thot tho half-holiday was
to be granted. Chief Clerk Wllmcth
has not been so Informed.
Whllo It Is generally believed here
the half-holiday will be granted, those
who havo worked hardest for It said
today they wero not advised what
would Iks done.
P. O. May Retard Effort.
Tho Indications nro that tho Post-
ofilco Department may provo a stum
bling block to the half-holiday, at least,
In part. It Is, of courso, posslhlo that
It might bo applied to other departments
and not to the Postofllce Department.
while Mr. Durleson 1ms not announced
what nosltlon ho will take. It Is known
ho Is apprehensive that a Saturday half-
noiiuay win intorrcro wrtli thu man
servlco and does not believe tho coun
try would sanction any such Interfer
ence. This question of how to keep on han
dling tho malls and yet grant the Satur
day half-holiday Is one he Is under
stood to be wrestling with. This Is on
the theory that If a half-holiday Is
granted in Washington It will have to
bo applied to Federal employes outside
or wasnington.
No Word at State Department.
Chief Clerk Davis, of the State De
partment, said no Executlvo order on
the holiday had yot been received at
tha State Department. These Execu
tive orders arr sent in original form
to all Cabinet officers as soon as thoy
are signed by the President.
There was a persistent report In
Government circles today that tho
blanks for the Executive orders nro
row being printed at the Government
Printing Offlco and will be sent Im
mediately to Shadow Lawn for the
President's signature as soon as the
printing work Is completed.
Government Printing Office officials
refused to discuss the matter today.
Inasmuch ns all the Cabinet officers
except Postmaster General Durleson
havo made favorable recommendation
on tho half-holiday question, there
Is a general feeling In the depart
ments that tho President will sign
the Executive order immediately after
election, postponing action so that no
hint of political Influence will be at
tached to his action.
When Agitation Started.
This year, soon after the end of the
summer period In which the half-holiday
was allowed, tho agitation was be
gun for a continuance of the privil
ege during the entire year.
It was urged that Government
clerks, as a class, worked under
severe strain, that they had to be spe
cially competent for tasks of great
responsibility, and in conditions of
confinement where physical and nerv
ous strength was exhausted; the half
holiday would, therefore, serve to
rest and recuperate them and In the
end result In greater efficiency and
a saving to tho Government in the
cost of work performed.
uovornment clerks aro provided by
law with .thirty days' vacation every
year, and also are allowed thirty
days of sick leave without any with
holding of pav. The Saturday half
holiday Is purely an executive mat
ter. Congress not having recognized
It In appropriation bills.
It has been made possible to grant
the half-holiday by extending tho
hours of work dallv a half hour, so
that clerks work until half-past four
o'clock In the afternoon, whereas be
fore the half-holiday was granted
their day ended at 4.

Familiar with bruin's liking for ap

Carl D. Sheppard, his publicity agent,
nnd two detectives about 0:50.
The Governor walked tho three blocks
to tho voting booth, and return. Only a
few stragglers and a flock of newspaper
ment ana movie operators were on nanu
as ho went Into the dingy little Eighth
avenue building. .
It was so early that tho Governor was
on time to see tho green grocors and
fruit merchants placing tholr stock on
display In their outside show cases.
Just as ho reached tho street through
the ladles' entrance to the Astor, Clar

room, which was hidden behind garish
canvas signs that tell tho world In two
foot letters that "any gown can bo dry
cleaned for $1.00." tho price being printed
in flnrlnir crimson.
The Governor nodded to several police
men and attendants as ho entered and

Tho sun hadn't come .out strong as
Hughes stepped from tho booth, and
the room looked mighty dingy. It was
hardly big enoiiRh for a man to change
his mind In, but that dldn's stop a
dozen camorn and movlo men from Jam

The Governor saw ho was outnumber

About tho tlmo every one Insldo wus

heavier than ever before recorded

instances aggregating as much as
half the total registration.
Ideal weather in almost every
State aided in bringing out the
ballotcrs. In the "pivotal States"
of New York, Illinois, Indiana and

polls showed that the "silent

depends the election today, was
probably speaking very loudly.
