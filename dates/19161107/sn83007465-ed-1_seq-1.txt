/ Van Wyck, Nov. 6.?The fine'
weather continues and the farmers
/are making use of it in gathering
their crops and in sowing grain.
Some complain that the land is too
dry and hard to put grain in as it
should be, but there is an old saying
about "dusting wheat and smearing
in oats." If this is a true saying the
wheat crop will be put in right, as
there has been -dust for some time.

fine?a good stand but we have noticed
a good many Hessian Fly working
on it and if the dry, warm
weather continues much longer the
early oats will be set back by the fly!
saping it.
The Van Wyck community fair
was a great success and surpassed
the most sanguinary expectations of
its promoters. The officers of the
fair wish to express their thanks to
all who aided with exhibits, and in
Nother ways, to make it so successful.
Without the co-operation of the
community we could not have had aj
fair worthy of our enterprising com
munity. Now, as we have been successful
with our community fair,]
lets all join in and help to make our|
county fair a success. We have the
exhibits and we should have Van)
Wyck community well represented
at our third annual fair for Lancas
ter county. The other community
fairs of the county are arranging to
f have their exhibits there, and Van)
j Wyck must not be behind in this
movement. Why not Join in, in a
real co-operative spirit, and let Van
Wyck lead?
Some of our Van Wyck people a*-,

departments had tine exhibits and
show that this community has some
experts in these important lines.
On last Sunday morning there was
a little commotion among Van
Wyck people when it was reported j
that a horse had been stolen from th- j
stables of Mr. J. H. Crenshaw. The!
horse and the bridle was gone and|
the lot gate standing open. Parties,
followed the track of the horse to a,
point near Osceola, where they weroj
informed by a colored man that he!
found the horse wandering about and
put it in one of his stables. The con-j
elusion was that some one rode th*
horse to Osceola and there abandon- j
ed the hourse perhaps boarding aj
passing train. The horse was.recov-|
ered and seemed none the worse for
his night's outing.
Mr. Jim Oraham is shipping some
very fine aweetgum logs from Van
Wyck. These logs are being cut ana
hauled out of the Twelve Mile Creek
bottoms. The dry weather makes the
hauling of these logs comparatively
an easy job. as the land is like ai
paved road. There is some fine tim-i

In A Voluminous ai
Chief Executi
To The Lancaster NeuA: a
In your issue of October 25th, i
1916, taxpayer R. E. Wylie has a f
communication in which he contends c
that in view of the pending cons id- t
eration of the matter of supplying the a
Lancaster Cotton Mills with one mil- a
lion gallons of water per month the
city council should be sure of two ^
things, First: Whether such a con- t
tract would give the city a reason- i
able profit and second, whether the t
present source of water supply, con- t
sidering the future growth of the t
city, is not thereby endangered, and t
calls upon the city council to give t
the public the benefit of such facts, f
figures and estimates as they may f
have upon the subject. i
The Lancaster News in its issue or '
October 31st followed up this sub- '
ject with an editorial and expressed *
its understanding to he that tjie cost (
of supplying the water to the cot- '
ton mills would be $100 per month *
for every million gallons, aid that '
the city council would be generously ,
giving the cotton mills $30 per !
month, and advised caution unon the
city council. In this editorial stress '
was also laid upon the hazard of
undertaking to supply the water to 1
the cotton mill in view of the water <
supply upon which t.h'e present and 1
future needs of Lancaster citizens i
depend, and increasing the fire i
risks and cost of insurance protec- <
tion, and suggests that the taxpayors 1
do a little investigation on their own i
account, and urges the limelight of >
publicity to be thrown upon the I
matter.
Then again in the Issue of Novem 1
ber 3rd the editor of The News 4u t
grfrat nolmnlty in view of the? mag- 1
nitude of his fear that the city council
was about to do something ruin j
ous to the interests of the citizens,
addresses himself to the "Gentlemen ,
of the City Council" and calls at- (
tention to a rumor that the city j
council have decided or are about to?i.
decide to furnish water to the Lancaster
Cotton Mills and again wants
to know whether the city wouid g?n
a reasonable profit and whether the
source of water supply would not be
jeopardized.
While somewhat veiled in expression,
the purpose of the communication
of Mr. Wylie and the editorials,
all eminating from the same source,
and combination in hostility to certain
members of the city council and
to Col. Leroy Springs, as president of
the Lancaster Cotton Mills, is manifest;
and the design is not to honestly
serve the public, but to insinuate
that there is something rotten
in the scheme engineered to give the
interests of Col. Springs some advantage
at the expense of the public,
which calls for exposure, and to suggest
to the public that there is no
one in Lancaster more qualified to
protect the public interests tha\
those paragons of virtue, private and
civic, represented in the persons of
R. B. Wylie, Luther Kllison, and
their associates who egg them on to
hurtful insinuations against public
officials.
nut. in tntn communication. I will t
assume that the inquiries are honest I
and Intended to serve the public ann $
make answer in like purpose, espe- i
cially since some friends, whom 3 |
trust, deem it wise and proper to air
this business proposition In the public
prints, although any taxpayer or ,
citizen can get all the information he <
needs by proper Inquiry at the office {
of the city council. It would seem
that the fact that the city council is (
composed of men of good business!,
capacity and experience and thor-j]
ought? 'devoted to the .Interests of
the- city.iwould warrant a presumption
at least that they would not
jeopardise the Interests jof the citizens
who honored them,, aiid trusted (
them. . * (
First. Ad to the Status ?( the Matter. |
No contract'has been made to supply i
Lancaster Cotton Mills- with water ]
and Col. Leroy Springs, president,
has not sought to securef water of the
city council. As a matter of fact our
information is that the cotton mill
has an ample water supply obtained
from deep wells and the overflow of |
the city water darj. and is installintd

egard to obtaining water supply lil
rom the city. Our fear is that the til
ity may lose the benefit of a valua- w,
>le contract because of t*he captious
ind foolish hostility belne fomente<I
ind exhibited about the matter.
It may be that such a contract
vould avoid litigation In case the a
:lty should in the future attempt to d,
ncrease the height of its dam and
hereby destroy or materially reduce p<
he overflow of the stream's water to
o the mill's reservoirs. It may be't^
he city may want to raise the height jtn
)f its dam as a precaution against I f\i
tny possibility ofa diminution of the 1 di
itream of water, but in doing so it! w
night have to consider the possihll-1 w
ty of an injunction, or damage suit p<
n case a reasonable use of the if)
itream water was thereby denied th' ; pi
otton mill. Wouldn't it be.rather|ai
jenerous in the mill authorities m
ihould they be willing to pay the city
or water supply rather than litigate
vith it for depriving them of the ren- cl
lonable use of the stream water?
'Fools rush in where angels fear to lt,
read." L,
I have said tnat the proposition foi
he purchase of city water does not w
ome from the Lancaster Cotton el
Villi, but as a matter of fact it origin- t,
ited with the city council which, /t u
nay be, has a longer head than sonm |

n and in gross ignorance hinder th? ()]
accomplishment of a contract most J)(

future water supply. t)

"The mayor called the nttenTion of r*

Plenty of water and needed the,01

with Luther Ellison in the "

The sale of our surplus water t(
manufacturing plants, business con
cerns for automatic sprinklers, am
.0 out-of-town users is what kept thi
plant from operating at a loss before
the sewerage system was installed
The foregoing shows that there Is ;
"reasonable profit" to the city
ihoulri it be fortunate enough to el
actuate this contract.
As lo Sufficiency of Water Supply.
There is, in my opinion, absolute
ly no doubt of the sufficiency of tli
water supply now available to tak
"are of the growth of the city fo
many years to come, and stil! hav
many million gallons to spare.
Hefore the proposition was mad
to the mill. 1 personally asked Mi
II. S. Jaudon, the engineer who in
stalled the plant, whether or not h
would advise such a contract and h
unhesitatingly recommended it, stai
Ing that the city would have a ha nr.
some profit in it at seven cents pe
thousand gallons and that we ha
plenty of water to supply the need
of the city and take care of such
contract.
Should the flow of the stream ii
very dry seasons materially diminisl
the amount of water ordinarily hob
by the dam, ample reserve for all tli
needs of the city and the mill couh
easily be provided for by additiona
reservoirs which may he made a
comparatively small cost. The las
constructed reservoir, of nhmii ti~
tk.mos the capacity' of the origins
one. cost approximately $700.
The foregoing shows that our \va
ter supply is more than adequate fo
the present and for possible neett
of the future.
Incidental Benefits from Proposed
Contract.
As to fire protection, the interlock
ing of the city system with the mil
system w.ould greatly enhance th
power to control a eonflagratio
within our limits, for the reason tha
the mill system has two pumps wit
capacity of 1000 gallons, each, pe
minute, twice the capacity of the cit
pumping plant; the mill further ha\
ing reservoirs and tanks, complete
and contemplated, with greater ct:
pacity than the existing reservoii
of the city, all of which combine
power of reserved water would be a
command to fight a city conflagra
tion. Such a system would doubtles
tend to further lower insuranc
rates.
Furthermore, the mill village wit
a population over three thousand i
right at our door, and we are an
should be vitally interested in thei
health and welfare. We have abac
lutely pure and palatable water i
large quantity and if it be possibl
to put such water in the homes o
these worthy workers whose labor
are contributing so much to the up
budding of Lancaster no good cltl
zen should object.
