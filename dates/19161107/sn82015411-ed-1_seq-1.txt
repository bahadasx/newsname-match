OF CIRCUIT TERM
FILIPINOS BEAT
UP ft IKE
Last Wednesday morning at about
8 o'clock in a field back of the Kea
lia mill Louis Commit, section ltina
of the Makee Sugar Company, was
unexpectedly set upon by three
Filipinos and badly beaten up. The
names of the three men are Jose,.
Felipe and Suarez. It is alleged
that they clubbed the luna over the
head until he was almost helpless,
then tied him up and beat him. A
Chinaman came to the rescue and
he also was beaten and forced to re
treat receiving ugly bruises over
the back.
The Filipinos were arrested and
the following day, in Lihue, the
grand jury returned an indictment
against them of assault with weap
ons obviously and imminently dan
gerous to life. They will be tried
before a jury tomorrow or as soon
thereafter as practicable.
The impression has been advanc
ed by persons close to the facts that
the assault was probably not initiat
by the Filipinos themselves, hut that
they were put up to it by another
luna this other luna being close to
the scene ef the trouble at the
time.
TRYING TO Si
BEG COFFEE CROP
The following rather remarkable
story is from the Ililo Tribune:
So great is the Kona coffee crop
this year that there is a danger that
much of it may bo lost, and over in
Kona it is suggested that the mem
bers of the National Guard of Ha
waii in this county be called out to
help save this valuable crop.
"I don't see how we will be able
to save our colfeo crop this year un
less we call out tho militia," re
marked Lieut. Julian Yates, of
Company II, N. G. II., yesterday,
speaking ef tho labor famine in
Kona.
As it is, it is probable that the
schools of that district will all be
closed for a time and the children,
or at least those large enough tei
weirk, will be set. to picking the cof
fee berries. Recorel prices are now
being paid for this work in Kona
this year and as high as eighty-five
cents a bag is paid the pickers.
Quite a number of the coffee
planters have automeibiles scouring
the district for pickers, bringing
them from their homes as far away
as ten miles to pick and taking them
Inane at night. Goexl pickers are
getting SI. 50 a day, which is over
100 per cent more than in formei
years.
The drill grounds used by the
National Guard can no longer be
used for drills, as they aro now util
ized for drying the pulp coffee ber
ries, at both Napoopoo and Keala
kekua The Captain Cook Coffee Company
lias turned most ef its mill men in
to the fields and has supplied their
places in the mill with men who are
not such good pickers. Everything
possible is being done to save the
crop, which is large, of fine grade,
but which ripenenl suddenly,
t

SELF WITH POIS

by Grove Farm and living al Hale-
haka, Lihue, took bichloriile of
