REPORT COLORADO FOR WILSON
Candidates Neck and Neck In Kansas
GREAT WHISTLE
WILL ANNOUNCE
WHO'S ELECTED
The Times is going to report the election re
turns tonight to every person inside the city limits,
at least to every person who is not deaf.
This will be done by means of the immense
whistle on the T. li. & P. Co.'s power house, which
formerly was used for blowing fire alarms.
Just tho minute it is definitely known that
either Wilson or Hughes is to be the next president
the deep bass rumble, which easily carries as far as
South Tacoma and Fern Hill, will be heard in one
long prolonged blast which will mean, "Attention."
This will be followed by a second or two of si
lence and then, if Wilson is the lucky candidate, by
two short blasts fairly close together. The two blasts
will be repeated at intervals several times to insure
everybody's getting the signal correctly.
For Benefit of Shut-Ins
If Hughes is the winner, the long "attention"
will be followed by four short blasts instead of two,
and the four will be repeated until it is certain every
body has understood.
In view of the fact that the governorship may not
be definitely decided tonight, due to the slower count,
the whistle will be used only to indicate which can
didate is LEADING. As in the case of the presiden
tial race, the "attention" blast will be blown as soon
as satisfactory return come in. Then, if Lister is
leading, there will follow a long blast and a short
blast, to be repeated several tinies. "If Mcßride is
ahead the fact will be denoted by three long blasts
repeated several times.
The whistle arrangement was made by The
Times so that invalids and all the other shut-ins
might not be deprived of the satisfaction of knowing
the big news just as soon as anybody else.
Louis Bean, manager for the T. R. & P. Co.,
quickly consented to co-operate in the plan when it
was suggested to him.
Bulletins and Extras Also
But while the shut-ins are listening for the big
announcer, thousands of other Tacomans will be re
ceiving the election bulletins direct from The Times
screen at Ninth st. and Pacific ay.
The lantern will begin telling its -story just as
soon as it is dark. The bulletins will be furnished
by The Times' United Press leased wire, the fastest
in the world.
A $200 electrically driven Columbia talking
machine from Eilers will furnish inspiring music
betwixt and between.
For those who want the earliest news, The
Times' Pink edition this afternoon will be in great
demand. It will contain the news of the count in the
Aft-antic coast states, and will be followed at inter
vals by extra editions bringing the information up
to date.

BETTING ODDS FLOP
TO FAVOR WILSON
(I nil. .I IV«-»aj 1.rn.r.l Wire.)
NEW YORK, Nov. 7.—Tho
flood of ballots which will sweep
either Wilson or Hughes into the
preßidenry March 4 began rising
early today.
While publicly sponsors for the
republican and democratic organ
izations declare entire confidence
in the vote, privately they are
very much at sea.
In no previous fleet ion has
there been such complete
lack of indication of which
way the straws blow. The
"silent vote" has been more
silent than ever liefore.
Since the campaign opened
Aug. 10, there have been half a
dozen different "*'trends" to pub
lic sentiment, overlapping at
times. Today both sides were
claiming the benefit of such a
current.
The most unusual eleventh
hour development in connection
with the election was ln the bet
ting. Wall street prides itself on
having always picked a winner.
Up until midnight the odds
have favored Hughes. But today
they opened with less advantage
to the republican nominee—al-
most at even money.

although it was only 9 o'clock
when the president reached the
polls, he was the 50th voter. Tho
booth was in a fire engine house.
The president's arrival was
quickly learned by residents here
and a big crowd of people gather
ed about the voting place to cheer
the executive. He was given an
ovation by Princeton students in
passing through the streets of
the city.
President Wilson received the
ballot from R. H. Rose, a repub

7:03 this morning in the Vic

The governor walked the three

With a bright sun melting tho

In case there is a last-minute
rush, any person inside the polling
