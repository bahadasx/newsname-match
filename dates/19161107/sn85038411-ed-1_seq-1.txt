1 Early Vote Unusually Large
j All of the New England States In
their early reports of the voting dwelt
jon the heavy early balloting. Provi
; dence, R. 1., reported throughout the
State it was the heaviest ever known,
i New York State and other Middle
i Atlantic States all reported an un
usually large vote and similar reports
! came from the West and South, in
! dicating keen and even eager interest
i everywhere.
President Wilson motored from
Shadow Lawn to Princeton in the
early morning and voted ballot No.
30 shortly after 9 o'clock. He will re
ceive the returns at Shadow Lawn.
Itotli Sides Gratified
Charles E. Hughes in New York
voted ballot No. 13 a few minutes
after 7 o'clock :".:s morning at a
voting place near his hotel where he
will receive the returns to-night. The
fair weather and heavy early voting
was apparently pleasing news to those
in charge at both Republican and
Democratic national neadciuarters
here as both sides expressed gratitica
tion at the course or events.
Chairman William 11. Wiilcox. of
th Republican committee, was early at
his desk receiving telegraphic reports.
Chairman Vance 0. McCormick of the
Democratic Committee, was in Jlar
risburg. Pa., to vote but was expected
to return to his desk here later in the
day.
Expect I.ate Kctnrns
Political observers are in doubt as
to just when the election results will
become known. They incline to the
opinion that it will be later than in
recent years because ot the complex
situation resulting from the number
of women who will vote and other
causes.
VOTING STRAIGHT
Indianapolis, Nov. 7. Early re
ports from all parts of the State indi
cated that a heavy vote will be polled
to-day. The rapidity of the balloting

cations of "scratching."

| MAMMOTH CONDUIT SPANS HERR STREET SUBWAY i
K : ? '
Placing a twelve-ton concrete co nduit in position across the Herr street
suhway, with but twenty minutes delay to passenger service was a feat
performed by the Pennsylvania Railroad Sunday.
The conduit, which is reinforced with steel and includes terra colta
tubing, is 60 feet in length. It is three l'eet high and three feet wide. It
required four weeks to mold the conduit and put it in condition to
handle. On Sunday a large steam derrick lifted the big slab in position.
Only one train was delayed, as it was necessary to run the derrick on the
passenger track. The ab< ve j)ictur e shows tlie process of lifting the con

British Have Lost Cruisers
and Battleships of 501,790
Tons Since Start of War
Berlin, Nov. 7.—By Wireless. —The
sinking of a British small cruiser, off
the Irish coast by a German submarine,
has increased the total British losses
in battleships and cruisers to 501,790
tons, says an Overseas News Agency
announcemnt to-day. Tills does not
include auxiliary cruisers, submarines,
torpedo boats or guard ships lost.
"According to the known strength of
the British navy at the beginning of the
war, it has lost U per ceni. of Its battle
ships; 30 per cent of its armored
cruisers and 14 per cent of its protected
cruisers. Thirty nine ships of a total
of 443.500 tons haw been destroyed
by German naval forces."
The extent of the British losses are
notable in view of the fact that af-the
beginning of the war the French navy's
tonnage was 437.000 and the Italian
navy's 335,000. "Moreover, the British
navy has lost 50 torpedo boats of 71,500
tons and 76 submarines. The figures
given taken into consideration only
those losses regarding which no doubt
exists." x

"Bobbie" Ulsh Was Big
Feature of Millersburg Rally
Millersburg, Pa., Nov. 7. Millers
burg. Republicans held a jollillcation
last night, bringing the campaign to
a close with a rally that crowded the
Lyric theuter to the doors, with "00
people trying to get in who could not.
and which lasted until 11 o'clock. It
was the largest and most enthusiastic
rally in the political history of the
town.
Harry M. Fairchiids, one of the best
known Republicans in Dauphin coun
ty and a general favorite here, was
the presiding officer and the Millers
burg band played. Addresses were
made by Charles E. Pass, Philip S.
Moyer, formerly a resident of this
place: Ira E. Ulsh, and David J.
Pechtold, candidates for the Legisla
ture: Senator E. E. Heidleman and
Congressman Aaron S. Kreider.
The meeting was full of ginger from
the very start and scarcely a person
left during the three and one-half
hours which the speakers occupied
with a discussion of the campaign. Mr.
Ulsh is n well-known resident of this
town and when he was called upon
to speak he received an ovation that
spoke well for his vote in Millersburg
to-day. In the audience were many
some ehihlrwn, among them
Mrs. Ulsh with little "Robbie" Ulsh,
the four-year-old son of the candidate.
As Mr. Ulsh stepped forward on the
platform "Bobbie" spoke right out in
the meeting. "Why. there's Dad," he
cried to his mother and then "Hello,
Dad." The big audience cheered for
"Bobbie" and the irrepressible insisted
upon climbing up on the stage, where
he sat on Senator Beidleman's knee
and waved a flag for the remainder of
the evening.
After the meeting Mr. and Mrs.
Fairchild entertained Senator Beidle
man. Congressman Kreider and the
others of the campaign party at lunch
at their home.
Lanao Was Sunk by
German Submarine While
Flying American Flag
Cardiff, Nov. 7. The steamship
Lanao. which was sunk by a subma
rine on October 28, was under Philip
pine registry and was flying the Am
erican Hag when destroyed according
to statements made here on Monday
night by Captain Henry Mainland, the
only American on board.
Captain Mainland, the other officers
and the crew of the Lanao, were land
ed here by the Norwegian steamer
Tromp.
Captain Mainland says the I-anao
was carrying a cargo of rice from
Saigon to Havre. The submarine stop
ped the ship in the afternoon, firing
across her bow. After the engines
were reversed two more shots were
fired, the captain says, but none took
effect. The ship's papers were sent to
the submarine which was two miles
away. The German commander,
speaking good English, said that-be
cause the Lanao was carrying contra
band he was compelled to sink her.
The Germans removed some food
stuffs from the steamer and treated
the crew courteously, transferring
them to the Tromp half an hour after
their boat was destroyed.

Stocks Soar as Market
Looks For Hughes Victory
United States Steel, with other
leaders dependent on tariff con
ditions, rose to unparalleled prices
in the stock market yesterday, the
sensational advance reflecting Wall
Street's confidence in a Hughes vic
tory at the polls to-day. Steel
common mounted to 123 V 4, exactly
a point above its previous maxi
mum. Utah Copper and Central
1 .leather rivaled Steel in ascending
to new records, Utah gaining 2%
at 114 1,4 and Leather 5 points at
10314.
Gains in other diversified groups
ranged from 1 and 4 points, the
greater part of which was main
tained. Altogether it was one of
the best days Wall Street has ex
perienced in weeks, the market's
remarkable strength and breadth
being attributed to confidence in a
Republican sweep and the return
of the country to Republican prin
ciples.

MING HE GASPS
HOW SWEETHEART
SET HIM AFIRE
On Death Hod Henry Robinsoif
Whispers Story to County
Detective
HOLD INQUEST THURSDAY
"Tools" Gates May Have to
Answer to Charge of
Murdering Lover
Fighting for breath with lungs and
throat blistered by the (lames he had
inhaled, Henry Robinson, on his
death lied at the Harrislnirg Hospital,
gasped his story to County Detective
James T. Walters. If at the coroner's
inquest Thursday evening Maine Gates
is held accountable for Robinson's
death, then the dying man's statement
will likely be used against her to sup
port the State's charge of murder.
Detective Walters obtained Robin
son's statement shortly after he had
been brought in from a South Harris
burg house where he had been so se
verely burned that the hospital au
thorities didn't expect him to live. He
had mentioned Maine, or "Toots,"
Gates, a one-time sweetheart, in ids
ravings and the county officer thought
it wisest to get a statement.
Robinson gasped his story in a
voice so low that the detective had to
bend far oxer the cot: again and again
the pron* f iught for breu 4 " to
complete a sentence.
" started to leave—when—Mame
—called me back," panted t lie man on
the cot; "she said—she said—she was
a-goin'—to—kill me—if 1 went. I—l
—said 'Go 'way woman' " —Robinson
paused to gasp painfully and the
breath wheezed noisily in his throat.
"I said 'I want to go home.' Then she
-—she —set me—on lire. She—throwed
coal oil on me—and then—she struck
—a match and lit some paper—and—
throw —that—on me. And then she—
screamed—'Oh, lioudy'—that's the
name she called—'lioudy. I—l—didn't
mean to set you—on fire" —
"Yes, sir 1 think think l'm
a-goin'—to die!"
Robinson fought desperately again
for his breath and then wearily closed
: his eyes. And some time Saturday
morning a nurse gently drew a sheet
over the quiet face. f
