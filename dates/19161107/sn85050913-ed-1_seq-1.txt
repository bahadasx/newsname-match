Allied Force—Take
Offensive.
Bucharest, Nov. 7.—Roumanian
armies have advanced' along their
whole line on the Dufrrudja front,
the war office announced this after
noon.
Rome, Nov. 7.— An Austrian sub
marine attacked an Italian troop
transport and was sunk in an engage
ment with a torpedo boat which was
escorting the transport. The torpedo
boat was badly damaged and sunk
later. The crew of both vessels were
mostly rescued by the transport.
London, Nov. 7.—After a week or
"more of doubt concerning operations
in the Dobrudja region of Rumania,
where the Teutonic allies had' been
marching almost unimpeded north
ward from, the Black sea to the Dan
ube, comes the report that the Ru
manians have taken the offensive,
probably aided by Russians and com
pelled the enemy to retreat at sev
eral points.
•A
On the Transylvania front, how
ever, the Rumanians in the Jiul val
ley, who for some time had 'been
holding the upper hand over the
Austro-Germans, forcing them to
give ground, have now been stopped,
the Teutons having brought up rein
forcements. In the Predeal pass re
gion, after heavy fighting, the Ru
manians also have met with a re
verse, being compelled to retreat af
ter long and stubborn battles.
All along the battle line in France
between the Somme and Ancre riv
ers the Germans are tenaciously dis
puting attempts by the British and
French to gain further ground. Ber
lin says that in Sunday's fighting ov
era front of twelve miles the French
and British suffered heavy casual
ties and won nothing except a local
gain in the St. Pierre-Vaast wood.
London admits that the British were
compelled to give back to the Ger
mans ground the British had prev
iously won at the Butte de Warlen
court.
Bombardments and small infantry
attacks continue to feature the fight
ing in the Macedonia theater.

Buenos Aires, Oct. 25.—Letter to
the Freeman-tribune from Charles
vUift*. Stewart, United Press Correspond
cnt: A proposition is before the Ar
'J jgentine congress to change the Buen-
Vos Aires form of government. Hith
**$,*jerto the city has had a commission
^government like Washington. The
^.v.^ jpeople are tired, however, of having
—A
jthelr affairs regulated for them by
outsiders. They point out that this
management has resulted in piling
up one of~ the largest municipal
debts, considering the community's
siae, in the world. It is also remark
ed that the attempt to economize by
^the unauthorized withholding of
ipercentages of the city employes
wages, is resulting in & tiresome ser-

ies of strikes by the scavengers,
grave diggers and other classes of
city workers.
The situation is also more irritat
ing from a numerical standpoint
than the one in Washington, where
a national population of about 100,
000,000 dictates arbitrarily to a
city of about 350,,000, while in Ar
gentine, a total population of ap
proximately 7,000,000 makes local
regulations for a capital with a pop
ulation exceeding 1,500',000.
The new plan, if adopted, will
abolish the existing commission in
favor of a municipal council, to be
elected by the citizens. A unique
feature of the proposal is that it con
fers the municipal franchise upon
foreigners more than 18 years old
who have lived in Buenos Aires more
than two years if they are married
to Argentine women, are parents of
Argentine children or pay taxes to
a specified amount. The plan even
makes them eligible to councilor
ships above the age of 26. Further
more, following the example of the
national election law, the idea is to
make the exercise of the franchise
obligatory. There is considerable
criticism of this clause, disregard of
the national compulsory voting law,
which provides a penalty of tem pes
os or a term of imprisonment upon
eligibles who neglect to cast their
ballots, having proved so general
that the jails would not have held
the offenders if they had been prose
cuted.
A FLORAL WREATH
NEARLY KILLS FLYER
?'t
San Diego, Cal., Nov. 7.—Avia
tor Oliver Meyerhotffer had a narrow
escape yesterday when, from a
h^tgtlt'- of 1,000' feet, he attempted
to"6j4p a floral wreath near the cas
l^l^containlng the body of Joe Boc
qu#)f an aviator who was killed here
Saturday.
Meyerhoffer hovered over the fun
eral procession that was escorting
Bocquel's remains to the Santa Fe
station for shipment to San Francis
co. As the casket was being taken
from the hearse, Meyerhoffer drop
ped his wreath. A gust of wind
brought it up against the motor of
his hydor-aeroplane, short-circuiting
it, and killing the .engine. Only by
skillful volplaning was Meyerhoffer
enabled to effect a landing on the
bay.

HUKERS STRIKE
Chicago, Nov. 7.—Between three
and four hundred cigar makers of
Chicago went on strike yesterday
for higher wages, despite the fact
that a new scale, calling for ad
vances from $1 to $6 a thousand for
cigars, according to grade, is now
before the international union for
ratification by referendum vote, the
result ^of which is to be announced
Nov. 13.
Cigar manufacturers affected by
yesterday's walkout said they were
perplexed as to the reasons for the
present walkout, but. confessed that
the remainder of the city's 3,000
workers would strike before the end
of the week.

Washington, D. C., Nov. 7.—Mem
bers of civilian rifle clubs, by win

Match evehts, shot under govern
ment auspices at Jacksonville, Fla.,
October 23-25, justified their entry
Into these competitions which here
tofore have been largely restricted
to rifle and pistol shots from mili
tary establishments.
Although entirely new to the Na
tional Match game, a Missouri civil
Ian, W'. H. Spencer of the Mound
City, St. Louis, Rifle and Revolver
club, today holds the title of Nation
al Rifle Champion, having bested 933
other experts from the Marine Corps
and National Guard, in firing the
National Individual Match, October
23. G. E. Cook of Washington, D.
C., another civilian, met and van
quished more than 500 pistol experts
in the National Pistol Match, with
the remarkable score of 399 points
out of a possible 420. In addition to
these honors, to the civilians fell the
prized "Soldier of Marathon" Trophy,
one of the prizes In the National
Team Match. This was won by the
California Civilian Rifle Team, which
in a field of 53 teams finished in
ninth place. To the regular estab
lishment, represented by the Marlni
Corps, went the first place in the Na
tional Team Match and the first
place in the United Service Match.
The National Matches were the
climax of a long series of shooting
events—the annual competitions
staged ty the National Rifle Associa
tion and the Southern Rifle Associa
tion and victory in these contests
is regarded among American rifle
men as the last word in deciding
championships.
Heretofore civilians have not been
officially recognized in these events.
This year, however, Congress auth
orized the participation of civilian
'clubs, of which there are now some
1600 organized under the National
Rifle Association.
From the very first, the civilian
riflemen won recognition on the
State Camp Range by going upon the
firing line, side by side with veteran
military shots, and by giving them a
hard tussle in most of the difficult
events with the military weapon—
the service rifle—and in many in
stances coming off victorious.

Albany, N. Y., Nov. 7.—Electors
of New York will decide today
whether the state shall issue $10,

used in enlarging and beautifying
state parks. The great objects, ac
cording to a booklet issued by the

WEAKNESS OF THE
NATIONAL LEAGUE
New York, Nov. 7.—The weakness
of the National League brand of
base ball as compared with the snap
py brand dished out by the American
League, pointed out by the United
Press in the last World Series, was
admitted today by Governor John K.
Tener, President of the National
League. It isn't Wilbert Robinson
who is so much to blame for the loss
of^ the World Series, according to
Gov. Tener, but is due to the fact
that the players who made up the
National League club were wholly
unable to do the things which might
have won ball games. It would have
been useless, Tener contends, for
Robinson to follow tactics other than
the ones he did follow. The fielding,
Governor Tener agrees, was some
thing awful and the Brooklyn club
never has a chance against such a
grand organization as the Red Sox.
Tener, however, is extremely opti
mistic and he believes that before
the time comes for another world
series his league will be strengthen
ed to such an extent that it will give
its rival opposition of the sternest
sort. Work is now being done, he
declares, which will give the Nation
al League undoubted strength. The
National League proxy agreed that
there were several clubs in the Na
tional League at the close of the last
playing season which would have
given the world series fans a better
formance of the civilians at Jackson
ville.
By winning two of the three gov
ernment events, it is believed that
the civilians have amply proven that
the decision of Congress to throw
open the National Matches to them,
was a wise provision.
