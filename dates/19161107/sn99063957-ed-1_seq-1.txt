"If Hughes makes the same showing
he has so far as the count progresses,

Ohio Is Conceded
To Wilson by Large
Plurity Over Hughes
Columbus. Ohio, Nov. 7. Ohio has
given President Wilson a substantial
majority on the basis of returns re
ceived up to 10:30 p. m.
State Chairman Finley at that hour
reiterated his claim that Wilson's final
majority would be 100,000 or bettor
and detailed returns from !25 precincts
in 30 counties appeared to bear out his
claim of a safe margin for the presi
dent in the Buckeye state.
These precincts, which included one
third of the total precincts in Hamil
ton county, and less than one-tenth of
the total in Cuvahoga county, gave
Wilson 4o,48; Hughes 40,320.
This was an average of slightly bet
than ten votes to the precinct in favpr
of Wilson. This ratio, if carried
throughout the state, would give Wil
son approximately 00,000 majority. The
Hamilton county vote, however, is held
to justify Finley 's prediction thnt
Wilson 's lead will be above this figure.
Ohio I Conceded.
New York, Nov. 7. Republican na
tional headquarters at 11:.'0 tonight
took Ohio off their "uncertai" list
and conceded that it has gone to
Wilson.
HUGHESjSEEMS
TO HAVE LEAD
FOR PRESIDENT
New York Papers Say That
Republican Is Elected
President
OVER RIVAL CLAIMS
Many States In Various Var
ious Sections of Union
Close and Doubtful
By Perry Arnold,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
New York, Nov. 8. At 2:30 a. m.
the presidential election was more in
doubt than at midnight, with Wilson
showing surprising strength in Kansas,
Wisconsin and Minnesota.
The republican national committee
still claimed the election of Hughes by
at least 300 electoral votes. The New
York newspapers, which earlier in the
night had announced the election ' of
Hughes, however, were tempering their
headlines; The Worfl whanged ''Hughes
victory" to read ."Hughes leads" and
others took similar precautions.
Massachusetts, which had beon prac
tically conceded to Hughes earlier in
the night, was now declared to bo. in
doubt.
At 2:30 Bobert Woolley, democratic
director of publicity, declared:
"Early republican claims of victory
are vanishing into thin air. The elec
tion of Wilson becomes more certain
every hour."
Republican Chairman .Willcox snid he
had no reason to revise his claims for
Hughes.
All leaders were eagerly watching
the returns from the far wost and mid
dle west, where the result was still in
doubt. The democrats conceded Illi
nois to Hughes and practically admit
ted they had no hope of winning in
Indiana. Ohio was classified by the
democrats as positively certain for
Wilson, but the republicans still
claimed it, basing their hopes on the
rural vote.
Wilson Leads In Minnesota.
' St. Paul, Minn., Nov". 8. Wilson car
ried Minnesota, according to early in
dications from 142. of the 3,008 pre
cincts. Those give Wilson 20,198 and
Hughes 17,7.10; Fred Wheaton, demo
cratic state chairman, said the icturns
from country districts could not over
throw tho big lead WilsoVi is piling up
in the Twin Cities. Republicans do not
concede the state.
Governor Burnquist, republican, is
easily leading for re-election, while
Dan Lawler, democrat, and Frank Kel
logg, republican, are running a neck
and neck race for the United States
senate.
Deadlock of Claims.
New York, Nov. 8. With one excep
tion, all the New York newspapers at
1:00 o'clock this morning declared Oov
erno Hughes elected president of tho
I'nited ritntes. The exception was the
Evening Post, which, in a midnight ex
tra, merely stated the election of
Hughes seems pronanie.
When the Morning World conceded
HugheB' election, tjut gave him only
20.1 electoral votes, with several states
still ia doubt, the Tribune gave the re
publican candidate 291 votes and the
Sun 310. The vote necessary to elect is
200. The Tribune gave Wilson 199 elec
toral votes anil tiie Sun 149.
Newspapers Bay Hughes.
New York, Nov'. 8. A deadlock of
claims from republicans and dem
ocrats; a strong trend by Hughes be
ing apparently cut down by a late
swing toward Wilson this was the
situation ia the 29th national election
at 1 o'clock this morning.
National Democratic Chairman Vance
MeCormick set "not less than 273"
electoral votes as his prediction of
the outcome.
National Republican Chairman Will
cox increased his earlier statement
claiming .100 for Hughes by four addi
tional votes.
In the first hour after midnight,
preliminary indications were that Cali
fornia, claimed by botn parties, would
go republican; Delaware, probably for
Wilson; Wisconsin probably for
Hughes.

J K cti Wih V ' A J
New York, Nov. 7. (9:30 p. m.) On the face of all
returns obtainable at this hour-returns general enough
almost to preclude the possibility .of dfny change in the result-Charles
Evans Hughes today was elected president
of the United States. ' ;
Republicans were claiming a landslide. Democratic
leaders refused to concede
basing their hope for a change in the figures on the fact
that at this hour the returns necessarily were incomplete.
Many of them admitted privately, however, however that
ihts was almost a forlorn hope.
Newspapers Say Hughes Elected.
New York, Nov. 7. At 8:45 tonight it seemed certain
that Charles Evan Hughes had been elected president of
the United States. At this hour it was apparent that
only a miraculous change in the returns could turn the
result to Wilson.
With New York certain for Hughes, Illinois conceded,
Indiana sweeping into the republican camp, only Ohio
remained among trie doubtful "pivotal states" to be
classified.
The democratic leaders were clinging to the hope that
the country vote in the middle western states yet might
turn the balance in their favor.
From Kansas, however, where the early returns
seemed to indicate a strong drift to Wilson, the later
figures added to the Hughes confidence.
At 9 o'clock Charles Evan Hughes said, through Chair
man Willcox:.
"The victory is greater than we had hoped for and
greater than we had reason to expect."
The returns from Michigan and Minnesota were very
slow. Colorado, California and the far west, were yet to
be heard from.
At this hour the New York World (democrat) con
ceded the election of Charles Evan Hughes, which was
also claimed by the New York Tribune and the New
York Herald (republican.)
National Chairman MeCormick at democratic head
quarters at 9:15 refused to concede the election of
Hughes.
"I am confident that complete returns will show the
re-election of President Wilson," he declared.
At the republican headquarters congratulations were
being exchanged all around.
The leaders gathered about Chairman Willcox whose
only remark for publication was:
"There will be no wathful waiting for the next four
years except among the democrats on the outside looking
in."
The New York Times (democrat) ata 9:50 p. m. said
that "indications point to a Hughes victory."
The Times conceded Ohio and Oregon to Hughes.
At 9 o'clock Chairman Willcox issued the following
statement:
"It appears that Hughes has been elected by a landslide
and that both houses of congress are solidly republican.
"The south is still solid but sorry."
the defeat of the president!
There are 531 votes in tho electoral
college- States conceded1 to the repub
licans by the democrats from the first
havo been Iowa, Maine, ' New Hamp
shire,, Pennsylvania,' Rhode Island and
Vermont a total of 70 electoral votea.
On the basis oi returns to 9:15 p. m.,
Hughes has apparently carried New
York, 45 votes; Indiana, 15 votes; llli-
states. This would give him 89 elcctor-
zu votes of
i ai votes.
The republicans assert that with Maar
sachusetts and Connecticut, Michigan,
Minuesota, Wisconsin and Kansas this)
brings his total to 104 electoral votes,
and his election was assured with a to
tal vote ranging from 275 to 300. These
estimates were all made without returns
from the far west, where the republi
cans were extremely confident.
At republicans hondquarters it was
pointed out that such a victory woubt
undoubtedly mean a republican major
ity in the senate and huuse.
Walsh 'a Palth In West
Chicago, Nov, 7. "1 eouefrtn noth
ing," said Senator Thorns J. Walsh,
campaign manager at western demo
cratic, headquarters upon hearing that
Hughes bad been conceded the election.'
"I have always based on claims of
western states," he said. "There ia v
fine chance that we carry Wisconsin,
Ohio and Indiuua. Practically no re
turns arc in from far western states."
Make No Statement
Asbury Park. N. J., Nov. 7. At &:5
o'clock tonight it was announmed at the
executive offices:
''We believe President Wilson hn
bee:i re-elected. There is nothing, to
date to alter this view. , Wo are not so
precipitate as our opponents in an
nouncing results."
Chicago Says It's Hughes.
Chicago, III., Nov. 7. The Chicago
Daily News, independent republisan at
8:20 tonight cluimed the election of
Hughes.
No Democratic Statement.
New York, Nov. 7. Shortly after 9
o'clock Democratic Chairman MeCor
mick sent word to the newspapermea
that there would be no further an
nouncements from him tonight unless
he was sure of the result.
Massachusetts For Hughes.
Boston, Mass. The Boston (Hoke
concedes Massachusetts to Hughes by
more than 10,000.
Ohio Blides to Wilson. ,
Columbus, Ohio, Nov. 7. Sixty four
precincts in seven Ohio counties give
Wilson 7,500; Hughes 4, 821. These
precincts showed Wilson leading by an.
average of 4fi to the precinct. Jf this
ratio is maintained, Wilson will carry
the state by closo to 125,000. Demo
cratic, state headquarters claimed that
the ''Wilson landslide in Ohio makes
the election of United' States Senator
Pomercne and Governor Cox a cer
tainty. One of tho surprises of the early re-
turns was the Pomerenc vote, running
in many districts well up with Wilson.
Michigan for Hughes.
Detroit, at 9:45, the democratic
state chairman, Stevenson, conceded
Michigan to Hughes "by a normal re-
