JUDGE WILDER
TALKS IN COURT
ON TEMPERANCE
presiding in Court He
Points Out to Human Dere
licts as Horrible Examples
Judge Frank Wilder, whose "desire to
set young men on the "straight road"
is daily demonstrated in the city
court, delivered a temperance lecture
to two clean-cut looking youths, thi3
morning,. Edward Cook, 28 years" of
age, of 51 Cedar street, and Charted
Toepfer, 22 years, of 687 Shelton street,
with fruitful effect
Both young men had been arrested
for drunkenness and admitted that
they had entered a saloon imlmedlately
on getting through work to have three
or four drinks. '
''Why must young men -of your age,
enter a liquor store, as soon 'as your
day's toil is finished " asked the judge.
"What good do you think liquor does?
Do you think you derive any benefit
from it? ,
"Turn- around and look at those hu
man derelicts in the pen. Look at
those mental and physical wrecks.
They started on their downward ca
reer, young in life, in just the same
fashion as you. If you persist in this
habit you'll end1 your days as these
men,: in the workhouse."
Apparently appreciating the edvice
of Judge Wilder, 'both youths, wtyo
had never been arrested before, paid
fines of J5 each and left the court
house. .

POLICE INQUIRE
INTO AUTHOR OF
STRANGE LETTER
Woman Protests Against
Letter With ! "White
Slave" Atmosphere
The police of this city are consider
ing taking steps to curb the inordinate
penchant of Patrick Murphy, who is
well known, to answer advertisements
placed in newspapers by young women
seeking employment, his activities of
late causing the authorities some con
cern. '
A letter has been1 received by Lieut.
E. O. Cronan, which was written by
Mrs. Minnie Gresta, of New York, as
a result of an answer Murphy is sup
posed to have sent from this city to
a young New York widow who was
seeking x general housework and a
home for her two-year-old child.
Murphy, who was. recently evicted
from a house in Fairfield avenue.
with a woman, is alleged to have made
an improper proposal to the young
widow, with the result that the local
authorities were communicated with,
by Mrs. Gresta, who suggested "a few
months in the 'cooler' would cool his
desire for feminine society."
The advertisement which Murphy,
whose present address is .unknown to
the police, answered, read as follows:
"Housework Young widow with 2
year baby wishes general .housework.
K. 579 World, Uptown."
The construction of his answer re
sulted in Mrs. Gresta sending the fol
lowing protest to the : Bridgeport au
thorities: y
"Chief of Police, Bridgeport, Ct.
"Dear Sir I placed the above
ad in Sunday's World for a young
respectable woman employed in
vthe house I reside in. You see
there is nothing suggestive in this
ad. The enclosed is an answer
she received from your city. New
York is plentifully supplied with
White Slaves and the New York
police have" their hands full deal
ing with them. It would suit this
old reprobate if he has any spare
time, to cultivate it, in educating
himself instead of thinking jabout
young or old women. Such 'as he
is neither good for God, country or
woman.
"I am writing this letter in case
you have any trouble with this
male creature in the future or I
complaints, you will know he de
serves all the punishment you can
give him. A few months in the
'cooler would coqI his desire for
feminine society.
"Yours very truly,
"MRS. MINNIE GRESTA."

BOY SCOUTS HAVE
COME TO SIGNIFY
MUCH TOjhE CITY
Recent Notable Public Cere
monies, Have Demonstrat
ed Their Usefulness.
No one who attended the reCentS?a-
geant in the Yale Bowl failed to notice
the hundreds of Boy Scouts in their
trim khaki uniforms who were every
where on service. If anyone need
ed any directions, there was a 'boy
scout at his elbT to give them if
a child lost its mother in the crowd a
scout gather it in arid stayed with it
until she was found. Lo?;t articles
were picked up by the scouts and if
the owners could not be found, they
were put in some place" of safety to
be called for later. A hundred and
one things' these . quick witted, well
trained vyoungsters found to do. And
this is always the case where the Boy
Scouts are on duty.
One of the fundamental , principles
underlying the Boy Scout movement.
and to which each scout must sub
scribe is1 the daily good turn. It is as
much part of his program to look foi
the opportunity ,to do a good turn
each day as it is any other of his
daily tasks. In England the Boy
Scout is permitted to tie a kerchiet
about his neck only vfter having done
his good Jurn. To se? in England 100
Boy Scouts with a kerchief properly
tier at any function means that each
and every, one of them have perform
ed some act of charity oiassistance
during the day. It may , have been
a courteous answer to some man who
asked the direction, it may have been
assistance offered to some woman. who
wished to cross the strc et, it may havi
been one of a hundred of other1; little
things which in the aggregate , count
for much. In this country the wear
ing of , the kerchief is not a part of
the. scout uniform, and therefore, the
daily insignia is missing. However, it
is a distinct part of every Boy Scout's
daily program.
In addition to these individual good
tudns each scout troops Is expected oc
casionally to participate in what is
Known In scout lore as a community
good' turn. This community good
turn may be at some time of emer
gency, for Instance, at the time of the
Salem fire, or upon some stated occa
sion such as in conjunction with large
parades or civic movements.
At the time of the Salem fire . the
Boy Scouts of Beverly,. Salem, Glou
cester .and Marblehead volunteered
their services caring for children, and
establishing and maintaining"" the dan
ger line in and about the burning dis
trict. At the time of the Dayton flood the
Boy Scouts of Dayton and vicinity
were among the first to volunteer their
assistance in rescuing property and
life. In hundred of other instances
which are less spectacular, but equally
as heroic these young chaps have
demonstrated their willingness and
ability to be of real service in time
of emergency.
A short time ago a Bridgeport man
was standing on the platform of the
New Haven road at the Mt. Vernon
station at a time when a passenger
was caught between a moving train
and the platform and his foot terribly
lacerated and ankle badly sprained.
Among the scores of spectators who
saw the accident there was only one
person who was equal to the ' emer
gency, and that was a Boy Scout, who
took absolute command of the situa
tion, and with the assistance of a lo
cal policeman moved bacit the crowd,
moved the injured person to a com
fortable position, removed the shoe
