Washington, Oregon, California
and West Virginia apparently hold
the balance of power in the Presi

doubtful. The House and Senate
are apparently Democratic.

SPLENDID MEETING

Look At Lincoln
MAGNIFICENT MAJORITY FOR
WILSON AND HELM
Republicans Are Snowed Under Here
By Splendid Majority of
336 Votes.
Wednesday, 1:30 a. m., Nov. 8.
Latest dispatches from Louisville
and Cincinnati to the I. J., indicate
that the race for the Presidency is
very close between Wilson and
Hushes with the odds decidedly in
favor of Hughes. The Republican
National Committee is claiming
Hughes' election with 320 electoral
votes. Vance McCormack, Demo
cratic National Chairman, however,
refuses to concede the election of
Hughes and claims that Wilson has
Avon.
Returns were very hard to obtain
from any of the doubtful states up
to an early hour. While it is ac
knowledged that Hughes has carried
New York, Indiana and Illinois are
claimed by both sides, but with the
chances favoring Hughes. The Dem
ocratic leaders say that Wilson has
shawn surprising strength in the
western states and that he will show
up with enough votes in them to
pull him through.
However, all indications point to
the election of Hughes as the next
president, though the complete vote
from the states which are missing
-may cause a change. Wilson showed
unexpected strength in such states
as Kansas and California and may
have a chance to carry both when
full returns are in.
S'
EARLY BULLETINS
Republicans claim Connecticut,
Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Maine,
Iassachusettes, Michigan, New Jer
sey, New Hampshire, New lork,
Oregon. Pennsylvania, nnoue i&iuuu,
So'th Dakota, 'Virginia, Washington,
Vt V'rginia, Wisconsin and Cali
fn ' -aking a total of 254 elec
toral votes. .
Nebraska and Kansas give Wilson
good margin in early returns.
New York's majority for Hughes
will be about 65,000.
About one-third of precincts in In
dianapolis give Hughes lead of 300
in city. . .
Indications point to Illinois being
in the Hughes column.
Republican national headquarters
claim Hughes elected and the next
House, republican.
Eoston gives small Democratic ma
Texas came in with usual 150,-
000 democratic majority.
If all the rest of the country had
acquitted itself as well as old Lin
coln, there would have been noth
ing to it but Wilson everywhere.
The largest democratic vote ever
polled in a presidential race and al
most a record breaker from a demo
cratic standpoint was polled Tues
day and Wilson carried the county
by 336 votes, a splendid majority.
When it is recalled that Wilson's
majority over the combined Taft and
Roosevelt vote in this county in 1912
was less than 50, it will easily be
seen what a splendid race the Pres
ident ran here. In every precinct
in the county the democratic vote
snowed a tremendous gain, except
at Highland, where the the republi
cans made their sole gain in the coun
ty. Few county races, where the
most excitement is usually found in
an election, ever caused as much in
terest as this presidential race.
Congressman Harvey Helm ran
right along with the president in the
county and if anything, perhaps will
exceed.his vote slightly when the of
ficial returns are in.
The largest vote for a Socialist
candidate ever polled in this coun
ty was cast for Benson, the Social
ist candidate for president at Row
land, where he got 29 votes.
The unofficial vote of all the pre
cincts in Lincoln county as phoned
in to the I. J. office after the polls
closed Tuesday afternoon, is as follows:

And there stood old Kentucky, re
turned to an old-time Democratic
majority, which the Courier-Journal
earlv Wednesday mornimr said
would be 24,000 for Wilson. Not
withstanding the falling off of Louis
ville and Jefferson county, which on
ly returned a majority for Wilson of
about 500, other districts did their
part nobly, and a splendid majority
was rolled up.
Helm An Easy Winner.
Congressman Harvey Helm was re
turned to the lower House from this
the Eighth district by a majority
which is over 3,500, and may go
larger than the official vote is in. Ev
ery county in the Eighth district
showed up with an increased demo
cratic majority.
The palm must be awarded to Con
gressman Arthur Rouse's 6th district
however, which showed up surpris
ingly well with 10,000 majority, the
greatest it has ever given in its his
tory. Rouse is a splendid fellow in
every way and deserves a large part
of the credit for this fine work.
All of the nine democratic con
gressmen from Kentucky are re
elected and the republicans as well
from the tenth and eleventh districts.
The vote by counties as far as the
I. J. could obtain it by wire up to
10 o'clock Wednesday morning,
was as follogs.

Renewed enthusiasm in the great
work which the federation of women's
clubs is doing all over the state was
eiven to club members of the Eighth
Congressional District, at the district
meeting held in Stanford, Saturday,
November 4th. The District organiza
tion met as the guests of the Woman's
Club of Stanford, young in years of
service, but one of the most active
and enthusiastic, in any small town
hTthe state and with a magnificent
record of accomplishment during its
short life o two and a halt years.
The local organization did all in its
power to make the short stay of its
visitors pleasant and profitable.
The members co-operated beautitui
ly along all lines; committees greeted
the guests on arrival and saw to it
at the luncheon hour that all wre
entertained in dolightful style. Their
guests were pioruse in their compli
ments of the enteitainment provided.
The day was a bcMiitm.l ono ar..i
an unusually large attendance re
sulted, the parking of the scores of
cars about the courthouse, where the
sessions were held, attracting a great
deal of attention. The meetings were
open to the public and many of the
"sterner sex" were presen4"-, and all
were greatly impressed and had many
words of commendation, not only for
the systematic organization and pro
cedure of the convention, but for the
spirit which was so plainly manifest-

the good of mankind and womankind,
a spirit of looking to the uplift of
the home, and the community at
large: Quite a number ofthe men de
clared that they had obtained a new
idea&f the work which the Woman's
Clubare doing, and now stand ready
to, co-operate in whatever way may
be possible toward furthering the

husband, since this convention was
held. Mrs. Riker is a charming
speaker and had many pleasant things
to say to the club members of the
Eighth district, whose good work, she
assured them is indeed appreciated
by the larger organization, the State
Federation, of which the district body
is an integral part.
Dean Mary E. Sweeney, of the
Domestic Science Department of
State University, Lexington, closed
the morning program, with a splen
did address on Domestic Science,
which was indeed appreciated by all.
Dean Sweenev always reaches the
heart of her hearers and she gave
them much to think about before she
concluded.
Adjournment Was taken at the
noon hour until near two o'clock
while the visitors partook of a de
lightful luncheon provided for them
bv their hostesses and served at the
Princess, an attractive little restau
rant. The election of officers for
the next biennial term was gone into
after the convention had reconvened.
Mrs. H. E. Taylor, of Berea, was
chosen District Chairman with Mrs.
Preston " Cornelius, also of Berea.
Secretary. Both nominations and
elections were by acclamation, as it
was Berea's time for the honors, un
der the usual system of rotation
among the various clubs of the dis
trict. The subject of Music and its part
in the work of the clubs was ably
handled by Mrs. James D. Shelby, of
Danville, who is both an experienced
and talented musician and gifted in
the art of imparting her knowledge
to others. ,
Mrs. A. F. Harrison, of Lexington
then spoke on Social Hygiene and
told of the great work which has
been done in Lexington and other
cities to improve the conditions. Mrs.
Harrison is an eloquent and convinc
ing speaker and handled her sub
ject well indeed.
Little Oma Simpson, the 12-year-old
deaf-blind girl, of the Kentucky
School for the Deaf at Danville, who
has so almost miraculously been
taujrht to read, write and talk, un
der the personal tutelage of Miss So
i hia Alcorn, of Stanford, her instruc
tor, was introduced to the conven
tion, and aroused the keenest inter

wonderful training which she has re

The first three counties in Ken

On the early returns from Kan

carried the state bv 24,000.
Claims put out by the Republican
headquarters in New York at mid
night, included only 254 votes. How
ever, they declared enough electoral
votes "would be received. It looks

Illinois and Indiana have failed to

sides claim them, but Hughes, ap

Western states have shown much
more strength for Wilson than be

concluded.
The concluding address of the day
was one of the very best. Miss Lida
Woods, secretary to Dr. Ganfield, at
Danville, and a former assistant to
Mrs. Cora Wilson Stewart, of the
State Illiteracy Commission, told of
the magnificent woi'k which is be
ing done to redeem Kentucky from
the curse of illiteracy and .lgnor-j
ance. Miss Wood; like Mrs. Stewart,
is thoroughly in love with the work,
and she sketched to the club mem
bers the noble part that is theirs to
play in the great work yet ahead.
She deeply and truly impressed ev
eryone by her splendid address.
Reports read from the various
clubs over the Eighth district were
all unusually satisfactory and indi
cated that club work is in a remark
ably healthy and enthusiastic condi
tion at present. Splendid reports
were read from Harrodsburg, Nich

Af terthe invocation by Rev. P. L.
'Bruce of the Presbyterian church, a
cordial welcome was extended to the
visiters -ton hehalf of the Stanford
Womh'tfClrib bwMrs. W. C. Wilson,
CraV4iiS2r-t Mrs," Wilson's remarks
were short but to the point, and it
was a gracious hospitality which she
extended on behalf of the city and
its woman's organization. To this,
Mrs. Preston Cornelius, of Berea, re
soonded, on behalf of the visitors,
giving assurance of their pleasure at
thus assembling in this pretty little
city and expressing appreciation ot
the cordiality of the welcome extend
ed. Upon entering into the formal pro
gram, Miss Amanda Rodes, of Dan
ville, spoke on Conservation and the
part that the Woman's Clubs are tak
ing in this now much discussed sub
in Shp told of the effort to save

purpose by the government. Efforts
toward this have so far failed, but
it is hoped that some public spirited
Kentuckian with the necessary
means,' will be found who will pur
chase this great natural wonder, and
hold it as in trust until a tardy gov
ernment can be brought to see the
wisdom of holding this great natural
phenomenon as a public preserve, ex
actly as is done with Yellowstone
Park and other government parks,
etc.
The important part which the Li
brary plays in the work of a success
ful Woman's Club was dwelt upon
extensively and entertainingly by
Miss Fannie Rawson. One of the
"rmvplinp- lihraries" which is sent
out unde the auspices of the State
Library Commission, represented by
Miss Rawson, was exhibited
at the meeting and she told of the
interest it had awakened wherever it
had been sent. One of the features
of the work of the Stanford Wom
an's Club, it may be stated, has been
the establishment of its free public
library. This has been one of the
most appreciated departments of the
club work here, at all times.
New ideas were given the dele
gates present of the part which the
members of Woman's Clubs can play
in the development and extension of
the educational facilities of the state
by Mrs. Charles P. Weaver, of Louis
ville, in her splendid talk on Educa
tion. Her subject took a wide range,
all of which she covered with thor
oughness and understanding. She
urged that it is proper that the pub
lic be kept or educated through the
press as to what the Woman's Clubs
are doing.
In the place of Mrs. Thomas Jef
ferson Smith, who recently lost her
husband, Mrs.- Will Lillard, of Law
renceburg, spoke on the subject of
"Suffrage," which is becoming such
an important question before the
American people today, and is rapid
ly being made in many quarters a
momentous issue in the life of the
Woman's Clubs' organizations. Mrs.
Lillard is familiar with the subject
and presented it to many in a new
light. ,
Greeting from the State Federa
tion to the Eighth District organiza
tion was then extended by Mrs. La

place of Mrs. Morris Bartlett, of

Mercer county, and now has been
doubly bereaved by the death of her
The November term of the Lincoln
Circuit Court was called to business
at 10:30 Monday morning by Deputy
Sheriff W. S. Embry, who wound up
his impressive prayer with the words:
"God loves the honorable judge and
the Coirn.onwealth." Judge Hardin
was late ai riving, having had auto
troubles en route. A grand jury was
miicklv summoned and before 11 o'
clock he was delivering his charge.
Judge Hardin began by saying that
on the way from his automobile to
the courthouse he was accosted by
three gentlemen, each of whom told
him that blind tiger conditions in
this county are very bad and that
they hoped that something would be
done at this term of court to relieve
the conditions, which are beoming
nljirmintr. The ereater portion cf the
charge was devoted to illegal whisky
selling. Said he, "Soft drink stands
are frequently used as a blind for
selling intoxicants and I ivish yiu
gentlemen who compose the jury to
use every possible effort to bring to
justice the promoters of these enter
prises, who are guilty of low infrac
tions." Referring to a "hop joint"
conducted in Danville some years
ago, Judge Hardin said nearly every
criminal brought before him at a
certain term of court in Boyle was
proven a frequenter of the hop house
and nearly all of the crimes commit
ted were directly chargeable to the
hop joint, which was later put out of
business by a pronioiuve iiuense.
"Look into these hop dispensories.
these soft drink stands thoroughly,"
said the judge, "and see that they
are conducted as they should be."
Judge Hardin stated that his home
town of Harrodsburg had no "near
beer" houses and few soft drink
places and that since the removal of
the former and the decrease numeri
cally of the latter, order is better
and" infractions of the law have great
ly decreased. Judge Hardin explained
the laws against carrying concealed
weapons, hunting out of seasons,
seining and dynamiting, etc., etc.,
and wound up his brief, but forceful
charge bv admonishing the body to
do its full duty and consider not the
time nor the effort it takes. to do
it.
The following centlemen compose
