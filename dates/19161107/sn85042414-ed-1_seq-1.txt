GERMANS TO BE
RESCUED, SAYS
BRITISH NOTE
Denies Report That Orders
Were Issued Not to Res
cue Sub Survivors.
London, Nov. 7.—The admiralty
last night in a published communique
again denies it ever issued orders that
survivors of German submarines were
not be rescued- The communique
Btates that the German press is trying
to make capital out of what they de
scribe as a second Baralong case,
possibly to Incite American opinion
against Great Britain or as a pretext
for an unrestrained submarine cam
paign.
The communique cites the alleged
facts of the case, showing that a Brit
ish auxiliary flying a neutral flag on
September 24, 1915, approached a
German submarine in the western
channel engaging in sinking a British
merchantman. When within range
the auxiliary hoisted a white ensign
and fired on' and sank the submarine
and then rescued the crew of the
merchantman from their boats. When
this was done she also rescued t^o
•ot^th.e submarine's crew who had
climbed Into- a drifting boat.
The communique claims that the
use of a neutral flag was Justifiable,
.as. shown-by the German practice in
the case'of the Moewe and In other
Instances and says that "nobody but
a German could' base an allegation of
'brutality on the lapse of a few min
utes between the^rescue of Britishers
and Germans.
As described by the German ad
miralty the submarine wa*~engaged in
the examination of a steamer in the
neighborhood of the SclIIy islands,
apparently an innocent merchantman
flying an American flag. The steam
mer, according to this account, osten
sibly prepared to lower a boat tout
when the submarine had approached
to within 300 yards the supposed
merchantman suddenly opened con
cealed ports and began firing. The
submarine was sunk but two of the
crew reached the water and swam
for an empty boat. The German ad
miralty alleged the steamer attempted
to ram the boat and the Germans
sprang from it and clung to wreckage
half an hour when the steamer finally
picked them up.

The Herald Will Flash the News by Powerful
Searchlight That Can be Seen For Many Miles
Watch For the Flashes of Light Across the Heavens Every
Fifteen Minutes Until the Returns Show Who
Has Been Elected
The Grand Forks Herald has set no limit in its efforts to serve its readers and
the community in general in the collecting of election returns tonight—in line with
its policy of endeavoring to give the people of North Dakota and Northwestern
Minnesota the best paper published in the northwest.
In addition to securing the Full Leased Wire Service of the greatest news
gathering force of the world—the Associated Press—and establishing an unequaled
system of gathering the results of the election in the state as well, The Herald has
arranged to present to the people of Grand Forks and vicinity the most unique an
nouncement of the election results.
Arrangements have been made with Howard J. Monley of the Light House
for the erection of a huge Electrical Searchlight of 6,000 candle power on the roof of
The Herald building which will flash the news across the sky with such brilliancy
that it can be seen and read from 20 to 50 miles, depending on the atmospheric con
ditions during the evening.
The United States government's signal corps system of wig-wagging will be
utilized in its most simple form cleverly adapted to the occasion to make the signals
intelligible to everybody. The plan is as follows:
Beginning at 8 o'clock, and continuing for two minutes at regular
intervals of every fifteen minutes the powerful flashlight will shoot
across the heavens the results as they appear from the returns at hand
at each period.
The system will be as follows:
The light will flash back and forth across the western sky from
north to south and from south to north. When the returns indicate
that Hughes is in the lead the tight will travel in a straight line. When
it appears that Wilson is in the lead the light will zig-zag up and down
as it travels back and forth. For the benefit of our Minnesota friends,
the same will be repeated in the eastern sky.
When the returns have made it cldar that Hughes has been elected
the light will travel straight up and down directly overhead from east
to M^est and back. .f^-
If thereturnsshouldmakea Wilsoil victory assured the light will
travel straight up and down directly overhead from south to north and
back.
The system is simplicity itself. Just remember a straight flash traveling
back and forth on the horizon between north and south shows that HUGHES IS
LEADING. When the flash forms a waving line of light WILSON IS LEAD
ING. When it is reasonably certain that HUGHES is elected the light will flash
overhead between east-and west. When it is believed WILSON is elected the light
will flash overhead between southland north.^ j:
Watch for The Herald returns tonight jnthe sky.
