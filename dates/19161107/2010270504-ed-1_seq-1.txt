bod Lexington materially and probably
had something to do In North Platte
running up so high a scoro. Tho

Old-Tlmo Courtesy.
Old-fashioned courtesy taught that
deforencp must at all times bo paid
to ago. A hundred years ago llttlo
boys" and girls woro told to "mind
their mannors" If perhaps tho. "doml
nlo'' or the schoolmaster or nnyono
of position or authority spoko to them,
and tho small lads would bow deeply
and tho tiny maids would curtsy most
respectfully. Such airs and graces,
pretty though they woro, would bo,
out of placo in our moro strenuous
times. Yot thero Is no reason why
our young peoplo's fiiannors should
not bo aB good, if of necessity less
formal, than thoso of our ancestors.

Beetlea of Prey.
Many booties aro bugs of jrpy. Pre
daccous insects generally havo won
dorful nppotltes. Tho so-callotj "green
fly," otherwise popularly known as
"golden-eyes," Is, as a larva, a tre
mendous gobbler of plant lice. It
thinks nothing of devouring ,100 of
thorn, ono aftor another, at a meal.
Thus insects themselves do much to
kocp tho numbers of othor Insects
down. But not oven with their aid,
nor with nil our ingenuity in dovlsing
methods of destruction, could we main
tain a successful fight against Injuri
ous bugs wero it not for tho help given
by birds.
