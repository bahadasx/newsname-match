HARD FIGHTING IN FRANCE
Germans Appear to Have Held Their
Lines In Spite of Fierce Assults
From French and British.
After a week or more of doubt
concerning the operations in the
Dobrudja region of Rumania, where
the forces of the Teutonic allies had
teen inarching almost unimpeded
northward across the province from
the Black sea to the Danube, comes
the report that the Rumanians have
now taken the offensive, probably
aided by Russians, and compelled the
Teutonic allies to retreat et several
points.
On the Transylvanian front, how
ever, the Rumanians In the Jlul valley
who lor some time had been holding
the upper hand over the Austro-Ger-nians,
forcing them to give ground,
have now been stopped, the Teutons
having brought up reinforcements. In
the Tredeal pass region, after heavy
fighting, the Rumanians also have met
with a reverse, being compelled to re
treat after long and stubborn battles.
All along the battle line in France,
between the Somme and Ancre rivers,
the Germans are tenaciously disputing
attempts by the British and French
to gain further ground. Berlin says
that In Sunday's fighting over a
front of 12 miles the French 'and
British suffered heavy casualties and
won nothing except a local gain in the
St. Pierre Vaast wood. London admits
that the British were compelled to
tve back to the Germans part of the
ground they had previously won at
the Butte de Warleucourt. In the St.
fieri Vaast wood, - however, . th
French, Monday, made a further ad
vance in the northern part of the wood
and captured additional prisoners, 600
of whom were taken in the fighting of
Sunday and yesterday.
Rome reports that the Austrians are
bringing up heavy reinforcements on
the battle front north of Trieste. Here
the Austrians apparently have taken
the offensive, but nowhere have they
been able to regain any of their lost
positions, according to Rome.
London, Nov, 6. A British subma
rine operating in the North Sea re
ports that she fired torpedoes at a Ger
man battleship of the dreadnaught
type yesterday, making a hit. The
amount of damage inflicted is not
known ,the Admiralty announces. The
announcement follows:
I "One of our submarines operating
in the North Sea reports that she fired
torpedoes at a German battleship of
the dreadnaught type near the Danish
coast yesterday. The vessel was hit.
The amoant of damage Is unknown."
London, Nov 6. Lloyd's announces
that the steamship Lanao, described
by the shipping agency as an Ameri
can vessel, wai sunk on Oct. 28 by a
submarine. (The Lanao was recently
transferred from American to Norwe
gian registry.) Thirty men from the
Lanao were landed at Barry by the
Norwegian steamship Tromp.
German submarines have been ac
tive for some weeks oft the Spanish
coast, where the Lanao seems to have
.been sunk. One submarine command
er was credited with the statement
that he had received orders to sink all
vessels bound for England. Spanish
vessels, It Is said, were later exempted
on undertaking to carry nothing but
fruit.

himself directly in front of the muzzle
of the gun receiving the entire charge
in his head.

BETTING ODDS EVEN
New York Odds at Midnight Swing
From Hughes.
New York. Nov. 7. After a da
marked by fluctuating odds, during
which those on President Wilson
slowly but surely shortened, election
betting on the Presidential race was
at even money in the big uptown
hotels at midnight this morning. At
the Waldorf Tex Rickard, a betting
commissioner, placed los of mo'iey at
that figure. One bet of $ 10,000 was
recorded, and there were several
$1,000 bets.
There excitement and not a little
confusion marked the final beilinir
At the finish of the greatest day's
betting ever recorded In this city on a
Presidential election, the Curb eloped
yesterday afternoon with odds of pi
to 8 In favor of Hughes. Between
$800,000 and $500,000 was bet the
Curb. Some estimates were that, in
cluding large sums which were placed
quietly by Stock Exchange fir.iu, by
betting commissioners In hotels and
cafes, and large private bets, the total
sum staked here yesterday was aVnu
$1,000,000.
The Wall Street betting favj: He has
always won a Presidential 'lection,
and at the close yesterday Hughes was
the favorite, but the backers of l'ro.-l-dent
Wilson took comfort from the
fact that the betting on the last ("ay
showed a trend in favor of '.heir candi
date. This never happened befoi-.?.
In 1892 the betting fluctuated on the
last day before election, but ha I oocn
uncertain all through the campaign,
and ended virtually at even money.

NO MORE DOE KILLING
Law Protects Female Deer andJJn
pronged Fawns
Tho deer hunting season which
opens at So'clock on the morning of
Nov. 13 and continues to 5 o'clock in
the afternoon of Dec. 5 I. to be differ
ent from recent hunting seasons in
that the shooting of does will be pro
hibited. The legislative session of
1 ill 5 amended the fish and game law
of the state, permitting both bucks
and does to be killed during that year
(1915) but prohibiting the slaughter of
does thereafter. Moreover, the law
stipulates that the wild deer to be
taken must have horns not 'less than
three inches in length.
Therefore, the hunters who are mak
ing their plans to go into the woods of
Vermont during the P.1G season need
to bear these stipulations in mind lest
they lay themselves liable to prosecu
tion. We do not think the change in
the law has become sufficiently well
known throughout the whole state as
yet; and hence from this time forth
unusual publicity ought to be given to
the law relating to deer hunting. The
main feature to proseht is that does
are protected, the second that bucks
must have horns not less than three
inches in length, the third that hunt
ing is restricted to the hours between
5 a. ni. and 5 p. m., the fourth that
Sunday hunting if prohibited, the fifth
that the season runs from the morn
ing of Nev. 15 to the afternoon of Dec.
5, and the sixth that the killing of
fawns Is forbidden. Brattleboro Re

MANY CONTESTS BEFORE VOTERS
Governors, Senators, Members of
Congress and Legislatures To Be
Chosen in Most States.
New York, Nov. 7. Political man
agers of both the leading parties end
ed their work last night expressing
confidence as to the result of today's
voting. Vance C. McConnick, Chair
man of the Democratic National Com
mittee, insisted that President Wil
son would get not less than 364 of the
031 votes in the Electoral College.
William R. Willcox of the Republi
can National Committee was just as
certain that the majority for Charles
E. Hughes would be not less than 100
electoral votes.
Voters today cast their ballots for
presidential' and, vice presidential
electors, for 32 United States Sena
tors, one-third of the members of that
body (Maine has already elected two
republican senators) for the entire
membership of the House of Repre
sentatives, besides state and minor
officials throughout the United States.
Though tho election of a president
naturally is of greatest Interest, con
tests for state officers In many parts
of the country are expected to poll
the strength of all parties.
Women will be accorded the priv
ilege of voting for presidential elec
tors iu the states of Wyoming, Colora
do, Utaii, Idaho, Washington, Califor
nia. Arizona, Kansas, Oregon, Mon
tana, Nevada and Illinois.
Vermont bears tho distinction of be
ing the only state in the Union which
lias given its electoral vote to the re
publican presidential and vice presi
dential candidates since the organiza
tion of the party i.n 1856. Until the
break in 1912, when the progressives
ran Roosevelt, several other states
held the same record.
Ten southern states have not failed
since 1870 to give their electoral votes
to the democratic party. Though it is
of rare occurrence, a stale can divide
Its electoral vote. There are several
instances on ree-ord. In three or four
instances the candidate receiving the
smaller popular vote secured the elec
tion by receiving a majority of the
votes In the electoral college.

The Banner office will be open from
7.30 this evening until the result is

result is in doubt.All those who are
interested arej invited to call at The
Banner office or to telephone in
quiries at any time.
If the result is a landslide the result
will be known early while if It Is
close returns will be of little value
until late in the evening. Reliable in
dications are not probable before 9.30
to 12 o'clock through in 1904 the very
first returns were so decisive that
they left no doubt of the result.
As has been the custom for the past
28 years at national elections, Griswold
will announce the result of today's bal
lot by the explosion of bombs. Two
reports will indicate that Hughes is
the choice of the ieople. while three
shots will tell of a Wilson victory. The
shells will be fired on the even hour

certain.

ELECTOR COMMITS SUICIDE
Missouri Republicans Name Man to
Fill Vacancy on Ballot.
Frank B. Buhr. republican candi
date lor presidential elector from the
10th Missouri district, committed sui
cide at St. Louis, Mo., yesterday,
thereby having a vacancy on the re
publican ballot. The republican state
committee met and nominated Henry
Iterating to fill the vacancy.
The nomination of Kersting was too
late to get on the official ballot, and
republican voters will be urged to
write in the name. It Is not thought
possible, however, that this informa
tion will reach all the voters of the
state, and it Is predicted that thou
sands will vote for the dead man. The
death of Ruhr and the llth-hour nom
ination of Kersting, It is thought, may
result In a division of the republican
vote for elector in the 10th district,
and even if Hughes' carries the state
it is possible that a democrat will be
elected In that district. In that event
Missouti will cast 17 votes for Hughes
and one lor Wilson. Should the state
go democratic, the death of Ruhr will
have no effect in the electoral college.
One hundred and eighty thousand
slips bearing the name of Kersting for
elector were printed last night and
will be sent to the St. Louis polling
placets this morning. The judges will
be instructed to paste them on the
ballots.
