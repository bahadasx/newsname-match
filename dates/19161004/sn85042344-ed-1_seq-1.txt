Influenced to believe, so he says, from
an bllo remark ot an Irresponsible
fortune teller that he was guilty of

The suits for a total of $250,000 will
allege that the nine persons, all but
one of them old residents of this
county, sought to bold Jones respon
sible for the eight illisca ax murders
of June 1912, In 'lo homo ot J II.
Moore, Jones' business competitor.
"Sumo clairvoyant had made the
silly statement that Moore's murderer
would witness the funeral from h's
homo whllo reading a paper," Jones
said tonight. "By accident I was on
my front porch reading a paper when
Joo Moore's funeral procession passed.
Reports that I was responsible for tho
murder followed and tho fact that I
was Joe Moo o ii liuslnom rival lent
color to the sto-y In the or.nlnn of

After the legislature-.
At least four Republican congress
men will be eleeteii this fall. The
Republicans confidently expect to se
cure control of tho state legislature
and thereby break up the political
muchino that has cursed Oklahoma
for many moons. "Iiok at your lax
receipt," Is the slogan of the b gisla
tlve candidates and If they are elected
tboy are pledged to th-3 enactment of
fair laws that will reduce taxes and
bring about a rnoro efficient adminis
tration of government than has ever
before been known
Party leaders believe that the fair
election law- will be adopted at the No
vember election bv a vote as large as
was recorded against the late lament
ed literacy tent amendment. This
measure Is so eminently fair and so
sure to wlp out the last vestige of a
"machine" that honest voters of all
political faiths will rally to Its sup
port. It provides for representation
tij-on the state election board by Die
threo dominant parties. j

CONVICTS Iroin the slate peniten

consideration by the county commis
sioners for some time and they xxlll
meet this morning lo perfect arran:;e
metit.s for bringing the convicts lu-t n.
The rock crusher of the idd Port
land Cement company three m.i.-s
west of the city will be leased by the
county and the convict worked there
undor tho direction of an experlenc.nl
foreman. About twenty-flic coiua-'s
xvtll be used at first.
A stato law allows counties to use
prisoners from the penitentiary for
road work upon application to the
state highway department. The only
cost to the county Is the board und
transportation of the oonvlctH.
Tulsa county has been buying
crushed rock from the two prlvatolx
owned rock crushers located In this
city. With the county operating !ts
oxvn crusher the cost of tills class of
road material will be greatly reduced.
Method More Rapid.
A more rapid method of transport
ing all kinds of road matellal Is nbio
under consideration of the county
commissioners. Teams und xxagons
are proving Inadequate In hauling
rock, sand and cement to the high-
Ways being constructed In various
parts of the county. To take th-lr
place tho commlsslonei s propose to
install ii system of tractors and
trailers. H Is estimated that such a
svstem could move the road material
ten times as fast as the present
method of horse-drawn vehicles. Also
the cost would he much less.
Tho most perfect system of roads
In the intliH stale Is that of Tulsa
coiintv. Improvements planned for
many of the highways have not yet
been put Into effect but If the work
ol' the present board of commisslon
i is Is kept up this county will have
a road system not even surpassed by
counties In California, the banner
road slate of tho nation. A feature
of Tulsa county roads Is the absence
of long grades and high points, serl
ius Impediments of travel.
Tuloii road boosters are taking an
active Interest In promoting better
highways At Ihelr Invitation Oov

provided a fund by which money Is
impropriated for roads In every
county where road building Is In
progress.
Tho distribution of the fund Is
under the direction of the state high

Ihe county applying for aid Is sit
uated Counties which are willing
to spend a similar amount to that
asked from tin- government and who
can give guarantees that tho roads

they are built will receive first con
