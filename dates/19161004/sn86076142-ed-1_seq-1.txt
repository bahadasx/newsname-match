VIOLENT FIGHTING CONTINUES ALONG
THE LINE TO BANKS OF THE DANUBE
Neither Russian Nor Teutonic Allies
Gain Advantage in Heavy Fight
ing That is Progressing West of
LutskOreek Cabinet Favors War.
(Ily Aaaorlnled Preaa.)
Although Rumanians continue to
gain against Austro-Germans In Tran
sylvania, the situation in Dobruilju,
which has attained added Importance
since the crossing of the Danube into
Bulgaria by Rumanian forces, re
mains uncertain.
Bucharest says violent fighting con
tinues all along the line from Con
stanza to the Danube, with the Teu
tonic allies offering stubborn reslst
snce. .Nothing Is vouchsafed, how
ever, concerning the troops which
Invaded Bulgaria.
Sofia says that only "several bat
talions" of Rumanians made their
way across the river, and Berlin re
ports the destruction behind them,
by German monitors, of the pontoon
bridges over which they passed. An
unofficial dispatch from Hume asserts
that Held Marshal von Mac.kensen
has ordered the evacuation of the
Dobrudja fortress of Silistria, and
Turtukai, recently captured by the
' Teutonic allies, in the fear that they
will be enveloped by the Rumanians.
Rains are interfering with the ac

armies In Frauce, but Paris records

additional prisoners, while London

HANDS SHAKEN BY
FORMER PRESIDENTS
according to Petrograd, neither Rus
sians nor Teutonic allies have gained
marked advantage. West of LutHk,
according to I'etrograd, Russians
made advances, but Berlin reports
that all attacks here were repulsed,
the Russians suffering exceptionally
heavy casualties. In the attacks,
says Berlin, the Russian guard made
seventeen unsuccessful onslaughts
and another division made twelve.
In Macedonia, Sofia admits that
heavy artillery fire of the Serbs In
the region of Kaimakicalan heights
caused Bulgarians to withdraw to
the Moglenlca valley, In order to
avoid unnecessary losses, but asserts
that entente attacks elsewhere along
the front were repulsed.
In Albania, according to an Athens
dispatch, Italian military authorities
have occupied Argyro Castro, having
ordered the Greek military officers
to evacuate the town.
Kxcept for the capture by Italians
of two lofty peaks from Austrlans
and a continuation of heavy bombard
ment by Austrlans of the Carso front,
there has been little activity In the
Austro Italian theater.
The Ureek situation continues to
develop. King Constantino, accord
ing to an Athens dispatch, has in
his hands the resignation of the
members uf the cabinet except those
of the premier and the foreign min
ister. It is probable that the new
cabinet will contain several siii

"How do you do," said Mr. Taft.
"How do you do," Mr. Roosevelt

Each bowed and Mr. Roosevelt

those who followed. A few moments
later Mr. Roosevelt took his place
to the receiving line. He stood be

Thus, ttandlng In the same receiv

evening. They did not meet again,
however, qj exchange any other word
than commonplace greeting.
"W'e shook hands," Mr. Taft said
afterwards, "Just like any gentlemen

Colonel Roosevelt declined to com

Last evening the Republican county
central committee held a meeting,
which had been adjourned from Sat
urday evening, for the purpose of
nominating a candidate for the office
of county clerk, to fill the vacancy
caused by the resignation of Robert
tl. I'ohl, the incumbent. This meet
ing had not been given the proper
publicity, which would have brought
results from distant portions of the
county, where good timber could
have been produced for this office.
The writer of this article views
this meeting last night as one of
the "rockroller" kind. The "rock
rollers" were there with steam up
and the roller was sent forward with
all of its speed and they put in nomi
nation one E. B. Paxson, formerly
of the Postal Telegraph company.
The no'mlntion went through with
only three dissenting votes.
His opponent was C. J. Brown,
who has been a trusted employe of ,
the Tonopuh Mining company for the
past eight years, and had he been
nominated would have been elected,
owing to his popularity among the
working classes. It was evident that
the county central committee did
not approve of recognizing one who
has delved in the mines for many
years and who is qualified to fill this
position. Mr.' Paxson cannot be
elected to this officee owing to the
fact that Mr. Pohl, during his illnesB
was prevailed upon to draw down so
that Mr. Paxson could be made the
candidate. Today, should Mr. Pohl
come out as an independent candi
date, he would be re-elected by an
overwhelming majority.
The writer of this article Is a Re
publicannot a "Dolly Vardon" poll
tlcian who believes in putting up a
stick for any office. The Bonanza
will not support Mr. Paxson. It be
lieves that he Is not the man for the
office. In the next Issue this puper
will have more to say regarding the
resignation of Mr. Pohl and of those
who brought It about.

PEKIN, Oct. 4. Russia's demand
that representatives of Outer Mon
golia shall not be permitted to sit in
the Chinese parliament is an indica
tion that Russia does not intend to
slacken the hold which it obtained
upon Outer Mongolia through its
treaty with China recognizing the
autonomy of Outer Mongolia Insofar
as domestic affairs are concerned.
With Japan encroaching upon Inner
Mongolia, as is indicated by the
recent riot at Chenghiatun, and with
Russia pressing in on Outer Mon
golia, Chinese officials are especially
uneasy about the intentions of these
two powers, particularly in the light
of the recent Russo-Japanese treaty
n which the two countries agree not
to interfere with each other's "spe
cial Interest" in the far east.
Prince Koudacheff, the Russian
minister, represented to the foreign
office that Outer Mongolia being an
autonomous government naturally
should not participate in the Chinese
parliament but should have its own
sembly of its own to direct its own
internal affairs.
Chinese officials have, apparently,
never conceded the absolute auto
nomy of Outer Mongolia. The for
eign office is unwilling to admit that
the members designated to represent
Mongolia when parliament 'taa first
convened in 1913 should not now
take their seats. Furthermore, the
question is raised as to the validity
of the Russo-Japanese treaty granting
utonomy to Outer Mongolia. Repub
lican leaders say the treaty is not;
valid, as Yuan Shikai negotiated
without the ratification of parliament. I
Originally twelve Outer Mongolian
senators aud fifteen Mongolian rep
resentatives were designated to sit
in the two house of parliament.
Ten were Chinese, tve Mancb.ua and
twelve afoagultaua.
