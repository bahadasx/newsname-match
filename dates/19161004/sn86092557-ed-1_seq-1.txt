Anti-Suffrage Address Was
Interesting to Audience
Last Night.
One of the largest crowds seen recently
at a political gathering in this
city turned out last night and filled
the Grand Theatre even to standing
room to hear Mrs. O. D. Oliphant of
New Jersey, deliver her anti-suffrage
address.
In an able and Interesting talk she
attacked the arguments of the suffrage
advocates and bofore the meeting
was concluded she had converted many
temporarily to her cause. Mrs. Oliphant
was introduced by Ex-Governor
A. B. Fleming, whose wif0 is one of
the honorary presidents of the state
anti-suffrage organization.
Mrs. Oliphant. in her address which
consumed two hours, beginning at 8
oclock denied the charges of the suffragists
that she was supported by thc
liquor interests of the country. She
pointed out that the failure of woman
suffrage to accomplish any noticeable
good in California. Colorado nnd the
other states that now nave equal suffrage.
She stated that the majority
of the women of the nation in her opln
ion did not desire to vote and would
rather remain at home and devote
their energies to home life rather than
participate in political affairs.
Speaking of the relations betweon
men and women and their attitude toward
government Mrs. Oliphant said:
"The interest of classes differ but the
Interests of man and woman are identical.
Perhaps the woman carries the
heavier responsibility because she
bears, rears and trains the future republic
of this nation. A nation will
never rise higher than home life. In
the hands of the American woman rest
the destiny of this nation for she
'moulds and trains the character of
the fuutre citizens of this republic
and I contend tonight that it is a far
greater; far finer service to put the
quality into the future citizenship than
to walk down the street on election
day and vote for the alderman of your
ward. We cannot have both. We contend
that women contribute more to
tho state in service that men cannot
render and that it 1b for the best interest
of the state tbat she concentrate
all her interests along these lines
which she alone can contribute."

I City Hall Notes '
^ i
Insurance rate agents are In the !
city today looking into the fire hazards
about the city and how best the
firemen can handle them. The rate
of insurance in Fairmont which has
a paid fire department, two fire trucks, :
a fire chiefs car. two hook and ladder :
wagons, is greater than tho rate of Insurance
for Morgantown which has !
no paid department other than a $75
a month man to look after the hose ;
wagons and horses. The reason for '
this Is not known and it Is this difference
in rates that has caused the ;
city commission to Investigate the :
matter.
Tomorrow is pay day at the fire department
and the city hall. The pay roll
this month will be one of the largest
in several months on account of
the extra amount of work on the
streets In the sewer departments.
City Clerk Kern Is sending out spec- i

Capacities.
W. H. Veach, Republican candidati
for sheriff 0t Marion county, is a trui
representative of native West Virgin
Ian and his family name has loni
been suggestive of the early pionee;
days in this state. The first Veach ii
this county was Benjamin Veach. grea
grandfather of the present candidate
who came here with Nathaniel Coch
rane in 1875. Cochrane Is remember
ed as the man who was captured l>;
the Indians and kept prisoner for ;

Fairmont State Normal school. Hi
was born March 10. ISfili and htrough
out his career has been active in bus
iness and public life and a lifelonf
supporter of the Republican prinicl
pies.
For many years he was engaged ii
the mercantile business at both Farm
ington and Mannlngton. lie served ai
postmaster at Farmlngton for fou:
years and three months and served oni
year aR prestdent of the Lincoln die
trict Board of Education, having beei
appointed to fill a vacancy. He serv
ed the county as a member of thi
state legislature in 1909. Mr. Veacl
in active in both church and fratema
affairs and has been a nearnest qule
worker a reputation of accom
plishing things. The only time hi
was ever defeated for an elective of
flee was IS years ago when he was thi
Republican candidate for county com
missioner.
This year he was reluctantly per
suaded to accept the nomination to
sheriff but when his friends bad se
cured his selection in the primaries
he accepted and with his characteris
tic determination to accomplish thingi
he is now quietly engaged In a thor

is worth doing at all it should be doni
well he is now spending his ontlre timi
in the campaign. He has promised t(
give the taxpayers of the county ai
honest and faithful effort to adminis

who have known him and had buslnesi
