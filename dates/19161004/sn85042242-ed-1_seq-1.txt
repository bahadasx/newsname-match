Republican Candidate for Gov
ernor Delivers Stirring
Address
EQUITABLE PRICES FOR
MARKETING GRAIN ISSUE
Middle Man Must Be Eliminated
For Benefit of Farmers
and All
BV STAFF CORRESPONDENT
Lynn J. Frazier Republican can­
didate for governor, addressed a
good-sized gatthering of voters at
Mandan yesterday afternoon In a
spirited speech in which he praised
the Non-Partisan league and all can­
didates running for office on that
party ticket, and claimed that when
these candidates were placed in of­
fice the government of the state of
North Dakota would be bettered ten
fold.
Inclement weather frustrated the
plans of politicial leaders and others
in charge of affairs and Mr. Frazier
did not deliver his address at the
fair grounds as was contemplated. In­
stead he spoke from an automobile
stationed in front of the Commercial
Club rooms on Main street.
Introduced By H. E. Behrens
The gubernatorial candidate was in­
troduced by H. E. Behrens, one of
the organizers of the Non-Partisan
league.
Immediately after the introduction
a lengthy ovation was tendered the
farmer's candidate. The majority of
his speech was devoted to explaining
the platform of the Non-Partisan lea­
gue and the efforts being made by all
candidates at this early stage of the
game to uphold the issues at stake.
Equitable Prices For Marketing.
"Equitable prices for marketing
home products is the main conten­
tion of thp Npn-Partisan league," as­
serted Mr. F'rasier. "For many years
grains and other products raised in
North Dakota have been shipped to
Minnesota and that state has been
the Recipient of the credit for these
products. We must eliminate the mid­
dle-man!. It is time to boost for the
farmers, their crop and .best of all
our great state of North Dakota.
°I firmly believe that a good, hon­
est civil service act should be pass
ed so that examinations must be tak­
en by candidates for appointive of­
fices and thus efficient men be placed
in these positions. By this method
all concerned would be benefitted.
Eliminate the Middle-Man.
"Year after year the profits derived
by the middle-man from North Dakota
farmers approximate $55,000,000. This
money is being taken from the state
when there is absolutely no reason
why it should not be kept within the
boundary lines and the farmers of
North Dakota derive the benefit of
this amount. The money that goes
out of the state every year on the
,Jwheat
crop alone, divided among the
farmers of North Dakota, would give
approximately $1,000. per year to each
tiller of the soil. The farmers are
poor enough without being robbed of
their just due. The middle-man takes
the cream of the profit and also the
credit. Why should not the farmers,
consumers and all concerned receive
what rightfully belongs to them?
"In my mind there is no reason why
every businessman in North Dakota,
in fact etery resident of this great
state, should not co-operate and place
the farmers in a position where they
can get the best prices and also the
best profit from their products. When
the farmers are prosperous, business,
as well as the people, also find condi­
tions improved. This is sufficient rea­
son for the maintenance of a slogan,
'Boost the Farmer and You Will Boost
Your Own Interests.'"
Three Evening Addresses.
Last evening three addresses were
delivered to the voters of Mandan and
surrounding vicinity. Mr. Frazier
spoke to a large crowd at the
Bowery tent on .Main street, while
H. E. Behrens talked to a gathering
of railroaders in the Commercial Club
rooms, delivering his famous speech,
"Railroad and the Railroaders."
Immediately after Mr. Frazier com­
pleted his talk he went to the Com­
mercial Club rooms, where he also
addressed the railroad men.

ENGAGE EXPERT
Federal Engineer Will Construct
Fill Through McKenzie
Slough
J. H. Dodge, the federal road ex­
pert who supervised the construction
of the splendid piece of highway on
the Red Trail west of Mandan, prob­
ably will be engaged by the Burleigh
county board to supervise the con­
struction of the fill through the fam­
ous McKenzie slough. Mr. Dodge
will accompany the County commis­
sioners to the scene of operations to­
day. An elevating grader has been
employed for some time in building
the big fill at that point, and the em­
ployment of the federal engineer to
complete this important piece of
work is expected to insure a perma­
nent improvement of real value to the
Red Trail.
It is planned to make the grade
high enough and wide enough to meet
ordinary conditions.
Aside from the discussion of roads,
the board confined its attention to
routine matters yesterday. Practical­
ly all of today will be devoted to the
inspection of roads.

further efforts today to find public
gambling, evidence of which Federal
Judge Landis was drawing in detail
from unwilling witnesses in his court.
A spectacular raid on a West Side

sons, one of them a woman, being
captured. The police burst through a
locked door and found an excited
group, money in hands, just hearing

Street Cars Collide and Drop

PROVES A HEROINE
Death List May Be Increased
Owing to Sertous Injuries
Received by Many
Cleveland, O., Oct. 3.—Two persons
were killed and liaore than 30 are in
hospitals, as the toll of a bridge trag­
edy early this evening, when two
street cars collided on the West Third
street bridge, causing it to collapse,
and precipitate the cars 30 feet to
the Baltimore & Ohio railroad tracks.
The dead arecrr. Mrs. Clara Dille,
a passenger, and'Otto Borcbert, mo
torman.
Sixty Persons in Wreck.
There were 40 persons on one car
and 20 on the other. It was at first
believed that the death list, would
reach 20, but later it was found that,
while dozens were hurt, only a few
had been killed.
The accident occurred when a
southbound Scranton road car, carry­
ing a crowd of women shoppers home,
at the rush hour, broke away from
the inotorman on a hill approaching
the bridge just as a northbound car
reached the same point. The runaway
car jumped the track and struck the
northbound car. The combined weight
of the two cars and the shock of the
collision was too much for the wood­
en bridge, which sagged and then
gave way.
Operator is Heroine.
Edna Waddington, a telephone op­
erator, employed by the Erie railroad,
saw the accident from where she sat
at her switchboard and turned in a
call for ambulances, doctors and the
fire department
Hundreds within earshot of the
scene heard the shrieks and cries of
pain and terror as the cars carried
their burden to death injury.
1
The work*of rescue began at once.
Those who had not been seriously
injured extricated themselves and
gave aid to the less fortunate. It was
not long until 30 had been taken out
and carried to hospitals. Some are
probably fatally injured and the death
list will undoubtedly be swelled from
this source.
Will Conduct Inquiry.
Mayor Harry L. Davis and Public
Utilities Director Thomas F. Farrell
rushed to the scene and promised to
conduct a strict inquiry in an effort
to place the responsibilty for the dis
aster.
GERMAN AMBASSADOR WILL
CALL ON PRES. WILSON
Long Branch, X. J., Oct. 3.—Count
von Bernstorff, German ambassador
to the United States, will call on
President Wilson here next Monday,
it was announced tonight, before Mr.
Wilson starts on his western trip at
8:30 o'clock.
It is presumed the ambassador will
present a personal letter from the
emperor to Mr. Wilson, replying to
autograph messages sent by the Pres­
ident to the rulers of several Euro­
pean nations, urging that a method be
agreed upon for getting relief sup­
plies to starving people in Poland.
It has been reported that the Ger­
man reply does not tend to bring
about an agreement.
FILE MORE PETITIONS
FOR COUNTY DIVISION
Two petitions for a division of Mor­
ton county were filed yesterday with
County Auditor Lee Xichols. One is
the official request for the Washnig
ton county division, which has been
given much publicity.
The other is for Lincoln county,
with the plan of securing a county
seat for Flasher. Dr. Geo. A. Speil
man. Attorney R. H. Neely, A. R.
Middleman and J. W. Stevenson pre
esnted the Lincoln petition. This
calls for a new county along the line
directly west from the Missouri river
and one mile north of St Anthony.
This runs west to the line between
Ranges 86 and S7, and thence south
to the Cannon Ball river. The pro­
posed Lincoln county cut-off includes
Carson, Brisbane, St. Anthony, Flash­
er, Timmer and all other towns in
that district.

Grand Rapids, Mich.1, Oct. 3.—James
Allen, 64 years old, broke down late
today under a severe grilling and con­
fessed, according to Sheriff Berry,
that he murdered Mrs. Hannah St.
John, 67 years old, of Mayfield, New
[York, in a lonely woods near here.
jThe woman's body was found in the
'woods Sunday by two boys.
Allen, who it is said, used the names
James Allerton, and John Williams,
is alleged to have confessed he mar­
ried Mrs. St. John shortly after her
arrival here, May 19th, and shortly
after their marriage he took her into
the woods and killed her with a re­
volver. He is said to have confessed
that after shooting Mrs. St. John he
took what money she had in a hand­
bag.
WINS FIRST CAR
Max Walker Soon To Be Proud
Possessor of Wonder, Auto­
mobile
Probably the happiest boy'in Wash­
burn today is Master Max Wacker,
son of Adolph Wacker of the McLean
County Abstract and Title company,
who has just been advised that his
"B-Cee Light Eight," the juvenile car
that's "just like dad's," has been ship?
ped from the factory at. Battle Creek,
Mich.
Master Wacker was the first Mis­
souri Slope boy to win one of these
wonder cars by turning in new sub­
scriptions for the Tribune. Seventy
youngsters are diligently at work, and
the fact that Max was the first to
cross the line augurs well for his suc­
cess in later years. The Washburn
young man mailed to the Tribune of­
fice 13 subscriptions, the mystic num­
ber in this instance proving a lucky
one. Other juvenile solicitors are
nearing the needed number, and very
soon the "13-Cee Light Eight" will be
as familiar to central North Dakota
folk as are other standard makes of
cars for "grown-ups."

passengers over the river, and for
new and substantial landings.
Charles Staiey, immigration agent
of the Soo Line, has gone east on an
extended business trip, to include
points in Minnesota and Iowa.
SUBSTANTIATE CHARGES.
Washington, Oct. 3.—The special
war department board, which investi­
gated military aeronautics, reported
today that its inquiry not only sub­
stantiated allegations of inefficiency
on the part of army officers, but clear­
ly established that development of
this branch of the service "is being
conducted with energy and fore­
sight."

"norther" of the season struck the
Dakota camp Thursday night and the
boys commenced to scramble for
their extra blankets. Little rain fell,
or rather blew, with it, however, and
though the change of temperature
from 70 degrees to 50 occurred in
about three minutes, it did not get
cold enough to make it uncomfort­

General Frederick Funston, com­

Bucharest Claims Allies Are Of*

Along the Danube
INCLEMENT WEATHER
ON THE SOMME FRONT
Violent Fighting in Progress in
Russia in the Galicia
Region
London, Oct. 3.—Although the Rou
manians continue to gain ground
against the Austro-Germans at vari*
ous points in Transylvania, the situa­
tion in Dobrudja, which has attained
added interest since the crossing of
the Danube intd Bulgaria by Rouma
nian forces, remains uncertain,
Bucharest says that violent fighting
continues all along the line, south of
the railroad running from Constanta
to the Danube, with the Teutonic al­
lies offering stubborn resistance to
the Roumanian and Russian forces.
Destroy Pontoon Bridge*.
Sofia says that only "several bat­
talions" of Roumanians made their
way across the river, and Berlin re­
ports the destruction behind them, by
German monitors, of the pontoon
bridges over which they passed.
An unofficial dispatch from Rome
asserts that Field Marshal von Mack
ensen has ordered the evacuation of
the Dobrudja fortresses of Sillstria
and Turtukai, recently captured by
the Teutonic Allies, in the fear of
their being enveloped by the Rouma­
nians.
Inclement Weather Near Somme.
Heavy rains are interfering with
the activities of the British and the
French armies in the Somme region
of France, but nevertheless Paris re­
cords the capture of an important
trench north of Rancourt and the tak­
ing of additional prisoners, while Lon­
don says the fighting at Eaucourt
l'Abbaye "is*~ proceeding satisfactor­
ily."
Violent Fighting in Russia.
Violent fighting has been in prog­
ress in Russia, west of Lutsk, and in
Galicia, in the region of the Zlota
Lipa river. West of Lutsk, according
to Petrograd, the Russians made ad­
vances, but Berlin reports that all at­
tacks were repulsed, the Russians suf­
fering exceptionally heavy casualties.
Berlin records an advance by the
Austro-Germans against the British,
who recently crossed the Struma,
northwest of Lake Tahinos, while un­
official advices from Paris say the
Bulgarians have abandoned several
positions in the Starkov, Grob and
Brod river regions, and that four
towns northeast of Fiorina in Greece
have been occupied by the Entente
Allies.
Italians Register Gain.
In Albania, according to an Athens
dispatch, the Italian military authori­
ties have occupied Argyro Castro,
having ordered the Greek military of­
ficials there to evacuate the town.
Except for the capture by the Ital­
ians of two lofty peaks held by the
Austrians and a continuation of the
heavy bombardment by the Austrians
of the Castro front, in the hands of
the Italians, there has been little ac­
tivity in the Austro-Italian theatre.
Greek Situation Developing.
The Greek situation continues to
develop. King Constantin, according
to an Athens dispatch, has in his
hands the resignations of the mem­
bers of the cabinet, except those of
the premier and the foreign minister.
Fargo, N. D., Oct. 3.—M. P. Johnson
of Tolley, president of the North Da­

the stat'e tonight, after speaking nine
weeks in Kentucky, directing the
Equity campaign among the tobacco
growers.
Organization work similar to that
carried on among the grain farmers
of the northwest is being employed.
That the tobacco growers are not
realizing the proper prices for prod­
ucts because of the system of grad­
ing and selling, which gives the pro­
ducer no voice in the transaction, is
Johnson's view of the tobacco farm­
er's problem.
TWO KILLED WHEN

Onawa, la., Oct 3.—L. L. Farley,
Sioux City stockbroker, and Maurice
Kelliher, Jr., Rapid City, 8. D„ were
killed when the roadster in which they
