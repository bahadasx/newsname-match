After trimming the feathers and
otherwise disguising their mascot
eigle. the United States Marines
attached to the American Legation
ar Peking China, recently succeed
ed in
matching
their bird of free­
dom to iifiht a previously undefeat
ed cock which was the pride of the
Chinese sporting element.
Upon being placed in the pit,
the eagle went to sleep. The cock
full of pepper, bravely handed his
adversary two blows. This was
too much for the Marine mascot
he awoke from his dream of the
snow-capped Sierras and deliber
ately pulled the chicken's head off.

"The Great Conspiracy of the
House of Morgan Exposed'' and a
practical plan to prevent its con
summation, is a new book just off
the Press, by H.L.Loucks, Water
town South Dakota.
In view of the recent legislation
changing our financial system from
Government money to that of
national bank credits, the con
the confering on a small group
of men the special privilege of a
monopoly, for private profit, of
the constitutional power to issue
and control the money of the na
tion, and to charge such rates of
interest for the use of money or
credit, as will satisfy the demands
of private monopoly the study is
a timely one.
The author handles the subject
in a clcar, concise and convincing
manner giving the official evi
dence upon which he bases his
charge.

.1* is with this thought ii mind thai,
the liter rehearses the following
story.
It was brinlil and earlv on a
riday morning when 'omrade
Samuel M. 1 Iow ird*r ei land ear
pulled out of Gettysburg, with an
editor and Will French. chail'.. for
Onida, to pick up Comrade llenrv
C. Spencer, bound for Kansas City
to attend the fiftieth encampment
of the National G.A.U. On the
suggestion of friends previous to
starting, if was decided to go thru
Arlington. Brookings and Sioux
tails, to get best roads, which
came near being our undoing. In
addition to meeting with inferior
roads, our chaff, got called down
by a blue coated "cop" in the city
of Sioux Falls, when rounding a
street corner, thru a misunder
standing of his lordship's gyra
tions.
From Onida wc went to 1'luut.
thence east along the ''Black and
Yellow Trail" as far as Brooking
where we turned South and went
down the Sioux valley. We were
at Arlington at 7:30 p.m. the far
end of the first day, after
making a run of 210 mile.-,
reached Sionx Falls at one
oclock the seeoud day, arriving at
Jefferson S. D. on the Sioux river.

second
night. Thus far we had two ''blow
outs.'" Corning down the Sioux
valley we must have crossed the
river five times, over its tortuous
course, seeing some line scenery
and a thrifty country, however.
Here we crossed the river again as
we entered Iowa, and were dee
lighted to find a paved road for the
next seven miles miles which look
us into and thru Sioux City.
For the second day's run our
"speedometer"- registered 1 -v,
miles. Only about twenty min
utes were spent in Sioux City, the
third day of our hike, the
time being limited if' we made
Kansas City before the middle of
the encampment, even. Aftei
leaving S.C. our first town was
Sloan, next came Ottawa, then
came Sioux river and Little Sioux
two towns a mile apart, after which
we. decided to stop to see how
what Iowa watermelons and iuu.sk
melons tasted like. As luck had it
we stopt hard by the or
chard of a good Wood
man and his family this was
not discovered, however, till after
we were compelled to adjourn fur
ther proceedings by the right front
wheel of our car '"busting" and
compelling a stop to get repairs.
Unfortunately these were not to be
had short of Council Bluffs, some
fifty miles awuy. ''UncleSammy"'
and our chaff.—(after deciding tile
merits of the case while filling up
on watermelons, muskmelon, ap
ples etc)—were fortunately favor
ed by our host, Neighbor W. M.
Conyer, having some business at
the next R.R. station of Moudamin
Iowa, where they got the train the
same evening. The '"rest of us"
(the writer and Comrade Spencer)
were^most agreeably entertained
by Neighbor Conver's estimable
family, when we were not strolling
thru the orchards or along the ave
nues overhung by walnut, maple,
or cottonwood trees. At this place
the road laid not far from the Old
Muddy, while elsewhere the river
bottoms did not seem to be popul
ated, the highway being laid along
the foot of the bluffs at these
places The corn here was from
ten to thirteen feet in height, a
sample being brought into town
measuring the latter figure.

None of us knew which way to

suggest, to the city dads of Council

put up more guidepusts in their

cant, say what he was doing in the
meantime, while we—the writer
was taking in the city. Wednes
day forenoon was taken up with
watching the preparations for the
"Grand Parade" of the G.A.R..
being the first the writer had ever
witnessed. With packed streets
and dense humanity, this came off
in the forenoon, two hours being
necessary for the marchers to pass
a given point. One of the most
noted features in the parade was
the drum corps from the Sioux
1-alls post, who were dressed in
costume representing the colonial
days of 1776. Our "Comrades" in
the afternoon had business and vis

afternoon) but when we heard a
city-chaff, "ciying for passengers
