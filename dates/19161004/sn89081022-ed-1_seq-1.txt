with the roads, the trip was made in
good time. Olivia, Renville and Sac

present. He expressed his apprecia

FORMAL OPENING
OF OPERA HOOSE
Crowd Attends O
ine Picture at Dreamland
Monday Evening.
Willmar's new opera house was op
ened last Monday evening, with the
showing of the wonderful Vitagraph
picture, "God's Country and the
man." In the neighborhood of eleven
hundred persons were in attendance
at the two performances given that
evening. The building is a beauty,
and one of which the city may well
be proud. The lobby is large, meas
uring 18 by 20 feet, with a tile floor,
and mahogany finished wood work.
It is panelled with plate mirrors on
two sides, and there are plate mir
rors on the double doors at each side
of the ticket booth, which has been
built in the center of the lobby.
The foyer has a depth of eight
feet, and runs clear across the house.
At the right after entering, there is
a lounging room, with easy chairs and
a settee. There are plate mirrors on
each side of the entrance doors. The
foyer rail is finished with velour drap
eries in old rose lavender shades, and
grey Austrian curtains, with lamber
quin effect trimmed with gold braid,
across the entire length. The main
auditorium has a seating capacity of
about 475. The chairs are of Circas
sian walnut, upholstered in Spanish
leather. The woodwork of the audi
torium is also of Circassian walnut
finish. The walls are panelled in a
brocaded effect, in old rose lavender
panels, outlined with gold, and a bor
der, about eighteen inches wide, of
Frepch grey, above the dado. The
dado is done in French grey and rose
shades.
The proscenium arch and beams
across the ceiling are of stucco work,
done by the Curtiss Stucco Manufac
turing Company of Minneapolis. They
are finished in the old ivory tint. The
stucco work is all done in the old Ital
ian Renaissance style. It was design
ed by one of the best designers of this
kind of work, west of New York City.,
and E. Roy Curtiss of Minneapolis
was in charge of the work here. The
front of the balcony has a number of
rosettes finished in old ivory.
Wo-and
For the pictures, the indirect light
ing system is used, and there are six
bowls, made of the stucco, finished in
ivory. The main houBe lights are un
derneath the bowls.
The balcony seats in the neighbor
hood of two hundred persons, giving
the house a capacity of nearly seven
hundred.
The booth is roomy, and is equip
ped with the latest and best for pro
jection in motion pictures. A Powers
6B machine is used, and the alternat
ing current is changed to the direct
by means of a motor generator. The
equipment was purchased thru the
Northwestern Equipment Company of
Minneapolis, and Mr. O. A. Peterson
of that firm was here attending to the
installation of the machines. Mr.
Crosby's office is also in the balcony,
in the northeast corner.
The stage is a little wider than in
the old house, and a few feet less
deep. The scenery was purchased
from the Twin City Scenic Co., and
Mr. .B. Blair of that firm was here
attending to its installation. There
is a rolling asbestos curtain, and the
picture screen Is surrounded by a
novel setting. The dressing rooms
are, as in the old house, under the
stage. There is a large and roomy
orchestra pit, and the music is fur
nished by a ladies' orchestra, consist
ing of the Misses Olive Crosby at the
piano, Ina Brynilsen at the organ
and Lucille Brynilsen, trap drummer.
J. H. Olsen of this city had the con
tract for the building and the interior
decorations, so greatly admired by
everyone, were done by Iver Lind
quist of thiB city. Peter Pearson in
stalled the electrical equipment for
the house. The plumbing was done
by the J. H. Wiggins Co. The build
ing will be heated with steam from
the power house. The draperies were
designed and made by the New Eng
land Furniture Co., of Minneapolis.
The building is as near fireproof
as a modern structure can be made.
The pictures to be shown at Dream
land are taken from the Paramount,
Metro and V. L. S. E. programs. Otto
Kuntz of this city is the machine op
erator.
Musical Friday Evening.
On Friday evening of this week, at

FIRED AT SUNBURG
U. S. Senator Knute
Roasts President Wilson In
Characteristic Stylo.
The Republican State Committee
saw fit to open its state campaign at
Sunburg in Kandiyohi county, four
teen miles from a railway, last Sat
urday, when U. S. Senator Knute Nel
son made the keynote speech. A spec
ial train of Twin City and state cap
ltol politicians came out on the Soo
line to Brooten and made the pilgrim
age by auto from Brooten to add
weight to the occasion. There were
several auto loads from Willmar, tour
of autos from Alexandria, and from
other towns to help swell the crowd of
local people who naturally felt hon
ored by tht visit of the senior senator
to their burg, by reason of which it
has become the best advertised in
land town in the state. The delega
tion on the special train was late in
arriving. The meeting was held in a
show tent which was too small to
room the crowd. There were prelim-
8£NAT0R KNUTE NELSOM.
in?,ry speeches by Mr. Lundeen and
Charley Elmquist. Senator Nelson
read his speech, which appeared in
the daily city press the same after
noon. It required a long time (some
say two hours) for the senator to read
his speech. The event was well stag
ed, but evoked but little enthusiasm
among those who attended from here.
The following is a synopsis of Sen
ator Nelson's speech:
NELSON'S SPEECH.
Owing to dissensions in the ranks
of the Republican party, and to the
fact that It had two candidates in the
field, Woodrow Wilson was, in the
fall of 1912, elected president of the
United States by a minority, though
a plurality, of those who voted at
that election. The fact that he was
chosen by a minority ought to have
made him less partisan and more con
siderate of the welfare of the Ameri
can people. He ought to have been
less eager to Inflict his ultra-Demo
cratic propaganda upon the Ameri
can people, for* he held an elective
mandate only from a minority. He
had no right to assume that a ma
jority of the people were in favor of
him because he was a Democrat, or
that they were in favor of radical,
socialistic, and ultra-economic schemes
of Democratic legislation.
Seeks to Dominate Congress.
No president,, since the days of
Jackson, has so sought to dominate
congress and to subrogate it to his
will and to dictate the legislative
policy of the country as President
Wilson. To accomplish this purpose
and for the sake of notoriety, he
began, at the outset of his adminis
tration, to adopt the custom of deliv
ering in person, orally, his messages
to the*two houses of congress in
joint session. By such an oral mes
sage he inaugurated his tariff legisla
tion, and by such an oral message—
his last—he urged and' induced con
gress to pass the law giving certain
classes of railroad men—the best paid
men in the railroad service—the same
pay for an eight hour day's work
that they were receiving for a ten
hour day's work, or an increase by
legislative flat,' of twenty-five per cent.
Legislation inspired by the presi
dent, and fortified by caucus rule, has,
to a large extent, been the method
that has prevailed under this Demo
cratic administration. And under this
method congress has been in ses
sion two years, seven -months and
fifteen days of the three years and
seven months that have transpired
of President Wilson's term. This
leaves less than a year of his term
up to date that congress has not been
In session.
Tariff Protection Destroyed.
President Wilson was inaugurated
the 4th of March, 1913. Although our
country was then in a most prosper
ous condition, under the Republican
tariff law of 1909, yet his first pur
pose was to uproot and destroy this
lystem of tariff protection and to sub
stitute therefor a*so-called free trade,
or "tariff for revenue only," system.
In pursuance of this policy, he sum
moned congress In extra session and
congress. In obedience to such sum-

Qtick Time Bringsc
Four IndetmNts.
The October term of District Court
is on In full sway at the court house
this week. On the civil calendar a
number of cases have already been
disposed The case of the Stats
Bank of Morton versus Frank EL and
Maggie A. Adams was continued by
consent until next term. The first
road appeal case. Swan Nelson versus
County of'Kandiyohi was setUeoTand
disposed of in accordance with the
written stipulation filed. Judgment Is
to be entered in accordance with the
order filed. In the matter of Ole
Wold versus E. T. Bergquist, in re
gard to wages the plaintiff claimed
were owed him by the defendant, af
ter a good share of the testimony In
the case was heard, it was dismissed
on motion of the plaintiff's attorney,
John I. Davis of Benson. Axel Sol-*
berg, plaintiff was awarded a verdict
of $160 by the jury, in his suit against
C. A. Berg of the town of Kandiyohi.
He was -suing for $250.
As this is written the case of Carl
Christensen versus William Dowdell,
is on triaL The former is suing to
recover what he claims is due him for
some tile work done on the bitter's
farm some time ago. R. H. Dart of
Litchfield is here handling the plain
tiff's case, and R. W. Stanford of this
city appears for the defendant. An
other road appeal case, C. F. Wend
landt versus town board of Roseville
et al, was disposed of in the same
manner as the former road appeal.
On the criminal calendar, the case
of the State of Minnesota versus
James J. Wise and D. R. Morrow was
discontinued, on a motion by the
county attorney, owing to the fact
that there is not enough evidence on
