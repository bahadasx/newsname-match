N,owata, Okla.. Sept. 29.?Two ne
;?>es accused of complicity In the
l tiling: of Deputy Sheriff James Gib*
sun, during a .i. il delivery htro todft/,
were taken from jail here tonight and
lynched In front of the court house.
A fit$t attempt to lynch one of the
Ptgiaei in a church yard immediate?
ly alter their capture was frustrated
if the Rev. Perry K, Pierce, who
pl -adcu wltl^the mob until tho sus
ptnded negro was cut down, uncon
-ous, hut alive. The mob dispersed,
rcfoin.ed later, and made short work
pi both ne|croe8.
Kvents culminating In tho double
lynching moved with dramatic swift?
ness. Three negro prisoners escaped
from the county Jail late today.
Sheriff James May discovered them,
was knocked down and robbed of his
pistol. Gibson went to his aid and
wus shot to death.
In a fsw minutes a mob bent on
vengeance was in close pursuit of tho
no&rocs. Two of them took refuge in
a houpe in the outskirts of Nowat,
Th*y were surrounded and captured.
The third negro apparently escaped.
1 >no of tho captured negroes, John
Foreman, alleged to have killed Gib?
son, was wounded when caught and
was not molested, but the unwounded
negro was seized by the mob, which
had grown to large proportions, and
a parade through the principal
streets began with the negro at a
rope's and, screaming for mercy,
When the mob reached the Methodist
church a lilrge tree offered tho op?
portunity which the rope around the
negro's neck suggested. "Let's lynch
the negro on holy ground," a man
I to have shouted. The pris
was swung clear and was being
his pleadings for the seemingly doom?
ed man's life.
"Men, I beseech you in tho name
of God not to desecrate this holy
ground," pleaded Mr. Pierce. "Do
not stain the name of our city by
going into this terrible affair.''
With great earnestness he demand?
ed that the law be allowed to take it*
course. Five minutes the pastor
spoke, until on a of tho mob lea dors,
turning to hin followers, said: "Men,
I Mr. Pierce Is right Tako the Rtf rtl
I'.ick to Jail and lot the law take it:
cournc." The mob led tho negro back
to Jail, and excitement apparently
Mulcted down.
Tonight Foreman and the negro
into* had been rescued from the mob
in the afternoon wore taken from the
Jail by a larger mob. Foreman w V
strung up to a lump post noar the
court house and the othor ne.^ro wa:
h ingod frdm a tree a few feet dis?
tant. Tho antritt was not at the
apian the mob sought cntr.un o. Tho
deputies left to guard tho ntgrota
were pushed aside and forced into
submission.

Tho efforts of the people of Co?

Fort Worth, Texas, Oct. I.?Henry
X. Pope, president of the Farmers'
Union State Presidents' association,
has submitted to all Southern mem
bers of oongreni the suggnstlon that
com 'ess ft* or empower 'he federal
reserve board to fix a minimum loan
price of 12 cents per pound on coi
ton for all crops. A large majority
Of the replies from senators and rep
resentatives favor the plan and Mr.
Pope stated today that he would call
a special meeting of his association
in New Oilcans at an early date to
giVS it linal consideration and work
out the details.
Many members of congress have
expressed their willingness to give the
movement their cooperation. Among
the numerous communications receiv
ed by President Pope was one from
nator Hardwick of Georgia saying:
'I can not see for a moment Xvhy
this board should not be authorized
to Jix a minimum price on which Dot
ton loans should be accepted. I am
already giving this subject careful con?
sideration and I hope that at an early
'late something effective and reason
able may be worked out along the
line of your suggestion."
Representative T. W. Sims of Ten?
nessee writes: "I am ii hearty* sym?
pathy with this proposition and I shall
bo glad to do all I can to secure tho
legislation needed just as soon as con?
gress convenes in December. You
can rely upon me without any sort
of hesitation to give this or kindred
legislation active and earnest sup?
port."
Representative Otis Wingo of Ar?
kansas states: "I shall be glad to do
.anything 1 can toward amending the
federal reserve act along proper linos
with a view of facilitating credits
greater freedom in the marketing of
his, cotton.
President Pope states that there
should be a careful distinction be?
tween the loan minimum and the sell?
ing minimum of cotton. "The loan
minimum should be protected by tho
government*" he said, "and cotton
would of course never be sold below
that point. The selling minimum is
one that the union advises its members
to sell atid may vary from crop to
erop or from time to time. With a
I
protected loan minimum of 12 centi
the selling minimum of 20 cents can.
be more easily maintained. The gov
I eminent would never be called upon
to put up one cent tinder this plan for
when a. farmer knows he can borrow
12 cents per pound on cotton l.o will
never sell unless he ean get a much
Iii her price. Neither could the con
sun..; be penalized, for the Uuctu
ation In tho price oi cot ion has lit?
tle effect upon the price of the tinished
product to the consumer. We expect
to mature our pb.ns at our meeting
a NOW Orleans and it is likely we will
seek the counsel and approval of the
federal reserve board before prescnt
I our plans to congress."
