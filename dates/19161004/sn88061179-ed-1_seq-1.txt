No. 39
Crack Militia
Companies
Gave Beautiful Exhibition on
Parade at Brownsville.
(Brownsville Sentinel;)
The most beautiful military
display Of infantry ever wit?
nessed in this section of the
liordor was cheered to the echo
by thousauds of civilians and
Boldiers at the post hue yester?
day when the crack companies
chosen from the live militia
regiments stationed here pass
in review before General Par
Ite'rj District Commander, ami
Colonel Hatch, Commander of
tin? Kirst Provisional Brigade,
the Kirst Iowa band had been
awarded tho honor of playing
for the event, and did its part
to make the review a notable
occasion.
The review was non-cohpoti
tivo, so there is no decision as
to which ono of the tivc was
the best drilled and best turned
out company. No person save,
perhaps, an army officer would
have the hardihood to essay a
decision , as the companies mo v
ed as one great machine as or?
der after order was given! Nei?
ther can there be ah easy choice
hh to which was the best look?
ing company as every man in
tho ensemble turned out in new
uniform from crown to sole,
shoes neatly shined and arms
gleaming in the late afternoon
sun.
No smarter troops have ever
been seen horo, and the crowds
broke into applause as each
company filed thru the gate
and into the post. It was noted
also that tho men in the com?
panies applauded other com?
panies ns they marched past
and came to rest.
The real beauty of the dis?
play became apparent when the
live companies marched into
the parade grounds and formed
in review, every man inarching
proudly, eyes to the front and
rille held at just the correel
angle. Tho first roar of ap?
plause came came when the
manual of arms was given,with
five hundred rifles Hashing in
unison ami crashing butts to
the ground as one.
Equally beautiful and inspir?
ing wus tho perfect alignment
preserved as each company
swung past the reviewing of?
ficers to tremendous volumes of
applause Personality and in?
dividuality was lost, each com?
pany appearing as some giant
cattorpillar moving abreast.
The people who had marvell?
ed at the regimental dress
parados were not prepared to
beliovo that oven the picked
companies could give such an
exhibition as that of yesterday.
Ii is a tribute to each of the five
coinpunies that "popular de?
cisions" wore totally lacking
during and after tho review;
neither did any one company
draw any preponderance of ap?
plause from the admiring thou
sanda: this if wo may except
the rebel yell that split the uir
as one of tho Virginia com
paules passed by.
Colonel Hatch, Brigade com?
mander, was gratoly ploased
w'ith tho performance of his
aiou. He is equally gratified at
tho large crowds that have been
turning out to witness the var?
ious reviews tho past few days,
as ho very naturally takes a
professional pride in the accom
pliahments of his men, Colonel
Hatch also believes that civilian
intorest in military affairs will
serve an excellent purpose in
quickening thought on the pre
pared ness question in u general
way.

acquitted themselves so credit

Mr. Slemp's Vote On Trade
Commission Bill.
There has been much discus
sion hero of the article in Pri
day's Bristol Herald Courier
about Congressman Slemp's
vote on tho Trade Commission
measure. Mr. Trinklo asserted
in his speeches that Mr. S.lenip
voted against the bill, anil the
Herald Courier quotes a Demo
cratic statistician in support of
Ihe assertion. In Mr. Slemp's
speech at Abingdnn he slated
that he did vote for the Trade
Commission act.
Tho statistician's letter says
that he voted against the bill
oh Juno 1014. The Demo?
cratic campaign text hook,page
224, shows briefly that the
measure was finally passed
early in August, 1914, and
makes no reference to tin; early
vote in the House, cited by the
statistician.
Tho Trade Commission bill
was purly an administrative
measure, for the purpose of
readjusting the Bureau of Cor?
porations,us found desirable af?
ter the division of the original
Department of Commerce and
Labor into two separate Depart
moots. The bill originally pres?
ented to Um Hons; was not
satisfactory to a great many
members, ami some voted
against it to voice their disnp
proval, others just let it go, or
didn't voto at all. Practically
an entirely new bill was then
drafted by the Senate, and
when tho latter was brought be?
fore the House from Conference
it was accepted by all members,
Congressman Sleirtp among
tho number. It seems that he
considered only tho Trade Com?
mission measure as it now
stauds enacted into law, and
not preliminary phases of the
bill before it was adjusted into
more satisfactory shape from
hu; viewpoint.
