NEW YORK. Oct 3. The Bos
ton American league club and the
Brooklyn Nationals will meet in
the 1916 world's series, the open
ing game of which will be played
on Braves Field at Boston next
Saturday, October 7.
The teams will remain in Bos

on Monday, October 9, after which
they will return to Brooklyn for
two games at Ebbets Field on
Tuesday and Wednesday, October
10 and 11. The fifth and sixth
games, If necessary, will be play
ed on Thursday. October 12, and
Friday .October 13, at Boston and
Brooklyn.
Should a seventh game be.nec
essary the location of the contest
will be decided by the tossing of
a coin.
Brooklyn Victory Surprise
All of these details were ar
ranged by the National Baseball
Commission this afternoon.- The
winner of the National pennant
was not known at that time, and
the same dates that applied to
Brooklyn also applied to the Phil
adelphia's before nightfall, how
ever, the victory of Brooklyn over
New York and the double defeat
administered to the Philadelphia
Nationals by Boston clinched the
pennant for the Brooklyn players.
Originally it was intended, to hold
the national commission conference
here today but later it was decided to
defer It until tomorrow. President
John K. Tener of the National league
and Chairman Garry Hermann of the
commission, arrived in this city last
night, but President B. B. Johnson of
the American league was not expect
ed until tomorrow.
When Johnson appeared early this
morning there was a hurried consul
tation at which it was decided to hold
the meeting as originally scheduled.
Presidents C. H. Ebbets of the Brook
lyn club, W. F. Baker of the Philadel
phia club of the ! National league,
whose teams were still fighting for
the pennant, and President J. J. Lan
nin of the Boston Americans, were
hurriedly summoned and the commis
sion went into session shortly before
noon.
Opens On Braves' Field
President Lannin suggested that
t RPrips he nnened at the nark of .
the Boston Nationals, where the Am-1
ericans will stake all their home
games owing to its immense seating
capacity, instead of deciding the place
of the initial games by the customary
toss of a coin. This plan was adopted
in view of the fact that both the
Brooklyn and Philadelphia clubs
would require several days in which
to install additional seats and boxes
to accommodate the large crowds.
President Baker proposed that this
series begin Monday, October 9, but
this was vetoed b ythe commission as
being an unnecessary delay as was
the suggestion that the play start on
Friday. October 6, on the grounds that
the National league winner required
a day or two of rest before being
flung into the world's series against
the Boston team, who clinched their
league pennant two days ago.

Seconds After It Is Made On Diamond
The major league season came to a sudden and dramatic close yesterday
and with its closing, rose the names of two master teams in the baseball
firmament, one of them destined to be hailed in a few short days as the
greatest baseball aggregation the world has ever seen.
Several days have passed now since the Boston Red Sox were conceded
to be the American league champions, but it remained for yesterday to seal
the fortunes of the Brooklyn Nationals over the Philadelphia Phillies, their
chief runners-up. j
This was done when the Brooklyns nosed out a victory from New York,
while the Phillies dropped two to the Boston Braves, leaving two and a half'

Mining Must Resume
The American members of the com

mining men's representatives. After
their conference the American com
missioners issued a statement which
said that if satisfactory arrangements
can be reached with reference to the
n.atters, especially the resumption of
mining activities, improved condi
tions in Mexico can be definitely ex
pected. Such resumption would be distinct
ly beneficial to furnishing employ
ment to Mexican labor, it was said
and also would be a source of imme
diate revenue to the Mexican govern
ment. The necessary prerequisite to
such a plan would be the return to
Mexico of American mining operators
who have withdrawn during the recent
crisis between the two governments,

tory assurances are given as to the
safety of the lives and property of
the operators, no resumption can be
