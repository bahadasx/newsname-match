There has been installed in our
Public schools several JohnsManville
Fire Extinguishers One of these

roads in the county. He expresses
himself as much pleased with the
progress made by Cook county in the
matter of road building, comment­
ing especially on^the new roads and
the excellent maintenance of all the
roads.
The action of the Duluth Automo­
bile club and the County Board of
Lake County in expressing their in­
terest in Cook county roads and
bridges which is evidenced by their
aid on the Pigeon River bridge is
gratifying to those interested in the
development of Cook county. North­
eastern Minnesota will become popu­
larized to the tourists of America
when Duluth and St. Louis county
realize that in the natural beauties
of Lake and Cook county they have
an invaluable asset in the boosting
of Duluth to the tourist trade, of
the north shore. It is regrettable
that the part of the North Shore
Highway which lies in St. Louis
county is not the best part of that
road, which it should be when we
consider the wealth of the counties
through which it passes, but it is
hoped that before another season
passes we will see that road in the
condition it should be to conform to
the roads of Lake and Cook counties.

COUNTY FAIR PROVED
A RGEAT SUCCESS
Much Interest Shown In The Second
Annual Fair of Cook County
Agricultural Society
The fair of the Cook County Ag­
ricultural Society which was held on
Thursday, Friday and Saturday of
last week was a grand success, the
exhibits in all departments showing
that Cook county is productive and
that the products raised here are
equal to those raised anywhere.
The vegetable and fruit depart­
ment was a fine display and credit
to the county. In the fruits, the
apples shown were a surprise to
most of the patrons of the fair.
There were about forty exhibits of
apples, all of them raised on trees
that were set out a few years ago
by individuals who put them out sim­
ply as an experiment, sceptical as to
the wisdom of putting out fruit
trees in Cook county.
The forage crops for which this
county is especially adapted, were
well represented. In the grain de­
partment there were not so many en­
tries, as less attention has been
paid to the raising of grains than
other products. There were a large
number of cattle shown, most of
which were of the Holstien breed.
The poultry division had a large
number of exhibits and much inter­
est was shown in this department.
Altogether the fair was a com­
plete Success, the attendance being
good every day, the exhibits show­
ing that Cook county is a farming
county and there is not much that
cannot be grown here.
Messrs. A. B. Hostetter, H. G. Lar­
son, M. J. Thompson and Gilbert
Martin, of Duluth, who are connect­
ed with the Extension Division of
the State Agricultural school were
here to assist the management as
judges of the different departments.
Mr. M. J. Thompson and H. G. par­
son acted as judges of the live stock
and after judging each class, Mr.
Thompson gave a talk on the good
and bad points of the animals exhi­
bited. On Friday wight a talk was
given by each of these gftntlemen
the subjects in scientific farming1in
which they have specialized which
proved interesting and instructive to
the large audience which was on
hand to hear them.

ners in the Needlework, Culinary and

will be published inour next issue.

THE COOK NEWS-HERALD.
GRAND MARAIS, COOK COUNTY, MINN*, OCTOBER 4, 1916.
WILL OPEN MILL ON
RICE'S POINT DEC. 1st.
Lumber Company Closes West Du
's luth Plant for the Season.
May Move Here.
Before establishing a sawmill at
Ciasccade Lake or at Grand Marais,
the Alger Smith Lumber Company
Wjll open their sawmill at Rice's
Point, in Duluth, about Dec. 1, and
run day and night shifts, according
t£ John W. Bayly, secretary of the
Duluth and Northern Minnesota rail­
way company, yesterday. The mill
in West Duluth was closed this week
for the season.
"No decision has been made as to
where the mill is to be located," said
Secretary Bayly. "It was the com­
pany's original plans to erect a mill
with a capacity of 1,500,000 feet of
lumber daily, at Cascade Lake. This
lake, situated about 18 miles from
Lake Superior, has excellent facili­
ties. We are also considering a pro­
posed site in Grand Marais. Nothing
definite has been decided as to either
place.
"The plant will employ about 150
men to a shift. There are about
500,000,000 feet of standing timber
in Cook county, some of which is
owned by our company. This would
be sufficient to supply the new mill
for 10 years. We would rail our
lumber to Knife River, where it will
be loaded on boats for lower lake
ports.
The Rice's Point mill will probably
be 'moved to the site selected at
Gr^nd Marais or Cascade lake next
summer. It will be run to its full
capacity this winter here," said Sec­
retary Bayly.
The Rice's Point mill has been run
ing in Duluth for more than a quar­
ter of a century and if moved, the
company will seek to induce many of
the old employes to move to the new
mill site.—Duluth Herald.
If Grand Marais should be chosen
as the site for the sawmill, the Al­
ger Smith Company will find that
the citizens of this vilage as well as
those of Cook county will welcome
the- industry and co-operate with the*
it3 any in every way possible, as
it will mean a great deal to the vil­
age nd county.
NEW BANK TO OPEN FOR
BUSINESS NEXT WEEK
Grand Marais State Bank Will Open
Temporary Quarters In The
Trding Post Building
The Grand Marais State Bank will
open for business next Monday morn­
ing, quarters having been secured
which will be occupied until the com­
pletion of the building which they
now have under construction. They
will occupy the quarters formerly
used by the Ogima Mercantile Com­
pany.
The officers of the new bank are
H. B. Postlewaite, of Duluth, Presi­
dent J. A. Kirkwood, Jr, Vice Presi­
dent and A. M. Anderson, Cashier.
Mr. Postlewaite who is Vice Presi­
dent of the East End State Bank of
Duluth, and who was also for some
time with the Banking Department
of the State of Minnesota as Bank
Examiner, has also been elected a di­
rector.
The bank is capitalized at $15,000.
00, with surplus of $3'000.00. The
following are directors: H. B. Post­
lewaite, J. A. Kirkwood, Jr., A. M.
Anderson, P. E. Aim, J. G. Scott,
Wm. Clinch and L. H. Lien.

sen were visitors in the village on

Miss Olga Christianson, of Hov­
land was a visitor in the village dur­

The showing of apples
County Fair last week was a sur­
prise to everyone, including the
manager of the exhibit. A former
citizen of one of the best fruit-rais­
ing sections of Michigan, now resid­
ing in Cook county, is authority for
the statement that the first exhibit
of apples in that county was not
half as good as the showing made
last week for Cook county. On the
South Shore, a man was daring en­
ough a few years ago to plant forty
acres in applee trees and his sanity
was questioned. He is reaping the
profits this year and those who ques­
tioned his judgment at that time
have changed their views and there
are many orchards there in the mak­
ing now. We would like to see
more apple trees planted, also more
strawberry plants put out, and we
have no doubt that there will be
more attention paid to these things
in the future.
Survey For Gunflint Road Completed
County Surveyor Axel Berglund
and his assistants returned on Mon­
day night from the northern part of
the county, having completed the
survey of the new Gunflint road to
the vicinty of the nineteen mile post
of the old road. The new route is a
big improvement over the old road
as there are no grades on it to com­
pare with the numerous hills on the
old road. The road leaves Maple
Hill settlement near the Wm. Ell
quist farm and continues northerly
quite a distance east of the old road,
the climb over Pine Mountain being
entirely eliminated. The conditions
for road making on the new route
are very good. The road will be
another popular route fqr tourists
as it penetrates a territory rich in
the beauties of nature.
Fishermen to Convene October 7th.
A call has been issued to the fish­
ermen of the county for a meeting
to be held at the court house on
next Saturday night for the purpose
of discussing the ways and menas
of improving the fishing industry,
the marketing of fish being thp sub­
ject which will be especially consid­
ered. It is hoped that every fisher­
man in the county will attend the
meeting as the success of such a con­
vention depends upon united action
upon the part of those effected.
Boy Scouts to Organize
Supt. M. R. Beebe is planning to
organize a troop of Boy Scouts in
this village. The purpose of such
an organization is to develop the
boys physically .and mentally, to
make them better citizens at their
maturity. Scoutcraft includes in­
struction in First Aid, Life Saving,
Tracking, Signalling, Cysling, Na­
ture Study, Seamanship, Campcraft,
Woodcraft, Chivalry and all the
handicrafts. No expensive equip­
ment is required. All that is needed
is the out-of-doors, a group of boys
and a competent leader.
The organization is a world-wide
one, and should be encouraged in
this community. Our boys are good
boys, but such an organization would
do much for making them better,
both for the present and the fu­
ture.

His Recommendation
A young man found it difficult to meet the
request for a recommendation when he sought
anew position in a strange city.
Finally he thought of his bank book and at
the next interview produced the same as a re­
commendation of his thrift and industry.
The novelty of the idea linked with the
continuity of deposits shown by the book, se­
cured the position for him without further in­
quiry.
Have you a recommendation of this kind
to back you, should you lose your present po­
sition? If not, get a pass book today and de­
posit your money with

fund would be used, according to tf
plan, to reclaim waste lands which
might be sold to prospective tillers.
The money received for the lands
would be used again for the reclam­
ation of other lands.'
The establishment 'of the law
which the state association favors
depends upon the approval at the
coming election of Amendment No. 1
to the state constitution. Among
other movements favored by the as­
sociation for improving and develop­
ing the state's resources are:
Lending school funds on improved
agricultural' lands.
The establishment of a state-su
pervised bank to lend money on the
security of farm loans which are to
be paid by the amortization plan.
State aid to road building.
Improvements to drainage by state
aid.
The association at its meeting in
St. Paul last July also recommended
the establishment of two-year col­
lege courses in selected high schools.
The All Minnesota Development
Association was organized last year
at the suggestion of the late Gov­
ernor W. S. Hammond. F. W. Mur­
phy of Wheaton is president and
Charles T. Kelley of Menahga is sec­
retary.
Catholic Church Dedicated Thursday
On Wednesday evenig Bishop Mc
Golrick and Father Raymond, of Du­
luth, and Father Lemire, of Cloquet,
arrived on the steamer America and
on Thursday morning the Catholic
church was dedicated. Mrs. Coutire
and Mrs. Thompson of Cloquet, also
came and rendered special music for
the occasion. A class of fifty-two
was confirmed in the local church
and the Chippewa city church. Fa­
ther Simon who has been in charge
of the Catholic church here was also
in attendance.
J. B. McCULLOUGH
Non-Partisan Candidate For Repre­
sentative, 57th District.
Mr. J. B. Mc Cullough, of Knife
River, Non-Partisan candidate for
Representative of the 57th Legisla­
tive District made this office a plea­
sant call on Friday morning. Mr.

17 years, been employed as engineer
by the Duluth and Northern Minne­
sota R. R. and resides at Knife Ri­
ver. While he was not known to us

didacy, he impresses us as a good,
clean, honest and capable man for
