Topcka's growing importance as
railroad and agricultural center is
nc.tin about to be demonstrated. A
movement is now under way by the
Santa Fe railroad to bring the head
quarters of "The Earth.", an agricul
tural and industrial magazine, pub
lisried in the interest of the Santa Fe.
to Topeka. Consideration of the plan
has been under way in the Chicago
offices of the Santa Fe for several
weeks.
Under the new plan the inagazina
will be moved here and affiliated with
the Santa Fe industrial and agricul
tural department, a new office, there
by throwing all tne Santa Fe agricul
tural and development offices together
in this city.
The Earth" is a monthly publica

ricultural and industrial interests of
the southwest Altho published un

many years he was the Topeka cor

Moving the offices of the publica

mean the magazine would be written
and printed ir. Topeka and this city
would be the certer of all operations
in connection with its issuance.
The October issue of the publication
contained sixteen pages, 10x14 inches.
Considerable space is always devoted
to Topeka and Kansas.
Jn Chicago it is now published from
the Kailway Exchange building. "Dry
Farming," stock raising, reclamation,
poultry raising, wheat and corn grow

the magazine here will go thru, are
strong, it has been said in reports re

Christian Science Healing Up
held by '. Y. Court.
o Crime to Treat by Prayer,
Says Judge.
Albany, X. Y-. Oct. 4. Christian
Science healing is legal in New York
.state. This is the substance ot" a de
ci.sion handed down by the court of
appeals which paves the way for leg
islation which has been presented to
the legislature for a number of years,
and which would write into the stat
utes of the state permission for Chris
tian Science healers to practice with
out conflict with the public health and
penal laws.
The case was that of William Ver
non Cole of New York, who was con
victed in 1912 of illegally practicing
medicine and fined $ 100. The case
was made a test and was fought bit
terly through the various courts until
the decision of the highest state trib
unal spelled victory for the Christian
Scientists.
The court reversed the judgment,
and ordered a new trial, all of the
judges concurring. Chief Judge Wil
Jard Bartlett went" even further than
his conferees on the bench and in a
memorandum accompanying the gen
eral opinion, he says:
I would go farther. I deny the
power of the legislature to make it a
crime to treat disease by prayer."

AMBITIOUS TO NA8 CHINA
Predict Japanese Army on Way

He Leaves Post as Governor
General of Korea.
Tokio, Oct. 4. Marshal Terauchi
has been appointed prime minister,
succeeding Count Okuma, who re
signed yesterday.
Count Marshal Terauchi, the new
Japanese premier, holds the highest
rank in the Japanese army and until
his appointment to the premiership to
day was governor-general of Korea.
Terauchi, a fighting man, strongly
supported by Japanese leaders favor
ing a strong military policy, is under
stood to have been the candidate of
the upper house of the Japanese par
liament. He has been described by
writers as the champion of an aggressive-
expansionist policy, particularly
with reference to China.
One Japanese newspaper declared
recently that if Terauchi ever succeed
ed Okuma as prime minister it would
not be long before a Japanese army
was on the road to Pekin.
Conservative on Foreign Affairs.
Washington, Oct. 4. The appoint
ment of Count Marshal Terauchi,
premier of Japan is an effort of the
emperor to pick a man who will win
the support of the politcal factions of
Japan and put an end to the bitter
party strife of the past few years, ac
cording to Japanese officials here to
day. Terauchi, being a military man,
it was said, belongs to no party mnd
therefore is in a good position to win
support of all factions. It is expected
that he will name a coalition cabinet.
The efforts being made to harmo
nize the political groups in Japan, is
said to be for the purpose of getting
the country solidly behind the govern
ment on the three big questions of the
day Japan's relations with the Unit
ed States, her relations with China and
the question of taxation for the main
tenance of her army and navy.
Speaking of his future stand on the
Japanese immigration and land ques
tion with the t'nited States, they said,
; however, that Terauchi had a reputa
tion in Japan for extreme caution re
garding international questions and
that they were sure he would do noth
ing to harm the friendly relations be
tween Japan and the United States.
Terauchi was formerly minister of
war.

'HAM AND 30 CENTS
Restaurant Prices Advance of 5 Cents
Hits Thousands.
New York, Oct. 4. The rising of
food prices waa impressed upon thou
sands of citizens today by the action
of the largest dairy restaurant here
in advancing prices. This corporation
which owns a chain of lunch rooms in
Xew York and other cities added 5
cents to the prices of all the staple
dishes. Bacon and eggs and ham and
eggs now cost 30 cents instead of 25
cents. A small steak is 30 cents in
stead of 25 cents; plain omelette has
jumped from 15 to 20 cents. Kven
corned beef has advanced from 15

order higher, no matter how prepared.
All pies from now on are 10 cents a
cut.
The wholesale price of sugar ad
vanced from 6 cents to 7 cents a
pound today and the retail price from
7 to 8 cents. The increased demand
resulting from the war was given as
the reason.

Also at IiO?e Feast,
Xew York, Oct. 4. Strains from the
ex-presidents' "Harmony Duet" still
cloyed the atmosphere around Repub
lican headquarters today. William H.
Taft and Theodore Roosevelt had met
shaken hands and spoken.
Two years ago they met at a fu
neral. Last night it was a sort of
christening bee. The christenee was
"Harmony." The Union League club
was the christening spot. No mere
reporters were permitted to desecrate
the scene but .
Roosevelt and Taft did shake hands.
They both asked "How do you do,"
but neither answered the question.
There was not anyone who heard any
"Dear Will" or "Dear Theodore" stuff.
The two merely nodded, Taft stuck
his hand out. Roosevelt grabbed it,
gave it one up and down pump and
dropped it. Then the two with
Chauncey, M. Depew standing between
them, stood in line while all the big
Republicans in New York City passed
along behind open-faced suits and
witn nands outstretched that itched to
be shaken by two former presidents
iiiu a wouia-De president he was
Charles Hughes on the same night.
Reporters Outside Looking In.
That much is agreed today bv every
one who was inside while the reporters
were kept outside, looking in.
As to just who got the colonel and
juage lart together, there is differ
ence of opinion. Taft arrived before
Roosevelt and had taken his place in
line when Roosevelt, shaking hands
.ism auu iert, appeared. Some say
Governor Whitman hooked his arm
thru the colonel's, led him over to
Jiui ana saiu:
"Mr. Taft, here's Colonel Roose
velt.
Some say George R. Sheldon did the
deed. At any rate that's all them was
to it insofar as Taft and Roosevelt
were concerned. Some said they were
cordial. Others said neither smiled.
This later was refuted by still others
who said it would have been physical
ly iiiipossioie ior euner to xeep fron
grinning. But there were nthor :t
tie high spots that made it almost as
interesting as if the colonel and Taft
nad hugged each other. For
stance, when Roosevelt got in the ele
vator, who should have been crowd
ed against him but W.'. Murray Crane,
who is said to have accumulated as
many unsaid words as he has dollars.
The Colonel Meets Root.
The two spoke but Roosevelt
alone spoke above a whisper. When
he said "Howde-do," Crane leaned
carefully over to the colonel's ear
some say it was the colonel's right
ear; others the left and moved his
lips. Roosevelt, according to eye
witnesses, pretended to hear Crane
and in turn leaned to Crane's ear. His
lips moved. Crane smiled, nodded his
head and once more whispered in
Roosevelt's ear. Roosevelt smiled.
That was all of that.
Then Roosevelt ran against Klihu
Root, who guided Taft's "tank" at
Chicago in 1912. Both smiled broadly
and shook hands. This act brought
much buzz-buzz of approval ;nd some
handclapping. There isn't any more
of that.
But the incident no one forgot to
mention when the news-hungry re
porters were being tossed the official
scraps of information was the meet
ing between well, you d never guess
- between Boise Penrose and Roose
velt. Penrose ponderously paraded
to the receiving line and got a real
smile, so everyone insisted.
William Barnes was a late arrival.
He said the crowd was so thick he
was unable to get close enough to the
colonel to speak.
- Marshall Dubious on Love Keast.
Chicago, Oct. 4. Vice President
Marshall is still skeptical about the
handshaking between Colonel Roose
velt and ex-President Taft last night.
"You cannot change a man's heart
by touching his hand," he said here to
day. "The whole thing is just a bit
of pyrotechnics, that's all."
CONFERENCE nTT SNAG
Joint Commission Debating With
drawal of Pershing's Army.
Atlantic City, Oct. 4. Further con
sideration by the Mexican-American
joint commission was given today to
the plan of border control proposed
by the Mexican members. It was re
garded as probable that Gen. Tasker
H. Bliss, assistant chief of staff of the
United States army, would appear be
fore the American commission in an
advisory capacity.
That the- plan which involves 'the
withdrawal of General Pershing's
forces would be adopted prior to a
definite understanding regarding Gen
eral Carranza's attitude respecting the
reopening of mines and other indus
tries was regarded as improbable.

Laredo, Tex., Oct. 4. Mexico City is

They also assert that the health
authorities in the capital are making
little attempt to curb the spread of
the diseases and the death rate from
typhus is exceedingly heavy.

HELD FOR KILLING
Xegro and White Face Trial for '
Manslaughter.
Charged With Death of Pris
oner in City Jail.
TALE OF TROUBLE BEHIND BARS
Prisoners Fought at Will
Bennett Was Killed.
Inhuman Treatment of Men
Held for Safe Keeping.
Clifford Frost, negro, and Hie hard
Campbell, white, will be tried on' the
charge of being responsible for the
death of Ed Bennett, which occurred
in the city jail last Saturday night.
The coroner's jury today found that
Bennett died because of the concus
sion of his head on the cement floor
of the jail after he had been struck by
the two fellow prisoners. Warrants
will be issued by the county attorney
charging the two men with man
slaughter. After spending parts of two days on
the case the coroner's jury brought in
the following verdict today:
"Edward Bennett came to his death
by his head striking the floor of the
city jail after having. been struck on
the head by one Richard Campbell
and one Clifford Frost and the jury
do recommend that both of them be
held for trial."
Immediately following Bennett's
death it was announced that it was
due to a fall from a table in the city
jail while in an intoxicated condition.
All of the evidence introduced at the
hearing Tuesday and today was to the
effect that he did fall from the table
and strike his head tn the floor. But
there was witness after witness who
testified that Bennett appeared to
have suffered no injury from that fall.
The testimony disclosed tactics fol
lowed by prisoners in the city jail. It
described the "kangaroo court." Be
fore Bennett was arrested for
drunkenness and confined in the jail,
several other prisoners had formed a
pact to stand together in case any
bbelligerent prisoner was turned in.
That pact, it developed later, was re
sponsible for Bennett's death.
Jennings Teased Him.
The testimony showed that when
Bennett was placed in the jail Satur
day night, he was intoxicated, and
that he lay down on a table. He
rolled off of that but arose and began
walking around the "bull pen." How
ard Jennings, a negro, testified that
he teased the intoxicated man by fill
ing a shovel with coals and threaten
ing to burn him with them. Bennett
became angry and attempted to fight
Jennings The latter kept him off
with the shovel.
There had been several fights in the
jail that evening before Bennett was
taken in. Richard Campbell testified
that while Bennett was following up
Jennings he, Campbell, stepped up be
hind Bennett and struck him twice,
once on the side of the head and again
on the back. All the testimony went
to show that Bennett did not fall at
that time, altho be leaned forward.
First Struck Him.
Four or five witnesses, including
Clifford Frost, testified that at the
moment Bennett leaned forward
Frost dropped off the top of a cage
and struck Bennett a terrific blow on
the chin. Bennett went to the floor
with a thud and did not rise. He was
placed in a bunk by the prisoners and
left alone. Later in the night they
noted his rapid breathing and called
the attention of Ed Woodruff, night
jailer, to it. He called Dr. H. L. Clark,
city physician. Doctor Clark made an
examination and called Dr. Merrill
Lindsay. Before the latter arrived
Bennett was dead. Doctor Clark ex
pressed the opinion today that Bennett
was knocked unconscious by the blow
delivered by Frost, but that it was the
striking of his head on the floor that
fractured his ekull.
One of the prisoners testified that
after Frost struck Bennett, the for
mer turn to Campbell and said:
There, I put one to eleep, Jennings
has already put one out of business
and now it's your turn.,

Wealthy Tea Merchant Tells
How He Was Fleeced.
"BUDA GODMAN" CAUGHT HIM
He Was Arrested With Her by
Phoney Federal Officers.
Was Released After He Paid
$15,000 to "Commissioner."
New York, Oct. 4. The first move
to exterminate the band of interna
tional blackmailers who have been
operating under the Mann, "white
slave" act, was put into operation
when the October grand jury was
sworn in at the Federal building.
Immediately after Edward R. W,est,
wealthy tea and coffee merchant, who
was fleeced out of $15,000 by the gang
of blackmailers, was taken before the
grand jury.
Judge Sheppard, in swearing in the
grand jurors, made mention of the
operations of the gang. He told them
that the gang made use of the Mann
act to help them in their work. The
law, he said, was of value to the stat-
Svethrbiackmaiws " wa3 employed
Many hundreds of thousands of dol
lars. Judge Sheppard told the jury,
had been taken from men and women
thruout the country by the blackmail
ers, and he urged them to give their
utmost attention to the cases involv
ing the Mann act brought before
them.
AVest Tells Story.
West is vice president of the C. D.
Gregg Tea & Coffee company of this
city. He arrived 'here from Chicago,
where he had been taken by the black
mailers, posing as federal officers, and
forced to give up $15,000 for his free
dom. According to West, he was induced
to come to New York by a woman
now known as Buda Godman early in
May. At that time he knew her as
Alice Williams. He went with her to
the Hotel Ansonia, using the name
Wesley.
Early on the morning of May 7.
three men broke into the room and
made the pair prisoners, as violators
of the Mann act. West was taken "in
custody" and hurried to Chicago, he
says, by the three fictitious federal
officers who made the "arrest." There
he was taken before a "United States
commissioner" and released after he
had paid $15,000.
Important Witness.
When part of the gang of black
mailers was run down in Chicago two
weeks ago Sunday night. West came
forward and identified three of the
men as the "federal officers" who had
"arrested" him. He also identified
Buda Godman as his companion.
West is tall and dark haired and
handsome looking. When he went
before the grand jury he was closely
guarded by federal officers who would
allow no one to approach him. This
vigil will be kept over the wealthy
merchant until indictments hav been
handed down and the men and women
orougnt to trial. -
Capt. William Offley, head of the
department of justice operatives, also
appeared as a witness. William But
ler, who is now in the Tombs under
an eighteen months' sentence for his
connection with the blackmailing
gang, refused to appear before the
grand jury as a witness.

Distributors Refuse to Deal
With Producers' League.
Mayor Mitchel Tries in Vain for
a Settlement.
New York, Oct. 4 While the pangs
of milk hunger began to hurt on the
east side today Mayor Mitchel as med
iary tried to stop the up-state milk
strike. Ho had a proposal from the
Dairymen's league the producers
to deal with the Big Three distrib
utors without league recognition, but
with the demanded Increases in prices
under a six months' contract.
From statements of distributors
however, it seemed there must be re
jection or modification of this plan
if the strike is, to end.
They have contended that they can
not deal with the league that they
must do business as in the past with
the farmers themselves. The string
tied to the farmers' proposals, how
ever, appeared also to be a stumbling
block. Meantime tne miiK supply
dwindled rapidly, tho some additional
came in from new and distant sources.
No Milk for Baby Bcbeoca.
Over on the East Side where In
creased prices or shortage first are
felt, it was a common scene today to
see little children with pails grasped
tight in emaciated hands begging at
delicatessen stores and milk depots
for just a little milk so that baby
Abie or Rebecca wouldn't suffer. But
for the most part their appeals fell
on deaf ears for the dealers had noth
ing to give.
Farther up town in the quick
lunches, they, too were short of milk.
"Say boss, has the milkman been
around yets" yelled tho man behind
the counter in one of these.
"Naw," replied the boss, disgust
edly, "and you'll be lucky if you see
him for several days."
That was the situation all over
town. The distributors still looked af
ter hospitals and families with chil
dren but the portion at each home
was either serioutly diminished or en
tirely eliminated.
Adopt "Night Rider' Tactics.
"Night rider" bands of enraged
farmers are busy up-state attacking
dairies and milk wagons and dumping
out milk of other producers who have
refused to join the league.

' New York, Oct. 4. A conference to
day between Mayor Mitchel and rep

distributing companies in an effort to
bring about a settlement of the differ

Dairymen's league over the price of
milk failed of result according to of
