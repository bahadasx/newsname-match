JOE S. CRESWELL
WAS SLAIN BY HIS
17-YEAR-OLD SON
Tragedy Followed Dispute
About Bale of
Cotton.
Horace Use* Shotgun and Fires in
Father's Face After Heated Dispute
in Which Father is Said to
Hare Ahused Wife.
J. S. Cresswell, better known as
Joe Pitt Cresswell, was shot and
killed by his 17-year-old son Horace,
at his home about three miles west
of Troy Thursday afternoon. Details
of the tragedy have been hard to get,
but the story of the killing, as reported
here, is to the effect that Horace
and his brothers were preparing
to leave home with a bale of cotton
for the market, when a dispute arose
as to whether it should be hauled to
McCormick or Troy. The father,
the reports state, wanted the bale
- . sold at one place and the boy andi
his mother at another. This led to
a heated discussion when the elder
Cresswell is said to have abused his
wife. The sen interceded in behalf
of his mother, and the shooting folJ?wed.
The weapon used was a shot?an.
Cresswell was shot in the fqee
and died instantly.
Mr. CressvdR was about 55 years
of age and had Jived in the Troy section
all his life. He farmed and conducted
a blacksmith shop near his
home. His wife was Miss Fannie
Tolbert
The killing occurred in a portion
of Abbeville county cut off into McCormick.

Mr. Cresswell was buged at Buffalo
Baptist church Friday ntoniing at
II o'clock.

' Public Park *?
I Under Way
Abbeville has at last a public park, I
jwhich is a credit to the spirit of progress
which \as of late years stimulated
the town to beautify every
available space in the city. The
1 grounds surrounding the power house
[ and the city water system are being
beautified and are being used evejy
day more and more as a public park.
! The two reservoirs have been enclosed
in close mesh wire with substantial
railings around, which
makes it safe for children, the hill'
'sides around the power house are
(covered with beautiful sward of well
; imowed grass and wide and convenient
walks lead from the several summer
houses which are prettily placed
ion the grounds. 'These summer
houses whifch are covered with matderia
vines and have comfortable
iseats and:electric lights on the inside.

Officials Realize the Increased Cost

11 Operatives.?Many Improvements
'( In Local N&l Village.
The Abbeville Cotton Mill has
I posted notices that it will immediate'
ly increase the wages of its employees
something like ten per cent on
> account of the increased cost in livr
ing due to war prices. The high cost
) jof groceries, clothing anch the other
necessities of life work a great hard[
ship against the wage earners of the
I country in that they have nothing to
sell to secure the advance in prices of
> (all commodities. Realizing this fact
the officers of the cotton mill at this
place have determined to give the increase
of wages although it was not
asked for by the employees.
It is spending a considerable sum
of money in erecting a new school
[ building, plans for whi<;h is now being
drawn. It is installing a system
of sewerage and of water which will
| be taken from deep wells. Lately
iMiss Thompson has come to the mill
village to do community work among
*the operatives. She has made a fine
impression upon the people of the
prill village and they expect to profit
greatly under her leadership. Miss
t Thompson and her sister have rooms
- in the house formerly occupied by
Superintendent Putman. The entire
. lower floor of the building, however,
is used for club rooms, reading
( rooms, etc. for the operatives.
