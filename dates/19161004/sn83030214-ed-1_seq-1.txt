SERIOUSNESS OF
CHARGE ADMITTED
Accused Players Pass Lie,
Calling Game with
Brooklyn Fair.
By W. O. M'GEEHAN.
John .1. McGraw, manager of the
Giants, impugned the honesty of pro
fessional baseball in a spectaeular man
ner yesterday. He strode out of Eb?
bets Field in a red rage when the
Giants. by the:r listiess playir.g, lost
rhc gjinie whieh gave the Brooklyn team
the N%tional League pennant, blurting
out an accusation that his men had not
tried to defeat the Brooklyn team.
It was thc first time in nearly forty
\ears that a player had even hitted at
dishonesty in baseball. The charge
made by McGraw-, coming as it did
after a startling reveisal of form dis
played by the Giants yesterday, is taken
seriously by all conncctcd with base?
ball with thc exception of John K.
Tcncr, president of the N%tional
League.
Two of McGraw's players ? Art
Fletcher, shortstop, and William Per
ritt, who pitched part of the game?
give the lie direct to the statement of
their manager. McGraw himself dis
appcared immcdiately after his dra
matic exit from Kbbets Field and could
r.ot bc found last night.
Had Been Irritated.
McCraw left the bench at Kbbets
Field immediately after Pcrritt allowcd
one of the Brooklyn base runners to
steal second. The Giant manager had
dieplayed eoaaiiarabli irritatiaa before
that. In the third inning he was in
rolred il a field altercation 4vith
Pitcher Benton and Fletcher, and he
was prowir.g more enraged every
minute.
\\ her. Mowrcy, of Brooklyn, advarccd
to seeond through the apparent indif
ference nf iVrritt. McGraw stamped his
foot and iiiddcr.ly du.-hed from the
Held. H il flbaenee was not, noticed by
the crowd until later, for he da hed
through thfl dugout, hurling playiM
out Oi his way.
"That fltafl w-as too miirh for me,"
he inapped to thc interriewera who
sought him in the drtssing room. "I
do not believe any of my pla>ers de
Hberately favored Brooklyn, but they
simply refused to obey my nrders and
they fon]ed about in a listiess manner.
"Through for the Year."
"When Perritt wound up with a man
op tirst base, allowing the runner to
steal second, I loat my patience and
left the bench. I have worked too
hard this year to stand around and
watch playing like that, and I refuse to
be connected with it. 1 am through for
the year."
With this ultimatum McGraw rushed
from the grounds and evidentlv out of
greater New York for the evening. He
araa ??*' none of his usual haunts, and
none of his intimate friends could give
anv clew as to whieh particular tent
thfl enraged Achilles of the Giants had
aeleeted for hia sulks.
The immediate effeet of McGraw's
implied accusation has been to enrage
members of the Xc4v York N'ational
team, who feel that they have been
placed under s cloud with their man
a^r. It will take ronsiderable smooth
n.g over to establish anything like dis
cipline hniong the Giants of next ycaj.
While Mr. Tener is at present in
clined to make light of the mi.tter and
try to gloss it over, there is the Na?
tional Busebsll Commission yet to be
beard from.
"Ifidn't MeBn What He Said."
"I do not beiieve McGraw meatit what
his words might seem to imply," aaid
Mr. Tener. "I am sure that he
..poke in the heat of passion. He plays
baseball With every otinee of nerve and
rnergy tha! is in him. Why, the state?
ment shows that thc man was over
wroagbt, admitting that he made such
a statement."
All douht as to the autln nt ic.ty of
the statement was removerl by John B.
Ko.ster. perreturv of the New York
Giantl. Foster left Kbbets Filld with
Mct.raw, and listened to what he hnd
to say concerning the liltleiaBOll of
the Giaatfl yesterday. ln addittnn, he
has aomething to say for himself re
garding the manner m whieh the (liants
eonducted theaiaelrea on the tield.
"McGraw left in the fifth inning, dia.
gusterl with his. players," he said. "The
men did Bal play baseball; they simply
filled the positloaa. I was not with Mr
liraw when hr- made the supposcd ar
reigntaen! of the team, but I ha\c no

team had thrown him down. And if
McGra* was aore, he was not the only
one who was sore. Anybody would be

The two pla.. ers who ronsider that

New German Peaee
Hint Reaches London
Berlin's Proposal to Quit Belgium and Serbia, Return
Lorraine to France, Reported Made Through
King Albert.
By ARTHLR S. DRAPER.
London. Oct. 3.?German agents, acting through King Al?
bert of the Belgians, suggested recently definite terms to the
Allies regarding Belgium. Serbia and T.orraine. This I leam
irom cxcellent authority.
The proposal included the withdrawal of the Germans from
Belgium, the payment of an indemnity for destruction due to
military occupation, the retirement of the Kaiser's forces from
Serbia without an indemnity and the return of Lorraine to
France.
Although the offer can hardly be considered a formal one.
it is of an official character and is more definite than previous
overtures. King Albert has been approached severai times by
German agents. Last spring the most ambitious of these efforts
was made.
But the Belgian King spurned these offers repeatedly. de
spite the fact that considerablc pressure was brought to bear
by the Germans on various parts of his country.
It is likely that nothing will come of this latest offer. But
it is intcresting because it shows that the Germans are modify
ing their views about the advantages they hold in the military
occupation of neighboring countries.
The new offer to King Albert probably is the first of main'
peaee overtures that will be made during the coming winter.

London, Oct. 3. ?Behind the Ru
manian forces whieh mvaded Bulgaria
near the Dobrudja border yesterday
Austnan monitors to-day destroyed thc
pontoon bridges over whieh they had
crossed the Danube.
The army of inva?ion embraces "sev?
eral battalions," aceording to the Soiia
War Office. Against these forces the
Bulgars and Teutons are now sending
sfrong rietachments.
Meanwhile, thc situation in the Do?
brudja, where the effect cf the Ru
manian .ncursion would tirst react, re
matns obscure. The Teutons, under
Mackensen, are offering stern resist
ancc to the Russians and Rumanians
all along the line south of the railroad
from Constanza to the Danube.
Report Fortrrsses Evacuated.
A Romo report received here to-dsy
states that Mackensen, learful of be?
ing trapped between the Allied armies
? to the north and south, has ordered his
forces to evacuate the Danube fort
'? ressca of Silistna and Turtukai, reccnt
..ly seized from the Rumanians.
' Ti-.-a report l? r^ya-ded here as pre
| ma'.ure. however. Not until they had
tisnsported large forces across the
; Dcnube in Mackensen's rear would the
1 Rumanians present a serious threat. If
Sotia's estimate of the size of the in
radllB1 army is correct, Mackensen can
still cling to his positions in the Do?
brudja without danger.
At the same time, the Rumanians'
ri?ring strokc has had one important ef?
fect. By creating a many-sided threat
against the forccs of the Central
Powers and the territory of Rulgaria
it has caused the transfer of large
numbers of Bulgars. Austrians and
Germaai from other fronts to meet the
menace.
The Bulgars apparently wcakened
their lines in Macedonia. As a result
the Allies advanced along the whole
front to-day. Joint assault by French,
.Seibian and Russian troops north of
I lorina 4von for them four villages?
So4-ick, Petorak, Verbeni and Jenikoi -
guarding the Cerna \ alley linc3 before
Monastir.
King Peter's tror.pa pushed ahead on
their own soil. west. of the Kaimskcslan
ridge, while a British bayonet attack on
the east bank of the Struma eomplete
ly routed the enemy. Admtssion or
most of these reverses ,s made in to
day's official statement from Sona.
Strlke in Transylvania.
Krom the Transylvania front Aus?
tnan and German troops were w-.trt
drawn to form part of the army that is
to operste against the Rumanian ln
vaders of Bulgaria. Here again the
Allied forces took advantage of this
move to attack with all their strength.
They were rewarded with gatns at sev?
eral point.. North of Fogaras, in the
region of Bekokren and Baratulat, the
Teutons admit the !o?- of Kround.
At Orsova, near the Iron dates or
the Danube, progress was made by the
Rumanians. Fiercc battle.s are ragmg
near Petroseny. Hatzcg, south al
Hermannstadt and in thc Alt \ alley,
with the tide slowly turning to the
Rumanians.
The Russians in Ga'.icia are enming
to the aid of King ''crdmand's troops
by attacking furiously along the whole
line, especially desperate fighting
taki'ng place in the Carpathians. It il
felt here that unttl the Czar's troops
are able to force the southern I ar
pathians there is no military advan?
tage to the Rumanians in driving
further in?o Transylvania.
The territory already conquered can
be held with comparatively small
forces, while the bulk of the army can
be used to better purpose elsewhere in
the east.

DEALERS PROMISE
MORE MILK TO-DAY
The three largest milk dis
tributing firms estimate that
between" 50 and 60 per cent
of the normal 2,400.000
quarts arri'.ed yesterday.
They announce that they will
increase their deliveries to
day.
John J. Dillon, leader of
the farmers' strike. asserts
that not more than 25 per
cent of the city supply came
from regular sources. He
predicts further shortage to
day.
Severai railway terminals
report 50 per cent falling off
of cars on milk trains yes?
terday.
Health Department inspec
tors estimate shipments at
40 to 50 per cent of normal.
STORES LACK
MILK ALL DAY
Supply in Delicatess
ens and Groceries
Exhausted Early.
HuntiPg for milk in the delicatessen
stores and groceries of Manhattan yes?
terday afternoon was like chasing the
fictitious pot of gold at the end of the
I rainbow the longer one hunted the
farther off the milk seemed to be. Nina
out of ten of the atores that received
any milk had disposed of it by 7:30
in the morning and a great many
shops that received amall quantities
the day before received none yesterday.
So it was practically impossible to buy
milk in N'ew York yesterday afternoon.
It was said many of the big dairies
made deliveries only to private cus
tomeri in whose families there were
children. Some shopkeepers, who had
milk, refused to sell to any except
their regular trade, and others made
inquiries of would-be purchasers as to
whether the milk was for children. If
so it was sold if not it was often re?
fused.
The proprietor of a delicatessen store
at. 425 Third Avenue said he had ob
tained two-pint bottles of milk by ar
guing ten minutes with the driver who
always served him. He received no un
botUed milk.
Milk Sold Out Quickly.
Another delieateaaaa. at 60? Second
Avenue, received just three pints of
bottled milk instead of its customary
forty pinta. Instead of its customary
eighty quarts of unbottled milk, it re?
ceived only twenty quarts. All this
was gone by 7 o'clock. Many other
delicatessens made reports similar to
these.
t'nable to obtain milk at delicates
aeaa or groceries, many persons turned
to the Nathan Straus milk depote for1
relief, but in vain. Tha Straug milk
etations had their usual aupplies, but
they were eonserving them and refuv
ing to sell to any but their regular cus?
tomers. Most of those buying at the
Straus stations are mothers who get
milk there for their babies, and it was
to assure them their regular supply
that the demands of others wera re?
fused.
At the central laboratory of the
Straus milk stations, at 848 F.ast Thir
ty-second Street, it was said the regu?
lar supply of milk was being received
from farms at (Joshen, N'. Y., whence
the Straus milk comes direct. The
fact the Straus depots do not depend
on local distributers was considere.l
largely responsiblo for the fact their
supply has continued. It was inti
mated, however, that it might be cut
down at any time.
Reports that the price of cheese
might be reduced because many farm?
ers upstate are using their milk to
make cheese instead of selling it were
belittled by both wholesalers and !??
tailers yesterday. As a matter of fact,
the price of all kinds of cream cheese
advanced almost 1 cents a cake yes
rerdiiy. Wholesale prices were raised
from 15 to 88 cents a dop.cn cakes and
most retailerg clapped 2 cents on their;
selling: pric-. Wholesalers, however,
said is increase had no connection
with Jt* milk strike, but that it had
been decided on by the cheese manu
facturers aeveral we*ks ago.
Price of Cheese Advances.
.1. 0, Hubbard, treasurer of S. S.
Prown, manufacturer and wholesaler
of cheese, at 105 First Street, said he
thought there was little chance of the
farmers' competition causing any re
duction in cheese r.riceB.
"In the tirst place," he said. "the
farmers are not equipped for maktng
cheese for this market. They would
not be able to supply the proper qual?
ity, and rtui if they did the shortage
of cheese has been so great for some
time past that any additiona to the
supply which the farmers might make
would be absorbed gladlv. without
causing the market price to drop in the
least."
At the headquarters of the Phenix
Chaaaa ("ompany, 345 (Jreenwich Street,
rarhtCB supplies many delicatessen
stores, it was said the farmers* produet
would cause no drop in prices. for the
rigricultunsts were inexperienced at

to produce sufflcient of good quality to
