vania and Dobruja is continuing with
added violence.
London, Oct. 4. The Rumanians on
both north and south fronts are mak
ing important advances. While Berlin
admitted officially yesterday that Aus-tro-German
troops In Transylvania in
the region north of Fogaras had with
drawn before superior Rumanian forc

War Office announced today. They
were met by an Intense defensive fire
from the Russian guns, however, and
forced back to their positions.
In the Zlota Llpa district and along
other sectors of the front in Galicia,
fighting of a desperate nature is con
tinuing, neither side scoring any
marked advantage.
London, Oct. 3. Owing to the
heavy rain and the necessity of consoll
dating the new positions, there was
very little fighting on the Somme
front today. The British, however,
were kept busy in the sector of Eau
court l'Abbaye, where the Germans
are stubbornly holding the ground.

Went Overank in Automobile Near
Aacutneyville.
Windsor. Oct. 2. Between 7 and 8
o'clock this evening, a big automobile
owned and driven by W. B. Tuxbury
of this place, in which A. Fullerton
rhlllips and W. H. Case, also of this
place, were the other occupants, left
the road about four miles from the
town, near Ascutneyville, and collided
with a nearby tree with such force
that all three men were thrown from
the car.
Mr. Case was killed almost instant
ly. The other two men escaped with
minor Injuries, Mr. Phillips having
quite a few bruises and a cut artery,
which will not, however, prove serious,
while Mr. Tuxbury's injuries are con
fined to bruises alone. The car was
but slightly damaged and was driven
Into Windsor on Its own power.
At the time the accident occurred,
tho men were returning from Lake
Sunapee, where they had been In camp
for several days. They were proceed
ing at a fair rate of speed when they
suddenly came upon a hud piece of
road where extensive repairs were be
ing made. Both Mr. Tuxbury and Mr.
Phillips have been too dazed since the
accident to give a comprehensive and
exact account of how It occurred but
It Is believed by those who visited the
scene and looked over the ground that
the car must have slewed on the bud
road, at which time Mr. Tuxbury was
unable to control It, and the collision
with the tree resulted. The car did
not overturn.

VT. TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION
Expected Educational Treats at Com
ing Convention.
This year the teachers of Vermont
are working as never before to reach
a degree of efliciency that will re
flect credit upon the greatest agency
in education the public school. The
summer session brought together en
thusiastic groups at the college and
normal schouls of the state. Tho
saVredness of the calling and-the re
sponsibility of the worn" were depicted
in the laces of the eager classes in
tent upon growth inteut upon teach
ing the cultured Btatus that social
efficiency demands. The teachers of
the commonwealth are proud that
the hope of the state s past leader is
being welded into a chain of achieve
ment that shall bind the strength of
the past with that of the future.
October 12. 13 and 14 here will as
semble in the city of Burlington the
great educational brotherhood in con
vention, this being the sixty-seventh
meeting in the history of the associ
ation. There will be many speakers
in the various departments men and
women whose deeds have been those
of service whose service has been
such that the rural schools, the high
schools, the universities and the na
tion have compounder the Influence .of
their loyalty and worth. New York
state about two years ago confidently
placed Dr Finley at the head of her
Bchool system. Dr. Fiuley is to be one
of the chief speakers from abroad.
Mrs. Klla Flagg Young, the great
educator, is to be present with the wo
men at their banquet Friday evening.
October 15. The subject of her ad
dress will be, "The Value of the
Teacher."
Here are some of the good things
tllat have been said about this woman,
whose leadership has made her name
a household word:
Mrs. Ella Flagg Young began to
teach In the public schools of Chicago
in 1861. She is known as the 'Mother
of the text book.' Her mind is as
clear as a bell. She has the decisive
ness of a general. Her career has
been worked out in Chicago. She
was, successively, teacher, principal,
member of the faculty of the Universi
ty of Chicago, head of the Chicago Nor
man School, and, finally, superinten
dent of the public school of Chicago.
Mrs. Young is a strenuous friend of
manual training." New York Inde
pendent. "If a woman can successfully con
duct the schools of the second largest
city in the Union, there isn't a little
city school system anywhere to
which a woman may not aspire to he
superintendent. Dr. Ella Flagg Young,
who has so set aside precedent that
she has made say for other women to
follow her, began school teaching as
a girl of eighteen at a time when
public opinion placed outside a wo
man's sphere every other position
which she has since attained. Since
those days she has come all the way
to the top of her profession in the
same city in which she started: grade
teacher, principal, district superinten
dent, professor at Chicago University,
and principal of Chicago Norman
school, before she became superinten
dent. She has earned her own living
since she was graduated at the Chic
ago Normal school. She was more
than forty years old and a district sup
erintendent when she went to college
nnd took her A. B. and (lnnally her Ph.
D., and to these has since been added
L. L. D. That Is about all of tho hon
ors there are coming the way of any
scholar. Her dynamic personality has
electrified the whole school system.
The Delineator.
Mrs. Helen King Chcesman, who
was recently elected president of the
Rhode Island Mothers' Congress and
Parent-Teachers' Association, will be
heard by the women at their banquet
in an Inspiring talk on "On Being a
Good Fellow." The annual banquet or
tho Vermont Woman Teachers' Club
will be held at the University of Ver
mont Gymnasium at 7.30 o'clock Fri
day evening, October 13th.
An opportunity wil be afforded oth
er women of the state to hear Mrs,
Young and Mrs. Cheesman and at the
same time enjoy a social evening with
the teachers. Reservations have been
made for about thirty who are not
members of the club. Miss Marjory

last strike on the system.
Albany, Oct. 4. Strikebreakers will
be operating cars in Albany within
thirty-six, possibly twenty four hours.
Carpenters worked all last night put
ting wire screens on cars lif the North
Albany barns and on all the windows
of the bains and the buildings owned
by the traction company in North Al

those used on the New York street
cars during the strike.
James A. Waddell, "King of strike
breakers," the man who in the last
couple of weeks has broken the strike
of the New York street railway men s
union, Is in Albany "to break the
strike here." With Vice President
Harry B. Weatherwax and Charles F.
Hewitt, general manager of the Unit

the operation of the cars, at a secret
conference last 'night.
.Mr. Waddell refused to say when
the first Albany trolley would be oper
ated, but there is little doubt it will
be not later than tomorrow. He also
refused to say when the strikebreak

Troy, generally, was prepared yes
terday morning for the sympathetic
strike on the part of the Troy local of
tho Amalgamated Association of
Stieet Railway Employes, and early
risers waited only for a short time for
their scheduled cars and then hailed
busses or hiked to their work. Busses
were plentiful.
Many departments in the big collar
factories were short of help during the
morning. Thousands of the women em
ployees were unable to get to their

to work as soon as they arrived, the
rule barring workers more than an
hour late being suspended temporal!

ALONE, CONQUERED 22
Extraordinary Exploit of Canadian
Corporal.
A tale of an unnamed corporal in
an Vastern Ontario battalion of the
Canadian forces in France, who, sin
gle handed charged a party of 22 Ger
mans advancing to an attack and
killed or wounded all of them ex
cept one. whom he took prisoner, is
related by the official Canadian "eye
witness" In a dispatch received at Ot
tawa, Ont., yesterday.
"As a result of further severe light
ing the Canadians have captured sev
eral important German positions and
have advanced their wn line upon a
frontage of nearly two miles to a
maximum depth of 900 yards," said
the dlspuatch. "The Germans have
fought bard and their resistance lias
been formidable. To minimize this
fact would minimize the gallantry and
petslsteuce with which the Canadians
have attacked. We have, In this fight
ing, advanced in close cooperation
and sympathy with the British troops
on either flank. Despite the enemy's
resistance we have, except for tem
porary and local setbacks, secured in
ruccession all of our objectives and by
every account received we have in
flicted severe losses upon the Ger
mans. "Our artillery support has been
magnificent and by the sheer weight
of metal which the gunners have
hurled upon the Germans they have
made it humanly possible for the in
fantry to come into close contact with
tho enemy. When this has occurred
there has never been any question of
the result. Time and time again our
bayonet men have rushed an enemy
trench and have killed or captured
the entire garrison.
"In the course of all this desperate
fighting there have been innumerable
instances of the most courageous and
devoted actions impossible at present
to detail. The case of a corporal of
an Eastern Ontario battalion is, how
ever, one of the most extraordinary
ever recorded. The battalion had sue
cessfully captured a line of German
trenches when a party of the enemy,
consisting of two officers- and about
20 men, began a counter attack.
"The corporal advanced alone
against the whole party, empted his
revolver, picking up first one and
another German rifle each of which
he emptied, accounting for the two of
ficers and 16 of the men. While he
was shooting one of the officers at
tacked him with a bayonet and pierced
him in the leg below the knee hut tho
corporal shot him dead. The rest of
the enemy attempted to escape. The
corporal shot four of them and made
the fifth a prisoner. Although wounded
in two places, he remained in the
trenches until his battalion was re
lieved. NORTH HOOSICK

NATIONAL PENNANT TO BROOKLYN
Two Defeats for Philadelphia Put
Quaker City Out of the
Running.
The Boston American league club
and the llrooklyn Nationals will meet
in tho 191G world's series, the open
ing game of which will be played on
Braves field at Boston Saturday. Tho
teams wi'l remain In Boston over Sun
day and play the second game of the
scries there on Monday, weather per
mitting, alter which they will go to
Brooklyn tor two games at EbbeO
field on Tuesda.i and Wednesday. Tu i
filth and sixth ga;.,es, if necea3ary
will be played on Thursday and Fri
day at Boston and Brooklyn, re
spectively. Should a seventh game be
necessary to decide the series, the lo
cation of the contest will be decided
by the toss of a coin as in past years.
All these details were arranged at
a meeting of the national baseball
commission in New York city yester
day afternoon.
Tentative arrangements already
have been made covering the possibili
ties of either Philadelphia or Brook
lyn in the National League being the
opponents of the Boston Americans
and the schedule of world's series
games was arranged after a short dis
cussion. President Lannin suggested
that the series ho opened at the park
of the Boston Nationals, where " the
American leaguers will stage all their
games, owing to its immense seating
capacity, instead of deciding the place
of the initial games by the custom
mary toss of a coin. This plan was
adopted in view of the fact that both
the Brooklyn and Philadelphia clubi
required several days in which to in
stall additional seats and boxes to ac
commodate the large crowds which
will attend the series.
President Baker of the Philadelphia
club proposed that the series begin
on Monday, but this was vetoed oy
the commission as being an unneces
sary delay, as was a suggestion that
the play start Friday on the grounds
that the National league winner re
quired a day or two of rest before be
ing flung into the world's series
against the Boston Red Sox, who
clinched their league pennant two
days ago. The commission also dis
missed the proposal to alternate the
games between the contending cities
but decided that in case.moro than
four games wero necessary the fifth
and sixth would be alternated, with
the place of the seventh decided by
the flipping of a coin.

SPpRTING GOSSIP "
It is rumored in baseball circles that
the National League has under consid
eration some proposed changes in the
rules, which will be acted upon at the
annual meeting In December. One of
the proposed changes is to abolish the
spitball and make the rule so that no
foreign substance of any kind may be
used by the pitchers. The present rule
would cover the use of the spitball
were it strictly enforced, for it pro
hibits the discloring of the ball with
soil cr otherwise or damaging it in
any way.. Another proposition favored
by some magnates is to change the
foul-strike rule so that only one foul
may be called a strike instead of the
first two as at present. It is said the
short fields at the Philadelphia
grounds will also come In for consider
atlon and a rule may be adopted limit
ing a hit over the ehort fences to two
bases instead of a home run as at
present.
It is rumored in Boston that Percy
Haughton will retire as President of
the Boston Braves at the conclusion of
the present season. President Haugh
ton is interested In several commerci
al enterprises, which demand a great
deal of his attention. Mr. Haughton
is also desirous of returning to the ac
tive command of the Harvard football
coaching.- It is said that in tlie event
of Mr. Haughton retiring as the head
of the Boston Nationals he will be suc
ceeded by George Stallings, the pres
ent manager, and that Fred Mitchell,
who was recently signed to a three
year contract as coach will l'com
manager. No confirmation of the ru
mors could be secured from the
Braves' headquarters, and it is un
likely that any official statement will
be made until after the world s series.
Bill Clymer, former owner and man
ager of the Wilkesbarre team of the
?iew York State League, has come
through with another winner, leading
the Louisville club of the American
Association to the pennant this season
Bill first gained fame as a manager
w ith Columbus 'in the American Asso
ciation, leading four teams to the pen
nant. Then he came to Wilkesbarre in
the New York State League and pilot
ed the Barons to two pennants. Cly
mer has been mentioned several times
as a candidate for a managerial posi
tion in the big show and is deserving
of such a position in view of hi3 suc
cess in the minor league.
Manager Christy Mathewson of the
Cincinnati team has made it known
that one player who Is sure of a place
next sej.Hon is outfielder F.J Rousch,
who went to the Reds with Matty
from the Giants. Matty makes no
secret of his admiration for Rousch
and his ability as a hall player and Is

AMERICAN RED TAPE
Lewis Gun Did Not Even Get a
Trial.
New York, Sept. 30. Col. Isaac N.
Lewis, American inventor of the fam
ous Lewis machine gun, turned down
by the L'nited States army ordance
board and now being used with mar
velous results by the allies In Europe,
has just made a public statement of
the entire controversy, first brought to
the attention of the peop'.o of this
country by the Daily Blank.
Lewis' reply is matte to- a letter
ptlnted in the New York Times and
signed by Brig. Gen. Crozier, chief of
the lame ordnance boarH, in which
Crozier says:
"Col. Lewis never offered his gun to
the ordnance bureau and never to my
knowledge offered it to any ether
branch of the government free of
charge."
"It is evident," then declares .Col.
Lewis, that "Gen. Crozier intended by
tho statement quoted to convey to
your readers the impression that I uid
not in good faith offer by invention
free to my own government before un
dertaking its development and intro
duction abroad.
"The facts are simple. There is
no mystery whatever.
"1. I did offer the gun officially to
the war department. The offer was
made not once but several times dur
ing the period from March, 1910, to
September, 1912, which period covered
the experimental development of the
first service model. The offer was
made to the chief of staff and tho pres
Ident of the board of ordnance and
fortification, Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood.
It was made with the distinct under
standing that in case the gun was
adopted and used by tho United States
government I would receive from the
government no pecuniary recompense
whatever for my rights and interests
in the invention.
"2. 1 did not offer my gun to Gen.
Orozier or to his bureau, it would have
been foolish as well ns futile to have
done so. 1 know from a somewhat
bitter personal experience of more
than 30 years that It would lie bath
futile and foolish for me or for any
other American inventor outside the
bureau Itself to offer any ordnance
invention to the ordnuce bureau iu the
hope that it would tind encouragement
toward development and final accept
ance "3. In the rail of 1912 I made a last
attempt to secure a service test of my
bun by the war department, when, at
tho personal request of tho chief sig
nal officer, I offered lree and uncondi
tionally two guns adapted to firo
Springfield ammunition for use in
aeroplanes during the practical field
manoeuvers of that year. This offer
was accepted by the chief of staff
and Gen. Allen, then chief signal of
ficer, but the guns were not used be-

and stated that the company had do
cided to build at its own expense the
