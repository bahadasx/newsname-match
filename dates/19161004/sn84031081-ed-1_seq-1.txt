American League club and the Brook
j y ii Nationals, will meet in l lie r.ilti

which will I"' played cm Braves' field
nt Huston next Saturday, October ".
The teams will remain in Huston over
Sunday and ilay tin; second game of
the si ricH there on Monday, October
!. after which they will return to
p.iooklyn for two games at Kbhetts
fiel.l on Tuesday and Wednesday,
October 10 and 11. The fifth and
sixth names, if necessary, will be
played on Thursday, October 12, and
Friday, October 13, at Boston anil
Brooklyn. Should a seventh game be
necessary, the location will be de
cided by a toss of a coin.
These details wero arranged today
before the pennant winning in the Na
tional league was not known ut that
time, and the same dates that ap
plied to Itrooklyn and also applied to
the Hiiladelphia Nationals. Before
nightfall, however, the victory of
Brooklyn over New York and the
double defeat administered to the
Philadelphia Nationals by Boston,
clinched the pennant for the lirooklyn
playcis.
originally, it was intended to hold
the national commission conference
here today, but later It was decided
to defer it until tomorrow. Presi
dent John K. Tener of the National
eagi. and 'be irriii n Oarrj- llei
tnann of the commission, arrived in
this city last night, but President It.
II. Johnson of the American league
was n"t expected until tomorrow.
When he appeared early this morn
ing there was a hurried consultation
at which It was decided to hold the
meeting as originally scheduled.
President C. H. Ebbetts of the Btonk
lyn club, V. F. linker of the Phila
delphia dub of the National league,
whose teams were still fighting for the
pennant, and t'vcsioVe' I ,T tannin of
MNmnKPKiMvappwi
the Huston Aim t o.,i...-, wh .......c.TT,
summoned and the commission went
into session shortly before noon.
President I.anning suggested that
the scries be opened at the park of
the Boston Nationals, where the Amor-
lean leaguers will stage all their home
games, owing to its immense seating
capacity, instead of deciding the place
of the initial games by the customary
toss of a coin. This plan was adopted,
in view of the fact that both the
lirooklyn and Philadelphia, clubs
would require several days in which
to install additional seats and boxes
to accommodate the large crowd.
President linker proposed that the
series begin Monday, October 9, but
this was Vetoed by the commission as
being an unnecessary delay, as was
the suggestion that . the, play start
October !. on the grounds that the
-National league winner required a
day or two of rest before being flung
into the world's series against the
Boston club, who clinched their league
pennant two days ago.
The commission also dismissed the
proposal to alternate the games be
tween the contending cities.
J. (1. Taylor-Spink of St. Bonis was
named as the official scorer for the
national commission, and the Baseball
Writers' association chapters of Boston
and Brooklyn were given the right to
nominate one member in each city to
net as second official scorer in his
home city. The visiting scorer will
not act in an official capacity whin"
away from home.
After naming the list of eligible
players of the three clubs and an
nouncing that the commission would
meet for further business at .1 p. in.,
in Boston, Friday, October i, the con
ference adjourned to attend the game
in which Brooklyn captured the Na
tional league pennant after one of the
closest and most exciting races in the
history of the senior league.
The umpires were announced to
night as follows:

was disgusted witii the playing of bis
team, .Manager John .1. M.-Oraw of
the New York National league club,
left the playing field at Kbhetts field
in the filth inning of today's game be
tween Brook I vn and New York and
retired to the club house. Manager
.Mci'ii'iiw did not appiar on the fold
after that inning.
In a slaleiiiint after the game, in
will, h Brooklyn clinched the National
league pennant, Met! raw asserted that
although he did hot believe any of the
players tried deliberately to favor
Brooklyn, they bad refused to obey
orders and had disregarded signals.
"When I'erritt wound up with a
man on first base, allowing the run
ner to steal second, 1 lost my patience
and left the bench," declared the New
York leader. "1 have worked to
hard this year to stand around and
watch playing like that, and I refuse
to be connected with it."
After receiving congratulations over
Brooklyn's victory, Charles II. Kbbetts,
president of the club, announced that
he was ready to retire from baseball
whenever a purchaser for bis club ap
peared, "with the price." President
Kbbetts has l,i'en connected with the
Brooklyn club for thirty-four years,
as secretary and president. He de
clared that as he is Mi years old, he
has. earned a rest and desires to retire.
He asserted that the Mclxecver inter
ests in the lirooklyn club also were
for sale. Ebbtrtts said his ambition to
win another pennant hud been real
ized and that he was ready to trans
fer lirooklyn to other hands.
Manager W'ilbert Kobinson and his
players held n, celebration over their
victory in the club house after the
game. All the players shook hands
