about the room. As the end of the

INFANTILE PARALYSIS HERE.
Two Cases Appeared In Family ot
Fred Gravlin la Well Isolated.
It was a great shock to the town
on Wednesday last to learn that in
fantile paralysis had made its ap
pearance here, the unfortunate child
ren being the two children of Mr. and
Mrs. Fred Gravlin in . the Belknap
block on Railroad
showed symptoms of the disease on
Tuesday and on Wednesday paralysis
of the lower limbs developed, and Dr.
Walsh reported the case to the au
thorities. At the same time a sister
showed signs of the disease in a
mild form.
The children affected are thought
to have been exposed about 10 days
ago while visiting with their parents
in Elmore, ! Vt., at the home .of Mr.
Gravlin's brother. At that time there
was no case in Elmore, but since
then a case has developed in the home
of a neighbor next door to the Gravlin
home. Although no direct contact
has been accounted for, it is thought
that the children may have played
together, and the disease transmitted
in that way.
At a meeting of. the. physicians,
health authorities, trustees and town
selectmen, held Thursday morning,
the situation was gone over carefully,
and it was decided to allow things to
remain as they were, pending a fur
ther spread of the disease. But pre
cautionary methods were considered
in case there were any new develop
ments. At first it was thought best to
procure a location outside of the city
where the two cases already report
ed could be Isolated, as well as any
others that might develop, but tbJs
plan was abandoned for the present.
as. the Gravlin cases are removed
from any danger of contact within
or outside the block.
The known contact of the sick
children with others prior to the
' sickness have been so few that the
chances for a further spread of pa
ralysis in St. Johnsbury are thought
to be slight. An interview with
many of the doctors in town showed
that the majority of them were ol
the opinion that all precautions nec
essary for the present had been tak
en. They were practically unani
mous in saying there Was no need for
any hysteria concerning an epidemic.
No new cases of. infantile paraly
sis had been reported to the health
authorities Monday night. and
they are beginning to hope that the
disease has been brought to a halt
in town. The cases of the Gravlin
children on Railroad street are re
ported by Dr. Walsh as improving
and a speedy recovery is hoped for in
both instances.

CO. D MASCOT DEAD
Bull-dog Contributed by Palmer Bros.
Succumbs to Vermont Climate.
Succumbing to an over-developea
case of surliness .and after making
the trip to the Mexican border with
Co. D, the bull-dog mascot of the
company passed away recently in
Burlington. The dog was given to Co.
D, before it left for the border, by
the Palmer Bros, on Eastern avenue.
The canine whjch was a big bull-dog
weighing about 4 0 pounds, had an ad
venturous life while at the front it
reports be true, and but few days
passed by without a victory or de
feat marked up in figTits with othes
dogs.. The sudden change in climate
and the loss of camp excitement was
said to have made the pup aggres
sively melancholy, necessitating a
sudden demise.

delightful days, and from there jour

Java, China and Japan. She not
only described graphically the Inter
esting places visited, but gave some
of the impressions made upon her
and little personal touches which
make any talk so much more enter
taining. She said that one of the
things which impressed her most was
the vast amount of water in the
world and the literalness of the
boast of England that "Britannia
rules the waves." The speaker gave
no tiresome details but in the case of
each place visited told a few interest
ing things of the sort that would re
main in a tourist's memory. She
brought with her many photographs
and souvenirs which were passed
