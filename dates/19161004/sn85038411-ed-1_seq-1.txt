Answer in Political Probe j
Washington, Oct. 4. Justice Staf
ford of the District of Columbia Su- |
preine Court rendered a decision to-1
day requiring Milton H. Smith, presi- |
dent, and other officials of the Louis- ;
ville and Nashville Railroad to answer
questions propounded by the Inter- '>
state Commerce Commission regard- i
ing its political contribution.
The court held the commission has !
the right to know about such contri- i
buttons, not because of their political
nature, but because they affect ques- i
tions of the reasonableness of rates, i
and important questions of railroad !
accounting.
Mr. Smith refused several months'
ago to answer questions of Joseph W.
Folk, counsel for the commission, in I
an inquiry into the affairs of the
Louisville and Nashville, Chattanooga j
and St. Louis railroads based upon a
Senate resolution. A series of such
questions dealing with alleged politi
cal contributions was submitted, ap-!
proved by Chairman Meyer, of the
commission and unanswered by Mr.
Smith, on the advice of his counsel. I

ICE CREAM MEN
NOT TO BLAME
FOR POOR MILK
City Health Officer Says State
Should Provide For Inspec
tion of All Dairies
16 NEW CASES TODAY
Results of Tests Made by City
Bacteriologist Given to
Public by Raunick
Results of ice cream tests made by
City Bacteriologist George R. Moffitt
lust month when the typhoid fever
epidemic first started, were made pub
lic: to-day by city health officials.
Practically all of the tests showed
the presence of cooln bacilli and Dr.
J. M. J. Raunick, city health officer,
in discussing the complete report said
that it only shows more conclusively
the need of State and city laws pro
viding farm and dairy inspection with
the grading of the milk and cream
supply of the public.
According to the health official
filthy conditions on the farms are re
sponsible for much of the disease in
the milk and cream and when the
supply is shut off from one source the
unscrupulous farmer or dairyman
ships it through another and the city
has no way to prosecute or prevent
this.
State Inspection Needed
Ice cream manufacturers, it was
said, are not entirely to blame be
cause of contaminated cream as they
do not have complete reports of the
condition of each dairy shipping milk
or cream to then). State laws pro
viding for inspections of each dairy
farm are absolutely necessary, health
officials claim.
The proposed city ordinance which
was discussed again this afternoon by
Dr. Raunick, and milk dealers, will
provide for inspection of farms and
dairies, and will be a big help in pre
venting any more epidemics as serious
as the one .now at its height in the
city, according to health authorities.
1(1 New Cases
Sixteen new cases of typhoid fever
were reported to Dr. Raunick, making
a total of 41 for the first three days
of October. Ten more patients were
admitted to the Harrisburg hospital
to-day, making a total of 55 cases un
der treatment in that institution.

Two Hucksters Arrested
on Short-Weight Charge
J. H. Knisely and G. L. Michaels,
two hucksters, charged with giving
short weight and measure in selling a
woman two bushels of potatoes, were
arrested this morning by Officer Kautz.
They were held for a hearing this aft
ernoon. According to the story which
the woman told Chief of Police Wetzel
yesterday the men sold her two
bushels of potatoes. Investigation
showed that they weighed only 09
pounds, instead of 120 pounds re
quired by law. Chief of Police Wetzel
said that he is determined to break
up the habit of giving short weight
and measure and officers have been
instructed to arrest any hucksters or
peddlers who violate the city weights
and measures ordinances. City In
spector of Weights and Measures
Harry D. Reel and City Solicitor D.
S. Seitz appeared at the hearing this
afternoon as prosecutors.

437 MEMBERS IN
2 DAYS'CAMPAIGN
Chamber of Commerce Com
mittee Hope to Bound Out
1,000 This Week
Four hundred and thirty-seven
members have come into the Chamber
of Commerce in the past two days.
This is the result of the membership
campaign started yesterday. Commit
tees were out in all parts of the city
to-day. Much of the work they did
was of a missionary nature. Blanks
and literature were left with many
men who wanted to consider the mat
ter or to talk over with partners or
directors of companies the number of
memberships they will take and a
great increase in the number of new
members is expected to-morrow. Fri
day will be the banner day of the four
and It Is confidently expected that the
Chamber will pass the thousand mark
set for it when the committeemen
began their rounds.
The first two days have given the
Chamber 37 members more than the
total of 400 which had been its high
water mark.
Generally the committees were met
in the most friendly manner. Nearly
] every refusal -was for good reason.
11 discourtesies were so few that they
stood out sharply in two instances in
i the reports of subcommittees. Cut
I "no" will not be taken for an answer.
; To-morrow other committees will call
j upon those who declined to-day, if
j they gave no good reason, and it is
j believed that few will turn down mem
bership in the Chamber once they
I have had time to think it over at
I length.
The committees, as usual, made re
ports at luncheon at the Harrisburg
Club. ex-President Henderson Gilbert

West End Business
Section to Have New
Lights by Christmas
Before the Christmas holidays the
West End's business section—North
Third street from North to Calder—
will be attractively lighted with or
namental standards of the type sim
j ilar to those in service in North Sec
| ond street.
Council yesterday approved the
I contract for the lighting of the sec
! tion, after the Harrisburg Light and
Power company had co-operated
i with City Commissioner Bowman to
the extent of agreeing to place forty
four lights at $7,915 —the figure at
which hau originally been agreed up
ion to install thirty-six cluster stand
lards. The intention had been to ex
tend the lights from North to Verbeke
streets but the businessmen of the
West End united in a demand for an
extension of the service to Reily
street. Lack of funds prevented this,
but by the installation of the single
standards, it was possible to add an
! additional block of lighting. C. M.
; Kaltwasser, general manager of the
| company said the material is arriving
•so that the job can be started within
the next few days.
"When we make up the budget for
next year I will say this finally—pro
vision will be made for lighting Fed
eral Square with the ornamental
standards if we don't do another bit
of lighting," emphatically declared Mr.
Bowman to-day.

WILSON SPECIAL
GOES THROUGH
Befuses to Make Bear-End
Platform Speeches; On Way
to Omaha
President Woodrow Wilson and
party, en route to Omaha, where he
speaks to-morrow night, passed
through Harrisburg early this morn
ing. When the special train reached
this city fro Washington, D. C., at
1.25 everybody but the porters and
Secret Service men were sleeping. No
prolonged stops will be made until the
train reaches Chicago to-night.
In his party are Mrs. Wilson, Secre
tary Tumulty, Dr. Cary T. Grayson, the
White House physician, and a corps of
Secret Service men and stenographers.
Mr. Wilson remained at worl: until
late last night replying to correspond
ence.
In spite of persistent attempts on
the part of Democratic leaders to have
the President deliver a number of rear
platform speeches on the way to
Omaha, he absolutely refused to make
any such plans.
The President took the position that
he will not make a stumping tour to
aid his campaign. He passed through
several states where he has been urged
to speak, but persisted in his de
termination not to make a political
"swing."
If the President's plans are carried
out, his Omaha speech, like those to
be delivered later in Indianapolis. Chi
cago, Cincinnati and New York will
not be partisan, although all undoubt
edly will deal with subjects of a po
litical character.

PRY INTO AGED
HARRIS WILL FOR
I COURTHOUSE DATA
County Commissioners to Re
ceive Report on Inquiry at
Friday's Meeting
CONFER ON PROBLEM
Recent Law Permits Erection
of Joint Building if Grant
Permits It
Old deeds and grants, musty and
yellow with the passage of the
and perhaps the equally ancient and
lcce.iiliy revamped will of John Har
ris who laid cut Harrtsburg, will be
examined by County Solicitor Phil S.
Mover vithin the next few days so
that he can s-übmit a report to "he
county commissioners as to what
steps cen bi taken officially towari
the erection of a new courthouse i>nd
municipal building for Dauphin
county.
At to-day':' meeting of the county
commissioners County Solicitor Moyer
took up the problem and placed be
fore them what facts are already of
record as to the county and city's
ftatus on the subject.
Several jears ago Mr. Moyer said
the county commissioners asked for
mer Countv Solicitor Middleton to
look into the matter and at that time
the county attorney reported that no
action could be taken because of a
hitch in the Harris grant of the court
house sile as well as from a legal
standpoint.
Since then however, an act has been
placed on the statute books, which
in Mr. Moyer's opinion, will permit
the county and city to join in the
courthouse movement provided no
flaw in the project is presented by the
terms of the Harris grant.
In County Commissioner Wells'
opinion the present site was deeded
by Harris for county and municipal
buildings and just what bearing this
might have sliculd the two combine
'o erect a rcw building, is a matter
that has been raised by the action of
the September quarter sessions grand
jury in lecom.nending the erection of
another courthouse. The last recom
mendation was the third consecutive
suggestion of its kind to be presented
to the court and this permits definite
action by the authorities.
Mr. Moyer said he will look up the
old papers in the matter to-morrow
in order that he may have something
to report on tile problem at Friday's
meeting of the commissioners.
