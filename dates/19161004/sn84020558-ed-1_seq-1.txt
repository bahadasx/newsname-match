' How do you do?" said Mr. Taft. j
"Mow do you do'.'" Mr. Roosevelt,
rejoined.
F.aoh bowed and M' Roosevelt
passed on to shake hands with other
guests, leaving Mr. Taft to greet those
who followed. A few moments later
Mr. Roosevelt took his pia-e in the re-,
reiving line. He stood between Mr.
Hughes and Channeey .M. Depew. Just'
the other side of Mr. Depew stood Mr.
Ta ft.
Thus, standing in the same receiv
ing line they slump hands with tiie
hundreds of club members and their
guests who filed past during the even
inn. They did not meet again, how
fc r. or exchange any other words
than commonplace greetings.
'We shook hands." Mr. Taft said af
terward, "just like any gentlemen
would shako hands."
Colonel Roosevelt declined to com
ment on the meeting.
After the hand shaking was over and
the library was cleared. Klihu Root,
president of the club, escorteM Mr.
Hughes through a fiag draped corridor

Abraham Lincoln. Mr. Root again in

made a brief address.
Colonel Roosevelt and Mr. Taft were
called upon by Mr. Root and each re
sponded with a short talk.
The meeting between Colonel Roose
eR ;,nd Mr. Taft was the first since
April 1.1, 1015. when both were pall
beaters at the funeral of Thomas
T.ounsberry. professor of English at
Yale diversity and a close friend of
both, on that occasion they merely
i-hook hands, exchanging no-words.
Tonight's reception was arranged

in progress when Mr. Hughes and

There was a moment hush and then
th crowd cheered Mr H"gbs.
Mr. Root escorted Mr. Hughes to the '
library, temporarily convened into a
reception parlor, and George R. She!-!
lon took Colonel Roosevelt's arm.
'rosing the room to where the re-1
eiving line was forming. Colonel j
Roosevelt shook hands with eight or;
nine persons, among them being Wil-j
I. am M. Cab'.er, republican nominee fori
senator from New York; Robert Ba-j
con, George von L. Meyer, and Mr.
I'epew. Then came the meeting be
tween Colonel Roosevelt and Mr. Taft.
They had changed in appearance
nce the time they Inst exchanged
greetings. Roth were somewhat grey--r
than they were then, with the lines
of their faces dcepenlne- into wrinkles.
And Mr. Taft was nearly 10u pounds
heavier when he was president than
now.
When brought face to fare tonight,
bv Mr. Sheldon, there was no word of
introduction -no time for it. For a
fraction of a second their eyes met aim
each looked into the other's unsmiling
face. Then Mr. Taft extended his hand
and Colonel Roosevelt took it.
There were other hand shakes of a
formal nature. Among them were the
meetings between George W. Perkins I
and Mr. Taft and betwen Cob-nel
Roosevelt an.l Hoies Penrose, senator
from Pennsylvania. As in the case of I

issues of the campaign, both state and

"Presider-t Wilson is i: man of high

man but he Is obviously not fitted for

New Mexico, Governor ISeCkman of
mode Island, Mr. Willcox. Mr. Ca'.dcr,
Senator Weeks, Mr. Bacon and W.
Camoicn Forbes. The line of guests
was nearly two hours m passing and
then the speaking began.
"Wf have heard in recent years,"
Mr. Hughes said, in his address, "Hint
tne alternative of the policy of the
present administration is war. I think
the alternative of the policy of the
present administration is peace at the
price of honor. We are not courting
struggle, but 1 do say with all seri
ousness that we have been living- i-i
a period of n 'tura! humiliation."
"Go: d! shouted Colonel Roosevelt.
"Our citizens have been murdered,
their property destroyed and our com
merce interrupted." Mr. Hughes added
"The alternative of a weak and vacil
lating policy is not war, it is a firm
insistence upon known rights in a
world -viler-? all x. 11 rs de.ore our

To cries of "Teddy, Teddy Teddv,"

form at the close of Mr. Hughes' ad
dress. "No man has the right to claim

of disseminating and utilizing race

saloons here. Occasionally he would
break in on a witness and adroitly in
duce him to reveal that other forms of
gambling, poker craps and baseball

spent a busy day, adding to'the dis
comfort of some politicians.
The confessions of two former em

resulted in yesterday's raid, were made
public today and contained assertions
that the sale of life memberships to
saloon-keepers and gamblers at $100
a membership was a well systematized
and developed branch of the club's or

The confessions also revealed that
after saloon-keepers had made ar
rangements with Charles T. Kssig, sec
retary of the club, they were allowed
to maintain slot machines unmolested.
Thomas 10. l'hilbine. a club employe,
who was sent out to urge saloon-keepers
to install slot machines, said that
a private customer had been skeptical
until he had to call in a policeman to
assure him it was all riyht.
The policeman, he' said, took a slip of
paper apparently an order, out of his
hat and showed it to the saloon-keeper,
convincing him the machine would not
be molested by the police. The total

CONTROVERTED
(Special to The Republican)
NEW YORK. Oct. 3. Mr. Leigh,
president and General manager of the
Chicago Railway F.quiprnent company,
has sent to Chairman Willcox, of the
republican national committee, a letter
in which he takes up for consideration
a number of statements in the recent
article by Secretary Lane, in defense of
President Wilson's Mexican policy.
For a good many years Mr. Lei.-rh has
been in intimate touch with Mexican
affairs and is in a position to receive
la great deal of interesting ti.:id authen
tic information as to what was really
going on in that troubled country. His
letter throws a strong li'ht upon the
Wilson policy with regard to Mexico
and furnishes a new explanation of the
reason for the deliberate adoption by
Mr. Wilson of the policy of refusing to
protect American lives and prop-Tty
in Mexico.
Mr. I,eich quotes Secretary I-ine as
saving. President uson s .Mexican
i policy has not been weak and vacillat
1 in?;. It has been definite and consist
ent, firm and constructive." Com
menting upon this, Mr. Leigh says that
Secretary Lane could only have meant
that Mr. 'Wilson's policy was Lrtir and
definite in its determination to make
Huerta go regardless of methods ami
consequence; rei.!r-l!eL;s of human life,
human suffering. hum:in rights or cost.
Mr. Lan-, however, made a mistak - ir.
using the word construct ive. He meant
destructive. There is not any evidencc
of Mr Wilson's constructive work. On
the other hand. Mexico is a monument
of his desiructive work. He destroyed
tho existing governn.cnt. but provided
nothing to succeed ii. .u.d anarchy re
sulted and still prevails-.''
"Mr. Lane further says: 'The policy
of the I'nited States (meaning Mr. Wil
son's) is one cf hope and helpf ulness,'
for those who have lost their lives or
the ace-inmlations of u liietime. or for
the miiliori-; of Mexican people de
prived of home, or property, of the right
even to iivc in Mexico, and v ho are lit
erally dying by starvation, this is pure
mockery.
"Mr. Wilson's condemnation and
abandonment of American citizens in
Mexico is unparalleled. R is not true
that the Americans most interested in
Mexico advocated or tried to force in
tervention. From the beginning it war
what they most feared and they were
practically united in opposing armed in"
tervention. Particularly they opposed
the intervention by the administration
in Mexico's internal affairs and poll
tics, and for this opposition they in
curred the enmity of President Wilson
and his advisors and have been re
peatedly classed by him as liars, as be
longing to the predatory class for w'mm
he consistently refused recognition,
sympathy or protection.
"The state department toll these
Americans in so many words that their
advice was not wanted. They had
gone to Mexico to make tnonev and
bad taken their chances; if they did not
like it they could come home; they
could not loci: to the American govern
ment to protect either them or their
properties.
"Every American having an interest
in Mexico i.vns an 'adventurer,' the jus
tice of which has its counterpart in the
equally unfair doctrine -hat every suc
cessful business man is a thief."
If all Americans living or doing busi
ness in a foreign country are to be
classed as "adventurers" and without
protection, what is the use of all our
talk and effort looking to the extension
of our foreign trade and interests? The
object lesson of the desertion of our
own citizens and their interests in
Mexico has been more significantly
noted by other countries than bv o.i'

and such a policy will snreiv

The secretary's statement was the

Hanly urged that in the face of this
record Nebraska could ill afford to vote
wet, not only for her own sake, but for
the effect the action would have on
the national situation.
"South Dakota and Montana are go
in" dry," Hanly said. "Utah will elect
a dry legislature. Idaho will ratify its
dry amendment. Washington. Oregon,
Arizona and Colorado will either
strengthen their dry laws or decline to
weaken them. In California the wet

struggle. Nevada may vote on the
question next year.
