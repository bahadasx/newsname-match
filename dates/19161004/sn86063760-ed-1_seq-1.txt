Piracy Depending Upsn Situaties
Berlin, via Sayville.-In an extend
ed speech on the occasion of th
opening of the Reichstag hers
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg re
viewed the military situation con
fronting Germany and refrred tU
England as "our most egoistic, os
most bitter and our most tenacious
enemy." according to the semi-oficia
report of the Oversias News Agency
"A German statesman who would
refrain from using against this enem:
every proper means of warfare whici
is apt to shorten the war deserves t
be hanged," is one of the statement
attributed to the Chancellor. Thi
Chancellor began by reviewing a
length the entry of Rumania into the
war and said that the Russian offen
sive this spring had made Premie:
Bratiano believe he saw the break
ing down of the Central Powers.
"Accordingly." the speaker said
"he decided to obtain a share whez
the robbery of the dead body began.
"Since the beginning of world was
Rumania has followed a policy of pi
racy. depending upon the general was
situation. Rumania's military capitu
lation will prove as mistaken as her
political capitulation to her Entente
friends, which already has been prom
ed to have been wrong. They mus1
have hoped earnestly that Rumana's
particilation in the war would cause
the defection of Bulgaria and Turkey
but Bulgaria and Turkey are not the
same as Rumania and Italy. Firm
and inviolable stands their faithful
ness as allies, and they have won
glorious victories in Dobrudia."

NEWS FROM BORDER CAMP 1
r
a
A Weekly Letter, Prepared Especially
For Our Readers, From the South
Carolina Guardsmen Encamped at r
Fort Bliss, Texas. f
r
In Camp with the South Carolina t
Brigade, in the El Paso Patrol District. a
The First Sou" Carolina infantry t
will soon be distributed over a 90- p
mile outpost line from Las Cruces, n
New Mexico, to Fort Hancock, Texas. 0
The regiment will be broken into F
companies and assigned to outpost t
stations at the small towns east and v
west of El Paso. b
The combined First and Second a
regiments of South Carolina infantry b
marched as one regiment in the big p
military review parade, and although b
they are recent arrivals at the bor- a
der lost fewer men through exhaus- o
tion than the troops of any other h
state.
Arriving at 4 o'clock in the morn- ti
ing the men did not complete the re- i
view until nearly sundown. Besides d
being under restraint all day the sol- d
diers marched 20 miles with field S
equipment. That the South Carolina h
men so ably stooY the experience e
speaks well for their natural endur- p
ance, because they have not passed ft
through the hardening process the S
other troops here have received, a,
Brig. Gen. Roger Williams of Ken- o:
tucky commanded the provisional T
brigade, which was created for the a:
occasion by merging South Carolina te
and Kentucky troops. a:
Field training by regiments began h
in the South Carolina camp Septem- ti
ber 18th and continued to the 25th. a
Both of the regiments were inspected o
and reviewed by a member of the
staff of Brig. Gen. George Bell.. Jr., f(
commanding the El Paso district. a
The regiments were out in full force, d
the macnine gun companies with tr
their Lewi: guns on the motor trucks fr
being along wi'h the rest of the b
units comprising the regiments. ei
Both organizations showed up nicely.
Since coming to the border over I
six weeks ago the Palmetto regiments di
have been trained in companies and tl
battalions and are now working on d:
training by regiments. This will be p
followed by field training of the 3
brigade under Col. W. K. Wright. ir
The South Carolinians were in pretty fr
good shape when they came to the fc
border and the service they have
gone through with here has hardened p,
and seasoned them and brought them m
to a high state of preparation for sol- it
diers. p
South Carolina is said to be the be
third best drilled, best equipped and a
best trained National Guard organi- a
zation on the border. The state of be
Massachusetts is generally credited ca
with heading the list. That South
Carolina ranks third is very gratify- i
iug when everything is taken into di
consideration. The Palmetto regi- y
ments are equipped much better than o
the average National Guard organiza- Fa
tion and came to the border much
better in this respect than the aver
age guard organization, according to a
gossip around the camps. Of course, 0r
nobody has made any official state- o
ment on this matter and will prob- T
ably not do so, but this is what is ly
heard almost every day in comments al
from those who ought to know., cc
When the final rating is made there .
(s little doubt that South Carolina T
will be in the front rank of efficiency,
training and in every way. Fi
Massachusetts first, Michigan sec
ond and South Carolina third is the
standing of the National Guard or
ganizations from unofficial remarks
which have been picked up. Both
Massachusetts and Michigniwere on WI
the border six weeks before the Pal- et
metto troops came and if this stand- 0
ig is correct the showing of the t~
South Carolinians is surprisingly 81
gratifying. Give them the same per- hi
od en the border and the same time 01
in field training and South Carolina's tr
lads will go to the top. The officers Ie
and men have worked hard and faith- th
fully since coming here and if every ~
National Guard organization has tak
en advantage or its opportunities as
the Palmetto boys have done it's go
ing to be hard to tell them from the* C
regular army. ci
The biggest review of any army ~
held since the Union army paraded "
up Pennsylvania avenue in Washing- P
ton at the close of the War Between ti
the States will take place in El Paso ~
on Thursday when 36,000 olive drab
men will tramp through the streets
to the martial strains from 40 bends e
and be reviewed by Brig. Gen. George s'
Bell. Jr.. commanding the El Paso Ic
district, and Maj. Gen. Clements, a
commanding the Pennsylvania - divis
ion. The troops which participate in h
the parade will be commanded by a
Brig. Gen. Charles V. Morton. com- F
manding the provisional Ninth divis-S
ion composed of the South Carolina li
and Kentucky troops. The parade tc
will be 15 1-2 miles long. The re- n
viewing stand will be located at Fort N
Bliss is one mile below the Palmetto L
camp and six miles from El Pa so. bi
The troops will tramp on through the jb<
main streets of El Paso. Every
branch of the service will be in line. tI
South Carolina will be in the picture tg
with two regiments of infantary, one n
troop of cavalry, one company of en- a
gineers and one field hospital, finely gj
trained and well drilled men, "fit for t
fighting." f

3 RESTORE OLD STATE ROAD
~derai Engineers Regard Project to.
Rehabilitate Famous Old Highway a
as Entirely Feasible. d
Columbia.-Efforts that have been
der wvay for some time to recon-d
ruct and reopen the direct line from
>lumbia to Charleston, known as
e Old State road, took definite
ape in Columbia at a conference t
d at the offices of the department f
agriculture, commerce and indus- f
ies. Much enthusiasm was mani
sted, and the next ten days will tell
e tale as to whether or not a proper3
an highway will be opened from 1
e city of Charleston in time for the
11 and winter traffic.
The conference was called by I
>nmissioner Watson, who has been
-operating with the central com-e
ittee formed at a meeting some 1
eeks ago at Holly Hill for the pur-.
se of going over the entire situa-1
Dn and seeing whether it was con
dered worth while to attenpt to do
ith the 01(1 stato road what was ae
mplished last season with the Ap
lachian highway.
There was present at the confer
ie: James O'Hear; Reid Whitford,
icretary and engineer of the Char
ston sanitary and drainage comn
ission; Jenklus Robinson; W. K.
'cDowell and William Burgeson. the
.ghway committee of the Chamber
Commerce of Charleston; William- I
rampton, representing Samuel G.
:oney, president of the South Caro
na Agricultural society of Charles
n; John B. Wiggins and A. B. Ben-3
att of Holly Hill. representing the
idsetion organization; John W.
lard and William Otis di Colum
a. representing the Columbia Chain
r of Commerce, and others.
Commissioner Watson, in outlining
e purpose of the conference, stated,
Lat United States Highway Engi
er Scales and United States Drain
e Engineer Eason had completed
eir surveys and examinations of.
Le territory and had presented grati
'ing reports indicating that the road
id be rehabilitated and put in ex
~llent all the year round condition
the cost of only a few thousand
)11ers.
Tt Was manifest, he said, that the
only way that any highway could be
established connecting the most im
portant and attractive city in the
state with the capital and the inter
ior, possibly for years to come, was
through the means of a combined
effort on the part of the people of
the towns and cities concerned and
the people living along the line; that
the people had been waiting for years
for something to be done, and there
was not a single connection worthy
of the name of highway between the
coast, the capital and the interior.
The people around Holly Hill and in
that section had already 'manifested
an absorbing interest, had raised con
siderable money aud had pledged
contributions of teams and labor,
and it was simply now a question as
to whether or not those who would
benefit from the reponing of the high
way and the turning of the tide of
traffic "in that direction wished to
pull together in one general move
ment to push the thing through.
Show Fine. Cattle and Hogs,
Orangeburg.-A special feature of
the live stock conference, to be held
at Orangeburg on October 11 and 12,
will be an exhibit of pure bred cattle
and hogs from among the best breed
ers in the state. As the principal ob
ject of this meeting is to stimulate
interest in the raising of live stock
and diversified farming, it is believed
that such an exhibit will serve the
very valuable purpose of demonstrat
ing how succsesfully pure bred stock
can be raised in South Carolina and
the pecuniary benefits to be derived
therefrom. L. I. Guion of Lugoff has
agreed to send 12 head of Herefords
to this exhibit, and L. W. Boykin of
Camden will send nine head of Short
horns. The other breeds will be rep
resented also and the different kinds
Af hogs.
Big Loss By Fire.

30 tons of cottonseed were almost
otally destroyed by fire entailing loss
)f $10,000 with only $1,500 insurance.

argest farmers in the Gourdin sec

It was considered probable that1

TRAVELED BY PARCEL POST
Englishman Duly Forwarded to His
Destination on the Payment of a
Small Sum.
The parcel post has made its
mess felt in many ways, une as
well as foreseen. But the En par
eel post does one surprising t1ag.that
has not yet been introduce?nto our
own system. -
An Englishman wished reach a
eustomer living in a re part of :
Balham, one of the suburbs London
and it was very necessary -fiat he.f.nd
htm quickly. Knowing notlng o' tr.
district, he called at the
office at St. Martins-le-G to
suit a directory.. On exp a ng s
ease to a dierk he was aiazed to
learn that he could be sent 1 uh
dress by parcel post by pa.
of six cents a mile.
The gentleman had never h
such a thing, and it i.- . that- v
few persons in Engla_.d know t
can be done. le was placed in ch
of a messenger who w:as familiar wil
all parts of the city, and was soon on
his way. The boy carried a printed
slip on which was written a descrip
tion of the "parcel" in charge, under
the heading, "Article required to :e
delivered," and before leaving the c
tomer's house both' the customer
the gentleman had to put their signa
tures on the paper. The limit its
weight Tor anything delivered by
oel post in England is generally un
stood to be eleven pounds, but th.
is one clause that reads: "A per

War is not all horror and death, as
the following little story illustrates:
On Christmas eve as a division of
Hungarian Honveds marching
the Tara district in Montenec
descending the serpentine road
ing down steeply from the mount
the first regiment passed by o
wayside shrine of the Virg:
child. Two men stepped se.
out of the ranks, lighted two
candles and placed them before
images.
Many others followed their exar
and the' number grew to prob.
1,000 altogether. It was dusk
the spectacle of the tiny flames hi-.
ering clear in the still wintry air v..
a dramatic spectacle to behold.
So numerous were the gray wore

of Honveds dug their tapers intc
ground around It.
Thewho.le snow-covered meadow c:
which the shrine stood had been co^

names. Silently the men stood, send-,
ing their Christmas prayers to the
"Christkind."
Then the snow and the dark an

New Bullet Extractor.
Art ingenious instrument has been
Iavented to aid surgeons in extracting
bullets from wounds. The bullet is 1o
cted by means of X-rays and a pair of
forceps. A very powerful pair of for
eps is necessary to grip and extract a
bullet, and a great deal of amage
might be done if something that was
not seen, perhaps an artery or a nerve,
was picked up along with the bullet.
Accordingly, the blades of the forcens
are attached to an electric bell wh4
only ring's when both the blades s
touching the bullet. Therefore, if the
bell is made to ring while the blades
are being opened to grasp the bullet,
and If the boll continues to ring when
the bullet is seized, nothing else,can
have been picked up beside the bullet,
and there is. uo danger in -pulling it
ut
The surgeon using this instrument
an therefore not only see what he is
oing, but, by means of the bell, Ire
has a very accvrate sense of touch for
any picce of m~etal that he is watching
the points of his forceps attempting to
pick up from among the structures
eep down below the skin.
