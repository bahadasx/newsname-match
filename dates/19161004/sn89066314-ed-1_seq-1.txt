The result still is in doubt.
At the same time the fighting in
Dobrudja atti in Transylvania, -where
the Rumanians are on the offensive,

A COLUMBIA COUXTRV CLUB
With the ratification of the trans
fer of the building of the Columbia
Club to the Missouri Student-Alumni
Union, the club became homeless. But
the organization may not cease to
exist, as at first thought. In the
words of Mark Twain, "the news of
the death was greatly exaggerated."
A committee was appointed from the
club to secure new quarters. Many
members of tie Columbia Club wish
the club to continue.' It is an or
ganization that should not be allowed
to die.
t Whether or,, pot the Columbia Club
continues, Columbia should have a
country club. It is one of the few cit
ies of this size which has not such a
club. Sedalia, Jefferson City, Hanni-
ii
bal. Excelsior Springs, Fulton and
other smaller cities are operating
country clubs with success. Why
should not Columbia also have a
country club; a place where the citi
zens and their families can meet so
cially and for recreation.
The possibilities of the country
club are unlimited. It would not be a
club for the men of the city alone but
for their wives and children. The
business men of Columbia and the
members .of the University faculty
would have opportunity to get away
from the town, away from desks and
places of business and take their
families into the open. The club
should have golf links, tennis courts
and club house. The distance need
not be prohibitive for those who do
not own motor cars.
Why not a country club?

COLUMBIA, MISSOURI, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER-4,
COUNCIL TALKS OVER
CITY STREET FAULTS
Dr. T. B. Cole Complains
College Avenue Pave-
ment Is Breaking.
SEVERAL PLANS UP
O. D. Kellogg Holds That
$12,000 a Year Is Necessary
to Keep Work Going.
Street paving and the condition of
Columbia's streets were discussed at
the regular meeting of the City Coun
cil last night Dr. J.B. Cole criticised
the poor condition of some of the
city paving.
I refer to College avenue, the 'best
street In the city," said Doctor Cole.
"It is breaking down. , The base ma
terial is wrong. The property owner
has no way to protect himself. r The
council should make some provision
for the repair of the city streets."
Councilman O. D. Kellogg today
said that Doctor Cole 'was right In
some of his contentions. However,
Mr. Kellogg said, the streets that have
been paved in the last two years are
proving satisfactory. The streets that
are breaking down are old ones, and
they 'are breaking down from lack of
proper Inspection or of faulty con
struction, according to Mr. Kellogg.
The expense incurred in the Inspec
tion of streets is now paid by the con
tractor. Councilman Percy Klass
thinks the Inspection should be matte
by an inspector employed and paid by
the city. Councilman Kellogg be
lieves the same. In their opinion it
would place more responsibility on
the inspector and make far better
streets.
Raising of Money Discussed.
The matter of raising money for re-
nairing the streets was discussed. Mr.
Klass suggested a tax of $13 on auto
mobiles and $1 on other vehicles.
Doctor Cole replied that the automo
bile owners have already paid for the
streets. A proposal was then maUe
that the contractor should be required
to guarantee the street for a, certain
period.
"Columbia at present has only
about $5,000 a year to be spent In
keeping the city streets in condition,"
said Mr. Kellogg today. "The money
for sweeping the streets, cleaning
sewers, hiring teams for street work
and all -work on the streets is paid
out of this fund. The amount is en
tirely inadequate. The fund should
be about $12,000." Mr. Kellogg also
suggested a bonded indebtedness for
up-keep on the streets or a license
tax on vehicles.
"The repairs on streets are to be
paid for by the property owners,' ac
cording, to George S. Starrett, city at
torney. "The city engineer drafts the
specifications, and the contract says
that no alterations or changes shall
bo made. The contractor cannot hi
asked to do more than fill the specifi
cations, and if the street Breaks down
it is not his fault"
Mnst Lay "Mains First - '
An ordinance -was passed 'last night
requiring that water mains be -laid
in all streets before they were pavetf.
This ordinance was the result of a
petition from N. D. Evans, urging the
City Council to lay -water mains oi
Walnut street before the paving was
done.
Councilman McDonnell, chairman of
the water and light committee, op
posed the plan, saying that water
mains iwere-needed more In tne west
ern part cf the city. He said the
money supply was limited for this
work and the committee should keep
within the appropriation. In the
western part of town, according to
Mr. McDonnell, 165 houses are with
out water and have no way of fighting
fire successfully. The ordinance was
passeli over his objections.
A petition providing for a walk on
the north side of Conley avenue, be
tween Fifth and Sixth streets, was
heard, and the walk ordered put in.
Discussion of , the sewer district
near Amelia street and Mount Vernon
avenue came up again last night A
new sewer district to be known as
No. 43 was created in the plan sub
mitted by the city engineer and street
committee.
A. B, Lyon protested against the
new district, claiming few persons
would be benefitted. "Most of the
persons there have private sewers and
the creating of a new district would
put a double expense on them," said
Mr. Lyon.
Councllmen Shaw and Reed were In

G. B. Rollins, Curtis B. Rollins, E. T.
Rollins, Frank Thilly, John M. Bur
nam, John D. Lawson, H. T. Cory,
Leo Welner, W. G. Manly, J. P. Blan
ton, D. T. Gentry and FCHicks. The
charter was issued to the club, the
decree of court made and articles re
corded March 13, 1895.
Of the charter members several
have left Columbia. Leo, Werner is a
professor- of Semitic languages in
Harvard. J. P. Blanton, then pro
fessor of pedagogics in the Univer
sity; .is dead. Frank Thilly is pro
fessor of philosophy and dean of the
college at Cornell. H. T. Corey, who
was a professor in engineering, is now
a consulting engineer in California.
John M. Burnam is a professor of
Latin -in the University of Cincinnati.
"The University Club was formed
as a place of meeting between the
town and gown," Curtis B. Rollins,
one of the charter members said, "It
has answered its purpose well.'
The First Presidents.
The first four presidents of the
University Club were: John D. Law
son, Curtis B . Rollins, Dr. Paul
Schweitzer, after whom Schweitzer
Hall is named, and Dr. Raymond
Weeks, who is now a professor of ro

ship committee of E. T. Rollins, John
D. Lawson, Curtis B. Rollins, Sanford
F. Conley and F. W. NIedemeyer was
appointed and secured 100 life mem
berships at $30 each.4 The money was
us;d to furnish the club.
In their twenty-one years of exist
ence, the University and Columbia
Clubs have taken in only two hono
rary members, both famous men of
Missouri. Thye were Samuel L. Clem
ens ("Mark Twain") and Col. Wil
liam F. Switzler, whose name the
building occupied by the School of
Journalism bears. Curtis B. Rollins
has the letter of acceptance from
"Mark Twain." It is written in his us
ual humorous vein and accepts the
kindness of the club "back in my
home state of Missouri." The club

FAVORS TRADE WEEK
V. B. Jones, Retail Merchant
Secretary, Speaks a
- Good Word.-3- '
"I think that Trade Week is one
of the very best ideas for bringing
more persons to Columbia that we
have ever had and I think every mem
ber of the Columbia Commercial Club
whether he is in a retail business or
not, is going to do everything In his
power to make the event a success."
This was the statement of Victor
Jones, secretary of the Columbia Com
mercial Club "esterday.
The special issue of the Missourian
carrying the announcements of the
Columbia merchants who are partici
pating in the event, will be distribut
ed the last of the week. It will go to
more than 5,000 families in the trade
territory. The distribution on the ru
ral routes wllljbe by mail and by spe
cial messengers in the smaller towns
of the county. In addition the special'
announcements will go to the large
list of farmers in Boone and surround
ing counties -who receive the weekly
Herald-Statesman. This is thrown In
a's good measure and will assist great
ly in advertising the sale in the rural
sections of the county and neighbor
ing counties.
The fact that the Women's Civic
League will co-operate to make vis
iting women comfortable and the
further fact that the Athletic De
partment of the University will co
operate with the merchants in encour
aging attendance of Boone County
people at the Tiger-Washington foot
ball game Saurday, October 14, has
done much to create interest in the
Trade Week Festival.
Readers of the Missourian are urged
to preserve the accompanying list of
leading' Columbia merchants for they
are the only ones who will return rail-.
road fares during Trade Week from
October 9 to 14 inclusive.
