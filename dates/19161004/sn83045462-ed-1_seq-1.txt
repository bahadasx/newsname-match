ENTRAINING TODAY
Third Infantry and Sanitary.
Corps Leave Rosslyn at
* 5 Five O'Clock.
HAVE BEEN AT FORT MYER
EXACTLY FIFTEEN WEEKS
Troops to Travel in Forty-Nine Cars,
Banning in Three Sections, at
Fifteen-Minute Intervals.
The 3d Infantry, National
Guard of the District of Columbia?fifty
officers and 967 enlisted
men?and four officers and twentyfour
enlisted men of the sanitary
corps, are entraining at Rosslyn ,
this afternoon for Fort Sam
Houston, San Antonio, Tex., to
which destination Troop A of
Cavalry is preceding them.
The 3d Infantry goes in three sections
of forty-nine cars, the first of which is
due to start at 5 o'clock, and officers in
charge of the work say they expect the
start will be made promptly on time,
and that the two other sections will
pull out at fifteen-minute Intervals.
* It is just fifteen weeks to a day and
almost to an hour from the time the
District troops went into the mobilization
camp at Fort Myer to the time of
their entrainment. They went into
camp at 3:30 p.m.
The first two sections pulling out today
are each made up of seven tourist
sleepers, dne baggage car, three flat
cars, four box cars and one standard
Pullman for the officers. The third section
is made up of eight tourist sleepers,
one stock car, one baggage car,
four box cars, two flat cars and one
standard Pullman for officers.
How the Troops Entrain.
The distribution of soldiers in these
sections is as follows:
First section, sixteen cars?First Battalion
and Machine Gun. Company, Maj.

with the third section. A detail
of one orderly to each horse will look !
after them during the trip. First Sergt.
George Hosmer is in charge of this
detail.
Band Goes'in Second Section.
The regimental band goes in the second
section and the regimental officers
in the last section closing the troop
train.
This train proceeds by the Chesapeake
and Ohio railway to Louisville,
by the Illinois Central to Memphis, by )
the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and
Southern to Texarkana, thence to San
Antonio.
a#
enlisted men will be forwarded by the
railroad companies to the nearest point '
at which the train can be intercepted.
^ In anticipation of a big crowd to see
the soldier boys off, many relatives
and friends went early this afternoon
to the railroad yard at Rosslyn to
spend a last hour with their boys before
they were assigned to their places j
in the train. Nearly every visitor t
brought a box or bag of fruit, candy j
or other delicacies.
The 3d Infantry, headed by the band, !
marched from the deserted camp in
which they have lived for fifteen weeks, j
leaving the camp about 3 o'clock. Many
wives, sweethearts, mothers and others
anticipated the hour of departure and :
spent much of the day at the camp.
Most of those visiting the camp today
carried cameras, and hundreds of
last day pictures were taken.
The welcome and important event of
being "paid off" occupied three hours,
starting at 11 o'clock at the tent of
Capt. Horace P. Hobbs. U. S. A., the
mustering officer, and continuing until
after 2 p.m. The men had their last
meal in the form of a picnic dinner,
being served regular army rations
from the post.
Load Equipment on Trains.
Despite the fact that practically all
of the tentage was struck yesterday
and that most of the heavy camp equip*
ment was packed away, this was the
busiest day of any spent in carnp. MaJ.
John C- Whitaker, the camp quarter- ;
master, was directing the work of getting
all supplies and equipment aboard
?v ? ? >? v.. V....V emu nun proper rec- i
ords checked up for the government. j
He had five five-ton motor trucks and)
seven teams at work carting the prop- ;
erty from the camp to the Kosslyn !
yards, where details from the various
companies were packing them away in i
the cars as fast as they were checked
up by property clerks.
The work of provisioning the train !
for the trip was in. itself a big task,!
as more than twenty tons of food, cost- j
ing more than $6,000, had to be put i
aboard in the best possible condition. !
The magnitude of this work will be!
seen lrom a few figures. Included in j
the supplies were 5,000 pounds of beef,
5,000 pounds of potatoes. 3,000 pounds
of bacon, 2,000 pounds of canned tomatoes.
2,000 pounds of corned beef,
1,500 pounds of onions, 5,000 pounds of
field bread made with a thick crust
to retain as much moisture as possible,
200 pounds of rice, 600 pounds of
sugar, 200 pounds of salt, 600 pounds
of coffee, 400 pounds of butter, prunes,
apples, peaches and many other supplies
in correspondingly large quantities.
Ten-day rations have been provided
by MaJ- Whitaker. in order that there
may be sufficient food for the men in
case of any tie-up on the road. It is
expected, however, that these rations
will last for five days after the men

Guard and Stenographers Go.
ON BOARD PRESIDENT WILSON1 if
SPECIAL TRAIN. PITTSBURGH. October
4. ? President Wilson passed
through here early today, en route to
Omaha, for the first middle western
speech of his campaign.
No prolonged stops were planned before
his arrival at Chicago tonight. He
will speak in Omaha tomorrow night.
In spite of persistent attempts on the
part of democratic leaders to have the
President deliver a number of rear platform
speeches on the way to Omaha, he
absolutely refused to make any such
plans. The President took the position
that he will not make a stumping tour
to aid his campaign. He passed through
several states where he has been urged
to speak, but persisted in' his determination
not to make a political "swing."
v Non-Partisan Speech.
If the President's present plans are
:arried out his Omaha speech, like
those to be delivered later in Indianapolis,
Chicago, Cincinnati and New
fork, will not be partisan. All unloubtedly
will deal with subjects of a
political character.
Mr. Wilson is making the trip to Chicago
on a special train. For the remainder
of the journey his private car
will be attached to a regular train. In
his party are Mrs. Wilson, Secretary
Tumulty, Dr. Cary T. Grayson, the
White House physician, and a corps of
secret service men and stenographers.
Mr. Wilson remained at work until
ate last night, replying to correspondence.
Warm Welcome at Alliance.
ALLIANCE, Ohio, October 4.?Presilent

of his private car.
"We are for you. Wood row!" shouted

vas so brief that Mr. Wilson could
lot even shake hands, but at Alliance
l stay of more than five minutes was
nade, and the President was kept busy
ill that time greeting as many people
is possible. Although he would not

COUNT VON BERNSTORFF
TO CALL ON PRESIDENT
Expected to Present Personal Letter
From Kaiser Regarding Proposed
Relief for Poland.
LONG' BRANCH, N. J., October 4.?
Count von Bernstorff, German ambassador
to the United States, will call on
President Wilson at Shadow Lawn next
Monday.
It is understood the ambassador will
present to Mr. Wilson a personal letter
from the German emperor, replying to
autograph messages sent by the President
to the rulers of several European
nations, urging that a method be Agreed
upon for getting relief supplies to starving
people in Poland. It has been re
ported that the German reply does not
tend to bring about an agreement.
The entente allies have taken the position
that they will allow the shipment of
supplies to Poland if food already there
is not shipped out nor utilized by German
and Austrian troops. This position
has not met with favor from the German
and Austro-Hungarian governments.
The contemplated vjfit of Count von
BernstorfT revived reports of possible
moves for peace in Europe, or of a resumption
of Germany's submarine warfare.
Ambassador Gerard now is on his
way home from Berlin. So far as it has
been established, however, the call of the
German ambassador at Shadow Lawn has
no connection with either of those reports.

COMER REMOVAL
DFTROLLEYPOLES
D. C. Commissioners May
Order Them Down on Bladensburg
Road.
STEP IS CONTEMPLATED
TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS
?
Col. Ifnte Rftvs Conditions Maka for
Repetition There of Fatalities
of Monday Night.
Removal
of the trolley poles
from Bladensburg road so as to
eliminate the possibility of an accident
such as caused the death
Monday night of William M.
Schaffer, when an automobile in
which he was driving collided
with pole 146 at the intersection
of Bladensburg road and 28th
street, will probably be ordered
by the District Commissioners.
Engineer Commissioner Kutz today
said that the condition created by the
existence of these poles in Bladensburg
road and particularly at 28th street,
where the poles shift from the west to
the east side of the car tracks, is undoubtedly
a dangerous one; that they
should be removed and that an investigation
to determine what steps should
be taken to improve the situation
would be made-at once.
The Commissioner said if Bladensburg
road were provided with double
car tracks there would be no objection
to the poles occupying space between
the tracks, but that with the present
singie-tracK construction the only safe
place for the poles is along the curb
lines. Col. Kutz said that he intended
taking the matter up at once with the
other members of the board, and that a
plan for remedying the situation would
be worked out with the least possible
delay.
Holds Inquest This Afternoon.
Coroner Nevitt this afternoon is holding
an inquest at the morgue to have
a jury pass upon the death of William
M. Schaffer, 501 13th street, who
was killed yesterday morning when
an automobile in which he was rid'ng
struck a trolley pole near Bladensburg
road and 28th street. Several persons
involved in the accident and others will
be examined, and Police Photographer
Sandberg will present a photograph of
me scene or me accident and tell of
measurements he made. His measurements
show that the pole which was
struck by the automobile is located
three feet west of the car tracks, while
the distance from the pole to the side
i of the roatd is sixteen feet.
Just what view the jury will take
of the affair will be told in their verdict.
Photographer Sand berg's picture
of the scene will give them a definite
idea of the conditions existing on the
road that have been characterized as
being dangerous, and occupants of the
cars of Arthur C. Smith, in which
Schaffer was riding, and that of Jesse
Mann, which was overturned, will explain
what happened just prior to the
time of the accident and tell how the
car happened to strike the trolley pole.
As long ago as the middle of April
of this year the attention of the Commissioners
was called to the alleged
dangerous condition on Bladensburg
road resulting from the location of the
trolley poles near the car tracks. Their
attention was called to the condition of
the road in a communication signed
"A Friend of Safety First," "safety
first" being heavily underscored.
Accident on Road In April.
A clipping from The Evening Star of
April 27, giving an account of an accident
that happened at Bladensburg and
Mount Olivet roads, in which the automobile
of Edward G. Fisher struck a
trolley pole and injured Edward Flaherty,
was inclosed. The note to the Commissioners
reads:
"Don't you think your board, knowing
the many accidents that have been
caused by the poles on Bladensburg
road, should take immediate action and
have them removed? Any deaths caused
by these poles will certainly be laid to
your hands."
The "friend of safety first" letter
was turned over to Maj. Pullman, superintendent
of police, for investigation
and report, and Capt. Henry
Schneider of the ninth precinct made
the investigation. The captain reported:
"The conditions on the Bladensburg
road are bad in so far |ls vehicular
traffic is concerned. The roadbed
of the street railway is in bad condition,
and the poles In the center of the
road form a very dangerous and. In my
opinion, unlawful obstruction that
should be removed as soon as possible.
"Steps should be taken at once to
compel the railroad company to make
su?h repairs to the space between the
tracks and adjacent thereto as re
quired by law."
Capt. Schneider's report was submitted
to Maj. Pullman and was transmitted
by him to the engineer department,
that department calling the matter to
the attention of the Washington Hailway
and Electric Company.
Explanation of the Report.
In explanation of Capt. Schneider's
report on the conditions on the road, it
is stated by the report made shortly afterward
by the engineer of highways
that the trolley poles on the center line
of the Bladensburg road were placed on
this line when the existing railway track
was laid at the request of the railway
company and on account of the fact
that there was already one line of poles
on the side of the road, which would
interfere to some extent with side-pole
construction. It was then thought that
the road would be double tracked at
I an early date, which would remove the
objection to center line poles.
"Upon its own initiative the railway
company had removed the center line
poles and installed side pole construction
from H street to a point near the
north line of the Mount Olivet cemetery,"
the report states. "This was
done at a time when a number of poles
needed renewing. It is believed that
unless the company intends at an early
date to double-track its lines, of which
there is at present no indication, it
should be required to replace any defective
poles with side-pole construction
when such replacement is required.
"The attention of the company oper,
ating this line was called to this condition
on April 5. On May 23 the engineer
of way replied, stating that a
small amount of work had been done
and that the improvements will be
continued. Their attention will again
be called to this repair."
Company May Spend $16,500.
In iwpobm to communication, from
the Dlatrlet authorities, C. 8. Kimball,
T>
'k\
1
r'
T
engineer of way and structures, Washington
Railway and Electric Company,
wrote Capt. Loving that the railway
company had been renewing ties and
surfacing the tracks on the Maryland
end of'the line, and stated that he had
requested authority to spend $16,500
within the District of Columbia on that
particular lirie during the two years
following the date of the letter, July
IS, 1916.
He wrote that he fully expected his
request to make 'the expenditure would
be approved, after which he would proceed
to remedy the conditions and perform
work that would meet the approval
of the District engineer department.
concluding: "We trust that you
will Indulge with us in this matter until
our proposed expenditures are approved,
after which we will proceed
immediately to make permanent repairs."
Under date of July 26, Capt. Schneider
wrote Maj. Pullman: "Attention is
again invited to the very dangerous
conditions existing between the car
tracks on Bladensburg road north of
Levis street .to the District of Columbia
line. In some places the space between
the tracks is washed out about
ten inches deep. In my judgment a
case of fatal accident resulting from
this dangerous condition would lay
those responsible liable to criminal
action."
INSURANCE MEN HELD

Taken to Jail.
Samuel J. Masters and John B. Kin

insurance Company of the District of
Columbia, were formally adjudged today
by Justice Siddons of the District
Supreme Court to be in contempt of
court for faiMng to turn over certain
assets of the insurance company to its
receiver, H. Winship Wheatley.
The court directed the United States
marshal to take the men into custody
arid to detain them at the Washington
Asylum and jail until they or either of
them shall have complied with the provisions
and requirements of the decree
of August 2. 1916.
Through Attorney D. W. Baker, the
men noted an appeal from the contempt
decree and furnished a supersedeas
bond of $25,000. The bond will
have the effect, it is said, of suspending
the direction to the marshal and
the incarceration of the men until the
appellate court acts on the appeal.
Attorney William Henry White conducted
the contempt proceedings on
behalf of the receiver.

HE RECONCILIATION ERA
CHANCELLOR'SFOES
ARE MOREIN OPEN
Retirement Is Demanded in
Circular Sent to Members
of Reichstag.
BERLIN. October 3, via London; October
4.?-The campaign against Chan- j
cellor von Bethmann-Hollweg is daily;
assuming a more tangible form. One
of the latest developments Is a circular
demanding the retirement of the chancellor,
which has been sent by a vociferous
group of his opponents to such
members of the reichstag as are considered
open to their arguments.
The indictment covers almost everything
in the chancellor's conduct of
foreign affairs before and duHng the
war. Attacks are made in particular
on his attempts to reach an agreement
with England, his first attitude toward
Belgium neutrality and, naturally, his
policy in the submarine issue. The
only name of International prominence
among the signers is that of Ernst
Haeckel, and the circular is regarded
as symptomatic rather than serious.
Political Truce Is Broken.
Another factor which is disturbing
the political situation is a breach of
the political truce, proclaimed at the
outset of the war, which has been .made
by the Saxon socialists. This faction
has determined to run a candidate for
the seat in the reichstag vacated by
J he. death of the conservative Ernst
. Educard Giese. This determination vioj
mies the general agreement between
the political parties that all vacant
seats shall be resigned without contest
to the party holding them at the outset
of the war.
Meanwhile the chancellor and the
reichstag leaders continue to discuss
the points at issue behind closed doors.
The discussion is being conducted on
an even more confidential basis than
before. It Is being no longer held before
the full committee on ways and
means, to which all members of the
I .Alotiatar or? nHmlH.H a? oK?f
in a smaller, select committee of party
leaders, who are specially bound to
shcrecy. Such reports as leak out say
that while the antagonism between the
chancellor and. his opponents has not
disappeared, the discussion Is now
being conducted on the basis of reason
and not of passion.
It is believed that there Is a good
prospect that an agreement will be
reached which will avoid the open discussion
of issues before the reichstag.
The friends of the chancellor appear to
be fully satisfied with the situation,
and declare that he has It well In hand.
Kings Refuse to Aid.
AMSTERDAM, via London, October
4.?The Berlin Tageblatt announces the
failure of "a scheme hatched by the
opponents of the imperial chancellor
to induce the kings of Bavaria and
Wurttemberg to sign a petition expressing
indirect hostility to his policy."
?
The Munich committee formed to
agitate in favor of a more ruthless
warfare against England, the papers
say, attempted to bring southern
Germany into a state of agitation
against Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg on
the ground that he was too sparing of
England. The attempt to place the two
kings at the head of the movement
failed. _

NEW YORK, October 4.?The rising
cost of food was impressed upon thousands
of citizens today by the action j
of the largest dairy restaurant here in 1

which owns a chain of lunchrooms in j
New York and other cities, added 5 t
cents to the prices of all the staple i
dishes. t
Hacn and eirgs and ham and eggs c
now cost SO cents instead of 25 cents; a i

higher, no matter how prepared. <.
All pies from now on are 10 cents a
cut, but instead of seven cuts to the f
pie there will be six. In the past only j
the fresh fruit pies, such as peach and ,
berry, were sold on the six-cut. ten- 11
ceht basis. n
The wholesale price of sugar advanced
from 6% cents to 7 cents a

7 to 8 cents. The increased demand
resulting from the war was given as ?
the reason, although it was asserted "

and Thiepval, and proceeds:
"These victories brought our front
line at more than one point within a;
mile of the German fourth position j
west of the Bapaume-Transley road."
The statement continues:
"The enemy has fought stubbornly
to check our advance, and since September
15 seven new divisions have
been brought against us and five
against the French. The severe and
prolonged struggle demanded on the
part of our troops very great determination
and courage.
At End of September.
"At the end of Septeiftber the situation
may be summarised as follow*;
Since the opening of the battle, July 1,
we have taken 26,735 prisoners and engaged
thirty-eight German divisions,
of which twenty-nine (about 350,000
men) have been withdrawn exhausted
or broken. We hold the half-moon upland
9outh of the' Ancre, occupy every
height of importance and so have direct
observation ground to the east and
northeast. The enemy has fallen back
upon a fourth line behind a low ridge
just west of the Bapaume-Transloy
road.
"The importance of the three months'
offensive is not to be judged by the
distance advanced or the number of
enemy trench lines taken. It must be
looked for in the effect upon the enemy's
strength in numbers, material
and morale. The enemy has used up
his reserves in repeated, costly and unsuccessful
counter attacks without
causing our allies or ourselves to relax
our steady, methodical pressure.
Praise for Fighting Men.
"In this action the representative*
from every part of the British empire
wid British Islands have been engaged.
A.11 behaved with the discipline and
resolution of veterans.
"Our aircraft have shown in the
lighest degree the spirit of the offensive.
They have patrolled regularly
aehind the enemy's lines, and have
bought many battles in the air with
loetile machines and many with enemy
:roops on the ground. For every enemy
nachlne that succeeds in crossing our
!ront it is safe to say that two hunired
British machines cross the enemy's
:ront."

4:20 p.m.?The Rumanian
forces which crossed the Danube
river between the Danube fortresses
of Rustchuk and Turtukai
have withdrawn hastily, says the
official statement issued today by
the German army headquarters,
as the result of encircling movements
put into operation by
Field Marshal von Mackensen, the
commander of the forces of the
central powers and their allies in
Dobrudja.
A Mystery to London.
LONDON. October 3?Mystery still
surrounds the numbers and movements
of the Rumanian forces which
have crossed the Danube into Bulgaria,
near Rahovo, in an evident effort
to outflank the Bulgarian left
wing and compel hte retreat of Field
Marshal von Mackensen from the line
south of the Constansa-Tchernavoda
railway.
Sofia in its current announcement
mentions these forces as comprising
"c<fhsiderable units,** but records no
contact between them and their Bulgarian
foe.
Reports Invaders Cut Off.
Berlin's assertion that the pontoon
bridge on which the Rumanians
crossed was destroyed is supplemented
by Sofia's statement that the bridge
was put out of commission "at the
Dobrudja side" by Austrian monitors.
What dispositions the Rumanians are
making to keep up the communications,of
this force are not known. Bucharest
has not alluded to the movement in its
official statements.
| On their part the Bulgarians apparently
are either engaged in frustrating
another Rumanian movement to cross
the Danube, or are attempting an
operation of this sort on their own account.
They report the occupation by
their troops of the Island of M&kakalafat,
opposite Vidin. in the extreme
northwesterly part of Bulgaria, and the
dispersal by Bulgarian artillery of Rumanian
forces on the other side of the
river.
