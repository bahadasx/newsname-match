NORTH DAKOTA
FIRST FAMILIES
HIGH LIVERS
Old Strikes Two and Mrs.
Red Tail Win Prizes at
Unique Show.
Bismarck, N. D., Oct. 4.—If you
seek familiarity with the daily bill of
fare which prevailed in North Dako
ta in the year 916 you will be inter
ested in a collection of edibles of 1,
000 years ago which Dr. M. R. Gil
more, curator of the state historical
museum, brought back with him from
the annual fair of the Fort Berthold
reservation at Elbowwoods.
This exposition was attended by
descendants of the very first families
of North Dakota—the Mandans, Hl
dat8us and the Arickaras—descend
ants of those same kindly natives
who more than a hundred years ago
sheltered Lewis and Clark through a
long winter and in' the spring sped
them westward, with ample provi
sions and a guide.
Always Were Farmers.
The members of these three tribes,
who have lived together in harmony
in the plains country of the Missouri
for hundreds of years, have always
been able husbandmen. They have
done much to aid in the domestica
tion of corn, beans, squashes and oth
er vegetables brought north from
Mexico, and their exhibits at the re
cent fair prove that they are no less
skilled in modern agronomy.
An unusual display of ofd-time, ab
original products was brought out by
special prizes offered by Dr. Gil more.
Among the exhibits are three varieties
of flour corn—the white, yellow and
red, which have been cultivated on
the slopes of the Missouri for prob
ably a thousand years.
An interesting exhibit consists of a
box manufactured by Mrs. Red Tail,
an Arlckara, which shows six varie
ties of the old-time beans introduced
here from Mexico, and grown by the
Arickaras for hundreds of years dry
corn, roasted on the ear, in the husk,
and allowed to steam in its own juic
es, producing the sweetest of all dried
seeds dried June berries, dried choke
cherries pounded into a pulp and
formed into cakes, and dried tipsin
roots, used when fresh as potatoes
and when dried pounded into flour.
Old Custer Scout Won frrlze.
Strikes Two, one of Custer's most
faithful Arlckara scouts, carried off a
special prize with an entry of an an
cient Arlckara variety of bean, called
from its appearan9e "Quails Head,"
which was entirely new to Dr. Gil
more, In spite of the fact that the lat
ter's researches have extended over
all the plains country. Another prize
entry,.of Strfkes Ttvo's was a specimen
of native Arlckara tobacco, cured as
according torr oufrtom In -the entire
plant, which will be carefully pre
served in -the, museum cases. In addi
tion to the plant,' Strikes Two present
ed Dr. Gilmore with a sample of the
blossoms and seeds, which are picked
and cures separately. The tobacco
grows In bush form, with small
leaves, cures green and has small re
semblance to its modern descendant.
Of a decidedly appetizing odor, al
though not tempting to the eye, is a
cake made by separately parching
corn, beans and sun-flower seed,
grinding them to a powder and mold
ing. The sunflower seed, which is the
only genuine native of the lot, the
•ther ingredients being of Mexican
descent, furnishes enough oil to blend
the corn and' the beans. It is a food
which is easily preserved, compact
and easily transported, and was much
used on marches.
Some Ancient Pottery.
Mrs. Red Tail, said to be the last
potter on the reservation, sold to Dr.
Gilmore a small vessel, slightly larger
than a tea-cup, which she had molded
and baked. Although nicely shaped,
the little jug is the color of lignite
coal, being composed of dark clays
with pounded rock to provide the
necessary fusing qualities.

"The binder twine situation is in
the control of the Commission del
Mercado de Hemequin Ruguladore of
Yucatan," the congressman said. "This
is tho most iron-clad trust in the
world, and controls absolutely the
world's supply of sisal, out of which
binder twine is made.
"This trust was organized by the
military governor of Yucatan, who
controls it, and was financed in the
United States with the approval of the
state department.
"Norman Lind, whose father, John
Lind, was sent as President Wilson's
personal representative to Mexico to
oust Huerta, is its American repre
sentative.
"This trust already has doubled the
price,,.of sisal to Minnesota and the
Dakotas by raising it from 3 1-2 cents
to"7 cents:per pound, arid. no.w refuses
to quote prices for next year lower
than 10 centli per pound.
"On the basis of the amount of
twine used annually this means an
extra tax of at least 10 cents per acre."

faction is determined to run a can

HOOD PERU
Of RED RIVER
DUE TO DRAINS
Upper River Investigated by
Commission Which
Fixes Blame.
Fargo. N. D., Oct. 4.—Further com
plications for the constantly increas
ing flood peril in the Red river valley
are brought to light by a commission
which has just concluded an 800-mile
automobile tour of the district drain
ed by the Red river, and who see in
the rapid advance of drainage opera
tions peril greater than has previous
ly prevailed.
In Richland county, with over forty
drain ditches constructed in the last
five years Wilkin. Clay and Traverse
counties, in Minnesota, with nearly
100 more drain ditches constructed
during the same period, and with Cass
county, in North Dakota, construct
ing many new drains in recent years
and authorizing $250,000 more worth
of work, the survey commission sees
the creation of a condition that must
receive the joint attention of the states
of North Dakota. Minnesota and
South Dakota, as well as the aid of
the federal government.
Water which under the old system
did not reach the Red river for from
forty-eight hours to a week after a
rainfall, is now dumped into the
stream within a very short time of a
rain and the channel is not great
enough to carry off the surplus water.
Lake Source Larger.
Traverse lake, in which the Red
river rises, ordinarily a body of water
about eighteen miles long and from a
few feet to a half mile wide, is today
three to four miles wide and much
higher.
The town of White Rock, S. D., is
completely marooned, and the place is
reached by a narrow causeway com
pletely surrounded by flood "waters.
Every building in the town is sur
rounded by water: the sidewalks are
just a few inches above the water line.
One resident said he had not been
able to cross the back yard of his
place throughout the summer because
of the high water.
"The Red river district faces seri
ous flood conditions unless remedial
steps are taken immediately," said H.
W. Geary. Jr., a member of the com
mittee. "The farmers and business
men throughout the district are talk
ing and working for additional drain
age projects, and each new drain sim
ply adds to the flood dangers.
Need Concerted Action.
"Concerted action is essential if we
are to avoid a repetition of the floods
of this season."
The six new drain projects author
ized in Cass county today will pro
videwdrainaga- In. the. so-called Daven
port district. All told, 100,000 acres
will be drained the drains will cost
about $250,000 and are forty-two
miles long.
TOBACCO GROWERS GET
LITTLE Of THE PROFITS
Society of Equity President Says
Growers of Kentucky Are De
nied Just Profits.
Tobacco growers of the south, par
ticularly of Kentucky, are getting but
a small percentage of the actual value
of their produce, according to the
statement of M. P. Johnson, president
of the North Dakota Society of Equity
who passed through Grand Forks
over the Great Northern last night.
Mr. Johnson spent nine weeks in
Kentucky in organization work in the
hope of creating better market con
ditions.
It is a revival of the old question
of grading, of fixing the price of the
commodity at which the farmer must
sell, and the producer has no voice
irf determining either the price or the
grade. No state regulations of any
kind govern either marketing or
grading.
Mr. Johnson stated that the present
price received by the producer is only
about 25 per cent of what it should
be. In an attempt to remedy the
situation, the Society of Equity is ad
vocating collective bargaining." Just as
the fruit growers of the west have
combined, in order to secure just re
turns.

ers Will Not Suffer by Damage to
Their Grain.
Winnipeg, Oct. 4.—The Judgment
of experienced observers that the pre
vailing high prices for grain are com
pensating for this season's crop short
age is borne out in the monthly report
on crop and business condition, is re
ported by John H. Rich, federal re
serve agent.
"Old crop wheat and what has been
marketed of the new crop, has com
manded very unusual prices," the re
port says, "and the market price for
practically everything else the farmer
has to sell at this season, is likewise
high."
The report on flax and corn yields
and quality is particularly encourag
ing although, it is noted, the damage
to the wheat crop was not over-esti
mated.
The hay crop throughout the dis
trict is unusually heavy and of good
quality, while clover and alfalfa have
yielded well and there is an abund
ance of feed, an important matter In
view of the farmers' tendency to in
crease their live stock herds.
