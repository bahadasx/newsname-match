Vermont Troops Home and Mustered Out
The First Vermont Infantry which
was mustered into service in the Unit
ed States army for border service last
soring and has seen three months'
service at Eagle Pass, Texas, arrived
in Vermont Wednesday morning of last
week and are in camp at Fort Ethan
Allen. The men are not to be mus
tered out but as Col. Reeves, comman
der, expressed it, are to be given a
long leave of absence but are at the
call of the federal government when
ever it has need of them. Governor
Gates visited the camp Friday and a
review was planned but the steady
rain made it necessary to call the re
view off, but Governor Gates visited
each company barracks. The work of
checking up all government property
is a huge task, but as soon as this is
done and the men can be paid they will
be released.

PIERCE FARM BUILDINGS BURNED.
The farm buildings of Charles Pierce
located on the Westmore road near the
outlet of Willoughby lake were totally
destroyed by fire Tuesday forenoon.
The fire was discovered about eleven
o'clock and had gained such headway
that it was impossible to save any of
the contents of the barn and only a
little furniture in the house. All the
hay, 150 bushels of grain, farming
tools, three registered calves, several
hogs, one horse and an automobile
were burned. The origin of the fire is
not known but it is thought it might
possibly have caught from a live wire
in the engine room where electricity
was generated for lighting the build
ings. This set of buildings was one of
the best in this vicinity and it is a
great loss to the town. The loss is
partially covered by insurance.

BROWNINGTON
. Burlington, Vt, Sept. 27, 1916.
Mr. Editor:
In view of the rumor that H. A.
Bashaw, manager of my farm in
Brownington, has been discharged on
account of incompetency, I wish to
state that this is not the fact Mr.
Bashaw has left my employ purely on
account of his health, which has made
it impossible for him to continue the
farm work. In justice to Mr. Bashaw,
who has been a faithful and conscien
tious employee, I would like very much
to have this rumor corrected ; and if it
is not inconsistent with your poilcy,
f would appreciate it if such part of
thid letter as you may think best.
could be published.
I am,
Very truly yours.
Dr. H. C. Tinkham.

Barton Academy and
Graded School
THE ATHLETIC SITUATION.
Any school which has ever been rep
resented by strong athletic teams
wants them again. Barton academy
has had them, and with the present
enthusiasm will have them again with
in a short time. The school would like
to see every boy trying for a place on
its teams, but that is the ideal condi
tion, and we cannot expect it. But
during the last two weeks over half the
boys have been regular in attending
the fall baseball practice, and these
afternoons on the diamond have been
long and hard. Under such conditions
it is natural that the squad should
show improvement, but in many cases
this improvement has been little less
than remarkable. With a large num
ber of veterans under the capable lead
ership of Wallace Abbott, the .team
should bring much credit to itself and
to the school in the spring. Battery
practice will be held in the cage during
the winter months, and particular at
tention will be directed toward devel
oping pitching material from the un
der classes. After the fall baseball
practice, basket ball will be introduced
with the intention of making it a rec
ognized sport of the school. If enough
candidates appear, class teams will be
picked and from them we hope to ob
tain material for a good team. The
game has not been played in Barton
recently, every boy will enter the
squad on an equal footing; so at least
twenty candidates should report every
afternoon. If the same enthusiasm,
the same willingness, which has dom
inated the baseball "workouts, " mani
fests itst-lf, the school should be proud
of, and Barton intensely interested in,
its basketball team.
THE ANNUAL CORN ROAST.
The annual corn roast at Wakeman's,
the first social event of the school year,
took place on Monday evening. Sept.
25, at 7.30 o'clock. In spite of the fact
that it had rained during the after
noon, leaving everything rather damp,
the evening was quite warm and pleas
ant and everyone arrived, with more or
less difficulty, at the fire which was on
a hill above the house. There was a
plentiful supply of corn and apples,
which 7vere roasted, or rather burned,
by the freshman boys, for the rest of
the academy. After everyone had eat
en all they cared for, the young men
of the class of 1920 were subjected to
a iittle ordeal to make them true and
loyal members of our illustrious acad
emy. A generous coating of black
from the embers was applied to their
faces, their heads were covered with
molasses from a bottle, thoughtfully
brought by the older boys, and the
"Freshies" were requested to make
speeches, sing songs and do dances,
both alone and in unison, for the
amusement of the students and teach
ers. Many of the demonstrations did
credit to the class and everyone was
sorry when they were over, but when
the fire had burned down, the boys and
girls gave the academy yll which was
followed by the freshmen with their
yell and then everyone started home
ward, a more or less difficult journey
since the night was very dark and the
pasture rough, but everyone was in
high spirits and admitted the usual
good time at this affair. The members
of the academy are very grateful for
the fun, which is always to be bad at
these roasts given every year by Mr.
Wakeman.
