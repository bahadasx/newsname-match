H. N. Pope, of President's Associa
tion, Advocates I/oun Plan.
Fort Worth, Texas. Oct. 1.-Henry
N. Pope, president of the Farmers'
Union State Presidents' Association,
nas submitted to all Southern mem
bers of Congress the suggestion that
Congress fix or empower the Federal
Reserve Hoard to tlx a minimum
loan price of 12 cents per pound on
cotton for all crops. A large major
ity of the replies from Senators and
Representatives favor the plan and
Mr. Pope tasted to-day that he would
call a special meeting of his associa
tion in New Orleans at an early date
to give it final consideration and
work out the de i 11s.
Many members of Congress have
expressed their willingness to give
the movement their co-operation.
President Pope states that there
should be a careful distinction be
tweon the loan minimum and the
selling minimum of cotton. "The
loan minimum should be protected by
the government," he said, "and cot
ton would of course never be sold be
low that point. The selling minimum
is one that the union advises its
members to sell and may vary from
crop to crop or from time to time.
With a protected loan minimum of
12 cents the selling minimum or 20
conts can be more onsily maintained.
The government would never be call
ed upon to put up one cent under this
plan for when a farmer knows he can
borrow 12 cents per pound on cotton
he will never sell unless he can get a
much higher price. Neither could the
consumer be penalized, for the fluc
tuation in the price of cotton haB lit

Fort Myers, Fla., Oct. 2.-Chase
for the four bandits who robbed a
bank at Homestead, Fla., on 'Septem
ber If? of $6,000, ended to-day when
the body of Janies Tucker, one of tho
robbers, wns found in Lopez river,
and Hugh Alderman, who police say
confessed his part of tho crime, sur
rendered. Pucker was drowned
while trying to swim the river.
Tucker's death makes (Ive resulting
from t li o robbery.
During their Hight down tho Flor
ida east coast the bandits had seve
ra' pistol lights with pursuers, and
three possemen were killed. They es
caped from that section, went to Key
West and started up the west coast.
Leland Rice, said to have been the
leader of the band, was shot and kill
ed by a resident of Chokaloskee Is
land September 28 and the next day
Rice's brother, Frank, was shot and
dangerously wounded when he at
tempted to board a schooner near tho
island.
Alderman said to-day that lie and
Tucker tried to swim the river to
gether and that he was ahead. When
In the stream Alderman said he called
back to Tucker and asked if ho
thought he could hold out until he
reached the opposite bank. Tucker
said ho could. That was the last Al
derman said he saw of him. Tucker's
body was found by Charles Tigerta,
an Indian boy.
Alderman got across snfely and
went to a house on Turner's Island
and arrived during the absence of the
Lopez family, the occupants. When
Alfonzo and Joseph Lopez, with H.
T. Whiddon, went to tho house Al
derman called out to them that ho
wished to surrender, fearing he
would be shot If he continued to try
to get away. The threo mon were
brought to Jail here.
Alderman and Tucker had been
two days and nights without food
when death and surrender ended the
pu rsuit.
COTTON CONDITION OX IA" H ALK
Of Normal-Weevil, Caterpillar and
Cool Nights Destructive.
Washington, Oct. 2. - Storms and
insect damage have wrought lia voe
with the cotton crop this year and
cauesd a loss of almost 3,OOO,OOO
bales throughout the growing season.
This year's crop will be approxi
mately 11,037.000 equivalent 500
pound 'bales, according to the De-i
partaient of Agriculture's forecast {
made to-day, basing its estimate on
tho condition of the crop on Septem
ber 2?. In its ilrst forecast of pro
duction made from conditions exist
ing June 2 5 the quantity was estimat
ed at 14,266,000 bales. The condi
tion Of the crop on September 25 was
5 6.3 per cent of a normal, which is
the lowest condition on record for
that time of the year. A report giv
ing its final estimate will be made by
the department on December ll.
Cotton this year was planted on the
fourth largest acreage ever recorded
-36,994,000 acres. In 1911, when
36,0 15.000 acres were planted, the
crop was 15.69S.000 bales; in 1913,
when there were 37,089,000 acres,
the crop was 14,156,000 bales, and in
1014, when the acreage was 36,832,
000, the crop amounted to 16,135,
000 bales.
Indications are that this year's
crop will yield only 156.3 pounds per
acre, compared with 207.7 pounds in
1911, 182 pounds In 10V3 and 200.2
pounds in 1014.
In a statement issued to-day on
conditions existing September 25, the
crop reporting board said:
"There was heavy deterioration in
cotton again this month In the cen
tral cotton States. Boll weevils in
Texas, Arkansas, Alabama. Louisi
ana and Florida have taken away a
heavy toll, puncturing and destroy
ing grown bolls to a larger extent
than ever before known. This Insect
has, in addition, seriously damaged
the crop In portions of Oklahoma,
Georgl.i and Tennessee. Caterpillars
have Injured the late cotton In south
ern Texas and eastern Florida. Cool
nights caused a cessation of fruiting
and the plant shed its fruit consider
ably in the northern portion of the
cotton belt.
"There is considerable late cotton
in thc Carolinas and some in north
ern Georgia which will need a late
killing frost to reach anything like
full maturity.
"The weather during the month
was very favorable for gathering the
crop, and the high prices prevailing
for both cotton.and tho seed caused
the farmers in all parts of the South
to rush gathering and ginning, and
there has been a much larger per
centage of tho crop put through the
gins than usual at this time of the
year. In southern Mississippi and
Alabama, where thc crop is practi
cally a failure, ono picking got the
crop, the average in many counties
being a bale to the mule, or less. Over
the entire cotton belt the crop this
season lias been rapidly picked) and
there is loss cotton remaining in the
fields than usual at this time of the
year. The picking season will aver
age two or three weeks early."

the sick anti wounded can be treated.
Through the efforts of Hrs. J. H.
Johns and W. A. Strickland the Insti

residence of Dr. Burt Mitchell has
been secured for tho location. It is
being thoroughly renovated and re
paired. Hospital fixtures and equip
ment were ordered some time ago,
but have been delayed In transit. The
management hopes to have every
thing in readiness to open in the next
week or so. Nothing will bo left un
done to have an up-to-date hospital,
and we congratulate the promoters
and wish them abundant success and
co-operation in their undertaking.
Patients will have tho vory best at
tention of nurses and surgeons and
we hope the people all over tho coun
ty will remember the hospital at
Westminster when sickness or mis
fortune overtakes them.
Safety Einst--Sow (hain.
We all know that the high water
destroyed most of the corn on river
and crook bottom land this year. No
ono knows what corn will be selling
at next spring. Dut farmers who
plant good crops of oats and othor
small grain will not spend all their
cotton money for corn and hay.
Oats treated for smut and sown in
open furrow at first picking of cot
ton is a pretty euro crop.
