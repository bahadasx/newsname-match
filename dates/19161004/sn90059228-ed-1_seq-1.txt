TESTING ASSOCIATION
i OF MINNESOTA.
This Association was organized in
March with twenty-four members
and a total of 190 cows.
It is the first Association to be
organized in the Red River Valley.
In fact it is the only Association in
Northwestern Minnesota.
Ttfis section of the state has been
noted in the past primarily for its
large farms devoted to grain raising.
At present owing to depleting
soil fertility and the quick possession

of foul weeds, due to this system of
robbing the soil, farmers are beginn

must very soon occupy an important
place in their farming system.
Members of the Association are
snowing a marked interest in im
proving their herds, a number of
*loarder" cows having been sold for
beef.
12 members own pure bred bulls.
6 have barns equipped with mod

We were ordered to pack and
move to Champion Stores" for pa
trolling and guarding service.
Champion Stores is a little coun
itry store owned and run by a Mexi
can. It is about one-half mile from
the new bed of the Rio Grande and
at owe time was a prosperous store,
but now, owing to the trouble across
the river, it has lost trade.
On the first Wednesday in Sept
ember ithe big government trucks
pulled into "D street" and were
loaded with Company goods. Then
the men pilled on and were taken to
the store. It was an eighteen mile
ride, over wet, gumbo roads, but
the trip was made without mishap
and we arrived in our new camp in
two hours and a quarter
The camping grounds we ideal
and \vi+h
the exception of za"'l weeds
were all cleared. However, the
weeds soon disappeared and the
tents raised.
When the5
camp was settled it
looked like a big farm yard. On
one side was the wind-mil and well,
then the tents lined up among the
shade trees, of which there were
many, and on tihe other there was
the corral with the eight mules. A
pretty camp will never be seen in
Texas.
1 There was only one drawback to
the camp and that was the lack of
water, for altho there was a well
and mill yet the well was dry.
While at the "Stores," the Com
pany was excused from drilling and
spent most of their time at "bunk
fatigue," a most satisfying sport.
It consists of sleeping on one's bunk
or bed.
When we reached the "Stores"
we were still sleeping on the
ground, but the government issue of
cots arrived and we are now sleep
ing on cots with real steel springs.
Also we have wool sweaters issued
to us. They come in real handy too,
because the evenings and nights are
nearly always cold here.
We were on guard every other
iiiigltt while A &xe i*iVr cumf"
went patrolling on the river banks
every day, but had no trouble ex
cept from the mosquitoes. They
were really awful. Down here they
grow larger and have stronger
stingers than those in Minnesota,
also they are more numerous and
dangerous. They cause malaria.
Two cases of malaria have brok
en out in Co. D., but I don't believe
we will have any more, because of
the quinine which, all men are e
quired to take each day.
After our three weeks' vacation,
Wv. are back at Llano Grande again,
Lnf
we miss the "fiim imp" and
the "bunk fatigue."
Allison Clark was sick /or a whue
but is better now and is able to drill

An Auto Trip to Foldahl
On Sunday afternoon last ye
editor and his wife, son Edgar and
Mr. and Mrs C. F. Johnson and
daughter Folsom made an auto trip
north east from the city, with no
special destination in view except to
enjoy the beautiful many colored
autumn scenery and the good roads.
Never before have we seen the
"Great Eastern" in better condition.
When reaching the northern part of
Foldahl,, we stopped at a farm house
to find out where we were, when lo
and behold the genial and kindly
face of our old friend Louis Lofgren,
appeared in the doorway. Although
we had nbt intended to stop any
where, we simply could not refuse
the invitation of the kind hearted
and hospitable Mr. Lofgren to come
into the house for a short visit,
which we all enjoyed. Although
Mrs. Lofgren was at the hospital in
Warren receiving medical treatment,
we nevertheless were asked to stay
for Supper, which was prepared by
a Mrs. Mattson, of Newfolden, as
sisted by one of Mr. Lofgren's bright
girls, and to which we did full
justice. Somehow,-autoing with us
always gives us a good appetite.
Mr- Lofgren is a good farmer, and
his rye, corn, oats and potatoes, have
turned out very well, and his wheat
also was fair. A big flock of turkeys
floorsl.was seen in the yard. While we were
at the Lofgrenhome, Miss Elna Erick
son, of Warren, arrived there, to begin
teaching an eight months' term of
school in the district. She had made
gren family. As the sun was sink
ing in the west we again boarded the
"Ford", bound for1
our home in War-
ren about 18 miles away, We had
a most pleasant visit with an old
friend from pioneer days, and we
thank him f6r all kindness received
in his hospitable home.

home is in Newfolden, was out "hunt
ing last Sunday and when coming to
a bridge stopped to rest, standing
his gun up against the railing. In
some manner the gun fell down and

AN IDEAL PICNIC SPOT
IN MARSHALL COUNTY
On a recent auto trip T. L. Mel
gaard of the Citizens' State Bank,
discovered what is probably one of
the best picnic grounds in this im
mediate section of the state, espe
cially when it comes to a pretty set
ting. Over in Foldahl township of
Marshall county there is an old grist
mill which was no doubt built when
the country was first settled. The
iStructure gives evidence of having
one time been well patronized,
but with the* advent of more modern
methods has gradually passed inty
oblivion. To-day the wheel is nearly
destroyed by the elements^ *f
The mill is situated in a*valley
and nestled at the foot of hills which
gives the place an ideal surrounding,
and which makes it a fine place to
go for a picnic or all day vacation.
/It is far enough away from the var
ious towns so that it is not much
patronized and people can thoroughly
enjoy themselves.Thief River Falls

The Warren High School will open
the season on the local gridiron next
Saturday, when it will play the
Argyle High School foot ball team.
The team has had a good week of
hard practice and the boys feel con
fident they can start the game on
Saturday and make a good showing
for themselves.
Coach Seleck feels that he has as
good a team as can be expected for
the number of fellows that are will
ing to play. If the team- plays
anywhere near well, the High School
will have a good reason to be proud
of their'boys.
The people of Warren should take
notice of the fact that the High
School will play and that the boys
need a large crowd to encourage
them onward to victory. The team
will play under a good deal of ex
pense and needs all the money it
can get to come even on the financial
side.
Let's all pull together and be out
to the game on Saturday at 3
o'clock sharp.

$580 From One Acre of Ground
Louis Stordahl, of town of Rollis,
Marshall County, raised 580 pounds
of "Grimm" alfalfa seed from one
acre of ground. Mr. Stordahl is one
of the best farmers near Gatzke but
his land is no better than the aver
age found around here. We do not
know what this "Grimm" strain of
seed is worth at the present time,
but last year the seed houses quoted
it at $1.00 per pound. At that rate
the crop raised on that acre will
bring $580.
CALF HIDE FETCHES AS
MUCH MONEY AS DID
WHOLE "CRITTER."
Hans Anton, one of the real farm
ers of Pennington county tells a
good one which illustrates the value
of farm produce and the prices
which obtain at the present time as
compared with those of a few years
ago. v.
Last week Mr. Anton killed a calf
and after properly dessing the an
imal, securing thereform a full bar
rel of solid meat which was retained
for family use, the hide was brought
to town and sold to a local butcher
for $8.50.
A few years ago Anton states that
he was lucky if he secured $10 or
$12 for the whole animal, hoof, hide
and horns, and he is much elated
over present prices and says that a
farmer who raises stock at the pres
ent time is right in the swim.
Mr. Anton located in Pennington
bounty three years ago, aiid he has
made good. He has a fine herd of
Holsteins and has this fall erected a
new barn which is one of the most
up-to-date in this section.Thief
