Mystery today still surrounded the

these forces as comprising "consider

Rules that L. & N. President Must
.. Answer Questions Regarding
Campaign Contributions of
. His Railroad
(Associated Press)
-Washington, Oct. 4. That Milton
ll. Smith, president of the Louisville
& Nashville railway, must answer the
Interstate Commerce Commission's
questions regarding the political cam
paign fund contributions of the . road,
is the substance of a decision render
ed today by Justice Stafford of the
supreme court, District of Columbia.
The court held that the commission
had the right to know about such con
tributions, not because of their polit
ical nature, but because" 0they affect
questions of reasonableness of rates
and important questions of railroad
accounting. Mr. Smith refused sev
eral months ago to answer the questions-asked
by Joseph W. Folk, coun
sel for the commission, at the inquiry
into the affairs of. the Louisville and
Nashville and the Nashville, Chatta
nooga and- St. Louis. A series of ques
tions dealing with alleged political
contributions were submitted, approv
ed by Chairman Meyer of the commis
sion. They were unanswered by Smith
on advice of counsel.
The commission petitioned the court
to compel testimony.

council last night took steps looking
to the passage of an ordinance to re
quire bootblacks to pay a small li

tion under the police department.. It
was said that the bootblacks annoy
pedestrians by shouting. at them, and
gather in groups in front of places of
business causing a disturbance. City
Marshal Carter brought the matter to
the attention of council, saying that
complaints had been made to him. He
suggested a small license and a fixed

IN MEMORY OF
MRS. J. II. LIVINGSTON
By the Woman's Auxiliary Union of
the Baptist Church of Ocala
: Our sister, Mrs. J. H. Livingston,
having passed from this life to the
eternal home prepared for her by her
Savior, we grieve for her but notas
those who have no hope of , another
reunion in a home where there will be
a greater love and a better under
standing. . -We should emulate her
virtues in being always ready to ad
minister to the sick and V needy, to
visit the poor and unfortunate, to
sympathize with the sad and" trou
bled. .
She was strong in ; her convictions
and stood firmly for what she believ
ed to be right. Always her pastor's
friend, she was ready and willing to
be a helper in her Sunday , school and
church, feeling always that the Mas
ter's work was her work and her duty.
A friend remarked in- speaking of
her death she "thought it a beautiful
passing from this life into the next;
she had finished a good 'day's work,
had said her evening prayer, had
lain down to Seep and waked up with
her Father in heaven."
"We fancy when the day was o'er v
Beside her bed she knelt once more.
And prayer, as oft before,
And when she was peacefully sleeping
And there was no sound of weeping,
Dio loved one hovered around her bed
And with aching heart whispered "she
is dead." .
The God of love sent from above
A legion of angels to guide through
the night
Her pure spirit to regions of lieht.
Bor when a soul without sickness or
pain is wafted above
It is only another evidence of God's
great love." -- ...
We extend to the sons and daugh
ters, the grandcnildren and other rela
tives our heartfelt sympathy.

New York, Oct. 4. The National

Graw, of the New York Giants, that
his team played listless baseball yes
terday when Brooklyn defeated the
Giants and captured the National
League pennant, according to Presi

New York, Oct. 4. Brooklyn won
the National League pennant yester

half a game over Philadelphia, even
though Philadelphia should win both
of its final games from Boston.

Shady, Oct. 3. Just as soon as the
yankees begin to come down, the

It is an ill wind that blows nobody
any good. The well digging machine
blew in Monday and the Shady school
children were told that a good, Chris
tian man will see to it that after this
they need cry for water no more.
Sore eyes prevail in this neighbor
hood and being no respecter of per
sons, they gave our school ma'am
trouble last week and caused a short
age in the prescribed average for the
month's attendance at school. The
school has forty pupils enrolled and a
few attend who are not enrolled, be
ing a little under school age. It is
impossible for us to send the advanc
ed class tb Ocala, for different reas
ons, and we are particularly anxious
to keep this grade up out here, as
otherwise these students will be cut
out of school at a very premature
time. We are hoping to furnish some
good teachers for the county and a
few are preparing to take examina
tion for same in June.
We would be glad is some one would
give us some information about the
parent-teacher club. Where can we
get literature on this subject. We
shall appreciate hearing from some
one through the Star. -

CITY'S HEW SYSTEM
Of Sewerage is Complete and Ready
to be Put in Operation
The city's new $100,000 sewerage
system, with its improved Imhoff
tanks, is ready- for use. House . con
nections with the sewer mains can
now be made at any time. Mr. David
Henney, engineer for the city, told
council last night, when asked for his
opinion on the, recommendations of
the state board of health for treat
ment beds for the effluent of the Im
hoff tanks, that the matter had been
taken up with the board of health and
a written permit asked for. Mr. Hen
ney said that the permit had not yet
been received, but thought there
would be no objection to using the
sewerage system as it stands, pending
the receipt of the permit He thought
the effluent from the Imhoff tanks so
much purer than the raw sewerage
going into the numerous sewer wells
in the city, there could be no objec
tion to the use .of the sewer system
without the treatment beds, until the
permit is obtained.
Plumbing Inspector Minshall yes
terday afternoon examined a number
of master plumbers, and the follow
ing stood the examination success
fully: Joseph Needham, Joseph An
derson, II. J. Ashley, J. W. Akin, II.
W. Tucker and Paul A. Durand. Ar
rangements can.be made -with the
plumbers, or with the plumbing in
spector, who now has an office in the
city hall, for the making of house
connections. The first connection au
thorized was for the' Empire Cafe
building,- which is city property. This
was authorized by council last night
at the request of Mr. B. B. JBaum,
proprietor of the cafe.
Since the plumbing ordinance first
came up for consideration before
council, there has been much said with
regard to the plumbers combining and
charging outrageous prices for work
dene in connection with the sewerage
system. Council has never feared a
combination of the plumbers. Coun
cil let it be known last night, how
ever, that it would fight any attempt
on the part of the plumbers to com
bine to fix prices.
In a letter to council, Mr. Lanier
Robertson said that the city plumbing
inspector had informed him that cer-1
tain work could be done for 18 cents,
and that a plumber had said that the
work would cost 25 cents. Mr.
Robertson suggested a combination on
the part of the plumbers to fix prices.
He suggested that it might be a good
thing to have the plumbing inspector
make estimates of work to be done, in
order that the plumbers might be kept
within reason. Mr Robertson said
that he would be willing to pay a fee
for such inspection on the part of the
plumbing inspector.
Plumbing Inspector Minshall .in
formed council that he had had a con
versation with Mr. Robertson, but had
never given him a price on work. Mr.
Minshall said that the plumbers were
entitled to a reasonable profit. The
plumbing ordinance does not say
where materials shall be purchased.
Mr. Minshall suggested to council
that the plumbers be required to fur
nish a small bond, to protect the city
in the event of accidents due to open
sewer work. It was pointed out that
the city would not be liable for dam
ages in such cases, but the small bond
would cover costs whenever the city
was made party to a suit, tl was
thought by councilmen that existing
ordinances would operate to prevent
accidents of the kind referred to. No
action was taken on Mr. Minshall's
suggestion. -
THE SILVER SPRINGS ROAD
Superintendent Marsh, of the street
department, has completed the patch

died. He said that he had watered
the trees twice just after they were
planted.

vise these good people of Shady to do
something for themselves. Why don't
thev create a sub-school district and
'c rpi
board was generous enough to build
them a nice, comfortable school house
two years ago. They did likewise for-
Fellowship. We needed a well; did
we raise a howl? No, we got together
and put our hands down in our pock
ets and dug a well without asking the
board to contribute one cent, and
there is not a day that from one to.
ten autoists do not stop to get water.
We also created a sub-school district
some fifteen years ago and assess
ourselves the full limit of three mills,
raising from $350 to $400 annually in
the district, and every cent goes in
our school. This scribe would like to
see every school in the county made a
sub-school district and the millage -raised
to five mills. -
This being the end of the third
quarter, quite a number of old vets
are made happy by receiving their .
pension money. They are certainly
deserving of this little compensation.
