HUGHESBALLOTA
VOTE IN THE DARK
So Far As His Future Ac
tions Determine.
HE IS A MM OF OBCECTllllffl
How Is It Possible To Know
WhaOiughes' Policies
Would Be?
HIS ATTITUDE IS GUESSWORK
The Springfield (Mass.) Repub
lican eays:
One of the fiercest of the hate
Wilson, German language papers,
the Herold, of New York City, tells
iU readers: "What Hughes might
do is not part of tho question, but
wh.it Wilson has done." A clear
case, Is that, of voting for an incer--tajnty
against a certainty. So far as
the next President is concerned, it
Is a case of voting in the dark, and
voting In the dark is a leap in the
dark.
The admission of the German lan
guage press that it is impossible to
know what to expect of a Hughes
administration calls attention to but
one aspect of the question. What a
Ilepubllcan ' Administration would
do, or could do, along any line of
real importance cannot be forecast.
The generalities, evasions and si
lence, of Candidate Hughes concern
ing what ho would do as President
are even more striking than his fail
ure to answer squarely and explicit
ly what he would have done In WII
'son's place. It Is highly Improbable
that Mr. Hughes, even to save his
political life, could tell what he
would do, in the next Presidential
-term, if placed-ln power by the peo
ple. And this is not due entirely to
..thofact thai he cannot read the fu
ture; it is due largely to the fact
that the political forces that have
rallied to his support which must be
depended upon to sustain him when
In office, nro lacking in real unity
and, aside from their anti-Wilson-
Ism, are discordant in purpose and
aspiration.
With the Republican candidate
supported by such grotesquely an
tagonistic elements as the pro-German
New York Staats Zeltung and
the pro-British' Now York Tribune,
by George Sylvester Viereck on the
one hand and Lyman Abbott and
Robert Bacon on tho other hand, by
iTt. Hexamar, head of the German
American Alliance, at one end, and
by Theodoro Roosovelt at the other
end, how Is it possible for us toj
know what Mr. Hughes' policy would
lie on the various questions of 'the
European war? The Republican
ierord in Congress since the war be
gan reveals a majority of Republican
members of the House voting for tho
"McLemore resolution warning Amer
icans not to exorcise their rights of
travel on tho high seas out of fear
of ftlctlon with Germany, and It la
notorious that many Republicans
"would huvo voted In favor of an em
bargo on tho exports of war muni
tions, concprning which Mr. Hughe
has not opened his mouth, had tho
question been forced to tho front.
What would bo tho attitude of a
Republican Administration ioward
Oreat Britain, In view of tho prob
able prolongation of the war, on tho
Aarious Issues that have arisen, and
steadily grown moro grave, concern
ing tho blockade, the blacklist and
tho mall censorship? There aro pro
Brltlsh supporter of Mr. Hughes so
otromo that they publicly avow tho
wish that tho Uultcd .tates would
abandon its neutral rights in favor
of Great Britain, but would Mr.
Hugrra na Proaldont, carry out such
policy? Mr. Hushes himself does
not know. How could he know in
view of the motley character of his
political support, which runs through
nil grades of sympathy with alien
iH'lllgerents? Mr. Hughes, as Pros
Ideut. -could not possibly havo moro
thnn a bare majority supporting him
ljthe Senate, yet among those Re
publican Senators would bo found
no coherence of opinion concerning
TiHrpnean Wur Isfiuos. The debate
on We Gore resolution last winter
proved that. When Republicans
talk, as Mr. Taft did recently, about
having' "u consistent and intelligent
policy" for Issues connected with
the- war and its ending, they ignore
the glaring fact that their party to.
day Is n bedlam of antagonistic ele
ments, utterly incapable, so far as
any one can now Bee, of executing a
Hughes, as President, carry out such
constructive program.

fa ik was big success
Morgantown, Ky Sept. 20.
About 4,000 persons attended the
Butler County School Fair here to-
Vlay, Including 1,400 pupils and
teachers. The street parade consist
ed of floats, decorated automobiles
and buggies. The Moorctown school
float took tho ilrst prl.o Big Mud

Bunch, of Provo, took the prize In
tho foot race.
The court house was used for ex
hibition purposes and the display
was creditable to the school children
of tho county. No hall in town was
largo enough to accommodate half
of the crowd. So there was but lit
tle speaking, and drills, plays,
marches, singing and n general so

and Superintendent A. L. Hnynes In

Chicago, Sept. 30. The race of
Indians is no longer a dyjng race,
Cato Sells, United States Commis
sioner of Indian Affairs, announced
here to-day on his return from an
inspection trip through Western In

Indians in this country, ho said, than
there has been at any time since
the Bureau of Indian Affairs was es

ing up as a race which will hold Its
own," Mr, Sells-said, -
"A vigorous health campaign was
uegun among them three years ago
and the Indian is rapidly b"Coming
a producer of wealth, Instead of a
m'ero consumer."
There are SiiO.OOn Indians in 23
States, settled on 80 reservations,
Mr. Sells said. Tho death ratp has

HEWS OF STATE DEPMTMiNT
Germany Is Expected to Stand
By Her Assurances Alade
"Last May-
URGENT OPPOSITION, HOWEVER
Washington, Sept. 30. Increas
ing agitation In Germany for a com
plete resumption of submarine war
fare, Chancellor von Bothman-Holl-weg's
declaration before the Reich
stag that any statesman falling to
use Germany's every weapon to
shorten the war "deserves to be
hanged," and the recent apparently
Inspired simultaneous publication in
German papers of attacks on Amer
ican neutrality, brought forth to-dny
an authoritative, though Informal,
statement from the State Depart
ment as to the American Govern
ment's attitude toward the situation.
Any action which endangers
American lives through the sinking
of ships without warning or by fall
ing to provide proper safeguards,
was emphatically asserted, will re
open Immediately the submarlno
question with all its possibilities.
But so far, in spito of what is going
on In Germany, there has been abso
lutely, no Indication in the official
advices to tho department that Ger
many has violated the agreement ar
rived at In the Sussex case.
Reports of the sinking of nearly
300 merchantshlps since June havo
been- received -officially,- bub; in no
case has-lt been proved that Ameri
can lives were endangered. Until
such proof is at hand, tho situation
will i emnln just ns it lias been since
May S, when the American reply
was sent accepting Germany's re
pudiation, offer of reparation and
cseurnnces for the future In the Sus
sex case.
High ollicials think It unnecessary
to make any formal statement on
the subject, as they feel the Ameri
can position is fully known both at
home and abroad. No-opposition
was expressed, however, to a re
statement of tho Government's posi
tion. The possibilities which a
change of Germany's policy might
open up are so great that every of
fort will be made to have a full un
derstanding on all sides.
Emphatic denials that Germany
has any Intention of reopening a re
lentless campaign of submnriue war
fare are contained in confidential ad
vices from Berlin to diplomatic
quarters here. All dispatches re
ceived by diplomats friendly to tho
Teutonic Allies are .described as
clearly Indicating that Germany In
tends fully to live up to her assur
ances.
It Is acknowledged that there Is
considerable opposition in Germany
to this policy of the Government and
that a strong party la ursing tho
more liberal use of thu undersea
weapon. Tho situntlon Is not new,
nnd, go far as is known here, the op
position to tho Government's policy
Is no ptrongcr now than before.
So far as American officials are
concerned tho reoeiit agitation lu
Germany has caused various degroch
of anxiety. Some see In It merely
tho bitter demonstration of a party
out of powor, whose exact strength
Is nut known, but v.hloh is thought
not powerful cnouph to overthrow
tho Chaucellor, who is commlttou
against Illegal submarine warfare.
Tho Chancellor's latest fcpeech is not
Interpreted In such quarters as fore
jhadowlng his conversion to ruth
less submarine activity, for It 1'
pointed out that ho may well hold
that normally" is now gaining nil
that cau possibly be gaiueil from her
submarine weapon.
Others, however, aro Inclined to
take tho oppo'slto view, believing
that the Chancellor hns been won
over to the Von Tirpltz party. They
arguo that with tho gradual crush
ing In of the Gcrmau lines and tho
increased realization that England
i3 tho supor enemy, pressure In Gor
niany will become irresistible to
strike in every possible way.
It was reiterated again to-day
tluit Ambassador Gerard, uow on his'
I
way to the United States for a vaca
tion, had not been summoned home
from Berlin to discuss the submarine
or any other Issue, and that If any
crisis were at hand or expected, he
would, under no clicumntances, be
allowed to leave his post. It Is ad
mitted that while hero, as a niattci
of course, he will give the Depart
ment fuller Information on all mat
ters of Interest than he could give
by mail.

BIDS FOR PROGRESSIVE VOTE
Long Branch, N. J.. Sept. 30. Inj
v vigoious denunciation oi tile ite -
publican party President Wilson to -
dny told a delegation of young Dem
ocrats from New York that "the cer
tain prospect" of Republican success
In November Is that "we shall be
dinwn in one form or another luto'cuit Court Monday morning. Tha
the embroilments of European wnr"
and that "the force of the United
States will be used to produce in
.Mexico tho kind of law and' order 1 1'" week of the term. Three Com
whlch some Investors in Mexico con- charged with murder and Jack Wor-
sider most to their advantage."
The President made his ilrst out
and out political speech of the cam
paign from the porch of Shadow
Lawn. Urged on by tho enthusias
tic cheers and waving banners of
several thousand young men, he as
sailed tho Republican party and
laid down the Issues on which v
believes the campaign should be
fought.
"Am I not right that wo must
draw tho conclusion that if the Re
publican party is put into power at
the next election our foreign policy
will be radically changed?" he ask
ed. "I cannot draw any other Infer
ence. All our present foreign poli
cy is wrong, they say, and if it Is
wrong and they nre men of con-
' s-cience. they mt.st chansc It. And if
! they are going to change it, in h.u
direction are they going to clung'
I It? There Is only one choice as
agninst pence, and that Is war."
Charging that Republicans take
the counsel of "those who have hith
erto acted as the counselors of the
vested interests In Mexico, " the Pres
ident declared that these men had1
tried to got what they wanted from,
him, but had failed and "now arpl
going where they think they can '
get it." i
Still discussing the foreign affairs'
of the country. President Wilson
stated that on account of the polit
ical uses made of foreign relations
"it is going to be practically Impos
sible tor the present Administration
to handle any critical matter con
cerning our foreign relations, be
cause all foreign statesmen are wait
ing to see which way the election
goes, and in the meantime they
know that settlements would be
inclusive"
Most of the President's addres-s wa.s
devoted to criticisms of the Repub
lican party and to outlining his own
plnns. In front nnd below him were
young Democrats who came herf'!
from New York on special trains and
marched with bands playing and
banners waving more than a mile to,1
Shadow Lawn. Frequently he was
forced to stop speaking for several
minutes while the applause lasted.
A bid was made by tho President
for the votes of Progreaslvos. He
praised the Progressive party as hav
ing "tho real red blond of liuimci
sympathy In its elti3," and deekwtl
the Democratic party lied done th
things tho ProKrcaslrra v anted done.
Briefly tho Prcslduut referred to
tho hyphenato lssuon. Ho laid:
"Ba'ck of that party (the Republic
an) are those who want to Inject
Into our Politic the pol'ilc of Eu
i ope."
Again attaching, tho Republican
party ho said llruteuaaU of Mark
Henna havo returned to authority

publican party.
Outlining the program of the
Democratic party Mr. "Wilson ald It
has begun tho process of "UberalUa

that system at every point, extend
It at every point, extend It whorever

Lancaster, O., Oct. 1. Neighbor
of Agnes and Alice Smctter.s, maiden
sisters, 48 and 50 years old, respec
tively, seeing no activity about the
home of the two women to-day, en
tered the house to-night and found
; the two women and Miss Mary Stret-
, ton, 30, a visitor, sitting erect in
rocking chairs and all three dead.
There was no sign of violence or
poisoning, and an examination of
the gas pipes revealed no liks.
Medical attention revealed no cause
for the deaths and the bodies have
. been taken charge of by the Coro
ner, who Is attempting to solve the
mystery of the deaths.
That death had come quietly was
evidenced by the fact that one of tha
sisters had her glasses on and waa
holding a newspaper. There was no
food in the house except half of an
apple pie and this showed no sign of
poisoning.
The stomachs of the three women
will be sent to Columbus Monday
for analysis to see if any poisou Is
