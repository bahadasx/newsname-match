Children Under Prescribed Age Will Get
Scant Consideration From Mayor in
Driver Permit Favors
MARVELS NO MORE
ACCIDENT OCCUR
Mayor Stands Strictly Against Children
Driving Cars 4'and Don't Care Whose
Kids They Are," He Says
"I am strictly opposed to any kid un
der the age prescribed hy ordinance
driving a motor car," declared Mayor
O. Cofi'man to an Express reporter this
morning, "and 1 do not care whoso
kid it is." The mayor had been dis
cussing the perils of allowing steering
wheels of automobiles to be placed in
the hands of children who, though
they may know the first principles of
auto car direction, have not sufficient
judgment to know what to do in an
emergency.
"I do not know how the council
stands in the matter but for myself I
shall do all tTrat I can to keep these.
kids away from the wheel regardless
of what they appear to know or actu
ally do know about driving. And
those who are givyi licenses to drive
must not only be of proper ago but
must actually be drivers.
"This, of course, does not. apply to
children under eighteen or whatever
age is fived for driving an automobile
with adults at their sides In the same
seat as a protection in case of danger.
But i-i.Cs,; adults ..nust also know how
to manage a car."
Muyor Cofi'man has not yet decided
on the personnel of the new driver's
examining board but those who com
pose it will be men thoroughly inform
ed in the premises. His "onor is cast
ing about for eligibles, is paying strict
attention to men engaged in garages
who are familiar not only with the di
rection but the mechanism of cars.
Anyone securing permits to drive must
be qualified, he says.
"With the amount of reckless driving
that has been done by children both in
and out of the city it is a wonder that
no more accidents have occurred and
that many people have not been kUled.
All this must stop."
The mayor announced that he.will
have his appointments ready for the
regular meeting of the council next
week.
The Mayor also said the board
which will In entrusted with tlvi be-
.. ,c,-.vl of privileges in Chickasha in
the future will be composed of men
who will appreciate the grav.A
results which might ensue from grant
ing driving licenses to ineligibles or to
boys and girls who may be lacking in
judgment or imbued with a sense of
smartness while in charge of a steer
ing wheel. Hitherto the board con
sisted of one man who had never driv
en an automobile, another who drives,
one indifferently and one who drives. I
This board was selected wheu t! c
question was not one of moment and
as little attention was paid to its per
sonnel as was given to the ordinance
prescribing the age limit at which per
sons in Chickasha might drive.
The new board, however, will be a
different institution and v.iil resist
ooth the r.tormings and pleadings r.f
boys who may be cut out of the chauf
feur class.

Meanwhile the milk supply has dwln
died rapidly. Over on the east side
where the increased prices or tht
nonage was first lclt, it is common
to see little children with pails beg
