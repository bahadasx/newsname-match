As we read of the American pro

as a people with the world. More
ease, more comfort, more luxury;
are the natural inheritence of more
labor, more thought, more educa
tion of. those whu have gone and
are goyig before. As we go in and
around in our little section here,
seei * the latest improved saw mill." J
and hustling the woods into heaps
of lumber, and the road-ways speed
ed by automobiles of varied manu
facture, we can but knew we are .
growing nation, therefore, 1 l:Tp
up, we j must naturally turn more
thought to the improvement of ed
ucation!
How:we long for time to come
that our people way awaken to this
important f3ct. Along this ad
vance in temporal things, I am also
impressed that our people are liable
to neglect, unintentionally on part
of many, that of spiritual na?ure,
the one most important *>f them al!.

our memory to the days at Sunday

recall Uncle Joe Bussey who taught
a class of boys on opposite side of
the aisle.
Mr. Arthur McDaniel and Mr.
George Bearden who added to our
singing, seemed to enjoy being
there, and was there almost as reg
ular as any of us, unless it was Mr.
Pat Bussey. We are sure few con
sider the importance of punctuality
at Sunday School as well as day
schools.

Opening of the Baily Military
Institute.
The formal opening exercises of
Baily Military Institute were held
in the Chapel before a large enthu
astic Greenwood audience, Monday
morning, Sept. 24tb, at ll o'clock.
Sitting on the rostrum were four
teen members of the faculty, the
pastors of the various City Church
es, members of the board of visit
ors, Dr. Willson, President of Lan
der College and other prominent
men.
The scriptures were read by Dr.
Green, pastor of tho First Presbyte
rian Church, after which Rev. P.
H. Bussey led in prayer. Col.
Bailey, the Superintendent, then in
troduced Dr. Villson, President of
Lander College, who made a short
and interesting talk. The princi
pal address of the morning was de
livered by Dr. E. M. Pote-i, Presi
dent of Furman University. Dr.
Poteat chose as his subject, Success,
and in his characteristic style, out
lined to the young men, the way of
success. Mr. W. W. Fuller, Su
perintendent of Education of Edgo
field County, was then introduced
and made quite an interesting talk.
Dr. Sam Hodges, representative of
the Board of Visitors, ?hen spoke
for a few moments. The announce
ment was then made .but there were
202 f-adeL. in alter dan ce, ibis being
the largest number in tho history of
the justitution. The rSnpennten
dent stated that a large number of
j young men wh^ desired <.) enter as
'cadets, were turned away on ac
? count o " lack of room.
The class room work began Mon .
?day morning and everything "ap
J smoothly during the week. On ac
count of the large enrollment it has
j been necessary tu d'vide the first
gi second year classes into three

essitated the employment of an

_t was fortunate in securing thc
services of Capt. R. C. Moore, who

FROM PACIFIC COAST.
Mr. P. B. Day Sr., Enjoying
Western Trip. Writes Inter
estingly of Journey and of
California.
Los GATOS, CAL.,
Sept. 21, 1916.
Dear Mr. Mime:
According to promise I will give
you some data in regard to my
Western trip, San Francisco being
the terminal point. Leaving Au
gusta on tie 30th of August (noon)
passing through Atlanta, my first
stop was New Orleans, only for
thirty minutes. Travelling through
the best cotton section cf Louisiana
at night, I can not tell vou anything
about this crop. But 1 was toM
that it was considerably off from aa
average crop. In the cane belt was
large acreage, all under irrigation
and to me it looked good. Corn
crop very poor. Now and (hen big
fields of rice, some of it had been
harvested with binder and shocked.
Did not see any cotton crops in
Texas as we passed this belt also at
night.
Traveling near one thousand
miles through Texas, and five hun
dred and sixty miles through Colo
rado, the greater part of this on the
railroad is a vast desert, ai.d torrid.
I was toid that this section was
principally cattle ranches, but the
stock must have been in the back
ground as veiy few were in eight.
Next mo-ning f jund ourseiv\.? in
Cal'Cornia, un' . t 10 p. m., on the
1 20th of Sept -iilisr, af cer a continu
' '.ur il^e of 2500 miles we reached
Los Angels (called city of Ange's.)
From New Orleans crude petroleum
oil is used to generate steam in
placo of coal, and except for oil ard
water practically no stops were
made. It requires from six to
e4?.b.c -gilio-D* ?>f:>-i?v'.pec-mi!e.
these huga' engines. And the road
bcd was so smooth that at times
vou could scarcely tell that the
tiain was moving. Los Angels with
a population of from 600 to 800,000,
and adjacent towns is said to be
the most favored spot of California.
At Huntington Park, a little vil
lage near Los Angeles, live Mr. and
Mrs. Le Sueur, (Miss Katie Sulli
van, formerly of Edgetield.) It had
been many years t>inoe I had seen
her, but I recognized her at once
and you can imagine my feelings to
meet some one that I really knew
so far from home, and she looking
so much younger than I expected to
find her, and enjoying the best of
health-for on leaving Atlanta
ab^-'t eleven .,ears ago in miserably
poor health, you can readily see
that the climate here is simply
grand. It was my first acquaint
ence with her devoted husband of
seventy-five years, one of the old
fashioned Southern gentleman. Of
course I accepted their hospitality
and by their aid I was enabled to
visit many beautiful and interesting
points, that perhaps I might have
overlooked. I was particularly im
pressed with Long Beach and Pasa
dena, each of these places support
ing a population of 40 to 60,000.
These places including Holly-Wood
are beautified with handsome homes
and gardens of millionaire from all
over the United States. The ho
tels at th ase places are as luxurious
as you will find in New York city,
(I am told.) It's safe to remark here
that southern California is blessed
with the finest climate in the world.
And while the oranges grow here
profusely and I saw many well
kept groves, the lack of moisture
underground (unless by irrigation)
and the dryness of the climate, the
foliage as well as the fruit did not
appear to be as luxurious as those
I have seen in Florida. The grape
fruit of California is not nearly as
finely flavored as that grown in
Florida, while the lemons are sup
posed to be finer flavored. From
Los Angeles, a ride of about four
hours, I went to Sac Diego, going
through a country dotted with truck
farms, alfalfa, walnuts and a tre
mendous area growing lima beans
that were being threshed. San
Diego is a beautiful spot, a good
harbor, dry climate, bathing in tho
surf indulged in all through the
year. The ocean here is as blue as
the sky and some tell me more
beautiful and bluer than the famous
Bay of Naples.
The Exposition here has been
opened nearly a year, and thronged
