PITTSBURGH, Pa.. Oct. 4.—(Oa
board President Wilson's train.)—
President Wilson is rushing westward
today for his first' big campaign
speech in the heart of the country.
His mission tills time, his manager
says, has the same object as when
he followed the same route last win
ter. He goes to urge "preparedness
for peace."-
The "peace insurance" then desired
and later secured, was a vote from
congress materially strengthening the
army and navy. Now he wants a
vote from the people on whether his
"foreign policy of peace" shall be
preserved, %r whether the republican
party shall be placed in power and
this policy changed. The president
has declared such a change would
certainly draw the nation "in the
embroilments of the European war."
The new rallying* cry of the demo
cratic leaders is "prepare for peace
by reelecting Wilson."
_Omaha, where the president speaks
Thursday evening, is the heart'of the
great agricultural community inhere
the peaoe appeal has always found
enthusiastic welcome.
'me president was here neagy two
hours early today, but few knew It.
Several hundred railway men and a
few democratic enthusiast^ stood
about- the private car in which the
president slept. From Chicago he
takes an "air line": route to Omaha
with few stops.

MASSILLON, Ohio, Oct 4. [On
Board President Wilson's train.]—
President Wilson's first Journey into
the central west since accepting re
nomination for office has served to
delight his political managers.
While holding- striotly to his inten
tions of making no speeches which
might characterise his trip as a
campaign Junket, President Wilson
today greeted thousands of voters
who turned out along the route and
accorded him tremendous receptions.
At Salem, Alliance, Canton and
other points, where brief stops were
made, fully 20,1COO thronged about his
car. No calls were made for speeches.
Nothing but shouting and cheering
and the president responded only
waves of the hand and handshakes.
At Can ton he halted the demon
stration Jong enough to send his re
gards to Senator Pomerene, demo
cratic candidate for re-election, who
is facing a hard fight in this state.
'^Please give my regards to Sen
ator Pomerene," the president said,
and was cheered.
The president characterized his trip
so far as "the kind of hospitality that
makes a man's heart -very warm."
Willie Wae In the Crowd. I
ALLIANCE, Ohio, Oct. 4.—"Well.

WITH THE PftfflNCH ARIMIBS ON
THE SOMIME, Oct 4.—The allies
have now widened their breach in
the German lines on the Somme front
over a forty-five kilometer front
(about twenty-five miles) to a max
imum depth of fifteen kilometers
(about eight and one-half miles).
In the early days of the offensive
the allied attacks were delivered on
a front extending from a point north
of the Albert-Bapaume highway to a
point north of Chaulnes. The cap
ture last week of Thiepval extended
the British attack almost to the Ancre
brook. The French reached south
of Chaulnes and captured the village
of Chilly.
A heavy rain that hindered opera
tions for two days, ceased falling
yesterday noon and artillery began
tuning up, particularly south of the
river.
North of the Somme the French
last night completed the conquest of
a Gernyin trench between Morvai and
St. Pierre Vaast wood, taking 200
prisoners. South of the river, there
was a violent bombardment in the
region at Belloy-En-Santerre, ibut no
Important Infantry fighting.
Whole Village Taken.
LONDON, Oct 4.—The village of
Eaucourt-L'Ahbaye, thfee miles from

The British lines were pushed for
ward into the village several days
ago, but the Germans clung tenacious
ly to several houses. These were
cleared of the enemy in last night's
fighting.
After a slight intermission, the
heavy downpour of rain was resumed
on the Somme front yesterday after
noon, Interfering with Infantry oper

EL PASO, Texas, Oct. 4.—The ar
rival early today in Juarez of two
wounded officers from the Casarf
Grandes garrison, lent color to the
reports that the Cairanzlsta garrison
at the latter town and a small body
of Villista bandits had clashed near
there. Casas Grandes Is located on
the communication lines of Pershing's
expedition.
Many residents of Juarez stayed on
the American side of the border last
night, fearing an attack on the town.
Current rumors had set the date for
an attack by Villistas as October
fourth.'
The last report to the military
authorities at Juarez placed the ban

is swarming with .Carranzista rein
forcements, the pursuit of the ban

MEXICO CITY, Oct 4.—Reports

that General Cairanza has demanded
the immediate withdrawal of Ameri

at Atlantic City, unless the troops are
withdrawn at once.
Colonel Juan Barragan, chief of
staff to General Carranza, will ac

NEW YORK, Oct.
4.—Strains
from
the ex-presldsnts harmony duet stIU
cloyed the atmosohere around repub
lican headquarters today. William fl.
Taft and Theodore Roosevelt had met
—shaken hands—and spoken.
Two years ago they met at a fun
eral. Last night it was a sort of
christening bee. The christenee was
harmony. The Union League club
was the christening spot. No mere
reporters were permitted to dese
crate the scene—but—.
Roosevelt and Taft did shake
hands. They both asked "how'd you
do," but neither answered the ques
tion. There was not anyone who
heard any "dear Will" or "dear Theo
dore" stuff. The two merely nodded,
Taft stuck his hand out Theodore
grabbed it, gave it one up and down
pump and dropped It Then the two,
with Chauncely M. Depew standing
between them stood In line while all
the big republicans in New York City
passed along behind open faced suits
and with outstretched hands that
shook hands vtith former presidents
and would be president—he Chas. E.
Hughes, on the same night That
much was agreed today by everyone
who was inside while the reporters
were kept outside, looking In.
As to Just who got the colonel and
3udge Taft together, there is a dif
ference of opinion. Taft arrived be
fore Roosevelt and had taken his
place in line, when Roosevelt shak
ing hands right and left appeared.
Some say Governor Whitman hooked
his arm through the colonel's, led
him over to Taft and said: "Mr.
Taft, here's Colonel Roosevelt." Some
say George R. Sheldon did the deed.
At any rate that's all there was to
it insofar as Taft and Roosevelt were
concerned. Some said they were cor
dial. Others said neither smiled.
This later was refuted by still others
who said It would have been physical
ly impossible for either to keep from
grinning.
But there were other little high
spots that made It almost as inter
esting as if the colonel and Taft had
hugged each other. For instance,
when Roosevelt got In the elevator,
who should have been crowded
against him but W. Murray Crane,
who is said to have accumulated as
many unsaid words as he has dol
lars. The two spoke—but Roosevelt
alone spoke above a whisper. When
he said his howdydo, Crane leaned
carefully over to the colonel's ear—
some say It was the colonel's right
ear others the left—and moved his
lips. Roosevelt, according to eye
witnesses, pretended to hear Crane
and in turn leaned to Crane's ear.

chl, premier of Japan, Is an effort of
the emperor to pick a man who will
win the support of the political fac
tions of Japan and put an end to the
.bitter party strife of the past few
years, according to Japanese officials
here today.
TeraUchl, being a military man, it
was said, belongs to no party and
therefore is in a good position to win
support to all factions. It is expected
that he will name a coalition cabinet.
The efforts being made to harmon
ize the political groups In Japan to
said to be for the purpose of getting
the country solidly behind the gov
ernment on the three big questions
of the day: Japan's relations with
the United States, her relations with
China and the question of taxation
for the maintenance and increase of
her army and navy.
Terauchi's attitude toward eastern
issues is not definitely known by
Japanese officials here, they say.
Speaking of his future stand on the
Japanese immigration and land ques
wlth the United States they
said, however, that Terauchi had a
reputation In Jrpan for extreme cau
tion regarding international questions
and that they were sure he would do
nothing to harm the friendly religions
between Japan and the United States.
Terauchi was formerly minister of
