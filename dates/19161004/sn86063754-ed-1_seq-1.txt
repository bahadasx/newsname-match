Zeb Green Says Cotton is Going
Still Higher
Mr. J. Z. Green, of Marsbville,
in his letter to the Progressive
Farmer last week said:
Under date of September 12 a
cotton market report by Cbas.
Fairchild & Co., of New York,
contains this paragraph:
"Exports so far this season are
double those of last year. American
mills are very largely un
covered with the actual, while
sold ahead for months of 25 cent
cotton."
I am glad Brother Poe gave
the deserved denunciation of
the stupendous falsehood sent
out from New Orleans to the
daily papers. The report that
Farmers* Union presidents had
adopted 12 cents as a minimum
price for their cotton after the
market price had already reached
fifteen cents, was published
not onlv in the daily papers but
was copied by many weekly papers.
For the life of me I
couldn't understand how any
publisher could believe such a
ridiculous and unbelievable
piece of news. Nobody but a
crazy man would, as reoresenta
tive of cotton producers, declare
for a price three cents a pound
less than the current price of
cotton.
When farmers are robbed bv
this sort of publicity there ought
to be some way to recover damages.
If such an outrage were
perpetrated against the business
of an individual or corporation,
those responsible for the damage
would no doubt be neld to
account in the courts.
I have never seen a bolder attempt
by bear speculation to
beat down the price of cotton.
Certahily their fight to depress
the price must be hopeless when
they resort to such high-handed
and infamous methods to gain
even a temporary advantage.
If goods are now selling on a
basis of 25 cent cotton it isn't
unreasonable to expect the price
to go to 20 cents. In fact, nearly
everybody has been talking
20 cent cotton for a month or
T 1 4L!_ - ?
mure, i near mis Kind or lalK
from commercial men? from
bankers and from merchants as
well as farmers.
Don't rush cotton to market.
Never in the hjstory of cotton
growing will there be a better
chance for somebody to corner
the cotton market before we
can possibly produce anv more
cotton , and when the market is
cornered something is going to
happen Jo the prices of cotton.
'TL 1 ' -
i ins oniy way ior producers to
share in the increase in prices is
to sit steady and refuse to be
stampeded by any kind of "news"
item that may find its way into
the press dispatches.
A wounded soldier in a hospital
developed a fever, and even'

register his temperature.
Presently the doctor came to
see him.
"Well, how are you getting

"Fairish, sir," said the soldier.

Little Elsie came home from
a neighbor's house, munching a
cookie.
"Now, Elsie," her mother re
proved her, "how many times
have I told you not to ask Mrs.
Brown for cookies?"
"I didn't ask her," returned
Elsie salmly; "I don't have to; I
know where she keeps them."

Terrible Tragedy In Union
County
Monroe Journal.
Caught between the lever and
frame of his own cane mill last
Saturday the head of Mr. Alexander
Helms was crushed like
an eggshell, and he died that
afternoon without ever having
regained the slightest consciousness.
Mr. Helms was running a mill
at his home some nine miles
above Monroe in the Ebenezer
church communty, and there the
accident took place at eleven
o'clock. Mr. Elijah Little was
helping: him with the work at
the mill and was the only eye
witness of the terrible tragedy.
Mr. Little was feeding the mill,
and Mr. Helms was carrying the
sap from the mill to the evaporator.
While he was in the act of
filling a bucket, the lever caught
his head between it and the
frame, almost crushing the top
of his head from below his ears
on up. Both ears were torn
loose, and the brains were oozing
from the head. His head
was mashed between a space of
three and one-half inches.
Mr. Helms was a good man,
and had earned the respect and
confidence of his friends and
neighbors. He was nearly 62
years old, und was a son of the
late Thomas Helms. He is survived
by his wife and nine
children.
Howie Mine Damaged by Explosion
and Fire
Monroe Enquirer.
The building over the maipL
shaft at the Howi^a^, eight rtiiles
timbers sixty feet down tne shaft
were destroyed by fire about
two o'clock last Friday afternoon.
It is not known how the
fire originated. No one was in
the shaft at the time of the fire,
the last man having left the
shaft about twenty minutes before
the fire started. Two boxes
of dvnamite in the building
were exploded and a number of
windows in buildings near the
mine were shattered and the explosion
was heard for miles
around. Two pumps, one of
them costing $900 and the other
$500 are in the bottom of the
mine and the burning of the
large timbers caused the top of
the shaft to cave in leaving a
hole forty feet in diameter at the
top of the shaft. It will require a
great deal of work and an outlay
of about $5,000 to make
good the damage.

The least harm such state

merged and almost negligible
pacifists here to raise their heads
a little. But they are harmful to
us in the war. They may be in

are long, long months of arduous
war to face before Germany
will accept the terms that must
be enforced. J
Objects to Going to the Devil
By Automobile.
Charity and Children.
This writer is not opposed to
automobiles. In fact the only
reason he isn't sailing over the
country in a Ford is that his
creditors consume all his surplus
cash. But the abuse of the automobile
is a peril that threatens
to do us a great injury in many
ways. A man was telling us the
other day about an enthusiastic
church worker who bought a
machine. Gradually his interest
in the Sunday school and
church work weakened until finally
he quit going altogether,
and sent his pastor word to drop
r ? .*_? ??

that he had found a new source
of pleasure, and meant to pursue
it and let the.church go.
The natural result tollowed, He
began to drink beer and do other
things that go along with it
and is on the way to the devil at
30 miles an hour. It is true that
this man never had enough religion
to hurt him and less character
than religion, but while
this is an extreme case, it illustrates
the effect of Sunday joy
riding on anybody, who indulges
in it. We have seen church
members more than one time
deliberately load their families
on an automobile and start out
at 10 o'clock Sunday morning
ior a spin through the country.
No more sermons for them! No
more Sunday school! They have
have found a new avenue of
pleasure which ihey propose to
travel. The faithful will still attend
church and observe the
Lord's day. A. few of the loyal

men uunuren: inere is no law
to stop these jo? riders. There
is nothing to be done except to
appeal to the sober minded not
to be swept off their feet. "Re
member the Sabbath day to keep
it holy" is still in force. But
those who are crazy about automobiles
have no more reverence
for Sunday than for Tuesday.
The truth is, we have gone mad
over this matter of amusement,
and a multitude of our people
have surrendered absolutely to
its strange and subtle power!
Good roads are a great blessing,
but it is better to jolt over rocks
and plunge into gulleys in a one
horse wagon than to glide to the
devil over a road as smooth as a
ribbon in a luxurious automobile.
Couldn't Jump the Fence
Monroe Journal.
William Cuthbertson, an old
slave, overestimated his physical
prowess several days ago when
he attempted to jump over a
barb wire fence. Some of the
boys were at Mr. Tom McClellan's
blacksmith shop, six miles
northeast of Monroe, when Rev.
Bill came up. Knowing that he
was tond of soft drink, they offered
to buy him three bottles of
the stuff :f he would jump the
fence. Bill couldn't resist the
ale, so he tried it. Me failed,
and now he is laid up with a
broken leg. Mr. G. C. Baucom
says Bill is a good old darkey,
and that many are sympathizing
with him in his misfortune.
Mr. Smith Was Right, Too
Monroe Enquirer.
Mr. Run ford -Smith u/hn lJ*r*?o
near Pageland, S C., was in
Monroe a few days ago and in
speaking of the crops said that
the greatest peavine hay crop
ever grown had been saved.
Barns, sheds, outbuildings of every
description were filled with
peavine hay and then there was
lots of it to be stacked.
One Dead and Another U Fa- I
tally Injured
Columbia, S. C., Sept. 30.?A.
R. Moore is dead and M. A. i
Simms is in a local hospital ^
probably fatally injured as the ^
result of the overturning late
yesterday near Barnwell, S. C., t
of an automobile in which they c
were riding. Dr. J. C. Woolley i
and V. Seymour Qweos were t
painfully injured in the accident, j
while E. G. Bolen, the fifth member
of the partv, was unhurt.
All are residents of Barnwell. ^
Moore, who was a brother of f
Adjutant General W. W. Moore r
of South Carolina, and Simms j
were brought here late last t
night on a special train. Moore
died early today.
The party left Barnwell yes- r
terday for a dove-shooting trip. 1*
A short distance from town the t
automobile, which was driven by
Moore, struck a sandy spot I
in the road, became unmanageable
and a moment later over
turned. Moore and Simms were a
pinned beneath the machine. c

riders, ropers and busters came i
to take part. After the show i
had petered out, and the winners
had failed to get the bulk of t
their prize money, one of the re- 1
cent contestants, a long, lean f
youth from Arizona, called at the ^
office of the Evening World to r
give an inside version of the f
causes leading up to the collapse
of the enterprise. (
Presently Martin Green, to t
whom the cowptlhcher wasjgll- I
ing his troubles,-noticed th^t the ?
other walked with a limp. i
"Did you get hurt in one of t
the events?" inquired Green. c
"Naw!" confessed the young c
man with an embarrassed grin, a
"That there happened the day
after I struck this town. An
ortermobile hit me and sprained e
my right knee right smart and
broke three of my ribs.
"A doctor at one of these here f
tiosspitals fixed me up; and so I
went into the ropin' contest and \
the bulldawgin' contest. Then,
the third day, my pony fell with \
me; and while he was 'rastlin' p
round he kicked me here on the
chin and split my lip open. It p
taken seven stitches to close up
the cut. (
"Yas, suh; 1 done right well in
that there Stampede!" continued j
the youth, reverting to the topic
he had been discussing before
Green interrupted with the ques- *
tion touching on his lameness.
"I win twelve hundred and fifty ^
dollars on paper, even ef them
fellers did run out on us and '
leave me broke." ^
"But wasn't it frightfully painful
to be riding wild horses nnH ^
throwing steers with your ribs &
all caved in and your leg bungied
up and your face gashed?"
inquired Green. ^ ^
"Well," said the youth, "some- P

was this here durned climate." n
