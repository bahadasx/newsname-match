STRIKERS IN FORCE
DERAIL ENGINE AND
; ; STOP MORNING TRAIN
, The lawlessness of the striking
stevedores attained a fever height at
:15 this morning when they derailed
an engine pulling cars bearing strike
breakers from the Oahu depot to Pier
yi. Four closed and locked box-cars
made up the train with an engine on
each end. .
Sweeping past the police, theatrik
ers obstructed the rails in three places
in this railway yards when the train
rapidly bore " down upon them and a
wild shout of glee went up when their
scheme succeeded.
Engine Leaves Rails '
The first obstrnctlon placed in the
path of the on-rushing train, an empty
s?soline drum, proved effective and
' ;t ) hcao engine left the rails a short
dl.iance Ewa of Iwllei road, laicklly
no one was killed and It is consider
ed miraculous that , none was injured.
The ' cars bearing strike-breakers
were hurriedly backed into the yards
following tae wreck and a crew of rail
way laborers put to work to clear the
track. In threo hours the disabled en
eina was back on the track and about
9:30 the train went through to the ;
dock without difficulty, bur with a unl- i
formed policeman at every step; and
an escort of . mountea omcers.
