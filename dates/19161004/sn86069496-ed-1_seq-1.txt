SKETCHES.
Geo. W. Whitlock.
This week we speak of a traveling
salesman who has net been so many
years on the road as his competitors,
but he is as well acquainted as the
most of them. For four years he has
been traveling for A. Wanking & Cq.,
Louisville, and he has been very suc
cessful, his trade increasing as the
years come and go He visits the mer
chants in several counties, and is per
sonally known to all of them. There
is nob a hamlet in Green county but
knows Geo W. Whitlocka. For years
he was a prominent and very success
ful merchant at Fry, people tradiDg
with him from all the surrounding
country. When he went.on the road
he took up his residence in Campbells
ville, it being the most central point.
Besides representing the wholesale
house mentioned, he is interested in a
retail business in his home town. He is
' popular with every body, due to the
courteous manner in which he does
business. Socially, he is a very com
panionable gentlemen, and his word
is his bond. There is no friction be
tween him and his competitors. It is
hail fellow; well met with them all.
Hjs acquaintance in Adair covers all
the business points, and his visits to
the county are cordially received.
Mr. Whitlock lias a wife and sever
al children and he takes a great de
ligbt in working for them. We trust
that the prosperity that he is now en
joying will continue with him until
the end of his existence, and when he
has finished his work here below, he
will hear the welcome plaudit, enter
in and sit at My right.

Mrs. George Staples.
Bev. O. P. Bush closed a very inter
esting meeting in Eussell county last
week. It was held with a Church
about three miles from Jamestown.
While there was only one addition,
the Church was greatly revived, and
the attendance fine. On the 9th of
this month Rev. Bush will begin a
meeting at Milltown,
There will be services in the United
Brethren church Sunday morning, 11

The first and' second days of Novem
ber is the time aorreed an
road on the dug hill oa 't&lg
tabllshed by the surveyjlquires Shep
herd and Ellis have beenvse)ected ttf
take charge of the work aadJj of
them have agreed to do so. they will
go over the survey in a few days to
determine what is necessary to be
done and will map out a course of ac
tion which will be published as soon
as possible. Heretofore we have called
attention to the importance of this
movement and we trust that the peo
ple of Columbia as well as those living
on the road will respond in an unstint
ed manner. Too long Columbia has
already waited for development, wait
ed for business that never comes: too
long we have whittled cedar and hoped
for better business conditions without
making an energetic move to improve,
As matters now stand we mustet
busy or share the same handicaps in
the future as in the past. Between
Neatsville and the top of Dug Hill a
distance of one and a half miles, the
road is rough, steep and almost im
passible the greater part of the year.
Beyond Neatsville to Casey county the
road is fine, a large part of it being
graveled, and from the top of the hill
to Columbia or to the terminus of the
new pike is fine nine months in the
year.
If the road is opened on the estab
lished grade on this hill it would af
ford a splendid auto outlet as well as
inlet to a fertile part of this country
as well as to the bluegrass counties of
the State. This work means much to
the upper end of the county, much to
the people along the road and equally
as much to the business interests of
Columbia
All ought to welcome this movement
and all ought to assist. If you can't
join in the work give money other val
uable aid. If the road is opened
on the survey the people directly in
terested will give the gr?,vel.
If Your Motto Be, Lie, Steal,
Drink and Swear.
When you lie, lie down in sweet
slumber; when you steal, steal always
from bad associates; when you drink,
drink nothing but cold water; when you
swear, swear that you will try those
shoes at Albin Hurray's. 49-lt.
The dedication of the Campbells
ville Baptist Church will take place
October 29th. Dr. J. W Porter, edi
tor of the Western Recorder, and pas-tor-of
the First Baptist church of Lex
ington, will preach the Dedicatory
sermon. The neighboring churches in
and out of the Eussell C'reek Associa
tion are cordially invited to attend
the services, and dinner will be served
in the church, basement Campbells

Friday and Saturday. May we have
the pleasure of 'serving you? The
smartest and most exclusive styles at
right prices.

Jeff Jones Indicted for Murder.
It will be remembered that three
weeks ago Frank Holt was killed near
Pellyton, this county, and at the same
time a report gained circulation that
a tree fell on him causing the fatality.
In a day or two parties living in the
neighborhood came to the conclusion
that Holt had been murdered, and it
was also reported that Jeff Jones was
generally suspected as the guilty
party. An investigation was started,
the body being disinterred and an ex
amination made by Drs. C. M, Eussell,
J. S. Miller and L. C. Nelh Their re
port was .submitted to the grand jury,
circuit court being in session, and last
Tuesday an indictment was returned,
charging Jones with murder. His bail
was fixed at 31,500 which, up to this
time, he has failed to furnish. All the
testimony is circumstantial.
Strayed.
From my home near Columbia, a
black boar hog, weight about 130

Georgetown College to coach them
who will also play in the game. The
Lindsey Wilson has been practicing
hardandshbuldbeingoodform. They
have more heavy men than they had

He Likes The News.
My Dear Brother:
We take the liberty to publish your
letter for we get more kicks than pats,
more frowns than smiles, more criti
cisms than praise, and yeb our main
efforts have been and will continue to
be honest, faithful aud'helpful service
to our section of country a land that
needs only the touch of enterprise to
make it bloom a3 the rose.
Your manner cf expression your can
dor and sense of justice for our people,
but honest efforts to serve well those
whe ought to appreciate the News, as
a home paper, bespeak much more
than ordinarily comes to us even from
friends who dwell in the midst and
surroundings of this congenial clime.
May you live long and be happy, and
may we some day enjoy a clasp-of your
hand and have you break bread with
us under our own vine and fig tree, is
our sincere wish.

Adair County News
Enclosed find $1.00 for which please
enter my subscription. If your sub
scription price has raised kindly let
me know on enclosed postal and I will
promptly remit amount necessary for
S year's subscription.
I dropped my subscription to a num
ber of papers last spring, but I am go
ing to come back for your paper. It'
is so full of the simple country life
that I have missed its weekly visits,
although personally, I do not know a
single person in Adair county. But
its news items are about the country
people and country life that I love so
well, and I have come, through one
year's subscription, to know much of
Adair counoy and its good people. No
paper published in any of our large
cities can reach the point ofpicturing
country lifeasjou do.

Red Berkshire.
The red Berkshire sow bought by
the following gentleman, J. W.
Walker, C. G. Jeffries, N. M. Tutt,
A. D Patteson and C. S, Harris, now
has eight beautiful pigs. This is the
first red Berkshire ever brought to
this county and all who have seen her
are highly pleased. It is the purpose
of the buyers to get the best of this
breed of hogs and from the beginning
no one need fear that an inferior .hog
will be purchased. They are now ne
gotiating for a male of merit and later
on will offer to the people of this sec
tion the hog that has so long been
sought the all purpose one, the one
that has the fine texture of nqeat of
the Berkshire, the beauty of the
China and at. prolific as the Duroc.
From Georgia.
Winder, Sept., 30, 1916.
Editor Harris:
We enclose check for two dollars,
which takes us up to May 15, 1917.
according to the statement. We
thoroughly enjoy the News and hope
the high price of paper will in no way
mar, the future of its circulation, as it
seems we could hardly get along so
well without it.
Success to the force.
Yours,
Mrs. Robert J. Pentecost.
The above speaks in tones that we
appreciate and ought to echo from
more than a thousand others who read
The News. The high cost of paper
forces us to advance the subscription
price by a change in form and a re
duction in its size, but as soon as con
ditions permit TJie N.e.ws will appear
in its regular size and form an eight
page six column paper.
Died on. Casey Creek.
Last Friday, the 29th, ulC, Mr. Jesse

Progressing.
A meeting was held in the court
house Jast Saturday and over 3600.00
was subscribed for making the neses
sary surveys for the proposed railroad. -On
Monday this subscription was
raised to 3300 00 It will be necessary
to raise 31,000 more before the work
begins and an effort is now being :
made to secure it If thepeople will '.
give a small amount each to this fund
it will soon be secured and She work " '
started and no one will be hurt even
If we fall to get the road If we .sue- '
ceed in securing the road the amount -subscribed
to the survey will be cred
ited on the amount pledged to the
road. A failure to make the survey
is death to our proposition and every
interested party ought to contribute
to the fund now being raised Only a
few more days will be spent in an ef
fort to secure this money. The busi
ness interests of this county demand
that we make every reaaonable effort
and sacrifice to secure the surveys. If -we
fail in this we lose all that has
already been done.
