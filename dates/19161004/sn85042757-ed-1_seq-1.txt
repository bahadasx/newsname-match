Dr. W. B. Young, of Clifty, was so
enthused over the splendid display of
agricultural products and live stock
shown at the Fair here Friday and Sat
urday that he suggested that a fair as
sociation be formed, ground purchased
and permanent buildings erected. The
idea caught like wild fire and at a
meeting held Saturday night in the
court house nearly SI, 300 was sub
scribed. So enthusiastic were those
present that not a person in the house
tailed to lend assistance by pledging
himself to take some stock.
Dr. W. B. Young was made chairman
of the meeting and S. C. Bishop secre
tary. Dr. V. L. Lewis stated the ob
ject ot the meeting and the prelimi
nary details were at once entered into
tor making the Cumberland county fair
permanent. The name chosen is;
"Cumberland Plateau Fair Associa
tion."
A committee of five was named by
the chair, w ith the understanding that
the chairman and secretary should be
come uoembe 3 of the committee, mak
ing a total c nmittee of seven, whose
duty it shoul.i be to look for a suitable
location for the fair and formulate a
scheme tor organizing tbe fair on a
permanent basis. The committee as a
whole is: J. E. Burnett, Chairman;
S. C. Bishop, Secretary ; Judge C. E.
Snodgrass, Dr. V. L. Lewis, J. B.
Johnson, J. W. Dorton. This commit
tee is to be known as the Organization
Committee.
STCCK COMMITTEE.
Another committee was named that
was called the Stock Committee whose
business it should be to solicit sub
scriptions to the stock of the Cumber
land Plateau Fair Association. It was
decided that the stock should be One
Dollar a share. This committee con
sisted of: G. P. Burnett, Chairman;
S. C. Bishop, Secretary; Jas. Smith,
Prank March, Harry Martin, S. J.
Horn. The meeting then adjourned to
meet at the call of the chairman.
Never before was there so much en
thusiasm shown touching any proposed
enterprise in this county as was in evi
dence at that meeting. It is no exag
geration to say that to Ur. w. a.
Young more than any other person he-
longs the credit for the splendid results
produced. If those who have identified
themselves with the movement will
keep up their enthusiasm and work for
it with the zeal and energy that will
be shown Dy Dr. Young success is sure
to crown the venture.
The idea that was uppermost in the
meeting and the real heart ot the plan
is to make this fair ot such a character
as will take in the entire Plateau sec
tion from Alabama on the south to
Kentucky on the north and confine it,
for the present at least, strictly to the
Plateau. Every indication points to it
being a rousing success. Nothing that
bas been launched in this county will
prove of so much direct benefit to stock
raisers and oarticularly to those who
intend to make blooded stock their ob
ject.

subscribed at the meeting, supplement

Friday and Saturday was in some re
spects ahead of any previous fair held.
Tbe enthusiasm awakened was of such
a strong kind that a movement was put
on toot Saturday to organize a stock
company for a permanent fair. A full
report will be found elsewhere in this
issue. j ,
Thursday a generous rain tell that
laid the dust in good shape. That
night tbe weather turned cold and Fri
day was a cool and threatening day,
which reduced the number of exhibits
in the agricultural display with the re
sult that according to some estimates
it was not quite up to previous ones in
quantity, but the quality of the ex
hibits was very high. Numerous per
sons from a distance made the state
ment that it could not be beaten any
where. One especially marked feature of the
agricultural exhibits was the large in
crease in the corn exhibits. This in
dicated very clearly that our people
are growing more corn than ever be
fore and the time is near at hand when
very little corn will be shipped here.
Even now very many of our best farm
ers buv no grain lor their stock.
The soy bea" exhibit was splendid
both in quality and volume. It showed
very ciparlj that our people ore highly
pleased with that splendid forage crop.
Many farmers were heard to remark
mat uiey would cease to grow cow
pease and grow he soy bean instead
bi-cause it u.aue far more and better
hay than the cw pea.
A movement was also put on foot to
send many of the beet exhibits to
weeks before all arc presented to the
treasurer for payment. In that event;
we may not be able to give a complete
list of the prize winners. Next week,'
however, we hope to be able to give
the most of the names of the winners.

Among the special exhibits Harry
Martin had the most diversified as It
comprized about twenty different pro
ducts all from his farm, which he calls
Lodendale Stock Farm.
Mr. Martin sold a three-quarter blood
Hereford bull calf for S50 and be had
several other Herefords of different
ages on display, all of which eroded
well and in some instances took prizes.
Mr. Martin was chosen manager of the
lair and it is more due to his tireless
work and energy than to any other
person that the fair proved the splen
did success it did.
Juuge C. E. Snodgrass had an excel
lent display of seed corn which he had
grown on his farm hero; the display
took a blue ribbon.
C. E. Brookhart, of Brookside Farm,
had the largest display of apples. Al
fred Hyaer did not have so large a dis
play but his were of such excellent
quality that he won the first prize.
Ur. W. B. Young, of Clifty, brought
a Hereford cow and bull to the fair
which took the blue ribbon. Owing to
the bull belonging to a corporation, the
N. C. and St. L. Railroad, it was ruled
out, but it was of such excellence that
a special premium was awarded. The
cow is now with calf and in event it
should be a male calf it is sold for $150.
The cow belongs to Master William
Kichard Young, son of Dr. W. B.
Young.
Treasurer John Q. Wyatt is now

by C. M. McCIong ft Company, Knox

C. J. Wheeler, Crab Orchard, Sells Gen
eral Store to T. H. Aytes.
Last week C. J. Wheeler sold hie
general store at Crab Orchard to T. H.
Aytes and retired from the mercantile
business after a continnuous service in
that line tor nearly twenty-five years
Two years ago last March Mr. Aytea
sold his business at Crab Orchard to
Reed ft Burnett and they have con
ducted it as a branch to their Cross -ville
business since that time. After
selling Mr. Aytes bought a farm and
did work in the open for his health,
but the lure of the counter was more
than he could satisfactorily stand and
he has again entered the general mer
chandise business. He is a capable and
careful business man and is accredited
with accumulating: several thousand
dollars while engaged in the business
before.
Mr. Wheeler was raised at Crab
Orchard, has a close and intimate ac
quaintance with the people and is high
ly esteemed for his generosity and
general kindness. It is probable that
his over generosity has c st him al
most a small fortune. Ho found it
very hard to refuse a needy person and
tor that reason he was often the loser.
While he may not have accumulated
any large reserve in cash he has won a
place in tbe bearti of the people that
few men have.
Just what business he will engage in
tor the future he has not yet decided.
For the present he will devote his
time to collecting outstanding accounts
and look after his farm, which is a
splendid one lying at Crab Orchard.
