Of a large percentage of faithful
workers these lines are true:
"Somebody said that it couldn't be
done
But he with a chuckle replied,
That maybe it couldn't" but he
would be one
Who wouldn't say no till he tried.
So he buckled right ir., with a
trace of a grin
On his face. If he worried he hid
it.
He started to sing as he tackled
the thing
That couldn't be done, and ho did
it."

CENTREVILLE NOTES
The Community Fair held in Cen
treville la t week was a big success,
and every one is looking forward to
the next fair, tho they know it is
a long ways off.
The people of Centreville hired a
truck Saturday, and built a platform
on it. They divided this platform in
to three booths for fancy work. A
trailer was attached to the truck and
carried the best of our hogs and
farm products to the Teche Fair.
Everyone that saw it was well pleas
ed and the New Iberia people were
so hospitable and complimentary
that we thought that we had great
sucess.
Mr. Albert Hubert has developed
variety of corn which took the
first prize at the Teche Fair.
Two hundred people of Centre
ville visited the Teche *Fair Sunday.
Thursday night a crowd of school
children who were accompained by
the teachers, attended the Prohibi
tion Lecture given in Franklin that
night.
Miss Josie Milbournc has been
(pirated on for appendicitis and is
doing ricelv. Miss Louise Alleman is
filling her place.
