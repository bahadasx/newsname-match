LET US HAVE
DOCK PEACE
Peace or war on the waterfront—which shall it be '
Highly per cent of the longshoremen's union voted
for peace. I hey voted on a proposition submitted by
Capt. Gibson, president of the Waterfront limployers'
union. I hey voted to return to work at present wage
schedule and to take up by arbitration a new wage
Schedule.
Ihe longshoremen, who voted for peace, had a
right to believe that the employers would go thru
with their proposition. ' /
But now Capt. Gibson declares it's all off. Ik
talks war, war, war. He wants t,cmh» special deputy
sheriffs.
It's all off with his own proposition for peace be
cause, forsooth, a few irresponsibles clashed on the
waterfront Monday. A few strikers—not the So per
cent who voted for peace—and a few strikebreakers,
met and battled.
Is the peace of the community to he the play
thing ot a few hotheads and irresponsibles? Or shall
the 8o per cent of the longshoremen and cooler heads
among the dock employers control?
For it is the peace of the whole community that
is involved. Just now the waterfront alone is affected,
but all organized labor is watching keenly to sec it the
longshoremen's union, trusting to the word of the em
ployers and voting for peace by such an overwhelming
majority, is going to g«u a square deal.
Once again, the question might well be asked:
Of what avail is it to talk of unity for the purpose of
capturing Russian and Oriental trade when at
home we are torn by needless strife?
Cooler heads in organized lab«>r have secured
a reasonable attitude among the longshoremen.
Now it is up to men like Samuel Hill, who is so
prominent before the public eye today in his eagerness
for city unity, and Judge Burke, and other leading
business men, to call for a reasonable attitude also
in Capt. Gibson and the dock owners.
Peace was almost at hand, when the fracas of
Monday night occurred on the waterfront.
But that was the fault of only a few individuals.
Is the peace of the waterfront—and of Seattle—
to be sacrificed for a few individual hotheads?
killed off by any mere whim of an
Individual.
"When the water front employers
take things In their hands, and do
some of their own thinking, there
won't be any trouble about ending
the atrlke by honest arbitration
"I am even Inclined to believe
that the riot of Monday night might
have been purposely staged no as
to furnish an excuse for preventing
an amicable settlement."
Sheriff Hodge Is going to take
the policing of the water front
strike zone into his own hand*
He announced Wednesday shortly
before noon that he ha/I already
sent a large squad of his regular
deputies to the water front, and
that he would hive several squads
of special deputies before nightfall
Sheriff Hodge was In conference
Wednesday morning with repre
sentatlves of the Muslness Men's
association,
"It I* plain to be seen that the
city can't or won't rope with the
situation." he said, "and I won't
stand for any more lawlessness.
It's un-American. and If I never do
anything else. I'm going to preserve
order."

late coronation ceremonies has
led to Seattle, and developed
Into bold counter charges. In
volving Japanese of high
standing and financial power,
It was revealed Wednesday.
The tangle of affairs has re
sulted in a run on two Jap
anese banks, and charges of
malicious slander against 8.
Kuwabara, editor of the Asahl
News here. This paper print

nection between the blackmail
letters and the influential Jap

The thr< atn of violence. It It al

Consul Recalled
The rec«nt, sudden recall of Im
perial Consul Sellchl Takabashi, It
In believed, is a result of the ia
volved charges, and rounte
charges, brought to light thru the
Japanese government iuvestlca
tlon into the case.
A-cordln 5 to the Japanese pui&,
a series of six letters was sen:
from Seattle to members of fh"
Japanese cabinet In 1913, warnln;;
tnein that acts of violence woulii
be directed against the emperor,
and members of the coronation
profession.
A itersnn or persons from the
Pacific Coast—a member of one ol
the many home-coming excursion
parties, would commit the assault,
each letter explained.
Japan Investigate*
The government immediate!?
started investigation, aud Consul
Takahashi finally received orders
stating that the home-going parties
would not be permitted to return
to Japan 'or the coronation.
The Aiuhl News, in Its publish
ed accounts of the tangle, has
pointed out that the home-gotof
partlis would have resulted In sap
ping the deiioslts of Japanese
banks In the Pacific Northwest,
and that the bankers hatched th»
plot to check the exodus.
It also stated that powerful UpS
fluences were being brought to ptav
against Imperial investigation of
the threat letters.
Prosecutor on Job

mers. who is handling the slander
case, explained Monday that F. Ota.
said to be a Japanese gambler and
cannery man. was put aboard a
Japanese ship.

al>oard by force, on the allegation
that he was the writer of the black
mail letters
lie is now being held in jail at
Yokohama.
Thft Japanese newspaper Intimat
ed that local Japanese hankers
caused Ota to write the letters, to
prevent the exodus to Japan.
It Is charged that local Japanese
withdrew about 1150.000 In deposits
from the Oriental American and the
Japanese Commercial banks here,
following the nubllcation of the
stories concerning the efforts to
