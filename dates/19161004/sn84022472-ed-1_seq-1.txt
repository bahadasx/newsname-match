ISBETi ESTATE
The will of Merrlman M. Isbel has
1een offered for probate. The estate
Is about $200. Nellie Mooney of this
City and Milden M. label of Pittsfleld,
Children, are the heirs.
As a result of the formation of the
Western Connecticut Milk Producers'
association, dealers in Bridgeport and
surrounding towns- may have to buy
their milk from a central distributing
plant, where every quart may be pas
teurized. The association has appointed a
committee composed of William -C.
Johnson, of Newtown, A. G. Barrett,
Jr., of Redding and E. F. Hartwell
of New Milford to inquire Into the ad
visability of establishing such a plant
The committee will visit plants ', In
Providence and Poughkeepsie.
Seventy-five producers already have
pledged 1,000 pounds of milk dally
each, in the event that the plant is
decided, upon. Seyenty-five others are
expected to partonize the plant
The decision of the Bridgeport
health department regarding pasteur
ized milk, if enforced, will mean that
the producers and dealers will have
to hustle to make some arrangements
for selling, the required standard of
milk. If it is not, it is believed, a cen
tral distribution plant win be desir
able anyway to standardize the price
of milk. A location for such a plant
is to be sought by the committee.
It is pointed out that if one dealer
buys for three cents a quart, his neigh
bor who pays four is at a disadvan
tage. Both the prices of buying and
selling, it is expected, will be stan
dardized. J. A. Sherwood of Easton Is presi
dent of the association; I M. Dickin
son of Roxbury, vice-president; C. F.
Nichols of Easton, secretary; E. F.
Hartwell, New Milford, treasurer.
The by-laws and constitution of the
association are now in the hands of

NASHVILLE ROAD
MUST REPORT ON
CAMPAIGN GIFTS
Court Orders That Officials
Answer L C. C. Questions
on Funds.
Washington, 'Oct 4 Justice Staf
ford of the District of Columbia su
preme court, rendered a decision to
day requiring Milton H. Smith, presi
dent and other officials of the Louis
ville & Nashville Railroad to answer
questions propounded by the Inter
state Commerce Commission regard
ing its political contributions.
The court held the commission has
the rlght to know about such contri
butions, not because of their political
nature, but because they affect ques
tions of the reasonableness of rates
and important questions of railroad
accounting.
Mr. Smith refused several months
ago to answer questions of Joseph W.
Folk, counsel for the commission, in
an Inquiry Into the affairs of the
Louisville & Nashville, Chattanooga &
St. Louis railroads based upona senate
resolution. A series of questions deal
ing with alleged political contributions
was submitted and approved by Chair
man Mayer of the commission and un
answered by Mr. Smith on the advice
of his counsel.
Recourse to the courts was had by
the commission and both sides pre
sented briefs and argued the merits
orally. The railroad denied the exist
ence of broad authority and asserted
the investigation was inspired for
political reasons.

distribution companies in an effort to
bring about a settlement of the dif
ferences 'between the companies and
the dairymen's league over the price
of milk failed of result, according to
an unofficial announcement after, the
meeting adjourned.
John J. Dillon, the state commis
sioner of foods and markets, has of
fered to waive a recognition of the
Dairymen's League and permit the
distributors to mate individual con
tracts with the farmers. Mr. Dillon
Insisted, however, that the distribu
tors pay the price demanded by the
farmers -4.67 cents a quart for milk
containing 3.5 per cent of butter fat.
The concession offered by Mr. Dil
lon was obtained through' the media
tion of Mayor Mitchel. Heretofore
the farmers have insisted that distri
butors could buy only through the
agency of Mr. Dillon as representative
of their league.
Meanwhile, the city is receiving
only one-half of Its normal supply
and the situation is approaching a
famine stage. Milk dealers asserted
today that they would be able to in
crease their distribution by receipt of
milk from other than the usual
sources, but those directing the freight
of the farmers claimed that no more
than 25 to 30 per cent of the regular
supply was being received.
Farmers in all the dairy sections of
New York state and northern New
Jersey continued to turn their milk
to butter and cheese or to dump along
side the roads milk that dairymen at
tempted to take to stations for deliv
ery in. this city.
"With a suit of milk on their hands,
producers have been turning the sup
ply Into butter and ice cream. Farm
ers who have separators make their
barns the headquarters for the neigh-'
borhood and the milk is carried to a
central depot

m .
Frank Schirmmer Dies of
Fractured Skull in St.
Vincent's Hospital. '
As a result of the death of Frank
Schirmmer, aged 30, of New Haven,
struck by the automobile driven by A.
J. Riker, Jr., on the night of Sept
23, at Ash Creek, a coroner's Inquest
has been .recommended by Acting
'Medical Examiner Edward A. FItz
gerald.
Schirmmer, who 'had suffered a
fracture of the right thigh and was
immediately admitted to St Vincent's
hospital after the accident, developed
septicaemia and although he was the
subject of operations by Dr.- Charles
C. Godfrey and other noted surgeons,
science was no avail and death oc
curred yesterday morning.
Young Riker, who was apprehended
at the time of the accident for not
having a driver's license, was fined $5
and costs when arraigned in the city
court, Sept. .25. He has not since
been apprehended upon the technical
charge of manslaughter customarily
preferred by the police in cases where
death results and it is believed that
on account of his high connections
such action will be waived by the au
thorities pending the inquest, which
will be held by Coroner Phelan at an
early date. .
Investigation 'by Acting Medical Ex
aminer Fitzgerald discloses that the
death of Schirmmer came as a result
of the automobile accident. A report
to this effect was submitted to Cor
oner Phelan this morning, but owing
to his absence from the city on other
matters the coroner has not as yet
set a date for hearing. .
Police investigation of the case
tended to show that Mr. Riker was
driving In from Ash Creek, Saturday
night, Sept. 23, when the New Haven
man stepped off a car and directly
into the path of the autocobile.

DENIED BY PERRITT
Fletcher Also Backs' Up
Pitcher's Defense of
Team Mates.
New York, Oct 4. The National
Commission will take no action on the
statement made by Manager John Mc-
Graw, of the New York Giants, that
his team pjayed listless .ball in the
game yesterday when Brooklyn easily
defeated the Giants and captured the
National league championship. Pres
ident John K. Tener of the National
league said today that the commission
would mot take any cognizance of Mc
Graw"s remarks. . . ,
"McGraw was undoubtedly wrought
up over the fact that his team could
not keep on winning," said President
Tener. "The Giants were suffering
from the reaction, of their long win
ing streak. I don't doubt that Mc
Graw said harsh things hut every
friend of baseball will realize the fiery
temper of the man who said them."
Manager M-qGraw could not be found
today to amplify his remarks which
he made shortly after he left the
Giants' bench in anger during the fifth
Inning of the game yesterday. Art
Fletcher, the shortstop, and "Poll"
Perritt asserted that the New York
team played the best they knew how.
Captain Jake Daubert, of the Brook -lyns,
says that Fletcher told him be
fore the game 'that while he might
like to see him win the Giants were
out to win the game, if possible,
Manager Robinson, of the Brook
lyn s, an old friend of McGraw, said he
could! not understand what could have
prompted MGraw's remarks unless he
was angry "over the fact that the
Brooklyns were beating the Giants.

the theft of nearly $10,000 worth of

It is believed, however, that Liquor
Prosecutor A. E. Merritt, whom they

superior court without the taking of
testimony in city court.
It is understood that when the case
is called for disposition 'in the higher
court, Nathaniel Wright who has con
fessedaccording to the police his
guilt of the crime, will plead guilty to
the charge, assuming all blame for
the offence in an effort to save his
brother from prison and disgrace and
thus give him an opportunity to he of
further service to the local political

SEEK TO ACQUIRE
CONTROL OF LONG
HILL'S TUNGSTEN
German Interests Said to b
Behind Firm Trying to
Buy Property.
German Interests are believed today
to be behind prospective purchase of:
the Long Hill mines, which Through
a series of leases and sub-leases, at
tempts at capitalization and a disas
trous fire have become deeply invol
ved' In litigation.
It became known today that re
spective interests in the ownership and
leasehold of the mine have been of
fered favorable terms and a guaran
tee .by Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co..'
that at least $100,000 will be paid for
the re-equipping of a tungsten plant,
if trustees of the conflicting Interests
can be induced to sign a suitable lease.
Those interested In the property
here are Ell C. Beach of Stratford,
owner of the property, the Long Hill
Quarries Co., operating under a lease
and the American Electrical Equip
ment Co of New Jersey, sub-lessees.
Melville E. Gray of New York and
Spottswood D. Bowers were recently'
apointed trustees to attempt a solu
tion of the legal tangle into which the
property had been thrown.
The trustees have recently submit
ted proposals for a new lease of the
property upon .conditions submitted
hy the big German banking firm of
New York. These are now being ten
tatively discussed, though the names
if the persons interested are not di
vulged by the bankers acting as
agents.
-Tungsten Is -used largely In the
hardening of steel,' It enters largely
