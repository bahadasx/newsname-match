LIQUOR CASE GOES
UPON APPEAL TO
TEST"INDIAN"LAW
Washington, Oct 4.Early deter
mination by the supreme court of
whether railroads may be required
to trr/sport liquor into a large sec
tion of Minnesota, in which the gov
ernment is seeking to prohibit the
traffic i the ground that it is "In-
dian country," is requested in an ap
peal on file. The court has been
asked to advance for hearing a test
case of a Milwaukee brewing com
pany against the government and the
Great Northern Railway company,
which refused shipments of beer.
The territory involved, formerly
the Chippewa Indian reservation,
embraces 17,000 square miles, an
area equal to the four states of Mas
sachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware
and Connecticut, and has 500,000
white inhabitants It includes the
cities of Brainerd, Grand Rapids, Co
hasset and Bemidji
The land was ceded to the Chip
pewas in 1855 and, although most of
it has since passed into private own
ership and fed Indians remain there,
the government has barred liquor
traffic on the ground that the ter
ritory still remains "Indian coun
try" in which congress has ordered
no liquor shall be sold.
That the district is no longer
"Indian country" and that no Federal
laws prohibit the shipment thereto
of beer or other unfermented liquor,
especially that bought outside of
Minnesota for the private consump
tion, was* ineffectually contended by
the brewing company in the Minne

its suit, the present appeal to the
