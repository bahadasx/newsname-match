on the Somme front over a forty five kilometer front

kilometers (about eight and one-half miles.)
In the early days of the offensive the allied attacks
were delivered on a front extending from a point north
of the Albert-Bapaume highway to a point north of
Chaulnes. The capture last week of Thiepval extended
the British attack almost to the Ancre brook. The French
reached south of Chaulnes and captured the village of
VMy.
A heavy rain that hindered operations for two days
ceased falling yesterday noon and artillery began tuning
up, particularly south of the river..
North of the Somme the French last night completed
the conquest of a German trench between Mo'rval and
St. Pierre Vaast wood, taking two hundred prisoners.
South of the river, there was a violent bombardment in
the region of Belloy-En-Santerre but no important in
fantry fighting.

the result still in doubt.
At the same time, the fighting in Dob

Are Forced to Witlttfaw,
Berlin. Oct. 4. The Rumanian force
that crossed the Danube and invaded
Bulgaria has been forced to withdraw
in hasty flight, it was officially -an
nounced this afternoon.
Attacked on three sides by German
and Bulgarian troops and threatened
with envelopment, the Rumanians re
treated. The crossing had been made near
Rjasovo, the Rumanians using trans
ports and pontoon bridges. Teutonic
monitors destroyed one of the pontoons,
endangering the Rumanians line of sup
plies. Meanwhile Bulgar and Germnn
forces approached on both flauks and
on the front.
Tinned back against the river, the
Rumanians were threatened with a repe
tition of the disaster at Tutrukan,
where 23.000 Rumanian troops were
trap)ed on tho south bank of the
Danube and captured while hundreds
were drowned trying to swim the river.
The Gennan-Bulgnr encircling move
ment thus brought to an enW the first
invasion of Bulgaria, widely heralded in
the allied press as the beginning of a
great campaign to flank Mnckensen out
of lifthrudjn,
In Transylvania, Rumanian attacks in !
the Gorgenv valley were fruitless but
the Rumanians obtained succeses west
of Parnjd.
In Macedonia, the Germans and Bui
gars withdrew to new positions on their

Tho war office admitted at the same
time, that "considerable units" of Ru
manians crossed the Danube and invad
ed Bulgaria before Bulgarian monitors
destroyed a pontoon bridge
The river was bridged by the enemy
near Kiahovo.
Bulgarian artillery has stopped the
enemy's offensive on the Hesaul-Amza
eea-l'erveli line.
A previous official statement from
the Bulgarian war office said that Hu
manian troops were transported across
the Danube in boats. Apparently after
the first force was transported in this
manner pontoon were thrown across
the river and reinforcements passed in
to Bulgaria.

SOLVING M PROBLEM

' Headquarters American-M e x 1 e a n
Joint Commission, Hotel Trayinore, At
lantic City, N. J., Oct. 4. It may be
unwelcome news to certain bandits and
Mexicans who have been living off the
fight, ra her than the fat of tho land,
but there is a scheme on to put Mexi
co to work.
The committee of mining men, who
conferred with the Americaii-Mexicau
peace commissioners alike the past two
days, saw tho Mexican group again to
day. Theso sessions are the basis for
the work idea. The mining men are
going over the tax situation of Mexi
co, tho railroad problem, and gonoral
plans for putting Mexico's working ma
chinery back into order and for sub-
stitutinir use of nick nud shovel for
the rifle and sabre as a national pas-'
time.
The American commissioners have
served notice that the United States
cannot guarantee returns of Americans
to tho mining districts until the safe
ty of life and property is assured
which may be interpreted to mean that
whilo Carranza S complaining about
withdrawal of American troops, it is
up to him to get control of the inter
ior districts whero idle mines are lo
cated. While Cnrranza is still insisting on
early withdrawal of the Pershing fore
os in any discussion of border patrol
it is denied that he has made any threat
to recall his commissioners if there is
no compliance.

A Jap Newspaper Recently
Said, "If Named He Would
Invade China"
Tokio, Oct. 4. Field Mnrshal Te
rauchi has been appointed prime minis
ter, succeedinig Marquis Okuma, who
resigned yesterday.
Count Marshal Terauchi, the new
Japanese premier holds the highest
rank in the Japanese army and until
his appointment to the premiership to
day was governor general of Korea.
Terauchi, a fighting man - strongly
supported by Japanese leaders favoring
a strong military policy, is understood
to have been the candidate of the up
per house of tho Japanese parliament.
He has been described by writers as
the champion of an aggressive expan
sionist policy, particularly with refer
ence to China. One Jaanese newspaper
declared recently that if Terauchi ever
succeeded Okuma as prime minister, it
would not be long before a Japanese
army was on the road to Peking.
As Washington Sees It
Washington, Oct. 4. The appoint
ment of Count Marshall Terauchi, pre
mier of Japanese, is an effort of the
emperor to pick a niau who wifl win
tho support of the political factions of
Japan and put an end to the bitter
party strife of tuo past lew years, ac
cording to Japanese officials here to
day.
Terauchi, being a military man, it
was said, belongs to no party and there
fore is in a eood position to win sup
port of al factions. - It is expected
that he will name a coalition cabinet
The efforts being made to bitrmon
ize the political groups in Japan, is
said to be for tlie purjiosc or geuing

ernment on the three big questions of
tho day; Japan's relations with tho
United States, her relations wun i ni
nn nn.l the uiicstion of taxation for
the maintenance and increase of her
army and navy.
Terauchi 's attitude toward the east
ern issues is not definitely known by
Japaneno officials here, they said.
Speaking of his future stand on the
Jupancse immigration and land ques
tion with the I'nited States, they said,
however, that Terauchi had a reputa
tion in Japun for extreme caution re

Motto On Menu Card: "It Is

Dwell Together in Unity
By J. P. Toder: '
(Uuited Press' staff correspondent.)
New York', Oct. 4. Strains from the
ex-presidents harmony duet still cloyed
the atmosphere around republican head
quarters today. William H. Taft and
Theodore Roosevelt had met shaken
hands AND spoken.
'1 wo years ago they met at a funeral.
Lost night it was a sort of christening
bee. The christening was "harmony."
The Union League club waa the chris
tening spot. Wo mere reporters were
permitted to desecrate the scene bnt
Roosevelt aud Taft did shake hands.
They both asked "How'd you do," but .
neither answered the question. There
was not any one who heard any "Dear
W ill " or " Dear Theodore ' ' stuff. The
two merely nodded, Taft stuck his hand
cut. Roosevelt grabbed it, gave it one
up and down pump and dropped it. Then
the' two, with Chauncey M. Dcpcw
standing between them stood in line
while all the big republicans in New -York
City passed along behind open
faced suits and with outstretched hand
tliat itched to be shaken by two former
presidents and a would-be president
lie was-Charles Hughes on the same '
night.,, - -" ... .
Tart Meets Teaay.
That much Is agreed today by every
one who was inside, while the reporters
were kept outside, looking in.
As to just who got the colonel and
Judge Taft together there is difference
of opiniou. Taft arrived before Roose
velt and had taken his place in liua
when, Roosevelt shaking hands right
and left appeared. Some say Governor
Whitman hooked his arm through the
colonel's, led him over to Taft and said:
"Mr.. Taft hem's Colonel Roosevelt."
Some say George R. NicUlunr'llid tha
deed. f '
At any rate that's all there was to
it insofar as Taft and Roosevelt were
concerned. Some said they were cordial.
Others said neither smiled. This later
was refuted by still others who said
it would have been physically impos
sible fur either to keep from grinning.
But there were other little high spot
that made) it almost as interesting as
if the colonel aad Taft hail hugged each,
other. For instance when Roosevelt got
in the elevator, who should have been
crowded against him but W, Murray
Crane, who is said to have accumulat
ed as ninny unsaid words as he has
dollurs. The two spoke but Roosevelt
alone spoke nbove a whisper. When ha
suid his howdy-do, Crane leaned rare
fully over to the colonel's ear some
say it was the colonel's right ear, others
the left and moved his lips. Roosevelt,
according to eye witnesses, pretended to
hear Crnne and iu turn leaned to Crane'
ear. His lips moved. Crnne smiled.
nodded his head and once more whisper
ed hi Kooscvelt's car. xtoosevoit suiueu.
That was all of that.
Barnes Crowded Away.
Then Roosevelt ran against Kliha
Hoot, who guided Taft's "tank" at
Chicago in 11112. Iloth smiled broadly, .
and shook hunds. This act brought much,
hu bi 7.z of approval aud some hand
clapping. There isn't liny more of
that.
But Jhe incident no one forgot to men
