Taft and Teddy Shake Ha&ds
ssd Renew the Friendship
Thai Formerly Existed (Be
tween the Ex-Presidects
New York, Oct. 4. Strain from
the x-presldeats' harmony duet still
cloyed the atmosphere around repub
lican headquarters today. William
H, Taft and Theodore Roosevelt had
met shaken hands and spoken.
Two rears ago they met at a tun
era!. Last night It wss a sort of
christening bee. The ohrlstenee was
"Harmony." The Union League club
was the spot No mere reporters
were permitted to desecrate the scene
but
Roosevelt and Tart did shake hands.
They both asked "Howdy do?" but
neither answered the question. There
was not any one who heard any
"Dear Will" or "Dear Theodore"
tuff. The two merely nodded, Taft'
tuck bis hsnd out. T. R. grabbed It,
gave It one up-and-down pump and
dropped It. Then the two, with
Chaunrey M. Depew standing between
them, stood In line, while all the big
republicans pot!, behind open-faced
suits and with out-stretched hands
that Itched to be shsken by the two
former presidents and a would-be
president Cherles K. Hughes on
the ssme night.
That much Is sgreed todsy by
every one who was Inside, while the
reporters were kept outside, looking
In.
As to Just who got the colonel and
Judge Taft together there Is differ
ence of opinion. Taft arrived before
Roosevelt and had taken his plaoe la
line when Roosevelt, shaking hands
right and left, appeared. Some ssy
Governor Whitman hooked his arm
.through the colonel's, led him over
to Taft, and said: "Mr. Tart, here's
Colonel Roosevelt."
Some say George R. Sheldon did
the deed.
At any rate, that's all there was to
It In so far as Taft and Roosevelt
were concerned. Some say they were
cordial; others aald neither smiled.
This latter was refuted by still others,'
who said It would have been physi
cally Impossible for either to keep
from grinning.
But ther were other little high
pots that made It almost as Interest
ing as It the colonel and Taft had
bugged each other. For , Instance,
when Roosevelt got In the elevator
' who should have been crowded
against him but W. Murray Crane,
who Is said to have accumulated as
many unsaid words as he hat dol
lars. The two spoke hut Roosevelt
alone spoke above a whisper, Whon
he said his "howdy do," Crane leaned
carefully over to the colonel's ear
some say It wss the oolonol's right
ear, others the loft and moved his
Hps. Roosevelt, according to eye wit
nesses, protended to hear Crane and,
In turn, loaned to Crane's ear. His
lips moved, Crane smiled, nodded
his head, and once more whispered
In Roosevelt's oar. T. R. smiled.
That wss all or that.
Then Roosevelt ran against Ellhu
Root, who guldod Tsft's "tank" at
Chicago In 1911. Tloth smiled broad
ly and shook hnnds. This act brought
much Imax-tnirt or approval, and some
haml-dupplng, There Is not any
more or that,

mention whon tho news-hungry re
porters wero Mug tossed tho official

BASEBALL L1AGHATE LOSES TEMPER
AND TROUBLE BREVS IN NAT. LEAGUE
New York, Oct. 4. President John
K. Tener, ot the National league, de
clared to the United Press today that
absolutely nothing will be done from
his office regarding the charges ot
Manager John McOrsw that the
Giants quit In yesterday' game with
Brooklyn. Governor Tener'a declara
tion followed an assertion by Garry
Herrmann, president of the national
commission, that the matter had been
laid to rest ss far as th commission
was concerned.
"it look to me Ilk an outburst
from a man wrought up over the fact
that he could not keep on winning
with a team which had just finished
a run of It oonsecutiv victories,"
Tener said.
"I do not doubt that he said harsh
things, but every friend of baseball
who knows the national game will at
tribute It to the fiery temper ot the
man who said It There Is nothing
to be done from this office."
Tener expressed regret over the
fact that so much fuss hsd been made
over a matter that appeared to htm
to be of very slight Importance.
Herrmann Insisted he did not see
why the national commission should
take up the matter. '
"There Is no case to close, so far
as tho commission Is concerned," he
declared. "I don't want to talk about
It."
Ran Johnson, president ot the
American league, did not comment
on the occurrence, saying It was not
his place to become Involved In a con
troversy In which he did not have any
Interest at the present time.
McQrnw himself could not be lo
cated early today, nor could Harry N.

Oct 4. It may be unwelcome news
to certain bandit and Mexicans who
hare been living off the fight rather
than tb fat of the land, but there Is
a scheme on to put Mexico to work.
The committee of mining men who
conferred with the American-Mexican
peace commissioner during the past
two day saw the Mexican group
again today. These sessions are the
bull for the work idea. The mining
men are going over the tax situation
of Mexico, the railroad problem, and
general plan for putting Mexico'
working machinery back Into order
and for substituting use ot the pick
snd shovel for the rifle and sabre ss
a national pastime.
The American commissioners hsve
served notice that the United States
can not guarantee reborn of Ameri
cans to the mining districts until the
safety ot life and property is assured
which may be Interpreted to mean
that while Carranaa I complaining
about withdrawal of American troops,
