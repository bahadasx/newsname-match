and that's the kind of man we cater to.
The New Peoria Drill is without a doubt
the most complete farm machine of its
kind on the market today, and we want
you to see it. It opens the furrow, drops
the seed at the bottom, and brings you a
better and bigger yield.
Don't forget the name, "New Peoria,"

BIG EXPLOSION
Of flu In the Mew York Store Yettter
da) Morning limit It O'clock
Causes Small Fire and a Great
Vim. mil i.f Fright.
A gas explosion in the New York
Mian yesterday morning about 11
o'clock caused a small lire and a great
deal of excitement on the part of the
tlirks and passersby.
Several days ago a gas stove was
placed in the store and the connec
tions were found to be faulty. A
piumber was called yesterday morn
ing to tlx the leak and he started down
in the cellar the gas whichj had col
lected in the store ignited In some
manner and exploded. The force ot
the explosion was terrillic. but. al
though the store was tilled with cus
tomers and clerks, no one was in
jured. Merchandise wus thrown from
the counters and seeial windows and
door glasses shattered by the force ot
the explosion. The glass in the front
doors was blown across the street.
One lady fainted from the shock.
Mr, William SaniinoiiH, llie plumber,
was entirely uninjured. It 1b thought
that when he opened the door lcadiiiy
to the cellar the draft blew the tire so
as to catch the gas.
The damage to the stock of goods in
the store and to the windows, etc.,
will amount to about )4uu according to
an estimate by .Mr. Straus, the niaii
Rgsjf of the store. A small fire occur
red immediately following the explo
sion and the tire department wus call
ed out. They extinguished it without
delay.
