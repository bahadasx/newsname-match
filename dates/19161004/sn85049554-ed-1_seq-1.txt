Berlin,, via London, Oct. 4,.—The
campaign against Chancellor von
Bethmann Hollweg is dally assuming
a more) tangible form. A circular de
mandlng retirement of the chancellor,
has been sent by a vociferous
group of his opponents to such mem
bers of the reichstag as are consid
ered open to their arguments. Attacks
are made on the chancellor's attempts
to reach an agreement with Bngland
and his policy In the submarine Issue.
The only name o( International promi
nence among the signers is Ernest
H^eckel's and the' circular Is regarded
as symptomatic rather than serious.
Another factor which is disturbing
the political situation Ik a breach of
the political truce proclaimed at the
outset of the warywhich has been made
by the Saxon socialists.
Meanwhile the chancellor and the
reichstag leaders diBcuss the points at
issue behind closed doors.

Allies Claim Riperves Have
Been Used Up on West
era Front
London, Oct. 4.—An official state
ment issued here today gives details of
the fighting on the Somme front after
the advance of Sept. 15, describing the
capture of villages Including "Combles,
Gueudecourt and Thlepval, and pro
ceeds.
"The enemy has fought stubbornly
to check our advance, and since Sept
15 seven new divisions have been
brought against us and five against
the French. The severe and prolonged
struggle demanded on the part of our
troops very great determination and
courage. At the end of September the
situation may be summarized as fol
lows:
"Since the opening of the battle on
July 1 we have taken 2-6,735 prisoners
and engaged thirty-eight German di
visions, of which twenty-nine, *bout
350,000 men, have been withdrawn, ex
hausted or broken.
"We hold the half moon upland
south of Ancre, occupy every height of
importance, and so have direct obser
vation ground to the east and north
east The enemy has fallen back upon
the fourth line, behind a low ridge,
just west of the Bapaume-Transloy
road.
"The importance of the threo months
offensive Is not to be Judged by the
distance advanced nor the number of
enemy trenches taken. It must be
looked for in the effect upon the en
emy's strength in numbers, material
and morale. The enemy has used his
reserves In .repeated costly and unsuc
cessful counter attacks without caus
ing our allies or ourselves to relax our
methodical pressure."

Somme Front.Oct 4.—CBVoni,a staff
correspondent of thp Associated press)
—How Chlllr was token from the Ger
mans in'one brilliant dash by French
regiments wis related today to a cor
respondent of the Associated press,
when he visited that position.
The'artillery preparation was unre
lenting, lasting for two days. Scarcely
even the foundation of a wall remain
ed standing at Chilly, where the Ger
mans had masked their strength under
ground.
Then the French, who had assembl
ed in the most advanced dugouts,
dashed out. The first wave cleared
the German front line, in -which Ger
mans had retaken their. plac«S after
the artillery had ceased to fire, and
they were, able to emerge from their
burrows. They were all killed or cap
tured.
The wave of French then partly
crept and partly ran to the second
German line and the second wave

first German line.
Bayonet Fighting.
Meanwhile, from somewhere under
ground, a large body of XSMrmana came
between, with machine guns and gren
ades. The French hesitated, but were
not stayed. They bayoneted some of
the Germans, the rest of whom disap
peared into a tunnel.
The Frenchmen built a sand hag re
doubt around the tunnel, and waited.
The first French wave went on and
took the second and third German
lines within Chilly Itself.
Then the tunnel again began to dis
gorge German troops, whose exit was
brought to an end by a French detach
ment
Germans of an unknown number
were still in the tunnel in the rear. For
eighteen hours they held out until a
captured Gorman was sent In to tell
them their line had been passed. More
than 400 men and- ten officers were,
thus captured.
Comfort tfndsr Ground.
The Associated Press corre
spondent today went thru the tunnel,
which is nearly 1,000 yards in length,
with an 18-inch railroad track running
from beginning tov end.
.v Inside were sleeping quarters, muni-,
tlon depots, an infirmary with the
most modern instruments^ fresh water
wells, Ions of equipment, electric lights
and ventilation pipes.
The entrance "of the tunnel was
toward Mauscourt the exit in the cen
ter of. Chilly, where wAs found the
Gennan commandant's apartments qf
several rooms, with painted wal'-'
solid doors, chairs, tables, beds' and a
telephone system. This position now
Is In the hands of the French.

Cleveland, O., Oct. 4.—The death
list in last night's bridge tragedy In
which two street cars plunged thirty
feet from a viaduct to the Baltimore
and Ohio railroad tracks, remained at
two today. Of the sixty injured it was
expected one or two will die. Two in
vestigations are under way today, one
by city officials and the other by the
Cleveland Railway Company!
Conflicting testimony was available
as to the cause of the accident. Some
claimed a southbound runaway car
was derailed and collided with a north
bound car the foRM of the crash caus
ing the bridge to grumble.
Two street cars came together on
the West Third street bridge causing
it to collapse. Sixty passengers'were
plunged thirty feet to the Baltimore
and Ohio railway tracks below.
From the railway tracks the two
cars almost rolled ,4nto the Cnyahoga
river.

The accident occurred when a south
bound Scranton road car carrying a
crowd of women shoppers home at the
rush hour broke away from the motor
man on a hill approaching the bridge
and tore dorfn the north approach to
the bridge Just as a northbound car
reached the same point The runaway
car jumped the track and struck the
northbound car. The combined
weight-of the two cars and the shock
of the collision was too much for the

Sistera and Then Sent One Home.
Lexington, Ky., Oct. 4.—In a battle
fought from behind rocks trees and
fences near Bagdad, a village In Shelby
county yesterday afternoon, Roy Dick
son, kidnaper of 42-year-old Cath
erine Methig, was shot dead by a posse
headed by Sheriff Jacob Smith.
About fifty shots were fired and
Dlckeon was struck by several bullets.
None of the offioers was injured. The
little girl witnessed the fight
Monday Dickson disappeared with
Catherine and her 6-year-old sister.
Later In the day the smaller girl re
turned home and said that Dickson had
taken her sister "into a big house"
had put her In a wagon and sent her
home. The family Immediately raised
an algrm and police of several coun
ties took the trail.
Dickson's object In kidnaping the
children Is a mystery, as the Methig
family is not wealthy enough for a
child profitably to be held for ransom,
and there had never been any enmity
between the families. The little girl
says she was not harmed In the least.
