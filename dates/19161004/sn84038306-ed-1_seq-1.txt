STOP, LOOK AND LISTEN.
Owing to the ever increasing num-1
ber of automobile accidents at grade
crossings, T. J. Foley, general man
ager of the Illinois Central railway
company, h%s issued a warning to all
drivers of cars. Many of these acci
dents are due to carelessness on the
part of auto drivers, many drivers
attempting to get across the tracks
before an oncoming' yain reaches the
crossing.
The railroad companies^ are now
engaged In a campaign to educate
the users of cars to stop, look and
listen before crossing railway tracks
at grades.
Following is the note of warning
by Mr. Foley:
"The constantly increasing num
ber of automobile accidents at grade
crossings prompts the issuance of
this warning to all who own, drive
or ride in automobiles to STOP,
LOOK and LISTEN before passing
over any railway grade orossing.
"Crossing gates, automatic warn
ing bells, electric headlights and en
gine signals, if not heeded by those
for whose protection tliey are in
tended, are unavailing.
"I will be glad to receive ana
consider suggestions intended to re
duce automobile accidents at grade
crossings, for the railroad is anxious
to do its full part. However, if every
persoo who owns, drives or rides in
an automobile will STOP, LOOK and
LISTEN at grade crossings, the dan
ger will be entirely eliminated.

STRONG PROGRAM IS DEING ARRANGED
Prominent Educators Will Address the
Teachers. School Officers and
Patrons Asked to Attend.
The annual Delaware County Teach
ers' Institute will be held in the
High school auditorium in this city on
Thursday and Friday, October 12th
and 13th, 1916.
All teachers of the county must
close their schoils on these two days
and attend the sessions. Certificates
of attendance will be issued to ev
ery teacher who attends the meetings,
and full pay will be given, the same
as though they were at work in their
respective school rooms.
The enrollment will begin at 8:30
A. M. on Thursday, and all teachers
as far as possible should be enrolled
before the first lectttre is given at
10:00 o'clock. Deputy Superintendent
Dutton will during the next few days
mail a detailed program to every
teacher in the county.
Many people seem to have the im
pression that these institutes ar3
conducted solely for the benefit of the
teachers. While many of the sub
jects to be discussed are of vital in
terest to teachers, there is much in
the discussion of these school prob
lems which should interest1the officers
and patrons of our schools. That
these problems might be better un
derstood by patrons and teachers alike
the superintendent asks that as many
school officers and patrons as can
possibly find time should attend the
sessions.
A faculty of well known educator?
