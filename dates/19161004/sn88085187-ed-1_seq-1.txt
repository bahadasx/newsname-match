CASE MOST VITAL,SAYS
CITY ATTORNEY; MAYOR
AFTER LEGISLATURE AID
Opening one of the most far
reaching iiiuiiicipsl tights ever
started In Washington, the Taco
ma Railway & Power Co. has
petitioned the state public service
commission for an order abrogat
ing all ilauses ln its franchises
that find it lo pay tlie city of Ta
coma anything directly or indi
rectly for the privilege of ojiorat
ing.
The company even asks that it
be relieved from the contract of
currying city employes free of
charge.
Tacoma attorneys say that the
case will have a sweeping effect,
because, should the public service
■ i.minis.'.ion rule favorably to the
company, the decision would re
lieve every other street railway Is
the state from paying for the
privilege of operating on city
streets.
The T. 11. & P. Co. alleges that
it is losing money every day that
it operates here, and that it can
no longer continue to run under
existing conditions, without cither
seriously curtailing Its service, or
increasing city fares.

Discontinuance of charge

Humiliation of gross
earnings ta\ to city.
Discontinuance of ,'.O per

of city bridges over which
street curs run.
No further charge for
street improvement work or
maintenance, where cars op
erate.
Force all city employes to
pay cash for transportation
instead of riding on free
tickets.
Any other relief which
the commissioner may <lee«n
proper.
City Attorney Harmon declared
today that the T. 11. & 1\ case is
one of the most important that
has ever been filed against tlie
city.
"The supreme court has held
in other cases that the public
service eonunissslon lias the right
to abrogate parts of franchises or
public service corjioration con
tracts," he declared.
"If that Is the case, it would
seem that the city will be hound
to disprove the T. H. & P. Co.'s
statements of its financial condi
tion, in order to win before the
commission."
It Is believed that city attor
neys from other municipalities
throughout the state will assist
Harmon in defending tlie action.
A negative decision for Tacoma
would wipe out all public service
corporation franchise taxes in
every other Washington city.
Mayor Fawcett declared Wed
nesday that this case was another
argument in favor of home rule
for cities of the first class.
"The T. R. & P. companjj is
earning 2.9 per cent, aecordinAto
its own statement," he said,
course it isn't earning much
money. Hut no business concern
in Tacoma has been prosperous
during the last three years.
"The company wants lo raise
iis earnings to 8 per cent at the
expense of the city. It's an out
rage, and I do not believe that
the commission Votild dare give
them a favorable verdict."
The street railway gross earn
ings tax to Tacoma amounts to
approximately $22,000 annually.
