FIGHTING ON
SOMME FRONT
Capture of Villages Described
Victories Close to Ger
man Fourth Line.
British Take 26,735 Prisoners
and Engage Thirty-eight En
emy Divisions.
London, Oct 4, 10:10 a. m. An of
ficial statement issued here today
gives details of the fighting on the
Somme front after tho advance of
September 15, describing tho capture
of villages, including Combles, Guede
court and Thlepval and reads:
"These victories brought our front
line at more than one place within
one mile of Greman fourth line posi
tions west of Baupaume-Transloy
rond.
"The enemy has fought stubbornly
to check our advance and since Sep
tember 15 seven new divisions have
been brought against us and five
against the French. The severe and
prolonged struggle demanded on the
part of our troops very great deter
mination and courage.
"At the end of September the situa
tion may be summarized as follows:
"Since tho opening of the battle on
July 1 we have taken 26,735 prisoners
and engaged 38 German divisions of
which 29 (about 350,000 men) havo
been withdrawn, exhausted or broken.
Wo hold tho half moon uplands south
of the Ancre, every height of Impor
tance and so have direct observation
ground to tho east and northeast.
The enemy has fallen back upon a
fourth line behind a low ridge just
west of the Bapaume-Transloy road.
"The importance of tho three
months' offensive is not to be judged
by the distance advanced or the num
ber of enemy trench lines taken. It
must be looked for in the effect upon
tho enemy's strength In numbers, ma
terials and morale. Tho enemy has
used up his reserves in repeated, cost
ly and unsuccessful counter attacks
without causing our allies, or our
selves to relax our steady, methodical
pressure."
"In this action troops from every
part of the empire and British islands
havo been engaged. All behaved with
the discipline and resolution of veter
ans. Our aircraft have shown In the
highest degree the spirit of the offen
sive. Thoy have patrolled regularly
far behind the enemy's lines and have
fought many battles in tho air with
hostile machine guns and many with
enemy troops on tho grounds. For
every enemy machine that succeeds in
crossing our front It is safe to say
two hundred British machines cross
tho enemy's front."

Berlin, Oct 4, via London. 5:10 a.
m. The campaign against Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg is dally as
suming a more tangible form. A cir
cular demanding retirement of the
chancellor has been sent by a vocifer
ous group of his opponents to such
members of the relchstag as are con
sldered open to their arguments.
Attacks are made on the chancel
lor's attempts to reach an agreoment
with England, his attitude toward Bel
gian neutrality and his policy in tho
submarine issue. The only name of
international prominence among the
proclamation signers is Ernest Hack
lar and tho circular Is described as
symphonetic rather than serious.
Another factor which is disturbing
the political situation is a breach of
the political truce proclaimed at the
outset of the war which has been lH
made by the Saxon Socialists.
Meanwhile the chancellor and the IH
relchstag leaders continue to discuss IH
the points at issue behind closed .
doors on an even moro confidential
