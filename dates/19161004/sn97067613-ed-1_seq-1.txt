District Nurse Speaks to Club
There was a large attendance at the
Woman's Club Monday evening to hear
Miss Cora Curtis of Burlington speak on
the subject of "District Nursing." Miss
Curtis is a ready, speaker and is full of
enthusiasm over her chosen work. She
gave a most interesting ana compre
hensive sketch of the duties of a District
Nurse, tracing the 01 igin and growth of
the different Associations throughout
the United States and charmed her hear
ers by the little stories of "Real Life"
which she told to bring home her facts.
The life of a District Nurse as described
by Miss Curtis is certainly a most busy
one, but one which is filled with ample
reward springing from the grateful hearts
of those whom she succors.
After the meeting had adjourned sev
eral of the members lingered to talk with
Miss Curtis about the ways and means
of procuring a District, Nurse for it can
not be denied that she is a long felt want
in Morrisville, especially during the
winter months when "LaGrippe" reigns
supreme.
