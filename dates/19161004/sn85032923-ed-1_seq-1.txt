DETROIT, Oct. 2. A mass of
charges and denials was elicited "at
the investigation today into the death
of ten and the injury of 50 persons
last night when a freight train struck
a street car at a crosstown grade
crossing. The street railway com
pany and Grand Trunk road both dis
claimed responsibility. Authorities
detained the engineer and conductor
of the freight, the street car crew and
the crossing gatcmaii.
The switch engine, with three
freight cars, was southbound and the
trolley was gciis' west on Forest
avenue toward the" center of the city.
The end of the first car caught the
trolley almost in the center and swung
it off the tracks until it stood almost
parallel with the moving freight cars.
In the panic that followed the im
pact, passengers leaped from the
doorways and windows. Most of
those who met death were killed by
jumping from the windows and falling
under the wheels of the freight cars.

TOM CAMPBELL.
Sp-ciol to tli .Tmirnal-Sllner.
XOG LES, Oct. 2. Before largest
and most enthusiastic audience ever
assembled in Xogalcs, Tom Camp
bell, tonight delivered a strong, virile
appeal to the people of Santa Cruz
county to bring back to the State the
heart, soul and confidence which it
has lost. He made i deep impression,
convincing all of his genuine sincer
ity. Like all of the speeches of Mr.
Campbell, there came from the atten
tive crowd frequent outbursts of
spontaneous approval and it was ap
parent when he finished that he had
won a lasting place in the regard and
esteem of the people of Kogalcs.
Mr. Campbell spoke of his program
for building up the State and placing
it in the front rank of States where
investment is secure and people of all
classes at peace and happy. He ar
raigned the present governor for
yielding absolutely to a class, and re
iterated his pledge to be fair with
both labor and capital and firm with
both.
The rally was held in the public
rilaza. and the street fronting the
plaza was packed with automobiles
crowded with eager listeners. The
audience filled the rows of scats for
the full distance of the park and men
and women thronged both sides and
the rear. The entire block surround
ing the park was taxed to care for all
who crowded the available space
within hearing.
George H. Smallcy, candidate for
State tax commissioner, was the first
speaker. He told of the inefficiency
he bad found during his investiga
tions of State and county affairs while
employed by the associations of tax
payers and commended the budget
statute as a remedy for the cost of
loca government.
D. Merrill told of the fight in the
legislature of which he was a member
to create the county of Santa Cruz
and of the assistance he rendered. lie
also spoke of the duties of State audi
tor. Mr. Merrill eloquently portrayed
the qualities of the State candidates
traveling with Governor Kibbcy.
Prof. II. E. Matthews, was in his
usual fine voice and spirits, and his
platform for the advancement of the
schools met with hearty response. He
was given an ovation at the close of
his speech.
J. Harry Cloonan spoke of his long
experience in work fitting him to
serve the State as corporation com
missioner, and made an excellent im
pression. By Associated Press.

Senator Burton Discusses
Campaign Issues
Large
(From Tuesday's Daily.)
Ex-Senator Theodore Burton, of
Ohio, last night lived up to iiis na
tional reputation as a speaker in an
address delivered to a big crowd of
Republicans, non-partisans and Dem
ocrats in the Elks' theatre. The Re
publicans went to hear Senator Bur-
ton outline the issues of the day and
the stand which the Republican party :
would take on them and they left
satisfied that the "Grand Old Party." .
rc-unitcd, would "come back strong"
in Xovcmbcr The non-partisans left
with the belief that perhaps they had
better becomr Republicans and thc.ing out of the mighty conflict which,
"hide-bound" Democrats walked down
Gurley street in the rain after the
address with a puzzled look and noth
ing to say, for Senator Burton had
brought up many things that the
Democrats could not explain and had
explained many things that the Dem
ocrats had thought had already been
explained.
Senator Burton is getting along in
years he readily admits :t but lie
proved a forceful speaker and one who
looked every issue square in the face
as an American and not a politician.
E. J. Mitchell, Republican candidate
for county attorney, prcsidcil at the
meeting and first introduced Henry J.
Eads, Republican candidate for con
gress, in introducing senator mir-
ton, Chairman Mitchell urged the au
dience to remember that the issues
confronting the nation should be
looked at more from a patriotic stand
point than from the standpoint of po
litical parties.
Senator Burton had his audience
with him from the start and his re
marks were frequently interrupted by
outbursts of applause. The speaker
made himself at home as soon as he
arose. For several minutes he discuss
ed the future of the Southwest, and
Arizona in particular, telling of the
great reclamation work that was ccr-'
tain to come throughout the State.

said, "and they will be developed to

After a brief introduction. Senator
Burton launched suddenly into his
discussion of the issues of the N'o
vembcr election. He said in part:
"What arc the issues inthc ap
proaching contest?) What arc the
vital questions which arc before the
people today? They are two-fold in
character partly made up of prob-

campaigns, and partly of more scri- j

Let us consider these two phases
of the campaign before us. On the
old familiar issues the Republican j
party stands where it has always j
stood. First of all, it stands for a
reasonable protective tariff, one which
while fostering no monopoly, shall
give to industry stimulus and sup
port, and afford to labor not only its
fair share of the country's prosperity
but an assured position surpassing, in
its opportunities, that of the toilers of
all other lands. Upon this issue there
never was, and never will be, any di

while we enjoy the blessings of peace,
despite the world-wide cataclysm, it
is more important than ever before

may keep the commanding place we

overlooked. During the life of this
administration, with general approval
at Washington, it must be said .arbi
tration treaties were entered into with
France and England. That with
France was finally ratified by the Sen
ate on September 15, 1914, and that
with England some time later. In
each of these treaties it is provided
that in case a dispute arises to which
former arbitration treaties or agree
ments do not apply, or which cannot
be settled by diplomatic methods, the
controversy, whether of law or fact,
sIia11 be submitted to a commission of
fivc members, and the 'high contract-
l'nK Parties agree not to resort, with
respect to each other ,to any act of
force during the investigation to be
made by the commission, and before
ji,s rcl,or' s banded in."
"It should be said that neither of
the contracting parties is to be finally
bound in its action by the report of
the commission.
"It was argued in support of the
treaties that time would be afforded
for cooling off ,and that the public
opinion of the world would be brought
to bear upon the controversy an
opinion which any nation would find
difficult to disregard. It was the uni
versal estimate that the time elapsing
between the submission of the contro-
mission would be not less than a
year. This administration has not
seen fit in any case up to this date
even to submit a question to the
method of settlement provided by
these treaties, and with at least a
year elapsing before a report can be
made, war with France or England is
practically out of the question.
"As regards Germany and Austria,
both of these countries arc surround
ed by a wall of steel created by their
enemies. Their warships cannot go
