He was then confronted with i
this proposal: ;
That the compensation the •
men shall receive under an eight
hour day will be arbitrated, or,
That the President guarantee
he will approve an increase in
freight rates to offset the in
creased cost of operation.
The President is declared to
have repeated his original prom
ise to use his personal and polit
ical influence, but stopped at
that. When the committee left
the White House both sides were
deadlocked.
The delay angered the broth
erhood leaders. They started to
pack up and go home. The move
was constructed as a silent
threat to call a strike at once.
This information reached the
White House and President sent
a messenger hurriedly to the
camp of the leaders with the re
quest that they remain at least
another day.
