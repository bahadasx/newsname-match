Sportsmen of Minnesota and other
northern states have won a notable
victory in their fight against an open
spring season for migratory water

plated an open spring season for the
water fowl. But sportsmen of the
northern states, and, particularly
Minnesota, came out with such a
vigorous protest that the department
decided to adopt regulations prohib
iting spring shooting everywhere in
the United States. ,vt:

hood men today stated that a lew
men might work, but generally the
roads would be tied up tighter than
a drum. With dramatic and sinister sud
denness the crisis arrived in railway
strike negotiations. A break seems
certain this afternoon. There was'*
still hope, but the last thread waa^
considered cut when the employew^^-f*^
showed no disposition to accept the
counter proposals of the railways. -J^
The proposals were as follows:
Railways'Proposals.
"The plan of an eight-hour day
is not directly connected with tlu^L
matter at issue, and there is a dlf-^
ference between an actual eight-hour
day and the eight-hour day as a basi|g|j
for pay rap.

wages are indisputably questioaa-^
which should be settled by arbitra-*J|
ticn
"That the present demand of the^*
trainmen be submitted to arbitration *J
by the interstate commerce commit-^|
sion or some board to be created by^g
the president or in some other way
"That if the arbitrating board 1^
finds wage increases should be
granted, their findings will be re
troactive and the increase will tako
effect from the time the arbitration
begins ~:l~ ."tv^.-r' Ig,
"That a fund should be created By
the railroads to provide for thia con
tingency, the interstate commerce
commission to keep the accounts that
will be necessary, and the arrange
ment to continue in force for a time
not yet determined upon, the men
agreeing that during the period *t
arbitration there shall be no further
demand or any further attempt ^to
strike."
Up to Men. *z
"The railways put the issue sQuare^
ly up to the men," wae the way one
official phrased it today.
Some of the executives said that
while the proposal would not give the
men more than 20 per cent in wages
provided for, in effect in President
Wilson's plan, it probably would give
an increase of over 10 per cent. The
proposal in its tentative form cov
ered over three typewritten pages.
After the vote several of the execu
tives made suggestions which the
committee of eight probably will in
clude in the final draft. ~J*&
