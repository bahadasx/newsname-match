Berlin, Aug. 25. London has been

to-day. This is regarded as demonstrat

The first announcement says merely:

ten hours, carrying a passenger, was

His actual flying time was 8 hours and
40 minutes 520 minutes.
Officials of the F.tation expect
Carlstrom's feat to win the Curtiss '
Aviation Cup, which was awarded last
year for a flight of less than 500
miles. They said the other prizes or

would amount to $7,000.
The machine's engines were stopped

WAY FOR JOINT

Closes on Guillemont,
Links Line with
Foch's.
BRILLIANT DASH
WON MAUREPAS
Rapid Advance of Poilus
Surprised Prince Eitel's
Troops.
By FRED B. PITNEV.
I Ht Cablf? to Tli- TriNin- 1
Paris. Aug. 25.- The British drove
forward c-astward and northward to?
day, in the first movement closing on
Girchy and Guillemont, and in the
second on Flers. This advance joins
up their line with the French, who
seized the important strategic base of
Maurepas yesterday.
In the brilliant dash which foreed
the French line well beyond the out
skirts of Maurepas, General Fayolle
did his part toward the capture of
Combles. When Haig succeids in a
similar movement at Guillemont they
will drive forward together to the apex
of the triangle formed by Maurepas,
Guillemont anti Combles.
Thfl Britiah gains to-day prepared
the way for this movement. They ad
vanced their line in the eastern and
northern edges of the Delville wood,
northwest of Guillemont, and then re
pelled a heavy counter attack. Further
rorth they moved forward several
yards on ench side of the load running
out of Longueval toward Flers.
Haig Moving on Flera.
Haig's troops now have the advan?
tage of advancing downhill toward
! F'.crs. This village presents strong
defences, though they are hardly of
the character of Guillemont. It is
likc'y that progress will be faster in
this direction and that the French
victory at MaurcpBS soon will be
equalled by Haig.
At the opening of the Somme offen?
sive Maurepas was a magic name, rep
resenting the chief fortifications of the
German line between the French troops
and the promised land. Since then it
has iost some of its glamour. its ulti?
mate fall before the French artillery
preparation having become certain dur?
ing the last fortnight, when it was the
object. of relentless assaults by Foch's
troops and guns.
On August 11 Foch's staff showed it
was ready to make a bid for this
stronghold, and every day and night
.ince then Maurepas has received a
drubbing such as no town has ever be?
fore suffered. Although its spectracu
lar importance faded as the fate of the
village became more and more certain,
its strategic importance as a barner to
Combles remained the same until the

On a lower level runs a road and a

screened by German works north of
the village, and traffic has continued
with comparative impunity.
The Krench reached Maurepas bytne

Tragedy.
John Fulton died yesterday trying to
save the lives jf four little boys.
Fulton j;ave his life willingly. He
xvas an inspector of the Union Railway
Company, of The Bronx. He knew
clectricity and hc must have known,
when he began to climb thc burning
freight car upon which stood tour small
bodflfs, rigid in the grip of an 11,000
volt current, that hc xvas going to his
death. Yet he climbed. Two of the
boys are dead, also, but the other two
will recover.
Fulton was in West Farms Square
when he heard srreaming and the snap
and cracklc of a heavy current of elec
trieity from the New York, New Haven
| Hartford freight ya.ds, a hundred
yard? away. With a er?.wd of nvin and
women, he ran to the Tremont Avenue
bridge, which spans thc yard.

one of a long string, wis bursting into

I could see four small boys huddled to

years old, who held the wire, and Carl

'Women on the bridge screamed. Men
shouted and di 1 nothing. Fulton
vaultcd the paranct and dropped twelve
feet to the roof of a boxcar below.
Hc slid off this and ran down the
length of the string to the burning car.
Then he climbed toward where the
current buzzed and shot green sparks
above.
Body Hauled from Car.
The crowd on the bridge saw him die.
They say he never hesitated, but when
he r.-ached the roof ol the burning car
crouched an.' sbrang. He knew a flying
tackle was his only hope of breaking
the mute, contorted little group on the
car top from the grip of the current.
He struck either Raynor or Russo.
Those on the bridge saw a flash of
ftame and saw Fulton's body throxvn
1 off by the force of the electricity and
hurled to the tracks below.
Meantime a call had been sent in for
an emergency crew, ambulances and
fire engines. Men with rubber gloves
climbed throu.rh the flames and man
aged to tear the bajys free. The lire
was quickiy extinguished.
George Raynor, who lived at 20. a
Third Avenue, was dead v.hen they
, brought him down. Donald Russo, of
Itf] Bryant Street, died after being
taken to the Fordham Hospital, with
Krnest and Carl Lehmann, of 1025 East

1 burned, but will recover. They were
later removed to their homes.

the current more readily.

it to his home, at IM East 15oth Street.

"The situation, as far as

has been presented to us. I

Dying Father.
"Giggles" Guglielmo, a convict, pre?
sented himself to Spencer Miller, dep
uty warden of Sinjj Sing, Thursday.
In his hand he held a little ycllow
envelope.
"My father is dying. Mr. Miller,"
he said, gravely. "I just got a tele?
gram. Would it be possible for a
guard to take me beck to New York
to ace him before he goes? I think a
lot of my father".'"
Less than an hour after the deputy
warden had denied his request Gugli?
elmo came baek to the office. He is
a trusted member of the Mutual Wel?
fare League and had been a<signed
to work outside the prison walls.
"I want to be loeked up in my cell
right away," he said, quietly. "Maybe,
if you leave me out, I'li run away to
see my father. Please put me where
I can't get away."
Yesterday Guglielmo was still
loeked in his cell when word came that
the father he "thought a lot of" was
dead.

[From a Staff Correspondent of The Tribune]
Washington, Aug. 25.?The country to-night is again
threatened with an immediate nation-wide railroad strike.
President Wilson's efforts to bring the railroads to his terms
of settlement appear to have failed utterly. He will have be?
fore him within the next twelve hgurs the long-delayed reply
of the roads to the proposal that the railway unions have ac?
cepted.
The roads do not accept the Wilson plan. They propose
a new one which not even the most optimistic of the President's
friends believe the unions will ratify.
The four train service brotherhoods have notified Presi?
dent Wilson that unless the railroads act by to-morrow night
the delegates will leave for home with strike orders in their
pockets.

men, it has attained new complexities.
It has become a politieal problem,
which campaign managers are already
! considering as material for an "issue."
Through the President's suggestion to
the railway executives, it has become a
rate problem, and as such it has set to
work not only forces representing great
financial interests, but manufacturers
and shippers, who would have to pay

And it is these outside forces, repre

National Manufactureri' Association,
thrown powerfull^* on the side of a
peac-.-ful adju.Atmcnt through arbitra?

'Ihrough the support which businesa

been stiffened during the la.t few days
They feel that if a break comes t _
justice of their position will win public
support. I'sed to public misundcr

the alignment of the Presidont on the
' side of the unions, as the railway ex
[ ecutives consider it, does not shake
their confidence that in the event of a
strike they arill win. For the tirst
time, as one of their executives deelared
to-day. "the railroads feel they have a

> New Plan of Managers.
The railroad executives and mana- j
gers, having: received an ultimatum
in turn from tho White House, have
prepared a counter proposal, which
grants less to the unions than they
would receive under the settlement
plan espoused by the President.
This plan provides three things:
1. Concession of the eight-hour
day as far as it is practicable.
2. Arbitration of the question cf
how much money shall be paid for
the eight-hour day in relation ro
the present ten-hour schedule of
rates.
3 The proposed arbitratijn
board to be appointed immediately
by President Wilson instead of, ns
originally planned, arbitration by
the Interstate Commeree Commis?
sion or a commission authorized
by Congress.
Would Bring Arbitration.
The railroads, under this plan,
would obtain their principal demand
?arbitration of the wage question.
The employes would get substantial
ly what they demanded in the way
of an eight-hour basic day. Wheth-tr
they would secure the other point,
ten hours* pay for eight hours' work
In all cases and pro rata overtime
or time and a half pay for overtimi
beyond eij*ht houra in all cases,
would be decided by the arbitrators.
Scarcely any one believes that the
four brotherhooda, chating for daya
under thc delay of the railroad execu?
tives, will agree to these terms. The
men are too confident of winnig all
that they ask by a strike, it would
seem, to accept less than what the
President offered them ai.l publicljr
proclaimed as fair. They nave main
tained all along that the eight-hour
day was not arbitrabie; th..t they al?
ready had it on many roads. It is
expected that they will say the roada'
plan concede*. the eight-hour basic day
enly in principle and "wherever practi?
cable," but not as an absolute rule.
Executives Will Hold Out.
On the other hand the railroada' ex?
ecutives insist that these terms are
all that they can yield Their conten?
tion is that the eight-hour working daj
urged by President Wilson is not applt
cable to train service as it ii to other
industries. They have fought the Prei
iccn'.'s plan on the argument that what
he proposed meant simply a $50,000,000
wuge inerease to one-sevtnth of their
employes. Now they have deviaed thia
sceme to work out a schedule that thejr
hope will not cost them that much
money.
The money queation is the vital isaue.
Thc roada aay that under the plan de
vised by the President, a man now
working a regult-.r ten-hour run would
begin to collect overtime at the end
of the eighth nour insteau of at the end
of the tenth. and that the rate of pay
for the eight houra and for tht over?
time would be increased 25 per cent.
Some of the runs are lesa than eight
houra. Therefore their plan propoaea
an arbitration of the differencei be?
tween the two ao that .. more equitabla
applieation of the eight-hour baaic daj*
and overtime ehargea may be arranged.
The reception that auch a plan will
probably receive from **}? unions waa
