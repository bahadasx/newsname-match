Plans for a $26,000 armory for
Douglas are underway, half of
the money to be raised by the
citizens of that city and the rest
to be contributed by the state
armory fund. This would give
Douglas the finest armory in the
state. The building would be
used for conventions and public
meetings.

Survey of a site for a gravity
water system reservoir in the
Pinal mountains has been order
ed by the Globe city council,
vvhich appropriated $4,000 to de
termine the available water sup
ply from this source. It is ex
pected that the new water sys
tem will cost approximately $10,
000. Plans for a new sewer sys
tem, which will cost approxi
mately $210,000 are under way.
John H. Hall, of Safford, and
Mrs. J. M. Gilliland, of Prank
lin, brother and sister, met this
week at the latter's home, after
being separated for thirty seven
years. The last time they were
together was in 1879, back at
the the old home in Kentucky.
Mr. Hall left in that year and
since then has resided in Kansas
and Oklahoma, coming to Saf
ford a few months ago. Dun

Permission to build a reservoir,
conduit and power house in Sa
bino canyon in the Catalina
mountains has been granted to
John W. Daily, of Tucson by the
secretary of agriculture. The
proposed dam and power plant,
when completed, will be one of
the largest power projects in
Arizona, and is expected to sup
ply power to the city of Tucson,
and to mining camps in the sur
rounding district.
O. H. Morton, a well known
Oregon cattleman, while attempt
ing to secure some desert plants
from a cliff on the road from
Phoenix to Globe, fell down a
precipice, catching a small tree,
and holding on. A four year
old girl, from an auto saw him
and called her father's attention,
and Mr. Morton was soon re
scued with the aid of a rope.
The little girl was presented
with a check for $100.
The Northern Arizona Normal
school starts out with 265 stud
ents ragistered for the fall term
which began last Monday. This
is the record, the highest pre
vious to this being last year with
263. It is thought the list will
reach l00. The school is badly
cramped for quarters and the
next legislature will be asked
for a liberal appropriation. The
school runs twelve months each
year. The Messenger.
Although paper mills are man
ufacturing more paper than ever
before, the price of print paper
continues to rise and the pub
lishers of the country are facing
an exorbitant advance in its
price. Already it has gone up
and the publishers of New York
have entered into an agreement
to curtail their use of paper.
Prices of subscription are being
raised all over the country as a
result of the recent advances.
There are, many so-called so
cialistic principles, to which
every true American can and
does heartily subscribe and we
freely recognize the right of
every American to whatever pol
itical belief he may adopt. But
we confess that we have little
respect for an avowed socialist
who for the sole purpose of
gaining office temporarily es
pouses and claims allegiance to
the democratic party as is being
done in Arizona today. It is a
poor tub that can't stand on its
own bottom, and although oft
attempted we have never known
of anyone who was able to suc
cessfully carry water on both
shoulders at the same time.

A. H. Edwards and P. W:
Wilkey have purchased the Pa
tagonia Smoke-house from C. J.
Trask, taking charge this week.
Mr. Edwards is a surveyor and
! has been employed on the coun
I ty roads for some time, assisting
j the county engineer. Mr. Wilkey
is a Nogales business man, and
will move his family from that
city to Patagonia. Both are well
known and popular throughout
the county, and should enjoy a
a good business. Patagonian.
Mrs. Harry Wiltse has a copy
of the Ulster County (N. Y.) Ga
zette dated January, 1800, which
gives an account of the death of
George Washington, December
14th, 1799. The paper has been
handed down in her family for
generation to generation, and is
in a remarkable good state of
preservation, with the print as
clear as the day it was printed.
The spelling was the quaint old
fashioned kind, using the "f"
for "s." It is a very interesting
document because of the kind of
news, peculiar advertisements
and general make up. Coconino

After years of wandering
around the earth, Mike Rice,
one of the best known news
paper men in the state, arrived
in Kingman yesterday. Mike
was injured in an automobile
wreck about a year ago and was
discharged from the hospital
about a week ago. He is again
in the land of his first love
Arizona and intends to remain
forever and forever. He "ex
pects to leave Kingman today
for Prescott and the southern
country. Rice is known in every
mining camp of the west, from
Mexico to Alaska, and in every
one cf the camps he meets with
hearty welcome. Miner.
Henry Serrano, formerly of
near Patagonia, but who has been
living in Bisbee for sometime,
was stabbed early Sunday morn
ing and died from the effects of
the wound. He was with four
Mexicans on the streets of Bis
bee, when a quarrel started and
one of his companions drew a
long knife and started to cut in
every direction. He struck Se
rrano in the left side of the ab
domen, the knife passing entire
ly through the stomach and
coming out at the back, just over
the kidney. The murdered man
was a son of Dona Gerarda Se
rrano, and was raised in Serrano
canyon, a few miles from Pata
gonia. He leaves a wife and
several children. Patagonian.
Patagonia will have within a
short time an up-to date tele
phone system. Application was
made to the supervisors last
week for a franchise by W. A.
Gatlin and Pat Patterson, two
young business men of this town,
to build, equip and maintain a
telephone system from .Nogales
to Patagonia, thence to Sonoita
and Elgin, . and on towards Pair
banks, where it will connect
with the toll lines of Cochise
county and other parts of the
state. Also from Patagonia to
Harshaw, up Harshaw Canyon
via Mowry and on to the San Ra
fael valley. The promoters are
amply equipped financially, and
as Mr. Patterson has had much
experience in the telephone busi
ness, there is every reason to
believe the venture will be a
great success. Patagonian.
Any government that would
hold a child-labor law unconsti
tutional if the law is correctly
drawn with intent to protect the
health, life, cibmfort and safety
of the child as well as of the
human race to follow, would
cease to be a court of justice.
Laws are made for but two pur
poses: To protect the weak and
to restrain the vicious. The
child is weak and it is entitled
to protection. Strain the consti
tution if necessary, amend the
document if absolutely essential,
but protect the children from
the vicious sweat shops. Wealth
gold, luxuries are not to be com
pared with human welfare and
especially those of tender years,
the future men and women of
the nation. Surely preservation
of the health of the child comes
under "to promote the general
welfare" clause if nowhere else.
President Wilson was right to
demand the law and no court
will hasten to undo the act.
FORTUNE IN OLD AGE.
Took a Chance in United Verde Ex
tention at the Right Time.
A romance of the mining
"game" in which two Butte men,
one rated as the sixth richest
man in the United States and the
other a man of moderate wealth,
figured, i found in the sudden
acquisition of approximately
$2,000,000 by Capt. James Hoat
son, who was in charge of the
Butte & Boston company mines
prior to their passing into the
Anaconda company group. Capt.
Hoatson, who is advanced in
years, is now living in San Fran
cisco with his wife, possessed of
a fortune lie did not dream of
when he "took a chance" on a
stock which he had been advised
to buy by a friend who had in
vestigated the mine.
About two years ago United
Verde Extension, a mine adjoin
ing the United Verde mine of
Senator Clark's, was just being
talked of. Men said it was using
the name of the famous neighbor
in stock promotion, and there
was not much interest in the
property. At that time the stock
was selling around 25c a share.
A friend of Captain Hoatson
went quietly to the property and
was convinced of the richness
and extent of the ore bodies.
He advised the captain to buy,
and being a practical mining
man, the captain made his own
investigation. He put his sav
ings into the stock around 25
cents a share. When the war
came on and the copper industry
began to pick up, the stock had
some advance, but about six
months ago it had only advanc
ed to a point under $3.
Yesterday the stock was quot
ed at $27.50 a share, and Capt.
Hoatson, who had profited more
than a hundred fold on his in
vestment, -cn count his profits
at about $2,000,000, and he has
hopes that the stock will go
higher. Iu the autumn of his
life Captain Hoatson finds a new
problem that of spending his
riches. Wallace, Idaho, Miner.
SCHOOL HOUSE ON WHEELS.
In Southern Pacific extra gang
under Foreman Taft, who has a
crew of fifty men on Superinten
dent Whalen's Los Angeles Di
vision, there are 25 more child
ren who are being taught daily
in a box car which has been fit
ted up with benches. They have
a teacher who instructs them
daily in English and Spanish
and primary work. The results,
thus far, have not only been sa
tisfactory, but the class of men
in the gang remains high. As
the gang moves along from
place to place so does the school
car and the children never have
to miss a. day's attendance. Su
perintendent Whalen has now
made arrangements to obtain an
old passenger coach which will
be fitted up with benches and
black boards and which will be
easier to heat, expecting in this
way to improve materially the
condition in this unique sphool
room. He has furthermore ar
ranged to fit up a hospital car
for the women and children in
the camp who become ill.
Can Change Party Affiliations.
Voters who have registered as
members of the political party
and who wish to change their
registration to that of members
of another party may do so, pro
vided they call at registration
offices and request the change
before the close of registration
Sept. 1, which is the time for
closing of the books prior to
the primaries. This applies to
voters who have registered as
non-partisans or to those of any
party who wish to change from
one to another. Those who
have registered as non partisans
could not have a vote in the
primaries otherwise, hence the
events leading to this change.
The new interpretation of the
state law comes in form of an
opinion rendered by the attorney
general and is sent out to the
county recorders of the state.
The question was raised in Co
chise county and from there put
up to the attorney general.
ELGIN-SONOITA PICNIC.
The finance committee of the
Settlers' picnic of Elgin and So
noita dropped around yesterday
ana invited the people of Tucson
to the merry making. Since the
invitation comes from the finance
committee, it may be considered
gilt edged.
Dr. T. J. Hies and wife and R.
L. Schock and wife composed the
party.
"How is that ancient feud be
tween the Sonoita and Elgin set
tlers' prospering?" they were
asked.
"The feud has been patched
up and forgotten long ago," re
plied Dr. lies.
The fifth annual picnic will be
held at Fruitland hall, which is
on the railroad and thus easy of
access, on September 9. It is a
reunion, a barbecue and a dance.
Field sports will be organized
on the ground.
Celebrated products of the
dry farming country, such as
pumpkin pie, well water, home
raised hogs and cattle, and
beans, will be on the table.
There is a bumper crop of
pink beans in the valley this
season, and with the price at
nine cents per pound instead of
four as usual, every dry-farmer
feels like a budding millionaire.
Secretary Myers of the cham
ber of commerce has been offi
cially informed that the pad
lock's off the gate for Tucson
folks. It will also b a field day
for candidates for political office.
The settlers of three counties,
Pima, Santa Cruz and Cochise,
will listen to them.
ENGINEERS TO MEET IN ARIZONA
Recognizing the importance of
the State of Arizona to the coun
try's mining interests, the Amer
ican Institute of Mining Engi
neers will meet for the first time
in its history of 45 ye'ars in that
State next month. Sessions of
the meeting will extend over the
entire week of September 18th
and will be held in the principal
mining centers of the State, the
members traveling between the
various points by special train
and automobile. Principles of
mining and metallurgy of the
greatest interest will be pre
sented at the technical sessions.
Some indications of the im
portance of this meeting to min
ing engineers in various sections
of the country is shown by the
fact that a special train has been
arranged for, to carry Eastern
members from New York City
on September 14th. Other mem
bers and their guests will join
the party at various points en
route and at El Paso, Tex. The
western section of the conven
ing members, starting from Los
Angeles, Cal., will meet the
train and continue to Arizona.
GRAND CANYON DESCRIBED.
Few persons can realize on a
first view of the Grand Canyon
that it is more than a mile deep
and from eight to ten miles wide.
The cliffs descending to its
depths form a succession of huge
steps, each 300 to 500 feet high,
with steep rocky slopes between.
The cliffs are the edges of hard
beds of limestone or sandstone;
the intervening slopes mark the
outcrops of softer beds. This
series of beds is more than 3600
feet thick, and the beds lie near
ly horizontal.
Far down in the canyon is a
broad shelf caused by the hard
sandstone at the base of this
series, deeply trenched by a nar
row inner canyon cut a thousand
feet or more into the underlying
"granite." The rocks vary in
color from white and buff to red
and pale green. They present
a marvelous variety of pictures
que forms, mostly on a titanic
scale, fashioned mainly by ero
sion by running water, the agent
which has excavated the canyon.
-U. S. Geological Survey.
J. B. Garland, chief clerk at
the United States forestry office
in the Chiricahua mountains,
has arrived in Tucson and will
be connected with the local office
in the future. The move is part
of the recent consolidation of the
two national forests. Tucson is
headquarters for the consolidat
ed forest reserves.
