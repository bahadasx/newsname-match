Alfred F. Pillsbury, Flour King,
Shows Influence of Great

Stop the European war: down goes
the price of wheat, coincidental flour
also tumbles presto, the high cost of
living is reduced!
In this inflated age of high-flying
figures the foregoing, gleaned from
an - informal talk with, one of the
greatest flour mill men In the world,
is pleasingly pertinent. j
The flour king who talked Is no
other than Alfred F. Pillsbury, presi
dent of the Pillsbury Flour Mills Com
pany of Minneapolis, which boasts the
"finest flour manufactured in the
world, Pillsbury's Best." .
Mr. Pillsbury is visiting in Honolulu
with Mrs. Pillsbury for the first time,
for a real vacation. They are very
comfortable In one of the Moan.a
Hotel cottages near the Seaside Hotel
and will be here about a month.
Although quite hospitable and con
genial, Pillsbury explained to a news
paper man that he had never been
Interviewed. It is against his prin
ciples, he says. But he did not object
to talking quite informally and un
officially of the wheat crop, the Pills
bury mills, the fluctuating price of
flour and other things of interest.
His impression of the Islands' at
tractions the flour magnate wishes to.
reserve until he has seen more of
them.
"I have marked some of them very
high and some low, already," he says.
Mr. Pillsbury explains that his com
