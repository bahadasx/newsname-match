It is expected that a joint resolution
to provide for adjournment Friday

There is nothing mystical nor enigmatical about advertising. It
is simply a straightforward publicity proposition. As one advocate of
it says, "It can influence a million minds at once, at the cost of from a
few cents down to the decimal part of one cent each. The mission
of advertising is to take the burden of educational work off the
shoulders of the salesman and enables him to start in nearer to the
order."
Unfortunately there are not millions in this end of Connecticut
who might be influenced by the advertising carried in the columns of
The Bulletin. There are, however, many thousand who depend upon
it to get in touch with the opportunities for trade, for chances of
supplying their wants to the best advantage and for the assistance
which it renders to those who have the purchasing to do, property to
rent, articles for sale or those who make the seeking help or positions.
It is as invaluable to the business houses as an advertising medium
as it is to the two counties as a news distributor. -It is a positive
factor as a business builder.

Regiment, National Guard of Georgia,

HOLD FOR ARBITRATION
Crisis Expected at Noon Today, When
President Has Engagement to See
the Brotherhood Leaders
White House.
at the
Washington, Aug. 25. After the
heads of the four great brotherhoods
threatening a nation-wide strike had
gone to the White House today with
a warning that their men would not
wait longer than tomorrow night for
a reply from the railroad executives
to President Wilson's suggestion that
an eight hour day be granted, the ex
ecutives tonight agreed upon a counter-proposal
to be submitted to the
president tomorrow. This plan, hold
ing to the demand for arbitration
which the employes have declared
they unalterably oppose, proposed.
What Railroad Officials Propose.
"That the question of an eight hour
day is not directly connected with the
matter at issue and that there is a
difference between an actual eight
hour day and an eight hour day as a
S69 2735 4638
basis for pay.
"That questions of increases of
wages are indisputably questions
which should be settled by arbitra
tion. "That the present demands cf the
trainmen be submitted to arbitration
by the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion or some board, to be created by
the president or in some other way.
"That if the arbitrating board finds
wage increases should be granted
their finding will be retroactive and
the increase will take effect from the
time the arbitration begins.
"That a fund shall be created bv
tho railroads to provide for this con
tingency, the Interstate Commerce
commission to keep the. accounts that
will be necessary and the arrangement
to continue in force for a time not
yet determined upon, the men agree
ing that during the period of arbitra
tion there shall be no further demands
nor any attempt to strike."
Drafted by Eight Presidents.
A draft of this report was submit
ted tonight by the committee of eight
presidents who have been constantly
at work upon its various phases for
a week. There was some discussion,
but only one vote vas taken and by
It the sixty presidents and the mana
gers approved 'the draft. Some slight
additions to the phraseology are to be
made and the final draft presented at
another meeting tomorrow morning.
From that meeting the report is ex
pected to be taken to President Wil
son. It was said tonight this will be
the final report from the executives.
"It puts the issue squarely up to
the men," was the way one official
phrased It.
The crisis in the situation is ex
pueeted b- noon tomorrow, when the
president has an engagement to see
the brotherhood leaders.
Some of the executives said that
while the .proposal would not give the
men more than twenty per cent, in
crease in wages provided for in effect
in President Wilson's plan, it prob
ably would give an increase of over
10 per cent.

REPRESENTATIVES OF BROTH
HOODS HAVE LOST PATIENCE
WILL WAIT NO LONGER
Informed President Wilson That Unfler
No Circumstances Would They Re
main in Washington Longer Than
Tonight.
Washington, Aug. 25. A crtsts to
morrow in the threatened nation-wide
railroad strike appeared unavoidable
tonight.
Heads of the four railroad brother
hoods went to the White House today
and informed President Wilson that
under no circumstances would they
hold their committee of 640 here after
tomorrow night. The men. they said
were demanding that they obtain some
definite answer from the railroad heads
on President -Wilson's plan, already ac
cepted by them, or that they be per
mitted to go home and prepared for a
strike. Everything was lecla.red to be
in readiness for a walkout "whenever
the committee of 640 gave the word.
To Meet Men This Noon.
The president is understood to have
given the men. no definite promise aa
to what he would do. He made an
appointment with them for tomorrow
noon, however, and shortly after they
left the White House sent for three of
the railroad executives to advise them
of what had happened. The railroad
presidents and managers held two
conferences during the day and con
tinued their sessions until late tonight,
working on a communication to the
president setting forth their position
on the proposal that they grant an
eight hour day with pay at the rate
r.uvr given for a ten hour basic day. It
waM understood that the tentative draft
of tiii? conmiunicaii in sets forth that
the r.-iilroads agree to the eight hour,
day piineipie, but believe that the pay
for s.: h a d:y .hould be made the
ttu'bjeet of arbitration.
The railroad heads insist, as they
have front the lie ginning of negotia
tions, that it is increased pay and not
a shorter work day that the employes
realty desire. To grant them the
shorter basic day at the present pay,
it is contended, would mean an addi
tional annual expenditure of $52,000,
000. Representatives of the men indi
cated tonight that such a reply would
be unsatisfactory.
Railroad Heads Would Welcome Strike
It has been well known since the
railroad presidents came here that
many of Them would wclceme a strike.
Some oi thorn have poii ted out that in
their opinion submission in the present
crisis would weaken discipline on their
lines and that it would only be a short
time until the trainmen's demands are
followed b ysimil.ir ones of other em
I'I'.ye. Many of them feel that a
strike could last only a few days at
the longest, and the more important
systems would have little trouble
handling the mails and milk trains and
supplying the larger cities with food
si a ffs.
The railroad executives virtually dis
missed from all consideration today
ouestloiv of freight rate increases and
of methods of insuring settlement of
future disputes. They (entered atten
tion on the two propositions of the
eight hour day and the arbitration of
wages tinder it.
Howard Elliott's Views.
Statements were issued by Presi
dent Howard Elliott of the Xew Haven
and li. IT. Aishton of the Chicago and
Northwestern. Mr. Elliott said he
hoped a real solution would be found
for the .situation "rather than that it
should be settled off-hand and solely
in the interest of the 400,000 who are
now pressing their demands." Presi
dent Aishton said that in 1900 the
amount of wages paid train employes
for each l.OuO tons of f night moved
one mile was 50.4 cents, while it 1914
it was 01 cents, an increase of 23 per
cent.
The conference committee of mana
cris made public several telegrams
from commercial organizations and in
dividuals supporting their insistence
upon arbitration of labor disputes.
Practically an Ultimatum.
It was a determined quartette from
the brotherhoods that visited the pres
ident today to deliver their ultimatum.
On. "Wednesday evidence of unrest
among the committee of 640 became so
apparent that their leaders considered
the situation grave and it required
their best efforts to prevent a vote on
a proposal to withdraw from the nego
tiations immediately.
Some Trains Would Run Anyway.
Cne of the leaders said tonight that
in the event of a strike being called
crews hauling- trains with supplies for,
soldiers on the Mexican border, a lim
ited number of passenger and express
trains and, possibly, some milk trains,
would be permitted to continue work.
