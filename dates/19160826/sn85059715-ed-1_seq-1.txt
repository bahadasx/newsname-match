WASHINGTON. August L'v A crisis
1n the negotiations looking to the
/avoidance of a nationwide railway
strike appeared imminent today when
a counter proposal involving arbitration
was prepared by the railroad
presidents for final .submission to
President Wilson. On the+acceptubil1ty

largely whether the president's personal
efforts to mediate shall fail.
(Heretofore the brotherhood leaders (
have stood firmly against any plan to .
arbitrate their demands for an eight-;

wages.
The railroad executives met early
1oday to perfect the draft of their proposal
and were expected to send it
