great nation-wide strike which
will involve 400,000 brotherhood
men.

Make Counter Proposals.
By United Press
Washington, August 26. The break
between the railroad brotherhoods,
representing 400,000 men, and tho rail
road presidents, seems certain. The
sixty executives who were called here
by President Wilson a week ago have
ignored his peace proposals and have
decided to submit a substitute propo
sition which even the most optimistic
among them feel the brotherhoods will
turn down. This proposition provides
that the eight hour day will not be
tried until after arbitration and Inves
tigation and that the question of wages
and overtime will bo passed on by an
impartial commission.
The railroads will make no request
for beneficial legislation or Increased
rates.

TO TEARS
Mexican Frank Breaks Down for Moment
on Eve of Departure to Serve
Long Sentence
SAYS AMERICANS
DRUGGED HIS WINE
Remembers Bias Lopez to Have Drawn
Gun on Him, He Says, and Then
His Memory Goes Blank
Brought face to face with the stern
reality that he was about to enter up
on a long expiation of his crimo, twenty-five
years at hard labor in a foreign
land, Francisco Hen-era, "Mexican
Frank," broke down yesterday evening
and for a moment lost that stoicism
which characterizes the Mexican who
suffers either deep physical or mental
anguish and broke into tears. It was
during an interview which begave to
a representative of the Chic-kasha Ex
press, talking through the bars of bis
cell.
Not In Jail Break,
Up to the last the self-convicted
man denied any participation in the
recent attempt at jail breaking.
"1 knew nothing of the matter," he
said earnestly, "and I do not know how
that fragment of a small saw happen
ed to be in my cell. I suppose it must
have bi.:. lei't tl.cjd li a iormu occu
pant. All that I know of the whole
occurrence is that I bad been walking
In the corridor and, becoming tired,
had stepped into my cell to lie down',
when I heard what I believed to be two
men at work on the bars. Not beinj
able to speak in English I did not cry
out to the jailer. I have been unable
to make my smallest wants known,
therefore should not have been able to
tell him what was occurring. I do not
know who it was that sawed the bar."
As was published in a former issue,
Francisco Herrera, in view of the dam
aging evidence which was presented
against him at the preliminary hearing
in Judge Moore's court, pleaded guilty
to the charge of manslaughter taking
the sentence above mentioned. It was
wot until last night, however, that tiio
full force of his condition dawned on
hfm end he began to think of homo
and mother.
Memory Returns.
"1 am still in doubt as to whether I
killed my frielid Bias," he declared,
"but if I did is must have been in self
defense. I remember nothing beyond
a certain point after I had drunk only
a moderate quantity of wine which, I
feel ture, must have been drugged
etiher in a joke or for evil intent by
some Americans with whom I was ac
quainted. I had kept my bottle of wine
in a bucket of cold water and I be
lieved they played this joke on me for
if. hid never affected me like that be
fore. What I remember is that we
were playing cards and Bias was out
of humor owing to a personal difficul
ty in v. nich he had engaged with an
clhr. When I refused or rather toid
him I would pay him when I went to
work again he pulled his gun and
wuuHl have killed me had the Run
lieen loaded. I then took up a butch
er knife and placed it in my sleov-3.
What happened beyond this point I
do not remember. After Bias hid
fallen Jose Negrete came upon us i'?d
instead cf inquiring 'what is the mat
ter i.iiigo (friend)' he said harshly,
'what have you done to Bias.' This
angered rr.e and I picked up tho gun
which was net loaded and which c
not have l.ftn dangerous.
F;views Past Life.
'This ia a sad end. I have been a
I. aid worker on a railroad and have
enl my mother and sisters what mon

roads in Mexico. And to think that

MM TRAINS
Competent Ex-Engineers and Ex-ConduclorS
Among Minor Officials Could Oper
ate Passenger Trains
STRIKE WOULD NOT
AFFECT MAILS
Rock Island Official Declares No Advance
Instructions Have Been Received
Here for Strike
"I do not believe that, in the cvcuE
of a general strike being declared, It
would effect passenger traffic on thf
Rock Island," said an official of that
road today to a representative of the
Chickasha Expresa when informed oC
the latest serious phase of the strika
situation. "I have no doubt, what
ever, that all the mails would go out
and I believe we could operate nearly
If not all of the regular passenger
trains and thus maintain our present
schedules.
"Iu the service of the Rock Island
is a sufficient number of minor offi
cials to man the passenger trains, and.
being old railroad engineers and ,co.
ductors, the brotherhood men them
selves, as I understand it, could tali
no exceptions to their acting in thosa
capacities. They would not be consid
ered in the light oi strike-breakers. ,
"However, that is only my privata
opinion. Although I understand that
tho Santa, has mado arrangements in
advance for continuing their servica
In case of trouble, no Mteli Instructions
have1 been received here so tar as ?
have learaed and what la done would
be extemporaneous."
This official estimated that In case
of a lockout 100 trainmen and engi
neers on the Rock Island living iu
Chickasha would be affected. Be
sides this thore are about 320 shopmeri
In the Rock Island employ here wha
are members of various unions whicli
In themselves would not be directly in

"However, what tho Rock Island
would do under those conditions is ca
tlrely problematic at least so far 09
any except the heads of the road hava '
knowledge," continued the official.
"GOD'S MESSAGE .
AND THE RESULT'
Rev. Jno. A. Wray, pastor of thfl
First Baptist church, has announced
that he will speak Sunday night on
"God's Message to a City, faithfully
delivered and its result." Mr. Wray,
says that in his introduction he will
have occasion to refer to "Jonah and
the whale." to much talked about and
will at that time give a detailed de
scription of the big fish caught near
his Florida home four years ago
fish that has attracted world-wide at
tention, and a fish that could hava
taken care of a half dozen Jonahs and
their families. He will also, says Vr.
Wray, emphasize during the course ot
his sermon that there is nothing tha
matter with Christianity never hJ
been but with the promulgation oi
the message.
"The salvation of the city," says lie,
"and the world and the faithful deliv
ery of God's message and its accep
tance, and not the countless nostrums
concocted iu the brain of man its nu
merous pages of 'stuff paraded iu
many of tie current magazines of ths
past twenty-four mouths to the con.
trary notwithstanding."
