"FLAG AND HONOR ARE EVER FIRST"
Salt Lake, Aug. 25. With the
greatest outpouring of people who
ever recclveil a presidential candi
date in this city1, Salt Lake yesterday
paid tribute to Chas. Evan Hughes,
Republican nominee for the Presiden
cy ,of the United States.
) The climax to a stirring day catno
last night when 12,000 persons filled
every available inch of sitting and
standing room in tho Tabernacle,
massed themsolves iri the aisles and
packed thomselves into the doorway
of tho great structure to glimpse at
tho distinguished visitor and to bear
Ms address. And hundreds unablo
tu gain entrance to the building
i wero forced to stand on the outside
, in tho hope of gaining' a view of him
later.
Tho coming of Mr. Hughes to Utah
was marked by a wondeiful display
of enthusiasm. From the time that
Mr. Hughes stopped from the train
and with Mrs. Hughes on his arm
made his way through a thousand
cheering admirers at the Oregon
Short Line union station until ho
- was ungulfed in tho vortex of the
maelstrom of welcome accorded him
I at tho gigantic meeting last nlfjht, he
was classified as a man of the pcoplo
A by all of those who came in contact
W' with him.
I Shows His Democracy
1 Tho first step of democracy by Mr.
I Hughes was taken when he dismissed
1 a closed automobllo which had been
I sent for him to tho railroad station
H With a wave of his hand he sent tho
I machine away and climbed Into an
open car that, to use his words, "I
J may see tho pcoplo."
It was a cosmopolitan audlenco that
beard him at the Tabernacle. Every
walk of life was represented. And
tho women of Utah paid their candi
date a tribute such as no other pres
idential nominee has - over received
here. Thoy attended the meeting by
the thousand. Also there was notice
ablo a liberal sprinkling of tho uni
formed mon who aro studying tho
war gamo, i't Fort Douglas.
Personality Grips Audience
, Tho magnetic Pewnallty of tho
nominee, his strongforceful; at times
eloquent and over emphatic manner
of annlyzlng his topic of dlsousslon in
n simple, concise manner, nud his
way of driving home his polnte In
logical sequenco and Impressive de
livery, yot'ir. language thot nppeaiou
oven to tho humblest cltlzon present,
gripped tho Tabornacle audience, who
in turn stamped tholr Indelible ap
, provnl on his Individuality and wnnn
., sympathetic person.
Whllo his appearance before tho
While was tho signal for am outburst
orapplauso, tho pent up feelings of
tho audience burst forth when, as ho
waB pleading for undiluted American;
turn, ho said:
"Wo proposo to hold before tho
world tho (lag of tho United States
as tho flag which has wovor botrayod
a truBt."
Mr. HugheB' speech was a straight
forward presentation of tho problems
that confront tho country nud tho
remedies as ho, as tho cnndldato of
the nopuhllcan party sees them, In
J , torsporsod with criticisms of the pol
kr r Idos of tho Democratic administra
tion ns appllod to tho Internal proh
lems of tho country and Its deficien
cies in mooting tho questions tinolv
od In its relations with other .nations
Tho tariff, commercial and military
preparedness and tho solution of cc
onomlo nrobloms that ho said will ho
tho war's aftermath, woro tho chh'f
matters discussed by him.
War Will Not 8avo Dourbons
"Tho Democratic party will not ho
navcil by tho Etiropoan war," tnld
Mr. Hughes and tho meeting cheered
again. He then dissected the position
of tho Democratic party In regard to
the tariff, and declared that the pco
plo of the United States had no right
to expect from the Democrats ade
quate protection for American Indus
try. Ho recited tho history of tho
party on tho tariff. Ho wonf" Into the
propnultlon of tho Increases of exports
from this country to Europe and de
clared that the country's prosperity
now Is dependent on tho demands
created In Europe for American made
goods on account of tho war. Ho urg
ed tho voters to look forward to the
end of tho European military holo
caust and' asserted that the American
people could not bo fooled Into be
lieving that tho prosperity which has
ci. ru o about as a result of the war
will contlnuo when the soldiers or
tho fighting nations lay down their
arms and return to work In the mills
factories, mines and fields of Europe.
"To say such a thing, that prosper
ity will bojbcrc after the war and
that exports will be the same as now"
said Mr. Hughes, "would tax the
credulity of even the n ost export com
piler of Democratic figures.
Hoasscrtcd-that the Republican
Tarty would stand by the Philippines.
He declared that to give up the Isl
ands now would be a betrayal of the
promises which had been made to
tho peoplo of tho Islands and that the
American flag should never be hauled
down until schools teaching right and
knowledge and free Institutions had
been established there.
Ho asserted that no nation could
progress If It had at the head of one
of tho Important departments of the
government a mnn who was unablo
to fill the requirements of the department.
Talks On Preparedness
Mr. Hughes then took up the ques
tion of preparedness. He asserted
that the administration had made sev
eral proposals whereby the country
could bo prepared and ho declared
that such an emergency existed that
tho then secretary of War L. M Gar
rison preparetfBTp"r&gra$ and' that 'It
met with thq approval of tho admin
istration until such time as it was
thought by ,tho administration that
another program should be Inaugurat
ed. Mr. Hughes assorted that when
the secretary of war's program went
the secretary vent with It
' "Wo want to be propnred for"dc
fense and we want to bo so prepared
that we will bo understood to bo
ipady for an emergency so that our
words wltl be taken at full value," do
clared Mr. Hughes.
When tho cheering and npplauso
had subsided ho turned to tho Mexi
can situation ns regards tho sending
of tho national guard to the Moxlcan
border. Ho declared that tho men of
tho factories of tho ofllcen and the
professions should not have been tak
en uway to tho hordor. H pralaed
tho patriotism of tho members of tho
nnllonal guard and asserted that as
far as ho could soo they thought thoy
were taking tho federal army oath In
order that they might go to the front,
"My Idea of this matter Is that the
United States Bhould havo large
enough nrmy to prevent raids of ban
dits, bordor Incursions and petty fight
ing 'without calling upon the national
guard," said Mr. Hughes.
Declares For Suffrage
Ho closed his address with a de
claration favoring woman's suffrage.
Mr. Hughes ?ald tho women of tho
United States could not avald tho re
sponsibility of government becauso
thoy did not nil havo the ballot, and
asserted that ho hoped tho tlmo would
come when till should otu and shurn
In tho responsibilities. His declara
tion brought forth rousing cheers.
