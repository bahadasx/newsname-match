"OKLASODA."
The name of a new Newspa

The Name Represents Ok.,

Sate Benito, Texas.—The "Obla
soda," a weekly newspaper, pub
iisbed by the members of the Ok
laboma, Louisiana and Ronlb Ha
kota National Guardsmen, form
ing the provisional brigade sta
tioned in this section, ta to make
the first appearance today.
The "Oklasoda" receives its
name from a combination of sylla
blea in the militia organization!
whose activities while on border
doty it will chronicle. This is
the second army newspaper on the
Texas frontier, the ''Illinois Caval
ryman" being the first.
The "Oklasoda" will have four
pages on its initial number, and
will be edited by the members of
the newspaper and printing pro
fessions in the three national
guards.
REST AN HOUR AT
NOON.
Not enough stress is being laid
on the importance of the midday
rest hour," said a prominent tu
bereu losis specialist of this state
recently. "The noon rest boor is
as essential for maintaining health
and efficiency as the noon meal,
sometimes more so, and should
not include the time takeu for the
meal."
Every wotking woman, eape
oialiy those who woik in offices,
stores and mills, housekeepers by
uo means excepted, should have
an hour at noon to real—to lie
down, relax aod rest brain, nerves
and body. I dare say," said the
speaker, "the lack of this period
of daily rest is more the cause of
so many women coming down with
tuberculosis than any other one
thing. If the midday rest hour is
snob an important factor in the
cure of tuberculosis, why is it not
as important in the prevention of
the disease!
"The rest boor," continued he,
"is not essential in preventing
and coring tuberculosis only; it is
the greatest factor in keeping np
that resistance that stays off
moat all other diseases. It is the
means of keeping fit and efficient,
of avoiding that fatigue of mind
and body that oaoaea accidents,
miscalculations, errors and ineffi
miscalculations, errors and ineffi
cient work altogether. It is the
means of avoiding mental and
physical breakdowns aud, at the
same time, of accomplishing

PROTECTION IS THE
PREPAREDNESS THIS
COUNTRY WILL
MOST NEED SOON.
The Herald has been criticised
severely for suggesting to Mr.
Hughes, the republican nominee
for the Presidency, Hiat Lie» iudi
cate to the public the type of mao
he would place in each important
Cabinet place. It was said by
tire republican press that the sag
gestion was made for the purpose
of embarrassing Mr Hughes
But the democratic press saw the
point according to its own lights
and declared that it was proof
that the Herald was a ''Hughes
paper "
It was merely a tentative hint
to Mr. Hughes, more to test him
than to lease him The Herald
now says that Mr. Hughes would
he doing bis cause more good if he
stopped finding fault with rela
tively unimportant spoils grab
bmg by the Wilson administra,
lion aud announced that the ques
tion of protection lo American in
dustries was a matter touching
the very futuie life of tlie country.
It would like to have him say that
be would place in his Cabinet to
stand behind his economic policies
the most important and most sue
cessful business men to be found
between the two oceans.
It is true that Mr. Hughes has
proclaimed his fidelity to protec
tion, but he has touched ou that
just as be bas touched on many
keys. He has nor touched high (J
on the tariff Those who prate of
tariff commissions and treat the
old doctrine of straight out pio
tection as something unfaahiona
ble have no comprehension of the
situation which this country must
confront at the termination of the
war. These persons Mr Hughes
must educate.
Are not the signs of the times
enough to convince doublers that
there will be no time for a traiff
commission
j
I
j
I
of
a
commission to mess and muddle
over a situation which will require
immediate statecraft! Our present
tariff schedules will be uo protec
tiou for this country against the
vast accumulation of goods s:oted
up abroad: Protection will be
needed against the Prussians most
of all. And there will be no pro
tection unless Mr. Hughes forces
the issue.
It will not do to say that Prus
aia cannot take the seas as her
merchant marine is depleted, for
that would be untrue. A greatei
fleet of ships than existed before
the war is being built, aud these
will come with full cargoes, bring,
mg in cheaply produced goods
that will simply swamp the Amer,
tcans manufacturers, who are pro
ducing at high cost of labor, mate
rial and transportation. Wake
up, Mr. Hughes!—New York Her.

HE BUCKS AGAIN.
Old man Tax Payer, the com.
monity borden bearer, has again
asserted himself. This time it
was in Jennings. The cause
which required the extra taxation,
a new school bonze and additional
fonds for its maintenance, was a
most worthy one. But for some
reason, and evidently a weighty
one, the taxpayers rose up aod
bit the proposition with a set;ing
maul, square between the eyes
and killed it too dead to kick
We do not know the reasons
which impelled such a course of
action, but we have a sneaking
idea that the people were right.—

BRUTAL POLICEMEN
TO BE PUNISHED.
The brutal aud unwarranted as
santt by two New Oilcans police
[ men npoo Dr. B L. Lucketr of
Gbeneyvilie and bis tpotLer G 13
Luckeit of Alexandria, will be
punished to the limit. Mayor
Martin Behrman, who makes a
practice of upholding public em.
ployes when right, is »qually em
pliatic in "going after" them
when they are wrong. The case
against Patrolmen Saiautn aud
Prados is flagrant and the Mayor
has not only suspended aud pre
ferred charges against them, but
announces that be will see that
they get all they deserve.
WAR MEDALS
OR A BALLOT.
An eighteeu.year old giri bas
been twice decorated with medals
giri
been twice decorated with medals
for bravery. Her name is Bmi
tienne Moreau. The decorations
are in recognition of the girl's
conduct during the fighting at
Loos when she refused shelter in
a cave and for twenty four hours
tended the wounded onder fire.
She possesses the British wai
medal given for field service and
the French War Cross. Neither
France nor Great Britain has ye;
given heroines the right to ei-j
press an opinion at the ballot box.
What do« 5 'on tbiuk either govern
ment would do if Miss Moreau, on
election day braved the perils of
the polling booth and dropped a
war medal in the ballot box! How
these aoinilitary elec'ion judgee
would rash to protect her from
such an unwomanly act!
"Colonel Bob Ingersoli once re
marked", recalled the Kansan
City Journal, "If 1 owned lleli
aod Texas, I would live tu Hell
aod reel Texas out." Well, one
thing's certain, Bob isn't living io
Texas now. \
