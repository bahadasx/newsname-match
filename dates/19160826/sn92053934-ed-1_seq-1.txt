PRIEST IS KILLED
IN WINDOW FALL
i
Father Tomazin Plunged to Death j
iroci Sixth Story ot Hotel
Sherman.
Chicago, Aug. 25. Rev. Ignatius
Tomazin, 70, formerly parish priest at
St. Anthony's German Catholic church
in Albany, Minn., fell from a sixth
story window of the Hotel Sherman
today and was Instantly killed. Rev.
Tomazin was relieved n parisJij'rk
about July 24. Hotel employes say
the priest has been acting strangely
since coming to Chicago.
A letter was found in Rev. Toma-
zin's room addressed to Miss Martha
McCluskey, his aged housekeeper. The
letter is incoherent and meaningless.
According to witnesses, the body
struck between the horses hitched to
a garbage wagon, catching on the
reins and tearing the bits from their
mouths.
The priest's neck was broken and he
is believed to have died instantly.
Miss Martha McCluskey, for 16
years housekeeper of the aged priest,
said she believed Rev. Tomazin com
mitted suicide while brooding over
his church affairs. A letter, believed
to have been intended for her, was
found in the priest's room.
"Don't be scared," It read, "I am
alright. Take the next train. Take
all your things and my things for bag
gage. I am waiting for you." The
letter was unsigned.
The priest. Miss McCluskey said,
had been acting strangely for several
days. After his resignation on July
"3, she said, they went to St. Paul and
arrived here Tuesday.
"Rev. Tomazin had trouble with his
parishioners for five years since he
took charge of the church," she ,said.
"One night three of the parishioners
came to Father Tomazin's parish and
beat him. That caused him to resign.
It broke his heart, I think."
Miss McCluskey who is middle aged,
was asleep in another part of the
hotel when the priest's lifeless body
was found.

Federal Board of Mediation
Issues Significant State
ment. VfashJngton, Ane. 25 With ne
gotiations for averting the threat
ened railway strike practically at
a deadlork. President Wilson to
day suddenly went to the rapltol
and conferred with administration
leaders over tho possibility of
legislation.
The president conferred first with
Democratic Leader Kern and Chair
man Newlands of the senate commerce
committee, who, it was understood,
after a canvass of the congressional
situation, had concluded it was feas
ible to get through congress before
adjournment as an amendment to the
pending bill to increase tho member
ship of the interstate commerce com
mission some sort of an expression
that the railways should be authorized
to make rate Increases to meet higher
wages and to provide some sort of ma
chinery for arbitration for similar dis
putes in the future, possibly along the
lines of the Canadian commission.
Just before the president went to tho
capitol the brotherhood leaders, Impa
tient at the delay of the railroad exec
utives in replying to the president's
last proposal, declared that only the
unqualified concessions on the eight
hour day. or some action by congress
to cause the government to operate tho
railroads could prevent the threatened
strike:- ' - -
On all hands tho president's visit to
the capitol was taken as Indicating that
the situation had reached a crisis.
Among the railway executives It was
said that any plan for legislation sug
gested by the president would havo to
be considered, but that the inclination
of the railway heads was to stand sol
idly on their demand of arbitration of
the present dispute.
Railroad Attitude Unchanged.
Late this afternoon tho railroad ex
ecutives adjourned without having fin
ished their statement to President Wil
son and their attitude was announced
as unchanged.
Later, it was learned at tho capitol
that the president told the senators
the railroad executives had "put It up
to him" to get some guarantee from
congress that they would be permitted
to get more revenue to meet tho In
crease in wages. It was said no
means of accomplishing that end was
agreed upon.
The executives have been told that
the men's leaders expect to have dif
ficulty In restraining them after to
night. Tho proposal of the presi
dents, as has been outlined unoffi
cially, declines to concede the eight
hour day without arbitration and In
vestigation of its application to rail
roading, but makes some concessions
as to collateral Issues. The effect of
this proposal will bo to pass tho is
sue back to the brotherhoods.
Some of the railway executives say
their proposition is positively their
last; some of the men's leaders stand
firmly against arbitration. Others on
both sides have hopes that out of It
will come further negotiations, delay
ing a strike and possibly averting It.
A statement issued by the federal
board of mediation today on tho settle
ments it had conducted was regarded
as significant. It described a report
about to be made to the senate which
will disclose that in every case of set
tlements conducted under the old Krd
man act or the later Newlands law
substantial advantages have been won
by the employes through arbitration.
The only instance recorded where tho
men did not benefit was a settlement
made without tho participation of th
federal mediators.
