Plant Crimson Clover to Improve Your

Clemson, College, Aug. 23.?This is
a crop that you can't afford to pass
up. It is hardy and does well on most
of our Southern soil. It Is used ex?
tensively for grazing. The vines turn?
ed under makes one of the best soil
Improvers you can get. It adds much
i humud and nitrogen to Jhe soil, and
therefore increases the yield of corn,
cotton or any other crop that may bo
planted1 after the clover Is turned un?
der. It can he grazed in the fall and
spring and then the stubble turned
under,, and excellent results are ob?
tained as a fertilizer for the following
crop. The price of seed Is small con?

TO STUDY' FARM LIFE.
D. R. Johnson Calls on President to
Emphasize Value of Such n Body.
Washington, Aug. 23.?Dr. D. B.
Johnson, president of the National
Education association, today called
to see President Wilson as chairman
of a committee recently named for
this purpose to urge the appointment
of a commission to study farm life.
After leaving the White House, Dr.
Johnson said that he and other mem?
bers of the committee had been most
cordially received and that they felt
much encouraged in the efforts being
made to have a commission appoint?
ed to study farm life conditions.
"It is our belief." Dr. Johnson said,
"that much may be done toward
making the farm life of the people
generally, but most especially the
Women who live on the farms, bet?
ter in many ways. What we want to
do is to make the farm so much liked
that hereafter there will be no prob?
lem Involved In making it attractive.
This rould be accomplished through
the medium of a commission such as
is proposed by the National Education
association ami we hope to be suc?
cessful In <?l,t' efforts."

CAN SEE END OF WAR.
Lloyd-George Thinks it in Sight Now.
Ixmdon, Aug. 22.?"The French and
British have captured positions on tho
Somme front whence the course of
the campaign is visible," said David
Lloyd-George In tho house of com?
mons today, "and I think in the dim
distance wo can see the end."
"France is equipped and Russia is
rapidly becoming equipped," said the
munitions minister, and "Italy's
equipment has' amazed her best
friends. Germany has missed her
chance ?nd she knows It."
Mr. Lloyd-Geoge contrasted what
he termed the extraordinary change
in two months in the relative posi?
tions of the entente allies and the cen?
tral powers on all fronts except
Mesopotamia, where climatic condi?
tions had hindered the British. He
denounced as unjustified criticisms of
Eritish operations in France on the
ground of their failure to break
through the German lines.
"The Germdns, having two alterna
1 tives, chose that of bringing troops
and guns from Verdun to prevent the
allies breaking through," he said.
"That suited our purposes. It reliev?
ed tho pressure on Verdun and pre?
vented the,enemy pouring forces into
the Russian theatre to use against
Gen. Brussiloffs thrust.'

FARMER'S FINE DEFENSE.
Tells Editor Why He Gets Goods
From a Mail Order House.
Recently a merchant of Natchez
happened to see a farmer receive a
box at the depot and noticed that it
was from a mall order house. He al?
so! noticed that the goods were right
in his line and the same as he carried
for years. He immediately approached
the farmer and said.
"I could have sold you the goods
you have here for less money than
the Chicago hause and saved you the
freight."
"Then why didn't you do so?" said
the farmer. "I have taken the local
paper for a year and have not seen a
line about your selling these or any
other goods. This mail order house
sends advertising matter to me asking
for my trade, and gets it. If you
have any bargains, why don't you put
them in the paper so we can see what
they are?"?Natchez (Miss.) Demo?

clemson college notes
The bursting of the Lake Toxaway
dam occasioned considerable loss to
jthe college by causing the Seneca
! River to overflow a large tract of
i bottom land belonging to the col?
lege. However, the flood was less
serious in this immediate section
than was generally expected It
would be.
Indications are that there will be
a normal attendance at the college
next year. Already a full number of
applications for the regular four
courses have been received.
This is Horticulture Week at the
Summer School. Interesting instruc?
tions are being given about the dif?
ferent kinds of fruits and vegetables
growing on the college grounds and
at the Experiment Station; and both
field and class-room work is being
done.
Manning Strong Everywhere.
, One Sumter man has received these
expressions among his mail within the
last 24 hours.
From Barn well?The former sup?
porters of Gov. Manning who arc
against him now are men who have
not much weight. In going over the
precincts of this county I figure that
Mr. Manning will get about 1,100;
Blease 8 50; Cooper 4 50.
From Oconee?Things are looking
up for "Richard I." in this county. I
predict he will get two to three-iifths
of the votes here.
From Union?Friends were delight?

heretofore doubtful county. Renum?

FIRST TRAIN OVER ASHLEY RIV

Charleston, Aug. 2T djushing nine

I plcted some ti tgo and has been
! in daily use section foremen's
lever cars.
The crushed granite hauled yester?
day will be used on the ballast decks,
of the trstle on the west side of the
stream. This work is being carried
steadily forward so that when the
! line is open all the way to Savannah
jail the permanent trestles will have
ballast decks, an innovation in rail?
roading in this section of the country.
The drawbridge on the Edisto river
has been completed and the draw
j bridge at "Second Stono" will be
ready in the course of a few days.
, Soon after the drawbridge for "Sec?
ond Stono" will be placed. Within
ten days, it is expected, the line will
be open as far as the Ashepoo river.
Work trains will then be constantly
operated over the Ashley, Stono and
Edisto river drawbridges.
Good progress is reported on the
trestle and bridge for the Broad
river for Beaufort. Indications are
that the whole of the Charleston
Savannah link will be open before
the first of October. This does not
mean, however, that passenger service
will begin so early in the fall.
It Is expected * that freight trains
will be operated over the Charleston
Savannah link for several weeks be?
fore passenger service is arranged.
For a time, of course, only accom?
modation passenger trains will be
run, the service to be similar to the
Charleston-Hamlet service.
Beware of Mail-Order Catalogues''
Spend Your Money at Home.
'Citizens of Sumter County:
"Beware of mail-order catalogues."
H^^ever^, we recognize ..the rlfhfc^
of every mkn to spend his
money where he pleases; we cannot
hold that people ought to trade at
home simply because our people are
home folks. Your merchant's goods
are in competition with the open
market, if the mail-order houses can
and do sell cheaper than them; you
have a right to send away for your
goods. But do they?
For several years the mail order
houses have thrown out the sugges?
tion that your home merchants are
I robbing you and as we swallow this
I bait the mail-order people, in propor
' tion, inflate their prices while reducing
I at the same time the quality of their
I goods. It is our desire for every man
I to figure thi3 out for himself. Do not
{take one particular article only but
go through their catalogues and figure
your daily needs. Figure the final
cost delivered in your home. Figure
the worth of your money cash In ad?
vance. Figure the lack of service,
"We are out of this, will ship later, or,
I we have substituted." Figure the an
inoyance thron go delayed arrival and
you like others will figure from 10 to
I 35 per cent cash in your pocket by
! giving your home merchant the op?
portunity to supply your every want.
In a few days we will mail to every
box in the county a copy of The Home
Builder in which we give absolute
proof as to the method of mall order
humhuggery by destroying through
comparison their great offer of 33 1-3
! pounds of best graulated sugar for
one dollar. Be sure you get your copy;
'convince your self of the truth, then
' be a good fellow and join the ranks
of Home Boosters. With best wishes,

COTTON CONDITION POOR.
Dry Weather Has Further Injured the
( rop?Cem Poing Weil.
Colombia, Aug. 23.?The weather
during the past week has been too
dry, and all crops outside of the re?
cently main flooded districts need
rain. Cotton continues generally In
unsatisfactory condition, with shed?
ding and rust in large areas and slow
fruiting; the picking of the early crop
has become more general; the late
crop needs rain to develop squares.
Corn on the whole Is doing well, but
copious rains would greatly Improve
the late crop. Much hay and fodder
were saved during the week, which
was especially favorable for curing.
Forage pens, sweet potatoes and corn
are In gon?i condition.
