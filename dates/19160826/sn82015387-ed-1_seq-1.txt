CONFESSES HE
SET FIRE TO
RESIDENCE OF
MRS. PAYNE
Mystery Surrounding Burn
ing of This Beautiful
Place Revealed.
W. I. EL TELLS HOW
HE PUT OIL ON FLOOR
Pronounced a Paretic and
Irresponsible by Commis
lion of Phyiicians.
On the evening of December 31,
1915, the Covington d'ire Departmnent
was called to fight fire at the beauti
ful residence of Mrs. C. J. Payne, on
the Mdllitay Roat.l' Thaf reO had
gained' suah readwdw that tlhe build
dug could not be saved. The fire was
said to have been caused by the ex
plosion of a lampq this story having
been given out by Mr. Ellis, a step
brother of Mrs. Payne, who was the
only one home at the .ime.
Last Monday evening, August 21,
Mr. Ellis canme. to Oovington. He
had evidently been 'drinking. He
saw Sheriff Brewstdlland asked him
about the dog lieeng5s to be issued
under the new law. IMr. Brewster
told him that they would 'be ready in
a few days. Some time after the
Parkview Theatre fjad closed Monday
night Mr. Brewstek received a phone
message asking tqr an interview at
the insurance ioalie. of the Nilbon
,Frederick Company, that Mr. Ellis
had seanething to, say to him. ,Mr.
Brewster coneluide ; that it was
aomething more *bout the dog law,
as he had been bothered coasiderab. -
with this question, especially as to
the ppiso.lasg of dogs, but being in
formed that the matter was of coln
siderable importance and could not
w wait, he went down to the insurance
oflee and found Mr. Nilson and Mr.
Allis awaiting him. Mr. Nilson
handed him the following confession
signed by Mr. Ellis:
"August 21, 1916.
*'Tb' tie Hea. Dist. Atty. St. Tam
*any Ph.:
'To the Hon Sheriff St. Tammany
Parish:
'Jasper E. Nilson, Agt. L. and L.
and G. Ins. Co.:
'"Dear Sire:-I, the undersigned,
set dre to Mrs. C. J. Payne's resi
dence on Military Road Dec. 31st,
1415, 7:30 p. m. for reasons verbally
given Hon. Dist. Atty.
(Signed) "W. E. ELLIS."
Sheriff Brewster thought the whole
thing was a joke.
"What is this?" he asked.
"It's my confession,' answered
Pulls.
"'Do you mean it? Did y'o write
this?" questioned the sheriff.
"Yes; I wrote t,"' said Ellis.
It began to dawn upon the sheriff
that matters were really serious and
that a man was confessing that he
had set fire 't the Paysi residence,
an incident that had almost been
forgotten.
Turning the coanfession over, Sheriff
Brewster asked Ellis to Sign his
name on the bac)c of it. Ellia did so
and the signatures proved tJ be rahke
There was nothing to do but to lock
Ellis up and get in touch with Judge
Carter. This Sheriff Brewste? d:d
over the telephone, and Judge Carter
same to Covington Tuesdai morning
and examined Ellis, with the result
that Dr. F. F. Young, Sr., and Cro
ner Bulloch were appointed a eom
mission to examine into his sanity.
In the meantime Sheritf Brewster
had visited Ellis that morning, with
a view to ascertaining if .he would
cling to his eonfession la sober con
dition. All that Ellis had sald the
night before he again repeated. He
said he had set fire to the building
by pouring oil over the bathroom
floor and lighting it. His reasons
for Confessing nere that he was
haunted by the ruins and degsolation
of the once beautiful bh'ome. lIe
could not bear to look upon them.
He would feel better satlsfed with
the matter off.his mind, even it he
went to the jenitentiary.
The report ct the commission was
that Ells was irresponsible for h
aset. Dr. Young, who has made a
stady of mental diseases, stated that
lEllis was a paretic. That his m;nd
mdight be compared to that of achild
of seven years. That he was incur
able.
It is not even certain that E!lis did
set fire to the buildng. He may be
laboring under a haluoination.
Ellis will be taken to some Insti
tution where he will be cared for

FINAL WIND-UP OF

Dance and Distribution of_
Prizes at Gymnasium
Hall Tonight.
Tennis has become the all-absorb
ing game of Covington. If you want
to be in the swim you must lbe a
tennis fiend; you must' play tennis
and dream tennis and you must be
willing to get up early in the mosra- 1
ing when the birds are inging their
dirst call, and you must forego the
early supper or 5he late dinner, as
the case may be. The result is that
there are more rosy cheeks and
tough muscles, more elastic steps
and hearty handshakes, more ex
panded lungs and bright eyes than
Covington has known for many s
year.
Crowds have been witnessing the
tournament that will be closed to
day, and even at 6 o'clock in the
morning enthusiasts might have been
seen stepping :t out to the tennis
grounds to see some of the crack
players swing the racket with that
remarkable accuracy that produces
the inshoot, the outshoot, the drop
and the many other puzzling curves
that are a part of the scientiftic re
sults of good tennis playing.
The beautiful silver cups in the
window of P. E. Smith's jewelry
I store have been viewed silth admirn
ing eyes by the paIsers' by. These
prises will be awarded at the dance
to be given by the club at the high
school gymnauium hall tonight.

'A grand stand will be built in rear

visitors who are food of eud.or

of this kind.
It is contemapiated putting in a

an assured thing.
The Empire eoops have been adopt
ed for the poultry department. These
coops will be furnished free to ex
hibitors, and aft the best exhibition
coops that can be obiafaed. There
will be concessions made to members
of poultry clubs. here are thirty
eight oative members of poultry

Two bloksk have been shelled on
the street ledling from Covington to

will be shelled by the town and two
by the Associaetion of Commeree.
This will complete a shelled street

Another featute of interest is that
the Boy Scouts will camp at the fair
grounds. While this orgalusation is
recent, there has been eonsiderdble
enthusiasm and the work has been
taken up with vigor and there is
quite a anrge membership.
There will be ball games between
Cov4nlton, ranSklltos, Oldell and
Bogalues. It ha also been proposed
that the Slidell Band attend the fair
and assist the Covlngton Munietpal
Beand in providing mueae at the

has also been invited to aid in the

in the fair, and in the athletie even4.
Governor Pleasant has been in
vited to be present..but bms not yet
made it known whether he will be

Public comfort Is a matter that
will receive special attention, and we
-believe visitors will have more con

other comforts than at any previous

REGINENT OF NATIONAL GUARS ON -THE *AM
FARMERS' LOAN
ASSOCIATION
APPEALS TO
FARMERS
One of the Largest Gather
ings of Farmers Ever
in Court Building.
The meeting at the courtboaus last
Thursday, at which the Federal Land
hba k was discussed, was one of the
Iais,est meetings of farmer. thast we
huve had .n Covington. Mr. W. J.
L.ppert discussed this new fe'er1l
loan propos-tion in all its de:.jili, aidt
it was ge-erally agreed Ina: the
Federal La id Bank wis an mna :tu
ti:.n that was much needed in L:+niti
ar.a and that a large num'Jer .1 ftrHn
ers would thereby 'be enabled to es
,tablish themselves in profitable farm
leg operations.
The measure is also meeting the
support of the bankers of St. Tatm
many parish as well as the business
men. Most of the prominent men
aI 'Covington were present. Ccnm
missioner Deneehaud was also in at
tendance, but the time was given
principally to the address of Mr. Lep
pert, who interestingly and clearly
outlined the object and worki:gi of
the bank.
If New Orleans gets the bank, and
she is positively entitled to it, there
is no doubt that it will be 'liberally
patronlsed in this section. The or
ganisatilon of a Farm Loan Associa
tion will simply be a formality. The
sentiment for its organization and
participation in its loan features is
assured.
Associationof Com
merce Listens to
Talk of Mr. H.K
S. Herring.
Mr. H. S. Herring, of the New Or
leans hoard of Traae, was a guest of
the Covington Association of Com
merce at its meeting last Monday
evening. iMr. 'Herring consented to
address the members and talked very
interestlngly of the kind of work that
should come before bodies of that
kind, and of the means of accom
plishing things and sustaining inter
est in civic affairs. He is an advo
cite of the merging of all bodies,
farming as well as 6ommercial, so as
to bring together all forces for the
aceomplishment of any object, and
that one thing should be taken at a
time anl efforts concentrated on this
object il it is either ascomplishei
or hountd to be impracticable.
Mr. Herring's talk was very much
appreciated and was listened to w
interest. He spends considerable
time in Covington during the sum
mer months and is Interested} in its
welfare.
The Concert at Rest

On Monday, August 28th, the last
