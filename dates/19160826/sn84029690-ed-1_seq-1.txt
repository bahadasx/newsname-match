You hope that in the future you will have more leisure
and more property than, you have now.
That is a worthy ambition. The only way to realize it
Jis to reserve a part of your earnings and turn them into
capital. They become so even while drawing interest, and
they are at hand when a way for more productive invest
ment opens.
Begin'making that capital now.

A FEW SUBSTANTIAL FACTS
Concerning Our Growing City and
the Bright Prospects for Its
Future Greatness and
Prosperity.
Swing outward, ye gates of the future,
Swing inward, ye gates of the past,
Old Fort Hays, the gem of the prairie,
Will be crowned with true greatness at
last.
The Union Pacific railroad committee
of the Booster Club of Hays, met last
Friday, in Hays, in conference with
a delegation of U. P. officials. Among
the officers present were, R. L. Davis,
of Kansas City, Supt. of the Kansas
division; F. I. Merrill, Master Mechan
ic, and James Thomas, Assist. Supt.
Among other important things talked
of was the moving of the elevators and !
lumber yards from the railroad prop-'
rr
thf.
center of the business district of thej
!
city.
, , . , ww ..
lroad officials agreed that lf
The rai
the citizens interested would move
. . . , , . , t
their business interests, that they (the
officials) would see to it that Hays,
the very near future, had a new, mod
ern and up-to-date depot, and also that
they would move their yards farther
east, park and beautify the grounds m
the vicinity of the depot, which would
mean a beauty spot in the center of
the city from Ash to Oak street.
Fred Schwaller of the Schwaller s
Sons lumber yard, has agreed to move
their lumber business to some other site
in the city, if the other interested busi-,
ness men
Will QO me same. ine t
elevator people also agree to move if
the balance will. Now,1, if the Wheat
land Elevator Company will move their
plpvator from Fort street, the Treat & !
Shaffer Lumber Co., the Maddens, and j
the Farmers Cooperative Company ;
will move their elevators, the thing will !
be accomplished, and what Hays espe- j
riallv needs a. new deDOt will soon OS
a fact and not an unrealized probtem.
We believe that every citizen has the j Nothing to da but draw down asa:ar;
best intcrestrof-the City at heart, and j of f 1S5 per, looks i like a sua.
that each of the interests mentioned 1 - Elvin Penney and Ralph Nicholson,
will rise to the call of duty and patriot- visited friends at Coliyer, Sunday.
ism and get in line with those who have
agreed to move.
Of course, it will cost considerable, j
but what is the cost when compared to j
the general welfare and upbuilding of
the city. The time is coming, and is
not far distant, when Chestnut street
will have to be widened. It should be
widened before paving is put down,
otherwise, the expense will be greater.
Hays City, the beautiful, the coming
metropolis of the West, is fast assum
ing city proportions is the connoiseur
of all eyes. Inquiries are coming from
far and near. Capital is looking to j
Hays for investment and with the ad- i
vent of the Anthony & Northern, Hays j
will spread out, new additions will be
added, new business interests will be
located, and new blood will be infused
into our commercial veins.
There are a number of men and wo
men still living here who can remember
when Hays, figuratively speaking, was j
a mere fly-speck on the map of the
state populated principally, by booted
and spurred cowmen, whose constant
companion was a six-shooter, which
was about all the law that was recog
nized.
"Then the saloon the bar to decency,
the road to hell held sway in the em
bryo city and in fact, with the "six
gun," was the abrogators of the des
tinies of the populace. Now all that
has been changed. Churches and
schools have taken the place of the sa
loon, and justice, reason and sobriety,
the place of the ever-ready revolver,
and no city the size of Hays can boast
of a more sober, sane, industrious, law
abiding citizenship, who, xwith. their
money and brains, are always ready
and alert to help push our growing city
to the front. Note the following im
provements, mostly of recent date:
- Hays has one of the best sewer
systems in the state, excellent light
and telephone systems, all of -which
have cost the citizens large sums
of money; the Fort Hays Experiment
Station, the largest one of the kind in
the world; the Fort Hays Normal
School; the Sheridan Coliseum which
will cost when completed $125,000;
Catholic Hospital, $125,000; New Opera
House, $10,000; fair ground buildings
new and modern, which will cost prob
ably $15,000; new bank building comer
of Chestnut and Juniata, $o,000; the
prospective new government postoffice
building to co3t not less than o0,000;
new $2,000 steam laundry; the new
High School building, $50,000; the An
thony and Northern railroad with ade
quate terminal buildings, street paving
and the numerous other improvements
which will naturally follow.
Let us all boost for a greater and
a better Kays, not occasionally, but all
the time. - " -

The town was shocked to learn of the

One week ago he was tak
taken

i tack of his rupture. At last the symp
tons were so marked that a doctcr was
I called. The doctor immediately in
! formed the family there was but little
'. hope. Mr. Garrett was taken to the
j hospital, an operation was performed,
; but the doctors found the conditions
worse than they had anticipated, and
on V.'edneidav at 1-20 d m Mr' Gar-
rtt riassorJ imair
Richard Garrett was born April 5,
! 1S51, ia the state of Pennsylvania. At
; the age cf fifteen he moved with his
; parents to Virginia. Here he grew to
; young manhood, and in the spring of
1S77 he came to Kansas,
j lie was married to Miss Pearl Coo
: per, March 2, 1SS7. They moved to
1 Dorrance, Kansas. Here Mr. Garrett
j entered actively into business, rnd for
j twenty-five years he was one of the
leading merchants. He was a success
ful business man, and through careful
, management became one of the wealthy
' men of the town. Two vears ago he,
; with his family, moved to Havs, so his
; children could have the advantages cf
the schools.
Twenty-two years ago he was con
verted and -joined the Methodist church.
He leaves a wi.e and four children to
mourn. The children are Mrs. Mvrl
i Friemmel of Dorrance, Mildred, Alta
j and Dewey M., also a brother at To
i peka and a sister at Abilene, survive
him.
j The funeral was held at Dorrance,
j where Mr. Garrett was buried. The
j officiating minister was Rev. Feiler of
j Hutchinson, Kansas,
j Mr. Garrett was a man of few words.
I He always attended strictly to his own
business. He was a kind husband and
' an indulgent father. He will be greatly
. missed by his family and his many
! friends.
Scalded to Death.
Cleo "Lacy, the infant son of James
Brumitt, was scalded so severely
, Tuesday, August 22, 1916, that he
died the same day at the Hays hospital.
Mrs. Brumitt was doing the family
I washing and the little one, 'who was
playing near her, in some manner
j pulled out the drainage plug to the
washing machine and the hot water
scalded him so severely that dsath re
sulted as above stated. The funeral
was held at the heme qf Erastu3 Brum
itt, Wednesday afternoon, Rev. E. O.
Rogers cf the Baptist church, officiat
ing. Miss Ethel Robinson sang two
soles, "Safe in the Arms of Jesus"
and "Nearer My God to Thee." The
little one was born July 10. 1915.
j A Word to Parents.
j The public school "begins Tuesday,
September 5. It is extremely impor-
tant that th children begin the -year's
i the free, active life of the vacation
i period the confinement and work of the
r , , .. , ,
; school room will tend to develop and
may exist. The general physical con
dition of the children should receive
careful attention. . -
Any indication of a diseased condition
of ' the eyc-s, ears, throat or teeth
should ie noted. It is especially urged
that all children visit the dentist before
the opening of school and have a thor
ough examination of the teeth. The
dentists will keep records of such ex-
r rri P. 1 1 1 ri n sinrl if" Tint" hp nc9rv
j j
to repeat ine examination at tne
school. Examinations can be conducted
ore satisfactorily at the dental office
than at school.
Good health is at the foundation of
the child's welfare and progress. "An
ounce of prevention is worth a pound
cure." ' ,

The United States Census Statistics
CONTAINS SOME INTERESTING FIGURES
These figures show that sixty-six, read it, (66) out
of 100 people dying in the Onited States have ab
solutely no estate. They die penniless.
Of the remaining thirty-four (34) persons, twenty-five
die with less than $1300, and only nine (9)
persons in one hundred (100) have more than $5000
when they die.
The above figures are not estimates, idle guesses
or fiction, they are the facts, arrived at by the U.

A Relic L Border Days.
The small boys of Hays find much
pastime in searching for relics reminia.
cent cf the days of General Custer,
along the shores of Big Creek and out
about the grounds of the building,
formerly occupied by Custer sstd Ijl feJ.r
Law officers. LVnpiy caxtrvVres, bilteti,
army buttons and canteen? have been
found and some of the urchins, with"
an eye to business, have coined not a '
little hard cash from eastern people
for these trophies of the days when
Hays gave shelter to Buffalo Bill, Wild
Bill and other heroes of the Frontier.
But Master Bryant Hale feels that
the other youngsters who haunt the
scenes made famous by these heroes of
by-gone days, have nothing over him
as holders of souvenirs with "Caster'
associations since his "find" of last
Sunday afternoon, while strotting
along the shores of Big Creek in com
pany with others of his kind. It is a cav
alryman's sword, straight and clean
cat and save a rust decay which gives
a ragged edge, is in an almost perfect
j state of preservation, Bryant is very
proud of his "find," but is going to be
magnanimous enough to permit Prof.
Sullivan to have it in the loan depart
ment of the Normal museum. Possibly
a second sword a broken one may be
found if further search is made. Per
haps a duel was fought on that lonely
spot over some beautiful Indian maid
for all we know. The only wonder i
that the found sword should hare Iain
so long undiscovered. It was laying in
a thicket near the running water, the
hilt and upper part fully exposed to
view, and, as no cavalrymen have been
here since the days of Custer, this
sword has lain where found in the sun
and rain of over f orty years.

Another
Awful Accident
Caused by
Gasoline.
The people of Haj-s were horrified
Thursday evening, when they learned
I one most appalling accidents
j that has ever occurred within our midst.
Mrs. William Roenfeldt who was
alone, lit the gasoline stove preparatory
to getting the evening meal. It is sup
posed that it blazed cp and was about
to reach the .tank, when she seized it
and ran out of doors in an effort to save
the home," and in so doing her clothing
caught and was entirely burned from
her body before any assistance arrived.
The near neighbors saw what seemed
to them -a large ball of flames. They
rushed to the scene and hurriedly sum
moned medical aid. Drs. Middlekaaff
and Haas were there in an instant.
They did all that could be done, but
death relieved her suffering about three
hours after the accident. - She was con
scious and talked to her daughter, Mrs.
Wagner, and husband before her death.
Mrs. Roenfeldt was sixty-six years of
age; a woman whose heart was in her
hesis and family. She was a most ex
cellent character. -
