G. O. P. STARTS WORK
TO GET MOOSE VOTE
Chicago, Aug. 26—Active work to
bring all progressives in the western
states back into the republican ranks
was begun today by Harold I. Ickes
of Illinois, in charge of the work of
organizing the progressive vote at
western republican national cam
paign headquarters.
Within a. week progressive leaders
In every state between Ohio and the
Pacific coast will be asked to make
a detailed report on local conditions.
Where sharp difference of opinion is
found between the republican leaders
and progressives, efforts toward prac
tical consolidation will be made.
The plan is to send influential pro

WILSON PLAN CALLED
GOLDEN RULE POLICY
Watervllle. Me., Aug. 26.—Vigorous
praise for the administration's Eur
opean and Mexican policies was the
outstanding feature of an address here
by Secretary of War Newton D. Bak
er, principal speaker at a meeting
late yesterday in connection with the
Democratic campaign in Maine In be
half of President Wilson. The
Ident'a cOuifce, Mr. Baker
infused the spirit of the Dec1
of Independence and of the golden
rule into this country's foreign rela
tions.
"The administration has kept the
peace." said Mr. Baker. "It has done
unto Mexico as we would be done by.
It has maintained friendly relations
with the European belligerents and
placed this country in a position from
which at the end of the great Euro
pean struggle the moral forces of the
United States can be exercised in the
interests of justice and humanity.
"Large problems He before us in the
next four years. The reconstruction
must take place. No unfamiliar hand
should be put in to guide the course
of our nation during that period. No
uncertain voice should be permitted to
speak our spirit at the council table
that reorganized the universe."
Mr. Baker expressed the hope that
American soldiers on the Texas bor
der may not be required to fire anoth
er shot, "but that their ultimate vic
tory and the restoration of peace and
contentment and prosperity in north
ern Mexico may come as the climax
to a series of bloodless victories."

Mesaba Range Strike
Situation Improves
Virginia, Minn., Aug. 26.—The
Mesaba range strike situation is
showing steady improvement, officials
said yesterday. Few meetings are be

sheriffs daily as he does not need
them any longer. He returned to
Duluth for the week-end, satisfied, he
said, that his presence was not needed
here Sunday.
There is very little picketing on the
range, according to the sheriff. A
strikers' newspaper Issued from Hib

the aid of Carlo Tresca, Sam Scarlett
and the six other alleged I. w. W.
whose cases are believed to have been

CRUSHING BLOW
Attempt to Encircle Left
Flank of Russians
Fails.
Petrograd. Aug. 26.—The Turkish
attempt to encircle the left flank of
the Russian Caucasian army, appears
to have received a crushing blow
from the troops of Grand Duke Nich
olas in the region of Lake Van. The
Turkish encircling scheme aimed at
regaining Erzerum and thus nullify
ing all the Grand Duke's victories In
Turkish Armenia, appeared about to
succeed, but the Russian reoccupation
of Mush and re-establishment of Rus
sian positions west of Lake Van ap
parently lias made hopeless the Turk
ish efforts.
The initiative now appears again to
be with the Russians at all important
points in Asia Minor and now that the
Turkish offensive on the left flank has
been stopped. Grand Duke Nicholas
can continue his march toward Asia
Minor.
AVIATOR MAKES
ANEW RECORD
Passenger-Carrying Time
Mark is Broken by
Carlstrom.
Newport News, Va.. Aug. 26.—A
new world's record for distance cov
ered in ten hours carrying a passen
ger waB made yesterday by Victor
Carlstrom of the Atlantic coast aero
nautical station., who made 661 miles
flying in a Curtiss twin motor land
and water machine. His actual fly
ing time was eight hours and forty
minutes.
Officials of the station expect Carl
strom's feat to win the Curtiss avia
tion cup. which was awarded last year
for a flight of less than R00 miles.
They eaid the other prizes or bonuses
won by the aviator would amount to
$7,000.
The machine's engines were stopped
only twice during the day. A heavy
fog made steering by the compass
necessary. The flight was made in
a lapse of fifty miles each, covering a
trip from the station to Fisherman's
Island and return.

Washington. Aug. 26.—Among
the brotherhood officials late today,
it was declared that only an un
qualified concession by the rail
roads of the eight-hour day or ac
tion of congress taking over the
railways for government operation
could prevent the threatened strike.
Wilson went to flip capltol, pre
sumably in connection with the
strike situation. The trip to the
capltol was wholly unexpected. Wil
son summoned to his office Demo
cratic Leader Kern and Chairman
"ewlands of the senate commerce
commission, who have charge in
the senate of legislation affecting
Interstate roads.
Although it was known that
Wilson came to discuss threatened aJ
strike legislation, the specific pur
pose was kept seem.
Wilson returned to the White
House without a further confer
ence. Xewlands stated positively
that no joint session of congress
wa arranged.
Late in the afternoon, the rafl

Washington, Aug. 26.—The threat
ened strike situation took on added
tensity today a.® railway executives
continued deliberations over the form
of their counter proposal to President
Wilson's plan, with the brotherhood
leaders silently awaiting the next
move. The executives have been told'
that the men's leaders expect diffi
culty in restraining them after to
night.
Executives worked steadily on their
statement to Wilson, but this after
noon had taken no final vote on it.
It had been outlined unofficially. It
declines to concede the eight-hour
day without arbitration, and Investi
gation of its application to railroad
ing, but makes some concessions as
to collateral issues. The effect of the
executives' counter-proposal will be
to pass the issue back to the brother
hoods.
Some railway executives say their
proposition Is positively their last, and
some of the men's leaders stand firmly
against arbitration. Others on both
sides have hopes that out of it will
come further negotiations, delaying
a strike and possibly averting it. The
statement issued by the federal board
of mediation today on the settlements
it had conducted was regarded as sig
nificant.
It described the report about to be
made to the senate, which will dis
close that in every case of settlements
conducted under the old Erdman act
or the later Xewlands law, substantial
advantages have been won by em
ployes through arbitration. The only
instance recorded when the men did
not benefit was a settlement made
without the participation of federal
mediators.
Washington. Aug. 26.—The crisis
in the railroad strike situation is ex
pected late today or tonight, when
the counter proposal Involving ar
bitration prepared by the railroad
presidents for final submission to
President Wilson.
On the acceptability of this pro
posal by the railroad brotherhood's
committee of 640 depended largely
whether the president's personal ef
forts to mediate shall fail.
The brotherhood leaders had re
ceived no official advices regarding
the railroad presidents' propositions,
when the regular daily meeting of
the employes' committee convened.
The workmen's committee planned
to remain in continual session until
they heard from Wilson.
The four brotherhood heads went
into secret session to consider the un
official report of railroads' position
which they obtained from newspa
pers- Opinion was divided ambng the
employes as to how the railroad's
proposal will be received. None of
them thought it would be accepted
without qualification, and a large
number of them declared that if the
railroads continued to Insist upon ar
bitration a strike inevitably will fol
