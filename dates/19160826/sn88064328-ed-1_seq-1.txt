'In the matter of the steps to

designated a State Approved
High School, the Secretary read
the following letter from the
State Superintendent of Educa
tion:
tion:
Department of Education.
Baton Rouge, La., Aug. 21/16.
Supt. L. A. Walet, New Iberia,
La.:
(Dear Mr. Walet— Un the matter
of the Loreauville School, I sug
gest that it will be best for you
not to attempt to organize that
school as an approved high school
next session, but that you take
I one year in which to prepare for
State approval. I understand
that vou have been employing a
number of teachers there who
while they are thoroughly com
petent and give satisfactory
service do not meet the high
school requirements. The plan
suggested above would enable
you to operate the school next
year without doing too great vio
lence to the arrangement that has
prevailed heretofore and at the
same time would put you in ex
cellent position to organize as a
State approved, high school for
the session of 1917-18.
The plan that I have in mind
is about as follows: Employ
members of the old faculty to no
the work from the first grade
through the seventh and have the
high school grades, eighth
through the eleventh, taueht by
a principal and a first assistant
who meet in every way the high
school standards, that is, who are
credited with as many as thirty
six college hours, or better still,
who are college graduates. In
order that these two hieb school
teachers mav have -»he opportun
ity to organize the high school
work ^properly, suitable labora
tory equipment should be in
stalled, the work started in the
sciences, and the necessary high
school library installed.
I believe some such plan as
this will Drove more satisfactory
than for vou to attempt to or
ranize the school a" a high school
at once.

On motion oj.' Mr. Walet, sec
onded by Mr. Landry, and car
ried. the Parish Superintendent
was authorized and instructed to
out the suggestions made
j the State Superintendent of
I Education concerning the fitting
..t <i,.. r i i ut.
up of the Loreauville School with
necessary equipment, and the ap
pointment of teachers for the s ii l
school for the coming session, to
the end that the said school may
be designated a State Approved
Ilish School as soon as it meets
the requirements of the State De
nartment of Education.
Mr. N. J. fDerouen, a patron of
the Marcel School, appeared be
for the Board and asked that the
said Marcel School be allowed an
assistant teacher, the said school
having had an enrollment of
ninety-two pupils during the past
session, with only one teacher in
charge.
On motion of Mr. Landry, sec
onded by Mr. Moresi, and carried,
the Superintendent was author
ized to appoint an assistant teach
er for the Marcel School, and to
make the necessarv provisions
for the accommodation of two
teachers in the said school.
There being no further busi
ness, the Board adjourned.

Just the Thing for Diarrhoea.
"About two year* ago T had a severe
attack of diarrhoea which lasted over a
week," writes W. C. Jones, Buford, N. D.
"I became so weak that I could not stand
upright. A druggist recommended
Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera and Diarr
hoea Remedy. The first dose relieved
me and withi B two days I was at well
aa ever." Many druggists ireqommend
this remedy because they know that it
ia reliable. Obtainable everywhere.

TRADITIONS LOST IN WAR.
Wars work the most surprising
results, and the present war is no
exception, and has resulted in
two notable conditions; one in
England, the other in Russia.
The daughter of the well-to-do
class in England has from time
immemorial been hedged about
with all manner of restrictions.
She has known nothing of the
freedom of opportunity which the
American girl in the same social
level has enjoyed as a matter of
fact. The demand for men for
enlistment in England has nat
urally been a heavy drain on all
kinds of work which had hitherto
been performed almost exclusive
ly by men. This created vacan
cies in occupations which were
possible to be filled by women.
And so today in London one
finds, as conductors on the thou
sands of motor busses, young
women, suitably dressed for the
work, filling the places made
vacant by men who have gone
to the front. The passenger ele
vators in most of the cities are

sands ot motor taxiea<>s through
out. the country are driven by
young women, (iirls from fam
ilies of wealth and refinement
have left their schools, corre
sponding to our Wellesley and
. Vassar, to return home and take
positions as stenographers and
clerks, who never before iit all
their lives had even seen a. type
writing machine. In cases where
the salary they earn is not need
ed, they donate the entire amount
each month to some one of the
funds for the relief of wounded
soldiers or their families. The&e
girls cannot go to the front, but
they make it possible for some
young man to do so.
an girl this seems
no more than the logical, obvious
thing to do, and only those who
kno^.from personal observation
of the severe social restrictions in
England will realize what a start
ling departure from what was the
"correct thing" all this really is.
The probability and from, an
American viewpoint, the hope—is
that when peace is restored, out
of it all will come a greatly rtt-"
larged life for English women.
Indeed, it seems hardly possible
that there can ever be an entire
restoration to the old order of
affairs.
The other startling condition
was the ukase which with one mo
tion converted a vod<ka-sodden
from a Russian peasant was like
taking beer from a German, al
though the former drink was cast
ly more injurious. The results of
this involuntary temperance arei
reported as most interesting, one
of which is a sudden and tremend
ous increase in savings-banks de
posits and accounts, and greatly
increased efficiency in the masses.
It is pleasing and heartening to
have these two pictures, one of
patriotism and the other of the
better life, to hold up in contrast
to the horrible and revolting as
pects of the great conflict.— II. II.
