. Washington, Aug. 25", Objections
to the' plan for the settlement of' the
threatened strike again delayed final
a'ction-on the matter yesterday. Tho
plan, which includes granting of the
eight-hour day "basis" in return for
the promise of the Administration
that all aid would be given in. secur
ing of higher freight rates, was evolv
ed by the subcommittee, of eight
after frequent conferences with the
President. Two objections were
that the granting of higher; freight
rates hinged on the unknown stand
of the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion, and that due to the short time
before the election, when the Admin
istration might change, the policy of
aid for the railroads might not be
followed in the naxt four years.

ting them seats in the conveyances.
: President S. L. Cowherd is work
ing especially hard on the parade.
He is anxious that all the business
men give their conveyances to carry
the crowd out. Anything to ride in. It
will be just as much appreciated if a

body on the handlebars of his bicycle
as if the biggest merchant in town
oilers a fine car.
