BOTH LOCKED ON ARBITRATION

roads Managers Insist Upon
Its Retention. j
Washington, Aug. 26. After the
heads of the four great railroad broth
erhoods threatening a nation-wide
strike had gono to the White House
yesterday, with a warning that their
men would not wait longer than to
night for a reply from the railroad ex
ecutives to President Wilson's sugges
tion that an eight-hour day bo grant
ed, the executives last night agreed
upon a counter proposal to be sub
mitted to the president today. This
plan holding to the demand for arbi
tration, which the employes have de
clared they unalterably oppose, pro
poses: That an eight-hour day is not direct
ly connected with the matter-at issue
and that there is a difference between
an actual eight-hour day and an eight
hour day as a basis for pay.
That questions of increases of wag
es are indisputably questions which
ehould be settled by arbitration.
That the present demands of the
trainmen be submitted to arbitration
by the interstate commerce commis
sion or Borne board to be created by
the president.
That if the arbitration finds wage
Increases should be granted, their
...ill lw 'i! ,'i iiii'i ivi" tinH the in.
crease will take effect from the time
tlw arbitration begins.
That a fund shall be created by the
railroads to provide tor this contin
gency, the interstate commerce com
mission to keep the accounts that will
bp necessary, and the arrangement to
continue in force for a time not yet
determined upon, the men agreeing
that during the period of arbitration
there shall be no further demands nor
any attempt to strike.
A draft of this report was submitted
last night by the cominitteo of eight
presidents who have been constantly
at work upon Its various phases for a
week. There was some discussion but
only one vote was taken and by it the
60 presidents and the managers ap
proved the draft. Sorce slight addl
tions to the phraseology are to be
made and the final draft presented
at another meeting tils morning
From that meeting the ?eport Is ex
pected to be taken to President Wil
son. It was said last nlgt this will
bo the final report of the executives
The railroad heads insls;, as they
have from the beginning of negotia
tions, that it is Increased pay and not
a shorter work day that the employes
really desire. To grant them the
shorter basic day at the preseut pay
It is contended, would mean ai addl
tlonal annual expenditure of $12,000,
oon.
Representatives of the men Indh it
cd last night that such a reply would
be unsatisfactory. It has been wll
known bImco the railroad presidents
went to Washington that many of
tin in would welcome a strike. Som
of them have pointed out that In their
opinion submission in the present
crisis would weaken discipline on
their lines, and that it would only be
a short time before the trainmen's de
mands are followed by similar ones
from other employes. Many of them
feel that a strike could last only a few
days at the longest ami the more Im
portant systems would have little
troublo handling the malls and milk
trains and supplying the larger Oltlei
with foodstuffs.

WILLIAMS TO OPEN AS USUAL
Precaution Urged Upon Students
In
Infected Districts.
Williams college authorities have
decided that there is no reason why
the college should not open September
as scheduled. It is felt, however,
that the assembling of so many stud
ents, many of whom come from infect
ed districts, might bring infantile
parlysis to Wllliainstown and so no
tice has been sent to all students re
questing those who come from infect
ed areas to spend two weeks away
from those places before going to
Williamstown. All students after
they arrive are cautioned to avoid all
risks, such as going to neighboring
towns where the disease exists, ami
all unnecessary travel until danger Is
past.

GREEK CITIES
Ancient Enemies Again at Each
Others' Throats
PROMISE BY GERMANY BROKEN
Bulgaria Claims Kavala, One City At
tacked, Should Have Been Her
Award of War With Turkey
London, Aug. 25. The Balkan situ
ation again looms large on the horizon
of the world war with the official an
nouncement In Paris that the Bulgar
ians have attacked rama and the
seaport of Kavala, both garrisoned
by Greek troops.
This announcement is confirmatory
of press dispatches from Greece dur
ing the last few days in which it was
stated that lighting was in progress
between the Greeks and Bulgarians.
The reported attack on Kavala threat
ens to make the situation between
Greece and the central powers acute.
BVei since the first Balkan war Sofia
has claimed that Kavala was one of
its rightful fruits 01 victory and its
concession to Greece has been the
source of much ill feeling.
Apparently, from the French state
ment, the allied troops do not plan
an advance on the right wing as Brit
ish cavalry detachments are reported
to have destroyed bridges over the
Angista river. On the left wing Paris
reports "appreciable" progress for the
Serbians and the capture of several
hundred prisoners. In the center
where the main effort of the allies is
expected, heavy artillery action is tak
ing place.
Fighting between Bulgarians and
Greeks principally at Seres has been
reported In dispatches lrom Greece
for several days. Yesterday's French
statement Is. however, the first ollki
at confirmation that the soldiers of
the two nations have clashed.
On August 21 It was announced in
Athens that the German and Bulgar
ian governments had given written as
surances to Greece that their troops
Would not enter Karats, Drama or
Seres.
The advance of the Bulgarians has
caused a profound sensation in
Greece, according to press dispatches
which stated that the advance had
been used by the Ycnizelist leaders as
a weapon to attack the government
and that volunteers were rushing to
the front to aid the commander at
Seres.
Kavala has been a bone of conten
tion between Bulgaria and Greece
since the first Balkan war. Bulgaria
claimed that the port should have fal
len to her for her victories over Tur
key.

FRENCH SOLDIERS MUST SHAVE
Order to Relieve Army of 120 Tons of
Hair.
Paris, Aug. 26. The beard of the
French soldier has been doomed In an
army order which directs that the
men at the front must shave all ex
cept mustaches. The order has been
the signal for the outburst of a hum
orous and ironic discussion in the
trench newspapers, to which some of
the most famous French artists, phji
osophers and literary men, have con
tributed. Gen. Pierre Cherfils. reasoning tech
nically, excuses the measure because
"the beard of a trooper weighs on an
average of sixty grames. With
:.iMMi,Mi,n men at the front this brings
the aggregate weight to 120 tons. It
was natural that tho staff should
think of relieving the army of this con
siderable and useless weight. It was
teasonable In creating heavy material
to make In compensation light infan
try."

encircling the left Hank and regaining
Erzerum thus nullifying all tiie suc

Armenia appeared to be well on its
way to a successful outcome, but the

Grand Duke Nicholas can continue his

The task of turning the left flank

the Mush group of the Turkish forces,
which reinforced by troops from every
part of European and Asiatic Turkey

Tho Turks appeared early in August'
to be in a fair way toward accomplish

The turning point came soon after

The battle continued uninterruptedly
until yesterday when the Turkish
forces, despite their reported super!-

Russian assault conducted from the

Both England and France.
"Infantile paralysis, the appearance

authority on the disease, "is a malady
as old as the world and which has
long been known in the form of
sK)radic epidemics affecting adults as
well as children.
"It exists now In England and
France. Thousands of persons were
affected by the disease In Sweden In
P.iO.", and Fram e suffered In Its turn

As to the treatment of the disease
Prof 1 Xcttcr adds:
"Beginning in 1010 we employed in

jects who had been previously af
fected with the disease and the results
were excellent wherever the subject

Rev.
P. L. Cow Sends Greetings
to
His Parishioners.
Dear Editor of Banner: I would like
to write personally to all the members
of my church and congregation and to
many other friends in Bennington, but
to do so would take too much of the
time granted me for a vacation by my
people, and as any communication in
The Banner will quite likely be read
by them, 1 am taking this method of
communication. No matter how many
other papers may be read, Benning-
toniaus of all creeds and political
views, read, The Banner.
e are spending our vacation at
tho farm home of Mr. and Mrs. (.'has
Deming. .Mrs Deming DC ing our
daughter. The farm was formerly
owned by people named Curtis and
often visited by Governor Seymour of
New York during his life. Mr. Dem
ing is a good farmer, keeps a dairy of
Guernseys and works both head and
hands. We are very pleasantly situated
keeling house in a part formerly oc
cupied by Mr. Deniing's father. The
place is quiet, though large numbers
of autos pass on the road near the
house. We miss the morning call of
the Court house clock, but have some
sort of substitute in the rooster, who
comes under our window at an early
hour, crowing at the top of his voice.
The farmers are all busy with late
haying, rain has been plentiful and la
bor scarce. Even 1 could have ob
tained work but lor two reasons, one
reason being my Queen would not let
me, and the other, I did not want to.
We have taken several rides and I
am compelled to acknowledge that
some remarks 1 had made concerning
Bennington roads need to be modilied
for 1 have experienced that they are
not the worst that can be found. How ever,
there are many delightful drives
with scenery that beggars descrlpi
tlon. 1 may be prejudiced for the
hills and mountains In this vicinity
are the first I ever saw, and they
still seem to me the most beautiful of
any yet seen.
Old Constitution hill is still In evi
dence and when seen at one angle
with its bald summit, save a lone tree
or two on top. fringed round about with
second growth, makes one think of a
bald headed man with a solitary hair
or two on his crown.
Greylock on the north is often call
ed Saddle Ball, because as seen from
the vicinity of Pantoosuc lake In its
relation to a mount, called Jones'
Nose, has the appearance of a saddle.
The lake referred to is near tho
place of my birth, and was attractive
to me in my boyhood, especially when
there were long rows of corn to hoe.
It has rather gained in appearance, for
there are now many cottages on its
banks and in near vicinity, together
with a boat house, club house, Y. M.
C, A. house and at this season of the
year, scores of young people disport
themselves In its waters or enjoy its
sports of boat and canoe.
While the physical features of the
town are about the same, great chang
es have taken place in the personel of
the people. Most of the folks I
knew In my boyhood are not here,
they have mostly passed on but others
have taken their places. 1 have call
ed on a tew of the old friends, among
them one of my school teachers, nnd
others who attended school during the
winters 1 tnught.
There are five places in town w here
preaching services are held. We at
tended two of them Sunday. I was
the only man at the afternoon service
except the minister, but the day was
warm and the pastor was away.
Quite a number of women were pre
sent. We have enjoyed our vacation thus
far and have tried to so spend it (hat
we shall be better prepared to lake up
our duties when we return next week.
One benefit of a vacation Is the glad
ness that results in going hack. We
weie pleaded to come, we shall be
ti.nl to return, ami nope to meet a
large number at the communion ser
vice Sunday morning. September 3.
In closing, would tender our lov
ing regards to all our people and
friends. "Our sympathy to the af
flicted, our good cheer to (he busy,
our best wishes to the young and
strung, and our congratulations to
those who are ripening for the har
vest '
Thanking you. Mr. Editor, for your
Kindness. I am

Forty-One Members Asked for Twice
That Amount on "Yea" and
"Nay" Vote.
Montpelier, Aug. 25. The special
session of the General Assembly
which convened yesterday morning in
response to a proclamation issued by
Gov. Charles W. Gates, calling atten
tion to the need of providing aid for
soldiers and their dependents, adjourn
ed today at noon. The only business
transacted today was the passing by
the lower branch of Senate bills 1 and
providing for soldiers voting at the
coming primaries and at tho state gen
eial elections, and the passing in can
currency of House bill No. 1, provid
ing for paying the members and fixing
the rate of mileage. The members
will receive 10 cents a mile.
Representative Chalmers of Rutland
contended cnat it was not fair to the
people for the members to go home
with 20 rents a mile mileage when the
actual cost was about six cents a
mile. Redfleld Proctor of Proctor led
the discussion on the mileage quest
ion by saying that except in one or
two cases 10-cent mileage would be
nearer fair than 20 cents.
Mr. Stone of Vergennes said that 20
cents a mile was all right when the
session lasted two or three months
and entailed several trips home.
Those voting "No" against the 10
c nt mileage were:

VERMONT
There's a state 1 love to dream of
Through (he winter's cold and
storm;
There's a state I love to visit
In the summer when it's warm.
Sunslntie's glory o'er Its landscape.
Breath lileglvlng In the air,
Rippling brooks and sweetest bird-
noto;,
Mower's son and flowers fair.
Groves of lefty sugar-maples
Whlsp'rlng to the summer brecio.
Wlntergreen among the bushes,
Maidenhair beneath the trees!
Oh. Vermont! I love thy hilltops.
Love thy forests green and cool.
Where (he white birch stands and
marvels
At her Image In the pool.
Many a charm. Hum slate resplendent.
Binds me closer still to lliee;
But nhove all charms thou boastcst
Are thy people dear to trie.
