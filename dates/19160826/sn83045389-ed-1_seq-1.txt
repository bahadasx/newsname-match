i:.\im:cti;ii iiv noiix to-ija^ I
The crisis in the situation Is ex- '
pected by noon to-morrow, when thr
President ha?j an encasement to ser
the brotherhood leaders
Rome of the executives said that
?while the proposal would not Rive them
more than 20 per cent increase in j
wages, provided for, in effect, in Presi- i
dent "Wilson's plan. It probably would
give an Increase of over 10 per cent.
The proposal, in Its tentative form,
covered th*ee typewritten pages. After
the vote several of the executives made
suggestions, which the committee of
eight probably will include in the final !
draft.
Throughout the discussion the execu- '
tives took the position that the ques- !
tion of the eight-hour day was entirely
one of wages, raihet than of princi
ple. They said to-night they never had
voted formally on President Wilson's I
plan as a whole, but that all of their
discussion had shown that it could not
be accepted In its entirety. The plan
now agreed on will be the first pre
sented by the executives since the ne
gotiations began.
Leaders of the brotherhoods could
not be reached to-night for discussion
of the railroad's proposals, but among
the men the sentiment was plainly
against the idea of arbitration. The
fact, however, that the railroads have
made an appeal was taken as an en
couraging sign that this might form the
basis for further negotiations One
of them said as a consequence be ex
pected the discussion to continue until
the middle of next week, or possibly
longer.
MAKE NO ATTEMPT
TO FOHECAST RECEPTION
Although the railroad presidents
would not attempt to forecast how
their eounterproposition would he re
ceived by the men, some of them were
inclined to believe the brotherhoods
would decide that much had been con
ceded, and that It would be n losing
fight to hold out for their original de
mands.
Statements were Issued to-night by
President Howard ISlilott, of the New
Haven, and It. II. Alshton, of the Chi
cago nnd Northwestern, President
Alshton said that in 1900 the amount
of wages paid train employees for each

Answerine one of Mr Gardner s que*,
tioris. which alleged that twelve of the
twenty.on- battleships in the fleet re- I
corded unsatisfactory results in the
.14 target practice, the secretary pro- I
duced a letter front Captain V p
director of punnerv exercises
Who said of his twenty years experi-i
ence in the navy: "| know ?f no time
during that period when the enemies
of our country had more to fe.-,r from
the batteries ..f our fleet than thev i
have to-day.'*
' 'aptain 1'lunkett added that by direc- 1
tion of the secretary, the widest pos
sible publicity would be given to the
trifle practice next month.
"I do not sympathize with this form
of criticism." the jfunncr director
wrote, referring to Mr Gardner's ques
tion. "and believe thnt it will under
mine the confidence of the people jR
the fleet and the confidence of the fleet
people in th? ;r ships and in the officers
who are .harped with the responsi
bility for the preparation ..f the fleet
for war"
* tfio??r <if Cftncr' ss," \fr
Daniels . ontinued. "Mr Gardner said
he wished he could have the ?.pinion ,.f
the oftiridi observer on our battleships
as to t heir target* practice. I read him
his opinion. These are n?t my words. J
not those of any politician, nor any
civil appointee of a political party.)
they are uttered with full km.wledjie of
his responsibility by one of the highest
officers of the navy and an expert on
these subjects."
STATE>1EXT WITHOI T
SHADOW OF POl'.MJ.tTlOX
"Never before in the history of the :
fleet have such scores been made as J
last winter at Guanianamo. The long,
range battle practice was the distance
of the recent naval actions abroad
The score hv the American navy is
higher than made In any of these
battles. The fleet has hit the mark
better last year and this year than ever j
hrftirr. I
"1 do not claim credit for the shoot
ing. My part was, in seeing that the
Meyer system must be radically
changed, in putting the most competent
men in the navy in charge of it. and i
backinp them up to the limit. As long !
us criticism was leveled at my admin
istration of the navy I d,d not carei
to n. ike any answer, for I knew results
would l>e a complete repudiation, but !
when the criticisms reflect upon the j
efficiency of the fleet, when everybody
who knows anything about it knows I
what it has accomplished in hitting the ,
mark, my duty to the officers and men !
who have made this splendid record is j
to declare that these statements are
without the shadow of foundation.
"Quite as gratifying as the marked !
improvement is the wonderful enthu- j
slasni In officers and men. who are re- !
solved to make a better showing in the j
fall practices. This Congress has dealt
penerously with the navy. The navy :
Is every day becoming more fit, fully !
Justifying the confidence of the Ameri- J
can people In their reliance upon it."
AXOTflEIt QI'ESTIOX DEAI.S
WITH TVPE OK TORPEDOES j
Another rpjestion dealt with the type'
of torpedoes with which battleships j
were equipped, Mr. Gardner asserting
that those In use in 1914 had been de
clared obsolete. He asked if the secre
tary knew this when he issued his 191-1
report.
"We not only knew it, but were al
ready manufacturing long-range tor
pedoes to take their places," Mr.
Daniels said, adding that these facts
had also heen contained in his own
report, and that of the chief of ord
nance to which Mr. Gardner referred.
I am also able to inform him,'' ho
continued, "that since then all the
Dreadnoughts in commission have been
equipped with these new torpedoes."
The secretary refuted Mr. Gardner's
assertions that there had been undue
delay in the completion of navy ships
of various types now under construc
tion. Labor conditions made it difficult
to hasten this work, he said, but the
department was doing all in Its power
In this regard, and had plans for the
1917 ships ready before Congress had
passed the appropriation bill authoriz
ing their construction.

WASHINGTON', Aucuft 25.?The
congressional career of Representative
James Hay. . hairniiiu of the House
Military Affairs Committee, and the
? entrul figure in the bitter prepared
ness controversy. came to an en.i to
day. practically speaking.
The House this afternoon passed the
army appropriations bill witli the re
n Ised articles i.f war as approved by
the Senate and the President. Shortly
thereafter Mr. Hay left the House
chamber with the expectation of never
entering- it again as a member of Con
press. To-morrow he. will po to his
home at Madison. Va . where he will
rest a month before taklnc his seat
? >n the L'nited States Court of Claims
on October 2.
Mr. Hay s resignation as a member
of the House will take effect on Sep
tember 311 As Congress wiH adjourn
within the next ten days. Mr. Hay
does pot expect to return to Washing
ton for concessional duty. He has
closed ,jP a|| )us work in his com
mittee. and removed his personal ef
fects from his office t|le t'apitol
According to his friends. Mr. Hn>
will leave i.'ongrep.s a poor man. He
first came to Washington twenty years
ago. and. although he has never had
any opposition for renominntion with
in his own party, he has found that
politics is a business in which to
accumulate a competence for old age.
Mr Hay's colleagues declare that the
fact he quits Congress without a dollar
after twenty years' service is one of
the greatest compliments which can be
paid him.
Mr. Hay's experience is not unlike
that of many of his predecessors in ihe
Hoimt. Only a member of Congress
knows of the hundreds of demands
made upon them for contributions for
charitable and other objects in their
districts which cannot he refused. It
is said that Mr. Hay seldom turned
down a request to help a worthy object.
Mr. Hay was the central figure in the
bitter controversy which has raged in
Congress during the past eight months
over the question of strengthening the
army and the navy. He started out as
a strong opponent to the "better pre
paredness" legislative program, as
launched by the administration, but
when the tinal show-down came he
went over to the President and gave
his support to the administration.

WASHINGTON, August 25.?The tirst
? lash of the session between so-called
old-line Progressives and Republicans
occurred In the Senate to-day. Senator
Oalllnger, the minority leader, criti
cized progressive P. * publicans for tjiq
overthrow of former Speaker Cannon
and attacks on the late Senator Aid
rich. drawing a vigorous reply from
Senator Oronna.
Senator ti-llinger declared that cer
tain Republicans who hud sown seeds
of discontent over the Dingley tariff.
? hose former Speaker Cannon ns the
"Jonah" on whom to heap the burden
of blame, and that they predched the
false theory that the hitrh cost of liv
incr was due to the Oingley tariff.
Senator Cronna insisied that the
tariff had nothing to do with the over
throw of Cannon. and that he was at
tacked only to end an era of autocratic
domination of the House. He also hotly
denounced inferences that progressive
Republicans had at that time demon
strated free-trade tendencies, and
charaed that U'-puhlicans of the "Old
liuard" hid sought to subject the
farmers of the country to free trade
in agricultural products.

Republicans held the floor through
out the day's discussion. Senator (Jal- j
linger predicted a return of the coun
try to the protective-tariff policy, and |
assailed the Underwood tariff in un- I
reserved terms.
"The history of the ten months dur
ing which the Underwood act was
operative under normal conditions,"
said he. "is sufficient to Justify our
predictions, and to further put the
stamp of disapproval upon the law.
which, but for the war would have j
ruined most of the industries of the I
United States.
"The rccor ! is crt'iinly a terrible in
dictment against the Democratic party. |
and it does not require a great stretch
of ihe imagination to predict that never
again will such an industrial catastro
phe occur as was brought about by
this minority-elected administration.
Senator Met "umber sought through ex
pert statistics to show that, but for
the war in Kurope the business of the
United States would have been de
moralized.

ON 1 \srnANCK POLICIES j
The Democrats of the Finance Com- 1
mittee to-day agreed to strike from |
the bill the proposed stamp tax on in- |
surnnce policies, against which there j
has been a flood of protests. Senator
Overman introduced amendments to
provide that the proposed 5 per cent
tax on manufactures of materials en- i
tering into the making of munitions,]
and especially into gunpowder, should j
not apply to agricultural products. The j
amendment is designed especially to j
exempt cotton, which is used in the !

to-day's official announcement of the
continuation of heavy bombardment in
that sector. The Herman lines in the ?
vicinity of Lassigny and Rove are being
heavily shelled.
The Germans have attempted a new
hlow-at the French at the point of the
famous St. Mlhiel salt-nt. This salient^
juts far into the French line south
east of Verdun, and has been the
scene of some of the lilooiliest fighting
in France. The force of the German
blow carried ?them into the French
trenches, but. Paris says, they were
evicted immediately by a counterat
tack.

Apparently, from the French state

advance on the right wing, as British
