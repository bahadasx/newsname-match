This plan, holding to the demand for
url. itiation which the employes have

poses; "That the question of an eight-hour
day is not directly connected with the
mutter at Issue and that there Is a
difference between an actual eight
hour day and an eight-hour day as a
busis for pay;
"That the questions of increases of
wages are Indisputably questions
which should be settled by arbitra
tion; "That the present demands of the
trainmen be submitted to arbitration
by the interstate commerce commis
sion or some board to be created by
the president or in some other way;
"That if the arbitrating board finds
wage increases should be granted
their findings will be retroactive and
the increase will take effect from the
time the arbitration begins.
"Thut a fund shall be created by
the railroads to provide for this con
tingency, the Interstate commerce
commission to keep the accounts that
will he necessary, and the arrange
ment to continue In forre for a time
not yet determined upon, the men
agreeing that during the period of
arbitration there shall be no further
demands or any attempt to strike."
Draft the lb-port.
A draft of this report wns submit

pKsidents who have been constantly
at work upon Its various phases for a
week. There was some discussion, but

tions to the phraseology are to be
made and the final draft presented at
an ther meeting tomorrow morning.
Ftoin that meeting the report is ex
isted to be taken to President Wil
fcn. It was said tnni.;ht this will be
the final report of the executives.
"It puts the issue squarely up to the
nun," was the wtv one offi cr phrases
It.
The crisis in tli,- situation is expect

Senator Galllnger, dean of" the up

seen such utter disregard of the rules,
history and proprieties of the senate.
Mr. Kern was attracting all the at
tention and the orator none, by the
time Tom Kellar, the Democratic pair
clerk, hurriedly approached Mr. Kern
and recalled to tho Democratic leader
Where he was.
With a sheepish grin Mr. Kern
threw the cigar into a cuspidor.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 2.1. The
"red" enemy fleet w;is within strik
ing distance of Sandy Hook tonight,
its course having been sighted by the
"blue" defending forces in the naval
war game at 11 a. m. today. 120 miles
off Rarnegat Inlet. This information
reached the navy department in in
tercepted messages passing between
Ueur Admiral Helm on the "blue"
flagship Rhode Island and the ships
of his command.
The "red" wonts were heading
west, the message showed, and navy
officials said Admiral Helm undoubt
edly was straining everv resource to
locate the main "red" fleet under Ad.
mlral Mayo and the transport train
that is bringing a hypothetical army
of invasion. If the "blue" scouts were
successful in gathering positive in
foi matlon before darkness compli
cated their task, it was believed Ad
miral Helm would make a "night at
tack" upon the most vulnerable ele
ment of the "reds."
The position and course of the
"red" secuts indicate that Admiral
Mayo might be making a dash for
some landing point either near New
Vork or at Delaware bay. The fact
stood out sharply that despite the
long line of scouts thrown out by the
"blue" commander, the "red" fleet
has driven to within 120 miles of the
nation's most Important seaport with
out having been Intercepted.
Should the "red" fleet evade the
battleships of (he "bliie
squadrons.
however, Admiral Mayo still will have
an inner guard of submarines to con
tend with.
DID MILLIONAIRE
ADOPT OWN GIRLS?
Margaret Morrison Testi
fies in Bankruptcy Trial
of Eccentric Man.
SAW
PROCEEDINGS
Btirnstein Declares That
Defendant Is Peal Father
of Children.
CHICAGO, Aug 2.1. How Edward
w. Morrison, eccentric millionaire
whose estate is under Investigation
in Federal Judge Lindis' court,
adopted two girls of whose parentage
their supposed father accused him,
was told on the witness stand today
by one of the girls herself. The wit
ness was Margaret Hiirsteln Morrison.
16 years old. Jacob Ilurnstein had
testified that his wife on her death
bed had confessed the millionaire was
the father of her and her vounger
sisti r, Alice.
The courtroom was crowded when
the two girls were brought In. Mar
garet's testimony followed revelations
indicating 'that the aged millionaire
had paid thousands of dollars to an
organized gang of blackmailers; that
he had loaned money freely on "I.
o. l.'.'s' of Irresponsible persons and
had paid huge sums for questionable
amusement.
Margaret said she had been legally
adopted by the millionaire.
Judge Ijindis himself ouestioned
the girl. She said she had lived at
the Morrison home since May lit
116.
"Were you present at the adoption
proceedings?' Judgo Lundis asked.
"Yes."
Mother's Wish.
"What do you know about the
adoption ?"
"1 know it was my mother's wish."
"Did Mr. Morrison ever say any
thing to you about his property?"
"No," tho witness answered.
"Or about plans for your future "
''He said he would take us and give
its an education."
Margaret will be on the stand when
the caso Is resumed Tuesday. As
court adjourned today force was
necessary to hold mfk the crowd
which sought to get a close view of
the girls.
Morrison's estate was thrown into
bankruptcy proceedings after an as
signment of much of his property to
James A. Ward, an attorney. By
terms of the will of Morrison's father
much of the property would revert
to the city of Chicago In event Ed
ward MorrJson died without Issue. His
estate w.fct estimated to be worth
about $6,000,000. hut so far the only
tangible assets found were an apart
ment building worth about $100,000,
a collection of old coins and $1 In
cash.
During the hearing today a tele,
gram was delivered to Attorney Ward
from A. Kolar, Thornton hotel. Butte,
Mont., saying he had saved Morrison
from human vultures in 1906 and
was threatened with bodily harm.
Judge I-andis said he thought Kolar
was merely seeking publicity.

of this great nation at an extremely
critical time."
Mr, Hughes reiterat -d his declara
tion that lie favored the appointment

what he ought not to do."

Senator Owen's determination to
demand a vote on a motion to take

hangs over the senate, hut several In

make it, would be defeated. Senator
Smith of South Carolina intends to
seek another opportunity to pass the
immigration bill and he might get it
through If It could be done without
