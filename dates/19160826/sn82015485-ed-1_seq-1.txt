An 80-acre tract of Trego- eocgtty
land sold last year for JSOO- aad : this
year produced mora than 2,000 bushels
of wheat, worth -about. 92,500: It
happens that way 4n western 7 Kansas
-soatetimes: -'"r: - v ' v -
Another 80 acre - tract, adjoining
the former, was sold a few. years ago
for S2.000, since ' which it . has - not ,
produced enough to pay the Interest
on the investment in any one year. j
It bappeos that way In western Kan
sas sometimes. " -
How are we to explain the differ
ence in the two eases? That's easy.
Ir the first case the farmer planted
wheat in a "whet year" and got a
good crop. In the other the farmer
planted corn in the wheat years and
planted wheat in the corn years ni
failed to get either. We seldom -get
a good crop of both - wheat and ' corn
the same season.

No man is wise enough to make the
right guess every time, year "after
year, and aside from the ordinary
seasonal risks be must run the gaunt
let of the three "outs"; blow; out,
burn out and hail out. The old adage
about patting all your eggs in one
basket applies pretty well in this
connection. :

GOVERNOR CAPPER'S FINE "SHOW
ING AS A VOTE GETTER.
The official returns from the recent
Kansas primary show that Governor
Cappper has broken all records as a
vote-getter. Notwithstanding the
total number of voters participating
in the primary this year -was about
7,000 less than tw years ago. Gover
nor Capper received 139,918 votes this
year against 105,800 in 1914. There
was a noticeable falling off in the
Demociatic vote for governor this
year. Hodges had 72,736 votes in the
primary of 1914, while the combined
vote of both Landson and Gaitskill
this year is only 47,432. Capper's
vote of 139.918 breaks all aecords. It
is the largest ever given any candi
date in a Kansas primary for any
office.
In many counties the governor's
primary vote this year is much
heavier than his vote at the election
of 1914, which is a compliment never
before accorded to a state candidate.
In Sedge wick county, for example,
Governor Capper's vote of 3,773 at the
election of 1914, was increased to 5,689
at the recent primary. Douglas in
creased from 2,664 to 3,703, and Wyan
dotte from 5,019 to 5,916.
Two years ago . Governor Capper
was high, man on: - the- Republican
ticket by 14,000. - This year he receiv
ed 22,000 more votes than, any one else
on his own ticket and had three
times as many as the combined Demo
cratic, Socialist and Prohibition vote,
all of which, indicates -that -Caaoer's
satisfactory handling of the office of
governor nas made mm stronger than
ever with the - neeole of Kansas.
fSosrooir Capper was elected two
jsaraT ago -by the record-breaking
majority or 50.000. His fine - showing
in Um primary Indicates that Charter
Finch may not have been - so- far off
when be predicted in the Lawrence
Gssstte the other day that Governor
Capper would be re-elcted by 100,000
majority.

this car and try it out for you. It is the speediest and most
powerful car for its size on the market. It is the most prac-'r

comparatively cheap. More miles to a gallon of gasoline
than any other car. You cannot appreciate the value of this
car unless you see it. Come in and look it over and if you
are not satisfied and convinced that it is the best value for
your money, don't buy it. Let us have your order early as
the factory is about 1,000 cars behind filling their orders
therefore it takes from 30 to 60 days to get these cars. K
