Those Unsigned Circulars.
Brief Review of Dirty Work Done by So-Calied Honest
Office-Seekers During the Recent Primary.
unlawful practlct
Tlic Kicker was a little surpris
ed the other day nt receiving
thru the mail some of the litera
ture used by certaiu Democrats
during the recent primary. This
"litcratoor" was sent in by a i
prominent Democrat ol the coun
ty who did not even request that
his name be withheld but 1 am
going to do it Just to keep the
patriots guessing.
But this Democrat is not of the
biown-in-the-bottie" machine
type, and there were some tiling
done iu the recent primary that
he wuuts the people to know.
None of "the party" organs
would dare tell the truth about
it, so this Democrat garbs him
elf in "sack cloth and ashes" and
writes to the Kicker, enclosing
"UteratOOr" and suggests that I
make such use of it us I see fit.
well, the most appropriate use
to make of such literature is to

While the Kicker took no part
in the primary, yet it ha many
readers who did. To begin with,
it must be understood that this

Kepublicans, as was the case in
DUO, when Matt Thomas defeat-
' obt. L. Harrison for represeuta-
live of Scott county.
This year they had no local So
cialist ' ticket to combat, hence
they started a little combat of
their own. In the good old days
the Democratic party was com
posed ol .luck Matthews. Dr. Ken

county,

couldn't hold office in Scott coun

times, however, a rupture occur

and a neat Utile scrap would fol

harmony," they placed men in
the court house jut as they plac
, I them in their banks, stores or
fields.
However, there was but one
way to get harmony, and that
v at to let the Sikeston group
have their way. Bikeston financ
ed the leading business enter
prises or the county and therefore
held the whip hand except at
Commerce. Commerce was. and
still is. financed by W. B, Ander
son of St. Louis.
Than, was one man on which
the different groups always

group' rebelled and tried to put
Charley Stone in the county
clerk's office. After a couple ol'
trials the Commerce group was
Whipped iato line and Mr. Mc
Pheeters was left undisturbed
until routed by a Republican two
years ago.
As before stated, during the
past eight years the interests
have had their hands full to -beat
the Socialists." During this time
Kelso township had grown until
it now has a larger vote than
Kiehland. The. two townships
combined have a larger vote than
the remainder of the county.
Dut there is not the necessary

B, Hugh Smith of Kelso town
ship was the man whom Plan ton
had to beat. A. 1). Walton, or
Chaffee was nlso a candidate.
This gave Kelso township two
candidates for prosecuting attor
ney and Kiehland but one. Hence
the vote of Kelso township was
split between Walton and smith
ami let Dlnntoii in b.v .
Now let us Investigate the
methods by which this victory"
.was accomplished, There is noth
ing quite so unmanly ana dis
honest as the unsigned circular
put out to appeal to the preju
dices or the voters on the morn
ing of an election. The fact
that the belated circular is un
signed proves that no responsible
person is willing to father It.
Yet voters are fooled b.v these at
every election.
Put the circulars that have
been furnished me by a lire-long
Democrat and circulated by Mr.
Blanton or his supporters, are the
limit. Not only are they decept
ive and unsigned, but special cir
culars were printed to appeal to
the prejudices oi different com
munities, Here is reproaucea ine
one calculated to appeal to the
local, or "home man" prejudices
of the voters or Sikeston:
PERSONAL I
It is a known Tact that the po
litical bosses in Penton and other
north end towns are strongly oi-
poslng nil candidates from sikes
ton and the Tact that on account
of lea lousy they do Hot want
Sikeston represented, They al
ways resort to this trick when
theV see their candidates doomed
to defeat. Sikeston has some
winners this time and every loyal
voter should stand by them. They
wont be ruled by county seat bos
ses either. They are working
hard against OL K candidates.
Show them today that we can be
as hard on theirs. (JIVE THE
p AIL BUYS a good vote today.
Little did the 145 voters of Kel
(0 township w ho voted Tor Plan
ton suspect that such a circular
was being circulated at Sikeston.
For them an entirely different
dose of do? was supplied. Hen
is a copy of the circular distrib
uted among the railroad men:
Has D. Hugh gmith ever denied
that he is opposed to the 8-tl0Ur
work day? Planum is for it. Vote
Tor Blanton."
The brain in which that circu
lar originated was anything but
clean. It makes no charge. It
asks a question that it does not
answer, Put the reader is exptct
ed to iurer that Mr. Smith was
accused of being against the
S-hour day. nnd that, when con
fronted, he refused to deny it.
The Blanton's have a newspa
per at Sikeston. I have never
heard of any -hour work day on
that. Put the most contemptible
circular of them all was circula
ted at New Hamburg, and every
voter aimroached by Planton
should demand an explanation
reads :
Vote for P. Hugh Smith.
(earless candidate. While he
siiiverintendent or schools
bravely prosecuted two defense
less sisters who were Instilling
knowledge in the minds and
hearts or children of the New
Hamburg school."
When Mr. Planton comes around
and oirers you that glad hand,
ask him to explain the meaning
or the above circular. It sot him
more than three votes to Smith's
one at New Hamburg. Ask him if
he approves or disapproves ol' the
efforts of Mr. Smith and the then
prosecuting attorney, Mr. Motley,
to stop the unlawful use or pub
lic school money in Keeping up
parochial schools-.' Don't forget
this and send me the answ er. Or,

circulars umong tile voters ol

Hamburg parocl.iul school to be

not the schools ol lieutou, uruu
and Kelso'.' Are not the Catho
lics of these parishes as much en
titled to public money as those ol
New Hamburg'.'
So far us 1 know, Mr, Smith
made a clean campaign. But tin
methods ol his opposition UilJChl
properly be classed as "practical
politics. Let Mr. Planton now
.plaiu this circular and say
what he would have done under
like circumstances, Would he
have enforced the law, or would
he have permitted the contin

money or priestly mi na nce.
While he was superintendent
of schools he bravely prosecuted

and nearts of childieu of the New

cula r.
How could Mr. gmith prosecute?
He was not the prosecuting at
torney. All he could dc was tu
call the attention ol the public
prosecutor to the law s violation
and if the public prosecutor be
lieved the law was being Violated,
it was his DC TV to prosecute.
L'ncler his oath he had no choice.
Why did not the author of tin
New Hamburg circular attack
Mr. Motley? Mr. Motley was the
mull who prosecuted the "de
It useless sisters," who were not
public school teachers and were
therefore not entitled to be paid
from the public school fund.
Everybody knows that neither
Mr. Smith or Mr. Motley are poli
tical friends of the Kicker.
Neither oi them are subscribers
or patrons in any way, U thej
lead it they borrow it. Put that
does not bar the Kicker from giv
ing the public the facts abo.it a
matter that no oth- r paper has
dared to mention. An 1 1 believe
that all law-abiding citizens will
agree that they did nothing more
nor less than their sworn duty.
However, 1 am satisfied thai
neither of them realised the size
ol' the hornet's nest they
ir.-ttiiu: into until alter
sh.ook the bush.
In conclusion 1 might suggest
that since the BlRtttonltCS put
out the unsigned circular above
quoted, the opposition might put
,,ut a signed circular and keep it
before the public until after Nov
ember, wtuch reads something
like this :
"Do you want a prosecuting
nttornev who ridicules a former
official for having enforced
law-.' If you do, vote fot

In the recent primary the old ma

And how did they do it? well,
it is this that I set out to tell
i r,n since a. prominent Demo
crat took the trouble to furnish
me with the evidence,
It is an age-old trick or the ma
chine to win by dividing the op
position. H the success of their
candidate is threatened, they

Fearing, however that no ex

the New Hamburg circular. Espe

New Hamburg to understand for
they are law-abiding citizens. It
refers to an incident that hnp
peued while Mr. Smith vvas super
intendent of schools and Mr. Moz
ley was prosecuting attorney.
Doth were new men in the politics
of the county and did not knov of
the probable arrangineut the old
politicians liad with the "Holy
Father" to exchange public school
money for political favors.
As superintendent of schools Mr.
Smith discovered that the teach
ers of the New Hamburg paro
chial school were being paid from
the pu)lie school money, and call
ed thf attention of the prosecut
ing attorney tO this brazen iola
tlon ol the law. Both being new
men, they supposed the law- on

to be Enforced on all alike. Hence

MAN'S DESTINY.
Py Victor Hugo
Stage by stage man must leave
behind him the false dreams o'
physical strife, the antagonism
of 'his fellows, the sharp pursuit
of his individual needs. He will
not leave sorrow, he will not
leave temptation. At every step
will appear new evils to be
conquered. This, Ins curse, is also
his blessine, for only in battle can
the soul or man be strengthened
Tor immortality For this Strug
pie ceaseless, eternal, glorious
the struggle upward, by means
or the perrect law of liberty, into
celestial light I believe that So
cialism will, in wonderful and un
foreseen measures, set free the
soul of man.
In the twentieth century, war
will be dead, the scaffold will be
dead, hatred will be dead, front
ier boundries will be dead, dog
mas w ill be dead ; man will live.
He will possess something higher
than all these, a great country,
the whole earth, and a great
hope, the whole heaven.
