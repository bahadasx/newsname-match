STAND PAT ON ARBITRATION
Rail Barons Demand That or
Invite Tie-Up.
Brotherhoods Probably Will
Take Action Today.
Washington. Aug. 26. The show
down in thte fight between the rail
roads and the railroad brotherhoods
seemed at hand this afternoon. The
question whether the country's indus
trial activity was to continue or to be
supplanted by complete stagnation
mav be determined before night.
For hours, in a room at the VVillard
hotel, the heads of the American rail
ways argued over the language in
which they should declare to the pres
ident their "final" stand. They worked
over and over thep aragraphs of a
proposal for settlement which they
had little reason to believe the broth
erhoods would accept, but which they
desired to be an unanswerable brief
of their side of the case.
At the White House the president
deferred meetins with the brother
hood representatives until this propo
sition of the executives had reached
him. The word went out that, re
gardless of the belief of the railroad
presidents in the finality of their own
action, thep resident was not prepared
to allow the negotiations to drop. He
will insist on continuing efforts to pre
vent the break, it was said.
Hote Badly Frayed, But
"If the proposal forecast by the rail
roads is made," an administration of
ficial close to the president said, 'the
situation is bad, but it is not final."
The president spent somo time today
vilh Secretary Lane who, because of
his long service or. the Interstate Com-l-ierce
commission has been one of
president's most important advisers in
the railroad controversy. Lane de
c.ined to discuss the matter when lie
left the white house. Senator New
ltnds, chairman of the senate inter
slate commerce committee who ear
her had advised the president that
. j.ction could not be takn by the
present congress on legislation desired
by the railrouds if they grant any
concessions to the men, alno called at
the white house. He left a written
communication but its contents were
kept secret.
The brotherhood G40 representa
tives held an hour's session, discussing
various phases of the issue and "kill-

of the brotherhood presidents ,how-t-ver,
would express such a belief.
Employes PelHite Arbitration.
The employes' session adjourned
shortly after noon until 2 o'clock. The
brotherhood heads had been closeted
in their hotel during the meeting,
waiting for word from the White
House which it was said would not be
forthcoming until the president had
received the proposal of the railroads.
The question of arbitration was care
fully considered in the men's session
but no action was taken.
Washington. Aug. 26. With dram
atic and sinister suddenness a crisis
came today in the negotiati ins to pre
vent the threatened railroad strike.
break between the railroad brother
hoods, representing 400, 00U men and
the railroad presidents, representing
tv.-elve billions of capital, seemed cer
tain. Sixty executives called here a
week ago by President Wilson have
ignored his peace proposal and decided

The roads in the proposal now

The proposition is less than four hun
dred words long. It is the first con
crete plan that has been voted on at
any time by the executives and met
with unanimous approval. It is the
oily proposal that will com? from the
roads, according to one of the leading
executives today and he added:
"It is better than the brotherhood
leaders deserve. If they don't like it,
Ihey know what they can do."
With this action unanimously agreed
upon at a conference last night, the
roads passed the question of a strike
or peace back to President Wilson and
the brotherhoods. Ratification of the
proposition was to be voted by the
executives and managers at 10 o'clock

Kaw Valley Products Could Be
Handled Cheaper Here.
FREIGHT TARIFFS DUE TO RISE
Costs Shippers More to Ship
Produce and Product.
All Depends on Decision of
Commerce Commission. .
Topeka, as the location of several
additional canned goods factories
which would handle the produce out
put of the Kaw Valley, is the fore
cast of business men and others In
event the coast to coast ' freight rate
hike, which means that Kansas jobbers
will pay approximately $81,000 a year
in increased rates on canned goods
from the Pacific coast, is upheld by
the Interstate Commerce commission.
Should these rates, the tariffs of which
were filed by the railroads, be upheld,
it is pointed out that an industrial field
pracDcally new wouia De iorcea to
spring up here, a3 under the new hike
the goods could be canned here much
cheaper than they could be obtained
from the coast.
Too Much Shipping.
Not a little produce is now shipped
from the Kaw valley to factories in
other cities for canning and then
shipped back again. . Under the rate
proposed, basing the statement on the
arguments of the shippers, that would
no longer be profitable.
The Kaw valley, it is asserted, could
now support. a reasonable canned
goods industry. Under a better de
veloped method in the produce indus
try among gardeners and farmers the
output would be greatly increased and
it would support several such fac
tories. The railroads are asking a rate hike
from Atlantic coast points to the Pa
cific coast, . including intermediate
points, and a hike, from the -Pacific
coast east. The increase they ask
means that Kansas jobbers must pay
$135 a car more for freight rates than
now, which would mean $81,000 an
nually in increase. The roads want
the rate raised from 62 hi cents to 85
cents in carload shipments.
Decision Soon.
The suspension board of the Inter
state Commerce commission complet
ed a hearing on the case this week. A
decision is expected soon. It is believ
ed by shippers the suspension board
will lift the rates for four months.
Should it not do so, Topeka jobbers
stand to lose $3,000 in increased rates
on goods which they have ordered and
sold under the old rates but which
have not yet been shipped, according
to E. H. Hogueland, commeffee coun
sel for the Topeka Traffic association.
Should the suspension board hold up
the rates it will probably be ten
months before the commission itself
acts on the increases as that body Is
given six months in addition to the
four months suspension to consider
the case.
Among others, J. Will Kelley, secre
tary of the Commercial club, is in
clined to believe the canning industry
of the Kaw valley will be boosted by
the increase if it is allowed.
FEAR OF HIS GUN
Wife Says Husband's Revolver
Is Under Pillow.
He Has Prophesied It'll Go Off
She Asks Divorce.
"He sleeps with a loaded revolver
under his pillow and says that some
time it will go off accidentally and
kill me."
That is one of the reasons given by
Nora Brown for a divorce from Wil
liam Brown, in a petition filed in the
district court today. She says she
fears the gun will go off accidentally
and fulfill his prophecy.
Mrs. Brown declares in her petition
that since 1908 Brown has been drunk
on an average of once a week. She
doesn't carry the matter out in totals
but a little multiplication discloses
that she charges her husband with
being drunk in the neighborhood of
400 times since 1808.
And each time he becomes intoxi
cated, she says, he strikes and beats
her one or more times. Those are the
major complaints of Mrs. Brown. She
adds that for five years he has failed
to support her, altho they have lived
together all but two weeks since they
were married, August 5, 1896. In
stead of supporting her, she says, he
has spent his money for liquor during
the last five years.
Mrs. Brown asks that the court
issue a restraining order prohibiting
Brown from coming around her home
at 1706 Topeka avenue, that it grant
her a divorce, permanent alimony and
the household goods.

"Enemy" Fleet Destroys U. S.
Defensive Squadron.
After All Day Battle, Army
Lands on Long Island.
Washington, Aug. 26. The defend
ing squadrons under Rear Admiral
Helm have been "destroyed" by the
hostile fleet under Admiral Mayo in
the navy war game and this afternoon
an invading army was being landed in
theory on the shores of Long Island.
Washington, Aug. 26. A great nav
al "battle" has been raging off New
York, harbor for six hours. The main
battle fleet of Admiral Helm defend
ing the coast engaged the attacking
i fleet of Admiral Mayo at 5 o'clock off
Scotland lightship at the entrance to
the New York harbor. Helms fleet
opened fire with 12-inch guns.
Eight war vessels two battleships,
one scout- cruiser and five destroyers
have already been "sunk." The de
fending fleet sunk the enemy battle
ship Texas and Nevada and the enemy
destroyers Wadsworth and Cooper.
Admiral Helm has so far "lost" the
scout cruiser Birmingham, and the
destroyers Draton, Fleming and
Balch. It is believed here the enemy
battleships were ''destroyed" early in
the fight by torpedoes from the des
troyers of the defending fleet.
After "Sunk," Return to Port.
Many other vessels have been con
structively lost but orders to the com
manders of the two fleets were that
shiDS regarded as sunk should oroceed
i to port immediately and their arrival
should not be reported. l ne battle
is being fought with every man of
each ship s company at his proper sta
tion but the firing is done with the
small caliber batteries employed in
training tuiret crews. They are one
nounder guns mounted upon the
twelve and fourteen inch weapons of
the main batteries so arranged that
the sighting is done thru the use of
the mechanism of the big guns. Um
pires stationed on each ship judge the
firing conditions and determine when
the vessel has been put out of commis
sion by the fire of her opponents.
"Whatever the outcome," declared
Rear Admiral Benson, chief of naval
operations today, "it has been an ex
cellent maneuver The department is
well satisfied so far as its information
now goes with the way its plans have
worked out and with the handling of
the fleet."
Loss Something Awful.
The "red" transports with the in
vading army which Admiral Mayo,
commanding the hostile fleet, appar
ently was seeking to land in the vicin
ity of New York, was reported as ly
intr off Ambrose light near Sandy
Hook. Whether the ships could pro
ceed or would be compelled to flee
for safety depended on the outcome of
'.he fight. Few details of the battle
reached the navy department. Offi
cials assumed, however, that the in
vading battleships were destroyed by
torpedoes fired from the "blue" de
stroyers in an attack shortly after day
lipht .
Large losses among Rear Admiral
Helm's "blue" scouts were taken to in
dicate that one wing of his destroyers
at least, had found end attacked the
enemy after an all night chase.

Four Missouri Convicts Make
Daring Escape.
Cut Cell Lock, Dig Thru 6-Ft.
Concrete and Stone.
Jefferson City, Aug. 26. The most
daring escape in years from the state
penitentiary here became known to
day when prison officials learned that
four convicts, one of them serving a
life term for murder, sawed their way
out of their cells last night and dur
ing a severe thunder storm, scaled the
prison walls. Bloodhounds immedi
ately were put on the trail but be
cause heavy rain that fell thruout the
night little hope for their capture was
held out.
The convicts had obtained saws In
some manner unknown to the prison
authorities. All the cells in the tier
in which they were confined lock with
a sliding steel bar and this was cut.
They eluded the three night guards
and gained the outside of the cell
building. From there they entered a
long unused tunnel that connected
with the power plant. It had been
closed from the outside years ago but
the convicts dug thru six feet of con
crete and stone, thus reaching the
stockade. A ladder was found in the
tunnel and with the aid of this they
scaled the stockade walls.
The convicts are William Webber,
life term for murder, from Jasper
county, and Thomas Finnerary, Jack
son county; Thomas McCall, Jasper
county, and Harry Morris, Marion
county, each serving ten years' sen
tences for burglary.
Warden McClung has offered a re
ward of $100 each for their capture
He said he believed the escape had
been planned weeks In advance.

New York, Aug. 26. Patrick Cal

remaining of a fortune of $14,000,000

Increasing Number of Clerks
Necessitates Addition.
FILES BUILDING NEAR SHOPS
Fireproof Housing of Road's
Important Records.
New Force of Clerks to Take
Care of This Department.
Because of the road's tremendous
growth, demanding greater office fa
cilities, in the last few years, a build
ing program, one of the largest
mapped out here by a corporation in
several years, will be included for To
peka In the Santa Fe railroad's ap
propriation budget for 1917, it became
known todsy. The program will call
for the expenditure of from $100,000
of $125.000. and includes an addition of
two more stories on the new general
office building between Ninth and
Tenth on Jackson street, and the erec
tion of a concrete, fireproof files and
storage building la the shops district.
The addition to the general office
building, as planned, will cost ap
proximately $60,000. The present
building, which was started in 1909
and completed in 1911, cost more than
$260,000. With the new two-story
addition the Santa Fe'a building will
be one of the largest In the west and
by far the largest in Kansas.
Create New Department.
The erection of a files building In
the shops district means the creation
of a new department here employing a
large force of office men. That build
ing will be used as a storehouse for
all valuable records and papers, the
preservation of which is demanded by
rulings of the interstate commerce
commission. The majority of the rec
ords are now kept in the old general
office building and the old freight de
pot, the latter building being located
in the shops district. - ;
The addition of two stories to the
general office building will make it
twelve stories high, excluding base
ments and subbasements as was pro
vided tor in the original plana and
specifications which were drawn prior
to 1909.
In the last eight years the office
force of the Santa Fe has Increased 60
per cent. Prior to 1911, when the
new building was completed, the ma
jority of the two departments now
housed in the two buildings were lo
cated In the old office building.
Buildings Congested.
When the new building was com
pleted officials of the road believed it
would afford office space adequate for
years. The passing of a few years,
however, found the big building and
the little one just as congested as was
the latter in 1911. Not only can that
growth be regarded as an example of
the road's growing business and pros
perity, but it is regarded as a barome
ter of the prosperity of the west, as
it has been pointed out that a railroad
Is the pulse of the territory thru
which It operates. The Santa Fe led
all other western roads in gross and
net revenues In the fiscal year of 1915
16, ending last June 30.
Its office building program here
surpasses the programs of all other
western roads, excluding the Southern
Pacific, so far as has been announced.
The Southern Pacific has announced
plans to build a twenty-story general
office building on the Pacific coast.
It Is probable that a large number
of the departments in the old general
office building will be mved to the
new building when the additional
stories are completed.
Tear Down Old Building.
In fact, the addition will undoubt
edly pave the way for tearing down
the old office building and the erec
tion of a new modern one in its place.
But little doubt is expressed hero
that the program as will be included
in the budget for the next fiscal year
will be approved by the executives of
the road. When it is approved the
building of the 2-story addition and
the files building will probably begin
at the earliest date possible.

Came Home to Campaign and
Job Was Abolished.
.DIDN'T LIKE IT WELL ANYWAY
Truly It Paid $16,500 a Tear
But He Had Few Friends.
Marion Man Expected in To
peka for Party Council.
Henderson S. Martin of Marlon, vies
governor of the Philippine Islands, re
turned to Kansas for a vacation. Now
he ah sdeclded to stay. Reason? His
job has been abolished.
News in Topeka today was to the
effect that Martin would not return to
Manila. Since he left the Islands, con
gress has passed the Philippine Inde
pendence bill. The measure carries
with It a provision abolishing the $16.
500 a year job held by the well known
Kansas Democrat.
Martin's job was one of the best
political offices ever given a Kansan.
He went to Manila in 1913 under an
appointment by President Wilson. He
had previously served as chairman of
the public utilities commission under
Governor Hodges and In 1912 had di
rected the state and national campaign
in Kansas as chairman of the Demo
cratic state committee.
In June Martin left the islands ex
pecting to take a vacation and return
to Manila next winter. The pending
independence bill, however, held Mar
tin's job In the balance and he was as
sured In advance of his leaving that
ne might not tind It necessary to re
turn. So Martin brought his family to
Kansas and will move to Lawrence
where he will send his daughter to the
state university.
He Never Liked It.
The Kansas man was never in love
with his Manila -job. To be sure it
paid a fat salary. But Martin was
away from friends and a distance of
5.000 miles keeps one out of touchy
with things at home. "He was lone-'
some. Every letter he sent home con
tained a sigh and a heartache.
. During the 1915 legislature, Martin
returned to Kansatf for a little visit.
He spent a week around the big brass
rail, on the third floor of the state
house, between the house of repre
sentatives and the senate chamber
and he was as happy as a child with
a new toy.
"Lord, I wish I didn't have to go
back," Martin told a Topeka friend
when the day came for him to say
good-bye.
Anxious to Get Back.
For months Martin has been plan
ning his trip to Kansas during the
present campaign. He was fairly
aching to get back in the game. Now
his job is gone and Martin is free. He
is probably just as happy as a man
can be who has separated himself
from a big federal job, but knows he
is back among his own people for
keeps.
All of which opens a new line of
thought In the minds of Kansas Dem
ocrats. With news that Martin was
actually home to stay, a movement
was started in Topeka today again to
name Martin as state chairman. It
is not known whether Martin will ac
cept the place, altho he has expressed
a desire to take a hand in the cam
paign. Martin will probably come to To
peka for the party council. If he con
sent to direct the fight for the Demo
crats In the present campaign, it is
quite probable that his name will be
presented to the Democrat state com
mittee as a candidate for the state
chairmanship.
