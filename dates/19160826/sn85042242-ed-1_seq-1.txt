Plans of Allied Troops for Ad­

Frustrated.
LONDON IS AGAIN
RAIDED BY ZEPPELINS
Berlin Confirms Report That In­
activity Follows Gains on
Western Front.
London, Aug. 25.—The positions of
the various forces participating in the
great European war remain practical­
ly unchanged, although slight ad­
vances are reported ror some forces
on the battle fronts.
Apparently, from the French state­
ment, the Allied troops do not plan an
advance on the right wing, as the
British cavalry detachments are re­
ported to have destroyed bridges over
the Angisla river. On the left bank,
Paris reports "appreciable" progress
for the Serbians, and the capture of
several hundred prisoners. In the
center, where the main effort of the
Allies is expected, heavy artillery ac­
tion is taking place, but there is no
report of infantry operations.
The lull on the eastern front con­
tinues, but the success of Grand Duke
Nicholas in Armenia is growing In ex­

gion of Lake Van is described in Pet

Turks and military critics predict the
resumption of *the Grand Duke's ad­
vancer toward Asia Minor.
Inactivity Reports Confirmed.
That unusual period of comparative
inactivity has followed the western
frpnt. gains, reported by Paris and
London, is partially confirmed by Ber­
lin. The Germans have, however, at­
tempted a new blow at the French at
the point, of the famous St. Mihiel sal­
ient. The salient juts far into the
French line southeast of Verdun, and
has been the scene of some of the
bloodiest fighting in France. The
force of the German blow carried
them into French trenches, but Paris
says they were evicted immediately
by counter attacks.

Expected Admiral Helm Will
Make a "Night Attack"
Against "Blues."
Washington, Aug. 25.—The "Red"
enemy fleet was within striking dis­
tance of .Sandy Hook tonight, its
scouts having been sighted by the
"Blue" defending forces in the naval
war game at 11:00 a. m. today, 120
miles off

Inlet. This infor­
mation reached the navy department
in intercepted messages passing be
tween Rear Admiral Helm and the
"Blue" flagship, Rhode Island, and
the ships of his comman.
The "Red" scouts were headed west
the messages showed, and the navy
officials said Admiral Helm undoubt­
edly was straining every resource to
locate the main "Red" fleet under
Admiral Mayo, and the transport
train that is bringing a hypothetical
army of invasion. If tho "Blue"
scouts were successful in gathering
positive information before darkness
complicated their task, it was believ­
ed Admiral Helm would make a
"night attack" upon the most vulner­
able element of the '®ed."
The position and course of the
"Red" scouts indicates that Admiral
Mayo might be taking a dash for
some landing point either near New
York or a Delaware bay.
Not compulsory arbitration, but
compulsory publicity, has bro.iKht
this about in Canada.
The general public is the third par­
ty in Canadian industrial disputes, but
there it has the part of a judge in­
stead of the innocent bystander.
Under the dominion's "compulsory
investigation" law, a railroad men's
organization such as the four great
brotherhoods would be required to
give 30 days' notice to the government
of they intended to strike.
The dominion minister of labor
then would call upon the men and the
railroads to appoint each one commis­
sioner, these two to select a third
commissioner to investigate every
phase of the dispute and lay the facts
officially before the public.
If the two commissioners couldn't
agree on the third, the minister of lab­
or himself would appoint the third.
Then, pending this commission's re­
port, the men would remain at work
and the railroads would continue op­
erating.
Every question bearing on the sit­
uation would be investigated by the
commision of three, and the facts to­
gether with the commission's conclu­
sions as to the justice of the men's
stand, would be laid before the pub­
lic also the commission's recommen­
dations for settling the controversy.
So successful is this method that in
61 railroad disputes since the law was

JOINT RESOLUTION. TO BE

London again has been the target1
for a Zeppelin raid, and as usual, the
accounts issued by Berlin and London
conflict. Berlin claims that the Brit­
ish capital was heavily bombarded by
several naval dirigibles and that bat­
teries and vessels were struck. Ac­
cording. to London, only one of the at­
tacking Zeppelins reached the out­
skirts of the village and only slight
damage was done. Eight persons
were killed and 30 injured, according
to the British version.
SUBMITTED NEXT WEEK
Washington, Aug. 25.—Congress is
getting ready to adjourn next Friday,
if possible, ignoring all threats of1
members to press special bills for con­
sideration over protests of administra­
tion leaders.
It is expected that a joint resolution
to provide for adjournment Friday
evening will be submitted to both
houses next week, as soon as the gen­
eral deficiency appropriation bill has
passed the house, probably on Tues­
day. Democratic leaders declare the
resolution will be adopted and that
this will operate to check a threaten­
ed prolonged fight in the senate over
the Owens corrupt practices bill,
which aroused a fusilade of charges
and counter charges of political cor­
ruption yesterday.
Senator Owens' determination to de­
mand a vote on a motion to take up
the corrupt practices bill still hangs
over the senate, but several influen­
tial Democrats said today his motion,
if he go£ an opportunity to make it.
would be defeated. Senator Smith, of
South Carolina, intends to seek an­
other opportunity to pass the immi­
gration bill and he might get it
through, if it could be done without
provoking debate. After the deficien­
cy and revenue bills ara passed, how­
ever, senate leaders on both sides say
"wild horses could not hold a quor­
um."

MEN BECOMING OVER
passed in 1907, there has been only
one strike!
This was on the Grand Trunk in
lGlO it lasted two weeks, and was
settled on almost exactly the terms
the commission had recommended.
That's what public sentiment does,
in Canada.
How differently it is done in this
country.
Here, the railroads buy page ads in
newspapers to state their side of the
case the railroad men, get their side
of the case told, the public mind is
befuddled by opposing contentions un­
til nobody knows exactly where jus­
tice does reside.
And the public always loses!
Canada's labor law resulted from a
letter written in 1906 by a Scotch far­
mer in Saskatchewan to Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, premier. Coal strikes had
made northwestern Canada fuel-less
this farmer wrote to protest, saying
it was the government's duty to pre­
vent coal famines.
Laurier acted. Rodolphe Lemieux
w^s then postmaster-general, and lab­
or matters were under his depart­
ment. The "compulsory investiga­
tion" bill became a law in March.
1907.
As originally written it was largely
the work of W. L. Mackenzie King, de­
puty labor minister, afterward em­
ployed by John D. Rockefeller. Labor
afterward obtained amendments, one
of them providing that when a con­
cern intends to fight its men's appli­
cation for higher wages it must so
notify them immediately, so that ar­
rangements can be made for the fed­
eral commission.
There used to be street-car and ves­
sel strikes every year in Canada now
there are none.
Spark From Engine Causes Dis­

PROPERTY DAMAGE
AMOUNTS TO $25,000
Charles City, la., Aug. 25.—Two
men and one woman were fatally
burned nine others, including a boy
and two women, were seriously burn­
ed and a number of others were less
seriously injured late today, when a
large oil tank, belonging to the Stand­
ard Oil company, exploded. A great
pillar of fire shot into the air for a
hundred feet, following the explosion,
and burning oil was scattered in all
directions.
A spark from an engine, which was
pumping gasoline into storage tanks
of the plant, caused the explosion, and
the fire, which followed it, spread
rapidly destroying the new plant and
causing a loss estimated by officials
of tHe company at $25,000. Pedes­
trians in the vicinity of the plant
were the sufferers from the burning
oil for the most part, and a panic was
caused in the neighborhood, the resi­
dents fleeing to get away from the vi­
cinity of the plant.

Millionaire Accused of Being the
Real Father of Girls He
Adopted.
ESTATE UNDER
INVESTIGATION
Margaret Morrison, One of Girls
Involved, on the Witness
Stand.
Chicago, Aug. 2 ^—-How Edward W.
Morrison, eccentric millipnaire, whose
estate is under investigation in Fed­
eral Judge Landis' court, adopted two
girls of whose parentage their sup­
posed father accused him, was told on
the witness stand today by one of the
girls herself.
The witness was Margaret Burn
stein Morrison, 16 years old. Jacob
Burnstein had testified that his wife,
on her death bed, had confessed the
millionaire was the father of Margar­
et and her younger sister, Alice. Mar­
garet's testimony followed revelations
indicating the millionaire had paid
thousands of dollars to an organiza­
tion of black mailers, that he had
loaded money freely on
"I.
O. U.'s" of
irresponsible persons and had paid
huge sums for questionable amuse­
ments.
Margaret said she had been adopt­
ed legally. She said she had lived at
the Morrison home since May 19, 1916.
'Were you present at the adoption
procedings?" Judge 'Lai-iits asked.
"Yes."
ti'6np£Vk*10^OU ^4^
"I know it was my mother's wish."
"Did Mr. Morrison ever say any­
thing to you about his property?"
'No," the witness answered.
"Or about plans for your future?"
"He said he would take us and give
us an education."
Margaret will resume the stand
when the case is reopened Tuesday.
As court adjourned today the com­
bined forces of the court's bailiffs and
a number of guards were required to
hold back the crowds which sought to
get a close view of the girl.
Morrison's estate was thrown into
'bankruptcy proceedings after a sale
of much of his property to J. R. Ward,
an attorney. By terms of the will of
Morrison's father, much of the prop­
erty would revert to the city in the
event he died without children.

Macon, Ga„ Aug. 25.—Captain Ed­
gar J. Spratling, of company, Fifth
regiment national guard, of Georgia,
was shot and killed in liis tent at the
state mobilization camp here today
by Mrs. H. C. Adams, of Atlanta. At
the county jail tonight, where she
was held on a charge of murder, Mrs.
Adams asserted that Captain Sprat­
ling, who was a physician, had offend­
ed her by attentions paid her several
weeks ago while she was in her office
in Atlanta for treatment.
Mrs. Adams, a woman about 30
years of age, came from her home in
Atlanta today, and went directly to
the camp. At Captain Spratling's tent
she asked the officer if her were Cap­
tain Spratling, and on being answer­
ed in the affirmative, fired at him
twice from a small calibre revolver,
both shots taking effect.
According to Sargent Kaysor, of
company, who seized her a moment
later, she cried out as she shot at the
officer, "You have ruined my home."
After the shooting she seemed hys­
terical. She said afterwards she had
never before seen Captain Spratling
in his uniform, but that he had treat­

Washington, Aug. 25.—Secretary
Lansing will attend the first meeting
of the American-Alexican commission
to adjust border difficulties, whicjj

Lansing has not decided whether to
issue formal instructions to the Amer­
ican commissioners.
The meeting in New York will be
only a preliminary to the efforts to
find a solution for the various prob­
lems arising out of border conditions.
Plans will be drawn up then for the
procedure of the commisisoners in the
first stases of their work and after­
wards they will be taken on a naval
vessel to the New England seaport se­
lected for their deliberation. The

COUNTER PROPOSAL TO
RE SUBMITTED TODAY
Rail Heads Still Insist on Arbitration of
Issues at Stake in Threatened Nation­
wide Strike of 400,000 Railroad Em
ployes.
Washington, Atif,'. 25.—After the heads of the four great rail­
road brotherhoods, threatening a nation-wide strike, had gone to
the White House today with a warning that their men would not
wait longer than tomorrow night for a reply from the railroad
executives to President Wilson's suggestion that an eight-hour day
be granted, the executives tonight agreed upon a counter proposal
to be submitted to the President tomorrow. This plan, holding tha
plan for arbitration, which the employers had declared they un­
alterably opposed, proposes:
"The plan of an eight-hour day is not directly connectd with
the matter at issue, and that there is a difference between an actual
eight-hour day and eight-hour day as a basis for pay.
"That the questions of increase of wages are undisputably
questions which -should be settled by arbitration.
"That the present demands of the trainmen be submitted to
arbitration by the Interstate Commerce commission or some board'
to be created by the President or in some other way.
"That if the arbitration board finds that the wages should"be
granted, their finding will be retroactive and the increases will take
effect from the time the arbitration begins.
"That a fund shall be created by the railroads to provide for
this contingency, the Interstate Commerce commission to keep the
accounts that will be necessary and the arrangements to continue
in force for a time not yet determined upon, the men agreeing 1$uii
during the period of arbitration there 'shall be no further
or other attempt to strike."

Affiliation of Equity With
Live Stock Exchange.
PRESIDENT WILL DISCUSS
QUESTION IN MONTANA
St. Paul, Minn., Aug. 25.—Officials
of the Equity Co-operative Exchange
are receiving letters from farmer
members protesting against their
joining the Livestock Exchange in
South St. Paul. The farmers say
they cannot see why they should form
a co-operative company and then sell
their stock under the same rules and
regulations imposed for many years.
They say they want an independent
selling agency.
President Anderson will leave this
evening for Great Falls, Mont., to
close contracts with 50 elevators that
will sell their grain through the Equi­
ty Exchange, and while there he will
talk over the livestock proposition
with the growers and get their opin­
ion.
There is a question whether the
Equity will be admitted to the South
St. Paul Exchange. The rules of the
Equity require a division of profits
with the shippers, while those of the
South St. Paul Exchange forbid any­
thing in the nature of rebates. The
Equity people have assurances, how­
ever, that they will be able to sell to
the packers. The greatest problem
will be to find a market for feeders
if they cannot be sold on the Ex­
change.

TO BE NAMED
St. Paul, Aug. 25.—Who will suc
ced Colonel W. P. Clough, as chair­
man of the board of directors of the
Northern Pacific railroad probably
will be decided soon, according to offi­
cials of the road.
J. M. Hannaford, president, went to
New York Wednesday to look after
matters in the department presided
over by Colonel Clongh, and it is prob­
able he will call a meeting of the di­
rectors to decide the question while
he is there.
Colonel Clough was a director of
the road and a member of the execu­

It is probable that the position of
chairman of the board will be abolish­

Issue Up to the Men.
"It puts the issue squarely up to
the men," was the way one official
phrased it.
The crisis in the situation is x
pected by noon tomorrow, when the
president has an engagement to set
the Brotherhood leaders.
Some of the executives said that
while the proposal would not give
more than 20 per cent increase in
wages provided for, in effect, in Pres­
ident Wilson's plan, it probably would
give an increase of o'ver 10 per cant.
The proposal in its tentative form
covered three typewritten pages. "Af­
ter* the vote, several of the exwuijtivft
made suggestions, which tjie Commit­
tee of eight probably will include in
the final draft.

Executives Take 'Stand.
Throughout the discussion the ex-'
ecutives took the position that the
question of an eight-hour day was
one of wages rather than one of prin­
ciple. They said tonight they never
had voted formally on President Wil­
son'? plan as a whole, but that all
of tiif-ir discussion had shown that
it rtniid not accepted in its en­
tirely. Tim plan now agreed on will
be the first presented by "the execu­
tives since the negotiations began.
Leaders of the brotherhoods could
not be reached tonight for discussion
of the railroad men's proposal, but
the sentiment was plainly' ar­
bitration. The fact, however, that
the railroads had made a proposal
was taken as an encouraging sign
that this might for the basis for fur­
ther negotiations. One of them said,
as a consequence, he expected the
discussion to continue until the mid­
dle of next week, or possibly longer.
Although the railroad presidents
would not attempt to forecast how
their counter proposition would be re­
ceived by the men, some of them www
inclined to believe the brotherhoods
would decide that iquch had been con­
ceded, and that it would he a losing
fight to hold out for their original de­
mands.
