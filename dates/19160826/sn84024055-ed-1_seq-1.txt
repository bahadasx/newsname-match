AT THAT TfeEB COL. LOWDEN WAS ONE OF THE DIEECTOES OE OR
CHESTRA HALL AND HE WAS NOT IN PAVOR OP PERMITTING
SENATOR TILLMAN TO PREACH ANARCHY, MOB AND LYNCH LAW
AND HIS SHOT GUN POLICY FOR LAW ABIDING COLORED MEN,
WOMEN AND CHILDREN FROM THE PLATFORM IN ORCHESTRA
HALL."
THE LATE ROBERT M MITCHELL, JAMES H. PORTER AND THE WRITER
TALKED WITH HTM OVER THE LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE AT
HIS HOME AT OREGON-, TLTi,, MONDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 26,
1906 AND HE EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO COME TO CHICAGO
AND CONSULT WITH THE OTHER DEFECTORS OF ORCHESTRA
HALL TO SEE IF THE CONTRACT COULD NOT BE SET ASIDE
WHICH HAD BEEN ENTERED INTO WITH THE PROMOTERS OF THE
TILLMAN LECTURE.
COL. LOWDEN BEING ONE OF THE HEAVY STOCKHOLDERS IN THE
PULLMAN PALACE CAR CO., IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT
EVERY COLORED MAN IN THE SERVICE OF THAT COMPANY LIV
ING IN THIS STATE WILL RALLY TO HIS SUPPORT AND ASSIST
TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE ON WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, FOR HIM
TO SECURE THE NOMINATION FOR GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS.
COL. FRANK 0. LOWDEN.
The true and tried friend of the Afro-American race who will open up Mi
fcoom in full blast for the Republican nomination for Governor of Illinois,
in Chicago, Saturday, August 26th and his able and far seeing campaign
manager, the Hon. W. H. Stead, declares that "everything indicates his
overwhelming nomination against all competitors for governor at the State
Wide primaries Wednesday, September 18th.
It will be recalled that for two weeks
prior to Tuesday evening, November
27th) 1906 that a most bitter and an
unrelenting warfare was waged through
the columns, of this paper against per
mitting Benjamin R. Tillman, the South
Carolina anarchist, from lecturing in
Orchestra Hall for the benefit of the
Union Hospital, that at the end of our
memorable fight on him he was driven
from the lecturing platform.
The following part of our long to be
remembered fight on him has never been
set forth in cold typo before, so eager
were we to prevent him from appearing
in Orchestra Hall, to exploit or to advo
cate mob and lyncTi law and his shot
gun policy when come down to dealing
with law abiding Colored men, women
and children, that we loft no stone un
turned in an effort to choke him off.
On Sunday morning, November 25th,
1906, we met the late Alexander Sulli
van in nis Jaw omces in the Atwoou
Building by an appointment made with
him on the Saturday evening before
and after spending many hours in con
sulting many law books in an effort to
see if there was not some law that
could be resorted to to prevent Senator
Tillman from making his grand stand
play against the Colored people at
Orchestra Hall, finally he said that
nothing could be done in that direction
unless we could prove in advance that
riot, bloodshed and human lives would
come to a sudden end and property
rights would be destroyed by his pres
ence at Orchestra Hall, of course we
were not in a position to prove that
Monday morning, November 26th, 1906,
we wended our way to the law offices
of Patrick H. O'Donnell and William
Dillon and they both imparted the same
information to us. That same Monday
evening while sitting in the law office
of the late Robert M. Mitchell, who was
one of our best and truest friends, dis
cussing the situation with him, Mr.
James H. Porter entered and declared
that the next best thing to do would
be to get Col. Frank O. Lowden on the
long distance phone at his home at
Oregon, HI., and see if he could not
help us out, it was no sooner said than
itr -was done and 'Mr. Porter' was the
first to talk to him over the long dist
ance wire and after fully explaining
the situation to him the writer took a
hand in talking to him, for be it re
membered t"hat at that time Col. Low
den was one of the directors of Orches
tra Hall, he strongly intimated to us
that ho was not in favor of permitting
Senator Tillman to preach "anarchy"
mob and lynch law and his shot gun
policy for law abiding Colored men,
women and children from the platform
in Orchestra Hall, but that there was
no law to prevent him from speaking
there unless we could prove before hand
that property rights would be destroyed,
riot and bloodshed would follow, and so
on from that day to this Col. Lowden
has stood mighty high in our estima
tion. Mr. Mitchell has passed to the
great beyond, likewise Mr. Sullivan, but
Mr. Porter who is not supporting Col.
Lowden in his race for the nomination
for governor can testify as to the truth
fulness of the above statement.
Col. Lowden being one of the heavy
stockholders in the Pullman Palace Car
Co., it is almost useless to state that
every Colored man in the service of
that company will rally to his support
on September 13, and greatly assist to
put him over the plate for the nomina
tion for coverjKjr of Illinois.
