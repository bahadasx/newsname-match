I WILSON HURRIES TO
CAPITOL ON STRIKE
By Associated Press
Washington, I). C., Aug. 26.—With
negotiations for averting the threat
ened railway strike practically at dead
lock, President Wilson to-day suddenly
went to the Capitol and conferred with
administration leaders over the possi
bility of legislation.
The President conferred first with
Democratic I.eader Kern and Chair
man New-lands, of the interstate com
merce committee, who, it was under
stood, after a canvass of the congres
sional situation, liad concluded it was
feasible to get through Congress be
fore adjournment as an amendment to
the pending bill to increase the mem
bership of the Interstate Commerce
Commission some sort of an expres
sion that the railways should be au
thorized to make rate increases to
meet higher wages and to provide
some sort of machinery for arbitration
for similar disputes in the future, pos
sibly along the lines of the Canadian
commission.
When he finished conferring with
Senators Kern and Xcwlands, Presi
dent Wilson came to the door of liis
room and said to inquirers:
"I came here on certain matters of
legislation. That is all I can say now."
Then after making the foregoing
announcement President Wilson re
turned to the White House without
conferring with anyone else and with
out making any further explanation
of his visit. Senator Xewlands stated
positively that no Joint session of Con
gress had been arranged.
Executives Adjourn
Late this afternoon the railroad ex
ecutives adjourned without having fin
ished their statement to President Wil
son and their attitude was announced
as unchanged.
Just before the President went to
the Capitol the brotherhood leaders,
impatient at teh delay of the railroad
executives in replying to the Presi
dent's last proposal, declared that only
the unqualified concession of the eight
hour day or some action by Congress
to cause the government to operate
the railroads could prevent the threat
ened strike.
On all hands the President's visit
to the capitol was taken as indicat
ing that the situation had reached a
crisis. Lte this afternoon the rail
way executives still were working on
their communication to President
Wilson.
Among the railway executives it
was said that any plan for legislation
suggested by the President would have
to be considered, but that the in
clination of the railway heads was to
Stand solidly on their demand for arbi
tration of the present dispute.
By Associated Press
Washington, D. C., Aug. 26.—The
threatened railway strike situation
took on added tensity to-day as the
railway executives continued their de
liberations over the form of their
counter proposal to President Wil
son's plan and the brotherhood lead
ers silently awaited the next move.
The executives have been told that
the men's leaders expect difflcultv in
rstraining them after to-night. The
presidents worked steadily all morning
and the fore part of the afternoon
carefully phrasing their statement to
President Wilson, but shortly after
noon had taken no final vote on it.
As had been outlined unofficially. It
declines to concede the eight-hour day
without arbitration and investigation
of its application to railroading, but
makes some concession as to collateral
Issues.
The the executives' counter
proposal will be to pass the issue back
