most vivid example of weakness, vacil

time and again charged. On the face of
it the two Important points involved
in the controversy were, viz: An eight
hour day and time-and-a-half for over
time for trainmen. Entering the con

notwithstanding many of the public
might think so, was not perse an ar
biter. The first day with a dash of:

Manager And Store Room to
Be Selected Tonight
Opening Sept. 11.
The directors and stockholders of
the newly oYganized Fairmont Co-op
erative store association will meet to
night at 7:30 in Willard Hall to finally
determine upon a manager for their,
new store and to complete details of
the arrangements for the store room.
The new store, which will likely be
opened about September 11, has now
}00 families who are represented in
the organization and hold shares of
the capital stock.
W. M. Rogers, one of the directors
of tile local association returned yes
terday from Grafton whore he inspect
ed the working of the Grafton co-op
erative store. This Grafton store has
been in operation for less than three
years and each year has paid the stock
holders a good dividend besides hav
ing used considerable of their prof
it for the purchase of the store build
ing, which tlicy occupy, which is now
valued at $15,000.
"The Grafton store," said Mr. Rog
ers, "employs Bix persons to attend
to the wants of the patrons and uses
two automobile trucks for the deliv
ery of their merchandise. All of the
Grafton association members are en
thusiastic supporters of the co-opera
tive plan which has been very suc
cessful in that city from the first day
the store was opened. I see no reason
why the Fairmont store cannot do as
well or even better."

Prominent McDowell Coun
ty Republicans Indicted
For Fraud.
WHEELING, Aug. 26.?Word was
received in the city last night from
Webster Springs to tho effect that
the federal grand jury returned in
dictments against General Edgard
O'Toole, of McDowell county, and nine
teen of his associates, all prominent
Republicans. General O'Toole is heud
of the U. S. Steel Corporation's coul
operations in this state and one of
the leading employers of labor in West
Virginia. He is a business man ot
tho highest standing and has taken
an active interest in public affairs
in the southern part of the state. Re
publicans generally are highly indig
nant over the indictments and terra
tho proceedings political persecution
for the purpose of discrediting the late
primary.
It Is a significant fact that two spe
cially employed Democratic attorneys
wt!ra,enipk)yed-4>y-the-department of
justice at Washington to aid in this
particular prosecution and assist in
bringing about these indictments.
General O'Toole could not be reach
ed last night but his friends stated
he courted investigation and promi
nent Republicans stated there was no
substantial ground for the indictments.
The specific charge against General
O'Toole is "conspiracy to bring about
the nomination of William F. Ilite for
tho United States Senate by .fraud."
Republicans point out that no trial
of the case can be had and none is
expected before the election and the
sole effect of the charges is to discred
it Mr. O'Toole and his associates and
give them no opportunity to answer.

KANSAS CITY, Aug. 26. ? Kansas
City house holders welcomed into theiL
homes today, great numbers of the un
ion veterans of tho Civil war here to
attend the annual encampment of the
Grand Army of the Republic. Between
15,000 and 20,000 vetorans have reach
ed the city and because capacity of ho
tels and boarding houses were taxed
and because many of the old soldiers
aro in moderate circumstances, the
citizens were asked by tho local com
mittee to take care of as many of the
visitors as they could. Besides the,
veterans quartered in private homes,
others were assigned in a large dance
hall fitted out with cots. Other tem
porary homes have been arranged.
Convention hall, the place for the
formal meetings of the veterans, has
been divided into booths In which scat
tered members of regiments may re
unite. One of tne booths has been
turned over to the pension bureau at
Washington, at request of E. C. Tie
man, acting commissioner, and in it
questions pertaining to pensions will
be answered.
A thousand boy scouts will act as
guides and aids to the veterans while
they are here. Under the direction of
Dr. James H. Sowerby, chief Bcout ex
ecutive, they have been trained to
serve the soldiers in every way. Spe
cial training in first aid work has been
given tty.e youngsters.
"Whenever you speak to a veteran,
call him 'comrade,'" said Dr. Sower
by in his final instructions. "They are
keen for helping the old men," Dr.
Sowerby said, "and I can imagine the
stories the veterans will tell them. It
will be good training for the boys ana
should be of great service to tho men

WASHINGTON, Aug. 26?President Wilson sudde
left the White House this afternoon with the intention

the threatened railroad strike. Officials refused t(y" "
his purpose.
Among brother officials it was learned that onra the

The trip to capitol was entirely unexpected and no ar
rangements had been made for his reception thereiil Al
though it was known the President came to discuss lefl
islation affecting the threatened srike, his specific pi
had been kept a secret.

tion affecting state railroads.
(By AHsoclatt.'d PresiO ,
WASHINGTON. Aug. 26?A crisis in
the negotiations looking to the avoid
ance of a nation wide railroad strike
appeared imminent today ^hen a coun-|
ter proposal involving arbitration was
prepared by the railroad presidents
for flnat submission to President Wil-l
son.
| On the acceptability of this proposal
by the railway brotherhoods commit-!
tee of 640 depends largely whether
j the President's personal efforts to me
diate shall fail. Heretofore the broth-]
erhood leaders' have stood firmly
| against any plan to arbitrate their de-|
I mands for an eight hour day atf a
basis in determining wages.
The railroad executives met early to
| day to perfect a draft of their propos
al and wore expected to send it irame-|
idiately to President Wilson who had
an engagement with the Brotherhood
leaders about noon.
This plan, holding to the demand
for arbitration which the employees
have declared they unalterably op
pose, proposes:
That this question of an eight-hour
day is not directly connected with the
matter at issue and that there is a dif
ference between an actual eight-hour
day and an eight-hour day as a basis
for pay;
That questions of increases of wages
are indisputably questions which
should be settled by arbitration;
I That the present demands of the
trainmen be submitted to arbitration
by the interstate commerce commis
sion or some beard to be created by
| the President or in some other way.
! That if the arbitrating board finds
wage increases should be granted, their I
finding will be retraitive and the in-1
crease will take effect from the time
the arbitration begins;
That a fund shall be created by the
railroads to provide for this contin
gency, the interstate commerce com
mission to keep the accounts that win
be necessary and the arrangement to
continue in force for a time not yet
determined upon, the men agreeing
that during the period of arbitration
thore shall be no further demands nor
any attempt to strike.
A draft of his report was submitted
last night by the committee of eight
presidents, who have been constantly
at work upon its various phases for a
wqek. There was some discussion, but
enly one vote "was taken and by it, the
sixty presidents and the managers ap
proved the draft.
The executives have been told that
the men's leaders expected difficulty
in restraining the news after tonight.
The Presidents worked all morning
and the fore part of the afternoon
carefully phrasing their statement to
President Wilson but shortly after
noon had taken no final vote on it.
The effect of the executes' counter
proposal will be to pass the issue back |
to the brotherhood and the outlook is i
variously d bribed by those In touch
with the negotiations. Some of the!
railroad executives say their proposi
tion is positively their las some of
the men's leaders stai d firmly against
arbitration. Others on both sides have
hopes that out of it will come further
i negotiations delaying the strike and
possibly averting it.
