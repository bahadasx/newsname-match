WAHHINGTON. Aug. 26. Tho de
fending squadrons under near Ad
miral Helm have been "destroyed"
by tho hostllo fleet undir Admiral
.Mayo In tho navy war game off New
York Harbor, and this afternoon an
invading army was being Landed
(theoretically) on the shoro of Long
Island. s -'
Tho following message from the
chief umpire was picked up by tho
Arlington wireless station at 11.10
to-day:
"Discontinued battleship engage
ment 11.10 A. M. Iled forco gain con
trol of sea. Cannot call problem yet."
Tho only hope of protection of the
Atlantic Coast from the Invading
army now lies In the defending sub
marines, which wero believed to hnvo
arrived In tho vicinity of tho landing
about 11.30 o'clock. Tho exact num
ber In tho flotilla Is unknown, as four
have reliably been reported "sunk"
and more rumored "destroyed." There
wero originally seventeen under com
mand of Admiral Grant. When last
heard from thoy were oft Fire Island
at 9 o'clock this morning, about 25
miles from tho sceno of the engage
ment. A great naval battle between the
"Itcd" Invading fleet and tho "Blue"
fleet, under command of Admiral
Helm, which Is defending the coast,
was In progress to-day out In the At
lantic along a lino extending, roughly
speaking, from Long Beach to Cape
May. Tho battlo began shortly before
daybreak this morning when four dc
troyers of the "Red" fleet made a
dash In from tho ocean and en
deavored to send men a shoro at Far
Kockaway.
The dostroyers were sighted by the
scout cruisers of the "Illuo" fleet and
driven off. Away out In tho Atlantlo
the battleships and cruisers of tho
invading fleet manoeuvred for an at
tack, whllo Admiral Holm, having
been apprised by wireless of the ap
proach of tho "Itcd" fleet, steamod
to the defense of Now York harbor
at top speed.
At noun wireless reports stated
that two battleships, the Texas and
Nevada, one scout cruiser and 11 vo
destroyers, Including the Wadsworth
and Cooper of tho "Ited" 'fleet, had
been "sunk" by Admiral Holm's de
fending forces.
In his movement against tho ap
proachlng fleet of Invasion Admiral
Helm up to noon had "lost" tho scout
cruiser Birmingham and tho destroy
crs Fanning, Druton and llalch. Naval
observers ashore say the three do.
stroyers or tne "iiiuo' ncet were
probably sunk In an attack on tho In
adlng battleships and that the battle
ships wore undoubtedly aont to tho
theoretical bottom of the sea by tor
pedoes launched from tho thrco do
it ro ye rs.
Admiral Mayo, commanding tho
"Hed" fleet which assembled early In
tho week nt n point somo 600 miles
out to sea, managed to got within
striking dlstnnco of Scotland Light
during tho night without being ob
served by tho scouts of tho defenders.
It was not until tho Kockaway land
lug was attempted that tho point of
attack was positively known to Ad

8-Hour Day Is Flatly Rejected in
"Last Word" of the Executives.
Ilrotbcrhood officials that only unqualified concession' by tho railroads of
tho eight-hour day or aetlon of .Congress taking over the railways tor
Government operation could prevent the threatened strike.
Wilson first conferred with
Oemoeratlo Leader Kern. Later
ha saw Chairman Newlands of the
Interstate Commerce Committee,
who, it was understood, after a
canvass of the Congressional .sit
uation, had concluded It wis feas
ible to ajst through Congress bo

Interstste Commerce Commission,
some' sort of an expression that
tha railways should be authorised
to make rate Increases to meet
higher wsges and to provide soma
sort of machinery for arbitration
for similar disputes In the future,
possibly along the lints of the
Canadlsn Commission.
When ho finished conferring with
Senators Kern and Nowlands Presi
dent Wilson came to tho door of his
room and said to Inquirers:
"I camo hero on certain matters of
legislation. That Is all I can say
now."
Then, after making the foregoing
announcement, President Wilson re
turned to tho White Houso without
conferring with any ono else and
without making any further explana
tion of his visit. Senator Newlands
Mtatod positively that no Joint session
of Congress had been arranged.
RAILWAY HEADS SILL WORK

to tho Capitol was taken as Indica
ting that tho situation had reached

railway executives still wero work
Ing on their communication to Prcsl
dent Wilson.
Among tho railway executives It
was said that any plan for legisla
tion suggested by tho President would
havo to 'bn considered but that tha
inclination of the railway heads was
to utand solidly on their demand for
arbitration of the present dispute.
At 1 o'clock to-day The Evening
World representative, through tho
courtesy of one of tho railroad presi
dents, was allowed to look over tho
draft of Urn final answer of tho mil
road systems of tl United States to

Ah has been hinted earlier, tho doc

Tho railroads concede nothing. The

hands down without the semblancu
of a fight, though some of tho ses
sions havo unmi well Into fifteen and
twonty hours at a stretch.
CAN'T ACCEPT 8-HOUR DAY AS
PRESENTED.
Tho document Itself Is couched In
dignified und restrained language. In
substaiK'o It reads:
"Mr. Piesldent: Wo havo given tho

the relations of employers and em

to-day.
Secretary I.anc, tho President's chief
adviser In difficulties of such magni
tude, was summoned to tho White
House early to-day. When he came
out, he said to tho Halting reporters:
"It Is no tlmd to deny that tho situ

what we are facing now Is not final."
Halo Holden, Judge Lovett and
Daniel Wllard will go to tho White
