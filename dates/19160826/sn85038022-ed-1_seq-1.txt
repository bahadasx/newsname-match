Washington, August 25 After the
heads of the four great railroad
llrotherhoods, threatening a nation
wide strike, had gone to tho White
House today with a warning that
their men would not wait longer thar
tomorrow night for a reply from tin
railroad executives to President Wil
son's suggestion that an eight-hour
day bu granted, the executives tonight
agreed upon a counter proposal to be
bubmttted to the President tomorrow.
This plan, holding to the demand for
arbitration which the employes have
declared they unalterably oppose
proposes :
That the question of an eight-hour
day is not directly connected with the
matter at issue and that there is a
difference between an actual eight
hour day and an eight-hour day as a
basis for pay:
That question of increases of wages
are indisputably questions which
should be settled by arbitration;
That the present demands of the
trainmen be submitted to arbitration
by the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion or some board to be created by
the President or in some other way;
Finding to be Itetroarthe
That if the arbitrating board finds
wage increases should be granted
their finding will be retroactive and
the increase will take effect from the
time the arbitration begins:
That a fund shall be created by the
railroads to provide for this contin
gency, the Interstate Commerce Com
mission to keep the accounts that
will be necessary, and the arrange
ment to determined upon, the men
agreeing that during the period of ar
bitration there shall be no further de
mands nor any attempt to strike.
A draft of this report was submitted
tonight by the committee of eight
presidents who have been constantly
at work upon its various phases f)r
a week. There was some discussion
but only one vote was taken, and by
it the sixty presidents and managers
approved the draft. Some slight ad
ditions to the phraseology are to be
made and the filial draft presented a
another meeting tomorrow morning.
Filial Report of ExeentlTe
From that meeting the report Is ex
pected to be taken to President Wll
son. It was said tonight this will be
the final report of the executives.
"It puts the Issue squarely up to
tho men," was the way one officer
phrased It.
The crisis in the situation Is ex
pected by noon tomorrow, when the
President has an engagement to see
the Brotherhood leaders.

About midnight last night Deputy
Sheriff Mike Brown, together with
Chief of Police James Mackey and one
of the local officers raided the home
of Will Hunter, colored, at Washing
ton, and found there a great deal of
whiskey stored away beneath a stair
way. He will be given a trial within
the next few days.
Mr. Drown has for some time been
trying to get enough evidence togeth
er to get a case on Hunter and It was
not until within the past few days
that this evidence was secured. When
the officers raided the home they
found three baskets of whiskey and a
government license for 1K16 hid away
The whiskey was confiscated and
Hunter brought to Maysville and
lodged in jail.
It is said that Hunter has been sell
ing liquor in Washington for the past
Mtraral years but It seems as if evi
dence to that effect was very hard to
get. The officers claim to have the
affidavits of quite a number of citizens
or that neighborhood, saying that thev
have purchased whiskey at various
times from Hunter. He Is reported as
huving made a small sized fortune
during the time he has been Belling
boozo.
The trial of Hunter will be held
within the next few days.
