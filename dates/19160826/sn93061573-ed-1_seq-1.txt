OPINION
As the grounds for a change of
venue from thus District to the
Fourth Juliicial district are substan
tially the same in the two above
entitled cases, the Court will lile the
same apininn and ordered in each
case.
Hriefly stated, the grounds upon
which the defendant, bases his ap
plication for a change of venue are,
that the Judge oí thi court is a
ninterial witness in his behalf: dial
the Judge of Court is biased
and prejudiced against him. and,
when the defendant Was suspended
from ollice. the .Indue of Ibis Court
appointed one, T. J. Crumley, who
was a '"bitter partisan enemy .if the
defendant", as acting- sheriff, and
Ibat defendant fears that with the
Judge of Ibis court presiding, and
the said Crumley acting as sheriff,
they will "so influence and prejud
ice the minds oí the people of (his
county against the defendant. Ibat
it will be impossible for him to ob
tain a fair and impartial tral."
Takng up (he allegation that the
Judge of this Court is a material
witness for the defendant, and has
been subpoenaed, etc., it is sutlici
ent answer to say that said Judge
-J.mVi hihijiK i.t iiehalf of defend
ant that would be competent evid
ence in this case., defendant's at
torneys have stated that they wish
to prove by said Judge that the de
fendant had writen him, calling at
tention to certain violations of the
anti-gambling law. It is true that
in the letter part of HM-'.or the early
part of 3, the defendant did write
"aid Judge that one Carl Eklund. or
Clayton, was violating the gambling
law and defying him and his dep
uties. That, however, was long pri
or to any transactions of the defend
ant, set uii in this cause. Moreover,
the letter in question was at once
turned oyer to the district Attorney,
for investigation and aotion thereon. ,
The letter itself would be the best i
evidence of what it contained, and
any testimony of said Judge, upon
, i
inai point, under law, would be clear
iy incompetent, and, therefore, in -
admissible.
As to the allegations of bias and
prejudice, snown in securing evi
dence, the Judge of this Court has
had nothing to do with securing the
evidence on behalf of the sjate. That
is no part of his duties, in his or in
any other case. He has left that in !
the hands of the attorneys represent -
ing the State, where it rightfully
belongs. In this case, as in all cases
be has permitted them to go ahead
and use their own best judgment as
io wnai means they should pursue
to obtain legitimate and truthful ev
idence. He is confident they would
not seek or use any other kind.
It is charged that the said Judge is
biased and prejudiced, because the
evidence beard hv him nn.i t m.

preliminary hearing, "even true, was
wholly insufficient to justify the sus
pension by the Court of the defend
ant." This is the position that
nearly every defeated litigant takes,
and, in no sense, would disqualify
tho Judge from passing upon such
questions of law as may arise at the
trial. ,
Another reason charged is that ai
ter said Judge had heard the evi
dence at the preliminary hearing,
and before rendering his opinion, he
sent for T. J. Crumley, and asked
hifn if he would accept the appoint
ment as acting sheriff. We cau con
ceive of nothing more natural or
proper,, under such circumstances.
Of course, the Court, having made, up
its mmd that it was iU duty to re-

Tin:
I move the defendant, mid thus create
u vacancy would naturally look
around to liud some one to till such
vacancy. Whether in appointing Mr.
Crumley it appointed a "bitter par
tisan enemy of the defendant", the
Court did not then, and does not now
know. Mr. Crumley was ipointed
solely opon bis record as a peace of
ficer, and the Court took nothing else
into consideration.
In his application for a change of
venue, the defendant expressly
charges that, although lie has always
been anxious to have a speedy trial,
he has been prevented by the actions
of the Court from having one.
Let us see what the facts are in
regard to this.

The Court, therefore, had nothing to
do with preventing either case from
going to trial. They were prevented
from going to trial by the actions
ami agreements of the defendant
himself.

Court that they waived any effect

the Court, denying the petition as
a matter of right, we will now consid

ed in this opinion flight, as a matter
of conscience, cause the Court to
refuse to bear this case, and send
Hie same to some other Judge and
some other Judicial district, for tri
al. There is scarcely a closely con
tested case in which, before the is-
su.vt are finally determined, the
Court does imt deride questions aris
