Three princes of the Catholic
church, the Papal Delegate to the
United States, the Papal Nuncio to
Brazil, scores of Bishops and other
dignitaries, several hundred priests
and thousands of layjwen partici
pated in the celebratic , "of the sol
emn pontifical high mass at St. Pat
rick's Cathedral Sunday that
lnarked' the formal opening in New
Yoik City of the fifteenth annual
convention of the A'merican Federa
tion of Catholic Societies and the
sixty-first annual convention of the
National Federation of German
Catholics. It was estimated that
more than 8,000 persons ciowdeil
Into tho Cathedral, while twice at
many more congregated outside to
view tho procession which preceded
the mass. At the opening of the
ceremonies, Monsignor Michael J.
Lavelle, rector of the Cathedral,
read a message from Cardinal Gas
parrl. Papal Secretary of State; in
which he said:
"The Holy Father will watch
with a loving and paternal eye the
Federation of Catholic Societies of
the United States, holding their an
nual convention. He sends earnest
wishes that their friendly discus
sions shall accomplish much for the
welfaie and honor of the Catholic
name in your favored land. And
while hoping for the most consol
ing results from your concord, ac
tivity and wisdom, he grants most
heartily the apostolic benediction to
the federation and to all who take
part In it."
American and Papal flags were
hung above tho Cathedral Entrance,
with great streamers of yellow and
white, the Papal colors, suspended
from each arch inside. High above
all the decorations hung the red
hat of the late Cardinal McCIoskey,
suspended from the arched ceiling
over the chancel. Three temporary
canopied thrones were erected
within the chancel for Cardinals
Gibbons and O'Connell and Arch
bishop Bonzano, Papal Delegate to
tho United States. Cardinal Farley,
who sang the mass, occupied the
permanent throne within the chan
cel. Lay delegates led the proces
sion into the Cathedral and several
hundred priests In black cassocks
and white surplices lined the center
aisle while the Cardinals, Arch
bishops, Bishops and MonslgnorJ,
with their attendants, filed past.
Fifty altar boys and the officers of
the mass attended Cardinal Farley.
The Cathedral choir of Pittsburg,
numbering 150 male voices, assisted
the high choir of St. Patrick's in
chanting tho ordinary of the mass
from the chancel. Bishop Thomas
F. Hickey, of Rochester, preached
tho sermon.
The annual report, of Joseph
Frey, President of the German Ro
man Catholic Central Vereln, re
ferred to "the swaying attitude of
our Government" with lespect to
Mexico, and declared that in the
qplnlon of our best thinkers and
leaders our so-called prosperity,
chiefly due to traffic in munitions
of war, will meet with an abrupt
termination when peace shall have
been established"
The opening session of the Fed
eration was devoted In part to hear
ing the reports of the National
President, John Whalen, and of the
National Secretary, Anthony Matre.
An address was delivered by the
Right Rev. M. J. Lavelle, rector of
St. Patrick's Cathedral. .At the
afternoon session the delegates
heard a report of the commission
on public morals, of which Edward
Feeney is Chairman and Jeremiah
E. Burke, of Boston, spoke on "The
Catholic Church and Education."
Social service problems were con
sidered at a mass meeting, at which
Bishop Muldoon, of Rockford, 111.,
delivered the opening address. The
minimum wage and living wages for
working- women were 'among tho
subjects discussed. .
Sessions of the Catholic Young
Men's National Union, the Catholic
Womah'8 Union 'and the State
League of Catholic Societies were
held Monday morning and afternoou
and Monday night there was a mass
meeting for Catholic women.
Business sessions of tho Federa
tion and its allied organizations
were held Tuesday morning, when
some of tho subjects discussed In
the reports of President Joseph
Frey, of the" Vereln, and of An
thony Matre. Secretary of the Fed
eration, were taken up tor consid
eration. Mr. Matre in his report
criticized some of the features of
modern life which he regarded as
evil, including phases of Jhe mbvlng
picture business, easy divorces, im
proper plays and attacks on Chris
tianity. A women's 'session of' the
Federation was a feature of the
morning f programme. At night
there was a mass meeting under the
auspices of the Central Vereln and
the Young Men's Union attended a
banquet.
Reporting for the Committee .on
Public Moral, Chairman Feeney's
-uUrets was aJcttuniislfed for its
, prabM of Jeas WlTlard and Billy
Sunday and Its attack on Bishop
Homer C. Stuntz, Methodist, for
proposing to evangelize South and
Central America", which have been
In the Catholic zone of influence for
many years. Last April Bishop
Stuntz made a pathetic appeal to
rich Protestants of the United
States to save the South American
Catholics from perdition. He ap
pealed for some of the millions
that are wasted on the pagans of
China and India. Concluding Chair
man Feeney said: "Our friend Billy
Sunday who wisely said he could
never make a good Protestant out
of a bad Catholic, could induce
more Methodists to hit tho trail
here In a week's campaign than
'Bishop Stuntz could bring to the
mourner's bench in South America
In a hundred years. Bishop Stuntz
Is wasting valuable time, likewise
good American dollars. Come back
to your homo town, Brother Stuntz,
and get busy on the backsliders."
Establishment of a 'minimum
wage fjr all workers, was urged at
the social service 'meeting, when
the speakers were Bishop Muldoon,
Rockford, 111.; tho Rev. Edwin V.
O'Hara, Chairman of the Oregon
State Commission on the Minimum
Wage, and the Rev. John A. Ryan,
uf the Catholic University, AVash
tngton, D. C.
The convention completed its
wVirk Wednesday, when John
"tfhelan, of New York, the Presi
dent and all other officers were
re-elocte'd except Joseph T. Bren
nan, of Boston, Sixth Vice Presi
dent, who was succeeded by Dr.
Peter S. Ganz, bffr Louisville. The
convention will ymeet In Kansas
"City next year. Tho final session
was enlivened by an unexpected
exchange of opinions concerning tho
non-Catholic attitude toward Cath
olics. M3ol. Patrick Henry Calla
han, of Louisville, declared that
the flve-slxths non-Catholic portion
of tho citizens of tho country are
fair In the treatment of tho Cath
olic sixth. Joseph T. Brennnn, of
Boston, after creating some little
excitement in demanding an oppor
tunity to reply, said:
"With all due respect to this
prominent gentleman, what he says
is SILLY. That talk about tolerance
Is soft soap. I can speak officially
for Massachusetts only, but there
the non-Catholic five-sixths are not
fair to the Catholics. There we
spend ?4, 000, 000 a year for tbo
maintenance of institutions and the
State pays nothing. And why toler
ance? We are Americans with the
right to be .here and need no toler
ance and accept none."

IRELAND
Eileen Moore Spends Three
Weeks in Old Land in War
Time.
Arrives in Now York and Tells
of Her Experience in
Dublin.
Indignation Expressed Over
Treatment Accorded AVomcn
Prlsioners.
CITY IS FILLED WITH SOLDIERS
Following is one of -a series of
articles written by Eileen Moore for
the Irish Press and News Service,
ln..whlclu..sho xptatesAtho atory of.
her three weeks' experience in Ire
land In war time;. .
1 ai rived in New York on August
12 after three weeks' stay in Dub
lin. Dublin is seething with re
bellion. This fact Is made evident
to the stranger by the general wear
ing of the Republican badge. Every
'second man, woman and child is
Still flaunting the tiicolor a tiny
knot of orange, green and white
ribbon. Thero is another thing that
strikes the stranger In Dublin r-the
unmistakeable poverty of Its peo
ple. To walk through the city and
note the excessive number of
wretchedly clad women with chil
dren in their arms and hunger in
their face's would make anyone sad.
Poverty stalks openly in Dublin.
The weather is fine I shiver at the
thought of the sufferings that will
ensue when the cold sets in. There
Is a coal strike on and already
great difficulty is experienced in
getting in coal except by those lucky
people who had ordered it months
ahead. Tho Dominican Sisters, who
have charge of a working girls'
home In Domlnick street, report
great suffering among working
girls.
In the city tho conversation turns
Irresistibly to the l evolution like a
needle to a magnet In the stores
many thrilling stories of tho hero
ism of tho girls who helped in the
"rlsin " are told in a half whisper
while measuring yards of ribbon or
Irish lace. One shop assistant said:
"I know a girl who was caught car
rying a disnatch. The soldiers
threatened to shoot her, but shei
swallowed the dispatch before they
cbuld take It from her. It was
written on gelatine. They threw
her Into prison she has since been
released. Wasn't she quick witted?"
said the shop assistant. Most of
tho girls employed in the 'stores had
relatives in the revolution. Geneial
Indignation Is expressed all over at
the treatment accorded women pris
oners. Gently nurtured women and
girls were thrown Into prison in
batches and a plank bed with sparse
covering supposedly for one person
was allotted to three.- The rest had
to lie on the floor. Their health
has suffered in consequence. The
food was of the coarest quality. Not
women- warders were allowed them
and it might be said with truth that
they were left to the mercy of the
soldiers. Even people not in favor
of the Sinn Fein movement were
Incensed when they heard of tho
hardships these women suffered.
History repeats itself. Just as
the Geraldlne Intermarried with tho
Irish and becamo more Irish than
the Irish themselves, so after the
first two weeks df brutal treatment
tho fair prisoners won their gaolers
and were treated during the weeks
that followed with mdre leniency.
Admiration was openly expressed at
the courage of these gently reared
young Irish girls who threw caution
to the winds and were ready to give
their lives for the cause. The same
niay pe said of the men prisoners
and their gaolers, so that' Instead of
putting down "Sinn Felnlsm" by im
prisonment tne uovornment is ,De
glnnlng to find out that it is only

der your very eyes, yes, through
your very malls, which we 'pay for,
we are Insulted, scurVulously ma
ligned and openly vilified, then 'you
are not keeping your contract that
is not liberty. You are only
wounding the hand, the strongest
hand held out to help you; you
are spurning the aid of those who
again and again you have found in
your hour of direst need the most
willing to die for you. Oh, yes, we
know very well the whole litany of
accusations against us. We give
only a divided allegiance. We are
scheming for government.. These
are an lies so patent mat they need
no answer. Indeefl those who fling
them out will never listen to any
answer. But I dm going to answer
them once nnd forever here to
night. As a Cardinal I may be sup
posed to know what I am saying on
this subject. And on my word as
a gentleman of honor I am speak
ing the simple, absolute truth. I
have known Intimately, personally
and officially threo sovereign Pon
tiffs three Popes of the Catholic
church. I am a priest now thirty
two years; I am a Bishop fifteen
years and a Cardinal five years. I
have had the closest relations with
not only tho Pope, "but the. whole
Roman curia; I know well every
priest in my diocese and every
Bishop In this country. Yet never,
never in all that experience have I
ever heard spoken, lisped or
whispered, or even hinted, by any
or all of these, anything concerning
Ameilca and American Institutions
but words of affection, of tender
and kindliest solicitude for her wel
fare; never a syllable that could
not be printed in the boldest type
and distributed throughout the
land; neither plot nor scheme nor
plan but only sentiments of ad
miration and love. If there 1s plot
ting I ought to know it. Yet ab
solutely and honestly of such things
I have never heard oven a, whiper.
This is my answer to all these in
sinuations. That I know the truth,
I thinkj no one wjll deny; that after
such a pledge I am still concealing
the truth, that I must Icavo to those
who, I repeat, will never listen to
my answer.
Tho Catholic civil allegiance di
vided? Why, look across the sea
to where all Europe Is in arms.
Every Catholic Is fighting 'loyally,
giving his very life for r his own
country. And though some of these
countries havo merited little grati
tude, from any Catholic, still the
very pilests are In the trenches,
each a defender of his native land.
Where I ask of any honest witness
of these facts under his very eyes,
where is this divided civil alle
giance? And the Pope Is thero
one In this country who, after this
war, will ever dare to accuse tho
Pope of Interference In civil affairs
or of weakening 'the -loyalty of cit
izens? Behold him, the Universal
Fatljer of tho faithful, looking out
over the world and weeping and
praying for the peace of all the
nations, offering solace and counsel
to all alike- a lonely pathetic figure
like Christ begging the world to
listen that he may heal all and help
all. The worl'd knows the truth
today or tho position of the Pope
In relation to all the nations. Not
another vord Is needed.
Our country Ihe land which,
above all others we love most God
keep you, free from such enemies,
tho worst of all that confronts you,
whose hate would rob your most
faithful sons of that for which they
lovo you liberty, tiue liberty,
blessed Holy Liberty tho freedom
to worship God. Beyond our lives
we love our faith, and with these
same lives wo stand ready to defend
the land which gives us llbe'rty.
These aie the sentiments of every
Catholic throughout the land; these
the sentiments of every member of
the Catholic Federation of America.
It is that these sentiments may be
better understood and more widely
known that the federation exists
and works and strives.
There is but one thing in all this
world that for these millions of
toileis can lighten their burden and
lessen tho weight of their labor. It
is that sacred light shining through
the gloom of the workman's life
which converts his heavy burden
into a joyous hope. It is that
sacred spark of heavenly life,
which amid all the benumbing petti
ness of a Sordid Hfo gives him the
courage and the spirit of life, his
eyes to the, level of every man,
however far above him, with a sure
sense of fundamental equality. It is
the knowledge that he is a man as
any other man whatever his station;
that he Is neither chattel, nor thing,
nor .possession, but an individual, a
person, free In body, in mind and
heait; in a. word, the one thing that
constitutes his earthly happiness is
his freedom. That is the wealth
dear to the human heart boyond
all the kingdoms of the world. And
'that, more than all .else, Infinitely
more than all the treasures of this
country, is the very heart and core
of the love we all bear for America.
It is because America is the home
of freemen and because over all
alike waves her sacred banner of
liberty that we love her with a love
next only to that we owe the king
dom of God.

SHERLEY'S ELECTION ASSURED
Becoming frightened at the fiz
zle of the Hughes campaign tour
and realizing that the Republican
nominee for President is losing
ground dally, the Republican Cam
paign Committee, against their will,
have been forced to bring Roosevelt
in the limelight, and the latter will
begin his speaking tour next Thurs
day, his first speech be'lng made at
Lewiston, Maine. After extending
the invitation to the Roifgh Rldor
the Republican Campaign Commit
tee became panic-stricken when
Ropsevelt announced that he was
the boy that would nut the "nunch"
In the campaign and that on next
Thursday he will lake the hyphen
ates from a to Izzard, meaning that
he will deliver a tirade of Insults
against the Germani-American peo
ple for daring to oven sympathize
with the land of their forefathers.
Anyway It Is a certainty that tho
Kougn Kider will break loose and
the noor G. O. P. will bn hetwpn
the devil and the deep blue sea. On.
the one httnd Hughes is delivering
campaign speeches without making
any impression except that of dis
appointing tho people, who expected
the orations of a statesman, but to
date have heard nothing but tho
campaign talks of a petty poli
tician. On the other hand Roosevelt
will come out strong with circus
oratory, insulting everyone who
won't agree with him, and is cer

among the Progressives, who are
not falling all over themselves to '

his betrayal of the Bull Moose party
was their principal grievance.
The situation in California Is pretty
near a criterion to go by. Candi
date Hughes went there this past
week, srfubbed Gov. Hlrani Johnson,
tne moi or the Progressives, and
when beseeched to compel the Re
publicans of that State to give tho
Progressives an even break In that
section he fuither widened tho
breach In hla first speech by saying
ho would not interfere with petty
pontics. Chester Howell, the Repub
lican leader of California, inter
viewed tho next day, .said "Hughes
certainly spilled the beans" and that
the Progressive support was lost to
the Republican cause. The New
York Tribune, a Republican organ,
says that the National Committed
has been bombarded with telegramg
and lettors from Progressives pro
testing against their treatment by
Hughes and tho California Republi
can leaders.
Kentu'cky Democrats are more
than pleased with the sltuatlbn,
Congressman J. Campbell Cantrill,
Campaign Chairman, having re
ceived the pledged support of every
Democratic leader In tho State, all
promising to give their best efforts
to roll up an old-time Democratic
majority. It Is significant that in
this campaign there Is no faction
sulking or indifferent and the Demo
cratic press Is leading the fight for
Wilson and the Congiessional nom
inees. The Republicans on tho
other hand are far from united, the
throw-down given to tho McCulloch
faction at Chicago leaving many
sore spots, while many of the party
resent the dictation of National
Committeeman Hert, who sprang
Into the leadership with a bound,
none of tho Kentucky Republicans
being close enough to the new
leader to assure them of political
pie in case of success. The old
guard believe that If Hughes Is
successful tho rewards will be given
to new men in the ranks, mep who
have not been identified with the
party, and like Hert, were unknown,
until t,hls year.
Locally the Democrats are satis
fied with their prospects and the
greatest tribute paid to them is the
fact ' that Campaign Chairmah
Cantrill is emulating the example
of local Chairman Frank McGrath
and is forming a precinct organiza
tion throughout the State. This
precinct organization method in Jef
ferson county has been the secret
of local party success, the majori
ties In this district tho last several
campaigns being tho salvation of
Senator peckham and Gov. Stanley.
Congressman Sherloy will not only
receive the solid Democratic vote
hero, but will yecelve four-fifths of.
the independent and Progressive
vote, many of whom are not looking
kindly on the candidacy of Republi
can nominee Owens, whom they
designate as tho "man of many par
ties," ho being a Petnocrat, Pro
gressive and Republican la a short
space eftlme.
