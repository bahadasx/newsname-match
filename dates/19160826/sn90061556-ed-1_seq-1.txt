Miss Alberta Georgo White, the
subject of this sketch, first saw the
light of day seventeen, years ago In
Louisville, Ky. She Is the daughter
of Mrs. Sallie J. S. White, who with
her children removed to this city
nearly six years ago. Her father, the
late Albert S. White, was one of the
ablest lawyers the race has produced.
During the Roosevelt administration
ho was appointed field revenue agent
with headquarters in Louisville cus
tom house. The Columbian conclud
ed an editorial on his death thus:
Truly a great man has fallen In
Israel;
Peace to his ashes and rest to his
soul.
During her first school year In this
city, 1911, Alberta won a gold medal,
as first prize given by the W. C, T.
,U. for the best essay on "The Inju
rious Effects of ToTbacco Upon the
Human System." Jn -presenting the
prize the president said that she
hoped that she would grow up to be
a teacher in this city and that physi
ology would bo one of the subjects
taught by her, as her paper showed
such splendid research. She was val
edictorian of her class when gradu
ating from the ward school In 1912,
and completed the High School course
with the remarkable record averaging
100 the entire four years, winning the.
$50 scholarship given by the Kansas
City Medical Society. She was 'also
precented a gold medal by the Lin
coln High Alumni. She will matricu
late at Kansas University September
11th, and we bid her God speed,, hop
ing that sho will ever keep above the
tldo thte blue and tho gold.
Her mother, Mrs. Sallie J. .S. White,
is thot daughter of Rev. George W.
Seals, one of tho most prominent Bap
tist ministers of his day, before her
marriage for several years.edlted the
Colored Department in the Louisville
Commercial,- now known as tho
Herald. She also,-gave daily reports
of conferences, conventions' and the
like. After tho cyclone devastated
Louisville, a number of years ago,
Mrs. White staged a play which she
had written for the benefit of the
Colored Odd Fellows, whose hall was
destroyed, realizing $400. She refused
many flattering offers to enter pro-
fessional life upon the stage. Mrs. i
White has always, been a suffragist,
even in her girlhood days, but says 1
she has still greater reasons for her I
belief in votes for women, since her
long" association with her husband
during his law practice her attention
being attracted to the laws concerning
women, watched a number of cases In
different parts of the country where
scoundrel's betrayed girls, mere chil
dren, and escaped punishment by
means of that nefarious, law the age
of consent then she began to think
what effect tho ballot In tho hands
of women would have on this 'and
other laws concerning the .sex. Do
you think, says Mrs. White, that If
the women of Mississippi or Georgia
had the ballot and wore wide awake
to its value, that there would be
among their statutes n. law making the
age of consent so Infamously low as
ten .years, or would tho women of
Kentucky stand for such at twelvo
years, when with tho use of the bal
lot they could readily remove from
tho legislative halls tha men who re
fuse to repeal said measures, making
it 21, At present I do not think it
is this in more than two or perhaps
three states. Mrs. White, was elected
president of tho Kindergarten Asso
ciation in 1902.. Much of the success
of this movement was' due to her in
defatigable efforts." Tho said associ
ation made it possible for colored
glrln to graduate ' as said teachers.
The Women's Improvement Club, of
which she was vice president, sup
ported tho first kindergarten placed
In a Negro school, the board of edu
cation giving the room only, the club
paying $45 monthly to a teacher and
furnishing all material. Thus the
dub and tho association .combined
blazed a way for the placing of kin
dergartens in Negro schools. Mrs.
White was presented a handsome sil
ver sugar spoon by the graduating
class of kindergarteners of 1904. She
wa? also presented a silver ' butter
dish by the Women's Improvement
,Club. In 1905 she was elected vice
president of the first Play Ground
Association of Louisville, and during
the most important season she was
practically president, as Prof. Perry
was in Chicago, taking a medical
course. So interested was she in this
movement that she with Miss G. A.
Mooro personally superived the play
ground. Mrs. White is a member of
the A. M. E. church, a charter mem
ber of the Addle Allen Chapter, Or
der of Eastern Star, and a member
of the Golden Rule Temple, S. M. T.
She came to this city after having
suffered a nervous breakdown, due to
grief, worry and .mental strain, so
following the advice of her physician
she has done work of various kinds
calculated to bring physical exhaus
tion, keeping the mind as free as pos
sible. Even that did not bring the
much craved for sleep, but Christian
Science did. This coupled with the
fact that she felt that being in a new
city, away from afTTelatlves, her chil
dren needed her presence at all times,
she thought it best to do anything"
that would leave her at home. Al
though Mrs. White gave her children
the most attentive care, she never
theless appeared from time to time
during her entire married life not
only ln the churches of her home city
but in-nearby, states, elther'in'recffal,
lecture br speech', advocating some
cause touching on human rights. As
a result of her many sided experi
ences she hopes some time in the
near future to give the reading public
a social work, dealing with the. prob
lems of today. The book will be ded
icated to her daughter, Mrs. Sallie S.
White Harris, who died in this city
one year ago. Mrs. Harris was a
graduato from the Lincoln High
School class 1912. Immediately after
her graduation sho took the teacher's
examination, making an average of
79, with 75 'in arithmetic, which was
considered remarkable for one iust
out of tho High School. She taught
two years, was married October, 1914,
and died September, 1915. Her death
was a sad blow to the family and also
to friends.
All persons who would enjoy an

LET FREEDOM RING,
O, could I but wrlto stories
, For movingplcturo plays,
I would write one from history
Of cruel slavery days.
It would tell how the black man,
These many years ago,
Was lured by the white traders,
From his own country's shorn.
It would show tho trading ship
With the Dutch in command;
I'd give a view of Jamestown,
The place the old ships land.
I would show those white planters,
Without regret or shame, ,
Enslaving the poor Negroes
For their greed of gold to gain,
I would show the white's mansion,
His great wealth In display,
Earned by those poor Negro slaves
Who labored day by day. ,,
Then comes the Negro's cabin,
Standing in'the lane,
And mammy with her children
There, you see, the white man's shame.
How comes the mulatto child,
i A cruel white, man's, lust?
Tom Dixon and Griffiths fame
A renegade their Gus.
Our country called the whites to arms,
The black man's left on guard, r
Gus did not rape his mistress,
There & no black child in her yard.
They called the Negro soldiers,
With bayonet and guns,
To tho war they bravely marched,
Fought hard, their freedom won.
Then comes reconstruction days;
Those coward Ku-Klux-Klan,
I would expose their vengeance
Wreaked on the poor Negro man.
Final, the twentieth century;
A beautiful scene to see,
Progress of the Negroes
After fifty years free.
We would wave the stars and'stripes.
In one stirring voice would sing
Down with segregation,
Let Freedom Loudly Ring.

They demonstrated their superiority

with the exception of one or two were
not as spectacular owing to the fact
that the opponents were not able to

KANSAS CITY DECORATING FOR
THE BAPTISTS.
Patriotism has already begun ,to
show itself in tho preparations for the
entertainment of the National Baptist
Convention, which is to meet here in
September. This was evidenced when
the committee, consisting of Drs. J.
W- Hurse, J. B. Beckham and J. R.
Williams, announced this week that
the national colors had been adopted
as the decoration for tho two Kansas
Cities during the week of the Conven
tion. In addition to this they have
decided to placard the homes of the
citizens on which they are to use the
photos and drawings of the most dis
tinguished men of their connection.
Dr. Beckham stated this week that
the committee wapted that the people
of tho West should see the "little, un
known R. F. D.'s, who would be lnj
Kansas City at the coming National'
Baptist Convention, unincorporated,!
Whllo he declared, as did the other J
working with him on the committee,,
that there would be some of tho most 1
stalwart figures in the religious world '
at tho meeting, many of them had per
haps not been seen on a public plat-1
form as members of the National Ban-1
tlst Convention. It Is said that this)
meetlnsr will bring out- more Intel-1
lect, more culture, more 'wealth, more I
men that have achelved big things for
tho Negro Baptists during their day
and generation than any similar
meeting. The committee has received
information of more than a half doz
en special train movements and they,
gave out this week there would be
three solid special trains from Tex
as, one from Southwest and West
Texas, one from South and East Tex
as, another one from North Texas;
two special trains from Louisiana, one
eminating at New Orleans that would
bring the South Louisiana, Mobile
and Alabama delegations, the other
from' North Louisiana, that would
take in a portion of Arkansas and
Texas; another special train from
Mississippi which is to be made up
at Vlcksburg, the home of tho presi
dent, and come direct through to St.
Louis and fronihejeovansas City.
Another special from" Tennessee that
is to start at Nashville will go
through by St. Louis. The Florida
special starts at Jacksonville, and is
said to be coming over tho famous
Dixie Flyer Route. The Carolina
Special train is to take the "Carolina
Special Route" by Cincinnati and St.
Louis. The Kentucky delegation will
blaze the way and call it the "Blue
Grass State" Route. There is to be
an Indiana Special from Indianapo
lis, while the Eastern delegation
from as far as Hartford, Conn., will
come direct, so it is learned on the
famous New Yorker, and will be join
ed by the Virginia, Washington and
Maryland delegations which come
from New York to St. Louis without
change. Tho Illinois delegation will
join the Chicago people ,on their
route, as it is understood there will
be as many as seventy-five out of
Chicago who will swoop down on the
Santa Fe, going through without
change. An Oklahoma Special is to
come over, starting at Muskogee and
Oklahoma City, coming together en
route. Then the Missouri delegation
starting at St. Louis is to bring up
the rear.
A conservative estimate of the at
tendance as far as the local commit
tee has been able to ascertain will be
approximately 2,000. The chorlnter,
"who is to have charge of the singing
during the week, it is said, will be on
the grounds ten days prior to the
opening. All in all, Kansas City,
aside from putting on a patriotic air,
has begun to assume a business-like
attitude and is making steady prep
arations for the little R. F. D. and
unknown Baptists that are going to
come here in September.
As the opening attraction at the
Lincoln Electric Park, Kansas City,
Mo., during the week of tho National
Negro Business League, August 14
20, tho management gave their thou
sands of patrons a much welcomed
treat in the presentation of that beau
tiful and wonderful race photo-play,
"Realization of a Negro's Ambition."
This educational and interesting
picture marks the beginning of a new
era In the production of Race pic
tures. Feeling that tlfb trend of pub
lic sentiment among the Race lovers
of the silent drama is growing so an
tagonistic to tho Insulting, humilia
ting and undignified portryal of the
cheap burlesque, slap-stick comedies
so universally shown as characteris
tic of the Afro-American ideals, the
Lincoln Motion Picture Co. of Los
Angeles Cal., a Raco firm, has in
their first release successfully elimi
nated these undesirable features and
produced a really Interesting, inspir
ing and commendable educational
love drama featuring the business and
social life of tho Negro, as it really
is and not as our jealous contempo
raries would have us appear.
This classy two reel drama, "Real
ization of a Negro's Ambition," fea
turing the author, Noblo M. Johnson,
as star, and Miss Beulah Hall as lead
ing lay, Is owned, acted and produced
entirely by the Race. Tho play is a
social story, the scenes being laid
principally among the business and
social setting of Los Angeles' Col
ored "400." James Burton, a young
civil engineer from Tuskegee, 3eeks
his fortune in the far West. How
James rescues his future employer's
daughter, thereby securing a position
in the oil fields in spite of racial
prejudice, strikes oil and returns
home later, wealthy, becoming an in
nocent victim of a jealous frame-up
Involving a boyhood sweetheart; nev
ertheless he proposes and is accept
ed, Is told in two exceedingly inter
esting reels.
The picture is a very clean, Inter,
esting drama, minus all burlesque and
suggestive features. The production
is very good. The atmosphere of the
picture is remarkable, and the illu
sion of reality maintained from be
ginning to end. Aided by several
thrills, clean comedy, some very pret
ty scenes and excellent photography,
the picture leaves little to be desired
from an artistic standpoint. As. an
initial picture it is very good. The
directors might have reworked the ti
tles to. an advantage, -but even as It
stands the picture offers entertain
ment of a satisfactory and above the
average order and is sure to prove
a winner.
This picture was shown at tha Vine
Street Theatre, 24th and Vine streets,
before a large and appreciative audience.
ALLEN CHAPEL.
Many visitors were present at the
morning services. The minister
preached. At the conclusion of the
services Miss Freeman very forcibly
and eloquently set forth the construc
tive work that the organization for
the Advancement of tho Colored Peo
ple was trying to do. She told of the
financial aid many whites were giv
ing, but said the work principally
must bo done by us. A collection of
$4Q was takenn for that cause. The
pastor then Introduced Colonel Ros
coe Conkltn Simmons of Louisville,
Ky. Colonel Simmons is a polished
orator, possibly the ablest before the
country today. He held the audience
spellbound for thirty minutes.

MADAME C. J. WALKER
VISITS THE CITY
America's Best Known Hair Culturist Attends
National Business League and Reports
Progress of 11 Years
FROM CABIN TO CASTLE
Perhaps tho most interesting story
ever related on the subject, "Woman,"
Is that told of the life, achievements
and progress of that most wonderful,
clever, aggressive and far-seeing per
sonage, Madame C. J. Walker, the
only woman of her race who has
achieved such excellent results In the
short period of eleven years.
Madam C. J. Walker was born in
Delta, La., December 25, 1867. Her
parents were Owen and Minerva
Breedlove. Reared on a farm' until
10 years of age, she then moved to
Vlcksburg, Miss. She was left an or
phan at the age of seven years, under
the care of a sister and cruel brother-in-law.
She married at the age of
fourteen, in order to get a home. She
was left a widow at the age of twenty,
with one child, a little girl. She moved
from Vlcksburg to St. Louis, Mo.,
where she lived for eighteen years.
She reared and educated her daugh
ter, enduring many hardships and
much toil. In 1905 she discovered a
as one of the most active in its com
mercial walks, and her business qual
ifications and integrity are unques
tioned. She is a member of Bethel
A. M. E. church, and is active in all
worthy or religious movements.
Mrs. Leila Walker Robinson, her
daughter, has charge of the Pitts
burgh branch of her business at 6258
Frankstown avenue, also at 108 West
13th street, New York City, N, Y.
Madam Walker met with some op
position in the form of doubt and in
difference, but being a woman with a
strong and determined will, she kept
her preparation before the public, and
soon the demand became so great that
she had to seek larger quarters; to
meet this demand she had erected a
large factory In the rear of her beau
tiful home on North West street. This
factory does a rushing business, both
local and foreign. Madam Walker, as
president of the corporation, contents
herself with acting in a supervisory
capacity, the immediate management
New York, August 23. A group of
prominent Negroes from Missouri
held a conference at Republican Na
tional Headquarters with Chairman
Willcox and Assistant Murray today
on political conditions existing among
the Negroes of tho West. They wtre
cordially received by tho chairman
and tho conversation extended over
a period of an hour, and each gentle
man .was asked to express his views
upon the situation as he saw it. In
the party were Prof. J. Silas Harris,
president of the National Educational
Congress; Lawyers L. A. Knox, Chas,
H. Calloway, George T. Wassora; Dr,
J. R. A. Crossland of St. Joseph, Mo.,
ex-ralnlster to Liberia, and Nelson C,

The Best Known Hair Culturist in America.
remedy for the growing of hair. Af
ter having tried it successfully on
herself and family, she decided to
make a business of it. July 19, 1905,
she left St Louis, Mo., for Denver,
Col., to engage In'the hair growing
business. After many discourage
ments and obstacles she finally was
able to convince the people at this
place that she could really grow hair,
and was successful in building up a
fair business. She remained in Den
ver a year. She became awakened
to tho needs of the colored people In
this line and her discovery was re
garded as one of the wonders of the
world. As sho had not thoroughly
convinced (the skeptical public in so
short a time she decided to travel,
notwithstanding she was discouraged
by many of her friends who said she
would not be able to make her ex
penses from one town to another.
However, she was determined and felt
inspired to do so. Believing, as Christ
converted tho world by miracles He
wrought before the Jews, by placing
her hand in His, she might convert
the world by tho wonderful good she
would do her people, on September
15, 1906, she started out to place her
goods on the market. She traveled
for a year and a half. At tho end of
that time the mail order business had
so Increased that it was necessary for
her to settle somewhere temporarily,
so Pittsburgh, Pa., was selected for
that purpose. After establishing a
business there, she left her daughter
in charge of the business there and
began traveling again. February 10,
1910, she came to Indianapolis, Ind.,
and was so impressed with the city
and tho cordial welcome extended to
her she decided to mako this city her
home. Since she has purchased and I
paid, for a beautiful home valued at
ten thousand ($10,000.00), adjoining
which is a factory and laboratory,
said to bo the most complete of Its
kind in tho United States. She has
12,000 agents. Her business Is Incor
porated with a capital stock of $10,
000.00, with an income of $1,000.00
per week, with Madam Walker as
president. Sho has made possible tho
way for many colored women to aban
don the wash-tub for mors pleasant
and profitable occupation. Since
coming to this city sho Is regarded
being under a forewoman, an estim
able and competent lady, Miss Alice
P. Kelly, from Louisville, Ky. There
are several girls employed, also book-
Keeper and stenographer.
It Is a treat to visit her laboratory,
see the girls at work, talk with Mad
am Walker, and get an idea of her
business. Madam Walker is now
making arrangements to send agents
to all parts of the country. Numerous
applications are in and are now under
consideration. The Raco feels proud
of this business woman, as well as
of the opportunity for employment
this corporation offers to her boys and
girls, and is proud of her for yet an
other reason, proud of her great big,
generous and race-loving heart, as at
tested by her gift of ono thousand
dollars to tho Colored Y. M. C. A.
building fund at Indianapolis, Ind.
Eleven years ago tho recipe for tho
wonderful preparation which ha
made Madame Walker tho wealthiest
and most envied woman of her race,
came in a dream and by her clear in
sight to the necessity of the needs of
tho women of her raco sho grasped
at this vision, promoting her ideas
until they became realities.
Beginning with $1.50 eleven years
ago, Madame Walker now has a busi
ness whose income Is $100,000 a year,
$250,000 in real estate and is break
ing ground for a new Sioo.nnn h
on the Hudson, which she expects to
have finished by the latter part of
next year. This Is to bo a summer
home, built on tho Italian Renaissance
style, and will be elegantly furnished
and artistically decorated.
Madame Walker has ko thnmnphlv
established her business until now the
name, Madame C. J. Walker's Hair
Grower, is all the recommendation
that the public asks.
