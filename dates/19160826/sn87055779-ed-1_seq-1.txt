When the young Pole was misled
a. few days after his disappearance
it was thought that he had left the
country. Friends. however, de
clared that they had not. seen him
come from the mine and it was
through their efforts a searching
party entered the mine Thursday.
The searchers were aln ist ready
to give up the task when the party
came upon the passageway which
had been unused for years and
found (Todowsky lying in the salt,

soon revived and rushed to the

held out hopes for his recovery.
