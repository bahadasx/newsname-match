Friend of Captain Spratling De
clares Atlantan's Wife Had
No Justification.
UNWRITTEN LAW DEFENSE
Mrs. Adams, in Prison, Asjerts
Militiaman Ruined Her.
Looks for Acquittal.
MACON, Qa.. Aug;. 2. "Just a case
of Jealousy," Is the way the killing of
Copt. Edgar J. Spratling, of Company
F, Fifth Georgia Infantry, by Mrs. II.
C. Adams, of Atlanta, Is described to
day by Mrs. Maud Monk, a trained
nurse and another woman In the
case.
Admitting friendly 'relations with
Captain Spratling for the last four
years, Mrs. Monk told Col. Orvllle
Hall, Spratling had shown her letters
fiom Mrs. Adams, In one of which she
stated if the captain did not bring her
to Jfacon and set her up in an apart
ment, she would come to Macon and
"put out his lights."
"From all I could gather there had
been nothing! wrong between them,"
Mrs. Monk said. "It looked like a plain
case of a woman's undue Infatuation
for a man she admired."
"Had No Defense."
In her cell fn the Jail Mrs. Adam
said today:
"He was my fumlly phyilclan and
took advantage of ine. If he had lived
ho would never have defended himself,
for ho had no defense. The only mis
take I made was that I did not tell my
husband sooner of my condition, but
nobody ever knows v. hat to do when
they aro In trouble.
"When all the testimony comes out I
think they will say I was Justified In
what I did and that I will be acquit
ted."
Mrs. Adams has been hysterical slnoe
being in Jail.
8. C. Adams, her husband, of Atlanta,
said today:
"God knows ray wife was Justified
in killing Spratling, for his crime
against her had preyed, upon her mind
as a horrible nightmare and. I -believed
had unbalanced It. "'
"Sho had threatened to me to kill him,
but I tried to dissuade her, telling her,
It was no use. I felt sure, the had de
cided to take my advice."
When told her three children were
alono In Atlanta, Mrs. Adams expressed
surprise and said she had promised a
neighbor anything she could give for
caring for them.
Call It Premeditated.
Officer's of the regiment assart the
killing was premeditated. Mrs. Adams
reached Macon about 10 o'clock Friday
morning, went straight to Camp Harrirs
and to Captain Spratllng's tent, directed
by a private, and shot him whllte at
mess before he had opportunity to say
anything.
"You ruined my life and I am going
to kill you," was all she said, drawing
the revolver and firing twice, once as he
fell, the latter bullet entering his mouth.
Captain Spratllng's body has been pre
pared for burial, and will be sent to
Atlanta Immediately following the cor
oner's inquest.
He will bo burled with mllltsfry honors
at Opellka. Ala., his birthplace.
Spratling was married. He was one
of the most popular officers In camp.

BAYLY THREATENS
SUIT FOR DIVORCE
Virginia Horseman Willing to
Free Chicago Heiress Only
on Desertion Charge.
WARRRNTON. Va.. Aug. SS.-Rogcr
Bayly, of Delaplane. Va.. the Virginia
horseman, who has been sued for di
vorce by Helen Morton Bayly, Chicago
heiress, threatens to niako n sensational
fight In the courts If his wife makes
any charge except desertion In her suit.
In a statement today llayly says he
has had evidence for a year that not
only would glvo him a divorce, but '
would bring some undesirable publicity.
Bayly said he would not dlvulgs this
evidence If his wife's divorce suit Is
based on grounds ot desertion alone.
Otherwise he promises a fight.
Tho divorce suit filed recently In Chi
cago marked the close of a runaway
romance, which attracted wide atten
tion because of the social prominence
of Miss Morton, heiress to the millions
of Mark Morton, and niece of the late
Paul Morton. Secretary of tho Knw In
Hgosevelfs Cabinet.
Miss Morton disappeared from her
home In Chicago In May, 1911, and was
married a month later to Bayly, a
prominent figure at horse shows In
Washington, Virginia, and New York.
A month after his marrlago Bayly
iiltd a petition In I)u Page county. II!..
asking that his wife be adjudged In
sane. A Jury of physicians placed her
undr the guardianship of Col. Gcorgo
Fabyan. ft friend of the family.
Since then the couple have been living
apart. The divorce suit by Mrs. llayly
was the next development.
Mr. Bagly made the following state
ment about the dtvorco proceedings:
"I went to Chicago In March and
'tu ocven or cigm weexs. I gavo
the Morton family, through their law-
yen, ine information mat I would not
ngm a sun ror divorce ir they used the
grounds of desertion only.
"On these grounds they have every
reason for divorce. They would take no
action whatever. I think their desire
was apparently to get us together again.
This -would never be so. I returned to
my home near Delaplane and through
my attorneys. Downing and Weaver, of
Front Royan. and J. Dona d Richards.
of Warrenton. I gave affadavlt that I
would sue Helen Morton on the evi
dence I have had for a year or more
which would undoubtedly give me the
divorce.
Filed Divorce Suit.
"The Mortons were notified of this
and the case was .set for the second
Monday In September. They then filed
suit In Chicago for divorce. This was
what appeared in all of the papers some
time ago.
"If they use the grounds of desertion
only I shall not fight the case, but If
they bring Into the case such evidence
as I learn they will then I shall proceed
on the grounds I have outlined."
Bayly made this stamenct when nt
the Warrenton horse show. He wished
to make It emphatic that he Is not try
ing to get anv money out ot tho di
vorce suit. He has disposed of his
hunters and snddle horses, and Is now
getting a racing stable while his young
stock Is growing. Early In the fall,
Bayly says, he In going to New Vork
to enter Into the brokerage business.

SENSATION IN WIFE'S
A Woman Suffrage Martyr
In' one of the prettiest and most prosperous towns in West Virginia a
woman, wife of the leading doctor, was found dead, her neck having been broken.
Her husband now is under arrest, charged with killing her. The dead woman
was an active worker for suffrage, and the husband was known to oppose her
views. She died just after her return home from making a suffrage speech,
and the authorities are proceeding on the theory that the husband in his anger
over her activity for the vote strangled her.
This is the bare outline of a tremendously interesting story of the strange
death of a woman whose whole life had been devoted to uplifting her community
and in working for the Interests of her fellows. The story will be told tomor
row in ' , .

"The battle of the Somme has now raged
for several weeks. Despite a tremendous use
of ammunition and repeated stores of human
material, the result of the general offensive
is now unimportant, when compared to the
great waste of physical and moral force. The
German front on the Somme stands un
shaken, despite the hardest forward and
backward fighting where the opposing
armies are locked in struggle like two stags.

GERMANY FACES NO CRISIS
By CARL W. ACKERMAN.
BTRAUBBBRG, Germany, Aug. 2. In
eight weeks of tremendous effort with
lavish expenditure of human flesh nnd
blood and ammunition, the allies not
only have failed to break the German
line on the Somme but have not even
badly bent It, General Alexander von
Kluck, who commanded the German
right In the great advance to the gates
of Pari, told the United Press today
at the beginning of the ninth week of
the allies' great offensive.
"In eight weeks of fighting they have
gained a few kilometers at terrible
losses." said the German war hero.
"The English have accomplished prac-
tlcally nothing. They have only ex
posed themselves to our counter-attack,
which will certainly come."

Before us was u map of the Homme

explained the positions held by his
army when he was In command on this
front before he was wounded.
The territory Uie allies are now try
ing to break through Is the same ground
across which von Kluck hurried with
his army during tho first advance Into
France In the fall of 19H. Aftor
twenty-two months of fighting, the bat
tle line at this point shows little
chango except that the Germans have
been pushed back a few kilometers.
"The English losses on the Somme
have been terrible," continued Gen
eral von Kluck. "They have been
much greater than ours. The English
had to put new men Into each attack.
Thrlr losseH must, exceed ours by at
least 100.000."
"Is that many ror tne large army
England la reported to have?" he was
asked.
"The decisive thing Is always to
hnv nlentv of men." he replied, "but
when there Is a great offensive like
this Anglo-French movement and lit
tle progress Is made; when the losses
are great and no progress Is evident,
the spirit of the troops weakens, and
that weakens the offensive."
"It Is reported abroad that Germany
is foclng a great military crisis, now
that the allies are attacking on sev

that It will not be long before she
will collapse." he was told.

Hours.
MANY VESSELS ARE SUNK
Time Limit for Naval Maneuv
ers Expires This Afternoon
and Action Is Intense.
A great naval "battle" has been rag
ing oft New York harbor for six hours.
Tho main battle fleet of Admiral
Helm, defending the coast, engaged the
attacking fleet of Admiral Mayo at 6
o'clock off Scotland lightship, at the
entrance to the harbor. Helm's fleet
opened fire with 12-Inch guns.
The sunken ships, under the rules of
the game, have put Into Atlantic porta.
Large bodies of theoretical wounded
have been rustled to naval hospitals,
and the hospital wards of both fleets at
sea are rapidly filling.
If the assumption that the enemyi bat
tleships were torpedoed Is correct,
naval officers here see great loss of
life.
The "enemy" transport train of thir
ty vessels Is reported to be lying back
of the attacking battle fleet waiting
for a chance to slip by the defending
lines and rush thousands of hostile
troops Inland,
Guns of all calibre aboard both fleets
are In action, and destroyer and sub
marine skirmishes are occurlng con

mander was maneuvering for position
to bring the greatest possible number
of guns to bear.
The Navy Department announced
that the battle limit expires at 6
o'clock this afternoon.
Eight war vessels, two battleships,
one scout cruiser, and Ave destroyers
have been sunk. The defending fleet
sunk the enemy battleships Texas and
Nevada and the enemy destroyers
Wadsworth and Cooper. Admiral Helm
has so far lost the scout cruiser Bir

It Is believed here that the enemy
battleships were destroyed early In

PRISONERSTiGHT
FIRE, THEN RETURN
Occoquan Convicts Save Town
From Flames Without At
tempt at Escape.
The honor system for penal Institutions
stood a remarkable test yesterday when
eighty prisoners left their confinement
at the District workhouse, fought for
three hours a Are that threatened to
wipe out the little town of Occuquan
and returned to the Institution, tired
and weary without making any effort
to escape.
Leo Beach, town sergeant of Occo
quan, said this morning that only the
valiant efforts of the workhouse Inmates
In their sombre convict suits of blue,
saved the historic old town from com
plete destruction.
Ralph Whlttaker. son of the superin
tendent of the Institution, was In town
when the fire was discovered In the old
Alton Hotel, occupied by Mrs. J, H.
Wecdon.
"I saw after fifteen minutes that the
fire was goln gto get away from the
bucket brigades," said young Whlttaker
this morning, "nnd I phoned up to the
workhouse and told them to hurry down
with our chemical engine, which was
formerly In the District fire department.
"About twenty prisoners arrived with
the chemical, which wns hauled down bv
au automobile. A few minutes later
they began bringing the men Into town
In every way they could,
"As soon as they arrived the prison
ers began working like Trojans. Not
only did they fight the flames, but
they brought nny amount of nroncrtv
from the buildings threatened by the
flames.
"Several of the prisoners were
slightly injured by ladders and in
other ways, but they kept on fight
ing." Young Whlttaker said tfio men made
no attempt to, take advantago of the
opj)ortunlty to secure their freedom.
Their whole attention seemed tn he
on tho work of checking the fire,
which did 140,000 damage before it
wns extinguished.
Only fifteen of the eighty prisoners
were white men.
The fire vesterdav was the first dis

WAGE DISPUTE
President In Few Hours - Wit)
Have Last Word of Execu

NATION ON VERGE OF STRIKE
"Peace or Walk-Out Will Be
Determined v Before
Ends' Says Willard.
Day
The showdown is at hand in the
railroad controversy.
Within a few hours the President
will have the last word of the rail
roads on the men's demands.
Railroad managers and men
were agreed today that the coun
try is on the verge of the greatest
railroad strike in history.
"Before the day is over the ques
tion of strike or peace will be set
tled," Daniel Willard, president of
the Baltimore and Ohio, said when
leaving a conference of the man
agers shortly afternoon.
The railroad executives at a
final conference, that was still in
session at 1 o'clock, were putting
the final touches to the counter
proposal which will be submitted
in a few hours to President Wil
son. MEN AWAIT SUMMONS.
Heads of the four railroad brother
hoods were In conference at the Nat
ional Hotel, awaiting a summon to the
White House to receive from the Presi
dent tne reply or tne railroads ex
ecutives to their demands.
At the same time the 640 railroad
workers' chairmen were In session at
the BIJou theater, planning to remain In
session continuously until the proposal
of the managers Is submitted to. them.
Scores of the railroad chairmen
paid their hotol bills today and pack
ed up preparatory to leaving Wash
ington. The consensus today was that if all
negotiations failed, the men would
delegate to the four brotherhood
leaders the authority to call a strike.
If a strike should be caled It was
Indicated that It will be several days
before It could go into effect.
President Wilson was said today to
be determined that the negotiations
should not be permitted to be broken
off at once If, as anticipated, the new
proposals of the railroad executives
and managers are rejected by the
brotherhood chiefs.
Put Men on Defensive.
Railroad executives said today they
had put the men on the defensive by
agreeing on new counter proposals
making arbitration the keynote.
When President Wilson submitted
his settlement proposals to the rail
roads and men the brotherhoods ac
cepted it. putting on the railroads the
blnme for any strike that might
eventuate.
"We have shifted responsibility to the
men, one railroad oniciai saiu toaay.
"Our proposal for arbitration will be
submitted to the President and by the
President to the rnllroau oromernooa
representatives.
"If they reject It the responsibility,
If a strike result, will be placed on the
men. They will bo In the position of
refusing to submit the dlsput to arbi
tration and Insisting on arbitrary action
without permitting impartial arbrltntois
to pass upon the entire controversy."
Sixty executives, called here n week
ago by President Wilson, have Ignored
his peace proposal and decided to sub
mit a substitute proposition, which
even the most optimistic feel the broth
erhoods will turn down.
It provides:
That an eight-hour day, Inasmuch
as theory practice on this question differ
widely, must not .be tried until after
arbitration and investigation.
That the question of wages, overtime
and other collateral details being by
their very nnture arbitrable, an Impar
tial board or commission should be
designated to pass on all of thee mat
ters. ,
That the roads will abide by the de
cision of such an Impartial body, .he
findings of the board or commission to
tako effect from the time arbitration
begins.
Ask No Increased Rates.
The roads In tho proposal now agreed
on among themselves rcquost no bene
ficlnl legislation and no Increased rates.
They suggest only that In tho event of
arbitration and Investigation of the
eight-hour working day an Impartial
commission do tho work.
The proposition Is less than 400 words
long. It Is the first concrete plan that
has been voted on nt any time by the
executives and It met with unanimous
approval.
It Is the only proposal that will come
from the roads, according to ono of the
leading executives today, and, he added,
"It is better than the brotherhood lead
era deserve. If they don't like It they
know what they can do."
With thlH action unanimously agreed
upon, the roads passed the question of
a strike or peace back to President
a striae or peace uhvk iu riuiu
Wilson and the brotherhoods, Ratifi
cation of the proposition was voted
by the executives and managers at
10 o'clock this morning.
The brotherhoods have Indicated
strongly they will not yield from their
original position In which they have
been supported by President Wilson
and will stand pat for an eight-hour
day with ten hours' pay.
There is still hope, but the general
Impression jptavalled that the last vis
