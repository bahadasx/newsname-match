usally bright. A sawmill has
been installed. The mine will be
operated by electricity, the cur
rent being furnished by the
Penn Public Service Co. of
of this city.

in Albany the other day:
"Our war profiters have the

command a war price here at

"A guest, beckoning this
waiter to him, said:
" 'See here, my son—this bill
here—"One lobster, $1.75, plus
one steak, SI." —that makes
$2.75, not $4.75, doesn't it?

al year State Health Commissioner Dr. Samuel G. Dixon issued
a sweeping, order in Harrisburg last night forbidding public and
private schools, academies and colleges, including Sunday schools,

Most of the colleges and academies begin the year about the third
week in September or later. Moving picture theaters which can
not pass drastic scrutiny of sanitary conditions will be compelled
to close their doors. Examination of the photo-play houses will
begin at once.

you have any bargains, w*hy
don't you put them in the paper
