iWILSON CONFERS
WITH UNION HEADS
Employers Holding Out for
Work Day as at Present
on Most of Roads
Washington, D. C., Aug. 25.—The
railway Btrike negotiations resolved
themselves today, outwardly at least,
into a more or less confused state.
Expressions of optimism from both
•ides were not so free as they were
jjresterday. and feeling heretofore gen
'eral among the managers that a plan
to include the eight hour day would be
found was not so evident. Some of the
[railway executives reverted to their
prediction that it never would be con
1ceded.
President Wilson today conferred
(with
the four brotherhood heads. All
parties to the conference steadfastly
refused to say what was talked about.
The railroad executives conferred
among themselves during'the day and
it was thought possible they might lat
er go to the white house.
Some of the mora optimistic still
had hopes of a final decision being
reached before tomorrow night.
The executives and managers devot
ed practically no time today to con
sideration of freight rate increases or
settlement of strikes but conferred on
the length of the working day and pay.
Brotherhood'TieadS declared they
were standing on President Wilson's
plan and had not changed their atti
tude a particle.
As the conferences among the rail
road executives progressed it was said
the presidents were standing more
closely together for arbitration than at
any time since they had assembled
here.
It was indicated that the commnuicar
tion being prepared for President Wit
son wpuld contain a further Insistence
on arbitration.
Late this afternoon Presidents Lov
ett, Holden and Willard of the Union
Pacific, Burlington and Baltimore &
Ohio, respectively, went to the white
house. It was understood they would
outline to President Wilson the con
clusion of the select committee of ex
ecutives so far.
Objections Are Raised.
Railway presidents today were con
fronted with a number of objections
to their tentative plan for meeting the
union brothehoods' demands by grant
ing the eight hour day on condition
that freight rate increases and public
investigation of future wage disputes
be assured. They arranged another
meeting shortly before noon to con
sider their special committee's pro
posal and it appeared possible that a
final conclusion would be postponed
until net week.
These conditions weighed against
the chances of a rate increase:
There is no means of assuring what
action the interstate commerce com
mission might take, particularly inas
much as previously it has indicated
unwillingness to consider wage stan
dards in dealing with proposed rate
Increases strong influence of big
•kippers probably would be thrown
against higher rates President Wil
son's stand for an increase would
amount to little if he should fail of re
election regardless of other hazards,
new rates could not be put into effect
before next March.
The greatest element of uncertainty
regarding the proposed legislation for
creating a federal body to investigate
labor demands before a Strike might
be allowed was the probable hostility
of labor leaders to the plan.
Continued hostility of many presi
dents to the eight hour day under any
circumstances complicated the situa
tion further,
MANUFACTURERS PROTEST.
Chicago, Aug. 25. —Manufacturers
and industrial organizations from all
industrial sections of the country will
meet here next Tuesday to protest
against surrender of the arbitration
principle in negotiations between rail

association, was sent today throughout

APart of the industries with reference
to the controversy between the rail

facturers and public wIlT be seriously

BATTLE 11
SEA EXPECTED TO
NAVAL WAR GAME HAS REACHED
8TAGE WHERE INVADERS
ARE AT THE COAST.
Washington, D. C., Aug. 25.—Nary
officers today looked for news that a
battle had occurred between the two
fleets participating in a war game on

being hurried to land from Rear Ad
miral Helm's "blue" defending fleet,

believe that the Intercepted message
picked up yesterday saying the invad
ing transports had been sighted was a
decoy sent out by Admiral Helm, com
manding the defenders, In hope of
misleading Admiral Mayo.
Admiral Helm has called for ammu
nition, Including torpedoes and sup
plies, to be delivered within a given
time from the various stations and de
pots along the Atlantic coast.
At the conclusion of the war game

Dr. J. E. Hull in Statement
on Infantile Paralysis
Finds No Danger Here
MEDICAL SCIENCE
DOESN'T KNOW CAUSE
City Physician Holds That
Doctors Have Not Found
Poliemyelitis Germ
Because of the wide spread of in
fantile paralysis in New York and the
east, and the publicity given the epi
demic by means of press dispatches
all over the country, people in this
section of the country have viewed
with alarm the ravages of the dread
disease and the prjess throughout the
country has noted local cases wher
ever they have appeared. Believing
that the public or a large portion of it
has become frightened and thinks an
epidemic is possible here, City Physi
cian J. E. Hull has prepared a state
ment on Infantile paralysis and
No More Than Before.
I have no desire to minimize this
dread disease as in almost every case
there results some permanent paraly
sis if the case is not fatal and the
great majority of cases are not. The
reports of cases back in New York
this year have shown a mortality of
about 20 per cent. But what I would
like to Impress upon all is that there
is no more infantile paralysis in Iowa
this year than in previous years. Four
cases have been reported in Wapello
county, which is not more than is usu
al except previous to this year and
owing to the great epidemic back east,
the cases were not reported or quar
antined here.

Bays
there is no danger nor any reason to
fear epidemic here as only one case
has been found in Ottumwa and but
four in the county. The city physi
cian's statement follows:
The press of this and other cities
has said so much and created so much
alarm about the appearance in our
midst of poliomyelitis, or as it is bet
ter known, infantile paralysis, that it
seems to me not out of place to at
tempt to allay the fears of the public
with regard to this disease.
Many children have been refused
admission to state institutions from
Ottumwa and many people have been
afraid to come to the city to visit or
do shopping on account of the articles
appearing frequently in the papers with
regard to this disease. One day a case
is reported, the next day something is
said about the progress of the case.
The following day no new case has
been reported andhthe next day County
Auditor Blsaell has pamphlets for free
distribution, describing the disease
and instructing how to prevent it, etc.,
ditto and repeat until the one case is
exaggerated in the minds of the people
and they Imagine that there is a real
epldemlo of Infantile paralysis in our
midst
possible to end the uncertainty
of the present situation, is "earnestly
requested" of the mother country. The
resolutions were cabled to the finance
minister of Denmark at Copenhagen.
