Both Sides Consider Hope of
Peaceable Settlement All
But Gone
By Carl D. Groat.
United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Aug. 2(1. "We are
rendy."
This statement came today from both
railroad executives and employes, as a
national transportation paralysis loom
ed up. linilroud managers contended
that they could keep sufficient trains
running through "loyal employes" to
jirevent a milk and food famine and
its consequent garnering of death and
desolation.
The employes said there might be a
few rendy to continue laboring, but
that the roads as a whole would be tied
up tighter than a drum.
In the railroad camp, the grimmest
fighters snid "put white lead ou the en
gines and lay everything off."
The most conservative said "we must
see that the babies have their milk and
the nation its food."
Down the street, the employes snid
the guilt for ruin or starvation would
lie upon the railroad kings.
It developed today that while the rail
road presidents have been wrestling
with the problem of meeting President '
Wilson's proposal, the managers, some
what side tracked from the phase of
the situation, have been working out
plans for handling an actual strike if it
comes. .
A comprehensive plan is complete,
they now declare. It includes details of
train operation. Emergency schedules
have been made and it is known that
wince the beginning of the negotiations,
embargoes on some commodities hava
been considered. One railroad official!
raid that imemdiately upon declaration !
of a strike, embargoes would be placed
on war munitions and drygoods and non
perishable commodities not regarded as
necessities.
The first thought of the roads will
be to carry foodstuffs.
A reason for the extensive strike
plans, one executive said, is the roads
feeling that all the brotherhoods mem
bers are not behind a strike movement.
"Our fight is with the lenders," he
aid. "I know my men are loyal to
me. I have worked with them and talk
ed to them and I know they like me.
But we must prepare against any
thing." One great railroad eystem has pre
pared thousands of circular letters, tn
be mailed to employes within an hour
after a strike is declared. The letters
tell the roads' tide of the ease and ask
support.
Significance was seen today in the
fact that many of the 640 railroad
brotherhood representatives were pre
paring to leave 'Washington. Several
paid their hotel bills and arranged to
take night trains.

ALLIED OFFENSIVE
IS DISMAL FAILURE
The allies' great offensive on the
Somme developing into one of. the
greatest battles in the world V history,
began the morning of July 1, exactly
eight months ago today. From General
Alexander von Kluck, one of Germany's
greatest leaders in the early days of the
war, who was compelled to retire be
cause of wounds, the United Tress has
obtained .the German view of the results
of the eight weeks of fighting. Includ

the. Somme district where the allied of
fensive has been under way.
GENERAL VON KLTJCK'S VIEWS
By Carl W. Ackermaiu
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Strausberg, Germany, Aug. 26. In
eight weeks of tremendous effort with
lavish expenditure of human flesh and
blood anil ammunition, the allies not
only nave failed to break the German
line on the Somme but have not even
badly bent it, General Alexander Von
Kluck, who commanded the German
right in the great advance to the gates
of Furis, told the United Press to
day. Gains Are Small.
"In eight weeks of fighting they
have gained a few kilometers at terrible
losses," said the German war hero.
"The" English have accomplished prac
tically nothing. They have only exposed
themselves to our counter attacks,
which will certainly come."
We were seated in the. smoking room
of Wilkendorf castle, near Strausberg.
Before us was a map of the Somme bat
tle lino. General Von Kluck first ex
plained the position held by his army
when he was in command on this front
beforo he was wounded. The territory
the allies arc now trying to break
through is the same ground across which
Von Kluck hurried with his nrmy dur
ing the first advance into France in
the fall of 1914. After 22 months of
fiehtine. the battle line at this front
shows little change except that the Ger-
mans have been pushed back a few kilo
meters.
" Losses Very Severe.
"The English losses on the Somme
have been terrible," continued General
Von Kluck. "They have been much
greater than ours. The English had to
put new men into each attack. Their
losses must exceed ours bv at least
100,000."
"Is that many for the large army
England is reported to havet" he was
asked.
"The decisive thing Is always to have
plenty of men," he replied, "'but when
there is a great offensive like this
Anglo-French movement and little pro
gress is made; when the losses are great
and no progress is evident, the spirit of
the troops weakens and that weakeas
the offensive."
"It is reported abroad that Germany
is facing a great militnry crisis now
that the allies are attacking on several
fronts and it Is even rumored that it
will not be long before she will col
lapse," he was told.
No Crista in Germany.

of Captain Edgar J. Spratling, one of
tne most prominent physicians in At

state mobilization camp here.
"He was my family physicHin and
he took advantage of me," said Mrs.
Adams, who arose in the Bibb county
jnil refreshed by a good night's sleep.
"I made but one mistake, that was
that I did not tell my husband before
of what the doctor had done to me.
I had gone to Dr.- Spratling for treat
ment for nervous trouble. He made
improper advances to me and seemed
to hypnotize me. After it was over
I could not sleep at night because the
thing wns on my mind.
"I told my husbnnd last Friday. He
walked the floor like a crazy man.
There was ouly one thing for me to do
and that wns to kill this man ho had
ruined my life. I don't believe any
jury will convict me of murder."
The woman's husband, an Atlanta
laundryman, is en route to Macon to
make arrangements for her defense. He
had no idea that his wife had come
to Macon on such a mission, though
she had threatened to kill Spratling.

is no crisis," the general laughingly
replied. "Eight weeks have passed
since thoAnglo-Frcnch offensive began.
The preparations for it must be called
immense. England brought armies that
might never have been expected of that
country, thanks to Kitchener's labor
and it was Kitchener's labor. France,
despite her serious losses at Verdun,
had put the last reserves of her 30
fighting years (meaning 30 classes) to
gether. The industries of France, Eng
land, the United States and Japan
worked feverishly to supply the allied
armies with tremendous amounts of war
material for 'a general offensive on all
fronts.'
"The moment of the attack seemed
well chosen because Germany, during
the weeks before, was supposed to be
suffering under shortage caused by the
blockade. Before the possibility of a
splendid harvest became known to the
allies, they became convinced that only
a great military success was needed to
bring the wavering spirit of Germany
wavering as they supposed to her
knees.
"The bnttle of the Somme has now
raged for several weeks. Despite a tre
mendous use of ammunition and re
peated stores of humun material, the
result of the general offensive is now
unimportant when compared to the
great waste of physical and moral force.
The German front ou the Somme stands
unshaken, despite the hardest forward
and backward fighting, where the op
posing armies are locked in a struggle
like twestngs.
. French Change Tune.
"A change has taken place in the for
mer victorious tone of the French press
of a few weeks ago. The French news
papers now exhort their readers to be
patient and not ask too much.
"On the front of the German army
and throughout the country confidence
and belief in victory grows. A United
Press dispatch from Verdun spoke of
the moral power of the German troops.
This is the same on all floats and it is
this spiritual force, as every atrategian
knows, that is the decisive thing that
will end the present struggle."
The conversation turned toward Field
Marshal French, who was Von Kluck 'a
opponcut in the battle of Mous. I be
gan to make notes of the general 'a re
marks. .
"Please don't write that," he said,
"During the war we muat not talk of
our opponents. It is always best to
speak well, even of your opponents but
there are many things about the story
of this war that, conclusively written,
would constitute a whole library."
" How long do you think the war will
last!" was one question I put to the
general.
Peace Will Come Suddenly.
"It can last years or days," was his
reply. "The end of the waiwill come
as suddenly as an accident. A Swiss
newspaper sized up the situation cor
rectly recently wheu it Bnid: 'Europe
lacks courage for peace."
General Von Kluck is now 70 years
old. But despite the fact that he has
been wounded seven times, and still
carries a bullet in his right arm, he is
ready to go back to the front if neces
sary, he said.
Spratling wns prominent in medical
and social circles in Atlanta and was
regarded as an expert on nervous dis
eases and insanity. He wns married

HARD ON HIS TRIP
Tf
Concludes First Lap of Pres
ent Campaign Trip In Good
Spirits and Health
By Perry Arnold.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Denver, Colo., Aug. 2o. With three
speeches in Colorado today, Nominee
Hughes concluded the first lap of his
campaign tour and was to leave tonight
for a three day rest period at Estes
Park. Up to today the republican can
didate has campaigned through 13
states, being almost continuously in
what have been declared by local lead
ers to be republican states, except pos
sibly California ami Illinois. He has
made more than a "hundred speeches and
arrived at Denver today very tired
physically although well and exceed
ingly anxious for a complete rest iu
the seclusion of the mountains. But he
was very sanguine of success when the
ballots are cast by the people whom he
has addressed.
"We have bad a remarkable trip
across the continent," was the way
Hughes described hi journey so far.
"Everywhere there has been evidence
of a very deep interest in th issues of
this campaign. I do not attribute this
to my personal relation to the campaign,
but to the deep interest that is taken
by the American people in the great
question involved. . As I go through the
country I am constantly impressed with
the extraordinary resources that we
have for our development and for our
permanent prosperity.
"Best of all is the fine manhood
and womanhood that ia utilizing these
resources. We find patriotism and un
swerving loyalty that characterizes the
people throughout the length and
breadth of the land. Every day on
this trip is the best day.
"I have been several times across the
continent and I know something of the
various communities composing our
country, but to go through in this rapid
way, receiving , generous welcomes,
makes an appeal to the heart of a
man." ,
Throughout this trip to date, Hughes
has steadfastly maintained his position
of aloofness from state and local issues
! or factional differences. It is known
that ia California and Utah every ef
fort was made to have him make some
expression of his views on prohibition
the dry issue being a particularly
acute one in those two commonwelaths.
In California the republican candidate
emphasized the reunion of the party but
did his best to avert any favoritism of
either the regulars or progressives half
A course, which nevertheless, accord
ing to such a progressive leader as
Chester Howell, created considerable
dissatisfaction among progressives since
arrangments for Hughes' tour of the
state was in the control of "regulars."
Despite his physical tiredness, Hughes
is in splendid fighting from today.
He has had big audiences everywhere
and no matter bow tired he has been
stimulated by these audiences into mak
ing punchy speeches all along the line
even though these speeches have been
largely identical.
It is rather remarkable that a public
speaker, who for six years has kept his
voice bottled up, has managed to bring
it back so that not a single place which
he has visited so far has the audience
had any difficulty in understanding
him.
Dr. N. E. Dittman, who has accom
panied the governor on his trip and
done heroic work taking the huskiness
out of the nominee's voice and other
wise keeping him in fine physical fet
tle, announced today he would let the
governor take care of himself from
Kansas City on eastward, believing he
didn 't need any further throat spray
ing. Mrs. Hughes will then have full
charge of the nominee.
Today Hughes was hustled out to
make a brief speech at Greeley, en
route from Cheyenne to Denver. He
was due to arrive at Denver shortly
before noon, and to parade the streets
to the hotel. He was scheduled for a
brief talk at a luncheon of the Mile
High club, a public reception at the
Brown Palace hotel and a night meeting
ana a "Dig speech" at the audtionura.
At 11 o'clock he was due to leave for
Estes Park, for his rest.
Specking at Greeley, Colo., earlv to
day, Governor Hughes assailed the
democrats in the following phraseol
ogy: "Our opponents said that they would
reduce the cost of living. They haven 't.
They said that they would stand for
the merit system. They have shameless
ly betrayed the merit system. They
said that they were for maintenance of
constitutional rights of American citi
zens throughout the world. They left
our citizens to be murdered and their
property destroyed right here in Mex
ico, close to our own boundary. They
said they were opposed to a tariff for
protection. This they carried out, with
the result that before the Euroeau
war broke out, unemployed men were
walking the streets of our cities, job
less, asking for work and having to be
fed bv countless charitable organiza
tions." Dig Yourself In.
"Be sure you're right then go ahead."
We have a notion that
It's somtimes wiser to be sure

There was a lull In the celebration

of the line of parade was jammed, and
a crowd not of less than twenty-five

Eugene Radiators, with sixty boy drum
corps, Portland Rosarians, Salem Cher

DEFENDING FLEET
Theatrical Naval Battle of
New York Harbor Victory
For Invaders
Washington, Aug. 20. Ad
miral Helm's defending fleet
has been destroyed by the "en
emy" aud troops are now be
lieved to be landing on Long
Island (theoretically) in the big
naval game of the Atlantic
squadron.
Washington, Aug. 20. A great naval
"battle" has been raging off New
York harbor for nix hours.
The main battle fleet of Admiral 1
Helm defending the coast engaged the
attacking fleet of Admiral Mayo at S
o'clock off Scfttlanff lightship, at the
entrance to New York harbor. Helm's
fleet opened fire with 12 inch guns.
Eight war vessels, two Datuesnips,
one scout cruiser and five destroyers
have already been "sunk" in the naval
war game. The defending fleet sank
the "enemy" battleships Texas and
Nevada and the "enemy" destroyers
Wadsworth and Cooper. Admiral Helm
has so far "lost' the scout cruiser Bir
mingham and the destroyers Fanning,
Drayton and Balch.
It is believed here that the "enemy"
battleships were "destroyed" early In
the fight by torpedoes from the de
stroyers of the defending fleet.
The sunken ships, under the rules of
the game, have to put into Atlantic
ports. Large bodies of theoretical
wounded have been rushed to naval
hospitals aud the hospital wards of
botn fleets at sea are rapidly fill
ing. if the assumption that the enemy bat
tleships were torpedoed is correct, nnval
officers here see great "loss of liie"
for those two vessels.
The "oucmy" transport train of 30
vessels is reported to be lying back of
the attacking fleet waiting for a chance
to ship by tne defending lines and rush
thousands of hostile troops inland. Guns
of ull calibre aboard both fleets are
in action and destroyer and submarine
skirmishes are occurring constantly. As
Inst reported, each commander was
muuuevering tor position to bring tho
greutest possible number of guns to
bear.
The navy department announced that
the buttle limit expires at S o'clock this
afternoon,
"Allen Forces" Have Landed.
Washington, Aug. 20. "Alien
forces" this afternoon affected a suc
cessful landing ou Long Island.
The fleet defending the American
coast has been decisively defeated, the
oretically, and the greutest war game
in the United States naval history is
ended.
The following radiogran was receiv
ed this afternoon from Admiral Knight,
chief umpire:
"The maneuver is over. Reds have
accomplished their mission."
This means that the transports made
a landing.

Bremen, Aug. 20. The German -submarine
Dcutschlnnd made her 8,200
mile journey to the United States and

she was blackened aft by the smoky
exhaust from her engines. She made
her way to Bremen under her own

fortified positions and threatening the
capture of Thiepval, which has inter
fered with General Haig's advance
since the Somme battle began.
The new British gain reported by
General Haig was made near Mouquet
