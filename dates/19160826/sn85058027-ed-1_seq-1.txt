About twenty-five men nro now

erected on Dutchman Flat. All tho

and all tho nvallablo carpenters nro
being put to work.
It Is expected that the mill will bo
ready to commenco turning out con.
ccntratcs by November 1st. Tho tun.
chlnory, excepting one car load is
already on the ground and this car is
duo to arrive from Denver any dny.
Thoio will now be no delny till tho
plant is completed.
Tho mill will hnvo a capacity of 0G
tons dally and Is being so constructed
thnt additional units may bo ndded,
increasing Its capacity." On the Pa.
clflc dump there Is already sufficient
ore to keep tho mill going for one year
and tho big vein Is said to have suffi
cient mill oro oxposed to keep a plant
of this capacity going for 10 yen is
longer.
Tho Pacific Is a sulphide oro and In
Ideal for concentrating. Very little
power will bo necessary for crushing.
Tests mado on tho oro show that It
will reduce down nbout -1 to 1 and
then produco n shipping grado worth
nbout $G0 per ton, which means a pro.
diictlon or about 10 tons or concen
tmtos dally. This will also mnko lh,
extraction of high grade moro con.

an oio body carrying lend, silver and
a little copper, the total vuluos being
about $25 per ton, nnd thnt whllo tho

shot.
Hut tills is not the only good report
from tho mine. In limiting n rnlso from
tho tunnel to a shaft sunk from the

be a bedded vein nnd which has far

In order to afford nulck and efllelent

Since tho talk of moving tho build

specially sultnblo for post offlco pur.
Posob with a flood of light could bo
erected If a long tlmo leaso woro

Just Like a Gold Bond m
B A good cattle barn begins to earn money for you from the n
I day it is completed. And the returns keep coming in year 9
after yen without interruption. jH
Look at the building shown in the picture. It is one good 99
suggestion fur a profit-ca"rning cattle barn. You will sec from in
the illustration that it is designed for a good sized herd and it Sjfl
I has plenty of roomfor hay overhead. ' &m
Notice, also, the shelter shed, arranged by an extension of fflk
the main roof. The cattle appreciate this protection from the Wm
weather. When the cattle gain in weight, you gain in money. fgj
Let us help you with your"plans for a new cattle barn. 19
