STRAUSBERG, Germany, Aug. 26.
—In eight weeks of tremendous effort
with lavish expenditure of human
flesh and blood and ammunition, the
amps not only have failed to break
the German line on the Somme, but
have not even badly bent it, General
Alexander Von Kluck, who command
ed the German right in the great ad
vance to the gates of Paris, told the
United Press today.
"In eight weeks of fighting they
have gained a few kilometers at ter
rible losses," said the German war
hero. "The English have accomplish
ed practically nothing. They have
only exposed themselves to our coun
ter attacks, which will certainly
come."
We were seated in the smoking
room of Wilkendorf castle near
Strausberg. Before us was a map of
the Somme battle line. General Von
Kluck first explained the positions
held by his army when he was in
command on this front before he was
wounded. The territory the allies are
pow trying to break through is the
same ground across .which Von Kluck
hurried with his army during the first
advance into France in the fall of
1914. After twenty-two months of
fighting, the battle line at this point
shows little change except that the
Germans have been pushed back a
few kilometers.
"The English fosses on the Somme
have been terrible," continued Gen
eral Von Kluck. "They Lave been
much greater than ours. The Eng
lish had to put new men into each
attack. Their losftes must exceed ours
by at least $100,000."
"Is that many for the large army
England is reported to have?" he
was asked.
"The decisive thing is always to
have plenty of men," he replied^ "but
when there is a great offensive like
this Anglo-French movement and
little progress made when the
losses are great and no progress is
evident, the Bpirit of the troops weak
ens and that weakens the offensive."
"it is reported abroad that Germany
is facing a great military crisis now
that the allies are attacking on sever
al fronts and it is even rumored that
it will not be long before she will
collapse," he was told.
"You can see for yourself that there
is no crisis," the general laughingly
replied. "Bight weeks have passed
since the Anglo-French offensive be
gan. The preparations for it must be
called immense. England brought
armies that might never have been
expected of that country, thanks to
Kitchener's labor—and it was Kitch
ener's labor. Flrance, despite her ser
ious losses at Verdun, had put the last
reserves of her thirty fighting years
(meaning thirty classes) together.
The industries of France, England,,
the United States and Japan worked
feverishly to supply the allied armies

DENVER, Colo., Aug. 26.—With
three speeches in Colorado today,
Nominee Hughes concluded the first
lap of his campaign touring and was
to leave tonight for a three day rest
period at Estes Park. Up to today,
the republican candidate has cam
paigned through thirteen s'ates, being
almost continuously in what have
been declared by local leaders to be
republican states, except possibly
California and Illinois. He has made
more than a hundred speeches and
arrived at Denver today very tired
physically, although well and exceed
ingly anxious for a complete rest in
the seclusion of the mountains. But
he was very sanguine of success when
the ballots are cast by the people
whom he has addressed. A
"We have had a remarkable trip
across the continent," was the way
Hughes described his Journey so far.
"Everywhere there has been evidence
of a very deep interest in the issues
of this campaign. I do not attribute
this to my personal relation to' tbe
campaign, but to the deep^ interest
that is takehby the Ameridak-people
in the great questions Involved. As
I go through the country am con
stantly Impressed with the.iextraordi
nary resources we have for our de
velopment and for our ermanent
prosperity. Best of all is the fine
manhood and womanhood that is
utilizing these resources. We find
patriotism and unswerving loyalty
that characterizes the people through
out the length and breadth of the
land. Evtfry day on this trip is the
best day.
"I have been several times across
the continent and I know something
of the various communities compos
ing our country, but to go through
in this rapid way, receiving generous
welcomes, makes an appeal to the
heart of a man."
Throughout this trip tgr date,
Hughes has steadfastly maintained
his position of aloofness from state
and local Issues or factional differ
ences. It is known that In California
and Utah every effort was made to
have him make some expression of
his views on prohibition—the dry is
sue being a particularly acute one in
these two communities. In California
the republican candidate emphasized
the reunion of the party, but did his
best to avert any favoritism of, either
the regulars or progressives' half—a
course which, nevertheless, According
to such a progressive leader as Ches
ter H. Rowell, created considerable
dissatisfaction among progressives
since arrangement for Hughes' tour
of the state was in the control of "reg
ulars."
Despite his physical tiredness.
Hughes is in splendid fighting form
today.
He has had big audiences every
where and no matter how tired, he
has been stimulated by these aud
iences into making "punchy" speeches
all along the line even though these
speeches have been largely identical.
It is rather remarkable that a pub
lic speaker who for six years has kept
his voice bottled up. has managed to
bring it back so that at not a single
place which he has visited so far
has the audience had any difficulty

BARALONGS IN TRENCH
Called the Most Cowardly and Flag
rant Violation of Laws so
Far During the
War.
BBRUN (via wireless to Sayville),:
Aug. 26.—Charges that the French
have introduced a new body of men
whose sole duty is to assassinate all
living German soldiers in conquered
trenches with knives, revolvers and
hand grenades, were made in a state-1
ment given out by the semi-official
new« agency today.
The statement was headed "Bara
longs of the trenches" recalling the
killing of German submariners by the
crew of the British ship Baralong.
"The French some time ago Introduced
a new fighting system which is the
most cowardly and flagrant violation
of the laws known up to the present,''
it was stated. "Within French com
panies, special detachments are form
ed with the express order to remain
in conquered trenches and kill all
Germans still alive.
"These troops are called nettoy
eurs.' Their equipment is not the
rifle, cartridges and bffyonet of the
other soldiers, but the revolver, knife
and hand grenade. When a French
storming column succeeds in taking a
trench, the nettoyeurs start clearing
the trench of all living persons—that
is assassinating the Germans. Hand
grenades are thrown into the dugouts
.where often there are wounded. Those
who escape the grenades are killed by
revolver shots and knives when they
attempt to come out. This terrible
slaughter is continuing from man to
man. Every man, whether wounded
or not, is mercilessly stabbed or shot."

WASHINGTON, Aug. 26 —A great
naval "battle" has been raging off
New York harbor for six hours.
The main battle fleet of Admiral
Helm, defending the coast, engaged
the attacking fleet of Admiral Mayo
at five o'clock off Scotland Lightship
at the entrance to the New York
harbor. Helm's flet opened fire with
12-inch guns.
Eight war vessels, two battle ships,
one scout cruiser and five destroyers
have already been "sunk. The de
fending fleet sunk the enmy battle
ship Texas and Nevada and the
enemy destroyers Wadsworth and
"lost"r'the scout CTUISCT pfrmi'ngham
and th^destuyere Fanning^
The sunken ships, under the rules
of the game, have to put into Atlan
tic ports. Large bodies of theoreti
cal wounded have been rushed to
naval hospitals and the hospital
wards of both fleets at sea are rapidly
filling.
If the assumption that the enemy
battleships were torpedoed is correct,
naval officers here see great loss of
life for those two vessels.
"The enemy" transport train of
thirty vessels is reported to be lying
back of the attacking battle fleet wait
ing for a chance to slip by the de
fending lines and rush thousands of
hostile troops inland. Guns of all
calibre aboard both fleets are in ac
tion and destroyer and submarine
skirmishes are occurring constantly.
As last reported, each commander
was maneuvering for position to bring
the greatest possible number of guns
to bear.
The navy department announced
that the battle limit expires at five
o'clock this afternoon.

EMERGENCY SCHEDULES
Roads Would Only Carry Necessities
and Think They Can Get

Trains.
[By Carl D. Groat, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Aug. 26.—"We are
ready."
This statement came today from
both railroad executives and em
ployes, as a national transportation
paralysis loomed up. Railroad mana
gers contended they could keep ituffl
cient trains running through "loya!
employes" to prevent a milk and food
famine—and its consequent garnering
of death and desolation.
The employes said there might be a
few ready to continue laboring, but
that the roads as a whole would be
tied up tighter than a drum.
In the railroad camp, tho grimmest
fighters said "put white lead on the
engines and lay everything off." The
most conservative said, "We must see
that the babies have the'r milk and
the nation its food."
Down the street the employes said
the guilt for ruin or starvation would
lie upon the railroad kings.
It developed todaytbat while the
railroad aresidents have been wrest
ling with the problem of meeting
President Wilson's proposal, the man
agers, somewhat sidetracked from the
phase of the situation, have been
working out plans for handling an
actual strike if it comes.
A comprehensive plan is complete,
they now declare. PlanB include de
tails of train operation. Emergency
schedules have been made and it is
known that since the 'beginning of
the negotiations, embargoes on some
commodities have been considered.
One railroad official said that imme
diately upon declaration of a strike,
embargoes would be placed on war
munitions and dry goods and imper
ishable commodities not legarded as
necessities.
The first thought of the roads will
be to carry food stuffs.

The beginning of the ninth week of
the great Anglo-French offensive on
the Somme, saw the British line at
this point steadily encircling the Ger
man fortified positions and threaten

has interfered with General Haig's
advance since the Somme battle be

The new British gain reported by
General Haig, was made near Mou
