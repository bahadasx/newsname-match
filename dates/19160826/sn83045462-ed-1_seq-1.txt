PARTS, August 26.?The Bulgarians
have attacked and captured the Greek

rison, which offered spirited resistance,
says a Saloniki dispatch to the Matin.
The dispatch is dated August 23 and
was delayed.
The British and Bulgarians have been
in touch on the Macedonian front north
east of Saloniki. British troops, despite
the Bulgarian fire, destroyed three
bridges over the Angista in the vicinity
of Kuchuk. the war office announced.
Serbs in Heavy Fighting.
Although reports from Saloniki say
the Serbians have made appreciable
progress on the left wing of the Salon
iki front and h?.ve taken several
hundred prisoners. Sofia declares that
after severe fighting the Serbians have
been defeated with very heavy losses
and compelled to rellire. Eighteen con
secutive attacks were made by the
Serbians, it is declared.
On the eastern end of the front Bul
garian forces have reached the Greek
Aegean coast and put British cavalry de
tachments to flight, Sofia also declares.
Several villages have been occupied by
the Bulgarians.
Italians at Porto Palermo.
A dispatch from Avlona states that
the Italians have occupied Porto Pa
lermo and the summit of Mount Kala
rat. in southern Albania, in order to
watch the Albanian coast north of
Cape Kephali, fifty miles southeast of
Avlona, in which district there is said
to be an Austrian submarine base.
The territory occupied by the Ital
ians is quasi-Greek. The opinion of
Rome newspapers, however, is that
Greece will not protest the occupation.
The landing of Italian troops at Salo
niki has now been completed, and the
transports which brought the men have
returned to Italy.
Rumanian King Refuses.
According to information from diplo
matic sources, says a wireless dispatch
from Bern, Emperor William of Ger
many wrote to King Ferdinand of Ru
mania that he intended to send Duke
Albrecht of Mecklenburg on a special
mission to him with regard to the po
sition of Rumania.
King Ferdinand replied, adds the dis
patch, that the mission would be in
opportune, because as a constitutional
monarch he would be obliged to refer
the envoy to his ministers, and in the
circumstances he preferred that any
communication from the German gov- I
ernment should be received through
ordinary diplomatic channels.

TURKISH CAMPAIGN
DEALT HARD GLOW
Attempt to Encircle Russian
Left Flank in Caucasus
Proves Futile.
MOVEMENT NEARLY
SUCCEEDED, HOWEVER
Aimed to Regain Erzerom and Thus
Nullify Grand Duke's Arme
nian Successes.
RETROORAD. August 26?The Turk
ish attempt to encircle the left flank of
the Russian Caucasian army appears to
have reoeived a crushing blow from the
troops of Grand Duke Nicholas in the
region of Lake Van. The Turkish en
circling scheme aimed at regaining: Er
zerum and thus nullifying all the grand
duke's victories in Turkish Armenia ap
peared about to succeed, but the Russian
reoccupation of Mush and Bitlis and re
establishment of Russian positions west
of Lake Van apparently has made hope
less the Turkish efforts.
The initiative now appears again to be
with the Russians at all important points
in Asia Minor, and now that the Turkish
offensive on the left flank has been stop
ped Grand Duke Nicholas can continue
his march toward Asia Minor.
Turks in Majority.
The task of turning the Russian left
flank in southern Armenia and western
Persia was intrusted to the Mush group
of the Turkish forces, which, reinforced
by troops from every part of Euro
pean and Asiatic Turkey until they far
outnumbered the Russian army opposing
them, began the northeastern drive in the
direction of Erzerum. Although constantly
halted by the Russian fire and forced to
send in a continuous stream of reserves
to repair ravages to their lines caused by
Russian counter attacks, the Turks ap
peared, early in August, after the occu
pation of Mush and Bitlis and the suc
cessful expedition into Persian territory
as far as Hamadan, to be in a fair way
toward accomplishing the task they had
undertaken.
Turning' Point in Campaign.
The turning point came soon after
the Turkish occupation of Mush, when
the Russian line in that neighborhood
stiffened suddenly. The battle begun
then continued uninterruptedly until
yesterday, when the Turkish forces,
despite their reported superiority in
numbers, fell back under the Russian
assault, conducted from the region of
Melasguerd and Gniskala, and left
Mush again in Russian hands.
The defeat of this group of the Turk
ish forces is considered by military
critics here to be of great importance,
because of the Turkish ability to hold ,
Mush and use ft- as a base of opera- j
tions against the Russian left wing
the success of their entire campaign in j
this region was predicated.

CONSTANTINOPLE. August 26.?
Hard fighting on the Caucasus front,
in which during one engagement the
Russians were forced to retreat, is also
reported in the official statement, which
reads:
"Caucasus front: We repulsed attacks
against our advanced positions on the
ri*?ht wing. At one point the enemy,
despite a three-fold superiority, was
forced to retreat before the resistance
of our troops. We captured prisoners.
There have been insignificant artillery
fights in the center, inuring a surprise

our left wing we killed twenty of the
enemy, including one officer, and cap

MRS. McADOO HAS TYPHOID.
Physicians Say Attack Is Slight and
Patient Is Doing Nicely.
SPRING LAKE, N. J, August 26.?
Mrs. William G. McAdoo, wife of the
Secretary of the Treasury and daugh
ter of President Wilson, who Is at her
summer home here suffering with what
her physicians describe as "a slight at
tack of typhoid fever," la reported to
cay as doing nicely.
Her illness, erroneously announced
last night as scarlet fever, was diag
nosed as typhoid by Dr. Cary T. Gray
son, the President's physician, in con
sultation with Dr. William Gray
Schauffley, surgeon general of New
Jersey.
Dr. Grayson returned today from
I Spring Lake. He declined to add any
thing to the official statement already
given out that Mrs. McAdoo was suf
fering from typhoid fever. He said he
would return to Spring Uke shortly
to render any assistance possible. Dr.
Grayson would not discuss a report
that Mrs. McAdoo might be suffering
from Infantile paralysis. He said that
the case had been carefully diagnosed,
and the physicians in attendance were
sure that the malady was typhoid fever.
It became known several days ago that
intimate relatives of Mrs. McAdoo
feared that she might have contracted
infantile paralysis.
Fever and headaches, which are both
symptoms of infantile paralysis, have
both been present, but the majority of
the symptoms all point to typhoid
fever.
Venice Faces Economic Crisis.
ROME. August 26.?Venice Is facing
a serious economic crisis as a result
of the war. The city government sent
yesterday a delegation to ask the na
tional government for special measures
of assistance. The people complain that
they have been deprived of the usual
business of the port, of their Income
from tourists and prevented from fish
ing In the Adriatic, cutting off their
customary sources of revenue. Premier
Boselll received the delegation and will
endeavor to aid the Venetians.

BODY OF SPRATLING
IS IN ATLANTA HOME
Military Escort for Georgia
Militia Captain Slain
by Woman.
MACON, Ga., An crust 26.?Accom
panied by a military escort the body of
Capt. Edgar J. 8pratling, F Company,
5th Regiment. National Guard of
Georgia, shot and killed at the state
mobilization camp here yesterday by
Mrs. H. C. Adams of Atlanta, was taken
early today to his home in Atlanta.
Burial will be at Opelika, Ala.
Mrs. Adams, formerly a patient of
Capt. 9oratling who in civil life was u
physiciain, last night was held by a
coroner's jury for the killing. In the
Bibb county Jail here she asserted that
she shot Capt. Sprat ling because of at
tentions paid her while she was In his
office iin Atlanta.
Woman Justifies Herself.
After several hours In jail Mrs. Adams
became hysterical, but frequently
declared that when she goes to trial
her course will be shown to have been
justified.
Mrs. Maud Monk, a trained nurse,
questioned by officers of the National
Guard at Camp Harris last night Is
said to have declared that she saw a
letter to Capt. Spratling from Mrs.
Adams threatening to kill him if he
did not see her. Officers at the camp
indicated belief that illness due to
nervous disorders caused Mrs. Adams
tQrthink Capt. Spuatling had acted im
properly to her.
Did Not Recognize Him.
Mrs. Adams came from her home in
Atlanta yesterday, and going to the
state camp inquired the way to Capt.
Spratling1s tent. Reaching the tent
she asked the officer, according to
other officers. If he were Capt. Sprat
ling. On being answered in the affirm
ative, she fired twice from a small cali
ber pistol, both shots taking effect.
Mrs. Adams, according to Lieut. Sam
uel A. Kysor of F Company, who seized
her a moment later, cried out as she
shot the officer, "You have ruined my
home."
After the shooting she seemed hys
terical, the lieutenant said, and begged
to be taken from the camp. She said
afterward she had never before seen
Capt. Spratling in his uniform, but that
he had treated her at his office in At
lanta for a nervous trouble.
"One Thing- for Me to Do."
Referring again to the shooting, she
declared:
"I decided that there was but one
thing for me to do, and I did it. When
the testimony comes out I feel sure
the public will be with me. I am con
fident I will go free."
Mrs. Adams, according to information
received here, left home in Atlanta
shortly after her husband had gone to
work, leaving her and the couple's
three small children at home. Late
yesterday she sent Adams the follow
ing telegram:
"Daddy, I am in jail. Do what you
can."
She said last night she had previously
told her husband of alleged ^improper
relations between her and the physi
cian, and added:
"My only regret Is that I did not tell
him sooner."
Capt. Spratling, about forty-seven
years old and married, was one of the
most popular officers in the regiment,
with which he had been connected for
several years, and was well known in
medical and social circles in Atlanta.
He was interested in iron mines in
Alabama and was medical adviser to an
insurance company in Atlanta.
The Husband's Statement.
H. C. Adams, husband of the accused
woman, issued a Ions statement when
told of the killing. Adams said that
his wife had been troubled with nerv
ousness and bad been treated by Capt.
Bpratllnff. Mrs. Adams told her hus
band. he s?ld, that-she bad objected to
remarks which she said the physician
made to her while she was in his office
before the mobilization order took him
to Macon.
Adams said he tried to get hit, wife
to visit relatives away from here,
thinking that would "relieve her mind
of the matter." He added that she told
him that she was going to Macon, but
that he did not suspect her intentions.

IN THE
SUNDAY STAR
HOUSE IS IN SHAPE
10 ADJOURN FRIDAY
Possibility of Ending Session
That Day Depends on the
Senate.
As far as the House is concerned,
Congress may adjourn Friday, but first
the deficiency appropriation bill must
be prepared and reported to the House.
This will be done Tuesday, according
to present arrangements. A final hear
ing on the deficiency bill was held to
day.
Because the situation in the Senate is
not so clear as it is in the House, mem
bers of the lower body are leaving
entire responsibility for adjournment
with the Senate. The fact that the
President's speech of acceptance of the
democratic nomination is set for Sep
tember 2 does not seem to enter into
the adjournment calculations . on the
House end of the Capitol.
"Must" Bills in House.
There are four pieces of legislation
i which are marked "must" in the House.
These are the deficiency appropriation
bill, the District appropriation bill, the
shipping bill and the revenue bill. The
Webb bill, to permit co-operation of
exporters in competing with foreign
firms in foreign fields, is looked upon
as a certainty to pass, but House lead
ers expressed a little hesitation today
as to the ability of the Senate to pass
that measure once it left the House.
On the other hand, there was talk of
lacking the Webb bill to the revenue
bill in the Senate.
The District appropriation confer
ence situation had made no advance
this morning because of the necessity
of the House conferees' attendance
upon the deficiency bill hearings.
Quorum Is Accumulating'.
The shipping bill depends upon a
quorum "of the House, which is slowly
accumulating, following a hurry call
sent out by the whips within the last
three days. The revenue bill's path will
be well cleared, it is believed. The
Senate will have changed it from its
original form when it l?ft the House,
but the House members of the confer
ence on the bill are following it, and
are prepared to make a record for
speed when the conference actually
begins.
Fails to Call TTp Bill.
Senator Owen of Oklahoma made an
other futile effort in the Senate today
to procure unanimous consent for con
sideration of the corrupt practices bill,
Senator Smoot objecting again to the
request. The Oklahoma senator pro
voked a wordy controversy when he
again charged the republicans with at
tempting to force adjournment of Con
gress next week, and questioned demo
cratic leaders regarding a reported
agreement to adjourn Friday. Senator
Simmons said there had been no formal
agreement, but that it was planned to
dispose of the general deficiency and
revenue bills by that time.
Senator Borah of Idaho said the re
publican leaders could not bind him to
any legislative program and that he
desired to vote on the corrupt prac
tice!. and immigration bills before ad
journment.
Senator ReStt-said the republicans did
not want to pass the corrupt prac
tices bill "because the old guard in
control of the party and the candidate
Want a corrupt electioii."
Indications were clearly given .that
there will be a close fight over Senator
Owen's motion when he makes it, and
upon the outcome depends the fate of
an early adjournment plan.
"The threat of endless debate on the
revenue bill by the republican leaders
in the Senate fcas flatly coerced some
of the democratic leaderB to yield the
democratic legislative program to pass
the corrupt practices act," Senator
Owen Mid.
BIG NAVAL "BATTLE"
OFF JERSEY COAST
Red and Blue Fleets Have
Been Engaged Since Early
This Morning in War Game.
SEVERAL FIGHTING SHIPS
PUT OUT OF THE ACTION
Contest Continues Until 5 O'Clock
This Evening Unless a Victory
Is Won Sooner.
The Red and Blue fleets have been
engaged 1n battle, the culmination of
the navy war game, since 5 o'clock this
morning, off Scotland lightship, Sandy
Hook.
Up to noon, by the umpire's decision,
the battleships Nevada and Texas and
the destroyers Wadsworth and Tucker
of the enemy Red fleet; the scout cruis
er Birmingham and the destroyers Ben
ham, Fanning, Balch, Drayton, and
several others of the Blue defending
fleet had been lost in action.
The battle will continue until 5
o'clock this afternoon, unless the um
pire, Rear Admiral Knight, decides one
fleet or the other has been decisively
defeated before that time.
Others May Be Lost.
Many other vessels may have been
constructively lost, but orders to the
commanders of the two fleets were
tha* ships regarded as sunk should
proceed to port immediately and their
arrival should not be reported.
The battle is being fought with every
man of each ship's company at his prop
er station, but the firing is done with
the small caliber batteries, employed in
training turret crews. They are one
pounder guns mounted upon the twelve
and fourteen Inch weapons of the main
batteries, so arranged that the sighting
is done through the use of the
mechanism of the big guns.
Umpires stationed on each ship judge
the firing conditions and determine
when the vessel has been put out of
commission by the fire of her opponents.
Department Well Satisfied.
"Whatever the outcome," declared
Rear Admiral Benson, chief of naval
operations, today, 'tit has been an excel
lent maneuver. The department is well
satisfied so far as its information now
goes with the way its plans have work
ed otit, and with the handling of the
fleet."
The red transports with the invading
army, which Admiral Mayo, command
ing the hostile fleet, apparently was
seeking to land in the vicinity of New
York, were reported as lying off Am
brose light, near Sandy Hook. Whether
the ships could proceed or would be
compelled to fltee for safety depended
on the outcome of the fight.
Few details of the battle reached the
Navy Department.

every day in the year for every man,
woman and child in the United States
was announced today by the executive
committee of the Pittsburgh Chamber
of Commerce.
This organization will carry the
matter to the United States Chamber of
Commerce, with the plea that it be sub
mitted to a referendum of the 250,000
business men who compose that body.
The plan is to have clocks throughout
the country advanced one hour, thus al
lowing everybody to begin the working
day an hour earlier and quit an hour
earlier.
As all sections would be affected, the
system, the chamber argues, would not
interfere with time regulation as pro
vided by the four zones of standard
time.

Both Sides to Controversy
Scheduled to Visit White '
House Today.~
PROSPECTS OF A STRIKE 1
ARE MORE THREATENING
Railroads Continue to Insist on Ar?
bitration of an Eight-Hoor
Day Question.
LEADERS OF MEN IMPATIENT
Claim They Are Not Getting ?
"Square Deal'' and That Employ
ers Are Playing for Time to
Spread Propaganda.
Definite decision in the impend
ing railroad strike will be reached
some time today, according to the
best judgment of a former federal
official who has been in close
touch with all the moves of the
mediation by the President and
who has sat in at a nuiber of the
conferences.
This opinion was indorsed by
Daniel Willard, president of the
Baltimore and Ohio railroad and
one of the select committee of
three who have been conferring
with the President. At 12 :y>
o'clock President Willard left the
meeting of the executives and said
he could not say at what hour the
reply of the railroads would be
sent to the White House, but that
definite decision would fee reached
today.
Situation Is "Tense."
What the decision will be no
one cared to prophesy. That the
situation is "tense" was admitted
on all sides.
Members of the general com
mittee of 640 are packing up,
paying their hotel bills and pre
paring to go home, leaving au
thority to call a strike in the
hands of the four big brotherhood
presidents. ?
President Still Is Hopeful.
President Wilson regards the rail
road situation as serious, but has not
1 yet given up hope of a settlement. Ho
will continue to use every effort to
bring both sides together.
Both to Visit White House. '
Both parties to the controversy are
to visit the White House today?the
railroad presidents to lay before the
President their partial rejection of his
proposal and their counter proposition,
the brotherhood committee to hear
what the railroads propose.
Brotherhood leaders had received no
official advices regarding the railroad
presidents' proposition when the regu
lar daily meeting of the employee* ?
committee convened at 11 o'clock. The
workmen's committee planned to re
main in continuous session until they
heard from President Wilson, who had
promised them some word by noon.
No word in regard to the situation
having arrived, the employes' meeting
adjourned shortly after noon until 2
o'clock. Meanwhile the president* of
the four brotherhoods remained at their
hotel awaiting a summons from the
White House. They were without offi
cial knowledge of the railroad head^
position.
The four brotherhood heads went Into
secret session before 10 o'clock this
morning to consider the unofficial re
port of the railroads' position, which
they had obtained from newspapers.
They had received no word from the
White House and .did not expeot to
confer with the President, they said,
until after he had received a delega
tion from the railroad executive*.
Division of Opinion.
Opinion was divided among the en*
ployes as to how the railroads' proposal
would be received. None of them thought
that it would be accepted without qualifi
cation, and a large number of them de
clared that if the railroads continue to
insist upon arbitration of all question^
including the eight-hour day, a strike
inevttably would follow.
The railway executives went into ses
sion at 10 o'clock to take^flnal action on
the proposal they will submit to Presi
dent Wilson. Since the executives de
termined upon the nature of their pro-,
posal and drafted their reply last night
the committee of eight has gone over
and smoothed dov.-n the wording of the
letter to the President. In their meeting
this morning the railway executives were
expecting to approve the committee's
final draft, which then will be submitted
to President Wilson.
The President is understood to be dis
appointed and rather aggrieved that hie
efforts at mediation for two weeks have
apparently failed to win an agreement, es
pecially since he feels that he has won
each side over to the main demands of'
the other, and that the railroads are now
making a demand upon him that he can
not meet. He notified the railroad chiefs *
last night that he wants a decision
reached before tonight.
Labor Leaders Impatient.
The four big brotherhood leaders, while
they appreciate that the President haa
done all he could to bring about a set-^
tlement, have told him plainly that.,
they do not believe they can hold the -
general committee of 640 chairmen
after tonight, as these leaders feel that
they are not getting a -square deal*4.
and that the railroads are merely play*
