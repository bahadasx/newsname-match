If the United States buys the

St Thomas is a natural Gibraltar.
The entrance to the harbor is very

FACTIONS ARE
AT A DEADLOCK
Brotherhoods Insist on Eight
Hour Day; Railroad
Presidents Delay.
WASHINGTON. D. C. Aug. 2S.
With negotiations for averting
the threatened rairoad strike,
piactlcally at a deadlock, president
"rt'ilson today suddenly went to th
capitol and conferred with adminis
tration leaders over the possibility of
legislation.
The president conferred first witk
Democratic leader Kent and chairman
Newlanda of the interstate commerce
committee who. It was understood,
after a canvass of th. mn...in..i
T situation, had concluded it was feasi
ble to get through congress before ad
journment, as an amendment to the
pending bill to Increase the member
ship of the interstate commerce com
mussion. come sort of an expression that
the railways should be authorised to
make rate increases to meet hieher
I aSes and to provide some sort of ma
j chinery for arbitration for similar dis
putes in the future possibly along the
lines of the Canadian commission.
Brotherhoods Are Impatient.
Just before the president went to the
capitol the brotherhood leaders, impa
tient at the delay of the railroad ex
ecutives in replying to the president's
last proposal, declared that only the
unqualified concession of the eight
hour day or some action by congress
to cause the government to operate
the railroads could prevent the threat
ened strike.
On all hands the president's visit to
the capitol was taken as IndlcaUn
that the situation had reached a.
crisis.
Later it was learned at the capitol
that the president told the senators the
railroad executives had "put it up to
him" to get some guarantee from con
gress that they would be permitted to
get more revenue to meet the increase
in wages.
J vte On Railroad Reply.
The threated railway strike sit
uation took on an added tensity to
day as the railway' executives con
tired their deliberation!, over the form
of their counter proposal to president
Wilson's plan and the brotherhood lead
ers silently awaited the next move
The executives have been toldnhat
the men's leaders expect difficulty In
restraining them after tonight The
presidents worked steadily all morning
PJ,sln" their statement to president
Wilson, but shortly after noon had
taken no final vote on it.
Leaders of the brotherhoods sent
word to president Wilson Friday night

men. The brotherhood representatives

laith In practicing dilatory tactics.
"Bnck-flre" TelrsTama Sent.
The brotherhoods sent to president
Wilson copies of numerous "back-fire"
telegrams alleged to have been sent by
the railroads to their agents in the
west, directing them to urge commer
cial organizations, shippers and others
to wire the president to make a stand
for arbitration and directing that the
expense of the telegrams be charged to
the railroads.
The president stated he had received
i many of the telegrams and Indicated he
j was not pleased with them,
I ome Prrldrnt Favor Strike,
j Some of the railroad presidents are
j understood to be In favor of letting the
matter go to a strike, believing yielding
to the brotherhoods now would merely
bring trouble later on. They are said
to be of the opinion that a strike would
Inst but a few days and that means
would be found for transporting the
mails and making food shipments to the
larger cities.
WiWun Com To Capitol.
President Wilson suddenly left the
w-hite house and ten t the capitol In
connection with the threatened railway
strike.
Among brotherhood officials this af-
1 temoon. it was declared, that only un-
qualified concession by the railroads of
tne eignt nour aay. or action 01 con-
gress taking over the railways for
government operation, couia prevent
the threatened strike.
