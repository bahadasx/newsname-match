READY F0H BIG ENCAMPMENT
Kansas City Prepared to Entertain
Big Crcwd of Veterans at tho
National Gathering.
Each of the 23,0d0 vr-tcrnns who

he did not meet hero some comrade

It Is tho chance to live over again
the days from '01 to '05, to fight again
the battles nnd to recall tho memor
able things that happened, both tragic
ami laughable, that will prompt tho
boys" to flock to the encampment.
At other encampments certain regi
ments havo managed -.to- gather for
llttlo reunions of their own and It
wan there tho spirit of tho encamp
ments was strongest. But thcro has
been no systematic effort In other
cities to help tho veterans find the
comrades of their old regiments
Kansas City has taken up that foa-
ure of the encampment In detail and
It will be possible for any regiment,
with two or more survivors In attend
ance, to hold Its own little reunion.
There will be forty-eight booths in the
arcade nt Convention Hall for tho lit
tle gatherings. If needed, space out
side the hall will be provided for the
larger regiments.
Frank Bliss, chairman of the com
mittee in charge of regimental re
unions, has sent 125,000 return postal
cards to tho adjutants of tho 5,250
poMs of tho G. A. It., with requests
that each veteran tell the Kansas City
committee whether ho will attend and
to what regiment ho was attached.
As the cards promising attendance
are received they are filed by regi
ments and It will bo possible to tell
any visitor at once wnat memoers oi
his regiment are in tho city and where
and when they will meet,
I havo learned that what the vet
erans appreciate most is meeting tho
men with whom they fought shoulder
to shoulder," ho said. "In other years
they have been left to work out the
regimental reunions themselves. Wo
rorpose to make all tho arrangements
for them this year."
WILL CURB CITY BARBERS

Overcharging at Kansas City
May Revoke Licenses.
Never agair. will the young man
from the country bo charged $2 for a

In the vicinity of the Union Station,
or anywhere else in Kansas City
not if tho stato board of barber ex

It can.

covered that $55, his summer's sav
ings, wero missing.
Tho two white, men and a negro
porter were held by tho police and
turned over to tho state authorities,
by whom they were charged with
grand larceny.
Mr. Dorranco stated that many com
plaints havo been tuado to the board
of overcharges and that the board in
tends to take drastic action in every
case where overcharges can be prov
ed, it being within the province' of tho
board to revoke tho license of any
barber making an overcharge.
In tho old Union avenue days it was
a common thing to overcharge stran
gers in tho city for barber work, but
Mr. Dorrance saya that tho conditions
will not bo allowed to develop in or
around the new Union Station.

f IS un cii.sy task, but
not altogether u con
genial one, to write
about the hawks of
America In whose lives
the evil outweighs the
good. When one sots
down black marks

icter he Invites death for the bird, and
Jils Is not a pleasant tiling to do for

' tor breakfast.
It is easy to write about the Injuri-
jus hawks of this country because
! shore are so few of them. Most of
ur birds of prey, tho hawks and tho
I ,ln tKon hnpm Tlmrn
ire only a scant half dozen or so Into
ivhom nature has Implanted the desire
for evil deeds. Nature Is supposed to
lo everything, or at any rate almost
:verythlng, well and so It may be that
f we kill the belli buccaneer birds who
lo a bit of thieving now and then, we
nay rue It one day for some reason
lot yet disclosed to the human mind.
The scientists tell us that perhaps
he two most Injurious hawks In Amcr
i'n are tbo sharp-shlntied and the coop
er hawks. These two birds do n large
part of the thieving which the? farm
rs of the country lay nt the door of
he soaring hawk, tho red-tailed, tho
ed-sliouldered, and .some others.
The sharp-shinned gentleman, called
Vcclplter veins, by the ornitholo
gists, Is, as somebody has put It, "a
iruto of a bird." Vernon llulley of
.he biological survey of the depart
ncnt of agriculture has written thus
ilmut this bird of more than question
ible life:
''Aiming the hawks, tho Miarp
ililmii'd is a veritable bushwhacker.
'Us light body, short wings, niul fong
tail enable him to double and turn
imiing tho brush and branches, nnd In
I noiseless, foxllko way, pounce over a
ledgerow or brush heap Into the midst
)f a llock of sparrows, swoop under
he low branches anil pick his bird
'mm tho ground, or dart through the
.reetops mid snatch one In midair from
ho midst of u startled llock. Ills

jensated by Ids audacity that one bird

The Cooper hawk, called by tho sci
entists Aeclplter cooperll. Is Just ns
much of a villain, If you want to look
at him that way, nS Is his brother Ae
clplter, surnamed velox. This bird Is
Just ns daring as the sharp-shinned,
and being somewhat larger Is uble to
attack successfully larger prey. Dr.
A. K. Fisher, the foremost American
authority on tho birds of prey, lias this
to say about the freebooter under dis
cussion :
"Cooper's hawk, which resembles
tho sharp-shinned hawk closely In
everything except sl.e. Is less north
ern In Its distribution. . . . Tho
food of this hawk, like that of Its
smaller congener, consists almost en
tirely of wild birds and poultry, though
from Its superior size nnd strength it
Is able to cope successfully with much
larger birds, and hence Is much moro
to bo dreaded. . . . The (light of
this species Is very rapid, Irregular,
and usually Is carried nt no great height
from the ground, in all these particu
lars closely resembling that of the
sharp-shinned hawk."
One of the most destructive of the
American birds of prey Is the gos
hawk, otherwise Aeclplter utrlcupll
lus. The goshawk Is a big bird, some
thing mure than a foot and n half In
length, and seemingly It has tho
strength of well we won't say ten,
but two. Its nesting plnee Is either In
the mountains or way up in the north
ern regions. It preys on giimo birds
and rabbits In the summer season nud
In the winter It comes southward froin
Its summer home to take Its pick of
the fat poultry of the land. Tho
goshawk Is a daring and a hardy bird.
It typilles tho wild life of mountain
and plain, and as such It seemingly
might be allowed to keep Its place 111
nature's plan, but sentiment usually Is
allowed to count for little when the
loss of a prize rooster or hen Is In the
other side of the balance.
Now wo get uway from the acciplters
and get Into the Genus Falco. The
duck hawk, Falseo peregrlnus nnntum,
Is n truu falcon. Florenco Merrlntn
Bailey, In her "Handbook of Birds of
tho Western United Slntes," says that
tho duck hawk ranks next to the gos
howk ns a llerco bird of prey. Accord
ing to my way of looking at It, bad as
tho bird is, any man who shoots It
ought to bo shot himself. The duck
hawk has that high courage which
ought to appeal to everybody who has
red blood la lilm on his own account,
Flowers will turn to the light of tho
electric lamp Just us they do to the
sun.
A solution of soft soup, Instead of
water, was used In making n water

bank in Budapest.
In 'granting concessions for develop
ment of Its recently discovered potash
deposits Spain Is requiring concession
aries to reserve fpr national consump
tion such parts of the salts us the
government deems advisable.
Tho duck hawk flies as swift nnd as
straight as the proverbial nrrow. No
poultry raiser has any grudge against
this falcon, foF It disdains tamo and
humble quarry nnd JIvos like nn epi
cure almost wholly upon game. Tho
duck hawk will strike down in mid
air a bird of twice Its weight, and It
will overtake the swiftest winged duck
that (lies. He Is a pirate and every
thing elso that Is bad, but he lives tho
free and untrnmmeled life which na
ture taught him to Uvo nnd so If It Is
necessary to kill something, go and kill
nature.
There probably are no Injurious
hawks In tho United States except
those which have been named. Of
course this qualified statement may b
disputed, but for tho most part our
hawks ure known to bo largely bene
ficial and concerning those about which
there Is some doubt the balance of
good and evil seems to bo Just about
even. The hawks that havo been
named and In part described nre, as
one might say, the worst of the bunch.

America ns u progressive democracy

tlmo conserve the stamina of her work

M. Warburg of the banking house ot
Kuhn, Loeb and company, brother of
Paul M. Warburg of tho federal re
serve board. Ho was referring es
pecially to the health Insurance bill
brought out by tho American associa
tion for labor legislation this year. Mr.
Warburg explains his Interest In health
Insurance by his tlrst-hand acquaint
ance with its working In Germany.
"I lived In Germany ut the tlmo
tho law for health Insurance was
passed and put Into operation nnd tho
effect from what I have been told has
been excellent," lio said. "It Is only
by menns of n system of universal
health Insurance that the service of
advanced inedlcnl science can bo
brought to the care of the workers
as a whole, whllo ot the some tlmo
the payment of Joint contributions
brings economic pressuro to bear on

er hmiself to prevent disease. In oth
er words, under health Insurance all
parties concerned aro made to feel tho
