MACHINERY FOR
KEYSTONE ILL
REACHES MIKE
tFrora Oatman Section Dailr Miner.
Mill men for the Keystone, accom
panied by T. H. Fitzgerald, secretary
of the company, arrived in Chloride
Wednesday morning. Thursday work
commenced on the foundations of the
mill. Part of the machinery has ar
rived and will be placed in position
by October 15, at which time the mill
will be in running order.
The Desert Power company has con
tracted to have power in Mineral Park
by October 1. The power company's
inability to get transformers has
caused the delay in entering this field.
The transformers, however, have now
been purchased and are on their way
tn Kineman.
The mill will be of 100 tons capac-
ity and built in such a manner that it
can be increased in size at any time.
The mill is being erected by the Fields
Floatation company of Seattle, Wash.
The Holmes property at Mineral
Park have curtailed their force pend
ing the erection of the mill, but Mr.
Holmes says that now, since opera
tions have commenced on the mill, the
forces on both properties will be in
creased. As soon as the mill is completed the
same company has contracted to erect
a similar plant on the Midnight The
latter, however, will be of larger ca
pacity, as the Midnight's ore bodies
are of larger extent and lower grade
than the Keystone.
Before the curtailment of forces the
two Keystones employed 75 men in de
velopment work.

START OPERATIONS
fFrnm Oatman Section Daily Miner.)
Work is to be started in a short
time on the Paragon group, lying be
tween the Lazy Boy and Esperanza.
It is given out that a shaft will be
sunk 500 feet, from which depth
crosscuttine and drifting will be
prosecuted.
It previously was opened by a 200'
font tunnel, bv Joseph KrauSS. locator
and former owner. He. states that

D. S. Scoville, a mining engineer,
will arrive shortly from Chicago as
a representative of Blachford and
Cameron, who are fiscal agents for
the company. W. C. Eichenberger I
will represent the company in Oatman.
ADAMS SHAFT IS
CLOSE JO LEDGE
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner.)
The Adams shaft seems to be break
ing into its ledge, or at least is in
some stringers that must be close to
it It has struck vein matter and it
carriessome values. Just how rich
is not given out, by Superintendent
W. F. Kilker, but he says that while
it looks very encouraging the values
are nothing to get excited about
In Tuesday's issue it was stated
that the formation showed mineral
and apparently was nearly the ledge.
At that time it was 225 feet deep.
It is about 245 now.
Since a great deal of high grade ore
has been found in the southern end
of the camp on the surface and par
ticularly on other properties near
there,, as well as some on the Adams
itself, it is not unlikely that when
the ledge is tapped it will prove good.
The neighbors of the Adams are the
Crescent, Wrigler, Nellie, Black
Eange, Oatman Syndicate, Green
Quartz and others.
OPERATIONS TO BE RESUMED
AT THE HACKBERRY MINE
From Wednesday Daily Miner
Manager L. W. Wickes yesterday
sent out supplies and prepared to re
sume work at the Hackberry mine,
which shut down a few days ago.
Mr. Wickes reports that several
good faces of ore have been opened
up and that with greater depth and
systematic exploration of the ground
above the 500 level, the mine should
pull out a winner.
Shipping ore has been opened up
la the property, but blocking' out will
be continued for some time to ascer
tain the possibilities of the mine as
a shipper of smelting ores.
UNITED WESTERN
COTS EtUNGH OF ORE
(From Oatman Section Daily Miner.)
The United Western is working as j
vigorously as ever in quest of an ore (
shoot thrifc the mnnrurement feel that i
it is due to find inhe north central
poition of he camp where the United
Eastern ledge ought to pass through.
Its shaft is 500 feet deep and it has
done 500 feet of drifting, which is
more work than any property in the
camp except the Goldroad ,Tom Reed,
United Eastern, Boundary Cone and
Pioneer.
A few days ago one of the drifts
passed through a small body of ore,
but it did not hold out With more
than the faith of the biblical grain of
mustard, the management is hanging
on and has hung on during all kinds
of verbal storms of knocking and
slurs of unappreciation. It still stands
the same show of striking ore as any
of the properties working and until it
is demonstrated that such is beyond
its powers and present management
will persevere.
ONE POUND OF ODE
YIELDS $9 IN GOLD
(From Oatman Section Daily Miner.
One pound of rock it does not mat
ter from whtiC property it came, so
long as it W3 from the Oatman dis
trict yielded over $9 worth of gold
yesterday when pulverized for assay
ing at the office of F. O. Altinger.
The first extraction amounted to over
half an ounce in weight, but Mr. Al
tinger stated that when refined the
gold would arriount to slightly more
than $7. Then the tailings were
worked down and contained something
over $2 more in fine gold.
An assayer's relations with his cus
tomer are inviolate and the tatter's
identity and that of his property must
not be divulged. This is a case merely
to show that there is high grade in
the Oatman district and as long as it
is here it does not really matter what
property it comes from.
The $7 amount was run intoia but
ton and the tailings panning, while
being worked down in the afternoon
were shown to the Daily Miner cor
respondent and, to say the least, were
inspiring.
is
The Goldroad-Bonanza's crosscut on
the 350-foot level is out 35 feet and
advancing steadily. It is estimated
that it will take about 60 feet to cut
the ledge at that depth.
The plan is merely to open and ex
amine the ledge as to values at that
point, but not to drift unless the rich
ness there is extraordinary, binlang
will be resumed and continued to the
500-foot level at least and the ore
taken out and placed on the surface
by the cheaper and more scientific
method of raising and stoping all of
it in a lot
Since the values on the surface and
in the shaft where the ledge was cut
were better than $5, the management
feels no uncertainty over results with
the proper depth, and expects shoots
of ore from connecting veins from the
Goldroad ledge, which is parallel and
only 150 feet to the north.
WALSH WILL BRING
MONEYED PEOPLE HERE
J. J. Walsh departed yesterday for
the coast and will be back in a short
time with a number of important peo
ple who are considering investing in
Oatman on his recommendation. He
stated upon arrival this week that
he knew of people who would come
here with that intention in a short
time and it would only be necessary
for the hot weather to pass for the
residents to prepare to welcome them.
Mr. Walsh, by the erection of the
largest business block in the city, the
three-story concrete Walsh building,
has shown that he is a' thoroughbred
-when it comes to talking about faith
in Oatman and he has never for
moment weakened in his optimism.
Marion ' Abineau of the Chloride
Drug Company came in from that
place yesterday.
IS
SOLD BY
TO
From Tuesday's Daily Miner
Representatives of a syndicate of
Chicago people yesterday entered in
to an agreement for the purchase of
the Cyclopic mine in the Gold liasin
country from Stanley C. Bagg, and
$5,000 payment was made. The deal
was brought about by A. G. Frazier,
who has been operating properties
in this county the past year.
The Cyclopic mine has been operat
ed by Mr. Bagg for five or six years,
and during the time he has taken from
one stope in the property between
$50,000 and 60,000. The drift on the
same level hasi been driven 300 feet
in ore. A small mill has been crush
ing the ore, it being found necessary
to crush the ore to pass through a 10-
mesh screen, after which all the gold,
with exception of about 20 cents, is
recovered.
The new owners are to at once
remodel the mill and add greatly .to
its capacity. Development will also
be carried on in the mine, a shaft to
go several hundred feet below the pre
sent level being contemplated. C. D.
Rooklidee. well known in Kingman
and Oatman, will be in charge of the
property for the new owners. It is
estimated that there is 50,000 tons of
$10 ore in sight in the mine at present,
and many thousands of tons can be
opened at small cost.
Mr. Bagg, who is selling the prop
erty has done an immense amount of
work on the mine and has made it pay
well during the past several years.
He is an old newspaper man, having
edited and published the Tombstone
Epitaph and Prospector in the early
days of the camp.
The Cyclopic is situated 40 miles
north of Kingman and in one of the
most accessable parts of the Cerbat
range.
INSPECTS STRIKE
IN OATMAN GOLD
(From Oatman Section Daily Miner.)
Eli Hilty yesterday paid a flying
visit to the Kokomo property of the
Oatman Gold Mining & Milling com
pany at Oatman, where report had it
that a big strike of ore had been made
on the 500-foot level. He states that
the strike was made all right and that
the ore is as rich as reported.
The whole width ofv the drift is in
ore of a value close to $50 per ton,
This drift is being driven into the ore
as fast as machines can do the work.
The drift is now getting under the sur
face outcropping, where high values
were found by the original owners. It
is probable that a long shoot of this
rich ore will be opened.
FEDERAL COURT WILL
CONVENE AT TIME SET
The Daily Miner yesterday wired
the clerk of the United States Court
for information of the next sitting of
the court. It received a reply that
court would convene in Prescott on
September 4 and the grand jury would
begin its sitting two days later.
Many witnesses and jurors have
been called from this county and have
been anxious to get definite informa
tion, as it was reported that no ses
sion would be held until later in the
month. The convening of the court
so close to the primaries will be a
hardship on some of the candidates
who have been called as witnesses and
jurors. '
MOSS TO SINK DEEPER
AFTER UN1TERING
From Oatman Section Daily Miner.
The unwatering of the old Moss
mine will be completed abous August
28, according to A. C. Werden, mana
ger of the company that has purchas
ed the property.
Immediately thereafter sinking 'will
be started and will be continued to a
further depth of 200 feet, the present
depth of the old bonanza being 220.
It is a vertical shaft. At 420 a cross
cut for the ledge will be driven and
drifting or any other necessary work
will be done.
The unwatering is being done by
three shifts of baling with a large
bucket and while slow it is thought
that there will be no difficulty in
holding the water down to a much
greater depth without the purchase
of a pump at this time.
CYCLOPIC
PURCHASE OF QUEEN
BY UNITED EASTERN
IS
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner.)
Various rumors have had it of late
that the United Eastern magnates,
who recently purchased control of the
Sunnyside company, have also ac
quired the Oatman Queen.
Seeley W. Mudd, Colonel D. C. Jack
ling, Frank A. Keith, Phillip Wise
man and others are the capitalists in
question. J. A. Kennard, who has
been in charge of the property, states,
that it has been financed and it is
presumed that this deal is referred to.
The former heads of the company
were B. M. Johnson, Frank Gvvynne,
F. E. Agnew, W. E. Moore and Mr.
Kennard.
COUNTRY ROCK OF THE
At a meeting of the directors of
the Oatman-Combination, held Mon
day, it was decided to increase the
underground force sufficiently to run
two crosscuts and henceforth the sec
ond opening will be-driven to the
north. A ledge that was cut in the
shaft between the 100 and 200 should
be reached in about 100 feet At the
depth that it was opened it gave an
average assay of $3.71. President R.
L. Johns, who is most conservative
in his views as to estimating possible
values, believes that it should be com
mercial ore at the present depth of
525.
The south crosscut is out 50 feet
and is in a most promising country.
It cut through a rhyolite dyke for 25
feet, which gave average assays of $2
to $5 and for 25 feet more in the for
mation Jthe same values are found.
Mr. Johns says they will average $3
in both dyke and country rock, which
gives hope of soon striking an ore
body of the highest importance and
commensurate values. Such an in
tense mineralization in the country
rock and dyke are unprecedented in
Oatman mines and the greatest ex
pectations result in the minds of
those who have labored and spent
their money 'in an effort to maKe the
Combination intp a mine.
' Another thing that will surprise
people is the fact that tungsten has
"been found in the shaft. Near the
400- a stringer of eight inches was cut
and fhought to be manganese. Its
looks were not convincing, however,
and different parties looked at it, un-
'til it was decided to send it to Gold'
road for testing. No quantitative
analysis was made, but it was found
to be wolframite. It hurts no gold
mine to have tungsten in the same
neighborhood.
The Chicago Syndicate, under the
energetic management of C. R. Mc-
Collora, has driven its crosscut 130
feet The object of the crosscutting
at this time, the depth being 250 feet,
is to merelv explore the underground
region and fix a plan of development
when lower depths are attained. In
a short time the shaft will be con
tinued to 500 feet, where it is hoped
and believed that ore will be exposed.
There is a fine surface ledge system
containing four veins, all in a com
paratively narrow space.
KINGMANWILL HAVE
v BIG BUILDING BOOM
lrnrnvn business man of
Kingman, in conversation with a Daily
Miner representative, yesterday stated
that he knew of many fine residences
'and business buildings that would be
erected before the first of next Jan
uary. Plans for many of the build
ings have already been prepared and
others are in course of preparation.
Kingman needs fully 100 houses for
residential purposes, and should they
be erected tenants would be forth
coming. I
R. L. Hogue aid wife of the Tung
sten mines is in Kingman.
GOLD ORE TO HAVE
ITS 01 MILL SOON
Before starting for San Francisco
yesterday forenoon, via Kingman," A.
C. Werden stated that it would be a
matter of only a little more time until
he would be able to announce definite
news in regard to a mill .for the Gold
Ore property at Goldroad. He said
there were-several deals pending to
that end and it was uncertain which
one might go through, but it was cer
tain that the mill would come as" a
result of one of them.
That the property will justify a
mill there is no question. For sev
eral months past it has been shipping
ore to the Goldroad mill at a rate,
it is stated, of 30 tons a day. The
ore has given a general average of
about $20 a ton, with some as low as
$15 and considerable worth $35.
Naturally only a 'small amount has
been milled 'under the circumstances.
and an immense amount is held in re
serve for the company's own plant
The Gold Ore is one of the real
producing mines of Arizona. It ships
ore with constant regularity and
could keep a mill of its own going
for years. With the liberal manage
ment of Manager Werden, who looks
to the welfare of the town he lives
in, it will be a great thing for Gold
road and the whole Oatman country.
L
STRIKES BIG BODY
OF MILLING ROCK
From Oatman Section Dally Mhur.l
The Lexington-Arizona seems des
tined to- be the next real mine of
Oatman. At a vertical depth of 110
feet and 126 in an incline shaft, it has
opened 30 inches of ore that averages
$13.50 a ton. This information is de
finite and is vouched for by Manager
H. E. Woods.
There are nine feet or more of poms
oxidized quartz on the footwall that
.will pay to mill. Mr. Woods has not
figured the average and does not make
.that as an authorized statement, but'
lie has had a number of assays run
and others who have averaged them
have found the nine feet to run $10
a ton.
In every way the ore looks like that
of the Tom Reed and other mines of
the district at the point where ore1
was struck. Its shallow depth causes
it to be unusually oxidized, but other
wise it is the typical white quartz of
fthe camp and all there for every re
quirement to make the Lexington into
'a mine as soon as enough of this ore
"shall have been blocked our to give
it an "in sight" tonnage.
What gives a thrill of joy to all
who have stood by Oatman through
pthe darkest hours is the fact that it
is off of the main ledge and with the
striking of this ore body Mr. Woods
has shattered the theory of the croak-.
'ers that there could be no ore in Oat
man save on the one main ladge of
the Tom Reed and United Eastern,
and that right in face of the fact of
the Goldroad on another ledge has
taken out millions.
The Lexington has been sinking
several shallow shafts off and on for
a year or more and from one main
shaft was supplying Old Trails with
water for domestic use. This was
sold to the Oatman Water and Sewer
fcompany and the company will stick
to mining for gold.
' The incline on the hanging wall
-side was started there to afford eas
ier work, which was done without
power drills and at 126 feet water
was encountered. Not being prepared
at present to go beyond the water
level and the ledge having straighten
ed up to the extent of dipping inverse
ly out of the shaft, a crosscut for it
was started and was soon at home in
the ledge matter again. The moment
it was struck it looked natural -and
like the real thing being sought fori
'and Mr. Woods felt so jubilant over
'it that he asked the Daily Miner to
say nothing until the whole ledge was
crosscut, for he did not want another
flash in the pan- in Oatman. This was
two weeks ago. The ledge has proved
to be 30 feet wide and about 21 feet
of it will run a few dollars around
$4 and $6 and odd amounts. There
are seams of good stuff interlaced
here and there and in the nine feet
that condition is especially apparent
It is a very; interesting find and one
that is destined from every reasonable
TO BE
COMPLETE BY END
O'F THIS MONTH
Recently the Daily Miner predict
ed that the new road over the Gold
road hill would be completed by Sep
tember 1, and now it seems that the
prediction is not to be far off. The
engineer in charge has informed the
men that they will be laid off on that
date by reason of the work being done,
and advised them to seek new em-
ployment Several have made appli
cation for pther work.
Surfacing is in progress now, and
will continue to the last minute. With
this exceedingly dry weather it will
be hard to pack that character of ma
terial satisfactorily, and it is noped
that before the day when autos are al
lowed upon it that a few good rains
will come to take the bulk of the work
off the hands of the county's men. Not
that the latter do not need the work
the more, but nature is a better' hand
at the job, always doing it better the
world over.
Rock work yet to be done consists
of two cuts. One is at the summit
and the other below No. 3 shaft of
the Goldroad mine. Both are com
paratively short a"hd can be completed
with the resources in, men and ma
terial in the time stated.
The first cars to break the roads
will start from the summit and make
the down grade run, which will make
it a short task indeed.
SAMARITAN PROPERTY
WILL BE DEVELOPED
The Samaritan group in the Lost
Basin district is about to' be operated
on a good scale. Supplies wilt go out
to the camp this morning and the ma
chinery will follow soon. A camp has
already been established in a well sit
uated part of the property.
The Lost Basin country should be
come one of the best mining sections
of the state, the veins being large and
well mineralized.
OF UNION PASS STOCK
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner.)
H. O. Granberg of Wisconsin, who
was here recently has made another
investment, the details of which he
completed while here. He has pur
chased 50,000 shares of Oatman
Revenue stock, which company has a
promising property at Union Pass. He
will be back in September or October
and visit the property, making sug
gestions then as to plans for systema
tic development
The company has men at work on
a road of one mile to reach the camp
site. There is a lot of rock work to
be dbne. With that accomplished the
site for the shaft and camp will be
leveled and in a short while under
ground work will be inaugurated.
INFLUX WILL START
AFTER HOT WEATHER
(From Oatman Section Daily Miner.)
"A lot of good people are coming
to Oatman as soon as the hot weather
is over," said J. J. Walsh, owner of
the Walsh building, yesterday after
arriving from his home at Monrovia.
"I came in Sunday and the camp is
not looking so bad to me. It looks
fine, in fact There is nothing wrong
with it"
J. S. Withers came In Wednesday
from the coast where he has been
for some time with his wife and
children.
calculation to figure heavily in the
:'near future and the great hereafter of
'Oatman.
The Lexington is just east of Old
Trails town, part of the group being
in the town. The shaft where the
strike was made is closest to town and
'is in sight on the ridge from the auto
road. The ledge system is of immense
importance. One ledge comes out of
the Boundary Cone, another near
mine with milling ore at 550 and 750.
Another comes, from the Gold Dust
or Orion. Various ones converge in
the Lexington ground and are in plain
sight with high standing croppings.
