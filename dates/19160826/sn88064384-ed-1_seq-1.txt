A Card to Owners
of Rural Telephone Lines
We are anxious to see that all lines owned by
nther parties and connected with us are kept in such
condition as to furnish efficient service. Where the
owners of rural lines are responsible for their upkeep,
we want to co-operate with them.
All lines require a thorough overeauling occa
fionally if the best service is to be obtained. We
recommend that every line connected with us be
overhauled at least once a year, and that at least one
experienced telephone man assist in this work. The
cost of this work when divided among all the patrons
of the line, makes the amount paid by each man
mall, and this cost will be more than offset by the
improved service.
If the owners of rural telephone lines in this sec
tion are experiencing trouble with their service, we
will appreciate their talking the matter over with our
Manager or writing us fully. We will gladly do
what we can toward helping you improve the con
dition of your lice.
