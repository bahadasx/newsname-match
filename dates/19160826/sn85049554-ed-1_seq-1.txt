according to his understanding wKh tho

Breaking Point .Reached.
Following a seriea of stormy sessions
yesterday un^ last night the railroad
presidents agreed to make a counter
proposal to President Wilson .today,
conceding the principle of the eight
nour day,- but demanding arbitration
of the question of the wages to be paid
for Mich day.
President Wilson's orlglral proposal
provided that the present pay which
the men get for. ten houfs' trork should
be given them for the reduced hours
and overtime at pro rata pay.
Have Strike Order Ready.
The brotherhood chiefs said they
would not accept this compromise.
They assert they wiy strike first, and
they point out ttiat they are all ready
to order the men to quit their Jobe.
They even have the strike order
printed, with only the date of Issuance
missing, ai)d they clbiii^ to have con
verted fill their resource!, into cash and
ciuickly convertible securities and that
the total amount available to care for
the strikers is (15,000,000,
The action of the railroad presidents
was in consequence of several events
which transpired during the day and
afternoon.
Spokesmen of the brotherhoods
told the. president that they are
experiencing feat difficulty In re
straining the 640 chairmen in Wasn
ington, who believe the situation is be
ing toyed with by the' railr6ad execu
tives, and hold that the only thing to
do Is to go back home and order the
strike.
Promises Adjustment Today.
Mr. Wilson informed his callers that
until Thursday night the railroad offi
cials were unwilling to make conces
sions without, .unacceptable conditions.
He promised that he would give a defi-'
nite answer by noon today, intimating
that unless the railroad response rvas
satisfactorily he would release the msa
from the pledges they had made to
him.
Then the president sent for the com
mittee of railroad heads. He was brief
and to the point vith them. He told
them that the negotiations were drag
ging and that he could not permit any
further procrastination. He said he
must ask for prompt action.
When the railroad heads were in
formed of'the president's nclif-tatlon
the lid blew "off. What was said by
some of them about Mr. Wilson isn't
fit for publication.
Fear Result in Future.
The excuse Is that they have been at
a high state of tension for days: that
they have resented the president's ac
tion hi falling to hear their side 'be
fore presenting his program, which they
recognize «a an ultimatum that they
are apprehensive of the effect of an
eight-hour, day vfpon their prqa VJaa
and that his rejection of arfcfh»^_ "...

-•Tf#t::eo«£ las:' the-HdJroad. executives
itfg.at Hr Wilson, few dare to take
the responsibility of leaving Washing
ton without an agreement, thereby pre
cipitating a strike.
These officials hold their proposal'Is
fair because- it grants the eight-hour
day for Which Mr. Wilson asked and
which, on the surface the brotherhoods
demand. It is pointed out that If the
brotherhoods get the eight-hour day
and refuse to arbitrate the wage end
of the proposition they will give the
lie to their declaration to the president
that this is a fight for the eight-hour
day and nothing else.
WOMAN SLAYS GUARD CAPTAIN.
Goes to Tent of Georgia Guardsman
and Shoota Him Twice.
Macon, Ga., Aug. 26.—Capt. Edgar J.
Sprattling of Company F, Georgia, was
shot/ and killed in his tent at the state

thing for me to da, and I did it. When
the testimony comes ou.t I reel sure the
public will be with me."
Mrs. Adams left her home in At

gone to work, leaying her and their
three children at home. She said last
