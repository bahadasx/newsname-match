In Spite of Owen's Determina

Adjournment Are Good.
PLANS ARE MADE TO
RUSH LEGISLATION
Representative Kitchen Sends
Out Call for Absent Mem
bers to Hurry Back for the
Final Offensive of House.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Aug. 25. Congress
is getting ready to adjourn next Fri
day, if possible, ignoring all threats
of members to press special bills over
protests of leaders.
It is expected that a jtrint resolu
tion to provide for. adjournment Fri
day evening will be submitted to both
houses next week as soon as the gen
eral deficiency appropriation bill has
passed the House pi'Jbably on Tues
day. Democratic leaders declare the
resolution will be adopted and that
this will operate to check a threaten
ed prolonged fight in the Senate over
the Owen Corrupt Practices Bill,
which aroused a fusilade of charges
and counter-charges of political cor
ruption yesterday.
Senator Owen's determination to
demand a vote on a motion to take
up the corrupt practices bill still
hangs tver the Senate but several in
fluential Democrats said today his
motion, if he got an opportunity to

seek another opportunity to pass the
immigration bill and he might got it
through if it could be done without
provoking debate. After the deficien
cy and revenue bills are passed, how
ever. Senate leaders on both sides sav
"wild h'jrses could not hold a quorum."
To clear the way for adjournment
Majority Leader Kitchin sent urgent
telegrams today to all house absentees
asking that they return at once for
the final legislative drive of the ses
sion. The House has the shipping
bill as amended and the revenue bill
conference report t'o dispose of next
week. The Senate is planning to lay
aside the revenue bill to pass the de
ficiency bill as soon as it gets through
the House.
"When that is done," said Senator
Simmons, chairman of the finance
committee, "all debate on the revenue
bill will halt and it will be rushed
thi'ough. In the meantime Senate
amendment to the House bill are be
ing informally considered with the
ways and means committee members
and final report will be ready as soon
as the bill reaches the House, to- be
sent to conference. With the revenue
bill passed. I do not think that any
thing can stjp adjournment of Con
gress unless something entirely unex
pected should develop."
If anything should happen to pre
vent adjournment next Friday it will
be necessary for Congress to
s'av i
over until the next following week,
as President Wilson will go t New
Jersey for his formal notification of
his nomination for re-election.

WASHINGTON". Aug. 25. The first
! clash of the session between so-called
old line and progrtssive Republicans
j occurred in the Senate today during
I debate on the emergency revenue
j bill. Senator Gallinger, the minority
; leader, criticized Progressive Repub
i Iicans for the overthrow of former
I Speaker Cannon and attacks on the
late Senator Aldrich, drawing a vig
orous reply from Senator Gronna.
Senator Gallinger declared that cer
tain Republicans who had sown seeds
of discontent over the Dingley tariff
chose former Speaker Cannon ns the
man on whom to heap the burden of
! blame and that they preached the
false theory that the high cost of liv
ing was due to the Dingley tariff.
Senator Gronna insisted that the tar-
had nothing whatever to do. with
the removal of Cannon and that he
las attacked only to end an era of
autocratic domination of tin; House,
He also hotly denounced inferences
that Progressive Republicans had at
that time demonstrated free trade
tendencies, and jcharged tnat Repub
licans of "the old guard" had sought
to subject the farmers of the country
to free trade in agricultural products.
Senator Gallinger predicted a re-
tariff law there was an increase
$S.nno,noO in imports and decrease of
$.14.000.000 in exports.
"Sugar factories closed down, or

Mr. Hughes spoke to an audience
that shivered in the cold right air
notwithstanding heavy wraps and ov
ercoats. The nominee was half an
hour late in starting his address. In
beginning he emphasized the fact
that he represented a reunited party.
"We have set aside our differences
in order that we may achieve our na
tional aims," Mr. Hughes said. These
aims are so high that they transcend
every possibility of difference. I
come as the spokesman of an historic
party, reconstructed to its best ideals
and pledged to the service of this
great nation at an extremely critical
time.
"The problems tht'we are facing
today are nofc exactly like those that
we have dealt w-ith in the past. We

tory. I do not think the world would
be the same world after the European
war that it was before.
"The upbuilding of American indus
try." he said, "lies at the very foun
dation of the future of the United
States. It can never be done under
an administration that bases its tar
iff for revenue only."

PARIS, via London. Aug. 23. The
Germans have made a new assault
on the French line at the tip of the
j famous salient of St. Mihiel, but have
been repulsed after gaining a footing
in French trenches, according to to
night's war office statement.
Apparently from the French state
ment the Allied troops do not plan an
advance on the right wing in Greece
as British cavalry detachments are
reported to have destroyed bridges
over the Angista River. .On the left
wing Paris reports "appreciable"
progress for the Serbians and the
capture of several hundred prisoners.
In the center where the main effort
of the Allies is expected, heavy artil
lery action is taking place but there
is no report of infantry operations.
The lull on the eastern front con
tinues but the renewed offensive by
. the Grand Duke Nicholas in Armenia
, is growing in extent.. The recent
fighting In the region of I-ake Van is
described in Petrograd as a crushing
blow to the Turks and Russian mili
' tary critics predict the resumption of
the Grand Duke's advance toward
Asia Minor.
I The usual period of comparative in
' activity has followed the western
front gains reported by Paris and Lon
don, is partially confirmed by Berlin.
The Germans have, however, attempt
I ed a new blow at the French at the
' point of the famous St. Mihiel salient.
' This salient juts far into the French
; line southeast of Verdun and has
been the scene of some of the bloodi
est fighting in France. The force of
the German blow carried them into
the French trenches but Paris says
they were immediately evicted by a
: counter attack.
I London again has been the target
. for a Zeppelin raid and. as usual, the
accounts issued by Berlin and Lon-
don conflict. Berlin claims that ttie
, British capital was heavily bombard
' ed by several naval dirigibles and that
batteries and vessels were struck.
. According to London only one of the
Zeppelins reached the outskirts-of the
j city and the material damage done
' was slight. Fight persons were kill

British version.

warning that their men would
L'jt wait longer than tomorrow
for a reply from the railroad ex
ecutives to President Wilson's sug
gestions, the executives tonight
agreed upon a counter proposal to
be submitted to the President
toraon'jw. This plan holding to
the demand for arbitration to
which the men are unalterably op
posed, proposes:
"That the question of an eight
hour day is not directly connect
ed with the matter at issue and
that there is a difference between
an actual eight hour day and an
eight h'jur day as basis for pay.
"That the present demands of
the trainmen be submitted to ar
bitration by the interstate com
merce commission or some board
to be created by the President or
in some other way.
"That if the arbitrating board
finds wage increases sh'juld b
granted their findings will not be
retroactive. s
"That a fund shall be created
by the railroads to provide for
this contingency, the interstate
conuiH Ti-e commission to keep the
accounts that will be necessary
and the arrangement to continue
in l.rce for a time not yet de
cided upon, the ineil agreeing
that during the period of arbitra
tion there shall be no further
demands nor any attempt to
strike."
A draft of the report was sub
mitted tonight by the committee
of eight presidents who have
been constantly at w'ork upon its
various phases for a week
There was some discussion, but
only one vote was taken and by
it the sixty presid-.-Vj aud man
agers approved the draft. Some
slight additions to the phraseolo-
gy are t'j be made and the final
draft presented at another meet
ing tomorrow. From that meet
ing the report is expected to be
taken to President Wilson. It
was said tonight this will be the
final proposal.
"It is squarely up to the men."
was the way one 'jf the presidents
put it The crisis in the situa
tion is expected by noon tomor
row, when the President has an
appointment to see the brother
hood leaders. Some of the ex
ecutives say that while the pro
posal would not give them more
than 20 per cent increase in wages
provided in effect in President
Wilson's plan It probably gives
an increase of over 10 per cent.
After the vote several of the ex
ecutives made suggestions, which
the ponimittee of eight pi'jbablr
will include in the final draft.
Throughout the discussion the
executives took the position that
the question of the eight hour
day was entirely one of wages
rather than 'jf principle. They
said tonight they never had voted
formally on President Wilson's
plan as a whole but that all of
their discussions had shown that
it could not be accepted In its
entirety. The plan now agreed

the executives since Kie negotia
