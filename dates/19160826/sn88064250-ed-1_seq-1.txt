GROSS VIOLATION OF LAW

Charles Thibodeaux
- The general public is disposed to
,forget or overlook matters of im
-portance after those matters have
sed t be "a nine days' wonder."
Starles Thibodeaux, agent of the
;iieservation commission, brings to
the. attention of the people, in the
Ioilowing open letter addressed to
Hdge Pavy and t.ie public, a cou
ole ofcases tried in the district
but of parties arrested by him
;r violation of the game laws.
,The communication makes interest
la reading and shows to What ex
flt stioe has gone in this section
of the state.
1t. . Thibodeaux states the case so
ctihctly and with such a direct
ize# and forcefulness that there is
Ibund to be some element of truth
Sit. The matter of accepting a
'i -of guilt, sentencing parties
der such plea, and then, after
aisding out that the entire trial has
een a farce, setting aside the judg
nt and refixing the case for an
r~e day, is so farcical that even
the merest tyro can see beyond the
ain veneer of partisanship and the
frect play to the galleries-in this
ease a direct bid for votes and po
iti support.
Iut where indicted parties--in
Tdon the. same charge-r-were
from another parish, the full meas
Rre of the law was meted out, and
i6ven the district attorney, accoIrd
ing to Mr. Thibodeaux, received a
fee of $2.50 from each of the guilty
;e of Lafayette, when, `asa mat-.
of fact, the district attorney
was not entitled o any fee what
ever, he having contracted with the
ce jury to receive a salary in
ed of fees n convictions before
e district court. To what end is
it il coming, and what will that
be?
S. Thibodeaux's4: Iele follows:
the Public andto Judge Pavy:
"The latter part. o aya, 1914, on
affidavit higned "by the late
h~eriff Swords, 1 ;arrested eleven
parties (nine from Eyangeline and
$wo from this parish) on a charge
t hunting without a license and
.illfg deer out of season.
"These parties were indicted by
hse grand jury on only one charge
h -iaunting without. a license-and
I arraignment in the district court
all pleaded guilty. The court im
a fine of $5 on each, includ
A1libe Bertrand, who possessed
te-wide license for which he
paid $10.
After imposing sentence on. all
es, the attention of Judge Pavy
called by me to the law cover
this case, which says that. for
ting without a license and kill
er out of season the minimum
* shall not be less than $25 and
t exceeding $100, or thirty days
iail in default of payment of fine
costs.
IAfter the Judge's attention *had
n called to the law, he instructed
clerk of court not to enter the
"and fine on the minutes and
edistrict attorney, Mr. Lee Gar
Srefixed the case for the fol
ng week, at which time all
en indicted parties were
tight into court and on arraign
i pleaded not guilty.
Tey were tried before the
e and the same witnesses for
lstate who testified before the
8 .jury returning the indict
also testified before the court
i't~i r1
the accused did not produce a sin
gle witness in their defense. TiI
COURT ACQUITTED TEN 0]
THEM AND CONVICTED ALIBI
BERTRAND-THE ONLY ONE 01
THE ELEVEN WHO POSSESSEI
A LICENSEI The minimum fine
of $25 was imposed by the court or
Bertarnd and'the other ten 'chippec
in' $2.50 each and paid his fine.
"The case is a matter of public
record, but the general public ma3
have forgotten its details.
"Now, Mr. Judge, are you incom
petent, or ignorant- of: th law, or
are you crooked.
"In either case you are not fit
or qualified to be judge.
"Now, Mr. Judge, what- are you
going to do--'plead ignorance, or
will you admit"that you entered in
to a crooked deal with the accused
parties in the case above set forth.
In either event you are unfit to be
judge of the district court, and the
sooner the people find it out and
retire you to the cooling shades of
private life the better off they will
be.
"Now, judge, there is another
case which is of more than local
interest. I refer to that in which a
party of three, headed by Elie
Breaux, from the parish of Lafay
ette, were arrested for'violating the
game law and hunting in this (St.
Landry) parish out of season and
without a license.
"In this particular case, as you
no doubt well know, the district
attoirney, Mr. Iee Garland, filed a
bill of information against thorn on
the eharge -of hunting in this pa -
ish without a liense. Ox4-irraigh
meat in court, before Youir Honor,
all three pleaded guilty of 'hunt
ing in this parish without a license.
You imposed a fine of $25 and costs
on each and the 'cost s 'amounted to
$10--$2.50 to tlhe sheriff, $2.50 to
the clerk of court and $5 to the dis
trictattorney.
"Is it not a fact, judge, that the
district attorney, -Mr. Garland, is
paid a salary bytthe parish 'for con
victions in all criminal cases' and is
therefore not entitled to any fees?
How will you and the district at
torney explaini this plain violation
of the law? -
"You, Mr. Judge, have IGNORED
THE LAW IN TRYING ACCUSED
PARTIES WHO WERE 'RESI
DENi OF YOUR DISTRICT, and
consequently. Ould: in :ah election
VOTE FOR. OR AGAINST YOU; hut
when parties FROM ANOTHER
PARISH OUTSIDE OF YOUR DIS
TRICT were tie..- and convicted
you Imnosed a .fine acooding to
lawl
"Now, how can you, Mr. Judge,
and you, Mr. District Attorney, ex
plain this blowing hot and blowing
cold-this playing Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde.
"And haven't you, Mr. District
Attorney, collected fees for con
victions wtich you were not en
titled to under your contract with
the police' jury of this parish."

Young Attorneys Continue To Meet

VICTORY POINTS TO
SANDOZ AND LEWIS
First Fight In St. Landry Parish
Staged Along Sound Lines And In
Which No Bitterness Appears.
While the candidates for district
judge and district attorney are all
busy going through St. Landry and
Evangeline the voters are daily be
coming more interested in the fight
which will bee culminated on the
12th of September.
For the first time in the history
of St. Landry parish.one campaign
for important offices is being waged
without bitterness being engendered
in the fight. It is true that both
sides are fighting as stubbornly as
possible, but this is one campaign
in which the mudslinging appears
tb have been discarded.
For those reasons, simply because
the fight is made along sound and
argumentative lines, Sandoz and
Lewis will ride in office on the 12th
of September. Because the people
of Evangeline and St. Landry have
dome to the conclusion that it is
competency which counts and not
the votes, in order to make a good
official.
John Lewis, the young aspirant
for district attorney, has been mak
ing a strong appeal to the young
voters of this district. He argues
that Lee Garland has been district
attorney for twenty years; that it
it high time $or the young voters of
the district to show their indepence,
which has repeatedly been shown in
the not too distant past.
Peyton R. Sandoz, in his same old
manner, has been going around the
district, making a t'horough canvass
of the two parishes, in which he has
always been very popular. The
voters know that he is compentent,
they know that he would make s~t
ideal judge, and for those reasons
they will march to the polls and
vote for the candidate of their
choice on the 12th of September.

Just before leaving fo Chicot
yesterday (Friday) morni Hon.
John W. Lewis of this cit candi
date for district attorney; iave out
the following interview a` address
to the peope of -hi..*'
My campaign is among the
people---right n their homes,
in their fields and places of
business. The papsuckers hand
grafters and politicians who
live off the people have al
wayS sought to crush me, have
always fought me, but happily
the day is past when a large
criminal docket, a long record
of inefficiency and a few sup
posed political janizaries can .
run this or Evangeline par
ishes.
"I am offering my hopes and
aspirations to the whole peo
ple, promising them a fearless
and efficient administration
of the district attprn ey's of
fice. Right here ih Opelou
sas, where I was born and
reared, where the people are
unbought and unbossed, where
men vote according to the dic
tates of judgment, I shall sub
mit my ease in due time. Let
Mr. Garland do the same
thing. Let him meet me here
in joint debate before our
people, where he, too, was
born and reared, and I shall
abide the result. I have no.
money to debauch the elee
torate, no docket, no super
serviceable parochial official
to hurry and scurry to and,
fro at my bidding, but I have
an abiding faith in the people
of this district, and whatever
they decide in this contest I
know will be in accordance
with right and justice. This
is all I can say at this time,
b1yt after my canvass of Evan
geline, which I complete this
week, I shall take up this par
ish. You - might inquire
whether twenty yieas in one
office is not :i noiugh, -nd
whether I ml :ntitled to a
chance--I have ter had one
in polities because the politi
clans would not stand forme."

Seventh District .Congressman Be
ing Supported Strongly In Oppo
nents' Judieial District
Dr.i Ladislas Laaro,; member of
the House of Representatives from
the seventh Louisiana district; is
meeting ,with success all along the
line, in hid campaign for reelection
according to reports received from
the four Calcasieu parishes.
A prominent Lake Charles lawyer
expresses the opinion that Dr.
Lazaro will receive a very flatter
ing vote right at Lake Charles, the
home of the two aspirants for
Lazaro's scalp. The St. Landry
man's friends claim that he will
carry St. Landry, Evangeline, Jet
ferson. Davis, Arcadia by over
whelming majorities and he has
a splendid e.ance of carrying other
parishes.
In St. Landry the fight in not con
sidered interesting from a stand
point of tightness, as the Grand
Prairie man will run away with both
of his opponents.
The reported ,ppposition to Dr.
Lazaro in the beginning of the cam
paign has faded away and it is now
apparent that ',e Will_ obtain the
practical solid suppurt of the voters
of the parishes of St. Landry, Evan
geline and Arcadia.
Dr. Lazaro returned oni Monday
night from Calcasieu and other
western parishes, where he was as
sured the same old support. He
went to Grand Prairie on Tuesday
to cast his vote in favor of the
school tax, which was held for the
purpose of erecting a school house
in the sixth ward, for the pupils of
the Sylvestre neighborhood.
Congressman Lazaro will continue
his tour of the other parishes, as
this local friends have advised him
not to lose any time, in this section i
of the district.

THE SONS OF THI DEAD
SHERIFF D .CINhE OFFER
Rev. Brock Is Thanked for His
Generous Offer to the Family of
Former Sherifft f St. Landry •
The many friends of the dead
sheriff thought it 'would be a fit
ting tribute to his memory to pay
off hs indebtedness on the beauti
ful Swords home. But the Swords
boys in the following communica
tion decline the offer:
New Orleans, La., Aug..22, i91
Dear Editor:
In the issue of your paper of Aug.
i9th, there appeared a letter signed
by our sincere frinl, the Rev. J. B.
Brock, solictiting contlributons from
friends of our deceased father, for
the purpose of liquidating a certain
eneumberance on our mother's
home. ]
This kind and thoughtful oonsi
derration is thoroughly n keeping
with the past evidence of the love
and'devotion that t.e people of Ope
lousas and St. Landry Parish have,
always shown for Marion Swords
and his family, and we would be
guilty of base ingratitude should we
fail to appreciate this mragnificent
loyalty.
Hs sons must respectfully decline
to accept, ton behalf of our Mother,
this kind and generous offer that the
letter in question proposes, for a
purely selfish reason, via:
It is, indeed, a proud privilege for
us to attempt to sme the daily
burdens of oar i iter;s pleasure
no greater eould WeT ve to do for
his wife, our. Moher, and his de
pendent, ones in -the same cheerful
and unselfish spirit as was his want;
to do, for there was never, nor ihl
there now, a more devoted, loving
and considerate parent.
To aid our Mother i hbut a duty-
and a pleasant one, and should his
loyal friends attempt, even in a
small' measure ti lessen the 're
,sponsibilities, which we .cheerfully
assume, it would, deprive his, sons
of a heartfelt. desire to showra
manly devotion for-.a most indut=I
gent father.
How can we betterdemonstrates
the affection and estee" , We pos.
sessed for him, than for rdoiig for
his t'Sat; whic he did for usl
We: beg the indulgence of Rev.
Brock, for whom We, hold the high
est esteem, as well as those who
actuated him in this thoughtful
consideration, but, we ask that we
be, allowed to care for our father's
widow and children, which is our
honorable and checrful privilege to
do.
The burden of our father's finan
cial condition falls where it rightly
and justly belongs; and nrot uopn
his many rfiends who have served
imn so long--they have done well
their part and it-remains for us to
do ours. For the honorable name
ha left his children, no greater
tribute could they pay his memory
than to be proud to possess it.
Although poor in worldly goods, he
was wealthy in honesty, eharity,
love, human tenderness and rugged
manhood,. We are proud of what
he was, and jealous of those who
might deprive us of the slightest
opportunity to fight his battles.
Kindly accept, friends of Marion
Swords, the spirit of this letter as
it is iitended.
Please, my dear Mr. Brock, feel
no offense becautise of ther contents
of this communication, when sin
cerely none is meant to our father's
friend, for it is but' a wish, a de
sire of devoted sons to serve, to the
best of their humble ability, th e
memory of a faithiful parent.
Sincerely and respectfully,
C. W. SWORDS,
ALEX. SWORDS,
M. W. SWORDS.
