There are citizens who believe that
It Is contrary to good public policy in
a free country to put too many ot the
public offices In ono community In
the possession of members of a single
family.
The threats made by members of
the Connery Gang to put The Eaglo
out of business impelled this news
paper to forret out just what grasp
the Connerys have on public affairs.
The result is startling and of In
terest to taxpayers, voters and the
public genorally.
No wonder somo of this gang of
public payroll ornaments believe that
they can use the United States Gov
ernment In their business.
They evidently have found the
State of Illinois,
County of Cook and
City of Chicago
Very profitable and easily worked
attachments to tho family possessions.
Democrats In Chicago aro wonder
lng why all of tho public jobs are not
given to Connery's.
It may be due to thejact that there
are not enough Connerys to go around.
Connorys First! ,
What a noble family motto that Is
to bo suro.
And often has tho Democratic party
fallen for tho Connorys and their well
known hankering for good things.
"State Street Store" Dlocki as you
may havo hoard him rotorred to, a
partner ot John T. Connery in the coal
business, is a member of tho Board
of Review.
William J. Connory, nephew of John
T. Connery, holds the nice-salaried
Job of Secretary of Reviewer Dlocki.
Partner Dlocki will run for re-election
next year, so prepare your bal
lots. Good stories ot city contracts and
of other contracts in which the Con
nery connections were alleged to have
been Interested are not so far forgot
ten that the public interest In them
ever wholly died out
There was a number ot talented
Democratic leaders who held office or
contracts under the Busse BUSINESS
administration.
We havo referred to some of these
worthies before as our flies will at
test. But talking ot the Busse BUSINESS
administration, Democrats do not for
get the party treason which brought
it about. .
Democrats do not forget the dose
that somo members of the Connery
gang gave Mayor Dunne in 1007 when
he was running for re-olection.
Although looked upon by many in
the light ot the Royal Family ot the
Democratic party, entitled to most,
it not to all, of the Jobs in its gift,
the Connery's are alleged to have
given such great support to Busse
and to have worked bo hard ot defeat
Dunne that Busso's gratltudo was
groat.
When John W. Ralnoy, always a
good Democrat and an able man, was
running tor Clerk of the Circuit Court
in 1012, the Connery outfit fought
him at the polls in favor ot Joseph
E. Bldwlll, Jr., a Republican.
When Robert M. Sweltzer-waa run
ning for the Domocratlo nomination
for Mayor in 1916, the Connerys saw
another chance to put a member ot the
family In that office and they trotted
out Francis D. Connery, thon City
Clerk and now Comptroller ot the
Sanitary District of Chicago.
But the Democratic stomach was
showing signs of balking at an over
diet of Connery and the noble Francis
D. was sent back to the payroll to
wait for another chance.
SwelUer got the nomination and it

MUCH FAMILY POLITICS
Is said that the Connery following
did not forgive him for crowding out
ono of the princes of tho blood and
were not ovor-onthuslastlc for Swelt
zer's election to say the least.
This year the Connery's are not
asking for much.
. It is reported that Joseph E. Bid
will, Jr., son-in-law ot John T. Con
nery will not seek Republican nomi
nation for Clerk of the Circuit Court
against John W. Rainey, the prosont
efficient Domocratlo Incumbent of that
office.
Joseph F. Connery, a brother of
John T. Connery and a brother ot
Francis D. Connery and an uncle-In-law
of Joseph E. Bldwlll, Jr., will seek
a renomlnatlon for Recorder of Deeds
Michael M. Connery, brother of
John T., Joseph F and Francis D.
Job as Inspector for Attornoy Gen
eral Lucoy.
Henry E. Connory, brother ot Mich
ael M. Connery, Joseph F. Connery,
John T. Connory and Francis D. Con
nery, and uncle of William J. Connery
and uncle-ln-law ot Joseph E. Bldwell,
Jr., will hold his present lucrative Job
as State Bank Examiner.
Francis D. Connery, brothor of Hen

John T. Connery and Michael M. Con
nery; undo ot William J. Connory
and unclo-ln-law of Joseph E. Bid

Sanitary District ot Chicago.
Stato Street Dlocki, tho business
partner of John T. Connery, will not
havo a chance to run again for his
present Job on tho Board ot Rovlow,
until next year.
So William J. Connory, nephew of
John T., Joseph F., Francis D., and
Michael M. Connery will retain his
nlce-sulared Job as Blockl's Secretary.
But by next year a few more of
fices may be created for a few more
Connorys as it would bo too bad to
have Block), John T. Connery's part
ner in the coal business running on
a ticket where there was not another
member of the Connery family to keep
him from getting lonosome.
Connory first the rest nowhere.

Tho publlo is naturally anxious to
know what personal proporty taxes
Its office holders pay. So much has
boon said about tho number of Con
nerys holding publlo office in Chicago
that many inquiries havo been mado
as to what personal property assess
ments are laid against these patriotic
persons by the Board of Assessors.
Tho printed lists or personal proper

lowing facts:

Tho circular winds up with this

Tho above circular circulated by
28th Ward Democrats at a recent pri
mary election only gives tho relatives
of Francis D. Connory, who is a broth
er of Rovlewer Blockl's partner, John
T. Connery; State Attorney General's
Investigator Michael M. Connery; Re
corder of Deeds Joseph F. Connery;

ant, William J. Connory: a brother
of Henry Connery, State Bank Exam
iner If all of tho office-holding relatives
of all ot tho other Connerys outsldo
of Francis D. Connory wero published
It would havo to be as a sorial. No
ono issue of tho paper could spare the
spaco for the names.
Chicago has had a surrelt ot bad
banks, and a bank under suspicion
should bo avoided by tho public. A
bank which allows its business policy
to bo shaped by a bank examiner Is a
Just object of suspicion. A bank that
is abovo suspicion has no fear of n
bank examiner or his Influence
somo very curious mistakes. It ap
pears from tho following received by
Tho Chicago Eaglo, August 7, 1016,
and postmarked samo date, that tho
official printed assessment roll for dis
trict No. 4, Lake View, which omitted
Mr. John T. Connery's name and as

How tho assessors could go north

and assess all of the above named

every reader of the printed list issued
by the assessors for District No. 4,

It is cortalnly an interesting subject
for publlo inquiry.
Tho Tribune with tho following re
sults: Ross C. Hall, representing tho
country towns, said:
"Our ticket will bo unbcatablo in
November after wo havo slated n
few Poles for tho Municipal court.
Tho city hall forces havo put up a

Wo'vo named n ticket of Irish and
