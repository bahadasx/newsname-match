The shipping bill provides for crea
tion of a government shipping board
to acquire and operate ships for re
habilitation of the American merchant
marine and appropriates fifty million
dollars for that purpose to be raiseti
by the sale of Panama canal bonds.
Several important amendments were
agreed to just before the final vote,
among them one by Senator Hoke
Smith. whien would reduce the salary
of the shipping board members from
$10,001, to $7.500 a year. Another by
Senator Fletcher would authorize the
president to seek adjustment of for
eizn discrimination against American
shipping through diplomatic negotia
tions and to take retaliatory action if
such negotiations fail. Another by
Senator Thomas would authorize the
treasury to withhold clearance from
masters of vessels who deliberately
refuse to accept freight from Ameri
can citizens without satisfactory rea
sons.
At the last minute vain efforts were
made by Senator Borah to attach the
immigration bill to the shipping meas
ure. He first offered an amendment
incorporating the literacy test section
in a provision to prevent the transpor
tation of aliens to American shores.
The amendment was voted down, 20
to 39. He then offered the entire im
migration bill as a rider and it was
rejected, 22 to 37.
