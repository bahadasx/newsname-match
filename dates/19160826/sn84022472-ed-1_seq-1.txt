BRIDGEPORT POLICEMEN
ENTERTAIN BIG CROWDS
AT BEACH OUTING TODAY
The big field day, given under the
auspices of the Bridgeport police de
partment for the benefit of the Police
Sick Benefit association, got under
way at Pleasure Beach at 2 o'clock
this afternoon. The explosion of a
dozen bombs, marking the opening ol
hostilities between the Tigers and Ma
jors on the baseball field, announced
to the city that the big doings had
started.
Thousands of Bridgeporters and' vis
itors from neighboring cities, were at
the Beach when the series of explo
sions greeted the umpire "Play Ball!"
Thousands more were on their way to
the resort, and indications were that
nightfall would see the biggest crowd
on record present at the Beach.'
Reports at press hour were that the
hall game was doing as well as could
expected, and the thousands ox
pleasure seekers were enjoying them
selves. Bridgeport Is today the Mecca for
policemen from all sections of the
state and at noontime a person
scarcely could move on the streets in
the center of the city without rubbing
elbows with a guardian of the peace
from some part of the state. The
bluecoats, in many instances, were ac
companied by other members of their
families. Delegations from New Ha
ven, Hartford, Stamford, Norwalk,
New London, Waterbury and other
cities arrived by automobile and train
all morning long. . Everyone was ex
pecting a good time and at the beach
they all jenjoyed it.
. Police headquarters presented j a
hustling appearance all morning as
police officers called at the station to
renew old acquaintances. Veterans of
the old days, now bent and worn with
age and on the retired lists, plodded
their way to the building In Fairfield
ave'ftue and appeared as satisfied and
happy as the younger men who have
taken their places. Old timers who
had not seen each other in many
years were there and were greatlj
pleased to meet ach other. And all
looked forward with keen anticipation
for the celebration this afternoon.
The baseball game at 2 o'clock be
tween the teams from headquarters
and the second precinct station start

Seeking Separations
Four local residents filed divorce

ploded on signal from Captain Charles
H. Suckley. As the bombs exploded
flocks of birds appeared to be flying
directly over the island and the
crowds gathered about the ball field
and cheered lustily. The novelty of
the paper birds floating in the air was
new to practically everyone present
and was only one of the many sur
prises attendant upon the outing.
Following the baseball game the
trak events were held on the speed
way and interested many as the nim
ble footed minions of the law did their
beet to show their heels to rivals.
The fat men's race proved very in
teresting and many a hearty laugh was
exacted by the chariot and wheelbar
row races. In the former, two po
licemen as the horses on chariots
loaned by Barnum & Bailey's circus,
drew brother officers and the stories
of the old Grecian races were recalled
as the cops took the turn on the last
lap.
Under the direction of Lieutenant
Charles A. Wheeler, the traffic squad
adequately handled the traffic going
to' the beach and at the foot of Sea
view avenue many hundreds of auto
mobiles were parked. The Lake
property was also utilized as a park
ing place and proved of much "advan
tage to the autoists. All vehicles re
turning from the beach were sent up
Newfleld avenue at the fcorner of Sea
view avenue, thus relieving much of
the traffic in Seaview avenue.
At noon today the east bound trol
ley track over Tellow Mill bridge
which has been closed, was opened
by the contractors wdrklng on the
bridge and much of the delay in trol
ley traffic that would otherwise be
encountered, was obviated.
The speed motor boat "Humpty
Dumpty," under command of De
tective John Flynn, comprised the
police water squadron and was plying
between the beach and the Stratford
avenue bridge during the afternoon.
The officials and the traffic men were
taken to the island in the boat.
Tonight at 9 o'clock the biggest dis
play of fireworks ever exhibited in
this city, will be sent up from the
knoll near the east end of the beach.
Thirty-five pieces comprise the display
which will last an hour.

M'NEILS AFTER
WHITNEY TRACT
FOR COAL YARD
Would Pay About $75,000
For Six Acres If Tracks
Are Permitted.
WANT ALDERMEN
TO RATIFY PLAN
Details of Mysterious Pur
chase Becomes Known in
Realty Circles.
Details of the proposed sale of a six
acre tract between North Washington
avenue and the Pequonnock river,
owned by Mrs. Mary F. Whitney,
which hitherto has been attended
with much mystery, became known to
day. .
The Intending purchaser is The Ar
chibald McNeil & Sons Co., wholesale
and retail coal dealers, who plan to
erect on thePequonnocki river coal
pockets to supplant those they occupy
at present on property recently sold
by Frank Miller to the Salt's Textile
Co. The McNeil corporation leased
the pockets from Miller several years
ago when it bought Miller" coal bus
iness. Many conjectures as to the identity
of the persons back of the petitions
for .permission to lay railroad tracks
in streets in the vicinity of the prop
erty have, been hazarded during the
last two months, during which nego
tiations have been carried on. All the
parties in interest either have refused
to disclose, or have professed ignor
ance of their identity.
With a view to obviating the oppo
sition that has arisen to the several
plans already outlined as to linking
the waterfront property with the Berk
shire division of the New Haven road,
Mary F. Whitney has prepared for the
common council another petition.
This will ask for tlje right to extend
a spur track, for which permission al
ready has "been granted to the Stand
ard Mfg. Co., through private prop
erty owned by Henry F. Parrott,
brother of Mrs. Whitney, across ITorth
Washington avenue, at grade, into the
six acre tract which the McNeils In
tend to purchase.
The property to the north of this
tract is owned by the Naugatuck Val
ley Ice Co. It is hounded on the west
by North Washington avenue, and the
south by Wakelee street. It has a wa
terfront of about 450 feet.
The selling price, conditioned upon
the city's granting to the petitioner
the right to lay the desired track, is
fixed at approximately $75,000.

CHILD MORTALITY
HERE DECREASED,
ASSERTSSOPHIAN
Thinks Precautionary Meas
ures Have Saved Lives of
Many Children.
The infant mortality for Bridgeport
this summer must have dropped be
low the reqord of other years, accord
ing to Dr. Abraham Sophlan, despite
the epidemin of infantile paralysis.
Dr. Sophian bases his belief on the
record for New Tork, where it has
been found a big drop has been taken
in the number of infant deaths. If this
is the case in New York, he argues, it
must he here in greater measure, be-,
cause the greatest sanitary precau
tions have been taken most of the
summer.
"This should be a lesson to the peo
ple," said Dr. Sophian, "to continue in
operation the measures they have
adopted for better sanitation."
Many of the same conditions that
make for the spread of infantile par
alysis cause other diseases among chil
dren. That the removal of these has
been effective, Dr. Sophian believes. Is
demonstrated by the greater number
of cases in New Haven, for Instance,
than in Bridgeport, and the number
in Stamford and other cities in pro
portion to their populations.
Bridgeport hasn't had a new case
of infantile paralysis since Wednes
day. .Continuation of the sanitary
measures will help the epidemic to
die out. Dr. Sophian urges.
Because of the freedom of the city
from cases in the last few days.
Bridgeporters should not become too
confident and relax their precautions,
says the epidemiologist, nor should
the quarantine against other cities be
abandoned for this reason.
"The fact that we are enjoying a
comparative freedom from the di
sease," he says, "does not mean that
other places are. For this reason we
should protect ourselves against the
possibility of the germs being carried
here from other towns and cities."
Gossip about the city that police
men and nurses at the entry points
have not been as careful recently as
they were when the epidemic broke
out has caused Dr. Sophian to issue
a warning that the vigilance be main
tained strictly.
Plans for a concert tomorrow to be
given by children of 12 years and.
younger. of Hungarian parentage,
have been dropped. Dr. Sophian In
formed the promoters that the rec
ommendation against congregating
children have not been revoked. A
Hungarian picnic has been postponed.
Before he leaves Bridgeport, Dr.
Sophian proposes to put himself
frankly on record in a complete re
port detailing how he thinks a city
the size of Bridgeport should be con
ducted, from a sanitary standpoint.
He will make recommendations for its
future. i

Situation Takes on Added Intensity and Outlook
For .Amicable Settlement Becomes Doubtful
Employes' Leaders Say Men Cannot Be Held
Much Longer Executives Formulate Counter
Proposal Which They Say Will Be Their Last
Workers Will Stand Firm For Eight-Hour i
Day.
Washington, Aug. 26 The threatened railroad strike took
on added tensity today as the railway executives continued their
deliberations over the form of their counter-proposal to Presi
dent Wilson's plan and the brotherhood leaders awaited the next
move.
The executives have been told that the men's leaders expect
difficulty in restraining them after tonight. The Presidents .
worked steadily all morning and forepart of the afternoon care
fully preparing their statement to President Wilson but shortly !
after noon had taken no final vote on it.
As has been outlined unofficially it declined to concede the
eight-hour day without arbitration' and investigation of its ap.
plication to railroading, but makes some concessions as to col
lateral issues.
The effect of the executives' counter-proposal will be to
pass the issue back to the brotherhoods and the outlook is vari
ously described by those in touch with the negotiations. :
Some of the railway executives say fective from the time arbitration be.
their proposition is positively their I gins and a fund would be established
last; some of the men's leaders stand
firmly against arbitration. Others on
both sides have hopes that out of it
will come further negotiations delay
ing a strike and possibly averting it.
A statement issued by the federal
bn.ird of mediation today on the set
tlements it had conducted was re
garded as significant. It described a
report about to be made to the Senate,
which will disclose that in every case
of settlement conducted under the old
Erdman Act or the later Newlands
law substantial advantages have been
won by the employes through arbitra
tion. The only instance recorded
where the the men did not benefit was
a settlement made without the par
ticipation of the federal mediators.
President Wilson regards the situa
tion as serious but has not given up
hope of a settlement He will con
tinue to use every effort to . bring
both sides together.
Secretary Lane, formerly a .mem
ber of the Interstate commerce com
mission, has kept in close touch with
the negotiations and conferred today
with the President.
The railroad executives met early
today to perfect the draft of their
proposal and were expected to send it
Immediately to President Wilson who
had an engagement with the brother
hood leaders about noon.
The railroad presidents contend for
arbitration on the ground that an
eight-our day basis sought by the
brotherhods Is actually a question of
wages rather than of working hours,
and consequently is properly subject
to arbitration.
Further, they propose that if the
arbitrating board, which might be the
Interstate commerce commission or
some other public body to be created,
finds wage increases should be grant
ed, the order would be considered ef-
TERRIFIC "SEA BATTLE"
RAGING OFF SANDY HOOK
IN BIG NAVY WAR GAME
Youth Arrested Here
Will Answer Serious
Charge In Peekskill
Waiving extradition, Samuel Scivel
lito, 18 years old returned to Peeks
kill, N. T., today in company with
Deputy Sheriff Charles F. Lint of
White Plains and Detective Sergeant
Henry Burke of Peekskill. He Is
wanted in Peekskill on the charge of
abducting a girl from another part of
New York state.
Scivellito was arrested by the New
York officers and Detective Frederick
Feeley yesterday afternoon at Lexing
ton and Washington avenue as he was
going to the boat to make his get
away. During the last week he has
changed his living quarters three
times to evade the police.
Before returning with Scivellito,
Sergeant Burke praised the detective
department in this city and stated that
the capture of Scivellito, mainly
through the work of the local bureau,
was a source of much gratification to
the New York authorities who have
been seeking Scivellito for some time.

by the railroads to insure such bad
payments.
This answer of the railroad execu
tives would amount to partial rejec
tion of President Wilson's compromise
plan whereby the railroads Were to
concede the eight-hour day and all
other questions in dispute were o be
arbitrated. Some members of the
brotherhood committee, although still
hostile to arbitrating the eight-hour
demand, were said to favor taking the
railroads' proposal under advisement
and continuing negotiations next
week. '
Brotherhood- leaders had received
no official advices regarding the rail
road presidents' proposition when the
regular daily meeting of the employes
Committee convened. The work
men's committee planned to remain
in continuous session until they heard
from President Wilson who had prom
ised them some word by noon.
The brotherhood heads went into
session early this morning to consider
the unofficial report of the railroads'
proposition which they had obtained
from newspapers. They had receiv
ed no word from the White House and
did not expect to confer with the
President, they said, until after he had
received a delegation from the rail
road executives. Opinion wasi divid
ed among the employes as to how the
railroads' proposal would be receiv
ed. None of them thought that it
would be accepted without qualifica
tion, and a large number of them de
clared that if the railroads continued
to Insist upon arbitration a strike in
evitably would follow. Many of the
men planned to leave for their homes
tonight. A suggestion frequently
heard was that the committee of 640
be permitted to go home immediately
and the negotiations he left entirely in
the hands of the brotherhood heads.
Washington, Aug. 26 The Red and
Blue fleets have been engaged in bat
tle, the culmination of the navy war
game, since S o'clock this morning,
off Scotland Lightship, Sandy Hook.
Up to noon, by the umpires' decision,
the battleships Nevada and Texas and
the destroyers Wadsworth and Tucker
of the enemy fleet, the scout cruiser
Birmingham and the destroyers Ben
ham, Fanning, Balch, Drayton and
several others of the Blue defending
fleet had been lost in action.
The battle will continue until S -o'clock
this afternoon unless the um
pire, Read Admiral Knight, decides
one fleet or the other has been de-1
cisively defeated before that time. The
battle is being fought with every man
of each ship's company at his proper
station, but the firing is done with the
small calibre batteries. They are one
pounder guns mounted upon the 12
and 14-inch weapons of the main
batteries so arranged that the sighting
is done through the use of the me
chanism of the big guns.
"Whatever the outcome," declared
Rear Admiral Benson, chief of naval
operations, today, "it has been an ex
cellent maneuver. The department
is well satisfied so far as its informa
tion now goes, with the way its plans
have worked out."
The Red transports with the in
vading army, which Admiral Mayo,
commanding the hostile fleet, appar
ently was seeking to land in the vi
cinity of New York, was reported as
laying off Ambrose Light near Sandy
Hook. Whether the ships could pro
ceed depended on the outcome f
