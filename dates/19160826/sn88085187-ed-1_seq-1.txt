WASH IXC-TON, I>. C,
A ut. "o.—Tlie ■ 11ni;n in the
railroad strike situution
seems imminent.
Tlie strike question may be
decided before nlKht.
The president of the greatest
Aiiiericnn railways argued for
hours preparing counter propo
sals. They will present the prop
osition to Wilson whenever it is
completed.
Wilson postponed meeting the
brotherhoods until after receiv
ing the railroads' final declara
tion. He conferred with Secre
tary Lane today.
* The trainmen's representatives
met for one hour. Afterward
many of them paid their hotel
bills and prepared to leave Wash
ington.
They determined to refuse the
• railroads' propositi.
They believe negotiations are
near an end.
Tlie session of the trainmen ad
journed shortly after noon. They
carefully considered arbitration,
but took no action.
"We are ready," was the state

DANGEROUS FIRES
SURROUND TACOMA
Timber fires on all sides of
Tacoma threw a heavy pall of
Binoke over the city Saturday.
Steamship navigation on Puget
Sound was handicapped by the
fog-like haze, and many passen
ger boats traveled under slow
bell, to avoid accidents.
Reports indicated that the en
tire city is surrounded by fires in
timber and brush. Up to noon
Saturday no serious damage had
been reported.
Although It gained threatening
proportions Friday afternoon, the
mile-square forest fire between
Lemons beach and Regents park
was prevented from spreading to
ranches and settlements. Only
heroic work by settlers and dep
uty fire wardens saved the homes.
Appeals to The Times.
Late Friday afternoon Mrs. T.
Drumm of Urumms station, on
the old Steilacoom line, made a
frantic appeal to The Times for
- help.
"The fire Is gaining on us," she
■aid. "All the available men are
fighting it, but they can't seem
to stop it from coming on. Our
ranch and the homes of others
•re in danger of being wiped out
every minute. We have appealed
' to the city and county authori
ties and can't get any help."
The Times immediately
notified Chairman Slayden
of the honrd of county riim
nitssloners. Within 20 min
utes a fire warden and crew
of flre-fißhters was on Its
way to the threatened sec
tion. Their timely arrival
- Was all that saved the homes,
they declared.

etl between former Commis
sioner of s,ii«.t> A. IT. Mill*
nnd the l-'oss Itoat company
Inst year for a "municipal
fire boat."
Commissioner Pettlt today de
clared that the city was hooked
mi a live-year contract, by which
it must pay $:!,400 a year for
rental of the "fire boat," but
that tin- taxpayers were not get
ting a cent of value for their
money.
A serious omission in the con
tract, which permits the boat to
be used for any other purposes,
so long as it U within the govern
ment boundaries of the harbor, la
the cause of tlie city's loss.
The fire boat is nothing more
than a large launch with a high
power turbine engine Installed in
it. There is no doubt that tho
engine nnd pump are splendid
pieces of machinery, and that tho
boat would be an effective means
of saving waterfront property
from damage, if it were on hand
at all times to answer alarms.
Handle Private Huslness.
"Hut the boat is usod every day
to turn Seattle steamer about In
the city channel, and it la almost
constantly handling private busi
ness of the Fobs company," aald
l'ettit today.
"Frequently It tows logs
far up the Puyallup river. If
nn alarm of fire were turned
in during any of these occa
sions, It would he from 10
minutes to an hour before
the boat could he even noti
fied of the .llm in
"I have carefully Investigated
the contract that Mills drew up
last year, and It is full of holes.
The owners of tho boat do not
have to keep the craft tied up,
ready to answer alarms at a mo
ment's notice.
There Is nothing in the contract
to demand It. We cannot pre
vent them from using the boat for
tiny purpose that they want to.
"If I can find any legal excuse
for It, I intend to cancel that con
tract. The city la paying $200 a
montli rental and getting ln re
turn no assurance that the boat
will be on hand to extinguish
fires."
Pettlt and Fire Chief Carlson
made preparations Saturday to
install fire hydrants and water
mains along the east side of tho
city channel, behind the Fransioll,
John il. Stevens and International
Fisheries warehouses and the new
ship-building plant.
At present there is no water in
this neighborhood, and ln case of
fire the department would either
have to draw salt water from the
harbor, at a great Inconvenience,
or lay hose for more than 1,000
feet.
"I have found several other
places in the city's manufactur
ing district where the city has
made no provisions to furnish ade
quate rtre protection," said the
commissioner.
