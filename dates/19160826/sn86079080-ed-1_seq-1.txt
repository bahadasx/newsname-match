Police Jury Organism
ce Hart Members Refuse To Attead
Special Woetleg.
,e The police jury met at the
id Courthouse Thursday pursuant
le to a special c:all made by the
three members affiliated with
the Berthelot faction for the
purpose of organizing and taking
up any other business coming up
at the meeting. Present: Messrs.
Prudent G. Songy, Placide Barr4
and Fernand Reynaud. Absent:
e AMessrs. Augustin Lasseigne and
, Pierre Cassagne.
The absent members represent
d Id by their attorney, Mr. Gautier I
e had the proceedings taken down r
n by a stenographer. When the j
Smeeting was called to order Mr. a
Gautier handed to the members
t present a communication signed
by the two absent members and it
also by Mr. Babin protesting a- lt
..ainst the holding of the special tl
meeting on various grounds a- I
mong which may be mentioned, 2
first, that a meeting cannot be 2,
called by three members of the
Police Jury (yet the three protes b
tqrs called a special meeting of r4
their own sometime ago and ,s
pretended to organize 01
and dished out the
money of the parish at random);
second, that they could not an
swer the special call and attend
the meeting because Messrs.
Songy and Barre had enjoined ai
them from meeting as members
of the Police Jury. These gentle
men or their .ttorney have evi
dently nor read the petition in
that injunction suit. As we un- e
derstand it the injunction simply
restrained the Lasseigne-Cas- th
sagne-Babin Police Jury from m
carrying out any of the illegal
acts done at their pretended
meeting: it certainly did not aim
to prevent the duly qualified
members from sitting in the fu
ture on the Police Jury. The com
munication goes on to say that
the appointment of Mr. Fernand he
Reynaud as member from the p
first ward was illegal yet the
signers took no steps at all to
prevent Mr. Reynaud from sit
ting as a member of the Jury. As
we view it, the whole communi
cation was simply a pOOr at
tempt t, scare the bona fide and
duly qualified members of the
Police Jury from meeting and pe
accomplishing the objects em- Di
braced in the call.

Wihen :the timeget fr" te :acc
Lag of the Parish Co:ni' t2e h-d
arrivel Hlion. Paul Berthelot. chair
man of the old Committee, called
the meeting to order and Mr.
James V. Chenet, claiming the
same official title, attempted to
assame the duties of the chair.
.Mr. Berthelot, in a lengwthy and
e'aborat_ statement, explained
that the Committee of which he
s the present chairman had met
: nd organized; that such organiza
: o was effected after the other
i emtubers had been repeatedly
] ified to attend and they had
r,'rsistently refused so todo; that
.t was necessary at that time tor
"e Committee to meet and
choose de'egates to the State Con
ention; that the State Conven
ion placed its stamp of approval
Ipon said organization by re
c)gnizing the delegates sent to
Baton Rouge by his Committee
and rejecting those sent by the
2henet Committee.
Mr. Chenet claimed title to the
"hairmanship through an
organization recently effected by
the six members of his committee
:n the next breath he attacked the
'.erthelot organization on the
hround that six members did not
:onstitute a quorum and could
out legally organize.
Mr. Berthelot sugg,,sted- in
:ine with r. Chenet's argument
tiat both organizations be con
sidered illegal for the purpose of
this meeting in order that peace
and1 harmony might prevail es
pecially in the drawing of corn
missioners and clerks of election
for District candidates; that it
wvould be fair for both sides to let
the two chairman and the two
secretaries sit and make the neces
sary notifications to the Secretary
of State, etc;or that it would
likewise be fair to elect some
other members as chairman and
'ecretary protenl.
These reasonable suggestions
fell upon deaf ears because 'chair
nan' Chenet and his associates
nad evidently determined to 'rule
or ruin.'
In consequence, both committees
Held separate sessions, passed up
on notifications of candidacy filed
with their respective chairman
and selected separate sets of corn
missioners and clerks of election.
It is indeed regrettable that the
members of the Chenet comn.
mittee saw fit to make themsel.
ves the stumbling blocks in the
way of a harmonious meeting.
