Mr. Meffert Will Give Solid Encouragement to
Manufacturers
OFFERS VALUABLE LANDS
Comes now Mr. J. M. Meffert, al
ways public spirited and a booster for
Ocala and Marion county, who says
that, to any party who will establish
a new factory here, he will give, as a
site for the same, a part of his lands
south of the city, on the main lines
of the Seaboard and Coast Line rail
ways.
The Star learns of this generous
offer through the real estate firm of
Savage & Murray. The lands owned
by Mr. Meffert are among the very
best in the county, and that means in
the state. He will give five acres of
these lands to anyone who will erect
on the five acres a $5,000 plant; and
he will donate to five employes of the
plant one acre of land each, if the five
employes erect on the acre a house
costing not less than $700.
To larger factories Mr. Meffert will
give larger sites. He will give a 10
acre site -to a $10,000 plant, and one
acre each to ten employes of such
plant, provided each employe erects a
house costing not less than $700. To
still larger enterprises, he will give
proportionately larger sites. As soon
as the plants are built, Mr. Meffert
will give a warranty deed to the builders.
New industries will have no diffi
culty finding a good location in Ocala.
Other property owners have in the
past made generous offers of sites.
y When, recently, a site was being
sought for the state industrial school
for girls, Ocala property owners came
forward with offers of land. The
state, however, bought a site just east
'of the city, and there work will start
shortly on the buildings for the
buildings for the school. Plans are
being prepared ,and as soon as com
pleted bids will be asked for.
L. R. Trammell, secretary of the
board of trade, is gathering data on
the various plans for promoting new
industries that are being used with
success in a number of the large cities
of the country.
PRESIDENT OF AUTO CO.
SAYS INDUSTRY IS SAFE !
Walter E. Flanders Gives Vital Sta
tistics to Show Great Field
Left for Motor Cars
Frequently the fear is expressed
that the market is becoming glutted
with automobiles, that the time is not
far distant when the supply will be
far ahead of the demand, and that the
great motor car industry, upon which
many thousands of persons are de
pendent for support, . will stagnate
and wither from its present proud
eminence.
That such conditions are groundless
and are not based on the actual con
ditions in this country, is the state
ment of Walter E. Flanders, presi
dent and general - manager of the
Maxwell Motor company, who backs
up his belief ' with a series of vital
statistics that a r eof interest to the
entire industry. These statistics show
conclusively that doubting Thomases
who are making dire predictions of
the future of the automobile are
speaking without a knowledge of the
real situation, or if they have that
knowledge, they . are ignoring : the
facts.
"There is a very good reason for
the increased production in the Max
well factories," said Mr. Flanders.
"That reason lies in the fact that
there are at least 3,000,000 owners of
homes and 4,000,000 farmers in this
country who are not owners of motor
cars and who are natural prospects.
(This takes no account of hundreds of
thousands of home renters who are
well able to buy the kind of a motor
car they desire). There you have a
minimum of 7,000,000 who will buy
cars within the next four years. Tins
Tneans that 1,750,000 will buy each
, year. '-

OCALA HOUSE DINING
ROOM WILL OPEN
Messrs. Bennett and Temple are
very busy today, trying to have their
dining room ready to open tomorrow.
The dining" room will be nevt to the
lunch room, and between it and the
railroad station. It is a spacious and
airy room, the front opening on the
street and the rear on the Ocala
House garden, and with good fans
will be cool even on the hottest days.
The dining room will be elegantly
fitted up and a permanent institution.
It will cater to home folks, and at
the same time will be a place' where
visitors can always obtain a good
meal at moderate cost.
Bennett and Temple try hard and
know how, and they are obtaining the
business. " -
country. Tneir average income last
year was $1,552. Of this number,
1,000,000 now own cars." This leaves
4,000,000 farmers unsold.
"Approximately 3,000,000 cars are
owned and used in the United States.
The life of the average car is five
years. A man who has once owned a
car will never be without one. That
statement will stand with but isolated
exceptions. Assuming that the life of
a car is five years, then the annual
re-order market is twenty per cent or
600,000 cars yearly.
"With the yearly market 1,750,000
and the present re-order market 600,
000, the total present annual market
is 2,350,000.
"You cannot gethehind the figures.
There is a good, healthy market for
motor cars and there is no immediate
prospect of it diminishing. The social,
business, agricultural and economic
value of the automobile is generally
admitted by our population, both
uiban and rural. With each individual,
it is merely a question of the most
convenient time for him to buy."

them without qualifications.
