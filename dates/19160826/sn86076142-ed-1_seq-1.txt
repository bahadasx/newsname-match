PRESIDENT WILSON APPEALS f OR URGENT LEGISLATION
Government May Operate
Railroads by Special Law
Is Rumored in Capital
I Br Aaaorlatcd Pma.)
WASHINGTON, AugUHt 26. Presl
dent WUhoii went to Die capitol this
morning presumably In connection
with the railroad strike situation.
While at his office in the capitol he
summoned Democratic Leader Kern
and Chairman New-lands, of the Sen
ate Commerce committee, who have
charge of legislation in the Senate
affecting interstate railroads. The
trip was wholly unexpected and no
arrangements were nutde for his re
ception. Although It was known
that he came to discuss legislation
having a bearing on the threatened
strike, his spool He purpose was kept
secret. When he finished his con
ference with Kern and Newlunds the
president came to the door of his
office and said: "1 came here on
certain matters of legislation. That
is id I 1 can suy now." Then he re
lurried to the White House without
any further explanations of his visit.
Ncwlamls said positively that no
Joint session of Congress had been
arranged.
Later it was learned at the capitol
that the president told the senators
that the railroad executives had "put
It up to him" to obtain some guar
antee from Congress that they be
permitted to get more revenue to
meet the increased wages. He said
no means of accomplishing that end
was agreed upon.
Kern and Newlunds. after a can
vuhs of the congressional situation,
concluded it was feasible to pass
before adjournment an amendment
to the pending bill to Increase the
membership of the Interstate Com
merce commission and authorizing
the railways to Increase rates and
provide machinery for the arbitration
of future disputes, possibly similar to
the Canadian commission.
Before the president's capitol visit
the brotherhood leaders. Impatient
over the delay of the railroad execu
tives in replying to the president's
proposal, declared that only the un
qualified concession of eight hours or
some action by Congress to cause
the government to operate the rail
roads could prevent a strike.
The president's visit to the capitol
was taken aa an indications that the
situation had reached a crisis.
The rail executives late this after
noon adjourned without completing a
statement to the president and their
attitude is announced as unchanged.
