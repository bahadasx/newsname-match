STATE INSTITUTIONS.
Being one of a series of 12 spe
cial articles for the Examiner,
prepared by W. H. Cociiran, mem
ber of the state board of control.
Among all of the institutions ot
the state perhaps the least interest
ing, from a morbid curiosity view,
are the two homes the state has pro
vided for the veterans of our wars
and their wives and widows. The
homes are filled with those who have,
in times past, served their country,
and those who have wives are per
mitted, in one of the institutions, to
have them with them. In that insti
tution widows of old soldiers are per
mitted to reside. Complete harmony
prevails in the homes and the mem
bers, as a whole, are orderly and
obedient and nearly all appreciate
the comfortable homes provided for
them by the loyal state of Washing
ton.
Among so many old men many are
victims of physical ailments and need
constant medical care. With the
ages of the members ranging from
67 to 93, we must necessarily expect
that many will be called to a higher
home before long. We emphasize
the home ideal as much as possible
and give only such attention as pro
priety would suggest to the military
feature thereof. They are intended,
primarily as homes for old men, who,
as a matter of fact, have been civil
ians during the past half-century,
and to whom their military service is
a distant memory. We endeavor to
give as much variety to the life of
the homes as we can, and for this
reason have encouraged plays and
picture shows from time to time.
We have made the grounds outside
the homes attractive and the inside
of the homes sanitary and pleasant.
To be the head of either one of our
institutions for the old soldiers is not
the most pleasant position obtain
able. Wliile the members, as a
whole, are orderly and obedient, yet
there are those who are not so easy
to govern. It therefore requires a
great deal of patience on the part of
the commandant and the matron of
these homes, and many of the situ
ations are trying, to say the least. It
is necessary to treat all on an equali
ty and favoritism must be shown to
none.
All applications for admission
must be first sent to the superintend
ent of either one of the homes, to
gether with discharge or pension cer
tificate, and no applicant can be ad
mitted until his or her application
is approved by the Board of Control.
To be eligible for membership the
applicant must give proof that he or
she it a citizen of this state and has
been a bona fide resident of the state
for at least three years prior to dato
of application. No person havins
$1000.00 or more in money or in
property, or both, is eligible for
membership, unless by special per
mission of the Board of Control.
No person will be admitted or re
tained who is insane, an imbecile, or
who is infected with a contagious dis
ease. No married couple can be ad
mitted unless they were married
prior to the year 1905. No furloughs
are granted for a longer period than
six months. At the end of twelve
months' continuous absence on fur
lough or otherwise the names of such
absentees will be stricken from the
rolls.
All members of either home are
required to conduct themselves at all
times in a gentlema-nly, soldierly and
orderly manner and to observe strict
courtesy towards the officers and
toward one another. They must dis
charge such duties and such fatigue
work of not less than one hour each
day, except Sunday, as may be re
quired of them. Refusal to perform
such work or duty as may be assign
ed to him or her, disobedience of
orders, disturbance of the peace,
boisterous and vulgar language, dis
respect to the officers, or conduct
either in the homes or outside that
would be prejudicial to the discipline
or the management of the*home, in
toxication, or the bringing of Intox
icating liquors on the grounds, shall
be punished by summary discharge
or furlough under order of the super
intendent or by an order not to leave
the grounds for thirty days or let**.
The intoxicating liquor problem
was, before the prohibition law went
into effect, a serious one, but since
that law has prevailed a vast differ
ence is readily seen. And no one en
joys this pleasure more than those
members of the home who were not
addicted to Its use. And even thos*
who formerly spent their pension
money for liquor now enjoy the
change, which permits them to pur
chase more useful and beneficial
things.
All members of the homes must
bathe at leant once each week and
keep their rsomi and beds clean and
neut.
Whenever the superintendent of
tlic home is satisfied that any mem
ber I.as sufficient ability or means to
support himself, he may report such
case, and with the approval of the
Hoard of Control, may discharge
inch member.
Smoking is not allowed in any
■leaping rooms and no matches are
allowed to be kept in sleeping rooms.
At tattoo all members and employes
shall retire to their quarters and at
tapa all lights in the rooms will be
extinguished.
clothing is furnished by the state
to all members and tobacco Is furn
ished to those who get no pensions.
Earn home has its library and
billiard rooms. In this connection it
perhaps would- cause no harm for me
to suggest to the newspapers about
the state, both daily and weekly, that
it might be a very gracious act for
those who have not already done so,
to place each home on their mailing
list, as there are members in each
from practically every county.
Kindness and courtesy are two of
the chief requisites of eVery employe
ami the state has reason to feel
proud of the manner in which It Is
making the last days of the old veter
ans as pleasant as It is possible to
niiikp them. Each home is always
crowded to its fullest capacity and
there are many applicants already
approved who are on the waiting list
for entrance. For this reason prefer
ence is 'given to the Civil war veter
ans who are in the most feeble con
dition.
It seems hard for the taxpayers to
understand why the two soldiers'
homes do not decrease in population,
considering the age of the members
and the large death rate. Up until
the last session of the legislature,
any veteran was entitled to admis
sion to the homes prepared at the
request of a committee of the state
encampment of the G. A. R. by the
present Board of Control and the
legislature was requested to change
the reading of this law so that it
would read three years' residence
rather than one year. This law was
passed.
In many of the middle Western
States there are no soldiers' homes,
•» if there are, they are unattractive.
The climatic conditions which prevail
upon the Pacific slope hare appealed
to many of the old veterans, and they
are constantly coming to this state,
establishing a residence, and then ap
plying for admission to our homes.
Under the law, the Board of Control
can do nothing but admit them after
they have completed the required
length of residence. There are at
present many applications from vet
erans of the Spanish-American war.
Most of these applicants' ages are
under forty and it has been the policy
of the board to only admit those who
are physically unable to earn a living
on the outside, owing to the fact that
there is a large waiting list of aged
and needy veterans who seek admis
sion.
Including both homes, the Western
part of the state furnishes about six
sevenths of the population, while the
Eastern part of the state furnishes
but one-seventh.
State Soldiers' Home.
This home is located one mile
from Ortlng In Pierce county and is
one of hte oldest of the state institu
tions, the law for its establishment
having been passed by an act of the
1890 legislature.
The buildings are of wood and the
timbers underneath are rotting from
age and dampness, where are Ideal
places for Incubating roaches and
vermin, which have to be fought
< onßtantly. This has long been the
case and will continue to be until
sanitary buildings have been con
structed of other material than wood.
The buildings are veritable fire-traps
and tho«e In authority tremble at
what might happen should a fire sud
denly break out. The members of
the Board of Control are very careful
at every visit to thin institution to In
spect the fire hose, hydrants and fire
extinguishers, and a short time ago
added to the amount then on hand
and caused new hydrants to be con
structed.
We have here four large buildings
for the members, named, respective
ly, the Washington building, Rogers
building, Pickering building and the
Lincoln building. In each of these
buildings are large reading rooms,
bath rooms and plenty of toilets.
Ilesldes these four large dormitories,
there Is a hospital building, which
will accommodate one hundred or
more members. While many of the
occupants of this building are not In
need of constant attention, they re
main here on account of advanced
age.
There Is a large central dining
room for the members, and the hos
pital contains a dining room of Its
own. There Is an assembly hall and
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
office building on the ground and the
commandant and engineer are allow
ed residence on the grounds.
Beside these buildings, there is
also a conservatory, barber shop,
tailor shop, carpenter shop, chicken
house, blacksmith shop, commissary
store house for the colony, power
house, laundry, nurses' cottage, and
a number of farm buildings, such as
barns, piggeries, root house, oil
house, carriage house and farm cot
tages. A new barn was recently
built at this institution with a 125
ton silo, which furnishes the princi
pal part of the winter feed for 24
fairly good dairy cows.
The value of the entire property is
placed at $106,830.00. The farm
contains 186 acres and the value of
the product raised amounts to $8,000
a year. There are outside attractions
connected with the home for many of
Its members. Many have been farm
ers during their active years and they
seem to take delight in watching the
growing crops, as well as the stock.
The present death rate Is sixteen
per cent. But few of the members
are under the age of 70 and practic
ally all of those under that age are
Spanish-American war veterans. The
population of the home, which in
cludes the colony, is about 700, but
many of these are usually out on fur
lough, making a population of about
half that number usually present.
Out of a population of 701, 639" were
veterans of the Civil war; 4 3 of tho
Spanish-American war; 17 of Indian
wars and 2 of the Mexican war.
Over one-half of the population
here give Pierce county as their
home. King county was the home of
one-sixth of the population, and Spo
kane sends but one-fifteenth. Every
county In the state is represented,
but many of the counties have a re
presentation of but one member.
Five-sixths of the population were
born In the United States; Ireland
coming next with one-eighteenth of
the members.
No women are allowed In the home
proper, but in the town of Orting,
close by, there are many small
cottages, and there has been estab
lished what is known as the Colony,
and men with their wives, or widows
who are alone, are given rations from
the state. All members of the Col
ony are allowed rations to the
amount of $7.00 per month and
clothing to the amount of $16.00 per
year. They obtain, the cottages at a
rental of from $3.00 to $5.00 per
month, which must be paid by tho
occupants.
Practically every old soldier, or
widow of a soldier, receives a pen
sion, and with this money they pur
chase luxuries or make visits to rela
tives.
Mr. Ed. C. Warner, whose home Ih
In Everett, is the present superin
tendent of the Home He is himself
a veteran of the Civil war. Mrs.
Warner, his wife, is the matron.
The state appropriated 30 cents
per day for the maintenance of each
member of the home, and the United
States Government allows $100.00
per year for each male member. The
amount which was estimated that
would be needed to run the Institu
tion until the end of this biennlum
was sixty cents per day, which In
cludes overhead charges and all. At
the present time the cost 1b running
much less than that and this Institu
tion will have a handsome surplus to
turn back to the state treasury from
the appropriation made by the last
legislature.
This Institution has an abundant
supply of spring water of an excep
tionally fine quality with a graflty
pressure of something like twenty
five pounds.
There are fifty-seven employes at
the State Soldier^ 1 Home, nearly all
of them being members who work
for a very small wage. Each dormi
tory or resident building has a Cap
tain, who Is himself an old soldier,
and who ha» complete charge of his
building.
Washington Veteran*' Home.
This Is one of the newest and most
modern Institutions of Its kind In the
I'nlted States, the 1907 legislature
creating It. It must be seen to be
appreciated. The site Is in many
ways Ideal. The buildings are on a
high bluff facing north-easterly and
overlooking Port Orchard Bay, the
city of Bremerton, and the United
States Navy Yard. The battleships,
always In sight, and general naval
activities are a constant reminder to
the veterans of the stirring scenes of
their early life. The .situation haw
one possible drawback. The wind
has a clean sweep across the grounds.
The postoftVe address of the home
was formerly Port Orchard, but as a
great deal of mall arrives and de
parts dally from the home, the post
office department at Washington, D.
C. offered to establish a postofflce at
the home, and called for a name to
be luigeited for It. On the date,the
