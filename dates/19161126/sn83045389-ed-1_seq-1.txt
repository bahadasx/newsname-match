the Yale eleven took up the battb* after!
tli? Crimson had gone Into the bad
with a Held goal in tin* opening period.
With a steady attack, aided by the
break of a Harvard fumble. Vale
forced the Haughton-coa< lied machine
ba k a rosy its own goal Mm* for tlie
only touchdown of the content.
Harvard battled viciously against
every foot gained by the Itlue, but was
tlnally heaved across its own line under
irresistible charges. Once in the lead
the home team never gave its oppo
nents an opportunity to strike again,
and held the three-point margin I
throughout one of the hardest-fought
combats of recent years in this famous
football (lassie.

'1 he victory was won before the
largest and most picturesque assem
blage of gridiron enthusiasts that has
ever witnessed a football game in this
country. Approximately, SO, 000 spec
tators were massed within the Vale
bowl, filling every available foot of
seating ami standing space, and the
scenes when the timekeeper's whistle
announced the completion of the game
surpassed anything heretofore seen in
the celebrating of success in this se
! ies.
'thousands of cheering Yale alumni
atid students rushed down tlie steep
tiers of the bowl and out upon the Held,
cngullling th fatigued Ulue heroes
as they sprinted fur the side lines.
Then out i"it th** maelstrom emerged -
the members of the winning team,
borne upon tlie shoulders of their
classmates, and the customary parade
and snake dance around the Held and
the illuminated goal posts began.
Huge balls of blue tiro were attached
to the two bars it the extreme etui
of the field, while squads of under
graduates fired volley after volley of
Roman candle balls across the bars
as the hand blared am' the Rltie sec- ?
tinti of fin* stands s ing and cheered.
Across the bowl the Harvard body
stood in silence after the Crimson
team had left the field until tin* parade
!???!:i-lied their position. Then the cheer
leaflet's called for a long yell for Vale.
A great volume of sound arose for the
HI tic eleven, and evoked an equally
hearty response from Vale, as well ns
;ipplause from the neutral spectators.

The game was played with gray I
clouds scurrying across a sun that was 1
without warmth and a gale that
reached a velocity of forty miles an
hour. It carried the kicked ball In
swirling and erratic circles, making
both punting and catching difficult and
uncertain.
Both the Harvard and Vale scores
were made when the wind gave them
the advantage.
Harvard opened the game by win
ning the toss, and Captait Dndmun
elected to defend the north goal with

much further than merely simplifving

be necessary to introduce Into the sys

arms are to be surrendered, greatlv
excited the peopie of Athens. The
Premier iiiforinally explained that the
admiral, in reply to the government's
refusal i>f his demand, brushed aside
the reasons f.ir this refusal and simply
set December J as the <iate f..r the
surrender of the artillery required. and
December 1 ,'i as the date for the sur

"Although this crisis arises every

"The railroads are already working

with the holiday shipping season
stretched over lite entire month of De
