(By Review Leased Wire) i
CHICAGO, Nov. 25. Investigation
of the high cost of living became mili
tant here today by raids on three of
the largest cold storage warehouses ,
in the city. The raids were based on i
& city ordinance, long ignored, which
places a restriction on the time food
n:ay be kept in cold storage and were
due partly, it was said, to the atti
ude of James E. Wetz, a wholesaler,
so-called "egg king." who is said to
be holding more than 72,000,000 eggs. 1
"I've got them. What are you go
ing to do about it?" was the answer
Wetz gave to investigators who sought
to discover what quantity of food
stuff was in storage in the present j
time of high prices.
The ordinance prohibits the
storage of eggs for more than 10
months. Examination showed
" tfet irany millions, including
many stored by Wetz, were put
.. away In March and April.
"Wetz will be obliged to throw
those on the market by January
1," said Dr. Robertson, health
commissioner, "and my advice to
the people is to stop using eggs
until he begins to market tbem."
Women Boycott Hen Fruit
Women of the Political Equality
League adopted ' a resolution today
declaring that "eggs at 60 cents a
dozen are prohibitive,'' and agreeing
to buy none at that price.
The high price of eggs is the result
of general prosperity, which has in
duced an extraordinary consumption
together with a shortage of produc
tion, according to a statement by the
Chicago Butter and Egg Board, which
announced that it would welcome any
investigation into its manner of ar
riving at prices.
"There is a big shortage in the
holdings of eggs and butter as estab
lished by the government reports,"
the statement said.
"The export demand has been very
heavy as may be attested by the rec
ords of the customs officials of the I
departments.
"The Increase has not been out of
proportion to the prices of wheat,
corn, shoes and clothing."

The suspension of wire communi

with cheering partisans of the
soldiers and sailors.
The gay gowns of the feminine

of vivid colors. Seas of chysanthi

both schools were waved proudly.
When the cadets troops out of the

"rushed" the colors, they had eleven
