DAIRYMEN EXCITED

AS a result of the bomb dropped
into the ranks of tho dairymen
operating dairies In unsanitary condi

ordinance prepared by Ir. DeZell
Ilawley, city superintendent of health,
the health officer was swamped with
personal and telephone calls yester
day and he has announced thut next
week he will call a meeting of all tho
dairymen of the city, at which time
the new law will be fully discussed
and the attitude of the milk producers
ninv be announced.
'There Is a violation of the city's
milk ordinances every day," said Doc
tor Ilawley yesterday, in discussing
the rcsnonso that has conio from the
passage of the ordinance. mere is
ii n ordinance in this city which pro
vides that all parcels of milk sold
shall beur the name of tho dairy from
which produced. This ordinance ap
plies to the pint, quart and hall' pint
bottles especially, but the dairymen
do not obey tho law. There is a largo
percentage of the dairies of the city
using caps for tho bottles that do not
liear tho name of the duiry. We are
going to enforco this law before we
begin tho rigid enforcement of the
new ordinance."
