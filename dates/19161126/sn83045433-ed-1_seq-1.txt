Wold Alter I. C. C.
In behalf of the railroads, Alfred P.
Thom yesterday presented to the joint
Congressional Committee the principles
the roads believed should be included in
a just system orf Federal regulation.
These included reorganization of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, its
power to. prescribe minimuth rates, rate
suspension for sixty days instead of ten
nionths, and Federal control of stock is
wtjance.
Mr. Thom suggested that the sub
regional committees he selected from men
feniliar with the locai!ties in which they
V ould sit. UP to this time it had been
thought that these sub-regional commit
tees would be composed of members of
enlarged Interstate Commerce Com
mIsslon.
Olney for Regalation.
lDuring his speech. Mr. Thom read a
lar; letter from Richard Olney, in which
the former Secretary of State earnestly
I -ommended Federal regulation as a
.necessity.'' also saying that the present
,. stem was "archaic" and "notoriously
prejudieial."
I ne argument Mr. Thom advanced for
Federal incorporation was that it would
,,ad to far more efficient transportation
in time of war.
The general counsel to the advisory
board of the railway executives con
cluded his three days' argument yester
day. Tomorrow he will take the stand
and be cross-examined by the members
of the committee. There will be no cross
examination of Mr. Thom by other wit
nesses. It is estimated that Mr. Thom.
who is merely the first witness of the
hearings, will be on the stand almost a
week.

season of real achievement, marred only
by the defea.t by, Brown. Princeton was
subdued a week ago and Harvard to
day, so why ask more?
Tale's victory was deserved. It was
clearly and cleanly won. Once a break
favored the big Blue team, but there is
quite a lot In grasping opportunities.
The entire Yale eleven played great
football, not faultless, of course, but
steady, hard and consistent. Among the
list the names of several stand out prom
inently.
Capt. Black, Legore. Gates, Comerford
'were the big four. If any seek all-star
material. we respectfully invite their at
tention to the quartet. lagore and
Black, playing their final game. shone
brilliantly. Legore's running, passing
and defense were superb. The work of
the other three mentioned kept pace fit
tingly.
One evidence of the fine physical con
dition and indomitable fighting courage
of the Yale eleven may be had from the
fact that Just one substitution was made
throughout. Church replaced Moseley.
And words of praise uttered for the
I victors do not mean to imply that the
Harvard eleven is not due high commen
dation. The Crimson battled gamely and
vallantly, losing. but only after giving
over all they had.
The record crowd assembled to watch
the great battle and did full justice to
the event. More than j7.000 seats were
I sold, to say nothing of nearly 2,000 more
who were present as attendants and at
taches.
11 1 o'clock the crowd had begun to
pour into the great bowl. Outside in
every vacant .-rot were parked automo
