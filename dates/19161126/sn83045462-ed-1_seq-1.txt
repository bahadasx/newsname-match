Representative Rodenberg of
Illinois Urges More Pay to
Meet Higher Living Cost.
BOTH CLASSES SADLY
UNDERPAID. HE ASStKI5>
Thinks Scale Mildewed With Injustice
and Inequality and Monument
of Penury and Parsimony.
An increase oi 33L;: per cent in the
salaries of all government employes
and the same increase for school teachers
in the District of Columbia is advocated
in a statement issued yesterday
by Representative Rodenberg of Illinois.
The fact that industrial corporations
are making big increases in wages of,
their employes, said Mr. Rodenberg, is
enough to cause the United States gov- 1
ernment to appropriate increases for
its clerks who are the most poorly paid
individuals in this country, according
to the Illinois representative.
Mr. Rodenberg's Statement.
The statement reads:
"The action of the United States
Steel Corporation in voluntarily in- j
creasing the wages of its vast army
of employes 33}* per cent during the
year 191?> in order to enable these employes
to meet the increased cost of
living should have the effect of causing
the present Congress to consider favorably,
and without delay, the just
and reasonable demands of government
employes for an increase in their compensation.
The most poorly paid individuals
in this country are the school
teacher and the government clerk. Mill,
factory and mine operatives, artisans
in the building trades, railroad employes?in
fact, the workmen in practically
, ory industry, have secured j
substantia I advances in wages during
the last i.w years, but the salary of
the teacher and the government clerk
remains stationary.
**There has been no readjustment of
Uncle Sam's salary scale in fifty years. <
That scale is mildewed with injustice
and inequality, and is a monument to
penury and parsimony. No government
employe is ever overpaid and 90 per cent
of them are always underpaid.
"In pa?t everv to ince^"?
the compensation of government employes
in any legislative appropriation bi 1 .as 1
invariably been prevented by some cheese-1 1
paring demagogue, posing as the guardian I
of the Treasury, making a point of order I
against the proposed increase. It Is time,
therefore, that Congress should deal with
this imnortant nnactinn in o aAoinus n.<>1 I ,
systematic manner, animated only by ai
desire to do even-handed justice to all j
government employes. j
Says XT. S. Can Afford It. j
"So far as I am personally concerned j
I have no hesitancy in saying: that I be- ;
lleve that the rich *r?d powerful govern- j
raent of the United States can afford to j
be as just and generous as the United!
States Steel Corpotation. I would not'
hesitate to vote for a bill granting a gen- '
eral increase of 33 1-3 per cent in the i
salaries paid to all government employes, i
and I would apply the same rate of in- ;
crease to the salaries of the school teach- t
ers of the District. i
"Statistics show that the cost of liv- j
ing has increased 53 per cent during !
the last two years and there is no indi- !
cation of relief in sight. On the con- I
trary. everything points to still further !
advances in the cost of the necessaries j
of life. If Congress is disposed to be j
fair to the faithful employes of the j
government these changed conditions !
should be taken into consideration and j
a law granting substantial relief should j
be speedily enacted. !
"Aside from the admitted equities of j
the movement for an increase of compensation
of government employes. I
believe such increase can be fully justilled
from the standpoint of practical
economics. 1 maintain that an employe
is incapable of performing the
best and most efficient service if constantly
harassed by thoughts of his inability
to meet the ordinary living ex
penses of hiro3fc!f and family. I have '
always believed that "the laborer is
worthy of his hire,' and I shall welcome
an opportunity to give my unqualified
support to any measure providing for 1
fair and equitable treatment of the employes
of the federal government.
FAR EXCEEDS ITS GOAL.
Railway Y. M. C. A. Adds 38,124
Members to Its Roll.
NEW YORK. November 25?Far exceeding
its goal, the railroad department
of the Young Men's Christian
Association han completed its ten-day
continental campaign for 20,000 new
members, with a record of 2fe,124, ac- j
oording to nearly complete returns an- ;
nour.ced at the organization's head- j
quarters here today. Yesterday, the
last day of the campaign, more than
8,O0fl new names were enrolled.
The campaign was directed by 250 j
Railroad Young Meen's Christian As- j
relations over all the country?from j
Anchorage, Alaska, to St. Augustine,
Kb . and from San Antonio. Tex., to j
Portland. Me A membership commit- ,
tee of 10,0'jO railroad men. representing .
every phab< railroad life, carried on
the work. The record for a single as- j
sedation was established at Trenton, |
N. J. where 1.521 new men were en- {
rolled The record for any one rail- ;
road went to the Pennsylvania, with a
total of *.>>74.
The acquisition of these new men
gives the organization a membership
of more than 99,00*. making It the
largest railroad organization of any
kind in trie world.
DIET SQUAD LOSES WEIGHT. !
Said to Be Dae to a Dance in Which !
They Participated.
CHICAGO, November 25.?The health j
department's diet squad of six men and i
six women, who are living on 40 cents!
a day in an attempt to show how the i
high cost of living can be ignored with- \
out impairing their health, was shy an I
aggregate of seventeen and a half;
pounds in weight today, due to a dance j
given by the department last night. j
Dr. John Dill Robertson, health com
inissioiier. said they danced the weight j
off. Only two of the squad, both worn- i
en. gained since yesterday. Kacb took j
on half a pound.
Since the test started last Wednesday
seven members have gained ten and a'
half pounds, and five have lost a t >tal i
of twelve pounds. The dance complete-!

Note: Each date falls on Tues- !
day.
The formal program of social entertainments
to be given by President and
Mrs. Wilson during the season of 1916
and 1917 was announced at the White
House last night, the principal feature
being the omission of the reception in
honor of the members of the diplomatic
corps, the place of which was taken
last year by a reception in honor of the
Latin-American diplomats. There, is no
nari-Amprifati rpppntinn thi>;
year, and no New Year reception is
announced.
With the omission of the diplomatic
reception, usually the most brilliant
entertainment, public or private, of the
winter in Washington and which has
been a time-honored event, it is evident
that the social program at the White
House this winter is to be an extremely
simple one. The entertainments begin
three weeks earlier than last season,
and end that much earlier, probably
for the reason that it might be inconvenient
to be carrying out a social program
around inauguration time.
The first event on the schedule is a
dinner, December 12, In honor of the
members of the cabinet. This is to be
followed, December 19, by a reception
in honor of the Judiciary; January 9, by
a diplomatic dinner; January 16, by
another diplomatic dinner; January 23.
by a reception in honor of the members
of Congress; January 30, by a dinner in
honor of the Supreme Court of the
United States; February 6, by a recep- 1
tion in honor of th Army and Navy. I
and February 13, by a dinner in honor ;
of the Speaker of the House of Repre- {
sentatlves.
'.
To finish Before Inauguration, j
On this schedule the state entertain- ;
nents will be ended moi? than two weeks
>efore the inauguration. Another interesting
change is In connection with the
'act that last season the state recep:ions
were given Friday evenings and the
jtate dinners were given Tuesday evenngs.
Before the administration of Presi- |
lent Wilson all state entertainments were
jivun Thursday evenings. This season,
however, all the entertainments will be
riven Tuesday evenings.
There are to be two "diplomatic dinners"
this season, as last, owing to the
var in Europe, and the fact that it is ;
lot expedient to invite to the White j
House at the same time the representa- j
lives of the powers which are at war !
artth each other. The expedient of hav- j
ng two dinners solved this problem last i
season, the representatives of the allies
t?eing invited to one and the representalivs
of the Teuton powers and their
ompanions in arms being invited to the
>ther. It is presumed that this plan will
t>e followed again this season, Ambassador
Jusserand, representing France, j
oeing the ranking diplomat who will i
escort Mrs. Wilson to dinner at the enter- i
tainment to which representatives of the !
lilies are invited, and Ambassador von j
Bernstorff, representing Germany, being j
:he ranking diplomat who will escort Mrs.
Wilson to dinner at the entertainment to J
which representatives of the Teuton pow- j
;rs and their companions in arms are in- i
/ited.
The public of Washington, including;
merely the "onlookers." have always,
taken a deep interest in the gaia social;
events at the White House, and the j
rtipiomatic reception has always been j
the means of bringing to Washington j
for the winter social season a large and i
important group of hostesses from j
other cities, especially New York, j
Philadelphia. Boston. Baltimore, Rich- S
mond and other eastern communities, ;
who have taken houses hee. and who ,
have entertained largely because of t
the brilliancy of the social winter as!
set by the White House program. This!
has usually made the month of January
an especially interesting one so- I
dally, but the coming January there |
will be but one reception at the White;
House?the one in honor of the members
of Congress.
The Less Important Functions.
i
The other events on the White House
program for January are dinners,
which do not attract as much public attention
as the receptions. The nights
the latter are held it has been no unusual
thing to see thousands of Washingtonians
gathered In the neighbor- j
hood of the White House, Irrespective
of the weather, which has often been of j
a semi-blizzard character, to watch the1
gay throngs arriving in carriages, in
automobiles and afoot, as happy and
as eager at the prospect of the revels
within the brilliantly illuminated and
historic old mansion as the actual
participants about to enter.
Another innovation in this season's procrrarii
is that the receotions an- tn l^cHn
at 9 o'clock instead of 'J:30 o'clock, the
hour of la?t season. This. will probably
have the effect of having them end earlier
and giving the tired President and "the
lirst lady of the land" an opportunity to
retire earlier, after having stood in line
for hours and laboriously shaken so many
hands, as they are required to do.
The fact that there is to be no resumption
of the New Year reception, long a
feature of White House life dear to the
heart of the Washingtonian before the
administration of President Wilson, because
thousands of Washingtonians in all
walks of life paid their respects to the
leading citizen of Washington on that
day. caused no surprise in Washington
last night. President Wilson never having
held such a New Year reception, and being.
it is understood, opposed to it.

By iiio Asso'-iaie?l Press.
NEW YORK, November 25.?Army
skill triumphed over Navy pluck when
the foot ball teams from" West Point
and Annapolis clashed in their annual
battle at the Polo grounds today; The
Cadets' victorious score was 15 to 7,
but the Middies fought gamely and
grimly until the final blast of the
whistle.
Some 50,000 citizens, not counting the
governor of New York, cabinet officers,
generals, admirals, and an array of!
lesser lights in both branches of tho
government service, saw the combat.
Only for the absence of President Wilson,
the. game would have provided all
the. spectacular incidents which go to
make Army-Navy foot ball battles historic.
Chill winter winds swept through the
great stands packed with cheering partisans
of the soldiers and sailors. The
gay gowns of the feminine rooters
were hidden under furs and heavy
coats. But there was no lack of vivid
color. Seas of chrysanthemums swayed
as their wearers cheered and shouted,
and the pennants of both schools were
waved proudly.
Victors in Serpentine Dance.
When the Cadets trooped out of the
stands at the end of the game and
"rushed" the colors, they had eleven
victories to their credit to the Navy's
nine, and they celebrated this achievement
in time-honored fashion. Seven
hundred a^d sixty strong, they passed
In front of their beaten rivals, did a serpentine
dance about the field before,
forming a great oval, and then, at a
given signal, rushed pell mell about
their colors, held aloft by three of their
number.
The soldiers did most of their cheer- i
ing early in the game, for the Army J
started off with a rush. On the kick-off
Oliphant caught the ball on his own
five-yard line, and carried It back
through a broken field, past eleven
plunging middies to within five yards
of the Navy's goal. From that point
it was rushed over for a touchdown. It ,
also was Oliphant who later kicked a 1
field goal for the Army.
Hero of Annapolis Clans.
Goodstein, the young center for the i a
Navy, was the hero of the Annapolis j t
clans tonight. He broke through the i c
Army line in the third period, blocked j \
one of Vidal's punts, and raced fifteen i i
yards for a touchdown. j /
Gov. Whitman, Mayor Mitch el. Sec- j t
retary of the Navy Daniels and Secre- i i
tary of War Baker were among the ]
official dignitaries who occupied boxes ;
when the battalion of cadets marched j e
onto the field In light blue uniforms, r
with long overcoats and carrying yel- ^
low pennants, with a band at their
head, the soldiers paraded in company 1
front, dragging a mounted gun as a | t
mascot.
They started a storm of applause i t
that was renewed several times as they j t
gave a display of the machine-like j fc
marching for which they are famous, r
Then their band played them up into c
their bleachers at double time.
Goat Is Naval Mascot. c
A few moments after tho cadets had
cleared the field tho middies, about
1,200 strong, marched in with their
blue and crimson uniformed bandsmen fc
In the long navy blue coat of their t
service they were in deep contrast to v
the arrny. Their perfect marching, t
first in columns of four, then swinging c
into a front that extended the length f
of the field, produced another burst of I
applause from the spectators, which *
continued until tiie sailors reached c
their seats. They brought a goat as ?
their mascot. i
Just before the Army team appeared j a
upon the field the cadets, standing with | j
heads uncovered, gave the West F'olnt j r
cheer, at the end of which their two- j j
inch cannon roared a salute to the ; $
soldier players. : c
When the Navy team came into sight s
a few seconds later, their goat mas- . t
cot greeted them with antics that were t
accepted by the middy rooters as be-| c
tokening good luck. r

Secretaries Greet Each Other.
! <
Between the second and third periods }
Secretary Daniels and Secretary Baker, , c
surrounded by officers high in their re- ' |
spective services, walked to the cen- I y
ter of the field and greeted each other, j
In the Hudson river a fleet of six
battleships and lesser fighting craft !
had dropped anchor to give their men y
and officers a chance to see the game, j
and it was said that about 10,000 were !
granted shore leave for this purpose. '
li was all Army in the first half of the
game. Oliphant's running back of tho 1
kick-off almost the entire length of the 1
field made it look to the spectators as s
if it would be a runaway race. Oliphanf
and Vidal were the Army's stars, keeping
the ball in their opponents' territory *
all through the first two periods. A well- ]
executed forward pass, Gerhart vm0i 1
brought the second Army touchdown 1
early in the second period. Ollphant
tailed to kick a goal for either touch- {
down. *
Team Shows New Vigor. 1
'With the score 15 to 0 aealnst them. J
the Middies returned to the field after <
the intermission between the halves to '
make a desperatb^effort to win. Rob- I {
erts. who caught tnb kick-off on his own . t
5-yard line, ran back 25 yards '
before he was tackled. The whole Navy '
team appeared to have found new vigor.
Plays off tackle and well-executed for- '
ward passes brought the ball to the
Army's 25-yard line on an exchange of
punts. Goodstein then broke through,
blocked a kick and made a touchdown,
Keifel kicking the goal.
The Army's goal line was again imperiled.
only to be saved by a i 0-yard
run by Ollphant. The Army star was
watched more closely, however, by his
opponents in the last two periods and
made no other spectacular runs. Von
Helmberg. who substituted for Fisher
in the final period, did the punting for
the Navy while be was in the game and
outdistanced his Army rivals.

AUTO IS HIT BY TRAIN:
TWO KILLED INSTANTLY
Mrs. J. A. Johnson and Daughter
Dead; Her Father and Son
Mortally Hurt.
Special Dispatch to The Star.
SALISBURY, Md, November 25.?
Struck by a Hying- express train while
crossing a track in an automobile this
afternoon, a woman and her daughter
were killed instantly and her father
and son so badly injured that both are
expected to'die.
The dead are: Mrs. J. A. Johnson of
near Accomac, Ya., and her little
aughter Rose.
The father, George S. Crockett, who
was driving, and his little grandson,
John, who are at the Salisbury Hos- J
pitau. are not expected to live through
the night. The tragedy, which threatens
to wipe out the entire family, occurred
at a crossing of the New York,
Philadelphia and Nortoik railroad, just (
south of the Maryland lino.
Failing to -see or hear the approaching
train, Mr. Crockett drove right
across the tracks in the path of flying
death.
As the train hit the automobile all
of the occupants were hurled from the
machine, landing many feet away. The
mother and child had been sitting in
the tonneau, which seems to have rereived
the full force of the crash. Mr.
Crockett and his grandson, ho e er. i
ivere thrown farther than the others.
Phe man's skull was crushed and the
lad was internally injured and suffer- i
?d many broken bones.
After hitting the machine, the train i
eturned to the scene and the injured ?
vere rushed to the hospital here. Pieces .
>f the automobile were strewn along '
he tracks for several hundred yards. ^
Mr. Crockett was known to be very r

Attitude on Militarism.
The report of a special committee appointed
to prepare a statement of the
principles upon which the federation
declares it3 position with respect to
"militarism" was adopted unanimously.
"The American trades union move-!
ment is convinced by the experience of!
mankind," says the report, "that mili- i
tarism even in its less horrid mani- j
festationa brutalizes those influenced!
by the spirit of the institution.
"We are unalterably opposed to any
form of physical training or any quality
of mental education which would
tend to inculcate the spirit of militarism.
*The child's immature and impressionable
mind must not be taught
to think except with horror upon the
killing of human beings. To arouse
the thought that any of their school
hours are devoted to preparation for
the possible use of arms against their
fellowmen is to brutalize their in- ,
stincts and subvert the influence of i
the necessary lessons of humanity, !
peace and good will, which it is the i
duty of our public schools to impress i
upon them."

Islands Are Occupied.
A late phase of the advance of the
Teutonic allies, the pressure upon Rumania
by crossing the Danube river,
is dealt with in announcements by the
German, Rumanian and Russian war
offices. The forces of Field Marshal von
Mackensen have crossed the Danube
from the south and have gained a footing
or. Rumanian soil, making further
advances. Bulgarian troops have occupied
islands in the Danube near the
mouth of the Alt river near Orsova and
at two other points.
From Bucharest, however, comes the
announcement that the advancement of
the German troops across the Danube,
at Islacz and at Zimmtza, has been arrested
north of those places. Rumanian
troops operating on the extreme
left of their line In Wallachla
have extricated themselves, after destroying
a huge quantity of cereal^
according to a rtirograa report.
Admit Retirement on Alt.
It is admitted by the Rumanians
that their troops have retired on the
left bank of the Alt river, after repulsing
several attacks along the whoks
front of that sector. It is asserted at
Berlin that the resistance of the Rumanians
in the lowlands of the lower
Alt has been broken and that several
towns in Rumania, south of the Alt
pass, have been captured by the invaders.
Rumanian battalions, cut off from
the main army in the wooded mountains
northeast of Turnu-Severin, were
at latest accounts still offering tenacious
resistance.

BERLIN, November 25, by wireless to
Sayville.?Gen. von Falkenhayn, commander-in-chief
of the victorious
armies in the Transylvanian invasion,
has congratulated the soldiers of the
ninth army on their exploits, says an
Overseas News Agency statement today,
which quotes the general as follows:
t
"For weeks you were forced to fight
on ice-bound, rocky heights and in
deep, snow-covered valleys, usually
without shelter from gunfire and often
cut off for many days from all communications.
But not one of you
failed. Wherever the enemy was to
be held he was bound with an Iron
grip; where he had to be crushed he
was pulverized; where he had to be
beaten he was struck to the heart."
