The dispatches Indicated that the
defenders of tho city were preparing
for a resumption of the attack by
Vllllatos today.
Although the northern part of the
f ity whore Villa Is expected to launch
his next blow, Is unfortified tho ad
vises received here stated thut Tre
vino's guns mounted on Santa Ilosa
hill could protect that section .
Officers at Southern Department
headquarters said that notwithstand
ing the proximity of Villa forces near
the punitive expedition all tho Amerl
ran soldiers and aoneral Pershing's
lines or communication were safe.
It Is not believed that Villa, with
all his daring, will be reckless enough
to allow himself or hs men to got too
near Pershing's forces.

EL PASO. .scv. 20 That Chihuahua
City Is In th. hands of Villa bandits
and an. Jacinto Trevlna has evac
uated and Is on the way to Juarez,
waa a report received by wire In
Juarez from Haux.
The message slated Villa seised the
city yesterday afternoon, and as the
pandits entered, General Trevlno and
his men started for tho border.

Previous to this Interruption of
communication General Treylno re
ported to Oen. Francisco Gonsktes In
Jusrer that Villa had made three at
tacks since 4 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, and that the bandit leader had
been repulsed each time.
At 3 o'clock thla morning a report
waa current In Juares that General
Trevlno had been killed, but officials
denied that any such message had
been received.
Many Ofgrera Fall.
Trevlno reported tho third day's
fighting came as a surprise, but was
morn 'Intense than on either of the two
preceding days.
lie stated that three attacks were
made, and In each Instance the Car
ranxa soldiers repulsed the enemy
with heavy losses.
He admits, however, that the dead
and wounded of the Carranxa officers
Include M. Gandara, killed; Colonel
Ilorques. wounded; Lieut. Col, IT. Mler,
killed: Second rapt. Rodolfn Cabello
and Lieut. Klpldlo Oarxa, killed. The
last named two officers belonged to
General Trevlno'a staff.
Attack Charged.
The fact that wire communication
has been cut off and no word appar
ently has been received at Saus, other
than that cannonading could be heard
there. Indicated the bandits have,
either entirely surrounded the city
or have changed their point of at
tack from the vicinity of Cerro Co
lonla, near the Mexico national lines,
to the northwestern part of the city.
It Is reliably reported that Villa
has some artillery nieces he Is using
In his attack and that some of the
losses amon" tho Carranza officers Is
attributed to tho shrapnel dropped
Into tho city. The cannon are sup
posed to have been taken from Gen
eral Mavcotte after his defeat at
.Santa Hosalla.
A wholesale plot said to Involve
officials and employes of tho Mexico
Central railroad wua discovered yes
terday when, about a dozen employes
of the railroad were arrested on a
charge of aiding the bandits In the
rapture of a carload of ammunition
sent to Oeneral Trevlno when tho
fighting started.
Animaaltlon Gone.
The car of cartridges and other
munitions v was sent from Juares
Thursday and apparently the train
was not molested by bandits, but
when the car was opened In Chihua
hua there waa no ammunition Inside.
On the following day a train carry
ing a load of coal and other supplies
waa started for Chihuahua. When It
reached Montezuma It was discovered
that the coal was only about a foot
deep and below the coal were numer
ous cases of ammunition Intended
for the bandits. The engine and ca
boose were sent back to Juares. where
the facts were placed before General
Gonzales. Meanwhile every employe
Of the railroad In Juarez, Ith one
exception, has been arrested and be
ing held for investigation.
Heady to Attack Juares.
The Queveio and Marcus Corral,
brother or Mrs. Lus Corral Villa, are
at Gallego, and have 1,100 men at
their commani. ready to lead an at
tack on Juarez soon. This report was
mde by rallrod man who reached CI
Paso today and who says he talked
with the bandit leaders at Gallego
Friday morning. He lays the attack
on Juares will not be made until after
the result of the Chihuahua fight Is
known. More than 250 armed soldiers
wore seen In the vlchilty of Guada
loupe, about twenty miles down tho
river yesterday.
General Murgla Is stl.l In the dls
diet south of Jlmlnez liatead of be
ing about to attack the rear of the
Villa bandits at Chlhuahva. This re
port was received In Juirez before
tho wire failed yesterda) morning.
It also was reported the landlta de
feated Murgla and forced him to re
treat to the south. As the vlro com.
munlcatlon to the south has been cut
off It Is likely General Burglu has not
learned of the danger In wilch the

placed.

speculators and ptlce boosters.
That the market will take a de

and that the speculators ,wlll stand to

local commission men.
Speculators, figuring that they
could create a shortage In the market

Throughout the potato counties
which supply Philadelphia they have
a similar volume stored In ware

at prices In excess of $1.00 a bushel,
To realize tholr big profits, specu
lators would have to get better than
2 a bushel.
Commission men announced that
owing to the cold weather and the
fact that housewives were curtailing
the uso of potatoes and buying In
small quantities, wholesale prices
would take a tumble, and that po
tatoes may sell at f 1.39 a bushel.

moved out there, happy at last In tho
realization that tho dream of the

Today they do not know whether
they can keep their little route.
Where, two or throe years ago, K was
possible to ninkn a few small pay

U-BOATS IN LANES,
WARNING TO SHIPS
Official
at British Consulate
Admits Report, But Is Pur
2lod at Leak.
Tlin master of every vessel of the
allied powers that left Atlantic iiorts
today and yesterday was warned of
the probable proximity of Uerman
aubmsrlnes to the transatlantic lanes.
Advices sent to Ottawa from Kng
land and relayed to the British and
French ateanuhlp offices stated that
two U-boat had left Brnmerhavrn
on Novemlief 7 and ver due off
fik'amuket -about November Si.
Tlie report was confirmed by an of
ficial or the Ilrltlsh consulate gen
eral In New York, who said he did
not know how the news was made
public, but admitted that It was
true.
IMIoala After Traaspsrls.
A representative of one of the Kng
llsh lines said that while the wrst
bound U-boats probably would de
stroy any allied craft that came
within reach, they had been sent here
primarily to destroy the Olympic and
the Mauretanla. which aro transport
ing t'anadlan troops between Halifax
and Liverpool.
None of the port captains of the
trench, Ilrltlsh or Italian lines would
say that he had been Instructed to de
cart fimn his rnrular rniira.. 1. la
understood that the masters have been
nuviseu to use meir own judgment as
to course.
.May Take "outbern Course.
Acting on tho belief that ono or
both of the undersea raiders may
"loaf" along the eastbound lane be
tween Kable Island and Piim Itaeo In
the hope of "sinking Canadian troop
snips, vessels are expected to awing
well to the south, probably COO miles
below their customary route.
Wireless wurnlng In code have beer
sent from Halifax and Bermuda, and
upon these communications alone will
the -westbound vessels depend for In
structions. No vessel under the Brltlfli or
French flag la permitted to use Ita
wireless except for listening, aa tho
British admiralty considers wireless
transmission from ship to ship to be
of assistance to undersea raiders.
Guarding Atlantic Lanes.
It la generally believed that tljo
Ilrltlsh admiral In charge of the naval
station at Halifax has made provision
for guarding the east and westbound
lanes.
According to the marine observers,
the French liner Im Touralne and tlm
Italian liner Verona, which left port
yesterday, maintained their custom
ary. course eastward,
Tho Cunarded Pannanls, which was
due hero on Thursday, waa not re
ported yesterday, and It Is assumed
that a timely warning from Halifax
or Bermuda has forced her far to the
south to avoid the U-boats,

was due today, probably lias taken

U-BOAT ISSUE
Graves Asserts Letters to Bern
storff Told of Resumption of
Ruthless Warfare.
PREDICTS BREAK IS NEAR
Diplomatic Relations Expected
to Be Severed in Six Months,
He Declares.
By JUDSON C. WELLIVER.
Count von Bernstorff, German am
bassador to tho United Statos, has
been warned by his government that
a niw crisis between the two coun
tries Is near.
He haa been notified that unre
stricted submarine warfare Is now
the German policy: that It probably
will lead to war, and that within six
months the two countries will In all
Piobablllty have discontinued diplo
matic relations. ,
This Is the story, Just come ta-ilght,
of Karl rmgaard Graves, who calls
himself ih master spy, and who
claimed he had been In the (l.rman
secret service mnny esrs.
Arretted Here.
Oavea, recently waa arrested on
charge of trying to rMl to an attache,
of the German embassy In this city
three letters purporting to bo per
sonal communications from n German
woman ot high plsce to Couniesa von
Bernstorff. These three letters werv
turned over to the Secret Ken-Ice of iht
United States, and arc now In their pos
elon. Graves claimed that the letter
wero not stolen but that they came
to him direct from Berlin though the)
were written for other eyes. .
Ho alleged that they were In a ci
pher and that In the guise of unlm-
ortont puraoual communications they
ronriated a message of the grestvst'
International significance. The sub
stance of this message ns Graves hsi.
slated since his arrest was this:
Text of Message.
To Ambassador Count von
Bernstorff: Do prepared to leaxe
America at any time. Admiral
von Tlrplts has returned, from jils
exile at the frontier and is In
control once more. Unrestricted
submarine warfare will be re
sumed and will probably lead to
war between the United States
and Germany.
This message Graves claimed could
be made out of the letters.
Ho claimed that having In his pos.
session the code he could translate
the message to the satisfaction and
conviction of anybody who under
stood German. ' t
Graves Is now hejd under bond for
appearance before a Federal commls
ent In New York.
In New York.
Hald He Wasn't Worried.
He repeatedly declared, after his
arrest, thst he was not worried about
his predicament, and with the utmost
sangfroid Insisted that ho govern
ment would employ extreme measures
against him, bicause he knew too
much.
Whether the Secret Service people ,
have, undertaken to confirm Graves'
claim that a mrsssge of the greatest
significance waa carried In the seem-
ingIyaiinlmportant personal letters to
Countess von Bernstorff Is not known.
Thi Secret Service people have been
chary of all expression concerning
the case.
It Is known, however, that In the
days since the arrest of Graves a
strong impression, mysterious In IU
origin, has gained ground In this
country and also In Germany, that
the relations of the two nations aro
approaching a new crisis. .
Denial bv Stale Denilrtment.
The State Department has Insisted
that tl known no reasons why such u
feeling should prevail, But there I
no doubt that both In this c.iuntry and
In Infonped circles In Germany, thy
view Is now entertulncd that a serloui
situation Impends.
The report that four mn subms
hTe report that four more subms
try, and that presumably warfare on
shipping Is to be resumed off the
New Fngland coast. ls regarded as of
the largest significance by people
who know of Graves' declarations,
and of his prediction that a new
crisis would very soon develop be
tween the two countries.
