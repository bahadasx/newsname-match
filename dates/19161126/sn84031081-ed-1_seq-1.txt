president Wilson and Secretary
Lansing began 'he study of the pro
tocol todny and It was said by other
officials thai the agreement followed
the eenenil ideas of the administra
te!. Carranta's Action Uncertain.
The attitude of General Curranza
toward the agreement is considered
here as more problematical.
Albert .1 Panl, one of the Mexican
jnomhers of the joint commission, will
deliver it to him at Queretaro and
ill make I lUpplemenUwy explana
tion of the attitude of the American
commissioners.
Formal action hy the administration
fill not be hurried because of the time
required for Panl to reach Queretaro.
Officials display a determination to
deal firmly with the Mexican ques
tion, no matter what attitude General
Carranna takea toward the agreement.
Will Watch Junius.
One development of the conference
pptrded here as signifh ant of better
riaiaam between the two outlines
was a promise by the American com
missioners that those suspected of
plotting against the Carrania de facto
Kovcrnment in this country will ho
closely watched hy the United States
jtovernment and rigidly punished if it
is found they are attempting to violaty
neutrality. i
Thig pledge, which was not put in
writing, was given after the Mexican
commissioners had complained that
much of the difficulty along the bor
der had been due to plots formed
within the United States.
The American members made it
dear that claims of non-enforcement
of neutrality laws would not be nc
eerted as excusing violations of Amer
ican rights at the border.
