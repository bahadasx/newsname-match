been closed to them at Roseburg,
where they boarded the freight, and
they were obliged to dispose them
selves as best they could about the
closed box cars and flats loaded with
lumber and other merchandise. Their
coming had been heralded when they
left Roseburg, and a reception com

40 ours FOR u. s,
TO LEAVE MEXICO
Washington. Nov. 25 Only Gen
eral Carrsasa and General Villa stood
today aa possible obstacles to frul
tloa of the Atlantic City conference
agreement tor withdrawal of Gen
eral Pershing's forces from Mexico
la the next 49 days.
The American government itself
Is prepared to ratify the protocol, In
asmuch aa It was shaped npoa terms
President Wilson himself approved.
What Carraasa will do Is a prob
lem, though the administration be
lieve ha wIU sign It, even though
It may be-distasteful (because of In
clasioa of provisions that tha Halted
States troops msy follow bsndits Into
Mexico at any time.
The other obstacle Villa may
be eliminated by the Chihuahua Clty-j
battle, military men say. But they
do not overlook the disastroua sit
uation that would follow a Villa vic
tory at this point Villa Is an ele
ment In the situation from the fact
that the withdrawal is conditional on
conditions remaining satisfactory
during the next 40 days.
A Villa victory would now upset
sll withdrawal plans and create In
tolerable northern Mexican condi
tions, experts say. Carranxa will
probably acquiesce. It Is thought here,
In the light of what his representa
tives have been told. During the
past week, the American members of
the commission have teen bluntly
frank ia informing the Mexican group
ot what consequences they may ex
pect If they do not meet American
terms.
Chairman Laae, back la town, was
slated to present the protocol early,
