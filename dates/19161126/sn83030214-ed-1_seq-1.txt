El Paso, Tex., Nov. 'J5. After three
days of assault. during which lie at?
tacked the city from the ncuth, west
and east, BahTariag repalaoa each t.me,
Francisco Villa this afternoon moved
the main body of his bandit force to
the north, and, returning to the as?
sault, drove his men into Chihuahua
City.
That is the report brought to Ll
Paso lat? to-night.
It adda that Yillistas and ( arran/.is
tas are battling in the streets of Chi?
huahua in almost hand-to-hand conflict"
for the possession of the city, which
Villa has sworn he arill take if it costs
him his last man. Villa entered the
city Thursday night. but was unable
to hold his ground.
Following an oneaeceeafal attaek
from the east this morning. Villa sent
part of his force to the north to rut
the railroad and telegraph lines to
Juarez. Then he ordered a general
assault from the \*rtl plain on ,tli<*
north, toward which the Carranza can?
non on the heights west and south of
the city could not be trained. With the
artillery of hi* enemies rendered inef
fective, Villah ad little difficulty in
carrying the assault into the city'a
suburbs.
Fall of (ity Keported
To-night Juarez heard that t'hihua
l.uu had fallen nnd that Villistas had
cornmenced a massaere of the ct.izens,
directing then campaign of marder es?
pecially against Chiaaaa, of ahaaa there
are trt hundred in the city. Carranza
officials in Juarez denied the report,
and said the wire interruption between
Juarez and Chihuahua had been located
at a point half wi.y betwen the two
cities.
It was while Carranzistas in Juare?
eelebratiag the reported repulse
of Villa in the third morning's battle
thnt a message came telling of a re
nawal of the attaek in greater force
than any yet made by Villa. Tben the
wires failed.

General Gonaalea, Juarez caaa?dant,

That's all that can be said of the rate
of travel. It is f=carcely a toss-un be?

that. From Colonel Fisk to the rear

There is only one drawback to the

Halifax and Bermuda
Flash Wireless to
Allied Liners
The msster of erery vessel of the.
Allied powers that left this port a**.
terdsy was werned of tlie probable
proximity of (ierman submarines to
the transatlantic lanes. Advices sent
to Ottawa from Kngland and relayed
to the British and Freneh fteamship
ottlces in this city atsted that two U
boats had left Bremerhaven on Novem?
ber 7 snd were due off Nnntucket about
November 24.
A representstlve of one of the Eng?
lish lines ?aid yesterday that while
the westbound L'-boat* probably would
deatroy any Allied craft that came
within reach, they had been sent here
primarily to destroy the Olympic and
the Mauretania, whieh are transporting
Canadian troops between Halifax and
Liverpool.
None of the port captains of the
I'renc'n. Hritish or Italian lines would
-,ay that he had been instructed to de
part frorn hi* regular course. It is
tinderstood thnt the masters have been
ad\ ised to use their own judgment aa
to course.
Ships May Take Southern Course
Acting on the belief that one or both
of the undersea raiders may "loaf
alongthe eastbound lane between Sable
Irland and Cape Race in the hope of,
sinking Canadian troop ships, veAsels
which left port yesterday are expected
to iwing well to the south, probsbly I
five hundred miles below their cui-,
tomsry route.
Wireless warnings in codf have been
sent from Ilalifax and Bermuda, and
BBOB the.e communications alone will r
the westbound vessels depend for in- l
structione. No vesiel under the Brit?
ish or Freneh flag is permitted to use
its wireless except for listening. ss the
British Admiralty considers wireless
traasaaiaaiM /rom ship to ship to be of
aeaiataaaa to undersea raiders.
A representative of the British Con- j
r-ulate in this city said yesterday that '
the ft'arnlngs had been sent to all
??eamships of the Entente Powers in
and about these waters, but thst the |
sourco of the information could not be
disclosed.
It la generally believed that the Brit?
ish admiral in charge of the naval sta?
tion st Halifax has made provision for
guarding the east and westbound lsnes.
Liners Hold Regular Course
According to the msrine observers,
the Freneh liner La Toursinc snd the
lUtlian liner Verona, which left port
yesterda-,, maintained their customary
course eastward.
Tbe (unarder Pannonia, which was
rlue here on Thursday, was not re?
ported yesterday, and it is asduined
that a timely warning from Halifax or
Bermuda has forced her far to the
south to avoid the U*hoatS.
The Anchor liner Tuscania, which
?aa due to-day, probably has taken
?! ?? .ama course, as it wai said st the
company's pier yesterday that she
would not make port before Tuesday.
The Kroonland and Philadelphia, in
bound under the American flag, re?
ported heavy weather. The wireless
messeges from them indicatc both sre
on their regular course.
Stesmship men here believe thst the
U*H is still on this side of the At?
lantic and probably ls seeking supplies
and fuel a few hundred miles southeast
ef Ba*badoes. Supporting this belief
i? the fact that na British passenger
carriers are r.ow stoppmg at Barbadoes
on their trips to South America.

luxury. War and poveity exist outsiiie. bat here all is comfort. I am
loath to ri.e. Kven breakfast i? reassuring. -There i* coffee saccharine.
and a tiny drop of milk, two roll., r.o butter. but some delicious jam. It
is last year's jam. This year's jam has little sugar.
As I start to leave the hotel I pause in tho entrance to gaze up and
dowa the famous street, Unter den Linden. Thin streams of people are
passing and repassing. It i? Monday, but the atmosphere ia that of Sun?
day. German week-days now are all like Sunday. A little group of
people is pfBSflod agaiast a big glass window. Here the latest war bu!
letins are posted. Peop!.. always assemble at two epots-war hulletin*.
and food shops. It is uncanny to dee tragic eyes gazing into pastry shops
and fruit stores. Meat is not di. played. I wnndered why the butter and
eb00M stores wrrt igr.ored. I tried gazing in one. They put up such B
f?ood appearanee with their shining tinfoil packages. Then I discovered
the reason. Tlie packages are fake. Kach holds a block of wood. There
i? no butter or theese in window or shop. Twice a week a tiny supply
arrives to be distribut-,1 to the bearers of cards. and that is all.
