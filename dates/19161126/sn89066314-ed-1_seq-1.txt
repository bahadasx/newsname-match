CRIES MRS. LESLIE'S
Defense Offers Explanations
of Screams Heard Night
of Murder.
By United Tress
ST. JOSEPH, Nov. 25. A type writ
ten letter addressed to D. C. McDan
iel, aged father of Oscar McDaniel, on
trial charged with the murder of his
wife, was the sensational development
of the case today. It came from St
Louis and the writer purports to be
one of the slayers of Mrs. McDaniel.
He said three men are implicated in
the murder. The letter was not
signed and was mailed on November
-
An attempt is being made to dis
credit the testimony that Mrs. McDan-
iel contemplated divorce as testified to
by at least one witness was the first
move of the defense. The state at
tempted to prove that the divorce was
the motive for murder. ;
Screams heard in the vicinity of the
McDaniel home, that state witnesses
say they heard, were accounted for by
the first witness called by the defense
after noon. In the testimony of Mrs.
Delia Leslie, who was pushed high by
her husband while swinging in a
swing in a vacant lot within a block
of the McDaniel home, the defense
asked:
"Did you scream when your hus
band pushed you high?"
"Yes, I did."
"Did you catch your breath?"
"Yes, I certainly did. I was scared."
The catching of the breath was
brought out by the defense which Is
seeking to account for the chocking
off of the screams, as testified to by
the state's witnesses.
"Can you give me a demonstration
of your screams on that night?" asked
Attorney Barker on cross-examination.
The witness replied that she was
afraid that she could not Barker
then laid the foundation of impeach
ment of witnesses by neighbors who
are said to have been sitting on the
porch less than a block from where
Mrs. Leslie testified she screamed. It
is said that they did not hear her.

EL PASO, Nov. 25. In terrific
rushes upon the first line trenches,
Villa began the third day of the strug
gle at Chihuahua City. At the same
time, cavalry charges were launched
upon the eastern, western and north
ern lines of the city and separate col
umns attempted to storm the gun em
placements upon Santa Rosa Hill,
dominating Chihuahua City from the
south. An official announcement at
the opening of the day's battle was
made by the Counsel Inspector Gen

By' United Press
WASHINGTON, Nov. 25 Only Gen
eral Carranza and General Villa today
stood as possible obstacles to the suc
cess of the Atlantic City agreement
for the withdrawal of Pershing's
forces. The American government it
self is prepared to ratify the portfolio,
in as much as it was shaped on the
request of President Wilson and he
has a'roved tne terms.
What Carranza will do is a prob
lem, although the administration be
lieves he will sign it, even though dis
tasteful, in spite of the fact that it
allow American troops to follow
forces into Mexico at any other time.
Villa may be eliminated by the Chi
huahua City battle, but those in touch
with the situation do not overlook the
disastrous results of a Villa victory.
Villa is an element in the situation
from the fact that withdrawal is con
ditional on conditions remaining satis
factory during the next four days. A
victory now would upset all plans.
Carranza probably will acquiesce, it
is thought here in the light of what
his representatives have been told.
During the past week American mem
bers of the commission have been
frank in telling the Mexican members
of what consequences they may ex
pect if they do not meet the Ameri
can terms.

GARDNER'S PLURALITY IS 263
Oficlal Returns Give Democrat Lead
Reed and Sullivan Victors.
By United Press
JEFFERSON CITY, Nov. 25. Colo
nel Frederick D. Gardner's official
plurality in the gubernatorial race is
2,263. The vote, as shown by official
returns from all parts of the state is:
Gardner, 382,355; Lamm, 380,092.
The official vote for United States
Senator is Reed, 396,166; Dickey, 371,

ficial count is Sullivan, 389,210, As
klns, 375,764.
Colonel Gardner is an interview in
St Louis yesterday regarding the fi
nancial condiUon of the state says:
"I am just feeling my way. That is
the best way to express my position.
But the first thing I will do will be to
ask the legislature for relief from the
present strained financial situation.
"I am beginning to believe we must
provide for an inheritance tax in addi
tion to the collateral inheritance tax,
which now goes to Missouri Univer
sity, and for a corporation tax. As a
guess, mind you I have not the fig
ures at hand to substantiate my pre
diction, I should say the state would
obtain a million dollars the first year
from an inheritance tax and the same
amount from a corporation tax, say
twenty-five or fifty cents a thousand.
"The state must be put on a firm fi
nancial basis. Here's the trouble:
Our general revenue, roughly, Is $5,
800,000. Two million dollars is im
mediately set aside for the public
schools, $400,000 goes into special
school funds, and 1-2 million dollars
goes to the state university. That Is
three million in all for educational
purposes, leaving 12,800,000 for the
state government of 3 1-2 million per
sons. "I want to see the state InsUtutiona

STATE RESTS IN LEWIS TRIAL
Unexpected Close Finishes St Louis
Murder TriaL
By United Press
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 25. The taking of
testimony, in the trial of Ora and Roy
Joe Lewis, charged with the murder
of Patrolman McKenna, came to a
sudden and unexpected close today
when the state rested the case and
the defense announced it would place
no more witnesses on the stand
The attorneys for the Lewis broth
ers first filed a demurrer to the in
dictment of Roy Joe on the grounds
that the state had not proved that he
participated in the crime. This was
overruled. A demurrer to the in
dictment of Ora was filed on allega
tion that the state had not submitted
sufficient evidence. When this also
had been overruled, the attorneys for
the defense petitioned that both
charges be removed on the grounds
that the evidence submitted in refer
ence to Dillon had no direct bearing
on the case. This demurrer was also
overruled.
The trial was adjourned for the
day by Judge Grimm who set 10 o'clock
Monday as the time for the next ses
sion.
TO CABLE KANSAS GAME RESULT
Friends of Three Alumni in Japan Will
' Send Turkey Day Score.
That the spirit of loyalty to "Old
Misson" is not dulled by the separation
of thousands of miles is indicated by
a recent letter received from Ralph H.
Turner, former editor of the Daily
Mlssourian. "Directly after the Missouri-Kansas
football game," Turner
writes, "run down to the foot of Mount
Oread at Lawrence, and cable me the
result of the big Turkey Day battle.
I know it's expensive, but Babb and I
can't wait for those slow moving
steamships. Anyhow there's a Kansas
lad over here and, if luck is with us
we are figuring on getting a little bet
with him."
In a later letter Turner says that
the Kansan refused to place any bet
with the three Missourlans, himself,
and Glenn Babb and Oscar E. Riley,
all graduates of the School of Journalism.
