ATHENS. Nov. IT.. (Via London.)
The first delivery of arms demanded
of (he Creek government by Admiral
Ju Foumet. commander of the entente
.HiiadiiMi. consists of ton batteries of
mountain guns. The demand declares
that failure to comply with it before
December 1. will result in measures
being taken by the admiral.
Admiral Du Fournet's latest note fix
ing a brief period in which Greek arms
;ire to be surrendered. greatly excited
the people of Athens. The premier in
formally explained that the admiral, in
reply to the government's refusal of his
demand, brushed aside the reasons for
his refusal and simply set 1'ecember 1
as the date for the surrender of the
sirtillery required and December IS as
the date for the surrender of the rifles.
The tone of the" note, said the premier,
did not admit discussion.
Admiral du Fournet's note, entente
diplomats say, reviews at length the
arguments of the Greek government
justifying this refusal to surrender
arms, refers again tn France's proporal
pay for the arms or replace them
ifter the war, declares that the entente '
powers do not make the demand be
cause they are in need of armamnt,
'but because they feel that the war ma
terial in Greece would tie better em
ployed in defendirg Macedonia "for the
liberty of which Hellenic blood has so
often been shed.'' than stored in the
arsenals.
An official close to the king has as
sured the Associated Press that the
surrender of arms no longer depends
on the sovereign of the government.
He declared that the king's best efforts
so far had proved fruitless with the
army, which is determined not to sur
render t:eir arms, notwithstanding the
wishe? of King Constantine.
Provisional Government Revolts

No Free Speech in Russia
HKJtLIN. Nov. 25. (By wireless to
the Associated Press, via Sayville. )
Dispatches from Stockholm report that
the P.ussian government Is preparing
to bring proceedings against Professor
Paul N. Miukoff. leader of the consti
tutional democrats, for his speech at
'he opening of the duma, in which he
touched upnn delicate points in Anglo
Russian relations and particularly uixm
the retirement of M. Sazannff as for
eign minister, which, according to
earlier reports, was strongly criticized '
oy the British ambassador as an act' of 1
perfidy toward the entente allies.
S. T. Waoun-Heret, vice president of
.the duma. w ho was in .the chair when
Professor Milukoff spoke. Is reported
to have tendered his resignation for
failing to prevent the incident.
Naval Battle Reported
LONTxrN. Nov. 25. The inhabitants
of I)eal, on the coast of Kent, south
east of London, says a Central News
dispatch, were aroused at midnight
Thursday by the sound of firinij at sea.
Crowds which lined the water front sa .v
flashes from guns In a northeasterly
direction, but the warships apparently
were 15 or 20 miles away. The hixmi
ing of the guns, the dispatch adds,
continued for twenty minutes, when
the sky darkened again and the people
returned to their beds.
Aiding Newspapers
BKBLIN. Nov. 2a. (Via London. p
1)r. Helfferich, secretary of the in
terior, during the discussion of the
budget before the committee if the
reichstag, communicated a suggestion !
looking to the suppression of some of
the newspapers. He said the govern
ment recognized the necessity of keep
ins; alive even the smaller newspaiwrs
during the war, and had ;lready taken
steps to facilitate their continuance.
Local officials showed want of ap
preciation of the importance of one
newspaper, he continued. This would
prove without significance, as all local
authorities could be controlled by uni
form instructions from the war office.
The doctor also discussed the question
utilizing the population of occupied i
territories for work in Germany within .
the provisions of international law. I
A progressist speaker suggested em-j
ploying Jews in Poland. I
jerieiMi i.oener, cnier or the muni
tions department, said that steps had
already b.n taken to bring them to
gether in special organizations. Ob
jections to the bill continued, one
i-peak-r t;aying that it would prove a
general rehearsal for a future socialist
vote, but a member of the socialist
seceders j ronounced the bill "the most
unheard of dictatorship measure ever
laid before the reichstag."
