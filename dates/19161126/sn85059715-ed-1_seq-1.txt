( V AltOCIATID PIMt)
CHARLESTON, Nov. 25.?House and
Seriate worked hard to bring about
final adjournment of the special session
of the legislature today, but the
plot went on the rocks when It became
evident that each was committed
to its own primary bill. The -House
was determined to open the way for a
modification of the primaries, while
the Senate went no ; further than to
allow the convention system In cities
of less than 20,000 population.
The House worked quickly in its
early session, passing the three Senate
bills before it and sending them to the
governor for his signature. It also
received the Senate primary and registration
measures, and for a little while
it looked as though some agreement
on the suspension of the rules would
be made and the governor's entire legislative
program completed. Mr.
Wertz, however, called up the House

Mr. Duty then called for the first
reading of the Senate registration bill,
after -which the suspension of the constitutional
provision for three separate
readings was voted upon, but on
motion of Mr. Duty announcement of
the vote was postponed until 5:15
o'clock, the House recessing until 5
o'clock. When
the House reconvened Delegate
Talbott rose to offer a resolution
but was opposed by Mr. Duty, the Republican
leader. He made another.;
AMERICA TO
PROTOCOL
4
Which Provides for the Withdrawal
of the American
Troops from Mexico.
CSV AICOCIATIO PMtM
WASHINGTON, Nov. 25.?-There appears
to be little doubt that the American
government will approve the principle
of the protocol signed at Atlantic
City yesterday by members of the Mexican-American
Joint committee providiner
for conditional withdrawal of the
American troops and for military control
of the border. President "Wilson
and Secretary Lansing began the study
of the protocol today, and while no
formal announcement will be made
until they have considered all the details,
other officials ' said the . agreement
followed the general ideas of the
administration.
The attitude of General Oarranza
toward the agreement is considered
here as more problematical. Alberto
J. Pani, one of the Mexican'members
of the Joint committee, will deliver it
to him at Queretaro and will make a
supplementary explanation of the attitude
of American commissioners.
Secretary Lane, who headed the
American . commissioners, was back at
his desk at the interior department
today but made no plans to see President
."Wilson- He .probably will discuss
Mexico with; him Monday or Tuesday,
but formal action by the administration
will not be hurried.because of the time

rose to a question of personal privilege,
but the resolution was not read, and
the House adjourned until Monday.
The resolution, it was stated, had to
do with an incident early in the day in.
which Governor Hatfield was said to
have ordered a witness before the bribery
investigation committee out of an
office which connects with the govcr
noirs suite.
- Senate Does Little. - " I
The Senate did very little. < In the
early session It passed the registration
hill and sent it over to the House.
"When it reconvened at 5 o'clock it was
notified that the'House . primary bill
had been sent over, and after tie usual
formality the bill was formally rejected.
The Senate: adjourned ; until
(Monday, when an effort will be made
to bring Senate and House together
on an acceptable primary measure.
Repeated efforts of Republican members
of the Senate to agree upon a
resolution to carry out the recommendation
of Governor Hatfield for a complete
investigation of alleged election
frauds, were made today, but no conclusion
had been reached tonight. Senator
Kosenbloom openly opposed any
resolution, wh'lo other senators wouiu
not- discuss the question publicly.
The senators spent the greater part
of the afternoon in President England's
room in the capital, where it was stated,
a resolution was freely discussed.
This resolution was said to provide
for the appointment of a committee
of three to sit at any place it might
select in the state to take testimony,
compelling the attendance of witnesses
and the production of documents. The
counties to be investigated were said
to be Brooke, Cabell, Logan, 'Marion,
Wayne and Webster.

between Cblhuabua City and Sauz,
the iirst station north, and now are
attacking the Htate capital from the
north,' It was believed by Carranza
officials here tonight.
Reports of refugees to the telegraph
operator at Sauz, relayed to
General Francisco Gonzales at military
headquarters, convinced the civil
and military officers that General Trevlno,
Carranza commander, still held
the-city, tonight at the close of the
three days' siege by Villa.
Are in the Dark.
Aside from this information the
commanding officers in Juarez were
as much in the dark tonight as to the
day's developments in the state capitals
as the Americans on the border.
The telegraph line has been silent
since before noon. Communication
with Chihuahua City was interrupted
soon after General Trevino Bent a
personal message to Mrs. Trevino assuring
her of his safety.
It is believed by Carranza military
officers that Villa has moved around
to the north and northeast of the
city, and is attacking from that side
in the hope of avoiding the curtain of
fire which the Carranzta artillery has
been pouring into the Tanks of the
bandits.
rtf- 1>wurw?.
Americans familiar with the topotrraphy
of Chihuahua City say Villa
will be able to make his way into the
city proper from the north without'
encountering artillery fire. This part
of the city Is said to be less strongly
fortlflefld than the Bouth, east or
west. ,
Before the telegraph line was cut
brief reports of the third day's battle
received by the military here told of
the preliminary skirmishing just before
dawn, which developed into a
general attack at 4:30 o'clock. The'
battle opened with the rifle flashes:
of the men in the first line trenches.
The machine guns, mounted on elevations
protecting! the main roads to
the city took up the refrain soon after
daybreak and the heavy artillery on
Santa Rosa hill; added its rumbling
to the din at sunrise. The assault
became general at' 7 o'clock, v with
the bandits attacking from , all sides,
according to the dispatches received
here. A repulse of Villa was reported
