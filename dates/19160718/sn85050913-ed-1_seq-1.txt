Manchester Press: In the south
part of Delaware county there ia a
neighborhood called Buck Creek. It
Is merely a farming neighborhood,
witbovtt even a store to dignify its
name: A llttie church Is located at
the croee roads, and that church is
preeided over by a minister whose
middle name is Enthusiasm. At an
ordinary morning Service the othe^r
8unday 300 people war* present «nd
the Sunday school of the church
boalta ea average attendance of 150.
Thil is aqual to the beet eff»ts of the
Ihrgeet Minchester churches, one
Sunday with another.
We doaft know just what Is respon

The spelling match held at the of
flee of the county superintendent
Saturday afternoon, resulted in Miss
Pearl Richey of Stanhope winning
first place, having spelled 193 words
out of two hundred correctly. Miss
Richey is now champion speller of
Hamilton county and will receive
trip to the atate fair, with expenses
paid, by the Hamilton County State
Bank. While at the fair, Miss Richey
who is about thirteen years of age,
will there be entitled to take part in
Miss Loia McAdow of this city,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. 4. W. Mc
Adow waa a close second, having
spelled 192 words correctly out of
two hundred words given the con
testants.
There were twelvd young people
who took part in the contest, which
wss open to all students of city and
Country schools who were not mem
ben of any grade higher than the
eighth. Stanhope sent one contest
ant, Stratford one, Blalrsburg four
and'Webster City, six.
.The' work' was all very creditable
and the fact that two young girls
not over fourteen years of age spel
led so many words correctly on so
hot a day, is a decidedly splendid
evidence' of their good scholarship.
