Royal Clemency is Only Hope

I:ternntl Mini News Service:
LONDON". -Inly IS. Tho appeal of
Sir Roger Casement from his con
viction on the charge of high trea
son was dismissed in the riminal
court of appeals today.
Casement must die unless King
George ntervenes in his behalf.
Arguments in behalf of the ap
pellant were conclude.! this morning
by Alexander Sullivan. K. C. chief of
counsel for Casement.
A streng appeal was made for lhe
convictei man, Mr. Sullivan citing
many quotations from the ancient
law to sustain his contentions.
The chief points advanced by the
counsellor were not taken hy the
court and when the argument whs
in, the court lost little time in hand
ing down its decision.
Justlc; Darling presided, and with
him sat Justice Bray, Scrutton. Law
rence arid Atkin.
Vhn the proceedings were re
sumed trie court room was crowded,
the spectators listening with the;
deepest interest to the learned ad
dress of Casement's counsel.
Do liter Judgement Soon.
In the- contiunation of his speech
Mr. Sullivan argued that the offense
charged under the statute under
which the indictment was drawn
could net exist because it was com
mitted outside of the realm of the
king's dominions.
Mr. Sullivan conclude-l his ad
dress at noon and immediately the
judges retired. Within a few min
utes they returned to the bench and
the couit proceeded to deliver its
Judgment without calling upon the
crown to reply.
Casement, who was found guilty
on June was sentenced to death
by hanging. The appeal was not di
rected against the death sentence,
however, but against the conviction
and was based on legal points.
I aids Court Rights.
Michael K. Ioyle of Philadelphia,
advisory counsel for Casement,
made the following statement after
the court had rejected the appeal:
"Today's decision concludes Case
ment's r ghts in court unless the
case is taen inte the house of lords.
In view of the fact that the attor
ney general was not called upon to
reply to the defense's arguments,
this is unlikely as the attorney gen
eral has to give permission for fur
ther appeal. This decision is the
first clear interpretation of th an
cient statute relating to high trea- i
son. "if)) years old. Powerful influ-
ences ar at work to secure a re- j
prieve which we expect will be sue- ;
cessful. Casement continues c heer
