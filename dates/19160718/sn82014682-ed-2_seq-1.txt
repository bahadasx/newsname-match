UNDER PROTEST
Emphatic dissatisfaction with the
make-up of the Republican territorial
and executive committees is voiced in
Republican circles. A. D. Cooper,
chairman of the general platform com
mittee, this afternoon made the fol
lowing statement:
"On all sides I have heard great
dissatisfaction expressed at the selec
tion made from the fourth and fifth
districts for members of the central
and executive committees. It seems
quite inconsistent on the part of del-
egates to a convention which acquit
ted itself with the adoption of what
is .generally conceded to be one of
the most constructive; progressive
and best all-around platforms ever
submitted to the electorate, to con
clude its labors in this manner. The
majority of the members of the com
mittees from this island were quite
evidently chosen without consultation
with the party leaders, and apparent
ly without due consideration of fac
tors that should enter into such selec
tion. In fact in a number of instances
those chosen are unable to serve and
have asked to have others selected

Honolulu's opportunities for the
