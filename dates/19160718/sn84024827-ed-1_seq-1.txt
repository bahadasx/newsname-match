Tactical Success By Rus

. (By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON". July 17. The sucesses
of the entente allies are following
each other with great rapidity. Today
fcrought news of further important
gains for them on both the western
and eastern fronts, arousing enthu
siasm among1 the Btklsh public hard
ly less than that caused by the re
ception of the first news of allied
offensive.
The dispatches said General iSl
Douglas Haig today shows that the
steady pressure of the British arms
is forcing an ever-deepening salient
into the German lines and the com-mander-inchief
for the first time pro
duces evidence in the shape "of docu
ments captured from the Germans giv
ing testimony as to ihe high price the
Germans are paying In casualties.
British Gain Mile .
The British have improved their
position along almost the whole of
their line on the battle front, captur
ing by assault 1,500 yards of Ger
man second line positions north of
the Bazentin-le-Petit wood, strong
German position at the Waterlot long
te.tween Longueval and Gutllemont,
besides completing the capture of the
whole of the village of Ovilles-la.-Boisselle.
These gains bring the Brit
ish almost af the crest of Albert
plateau, where stretches the German
third line.
Big Russ Offensive
The news from the eastern front
today was equally important. The
Russian commander, General Kuro
patkin, has launched an offensive
against Field Marshal von Hindenburg
on the Dvina River and General von
Linsingen's troops southwest of Lutsk
have been compelled to retire behind
the Lipa river, while in the course
of Sunday's fighting in Volhynia the
Russians captured an additional 13,
000 prisoners and thirty guns. Gen
eral von Linsingen's retirement, ac
cording to the Petrograd military
critics, represents a great Russian
tactical success. It was preceded by
heavy fighting in which the Russians
smashed the Teuton front on a width
of a mile and penetrated several miles
into their positions.
$30,000,000 Daily
The war now is costing Great Brit
ain 6.000,000 pounds sterling daily
but with such news as the successes
of the entente, this sacrifice is no
where grudged.
While the powers of endurance of
the Teutonic allies, should they be
forced to act entirely on the defensive,
have still to be tested, the British
natioi; is full of confidence. It
taking nothing for granted, however,
but Is fully prepared to acquiesce In
the advice of its leading ministers,
like Foreign Secretary Grey and
Chalmers of the Exchequer Mc Ken
na, who are publicly exhorting the
nation to the need of patience. Mr.
McKenr.a to;d the bouse of commons
today that nobody could estimate
what the nation's war expenses might
be a inonth ehead. He also intii-ate-l
that it would become necessary this
week to ask parliament from their bor
rowing powers.

ST. PAUL. July 17. Prohibition
party leaders admitted tonight that
their plans for a get-together confer
ence in St. Paul tomorrow, which
they had hoped would bring into their
organization a throng of Progressives,
Republicans and Democrats, seemed
destined to come to naught. Instead
of a get-together affair the meeting
promised to develop merely into a
Prohibition love feast and experience
meeting with little or no political sig
nificance. Supporters of J." Frank Hanly's can
didacy for the presidential nomination
had difficulty in concealing a feeling
of glee over the failure of leaders in
other parties to flock to the Prohibi
tion get-together meeting. National
Chairman Virgil G. Hinshaw, who has
had charge of the arrangements for
the conference, said tonight he could
make no forecast for the detached
members of parties that they woul at
tend. Only one of these had arrived
In St. Paul tonight. He is James M.
Ingersoll, of Pocatello, Idaho, member
from the state of the Progressive na
tional committee.
Mr. Stewart declared that the Indi
ana man is the strongest possible can
didate the Prohibition party could
name. Second to him Mr. Stewart
placed Eugene N. Foss. former gover
nor of Massachusetts. He declined to
discuss Wm. Sultzer of New York as
a candidate.
At the conclusion of tonight's ses
sion of the executive committee of
the Prohibition national convention, a
telegram was sent to John M. Parker
of New Orleans, by Robert Patton, na
tional committeeman from Illinois and
H. P. Faris of Clinton, Missouri,
treasurer of the national committee.
The message follows:
"Will you accept the nomination
for vice president on the Prohibition
ticket. Some of our delegates pre
favorable to your nomination if yon
will accept and believe your accept
ance will be a great step toward unity.
Please wire fully where you stand."

(3y Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, July 17. Tomorrow the
Eritish government will publish a list
of from 50 to 80 business firms and
individuals domiciled in the United
States v-ith which residents of the
United Kingdom are forbidden to deal.
T!.is will be the first time that any
American has been placed on the
statutory list which is- better known
as the "trading with the enemy act
blacklist." All other countries have
been represented on the list for some
time.
Laming Worthington Evans, con
troller of the foreign trade depart
ment of the foreign office today gave
the Associated Press the following
explanation of the latest extension of
the trading with the enemy act:
Opening Other Countries
"It has been the policy of the Brit
ish government in th, past to follow
the theory that in forbidding its sub
jects to trade with an enemy, that en
emies domiciled In friendly countries
did not come under the act. France
and various other countries hold the
doctrine that their nationals cannot
trade with, an enemy, no matter what
his domicile. Modern conditions of
credit and commerce make it possi
ble for an enemy outside belligerent
territory to trade with his country.
Therefore a considerable body of
opinion in this country urged the gov
ernment to abandon its traditional
doctrine, and the foreign office, while
not going to this extreme, decided
simply to prohibit persons domiciled
in the United Kingdom from trading
with a limited number of individuals,
firms or companies of enemy nation
ality or associating under the same
penalties as though they were trad
ing with an enemy." .
Justifies Viewpoint
The statement continues:
"It will be clear that this policy em
bodied In the recent act Is purely a
piece of domestic legislation which
only interferes with trade, even In thei
cases of specified concerns, by prohib
iting persons domiciled In the United
Kingdom from dealing with these con
cerns. It is a consequence simply and
solely, of the right of the state to lira
it or control. In the interests of the
state, the trade relations with Its own
subjects. As regards the United
States list, this may roughly be di
vided into four classes:
Reasons Mostly German

was ever spent by any nation In tho
world, despite the fact that "it Is ve-
ry possible that before this European j
war is over the United States, with
out the construction of a single ship,
will have the greatest navy in the
world."
Senator Vardaman declared ron
(gress was yielding to hysteria. Sen
ator Thomas opposed the construction
of so many big ships "rd urged that
submarines and aircraft would be suf-J
ficient protection for a nation which
does not contemplate offensive war
fare. Senator Works predicted that
passage of the naval bill would nave
a marked change In military policy
that would overturn the peaceful sup
port of America. '
Senators Lewis (Democrat) and
Borah. Weeks and Kenyon (Republi
can.?) spoke in favor of the measure.

BALTIMORE. July 17. There were
many indications tonight that the sub
marine merchantman Deutschland
would be ready to sail tomorrow. .
The tug Thomas F. Timmins. which
towed the submersible to Baltimore
from the capes, coaled this afternoon.
Capt. F. Hinsch of the interned North
German Lloyd Neckar, who has charge
of the Ttmmlns when she picked up
the Deutschland. was seen on the
Timmins just before she left the dock
to take on coal.
Shortly before 3o'clock this after
noon Theadore Mottu, foreman of the
grand jury accompanied by the chief
of police, came to the pier to where
the Deutschland is berthed and was
permitted to view the submarine from
the deck of the Neckar. Captain
Hinsch said he regretted that he could
not issue a pass to go aboard the
Deutschland, but it had been decided
not to allow any more visitors.
Officials of the Eastern Forwarding
Company would give no information
concerning the sailing of the Deutsch
land or as to how far the stowing of
the cargo has proceeded.
Nickel For Ballast
It Is thought, however, that a quan
tity of nickel, which will do duty as
ballast as well as form a part of the
cargo, has been taken aboard. Most
of the rubber that is to be taken to
Germany is thought to be in the ves
sel's hold.
Fainted Color Of Sea
The painting of the Deut sell land's
hull so that it harmonizes with the
waters of the Atlantic, even to the
white caps has been completed. To
night the tug Timmins and the launch
Efio are patrolling the river In the
vicinity of the submarine and playing
their searchlights In all directions.

Senator Borah urged that if the Un
ited States was to enjoy the blessings
of peace It must convince the world
It is prepared for war.
Declaring that the United States
has not a friend among the nations.
Senator Lewis pleaded that the peo
ple be told the frank truth about for
