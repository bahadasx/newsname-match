PETROGRAD, July 18. The Rus
sians have gained a victory over the
Teutons in southern Volhynla which
resulted in the latter being driven
across the Lipa and beyond the
stream, says the War office. The
Indications are, the statement con
tinued, that the retirement was ef
fected in the greatest disorder.
The much talked of suit to teHt the
constitutionality of the present elec
tion law was filed with the clerk of
the supreme court this morning, says
the Carson Ajnppal. The suit is
brought in the name of Dewitt C.
Turner as plaintiff and is directed
against V. A. Fogg, county clerk of
Washoe county, and A. E. Wilson,
county clerk of Churchill county, and
seeks by way of injunction and writ
of prohibition to prohibit the defend
ants from proceeding in any way to
comply with the present primary law.
In the complaint the act is claimed
to be wholly null and void and wholly
unconstitutional, in that the title is
imperfect; that it is impossible of
execution and enforcement; that it
deprives plaintiff and other qualified
voters of Nevada of the right of
suffrage guaranteed them by the con
stitution; that the plaintiff now is and
