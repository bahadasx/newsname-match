Repulsed Teutonic Raid on
Hill 304—Russians are
Still Advancing.
Very little news of any importancei
came from either front today. The
Germans, in the official statement this
afternoon, claimed successes against
the British and French forces, and
the French official announcement ad
mitted that the Teutonic foroes had
gaind some ground. The English
statement, however, made no such ad
missions. claiming, on the other hand,
that substantial gains continued all
along the British front.
It is certain, however, that during,
the past 24 hours, the French troops
have been more active and have
made more gains that their English
Nallies or their Teutonic enemies. On
tlve Verdun front, the French broke
up'xi terrific German raid on Hill 804,
while in grenade fighting east of the
river they had all the advantage over
the Germans.
The Italians reported advances
against the Austrians, despite vigorous
counter attacks.
No word came from the Russian
field today, although it is evident that
the Muscovites are as active as ever
and still are gaining against the
Teutons.

the Entente Allies are following each
other with great rapidity. Today

gains for them on both western and
eastern fronts, arousing enthusiasm
among the British public hardly less
than that caused by the reception of
the first news of the Allied offensive.
The dispatch of General Sir Doug

an ever-deepening salient into the
German lines, and the commander in
chief for the first time produces evi
dence in the shape of documents-cap

mony as to the high price the Ger

The British have improved tbelr
position along almost the whole- of
their line of battle-front, capturing-by

line positions north of the Baeentln
Le-Petit wood, a,strong German po
sitton at.the Waterlot farm between
Longueval and GuiBemont, besides
completing the capture of the whole
of the viUhge of Drillers la Boisetle.
These gains bring the British almost
