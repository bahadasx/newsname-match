This packet line proved a financial
{allure because of the enormous
overhead expense of operating such

lis full capacity of freight. This old
steamer required about 35 men to
inerate it whether loaded or empty,
t was comparatively slow and more
time was consumed In landing than
?would be required by a modern gsjso

ClOb!d
Campaign to Raise $2,000
Before September 1 Has
Been Started.
Under the leadership of the pastor, I
Rev. J. B. Workman, the trustees of
Diamond Street M. E. church have I
entered upon a short campaign by
?which it is proposed to raise $2,000,
?which with a few collectible pledges
already in hand, will be sufficient to
?wipe out thS entire Indebtedness
against the splendid church building
owned by that congregation.
Bight leaders have been chosen
wbt> are to lie captains of eight com
panies into which tho membership
of the church has been divided.
Bach company Is expected to raise at
least (250 by the flrst of September.
With such a division of the work it
?would seem that the money can be
lly realized, and tho church year
" id with all obligations fully met.
.each leader doubtless will form an
organization within his own company
ao that the entire constituency of the
church* can be esally enlisted In the
campaign. Many friends outside the
membership of the church It is ex
pected will help out In the work, and
this growing and aggressive church
?will be freed from debt.
The leaders selected by the Board
of-Trustees are as follows: Co.No. 1,
IjftLv Coogle; Co. No. 2, H. J. McEl
fresh; Co. No. 3, J. H. Leonard; Co.
M$N<?4, J. B. Crowl; Co-i.No. 6, M. L.
f West; Co. No. 6, H. E. Hawkins; Co.
No. 7. w. Clark Snyder; Co. No. 8,
Guy McDougal. .
The present purpose of- the churcn
Is to close this campaign with a week
of jubilee services early In Septem
ber, at which time former pastors of
the church will be present. Former
members of this old congregation
?will visit the scenes of other years
and a real reunion will take place.
teA mass meeting of the church and
congregation will be held next Mon
day night, which will be addressed
by happy speakers and following this
teetlng the various companies will
feet separately and organize for the
irk to be done.
NOTICE.
Consumers of city water are noti
fied that an.impure condition in
the water prevails at this time and
boiling water for drinking purpos
es is recomm untied by the City
Health department. The impurity
will probably be corrected within a
cesBful. C. D. Robinson, who acted
as treasurer (or the company, is an
other local man who, although heavi
ly hit by the failure of the packet
line, is still Interested In the river
question. Speaking today of the
river transportation question, Mr. Ja
cobs said:
"While I do not think that there
Is any immediate danger of the gov
ernment abandoning the locks on the
upper Monongahela, I do think that
the problem should be taken up
again and thoroughly worked out.
One point that I want to emphasize
is that the people of Fairmont by
themselves can not revive the river
traffic. We must secure the cooper
ation of all of the towns along the
river and especially Pittsburgh. With
out the cooperation and the good will
of the Pittsburgh jobbers and manu
facturers who ship the majority of
the freight that comes to this region,
we can do nothing. We had trouble
before because many times the goods
Were ordered shipped by boat the
jobbers would send It by rail.
"If Fairmont can secure the pro
per cooperation from the other cities
along the Monongahola I think Pitts
burgh can be brought to see the ad
vantages of keeping the river open to
navigation. Of course the agitation
and beginning of the movement lor
the revival of river traffic must begin
somewhere, and Fairmont, at the
ject and we can gain a great amount
of valuable advertising for our city if
we are able successfully to carry out
the matter, and I think we can do
that."
Sent Rain to Put Stop to All
Volunteer Road
Work.
July 18 and 19 designated as good
"roads days" by the Gorvernor, are
morely to prove "bad roads days"
since the county engineer sttaes that
the continued rain has made work ou
tho roads almost impossible. Even
if the weather had been dry and fair
it is thought that but few men could
have beon obtained for the work as
practically all of the farmers of the
county are r#ow in the midst of their
harvest Rain during the two days set
apart in May as "Good Roads" days
also prevented any work being done
at that time.
County engineer Wilfong stated to
day that as soon as the rain stopped
the supervisors of the road in the
various districts would immediately
go out with drags and that after a day
or so of Bunshino the dirt roads of. the
county probably would be in better
shape than before.
Most disappointed of all tho good
roads enthusiasts were tho suffrage
workers of the state. These esti
miable ladies to show their public
spirit and for their share of the help
toward "good roads" had planned to
provide lunches and refreshments for
the tired and sweating citizens who
labored on the roads for this state
and nation.
It is likely that two other days
will be named later in the season as
"Good Roads" days, because of the
failure of the two previous attempts
caused by rain. Should other days
be proclaimed by the Governor they
will ligely be after the harvest is
over and before the fall rains be
gin.
