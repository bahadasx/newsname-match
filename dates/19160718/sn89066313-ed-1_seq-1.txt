"l.oe your fellow men sincerely,
"Art from honest motives purely,
"Trust in !o.l and Heaven securely."
These lines by Vnn Dyke furnished
the text of the lecture at the chau-
tamiua last night by Dr. Daniel F.
Fox. Taking a line at a time as his
theme. Doctor Fox elaborated on
each, interpreting them in the light
of present-day conditions and prob
lems. By way of introduction the speaker
said this was his second Chautauqua
address in Columbia. Years ago, he
said, he gave an address at the fair
grounds. The trouble with most persons is
that they don't think, said Doctor
Fox. Slost of us never actually think
if we can possibly avoid it. The old
saying, "a penny for your thoughts,"
has more meaning today than ever,
he said, but it should read "a million
for your thoughts," for the world to
day is willing to pay a fortune for
one good idea.
"Success," said Doctor Fox, "is get
ting what you want, when you want
it, the way you want it, as long as you
want it."
"Love your fellow men sincerely."
The speaker said we have overdevel
oped the material side of life and
have been slow in developing a
brotherhood. "We are building 42-cen-timctcr
guns and only 2-centimeter
men, he said.
Looks Forvtard to Arbitration.
Doctor Fox believes the time will
come when men will no more think
of settling their differences on the
battlefield than they would revert
back to slavery and witchcraft. There
will be instituted an international su
preme court, he believes, where ques
tions will be arbitrated.
"Act from honest motives purely."
The speaker pointed out that just as
good baseball teams are not made
without team work, so in life we fail
many times because of lack of team
work. We do not act from honest
motives. It takes real courage, he
said, for a man who, finding himself
mistaken, seeks to correct himself.
"Trust in God and Heaven secure
ly." In concluding, Doctor Fox traced
briefly the life of Lincoln, showing
step by step how his life was illus
trative of the four lines by Van Dyke,
the text.
The Westminster Concert Enter
tainers pleased again last night. One
of the features was the work of Sliss
Dorothy Cole. Her humorous read
ings were well received, and she was
recalled three times. Sliss Mary SIo
rasco sang "One Fine Day" from Puc
cini s ".Madame Butterfly' In Japa
nese costume, and Sliss Vivian Sliller
sang a group of popular Irish folk
songs in Irish costume.
Rain Interferes With Program.
The Chautauqua program yesterday
afternoon was punctuated frequently
by rain and thunder. The crowd,
however, came well prepared, raised
umbrellas in the tent and applauded
both the roar of the rain and the ef
forts of the entertainers to make
themselves heard. For a while the
efforts of one of the tent men to close
a gap in the tent roof while he was
being thoroughly drenched furnished
amusement for the audience, and
when the storm had subsided suf
ficiently the Westminster Entertain
ers opened the program with a song
entitled "Little Drops of Water." In
spite of interruptions the program
was finally completed. Alf Taylor of
Tennessee was the speaker of the aft
ernoon. His eloquence in "A View
of the Outlook" seemed only increas
ed by the thunder claps.

6 DEAD, 3 WOUNDED
IN CHICAGO BATTLE
Nejrro and Wife Hold Off
Police With Dynamite,
Rifles and Pistols.
IN CENTER OF CITY
Crazed Murderer Is Finally
Killed After 100 Are in
the Conflict.
Ity I'niti-d Press.
CHICAGO. July IS. A desperate
battle with dynamite, rilles and auto
matic revolvers raged for hours today
in tile heart of Chicago's populous
West Side.
When the roll of the dynamite and
the crackle of the firearms had died
away, six persons were dead and three
wounded.
Henry Siclntyre. negro, apparently
crazed with heat, with his wife at his
side, stood off the mobilized police
force of the city and replied, shot for
shot, to the besiegers.
Sirs. Siclntyre died beside her hus
band. She was foutij dead when De
tective Sergeant Hughes broke
through the line of besiegers and
reaching the door-way opened lire up
on the negro as he stood beside a win
dow, firing at the police who were be
hind telephone poles.
The dead arc: Sirs. Joseph Over
meyer, white: Stuart Dean, policeman,
white: Henry Siclntyre, negro; Harry
Knox, negro; Alfred Matthews, negro,
ami Sirs. Hattie Siclntyre. negro.
The wounded: Kd Clemons, police
man, white: Graver Crabtree. police
man, white, and Sirs. Harry Knox, ne
gro. Fires on II is Neighbors.
Siclntyre came into his yard early
today, rille in hand. He opened lire on
adjoining residences and shot down
their occupants as fast as they ap
peared at doorways and windows. Sirs.
Overmeycr, with a baby in her arms,
was killed by a rifle shot as she came
upon her porch.
The alarm spread quickly over the
West Side. Harry Knox and his wife
came into their doorway and looked
out into the yard where Siclntyre was
dealing death-blows. Both were shot.
Knox died, and his wife was wounded.
Half a block down the street, which
is occupied largely by blacks, Alfred
Matthews, another negro, came to his
doorstep. One of SIcIntyrc's bullets
went through his head, and he fell on
the sidewalk. His body lay there for
hours while bullets whistled over it.
Then the police came. Dean, a vet
eran of the force, walked calmly Into
the doorway. Siclntyre shot him dead,
demons and Crabtree stepped over his
body and tried to dra.g it out of the
way. Both fell, seriously wounded.
The remainder of the police dragged
the bodies of the wounded men out
of range. Then they posted themselves
behind telephone poles, corners of
houses and other temporary shelter.
while reserves were brought up.
1110 Policenicn on Scene.
One hundred policemen soon were in
the blcck, armed with rifles and auto
matics. From his fortress, Siclntyre
kept up a constant lire upon his be
siegers. Close at hand was a quarry. Police
ment went for dynamite and quarry
men to handle it. Sticks of the dyna
mite were hurled through the windows.
but exploded without harming Sicln
tyre. Quarrymen, protected by an over
whelming rifle fire, dug under the
houes and set off four charges, badly
shattering the building, but apparently
not injuring Siclntyre, who dodged
from window to window, keeping up
a steady fire.
Then Detective Hughes walked In,
protected by a heavy fire, and shot Sic
lntyre down. Beside Siclntyre as he
fell lay the body of his wife, shot
through the head. Around her waist
was a belt filled with steel-nosed bul
lets from a Springfield 30-30 that Sic
lntyre had dropped as he fell dead. On
the table beside Siclntyre lay an au
tomatic. It is not known whether Sic
lntyre shot his wife when he found
that capture was Inevitable or whether
she was killed by a policeman's bul
let. Siclntyre died at the hospital.
