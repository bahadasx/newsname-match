Webb i overruled the. demurrer' filed by

, depositors were entitled to participate

After the Burr "A: Knapp failure In
; . 1914 it was found that the firm, had a
110,00 bond filed In- accordance with
he state law to protect depositors in
private banking firms. , The surety
j company delayed making good on the
bond so suit was brought by the State
of Connecticut and several depositors.
. Counsel for the surety company
... then filed a demurrer on various legal
- "(grounds. They, claimed' the proceeds
of the bond were not an asset of the
. bank and that the .dividend from, the
..; bonds would not be sufficient to com
pensate the depositors for their losses.
Xt was also alleged that Trustee John

CASEMENT MUST
DIE, RULING OF
APPEALS COURT
Verdict of Lower Court,
Holding Irish Knight
Guilty of Treason.
ATTORNEYS OF CROWN
OFFER NO ADDRESSES
Final Decision is' Handed
Down After Rebel's Coun
sel Concludes Speech.
London, July 18 Without hearing
the attorneys for the Crown, the court
of criminal appeal today dismissed
Sir Roger Casement's appeal from the
verdict of the lower court which
found him guilty of treason, for
which Viscount Reading, the Lord
Chief Justice, sentenced him to death.
For a day and a half, Alexander
Sullivan, Sir Roger's counsel, urged
before the court, quoting many au
thorities in favor of his ' contention
that the offense of treason depended
upon whether the accused dwelt un
der the protection of the King and
that the crime could not be' commit
ted without the realm. He abandoned
Jiis other points -in regard to the Lord
Chief Justice's definition of the of
fense. ,
As soon as Mr. Sullivan had con
cluded his argument the Court retired
to consider (whether the attorneys for
the Crown would be called on to re
ply. It soon decided to the contrary
which indicated! that the appeal had
gone against Sir Roger who was
present during the argument and
when judgment was given.
- ' A further appeal, to the House of
Lords, is possible only if the attorney
general gives the certificate that the
decision of the court of criminal ap
peal involves a point of law so excep
tionally important' that it is desirs
ble to the public interest that a still
higher , court should deal with It This
has been done only twice since the
court of criminal appeal was estab
lished eight years ago. . i
Justice Darling, in delivering the
judgment expressed the Indebtedness
of the court to Mr. Sullivan for. his
well-considered and well-delivered
arguments, as the Justice" characteriz
ed them, adding: that they "were
worthy of the best traditions of the
Kings couftsibnt he neclared bat
they were answered by the attorneys
for the Crown at the first trial." . .
Attorney. Michael Francis Doyle, of
Philadelphia, of .counsel for Sir Roger,
expressed the opinion today that It
was not probable that the attorney
general would certify the case for ap
peal for the House ofv Lords as the
appeal court did not consider It neces
sary to hear argument for the gov
ernment
Powerful influences are working for
reprieve, said the attorney, and there
are strong hopes of Its being grant
