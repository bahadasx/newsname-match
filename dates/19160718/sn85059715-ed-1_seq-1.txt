Mr. Ilaker, with Andrew j. ic,yj

tho case of the Itaker appojntment,
whose renomlnation had already bPen
opposed in a letter sent to the presij

{ attitude toward Mr. Baker is based
on the claim that this member was
placed in the same category with
General Smith, former head of the
excise board, by the findings of the
Senate committee which investigated
the actions of tho excise board. Ilowever,
the Bakers have fared pretty

DID II RAIN?
Well, if You Don't Think So,
Just Ask George A. Custer,
of Monticello.
Ton much rain is enough. In the
opinion of George A. Custer, well
known Harrison county farmer, wno
resides in ..Monticello addition to the
| city. When Tuesday morning came
[ around, Mr. Cuter walked out on his
I tiack porch, took a squint at the sky
and decided that there would be no
more rain. And so with visions of
blackberry pic dancing before him, he
I went forth to the fields with his buckets.
Three hours later Mr. Cuter returned
home, drenched to the skin. When
members of the family asked him about
the berries, he mumbled something
inaudible and walked around the corner
of the house.
There were no blackberry pies on
i the Custer table at lunch.

these were the light and inexpensive
tractors. Those tractors are light
enough to spare bridges and culverts. 1
They will not pack the well-tilled
land, and yet they are powerful
enough to plow to a depth of eight
or nine inches. The trnctor turns up
