ANTI-AERO GUNS
BEING SUPPLIED
TO U. S. NAVI
Washington Factory Ready t<
Eqip Whole Fleet, Says
Department.
Battleships of the Atlantic Fleet ar
being equipped with 3-inch rapid-fir
anti-aircraft guns. recently completed a
the gun factory of the Washington Nav
Yard. The guns have already bee
mounted on the battleships Pennsylvani
and Nevada. The design of the nc%
weapon was drawn up by the Bureau u
Ordnance of the Navy Department.
Forty of the guns are already leanu
factured and tested. The Importance o
this, according to the Navy Department
lies in the fact that the United State
navy is now in position to provide anti
aircraft guns by the thousands and a
short notice in case of war or ener
gency. The guns can be mounted In sky
scrapers or church towers as effectival
here as they have been used on hig
buildings abroad.
Until recently the United States had n
defense against aeroplanes. Rear Ad
miral Straus. chief of the Bureau of Ord
nance. realized that the fleet would b
at a distinct disadvantage against a:
enemy fleet which carried aeroplanes fo
the reason that these craft could oper
ate unmolested over our naval forces. I
is now a simple matter, It Is explained
for warships to carry aircraft aboar
ship and launch them from the decks.
