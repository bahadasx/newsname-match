By William Philip Simms.
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Petrograd, June 19.(By mail)
"War is not at all bad," pastor Chas.
Wagner, author of "The Simple Life,"
declared to me in the course of a
Paris interview, December, 1914.
And when I asked him to go on
and explain, he said:
"Out of this turmoil and slaughter
a few blessings are bound to emerge,
like lilies from the sand of a pond.
For one thing I can see a return from
a highly material, to a more spirit
ual form of everyday life. For" an
other I believe the minds of the
masses will be lifted by the war to
a vision of bigger things.
"No man can through such an ex
perience and remain the petty crea
ture he was at the beginning. He
can not go back to his awl and his
last anjl pick up bristle and thread
just-where he left off.
"War hardens, but war educates
one must be different afterward one
must be wiser.
War Educates People.
The pastor-philosopher was not
speaking of the soldiers of France
alone. He included all peoples af
fected by the warthe Englishthe
Frenchthe Germanstjie Aus
trians and the Russians.
His inference was that France will
be a different country after the war.
So Will Germany and England and
Russia and all the others.
Russia is bound to be a new Rus
sia. That is one of the things the
war means to this mighty empire. If
western Europe will be changed
through this Armageddon, how much
more so will the Europe of the east
where the people are comparatively
young. These are the things im
plied by Pastor Wagner..
Russia, in fact, has already chang
ed, already started on the new road.
Russia Has Chance.
The American coming to Russia ex
pects to find things much more cen
tralized than in France or England.
He expects to see the government
working independently, above and
apart from the people because in the
past the government has played the
part of the parent looking after the
needs of the child, or the people. To

his surprise he observes nothing of
the kind.
He finds the Russian people work
ing for and with the government.
He discovers two great armies in
the land, one in uniform, under arms,
fighting. The other in plain clothes,
or overalls, at bench and lathe, work
ing. The government's agent, the
general staff, commands both and co
ordinates their efforts.
Through their All-Russian Zemstvo
Union, their All-Russian Municipality
Union, their central committee, their
war industry committees, their co-op
erative societies and kindred organi
zations, Russian plain people and
Russian gentry are working hand in
hand, collaborating with the govern
ment and army for the good of the
country at large and for victory.
People are Eager.
Never before have the people shown
such an eagerness to do public ser
vice and never before have they dis
played such an aptitude for it.
No one here makes any secret of
these things. I have talked to many
people high and low and the facts
which I have attempted to set down
in this series of articles are recog
nized as showing the new trend in
Russia.
"War hardens, but war educates,"
said Wagner. And it "lifts the minds
of the masses to higher visions."
One -can see it working out here
in Rusisa, even with the naked eye.
The people have demanded to be put
to work for the public good. Jobs
have been given them, they have set
to work and already they love it.
BATH HOUSES AT POINT
ARE HEARING COMPLETION
The new bath houses, being con
structed at Diamond Point, are nearly
completed. They are already being
used by the bathers. Hundreds of
bathers are at Diamond Point every
day.
A. A. Carter, who has had charge
of the construction of the bath
houses, has constructed a soft drink,
ice cream, cigars and confectionery

Fire, which originated at about

caused about $3,000 loss to the Be

the company's crew and the Bemidji

The fire is believed to have been
caused by friction.
The entire loss was covered by in

It will not cause a delay in the
