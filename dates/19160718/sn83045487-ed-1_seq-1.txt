BOYNE STRIKES BLOW
AT AUTOJLAYERS
Big Business Hit by State's Attorney's Crusade Against
Drivers of Auto Trucks and Joy Riders 134
Killed by Autos Since Jan. 1, 1916.
Reckless joy riders and time-killing
drivers of big auto trucks are to
be the target of a campaign by
State's Att'y Hoyne. 134 men, wom
en and children have been crushed to
death in Chicago streets since Jan.
1, 1916. It is these figures that have
aroused Hoyne.
The prosecutor has indicated that
the crusade may hit the State street
stores, the newspaper trust, etc., but
the guilty will be brought to justice.
"I have ordered my assistants to
bring indictments against any man
responsible for auto killings," said
Hoyne.. "I don't care who is hifby
itl Chicago streets are no longer
safe. Drivers for big commercial in
stitutions are responsible for just as
many deaths as reckless and drunk
en speed maniacs. A man who kills
a person by lawless driving is just as
guilty of intent as a man who kills
with a revolver. My assistants will
ask for the extreme penalty in the
case of every man brought to trial."
