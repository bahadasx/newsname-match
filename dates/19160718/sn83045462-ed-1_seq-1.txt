AFTER KILUNG FOUR
Negro Religious Fanatic and
Chicago Police Exchange
Hundreds of Shots.
THREE PERSONS HURT
IN DESPERATE FIGHT
Home of Crazed Man Dynamited

Before Struggle Ends.
CHICAGO. July 18.?A negro
religious fanatic becoming violently
insane today shot four
persons to death, wounded three

the house in which he was
barricaded.
The dead: Stuart Dean, sixty years
old. policeman: Mrs. Josephine Overmeyer.
twenty-eight years old. neighbor;
Edward Knox, thirty-four years
old. negro, neighbor: Alfred Mathews,
thirty years old. negro, neighbor; H.
J. Mclntyre, negro, the crazed man.
thirty years old: Mrs. Hattie Mclntyre,
negress. wife of the slayer, thirty years
old.
The injured: Edward Clement, detective
sergeant, three bullet wounds,
serious; Grover Crabtree, policeman,
wounds in wrist and elbow; Mrs. Sadie
Knox, wife of Edward Knox, bullet in
back, serious.
Hundreds of Shots Exchanged.
Hundreds of shots were exchanged
between the crazed slayer and the police
who besieged his fiat in a twostory
brick structure at 32" North
Irving avenue. Three charges of dynamite
were exploded, and an attempt
made to fire the structure with gasoline.
Mclntyre an.] his wife were
armed with powerful rifles. The police
were held at bay for more than an
hour.
Mclntyre's wife is supposed to have
assisted him at least to the extent of
reloading his weapons, as a cartridge
belt was found around her waist similar
to the one worn by her husband.
Her head wa.i blown off by the explosion
of dynamite.
Explanation for Deed.
The explosions blew the rear porch and
part of the kitchen into the alley, and
when the police were able to enter the j
building it was a wreck. They found an j
explanation of Mclntyre's deed in a note
which he left scrawled in lead pencil on
a soiled piece of wrapping paper. "The
Almighty God has made- me a prophet
unto all nations, and also my wife, Hattie
Mclntyre." ran the note.
"You shall know that the Lord has
sent me to gather unto the Lord the
remnant of the Adonic seed."
(At this place in the scrawl the negro
wrote three capital C's and the initials
"P. H")
"The lord has made me the savior of
ail Africans of America and now I shall
recommend all that are worthy unto my
Heavenly Father, the Great God of All
Creation. The Lord has given me a
spirit to judge the quick and the dead.
"I must die in this land that 1 may
V(U i; J*?JF ICJ/UUO IW .-Milllglll.Y UUU
cerning the land of the United States."
In the opinion of the police Mclntyre
wrote the letter just before becoming
violent, although he had opportunity to
do so between lulls while the bluecoats,
having been repulsed, were under cover.
Attracted Attention by Shouts.
The negro first attracted attention
with his shouts about 3:15 o'clock in
the morning, but it was not until 5
o'clock that neighbors, becoming
alarmed, called the police.
Policeman Dean was killed as he
broke down the rear door. Clement
and Crabtree were shot when they entered
to recover Dean's body.
Mrs. Overmeyer was slain when she
went in search of her husband, who had
gone to investigate the shooting. The
crazed r.egro killed Knox as he stepped
on the porch of his home.
Died on Way to Hospital.
Mclntyre, although desperately
wounded after the dynamite had been
exploded, was found leaning against a
' door. He carried a revolver and a
ri nr. neiore ne couia lire, a ouiiet
from a policeman's revolver found its
mark in his head.
He died on the way to a hospital.
The negro had pitched the bodies of
two of his victims out of a window to
the front porch, where they lay in full
view until Melntyre had been killed.

MO LABOR BILL
URGED BYPRESIDENT
Visits Capitol Unheralded,
and Confers With Senator
Kern.
VICE PRESIDENT MARSHALL
AND MARTIN Al SO SFF HIM
Wants Bill Passed Without Delaying
Adjournment?Anxious for Congress
to Get Through Work.
President Wilson paid an unexpected
visit to the Capitol today.
A conference between him and
Senator Kern in the President's
room followed his arrival. The
executive was accompanied only
by two secret service men.
The President's visit was entirely
unheralded ro administration leaders.
When he reached the Capitol building
he w liked to the Senate elevator and
..sked *he con luctor to direct him to the
President's room.
No One to Meet Him.
j There was no one to meet hin.. He
entered it and placed his hat or. the
marble top table. At that moment a
Senate attendant passed the door. The
I'resident called tc him.
"Young: man." sa;.d the President-,
"could you get Senator Kern for ine?"
In a moment the c'erk returned with
the majority leader from Indiana. They
confei red several minutes, after wnich
Sei iiior iJcnin of Virginia and Vice
President Marshall entered the President's
room.
"There is absolutely nothing to get
excited about. ' said Senator Kern, "but
I am not at liberty to discuss the purpose
oi the President's visit."
Urges Child Labor Bill.
It was understood, however, that the
President's visit concerned the legislative
program and the time of adjournment
of Congress,? which the
democrats have tentatively fixed at August
19. The President, it is understood,
urged that the child labor bill
be included in the imperative legislative
program along with the workmen's
compensation bill. The democratic
caucus last week included the
compensation bill, but left the child
labor bill for consideration at the De
! cember session. \
. The President, it is reported, did not
want to delay adjournment, and dis|
russed his plan to have notification of
i his renomination deferred until Coni
gress had completed its labors. He
! sought to bring about an arrangement
i of the legislative program so that the
[ child labor bill could be passed, without
' delaying adjournment, if possible, for
j the reason that it is advisable to begin
! the campaign not later than Septemt
ber 1. and notification cerepionies necj
essarily must be held prior to that time.
Later Senator Kern, while not reveali
ing the details of the conference, said
i that he thought any change of plans
| would not mean any postponement of
i the time for adjournment of Congress,
j Senator Simmons, chairman of the
| finance committee, later joined the
1 President and Senator Martin, the Vice
j President retiring. Senator Reed
i .stopped at the door of the President's
! room for a minute and shook hands
i with the executive, but he did not
j enter.
President Urges His Views.
The Presic^ent was said to have told
several of the conferees that it was
( ssential that the child labor bill pass
at this session of Congress.
One democratic leader in the lobby
outside the President's room suggested !
tha passage of the measure before the '
; corning election would prove helpful in |
attracting the progressive vote to the
| democratic party.
Senator Williams of Mississippi was
sent for by the President later. He
j could not be found immediately and the
j President waited alone for a few mini
utes until the Mississippi senator ar!
rived.
Senators who were anxious to learn
what was going on were informed that j
; the President was insistent that the i
I child labor bill be passed, and that he j
was making an argument to southern I
i senators particularly, who are inclined!
i to hold the measure back, urging them i
| to get into iine for the bill. ;
1 The President left the Capitol after ]
1 an hour's conference without making j
j any detailed statement as to the pur!
pose of his visit. It was generally j
; understood, however, that he discussed :
! little save the child labor bill.

FLOOD LOSS GROWS;
WATERSRECEDING
Nineteen Persons Known to
Have Lost Lives in
Southern States.
GENERAL CONDITIONS
GRADUALLY IMPROVE
Some Railroad Lines Must Be Built
Anew?Many Factories Resume
Operations.
Flood waters throughout the
stricken districts of North Caroj
lina, South Carolina and Tennessee
were receding today, and latest
reports did not increase the
death list of nineteen. The property
loss, however, continues to
grow, and when towns and counties
now cut off from communication
are heard from the first estimates
of from $10,000,000 to |
$15,000,000 damage probably will
be increased.
Railroads apparently have suffered
far more than was at first realized Re
ports rrom western i\ortn ? aromu. are
that some lines there will have t-> be
be almost entirely rebuilt, while
bridges were carried away at many
points in all four states and serious
washouts and landslides occurred
along the roads.
Conditions in Virginias.
Greatly improved conditions are reported
in Virginia and West Virginia.
Streams are falling and normal conditions
are being restored. The New river
valley suffered estimated property loss
of approximately $2,000,000, the Norfolk
and Western railway sustaining about
one-half the damage. Giles
county is said to have been damaged /
to the extent of $2,000,000. Pearsburg i
was entirely inundated.
The Holston and Clinch rivers are
receding after causing damage that
probably will reach a million dollars.
Railroad officials believe it will be
several weeks before normal train
schedules are restored.
Four more deaths were added to the
North Carolina flood toll today. A telephone
message from Brevard was that
John Heath and his mother and Mr3.
Caldwell Santelle and her child died to- I
day from injuries received when 'heir *
homes were caught in a landslide four
miles from Brevard.
Mills Resume Operation.
GREENVILLE, S. C., July 18.?With
recession of the flood waters which
for the last two days have tied up the .
power plants and other public utilities
in this vicinity, cotton mills in the
Piedmont section of South Carolina today
resumed operations. Other industrial
plants also were running today.
Railroad traffic still was badly crip- r
pled. Eighty-three ears of peaches,
valued at thousands of dollars, andconsigned
to northern buyers, are
standing in the railroad yards here.
It is feared they will be a total loss.

'GET TOGETHER"
PLANCOLLAPSES
'rohibitionist Party's Expansion
Defeated by Pro
gressive Move.
10PE LOST OF BALLOTS
OF BULL MOOSE REBELS
inference of Leaders Hears That
Disgruntled Progressives Will
Not Join With Them.
ST. PAUL. Minn., July 18.?
ohn M. Parker's rallying cry to
irogressives for a new national!
onvention of the party in Chi-!
ago August 5, was blamed by J
>rohibition leaders here today for'
he collapse of their plans for a!
>ig '"get together'' conference, at!
vhich they had hoped to enroll:
ts members of their organization
icores of men who have been
>romincnt in the progressive, remblican
and democratic parties.
Instead of a "get together" event, the
Teeting became a prohibition love feast
nd revival service.
The leaders had expected William Al- j
in White and Victor Murdock of Kan-j
as, Judge Albert D. Xortoni of St. j
,ouis and perhaps Col. Parker him- i
elf, to meet with them and pledge j
heir affiliation with the prohibition j
arty. But none of these appeared to- t
a v j
Nortoni Followi Parker.
Judge Nortoni's contribution to the
get together" conference was a teleram
to Virgil G. Hinshaw, national
hairman of the prohibition party, in
,'hich he expressed regret at his inbility
to attend the meeting, but asured
Mr. Hinshaw he "was with him in
pirit."
Judge Norton added that he is
norally bound to support Col. Parker's
andidacy and to assist him in naming i
presidential nominee. He said he ;
i ouid work for the incorporation of a :
rohibrtfon plank in the new progresive
platform, however, and declared
imself unqualifiedly in favor of naional
prohibition
"They are afraid to join us until they
now we intend to go after the votes
mh a ticket every progressive can
upport conscientiously," said Mr. Hinhaw,
referring to the absent progresses.
He indicated an intention to reouble
his efforts to induce the Parker
r>nvolition to indorse the ticket which
he prohibitionists will nominate here
his week.
Foss Is Still ,in Running.
After sending a private telegram to
t. Paul last night in which he declared !
e was not a prohibitionist, politically, j
nd would not accept the nomination for !
resident. Eugene Foss. former Governor j
f Massachusetts, returned to the list of j
otninat ion possibilities today with a teleram
to Mr. Hmshaw in which he said: I
I Jiave thought some one else might bet- |
er make the fight, but if in the judgment |
f the convention I seem to be the only
ne to lead I would give the nomination
very consideration."
Ford Keeps Away.
Henry Ford of Detroit failed to arjve.
early today, although he^ had been
xpected to attend the conference which
iras held today. His absence and silenee
ends color to Motional Chairman Hin
shaw's belief that the Detroit manufacturer
will not permit his name to be
placed before the convention as a presidential
candidate.
Hints of a change in the name of
the party were contained in the address
by which Virgil G. Hincham, chairman
of th<* prohibition national committee
called to order today's conference.
New Party Suggested.
He said in part:
"There is but one party that stands
committed by both state and national
platform declaration to the prohibition*
- C tUft 1 1/111/vv* rT* U ^ ^ ? . .
,\JL llic HMUV1 uaiuv. X lid L pal iy JS ine
prohibition party. Hence there seems
but two alternatives for the hundreds
of thousands who have come to us
either to support the prohibition party
or engage in the formation of a new
party.
"And it is for this conference to decide
what it will do. There are thousands
who believe that the name 'prohibition'
has become so popular in
sound that any other name would not
be so good. There are still others who
believe that some other name could be
chosen that might nearly represent the
multitude who this year will join
hands with us.
"The matter of a mere name, however,
is insignificant. It is important,
however, that we extend the hand of
invitation to the millions of American
voters who this year refuse to bow
the knee to the baal of political unrighteousness,
that we shape a definite
policy and a definite program."

ernment's Views.
BERLIN. Monday, July 17, via London, \
July 18, 2:20 p.m.?The active campaign c
for resumption of submarine warfare in c
its previous form has assumed new im- ^
portance, from an article today by Eugen ?
Zimmerman, general director of the ^
Lokal Anzeiger, whose views, as past r
events have shown, usually reflect the
opinions held in government circles. i
Referring to the reasons which Great *
Britain gave for abandoning the dec- 1
laration of London, Herr Zimmerman t
contemplates the possibility that Great t
Britain will compel smaller neutral states i
to adopt an unfriendly, perhaps a hostile, \
attitude toward the central powers, or
even to close their frontiers completely
against them.
He then cites in heavy type his own r
comment on Germany's acceptance of the
American demands in regard to submarine
warfare, indicating that rlrmm. is
stances might arise lat^r which would 1 a
make it impossible to adhere to the re- t
strictions on the activity of these craft.
Herr Zimmerman goes on to say that c
the political reasons which shaped t
Germany's policy at the time included ! t
the wish to preserve the good will of j
neutrals, and adds:
"But if Great Britain succeeds in ! *
making neutrals passively and actively e
hostile to us, one important reason j s
for Germany's decision at that time!
would cease to exist. It makes no dif- i *
ference whether neutrals yield to Brit- j I
ish orders through sympathy or through | r
fear. ] e
Must Strike New Balance. r
"Even Americans should comprehend v
and appreciate the situation as it
would be changed for the central pow- ]
ers. and the conclusions they of necessity
would draw therefrom. We can I
only strike a balance again of all political
and military factors and choose
what is most useful for Germany, what
best secures German victory." f
Herr Zimmerman then intimates in a r
veiled manner, being unable to discuss
this phase more freely, that the submarine
power of Germany has under- i
gone a favorable change since spring; c
evidently meaning that either their c
numbers or their efficiency have been \
increased considerably. He concludes I
his article with the assertion th^t all
signs indicate that a new decision oxf the ?
.submarine question Will be necessary, r

COURT DISMISSES
CASEMENTAPPEAL
Verdict of Guilty and Sentence
of Death Is Upheld.
PLEA TO HOUSE OF LORDS
POSSIBLE ON CONDITION
Attorney General Must Give Certificate
Indicating Important
Point of Law.
LONDON, July 18.?Without hearing
he attorneys for the crown, the court
)f criminal appeal today dismissed Sir
Roger Casement's appeal from the verlict
of the lower court, which found him
?uilty of treason, for which Viscount
Reading, the lord chief justice senenced
him to death.
For a day and a half Alexander Sulivan,
Sir Roger's counsel, argued be'ore
the court, quoting many authorises
in favor of his contention that the
>ffense of treason depended" upon
vhether the accused dwelt under the
protection of the king-, and that the
:rime could not be committed with>ut
the realm. He abandoned his other
points in regard to the lord chief jusice's
definition of the offense.
Present. During Argument.
As soon as Mr. Sullivan had finished
lis argument the court retired to conlider
whether the attorneys for the
rown would be called on to reply. It
loon decided to the contrary, which inlicated
that the appeal had gone
igainst Sir Roger, who was present
luring the argument and when judgnent
was given.
A further appeal to the house of lords
s possible only if the attorney general
fives a certificate that the decision of
he court of criminal appeal involves a
>oint of law so exceptionally important
hat it is desirable in the public interest
hat a still higher court should deal with
t. This has been done only twice since
he court of criminal appeal was estabished
eight years ago.
Arguments Praised.
Justice Darling in delivering the judg- i
nent expressed the indebtedness of the j
;ourt to Mr. Sullivan for his well conlidered
and well delivered arguments,
idding that they were worthy of the best
raditions of the king's courts, but he de
lared that tney naa Deen answered by i
he attorneys of the crown at the first
rial.
Attorney Michael Francis Doyle of
Philadelphia, of counsel for Sir Roger,
xpressed the opinion today that it was j
mprobable the attorney would certify
he case for appeal to the house of
ords, as the court did not consider it
lecessary to hear argument for the govirnment.
Powerful influences are working for a
eprieve, said the attorney, and there
vere strong hopes of one being granted, j
