CHINESE PRESENT
GRAVE PROBLEM
NUMEROUS 0RIENTAL8 FOLLOW
THE 60LDIERS IN MEXICO TO
8ELL SUPPLIES.
Field headquarters In Mexico, July
12.—By motor truck to Columbus, N.
M.—What to do with the three hun
dred Chinese who have associated
themselves with the punitive expedi
tio has developed into a serious prob
lem with the army since shortening of
the American line in Mexico recently
revealed the large number enjoying
present security under the protection
of the American flag.
These Chinese flocked to the Ameri
can lines to make money while the
Mexicans through pride refused to sell
hungry soldiers anything to eat, or
through poverty were unable to traf
fic with the American troops. The
Chinese stepped in and succeeded.
Many a soldier without soap secured
his first good wash by buying a cake
from a Chinaman.
In the desert wherever a truck train
was likely to stop for water there was
a Chinaman. Doughnuts, candy, to
bacco, matches and fruit, which com
prised about all the luxuries known to
the men during this oampaign, were
furnished by Chinese and by them
only. Chinese from points as far dis
tant as Chihuahua became the shop
keepers of the army, traveling in two
horse wagons with a dozen persons to
one vehicle.
Like the Mexicans who were threat
ened for having business dealings with
the army, these Chinese lay them
selves open to reprisals after the de
parture of the troops. Consequently
they have followed the army north*
ward toward the border.
REACH THE WEST
FRESH CONTINGENT OF THE
CZAR'S 80LDIERS JOIN THEIR
ALLIE8 IN FRANCE.
Paris, July 17.—A contingent of Rus
sian troops disembarked today at
Brest, France.
The Russian troops will be sent to
camp from Brest* and later to the
front.
This is the sixth contingent of Rus
sian troops, the arrival of which in
France has been reported. Between
April 20 and May 5 there arrived at
Marseilles five bodies of Russian sol
diers, after a land and sea Journey of
about 17,500 miles, from Moscow,
where they were assembled, to Port
Dalny, Manchuria, and thence by wat
er via the Sues canal. The first five
oontlngents are believed to number
about 25,000 men. These troop* were
quartered at Camp de Mailly, near
Troyes, for several weeks and then
sent to the front. The official French
communication of last night showed
that Russian troops were in the
trenches in the Champagne.
It was said that the sending of the
first contingents was largely an ex
periment and that they might be fol
lowed by more substantial numbers.
On the former occasion the Russians
arrived without arms, whieh were sup
plied by the French. The explanation
was given that it was easier to send
men out of Russia's surplus to the
western front than to forward arms
and ammunition to the east
WIRELESS PHONE
USES THE GROUND
San Francisco, July 17.—Dr. H. Bar
rlnger Cox, an inventor, announced to
day he had perfected a subterranean
wireless telephone and that, incidental
ly, he had discovered a new law of
physics—that electrical energy can be
transmitted over a single conductor.
For the last five months Dr. Cox has
been working at Los Olives, Cal., with
the U. S. forest service to perfect a
system of wireless signals for forest
fires. It was while so engaged, he said,
that he discovered the possibilities of
transmitting the human voice through
the ground.
The equipment consists of an ordi
nary telephone transmitter connected
with a battery and a special instru
ment—Dr. Cox's secret—with a ground
wire. At the receiving station, five or
fifty miles away, is a similar equip
ment. The only connection between
the two stations is the ground through
which travels the current carrying the
voloe impulses.
HUNTING SEA TREASURE.
New York, July 17.—A deep sea
treasure hunting expedition financed
by wealthy New York men arrived to
day off the Virginia capes. Its first
operations will be conducted at the
grave of the Ward line steamship Mer
idia, which went to the bottom four
years ago carrying silver bars and oth
er treasure valued at more than
$1,000,000. The expedition is under
command of George D. Stillson, who
raised the submarine F-4 in Honolulu
harbor last year.

State Organizations That
Are Not Well Equipped
to Stay in Camps
PLENTY OF MEN AT
BORDER OF MEXICO
Soldiers in Texas Being
Put Through Drills to
Prepare for War
Washington, D. C., July 17. —Addi
tional national guard organizations will
be dispatched to the Mexican border
only after they have been organized
and equipped thoroughly. Department
commanders were delaying transporta
tion of Incomplete units today on in
structions from the war department.
About 25,000 men now in mobiliza
tion camps are affected by the new or
ders, which revoke a ruling that waiv
ed certain requirements made when
the Mexican situation appeared acute.
Some 100,000 guardsmen are on the
border now. These, with 50,000 reg
ulars and 5,000 reserves, comprise a
force sufficient, officials believe, to
make unnecessary the sending of more
Inadequately equipped state troops.
VILLA SURROUNDED.
El Paso, Tex., July 17.—Gen. Gab
riel Gavira, former commander of the
government forces in northern Chi
huahua, has left Mexico City for the
border and will assume his old com
mand at Juarez at the end of the week,
Lieut. Col. Leon Buclon, acting com
mander of the garrison, announced to
day. Gen. Gavira will relieve Gen.
Francisco Gonzales, who probably will
be assigned in charge of the Mexican
field base at Villa Ahumada, eighty
three miles south of El Paso.
Col. Buclon said that Villa is sur
rounded in the bottoms of the Florido
river by the de facto troops.
HAVE 8HAM INVASION.
San Antonio, Tex., July 17.—Illinois
troops, like the others mobilized at
Camp Wilson, indulged in a hypothet
ical invasion of Mexico today. It was
all a sham except the weather, which
was hot enough for the real thing.
In the working out of the tactical
problems involved, some of the mini
crossed at Laredo, some at Browns
ville, some at El Paso and others
landed at Vera Cruz.
The Illinois field artillery is being
hammered into shape but It will take
three weeks more to make a regiment
of it, it is said. Battery is boasting
a new vehicular field kitchen which
has everything from an Ice box to
twenty-five gallon thermos bottles. It
can feed 250 men at once.
SETTLEMENT NOT MADE.
Washington, D. C., July 17.—No
agreement has been reached as yet in
the preliminary conferences between
Acting Secretary Polk of the state de
partment and Eliseo Arredondo, Mex
ican ambassador designate, for settle
ment of border difficulties. Mr. Polk
authorized this statement today.
It was indicated that the purpose of
the informal conversations was only
to outline the procedure to be followed
in later negotiations.
A Joint commission, composed of
diplomatic, military and commercial
representatives of each government, is
expected to be the plan adopted, the
preliminary conferences also to estab
lish the specific questions to be debat
ed by the commission.
Special Agent Rodgers at Mexico
City today advised the state depart
ment that he had obtained from the
de facto government an extension until
September 1 of the time in which min
ing taxes for the present period of
three months might be paid.
NOT 10 GUARD VESSEL
United 8tates Assume* That British
Warships Will Not Invade Three
Mile Limits.
Washington, D. C., July 17.—There
will be no patrol of American war
ships off the Virginia coast to see that
allied cruisers awaiting the reappear
ance of the German merchant subma
rine Deutschl&nd stay outside the
three mile limit. Secretary Daniels
said today that the United States as
sumed that its territorial waters would
not be violated by the allied men of
war and had no fear that the subma
rine would be attacked before she
reached the high seas.
So far as can be learned, the Wash
ington government has not been noti
fied of the Deutschland's probable
sailing but it is believed that she will
drop down from Baltimore to some cove
in the Chesapeake bay and from there
slip to sea on the first favorable dark
night.
Baltimore, Md., July 17.—After to
morrow no more vlsitore will be al
lowed on board the Deutschland. This
announcement today was taken as an
indication that the underwater liner
will leave Baltimore before the middle
of the week. Stevedores resumed
work of putting rubber and nickel into
the hold of the submarine early to
day.

ORPET ESCAPES
OTTUMWA COURIER, TUESDAY, JULY 18, 1916
AFTER ACQUITTAL
GOE8 AUTO RIDINQ WITH HIS
BROTHER AND LITTLE MORE
IS HEARD OP HIM.
Chicago, July 17.—Will H. Orpet, ac
quitted of the murder of Marlon Lam
bert by a Lake county Jury at Wauko
gan Saturday night, spent yesterday,
his first day of freedom since Febru
ary 11, far away from the crowds.
The young collegian arose about 6
o'clock yesterday morning and short
ly afterward, accompanied by his
mother and brother, Ed, went for a
long automobile ride in the oountry
about Lake Forest.
Reports that he went in the direc
tion of River Forest, where Miss Ce
lestia Youker resides, and that he saw
the girl during the day could not be
verified. Edward O. Orpet, the father,
who remained at the home on the Mc
Cormick estate, refused to disclose
the whereabouts of Will and would
neither affirm nor deny the reports re
garding Miss Youker.
One Man Dissents.
It required five hours for the Jury
to reach a unanimous verdict. One
man held out all that time, for from
the first eleven of the twelve Jurors
believed Orpet Innocent of the crime
charged.
Orpet was In his cell at 7 o'clock
Satufday evening when the flash came
that a verdict had been reached. Court
was immediately convened and the
acquittal verdict was read.
Orpet was silent through excess of
emotions. He was barely able to re
turn the handclasps of his attorneys.
He made his way to the Jurors and
shook their hands one by one, smil
ing wanly but saying nothing.
Mrs. Orpet did not lose her self-pos
session for a second. She received the
verdict as if it were a mere matter of
routine. She noted that a photogra
pher was trying to snap a picture of
her son and herself and she warned
him, meanwhile shielding her own
face with a newspaper.
James H. Wilkerson, chief of coun
sel for the defense, was unable to
keep back the tears and they trickled
~ffom Ills eyes when he, with his asso
ciates, Ralph F. Potter and Leslie P.
Hanna, were receiving congratula*
tlons.
Attorneys Pleased.
"Orpet was more than declared not
guilty. He was proven. innocent,"
said Mr. Wilkerson. "He is going
home with his mother now. Then he
is going into the country for a much
needed rest after the nerve racking
experience brought on him by a re
markable, if not unprecedented, series
of circumstances. Then he will come
back home and make a man of him
self."
RURAL CREDITS
BILL IS SICNED
Washington, D. C., July 17.—Presi
dent Wilson today signed the rural
credits bill, passed recently by con
gress. A group of senators, represen
tatives and officers of farmers' organ
izations applauded warmly as Mr. Wil
son affixed his signature. The meas
ure creates a system of twelve land
loan banks under direction of a feder
al board.
"I can not go through the simple
ceremony of signing this bill without
expressing the feeling that I have in
signing It," said the president. "It is
a feeling of profound satisfaction not
only, but of real gratitude that we
have completed this piece of legisla
tion, which I hope will be Immensely
beneficial to the farmers of the coun
try.
"The farmers, it seems to me, have
occupied hitherto a singular position
of disadvantage. They have not had
the same freedom to get credit on
their real estate that others have had
who were in manufacturing and com
mercial enterprises and while they
have sustained our life they did not
in the same degree with some others
share in the benefits of that life.
"Therefore, this bill along with the
very liberal provisions of the federal
reserve actB put them upon an equal
ity with all others who have genuine
the Fanners' Educational Cooperative
the country available to them. One
can not but feel that this is delayed
Justice to them. I look forward to the
benefits of this bill, not with extrava
gant expectations but with confident
expectation that it will be of very
wide reaching benefits and incidental
ly it will be of advantage to the in
vesting community for I can imagine
no more satslfactory and solid invest
ments than this system will afford
those who have money to use."
The president used two pens in
singing the bill and gave one to Sena
tor Fletcher of Florida.
In addition to the number of mem
bers of the house and Benate, the sign
ing was witnessed by David Lubin, one
of the originators of the bill, and rep
resentatives ofHhe National grange,
the Farmers' Educational Coperative
union, the Farmers' Society of Equity,
the Ancient Order of Gleaners, the
Farmers' National /congress and the
National Council of Farmers' Cooper
ative associations.

CAUSE OF DEATH
Hedrick Man Dies in Agony
at Local Hotel at Early
Hour This Morning
MAKES STATEMENT
JUST BEFORE DYING
Said Man Near Depot Gave
Him Bottle of Beer Does
Not Mention Name
The coroner finished his post
mortem examination of Young's
body this afternoon at 3 o'clock.
No report is being made at this
time and further Investigation into
the cause of the man's death will
be made by state university hos
pital authorities at Iowa City.
James Arthur Young, aged 24 years
and living near Hedrick died at 2:50
o'clock this morning in a room at the
McElroy hotel on South Market street
Young is believed, by the attending
physician, to have died from a poison
and according to his brief ante mortem
statement it was given him in a bottle
of beer by a man near a railroad depot
a short time before. An inquest and
post mortem are being held at the Dag
gett undertaking parlors this after
noon.
About 1 o'clock Young engaged a
room at the McElroy from Night Clerk
Moran and after ordering some water
melon retired to the room on the sec
ond floor. About 2:40 o'clock Officer
Al Llghtner heard someone screaming
as he passed through the alley between
Main and Second streets along side the
hotel. He made an investigation and
found that the noise was coming from
one of the rear rooms on the second
floor of the building. lie went into the
office and found that the screams had
attracted the night' help at. the hotel
and a physician had been called. Upon
doing to the room the officer found
Sergeant Alex Johnson of the United
States recruiting office with the man.
Came To Assist.
Sergeant Johnson lives Just above
the room In which Young was 111, and
aroused by the man's screams and
groans, had gone to his assistance.
When he entered Young was having
one convulsion after another and was
suffering so much that he was not able
to talk. The officer worked with him
In an effort to produce relief but it was
only temporary.
He told Sergeant Johnson his name
and address and said that a fellow near
the depot had given him a bottle of
beer and had told him that he would
get even with him. Johnson tried time
and time again to get Young to tell
him who had given him the beer or
which depot he was talking about but
as soon as he had muttered a few
words he would have another convul
sion and scream for help.
By the time the physician and Offi
cer Llghtner arrived Young was hav
ing his last spasm. He lapsed into un
consciousness and died almost imme
diately.
Find Bottle in Alley.
This morning the army officer found
a small vial lying In the alley at the
rear of the hotel. It could have fallen
In Its place by being thrown at an
angle from Young's room. The bottle
was turned over to the coroner by the
sergeant. Whether the man drank
poison after he went to the room and
threw the bottle out of the window or
whether he was given it by another
person are the questions which con
front the officers. No signs of any
poison having been in the room were
seen.

RISING WATER BRINGS DISASTER:
NINE DROWNED AND MUCH
DAMAGE IS DONE.
Raleigh, N. C., July 17. —Flood wat
ers which swept parts of North Caro
lina, South Carolina, Virginia, Tennes
see and West Virginia, taking a toll of
at least nine lives, rendering hundreds
of persons homeless and doing proper
ty damage variously estimated at from
$10,000,000 to $15,000,000, were reoed
ing today.
The worst conditions obtained In
western North Carolina where the
flood was described as the most dis
astrous in the history of that section.
Asheville and its environs were the
heaviest sufferers but with train and
telegraph service badly crippled, it
probably will be several days before
the full extent of death and destruc

Lower Asheville still was flooded to
day by the waters of the French Broad
river, which yesterday swept away
mills and other manufacturing plants
and a number of homes. Two deaths
were reported in the city proper. An
other death oocurred at Biltmore, to
the east, and two score persons, inplud
