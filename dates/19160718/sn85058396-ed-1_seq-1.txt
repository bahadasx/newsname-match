Petrograd, July 1 8, via London, 7: 1 2 p. m. A Russian
i victory over Teutonic forces in southern Volhynia has resulted
in their being driven across the river Lipa and beyond that
stream, says a war office statement issued today. Indications
I aye, the statement adds, that the retreat was effected in great
- disorder.
The official statement says:
"In the Riga region there was an artillery duel. The Ger-
l mans at many places attempted unsuccessfully to recapture
lost trenches.
"As the result of the latest skilful operations of General
'i Sakaroff s troops in Volhynia we gained a victory on July 1 6
which brought us 13,000 prisoners and 30 guns, as announced
; yesterday, and enabled us to sweep the enemy completely
from the left bank of the lower Lipa. driving him to Krassoff
j and beyond the river. Judging by the abundance of war ma-
terial the enemy abandoned, he retreated in great disorder.
A Some of the 1 7-inch guns captured here yesterday are already
I bombarding positions on the south bank of the Lipa."
Rome, July 18, via London, 2:45 p. m. The Italians
are making advances despite vigorous offensives, the war of-
fice announced today.
Paris, July 1 8, 4 : 35 p. m. Official advices received from
V Saloniki under date of Monday say that cannonading is in pro-
J gress along the entire Saloniki front.
"Allied aeroplanes burned part of the Bulgarian
i crops in the region of Monastir" the statement says. "There
L is cannonading along the whole front."
The information given -out in regard to the situation at
3 Saloniki is not sufficiently explicit to indicate whether the en-
- tente allies are preparing an offensive movement. A drive
j from the Saloniki front has been predicted for some time. It
I is generally understood the allies have 600,000 or more men
available on this front for a campaign.

were fired and the police were held
at bay more than an hour. In all the
halucination of the negro that he
must "carry a report to Almighty God"
cost six lives.
The negro, H. J. Mclntyre, armed
with a rifle, barricaded himself in his
flat in a two story brick structure on
the west side. The police unable to
make headway againstthe rapid and
accurate fire of the demented man
made an ineffectual attempt to burn
the place, then exploded three char
ges of dynamite under It,
Blew Off Rear Porch.
The explosion blew the rear porch
and part of the kitchen Into the alley
and when the police were able to
enter the building it was a wreck.
They found an explanation of Mcln
ivre's deed in a note which he left
scrawled in lead pencil on a soiled
piece of brown wrapping paper.
"The Almighty God has made me a
prophet unTo"all nations and also my
wife, Hattie Mclntyre" ran the note.

The negro is believed to have writ
ten his letter just before the fit of vio
lent insanity seized him.
Hundred Police In Siege.
More than a hundred policemen took
part in the siege of Mclntyre's strong
hold Tho negro first attracted the
attention of neighbors by shouting
about 3 o'clock in tho morning. He
grew more violent toward five o clock
and alarmed neighbors camo out to
'investigate. The nego began to
shoot and calls Immediately were sent
Prank Freimuth, one of Uie police
men, ,told this story:
"Stuart Dean was shot when he en
tered tho building after breaking down
a rear door. I and four other police
men were with him but he s;t.be
first to enter. He was shot and Killed
the instant that ho crossed the thrcsii
old. Clement and Crabtree were snot
down when they entered to recover
Dean's body. Both tell and we had to
go In and get the three of them.
"The crazv negro was barncadeu
behind a trunk and other articles
when we came in. He had a rifle and
a revolver when we came in and nreu
so fast that I couldn't count them.
Neighbors Awakened By Shots.
Mrs. Knox gave this version
"I was tawakened about 'five o clock
by shouts and screams," she said. I
awakened my husband and we found
that the screams came from a woman
at Mclntyre's home. We went out on
our porch. A bullet struck my bus
band and ho fell dead. I started back
into. tho house to warn my niece. A
bullet got mo in tho back."
Mrs. Knox told her story from a cot
in the hospital whero it was said her
condition was 3erious. She said thai
neighbors for some months had con
sidered Mclntyro queer and did not
associate with him. His actions at
.times became so strange Unit. the po-
, f
lice were called, but his offenses were
not considered erious enough to war
rant arrest.
Wife Reloads Weapons.
Mclntyre's wife is supposed to have
assisted him by reloading his weap
ons. A cartridge belt was Tound
around her waist similar to the one
worn by her husband. The negro fired
wi.th deliberation, almost as though at
target practice.
After the neighbors became arous
ed it was not long until squads of po
lice flocked to the scene, headed by
Chief Healy himself. It was 8
o'clock, however, three hours after the
firing of the first shot before the trag
edy ended with the death of its in
stigators. Fusilade of Shots.
Tho first detail of 12 policemen un
der Lieutenant Leslie West Brook at
tempted to storm the house with clubs
and pistols but were driven back.
Rifles were brought up. The blue
coats poured a fusilade Into every
window. For a time the negro ceased
to fire and it was thought he was
dead. When a policeman tried the
door he reopened fire going from
window to window and "firing with
calm precision.
The bluecoats were chary of Mcln
tyre's marksmanship but by this time
authority was obtained to fire the
building. It was so hazardous an un
dertaking, however, that only a small
blaze was started among the shing
les and this died out of itself.
Policeman Dean Killed.
Policeman Dean was killed as he
broke down the rear door oT the Mc
lntyre house. Clement and Crabtree
was shot when they entered to recov
er Dean's body. Mrs. Overmyer was
slain when she went in search of her
husband who had gone to investigate
the shooting.
Dynamite finally was brought and
exploded, wrecking the house. Mrs.
Mclntyre's head was blown off and
her body riddled with bullets. She
was found thus, but Mclntyre, al
though wounded, was leaning against
a bedroom door leading from the kitch
en. Before he could fire, a bullet
from one of the officers found its
mark in his head. He was taken to a
hospital where he died.
F,!rst Shot Fired.
The first shot is said to have-been
fired by Mrs. Mclntyre at Mrs. Wil
liam Bedford, a negro who was feed
ing chickens in the rear of her home
next door to the Mclntyres. Mrs. Mc
lntyre used a rifle. Bedford, who is
white, came out with a revolver but
was driven in. Neither he nor his
wife was wounded.
Mrs. Overmyer was the next fired
at. Mclntyre then went to the front
of the house where he saw Knox and
killed him. The next bullet reached
Mrs. Knox. Matthews living in the
same building, met death next. The
shooting had been done from the out-
tho Vinnan. Vnt until the first
of the police appeared did the negroes
barricade themselves inside. .
The police raked the flat fore and
aft one squad firing from the alley;
another from the street.
When the stronghold was taken aft
er the explosion of the dynamite the
police found the walls of the house
decorated, with, magazine pictures,
some portraying General Villa and
scenes along the Mexican border. An
open Bible lay on a table.

SUBMARINE WAR
MAY BE RENEWED
Berlin, July 17, via London, July 18.
2:30 p. m. The active campaign for
resumption of submarine warfare in
Its previous form has assumed new
importance from an article today by
Eugene Zimmerman, general director
of the Lokal Anzelger, whose views
as past events have shown, usually
reflect the opinions held in govern
mental circles.
Referring to the reasons which
Great Britain gave for abandoning
the Declaration of London, Herr Zim
mermann contemplates the possibili
ty that Great Britain will compel
smaller neutral states to adopt an un
friendly, perhaps a hostile, attitude
towards the central powers, or even
to close their frontiers completely.
He then cites, In heavy type, his
own comment on Germany's accept
ance of the American demands in re
gard to submarine warfare, indicating
that circumstances might arise later
which would make It impossible to ad
here to the restrictions upon the ac
tivity of these craft.
Herr Zimmerman goes on to say
that the political reasons which shap
ed Germany's policy at the time in
cluded the wish to preserve the good
will of neutrals and adds:
"But, If Groat Britain succeeds In
making neutrals passively or active
ly hostile to us, one important rea
son for Germany's decision at that
time would cense to exist. It-makes
no difference whether neutrals yield
to British orders through sympathy
or through fear."
Herr Zimmerman intimates in a
veiled manner being unablo to dis
cuss this phase more freely, that the
submarine power of Germany has
undergone a favorable change since
spring, evidently meaning that either
their numbers or their efficiency have
been increased considerably.
