MlssfPeggy Ilyland, the beautiful
andftnlcntcd llttlo English actross,
v.hoso recet arrival In America to ap
pear exclusively on the screen under
this management of the famous Play
ers Film Co., has created consider
nble newspaper comment, makes her
debut to the American public in a
thrilling plcturlzatlon of Henry Arth
ur Jones' noted dramatic succes3,
"Saints and Sinners." This current
releaso on tho Paramount Program
will bo shown at the Lyric Theater
beginning Wednesday and Thursday,
July 19 and 20.
It Is a matter of odd Interest that
Miss Ilyland, who has distinguished
herself abroad In the stellar roles of
many stage successes, should appear
In her first American screen offering
In an Englishman's play and a drama
moreover, that won its first success
In Europe.rcpeatlng its stago triumph
later in tho United States.
Miss Hyland in tho leading role of
Letty Fletcher, tho only daughter of
tho Minister of Stcopleford, wont with
a selected cast of Famous Players,
headed by Director Jas. Kirkwood,
to tho most beautiful sections ot
' Florida for the purpose of filming this
suporb drama.
When the story opens, Letty Is a
contented llttlo village maid living
-with her father and Lydla, their houso
keeper. She la tho life ot the little
family, and by her Innocent pranks
keeps the two old folks young. Oeorce
Klngsmlll, a farmer is vainly calling
on Letty for her hand in marriage, to
the regret of her father the minister.
Letty, like most country girls, has a
desire to see the city, and ia attracted
, to Captain Fanshawe, a gentleman
,ilv.s 0f worldly experience and question-
-TZY"? able reputation. Tho Iter. Fletcb-'ir
IM ' and George finally persuade her to
A rofraln from meeting the Interloper
again.
I Samuel Hoggnrd, a wealthy banker
' and deacon of tho Stcepleford church
holds tho Itev. Fletcher's only invest
ment and livelihood in his hands.
Chagrined at tho .minister's deliber
ate refusal ot his crooked demands,
Hoggard swears vengeance.
At tho annual church picnic, Fan
shaw again apenrs and invites Letty
to accompany him for a row on th-a
river, as ho intends to leave tho town
forever. It becomes very late; Fan
sbawo offers to tako her homo by
train, which she also consents to.
However, the Captain secures tickets
for Now York, not for Stcepleford.
Letty realizes her predicament too
late, she Is already on her way. Hog
gard observes thecouple and forms Ms
cwn opinions.
Immediately upon her arrival, Letty
confesses all In a lotter to her father
Tho Minister and tho enraged George
leavo for tho city to tho aid ot tho un-
fortunato girl. Raddles, a relative of
Fanshawo's calls at Letty's room to
tell her of tho Captain's double llfo,
upsetting all her hopes of redeeming
herself. Fortunately she is rescued
by hor father and" tho young farmer.
Through tho treachery of Hoggard,
to tholr only witness, the Minister loses
to his position nt tho church. George,
to rafter a Journey to tho West, return
with a fortune and marries Lotiy.
to Happiness again reigns supremo when
to the congregation reinstates their be-
to loved preacher.

CONG. JOSEPH HOWELL
. ..i i - 2.
JOSEPH HOWELL HAS
ANNOUNCED HIMSELF
FOR RE-ELECTION
h-
Asks Renomination ream First District
Republicans on His Record in Wash
ington and Devotion to Republican
Principles.
Congressman Joseph Howell has an
nounced that ho will be a candidate
for renomination and reelection uu
the Republican ticket from tho First
congressional district of Utah and de
clare that lie will make the race on
the platform of the Republican na
tional convention and his record In
Congress. His services In Congress,
together with his wide acquaintance
among leading Republicans and pub
lic men of tho nation have Impressed
his friends, who have urged him to
stand for reelection.
In announcing his candidacy Con
gressman Howell paid a high tribute
to Charles E. Hughes the Republic
an nominee for President, lauded
tho manner In which the Republican
and Progressive parties have been
reunited, and condemned tho Demo
cratic administration not only for its
foreign policy, but for tho sectional
, Ism which ho declares is provolent
nt Washington and for Its extrava
gant national expenditures, which
havo necessitated tho passago In the
House of a bill which he characteriz
es as being the most vicious class
loclslatlon over originating In Con-
gress. (
Congressman Howell further de
clares that tho movement of tho ad
ministration to Incorporate Into pro
posed legislation planks from tho Re
publican platform is anothor evldenco
of tho wcaknoss ot the Wilson ad-
ministration.
From tho time. that Imposing 06
uro, Charles Evan Hughes, appeared '
upon tho political horizon tho people
havo looked to him for deliverance
from tho conditions which prevail in
this country," said Congressman How
ell. From tho moment his messago
accepting his party's call was flashed
over tho country ho has continually1
giown In strength nnd popularity
among Uio American people Ho has
grasped the hands ot tho discordant
elements In tho Republican party
and united them In the handclaps ot
an oamest resolvo and determination
to restore Republicanism throughout
tho land.
Cannot Be Misled
''Republicans and Progressives aro
now together llko reconciled brothors,
mutually regretful for past differenc
es aud united In determination to ac
complish a triumphant victory In tho
nation. In somo cases the Progres
sives litre still being used as a decoy
In tho Interest of tho Democratic par
ty but this deception will not mislead
the truo Progressive citizen of this
country.
A Wasteful Congress
"The present session of Congress
will be long remembered as tho most
wanton, wasteful and extravagant as
regards expenditures that has ever
been privileged to sit In Washington.
The total appropriations will reach
$1,700,000,000 or moro than 70 por
cent greater than tho billion dollar
Congress under Republican rule.
Swarms of new offices havo been
created. From 30,000 to 40,000 now
ofllco holders havo been given Jobs
under tho Democratic administration
and tho greater part of thoso havo
been appointed without regard to tho
clll service law, which Is In force,
although President Wilson proffered
humblo dovbtlon to the civil sorvlce
policy. Theso lavish expenditures
have been niado In splto of tho hy
pocritical and stereotyped declaration
of the Democratic platform for rigid
economy.
Vicious Revenue Policy
"Tho Democratic party Is raising
rcvenuo by a vicious and unusual as
sault upon tho protective tariff pol
icy and discloses a determination on
tho pnrt ot the administration to re
sort to direct internal taxation ra
ther than collect tho expenses noces
sary for Improvements nnd a great
er army and navy through a tariff,
which under Republican rulo has rJ
ays. been tho moans of collecting
money without placing tho burden on
the peoplo.
It has beon frequently said that
tho south is In tho saddlo ond that
southern statesmen aro making hay
while the Bun shines. Thoy havo
boon revelling In tho prospect of big
sums through oppressive taxation on
tho northern and western stateB to
spond on useless river and harbor
Improvements, nitrate plants and oth
er prospects in southern states. Many
measures ponding In tho Sonata are
slnlstor and far reaching and not for
tho best Interests of tho nation, but

INDEPENDENT
SOGAR FACTORY

J5C.000 Paid On Contract. Farmers
to Share In Profits of New
Company
That an Independent Sugar Factory
for Cache Valley Is fast becoming a
reality .seems evident from tho fact
that J. A. Hcndrlckson, who has been
working on this project for somo
tlmo, says ho has signed a contract
for a sugar mill with the Dyer Con
struction Company nnd forwarded
tho first payment of 50,000 Judging
from tho fact that money talks, tho
people of Wost Cacho can now con
gratulate themsolvos that the long
desired sugar factory Is apparently
but a tow months away. In speaking
of tho now factory, Mr. Hondrlckson
said: "Tho matter has now beon un
der consideration since tho tatter
part of Fobruary when prominent
farmers of West Cacho roquestod my
asslstanco in tho way of securing u
factory for that locality. Efforts
wore put forth for securing sufficient
acreago to Justify tho building of
the factory and when this was
cured money matters wore arranged
nnd a contract with the Dyer Com
pany wob entered "into for tho con
struction of tho mill, The Amalgam
ated Sugar Company soon nftor "P;
posed the oroctlon of an independent
factory stating that they would, build
tho factory out of their surplus and
thero wns no roason why tho farmers
should want stock In tho company.
Prior to this tlmo, n groat many ot
tho farmers had asked the privilege
of becoming stockholders nnd had
rubscrlbed, to the Independent Com
pany Last week the Amalgamated
Company, through Its President re
