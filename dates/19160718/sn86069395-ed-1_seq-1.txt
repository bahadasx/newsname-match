DM
SAYS
fiROWFRUIT
Horticulturist Elliott Advises
New Kind of Farming
For County.
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
North Christian Suited For
Orchards; Hopkinsville
Shipping Point.
"Grow Fruit" was the advice giv
en Christian county farmers, especial
ly those of North Christian, by N. R.
Elliott, horticulture expert sent here
by the extension department of the
Agricultural Experiment Station of
the state.
After visiting the farms of the
northern part of the county, Mr. El
liott was enthusiastic in urging the
growing of fruit in this section. He
said that with Hopkinsville as a ship
ping place on a freight line with Chi
cago and St. Louis, there should be
no difficulty in selling small fruits and
truck vegetables. The demand for
these, he said, is always greater than
the supply and this should make the
raising of small fruits and vegetables
a exeat source of income to the
county.
The land in North Christian, he
said, would make excellent orchard
land and he strongly urged the farm
ers and Agriculturist A. M. Casey, to
inaugurate a fruit growing movement
for the county.
In his report to the Experiment
Station, Mr. Elliott said Jliat the land
here vvas excellent for fruits and veg
etables but lacked development along
that line. Prof. Elliott said before
leaving tfiht during the latter partuf
the summer he would return to this
county .and co-operate with County
AgriculiuristCasey in organizing fruit
growing clubs. He will also give ad
vice in regard to the planting ;and
care of the fruit.
Mr. Elliott says that the only way a
success can be made of fruit growing
is for the growers to co-operate and
make their purchases and sales to
gether through the county agent.
This makes the fruits uniform and
greatly aids in marketing. It also en
ables ihe farmers to get much better
prices by co-operative buying and
selling.
Thefarmers of the northern section
o? thecounty seem del!hted roriih the
prospect of making fruit growing the
big faiture of their work and are en
tering enthusiastically into the .move
ment. NATIVE OF

EVERYBODY
FOR FOSTER
Colored Teachers Want His
Office Kept Out
Of Politics.
THE NON-PARTISAN IDEA.
Resolutions Adopted By The
Colored Teachers Of
The County.
L. E. FOSTER.
The Christian county colored teach
ers institute which has just completed
its annual session at the Second street
school building, passed a strong
resolution endorsing the administra
tion of Prof. L. E. Foster, Democratic
county superintendent of schools, and
called upon both the Democratic and
Republican parties not to put out any
opposition against him for re-election
next year, basing this on ihe grounds
that he could then give all his time
and enereies to the welfare of the
schools rather than to prosecuting
campaign for re-election..
The meeting held was. full of inter
est and was considered the most
beneficial ever liad by the above.
teachers of the county. The resolu
tion about Prof. Fester follows.
"Whereas, We, the colored teach
ers of Christian county, realizing that
all true reforms must come -from the
people ami knowing that ihe public
school is that institution upon whieh
most of the great responsibility rests,
feel it to be our duty to foster and
encourage such measures and support
such officers as will make ihe school
a potent factor whereby this end may
be obtained.
We believeithat the office of Coun
ty Superintendent, representing as it
does the educational interest of the
boys and girls, of all the people ir
respective of race, color or party af
filiation, should be taken out of
politics that the superintendent might
be left free to devote his .entire time
and energies to the work of said
office.
Since our present County Superin
tendent, Prof. L. E". Foster, has been
a : .. : i cc ... i.. j. iu .
I tentionof the.peoplo to the schools in
a manner which has caused all scc-
I tions of theoounty to lookwith deepe
. interest and greater concern upon
this all absorbing question, and
j whereas, to .continue this office in
politics would necessarily take the
superintendent away from the duties
of his office to meet the various issues
incident to a. campaign of that kind,
resulting as it would in a loss to the
children and to the county- thus
seriously regarding the progress of
that school spirit of which he has been
tho instrument of creating, therefore.
Bo it resolyed that wo most earnest
ly request . the Democratic and Re
publican parties that they place no
candidate in tho field in opposition to
him.

HAS
ARRIVED
Concensus of Opinion is That
1916 Will Differ From
1816.
THE SUMMERLESS YEAR
!ven "Uncle Dick" Holland
Seeks the Shady Side
of the Street.
History tells us that in 1816 there
was no summer and even in Jury
there was ice and snow. This sum
mer is not to be a repetition of that
of 100 years ago.
The concensus of opinion is that we
are already having some weather that
may be fairly classed as summer heat.
Sunday the mercury was well above
90 and yesterday it tried to work a
little harder than it did on Sunday.
Close observers report that "Uncle
Dick" Holland, who is a sort of ba
rometer, so to speak, did not sit in the
sun at any time yesterday afternoon
When the weather approaches sum
mer heat he forsakes his own side of
the street and moves his chair to the
west side, in the shade of a big bill
board and spends his afternoons fan
ning himself with a palm leaf fan
Col. Holland moved over yesterday,
wnicn is a sure sien mat summer is
coming.
Several well known citizens allowed
themselves to be interviewed on the
change in the weather.
Lee Ellis, who never sheds tears
when it gets hot, started an additional
ice wagon.
Col. Green Champlin coined a -new
Russian word to convey his idea and
said, "Itashotashell."
helby Peace said it looked to him
like a conspiracy between the Weath
er clerk and the ice man.
Alex Ovcrshiner said he did not
like to have to drink up all the profits
of his soda fount in order to keep
cool.
CoL Clarence Blakemore, who is
not -only an artist but a poet, quoted
this one:
"What's the use in kicking,
'Taintgwine to help a bit,
Case the weather what you got
Is all you gwine to git."
SOLDIER BOY

homeless, damaged property and

Considering the fact that the mer
cury is up around 100, the question
of uniforms for the rejected soldiers
was given a good deal of importance.
