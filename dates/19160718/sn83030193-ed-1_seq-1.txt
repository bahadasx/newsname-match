Closes Tuckerton Station to
Messages From Dcutschland
Resented by Owners.
BALTIMORE, Md., July IS.-The
United States Government to-day
barred its Tuckerton, N. J., wireless
station to the captain and manager
of tho Oermau aubsca frolghter
Deutschland.
Messages, answering congratuli
tlons from Berlin, and bearing Amer
ican press comment on the Dutitsch
landtrlp, were ruled oft tho apparatus
by tho United States Censor. Tho
Germans and German-Americano
connected with tho submarine ven
ture wero plainly angered at this step,
believing It to bo unneutral.
Whllo they refused to bo quoted,
they Indicated that they feel this act
to be overstepping nil reasonable re
quirements ot neutrality. They said
that absolutely nothing In tho mcs.
sages could bn ot military value, und
that they woro not in code.
Tlio Doutschlund's loading neared
completion this afternoon. Tho last
of tho rubber should bo In hor hold
beforo night, stevedores said. Two
big gasoline tank cars wero backed
up tn tlio wharf to-day, and at least
part of thslr contents will bo dumped
Into tho vessel to feed her tlireo pow.
crful Diesel engines.
Although the Deutschland has not
yet obtained clearance papers, there
aro ninny reasons for believing It may
leuvo to-night.
Manager Illlken snjd It Is "pos
sible" tho Deutschland will await thu
arrival of Its sister ship, Bremen.
An attache of the German Embassy
appeared at the wharf thfs afternoon
and delivered a larne package to Capt.
Koenlfj. It was presumed to be from
Ambassador von Bernstorff and to
contain mall far the Imperial Forolnn
Office. The attache declined to (live
his name.
Off the coast are (several British
and French warships, and somewhere
not far away are American destroy
ers, said to have been sent to sea
thero la no violation of American
neutrality. Tho Deutschland has been
painted to resemble tho ocean, oven
to splotches representing whltccaps.
According to ono thoory, thu
Deutschland will louve hor pier
flanked by tugs enough to conceal
her. These tugs will proceed to sen.
Somewhere tho Deutschland will
drop from '.his hollow squaro anil
bo swallowed up by tho waves. The
tugH will cotitlnuo, nd nobody can
tell tho submarine is not still with
them. But thero Is no oltlclal sanc
tion for tlds story.
An claboruto guard Is over the
Deutschland for her lust hours here,
Thero aro lookouts and sentinels. All
night searchlights played about thu
waters, nnd kept off other vessels. The
tin: Tltnmlns, that met thu Deirtsch
land on her arrival, ban freshly coaled
und Is standing by to carry out the
programme, whatovor it Is.
As no ono hero can Imagine any
reason why the Deutschland should
linger ufter her cargo Is on board, the
assumption Is shu toon will ho dat
ing otr her inooilUN lines. But the
leaving of llullitiuntj behind does not
necessarily Imply an immcdiutti tlfort
to gut lo -a, for In all probability
I'upt. Koeulg will want to utaku a

tho Kaiser Is flfty-seven years of age
