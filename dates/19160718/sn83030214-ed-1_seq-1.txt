Fall Back at Kirlibaba as
the Russian Forces
Sweep On.
[By TaM* to Th? THI ?tr ? 1
Ivondon, July 17.?The Russians
have won an.ither great success in
Volhynia. The hlows of General
Brussiloff's forces southwest of
I. :?-'?; have swept the Austro-Ger
rnan armies behind the Lipa River.
"Under the proteetion of a (ier?
man counter attack," says to-night's
Austrian oflicial statement, "the Teu
tonic troops f.outh of Lutsk were
with.lrawn behind the Lower Lipa,
unmolaMted by the enemy."
At th.* Mine*time (Jeneral Kuro
patkin, the Russian commander in
th?* north, launched a violent offen?
sive against von Ilindenburg's lines
' on thc Dvina River, General Letchit
-,**-* extended his lines near Kirli?
baba, on the frontier of Transyl
vania, and the Czar's forces in Vol?
hynia bagged an additior.al 18,000
prisoners in one short day of fight?
ing.
The latest p-reat Russian advance
i was won throuph intense artiilery
I preparation, followed by quick, pow
efful thrusts at points previously
teatcd and found to be insufficiently
strong to withstand any great press?
ure.
Russians Pieree Foc'b Lines.
Hammering relentlessly at General
von Linsingen's positions southeast of
Sviniuchy and near Pustomyty and
Szklin, the Ruasians finally pierced the
Teuton lines along a mile front at the
latter point and penetrated several
miles into the territory ao obstinately
baid by the enemy for weeks.
This victory again illustrates the
power of the Russian thrusts, the abil?
ity af the Ozar'fl commar.ders to atrike
' at any point along the whole Eastern
front and to atrike with consternating
Ittddeaaeaa and the impotency o." the
German and Austrian armies, however
rall reinforced, to stern the tide of the
Raaaiaa advance except along strongly
fortified natural ba.-riers.
Russian Blow Sudden.
I
The Russians achieved the same re?
sult by the same methods when they
threw the (Ierman forces back from the
Styr to the Stokhod. There the enor
mous forces brought up by the Teutons
have temporarily cheeked the Russian
advance toward Kovel.
Hut while the entire attention of the
Austrians and Germans was being ccn
tred on the Stokhod line, the Russians
were making their usual complete prep
arations for the drive aouth cf Lutsk,
which to-day achieved its pnmary ob
ject. Then they struck o,uickly. For
the first time since the Germans halted
thelr progress on the Stokhod the Rus?
sians took up the cudgels and wielded
them with a riapidity an,l strength
which swept the enemy ofT his feet and
sent him :l>ing to cover.
Menace to Lemberg.
Military critics here are agreed that
the Russians have won a great tactical
succesai. The retirement of the Teu?
tons to the Lipa and beyond greatly
increasea the double menace to which
Kovel and Lemberg are exposed. Stnk
ing south across the Galician border.
oniy a few miles away, the Russiana
would press the Teutons back over the
Bug River, and from that line threaten
Lemberg as it has not been threatened
before in the present drive.
Hitting north and northwest from
their newly won positions. they would
nnperil the German lines along the
Stukhod to a Aank attac/, which prob?
ably would result in the retirement of
the Teulona to the Vladimtr-Volynski
Kovel line. Their present lines on the
north bank of the Lipa constitute the
gravest menace to those two important
places.
Russian Loaaee Severe.
That the Russians have not won their
succesaes without great cost is indi
tated in an Overseas News Agency dis?
patch received here to-day.
"According to ofTicra! reports from
Petrograd." says the atatement, 'in
the period between the beginning ot
the kuaaian offensive and July 1 the
number of Russiane killed reached 14.

of from seventy to eighty business

enemy outside of belligerent territory :
: to trade with his country. Therefore, a
! considerable body of opinion in this
! country urged the government to aban
don iti traditional doetrine, and the
Foreign Office, while not going to this
extreme, decid*d simply to prohibit
persons domiciled in the United King
don from trading with a limited num
be. of individuals, firms or companies
of enemy nationality or association un?
der the same penalties as though they
were trading with an enemy."
The statement cor.tinues:
"It will be clear that this policy em
laodiod in the recent act is purely a
' piece of domestic legislation which only j
interferes with tr.ide, even in the casei ?
I of specitied coneerns, by prohibiting
persons domiciled in the United King?
dom from dealing with these coneerns.
It is a consequence simply and solely
of the exercise of thp right of the state
to limit or control, in the interests of
the state, the trade relations of its own
subjects.
How I'nited Staten Is Affetted.
"As regards the United States list
this may roughly be divided into four
claises:
"Firs* German tirms with head offi
ces or control in Germany.
"Second German firm. incorporated
! in the United States, and therefore
teehnically American entities. We have
dealt with these firms on their merite.
In these cases something more has been
required to qualify them for the itatu
tory list than German nationality,
either assisting the enemy by loans,
propaganda or in regard to contraband.
"Third Fxcept in so far as covered by
the tirst or second quahfications, United
States citizens as a rule have not been
placed on the list. If any are there,
it la because they are sole agents for
enemy tirms resident in enemy terri?
tory.
"Fourth When, however, clear abuse
of cable facilities has been proved, a
firm or individual may be found on the
list. By abuse is meant the u*e of a
secret code or ot cloaks to cover the
fact that cables are being used in a
particular interest. In very few such
caaes will thero be found to bc United
States citizen.."
U. S. Likely to Protest
Trade Discrimination
Washington. June 17. In the absence
of complete details regardmg the ac?
tion of the British government ;n plac
ing business firms and individuals in
the United States upon the BO-COlled
trading with the enemy blacklist,
Stata Department officiais to-night were
unable deflnltely to determine their at?
titude. However, there were indica
tions that new diplomatic repre-enta
tions would lesult should it develop
that American citizens or firms were
being discriminated aga'nst.
Officiais regard it as a clear principle
, of international law that business firm.
\ assume the nationality of the country
| ;n which they are domiciled. An Amer
j ican corporation, even if controlled by
' foreign capital, is entitled to be pro
i tected from discrimination, officiais
: consider. At the same time the Btate
Department recogmzes that Great Brit?
ain has a right to instruct her nation
als not to trade with enemy subjects.
The entire matter will be given care
ful consideration as soon as complete
official information on the subject is
recened. The principle involved in the
trading with the enemy act already ha."
been the subject of ineffectaal protest
by tbe United States,
HAIG TAKES
1,500 YARDS
OF TRENCHES
Troops Now Within
Striking Distance of
Teutons' 3d Line.
-
WATERLOT FARM
IS CAPTURED
British Artillery Fire in
Many Places Increases
in Violence.
[Br C_hl? to T*_ TflHi.--. 1
London, Juiy 17.?General Haig
is now within striking distance of
the Albert plateau, on which lie the
German third line and Bapaume.
Progress has heon made northward
and eastward from the Contalmaison
salient. Tho wedge, growing larger
aadl day, becomes an increasing
menace to the whole line ti Arras.
North of Bazentin-le-Petit Wood
1,600 yards of the German second
line wen* carried by assault. Thus
the wedge was foreed northward.
East of Longueval the Waterlot
farm, a strong (ierman position waa
carried, advancing the wedge east?
ward.
The British hold on the German
second line was strengthened by the
capture of remaining positions in
Ovillers and La Boisselle, at the base
of the wedge. Thus Haig . front has
been carried forward almost to the
crest of the Albert plateau. "Fur?
ther important successes have been
gained," is the orfieial description of
the day*s work.
Raln and Mlat Interfere,
"Rain and heavy mist again in'er
fered with the operations," the War
Orfiee announced to-night, but appar
ently the heavy guns are stili pound
ing heavily at the opposing line.
"Between the sea and the Ancre,"
gays the German statement, "tho
British at many points increased their
fire to great violence."
Thia comparative calm, however, il
merely the prelude to fresh endeavors
to come as soon as the consohdation
of the newly-won British positions is
completed. "Steady and sure." is now
the slogan of the British movement.
It eontrasts sharply with the impetu
oua and futile dashea of many earlier
offenslves.
The eonsolidation of defenees over
six milea of the second German line
is necessarily slow, but extremely
necessary. For the fierce German
counter-attacks must be prcpare 1
against amply.
From Berlin comes an official tele?
gram that the Kaiser is now in the
Somme battle sector, where he haa
made speeches to his army, presented
many Iron Croases and listened ta
reports from hia generala.
Counter Attacks Expected.
The presence of the Kmperor on tha
Picardy front ia accepted as almost
certain indication that the Germana
will launch a very heavy counter at?
tack. It is alao considered a good in
dex of the Teuton strength opposite tha
British lines.
General Haig evidently is adhering
closely to his schedule. He is unmoved
by str.kinn gains, but is pushing stead
, ily forward. The general opinion hera
:s that a great amount of artillery
i preparation remains to bo done.
Meanwhile the Russians, timing their
blows carefully, are forcing the Ger
mans back steadily. The withdrawal
of Linsingen'a troopa southwest of
Lutsk shows that the Czar's foreea
- | . laat none of their vigor and that
the threat to the enemy on two fronta
! is atill growing.
France and Russia Advance.
Both in Russia and in France the
Allied armies have broken through
many lines of defenees and are presa
I ing into comparatively open country.
| With no decrease in the pressure on
I the Kaiser'a lines, the battlea become
' more critical hourly
In local actiona during the rain and
mist the British have captured addi?
tional German prisoners la the Somme
region and brought their total since
! July 1 up to 1?*'J efleera and 10,77'.
; men of otner rank. In additioa, aeven
! teen heavy and 1.13 hghter guns havo
j fallen into British hands during thia
period, not countir.g many not yet
