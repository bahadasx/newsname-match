PUSH GERMANS
BACK 5 MILES
PETPOGRAO, July 18.—The
Germane have retreated nearly
ten miles In Volhynla, under
the advance of Gen. Kaledin's
left wing. In their retirement
aeveral thousand more prison
era, a number of heavy guna
and large supplies of war ma
terial have fallen Into the
handa of the Ruaeiana.
The retreat waa made neces
sary when several Russian reg-
Imenta broke thru the German
front and threatened to aur
round a part of Gen. Von Lln
•ingen'a army.
The Russians have sdvanced
their lines to the north bank of the
river l.lpa and ate strengthening
their new position* on the entire
front.
The advance widens the Russian
salient extending unto the Austro-
Herman front southeast of Kovel,
thus renovlng the danger of crush
Ing enemy attacks on both sides of
the Russian wedge.
BRITISH STILL ADVANCE
I/IN DON. July Ik Despite a
heavy mist and rain, which are in
terferlng with the Homme offen
sive. British troop* made wibstan
Hal progress last night on a front
of I .000 aids In the region of
Ovlller*. Den. Halg reported.
The German* were driven from
several strongly defended polnta
and prisoners and si* Maxims ware
captured.
STRIKE 'BAITING' MUST STOP!
'T'HERE seems to be a concerted effort by certain interests to "bait" water front
* strikers and strikebreakers into riots.
The Star tayi this advisedly, feeling, as it does, that the local dock owners did
not want the strike, and that local strikers have been made the "catspaw" of mis
taken leaders in San Francisco.
There would have been no such riots or bloodshed as have been visited upon
this city if the Water Front Employers' union had lived up to its original intention of
housing imported negro strikebreakers at the docks.
From day to day, more and more of them have been sent out uptown, after their
day's work. Many of them have been armed. Some of them have deliberately
formed into groups to pass the Longshoremen's hall.
THIS MUST STOP!
Nobody not even special policemen—should be allowed to carry guns outside
of the strike zone. Only yesterday two policemen were wounded and a "special
guard'* was killed because the guard was so drunk with his newly-acquired power
that he sought to prevent a raid uptown by the police department's dry squad.
The mayor will be wise to put his contemplated order at once into effect stop
ping guards, as well as strikebreakers, from carrying guns uptown.
In the interests of peace, the employers also could do no greater service than to
keep their men off the uptown streets.

TELLS ABOUT
POLICIES ON
WATER FRONT
Blame for noting, and oilier lawlessness growing out of
thr water front strike, was laid by Mayor < • i)I Tuesday at
the door of employers who permit strikebreakers and guards
to "invite trouble."
I lis position, relative to the strike, was outlined in detail
to a Star reporter in an interview.
"Here in Seattle," said the mayor, "the people prohahlv
do not reali/e that we have been dealing with the biggest
strike in the historv of the city.
"It has been the biggest problem of its kind that has
ever confronted a local police department, and I must confess
that I had been considering myself lucky the way things had
gone until certain elements recently began to open up on me.
"It seemed to me that there wa- about the minimum
amount of trouble. In fact, there has been no trouble at all
on the water front property. It has all been outside of the
strike zone, which has been carefully policed.
Mayor Has Personally Passed
on Men Appointed Special Policemen
"When this present strike started, I told the water front
people that 1 would permit them to have special policemen
on their property. Hut I insisted that I be permitted to pas*
on the men 1 wanted responsible guards. And I insisted
that the employers pay for the guards used on their own
property.
"I told them that the city would police the streets along
the water front, and pay the bills.
"This we have done.
"Now, an inquiry into the police reports shows that all
the trouble has resulted from letting strikebreakers and guards
come uptown.
"They should be kept on the premises, where arrange
ments had been made to keep them. I understood that em
plovers were going to protect their men on their own
property.
Says Strikebreakers Invite
Trouble by Coining Downtown
"Hut they haven't been kept there. They have come
downtown, which is inviting trouble.
"If I were to appoint 200 or 300 special police to use on
the streets, it would simply mean an increase in the tax levy,
and would not solve the problem as long as non-union work
ers kept going downtown.
"I couldn't get that many experienced officers if I wanted
to. The civil service commission couldn't get them. ■
"I don't think the whole city ought to suffer just be
cause a few of these men want to come uptown. I have not
vet decided whether or not to order all guards to leave their
weapons behind them when they are not on the water
front
Declares Effort is Being Made
to Cause an "Open Shop" Campaign
"That is a matter which I want to take up with the
council and talk over. It might help some. Then again, it
might result in more, and worse, fighting.
"It i- an unfortunate thing that these negroes were
brought in here They are bound to cause a lot of trouble.
The employers could have gotten along without them.
"Personally, I think there is an effort being made to bring
about an 'open shop" fight in all industries. And I don't
think it is up to tbe taxpayers to carry the cost of it.
"There hasn't been an act of \ iolence on Railroad ave.
"The force is keeping that part of the city open to traffic.
All Freight Tied Up in Frisco;
Docks Kept Open Here
"In San Francisco they can't move a |>oilnd of freight.
In Seattle we have kept the port open
"Mv have exaggerated in their statements.
"Judge MacMahon hasn't been on the jwilice court bench
for 10 days, and when he was, lie handled things all right.'*
Critics of the mayor's policy during the strike have
pointed out that \ttorney MacMahon, who is attorney for
several labor unions, has been permitted to sit on the police
court bench and try cases involving strikebreakers.
MacMahon is the alternate pokce judge, appointed by
the mayor months ago, to fill the bench in the absence of
Police Judge (iordon.
Says He Intends to Pursue
Same Policy He Has Been Following
"I propose to pursue the policy I have been following,"
went on (till.
"I'll take care of all property and I'll protect all men
when they arc where they belong.
"But 1 will not involve the city in hundreds of thousands
of dollars of expense for extra men to fight out an open shop
campaign for anybody."
The mayor was asked if he was considering the appoint
ment of a citizens' arbitration committee.
"No," he answered, "because the unions have maintained
that they couldn't act independently of San Francisco. So a
citizens' committee is out of the question. That came out at the
beginning of the affair. I have been willing to act along that
line at any tunc when it will do any good."
