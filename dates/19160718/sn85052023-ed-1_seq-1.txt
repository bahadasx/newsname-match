DRUG STORE
IN NEW HANDS
E. R. Coleman Becomes Owner of
The Penny Drug Store, One of
Oldest Establishments Here.
By the sale of the Penny Drug
Store in Stanford to Earl R. Coleman
which was consummated early this
week, this old and well known es
tablishment passes out of the hands
of the Penny family, which had op
erated it for almost half a century.
It was established about 40 yearns
ago by the firm of Chenault & Penny
the latter member of that firm be
irg the late Dr. A. R. Penny. Upon
his death it passed to his widow,
Mrs. Mary Penny, and has been un
der the management of her son,
George L. Penny, for about 15 years.
It is one of the best known drug
stores in this part of Kentucky, and
has always been maintained at an
exceptionally high standard.
Mr. Coleman, the new proprietor
has been pharmacist in the Penny
store for a number of years. He is
one of the best known and finest
young business men in this section,
and starts upon his new work as pro
prietor under auspicious circum
stances. He is the eldest son of Mr.
and Mrs. C. R. Coleman, and is iden
tified in every way with the busi
ness and social life of this section.
A host of friends wlil wish him much
success.
A couple of expert drug men from
the Peter-Neat-Richardson drug
house of Louisville, were here late
last week and made invoice of the
store. They completed their work
the first of the week and the busi
ness was formally turned over to the
new proprietor, who plans to con
duct the establishment along the
most modern and business-like lines.
Mr. Coleman is a registered pharma
cist ard will give especially careful
attention, he says, to this branch of
his business. He will continue to
operate the establishment under the
eld name for some time.
MAT MARTIN BUYS OUT JONES.
Mat Martin, a well known young
business man of Rowland last week
bought out the Jones restaurant and
soft drink stand on Depot street and
has taken possession. Mr. Martin
has many friends who will wish him
much success in his new venture.
John H. Jones, who has been in ac
tive charge of the establishment, has
been in poor health for some time,
his friends are sorry to know.
BOY CAMPERS BACK.
Cn fieonre P. Brijrht with his
tert of boys who spent about 10 days
at Camp Daniel Boone, on the Ken
tucky river, returned Monday after
noon. The boys were M. S. Baugh
man, Jr., Chris Camenisch, Pat Tan
ner, Ross Nunnelley. Will Reinhart,
James Bailey, John Reid McKinney,
Will Bryant, Wm. Tate, Lynn Pence,
Sam Craig, Earl Bryan, Mike Mc
Carty and Fred McCarty. All re
turned safe and sound, some with
out hardly "getting their feet wet."
There were about G4 boys at this Y.
M. C. A. camp during that period,!
ard they came from various points,
Frankfort, Shelbyville, Carlisle and
Flemingsburg in Kentucky and one
or two from California and Louisi
ara. Stanford furnished the dom
inating "bunch" of the camp which
was divided into two "factions," the
"Bulldogs," and the "Too-Tough-To-Tackle"
crowd, Stanford boys lead
ing both sides. In baseball the local
boys payed against all the rest o
the camp and of course came out on
top as well as in tennis, track and
water events and other contests.
Each night a big camp fire was lit
for the boys to sit around and tell
Ftories and during this time Col.
Bright favored the congregations
with many interesting stories con
cerning his days in the Civil War un
der Forest. Much praise is due Mr.
Bright for the interest he showed in
tae boys and they all feel that they
had a better time on account of his
presence, as well as Mr. Bryan's.
Several hikes were taken through
the neighboring woods and beautiful
scenery along the Kentucky River
and all the boys came back feeling
greatly benefitted by their trip and
next year it is hoped that an extra
large crowd may be gotten together
for this recreation.

DANVILLE COURT.
A very small crowd attended Dan
ville court yesterday and business in
all lines was dull. The farmers are
busy and could not leave their work
to mingle with the court day "regu
lars." Oatts & Robinson had a
bunch of yearlings on the market but
had not disposed of them at a late J
hour. A mountain sheep raiser
brought up 140 ewes which sold at
public auction at $7.20 to $7.60.
Several milk cows changed hands at
$40 to $65. Peel, of Jessamine, was
on hand and picked up several army
horses at $98.50 to $105. Neither of
the Congressional candidates was
present and politics was about as
quiet as business was. A heavy rain
fell in the afternoon, accompanied
by a severe wind, which blew down
many shade trees and did other dam
age in and around Danville.
METCALF TO TAKE STAND

when, it is alleged, he knew the in
stitution to be insolvent, will go on
the stand this week in his own be
half, the attorney announced. "I am
going to hew close to the line, let
the chips fall where they may," the
defendant said. "I am going to tell
the truth. I won't attempt to shield
myself, and certainly I will not shield
those who are responsible for this
condition."

SCHOOL PER CAPITA $5.10.
The school per capita in Kentucky
this year was fixed Saturday at $5.10
by Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion Gilbert. This per capita is a
reduction of 15 cents per child of
school age in the state from last
yeor. The per capita is based on an
estimated revenue for school purpos
es for the state at $3,791,785. The
average for teacher per month will
be about $46.25. The school census
for 1916 shows a gain of 2.410 chil
dren of school age over the census
of 1915. According to the census
report compiled by the Department
of Education there are 743,487 chil
dren in Kentucky between the ages
of 6 and 20, of which 667,002 are
white and 76,485 are negroes. Of
this number 112,841 whites are list
ed in the cities and 604,323 in the"
rural and graded districts; 23,323
negro children are listed in the ci
ties and 51,386 in the rural and
graded 'district.
STOCKHOLDERS
TO HOLD BAG
Receiver Appointed for Kentucky
Rural Credits Association
Fraud Is Charged.
The Kentucky Rural Credits Asso
ciation, which was organized with
quite a flourish at Lexington, about
a year ago, went into the hands of
a receiver Saturday and a host of
stockholders over the state will be
left with the bag to hold. Among
them are quite a number of Lincoln
people. A dispatch from Lexington
to the Cincinnati Enquirer Monday
had this to say of the concern, in
which many in this section will be in
terested, as quite a number had plan
ned to make large loans from the
association:
The Kentucky Rural Credit Asso
ciation was incorporated under the
laws of Delaware, but the names of
the incorpoartors do not appear to
be available at Lexington.
The association was authorized to
have a capital stock of $1,000,000
and its business was to make long
term notes on farm lands, secured
by a mortgage, the amount of a loan
in no instance to be greater than 50
per cent of the value of the land
mortgaged. It was part of the plan
to issue bonds for the mortgages
taken, the bonds being secured by
the mortgages and 10 per cent addi
tional put up by the association.
The bonds then were sold by invest
ors. The loans made were for 20 years
on a 5 per cent interest basis, with
stipulated sums payable each year of
the 20 years, steadily reducing the
principal and at the same time pay
ing the interest.
The plan has generally been re
garded by financiers who have look
ed into it as feasible and a good
one if properly administered, but it
is alleged by President McDowell and
others of the Board of Directors
that from the very beginning there
appeared to be a disposition to op
erate for the benefit of the promo
ters and not the stockholders, the
vast majority of whom were farm
ers, it being stipulated in the agree
ments and plans of the association
that no person other than a land
owner could procure a loan. A
Board of Directors of prominent
farmers in the several sections of
the state was announced and in due
time the election of the then Gover
nor, James B. McCreary, at a sala
ry of $5,000 per annum was an
nounced, while Joseph C. Van Meter
was named Secretary at a salary of
$2,400. James L. Watkins, of Lex
ington, was secured for Treasurer
at $2,400 per year. A bookkeeper
was employed at $1,200 per year
and several stenographers were put
to work in offices, the furniture and
fixtures for which cost $2,200.
There are letters in the files in the
offices now which set up the claim
that VanLanningham's force of
-stock salesmen represented to the
farmers buying the stock in the as
sociation that they could secure a
loan after making the second pay
ment of the four payments required
up on each share sold
Theis. thfi
I nrpsfint nffipprs nlnim. was n rlirppf
misrepresentation and that it was
in no way authorized. President
McDowell, however, charges laxity
on the part of his predecessor and
his associates in the matter of meet
ing these claims. Instead of making
it clear to the farmer stockholder
that it was a' misrepresentation they
are said to have adopted a policy of
conciliation, which McDowell asserts
was equivalent to merely prolonging
a certain day of reckoning. ,
Claude Mercer, of Hardinsburg,
who is one of the Directors and a
leading attorney'in his section of the
state, states unreservedly that "a
great fraud has been committed
somewhere," and he believes some
of the money can be recovered.
The present Directors as shown
upon the books of the association
are: James B. McCreary, Richmond;
J. L. Watkins, Lexington; Claude
Mercer, Hardinsburg; R. A. Mc
Dowell, Louisville; P. M. Witt, New
port; J. L. Zarring, Shelbyville; T.
C. Rankin, Lancaster; C. J. Eblick,
La Grange; J. 'Forrest Butts, Car
rollton; William H. Giltner, Emi
nence and John C. Van Meter, Lex
ington. CUPID'S DOINGS.

J. T. Livingston Invents Autb'Fen-
der t Save Lives.
John T. Livingston, a well known
farmer of Lincoln county, lias just
received notification that he has been
granted a patent upon an automobile
fender, which, it is believed, will be
the means of saving many lives. The
technical description of the new de
vice which Mr. Livingston has had
patented, is as follows:
"The device consists of a cushion
ed fender directly in front of the
wheels, supported by a guard rail or
bumper bar and is so arranged that
when a person is struck, the guard
rail or bumper bar yields rearwardly
to a certain extent and the fender
is automatically dropped absolutely
preventing the person from being
run over. The cushioned part less
ening the shock and prevents seri
ous injury. It is attached to the
axle and can be used on any auto
mobile or truck, without yiterfering
with any other part of tne machine.
Experiments are being conducted
with various devices in seme of the
larger cities with a view of reducing
the number of accidents. This inven
tion will be the means of saving
many lives when it is put into use."

GIRL KILLED
IN RUNAWAY
Daughters of Lee Palmer, Garrard
Farmer, in Horrible Accident
Late News from Garrard.
Lancaster, July 18.
Miss Nancy Palmer was killed al
most instantly Saturday when she
and her sister, Miss Ellen Palmer,
were driving down a very steep hill
beyond Back Creek in the Hackley
section of Garrard county It is sup
posed the harness broke, and the
horse becoming frightened, plunged
down the steep decline and running
the buggy against a tree, the girl's
head is supposed to have struck the
trunk from which she suffered a
fractured skull and broken neck.
Miss Ellen Palmer sustained a severe
cut above the eye, and is painfully
though not seriously hurt.
They are the daughters of Lee
Palmer, a prominent farmer of that
section, the deceased girl having
reached her 19th year, and the
younger one being about 17 years
of age. The Misses Palmer are
nieces of Mrs. Emma Higginbotham
of this city. The rough, roclcy hill
is considered one of the most dan
gerous stretches of high-way in this
section, there having been four se
rious accidents in that locality within
the past few years; Mr. John Logan
had his team sometime ago to run
away with, hjm, the horses being
killed, though he was not danger
ously hurt; an estimable negro wo
man was also badly injured by be
ing thrown from a buggy, she sus
taining a double fracture of the leg,
one of the bones being driven into
the ground by the. fall, and she is
still using a crutch, though the ac
cident occurred sometime ago.
Mrs. Beazley and Daughter Hurt.
While Mrs. James A. Beazley and
oldest daughter, Miss Mildred, were
driving in their cart Sunday after
noon, the harness gave way, and
the pony broke into a run, Mrs.
Beazley being thrown from the ve
hicle, and knocked senseless for a
time, she suffering a spraine(lankle
and "severe cuts and bruises. Miss
Mildred was also painfully bruised
and sustained a sprained arm. The
accident occurred in front of Mr.
Alec Walker's residence on Lexing
ton street, and the-jnany friends of
the Beazley family are congratulat
ing them that their injuries were
comparatively slight.
Mrs. Pattie Gill Dead.
The sad information was received
here Saturday morning of the death
of Mrs. Pattie D. Gill at the home
of her daughter, Mrs. E. C. Barnard,
in Washington, D. C, on Friday
night at 10 o'clock. Mrs. Gill had
been in Washington for several
months, and had expressed her in
tention to return to her home here
this summer, but her health had been
such that it was not considered ad
visable for her to make the trip. She
had been a sufferer from heart di
sease for sometime, with other com
plications that required a surgical
operation, but her Washington doc
tors did not consider it safe for her
to undergo the ordeal because of the
cardiac affection.
Mrs. Gill would have reached her
74th milestone had she lived till the
31st day of this month. She was
regarded as one of the most bril
liant women intellectually that Lan
caster has ever produced, and was a
most fluent conversationalist, her
ready repartee and sparkling witti
cisms being proverbial among her
many friends and associates. She
was the eldest daughter of Dr. B. F.
Duncan and Jane L. (McKee) Dun
can, and was not only prominently
allied to the influential Letcher and
McKee relationships of Central Ken
tucky, but was also a grand niece
of the eminent jurist, Chief Justice
George Robertson. She was the
widow of the late Malcolm Gill, one
of the wealthiest of Garrard plant
ers.
She leaves one ' daughter, Mrs.
Edward C. Barnard, of Washington,
City, and a grandson to whom she
was ardently devoted, Joseph Rogers
of Washington, D. C; also four sis
ters, Mrs. W. O. Bradley, of Frank

Ga., Mrs. Richard Warren, of Stan

TWO SPLENDID
JUDGES CHOSEN
To Tie Ribbons On Hrose Rings at
Great K. P. Fair Here Great
Show Assured This Year.
The services of John Dolan, of
Lexington, and Sam Mackin, of Leb
anon,, have been secured as judges
at the K. of P. Fair, to be held at
Stanford, August 23, 24 and 25. Mr.
Dolan has served in that capacity
here for several years and has given
entire satisfaction. Mr. Mackin is
one of the best judges of horse flesh
in the State and will more than like
ly be just as satisfactory.
The catalogue for the big fair is
now in the press and will be out
shortly. The list of special prem
iums is a very liberal one, and the
catalogue as a whole will be one of
the largest and handsomest ever got
ten out by a country fair in this
portion of the state. It wlil be a fit
forerunner of what now gives prom
ise of being the best country fair
ever held in this part of Kentucky.
The local boosters are keeping things
moving all the time. No "liver"
bunch can be found anywhere than
the K. P. boys who are pushing
things for this year's fair. It is go
ing to be a great, big winner and
everybody is boosting for it.
Plans are now being made for a
big delegation of boosters to go to
Danville for the fair there, early in
August. Danville is to have an old
fashioned country fair this year, and
the prospects are for a most success
ful exhibition there. The Stanford
boys will go over en masse and ex
tend a hearty invitation to their Dan
ville brethren to come over to Stan
ford's big show a little later.

ing. Mrs. Hough is the mother-in-law
of State Senator W. W. Booles.
Federal aid for road building will
become possible under the bill which
recently passed both houses of Con
gress. The bill provides an appropri
ation of $5,000,000 for 1916, and in
creases $5,000,000 for five years.
Kentucky's proportionate sum for
1916 will be $115,000, and with a
similar amount from the state treas
ury about 800 miles of road can be
constructed this year. President
Wilson has not yet signed the bill,
but he is reported to regard it favor
ably and will probably do so.
Under this new bill the appropria
tion increases $5,000,000 each year,
thus making better roads possible
in a larger territory. Any state may
affiliate with the national govern
ment in this good road work, and the
government pays 50 per cent, the
state and counties 25 per cent each,
thus lessening the cost of the roads
to county tax payers. Roads which
cost over $10,000 a mile, exclusive
of bridges over 20 feet in lengtth,
will not be aided by the federal gov
ernment. The state must agree to
maintain the roads before the federal
ayl is given. The new plan will not
interfere with state aid work at all.
