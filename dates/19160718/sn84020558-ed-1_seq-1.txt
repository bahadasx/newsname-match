Bad weather has settled down over the fighting front in France. Hos
tilities virtually have ceased for the moment in the Somme region, where
the latest reports had credited to the British additional large gains
against the Germans near Bazentin-Le-Petit wood, in the vicinity of Lon
gueval and at Ovillers-La-Boisseville. Bombardments are in progress
near Souville, in the Verdun sector.
In local actions during the rain and mist the British have captured ad
ditional German prisoners in the Somme region and brought their total
since Ji'ly 1 up to 189 officers and 10.779 men of other ranks. In addition.

gains for them on both the western

Longuevale and Guillemont, besides
completing the capture of the whole

SCATTERED GROUPS IF ILISTJS

CHIHUAHUA CITY, July 17. Sev
eral scattered groups of Villistas have
ehfded the cordon of government troops
which surrounded them in the Rio
Florido bottoms and have reassembled
at Tinajas and Las Escobas, on the
road to Ojinaga and are making their
way north with the object of making
another raid on the American border,
according to confidential advices to
General Jacinto Trevino today.
The advices which came from Santa
Rosalia said the outlaws skirted Chi
huahua Cit,y by traveling in small
groups to the little settlements north
east of here.
General Trevino immediately order
ed the commanders of the garrisons at
Ojinaga and I'iedras Negras to throw i
troops out in an attempt to intercept
the bandits, whose numbers were esti
mated at about two hundred. He
pointed out, however, that the nature
of the terrain is such that some of (lie
outlaws might evade the government
troops and suggested that it would be
well for military authorities on the
American side of the frontier to be es
pecially vigilant.
"With the advent of the rainy sea
son, lie said, "the abundant water
supply makes it easy ror small bands
to deviate from beaten roads and old

troops will do everything they can to
prevent the bandits reaching the

of Chihuauha, announced today that
he had investigated the reported seiz

DOUGLAS, Ariz., July 17. Privatj
R. Tucker, Eleventh infantry, shot an 1
probably fatally wounded Antonio
Rodriguez, a Mexican musician, lato
today, while the Mexican and a com
panion were making their way to
ward the international boundary. One
of them carried a rifle, according to
the guard's statement.
Tucker had not been arrested early
tonight as he had carried out his or
ders to stop any armed Mexicans he
saw on this side of the border.
Tucker and an officer of the Amer
ican army who was nearby, are said
by the military authorities to claim
that the Mexican carrying the rifle
dropped it in the bushes about fifty
yards south of the international boun
dary. They made no attempt to re
cover the weapon.
All American guards are said to
have instructions to fire on any one
bearing arms should they fail to halt
when ordered to do so. They are al
so said to have been instructed to pre
vent any traffic with Mexico here at
any other point than the closely
guarded gate at the American cus
toms house.
Rodriguez and his companion, de
clared however, that they were on the
Mexican soil when the shooting oc
curred. General P. Elias Calles, mil
itary commander of Sonora, tonight
sent a telegram to General Carranza
which, it was said, protested in strong;
terms against the desecration of Mex
ican soil and the lilierties of Mexicans.
Adolfo de la Huerta, governor of
Sonora, sent a similar protest, under

stronger language, to Jesus Acuna,
minister of foreign relations in tho
Carranza cabinet. Ives G. Lelevier.
Mexican consul here, telegraphed to
Eliseo Arredondo, ambassador-designate
of the Mexican government in
Washington, requesting that he pro
test to the state department and de
mand redress.
Lelevier also visited General T. F.
Davis to urge him to investigate the
case and punish the sentry. General
Davis promised to make an investiga
tion, Lelevier said.
According to the story of Pina, he
and Rodriguez were unarmed. Thev
had been on First street in Douglas
and started for Agua Prieta, as the
customs house, the usual place for
crossing, was nearly half a mile dis
tant, they decided to cross the boun
dary a few yards from where they
then were. They did so, not noticing
any American soldiers to be in that
vicinity, he said.
After they had reached Mexican ter
ritory, Pina said in his statement to
the Mexican officials, he heard a shot.
He turned to see where it had been
fired from and saw the American sol
dier throw the ejector of his rifle, then
throw a cartridge into the breech of
his gun. Pina said he dropped to the
ground but that Rodriguez, who was
near-sighted and unable to see the sol
dier, walked on until the fifth shot
fired by the soldier struck him and
he fell. At that time he was about
eighty yards south of the border, but
dragged himself fifteen yards further
before he fell.
Several Mexican border guards ran
to the place where Rodriguez lay and
the American sentry was re-enforced.
The shooting was reported to General
Calles who was with Governor De la
Huerta. Consul Lelevier was sum
moned from Douglas, being accom
panied by an Associated Press repre
sentative. Calles apparently was excited as waa
De la Huerta.
"This is the sort of treatment my
people are given, after all I have done
for Americans," Calles exclaimed. He
and De la Huerta instructed the con
sul to proceed to the spot and inves
tigate, which he did, accompanied by
the newspaper man.
Rodriguez was approximately one
hundred yards south of the border, but
whether he had been carried there or
had fallen where he was found, there
was no way of telling. Both he and
Pina told practically the same story to
the consul and Comisario J. Pena
lopez. Rodriguez was carried on a stretch

admitted that better conditions might
be found.
The regular troops will be left at
Laredo and a small detachment of the
guards but he said he would move most
of the 8,000 away from the town, hold
ing them at some point on the rail
road from where they could be moved
quickly to the border if their services
were required.
Reports from General Pershing and
from border commanders were char
acterized as routine.
