WERE TO HAVE BEEN
Roadster Going at High Speed Plunged Into Side of Loco
motive at Dangerous French's Crossing Skulls of Both
Crushed and Many Bones Broken Were Returning
After a Week-end at New London.
(Special to The Bulletin.)
Plainfield, July 17 Arthur E. Park
of the Bay State Shellac company of
Kail River. Mass., and a woman com
panion, who for hours afterwards was
believed to be his wife, were Instantly
killed at French's 'crossing, in the
town of Plainneid, just alter S o'clock
this morning- when Park drove his
car against the forward left side of a
passenger train bound from Provi
dence for Wi'.limantie.
Park and his companion, identified
during the day as Miss Anna K. dish
ing of Providence, had the top of their
heads torn off when they plungeil
through the windshield of their car,
a pract ica lly new Packard twin-six
roadster, and were dashed against the
Bidrt of the locomotive only to lie
hurled, back, with their car to a point
only a few feet from the track.
Made Desperate Effort to Stop.
Stories circulated at the crossing
within a fow minutes after the acci
dent set up the claim tiiut Park, a Half
mile back from where the accident
took place, was bowling- along at high
speed. The cross ins is what some
call a blind one, protected by an au
tomatic gong, which was found by
tests made immediately after the ac
cident to be !n working order. The
L' akes on Park's car were set .up tlht,
showing that lie had at least made a
desperate effort to stop, but he could
not possibly have seen down the track
a sufficient distance to slop his ma
chine if he was driving as fast as
claimed, because the view is obstruct
ed. Park was driving north along the
highway, the main automobile road,
from Plainlieki to Central Villa so,
when he was struck, and the train wras
running- fium Moosttp to Plainneid.
Engine Crew Didn't See Auto.
That the train whisMed fur the
crossing is attested by David Adams,
who was about to It ad a cow across
the truck from a bar-.!, nearby, but
who waited, after he. a n r wnlstle.
f r tiie tram tu ;j;sj. did not see
the crash toiweeri .:.: a , : cmobile and.
lorenvtive, for the train obstructed
his view. Xeith-a- did the eimine
crew. Engine-!- Kuward Chapman and
Fireman T. U. Aidrich, both of Prov
idence, knew the nature of the acci
dent that occurred until they ha, 'I
brought the truin to a standstill to
investigate the cause of a rr.isn they
le-ard followed by what afterwards
proved to be the r.-uie of parts of
the automobile rolled along the track
by the locomotive lor a distance of
approximately 20J leer.
Car a Total Wreck.
Upon leaving the eoaehet; passen
gers were horrified at the si;;ht oeforo
him. The victims lay close together
on the ground, just in front of the
roadster, which was a tola! wreck,
parts of it scattered all about. Pro
bate Judge John K. Prior, of the town
of Plaintield, who was a passenger on
the train, H. B. Chapman and others i
immediately sent out warnings, calls I
for Medical Kxaminer VV. W. Adams '
-Moohup, and Coroner Arthur G. Bill, (
iJanielson, was also notiiied. i
Park Had $8,000 on Person.
Judge Prior helped very materially
in starting the effort to identify the
victims. Prom bankbooks, papers and
cards found in Mr. Park's pockets it
was not difficult to fix (lis identity,
which was quickly verified. It was
Jater found that he had nearly TS.OOO
(n money and checks on his person.
These valuables with his own dia
mond ring- and diamond and pearl
Btickpin were turned over to Coroner
C Bill, as were bankbooks showing
heavy accounts with the Massassoit
Pocassit and Fall River National
banks of Fall River.
Woman Wore Many Jewels.
The dead woman's fingers were cir
cled by a number of beautiful and ex
pensive rings, set with diamonds,
pearls and emeralds. From about her
neck was suspended a magnificent
platinum lavilier, set with a number
of small diamonds and suspending a
diamond of larger size. This piece of
Jewelry and the five ' valuable rinys
she wore are said to be worth, with
Mr. Park's, from $l,o00 to $2,000. One
of a pair of Iar(ge diamonds that were
pet In one ring on fhe woman's finger
Was Lwisted out of the setting and is
lost at tho scene of the accident. An
other ring worn by the woman wag
a plain gold band. There was another
plain gold band ring, taken from the
finger of 'Mr. Park, that bore the in
scription, Lewis to Anna, October,
1905.
Crushed Skulls and Broken Bones.
The examination of the bodies by
Lr. Adams showed that in addition to
the crushed skulls the victims had
broken bones, arms, leg's and ribs.
Mr. Park lay with one arm sticking,
through the frame of the windshield,
his companion beside him. The map's
Skull was split open, as one' would
split a cocoanut, the top part jying
back, and emptied of all that ha4 a
few minutes before ben its directing
and guiding content The top' bi the
woman's head was. also torn qff. One
of her legs was broken in three "places,
one arm broken and ribs on each side
crushed in.
Woman Was, Mot Known.
After the investigation fey the ireSl"
cal examiner and Coroner Jill the
bodies were removed : by "Undertaker
Frank Tillinghast of Central Village,
The wrecked car way removed to jlill
igan's garage at "Wauregan.
It was not until Coroner Bill got
in touch with the office pfthe Bay
State Shellac company at Fall River
that it was learned that Park's, com
panion was not his wife. A man who
represented himself tp, be "(he man
ager of tl)e cqneern said tq Mr. Bill
that he tiad no means of knowings who
the woman was;- ifo ajso infqrmed
Mr. Kill that Mr. Park's "father waif

did arrive later.

E.
MARRIED THIS MONTH
small tan leather handbag and other
things in the car would indicate that
the couple ha,d been to some beach
resort for the week end. In a rub
berized bag were two bathing suits,
wet, which fact taken with the state
ment of automobile tourists who -happened
along- before the car had been
removed would Indicate that the dead
couple had spent Sunday in or about
New London, possibly at Ocean Beach.
This tourist, who declined to give his
name, but who drove a Massachusetts
car, said he saw the wrecked car in
a garage at New London Sunday.
There was only one small handbag
in the car, and this contained articles
evidently owned, as to different arti'
cles, by the man and woman.
Woman's Shoe Twisted From Foot.
The woman's coat was a medium
blue corduroy with the lapel of
"Liedell," Providence, sewed on the in
side of the collar. She wore a light
summer dress, .pink stockings, low,
white rubber-hoied shoes and a straw
crush hat, banded with pink ribbon
a touring- costume of simplicity. It
was considered remarkable that one of
her low white shoes was twisted from
her foot and lay on the mud guard at
the rear of the machine, which was
twisted around when it struck the lo
comotive and headed in the direction
from which it had been coming.
Dents in the Locoomtive.
The train that figured in the wreck
w?s held at the crossing for more
than an hour. All of the members
of the crew, including those mention
ed, were interviewed by Coroner Bill.
The conductor was Kverett O. Wood
ward, the trainman K. I. Francis, both
of Provideinec. It was learned by Mr.
Bill that those on the train and in
charge of its operation were agreed
that, the first they heard was the
crash of the automobile against the
hide of the locomotive as the big ma
chin" was square on the crossing'. The
impact came just back of the pilot,
a dent in the locomotive showing the
piaee. A step was ripped off the lo
comotive as the hig machine sped
along in contact with the automobile.
Identification Made by Sister.
From various clues that were ob
tained during the day the identity of
the dead woman was established for
a. cere inty by the arrival of Mr. and
Mrs. Bournwood of Middloboro, Mass.
-Mrs. Bournwood is her sister and she
was shocked when she saw the body,
which !;he made sure was that of Miss
Anna F. dishing, 2(5 years old, of 26
'JiO'e street, Providence. Miss Cash
ing had boarded at that address with
Mrs George J. Williams about five
years.
Was Engaged to Parks.
Mrs. Williams stated tonight that
she was engaged to Parks and they
had intended to be married this
month. The couple left there Satur
dav to visit friends in New London
and were on their way back when the
; '-anient occurred. Miss dishing had
,e. married, it was stated, but was
.orced. She came to Providence
from Middleboro, Mass., where she
leaves a brother and sister, Calef
Cushing and Mrs. Clara Bournwood.
Man's Parents Were in Danbury.
Mr. and Mrs. Edward A. Parks of
Fall Liver, the parents of the dead
man, were visiting in Danbury today
and left for Plainfield by automobile
immediately after being informed of
the accident.

VfLLISTA BANDITS
ELUDE DE FACTO TROOPS
Two Hundred of the Outlaws on Way
North to Border.
r
Chihuahua City, July 17. Several
scattered groups of Villa followers
have eluded the cordon of government
troops which surrounded them in the
Rio Florido bottoms and have re-assembled
at Tanajas and Lns Escobas,
on the road to Ojinaga and are making
their way north with the object of
making another raid on the American
border, according to confidential ad
vices to General Jacinto Trevino to
day. The advices which came from Santa
Rosalia said the outlaws have skirt
ed Chihuahua City by traveling in
small groups to the little settlements
northeast of here.
General Travino immediately or
de-red the commanders of the garrb
sons at Ojinaga and Piedras Negraa
to throw troops out in an attempt to
intercept the bandits, whose numbers
were estimated at about 200. Ho
pointed out, however, that the nature
of the terrain is such that some of the
outlaws might evade the government
troops and suggested that it would bo
well for military authorities on the
American side of the frontier to be
especially vigilant.
"With the advent of tho rainy sea
son," he said, "the abundant water
supply makes '4 easy for small bands
to deviate from beaten roads and old
waterholes. However, the Mexican
troops will do every thing they can
to prevent the bandits reaching tho
American border."
Francisco L. Trevino, civil governor
of Chihuahua, announced today that
he had- investigated the reported
seizure of the Harst ranch at Pabico
rn. and had determined, he said, that
the property was not confiscated but
that the "cattle were merely detained
to prevent the possibility of their be
ing moved across the border without
paying duty."
Reports from General Luis Herre
ra at Parral today indicated quiet in
that district. General Matins Ramos
has not yet engaged the main Villa
band, which is surrounded in P.io Flo
rida district he said, but is pressing
them slowly.

NEW THEORY AS TO SHARKS.
Gulf Stream Has Taken Unexpected
Curve Toward Long Island.
New York. July 17. A new theory
to explain the presence of large
schools of sharks along the North At
lantic seaboard was offered by Cap
tain William Jensen of the United
Fruit steamship Calamares which ar
rived here today. He expressed the
belief that the gulf stream has curved
towards the coast and that tropical
fish of every variety soon will abound
in the waters of Long Island. Two
hundred miles from New York Sun
day night, Captain Jensen said, the
temperature of the water was 74 de
grees, unusually high for that latitude.

16 Capital Ships
Within 3 Years
OOMMITTE'S RECOMM EMDATION
ALMOST SURE OF APPROVAL
EXPECT PASSAGE TODAY
Amendments to Delay Construction
and to Create International Peace
Tribunal Tabled America Has Not
One Friend Among All the Nations,
Says Senator Lewis.
Washington, July 17. Discussion of
the Naval building programme in the
senate today brought out indications
that the committee recommendation
for construction of 16 capital war
ships within three years, eight of them
in 1917, ' probably would be approved
without material amendment. Admin
istration leaders hoped tonight to pass
the bill before adjournment tomorrow.
Peace Measure Tabled.
Such opposition as developed today
came from both sides of the chamber.
Senators Thomas and Vardaman (dem
ocrats), and Senators Works and JCor
ris (republicans), leading the attack
on the building programme. Both
democratic and republican leaders de
fended it. however, and amendment bv
Senator Xorrls to delav construction
of any of the 16 capital ships until aft
er the close of the European war, and
after failure of efforts to create an
international peace tribunal, was ta
bled, 43 to 11.
In support of his amendment Sena
tor Xorris declared the bill provided
for expenditure of more money for
naval construction in time of peace
than was ever spent bv anv nation In
the world, despite the f;v?t that "it is
very probable that before this Europ
ean war is over the United States,
without, the construction of a single
ship, will have the greatest navy in
the world.
Charged Congress With Hysteria.
Senator Vardaman declared congress
was yielding u hysteria, and caution
ed against expenditures of such vast
sums for armament uniii the coun
try's cool, normal judgment could be
consulted. Senator Xorris opposed
the. construction of so many big ships
and urged them submarines and air
craft, would be' sufficient protection
for a nation which does not contem
olato offensive warfare. Senator
Works predicted that passage of the
naval bill would, mark a change in
military policy that would overturn
tiie peaceful spirit of America.
Borsh For P,ej5arednes3.
Senators Lewis (democrat) and Tlo
rah, Weeki and Kenyon (republicans)
spoke in favor of the measure. Sen
ator Lorah urged that if the United
Slates wa.s to enjoy the blessings of
peace, it must convince the world it Is
prepared for war.
"Let use seme notice on the na
tions of the world," said the Idaho sen
ator, "fhat, while we love peace and
cove! their regard, our friendship cfin
not be purchased at the price of Amer
ican citizens."
Japan's Entrance Into War,
Penal. ir Li wis urged that tho people
be told tho frank truth about foreign
relations so that they would demand
an ade r.ivy. He pointed out
Japan's entrance into the present war
for the purpose of ousting Germany
from the Far Fast, and inquired if any
one believed that "She would not en
force against America what she en
forced against Germany and would
call upon her present allies to help
her in a war against the United
States."
Have Offended All Nations.
"America today has not one friend
among all the nations of the world,"
said Senator Lewis. "We have of
fended all from their point of view.
We have severed all from our point
of right. Let us go to the people of
our country with our reasons for this
extraordinary preparedness. Tell them
we move forward because we must in
order to live."

fore the adjournment for tho autumn
recess and repented that the whole
Irish question Will be submitted to an
imperial conference after the war.
It is understood that the bill will
not be presented until next week, and
In the meantime the delay is allowing
opposition to crystalize which threat

measure is to have anything but a
smooth passage.

"I found the president embarrassed
by the thought that he ought not tio
turn to politics until the business of
this congressional session was over.
Of course, it is possible that the ses
sion may not Jast so long as to make
it impracticable to wait until its close
for the notification, particularly as
the president feels it to be of the ut
most importance that the child labor
bill and the workman's compensation
bill be passed at this session, but the
president feels it to be his duty to
postpone the notification ceremony if
possible until the adjournment of
congress."
Mr. McCormick also announced that
the notification would be at Shadow
