Retreat Made Necessary When Russians Broke Through
(jerman rront Slav Armies In Bukowina Attacking Re
l inforced Austrians-Germans Launch Fierce Counter
' Attacks Against French-AIso Attacked Verdun .
Petrograd, July 18. The Germans have retreated
nearly ten miles, in Volhynia under the swift advance of
Gen. Kaledin's left wing.
In their hasty retirement several thousand more
prisoners, a number of heavy guns and large supplies of
war material have fallen into the hands of the Russians.
The retreat was made necessary when several Russian
regiments broke through the German front and threat
ened to surround a part of Gen. Von Linsingen's army.
The Russians have advanced their lines to the north bank
of the River Lipa and are strengthening their new posi
tions on the entire front. The advance widens the Rus
sian salient extending into the Austro-German front
southeast of Kovel, thus removing the danger of being
crushed by the enemy at both sides of the Russian wedge.
All along the eastern front the Czar's armies have sud
denly resumed the initiative. The Russian left wing in
Southern Bukowina is again in motion against the rein
forced Austrian army. The infantry combats are becom
ing more frequent in Galicia and both artillery and infan
try activity are reported on Gen. Kuropatkin's front in
fhe Dvinsk-Riga region on the north.
The Russian commanders on the Austro-German
front, however, are compelled to share public interest
with the grand duke Nicholas, whose new offensive con
tinues to make progress. l

Will Investigate
Oxygen Explosions
San Francisco, July 18. The state
industrial accident commission today
started an investigation of the causes
of M series of exvgcn tank explosions
in four days, with, loss of life for sev

plant furnishing exygen tanks, made
a careful inquiry, and the chemists
were unable to explain the mystery,
finding nothing wrong with the tanks.
The death toll of the tank explo

when Edward H. Berry, boiler maker,
fatally injured in the third exp)osion
in the plant at the Hercules 1'owder

Health, Strong, Vigorous
and Filled
ew lork, July 18. Kaiser Wilhelmj
is far from being the haggard, worn'
old man he has been nictured recentlvi
he
is hale and hearty, sunburned and
ess and absolutely confident ot
, , ',
tireless
teutonic success,
This was the word brought back to
the 1'nited States today by Judge Al
fred K. Nippert, common pleas judge
in Cincinnati, who has been iu' Ger
many for three months and who,
June 24, enjoyed an opportunity to
study the German emperor throughout
an entire evening when he was his
guest at the front.
"I was the kaiser s guest at the
STaiid headquarters in the west.
Judge Nippert said, on arrival here on
the steamer r redenck 1 1 X.
I took diruier with him at 4
0 clock and afterward was with him
until midnight. I was surprised at
his appearance. I had expected, ac
cordin" to continental newspapers, to
see a man haggard, worn and decrepit.
"Of course, the kaiser is 57 years
or age now ami his hnir would natur
ally be a little gray, but I saw a man
whose face was sunburned and flushed
wi'h health. He waived me up aud
down iu his gnritca for two hours
and nearly walked me off my feet."
Nippert went abroad as representa
tive of the German societies of the
1'nited Htutes who are trvinit to re
build east Prussia after the ravages
suffered bv the Cossack invasion.
East Prussia has I'een more want
only ravished," Nippert declared,
than Belgium, the Balkans or any
other part of the war stricken zone.
The Russians who invaded there were
not content with destroying for mili
tary purposes, but they wantonly de
stroying everything in sight. Worst
of all they made captive ten thousand
women and cnildren some mere babes
arms who have presumably been
transported to Siberia. When 1 talked
to the kaiser, he was particularly in
terested in these poor captives. He
said it was a mighty fine thing for the
people of the Inited Mates to be send
in? money to rebuild Kast Prussia, but
hat he was far more interested in
the fate of these women and- children.
He expressed the hope that as a neu
tral power now representing Germany
in Kussia tnat tne united elates
would do all possible to restore these
non combatants to Germany.
"I found the kaiser absolutely opti
mistic as to the outcome of th war.
I can quote him as saving 'Kuch a peo
ple as my people are not doomed to.
defeat. Ther are destined for vie
tory.' "

personal appeal ou the emperor's

and hopes to see the president tomorrow
or Friday.
"The eonperdr showed real emotion
when talking of these women and
children," the judge said. "He told me
'I have an army which is able to take
care of itself and take enre of our
frontiers, but the capture of the women
and children is not war.' "
Pacific Mail to
Resume
Service
New York, July 18. The Pacific
mail steamship company which aban
doned its service to the orient a year
ago, declaring the La Folletto sea
meas' act made it impossible to contin
ue a profitable business, today an
nounced the resumption of service be
tween Sun Fruneisc-o aud the orient
on Aug. lit.
The company has bought the steam
ers Kucador, Veneruela and Colombia
at a cost of $1,100,000 each from the
Kojal Dutch West India Mail company
The Kcuador will snil from San Fran
cisco Aug 19, the Venezuela Sept. 10
and the Colombia Oct. 7.
Officials said that if the venture
proves profitable they will install a
fleet of steamers in the new service.
Hih freight rates asul the fact that
the company has been divorced from
control by the Southern Pacific rail
way, makes them believe they can
make money, ttiey said.'

CAPTAIN SATS GOOD BYE '
Baltimore, Md., July 18.
Here is the auf weidersahn of
Captnin Koenig of the first
transatlantic submarine
freighter as given to the United
Press for the . people of the
United Iptates:
'"Ihr land nnd stadt gefallt
mir. sehr, und ich hoffe bald
Kuruckzukqmmen. Die leute in
Baltimore sind sehr freundlich
zu unB gewesnn."
Translated this means
. . Your country and your city
please me much and I hope to
come bnck soon. The people iu
Baltimore have been very
friendly to us."
' .Captain Koenig wasn't saying
today that he would leave right
away, but consented as a "pre
paredness" advocate, to give
out the above farewell just as a
matter of caution . so nobody
could -any he had not made the
- people 'good bye. - '
." By Carl D. Groat .

States government today barred its

submarine Dcutschland,
Messages answering congratulations
from Berlin and bearing American press
comment on the Deutschland trip, were
ruled off the apparatus by the United
states censor. The Germans and German-Americans
connected with the sub
marine vcutrc were plainly angered at
this Btep, believing it to be unneutral.
. While they refused to be quoted
they indicated that ihey feel this act to
bo overstepping all reasonable require
ments of neutrality. They said that
absolutely nothing in the messages
could be of military value and that they
were not in code.
The DeutBchland's loading nenred
completion' this forenoon. The last of
the rubber should be in her hold before
night, stevedores said. Two big gaso
line cars were backed up to the wharf
today und at least part of their con
tents will be dumped into the vessel to
feed her three powerful Diesel engines.
Agents of the ship kept quiet as to
the timo of her departure.
Baltimore, Md., July 18 The German
super-submarine Deutschland was still
at her pier here early today. As far as
could be learned, though, she intends to
dash for the Virginia capes tonight.
One of the Germans connected with
the venture aunounced early today that
she lias gone, a statement from A. Schu
macher ami company's offices, however,
was that "anything we tell you about
the leaving time will be a d d lie."
Despite this policy of mis-information,
everything points to an early get
away. The tug Timmins. hoveriag close
to the ship and her precious cargo, is
fully coaled. The last of the visitors
will be taken on the submarine to
day, and some crew members, not un
der orders to misinform, say she is
i a
iieaiiiHg uiil tumm.
Negro stevedores put in a busy night
tucking away the last of the cargo and
this work was due to be finished to
day.
laptain Koenig refused to worry
nbout the reported presence of an allied
war vessel cordou otf the capes. He
told friends he would get home safely.
. The captain of an incoming steamer
said today that England has a big fleet
of warships and trawlers and a line of
nets in the English channel, ready for
the submarine. He believes the British
policy will be to let the Deutschland
pan the capes safely, with a view to
seizing her later.
