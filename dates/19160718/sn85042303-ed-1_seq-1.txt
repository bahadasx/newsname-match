"'Ware Sharks!" Cry at New York Beaches;
Four Killed, one Maimed, by Sea Monster
CUOWDICI)
Beach resorts near New York were thoroughly alarmed by the recent attacks of sharks on bathers, resultiiift in
four deaths and one maiming, and feured the killing of the season unless the shark were captured speedily. Hun
dreds of men, with rifles, spears, dynamite and nets, searched New Jersey waters for the man eating shark that
in its third attack since July 2 killed two men and two boys and maimed another boy. The scare that has gone
the rounds of many New Jersey resorts since the first shark raid on bathers has not reached Coney Island and
other places near New York, but bathhouse keepers said they would take precautions against a visit from sharks,
although they do not believe there is any danger. Lite guards will bo stationed beyond the life lines to wutch
for possible approach, and if necessary the men will he armed. Fishermen will be stationed on piers with baited
shark hooks. Men familiar with the habits of fish an; frankly puzzled over the shark raids. Assuming that one
man eater is responsible, it must have a long beat. It has been seen at Spring Lake, N. J., and at Bridgehampton,
N. Y. If it is the same shark that went to Matteawan it must have skirted all of the lower bay of New York and
at some time within the last few days passed Coney Island and the Rockaways. Pictures show a crowded bath
ing beach near New York and a man eating shark.

WOULD KEEP PEOPLE AND THEIR
COURTS CLOSE TOGETHER
FORMER CANDIDATE STRONG
FOR LITERACY TEST.
Judge J. B. A. Robertson says:
"No democrat can afford to stay
away from the polls on primary elec
tion day this year. The constitution
al amendment prescribing an educa
tional test for voters, commonly Bpok
en of ns the new grandfather clause,
Is entitled to the hearty support of
every white man In the state regard
less of party affiliation.
"Space will not permit a discus
sion of the justness and propriety of
such an addition to our fundamental
law, but, unless the white people of
this state rally to the support of this
proposed amendment, wo may expect
an Influx of Illiterate, degenerate and
criminal negroes from all neighboring
states who, under present laws and
supreme court decisions, will Insist
upon 'equality' in the matter of voting
and will, under the peculiar conditions
existing in this state, prove a menace
to good government; a danger to
women ,and the home; a lowering of
our standards of citizenship; an In
crease in the cost of government; a
depreciation in value of all classes of
property and a generally disturbed
and unsatisfactory condition, socially
and otherwise. For the good of the
state, the citizens thereof and un
born generations, let us rally to the
support of this amendment. The only
way we can render effectual assist
ance Is by going to the polls on elec
tion day and by seeing that all demo
crats do likewise.
"I am at the same time, however,
unalterably opposed to the pending
amendment which has for Its object
the abolishment of the county court;
this Is a vicious and wholly useless
and uncalled for attack upon one of
the most useful arms or our state
government. I cannot think of a
single good reason in favor of the
amendment, but can name a score of
good reasons against It Let us keep
the courts close to the people. This
amendment' is but another step to
wards centralization of power. Let
all good citizens resent such tenden
cies by voting against the abolish,
ment of the county courts."
