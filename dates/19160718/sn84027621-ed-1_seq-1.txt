CR.YSTAL RIVER
Considerable Excitement Caused
by
Bad Behavior of a Drunken
,:'- Negro
Crystal River, July 17. Excitement
was at white heat Saturday afternoon
in Crystal River. A little before five
o'clock a negro, Henry ManueL insult
ed a white man and got a drubbing for
his ains. This did not seem enough
for the rascal, however, and he secur
ed a rifle and boisterously declared his
intentions of killing the ' white man.
Several colored people tried to take
the, rifle and dissuade" him from his
purpose. He was determined , how
ever and started on his errand. The
white man in question was Mr. H. V.
Cooksey, manager of the Marion Fur
niture Co., and it was to the furniture
store the negro, was bent on croinsr to
fulfirf his bloodthirsty mission. Mrs.
Charpia at the -ice factory; was in
formed by some of the colored people
and at once phoned tfce marshal to ar
rest the brute with the gun. The ar
rest was made and the nec-To taken
before Mr. Cooksey for identification.
The marshal then nut him in a car
and started to . the lock-up. As the
car started, the jiegro slipped out and
started to run. The marshal fired at
him several times but missed," and one
or- two citizens took up the chase and
began firing. These were immediately
joined by others on foot and in cars,
and it was hardly five minutes before
a large-posse was m pursuit, all firing
in rapid succession. It was not until
dark, howover, that the posse succeed
ed in capturing the culprit. No less
than four or five hundred shots were
fired at him andfonly one bullet struck
him. He was brought down by t. rifie
bullet which shattered his left shoul
der. He was taken to tha (imra
and
Dr. Irwin dressed ? his wound.
There was some talk of lynching, but
the wiser heads prevailed. Every
thing seems to have quieted down and
no fears of further trouble are enter
tained. x - .

EENINO
FLOBIDA, TUESDAY
TO BE HELD
. 9, TO
At a meeting Monday night of good
roads enthusiasts, in the rooms of the
Commercial Club, further steps were
taken with a view, of calling "an elec
tion for an issue of bonds in the sum
of $900,000, for the purpose of giving
Marion county a system of permanent
roads, that will place her with the
rapidly increasing number; of counties
of the state now in the ront ranks.
It was proposed that the bonds be
serial bonds issued on a basis of 30
years, and figures were presented to
show that thus issued the bonds
would not raise the taxes of the coun
ty, but would permit a decrease of the
present millage. Or, if the county
wished to retain- the present millage,
an increasingly large sum would be
available for road work over and
above the building of the roads with
the money obtained from the sale, of
the bonds. f ?
Monday, August 7, was decided on
as the day for the convention in Ocala
for the purpose of ascertaining the
sentiment of the county with regard
to the bond issue. In the meantime a
committee, consisting of W. D. Cam,
David S. Welch and E. M. Osborne,
will whip into shape the figures show
ing just how the money is to be spent
This information will be got out as
soon as possible, in order that the
meetings might be held in the various
precincts to select delegates to the
convention here. " ' '"
If the convention on August 7 goes
on record as favoring bonds, the coun
ty commissioners, meeting in regular
session the next day, will be asked to
call an election and to select a first
class engineer to prepare V specifica
tions for the roads. The intention) as
already announced, is to have specifi
tions prepared and contracts then let
for the building of the roads,he con
tracts to be subject to the vote of the
people. In this way every voter will
know whether he is to be benefited, or
not. He will know just how the bond
money is to be spent.
. It was agreed last night that the
important things to be considered
about ?the proposed issue are: the ef
fect on taxes, and the proper spend
ing of the money. The concensus of
opinion was that the bond issue would
carry without any doubt, if it is shown
that there will be ho increase in taxes,
no graft, and that every section of the
county will be benefited.
FLORIDA FIRST CAMPAIGN
WILL NOT FLICKER
Both advertising campaigns of the
Florida First Commission will go
through without a hitch. This is
vouched for by H. D. Silverf riend, of
Estero, who was here for a few hours
this afternoon, on his way from Pa-
latka to Bushnell. Mr. Silverf riend,
who is in the field for the commission
linine up the towns and cities, said
that the first of the campaigns would
start August 10 and run until Novem
ber 1. and the second campaign will
run through December, January and
Februarv. Already more than ?14,000
has been pledged, Jacksonville having
come in last week.' ;
Mr. Silverfriend obtained the
nlede-e of Palatka 'last night to Join
the campaign, and Gainesville the day
before. Mr. Silverfriend is a promi
nent teacher and lecturer and, like the
others connected with the Florida
First Commission, is serving without
remuneration; His expenses only are

PASS Oil QUEST! OF
ITYv . .
CATTS 1ST SUBMIT
TO A IE-CDDIIT
Supreme Court Refuses Him a .Writ
of Prohibition Against '
Will Knott
Tampa, July 18. A special to the
Tribune from Tallahassee says:
The supreme court has denied the
writ of prohibition asked by Rev. Sid
ney J. Catts to be directed against
Circuit Judge Simmons of Duval
county, and ordered an alternative
writ of mandamus issued in the case
of W. V. Knott versus the county can
vassing board and all inspectors and
clerks in Putnam county, such writ
being made returnable before the su
preme court at 10 o'clock a. m. July
27th.
The other petition against the
county canvassing board alone of Put
nam county is held in abeyance. All
orders issued by the court were made
unanimous and without written opin
ion. , .- v '
These orders mean that the recount
asked for in Duval county of some
several precincts by W. ,V. Knottvin
his contest against S J. Catts, the de
clared democratic nominee for V gov
ernor, will be allowed and that Knott
is in a very fair way to secure recount
of all the precincts in Putnam county
unless the attorneys for Catts can
show good reason on July 27 why this
should not be done. ' ' ' ; ' " '
Opens Way for Further Recount
This would apparently open .the way
for further recount in other counties.
Knott has declared that he will go
into some twenty-odd counties alto
gether in an effort to prove that there
was miscount of the vote, particularly
the second choice vote, and, in some
instances, downright violation of the
primary law. -He claims that the re
count! in " Madison, Suwannee and
Hamilton counties, already made, has
given him enough extra votes to wipe
out the less than 300 plurality Catts
had and that the final tabulation will
how him easily .the'party's nominee.
On the other hand Catts and his ad
herents claim that there is direct evi
dence of improper methods having
been used, and that they have affida
cits which purport to show that the
ballot boxes have been. tampered with
in at- least one county where recount
has been made, and in Knott's favor.
They claim that possession by Catts
of the certificate of nomination by the
democratic party after the county and
state canvassing boards ' had done
their work proves him to be the legal
and qualified nominee of .the party.

MILITARY NOTES

lows and Co, A misses them very
much, especially "Red" Perry and
"Piggie" Smith, who kept the young
"rookies" in good humor as they peel
ed spuds and cleaned pot for the "reg-
After losing 29 men on account of
not passing the' examinations, Co. A
has 121 good men left, making it the
strongest company in the Second -regiment,
also one of the best drilled.
Monday was innoculation day. Most
all the men received their third and
last treatment for the prevention of
typhoid fever. They received the
treatment at 2 o'clock and all were
able to go on regimental parade at
5:45 and made a creditable showing.
One of the largest crowds that ever
assembled at Black Point was out to
see the boys in "full dress." '.
We have the best cooks in camp:
"Doc" Melin, chief cook, and "Ned"
Anthony, first assistant, who are ar
tists when it comes to satisfying the
boys, having desert every day for dinr
ner, which is something unusual here
tofore. ' ' . ' "'
Corporal George Davis was in
charge of the rookies. We were ex
ceedingly sorry George failed on ac
count of one bad eye, as he was one
of the best in Co. A.
Tis better to have enlisted and fail
ed, than not to have enlisted at all.
Mr. Marsh, father of Lieut. Lester
Marsh, spent Sunday In camp. "

in camp today and will spend several
days with the boys. ,
