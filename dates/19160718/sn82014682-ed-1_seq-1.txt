That the dam of reservoir No. 4, in

Recommendations that observations
of flow of the various waters making

made are also contained in the re

that any effort to trace underground
flow by means of excavations, driven
wells, or other methods which would

Virulent Criticism of Lane
and Gregory Mr. Wilson
Assailed in Astonishing
Terms Promise of
Resignation
Made
President Wilson is referred to as "a champion of ieonaffe
by Circuit Judge T. B. Stuart, in the letter Judge Stuart left in
the White House a few weeks ago assailing Governor Pinkhara,
Secretary Lane and Attorney-General Gregory.
The Star-Bulletin publishes herewith a copy of Judge Stuart a
letter. Its text shows it to be even a mor flagrant attack on the
presidential and territorial administration than telegraphic reports
indicated:
WOODROW WILSON, President. ,
Dear Sir:
The Hawaiian Democratic Delegation that visited you was
elected at Primaries by a vote of about 2 to T over the Pinkhatn
rTicketalthoujgh ihe whole patronage of the Territory had been gived
o Pinkham by Mr. Lane. ' '"
' The first thought of the 'delegation was to bring before the
St. Louis Convention the conditions in Hawaii, but feeling such
action might be misunderstood, they concluded to .-wait and visit
you after the convention and lay before you their complaints, which
involved the, Interior and the Judiciary departments, they . are ijl
part as follows : . , . 4 UmZ? sl I
First: Appointments and Patronage " -'
With one or 'two . unimportant exceptions the ,entire . patronage
has been bestowed upon active opponentsof. the Democratic party."
The recommendations of the leading democrats and the Territorial
Committee, have, been, turned down in" all : instancea disregarded, - J :
Prominent among these instances are : . "'. ., '.,';! ' ! '
' (a) The naming of Mr. Pinkham, (sugar Republican
1 'and importer of peon-Ubor)" :aar ftDTnlrVe
McCandless, a strong Wilson Democrat; This 31r; Lane '
caused you to do. ; ''i i-V''' f lJ3:-:U'y
(b) The naming of Robertson (sugar Republican)
as Chief Jiwtice over Quarles, an administration Demo-;
crat of high 'character. This Mr.Gregory caused ybit - .
to do. . ; . . ; tj
(c) The naming of Wliitney (sugar Republican) " .
over Quinn, an administration Democrat, as Circuit '
Judge.: This also Mr. Gregory caused you to do. r. i ,
The above appointments have resulted in giving the'augar inter
ests the entire control and patronage of the executive and judiciary
departments of the Territory and depriving the Democratic party
of about 1000. positions in the public service ..." ';V;'-v
Second: Homesteads . yjf -r4
Mr. Pinkham, under the direction of Mr. Lane, has: contmnally
violated the acts of Congress as to Homesteads. . ,Ha has. openly
and viciously opposed the Democratic ticket in every election ; which
has also been done by Robertson and Whitney Besides- this Robert
son has adjudged the peon labor of the Territory, -under ; which
Whitney held a large number of citizens in jail aa' witnesries- to' be
constitutional. On the other hand your opponent, J tmice Hughes,
has adjudged a similar law unconstitutional.
Third: ; ; i . , ''V
The act of the Attorney-General in causing you to name Robert
son, places you in a position of a champion of peonage. The appoint
ment of Whitney reinforces the conclusion, and so does the prior
appointment of Pinkham. ' v v ' S -
Fourth:; -.. '. V? ;;,-5r
The appointment of Pinkham, and continuing him in position,
against the universal condemnation of homesteaders and the people
generally, places . you, Mr. President, in . the position of- the - worst
enemy the poor homesteaders have ever had. 7 v. s-- x
Fifth: " ' '"n"rrWt3
These matters were also talked over with Mr. Lane ""and Mr.
Gregory, each of whom, as if by previous arrangement," took up most
of the time in abusing the Democrats of Hawaii, who' sent you a
solid delegation. ' I1 iC'iC23
They claimed that the Democrats, of Hawaii Iwere . not only a
bad people, but very bad Both of these. good men declared their
inability to believe the statement of a Democrat from Hawaii. They
based this assertion not on their personal knowedge,' but on infonna
tion from Mr. Pinkham and one or two others whom ihej had ap
pointed and sent to Hawaii at the - instance of the Sugar Trust.
To be a little more specific, Mr. Gregory engaged: in vigorous
denunciation ; (upon the assumed truthfulness of his information)
of Democrats who were not under consideration at all; but did net
say one wcrd against Quarles cr Quinn who were under consideration
for the positions, to which he appointed Robertson and TThitney,
When the standing of Robertson and, Whitney on 'the peon law
was called to his attention, he was without excuse. .
Sixth: ' (. : --- :
Mr. Lane in conferencewith McCandless," Pachecb, hainnan of
the territorial "committee, and Wilson,' National Committeeman, said
that he ''would " not believe any Democrat ironi "Hawaii"; that it
was'the worst place he ever saw; that he believed the public land 3
of Hawaii, ought f 0 be sold at public auction," in; large tractsand if
purchase could ,not be made by the Hawaiian? he .would sell then
in San Francisco. - v ' '-' - '
' Mr. "Lane is of .foreign birth where dands are held in Iarc?
estates by titled lords and ; tilled by tenantry. How far does suca
i system influence his views and actions in reference, to pur land.,
all of which are now virtually subject to his control f
