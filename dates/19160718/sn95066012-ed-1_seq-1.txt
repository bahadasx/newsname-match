MAYOR GALE TRIES
10 EXPLAIN HIS
DIFFICULTY
Mayor of North Adams Accused of
Trading in City Offices
AND NOT PAYING HIS BILLS
Long Statement Made by the Mayor
in Which the Accuses John Ma
genis of Being Boss.
North Adams, July 18. North Ad
ams' disgraceful scandal In connec
tion with the mayor's ollice was par
tially aired in the local papers last
night when Mayor John W. Gale's
statement was printed:
His story of the last municipal
campaign, his dealings with Attorney
John B. Magenta before and after
the election, as wells as the history of
his estangement from Magenis, are
told In the interview which Mayor
dale released for publication last
evening. The substance of Mayor
(Sale's story is to the effect that he
was approached by Magenis soon ut
ter he had been nominated for mayor
by the democrats, and that lie had
been assured of support from Magenis
and his friends.
The mayor says that Magenis at
tills meeting old him he expected to
raise a campaign fund of about $18uii
ami that tiiis would be contributed by
the Conway brewing company of Troy
N. Y.. whom he is alleged to have said
was to give $80o. A man named
Casey at North Adams, whoso lirst
name was not mentioned, was put
down for $500 in the conversation,
and there! was talk that "the boys"
were, to bo asked to give $-," or
each if they could stand it.
dale's story is to the effect that
he promised to appoint former Mayor
P. I). Stafford license commissioner
in view of this promised support) and
in view of thu fact that lie thought
Stafford would make a good man for
the place. lie says he knows noth
ing about Whether or not any ol the
money referred to as a campaign
fund was raised or spent, and has
seen no evidence of it. He also said
that all the money he personally had
during tho campaign was something
like $77, which he accounted for in
his campaign expense statement.
Many conferences regarding ap
pointments other than that of license
commissioner are referred to In the
statement and Mayor dale says that
the trouble between him and .Magenis
started when It leaked out that he
had appointed lr. Stafford to the
license board before It had been in
tended to let the public know about
it. This brought about some public
criticism that lie did not like, the
mayor says, and he demanded, accord
Ing to his story, that Stafford re
turn to him the appointment that had
not yet been recorded. Dr. Stafford
had not qualified or taken the oath
of n ill en when this situation arose, he
said. This really started the trouble
neivvoon It i in and .Magenis, I In- mayor
says, and be stated that Magenis d
manded that Stafford lie announced
authoritatively as the appointee, dab
says he refused to do Ibis and later
appointed J elm P. Sullivan upon r
celvlng assurance- that hr. Stafford
would give up his claim to the up
polntment,
The feeling became acute between
them, dale says, when the matter of
reappointing City Bookkeeper Bulll
van came up for consideration. Ma

mayor or objecting to the renaming
of Sullivan and urging the appoint

Probate Judge B. c. Bennett, in the
absence of the state's attorney, ap
peared in the interests of the public
good and welfare.
Judge 1 1 olden made no effort to con
duct the proceedings according to the
rules of evidence. The judge did en
deavor to so restrain the parties and
the witnesses so that there would not
be more than six persons talking at
the same time, hilt in tills respect was
only partially successful.
As the litigants unburdened them
selves of their troubles the animosity
that was apparent when the proceed

There was evidence that some one
threw a pall of water on some one
else and that the holder of the pail
later used the utensil vigorously upon
the person who had received the con
tents butVtho allegation that a club
figured in the unneighborly gathering
was not substantiated, in the opinion
of the court.
No lines were imposed but the court
decided that the costs of the hearing
should be divided into three equal
parts and be paid by the three con
testants. When court adjourned George Davis
and Mr. Beaton shook hands and ex
pressed the hope that the residents of
the neighborhood would in the future
be able to live as neighbors should.

MOTION PICTURES IN BRAZIL
They Have Some Curious Rules In the
Theaters That Show Them.
South America is fast becoming a
paradise for the motion picture "tbe
uter, but some curious rules prevail.
For example, the best motion picture
theaters in Rio de Janeiro do not allow
patrons to drop in er out nt will. A
film Is advertised to begin at a certain
hour of the afternoon or evening. At
tiie appointed time doors are closed, or
in most cases a heavy mid highly
decorated curtain is dropped, and the
show In the auditorium begins its funo
tions. a rather novel arrangement, also
noted hi other Brazilian cities, is the
waiting lobby immediately in front of
the entrance proper. After purchasing
a ticket the patron enters the lobby or
corridor, takes a comfortable seal ami
waits until the termination of the Brat
section of the play, th" time of Which
may be a few minutes or half ait hour.
While waiting one may listen to the
band of music. Which mav be heard
equally well by (hose within the lob
by or in the audience.
At times the crowds become congest'
oti mid all the lobby seats are o copied.
In such discs the ticket seller with
holds further admlsatona. and the
crowd remains upon the street, but the
brilliant electric lights ftf night) and
the music of the bund continue to

K. C. M. !.. in uu urtlcle in Black
wood's Magazine:
"After Nazim Pasha became wall of
Bagdad there lived hi one of the best
bouses In the rtlaou an Armenian girl
of eighteen, who was very pretty! very
wealthy and an orphan. Ail the young
Armenians In the Turkish empire were
eager suitors for her hand, but she
WOOld have none of them. The Wall
invited her to bis palace and told her
that In her unprotected condition she
might get into trouble, but that If she
w ere to marry a count ryiuan of hers In
bis household she would have both a
sterling bQsband and his own protOC-
tion. She accepted, but on reaching
her home .-cut tiie nasim word that she
preferred remaining single.
"'You shall remain single for life!'
said the wall, and put a cordon of sol
diers round her house, which prevent
ed her from leaving It.
"She escaped to the French convent
one day. dressed as a French nun, and
tin? cordon of soldiers moved to her
new residence. After some delay she
escaped as a French monk, took refuge
on I.ynch's boat and sailed for Basra
iimler the Rritlsh flag. Boats full of
soldiers surrotgided the steamer ut
Basra, but the girl ran across the
deck, jumped into the Russian con
sul's boat and tool, refuge under the
Russian Qag, The consul saw her safe
ly mi to the British India Steamer, and
she descended m Bushlre, in Persia.
"Not many months afterward Nazim
Pasha himself was deposed ami order

turned there finally ami was, as we nil
know, murdered by the Young Turks"

Claim to Have Captured 13,000
Germans East of Stripa River
BRITISH ALSO GAIN A LiTTLE
Battle on Western Front Less Severe
Than Last Week But Allies Are
Still Pushing Forward.
The successes of the entente allies
are following each other with great
rapidity, said a dispatch from London
last night. Yesterday brought news
of further important gains for them
on both the western and eastern
front, arousing enthusiasm among
the British public baldly less than
that caused by the leceptioii of the
first news of tho allied offensive. The
dispatch of (Jen. Sir Douglas Halg yes
terday shows that the steady pressure
of the British arms is forcing an ever
deepening salient into the German
lines, and the commander-in-chief for
the first time produces evidence in
the shape of documents captured from
the Hermans, giving testimony as to
the high price the Germans are pay
Ing in casualties.
The Uritish have improved their
position along almost the whole of
their line of the battle front, captur
ing by assault 1600 yards of Herman
second-line positions north of tin
Basentinle-PetU wood, a strong Ger
man position at the Waterlot farm
between Umgueval and Guillemont
besides completing the capture of the
whole of the village of (Killers la
Bolsselle. These gains bring the
Itrlish almost to the crest of the Al
bert plateau, where stretches the Ger
man third line.
The news from the eastern front
yesterday was equally important. The
Russian commander, Gen. Kuropakin,
lias launched an oltensivo against
Field Marshal von 11 indenburg on
the Dvina river, and Gen von Lin
singvn's troops southwest of Lutsk
have been Compelled to retire behind
the Hps liver, while In the course of
Sunday's lighting In Yolhynhi the Rus
sians captured an additional 13.000
prisoners and ::u guns. Gen von
Llnsingen's retirement, according to
the I'etrograd military critics, repre
sents a great Russian tractual suc
cess. It was preceded by heavy
lighting, in Which the Russians
smashed the Teuton front on a width
of a mile and penertated several
miles into their positions.
The war Is now costing Great Brit
ain Lt;.'iim.iiiMi daily, but with such
news as the successes of the entente
allies this sacrifice is nowhere
grudged, While the powers of Sndur
