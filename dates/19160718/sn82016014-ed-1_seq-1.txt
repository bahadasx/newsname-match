Hundreds of shots were exchanged
betwr-en the crazed man, barricaded
in his flat in a two story brick struc
ture at 320 North Irving avenue, and
the police. The latter made an inef
fectual attempt to burn the place and
exploded three charges of dynamite
under it as they were unable to make

curate fire of the negro.

Note Explains Fanaticism.
The explosion blew the rear porch
and part of the kitchen into the alley,
and when the police were able to en
ter the building it was a wreck. They
found an explanation of Mclntyre's
deed in a note which he left scrawled
in lead pencil on a soiled piece of
brown wrapping paper.
"The Almighty God has made
me a prophet unto all nations and
also my wife, Mattie Mclntyre,"
ran the note. "You shall know
that the Lord has sent me to
gather unto the Lord the rem
nant of the Adamic Seed." (At
this place in the scrawl the negro
wrote three capital "C." and the
initials "P. H.")
"The Lord has made me the
savior of all Africans of Amer
ica and now I shall recommend
all that are worthy unto my
heavenly father, the great God of
all creation. The Lord has given
me a spirit to judge the quick and
the dead.
"I must die in this land that I
may carry my reports unto Al
mighty God concerning the land
of the United States."
In the opinion of Police Captain
Wesley Westbrook, Mclntyre wrote
the letter just before becoming vio
lent, although he had opportunity to
do so during lulls in the fighting.
Shoots Policeman Dead.
Frank Freemuth, a policeman, told
this story of the fight:
"Stuart Dean was shot when he en
tered the building after breaking down
a rear door. I and four other police
men were with him, but he was, the
first to enter. He was shot and killed
the instant he crossed the threshold.
Clement and Crabtree were shot when
they entered to recover Dean's body.
Uoth fell, and we had to go in and get
the three of them.
"The crazy negro was barricaded
behind a trunk and other articles when
we came in. He had a rifle and a re
volver and fired rapidly."
Mrs. Knox gave this version:
"I was awakened about 5 o'clock by
shouts and screams," she said. "I
awakened my husband and we found
that the screams came from a woman
at Mclntyre's home. We went out on
our porch, my husband in front, and
at that moment a bullet struck him
and he fell dead. I started back into
the house to warn my niece who was
still in bed.
"That's the last I remember but I
know that a bullet got me in the
back "
Thought Mclntyre Queer.
Mrs. Knox said that neighbors for
some months had considered Mcln
tyre queer ana did not associate with
him. His actions at times became so
strange that the police were called,
but his offenses were not considered
serious enough to warrant arrest.
Mclntyre first attracted attention at
3:16 o'clock in the morning by. his
shouts, but it was not until 5 that the
noise became so alarming that the
neighbors came out to investigate and
-alls were sent to the Warren Ave
nue police station. .

Representatives of the gas company
fmin Pennsylvania. Texas ana oiner
states attended the conference. They
represented a majority or xne siock.
The conference was behind closed
doors.
$2,000,000 for Gas.
Immediate expenditure of $2,000,
000 for gas was promised by the
stockholders. They proposed the use
of $1,250,000 of the funds from stock
sales for new gas. This sum, with
$760,000 which the receiver has been
directed to spend, would meet the $2,
000,000 requirement Representatives
of the company also proposed the ex
penditure of the company's 1917-1 3
earnings in the extension of the com
pany's property and the securing of
more gas for Kansas and Missouri
consumers.
Gas supply and pressure sufficient
to tax the capacity of the company's
present pipe lines was proposed by
the stockholders for next winter. Ad
ditional pipe lines have been arranged
for. It was asserted that $300,000
worth of new pipe lines are now being
laid. Other lines will be laid and new
gas fields tapped as soona s new funds
are available.
Ready to Take the Stock.
In the handling of the new issue, it
was asserted that the new stock would
be taken up by the present stockhold
ers of the company. One report today
was to the effect that R. A. Long, one
of the heavy stockholders at this time,
would probably take $400,000 or $500,
000 worth of the new issue.
Plans as outlined today mean the
sale of $4,500,000 worth of stock and
the use of the additional $7 50,000 by
the receiver as well as expenditure of
two years' earnings. From the $4,
500,000 stock issue, the company pro
poses to take up the outstanding bond
issue amounting to $3,300,000. Un
der this program the receivership
would be dissolved and the company
reorganized as a going concern free
from court supervision.
MASTER OF OCEAN
V. S. Government Gives Up
Hunt for Deadly Sharks
Living Submarines Are
Numerous on Coast.
Too
New York, July 18. Sharks are
the undisputed masters of the Atlantic
coast. The federal government today
abandoned its proposed campaign of
extermination by the coast guard
along the New Jersey beaches.
The enemy were simply too numer
ous. The government's marine ex
perts acknowledge that the coast is in
a state of blockade by living subma
rines. Bathers must look out for their own
safety. Torpedo net barriers are be
ing installed wherever there are
bathing houses on ocean cr bay.
feanwhile, captains of arriving
steamships report the Atlantic alive
with a veritable plague of sharks and
several were caught along the coast.
The largest specimen to he captured
since the scare began was a fifteen
foot hammerhead shark hooked by
the sailors of the battleship Texas
while on her wav to Newnort.
Long Island sound has been invad
ed and three sharks of man-eating
size were harpooned and brought
asnore near a crowd of bathers at
Greer.port. L. I., today.
Two baby sharks were seen today in
Matawan creek. New Jersey, where
two persons lost their lives Wednes
day. By wey of diversion from the shark
scare, a school of fifteen whales
spouted and frolicked off Sayville to
day. PREDICTS THUNDERSTORM

Connor, weather forecaster, has a
cheering prediction for Kansas City
more thunderstorms in sight.
They may not come until late tonight

FAR MORE GRAVE
SAYSCRUMBINE
Secretary State Board Health
Alarmed Over Epidemics.
Typhoid, Tuberculosis Worry
Him More Than Paralysis.
ARE FORTY-THREE NEW CASES
Nineteen Additional Reports of
Consumption In State.
Measles and Whooping Cough
Come in for Attention.
While Kansas Is worrying herself
sick because of an epidemic of infan
tile paralysis that threatens the state,
numerous other epidemics are being
overlooked. That was the report from
the state board of health today when
reports of several hundred cases of
typhoid fever, scarlet fever, tubercu
losis, measles and whooping cough
were sent to Dr. S. J. Crumbine, secre
tary of the state board.
Reports now being received by the
state board and covering cases other
than infantile paralysis furnish a
situation far more serious, in a local
way, than the baby disease. It is
probable that the reports which are
finding their way to the state board
will result in several special bulletins
covering typhoid prevention and a
fight against other diseases.
Reports for one day showed but a
single new case of infantile paralysis
in Kansas. On that same day, how
ever, the state board of health re
ceived reports of forty-three new cases
of typhoid fever. The reports also
told of nineteen new cases of tubercu
losis. Ill cases of measles, fifty-six
cases of whooping cough and twenty
cases of scarlet fever.
State Overlooks It.
"It is all right for people to show
concern regarding the spread of in
fantile paralysis," said Dr. Crumbine,
"but the state is overlooking a condi
tion that is far more grave. The in
crease in the number of cases of ty
phoid and tuberculosis should imme
diately attract attention to health con
ditions in every portion of the state."
A large majority of the new cases
of typhoid fever were reported from
southern Kansas the district com
prising Sedgwick, Sumner, Cowley,
Wilson and Montgomery counties. Six
new cases of typhoid were reported in
one day from Wichita, while ten new
cases were found in Sumner county,
three in Wilson county, two in Cowley
county and three in Montgomery coun
ty. A report of two cases came from
Chase county. Shawnee county re
ported one case.
Just one new case of infantile pa
ralysis has been found In Kansas
since Saturday. This report came
from Salina. Specialists under direc
tion of the state board ' have been
placed in charge of all cases in the
state.
SEE R-J CRISIS
Appeal to President to Delay
Anti-Trust Act.
Menaced by Threatened Strike
and Government Curb.
Washington, July 18. Personal ap
peal to President Wilson for assistance
In what they term a "business crisis"
will be made by representatives of
the big railroads. Confronted on the
one hand by provisions of the Clayton
anti-trust act, which they claim are
hazy and complicated, and on the
other by the threat of 300,000 railway
workers to strike unless granted short
er hours and more pay, railroad offi
cials declare their situation is serious.
The president will be asked in the
first place to suggest a delay in the
effective date of the Clayton act's pro
vision, which governs the purchase of
supplies by the roads, until the rail
road officials and the interstate com
merce commission "have had oppor
tunity to study it." This is to go into
effect In a few weeks unless congress
by resolution delays it.
Employes Take Strike Vote.
The four great trainmen brother
hoods are voting on whether or not to
strike. Some administration officials
say a strike which would tie up the
railroads of the country at this time
would be a calamity. It is likely the
railroad officials, when they see the
president tomorrow, will take up this
qustion along with the other. They
desire either that their men submit
their claims to arbitration or an in
vestigation of railroad wages by the
interstate commerce commission or
by a congressional committee.
PARRY ON KANSAS COAL
Conference Makes Headway, But Can't
Agree on Osage County Mines.
Kansas City, July 18. Coal opera
tors and miners, conferring here on a
two-year wage contract for the 35.000
! coal miners of Missouri, Arkansas. Ok
lahoma and Kansas, agreed today
upon two or three wage increase
contentions. They are for an increase
of three cents a ton on mine run coal
and a five per cent, increase in yard
and deadwork.
The conferees have been unable to
agree upon the wage for thin-grained
pick-mined coal in Missouri and Osage
county, Kansas.
The miners asked for an increase of
j five cents a ton. The operators agreed

MISS WILSON OUT
Head of Beloit Industrial
School for Girls Resigns. .
She Has Been a Storm Center
for a Long Time.
CHARGES MADE AGAINST HER
Resulted in an Investigation of
Her Administration.
She Will Retire From
School September 1.
the
Resignation of Miss Frankie Wilson,
superintendent of the State Industrial
School for Girls, Belpit, was today an
nounced by Governor Capper. The
resignation was forwarded to the state
board of corrections, which is in ses
sion at the school. Miss Wilson will
leave Beloit September 1. She may
teach school.
The resignation of Miss Wilson fol
lows more than three years of storm
at Beloit. Apparently, unable to pre
serve harmony, she was constantly on
one end of numerous rows that started
in the Mitchell county town. Her ad
ministration was frequently criticised
and as a result of these complaints
charges were sent to the governor and
to the state board of corrections,
which has supervision over the insti
tution. Following a recent storm at Rfilnit
Governor Capper appointed a commit
tee to investigate conditions. This
committee was composed of women.
An official report has never been filed
although Governor Capper was recent
ly aavisea that Miss Wilson had been
exonerated so far as the more serious
charges were concerned. The investi
gation, however, divulged the use of
the straight-jacket and a practice of
shaving the heads of girls who vlo-
ruies. Lack of diplomacy in
meeting local conditions, was the

CRY PACIFIC DANGER
West Coast Senators Defeated in De

Washington, July 18.- Pacific coast
senators today were defeated 18 to
48 in an attempt to provide by amend
ment to the general naval bill that
three of the proposed capital ships be
maintained permanently on the Pa
cific coast.
Senators Works, Phelan and Jones
made emphatic speeches for proposal
of which Works was author. Senators
Swanson and Lodge, principal sup
porters of the administration pro
gram, insisted that Works's proposi
tion was an infringement of the con
stitutional powers of the president as
commander-in-chief of the army and
navy. All three coast speakers point
ed out that there is now no first class
battelship on the Pacific coast despite
threatened danger from Japan.
"The next battle the United States
fleet may fight," said Senator Phelan,
"may be in the Pacific ocean. If so
the United States has not a single first
class vessel for its fighting line."
Senators voting for the proposal
were:
Chamberlain, Clapp, Cummins. Ash

Poindexter Smith (Arizona) Smoot,

St. Paul, Minn., July 18. Prohibi
tionists who came to St. Paul one day
in advance of the opening of their
national convention hoped against
hope today that their merger with the
dry elements of other parties could be
accomplished. Up to the opening of
the' "get together conference" today,
at which scores of prominent Bull
Moose, dry Democrats and dry Repub
licans had been expected, there were
only a handful of other party repre
sentatives here.
National Chairman Hinshaw and
other Prohibition leaders sought to
round up all the Bull Moose in sight
and found one. Col. J. M. Ingersoll of
Idaho, Progressive national commit
teeman from his state, who is strongly
in favor of merging the Bull Moose
with the Prohibitionists.
Parker Sidesteps Too.
Col. John M. Parker of Louisiana,
Progressive nominee for vice presi
dent, was reported today to have
turned the same kind of a cold shoul
der toward the drys as did Henry
Ford. Telegrams from New Orleans
today indicated that Parker had re
fused under any circumstances to be
a prohibition candidate for vice presi
dent. At the get together conference
oratory was to be free and unlimited.
Delegates, including hundred of wom
en who had spent sleepless nights in
hot Pullmans found St. Paul just as
hot when they arrived and planned to
take plenty of fans to the convention
hall.
Disappointment at failure of other
party chieftains to arrive was echoed
early today in statements by some pro
hibitionists that they would fight any
move to change the name of the
party.
Why Change Name?
"If we can't adopt the Bull Moose
orphan what's the use of changing our
name to the progressive-prohibition
party?" was their line of reasoning.

Capital City After Big Federal

Commercial Club Seeks One of
Twelve U. S. Institutions.
SHOW IMPORTANCE OF STATE
Committee Ready to Prove
That Kansas Is Worthy.
S. . Cobb Named to Head the
Boosting Committee.
Twenty-four hours after President
Wilson signed the land loan bank bill,
the board of directors of the Topeka
Commercial club began a fight for
landing one of the twelve government
banks in Topeka. Already J. Will
Kelley, secretary of the Commercial
club, has sent telegrams .to Kansas
senators and representatives, urging
them to use all their influence in
landing one of the big banks.
John S. Dean this afternoon tele
phoned to Charles K. Lobdell. presi
dent of the First National bank at
Great Bend and a candidate for ap
pointment on the farm loan board, in
viting him to come to Topeka and
listen to Topeka's arguments for the
placing of a land loan bank in To
peka. Mr. Lobdell is expected to ar
rive here in a few days.
Cobb Heads Committee.
S. E. Cobb, vice president of the
Bank of Topeka and an enthusiastic
booster for the big bank in Topeka,
was elected by the board of directors
as chairman of a committee which
will begin immediately to prepare
data showing Topeka's accessibility
to agricultural activities in this .sec
tion of the Missouri valley. It is con
sidered probable that Kansas, Okla
homa, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska
will comprise one of twelve regions
for the installation of a farm loan
ban k. .
George Godfrey Moore of the Ger
mania Life Insurance company, stat
ed that the importance of Kansas as
a center for loaning money on farm
mortgages was realized by life insur
ance companies. These companies
have loaned more than eO,OOC,000
on farms in Kansas. This just in
cludes the companies operating under
the New York law.
He Can Prove It.
Mr. Cobb has little fear that he will
fail to prove Topeka the logical loca
tion for the bank but he, as well as
other members of the board of direc
tors, fears the injection of politics
into the selection of a bank.
It is understood that Omaha is be
ginning to pull strings for the bank.
Omaha is represented by Gilbert M.
Hitchcock, one of the strongest Demo
crat senators in the Missouri valley.
Since Bryan has lost his influence
with the administration crowd, Hitch
cock is the man to whom Wilson ad
herents look to overcome tne anti-aa-ministratlon
feeling engendered
through Wilson's treatment of . the
Commoner. However, Omaha is not
looked upon as the logical center or a
region including Oklahoma, Kansas,
Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska. Nor
will Lincoln, Omaha's rival, look with
favor upon Omaha's getting the bank.
Dean Outlines Plan,
a. Dean outlined to the directors
the method which will be pursued in
operating the bank. Topeka should
not only get the bank but the gov
ernment registrar's office, Mr. Dean
declared. In this office will be main
tained the records on all mortgages
and data of all descriptions neces
sarily arising as a result of the main
tenance of such a bank. Then, at
torneys must be employed to examine
mortgages ana oioer leg nutuis vi
the bank.
Before leaving the Commercial club
this noon, Mr. Cobb exprersed his de
termination to begin immediately the
accumulation of facts and figures to
present to the board immediately af
ter its formation, if the data should
be desired. The board will be com
prised of two Republicans, two Demo
crats and the secretary of the treas-

Rumor That He'll Be Governor
Federal Reserve.
Chas. H. Hamlin Urged to Run
Race in Massachusetts.
Washington, July 18. Official cir
cles were interested in a report here
that Secretary of the Treasury Mc
Adoo is to resign from the cabinet to
accept an appointment as governor of
the federal reserve board, succeeding
Charles H. Hamlin. Governor Ham
lin was out of the city. It was im
possible, therefore, to obtain official
verification of the report. The term
cf Hamlin expires August 1. His suc
cessor will be given a term of ten
years.
Members of the federal reserve
board receive the same salary as cab
inet officers $12,000 a year. The of
fice is one of the most sought and most
highly prized in the gift of the govern
ment. Governor Hamlin has been urged re"
peatedly to retire from the reserve
board and make the race as Demo
cratic candidate for governor cf Mass-
I achusetts. Secretary McAdoo, who is
the president's son-in-law, was at the
White House today in conference with
the president. Postmaster General
Burleson, who, with Mr. McAdoo, is
the closest political adviser, also was
at the White House. The White House
was silent today on the reported cabi
net change.
The Other Side or It.
Washington, July 18. Charles S.
Hamlin, governor of the federal re
serve board will be renominated as a
member of the board when his term
expires next month. Administration
officials allowed this to become known
today by way of denial of reports that
Secretary McAdoo would quit the cab
inet to take Governor Hamlin's place.
Mr. Hamlin will be renominated for a
iten year term. Whether he will be
redesignated as chairman . lies with
President Wilson.

Hires a Stenographer. .,
Then he hired a stenographer. Miss
Ellen Christy, 722 Western avenue,
and put her to work writing price lists,
contracts and other things that go
with a well managed wholesale gro
cery store. The contracts were to the
effect that the "Consolidated Whole
sale Grocery company of Oklahoma"
was to furnish all groceries to whom
ever wanted them.
Then he dropped into the store of
Tom Handy, Fourth and Qutncy
streets, and confided his intentions of
opening a water service plant for the
Union. Pacific here thereby bringing
thirty men and their families to the
city. Handy endorsed a check, Kiene
says, for $50 and identified Crump in
a bank here for a $480 check. How
ever, the bank merely took the
$480 check for collection. Crump
claimed he had $500 on deposit in a
Muskogee bank. Also his checks were
stamped with a certified stamp which
Kiene claims he wielded himself.
Catches Another VicrfJm.
Robert Gathers, Fourth and Lake
streets, cashed one of Crump's checks
for $25 after Crump had purchased
$9 worth of groceries. The groceries
were nauled to tne vacant house on
701 Lawrence street, which Crump
had rented for a relative who was to
be connected with his business activi
ties here.
Crump also hired a boy, Kenneth
Hamilton, 102 Western avenue, to
drive him around in a buggy. Crump
and the boy started for Law re n ce
that's what Crump told the boy and Ms
parents Sunday, but ended their trip
in St. Joe. Crump's one decent act
in his career; officials say, was to
place the boy in a good hotel over
Sunday and send him home the next
day, Monday.
Crump, the sheriff says, tried te
pass worthless checks on a number of
other grocers here, but failed with
some of them. Kiene says he does not
know how many Topekans Crump vic
timized, but hints they are many.
After Crump rented the store build
ing in North Topeka he hired an of
fice manager, messenger boys and
other help. He assumed a prosperous
attitude and carried ail the ear marks
of a man making a flier for fortune ia
a legitimate and forceful way.
When those employes arrived in
North Topeka to go to work today
Crump was somewhere else.

Retreat In Volynia Nets Slavs Them
sands Prisoners.
Petrograd, July 18. The Ormani
have retreated nearly ten miles In
Volynia under the swift advance of
General Kaledln's left wing
In their hasty retirement, several
thousand more prisoners, a number of
heavy suns and large supplies of war
material have fallen into the hands
of the Russians The retreat was made
necessary when several Russian regi
ments broke through the German
front and threatened to surround a
part of General von Linsingen's
army.
The Russians have advanced their
lines to the north bank of the river
Lipa, and are strengthening their
new positions on the entire front.
The advance widens the Russian
salient extending into the Austro
German front southeast of Kovel,
thus removing the danger of crushing
enemy attacks on both sides of ths
Russian wedge.
Against Reinforced Austrian.
All along the eastern front, the
czar's armies have suddenly resumed
the initiative. The Russian left wins;
in southern Bukowina is again in
motion against the reinforced Aus
trian army. The infantry combats
are becoming more frequent InGalicia
and both artillery and infantry ac
tivity are reported on General
Kuropatkin's front in the Dvinsfr
Riga region on the north. The Rus
sian commanders on the Austro
German front, however, are com
pelled to share public interest with
the Grand Duke Nicholas, whose new
offensive Sn the Caucasus continues
to make progress.
