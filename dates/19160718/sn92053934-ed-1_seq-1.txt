Atlanta, Ga July IS. As North
Carolina floods slowly receded today,
the situation in South Carolina grew
serious. High waters were sweeping
down from the mountain regions,
many streams were out of their banks
and the state was threatened by the
most destructible floods in its history.
The death list from high waters in
five southeastern states today stood
at la, with 13 or more missing. The
property loss was put at 15. 000,000.
Rescue parties searcher! the swollen
Catafaba river all night near Bel
mont, N. C, for ten construction men
who went down with the Southern
railway bridge there Sunday.
While the situation was greatly im
proved in the region around Asheville
and Biltmore, where six persons lost
their lives, reports from other districts
showed damage far in excess of that
first reported. Three million dollars
damage was done to property in Yad
kin county, North Carolina.
Flooded power plants in the inun
dated area have caused great loss to
textile and other industries. In Char
lotte alone one million cotton spindles
were made idle.
No street cars are operating in that
city.
Rivers in east Tennessee today were
at their highest stages in 14 years and
rising.
Greatly improved conditions are re
ported in Virginia and West Virginia.
Streams are falling and normal con

Railroad officials believe it will be
several weeks before normal train
schedules are restored.
SUB EXPECTED TO
DEPART ANY TIME
German Indersea Craft Finishing
Loading- of Canro Heady to Sail
Leading Guarded.
Baltimore, July IS. That the Ger
man merchant submarine Deutsr liland
would finish loading her cargo bv to
night and he ready to leave within a
few hours was the belief here today.
It was recalled today that Captain
Paul Koenig had stated to customs
oitieials when he entered his arrival
at the customs house that he thought
he would sail on his return voyage
within ten days. That perio dis up.
The captain had not applied for his
clearance papers at the ( ustoni house
up to noori today, however. Captain
Koenig smilingly refuses to say when
he will depart.
Washington, July IS. The allied
embassies here expect the German
underwater line Heutschland to start
on iier voyage back to Germany at
any hour probably within the next
day or two. It was made clear today
I hat the embassies, while these have
made reports on the character of the
submarine, have made no protest and
probably will make no further move
until after sh. has sailed, then some
sort of representations will be filed
with the state department to serve hs
a rrcoril in case the Peutschland
(should do any damage to allied ship
i ping.
j Agents of the allied governments
'have expressed concern over the prox
lirnity of the German liner Neckar. The
j Neckar has Been alongside the
I louTschland at her w harf. The asents
reported having heard that Captain
Paul Koenig of the Heutschland had
once been the second officer of the
Neckar and have pointed out to the
embassies that the correspondence of
Captain FYanz von Papen, the with
drawn military attache of the Ger
man embassy mentioned a Paul
Koenig in connection with the plots
to destroy the Wetland canal.
Opinion prevails among naval men
and at the allied embassies that the
chances of getting away are much in
the submarine's favor.

Deny Appeal
of Sentence
to Casement
London, July IS, (12:23 p. m.) The
appeal of Sir Roger Casement against
his sentence of execution for high
treason for his activities in the Dublin
revolt was dismissed by the court of
criminal appeal.
For a day and a half Alexander Sul
liv.akPy Sir Roger's counsel, ansuid. be
fore the court, quoting many authori
ties in favor of his contention that the
offense of treason depended upon
whether the accused dwelt under the
protection of the king and that the
crime could not be committed without
the realm.
Justice Darling, in delivering the
judgment expressed the indebtedness
of the court to Mr. Sullivan for his
arguments but he declared that they
had been answered by the attorneys
of the crown at the first trial.
A further appeal to the house of
lords is possible only if the attorney
general gives a certificate that the de
cision of the court of criminal appeal
involves a point of law so exceptional,
ly important that it is desirable in the
public interest that a still higher court
should deal with it. This has been
done only twice since the court of
criminal appeal was established eight
years ago.
Attorney Michael Francis Doyle of
Philadelphia, of counsel for Sir Roger
said it was improbable the attorney
general would certify the case for ap
peal to the house of lords, as the ap
peal court did not consider it neces
sary to hear argument lor the gov
ernment. Powerful influences are working for
a reprieve, said the attorney, and there
were strong hopes of one being
Krantcd.

present at today's conference,
j Whether the commission will be
authorized to discuss in addition to
jthe border situation, economic and

Chicago. July IS. II. J. Mclntyre. a
colored religious fanatic, becoming
violently insane today killed four per
sons and wounded three with a rifio
before the police, whom he held at bay
for an hour or more, killed him and
his wife.
Mclntyre's wife is supposed to havo
assisted him at least to the extent of
reloading his weapons, as a cartridge
belt was found around her waist sim
ilar to the one worn by her husband.
In all Mclntyre's hallucination that
he must "carry my report to the Al
mighty" cost six lives.
Hundreds of shots were exchanged
between the crazed man, barricaded in
his fiat in a two-story brick structure
at 320 North Irving avenue, and the
police. The latter made an ineffectual
attempt to burn the. place and exploded
three charges of dynamite under it. aa
they were unable to make headway
against the rapid and accurate tire ol
the negro.

Tho explosions blew the rear porch

found an explanation of Mclntyre's
deed which he scrawled in lead pen

ping paper.
"The Almighty God has made me a
prophet unto all nations and also my
wife, Hattio Mclntyre," ran the note.
"You shall know that the Ixird has
sent me to gather unto the Lord the
remnant of the Adamic seed."
t (At this place in tho scrawl the
negro wrote three capital C's and the
initials "P. H."l
"The Lord has made mo the savior

tho latter Just before becoming vio

do so between lulls while the blue
coats, having been repulsed, were un

Policeman Tells Story.
Frank Froemuth, a policeman, told
this story:
"Stuart Dean was phot when be en
tered the building after breaking down
a rear door. I and four other police
men were with him but he was the
first to enter. He was shot and killed
the instant that he crossed the thres
hold. Cle ment and Orabtree wore shot
when they entered to recover Dean's
body. Both fell and we had to go in
and get the three of them.
"The crazy negro was barricaded
behind a trunk and fMher articles when
we came in. He had a rifle and a re
volver and tired so fast and we fired
so f;tst, that I couldn't count them.
In fact I didn't try to."
Woman Gives Version.
Mrs. Knox gave this version:
"I was awakened about ." o'clock by

that tin screams came from a womar"
at Me Intyre's home. We went out oi.
our porch, my husband in front, and
