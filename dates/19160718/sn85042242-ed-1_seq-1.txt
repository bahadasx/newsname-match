KH.LED IN
Fargo, July 17.—Olga Draxten, age
17, an employe of the Herbst Depart­
ment store, was killed, and five other
occupants of William Johnson's auto­
mobile were hurt when the machine
hurtled over an embankment a mile
and a half west of Hawley, Minn.,
about 11 o'clock last night.
The machine turned completely
over twice, landing on its wheels,
with Johnson still at his post.
Just a week ago yesterday, Miss
Draxten was saved from drowning in
the Red river. With a sister and sev­
eral others, she was bathing in the
Island park floods and had gone down
twice before she was rescued by a
sister and a party in a canoe.
MERCURY GOES BACK TO
90 AFTER ONE DAY OP
NEEDED RELIEF AT 86
Where it has been practically
every day in July, the mercury
yesterday rested, 90 degrees in
the shade.
The morning storm did not
seem to ceol the atmosphere one
particle. In fact, the humidity
occasioned by it made the heat
more oppressive than on the days
when the thermometer register­
ed 93.
A long line-up waited for tables
at all the soda fountains.
The only people that didn't
seem to feel the heat were, the
youngsters at the circus.
Sunday's maximum was 86.
BLISS TO PROBE
Because of severe criticism directed
at the war department relative to mo­
bilization of the rational guard
throughout the country, Gen. Bliss
has been ordered to the Mexican bor­
der to make a thorough investigation
of all conditions there. He will also
report on the treatment the militia­
men received enroute.

LITTLE EXCITEMENT
AMONG CIVILIANS
The boys at Camp Lincoln were
assigned yesterday to their cars,
but no orders were received to
entrain. It is rumored that they
will go to Liano Grande or San
Antonio, Texas, when they leave
•here.
Civilian Mexicans along the further
side of the Rio Grande are suffering
for. want of food, declare porters who
are here with the cars that will carry
the boys of the North Dakota regi­
ment south. They come direct from
the front to Bismarck, having carried
the Maine militia to the trouble zone.
They declare that many of the
United States soldiers are sharing
their rations with the starving south­
erners. This condition of the civil­
ians is one that, they believe, has
done much to encourage raiding.
Nobody Afraid.
None of the Americans in the bor­
der states is afraid, they declare, and
the Mexicans who reside in cities on
this side of the Rio Grande are prov­
ing loyal to this country. There is
not as much excitement down there
as there is north, since the militia
has afrived and a long line of troops
has been planted so as to command
every foot of the border.
Travel De Luxe.
Most of the militia boys are travel­
ing de luxe and with ample rations.
The porters declare that they are
speaking from experience, because
the boys often share their food with
them.
The soldiers stand in well with
George. He says that they are lib­
eral tippers, that is, if pay day has
not been too far in the distant past.
All of the boys on the border are
in the best of spirits, but it is hot.
The nights, however, say the porters,
are cool and restful.
MINN. BANKS NUMBER 1,282.
St. Paul, Minn., July 17.—State

banks, make a total of 1,282 banking
institutions in the state.
Villistas Evade U.S.
Troops and Another
Attack Is Expected
Chihuahua City, July 17.—Several
scattered groups of Villistas have
eluded the cordon of government
troops which surrounded them in the
lower Florida bottoms, and have re­
assembled at Tinajas and Las Esco
bas, on the road to Ojanaga, with the
object of making another raid on the
American border, according to confi­
dential advices to General Trevino to­
day.
The advices which came from San­
ta RQsalio said the -outlaws skirted
Chihuahua City by traveling in small
groups to the little settlement north­
east of here.
General Trevino immediately order­
ed the commander of the garrisons
at Ojanaga and Piedras Nedras to
throw troops out in an attempt to in­
tercept the bandits, whose numbers
were estimated at 200. He point­
ed out that the nature of the terri­
tory is such that some of the oulaws
PREPAREDNESS
Washington, July 17.—Discussion
of the naval building program in the
senate today brought out impressions
that the committee order the con­
struction of 16 capital warships with­
in three years, eight of them in 1917,
probably ^hould be approved without
amendment. 'Administration leaders
hoped tonight to pass the bill tomor­
row. Both Republican and Democrat­
ic lead.fffi, favored it, however, and an
amendment, .by Senator iNorris to de­
lay construction of any of the 16
ship's until after the close of the Eur­
opean war and after failure of efforts
to create an international peace tri­
bunal was tabled 45 to 11.
In support of his amendment Sen­
ator Morris declared the bill provided
for expenditure of more money for
naval construction in time of peace
than was ever spent by any nation in
the world, despite the fact that "it is
very probable that before the Euro­
pean war is over, the United States,
without construction of a single ship,
will have the greatest navy In the
world." .,iVJ
Calls It Hysteria.
Senior Vardamann declared con­
gress was yielding to hysteria, and
cautioned against expenditures of
such vast sums for armament until
the country's cool, normal judgment
could be consulted.
Senator Thomas opposed the con­
struction of so many big ships and
urged that submarines and aircrafts
would be sufficient protection for a'
nation, which does not contemplate
offensive warfare. Senator Works
predicted that the passage of the na
val bill would mark a change in the
military policy that would overrun
the peaceful spirit of America.
Urges Preparedness.
Senators Lewis (Democrat) and
Borah, Weeks and Kenyon (Republi­
cans) spoke in favor of the measure.
Senator Borah urged that if the Unit­
ed States was to enjoy the blessings
of peace, it must convince the world
it is prepared for war.
In declaring that the United States
has not a friend among the nations,
Senator Lewis pleaded that the peo­
ple be told the frank truth about for­
eign relations, so they would demand
an adequate navy. He pointed to Ja­
pan's entrance into the present war
for the purpose of ousting Germany
from the Par East, and inquired if
anyone believed that "she would not
enforce against America what she en­
forced against Germany and call up­
on her present allies to help her in a
war against the United tSates."

Absolute Secrecy
Is
Maintained
as to 'Possible Move­
ment.
Baltimore, July 17.—There were
many indications tonight that, the sub­
marine merchantman, Deutschland,
will be ready to sail tomorrow.
The tug, Thomas F,. Timmons,
which towed the submersible to Balti­
more, from the capes, coaled this af­
ternoon. Captain 1\ Ilinscto of the in­
terned North German-Llttyd steamer,
Neckar, which had charge .of the Tim­
mons when she picked up the
Deutschland, was seen on hoard when
she was taking coal.
Crew is Puzzled.
Several colored workers, answering
questions as to how their work was
going, said they expected to finish
loading by 11 o'clock tomorrow. They
were pulled away from the question­
ers and cautioned to stop talking.
The day force was relieved by a night
shift at 5:30 p. m. Shortly before 5
o'clock this afternoon, Theodore,
foreman of the grand jury, accompan­
ied by the marshal of police, came
to the pier where the Deutschland is
berthed arid was permitted to view
the submarine from the deck of the
l^eckar.
Captain Hinsch said he regretted he
could not issue a pass to go aboard
•the Deutschland, but it had been de­
cided not to allow my more visiting.
Nickel on Board.
Officials of the E,intern Forwarding
company
concerning
land
the cargo had progressed. It is known,
however, that a quantity of nickel,
which will do duty as ballast, as well
as form part of the cargo, has been
taken aboard. Most of the rubber that
is to be taken is thought to be in
the vessel's hold.
Puts on War Paint.
The painting of the Deutschland's
hull' so that it harmonizes with the
waters of the Atlantic even to tlv
whitecaps has been completed. To
night the tug, Timmons, and the
launch, Efco, are patroling the river
in the vicinity of the submarine and
playing their searchlights in all direc­
tions. Vessels that approach too near
the pier are warned off.
Ashore there is a constant patrcl
of policemen and special watchmen of
the Eastern Forwarding company,
who keep all persons at a distance of
several hundred yards from the sub­
marine and permit no loitering,

Thirteen Dead and Property

Raleigh, N. C., July 17.—'Thirteen
persons dead, at least ten missing,
and property damage estimated at
around
$15,000.(100
is the known toll
of floods in five southern states in
the past 48 hours.
Although the waters are receding
in nearly all districts, railroad and
telegraph communications are still, de­
moralized, and reports from towns
and villages now isolated may in
crease both the number of dead and
the property loss.

FEDERAL JUDGE CLARKE, APPOINTED
NEW SUPREIE COURT JUSTICE
tlUDGE tJOHN CLARKE
Cleveland, O., July 17.—Ifohn H. Clarke of Cleveland, the new justice
of the United States supreme court, is a former railroad attorney. Three
events in his career are of interest:
First—As federal district judge he ordered the car shops of the Wheel­
ing & Lake Erie railroad at Brewster, O.. reopened when the road's re­
ceiver closed them to cut expenses. This saved a town's wage-earners
their jobs.
Second—He advocated teaching aliens American citizenship, and sought
to make an impressive ceremony of a foreigner's induction into the prlvi
.•legee-and duttar of a citizen of the- TJfcited States.
Third—In a "preparedness" address in Cleveland he declared prepar­
edness must start with the working-man. "If we expect labor to fight our
nation's battles we must give labor a nation worth fighting for," said
Clarke.
Clarke's a bachelor at 69. He lives at the University club and he's
a highbrow.
While attorney for the Nickel Plate railroad he campaigned for Unit­
ed States senator on a two-cent fare platform. "I'm a lawyer for a cor­
poration, but not a corporation lawyer," he said. But he was beaten.
In 1914 President Wilson made him federal judge to succeeded Wm. S.

London, July 17.—The British ad­
miralty will publish a list of from
70 to 80 business concerns domiciled
in the United States with which resi­
dents of the United Kingdom are for­
bidden to trade. This will be the
first time that any American firms

jects to trade wih an enemy, that en­
emy domiciled in foreign countries
did not come under the act. France
and various other countries hold the
doctrine that their citizens cannot
trade with an enemy, no mater what
his domicile. Modern conditions of
credit and commerce make it possi­
ble for an enemy outside belligerent
territory to trade with his country.
Therefore, a considerable body of
opinion in this country urged the gov­
ernment to abandon its traditional
doctrine and the foreign office, while
not going to this extreme, decides to
prohibit persons domiciled in the
United Kingdom from trading with a
limited number of Individuals, firms,
and companies of enemy nationality
or associations under the same penal­
ties as though they were trading with
an enemy."
