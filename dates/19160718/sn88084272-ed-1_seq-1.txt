Count Karolyi caused a sensation in
the Hungarian parliament in December

that Hungary had achieved eerythlng
she desired by the war, had saved the
country from invasion and had pre
served the monarchy and throne and
that the Hungarians had a perrect
right to come forward with their claims
for compensation.
He argued further that the political
umtv of the Hungarian nation should
be recognized, that all the attributes
of a nation should be granted, and that.
above all. peace should be restored
We have given proof enough of our
physical courage." count Karolyi was

At the Juarez comandancla Tues

It was also learned that Gen. Paliz

with him.

reports in the United States of the de

that such commanders are widely

they could not cause trouble if they so

The senate today adopted the
enlarged building program of
the naval bill by a viva voce vote. It
provides for the construction within
three years or 157 war vessels of all
classes and for four dreadnoughts and
four battle cruisers to be built next
year.
Followed Admiral's ioggestloB.
In passing this measure, the senate
acted in exact accord with the recom
mendation of rear admiral Knight of
the naval war college, made in a report
which the officer submitted to. secre
tary of the navy Daniels concerning
lessons to be derived from the Jutland
sea battle. In this report rear admiral
Knight suggested that if the number
of capital ships to be constructed next
year be fixed at eight, they should
comprise four dreadnoughts and four
battle cruisers.
The intention of the navy depart
ment, if its suggestions can be favor
ably acted upon, is to restore the
United States to second place among
nations in naval strength.
Pacific Coast Disregarded.

of the new- battleships to be kept on
the Pacific coast. It was argued that
the amendment would be an infringe

Senators Jones and Phelan insisted
that the Paoific coast always had beea
slighted in naval ships and the latter
emphasized dangers of Japanese inva
