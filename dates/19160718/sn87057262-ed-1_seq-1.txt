THE UTMOST SECRECY
England Is Watching Like a Hawk,
Anxious to Pounce Upon
the Wonder
Ship.
BALTIMORE, Md., July 18.—The
German super-submarine Deutschland
was still at her pier here early to
day. As far as could be. learned
though, she Intends to dash for the
Virginia Capes tonight.
One of the Germans connected
with her venture announced early to
day that she had gone. A statement
from A. Schumacher and Company's
office, however, was that anything
told about the leaving time will be
a lie.
Despite this policy of misinforma
tion, everything points to an early
get away. The tug Timmlns, hover
ing close to the ship and her precious
cargo, is fully coaled. The last of
the visitors will be taken on the sub
marine today and some crew mem
bers not under orders to misinform,
says she is heading out tonight.
Negro stevedores put in a busy
night, tucking away the last of the
cargo and this work was due to be
finished today.
Captain Koenig refused to
aawir snrc .Treat,??
He still told friends lie -would get
home safely."
The captain of an incoming steamer
said today that England has a big
fleet of warships and trawlers and a
line of nets In the English channel
ready for the submarine. He believes
the British policy, Will be to let the
Deutschland pass "the capes safely
with a view to seising her later.
Wireless Lid Is On.
BALTIMORE, Md.,' July 18.—The
United States government today
barred its Tuckerton, N. J., wireless
station to the captain and manager of
the German subsea freighter Deutsch
land.
Messages answering congratula
tions from Berlin and bearing Ameri
can press comment on the Deutsch
land trip, were ruled off the appara
tus by the United States censor. The
Germans and German-Americans con
nected with the submarine venture
were plainly angered at this step, be
lieving it to be unneutral.
While they refused to be quoted
they indicated that they feel this act
to be overstepping all reasonable re
quirements of neutrality. They said
that absolutely nothing in the mes
sages could be of military value and
that they were not In code.
The Deutschland's loading neared
completion this forenoon. The last of
the rubber should be in her hold be
fore night, stevedores said. Two big
gasoline tank cars were backed up
to the wharf today and .it least part
of their contents will be dumped into
the vessel to feed her three powerful
Diesel engines.
Agents of the ship kept silent as to
the time of her departure.
Captain Says Good-bye.
BALTIMORE, Md., July 18.—Here
is the Auf Wldersehn of Captain
Koenig of the first trans-Atlantic sub
marine freighter as given to the
United Press for the people of the
United States
"Ihr land und stadt gefallt mir
sehr, und ich hoffe bald zuruckzukom
men. Die leute in Baltimore sind
sehr freundlich zu uns gewesen."
Translated this means: "Tour coun
try and your city please me much
and I hope to come back soon. The
people in Baltimore have been friend
ly to us."
Captain Koenig was not saying to
day that he would leave right away,
but consented, as a "preparedness"
advocate to give out the above fare
well just as a matter of caution so
nobody could say he had iot bade the
people good-bye.

ADVANCING THE LINES
Russian Left Wing Breaks Through
the German Line and Threat
ens to Surround the
Teutons.
PETROGR1AD, July IS.—The Ger
mans have retreated nearly ten miles
in Volhynla under the swift advance
of General Kaledin's left wing.
In their hasty retirement, several
thousand more prisoners, a number
of heavy guns and large supplies of
war material have fallen Into the
hands of the Russians. The retreat
was made necessary when several
Russian regiments broke through the
German front and threatened to sur
round a part of General Von Linsing
en's army. The Russians have ad
vanced their lines to the north bank
of the river Lipa and are strengthen
ing their new
positions
on the entire
front. The advance widens the
Russian salient, extending into the
AustioGerman front southeast of
Kovel, thus removing the danger of
crushing enemy attacks on both
sides of the Russian wedge.
All along the eastern front, the
czar's armies have suddenly resum
ed the initiative. The Russian left
wing in southern Bukowina is again
in motion against the reinforced
Austrian army. The Infantry com
bats are becoming more frequent in
Galicla and both artillery and in
fantry activity are reported on Gen
eral Kuropatkin's front in the Dvinsk
Riga region on the north.
The Russian commanders on the
Austro-German front, however, are
compelled to share public interest
with the Grand Duke Nicholas, whose
new offensive in the Caucasus con
tinued to "make progress.
On Austrian Front.
BERLIN, (via wireless to Sayville,
I.) July 18.—Russian troops are
everywhere on the offensive on the
Austrian front, but at only one point,
in Volhynla, have they caused an
Austrian retirement, said an official
statement from the Austrian war of
flee received here today. The state
ment admits the retreat of the Aus
trlans behind the Lipa river.
Buried In Cave-In.
JOPLIN, Mo„ July 18.—Rescuers
are digging frantically today to re

will be suffocated. The Imprisoned
men were still alive at nine a. m.

ST. PAUL, Min., July 18.—Prohibi
tionists who came to St. Paul one day
in advance of the opening of their na
tional convention, hoped against hope
today that their predicted merger with
dry elements of other partlee could
be accomplished. Up to the open
ing of the "get together conference"
today, at which scores of prominent
bull moose, dry democrats and dry re
publicans had been expected, there
were only a handful of other party
representatives here.
National Chairman Hinshaw and
other prohibition leaders, sought to
round up all the bull moose in sight
and found one, Colonel J. M. Inger
soll, of Idaho, progressive national
committeeman, from his state, who is
strongly in fvor of merging the bull
moose with the prohibitionists.
Colonel John M. Parker, of Lou
isiana, progressive nominee for vice
president, was reported today to have
turned the same kind of cold shoulder
toward the drys as did Henry Ford.
Telegrams from New Orleans today
Indicated that Parker had refused un
der any circumstances to be a pro
hibition candidate for vice president.
At the get together conference, ora
tory was to be free and unlimited.
•Delegates, including hundreds of
women who had spent sleepless
nights in hot Pullmans, found St.
Paul just as hot when they arrived
and prepared to take plenty of fans to
the convention hall.
Disappointment at failure of other
party chieftains to arrive, was echoed
early today in statements by some
prohibitionists that they would fight
any move to change the name of the
party.
"If we can't adopt the bull moose
orphans, what's the use of changing
our name to the progressive-prohibi
tion party?" was their line of reason
ing.
The race for presidential nomina
tion seemed to have narrowed down
to two today. Former Governor Eu
gene N. Foss, of Massachusetts, it
was reported had decided not to run.
J. Frank Hanly, former governor of
Indiana, and William Sulzer, former
governor of New York, were the ac
tive candidates.
A movement to change tl-e name of
the prohibition party to the national
reform party met with heated opposi
tion this afternoon at a conference
of prohibition delegates prior to open
ing of their national convention.
The movement launched by Colonel
J. M. Ingersoll of Idaho, progressive
national committeeman from that
state, who was the lone bull moose
attending the conference was design
ed to combine the progressive and

Buying Horses.
ST. LOUIS, Mo.. July 18—Leading
horse dealers in the market across
the river, today declined to say just
how many horses the United States
government had bought in the East
St. Louis market since the Mexican
trouble began.
It was learned through various
sources, however, that more than
three thousand cavalry mounts have
been purchased here during the past
few weeks.
The United States was paying more
for its horses than the allied govern
ments, one dealer said. He said the
European powers, tiring of the gaff,
are buying a cheaper grade. The
government is paying a good price
and getting better horse flesh, the
same man said. He would not divulge
the cost.
