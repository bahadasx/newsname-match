appeal to President Wilson for assist
ance In what they term a "business
crisis" will be made by representa
tives of the big railroads tomorrow.
Confronted on the one hand by
provision of the Clayton anti-trust
act, which they claim are hazy and
complicated, and on the other toy the
threat of 800,000 railway workers to
atrlke unless granted ahorter hours
and more pay, railroad officials de
clare their situation la serious.
The president will be asked In the
first place to anggest a delay in the
effective date of . the Clayton act's
publication, which governs the pur
chase of supplies by the roads, until
the railroad official and the Inter
state commerce commission "have
had opportunity to study It" Thla
is to' go into effect In a few weeks
unless congress delays It. .
The four great trainmen brother
hoods are voting on whether or not
to strike. Some administration offi
cials say a atrlke which would tie up
the railroads of the country at this
time would be a calamity.,
It is likely the railroad officials
when they see the president . to
morrow will take up this question
along with the other.' They desire

Washington, July 18. President
Wilson called at the capltol today to
urge personalir that senate leaders)
overturn the democratic caucus legis
lation program, which would have de
ferred action on the national child
labor MIL
The president talked with Senators
Kern and Martin. He asked, also.
It is understood, an early adjourn
ment of congress. The caucus data
of August 20 is satisfactory to him.
But he urged that the child labor
bill and the workmen's compensation
act be included In the program to be
completed by that time, despite every
adverse consideration.
After the conference with the pre- '
sident. Senator Kern said he believed
any necessary changes In the program
could be. effected without further
caucusing. - v".':;"--i f-. ...; v -''':,'- .'
The president In hla talk with Mar:

The fact ot the president's call ran
through the capltol like wild fire. The
smoking rooms were crowded with.
curious, puxzled, and , later, some '
angry senators. : .
(He talked with Senators Kern,
Martin,, Simmons,' Williams, Hughes
and O-wen. Some of them were call-;
ed from their lunches. The senate
floor Itself was deserted except for
senators v who wero ' making set
speeches to vacant seats on the nary
bill.
Republicans were disposed to poke .
fun . at the obviously disconcerted
democratic leader. '
President Wilson Informed leaders
of the senate that he did not wish to'
be notified of his nomination and to
berfn ,h!s, campaign until the child
labor -and workmen's compensation
