Company 30 men, K. Company
Oapt. Gipe and 1st Lieut Doan and
and 86 men, L. Company 42 meu,
M. Company Capt. Steveneson and
' 17omen.
Lieut. Peyton of Company G. has
a chance to be reinstated and friends
are making an effort in his behalf di
rect to Washington, The other offi
cers and men discharged will be leav
ing as fast as they can get discharges
made for they.
Corp. C. Eamby is very busy in
the work of making discharges for
men in Co. G. It is expected thai
discharged officers and their assistants
will soon be in position to complete
their roll at least in part so that these
men may be sent home.
The boys are-all looking cheerfully
to the coming of "Brother" Hawkins
who is to be Chaplain of the Third,
succeeding Dr. Frank Thomas, who
has served in that capacity for many
years and has resigned because of ur
gent church duties he cannot aban
don at this time.
George C. Atkinsoji and Paul M.
Moore spent Sunday visiting the offi
cers and nlen, especially of the Third.
Mayor Gatlm,"of Madisonville, and
Thos. Jackson, of Providence, were
among the visitors. The two latter
and Mr. Atkinson were enroute home
from Buffalo, where the attended
the national gathering of the shriners.
Mrs. Frank D. Rash and son Dill
man, are at Hotel Altamont, jnst
across the valley from the post,' and
will be probably until the time forde
parture of the troops arrives. Mrs.
Gordon, wife of Capt. M. K. Gor
don, of Madisonville, Mrs. Donan,
wife of Capt. Donan, of Providence,
and Mrs. Harlan, wife of Lieutenant
Harlan, of Providence, are all so
journing at Ft. Thomas and all will
probably remain while the troops are
stationed there.
Gen. Ro$r Williams' announce
ment last night that the Kentucky
troops would certainly be moved to
the border and that they would en
train in ten days sounds authoritative
though apparently in conflict with
announcement from Washington as
to general policy of the War Depart
ment. Gen Williams is known to
be very close to Gen Scott and is be
lieved to know what he is talking
'about. On Sunday all were believ
ing that there would be no move
ment for some weeks any way, but
the general's announcement puts
another light pn the matter entirely.
.i he Bee suggests that any friends
who contemplate visiting, he boys
while at Ft. Thomas should do it the
c. mlng week-end.

STEPS TAKEN TO PRE
VENT SPREAD OF DISEASE
Ft Thomas. Ky July, 18
Small pox was discovered in Ken
tucky mobilization camp this
morning. Examining physicians
found Herman Creed, private, F.
Compauy, 2ud. Regiment from
Jackaou, suffering from the ma
lady aud immediate steps were
taken to prevent spread of the
infection.
Creed was .removed to an iso
lated tent behind the field hospi
tal. The (quad of men with
whom he had been sleeping was
sepaiated from other men of the
Second Ragimeut.. Movemeutf
ofguardrmen in the latter unit
were ordered restricted to the
south end of the camp and orders
were issued that uo unvacciuated
man leave, or enter the camp. '
Rejected Guardsmen Held
Discharge of rejected guards

unless physicians kuow the men
have been successfully vaccinh
ted agaiust smal'pox. Visitors
are barred from the camp by spe
cial guard? at the gatesi amount
ing practically to quarantine of

Brmade officers aud physicians
believe prompt discovery of the

to preveut its spread. They say
every man in the camp has been
vaccinated. Lieut. Arthur Mo
Cormack, secretary of the State
Board of Health, is in the camp
aud is taking personal charge of
the situation (hat under other
circumstances would be alarming
Although ph)aioians fear no fur

COUP BY GENERALS
TO OUST CARRANZA
AND OBREGON, RUMOR
Bloodless Revolution, Headed
by Northern Military Lead
ers, Aims at Electing
De La Bara
EI Paso, Texas, July 17. An
ultimatum to leave Mexico is to
be presented to General Oarranza
and General Obregon by the
Mexican generals of northern
Mexico, according to reports
from Chihuahua City.
With the ultimatum backed
by almost the entire military
forces of Mexico, the leaders fare
said to believe a simple ultima
tum to Oarranzt and Obregon
would be sufficient ; that it would
be a boodless revolution, to be
followed by a national election,
at which Francisco de La Bara
probably would be chosen presi
dent, the government wouid be
refinanced and bandits wonld be
completely exterminated, before
the new government would ask
the recognition of foreign nations
Coup Meets With Favor
Rumors of tno approachiug
coup are gaining wide circula
tion in Chihuahua Oity, said the
arrivals,and it generally seems to
meet with popular favor. The
masses realize that under Car
ratizi they are starving, and they
are willing to undertake any des
perate enterprise for the sake of
their families.
Oarranza, ton, is blamed for
the contiuued presence of Amer
ican troops on Mexican soil. The
average M-xican believes, accor
ding to today's informants that
a threat delivered to the United
States before General Pershing
entered Mexico would have pre
vented the entry of the American
columns.
SHRINERS RE-
TURN HOME
Practically all of the members of
Rizpah's patrol and others who ac
companied them on their trip to Buf
falo, have returned home ana all re
port a delightful trip. Tbey were
royally entertained and had one grand
time. Several members stopped ov
er in Fort Thomas Saturday. and
Sunday and visited the soldier boys
and report them in fine health,
