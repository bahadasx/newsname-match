were estimated at about two hundred,
lie m. luted out. however, that the nn

would lio well for military authorities
on the American side of lha frontier
to be especially vigilant.
Water Abundant.
"With the advent of the rainy sea
son," he said, "the abundant water
supply makes It easy for small bands
to deviate from beaten roads an. I old
water holes. However, the Mcxh-.m
troops will do everything they can to
prevent the bandits reaching tho
American border."
Francisco I,. Trevlno, civil gi.vern.ir
of Chihuahua, announced today thut
he had Investigated the reported seiz
ure of the Hearst ranch at Ia'dcva
and had determined, he said, that the
property wart not confiscated, but that
the "cattle were merely detained to
prevent tho possibility of their being
moved across the border without pay
in duty."
Reports from Oeneral Luis Ilerrera

Milk and Ice Fund for Babies
Yesterday was an eventful day for the babies of Tulsa. The con
tributions to The World's milk and Ice fund reached a greater total
than on any previous day since the campaign was started. More
than half of the $500 needed is now in the hands of Humane Agent
Welch, who is putting every cent of the money to good advantage.
By the end of the present week every poor family In tho city will be
supplied with coupon books that will insure them a daily supply of
Ice and milk until the' worst of the hot period Is over. Hut to cover
the city thoroughly the total sum of 500 is needed. The people of
Tulsa are responding nobly to this humanitarian appeal and there
Is no question but that they will make up the balance in the next
few days.
