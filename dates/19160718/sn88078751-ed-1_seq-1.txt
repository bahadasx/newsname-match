RULING DELAYS

Guard Organizations Must Be Thor
oughly Equipped-
Mexican Border
To Meet
Washington, July 17. Transporta
tion to the border of national guard,
organizations now mobilizing will be
dolayed until they are thoroughly
equipped and organized.
Such Is the order issued by the war
department to all department com
manders. Tho effect will be to revoke a ruling
issued when the Mexican situation
was acute waiving certain require
ments. The order affects about 25,000
men still held in the camps
The latest information of the de
partment is that about 100,000 nation
al guardsmen now are at the border
"With thr C0.000 regulars there and
6,000 additional men called from the
reserves officials estimate that -"there
Is sufficient force to cope with any
present emergency and will make nn
necessaiy the dispatch of more
guardsmen until they are completely
equipped and organized.
Published reports that use of a gen
eral draft was being considered to fill
the national guard ranks were denied
by the department The following
statement was Issued by the official
press bureau: "The statement that
the war department Is contemplating
tho draft system to recruit the na
tlonal guard is nonsense. Statements
to that effect are purely speculative
and have no basis in fact."
Reports that national guard units
are being supplied poor and Insuffi
cient food are not borne out In pre
liminary telegraphic reports received
from all the department commanders.
These accounts uniformly declare

from Port of Spain, Trinidad, on tho

ported from the United Statea by a
special board of inquiry at tho Ellis

utes, was prhate. The charge against

as applied to Mrs. Castro was charac
terized as technical. '
General and Mrs. Castro, who had
been permitted to spend the night on
board the Vauban, now are detained
at Ellis Island.

writ of habeas corpus in a federal
court. Tho writ being granted, the
former president of Venezuela was

bond, pending an appeal by the gov
ernment. General Castro voluntarily
left the countrj before the appeal was
heard.

erick C, Howe placed his personal
quarters at Ellis Island at the disposal
of the Castros
Commenting on the action of the

tro said: "It is so strange, so strange,
I do not understand the procedure. I

last visit here will apply and I will be
released."

Captain Koenlg was quoted as saying,
"the trip of the Deutschland Is a
great achievement. You mustn't be
too enthusiastic over it, for a bigger
surprise Is coming. A great Zeppelin
airship or maybe I should say air
ships is being built In Germany. In
the not distant future one or more of
them will sail through the air to the
United States. Just as sure as the
Deutschland came to America, so will
the Zeppelin come." Ambassador von
Bernstorff visited the Deutschland at
Baltimore, and his visit was the oc
casion of a gala day for those inter
ested In the submarine enterprise and
for Germans In Baltimore generally.
He was accompanied by Hugo
Schmidt, New York agent of the
Deutsche bank of Berlin, and Dr. Al
bert, the American financial repre
sentative of the German government.
The three men were met by the Ger
man consul In Baltimore, Carl A. Lud-
eritz. The ambassador was In a jovial
mood all during the trip about Balti
