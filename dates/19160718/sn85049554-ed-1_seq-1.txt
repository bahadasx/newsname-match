Plans of Prohibitionists to
Align Progressives
Collapse.
MOOSE LEADERS
FAIL TO APPEAR
Drys Blame Colonel Parker for Non
Success of Scheduled "Get-Together"
Conference Hold Love Feast and
Revival Services Instead—President­
ial Field Narrows—Sulzer or Hanly
to Be Named as Party Leader.
St. Paul, July 18.—John M. Parker'S"
rallying cry to surviving, progressives
and his call Issued last Saturday, for
a new national convention of the party
in Chicago, Aug. 5, was blamed by
prohibition leaders here for the col
lapse of their plans for a great "get
together" conference at which they
had hoped to enroll scores of progres
sives, republicans and democrats.
Instead of a "get together" event,
the meeting became a prohibition love
feast, and revival services. The lead
ers had expected such men as William
Allen White, and Victor Murdock, of
Kansas Judge Albert D. Norton, of
St. Louis, and perhaps Colonel Parker
himself, to ^ifieet them and pledge their
affiliation with the prohibition party.
None of these appeared today.
"They are afraid to join us until
they know we intend to go after the
votes with a ticket every progressive
can support conscientiously," said
Chairman Hlnshav. Mr. Hinshaw. in
timated an intention to redouble his
efforts to Induce the Parker con^n
tion to endorse the ticket which the
prohibitionists will nominate here this
week.
H. D. Faris, of Clinton, -Mo., treas
urer of the prohibition national com
mittee, Inaugurated a boom today for
Dr. Ira D. Landrith, of Nashville,
Tenn., for president, and Miss Ada
Brehm, of Chicago, for vice president.
Hanly or Sulzjar.
Delegates to the national prohibition
convention today learned that,the con
test for the presldentiaV*nc[mthation had
narrowed overnight to a race between
former governors J. F. Hanly, of In
diana, and William Sulzer, of New
York, by reason of the announcement
by Eugene N. Foss, chairman, that he
would not be a candidate, should the
nomination be tendered him.
Henry Ford, of Detroit, failed to ar
rive on any of the early trains altho he
had been expected to attend the "get
together" conference. His absence
and silence lends color to National
Chairman Hinshaw's belief that the
manufacturer will not permit his name
to be placed before the convention.
BREMEN EXPECTED SOON.
Berlin Denies Destination of U-Boat
Is Rio Janeiro.
Berlin, July 18, via London.—The
Bremen report printed abroad that the
new submarine Bremen is proceeding
to Rio Janeiro is erroneous. It is be
lieved here that the reporn was pur
posely circulated with a view to elic
iting the real destinatim of the under
sea boat.
The Bremen left the Weser shortly
after the Deutschland and strict s«»
Vaaw 'flirfg
its destination.
U-Boat Policy Fixed.
Washington, July S.—The admin
istration has formulated the policy it
will pursue in case the German super
submarine merchantman Deutschland
is sunk without warning by allied war
vessels on it way hack to Bremen.
So long as the Deutschland is on top
"bf. the water the United States will in
sist that the allies treat it as any other
merchantman—that is, summon it to
stop by a shot over its bow, and tnen,
if it stops, board it as a prize fnd serFi.
it into port.
If, however, the Deutschland at
tempts to escape or resist capture, the
United States will have no further in
terest in its case if its efforts result
disastrously to itself.
The administration will regard the
Deutschland, while under water, as a
merchantman resisting capture and
therefore subject to such efforts as the
allies may make to destroy it or bring
it to the surface a prize. Also the ad
ministration will regard an attempt by
thes Deutschland to .submerge when
en&my vessels are near as an attempt
to escape.
Deutschland Ready to Depart.
Baltimore, Md., July 18.—The Ger
man submarine freighter Deutschland
now plans to slip down the Patapsco
river and into Chesapeake bay tonight
en route back .to Germany, a member
of the crew said today. Loading Should
be finished today at the present rate.
Captain Hinsch' announced no visitors
will be permitted to board the vessel
after today.
Captain Hinsch said he expects the
Bremen in a few days, and that it will
come here or to New York, tho he in
dicated Baltimore will be\the port.
The Inference from this generally is
that the Deutschland folk fear an at
tempt to wreck the ship. The Deutsch
Jand today was dressed up in fresh
green paint and decorated with traces
of white at bow and stern to resemble
the ocean waves.

west side and held the police at bay.
The dead include a white woman, who
came to her back door in the rear of
the building,the negro had barricaded.
Police reserves were called out on the
west side and more than 100 men sta
tioned themselves about the house, on
the porch of which two bodies coul'J
be seen. The name of the man If said
to be Robert Mclntyre. Later Mc
intyre and his wife were shot, bringing
the total dead up to seven.
The dead are:
Stuart S. Dean. GO, policeman.
Mrs. Josephine Overmeyer, -'8, neigh
bor.

^t S.jOii the- house In which the negro
w'as holding"duf against 'th4 pCUc^ was
dynamited.
The explosion blew the rear porch
and pantry of the kitchen into the
alley. Fifty rifles were ordered from
the police station. Chief «of Polico
Healv arrived at 8: lo. at wjich time a
second charge of dynamite was set off.
but without the desired result. At 8:20
a third, had failed. An auto patrol
brought the rifles and a fusilade of
bullets was poured thru the windows.
The negro for a time did not reply and
it was thought he wa. (lead, but pre
sently he began tiring with renewed
vigor. Hundreds of shots were ex
changed. The rapidity with which the
beleagured mad man fired led to the
theory that he had two rifles and that
his wife was loading them for him.
Mclntyre Was Religious Fanatic.
The police entered the house at 8:23
and found the man badly w.-und'd and
his wife dead. Mclntyre was taken to
a hospital where he died.

left a scrawl in which he .-aid that ho
was the. 'Spirit of the Almighty God
and that he must die to carry his "re
ports to the Almighty."
Mclntyre Fires on Neighbors.
The negro first attracted the atten
tion of neighbors by shouting about 3
o'clock in the morning. He grew more
violent towal-d 5 and alarmed neigh
bors came out to see what was going
on. He began to shoot and calls were
sent to the police.
Frank Freemuth. one of the police
men. told this story:
"Stewart Dean was shot when he
entered the house after breaking down
the door. I and four other policemen
were with him but he was the first to
enter. He was shot and killed the in
stant that he crossed the threshold.
Clement and Crabtree were shot when
they went in to recover Dean's body.
Both fell and we had to go in and get
the three of them.
"The crazy negro was barricaded
behind a trunk and other articles
when we went in. He had a rifle and
revolver and fired so fast that I could
not count the shots."
Negro's Wife Loads Guns.
Mclntyre's wife is supposed to have
helped him by reloading his weapons.
A cartridge belt was found around her
waist. The negro fired with delibera
tion, almost as tho at target practice.
Tt was 8 o'clock, however, three hours
after the firing of the first shot, before
the tragedy ended with the death of
Its instigators.
Policeman Dean was killed as he
broke down the door of the Mc-Intyre
house. Clement and Crabtree were
shot when they went in to get Dean's
body. Mrs. Overmeyer was slain
when she went In search of her hus
band who had been to investigate the
shooting.
Dynamite finally was exploded,
wrecking the house.. Mrs. Mclntyre

with bullets. She was found by the
body of her husband, who, altho
wounded, was leaning against a bed
room door Hading from the kitchen.
Before he could rise, a bullet from one
of the officers found its mark In his
head. He was taken to a hospital
where Me died.
