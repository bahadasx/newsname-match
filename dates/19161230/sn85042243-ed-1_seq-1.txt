PRATER SLATED.
\i. J. Prater, county treasurer,
assistant secretary of the senate
four years ago, is slated fer sec­
retary of this session. He acted
under Lieutenant Governor Kraa
bel and enjoys that gentleman's
confidence. Mr. Prater has had
considerable experience in legis­
lative matters and is being urged
to accept. If Mr. Prater accepts
the position, .Richard Penwarden,
county treasurer-elect, will take
charge of the treasurer's office.
With the announcement made early
this afternoon by Representative E.
A. 'Bowman of the Twenty-fourth dis­
trict that "everything looks favorable
to Wood," and that he had turned his
support and influence to the Ward
county man, it was a foregone con­
clusion that Howard R. Wood of Deer
ing would be speaker of the house.
"I was never in the race, hut some
of my friends were boosting for me,"
stated Bowman, when seen in his
room in the McKenzie. "I don't care
for the position and would rather be
on the floor. (I wish to state that I
am not in the race and have turned
my support and influence to iMr.
Wood."
Wiley Boom Loses 'Noise.
The Wiley boom has lost its noise.
It was exploded late last night by
friends of the representative from
Morton county. Active in the support
of the league organization and inas­
much as he has served years in the
'house, his friends wished _that he
should receive the preference, but
^prominent league chieftains made the
assertions that there "is nothing in
.' Wiley's candidacy," ahd that It is
"practically assured, that the »fljem-'
bers are behind Wood!"
Introduce Wood Sptakir.
So confident were some of the
league men that Wood would he en­
dorsed as speaker at the caucus to
be held late today or this evening
that the representative from Deering
was introduced to several of the in
coming members as "Representative
Wood, our speaker."
Wood, Wiley and Eowman are all
league members.
Waiting For Majority.
The caucus -Of (he members of the
lower house, which will elect the
speaker, awaits the arrival of enough
members to have a large majority.
About 60 or 70 had reached the city
up to the noon hour. WHth the Barnes
county delegation and others expect­
ed in this afternoon, it was stated
that it might be possible to have the
caucus late this afternoon or early
this evening, when the employment
committee will be named to confer
with the speaker regarding the dis
tribution of patronage. This commit­
tee, as in the past, will be made up
of one member from each judicial dis
trict, of a working organization of
12.
F. JB. Wood of Fargo, vice president
of the Non-partisan league, and father
of Howard R. 'Wood, arrived in the
city early this morning and when
seen in the lobby of the McKenzie
this afternoon, gave out the state
ment which led one to infer that his
assistance in boosting his son's can
didacy for the speakership was not
needed. Edwin Wood, a prominent
league worker, son of F. B. Wood and
brother of the candidate boosted for
speaker, is also in the city.
Senate Control in Doubt.
A quiet little caucus held last night
in which hold-over members and sen
ators elected last November against
the opposition of the league partici­
pated leaves the control of the senate
very much in doubt. But for the prob
ability of a constitution convention, it
is likely that little opposition to
league domination would have devei
oped in the senate. As it is, with the
prospect of a constitutional conven­
tion being constituted by members of
the Fifteenth legislative assembly
there is a disposition among such
members of the upper house whose
hands are not tied to find out what
there is doing and what part they are
to have in the doing of it.
The practical certainty of a consti­
tutional convention has placed an en
.. tirely new light on many propositions.
There is a tendency in various quar­
ters not to stay put in view of the
probable revision of the constitution
and a revamping of the basis upon
which all legislation, property rights,
rules of state government and admin­
istration are builded.

Germany Follows Up Failure
About Verdun With Bril­

By J. W. T. MASON.
Written for the United Press
New York, Dec. 30.—Events of the
past year have been disappointing to
all of the principal European belliger­
ents. The greatest victory of the
year has not been won on any of the
battlefields, but has occurred on the
floor of the Russian duma.
For the first time in the history of
the Slav empire, the Russian people
were able, toward the close of the
present year, to act in concert, and to
overthrow Premier Stunner, a well
known bureaucrat and reactionary.
The duma forieed a change in the
czar's government by a defiance of
the beaucratic regime that will be­
come one of the great landmarks of
the Russian nation's march toward
democracy. Cjompared with the Inde­
cisive conflict,vim eastern and west­
ern fronts, the victory of the duma
stands out as the most positive and
resultful accomplishment of the year.
The entrance of Rumania into the
war has provided the,most dramatic
spectacle of the twelve months' con­
flict. There is every reason to be­
lieve that the western allies did not
want the Bukarest government to
break its neutrality. The chance of a
successful German campaign such as
followed the belligerent action of the
Rumanians, was well realized in Lon­
don and Paris. But, imperialist de­
sires turned the heads of the Ruman­
ian militarists at a most inopportune
time for their own ambitidns. They
plunged into the war after Russia ex­
pended moat of her reserve ammuni­
tion in conquering Bukovina, and was
consequently unable to be of large as­
sistance to the Rumanian army.

SECOND NOTE.
(Associated Press)
Berlin, Dec. 30.—It has been
learned that a few days ago Pres­
ident Wilson sent a second noto,
explanatory of the first, to the
Central powers and the Entente
nations. This note has not been
presnted.
The reason for withholding the
second note is said to be that the
German reply received in the in
terum showed that the German
government had not been influenc­
ed by the "misconception regard­
ing the purpose and aims of Pres­
ident Wilson's step, which an un­
friendly press In both camps at­
tributed thereto."
(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 30.—The Ameri­
can government, it became known
authoritatively today, believes there
are three principal points in its note
to the belligerents and is surprised
that they are not more clearly under­
stood, particularly by the Entente
press.
Main Points.
These points, taken in the order of
their importance from the administra­
tion's viewpoint, are:
The fear that the po*mon.~4f neu:
tral nations be "rendered altogether
intolerable" if the war continues.
The suggestion that arrangements
be made as a guarantee against sim­
ilar conflicts in the future.
The proposal that means be found
for preparing the concrete peace
terms of both sides.
Arouses Comment.
The first point has aroused most
comment as was first emphasized by
Secretary Lansing's statements, after­
wards modified by a statement that
the United States might be drawing
nearer entrance into the war.
The administration, however,
thought that the suggestion for an
agreement to preserve peace in the
future, would attract more attention
among the Entente allies than it ap­
parently has, and furnish means
through which these nations could en­
ter with perfect propriety into a ser­
ious peace discussion.
No Ground for Fear.
If such an agreement could be ar­
ranged, the administration feels there
would be no ground for fear than an
agreement over terms made between
the belligerents would not be kept af­
ter the war ends. It pointed out to­
day that such a fear has been one of
the main objections of the Entente al­
lies to entering into peace discussion.
ANSWER READY TONIGHT.
Paris, Dec. 30.—The Allies' answer
to the German note of December 12
will be handed to Ambassador Sharpe
tonight, says the Petit Parisien, and
will bo published tomorrow..
It is long and sets forth again the
responsibility of the Central empires
for the European conflagration. It in­|ties

titutions demanded by the Entente as
outlined by Premier Lloyd George and
also that Germany, by failing to formu­
late proposals for peace, removes in
advance any basis for pours parlers.
The note seeks to suggest that the
Berlin cabinet, having proclaimed in
1914, its contempt for treaties, can­
not pretend to obtain the same condi­
tion as powers respectful of signa­
tures, and must offer guarantees.

(United pVess.)
Btorlin, Dec. 30.—Germany is as
ready for peace as she is for contin­
ued war. Her record of 1916 justi­
fies either. She begins the year
1917 with her lines on the western
front unbroken, after England's and
France's supreme efforts and this de­
spite the fact that her armies have
swept victorious over three-fourths of
Rumania.
Foremost of the year's events in
Germany was the proffer of peace by
the imperial chancellor, von ethmann
Hollweg. German public opinion ap­
plauds that sentiment which urged
this magnanimous tender. The chan­
cellor's speech in the reichstag and
his note to Germany's enemies aptly
summarized the view of the German
people.
For Allies to Decide.
In the German view, it is now en­
tirely a matter for the Allies to de­
cide—whether they desire to make
peace or continue fighting. Germany
wants peace—but her united public
opinion, her uncrushed army and na­
vy, are ready, to fight on.
As a matter of fact, Germany to­

Carl is the youthful successor of the
aged Franz Josef. During the inaugur­

the crown of St. Stephens, weighing
five pounds. All members of the
court were present as the peculiar
medieval ceremony was held. Mount­

(United Press.)
London, Dec. 30.—Not only will the
Allies' answer to the German peace
proposals set forth the aims of the
nations, but also the note will Btata
the terms upon which England and
her allies are willing to negotiate
peace.
This right-about in sentiment of
officials has been caused by the gen­
eral public sentiment and expression
of the press within the last few days.
The public and press have expressed
the idea that the best possible answer
to the German note is a concerted
statement by the Allies of their alms
in waging this war and then a state*
ment of the basis upon which they
would talk peace.
The Allied note is to be issued joint*
ly from Paris.

Washington, Dec. 30.—A break wit*
Germany on the submarine issue wilt
force Germany to present a better
working basis for peace, officials to­
day thought. The idea that a break
must come if peace fails is stirring
President Wilson to harder work on
his peace plans, these officials said.
Don't Want War.
Spain's action in sharply protesting
to Germany against unbridled sub­
marine activities is believed to .have
been inspired by the similar actions
of the United States. Spain's action
is believed to have impressed Germany
that other neutrals beside Spain and
the United States are loath to accept
Germany's submarine activities aa
friendly.
"The President is impressed that
neither the administration, nor( this
people of this nation want war," one
official said today. "He has further
been told that severence of diplomatic
relations means war. The only In­
strument to avert that condition Is to
bring about peace."
SOUTH AMERICA READY.
(United Press.)
Buenos Aires, Dec. 30.—If the
United States makes a formal request,
nearly all South American nations
will join the States in a peace note
to belligerent nations. This was the
statement of a high official today. Just
now it is realized there will be some
objection to such a step. News that
the Scandinavian nations have joined
in the peace note caused speculations.
Officials said no action would likely
be taken unless all South American
nations acted in unison. Some nations
were inclined to doubt the advisabil­
ity of such a step at this time.
