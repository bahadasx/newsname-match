Mr. Johnson, too, has had an inter
esting career In the public servlco.
In 1900 ho was appointed United
States Consul at Puerto Cabollo,
Venezuela, being transferred as Con
sul to Corlnto, Nicaragua, in 1909, and
to the Azores in 1912. While at Co
rlnto, he looked after the Interests of
his country during tho stormy days of
the revolution which resulted in the
downfall of Zelaya and tho abortive
revolution against Diaz.
His knowledge of Spanish has been
put to use In the translation of many
Spanish plays. Ho was the translator
for the English libretto of "Goyescas,"
the Spanish grand opera produced at
the Metropolitan Opera in 1915; and
Mr. Johnson also has several transla
tions from the French to his credit.
But it is as an American author that
he is best known. His poems have
appeared in the Century, the Indepen
dent, the Crisis and other magazines,
and his novel, "The Autobiography ot
an Ex-Colored Man," is one of the
most powerful stories ever woven
about the theme of race relations.
Mr. Johnson is a member ot the
American Society of Authors and
Composers; of the Civic Club, New
York, and is vice-president of the New
York Branch of the National Associ
ation for the Advancement of Colored

six weeks' mission throughout the
South, representing the National
League on Urban Conditions Among
Negroes, In an endeavor to persuade
the editors of the leading white news
papers to take an enlightened attitude
toward the exodus of Negro labor at
present going on. Everywhere he was
received with the greatest courtesy
and consideration, and much good is
expected to result from his presenta
tion of the Negro case.
Mr. Johnson's great abilities as
writer, speaker and politician wfll
henceforth be devoted to organize
millions of Negroes in America aij
spreading the doctrine of an uncoa
promising demand for their full rlgh
as American citizens until the pr;
gram of simple social justice
which the N. A. A. C. P. stands '
realized.
