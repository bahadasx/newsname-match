Fred Pollard, who defeated the Yale
and Harvard football teams, and
snatched the much coveted prize away
for the Browns, who is a student at
the Brown University and who is a
native of this city arrived home the
latter part of last week to spend the
Holiday season with his parents and
friends and to his everlasting credit,
he wears his new and great honors
with becoming modesty.
The Chicago Herald, in a recent is
sue spoke of him as follows:
"A Negro yquth, the son of a bar
ber, is Chicago's most honored football
player of the season of 1916. Pollard
of Brown, a student earning his own
livelihood while seeking education, has
been accorded the highest recognition
open to the college athlete.
"Chosen by most of the sporting
writers as a member of their group of
stars, the Xegro player has finallj' been
named by Walter Camp as a member
of his Ail-American eleven. The vet
eran Yale coach, of course, did no more
than sanction a success already regist
ered. As the leading member of a
team which triumphed over Yale and
Harvard Pollard had hitherto been ac
claimed as one of the great players of
the year. But this final selection as
sured the barber's son his place in the
annals of amateur sport.
"The Chicago Negro is not the first
Negro to reach this reward. A genera
tion ago William H. Lewis of Boston,
later an assistant attorney general of
the United States, was a Harvard con
tribution to the All-American football
team. Lewis first and now Pollard are
inspiring examples to their fellows.
They have proved that color is not an
insuperable handicap to honor on the
field of sport.
"The demonstration is altogether en
couraging. Incidentally, too, the larg
er public may take a wholesome satis
faction in the fact that a clean foot
ball player, an intelligent amateur, has
succeeded an unsavory pugilist as the
foremost athlete of his race."

PLANTS IN THE HOUSE.
(From the Columbus (Ohio) Journal.)
If you have not some growing plants
in your living-rooms put them in.
They tone np a home, give it a kindly
temper, inspire a love of nature and
cultivate a taste for the beautiful.
But more than this they have a prac-.
tical value. They create conditions of
health. If they flourish, then you have
sweeter and purer air to breathe. They
take in bad air and give out good.
So the family flourishes if the plants
flourish. Each plays into tho other's
hands. But the great thing is in keep
ing company with nature, which is the
finest association that comes into one's
life. It is the stimulus of peace, joy,
kindness and justice. The angels love
a home with growing plants and
flowers in it.
Mrs. Sidney of St. Louis, Mo., and
her daughter Miss Betty Ray, are
spending the holiday season with her
daughter Mrs. Carrie Warner, 5223 S.
Dearborn street.
