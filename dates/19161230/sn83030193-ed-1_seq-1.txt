MAY NOT GET LEAVE
Would Require Nearly Four
Months to Get Into Con
dition, He Declares.
TAIUS, Dec. 8 (by rnall).-aoorgo
Carpentlor, Frencn'w' Heavy weight
champion, will revilro nearly four
months to get Into condition for the
ring and it Is very doubtful whether
tho French army authorities will
consent to his leaving actlvo service
for so long a period.
Carpentler himself, !-.aro recuperat
ing after a bad spill from his army
aeroplane at tho front, mado this
declaration to-dAy. Tho French
puglllstlo star' condition Is such
thnt ho must mako dally visits to tho
hospital for treatment.
"I nm In a very bad condition." Car-
rentier said. "I consider that nearly
four months will bo necessary to got
me into sharwi niraln. The doctors n.iv
first of all I must havo complotn rest,
with nothing but tho mildest sort of
exercise llko cross-country wnlklntr.
Then I would have to begin a procoss
of long, gradual training.
"If by flsrhtlnk- with c-iov.is i p.in
help my country morn than I ran by
piloting an aeroplunc I'm naturally
wining to do so if I nm pormlttod.
"If sufficient leave Is obtainable I
am willing to light in America. I am
offered a light with tho Australian
Iam Darcy, but I prefer a chance at
mo cnampion, Jess Wlllard.
"Howover. talk Is futllo lust nnw.
I don't bellevu It Is possible for me to
leave.
"I am perfectly willing to fight WIN
lard, tho purso to go to charity work
for the allies. As a boxer I thus bo
llovu I may bo ablo to atrlko a. fw
blown In my own munncr In bohalf of
my people."
Carpentltsr was wearing his uniform
as a. member of tho Aviation Squad
when the correspondent mot him. lie
looked bigger and broader than ho did
when bo used to fight in tho ring, but,
paradoxically, his faco seomed thin
ner. Ills ohecks wero rather hollow.
-meres nwo uso in talking of a
match," ho said at tho outset, "even
If that match Is for the benefit of
cnarity unless I can got leave.
J am a soldier tlrst llko every
other ablebodled Frenchman. Hy one
duty now Is to my country."
Tho abovo despatch was originally
tiled, by cable, on December S. For
somo reason. It was never rernlvmi
here, but n mall copy of tho cable was
permitted to leave l'arls. The French
censor may havo objected at first to
tho despatch of tho story by cablo on
account of references to Carpentlct's
condition, but apparently tills objo.
Hon was lator removed.

ent. Mayor Mltchel and Pollco Com
missioner Woods. Thd terso argu
ment they offer all parties concerned
Ih that If you can't mako peoplo obey
tho law you can punish them when
they break It.
Summed up, Mayor Mltchel and
Commissioner Woods Intend that the
hotels and restaurants, tmva those
which havo all-night licenses hy rea
son ot being, food providers for all
night workers, shall stop the salo and
service ot drinks nt 1 o'clock and bo

"Placos of public entertainment will

Pollco Commissioner Woods said to
day. "Wo shall know Just what Is
going on on Now Year's Evo every
where In this city. Tho law Is to be
enforced rigidly. Thoso who vlolato It
will Ixi noted and arrests will as
suredly f 'How.
"I do not mean by this that the
police will bluster Into a placo and
place the proprietor or manager un
der arrest, when anot" t plan of ac
tion will accomplish the desired end.
Nor does It mean that tho patrons
aro to be Interfered with In any wy,
because they aro not violators in such
a case. Nor Is thuro to bo any attempt
to eject patrons from any hotel or
restaurant.
"It baa been said that torao of the
entertainment places Intended stop
ping tho salo of spirits und the like
at 1 o'clock, but would serve after
that tlmo all tho drink that farseelng
patrons could buy before tho shut-otr
tlmo us a nort of reserve supply. As
to that, tho law Is clear; there shall
bo no salo or delivery of intoxicants
after tho closing hour.
"Places of public entcrtalumont, tho
hotels and restaurants, aro peculiarly
In tbo power of tho Mayor, who can
revoke their all night licenses, for In.
Btance, That knowledge has, I fool
auro, reached them all. I have re
colved assurance from all quarters
that the law Is to be obeyed, but tho

It was said about City Hall that
tho management of tho Hotel Knick

BRITAIN AND HER ALLIES
BASE REFUSAL OF PARLEY
ON VIOLATION OF TREATIES
Paris Version of the Reply Is That
Germany in Failing to Formulate
Terms Removed in Advance Any
Reason for a Conference.
REPEATS THE DEMANDS
MADE BY LLOYD GEORGE
LONDON, Dec. 30. The allied reply to Germany's rea pro
posals Is understood to have been transmitted to American Ambassador
Page this afternoon.
PARIS, Dec. 30. The allies' answer to the German note of Dec 13
will be handed to Ambassador Sharp to-night this afternoon, New York
time, says the Petit Parlsien, and published to-morrow.
The note sets forth again the responsibility of the Central
Powers for the European conflagration. It insists on legitimate rep
arations' and restitutions demanded by the Entente as outlined by
Premier Lloyd George, and also says that Germany, by failing to
formulate proposals for peace, removes In advance any basis for
pourparlicrs.
The note suggests also that the Berlin Cabinet, having proclaimed
in 1914 its contempt for treaties, cannot pretend to obtain the same con
ditions as powers respectful of signatuies and must offer guarantees.

Thu thought that a break must

spurring President Wilson on, according-
to n Cabinet official, whits
th endorsement of his views by neu
trals Is maklntf him doubly anxious
to keep up thu work.
Tho action of Spain in vigorously

ment's purpose should all hop ot

held hero to havo been taken In the
hopo that It will Impress upon Ger
many that other ncutruls are behind
President Wilson's suggestions.
As outlined by a leading Govern
ment olllclul, the situation has sim
mered down to tbo point where peace
negotiations must centlnuo or this
country will bo forced, it it Is to be
couMstent tu Its policy toward Ger
many, to break with the Teuton
allies. Neither tho President nor tho
country wants war, tho officials gay.
War would result, tho President has

Tho ona Instrument left to tho Presi
