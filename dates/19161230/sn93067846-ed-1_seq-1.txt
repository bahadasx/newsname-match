Anderson Daniels Fires I'atal Shots
After Being Struck With Revolver
in Brother's Hands.
Florence, Dec. 16.? Wilbur Daniels
was shot and killed by bis brother
Anderson Daniels, at Hannah in the
lower part of Florence county Sun?
day afternoon a few hours after the
former had married MlM Vera Gas
kins, daughter of. John Gaskins, a
well known farmer of that section.
The marriage in the afternoon was
the cause of the tragedy it fecems for
Anderson Daniels is understood to
have advised his brother against the
I step. The marriage was solemnized
I Sunday afternoon and Wilbur Daniels
carried his bride to the homo of his
brother where he lived with another
hrother. It is said that Wilbur Daniels
took exception to the^ failure of his
brother and his wife to welcome Ins
wife and going to his brother Ander?
son':; room proposed to settle thO
matter with him and struck him with
a pistol. Another brother carried
Wilbur away to the homo of his fath?
er-in-law not far distant but as ha
nearcd the house he is said to have
returned to his brother's home. As
he came up the steps the fatal shoi
was tired. Wilbur Daniels died Mon?
day morning.
The coroner's jury exonerated An?
derson Daniels and he has been
granted ball and formally released.
1 The Daniels brothers were sons of
the late W. T. Daniels. Wilbu

denominations as small as $25, it is
expected, and will bear interest at a
rato 1 per cent, less than the in?
terest rate charged farmers on their
loans.
What this interest rato will bo has
not been definitely determined. It Is
limited by law to a maximum of 8
per cent. The expectation is that it
will not exceed 5 1-2 per cent, at
first and subsequently may he low?
ered.
Ix>ans on farming land are limitel
to 50 per cent, of the value of the
land and may be payable in from five
to 4 0 years. As fast as loans arc made,
bonds will be issued to cover them so
that at no time, under the present
plan, will a bank's entire capital be
tied up in loans to the detriment of
j other applicants. One of the chief
tasks now confronting the board is to
find experienced employes for the
new bunks. Moro than 6,060 appli?
cations for positions have been re?
ceived. The appointments will be ex?
empt from civil scrvico regulations,
but tho board intends to assemble a
corps of men experienced in banking.
The head of each bank will be des?
ignated as the registrar. They prob?
ably will be residents of the districts
involved and preferably attorney*.
Stock subscription books of the
hanks will be opened within the
next ten days, probably about Janu?
ary 2, to remain open for 30 days. It
is expected, however, that the gov?
ernment will have to supply most ol
the $6,666,666 capital, under thatSOC^

secretary of the treasury to make no

Temporary directors, five to each

serious attention by President Wil?

the necessary money could be raised.
The president is understood to op?
pose bond issues except for extra?
ordinary emergencies. To square with
:his view Democratic loaders in the
house propose' to put the issue of
Panama canal bonds directly upon the
military expenditures on account of
Mexico.
Speaker Clark behoves that an ex?

sible to meet the deficit by a bond
issue and income tax increases. Other
Democrats hope, however, that the
problem can be solved by pressing
