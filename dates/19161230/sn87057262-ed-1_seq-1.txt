The Belgian army which now holds
all of Belgium not in Germany's

[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Dec. 30.—
History was written for the aviation
corps of the United States army today,
when a flotilla of aeroplanes, piloted
by army aviators, flew from Hemp
stead, L. I., to the League Island navy
yard here—a distance of about 115
miles.
Corporal Salmon and Lieutenant
Coyle, who left Hempstead with
twelve other aviators shortly before
10 o'clock, were the first to reach
here. They landed at 11:32. Both
were numb from oold.
Almost before they were lifted
from their aeroplane, T. C. Millman
landed close alongside. Five others
then came swooping down at Intervals
of about four minutes. Salmon's time
for the flight was one hour and thirty
seven minutes. Thel fastest trains
require two hours to make the trip
from New York to Philadelphia.
Throughout the trip th% aviators
were compelled to fly\ at a great
height owing to strong air currents,
which were encountered. Thqy were
muffled up in fur ooats and caps,
but declared the oold was so'intense

[By Ed L. Keen, United Press Stall
Correspondent.]
LONDON, Dec. 30.—Not only will
the allies' answer to Germany's peace
proposals clearly set forth the prin
cipals for which the entente nations
are fighting, but it will contain a gen
eral outline of the terms on which
England and her allies are willing to
negotiate, it was confidently expected
here today.
The fact that the note would list
terms' to be demanded of Germany,
was expected as a result of an awak

England that the German propaganda
in netftral nations must be effectively

emies as a basis for even considering
talk of peace.
In Encland inueh significance in con
nection with Germany's plea for peace
was seen in (*eneral Sir Douglas
Haig's review of the Somme battle.
The British commander in chief sum
marized the result of the fighting with
the statement—"the Somme battle has
placed beyond a doubt the ability of
the allies to gain those objects"—re
ferring to objects for which the allies
are fighting. That Germany sent out
her peace feelers because she also
realized the Somme offensive was indi
