Present Tonight.
Carleton College All Stars again
'stepped on" the Big Bemidg team
of this city in the stecond of the ser
ies of three games scheduled for the
Armorv, last evening, the score be
ing 34 to 24.
The game was well played and the
locals played hard to even up the
-defeat of the evening before, and so
hard did George Graham work and so
hard were some of the bumps he re
ceived that he became exhausted and
collapsed.
The locals at times showed flashes'
^of good form but the team work of
the All Stars, made possible by their
long training and poundage of beef,
was a handicap too much for the Be
midg five to cope with. However,
there was plenty of interest and ex
citement and good playing on the
part of both teams to make the con
test worth while and a big crowd
should turn out tonight.
The games are giving Bemidji fans
an opportunity of seeing some of the
best basketball players in the middle
st in action as the visitors include
^jwii-state stars and players who have
attracted the favorable attention of
basketball critics throughout the
^United States Not only does the
%isitmg team include basketball stars

^gained fame on the gridiron.

They certainly are "there."

Boston, Dec. 30 Billy Sunday,
will vie with the Hub's merry-makers
in welcoming the New Year tomor
row night. The bon vivants will be
out to raise the devil, and Billy will
be out to down him.
At a night-watch service, the first
of its kind ever conducted by a re
vivalist, thousands will hear his fa
mous "Booze" sermon, while other
thousands are reveling in crowded
hotels and confettied cabarets.
Boston hotel men decided upon to
night as the official date for "New
Year's Eve" and its accompanying
celebrations. Shortly after midnight
1917 will be recognised with many
tippings of the flowing bowl and
much syncopated entertainments.
Somebody suggested to Billy Sun
day the idea of holding a revival at
the hour of the merriment's height.
"It's a bully hunch," he. sJaid. "Let
me think it over. I never tried it
beforeit never occurred to me."
Once Billy got hold of the idea, the
thing was accomplished.

TONGUE LASHING
Brother LaFreniere of the Grand
Rapids Independent received a se
vere tongue lashing one day last
week that he will remember for some
time. It did not come from his wife
nor from his esteemed contemporary,
Editor Kiley, but from a wagon
tongue that he was holding on his
farm while a pair of bronchos,
hitched to the rear end of the wagon,
were pulling it away from the house.
The vehicle struck a tree, the pole
flew around suddenly and gave Tony
a bat in the jaw and it took a doctor
and dentist several hours to repair
the broken bonesi Mr. LaFreniere
was publisher of the Northome Rec
ord a few years ago and will have the
sympathy of old time friends in this

BOY'S PAL POISONED
ATE WOLF DESTROYER?
