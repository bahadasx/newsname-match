A picture of the Monongahela river
bridge as proposed by William Meuser,
engineer of New York, is hanging
on the wall of Finance Commissioner
J. Walter Barnes' office at the city
hall. It Is a beautiful picture, showing
Fairmont with a concrete bridge with
a span of 402 feet, the longest single
concrete span in the world. Such a
span to quote the city hall occupants
"would advertise Fairmont all over the
world."
But the city doesn't seem to have
enough money to spend on this huge
advertising scheme because a bond
issue of December 6 called for a specified
amount to be spent on tho Monongahela
river bridge and the. advertlooment
would cost annrnrinmtalv 20

It la the hope however, of those interested
in building monuments in
Fairmont that some engineer will submit
a single span which will cost less
than the one submitted by Muesor.
It is also the hope that some contractor
will build the bridge within the
amount named in the issue.
This ought to be done, some say, by
contractors who are willing to lose;
some to advertise themselves as be |
