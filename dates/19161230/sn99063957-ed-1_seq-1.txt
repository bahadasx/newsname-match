-NEW MEXICAN POLICY
By Carl D. Groat.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Dec. 30. An entirely
new policy toward Mexico is virtually
completed and under consideration by
President YY llson.
According to the
ices, this proposed
e the followiuir i
most authoritative soui-
new plan will take the following
course :
Gerferal Pershing's forces now in
northern Mexico, will be ordered within
the border.
Thereafter the Mexican-American
commissioners will reopen negotiations
to clear up such peiiuing questions as
border patrol, protection of American
lives and property in Mexico and pos
sible financial assistance.
Ambassador Fletcher will be -sent to
Mexico City and Carranza's representa
tive here will be formally recognized by
this government-
These propositions, according to all
signs this afternoon, will be submitted
to the American-Mexican commission
when it meets Tuesday.
The first two suggestions are Car
ranza's. Carranza holds that for him to come
to any terms with the United States
while United States troops remain on
Mexican soil would be construed by this
country as having been forced on him.
Judge Charles A. Douglas, legal rep
resentative of Carranza here, today con
ferred with government officials on the
possibility of voluntary withdrawal of

t( the Belgian artillery by the Gr-r
mens themselves, When, as a last re
source in the fighting of 1914, the Bel
gians opened the flood gates that in

the Germans had to beat such a hasty
retreat that they abandoned heavy and
light artillery. Since that time this
perfection of the Bilgian "inundation

If the allies have been geaerous in

has likewise been as generous to its

Paris, Dee. 30.
The allies today form

aU' retu8ed t0 eter "eace gotiatto
with Germany without, knowing' wh

knowing' what
conditions the Teutonic powers have to
propose.
The note of the allies replying to Ger
many, as announced this evening,
charges that the German proposaj ap
pears more like a war measure than a
peace proposition.
The allies expressed their resentment
of the effort of Germany to place upon
them responsibility for the war.
The allies, in turn, charged the cen
tral powers with direct responsibility
for the war aud refusal to enter negotia
tions offered by France, England and
Russia to prevent it.
The note, signed-bv all of the entente
jowers, declared these nations were just
as strong in their attachment for peace
as in 1914, but added:
"After the violations by the central
powers, " and their engagement in war,
they cannot end the war at Germany's
suggestion without any conditions with
which to open negotiation!
"The German proposal is not an oTfer
of peace. The proposition appears more
like a war maneuver."
Iu reciting arguments designed to
place the blame for the war on the
central powers, the allies referred to
Gormany as ' ' the empire which pro
claimed that treaties were scraps of pa
per." The Text of the Note.
The note handed to the diplomats at
7 o 'clock said:
"The allied governments of Belgium,
France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan,
Montenegro, Portugal, Russia, Rumania
and Serbia, united in the defense of the
liberty of their peoples in true engage

arms and have decided collectively to
answer the so-called peace proposal.
"First of all the allies protest against
tho -enemy's assertions attempting to
throw on the allies responsibility for
tne war
Also the proclamation of the central
powers claiming victory. Both asser
tions are untrue.
"For .10 months the allies have sus
tained the war which they did the ut
most to prevent and they have showed
by their acts their attachment for peace.
"This attachment is just as strong to
day as in 1314.
"After tho violations (by the central
powers) and their engagement in war
they (the allies) cannot end the war
at Germany's suggestion without any
conditions with which to open negotia
tions." "The German proposal is not an of

they were fired on when about

everything was put in readiness

Loudon, Dec. 30. Xot only will tho
allies answer to Germany 's peace pro
posals clearly set forth the principles
for which the entente nations are fight
ing, but it will contain a general out
line of the terms on which England and
her allies are willing to negotiate, it
was confidently expected here today.
The fact that the note would list
terms to be demanded of Germany was
expected as a result of an awakening
within the last few dhys in England to
the fact that the German propaganda in
neutral nations must be effectively ans
wcred.
Press and public alike united today in
the belief that tho best possible ans
wer would be a comprehensive reaffir
mation of the allies' aims and a state
ment of what the allies regard as nec
essary concessions from their enomies
as a basis for even considering talk of
peace. Germany 's reply to the Ameri
can peace note, it was pointed out here.
failed to meet the principal request
of President Wilson 's appeal lor a
listing of possible peace terms.
Meanwhile, Europe's interest center
ed in Paris, where the note is te be
issued. The entire entente press today
reflected tense realization of the im
portance, of the document.
Notes Are Completed
The allies' note has been completed.
Russia's draft waa probably in Paris
today, with that of all the other on
tente powers. The message will go
forward through American, Swiss and
Spanish diplomatic agents in Pan
within the next few days and. its text
will be made public from Paris before
next Wednesday. There was one re
port in London today that the public
might be informed of the contents of

Want Trade Commission
To Fix Price of Paper
Washington. Dec. 30. Price fixing by
the federal trade commission as a solu
tion of the news print paper price prob
lem, was urged by Represeutativt Cram
pton of Michigan, today when he up
peared before that body.
"If the constitution permits one man
or group of men to control a necessity, "
declared CrampHm, "certainly the gov
ernment ehould be permitted to fix the
prices of such necessity. If it is at all
possible for this government to regulate
a combination, it is high time the gov
ernment did it in this case.
"All publishers apparently are get
ting news print paper, but through de
vious ways and at a terrific extortion
ate price. If the trade commission
wants additional power to stop this,
congress will give it."
Commissioner Davies said between
46,000 and 50,000 tons of news print pa
per are needed immediately by pub
lishers. The commission has not deter
mined whether relief can be obtained,
he said. He suggested another meetine
of publishers and manufacturers to find
whether the paper shortage cannot be
overcome.
"The commission is going to deter
mine in the very near future whether re
lief can be obtained," Davies conclud
ed. "It's report to congress will also
be made in the very immediate future."

Philadelphia, Dee." 30.- History was
written for the aviation corps of the
United States arrrjy today, when a
flotilla of aeroplanes, piloted by army
aviators flew from Hempstead, L. 1.,
to the League Island navy yard berc
a distance of about 115 miles.
Gorporal H. H. Salmon and Lieuten
ant A. M. Coyle. who left Hempstead
with twelve other aviators shortly be
fore 10 o'clock, were the first to rearh
here. They landed at 11.32. Both wcro
numb from cold.
Almost before they were lifted from
their aeroplanes, T. '. Millman landed
close alongside. Five others then canio
swooping down at intervals of aboat
four minutes.
Salmon 's time for the flight was one
hour and thirty seven minutes. The
fas est trains require two hours to
make the trip, from New York to Phil
adelphia. Throughout the trip, the aviators
weie compelled to fly at a great knight
owing to strong air currents which
were encountered. They were muffled
up in fur coots and caps but declared
the cold was so intense It was difficult
to keep their bauds on the steering
wheel.
Lieutenant Bagnell arrived at the
League island navy yard at 1:45 almost
unnoticed by the - crowds that wero
busy looking over the machines. He
had been compelled to fly slowly be
cause of the strong air currents ;md
freezing temperature.
At 12.30 this afternoon, eight ma
chines had passed over Camden and.

Twelve machines started from Hemp
stead but two wero compelled to turn
back after traveling as far as New

ing again took to tho air at Hempstead
and was oxpeeted to reach hero within
an hour.
At Philadelphia the officers will be
guests of the reserve ships of the At
lantic fleet. Tho return trip will ho
made tomorrow morning.
The distance is about 113 miles from
Long Island and was expected to re
quire an hour and a half for the flight.
Captain J. E. Carberry of the avia
tion section, U. 8. A., had charge ef
the flight, assisted by Captain W. G.
Kilncr, also of tho army aviation ser
vice. Captain J. B. Stetson, Jr., was a
