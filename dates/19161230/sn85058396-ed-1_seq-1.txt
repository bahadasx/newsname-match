lies' answer to. the German note of

Wilson's Second Note.
Berlin, Dec. 30, via London, 10:10
i. m. It has been learned that a few
Jays ago President "Wilson sent a sec
3nd) note, explanatory of the first, to
thelcentral powers and the entente na
tions. This note has not been pre
r , sented.
v The reason for the withholding of
y thejsecond note is said to be that the
German reply received in the interim,,
showed that the German government
. ' had! not been influenced by the "mis-
conceptions regarding the purpose and
aims of President Wilson's step, which
Ian iunfriendly press in both camps at
tributed thereto."
f Madrid, Dec. 30, via Paris, 5:50 a, m.
Spain's reply to President Wilson's
t nofe will be handed to the American
charge d'affaires tonight and will bo
made public at noon tomorrow. Pre
mle'r Romanonos drew up the note in

's pons which have been spread abroad
jj that it is proposed that the peace con
fi ference is to be held at Madrid.

Secretary Lansing has been most
emphatic ever since his two state
ments were issued in saying that the
president's note was 'absolutely self
explanatory and required no further
comment. He has stated also that spe
cial Instructions were sent the diplo

WILSON NOT A
MERE PUPPET
" i
Secretary of German Jewish
Aid Society Warns People
Not to Make Mistake.
NO WEAK CHARACTER
United States' President Is
Hard to Deflect From
His Purpose.
Berlin, Dec. 29, via London, Dec. 30,
10:25 a. m. Dr. Paul Nathan, well
known in America as the secretarw
of the German Jewish Aid society, In
an article in Der Tag, warns tho
Germans against the view that Pres
ident Wilson is a mere puppet pulled
by British wires. The article, which
Is a' good example of moderate Ger
man views, is based on the assump
tion that President Wilson is pursu
ing a policy dictated solely by prac
tical American interests and in the in
terest of a people who are exceeding
ly proud of their independence and
national characteristics.
"So much power is attached to the
presidency," writes Dr. Nathan "that
even a weak president would hardly
become dependent upon a foreign
country. But President Wilson is by
no means a weak character. On the
contrary he is hard to deflect from
his purpose. His noto and Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg's speech show
that the ultimate aims of American
and German policy have drawn sub
stantially nearer and it does not lie
in German interests to ignore that
fact and render impossible further de
inr,ments in this direction through
unjust attacks.
"President Wilson ?.nd Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg do not say
the same thing and yet their utter
ances are similar, whereas, President
Wilson's note and Premier Lloyd
George's speech present a hopeless
dissonance. Germans are entitled to
strongly emphasize the fact that Ger
man policies and tho policy of the
mightiest neutral state are not in ir
reconcilable conflict."

Plans for Railroad Legislation
Not Changed, Notwithstand
ing Failure to Agree.
Washington, Dec. 30. President
Wilson went to the capitol late.tpday
and conferred with Chairman Nowr
lands of the senate interstate com
merce committee about expediting tho
railroad legislation program in view of
the failure of the railroads and the
brotherhoods to agree on an applica
tion of his Adamson law.
The president talked with Mr. New
lands for ten minutes and although
tho senator declined to discuss his
visit it was understood ho was anxious
that the proposed legislation be
brought out of the committee as quick
ly as possible.
"There was no Indication," said
Senator Newlands, "that the president
had in any way modified or altered
his suggestions "for legislation."
Mr. Newlands said he believed the
committee should be able to conclude
its hearings on arbitration legislation
in two days next week.
Washington, Dec. 30. Chairman
Newlands of the senate interstate
commerce committee said today the
failure of railroad brotherhood offi
cials and the railroad managers to
eeach an agreement regarding an
eight-hour schedule pending determin
ation of the constitutionality of the
Adamson law would not alter its plans
for consideration of railroad legisla
tion urged by President Wilson in
his last message to congress.
"Wo will proceed' as usual, but with
expedition, I hope," said Senator
Newlands. "I do not know just who
will appear before the committee I
Tuesday but representatives of the
brotherhoods, the railroad companies
and the general public have been in- I
vlted and I hope that the proposed
legislation can be given consideration
in tho senate and the house."

Cleveland, Ohio, Dec. 30. Warren
S. Stone and W. G. Lee, heads of the
railway engineers and railway train
men brotherhoods respectively, arriv
ed in Cleveland today following the
rejection of the demand by the man
agers committee that the Adamson
law be placed in effect January 1.
"It is highly improbable that there
will be a strike Monday," Stone said.
He declared the report that a cir
cular letter had been sent to railway
employes asking for a renewal of the
authority to call a general strike,
were untrue.
"No circular has yet been prepar
ed," he said.
Stone said no further statement
.w.qii)d,.he fo.rtb coming t-aday in -Cleveland
aiid thai" 'there wuld be no
meeting of the brotherhood heads.
It was pointed out that a general
strike Monday was an impossibility
because of the fact that the railroad
unions would have to be first notified
of such an intention and they would
have to notify their sub-chairmen.
Lee said he had nothing to add to the
statement given out yesterday in New
York.
"There will be no immediate
strike," he said.

Danube Army Almost Station-
ary Moldavian Force Push-
ing Back Russians. C-fl
London, Dec. 30, 3:35 a. m. The ;H
military operations on which interest ;B
is chiefly focused at present are the
great efforts tho central powers are
making against the Russians and Ru- H
manians. This campaign is proceed- H
ing on a front of about 120 miles H
reaching from Oituz pass to the Dan- jH
ube. One main object of the attack H
is supposedly tho capture of Braila.
The central forces are' divided into H
three armies, namely, that in the H
Moldavian mountain., region, .com-
manded by General yon Gerok, the ;H
Ifinth army under General von Falk- 'JH
enhayn which is operating on both ' H
sides of the JRimnik and the Danube; H
and the. Danube army composed of JH
Germans, Turks and Bulgarians un'der 'H
General von Kosch. iH
Falkenhayn and Gerok Advance. jH
The general outcome of the opera- JH
tions during the last week has been
an advance of several miles by Gerok
and Falkenhayn with the capture of -H
many prisoners. The Danube army YH
has been almost stationary, the in- '.M
vaders being little nearer Braila than
they were ten days ago. The pressure,
however, on the Russian right flank H
in Moldavia and in the center Is slow- H
ly bringing the invaders nearer the H
fortified lines on the Sereth, whicb ' H
completely divides Moldavia and ; H
lachia. 'H
The only point oflnTiJftjtnarkeii ' H
by the niilitary critics hero inrt?gS4jfJ-iJH
to the western front is a reference in" lk
tho communique issued by the Ger- ,-,'H
man war office to the "new position H
north of the Somme." It is not known
whether this phase has any special
significance. IH
Tho version of the Gorman cam-
raunique of Friday night, received ;IH
here by wireless, makes no reference
to a "new position north of the Som- 'M
me" referred to in tho London news
papers. The only statement in re-
gard to tho Somme region, according -Sl
to tho wireless version, was that a fH
stronger artillery fire had developed
north of the river. t
