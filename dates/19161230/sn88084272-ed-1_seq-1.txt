To Belligerents.
PARIS, France, Dec. 30. The en
tente allies' answer to the Ger
man note of December 12 will be
handed to American ambassador Sharp
tonight, says the Petit Parisien. and
published tomorrow.
It is long and sets forth again the
responsibility of the central empires
for the European conflagration. It in
sists on legitimate reparation and
restitutions demanded by the entente
as outlined by premier Lloyd-George
and also says that Germany by fall
ing to formulate proposals for peace,
removes in advance any basis for par
leys. The note seeks to suggest that
the Berlin cabinet, having proclaimed
In 1914 Its -contempt for treaties, must
offer guarantees.

terms.
Secretary Lansing has been most
emphatic ever since his two statements
v.ere issued m saying that the presi

planatory and required no further com
ment. Three Points In I'eace Offer.
The American government believes
there an- three principal points In its
note to the belligerents, and is am -prised
that they have not been more
clearly understood.
These ooints are:
The fear that the position of the
neutral nations may be "rendered al
