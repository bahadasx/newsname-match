ROLE REQUIRES SECRECY
WiB Not Give Up Both Her
Territory and Her Colo
nial Possessions.
Vashington, Dec. 29. A policy
of
absolute silence regarding the
peace negotiations has b6en adopted
by President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing'. It was stated officially to
day that all steps henceforth will bo
regarded as confidential, that no com
ment will be made on any develop
hient and that rumors will not be dis
cussed in any way.
The decision to Dursue this course
was made known after the state do
partment had received the official
texts of the German and Austrian re
plies to President Wilson's notes to
the belligerents -and after it waa
earned that the Teutonic powers
would be willing to permit a confi
dential exchange of tentative terms if
it became necessary to do so to bridge
the gap threatening to preVent a gath
ering of peace delegates.
So far as the entente governments
are concerned, it is understood that
little if any confidential information
has reached here to shed more light
on their attitude than has been given
publicly in speeches of their premiers
and the comment of their press. Con
sequently there isno disposition here
to doubt that the allies unanimously
will refuse to enter anysort of peace
conference until Germany has indi
cated clearlv on what conditions she
will stop fighting,
On the Teutonic side while the re
ply to President Wilson's suggestion
offered a method of procedure, Uer
many is said to be willing to con-
sider other suggestions regarding
methods from any quarter, including
her enemies.
Diplomats familiar with the view
point of Germany and her allies were
especially emphatic tonight in saying
that Germany necessarily would be
able to make much better terms in
confidential negotiations than in pub
lic. The radical element in German
politics, it is said, must be considered.
Under any circumstancos however it
was said Germany would not consid
er making peace if the entente should
insist upon retaining Germany's lost
colonies and requiring Germany at
the same time to evacuate all enemy
territory now occupied.

Data of Withdrawal of

Washington, Dec. 29. One more
appeal for modification of the proto
col providingtor the withdrawal of
American troops from Mexico is made
by Gori. Carranza in a message deliv
ered to Secretary Lane by Luis Cab
rera; chairman of the Mexican mem
bers of the joint commission.
Tho Mexican first chief replied to
the insistent American demand that
the protocol signed by his spokesmen
at Atlantic City be ratified with an
800iword document in -which he failed
to accede to th'e demand, but refrained
from writing anything that could be
constructed as a flat repudiation.
The latest suggestions for changes
in the agreement now will be consid
ered by the three American represen
tativesSecretary Lane, J. R. Mott
and Judge George Gray. Secretary
Lane advised his colleagues late to
day of the character of the reply and
asked them to meet him here as soon
as they conveniently could.
Early next week a joint session of
the Mexican-American commission
will be held at which the Americans
will give tho Mexicans their answer
and on its nature depends the future
course of the commissioners who
were directed more than f out months
ago'to effect, if possible; the adjust
ment of questions at issue between
the two countries.
Neither Mr. Cabrera nor Secretary
Lane would discuss the nature of
Carranza's reply.
