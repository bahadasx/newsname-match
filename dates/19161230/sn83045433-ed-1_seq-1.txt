TEUTONS DRIVE
AT ENEMY WING
Mackensen Rolling Up South
ern Russo-Rumanian
Line.
The momentum of the Teuton offen
slve against the Sereth line has sudden
ly switched far to the north'of the scene
of the great flve-day "break through"
battle.
With the culmination of that battle.
consisting in the capture of the big rail
head at Rimnicu-Sarat, the period of
strategic "feelers" was terminated in the
last thirty-six hours, Mackensen.
prompted by the swift succession of
events furthering his plans, "showed his
hand."
From the mountainous region around
the town of Sosmnezo, just above the
northermost tip of the Transylvanian
Alps, there was set into motion early
yesterday an evidently powerful force of
Teuton infantry under Gen. Gerck. As
if only the field marshal's "vorwaerts"
had been needed, this column pushed
promptly forward, driving due east, cap
turing heIghts after heights and driving
the surprised Russians further and
further against the middle Sereth.
Fourteen hundred Russians I- I into
Gierok's hand in the initial onrush of his
army and eighteen machine guns and
three cannon were captured.
Moreover from the Petrogtad war of
flice came the ominous admission that in
this area "the enemy's advance continues
at several points."
Rolling Up South Wing.
T' , German official report makes it
clear that this sudden offensive between
the Carpathians and 'transylvania is "in
co-ordination with movements in great
Wallachia."
To Gen. Gerok evidently has fallen
the chief part in Mackensen's plan to
"roll up" the entire Russian southern
wing, to clear Southern Galicia. the Bu
kowina, the Carpathians and Transyl
vania of Muscovities, and to make pos
slo, the piercing of the Sereth line and
the subsequent drive at Odessa.
From Rinnicu-Sarat, Falkenhayn's
troops, constittiing the now famous ninth
army, are hastening at top speed north
ward to reinfurce iecrok. should the Rus
sians stop him as they will undoubtedly
try. Already Bavarians and Austro-ilun
gary troope. under Kraft von Delmen
singen, on the left wing of the Ninth
army, have pushed thirteen and a half
miles beyond Rimnicu-Sarat to Dumitresci
some forty-nine miles from where Gerok
is driving eastwards.

Or First Chief Carranza Will
Not Negotiate.
First Chief Carranza is unwilling to ne
gottiate any of the questions bftween the
United States and Mexico. pending the
withdrawal of the American Expedition
ary Foree now in texico under the com
mand of 31aj. G)"n. Pershing.
This, aIparentl. ir the objection raised
by the First Chief to signing a protocol.
I Divested of its conelliatory verb:age the
answer of ir. Carrarrza to the demand
of the Ameroean commisioners for nia
sgigatire Jo the document is just this.
in his note re directs th. attenton
of this government to the fact that the
Consitutionialt rovernmtnt never con
sented to the cerossine of thre border by
American troops. iis grrernmrent is
unable ttrror to make tne withdrawal
of the Ameriat columnj a cotnditin
precedent to the Iortion of a treaty.
The Firat tief -uggests to the Ameri
can goverratnt that all ttestions now
in dispute shall b. held in abhyance pend
ing the wlthdrawal of the Ameri-an
forces folloing which he wl be very
glad toarrange for a ont commisoion
to set aright the entire international sit
uaton In w: h the two alitnt matters
of imputtance are the protctinn of tor
eigners from drath tr dittmilment and
the proteratn of th- itiernational band
ary line 'roem mrarauding hands of Mt-i
can outl.aws.
How I1r. tarotna's latest suggestion is
viewed hy th adminitration is prob
lematical. It is rpressai in some quar
ters that Preiden Wilson and his ad
vsers nay he n willig, to terate, further
negotiatit., in tt hope of anerting a
return to the st-tusF of affat s.
The views of the American commision

New York. Dec. X.-No general strike
will be called on the country's railroads
on Monday or within two months of that
date. But a second strike vote of the
35J.1 railroad empoyes will be taken.
The four brotherhood chiefs came to
this decision today, following a flat re
jection of their demand upon the na
tional conference of railway managers
that the Adamson eight-bour law be
vlaced in operation Monday.
"The men are gradually coming to the
conclusion that the railroads are deter
mined to make them victims of a bm
boosting scheme." heatedly asserted a
brotherhood representative. "It was
made Plain at today's unsatisfactory con
ference that the railroads Intend to block
indefinitely the placing in operation of
the Adamson act. This without regard to
the deislon of the Federal Supreme
Court.
