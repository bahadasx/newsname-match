fers of this nature were made by ad
mirers of bin puldlu life.

his hand cam wield u pen, to execute
the will of the people who sent him
there.
Mr. de Hacu's. anouncenieiit, deliver
ed from an Invalid's chair in the hos
pital, come us the climax of a bitter
anil sensational campaign and clarities
a situation unique In the annuls of
state elections. Although It pronounc
ed ltB will In November, New Mexico
has, until today, "been left to conjec
ture as to' who would be Its governor.
Mr. de Baca, who has been serving
i,s lieutenant governor under William
Mclonnld, ran for the higher ornee
fills year on the Democratic ticket,
while Uovernor Mclionalil sought elec
tion as lieutenant governor.
!,nst February, de Haca' ailment be
came acute, but he would not abondon
the stump, In spite of rigorous chills
and sudden accessec of weakness which
assailed him during his speaking tours
aViout the state.
His Illness was well known to the
voters. Nevertheless, they presented
him with the ottlce. assured." In his
own words, "that lie would not have
offered himself as u candidate had he
not deemed himself able to fulfill the
duties Involved." His victory was
partially offset by the defeat of Mc
Donald for lieutenant governor
the election of W. K. l.lndsey, a
a n d
He
publican, to thai ottlce. .
Meanwhile, it was considered re
markable that de Haca had lived to
hear of his success. With his political
opponents proclaiming that his failure
to qualify January 1, would Incur the
forfeiture fo his oltlc.e, the govcrnor
elust left Santu Ke for Los Angeles,
arriving here unannounced November
19.' determined to wnrd off the specter
iti.it Flooi. between him and the peo
ple's trust. He put himself In the
hinds of Dr. N. H. Morrison, chief
suigeon of the Coast lines of the Santa
Ke railroad, und only his friends here
know of his presence at the hospital.
The republicans In New Mexico
promptly announced that, now that de
Haca was hors du combat, W. K. l.lnd
sey, lieutenant governor-elect, would
take the oath of ofllce January 1, It

Applications for loans have been pour
ing in to the board in great volume re
cently and It Is estimated that a sum
more than twenty times the combined
capital stock could be used In muklng
loans.
Almost tiie first work of the banks
after approving and issuing luana will
be the yssuance of farm loan bonds, a
new form of security In this country.
The bonds will be issued in tlenuuiliia-
j tlons us small at 125, it Is expected, and
i will bear Interest at u nate 1 per cent
j less than the Interest rate charged
' farmers on their loans.
What this interest rate will be has
1 not definitely been determined. It Is
I limited by law to a maximum of A iter
'cent. The expectation Is that It will
I not exceed 5 per cent at llrst and
f subsequently may be lowered.
I Loans on farm lands are limited by
j law to half the value of the land and
1 may be payable in from five to forty
years. As fast as loans are made
; bonds will be Issued'to cover them so
that ut no time under the present plan
I will a bunk's entire capital be tied up
! In loans to the detriment of other ap
; plicants.
One of the chief tasks now confront
ing the board is to find experienced
employe for the new bunks. More
than 6.UUU applications for positions
have been received. The appointments
will be exempt from civil service regu
lations, but' the board intends to as
semble a corps of men experienced In

640 ACHE BILL SIGNED
Washington, Dec. 29. President Wil
son late today signed the Ferris bill
opening up 640-ncre homesteads for
stock raising and grazing purposes. It
Is accounted of great Importance to the
western states.
The bill authorizes the secretary of
the interior to designate the land
which will be subject to entry under
this bill. It will require some time to
do this und those who attempt to
make filings under the bill prior to
such designation by th secretary must
do so at their own risk. The bill pro
vides, however that settlers may file on
bind before the secretary has complet
ed the work of designation. The ap
plication must be accompanied by affi
davits showing that In the opinion of
the entrymaii the land Is of the char
acter conten, plated by the act. In ad
dition to that the entrymun must de
posit with the land ofllce the regular
fees and commissions nnd thereupon
the land will be withdrawn from entry
until the secretary of the Interior
shall have an opportunity to determine
Its character. The entrymun. however,
will not be permitted to occupy the
land until the sccretury has actually
designated it as subject to entry.
Any person qualified to make entry
under the general homestead laws ot
the I'nlted States may make a stock
raising homestead entry. Instead of
cultivaion, as required by the general
homestead laws, the entrymun will be
required to make permanent Improv
meiits upon the land of a value of not
less than 11.25 per iter-, and at least
one-half of the lnipr,j, . ..nis must be
placed on the laud within three yen ra
from the ilr.te of entry.
The bill provides that settlers who
have made tilings under the general
homestead law and amendments there
to may make additional tiling sufficient
to give them 6ln acres. However,
tile y u.usl shuu thai the land on luel
they originally tiled is of the same
character as the land affected by the
6411 hill. In other words, that It Is
"chiefly valuable for grazing and rais
ing forage crops, does not contain
merchantable timber. Is not suscept
ible of irrigation from any known
source of water supply, and is of such
character that 640 ucrts are reasonably
required for the support of a family."
The laud covered by an additional
entry must be within a radius of 20
miles from the settler's first entry, and
euirymaii is required to tile oil contig
uous areas which tuny be open to en
try prior to tiling In not-contiguous
laud.
Homesteaders who are living on
their original entries are not requir
ed to establish residence on their ad
ditional entries. When they come to
prove up It will only be necessary for
them to show that they have made
the required permanent improvement.
In case a homesteader finds he 1
within the prescribed radius of 20 mile,
he may. if he see. fit, surrender hi. or
iginal tiling und make a new entry cov
ering 640 acres. The second entry,
however, must be in the same land of
fice district as the first. Homesteaders
who are entitled to make additional -entries
have preferental right to file on
lands for ninety days after the sec
retary of the Interior has designated
the land subject to entry under the
provisions of the bill. In case this
preferential right leads to a conflict
between homesteaders the secretary
of the interior is authorized to make
a division of the land.
The United States reserves all the
coul and other minerals In the land
subject to entry.
At the suggestion of the cuttle
raising Interest, a provision wa. plac
ed In the bill authorizing the secretary
of the Interior to withdraw from en
try, water hoes and other bodies of
water needed or used by the public
for watering stock, lie wa. also auth
orized to withdraw from entry auctt
lands a. might b necessary to estab
lish driveway, needed for use In the
movement of stock to the summer and
winter range or to shipping; points.
He will make rule, and regulation
for the administration of these drive
ways. Rhode Islund - 40,114
