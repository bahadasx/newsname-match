ALLIES TURN
DOWN OFFER
OF GERMANY
(I'nited Dress Leased Wire.)
PARIS, Dec. :iO.—The allies today formally refuse<l to enter
peace negotiations with (lermany without knowing wliut conditions
tlie Teutonic power* luive ... propose.
The allied reply to tlie (.ermaii SSgatSJ pro|Hisals was delivered
to neutral diplomats here this afternoon.
The reply resents (jermany's peace offer and the attempt to
throw on the allies responsibility for the war.
The note handed to the diplomats at 7 o'clock said:
"The allied governments of llelgiiim, France, (.rent Itritain,
Italy, Japan, Montenegro, Portugal, Kussja, Itmmiiiia and Serhia,
united in the defense of the liberties of their peoples in true engage
ment, will not lay down their arms, and have decided collectively
to answer the so-called peace proposal.
"First of all, the allies protest against the enemy's assertion*
attempting to throw on the allies responsibility for the war.
"Also the proclamation of tlie central powers claiming victory.
lli.ili assertions are untrue.
"Kor M months the allies have sustained the war which they
did the utmost to prevent, ami they have showed hy their attacks
their attachment for peace.
"This attachment is just as strong today as in IMI I.
"After tho violations (hy the cent nil powers) mid their engngo
ineiit in war they (the allies) eaniiot end the war at (.ormnny's sug
gestion without any ronilitions with which to ■■pen negotiations.
"The (iceman proposal is not an offer of (leace. The prnposi
■in n|i|»eai's more like a war maneuver.
"As fur as the past in eoiicei'iied, the ((.ormun) note ignores
facts, dates and figures showing that (iermany wanted, provoked and
dei larod the war.
"Al The Hague it was ihe (ionium delegation that refused the
disarmament proposal. In .Inly, MM I, it was Att'tria that declared
war on Serhia.
"The central powtis refused all attempts to stop the conflict;
they icfused Filmland's offer lor a conference; France's offer lor an
Intel national commission, and the czar's arhitratiou proposal.
"Hclglmii was invaded hy the empire which proclaimed thai
treaties were scraps of paiier."

Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet,
Eating her curds and whey.
She picked up The Timet to drive off the bines
With the "Duffs" and "Cynthia Grey."
Along came a spider and sat down beside her;
The lady said never a word.
The snider was vexed, chagrined and perplexed:
If is position was wally absurd!
"I'm beginning to doubt," he said with a pout,
"The truth of the nursery rhyme!"
The maid raised her eyes with a look of surprise,
And said: "Oh, it's you! Don't you know
It's most impolite for a spider to bite
A lady who's reading?" And so—
This comical spider sat right there beside her,
In a mood most chastened and meek,
Looking over her shoulder, the rascal grew bolder,
And perused the "Novel-a-Week!"

SET U. S.
RECORD

PHILADELPHIA, Dee. It. —
History was written for the avia
tion corps of tlie IT. S. army to
day, when a flotilla of aeroplanes
piloted hy army aviators flew
from Hempstead, 1.. 1., to tlie
League Island navy yard here —
a distance of aliout 11.") miles.
Privates Salmon and t'oyle,
who left Hempstead with fcelve
other aviators, shortly bofoft 10
o'clock, were the first to reach
heir. Tliey landed at 11:32.
Both were numb from cold.
Almost before they were lifted
from their aeroplane, T. C. Mill
man landed close alongside. Five
others then came swooping down
at intervals of about four minutes.
Salmon's time for tlie flight
waH one hour and thirty-seven
minutes. The fastest trains re
quire two hours to make the trip,
from New York to Philadelphia.
Fourteen of the country's best
known aviators ascended at
Hempstead for the flight. The
first machine rose at 9:58, the
others followed in rapid succes
sion.
Within two minutes after the
first machine rose from tlie
ground all the aeroplanes were in
the air.
The flight is tho greatest from
a military standpoint ever at
tempted in the U. S. It is ex
pected to prove or disprove the
value of hundreds of appliances
which have been invented for use
on aeroplanes.
Of the 12 starters 10 were
army fliers.
At 10:21 nearly all of the ma
chines, strung out in an even line
like a flock of ducks, had passed
over the military aviation field
at Governor's island. All were
flying at a great height and at
high speed.
The aviators headed out to sea,
sailing above Staten island and
then turning in over New Jersey.
After passing Trenton they lay a
straight course for Philadelphia.
The fliers were all wrapped in
heavy fur clothing, with their
heads encased in huge fur-caps.
The return trip is expected to
start at 10 o'clock tomorrow from
Philadelphia.
The machines carry 90-horse
power motors and 250 gallons or
gasoline. All are Curtiss mili
tary tractors.

Five firms forgot to lock their
store-doors when they went home

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah, Dec.
30.—1n what weird web of fate
has Arline Coldwater, 16, become
entangled?
A grim, whimsical Nemesis has
three timos in the dead of night
sought out the girl in her bed and
two times the hunt has been suc
cessful. Tliere followed a most ter-i
rlfyins experience, the fearsome!
operations being exactly the samel
on both occasions.
All Salt Lake is trying to solve
the riddle of these peculiar attacks.
Escapes Second Time
Recently the girl was awakened
at four in the morning to find the
dark forms of two men at her bed
side.
Pefore she could scream, a
hand closed over her lips. A gag
was placed roughly between her
teeth and bound around her head.
In spite of her si niggles she was
carried to a granary iv the rear of
the Coldwater home.
Then came the intensely fiendish
feature of the mysterious assaull.
The men bound her anjiles, tied
her wrists together with a rope,
throwing the loose end over a
rafter. The rope was tightened
slowly.
The girl was drawn upward un
til her toes barely touched the
floor. The entire procedure was
carried out in silence.
Tho two men looked at each
other, smiled and disappeared.
Four hours later the girl man
aged to work the gag loose. Her
cries attracted her father. She
was hysterical and half conscious
when released.
This was the second visit. A few
nights before the mysterious pair
had attempted to capture her, but
she escaped, her screams arousing
the neighborhood.
Motive a Mystery
A week or so later she endured
a similar experience. Her room
was entered again at four in the
morning. She was awakened by the
men at her bedside. Again a hand
stopped her cries. Again the gag
was put in her mouth.
Then the unscrupulous assail
ants carried her to the granary
and left her hanging by the wrists.
Hours later she once more slip
ped the gag from her mouth. Her
screams attracted a neighbor. She
collapsed when she was cut down.
The polico are puzzled.
Robbery is not the motive of
the attacks. Nothing was touched
in the house except the girl.
The Coldwater home Is now
being carefully guarded.

BE A "YES-SER,"
AN UP-BUILDER
When it all simmers down, it is found the only oppo
sition that amounts to anything toward bringing the
proposed army post to American Lake is furnished by
A FEW CIVIC STANDPATTERS.
Oddly enough, some of these standpatters are union
labor leaders, while others are moss-back members of
the inner circle of the old commercial club whom the
labor leaders profess to despise.
These clique members of the old club always have adopted this same
They used to oppose bringing to Tacoma any new industry that might
become a competitor of any industry in which they were interested.
BUILDING
DOUBLES
IN 1916!
Building operations in Tacoma
more tliun doubled during 1916
over the previous year.
With only five hours left for
issuing permits, tlie city building
inspector's office announced at
noon Saturday tliat the year's to
tal of applications for permission
to erect new building here was
$1,618,981.
This was for l,nri2 buildings.
In 191 Ti the permits totalled
1,216, and were for work amount
ing to $790,421.
With practically the same num
ber of permits during the two
years, construction In llt It; is
more than double that of the pre
vious year, indicating a far better
I grade of work in recent months.
EPIDEMIC
IN LOCAL
ACADEMY
For the second time in less
than 12 months, ■ serious epi
demic of diphtheria has developed
in Aquinas academy, North 12th
and G streets.
City health officers this week
placed the entire school under
strict quarantine.
Fortunately, day pupils are not
forced to remain in the school,
because they were home on Christ
mas vacations when the disease
became manifest.
The teachers, sisters, younger
hoarding students and assistants
about the institution are all un
der lock and key. They number
about 75.
Karller In the year an epidemic
in the Aquinas school cost three
lives and an enforced abandon
ment of studies for several
months.
The renewal of diphtheria has
caused much uneasiness among
physicians and others who have
had the school under surveil
lance.
Three students are ill with
diphtheria in hospitals. Several
students have been found who are
"common carriers" of the diph
theria microbes. They carry the
disease germs about in their
throats, spreading the disease
easily to persons whom they meet,
yet they are not ill themselves,
the doctors say.
Only by the most careful exam
ination of the throats of every
student at Aquinas have the germs
been found In these apparently
well children. Similar examina
tions made during the previous
fatal epidemic failed to bring to
light any common carriers ln the
nation in the health office, because
nation in the health office, ecause
the source of the disease could
not be determined.
After the previous epidemic the
entire building, occupying an en
tiro block, was heremtkally seal
ed, and 1,500 pounds ot sulphuric
fumigation powder was burned In
every corner of th* building.
BY THE EDITOR
They were strong for the status quo.
They wanted to be left alone.
They didn't believe in too much development and growth; they feared pro
gress.
Now a few labor union leaders are joining their ranks. They, t<><>, aro
strong for the atatua quo, they want to be lefl alone, they fear progress.
All of which reminds mr of an Incident my lailiii-in-law t *»1«I me of when ho
lie happens t*> be IT. B. minister to bicuador. Tin- principal port of that
country is Guayaquil, which lias heen one of the woi-st jiest boles in tha world.
Because of Guayaquil's being the nearest port, on the south, to the Panama
canal, it was feared by the U. 8. authorities that ii might menace the health of
The country of Ecuador, as I recall the matter, willingly agit*cd to sanitate
Guayaquil in accordance with the wishes of this country,
Some millions of dollars was to be spent in rebuilding the Guayaquil
wharves, in laying new sewers and in other sanitary precautions,
About the time this decision was reached the chamber of commerce of
Guayaquil got busy.
In long resolutions it was set forth that, whereas ihe merchants then in busi
ness there were largely Immune from the rarious suits of plague that infested
the port, through having survived attacks of it or having been innociilated with
serum, and whereas to sanitate the |>ori would likely cause it to become a health
ful and attractive place of residence, etc. leading to great growth and expan
sion, etc, all of which would possibly attract other merchants, and ruin the
business of aforesaid established merchants, etc., etc., et<-. —but 1 need not fin
ish it out; you catch the drift.
Stand-pattism! Fear! Dread of progress!
We had a few such moss backs in our midst years ago when we voted, as a
school district, on the question of buy in?; for $35,000, the 10 acre site where the
Stadium high school now is situated and the great deserted hotel which became
a high school building. |
I recall how the cry of "extravagance" and "the bond issue will ruin us"
was raised them, just as a few raise it today.
The purchase was one of the best investments ever made by a municipality.
And the army post project will be correspondingly as good a one.
Be a yes-ser. Be a community-builder.
