MARKET REPORT
Kansas City Stock Yards, December
26, 1916. Eight thousand cattle arriv
ed for today's market, and sales were
steady to 10- higher, trading active,
top steers $10.25. Hog receipts were
10,500, market 15 to 20 higher, top
$10.50. There were 7500 sheep and
prices were 10 higher, lambs $13 25,
another new high record.
Beef Cattle The Misssouri steers
brought $10.25, and nine loads of
pulp fed steers from Scottbluff, Ne
braska, first here this season, sold at
$10.10 and $10 20, around 1300 lbs
average. Strictly prime steers, are
quotable at $11.00 or a little better.
Medium to good short fed steers
bring $3.50 to $10.00. Bangs of prices
on beef steers is considerably narrow
er than two or three weeks ago, to
the advantage of the lower pi iced
steers. Far western grass steers have
sold here in the last week at $7.25 to
$8.40. Cows continue - firm, best
around $3.00, medium Cows $6.50 to
$7.75, cutters $5.75 to $6.25, canhers
$5725 to $5 65. A string of Colorado
cows sold today at $6.85 $7.10 and
$7.85, canners $5.25.
Stockers and Feeders. Best grades
have sold steady to strong right along,
but there was some decline last, week
on medium and common stock steers
and stock calves. The market was
strong today on all kinds. Pahban-
die twos weighing 866 lbssoldat $8.25,
a strong price, and medium stock
steers at $7.15 were called higher.
Fleshy feeders find outlet around
$8.00 and common stock steers may
be had around $6.00.
Hogs Packer competition was very
strong today, choice heavy hogs sell
ing to the packers up to $10.50. Medi
um weights sold largely at $10.15 to
$10.45, lights $9.60 to $10.25, bulk of
sales S9.90 to $10.45. Several lots of
Arizona hogs were offered, most of
them pig weights that went to stock
hog buyers at $7.00 to $8.50, a few
weighing 185 lbs at $9.55, and 150 lbs
at $9.10. Average weights are in
creasing, but remain low, 185 lbs
week, which means a lack of good
lard hogs. Eastern killers are buy
ing many of their hogs at Western
markets, a feature that helps keep up
prices, but packers engage in stronger
competition among themselves than
they have at any time in recent
months. Evidently hogs are needed.
Sheep and Lambs Prices continue
to creep upward. Two lots of lambs
sold at $13.25 today, a nev high
record, and numerous lots brought
$13.15, equal to previous high record,
paid last Friday. Yearlings are quot
able u to $11.50, wethers $10.00,
ewes $9.25, all these last three classes
due for more money to put them in
line with lamb prices. High prices
for pelts is a factor in the strong
markets, which makes it more secure
than in former years. Feeding Iambs
are worth $11.50 to $12.00.

J. his should have been a verv sue-1
cessf ul season for the SPUGS but it
is probably true that the high cost of I
Christmas was higher than ever be -fore.
Uncle Heck had a hard time decid
ing what to give for Christmas eggal
or diamonds but finally compromis
ed on -peanuts. What did vou do?
o
L Of course everybody, at least all
normally minded people, likes to be
remembered kindly and takes pleas-1
ure in the receipt of the fact, but I
reilly now, didn't you. receive a lot
of gifts for which you have no fur
ther use things that will . become a I
nuisance within a week or two?
. . . . o
Perhaps it would be kinder to port
the question the other way: Didn't
you give a number of things that will
soon become useless encumbrances?
Mere "junk," fit only to clutter up
the center table for a few days and
then to be stowed away and probably
forgotten?
o
The worst feature of our Christ
mas giving is that those most in
need - and most appreciative receive
the least while those who are well
above want receive expensive gifts
which they are ample able to buy , for
themselves, It they want them.
There are two kinds of useless giving;
simple junk and silly .extra vagence.

DID YOU
Receive money for Christmas? If you aid, put it into something
lasting and at the same time useful; something that you can keep
a lifetime and will be a constant reminder of its donor's generos
ity, such as - - ,
Diamonds and Watches
Rings, Cuff Links, Fobs, Bracelets, Cavalliers and many articles

Mr. and Mrs. R. Haug and children,
of south Trego, were in the city last
Sunday enroute northeast for Lin
coln, Kansas, to spend the holidays.
Of course no one - would think of
sending a Tag doll to a millionaire
nor give a diamond ring to a street
beggar, but things just as inapprop
riate Sometimes happen.
o
Old Si's earliest recollections of
Christmas include the popping of fire
crackers. And why not then as well
as at any other time. '
And the old knocker that he is still
insists that Thanksgiving and Christ
mas come too close together. "
Yes we had a: white Christmas and
the weather was even more unusual
in the matter of temperature. Mon
day morning it was 14 degrees, cloudy,
and a soft south wind which begin on
Sunday continued for almost 48 hours.
At dark on Monday the temperature
had .gone up to 40 degrees; u 9 V- m.
it was 45 and continued to rise until
it reached 49, sometime in the night.
There were flashes of lightning and
a little rain feu, which put an end to
the whiteness of Christmas.. Then
the wind changed to the north west
and the temperature dropped to 4
degrees, and by Wednesday morning
it was four below zero.
What a good thing it is to have
calendar in sight. The unusual se
quence of Saturday Sunday Christ
mas almost caused some folks to lose
track of the days of the week.
o
If all is well that ends well then
the year 1916 might be considered
among the good ones. It stops on
Sunday.
o
Referring again to the subject of
Christmas reminders, perhaps you
received one from some half forgot
ten friend some friend to whom vou
sent no gift nor even a word of greet-
ing. If so, your pleasure in receiving
lastl was -OUD'y great; because it was so
unexpectea, sucn an agreeaoie sur
prise, and because you feel sure that
the spirit which prompted the act
was sincere. But there is another
side another view of the matter.
The extra pleasure is in itseir a re
minder of the ease with which we
forget or neglect our friends who are
separated from us by time and dis
tance. .

A LETTER FROM JAPAN.
Saganoseki, Japan, November 10, 1916.
Mrs. H. E. Moe.
Hays, Kansas.
Dear Gsandmotuek:
I am well and hope this will find
you the same. I would have written
to you when I first came over here
but I mislaid your address and just
found it today, so I am writing you a
short letter.
Your birthday present to me was
fine, and I thank you very much for it
is pretty.
You know 1 started to work in
Loveland about the first of April on
a 258 foot smokestack, and we finish
ed that; then I went to work in the
sugar mill and I worked there about
six weeks, and the smokestack comp
any sent me over here to .complete
the largest-smokestack In the world.
They pay all expenses over and back
and $250 . a month. Japanese monev.
,It is sure some trip, much less, easy
work, short hours and my own boss
and good pay. . The job is to be 567
feet high, and 42 feet at - the bottom
by 26 feet at the top when completed.
It is now 70 feet high and will take
about forty-five more days to finish
it. The company wants me to stay
here after this job is done, but I don't
think I will unless they pay me $400
a month of their money, or $200 a
month U. S. money and all -expenses.
I may stay a little while but I don't
like it here; It is too old fashioned.
It reminds me of what I think the
fifteenth century was.
Well, I am just about 8,G00 miles
from home, just a little too far to
walk. - ;
Say, grandma, if you will send me
Roll's address or send him mine, I
will write to him, and if you will
send him mine he can write to me.
Give him and his family my best
regards.
I will have to close for this time as
I don't know of anything more t09ay;
so goodbye.
With lots of love and kisses.
Your ever loving grandson,
, Harry Kurfess.
