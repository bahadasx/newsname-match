CAMPBELL
AHEAD IN
NSPEGTION
PHOENIX, Ariz., Dec 27. An
analysis of the ballot inspection now
proceeding as a preliminary to a pos
sible contest by Governor Hunt against
T. E. Campbell, governor-elect, today
disclosed a net gain of 27 votes for
Campbell.
These figures include dispuated bal
lots, conceded to the claimant and also
corrected slight errors in the count.
Maricopa county, largest in the state,
will be finished tomorrow. Three
boards of inspectors are now working
on the inspection, which, the court
i thinks, will be concludedby January 8.
1ENTINE
USED AS MODEL IN
DRAFTING ARMY BILL
WASHINGTON, Dec 27. Argen
tina's military system is serving as a
model for the universal service bill
now being drafted by a committee of
the army general staff. Officers fam
iliar with staff opinion said today that
while details had not been completed,
the measure was designed to keep half
a million men under training with
200,000 trained reservists subject to
call. It probably will be three weeks
before the bill and the accompanying
estimates of costs are ready for sut
mission to the secietary cf war.
Secretary Baker has not said
whether he would jip'-ove or disa.j
jaove it The feature of the sta : bil!
will be the provision for one year of
intensive military instruction for all
youths, subject to its terms. It is ex
pected exemptions due to physical dis
qualification and for other reasons, in
cluding possibly The conscription cf
certain men for work in in-lustral
plants necessarj in war times, wo-M
leave available for army trainla, !e
tween 450,000 and 500,000 if the
1.000,000 boys who reach the aire of
18 each year.
In fixing upon a year as the min
imum time for training the general
staff has followed the theory that the
"United States seeks to provide for
only an army of defense. It has been
stated to the house committee by Ma
jor General Hugh L. Scott that al
though European nations give every
soldier at least two years of hard work
before turning him into the reserve,
because of the geographical position
of the country, a year will suffice here.
The argument advanced to support
this view was that there would be
sufficient time to give finishing touches
to the military education of reservists
after war had broken out and before
invading expeditions could be leaded
in force.
In a broad way the outline of the
general staff continental army plan
of last year would be followed in dis
tributing tactical units of the reserve
into 19 infantry and 6 cavalry, divi
sions. Reservists would be liable for
two years' service in this force before
passing into the unorganized reserve.
The result when the system had
been in operation a number of years,
would be to give 500,000 men under
arms and in process of training, a mil
lion more trained, equipped, organized
and ready for immediate muster as
first line troops and behind there the
unorganized but trained reserve num
bering more than 1,500,000. This is
the basis on which estimates of cost
will be made by the general staff com
mittee. VISITING HER PARENTS
DURING HOLIDAY SEASON
(From Thursday Dally Miner.)
Miss Althea Perry, the talented
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Perry,
is spending the holiday season with
her parents. Miss Perry, who is a
graduate of Stanford university with
the degree of juris doctor, is taking a
post graduate course at the Universi
ty of California which she will shortly
complete. She will then enter the of
fice of a prominent San Francisco at
torney in the practice of her profes
si on.
ASSESSED $1 POUND
FOR BEATING WIFE
PUEBLO, Colo., Dec 28.
"What do you weigh?" Judge
R. A. Crossman asked Mrs. James
Arris in police court today. Mr.
Arris was accused of beating his
wife.
"One hundred pounds," the wo
man answered.
"You are fined $100," said the
magistrate to Arris, "a dollar a
pound."
Arris paid.
(From Thursday's Dully Miner.)
R. C. Jacobson and two other gen
tlemen motored to the Colorado river
at Griggs' ferry Sunday last and se
cured many photographs of the stream
at that point and at the mouth of the
Grand Canyon. This is the part of the
river along which Judge M. W. Mus-
grove and associates have located
many bars bearing gold.
Mr. Jacobson stated that while the
wind blew at a lively gait and some
rain fell they enjoyed the outing. He
related a hunting story that puts Ir
win Cobb up against it The boys
carried with them a .22 rifle, and when
they practiced shooting at a rock the
gun worked beautifully, but when
game hove in sight it got the "buck"
fever and "choked" up. Finally a big
goose hove in sight on the river and
one of the boys succeeded in having
a bullet pass the gun muzzle in flight
toward and against the fowl, but it
glanced off as though it had encoun
tered an armor-plate caterpillar.
IN DE LUKE EDITION
(From Chloride Herald)
Within a few days a little gray fliv
ver will be seen flitting and flivering
hither and thither in and about our
magnetic mineral center.
G. B. Lindsley, now the feature rep
resentative of the Mohave County and
Daily Miner, has an especially elabor
ate task in the production of "The Mo
have County De Luxe Edition of 1917,
and the little gray Ford above re
ferred to is acting as one of his
bowers as a call is made on each and
every active property, whether mining
or otherwise, in the county necessitat
ing its use.
This De Luxe Edition is as its name
implies, one indeed, as it will contain
a pictorial review, as' well as editorial,
of everything of interest to everyone
with interest in our ever interesting
and progressive county. Mr. Lindley
states that this book will contain from
60 to 80 pages, magazine size, with
magazine paper embellished in an ar
tistic way with art layouts and pen
sketches of prominent people drawn
by Jack Box, famous facial delineator
and illustrator, from New York.
As the book far surpasses any ever
attempted in Arizona to date and will
do our county a world of good, it
seems in order that every live wire
should attach theirselves to the idea
of sending a few sparks into this
boosting dynamo helping to charge it
with unlimited power for pubucity
good by that assistance and by send
ing through the mail a hot shot of in
formation into the world about Mo
have County and its mineral wealth.
"The Mineral Kingdom" is the slo
gan used on the title page, and this
page contains a fine picture, with oth
ers, of Chloride, and as a goodly por
tion of the inside pages will be given
to the portraying of Chloride as a
strong example of our leading mining
camps, it would seem that our imme
diate locality will profit by the sparks
of information sent out by the
Mohave County and Daily Miner spe
cial publicity dynamo, the De Luxe
Edition.
BURIED AT PASADENA
(From Thursday's Dally Miner.)
The funeral of the mother of H. D,
Lore, who died recently took place in
Pasadena, Calif., yesterday. Mr. Lore
was called from here and was present
at the obsequies.
H. D. Lore, who was called to Cali
fornia several days ago by the death
of his mother, returned from Pasa
dena yesterday morning.

By WILLIAM P. DeWOLF
PRESCOTT, Ariz., Dec. 26. Cop
per, gold, silver, tungsten, lead and
zinc to the value of $32,202,126 were
produced in Yavapai county during the
year 1916. The table of classifica
tion and value follows:
Copper, 108,629,600 pounds, value,
$27,157;400.
Gold, 145,664 ounces, value, $2,567,
624. Placer gold, 4000 ounces, value, $60,
000. Silver, 3,686,029 ounces, value, $2,
297402. Lead and zinc concentrates, $100,
000. Tungsten, $20,000.
Grand total, $32,202,126.
The total value of the ores treated
is based upon copper at 2 5cents per
pound; gold reclaimed at smelters at
$19 per ounce; gold taken from placers
at $15 per ounce, and silver, 624 cents
per ounce. The values placed on lead
and zinc concentrates and tungsten
are estimates, and apply only to ship
ments made to smelting points outside
of Yavapai county.
Gold and Silver are what might be
not inaptly termed bi-products of the
ores of this county to a considerable
extent particularly of the copper ores
of the Verde district and elsewhere
and in compiling the production fig
ures for 1916 their presence in all of
the base ores has been recognized.
That prosperity has followed the
peripheries of the mine, mill and
smelter circles of this county during
the year just rounding out is due to1
(From Chlcrlde Section Dally Miner)
Copper ore that is little short of be
ing solid metal and carrying, in ad
dition, high values in silver, was
broken down by the last round of shots
in the tunnel being driven on the Cop
per Hill property of the Hughes Ari
zona Copper company. The ledge ex
tends fee full width of the face and,
although broken wide purposely, failed
to disclose the width of the vein. The
tunnel is being driven on the smaller
of two veins that run the length of
the Hughes Arizona company's claim,
and is now in to a depth of more than
300 feet. Ore has been encountered
right along, but the strike resulting
from this week's work proves the as
FRANCE REFUSES TO
RATIFY COMPROMISE
OF TIEN Tl DISPUTE
PEKIN, Dec 29. The French gov
ernment, it is announced, has refused
to ratify the proposed compromise set
tlement of the Tien Tsin concession
dispute.
Numerous conferences between Dr.
Wu Ting Fang, Chinese foreign min
ister, and Count de Martel, French
charge d'affaires, a PeHn dispatch on
December 16 announced, had resulted
in a tentative compromise settlement
of the Tien Tsin concession dispute.
This compromise, it was said, pro
vided for restoration by the French
to China of the territory in question
and the return of Chinese policemen.
China, for her part, agreed to make
the district an international settle
ment, open to all the treaty powers.
China also was to promise to make
an effort to check anti-French boy
cott demonstrations at Tien Tsin.
William 0Dea came in from the
Pilgrim yesterday to attend to busi
ness affairs. He reports that his
brother, Frank, is slowly recovering
from illness, but that it will be a long
time before he can again resume work.

MILLION CLAUD
concerted mining effort, and to the
conservative publicity accorded the
local mining industry in the mining
and general news press of the state
and country. That results have jus
tified the mining and publicity efforts
is demonstrated by the county's min
eral production, by the large amount
of capital invested here during the
year and. by the extensive mining,
milling and smelting operations now
in force.
At the outset of the year 1916 min
ing, milling and smelting operations
were by no means so general as at
present. With the passing of the
months, however, Yavapai county
caught its stride in the march of min
ing and general business prosperity
that is sweeping over Arizona, and be
came a banner-bearing county among
the counties of a state that stands well
to the fore in mining and investment
importance. The good work accom
plished during 1916 is but a marker
for that contemplated during 1917 by
the men who are establishing the
county's mining industry on a copper-
bottomed base. The plans for the
coming year include enlarged mining,
milling and smelting operations and
an increase of at least one-third in
mineral production over the record
made the current year.
The United Verde and the United
Verde Extension mines are a good pair
to draw to in the local mining game.
That is to say, they offer an incentive
for concentrated effort without which
no game is either interesting or remu
nerative. The men who "played" the

time ago examined the property to the
effect that the main body of ore would
be encountered by the tunnel at a
depth approximating 300 feet.
tl is the intention of the company
to run the present tunnel deeper and
then to crosscut to the company's
main vein, which- parallels the smaller
vein at present being followed.
No assays had been made from the
face of the tunnel where it now is up
to the time of going to press, but de
terminations made from samples
taken several days ago showed values
as high as $296.
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
TO SPEND WINTER HERE
Mr. and Mrs. R. A. Hill and daugh
ter of Altadcna, Cal., arrived in King
man Thursday to spend the winter.
Mr. and Mrs. Hill are aunt and uncle
of Mrs. G. R. Franklin. They have
leased the upper fiat of J. B. Wright's
apartments. Mr. Hill has large prop
erty interests in southern California
among which are five or six orange
groves, a dairy ranch or two and other
holdings. He was formerly Pacific
Coast manager of the"' Armour Fer
tilizer company. Mr. Hill has spent
some time here before and considers
this climate excellent.
WALKER RESIDENCE AT
HACKBERRY IS DESTROYED
(From Saturday's Dally Miner)
Cleve Walker, an employee of the
Santa Fe railroad at Hackberry re
turned to his home last evening from
a visit here to find his house in ashes.
Nothing was saved from the flames
and Mr. Walker states that his sole
possessions now are a wife, a dog and
a automobile. The fire is presumed
to have been caused by a defective flue.
Miss Wright, the school teacher at
Hackberry who was a border at the
Walker home, also suffered the loss of
over $100 in cash and all of her wear
ing apparel.
CALEXICO JEWELER
GETS "LOADED" CIGAR
CALEXICO, Cal., Dec 28.
Charles E. Campbell, a jeweler of
this city, received today one of
the "loaded" cigars mailed at
Goffs, Cal. Campbell dissected
the cigar bomb and found it con
tained black powder and a cap.
Of 25 of the bombs mailed on a
train, nine have been accounted
for by postal inspectors.
READ TAKES OVER
THE 1ST STAR
Another important mining property
on the west side of town has been sold,
making the third sale in that vicinity
inside of 10 days. The last property
to go was the West Star group, the
property of Frank Meredith, which
was taken over by Harold J. Read. Mr.
Read recently was successful in finan
cing the Molly Gibson-Chloride, and
intends devoting his entire attention to
the making of a mine of the West
Star.
The West tSar lies directly between
the famous old Tintlc and the Tuck
aho, both early day producers with a
high record. The Tintic vein has been
exposed on the West Star by a 40
foot vertical shaft and a 20-foot in
cline. There were no indications of
the existence of the vein on the sur
face, and MrMeredith sank the shaft
through 40 feet of wash before drop
ping onton the vein, which proved to
be six feet in width and in place. It
crosses the West Star ground and is
opened on Tuckaho ground by several
shafts.
AT ELKS' THEATRE
(From Thursday's Dally Miner.)
That the Elks' Theatre is the most
popular playhouse in northern Ariz
ona is an established fact. One rea
son therefor is that Manager Lang
never overlooks an opportunity to give
his patrons the best that can be ob-i
tained in the way of productions. His !
latest innovation is the installation of
a shadow box which extends twelve
fee back on the stage.
The device relieves all eye strain
and makes the pictures more clear
and softens the light rays. . is the
last word in the moving picture busi
ness. With it is used a special lense.
The equipment is exactly the same as
used by "The Birth of a Nation" com
pany and cost Manager Lang over
$200 to install.
BODY OF W. E. MORONEY
TAKEN EAST FOR BURIAL
(From Thursday's Daily Miner.)
There will be no funeral service for
W. E. Moroney this morning on ac
count of a change in the original fun
eral plans. His body was taken east
last night on train No. 2. Many
members of the local lodge of Elks
were present to assist the deceased's
sisters, who accompanied the body.
Mrs. J. S. Daniels came down from
Hackberrv yesterday and spent the
night in town. Mrs. Daniels is the
justice of the peace elect of Hackberry
precinct and is here attending to the
filing of her bond and other business
preparatory to her taking office the
first of the year.
PROSPECTORS SHOULD
LOOK FOR TEN ORES
One of the most important metals
that so far has not been found in
quantity in the United States is tin.
An effort has been made to produce
tin in Dakota and California, but with
small success. It is probable that tin
ores will eventually be found in this
country and it is up to the prospector
to hunt it out The finder of a pro
ducing tin mine can name his own
price for it and the United States will
give him a medal. As Mohave coun
ty is really the mother county for
metals the Miner expects to hear of
a find of tin before the year 1917
wanes.
COPPER TO
i
AFTER WAR
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah, Dec 26.
U. S. G. Todd, a mining engineer of
Los Angeles, who has recently been
looking over the booming copper
camps of Arizona, is in the city. He
gives it as his opinion that the great
boom in copper is a permanent propo
sition and bases this statement upon
the fact that the 1917 production has
practically been contracted.
"Notwithstanding that great de
mand for copper has, in a" measure,
been created by the European war,"
he says, "should the war cease within
six months the reconstruction and the
spreading out of the use3 of copper
will maintain the price for at least
three years to come. Of course, the
boom in all of the baser metals has
been largely created by the war, and
it is the one great element which is
now centering capital upon the mining
field.
"Arizona is experiencing one of the
greatest booms in mining it has ever
had. Take the great copper camps of
Bisbee, Jerome and Chloride and you
will find veritable beehives. In fact,
the population of Chloride has more
than trebled in six months."
It is of the future of Chloride that
Mr. Todd speaks most enthusiastically.
He is interested in the Hughes Ari
zona Copper company that has recent
ly been organized and is now develop
ing the Copper Hill and Alma prop
erties. "Mr. John B. Hughes, a gentleman
who has been in Chloride and made a
thorough study of the ores and prop
erties of that camp since 1903, is the
president of the company. The work
is being carried on steadily and a dis
play of the ores that have been en
countered in the ore shoot in the work
ings of the property, which is a tun
nel now in 310 feet, are on display in
Salt Lake and Los Angeles.'
L
IDAHO LEGISLATURE
BOISE, Idaho, Dec 27. The Demo
cratic party, for the first time in four
teen years, has control of both
branches of the Idaho legislature
which convenes January 8, with the
re-election of Governor Moses Alex
ander, Democrat, and the election of
Ernes L. Parker, Democrat, as Lieu
tenant Governor, the legislative pro
gram of that party will, apparently,
have clear sailing.
C. S. Moody, adjutant general of
the state and one of the few mem
bers elect, who has seen previous ser
vice, is a candidate for speaker of the
house. The house is composed of 36
Democrats and 19 Republicans and the
senate 21 Democrats and 16 Repub
licans. As a result of the Democratic land
slide in the state few of the former
legislative leaders will participate in
the coming session. Peter G. John
son, of Blackfoot, for many years Re
publican floor leader in the house was
re-elected and will have no opposition
for that honor.
A brief session, with adjournment
before the 60-day limit, something
that has never before taken place in
Idaho, is the Democratic program.
Little legislation of importance is
proposed. Revision of the election
laws, with the probable doingaway
with party symbols on the ballot, will
be one of the most important tasks
confronting the legislature. Economy
and tax reduction will be the slogan
of the majority party.
Country Treasurer Thomas Devine,
who with his son, Thomas, jr., took
the Mohave county ballots to Phoenix,
returned from the capital city yester
day morning. Mr. Devine reports that
practically nothing can be learned of
the results so far attained in the gov
ernorship recount, but that each side
appear to be confident of winning.
C. G. Rice and wife of Mineral Park
are visitors in town.
