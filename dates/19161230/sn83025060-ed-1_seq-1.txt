Washington, D. C. In shaping
national legislation ono vote in Ala
bam, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Louisiana, Mississippi, South
Carolina, or Virginia is worth as
much as five votes cat in Connec
ticut, New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan,
Iowa, New Mexico or Idaho.
The eight southern states en
umerated casta total of 511,199
votea for the election to members
to sit in tho Sixty-fourth Congress
Tnis makes an average of 7,745
votes to each district, the entire
number of districts returning Gl
Democrats, one Republican and
one Progressive.
For the seven northern States
mentioned, the total vote at the
same time wjis 2 5S7.102, or ai
average of 9,'J03 vo'ra for each
district, r turning r,0 Republicans
and 10 Democrats. Thus slightly
over half a million s lUlhcrn votert
have 6G spokesmen in the House
of Representatives, whoreass it ic
quired more than two nnd a half
million northern voters to secure
equal representation. The inequali
ty in voting power is the. outcome
q course, of a basis of total popu
lation forming the several southern
Congressional Dist. where thoNcg'o
is counted in, but his vote exclud
ed. How long must this inequali
ty continue? Are the North cn,d
the Republican party
submit indefinitely to
tion of affairs?
In religion than a moral propuKanda or
n. civic loform nnd tho spirit of intolor-
nnco on either Hldo ahould not be cul
tivated among Christiana to carry an
election.

Moborly (Mo.) Monitor.
Tho nbovo is from tho pen of Frank
Rothwoll, a consistent and In time
past an nctlvo working momber tae
Dnptlst church. It clearly outlines the
condition in noma ot the churches ot
this cltv nt tho nrosont time. Men
may be willing to tnko spiritual ad
vlco from tho ministers but thoy will
not take from them political advice
siiL'ar coated with a thin veneer of
roliRion. it would bo well If church
pastora would rocognlzo that matura

statements aro not going to bo taken

Whllo a thirsty throng looked on

oauallv as "dry" doputy ttiioriitB yes
terduy aftornoon emptied COi quarts
of ryo lbmor Into a basin on the sec
ond floor of tho courtuouso wnnin
smelling dlstnnco of Judge Ben Hill's
court room. Tho Hnuor had been seise
In n number ot raids, and ordered de
stroyed. Tho odor normeatcd tho ontire floor.
Judgo uoll was holding court In the
trial of nn alleged dynamiter. His
audionco Btiddenly began to tbln out,
Tho oratory of Frank Hoopor, counsel
for tho dofouso, was Insufficient to
copo with tho fragrance that waited
across tho hall from tho basin that
was having Ita thirst slaked with
enough alcohol to Inebriate Vltla'a
young army.
Tho nudlcnco was proaontly trans
ferred, almost In whole, from the ccuirt
