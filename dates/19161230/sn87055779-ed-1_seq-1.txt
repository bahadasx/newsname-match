VERDUN IS AGAIN
SCENE OF BATTLE
Germans Attempting to Gain
Dominating Positions
Along the Meuse.
International News Service:
LONDON. Dec. 0. The scene of
the winter's hardest fiphtiriK on tin
western front has been shifted from
the Js'ommo sector to Verdun. Using
picked troops transported from the
Somme battle arena, the Germans
have launched a tremendous otTens
ive movement on the western side of
the Meuse.
It is the evident intention of the
German crown prince to attempt to
j.ain dominating positions on the left
bcnk of the Meuse in order to put
the recently won Trench positions
on the eastern side of the Meuse
under a cross ;re from German
litis.
There was violent cannonading on
both sides of the Meuse river last
night, followed with infantry at
tacks. The Germans are trying to extend
their popitlon.-t around Hill No. T.04,
find on the southern slopes of Mort
Homme (Dead Man hill), but their
efforts were met with powerful
I-'rtnch counter attacks.
It is now evident that the French'
had learned of the German plans for
a new drive on the Verdun front and
shifted troops there to meet it. This
accounts for the announcement that
the Uritish have taken over more of
tlu jsotnme line.
The Uritish war other, in a state
ment issued early today, reported a
successful infantry attack against
German trenches east of I.esars and
bombardments along the northern
end of the Nomine front. It admits
tue loss of an aeroplane.

Hope to Which the Admin

For a Solution.

WASHINGTON. Dec. CO. The
"big four" railroad brotherhoods arc
preparing again to use the "big
stick. wielded with such signal suc
cess over congress last August, when
the Adamson eight-hour law was
jammed through in record time.
From trustworthy sources here it
was stated positively today that
when the time comes, if the 400.000
members of the brotherhoods vote a
general strike to combat the refusal
of the railroads to put tne vuamoo
law into effect pending decision by
the supreme court on its constitu
tionality, the tactics of last August
will be used.
This would mean that a general
strike order would go out. to go into
effect automatically unless a code
message, known only to the brother
hood heads, was Hashed to the local
chairmen of the brotherhoods to
stop the impending strike.
The tacit promise that no strike
would be called for two months at
least is the ray of hope to which the
administration is looking for a solu- t
tion of the irritating problem. While J
no accurate estimate can
be made
of the action of the supreme court,
department of justice ollicials aro
confident that a decision on the con
stitutionality of the Adamson law
will be handed down before that
time.
The administration plans to bring
all possible pressure to bear to force

for the compulsory arbitration of
dilhculties between railroads and
their employes, keeping them at
their jobs and forbidding lockouts!

by the brotherhoods has been prom
