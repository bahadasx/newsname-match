Copy of Communication Sent
to Wilson; American Con
ferees to Meet Tuesday to
Consider Situation,
Y HORN, NO JOURNAL IRICIAL LIAIID VASRIl
Washington, Dec 2!l. Continuation
of the conferences of the Mexican
American joint commission, without
regard to tho question of withdraw
in? American troops from Mexico, is
proposed by General Carrnnza in his
message refusing to ratify the Atlan
tic City protocol. Coupled with this
suggestion, however, is a new propo
sal for the recall of the Pershing expe
dition, and a declaration that such ac
tion by the United States would per
mit adjustment of all remaining
questions "within a week."
There were indications tonight that
tlie American members of the com
mission might bo disposed to comply
with the request for further confer
ences, on the gound that the United
States had nothing to lose by doing
so. It was officially stated that noth
ing yet had occurred to alter the pol
icy of the administration toward Mex
ico, and it is generally ' understood
that so long as northern Mexico is in
its present unsettled state, Pershing's
men will stay where they ure.
A study of the Carranza communi
cation was sent to President Wilson.
Secretary Luna communicated with
Dr. J. It, Mott and Judge George
Gray, the other members of the
American commission, and then an
nounced that they would meet here
Tuesday to determine whether fur
ther conferences shall be held.
Would Lay Aside Protocol.
Carranza points out in his reply
that there was nothing In the corre
spondence that led to tho creation of
the commission, nor in the cereiien
tials and Instructions delivered to its
members that would preclude discus
sion of the many other subjects which
the commission made incidental U
those agreed upon in the protocol.
In effect, he suggests that the proto
col be laid aside for the present and
the work of the commission bo laid
along fresh channels.
Although the conditions Imposed
for withdrawal of the troops were
not to his liking, he attempted to
make it clear that his chief objection
to ratifying the document was not
based on the conditions, but on the
fact that he could not conscientiously
sign anything which would place him
in the position of having appeared to
sanction even for a brief time tho
presence in Mexico of federal troops.

Berlin, Dec. L'9 (by Wireless to Say
vllle.) KfTjtn newspaliers publish
numerous dispatches and comment at
length on the recent discussions and
other activities of socialist committees i
and congresses in other European
countries. Tho newspapers report,
says the Overseas News agency, that
while Great Britain permitted dele-
j gates of the Danish labor party to
visit England, the French minister ai
Copenhagen refused to give three
Scandinavian delegates passports for
France, in order to prevent the
French socialists from getting Into
touch with the Scandinavians and
from receiving neutral information.
Tho Vorwaerts, commenting on the
meeting of the French socialists, says:
"The reports of tlie TT,iv..rr"'Wn,7
concerning the French convention ap
pear very much adulterated. They
apparently contain nothing except
what Is agreeable to the French gov-
effect that an essential increase of:
peaceful tendencies has taken place.
A resolution was proposed to the
meeting, urging that the government
should not decline peace proposals on
principle, but to examine the situation
recently created conscientiously."
After discussing the resolutions of
the French socialist convention, the
Vorwaerts refers to the interest
shown there concerning the "German
peace conditions," and adds:
"If these were known in France,
then the French people would know
that this war, as a war of defense for
the existence and honor of France,
has terminated and that it can only be
