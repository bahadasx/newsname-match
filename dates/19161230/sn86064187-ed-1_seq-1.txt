DANIELS URGES
DRASTIC LAW ON
SHIP BUILDING
Preference to Navy Work
Would Be Prescribed,
WASHINGTON. Dec. JO A drastic
proposal designed to furnish authority
under whiih private manufacturers or
shipbuilders would be compelled to
give preference to navy work has been
submitted to Secretary,', Daniels to the
house naval committee for inrlusion in
the 1I8 naval approbation bill, con
sideration of which will he resumed
next week. It provides that where fon-
Iracts or orders have been placed for
ships or munitions or matenaj enter
ing into the construction of ships, the
secretary may require the fulfilment of
the work ahead of any undertaking for
private enterprise.
Could Takt Over Plant
Should the contractor fail to comply
through neglect, delay or refusal, the
secretary would he aiithnriird In take
over the plant and complete the work,
charging the contractor with all costs
in excess of the stipulated contract
price.
Mr. Daniels indicated in his annual
report the difficulties encountered by
the department in hurrying its build
ing program and said the enormous
amount of new construction authoriied
required some remedial legislation.
Total of 1400,000,000.
The item is one of the few cases
of new legislation included in the navy
bill and Chairman Padgett of the house
committee expects to have it ready by
the middle of January despite the fad
that it carries a 4otal of nearly $410,.
000,000. He believed his committee
will recommend the 1918 construction
program proposed by Secretary Dan
iels, which includes three 42.000 ton
battleships, one battle cruiser and about
one-half of the remainder of the three
year program in smaller ships.

Two Candidates.
The fight for president pro tempore
of the senate was virtually settled this

caucus and not pledging support to any
one man was made today hy Represen
tative Everett Petry of Alius, who is
Nesbitt's only active opponent for
speaker of the house of representatives.
Petry Hopeful.
Mr. Tetry declared his chances were
"reasonably good" and despite the
clearly apparent tide of sentiment
toward Nesbitt said he had no inten
tion "just now" of withdrawing, but
would not rarry the fight to the floor
of the caucus "unless I think I can win."
Representative Bert Hodges of Ok
mulgee and Representative Tom C.
Waldrep of Shawnee, who up until Fri
day niglif.were regarded as the most
formidable candidates in the race, with
drew and jumped into the Ne'sbitt camp.

two other candidates, joined the Neshit:
forces Friday .morning

Berlin Report Says New Peace
Note Sent to Belligerents by
President, But Never Has
.Been Delivered.
PROBABLY EXPLANATION
Unfriendly Comment of For
eign Press on First Note
Reason for Second.
BERLIN, Dec. 30. It has been
learned that a few dayt ago Presi
dent Wilson tent a second note,
eiptanatory of the first, to the
central poweit and entente aationa.
This note hat not been oretented.
The reason for the withholding
of the second note is said to be
that the German reply, received in
the interim showed that the Ger
man government had not been in
fluenced by the "miteonceptiont re
garding the purpose and aims of
Pretident Wilton's step which an
Unfriendly prett in both campt at

WASHINGTON, Dec. JO - Serre

ior peace terms, ne tnmcateil that un
der the recent policy of silence adopted
bv President Wilson and himselt in
the peace negotiations, he would make
no statement either affirming or deny

misunderstanding might arise in .the
popular mind, but it is held that th

Explanatory Statements.
Other officials,' however, said they
were sure no tecond note had been
sent and that the Berlin dispatches re
ferred to the two statements by Secre
tary Lansing issued the day after the
dispatch of the original note was an
nounced. Secretary Lansing also refused to in
dicate whether he thought the Berlin
report might have arisen ort of the
sending abroad of the information of
American diplomats of his two state
ments authorized the day the note was
published. It is known that these state
ments were transmitted to the American
diplomats to acquaint them fully with
what had taken plaw here, but that
they were not instructed to present them
