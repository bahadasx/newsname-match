Don't Get jo a Sweat
over the coal question. Keep
cool and buy the kiDd of coal
that will keep you warm with
the fewest .trips to the cellar.
Try our coal this year. You'll
find it goes so much farther than
ordinary fuel that when warm
weather comes around you'll have
a nice.little pile left to start]the
next season on. That, proves it's
coal economy to buy here.
