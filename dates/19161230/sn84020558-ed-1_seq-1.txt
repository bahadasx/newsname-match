Sixth Annual Bargain
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Dec. 29. Continua
tion of the conferences of the Mexican
Americim Joint commission, without
regard to the question of withdrawing
American troops from Mexico, is pro
posed by General Carranza in his mes
sage refusing to ratify the Atlantic
City protoVol. Coupled with this sug
gestion, however, is a new appeal for
recall of the Pershing expedition and
a declaration that such action by the
l'nited States would permit adjust
ment of all remaining questions "with
in a week."
There were indications tonight that
the American members of the com
mission might be disposec to comply
with the request for further confer
ences on the ground that the United
States had nothing to lose by doing so.
It was officially stated that nothing
yet had occurred to alter the policy of
the administration toward Mexico and
it is generally understood that so long
as northern Mexico is in its present
unsettled state Pershing's men will
stay where they are.
A copy of the Carranza communica
tion was sent to President Wilson.
Secretary Lane communicated with Dr.
.1. K Mott and Judge George Gray, the
other members of the American com
mission, and then announced that they
would meet here Tuesday to determine
whether further conferences shall be
held.
Carranza points out in his reply that
there was nothing in the correspon
dence that led to the creation of the
commission nor in the credentials ar.d
instructions delivered to its members
that would preclude consideration of
the many other subjects which the
commission made incidental to those
agreed upon in the protocol. In effect
he suggests that the protocol be laid
aside tor the present and the work of
the commission be directed alotig.f reah
channels.
Although the conditions imposed for
withdrawal of the troops were nit to
his liking, he attempted to make It
clear that his chief objection to ratify
ing the document was not based upon
the conditions, but on the fact that he
could not conscientiously sign anything
which would place him in the position
of having appeared to sanction even
for a brief time the presence in Mexico
of foreign troops.
To Catch Snipers
EL PASO, Dec. 29. General .lose
Murguia. commandant at Juarez, sent
a detachment of Carranza soldiers to
a point opposite the Kentucky guard
outpost at Hart's Mill on the western
edge of El I'aso, with Instructions to
entrench themselves and try to dis
cover who has been guilty .of sniping at
the Americans, it was officially an
nounced in Juarez lute today. The
trenches. General Murguia explained,
are for purely defensive purposes, so
that the men would not be tempted to
answer back if firing started. Their
duty will be to apprehend any Mex can
civilians caught shooting across the
Rio Grande.
Refuso to Surrender
DOUGLAS, Dec. 29 The Yaqui In
dian tribe, two thousand of which, in
cluding women and children, are en
camped at Lencho, Sonora, has def
initely refused to surrender its arms
and ammunition to the Cassanza gov
ernment, according to arrivals here
today. The refusal was made known
through Mori, the tribal chief, it was
stated
The Mexican government will con
tinue negotiations in an effort to bring
about this end in a peacable manner,
if possible, it was reported, as without
surrender of arms on the part of the
Indians the program of division of
lands and establishment of the tribe
around the village of Datum cannot be
carried out. " (

Villa Works Ruse
Successfully In
Attack on Torreon
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
EL PASO, Dec. 29. Villa troops, al
though expected to attack, took Tor
reon by surprise through a ruse on
December 21, according to details
reaching the border tonight. Hy false
dispatches to the railway office in Tor
reon, the rebels are said to have made
the Carranza garrison believe a train
entering the city bore reinforcements
from General Murguia. Hut instead,
it carried Villa troops who quietly dis
embarked then rushed the town, while
the garrison retired.
An American in El Paso learned
through a letter that General Luis
Herrera, commanding the Torreon gar
rison, had information that a Villa
attack was likely and had given orders
to his troops to retire. Hut, not sus
pecting an attack at that time, he was
having a sociable drink in a cafe with
several members of his stuff when the
place was rushed by a squad of rebels.
General Herrera and his companions
were killed in the fray.
It was by means of false messages
to the railway office that Villa and
his army, disguised as a train'of coal,
entered and captured Juarez in
November, 1913.

' NEW YORK, Dec, 29. Special cir
culars putting up to the 400,000 mem
bers responsibility for the next step
to be taken by the railroad brother
hoods in their controversy with the
railroads over the application and in
terpretation of the Adamson act, were
sent broadcast by teleffraph after a
conference of the four brotherhtmd
chiefs here today.'
Announcement of the action taken
was made by William G. Lee, presi
dent of the Brotherhood of Railroad
Trainmen, prior to his departure for
the west. He was accompanied by
the other brotherhood whose confer
ence with the railway managers yes
terday resulted in a disagreement.
Earlier In the day the four chiefs
issued a somewhat crytic statement
over their signatures declaring that
the attitude of th railroads threat
ened to wipe out the benefits that
should accrue to the men from the
passage of the Adamson act and as-
sir;ing that for that reason ' the entire
situation is to be placed before the
membership.
The chiefs refused to say whether
the action was a veiled threat of an
other strike vote such as brought
about the eight-hour day legislation.
The statement follows:
"While meeting with President Wil
son last August, at his insistence, our
committee waived their request for
time and a half for overtime, which
was fully 50 per cent of their original
demand, and at the suggestion of the
president accepted his proposition,
which was:
"'Concession of the eight-hour day.
" 'Postponment of the other demand;
as to the payment for overtime, and
the counter suggestion of the railway
managers

ion or body of men, appointed by the
president, to observe, investigate and
report upon these concessions without
recommendation.
"'Then such action upon the facts
as the parties of the present contro
versy may think best.'
"Our men believed, in so .doing, they
would secure the eight-hour basic day
at once, but the enactment of the
Adamson eight-hour law, effective
January 1, 1117, made it necessary for
them to wait patiently until that time,
to find later that the railroad com
panies instituted injunction proceed
ings against the government's en
forcement of the eight-hour law, and
at this time the entire matter is in
litigation, such litigation making it
impossible for the specal committee,
appointed by the president, as pro
vided for in the law, to proceed with
their investigation January 1, anit the

WASHINGTON, Dec. 29. The direc
tors of the American Peace society
decided today to call an open meeting
of peace workers to be held here Jan
uary 20 for the purpose of considering
a definite program for international re
organisation designed to secure a last
ing peace as soon as the preesnt war is
over.
Some modification of it is expected
to be adopted by those in favor of per
manent peace secured by international
legislatures, courts and public opinion
as opposed to those who are supporting
tho suggestion of an international
force. N
Between these two principles it has
been officially stated, the administra
tion has not committed itself. Presi
dent Wilson has been commonly sup
posed to support the program of the'
League to Enforce "Peace, having spok
en at its meetings here several months
ago and having said in some of nin
campaign speeches that "tho moral
force, not only, but the physical forte,"
of this country should be used to guar
antee peace. Recently, however, it has
been stated that the president is not
definitely committed to that program
and is open to suggestion along other
lines.
The program suggested by Dr. Scott
calls first for regular stated meetings
of The Hague conferences to frame
world laws to 6e referred to the states
for ratification, and for a permanent
committee of the ambassadors resident

GERMAN ALLIES
DRIVE FORWARD
ON MI FRONTS
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
Pressing in upon southern Moldavia
from tkree sides, apparently with all
their vigor, the forces of the central
powers are making progress against
stiff resistance. On the Transylvanian
Moldavian frontier, in the region north
of Rimnik-Sarat and in the Dobrudja
j opposite P.raa, lierlin reports, the
Austro-ijerman and JJulganan troops
are advancing.
A new thrust seemingly has been
started by the Austro-Oermans along
the .Moldavian frontier, thus adding to
the difficulties of the Russians and
Rumanians, already hard pressed from
the south and east. Several lines of
new positions and 1400 prisoners were
taken by the invaders, in the first day
of their offensive into Moldavia from
the west, which may have for its pur
pose the cutting off of the ' retreat of
the R.us.io-Rumanian troops now oper
ating along the southern Moldavian
border.
Along the river Kasino and west of
Covesha, I'etrograd says, Rumanian
troops were driven back nearly a mile.
A desperate battle also is reported as
taking place near Sesmezo near Ocana,
and within the Moldavian boundary.
North of Rimnik-Sarat all attacks
were repulsed, according to I'etrograd.
Field Marshal von Mackensen has
reached Dumitresti, about twelve milts
northwest of Rimnik-t-arat and north
east of that town troops under his
command have captured several vil
lages. The number of prisoners taken
by this army totals 1400, in addition to
Cannon and machine guns.
The Rumanian province of Dobrudja
now is almost cleared of defenders, as
Berlin says Ratchelu, northeast of
Matchin bridge head, across the Dan
ube from Hraila, has been conquered.
Ratchelu is on the Danube.
West of the Meuse. in the Verdun
region, the forces of the German crown
prince have repulsed attacks by
French troops against the new German'
positions on Le Mort Homme, where
second and third line trenches -weie
entered by the Germans and 220 pris-
oners and seven machine guns taken.
Paris admits a slight success for the
; Germans, in this sector, saying thu:
: one trench south of Le Mort Homni 1
1 was entered by the attackers. Other
I efforts to advance between the Mfur.
I and Avocourt and in front of both L
I Mort Homme and Hill 3'i4 were it -j

He declares that nevertheless, it was
a triumph which proved beyond doubt,
the abibty of the allies to overthrow
Germany "when the time comes." The
British commander shows himself a
firm believer in the doctrine that the
entente allies can win the war, on the
western front.
"I desire to add a few words as to
future prospects," he says at the close
of the dispatch, which covers sixteen
closely printed pages. "The enemy's
power has not yet been broken nor is
it (jet possible to form an estimate of
the time the war may last before the
