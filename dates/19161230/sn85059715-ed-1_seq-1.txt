learned that a few days ago Presl- ;
dent Wilson sent a second note ex- i
planatory of the first to the Central '
powers and the Entente nations. This :
note has not been presented.
The reason for the withholding of
the second note is said to be that the
German reply received In the interim
showed that the German government
had not been Influenced by the "misconception
regarding the purpose and
aims of President Wilson's step,
which an unfriendly press in both
camps attributed thereto."
SECRETARY LANSING
REFUSES TO COMMENT
*A V ASSOCIATED PRESS)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 30?Secretary
Lansing refused to comment in any way
on the report that a second explanatory
note had been sent to correct
misrepresentation of the president's
note calling for peace terms. He indicated
that under the recent policy
of silence adopted by President Wilson
and himself in the peace negoti
ations he would make no statement
either affirming or denying such reports.
Other officials, however, said they
were sure no second note had been
sent and that the Berlin despatches
referred to the two statements by
Secretary Lansing issued the day after
the despatch of the original note.
AMBASSADOR SHARP IS
TO RECEIVE THE REPLY
(BY A3 IOC1 AT BO PRESS)
A PARIS, Dec. 30?The Allies' answer
to the German note of December
12 will be handed to Ambassador
Sharp Saturday, night,, says the Petit
Dai-lcton enrl nilRllahoR QltnRoi' T t
Is long and sets forth again the responsibility
of the Central powers for
the war. It insists on legitimate
reparation and restitutions demanded
by the Entente Allies as outlined
by Premier Lloyd-George and also
says that Germany, by failing to formulate
proposals for peace, removes
in advance any basis for pour parlers.
The note seeks to suggest that the
Berlin cabinet having proclaimed in
1914 its contempt for treaties cannot
pretend to obtain the same conditions
as powers respectful of signatures
and must offer guarantees.
