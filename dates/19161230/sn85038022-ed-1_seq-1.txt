Team From the High Hch.il Last.
Meht Score SI to 12.
In one of the most Interesltng con-
testa ever played on the floor of th"
High School auditorium the Alumni
team heat the regular team by a score
of 31 to 12. Thla la the first defeat
the Alumni were ever able to Inflict
upon the High School team, the fail
ure to do thla before being due to tho
fact that the forme.- have always been
racking In practice and team work
Thla was not so last night as the mom-
bera of the Alumni team have been
playing the game thla winter and so
were better prepared to beat the High
School.
The following was the line-up at
the opening of the game:
ALUMNI HIGH SCHOOL
Right Forward
Parker Everett
Left Forward
Hampton Thomas
Center
Marah Wood
Right Guard
Shea Downing
Left Guard
Dickson Brownlne
In the first half Walker was sub
stituted for Thomas. As the begin
ning of the second half the positions
of Walker and Browning were
changed and later In the game Walker
waa removed and Hicks put In his
place.
The first half started out very In
terestingly. The Alumni took the lead
when Hampton threw a geal on
Wood's foul. The High School then
scored three points. The Alumni
caught up with this and soon were far
enough In the lead to have easy go
ing. At the end of the first half the
score was 10 to 4 In the Alumni fn-
vor. The second half completed the
slaughter. Downing was the indi
vidual star of the High School team,
playing a brilliant game.
