the writer a lot of booze taken from

just west of the Experiment Station

looked like mighty poor stuff. The
sheriff shook one of the bottles and
we could see snakes, lizzards, scor
pions and other reptiles swimming
around in it. It was dead sure poi
sonous. And to think any sane man
would drink such stuff. Ugh! It
makes a man sick to even think of it.
The stuff will be turned over to the
incoming sheri a heritage from

GREETING.
It has been and is the ambition of the Free Press to serve the
people. We desire to print the "news," advance all legitimate enter
prises, and to advise the people in human effort. In the past we
were not able to do all we desired, but as the time pases we find our
ideas more and more being realized. The last year has been one of
the best in the history of this paper. We have been able to add very
materially to our plant, and now we promise the public a better pa
per and desire to enter more largely into their social needs.
Whileive have published each week the column of "Some Things
and Other Things" written by a paragrapher who is quoted by papers
all over this state, and we are glad to have them do it; thereis a col
umn of "Thinklets" that is appreciated by hundreds. Now we wish
to open a column to be known as the "Public Round Table" where
questions of general interest may be freely discussed.
There are many thoughts that are in "your mind, that make for
the public welfare that should be known and discussed. You who
have notions that should find their place in this column, send them to
us. e want your thoughts on subjects that will make for the pub
he welfare. We will not let grudges, insinuations and silly pre
judices be discussed, but those questions that make for a larger and
better Hays, will have a hearing. We will not publish anything that
you are not willing to write over your own signature. This is an age
that requires real manhood, so discuss real needs of the city. Do not
make the articles long. Write them so they can be read; talk to the
point; but think the subject through before you commence to write,
or we wil have to use the blue pencil. Get your copy to us by Tues
day. If we are. to be the city the future holds out for us, we must com
mence to plan largely, devise wisely, have a city pride and create, a
city spirit. We have outgrown the village idea. We are not to be
just a big overgrown country town, but fate has marked Hays to be
an educational and musical center, a railroad and wholesale center,
so lot us plan and build accordingly. We want you to work with us,
not so much to be a general booster but to become a real doer. Get
into the game. Give freely, plan largely, and work altogether for
Hays.
It seems to us we are now past that period when we ask the
question, "What is in it?" but we want to say "how much and what"
can we put into it to make our city the most beautiful and most de
sirable place in which to live in Kansas.
Now citizens, join with us to make the coming .years, and espe
cially the year 1917 the greatest and best year cf our history. We
are depending upon you to help us. Let us do no more shirking of
responsibility but pull together for Hays. Let us forget party pol
itics, church-anity, and social snobbery, but let us work together.
want to uphold righteousness, be merciful and forgiving, but ,
will not spare, the persistent and willful law breaker. We do not
want to be harsher than truth, nor to harm a human being; we want
the rich and poor, the learned and ignorant to be dealt with merci
fully, but the persistent, impudent, flagrant law breaker and social
disturber may expect to get all that is coming to him.
So here is to you! Wishing you a Happy, Prosperous New Year.
May we become better acquainted, understand each other better, and
catch the true spirit that is the making of a better, cleaner, nobler,
pursr civilization in which to live.

Had You Thought of It?
Did it ever occur to you, reader,
that Ellis county has been fooled a
number of times in years past, by pa
per railroad projects, none of which
have ever materialized. The exten
sion from Hollyrood, of the Santa
Fe, is about what we need. It would
place Hays and Ellis county in touch
with the outside world. The Anthony
& Northern which is now asking the
people of several townships in the
county to bond themselves and their
children for, years to come a road
iha s-.Vs-in' tht vd-ils. sc bnh
v.'fty and gets nowhere is hardly
what the people of this county want.
However, this is only a suggestion.
Take it or leave it as you please.
