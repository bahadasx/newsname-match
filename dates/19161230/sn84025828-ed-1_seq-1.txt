HITS POLICEMEN
Council Committee Would Reduce Appro
priations for Police, Fire and Health De
partmentsPolitical Jobs Untouched.
A reduction of $1,000,000 In tho ox
pondlturo of tho pollco department for
1917 was ordered by tho city council
llnnnco committee.
Such a reduction will necessitate
tho dlschargo of 700 policemen. Tho
only alternative, it is declared, is to
compol each member of tho depart
ment to tnko a six weeks' enforced
vacation.
In either enso tho retrenchment, ac
cording to pollco oillclals, will bo con
strued by tho criminal classes as a
direct invitation to flock to Chicago
for "easy pickings." Tlicso officials
say menaca to Hfo and proporty will
bo unparalleled In tho city's history.
They dcclaro Chicago ovon now has
insufficient pollco to copo adequately
with crime.
Tho action of tho committee; was to
return tho 1917 estimates of tho de
partment to tho chief of polico with
instructions to rcduco tho total
amount from $7,342,583, tho appropria
tion for tho current year, to $6,332,143.
Tho oxact amount of the reduction
called for Is $1,010,440.
The pollco department numbers
5,500 mombors, with an averago sal
ary of $1,300. Only a small part of
itfl. entire, appropriation goes for sup
plies, and accordingly tho bulk of tho
retrenchment would havo to bo mado
on salaries.
That tho flnnnco cotnmlttoo's pro
gram will bo adopted by tho city coun
cil is considered doubtful. Tho pollco
department reduction was ordorod In
tho course of applying a 13.70 por cent
horizontal cut to nil departments.

ARRESTS FOR SPEEDING
They Have Doubled in Number
Since the Cold Weather
Arrived.
Tho removal of motorcyclo police
men from tho boulevards becauso of
tho frigid tomporaturo, and tho Instal
lation of stop-watch men operating
"traps," has resulted In nn nvorngo of
thirty arrosts a day, according to sor
goant D. n. Doylo of tho West Park
pollco. Tho usual number is nrtoon
dally. Twolvo men, working In pairs,
aro statlonod on tho streets during tho
crowded hours.
"Spoedlng Is a hnblt," said F. X.
Mudd, when told of tho situation on
tho West Side. "Nino-tenths of It
could bo stoppod if pollcomon would
ask drivers why they woro hurrying.
Altogether too many aro nrrostod and
wo got along bettor without tho sys

running fast is usually thoughtloss

Sometimes tho motorcycles can't

A watch just a second off may causo

Peter .T. O'Brien, a mombcr of tho

asked about tho increaso of arrests,
said ho didn't know of tho situation
and would bring it to tho attention
of tho commissioners at tho noxt

in Chicago.

Probably tho first work to bo under

This will bo submitted to tho noxt
session of tho legislature, and It Is
hoped by mombors of tho commlttco
that it will bo possible to enact a
drastic bill, by which tho American
habit of treating will bo wiped out In
Illinois.
"A largo part of tho damago dono
by tho saloon Is caused by tho habit
of treating," Chairman Toinnn said.
"It Is not what tho nvorngo drinker
buys for himself, but what somobody
olso buys for him that is injurious."
"It also Is probablo that tho com
mlttoo will consider favorably Mayor
Thompson's provision for a $1,500 sa
ioon llcenso. Thoro Is n great deal of
sontlmont in fnvor of It among cor
tain elomonts in tho saloon business.
While it is rocognizod that many sa

that tho higher foo will result in get

Majority of State Senators Agree to Stand

Far Ahead of Hughes.
Twenty-four members of tho new
Illinois stnto senato havo signed up nn
agreement to act together In support

essential propositions.
In tho last session they wero known
as tho Barr-Dalley-Ettelson combina

Republican elements and that tho son

According to tho published official

WASCHICAG0 SLIGHTED ?
Many Think the Population
Underestimated.
Has Chicago been slighted by tho
United Stntes census enumerators?
A great many business men and pub
lic olllccrs bellovo that tho govern
ment census bureau is grossly under
estimating tho population of Chicago
by putting it at 2,407,722, when othor
census takers In tho city plnco tho
population ns high us 2,SOO,000.
Thoy pointed out that thrco cen
suses taken within tho last year nil
glvo n higher population than tho
government. Thoy woro of tho opin
ion thnt tho great Industrial prosper
ity enjoyed in Chicago slnco 1014 has
brought thousands of now residents
horo and established a much highor
rato of yearly Increaso than tho ofll
clol government census-takers allow
for.
Coincident with tho announcement
of tho government census rocords tho
cousus tnkon by tho Chicago postof
flco was mado public by Postmastor
Daniel Campbell. It places tho popu
lation nt approximately 2.S0O.O0O. This
calculation Is mado with Information
In reports of lottor cnrrlors as to tho
numbor of persons who received mail
during tho year. Postmaster Camp
boll believes Its nccuracy Is ncaror
correct than cousuhcs bnscd on other
methods of estimation.
Another census taken by tho Chi
cago Directory Company places the
population at 2,010,000, This flguro
Is reached by comparing tho rntlo of
tho last official population, which wns
2,185,282, to tho numbor of names In
tho 1910 directory.
A third consus in tho report of Wil
liam L. Badino, superintendent of
compulsory oducntlon, gives tho popu
lation of Chicago os 2,550,000. Tho
report says in part:
"Based upon tho minor population
conservative- multiplo which proved
tho only ono successfully closo to tho
actual fedoral enumeration of total
population In 1910, I cBtlmato tho
total population of all ages In Chica
go in 1010 to bo 2,550,000. Tho school
consus in 1914, when tho enumeration
covered nil nges, showed tho total pop
ulation to bo 2,437,520, which would
bo an Increaso in totnl population In
two years of 112,474."
Engineers of tho Chlcngo Tolophono
Company cstlmato tho population nt
2,000,000. Thoy dotormlno this from
tho numbor of telephones In uso nnd
tho Increaso of tolophono Installa
