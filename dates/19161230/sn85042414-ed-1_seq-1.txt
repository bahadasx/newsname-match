SENT TO HIE
UN,
I SAYS
Have Prepared no Petition
For Authority to Call
Walk-out.
Cleveland, O., Dec. 30.—
Warren S. Stone and W. G.
Lee, heads of the Railway
Engineers and Railway
Trainmen Brotherhoods, re
spectively, arrived in Cleve
land today following the re
jection of the demand by the
magnates' committee that
the Adamson law be put in
effect Jan. 1.
"It is highly improbable
,that there will be a strike
Monday," Stone said.
He declared untrue the re
port that a circular letter
had been sent to railway em
ployes, asking for a renewal
of the authority to call a
general strike.
"No circular has yet been
prepared," he said. Stone
said no further statement
would be forthcoming today
in Cleveland and there would,
be no meeting of the broth
erhoods' heads.
It was pointed out that a
general strike Monday was
an impossibility because of
the fact that railroad unions
would have to be notified of
such intention and they
would have to notify their
sub-chairmen. Lee said he
had nothing to add to the
statement given out yester
day in New York.

Washington, Dec. 30.—Counsellor
Polk of
tfte
state department and
Charles A. Douglas, local attorney for
tho Carranza government, conferred
today over the Mexican situation. Mr.
Douglas declined to comment and in
formation concerning the conference
was withheld by departinent officials.
It was understood, however, that a
suggestion was presented that the
voluntary withdrawal of American
troops from Mexico without awaiting
any agreement in this regard by the
Mexican-American commission, would
go far to clarifying the situation.
Mr. Douglas believes the only solu
tion of the problem to be found is In
the government withdrawing, upon its
own responsibility, the Pershing
forces and agreeing to a further dis
cussion of other Mexican difficulties
by the commission.
It was explained that General Car
ranza's failure to sign tho agreement
drawn at Atlantic City was due to the
condition imposed with reference to a
possible continuation of bandit activi
ty in northern Mexico.

HUB CHIEF POINTS
Of PttCf MESSA6E
EMWZED TODAY
Suggestion that Steps be
Taken to Guarantee Peace
is Overlooked.
REQUEST FOR TERMS
AROUSES EUROPEANS
Point that Neutrals May be
More Involved also is
Taken Lightly.
These points, taken in their order
of importance in the administration
viewpoint, are:
The fear that the position of neu
tral nations be "rendered altogether
intolerable" if the war continues.
The suggestion that arrangements
be made as a guarantee against simi
lar conflicts In the future.
The proposal that means bo found
for comparing the concrete peace
terms of both sides.
The last point has aroused most
comment and the first was emphasized
by Secretary Lansing's statement, aft
erwards modified, that the United
States itself might be drawing near
entrance into the war.
The administration, however,
thought the suggestion that an ar
rangement to preserve peace In the
future would attract more attention
among the entente allies than it ap
parently has and furnish a means
through which these nations could en
ter with perfect propriety into a ser
ions peace discussion.
jf such an arrangement could be
made, the administration feels, there
would be no ground for the fear that
agreements over terms made between
the belligerents would not be kept
after the war ends. It was pointed
out today that such a fear has been
one' of tfte tri&fn -objections of the
entente allies to entering Into peace
discussions.
Sweden Believes Jfoto.
The official copy of the Swedish
note also reached the department to
day, being similar in terms to those
from Norway and Denmark previous

Paris, Dec. 30.—The allies' answer
to the German note of December 12,

tomorrow.
It is long and sets forth again the
responsibility of the central empires
for tho ICuropean conflagration. It
insists on legitimate reparations and
restitutions demanded by the entente
as outlined by Premier Lloyd George
and also says that Germany, by fall
ing to formulate proposals for peace,
removes in advance any basis for
pourparlers.
The note seeks to suggest that the
Berlin cabinet having proclaimed In
1914 Its contempt for treaties, cannot
pretend to obtain the same conditions
as powers respectful of signatures
and must offer guarantees.

IN SHIPPING
Director of Hamburg-Amer
ican Line Says One Will
Not Follow War.
Bw?Hnr~De». J*.—(VK T-ondonV—
Albert Ballln, director general of the
Hamburg-American steamship line,
holds a view contrary to current opin
ion that the shipping trade will have
a great and long continued boom
after the end of the war. When the
world's commercial fleet resumes nor
mal activity, Herr Ballln says, much
more tonnage will be offered after
a few months than will be demanded.
The reason assigned for this view
is that ocean trade will suffer to a
high degree from a shortage of goods
for gxport. from high prices of raw
materials and food supplies and from
unfavorable rates of foreign ex
change.

privilege.
In some cases bidders found it nec

GERMANY'S IMMEDIATE
REPLY PRECLUDED THE
PRESENTATION OF NOTE
Says the First Note Was
Enough—Not Worrying
Over the Situation.
Berlin, Dec. 29, (via London), Dea.
30.—It has been learned that a few
days ago President Wilson sent a sec
ond note, explanatory to the first, to
the Central powers and the Entente
nations. This note has not been pre
sented.
The reason for the withholding of
the second note is said to be that the
German reply received in the interim
showed that the German government
had not been influenced by the "mis
conception regarding the purpose and
aims of president Wilson's step which
an .unfriendly press in both camps at
tributed thereto."
Other officials, however, said they
were sure no second note had been
sent and that the Berlin dispatches.
referred to the two statements by Sec
retary Lansing issued the day after
the dispatch of the original note was
announced.
Lansing is silent.
Washington, Dec. 30.—Secretary
Lansing refused today to comment in
any way on the report that a second
explanatory note had been sent to all
belligerents to correct misinterpreta
tions of the president's note calling for
peace terms- He indicated that under
the recent policy of silence adopted
by President Wilson and himself in
the peace negotiations he would make
no statement either affirming or deny
ing such reports, it is felt that much
misunderstanding might arise in the
popular mind, but it is held that the
various governments addressed will be
Influenced only by the official lnforma
tlm. which v.'ill be o.nite complete.
Xo Special Instructions.
Secretary Lansing has been most
emphatic ever since his two state
ments were issued in saying that the
president's note was absolutely self
explanatory and required no further
comment. He has stated also that no
special instructions were sent the
I American diplomats as to the manner
of presenting the note. Intimations
that the misunderstandings abroad.
particularly in the public mind, might
be dispelled by official statements
from here, have met with an unfavor
able reception. It has been said that
no matter what the public misunder
standings just at present, this situa
tion would eventually clear of itself
and must be suffered as part of the
results of keeping the negotiations ab
solutely confidential.
