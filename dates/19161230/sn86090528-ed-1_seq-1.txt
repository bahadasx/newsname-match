White Man Asks Negro for $2. as Price
of Getting Out and Not Appearing
Against Prisoners
J. W. McCarty, who was recintly
robbed and on whose statement two
white painters and one negro are now
in jail awaiting trial in the district
court on the charge of highway rob
bery, is now in trouble over the af
fair. From the evidence submitted to the
city court at his trial it appears that
McCarty was ready to leave town and
sought to profit by his connection with
the robbery case. He approached Jim
Hunt, a negro who runs a barbecued
meai. stand on Two street, and told
him that he was willing to leave town
for $5 and not appear against the-prisoners.
Hunt told him he had. no in
terest in the case. McCarty insisted
that Hunt should be interested in or
der to render aid to the negro prisoner.
Hunt still refused and then McCarty
is said to have agreed, to leave town
for two dollars. Hunt asked him to
return at 4 o'clock for his answer. The
negro then consulted the city officers
and upon their advice prepared a writ
ten receipt for the money, stating its
purpose, and this, McCarty, in order to
make two dollars, signed. lie was im
mediately placed under arrest and
charged with receiving a bribe and
with compounding a felony. Mayor
Coffman fined him $23 and in default
of the cash he went to the city jail.

UPTURE
President Wilson Warned that Severance
of Diplomatic Relations; With Cermany
Would Precipitate Hostilities
FAILURE OF PEACE
MOVE IS MENACE
If Consistent in Policy Toward Germany
This Country Will Find It Difficult
to Keep Out of War
By United Press.
Washington, Dec. 30 The idea of a
break yith Germany over submarine
warfare will, according to administra
tion views, constitute a club, forcing
Gremany to present a bettor working
basis for peace than she has yet given.
The thought of a coming - break, if
peace negotiations fail, is making Pres
ident Wiison doubly anxious to keep
up his work.
As outlined by a leading official, the
situation has simmered down to a
point where peace negotiations must
continue or this countdy, if consistent
in policy toward Germany, will be
forced to break with the Teutonic al
lies. No one wants war but the presi-
dent has been told that war would re
sult if this country should sever dip
lomatic relations with Germany.
The outlook for the immediate suc
cess of the president's peace Undertak
ing is admitted to be somewhat du
bious but absolute confidence is felt
that two or three months will see the
"breaking of the dawn,"

TEMPT
S'lerilf and Force, However, Could Find
No Evidence of Plan to Rob at
Ninnckah
Sheriff Hodge Bailey and two dep
uties were called to Ninnckah before
daylight this morning on what was re
ported to them to be an attempt to
rob the First. State bank of that town,
of which however, they found no
tangible evidence.
About 4 :!',() o'clock the sheriff re
ceived a call from that town saying
an attempt had been made to rob the
bank. The telephone wires had been
cut in all directions except via Law
ton, Anadarko and Waurika and It was
in this roundabout way tfcit Chickasha
was notified.
The sheriff and deputies Castlemtn
and Tidwell left immediately for Nin
nckah hut found no evidence of an at
tempt to loot tho institution. Two
men who ha,d been riding a freight
train had gotten off at Ninnekah short
ly after 4 o'clock this morning. They
reported to the local police that four
men had held them up and had forced
them to walk down the track to the
dailroad tool house which they were
forced to enter. The men, however,
forgot to lock the door. The four men
said they were going to rob the bank
and did not want these two men
around. They also stated that it was
getting so late that they might not be
able to rob the bank that night b'U
they knew where the money was and
could come and get it at any time.
The work of repairing the telephone
lines was taken up at onre and com
munication re-established with the out
side world.

Improving is tho statement of J. W.
Dickson, superintendent of construc
tion for tho Five United Agencies who
spent yesterday with General Agent
Eldon Lowe as a part of his vacation.
Mr. Dickson's headquarters are at
Muskogee and his visit here was no!,
official.
"Rather than promote, our duties lie
mainly in the improvement of construe.,
tion among tho Indians," said Mr. Disk
son. "Improvement in tho construc
tion and maintenance) of their houses
and barns and supervising their farm
ing machinery. The Indians are build
ing quite a number of good barns to
day, costing from $1200 to $ir.(H). While
not absolutely modern these contain
Htanchlons and other up to date ma
terial and accessories. Tho Indians
are now building houses which cost as
much as $5,000. Tho great difficulty
which we niicounted Is in inducing
them to build their houses and barns
In a manner that will promote sanita
tion. The Indians, for tho most part,
cannot understand why they should
have sanitary homes and they are be
ing taught the advantages and absolute 1
necessity for providing windows and
occasionally a sleeping porch,"

mats here today.
3y UnUed i'ress.
London, Dec. 30 Not only will th
allies answer the German peace pro
posals, clearly sotting forth the princi
ples for which the entente nations are
fighting, but their reply will also con
lain a general outline of the basis upon
which lOngland and her allies will be
willing to negotiate. This course of
action is confidently expected here.
The fact that the note will list the
terms to be demanded of Germany is
expected to be tho result of the awak
ening in Kngland within the last few
days to the realization-' that the Ger
man peace propaganda in neutral
countries must be answered.
The press and the public, are united
in the belief that the best answer Will
be a comprehensive reaffirmation of

of what the allies regard as necessary
from their enemies as the basis for
even consideratlng peace talk. Mean
