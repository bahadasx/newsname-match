The Year 1917
-0-
The New Year will soon be here
and the people in general are bet
ter prepared to start the New Year
in every line.
The year we are leaving has
been one in which our people have
realized beyond their expectations,
and this has given courage and
hope for better time in the future.
and this hope is clearly manifested
by the improvements we see every
where, new buildings, repairs of
those which had been neglected,
more land being prepared for large i
crops, and the people in other lines
feel more hopeful for the future,
we cannot but hope that things
will continue to improve and that
the country again become stable!i
and our people will look at things
coming with more certainty.
We hope that the coming year
will be one of happiness and pros
yerity for all.
The members of the Union Ben
evolent Society, a colored associa
tion, will have a supper for the
benefit of the society, at the True
Friend's hall on Saturday January

But Failed.
Sunday night burglars attemp
ted to open the safe of the Du
charmp Hardware Co., they first
tried to work the combination as
they left a piece of paper with a
record of the numbers that were
tried, several matches were burned
near the safe after the electric
lights in the store were put out by
the burglars, a brace and drill
were also left near the safe when
they were frightened away when
Mr. J. H. Duchamp and Mr. A.
Patin went to the store at ten
o'clock to get'some packages, Mr.
Duchamp thought he had heard
some one in the store and rushed
toward the noise, but Mr. Patin
believed the noise was from the
outside and no serious search was
made in the store, and the idea
did not occur to them to look at
the safe, as they would have been
convinced that the burglars were
in the store at the time. The
attempt at the safe was only dis
covered the next (lay. .There was
over $900 in the safe, the sales andt
collections of Saturday, had the
robbers succeeded in opening the
safe they would have made a goed
haul as all the ruoney was in Lill,.
