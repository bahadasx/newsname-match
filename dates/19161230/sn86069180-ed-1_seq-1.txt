VERY WISE
Archbishops In America Given
Greater Power by Holy
Father.
Itcccnt Decree Allowing: Fur
ther Autonomy in Selecting:
Subordinates.
Another Proof of His Belief in
the Power of the
Press.
CONDITIONS ARE ATTACHED
Ecclesiastical circles in Rome at
tach great importance to the decreo
issued recently by the Congregation
of the Consistory of the Holy See
.regarding the designation of candi
dates to sees in the United States.
By the decree American Archbish
ops gain a far greater extent of
autonomy than they havo hitherto
enjoyed tind Benedict XV. has
clearly cxpresed his wish that only
those American Bishops should bo
appointed who aro known by
American Archbishops to be entirely
sultablo for their exalted positions.
The long distance that separates
sonorica from Rome, the entirely
different conditions of the Catholics
In America from those in many
ohor lands, show this step to bo
a. vory wise one and one which will
too gladly welcomed by Catholics
throughout tho United States.
On nnd after Lent In 1917, at
intervals of two years, tho American
Archbishops will Indicate to their
Metropolitan tho priests whom they
think suitable candidates for vacant
Bishoprics, even should these not
belong to their dioceses. Tho two
essentials aro entire suitability of
the candidates and deep secrecy as
to tho reports on tholr suitability.
Before they are proposed to tho
.Metropolitan the higher prelates in
each diocese will, under a vow of
secrecy, be convened by their Bishop
to consider tho most suitable priests
for candidates to vacant sees.
Bishops aro asked not to think
themselves bound to support any one
candidate merely because he has
been proposed, but to act entirely
upon tho dictates of their own
consciences.
Tho Archbishops must make out
lists of candidates proposed by tho
filshops-nnd make thorough, though'
dooply secret, Inquiries about thoso
priests on the lists submitted. After
Easter the American Archbishops
will convene their Bishops, secretly
attd without ostentation, and wlth
oiit making any statements to news
Taper men either before, during or
.after the meetings as to results of
tho secret conference. At .this con
vention all present must take the
oath of secrecy. A secretary will
be elected from among tho Bishops
piesent and tho candidates will be
tully discussed.
The Pope makes tho condition
that these candidates bo of a ripe
age, good administrators, strictly
-orthodox, well educated, pious,
zealous, honest and very devoted to
the Holy See. Tho convention will
close by a secret ballot and tho
names of tho candidates who havo
obtained tho greatest number of
votes will bo reballoted till ono
winning candidato 1s obtained. His
.name will be forwarded to the Pope,
who reserves to himself the right of
rejection. The minutes of the meet
ing will bo sent to tho Apostolic
Delegate at Washington, who will
Jn turn send It to the Congregation
of the Consistory at Rome. The
.minutes, which remain with the
American Archbishop, shall be kept
in a secret archive and destroyed
after a year, or during that year
even, If there bo any danger of In
discretion. In addition, the Pope
exhorts each American Bishop to
make his own propositions to the
Holy Father, when an American
diocese becomes vacant.
The Rope has given another
proof of his belief in the power of
the -press. The Vatican, thanks to
his initiative, has bought over the
old Catholic Press Company, known
as the Societa Editrlce Romana,
and the many metropolitan and pro
vincial papers formerly owned by
them will now bo under direct Vati
can management. They include tho
-Corriero d'ltalla of Rome, the
Italia of Milan, tho Avvenlre of
Florence and many others. Hitherto
the only Roman paper which was
an Interpretation of Vatican
thought has been tho Osservatore
Romano, founded fifty-six years
.ago, me i'opo nas csuujuuwu
large sum of money to the enter
prise and henceforth the trust will
foe known as the Italian Editorial
Union. The watchword Is to bo
-"Patriotism and Catholicism." They
.say that His Holiness has great
hopes in his newest venture,

MOURN HIS DEATH.
By tho death of Dr. Peter S
Ganz, which occurred early Satur
day morning at his residence, '1442
South Sixth street, this city and
tho church Buffer a distinct loss.
Dr. Ganz's life was a shining ex
ample to all whose honor it was
to be of his wide acquaintance, and
to tho bereaved family is extended
tho sympathy of tho- entire com
munity. Born at Mount Carmel,
111., fifty-five years ago, ho came to
Louisville with his parents when
only four years old. Ho was edu
cated in the parochial school of St.
Marjs parish, and also attended
a private school. Ho began life
as a clerk In a drug store, studying
pharmacy in tho meantime at the
Louisville College of Pharmacy.
Reaching this stage of medical sci
ence, ho aspired to tho fullness of
tho profession, and twenty-three
years ago was graduated from the
University of Loutsvlllo Medical
School, a Doctor of Medicine. Later
ho was called to teach materia
medica and held other chairs In tho
school also. Dr. Ganz enjoyed a
wldo reputation as a family physi
cian, little aspiring to surgery. In
spito of a largo and lucratlvo prac
tice he found time to give his serv
ices without question to tho sick
and suffering poor all ovor the
city, and never drew tho line of
race, color or creed. His charity
work had made him ono of Louis
ville's best beloved physicians. Dr.
Ganz found time, too, for a deep
and leading interest in Catholic
social and charitable enterprises.
He was particularly devoted to the
work of tho "Federation of Catholic
Societies. For the past eight years
he had been a Vico President of
the American Federation of Cath
olic Societies and for tho past fouv
years President of tho Jefferson
County Federation. For six con
secutive years ho had represented
tho local societies at tho national
gatherings of the Federation. On
account of its work for the poor
Dr. Ganz was greatly devoted to
tho St. Vincent do Paul Society,
but tho charitable enterprise most
dear to him was tho St. Lawrence
Home for "Working Boys, of which
ho was a Director. He also was a
member of the Knights of Colum
bus, tho Catholic Knights and
Ladles qf America, tho Knights and
Ladies of Honor and tho Macca
bees. He was on tho staff of Sts.
Mary and Elizabeth Hospital. Dr.
Ganz is survived by his widow,
who was Miss Mary Wllhelmlna
Schmidt before her marriage to him
twenty years ago, and tho follow-
injr children:
Gilbert,,, RavjncjjjUejuaj
Eugeno and 'Miss Mary Wllhelmlna
Ganz; one sister, Miss Mary Rosa
Ganz, and ono brother, Joseph Ganz.
Tho funeral was held Tuesday morn
ing with requiem high mass at St.
Mary's church, which was thronged
with leading citizens of Louisville.
POPE MAKES PLEA.
Pope Benedict mado a plea for
pe'aco In his address at the Christ
mas reception to the Sacred Col
lege. Referring to tho messago of
Bethlehem tho Pope said that good
will among men was tho essential
condition toward obtaining "that
Just and durable peaco which must
put an end to tho horrors of the
present war." Tho Pope urged
those in power to hear tho voice of
the Sacred College appealing to
them to arrest tho destruction of
tho peoples, and to open their ears
to the admonition of tho Father of
tho Christian family seeking to
pavo tho way to justice and peace."
The Pope, according to report, in
speaking to Cardinal Gasparrl,
Papal Secretary of State, regarding
President Wilson's note to the
belligerents, said: "It 1b a docu
ment showing the honesty, justice
and far-sightedness' of the Ameri
can President."

Shows Wonderful Growth of the
Church in the United
States.
Only Six Living' of Those Who
Sat in Third Plenary
Council.
Father Wynne, S.J., Estimates
Catholic Population at
10,000,000.
NUMBER OF CHURCHES DOUBLED
Thlrty-tWo years have elapsed
since the third Plenary Council of
Baltimore. The Archbishops and
the Bishops of tho country, then
assembled in joint pastoral, com
mented on tho remarkable growth
of tho church during the eltrhteen
uouncu. Tiioy dwelt with special
emphasis on the growth of religion
and civilization in the Western
States. In relating tho full story
of tho church during tho oast
thirty-two years many books might
be written, for each diocese and
almost every parish has a story to
tell or sacrifice and struggle.
The roll of honor of tho Third
Plenary Council contained the
names of twelvo Archbishops and
seventy-one Bishops present, either
personally or by proxy. Only flvo
of those names are on the roll to
day: Cardinal Gibbons, who pre
sided as Apostolic Delegate; Arch
bishops Ireland and Keane, Bishops
Chatard and Gallagher, Bishop
Rlchter, dying only this week. To
these may bo added tho Abbots of
Conception nnd St. Benedict. Seventy-seven
Archbishops and Bishops
and four Abbots then present have
slnco been called to their reward.
In 1884 thero were twelve archle
plscopal sees, to which havo since
been added those of St. Paul and
Dubuque. Episcopal sees, together
with Vicariates Apostolic, numbered
fifty-nine In all seventy-one sees.
At that time America was repre
sented in tho College of Cardinals
by ono momber, Cardinal McClos
key. Today the American church
has three Cardinals; 111 dioceses,
or which fourteen aro archdioceses;
120 Archbishops and Bishops and
two Bishops of the Ruthenian
Greek rite. Tho Apostolic delegation
was established In 1893 with Car
dinal Satolll as first Apostolic Dele
gate. Four years later, in 1897,
he was succeeded by the present
Cardinal Martinelli, who on being
raised to the Cardinalate was suc
ceeded by Archbishop Falconto in
1902. The present Delegate, Arch
bishop Bonzano, the fourth In offlco,
was appointed in 1912.
In 1884 there wore 7,763
churches In the United , States. The
Catholic Directory for this year
gives the number of churches at
the beginning of 191C as 14,961.
It may be safely said that at the
present day the number of churches
Is double that of thirty-two years
ago. But tho growth in the num
ber of the clergy Is even more re
markable. Balancing the losses
through death in the ranks of the
clergy with the ordinations during
the current year, the total number
today is .well over 19,000,, secular
and. regular. In 1884 the iotal
number of both was 6,835.
Bishop McQuaid, in a eermon at
the Third Plenary Council of Balti
more, estimated the Catholic popu
lation of the United States at
6,500,000. The Catholic Directory
for this year gives the Catholic
population as 16,564,409, which ac
cording to many well versed In
catholic affaire Is much too low,
for the Catholic population ap
proaches very nearly twenty million
souls. Either estimate place our
strength at approximately one-fifth
of the entire population of the
country. If one extreme is too'
high, the other is too rlow; so ar
sumlng the middle term to e cor
rect, the Catholic population of the
United States would be about
18,000,000, or 1ml f the entire
Chrietten people of all denonatne
tlon of the country. It ie ,not a

p.
difficult matter to acqount for this
splendid growth, for tho samo
causes and principles, of increase
have been at work almost through
out the whole history bf the church
In America. '
In 1884 there werepln this coun
try 2,532 Catholic schools, in which
wore taught 481,834 children. To
day there aro 6,397 parochial
schools taking care of tho ele
mentary education 6f 1,456,206
children. Thirty years' ago there
were 708 seminaries, colleges and
academies for tho education of
tho youth of both sexes. Tho mill
ion and a half pupils under Cath
olic care and training do not'include
those who aro engaged In the study
of tho higher branches. Thero are
over 1,500 other educational insti
tutions consisting of- seminaries,
colleges, academies, universities and
technical schools. In pur academies
and colleges there are .over" 120,000
students; In tho professional and
university schools about 9(000; in
Catholic orphanages about 30,000;
in seminaries 6,200; f in all other
schools about 27,000; giving a
grand total of 1,648,400 young peo
ple In Catholic educational Institu
tions In the United States. Father
Wynne, S. J., who Isjauthorlly for
these figures, estimates the physical
valuo of those Institutions at

Her house was watched. Tho houses
of her brothers and sister, tho
houses of her friends were watched
by the secret police day and night.
She never got a letter, sho never
wrote a letter, that was not opened
nnd read by the English Govern
ment. And when the Government
got wind or her coming' to this
country, it asked the Amorican Im
migration officials at Ellis Island
to Keep her from landing.
She tells how Asqulth tried to
make her take hush-money "com
pensation money" ho called it. And
how she, was offered a passport to
this country ir she would promise
not to talk about tho war. She
tells her husband was arrested and
shot without pretense of any charge
against him. Speaking of some of
tho men and women In English pris
ons Mrs. Skeffington said:
"Tho Countess Marklewlcz Is
working in tho kitchen of tho
Allesbury Prison, John McNeill, who
was the head of the Irish Volun
teers, and who actually told all his
men to stay quiet, not even to
mobilize, is In Dartmoor Prison,
making sacks. And the two Plunk
etts are making mall bagB. Eng
land Is treating her political pris
oners as though they were con
victed felons, ordinary criminals.
She has broken all her own laws,
ana international law. Today In
Ireland thero is greater bitterness
of feeling than at tho time my hus
band was murdered. We are nil ex
pecting that there will be conscrip
tion. The Irish party In Parlia
ment may accept it peaceably, to
save Us face. Redmond will give
his own reasons for accepting con
scription. But tho English must
know that they will have to have a
large force of men In Ireland to
make conscription possible that It
will, not be1 a success.
. "And yet they will do it."
"Why?"
"Because It will give them the
chance, under 'the cloak of military
necessity, for a general massacre.
They want to wipe out the Irish
people. This is ono way to do It.
Another way is by famine. And
we are face to faco this winter with
the possibility of a famine Hke that
or 1847 a ramine In the midst of
plenty. The potato crop was
smaller than niBual. The English
buyers have come over and Inflated
tho prices, and taken every potato
they can get. And I myself have
seen shipload after shipload of
cattle the wealth of Ireland, and
Its food being taken out of tho
country to England.
."Conscription will unite Ireland.
For even Carson's followers aro
against it. It will bring the. crisis.
Now that Lloyd-George is in that
crisis is near. Perhaps it will
come In with the New Year. Lloyd
George is now recognized to be'
much the same sort of man as As
qulth. There is indeed not much
difference between them, except that
Lloyd-George is strong and Asqulth
Is weak. But they are both ad
venturers. Personal prestige and
ambition mean more to them than
the welfare of the "empire. K.ad
neither of them. has eared what b
t
nie
eame of Irekuul.
"The gift of eyen Colonial hom'
.rule will mean very little to Ire
land now. Ireland ought to be
mentioned at tho peace conference
and her Independence guaranteed
when the fate of other small na
tions is being discussed. This was
my husband's great desire. It may
bo that It was for that ho had to
give his life."
INTO ETERNAL REST.
After a membership of flfty-twp

greatly beloved for her works of
cnarlty and sunny disposition, re
taining tho latter almost to tho
hour of her death, was called to
her heavenly reward on Friday of
last week, at tho ripe ago of seventy-four
years. Sister Celestlno

LLOYD-GEORGE AND IRELAND.
The report that secret negotia
tions looking to a settlement of the
Irish question arc being carried on
does not promise much for Ireland.
There is no doubt that tho Irish
situation is tho sorest spot in Great
Britain's politics at present. Her
ruthless treatment of all sympa
thizers with tho Dublin uprising,
tho execution of Casement and the
leaders in that revolt and the eight
months' enforcement of martial law
throughout the country have driven
Irishmen into a mood of sullen de
fiance. No support can bo ex
pected from Ireland unless some
thing is done to atone for the
blundering severity with, which Eng
lish officialdom met the uprising of
Easter week.
- The new Premier, Lloyd-Goorge,
has long been known as an ardent
friend of homo rule. Asqulth never
Intonded to fulfill his promises to
Redmond if ho could find some way
to escape. Ho needed tho support
of the Irish Nationalists In Parlia
ment, but only Insofar as they
carry out ins pledges to tnem
When the real test camo he shame
lessly betrayed them. Now Asqulth
himself has been sacrificed by tho
friends for whom ho broke his
promises to Ireland. Lloyd-George
also needs tho support of tho Na
tionalists. At present they stand
In opposition to the Cabinet. To
win their support Is the purposo of
tho secret negotiations. Wo havo
little faith, in the result of such
negotiations. While we believe
that Lloyd-George is more de
pendable than Asqulth, ho Is sur
rounded by men who are tho bit
terest enemies of home rule. He
would probably grant all that Irish
men ask if his hands wero free.
Ho realizes the injustice that has
been done Ireland nnd he would
undo It if ho wero able. But he
alone can do little." Tho compro
mise measure that will come forth
from these negotiations will
probably be no moro satisfactory
than the separation bill proposed
and then withdrawn by Asqulth.
Ireland's causo still waits.

CANDIDATES FOR MAGISTRATE
With his new hobby of prohibi
tion old William Jennings Bryan
was hero Thursday evening and
lectured on the evils of liquor, but
hl3 coming or, presenco did not
awaken the old enthusiasm we used
to see when tho silver-tongued or
ator came through hero with his
slxteen-to-one and antl-lmperlallsm
speeches. Then he was met by
throng after throng at tho depot
and hotel, who hung on his every
word and cheered him madly. It
Is again tho samo old story. As
Lincoln said: "You can fool all tho
people somo of tho time, some of
the people all of the time, but you
can't fool all of the people all of the
time." This Is Bryan's case in a
nutshell. Ho fooled a great many
of the people for awhile, and tho
class that ho fooled tho most and
probably for tho longest tlrao are
now his bitterest critics. Talk to
any of tho Democrats who are roast
ing Bryan nowadays and In nineteen
cases out of twenty the majority
will tell you that they wero sucker
enough to follow tho Boy Orator
years ago and even vote for him
for tho Presidency. Bryan Is smart
enough to see that his standing in
the Democratic party Is just what
Roosevelt's Is In the Republican
party, and ho has hit on prohibi
tion as a new tack to attract" foN
lowers, and with a national followi
Ing ho can command big lecture
prices and Incidentally run for
President on tho Prohibition ticket
In 1920.
Bryan lectured here under the
auspices of tho Democratic Forward
League, a Kentucky organization,
which seems to be fostered by tho
Ualy-Be'ckham' cHquerthe- speakers
and others being Identified with
this element In Kentucky politics.
Beckham being United States Sen
ator in name only at Washington,
plans to get In on the ground
door In the event that Bryan se
cures control of tho Democratic
party with prohibition. As ho and
Haly realize that at present they
are with no power In either State
or national politics, they have
nothing to lose in taking that
chance. Thoso comprising the For
ward League aro practically un
known In the Democratic party, and
the few who are known have only
been shoved forward at some tlmo
or another by Haly as figureheads In
a campaign. The Democrats "who
havo been bearing the brunt of tho
battle for years think the name of
"Forward" very appropriate for
theso new-comers, that Is if you
construo the word "forward" to
mean tho same as you would apply
to a fresh youngster for Instance
Another appropriate term for these
self-appointed custodians or tho
Democratic party's future would be
the "Nervy Nats" or "It pays to ad
vertise." Col. P. H. Callahan and
Henry Johnson, who are tho Louis
ville representatives In tho fight for
prohibition, were supporters of the
Progressive ticked headed by Wood
Axton Just three years ago.
Former Tax Receiver Charley
Mllllkcn is the latest to be men
tioned as a probable candidate for
County Clerk, and as he has a big
following In both city and county
will be a hard man to beat. Mr.
Mllllken showed himself n sure
enough campaigner In 1915, when
slnglo-handed ho canvassed the
State for the Democratic nomination
for Secrotary of State and was only
beaten a. little ovor 1,000 votes by
Barksdale Hamlett, who in turn
was defeated by the Republican. A
little more support or Mllllken then
would have given us, the office now
held by a Republican. Sheriff
Charley Cronan still continues to
be the only Democratic candidate
for the Mayoralty nomination, and
tho only element that would Jeop
ardize his succession to Mayor
Buschemeyer would be the selec
tion or a ticket not favorably suited
to. every element in the Democratic
party. Mr. Cronan to head the ticket
has already met with tho approba
tion of all classes, but he should
not bo compelled to carry a lot of
unknowns or nominees gathered
from ono section or, tho party.
