We announced last week the
parchase of a lot of ground on
iSouth Market street by the Clar
ion Company and the erection of
R modern bric.k building on same.
.The announcement of the pur
ehase and the intention of the
o.Empany to build a substantial

'hat the public has already
u: ,own, that this newspaper, a
: iture in St. Landry for more
tan, .twenty-six years, is a per
;pene-t institution.
Plans specifications for the
w building are being drawh by
chitect T. George Chachere for
e contemplated building and we
assure the readers of The
a~rion that the building will not
'.l, y be an ornament to the city
~t will amply serve the needs of
-tihe paper for a long time to come
-. Within a brief time bids will be
Idvertised for-the erection of this
iilding and it is expected` that
he new structure will be ready
aror occupancy early in 1917.
.:. As soon as the business of this
/newspaper warrants it--and
prospects are that will be soon
we propose to install better, more
modern and faster press facilities
and, perhaps, another linotype-
all in order to keep pace with the
growing demands of this city and
parish for a larger and better
./newspaper, and it is just possible
-., that within a brief time "The
Daily Clarion" and other publi

OR. LAZARO HAS NEW
VARIETY Of EOTTON
DISTRIBUTE 900 QUARTS OF
SEED IN DISTRICT
Allotted This Amount by Govern
ment and Constituents Will
Get the Benefit
.The time is fast approaching
when the farmers throughout
this section will begin to think of
next year's planting operations
and as it is a known fact that cot
ton seed for planting is short,
every famer will be on the look
out for a supply. Many new var
ieties have been tried out in this
section since the appearance of
the boll weevil. Some have
proved valuable while many have
not been worth the time taken to
%plant them. However, every
farmer is naturally inquistive
and ready to try "something
new." He is ready to experi
ment and the government is al
ways ready to assist him and is
forever on the watch to secure
something good for him.
The Clarion acknowledges the
xreceipt of a letter from Dr. L.
Lazaro, the congressman from
this district, under date of Dec
ember 20, wherein he states that
h. has been. allotted nine hundred
quarts of seed of a new variety
-of cotton which he will distribute,
to his constituents as'long as the
supply lasts and not. later than
February 15. Quoting from his
letter, "the plan of the depart
ment is to furnish a quart pack
age which will enable the farmer
to make a trial of theseed and if
it is satisfactory, upon Applica
tion they will then furnish him
with a half-bushel of seed for a
practical start with the new
strain for hisiiext season's crop.
Each package of the seed will be
accompanied by a. circular letter
giving full information regarding
the variety and the department's
plan for assisting the farmer in
establishing ti on his farmn."
As the supply is small, those
progressive farmers in this parish
who wish to give the variety a
trial -would do well -to:write to
the doctor at once.

Christmas 1916 has passed intc

with- water and not with "booze.'
Rain feel in torrents and kepi
most people indoors the entir(
day. Lowering skies and floods
from above drenched streets and
roads and made travel difficult
and disagreeable.
Few drunks were in evidence,
though a small number "cele

style. Merchants did a thriving
business Saturday but the saloon
men state that their Christmas
trade was smaller than usual.
There were few drunks and no
disorders of note and as a nat
iral consequence the city court
.ad a slim docket following the

While the deluge of rain inter

by the farmers of the cou y.
