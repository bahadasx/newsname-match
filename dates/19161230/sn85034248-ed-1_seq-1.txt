"The Wager."
This feature, in which Emily Stev
ens will be seen at the Grand Theatre
tomorrow, is one of those clever and
exciting stories that make the time
seem short because they keep up the
suspense and provide a very satis
factory climax. Written especially
for Miss Stevens, "The Wager" gives
this great actress unusual opportuni
ties to show her fine emotional pow
ers. It deals with , bet made by busi
ness men and a police official that
one of them, a jeweler, can be vic
timized of jewels worth $5000.
"Diamond Daisy" Doyle (Miss Stev
ens) is called in by the police of
ficial to help him win the money.
Then follow a series of dramatic
situations that are unique in mo
tion pictures. The self-sacrificing
spirit of Daisy Doyle, her great love
for a man who is hounded by the
police, the efforts of an energetic de
tective to put Daisy in prison despite
her reformation, are some of the ab
sorbing features of the picture.
The direction is excellent through
out and the acting equally so. Miss
Stevens is easily the star, but it must
be added that her supporting cast is 1
flawless. The types are all well
chosen.
There is nothing that appeals more
forcibly to the average audience than
"adventure," and adventure is the
keynote of the play.
"Seventeen."
One of the most enjoyable film i
comedies of the season is the Famous
Players' excellent adaptation of
Booth Tarkington's celebrated novel,
"Seventeen," which comes to the
'`Grand Monday. The -story is brim
ming over with wholesome and delici- r
ous humor. William Sylvanus Bax
ter, for such is the name the novelist
has applied to his youthful hero, has 1
reached the age where he scowls on
all woman-kind, from his meddle
some little sister on. This condition I
of affairs continue, until the arrival
on the scene of a trifling young miss
who steals his heart away and causes
him to be attacked by day dreams in d
which he himself poses as the redoubt
able hero. The most amusing inci
dents which take place before his dis
illusionment are the wearing of his
father's dress suit on the wrong oc
casion, his decision that he has ar
rived at the shaving period, and his
negotiation for a thousand-dollar au
tomobile in which to elope with the
pretty new-comer. Anu no less auus
ing is his suicidal attitude when on his
trial trip with the machine he
smashes a wheel, and for his pains
faces a fifty-dollar damage fee or jail.
The delicious humor of the scenes in
which William solemnly prepares for
death cannot be overestimated.
Jack Pickford's impersonation of
the young hopeful of seventeen is in
imitable. Louise Huff in the lead
ing feminine role is also pleasing;
prettily dressed and dainty. The
supporting cast is excellent.
"Her Double Life."
How a girl rises from life in the
slums of London to one of the high
met places in English society, then
tuddenly faces the relinquishment of
her exalted rank when the deception
by which she had climbed is exposed,
is vividly told in "Her Double Life,"
featuring Theda Bara, which the
Grand will present Tuesday.
Miss Barn takes the part of Mary
Doone, a tenement child who, through
force of circumstances, makes her
home in the "Re'fuge," a parish house
at which Elliott Clifford is pastor.
When the call comes for war nurses,
*ary answers.
At the front she meets Lloyd Stan
ley (Stuart Holmes), a war corres
bModent, whom she had known in Lon
4On. She is saved from dishonor at
Stanley's hands. by the bombardment
of the hospital tent. After the at
isek, Mary finds the body of a young
t l in the tent. It is that of Ethel
Wardley, a niece of Lady Clifford's,
who is on her way to make her home
'ith the aunt she has never seen.
Mary changes clothes with Ethel,
,khes the girl's papers and luggage,
aid goes to Lady Clifford's. She is
eceived as the niece. The aunt loves
Sgirl, and Elliott, the son, soon falls
i love with her also.
Then Stanley returns to England.
e brings with him Ethel Wardley,

_,taived on the battle line. They go
elther to the Cliffords, and are
it to disclose the truth about
Y, when the poor girl confesses.
She sees then that further life with
'. Cliffords is impossible, although

*wants her to stay. But Mary re

"Under Cover."
~nder Cover," the Grand's fea
attraction for Wednesday, con
a big measure of suspense, a
that runs from the beginning
e end. Its action is fast and yet
; it hooks up without a jolt at
Place. No one but a Killjoy would
attempt to outline the story to any
one with a remote chance of seeing
it for himself. The kick is in the fin
ish-and it comes very much within
the domain of the surprise.
iThe director has embellished the
story by giving it a pictorial setting,
a setting befitting the financial and
social positions of the chief charac
ters. There are scenes on ship and on
shore-and the staging is always con
vincing. Then, too, there i<, a fine
cast, the members of which well may
have found unusual satisfaction in
their roles. But the dominating notes
are speed, smoothness and tension.
Owen Moore is Stephen Denby,
and very completely does he deceive
the observer. Mr. Moore has a big
part and he "goes to it." Hazel
Dawn is Ethel Cartwright, the young
woman who under duress becomes an
agent of the United States govern
ment. She does not overlook the
dramatic opportunities; of them she
makes much. Several other well
known players contribute their share
to the making of an exceptional
picture.
"The Man She Married."
Dramatically effective is the five
reel production, "The Man She Mar
ried," which the Grand announces as
its Thursday offering. Starting with
the marriage of the heroine to a
sharper who is after her money and
who robs and deserts her, the events
are carried along to the big situation
where the woman, now the wife of a
worthy man, goes to the rooms of her
former husband in order to save her
step-daughter from becoming another
of his victims. Although far from
novel, having received in the last
forty years the endorsement of a
number of prominent French drama
tists, the situation has lost none of its
ability to score. The preceding
threads of the plot are woven into
the author's design with skill, and the
result is a story that is theatric, but
maintains a firm hold on the interest
of the spectator from first to last
reel.
Gail Kane, Montagu Love, Arthur
Ashley and Muriel Ostriche play the
leading parts and give thoroughly
satisfactory impersonations of their
respective roles.
"The Pricesof Fame."
The Friday offering at the Grand
will be "The Price of Fa~ne," a five
part drama featuring' Maric MacDer
mott in a dual role. *The story is of
twin brothers-William; successful
but inclined to be unscrupulous;
John, n6t successful, but possessing a
full share'of intekrity. In ability the
two seem to be well matched. Wil
liam is in love with Constance Pros
ton, who does not appear particularly
enthusiastic when in his company.
When William is taken ill in the mid
dle of his campaign for the senate, it
is deemed politically expedient to in
duce John to take the stump in his
place. Likewise John, who for some
years hitherto had been estranged
from William, is, in order to conceal
the incapacity of William, asked to
call upon Constance. He does so
against his wishes. The manner of
indifference changes. Constance be
comes the lover. On the death of
William she reveals the fact that she n
has never been deceived for a mo
mentt.
ment.
Mr. MacDermott plays the two
roles with his usual notable skill and
judgment. Naomi Childers, as Con
stance, finely draws the role of the
woman who as between two men of 1
similar outward characteristics finds
in one nothing much, and in the other
the strongest possible attraction.
Mary Maurice is "Mother" Mau
rice-one of the sweetest, most lov
able players on the screen. L. Rogers
Lytton is the "boss," the politician
capitalist who controls men and j
things. It is a strong quartet, and
they make the most of a story that is I
entertaining, and at times dramatic.
As to the latter, this is especially true
of the denouement, where Constance t
declares to John that from the first
she was aware of his identity.
"The Heart of a Hero."
Every American honors Nathan- I
Hale, the man who said: "I regret
that I have but one life to give for
my country." "The Heart of a Hero"
is a visualization of the romantic side
of Nathan Hale, the immortal hero of
the American Revolution. The set
tings in this picture, exterior and in
terior, are most authentic of the
times when America was in its mak
ing. It rings with patriotism, thrills c
with excitement, cherishes with fond
memories, and touches the heart with
its wonderful love. It is a story the f
whole world will enjoy seeing, for the
reason that it portrays the strength
of a strong man and a loving woman, t
and, as one of the critics said, "Is ac
story that will be discussed by every
body for its greatness and its beau- f
ty."
This stirring photodrama, in six t
parts, with Robert Warwick and Gail h
Kane featured in the leading roles. c
will be the New Year's eve offering at
the Gem Theatre (Sunday, Dec. 31).

"CUPID AND CONTRABAND."
Times - Ficayune Photodrama to Be
Shown at Gem Theatre.
,-C.::,ij I..,d Contraband," a superb
si:d-p:! phoiodrama produced in New
",riens under the auspices of the
Times-Picayune, with fifteen talent
ed young women of New Orleans and
siurrounding territory playing the
principal parts, will !;e the New Year
:,iering at the Gem Theatre. The'nic
Lure tells the following thrilling story:
Loui'iana Holmne-, the petted
d':lghter of a me!'rchant of an old
ou hcern type, is ambitious and seeks
a career in a newspaper office. Tom
Lane, a .~cret service agent, loves
Lou. Lou's father is not averse to
securing a .;hare oI the rich payments
made by Central American revolu
tionists for eoni:,raband supplies, but
he keeps his dealings in this channel
secret. A rich vein of comedy is de
veloped when Lou and her friends
malke up a hiouse party at Lou's home.
The beautiful grounds are permeated
with love and the young men who
have been invited to the party come
perilously near to making life-long
contracts. A lov-elorn maiden, like a
sprite, breaks up the matches, but not
until Lou has allowed her pleasures
to interfere with her work, and she is
disnmisscd from the newspaper upon
which she had an assignment.
AMeanwhile her father has secretly
contracted for the delivery of war
suplplie to Signor Dravado, represent
ing a revolutionary party, and also
e hass forbiddien Tom Lane to marry
Lou until Tom has at least $10,000,
which is '9i0 more than Tom pos
sesses. Tom comes in the course of
what appears to be a bribe of $10,000,
but he spurls the temptation. The
circumstances thicken about him un
til it is made to appear that he has
proven faels to Lou and been enmesh
ed in the schemes of Yvette, a South
American ivmpire. Lou pleads for
reinstatem'ent at the newspaper and
i; given the most difficult assignment
on the paper in the hope that she
might fail and stop bothering the city
editor. Her efforts result in her fall
ng into the hands of La Belle Creole,
the confidante of Dravado, where she
is locked in a sectret room. She is res
ued by little Mignon, and the girls
oin in a chase in a swift motorboat
a rescue Tom, who has been over
powered and taken aboard the revolu
tionary vesse+ which is waiting to sail
&ith goods furnished by Lou's father.
flhe pursuit of the girls precipitates
en unexpected fight on the plotter's
,essel. Tom is rescued. Lou finish
s: a remarkably clever story which
:eve:ils that her father has been mix
ti up in the contraband trade, which
act is used by Lou and Tom to make
irm forget his objections to their
at:rriage and to induce the obdurate
terchant to promise a partnership to
is prospective son-in-law, and to quit
ealing in contraband.

Their Praise.
Another link with our neighboring
town of Belle Rose is provided in the
following grateful and generous state
ment of a well-known resident there,
,Mr. Lauve, who says:
E. E. Lauve, postmaster, Belle
Rose, La., says: "LaGrippe weaken
ed my kidneys and I had difficulty in
retaining the kidney secretions. They
contained much sediment and were
unnatural. My back was so stiff that
I took to bed. My eyes were swollen I
most of the time. Doctors could do 1
nothing and neither did the remedies
I tried help me. I then began taking
Doan's Kidney Pills and although I
had run down in weight to one hun
dred and thirty-one pounds, I im
proved so steadily that in a short time
I weighed one hundred and sixty-five
pounds. I have remained at that
weight ever since. My kidneys are
now normal and I don't have any
trouble from my back."

Secretary of State on Trail of De
linquent Automobile Owners.
Secretary of State James J. Bailey
has mailed out circular letters to par
ish and city officials all over the state
soliciting their co-operation in the
collection of state licenses from auto
mobile owners.
As this money is used exclusively
for the building of good roads in
Louisiana, Secretary Bailey thinks all
should be interested in the success of
the department in collecting the
ceise.
"My experience in this department
for the past six months convinces
me," says Mr. Bailey, "that in order
to properly enforce this law, I must
have the co-operation of parochial and
city officials, auto dealers and good
citizens generally."
A penalty for failure to register
motor vehicles was fixed by an act
of the 1914 legislature, and the sec
retary of state urges that all delin
quents be reported to his department
::: well as to the district attorneys.
'he Calcasieu Progress is the naerr
of a neat and promising six-column I
folio newspaper established at Sul
phur, Calcasieu parish, La., by Wil- I
liam Hearne, whose Vinton Booster
was burned out some weeks ago. it
is assumed that the little town of Sul
phur offered inducements better than
those held out by Vinton for the sup
port of a paper, else the change of lo- 1
cation would not have been decided b
upon by the publisher. In any event f
it is to be hoped that the name of c
the new Progress will be amply ex
emplified in its future advancement
and prosperity.

A Junk Fund.
In order to get money for Red
Cro..e work, the Canaidian women
hb:ve star'ed a collection of old paper,
bottles, rig;;, rii,lbe and all the ma
terials that are so well summed up by
the word junk, Of course, all the
c-ildrer wer en:li:;ted in the work.
Every house, eve1y long unmolested
attic, t-acait !lots -and n thousand and
one othor nia;ces yielded up their
iquoi of junk.
A place became necessary to store
it in. The city of Toronto's harbor
comnmission offered a warehouse, and
he:e today a dozen women are almost
co:nstantly engaged in sorting and
p-eking the collected matter. In the
ir::t month. from this new and as yet
not fully learned business, the wo
men e!eared $1619, and figures to
date. show that they have started a
S-in.ess that now looks likely to re
turin i25,000 a year without the in
v':rtmtnt of a cent of capital, and
whieh required only organization and
hard wor'k.
such "'omen are deserving of the
vote and it is easily understood why
the provinces of Saskatchewan, Al
'ie ta, Manitoba and British Colum
bi . enfranchised their women.
Churches Catching Up.
There are questions arising today
_h:tt require for their solution the
help of all .moral forces. Churches
are finding this out.
'he Fedleral Council of Churches
of C(hrist in America held its con
vet-ion i: St. Louis in December.
ft. resolved significantly that "Women
shoild have equal wages for equal
v-o:"." and expressed itself that "The
church has been backward in the wo
m" oi's cause."
"in the present relation of the sex
es, due in part to the culmination of
the movement for the freedom of
v/wom:en, coincident with the econom
ic chan:ges of the war, we urge that
the churches lend their aid to the wo
men; that they use their utmost en
ide-vors to protect the home and to
so .reuaril those women, particularly
those girls who go out from it into
industry; that they stand for the prin
ciple of equality of recompense where
there is equal service, and for full
freedom of entrance int the world's
work; that they reinf the spirit
of chivalry toward w n under
these changed condition,-."
Need Real Mothers.
There is a home for orphan chil- I
dren at Atchison, Kansas, that has
heretofore been managed by a board i
of men trustees. The Good Govern
ment League has decided that these i
institutional children need mothers,
and has petitioned Governor Capper I
to appoint a new board of women.
The League believes that women have
more influence with children. Sounds
reasonable. Kansas has set the pace N
for many good things in state gov
ernments, as the official reports testi
fy. Of course, it must be remember- t
o.d that Kansas women have the bal- i
lot and can co-operate with men vo
ters in bringing about the best condi- I
tions for the homes of the state. r
A Premier's Reverence.
The premier of Canada spoke at a
meeting in New York, and in telling
of the splendid way in which Canada
women have voted and worked, he
said: "I reverence the women of the
United States for what they have
done, hut I shall bow to the woman
hood of the world for what the wo
men of Canada have done in this
war." No wonder four provinces of
Canada have given such able women
the vote.

The visit of the three torpedo boat
destroyers, Sterett, Monaghan and
Lamson, to this city and other river
towns is being looked forward to with
more than the usual amount of inter
est, and a cordial welcome will be ex
tended the gallant little war craft
here and elsewhere.
The destroyers are being sent up
the river by the Navy Department in
the interest of recruiting, and will
have aboard some ten or more com
missioned officers and about one hun
dred and eighty petty officers and
"man-o'warsmen." It is very prob
able that Lieutenant Commander L.
B. Porterfield, who is in charge of the
southern recruiting district of the
Navy Department, will accompany the
ships. The commissioned officers
aboard the vessels are as follows:
Sterett-Lieutenant (jg) G. W.
Gates, and Assistant Paymaster M.
C. Merriman.
Monaghan-Lieutenant (jg) J. F.
Cox, Lieutenant F. M. LeRoche.
Lamson-Lieutenant (jg) F. J.
Comerford, Ensign C. A. Macgowan
and Assistant Surgeon O. C. Foote.
The itinerary of the ships will be
as follows:
Jan. 2-Leave New Orleans, arrive
Donaldsonville. Distance, 80 miles.
Jan. L6.--Leave,Dotwupud iltlee a.r s

Jan. 24-Leave Natchez, arrive
Vicksburg. Distance, 100 miles.
Jan. 30-Leave Vicksburg for New
Orleans.
The ships, during their stay here,
will be open for visitors in the after
noons. The Navy Department ex
presses the hope that many citizens,
particularly young men who are elig
ible for enlistment in the navy, will
visit the ships and get first-hand in
formation as to the advantages the
navy offers to young men of the right
sort.

BED-TIME STORIES
By Master Bernard Lemann
i- ';=
Fussy-Cat Tlwn.
Many years ago, on an island it
the Atlantic ocean, there was a vil
lage by the name of Fussy-Cat Town
It was called this because all its in
habitants were cross (except one wo.
man who was very kind). Because
the woman was good the villagers
were jealous of her.
At a distance was ,the "haunted
forest," where-the fairies lived. The
people were afraid to go near it.
At the house of the kind woman,
there was born a girl. This made the
people hate the kind woman more, but
she did not pay any attention to their
fussing. She named her baby Happi
ness, because she had brought her
great joy.
As Happiness grew older she be
came more like her mother. She
would never fuss.
Instead of playing with the fussy
children of the village, she would
chase butterflys or lie oi her back and
look up at the blue sky. Sometimes
her mother would tell her stories
about the fairies who lived in the
"haunted forest."
One day as Happiness was going to
fetch water from the well, she saw an
old,-gray-haired woman walking along
in the hot sun. The villagers were
hooting at her and stoning her. "You
ought to be ashamed of yourselves,"
said Happiness. "Come home with
me, poor old woman."
Happiness brought the old woman
to her mother. She and her mother
gave her food and drink and gave her
their own bed to sleep in.
The next morning Happiness
awoke and found the old woman
gone, and in her place a beautiful
fairy stood.
"This," said the fairy, "is because
you have been kind to ethers." Then
she disappeared.
The sun began to rise. It was the
beginning of a beautiful Christmas
morning. Happiness ran quickly and
awoke her mother. Such a surprise!
There was a pot of porridge on the
stove, whose rust had disappeared;
there was a stable full of hay, and a
co* grazing in the pasture; there
were story books on the shelf. Hap
piness and her mother ere now mer
ry. All through the ouse sweet
vioces echoed, "Merry Qhristmas."
How the villagers wis hd they had
been good! I can ass i you they
were better throughout.t next year.
All the fairies dancedIi the forest.
The whole frest ec ` wt merry
The whole day Happi
mother heard sweet voices calling,
"Peace on earth, good will toward
men !"

denweyer of Prairieville, M. G. and
Jesse Sevario, of Acy, all residents of
Ascension parish; and Adam Baker,
Gus. Deutsch and George Larson, of
Livingston parish, recently made an
inspection trip of the Amite river
and its tributaries, for the purpose of
investigating conditions relative to
the drainage of lands on the east and
west sides of Amite river in the par
ishes of Iberville, Ascension and Liv
ingston, and parts of East Baton
Rouge and St. James. These lands
comprise about one hundred thousand
acres, and are now subject to over
flow every year. The territory is
particularly adapted to cattle raising,
and with proper drainage magnificent
crops could be grown. Gov. Sanders
was impressed with the possibilities as
revealed by the trip, and assured the
members of the, party that he would
do all in his power to assist in the
drainage project.

SOUTH IN THE SPOTLIGHIo
Enormous Economic Development
Predicted For This Region.
With cotton, rice and sugar in a
commanding position, the entire
south and particularly the Gulf coast
states are taking definite steps to in
sure a long continued era of pros
perity. Three great movements to
exploit the south are well under way.
The Gulf coast country of Alabama,
Florida and Mississippi has organ
ized the Gulf Coast Development Lea
gue, which, backed by bankers, cut
over land owners and winter resort
proprietors, will spend $250,000 in a
five-year campaign of national public
ity and advertising to settle and de
velope the cut-over lands of the Gulf
coast country, bring in new invest
ment capital and attract wealthy
tourists. Henry Hall, president of
the First National Bank of Mobile, is
president of this league.
The Southern Pine Association is
back of a big movement to advertise
cut-over pine lands in Georgia, Flori
da, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma, and
to colonize them with desirable Amer
ican homeseekers from the congested
and war-wealthy sections of the
north, east and middle west. The
pine forests are fast being denuded,
and productive cultivation must take
the place of lumber cutting. Satsu
ma orange growing is one of the fac
tors of greatest interest and import
ance.
Rice, a staple in the southern Gulf
coast region and a luxury up north,
is next on the program for extensive
propaganda. After many years of
lack of co-ordination, the growers and
millers have at last gotten together
in a well-defined program to nation
ally exploit this wonderfully nutri
tious food.
Bankers all over the south report
phenomenal increase in deposits, and
trade prosperity is forging ahead by
leaps and bounds. The Literary Di
gest recently devoted several pages of
a leading article on the gathering
prosperity in the south, and predict
ed a great wave of wealth accumula
tion and enormous new investment
and economic development in this re
gion, that will command the interest
and attention of the entire nation.
The south is in the spotlight and bids
fair to remain there for years to
come.
RICE AS A NATIONAL FOOD.
Country-Wide Advertising Campaign
Planned by Growers of Cereal.
Speaker Champ Clark's open advo
Sricea_ a.-nati al t a
3ther food products are soaring in
price, has given impulse to the move
nent now definitely under way to ad
vertise southern rice to the whole
country. The Democratic speaker in
in interview from Washington, pub
lished broadcast, said: "Rice is too
fenerally overlooked in this country.
[ was surprised to hear the other day
;hat five cents worth of rice will serve
is a substitute for bread for an en
;ire day in a family of six people."
The rice eaters of Louisiana, Tex
is, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida,
Georgia and South Carolina know this
;o be true, but the millions of people
n the north and east know rice only
is a dessert.
Now come the Southern Rice Grow
ýrs' Association and the Rice Millers'
kssociation with a definite plan to
educate these millions to the virtues
if rice as a cheap and daily diet. At
i recent meeting in Beaumont they
esolved to raise from among rice
;rowing and milling interests a large
und for a continuous campaign for
he academic advertising of rice. The
,rowers and millers will be asked to
at up a small assessment per bag for
hree or more years, and the aggre
,ate thus accumulated will enable
hem not only to grow and sell rice
n larger quantities but for higher
)rices. And yet the price will be low
r than that of other foodstuffs.
A committee of the combined in
erests headed by Jos. Broussard,
rresident of the Rice Millers' Associa
ion at Beaumont, with Frank God
haux, A. Alton Foster, E. A. Eignus
nd Dr. Geo. W. Collier, are now cir
ulating the subscription contract.
nother committee, on organization,
omposed of W. B. Dunlap, chairman,
)r. P. II. Saunders and S. Locke
reaux, is preparing charter and by
aws.
Bag manufacturers, rice farm im
ilement companies, and all directly
nterested in rice are expected to con
ribute to the fund for making rice a
iational food.
