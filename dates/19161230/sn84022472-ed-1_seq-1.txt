There is ho law in this state r
quiring marking of eggs, but there is
a measure against stale eggs being
displayed as fresh, or mixed with
eggs displayed as fresh. The dairy
commissioner said the. law will be en
forced to the limit.; ' -There. '4s also! a
federal law. preventing dealers from
displaying as fresh eggs those taken
from1 cold storage for interstate com
merce shipment. -.
It has been found that aome? state
dealers have labeled their cold stor
age eggs- with such' signs as Yorlc
State Eggs" or, "Massachusetts Eggs."
This, in the "opinion of .Cornmissioner
Stadtmueller, is evading - the law af
fecting the display of stale eggs and
a direct misrepresentation. "Accord
ing to the commissioner, there .are
some points of the state law. regard
ing eggs which .will have to be made
clear sooner or later, but at present
he is making an effort to make dealers'
recognize . the fact that stale 'eggs
must not ' be displayed . as ; "fresh."
One the 1 whole, Mr. Stadtmueller
says, the egg situation is gVod in this:
state, and he .believes Connecticut's
egg supply is on a high' plane when
compared with the surrounding
states. " . i : '",
-,Thec egg situation in this state is of
unusual Interest at present, owing to
the turmoil caused in New. York by

New York state . egg dealers by ' John

markets, demanding under threats'-"of
prosecution, that . they " immediately
begin' marking thr dates of packing

come from New York. ' ' : '
Similar violations as reported from
Bridgeport are : said "to have' been

Gordon Gives Out Statement
But Sidesteps Telling

trian. " .
, The charities department today sent
investigators to find Tony Marnoski,
who lay in a doorway at 84 State street
with a split head for more than 30
minutes, a .because the attaches of the
emergency hospital refused to send
any ambulance to the scene. He was
finally taken to the emergency hos
pital . In .a passing automobile and dif
ficulty Cwas then had to obtain treat
ment ,f or, him
K This action was taken as a result
of "statement made : that the emer
gency hospital has refused to , send
the ambulance to the scene where
persons, have been injured , and . the
charge that for 14 hours John Youngs
for -whom the police, six times asked
that aid be given, was neglected, .with
the result that he died , in a Water
street lodging houseV.
Supt. Spencer R. Gordon has emerg
ed from his ' state of reticence long
enough to state that a Woman, Mrs.
Mary .Mbroto, who died after her re
moval with her husband and baby to
the hospital from the basement of a
house.' in North Washington avenue,
came to her . end, as a result ol gas
poisoning and not neglect .or malnu-.
trition" from which Keri'aby and hud
band wf re found to be suffering. The
medical examiner's report states the
mother died as a result of two pols
onsgas and. foul food. . . .
He had no comment to 'make on
the . case of Mrs. Kate Devitt, who
was arrested on charges of drunken
ifess, on the -finding of a doctor whom
the police called into examine-? the
woman. ,;. It was found that her con-,
dition was due to a f raqturt ; of .the
skull and hip and. he ' is ;now- dylngf
at the Galen hospital, 'j' '
No denial was forthcoming on the
neglect, which resulted in the death
of John; Youngsv Gordon would not.
deny that policemen had for 14 hours
tried .in vain . to get aid for the dying
man, who -was suffering from pneu
monia; that the. Emergency flatly re
fused to send an ambulance to take
him to the hospital, or a doctor to
give treatment which might' have
saved his life. v
The only case upon which he has
commented is . that ef f the Moroto
womn,. whose death is now" alleged
by, prominent citizens as solely due
to poverty, r ' . ','
Whether or not the commissioners
of the Board, of Charities will send
to Hartford and ask C. N. Woodward
of that city, who protested ; indig
nantly against - the refusal of the
Emergency c hospital -to remove Mar
noski, from - the scene to testify at a
hearing.'; Mamoski, some: of the
charities employes now say, "suf
fered only a three-inch cut'.' in - the
head and was "not seriously injure'd."
An official today stated tnat ma not
change the status of the neglect
frhara-e. The policeman ' who found
the-man uhconseious thought his skull
mi irht ihave been . fractured. ; He was
lying in a pool of blood. He told this
to the emergency hospital over the
telephone, and stated he believed the
man's condition serious. Had Mar
noski been seriously; hurt this official
points out he could have, died' for all
the attention he - could get from, the
emergency hospital. .
J The policemen after waiting f or the
ambulance following the first call, a
half hour later, and finding when he
called a . second time that they would
not send the ambulance was about to
ask for the patrol when Woodward
volunteered to take Marnoski to the
hospital, and his offer was accepted.
Thft - investigation of these cases will
h made bv a committee of two mem-
roers of the board and their ; finding
reported to the president of the board.

FAIR PROTESTS
INNOCENCE OF
WIFE'S MURDER
Case of Alleged Slayer Will
- Not Reach Jury Until
Middle of Week. . .-
Although lie was subjected to a se
vere cross-examination yesterday af
ternoon in the criminal superior court,
William F. Fair stoutly denied he had
any knowledge of the death of Mar
garet Fair, for which he and Jack
Deveraux are being tried on a man
slaughter charge. Fair said he did not
know the body was lying in the yDa
rien woods and knew nothing of his
wife's death 'until he was arrested.
When called upon to tell just what
happened when his wife left the Da-
rien farm in June, 1914, Fair said he
was in the barn when Deveraux called
to him that Mrs. Fair was leaving.
The accused went out to the driveway
and saw his wfe. walking down the
road. When !he asked if she was com
ing back she replied that he would
hear from her. Fair's attention was
palled to a letter to a friend in which
he gave his wife's last words as "Not
on your life. You'll never see me
alive again." The accused claimedhe
didn't remember exactly what was
said. - .
When asked if he had not said in
discussion with two Darien friends
that a woman's body had been found
in the woods, the accused made a vig
orous " denial. He also denied having
told Mrs. W. M. Jackson of Darien
that the dead woman found in the
woods was net "his wife. The case will
probably not reach the jury until the
middle of next week. v '

It's Perfectly Permissible, Says Chairman Chew, Because
Such a Job for Warren Bros.. Co. Comes. Under the
Heading of "Permanent Paving Repairs M Requisi
tions Totaling More Than $3,000,000 Are Filed With
City Auditor Today Sewer Committee Asks Million
and a Quarter for the Coming Year.
v ,
Inconspicuous among requisitions totaling over $3,000,000
was the very modest request of the Paving & Sewer Com
mission for $57,040 in its budget filed with the city auditor td
day. . . V ' ' '
The requisition assumed real Jmporlancehowever, when
Chairman William Chew explained that the paving and sew
er commission, if the requisition is granted, is going to War :
renite some streets now paved with brick. .
Ten thousand dollars is asked by
the commission for pavement re
pairs. The balance is for "resurfac
ing", the following streets: '
South Main street, from Gil-
bert street, to the seawall.
East Main street, from Strat-
ford avenue to Ogden. street.
Stratford avenue, from Kos
suth street to East Main street.
Congress street, from Housa
. tonic avenue to Main street.
Chairman Chew said that the com
mission finds that, the brick pavement
on these streets is in poor condition,
and that further repairs with , brlcV.
are impossible. The bricks will be
taken up andMhe concrete vase util
ized for the surfacing.
"What surfacing material wirr be
used?" Mr. Chew was asked.
"We haven't decided that yet," Mr.
Chew said.
"Are the estimates based on War
renite figures?"
"Yes." . . ' . :V
- "Will Wavenite be used as the sur
facing material?"' T
"It wiU be considered." the chair
man said. , t . . ' . , . ..
The; surfacing of Congress street
with Warrenite, no doubt, will pro
voke some ; objections. .It has. been
found , that, Warrenite . on , sharp
grades make a very unsuitable pave
ments e nd aC6ngrss street is - a
heavy-; trucking' thoroughfare the
proposed Warreniting' willnot make
a' hit.' ',. v,".-.- '
. Mr. Chew further said that, while
the commission has ' nothing to ' do
with laying Warrenite ordinarily, this
is an exceptional case. The streets
to be resurfaced have concrete bases,
"so the work will rne under the
head of . permanent pavement re
pairs," he declared. ' ;
Requisitions filed today total nearly
as much as the entire appropriations
for 1916-1917. ; The only big budget
that was missing at noon was that of
the police department. . It was ex
pected that that department wuold
as for nearly half a million dollars.
The biggest requisition is for the
sewers committee . of the common
council, asking a total of U.245,000.
The next largest is that of the streets
and. sidewalks committee, totaling
$434,387.83.
The department of public works
wants $337,522.75. The charities
department - seeks $50,000 morpr than
was appropriated last year, its budget
totaling $25.3,849.51.
. These larger requisitions are item
ized as follows: " '
'Col. M. H. Rogers, H. H. DeLoss
and other members of the paving
commission resigned two years ' ago,
because of a dispute with Mayor Wil
son as to jurisdiction in the matter of
laying Warrenite. The mayor held
that the. expending of a pavement
bond issue didn't rest with the com
mission if it were spent'for Warrenite,
WHOLESALE SALARY RAISES ARE
ASKED BY HEALTH DEPARTMENT.
IN REQUISITION TO TAX BOARD
Bridgeport's augmented health de
partment, which became .augmented
during the brief reign here of Dr.
Abraham Sophian, wants to make its
presence . felt. . In the requisition
filed today by the health (board, with
the .city auditor, salary raises galore
of $100, $125, $200 and $300 are
sought. , ("
More than $615,0003 wanted -by the
health department, including funds for
an isolation hospital and the welfare
building.
The latter items are ex
pected to be stricken from' the last
and to be included in the next bond
ing appeal. f '
The list starts off with $3,600 for
Dr. W. H. Brown, the head of the
department. He was made health)
officer last night and the position of'
assistant health officer was created.
Dr. E. A. McDellan. who' resigned the
health oftlceship, was named assistant,
and $2,000 will be asked for him.
The board agreed that C. Howard
