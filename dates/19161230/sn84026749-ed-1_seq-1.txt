MILLIONS ARE
ADDED TO CITY
ASSESSMENTS
increase of $5,000,000
. Shown, Despite $40,000,000
Boost Two Years Ago.
FIGURES ARE GRATIFYING
Estimates More Than $400,-
000,000 as Compared With
$345,124,144.
Notwithstanding the fact that
realty values In the District were In
creased by 140.5100,000 two years ago,
a further increase of 10,000,000 la
shown In the biennial assessment Just
complete-.
Althouxh at first blush an Increase'
of 15,000.000 would, appear small for
city the also of Vshlngton for
twentyfour months, the boost Is con
sidered gratifying In view of the fact
that the $40,000,000 Increase was
made when the realty market was ex
reedlngly active, while for the last
two year activity has been limited to
specific arrax.
- Vtaald Have Been Store.
Had the nctlvlty been shown Ren
ernlly throughout tho District, as was
noticed In a few localities, tho In
crease would have exceeded $6,000.

the District Assessor office said.

the District today la moro than itOO,.

"Thn Increase of $5,000,000 s dis
tinctly a boost Instead of a knock for
the District." said 'Assessor Hlchards.
"When you remember that assess
ments were Increased by $40,000,000 at
one fell swoop two years ago, and the
Increase was based on usual real es
tate activity of the years of 1012 and
1U13, and then see a further Increase
of $3,000,000 In so short a time. It Is
a splendid sign that District values
are Increasing steadily and In a most
hoalthful way.
Practically Stationary.
"A study of assesmesntn In other
municipalities show that they remain
practically, stationary for several
years after si h ah enormous Increase
as was made hero two yeara ago,
"While It la true that there has not
been much activity In realty In the
District for the past two years, there
has been sufficient to justify an addi
tion of $3,000,000 to the assessment
figures because lanad and buildings
.huve Increased to that extent. It Is
doubtful fT any other city the also of
Washington could have shown an In
crease of $3,000,000 after the usual
boost of $40,000,000 In values so short
it time ago.

PERMIT FOR WRONG DATE

March 3 to March 4.
Through a mistake, the permit pro
cured by the Congressional Union for
Woinan Suffrage for the use of Penn
sylvania avenue for a demonstration
thn day before Inauguration was
dated March 3.
In making application to Major
Pullman for permission to use the
thoroughfare, tho suffragists neglect,
ed to keep In mind that inauguration
ceremonies will be held on March R,
because the regular dato falls on Sun
day. ")K Is the wish of the suffragists
that their demonstration bo held the
day before the Inauguration, and, ac
cordingly, an effort will be made to
da yto have tho permit dated March -I.
Major Pullman already has ex
pressed himself aa being willing to
allow the alteration, but the consent
of tho inaugural committee also will
have to be given, because of the tacit
agroement that control or the Avenue
shortly prior and subsequent to tho
Inauguration shall be vested In the

U. S. Enjoys Enonnouu 'Trade
. During Second Year
of War.
The United States, a,t tho opening of
a Ihlrd war-ridden year, will have
exported and Imported goods to tho
value of nearly $$,000,000000. Never
before has any nation rolled up such
a staggering total.
Of this trade, more than two-thirds
will represent exports, leaving a na
tional trade balance of approximately
IS.000,000,000 In the credit column.
The export trade has apparently yet
to reach Its apex, officials declared to
day. Jumping by leaps and bounds
on a rising scale for the past two
years, exports, ror tne pasi momn
attained another high-water mark.
More than an holf-btlllon dollars'
worth left American porta during the
thirty days $17,000,000 a day.
Imports, however, have declined

NEWLANDS THINKS
PROGRAM WILL WIN
Expresses Hope Railroad Legis
' lation Will Go Through in
Time to Avert Trouble.
Senator Newlands, cjialrmau of the
Interstate Commerce Committee, be
lieves the President's proposed rail
road legislation will be put through
Congress In time to avert open rup
turo through trouble that again
seems to, bo growing between the four
big brotherhoods and the railroad
executives.
Newlands admitted some Congress
lenders believe tho situation contains
serious possibilities, and Jie said he Is
lad work by his committee will be
rrsumed Immediately when Congress
reconvenes Tuesday.
It Is belloved Newlands will se the
President regarding the situation some
time between no wnnd Tuesdsy.
Prospect Not HelUked.
The possibility that Congress will
have on Its hands a proposition
something like the one of laat Sep
tember, when tho country fa:el a
llo-up, Is not rsllshed In either branch
of Congress, although many of the
critics of tho Adamson act say it Is
the logical outcome of the passage
of a hasty piece of legislation under
political pressure.
Scepticism over whetr the men will
strike Ise pronounced among Senators
and Congressmen. Still, they cannot
entirely Ignore the fact the brother,
hoods and railroad managers are In
disagreement, that the employes will
take a new strike vote, and that If
the Adamson law should be knocked
out by the Supreme Court, there
would be a chaotic conditions of
things.
May I'rge Plaa.
It was widely predicted today that
unless things cleared up the President
would be forced to back up hla rec
ommendation for a law on the order
of the Canadian disputes act.
He has recommended this, but since
recommending It In his annual mes
sage he has not pressed It, and the
opinion hus become strong In Con
gress that he would prefer to let It
alone nnd leave It to Congresa wheth
er to do anything.
When the Senate Interstate Com
merce Committee meets next Tuesday
to begin hearings on this recommen
dation of the President representa
tives of the roada and part or all of
the brotherhood chiefs will be present
Mat Ho Murk Oppcaltloa.
The idea of a wage-fixing com
mlsslo nund also the Idea of Federal
Investigation of railway disputes for
purposes bf publishing the facts to
the people have much support. The
brotherhoods are less opposed to Oov
ernment wage-fixing, under liberal
legislation, than to the Canadian plan.
Member of Congress are divided
on whether the court will uphold the
Adamson law.

URGES-NEW RAILWAY RULES
Revision Urged by Division of
Safety to Commerce Board.
A revision of rules and a change
In the practices pertaining to observ
ance or railroad caution signals was
urged today by tho chief of the divi

to failure or engineer to take proper
heed or caution signals.
Under present rules the engineer
are not required to stop when they
run against such a signal, but are
merely warned to be able to atop
Immediately. Many engineers, he
said, do nut even slow up when they
meet such a signal.
He urged stricter enforcement of

methods.

Importance or the document.
In England much significance In
connection with Germany's plea for
peace was seen in Gen. Sir Douglas
Halg'a review of the Sommo battle,
the Drltlsh commander-in-chief sum
marised the result of that fighting
with the statement:
"The Homme battle haa placed be

objf-cts ror which the allies ar fight
Ing. That Germany nt out her
peace feelers because she also realised
the Sommo offensive waa Indication
of her future defeat, waa suggested
today.
Moralag Peat's View.
The Morning Post took this view:
the moral is thst the battle
was scarcely cnded," the editorial de
clared, "ore aermsny aakedtf or peace."
Quoting Halg words, the editorial
concluded: "In these simple words,
which must resound In German oars
like thunder lies the whole explana
tion of the CJerman proposals. There
fore, all that the allies need to con
sider Is whether or not aermany will
concede the object for which the
allies are lighting or will prefer to
continue tu resist until her resistance
U broken. It follows also that any
suggestion made on the part or neu
trals that a compromise might bo ef
fected Is In fact an attempt to spar
Germany, and us such I a violation
of neutrality."
