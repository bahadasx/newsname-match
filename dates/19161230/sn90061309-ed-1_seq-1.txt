GRACE BAPTIST
Owing to the Christmas exercises
held on the evening before, the Sun
duy congregations were not so well
attended as usual. The services
were good however. The fire
whistle blew just at Sunday school
time and the superintendent was
forced to leave. The new assistant
took charge and did his duty
efficiently and well. We feel proud
of hitn Miss Margaret Fields has
been placed in charge of the very
small children those ranging in ag
from one to three We hope every
one will begin with the New Year
and regularly attend, the Sunday
school obligation rests upon every
member of the church to do this.
Rev. K. E. Magruder. who has
for several years been serving
churches in this section of (he state
dropped in and Drenched for us at
the evening service. Bro. Magruder
it will perhaps be remembered, held
a meeting fur the Harmony church
near Stouisville this last fall which
resulted in twenty-seven additions
to the churcii. His subject for the
evening was "The By-Products of
Grace" Text II Cov. 4-17.
It wus a message full of en
couragement and general helpful
ness. By the pastor it was heartily
welcomed, for we often long to hear
the yospel message from the lips of
other men.

Injured in Auto Accident
Last Saturday night about nine
o'clock Russel Crane and Russel
Phillips, two young men of the
Philadelphia neighborhood, met
with an automobile accident that
came near proving fatal to both.
and as it was both were badly cut
and bruised and were under the
care of a physician for a time. The
machine was a powerful Buick Six
belonging to W. L. Crane, who has
recently returned from New Mexico
and is badly wrecked. The accident
occured on the Philadelphia road
about a quarter of a mile west of
Palmyra near the Powell place,
formerly occupied by A. O. Redd.
ineoovss&y tney could not see
the turn in the road at the bottom
of the hill, and that the machine
went oo into the ditch, turning
completely over. Phillips was
thrown out but Crane was caught
under the steering wheel, and it is
remarkable that he was not killed
instantly. Palmyra Spectator.

There will be no services at

St.
An Unneutral Dog
A husky German saloon-keeper
outside one of the United States
army posts on the Mexican border
boasted that he had never lost a
cent in his dealings with the
soldiers. Private Dempsey, a former
comedian and ventriloquist, heard
what the German said and so it
happened that one day the propri
etor of the Treat or Travel, called
upon the Colonel and complained
"Colonel." he said, "a soldier came
by my saloon and bounced 10 cents
on the mahogany counter. 'Gif me
a glass of beer.' I gave hitn the
glass of beer and he turned to a
yellow dog what came mit him and
he say, 'Carlo, what you want?' Carlo
stood on his hind legs and said:
" I want a ham sandwich.' I look
ed at the dog and I lo iked at the
soldier, and I say: "Does that dog
talk like that all the time?" The
soldier said noddings, but the dog
said: "Sure. I talk better than
that old phonograph you got there."
I gave him the sandwich; then I
said to the soldier: "What you took
for that dog?" He said: "I don't
want to sold that dog.'.' Then I
said: 'He help my business here.
I II give you $50 for the dog " The
soldier whispered: "Give it to me."
And after he put the money in
his pocket he said to Carlo: "You're
soldi I hated to do it but I need the
money." Carlo looked up at the
soldier and said; 'Ben, if you sold
me to that old Dutchman I'll never
talk agaia" And, Colonel, the dog
did'nt."

Judge Alex. Wjller came to Paris
and took up the motion for new trial
in the case of the State of Missouri

reasons why a new trial should be
granted. It was presented by E. T
Fuller, attorney for Woodson, and
was opposed by Alex. T. Stuart
propecuting attorney, and James
P. Boyd, who represents the Law
