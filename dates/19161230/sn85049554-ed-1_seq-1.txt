FEARS JAPANESE SEIZURE
Withdrawal of U. S. From Philippines
Wpuld fiesult in Jap Occupation.
Cincinnati, O., Dec. 30. "If the
United States withdraws from the
Philippines will there be any guarantee
against the seizure of the islands by
another nation? I am -afraid not."
This was a statement made by James
H. Robertson, of Washington, who
spoke at the closing session of the
American Historical Association here
today.
"I can not believe that the Japanese
government, notwithstanding certain
public utterances, is desirous of annex
ing the islands, as Japan's lines of ex
pansion lie to the north and north
west. But I am certain that Japanese
Sterests
would demand the occupation
the islands in case of withdrawal by
the United States, if for no other rea
son than to forestall their occupation
by another nation. I should be sorry
to see this happen. It would mean the
loss ol an American experiment which
has attained valuable results. Neutral
iztion, formerly the catchword of the
politician, is now seldom heard. Bel
gium's fate settled that."

"Tdur Congi^saman Wood started this

Not Quit Monday.^
UNION MUST FIRST
RECEIVE NOTICE
Circular Letters Explaining Break Be
tween Committee and Railway Man
agers Not Yet Issued—No Immediate
Strike in Prospect—Senate to Pro
ceed With Railroad Legislative Pro
gram.
Cleveland, O., Dec. 30.—Warren E.
Stone and W. E. Lee, heads o£ the
railway engineers and trainmen respec
tively, arrived here today, following
the rejection of the demand by -he
managers' committee that the Adam
son law be placed In effect Jan. 1.
"It is highly improbable thai there
will be a strike .Monday," Stone said.
He declared thai the report that a cir
cular letter had been sent to railway
employes asking for a renewal of au
thority to call a general strike was un
true. "No circular has yet been pre
pared," he said.
Stone said no further statement
would be forthcoming today and that
there would be no meeting of the
brotherhood heads. It was pointed out
that a general strike Monday was an
impossibility because of the fact that
railroad unions would first have to be
notified of such intention.
Lee said he had nothing to add to the
statement given out yesterda\' in New
York. "There will be no immediate
strike," he asserted.
Veiled Threat of Strike?
Yesterday the four chiefs issued a
somewhat cryptic statement over their
signatures declaring that the attitude
of the railroads threatened to wipe out
the benefits that should accrue to the
men from the passage of the Adamson
act and asserting that for that reason
"the entire situation Is to be p««ed
before the membership."
The chlcfs refused to say whether
the action was a veiled threat of an
other strike vote suoh as brought about
the eight-hour day legislation. The
statement follows:
"While meeting with President WH*
son last August, at hi? insistence, our
committee-waived- ttfeelr weakest for
time and a half for overtime, whicfi'
was fully SO per cent of their OTiginal
demand, and at the suggestion of th*
president, accepted his proposition,
which was:
"'Concession of the "eight-hour day.
Postponement of the other demand, as
to the payment for overtime, -and the
counter suggestion of the railway man
agers, until experience actually dis
closes the consequences of the eight
hour day.
'In the meantime, the constltution
by authority of the congress of a com
mission or body of men appointed by
the president, to observe, investigate,
and report upon these concession'
without recommendation.
Then such action upon the facts aa
the parties of the present controversy
may think beat.'
Muet Wait For Eight-Hour Law.
"Our men believed, in1 so doing, they
would secure the eight-hour basic day
at once, but the enactment of the
Adamson eight-hour law, effective Jan,
1, 1917, made It necessary for them to
wait patiently until that time, to flnd
later that the railroad companies Insti
tuted Injunction proceedings against the
government's enforcement of the eight
hour law, and at this time the entiro
matter is in litigation, such litigation
making it impossible for the special
committee, appointed by the president,
as provided for in the law, to proceed
with their Investigation as of Jan. 1.
'The probability of additional liti
gation being commenced by the rail
roads, even tho the law Is declared
constitutional by the supreme oourt,
will fierlously affect such investigation,
in fact, can and likely will delay the
investigation until the commission can
not make its investigation as the law
contemplates, thereby defeating the In
tent of the law and at the same time
postpone the benefits promised by the
law, which will unquestionably meet
with general dissatisfaction among the
membership of the railroad organiza
tions.
The entire situation is to be placed
before the membership by special cir
cular."
Refueo to Amplify Statement.
The brotherhood chiefs declined
positively to interpret their statement.
Mr. Lee was asked to explain whether
the statement meant a new strike
vote might be ordered.
"You may make your own interpre
tation," was the reply.
"What interpretation is the public
to make?" he was asked.
"Let the public make its own inter
pretation. We don't care what conclu
sions they draw."
Legialation to Proceed.
Washington, Dec. 30.-—Chairman
Newlands, of the senate Interstate
commerce committee, said today the
failure of the railroad brotherhood of
iflcials and railroad managers to reach
an agreement regarding an eight-hour
schedule would not alter the plans for
consideration of railroad legislation
urged by President Wilson In his last
message to congress.
"We will proceed as usual but with
expedition, I hope,' 'said Senator New
lands. "I do not know JUst' who will
appear before the committee Tuesday,
but representatives of the brotherhoods
the railroad companies and the general
public have been invited and I hope
that legislation can be given early con
sideration In the house.'

ALLIED SHIPS COMB ATLANTIC.
Light Cruisers and Armed Merchant
men Watch For Raiders.
New York, Dec. 30.—When the
American oil tank steamer Sliver
Shell arrived her^ fruin Bordeaux In
bullast after taklns a carno of oil
to France its officers reported that it
had been stopped by a British cruiser
on Dec. 17 north-noJtheaat of the
Azores. The cruiser sent a boat with
an officer, who examined Its papers,
after which the Silver Shell was al
lowed to proceed.
It was reported In maritime circles
today that the, British cruiser squad
ron made up of light cruisers and con
verted merchantmen, is maintaining a
patrol along the transatlantic lanes.
This patrol was sa.id to have been
augmented by several French cruisers
and armed merchantmen, among the
latter the French liners Savoie and
Lorraine.
In the British auxiliary fleet are be
lieved to be the Cunarders Caronia and
Campania, the White Star liners Teu
tonic and Megantic. and the 26,000 ton
Belgenlanil, which was being built fo'
the Red Star line when the war
started. It was renamed t\e Homeric.
This report taken in connection
with t\e holding up of the Silver Sheel
in mid-ocean is Interpreted by shipping
men as showing that the British ad
miralty has spread a network of war
vessels over the entire north Atlantic
in an effort to catch German subma
rine'! and raiders.
It was whispered in shipping circle#
that the Cunard lines were to be fitted
with six-inch guns, fore and aft. Offi
cials of the line denied knowledge of
such a move.
MARINE INSURANCE
RATES INCREASED
Advance Attributed to Reports That
Liner Voltaire Has Been Captured
and that Several Trans-Atlantic
Liners Are Overdue.
New York, Dec. 30.—.Marine insur
ance rates today showed another in
crease. Underwriters rates showed
to 8 per cent for cargoes bound to the
United Kingdom and 10 per cent to
Mediterranean ports.
The advance was attributed to the
reports that the Lambert & Holt liner
Voltaire, long overdue, had been cap
tured by a German prize crew which
Was preying on allied.freighters in the
r.ci'th Atlantic, ancj to the fact that
several trans-Atlantic steamers are
now overdue on both sides of the ocea.n.
Altho the Voltaire, from Liverpool to
New York, la fourteen days behind her
schedule, representatives of the line
here said they had not given up hope
and would not do so until they heard
officially that their vessel had been
loat. in maritime circles it was pointed
out that anxiety oyer the non-arrival
of steamers is unnecessarily exagger
ated. Because of fbugh weather, it is
said, some Steamers are taklhg^froin
twenty*ihrap io, Ut'entyi^Bh.t da»/to
(nVtsTTiattr firrf«sifr and^rerreh Sports
and (from Geona Jand Marseilles they
have been as long a* thirty-eight days
out. Underwriters say it is difficult to
know just when a vessel "Teft a British
port for New York, as the government
might order her into another port
where she might be detained a week or
more.
RECORD INFLOW OF GOLD.
YeaKa Imports Reach Enormous Total
of $684,700,000.
New York, Dec. 30.—The inflow of
gold this week carried the total of the

is by far the greatest amount of gold
to enter the United States in a single
year.
The total of imports for the week in
behalf of the British treasury amounts
to $53,600,000. The heavy expansion
of shipments since last 'Monday is tak
en in banking circles as an indication
that the British authorities are plan
ning to continue sending gold here on
an enormous scale.

Withdrawal of Pershing's Force Said
to Be Only Solution of Controversy
Between Mexico and United States—
The Mexican View.
ordered ro
Washington. Dee. SO. Counselor
Polk at the staste department, and
Charles H. Douglas, local attorney for
the Carranza government, conferred
today over the Mexican situation.
Mr. Douglas declined to comment and
Information concerning the conference
was wtthheld by department officiate.
It was understood, however, that a
suggestion was presented that the
voluntary withdrawal of American
troops from Mexico would go far
toward clarifying the situation.
Mr. Douglas believes the only solu
tion of the problem Ib to 'be found by
this government withdrawing upon its
own responsibility the Pershing forces
and agreeing to a further discussion of
other Mexican difficulties by the com
missioners.
It was explained that Carranza's
failure to sign the agreement was due
to the provisions Imposed with ref
erence to a possible continuance of
bandit activity in northern Mexico.
Had Carranza signed the agreement.
Mexican officials say, he would in the
event of another bandit raid into
American territory ,and pursuit by
American soldiers into 'Mexico, have In
effect legalized the reoccupation of
Mexican territory by United States
military forces and would have
jeopardized the d« facto government's
chance of restoring order south of the
border.
