THE ST. JOSEPH OBSERVER
AGREATGAIN
The J-arjest Surplus In the History
.of the Post Office .Department
Is Shown By .Democrats
The old cry bo vociferously whooped
up by the Republicans to the effect
lhat the Democrats did not know how
to run the .finances of this country is
.again .shown to bo fallacious by the
report of the financier of the post of
.flee department, our own Gov. Dock
ery which shows that In that depart
jnent the largest surplus, 15,216,243.61,
was realized in 1916, while never In
any of the years that the Republicans
were In control was there anything
but a deficit as the records will show.
""In his report Gov. Dockery points
out that the 1916 surplus is the third
in the four successive fiscal years of
the Wilson administration. The deficit
in the fiscal year 1915, he asserts, was
caused by the decline in postal
revenues that began In July, Imme
diately preceding the outbreak of the
European wax, and continuing in
varying degrees throughout the en
tire year.
"It is clearly apparent, therefore,"
Gov. Dockery says, "that the postal
service, If confronted with no abnor
mal conditions affecting its revenues,
is self sustaining."
Gov. Dockery evinced particular
pride In the growth of the postal sav-l
jngs sysiem unuer nis immeuiaiu
supervision. At his suggestion, con
gress this year amended the original
postal savings act removing the limit
on deposits and raising the credit bal
ance to $1,000 from $500.
"Tho'effect of this liberalizing legis
lation was an immediate and pro
nounced increase in postal savings de
posits," says Gov. Dockery. "As the
advantages of the new law become
known the accumulated hidden sav
ings of the country flow to the postal
basis, and are there restored to the
circulating medium.
"At the close of the fiscal year pos
tal Mavlngs deposits amounted to
$86,013,885, standing to the credit of
602,937 depositors, an average of
$142.67 (or each depositor. Compared
with the returns for the service at the
close of the previous fiscal year, there
was a gain of $20,335,177 in the
amount on deposit, 77,523 in the num
ber of depositors and $17.65 in the
average for each depositor."
The gain in Missouri was $337,711
the total for 1916 being $2,136,527 for
) J916, as against $1,799,356 for 1915,
ROLLING IN WEALTH
The Coin of the Whole Earth Seems
to Be Floating to Gay
New York
- New York - la rolling, revelling,
r rollicking In wealth.
This Is a "never-before-In-history"
story.
New York banks recently held re
serves of $816,794,200, and from every
quarter of the globe money is pouring
In actual yellow gold by tho millions
to be changed from the coin of other
nations Into the coin of tho U. S. A.
Wall street has become a gambling
table on to which is being thrown
money from the earnings, winnings
and savings of Americans and money
from the coffers of kings.
While the large majority of New
York's 6,000,000 are fighting the uni-
Friends

to each and every patron
to those who love it and
versal desperate battle with the uo&t
of living, on the surface it appears
that everybody has money to spend.
They are spending it for necessities
and luxuries.
Forty or more blocks in Manhattan
ar given over entirely to that ancient
tiio. "wine, women and song." "War
bride" dividends have gjven night
time Broadway a new life. Men who.se
business it is to take money from
spenders say they never were able to
take s.0 much of it before.
Ancient IJabylon could be set down
inside New York's winter pleasure
grounds without being noticed.
Nebuchadnezzer wouldn't have a repu
tation outside his own block.
Cabarets have sprung up like mush
rooms and dance halls thrive as in
any new gold camp.
"Business is three times as big as
the biggest we ever saw before this
jeason," said the manager of the
largest cabaret in the city.
Hotels are crowded, theatres are
.(old out. Crowds that the "shop early"
slogan do not account for fill the de
partment stores.
Warehouses are depleted of stocks
and deliveries are far behind.
New York is spending money and
getting what It can for it,
Hut It keeps pouring in. From
farmers in the west to at least one
monarch on an European throne they
are sending their money to New York.
The greater part of it Is emptied Into
that, section of the city included by
the name of Wall street.
EXPLAIN THE RIDDLE
What Is the Matter Deacon Dobyns,
Do You Really Mean What
You Say7
We simply cannot understand this
It Is past our comprehension in view
of our intimate acquulntunce with
wod Deacon Dobyns of the Holt
County Sentinel. In closing an ac
count of the suicide of William
Green, near Craig last week, in the
Sentinel appears this:
"His father died two or three years
ago, and was burled at the Wing cem
etery, east of Napier. His mother's
maiden name was Cloe Ellen Chaney,
and she committed suicide In Ray
county, about eight years ago, wo are
Informed. He leaves two brothers,
Manle and Virgil, who live In Rulo,
and an older sister, who Is a widow
with five children, living at or near
Maysvllle. The sister and brothers
left Tuesday noon, leaving the body
of their brother In tho care of the
undertaker, not being able to finance
the expense of the burial.

MARTIN'S CONDITION BAD
It Is Feared That His Affliction Is
Such That He Will Not
Recover
Information which reached here
Thursday from Chicago was to the
effect that B. Raleigh Martin, tho well
known attorney of this city, was In a
critical condition at Augustona hospi
tal in Chicago, and that tho prospects
were that he would not long survive.
Ho has been 111 since last August,
and transfusion of blood has been re
sorted to on several occasions since
ho was first taken to tho Chicago hos
pital. He Is suffering with pernicious
anaemia, and over a month ago his
physicians hold out little hope for him.
A LANDMARK GONE
The Famous Plant Founded by Ben
Holaday of Pony Express fame
Is being wrecked
George II. Baker has recently put
chased the distillery plant and
grounds of " the Shuwhan DliU-vry
company, the plan' is being wrecked,
but '.lie nineteen at.es will be cor
verted Into a dairy fr.rm.
The lapsing of the once famous
still house revives Interest In l's his
tory, which dates back to 184'J. In
that year Wlnslow & Holaday organ
ized, seruied all righU from thj gu
ermen'. lullt the historic old rock
still houre and begrn the manutac
ture of whiskey and for a lout; time
Its out out was famous throughout tlm
country. This was the distinguished
Den Holaday, instigator of the "pony
express" that carried mall from points
along the Missouri river to th. Paci
fic ocean also owner of beautiful
Ophlr farm near New York City. Be
fore the Civil war Ben Holaday was
a millionaire, but at the close of that
war the government failed to pay his
claims and he died a man of little
means In the far West. His Weston
home is now owned by Hhinehart
Unmesslg.
The next owner was the late Major
David Holaday, brother of Ben. He
was a man of refined bearing, charit
able and gentlemanly In every sense
of the word. His daughter. Mrs.
Clara Barton, now owns and lives In
the David Holaday home. At his
death the distillery was sold to the
late George Shawhan, who revived its
old prestige and showed a marked in
crease in business. Mr. Shawhan
built and lived In the palatial homt
now owned and occupied by Mr. and
Mrs. C. D. Benner. With the passing
of Mr. Shawhan and his distributing
agents Morrin & Powers of Kansas
City, the business decreased, so now
it becomes the property of Mr. Baker
as stated above. There is a splendid
spring on the place which made it a
suitable site for the manufacture of
whiskey as the purest water is re
quired .however this is a valuable
asset for a tlairj farm, also.
A little later as the plant is torn
down, there will be a wreckage sale,
notice of which will be given in this
paper. It must be said with all due
respect to all concerned, that this
distillery has always been conducted
in a stralghtfonvntd manner, accord
ing to law. There was never any
rowdyism around It and all the own
ers, also the gaugers, distillers and
others who worked .there, were men
who valued their own reputation as
well as that of the plant. Weston

WHAT IT COST
The Democrats Spent a Neat Little
Pile In the Election Held Last
November
Just to be entirely exact, It may be
stated that the Missouri state Demo
cratic central commltttee spent $126,
555.47 during the recent campaign, ac
cording to the report filed by Dale
S. Flowers, treasurer of the commit'
tee. The amount was paid out In
almost two thousand checks, by Doc
Brydon, and the bills cover many dif
ferent items. The committee received
$127,99C43.
The repot t filed by the treasurer
consists of 61 pages of closely type
written matter, most of which were
filled. The receipts are listed on 22
pages, and there were approximately
1,500 separate items included. Many
of the items included from a dozen to
probably hundreds of contributors.
The largest single Individual contrib
utors are Edw. F. Goltra and Russell
E, Gardner, both of St. Louis, each
of whom gave $2,500. The report sub
mitted by Doc Brydon covers 39 pages.
A large part of the disbursements
went for speakers, big tents and print
ing and advertising.
Tho Democratic national committee
sent $48,000 to the state. Col. F. D.
Gardner contributed $1,000, Senator
W. J. Stone $750 and Senator J. A.
Reed $500.
NOT AN INAPPROPRIATE REPLY
Just before school closed for tho
Christmas holidays Miss Frances Bur

addressing one of the classes and
while so doing was telling the story
of Little Red 'Riding Hood and then
as she was concluding she said:
"Suddenly Red Riding Hood heard
a great noise. She turned around,
and what do you suppose she. saw

showing all his teeth?"

FOR CHIP CLARK
He Is in The Same Position as
He Declared Was Presi
dent Wilson !
MUST HAVE SOME
INDEPENDENTS
The Latter Will Hold the Balance of
Power When the Next House Is
Organized and There Is Trouble1
Ahead for Missouri's Great Son
Whom All But Those Who Are !
Radically Opposed to Him in Poll
tics Would Like to See Returned to j
the Speaker's Chair Which He Has
So Fittingly Graced
Every Missourian, almost irrespec-'
tive of party, wants to see this state's
great son, Champ Clark, sent back to I
the speaker's chair when the House1
reorganizes, but this time our owni
Champ will from ail indications have
some of that "hoss race," which he
stated early in the campaign that
President Wilson would have. All,
Miss-ourians, however, hope for the'
best.
The revised figures which are now
in now show definitely that neither
Democrats nor Republicans will havej
a majority of the next house neces-,
sary to elect a speaker and that a
handful of independents will deter-,
mine which side will control the
organization.
Conceding seats to candidates in po
sesMon or certificates of election, be
cause they are certain to participate
in the organization of the house, the"
personnel now stands:
Republicans 214, Democrats 213, In
dependents 2, Progressives 2, Prohibi
tionist 1, Socialist 1, contested 2. A
majority is 21b, hence, should either.
Democrats or Republicans win both
of the contests, they still would be
short of a majority.
Independents Are Silent
All of the Independents are main
taining strict silence regarding their
attitude on the speakership, but the
Democratic and Republican leaders
agreed on how most of them will ote,
provided caucuses are held and
solidarity maintained by the two old
parties.
Kelley of Pennsylvania, a progres
sive who formerly was a Democratic
member of the house, is listed as a
Democratic probability.
So are Randall, Prohibitionist of
California, who voted for Speaker
Clark, the last time, and . London of
New York, Socialist, sits on the Demo
cratic side now and has been shown
faors by Democratic leaders.
Shall of Minnesota, Progressive, the
leaders agree, probably would lean
toward a Republican candidate if con
vinced of his progresslvelsm. He cam
paigned for the national Republican
ticket during the last campaign, al
though opposed by the regular organ
ization in his state. Fuller, Independ
ent, of Massachusetts, also Is classed
as a Republican hope.
A Democratic Hope
Martin of Louisiana, Progressive,
comes from a large sugar district of
Louisiana, and has indicated that as
surance of protection of the sugar in
terest would be his first concern in
voting on the organization. He for
merly was a Democrat, however, and
Democratic leaders hope to get hla
vote.
Contests in which certificates have
not been Issued are on In the Thirty
second Pennsylvania district, where
Representative Barchfield, Republican,
is contesting the election of Guy E.
Campbell, Democrat, who, on the face
of the returns, won by forty-six votes,
and the Third New Jersey district,
where Representative Scully, Demo
crat, is opposing the election of Rob
ert Carson, Republican. Scully now
Is reported to have a lead of 125 votes
on the iecount, but there still are
about 3,000 votes to be passed upon by
tho courts. At 'east twenty seats, It
is said, will be contested In the house
after It is organized.
The Possibilities As Seen
Should the Republicans seat both f
their contestants and bold other mem
bership solid for their candidate, they
would need only two in six votes to
win the speakership, while the Demo
crats would need five. On the other
hand, should the Democrats win the
contested Beats, the Republicans
would need four In six votes while
the Democrats could win with three
votes.
There is no question about the Dem-
OSS
of.vatH voting solidly for Speaker
Clark, but there are some sign of
strife among the Republicans. Repre
sentatie Gardner already has an
nounced his opposition to Renrpiaat
tlve Mann. Every effort Wi- rix -n. id
by leaders, however, to have the solid
support of Republicans assured in con
ference before voting starts.
Anyway that may be it will be a
"hoss race."
HESSE AND MAYES
They Tell This One on a Klndergar.
ten Teacher Who Lives Out
Their Way
John Hesse and Nat Mayes tell this
of course for the truth. The public
can draw its own conclusions, how
ever. They say that the other night
as they were going home on a Jule
street car that a kindergarten teach
er entered the car and seeing a gen
tleman whoi-e face looked familiar to
her, seated near Hesse and Mayes,
said to him, "Good evening."
The gentleman seemed somewhat
surprised and she soon realize 1 that
she had spoken to a stranger.
Much confused, she explained:
"When I first saw you I thought you
were the father of two of my chil
dren." GORDON TO CONTEST
The State Auditor Charges That
Fraud Was Perpetuated Against
.Him in Several Counties
As a result of an investigation made
by State Auditor John P. Gordon, he
has instituted contest proceedings
against George E. Hackman of St.
Louis who on the face of the returns
claims to have been elected state audi
tor by a plurality of 9,000 votes. The
announcement of the filing of the
contest proceedings came as a sur
prise to many of the voters of the
state.
In his petition filed Gordon contends
that fraudulent votes were cast
against him in the city of St. Louis,
and in Warren, St. Louis, and Frank
lin counties. ,
The present auditor declared he
should have been elected by a plural
ity of 6,300 votes. His petition sets
forth that sufficient illegal votes were
cast and enough votes stolen to have
elected him by a pulrality of 6,0im
votes.
A TRAGIC TALE OF THE PRESENT
(Author unknown)
Unseen and unheard, through the ele
gant room
Where the rich millionairess lay
sleeping,
His form neatly swathed in the
velvety gloom,
A hard-featured burglar came creep
ing. He moved through the chamber with
scoundrelly stealth,
And levelled a gun at her head.
Unmoved by her beauty, unawed by
her wealth,
"Come up with your Jewels!" he
said.
The rich millionairess arose with a
start,
Disguising her rising dismay.
She never so much as remarked:
"Have a heart!"
But said to the knave, "Step this
way!"
She led him downstairs where the ice
box was kept
And opened It, so he could see,
The steak and the eggs, and she bit
terly wept,
"These here are my Jewels!" said
she.
The burglar was cut to his quivering
quick
By the rich millionairess' act.
And though, like most burglars, the
rascal was thick,
He showed quite unusual tact.
"I never took grub off a lady," he
said;
"A hobo I've never been yet"
And he blew through tho door, or, in
other words, lied,
For that night he had already et!

OLD DADDY FLYNN SORE
After He Had Kicked and Pirouetted
For Six Weeks They Gave Him
Thirty Dollars
Old Daddy Flynn, one of the numer
ous fad and cult fakers too lazy to
work and who feel that the world
owes them a living without work had
worked impressionable Kansas City
for six weeks with his health fake, but
left in disgust Saturday night when
his audience would not dig up "easy
money" and he told his audience Just
how he felt about it too. The Times
in detailing the last night sceance,
says :
" 'I haven't been working, my old
head off here for money these last six
weeks. I haven't bothered about
finances. I knew you would take care
of that for me. No, I don't care about
the kale for its own sake. But I
should like to see by the size of your
shell-out tonight what you think of me
and what I've done for you here.' It
was Daddy Flynn making his farewell
appeal to his health class at the Grand
last night.
"And the class of nearly nine hun
dred answered. It clapped and
shouted. It became so fascinated with
this exercise that it kept It up for
I several minutes. Meanwhile the tin
plates went the rounds to get the
contribution that should show by its
I size just how deep (in the pocket)
was the appreciation of Daddy Flynn's
! health class for Daddy.
"Daddy looked hopeful. To while
I away the anxious moments he did a
cat-on-theback-fence parade along the
j railing of the right hand stage box.
I He went back, sat down lightly on the
mahogany settee. He gave a whoop
'and zallahed up and down the stage.
The collection was taken. It was car-
tried up to Daddy. He looked at it.
Some nine hundred members of his
I class had given him a love offering of
nearly $30. Not quite four cents
apiece.
"The result was some zip-zip ora
tory. Here are some samples: 'I'm
going to have a time while I'm alive.
.If thereV anything beyond the grave,
rGotl's''Eo?to5hdW ml-" f)ne jolly per
son in a congregation Is a godsend. Go
to church. Wake It up. And if the
preacher pulls anything worth while
give him a hand. It will startle the
deacons, but most of them are dead
anyway. The best applause I've ever
got anywhere I've got right here in
Kansas City. And that's about all I
have got out of you.
'"After this kind of a showdown
you can't ask for a transfer to heaven.
For God says no thief can enter the
Kingdom of Heaven. And you're a
pack of thieves. Want me to prove
it to you? Well, you can't any of you
say you're hard up. You've gone six
weeks now without breakfasts. That's
at least twenty-five cents a day. And
that money belongs to me. Did I get
it? I did not. Well, it's up to you.
God has to ram a stick of dynamite
under some people to wake 'em up.
And I ain't God, though I've done you
a lot more good than religion has done
most of you.
"'Say, the next man that comes
along and does what I've done for you,
give him a square deal, will you? Will
you do that much for poor old
Daddy?"'
THE WILD CRAB APPLE
It Will No Doubt Be Adopted as
the State Flower of
Missouri
The wild crab apple will likely be
the state flower if the legislature at
its coming session enacts Into law,
a resolution which was adopted at a
meeting of the State Horticulture
Society held In Kansas City this week.
In deciding on the wild crab apple
the society was guided by sentiment
throughout the state as reflected in
a poll taken by Mls3 Marie Goodman,
vice-president of the State Federation
of oWman's Clubs, a member of the
society's committee on an emblem.
Out of 890 votes returned the crab
apple received the highest number
376 with the wild rose second
308.
"All arguments favor the crab ap
ple," said Miss Goodman In her re
port. "In beauty It certainly Is as
exquisite as the wild rose, and it is
widely distributed ovei' Missouri."
CERTAINLY A VALUABLE PAPER
If you want to start the paper now
that friend will get the Democrat
from now until January 1, 1918, for
the price of $150. Try the experiment
once and see how charmingly It
works. It would be the handsome
thing for you to do, and the friend
would remember you oftencr than by
