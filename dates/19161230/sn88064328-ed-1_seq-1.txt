Ijectives were lacking fitly to

may be said of 1916 in turn,

feed our industrial machinery,
while at the same time purely do
mestic trade grew beyond the
most sanguine dreams of our
merchants and manufacturers. A
quieting 1 down in midyear, with
attendant free predictions of the
termination of war demand, mere
• :— •*"* mac

a TAI*Û IlOMf Qnn cf 111 lot'dfûi* /I nm n «1/I ^
fore new and still larger demands
were again met in the autumn
and early winter. "Not enougn
cars, labor or goods" was' a com
mon description of trade and in
dustry throughout many months.
Even toward the close of the year,
when nearly all lines were booked
for nine months ahead, and some
iron and steel lines were sold well
into 1918, when prices of com
modities, after rising to new
heights, had broken badly, due
largely to peace talk being in
jected into the situation, ther
were but few signs of a let-up in
active buying, or indications that
the conservatism so long oreached
was really acting as a brake upon
extraordinary purchasing. How
much of this late quietly down
was due to the usual year-end sea
sonal dullness it would be hard
to say. Some of it, as, for in
stance, the quiet and easing in
some cotton goods, was undoubt
edly due to a 4-cent break in raw
cotton.
AU this activity had occurred,
too, despite the fact that it was a
presidential ,year, one also of dis
turbed foreign relations and a
period of disappointing crop out
turn, which was made more man
ifest by large foreign 'buying of
vantage of natural conditions to
push prices of food to record
heights. This latter resulted in
a popular outburst against , high
living costs and the usual frenzied
exorts of public men, legislators
and others to find evidences of
monopolistic combinations affe<tf
ing the prices of the "peopled
food."
Some Financial Features.
'Exports of merchandise totaled
$5,460,000,000 in value, excelling
vantage of natural conditions to
! those for the previous calendar
I year by 55 per cent., and those
J for the year 1914 by 157 per cent.
j Imports aggregated $2,360.000,000 ;
exceeding 1915 and 1914 by 32
j per cent. Gold imports totaled
I $630,000,000, surpassing exports I
•by $'500,000,000. Our gross im
ports of gold during the war have
aggregated $1,100,000,000, and'and
the net imports $838,000.000, J
while our sales of merchandise
for the like period were consid
erably pver double our purchases.
Henc.e the estimates that we
j bought back $2,000,000,000 of
J American securities, and, in addi-jof
tion, became creditors for an ad
ditional $2,000,000,000 of foreign j
bonds or notes. As our export
trade has grown since the war be
gan, its character has gradually |
changed, and the early large ship- :
ments of foodstugs have become (
dwarfed, partly because of crop
shortages, by later enormous ex- 1
ports of manufactured goods-1
not all of these, by the way, mj
nitions—though it must be said
that our shipments to Entente ;
countries have far exceeded those 1
to the rest of the world. Onr
(rains in trade with the part of
the world at peace have hardly !
expanded as much as might have'
hee n hoped, though i, is hard to |
see how our factory production, ;
in no^,t aS n 17? t0 i /"S"
in* point, could have been furth
er increased. Credits based on
a °? •»»"« ° f s
curities and gold have expand
ed, and the country's banking po
«üon has become one of nnpar- of
alleled deposits and resources.
'Bank clearings for 1916 testified
to the enormous volume of the
banking movement in a total of
$260,000,000,000, a sum never be
fore equaled, and a gain of 40 per
cent, over the 1915 high record
and of 69 per cent, over 1914. If I

Price Movements.
7^ "orcmenw.
As pointed out elsewhere, the
crop outturn was not in keeping
with other developments, and
this cause as much as to active!
foreign demands were due the
new and dizzy heights reached by
many commodities included in
Bradstreet's Index Number, which
latter rose steadily early in thç
year, faltered in the late spring
and sijpnmer, and then took a new
flight .to still higher ground as
crop' shortages became certainties,
active industry swelled pay rolls,
and a snowstorm of wage advan
ces in the latter months by a pro
cess of an endless chain character
still further advanced all* price
quotations. This process, result
ing in a reduction of the dollar's
buying ability of 23 per cent, as
compared with the year'a open
ing, was ultimately responsible
for a sort of popular revoit
agamst high food prices,
ÜMtomea «gainai foot
; hunts for the causes of advancing
prices. That some of the prices.
That some of the price advances
; were bred of speculation, made
possible by cheap and abundant
money, seems certain; that some
I were whatm ay be called psychc
'logical or auto-suggestive may be
conceded, but that short yield*
and'and unexampled demand were
J the main causes hardly requires
proof. The fact that Bradstreet 's
Index Number for the entire year
1916 was 20 per cent, above li'l.j,
33 per cent, above 1914, 32 per
cent, above 1910—the last year
food price revolts and meat
boycotts—and just double that of
j the low -water year 1896, is a vis
able statistical exemplification of
what have been called the "pen
| alties of prosperity."
