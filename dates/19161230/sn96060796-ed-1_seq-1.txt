Northern Arizona needs a few
thousand more farmers who have
money enough, nerve enough
and sense enough to combine
dry farming methods with mo
dest rainfall and develop diver
sified enterprises of crop rais
ing, stock raising, fruit rais
ing, etc.
The returns from the two tons
of tnrkeys shipped out of hereto
Armour & Co., for the Thanks
giving market come in this week
and gave the raisers 26 cents m
pound for their stock, instead of
the 24 cents agreed to. The ex
tra bonus was due to the choice
birds sent from this district.

The Phoenix Chamber of Com
merce recently issued a booklet
on thesubjectof cotton growing,
giving all the desired informa
tion. Hundreds of these books
have been distributed to growers
and prospective groovers of
cotton in this state. The data is
of great benefit to growers, as it
tells the best methods to follow
to secure the greatest results.
Committees from the "Phoenix
chamber of commerce and the
Rotary club have been selected
for the purpose of working with
the Arizona state fair commis
sioners in an effort to secure a
substantial appropriation from
the legislature which convences
next month. It is planed to use
the money, in the event it is
secured, to construct new build
ings and beautify the fair
grounds. Tucson Star.
Charles Stewart of Phoenix,
last month raaiketed 1,500 hogs
in Kansas City to good profit.
This again prompts the remark
that there is no better country in
the world than southern Arizona,
for the hog business. Green
alfalfa the year around forms the
staple diet while all the grains
necessary for fattening purposes
are grown as successfully here
as anywhere some of them more
sd If interested, make inquiry.
For $1,000,000, the Holly
Sugar company has bought the
sugar factory of the South
western Sugar and Land com
pany at Glendale. Operations
will be resumed next season
provididg farmers will sign up a
sufficient acreage to Assure the
company of an adequate supply
of beets for next season's run.
Tbe Holly company owns and
operates plants in California and
Colorado, as well as at Sheridan,

Representative Stephens has
introduced a bill hi congress for
the purjjose of securing reim
bursement to the state for
money expended in protecting
the border and fighting Indians
by Texas rangers away back in
1866 76. Congressman Stephens
was a scout in those days and
is well equipped to imform his
colleagues of the character of
the services rendered by the
Texans against Hostile Indians
and lawless Mexicans. .
It is estimated that there are
from fifty to sixty thousand head
of dairy stock in tbe Salt River
valley, yet the creameries are
paying the highest prices ever
paid for butterfat and cannot get
enough of it. All dairy products
are in big demand at top prices.
This valley needs a thousand
more dairymen with just money
enough to start themselves in
the business. The same condi
tions in relative proportions,
obtain in nearly every part of
the state.
Next Monday J. R. Treat will
put a force of men to work clear
ing off 400 acres of his land just
across the river from Florence,
300 of which will be planted to
long staple cotten in the spring.
A deal is practically all closed
whereby four men from the Salt
River valley will put in the
cotton. Tncso men have had
several years experience in cot
ton growing iu the. Salt River
valley and in the Yuma cotton
belt and feel confident that they
will make a success of cotton
growing here. Blade.
That a number of big mines
I will be developed in the Sup
ierior-Ray Christmas mineral
belt, and that this district, al
ready one of the important ones
of the state will become one of
the greatest in the Southwest is
the conviction of William F.
Gordon, mining engineer.
Arizona's oldest mining loca
tion has been found. It is in the
jxssession of Postmaster Met
calf of Kingman, and is dated
may 8, 1863. The location was
filed by a party of soldiers on
property now located in the San
Francisco minintr district, and
was found in 1902 by Charles
Buriock, present owner of the
old Moss mine.
Eastern financiers of interna
tional reputation are reported to
have taken over control of the
Miami Consolidated Mines com
pany as a result of payments
completed recently which have
placed nearly a quarter of a mil
lion dollars in circulation in the
Globe Miami district. These big
payments which were made to
the prospectors who originally
owned the property are consired
esiecial)y significant, as the tak
ing over control by the influential
easterners is expected to result
in laigely increased operations
on the property, which is re
garded as one of the most promis
ing of the junior coppers.
Deputy sheriffs in Ray have
orders to arrest everybody they
find carrying a bottle of iiquorT
and all persons so arrested will
be prosecuted for violation of the
new prohibition amendment
which forbids the transportation
of liquor from one point to
another withtn the state of Ariz
ona. Strict orders to nab every
man they catch carrying a bottle
of the Demon Alcohol- were
transmitted to Ray by Sheriff
Hall, who is making an energetic
campaign for the enforcement of
the law in Pinal county. Nine
persons charged with bootlegg
ing were fined in the superior
court last week, and stiff jail sen
tences were added by Judge
Baughn in a number of cases.
As a' result of the convictions,
the county treasury has been
enriched to the tune of approx
imately $1000. Copper Comp.
The poultry and egg business
is a winner almost anywhere in
Arizona. In the farm sections
where feed is cheapest it pros
pers most extensively, but even
is the mountain camps where the
feed has to be shipped in, the
high prices more than offset the
cost. But not every poultry
raiser makes money. Far from
it, for half the poultrymen do not
rise to the demands of their
business, either in catering to
the market or in attention to
their flocks and with judicious
management. We personally
know of flocks of two or three
hundred chickens that at this
season do not return more than
a dozen or two eggs a day. They
are eating their heads off and
giving nothing in return. In
flocks of similar size and almort,
within gun-shot distance, half or
twothirds of the birds are laying
every day. This is no fault of
anybody but the owners. And
eggs are 50 cents a dozen. Ari

The annual meeting of the
state board of trade was held
during fair week, in Phoenix.
Mr. Andrew Kimball was elect
ed president of the board and
other officers were changed
around and moved up. The im
portant feature of the meeting
was a decision to get all the
commercial bodies vigorously
behind the movement to make
big and successful show here
after at the national congresses,
especially the soils and pro
ducts, where such signal success
has already been achieved. The
board decided also to hold semi
annual instead of quarterly meet
ings anless there is some occa
sion for special meetings when
they may be called by the pre
sident. Prof." G..E. P. Smith
read to the convention which
heartily approved, a paper on
the need of a water code for the
state, presenting reasons that
many had not hitherto had call
ed to their attention. Arizona.
