OYSTER BOAT ST. CHARLES MISSING
MR. W. J. LOWRANGE GOES IN SEARCH
Left Tuesoay with Crew of Nine Men, Has Not Been
Seen Since. Louisiana Oyster & fish Co. Think
There is no occasiun for Alarm. Etta D Com
ing in Tonight May Bring News.
The St. Charles, an oyster dredge j
boat of the Louisiana Fish and Oys-1
ter Co. fleet may have encountered i
a storm on the reef, as n*> report |
from her or her crew has reached |
the officers of the company in Ber
wick since her departure for the
Diamond reef on Dec. 26th.
Shortly after the departure ofthe
St. Charles, the Ruth J a freight
boat belonging to the same company
started for the reef to bring back a
load of oysters. The Ruth J is a
freighter operating between the St.
Charles, the dredge boat and the
company factory in Berwick. The
Ruth J returned to port and report
ed that the St. Charles was not at
the Diamond reef and that no trace
of the boat could be found. Mr. W.
J. I.owrance, Presklent of the La.
Fish & Oyster Company immediately
made preparations to make a search
for the missing boat and the Ruth J
departed again yesterday with Mr.
Lowrance on board.
The Etta D, another freight boat
of the company is expected to arrive
tonight and may bring some news of
flie missing boat. In event that the
Edda D has found no trace of the
WHITE MAN HELD
IN EEVES MURDER
Four Negrois Say That Hy.
Walter is the Murdeter
Of Fanner who Had
' Money.
The confession of four negroes
held for the murder of Nelson
Reeves the farmer who with his fam
ily fell victim to a wholesale butch
ery at his home near Monroe has
caused the arrest of Henry Waller, a
white farmer 33 years old who was a
neighbor of the slain family. The
accused pleaded with the officers not
to let the mob get him and denied
the charge of wielding the axe in the
butchery. John Long another white
man has made a written confession
implicating Waller and the pair have
been removed to the Baton Rouge
jail for keeping.
See SHOES tonight, Opera House.
PARCELS MAILED EARLY HERE
Asked why there was no conges
tion in the local postoffice during the
last few days of the Xmas rush,
postmaster Hebert said this morning
that "He was inclined to give the
credit to the increased publicity of
the "Mail Your Parcels Early" pro
paganda, saying that with the Mor
gan City people it had been effective
and that the rush of the last few
days was with incoming parcels.
The postmaster this year furnish
ed the press with material on the ad
vantages of mailing parcels early,
and placed signs in various stores
and public places, as well as writing
to various clubs and organizations
urging the necessity of mailing par
cels early. By correspondence, by
addresses and through the press Mr.
Hebert did everything in his power
to see that there was no delay in the
Xmas presents mailed by Morgan
City citizens, and his success is now
a matter of record. The posai re
ceipts from Dec. 11th to 25th show
ed an increase of 35 per cent and
yet there was no time when the post
office was swanped.
See SHOES tonight, Opera House.
Mr. J. L. Bass bought $1500
worth of furs in Napoleonville yes
terday.
St. Charles, it is not likely that there
will be any news before Monday
when the Ruth J is expected to re
turn.
The St. Charles had nine men on
board. Those missing are Ben Reno,
Captain, Bert Autin and Will .Frau
menthal, engineer and fireman, cul
lers, Andrew Pizzini, Ernest Pizzini,
Francois Lombas, Andrew Gillory,
Victor Duprey and S. Hebert, all
white. #•
Wind from South
Officials from the La. Fish and
Oyster Co. say that there® is little
probability that the St. Charles en
encountdbed a storm as the wind was
from the south and would have like
ly blown the boat in to the shore.
They think it likely that the boat is
in one of the bayous, or that she was
obscured by a fog.,causing the crew
of the Ruth J to miss seeing her. It
is the opinion of Mrs. M. A. -Sutton,
secretary of the Louisiana Fish and
Oyster Company, also acting mana
ger in the absence of Mr. Lowrance,
that the boat is safe' and that the
crew is unaware of the easiness
caused by their failure to come in
contact with the Ruth J.
Contestants Must Turn In
Their Votes Today To Win
Monthly Prize
As the month draws to a close it
is timely advice to say to contes
i tnats that they must bring in votes
today of the expect them to count to
!ward winning the beautiful 26-piece
Silver Set and case which has been
displayed in the window of Fisher
Brothers, haberdashery for the past
few weeks. The winner of this set
will be made known Monday. Votes
in order to be counted in December
I must be turned before the month is
|gone. The Silver Sets for October
and November were won by contes
tants No. 217 and No. 240. This
! month it wiH go to another contes
tant as the rulçs of the contest will
not permit any contestant to win
more than one of these sets, how
ever, the votes to win this set
do cotint toward the winning of any
of the seven main prizes which will
be awarded on March 1st.
Some of the contestants have been
celebrating Xmas this week while
others have been hard at work,
realizing that this is a good time to
pile up a good bunch of votes. After
the first of the year it is expected
that everyone of the contestants
will get down to hard work and f make
every day count, as there will be but
two months left of the contest.
Sometimes these contests are very
close, and the difference between
the first and second prizes is only
one or two subscriptions and. then
the winner of .the second place al
ways thinks of fifty places where
they might have secured a subscrip
tion had he or she tried.
Dont forget to hustle for com
mercial printing. Many firms will
lay in a new supply of printed mat
ter after the first of the year and if
you fail to get your share of the
votes it will be your fault.
Watch for Monday's paper to see
who won the silver set and also
where you stand in the rac^.

We Hope Fire Won't Come
to your home during the com

bility that it may, and if it
does you should be prepared
for the consequences. It
seems to us s<> foolish when a
man says he doesn't need tire
insurance, that he has never
had a hre and doesn't expèet
to have one. When a fire
starts you can never tell
where it will end. Be pre
pared in any event by taking
