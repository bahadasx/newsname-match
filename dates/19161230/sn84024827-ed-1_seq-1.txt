WASHINGTON, Dec. 29. The three
Scandianvian nations, Norway, Swed
en and Denmark, through identical
notes, the Norwegian copy of which
was handed to the state department
today by Minister Bryn, hare express
ed lively interest in President Wil
son's proposals "looking towards tbe
establishment of a-durable peace,"
and their "deepest sympathy" with
all efforts to shorten the war.
Swiss With Wilson
Unlike the Swiss government which
offered to help in any way, "no mat
ter how modest," the Scandinavian
countries make no direct offer of co
ooeration. This fact attracted Dartic-
ular interest because Norway partic-'
ularly has been one of the greatest !
sufferers of the war among the neu- j
trtfls.
Norway's Note
The state department made public
the Norwegian note without comment,
and In-line with the policy of silence
adopted by President Wilson and Sec
retary Lansins, no other official" in
formation concerning peace moves
was forthcoming during the day. The
text of the note follows:
Applauds Wilson
"It is with the most' lively interest
that the Norwegian government has
learned of the proposals which the
President of the United States has
just made with the purpose of facili
tating' measures looking, toward the
establishment of a durable peace
while at the same time seeking to
avoid any further interference which
could cause pain to legitimate feel
ines. "The Norwegian government would
consider itself failing in its duties to
wards its own people and towards all
humanity if it did not express ' its
deepest sympathy with all efforts that
could contribute to put an end to the
war suffering and moral and material
losses. It has every hope that the in
itiative of President Wilson will ar
rive at a result worthy of the high
purpose which inspired it."
L?tins Are Silent
Most of the South American na
tions, it was indicated in diplomatic
quarters today, will not send com
munications regarding the President's
note on the official understanding that
it was addressed to them largely for
their own information and not to so
licit ction. Holland, whose attitude
has been the subject of much specu
lation, also was said to be unlikely to
take any action owing to the feeling
there that it might appear unneutral
to one side or the other and mitigate
against the location of. the eventual
peace conference in that country. Be
yond the fact that the Spanish cabinet
has not yet decided on Spain's action,
no further information has come to
the Spanish embassy today.
As to the belligerents. Turkey's re
ply to the President's note, practical
ly identical with those of Germany
and Austria, was made public by the
state department during the day, and
Bulgaria's is expected tomorrow.
Allies Reply Wednesday
Dispatches fro-n London that the
allies reply to the German proposals
was ready and probably would be sent
by Wednesday, followed shortly by
their reply to the President's note,
were read with interest here, but
drew no comment
Entente diplomats still profess to
be profoundly puzzled about the fun
damental purpose of the President's
note and are undecided whether it
was designed primarily to promote
T"ac or for America's own guidance.
They expect, however, that their gov
ernments' reply was short and appre
ciative. The real Impossibility of
peace would be adequately pointed
out in their lengthy reply to the cen
tral powers, where they can speak di
rectly and to the point, without fear
of wounding a friendly neutral.

SHORTAGE OF COAL.
PHOENIX. Doc. 29. The hteh

Carranza Buys Million Pesos'
Worth of Munitions From

Are Diverted There.
(By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO, Dec. 29. The Carranza
government has lately transmitted the
sum of a million pesos gold to Japan
in payment for war munitions, it was
learned here tonight from a well in
formed source. One shipment of muni-
. tions has already been received, ac
cording to this source, and the second
is due. It is said to consist of artil
lery shell and field guns, including
anti-aircraft cannon.
The same authority claims to have
information that the two new cartridge
factories established by the Carranza
government, with a capacity of 75,000
cartridges a day each, are equipped
with the latest type Of American ma
chinery, shipped and sold to a firm in
Spain and then reshipped to Mexico
by way of Vera Cruz.
When the rebel leader Zapata' oc
cupied Mexico City, he is known to
have sent away the machinery from
the old cartridge factory there to the
south for his own use. This machinery
was out of date.
Mexican newspapers at the time the
new factories were established gave
much space to describing their equip
ment, which they said was of the new
est pattern.

in a small lilibustering expedition
Christmas night, have moved south

Soon after crossing into Mexico,

WASHINGTON, Dec. 29. Hearings I
re-opened here today by the federal

end when paper manufacturers re

for raising prices to the extent of
forcing many small papers out of
business.
Manufacturers proposed the distri
bution plan at a hearing two weeks
ago. Today's hearing was a resump
tion of that proceeding, interrupted to
give the manufacturers time to give
the government cost of production fig
ures. It was declared that jobbers had
taken advantage of the last two weeks
to try to frighten publishers Into pay

WASHINGTON. Dec. 29. Continu-
I at ion of the conferences of the Mexl-
'. can-American joint commission, with
out regard to the question of with
drawing American troops from Mexi
co, is proposed by General Carranza
! in his message refusing to ratify the
I Atlantic Citv nroctocol. Cnnnleil with
I this suggestion, however, is a new ap-
! peal for recall of the Pershing expedi
' tion and a declaration that such act
i Ion by the United States would permit
adjustment of all remaining questions
"within a week."
May Again Confer
There were indications tonight that
the American members of the com
mission might be disposed to comply
with the request for further confer
ences on the ground that the United
States had nothing to lose by doing
so. It was officiary stated nothing
yet had occurred to alter the policy of
the administration toward Mexico and
it is generally understood that bo long
as Mexico is in the present condition,
Persking's rten will stay where they
are.
A copy of the Carranza communlca-
J tion was sent to President Wilson.
Secretary Lane communicated with
nr. .1. R Mntt and Judee Geo. Gray,
the other members of the American
coiiin'ision, and then announced that
they would met here Tuesday to de
termine whether further conferences
shall be held.
Carranza points out in his reply that
there was nothing in the correspon
dence that led to the creation of the
commission nor in the credentials and
instructions delivered to its members
which would preclude consideration
of the many other subjects which the
commission made incidental to those
aereed upon in the proctocol. In ef
fect he suggests that the proctocol be
laid aside for the present and the
work of the commission be directed
along fresh channels.
Although the conditions imposed
for withdrawal of the troops were not
to his liking, he attempted to make
it clear that his chief objection to rat
ifying the document was not based up
on the conditions, but on the fact that
he could not conscientiously sign any
thing which would place him in the
position of having appeared to sanc
tion even for a brier time the pres
ence in Mexico of foreign troops.
