YEAR OF PROMISE FULFILLED PRESAGES ONE OF ACHIEVEMENT
It's No Job for
Any Bonehead
Is a lack of co-operation between the
United States district attorney's office
and that of United States Marshal Boyle
responsible for the fact that Fred and
Ora Billingsley are still at large? They
were indicted along with their brother
Logan by the federal grand jury a whole
week ago.
The fact remains that they have
escaped arrest.
And the truth of the business is that
'hey are badly wanted by District Attor
ney Clay Allen to substantiate Logan's
confession as to how the Billingsley
brothers conducted a wholesale traffic in
liquor with the assistance of some cor
rupt public officials.
It's an open secret that the district at
torney's office feels that the marshal's
office has not given the right support in
the matter of making grrests.
And over at the marshal's office little effort in
made to cover up the fact that the arrest of Fred
and Ora Billingsley would have been easy if As
sistant District Attorney Winter S. Martin hadn't
broken faith with th« marshal by permitting the pre
mature publication of the fact that the Billingsleys
hid been indicted.
In fact, he permitted the whole story to become public
before Marshal Boyle knew that Logan Billingsley had
been arrested in San Francisco.
If the charge that the marshal's office is not doing its
best now to find Fred and Ora is true, it is also true
hat in the beginning, Martin's boneheaded play for pet
-onal publicity caused a lot of trouble that he had no
right to cause.
The public isn't as interested in the blunders that have
u een committed by both those offices, as it is in seeing
them get together and get the Billingsleys without fur
ther delay.
The people of Seattle saw the Billingsley* tie city and
rounty authorities in a knot and make a public spectacle
-f them. They expect their federal servants to make
•> more businesslike showing in their present combat
with the booze kings.
DISTRICT ATTORNEY ALLEN OUGHT TO
MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR MARTIN TO
MAKE FURTHER "ADVERTISING" BLUNDERS.
AND THEN IF HE CAN'T GET ACTION FROM
THE MARSHAL HE OUGHT TO TAKE THE
MATTER TO THE GRAND JURY WHEN IT
RECONVENES.

COMMERCIAL CLUB
AND CHAMBER TO
MERGE MARCH 3
A union of the Chamber of
Commerce and the Commercial
Club, the dream of Seattle for
many years, is today SO per
rent completed The New
Year, 1917, "the year of
achievement." will actually see
the dream fulfilled.
The Commercial Club Friday
night unanimously adopted the
merger plan agreed to by spe
cial committees from each
body, who met jointly with
President Henry Suxzallo of
the University of Washington.
The latter acted in an advisory
capacity.
The report of the Joint commit
tee was read by Worrall Wilson,
end was received with enthusiastic
applause. The Chamber of Com
merce trustees will act on It next
Tuesday. It was signed by all
n.rmbers of both committees, ex
opt former Senator S H Piles of
the Chamber
The latter was called away on
.i business engagement, but bad
said he intended to sign with a

visions.
l'nder the merger plan, the in
debtedness of the Commercial Club
is lo be wiped out. l'nder the
laws, two corporations cannot con

For that reason, the Commercial
