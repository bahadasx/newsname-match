a .week or two and was in a state of

,fray funeral e penses, the 'body be
ing truned over to the Stanga under

It rill be remembered by some
that iLair wasp without support and
an .P9$eal wa# made Ito the Polloe
Jury to help him. He has also been
assisted by others, and had eked out
a precarious living. He had been
