OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
Colville, Stevens County, Washington, Saturday, December 30, 1916
The New Year—
and Retrospection
The year 1916 has beeu a pros
perous one for Colville and for
Stevens county. No sudden ex
pansion has taken place in our
factories, no "war babies" have
made sudden wealth for our citi
zens, and no unexpected increase
in our products has come. But
the steady development of our
lands, mines, timber resources, and
livestock possibilities has given a
firmer basis to the busiuess life of
the county. The feeling of hard
times of a few years ago has grad
ually slipped from our minds iv
the increasing cares of new busi
ness, and at this close of the fourth
year of thu administration of
Woodrow Wilson it seems that
perhaps he might have been right
in his statement that the hard
times are largely of a psychologi
cal nature.
Eastern Washiugtou has profit
ed during the last two years, iv
the increase iv prices of wheat
ami ores. Stevens county has re
ceived but a slight result of this
profit. But when the wheat and
ore prices go back to normal,
this county's developed lands and
its herds of stock and dairy cattle
will not permit any appreciable
notice to be taken of changes, for
our prosperity is built on a more
solid basis.
Merchandising ihas been good
this year. Although the banks
do not carry a much greater vol
ume of money than formerly,
money is now in circulation, with
the resultant profit to the many.
When it was in the bank vault,
no one profited from it. Mer
chants say that the holiday trade
broke all records in Colville, and
other towns report in the same
strain. Prices are higher in most
lines than normally, but at the
same time the producers of the
county are receiving top-notch
prices.
A retrospect of conditions is al
ways easy—just as is the prophecy
of the future. But when we come
to compare past prophecies with
the following performances, we
find that the mind of man is uot
always accurate in prognostica
tion. And as the new year will
be starting next week, with the
future bright, why not consider
this idea of prophecies, and see
if the new year can not also be
made happier by reason of OUT
experiences.
To go back a few yeai?s. Do
you remember when it was pre
dicted that the rapid growth of
the moving picture show was look
ed upon with alarm by the busi
ness men, the theatrical houses,
the actors, the churches, and even
the saloons? Yet we still live.
Do you remember when the parcel
post was likely to break up the
express companies, ruin the coun
try merchant, and throw all busi
ness into the cities? And the pos
tal savings bank was about to
wreck the country's banking sys
tem? And the federal reserve
act would kill our money system ?
Yet during 1916 were you partic
ularly injured by any of these?
And do you remember how the
lowering of the tariff was to
wreck this country's industry,
kill the fanning business, lower
wool and grain and meat prices,
and bring upon us several other
threatened calamities? What
battles we fought over this ques
tion four years ago! And yet
the very opposite was the result.
And do you remember how lo
cal option was predicted—on thr
one hand to lower court costs and
improve business, and on the other
hand to increase drunkenness and
kill business? Neither prediction
came true. And do you remember
how prohibition was threatening
to kill the business in this state,
bring hard times, empty the store
T™^^ **~ * * * . -
There's nothing like starting the
new year right
btjjildiugs, and throw all our
mom \ into other states, leaving
in thi'ir wake multitudes <>L' blind
pigs' Yci today no city or town
in the state says or believes the
predii'tinn was correct.
II all s^-iifs to show (hat we need
nol worry so much about the
brid'jv until we cross it, and that
the crossing will be easy it' we
jussi leud to our own business cor
rectly. The future always has
its own way of taking can' of it
self, and need never lie loaded
down with dire forebodings of
man
B.i for 1917 what is the use of
trying lo predict this or that
thiny which is likely to mar our
pleasure, spoil our business, or
wri■'■!< our country. Based on past
performances, the percentage of
chtmeo is all against the predic
ti<ms coming true. What the re
sult may be after the European
was is over, need nol particularly
bother the stock' men or farmers
or business men of Stevens coun
ty. But the stumps in the field,
the poor blood in the herd, the
wastage of operations on the Farm,
tha ignorance of the business man
as to the details of his business —
these are things which may profit
ably occupy the time of the man
who used to worry.
The year 1!)17 looks good. It
will undoubtedly be good if it
lias any help from our people.
Spokane has been named as the
place for the federal farm loan
lunik for District 12, comprising
Washington, Oregon, .Montana
and Idaho. .This permanently es
tablishes Spokane as the business
center of the northwest. Associa
tions may be organized in any
community for the purpose of se
ducing loans, and their busiiiGHb
will go through the district farm
loan bank. Colville already fcos
such an association.
Stevens county is credited with
Jliaving 563 automobiles, or one
l'ir every 48 people. Since the
eilitor has not had time to get the
r. leases from his 47 other joint
owners, he has had no trouble
with his engine freezing Ihus far
tliis winter.
Subscribers to the Examiner
should note the credit on their
address, as showing when their
subscriptions expire. And in
case of any error, this office
should be notified immediately.
Notice of expiration will appear
on their last issue, and if no re
newal is made the paper is auto
matically stopped without further
notice. Renewals should be
prompt in order not to mias any
issues. All subscriptions ex
pire with the last issue of the
month, and any credit which
reads "Jan 16" means that the
subscription expires Jan. 1, 1917,
and that no more copies will be
sent until « renewal is made.

It may bo that Governor Lister
will not inhabit the statehouso
daring his second term. The
maintenance of this venerable
wreck called the executive man
sion is presumably up to the state.
Governor Lister says if the state
demands that he live there, the
state must keep up the house,
otherwise he will take up some
comfortable private abode for him
self and family and live like a
white man.
The stntc board of finance is
composed of the governor and two
of the republican state officials.
The Intter did not desire to recom
mend sufficient, appropriations to
maintain the house. It "will be re
membered that during the cam
paign much ado was made by the
Lister opponents regarding cer
tain costs in the executive man
sion. The governor now intimates
that he has had enough foolish
ness over this matter, and will
stand it no longer. So it may be
that next summer's visitors to the
capital will find the governor
nicely housed in some respectable
place, instead of holding forth in
tlif executive barn.
The death rate in the United
Slates last year was the lowest of
record —l 3% for each thousand
inhabitants. This is an encourag
ing report, and shows that the
stride of civilization is a healthful
one.
Yet with the above announce
ment comes the report of the in
ternal revenue department show
ing an increase for the same pe
riod in the amount of internal
revenue receipts, and in the quan
tity of liquors sold. With glee
the liquor dealers 1 associations
are attempting to point out the
moral.
It is true that alcohol will pre
serve llesh. Some oil the best
[•reserved (or pickled) specimens
of humanity we have ever seen
were the result of a continued ap
plication of the preservative which
is found alike in liquor, hair oil,
and face varnish. Hut no phy
sician has ever claimed that al
cohol could make good blood any
better, a good stomach any health
ier, or a perfect liver more per
fect. Vet the liquor people are
really truthful in their statements
that the decrease in the death rat«
is not due particularly to any
decrease in the use of liquor.
Ignorance is death. The an
cients preached it. The pulpits
today preach it. Ignorance or
disregard of the laws of heredity
and physiology are stated as be
ing the cause of 35 per cent of all
blindness, 20 per cent of all in
sanity, CO per cent of the crime,
and 7"> per cent of the unhappy
homes. After getting through
with these percentages, it would
seem to make little difference
whether a man used 40-rod or rat
poison to while away his declin
ing years.
After holding his magnesite
property for 90 days, Ray Allen
of lone this week sold it to Chica
go parties at a profit of $40,000
as a cash deal. The property is
located in Stevens county near
Valley and is being worked at
present. Mr. Allen was mayor of
the town in its early days, and
with his family has resided here
at different periods since that time.
Many friends here rejoice in hi s
good fortune.—lone News.
