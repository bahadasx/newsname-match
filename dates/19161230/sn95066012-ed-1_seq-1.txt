icene of War
NOW FIGHTING NEAR VERDUN
Germans Took a Small Section of
Trench and a Few Prisoners But
Were Driven Out.
London, Dec. 30. Pressing in on
southern Moldavia from three sides,
apparently with all their vigor, the
forces of the central powers are mak
ing progress against stiff resistance.
On the Transylvaniau-Moldavian
frontier, in the region north ot Rlm-nik-Sarat
and in the Dobrudja op
posite Braila, Berlin reports, the Aus-tro-German
and Bulgarian troops are
advancing.
A new thrust seemingly lias been
started by the Austro-Germans along
the Moldavian frontier. Several lines
of positions and 1400 prisoners were
taken by the Invaders in the first day
of their offensive into Moldavia from
the west, which may have for its pur
pose the cutting off of the retreat of
the Ru8so-Rumanian troops now oper
ating along the southern Moldavian
border.
Along the river Kasino and west of
Covesha, Petrograd says, Rumanian
troops were driven back nearly a
mile. A desperate battle also is re
ported as taking place near Sesmezo
near Ocna and within the Moldavian
boundry. North of Rimnlk Sarat all
attacks were repulsed according to
Petrograd.
Field Marshal von Mackenseu has
reached Dumitresti, about 12 miles
northwest of Rlmnik-Sarat, and north
east of that town troops under his
comamnd have captured several vil
lages. The number of prisoners tak
en by this army totalsl400, in addition
to cannon and machine guns. -
The Rumanian province o Dobrud
ja 'has now been almost cleared of de
fenders, as Berlin says that Ratehelu,
northeast of the Matchin bridgehead
across the Danube from Braila, has
been conquered. Ratchelu is on the
Danube.
West of the Meuse, in the Verdun
region, the forces of the German
crown prince have repulsed attacks
by French troops against new German
positions on Dead Man hill, where sec
ond and third-line trenches were en
tered by the Germans and 220 prison
ers and seven machine guns were tak
en. Paris admits a slight success for
the Germans in this section, saying
that one trench south of Dead Man
hill was entered by the attackers.
Other efforts to advance between the
Meuse and Avoeourt and In front of
both Dead Man hill and Hill 304 were
repulsed by the French.
Except for some engagements be
tween patrols around Urody in Guil
ds no activity is reported from the
eastern, Macedonian and Austro
Itallan fronts. British and ' French
troops have carried out successful
raids on the west front at various
points.

BOND ISSUE
!0 BEET. DEFICIT
OF MtW YEAR
President Practically Agrees it is
Necessary
FOR ARMY AND NAVY NEEDS
President Wilson Will Send Special
Message to Congree Covering
tne Question.
Washington, Dec. 2!). Tentative
approval has been given by President
Wilson to plans for a bond issue to
meet a part of the prospective deiicit
at the end of the next fiscal year
and the administration leaders in con
gress are preparing to bring in their
revenue bill as soon as possible after
the holiday recess. It became known
today that they have urged that the
president should deliver a special
message or adopt some other means to
spur both houses to prompt action so
that the necessary legislation may bo
passed before the end of the present
session.
It has been agreed that any bond
issue shall be charged to the account
of extraordinary army and navy ex
penditures. Representative Hull of
Tennessee, autiior of the Income Tax
law, outlined today a plan he has
drafted for consideration of the Ways
and Means committee for separating
preparedness accounts from the ordi
nary expenses and receipts of the
government. He estimates that ordi
nary expenses this year and next will
be less than the ordinary receipts.
and that special taxation and bond is
sues will be needed only to cover ex
cess disbursements for various pur
poses, including army, navy, and forti
fications extensions.
Mr. Hull's plan contemplates the
issuance of $125,000,000 of Panama
Canal bonds for army and navy ex
penses.170,000,000 under the Shipping
act and for the proposed nitrate
plant, and $25.00,000 to pay for the
Danish West Indies or a total of $220,-
000.000.

CANADA MAKING MUNITION
Few Orders from Great Britain Com
ing to United States.
New York, Dec. 29. British muni
tion orders amounting to hundreds of
millions of dollars are being placed
with Canadian manufacturers, accord
ing to information obtained in bank
ing quarters yesterday, while few
are coming to the United States. It
was learned that within the last few
days an order for shells larger than
the biggest contract placed in this
country last year had been lodged
with the Montreal Locomotive Com
pany, Ltd., the Canadian branch of
the American Locomotive Company.
As it was believed that the ltUilo
heni Steel Conwration got a shell or
der last ear amounting to $150,000,
000, an estimate on the Canadian or
der was between $175,000,000 and $20,
000,000.
Steel manufacturers have known
for several months that few more or
ders for completed sheels would come
to the United States, but it was not
a matter of general knowledge that
Canada was slated to take up a vast
part of the work. It had been sup
posed that the hundreds of munition
factories which have sprung up in
C.reat Britain. England, and Italy
would take over the task. News that
Canada had developed facilities to
handle a shell business which may
amount to fully $400,000,00" next
year, if the war continues, was sur
prising to many persons of the finan
cial district, who recalled that last
year parts of a number of Canadian
orders were sublet in this country.
Several important influences have
caused the allied munition buyers to
switch shellmaklng to Canada. In the
first place, of course, there Is a de
sire to utilize the facilities of a
country having a direct part in the
war, whose plants and workmen will
profit from the business. Another
consideration is the sconomy to be ef
fected in having the finished goods
turned out close to the base of sup
plies of raw material. Whether the
allied war material is made in Canada
or in Europe, a great part of the steel
rounds and brass plate used will have
to come from this country As the
completed shells can be shipped
across the Atlantic cheaper than
steel, copper, and zinc in the rough,
it would be in keeping w ith the econ
omic plans of the fighting nations to
have munitions made up on this side
of the water.
Besides supplying much of the ma
terials to be used in the Canadian
shell factories, bankers expect that
the financing of the purchases will be
done in New York. The $75,000,000
loan floated here by the Dominion ear
ly this year was a pronounced suc
cess, and bankers feel that requests
for additional accommodation would
receive immediate attention in this
country. The assumption of more of
the war expenses by the Canadian
Government would relieve the British
Treasury of a heavy load and make
stionger the credit of the home Gov
ernment in the markets of the -world.
In banking circles it was said yes
terday that no overtures had been
made for a Canadian loan in any form
and further financing by tho Entente
Powers Is expected to hold over until
some time after Jan. 1.

BENEFIT FOR SUFFERERS
"Jaffery" to be Shown at Opera House
Sunday for War Stricken People
A picturization ot W. J. Locke's
famous novel, "Jaffery," will be giv
en at the opera house Sunday, De
cember 31st, for the benefit of the
starving Jews and Albanians suffer
ing from the effects of the great war.
This picture, which is the first of the
Golden Eagle features of the Inter
national film service, inc., is a photo
play that appeals to red-blooded men,
to romance loving women and to
healthy children. Ada Patterson, in
the New York American, has this to
say of it:
"Thrilled, charmed, entertained as
I have not been for many a moon of
plays, I have just come from the New
York Theatre, -where 1 saw 'Jaffery.'
"1 never missed a word of 'Jaffery.'
Cross my heart, I didn't. And I am
among those who sign deeply and
look ecstatic whenever the name of
W. J. Locke is read or spoken.
"For ninety minutes 'Jaffery'
sweeps one along on the surge of its
emotional events. It holds an aud
ience suspended by the thread of
sentiment. It affords that escape
from self, that every-one seeks, and
everyone needs at times. You can no
more think of today's housekeeping,
or tomorrow's business than you
could plan a picnic during a storm at
sea.
"If you aro an appreciator of the
whimsy and delight in the Locke
stories, see 'Jaffery.' If you never
read Locke, but like u breathless,
rushing, nerve-exhilarating motion
screen play, see 'Jaffery. In either
case, you will be a happy playgoer.
For it is a good fortune to see 'Jaf
fery.' "

"It Is with the most lively interest
that the Norwegian government has

made with the purpose of facilitating
measures looking toward the estab

the same time seeking to avoid any

"The Norwegian government
would consider itself failing in its dut

all humanity if it did not express its
deepest sympathy will all efforts
which could contribute to put an end

tho moral aud material losses. It has
every hope that the initiative of Presl

worthy of the high purpose which in
