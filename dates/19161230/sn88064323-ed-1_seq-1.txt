A MASONIC FEAST
CELEBRATING
"ST. JOHNS."
A Joint Installation of the Officers Elect of Wistaria
Chapter No. 61, O. E. S. and Aurora Lodge,
No. 193, F. & A. M.
December 27tli, St. John's Day,
191G, was celebrated by the mem
bers of the Order of the Eastern
Star in conjunction with the mem
herb of the Masonic fraternity in a
most appropriate and memorable
manner. It was truly a holiday
occasion and even I lie elements
were most favorable to cneourag
iug a large attendance. Both or
ders were welLrepresented in the
gathering of ladies and gentlemen
and every countenance rellected a
sharp Interest in every feature of
the evening's progiam. Dr. E. S.
Fulton, the Worshipful Master of
the Masonic Lodge here, called
the assemblage to older and brielly
explained the objects of the gath
ering. He theu introduced Mr.
Jessie Allen Taylor, the Grand
Lecturer for the State of Louisi
ana, representing the Masonic
Grand Lodge, lie was greeted by
the Masonic Grand Honors.
Mr. Taylor is no stranger to the
older members of Aurora Lodge.
In HM)S he was a resident of this
city, in the employ of Morgan's
La. & Tex. railroad, and on July
Oth of that year ho received the
Master Mason's degree in Aurora
Lodge. Some two years later it
became necessary for him to re
move with his family to a new
home in Kayue, where he has re
sided siuce. His Masonic career,
begun with us in New Iberia, went
forward aud upward in his new
walks of life, lie affiliated with
the lodge at Kayne and took an
active and tireless interest in the
work. In the course of time he
beoume the Worshipful -Master of
his lodge and a delegate to the
Graud Lodge of Louisiana, and at
the 1910 session of the Graud
Lodge he was honored by being
made the Graud Lecturer for the
Slate of Louisiana, a position he
has tilled with marked ability and
distinction.
Mr. Taylor's address on this oc
casiou was a masterful effort, re
plete with glimpses of Masonic
history, Masonic philosophy and
Masonic admonition. He review
ed briefly how this most wonder
tul secret order, without prosely
ting, without canvasser or solicit
or, had quietly and unostentatious
ly grown in numerical strength till
its adherents in the United States
numbered close to two million
members. It was admitted that
MaHoury could not undertake to
make a good man out of every bad
man, but it was contended that no
good man had ever gone astray
following the teachings of the or
der. It had broadened the pur
poses of thousands of its votaries
aud made better men of them, bet
ter citizens, better husbands aud
better fathers, filling their lives
with earnestness, a love of truth,
sincerity and earnestness in all
undertakings.
The speaker indulged in a brief
review of the antiquity of the or
der, declaring that its origin reach
ed back into the mists of the past
beyond the compass of recorded
history. Its universality had ever
kept pace with the advance of
civilization In all countries of this
globe. All nations aud all creeds
harbored the Mason and his teach
ings, exemplifying the universal
brotherhood of man aud the bene
ticent fatherhood of Deity.
Dr. E. S. Fulton, the Worship
ful Master elect for the third sue
cessive term, followed in a splen
did address replete with thoughts
befitting the occasion.
Tlje installation of the officers
elect of Wistaria Chapter No. 01,
O. K. S., followed, Grand Lecturer
Taylor officiating as installing offl
cer and a Past Worthy Patron of
the Order. Past Worthy Matron
Mrs. E. JF. Millard served as Mar
shal. Officers were installed as
follows:—
O. E. S.
Mrs. Theda B. Murray, W. M;
Edwd. W. Lee, W. P;

Mrs. P. F. Henry, Adah;
Mrs. Rand, Rath;
Miss Elsie Monk, Esther;
Miss B. Baumann, Martha;
Miss Laura Hatch, Electa;
Jno, C. Rober», Sentinel.
The O. E. S. officers having % been
proclaimed, by the Marshal, as duly
aud constitutionally installed for the
ensuing year, the scenes were prompt
ly shifted for the installing of Masonic
officers elect. Dr. H. A. King acted as
the Grand Marshal and Mr. Taylor,
Deputy G. M , acted as installing offi
cer:
Dr. E. S. Fulton, Worrfhipful Master
Victor J. Eratb, Senior Warden.
Edward W. Lee. Junior Warden.
Jno. T. White, Secretary.
Scranton Rand, Treasurer.
D. C. Bonnet, Senior Beacon.
Dr. F. F. Courts, Junior Deacon.
J. A. Fagot, Chaplain.
fill. Winters,Master of Ceremonies.
I. I). Rednion, Tyler.
The installation ceremonies were
concluded by the proclamation of the
acting Grand Marshal that the officers
of Aurora Lodge, No. BW, F. &: A. M.,
had been duly aud constitutionally in
stalled for the ensuing year.
Both lodges then repaired to the
banquet hall, where a most sumptuous
feast had been prepared to be served
bv the members of Wistaria Chapter.
The large hall had the tables set
crosswise, and these several tables
fairly groaned under the weight of
roast turkey, chicken salads and inn
merable condiments, cakes, delicacies
aud cafe noir.
The banquet ended the bidding
adieu to the guests followed.
LAUDIBLE MUNIFICENCE
Successful men have ever chosen
their own peculiar methods of em
ploying the fruits of t heir labor,
brain work, or investments. Ac
cumulated wealth has frequently
been employed in extending the
enterprise which has made the ac
cumulation possible. It is uot
often, however, that the success
ful one casts about him seeking
such employment, even of a very
small part, of the fruits of his
success as will give pleasure to a
great number aud accomplish
much good. When such munifi
ceuce is met with, it is worthy of
more than the casual "thank you."
On last Wednesday evening Mr.
Chas. bmedes. of Cade Station, at
tended the banquet and installa
tion ceremonies of the Masonic
Temple in this city. As he finish
ed the long climb of the stairs to
the third floor—the Lodge room
aud the banquet hall—he asked of
his chanced near neighbor; "What
has the committee on elevator for
this building done?" After learn
ing the status of affairs at the
time he supplemented his inquiry
by the statement and proposition
—"If the committee will get busy
and plau to put in an elevator at
once, I will pay one half of its
cost. I am tired of climbing
these stairs—It is becoming an ef
fort for me to do so."
A few minutes later Mr. Smedes
looked up Mr. A. B. Murray and
turned over to him an envelope
containing some papers. Upon
investigation it was found that
the envelope covered the cancell
ed evidences of the church debt of
the Episcopal Church of this city.
Mr. Murray is the senior deacon
of the vestry and when he receiv
ed the papers Mr. Sinedes advised:
"In the name and memory of my
brother." The load thus lifted
from the shoulders of the congre
gation of the Episcopal Church of
the Epiphany amounted to about
one thousand dollars.
In conversation with others he
expressed the view that "a church
should be free of debt," and stated
that he had done the same for the
Methodist church at St. Martin
ville. He then councilled, "Keep
your church out of debt. If you
find that you can't do this, see me
first." .
It is perhaps needless to add
that the wave of rejoiciog rolled
away in every direction with Mr.
Sinedes as its center. Aboht the
conclusion of the ceremonies in
the banquet hall he expressed his
admiration of the mauuer in which
the ladies of the O. E. S. had ban
died this affair, but thought the
"crowd was a little large to pro
mote the best interests of sociahi
lity." However, he thoroughly
approved of it and announced to
Mrs, A. B. Murray, the Worthy
Matron, that be was goiug to send
her a check for fifty dollars for the
Chapter, expressing the hope that
it would help in the getting up of
another similar affair at no very
distant date in the future.
Mr. Smedes left that night for
the city of New Orleans to attend
matters of business and also to
take part in the investigation of
sugar prices.

FRENZIED EFFICIENCY.
As the war goes on us u. oi
teucies pile up. We, as Ameri
cans, are informed tiiat we ai<
meddling and interfering even to
suggest a suspension o! the hiiio
ous slaughter and waste. Vet in
the name of humanity Ambassa
dor Gerard addresses the chair
man of the American Relief (Join
in it tee:
"There is a real need in < Germany
for the relief work. There are
probably over a million widows
and orphans who have been left
practically penniless by rea ci o''
the death of their protectors at
the front. True enough, the Gov
eminent awards a small pension
to these widows, but it is not
neaily enough to keep the wolf
from the door. We are endeavor
ing to feed these destitute people
through the medium of re'ief
kitchens in Bei lin and other Ger
man towns. Every cent coutrib
uted will t>e used for the pur
pose."
Then there is the relief work in
Belgium, Poland, Serbi i, and
there will soon be appeals from
Rumania. We have our own ex
cjssive cost of living to confront
us. Our Government has let con
tracts for $(10,000,000 worth of
new warships, aud that is just the
beginning.
It is wrong of us to meddle to
stop this war, and it is wrong Of
us to profit by its continuance.
The strife will go through to at
least the end of the third year,
whether we like it or not. By the
end of the third year the cost ot
the war will reach eighty billion
dollars—twice the value of all the
farms and their appurtenances
aud their products in the United
States.
The man cost at the end of the
third year, in dead and permanent
ly disabled, will reach 12,000,001)
"souls," as the Russians express
it. Think of wiping out the en
tire male population w'est of the
Rookies aud you begin to realize
what the loss of 12,000,000 effect
ive means.
But the war irniRt go on. A
new War Emperor of Austria is
euthroued with blazing and costly
pomp; the Greek king is about to
bo dethroned; the Sultan of Tur
key is little uiore than a messen
gor boy for the Kaiser; hosts of
Belgians are being deported into
slavery; Zeppelins keep on rain
women aud
arc being
ing down bombs on
children and in turn
shot down and their crews slaugh
tered. There is misery aud star
vation in South America. Even
the Patagonians suffer. (July the
Eskimos appear to be unscatched.
And amid all this chaos you
hear resounding praise of won
drous organization and efficiency,
of marvels of science aud prodi
gies of valor. But to some of us
it is beginning to take on tlm as
pect of maniacal efficiency aud
frenzied organization. It impels
us to yearn for the bungling sim
plicities of life, for the inefficiency
of Christ's benign precepts. We
have had it drummed at us that
the Goldeu ltulc is impractical,
that even fair play is idiotic,
whether in modern business, diplo
rnacy, statecraft or government.
If that be so, let us ask, as the
dawn of the New Year approaches,
that the Creator bestow his bless
ings upon some of the impractical
ities aud simplicities that are left
to us, aud let us pray for a very
great reaction toward humility
aud brotherly love.—Country Gen
tleman.
