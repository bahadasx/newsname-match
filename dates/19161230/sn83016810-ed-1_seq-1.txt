ABOUT HOGM/WAY.
Disputed Origin of Name'of Old Time
New Year's
It is possible that "mumming," such
as marks New Year's day in Philadel
phia and some other places, is related
in some way to the performance which
marked "Hogmanay" in England, and
Scotland. Hogmanay was the last
day of the year, says the New York
Times. Some scholars think the word
comes from the Greek "agia mene"
("holy month"), others from the Saxon
"halig monath," which has the. same
meaning still ethers from the- French
phrase "An qui menez!" ("To the "mis
tletoe go!") whicji mummers anciently
cried in France at Christmas or .from
"An queux menez!" {"Bring to the beg-
gars!"). Whatever the original of the
word may be, Hogmanay was the time
for much amateur begging*
The children went from house ^.to
house singing such songs as
J- Hogmanay, Irollolay. i*^
Give us of your white breao.
But none' of your gray.

they called m*ir "farh^"oaten cake
