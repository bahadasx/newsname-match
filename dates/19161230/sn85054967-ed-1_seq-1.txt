GERMANY WILLING TO
TELL TERMS TO WILSON
\
Ready to Enter Into Secret Negotiations
Rather Than to See Peace F ail.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.
Continued agitation by Germany
for peace in the face of the ap
parently immovable opposition
of the entente powers was to
night accepted in Washington
as the most encouraging devel
opment in the peace situation.
Count von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador, tonight re
iterated his declaration that
Germany is earnest and sincere
in her desire to end the war. Di
plomatic Washington accepted
this statement as indicating that
the central powers may be will
ing to go further in indicating
their definite peace aims than
they have heretofore.
The German embassy made it
clear that a statement of the
terms proposed by the central
allies —in more or less definite
form—is now available to the
United States, under seal of sec
recy.
Secretary Lansing declared
that all questions as to this "con
fidential" matter were clearly
improper and declined to discuss
it. It was apparent, however,"
that Germany had submitted to
this country her informal plans
for allowing the United States to
handle her peace terms until a
similar declaration can be secur
ed from the entente allies. Ad
vices to Washington from Am
erican diplomats abroad, and
through belligerent representa
tives here, were to the effect
that while the entente powers
are still jointly preparing a reply
to the German peace advances,
they will steadfastly maintain
their refusal to discuss peace un
til Germany has made her peace
terms clear and has stated them
in the open.
CHILD DIES FOLLOWING
MOST HAPPY CHRISTMAS
After partially recovering
from an attack of infantile par
alysis, Mary Doubt, aged five
years, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Ralph Doubt, of Sides Station,
died in the Indiana Hospital, on
Tuesday night from Bright's di
sease. The child was one of the
early victims of the disease in
this county, and following the
lifting of the quarantine from
her parents' home she was tak
en to the Indiana Hospital where
she responded to treatment ra
pidly for a time and had regain
ed partial use of the paralyzed
limbs. Bright's disease develop
ed recently, however, and she be
gan to fail. The child was a fa

were made to make Christmas
enjoyable for her. She took part
THE PA TRIOT
Formal Replies Received.
The formal copies of the Ger
man and Austrian replies to the
President's peace note were re
ceived at the state department
today without comment. Both
were laid before the President,
who likewise refused to discuss
them. The official text of the
notes differed but little and only
in insignificant details from the
| published versions.
The state department and the
White House took the attitude
tonight that there was nothing
for the United States to do to
; ward peace until the formal re
ply of the entente powers to the
President's note has been receiv
ed. Neutral diplomats, however,
declared that the general policy
of neutral indorsment of the
President's proposals would be
continued and that specific in
dorsements might be officially
received from the Scandinavian
nations. Holland and the South
American countries at any time.
Senor Calerdon, the Bolivian
minister and dean of the Latin-
American diplomatic corps, said
that joint action by the South
American nations was to be ex
pected promptly. A change of
ministry in Bolivia has delayed
matters slightly and Minister
Calderon today cabled the new
premier, Senor Sanchez, for in
structions. Central American
countries are expected to follow
closely the action of the South
American nations.
The German embassy tonight
was emphatic in its declaration
that the peace advances of the
central powers were bona fide,
and in denying published reports
that the peace proposals were
designed to forestall a serious
break with the United States
over the question of submarine
warfare.

AIRSHIP THROWS SEARCHLIGHT
AND ILLUMINATES CREEKSIDE
1
Residents of Creekside were startled Tuesday morning about
5 o'clock when they were suddenly awakened by the noise of a
powerful engine which seemed to come from the sky. Rushing to
their doors they saw a streak of light in the sky, a searchlight
which intermittently flashed its rays down into the streets of the
awakening burg. Behind the rays of light, the outlines of an
airship were distinctly seen, the network upheld by a huge gas
bag.
Perhaps some of them thought that one of the belligerent na
tions' representatives was about to invade the little town. Ac
cording to some who actually saw the night prowler, it was soar
ing at a height of about 300 feet and was headed in the direction
of Indiana.
The identity of the tsrange craft is yet unsolved, and much
mystery surrounds the strange event. The spectacle was most
sensational, the searchlights illuminating the sky in monstrous
arcs for a great distance.

It was a joyous Christmas for
Homer McManis, aged 28, of
Marion Center. He met his fath
er, Simon Blystone, of Whites
burg, Armstrong county, after a
separation of a quarter of a cen
tury, during which time neither
father nor son knew the where

ilia inother leaving her husband,
Simon Blystone and his children.
Relatives took two of the boys

effort to keep the youngest child
with him. The care of the three
year old lad was too much for
the man, and he was placed un
der the care of the poor over

Manis adopted the boy and lo

ULTIMATUM BY RAILWAY
EMPLOYES TO ROADS
"Put Adamson Law Into Effect January I
Or We Will Not Answer Consequences"
NEW YORK, Dec. 28.—"Put
the Adamson eight-hour law in
to effect January I—or we will
not be responsible for what hap
pens.
This was the ultimatum deliv
ered today by the brother-hood
chiefs to the railway managers
at an executive conference in the
Grand Central terminal.
A flat rejection of the demand
was made, and the brotherhood
heads, W. G. Lee, of the train
men, Warren Stone, of the engi
neers, W. S. Carter, of the fire
men and Acting Chief L. E.
Shepherd, of the conductors, ab
ruptly quitted the conference.
Elisha Lee, chairman of the
national conference committee
of the railways, gave out a state
ment tonight in which he ex
pressed the determination of the
railroads to tawait the decision
of the United States supreme
court in the Adamson law test
case. If the law is upheld the
railways will give the men back
pay from Januarv 1, Mr. Lee ad
ded.
The brotherhood chiefs were
positive in their declaration- that
this would not be satisfactory to
the 350,000 railroad employes,
represented by them.
Men Will Not Wait.
"No matter what we might
think individually of your pro
posal," the managers were told,
"we cannot hold back the men
from striking if necessary to
win their rights. The men know
that unprecedented prosperity
has come to the railroads. They
know that bonuses are being giv
en to workers in other industries
in every part of the country.
"They feel that the President
and Congress gave them the Ad
amson law and intended it to go

intend to secure their rights un
der the Adamson law beginning
January 1. "
One of the railroad represent
tatives after the meeting said:
"I consider the situation more
critical than it has been since the
stirring days of last September.
I should not be surprised if spor
adic strikes should break out
next week. Some men may get
away from the leaders, but I
don't expect a general strike.
"The brotherhood leaders
know that if they countenance a
general strike before the su
preme court decides the Adam
son test case, Congress would
pass the compulsory investiga
tion act over night. The su
preme court's decision may be
expected about February 1. That
means tftat one month's overpay
—or about $5,000,000 —will be
held in abeyance for the men.
This sum will be paid, promptly,,
providing the constitutionality
of the Adamson law is upheld.
"Tf the supreme court's decis
ion is against us, another meet
ing with the representatives of
our employes will be held to in
terpret the law. For instance,,
the law distinctly states that all
! railway employes shall work 8
hours a day. We have no doubt
but what men in the passenger
service are included, men who
under present schedules work as
a rule only five or six hours out.

Another bit of secret history
of the negotiations between the
brotherhoods and President Wil

came known that the President

preme court throws out the Ad

"We refuse to be guests at a
