Washington.-Salary or wage ia
t esses of trom 5 to 10 per cent for
about 16,000 government employes re- I
al ealving less than $1,800 a year and of I
ig $500 a year for each representative's t
eeretary were provided for in the
Slegislative, executive and Judicial ap
propriation bill passed by the House
without a record vote. The secre
a taries now get $1,500 a year. An at- t
t tempt to provide each representative
with an extra stenographer at $75 a
month during the session failed.
lg Discussion or the measure, which
a, carries appropriations aggregating
ie about $39,000,000, was productive of
Id much debate over the financial condi
a- tion of the country. Chairman Fits
a- gerald of the appropriations commit
11 tee and Representative Rainey of the
ways and means committee protested
i against the proposed increase on the t
ic ground that the government already
y faced a huge deficit. Representative i
s- Rainey declared the next budget would
'e exceed $1,600,000,000, and that the c
country was confronted with the pos
sibility of attempting to collect $500,
000,000 more in new taxes. r
ft "How are you going to raise it'" he F
7 asked. "Restore the Payne-Aldricn d
h bill? That is the proposal some of d
5, you make, yet to save your lives you f,
n cannot frame a tariff bill which will a
il yield over $350,000 a year." 1I
Mr. Rainey also asserted that the P
limit in revenue had been reached
from income taxes, the present rate a
} being the highest in the world and 1
h that nation-wide prohibition soon E
would make it necessary to raise $257,- e
0f0,00,000 from some new source. a
P Republican Leader Mann favored
0 higher salaries for employee, declar
ing they should share in the general
prosperity which the country is ex
periencing as a result of the European
war. The bill carried appropriations
for all of the nine subtreasuries in the Il
country. Representative Sisson of
Mississippi made an unsuccessful fight
to have them abolished on the ground
that the federal reserve banks had
made them useless. Secretary Mc
Adoo advised Congress in a letter that
subtreasuries were needed, although
further experience might demonstrate
that the functions of some of them
might be transferred to Washington.
Spirit Dealers Object.
t Paris.-The government's intention tl
to prohibit the consumption of alcohol i
in France has aroused strong opposi- tl
tion among the large wine and spirit rI
dealers. The syndicate of the whole- it
sale mereh'nt, at Bordeaux is send- tl
ing a depuwation to Paris to remon
strate with Premier Briand. As in the p
I case of the absinthe prohibited in 1915 si
i demands are to be made for indemni- t(
ties if the new measure goes into ef- Ia'

"STATE YOUR TERMS,"
ANSWER TO KAISER
GUARANTEES FOR PEACE OF EU.
ROPE NEEDED, SAYS PREMIER
-REPARATION PARAMOUNT.
London.-"Tell us your terms!
"Give us guarantees for the peace of
Europe from the swashbuckling of
Prussian militarism-guarantees surer
than those you have broken!
"Then, and not until then, will the
allies treat with you with regard to
ending the war!"
Reduced to its sum and substance,
that is the answer of Great Britain and
her allies to the central powers' pro
posal to enter into negotiations for
peace. It was given by Lloyd-George
in the House of Commons.
As for the allies' terms-the only
terms on which they will give peace
negotiations a thought-the premier
set them down thus:
"Without reparation peace is impos
sible. The allies insist that the only
end of the war must be complete guar
antee against Prussian militarism dis
turbing the peace of Europe."
And with a ringing note of bitter
irony he added:
"All the outrages on land and sea
cannot be liquidated by a few pious
phrases about humanity."
At the pinnacle of his political ca
reer. in his debut before the House of
Parliament as premier and virtual war
dictator of Great Britain. Lloyd-George
delivered his long-expected address be
fore a house thronged to its capacity
and amid deep, almost reverential st
lence. which was, however, broken re
peatedly by thunderous cheering.
The substance of his declaration, he
announced, would be sent to Germany
within a few days. It was not only
England's answer, the prime minister
emphasized. It was England's "clean
and definite" support to the identical
statements already given by Russia
and France.
It was not a fiat-footed, defiant re
Jection of peace, this remarkable
speech by England's "strongest man,"
which the world had waited breath
lessly for eight anxious days.
It was an unqualified, scornful, al
most contemptuous rejection of the
central powers' proffer as it now
stands. For this proffer, in its present
shape, is a "nose, with the rope's end
in Germany's hands"-thus Lloyd
George described it-and the allies "do
not propose to put their heads into it."
Newspaper presses were still rolling
off extra editions containing the pre
mier's speech-a new edition for each
succeeding paragraph-when the
cables brought from Paris the news
that Aristide Briand. the French pre
rmier, had announced in the Senate
that the entente would send a joint
reply to the central powers, making
it known that "it is Impossible to take
their request for peace seriously."
Earlier the word had come from
Petrograd that the council of the Rus
sian Empire had decided unanimously
to favor a categorial refusal of the
allies to enter peace negotiations with
Germany. e
