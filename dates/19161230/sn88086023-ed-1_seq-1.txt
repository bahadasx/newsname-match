UKIAH, Ore., Dec. 30. Lost in a

searching party headed by her eon,
was the harrowing experience a few
days ago of Mrs. Jackson, who Uvea
six miles from Long Creek.
She had started late in the evening
to go to a neighboring place and had
gone but a little way when the bill
iard swept down upon her. In the
blinding storm she lost her way and
soon had no sense of direction at all.
To save herself she kept her back to
the storm and drifted with It
When she had not returned at the
expected hour her son set out for tho
neighbors and found that she had
never arrived there. He at once sum.
moned help and began a search. Not
having found her at 11 o'cock he sent
to Long Creek for reinforcements and
a large number of men responded.
The search was kept up all night and
the next morning she was found
struggling along through the snow
five miles from where she had started
and In the opposite direction from the
house for which she had headed.
The night was bitterly cold and It Is
regarded as miraculous that she did
not perish. Though an elderly wom

lice in Arresting Siwuiards Lou
Kinqiected of Olme.
Alfredo Medina and Baltezore Es
trada, Spanish bit and spur makers
and also, according to the police, al
cohol and water mixers, were yester
day afternoon trapped by the police
by the une of a marked five dollar
bill and their arrest followed. The
former pleaded guilty to bootlegging
and tried to take all the blame but his
partner was convicted before Judge
Fits Gerald during the afternoon.
Each was fined (100 and, until thay
raise the money, are guests of chief
Gurdane.
The two men have long been sua.
pected by the police but frustrated all
plans to detect them until yesterday.
The crippled Indian, who had been ar
rested for being drunk, was the agen
cy through which they were trapped.
After he had furnished the police
with the Information concerning his
source of supply, he was given a
marked five dollar note with which to
make another purchase. He secured
the liquor, the arre.-ts were made
nnd the marked bill found on Medina.
One bottle of the liiiuor secured
was sealed but It was plainly evident
that the seal had been tampered with
It had obviously been removed and
pasted back on. This constitutes a vi
olation of a federal law and It is
probable the government will press ;
the charge. A. Ottedul, special fed-
eral officer, assisted the police in !
making the arrests. j
Medina freely admitted his guilt j
and discussed the mode of operation
with them. They shipped in pure al- I
eohol and, by the use of coloring mat- j
ter and water, were able to make
from one quart of alcohol four quart i
of a mixture that sold readily for j
whisky at 14 a pint.

THREE OFFICIALS
TURN OVER THEIR
T
County Clerk Saling, Treasurer
Bradley and Attorney Steiwer
Give Way to Successors.
NEW REGIME BEGINS TUESDAY
Treasurer Hint Woman to Take Of
fice In Pendk-ton; B, IC Anderson,
New County ConiniiHsioner Will Al
so Take Ilia Seat.
' Though the newly elected officers
cunnot begin their official duties un
til next Tuesday, Sunday and Monday
being holidays, today Is probably the
last day in office of three well known
Cinatllla county officials. It con
cludes the terms of Clerk Frank Sal
ing, Treasurer G. W. Bradley and Dis
trict Attorney Frederick Steiwer.
All three of these officials have put
their offices In shape so that their
successors may begin their duties
Tuesday morning. County Clerk Bal
ing, who is concluding 12 years of
service, will be succeeded by R. T.
Brown, formerly his deputy. It is
gtnerally believed that the new clerk
will appoint E. O. Draper as his de
puty and Misa Irene Sullivan, at
present stenographer for Mr. Steiwer,
as clerk's stenographer.
When Treasurer Bradley turns over
the county's finances to Miss Grace
Gilliam, his successor, he will have
completed 104 years In that office.
The new treasurer will be the first
woman to tak office here since her
sex was enfranchised. She will prob
ably have no deputy as one of her
campaign promises was to conduct f
the office without assistance.
District Attorney Steiwer is com
pleting his four-year term as prose
cutor though he has been connected
with the office longer, having served
as deputy under G. W. Phelps. He
will be succeeded by R. I. Keator, the
present deputy. Mr. Keator has not
yet decided whether he will appoint a
deputy. His term will be inaugurated
Tuesday in a businesslike way, inas
much as the grand Jury is called to
meet on that day.
The retiring county clerk has a
stock ranch near Stanfield and will
devote much of his time to it in the
future. Mr. Bradley has not yet for
mulated plans for his future activi
ties. Mr. Steiwer retired from the
district attorneyship to devote his
time to his practice. However, he was
elected state senator at the recent el
ection and will leave soon for Salem
to attend the legislature.
The first of the year will also sent
R. E. Anderson, the new county com
missioner, nnd the county court will
thus be restored to its three-man
status.

NOTE WILL BE ISSUED FROM
PAIUS, Doe. SO. The allies'
rcJy will be delivered to neutral
dllomats this afternoon. It re
sents the German attempt to
tlirow the responsibility of the
war on them and refutes the cen
tral powers' claiin of victory. It
says for thirty months the enten
to has sustained a war which It
tried Its utmost to prevent, and
showed by Its acts the attach
ment for peace. The attachment
is jost as strong today as In 1914.
(ED L. KEEN.)
LONDON, Dec. 3. Not only will
the allies answer Germany's peace
proposals and clearly set forth the
principles for which the ententes are
fighting but it will contain an outline
of the terms on which England and
her allies are willing to negotiate it is
confidentially expected.
The fact that the note would list
the terms Is expected as a result of
the awakening of the last few days in
England to the fact that the German
propaganda to neutral nations must be
effectively answered.
Press and public are united In the
belief that the best answer will be a
comprehensive reaffirmation of the
allies' aims and a statement of what
they regard as necesfary peace cond
Hons.
THREATENED BREAK WITH U. S.
MAY FORCE
A BETTER BASIS FOR PEACE
WASHINGTON, Dec. SO. The idea
of a break with Germany over subma
rining will, according to administra
tion officials, constitute a strong
club in forcing Germany to present a
better working basis for peace than
yet given.
The thought that a break might oc.
cur In event of peace failure, is spur

cabinet members, while the endorse
ment of his views by neutrals is mak
ing him doubly anxious to keep up
the work.

Europe's interest is centered on
Paris where the note will be issued.
The note la completed. The Russians'
draft will probably reach Paris to
day with those of the other entente
It is thought It will be made public
before Wednesday.
That Germany sent out feelers be
cause she realized the Somme offen
sive incated future defeat is suggested.
"The moral is the battle was scarce
ended before Germany asked peace."
Quoting Haig, ths Post says: "In
these simple words which resounded
od on German ears like thunder lies
the explanation. All the allies need
to consider Is whether or not German
will concede the objects the allies are
fighting for or prefer to resist until
their resistance is broken. Any sug
gestion on the part of neutrals that a
compromise might be effected is an
attempt to spare Germany and as such
is a violatin of neutrality."
LONDON. Dec. SO. According to
the Central News dispatch from Mad
rid, Spain has notified the United
States she cannot support Wilson''

WASHINGTON. Dec. SO. The
Danish note supporting Wilson's nota
similar to to the Norwegian message

GERMANY INTO
vigorously to Germany against sub
marining is regarded as Inspired by
the knowledge of this government's
purpose should all hopes evaporate.
Spain's action is held to have been
taken to impress Germany that other
neutrals are behind Wilson's moves.
A leading official outlined the sit
uation as having simmered down to a
point where negotiations must contin
ue or the United States will be forced,
if it remains consistent in its policy
toward Germany to break with the
Teutons. This might result in war.
The one instrument left Wilson is to
