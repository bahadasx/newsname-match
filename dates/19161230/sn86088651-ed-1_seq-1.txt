MILITARY TACTICS
Changes to Meet Requirements of
New Army Bill in Regard to
Land Grant Colleges.
Changes In the schedule of drills
and classes In' military science and
tactics to meet the provisions of the
recent army bill with reference to the
land grant colleges and establishment
of the reserve officers' training corps
will be made by A. and M. College at
the beginning of the second college
term, February 3rd.
An increased amount of work will
be required of Juniors and seniors en
rolling in the R. O. T. C, while the
schedule of drills and classes for
those Juniors and seniors not enroll-,
Ing for that work will be reduced. So
well fashioned has the A. and M. Col
lege course been, however, that 'no
extremely . radical changes will be
necessary, as has been the caae In
most of the other land grant colleges.
Heretofore one hour drill has been
required on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday afternoons of all cadets. Un
der the changes which were approved
by the general faculty of the college
Saturday, however, drills fqr the next
term for all students will be reduced
to one hour on two afternoons, the
days to be selected by the schedule
committee. One hour of theoretical
Instruction In military science and
tactlca will be required of all fresh
men and sophomores. Juniors and
seniors enrolling In the reserve offi
cers' training corps will have three
hours theory each week for both
years. Students not enrolling In this
work will be exempt from the class
room work In both Junior and senior
years. Senior privates will to ex
empt from all military duties, but will
be required to participate In the mili
tary system Just so far aa the admin
istration of discipline may require, as
upper classmen are In charge of that
work.
All freshmen and sophomore stu
dents of the college will be uniformed
free by the Tnlted 8tates government
beginning at the opening of the 1917
13 term next September. Juniors and
seniors enrolling In the training corps
will be uniformed and will receive a
monthly ration allowance of 19. There
were no uniforms provided by the
government this year In view of the
heavy demands made by the mobilisa
tion oi me miuua. congress Is ex
pected to reimburse Juniors and sen
lors enrolling In the Tt. O. T. C. for
ration allowance for the present year.
The details of the rearrangement of
the schedule will be left to the com
mlttee having that work In charge.
