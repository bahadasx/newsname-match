16 GIRLS TESTIFY AGAINST ORPET
MARIIAffS CHUMS DEIW THAT SHE WAS MOROSE
SMILING
ONE WAS
MISSING
By Charles E. Russell

ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 17.—A
democratic national convention
 Isn't like a repobllCM national
convention. anyway, but the
thing 1 missed most hore is My
I.olig-l.ost Brother.
There he stood at the door of
every candidate's headquarters,
always a young man with large,
warm manners and a pleasant
_, specialty In smiling.
He bad I .^mtle that started
with bis front teeth and never
stopped until il seemed to fall
into tlie underbrush back of his
ears, and the curious fact Is that
ie never changed.
Also, he had large, moist
palms Ilia) he used without
discretion, and he fell upon
you with un enthusiasm that
suggested childhood's happy
days.
He didn't merely bid you
welcome to the boom fac
tory of his chief; with main
strength, like a Division st.
pnlli i -in. he dragged you in
to the presence!
I bad never seen this done be
fore at any national convention,
and it gave me great delight. Any
innovation of any national con
vention will always have that
effect upon you after you have
attended six or eight of them.
They didn't have any l.ong
l.ost Brothers at St. I.ouis, and I
am bound to say I think the
omission showed lack of consid
eration for weary visitors. I
thought once I had found one—
the first time 1 went up against
Gov. Major of Missouri.
As I have mentioned before,
this pale-faced and slender youth
cherished an Interesting impres
sion that he bad ■ boom for the
vice presidency, and was mani
festing it in the manner of Piko
County, from which favored re
gion he halls.
He took me warmly by the
hand and told me how well 1 was
looking, hut pretty soon he dis
covered that 1 was not a dele
gate, so'he, too, drifted away and
left me brotherless!
The reason why there was
no long-1 .oM-ISriithcr stunt
is because there isn't any
chance for the Iteal Hand
shaker at his best al a
Hlue Print convention.
Home conventions put to
sea under sealed orders, and
some are kindly furnished
with general instructions, aa
for Instance, to nominate
this man, not to nominate
that, and to be careful at all
times not to Hid- the Hand
That Feeds Yon!
But this convention was
furnished from Washington
at the start. «lib « complete
set of blue prints show ing
what It should do at every
moment of every hour of the
day and that precluded any
chance for contests, doubts,

TTfivinraiTT, m., June
17.—The "18 bunch" hud
their inning in the game for
the life or death of Will Or
pet today.
The " bunch"now only 16
strong—are school girls, chums
of Marian Lambert, and they
came into the big courtroom half
laughing, half frightened, and
took the stand, one after the
other, to aid the prosecution of
the youth who wrecked the life
of their friend.
They had been in court before,
but this was their day -the day
they were to refute the story of
Josephine Davis, now ostracised
from the "bunch," who said Mar
ian bad cried and threatened sui
cide on the day of her 1 Bth birth
day party, four days before her
body was found.
"She Was Dead."
Bernice Wells came first to the
stand.
"What did Marian Hay to you
when you left the Lambert home
the day of the Party?" the prose
cutor asked.
" 'Bernice, I am awfully glad
you could come,' that's what she
6aid." the witness answered.
"Then she said she would meet
me at Eleanor Double's home the
next Sunday."
"But she didn't meet you?"
asked the prosecutor.
"She was dead," Bernice an
swered.
Then the state got down to the
question it wanted brought out.
"Did you see .Marian go with
Josephine Davis in any other
room on the afternoon of the
birthday party?"
"I did not."
"Did you see her crying?"
"No."
Marian Was Crying.
Florence Russell came next.
"Did you see anyone crying at
the birthday party?" she waa
asked.
"Yes," said Florence. "Anna
Paulson was crying.''
"Anyone else?"
"Yes, Marian Lambert nnd
she both were crying together."
"What did Marian and Anna
say?" .
"Marian said: 'Anna, I'm aw
fully sorry you did not arrange
to stay all night with me. We
haven't missed staying together
on my birthday for 15 years.' "
"Was that al she was crying
about "
"Yes."
Tells of Engagement.
Then the state turned Miss
Russell over to Attorney Potter
of the defense for cross-examina
tion.
Florence admitted she was
"just friendly" with Marian and
that ehe was not alone with her
on the day of her birthday party.
"Marian told me Sunday morn
ing that she had learned Will
Orpet was engaged to Miss You
ker, and that Josephine had writ
ten Will and soon Will would
come down and tell her the
straight trutho f It," Miss Rus
sell aald.
On re-direct examination the
state brought out Marian had told
Florence that Orpet had been to
Lake Forest two weeks previous
to the birthday party, and had
slept in the garage on the Kup
penhelmer estate, because he had
something on the chauffeur and
could stay there any time he
wanted to and nobody would
know it.
"Marion told me Orpet was of a
passionate temperament," Miss
Russell said. "He would get mad
and fly off into a temper; Mar
lan said she liked him that way."
Then Miss Russell sprang the
testimony the state had waited
for.
"She Didn't Care."
"Marian," she said, "told me
once that she thought Josephine
Davis liked Will Orpet awfully
well. But Marian said she
didn't care about that. She
thought,U was JOiephlua'f feel
ing , for 'Orpet that made \tt
come to the lambert home so
btieo.''
Marian also had told her, she
said, that her parenta did not
want. Orypt to come to her home.

Whs Always Happy.
Contradicting the testimony of
Josephine Davis, chum of Marian
Luinbert, Mrs. Frank Lambert
took the stand as a witness
against Orpet.
The dead girl's mother declar
ed 11 in I Marian had .-einalned

she saw her, Feb. !», the day her
dead body was found in the

Marian's chum had leslifled
