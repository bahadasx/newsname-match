Progressive Leader Holds
Series of Conferences With
Roosevelt and AVhitnian
After Latter Calls Upon
the Republican Candidate
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
X EV( YORK, June 16. George W.
Perkins, progressive leader, after a
series of conferences today with Colo
nel Roosevelt and with Governor
Charles S. Whitman, announced that
negotiations were under way looking
to a "restoration of good feeling" be
tween progressives and republicans.
Mr. 1'erkins saw Governor Whit
man just after the governor had
culled upon Charles E. Hughes. The
progressive leader then returned to
call upon Colonel Roosevelt. He had
long talks with both."
W. Murray Crane, chairman of the
sub-committee of the republican na
tional committee which has authority
to select a manager for the Hughes
campaign, called on Colonel Roose-'
velt at his hotel date today. Both
declined to discuss what was consid
ered at their conference.
Colonel Roosevelt was asked re
garding the progress of negotiations
between the republicans and pro
gressives and was told of Mr. Per
kins" statement. He evinced surprise
at what Mr. Perkins had said.
"I know nothing about that," he
declared. "I have nothing to say.
If I have anything to say, I will say
It under my own signature."
Colonel Roosevelt's illness, it was
announced tonight after a consulta
tion with his physician, is nothing
more serious than a slight attack of
pleurisy.
"Colonel Roosevelt has a slight
touch of pleurisy," said Dr. Hubert
C. Guile, the physician in charge of
the case. "His illness is nothing to
worry about. His condition is thor
oughly satisfactory."
. Hughe Desires Harmony
WASHINGTON, June 16. Charles
E. Hughes, weary from a week of
strenuous political activity In New
York, rettrned to his home here to
night for the week-end. He retired
immediately, before hearing of George
W. Perkins' announcement regarding
peace negotiations between the re
publicans and progressives.
The nominee s apparent desire to
bring progressives and republicans
into accord is understood to have
been the theme of discussion in sev
eral conferences in New York be
tween Mr. Hughes and some of the
progressive leaders, notably Everett
Colby of New Jersey, Oscar S. Straus
and S. S. McClure, who called at the
Hughes headquarters there. To other
callers the nominee has voiced the
sentiment that the interests of both
progressives and republicans de
manded that differences should be
subordinated and harmony restored
before the actual work of the cam
paign is begun.
The desirability of bringing the
progressives under the republican
standard again was discussed also,
it is understood. In the long confer
ence Tuesday night between Mr.
Hughes and W. Murray Crane, chair
man of the republican national com
mittee on organization, who in turn
is said to have conferred with other
party leaders on the statement that
such a movement was on foot, but
indications have not been lacking
that peace overtures are imminent
Mr. Hughes has adhered steadfastly
to his announced policy to refrain
from discussing political affairs pub
licly until he is formally notified of
his nomination, and his advesors con
sidered it doubtful tonight If he
would depart from this policy to
comment on Mr. Perkins' announce
ment. Indications are that the attitude of
the progressives may have much
bearing on the nominee's selection of
a national chairman and campaign
manager. It became known tonight
that some progressive leaders have a
candidate for the chairmanship in
William Loeb, Jr., who was secre
tary to President Roosevelt.
During; his two-day stay In Wash
ington Mr. Hughes expects to devote
much time to the consideration of
eligibles for the place. His advisors,
however, are almost unanimously of

SUFFRAGE FIGHT
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
ST. LOUIS. June 16. Leaders of both
the Woman Party and the National
American Woman Suffrage association
tonight united in denouncing as- inade-
quate the suffrage plank of the demo
cratic platform and declared they
would immediately resume their fight
in congress for national recognition.
"We shall return to Washington as
quickly as possible," Miss Ann Martin,
chairman of the Woman's Party said.
"We are going to give the democratic
congress one more chance to make
good before adjournment If It does
not see fit to pass a constitutional
amendment war will follow.
"Some of the democratic leaders pre
tend to see a declaration for national
suffrage in the plank they have given
us. I do not so interpret It. Hut we
shall give congress leaders every
chance to read that Interpretation Into
it if they want to. I regard the demo
cratic plank weaker than the republi
can. The preamble of the latter is re
garded by some as giving national en
dorsement to suffrage.
"Thus far we have not worked out
details of our plans for fighting the
democratic party this fall, for we have
hopes that the congressional leaders
will see the light. But if they continue
to oppose us, we will fight them. And
it will be a good fight, too. We have
four million women voters, $5,000,000 In
cash, a good cause and a determined
spirit. With all of these we cannot
help but win."
Immediately after the adjournment of
the convention, Mrs. Carrie Chapman
Catt, president of the National Ameri
can Woman Suffrage association,
called a special meeting of her national
board and later issued the following
official statements:
"No suffragette who was present at
the convention today could misinterpret
either the speeches or the action taken
by tbe democratic party in adopting
the alleged wman suffrage plank in its
national platform.
"The democrats admitted freely In
their speeches that 'political exigency'
demanded 'some kind of a suffrage
plank' and they thought to hoodwink

NEW YORK, June 16. Although
500,000 strike ballots were ordered
printed here today by the delegates of
the four railroad brotherhoods who
failed to reach an agreement with the
railroads in their demand for shorter
hours and higher overtime pay, leaders
of the men and representatives of the
railroads united in the declaration that
while the situation is serious it is not
hopeless. The ballots are to be deliv
ered tomorrow and will be taken by the
land to "rehabilitate" himself by of
fering hi life to his country. The
punishment he would receive for de
serting from the German army, even
to "aid" the German cause In the
United States, he declared, would be
more severe than the prison term to
which he has been sentenced.
"If my life has to be wasted," he
said, "I might as well waste it for
my country and be of some use to
somebody. So far as punishment is
concerned, one day of drum fire Is
worse than ten years in prison."

Over Suffrage Plank
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
ST. I-OL'IS, June 16. The demo
cratic national convention finished Its
work today by adopyng the party
platform exactly as approved by
President Wilson and submitted by
the resolutions committee, including
the planks on Americanism and wo
man suffrage, but not until the har
mony of its three (fays' session had
been ruffled with a row over the suf
frage plank.
No voice was raised against the
vigorous declarations of the Ameri
canism plank. At one time it looked
as if the suffrage" plank had been
lost, hutN after Senator Walsh of
Montana had told the convention that
President Wilson himself, considered
it vital to party success it was voted
into the platform by a ballot of SSs'i
to lSlVa.
The whole platform then was adopt
ed without roll call.
As it went into the platform the
suffrage plank ' stands:
"We favor the extension of the
franchise to the women of this coun
try state by state, on the same terms
as to the men."
The woman suffrage leaders con
sidered it a much more favorable dec
laration than they got from the re
publican convention at Chicago: they
threw all their force behind and won
the support of the administration
leaders who were found fighting for
them when danger threatened.
Haggard and worn from an all night
pension th .platform makers were not
rertdv with their report until after
noon when Senator Stone, sleepless
for more than 30 hours, took the
speaker's stand and explaining that
he was too tired to read the docu
ment. gave over this task to Sens tor
Walsh of Montana and Senator Hoi
lis of New Hampshire.
The fight on the suffrage flank
was in the air. Everybody whs keved
un to It and when at the conclusion
of the reading of the platform. Mar
tin Lomasney of 'Boston, n delegate,
claimed the attention of the chair. It
vn thought that he was opening the
fight nnd It was several minutes be
fore the shouts of approval and cries
of disapproval could be stilled suffi
ciently to hear that he wanted to put
the convention on record as sym
pathizing with "the people of Ireland."
' T.aus mit him." roared a Baltimore
delegate and the convention hall
rocked with laughter.
The real fight broke immediately
after, however, when Governor Fergu
son of Texas, who headed the minor
ity report against the administration
plnnk, was given thirty minutes In.
which to present it.
The plank offered by the minority
wag this:
"The democratic party has always
stood for the sovereignty of the sev
eral states In the control and regula
tion of elections. We re-affirm the
historic position of our party in this
reenrrl and favor the continuance of

delegates to their homes for distribu
tion to expedite the voAe.
Bath the railroad managers and the
brotherhood leaders and delegates held
all-day long conferences. They dis
cussed. It was learned, policies for their
future conduct in the negotiations to
follow the return of a strike vote. The
brotherhood leuders are confident that
more than 85 per cent of the men will
vote in favor of a general strike, which
however, according to the wording of
the ballot, cannot be called until all
efforts toward an amicable adjustment
of their differences have failed.
Leaders of the railroads and the men
were reluctant to issue official state
ments today touching on the probability
of a compromise, but informal inter
views indicated that both sides louk ,to
a settlement through mediation under
the Newlands act. The railroads, the
employes believe, may drop at the last
moment their firm stand for the elim
ination of "double compensation" rules
and consent to arbitrate the questions
of hours and overtime.
Rather than precipitate a general
strike, brotherhood leaders intimated
the men might be satisfied with a nine
hour day and time and a quarter over
time, Instead of the eight-hour day and
time and a half overtime demanded.
The vote, leaders expect, will be can
vassed late, in July, after which they
will return here.

ST. LOCIS, June 16. A resolution
presented at a meeting of the demo
cratic national committee tonight pro
vided that the committee name its
own chairman and secretary from its
own membership and that the demo
cratic presidential nominee be em
powered to select a campaign com
mittee and name its officers, created
a sensation among the committeemen
fathered to effect their organization.
The resolution was defeated by a vote
of 40 to 3 after a debate that lasted
until after midnight.
During the debate on the resolution
the action of President Wilson in
suggesting the names of the officers
of the new committee was freely dis
cussed and national Committeeman E.
H. Moore of Ohio who presented the
resolution, declared that the president
should not have the pnver to impose
his will upon the committee and that
"I do not want to put it in the power
of any man to create a presidential
dymisty." After the resolution was
defeated the following officers of the
new committee were elected:
Vance McCormick of Pennsylvania,
chairman.
Homer dimming? of Connecticut,
vice chairman.
Representative Carter Class of Vir
ginia, secretary.
W. W. Marsh of Iowa, treasurer.
John I. Martin. Missouri, sergeant
at arms.
There have been reports for several
days that some of the national com
mitteemen were opposed to the Idea
that President Wilson name the of
ficers of the committee. , After sev
eral contests had been t eard the com
mute took tip the question of per
manent organization -and Mr. Mnore
offered a resolution that had been
eiven him by National Committeeman
Chirk Howell of Georgia, who was
forced by engagements to leave the
, rity. This resolution provided in ef
fect that a (nmiaign committee be
created to conduct the campaign un
til after the election and that in ac
cordance with the wish of the presi
dential nominee, Vance McCormick be
made its chairman and that the na
tional committee give its co-operation
to this compaign committee. This
resolution was withdrawn and one
from National Committeeman John T.
McGraw of West Virginia, was then
submitted.
The McGraw resolution provided
that the democratic national commit
tee name its own officers which hall
he selected from its own membership
and that the committee also appoint
n campaign committee to have entire
chirge of the campaign.
This resolution upon request, was
also withdrawn and Committeeman
Moore presented his resolution that
resulted in a debate of several hours.
The Moore resolution among other
things provided that, in the organiza
tion of the new national committee
its chairman nnd secretary should be
selected from its own membership;
that the demorcatlc nominee name, a
campaign committee together with Us
officers and that this campaign com
mittee should have sole conduct of
the campaign and no officer of the
democratic national committ"e should
have any authority in the campaign
unless delegated to it.
Speaking on his resolution Mr.

course because he felt that the com.
mit tee should have at least Been con
sulted in the selection of its officers.

BERLIN, (ia London) Jcne 16.
The managing committee of the Ber
lin Bourse today adopted the outlines
of a plan to restrict speculation,
which, although lacking official sanc
tion of the TJourso, has grown remark-
ablv active in recent months. The
committee ordered that all transac
tions shall be on a strictly cash basis
and with the date of delivery strictly
prescribed. Option and time trading:
will be prohibited, as will also the cir-
.culat'.on privately of price lists.
The action taken by the Bourse to
duv coincides with the wishes of the
government and tbe leading banks,
which rtgard it as inopportune that
wild speculations fchould disturb the
money market during the war.
It was designed to obviate the still
more rigorous measures contemplated
by the government Itself.

The forward drive of th Russian ar
mies in Volhynia, Galicla and Buko
wina continues with apparently un
diminished successes. From the Pripet
marshes southward to Czernowitz the
forces of General Ilrusiloff, according to
reports from Petrograd, are throwing
back counter attacks and are advanc
ng. In thirteen days the Russians have
taken prisoner almost 170,000 men and
have captured immense stores of war
booty, says the Russian war official
reports.
Battles southeast of Lutsk, between
Kozin and Tarnovka and northwest of
Buczacz have brought further success
es to the Russian arms. In an action
on the Buichevka river, southeast of
Lutsk, more than 500 men were cap
tured after the attacking Russians' had
forded the river. The fighting con
tinues northwest of Buczacz, where the
Germans are co-operating with the
Austrians, but the Russians report the
capture here thus far of 6,000 men from
the Teutons.
Attempts of the Austrians and Ger
mans to take the offensive on many
sectors of the long front were repulsed,
according to Petrograd. The Russian
war office also chronicles the repulse of
attacks in the region of Sokul, south
east of Kovel, one of the objectives of
the present Russian drive. Berlin re
ports the capture of 400 Russians dur
ing an attack on a German position
north of ' Przewloka. Around Verdun
the French and German armies were
inactive during the day, there having
been only intermittent bombardments.

The notice was signed by Jesus Val

At the office of General George

of the order was given, it being as
serted that the orders were "mere
precautionary measures."
Included in the troops ordered to
quarters were the provost guard
and Paris says that it has been con
firmed that the French attack of last
Thursday on the slope south of Le Mort

German trenches on a front of about
two-thirds of a mile.
