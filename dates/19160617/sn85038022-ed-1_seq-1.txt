STATE WARRANT RILL HELD IN
VALID HY COURT OP APPEALS
DECISION
Frankfort, Ky., June 16 The Court
of Appeals today held unconstitutional
tho State warrant bill passed by the
last General Assembly.
This bill was passed as an attempt
ed remedy for the State's financial
difficulties, and provided that tho State
warrants now outstanding, amounting
to sovcral million dollars, might bo
called In and new warrants Issued,
Issued, having a deflnlto date of ma
turity. Tho bill also provided that the sink
ing fund commissioners might bor
row monoy In anticipation of the an
nual revenues and Issue Stnto war
rants for such sums borrowed.
Tho effect of tho bill would havo
been to innkc State warrants ncgotla
blu Instruments, and having n definite
dato of maturity, they would havo
commanded a better price In the
money market and could havo been
Issued at a lower rato of interest than
at present. Stnto warrants now bear
flvo per cent, interest, and their date
of payment Is Indefinite, being re
deemed In the order of tholr lssuo, as
rapidly on funds accumulate in the
treasury.
The opinion of tho Court of Appeals
was that the State constitution limits
tho bonded Indebtedness of the State to
$500,000, and thnt this limitation acts
as a bar to the legality of tho effect
of bonds. It will also prevent the sink
Inn fund commissioners from borrow
ing money on warrants In anticipation
of annual revenues.
Tho bill was relied upon by Gover
nor Stanley nnd his administration as
a step toward reducing tho steadily In
creasing State debt, it being antici
pated that from $30,000 to $.r0,000 per
year would bo saved by the new form
of warrant None had been Issued by
tho State Treasurer pending the Court
of Appeals decision.
M Charles Hancock has returned
to his homo In West Third Btreet nftcr
