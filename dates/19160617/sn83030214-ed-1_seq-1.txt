St. l.ouis, .lune 17. The "harmony"
gathrring which ended here yesterday
afternoon already has its undertow. Al?
though the Iiomocratir convention ad
journerl with all fartions seemingly in
n.-iord, behind the sr?nes laat night
there was a battle not at all in aceord
ance with the "peRceful" platform
adopted earlier in the day.
Oreat bitterness was manifeat at th?
meeting of the naConal committee sum
moned to ratify the President'a choice
of Vance McCormick as national chair?
man. Although the Pennsylvania lead
er waa Anally elected by a vote of tt
to 2, sparks were struck that may lead
to further fires.
What the leaders particularlv reaent
ia the way in which Wilr.on rode rnugh
shorl over them in the conduct nf the
convention and the choice of the cam?
paign beada. After they had been
aaked to "adviae" the President their
suggestions were entirely ignored

Hit at McCormick.
The two men most prominently er
pressing their objection to ?he Treai
dent's course arara Colonel John J. Mr
Graw, of Wc.t Virgiala, and K. H.
Moore, of Ohio. No sooner had the
rontests for national committeemen
boOB disposed of than Judge Moore
-','irted his fight. Me introduccd a
resolution providing that the Presi?
dent be entrusted with sole charge of
the campaign and that the committee
aeleel ita chairman from its own num?
ber. This. of course, wa- a rlirert
slap ai McCormick.
A Mitchell I'almer, a warm friend of
the President, tried to block Judge
Mooro'a plan, when the latter cried out:
"I protest egainst the gag rule in
this cnnitnittee," and he protested so
forcefully that. Chairman McCombl
yielded the floor. Me read a quotation
from one r.f the Prcsidcnt's speeches,
in which Mr. Wilson said: "We do not
take order- from nnvbndy," and he
added: "Those are my sentiments."
"1'nder my resolution." .ludge Moor<*
continued, "we turn over ?o the Presi?
dent the entire conduc <f the cam-j
raipn, and do not hamper him in thei
slignteat."
The committeeman referred to the
DBC al the committeemen as "rubber

continued:

other Carranza officer in Mexico will
not in any way afTect General Persh
inif's ordera as to the movements of hia
troopa. These orders are to take any
steps to suppress Mexiean bandits that
he may deem neressary. He has been
in-tructed, however, not to advance hla
lines further, except in pursuit of out
laws nr in defence of his own men
N'eithcr the State Department nor
the War Department has received con

These announcements, particuiaCv
the latter, are reicarderj as refuting the
repeated rumors that Carranza's power
