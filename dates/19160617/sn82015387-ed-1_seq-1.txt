JUDGEPRE[NTISS CARTER
Prentiss B. Carter,
Made Judge 26th
District Court.
Hon. Prentiss B. Carter, who has
just been appointed to the benL.' of
the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District
Court, is well known in the Florida
parishes, where he was reared. He
received his rudimentary education
at the Jesuit College, New Orleans,
He taught school in Livingston, Tan
gipahoa and Washington parishes, af
ter his marriage, at the same time
being engaged in farming. He com
pleted his law course under Judge
Stephen D. Ellis, whose great legal
knowledge laid the foundation for
the success that has met Judge Cart
er in the practice of his profession
in the Florida parishes and in the
Federal Courts of New Orleans.
Judge Carter was admitted to the
bar twenty-fve years ago, since
which time he has resided in Frank
Iinton, Washington parish. He is
known as an able lawyer and it is
predicted that he will maka an able
judge for this district. He has not
been an office-seeker. The only pub
lie position he has previously held
was that of Assistant Attorney Gen
eral, filling the unexpired term of
Hon. G. A. Condran, deceased.
Judge Carter was the selection of
the Bar Association for his present
position. He has made many warm
friends in St. Tammany parish. and
he is universally popular in his home
town, Franklinton. Being a self
made man, he has acquired habits of
thought and reasoning, the liberal
and broad-minded trainibh that
comes from contact with the world,
that should add to his legal knowl
edge the qualities to be desired in a
judge.

kind a welcome social feature.
There were 175 present and the
dancing was kept up to a late hour.
The entertainment part of the pro

the best that could be found outside
the professional field, while the in

The report of Auditor Abernathy
Was sensational in its nature. It re
cited various irregularities that,
while illegal, vwere not in any sense
criminal. Tbere-were other portions
of the report that bear evidences on
the face of misappropriation' by. the
secretary, E. D.. Kentsel. 'Mr. Kent
sel made the positive statement, how
ever, that all these matters could :b
explained, and that if the auditor
had been in possession of facts not
disclosed to him in the records and
documents examined he would have
understood the transactions. Audi
tor Abernathy said he was makin.
no charges, but was slamply supplying
the facts as they -Jessted. If any
thing could bet eapineed away he
would be glad: to have it done.
Time. was given Mr. Kintse in
which to go- over the report and to
show that the errors were in ap
pearance and not in fact.

e The formal opening of the Sum

'r saditbriumu of the Covington High
Schoot Tuesday at 10 a. m.
~ Rev. H. A. Goering, of the Baptist
Church, opened the proceedings with
s the singing of the Doxology, follow
ed by a fervent prayer for the suc
cess of the school and for the health
and strength of faculty and pupils.
Mayor Paul J. Lacroix then ad
dressed a hearty welcome to the
school. He said:
'It is a pleasant duty devolving up
on me, as mayor of our little city
in theapines, in the heart of the Ozone
Belt, to welcome you in out midst,
, you ladles and ,'entlemen, entrusted
with- the education of our youth.
I shall not weary you with an ex
e tended harangue, as the work before
you is at hand, and the weather
warm.
'I feel that I voice the sentiment of
every citizen in Covington in bidding
each and every one a hearty wel
come, and hoping that your stay
r among us will be as pleasant as
t fraught with benefits derived by your
short stay. Again in the name of
Covington, and in behalf of Coving
tonians, I extend to you a hearty
welcome.
Sept. Lyon also expressed his great
appreciation of having the school
come to Covington, and spoke of the
many reasons why it was an ideal
place for such a school. He hoped
all would enjoy its healthfulness and
its pure waters. That there was
good fishing, boating, pleasant shady
walks, good roads and a bealtiful
park. He wished all to get the full
est enjoyment out of these oppor
tunities and that they would be pleas
ed with their stay here.
S10onductor A. J. Caldwell respond- I
ed to the weleoming words of Mayor
Lacroix and Supt. Lyon. He said
that in viewing Covington he realiz
ed that all the obligations were on
the side of the school. Covington c
was a beautiful place, with fine
streets and shady trees and excellent A
outlaying roadways. That the hand- r
some school building, with its equip
ment,- made an admirable place for J
the holding of the school. With it: I
welcoming churches and hospitable
people he felt that their stay in Cov- '
ington would not be only profitable h
in the matter of education, but so
cially.
(Mrs., Clifton Burns was received a
with applause as she passed up to the
foot of the platform. She said that a
she wished the school attendants E
and faculty to feel perfectly at home.
That the different women's societies a
would be pleased to have them at C
their meetings, and especially the U
School ,League. The churches of a
Covington were open to them, and 1l
the hoped they would find pleasure
in the park and walks and othei a.
pleasant places around Covington b
and that their stay here would -be 0
one of pleasure and profit. P
Prof. Caldwell had the teachers of
the different departments maKe their ri
assignments. He was full of humor ai
and the stiff formality of this pro m
ceeding was enlivened by joking re di
marks applicable to members of the e~
faculty, who in turn slipped one t< m
him when the occasion presented. ai
The 1144 enrolled made the open- to

similar school held in the Florid- l

An effort is -being made to make cc
