A Laxative Blood Cleanser
Don't put off taking a treatment of
Po-IDo-Lax. Your system needs a clean
snr and tonic-nothing like Po-Do-Lax
to purify the blood, gently move the
bowels and stlimulate the liver to heal
thy action. The first dose releases the
accumulated poison". It is a laxative
tonic for young, adult and aged. Its
mild non griping action commends it
to delicate women. Guaranteed-a trial
will convince you. Giet a bottle to-day.
Compulsory Dipping.
The Legislature now in session
has passed a compulsory dipping
law. Those parishes which were
the first to dip their cattle and got
rid of the tick, it is the parishes
that are slow to build vats that
have to be forced to it. When
our vat was built here last year by
a few of our people who knew the
benefit of dipping dipped only
their own stock, the people in gen
eral not believing in the dip, but
this year more then a thousand
head have been dilppedl and the vat
is busy every day with new stock
coming.
Let everybody work for the com.
munity's good, whether they get
anything out of'it or not.
