We present herewith the offi
cial map of the good roads sys
tem of the National 'Highways
Association. This organization
has no entangling political, sec
tional or commercial alliances.
It is strictly organized for busi
ness, and lives up to its motto,
"Good Roads Everywhere." It
embraces in its membership the
governors of nearly every State
Ike Fewclothes Heard From.
Fordyce, Ark., June 5.
No doubt my many friends,
and enemies too, for that matter,
will be surprised to hear from
me in this far off strange land,
and some of them may feel un
easy for my safeness so far awa·"
from my native parish of Grant,
but I am getting accustomed to
the ways of the people of this
country and like it fine. I am
getting the Chronicle and notice
that everything is moving along
nicely. That is one good provis
ion in the Louisiana constitution,
which provides ways and means
for everything to be carried on
all right without any serious hitch
over the loss of prominent men
who move to other States. I was
afraid that there would be trou
ble along all lines of public en
deavor when I left down there,
but I have been a little surprised
to note that there has been little
change, and really it appears
that the vacancy which my dis- I
appearance created has proved ,
to be for the general good, the 1
same being satisfactory, as I like
to be a public benefactor one way
or another. If I can't serve the t
people heroically by remaining i
with them, I will prove myself I
patriotic by leaving, thus win- t
ning the esteem of the public in t
this way. c
Arkansas is a great State in i
some ways, but when anybody r
tells you that it has the edge on a
old Louisiana, just tell them that l
they have another guess coming. a
One way that Arkansas is ahead a
i- in the Union, besides thousands
a- of the best representative citi
rs zens of all the States. In the
n last few years this Association
- has systematized and unified the
s. entire country so that the estab
i- lished State -highways and tnta
>, tive roads of all the different
[t highway associations have been
e woven into a perfect system of
e which the map above is an an
of Louisiana is in the productionr
of fruits. They are shipping
1, many car loads of peaches, straw
. berries, cantaloupes, etc., from
n many points and the returns are
good. Louisiana should grow
more fruits.
In the matter of laws, I find
after tireless study on the subject
that Louisiana is far ahead of
this State. A lawyer herE, is not
1 looked upon as being any more
important than a member of the
lower house of the legislature,
while in Louisiana he is held to
be the same as the Egyptian idol
I of old. There is no such thing
here as a police jury. The jus- 1
tice of the peace from each town- j
ship (called wards in Louisiana)
acts in the same capacity as the
Louisiana member of the police
jury. They meet at the court I
house now and then and tranact
business much after the fashion I
of the Grant parish police jury, I
but not nearly so thorough oi' ,
business-like, and the gentleman I
called the "county judge" is the '
boss of the county, so far as the t
general business is concerned. .c
He presides like the president of
the police jury in Louisiana, and
if there is anything to be bought
he does the buying. I don't like
this quite so well. Then comes 1
the worst feature of it all, that
of the court arrangements. Court I
is held at intervals of every six
months. There is a circuit j'udg+ 1I
and prosecuting attorney, who
have about six counties to pre- t
side over and they ean only get
around about twiou annually. "
s thoritative and official presenta
- tion.
e We hope to see Grant parish
n maintain the prominent place she
e has occupied in the good roads
- column, and fully expect within
- the next year or so to see her
t duly connected up with the
i splendid system of roads now be
f ing built in Louisiana, which is
-also a part of the Nations high
SThus, if a man commits a lawless
deed which does not admit of
bail, he reclines in the county jail
i at public expense for six months,
as the case may be. This is a
bad feature of the legal machin
ery here and makes it hard on
that contingency of the popula- t
tion known as legal talent. An- ,
other thing noticeable here is the J
issuance of parish scrip or war- E
rants in payment for indebted
ness against the county. I do c
not know if this prevails all over
this State, but it does in this
county, one of the wealthiest of h
the State, and there is much h
trading and trafficing in this pa- to
per. One company here makes "
a business of buying up these CJ
county warrants at a low price n
and collecting face value from ,
them a year or two years later, y
when the county judge "calls a
them in. This is also an error.
Later on I hope to be able to ar
range for a few reforms in the
running gear of this common
wealth, but, of course, will have
to get acquainted before I pro
.eed very radically. ti

Bowel Complaints in India.
In a lecture at one of the Des Moines, of
Tows, churches a missionary from In- o
dia told of going into the interior of
India, where he was taken sick, that ol
he had a bottle of Chamberlain's Colic, re
Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy with m
him and believed that it sated his life. to
This remedy is used sucdessfully in at
India both as a preventativ sand cure a
for cholera. You may know frem this
that it can be depended nsp for the
milder forms of bwel eoml int that

Twelve miles of our roads have

Why Endure Summer Colds?
It isn't necessary to have a stuffed
head, running nose. To cough your
head off as it were. All you need do is
to use Dr. Bell's Pine-Tar-Honey. The
soothing and healing balsams open the
clogged air passages and in a short
time you get relief and start on the
road to recovery. Your nose stope
running, you cough less and'ou know
you are getting better. Get a bottle,
use as directed. Keep what is left as
a cough and cold insurance.-Adv.-2.
