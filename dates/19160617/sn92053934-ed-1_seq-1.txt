THE WAR TODAY
There are no signs of a cessa
tion of the powerful Kussian often
she in Volhynia-Galicia and Kuko
wina. The latent Austrian official
statement tells f a Russian
check here and there, notably the
defeat of a cavalry force south of
the Dniester in Galicia and the
stopping of Russian efforts across
the Stork hod and Srjr in Vol
hynia, The Russians, however,
are remaininer on the airsrressive,
attacking all alone the Yolhynian
front and pressing hard atrainst
the Austrian lines further south.
The capture of approximately
170,000 men by the Russians since
the inception of the offensive is
claimed by PotrogTad which de
clares that steady advances arc
beimf scored against the Aus
trian armies.
French positions in the Dead
.Man's Hill sector, northwest of Ver
dun, are acaln the object of Ger
man attacks, the hie (runs of the
crown prince violently shelling
the French trenches. The only
infantry movements that develop
ed, however, were a hand grenade
attack slightly west of the hill,
which the French repulsed and a
similar attack on the Avoreourt
redoubt to the southwest which
also failed.
There is still pronounced activ
ity on the Trentino front where
the Austrian and Italians are at
grips but no advances of conse
quence, on either side is claimed
in the latest reports.
The British destroyer Eden
sank as the result of a collision
in the Huglish channel. Three of
licers are missing.
The Russians continue to beat
back the Anstrians and to capture
prisoners at the rale of more than
10,000 a day, 170JHH) Teutonic al

13 days, besides vast quantities of
guns and munitions. Attempts of
the Anstrians and Germans to
take the offensive at many points
alonp the entire front have been
repulsed, according to Petrograd.
The armies around Verdun are
inactive again, only intermittent
bombardments having occurred for
practically two days. The French
claim 1 have captured German
trenches on a front of about two
thirds of a mile in the vicinity of
Le Mort Homme.
The British claim fresh suc

PREPARE FOR
WORSTALONG
RORDER LINE
Everything Being Done to
Be Ready for Eventuali
ties With Carranza.
ALL IN READINESS
General Funston Has Force
of 50,000 in Command
Expresses No Fear.
El Paso, Jnne 17. Carranza
having thrown down the gauntlet
to the United States in his adTices
to General Fershine that any
troop movement east, west or
south wonld be regarded as a hos
tile act every preparation was be
iner made alon? the border today
for eventualities
Officers and soldiers of the Ameri
can garrison, here were kept closely
to their quarters. Street car service
to Juarez was at. a standstill and ef
forts were made by the United States
customs officials to persuade Ameri
cans not to cross the river.
Tension was noticeable on the Mex
ican side, where nnmbers of civilians
were arming themselves. Reports
from authentic sources indicated that
recruiting for the army was being
pushed in all the larger cities in north
ern Mexico.
Watch Do Facto Troops.
San Antonio, Texas, June 17. Gen
eral Funston and his staff gave care
ful attention today to the activities of
outlaw bands along the Mexican bor
der, but far greater interest wa.i dis
played in the attitude being assiir.ied
by the troops of the de lacto govern- I
ment. j
General Parker at Brownsville,
Texas, made a brief report early this
morning ot the latest mannestation
of outlawry near San Benits, and Gen
eral I.Iann reported the continuation
of the search for traces of the bandits
that raided the cavalry camp at Sa'i
Ignacio, but it was evident at depart
ment headquarters that greater sig
nificance was attached to the doings
of Carranza's troops than to those of
the bandit leaders.
General Ricaut's warning that the
crossing of the border by any Ameri
can troops for any cause whatever
would be regarded as an overt act by
the United States and would be the
cause of attack by the de facto gov
ernment troops did not disturb Gen
eral Funston or his staff. The search
for bandits will continue and when
ever a "hot trail" is found leading into
Mexico the American troops will not
hesitate to follow it. The officers in
charge of troops on the border have
such instructions that the crossing of
the international line will not be de
layed by reports. They have the au
thority to cross without waiting for
special instructions.
Fnnston Has ,50,000.
General Funston's army of almost
50,000 has been so disposed along the
Mexican border that swift punitive
action could be taken if invited by any
overt act of Carranza's army. Gen
eral Jacinto Trevino's threat to attack
General Pershing if the American
troops move east or west or south,
was regarded by army officers here
as little less than a declaration of
hostilities by the Mexicans, since it
may be necessary at any time for the
leader of the big punitive expedition
to send small detachments in pursuit
of outlaw bands that may be menac
ing his outposts. No fear is felt, how
ever, that General Pershing will not
be able to take care of himself.
Take Precautions.
Precautions taken by General Bell
at El Paso last night in holding all
the American troops ready for action
were similar to those taken at every
border point opposite which there was
any considerable number of Carranza
troops. The greatest activity was dis
played at Juarez, because military au
thorities there armed a portion of the
civilian population and because of the
recent reinforcement of the Mexican
garrison. General Greene at Eagle
Pass and Genera! Mann at Laredo also
prepared to move quickly in case of
eventualities, but less activity on the
Mexican side of the river was dis
played at those points.
Washington, June 17. Warning from
Mexican commanders that any move
ment of American troops except in re
tirement toward the border would pre
cipitate hostilities will not change the
purpose of the United States govern
ment to keep its expedition in northern
Mexico or prevent General Pershing
from taking any steps necessary to in
sure, thP safetv of his own columns
and deal with bandits threatening the
border No advance furtner soutn is
contemplated and it is not believed
horn the Carranza forces are planning
an immediate attack upon the present
American forces.
The war department today was with
out advices from General Pershing re
tarding the warning said to have been
sent him by General Trevino the Car
ranza commander at Chihuahua, but
General Funston reported the sub-

Springfield, 111., June 17. The Illi
nois public utilities commission was
netitionerl her--- today by Jacob G.
Grossberjr of Chi - urn to otfle- u.e ele
vated rt-roiuis to remove" the Van
Buren street :trra of the "loop" in Chi
cago from Fifth avenue to Wabash
avenue.
During the rush hours the peak of
the transportation load in Chicago
the capacity of the loop for the con
tinuous passage of trains is overtaxed,
according to Mr. Grossbcrg, who says
he has been a citizen of the state and
a resident of Chicago for many years.
But for the loop, his petition adds,
the natural tendency of the central
business portion of Chicago would be
to spread in a general southward di
rection from Van Buren street.
Mr. Grossbcrg would have north and
south side trains operated continuous
ly over the Wabash avenue and Lake
street arms of the loop. West side
trains, he says, should be brought into
the city at Van Buren street, traverse
the west side of the Fifth avenue arm
of the loop and leave tho Lake street
elevated tracks.
The crossovers at the intersection of
West Van Buren street and south
Fifth avenue and at West Lake street
and North Fifth avenue are wholly un
necessary and a nuisance, according
to Mr. Grossbcrg.
The commission will give Mr. Gross
berg's petition an early hearing.

State Summons rcvy of lonner Friends
of .Marian to Disprove Josephine
Davis' Testimony.
?1
Wankegah.' lIl;;,iane'fl7'.--The,' state
today brought a bevy of girls to court
to impeach the testimony of Josephine
Davis in the trial of William H. Orpct
for the alleged murder of Marian
Lambert.
There were 18 of !thera acli"43-
years of age and they had attended
Marian's ISth birthefay party on Feb.
6, three days before her death in
Helm's woods at Lake Forest.
Bernice Wells first took the stand.
Over the objections of the defense, she
testified that Marian seemed happy at
the party. She did not see her cry,
as Miss Davis in her revised testimony
said she did.
"So far as you know were Josephine
and Marian alone at any time during
the party?" asked State's Attorney
Dady.
"Not that I know of."
On cross examination by Attorney
Ralph E. Potter he asked:
"Did Marian always appear gay
gayer than others as if she were try
ing to hide her troubles behind a mask
or gaiety r t
i woman i say uiai sue just seem
ed happy."
In attempting to find out if Marian
and Josephine had been alone to
gether, Mr. Potter brought out the
answer that the guests "were all over
the house."
A demure miss in unadorned blue
came next. She smiled innocently at
Mr. Dady when asked her name and
responded in a clear, unafraid voice
"Florence Russell."
She was born at Racine, Wis., 18
years ago.
She and two friends spent the night
of the party with Marian. Anna Paul
son, who always had done so, was un
able to stay.
"Did you see Josephine Davis take
Marian aside into a room?" asked Mr.
Dady.
"No, sir."

Phillip Hanna Abandons Po
sition and Hurries to
United States.
San Antonio, Texas, June 17.
General Pershing: has told General
Jacinto Trevino in reply to the
message warninjr him that anv
move-of the American troops ex
cept toward the border wonid be
regarded as a hostile act that he
coold not recognize his authority
to govern the movements of the
American expedition. The text of
the message from General Persh
ing was received today by General
iunston and forwarded to Wash
inirton. Washington, June 17, General
Fnnston advised (lie war depart
ment today that he was informed
by General Bell at El Paso, that
General Pershintr had been
warned by General Trevino, the
4 arranza commander at CbJhna
hna that any movement of the
American expedition to the south,
west or east wonld he a signal for
an attack by the Mexican forces.
' sT " . . ?-'
i 'AQ word has come so far from Gen-1
eral Pershing himself, but even before- -'
the arrival of General Funston's mes
sage department officials were in- .
cllned :to--credit newspaper dispatches
telling of the- Trevino warning.
Preparations have been made for
any eventualities and Pershing is
ready to. deal with any force that may .
be seftit against him. It is probable,
however, that he will hold to his pres
ent lines and make no move to pre
cipitate hostilities.
Gray Force Returns. i
General Funston reported also that
Major Gray of the Fourteenth cavalry,
commanding the two troops attacked
by Mexicans at San Ignacio, Texas,
recently, had returned from an effort
to pick up the trail of the bandits.
The cavalry rode some distance down
the American side of the river,
crossed to the Mexican side on reports
that a bandit mobilization was in prog
ress, turned north again on the Mex
ican side for several miles and re
crossed it to American territory with
out having encountered any outlaws
or finding a trail.
Two additional prisoners were cap
tured on the American side and the
body of another Mexican found in the
brush near the scene of the attack.
Assure Cooperation.
Major Jray reported he had re
ceived assurances of cooperation from
Carranza military commanders across
the line. The Mexican officers saii
they had captured 20 men believed to
have been engaged in the attack oi
the American camp.
The American commander said he
believed the band had been broken up
and that no further activities were to
be expected from that particular force.
Consul Quits Post
Laredo. Texas, June 17. Phillip C.
Hanna, United States consul general
at Monterey and one of the two re
maining American consuls in Mexico,
accompanied by half a dozen other
Americans, arrived here today. He
was reticent as to the object of his
visit.
Asked regarding conditions in Mex
ico and the probable length of his
stay, Consul Hanna replied: "Every
thing is quiet down the line. I may
remain 2 or 3 days."
It has been known for some time
that Consul Hanna was instructed by
the state department that he could
leave his post any time at his own
discretion.
Consul Hanna immediately on his
arrival asked for an American news
paper. Ho appeared surprised when
he glanced at the headlines but would
not comment on overnight develop
ments. The arrival at Laredo today of Philip
Hanna, consul general at Monterey,
developed that fact that the state de
partment ordered both him and J. U.
Silliman, consul at Saltillo, to the
American side of the river. The with
drawal of these two consular officers,
will leave the American government
with no consular representatives at
interior points in Mexico, except an
agent at Mexico City.
Fearing' Attack.
Laredo, Texas, June 17.- Texas
rangers, under command of Captain
J. J. Sanders and several armed citi
zens were hurried early today to
lslatas, 25 miles up the Rio Grande
from liredo, on a report that Mexi
can bandits were seen approaching the
settlement
Few details of the reported proposed
attack were available. Rangers Ju
that vicinity, however, advised the few
Americans to congregate at the J. B.
Morrow ranch house, whence a re-'
quest for aid was telephoned.
