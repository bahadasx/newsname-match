EL PASO, Texas, June 17. ("arranza having defied the United
States by his advice to Pershing tiiat any movement exeept retreat
of American troops would be regarded as a hostile aet, preparations
were made along the border todajfor eventualities. Soldiers here
remained in close quarters and street ear serviee to Juarez was
stopped. LftortM were made by United States customs officers to
persuade Americans not to erons the line. The tension is noticeable
on the Mexican side, where a number of civilians are mining.
It is reported from an authentic source that recruiting for the
army is being pushed throughout the larger cities of northern
Mexico.
Diplomatic offices believe the warning was intended for homa
consumption and a political move to offset the activities of the
anti-American element.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, June 17. ieneiul Uuiiston and staff
have carefully considered the activities of outlaws along the border,
but gave greater interest to the attitude assumed by the troops of
the de facto government, to whose movements great significance was
attached, according to the view of the staff.
The warning that crossing the bonier by American troops for
any cause whatever'would be the signal for attack by the de faeto
troops has not disturbed Funston.
The search into Mexican territory after the bandits will continue.
Funston 's 50,000 troops are disposed along the border so that swift
action could be taken.
Aaarlate4 Preaa.)
WASHINGTON, June 17. The letter from ('arranza warning
that any movement of troops exeept in the way of retirement would
be taken as a cause for hostilities will not change the purpose of
the United States government' to keep the Pershing expedition in
northern Mexico or to prevent Pershing taking steps necessary for
insuring the safety of his column and deal with the bandits threat
ening the border.
No advance further south is contemplated.
It is not believed the ('arranza forces are planning an immediate
attack. No adviees have been received from Pershing by the
secretary of war regarding the Trevine warning, but General
Funston reported that, such warning had been given.
(By Aieociated Pre.)
WASHINGTON, June 17. Although the United States reply
to Carranza's last note is completed, the sending is delayed by
administration officials seeking detailed information of recent devel
opments. Additions are probable.
The United States will reaffirm its purpose not to interfere
in Mexican affairs unless . forced by continued and aggravated
attacks on American territory which have been reported.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, June 17. The arrival at Laredo of
Coiuis'ul Phillip Ilanna today developed the fact that the United
States had ordered both him and Consul Silliman at Saltillo to
the American side of the river.
The withdrawal leaves the American government with no con
sular representative in Mexico outside of Mexico City.
Hy Aaawlatrd Preaa.)
LAREDO, Texas, June 17. It is reported that more than 5000
("arranza troops passed Villadama, 100 miles south of here, going
northward. This confirmed the report that Mexican troops are
arriving from the interior.

LAREDO, Texas, June 17. Texas rangers and armed citizens
have been hurried to Islitas on the report that Mexican bandits
were approaching. Few details are available.
Due to the vigilance of rangers the Islitas raid did not occur.

HROWNSVILLE, Texas, June 17. Revival of bandit activity
on the lower Rio (Irande has resulted in vigorous action by the
authorities, which is interpreted as presaging a determined attempt
to check a recurrence of outlawry on American soil. Troops
hereafter will endeavor to deal with the bandits on the American
side of the boundary.
