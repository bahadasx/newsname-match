o Advance Further South,
However, Is Contemplated.
Washington. June 17. The United
States today apparently is nearer ac
tual warfare with the Carranza army
than at any time during the late con
troversy with Mexico. With stinging
rebukes of two Carranza generals tin-
i-linK in Uncle Sam s ears, eacn teen

niwe'by United States men in any di-
itction except northward wouiu oe .

C.rande in pursuit of bandits wouia db
n.iisidered an act of warfare, the two
armies marshaled along the border to
i!6V figuratively are glaring at each
cirjir. Keyed up to fighting at tl
i Kin of the hat."
Warning from Mexican commanders
that anv movement ot American
troops except in retirement toward the
boruer would precipitate nostniLiet,,
will not cnange the purpose of the
I nited States government to keep its
expedition in northern Mexico or pre
vent General Pershing from taking
steps necessary to insure the safety of
his columns and deal with bandits
threatening the border. No advance
lurther south is contemplated and it
is not believed here the Carranza
forces are planning any immediate at
tack upon the . present American
forces.
The war department today was
without advices from General Persh
ing regarding th'e warning said to have
lieen sent him by General Trevino, the
Carranza commander at Chihuahua,
but Ueneral Funston reported the
Mibstance of a telephone conversation
he hart with General Bell, at El Paso,
who stated it as a fact that such a
warning had been given. As he has no
direct communication with General
Pershing, it is assumed he was told
of the warning by Mexican officials
at Juarez or El Paso. This is not
legarded as confirmation of Chihua
hua City press dispatches saying the
warning had been given on orders
from Carranza himself.
No Change in Policy.
Secretary Lansing said today the
policy of the United States was un
changed. He added that the state de
partment's reply to General Carranza's
belligerent note demanding the with
drawal of the American forces prob
ably would not go forward today.
11 is being held up for possible ad
ditions covering the San Ygnacio fight
und also authentic information as to
General Trevino's reported ultima.
tl m.
There were no indications at the
department that steps were being
taken to strengthen the border forces
with the additional national guards
men. While precautionary steps to
ward mobilizing the state troops were
taken some time ago. no new orders
tc that end have gone out recently.
It was noted here that American
troops crossed into Mexico yesterday
near San Ygnacio, Texas, without be
ing attacked. In fact. Major Gray,
commanding the two troops which
scoured the south bank of the Rio
Grande in search of bandits, reported
he had received offers of co-opera
tion from the Carranza commanders
in the vicinity.
Might lie Political Move.
Diplomatic officials were Inclined to
believe that if General Trevino did
nerve a warning, it was done for home
consumption rather than as a prelude
to hostilities. They thought it might
he a political move by General Car
ranza designed to offset the activities
of the anti-American element in Mex
ico, without actually forcing hostili
ties. Border Nervousness Grows.
EI Paso, Texas, June 17. General
Carranza. having thrown down the
gauntlet to the United States in his
advices to General Pershing that any
troop movement east, west or south,
wculd be regarded as a hostile act,
every preparation was being made
along the border today for any even
tuality. Officers and soldiers of the Amer
ican garrison here were kept closely
t-j their quarters. Street car service
to Juarez was at a standstill and ef
forts were made by United States cus
toms officials to persuade Americans
not to cross the river.
Tension was noticeable on the Mex
ican side, where numbers of civilians
were arming themselves. Reports
from authentic sources indicated that
recruiting for the army was being
pushed in all the larger cities in north
ern Mexico.
There were no indications of un
toward developments in this vicinity
during the right.
Find New Bandit Trail.
Brownsville, June 17. It was re
ported tc army headquarters today
that a troop of the Third cavalry, un
der Lieut A. D. Newmans, had struck
a hot trail" of Mexican bandits north
of Brownsville. These bandits were
supposed to have been the same who
attacked United States soldiers near
San lienito last night.

It is not known whether any of the

Travelers from Del Rio said today
that 200 Mexicans have crossed the
line there. This could not be confirm
ed at Funston's headquarters. Ameri

nouncement:
"Volunteers wanted for immediate

No Word From Pershing.
Washington, June 17. No word has
come so far from General Pershing
himself, but even before the arrival
of General Funston's message, depart
ment officials were inclined to credit
newspaper dispatches telling of the
Trevino warning. Preparations have
been made for any eventualities and
Pershing is ready to deal with any
force that may be sent against him.
It is probable, however, that he will
hold to his present lines and make
no move to precipitate hostilities.
General Funston reported also the
Major Gray of the Fourteenth cavalry.
commanding the two troops attacked
by Mexicans at San Ignacio, Texas,
recently, had returned from an effort
to pick up the trail of the bandits. The
cavalry rode some distance down the
American side of the river, crossed to
the Mexican side on reports that a
bandit mobilization was in progress,
turned north again on the Mexican
side for several miles and recrossed it
to American territory without having
encountered any outlaws or finding a
trail.
Gets Carranza Oo-Operation?
Two additional prisoners were cap
tured on the American side and the
body of another dead. Mexican found
in the brush near the scene of the at
tack. Major Gray reported he had
received assurances of co-operation
from Carranza military commanders
across the line. The Mexican offi
cers said they had captured twenty
men believed to have been engaged in
the attack on the American camp.
The American commander said he
believed the band had been broken
up and that no further activities were
to be expected from that particular
force.

Despite demands made by a Meth

Frances Wilson, superintendent of the
Girls' Industrial school at Beloit, be
suspended awaiting a result of the in
vestigation of charges brought against
that institution by Beloit people, the
investigation will be carried on with
Miss Wilson in charge. Such was an an
nouncement made by Governor Cap
per this morning after issuing a state
ment that the investigating commit

Dr. Harding's Statement.
"The people of Beloit are clamoring
for her suspension while, the" investi
gation is in progress," said Dr. Eva
Harding of Topeka, who is interested
in the investigation. "The Rev. Mr.
Smith, a Methodist minister at Beloit,
and others, have demanded it."
Meantime, those who have pre
ferred the charges are delving into the
Kansas statutes and consulting attor
neys to ascertain whether the clipping
of a girl's hair and the shaving of her
head can be construed as mutilation of
the body. This is one of the charges
preferred. Other charges. Dr. Harding
stated, are:
The Charges.
Whipping girls.
Placing them in straight jackets.
Shackling girls.
Forcing them to work in the laun
dry while wearing shackles.
Making them sleep on a cement
floor while wearing shackles.
Miss Wilson, superintendent of the

tee are: Mrs. Lillian Mitchner, presi
dent of the W. C. T. U., Miss Lillian
Scott, former president of the State
Teachers' association, Baldwin; Mrs.
Katherine Hoffman, secretary of the

St. Louis, June 17. When the na
tional Democratic convention adjourn
ed sine die at 3:12 Friday afternoon,
three sharp dissensions had broken
the harmony that had hitherto pre
vailed. The first and second of these were
rows over the suffrage plank and the
plank relating to Mexico. The suf
frage fight was carried to the floor
of the convention. The pro-suffragists
of the convention won it. But their
plank, which provides for enfranchise
ment of women by states, fell short of
the hopes of the suffragists assem
bled here. A great meeting of protest
was held, presided over by Mrs. Car
rie Chapman Catt, and plans are al
ready under way for a fight against
the party at the November polls in the
suffrage states.
Mexican Plank Row.
The Mexican plank row occurred in
the committee on resolutions which
spent the entire night drafting the
platform. Governor Ferguson, of Tex
as, insisted savagely that the present
occupation of Mexico by American
troops constituted intervention. He
said it was folly to dodge the issue
and not demand intervention. But the
will of the president prevailed. There
was no demand for intervention In the
plank that came out of the committee.
The third and most rancorous row
took place in the national committee
and is still in full swing. Annoyed at
the president's naming of Vance Mc
Cormick, who is not a member of the
committee, as its chairman, the mem-
bcrs sputtered and protested all day

Laredo, June 17. Philip C. Hanna,
United States consul general at Mon

cans arrived here today. He was reti
cent as to the object of his visit.
Asked regarding conditions in Mex

"Everything is quiet down the line.
I may remain two or three days.
It has been known for some time
that Consul Hanna was instructed by
the state department that he could

discretion.
Consul Hanna immediately on his
arrival asked for an American news

San Antonio, June 17. The arrival
at Laredo today of Philip Hanna, con

the fact that the state department or
dered both him and J. R. Silliman,
consul at Saltillo, to the American
side of the river. The withdrawal of
these two consular officers will leave
the American government with no

ARMY TOO SMALL
Intervention in Mexico Will Re
quire 100,000 Soldiers.
Mexicans Are Veterans and Can
Select Own Ground.
Washington, June 17. An army,
staff officer, who cannot permit the
use of his name, made the following
stiten ent:
"The administration is evading for
a while general military intervention
in Mexico because the army is not
prepared to do intervention duty. It
is the conviction of military and dip
lonatie officers that nothing except
Aircrican soldiers can restore order in
that country.
"We had three years of actual ne
cessity for intervention, but we are not
ready. At best, we have about 40,
000 men. We will get a few more on
the first of the month, but they will
bs raw. Against this force there
would be pitted at least an equal num
ber of Mexicans.
"The Mexicans, however, would be
all veterans: they could choose their
own ground and defy our troops for
months while we were ordering men
to the border and seasoning the na
tional guard. Even then we should
have to wait for at least 100,000 vol
unteers. "The fault of the government is
that it has not utilized the past three
years in preparing an army that might
act at once when intervention, which
is admitted to be a necessity, becomes
a fact,"

Army Along Entire Border
Ready to Strike.
San Antonio, June 17. General
Funston and his staff gave careful at
tention today to the activities of out
law bands along the Mexican border,
but far greater interest was displayed
in the attitude assumed by the troops
of the defacto government.
General Parker at Brownsville, Tex.,
made a brief report early this morn
ing of the latest manifestation of out
lawry near San Benito and General
Mann reported the continuation of the
search for traces of the bandits who
raided the cavalry camp at San Igna
cio but It was evident at department
headquarters that greater significance
was attached to the doings of Car
ranza's troops than to those of the
bandit leaders.
General Ricaut's warning that the
crossing of the international boun
dary by any American troops for any
cause whatever wou'd be regarded as
an overt act by the United States and
would be the cause for an attack by
the de facto government troops did
not disturb General Funston or his
staff.
Will Cross Anyhow.
The search for bandits will continue
and whenever a "hot trail" is found
leading into Mexico the Americans
will not hesitate to follow it. The of
ficers in charge of troops on the bor
der have instructions that the cross
ing of the international line need not
be delayed by reports. They have the
authority to cross without waiting for
special instructions.- ----- r.
General Funston s army of almost
50,000 has been so disposed along the
Mexican border that swift punitive ac
tion could be taken if invited by any
over act of Carranza's army. Gen
eral Jacinto Trevino's threat to at
tack General Pershing if the American
troops move east or west or south wag
regarded by army officers here as lit
tle less than a declaration of hostilities
by the Mexicans, since it may be nec
essary at any time for the leader of
the big punitive expedition to send
small detachments in pursuit of out
law bands that may be menacing his
outposts.
No Fear For Pershing.
No fear is felt, however, that-General
Pershingywill not be able to take
care of himself. Precautions taken
by General JBell at El Paso last night
in holding' all the American trooos
ready for action were similar to those
taken at every border point opposite
which there was any considerable
number of Carranza troops. The
greatest activity was displayed at
Juarez because of the marked activity
