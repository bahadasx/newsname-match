M FIFTY MEN TO BE EMPLOYED AND FORTY TEAMS
HAULING ORE NEW BUILDINGS BEING ERECTED
M AND NEW MINE EQUIPMENT BEING INSTALLED.
!H All the ore teams were taken off the beginning of the week
jfl and no more ore will he sent down from the Pacific mine for
jl about ten days, till the mine is gotten in shape for operating on
jH a big scale, commensurate with the immense ore bodies eontain-
M cd in the property.
M The first tiling to be done
Ml will be the removal of the light
Ma S-pound rails and replace them
H with 10-)ound ones, so that the
m heavy cars may he run out
J without danger of their being
J run off the track.
H The Pacific fissure as it goes
H to the north contains several
H prominent faults making a
H number of shaj'p corners. All
H the men have been taken off
H the ore, and are now busy cut-
H ting these corners so as to re-
H duee the curves in the track.
H Mr. Carl Ferlin, the new
H manager, says that he will as
H soon as this work has been
H completed, put many more
Ha men to work on the mine
B and the ore extracted with
M nil posible speed, so as
M to get the ore to market while
m the metal prices are high. At
m the same time others will con-
B tinue )rospecting the big vein
M and it is likely that by the time
m siunmer is over, 50 men will be
H employed in the property, and
BJ it is not unlikely that forty
H terms will be busy hauling the
H ore to the railway.

the Inst ore to be broken will
be the Copper Glance ore near
the north end of the drift. Here
the slope is more than five feet
wide, and some who visited it
the past week say that this one
stope alone contains $100,000
worth of ore. It is of the class
samples of which assayed f12
ounces in silver and '215 per
cent lead. When this ore,
worth from $15,000 to $25,000
per car, commences coming to
the market, the mining world
will sit up and take notice of
American Fork Canyon.
Two more mine ears were sent
up to the Canyon this week,
as three or four cars will be
necessary to wheel the ore out
fast as it is broken down. Ord-(
ers were given for some new
bins to be erected at once in
which to place the ore, and Mr.
Ferlin has recommended that.
a small mill, capable of hand-,
ling at least 50 tons, be erected ,
at once.
Carpenters have commenced
the erection of a cottage for
the superintendent and wife,

BAY SrATE DEVELOPING

Three Shifts Pushing Lower Work

Of nil tho work being done In the
ennyon, nono Is being followed with
closer Interest than Goorgo Tyler's
dovclpomont of tho Hay Stntc piopor
ty. Kverybody seems to bo Interested
In Its pi ogress, nnd nonrly ovoryonn
acquainted with tho nature of the
woik being dono expects Mr. Tyler to
bring In n mlno, and demonstrate tho
mineral woith of that sido of tho enn
yon. The thousand or moro feet of tun
nels, drifts, winzes nnd up-rnlses mo
nearly all In oro bearing lime, show
ing jHimo of tho strongest mineraliza
tion in nil tho canyon. No othor
property enn show moio places with
ore, nnd whon tho writer visited it,
two men woro sacking ore, ono on an
olght Inch vein and tho other on
twelve inch streak. Sovcnty five
sacks of Jilgh grade oro, said to be
worth $125 per ton, woro on tho
dump.

point where mining experts say n

Tho contractors with two shifts were
making nbout two feet per day and
ono of them left Sunday for Hobor
City to got men to put on another
shift.
An interesting feature of tho Uny
Stato is tho quantity of antimony In
tho porphry djkc near tho surface. If
it grows i Ichor with depth It is nof
unlikely thnt the mining of antimony
may become a commercial feoturo of
tho mine. The liny Stato has somo of
tho biggest territory of any proper
ty In tho Canyon.
