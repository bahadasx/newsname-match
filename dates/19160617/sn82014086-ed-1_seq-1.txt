Battles southeast of Lutsk, between

Trial of William Orpet. J

Frank Lambert, ; mother ; of Marian
Lambert, the Lake Forest high school
girl, whose body was found in a snow
drift in Helm's Woods last February,
took the stand today in the trial of
William Orpet, the University of Wis
consin student who is charged with
the murder of the girl, a former
sweetheart.
Dressed in deep mourning, . Mrs.
Lambert told in low tones of her
daughter's sunny . disposition whiieh
she retained until the day of her
death. This testimony contradicted
statements made on the witness stand
by IMiss Josephine Davis ' Marian's
most intimate friend, who had testi
fied that the victim of the Helm's
Woods tragedy frequently was very
unhappy and several times threatened
self-destruction.
Miss Davis had stated under oath
that Marian wept on Feb. 6, at her
birthday party, three days before her
death, because Orpet had transferred
his affections to another girl.
'Mrs. Lambert asserted today that
the tears were, occasioned by the in
ability of another girl friend, Annie
Paulson, to spend the night with her.
"For many years, on birthdays, the
Klrls spent the night with each other,
but Annie had to break the- custom

ADMINISTRATION NOT
SWERVED BY THREATS.
Determined to: Continue Campaign
Against Mexican Bandits.
Washington, : June 1-6. There were
no indications here tonight that the
administration's determination to con
tinue the campaign against bandits in
Mexico . would be altered by General
Trevino's reported threat . to begin
hostilities if the American troops move
from their present positions . in any
direction except toward the border.
General Pershing's orders authorize
him 4o move in any direction le finds
necessary to his purposes. In the ab
sence of Secretary Baker, who is in
St. Louis, ' no official would . predict
whether these orders would be changed
but the general impression prevailed
that they would not toe.
There is no fear of an 'immediate
clash, however, for officials toelieve
General Pershing would avoid taking
any step - that might lead to serious
consequences until he had communi
cated with Washington. Late tonight
the war department had no word from
him or from any other source to con
firm the report of General Trevino's
action. . , ,
Recent troop movements in Chihua
hua state have led officials here to
fear that the de . facto commanders
were preparing for some hostile move.

Haste
There was a time In business w'hen it was deemed "clever" to get
a customer's money quickly and hurry him away.
Business was conducted on the principle that a "customer's eyes
were his market." If he made a mistake in selecting goods or was led
into buying an -inferior article there was no. redress.
The man or woman of today who finds a purchase is not satisfac
tory, or as represented, has . the purchase money refunded. The pro
gressive merchant has. found that it pays to give his customers time
and the widest latitude in making selections. If he hurries them, -or
they, make too hasty selection, his sales may not prove satisfactory.
Experience proves that the careful buyer is. usually the worth
while buyer, for careful people are usually; successful people. They
are the ones who know how to utilize their powers. They are
the owners of well-managed homes and the supporters of the reliable
newspaper which goes into those homes. - ., '

of the railroads united in the declara
tion that while the situation is seri
ous, it is not hopeless. The ballots
are to be delivered tomorrow and will
be taken b. ydelegates to their homes
for distribution to expedite the vote.
: Both Sides Hold Conferences. '
Both the railroad managers "and the
brotherhood leaders and delegates
held secret day-Ions conferences.
They discussed, it was learned,', poli
cies for . their future conduct - in the
negotiations 'expected to .follow the
return of a, strike vote. . ' .
-Brotherhood Leaders Confident. -
The brotherhood leaders are confi
dent that more than 85 per eent of 1
the men win vote in favor of a gen
eral strike which, however, - acording
to the wording of the ballot, cannot
be called until all efforts toward an
amicable adjustment of their differenc
es Have failed. -
Settlement Through Mediation.
Leaders of the railroads and the men
were -reluctant to issue- official state
ments today touching on the proba
bility of a compromise, but informal
Interviews indicated that both sides
looked for a settlement through medi
ation, under the Newlands" act. The
railroads, the employes believe, may
drop at the last moment their firm
stand for the elimination of "double
compensation - rules and consent to
arbitrate the questions of hours and
overtime.
May Compromise on Nine Hour Day.
Rather than precipitate a general
strike, brotherhood leaders intimated,
the men might be satisfied with a
nine hour day and time and a quarter
overtime, instead of the eight hour
day and time and a half for overtime
demands.
" . Situation Not Hopeless.
"The situation is not as hopeless aa
It . may seem at first glance" said A.
B. Garretson. president of the Broth'
erhood of Railroad Conductors, who
was spokesman for the men during the
conference. ' The public must not
lose sight of the fact that no counter
has. been offered by the railroads to
the demands of the men. It is im
possible for the brotherhoods to take
a decisive stand until the railroads
make their position clear. As the sit'
uation . stands now the brotherhoods
submitted their . demands to the rail
roads, and they were repected."
Vote to be Canvassed Late In June.
Most of the delegates will leave for
their homes tomorrow night. Within
a week the strike ballot. will be in the
hands of 370,000 brotherhood members
and more than 50,000 other workers
who are not members. The vote, the
leaders expect, will be canvassed late
In June, after they will return here.

Drowning the Din on the
sition Developed to the Plank on Americanism.
St. Louis. Mo- June 18. The demo
cratic national convention finished its
work today by adopting the party
platform exactly as approved . by
President Wilson and submitted by the
resolutions committee, including the
plank on Americanism and that favor
ing woman suffrage, but not until the
harmony of its three days' session, had
been disturbed with a . row over the
suffrage plank.
No Voice Against Americanism Plank.
No voice was raised against tkie vig
orous declarations of the Americanism
plank, but at one time it looked as if
the suffrage plank had been lost. Af
ter Senator Walsh of Montana had
told the convention that President
Wilson himself considered it vital to
party success, however, it was voted
into the platform by a ballot of 8S8 1-2
to 181 1-2. The entire platform then
was adopted without roll call.
Suffrage Plank as Adopted.
As It went into the platform ' the
eunrage pianK stands:
We favor -the extension of the fran
chise to the women of this country,
state by state, on liie same terms as
to tne men." -
The women suffrage leaders consid
ered it a much more favorable decla
ration than they got from the repub
llcan convention at Chicago: they
threw all their force behind it and won
the support of the administration lead
ers, who were found fighting for them
when danger threatened.
. Platform Makers Exhausted.
Haggard and worn from an all-night
session, tie platform makers were not
ready , with their report until after
noon, when-.Senator, Stone,.,: sleepless
for more than thirty' hours, ' took the
speakers stand and. explaininsr that
he, was - too tired- to' read . the docu
ment,' gave- over h!s"ta8k to Senator
Walsh of Montana and Senator Hollis
of New Hampshire.- They "spelled"
each other reading the long declara
tion. - - .-p.
Fight on Suffrage Plank.
The fight on Uie suffrage plank was
In the air. Everybody was keyed uj 1
to it and when at the conclusion of the
reading of the platform Martin Lomas
ney of soston, a delegate, claimed tne
attention of the chair, It was thought
he was opening: the fight, and It -was
several minutes before the shouts of
approval and cries of disapproval
could be stilled sufficiently to hear
that to wanted to put the convention
on record as sympathizing with "the
people of Ireland.
Raus nut blm!" roared a Baltimore
delegate. . - ' -
The real fight broke Immediately af
ter, however. When Governor Ferguson
of Texas, who headed - the minority
report . against the : administration
pianx, was given thirty . minutes in
which to present it. The plan offered
by the minority wast
Plan Offered by Minority.
"The democratic party always tias
stood for ths sovereignty of the several
states in the control and regulation -of
elections. We reaffirm the historic
position of our party in this regard
and favor the continuance of that wise
provision of the federal constitution
which vests In the' several states of
the union the power to prescribe the
qualifications of their electors.
Besides Governor Ferguson,' the re
port was signed by former Representa
tive J3artiett- 01 Georgia, James .
Nugent of New Jersey and Stephen B,
Fleming of Fort Wayne. Ind.
The burden of Governor Ferguson s
argument was tfaat suffrage, being
purely a state's right question, the
wording of the majority plank was a
presumptuous recommendation to the
states on how to conduct their elec
torates. -.
Anti-Suffrage Delegates Plied Que
, - tions.
Anti-suffrage delegates on the floor
plied the governor with questions and
brought out in the answers fresh ar
guments against the administration
plank. When Ferguson had finished
th econvention was in confusion and
the tone of the uproar' in the dele
gate section was indicative of sympa
thy with the opponents of the adminis
tration plank.
When Senator Stone took the speak
er's place, to defend the plank, he was
bombarded with a running fire of
questions and argument from dele
gates on the floor which eveatually
exhausted the time allotted to him
Without permitting him to speak ten
successive minutes. -
Anti-suffrage delegates loudly chal
lenger bis reference , to Ferguson's
statements with cries of That e not
what he said!" and "That's not fair!"
Many delegates openly took t:e posl
tion that the question was becoming
much confused by the manner of its
presentation. Finally Senator Stone
yielded to Senator Pittman of Nevada,
one 01 me sunrage cnampions.
Crowd Wanted to Howl Pittman Down.
The crowd wanted to howl Pittman
down, and cried "Vote! Vote!"
"Yes, I know you want to vote,"
Pittman shouted at his opponents.
"You'd rather do - anything else than
near the truth, '
"Are you men who are willing to
hear women denounced afraid to hear a
man say somethingr in ;iieir behalf?
want to appeal to you to . give your
sisters and daughters and mothers the
right to vote." -
"What's that got to do with this?"
cnerusea tne delegates.
Finally, ignoring lesser outbreaks
and shouting above the din and con
fusion, Pittman managed to get
through with his speech.

Walsh swept aside the smaller cupm

essential for party victory.
