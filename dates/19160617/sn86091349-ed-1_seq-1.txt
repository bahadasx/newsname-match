Pioneer Pincheite
Recalls
The Record is in receipt of a let
ter from Roy, Willis, a pioneer res
ident of Pioche, who is now a resi
dent of Westwood, Cal., and the fol
lowing extracts from his communica
tion may be of interest to the few
old-timers now here and who may re
member the writer. Mr. Willis writ
es: "I was one of the pioneers of Pi
oche and I would like to hear some
thing of the country where I spent
a number of my boyhood days.
"I hauled water from the High
land springs in barrels and peddled
it in buckets about camp. Later I
hauled ore from the Hermese, Pi
oche Nos. 1, 2 and 3, and Meadow
Valley over the Andy Fife road to
the Condor mill in the canyon above
Bullionville.
"If there are any of the old pio
neers of Austin, Treasure Hill, Ham
ilton and Pioche left, they will no
doubt remember the boy, 'Cap.' Wil
lis. I lived on Lacour street in the
early days of Pioche."
If Mr. Willis should come back to
Pioche now lie would find but few of
those sturdy old pioneers. Nearly all
have stepped to the other side. How
ever, he would fiind Charley Rodeen
and Ong Lung Chung, whom we all
know as Charley, and no doubt they
could spend many profitable hours
in recalling incidents of. the early 703
when Pioche was heralded every
where as one of the livliest mining
camps on the globe.
Mr. Willis would also recognize
some of the old land marks left by
the miners of his boyhood and a few
of the old rock business blocks with
their strong iron doors. But in
looking around the mines, he would
note a vast change; he would find
. none of th old hoisting plants
that were familar to him; neither
would he find any of the old reduc
tion works.' These have all disap
peared. The Condor mill was des
troyed by Are years ago and at Bul
lionville he would discover little to
recall old times, save perhaps a
few sections of the grade of the old
Pioche & Bullionville railroad.
At Bullionville, however, he would
see work work being rushed on a
new modern 200-ton mill, where oil
flotation will play an important part
in recovering the values left in near
ly 200 tons of mill tailings at Bul
lionville and Dry Valley.
In Pioche, he would find the splen
did new Consolidated Nevada-Utah
mill grinding out the values con
tained in the great mass of zinc
lead ores of the famous "Black
Ledge," which was too complex for
the metallurgists of of the 70s to
fathom. He would find the great
Prince Consolidated at the "old iron
blow-out," over on the west side of
the Ely range, which is sending out
600 tons of ore per day over its own
broad guaged railroad to Pioche.
The Prince has paid over $200,000
in dividends dug out of that "old
Iron blow-out" in the past year and
In that mine are ore reserves, which
the owners themselves do not know
to what enormous extent they exist-
Mr. Willis would find the Salt
Lake Route . built in here,' -which
carried out daring 1915, over 2200
cars of ore, while the prospects are
that it will exceed 3000 durin the
current year.. He would find the
Pioche Pacific narrow guaged line
to Jack Rabbit hauling ore from
Piinol and Jack Rabbit
Mr. Willis would not find the "red
hot" camp as of yore, when gamb
ling was run at high speed, when the
glare of the dance hall was an at
traction and when shooting scrapes
were as common as pancakes for
breakfast. Such conditions do not
exist here now; that Is all history
exist now. But when it comes down
to real mining, Pioche is yet in its
infancy.
UVADA COPPER TRAM
IN OPERATION AGAIN
Ore- shipping from the Uvada
Copper was handicapped last week
owing to the breaking of the tram
way cable . This has been repaired
and the Pioche Pacific trains have
run dally to Jack Rabbit this week
to carry In ore.

COWBOYS LASSO BIG
BLACK BEAK AT LUND
Joe Delmue- was at the Hotel Al
exander the first of the week, hav
ing just returned from Lund, where
he superintended the loading of
about 1500 head of cattle. The live
stock vas brought in mostly from
Kane county, Utah.
While in Lund on the morning of
the 10 inst. a genuine black bear
strolled into town and caused con
siderable excitement.
How' Mr. Bruin should so lose his
bearings as to stroll into a neigh
borhood where a bunch of cowboys
were working seems inexplicable;
but nevertheless he got there. Be
fore Bruin knew where he wa3 at he
v;as rounded up and roped secure
ly by the cow men. The captive was
placed in a hastily made cage and a
rope placed around his neck to pre
vent him from raising too much com
motion. The confinement was not to
Mr. Brin's liking though, so he pro
ceeded to settle matters right then
and there by choking himself to
death. When the captors went to
see how the captive was getting on
they found that Bruin had decided
that death was preferable to being
a friend of the cowboys. The ani
mal, Mr. Delmue says, weighed about
750 pounds.
STATE LAND OFFICE
DOEH BIG BUSINESS
Friday was a great big day in the
state land office. The receipts in cash
amounted to $55,000. About $53,000
of this was for final payments on
contracts for land in Washoe, Hum
boldt and Elkocounties by the Un
ion Land and Stock company of Re
no, and involves making of pat
ents, covering 50,000 acres of land
The money was received and turned
over to the school funds in the
state treasury Carson News.

Nomina
The Democratic national conven
tion, which convened at St. Louis
last .Wednesday, nominated Wood
row Wilson for president, and T. R.
Marshall, for vice-president of the
United States. It was the express
ed desire of President Wilson, made
known to the delegates direct from
the White House that Mr. Mar
shall be chosen as his running mate
again. This shutout all vice-presidential
booms that had been started.
, The keynote speech was deliver
ed by former Gov. Glynn of New
York, which was as follows:
St. Louis, Mo., June 14. Following
Is a condensed version of the address
delivered at the opening of the Demo
cratic national convention today by
Temporary Chairman Martin H.
Glynn, former governor of New York.
Gentlemen of the Convention: The
Democratic party, In this convention
assembled, meets to perform a duty,
not to itself but to the nation.
We have entered this hall as Demo
crats; we shall deliberate and act here
as Americans.
Disregarding the divisions that make
one man a Tory and another a Whig,
one man a Republican and another a
Democrat, Americans will cast aside
the tinsel of party emblems. '
From the great, nulsiuir heart of the
nation will come a patriot command
to crush partisanship and rebuke what
ever Is mean or blind.
And when, a century from now.
America's children come to read our
history, we pray God that the history
we are about to make may prove an
Inspiration to their loyalty.
In the attainment of this hone, the
utterance of this prayer we who gather
nere today have a responsibility that
sobers our emotions as it strengthens
our resolutions.
For two years the world has been
afire. That fire still burns, but thus
far the United States has held the
flame at bay.
Must Support Principles.
What the people of the United
States must determine through their
suffrage Is whether the principles that
have been asserted as our national pol
icy shall be indorsed or withdrawn.
' This is the paramount Issue.
For 200 years neutrality was a the
ory; America made it a fact. To win
this priceless right of neutralitv this
nation had to undergo a long and pain
iui struggle.
Where Is the American hardy enoueh
to challenge a policy so firmly fixed
in the nations traditions?
The president of the United States
stands today where stood the men who
made America and who saved Amer
ica and made American neutrality a
national creed.
If Washington was right, if Jeffer
son was right, if Hamilton was right.
If Lincoln was right, then the presi
dent of the United States is right
today; if the Republican leaders are
right then Lincoln was wrong and
Jefferson was wrong and Hamilton
was wrong and Washington was
wrong. .
In all the history of the world
there is no other national policy that
has justified itself so completely and
entirely as the American policy of
neutrality and Isolation from the quar
rels of European powers.
Neutral Rights Asserted.
No American who knows the facts
can honestly, oppose or criticise the
policy of neutrality which the present
Democratic administration has pur
sued. America's doctrine of neutrality
never meant that this nation must
rush headlong into war at the first
Invasion of Its neutral rights. This
does not mean that America will not
resort to war when all other means
of protecting its neutral rights have
failed, but it dpes mean that America
will exhaust every peaceful means of
protecting those rights before it takes
the step from which there is no ap
peal. The issue, raised by our opponents,
of the vigor with which our neutral
ity has been enforced is a compara
tive Issue which can be decided only
by comparative results.
When Grant was president, during
the war between Spain and the Span
ish West Indies, a Spanish gunboat
seized the vessel Virginius flying the
American . flag and a Spanish com
mandant In cold blood shot the cap
tain of the Virginius, 36 of the crew
and 16 of the passengers.
But we didn't go to war. Grant
settled our troubles by negotiation.
When Benjamin Harrison was
president the people of Chill, con
ceived a violent dislike to the United
States. One Junior officer, from the
JJj&Stf ri-:r5 arshiji Baltimore, wjj
tes Wilson
killed outright in the streets of Val
paraiso and 16 of our sailors bound
ed. Hut we didn't go to war. Harrison
ettled our troubles by negotiation.
More Historical Facts.
Whea Lincoln was president this
country's rights were violated on ev
ery tilde. England. Russia. France
anil Spain were guilty of flagrant vio
lations. But we didn't go to war. Lincoln
settled our troubles by negotiation.
.When Pierce was president the
British minister In this country and
three of his consuls violated our neu
trality during th Crimean war. We
gave these represenetatives of Great
Britain their passports arid sent them
borne. ,
But we didn't go to war. Pierce
ettled our troubles by negotiation.
When Van Buren wa3 president a
detachment of Canadian militia, dur
ing the Internal troubles in Canada,
boarded the U. S. ship Carolina in
the American waters of Niagara river,
killed an American member of the
crew, fired the ship and sent her
adrift over Niagara Falls
But we didn't go to war. . Van
Buren settled our troubles by nego
tiation. When Jefferson was president Eng
land seized hundreds of our ships and
Napolfon hundreds more.
But we didn't go to war. Jefferson
settled our troubles by negotiation.
When Adams was president France
preyed upon our commerce until she
had piled up in our state department
charges of over 2,300 violations of
neutrality's law.
But we didn't go to war. Adams
settled our troubles by negotiation.
When Washington was president
and, "neutrality" first declared, war
convulsed Europe. England and
France seized 400 of our ships and
confiscated millions of dollars' worth
of our property.
But we didn't go to war. Wash
ington settled our troubles by nego
tiation. In his policy of peaceful negotia
tions today the president of the Unit
ed States follows the example set htm
by the greatest presidents the Demo
cratic party and the greatest presi
dents the Republican party ever gave
this nation.
- Policy of Negotiation.
"To maintain our national honor by
peace if we can, by war If we must,"
is the motto of the president of the
United States.
But before submitting to the chance
and misery of war, true statesman
that he is, he proposes to put the rea
son and justice of negotiation to the
test.
But, say our critics, this policy sat
isfies no one.
They mean it does not satisfy those
who would map out a new and un
tried course for this nation to pursue,
Temporary Cnairman Glynn.
but they forget it does satisfy those
who believe the United States should
live up to the principles If has pro
fessed for a century and more.
National Honor.
In desperation for a slogan our op
ponents try to create an issue out ot
national honor.
Now national honor Is not the whim
of an individual mind.
National honor is the composite sen
timent, the composite reason of a
whole people feeling the emotions of
nature and following the dictates ot
God.

RK.0 WOMAN IS HONORED
AT CHICAGO CONVENTION
A Chicago dispatch under date of
the 8th inst brought thhe informa
tion that Mrs. T. F. Moran of Ueno
was the first woman to rwewe of
ficial recognition at a Repub'ican na
national convention. At a caucus of
Nevada delegates she was chosen an
a member of the committee to noti
fy the vice-presidential nomineo of
his selection by the convention.
The state delegation chose H. G.
Humphrey of Reno as national com
mitteeman to succeed Col. H. B.
Maxon, and named Samuel Piatt as
the Nevada member of the commit
tee on resolutions.
Manual Training Tools Here
The manual training equipment,
which has been provided for the
Pioche public schools through the
efforts of the ladies of the Parent
Teachers' association, has arrived
and will be installed by the board of
trustees before the opening of the
t ext term of school in September.
m ' ....
The Fourth, of July will be cele
brated in appropriate style in Pi
oche this year. A meeting of citi
zens has been called for tonight to
discuss plans and to appoint the var
ious committees. Every patriotic citi
zen should attend and help to make
this year's celebration the best ever
held here.
And It Is for this reason that "the
power" to declare war is conferred
by the Constitution of the United
States, not on the individual will ot
president, but on the composite rea
son, the representative decision ot
"the congress of the .United States."
The genius of this country is for
peace. There Is no danger of "mill,
tarism.
We have built our greatness on the
resources of nature and the peace
ful toil of our people.
With us war has never been a
choice, it has always been a fate.
Like the old Mohawk chief who
loved peace, we would like to throw
the tomahawk of war so high In the
sky that no man's hand could ever
pull it down. But when some other
tribe among the races ot men sends
us bundle of arrows wrapped In
the skin of a rattlesnake, we want to
be lir a position to send that rattle
snake's skin back stuffed with powder
and with ball. .
We " deprecate the compulsion but
we recognize the need of the police
man on the beat, the safe In the
bank and the watchdog on the farm.
Tbe war across the seas has
brought home to us the fear that so
long as men are men and nations na
tion!, wars will continue.
For these reasons this administra
tion has done more for our army and
our navy than any administration In
our history.
The Democratic party advocates and
seeks preparedness, but it is prepared
ness for defense, not preparedness
for aggression.
Our National Soul.
These, then, are the principles that
have been asserted and followed by
the president ot the United States
during the past two years that the
United States shall not embroil it
self In European strife, that the Unit
ed States shall endeavor to maintain
friendly and cordial relations with ev
ery other nation and that the United
States shall firmly assert and main
tain and be prepared to assert and
maintain Its neutral rights against
very belligerent.
This convention must make It plain
that all divisions among the Ameri
can people stop at the ocean's edge.'
Over and above every other reason
that the nation may have for uphold
ing its president, is the necessity ot
proving to the world that we ara
united people.

Reported Satisfactory
The Con. Nevada Utah mill ran
continuously all this week with the
loss of only four hours, which was
due to the breaking or an elevator
belt and the necessity or replacing
a new one.
The plant is producing a grade
of concentrate much better than any
of the sorted ore products shipped
in the past; the filter press ia hring
brlng the moisture to very low fig
ure.. During the week the plant has
been milling ore from the dumps
which runs high in metallic contents
considerably above the average feed.
In the No 1 shaft work was start
ed this week on a crosscut on the
1400 level southwest from the most
westerly point on the level; the idea
being to prospect south of the dyka
west of the Black Ledge winze.
Already the miners have cut three
or four stringers both zinc and lead
The indications, according to the
management, are not at all unfavor
able. In fact, they are decidedly en
couraging. The new cross-cut has brought In
a i'ttle more water which the p imps
.'an handle easily.
A new safety device Is being in
stalled under the shlve wheel. The
function of which is to sever the
cable from the cage in caaa ot an
overwind and at the same time to
hang the cage up. This additional
equipment makes the shaft safer
than in the past.
Taken In all and operations at
both mine and mill this week have
been very satisfactory.
