Wilson and Marshall Are
Named by Acclamation
Late at Night
St. Louis, June 16. —The democratic
national convention having by ,acclam
ation renominated President Woodrow
Wilson and Vice President Thomas R.
Marshall, met in final session today to
adopt its declaration of principles. The
committee on resolutions was not
ready to report when the convention at
midnight had completed the ticket, so
after listening to a number of speeches
a recess was taken until 11 a. m.
Many Empty Seat*.
At 11 o'clock, the hour for the final
session of the democratic national con
vention to begin, there were not more
than 200 delegates in the Coliseum and
the seats were filling slowly. The first
gallery rows were filled but there were
no crowds around the doors.
At 11:26 a. m. Chairman James call
ed the convention to order.
Prayer was offered by Rabbi Leon
Harrison of St. LOUIB, who gave thanks
for "the great leader of this nation,
wielding po strong arm of flesh and
yet triumphant in his invincible plea
for Justice and humanity." He gave
thanks for "the wise and noble presi
dent of the United States who has
warded off disaster, who with firm and
fearless hand has steered us between
the menace of both warfare and dis
honor, assuring the people peace with
out shame, a proud peace with head
erect and dignity undiminished."
There was a report that Gov. Fergu
son of Texas would present a minority
plank on Mexico. Leaders hoped to
head off a dissenting report.
Gov. Ferguson later, however, let it
be known he would present no dissent
ing plank.
Have Lots of Time.
Chairman Jame^ called for the re
port of the platform committee but It
was not ready and the convention set
tled down to wait
At 11:48 Chairman James announced
that the platform report would be
made In a few minutes.
In response to a request from dele
gates to fix the time and place for
notification of President Wilson and
Vice President Marshall of their re
nomination, Chairman James explain
ed that it was the plan to confer first
with the candidates.
Senator Reed of Missouri then made
a speech to fill in the time.
The burden of Reed's speech was an
attack on the nomination of Mr.
Hughes because he was taken from the
supreme court bench.
Reads Statement
Reed read a statement which he at
tributed to Mr. Hughes in 1912, which
declared against a supreme court jus
tice entering politics.
"Against Candidate Hughes in 1916
I quote Mr. Justice Hughes in 1912,"
he declared as he read the statement.
While Senator Reed was speaking.
Senator Stone, chairman of the plat
form committee, entered the hall and
although the platform had not yet
been presened to the convention he
authorized its immediate publication
because it had been published without
authority and In violation of pledges
of confidence in some parts of the
country.
"America" was played by the band
when Senator Reed concluded and
while Chairman Stone of the resolu
tions committee mounted the platform
to present the platform. Senator Stone
looked haggard and worn from his long
viglL
In introducing Senator Stone, Chair
man James asked for order "to hear
the democratic declaration of faith."
Senator Stone was given prolonged
applause.
Describing the committee's labors as
"somewhat protracted and arduous,"
Senator Stone made a brief introduc
tory address.
"I am not going to read," said he,
referring to the platform. "I have not
been able to sleep a moment in more
than thirty hours."
Begin Reading Platform.
Chairman Stone delegated the read
ing to Senator Walsh of Montana and
Senator Hollls of Montana. Senator
Walsh took the speaker's stand first
and began reading at 12:36 p. m.
The fii^st applause given the plat
form was for the endorsement of the
^.administration. The delegates gave
close attention.
Before Senator Walsh had finished
the preamble spectators in the galler
ies began to leave and the noise made
it difficult for delegates to hear.

COMMITTEE'S
REPORT INVOLVES
DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION HAS
PARTY'S PLATFORM COVERED
FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES.
St. Louis, June 16.—The resolutions
committee of the democratic conven
tion, after almost twenty-four hours of
deliberation, finished its draft of a plat
form shortly -after eight o'clock today
and authorized Senator Stone, its
chairman, to present the document to
the convention.
The committee began its final ses
sion at 11 o'clock last night and kept
at work continuously until the draft
was completed. Few changes wero
made in the tentative platform as
drawn by the subcommittee of nine
but the night was spent in discussion
of the phraseology of some of the
more important planks, especially
those on Americanism, woman suffrage
and Mexico.
Party leaders expressed belief thai
approval of the platform would be
given by the «onvention without much
discussion.
Americanism.
"The part that the United States
will play in the new day of interna
tional relationships which is now upon
us will depend upon our preparation
and our character. The democratic
party therefore, recognizes the asser
tion and triumphant demonstration of
the indivisibility and coherent strength
of nation therefore as supreme issue
of this day in which the whole world
faces the crisis of manifold change.
It summons all men, of whatever
origin of creed, who would count them
selves Americans, to join in making
clear to all the world the unity and
consequent power of America.
"This is an issue of patriotism. To
taint with partisanship would be to
defile it. In this day of test, America
must show itself, not a nation of
partisans, but a nation of patriots.
There is gathered here in America the
best of the blood, the industry and the
genius of the whole world, the ele
ments of a great race and a magnifi
cent society to be melted into a
mighty and splendid nation.
"Whoever, actuated by the purpose
to promote the interest of a foreign
power, in disregard of our own coun
try's welfare or to injure this govern
ment in its foreign relations or cripled
or destroy its industries at home and
whoever by arousing prejudices of a
racial, religious or other nature
creates discord and strife among our
people so as to obstruct the wholesome
process of unification, is faithless to
the trust which the privileges of citi
senship repose In him'and disloyal to
his country.
Condemn Cross Interests.
"We, therefore, condemn as sub
versive of this nation's unity and in
tegrity and as destructive- of its wel
fare, the activities and designs of
every group or organization, political
or otherwise, that has for its object
the advancement of the interest of a
foreign power, whether such object is
promoted by intimidating the govern
ment, a political party, or representa
tives of the people, or which is cal
culated and tends to divide our people
into antagonistic groups and thus to
destroy that complete agreement and
solidarity of the people and that unity
of sentiment and national purpose so
essential to the perpetuity of the na
tion and its free institution.
"We condemn all alliances and com
binations of individuals in this country
of whatever nationality or descent,
who agree and conspire together for
the purpose of embarrassing or weak
ening our government or of improperly
influencing or coercing our public rep
resentatives in dealing or negotiating
with any foreign power. We charga
that such conspiracies among a lim
ited number exist and have been in
stigated for the purpose of advancing
the interests of foreign countries to
the prejudice and detriment of our
own country. We condemn any politi
cal party which, In view of the activity
of such conspirators surrenders its in
tegrity or modifies its policy."

Waukegan, III., June 16.—The ex

a toxicologlst of international reputa-
Dr. Webster was the principal wit
ness at the trial yesterday and was
closely examined by attorney for both
sides in regard to the poison which
caused the death.of the girl. It is con
sidered an important point in the case
whether the poison was administered
in a liquid or powder form and it was
around this point that the questioning
poison was in a liquid form when ad
ministered.
A factor in the defense was brought
out when cross examination of Dr.
Webster was resumed. Attorney Ralph
Potter of the defense adduced that,
nearly thred months elapsed from the
finding of Marion's body, February 10
to May 5, when Marion's coat and oth
er garments were brought to Dr. Web
ster to have stains on them analyzed.
The coat, introduced in evidence yes
terday, showed three circular white
spots, the marks, witness said, of cy
anide of potassium.
"Who brought the garments to
you?" asked Mr. Potter.
"Fred Wenban, the undertaker, and
Fred King."
"Had you talked previously with At
torney Joslyn of the prosecution, with
reference to any spots?"
"I can't say whether Mr. JoBlyn was
present. State's Attorney Dady men
tioned them a day or so before the
garments were brought to me."
"And that was the first.you heard of
the spots?"
"Yes, I believe it was, although I
have a hazy recollection that Wenban
may have mentioned them a few days
previously."
