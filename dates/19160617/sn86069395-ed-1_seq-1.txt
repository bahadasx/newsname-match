ATTACK BORDER PATROL
Mexican General Warns Trou
ble May Follow Pursuit
of Bandits.
Laredo, Tex., June ' 16. Three
American soldiers were killed and' six
wounded as a result of the latest raid
on American territory by Mexicans
coming from the southern side of the
Rio Grande. No civilians were in
jured, as the raid, which, occurred
early yesterday morning, was prim
arily an attack on tho border patrol
at the little settlement of San Ygancio,
40 miles south of Laredo.
Although successful in a measure,
the raid was not wholly surprising to
the American guard, which, in larger
numbers than the Mexicans expected
to find, saw in bright moonlight the
approach . of the 100 or more bandits
to the rear of where troop M of the
Fourteenth cavalry was encamped
and where troop 1 was but a short
distance awav. Both were under
command of Mai.1 Alonzo Gray.
The Mexican toll was last reported
as eight known dead, a number wound
ed and several captured. In addition,
42 horses were captured. One Mexi
can who surrendered is said to have
declared that he was forced into the
raid and that his sentiments were not
anti-American.
. The Mexicans expected to find only
a small detachment of American troops
at that point, according to the prison
ers. They attacked troop M, encamp
ed near the town, firing first at the
sentry. Troop I, a few hundred yards
up the river, rushed to the scene and
after the firing had lasted half an
hour the Mexicans retreated to the
south along the American side of the
Rio Grande with the Americans in
pursuit.
One thousand Carranza soldiers or
dered to the border some days ago to
reinforce the Carranza border patrol,
are somewhere south of San Ygnacio,
Texas, and should there be a third
American punitive expedition in Mex
ico, the two bodies of troops would
clash, according to Gen. Alfredo Ric-
ault, commander at Matamoros. Gen.
Ricault last night notified American
Consul Johnson of the position of
these men and the information was
conveyed to Gen. James Parker, com
manding lhe Brownville district.

Petrograd Asserts No Sign of
Slackening Up on 12th
Day of Battle.
EXAMPLE FOR BRITISH
There Is No Sign Yet of a
Drive on The West
Front.
London, June 16. The twelfth day
of the great Russian offensive against
the Austro-Hungarinns and Germans
from Volhynia to Bukowina shovs
nowhere any signs of slackening. jAU
along the front, fresh gains for the
Russian troops and the capture of
thousands of additional prisoners and
of guns, machine guns and war sup
plies are claimed by the Russians.
The amount of prisoners now exceeds
150,000. .
While semi-officia., advices from
Petrograd give a report that the Aus-
trinns have evacuated Czernowifz,
capital of Bukowina. the latest official
communication from Austrian head
quarters say the troops of Emperor
Francis Joseph are making a stand
north and east of the city, and at both
points have repulsed Russian attacks.
In the drive westward from the re
gion of Lutsk the Austrians are counter-attacking
or entrenching them
selves in new positions for a stand
against the Russians.
In Galicia near Tarnopol there is
still a deadlock between the Russians
and the Austrians and Germans.
On the German end of the northern
front in Russia, the Russians near
BaravP vichi attacked and carried Ger
manjvenches, but later were forced
to g?e them up. Infantry attacks by
thejpermans have occurred along the
Dvma river and in the lake region
south of Dvinsk but were repulsed,
according to Petrograd. The French
on the slopes south of Le Mont H' r-.i-
me, northwest of Verdun hau at
tacked ami captured a German trnuh.
Only artillery activity is in pro;.rc s
on the remainder of the frr. in
France and Belg'um.
