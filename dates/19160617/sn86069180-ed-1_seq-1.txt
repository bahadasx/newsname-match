REFLECTS GENERAL SENTIMENT
The following account In the
New York piess tells of the
memorial meeting held In New York
City Saturday evening, simultane
ously with like meetings. throughout
the country, and reflects the popular
sentiment throughout the United
States against England and Its
methods:
The walls of Madison Square Gar
den, If they have ears, have heard
many mighty choruses of cheering
in their venerable years of six-day
races and big-time prizefights. But
they have never heard louder cheers
than were brought forth last night
as W. Bourke Cockran and other
Irish-Americans denounced England
for killing Ireland's new martyrs
the "Sixteen of '1C."
That much it is safe to say, for
more than ten thousand Irishmen
and Irish women as many as ever
have been crowded into the gar
den for any qne event were there
for the Irish memorial maBs meet
ing, and they brought their voices
with them. Not more than half of
those who appeared at the garden
entrance were able to get in, and
by 7:30 o'clock, half an hour before
the meeting was scheduled to start,
the police reserves had ordered that
no more persons should be admitted
into tne garaen ine uioubunus w.,
were d sappolnted had to be con-1
tent with two open-air meetings ,
held in Madison avenue. I
They did more tnan lenu u eir
voices to the demonstration. They
gave their money with reckless
abandon to help the widows and
children of the sixteen who died for
Ireland. How much they gave will
not be known until there has been
"htno to count up, hut a hundred
baskets piled high with green and
veliow money indicated it was a
foitune,
The green and yellow In tha
baskets reflected the keynote of the
special decorations In which the gar
den waa dressed. Overhead a suy
of green hid the crossbeams. From
balconies and galleries and boxes
were draped the green, white and
yellow colors of the flag of the
short-lived "Irish Republic," while
swung high at the east end of the
arena was an actual battle flag of
he "republic" the same one which
floated over the Dublin Postofllce
during the recent revolt.
The meeting was one long cheer,
every mention of Ireland or Ger
many or the United States being
greeted with great demonstrations.
Hisses and boos greeted the men
tion of Great Britain, while the
namo of France was received 1 1
silence. The names of Lafayette
and Rochamheau were cheered, but
the volume of the tribute was as
nothing compared to that which
greeted the name of Von Steuben,
the Prussian General who fought
under Washington
Thousands of dollars were con-;
Hhntort tn tho Irish Relief Fund.
and late last night those In charge
of the meeting were still counting
iiii mnnov. The sneakers, all of
whom denounced English rule in .
Ireland as tyrannical and oppres-
alve, were- W. Bourk-J Cockran.
Congressman Jonn J. 1'iizgeraia,
ot Brooklyn; the Rev. A. A. Bene,
of Cambridge, Mass., and Jeremiah

zation known as th.9 American
Truth Society. Supreme Court
Justice Peter A. Hendilck p.v
slded, while Wilton Uackf.ye, thj
actor, was master of crev.onles.
Inside the garden all waB green.
Green cloths completely hid tu
ceilings. IriBh flags fluttered every
where, while nearly all present wore
green canatlons. The American
flag was also much in evidence.
In- opening the meeting Justice
Hendrick said that the meeting had
been called to express tho sym
pathy of American citizens for the
"heroes of Ireland, the victims of
an oppressive and tyrannical gov
ernment in their struggle for na
tional independence." He referred
to what he called the "Engllsh-
, American press of New York,"
which according to his way of
looking at things has been re
ferring to the iristi as "nypnen
ales." "There Is no such a thing as a
hyphenated Irishman in America,"
he added, and the crowd yelled and
waved their flags for half a minute,
when he declared that America has
no more loyal citizens than those
of Irish birth or extraction. He
linked the name of .Patrick" Pearse,
Lhe executed President of the Irish
Republic, with that of Emmet, and
said that the name of Pearse and
his fellow-revolutionists would live
forever in Irish history.
The Rev, Dr. Berle followed Jus
tice Hendrick and got the crowd
worked up when he mad the
Riatement that he bad reason to
believe that a movement was un
der way to form a British-American
alliance tffter the close of the
Buropean war. He declared that

The following from Brann's
Iconoclast will' prove interesting
reading for many who are unac
quainted with Ireland and her
troubles, which have existed for
hundreds of years because of Eng
lish misrule:
Tho failure ot the Irish rebellion
and the tragic fate of the ('Irish
leaders call vividly to mind A pic
ture of what might have hapened
had the American revolution failed.
The Irish rebellion failed, fnerefore
the men who fought) for the freedom
of their country are traitors. The
American Revolution did not fall,
therefore Washington and his men
were patriots. The difference be
tween patriot and traitor is often
merely the difference between suc
cess and failure. There is a differ
ence, however, between the position
of our Revolutionary heroes and the
Sinn Felners. The men who signed
the Declaration of . Independence
were really subjects of '.Great Britain
nnd practically ajl oil them ac
knowledged George as their lawful
sovereign. What then objected to
was not English rule, vbut English
misrule and lack of representation
They rebelled against I their
ac-
I nowledged government
because .
! was despotic.
ThA mon wim HlenodlMin nmcln-1
mntlon establishing the short-lived'
Irish Renuhllc had never ac -
knowledged that England had any
right to rule Ireland. They did
not consider themselves subjects of
Great Britain. Thev were out and
ut enemies of English rule In Ire
lnnd and made no effort to hide the
fnct that they were simply await
ing the proper opportunity to take
up arms against a government
which they considered a usurper.
The American patriots who fought
fnr ti..iRnonir.npA werp. rebels In the
real sense of the word. They had
been loyal citizens. They rebelled
against their government because it
was tyrannical, not because they
denied that England had any right
to rule In America. The Irish
fought not as rebels but as patriots
against an invader who had con
quered their country. They nev,er
admitted for a moment that Eng
land had the shadow of a right to
govern them.. "
God knows there has been
enough Injustice nnd oppression in
the British rule of Ireland to have
justified rebellion even if that rule
had not been established by con
quest against tho consent of the
people. For every reason that
caused the American patriots to
rebel against England there are
ten thousand' reasons why Irish pa
triots should do tho same thing
for the Emerald Isle. For every
tyranny practiced by England in
America previous to the war of
1 77G thero have been ten thousand
ach a thousand time3 worse In
'reland.
The Irishmen executed by EnK-
and were not adventurers ngntin
"or sordid gold as some would have
t believe. They were patriots of
he highest type, men willing to go
o sure death for tha liberty of
their native land. Tliey were made
of the same heroic stuff which' wa3
In the noble Americans who founded
this republic. Thomas McDonagh,
who was executed as one of the
signers of the Irish proclamation,
was a poet of no little merit. He
published several books, one of
which contains a poem about Irish
heroes. His life and his death are
In full accord with the spirit of his
writings:
"Let Erin remember the heroes
brave,
And gild their names in her
story,
Who nobly died their land to save,
When knaves forgot her glory."
The Irish rebellion failed .because
sufficient preparation had not been
made, England was in a position to
send unlimited numbers of troops
to put down the uprising, and many
Irishmen did not respond to the
call of patriotism. Tho utter fail
ure of the rebellion is almost proof
positive that Germany had little or
nothing to do with, the movement.
She probably did try to land some
munitions, but had tho affair been
planned by the German general
staff the chances are that England
would have experienced great diffi
culty In handling the situation.
HAPPY HEATH.
Sister Walburge Simpson, of the
Sisters of Nazareth, died somewhat
unexpectedly at Henderson last
Saturday, having received the sac
raments of the departing that day.
Her health was not good for a long
time, nevertheless she continued
her work fatlhfully to the end, for
she taught to dismissal time on
Friday ,and died at 1:15 the next
afternoon. The fatal attack lasted
two or three hours, during which
she was suriounded by the Sisters
and two physicians, who labored
faithfully to the end. She did not
die on the operating table as some
Louisville papers said. Sister Wal
burge, as became a follower of St.
Vincent do Paul, was of a notably
childlike disposition. Kind, help
ful and unassuming, sho aspired
onl to advance her pupils; sho
loved them and therefore was a
successful teacher. This was the
first death among the Sisters at
Henderson, although they have
been there foity-four years. It
caused a shock In the Holy Name
parish and one was prepared for
the concourse of parents and pupils
who attended mass for her repose
I on Monday. Sister Walburge, who
, was oorn in union county, tinny
eight years ago, was about twenty
years In the Sisterhood of Naz
areth. Sho taught In many places
and was burled at Nazareth.

Progressives Not Very Enthusi
astic Over the Selection of
Hughes'.
Before Being Muzzled Herald
Expressed Typical Attidudc
of Mooscrs.
GOV. GLYNN'S HASTERLYADDRESS
With the nomination of Wilson
and Marshall the campaign is now
on in earnest and the average voter
will have his fill of campaign
documents and arguments from now
Until November. While tho Repub
licans claim they aie satisfied with
Hughes as their candidate, never
theless he has no brought tho
Bull Moosers back into camp as
they had expected, but Instead the
latter aie skulking In their tents, be
coming more angry with them
selves than with Roosevelt. Only
last week it was said in these col
umns that It was only a question
of a short time that Teddy would
follow in the footsteps of William
Jennings Bryan to the down-and-out
realm of politics, and it came
true quicker than expected. As
stated above, the Bull Moosers are
sorer at themselves than at Roose
velt because they now realize how
he has used and buncoed them for
persorial benefit, and they aro
hardly in a mood to accept his ad
vice in supporting Hughes. It is
more than likely that they will
Becure some revenge by supporting
the Democratic party just to spite
Roosevelt Jf nothing else. The Pro
gressives as a rule have been an
emotional set and they c.an hardly
be expected to enthtise over the
Sphinx-like Hughes, he having none
of the charm of their former idol,
the1 Rough Rider.
Of course some of tho Progres
sives have already declared their
fealty to the Republican nominee,
being forced to do so in some in
stances, the course of the Louisville
Herald being an example. On last
Saturday, the day of the nomina
tion of Hughes, the Herald, speak
ing of Hughes, says: "Are -wcr to
choose a dumb man, an unk'n'tWH,"
a sphinx?" Again the Herald
said: "It will be hard, very hard,
to pretend that Mr. Justice Hughes
is the heaven-sent savior. It is
true that he has called the flag
beautiful. 'Tis a pretty Bentiment,
but it will hardly serve to steer
by." Now for the lighting-like,
change. Wednesday morning the
Herald reproduces on Its first pago
the appeal of its syndicate owner,
John C. Shaffer to Roosevelt, ask
ing him to support Hughes and de
cline the Progressive nomination.
The Herald owner says: "Justice
Hughes, who embodies in his per
sonality and in his public state
ment exactly the same spirit for
Americanism and preparedness as
you (Roosevelt) have voiced." It is
believed that the averago Bull
Mooser Indorses more the senti
ment of the Herald's local editor
when he said that Hughes' expres
sions "would hardly serve to steer
by." Again tho average Progres
sive is not placed in tho samo
situation as the Herald local edi
tor forced to support the Republi
can nominee.
There was more real enthusiasm
at the Democratic convention In St.
Louis this week than, could be ex
pected, when It is taken into con
sideration that there was no con
test on for tho nominations. It
Is believed that this is due in a
measure to the masterly address of
ex-Gov. Martin Glynn,' Temporary
Chairman, his review of the course
of past administrations in times of
stress being particularly strong,
while his ringing talk on American
ism had the real flavor and did
not smack of the jingo styles we
have been pestered with lately, the
kind you would expect to hear
at Hickory Corners on the Fourth
of July. His explanation of the
Wilson policy was the best defense
of the President's course yet heard.
Many Democrats have not agreed
with Wilson's policy in the Euro
pean war, believing he allowed
England too much latitude while
unnecessarily severe with Germany
but hardly "anyone could agree with
his Mexican policy in bargaining
with cut-throats and bandits of the
Vllla-Carranza tribe, and latest do-
velopments show that he will bo v
compelled to take the course he
should have taken long ago
repudiate Carrahza and if neces
sary intervene in Mexico.
Local Democrats aro satisfied
with the situation from their
standpoint, as they believe there is
still an impassable breach in the
G. O. P. between the regulars and
recent Bull Moosers. Tho refusal
of C. W. White, the Progressive
leader, to enter the Republican
primary proves thjs, as it is
believed that the Old Guard in the
G. O. P. are not extending the1
hand of welcome to their erring
brothers. It is believed that the
local Progressives will knife the
Republican nominee for Congress,
Prosecuting Attorney and State
Senator this year, and the Repub
licans will retaliate next year by
not evea allowing the Bull
Moosers a peep in at the primary
nominations. The real i'rogressive
leaders here have burned their
bridges behind them as far aa the
Republican party la concerned and
it would not be surprising to see
them lining up with Democracy in
local elections.
