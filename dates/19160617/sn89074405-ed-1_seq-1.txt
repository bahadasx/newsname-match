ANSWER MADE
BY CHANCELLOR
Head of German Govern
ment Defends Conduct
'U Before Reichstag.
New York, June. 17.—Dr. von Beth
mann-Hollweg, the German imperial
chancellor, in his speech In the Reich
stag June 5 regarding peace, was
quoted in the dispatches sent out from

charges that he was "the cause of the
worl/| catastrophe."
In the version of the speech as
transmitted by wireless telegraph to

tempting to reach an agreement with
Great Britain prior to the outbreak of
the war.
.. In the first report of the Reichstag
address after declaring that he knew
his attempt at an understanding with
Great Britain "was his'capital of
fense," is quoted as saying.
"I made this attempt in the face of
the development of an Bnglihs policy
which was hostile to Germany and of
which I was entirely cognisant. I am
not. ashamed of my conduct, even
though it proved abortive. He who on
that account .charges me with being
the cause of the world catastrophe,
with its hecatombs of human saerl
flees, may make his accusation before
God. I shall await God's judgment
calmly."
The Overseas News agency, how:
ever, in this regard quotes the ohan
cellor as saying:
"I made this att*mpt:«a am not
ashamed of It even if it. tailed. Who
soever considers this a crime, after
having witnessed for nearly two years
this 'world catastrophe With its heca
tombs, with its liuman sacrifices,
whosoever reproaches me for these at
tempts, may answ«r for hls attitude
before God. I awalt my judgment with
calmness."

against 300 that composed the com

great many members of the crews
were mobilized. This year 8,000 of
these mobilised men have been given
