PUBLIC LANDS GOOD ROADS.
Congressman Carl Hayden has
recently introduced a bill in the
House of Representatives which
if it becomes a law will be of no
little benetit to the state in vari
ous ways. The revenue from
the sale of one million acres of
land, applied to the building of
roads throughout the state will
add very materially to the road
system of Arizona. The possi
bility of selling tracts of six sec
tions ff land in one body will be
of great advantage in disposing
of grazing land, as areas of this
size will have some value to cat
tlegrowers, while the smaller
bodies of land, as a grazing pro
position, have little value. The
text of the bill follows:
A BII..L,
Granting public lands to the
State of Arizona for the con
struction, repair, and mainten
ance of public roads and high
ways. Be it enacted by the Senate
and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in
Congress assembled.
That there is hereby granted
and conveyed to the State of
Arizona, one million acres of un
reserved, nonmineral, surveyed
public lands lying within said
state, the proceeds of the sales
of which shall be used solely for
the purpose of constructing, re
pairing, and maintaining public
roads and highways.
Sec. 2. That said lands shall
be selected under the authority
and direction of the State land
department of said State within
three years after the passage
and approval of this Act, and
the Secretary of the Interior is
hereby authorized and directed
to issie patents to the State of
Arizona as soon as the selection
or designation thereof has been
certified to him by the governor
of said State, the designation to
be maae by legal subdivision of
the piublic land surveys.
Secv 3. That the lands herein
granted shall be sold after is
suance of patent, by the proper
authorities of said State, at not
less than S3 per acre and not in
greater area than six sections or
three thousand eight hundred
and forty acres to any one indi
vidual association, or corpora
tion, and under such rules and
regulations for the disposition
thereof as may be provided by
the legislature of the State of
Arizona.
RECRUITING BATTERY.
Fred Wright was here Thurs
day endeavoring to get recruits
for a machine gun company to
be attached to the First Arizona
infantry now on the border.
The company will comprise 52
men with a battery of Maxim
rapid fire machine guns. These
guns are of the latest design,
using the improved belt system,
and unlike the machine gun in
use at the time of the Columbus
raid, will not clog. They have
a maximum fire of 620 shots per
minute.
The company is being organiz
ed under the new army bill
which became effective when
President Wilson signed that
bill on the 3rd of this month.
Mr. Wright will be the first
lieutenant of the company and
it is expected that a regular
army officer will be placed in
command of the battery of rapid
fire guns. Several ex soldiers
have re enlisted in the company
and by reason of their past ex
periences will be 'placed in
charge of the guns as operators
of these destructive implements
of war. Florence Blade.

MIAMI MOTHER LODE.
Stock Will Soon Be Listed on the New
York Curb.
The stockholders of the Miami
Mother Lode Mining Company
recently held a special meeting,
and resolved to increase the
capital stock of the company
from 300,000 to 5,000,000 shares,
par value $1.00, 2,000,000 shares
to be set aside for the purpose
of accepting options on sur
rounding property and 3,000,000
to be put into the treasury for
the developing of properties.
The properties now held under
option and to be taken over by
the Miami Mother Lode are the
Five Points group of claims 280
acres; the Wm. Schater group
of 280 acres and the Mother
Lode Extension of 400 acres.
Active development of the
property will be inaugurated im
mediately to open up the ore
bodies on 90 and 140 foot levels
of the Five Points divisions.
Managing Director Wm. Schafer
and Chief Engineer L. M. Green
stein are busily engaged in pre
paring maps and complete re
ports preparatory to the listing
of the stock on the New York
curb.
The company owns 1140 acres
of mineralized granite and gran
ite porphyry adjacent to the big
producers of the Miami district
in Arizona, located in a hereto
fore neglected section. The min
eralized area shows fissure veins
traceable on the surface by iron
and quartz outcrops. The por
tion of the property now under
development carries three ledges
all prospected to a depth of 140
feet. A cross cut on the 90 dis
closes ten inches of chalcocite
assaying 30 per cent copper and
16 feet of milling ore carrying 3
to 6 per cent copper and 6 ounces
of silver. The formation re
sembles in many respects the
Butte district and has been
favorably reported on by mining
engineers of prominence.
The company plans to ship
the high grade ore and block
out the low grade until such ton
nage in sight siall warrant the
construction of a concentrator.
W. C. Budge As a Good Citizen.
Rev. G. C. Gouldin in referr
ing to the death of W. C. Budge
in Sunday's address said in part
as follows:
"To one who has spent the
better part of a short ministry
in parishes where the past and
not the future was the Golden
Age of the church, it is hard to
realize how a parish as young as
St. Andrew's can have a history.
In a very new and a much
changing diocese, people usual
ly labor for a short time and
move on. leaving their place
and work to be taken by another.
Thus, in the midst of the activ
ities of life, their memory is soon
blotted out,
"But the service yesterday
paihfully tells us that the his
tory of the Church of Arizona
is not unique. The young church
grows up, firmly and securely
built on the lives and examples
of those who serve faithfully
and die in harness.
"Thechurch has lost as sincere
communicant, the vestry mourn
their warden, the family of this
very small parish has experienc
ed the truth of Longfellow's
lines:
" 'There is no fire side, howso
ever defended,
But has one vacant chair."
"Mr. Budge was the first
member of this parish that I
learned to call by name. He
met me when I arrived and his
welcome was the fore runner of
many more that it has been my
good fortune to find here. Dur
ing the months that I have
known him and, alas! they have
been few I ever found him one
whose advice was invaluable
and one whose support was
ready and sincere.
"He was no, he is, for since
the first Easter we refuse to
acknowledge the reality of death
he is the personality that
makes for a good foundation in
the Master's church. He read
much and the wisdom he gained
thereby became, like the loaves
and fish, food for his fellow-man.
His service to his city made his
influence far reaching and his
stand for churchmanship meant
much in a community where
many are prone to forget their
early training until the hour
when trouble or adversity lays on
them a chilling hand.
"While we mourn, we also
thank God for such a fellow
parishioner and we pledge our
selves anevv to the work for
which our church stands, both
within these doors and in the
wider world. We well may ask
a share in his integrity, in his
sincerity, in his unselfiishness
and in his sterling strength of
character."

Church, Whitsunday, June 11th,

Reprieve for One; One Commuted.
At a meeting of the state
board of pardons and paroles
held at the state prison on Wed
nesday June 7th, at which time
the cases of N. V. Chavez, Mi
guel Peralta and Eduardo Perez
condemned to hang on Friday
the 9th instant, were under con
sideration, and following is the
action taken by the board:
Florence, Ariz., June 7, 1916.
At a meeting of the Board of
Pardons and Paroles held on
the above date at the Arizona
State Prison, the Board had un
der consideration the application
of N.V. Chavez, Serial No. 3479;
Miguel Peralta, Serial No. 3814,
Eduardo Perez, Serial No. 3480
for commutation of their sen
tences from hanging on June
9th, 1916, to imprisonment for
life in the Arizona State Prison.
Final action was taken as fol
lows: In the matter of the sentence
of N. V. Chavez, the board had
no recommendation to make that
will interfere with the sentence
of the court.
On the representation of the
warden that there was not facili
ties for executing more than one
prisoner on one date, the board
recommends to the Governor of
Arizona that a reprieve be grant
ed to Miguel Peralta until July
7th, 1916.
For sufficient reasons which
have been presented to the
board, the board recommends to
the Governor of Arizona that
the sentence of Eduardo Perez
be commutted to one of imprison
ment for life in the Arizona State
Prison.
Respectfully submitted.
