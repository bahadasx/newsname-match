SEASON FOR

In Blacksmith Fork canyon. It la said
thero wero a great many fishermen,

Rock creek and horn many resorted
to tho turning of tho stream in places
In order to catch tho fish with tholr
hands. Thoso who tried to get them
tho old way .with a fish-hook and lino
didn't succeed very well. Tho water
Is altogether too high for good fish
