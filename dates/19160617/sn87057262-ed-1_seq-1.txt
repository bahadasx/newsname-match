WASHINGTON, June 17.—Official
fconflrmatlon of denial of reports that
Seneral Trevino had warned General
Pershing against making "overt"
troop movements, was anxiously
awaited by administration officials to
day.
i'he government's note refusing
Carranca's last request for with
drawal of American forces, was Jjeld
up pending a report from Pershing.
If the report is true, Trevino's warn
ing will be dealt with in the reply,
it was stated "on high authority to

ranza is reported to have established
the present location of the American
punitive expedition as a "dead line."
Reports that his commander of the
north. General Jacinto Trevino, had
informed General Pershing any ad
vance from the present American
lines would constitute an act of war,
were not unexpected here. Authori
ties pointed to growing evidences of
Carranza's hostility to the expedi

EJ1 Paso's restlessness over the
Mexican situation was increased to
day without street car traffic to
Juarez and without the usual protec
tion of several companies of regular
Infantry who were ordered back to
their quarters at Fort Bliss.
Three Reported Killed.
BROWNSVILLE, Texas, June 17.—
Three Mexicans are reported to have,
been killed in a clash with United

Ultimatum to Pershing.
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, June 17.—
General Funston has received no con
firmation of the report that General
Trevino, Carranza commander in
northern Mexico, has issued a veri
table ultimatum to General Pershing,
warning him that any movement of
American troops to the east, south or
west of their present lines would be
the signal for actual hostilities.
No comment was forth-coming from
Funston concerning Major Gray's re
port that he crossed the Rio Grande
late yesterday in search of bandits
who raided San Ignacio, Thursday.
Gray said he was in Mexican terri
tory two hours but found no trace )f
the bandits. The crossing was made
between San Ignacio and Zapata.
The total known Mexican dead in
the raid was brought to nine by the
finding of another body on the Ameri
can side. Three bandits were cap
tured near the scene last night.
Figures compiled in army head
quarters here today show that thirty
American soldiers havy been killed
and more than 100 wounded by Mexi

LONDON, June 17—That the Aus
trlans, driven back from their first
line of trenches on the eastern front,
have settled into new positions of
strength and are stubbornly resist
ing the Russian advance is the con
clusion gained here from the fact that
the Russian official report does not
carry statements of tremendous terri
torial gains as in the first several
days of the drive. The capture of
Czernowitz, capital of Bukowtna, is
not yet officially confirmed, though
reported unofficially from several
sources. Its capture has not been de
nied from Vienna.
From a few miles north of Tarnopol
to Brody, the Austrians have held
their grounds steadily, due, says Pet
rograd, to the fact that the greatest
violence of the Russian drive has
been developed north and south of
this sector.
The drive already has had the
effect of lessening in marked degree
the Austrian pressure against the
Italians on the Trentino front. King
Victor Emmanuel of Italy has con
gratulated the czar on the success of
the" offensive.

was not surprised, for much of the
week's work in New York has been
devoted to a tunnelling process where
by sooner or later, Hughes and Ool

Those close to Hughes say such a
meeting will not occur before the no

the two may have a "mental" get-to

Hughes undoubtedly intends such a
"blast" in his forthcoming acceptance
of the nomination that Roosevelt can
well afford to come out openly in
his support, republican leaders say.
The republican campaign shaped
up today about thus:
Hughes has control.
He apparently will take little or

He has Inspired leaders all over

He has an organization already at

OF THE ORPET CASE

Orpet would not be introduced In
evidence.
Dady needed her testimony to es

do away with Marian.
Judge Donnelly was to rule today
on the admissability of evidence by
Percy Longland, an assistant to E. O.
Orpet, father of the defendant on the
Kuppenheimer estate at Lake Forest.
Longland is to bt a witness
for the defense, but Dady has de
manded that he be produced as
state's witness to testify regarding a
quantity of cyanide of potassium de
stroyed on the Kuppenheimer estate
a few days after Marian's death.
This cyanide, the state contended,
was destroyed at the elder Orpet's or
ders.
The state was about through with
its "chemistry class" today. All of the
expert testimony, tending to show
that cyanide in a liquid form caused
Marian's death, has been concluded.
Dady planned to wage his efforts
