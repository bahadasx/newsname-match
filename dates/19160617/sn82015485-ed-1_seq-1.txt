Hays Inflamed Ovar Attempted
' Abduct iote
Hays. Kan., June 11 Because it is
felt that local talent" attempted the
abduction of 17 year o'd Ida Wilson
last Wednesday night, while her par
ents were away, and took her six
miles in an-automobile before she es
caped, the farming community six
teen miles southwest of here is arous
ed to a white heat of indignation.
The theory that the girl was walk
ing in her sleep was exploded today
by County Attorney Ed Flood, who
took her into custody six miles from
home although, barefoot, her feet
were hardly soiled. She bad several
deep scratches on her breast, arms
and face, in addition to the nag,
which Flood is using as a clew. Sher
iff A. O. Robinson also points out
that he discovered her barefoot
beside a man s shoe prints
she was forced to take to the
Failure of the lights of the
abductor's auto as he sped away with
Miss Wilson upset the attempt.
Miss Wilson was gagged and her
hands tied when the journey started,
she says. When the lights went out
she was forced to get out of the car,
iier captor holding her with one hana
while he worked with the other. At
one of these times she worked her
hands loose, the next time the lights
were attended to she escaped and ran
a distance into a field of wheat where
she hid. She says she could hear him
swishing through the wheat near her
and twice he almost fell upon her.
It is supposed that he heard an auto
approaching from the south and left.
Two boys, Lester Wilson and Carl
Kraus, who had been in McCracken
at the wedding of Lester's sister, and
were on their way back to Hays,
found the girl after her abdnctor had
fled. The boys helped to arouse the
neighborhood and sent word to the
sheriff at Hays. '. With guns in their
hands, A. W. Cope land, Henry lias
Child, Job Swisher and .John Swisher
watched the roads until daylight.
The girl is prostrated and - the
neiguoflmw, a -uuiuauatiy quiet and
peaceful district is in a tumult. The
remark of the would-be abductor,
when he gagged her in bed, "You are
going where all pretty girls go," has
intensified feeling.
Later By tracing the motor car
with which he is supposed to have at
tempted the abduction of Ida Wilson
of sixteen miles southwest of here
on the night of June 7, Walter Poe, a
young farmhand, was arr sted today
on the farm of Peter Gillig, eighteen
miles southwest of here on a warrant
sworn to by the father of the girl.
Poe asked his employer to borrow the
car but was refused. He is said to
have taken it and visited one farm
house and is said to have invited the
two daughters for a ride but was re
fused. He was familiar with the
neighborhood having worked for
years on the farm of Jake Kippes,
northeast of McCracken, and knew
that her parents were away. Capital
YOUR OPPORTUNITY
We wish to call attention of read
ers of the World to the advertisement
of the Royal Blue Gas Producer
which appears on page 5 of this issue.
In this advertisement Mr. Beckerap
peals to tiie retailers of Oklahoma in
particular, with the idea of securing
good, live agents for the Royal Blue
Gas Producer. This article has met
with unusual popularity and favor
in Kansas, and there is but little ter
ritory left in this state; hence Mr.
Becker is extending bis territory to
Oklahoma. The Royal Blue Gas Pro
ducer is an article that will sell in
every borne that is not supplied with
gas or electricity for beating and
lighting purposes. It has an advan
tage over either gas or electricity, In
that it can be used for either lighting
or heating, and the cost is reduced
fully seventy-five per cent, which is
an item deserving consideration. The
Royal Blue Gas Producer is unlike
the ordinary oil system as it does not
soot, smoke or dirt, and the continual
buzzing that is very noticable in the
oil burner is entirely eliminated in
the Royal Blue Gas Producer. The
light is a convenience and necessity in
every home and the party who
secures an agency for this article will
find that every home in - his territory
will be interested in making a pur
chase Price Current Adv.
MARKET REPORT
Kansas City Stock Yards, June 13
Washouts in the South .diverted
some quarantine cattle destined to
St. Louis to this market today which
added to a healthy run from local
territory made a total supply of 11,
000 bead, a liberal run. There was a
big delegation of prime cattle, and
sales of car lots ranged up to $11.25,
with odd bead at 11.35, new high
prices for- tnis year, and $1.85 above
the previous high June record. Beef
steers beiow .prime sold slowly, and
prices had a weak tendency. Western'
pulp feed steers sokl with a little les
action, tops at $10.80,' and some short
fed pulpers at $9.50. In the quaran
tine division disagreement as to val
ues retarded action, but the best cat
tle sold pretty nearly stead v, 12 cars
from the Fort Worth-district selling
at $9.60- to $9.35.' Some ' Southern
Texas grass steers soldi early at $7.40,
and plain little "'Oklahoma grass
steers sold down to $6.75. Total sup
ply in the quarantine division was 73
cars. Killers admit that beef is mov
ing into consumptive channels so fast
that they can scarcely keep up with
orders, but they , say prices will have
to be shaded as rapidly as the volume
of grass cattle increases enough to
warrant it, and the grassers will
move to market at the earliest possi
ble date this year, in efforts to get in
before prices decline. Stockers and
feeders are selling about steady, good
bred stock steers, around $7.75, feed
ers $3 to $8.50, bAit with the prospect
that these prices will be reduced in
the near future. .
Hogs received today 15,000 head,
market 10c to 15c higher, top $9.70,
bulk $9 35 to $9 60.- Demand for light
hogs 150 pounds and under, is not as
strong as for other grades, heavy
hogs leading as heretofore. Reduced
receipts are the cause of the swift re
covery of the hog market from recent
low spots, and the situation lias every
appearance of permanancy, consump
tion demand being such that killers
cannot keep the market within their
grip. Receipts at eleven leading
markets so far this year amount to
nearly 15 million hogs, 2 million more
than the same time last year, and 4
million more than the same period
two years ago, which gives an idea
of bow selling conditions favor the
producer this year,- especially when
viewed in connection with the high
range of prices, -t V
, ' Sheep aBd-lanxbs Exhibit weakness,

lambs sold at $11.35 today, best na
tives $11.25, and pretty good Arizonas

up to $7.20, and some feeding wethers

killers $5.25, Angora brusbers around
$5.10, slick haired br ushers $4.00' to

Wa-Keeney, Kans.,
Dear Sir:
As the time to begin to harvest
wheat draws near, the indications
point to a shortage of men. Last
year at this time this office had 2,818
inquiries mail, and 3,256 in person.
So far this year we have had 876 by
mail and 156 in person. This shows
that there is not as many idle men
in the country as at this time last
year. I quote from C. L. Green, 17. S.
General Inspector in charge Employ
ment and Distribution at Kansas
City, Mo.
I fear there will be a shortage of
men if the applications received here
indicate anything at all. We have
to date mail applications from 725
men, and 312 men have applied here
in person. There are perhaps a hun
dred men here available for harvest
work now, men who can pay their
own railroad fare. There are a num
ber on the way here, as I know but
in all I can see is about two thousand
men at the present time, or about
one fifth of the total in sight at this
time last-year.
There are a great number of men
offering their services if transporta
tion is advanced. 1 know that this
cannot be arranged, but I believe
that some of the farmers would pro
fit by coming here or Topeka and
taking the men out with them, de
ducting the transportation from the
pay of the men.
Farmers needing help should make
their wants known at once stating
wages they will pay. We will open
a branch office at Wichita at the city
hall on the 17th of this month, also
one at Salina on the 23th. All in
quiries relative to harvest help can
be directed to Free Employment
Office at Tqpeka, Wichita and Salina,
Kansas, also 804 Grand Avenue, Kan
sas, Mo. ,

P. J. McBride,
Director.
