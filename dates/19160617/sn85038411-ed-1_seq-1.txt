Washington. Jurje 17. Warning
from Mexican commanders that any
movement of American troops except
in retirement toward the border would
precipitate hostilities, will not change
tue purpose of the t'nited States gov
ernment to keep its expedition in
Northern Mexico, or prevent General
Pershing from taking any steps neces
sary to insure the safety of his own
columns, and deal with bandits threat
ening the border. No advance further
south is contemplated, and it is not
believed here the Oarranza forces are
planning an immediate attack upon
the present American forces.
The War Department to-day was
without advices from General Persh
ing regarding the warning said to
have been sent him by General
Trevino. the Oarranza commander at
Chihuahua, but General Funston re
ported the substance of a telephone
conversation he had with General
Bell at El Paso who stated it as a
fact that such a warning had been
given. As he has no direct com
munication with General Pershing it
is assumed he was told of the warn
iiiK by Mexican officials in Juarez or
El Paso. This is not regarded as
confirmation of Chihuahua City press
dispatches saying the warning had
been given on orders from Carranza
himself.
A direct report from General
Pershing was awaited.
Policy Unchanged
Secretary Lansing said to-day the
policy.of the I'nited States was un

END CONVENTION 1
WITH BIG FIGHT
Little Given Women Appeared ]
to Be in Danger of Being
Taken Away
Special to the
St. Louis. Mo., June 17. —The Dem- .
ocratic National Convention finished
its work last evening by adopting the 1
Party platform exactly as approved by
President Wilson and submitted by •
the Resolutions Committee, including
the plank on Americanism and that. !
favoring woman suffrage. but not :
until the harmony of its first three
days' sessions had been disturbed with
a row over the suffrage plank.
No voice was raised against the 1
vigorous declarations of the American
ism plank, but at one time it looked
as It the suffrage piank had been lost. !
After Senator Walsh, of Montana, had 1
told the convention that President i
Wilson himself considered it vital to c
party success, however, it was voted '
into the platform by a ballot of SBB>i '
to 18114. The. entire platform then '
was adopted without roll call.
As it went into the platform the '
suffrage plank stands:
"We favor the extension of the i
franchise to the women of this coun- <
try . State by State, on the -same term 9 1
as to the men."
The real fight when Governor
Ferguson, of Texas, who headed the
minority report against the adminis- \
