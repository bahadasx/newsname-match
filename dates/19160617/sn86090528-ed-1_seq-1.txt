WORK ON
BUILDING
UNDERWAY
. Preliminary work upon the junior
high school is progressing as rapidly
as weather and other conditions will
permit. 1'ractically all excavations
have been completed and the founda
tion trenches dug, while the work of
setting those foundations, of concrete,
has already begun.
II. A. Cranwell, acting superintend
ent in charge, on behalf of the board
of education, stated this morning that
material would be on hand as fast us
needed and said that the time of com
pletion of the building would necessa
rily depend to a great extent upon the
weather. I'p to the present the weath
er has been far from favorable for the
quick advance of the work. The foun
dation excavations, however, are shal
low, the foundation being calculated
only to sustain the weight of a one
story structure, and this admits of
the work on the primary part of the
structure being advanced far more
rapidly than would be the case were
the building to be of heavier super
structure. Mr. Cranwell stated that a full force
of men were kept at work and that
the only delays thus far met with had
been those brought about by the exces
sive rains of the past few days.
Everything, Mr. Crr,trwell stated,
would be wjuked out. in the matter of
the construction work, with minute
attention to detail, while the contrac
tor, tho supervising architect and the
superintendents in charge of the work
will exert -every effort to have the
building ready for oc cupancy as near
expiration of the time limit as
possible.
M. S. Cralle, one of tho members of
the school .board, made the statement
that if careful attention to detail and
hard work upon the part of the con-
I). Sanders, of tractor would make me eany compie
I lion of the building possible, that ob
ject would be accomplished. He stated
that all members of the school board,
and Superintendent Kamey, of the
city schools, were taking an active in
terest in the work, each giving the
matter a part of his attention each
week.

SHEEGOGIS
CANDIDATE
Outlining his attitude with refer
ence to general Issues that confront
the people of Oklahoma. lid Sheegog
today announced his candidacy for
representative of Crady county in the
slate legislature. Mr. Sheegog was
born on an uninentioned date in Texas
where, he spent his early life on a
farm. .v';en a very young man he en
listed In the army when the call for
volunteers was made at the outbreak
of the Spanish-American war. After
the war was over, he located in Okla
homa. For a number of years he has
lived in Chickuriha, being engaged In
the abstract and loan business. In a
personal and business way he ranks
among the best men in Grady county,
Mr. Sheegog issued the following
statement:
"I do not seek the office for any .pur
pose other than to try and render
honest service to the people of Grady
county and the entire state. I am a
Democrat, because I believe in the
principles of the Democratic- party,
and I believe that a continuation of
Democ ratic: policies will result in per
manent peace, prosperity and honest
and efficient government in both state
and nation.
"1 favor such legislation as will con
tinue the development of. the natural
wealth and resources of the state,
guarantee equal opportunity to all and
protect and safeguard the interests of
ttaq farmers and the working man and
every other ' citizen to the end that
each may enjoy the fruits of his own
industry.
"I believe that every class of prop
erty should bear its equal and just
burden of taxation and I would favor
such laws as will bring pbout this re
sult. "1 think the affairs of the state
should be run as nearly as pmsihlc
on a business basis and that every
state institution should' be made as
nearly self supporting as possible by
applying business nielli ids at,:! infiii
agemeut in all state affairs.
"1 favor the maintenance and sup
port of the public, schools and slate
educational institutions to the end
that, the opportunities and facilities
for education in Oklahoma be equal
to those of any state in the Union.
"Permanent good roads are the
greatest asset of any agricultural
community and t shall favor such fur
ther legislation as will bring about tins
construction and maintenance of a
system of good substantial roads in
every community.
"I believe that the permanent com
mon school and other educational
funds should lie loaned to the farmers
of the state as provided for in the con
stitution at five per cent interest.
The management ol these funds should
be such that a farmer can senile a
loan, have his land appraised, title
examined and al! necessary details
completed within ten days and with
no expense, except such as is neces
sary incident thereto.
