Pershing is Told He Must Not
Move South. West or East
in Mexican Territory.
AN ATTACK IS THREATENED
War Department Says Pershing
is Prepared tor Any
Possible Eventuality.
? * *c?oeiATcr *<??>
WASHINGTON*. June 17.?General
Funston advised the war department
today that he was Informed I?v General
Hell at El Paso that General Pershing
had been warned by General Trevino,
tne Carraiua commander at < hlhuahua,
that any movement of the American
expedition to the south, west or
east would be a signal for an attack
by the Mexican forces.
No word has corne so far from General
Pershing himself, but even before
the arrival of General Punston's message.
department officials were inclined
to credit newspaper despatches
telling of the Trevino warning.
Preparations have been made for
any eventuality and Pershing is ready
to deal with any force that may be
sent against him. It is probable, however.
that he will hold to his present
11in*?* nun mum* mi inuvc.
Practically all available regulars
of the United Statim arrnv including
many coast artillerymen already are
on the border or in Mexico and the
national guard of Texas, Arizona and
New Mexico are in service for patrol
duty. The guardsmen of other states
were notified some weeks ago to be
prepared to respond if it should become
necessary to call them out.
It was learned today that considerable
correspondence has been exchanged
between the department and
governors and adjutant generals of
various states relative to the new
status given the guardsmen under
the Hay-Chamberlain army organization
hill, which becomes effective
July 1. These messages are presided
to have caused recurrent reports
that the entire force of the national
guard was being prepared for
active service.
^ OUTLAW BAND ACTIVITIES
LOOKED AFTER ON BORDER
<av AisociATio m???.
SAN ANTONIO. June 17.?General
Funston and his staff gave careful
attention today to tlic activities of outlaw
hands along the Mexican border
but far greater interest was displayed
in the attitude being assumed by the
troops of the de facto government.
General Ricaut's warning that the
crossing of the international boundary
nv American intnps tur nuj uiudiwould
he regarded as an overt act and
would he the cause for an attack by
the de facto government troops did
not disturb General Funston. The
search for bandits, it was declared,
will continue and whenever "a hot
trail" is found, leading into Mexico,
the Americans will not hesitate to follow
it. The officers in charge of
troops on the border have authority to
cross into Mexico without waiting for
instructions.
General Kunston's army of almost
50,000 has been so disposed along the
Mexican border that swift punitive action
could he taken if invited by any
overt ect of r'armnm's army. General
Trevino's threat to attack General
Pershing, if the American troops move
east or west or south, was regarded
by army officers here as little less than
a declaration of hostilities by the Mcx
