EH Pas(5, June 17.—Carransa having
thrown- down .the gauntlet to the
United States in his advices to General
Pershing thkt any troop movement
.., east, w*st or eouth would be regarded
as. a hostile act, every preparation
was being made along the border to-'
day ftr eventualities.
Officers and soldiers here were kept
closely" to their quarters.
Street car service to Juarez was at
a'standstill, and efforts were made to
persuade Americans not to cross the
river.
Tension was noticeable on the Mexi

were arming themselves. It was re

was being pushed in all the larger
cities in northern (Mexico.
There were no indications toward

-Zapata Rebellion Crushed.
Gen. Pablo Gonzales, directing the
campaign against the bandit leader
Zapata in Morelos, has' made impor

The capture Is claimed of twenty

General Gonzales furthermore

General Trevino's threat

General Pershing if, the Americans

by army officers here as little less
than a declaration of hostilities by the
Mexicans, since It may be necessary at
any time for the leader of the big pu

tachments in purisuit of bandit bands.
Precaution taken-by General Beil in
holding all Amerlcan troo^s for action

Browpsville,- Tex., June 17.—Revival
of bandit activity in' the lower Rio
Grande valley last -night resulted in
vigorous action by authorities today
which was interpreted here as presag
ing a determined attempt to
rcheck
the
periodical recurrence of .outlawry by
dealing with the marauders on Am
orlean swi."
Soon after reports wero received that
bandits appeared near San Benito sev
eral troops were ^under way to deal
with them. Motor cars were com
mandeered and two companies of the
Twenty-sixth infantry were dispatched
to Olmlto, .ten Ibiiles north of Browns
ville, with orders torcut off the bandits*
retreat across the Rlo Grande into
Mexico.
Meanwhile another force of iwo
companies of infantry sent from Ban
Benito earlier In the night to investi
gate reports that the Joe Scott ranch
had been attacked, found the bandits
ten miles east of San Benjto. A run
ning fight took place, in which, ac
cording to meager reports, three Mexi
cans were killed.
In addition to these two forces a
troop of cavalry was dispatched when
reports came that another bandit force
had appealed near the Fresnos tract,
fourteen miles north of Brownsville,
and had robbed a Mexican farmer of
his horses.
Troops Hot on Trail.
It was'reported to army headquar
ters today that a troop of the Third
cavalfy under Major Newman had
struck a "hot trail" of Mexican ban
dits north of Brownsville These ban
dits are supposed to have been the
same who attacked American soldiers
at'iSan (Benito last night.
Reports that three Mexicans were
killed in the fight with American sol
diers ilast night are declared to be un
true. The. soldiers, however, believe
they wounded several of the members
of the band.
The fight followed the kidnaping
during the afternoon of a 'Mexican
farmer named Lugar, Lugar'e nephew
escaped and gave the alarm.
SUFFS TURN ON WILSONi
Demand Direct Statement From Presi
dent on Suffrage.
St. Louis, June 17.—Leaders of both
tlie woman's party and the National
American Woman Suffrage Association
united in denouncing aB inadequate the
suffrage plank of the democratic plat
form and declared they would imme
diately resume th6i* light in congres%
Mr national recognition.
It has been the contention of the
suffragists that the democratic' party
being the party in power should take
a more definite stand on the subject
of woman suffrage than the republi
cans. Representatives of the national
woman's party, formed last week at
Chicago, appeared before the Resolu
tions committee with threats that Un
less a frank declaration in advocacy: of
the federal amendment to the consti
tution giving the vote to women were
adopted by the convention the women
of the twelve states where womin now
have the vote, would throw their,
strength to the republican party. Not
withstanding the threats the plank
adopted was substantially the same as
that adopted by the republicans in Chi
cago.
"We shall return to Washington as
quickly as possible," Miss Ann Martin,
chairman of th» woman's party, said.
rWe are going to give the democratic
congress one more chahce to make
good before adjoi/rnment..' If it does-not
see fit to pass a constitutional amend
ment war will follow.

shall give congressional leaders every
chance to read that Interpretation into
it if they want to. I regard the demo
cratic plank weaker than the republi
can. The preamble of the latter, at
least, is regarded by some aB giving
national indorsement to suffrage.
"Thus far we have not worked out
details of our plans for fighting the
democratic party this fall, for we have
hopes that the congressional leaders
will see the light. But if they con
tinue to oppose us, ^'c ??i!! fight them.
And it will be a good fight, too. We
have 4,000,000 women voters, $500,000
in cash, a good cause and a determined
spirit. With all of these we cannot
help but win."
Immediately after the adjournment
of the convention Mrs. Carrie Chap
man Catt, president of the National
Woman Suffrage Association, called a
special meteing of her national board
later issued the following official

Issues Shap Statement.
"No suffragist who was present at
the convention today could mis
interpret either the speech or the ac
tion taken by the democratic prfrty in
adopting the alleged woman suffrage
plank in its national platform.
"The democrats admitted freely In
their speeches that 'political exigency'
demanded 'some |!rid of a suffrage
plank,' and they thought to hoodwink
the women by a jumble of words that
were designed to meet the situation,
but in no sense succeeded.
"The sJ-called suffrage plank which
they adopted, aftieijr bursts of eloquence
that were far more frank than intelli
gent, cannot be expected to win the
presidential campaign for them. But
it may well be expected to win the
antagonism of millions of men and
women voters Wall partri of the coun
try.
Was It Cheap Politioa?
"If the plank adopted today Is the
president's choice, the world may just
ly accuse him of descending to the
tricks of the* cheapest politician in or
der to bid for votes by flaunting a
plank that may be Interpreted in as
many ways as there are people."
WILSON PLANK ON
SUFFRAGE ADOPTED
Effort to Subatitute More Definite
Statement Fails and Platform is
Adopted Just As Presented by Com
mittee on Resolutions.
St. "Louis, June 17.—A battle came at
length among the democrats, and wom
an waa a£ the bottom of It all.
It waa started by Governor -Tumi, e.
Ferguson, of Texas, representing a seg
ment of the "southern chivalry," and a
group of Andy Jackson hardQbells.
®®r. "FSrgujun, however,/ was more
adept in startingaom«jtffing than fin
ishing
.'at--- TiiA call during^the
entire copvqntioa was ordt^rfed to fettle
the dispute. And the champions of" the
wpmeu won by a vote of 888% to 181%.
At one© the platform waa put thru
viva voce and the democratic national
convention of 1916 adjourned.
For a postlude the brass band sped
the delegates on their way from the
Coliseum with the old battle hymn of
the moose, "Onward, Christian Soldier."
Wilson had triumphed the women
had emerged victorious and the demo
crats, aching for one of their custom
ary flights to liven up the harmony,' had
pulled a fracas.
Better still, they had run true to the
traditions of romance and had flashed
their blades over women, while in the
galleries and the hanging balconies tne
suffragists waved their yellow flags and
ribbons. And every one was satisfied
and contented, even the wounded
knight from Texas, who fell in the
tournament.
The "votes for women" plank was*
the sole item in the platform over which
the delegates fought. The Mexican
plank, nailed in at the last minute by
•.he platform builders, did not stih a
ripple. It interested the delegates so
that part of it was read twice on de
mand, but it created no surprise or sen
sation.

Columbia, Syracuse and Pennsylvania
were confronted today with most un
favorable weaither prospects for their
twenty-second annual regatta to be
rowed on the Hudson this afternoon.
The wind from the southeast and a
drizzling rain promised to dampen the
enthusiasm of thousands of- college
men arriving for the battle. The ad
vance tihrong was greatly augmented
today with the arrival of loaded trains.
Hotel lobbies were crowded.
Much speculation has arisen in cose

In such an, event It Is conceded that
the inside course, held by Columbia,
will have an advantage.
As Syracuse and Cornell have
courses three and four, respectively,
the advantage of Columbia over her
most dangerous rivals furnished a
knotty problem.1
