Selection of
Chairman
and of Other Officials
Is Confirmed
St. Louis, Mo., June 17 At an early
hour today President Wilson was in
undisputed control of his campaign for
re-election. Vance MeConniek of Penn
sylvania has been ratified as chairman
of the national committee, over the
muttered protests of a large portion
of the committee and over the out
spoken objections of a few members.
Final vote on the question, taken long
after midnight, resulted in only two
votes being cast against the president's
slate, which included Carter Glass of
Virginia for secretary, Homer S. Cum
niings, of Connecticut, for vice-chairman,
and Wilbur W. Marsh of Iowa,
treasurer.
K. W. H. Moore, of Ohio, and W. F.
Sapp, of Kansas, were the" only com
mittee men willing to go on final
record with their protest.
Moore's principal argument was
that, by following the president's
directions in the matter, the national
committeemen were taking away all
their own political power they became-merely
collectors of campaign
funds, ho said.
."I deny the right of the president
to take away, from us the right to have
some say in the selection of our next
presidential candidate, which we will
have if we elect a chairman from our
own committee," lie declared.
In the course of the evening's argu
ment, R. S. Hudspeth of New Jersey,
called President Wilson by telephone.
"My choice of Mr. McCormick is in
accordance with the precedent estab
lished,", the president said, "and that
is all have to say."
The only other contest of importance,
that from' Texas, resulted in the seat
ing of William Poindexter as national
committeeman.

As an army man, Wood cannot bat

to see Roosevelt with coat off working

Hughes day was quiet. .In the fore

Russian Drive Relieves Pres-
sure On Italian Front-
Dunkirk Bombarded
London, Juno 17. That the Austri-I
ans, driven back from their first line
of trenches on the eastern front have
settled into new positions of strength
and are stubbornly resisting the Russian-advance,
is the conclusion gained
here from the fact that the Russian
official report does not carry statement
of tremendous gains daily as in the first
several days of the. drivo.
Tho capture of Czernowitz, capital
of Bukowina is' not yet officialy con
firmed though reported unofficially
from several sources. Its capture has
not been denied from Vienna.
From a few miles north Tarnopol to
Brody, the Austrians have held their
ground steadily, due, says l'etrograd,
to the fact that the greatest violence
of the Russian drive has been devel
oped north and south of this sector.
The. drive already has had the effect
of lessening in marked degree the Aus
trian pressure against the Italians on
the Trentiuo front. King Victor Em
manuel of Italy has congratulated the
czar on tho success of the offensive.

Artillery Duel at Verdun.
Paris, June 17. Violent artillery at
tacks are continuing on both banks of
the Mcuse, Verdun front, m-cording
to the official statement of the French
war office today.
Tho duel of big guns in the Avoeourt
sector is particularly heavy. Dead Man's
hill last night was inferno of shell
fire.
A German hand grenade attack at
Avoeourt was easily repulsed.
In the Vosgcs, east of Thann a de
tachment of French infantry penetrated
two German lines, killing many of the
defenders and taking other prisoners.
The altuckcrs returned without suf
fering losses.
Denial that the French have been
driven from thir freshly won trenches
on the southern slope of Dead Man's
hill, as claimed by the Germans, is
made at the French war office.
According to the German official
statement, the French, by counter at
tack, were hurled back, leaving pris
oner4jn the hands of the German.
The French insist that they are still
holding their ga5ms, a kilometer of
trenches, and that in the attack more
than "00 Germans were taken.

ors arriving here were subpoenaed to
testify at the inquiry. Every effort
will bo made to learn what was re
sponsible for the disaster to the Bear,
which cost five lives.
Many additional details of the ship
wreck scenes were given by survivors
here today. They came on a special
train from Eureka. Miss Agnes Loftus,
an actress, said she was in a lifeboat
that capsized. Ono of the sailors seized
her by the hair and kept her afloat
until they reached land. Then 'Miss
Loftus helped save Mrs. George H.

The nerves of many passengers from
the overturned boats were evidently
severely shaken. They described their
xperiences as terrible." Drifting blindly
through the foggy night in small boats
with children crying and some women

Courtroom, Waukegaii, 111., June 17
The "eighteen bunch" had thoir inning,
in the game for tho life or death of Will
Orpet today.
Tho "bunch" only now 16 strong"
are school girls, chums of Marion Lam
bert, and they came into the big court
room half laughing, half frightened and
took the stand, one after the other,
to aid the prosecution of tho youth wh
wrecked the life of their friend.
They had been iu court before, but
this was their day the day they were
to refute the story of Josephine Levia,
now ostracised from the "bunck' who
said Marion had cried and threatened
suicide on the day of her eighteenth
birthday party, four days bofore her
body was found.
Bernicc Wells came first to the UmI.
"What did Marion ny to you when,
you left tho Lambcit home tho day
of the party f" tho prosecutor asked.
- " 'Bernice, I am awfully glad yon
could come' that's what she said,"
tho witness answered. . .
"Then she said she would meet no
at Eleanor Double 'a home the next Sun
day." .. .
"But she didn't meet yout" asked
the prosecutor. '
"She was dend," Bernice answered.
Then the state got down to the ques-
tion it wanted brought out,
i v
"I "id not."
"Did vou sec hw crying?"
"No." , ... ,
Tells Same Story.
Florence Russell came next.
"Did you see any one crying at that'
birthday party!" she was asked.
"Yes," said Florence. "Anna Paul
son was crying."
"Anyone else?" -
"Yes, Marion Lambert, both were
crying togcthor."
"What did Marion and Annasayt",
"Marion said: 'Anna I'm awfully
sorry you did not nrrunge to stay all
night with me. Wo haven't missed
staying together on my birthday for 15
years.' "
'Was that all sho was crvinz

"Yes."
Then the state turned Miss Russell
over to Attorney Potter of the defense
for cross examination.
Fliirfunle inilmithvi she iwas " hist
friendly" with Marion and that sho
was not alone with her on tho day of
her birthday party.
".Marion told me Sunday morning.
that sho had learned Will Orpet was en
gaged to Miss Youker, and that Jose-
Bin had written Will and soon Will
would come down and tell her the
straight truth of it," Miss Russell said.
On re drci't examination the utate

"Marion told me Orpet was of a

said. "lie would get mad and fly off
into a temper, Marion said sho liked
him that way."
1 lion Miss Russell sprang the testi
