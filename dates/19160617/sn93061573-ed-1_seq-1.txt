try for Re-Elci-tion.
"At eleven fifty-five Thursday night
in tiie Collisum at St. Louis, two
thousand Democratic delegates ex
pressed their approval of President
Wilson's conduct of the nations af
fairs during the past four years and
honored him with the nomination
for the highest office in the pi ft, of
the American people.
The I emorratic convention open
ed Wednesday, called to order by
.National Chairman William 1'. Me
Combcs. Martin II. Ulyiui, former
governor of the State of New York,
.sounded the keynote of Americanism
and peace, preparedness and pros
perity. The convention which was pollen!
under way with such -perfunctory j
demonstrations as mark every na- '
lional gathering of 't lie kind, soon!
.stirred ilself into roaring cheers as j
Chairman Glynn cited historic uar-j
allels to show that other Presidents. I
ed threatening foreign .situations'
without resort to war.
"The policy of the administration
he declared, "has been just as Amer- !
ican as the American Hag itself." 1
He went down the list, of J'resi-
dents, recounting their actions to!
avoid war. Hie ddigates caught, the j
spirit of his argument and as he re- j
lerred io each particular President
s e delegate would call: "What, did
, he do." .
"i!" netleil the trouble by negotia
tion," was the reply which Glynn iu
variably returned and the, conven
tion would roar its approval. Will
iam J. Hryan, as a newspaper cor
respondent in the press stand, wept
with emotion as Glynn pistured the
- vii'M h'S of peace, but be laughed
with the crowd when a Texas dele
gate, interrupting Glynn, leaped to
his chair and cried:
.nii don l lurgci mat policy is
also satisfactory to William Jennings
Bryan."
v Asiue i coin a sixteen minute dem
onstration when Chairman Glynn,
predicted President Wilson's re-election,
Glynn's speech was sprink
led. with demonstrations which he
found it dilHcult to Mill so he could
o on. It was plain that the telling
points oif the delegates were the re
rial of President Wilson's effort to
keep the counry at peace.
'lhis policy," be said, "May not
satisfy the (Ire eater and the swash
buckler. Hut it does satisfy the
mothers of the land, at whose hearth
and fireside no jingoistic war has
placed and empty chair. It does
satisfy the daughters of the land,
from whom bluster and brag have
sent no loving brother to the dissol
ution of the grave. It does satisfy
the fathers of this land and the sons
of (his land, who will tight for our
Hag and die for our Hag when reason
primes the ritle: when honor draws
the sword and when justice breathes
a blessing on the standard they up
hold. The last of the words were drown
ed out in a roar of applause that
swept the Coliseum.
"Hepeat it," cried the delegates:
"Hepeat it."
"All right, be quiet and I'll re
peat it," responded Glynn, and he
did, to applause and cheering.
No other President since the Civil
War, Glynn told the convention, had
faced such crucial problems, none
had displayed a grasp of statesman
ship more profound.
Ex-Governor Glynn's declarations
upon Americanism as to neutrality
is as American as the American
Hag," were- given a prolong demon
stration. When Mr. Glynn predicted the re
election of President Wilson the del
' igates rose en masse and cheered.
The speaker, laughing, tried vainly
to secure quiet, but the deligates
were determined to have it out, the
uproar alternately rising and ebbing.
THE INTERESTS pF GOOD CITIZENSHIP AND THE UPBUILDING OF THE
THE
Further atteniuls to stop the dem-
nustration were answered by renew-j
ed sheering. !
Glynn pounded the gravel, trying
to silence the throng, but soon the ;
lloor was again a sea .of Hags. The
New Jersey delegation, bearing its
stanchion, began the first proceedion 1
down the front isles, stanchions of'
Illinois, Maryland, Indiana and other !
states sooit followed. i
The ( crowds got entirely out of
hand, but police prevented a general
procession by ordering the deligates
to their stations. .
Artec sixteen minutes, quit was I
restored and Mr. Glynn proceeded. '
In the midst of the peroration, the
braying of a ilouki-y disturbed Ex- !
Governor Glynn for a moment. The i
sound came through a window front:
a stable in the rear. Evidently the
Governor regarded the braying as,
approval. The'audioncc laughed, the i
speaker smiled and continued to the!
end a laudation of Wondrnw Wilson
as "President, and President to be.";
He concluded at -:.'!0 p. in. The del

At a meeting of the Town Trus
tees, held Tuesday evening, the clerk
was instructed to communicate with
concerns manufacturing street signs
and house numbers with the inten
tion of naming and numbering all
streets and houses in Clayton. Thi
step is deemed advisable owing to
the rapidly increasing size of the
town and the difficulty of stranger!,
and ithers in locating residences anil
business houses. J
The chili wagon of Sam Dandrea
and the boot and shoe repair shop of
J. W. Tolly were ordered removed
from their location owing to the
fact that they do not meet the re-
17. 1916
quirennnts of the tire ordinance for
buildings located in the tire dis
! trict.'
I Van Ordt brothers- petitioned the
! board to grade Second Street be
, tween Chestnut and Main. The pe
tition was granted. A verbal com
plaint was made by the Yan Ordt
'brothers that the Clayton Garace &
; Auto Co., were using the street as a
'spillway for xva.-te water and asked
j that, the use of the street for that
purpose be stopped. The board re
, quested the complaint in writing and
i will take action in the matter at a
! future meeing.
Allen H. Nye, representing the Nep
tune Meter Co., appeared before the
board to demonstrate the merits of
his water meter. The demonstra
tion xxas d Terrcd until the doard
could bear from various cities that
are using the Neptune Meter.
The engineer in charge of the Test

he xxas unable to make a definite
report, at this meeting but would he

l ire. oT unknown origin, Friday
night destroyed the Clayton Mill and
all its contents. The total loss, ac
cording to hr. Charlton, the owner,
is between ten and twelve thousand
dollars, which is only partially cover
eil by insurance.
The lire was the most spectacular
seen iii Clayton for many years. Txvo
theories are adxauced as to the or
igin of tin' blaze. The lire originated
in the motor room and may have
been caused by a cross circuit in the
electric wires; or, as there has been
considerable petty thieving going on
in the mill premises, it may have
been a dropped match which fell in.
to a pile of inllamable rubbish.
The building and machinery ai-e
a total lossind represent a sum of
more than nine . thousand dollars.
There was some grain and Hour stor
ed in the ware rooms and Dr. Charl
ton estimates tho loss from this
source as nearly three thousand dol
lars. lThero is little possibility that the
mill will be rebuilt this year. Dr.
