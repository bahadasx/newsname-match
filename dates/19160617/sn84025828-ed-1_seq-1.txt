PRIVATE SNAPS
Chicago Voters Are Complaining About
Growing Insolence and Swell Headed-
ness of Office Holding Aristocrats.

Information of an Interesting Character from the
Public Offices and About Men in
Publie Life.
General Gossip About Men and Doings in the Various
Political Camps, and the Aspirants for
Office and Honors.
The Big Presidential Campaign and the Important Places to Be Filled
Attract the Attention of the Voters of Illinois.
Tha overbearing insolence of sonio
of the ofllco holders In the City Iall
and County Building calls attention to
tho fact that an. Offlca Holdlng-Arls-.tocracy
ia rapidly crowing into perma
nent control of our public affairs.
Among our officials thoro are somo
honorablo exceptions somo mon who
feel that they aro in olllco to servo
tho people.
But there are others and their
number is increasing who imngino
that tho only thing the average citizen
is good for is to vote.
Party allegiance is forgotten when
they nro sworn in and the Jobs go
to relatives, regardless of party or fit
ness. Tho Office Holding Aristocracy has
no uso for tho voter after ho has used
him.
Horbort Kaufman paid his respects
to theso follows when ho called atten
tion to their treatment of tho public
in these words:
"You consider yourself an important
person becauso your position occasion
ally permits you to annoy people But
so can a gnat, a rusty hlngo, a rattling
window and other minor bothers.
"Impudenco 1b a Smart-nlock's con
ception of lmpresslvoness a back
stairs notion of 'big folks" bohavlor.
An upstart betrays himself by the
manner he displays his authority.
"Those who aren't accustomed to
the use of power invaiiably abuse.it.
"Insolence is tho snarl of tho Insig
nificant 'big head' evidence of a
small one.
"You merely show up when you,
show off. Wo all know Just about
what your Job pays and thoreforo how
much intelligence it demands so why
bluff?
"Ofllco boys, bell hops and cash
girls may possibly mlstako your im
pertlnenco as a manifestation of su
periority, j but tho publlo recognizes
tho asBtiitho'ill fitting lion's skin.
"Headquarters' always hoars tho
creak In the machino and soon locates
tho source of tho trouble"
Tho voters of Chicago may bo fools
somo of tho tlmoj thoy may be so
suplno part of tho time that theso Pub
lie Ofllco Aristocrats look upon them
as sorfs.
But tho voters of Chicago aro not
going to bo foolB all of tho timo.
And when thoy wake up, somo of
theso swell heads will boar from them.

Democrats Have a Chance This
Fall to Drop Some Office Hold

Blood in Some County
Offices.
The terms of some of tho Office
Holding Aristocrats expire next fall.
The Democratic party can make a hit
by refusing to renominate them.
If the party does renominate them

Democrats Must Retire Puffed-
up County Officials Whose
Terms Expire This Year
If They Wish to Win

Tho principal chargo brought
against two of the Domocratto county
officials whoso terms oxplro noxt fall
Is that they aro swell headed.
This Is a bad year for swell heads.
Party workers may bo induced
agalnBt their will to renominate them.
But the voters will not re-elect
them.
THE CITYCOUNCIL
Work of the Aldermen at Their
Last Regular Meeting.
The City Council on Monday night
raised tho salaries of Municipal
Judges from $6,000 to $9,000 a year.
Comparatively few of the support
ers of the ordinance for the increase
talked in its favor. Alderman Ken
nedy said against it:
"The street laborers asked a few
weeks ago for a raise from $2.25 a
day to 2.75, and you tonight havo
granted a raise from $2.25 to $2.40.
That Is a 15 cent raiso and yot no
additional appropriation is made.
Now you propoBO to grant a 50 per
cent increase to tho Judges, or $3,000
a year It's an outrage There's
nothing Just or squaro about it. Why
not pay a living wago first?"
"Tho plan is not equitable," said
Alderman Mcrriam, "when thero aro
so many demands upon tho public
treasury. Tho increaso will not get

He had passed an order directing
the judiciary committee to prepare
bills for the legislature providing for
a merit plan In the selection of Judges
and the places of all employes of the
court under civil service.
From the line-up it appears that the
city administration was In favor of the
Increase.
Alderman DePrlest also desired to
have an appropriation made for in
creasing the aldermanlo salaries. Al
derman Cullerton objected and forced
delay. i
CONNERV'S WON
DERFUL SCHEME
Booming the Torrens Fad and
Telling Voting Suckers of its
Wonders for .Three Months
Prior to the Coming Primary at
Which He Will Be Seeking Re
nomination, Causes Surprise
that He Didn't Ask County to
Spend $5,000 of the Peoples'
Money for This Purpose Before
During Four Years He Has
Been in Office.
The County Board has voted $5,000
of the peoples' money to enable Re
corder Joseph F. Connory to keep him
self and Torrens beforo tho publlo at
public expense for tho three months
preceding tho coming Democratic pri
mary. This Is about tho boldest plcco of
work tho people havo been startled
with for some time.
It shows that the gentleman some
times roferrcd to as Cemetery Joe, has
a fight on his hands this time.
Pour years ago the Republican par
ty was split Into two equal parts and
a Democratic nomination was equal
to an election.
This being the case, Connory, who
had never been heard of in politics be
fore, was yanked from his position as
an improvement star in a gravo yard
company and tossed into an office that
disposes of $1,400,000 of tho peoples'
money in the matter of patronago.
Tho way that this patronage has
been handled will be shown up in tho
coming campaign.
So will tho voting of $.',000 of tho
taxpayers' money to advertiso Con

TORRENS BUNK
Connery's Scheme Will Drive Hundreds
of Honest Abstract Makers Out of
Business If It Is Adopted.
But Real Estate Men and Property Owners Regard
Game With Just Suspicion and
Won't Touch It.
Public Men and Public Conditions as
tho People in the Light
Performances.
General Information of
of the
Joseph F. Connery, in Tho Eagle's
opinion, has mado a passable Record
er of Deeds.
But The Englo, together with thou
sands of Its fellow citizens, believes
that Mr. Connery Is making a great
mistake in warring upon tho private
abstract business in Chicago.
Tho Chicago Eaglo believes in com
petition in tho uustrnct field as well
as in every other field.
For that reason it is opposed to
Government monopoly of any lino of
Oldest Bank In Chicago.
business, whether that monopoly is
owned by tho National, Stato, County
or City Governments.
If the Torrens Systom of abstract
making that Mr. Connory appears to
bo so much interested In is a good
thing, it will prove that fact itself
without having to bo forced upon tho
public. The people aro not all fools.
Its adoption by tho people gener
ally, which la not at all likely, no mat
tor how much taxpayers' money may
be blown in on advertising the fad,
would result ia Increasing tho county
payrolls,
Our good friend Connery Is not do-
a Public and Political
State and All Parties
ing tho Democratic party any good by
his advocacy of tho Torrens fad.
Because, in tho list bt abstract
makers whom ho is trying to drivo
out of business aro moro good Demo
crats than ho has working under him
in tho Ilccorder's office.
A register of tho leading nnd vet
eran abstract makers employed by
prlvnto capital in making obstructs in
Chicago, discloses tho names of many
lifelong Democrats and highly respect
ed citizens of Chicago who have de
voted their political activities to pro
moting tho Interests of tho Demo
cratic party.
Among theso sterling Domocratlo
abstract makers wo noto tho
Nenrys,
Shortnlls,
O'Connors,
McGlllons,
Joneses,
Murphys,
Grahams,
Illleys,
O'.Mearns,
Grimes,
Nicholsons.
And others, overy one of whom havo
rendered a llfo tlmo of Domocratlo
service.
Theso mon with thejr connections
make an army that would outnumber
not only tho Ilccorder's ofllco, but
most nil of tho other offices in tho
County Building.
"Modern Evolution," as tho Tor
rens Faddists call It, may bo nil right,
but Government should not bo used
to put honest trades and occupations
out of existence,
Thoro Is an nmplo field In Chicago
for both Outsiders and Recorders.
A monopoly lu Government hands
is oven moro dangerous than a
monopoly in prlvnto hands.
