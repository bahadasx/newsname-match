ST. LOUIS, June 16.—For
President WOODROW WIL
SON of New Jersey.
For Vice President—THOM
AS R. MARSHALL of Indiana.
This ticket was renominated
by the Democratic national con
vention in the coliseum here a
few minutes before midnight to
night. The President was not
literally nominated by acclama
tion. One delegate defiantly
shouted "No" when Chairman
James put the question. This
was Delegate-at-Large Emmett
R. Burke of Chicago.
It took the bloom off the rose.
Senator James was obliged to
announce the vote 1092 to 1.
The renomination of Mr. Wil
son was accomplished at 11:56
after a nominating speech by
Judge John W. Wescott of New
Jersey and seconding speeches
by former Gov. Judson A. Har
mon of Ohio and Gov. Stuart of

CONSTABLES FORM
CO-OPERATIVE ASOC.
The constables of Indiana Co.
have formed an organization
through which they hope that
the capture of criminals will be
simplified. The organization
was planned by the court and
the district attorney, and is
along the line of a county police
force.
The name, address and tele
phone number of every con
stable in the county has been
listed. A copy will be placed in
the hands of every constable.
Where a crime is committed the
organization will find it very
easy to get the officials of the en

apprehension of the criminal.

ST. LOUIS, June 16.—"Col

from Alabama, is here," says
today's issue of the St. Louis
"Globe-Democrat" under a two
column half-length cut of none
other than "Bill" Fairman of
Punxsutawney. Not content
with putting the Pennsylvanian
as coming from Alabama, the
paragraph continues: "He is a
noted criminal lawyer, who has
a record of having defended 72
men for murder, securing the
acquittal of all but one. He
dresses in the style of the typi
cal old southerner, and has the
lovable drawl and intonation."
Such is fame.
Whether the enthusiastic re
porter who discovered Bill to be

"a character" was framed or
learned.
Nothing made "Bill" mad but
the reference to the Southern
drawl, which he certainly has
not.—Pittsburgh Sun
