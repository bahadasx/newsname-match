MR. FARMER:
I submit the above statement for your consideration before placing your insurance this year.
The Alminac predicts severe hail storms in 1916. Are you prepared? In 1915 we paid more than
50 claims for losses. The smallest was, for $1 CO; the largest for $2800, and not one dissatisfied cus
tomer. . We have established a record for prompt payment of, losses in 1915, why not place, your'
business. with us this year? Don't let the other fellow talk 'you into insuring with an Irresponsible
Company but see us NOW. What is, worth doing at all is worth doing quickly.
- Our Patrons are Our Best Recommendation
P. S. We will write your Hail business at cash rates, without interest Our losses will be
adjusted again by our own men, payment being made in the field on day of adjustment. Does this
sound right to you? . - : , ,

way to make;

Of Interest to Farmers.
As usual, we are the first in the field
to pay hail losses to our farmers this
season. The fields of Mr. Jake Miller
and Mr. James Ross near Hyacinth,
were struck by hail on Saturday, May
20th. On Wednesday, May 24th, we
settled these losses to the entire satis
faction of both parties. Can you beat
this for prompt settlement? If you
have not insured yet, come in and do so
before it is too late. Remember we do
not haunt you to death, but neverthe
less appreciate your business. We will
write your hail business at cash rates,
without interest. You can always find

the Domestic Science Club of the Fort
Hays NormaISchool. During the-afternoon
an automobile trip was made to

Last Sunday afternoon Mrs. Wallace,
a National" Lecturer for the W. C. T.
U., spoke to an appreciative audience
in the Baptist church. The purpose of
her visit was to organize a local V. C.
T. U. which was accomplished Mon
day afternoon. A county W. C..T. U.
was also organized. On the face of
these statements there seems to be
very little of the unusual, but when we
considered the scope of the State Na
tional and International bodies, there is
profound significance attached to it all.
The W. C. T, U. is an organization
that has accomplished more in the way
of needed reform along social, economic
and political line3 than any other single
body. We welcome the work to our
midst. We thank Mrs. Wallace for her
message and bid her Cod's richest
blessing.
Hays Ministerial Association.
The Protestant pastors of Hays, met
in the study of the M. E. church and
organized a Ministerial Association.
The Association resolved not to recom

approval of the Association. It like
wise resolved to warn all parishioners
against contributing to solicitors for
various charities, unless these collectors
show proper credentials from the State
Board of Charities, according to the
law of Kansas; because of the numer
ous frauds that have been exposed and
I because of the many legitimate appeals
that come to us.
It was decided o hold union services
during the months of July and August,

The Kindergarten.
For the first time in its history,-Hays
has a real kindergarten. About thirty
little tots are having the time of their
lives and are learning those things so
necessary to the child's development
during the pre-school "period. Miss
Bough ton of LaCrosse, Wis., who is
conducting the work, is an expert in
the work. -
. Hays is fortunate in having an edu
cational privilege enjoyed only by a
very few of the larger towns of the
state. v
The kindergarten is under the
auspices of the training department of
the Normal School.- No tuition 13
charged.
To Patrons of the Schools.
Here is something to think about. Is
it good economy to allow an expensive
school plant to stand idle two and a
half months during the year? Is it not
a waste of time and a distinct loss to
the children to have them out of school
sixteen weeks in succession?
Would it not be better to run school
at least ten months in the year and
make the work a little more strenuous?
How would it do to continue school for
ty weeks, with a week vacation about
Easter time in addition to the usual va
cations, and during the warm weather
in September and in the Spring have
shorter daily sessions for the lower
grades? The year's work coukj be
covered with less nervous strain to the
children and their development would
be more natural. Teachers are not
fond of being out of a job nearly a third
of the time and would- be willing to
take & ten months' job at very little
more than the usual salary for a nine
month3 year. I believe this plan is
worth your serious consideration.
