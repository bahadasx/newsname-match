DUPRE THINKS BILL
WILL HARM DEMOCRACY
ST. LANDRY REPRESENTATIVE C ASTS HIS BALLOT ' AGAINST
ADMINISTRATION PRIM ARYY BILL AND GIVES O
HIS REASONS F OR DOING SO
Judge Gilbert L. Dupre, in vot
ing against the administration pri
mary bill, voted the sentiments of
his people, the majority of whom
Ivoted against the democratic'nom
inee. The St. Landry representa
tive believes that if the primary
bill is enforced it will serve to drive
St. Landry out of the democratic
party, for this reason he cast his
ballot against the measure when it
came up in the Lower House of the
General Assembly on last Thurs
day.
In voting .against the bill, Mr.
Dupre said:
"Personally I cannot subscribe to
the proposed measure without a
twinge of conscience. The people
who sent me here cannot and will
not, do so. I am not by my vote
going to disclipine nor threaten
them with jail sentences.
"T'hey are, with few exceptions,
not office-holders nor ofice-seek
ers.
"They represent the bone and
sinew of my parish. Many of them
belong to the thin line of Gray, who
rode with the Wizard of the Saddle,
or who fought with Lee and Beau

Run to Appomatox. You cannot
brow beat tliem into submission.
King Caucus may govern and con
trol their descendants, but it will
never touch them. Wearing
crosses of honor and a Parker but

HAYES SAYS DOGOWNEiRS
MUST COMPLY WIITH LAW
Chief of Police Issues Warning
That He Will Kill All Dogs that
Are Nnot Muzzled
Chief of Police Clarence L. Hayes
has issued a warning to all dog
owners that the ordinance recently
adopted by the city council, rela
tive to dogs running at large, must
be complied with.
The ordinance, which was intro
duced by Alderman David Hollier,
provides that dogs, which are not
muzzled and which are found run
ning on the streets must be killed.
"I hate to have to kill a fine dog,"
said Chief Hayes. "but if that ani
mal,. no matter to whom it belongs,
is not properly muzzled, according
to law, I will have to kill it, thereby
doing my duty. I would appreciate
it if dog-owners of this city
would Save me the task of killing
their dogs."
Muzzles are obtainable almost
anywhere at very reasonable prices,
and as it is the intention of the city
officials to fully enforce the new or
dinance, those who value their dogs
highly should not delay in pur
chasing muzzles.
The ordinance is in force at pres
ert and unless all dogs are muz
zled by next week Mr. Hayes will
shoot all who come within his
sight.

"The effect of the proposed

ST. LANDRY ASSESSOR'S
INCOME TO BE REDUCED
.Fee Bill Would Put Assessor on
Salary of $3,000 With $1,500
For Office. Expenses
If the fee bill which was re
drafted and which grades assessors
and sheriffs according to parishes
is,passed, A. L. Andrus, as assessor,
will receive a salary of $3,000 per
year. with $1,500 additional for of
tlce expenses, M. L. Swords, aS
sheriff, will be given $1,500, with
$5,000 allowances for office ex
penses.
By the tentative draft of the as
sessors' bill, the companion meas
ure to the sheriffs', which ma'de its
way back to the ways and means
committee, the assessors are graded
and classified according to par
ishes, the same system basing the
adjustment on wealth and popula
tion having been used.
According to the figures the St.
Landry salary will be reduced ap
proximately $1,000. Mr. Fontenot,
as assessor, collected $5,200 for the
year 1915, his expenses against this
amount being in the neighborhood
of $2,800, thus showing that St.
Landry's new assessor will have to
be rather economical in order to
make a living out of his office.
The act placing the assessors of
Louisiana on a salary basis will be
come effective on July ist, 1917,
provided it is passed by the legis
lature.

Simon Stelly and J. P. Barnett,
two prominent and well known
cotton ginners, purchased, on last
Thursday, the Hyman-Hiller gin
plant, in this city and are having a
crew of men repair the plant for
operation this fall.
Messrs.. Stelly and Barnett are
known by practically every cotton
planter in this district and there is
no doubt that they will make a
success; both are young and indus
trious and being natural hustlers
will make a strong bid for cotton
throughout the surrounding coun
try.
The Hyman-Hiller gin is one of
the 9n:est and most modern and up
to-date.plants of its kind in the
state;. the property is very valu
able. It is understood that Messrs.
Stelly and' Barnett got the plant at
a big bargain.

BASEBALL SEASON TO
OPEN HERE SUNDAY
Opening Game Will Cfake Place at
Comeau's Park
OPELOUSAS TO TACKLE
* RAYNE TEAM TO-MORROW
Team Composed Practically of All
Home Boys to Make Its First
Apperance of the Year
The baseball season will be open
ed at Comeau's Park to-morrow af
ternoon, when Opelousas will tackle
the strong Rayne aggregation. Fi
nal organization of the Opelousas
baseball club has been perfected
with Armand L. Dejean as manager.
Mr. Dejean will give considerable
time and energy to the baseball
club, and being an old timer and at
the same time being popular with
the "boys" should make Opelousas
a splendid and efficient manager.
A portion of the season's sched
ule has been arranged. The local
boys will go to Rayne for a return
game on Sunday next. Excursions
on the Texas & Pacific will be run
for both games and a large crowd
from Rayne is expected to take in
to-morow evening's game.
On July 2, 3 and 4th Garden City
will be here for a three game se
ries. Sunday July 9th Broussard
will make its first appearance on
the local diamond, while Opelousas
will go to Broussard on the Sunday
following.
Lionel Bienvenu, crack hurler
of the Spring Hill College, Mobile,
Ala., team, will pitch for Opelousas.
The local flinger has acquired a
reputation as a reliable and effec
tive pitcher and there is no doubt
in the minds of his friends that he
will turn out to be one of the best
amateur pitchers in this portion of
the state.
One good feature of the Opelou
sas baseball club is the fact that
the team will be composed prac
tically of aill home boys, eight pf
whom are scheduled to play:. The
robabilities are that two oyitsiders
will be seen in Opelgu.asps, frfps
for the time bein. Riley Boud
reau, one of the best fielding third
basemen in this state, has been se
cured for the season. Boudreau
has a large number of friends and
admirers in this city and will no
doubt play up to his standard
throughout the season. Tete, of
Eunice, will be seen in action at
second base to-morrow evening,
but it is not known whether he will
be hired for the entire Season.
FolloWing is the line-up for t'he
Rayne game: Lionel Bienvenu, p;
Charley Dejean, C; John Brown Ib:

LOUISIANA MAN HONORED
BY NATIONAL PROGRESSIVES
Jehn M. Parker Is Selected As
Choice of Convention for Vice
President of United States
John M. Parker, the progressive
candidate for governor in the re
cent memorable gubernatorial fight
in this state, was selected by ac
:clamation by the national progres
sive convention as their candifdato
for vice president of the United
States.
T'he many local friends and po
litical admirers of John. M. Parker
rejoice at the fact that progressives
from every section of the Union
reached way down South, in a state,
which is considered the bailliwick
of the'democratic party,- to se-
lect their choice for the second
place on their national ticket.
Mr. Parker has always been a
staunch friend of Teddy Roosevelt,
who was chosen as the progressive
candidate for president, but who
refuses to make the race; his abil
ity was not doubted by his fellow-
progressives so there was no op
position to his candidacy for the
vice presidential nomination. Mr.
Parker did not have any intention
of making the race for the nomina
tion and in fact, according to his
own statement did note cu'e to be
nominated.
Since Mr. Roosevelt has declined
to make the race for president on
the progressive ticket there was
some' talk of making Parker the
running mate of Justice Hughes,
who was chosen as the standard
bearer of the republican party.
The Louisianian, however, has pos
Itively refused to run as a repunb
lican, claiming that he would be
inconsistent to the promise he
made those who supported him in
the recent gubernatorial campaign.
PARADE FEATURE OF
FLAG DAY EXERCISES
OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WITNESS "PREPAREDNESS
PARADE" OF OPELO USAS EL KS ON
WEDNESDAY NIGHT
Over fifteen hundred people wit
nessed the mamihoth "preparedness
parade" pulled off by the local
Elks, on Wednesday flight, as part
of their Flag Day exercises.
The parade, which was headed by
the Opelousas brass band, with the
Scout Boys, carrying flags and
lanterns, followed by 16 pretty
school girls, dressed in red, white
,and blue and carrying lanterns, af
ter whom walked the Elks, groomed
in white trousers, black coats and
colonial .hats, was easily the feature
of the Wednesday night exercises,
conducted by the Opelousas Elks.
The paraders started from the
Elks Home on Main Street, going to
Landry to Market to Bellevue and
from thence back to the home. As
the night was cool and the weather
ideal the streets through which the
paraders passed were crowded with
people from the surrounding coun
try, who were there at eight o'clock
to witness the parade.
After arriving at the home the
Elks proceeded to fill their pre
arranged program, which was wit
nessed by over five hundred per
sons. The exercises were conduct

BATON ROUGE PLANNING
* PREPAREDNESS PARADE
State Capital to Have U. S. Sea
Fighters for July Fourth
Demonstration
Baton Rouge, June 13.-A United
States man-o'war anchored in the
harbor here, and a great prepared
ness parade through the streets of
the city will be the feature of the
Fourth of July celebration at the
capital, if plans of the committee
carry. Of the preparedness parade.
Phere is no doubt as the plans for
it are well under way,, and one of
the big fighters of Uncle Sam's
navy will be here if it is anything
like a feasible proposition on the
part of the government.
That it is quite probable that a
United States war vessel will be in
port here on July 4 is shown by a
!olegram received from Governor
Pleasant, and members of the comn
mibtee from Senator Broussard.
The committee in charge sent
telegrams to Senators Ransdell and
Broussard and also Congressman
Morgan, telling them of the extens
sive plans for the Fourth of July
celebration, and urging them to
use their best offices in securing the
government's consent to send a sea
fighter to Baton Rouge.
Cannons have been received from
New Orleans and a complete com
plement of competent gunners will
be sent here to man the gu: i.
It is confidently expected that the
"preparedness parade" will be the
largest yet held in the country; the
size of the city being taken into
consideration.
Governor Pleasant will be-the or
ator of the day and the General As
sembly has recognized the event by
appointing a live committee from
both branches of the legislature to
work with the local committee to
the end of making the coming
'Fourth of July a banner day in the
history of Baton Rouge.
The night features of the celel
bration will be a display of fire
works and a grand ball.
Railroads entering Baton Rouge,
-Iaving made a concession in the
way of rates, it is expected that
there will be a large attendance
from practically every parish in
Louisiana.
