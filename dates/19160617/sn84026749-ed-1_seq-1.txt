Members of the Marine Band, the nation's crack musical organiza
tion, are up in arms over tho'provisions of the new army reorganiza
tion law, which cuts them off entirely from outside employment and
compels them to rely wholly upon Government pay.
Several members of the band have expressed their intention of
leaving the organization sines their outside pay is cut off.
Thus far there have been no desertions, but Marine Corps officers
believe that some musicians whose services have been most in demand
will leave the band.

further efforts to get Colonel
Roosevelt and Charles Evans
Hughes together appeared to be in
progress here today. They took the
form of a conference this after
noon between Hughes and Gen.
Leonard Wood, stanch friend of
Roosevelt.
As an army nan, Wood cannt.t
battle in politics. There is nothing
to prevent him however, from be
ing a personal emissary bctweea
the two men, and it is believed he
will add his voice to that of other
men who hope to see Roosevelt
with his coat off working for the
Republican nominee;
Hughes' day was quiet. In the
forenoon he made a trip downtown
to purchase more of his famous
open-faced collars and dignified
four-in-hand ties, white waistcoats,
and other haberdashery.
HUGHES TALKS POLITICS.
During the afternoon Hughe renewed
hla conferences' with Republican leader.
Including Congressman - Stephens tit
California. Senator Work of California.
Congressman Austin of Tennessee, For
mer Senator Bntler of Northr Carolina,
and Congressman Madden of Chicago.
Mr. Hughes, who arrived In Wash
ington la.it night, almost succeeded In
starting his week-end here aa plain
"Cltlren Hughes.V
He didn't succeed entirely, for Con
gressmen and Senators besieged him.
They wanted to tell him how glad they
were over his nomination, to whisper
how they'd always been early and high
on the Hughes' band wagon, and to
promise active work "back home."
Hughes was pleased, not alone with
their words, but with the assurances
from every corner' of the land during
his first week of shaping up tho cam
paign. Especially gratifying was the an
nouncement by Qorgo w. Perkins, an
gel of the Progressives, that peace par
leys are looking up. Hughes was not
itrnrtMrf. tar Indeed much Of the
week's work in Now York has been de
voted to a tunellng process, whereby
sooner of 'iter Hughes and Colonel
Roosevelt could get together.
For "Mental" Get Together.
Thos-j close to Hushes say such a.
meeting will not occur before the noti
fication In July, though before then the
two may have a'"mentnl" get together.
Hughes undoubtedly Intends such a
"blast" In his forthcoming acceptance
of tho nomination that Roosevelt can
well afford to come out openly In his
support. Republican leaders say.
The Republlcnn campaign shaped up
today about thus:
Hughes hns control.
Ho apparently will tako little or no
Old Guard dictation.
He has Inspired leaders ovor the
country by his action In losing no time.
Ho has an organization already at
work In many parts of the land.
Hughes' time here toda was devoted
to his family, to a few calle:s, and to

The provision of tho army jrearganl
zatlon bill complained of was Inserted
at the Instance of the Musicians' Union.
It provides that hereafter no member
of the band shall be permitted to leave
his post to fill any engagement to nlay
when he might compete with civilian
musical organizations.
The result of this new law, which Is
now In effect. Is to keep members of
tho' band from giving music lessons,
from appearing In private concerts, or
as soloists at receptions or other social
affairs. It also prevents the band from
holding Its annual concert tour, which
has been a national musical event for
years.
Tlie law does not prevent the tppear
anre of the band at White House re
ceptions or park concerts, as ordors for
appearance at such events are given
as n part of their duties.

COURT ROOM. WAUKEOAN, Ill
June 17. The "'eighteen bunch" had
their Inning In the game for the life
or death If Will Orpet today.
The "bunch" now only sixteen strong
are school girls, chums of Marian, and
they came into the big court room half
laughing, half frightened, and took the
stand, one after another, to aid the
prosecution of the youth who wrecked
the life of Ihelr-friend.
They had been In court before but
this was their day-the day they wore
to refute the story of Josephine Davis,
now ostracized from 'the bunch." who
said Marian had cried and threatened
suicide on the day of her eighteenth
birthday party, four days before her
body was found.
Bernice Wells Called.
Dernlce Wells was called first to the
stand.
"Did you see Marian go with Joseph
ine Davis In any other room on the af
ternoon of the birthday party!" the
prosecutor asked.
"I did not."
"Did you see her crying?"
"No."
"Did you see anyone crying at that
birthday party?" she was asked.
"Yes " said Florence. "Anna Paulson
was crying.
"Anvnnft ae?"
"Yes. Marian Lambert. They were
crying together.
..ivh.i Hiit Marian and Anna say? '
"Marian sold 'Anna. I'm awfully sorry
you didn't arrange to stay all night
with me. We have not missed staying
together on my birthday for fifteen
years.' ' .......
"What that nil she was crying about7
"Yes."
The State turned Miss Russell over
to the defenso for cross-examination.
Told of Betrothal.
"Marian told me Sunday morning,
February 6, that she had learned Will
Orpet was engaged to Miss Youker, and
that Josephine had written Will and
soon Will would come down and tell
her the straight truth of It." Miss Rus
sell said. c..
On re-dlrcct examination tho state

and had slept in mo kbi-hro "

saia, no wouia pci umu ., m
Into a temper. "Marian said she liked
him that .way."
The Awaited Testimony
Then Miss Russell sprang the testi
mony tho State had waited for.
"Marian," she said, "told me once
that she thought Josephine Davis liked
Will Orpet awfully well, but rlan
said sne aiani care ui uw
thought that It was Josephine s
ing for Orpet that made her col
.kA T..mh.,l ttnmA an often.'
Marian also had told her, sho said,
fhat her parents did not want Orpet
to come to her home,
Minnie Rumsey was the next of the
"eighteen bunch" called. She had
known Marian Intimately for three
years, she said, and Marian always
seemed happy.
Declaring that the State has fail
ed In every attempt to connect Will
Orpet with the murder of Marlam
Lambert,, counsel for the defense In
Orpefs v trial today announced they
would ask- Judge Charles H. Donnelly
to tako the case from the pury the
minute the Stato has finished Its evi
dence. James in Wllkerson, senior counsel
for Orpet made announcement follow
ing an unsuccessful attempt to secure
a delay In proceedings of the trial until
Monday In order to prepare briefs and
arguments for dismissal.
"I will promise to reduce the length
of the trial six days If court will ad
journ until Monday morning," Wllker
son said.
Judge Donnelly refused.
Celesta Youker to Testify.
As court opened today It was re
ported that Celesta Youker, the girl to
whom Orpet was engaged had changed
her mind and was ready to take the
stand for the State.
This decision was reached. It was
saia, wncn .state's Attorney Dady prom
ised that If rtie admitted her engage
ment love-letters she wrote Orpet would
not be Introduced in evidence. Dady
needed her testimony, ho said, to es
tablish beyond a doubt what he consid
ered Orpet's motive for desiring to do
nwny with Marian.
Judge Donnelly was to rule todny on
admissibility of ovldenro by Percy
Longland. an assistant to E. C. Orpet,
father of the defendnnt, on the Kup
penhclmer estato at I.ake Forest.
Lonpluid Is to be a witness for the
defense, but Dady has demanded that
lie bo produced ns a Stnto's witness to
testify regarding a quantity of cyanide
of potassium destroyed on thu Kup
pcuhelmer estate n few days after Mar
rlnn's death. .
This cyanide, the Rtate contends, was
destroyed at tne older orpet's oraers,
Finish Expert Testimony.
Tho State was about through with Its
"chemistry class today. All of the ex
pert testimony tending to show that
cynnlde In a llnuld form caused Mar-
rlan's death, has hon concluded.
Dady planned to wage his efforts
now toward controverting 'Josephine
uavis- testimony mat Marion was ae
snondent and threatened to commit suicide.
Marian's mother, who sobbed ns she
said Marian seemed happy before her
death, was Dndy's witness late yester
day. Srhoolfrlends of Marian's wcro

If Mr. Hughes Is Elected
Next to the President himself public interest places his family, and, with
the prospective probability that Mr. Hughes will receive the greater number of
votes next November, The Sunday Times, with the permissldn of Mrs. Hughes,
will publish an intimate story of the Hughes household, its likes and dislikes,
its tastes and its fireside, customs. The story will appear
In Tomorrow's Sunday Times
The United States faces war'
with Mexico, if it moves a single
soldier farther into Mexico, or
sends any re-enforcements across '
the border to General Pershing.
Through Gen. Jacinto Trevino,
commanding the Mexican forces in
northern Chihuahua, General Car
ranza has served plain warning on
the United States that any move
ment of the kind will be regarded
as an act of hostility, and treated
as such.
Official confirmation of this was
received at the War Department

MAY MAKE GOOD.
But for the desperate situation In
which Carranza finds himself, with hi
government tottering and his only hope
seeming to lie In defying the United
States, officials here would be Inclined
to regard thfi threat as a characteristic
Mexican bluff. As It Is, they believe tt
possible that Carranza may try to malco
good on his threat.
The Mexican embassy today branded
the published text of the Trevino mea-sage-tf
Trevino actually did aond one

has not been Informed that any mes

by Trevino was "possible."

Large Force Stationed.
At this pass, long regarded by Fun
ston and Pershing ns a danger point.
totireatenlng Pershing's line of com
munications, a largo American force la
stationed.
At Douglas. Ariz., tn the west of tha
west of the mountain chain and ac
cessible to tho weitern and of tho
pass, are concentrated all six batteries
of tho Sixth Field Artillery. So long aa
this strategical point is guardoed
army officers here feel secure against
any surprise attack on Pershing's line.
Tho force which Pershing has can
only bo approximated as being some
where between 1S.0OO and 15,00o men. A
rigid censorship that has' existed ever
since, the troop." crossed the line has
prevented the real numbers for ever
becoming known.
Army officials are entirely confident
thnt If Trevino nttacks, Pershing will
glvo a good account of himself, and
will keep the Mexicans engaged suffi
ciently Ions for American re-enforcements
to got to thn scene.
Movements to Continue.
It Is declared flatly, moreover, that
Trevlno's threat to the contrary not
withstanding, Pershing will continue to
move his troops ns he sees fit, and new
expeditions will bo sent over the border
as often aa new raids occur.
The new developments have again
caused a delay in the dltpatch of the
ernorshlp lights In New York State,. nnd
for that reason the Democratic leaders
are strongly of tho opinion that tho
President should go on tne stump.
Harmony Augurs Well.
The President nnd his advisers feel
that the complete harmony which char
acterized the Democratic convention
augurs well for tho campaign; and hopo
beats high In the breasts of the Presi
dent's friends that thcro will be enough
soreness left In tho ranks of tho Pro
gressives to guarantee tho much
needed assistance from that quarter.
Efforts on tho purt of dcorgo W. Per
kins and other Progressive leaders to
bring about a icconcilatlon with the O.
O. P. are being watched by tho White
Houso with cor.vldcrablo Interest, and.
In other Democratic quarters, with un
easiness. The Democrats will make no effort to
win. thn Uerman-Amcricnn voto to
their standard. The hyphenate plank
In the St. Louis platform was inserted
urith thn deliberate knowledge that it
would probably serve to completely
alienate tho cltlzons of German oxtrac-
At' thn unmis time It Is felt that the
strongest aid which the President could
have would bo an Impres slon tn the
minds of tho voters of tho country
that the Republican candidate It the
candidate of thevOcrman-Amcrlcnns. It
Is the purpose throughout the cam
paign to hammer on the fact that the
German-American Alliance and prnctl
cally all tho Oermnn-Amorlcnn publica
tions in this country havo Indorsed Jus
tice Hughes.
Newsdealers Warned.
The attitude adopted by former Sec
retary of State Bryan In Indorsing the
President at St. Louts Is expected by
Democrats to be n valuable asset, antj
It goes without saying that the Com
moner will be asked to stump tho coun
try for the President.
Arrangements for tho formal notifi
cation to tho President of his renoml
nation aro being held up pending the
plana of the Itepubllcans regarding tho
notification of Justice Hughes. Tho
President's advisers aro anxious that
