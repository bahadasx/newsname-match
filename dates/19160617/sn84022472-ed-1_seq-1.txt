A modification of the sweeping in

was denied by Judge Webb of the su
perior court in a decision handled
down today. The court said- he could
not properly grant such a motion as
the injunction granted by Judge Gar
ger was temporary and remained in
force only until the suit brought by
the Max Ams Co. against the Inter
national Association of Machinists was
tried in the superior court.
Arguments for and against the mo
tion were heardi yesterday afternoon.
Attorney Hugh La very, representing
the machinists, said the men were de
prived of -their lawful rights by the
mandate which enjoined them from
loitering or gathering in the vicinity
of the plant or interfering in any way
with employes." Attorney Lavery
contended that the strikers' had the
right to talk to employes so long am
no threats of violence were used and
were also entitled to the privilege of
loitering in the street near the plant
if nothing unlawful was done.
Attorney Ralph O. Wells of . Hart
ford, representing the) Max Ams Co.?
said the strikers had conspired to in
jure the company's business and that
under the circumstances the injunc
tion had not been too sweeping.

several years. Thus the two had been
saparated for years. On Decoration

ers of Business
(Special to The Farmer.)
Fairfield, June 17. As an apprecia
tion of the long service of his former
employes, E. W. Harral, former presi
dent of the Fairfield Rubber Co.,
which was sold last week to the Du-
Pont interests, presented them with
gifts, ranging from $250 down to $15,
this morning.
All the older employes of the rubber
works were given cash tokens of Mr.
Harral's appreciation. His foreman,
who has been with the company for
28 years, received five crisp $50 bills.
None of the men was slighted. "
Mr. Harral and A, d Wheeler, for
mer treasurer of ythe plant, made their
last visit to the .'factory this morning,
to take leave of the men, many of
whom have worked for them the best
years of their life. Mr. Harral had in
tended! to speak a few words to . the
men, but he was so affected by the
leave-taking that he was unable to
express the sentiments he Intended.
The occurrence had the same effect
on the men, who had. grown to admire
and. respect their employer immeas-
4 urably during the years they worked
for him. Coupled with the knowledge
that he appreciated -their efforts, and
had. made provision that a change in
ownership would not discontinue the
advantages of fellowship they had en
joyed!, his departure caused a deep
sense of loss to permeate the plant.
The Fairfield Rubber Co. employes
will be eligible to pensions, under the
DuPont system. This was one of the
stipulations of Mr. Harral and his as
sociates before they would sell the
business.
WILLIAMS QUITS
ELECTRICIAN JOB;
WON'T TAKE CUT
Policeman Refuses to Work
As Lineman for Fire De
partment at Less Pay
Unwilling to work for a lower sal
ary for the Are department than he
had been receiving in the police de
partment, former Electrician Thomas
Williams resigned last night. At the
meeting of the police board Thursday
night,' he was ordered to report to
the fire alarm superintendent who
now has charge of both police and
fire electrical systems.
Williams as department electrician
for the police has been receiving
$3.25 a day and has had entire charge
of the police signal system. When the
common council recently voted to
combine the positions of police elec
trician and superintendent of fire
alarm telegraph, it was stated that
Williams was to be employed by the
fire department. - -
When Williams reported to Super
intendent Arthur Piatt, he was told
to go out and work as a lineman. He
refused. " In order to work in the
fire department it is necessary for the
electricians to be members of the de
partment but Williams is said to have
been ineligible for membership
among the fire fignters.
As the pay of a lineman is but
$2.75 a day and Williams would not
accept the cut, he tendered his resig
nation last evening and Is no longer
connected with the, department.
Williams succeeded Sheridan A.
Ladd as police electrician- about two
years ago when the Gamewell alarm
system was introduced into the de
partment. He had been . previously
employed by the Gamewell Company
and also by the S. N. E. Telephone
Company.
Since the wires for both the police
and fire systems have been run un
derground in the same conduits, trou
ble has arisen and because of the dual
system, the officials have been unable
to ascertain the blame for any trou
ble. But with one person in charge
of both departments it is believed
that this trouble will be alleviated.

Only One Agent, in Mexico City, Now Represents
United States In Mexican Territory Tre
vino's Warning is That Any Movement of

Laredo, Tex., June 17 Philip C. Hanna, United States consul
general at Monterey, and one of the two remaining American
consuls in Mexico, accompanied by half a dozen other Ameri
cans, arrived here today. He was reticent as to the object of
his visit. x
Asked regarding conditions in Mexico and the probable
length of his stay, Consul Hanna replied:
"Everything is quiet down the line. I may remain two or
three days." ;
It has been known for some time that Consul Hanna was
instructed by the state department that he could leave his post
at any time at his own discretion.
Due probably to the vigilance of Texas Rangers and mili
tary patrols, the reported dash by Mexican bandits at Tslitas,
S.5 miles northwest of here, early today, did not materialize,"
according to reports to General Mann, commanding the border
patrol here.
San Antonio, Tex., June 17 The arrival at Laredo today,
of 'Phillip Hanna, consul-general at Monterey, developed th5
fact that the state department ordered both him and J. H. Silli-
man, consul at Saltillo, to the American side of the river.
The withdrawal of these two consular officers will leave
the American government with no consular representatives at
inferior points in Mexico except an agent at Mexico City. '

THREE BANDITS KILLED IN CLASH
WITH TROOPS IN LOWER RIO GRANDE
Brownsville, June 17. Revival of
bandit activity in the lower Rio
Grande valley last night resulted in
vigorous action by authorities, which)
was interpreted today here as presag
ing a determined attempt to nip the
periodical recurrence of outlawry in
the bud by dealing with the marauders
in American soil.
Soon after reports were received by
bandits appeared near San Benito,
several detachments of troops were
sent, to deal with them. Motor cars
were commandeered in - accordance
with pre-arranged plans and: two com
panies of the 26th infantry were dis
patched . from Harlingen to Olmito, 10
miles north, of Brownsville, with orB
ders to cut off the bandits' retreat
across the Rio Grande into Mexico.
Meanwhile, another force of two com
panies of infantry sent from, San Ben
ito earlier in the night to investigate
reports that the Joe Scott ranch had
been attacked found their quarry ten
milea .east of San Benito. :
A running fight took place in which.
according to meagre reports available
here, three Mexicans were killed while

General Funston reported also that
Major Gray, of the 14th cavalry com
manding two troops attacked by Mex
icans at San Ignacio, Tex., recently
had turned from an effort to pick up
the trail of the bandits. The oavl-
the American force suffered no cas

a Mexico farmer of his horses. The
men escaped unharmed and reported
