THE ATTACK ON GOV. HALL
The attack on Gov. Hall deserves to be character
ized as vicious,'as a disgrace to men who in the ordinary
walks of life would%ot be ä party to any such questionable
methods, yet in politics they do not hesitate while their
course serves their ends.
• ••• * * * *
Here is a man who served the State at a sacrifice of
near $50,000, hampered by the meanest of conspiracies
bred in his own party for no other purpose than that of de
stroying him. Luther E. Hall is a gentleman of unblem
ished character, and, save for political ends, his character
has never been attacked. _ N . 0 . American.*.

Fresh from hi3 victory over
Frankie Brown, of New York, Pete
Herman, the Southern bantam pu
gilistic champion, will go a ten
round boxing contest with Kid Kel
ly, at Suthon's Park, tomorrow.
"Kid" Kelly has a reputation as wide

sport are looking forward to one of
the most spectacular fights ever
witnessed in Louisiana.
The fight will be staged at the
large skating rink at Suthon's
Park, which has been fitted up with
the ring platform and seats.
This will be Pete Herman's first
appearance in Houma as a pugilist,
but Houma people remember him
well, as Houma is his native town,
and lived here until a few years ago.
After he left Houma he went strong
into athletics and soon won his
spurs ia the pugilistic world. It was
through many a hard and brilliant
fight *laat Herman finally won the
Southern Bantam championship,
and a few days ago he defeated
Frankie Brown, of New York.
Seats will be sold at the following
prices: side chair seats, 7f> cents;

Bourgeois Arouses Police Jury to
Need ot More Aid in Splendid
Appeal in Behalf of
Public Schools
Stating that the future of four
thousand children of this parish was
involved in the need of longer school
terms, Superintendent H. L- Bour
geois made a strong plea before the
Police Jury last Wednesday for an
additional mill to be set aside out of
the Parish taxes for school purposes.
He said that the time had come
when it was up to the people to de
cide whether or not the school sys
tem should remain stationery or
whether it should go forward, that
if the school system of this parish is
to keep abreast of the progress made
and being made by the parishes
more advanced along educational
lines, they must be prepared to pay
for a nine months' term in all the
ward parishes, and to pay the teach
ers as much as the more advanced
parishes are paying them.
He cited one or two instances
where the school system here is
about to lose the services of compe
tent teachere because other parishes
have offered them better salaries.
He said that it is always best for the
school system to avoid changing
teachers, when those teachers are
Terrebonne Truck Sold at Curb
stone Markets by New Orleans
Housewives' League, Brings
Good Price to Farmers
The work of the Housewives' Lea
handled
The work of the Housewives' Lea
gue in New Orleans, in the creation
of so called "curb stone markets" in
several localities in the city, may
prove a great boon to the truck
growers of Terrebonne Parish.
According to information furnish
ed Miss Kate Minor, representative
of the League in this Parish, the
first shipment of Terrebonne truck
from Mr. Felioan Duplantis' farm
above Houma, to the Housewives'
League, was received last Tuesday,
in excellent condition, and was sold
at a good price. A letter from Mrs.
W. O. Hayward, purchasing agent
for the League, expressed the grat
ification of the League at th<> excel
lent condition and quality of the
products shipped from Terrebonne.
Mr. W. T. Cobb, Parish Agricul
tural Agent, is cooperating with
Miss Minor in getting the truck
growers to ship to the Housewives'
League, and they have received full
eat assurances from the Wells
Fargo Express Co. of that company's
desire to aid the movement by giv
ing low express rates on truck from
Houma to New Orleans, and in the
despatch and delivery of the goods
at the markets.
The League has established these
"curbstone markets" at two place's
in New Orleans, one on Magazine
and the other on Prytania Streets,
and is planning to establish them in
other parts of the city later on. The
two already started are proving to
be wonderful successes. The veg
etables are received direct from the
country daily by the Housewives'
League, and sold at these two sta
tions, by which arrangement the
customer is saved the exhorbitant
profit which the regular markets
have made, only a reasonable profit
being made to defray the expenses
of handling the goods and maintain
ing the League as a marketing or
anization. The vegetables are
Buy it in Houma
A salesman was taking an order for some tire covers the other
day, which we sell at about $2.00 each. A customer who was
standing by spoke up—-"I can get the same thing from Chicago for
$1.48." "Yes," said the salesman, "I can sell you these tire covers
for $1.48, too, and ship them to you C. O. D. But it will cost you
40 cents express, 2 cents for stamps, 10 or 20 cents return charges
on the money, and you will wait a week or two for the goods."
There is more satisfaction in seeing what you buy than in or
dering from a catalog. And you'll get just as much for your money
with our SERVICE thrown in.
When you don't see the tires you are buying, you have the
trouble of waiting, the cost of express and the possibility that af
ter all it's not what you want.
And if-, as frequently happens, the tire you buy outside later
blows out, you have to send it away in an effort to get it adjusted.
More trouble—more expense—more delay.
We're here to save you these things; to give you what you want
when you want it, and to stand back of it with our own as well aai:
the maker's guarantee. These tires we sell are cheaper for you
the end.
Come in and see for yourself.
Cordially yours,
HOUMA RETAIL CO. INC.
competent. "A competent and ex
perienced teaching force, trained in
the working of the school system,
with a thorough knowledge of con
ditions prevailing, gives 'team
work,' " he said, "that makes your
school system strong and effi
cient."
He urged, the Police Jury to set
aside another mill for school pur
poses, giving five mills instead of
four as it is now giving. "I know
that you have expenses to meet that
will tax your ability to do so," he
said, "and I wish to say that this
Parish has been very generous in
giving four mills in the past, while
other parishes are only giving three,
but I appeal to you, not in my own
behalf, but in behalf of four thous
and school children whose future is
at stake, to give us an extra mill
and let us have longer terms and
a bigger teaching force—put Terre
bonne in the front rank of the Par
ishes that have made educational ad
vancement in Louisiana—do this for
the sake of the children of today,
the men and women of the future."
handled by the ladies themselves,
composing the League, and by them
are sold direct to the customers.
Mrs. Henry B. Myer is President,
and Mrs. W. O. Hayward is purchas
ing agent, with headquarters at
1539 Louisiana Avenue.
Miss Minor and Mr. Cobb are go
ing to New Orleans next week to
confer with Commissioner of Agri
culture Harry D. Wilson with a
view of forming in Terrebonne> a
shipping organization. Mr. Wilson
has already expressed his sympathy
with the movement and promises
full Cooperation.
Miss Minor desires to have truck
growers know that they may find
a ready market, with the advantage
of special express rates and the
minimum cost of marketing, for
their truck, by getting in touch with
Mr. Cobb.
The Housewives' League is a Na
tional organization, and has for its
object the federation of housewives
of America for the betterment of
conditions in the cities, and the low
ering of the high cost of living.
