LONDON, June IT. As a result of
the discussion of the blockade at the
recent allied conference In Paris con
clusions were reached which will re
move many misconceptions on the part
of neutrals, according to Lord Cecil,
minister of war, who attended the
Conference as a British representative.
What these conclusions were, Lord
Robert would not say, nut he asserted
there would be "no slackening" of the
blockade and that It would work bet

Local Man Believes
He Has Good Field
For Industry Here
GROWTH OF FLOUR iusixesjs
PREDICTED BY BLYDEN
sTEIX MANUFACTURER.
That he may be able to build up
a very important local industry is the
belief of H. G Blydensteln. former
manager of the Pendleton Roller
Mills who is engaged In manufactur
ing a self-rising flour and a dietary
flour. The names of the products
are Blydsnateln'a Self Rising Pastry
Flour and Hl denstetn's Prepared Di
etary Flour.
The self rising pastry flour Is used
for the making of pies, cakes, waf-
ries. hot cakes and biscuits. It has
already been tried out and found
highly satisfactory. For campers'
use, the flour Is a great boon as it
may be used by being merely mixed
with water. The pastry flour is not
used In making light bread.
At the present time Mr. Blyden
steln Is equipped In p. moderate way
for the manufacture of his flour but
he hopes In the future to build up an
extensive business, requiring a large
plant The field is open for this bus
iness In the west as such products are
not being manufactured here though
there are a number of such plants In
the eust.

tary Lansing was today con)idering
bringing from Mexico the remainder
of the American consuls in the amah
cities. Moat of them returned sev
eral weeks ago for the border con
ference and have not gone back.
The war department received pri
vate advices today saying that notices
were posted in Chihuahua and Jua
rez urging the civilians to supply
themselves with arms and ammuniti
on. The department transmitted the
dispatches to Wilson.
Lansing was admittedly anxious to
learn whether Trevino was acting un
der Carranza's orders in sending a
note to Pershing. The Mexican em
bassy branded the published text of
the Trevino message as a fake. War
department officials belittled Trevl
no's message it is doubted if the text
of It as printed in the morning pa
pers is correct. Bell's message did not
quote Pershing directly.
Bell today denied official knowledge
of the alleged I'arranza threat to at
tack Americans. A tightening of the
American communication lines was
reported as a precaution against Car
ranza attacks along the 2S0 mils
front.
The Mexican embassy criticized
"certain army officer" who circulat
ed unfounded stories.
