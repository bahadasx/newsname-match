THE Republican can-
didate for president
H has never been a favor
H ite with the men of the
H far west.
H' There has been a
H feeling that when his
H Baptist parents had him
H baptized, either the
H -ater, hot at the start,
m was frozen by him and
H he had to be cut out of
H the ice, or that they
H d o u s'e d him into ice
M water and he has never
H been warm since. They
M have unconsciously
M been recalling the pic
m i tures of the last gener
al ation of the sad-faced,
M but great-hearted Lin
M coin; the magnetic,
m knighty Blaine; the im
H perious and proud, but
H always aggressive and
H o u t-spolcen American,
H Conkling; the fiery, im
H passioned all-compelling
B Baker; the thoughtful,
H masterful Moreton, and
H the others that were
H wont to sway senates,
Hj and give to their coun
H tryman glimpses of
H what their country
H really was and what it
H soon would be if the
H people were great
H enough to manage wise
H ly the mighty inherit
H a n c e bequeathed t o
H them by the fathers;
H 'and as Hughes has
H 'seemed to them, he was
H austere but a faithful
H . plodder, like the steam
Hj engine that takes a
K huge steamship out of
K port, out over the har-
ibor bar, out against the
winds and storms, out
m over raging seas to a
M destined port without
H once changing its
H steady stroke.
H When the convention
H met last week in Chica-
H go and the time came
H for nominating candi-
H dates, the minds of the
1 "ir.west were filled with
jH the memories of Inger-
tB sol's speech nominating
1 J Blaine, and of that mar-
HH veloue triumph of Conk-
H ling's when, after fac-
B ing a hostile conven-

GIIARLBS WILSON NIBLEY, born in a small coal mining village of Hunterilold, just out of
Edinburg, Scotland, February 5th, 1849, and brought by his parents to the United States
when six years of age, would be an out and nut American except for some tenacious
Scotch instincts and traits that cannot be bred out of a Scotchman in a single generation.
Among these are the sagacity to see an opportunity; the instinct to seize it at the right moment;
the tenacity of purpose to cling to a design until it is worked out, and the courage to face opposition
and grapple with it until it is finally beaten down. The Nibleys are an old Scotch family, the record
of which for the past two hundred and fifty years kept in Edinburg, makes them farmers, or "por
tainers" attached to the soil near Elphiuetone, Scotland, for several generations.
Mr. Nibley's father, Charles Nibley, born about 1810, was a coal minor in the little village of
Huntsfield, eigh miles out of Edinburg, where he married Jean Wilson, who was born June 18th, 1815.
The father is described as a "natural wit," a quiet, God-fearing, hard-working, inoffensive man," while
the mother Is described as "all energy, and push and Scotch thrift, a tireless worker, and deeply relig
ious woman."
In 1855, hearing from a married sister in Rhode Island, that wages wore good there in the woolen
and cotton mills, the family, in the spring of 1855, sailed in the sail ship "Dreadnought" for New

half harp and half H

And in twenty minutes, H
without in the least sur- H

had tried to drown him H
out jumping like luna- H
tics upon the benches H
and yelling for Conk- H
ling and Grant. Noth- H
ing echoed from Chica-
go last week was an IH
echo of those earlier IH
speeches. H
The nearest approach H
to them was the brief, 1
indignant speech by 11
Governor Johnson of IH
California in the Fro- 11
gressive convention. 11
But the stalwarts of fll
the Republican conven- 11
t i o n rode like the 11
steamship, cited above,
through the gales and 11
angered seas of the 11
convention to the fin- M
ish, that brought to "e M
people as the chosen M
candidate for president, H
Charles Evans Hughes. H
And now who is he? H
We only know that ho lH
was a precocious boy, H
fond of study from the H
beginning, that he won H
prize after prize in H
school; that ho gradu- H
ated with distinguished H
honors; that he never H
accepted aught but ex- nl

he has always made B
good. His first real IH
