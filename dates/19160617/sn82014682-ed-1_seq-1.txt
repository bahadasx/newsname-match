DR. SCUDDER MAY LEAVE CENTRAL
UNION AI TAKE PULPIT IN JAPAN
Tokio Union Church in Corres
pondence With Pastor; He
is Considering Change ,
Tn. Doremus Scudder, pastor for the
last; nine years . of " Central . Union
church of this city, is in correspond
ence with officials of the Tokio Union
church, Tokio, Japan, and though no
final arrangements nor decisions have
been made, the local minister is giv
ing his earnest consideration' to ac
cepting a position aa pastor there.
Interest which Dr. Scudder nas taa
en in the Japanese question for many
vears. experience of six years' in
Japan, knowledge of the language, and
success In ministerial work have com
bined to place him In what Is practi
cally considered a call from Tokio. V
Definite Decision-not Reached.
"We have not reached any decision
In" the matter as yet," said Dr. Scud
der today, "and I have not been ap
pointed to the position, but I have
been in correspondence with the
church authorities there for some
time,' and hava given considerable
thought to the matter. !
"Mrs. Scudder and I are to leave
this week for a vacation of two
months on the mainland, and we shall
probably not decide as to this step un
til our return to Honolulu. In any
case, we should not hurry .our going,
and would give the local church time
to adjust itself to the change."
Service Here Long.
Dr. Scudder has the distinction of
having served in Central Union church
longer than any other pastor, a peri
od of nme years this coming October.
He ha3 been in Honolulu for 13 years.
Six years of his life before coming
to Honolulu were -spent in Japan as
a missionary under the American
board, mostly at the city of Niigata.
He is also well acquainted with To
kio and has many frknds there both
among Japanese and Ilrgllsh-s peaking
people.
Combines Several Churches.
"The church in Tokio is very simi
lar to Central Union church," said the
doctor today. "It combines all of the
English-speaking churches in ihe city.
Though it is not large numerically, its
influence in the Christian movement
throughout Japan is very broad.
1 "I should enjoy the work there very
tmuch," continued the doctor. "Japan
has always had a great fascination for
me, and the life there would. be de
lightful. "There is no use crossing bridges
before we get to thera, however. nd
until a . completed offer is made we

Dr. Scudder" Work Valuable. ?:'Y
Missionaries, teachers from the big
schools of Tokio. and . American and
English business men of - larger call
ber, mike up the congregation of the
Tokio ehurch. Undoubtedly Dr.: Scud
der V almost widening fame in Japa
nese affairs has led them to consider
him for the place of pastor.
Two years ago he was ; loaned by
the local church to the Federal Coun
cil of the Churches of Christ, and
spent two months of hard work on
the mainland on the Japanese immi
gration question. His belief fn the
Japanese, ardently given to leading
men of the nation, placed him prom
inently before the public through some
of the largest newspapers and maga
zines of the East' t' -Though
most of his work was in
Interviews with influential leaders of
the country, he also spoke in public
on several occasions. His work was
carried on in such cities aa New York,
Boston, Washington, New Haven,
Springfield, San Francisco and Los

In the present visit to the mainland
the Scidders will go as far as Maine,
visiting in varioi's cities of the main
land. . - - , ;
