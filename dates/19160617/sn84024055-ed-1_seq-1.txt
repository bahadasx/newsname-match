The actions or the proceedings of
the Republican National Convention
has now passed into history and time
alone will tell whether or not it acted
wisely in selecting its standard bearers
for 191G, as predicted in these columns
last week before the balloting began
that cither Associate Justice Charles
E. Hughes or Col. Theodore Roosevelt
"would in the final show down walk
away with the presidential nomination"
and on the third ballot as far as the
nomination was concerned it was all
over for Mr. Hughes and his friends
aud supporters in the convention but
tho shouting and long before the re
sult of the third and last ballot was
announced the delegates started to
rush or climb into his band wagon
and his nomination was made unani
mous, former vice-president Charles
Warren Fairbanks of Indiana was
selected as the running mate of Mr.
Hughes by the Grand Old Party Na
tional Convention. On the receipt of
the news at his home in Washington,
D. C, that he had been selected as the
standard bearer of his "party for presi
dent, Mr. Hughes promptly relinquished
his duties as Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of tho United States;
there was some doubt in the minds of
many of those who at first failed to
fall in lino for him as to whether or
not ho would consent to accept the
great and the distinguished honor
which had been so suddenly heaped
upon him he soon set tho minds of all
ihoso who entertained such false ideas
and his letter or statement in connec
tion with his acceptance of the nomina
tion is more than clear cut, it is the
product of a polished or highly fin
ished scholar and it is chuck full of tho
spirit of true Americanism, it is re
produced in full as follows:
Hughes' Message of Acceptance.
Washington, D. C. Juno 10.
"Mr. Chairman and Delegates: I
havo not desired the nomination. I
have wished to remain on the bench.
Hut in this critical period of our na
tional history I recognize that it is
your right to summon and that it is
my paramount duty to respond.
"You speak at a timo of -national
exigency transcending merely partisan
considerations. You voice tho demand
for a dominant, thoroughgoing Amer
icanism, with firm protective upbuild
ing policies essential to our peace and
security; and to that call, in this crisis,
I cannot fail to answer with the pledge
of all that is in me to the service of
our country. Therefore, I accept the
nomination.
For Eights of Americans.
"I stand for the firm and unflinch
ing maintenance of all the rights of
I American citizens on land and sea. I
neither impugn motives nor underesti
mate difficulties. But it is most re
grettably true that in our foreign rela
tions we have suffered incalculably
from the weak and vacillating course
which has been taken with regard to
Mexico, a course lamentably wrong
with regard to both our rights and our
duties.
"We interfered without consistency,
and while seeking to dictate when wo
were not concerned, we utterly failed
to appreciate and discharge our plain
duty to our own citizens.
"At the outset of tho administra
tion the high responsibilities of our
diplomatic intercourse with foreign na
tions were subordinated to a concep
tion of partisan requirements and pre
sented to the world a humiliating
spectacle of ineptitude.
United States Has Lost Prestige.
"Belated efforts have not availed to
recover the influence and prestige so
unfortunately sacrificed, and bravo
words have been stripped of their
force by indecision.
"I desire to see our diplomacy re
stored to its best standards, and to
have these advance; to havo no sacri
fices of national interests to partisan
expediency; to have the first ability
of the country always at its command,
here and abroad, in diplomatic Inter
course; to maintain firmly our rights
under international law, insisting stead
fastly upon all our rights as neutrals,
and, fully performing our international
obligations; and by tho clear corect
ness and justice of our position and
our manifest ability and disposition to
sustain them to dignify our place
among the nations. v
Have Only One Country.
"I stand for an Americanism that
knows no ulterior purpose for a patri
otism which is single and complete.
Whether native or 'naturalized, of
whatever race or creed, wo have but
one country, and we do not for an
instant tolerate any division of alle
giance. "I believe in making prompt provi
sion to assure absolutely our national
securityi I believe in preparedness,
not only entirely adequate for our de
fease "with respect to numbers and
equipment, in both army and navy, but'
with all thoroughness to the end that
in each branch of .the service there
may be the utmost efficiency under the
most competent administrative heads.
"We are devoted to the ideals of
honorable peace. We wish to promote
all wise and practical measures for the
just settlement of international dis
putes. No Danger of Militarism.
"In view of our abiding ideals, there
is no danger of militarism in this coun
try. We have no policies of aggres
sion, no lust for territory, no zeal for
strife.
"It is in this spirit that wo demand
adequate provision for national de
fense, and we condemn the inexcusable
neglect that has been shown in this
matter of first national importance.
Wo must have the strength which self
respect demands, the strength of an
efficient nation ready for every emerg
ency. "Our preparation must bo industrial
and economical as well. Our sevofipt
test will come after tho war is over.
We must make a fair and wiser ad
justment of the tariff, in accordance
with sound principles to secure our eco
nomic independence and maintain
American standards of living.
"We must conserve the best inter
ests of labor, realizing that in demo
cracy patriotism and strength must be
rooted in even handed justice.
For Honest Business.
"In preventing, as we must, unjust
discrimination and monopolistic prac
tices, we must still be zealous to assure
tho foundations of honest business.
"Particularly should wo seek the ex
pansion of foreign trade. We must not
throttle enterprise, here or abroad, but
rather promote it and take pride in
honorable achievement.
"Wo must take up the serious prob
lem of transportation, of interstate
and foreign commerce, in a sensible
and candid manner, and provide an
enduring basis for prosperity by the
intelligent use of tho constitutional
powers of congress-, so as adequately to
protect the public on the one hand and
on the other to conserve the essential
instrumentalities of progress.
"I stand for the principles of our
civil service laws. In every depart
ment of government the highest effi
ciency must be insisted upon. All laws
and programs are vain without efficient
and impartial administration.
Indorses G. O. P. Platform.
"I cannot, within the limits of this
statement, speak upon all the subjects
that will require attention. I can only
say that I fully indorse tho platform
you havo adopted.
"I deeply appreciate the responsi
bility you impose. I should havo been
glad to havo that responsibility placed
upon another. But I shall undertake
to meet it, grateful for the confidence
you express.
"I sincerely trust all former differ
ences may bo forgotten and that wo
may have united efforts in a patriotic
realization of our national need and
opportunity.
"I have resigned my judicial office,
and I am ready to devote myself un
reservedly to the campaign.
"Charles E. Hughes."
It must bo said to tho credit of the
Bepublican presidential candidate that
all times he has been one of
tho most popular men with the
newspaper men in this country as
the fearless and courageous Gov
ernor of the State of New York and
as District Attorney of New York City,
he was ever ready to give the news
paper men a lead on a good line story,
HON. CHAELES E.
and at all times he is more than willing
to extend tho glad hand to them and
greet them with hia far famed broad
smile.
Mr. Hughes will not sit down
nor stand around and look wise,
on tho contrary ho will assist
tho leaders and managers of his
party in waging a brilliant cam
paign from now until the close of the
polls on the night of the election, the
first Tuesday in November; his friends
and well wishers book him and Mr.
Fairbanks as real live winners and
they claim that they will receive the
solid Bepublican voto throughout tho
country; that 90 percent of the Pro
gressive voters will swing in lino for
them and they -will also receive the
votes of many progressive Democrats.
Col. Theodore Eoosevelt and his poli
tical star of hopo sank below tho hori
zon when he failed to receive the nomi
nation for president of the United
States at the hands of the delegates
attending tho Bepublican National
Convention and shortly after that he
ran up tho whito flag and refused to
stand for tho nomination which was
presented to him on a silver platter by
tho Bull Moose convention and before
his loyal friends and supporters had
time to count ne, two, three, he
whirled around and ran out from under
tho head leaders of the Progressive

CLIHOlf1ST
FOE PRESIDENT
THE EEV. HON. ARCHIBALD
JAMES CAREY, PH. D. D. D.
Bov. A. J. Carey, Chicago's first citi
zen, made a fine run for tho A. M. E.
bishopric. A candidato for this ex
alted offico seldom make it on the first
race, as all of the winners of this and
other years can testify. Dr. Carey will
hold his allies together and will be "
elected "hands down' 'in 1920. He is
still a young man and can wait another
four years for tho honor that is cer
tain to come to him in its season. CoL
Richard W. Thompson, in the Freeman,
Indianapolis, Ind., Juno 10th, 1916.
Brother Thompson seemingly is not
awaro of tho fact that tho Bov. Hon.
Archibald James Caroy, Ph. D. D. D.
has failed for tho second time in his
effort to be omo one of 'the bishops of
the A. M. E. Church, and as long as
tho rank and filo of tho members of
that groat church have any voice in
it ho never will be olected ono of its
bishops. Col. Thompson also seems to
be utterly ignorant of tho fact that
the would-bo bishop is one of the most
unpopular A. M. E. preachers In this
part of tho country; it may not be true
but on tho face of it it looks as though
Brother Thompson succeeded in pulling
Brother Carey's leg for some easy
money for writing the above mislead
ing article. Editor.
