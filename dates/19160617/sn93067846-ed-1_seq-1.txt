To President Wilson's nomination
there was only one dissenting vote.
Robert Km met Burke of Illinois, who
earns to the convention announcing
that he was opposed to the president.
His vote technically made the presi?
dent's nomination. 1,0tl to 1.
While the convention was assem?
bling It became known the Nebraska
delegation planned to withdraw the
rice presidential candidacy of Qov.
Morehead. The delegation explained
that President Wilson had not naked
for the nomination of Vice President
Hershall when thev brought out their
governor's candidacy, Before the
convention was called to order the
Col Issum was'so full that the fire de?
partment permitted no more to eome
In. William J. Bryan, however, man?
aged to get by and got his usual up?
roarious reception as he took hie seat
Senator Jamee fcad learned of the Ne?
braska n's plight and rescued him.
At ?:!? o'clock Chairman James
rapped the convention to order.
The crowd yielded to the ripping
of the gavel long enough to hear the
? prayer and then renewed Its demand
for a speech from Mr. Bryan.
Senator Thompson then moved a
suspension of the rulee to permit Mr.
Bryan to speak. When the motion was
pot there were some "noes," but the
chairman ruled two-thirds had voted
en the favor.
A committee, headed by Seuator
Kern of Indiana, escorted Mr. Bryan
to the speaker's place, while the floor
and galleries rosred their aproval.
Senator James Introduced Mr.
Bryan as "one of the leading citizens
of the world and America's greatest
Democrat."
Mr. Uryan spoke for 45 minutes
and closed amid loud choers of ap
plaese.
Outside the hall, meanwhile, the
crush had become so great thnt th*?
police fairly battled With besieging
' throngs.
Several arrests were made. Tlckot
'Peculator** were quoting a "last
hance" rate of $1 apiece.
Mr. Uryan opened by expressing his
appreciation of the honor conferred by
the Invitation to speak to the conven?
tion. "Every Democratic convention
Is s love feast to me." he said. "It
gives me sn opportunity to meet and
renew acquaintances with men with
whom I have been associated In poli?
tic* for more than 20 years." He paid
his respects In complimentary mari?
aer to s niimt?er of Democratic offl
* ! tii.I b is of ihe convention.
Reviewing the struggles of the I
Democratic perty, Mr. Bryan said:
"Aticr 19 years of waiting our party
entered the White House and fortu?
nately we won the senate and the
house at the same time. Our party
became responsible for national af?
fairs and now we come after three
years of labor to make our plans for
the future and to submit to the
American people the' claims of our
party to continued confidence.
"Whatever differences of opinion
may exist, or may have existed, as to
particular measures or particular acts,
we are here to begin the fight of 1916,
a united party In eyery State in' the
Union, ready for battle.
"Today thoce who stand for the
Democratic party are able to go be?
fore this nation and not only give a
reason for the faith that Is In them,
but give a defense of the administra?
tion's ^lalms to the confidence of the
people.
"You may take all the administra?
tions from the beglm ug of our his?
tory as a republic to the beginning of
the present one and you will not find
as many laws written upon the
statute hooka of great importance
to the people as you will find written
hi the last three years by Wood row
Wilsen, a Democratic president"
Briefly Mr. Bryan then referred td
the tariff revision, the federal reserve
law and the strengthening of the anti?
trust laws.
"Here were three great measures,
carrying out the promise of a Demo
Uratlc platform and these three great
p^RWvSheWt which the Republican
party dare net attack.
; "Why, my friends. If President Wil?
son yielded to the demand of those
who have clamored for intervention
in Mexico we would no sooner have
crossed the line than the same men
would tell htm that the soldiers must
never come out, for, my friends, an?
nexation is the next step after inter?
vention has been undertaken. And if
we invade Mexico these same men
would say, 'On to Panama.'
"But, my friends, the president not
only hast had to deal with war to the
south of us, but wirb war to the east
of v?.?. My friends, I have differed
from our president on some of the
modes employed in this war, but I
am one of those who desire sincerely
that this nation shall not become a
participant in the dreadful conflict.
"We have a record upon which we
can appeal to the people for their
support, without fear and without
blush. I believe the American peo?
ple grateful for what this adminis?
tration has done, grateful that we
have peace In this country while war
stalks throughout the world, will not
be unmindful of tho fact that 11 was
a Democratic president, supported
by a Democratic senate and house,
who had thus saved the country the
horrors of that war.
"My friends, I believe there is now
before this country an opportunity
such as no other country has ever had
since the beginning of time. I be?
lieve that God, in His providence, has
reserved for the United States the
honor and the task of lifting the mor?
al codo that governs inc uaH up to
the level of nations and making it a
part of the code of all nations.
"I, as a lover of my country, want
my country to win this greatest of all
prizes. As a Democrat I want my
party to have the honor that shall
come with tho accomplishment and
fulfillment of such a task, and I stand
with tho Democrats of the nation to
give to Woodrow Wilson an oppor?
tunity to be that man."
Mr. Bryan was loudly applauded as
he concluded.
When the roll of the States was
called for nominations. Alabama
yielded to New Jersoy and Judge John
W. Wescott nominated President Wil?
son.
As Judge Wescott closed with the
name "Woodrow Wilson." the crowd
broke into a great demonstration.
Moving picture flashlights blazed and
flags wore paraded in front of the
stands. The band played "The Star
Spangled Banner," while a huge ban?
ner bearing the president's likeness
was unfurled from the roof of the
hall.
STATE MILITIA BOARD MEETS
TO APPORTION FUND.
National Guard Kay Mobilixe in Co?
lumbia at Invitation of Chamber of
Comnierco?To Provide Entertain?
ment for Men and Officers.

board met yesterday at the State
house to apportion the State appro?
priation and discus the matter of the
annual encampment of the National
Guard. R. W. Holcombe, secretary
of the Chamber of Commerce, extend?
ed an invitation from Columbia, prom?
ising that every attention Will' be
shown to the officers and men of the
militia.
An effort Is being made to h?ye the
encampment held at some point 1*101
out the State. The war department
has been asked by the adjutant gen?
eral to give a ruling in the matter.
Styx, the State mobilisation ground hi
Lexington county, is also being con?
sidered as a site for the regular en?
campment. It is stated that Columbia
will be the mobilisation point , bl the
event that the troops are ordered to
the Mexican border.
Following the meeting yesterday
the following statement was . fpued
relative to the allotment of the jBtate
funds:

ing in the office of the adjutant gen?
era' at the State house for the', pur?

tice, $100; . two regimental inspectors
of small arms practice, at $100,
!200; expenses of the inspector-in
jstructor, $400.
There was no attempt to control
I th^ crowd. Men and women wearing
various kinds of badges to which they
were not entitled overran the platform
and the press section at will. The
passages to the telegraph room were
so packed that only those who had
I their telegraph instruments on the
platform could send the nesw of the
convention to the outside world.
The crowd and several women
I suffrage workers mounted the plat?
form and hold a suffrage umbrella
over the head of Representative
Heftin of Alabama, one of the most
vigorous "antis" in congress. At 11:30
Chairman/ Jame^ sounded the first
gavel rap and all except a few dele?
gates resumed their seats. The dem?
onstration had lasted 45 minutes. The
roll call of States was resumed and
Arizona yielded to Ohio. Former Gov.
Harmon of Ohio made the first sec?
onding speech In behalf of President
Wilson.
"I came on behalf of the Ohio dele?
gation." he said, "representing tho
unanimous wish of the Ohio Democ?
racy to second the nomination of
Woodrow Wilson for president of the
[United States.
'The real Issue of this campaign is
pjatriotlsm. The party that nominated
Woodrow Wilson must renominate
him as a Democrat hut he will be re
elected as an American."
The second speech in seconding the
president's nomination was made by
Gov. Stuart of Virginia, to whom tho
Arkansas delegation yielded.
Oh the vote Robert Emmet Burke
of Illinois, a delegate who announced
he would not vote for the president,
raised the only voice in opposition.
He was eleeted as an Independent.
Many delegates and spectators
made a rush for the exits when the
vice presidential nomination was
made and in the confusion Senator
James with great difficulty restored
order.
Resolutions were then read and
adopted appointing Chairman James
and Former Gov. Glynn of New York
chairmen of commutes, respectively,
to notify the president and vico pres?
ident of their nomination.
Senators Hughes. Taggart and Var
daman were appointed to confer with
the platform committee, which still
was In session, to learn If it was
ready to report.
GREAT STRIKE THREATENED.
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND
RAILROAD MEN MAY QUIT.
Notice Served on Managers of Roads
by Labor Leaders?Demands Must
be Acceded to Avert Strike.
New York, June 15.?Unless the
railroads agree this afternoon to the
employees demands three hundred
thousand men will walk out. The la?
bor leaders have served this notice on
the managers of the roads.
New York, June 14.?A continuance
of the conference between representa?
tives of 350,000 railroad workers and I
their employes called to avert a pos?
sible general strike involving all the
roads in the United States, hinged to?
night upon the decision of the railroad
managers as to whether they would
offer a apecific compromise to the
demands of their employes. The men
flatly rejected today the railroads' ten?
tative compromise proposal and ad?
journment was \aken until tomorro "
when the managers will report
whether they are prepared to present
a definite proposition.
The managers went into an execu?
tive session that continued until late
tonight. Leaders of the men an?
nounced that no matter what the
offer of the railroads, it will be re
jected\unless all existing double com?
pensation rules are retained. They
are willing to compromise on the
other issues involved?the eight hour
day and time and a half for over?
time.
In their tentative compromise offer
the railroads have indicated their will?
ingness to grant the demands of the
men on condition that the double
compensation rules be abolished. The
men declare that such action: would
not only nullify 25 years of effort, but
also Impair their earning power.
Late tonight the railroad managers
authorised the statement that it was
highly probable no counterpropositlori
would be made to the workers. Mem?
bers of the brotherhood also an
1 haunted that they expected the ratl
, roajja. w'ou|d not meet their demand
' lyOre ready to leave for their homel?
and send out a call to vote on a gen?
eral strike.
The break came near the close of
today's session when the railroad
managers finished answering most of
the 105 questions propounded by the
men regarding the operation of their
tentative compromise offer. A. B.
Garretsotr, president of the Order of
Railroad Conductors, speaking for the
brotherhoods, informed Ellsha Lee,
chairman of the managers' committee,
that the proposition was not accept?
able to the men.
"Then," asked Chairman Lee, "I
understand your position to be that
even If we told you we would accop'
your proposition, modified by ours,
you could not accept It?"
"We would not accept It," was Mr.
Garretson's reply. "But," he added
"I want it distinctly understood we
could."
"Now, I will say this," Chairman
Lee declared. "This thing Is to our
mind as well as yours, quite a serious
proposition. It involves substantially
all the railroads In the country, and.
It seems to me, we can not break until
we are definitely prepared to say to
each other?we are done! Tomorrow
morning, I think, we will definitely
tell you how we stand on the whole
business."
Mr. Garretson said if the offer of
the railroads was fair, a settlement
might be reached.
"We have an Immense settling
power on our side," he declared, "al?
though the power of initiative lies
altogether with our rank and file. We
can settle at any stage of the game,
but a settlement would be absolutely
valueless that was counter to the rank
and file. This is a preliminary crisis,
not the final one."
Senator Lewi:; of Illinois then was
called to the platform to fill In the
wait With a speech.
Senator Lewis, however, cut it short
and merely thanked the crowd for its
applause. The crowd wanted some?
body to talk and there were cries for
"Tom Hetlin" and Irvin Cobb." Hef
lin took the platform.
While he was talking the conferees
returned from the platform commit?
tee and reported that the platform
would not be ready for the conven?
tion for two or three hours more.
Senator Hughes recommended an ad?
journment.
When Mr. Hetlin finished Senator
Hsighcs reported that the platform
committee was not ready to report.
The subcommittee was agreed, he
said, but the entire committee was
not assembled. Motions to recede
were Called out from the floor. It
finally was agreed to meet again at
*1 a. m.
SECOND MEETING H BETHEL
PEOPLE BECOMING MTCII IN?
TERESTED IN SANITARY
PRECAUTIONS.
Dr. Ilowell Illustrates Talk on Rav?
ages of Hook Worm with Stcrcopti*
cO ii Slide?Rev. Haynsworth and
Farmers of Community Indorse
Work and Promise Their Aid.
The second public health meeting of
Eethcl school district, Sumter coun?
ty, under the unit health survey put
on by Dr. J. T. Howell, director of ru?
ral sanitation of the State Board of
Health, was held at Bethel school last
Monday evening.
Dr. Howell was assisted by Dr.
Brouhn of the State health hoard,
and Secretary Reardon, of the Sum?
ter Chamber of Commerce.
Rev. William Haynsworth, pastor
of Bethel Baptist church presided,
and after opening the meeting with/
prayer, he delivered a short talk ei
phaslzing the importance of tl
work being done by Dr. Howell a' ;
his assistants. * g
Rev. Haynsworth took occasior ?q
stress the importance of comm? ^
Interest and organization, and ^
that the State hoard of health
fering a very valuable and exce .1
opportunity to the people of ht^. c
tion, one that they would perhaps
never again be able to secure, and he
trusted that the people will take ad?
vantage of the scientific educational
features thereof. f
Dr. Howell delivered an unusually
interesting, instructive, and compre?
hensive illustrated lecture regarding
Uie hook worm disease so prevalent in
the Southern rural districts. He il?
lustrated his remarks with numbers
of greatly enlarged microscopic pic?
tures of the hook worm In every
phase of its life history, and showing
the effects also by photographs of the
manner in which this parasite enters
(the system and finally works its way
to the abdominal lining, and sucks
the life blood of its victim.
His pictures and lecture were startl
lngly convincing in, the extreme, b\
living victims of the hook worm, by
pictures of the insects in their va?
rious stages of growth, and in many
other ways he awakened the interest
of his hearers.
He showed wherein the hook worm
has its greatest opportunity of doing
its deadly work in the rural sections,
and pointed out the tremendous eco?
nomic loss by depreciation of physical
and mental efficiency from the hook
worm ravages.
Dr. Howell is one of the plainest,
yet convincing and fluent talkers
imaginable. He eliminates entirely
every complicated, mystifying, tech?
nical phrase of therapeutical form so
common to many physicians, and his
audiences are able to follow intelli?
gently every line of thought Intro?
duced by the speaker.
Rev. Haynsworth called upon Sec?
retary Reardon for a' short talk on
how to best organize a community for
efficient cooperation and direct bene?
ficial results.
Mr. Reardon told how since the first
meeting at Bethel, a week prior to last
Monday night, the city "council and
board of health of Sumter had put
into effect In Sumter sanitary laws em?
bracing every feature of Dr. Howell's
recommendations for Bethel school
district, and of practically the same
nature so far as fly proof sanitary
closets are concerned, and how the
Chamber of Commerce, Civic League,
city council, and board of health, rep?
resenting nearly twelve thousand
citizens of Sumter work harmoniously
and splendidly together for the uplift
of Sumter's citizenship.
He said that.the Sumter Chamber
of Commerce is intensely interested in
the unit health survey in the rural dis?
tricts, and that he is following Dr.
Howell with every available source
of cooperation as the representative c f
the business interests of Su nter.
Dr. Howell is able to report that a
number of the land owners of Bethel
school district have agreed to begin
building tly proof sanitary closets,
not only for their families, but for
their negro tenants, and to fight the
Hies, mosquitoes, and hook worm.
Mr. J. M. Kolb, one of the most pro?
gressive and public spirited farmers of
i
Bethel district endorsed Dr. Howell's
work and promised to do just what
the expert sanitarian suggested, and
also to give his intleunee among his
friends and neighbors, who were not
at the meeting to attain the tame ends
as suggested by Dr. Howell.
? Mr. Kolb explained that owing to
this being the busiest season among
the farmers, it appeared, from the
comparatively small attendance of the
second meeting that the farmers of
Bethel are not interested. But he
felt, as a matter of fact that they
SITUATION GROWS UNSER.
DEFINITE ACTION TOWARDS
MEXICO WILL BE DELAYED,
HOWEVER,
Probable That no Steps Will be Tak?
en Until After Democratic Conven?
tion Closes, Unless Measures are
Necessary ? Anti-American Feeling
Growing in Northern Mexico.
Washington, June 13.?Unless the
increasing seriousness of conditions in
Mexico forces action, the reply to
Gen. Carranza's demand for with?
drawal of American troops probably
will be delayed until after the St.
Louis convention because the admin?
istration desires to avoid any drastic
a time when it might appear
?rompted by political influ
etary Lansing and his advisers
^ /aid to have given careful consld
ion to the possibility that the ad
iistration might be charged with
0 tying politics in dealing with the
:oblem. The rapid spread of anti
?.merican propaganda In northern
Mexico, however, coupled with in?
creasingly grave economic conditions
1 may take the situation out of their
hands.
No official would venture a predic?
tion tonight as to what might be ex?
pected in the immediate future. In
common with some consuls in Mexico
they believe almost any eventuality is
possible with agitators working on the ,
feelings of a people already dis?
tressed by fie fruits of prolonged dis?
order. It was stated positively ,that
the Washington government was con?
sidering no aggressive action to be
taken of its own motion, but stood
ready to act should assaults on Amer?
icans or an attack on Gen. Pershing's
forces force the issue* *11f^8
The state department today received
confirmation of the identlficau ?a Of
one of the Mexicans kille 1 in the
Coleman ranch raid as Lieut. 0.
Villareal of the Carranxa army. It
is understood the development imme?
diately was called to Qan?jg?fflB|?fl?|
gltts9SStiRSBF*B4L*fBfa
notto "give It Special
ing an explanation from the ?S fkc'to
government.
The loose control of the Carranrtt
commanders over their men is one of
the complicating factors with which
the administration has been con?
fronted all along.
A sharp rejoinder Ms being prepared
to the Carranza note. It will repeat
the determination of President Wil?
son to keep American troops in Mei
ico until the Carranza forces haVe
shown their ability and intention to
properly police the border States. It
is also to rebuke the de facto govern?
ment for the suggestions and state?
ments in its note questioning the good
faith of the Washington administra?
tion. Some officials regard parts of
the Carranza note as insulting to a de?
gree not to be tolerated.
WISACKY CROPS GOOD.
People Much Interested in Games of
Pee Dee League?Pieinc on Lynches
River.
Wisacky, June 13.?We have had
fine rains lately and while the cotton
is small for the time of year, it is in
good condition and growing rapidly.
The corn crop is very good. Gardens,
while poor, have Improved very much
since the rains began.
On last Saturday a few families took
with them well filled baskets and
spread the dinner on the banks of
Lynches' Hiver.
The day was certainly very much en?
joyed, bathing being the principal
sport.
Quite a large crowd attended the
ball game Monday, between Blshop
ville and Bennettsvllle. It was a
hard fought game to the finish. Neith?
er side scoring until the fourth inning,
when Blshopvllle made one score.
The feature of the game was the
splendid work of the men in the field.
The score stood at the close, nine In?
nings, Blshopvllle 1, Bennettsvillc, 0.
They will play two more games In
Hishopvllle, Tuesday and Wednesday.
They are expecting quite a large crowd
at both the games.
were, and are becoming more and
more interested, and that the next
health meeting, two weeks from that
evening will be attended by a large
number of Bethelites.
Dr. Howcll addressed a largo crowd
of colored people at one of the ne?
gro churches last Tuesday evening,
Riving an illustrated lecture also.
The unit health survey embraces
within its scope of work the education
of the colored population also, and
the securing of their Interest and co?
operation.
