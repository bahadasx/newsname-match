Red Trail Officials Give Interest­
ing Talk at Commercial
Club.
BISMARCK DELEGATION
MEETS THE TOURISTS
•Good Roads Generally Met With,
and Tour Is on Schedule
Time.
(An enthusiastic audience at the
Commercial ciub last night heard the
Red Trail officials on tour from Chi
cago to Tacoma explain the advantag­
es of this great national highway.
Slides were shown of many views of
universal interest, including several
of Bismarck and Burleigh county.
L. H. Brown, a well known Spokane
attorney and secretary of the Wash­
ington State Good Roads association,
was the official pilot on the pictorial
lour and he gave an entertaining,
running descriptive talk as scene af­
ter scene, each surpassing the last in
point of beauty, was flashed upon the
screen.
Yellowstone, Ranier and Glacier
parks were visited a jaunt was taut­
en through the Had Lands a peelc
Was taken into the vitals of a great
glacier a pleasant moment was spent
at. the .Minneapolis Country club, and
mile
after
mile of wonderfully good
road was hastily traversed.
Explains Washington's Plan.
Mr. Brown explained what Wash­
ington is doing in the interests or
good roads. No highway accepted by
that state .giay...contain a, grade of
more than 5 per cent. This is true of
the roads crossing the mountains,
where oft tinges great difficulties must
be surmounted and heavy expense in­
curred in order to maintain the stand­
ard grade. He showed how beautiful,
permanent concrete bridges and cul
yerts are replacing makeshift affairs
how the road is protected where pro­
tection is necessary how everything
is made as easy ami as attractive as
possible for the tourist.
Mr. Brown described the automo­
bile car as the "vacation vehicle."
lie told how the automobile has come
into its own in Yellowstone and other
great national parks, where it is now
admitted on the same terms as horse
drawn vehicles. He explained how
the improvement of highways short­
ens distances and makes the route
more attractive, and he declared that
North Dakota, as a half-way station
.on the greatest of all transcontinent­
al trails, enjoys a marked advantage
in its ability to attract tourists from
the west, as well as those from the
east.
'North Dakota, he asserted, has an al­
most ideal road-making soil. It should
have the best roads on the trail at
the least cost. To date its roads are
not good. North Dakota, he felt, is
not J'et fully alive to the importance
of the Red Trail. He advocated a
gravel dressing for the Trail through­
out the state, in order that it might
be a good bad-weather road, as well
as a fair-weather road.
The speaker was introduced by
President C. k. Young of the Com­
mercial club, who explained the at­
tendance had suffered from the exo­
dus of the "Best People on Earth:'
to Dickinson. He commended the of­
ficial touring party upon its enterprise
and assured t,he visitors that Bis­
marck appreciated their coming.
The journey westward will be r5»
sumed this morning, and this evening
the tourists will meet the good roads
boosters at 'Dickinson.
Governor L. B. Hanna received the
members of the National Parks high­
way touring party at the state capi
tol yesterday afternoon and gave a
hearty endorsement to the .plan of a
transcontinental highway from Chi­
cago by way of the Twin Cities, Bis­
marck and Spokane to Seattle and Ta
eoma.
"i wish it understood that I heartily
approve of this step to open a high­
way to the tourist' from Chicago to
Puget Sound, connecting the three na­
tional parks,'', said the governor, "and
you can rest' assured that the state
of North Dakota, will do its part to
aid the movement. The subject of
good roads is one in which I am deep­
ly interested and the entire country
is rapidly awakening to the social
and economic advantages of improv­
ed highways."
J. W. Bliss, state highway commis­
sioner, joined the governor in welcom­
ing the party, arid with the governor,
and tourist visitors, posed for a pic­
ture in front of the two big Mitchell
Sixes which are conveying the trail
Jblaaers across the continent.

LARGE PROPERTY
INTERESTS EFFECTED
Fargo, N. D„ June 1G.—By unani­
mous vote of the 1,028 accredited dele­
gates making up this year's confer­
ence, the United Lutheran Church of
America today instructed its officials
to take the legal steps necessary to
bring about, a union of the United
Lutheran churches with the Norwe­
gian Synod Lutheran church.
Furthermore, the united conference
adopted such instructions to its offi­
cials that ,in the event that the Ilaug
es Lutheran conference, now in ses­
sion at Red Wing, Minn-, votes favor­
ably on the question of uniting with
the United and Norwegian churches,
they shall also be included. The Nor­
wegian Lutheran Church of America
is the name of the new church that
will grow out of today's action. The
United Lutheran Church of America
had at the last census, 285,05: mem­
bers in the United States and Canada,
with 1,630 clergymen. The Norwegian
Synod, with which it joins, has 152,160
members and 1,025 clergy: if the
Hauges church joins, 60,000' more
members, and
400
more clergy, will be
affiliated in the new Lutheran church.
Property aggregating $5,000,000 is di­
rectly affected by the combination.
More than 2,'500 ministers and lay­
men are in Fargo. It is one of the
largest gatherings Fargo has ever en­
tertained and by Sunday it is expected
that all records for crowds in the
city will have been broken.
The twenty-sixth annual convention
of this denomination was declared
open by the Right Reverend T. H.
Dahl, D. D., president of the church,
immediately following the opening
services in the auditorium.

Dr. J. N. Kildahl of St. Anthony

SUFFRAGE FIGHT
Leaders of Woman'9 Party De­
nounce Suffrage Planks in
Dem Platform
ACCUSE WILSON OF
"PLAYING POLITICS"
Wire President, Asking Him to
State His Position in the
Matter
St. Louis, .June lfi.—Leaders of the
Woman's party and the National
American Woman's Suffrage associa­
tion tonight united in denouncing the
inadequate suffrage plank of the Dem­
ocratic platform and declared they
would resume their fight in congress
for national recognition. After ad­
journment of the convention, Mrs.
Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the
National American-Woman's Suffrage
associatoin, called' a special meeting
of the National board and later issued
the l'oilbWlrig officTarStatement:""
"No suffragist who was present at
the convention today could misinter­
pret either tha ,*lpeechew or the-action
taken by the- Democratic party in
adopting the alleged woman's suffrage
platform in its national platform.
"The Democrats admitted freely in
their speeches that 'political exigency'
demanded 'some kind of a suffrage
plank,' and they sought to hoodwink
the women by a jumble of words that
were designed to meet the situation,
but in 110 sense succeeded.
"The so-called suffrage plank, which
they adopted after hursts of eloquence
that were far more frank than intelli­
gent, cannot be expected to win the
presidential campaign for them. Hut
it may well be expected to win the
antagonism of millions of men and
women voters in all parts of the coun­
try.
"If I be plank adopted today is the
president's choice, the world may just­
ly accuse him of descending to the
tricks of the cheapest politician in or­
der to bid for votes by flaunting a
plank that may be interpreted in as
many ways as there are people."
Send Message to Wilson.
Mrs. Catt also sent the following
telegram to President Wilson:
"In as much as Governor K'erguson
of Texas and Senator Walsh of Mon­
tana made diametrically opposite
statements in the Democratic conven
toin today, in regard to your attitude
toward the suffrage plank adopted by
the convention, we apply to you di­
rectly to state your position on this
plank and give your precise interpre­
tation of its meaning.
(Signed) "Carrie Chapman Catt."
St. Louis, Mo., June 16.—The demo
cratical convention finished its worl
today by adopting the party platform
exactly as approved by President Wil­
son and submitted by the resolutions
committee, including the planks on
Americanism and favoring woman suf­
frage, but not until the harmony *f
its three-day session Jias been rip­
pled with a row over the suffrage
plank.
No voice was raised against the vig­
orous declarations of the American­
ism plank. At one time it looked as
if the suffrage plank had been lost,
but after Senator Walsh of Montana

watching the fire for a long time -De
fore any alarm was sent in, the im­
pression being that some one was

AN IMMEDIATE GLA8K
General Pershing's Forces Aril
Distributed at Strategic .,
Points-
Chihuahua City, June 16.—General'
Jacinto Travino, commanding the Car*
ranzista army of the north, today ad«
ivsed Gen. J. J. Pershing, American
expeditionary commander, that any
movement of American troops from
their present lines to the bputh, east
or west, woula be considered a hos­
tile act and a signal to commence war­
fare. Gen. Trevino acted on specifio
instructions from Genj Carransa.
Washington, June 16.—'There wer»
410
indications .here tonight that- th«
administration's determination to con­
tinue the campaUhr agftinst bandit*
would ia any way be altered by Gen.
Trevino's reported threat to begin
hostilities if the American troops
move from "their present position in
any direction, except toward the bor­
der.
Gen. Pershing's orders authorised
him to move in any direction he find*
necessary.
No Fear of Impending Clash.
There is no fear of an impending
clash, however, for officials ibelieva
Gen. Pershing would avoid taking any
step that, might lead to serious con­
sequences, until he had communicated
with Washington. Late tonight th»
war department had no word from
him or any other source to confirm the
report of Gen. Trevino's action. Re­
cent troop movements in Chihuahua
have lead officials here to fear that
the de facto commanders were pre­
paring' for some hostile move.
The Mexican forces now are distrifc
iited in detachments of considerable
strength on two lines, conversing
from points near the border east and
west of Gen. Pershing's line and meet­
ing at a point south of his field base
at Namiquipa. The effect has been to
enclose the American troops in a gi­
gantic "V."
This disposition of Carranza troops:
has been one of the basis of suspicion
as to his position. While the Mexi­
cans are so posted, the officials de*
dare they cannot be in good faithi
conducting any campaign against
bandits, but they can keep close
watch on the movements of Ge. Per*
shing's men. The breaking np of the
forces into small parties to scour tbe
country for outlaws is one of the eon*
ditions which would be demanded bf
the United States before the Ainerh
can expedition would be recalled.
No Fear for Safety.
Army officers have no fear for th4
safety of Gen. Pershing's forces, no
mater what developes. The strategia
points at the base camp and along the
lines of communications are protected
by entrenchments.
The report of Gen. Trevino'»
tions gave rise to a new speculation
as to the course to be taten by Presb
dent Wilson, to make certain tbe safe*
ty of the entire torder. The eptir#
National Guard, in effect, has been an*
der waiting orders for several weeks*
and some officials thought It possible
a big force of guardsmen wonld be
promptly ordered to the border, it
later dispatches confirm the Chfhuan
