DELAY REPLY TO CARRANZA
Precautions Being Taken Against
Outbreak of Anti-Americanism
When Note Finally Is
Delivered.
Gen. Funston advised the War
Department today that he was informed
by Gen. Bell.at El Paso
that Gen. Pershing had been
warned by Gen. Trevino, Carranza
commander at Chihuahua, that
any movement of the American
expedition to the south, west or
east would be a signal for an attack
by the Mexican forces.
Xo word has come so far from
Gen. Pershing himself, but even
before the arrival of Gen. Funston's
message department officials
were inclined to credit newspaper
dispatches telling of the
Trevino warning Preparations
have been made for any eventual-,
ity, and Gen. Pershing is ready to
deal with any force that may~be
sent against him. It is probable,
however, that he will hold to his
present lines, and make no move
n nr^rtnitafp hnctilitipc
May Beinforce Pershing.
Persistent reports are circulating of
the purpose vof the administration to
strengthen its armed forces in Mexican
territory at once, to restore order and
good government. Immediate reinforcements,
it is said, are to be sent
to Gen. Pershing's army of about 13,000
men in the state of Chihuahua to assist
them in case a serious clash should occur
with Gen. Trevino's Mexican troops,
numbering about 50,000, mobilized in
the same vicinity.
For the better movement of troops
across the Rio Grande all the available
engineer troops have been
s^nt to that region, and all the pontoons
and bridge equipment at the engineer
depot at Washington barracks
will be shipped there today or tomorrow
for building military bridges without
unnecessary delay, in case of a
crisis.
Maj. Gray Becrosses Border.
Gen Funston reported also that Maj.
Gmv of the 14th Cavalry, commandin
: the two troops attacke<l by Mexican*
at San Ignacio, Tex., recently, has
returned from an effort to pick up the
trail of the bandits. The cavalry rode
some distance down the American side
of the river, crossed to the Mexican
side on reports that a bandit mobilization
was in progress, turned north
again on the Mexican side for several
miles and recrossed Into American territory
without having encountered any
outlaws or finding a trail.
two acaitionai prisoners were captured
on the American side, and the
body of another dead Mexican found in
the brush near the scene of the attack.
MaJ. Gray reported he had received
am an ranees of co-operation from Carran
sa military commanders across the
llna The Mexican officers said they
bad captured twenty men believed to
bare been engaged in the attack on the
American camp.
The American commander said he believed
the band had been broken up
and that no further activities were to
bo expected from that particular force.
Note to Carxlmza Delayed.
Although the United States* reply tc
Oon. Carranza's last note is virtually
completed, its dispatch le being delayed
while administration officials seek
detailed information on these developments:

a few days.
The Washington government will reaffirm
Its purpose not to intervene further
in Mexican affairs unless forced

"No Change in Program.
There are no Indications here that the
administration's determination to continue
the campaign In Mexico will be
altered by Cen. Trevlno's reported
threat to attack American troops If
they move from their present positions
Chihuahua except toward the border.
... -if. ... IIVi' ITwiM
Gen. Pershing's orders authorize him
to move in any direction he finds necessary
to his purpose. In the absence
of Secretary Baker, who is in St. Louis,
no official would predict whether these
orders would be changed, but the general
impression prevailed that they will
not be.
There is no fear of an immediate clash,
however, for officials believe Gen. Pershing
would avoid taking any step that
might lead to serious consequences until
he had communicated with Washington.
Administration officials still feel great
anxiety as to what the result may be
when the American note is delivered.
For this reason they are taking proper
precautionary measures, including preparations
for sending refugee ships to both
Mexican coasts and for mobilization of a
part or all of the National Guard. Orders
sent to the inspectors general of the various
militia districts some time ago instructed
them to see that all was in
readiness for the prompt mustering in of
the state soldiers, should the need arise.
Vn neu- inufrnptinno Vtov? hp^n apnt
Study Militia Situation.
Practically all available regulars of
the United States Army, including many
coast artillerymen, already are on the
border or in Mexico, and the National
Guards of Texas, Arizona and New
Mexico are in service for patrol duty.
The guardsmen of other states were
notified some weeks ago to be prepared
to respond if it should become
necessary to call them out.
It was learned today that considerable
correspondence has been exchanged
between the department and
the governors and adjutants general
of various states relative to the new
status given the guardsmen under the
Hay-Chamberlain anrty reorganization
bill, which becomes effective July 1.
These messages are presumed to have
caused recurrent reports that the entire
force of the National Guard was being
prepared for active service.
War Department officials, after a
study of the enlistment requirements of
he various states have determined that
Only the militiamen of one state, Kansas.
can continue under the Hay-Chamberlain
bill without the necessity of reenlistment.
^ual Allegiance Bequired. i
The ?new law requires a dual allegiance
for guardsmen who are to participate
in the militia pay and other federalization
features of the plan. With
the exception of the Kansas regiments
the entire guard must be re-enlisted
under this plan, and this situation has
been called to the attention of each
state afTected in order that there might
be nc delay in putting the reorganization
bill into effect.
Mexican embassy officials said they
had not been informed of any message
sent by Trevino, and that examination
of what purported to be the text of the
warning published in some of the morning
papers was sufficient proof that it
either was a badly garbled translation (
or a fabrication. They were not disposed
to doubt, however, that some kind of a 1
warning naa Deen sent.

Troops Are to Continue
to Cross Mexican Border
Whenever Necessity Arises
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., June 17.?Gen.
Funston and his staff gave careful at- 1
tention today to the activities of out- J
law bands along the Mexican border, i
but far greater interest was displayed
in the attitude being assumed by the
troops of the de facto government.
Gen. Parker, at Brownsville, Tex., ]
made a brief report of the latest manifestation
of outlawry near San Benito,
and Gen. Mann reported the continuation
of the search for bandits that raided
the cavalry camp at San Ignacio, but
it was evident at department headquarters
that greater importance was attached
to the actions of Carranza's
troops tham to those of the bandit
leaders.
Gen. Ricaqt's warning that the cross^
ing of the international boundary by
any American troops for any cause
would be regarded ajuan overt act, and
would be the cause for an attack by the
tie facto government troops, did not

bandits, it was declared, will continue, j 1
and whenever a "hot trail" is found i
leading into Mexico the Americans will 1
not hesitate to follow it. The officers
in charge of troops on the border have
authority to cross into Mexico without
waiting for instructions. j
Has 50,000 Men Beady.
Gen. Funston's afmy of almost 50,000
has been so disposed along the Mexican
border that swift punitive action
could be taken if invited by any overt i
act of Carranza's army. Gen. Jacinto '
Trevino's threat to attack Gen. Pershing
if the American troops move east
or west or south was regarded by army
officers here as little less than a decla- <
ration of hostilities by the Mexicans.
No fear is felt, however, that Gen.
Pershing will not/be able to take care *
of himself. c
Precautions taken by Gen. Bell at El ?
Paso last night in holding all the American
troops ready for action were sim- 1
ilar to those taken at every bonier
point opposite which there was any con- j
siderable number of Carranza troops.
I The greatest activity was displayed)'
at Juarez, because of the marked *
activity of the military authorities, the j ^
arming of a portion of the civilian
population and because of the recent
reinforcement of the Mexican garrison.
The garrison at Eagle Pass was
strengthened by the arrival of the 13th
Infantry. Three companies of the
coast artillery, now on their way
south, will go directly to Laredo. If
the request of Gen. Funston for more
militia?his request never has been
withdrawn?Is granted, the state
troops will be divided along the border
stations, whore their work will be to
garrison bandit-menaced towns, and
the more important border stations.

rangers, under command of Capt. J. J.
Sanders, and several armed citizens
were hurried to Islitas, twenty-flve
miles up the Rio Grande from Laredo
on a report that Mexican bandits were
seen approaching the settlement.
Rangers in that vicinity advised the
few Americana to congregate at the
J. B. Morrow ranch houso, from which
an appeal for aid was telephoned.
Gen. Mann, commanding the Laredo
district of the border patrol, had heard
nothing regarding the raid and was inclined
to believe that if a raid had
been contemplated it had not been carried
out.
Philip C. Hanna, United States consul
general at Monterey and one of the
two remaining American consuls in
Mexico, accompanied by half a dozen
other Americana, arrived here today.
He was reticent as to the object of his
visit.
Asked regarding conditions in Mexico
and the probable length of his stay,
Consul Hanna replied:
"Everything is quiet down the line.
I may remain two or three days."
It has been known- for some time
that Consul Hanna was instructed by
the 8tate Department that he could
leave his post at any time at his own
discretion.

MAY OPEN HIS CAMPAIGN
WITH A JULY 4 SPEECH
Declines to Discnss Political Hatters
in Advance of His Formal
notification.
Charles E. Hughes feels that his trip
to New York this week accomplished
much that was important and valuable
toward his campaign for the presidency.
"While campaign plans were
discussed in a general way nothing
definite has been done concerning his
speaking dates or other details of his
campaign, he said today.
The nominee is to leave Washington
again tomorrow night, and does not
expect to return, unless some unforeseen
contingency calls him back, and
then it will only be for a hurried visit,
he told newspaper men today. For
that reason most of his time today was
devoted to personal matters and so arranging
his affairs that he can getaway
by midnight tomorrow.
He declined today to discuss George
W. Perkins* statement relative to a
move for party f>eace and the restoration
of co-operation between the regular
republicans and the progressives.
He said that at this time he will have
nothing to say regarding any campaign
policies or intentions. He will
wait until notified of his nomination.
Invitations Pouring In.
Mr. Hughes is receiving many invitations
from large cities and organizations
to deliver speeches. A number
of these solicit his presence July 4.
Though it is very probable that the
candidate will deliver his first campaign
speech on that date, no invitation
will be accepted, even tentatively,
for several days yet.
Among the visitors at the Hughes
residence today to pay respects will be
Representative Martin B. Madden of
Chicago, officially bearing the invitation
from the city of Chicago to the repubican
nominee to speak there July 4. As
Chicago is a strategic center, many republican
leaders and advisers expect
that Mr. Hughes may make his opening
address of the campaign there. It is
anderstood that Mr. Hughes will take
he invitation under advisement when it
s presented to him this afternoon.
Callers on His List.
A number of other party leaders and !
personal friends called upon Mr.
Hughes today to pay their respects
and to say "good-bye" when they
heard he does not expect to return to
Washington this summer. Among those
who have appointments for this afternoon
are Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood,
Representative William D. Stephens
of California, a progressive republican;
Senator John D. Works of California,
Representative Richard W. Austin of
Tennessee, former Senator Marion Butler
of North Carolina and more than
a score of other personal friends.
The selection of a national chairman
a.nd campaign manager is engrossing
is much of the candidate's attention as
he can give this subject at this time.
Indications are that the attitude of the
progressives will have considerable
hearing on his selection. The progressives
have brought forward a candidate
In the person of William Loeb, jr., who
was secretary to former President
Roosevelt.
Mr. Hughes' closest advisers are almost
unanimously of the opinion that
he will virtually manage his own campaign
and will keep in constant and
close touch with all important details.
George R. Sheldon, treasurer of the
republican national committee for three
terms, is expected to succeed himself.
The personnel* of the executive committee
also is receiving a great deal
>f Mr. Hughes' attention.
Summer Home Not Picked.
The first matter with direct bearing
>n campaign plans to be decided, how
iver, win De wnerc ne win maKe nis
summer home. This has not yet been
letermined. Mr. Hughes, it is known,
ias found a place to his liking "in the
Tills," but this is too far from New
Fork, and the nominee is determined to
ceep close to the center of campaign
ictivities. He now is trying to find
some place in the hills that will' be
ivithin easy railroad access of New
Fork city. This probably will be de:ermined
before he leaves Washington
:omorrow night.
Mr. Hughes expressed himself as be- ;

liis strenuous New York trip. He was

SEEK RETIREMENT LAW
FROM DEMOCRATS NOW
Civil Service Employes Working to
Have Congress Enact Legislation
This Session.
Representatives of organizations of
civil service employes are marshaling
their forces to have Congress pass retirement
legislation at this session.
With a plank in the democratic platform
in favor of retirement, civil service
representatives today said they
would immediately apply the test to
see whether the plank meant anything.
Various organizations worked hard
to obtain the plank in the St. Louis
platform, the National Association of
Letter Carriers being represented by
William J. Gainor, its president, who
made a plea before the committee; the
National Association of Post Office
Clerks, represented by Thomas F. Flaherty,
its president; the United States
Civil Service Retirement Association,
represented by Dr. Llewelyn Jordan,
its secretary, and the National Association
of Civil Service Employes, represented
by L. E. Swartz, W. H. Tate
and William E. Kelly.
Southerners Seem Willing.
"The principal &nd most obstinate objection
to retirement legislation has
heretofore come from the southern
| wing of the democratic party," said
Mr. Flaherty, who returned from St.
Louis today, "and yet at St. Louis
these men seemed willing to accede to
our requests-that the party pledge its
support to the enactment of legislation
Ill pi UlCUl lilO DCITIVO ou)/vi atiuuavvm
With this opposition removed, and
using the platform declaration as a
basis, we propose to begin immediately
to fight to get something tangible
from the present Congress.
"The democratic party is now ii) control
of both branches of Congress and
can, without delay and without serious
opposition, give the needed relief to the
aged workers. The party can show to
the country that its interest in the
preservation of the civil service is real,
and that the St. Louis declaration is
not merely a platform platitude. We
intend to resume the fight next week
with renewed vigor and hope for results."
Mr. Flaherty said the failure to obtain
a retirement plank at Chicago was
a bitter disappointment.

CAR SERVICE MONDAY
Regulations Drafted by Utilities
Commission to Be Laid Before
the Public.
"A scat for every passenger during:
the non-fush hours, and for every
standing passenger during the rush
hours seven square feet of space,"
which is considered a standard for
street railway service in the District,
is to be placed before the public at a
hearing Monday at 10 o'clock in the
boardroom of the District building
by the public utilities commission.
The engineering branch of the commission
made a two-month investigation.
following which it proposed the
standard. That the railway companies
at present are practically complying
with the proposed standard, was noted
in the investigation, it is stated.
There are several exceptions, however.
according to the engineer department
of the commission.
They are the bureau or engraving
and printing and 11th street lines of
the Washington Railway and Electric
Company, and the 14th street line of
the Capital Traction Company. It is
stated that service on several of the
other lines must be improved during
the non-rush hours.
Observations Provided For.
In checking the service it is proposed
that railway companies shall submit
to the commission not less than once
a month observations made during
three consecutive midweek days.
Officials of the railway companies |
have assured the commission co-operation
in meeting the proposed stand-1
ard. The rush hours are set forth from I
6:30 to 9:15 a.m. and from 3:45 to 6:30
o'clock p.m.
BETTER BLOCKADE PLAN
FRAMED BY ENTENTE
LONDON, June 17.?As a result of the
discussion of the blockade at the recent
allied conference in Paris, con- .
elusions were reached which will re- ,
move many misconceptions on the part!
of neutrals, according to Lord Robert
Cecil, minister of war trade, who at- j
tended the conference as a British rep- j
resentative. What these conclusions!
were. Lord Robert would not state, but
he asserted that the blockade would
work better as a result of the conference.
Asked If there would be a tightening
of the blockade, Lord Robert paused
for a long time before answering, then
he replied with a laugh: "There will
be no slackening." Further than that
he would not commit himself.
Lord Robert reiterated that the allies
did not wish to interfere with neutral
trade except such as was to the benefit
of hostile countries.

LONDON, June 17.?There
* are no signs of a halt in the pow>r
erful Russian offensive in Vol^
hynia, Galicia and Bukowina. The
latest Austrian official statement
tells of a Russian check here and
sr there, notably the defeat of a cave
airy force south of the Dniester
in Galicia. The Russians, however,
are remaining on the aggresy
sive, attacking all along the Vole.
hynian front and pressing hard
- gainst the Austrian lines farther
f- south.
lt Gen. von Linsingen's troops
? have engaged the Russians ip batk
tie in the Stokhod and Styr sec
tors, says the official statement issued
by German army headquarters.
The statement adds that
parts of the army of Gen. Count
von Bothmer are engaged in battle
with the Russians to the north
of Przewloka.
I The capture of approximately
170,000 men by the Russians since
the inception of the offensive is
claimed by Petrograd, which declares
that steady advances are
being scored against the Austrian
armies.
Austrian Center Weakens.
Th? chi#?f train of rround announced
II by the Russians during the past
y twenty-four hours was on the Austrian
j center, which up to now held comparatively
firm. The Russians claim to bo
breaking this resistance. The main
contest has been on the front Just north
n of Buczacz, on the Stripa river. Hers
? the Russians are declared to have overthrown
the Austrian army and taken
6,000 prisoners.
A semi-official commentary published
n in Petrograd yesterday says:
d "The absence from the offlcal com>r
munications of the names of places oc>
cupied or the direction taken by Gen.
'8 BrussilofTs army do not mean any reL
tardation in his advance. On the cond
trary his progress continues without
- intermission. The broad corridor
- for.med by our break through in the
l? direction of Lutsk continues to widen
" and is assuming an enveloping cnard
acter in relation to the enemy's flank.
? The advance, however, cannot go on
" indefinitely at the present speed, for
the element of unexpectedness to which
Y was due much of its early success cannot
be maintained for the period of a
fortnight. Stops must be made for ren
moving the wounded and prisoners, for
bringing up fresh supplies and for other
work necessary in the freshly
elongated lines of communication.
_ Would Destroy Enemy's Power.
1 "Moreover, the immediate aim of the
e Russian aggression is not to recapture
n certain towns or areas, but has in view
_ the destruction of the vital organs of
s the enemy's military power, which are
. his armies. Our success in this respect
^ could not have a mode eloquent expresi
sion than the growing list of prisoners."
e The Times in an editorial says today:
y "NO phase of last year's operations
equaled Russia's present remarkable
e successes, attained within a period of
a twelve days. It is clear that the Aush
trian armies confronting Russia have
j been rendered incapable of assuming
e any offensive on a great scale during
t the current year. This is a conclusion
of great moment to the allied cause.
IX^any power is approaching undeniable
exhaustion of its resources, that power
is Austria-Hungary. She has extended
the age of military service beyond that
of any other nation, and her internal
economic condition is believed to be
exceptionally bacl."
1 Position of Austria Critical.
r The Graphic says:
5 "The position of Austria is now mora
- critical than at any period since tha
i opening of the war."
* There is yet no official confirmation of
the reported fall of Czernowitz, capital
5 of Bukowina, to the Russians. But it is
rr the usual custom of the Russians to
. withhhM their announcements until all
1 details are full and complete. In connection
with the report of the fall of
Czernowitz the Daily News Petrograd
correspondent says:
"The Austrians before leaving Czernowitz
intrusted a small committee of
1 various nationalities with the duty of
i handing over the town to the Rus.
elans."
