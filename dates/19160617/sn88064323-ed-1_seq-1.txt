HOUSING AND
THE LANDLORD.
By Judson Grenell.
[(Jon tri bated ]
When the Industrial Welfare
Managers' association of the
Board of Commerce is tbrongh
with "studying developments in
'he bousing hue which have been
accomplished in other cities," it
will find, as other like associa
tions have discovered—and usual
ly suppressed—that the "hous
i.ig problem is a "land problem.'
To be told that the wage-earn
eis pay from 25 to .10 per cent of
their wages for reut is an old sto
ry. And thongh it is asserted
that in New York city workmen
pay ouly 15 per cent of their earn
ings for rent, it is extremely im
probable that one section of the
ooontry "suffers" from rent pay
ing to any greater extent than do
others. Such things gravitate to
a common oasis, and it is safe to
say that, the country over, at
least one fifth of all a man earns
goes to the landlord.
Now the landlord iB a dual
character. He is a monopolist
and also a capitalist Sometimes
the teims are synonymous; but in
dealing with the rent problem it
is well to separate them, as to
find a remedy tor either the mono
poly or the charging of usurious
interest, on the capital invested it
is necessary to prescribe different
treatments.
The landlord as a capitalist can
easily be prevented from charging
usurious interest on his capital m
the shape of houses by simply
subjecting him to the competition
of free capital. Stop taxiug
wealth, and more wealth will be
utilized as capital for the building
of booses. Untaxed booses would
increase the number of houses and
competition for tenants would re
dace rents.
While all this is the A, B, C, of
political economy, Is there any
hope that a committee of any
board of commerce, whether locat
ed in Pittsburgh, Chicago, De
troit, or elsewhere, many mem
bers of which make their* living
by speculating in land, and insist
that land shall be taxed low and
wealth be taxed high, will recom
mend to the main body that taxes
be shifted from wealth of privil
ege?
Yes, the bousing problem is a
land problem. And the land
problem is a fundamental, to solve
which is to make many other
reforms such simple propositions
that they will almost reform them
selves. Over two hundred cities
of Great Britain petitioned parlia
ment to be allowed to adequately
t«x land vaines —site values.
Parliament hesitates. Why? For
the same reason that boards of
commerce will hesitate to make
any sncb recommendation. Eveiy
member dabbling in real estate—
and bow many are not dabbling?
—will rise np and cry: "Tax con
sumption; workingmen pay the
taxes on consumption. Don't tax

THE CHECK CAME BACK
Mr. Vic. M. Aubry, Deputy
Sheriff, went down to Morgan
City the early part of this week,
arrested one it. G. Robertson, and
brought him baok here to stand
rrial on'the charge of getting
mouey on a "no good" cheek.
Robertson came here representing
himself as a lawyer from Parvis,
Misa. He waa looking tor the
heira of certain nnolalmed funds.
When about concluding bis labors
here he secured the endorsement
of Mr. Fred. W. Bauman to his
o*n check, drawn against the La.
mar County Bank for the snm of
i25 00. The ebeek was cashed
and Robertson departed, going
East.
In due time the check was re
turned to the bank here as being
no good. Mr. Banman had to
make that check good to the bank
here. The facta were laid before
the Sheriffs Office and Mr. Anbry
was detailed to look Mr. Robert,
eon np and get him to explain the
matter. By the employment of
the wires the drawer of the check
was soon located and brought
baek to this place to meet the
charge of obtaining money on
bogus cbeck.

AN APPEAL TO
THE SPIRIT OF
"OLD GLORY."
By J. Dreyfus.
Wbat is a Flag? A rag that
symbolizes national greed, ambi
tion, power and glory? A piece of
buutiog reflecting the soldier's va
lor and the conqueror's crown;
the tyrant's strength, the despair
of the slave? A widely accepted
fetich embracing in its folds dy.
nastic distinies, national servi
tude, the ruthless march of the
autocrat over people's hopes and
aspirations? Yes, some flags have
waved over oppressed lands, have
wafted death to all aspiring to
wards freedom, towards national
consciousness.
Some flags even incarnate the
spirit of absolutism, of sworn enmi
fy to progress and enlightenment,
of the involuntary enslavement of
peoples and nations But »this
flag, with its sparkling 6tars and
stripes, was born in the cradle of
liberty, rocked by the hand of
righteousness and raised and
grown to protect and defend de.
mocracy, the mass of men, hu
manity. It has its roots in the
soil of no tradition, of no warrior's
history, of no dynastic struggles,
of no class privileged clan's ex
ploitation and spoliation.
It grows from the heart of free
man; it draws its nourishment
and life from the spirit of justice
aud righteousness of the nation.
It needs no external protection,
no sword for its respect, no exhor
tatioos for its love.
Government, soldier and orator
may cease their function, old glory
would still evoke devout woiship,
thunderous applause from the
millions whose spirit of freedom is
crystalized in its folds Its stars
are more lustrous and inspiring
than those blinking in the firma
ment. They draw tbeir light
from the sonl of a free nation;
they illuminate and flood the path
of the soul of all nations. Wher
ever oppression's cry is raised;
persecution's wail made the rater's
hymn of hate, this flag shines
brighter than the star of hope,
penetrates deeper into the consci
ence of mankind than the promis
ed redemption of the reformed
sinner. Idol worshippers yet de.
ride its sublime sweep; followers
of Baal and Mammon execrate its
noble appeal. Bat no passion, no
prejudice, however impulsive, ir
resistible they may be, dare put
the impious hand on its pure col
ors to trail it m the mire and
slime of greed and selfishness.
The iconoclast, m reckless mood
and temper of despair, wonld not
desecrate the emblem's mute ap
peal Oar flag embodies more
than the natiou's struggle from
childhood to maturity, more than
a citizen's assertion of equal
rights and privileges. The en.
chanting mnaio_of the stars played
on the stripes is the voice of love,
of jnstice, of universal brother
hood. It is not a symbol of ag
gression, of force, of ambition; it
is a beacon light of peace, good
will and contentment. It stands
for an ideal of government, for a
national aoul which encircles the
universe. Its broad and world
wide spirit of divine rights of
men and nations is being accepted
by prophet, philosopher and sa
vant.
It is being defended and pre
served by the inner consciousness
of inau without appeal to force,
save that force and strength of in
tellect which pat justice above
nation and right above power.
The ideal of oar government, the
national consciousness of oar de
mocracy for which this flag is be
ing publicly idolized is at present
being seriously challenged by the
poisonous dragon of militarism
whose venimons fangs has steep
ed Enrope into a cataclysm which
threatens to obliterate old concep
tions of international relations
and old rights of national exist
ence. Very soon the nation, the
genuine American, will know
what side should predominate.
With sword and fire and destruc
tion, might will gradually assault
oar ramparta, onr breastworks,
only to reoeive, I confidently
iiope, the death thrast, which I
know, brave men born of a genu
ine patriotism and love of conn
try, oan so successfully deliver.
Patriotism is not an '' empty word,
only filling space and attention in
the coward's vocabulary. It may
mean stern dnty, sacrifice of com
fort, hardships, wounds and pains,
bat the blood of the authors of
the constitution and the déclara
tion of independence tingling in
onr veins will again meet and
solve the problem. The process

Washington, May —A machine
I which plants from 10 to 15 thou
saud forest tree seedlings a day is
|dow being used at the Letcbwonb
j ParkForest and Arboretum,in VVyo
ming Couuty, N Y , according to
officials of the Forest Service who
are acting as advisers in the work.
Previously the plant has been
done by hand at the rate of 1,200
to 1,500 tiees each day per man.
The machine was designed to
set out cabbage and tomato
plants, but works rqually well
with trees. It is about the size of
an ordinary mowing machine and
is operated by three men and two
horses One man drives the
team while the other two handle
the seedlings. The machine
makes a furrow in which the trees
are set at any desired distance,
and aotomatic device indicates
where they should be dropped.
Two metal tiled wheels push aud
roll the dirt firmly down around
the roots. Tins is a very desira
ble feature, it is said, because the
trees are apt to die if this is not
well done. Two attachments
make it possible to place water
aud fertilizer at the roots of each
seedling Auother attachment
marks the line on which the next
row of trees is to be planted.
No cost figures are available
yet, bur officials say that the cost
will be less than when the plant
ing is done by hand It is stated
that the machine can be used on
aDy land which has been cleared
aud is not too rough to plow and
barrow.

Smile and the world may smile
with yon—but gloom, it's a cinch
you'll play solitaire! —Paragraphs
of preparedness, so thoroughly ad -
vocated by all men of national
statnre and distinction may be the
preliminary test to answer the
uballenge of aimed autocracy.
Will Americanism supinely suffer
an invasion of that frightful for
eign kultur and a clash of ideals
without shedding a tear below the
folds of old glory?
Americanism is a national tern
per inculcated by the trials and
tribulations of the nation's infan
cy. It has withstood the ravages
and vicissitudes of national storms
and wars of liberation; it will
again meet with increased courage
the new conditions arising from
the continental holocaust aud
with calm deliberation apply its
wisdom and genins to a clean,
thorough readjustment of affaiis
that will promise permanent, last
ing peace.
This is wbat onr flag waves
ovet; the spirit of righteousness,
of justice, of brotherly love whicl
this nation insists, should prevail
and predominate everywhere, ii
the dark corners as well as those
bathed in the effulgent light of
contact of the whole universe.
As long as the ragged civic pride,
the moral and spiritual strength
of national manhood maintain the
high honor of onr national life
and strengthen with that moral
life-giving energy the silent, deep
sonl of the nation, old glory re
mains the typical monument, the
eloquent sentinel of the destiny of
the United States.
"FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES."
What means that banner floating
there
With bars of red and white so fair?
Those brilliant stars of the States de
clare
Whose equal is not found elsewhere.
United by a bond to hold
Brave men who're made ia freedom's
mold.
They're held by bonds—not galling
chains; .
Nor selfish greed that leaves a stain;
But matual good a commonwealth
Of brain and brawn and moral health.
Justice and Right its rule shall be
Where'er it floats o'er land and sea
Therc'a red, red blood, so true and
pure
Twas shed for Right which shall en
dure;
It came from hearts untouched by
stain.
Thank God! A sacrifice not vain.
It still flows on, 'twill never tire,
A.hallowed stream, by freedom's
shrine.
Where'er it waves, o'er land or sea,
Justice and Right its rule shall be.
Flag of the free! Flag of the brave!
Hearts beat in tune its life to save.
Brains, never tire, thus make it strong;

says Mrs. Sylyania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky., In
writing of her experience with Cardul, the woman's
tonic. She says further: "Before I began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, I
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardui, I began to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
I wish every suffering woman would give
CARDUI
The Woman's Tonic
a trial. I still use Cardui when I feel a little bad,
and It always does me good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are Sure signs of woman
