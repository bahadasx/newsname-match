STATE INSTITUTIONS.
Being one of a series of 12 spe
cial articles for the Examiner,
prepared by W. H. Cochran, mem
ber of the state board of control.
The blind children of this state
were formerly housed with the deaf
children and all were under the di
rection of the superintendent of tho
State School for Defective Youth.
The achool was established on Feb
ruary 3rd, 1886, and was under the
management of a board of trustees
and did not come under the jurisdic
tion of the Board of Control until
October Ist, 1900.
At that time Ernest Lister, now
governor, was chairman of the
Board of Control. He recommended
to the 1903 legislature that the
feeble-minded children be establish
ed at another point, that the blind
children be segregated from the deaf
and that the former be given the
quarters then used by the feeble
minded. This board further recom
mended that the name of the school
be "The State School for the Deaf
and Blind." The recommendation
was not followed at that session,
but after being recommended by an
other board, the J. 905 legislature,
adopted it.
In September, 1902, report there
were but 14 blind children in attend
ance at the school, and one teacher
was all that was required for the in
struction of these. In the 1904 re
port this attendance had increased
to 23.
Owing to the fact that the state
of Idaho had up to this time made no
provision for the care of its deaf and
blind, our school cared for a number
of Idaho children in the Washington
institution. The sum charged the
state of Idaho was $200 for each child
for the school term, and they receiv
ed the same care and attention as
those of this state.
While the law transferring the
feeble-minded children elsewhere
was passed in 1905, the buildings
were not completed at the new loca
tion so that the transfer could be
made until May, 1906. Immediately
the blind children were removed to
the buildings vacated, and there was
to all intents and purposes a separate
blind school and a separate deaf
school, although under the same
management and classed as "The
State School for the Deaf and
Blind."
At the time of the transfer the
population of the blind school had
grown to 31, sixteen of whom had
become afflicted with blindness at
the age of one year or less. Two
years later, or at the beginning of the
1908 term, the number of students
had increased to 37.
The 1909 legislature was request
ed by the board to separate the two
schools, and that one be known as
the School for the Deaf, and the
other to be known as the School for
the Blind. The reason for this re
quest was that the schools had both
grown so rapidly in population that
it required one 'superintendent to
look after the deaf and one to look
after the blind. Dating from this
recommendation the two' schools
were conducted separately, although
the law dividing them was not passed
until the 1913 session of the legisla
ture.
In September, 1913, W. B. Hall,
superintendent of the Kansas State
School for the blind, was induced to
come to this state and become the
head of this institution. Mr. Hull
was one of the foremost men in the
work in the United States, and It was
a great loss to the school and to this
state when he passed away last fall.
His widow, who had been his
valuable helpmate throughout his
life's work, was immediately appoint
ed to succeed htm, and she 1b now the
superintendent of this Institution.
In a tribute paid to the memory
of Mr. Hall, the first superintendent
of this Institution, at the recent lay
ing of the cornerstone of the new
building being erected there, Hon. T.
E. Skaggs, member of the State Board
of Control, had the following to say:
"I need not describe in detail the
two years' work that have meant so
much, not only to our blind children,
but to the adult blind, who, last
year for the first time, were permit
ted to enjoy the benefits of the sum
mer school. You all know how his
splendid executive ability, business
judgment, thorough training and
tireless energy have brought this ins
titution up to a degree of efficiency
that places it In the front rank of
the blind schools of the nation. It
Is sufficient for me to say that
every hope entertained by the gov
ernor and the Board of Control has
been realized In full, and I betray no
confidence when I tell you that no
Institution under our management
gives lens concern nor more causa for
gratification than this.
"Standing in the light of such a
life, I could not close without saying
something that is in your mind and
mine. If we could draw aside the
veil and hear our brother in audible
tones, this would be his message:
" 'Twenty-three years ago, among
thp sunflowers of Kansas, God gave
Into my keeping the destinies of a
pure and beautiful woman. With a
common purpose, our lives enriched
by love, we set out on life's sea, our
hearts entwining and tho union grow
iiiK with years. All through life,
whether in sunshine or rain, in win
ter's chilling blast or summer's
warming zephyr, she bore more than
her share of the burden. I covet
nothing of honor or praise for ray-
Belt', for I have already heard those
welcome words, 'Well done, good and
faithful servant, but it is my earnest
wish that all credit and praise for
whatever of success may have at
tended my labors may be richly
■hared by her.'
■Therefore, in honoring him, we
do well to honor this brave, talented,
Christian woman, who took up the
burden when he laid it down and
added it to that which she already
bore. But we should not feel that,
With this encomium our duty is end
ed. As citizens, as friends, as breth
ren, we must add our strength and
support to her energy, activity and
genius, that her achievements of the
future may equal their combined
triumps of the past."
There ure 20 employes of this
school, including teachers, Mrs. Sadio
E. Hall being the superintendent. The
school now has a population of 63
students, of which King county fur
nishes the largest number of any
county in the state, namely, 12. Lew
is and Whatcom counties each fur
nish seven; Clarke, six; Spokane,
Walla Walla and Yakima, four each;
BnohomUh, Skagit and Pierce, three
each; C'owlitz and Lincoln, two each;
and tho following counties are repre
sented by but one each: Chehalis,
Columbia, Klickitat, Pacific. Pend
Orielle and Whitman.
The ages of the children run from
six to 21, although there are at pres
ent six who are slightly over 21.
The value of the state property at
tliis institution is estimated at $68,
--162.39, which, of course, does not
include the new building now being
erected.
The School for the Blind is located
in the city limits of Vancouver, and
just on the ed«e of the city. The
state owns here 5.16 acres of land,
which is entirely inadequate, as with
the growth of. the school more will
need be acquired. The school term
is for nine months of the year and is
open to any blind person of this state
under the age of 21 years.
During the three summer mouths
we hold a term of that period for the
adult blind. Last year, 1918, was the
first that this state had ever made
provision for teaching the adult
blind, and about 20 took advantage
of it. It is our understanding that
there Is no other summer school for
the adult blind in the United States
outside this state and the state of
Minnesota, and the establishment of
this summer school, which will be a
regular feature each year, is one of
our achievements of which we are
justly proud.
The parents and friends must pay
the railroad fares of the students to
and from the school und must furnish
their clothing, shoes, etc. The state
furnishes all of the maintenance and
supplies the Instruction free of
charge. There are no tuition fees.
There are many blind children in the
state whose parents have never avail
ed themselves of the privileges of
the school and this Is to be won
dered at. It Is an Ideal place for the
young ones thus handicapped and
every child in the state should by all
means be sent here and Instructed.
The superintendent is a good, Chris
tian woman, whose every thought is
for "her children," as she calls them,
and the children love her and always
aim to conduct themselves so that it
gives her pleasure.
The administration or school
building Is an old dilapidated struc
ture, but we are at present building,
and will have ready for occupancy at
the beginning of the next term in
September, one of the most modern
and up-to-date structures for the
blind in all of the Western states.
The sum of 176,000 was appropriated
for this building by the last legisla
ture and the Board of Control ap
pointed as architects Jullutt A. Zlt
tel, of Spokane, and Dennis Nichols,
of Vancouver, and let the contract
for the erection of the same to S. C.
Krirkmm, of Tacoma.
The new building will have three
stories and a full basement and will
be strictly fire proof. On the first
floor will be the students' dining
room, also dining rooms of the teach-
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
era and the superintendent; linen
room, drug room, offices, superin
tendent's quarters, guest rooms for
the Governor und Board of Control
niciulicfs and a reception room. Ou
th<> accond floor will be the audi
torium, class and recitation rooms.
On the third floor will be the teach
ers' iiiid officers' bed rooms. In the
basement will be the plunge, where
swimming will be taught to overy
pupil; the gymnasium, manual art
trnining room, wrestling dens and
dressing rooms for both the boy and
the girl pupils. The building will
have a roof garden for the benefit of
tho teachers.
Other buildings at the school are
a boys' dormitory and a girls' dormi
tory. Both of theße buildings are
fire proof. The population of the
school has grown, however, bo that
another dormitory is now needed, es
pecially for the boys as that building
is filled to overflowing. There is a
first-class engine and boiler house
which was constructed by the Board
of Control when the present gover
nor, lOrnest Lister, wns a member of
tlie board.
It is difficult for the public in gen
eral to understand how much the
sightless can really accomplish in a
practical way. One thinks of tho
blind as simply folding their hands
and sitting in idleness and as being
a constant object of care. At our
School for the Blind the girls make
pillow cases, aprons, sheets, towels,
napkins and laundry bags. They also
make hammocks, study typewriting
and make all kinds of fancy work.
The boys make hammocks, nets,
runs, cane chairs, brooms and tune
pianos. We recently supplied other
institutions with brooms which were
made by the boys of this institution.
Tin; children do some of the work
about the place. All make their own
beds; the girls wash and dry the
dishes in the pupils' dining room; the
hoys split and take wood to the kitch
en and assist in keeping the yard
clean. The difficulties in training
blind children are very great.
Strangely, the industry in which the
blind seem to bo most successful is
one which depends upon the accurate
employment of colors in harmonious
arrangement, the weaving of art fab
rics. The education of the blind is
yet In its infancy and the future will
Bee Hix-at strides in the way of edu
cation as well as in the matter of
prevention,
Ii lias been our endeavor to bring
about systematic and accurate teach
ing in all departmenti of the school.
To provide for the educational needs
of the talented, the mediocre and the
dull, requires patience, energy and
Charity upon the part of all. Wo be
lieve that the bright pupils are now
better provided for than they ever
have been. We know that the medi
ocre and the dull are receiving far
more Intelligent help and attention.
To bring about a well graded school
requires years of patient effort.
Higher standards are required in the
school and the children generally are
eager for study and use every means
at hand for thorough preparation.
Tho division of the study hour so
that pupils would not need to study
so long at any one time and the es
tablishment of the reading hour has
brought about very beneficial re
sultH. Instead of haphazard read-
Ing to pupils of all ages, the school
is divided into three groups, accord-
Ing to ability to Interpret and ap
preciate literature. Magazine arti
cles and current events are thus pre
sented to our young people. Under
this tuition, If a child passes several
years in the school, his life will be
cultured with good literature and his
vision broadened with a knowledge
of world events.
That a large part of the blindness
Is due to Optholmla Neonatorlum,
contracted at birth, and that this
might be avoided If the law requiring
the physician attending at birth to
drop a diluted solution of nitrate of
silver In the eye of the new born
babies, (the statement of Dr. Rich
ards, which startled New York), Is
absolutely true, according to Edward
B. Allen, of Watertown, superintend-
ent of the Perkins Institution. Many
iii< ■. ni.i ii. do t ins nowadays.
