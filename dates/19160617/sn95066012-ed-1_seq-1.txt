For eighteen local boys and pirlH,
liiKh school is a thing of memory.
Commencement or the finish took
place in high school hull last evening.
Iiefore an audience of proud parents
and interested friends which packed
the auditorium to the aisles, corridors
and steps, the uraduatiim program
passed off without an incident to mar
the even tenor of its way.
The exercises should have heen held
in the opera house. The school hall
was auRrevatiiiRly inadequate to
handle the large crowd. This was
realized almost a half hour before the
high school orchestra began the over
tare which opened the exercises.
l'ho graduating class was composed
of Miss Hilda I. Hurley, Miss Mary
Elizabeth Hutton, Miss Abbie C. Lil-
lie, Miss Julia Jane Lillie, Miss Hazel
V. Levin, Miss Kuth 1). Mason, Miss

Spencer Lee, T. Kenneth Fauley and
Edward F. Ilorst.
They marched up the center aisle by
couples during the playing of the open
1ng piece by the high Bchool orchestra.
They separated in front of the stage
one file going on to the platform at
the left side nnd one at tho right,
Supt. A. V. Varney, Principal F. 1
Mabrey and Hev. V. tl. Towart also
took seats upon the platform. All of
the girls were gowned in white and the
tableau of the stage arrangement of
the class on a platform banked with
daisies and swamp-flag and lighted by
the high school system of indirect
lighting, made an exceptional pretty
and unusual picture.
Following invocation by Hev. W. fi
Towait, Miss Kuth Dean Mason opened
the program of commencement essays
and addresses by a paper on "Glimpses
of Japanese Life." She spoke very
distinctly and with excellent enuncia
tion. Her essay touched on various
phases of lile in the land of the Chrys
anthemum, dress, family life and mar
riage. She was heavily applauded
Thomas Kenneth Fauley next of
fered a fifteen minute- address on the
opportunities of Vermont, under tho

Starting with a cursory history of the
state he discussed at length the in
dustries in which the commonwealth
stands paramount. The apple Indus
try, the dairying Industry, forestry and
farming received brief attention, the
speaker emphasizing that the present
graduating class would have these
problems before them nnd that the
rising generation would be responsible
for their solution.
flic speaking was interspersed with
vocal and instrumental music, Miss
gnes May lientley rendering a solo

orchestra. She possesses a clear sweet
soprano voice and she was enthusiasti
cally applauded.
.Miss Marion Lena needier read a
paper on "folk wo loucii in Passing

Various characters in classical fiction
pattlcularly In Stevenson's books and
compared them to various characters

call to the appreciation of books and

Ml for Two Cents" was tho title of
nn essay on newspapers nnd ncwo
paper-making given by Miss Irene
Mary lterard. She called attention
to the limited news facilities of a cen
tury ago as contrasted with those of

tors entering Into the creation of Utf
modern newspaper. Among them slu:
recited the varous press associations,

staffs composed of specialists, of ad

there would be no formal graduatin
exercises in the coming December
they participated in the program of I
the evening. Principal Mabrey alno
rtated that tho class had departed
somewhat from their usual program.
Hecause of the prize which Uev. Thorn
ton F. Turner had given for the best
essay on the "Value of the Cultural
Studies In lCducation," the prize win
ning article would be read by its au
thor, Miss Marlon Hathaway, although
Miss Hathaway waB not a member of
the class. Miss Hathaway followed
Mr, Mabrey's Introduction with the
prize essay. The article is an excep
tional piete of work and Miss Hatha-
way's clear and concise delivery
doubled Its strength.
Kdward II. Jenney, president of the
class, began his valedictory nddress by
a ten minute discussion of the forests
of Vermont and the shameful manner
in which the great trees that once cov
ered the Green Mountains had been
slaughtered by thoughtless lumbering

WILSON PL IF ill

HI SI. I
Suffrage Plank Narrowly Escaped
Rejection By the Builders
UNDERWOOD TARIFF ENDORSED
Affirmation of Monroe Doctrine and
Policy Toward Mexico Greeted
With Prolonged Applause.
St. Louis, June 17. .Vance McCor-
mlck was today elected chairman of
the national democratic committee,
after a six hour light by members who
objected to the selection of a chairman
from outside the committee.
St. Louis, Mo., Juno 17. The demo
cratic, national convention finished its
work yesterday by" adopting the
party platform exactly as approved by
President Wilson and submitted by
the resolution committee including-
the plan on Americanism and that fav
orlng woman suffrage, but not until
the harmony of its three days' bcssIoiis
hnd been disturbed with a row over
the suffrage plank. No voice was
raised against tho vigorous declara
tions of the Americanism plank, but at
one time It looked as If the suffrage
plank had been lost. After Senator
Walsh of Montana had told the conven
tion that President Wilson himself
considered it vital to party success,
however, it was voted Into the plat
form by a ballot of 888 1-2 to 181 1-2.
The entire platform then was adopt
ed without roll-roll.
As it went Into the platform the
suffrage plank stands: "We favor
Hie extention of tho franchise to the
women of this country, state by state
on the same terms as to the men.'
The woman suffrage leaders consider
ed it a much more favorable declara
tion than they got from the republican
convention at Chicago
The fight ou the HsuTtrage plunk
broke immediately after the presenta
tion of the minority report against (lie
administration plank.
In an impatient speech Senator
Walsh swept aside the smaller ques
tions which had been injected into the
fight, ami told the delegates that
President Wilson himself knew the
plank was In the platform and consid
ered it essential for party victory.
While the fifcht had been going on,
a thunderstorm burst, and when the
row on the convention floor was at Its
height tho stcrni reached its climax.
The booming of the thunder, mixed
with the roaring shouts on the floor
and the clatter caused by the rain on
the toof, almost drowned out the
speakers. The storm cleared Just as
Senator Walsh finished speaking, and
the closing words of his plea for the
administration plank swept a change
of sentiment over the crowd as wel
come to the suffragists as the wave of
cod, refreshing air that poured down
into the Coliseum.
In the reading of the platform Indorse
ment of the I'nderwood tariff act was
given general applause. The delegates
stemed too wearied to interrupt wiih
prolonged applause. The niuch-dis-
cussed plank on Americanism, drawn
by President Wilson himself, was next
read. It was Interrupted by handclap
ping. Its denunciation of conspirators
for the advancement of foreign In flu
ence in this country was roundly ap
iilauded. Declarations for military
preparedness were also uniformly ap
plauded.
The Latin-American policy planli
got seme applause but more greeted
the Mexican plank and frequently in
terrupted its rending, especially the
reaffirmation of the Monroe doctrine
The assertion that American troops
should he kept In Mexico until danger
of raids subsided, was loudly applaud
ed. The nssertlon that Intervention
Is a "last recourse" received applause
but generous approval was given to
the "indorsement of the president's
attempt to prevent Intervention. After
concluding the Mexican plank Sen
ntor Walsh was "spelled," as Senator
Stone characterized it, in the reading
of the platform, by Senator 1 loll is
When tho woman suffrage plank was
reached tho galleries started a demon
stratlon. Prolonged cheers, applause
and whistling followed its reading,
emphasized by Senator llollis. The
suffrage plank got more of a demon
stratlon from the men tlmn it did from
the women.
The nailing of the platform was
finished at l.'-'rt. There were cheer
and the band struck up again. Chair
man Stone then moved the adoption
of the platform ns rend. There were
some cries of "Vote it down!" There
were other cries of "Shut up!" Mar
tin M. Lomasney, a Massachusetts
delegate, objected to the adoption.
After a wrangle Senator Stone yield

time.
it. turned nut that Lomasney want

sympathy of the convention with "the

PLAYGROUND OPENS MONDAY
Season to Start With the Organization
of Self-Government Club.
To all the children who have been
so anxiously inquiring, notico is here
by tiven that the Playground will open
Monday afternoon at 2 o'clock. Owing
to the rainy weather, it has been found
quite difficult to get the grounds in
proper condition ami have the appara
tus painted and repaired, however, by
Monday, everything will be in readi
ness and tho Playground staff will be
on hand to greet the happy children.
Chauncey Mann, just graduated from
Springfield college, will be there to
organize the boys' baseball leagues,
and coach all of the boys' activities in
general. Miss Kathryn Dunham will
play with the little folks and supervise
the hand work, while Miss Mathilde
Vossler will take charge of the girls,
as usual.
'It is hoped that every child and
young person in liennington who ex
pects to use the Playground in any
way this summer, will be present on
Monday so that a complete registra
tion of names may be obtained at this
time. At 3 o'clock there w ill be a gen-
eral assembly to elect oflicers of the j
new Playground council which is to bo
formed ttiis year. This season will
surely be better than ever on the play
ground and no child will want to miss
any of the fun, so be sure to plan to
start right in at the beginning. In
case of rain, the opening will be held
on Tuesday.
Roland Joseph Taylor A Tribute
In the fall of 1904, I opened a law
oflice In tho savings bank building of
this town. Dating from about this
time, my acquaintance with Roland J.
Taylor began, and I soon came to count
him as one of my best friends. The
friendship continued until his death.
During all these years, with the joys
and sorrows incident thereto, few have
been the days that I have missed his
ever cordial greeting. AVhen the snow s
of winter piled high upon the roadway,
or its surface became a glare of ice,
we rested content as we rode by the
sldo of our friend, whom we well knew
to be not only a skilled horseman, but
expert reinsman.
A few years ago. "A guest came to
the home of our friend, a guest unhid."
There were days and weeks when
Fhadows gathered about the home he
loved so well, and his physical condi
tion caused great anxiety. Then, there
came days when the silent messenger
seemed farther away, and our friend
was about his business as usual. There
are those who attract us by their kind
ly and cheery ways, and who are ever
loyal in their Iriendship. Mr. Taylor,
when sorely tried could speak plainly,
but it was always in your presence,
no poison shaft of nialiee came from
his lips to strike you in the back.
Within that rugged frame beat a heart
as kind and tender as that of a little
liild. In his business career ho
was attentive and honorable In all his
dealings. Many are living in our town.
who for neatly three decades pat
ronized Mr. Taylor. His home was his
castle, nnd as a loving husband ami
fattier his name will be tenderly
herished.
Since tho new year came, "The Reap
er, has been busy in our vicinity, and
le harvest has been unusually abund
ant. Mr. Taylors funeral, on Wednes
day last, was largely attended. The

quisite hymn. "Lead Kindly Light."
still ringing in our ear, with the sun
light of the lovely June afternoon
streaming into the attractive church
interior, we looked for the last time,
upon tho face of our old time friend,
realizing that
"This is not our place of resting,"
Our's a City, yet to come,
Onward to it we are hastening
On to our Eternal Home.

Gen. Trevino Warns Commander
of American Forces in Mexico
BUCK DOOR ALONE IS OPEN
Every Route Closed to Primitive Ex
pedition Except the Way Home
to the United States.
Chihuahua, June 17. Cen. Jacinto
Trevino. commanding the Carranza
army of the north, yesterday advised
Gen. J. J. Pershing, American expedi
tionary commander, that any move
ment of American troops in Mexico
from their present lines to the south,
east or west would be considered a
hostile act and a signal to commence
warfare. (Jen Trevino acted upon
specific instructions from Carranza.
The only new development in the
Laredo situation, as shown by over
night dispatches to den. Funston's
headquarters in San Antonio, Tex.,
was Cen Ricaut's action in ordering
1000 de facto government troops into
the territory opposite San Ignacio to
pursue bands who attacked American
troops. In notifying United States
military officials of the step, Ricaut
expressed regret that the attack had
been made, and gave warning that if
American troops crossed the border
Cairanza forces would attack.
All American troops stationed in EI
Paso, Tex., and its environs were or
dered to quarters last night, to be held
under arms until further notice. The
orders followed reports to military
headquarters that placards printed in
Spanish had been posted In Juarez,
instructing citizens to gather at desig
nated points daily to receive military
instruction so that they may be pre
pared to repel possible invasion. The
notice was signed by Jesus Valdez, a
private citizen, who said ho wished his
people to "be prepared in the event of
a break witli the United States."
Dispatches from Chihuahua City
that Cen. Trevino had notified Gen.
Pershing that any movement of his
command other than in a northerly
direction would be construed as a
hostile act, aroused no apprehension
among army officials at El Paso, Tex.,
last night. It was asserted that the
expeditionary command is amply pre
pared to care for itself in any even
tuality.
ECHOES FROM MAN
CHESTER CENTER
Manchester Center Happenings Always
' Interest Our Readers.
After reading of so many people in
cur town who have been cured by
Doan's Kidney Pills, the question na
turally arises: "Is this medicine equal
ly successful in nearby places?" The
generous statement of this Manchester
Center resident leaves no room for
doubt on this point.
James Kennedy, Manchester Center
Vt., says: "For years my back and
kidneys bothered mo and the trouble
became so bad at times, that I could
hardly stoop or straighten. Mornings
when 1 first got up, my back was lame
and stiff and pains extended from my
kidneys Into my loins and hips. The
kidney secretions were unnatural and
I was really in bail shape when I be
gan using Doan's Kidney Pills. They
helped mo at once and it was not long
before they had fixed mo up in good
shape. My back was strengthened
the pains were removed nnd my health
was restored. Whenever I have felt
in need of a kidney medicine since
have taken a few doses of Doan's Kid
ney Pills and have received benefit.'
