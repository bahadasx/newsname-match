Ike Habit of Happiness
Can you imagine anything that would make the one
toothed, half-blind, sodden and shriveled wrecks of the slums
burst out in laughter? It would have to be mighty funny,
wouldn't it?
Hut that's what Douglas Fairbanks did in this latest
Triangle Play. H<* made the old men who hadn't smiled in
years roar with laughter over his inimitable antics.
You will enjoy following him on the screen and you
too will laugh as you watch this corking play.

St. Louis, June L r >.—Woodrow
Wilson was re-nominated at 11
p. m. to-night by the democratic
national convention.
When Judge AV'esteott of New
Jersey had placed the president
in renomination and the nomina
tion had been seconded by former
Governor Harmon of Ohio and
Governor Stuart of Virginia, the
delegates wanted to wait no long
er and cried: "Vote, vofe."
On motion of Senator Hughes
of New .Jersey, the rules were sus
pended and no ballots whatever
were taken. The delegates sim
ply roared "aye" when the names
of Wilson and Marshall were
called and Chairman James de
clared them nominated by aecla
mation.
fSenator Kern in nominating (
Vice President Marshall discarded 1
a long prepared speech and sim
ply said:
"I re-nominate Thomas
Marshall.

Tho nominations of both can
didates were completed four min
utes before midnight.
Robt. E. Burke a "Lonsome Man.
Robert Emmett Burke of
nois, a delegate, who announced
he would not vote for the presi
dent, raised the only voice in op
position. ITe had been elected as
an independent.
Many delegates an<J spectators
made a rush of the exits when
the vice-presidential nomination
was «bade, anrf in the contusion
Senator James, with great diffi
culty, restored order.
Resolutions were then read and
adopted appointed Senator James
and former Governor Glynn of
New York, chairman of commit
tees respectively, to notify the
president and vice-president of
the nominations.
Senator Hughes, Taggart and
Vardaman were appointed to con
fer with the platform committee,
which still was in session, to learn
if it was ready to report.
Practically all of the delegates
remained, but the galleries emp
tied quickly.
Speakers Filled in for Crowd.
Senator Lewis of Illinois was
then called to the platform to fill
in the wait with a speech.
Senator Lewis, however, cut it
short and merely thanked the
crowd for its applause. The crowd
wanted somebody to talk, and
there were cries of "Tom Heflin"
and " Irvin Cobb." Heflin took
the platform.
While Heflin was talking, the
conferees returned from the plat
form committee and reported that
the platform would not be ready
for the convention for two or
three hours more.
Senator Hughes recommended
adjournment.
Heflin amused the crowd with
a story.
"An old negro in Washington
the other day," said he, "asked
'Who did the republicans nomi
nate?'
" 'Mr. Hughes,' he was told.
Yas so. Who do vus suppose
the white folks will nominate?' "
The southern delegation led the
uproar that followed. When
Heflin finished Senator Hughes
reported that the platform com
mittee was not ready to report.
The subcommittee was aerecd. he
said, but the entire committee
was not assembled. Motions to
recess were called out from the
floor. Tt finally was agreed to
meet again at 11 a. in.
Applause was given to Judge
Wescott's remarks while nomi
nating Wilson on the policy to
ward Mexico. The crowd was at
tentive and quiet. It voiced ap
proval of America's maintenance
of international law. Some of
the crowd, however, were eager
for the nomination.
Name him, name lfim," came
cries from the galleries.
Judge Wescott had been speak
ing with great deliberation, but
began to hurry Iiis speech a little.
Wfhile Judge Wescott was
speaking some of the Tammany
delegates still barred out i»y the
police and not to lie thwarted so
easil}, sent a telegram to < hair
man James inside the Coliseum.
It was delivered to him on the
platform and he sent a rescue
party to bring them in.

Restored to Good Health.
"I was sick for four years with

Otto Gans, Zanesville, Ohio
lost, weight and felt so weak that
I almost gave up hope of being
cured. A friend told me about
Chanvberlain's Tablets, and since
using two bottles of them I have
been a well woman." Obtainable
everywhere.
"Lucky" and "unlucky" have
come to be applied to gathering
blossoms, to horseshoes, to the
color of hair, to your manner of
"saying things"—in a word, to
every possible event in life. It
is unlucky to have a dead blos
som; it is unlucky to go out with
your shoelaces untied,—the later
we naturally believe; it is un
lucky to brinsr hawthorn blos
soms within the house ; it is lucky
to hear the cricket.
The latter is, of course, sup
posed to bring luck into the
house
Very lucky it is to find a spider
on your clothes; it is called a
money spinner in many parts of
the country.
Feather beds should not be
turned on a Sunday. If your
teeth grow widely apart you will
be a traveler. If you have a mole
on vour back you will have money
by the sack.
Caesar, Napoleon, Bismarc'«
and others were not above the
superstition of lucky and unlucky
days. Thursday was the unlu-ky
days. Thursdav was the unlucky
day of Henry VIII, of his son Ed
ward. and daughters, Mary and
Elizabeth. Isn't it strange that
they all should have died upon
this day? But it is a fact.
Anyhow, what is luckî— Ex.
