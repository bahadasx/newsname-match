ABOUT NORMAL SITE
Twin City Architects in Bemidji to
Make Flans for New Normal
School.
COUNCIL MAY IMPROVE
DIAMOND FOINT FARE
Flans and Reports to Be Made With
in Two Weeks Board Meets
Here August 9.
Johnson, architect, and A. R.
Nichols, landscape engineer, both of
the Twin Cities, were in the city yes
terday and inspected the new normal
school grounds with a view of mak
ing plans for the buildings of the
school and for the park around the
school.
Location Ideal.
Both men stated that they believed
the location of the new sixth normal
school to be ideal.
Mr Nichols was enthusiastic in
regard to the large grounds around
the normal school and the Diamond
Point park.
At an informal meeting of the city
council last evening the two engineers
outlined their plans for the school
and the improvement of the grounds.
They suggested that the city at the
san\ time improve Diamond Point
park on the same plan as the nor
mal school grounds. The suggestion
was received very favorably by mem
bers of the council and it is believed
action will be taken to have the
landscape architect of the normal
school draw plans for the improve
ment of Diamond Point
Board Here August 8.
Plans for the new normal school
and for the normal school grounds
will be completed in several weeks.
Contracts will then be awarded for
the work. The state normal school
board will meet in Bemidji August 8.
The appropriation of $25,000 made
by the state legislature for the new
school here will be available August
first Work on part of the new build
ings and the improving of the grounds
may be begun immediately after Au
gust first.
At a recent meeting of the normal
school board it was decided to ask
the next legislature for an appropria
tion of $250,000 for the construction
of buildings. The buildings will in
clude a main structure, dormitory
and central heating plant.
Best in State.
"The Bemidji site is one of th'e
best in the state," said Architect
Johnson. "For beauty it cannot be
surpassed. Conditions for study are
unequalled. I shall unqualifiedly
recommend it when I appear before
the state normal board Monday."
Not in Underbrush.
"The location is beautiful, perched
there on the shore of the placid and
beautiful Lake Bemidji. I suggested
to the council that the city improve
its park property and the state will
improve its property. The people of
Bemidji do not want their normal
school erected in the underbrush. The
state will cut out much woods from
its land. Immediately after my meet
ing with the state normal board next
Monday I will begin sketching plans
to be ready for ratification at the
state board of control meeting in Au-
gust."

St Louis, Mo, June 17.The
Democratic national convention yes
terday adjourned after adopting the
party platform exactly as approved
By President Wilson and submitted
by the resolutions committee, includ
ing the planks of Americanism and

as if the suffrage plank had been lost,
but after Senator Walsh of Montana

dent Wilson himself considered it
vital to party success, it was voted in
to the platform by a ballot of 888%
to 181%.
No Roll Call.
The whole platform then was
adopted without roll call.
As it went into the platform the
suffrage plank stands:
"We favor the extension of the
franchise to the women of this coun

as to men."
