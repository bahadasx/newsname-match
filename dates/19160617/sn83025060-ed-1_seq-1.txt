Traitors or Patriots

Recent news dispatches x from
Texas, the border state, show a
deplorable lack of patriotism Ton
us, which has hcretobefore begged
to be permitted to whip Mexico
alone, now fails in the pinch, 1 Ier ,

New Mexico she heeds? not the ,
cull, not a single orgranizalion
has been mustered in. More than
a hundred men of the Second
Texas National Guard have flatly
refused to respond.
How different was the response
to the call to lynch, burn at the.
stake, a defenseless Negro. Kif.een
thousand brave murderers to one
to one helpless bound victum.
Texas did heiself proudly that day
She demonstruted her weakness
her cowardice, her savagery, but
when the president called upon
her to send her men out to defend
the ilag, to face the enemy, man
for man, it was another taln to
to tell. Yet the truly biave col
ored soldiers are matching onward
seeking and destroying the enemy
who has terrorized thce samo
brutal cowards These Negroes
are saving Texas only to be re
warded with such ditgnccful and
in human acts as oceured in
Waco a few days ago. As lo
these traitors they are threatened
court martial, but the old "States
Rights" idea is still s-0 dominant
with the present Democratic ad
ministration that ir will be doubt
ful'if the old time Democrat will
submit to asubvisionof Democrat
ic principles in order to puniah
such treasoaablc deielection of
duty.
What does this w'ld "Prepare
dness" cry mean? Is it the hyphe
nated citizen that is refusing to
nphold the American flag, or is
this lack of loyalty only the after
math of the. Civil War and a res
urrection of that old abominable
state rights doctrine that over half
a century ago cost us so many
lives and so miuh money? The
Dick National Guard law paces
the state militian as much under
the command of the President as
is the regular army, lie is the
commander of both. But it is not
authority, but laxity of discipline
and the free sway gives racial
prejudice which i.s our American
point of weakness in the army in
the courts and in the geneul adm.
inistration of affairs.
The militia of the Southwestern
states would respond quic'kly
enough against Negro alive. Jt
would have been easy to have
gotten five thousand Texas Natio
al Guards to Waco before sunrise
to surpress or slaughter the whole
Negro population had there been
any indication that the Negroes
would rise to srevent the burning
of the Negro boy at the stake the
other day .The United State has
spent tens of thousands of doallar
to equip the National Guards of
Texas, Arizona New Mexica, and
these equipments and ammunition
can be turned upon loyal citizen
more quickly and mpro eagerly
than upon foreign invaders, despo
Her nnd assassin The refusal of
the National Guard to obey the

Worthless Negroes
Like all cites we have some
worthless Negroes in Muskogee and
its this class of men and a few
women that cousos friction be
tween the races, when an i.onest
citizen goes out co protect this class
he is certainly going the limit In
order to save tho better elern nt
it becomes thei- duty to put a
quietus upon this worthless element
Sometime ago the writer came
into the city from Reeves Addition
on a late car and o i tho same cur
was a gang of Negro men and
women whose conduct would be a
disgrace in hell, The gang were
colhposoll of thieves thugs, vacs
women of the lowest morals and
stuff like that, this gang of out
laws had gone from the city proper
to hold their orgies uud were on
the return trip, Had any white
person been on the car that night
and objected to the filthy outfit au
they would have had a right to do
then sjtne irresponsible cuss
would have been saying the
wont protect his women. Tohelljbu in bed at home or prepairing lo
with such a en w and tic
sooner the hotter, Its a condition
and not a theory that confronts
us. Any decent woman no nutter
what her color is has tho protection
of our men and to the limit. The
other class wout get it and are not
entitled to it.
The Tu's i Star one of the best
weekly pnpirs in the Southwct.
has become a daily and of course
stands at the head of the class.
We admire Smithermans coinage,
lie is a brilliant young man and
able to make it a success of any
one can, We hope he will get the
patronago he so richly deserves
we are kinder proud of you Andrew
even if we do differ politically,
Cimc or e ics in your success.
If you want to reach the Repu
blican Colored voters you mubt
d) so through the Cimtter. We
reach them all both Republic ins
and Democrats. There are s me
Negro Ijrmocrats buo they like
the Cimeter
The rank and file, the boys at
the crossroars. the fellows in the
Ironches are raising the sinews of
war and before the ides of July or
thereabout we will bring suit in
the U. S. Court and have th.
fellow know, who .would reinflic
the Grandfather law, that every
man black, white or red wheat h r
h can read or not .shall vole at
the next election All we need is
a solid front. The loyal Negroes
are organizing in every school Dist
and the sinews of wur is forth
coming, Let those who have not
organized get in the Rrtme at once.
We must fight our battle we will
win the ballot and then use it for
self protection, use political parties
as a club lo beat down the prejud
ice in our way.
An article from the Muskogee
correspondent to the Tulsa Star
appeared a few days ago that doe?
a great injustice to the Negro men
of Muskogee, among other thing?
tie writer intimates that the
Muskogee men will not defend their
women and cites a case in point
where a colored woman had been
insulted and the men stood idly
by We have made diligent inquiry
and cant find a single thing to
warrant the assertion We ask the
Star to have its corroap n 1 :ti t

The refusal of Col. Roosevelt
to become a canidate and split the
Republican vote makes him one
of the grandest figures in Ameri
can politics and a patriot of the
highest degree. This injures the
election of Mr. Hugos and pros
perity for the American people for
the next four years.
NOT A CHILD
RACE
The assumption, made by thoPo
who wish to rush into the public
prints for purposes of press agent
advertisement or what not, that
the colored race can be classed in
the child races is us assinine as it
is disingenuous.
The race that opened the great
dawn of civilization when the an
cestors of the present day naughty
and supercilious Caucasians were
contentedly enjoying the blessings
of cave existence; the race whose
civilization purified nnd influenced
that of ancient Egypt and frrm
the banks of the Nile was wafted
to Greece and Phoenicia, Rome
and C.rthage may be .said to have
degenerated under thecrul ifluencn

of slavery and the perverse example
tho1 ch,ld races-'f theni is y
such group.
Colored Americans are fully ca.
nftble of self-government, what-
doub'Iess give the white American
u few pointers in self governicni.
It. is not too much to say that
the lynching disgrace, as practis
ed on white men or colored, would
be distinctly discouraged, and, in
fact, totally wiped oui under his
goverment. Of course, to-day and
under the white man's goverment
lie is n square peg in a round hole.
Laws are made that, in except
wheie thy deter his progress and
bar I. is natural ambitions, are not
drawn up with his man. Mea
sures that would improve his men
tality, encourage his industry nnd
mould his morals are never though
of. In fact, such a consummation
would be decidedly unwelcome
with the majority of the law tnakr
if not with the inajs of white peo
ple. Rut Hie mere fact that he is
struggling to fit his square self in
a round hole and that every step
he takes forward is fiercely cotn
battcd by tho demons of race ha
tred and the ungrateful gentleman
of the South is not enough to con
vict him of being a child race.
Americans, least of all, can de
claro such a judgment.

would take an appeal to the supremo,

at the earliest possible time.
Restrains Officials.
The injunction sought by Mr. Gass
ier would restrain the county commis
sioners from paying cluims for print
ing blanks that were used in tho reg
istration of voters under tho new law'.
Tho statu contended that the proper
method for testing the validity of the
law was for some votur who had been '
denied registration to bring the pro
ceedings: that tho injunction to pre
vunt payment of any claim under tho
law was not the proper way.
The above is only u .starter. V
must now get in tho U. S. Court with
an injunction and put u stop to tho
rascal, for all time.
It will take some money to do this.
We must work as well as pray. Let
every loyal Negro get busy and raise
his sbaru. Do it now. It will aud must
bo tiled before July. lOvory man,
whether he can read or not, is entitled
to vote.
We understand our old friend, Hort
Chandler, of Vinita, will be a candi

He is an old-timer nnd we wish him
well.

Sheriff in hell will hold a soireo with

we can't understand where tho loyal
race loving patriots wero when this
outrage was being perpetrated. If
three bravo men had stood for law

never been committed as tho cowardly
mob could havo been dispersed when
hot lead was thrown into their ranks.
The only way to fight tho dovil is with
