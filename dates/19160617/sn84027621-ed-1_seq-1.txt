that Colonel Bell at El Paso reported
to him that General Pershing has
been warned by Gen. Trevino, Car

that any movement of the American
expedition south, east or west would
be the signal for an attack by Mexi

some warning had been sent.

Practically all available United
States troops are on the border or in
Mexico. The militia of three states
are in service. The cruardsmen of

ANOTHER BORDER ALARM
Laredo, June 17. Texas rangers
and armed citizens were rushed to
Islitas, twenty miles up the river to
day on a report that Mexican bandits
had been seen approaching. There
are few details. A body of Carranza
troops is in that vicinity.
. ;
ALMOST AN ULTIMATUM
San Antonio. June 17. The atti
tude of Carranza ' troops is attract
in g the greatest interest of Funston
and his staff. Bandit activities, how
ever, are given careful attention.
Army officers regard Tre vino's warn
ing to Pershing as little less than j
declaration of hostilities since it may
be necessary to send detachments to
pursue bandits menacing outposts at
any time. -

Despite General Ricaul's warning

the border will be attacked, soldiers

AMERICANS ARE READY
Funston's army is so disposed that
swift punitive action could be taken
if invited by an overt act of Carran
za's army. Funston has nearly fifty
thousand men. .
BROKE UP A BAND
Brownsville, June 17. United
States troops late last night engaged
a band of between fifteen and thirty
Mexican bandits about ten miles eas
of San Benito, Texas, and after ex
changing a few shots the Mexicans

were scattered, it is reported tnat
hree Mexicans were killed. So far
as known there were no American
casualties. Two companies of the
wenty-sixth Infantry were immedi
ately rushed from Harlingen, Texas,
to 01mito,.ten miles north of Browns
ville, in an effort to cut off the bandits
who were reported at midnight head
ed for the Rio Grande.
MEXICAN POLICY UNCHANGED
Washington, June 17. The warn
ing from Mexican commanders that
movements of American troops, ex
cept in retirement "toward the border,
will precipitate hostilities, won't
change the purpose of ' the United
States to keep the expedition under
General Pershing in Mexico, or pre
vent the American commander main
taining the safety of his column and
dealing with bandits. No further
southern advance is contemplated.
Direct word from Gen. Pershing is
awaited.
Colonel Bell told General Funston
over the telephone of the warning
given by Trevino, the Mexican com
mander. It is thought he obtained
this information from high Mexican
officials. Diplomatic officials here are
inclined to believe the warning was
"or home consumption and not a pre-
ude to hostilities. ,
Secretary Lansing, m a statement
given to the press this afternoon, said
he situation was unchanged. ; The
reply to Carranza's note is withheld
pending possible additions covering
the San Ignacio raid and Trevino's
reported ultimatum.
WHERE ARE THE
. NINETY AND NINE?
Reading the Star's article, the
other day, about street Arabs, swim
ming pools, etc., Dr. McClane, always
a friend of the boys, was deeply im
pressed. He says that he will be one
of a hundred men to contribute $10
each to build a swimming pool.
A thousand dollars would- build a
good pool, which would be a great
aid to the cleanliness and comfort of
hundreds. The one man who went
not astray is found; how shall we
round up the ninety and nine? 1
An earnest young clergyman and
some others who read the article are
interesting themselves in the subject.
We hope their work will grow and
bear fruit.

OCALA, FLORIDA, SATURDAY, JUNE 17, 1916
VATITS A MASS MEETING
OF PEOPLE I
A mass meeting for the purpose of
sounding further the sentiment of the
county with regard to the proposed
bond issue for permanent roads has
been suggested by W.-D. Cam, chair-
man oi the county commissioners.
The suggestion was made by Mr.
Cam yesterday . afternoon at the
meeting of the county Dixie Highway
council, when he was questioned about
the issue. Mr. Cam favors bonding,
and believes that the county favors
bonding, but before any action is tak
en by the commissioners he thinks
that the attitude of, the people should
be definitely understood. He will dur
ing the next few days consult with
some of the leading citizens of the
county with a view to determining
the best method of getting at the
sentiment. .
Mr. Cam told the members of the
Dixie Highway association that he
had figured that the county, by using
convict labor, and employing first
class engineers, could make perma
nent with sand-asphalt every existing
hard-surfaced road and in addition
the road from Silver Springs to Or
ange Springs and Putnam county,
providing a short route to Jackson
ville, and the road from Sharp's ferry
to Moss Bluff and Lake county, pro
viding a route to the East Coast. This
would provide every section of the
county with a permanent road, giving
every section the benefit of the bonds.
He points out that his suggestions
are subject to any changes that " the
people of the county think should be
made. With a $600,000 bond issue,
Mr. Cam figures that the Dixie High
way can be built 15 feet wide for its
full length through the county, and
the other roads nine feet wide, with
a width of 15 feet for a mile out of
Ocala and in the case of steep, grades
and sharp curves. :
The chairman of the commissioners
pointed out that at a recent meeting
at Fort McCoy, with about 25 or 30
citizens present, a unanimous vote
was cast in favor of bonds.. Fort Mc
Coy would get the benefit of the road
from Silver Springs to the Putnam
county line.
The. following roads are suggested
by Mr. Cam for permanent construc
tion: Ocala and Mcintosh road, Lowell
and Flemington, Ocala to Citra, Sil
ver Springs to Orange Springs and
Putnam county, Sharp's' ferry road
to Moss Bluff and Lake county, Ocala
to Lake Weir and Lake county, Belle
view to Summerfield and Sumter
county, Ocala to Pedro and Dallas,
Ocala to Dunnellon, Ocala to St. Johns
church, Ocala to Blitchton and the
Levy county line.

FEW BUT FAITHFUL
Five Good Roads Workers Attended
the Dixje Highway Council Meet
ing in Ocala Friday
Five men attended the meeting of
the Marion county Dixie Highway
council Friday afternoon in the Board
of Trade room, and of these five three
were members and one became a
member. It was necessary to have
the new memberin order to make a
quorum. It was the first annual meet
ing of the council, and all of the of
ficers were re-elected with the excep
tion of the vice-president. R. R. Car
roll was chosen to fill that office.
The officers for 1916-17 will be:
Louis H. Chazal, president; R. R.
Carroll, vice president; David S
Welch, secretary; W. V. Wheeler,
treasurer; J. J. Gerig, director. W.
D. Cam, chairman of the county com
missioners, became a member. Those
pres'ent at the meeting were: J. J.
Gerig, J. D. Rooney, who has a life
membership, David S. Welch, W. D.
Cam, W. A. Bennett and Louis H.
Chazal. It had been hoped that the
attendance would be large, and that
the membership would be consider
ably5 increased. There are at present
only seven members of tne highway
association in this county. It was de-x
cided that all of these members form
a committee on membership to. make
a strenuous effort to obtain more
backing for the Dixie Highway. A re
port; on the condition of the two
branches of the highway in this coun
ty will be made to the Central Florida
Highway association next week, in ac
cordance with the resolution adopted
by the latter organization at its last
meeting.
PENINSULA CLUB HAS PASSED
It Did Much Good Work During Its
, Brief but Pleasant Existence
Believing that better results would
be obtained if those members having
a desire to "boost" joined the Board
of Trade, and those caring, for the
social side joined the Commercial
Club, the Peninsula Club at a meet
ing at the Ocala House disbanded,
with the understanding that its mem
bers would become members of either
of the other two organizations.
W. T. Gary appeared before the
club and extended an invitation to
join the Commercial Club. Many
members of the .Feninsula Club are
already members of the Commercial
Club, and some are members of the
Board of Trade. It is probable that
many will join hoth bodies, to carry
out the original idea of the Peninsula
Club to combine the social and
"boosting" features.

AGREED AND ADJOURNED
President's Request Kept the Suff
rage Plank in the National
Democratic Platform
(Associated Press)
Coliseum, St. Louis, June 16, 3:45 p.
m. ihe democratic convention adopt
ed the party platform by acclamation
and adjourned sine die. t
SUFFRAGE PLANK STUCK J
St. Louis, June 17. After an un
successful fierht to throw out the
suffrage plank In the democratic
platform, as approved by President.
Wilson, the convention at 3:09 p. m.
adopted the whole platform, includ
ing planks on suffrage and Ameri
canism, by acclamation.
The fight on the suffrage plank,
the first row in the convention, was
led by Governor Ferguson, of Texas,
and seemed to have a chance of suc
cess until Senator Walsh, of Mon
tana, told the delegates that Presi
dent Wilson considered the suffrage
plank, as written, necessary to the.
success of the party. Roll call of the
states showed only 181 1-2 votes for
the Ferguson substitute against 888
1-2 for the original plank.
The adopted plank is as follows:
"We favor the extension of the fran
chise to the women of this country,
state by state, on the same terms as
the men." The fight on the plank
came in from minority reports sub
stituting a plank which would have
left the matter entirely to the states
without any expression of opinion fa
voring suffrage.
Governor Ferguson, in leading the
fight on the anti-suffragists, declar
ed that suffrage is purely a matter
of states rights and that the question
and wording of the majority plank
was "presumptious recommending to
states on how to conduct their elec
toral." Suffrage leaders considered the or
iginal plank much more favorable
than the declaration given them at
the republican convention and threw
their entire strength into thejight in
behalf of the administration leaders.
Senator Walsh's plea that President
Wilson had urged the plank and to
reject it would cause a discordant
note in the proceedings prevailed and
the minority report was defeated.
