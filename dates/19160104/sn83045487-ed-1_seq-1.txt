NATION COULD SAVE BY
EATING HORSE MEAT
Physicians Declare Equine' Steaks Are Healthful and
Appetizing $36,000;000 Would Be Saved
. on Meat Bill
r BY KENNETH W. PAYNE
' New York, Jan. 4. Ecce, the edi
ble equine! Or, to lapse from Latin,
Lo, the palatable pony! For horse
flesh as legitimate food for humans
is at last to be officially recognised
in America!
And the amazing reduction of at
least $36,000,000 annually in the na
tion's high cost of living would be
realized if all othey communities
would follow the lead of New York,
whose' hoard of health, beginning
Jan, 1, wil permit the sale of , horse
meat Chicago housewives woukl
gain $720,000 annually if they would
serve stallion steaks and colt cutlets;
Philadelphia $600,000.
.These figures are based on a re
cent horse census which shows that
the annual horse mortality in this
country must be close to 360,000.
Valueing each horse at $100 we get
the above huge total of annual cash
wastage in American horseflesh. And
it must be remembered that in part
this mortality is due to the hard labor
demanded of the animal. If, instead
of being worked to death he were
carefully bred for his food value, at
his death he would be an asset in
stead of afloss. s '
