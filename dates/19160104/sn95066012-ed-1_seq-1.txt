Slav and L Battle for Favor
. oti. -Ma ,
RUSSIANS WANT CZARNOWITZ
Through Possession of Bokowina's
" Capital They Would Hoid' "Key
to the Carpathians."
Loudon, Jan. 3 The Galiciun irovvn
land, Bukowina, the province of Vol
hynla and the western part of Bes
sarabia constitute the battle ground
of two huge armies, Russian aud Aus-tro-Gernian,
which began nearly a
week ago and is still in full swing,
with the Russians the attackers and
Rumania's eventful aid the prize cov
eted by botli sides.
In Bukowina the battle centers up
on Czernowitz the capital. Hero the
Russians yesterday stormed a height
and apparently are making slow but
steady headway. In Volhynia a five
day battle continues on the Styr and
on the Bug northward of Czartorysk,
north of Rnfalowka. ami to the Pripet
marshes.
Czartorysk on the Kovel-Sarny sec
tor, has been bitterly contested for
months but never since the (laliclan
battle in the earlier stages of the war
has the fighting tor this point been so
bitter and so protracted as it is In this
still undecided struggle.
Only by wrestling from the Teutons
the two Vulhynian fortresses, Hubno
and Lutsk, will the Russians be able
to undertake a new campaign against
eastern Gallcia on a large scale, Rov-
no, the third stronghold, Is in their
hands. ;
The Russian offensive in Volhynia,
.therefore, is aimed at gaining the en
tire Kovel Sarny section of the Brest-
Litovsk-Kleff railway, thus cutting
off the essential Teuton supply line
and then driving southward in a flank
ing movement, against Lutsk and Dub
uo. ..
On the other hand, the -Anstro-Ger-
man forces by decisively lefeati)ig the
Russians in this region, would gain
the road to Rovno and possession of
that fortress would strengthen their
position, tremendously.
On the east. Galician front which
with the Bessarablan sector stretches
close to t ho .Rumanian border, the bat
tle rages chiefly southward of Pamo
pel on the middle and upper Strypa,
the bridge head of Burkanow and be
yond Wisnlowfeyk to Buczae. Here
the Russians are endeavoring to make
headway toward Lemburg to capture
that city. Czernowitz Is considered
by military experts as the "key to the
Carpathians." Its capture by the Rus
sians would compel the Teutons to
abandon their positions near the Ru
manian frontier.

WHAT IS THE GRIP?
Present Visitation of the . Disease
Serious in Some Localities
If you have cold in the head, in
liamation of the muculous membrane
of tho throat, nose and respiratory
tubes, shooting pains in the head and
back and a peculiarly cramped feeling
in the joints; if you have a high fever
and an equally bad temper, its a sure
bet you've got the grip. It is equally
as certain that you are not alone iu
your affliction. There are lots of oth
ers in Bennington; in fact the entire
country is Buffering with it, or has
suffered with it within the past
month, and chances are that there
will be many other cases. According
to Dr. William Osier, the noted medi
cal authority, the grip is a "pandemic
disease appearing at irregular inter
vals, characterized by extraordinary
rup!dlty of extension and the large
number of people attacked."
The last months of 1914 saw the be
ginning of the present pandemic and
it hat spread with such rapidity in
America that almost every communi
ty has suffered with it. Few indeed
have escaped its affliction. The dis
ease, first came into prominent notice
peveral weeks ago in Chicago, and
then reports from Pitts-burg, Harris
burg and Philadelphia, Pa., showed
people sulferlng acutely from it there.
New York next came in for an epi
demic and now it has invaded Now
Kuglaud.
Dr. Osier has written an elaborate
work on this form of influenza. Noth
ing apparently was heard of it, or at
least It was not distinguished as a
special disease, until the ICth cen
tury. It lay rather dormant for sev
eral hundred years, but reappeared
In the shape of four serious
pandemics in the Ifllh century. The
first came In 18.3:1, the second in 18:50
1837, the third in 1S47-1848 and the
fourth in 1SS! and 18!0. Since the
pandemic of 1800 there has been still
another, tho pandemic of 103, which
is still remembered with none too
pleasant memories.
Probably the most noted of these
was the one commonly referred to as
the pandemic of 18H0, which is still
remebered. This pandemic is sup
posed to have started In Buchard In
May 1SS!). U was reported as an
epidemic in Moscow In September, in
St. Petersburg (Petrograd) in Octo
ber. It reached I"erlin In November
and was in Umdon ip December.
Within 10 or 14 days it reached New
York. As. Dr. Osier characterized it,
U W..l'hlgbly coJitBtfieii ju4. spread
with remarkable rapidity." This
characterization is equally true of
the present epedemic, which... has U
the appearance of a pandemic. The
mortality resulting from the grip was
estimated as one-tenth of 1 per cent;
in the German army in ISiio. In the
civilian population It is higher, how
ever, and flirured one-half of 1 per
cent, one-half of which was caused by
pneumonia resulting from It.
. Pfeiffer, the noted bacteriologist,
discovered in 1802 that the true epe
demlc Influenza or grip was caused by
a definite bacillus. Since then oilier
noted discoveries have been made in
connection with the disease. There
seems to be no definite means of es
caping it. although there are people
who appear to bo entirely immune
from the disease. People seem to be
the common carriers of the disease
germ, and possibly the only precau
tion that: can be taken is the Isolation
or quarantine for the a filleted per
fon. This is especially true of per
sons in a household, where it is pos
sible to take such steps.
According to prominent physicians
and bateriologists, the idea of educat
ing the public is excellent, especially
in a disease like grip. Medical
science, however, has not. yet found
out any special means for driving out
the germ and the person once afllict-
ed with it must run the gaumut ot the
disease, being careful not. to foster
conditions that-aggravate it.
The common conception of the grip,
says the New York Times, is usually
connected with a cold in the head and
inflammation of the mucous mem
brane of the nose and thront. This,
however, is but one form of the dis
casfi. There arc four to lie reckoned
with, The first is the most common,
the respiratory. This, as stated be
fore, attacks the membranes of the
nose and throat, and respiratory
tubes, and has tho same pymptons of
the ordinary cold for which it is of
ten mistaken. This form, if neglected
very often develops into the more se
rious disease called bronchitis.
Another form affects the .nerves.
This shows its pretence by severe
shooting pains iu the nerve centers,
that Is, the head and back, together
with a cramped feeling in the joints.
These symptons are too often allowed
to paBS, and in many cases lead to
certain forms of nervous disease, for
which tho patient cannot apparently
account.
The third specter in this array is
known as the febrile from. The
name explains itself, the diseaso be-
ing accompanied by u high degree of
fever very much like that of typhoid.
A good many pneumonia cates result
from a lack of attention to the symp
tons that characterize, this form.

Tile prayer meeting of the Metho

instead of Thursday evening on ' ac
count of the Sunday School Institute
which will then be in session. At the
service this evening the pastor, K. T.

they attended In Albany yesterday.
At the close of the service a meeting
of the Kp worth League will be held
to elect olllcers tor the ensuing six
months. Will all members of the
League please plan to be present.
Then comes ll.e last and happily
the least :up:ila:- of this family, the
gastroint.cK'.ln ii form. This is seldom
recognized by tho layman as having
anything at all common with what he
considers the grip. It is heralded by
pains in the abdomen, nausea and all
the other symptons usually connected
with intestinal trouble. Fortunately
this form, by virtue of the character
of its symptons, is not oftcu neglect
ed and therefore counts only a com
paratively few people among its suf
ferers. RAW FURS

Thieves Also Appropriated Quantity
of Heavy Clothing, Sweaters and

Goods valued at about $2oO were
removed from the general store of O.
O. Ware in YVilmingtcn Sunday night
when burglars gained an entrance to
the store and carried off a large
amount of clothing and jewelry.
An entrance was gained from a
rear window where a pane of glass
wa-j cut out with a diamond and the
co tch turned. Once inside the store
a crowbar pried open the door from
the store-room into the main store
and the thieves helped themselves to
some queer loot.
Four heavy woolen sweaters were
taken, several suits of underwear, a
dozen pairs of trousers and the jewel
ry caso filled with gold and silver
watches valued from $8 to $18 each.
The jewelry ease was rifled of its en
tire contents with the exception of
one timepiece of no value. All the
geld rings were also removed. The
thieves failed to secure much money,
about two dollars being taken from
the cash drawer which had been left
to make change the following morn
ing.
The burglary was discovered by Mr.
Ware when he opened the store early
Monday morning. He at once noti
fied the authorities who went through
the trains leaving Wilmington Mon
day, examining the baggago of sus
picious characters but no clue to the
perpeuators has yet been discovered.
This is the second burglary on the
Ware property within a year thieves
entering tho store, last spring and sim
