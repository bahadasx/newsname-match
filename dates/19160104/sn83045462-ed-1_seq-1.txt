for Encouragement by
Chester Lloyd Jones.
Sectional meetings of the PanAmerican
Scientific Congress continned
today in various Washington
hotels and other auditoriums,
with a prospect that
w ithin a day or two most of the
sections will have completed
their labors and be ready to adjourn.
Section I. devoted to anthropolgy.
which has been meeting
at the New National Museum,
was the first to end its work, and j
adjourned today.
The delegates continued to
present important papers, mostly 1
of a scientific character. One of
the most important studies presented
which was not of a purely
scientific character furnished considerable
enlightenment as to the
extraordinary efforts which have
been made "by South American
countries to maintain their public
credit, especially their foreign
debt obligations, which were
menace*! by the war in Europe.
This study was contributed by [
' t.'hcster Lloyd Jones of the Uni- 1
\ rrsity of Wisconsin, who spoke
fii the effects of the war on Latin
American public finances before ;
section IX of the congress. J

Financial Crisis Passed.
Mr Jones said that retrenchments in
expenditures, increased taxation and
public loans have enabled the South
American countries to pass the financial
crisis, and that business in those
countries is becoming normal.
In some commercial countries." said
Mr. Jones, "the war has had .less effect.
Bolivia is weathering the storm
satisfactorily. Paraguay, a prey to
.evolutions and depreciated currency,
is. independently of the war. in hard
financial straits. Peru. Colombia and
Venezuela are doing well, not because
of their own financial strength, but because
the character of their foreign
trade is such that their markets have
been only slightly affected. Ecuador is
i he least affected.
' .Mexico and Haiti have been little afic
ted because exhausted by revolutions
at home. San Domingo is enjoying
good trade, In spite of the disarrangement
of her European < market.
C uba expects the greatest sugar crop
in history, and Central American trade
ionoitions have almost returned to normal.
The performance of the Latin
American states under financial strain '
of war conditions is reason for encouragement."
Dollar as Monetary Unit.
The American gold dollar as the unit
of a new monetary system for South
arid Central America was suggested by
I>r. S. N. D. North, assistant secretary
for the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace. He declared the
American dollar to be the Ideal morelary
unit for the world. He said it j
could be adopted by the Latin American
countries with very little disturbonce
of their present systems.
He deplored tlu? fact that the United
Btatee bad not adopted the decimal
ystem for her money as has been done
In the countries to the south.

"A rapid transformation fs going forward,

decades have witnessed rapidly increasing

rubber, fibers and woods, but also for
food products, notably bananas and

CABINET RESIGNATION
FORMALLY ANNOUNCED
Sir John Simon Refuses Entreaties
to Remain?Welsh Miners
Threaten Trouble.
"LOXDOX. January 4.?Lord Derby's
recruiting figures for the period between
October 23 and December 15
show that 1,150,000 unmarried men and
1,679,263 married men presented themselves
for service.
Of the grand total of 2,829,263 married
and single men 103,000 unmarried
and 112,431 married men enlisted immediately.
Eight hundred and forty
thousand single men and 1,344,979 married
men were attested for future service.
Of the. single men 207,000 were rejected.
while 221,853 married men were
not accepted by the recruiting officers.
Resignation Announced.
Announcement was made in the house
of commons today of the resignation of
Sir John Simon, secretary of state for
home affairs.
The South Wales miners appear to be
dead against conscription. James Winstone.
president of the South Wales
Miners* Federation, in a speech at
Pontypool yesterday, announced that
the executive committee had passed
a resolution unanimously protesting
against conscription.
"I know what I am saving," he added.
"Unless the politicians of this
country are careful they will stop the
South Wales coal fields and there will
be no coal for the navy."
Completes Draft of Bill.
Before the house of commons reassembled
today the cabinet was scheduled
to meet to put the finishing
touches on the draft of the compulsion
bill which will be introduced the following
day. Thus far there has been
no official statement as to the scope
of the bill, and the greatest interest is t
manifested by the general public as to
the attitude the measure will take
toward Ireland.
The Press Association, which declared
that Ireland would be included in the
operation of the act, estimates that the
number of members of the house who
will vote against the bill will not exceed
forty.
Befuses to Stay in Cabinet.
It again becomes evident that the
cabinet crisis is far from ended. The
only definite point is that Sir John Simon,
secretary of state for home affairs,
has resigned. He had a prolonged
interview with Premier Asluith
yesterday.
The premier did his utmost to induce
Sir John to remain in the cabinet, but
without .avail and it is almost .certain
hat the home secretary's resignation
will be officially announced on the reLssembling
of parliament.
The position of Reginald McKenna,
chancellor of the exchequer, and Walter
Runciman. president of the board
of trade, is still undecided. They are
making the acceptance of the government
compulsion bill conditional upon
securing a concession to their views
>n the eventual size of the army.
In this matter Premier Asquith is in
in embarrassing: position. He is being
strongly impelled from the outside not
lo yield this point and it is believed
that a majority in the cabinet itself is
igainst their views.
HEARINGS ON O.C. BILL
WILL BEGIN TOMORROW
Invitations to Commissioners to Be
the First to Appear Are
Issued.
First hearings on the District appropriation
bill will be held tomorrow, according
to an announcement by Chairman
Page of the subcommittee of the
House appropriations committee in
charge of the bill. Invitations to the
Commissioners to be present at the
opening hearing have been sent out
and other officials who expect to explain
items in the bill will receive
notices for their appearance as the
hearings progress.
It is expected that the bill will not
be reported from the full committee in
a hurry, but that plenty of time will
be given to receive and digest the report
of the joint committee on the
fiscal relations between the United
States and the District of Columbia.
The subcommittee has a large task
*?n its hands, as the estimates for the
District bill this year total $15,473.676.34,
including: the water department,
and $15,343,196.34 exclusive of that department.
The amount payable front
the revenues of the District is $7,701,706.17
and from the United States $7,641,468.17.
FISCAL RELATIONS REPORT
IS NOT YET COMPLETED j
Joint Select Committee to Meet
Again Tomorrow Night?Conclusions
Withheld.
The joint select committee on the fiscal
relations between the United States
and the District of Columbia today
made another attempt to set together
on its report to Congress, but failed
to complete its work. The committee
will meet tomorrow night at the home
of Senator Saulsbury, and it is the hope
of the committeemen that they will be
able to submit their report to Congress
Thursday. The time in which the committee
must report expires next Monday.
The members of the committee are
still closely guarding the result of their
labors. It was said, however, after the
meeting today, that no report had yet
been agreed upon and that some differences
of opinion had arisen among
the members of the committee that
must be smoothed out if possible.
ANTI-SPITTING LAW
WILL BE ENFORCED
Maj. Pullman Issues Warning
That Violation of Regulation
Will Mean Arrest.
HELD POSSIBLE FACTOR
IN HIGHER DEATH RATE
Diphtheria and Tuberculosis Among
Diseases It Spreads, Health De
puruneni roinis uui.
Searching for an explanation of the
extensive increase in Washington's
death rate last year, health department
officials today prepared to direct
attention to the danger of the spread
of diseases through disregard of the
law prohibiting spitting in street cars
and other publjp places.
It is known that this careless and
filthy habit is a direct conveyor of
many fatal diseases, among them tuberculosis
and diphtheria, both of
which recorded increases dilring the
year Just closed.
While Health Officer Woodward
frankly admits that the cause for the
increase in the death rate remains to
be discovered, the spitting danger is
one that is regarded as a possible
factor in the situation, and the health
department intends to do all within
its power to minimize it during the
present year.
Present Regulation Sufficient.
The present regulation on this subject
is regarded as sufficient, provided it is
effectively enforced. While spitting on
sidewalks is prohibited, the department
regards as much more dangerous the
carelessness of some persons in spitting
in street cars and other inclosed
places, where the germs do not come|
into contact with fresh air, and, therefore,
are much more likely to thrive.
The results of an active anti-spitting
crusade will be noted carefully by the |
department, and it is expected that
more widespread enforcement of the
regulation will make its effect felt in I
a reduced number of tuberculosis cases. I
While enforcement of the regulation I
is in the hands of the police department,
the health officials will endeavor,
through printed circulars and in other
ways, to make Washington freer from
this dangerous habit than it has ever
been.
To Be Strictly Enforced.
Maj. Pullman, superintendent of
police, today issued a warning that the
anti-spitting law is to be strictly enforced,
beginning in a few days. He
believes that education of the people
as-'to the regulation against expectorating
on the sidewalks, in street cars
and public places generally should
precede Wholesale arrests.
"But,"* he added, "you can say that
the regulation will be strictly enforced
and members of the.department will
be so advised."
, Maj. Pullman thinks it bad enough
for people to expectorate in the street,
but when they use the sidewalks it becomes
a serious matter, which should
and will be stopped.
"1 am only too glad to co-operate i
with the Anti-Tuberculosis Society or
any other organization in the enforcement
of laws that are framed with a
view to protecting health," the superintendent
said.
Maj. Pullman said the police departments
all over the country are working
to get the masses acquainted with the
regulations and laws governing the
different communities, believing that
educating them and getting them to favor
the spirit of the laws accomplishes
much good. The tendency, he stated, is
to educate mem so iiim. n win oecume
unnecessary to make so many arrests
for minor offenses.
No Excuse for the Habit.
"Expectorating on sidewalks and in
other public places." said Maj. Pullman.
"is a filthy habit, for wljjch there
absolutely is no excuse."
When the regulation was enacted several
years ago Maj. Sylvester, who was
chief of police at that time, waged a
campaign of education by having members
of the force hand spitters a card
warning them to heed the law. The
card read:
Please Take Notice!
Police Regulation.
To spit on any paved sidewalk or footpath
:
Or to spit on any street railway car or
othervpublic vehicle;
Or to spit on any part of any public
building under the control of the?
Commissioners of the District of
Columbia
Is Unlawful.
Several thousand copies of the cards
were distributed by the police, and
since that time an_ occasional arrest
has been made. Now Maj. Pullman
will adopt some means of conducting a
campaign of education before directing
his men to make wholesale arrests.
The regulation against spreading disease-provides
that no person shall expectorate
or spit in or upon any part of
any street railway car, or other public
vehicle carrying passengers for hire.
or in or upon any part of any public
building under the control of the Commissioners
of the District of Columbia,
or in or upon any parking, footpath or
sidewalk in the#District of Columbia.
Fine of $1 to $40 Provided.
It is further provided that street railway
companies and the proprietors of
other public vehicles carrying passengers
for hire shall keep posted conspicuously*
in each and every one of
their cars and public vehicles notices
forbidding such expectorating or spitting.
The punishment is a fine of from
$1 to $40.
In most of the cases made for violations
of the provisions or the regulation,
It is stated, the defendants were
required to deposit $1 collateral, and
such, it Is stated, was the amount of
fine imposed in cases taken before the
judges of the Police Court. Following
a crusade that the pplice department
soon will Inaugurate, it is stated, the
infliction of heayier penalties may be
asked. c

CREWOF THESSALONIKn
WISH TO ABANDON SHIP
Greek Liner Has Been at Mercy of
Galei and- Seas for Ten
Days.
XEW YORK, January 4.?Members of
the crew of the Greek line steamship
Thessaloniki wish to abandon the ship,
which has been at the mercy of gales
and high .seas for ten days, according
to a radio message received here today
from the steamship United States,
which has gone to the aid of the disabled
vessel, j
The Thessaloniki. which has been a
helpless owing to the partial flooding t
of her boiler and engine rooms, sent a
iv me oicauiniui) i-llllCU CIUICS
saying that ninety of the crew remained
on the Greek steamer, but that all t
passengers had been safely transferred '
to the steamship Patris of the same
line.
The Thcssaloniki has been disabled
virtually adrift for about ten clays. It j
was first reported that her engine ,
rooms were .flooded. Yesterday word
came that her 300 passengers had been (
transferred to the Patris, which then <
took the crippled steamer in tow. ,
Steamers "Standing By." 1
The first message telling of the ^
breaking of the to\y line was received .
at 2:15 o'clock this morning, it gave ^
her position and said that the steamer <
had no means of aiding herself. Distress
signals had been sent out, the 4
message stated, and the steamers Fin- 1
land and Stockholm were reported to I
be "standing by."
Soon afterward a message sent by ?
the captain of the Thessaloniki to the
Stockholm was overheard by wireless
stations on shore. The captain asked
the Stockholm to come to his aid and
to tow the Thessaloniki to New York.
Steamers Go to Vessel's Aid.
A radio message received here early
today from the* Scandinavian line
steamship United States said that
steamer bad turned from her course
and headed toward the Thessaloniki.
The captain said he would confine his
efforts to aiding the passengers and
crew of the disabled Greek steamer, as
the prevailing northwest gale would
make it impossible to tow the Thessaloniki.
A later message today from the
steamer Stockholm said this vessel was
nearing the position given by the
Thessaloniki in her S. O. S. call at 2:15
a.m.
Northwest Gale Has Abated.
A radio message from the captain of
the steamer United States at 9:44 a.m.
said his vessel then' was seventy-seven
miles from the Thessaloniki and was
proceeding at fifteen knots an hour.
The northwest gale which raged all
night had entirely abated.
Transfer Again Reported.
The Greek line received a message today
from Capt. Zagoras of the Patris
saying that tide Thessaloniki's passert!
gers had been transferred to the Patris
| last night. Officials of tlue line were
J surprised at this message in view of
the fact that Friday last a wireless
was received from the Patris saying
that she had taken on board the 300
passengers on the Thessaloniki.

Secretary McAdoo Would Take Steps
to Check Typhoid Fever
and Pellagra.
Secretary McAdoo asked Congress to- ^
'.day for a rush appropriation of $100,1
000 for "studies and demonstration
work" in rural sanitation, including:
1 food and water supply throughout the
country, with a particular view to
checking typhoid fever and epllagra.
Asking that the amount be made immediately
available, so that the first
six months of 1916 might be used in
preventing illness, Secretary McAdoo
submitted a report from the public
health service, saying its investigations
since July 1, 1914, indicated the
urgent-need of extension of these health
activities, that the country population
of the United States has not kept pace
with urban communities along sanitation
lines, and that improper food has
ueen ssnown 10 nave a "proiounu influence
on health of populations and to
be directly responsible for the increasing
prevalence of pellagra.
"Increased demonstrations," the report
said, "are urgently required to
prevent pellagra from becoming a veritable
scourge in many rural communities."
In Mississippi alone there were
10.954 cases and 1,024 deaths from pellagra
last year, and in certain other
states it has exceeded tuberculosis as
a cause of death. It is estimated that
there have been approximately 75,000
cases of pellagra throughout the country
this past year, with more than 7,500
deaths." ,

AMERICAN'S STORT
OF PERSIA'S LOSS
Charles Grant of Boston Tells
of Harrowing Experience
in Mediterranean.
FIRST WARNED OF PERIL
BY TERRIFIC EXPLOSION
Robert MeNeely, American Consul,
Not Known to Be Among
the Survivors.
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt. January 4. via
I^ondon, 10:30 a.m.?Charles Grant of
Boston, one of the two Americans
known to have been on board the British
steamship Persia when she was torpedoed
in the Mediterranean last
Thursday, lias arrived in Alexandria.
Mr. Grant, so far as is known, is the
only American from whom can come j
the story of the Persia's sinking:. He
gave to the Associated Press today the
most detailed account yet received of
the disaster.
"I was in the dining saloon of the
Persia at 1:05 p.m.." he said. "I had
just finished my soup, and the steward
was asking what I would take for my
second course, when a terrific explosion
occurred.
No Panic on Board.
"The saloon became filled with smoke,
broken glass and steam from the boiler,
which appeared to have burst. There
was no panic on board. We went on
deck, as though we were at drill, and
reported at the lifeboats on the starboard
side, as the vessel had listed to
port. I clung to the railing.
"The last thing done was to tie on
Capt. Sprickly's life belt.
"As the vessel was then listing so
badly that It was impossible to launch
the starboard boats. I slid down the
starboard rail into the wp.ter. I got
caught in a rope, which pulled off a
shoe, but I broke loose and climbed on
some floating wreckage, to which I
clung. :
"The last I saw of the Persia she
had her bow in the air, -five minutes 1
after the explosion.
In Water Many Hours.
"After floating about on the wreckage'
until 4 o'clock in the morning I
saw five boats. I was pulletf into one
of them. We rowed about looking for
other stragglers.
"The boats became overloaded and ^
'the occupants were redistributed. Four
boats were tied together by their paint- 1
ers and the fifth followed some distance
away.
"My boat left the others in order to 1
search the more frequented steamship j
channels for help. We rowed for three
hours. Then we saw a cruiser and j 1
called out: "We are English.' We explained
that we were survivors of the 1
Persia and gave directions to the 1 j
cruiser as to where the other boats j
were. They were soon found and the J
occupants were taken off immediately :
by the English sailors. j
"Robert McXe.elv. American consul at
Aden, sat at the same table with me on
the voyage. He was not seen, probably
because his cabin was on the port (
side. >
"It was a horrible scene. The water
was black as ink. Some passengers
were screaming, others were calling
'out good bye. Those in one boat sang 5
hymns." ^
More Survivors Landed. ,
LONDON*. January 4.?The Peninsular
and Oriental Steamship Compaity lias 1
received a dispatch from Malta, saying f
that eleven more survivors of tlv; (
steamer Persia have been landed, in- *
eluding Lord Montagu. Robert M. Mc- t
Neelv, the American consul at Aden,
was not among the survivors landed at *
Malta. The Peninsular and Oriental
Company says the survivors consist of
three English, one Italian and seven
Lascars.
The managers of the company say tl
they have authorized no statement regarding
a gun on board the steamer
Persia. Th/?re is, however, no reason
to doubt that the vessel carried one A
4.7-inch gun astern for defensive pur- d
poses. tl
