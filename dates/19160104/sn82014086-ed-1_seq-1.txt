' Talk of, Martial Law in Greece. .
' The report of the declaration of mar
tial law in Greece, to be put Into ef
fect in Greece next week has caused
renewed speculation in . the capitals
of the world. It may very probably
be explained on the ground of the
threatened Bulgar-Teutonie invasion
of Greek territory in the effort to drive
the allies out of Salonlca. No hint, it
will be seen, is given of the action to
be undertaken by the Greek govern
ment- under these circumstances. - In
view of his course up to the present
time it might be expected that King
Constantine. under military law, would
crush out subjects very largely, in
sympathy with the allies against the
invaders, - particularly - the Bulgarians,
for. whom the Greek people cherish a
deep-seated hatred, the legacy of the
second Balkan war. - v . : . , -.

BIG MIDNIGHT FIRE
Hotel' . Connecticut Destroyed Two
Men Killed, Five Injured Sixty
Guests Were Endangered. -
Waterbury, Conn., Jan. 4. :Two men
were killed, five others injured and
the lives of sixty guests endangered
in a fire that destroyed the Hotel Con

section arly today. One of the dead
men is George Cass, aged 60, a hotel
employe, who was overcome with

police say they believe all the guests
escaped from the building.
Members of a burlesque company
had retired in the hotel shortly before
the fire broke out. Vincent Dusey of
New York, their manager, said that
hardly any of the company escaped
with more than their night clothes and
such street- clothes as they could
snatch hastily as they fled from the
building. Manager James Clancy " of
a local theater led his wife and child
to safety and the firemen carried his
aged mother down the fire escape. The
firemen did heroic work in saving the
women and they had hardly completed
their search of the building when they
were forced to flee for their lives from
the flames that burst up through the
.three floors and forced their way
through the roof.
At 2 oclock the man who died was
Identified as Charles M. Decker, of
South Norwalk, member of Lodge 97,
Odd Fellows. He was overcome by
smoke, apparently when trying to es
cape and was found at the front of
the building on the second floor sev
eral minutes after all were believed
to have been rescued. He was rush
ed to the hospital but died on his way.

To Provide Against the
Upon the Monroe Doctrine
FUNDAMENTAL BASIS
Navy General Board Believes Ten Years Must Elapse Befcra
. '- Any of the Belligerents Will Sufficiently Recover From
the Present War to Show Aggression- Declares Tint
by That Time the United States Navy Should Equal Any
Afloat Strategists Recommend an Army of Such Pro-
portions That a Portion of It Could be Used in Any
Southern Country Against a Foreign Invader Without
mnairing the Safety of the United States Itself. ;
Washington, Jan. 3. Possibility of
a combined attack by tow foreign
powers to break down the new Pan
American docerine evolved from main
tenance by the United States and ac
ceptance by South and Central Amer
ican republics of the Monroe Doctrine
is one of the fundamental basis for
the national defense plans formulated
by the army and navy strategists.
They believe it essential in the form
ulation of a national military policy.
It was learned tonight, to provide
against the eventuality of an assault
upon the doctrine by either an Asia
tic or a European power or even by
an alliance of two such powers, which
might hurl forces simultaneously at
the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. .
A navy equal In strength to those
of any two world powers, except
Great Britain and an army prepared
to fight for the intergrlty of the Pan
American idea anywhere in Pan
America is the ultimate aim of the
plans of the military experts.
Shock of Present War Will Last Ten
' Years.
Ten years is the time the navy
general board believes the - United
States -has in which to prepare for a
readjustment of world forces which
will follow the European war. In
setting 1925 as . the time when the
United States navy should equal
cfloat which means - reaching the
two-power standard of the British
navy the board estimated that much
time would elapse before, the shock
of . the present war passed sufficiently
to -permit any-o. the- belligerents to
look to South or Central America for
colonial development or trade aggres
sion, t
Plans of" the army, 'war sT college
would - be consummated in six years.
The army officers take the position
that the United States must have suf
ficient troops arid troop ships to land
forces in any threatened Pin -American
country to meet an invader.
Mors Than Passive Resistance.
All these preparations, it is now
known, hare been presented by
strategists . to the administration ' as
essential to support the Monroe Doc
trine so that the United States may
be able to act alone, , if necessary, to
preserve Its Ideal of no entangling al
liances. Such ideals, the military
students have stated, Impose new
duties on the United States duties
that require something more than a
policy of mere passive resistance.
' - Pan-American Unity.
! While the administration branch ot
the government has submitted to
congress a definite plan which con
templates an increased expenditure of
more than a billion dollars on the mil
itary and naval establishments in the
next six years, all other agencies of
the government are acting to unify
and harmonize the Pan-American na
tions. To students of diplomacy, the
Pan-American declarations of Presi
dent Wilson in his opening address to
congress: the declarations for Pan
American unity made to the Pan
American Scientific Congress here by
Secretary Lansing and the general ef
fort for unity of all the Americas on
a basis of friendship and equality,
take on added significance when con
sidered in connection with the - ad
ministration's preparedness plan.
Significant Factors.-
The recent announcement that the
ambasadors from Argentina, - Brazil
and Chili had been selected by the
United States to represent it on the
commission provided by the peace in
vestigation treaties with France,
Great Britain, and Italy, is regarded as
one of the significant factors in this
connection.
Significance also is seen In the dis
closure that an effort to postpone the
Pan-American Congress on the ground
that sufficient time had not been given
to prepare an adequate scientific pro
gramme was met by the statement
that the United States was insistently
desirous of taking prompt steps to
further the spirit of Pan-American
accord", confidence, sympathy and mu
tuality. South American capitals
uniformly report that the congress is
regarded there as more 'political than
scientific and that congress is regard
ed there as- more political than scien
tific and that apropriatlon of the sen
timent of Pan-American unity , Is
freely expressed.- .-
Confidential Information Not Revealed
What confidential information Y the
Army war college and the Navy gen
era Iboard .may have gathered con
cerning the Intentions . of any certain
powere , or powers - Is not being re

roe Doctrine .was based. . . y. ,
- A Two-Power .Navy. -"
With the military programme agreed
upon and defined, the boards of strat
egists were asked what, in their
opinion, would constitute adequate na
tional defense.' Their answer was to
build a two-power navy and organ
ise a federal army of sufficient size so
that. a portion of It could be used in
any southern country against a for
eign invader - without impairing the
safety of ,tht United States lnself.

mored last week in the capitol that
it was the "intention of Labor Com
missioner William S.- Hyde to rrn :e
changes in his subordinates, to go Into
effect Jan. 1st. At his office today ia
reply to a question he said:
"There will - be - so bum ed late
change." '
"Do you contemplate making any
changes in the future T" !
There will certainly be no changes,
for a couple of months, and you may';
depend on It, there will be none that;
will impair the efficiency of the depart
ment." - - - j
Commissioner Hyde said that reports '
made to him by his deputy factory in-j
spectors showed the manufacturing -business
of the state in excellent con-1
dition. Factories where war muni- i
tions were made were very busy. Butj
they were not the only ones where the
help- had steady employment. Other
factories in no way dependent on war.
supplies for business were busy, too.1

ness was sharing the general pros
