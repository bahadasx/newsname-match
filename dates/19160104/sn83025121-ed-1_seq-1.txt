a - ing til their calculation on the
, awumption that the Panama
canal moat b defended from the at
tacka of two allied powera, .acting in
consort,- the naval and military ex
pert! here are' working on plana for the
f roteetlou of the sone. The most ex
tensive fortification are being provid
ed for,-' fortification that meet with
the requirement of modern warfare ac
cording to the IcMona learned from, the
tremendous conflict In Europe.',
The idea is to have the tone o
thoroughly protected that any force
which two ordinary lowers could throw
against the ea-al would be beaten off
by the defenders. '
' The plana as outlined by the' army
etperte for that branch of the service,
provide for a garrison that will be able
and ready to protect any point of the
canal which might be attacked, ' and
the svttvin of fortification proposed
cover every vulnerable point along the
whole jphutb of the big waterway. '
The naval men are also l
Irawina np
plans in connection with thoir branch,
. ,for subniiwita to congress at th,e cur
rent, crnxion. Theie plans call for a
naval force-at,' Panama equal to anyi
that could be' launched by any two
powers exeept England. ' ' :',-r .' . '
The pmns are being worked out on
the' theory that the war in Europe- is
f oing to prevent any of the fighting
'owera from attempting to increase
. their territory for at least ten years,
. the time given by the experts before
the belligerents could repair the .dam
age done by this conflict and prepare
for another. They therefore are map
. ping out s building program which will
take several years to complete..1
, Back of all the plan, however, it
.. Is said, He the ideal of Pan-Amerl-
eanhim of America for American
: and thie rather than jthe mere, policy of
resistance Or defense is actuating the
experts in their work.
Administration Friendly . . , -
Just what' will be doeided npon hy
- congress remains to be seen, of course,
but the fact that the. general naval
board has recommended the expendi
ture of 300,000,OiK) oo a ship buUd
ing program which shall be completed
in 1921, and that tho war college bi
. suggested the spending- of $500,100,000
on preparedness measures, and that
.these ' measures hare the theoretical
support of both Secretary Daniel ami
Herretary. Uarrioon, is -taken were to
indicate that despite opposition the
genera pun wm go, through coin
' . houses. ' - . "' rt .
The two secretaries, Daniels and flar-
i rUon, while admitting the force of the
. arguments nsed by the naval and mill
. tary experts, have adopted the attitude
, . that because of the tremendous ex
pense involved, the plan as outlined by
President Wilson, and known as the
President's plan is the best to be Xol

MaJ.-Gen. Orenville ntellen Do.luo,
whose brilliant exploits during the Civil
War made him famous, died at his home
here yesterday. lie was eighty-flve
years old.
Two notable se. ricrs to his country
sssure General Dodge a place among the
history makers of the Civil War snd re
construction periods.
As s soldier his valor is attested by
the fsct thst four horses were shot
from undor him in the bsttle of Pea
Ridge, and that he. himself received
wounds in several battles.
As a pioneer in westers railroad build
ing he has the Union Pacific Railroad,
whose line he located and whose con
struction he superintended, standing to
day as a monument to his memory.
Home sixty. yeats sso. the then young
IHxIge, who had moved from New Eng
land, where be had studied civil en
gineering, to Council Bluffs, entered the
employ of the Uhnois Central Railroad
Araham Lincoln, who had done. legal
work for the same company, met the
young Yankee. 2 They talked of build
tug a railroad ever the Rocky Moun-'
tains and beyond, ' The world bad been
laughing at the project.. 'Lincoln and
Dodge agreed that it was feasible.

In- the ' midst of the undertaking I -
Hvu war broke-out. Dodge, born at
Danvcrs, MasHaehusetts, In 1&J1 wn just
thirty years old. Ho had had some mil
itary training at Norwich University, in
Vermont, and some experience fighting
Indians. Securing a colonel's commis
sion from his old friend, President Lin
coln, he raised, drilled snd equipped at
his own expense the Fourth Iowa Infan
try Regiment. - ' - ,.
Within two weeks colonel Dodge was

One fourth of his entire command, but
he saved the day for the Federal army
He again distinguished himself in tho
decisive little of the Atlanta campaign
July 21 .ISC4, when he defeated Geo
ood a desperate movemaul to the
reur '. tb Army of the Tennessee.
Later while standing sn s trencn be
fore Atlanta, General Dodge was shot
and severely wounded in the heud.
After the full of Virksburg he re
eivcl appreciative recognition from
GenciHl Hraut, boiug promoted to major
geneml aud given command or tne Six
teenth Army Corps.
The hanging of "Sain" Davis, a Con
federate spy who was captured in Ten

Uenerul Hodge's esreer. On Dsvis were
were fuuud complete plana of the fortl-
flcatioiiK at Nashville, which, evidently,
be had received from some federal of-
-ficer high in authority. General Dodge
offered the young spy bis freedom it be
would reveal the name of bis informant
but the accused man refused. Half a
dotuu time before sending the man to
the gallows, General Dodge offered him
immunity. Tho spy went to his death
with hiit lips closed.
"He was tho bravest man that over
died." Kui.l General Dodge. .
When General Dodge retired in Isou.
It was to go back to railroad building.
Once, in the meantime, Lincoln had sum.
nioneu Dodge t9 Washington for s .con
ference on the route. Dodge suggested
Omaha iim tho Eastern terminus of the
rallwav un.l it was at his suggestion
that thi decision wss made. Work had
'progressed but slowly, however, up to
1800, when Dodge took marge again.
By May, 167 ho bad 12,000 men sldng

years the last spike was driven.
In ad.iitiou to his military service and
