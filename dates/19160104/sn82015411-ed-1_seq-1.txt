CLERK IS SHORT
AROUND $20,00,0
Hans Reichelt, assistant book
keeper for the Lihue Plantation
Company, was taken into custody
by Sheriff Rice last Tuesday, pend
ing a complete investigation of his
accounts.
A considerable shortage has
since developed, and the case has
been remanded to the grand jury
for such action as may be deemed
proper.
Reichelt has made good a part
of his shortage, some being in
cash and some in secuiities.
The known shoitage is about
S19.000, of which $6,806 05 ap
pears to have been wrongly divert
ed in the past twelve month. The
irregularities extended over a peri
od of nearly six years.
Reichelt had been in tne employ
of the Lihue plantation for a great
many years and the utmost confi
dence was placed in him. He was
the time-keeper and had a desk in
the general offices of the company
The money was more or less sys
tematically extracted through the
payrolls, and done in such way
that detection was not easy in
fact had to come largely by acci
dent, if it all.
No blame whatever is attached
to anyone else connected with the
company, unless, indeed, misplac

Reichelt has a homestead in the
Waipouli region which he has im

being, however, in the name of his

MAKAWELI DANCE
A GREAT SUCCESS
The Makaweli Boys certainly en
tertained in grand style on New
Year's Eve, the occasion being a
masquerade ball at the social hall
in that town. The crowd was one
ot the largest and jolliest assem
bled on Kauai in a long while, and
merriment reigned supreme
throughout the hours until the
early morning.
The social hall was elaborately
and beautifully decorated, and in
it the banquet, feature was spread
on long tables. Dancing was in a
specially constructed lanai on the
lawn.
The costuming was probably the
most varied and extensive ever at
tempted or seen on this island
Many of the schemes were almost
startlingly good, and a committee
of judges would luu'e had a hard
time deciding upon the best ones.
The Coneys, of Lihue, and a band
of Indians, the idea of. Mr. and H.
C. Brown, of Waimea, were at
once striking as were also, how
ever, many others.
At 12 o'clock ihc New Year was
for in a 1 1 y announced, fireworks
were set off and there were rounds
of congratulations and good wish
es. This was a cleverly conceived
and pleasing feature.
On the whole the affair was a
signal success, everybody having a
most delightful time.

ROW RICE TRIED TD
GET CONVENTION
(Special Washington correspondence of THE
GARDEN ISLAND. )
Washington, D. C. Dec. 15,
National Committeman Charles A.
Rice, of Kauai, made an earnest
effort to have Hawaii give'i larger
representation in the coming Na
tional convention of the Republican
party. He offered a resolution to
providethat Hawaii should have six
delegjtes.and should be accorded at
least three votes in the convention.
It was held, however, that the Na
tional Committee did not have the
authority to fix the representation
for the next convention and that
this authority existed only in the
convention itself. Informally, the
Committee advised Mr. Rice to
have six delegates attend the con
vention fiom Hawaii and assured
him that the members of the Com
mittee would as individuals use
their influence in having the dele
gates seated in tin convention and
given a vote in its proceedings.
The Washinton Times of yester
day gave Mr. Rice the following
publicity:
Chock full of promises and proph
ecy. Charles A. Rice, the Repu
blican national committeeman from
Hawaii, is in Washington to bag
the next Republican national con
vention for Honolulu. Mr. Rice
not only has tempting financial
propositions to make to the com
mittee, but paints the attractions
of a convention in his island in
hues as auroral as the Hawaiian
sky.
The convention, however, is not
the only thing that Mr. Rice wants
for Hawaii. He would like to get
back the two votes which Hawaii
formerly had in the convention so
that his constituents may have a
voice in the affairs of his partv.
"Hawa.i wants the next Repub
lican national convention, and Ho
nolulu is in the racs, "declared Mr
Rice.
"The financial cud is an easy
matter," he said. "Not only will
Honolulu meet the requirements
by putting up the 8100,000 neces
sary to defray the expenses of the
convention, but the Hawaiian peo
ple will provide steamers to carry
the delegates, so that there will be
no expenses to these gentlemen
for the greatest ten days' sea trip
in the world."
"As a convention city," he de
clared "there is nothing like Ho
nolulu. It is the gulden spot of
the world.
"The one danger however, to
the country," he added, "is that
the thousand or so dele), ates who
will make up the convention should
Honolulu be selected, may decide
to stay on forever in Hawaii and
desert their native state."
Mr. Rice is urging that the com
mittee reverse itself and give two
voting delegates to Hawaii. The
Hawaiian votes were taken away
when the committee eliminated
Porto Rico and the Philippines
from a voice in the naming ot
candidates. The District of Colum
bia and Alaska are allowed two
delegates.
Mr. Rice says the consensus of
opinion is that a mistake was made
when Hawaii was deprived of its
two votes. There is a general feel
ing he said, that the wrong will
be lighted, but it is believed, he
added, that this cannot be done
until the next convention meets.
Arthur H. Rice, of Lihue. now
residing in Honolulu, has been ap
pointed chairman of the board f
agriculture and forestry to succeed
Albert Waterhouse, resigned.
