HOT SPRINGS. Va.. Jan. 3. Presi
dent Wilson left here tonight at S:43
for Washington, after a series of tele
phone conferences with the capital re
garding intet national affairs. He
goes to take l ersonal charge of the
situation growing out of the sinking
of the British liner Persia in the
Mediterranean.
The president declined to make any
comment further than to announce his
decision to return to AVashington at
nee, cutting short his honeymoon by
two days. The situation is regarded
in official circles as being the most
serious to confront this government
since the submarine operations of the
central powers began.
The president probably will lay the
facts thus far established before his
cabinet tomorrow. The destruction of
the Persia, following closely upon the
crisis precipitated by the Ancona dis
aster, may result in (he United States
determining to settle immediately all
the questions involved in the subma
rine warfare. The subject i.-? expected
to find its way to the floor of the
house, and senate t'mioiuiv when con
gress reconvenes after the holiday
1 He United States is represented as
i'cing prepared and determined to take
any action that the facts concerning
th? Persia, yet to be established, nay
warrant. Officials still are trying to
ieiv the situation with an open mind,
but it is apparent that they are dis
turbed by the reports received from
consular agents at Alexandria and
'airo, Egypt. Every effort will be
made t0 establish tho truth of the re
pent that the Persia, was torpedoed
without warning. Secretary Lansing
contemplates taking no step until the
complete details are known.
Officials find one source of gratifica
tion in assurances given by Baron
Erich Zwiedinek, charge of the Austro
Jlungarian embassy, to Secretary Lan
sing during a conference today at the
state department. Baron Zvv.edine'; is
said to have suggested that the Judg
ment be withheld until the facts wore
known and to have expressed the be
olief that the final explanatin of the
latest incident would be satisfactory.
He is said to have assured the secre
tary of his belief that if an Austrian
submarine commander violated the
principles of international law and the
rules of humanity, his government
would be quick to take action which
will be fully satisfactory t the United
States. Baron Zwiedinek also sought
information for the benefit of his gov
ernment. Secretary Lansing tor'ay
instructed

Ambassador Penfield at Vienna to
make informal inquiries which might
lead to the establishment of the identi
ty of the submarine which sank the
Persia or the receipt of information
concerning the circumstances of tho
attack.
The secretary acted i pon it-formation
received .from an undisclosed source
that no submarines of other than Aus
trian nationality were known to hie
operating near the point where t lie
Persia went down. No specific instruc
tions were given to Ambassador Pen
field. He is expected to proceed as he
thinks beat and forward any informa
tion obtainable.
officials here are not finally con
icced that, a submarine was respon
sible for the sinking of the Persia, and
still see a remote possibility that the
vessel might have struck a floating
mire which hat drifted to that nart of
he sea from adjacent fields of opera
tions. The report that the liner was
carrying a 4.7 inch gun served to re
vive consideration of the position
taken by the United States in
regard to armed merchantmen,
ned tile early days of the war it
was announced that merchant ships
belonging to belligerents might be al
lowed to enter and leave Ameri'-an
waters with guns of six inch calibre
or less, mounted upon their stems.
At that time cruisers of the central
powers had not been swept from the
seas. Later Great Britain and France,
at the suggestion of the United Suites,
agreed that their ships coming into
American waters should not he armed,
ihus eliminating the possibility of a
controversy over that point so far as
vessels plying out of rorts of the
United States were concerned.
Since then a!i war craft of the Teu
tonic allies, with the exception of
submarines, have disappeared from the
high seas. Consequently, it is con
sidered in some quarters that mer
chantmen mounting guns even of small
calibre astern, might be considered
prepared for resisting a hostile sub
marine. Secretary Lansing and other
officials have considered this view
with great carefulness. The secretary
vicl today he was not prepared to an
nouiicc the attitude of the United
Stales on this point in the future. It
is understood that he was awaiting an
opportunity to discuss the matter and
its various ramifications with Presi
dent Wilson.
Tie Italian ambassador, c'ount I i
Cellere. called on Mr. Lansing during
the afternoon, seeking information on
the question. He was referred to 'the
position taken by the United State.-- at
the beginning of the war, which was
in line with the provisions of The
Hague convention permitting arma
ment for defensive purposes.
During a later discussion of the sub
ject. Secretary La.nsing revealed that

Germany had abandoned its contention
that the Lusitania was an armed mer
chantman. This claim was originally
made in justification of the sinking of
that ship, and .affidavits wero present
ed to substantiate it. The affidavits
were proven to be false, how ever, and
Mr. Lansing indicated I hat Germany
had dropped the contention some
time ago.
The Japanese ambassador, Visc unit
Chir.da. also called on the secretary.
His purpose was to obtain any details
which might have been received re
garding the sinking 0f the Japanese
liner Yasaka Maru. The sec retary said
no reports of importance had been re
cehed. He indicated that no action
would lie taken by the Uni.ed States
in that case, at least not at this time.
Rut one person aboard the Yasaka
Maru was supposed to be an American
citizen. He was W. J. Leigh. A dis
patch received today from Consul Gar
rels at Alexandria, informed the state
department that Leigh, who was born
in China of American parrots, never
had elocted to claim American citizen
ship. His status may be the subject
of a further report, however, as it is
pointed out thnt the United States
maintains extra territorial jurisdic tion
in China, and if Leigh was born of
American parents within the juris Jic
tiop of any American consulin China
he eourl he considered ,;n .American
citizen unless he elected to become a
subject of some other nation.
Anxiety in official circles increased
tonight when it was learned that press
dispatches from London reported the
sinking of another British liner, the
Porinsular and Oriental steamer Gee
long. No word of the latest disaster
had reached the state department. Of
fical reports will be awaited tomorrow
with grave interest.
CARRIED OU
people-, as expresed Ijv the last legis
lature and at the special election of
October 25, 1915, is being carried out
through the amendment of the pri
mary laws to meet the requirements
of non-partisan registration. The
statement follows:
"At the special election of Oe-toher
26. the sole quoFtion was whether state
officials should be elected in partisan
or non-partisan fashion. Those who
voted at that election decided that our
state officers should be chosen In
partisan fashion. This decision is, of
course, controlling, and by all of us
should be given full efiect. The last
legislature passed a new registration
bill which was in accordance with the
views of the County Clerks' Associa
tion and followed the procedure tif
many of our sister states. This regis
tration bill provided that no voter
hereafter would be required to state
his politics at the time of registration.
This registration bill has been neither
attacked nor challenged. It has been
acciuiesced in by all the peopie and is
today the law of the land. We have,
therefore, decision of the people, Oc
tober 26, that state officeials be nom
inated and elected in partisan fashion
and a law of the land solemnly passed
and unanimously agreed to. that regis
tration be without party designation.
The duty of those entrusted with gov
ernment is plain to carry out the will
ef the people as expressed at the spe
cial election and to maintain the law
of the land p.cquiesced in by all alike.
This can be readily and speedily ac
complished by amenc'ment of th
primary law and cannot be readily and
speedily accomplished in any other
manner. The amendment in order to
accomplish both purposes need provide
only that the declaration of party
affiliation shall be made at the time of
the primary instead of at the registra
tion. By doing this, political parties
are enabled to nominate candidates,
and state officials are elee-ted in par
tisan fashion, and the registration law
which lias passed the scrutiny of all
of the people of the state, is preserved."
EXPLOSION
WRECKS OIL BOAT
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
NEW YORK, Jan. 3. One man is
dead and eleven others are known to
be missing as a result of an explosion
that wrecked the engine room of the
Norwegian oil tank steamer Aztec at a
I'.rooklyn dock today. The dead man
was a fireman on the vessel and five1
of the missing men were members of
the crew. The other six were em
ployed on the dock.
Seven were injured, three of them
seriously.
Most of the victims were trapped
below decks and those who were not
instantly killed probably were drowned
by the water that flooded the engine
room through a great hole blown
in the side of the vessel.
Fire Marshal lirophy, after an inves
tigation, said the explosion was caused
by gases pocketed in the bilges and
crevices aboard the tanks and supports.

OKOVILLE, Calif.. Jan. ."..--The erec
tion of an addition to a county build
ing is a legislative and not an adminis

a decision handed down today by

The decision was given in connection
with a case through which a writ of

county .supervisors to compel them to
call a referendum election on the pro
