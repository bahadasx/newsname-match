Railroads which lost money under

That was the fear expressed today by
Joseph I- Bristows public utilities
commission at the resumption of the

lav of eitht months.
Warm and decidedly personal sen
timents were expressed by the lawyers
today.

Kansas & Texas railroad displayed al
most open defiance to the state com
mission. W. W. lirown of Parsons, at
torney for the railroad, told the com
missioners in substance that questions
had been asked about matters which
did not affect the rate case and in no
manner concerned the commission.
"We haven't stated, if you please,
that the matters involving these ques
tions are nom of tne commissions

ome such a remark in our personal
discussion of the matter." said lirown.
Jloads Say They I-"' Money.
Nearly the entire morning session
'was spent in a discussion of the num
erous questions submitted to ihc rail
roads regarding their operating ex
penses ;.nd revenues. Some f the
rnilrotris had not answered these
questions in detail. Neither the Mis

questions refill rcliriK valuations and

Brown assured Jackson and the
commission that the roads were will
ing, to take a chance on an increased
rate. Then Jackson went into the
failure ol the road t j report its valua
tions in (ietail.
"I don't regard the valuation ques
tion material to this hearins," re
sponded i'.rown. "We have lost mon
ey. It doesn't matter whether it was
on a vnluation of a dollar or ten mil-
linn. Besklt s. if you want valuations,
why don't you take those of the state
tax commission ? It ill becomes one
branch of the state government to as-
sump that anoth r is not doing its duty
and the railroad valuations were made
by the tax commission in good faith."
Lavyrs for the railroads were in
clined to show genuine feeling in their
remarks to the commission and thi
opening session of the rate case indi
cated no desir to conceal opinion as
to the commission's delay of more
than a year in disposing of the case.
"When we try a lawsuit and our
evidence is all in, we expect the court
or commission to decide that case
either for or against us," sarcastically
remarked lirown. Then the lawyer
tndicatrd that the railroads would like
some ttatenient as to when a decision
might be expected in the rate case.
The commission did not reply.

WILSON SERIOUS
Issues ' Official Statement on
Persia Affair.
Situation Grave; Seeking Facts,
He States.
Washington, Jan. 4. President Wil
on todav issued a statement in which
i he admitted that the present situation
between the United States and Austria!
i.w very grave. He added that he was
co-operating with Secretary of State
Lansing in an effort to obtain full
facts, and as soon as this information
is obtained this government will act
promptly.
The statement, issued through Sec
retary Tumulty, follows:
"The president and secretary of
state are taking every means possible
to obtain the full fact? in this grave
matter and will act just as soon as the
information is obtained."
The president decided not to cal! his
cabinet together today but conferred
with Chairman Stone, of the senate
foreign relations committee, and will
confer with Secretary of State Lansing
in an effort to gather all the evidence
on the Persia's sinking.
That the situation today is very
critical was admitted at the White
Hou.oe without reservations'.
May Send Message to Congress.
Later Chairman Flood of the house
foreign affairs committee called at
the White House and conferred with
President Wilson on the situation.
White House officials said both the
aerate and the house would be kept
intorrnd or all important develop
ments in the foreign situation, proba
bly through conference between the
president and senate and house lead
ers, although if any drastic action is
taken it is possible that the president
mav send a message to congress after
getting in touch generally with the
situation.
The administration is depending
largely on the inquiries which Ambas
sador Penfitld had been instructed to
make at Vienna and that which con
suls are gathering elsewhere, to estab
lish the nationality of the submarine
which is said to have sunk the Persia
and to develop the facts in the case
generally. Senator Stone told the
president that when the foreign rela
tions committee meets tomorrow he
wants to be prepared to meet any sit

Returns to Washington Today and

Washington, Jan. 4. President
Wilson today took charge of the crisis
over submarine operations. He re
turned from his honeymoon at Hot
Springs, confronted by the most seri
ous diplomatic dilemma of the war as
it affects future United States rela
tions. The president and Mrs. Wilson ar
rived at 7:45 in a private car attached
to the regular Chesapeake & Ohio
railway train from Hot Springs. Co
incident with the president's return,
congress reassembled today and
promised to take a prominent part in
the expected international denoue
ments, j
From all quarters the White j
House, state department and capitol,
came indications that prompt, deci-
sive steps to stop illegal submarine
warfare were under way. Immediate
plans of the president regarding the
sinking of the Persia and other sub
marine victims were:
A conference with Secretary of
State Lansing.
A cabinet council.
A conference with Senator Stone,
chairman of the senate foreign rela
tions committee.
GERMANY SORRY
Expression of Regret General
Over Persia Sinking.
Had Hope Teuton-American
Relations Were Repaired.
BY CARL W. ACKERMAX.
Berlin, Jan. 4. Regret is expressed
almost universally in Berlin over the
sinking of the British liner. Persia,
with a heavy loss of life, just as he
roic efforts were being made to repair
Teuton-American relations.
The public understood that the last
Austrian note had cleared the way for
a complete understanding. The news-
papers, too, took the view that the
submarine question had at last been
settled. Consequently, the sinking of
the Persia came as a severe shock.
No information has reached here as
to whether a German or Austrian sub
marine sank the Persia. Officials de
clined to comment until the report of
the submarine commander has been
received.
The newspapers carried English re
ports of the sinking of the Persia, to-
gether with English reports of its ef-
feet in America. Generally, the press
refrains from comment, suspecting
that the reports from English sources
may be misleading.

HERE'S TO PEAC
Congressman Phil Campbell of
Kansas Solves Problem.
Files Bill In Congress Which
"Would Abolish War."
FORM INTERNATIONAL BODY
Composed of 96 Members From
AH World's Nations.
t
Pnrtn IMro Simro-pcfpn n Sent of
the 'ow Government.
Washington, Jan. 4. Congressman
Phil Campbell, of Kansas, introduced
a resolution today which, he says, if
adopted as proposed, will abolish war.
It provides for an international con
federation with a seat of government,
an international congress, and an in
ternational court.
The purpose of the resolution and
the constitution, Mr. Campbell has
prepared and introduced along with
the resolution, proposes the precise
enactment of international law by a
federal congress, the interpretation of
international law by a supreme court,
and its execution by an executive.
Provision is made in the constitution
for the election of an international
federal house of representatives, com
posed of 22 5 members apportioned
among the nations of. the world, ac
cording to their voting population, and
an international senate composed of
96 members apportioned among the
nations of the world according to their
international commerce.
Provision is made for an interna
tional president, and an international
supreme court in a joint session of the
international congress.
Mr. Campbell has suggested Porto
Rico as the seat of government for
the reason, he says, that It is far re
moved from European, Asiatic and
American influence.
A martial force, to be taken from
among the armies- and navies of the
world, is to be taken over by the in
ternational federation as a martial
force to aid in the execution of the
international constitution and laws,
and to suppress insurrections and re
bellions against its authority.
While many suggestions have been
j made for the establishment of courts
and a more definite agreement as to
international law, Mr. Campbell's reso
lution and proposed constitution is the
first concrete suggestion on the sub
ject. NO WAR FOR THEM
Unmarried Ien of England Did
Not Volunteer.
Looks Now Like Conscription
3Iust Come.
London Jan. 4. Only 53 per cent
of the unmarried youth and men of
military age in Oreat Britain volun
teered for service in the British
armies in the six weeks' recruiting
i campaign inaugurated by Lord Derby
to ODtain new torces Tor the war.
Official announcement of this fact
was made today. At the same time it
was said that the cabinet met in a
brief session today and completed the
draft of the compulsory service bill
to be presented to parliament this
week.
The official statement confirmed
previous reports that the Lord Derby
campaign had proven a failure. It
was made public by the government
to show why it was necessary to
adopt some form of conscription. It
called attention to the fact that 651,
160 men can be added to the British
armies by drafting only single men of
military age who are not urgently
needed in other occupations.
The surprising feature of the report
was the statement that about 59 per
cent of the married men of military
age responded, whereas only 53 per
cent of the single men offered them
selves for service.

SHE TOjrc DRUGS
Dr. Merrill Lindsay Testifies in
the Ernest Case.
Says Plaintiff Told Him She
Had Taken Morphine.
DEFENDANT CROSS EXAMINED
Says Marital Troubles Date
Back About Five Years.
Continuous Performance Was
Staged Through Entire Time.
The fact that Mr. Klvenor Ann
Ernest took drugs and constantly
nagged at her husband. Dr. F. J.
Ernest, whom she is suing for $10,000
alimony and separate maintenance in
the Shawnee county district court, was
brought out in court this morning.
Dr. Merrill Lindsay, who was called
to the stand late this morning, stated
that Mrs. Ernest had told him many
of her troubles and that she one time
told him that she took morphine.
"That was about two years ago," ex
plained Ztr. Lindsay in answer to a
question from Judge Z. T. Hazen, Mrs.
Ernest's attorney. "It was before the
pistol affair. I was called to attend
Mrs. Ernest, who was in a nervous
condition. Mrs. Ernest told me that
she took morphine but I am not sure
whether she did or not. Her mother
was with her and she took the bottle
away from her."
Dr. Lindsay testified that on several
occasions Mrs. Ernest had told him
that Er- Ernest was paying attention
to several women and that he would
not pay any attention to her when she
wanted them ordered out of his office.
"I advised Mrs. Ernest not to bother
about that and everything would be all
right. She agreed to do that," Dr.
Lindsay stated.
Cross-Exami nation.
The cross-examination of Dr. Ernest
consumed most of the time this morn
ing. Judge Hazen asked Dr. Ernest
about the gifts, flowers, and lunches
he had bought for Miss Edith Knox,
who is named by Mrs. Ernest as co-respondent
in this suit.
"Didn't you keep Miss Knox's pic
ture on your desk when you knew
your wife didn't like it?" asked Judge
Hazen.
"I kept it there until Mrs. Ernest
swiped it," was the answer.
"Did you ever know that your wife
was in a delicate physical condition?"
queried Judge Hazen.
"Not to my knowledge," said Dr.
Ernest.
"Was her condition such when she
went to her folks at Marysville, Kas. ?'
"Not that I know of. She had her
own friends from whom she obtained
medical advice.
After the questions about Mrs. Er
nest's delicate physical condition
Judge Hazen again shifted his queries
to Miss Knox.
"When did your wife begin com
plaining about Miss Knox ?" Hazen
asked.
"It was in the fall of 1908 or in
1909 I believe. She said that Miss
Knox was too forward."
Threatened Suic-ide.
"Did your wife ever tell you that
she was going to commit suicide?"
"She did."
"What did you do?"
I didn t do anything. She had
talked so much that I paid little atten
tion to her."
"You didn't care whether she did or
not. is that the idea?" asked Hazen.
"Yes, that is it. I cared only so far
as it would implicate me.
"Why did Mrs. Ernest say that she
was going to take her own life?"
"Because she said that I did not ap
preciate her capability. She said that
her life was not pleasant."
"How many times did she threaten
to commit suicide?" was the next
question.
"Oh, a number of times. So many
times that T paid little attention to
her."
At this point in the testimony Judge

board of five appointed by the presi
dent for ten years each.
Loans would be made to farmers by
twelve or more federal land banks
each operating in a separate district
with capital of not less than $500,000
which would be taken by the govern
ment if not privately subscribed. The
land banks would loan to farmers and
to local associations of borrowers.
called national farm loan associations.
Every borrower would be required
to take stock in the association to the
amount of 5 per cent of his loan. A
limit of 36 years would be placed on
loans.

SIR JOHN RESIGNS
English Secretary of State Quits
Cabinet in a Huff.
Controversy Orer Conscription
Bill a Thorny Problem,
London, Jan. 4. It again became
evident today that the cabinet crisis is
far from ended. The only definite
point is that Sir John Simon, secretary
ci state for home affairs, has resigned.
He had a prolonged interview with
Premier Asquith yesterday. The pre
mier did his utmost to induce Sir John
to remain in the cabinet but without
avail. Announcement was made in"
the house of commons today of the
resignation.
The position of Reginald McKenna,
chancellor of the exchequer, and Wal
ter Runciman, president of the board
of trade, still is undecided. They are
making the acceptance of the govern
ment compulsion bill conditional upon
securing a concession to their views on
the eventual size of the army. In this
matter Premier Asquith is in an em
barrassing position. He is being
strongly impelled from the outside not
to yield this point and it is believed
that a majority in the cabinet itself is
against their views. Hence today's

detailed account. yet received on the
disaster.
"I was in the dining saloon of the
Persia at 1:05 p. m.," he said. "I had
Just finished my soup and the steward
was asking what I would take for my
second course when a terrific ex
plosion occurred.
"The saloon became filled with
smoke, broken glass and steam from
the boilers which appeared to have
burst. There was no panic on board.
We went on deck as though we were
at drill and reported at the lifeboats
on the starboard side, as the vessel
had listed to port. I clung to the rail
ing. The last thing done was to ti
on Captain Sprickly's lifebelt.
Caught in Wreckage.
"As the vessel was then listing so
badly that ft was impossible to launch
the starboard boats I slid down the
starboard railing to the water. I got
caught in a rope which pulled off a
shoe, but I broke loose and climbed
on some floating wreckage, to which
I clung.
"The last I saw of the Persia she
had her bow in the air, five minutes
after the explosion.
"After floating about on the wreck
age until 4 o'clock in the- morning, t
-Miw five boats. I was pulled into one
of them. We rowed about looking fur
other stragglers.
"The boats became overloaded and
the occupants were redistributed. Four
boats were tied together and the fifth
followed some distance away.
"My boat left the others in order to
search the more frequented steamship
channels for help. We rowed for thrpe
hours. Then we ww a cruiser and
called out: 'We are English. We ex
plained that we were survivors of the
Persia and gave directions to the
cruiser as to where the other boats
were. They were soon found and the
occupants were taken off immediately
by the English sailors.
MeNeoly His Companion.
"Robert McNeely, American consul
at Aden, sat at the same table with me
on the voyage. He was not seen prob
ably because his cabin was on the
port side.
"It was a horrible srene. The water
was black as ink. Some passengers
were screaming, others were calling
out goodbye. Those in one boat sang
hymns."
