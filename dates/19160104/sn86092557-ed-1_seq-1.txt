PBESIDENT UKES HIM
Also Has High Regard For
His Intellectual Attain
ments.
WASHINGTON. D. C.. Jan. 4.?
Will John W. Davis, Solicitor Gener
al of the United States and one of
West Virginia's foremost citizens, be
appointed to the bench of the United
States Supreme Court to All the va
cancy created by tne death of Jus
tice Lamar?
That is a question that all West Vir
ginians iu Washington are asking,
and a great many others who are
not West Virginians. In all the figur
ing and calculating going on over who
is likely to receive this big appoint
ment, it is significant that Solicitor
General Davis's name is never omit
ted.
The reasons for this are that an
intimacy has grown up between Pres
ident Wilson and tiieman from. West
Virginia founded on a mutual high
regard. The President is known . to
have more than once spoken in the
most complimentary manner^-of the
intellectual attainment^ of the Solici
tor General, emphasizing especially
his respect for. Mr.XDavis'a'legal ^bll-j
that, should apporfrmity^bfMr ft
self to the~ l^eWident to'elevate Davis
to a higher position, ho would gladly
take advantage of it. The public's
idea of it was that Mr. Davis stood
in an enviable position with the Pres
dent to get a promoton either to the
Supreme Court bench or to the Cabi
net.
Many thing will figure in making an
appontment of tnis magnitude, and
nobody knows what the President will
do. It is more than likely that ho
does not know himself at thi3 time.
But everybody is guessing what he
may do, and one man's guess is as
good as others. In tho list of prob
abilities most often given the namo of
Solicitor Davis always figures, as has
been stated, in a preferential position
along with the names of Secretary of
War Garrison, Secretary Lane, Secre
tary Houston, Councellor Jos. W.
Folk, of the Interstate Commerce
Commission and Frederick W. Loh
mann, former Solicitor General of tho
Department of Justice.

ian at Cook hospital where he re
mained until after tho death of Dr. J.

ENTRY TIME
Exhibits Will Come From
This State and Neigh
boring States.
For those who like to roam around
poultry shows and who occasionally
go Into ecstales over the antics of
the feathered specie, the Fairmont
Poultry and Pet Stock Association
lias arranged a good treat. Besides
the fowl of high degree there will be
the regular nature fake exhibition.
But this exhibit will be the real goods.
As an added attraction and a sort
of a novelty for those who are not
chicken fanciers, but who wish to visit
the Armory, tho Fairmont exhibition
will contain one four-legged hen In
good health and a pair of chickens
which are not chlckons. This latter
paradox la a team composed of a
pullet and a rooster which are half
leghorn and half pheasunt, both In
good condition. These three birds
come from .Monongalia county and
aro tho property of one man who
makes business of collecting freaks.
They will be on display all during the
chow here.
The time for entries to close for
the poultry show to be held Janu
ary 10 was extended until January
6, at a meeting held last night over
tho offices of Ell Musgrove. The pre
vious dato was January 1, but on ac
count of a hold up in getting birds
back from other exhibitions the direc
tors of tho Fairmont Poultry and Pet
Stock Association decided to allow
oxlilblta In until January 6.
Exhibitors from all over the state
and western Pennsylvania and Ohio
have entered coops and many moro
aro now oxpoctod since the date of
entry has been extended live days.
W. F. Auerswald" reputed to be
the strictest judce in tho poultry show
business, will 'officiate here. Mr.
Auerswald Is well known around Fair
mont and this section and his selec
tion has been met with approval from
all exhibitors. Tho show opens Jan
uary 10 and closds January 15.

Charles Grant of Boston, 0110 ol two
Americans known to havo been aboard
the British ship Persia when she was
torpedoed in the Mediterranean on
Thursday, has arrived in Alexandria.
Mr. Grant, so far as is known, Is the
only American from whom can come
tho story of the Persian sinking. He
save to tho Associated Press today the
most detailed account of the disaster
yet received.
"I was standing in the dining saloon
of the Persia at 1:05 p. .m," he said.
*1 had Just finished my soup and the
Bteward was just asking what 1 would
take for the second course when a ter

"As the vessel was then listing so
