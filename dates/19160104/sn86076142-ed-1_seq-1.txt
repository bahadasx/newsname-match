Public Schools
After thoroughly enjoying the vaca
tion granted by the city board of edu
cation, teachers and pupils yesterday
look tip their school duties with re
newed energy. On account of the
storm yesterday, a number of the little
people in the lower grades were un
able to get to school. Today, however,
the attendance Is again back to nor

various grades of the ichool and this

Here Is what yesterday's Gazette
has to say editorially. It Is liable to
plunge that newspaper into gloom and
Its editor Into Jail. It is another case
of lese nvajeste, such as the poor, un
fortunate W. W. Hooth is alleged to
have committed. Attorney generals,
county commissioners and district at

have tarvia thrown at them in these

"Without any desire to anticipate ju

made by the state, on the advice of
Attorney General Thatcher, for all the
money collected by the county treas
urer for state liquor licenses in this
city, it surely will occur to the people
of Nevada that the selection of a
humorist to act as legal adviser at
Carson is at times expensive and not
infrequently annoying.
"There Is scarcely a person who
watched the progress of the licensing
bill through the legislature who does
not know the Intent of the author of
the bill and the understanding of Its
supporters that, in the matter of state
licenses, half the sum collected was

Last evening James Skelton and Lou
Conlcy called at his cabin to see him
on a matter of business, but got no
reply to their raps. This morning Mr.
Skelton went again and could not gain
admission. 'He noticed something
rather suspicious in that the key was
in the lock on the outsida and the
screen door fastened.
He summoned Chief of Police Evans
and the latter smashed in the door.
Mr. Grant was fully covered with bed
ding, but he had removed one shoe
and sock. He had evidently been
taken ill while disrobing, as shown
by the vomit on the floor beside the

General Greenville Dodge died yes--terday.
Two notable services to his coun

valor Is attested by the fact that four
horses were shot from under him in
the battle of Pea Ridge, and that he
