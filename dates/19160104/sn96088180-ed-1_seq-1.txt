SAYS PRESIDENT WILSON
Executive Summons Leaders to a Conference, and in a
Statement Says That He Will Act Promptly When De
tails of the Sinking of the Persia Are Received, the
Affair Having Complicated International Matters
Washington, Jan. 4. President
Wilson issued a statement today in
which bo admitted' that tbo situation
between Austria and America la very
grave. He Is co-operating with Sec
retary Lansing in an effort to got full
facts as to recent submarine activi
ties, and as soon aa three are ob
tained be will act promptly. The
statement, issued through Secretary
Tumulty, ald;
"The president and secretary of
state are taking every means possible
to obtain facta in this grave matter,
and will act Just as soon a informa
tion la obtained."
The grave matter referred to was
the sinking of the Persia and other
liner, following closely on Austria'
reply in the Ancona case.
The president decided not to call
the cabinet today, but he conferreed
with Chairman Stone of the senate
foreign affair committee and will
confer with Secretary Lansing In an
effort to gather all available evi
dence In the (Persia sinking. That the
situation la very critical, the White
House admitted unreservedly.
' a Li. - . . ... ... i
ur ma couierence wun tne pre
sident, Senator Stone declared that
the administration, at present, lacks
facta concerning (he Persia, and that
nothing will be done until these are
Cbtalned. . ; "" '
Chairman Flood of the house for
eign affair committee, followed
Stone to the White House and it was
learned that the president had sum
moned both. From thia It was as
sumed that he perhaps desired to
take them somewhat Into the con
fidence of the administration.
Officials do not regard evidence
thus far at hand In the Persia case
aa conclusive of torpedoing. Navy
authorities say that possibly she
struck a mine, and in support of this
theory they pointed to the fact that
the quick' plunge she took made the
torpedoing theory eomewhat doubtful.
SURVIVORS VIEW HORRIBLE SCEHE
AS PERSIA" PLUNGES WITH 1
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
London, Jan. 4. Scenes of horror
preceded the plunge of the P. & O.
liner Persia, victim of a submarine,
in the Mediterranean.
She turned turtle while lifeboats
were getting away from her elde. The
waves washed more than a score of
passengers from the deck. Then the
giant ship dipped sharply, sending
shrieking women and children slip
ping into the water. Before the eyes
of survivors, she rolled over and
went down while a score Btlll clung
to the decks.
The admiralty today abandoned
hope that American Consul McNeely
had been saved, although 11 persons,
including Lord Montagu, were re
ported tn late advices to have landed
at Malta. Official still estimate that
from 260 to 300 persons perished.
Consul McNeely was In the cabin
when the ship wa hit, and wa one
of tho lost lo reach the deck, sur
vivors said. 'Most of the other mis.
sensors were At luncheon, without a
thought of danger. Those on deck
strapped On life belts while the crew
worked with the lifeboat. Nearly
70 crowded Into one boat; when it
etruck the water, the wave, lapped
over It and threatened to sink It.
"GRAVE"
The presence of guns aboard the
fersla complicate future rather than
immediate action. The main fact of
no warning remains.
: It la lmporbable that a submarine
could see guns on. the Persia; and
whether, these were for offensive or
defensive action 1b a question for
future discussion in the matter of
technicalities. ,
The president, too, conferred with
congressional leaders, including
Chairman Stone of the senate foreign
committee and Chairman Flood of
tbo house foreign committee, and be
called a meeting of the senate foreign
committee for tomorrow.
While he decided not to call a cab
inet session today, he summoned
Stone 'and Flood to discuss the situ
atloa with them in order that he
might have their co-operation In caae
a breach In relations with the central
powers becomes necessary.
After these conferences, It waa of
ficially stated that no action will he
taken until further detail of the
Persia caae are at hand. However,
the Intensity and delicacy of the altn
atlon permeated the White House.
the 'etate department, congress and
diplomatic circles. On every hand
the talk showed that authorities look,
ed at the recent torpedoing, follow
ing o closely on Austria' Ancona
note.: aa presenting aa omlnou altn
atlon. , , . ',,.,. ,
A a result of their conferences.
Stone and. Flood prepared to prevent
discussion of. international problems
on the floor of congress.
Adjournment of the senate eased
thl task, inasmuch a several mem
ber were primed for a verbal explo
alon. ...';":. '
The president and chairmen dis
cussed all eventualities, and the
freest consultation and ce-operation
between congress and the White
House was assured if breaking of
diplomatic relations becomes neces
sary.
Thereupon some were transferred to
another boat
Many survivor leaped from the
careening ship, or were washed from
the deck before she sank. Several
floated for hours, desperately cling
ing to bits of wreckage.
The sound of hymns rose from
those in the lifeboats, above the
screams of women and children, as
survivors -struggled in the water
alongside the Persia, Charles H.
Grant, of Boston, said today at Alex
andria, according to press dispatches.
Grant was at luncheon, he said,
when there came a sudden explosion
as though the boiler had blown up.
In orderly, manner the paesengers
went oit deck. The starboard boats
could not be put overside because of
the listing. Grant htmself slid off
the ship, entangling his foot in a
rope as he wont overboard. He was
picked tip and then, after rowing
around some time, waa taken aboard
by a British cruiser and taken to
Alexandria.- He Indicated that' the
vessel sank with great rapidity.
E. P. Anthony, a hide dealer of
McMlnnvlile, has been in the city for
several day looking up local busi

Portland, Jan. 4. The Sunday
blue law probably will be enforced

ages, groceries, confectioneries,' and
every other sort of a shop must close.

BRITOIIS FAIL TO
RESPOND TO CALL
TO TAKE UP ARMS
London, Jan. 4. Scarcely more
than half of England's men of mill
tary age came forward to tho call of
"Your King and Country Need You,"
while Lord Derby's conscription cam.
paign waa on. Figures obtained to
day, showed 2,829,261 enlisted out
of 6.011,441 subject to service.
.'i This mean thai only- 64 per -cent
of England's available fighters vol
unteered. These figures, announced
officially, were given out to show the
failure of the Derby scheme and to
prove thai conscription is necessary,
At the same time, the cabinet com
pleted Its conscription hill to force
an increase la England's enlistments,

that 651.160 men can be added br
drafting only unmarried men, not

all of the 651,160 unmarried above
mentioned.
