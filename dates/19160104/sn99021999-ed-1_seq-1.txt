The General' Career.
, The death of General Grenvllle Melletl
Dodge marks the passing of one of Iowa's
most distinguished and best loved citi
zens. It marks tho passing of a man who
was known not only throughout the
length and breadth of his adopted state,
but a man whose name was familiar
throughout the United States and one
whose fame had spread to foreign lands.
General Dodge was the last of the de
partment commanders of the federal
armies of the civil war. He was also the
last of the men who conceived and wc rked
to a conclusion the problem of linking
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans logether
by rail, for it was General Dodge who In
a great measure was responsible for the
construction of the Union Pacific rail
road, much of which was bullded under
his supervision, thus placing his home
city and -Omaha on the great transcon
tinental highway.
F.lghty-Foor Years Old.
General Dodge was born In Putnam
vllle, near Danvers, Mass., April 12. 1831,
HiB father conducted a little bookstore
in the postoffice building In South Dan
vers and here young Dodge worked even
ings during the winter. He was a great
reader and recently he told a caller that
when a. boy In the store he read about
ell the books on the shelves, liking best
those that dealt with scientific topics,
not caring for fiction or anything of the
kind.
Summers young Dodge found employ
ment driving the delivery wajon for the
village butcher. In due time he was
graduated from the village school and In
lS4t! entered the Norwich university at
Norwich. Vt., taking the military and
scientific course. Four years later he was
graduated as a civil engineer and the
following year he entered Captain Part-

A. Schmidt of first degree murder last
Thursday had misconducted Itself, at
torneys for the prisoner made a motion
today for a new trial on the charge that
he murdered Charles Hagerty, one of the
twenty men killed In the blowing up of

ingly to Caplan.
"I did not see anything In the papers
about your confession today," he said.
"You are slow this morning."

printed.
Tho motion submitted today on behalf
of Schmidt, besides citing a large number
of legal points and precedents, alleges
that the Jury which convicted Schmidt

AMERICA PLANS
FORCE AGAINST
COMBINED FOES
Army and Navy Authorities Propose
to Spend Over Billion Dollars
to Defend the Western
Hemisphere,
TO DEFEND MONROE DOCTRINE
Possible Assault by Two Foreign
Powers from Pacific and At
lantio Seen.
SOLDIERS FOR TWIN CONTINENTS
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3. Possibil
ity of a combined attack by two for
eign powers to break down the new
pan-American doctrine evolved from
maintenance by the United . States
and acceptance by South and Central
American republics of the Monroe
doctrine is one of the fundamental
bases for the national defense plans
formulated by army and navy stra
tegists. They believe it essential In ths formu
lation of a national military policy, - It
was learned tonight, to provide against
the eventuality of an assault upon the
doctrine by either an Asiatic or a Euro
pean power, or even by an alliance of
two such powers, which might hurl
forces simultaneously at the Atlantio and
Paclflo coasts.
Vlttmate Aim of Plast.
A nsvy equal In strength to those of
sny two world powers, except Great
Britain, and an army prepared to fight
for the Integrity of the pan-American
idea anywhere in pan-America, is the
ultimate aim of the plan of the military
experts.
Ten years Is the time the navy general
board believes the United States has in
which to prepare for a readjustment of
world forces which follow the European
war. In setting 1925 as the time when
the United States navy should equal any
afloat which means reaching the two
power standard of the British navy the
board estimated that much time would
elapse before the shock of the present
war passed sufficiently to permit any of
the belligerents to look to South and
Central America for colonial development
or trade aggression.
Plans. of the army war college would
be consummated In six years. The army
officers take the position that the
United States must have sufficient
troops and troop ships to land foroes In
any threatened pan-American country to
meet an Invader.
roller Aaatressive Oae.
All these preparations, It is now known,
have been presented by strategists to
the administration as essential to support
the Monroe doctrine, so thst the United
States may be able to act alone. If neces
sary, to preserve Its ideal of no entan
gling alliances. Such Ideals, ths military
students have stated, impose new dutina
on the United States duties that require
something more than a policy of mere
passive resistance.
While the administrative branch of the.
government has submitted to eoimu n.
definite plan which contemplates an In
creased expenditure of more than $1,000,000
on the military and naval establishments
n the next six years, all other aarenclcs
of tho government are acting to unify
and harmonize the Pan-American nations.
To students of diplomacy the Pan-American
declaration of President Wilson In
his opening address to congress; the
declarations for Pan-American llnttv
made to the Pan-American Scientific con
gress are by Secretary Lansing and the
general effort for unity of all the Ameri
cans on a basis of friendship and equality.
take on added significance when con
sidered in connections with the admini
stration's preparedness plans.
A Mgalflrnnt Factor.
The recent announcement that the am
bassador from Argentine, Braill and
Chile has ben selected by the United
States to represent it on the commissions
provided by the peace Investigation
treaties with France, Great Britain and
Italy Is regarded as one of the slgniricent
factors in this connection.
Significance Also is seen In the dis
closure that an effort to postpone the
Pan-Amcrlcan congress on the ground
that sufficient time had not been given
to prepare an adequate scientific program
was met by the statement that the United
States was lnsilently desirous of taking
prompt stops to further the spirit of Pan-
American accord, confidently, sympathy
and mutuality. South American capitals
uniformly report that the congress Is re
garded there as more political than
scientific and that approbation of tho
sentiment of Pan-American unity It freely
expressed.
Information Not Hevealed.
What confidential information the army
war college and ths navy general board
may have gathered concerning the Inten
tions of any certain power or powers Is
not being revealed; but there are certain
matters of general knowledge which are
known to have entered Into the study of
possibilities upon which the theory of a
two-power attack upon the Monroe doc
trine was based.
With the military problem agreed upon
and defined the two boards of strategists
were asked what. In their opinion, would
constitute sdequate national defense.
Their answer was to build a two-power
navy and organise a federal army of
sufficient slxe so that a portion of it
could be used in any southern country
sgalnat a foreign Invader without impair
the safety of the United . States Itself.
Board's Recommendations.
To accomplish this the general board
then recommended for the navy:
1. Authorisation In Itl-1T of SJOOOOOOno
In new ship, as axatnat a total Invest
ment in nentlng equipment now afloat
during ths hut thirty vein of 1jS9 iss Ml

Roberts Says Question Whether It
Reverts to Europe depends "
Upon American Merchants.
BUSINESS IS Q ROWING FAST
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3. Whether
the foreign trade of South America
reverts to European markets after
the war, will depend largely upon the
Interest shown now by American in
vestors, said George B. Roberts of
the National City bank of New York,
in a paper be read today before a
sub-division of the Pan-American
Scientific congress, lie said that for
the last six months South American
countries had imported more heavily
from the United States.
"The exports of South America have
not fallen off as much as the Imports,"
he sdded. "and are coming more largely
to tho United States than, heretofore.
This applies particularly to coffee, coooa,
hides and wool."
Mr. Roberts explained that ths finan
cial crisis In a number of the South
American countries at the time the Euro
pean war began was largely responsible
for ths difficulties of business men', in
those countries. The wtaWfircvented
them from rocelvfna; the financial assist
ance they perhaps would hare received,
especially in Argentine and Brasll.
(tegular Trade In terra pted.
"But, as It was," he said, "all tho
countries of South America suffered by
ths ourtailment of credits to which they
were accustomed, 'the Interruption of
regular trade and the stoppage of con
struction work. Importations have been
largely reduced In all lines.
"South America's trade with Germany
practically has ceased, and importations
from all countries except the United
States have been largely reduced. It Is
probable that a fair share of ths new
trade diverted to this country by the war
will be permanent. Much depends upon
the interest taken by tho United States
In the development of South American
enterprises. Trade will bs created by in
vestments in South America."
Drraa Endorses Laaalna's Plan.
William J. Bryan has declared In favor
of the administration's recent suggestion
for a Panamerlcan convention for arbi
tration of boundary disputes.
'This evolution of ths Monroe doc
trine," Mir. Bryan said, "enforced by the
United States alone into a Panamerlcan
lam, supported by all the American ree
publics Jointly, will not only Insure
solidarity of sentiment, but wilt by the
union of their strength, lessen ths ex
penditures necessary for their protection
from possible attempts at Invasion."
Mr. Bryan also advocated the adoption
of his proposal, while secretary of state.

General Ivanoff Gains Gronnd
as
Result of Heavy Fighting
on Southern Flank.
TWO OFFENSIVE ACTIONS CLASH
LONDON, Jan. 3. The latest dis
patches from the southern extremity
of the Russian front indicate that
heavy fighting is continuing, with
the Russian army of General Ivan
off gaining ground.
One correspondent reports that
these operations began with an of
fensive movement on the part of the
Austrians, designated to straighten
their line, and that after repulsing
the attack, the Russians assumed the
Initiative. It Is evident that the Rus
sian advance has now extended a
considerable distance beyond the
Stripa river.
In other dispatches It is asserted that
two great offensive actions clashed, ths
Russians having advanced as a threat
against the Teutons In their Balkan oper
ations, while the Austrians and Germans
felt the necessity of improving their posi
tions against ths attack expected from
Uenersi Ivanoff early in ths spring.
