Annual Meeting of Board Lv Held
at Court House Many Matters
Considered.
VOTE DOWN N. M. D.
A. APPROPRIATION
County Officials Are Appointed Bids
for County Printing
is Let.
A. E. Rako, county commissioner
from the first district, was this
morning re-elected chairman of the
board of county commissioners at the
annual meeting of that body. J. C.
Thompson, Blackduck, of the fifth
district, was chosen vice-chairman.
Hayes Against Fund.
The county board refused to ap
propriate $250 to the Northern Min
nesota Development association to
carry on the work of that organiza
tion for the next year. Commission
ers Rako, Thompson, Clementson and
Lennon voted in favor of the appro
priation and Commissioner Hayes op
posed it. It is necessary for a un
animous vote to pass the appropria
tion.
Called Private Enterprise.
Commissioner Hayes opposed the
appropriation, claiming that as far
as the county was concerned the
Northern Minnesota Development as
sociation was a private association
and for private good. Other com
missioners held that the association
was doing much good for the county
and Northern Minnesota and that it
was one of the few ways in which to
advertise the county.
^Otterstad Appointed.
Nels Otterstad was appointed by
the commissioners as state land ap
praiser. Henry Pfund was named
supervisor of assessors. J. H. Wynne
was named as janitor of the court
house and J. H. McGhee was named
assistant superintendent of schools.

printing was allowed to the Sen
tinel with $1,500 bonds. All legal
papers in the county will print the

missioners. JUDGE GROWELL IS

DOMESTIC
New York, Jan. 4.Prosperity is
written in gold across this country's
financial record in 1915. Uncle Sam
has almost half a billion dollars more
of foreign gold than he had a year
ago. American merchants have sold
more goods abroad than ever before.
The greatest external loan in history.,
the Anglo-French loan, was floated
in 1915. The market value of Am
erican securities appreciated some
thing like two billion dollars in the
twelve months. National banks have
bigger deposits and larger reserves
than at any time since this country
was founded. A wave of specula
tion swept the country and permitted
the New York stock exchange to close
1915 with a boom as explosively
bright as the year's beginning was
dull. Unsmirched by the failure of
a single member, the 1915 record of
the New York exchange is crowded
with stories of newly made million
aires and sprinkled with fifty-million
share trading days.
160,000,000 Shares Traded.
More than 160,000,000 shares of
stocks were traded in during the year,
representing an aggregate value of
more than fourteen billion dollars,
and nearly nine hundred millions
worth of bonds. In 1914, only 48,-
031,833 shares changed hands, rep
resenting less than four billion dol
lars, and the bond business was only
$440,438,600. The war caused the
stock exchange to close four months
in 1914, which partly explains the
comparatively small business. From
the dark, uncertain days of early Jan
uary, 1915, with minimum prices and
other war restrictions, business in
the world's biggest stock market
gradually developed until million
share trading days became almost
common. There were fifty of these
million share days in 1915, only two
in 1914, none in 1913 and 11 in
1911. There were fifty in 1909. In
January, 1915, only about four mil
lion shares were dealt inin October
almost thirty million shares changed
hands. Many days in the latter part
of the year were almost million share
days that is, when business ran well
over nine hundred thousand shares.
Minimum prices were abolished "April
and from then on the market
boomed.
Spectacular Fireworks.
The war babies and war bride
stocks of companies manufacturing
war supplies for the belligerent coun
tries furnished more spectacular fire
works in 1915 than Wall Street has
witnessed since 1901, when J. J. Hill
and E. H. Harriman sent the market
into convulsions by their fight to buy
control of the Northern Pacific rail
road in the open market. Bethle

International And Domestic
Financial Review For 1915
By J. W. T. MASON
WRITTEN FOR THE UNITED PRESS
THE CUB
REPORTER
INTERNATIONAL
New York, Jan. 4.At the close
of 1915 the war has cost more than
twenty-six billion dollars, exceeding
by five hundred million the total na
tional debts of the six principal bel
ligerent powers when the conflict be
gan. With the exception of about
five million raised in the United
Kingdom by taxation, practically all
the expenses of the war have been
met by borrowed money. The end of
1915, therefore, finds the fighting na
tions saddled with double the debt
they had accumulated in all the cen
turies preceding the outbreak of the
war.
Cost ^85,000,000 Daily.
In the early days of the war the
most liberal estimate of its cost, in
cluding the destruction of property
and the economic losses caused by
casualties, was fifty million dollars
per day. The actual expenses now,
exclusive of economic and property
losses, is eighty-five million per
day. Of this amount the quadruple
entente is paying two-thirds and the
Teutonic allies one-third. If the war
continues through the winter the cost
will probably rise to a hundred mil
lion per day. The interest for war
loans which the war has already im
posed on Europe's future generations
is about a billion, two hundred mil
lion per year. Every week the war
lasts fixes an additional annual in
terest burden on the belligerents of
twenty-five million.
Taxation Colossal.
Colossal taxaation will have to be
imposed on the soldiers when they
return home after peace is declared.
The belligerents will be bowed be
neath the burdens of the war debts.
The Germans for a time this year be
lieved it might be possible for them
to evade their cost of the conflict by
compelling the quadruple entente
powers to pay a full indemnity. Dr.
Helfferich, the German minister of
finance, made this statement in the
Reichstag last August. But as the
year's fighting continued with con
stantly increasing ^expenditures, the
German government changed its mind
about the possibility of any belliger- I
ent*being" abie i 6^^
financial net. Dr. Helfferich, there
fore, announced a fortnight ago that
although Germany might collect an
indemnity, yet the war would impose
"a colossal burden" of new taxes on

CITIZENS WANT
FIRE WHISTLE
Protest is Made at City Council Meet-
ing Against New System of Not
Notifying Citizens.
Several Bemidji citizens have
lodged a protest against not blowing
the fire whistle when there is a fire,
according to Alderman C. Foucault,
at the meeting of the city council last
evening.
Under the new fire alarm system
which will be completely installed to
day, the fire whistle will not blow,
as each fireman will be notified of the
fire individually. One of the rea
sons for securing the new alarm sys
tem, it was pointed out at the coun
cil meeting last evening, was not to
let the public know where the fire
is so that crowds will not interfere
with the work of the firemen.
Alderman Foucault told the coun
cil members that the complaint was
lodged by men wbii.had business down
town and who desired to be notified
if there was a fire in the down town
district.
No action was taken by the city
council in the matter.
The only action taken by the city
council last evening at the meeting
was the regular allowing of the bills.
Alderman Lycan, Ervin, Smart and
Moberg were not present at the meet
ing.
Alderman Lahr presided at the
meeting.

COUNTY OFFICIALS
RESTRAINED FROM
BUYING BUILDING
Judge C. W. Stanton Issues Order
Against Clearwater County
Officials.
CIEARBR00K CITIZENS
ASK FOR INJUNCTION
School Building Was to Be Accepted
Today by-pounty for Court
House Purposes.
Judge C. W. Stanton has filed a
temporary restraining order against
the county commissioners of Clear
water county restraining them from
buying the Independent school
building at Bagley to be used as a
court house. A hearing will be
heard in the matter Jan. 13.
Injunction Requested.
A permanent injunction has been
requested by several residents of
Clearbrook who are represented by
Attorney Evesoh of that village.
The county commissioners at a re
cent meeting offered the school dis
trict $10,000 for the building in Bag
ley, to be used as a court house. At
an election it was decided by the
school district to sell the building as
a new school will be constructed in
the near future.
Old Building Inadequate.
The county commissioners were to
have accepted the. school district's
propositioa and the exchange made
today.
The Clearwater county court house
is at present located in a wooden
building in Bagley. The building is
very inadequate and many of the
county officers have not been able to
find room in the building for of
fices. All the county records are in
danger of fire as the vault space is
limited.
The action taken by the county
commissioners in securing the school
building was believed by many to
have been the best remedy for the
situation and would give the county
an excellent court house.

ment this afternoon states that 53
per cent of the unmarried youths and
men of military age in England volun
teered during the recent Derby re

that will be introduced in Parliament
this week.
Single men between the ages of 23
and 26, inclusive, enlisted in the
Derby campaign have been called to
