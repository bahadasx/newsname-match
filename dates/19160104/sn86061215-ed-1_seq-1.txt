%£Tension, However, is Not
fv
Tension Not Lessened.
While American officials are keep
ing their minds open until they have
all the facts in the Persia case official
ly and know whether Americans were
endangered in the sinking of the Glen
gyle," the gravity of the situation is
not minimized, and the declaration of
Baron Zwledinek, the Austrian charge,
that he was confident the final explan
ation woudl be satisfactory has not lesr
sened the tension.
One new fact developed today in the
Persia case. The American consul at
Alexandria reported that the ship car
ried one 4.7 inch gun but did not state
where the gun was mounted. This may
become a factor In the case. The
Hague convention, however, provides
that a merchant ship may carry a gun
mounted on the stern for purposes of
defense without being considered an
armed ship.
The official view here is that the
question of whether a gun was mount
ed on the Persia will depend entirely
on where It was placed. If mounted
forward, officials realize the Austrian
government could contend the Persia
was armed for destruction of submar
ines and had instruct^ .s to ram or
destroy the suhmersibles. The dispo
sition Is not to assign the Incident of
the gun to a place in consideration of
the case until all facts are known.
Officials consider that the Austrian
submarine campaign in the Mediter
ranean has brought on just such a
crisis as did the German submarine
campaign in the declared war zone
around the British isles. Coming close
on the conciliatory assurances in Aus
tria's Ancona note, the continued sub
marine activity, principally around the
entrance to the Suez canal, has alarm
ed and amazed American officials, who
have grave apprehensions over the de
velopments of the next few days.
To Ask Information.
Secretary Lansing announced he
had Instructed Ambassador Penfield at
Vienna to ask the Austrian govern*
ment for any information which might
establish the nationality of the sub*
marine which Is said to have sunk the
Persia and which would develop the
facts in the case.
Secretary Lansing also said that
some action would be taken to formal
ly notify Turkey and Bulgaria of the
attitude of the United- States toward
submarine warfare so that all the cen
tral power belligerents operating in
the Mediterranean might'not be unin
formed.
Mr. Lansing was asked today what
the attitude of the state department
would be if Investigation developed
that Austrian submarines in the Medi-

PRESSED WITH LATEST SUB
MARINE WARFARE
Paris, Jan. 3.—Germany's war on In
offensive passengers' continues, "dis
spite the protests of the United States
and the injunctions of the cabinet at
Washington," says the Temps In an
editorial discussing the sinking of the
British steamer Persia.
"Notes continue to accumulate with
out result and the Austro-Germans go
on with drownings and assassinations.
There is, however, a .limit to the
patience of the American government.
"Public sentiment in the United
States is in favor cf the allies and its
sincerity is indicated by the immense
amount of supplies sent to the Bel
gians, the invaded regions of France
and to the Serbians. American chari
ty gives unceasingly enormous sums.
To this active sympathy there is added
growing anger against the authors of
so many misdeeds. The destruction of
the Persia without warning will com
plete this indignation." ..
ITALY IS IMPRESSED.
Rome, Jan. 3.—The sinking of the
Persia has made a profound impres
sion in Italy, which is reflected in the
the press.
"This new crime is a grievous of
fense against civilization," says the
Giornale D'ltalia, "especially as it
comes almost at the time of the Aus
trian note to America, with its pro
fession of humanitarian principles."
The Trlbuna recalls the facts that
during the negotiations with the Unit
ed States concerning the Lusitania,
Germans sank the Arabic, just as now,
with the Austro-Amerlcan exchanges
over the Ancona in progress, the Per
sia has been destroyed.

FORD PARTY THE
TO PISS
BELLIGERENT GOVERNMENT TO
ALLOW MEMBERS TO GO BY
TRAIN TO THE HAGUE.
Copenhagen, Jan. 3.—The German
government has granted the Ford
peace expedition permission to travel
to The Hague through Germany by
special train. The party will leave
Copenhagen next Friday.
The final arrangements for the trip
were made through the German con
sulate at Copenhagen, who after con
sulation with Berlin, announced that
his government was willing for the
mission to proceed through German
territory. This privilege was granted
despite the refusal of the American
state department to extend the pass
ports of the members of the party to
cover a belligerent country.
The conditions under which the
Americans will travel are strict. Their
train will be sealed, everyone being
locked within. No one will be permit
ted to touch German soil during Ihe
journey. The members of the mis
sion will not be permitted to carry
written, printed or typewritten papers.
The concealment of any paper, even
of an innocent character, will result
in complications for the entire party.
Other things that the party must
abandon before reaching German ter
ritory are cameras, postcards, opera
glasses and gold coin. Most of the
baggage of the expedition will be
shipped back to the United States
from Copenhagen.
It is announced that the expedition
will disband at The Hague on Jan. 12,
most of the members returning home
from Rotterdam on that day.
That the peace expedition will be
able to travel through a belligerent
country, even though its journey is un
der special guard with the members
of the party almost as prisoners, Is
regarded in Europe as the most pie
turesque feature that this unique pro
ject has developed.
For days the managers of the party
were perplexed as to how they could
reach The Hague, which previousl
had been selected as the partys ult
mate goal. The United States govern
ment had refused to extend the pass
ports of the delegates so as to enable
them to travel through Germany, al
though an appeal had been made to
Minister Morris at Stockholm and to
Minister Egan at Copenhagen to this
end. Definite word came from Wash
ington, however, it is declared, that
the peace party must be kept out of
warring countries, as its presence In
them might entail complications.
Finally, Gaston Plantiff, Mr. Ford's
representative, went to the. Gertoan
minister and consul in Copenhagen,
offering to pay $50,000 for a special
train and explaining that the party
did not desire to remain on German
soil. The request was grants', pro
vided the peacemakers subject them
selves to the strictest military law.
It Is understood that the railroad re
fused to accept any pay for the trip
in addition to the regular charge in
such cases.
The announcement that the party
will disband at The Hague on January
12 is explained as meaning only that
those who are not selected for places
on thf permanent peace board will

Davenport, Jan. 8.—The first step
in the fight of the Iowa Liquor Deal
ers' association to teBt the validity of
the repeal of the mulct la* making
Iowa dry, was taken this morning
when the saloon of John Hill in Daven
port was opened at 7 o'clock. A crowd
of men gathered in the place and
liquor is said to have been sold. About
7:30 o'cloek two special agents from
the attorney general's office entered
the saloon, told the proprietor and
bartenddta to close up. The crowd was
put out of the place .and a conference
followed. V"
The special agents are~worklng un
der the direction of Attorney General
Cosson of Iowa, who is to conduct
the fight for the state. ^y are C.
A. Brunson and G. B. Bidwell. John
Hill, the proprietor of the saloon two
bartenders, Louis Wendel and E. A.
Geiseker, and a porter, Henry Nlssen,
were placed under arrest by the spec
ial officers and turned over to Sheriff
Eckhart.
Later John Schnack and J. J. Naven,
two other saloonkeepers, who had
opened their places, were arrested. All
were released on their promise to ap
pear. It is probable that the criminal
action against the men will be drop
ped and injunction suits will be startr
ed at once in the district court and the
cases will be brought up for trial im
mediately.
Attorney General Cosson stated to
day that when he cams to Davenport
it was under the impression that the
saloonkeepers were to open in defiance
of the law. Had he known that only
three were opening and that merely
for the purpose of testing the validity
of the repeal of the mulct law, no ar
rests would have been made, but the
matter would have been taken up im
mediately by injunction.
Hill, Schnack and Naven were chos
en by the Liquor Dealers association
as the ones to test the law.
HEAVY SHOES FOR ARMY

is urged.
The inspector general recommends
the abandonment of the annual test
ride for officers as having "failed to
accomplish any good purpose," and
that officers over forty-five years of
age be excused from annual obstacle

In general the report finds the regu-

Chicago, Jan. S.—A plan to mobilise
the entire military strength of Illi
nois, Iowa, Indiana and Wisconsin,
25,000 men, comprising one full divi
sion, has taken Frank S. Dickson, ad
jutant general of the Illinois national
guard, to Washington for a conference
with United States military officials, it
waa announced here today.
The Illinois military head is to con
fer with Senator George E. Chamber
lain of Oregon who Is to Introduce
in congress a bill providing for the
maneuvers of not less than one full
division of militia for the purpose of
giving experience to army officers in
handling large bodies of troops. An
effort is to be diade to have Camp Lo
gan, adjacent to Chicago, chosen as
the training ground.
On a war footing the Illinois militia
would provide virtually a full army
division but as it is recruited only' on
a peace footing. It has only 8,000 men
in Its eight regiments of Infantry, one
of artillery, one of cavalry and a com
pany each of engineers and signal
service men.
By including with the Illinois
guardsmen the militia of Iowa, Indi
ana and Wisconsin, the full number
of soldiers for an army division could
be obtained.

80UTH AMERICAN COMMERCB
MAY REVERT TO EUROPE.
Washington, D. C., Jan. 3.—Whether
the foreign trade of South America re
verts to European markets after the
war will depend largely on the inter
est shown now by American investors,
said George E. Roberts1 of the National
City bank of New York, in a paper to
day before a sub-division of the Pan
American scientific congress. He
said that for the last six months
South American countries had import
ed more heavily from the United
States.'
"The exports of South America have
not fallen off as much as the ImportB,"
he added, "and are coming more large
ly to the United States than hereto
fore. This applies particularly to cof
fee, cocoa, hides and wool."
Mr. Roberts explained that the fin
ancial -":nsis in a number of the South
Arae countries at the time the
Europ ...i war begun, was largely re
sponsible for the difficulties of busi
ness men in those countries. The
war prevented them from receiving
the financial assistance they perhaps
would have received especially in
