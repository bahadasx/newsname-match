The Farmer Facing a Crisis
William Ilirth
Farmers' Week is in full blast to
day, bigger and better than ever. Ses
sions began at S:30 this morning and
there has been something going on
every minute of the time since, with
the exception of an hour and a half
at the noon period. In fact, there
have been several somethings going
on at the same time.
"It's equal to a twwity-fotir ring
circus." said a farmer who is attend
ing Farmers' Week for the first time.
"If a person could only see all of
the twenty-four rings at the same
Mine, lie could get a year's education
111 a week. I only wish I bad twenty
four pairs of ears and eyes and could
be at as many places at the same
time.
"There's something for every tpe
of fanner. I sometimes say there are
three types the tired, the retired and
the rubber-tired. The farmer who's
tired of his old methods and hasn't
made a success, can find new inspira
tion here; the retired farmer van
learn how to better operate his farm
at a distance, and Ihe rubber-tired
farmer who has the means to invest
in automobiles and latest machinery
of all kinds gets imbued with the
newest ideas here."
Kiifht Associiiliinis JIcl.
The suggestion of a twenty-four ring
circus wasn't far from wrong. Dur
ing every hour of the day, from four
to nine sessions of the Farmers' Short
Course in Agriculture were going on,
and the greater part of the time there
have been sessions of eacli of the
eight state associations.
Kegistration began at the State
Hoard of Agriculture booth this morn
ing. The fact that it is somewhat
lighter than this time last year, W.
L. Nelson, assistant secretary, thinks
is the result of putting r armers
Week a week earlier.
Th.. fact that schools begins on
Tuesday probably will cause many
farmers to come in a day later than
they otherwise would have done," said
Mr. Nelson. "It is hard to forecast
what the registration will bo by the
end of the week. A greater number
may attend than last year."
One of the new features on this
year's program is a short course for
rural pastors. Its sessions began this
morning with lectures by I. I-- Ber
nard, f ssistant professor of Sociology.
A. W. Taylor of the Missouri Bible
College and S. D. Gromer, assistant
professor of rural economic. While
Hie course is scheduled as being for
rural pastors, it is really a confer
ence for rural church workers of all
kinds ajid an effort is being made to
interest others than pastors in the
meetings.
Women Xol Xeglccled.
The short course program this morn
ing also included practically every
pha-e of agricultural endeavor. The
women's Interests were particularly
well looked after with home economics
demonstrations by Miss Louise Stan
ley. .Miss Hildegard Kneeland and
Miss Bab Bell.
This afternoon many of the visitors
witit on a special excursion to the
state serum plant, leaving the Wabash
depot at 1:45 pnd returning at 4
o'clock.

er I armers- vicck speaker, in .-'i. ; lormer president ot tlie istate ISoard of , Ictie affairs in lull.

Marshall Jud";e Will Be on
Bench in Railroad and
Cigarette Trials.
Tomorrow Judge David II. Harris
will be replaced by Judge Samuel Da

Boone County Circuit Court. Judge
I Harris is disqualified from hearing
the case of William A. Sampson
against the M. K. & T. Railway Com-
pany. becau

plaintiff.
While Judge Davis is in Columbia
he will hear the injunction suit
brought by seven Columbia merchants
to prohibit the enforcement of the anti-cigarette
ordinance passed in Octo
ber. Judge Harris is disqualified
from hearing this case because he is
related to one of the petitioners.
Although the cigarette case is
docketed for tomorrow, it is hardly
probable that it will be heard then. I
The railroad case will likely take up
the entire day. George P. Starrett,
city attorney, will probabli ask for a
postponement until Saturday, al
though Boyle G. Clark, attorney for
tho merchants, wants the trial before
then. Judge Davis will set the date
tomorrow.

i enjoying a leisure this afternoon that

. was denied him during the week of
strenuous acthity that preceded the
new year. The books are not balanced
! yet. but he estimated the total taxes
collected as three or four thousand
dollars short of last year's collections.
"And I can't account for it," lie
said, anticipating the inevitable ipiery.
"It is a problem for the sociology de
partment or is it the economics de
partment?"' The unpaid taxes amount to 25 per
cent of the total, compared with 1.".
per cent last year.
Today was the last day of grace for
delimiuents. absoultely, said Mr.
Jacobs. It wasn't so much giMierosity
as the fact that many had their af
fairs in such a tangled condition that
another day was necessary to straight-
I ,. things out. that caused the post-
iponement of the delinquent tax.

collections are about the same as last
year and will not require the services
of the economist or sociologist to ex
plain any unusual conditions. Dur

bringing the collections for the year
to about 85 per cent of the total.
