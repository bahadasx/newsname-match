Mr. McNeely sailed from Now

The Persia was a steamer of 7,974
tons gross. She was owned by the

Company, of London. She

serve as consul, has given an unusual
notoriety to this latest sea tragedy

of friends and relatives in North f

ter will be very largely determined 1
by whether or not American lives (
were placed in wanton jeopardy. Suf- '
fieient information upon which to act ?
may not be placed before the De-; '
partment under several days. If Mr-; I
N'eely has escaped, his testimony will I
be regarded as of utmost worth.
McNeely was in a most optimistic |
frame of mind before leaving Wash- '
ington on the dangers of submarines. ,
lie remarked that if the ship he in- i (
tended going on should be attacked. |
he would not be left in the water if j
there was anything around to float
on. He told the Observer correspon-i
dent ne 11111 not expect any trounie
and that he believed the greater dan-!
ger of such attacks had passed.
He was happy over his appoint-;
tuent as consul and looked forward j
to seeing the life along the Mediterranean
and in the old countries. His
appointment had come after a long
wait. He passed his examination in
the fail of 1904 with an excellent
grade. There was no suitable vacancy
at that time and he continued in
his law practice.
Assistance was given him by Senators
Overman and Simmons and
Representative Page in getting admission
to the school and in receiving
his appointment which was made j
October 18. 1915.
McNeely is widely known in North |
Carolina, being a student at the IJni-i

to practice law. The next year he
was chosen a member of the House
of Representatives from Union county,
and subsequently he was called
upon to become Senator, representing
Union, Stanley and Davidson coun-j
ties.
In college he was recognized for j
his love of oratory and for his stu- i ,
dious habits. He is 32 years of age.

Innl Blow Struck by Vote of the
People in September.
Dry Now.
Columbia, January 1.?The queson
of the abolition of the whiskey
afllc in South Carolina began to be
gitated soon after the redemption
f the State under Gen. Hampton in
876, but this early agitation was
ji uirsti option in a few scattered
ounties. Special acts of the General
ssembly were introduced and pass.1
permitting "wet" and "dry" elecions
for Anderson, Orangeburg,
aurens and other counties. Tlie con^st
between the prohibitionists and
tense men in some of these counles
was heated. In none of them
hich succeed in voting out the liI'usod
saloons was prohibition snctssfullj
enforced In those days 1
nd after a few years most of them
eta rued to the liceried saloon sysMll.
In the Legislature of 180o a bill
ir statewide prohibition, introdued
by Into L. 1). Child- , of K;"hland
nunty developed great strength
ml narrowly tailed of passage. This
as the period of inters-' division
etween the "Tilliuanites" and the
anti-Tillirantics" and .>oth tactions
tcluded numbers of men on both
ides of the liquor question. Neither
ictions, as such, was willing to take
stand on either side of the question,
it 1892 when the contest for govrnor
was between B. R Tillman
nd John C. Sheppard, the State
lemocratic executive eommitte consider
that in each precinct a seprate
box shouid be placed in which
te people at the primary election
tight vote as between prohibition
nd licensed saloons. The total vote
ist for governor at this election was
little less than 88.000, and the vote
n the whiskey question totaled a
rue more than 70,000. the prohibiionists
won in the referendum by aout
10,000, the vote for license belg
about ."10,000, and that for proibition
about 40,000. When the reult
became known it was taken for
ranted that the Legislature would
naot the Childs bill or one similar
[) if. Mr. Childs did not return to
Ire Legislature and the new prohlbiion
bill was introduced in the house
y Mr. Roper, when the Legislature
let in November. The T'.llmanites
r "Reformers" had overwhelming
lajorities in both houses. The leadrs
of their faction were afraid of
rohibition. They apprehended that
might enacted, cause an increase
f taxation and in other ways divide
he Tillman forces. The Roper bill 2'
rag, however, promptly passed by V
in- aouse. in ine senate a number of
ills bearing on the whiskey traffic
rere introduced and at one time it
eemed as though the subject would
io so confused in that body that no
egislation would result. Governor
'iliman already had taken the posiiou
that the profits of the saloons,
liich hitherto had gone entirely
ito the town treasuries, should
o divided with the counties po
'ie rural section hight share them,
larlboro county at thisi Cute was dry
ith the counties, so that the rural
notions might share in tuena. Marl.ii'o
county at this time was dry
