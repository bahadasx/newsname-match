ALLIES WORRIED
AT THE ACTIVITY
OFENEMIES'SUBS
London, Jan. 3, 10:19 p. m. (De
layed.) The continuance of subma
rine activity in the Mediterranean
which was emphasized today by the
news of sinking of the valuable British
steamer Glengyle, with the loss of 10
lives, has produced a profound impres
sion in all the entente capitals. There
is an insistent demand from the pub
lic for vigorous measures against the
underseas commerce raiders, but the
problem is no easy one for the Anglo
French naval staff.
The Anglo-French press expresses
the opinion that some sort of policing
of several sections of the intricate
Mediterranean coasts and archiepela
goes is necessary. Presumably the oc
cupation recently by entente forces of
the island of Castelorizo, off the south
coast of Asia Minor, was one step in
the scheme to provide a more thorough
control of the regions where subma
rine bases are supposed to exist.
Expecting Serious Clash.
The opinion is expressed here that
the central powers are likely to plead
as justification for the reported fail
ure to give warning to Mediterranean
liners, that the boats frequently have
carried a heavy gun for defensive pur
poses. There seems to be a general
impression in the entente capitals that
the loss of American life as a result
of the British ship Persia must inevi-j
tably result in a serious clash between
the central allies and the United
States.
Appointed Receiver of Factory.
New York, Jan. 4. William H. Cov
erdale and George Wr. Morgan were to

ATTACK ON POLICY
FAILS TO MATURE
IN FIRST SESSION
BAT IN CONGRESS.
Senate: Adjourned out of re
spect to the memory of the late
Jttstlce Lamar until noon tomor
row. An expected attack on the
administration's foreign policy
thus failed to materialize.
House: Secretary .M e A doo ask
ed rush appropriation of $100,000
for rural sanitation and titrli ting
typhoid and pellagra.
The administration rural credits
bill introduced.
.Naval affairs committee ar
ranged to beg-in public hearing
tomorrow.
Representative Campbell of
Kansas introduced a resolution
for creation of an international
federation of nations to preserve
international law.
Washington, D. C, Jan. 4. An ex
pected attack on the administration's
foreign policy and its course in the
submarine crisis, failed to material
ize in the senate today when that body,
after being in session less than ten
minutes, adjourned until noon tomor
row. The reason assigned to the sudden
adjournment by leaders on both sides
was that several senators who had
expected to have business to present,
did not have it ready. The motion on
which the senate adjourned, however,
was in observance of the death of
Justice Lamar of the supreme court.
Chairman Stone of the foreign rela
tion committee, in conference with
President Wilson over the submarine
crisis earlier in the day told the pres
ident he had heard intimation that
some senators were going to assail
the administration's course, and that
some others were going to attack the
Mexican policy. ,

DISTURBS TOKIO
Tokio, Dec. 10, (Correspondence.)
Great anxiety is felt at Tokio con
cerning the fate of the cargo boat Sen
Ju Maru of the Tatsuma Steamship
company, which has not been heard of
since she left Oran for Port Said Nov.
!24. The crew numbers 50. The for
eign office has instituted inquiries for
the vessel but the families of the men
are fearing that she may have been
sunk by a submarine in the Mediter

ed negotiations with Spain for the re
lease of the officers and crew, 48 in all,
of the steamer lasakunl Maru, which
was torpedoed last month by a Ger
man submarine in the Mediterranean.
It appears that the men are in the
hands of the Spanish authorities in
Morocco where they took refuge after
the steamer had been attacked.

DISASTER OF
PERSIA TOLD

STORY CORROBORATED
Tragedy as Described by
Charles Grant Coincides
With Dispatches.
Alexandria, Egypt, Jan. 4 (via Lon
don, 10:30 a. m.) Charles Grant of
Boston, one of the two Americans
known to have been on board the
British steamship Persia when she
was torpedoed in the Mediterranean
last Thursday, has arrived in Alex
andria. Mr. Grant, so far as is known,
ia the only American from whom can
come the story of the Persia's sink
ing. He gave to the Associated Press
today the most detailed account yet
received of the disaster:
"I was in the dining saloon of the
Persia at 1:05 p. m.," he said. "I had
Just finished my soup and the steward
was asking what I would take for
my second course when a terrific ex
plosion occurred.
'o Panic on Board.
"The saloon became filled with
smoke, broken glass and steam from
the boiler, which appearad to have
burst. There was no panic on board.
We went on deck as though we were
at drill and reported at the lifeboats
on the starboard side, as the vessel
had listed to port. I clung to the rail
ing. The last thing done was to tie
on Captain SpTickley's life belt.- -
"As the vessel was then listing so
badly that It was impossible to launch
the starboard boats, I slid down the
starboard rail into the water. I got
caught in a rope which pulled off a
shoe, but I broke loose and climbed
on some floating wreckage, to which
I clung.
Sank in Five Minutes.
"The last I saw of the Persia she
had her bow in the air, five minutes
after the explosion.
"After floating about on the wreck
age until 4 o'clock in the morning I
saw five boats. I was pulled into one
of them. We rowed about, looking
for other stragglers.
"The boats became overloaded and
the occupants were redistributed.
Four boats were tied together by
their painters and the fifth followed
some distance away.
American Consul 'ot Seen.
"My boat left the others in order
to search the more frequented steam
ship channels for help. We rowed
for three hours. Then we saw a
cruiser and called out, 'We are Eng
lish.' We explained that we were sur
vivors of the Persia and gave direc
tions to the cruiser as to where the
other boats were. They were soon
found and the occupants taken off
Immediately by the English sailors.
"Robert McNeely, American consul
at Aden, sat at the same table with
me on the voyage. He was not seen,
probably because his cabin was on
the port side.
"It was a horrible scene. The wa
ter was as black as ink. Some pas
sengers were screaming, others were
calling out good-bye. Those in one
boat sang hymns."
Storm Affects fables.
New York, Jan. 4. Trans-Atlantic

tion of Victoriano Huerta, former pro
visional president of Mexico, who is
seriously ill at his home here, was re
ported unchanged early today after an
operation for gall stones Saturday. A
second operation to remove a quantity
of fluid from the intestinal tract was
performed late yesterday. The patient
appeared much relieved by the opera
tion. Guards, placed about the Huerta
home after his removal from Fort

authorities at San Antonio, Texas.
BRITISH CABINET
OFFICER RESIGNS
London, Jan. 4, (2 a. m.) It again
becomes evident that the cabinet
crisis is far from ended. The only
definite point is that Sir John Simon,
secretary of state for home affairs,
has resigned. He had a prolonged in
terview with Premier Asquith yester
day. The premier did his utmost to
induce Sir John to remain in the
cabinet, but without avail, and it is
almost certain that the home secre
tary's resignation will be officially an
nounced on the reassembling of par
liament. The position of Reginald McKenna,
chanceller of the exchequer,, and
Walter Runciman, president of the
board of trade, is still undecided.

ing the situation created by the
submarine campaign in the Med
terranean. The president and Sec
retary of State Lansing are tak
ing every means possible to ob
tain the exact facts and will act
as soon as the information is ob
tained, it was announced In a
statement issued by the president's
secretary.
Particulars regarding the sink
ing of the Peninsular and Orien
tal steamer Geelong are still lack
ing, except that it is known that
there was no loss of life when she
went down.
Under the Earl of Derby's plan
for British recruiting 2,829,263
men presented themselves for ser
vice, 1.679,263 being married and

claims that the Russian forces are
continuing to advance northeast
of Czernowitz despite numerous
counter attacks.

RUSSFOEPUT
TO FLIGHT ON
GALICIA LINE
Petrograd Tells of Continued
Retreat of the Teutonic
Forces Before Drive. .
COUNTER ATTACK FAILS
Germans Attempt to Relieve
Pressure by Charge, but
Without Result.
Petrograd, Jan. 3, 2 p. m. (via Lon
don, 8:20 p. m. Delayed.) By hold
ing the Teutonic 1 forces on the line
of the Vladimir-Volynskyi, on the Ga
lician frontier, while fortifying and
pressing forward at some points, the
Russians have checked the German
attempt to advance from the direc
tion of Kolki and Improve their posi
tion along the Kovelry eastward to
wards Sarny. North of Czartorysk
the Russians drove the Germans back
and occupied Khraisl. The very fact
that the Russians are advancing along
the Kovel-Rovno railway Is held by
military men to be of great impor
tance, since it indicates a concentra
tion with a view of taking Kovel, an
important point of communication be
tween the German and Austrian front
In order to relieve the pressure on
the Kovel-Sarny line, the Teutons
counter attacked southwest of Kolkl,
but without result, it is announced
here.
Driven Back 15 Miles.
On the Galician front, It is stated
In reports received in Petrograd, be
tween the rivers Sereth and Strypa,
before which the Russian troops had
taken up positions, the Russians ap
parently have commenced an offensive
and advanced as far as the left bank
of the Strypa between Buczacz and
Sokolow. The region on the left bank
of the Styr is still held against ser
ious attempts of the Austrlans to ad
vance. The greatest activity appears
now along the Strypa on both sides
of Buczacz. Here the Russians have
driven the opposing forces back from
15 to 17 miles from their positions.
It is stated the Russians continue to
hold and to fortify the newly ac
quired territory, although the battle
is still progressing.
900 Germans Taken.
The capture of the heights north of
Czernowitz, where nearly 900 pris
oners were taken, is held by military
experts here to be of special impor
tance. They predict that it probably
will result in forcing the evacuation
of Czernowitz by the Teutonic allies,
giving the Russians a strong foothold
in the center of Bukowina and control
of the railways into Rumania.
Austrlans Forced Back.
The Russky Invalide prints the fol
lowing regarding the situation:
"The Russian offensive on the long
front of 225 miles from Czartorysk to
the Rumanian frontier started when
our troops crossed to the left bank of
the Styr, taking Khriask, at the foot
of the Meddeezhskl heights. The Aus
trlans are making every effort to re
take these heights, which command
the Styr. North of Ollka and at Sil
no our troops advanced and fortified
the occupied region of Uscieczko, 10
miles north of Zaleszczky, and forced
the Austrians to the right bank of
the Dniester."
Germans Tax Amusements.
Berlin, Jan. 4, (via London.) The
authorities of Neukoelln, one of Ber
lin's largest suburbs, have decided to
impose an amusement tax. Ten per
cent of the receipts of all theatres and
similar amusements will be collected.
Kewanee Raises $200 for Poles.
Kewanee, 111., Jan. 4. Kewanee
raised more than $200 for war suffer
ers in Poland through the efforts of a
committee appointed for the American-Polish
day by Mayor Baker.
VENTILATE DON'T
HIBERNATE,URGED
Chicago, Jan. 4. "Ventilate, don't
hibernate," was the warning given
Chlcagoans today by Dr. John Dill
Robertson, health commissioner, as
a result of the epidemic of grippe,
which has attacked thousands of per
sons in this city. There were 39S
deaths caused by pneumonia here last
week.
"Keep windows open In bed rooms
and remain out of doors as much as '
possible," the warning continues.
"Fresh air kills germs that may kill
