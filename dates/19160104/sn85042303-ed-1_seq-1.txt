CHAIRMAN OF EOARD OF COUNTY
COMMISSIONERS STATES THAT
HE WANTS MONEY COUNTY IS
ENTITLED TO.
"I am going to insist on the refund
ing to Carter county its share of the
automobile tax of 1913," said J. H.
Taliaferro, chairman of the Doard of
County Commissioners, "and also in
sist on the payment of the one-fourth
of one mill which Carter county is
entitled to from the state treasury.
The new license is due and payable,
but so far we have not received n
cent. We need the money now, and
j some effectual work could be done on
the roads if we had it. It means
several thousand dollars to Carter
county, and the state treasurer has
no right to hoard that money up.
If it takes legal steps to get i!, then
the steps will be taken. I shall take
the matter up with the county attor
ney at once, and you can say that if
there is any way in the world in
which we can get this road money
which belongs to us, we are going to
get it."
Nearly ten thousand dollars will
be collected from Carter county on
the state auto tax this month if all
owners secure tags, as provided by
law. Half this amount was collected
last year, and ninety per cent of the
entire total, or roughly speaking at
least eight thousand dollars, should
be returned to the county treasurer
for expenditure on the roads of the j
county.

The newspap. r fraternity over the

Colonel Suggs left today for north

OTHER CITIES.
City Commissioner Joe M. London
will leave tomorrow to inspect inciner

nuike a thorough report to the mayor
and board of commissioners upon his
return.
Mr. London stated that Ardmore had
outgrown the dump ground stage and
if it desired to be ranked as an up to
date city, It must adopt up to date
methods in every department of city
affairs, and that there was nothing
that was as badly needed at present
as a method of disposing of the gar
bage now being dumped on the out
skirts of the city, where it remained a
disease-breeding ground.
Mr. London biate3 that a plant of
this time to burn :.U city refuse would
pay its upkeep aft?.- havirg been in

could lie installed with little trouble,
if !be neceisarv cash was available.
The members of the board are very
anxious to have a cluck installed, but
are aMt'se to going into debt to do
so at this time, as there are other
ami more vital needs of the county.
The c lock originally installed never
gave satisfaction, and the county coni-inis.-ioners
refused to pay for it, with
the result that it was removed. Mem
bers of the board stated last night
that when another was purchased It
would be of the old-fashioned kind
that never fails, and not one so com
plicated that it required the services
of ii ii electrical engineer to keep it
going.
The citizens of the city will hail
with delight the installation of a new
clock in the court house tower.
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT INVESTI
GATION IS GOING TO BEGIN IS
ONLY TIP THEY NEEDED TO
GET OUT OF COUNTY.
There will no doubt be a scatter
ing of "the profession" in Ragtown
and in the oil fields, now that the
word has gone forth that Judge Free
man Is going to start an investiga
tion Into conditions said to exist in
that locality, and many knights of the
green cloth, and vendors of booze,
beer, and casing-head gas, will no
doubt fold up their little lay-outs and
fade Into the dim and hazy distance.
Judge Freeman was to have begun
this investigation today, but he is con
fined to his homo wilh lagtippe, hut
as soon as ho is able to be in his
office, things will begin to happen.
Already many well known charac
ters have arrived in this city and de
parted southward towarl the general
direction of Mexico, but there is a
bunch still out tirrj who no doubt
will be placed on the grill an soon as
the court can Mtend to bininrr.s.
When fio liJ went on in Ardmore,
many well known fgnrrs moved to
Wirt nnd the oil field districts and
oprncd up "wide." If a raid was
mad on one joint todiy, another
nuum uer ujie:ifii hh toon as Inf Oi
fleer's back was turned, and under
the circumstances It would have
taken n battr-Iion of the National
Guard to have kpt thi ig-i cloned.

question of dam and power
PLANT IS AGAIN COMING
FORE THE PUBLIC GAZE.
QUESTION ABOUT VALUE.
BE-
NO
A prominent citizen of the city who
desires that his name be withheld for
the present stated yesterday that he
had about lined up a company with am-
pie capital to put over the often talked
about Washita power dam northeast of
the city, and within a few days would
let the public know the details if the
deal went through as he anticipated.
The question of harnessing the
Washita has been broached in this
city for several years, plans for the
plant have been made from time to
time and a survey of the site made by
several different companies. All agree
that it would he a paying proposition
is enough power could be developed
to furnish electricity to the entire
southern section of the state and to
north Texas cities as well, and con
tracts are ready to be signed by many
of these cities as soon as the plant was
ready to furnish the power. Civil en
gineers who have surveyed the site,
are confident that there is not another
like it in Oklahoma or Texas and rec
ommend that the plant be built. The
gentleman who has had the matter up
with his associates for some time,
states that he hopes to have actual
work begin within a few months, and
the plant in operation within the com
ing year.

from the White House by Wil-

they were "taking every means
jto obtain the cold facts and will
act as soon as the information

It was expected that an attack

Grant Tells of Sinking.
Alexandria, Kgypt, Jan. 4. Charles
Grant of Hoston, one of the two
known Americans on the Persia, ar
rived hero today giving the most de
tailed account of the sinking. He
said that most of the passengers wera
lunching when the steamer sank and
that many thought the torpedo's ex
plosion was a boiler bursting. There
was no panic, he said. The passen
gers marched to the life boats as in
a drill, but as the vessel was listing,
it was impossible to launch the star
board boats. The last he saw of the
Persia, her bow was in the air for
about five minutes after the explos
ion. He floated on wreckage unt'l
four o'clock the next morning, when
he was picked up by lifeboats. Th'tv
proceeded for three hours to the
frequent paths of the steamships, an I
later was picked up by a cruiser,
which soon found four other lifeboats.
