Announcement
(BY THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES)
€J This, kind readers, is a good-cheer announcement
to you.
fl Beginning with this month January, The Times'
rate, delivered by carrier in the city, will be 25 cents,
instead of 30.
t| The Times is making the change in order to stand
ardize its rates, this reduction making them all uni
form. Moreover, The Times feels certain that the
new price of a quarter a month will prove so popular
with the reading public that hundreds of new sub
scribers will be added to our lists.
€J The Times believes that 1916 will prove a banner
year. It starts off with the whole country optimistic,
as never before.
CJ Prosperity promises are coming true.
9} This is the time for confidence, for energy and for
extension of business.
■ THIS IS THE YEAR OF PROMISE.
YES, YOU CAN
LEGISLATE 'EM
TO SOBERNESS
—Says Lord Mayor of London.
(As Tacoma lias just experienced the sensation of "going dry,"
the folle.wing article by the lord mayor of l.e.ndein, who says people
CAN be legislated out of drinking, is s|iecially timely. The hours of
drinking in Irtish "miinitieins centers" were cut from 16 hours to
.1 ■■- hours daily. The brewers' guild, of enormous political and
economic power, threatened v national uprising; hut Kngllshmen
Juki "grinned and liore It." The article also will lie of speee-tal inter
est here because it tells how the "no trenting" experiment which
I ngl.iii.l borrowed from Tacoma, where It was put in force by
Mayor Fawcett, has worked.—Kilitor Times.)
BY SIR CHAS. C. WAKEFIELD
i lx>rd Mayor of 1/melon.
(In an interview with Mary
Boyle O'Keilly.)
LONDON, Jan. 4.—You CAN
make people sober by act of liar
liament. You CAN legislate peo
ple suddenly into teetotalism!
A beer house open all day for
the sale of tea, cocoa, milk, with
mineral waters a specially,
sounds absurd in steady-drinking
England, but spartan Londoners
grinned and bore it, and brawny
dockers shivering under a raw
thaw imbibed beef tea without a
threat of dying in defence of
"four 'arf."
DRINK WAS PROVING A
GREATER FOE TO IS THAN
GERMANY! ENGLAND WAS
DRIFTING TOWARD DEFEAT
THHOfGH DRINKING. There
was a crying neerd to remove
temptation from soldiers return
ing on leave, or going "out
there."
Under war conditions, hun
dreds of thousands of men —yes,
and women—are tolling 70 and
80 —even 100 —hours a week, at
work causing Intense thirst find
exhaustion.
In the arsenal* where thou
sands labor ln hellish heat, men
coming on night shif took a nip
"to keep out the coiG." In mills
and factories other thousands tip
pled "to keep keyed up."
Jaded men crave stimulants:
Did
You?
Maybe you made a
New* Year resolution
to save money —and
maybe you didn't.
No difference.
Resolution or no reso
lution, what matters
is what you do now.
Start with a good
bank at once — and
make next week's de
posit next week. ,

millions of war workers had jilen
ty of money. During the first six
months of the war the nation's
drink bill increased |48,000,000
over the corresponding period of
the previous year!
Kngland began a war-time tem
perance iaiiipiiif-.ii with the "No
Treating order. The nearest
tavern to London where you can
stand that Is 1 6 miles away. A*
a result the fortnight just ended
has been the soberest ever ex
perienced In London. "No Treat
ing" instantly produced a mark
ed decline in drinking.
Next, the hours of drinking
were cut from 16 to 6 1-2 daily.
Public bouses are open only from
noon to 2:30 and from 6:30 to
9:30. Curiously enough, there
is no rush of thirsty men at noon.
The new drinking restrictions
have placed $4,!)00,000,000 capi
tal Invested In breweries, hotels,
restaurants and i-ooperages In
chancery, much of It In danger of
bankruptcy. But now is not the
time when vast vested interests
can cry "Halt" against the public
good!
A dlmlnlHldng consump
tion of liquor Is enabling the
workers to save their money;

With Ground Frozen
I And Snow Deep In
The Hills, a Change
In Wind Means An
Outrush of Waters
By Edgar C. Wheeler
One warm breath of Chi
nook, the r.n<-w Kater," and
a flood such as the northwest
bus seldom -«'i-n will break
loose from the blankeHed
foothill* and sweep ek.wn
eeiili fury through the Puy
ullup valley in a tiolllng iiatli
of ill-.!rii. (inn.
This Is the prediction to
day of nlil-itiui-i-K In Tacoina
who recall the great snow
und rtiM.il of Isho.
They are backeail up In
their prediction by the weath
er mail and by the very ap
peui-iiiii-i- of tlie snow-laden
nioiiiitnlns and foothills.
The mountain anil hills nre
glistening while with a heav
ier covering of snow Hum
they have had for many,
years, says the weather man.
Not only that, but the
greiund is fro/eu solid below,
ready nt the first thaw to
Join with the snow in streams
to make v swollen river more
angry.
With the sun out and tbe air
growing warmer, tbe old-timers
are speaking in whispers of the
warm Chinook wind which can
creep silently over the mountains,
which can raise the temperature
of the atmosphere 40 degrees In
1 .*. minutes, and which can cut the
snow like magic, turning it into
roaring floods in a day.
Tbe weather conditions which
have attended tbe blizzard cen
tered in the- northwest for the- last
two days spooklshly renemble
those which preceded the Puyal
lup river flood of February, 1880,
they say—a biting northeast wind,
hillsides buried in snow, earth
first frozen deep.
Winil Shii'i Dangerous.
Now look out, they warn.
A sudden thaw right,now would
certainly mean a flood, tlie extent
of which would be difficult to
estimate, adds the weatherman.
When the wind turns to the
southwest, then good night.
The Puyallup river is Just
in the right mood to be at Its
angriest. Since I lie waters of
the While river were turned
into it, it ha* n greater vol
ume than ever liefore In its
history.
It is in a temper to turn
against the engineers of the
inter-county river improve
ment work who have been
out to bridle it and drug it
from Us lazier meandering
Into a straight course.
If, spurred on by hundreds of
streams of melted snow and ice,
it takes a notion to break loose —
The engineers declure they are
not expecting a flood in the Puy
allup valley at this time of the
year. Yet it is evident today that
they are uneasy. They are rush
ing the work on the cut-offs, driv
ing piles and strengthening the
banks,, saying they expect the
river will be turned into its new
course within a few day*.
How far the improvement work
at its present state would be dam
aged or ruined by a big flood at
this time they were not ready to
say- They repeated they aren't
looking for a flood.
Kailroads Apprehensive.
The Northern Paclfc and Great
Northern, though their traffic Is
going along today without a
hitch, are looking first at snow
covered, ice-bound hills, and then
with foreboding at their tracks.
City Ready
For Flood
Commissioner Woods, head of
the public works department, said
today that the city would be in
good condition to withstand a
flood.
All, storm sewers that were
wrecked during the recent heavy
rains have been repaired and
there are no street fill* that are
In any danger of washing away.
The fill at 38th and G street*
Is the most recent fill In Tacoma.
All south-going street car* are
routed over It. The commission
er declared that thi* fill was In
unusually good condition, and
that even should <| >od waters
pile up ln the gulch behind it
there 1* practically no danger of
Its weakening.
What will happen if Chinook |
decides to breathe upon us?
"Say, it will be awful," wills-1
liered Frank Hobs, Tacoma obi- !
timer, today. "February, 1880. la
in the air again today. Just let
the old Puyallup break loose now,
with the White river water be
hind it and with tbe de»ep snow
and ice on the hills, and say, she'd
just rip everything to pieces. She'll
go tearing down through the val
ley like made, turning the iurms
and barnyards into one treat boil- i
lug lake.
"Hack in IHHO there were
few settlers in Ihe path of
the flood and little property
to lie destroyed, but now—
"Say, it would be awful."
WILSON
BACK ON
THE JOB!
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.—Hack I
from bis honeymoon, the presi

' formulating plans to take prompt,
' decisive steps to stop the Illegal >
submarine attacks. It is unre-j-
Bervedly admitted Hint tbe sltua-H

The following statement was
issued:
"The president and secretary
of state nre taking every means
possible to obtain the facts ln
this grave mailer and will act
just as soon as Information la
obtained."
The president conferred with I
Senator Stone and Secretary Lan
sing. No cabinet meeting will be

Congress Reconvenes.
Besides the Ancona and Persia
cases, tbe administration is con
fronted with diplomatic issues
arising from the torpedoing of
the Ulengyle, Yasaka .Muni, Cio
tat and Lusitania.
Congress reassembled at noon
and gave promise of partlci|>ating
in international affair*.
Senator Stone after tlie confer
ence with President Wilson de
clared the latter lack* full facts
in regard to tbe sinking of the
Persia, and that nothing decisive
will be done until these are ob
tained.
Secretary Lansing today told
Ambassador yon Bernstorff in
formally that the state depart
ment is considering modifying
its position e-oncerning gun*
aboard merchantmen.
MIGHT HAVK BKKN MINK
He said the changes in naval
warfare resulting from tbe exten

absence of German warships, ha*
caused the 17 S. to change It* po
sition.
It ia unofficially stated that
Germany and Austria will claim
the submarine was entitled to
sink the liner Persia becauae
there were gun* aboard.
Officials do not regard the evi
dence conclusive that the Persia
was torpedoed. Navy authorities
say she was possibly struck by a
mine.

JTHE LEANING TOWER OF PLEASURE
How to Settle It
The Fold peace party has now decided to employ
a [committee of experts in international law to draw
uj) tentative peace proposals on lines most likely to
be ae-i-eptable to the belligerents.
Merely as a well-intentioned suggestion we would
like to rci'oinnienil as members of aforesaid commit
tee of experts the following:
FRANCIS JOSEPH, of Austria,
NICHOLAS, of Montenegro,
FERDINAND, of Bulgaria,
WILLIAM 11, of Germany,
NICHOLAS 11, of Russia,
VICTOR EMANUEL, of Italy,
PETER, of Servia,
MOHAMMED V, of Turkey,
ALBERT, of Belgium, _
GEORGE V, of Great Britain,
RAYMOND POINCAIRE, of France,
YOSHIHITO, of Japan,
CHAIRMAN, UNCLE SAM, U. S. A.
. We are ready to guarantee that a peace protocol
agreed upon by this committee would get one dozen
more signatures than one drawn by any other com
mittee under the sun.

TACOMA
FIRST IN
HEALTH
Tacoma is tbe healthiest city of
its size in the United States, ac
cording to unofficial figures
given out by the city health bei
reau today.
Moreover, the city Is getting
more healthy each year. Tho
death rate for 1015 was 8.17 a
thousand inhabitants, based on
the government's census figures
of last July, wlil«2h gave Tacoma
108,000 populatlol.
During 191!) there were 83".
deaths in Tacoina according to
Health Officer Wall. In 1914 the
official death rate of Tacoina
was nine to every 1000 persons.
Although It is too early to ex
pect reports from other cities tho
size of Tacoma, Dr. Wall declares
his belief that no other city will
approach Tacoma's record. Dur
ing summer months the rate
dropped to six deaths per 1000,
and at that time Mayor Fawcott
announced that Tacoma was the
healthiest city in the entire
country, Irrespective of popula
tion.
A large number of deaths dur
ing the fall and winter brought
the average considerably higher,
however.
