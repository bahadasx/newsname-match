evident that the cabinet crisis is far
from ended. The -only definite point
is that Sir John Simon, secretary of

1 board of trade, is etill undecided- They
are. ma icing the acceptance of tne gov-,
eminent compulsion bill condition and
upon securing a concession, to their
views on the eventual size of the
army. In this matter Premier Asquith
is in an embarrassing position. He is
beipg strongly impelled from the out
side not to yield this point, and it is
believed & majority of the cabinet is
against their view.
Hence, today's meeting of the cabi
net, to consider the latest draft of the
bill, may result in further changes, and
possibly result in the resignations
ofthese two important ministers.
