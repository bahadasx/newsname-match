KILLING
Tennessee Men Meet Here In

TMHiMfl
T.J. TAYLOR SLAYS C. KNIGHT
Domestic Sandal Given As the
Catise ef Troable By
.Slayer..
A scandal that had its beginning
at Weaver's Store, Tenn., ended in
a homicide in a saloon here Saturday
night.
T. J. Taylor, aged 49, shot and in.
stantly killed Claud Knight, aged 23.
Taylor charges that he induced his
wife to leave him and their three
children several weeks ago.
A few minutes before the shooting
occurred, Taylor had been talking to
Police Lieutenant Hawkins, telling
him his troubles. He went to the
saloon from the police office, and
had just had a drink but is said to
have been sober, and was chatting
with the barkeeper when Knight en
tered the door. Without a word,
Taylor drew his pistol and began
firing and at the first shot Knight
reeled against a showcase, crying
out, "Don't do that." Taylor fired
twice more and .Knight fell to the
floor dying. One bullet struck him
in the left breast, 'making a flesh
wound, and the other entered just
to the left of the backbone and
ranged upward, probably striking
the heart. Taylor walked a square
to a store he was in the habit of pat
ronizing and when., came out a
policeman-was standing in front.
Taylor walked uiTto. the;officer and
surrendered When he reached the
police office he remarked to Lieut.
Hawkins, "I killed that man. I shot
him three times." This was all the
statement he'would make.
Those who know Taylor say he is
a man of excellent reputation, He
had talked to some of his friends
here in town previously about his al
leged marital troubles. Mrs. Taylor
is 38 years of nge.
Knight's body was removed from
the sa'oon to an undertaking estab
lishment, where it was prepared for
burial.
Knight's body was taken to Weav
er's Store Sunday for interment.
He was a son of Gus Knight.
" Mrs, Toy'or was in the city at the
! time the tragedy took place.
Taylor is in jail, but it is said can
give bond for almost any amount.
People of the Lafayette neighbor
hood give Taylor a good reputation
as a peaceful, quiet citizen.

TALK OF
BOND ISSUE
For Building ef Future Turn

Cwnty.
FISCAL COURT'S NEW POLICY
Resolutions Adopted to Build
No New Pikes Out of
Levy For 1916.
"Be it resolved, That it is the
sense of this Fiscal Court that no
new turnpikes or metal roads
shall be bu'lt or constructed out
of the Road and Bridge levy for
1916, since the said levy is not
sufficient and is now totally in-
adequate to do the necessary re-
pair work on the dirt roads and
.old turnpikes and to carry out
the present contracts now in
force.
At a called meeting of the fiscal
court held Friday the above resolu
tion was unamimously adopted, This
resolution was offered by County
Judge Knight and it was promptly
seconded and as promptly passed.
Furthermore a committee consist
ing of the entire court, together
with County Attorney Smith ttnd
Road Engineer Dillman and Judge
Knight, was appointed to meet with
the Christian County Good Roads
Association at some date to be
agreed upon and consider the propo
position of takihg a vote on a big
bond issue, the proceeds to be used
for good roads. This meeting-will
be held as soon as practicable and if
it is decided at that time that an
I election on a bond issue is liable to

called for some date in the . early
spring.
For the past six years, the Court
has been spending $20,000 to $39,000
on new turnpikes. Last year it
spent $25,000, the entire road and
bridge fund being $35,000. This left
only $10,000 with which to repair
and keep in repair GOO miles of dirt
roads and 200 miles of turnpike, an
amount entirely inadequate.

AUSTRIA'S
15 BACK-DOWN
4
Meets Cardinal Points of Amer-
ican Demands Better Than
. Germany Has Done.
NOW LIKE LUSITANIA CASE
f
Prints Left for Further Discus-
sion Are Not Likely to
Bring New Crises.
Washington, Jan. 3. Austria's
reply- to the Ancona note not only
raaats the cardinal points of the
American demands but giv?s assur
ances for the future which are con
sidered more satisfactory in their
extent than those which were given
by Germany.
The full American official view
will not be known until after Presi
dent Wilson has. studied the Austrian
reply, which was received Friday
from Ambassador Penfield and was
immediately dispatched to Hot
Springs by a White House messen
ger. It may be stated authoritatively,
nevertheless, that danger of a rup
ture of diplomatic relations has
passed andthe controversy now tn
ters'the same stage as the Lusftania
negotiations with Germany,' on even
a more favorable basis.
PASSENGERS WILL BE SAVED.
Austria in the Ancona case has
subscribed" to the principle that no
ship will be sunk unless they offer
resistance or flee, without the per
sons aboard being brought to safety.
This is considered an assurance that
is far-reaching and satisfactory.
Germany only promised not to at
tack "liners" until the person aboard
had been placed in boats. The ex
tent of the designation liners has
never been cleared up and the Amer
jean government does not concede
that placing persons in boats neces
sarily assures their safety.
Points which Austria leaves for
further diplomatic correspondence
are not considered of a nature to
bring on a new crisis.' Chief among
them are questions of fact which af
fects Austria's responsibility for what
happened before the submarine com
mander torpedoed the Ancona and
their importance i3 minimized by the
nromise to pay indemnity for the
Americans lost regardless of the ab
sence of proof as to just how they
met their death.

tells 'a. different story. He states
that when Chiles appeared on the

and that Chiles said "all right." and
then shot him. Chiles left the prem

GENERAL
ASSEMBLY
Will Begin Its Session To-day-Caucuses
Held Yestcr-
DUFFY AND COMBS SPEAKERS
Effort to Be Made to Revise
Stale's Antiquated Taxa
tion Laws.
Frankfort, Ky., Jan. 3. Ken
tucky's capital to-day presents a
scene similar to that enacted every
two years upon the eve of the con
vening the legislature, The assem
bly will not be formally convened
until Tuesday, although both demo
crats and republicans will hold cau
cuses today.
It is conceded that Capt. H. C.
Duffy of Harrison county, will be
chosen speaker of the lower house of
the general assembly without opposi
tion. Thomas A. Combs of Lexing
ton will be chosen president pro tem.
of the senate without opposition.
Eli Berry, who was clerk of the
house at the last session, likely will
be selected clerk.. He was in Stan
ley headquarters all through the
primary campaign and in the gener
al campaign.
Jesse Alverson and Capt. Wiley
Dixon are candidates for clerk of
the senate.
The most important legislation to
be considered this session will be the
enactment of a law revising the
state s antiquated system ot taxa
tion. This law, before it can- be
come effective, must be ratified by
popular vote.
Efforts, it is said, will be made by
both prohibitionists and women's
suffrage advocates to force through
measures providing for referendum
votes on these two issues. The
"drys" passed a prohibition amend
ment through both branches of the
legislature last session, but were un
able to put the measure up to the
people because of its lacking a con
stitutional majority in the senate.
Mothers' pei sions, probably, will
come in for a share of the legisla
ture's deliberations, as will a pro
posed workmen's compensation act,
a corrupt practices statute and the
elaboration of road laws now on the
books.
