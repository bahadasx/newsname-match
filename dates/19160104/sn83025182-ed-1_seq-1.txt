Cloud Over Congress.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.—A cloud
hung over the reassembling of Con
gress today following the holiday re
cess. Gravity of senators and repre
sentatives over the foreign situation
growing out of the Ancona and Per
sia Incidents was pronounced.
Committee consideration and the
speeches on the floor regarding the
international problems. Impended.
Various senators, including Smith, of'
Georgia, and Borah, were reported
planning addresses on diplomatic re
lations. That no curb is to be im
posed on the discussion of the Coun
try's foreign affairs, was tacitly un
derstood. Sharp attacks upon the
central powers' submarine campaigns
and the allies' commercial Interfer
ences were certain.
Before the senate foreign relations
committee, were numerous questions,
Including the resolutions of Senators
... Smith of Georgia, and Lodge, for the

were all askew. No definite program,
even of proceedure, was before con
gress. National defense hearings were
to have begun today before the house
naval committee, but they were p6sf
poned until tomorrow. Necessity for
more government navy yards to build
war craft was discussed. Including
the proposed $3,000,000 dry dock at
Norfolk. Army preparedness hear
ings will begin Thursday before the
house military committee with Secre
tary of War Garrison the first wit

Growing opDosltlon both to the pre

a marked feature of sentiment among
returning congressmen.
The senate naval committee today
considered Senator Tillman's bill for
a $11,000,000 federal armor plate

The official statement confirmed
previous reports that the Lord Derby
campaign had proven a failure. It
was made public by the government
to show why It was necessary to
adopt some form of conaortptlon. It
called attention to the fact that 651,
160 men can be added to the British
armies by 'drafting only single meit
of military age not urgently needed
in other occupations.
A surprising feature of the report
was the statement that about fifty
nine per cent of the married men of
military age, whereas only fifty-three
per Cent or the single men, offered
themselves for service.
When the Derby recruiting cam
paign was inaugurated, It was un
derstood that if recruits came for
ward in sufficient force the govern
ment would decide definitely agalnct
conscription, A special appeal wa*
made to unmarried men to enlist.
Of 2,179,231 single men of military
age In the united kingdom, only
150,000 volunteered. Of those who
failed to enroll, 378,071 are exempted
from military service because they
hold "proferred" positions in govern
ment service or other duties, making
It inadvisable that they Join the army.
631,601 single men were available.
The government bill introduced this
week will call part or all of these men
Into service. Of 2,632,210 married
men of military age, 1,679,281 enroll
ed under the .t£e

the present, to dVaft married men for

SIMON RESIGNED.
LONDON, Jan. t.—Premier 'Asquith
this afternoon confirmed the report
that Sir John Simon, secretary of
state for home affairs, has resigned
from the cablpet.
The announcement was made In
the house of commons following to
day's session of the cabinet on the
conscription question. It has been
rumored for several days that Sir
John had quit the cabinet because of
his opposition to compulsory military
service.
Though It was reported that other
ministers would resign because the
conscription policy has been adopted,
every member except Simon attended
today's cabinet session.
Sir John Simon Is a liberal in poll
tics and has served in a previous cabi
net as attorney general. He was
given the portfolio of home secretary
when the coalition cabinet was form
ed several months ago.
CALLED TO THE COLORS.
LONDON, Jan. 4.—Single men be
tween the ages of ?3 and 26, inclu
sive, who enlisted in the Derby re
cruiting campaign were today called
to the colors. They are to report for
service on February 8.
The call was Issued following ad
journment of a cabinet meeting at
which the ministers agreed on the
form of conscription and following
publication of figures showing the
Derby campaign to have been a fail

Groups six to nine under the Derby

BERLIN, Jan. 4.—Regret la express
ed almost universally in Berlin over
the sinking of the British liner Per
si« with heavy loss of life, Just as
heroic efforts were being made to re
pair Teutonic-American relations.
The public understood that Aus
tria's last note had cleared the way
for a complete understanding. The
newspapers,' too, took the view .that
the submarine question had at last
been settled. Consequently the sink
ing of the Persia came as a severe
shock.
No Information has reached here as
to whether a German or Austrian sub
marine sank the Persia. Officials de
clined to comment until the report
of the submarine oommander has
been received.
The newspapers carry English re
ports of the sinking of the Persia, to
gether with English reports of Its ef

refrains from comment, suspecting
that the reports from English sources
may be misleading.
