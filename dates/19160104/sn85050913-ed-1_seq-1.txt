Some of the City Employees Quit
attd Their PI**. Take by
Others.
As was- expected when the city
council readjusted the wage scale,
putting it, with a few exceptions,
where it was before the old council,
through Its committees, Increased it
during the last few months of its,
existence, some of the city employees
quit their jobs. The increases, ex
cept that given the city clerk, were
made by some members of the com
mittees without the knowledge of
other members of the same commit
tee or the council, which issnat the
proper way totrarisact public busi
ness. "Whether the wage scale was
too high or too low, the method pur
sued by the old council committees
was against public policy and slould
not be tolerated ufcder any circum
stances. The city should pay as
good a rate of wages as others pay
for the same kind of service, but the
scale should be established by a reso
lution of the* Council, not by the se
cret manipulation of a part of a cojn-
mittee-

ley Gardner of ties Moines, ttr»er
iy wttli the Fort Dodge, Des Molhes

position of lineman formerly filled
by Mr. Breed. But Mr. Gardner can
not be here inside of a couple of
weeks, and his brother, W. N. Gard
ner, now with the Fort Dodge Light

tion temporarily. Bert Beckner and
'Joe Rutledge, both of whom have
had considerable experience In the
work, are on the job as firemen. Miss
Fannie Baxter has accepted the po
sition of-clerk at the electric shop
in place of Miss Lena Martin. I. E.
Beckner and Joe Dlngman, inside
wiremen, Elmer Risner, engineer,
and Ed Helm, firemen, are retained.
The city plants are being operat
ed as usual and there is no doubt in
the mind of the Freeman-Tribune
but that Geo, J. Long will fill the
position- to which the council recent
ly appointed him in a satisfactory
manner. At any rate, he Is entitled
to a fair and impartial trial and this
we believe the people, with the ex
ception of a few who have axes to
grind, are willing to grant him.

Engineer.
At the meeting of the council
Friday night, H. .0. Vollmer was
elected city manager at a salary of
$1~,800 per year. There were many
applicants for the place, but the
council picked Mr. Vollmer because
in their, judgment he is fully capable
of filling the position, just as cap
able as any applicant, besides he
was willing to make a try-out at a
salary that may be considered low.
He visited Webster City a month or
so ago, and informed members of the
council that the salary on the start
was not the controlling considera
tion. He wanted an opportunity to
show the people what he could do
and was willing to let the future
take care of the matter of compen
sation.
Mr. Vollmer is a man between 35
and 40 years of age and has a fam
ily. He will come to Webster City
as soon as possible and expects to
make this his future home. He Is at
present serving his sixth term as
city engineer of the city of Burling
ton under tho city commission form
of government and Is a graduate of
the civil engineering department of
the State University at Iowa City.
Mr. Vollmer has alBO had wide ex
perience in large business affairs.
The people of Webster City will
extend a hearty welcome to Mr.
Vollmer and his family and will
hope, that he may prove to be a sat
isfactory- man as city manager. Ev
erybody who has the Interests of the
town at heart will offer every en
couragement, aud work ip harmony
with Mr. Vollmer to make a bigger
and better town and give the city a
successful business administration.

WAR WILL PURIFY
THE PLAYHOUSES
United' Press Correspondent Has In
terview With High Authority
in City of Paris.
Paris,' Jan. 3.—"What effcct will
the war have on the theatre?" I
put this question to MJ Lugne Poe,
one of Europes brightest dramatic
lights, playwright, actor and pro
ducer. Said he:
"The most far-reaching imagin
able. No possible event could have
a greater or a better influence- on
the playhouse than this war. The
contemporaneous French stage is
putrid, rotten, detestable and you
Americans are largely responsible
for making it so." I asked him how
that was so.
"You did it with 'your dollars,
the great author-actor-manager
said. "Of courso you didn't do it
purposely. It was simply' your in
fluence on us. Successful plays in
the United States becaine mints, and'
the authors who perpetrated them
almost millionaires. French authors
wero contaminated. They wrote
"popular" stuff, or tried to with an
eye to possible future adaptation for
the American stage. Result? Rot

And how will the war change
things?" I wanted to know.
"Simply by blasting us out of the

drifted along too busy to* think of
a change. For more than a year
