URDER CISES
Man Said to Have Been Mem
ber of Whitey Black Gang
Told Over the Tele
phone to "Lay Low."
SUSPECT IS BROUGHT
BACK FROM TOLEDO
John Sobkowiak Admits He
Was in City on Day of
Murder But Claims
an Alibi.
That one of the murderers of
Henry Muesel and Frsnk Chrobot
was a member of the "Whitey"
Rlack gang of safe robbers and stick
up men which nourished here several
years ago. was the report given to
the police department Tuesday. This
new angle of the double murder
mystery was being investigated Tues
day by the department although it
could not be learned whether or not
the man who was formerly mixed up
with "Whitey" Rlack had been
placed under arrest.
According to the report, the man,
who has borne a shady reputation
here, was oerheard to telephone
someone and warn him to "lay low."
The conversation was reported to the
police and the actions of the alleged
crook were so unusual as to excite
suspicion. In telling the person at
the other end of the telephone line
to "lay low" the former member of
the Rlack gang, mentioned the
aames of some policemen.
Just what the irolice have on the
al.eged crook is not known but it
a certain that the man is being in
vestigated. Chief Kue.pert returned from To
ledo early Tuesday morning with
John Sobkowiak, 28 years old. who
is held a& a suspect in. connection
with the double murder. .Sobkowiak
was arrested Monday by the Toledo
police at the request of Chief Kues
pert. The man did not object to
being brought back here, stating that
he was innocent of the charge and
could prove an alibi.
Chief Kerr said Tuesday afternoon
that although there were several
questions unsettled regarding Sob
kowiak the department has been un
able to secure any conclusive evi
dence against him. The Toledo man
admits being in South Rend on the
day of the double murder, alleging
that he came here in search of work,
understanding that he could secure
employment in a local lumber yard.
He says he did not like the work and
returned to Toledo Friday morning.
It is understood that Sobkowiak
has not answered several questions
satisfactorily regarding his presence
in the city and will be held until
such time as he does. Although
Sobkowiak Js known to the Toledo
police he has never caused any se
rious trouble.
No lVwal-ki Arreted. .
Information to the eiTect that Henry
Pewalski. a resident of the west
side, had been arrested Sunday af
ternoon and was considered almost
a safe bet as implicated in the mur
der was denied by the department
and by Pewalski himself Monday
night.
There is no record of any Pewal
ski arrest at the city hall, but there
is a record of a telephone demand
made by the west side resident that
the police see to it a. correction is
made regarding his alleged connec
tion with the case.
From Information gained Monday
night, the officers have made what
they consider a valuable arrest, but
his name is not Pewalski. though he
does live in the west part of the
city. The name has been with
held. ITERS 1H CENTRAL

INDIANA RECEDING
What the Derby Scheme is
When Lord Derby was put in charge of the recruiting in Eng
land he outlined a plan by which men might volunteer for im
mediate or subsequent service. The recruits who enlisted for
service at a later date were divided into groups. Those who en
listed tor immediate service at the regulation armv recruiting
points were sent into training at once. Preference was given to
single men.
Those who enlisted under the group system for service were
divided into "starred" and "unstarred""men. The "starred"
men were the ones untit for active service, but who could be
in the arsenals or elsewhere under the dirction of the war office.
The "unstarred" men were the ones available for use as soldiers
at the front. In calling up the groups of "unstarred" men the
youngest unmarried men will be called upon tirst, the married
men being left till the last.

STEADY PROGRESS
S MADE BY RUSS
Petrograd Reports That Aus

Forced Back.
International News Service:
LONDON, Jan. 1. Steady prog
ress is being made by the Russians
in their great offensive movement on
the frontier of Rukowina (southern
Calicia). It is officially reported in
Petrograd that the Austro-Hungar-ian
troops holding the line northeast
of Czernowltz are Jailing back be
fore the assaults of the czar's troops.
Fighting is going on in bitter cold
weather amidst the snow-filled val
leys of the mountains east of the
liver Pruth.
(Jen. Ivanoff, who was put into
command of the big group of Rus
sian armies when Czar Nicholas took
command in the eastern theater of
war. is directing the operations on
the Galician front.
It is reported that the German
war office, alarmed at the violence
of the Russian attacks, has ordered
large detachments of German troops
and masses of artillery to Bukowina
to prevent another Russian drive
toward Hungary such as took place
la.t winter.
However, before the Russians
I could gain a position which would
j menace the Austro-German lines of
i communication Into the Balkans,
they would have to cross the Car
pathians in the face of insuperable
difficulties.
Vienna professes the belief that
Russia has concentrated a majority
of her first line troops on the Ga
lician front and nilitary experts
now look for another German drive
on the Dvinsk front, to offset the
pressure against the Teutons further
south.
lOOMi:i TO FAIL.
BERLIN, Jan. 4. (via Amster-

I military experts, the renewed Rus
sian offensive on the Ressarabian
I front is the opening effort to ac
complish another big drive through
Galicia, to outflank the German
forces in the north and to compel
the abandonment of the campaign
against Riga and Dvinsk. This
"ambitious scheme, plainly visible
even to those having only a rudi-
mentary knowledge of military
strategy," they declare to be doomed
to failure, though the Russians are
aid to have concentrated more than
f 0 0,000 men of the first line for the
drive. All the artillery that could
be spared from other sections of the
front has also been gathered to sup
port the intended Russian advance.

International News Serriee:
LONDON, Jan. 4. Lord Derby's
report showing how many Britons
volunteered for service under his re
cruiting scheme was made public to
day. It shows that 651.16" single men
failed to volunteer.
A total of 2.184,979 was attested.
Of these, however, only 1,4 23.10 4
are available for active service in
the field. The men who through
some defect are not fit for field
service total 761,875.
Owing to the rush of recruits
925,443 attested men were not
given a medical examination. This
will be done when they are called up
for service.
It is estimated that the net num
ber of available single men who at
tested is 343,386; married men, 481,
67C. llguros Arc Ixv.
The figures ontained in the Derby
report were not as high as had been
expected and it was for that reason
that a modified form of conscrip
tion was agreed upon by the cabinet.
The Derby recruits were divided
Into groups of "starred" and "un
starred" men. The "starred" men
are the ones unfit for active service
as soldiers under arms. The "star
red" group will be used as munition
workers or in some other field.
The totals of the groups are:
"Starred" men: Single, 312,067;
married, 4 49,808.
"Unstarred" men: Single, 527,933;
married, 895.151.
The total number of men of mil
itary nged dealt with at the opening
of Lord Derby's recruiting campaign
were:
2,17,231 Bachelors.
Bachelors, 2,179,231; married men,
2,832,210. At the end of the cam
paign a total of 1,150.000 single men
and 1,679,263 married men had been
enlisted for immediate service, had
attested or had been rejected as un
fit. Between Oct. 11 and Dec. 19 a
total of 273,031 single and married
men had enlisted for immediate ser
vice. The total number of men rejected
upon medical grounds was 4 28,8 53.
Those who attested under the
group system numbered 2.246.630.
Considerable difficulty was exper
ienced by the managers of Lord
Derby's scheme in "starring" the
men, that is. in separating- them into
the proper groups for service in dif
ferent branches of military work.
Cabinet in Session.
The cabinet met today to settle, if
possible, the final details of the modi
fied conscription bill. There was
keen opposition to the proposition
that Ireland should be excluded from
the workings of the measure; the op
positicn against Including Ireland
was fully as strong.
Premier Asquith was understood to I
be very anxious to introduce the bill
in the house of commons tomorrow,
but it was considered doubtful
whether the details could be worked
out in time.
The bill may be modeled after the
