"The President and 'the Secre

Inflamed further while the President

nounced that they were to be advised
of the steps and developments in tho

tending that in such a teriout
situation at the preient promiiet
to become Conareu should be
consulted in any movet which
may involve the country In meat

An axpeotcd attack an the Admin

avoided by a hanty adjournment of
