i TAX PROBLEM
DISCUSSED BY
ONE WMOWS
Ex County Commissioner Gives Side
lights on Some Causes for the
Heavy Tax Burden
Tho following statement with ref
erence to Bomo conditions which ex
ist that tend to mako the taxes in
Cacho County high on the property
owner, has been prepared by Ex-County
Commissioner O It "Cronqulst.
Mr. Cronqulst has given tho ques
tion of taxes considerable study and
is In a position to speak authorlta-
lively on this all important sublet.
t Since the holding "of the taxpayers
convention at Nlbloy Hall Wednesday
December 22, 1915, at which mem
bers of tho State Hoard of Equaliza
tion were present, thero havo boon
many discussions on tho question of
taxation from various ang'.es. Tho
V wholo contention of the state board
M was to Justify their present position
S to assess property on tho actual cash
'M valuation basis, Including all ral
j estate, Improvements, livestock"," etc.,
M in fact all property that Is not ox
B erupted by law, to bo assessed at ac
iSj tual cash value.
ffl Chairman William Dallcy of the
M State Hoard, had many facts In hand
M and lie stated his caso In a way that
J It tickled tho ears of his hearers and
tm ho received a hearty hand clap when
IM ho told his audience that ho favored
m excluding all Improvements from tho
m tax roles. A bowed head was tho
result when ho stated that to reduco
jH the waste of public money which goes
tho road building would suffer. Tho
farmers could not seo what they wero
I being led Into if wo do not assess
I improvements. Tho burden would
M again fall upon tho farms.
X Why did not Mr. Balloy say that
S ho favored a proposition whereby ma-
I chlnery and horses would bo exempt
m" If ho really wanted to lighten tho
M" burden of the farmers? If thero Is
m anything that should bo exempt from
M taxation, in my opinion, It shou'd bo
h the motlvo power used In tho dovel-
opment of the farm, such as the
V horses and machinery. Tho farm Is
j taxed to tho oxtcnt of Its productive
ft. ness, nnd then tho equipment is tax
S ed which Is used to produce tho In
R',. como, Instead of removing Improve
K; ments from tho tax roles, I am firmly
wj of tho opinion that tho farm is suf
f flclently taxed when tho real estate
SJH has been included. If the taxpayers
H will reason this out with themsolvcs
fink they will sure nrrlvo at tho samo con
(Sfe' elusion.
Instcail of pointing out to tho tax-
MrS pnjers assembled that road building
2P? wou,(1 suitor if wo curtailed our pros-
jft ent tax Incomo, why did not tho
ino speaker suggest that it would bo im-
fix possible, to curtail tho oxpenso In)
S the ofllccs of tho various state, do-
iffi partments?
Tho best facts wo havo shown
HM conclusively that more than 80 per
Hr cent of tho tax money goes to tho
yjf schools. Why not curtail somo of
f th waste of public money which goes
ia to blgh salaried men? Wo want
lr moro monoy on our roadB If it la
jl spent Judiciously and wisely. It Is
.5 not this Item of oxponso that tho tax-
payers aro objecting to.
J Tho tax on real estate is becoming
tJ such a burdon that in many instances
yj it takes moro than tho amount pro-
duccd on J)io land, over and above
if tho actual oxponso of producing the
' income, to pay tho taxes. This bur-
den cou'd bo reduced in many ways.
, It Is not fair to tax land beyond what
' it will produce under good cultiva-
Why aro wo so scared about lotting
j tho wealthy corporations stand their
; . portion of the tax burden? Tho farm
ers seem to be afraid thoy will Btop
. on tho toos of tho officials thoy havo
i o'ectcd to be tholr servants. Aro thoy
J not our servants? Will Mr. Balloy
m toll tho Cacho county farmers wb,y
fcjL tho assessment of tho Blacksmith
JFork canyon power plant was reduced
fcg from $05,000 to $05,000 by his board?
SL At tho samo tlmo will ho also oxplaln
flfet,tho reasons why his board was plac
Mlng a blanket ralso of 25 per cent on
r$all Cacho county real estato while
JBLjJhls reduction was being mado on
OlBftho power plant? T1iIr action by tho
wboard was taken in 1014, Just pro
IKCvlcun to this a reduction on the as
HRiessed va'uatlon of tho Oregon Short
KjlLIno Interosts In tills county, wero
Dp reduced $15,000. In theso two items
B Is found n reduction of $45,000, Was
k i
this reduction on theso corporation
mado up by tho 25 per cent increase
en Cacho county real ostato. Not
only wero reductions mado In thes?
two public utilities mentioned, but
tho board reduced tho valuation oi
practically all pub'Ic utilities In tho
county. It Is hard to make tho farm
ers and taxpayers of this section ol
the state feel that tho state board of
equalization Is tho friend of tho far
mor In vlow of these facts.
A corporation In Logan City which
under the law Is exmpt from taxes
was satisfied with a $0,000 assess
ment which our assessor placed on
tho corporation nnd Would havo paid
taxes on that amount. But Mr. Bnll
ey Bald No. Wo must lncrcaso the
valuation of that concern many times
tho $0,000. An appeal was made
from Mr. Bailey's decision nn.l the
concern, on tho advice of Its attorn
oy, paid taxes on $125, simply nn
amount to thko caro of the furniture
in tho ofllco. Wo should have had
upwards of $330 In the count:; traaB
ury and we got $7 because outside
Influences moddlcd In tho affair.
Tho farmers and taxpayers should
offect n strong organization that will
stand for legislation that will Include
such laws which bring about a Jusl
and fair valuation on assomblo prop
el ty. This organization should stand
for tho election of members of the
etaTo board of equalization by popu
lar vote. In this way wo could Bolect
men who would represent U3 fairly
men who have a knowledge of values
of land.
In tho matter of nrrlvlng at Mo
proper valuation to bo placed ori real
estnte, when tho readjustment to a
cash basis is made this spring, the
commissioners should meet With n
ropiesontatlvo committee, appointed
by the people of each town or pre
clnct and discuss these, problems to
gether, exchange Ideas and then
each community wi'.l know what is
going on in tho communities around
them in tho wny of assessments. In
this way a better feeling will main
tain. Tho commissioners should
meot several dajs with this commit
tee and dcternilno on tho apprnlso
mont, whether tho present valuations'
are to bo Increased ono, two or
three, times tho present valuations.
It must- be j-ememboredHjiat'no'fnrm
land should bo assessed for more
than it wli produce under gopd cul
tivation. Because seme assessable
property should bo Increased in value
moro than two and a half times the
present valuation, In ordor to get
tho needed revonuo tho present ex
penso of tho state demands, It can
not bo shown whore farm prorerty
should bo incrensed moro than two
nnd n half times tho present vnlua"
tlons. If It is, then the tax burden
will bo ovon higher than at proceut.
This Is a matter for tho taxpayers
to pay particular attention to.

who has decided to mako Logan his
homo, having moved his family horo,
was clearly tho favorite of tho oen

Bill Buchtl rlnnod Benny Burgoss'
shoulders to tho mat twico in five
minutes. In tho boxing preliminary,
George Well and Bill Stropoy went
thrco rounds to n draw.
Tho six round main event between
Eddie McKenna and Glen Gutke went
tho full six rounds to a draw. McKen
