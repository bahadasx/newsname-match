Written for the United i"ress.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4. Ai the close
of 1915 the war ha cost more than
twenty-six billion dollars, exceeding
by five hundred million thtl total na
tionul dents of the elx principal bellig
erent powers when the conflict began.
With the exception of about fivo hun
dred million raised in the Vnited
Kingdom by taxation, practically all
the expenses of the war have been
met by borrowed money The end of
PJ15 therefore, finds the fighting na
tions saddled with double the dett
they had accumulated in all the cen
turies preceding tho outbreak of the.
war.
In the early days of the war the
most liberal estimate of Its cost, in
cluding the destruction of property
and the economic losses caused by
casualties, was fifty million dollars
per day". The actual expense now. cx-j
elusive of economic and property
losses, Is eighty-five million per day.
Of this amount the Quadruple Entente
Is paying two-thirds and the Teutonic!
Allies one-third. If the war continues1
through the winter the cost will prob
ably rise to a hundred milliou per day.
The interest for war loans which the
war has already Imposed on Europe's
future generations is about a billion,
two hundred million per year. Every
week the war lasts fixes an additional
annual Interest burden on the bellig
erents of twenty-five million.
Colossal taxation will have to be
Imposed on tho soldiers when they
return home after peace is declared.
The belligerents will be bowed be
neath the burdens of the war debts.
The Germans for a time this year be
lieve-l It might be possible for them
to evade their cost of the conflict by
compelling tho Quadruple Entente
powers to pay a full indemnity. Dr.
Helfferich, the German minister or
finance, made this statement in the
Reichstag lait August. But as the
year's fighting continued with con
stantly Increasing expenditures, the
German government changed its mind
about the possibility of any belliger
ent being able to escape from tho
financial net. Dr. Helfferich there
fore, announced s fortnight aso that
although Germany might collect an
Indemnity, yet the warwould Impose
'a colossal burden" of new taxes on
tho Germans,
During tho year, various British
statesmen uttered warnings concern
ing the financial outlook. And the
possibility of bankruptcy overtaking
Europe has several times been men
Honed In the house of lords. All tnc
belligerent governments have become
uneasy about tho monetary outlook,
but the -system of running the war on
borrowed money has prevented the
people themselves fro'D feeling the
financial pinch, except In Great Brit
ain. The British government is now
raising about five hundred million per
year for war costs by direct taxation;
l)ut no other uation has as yet seri
ously Increased Its peace taxes. The
British tax, laige as it is, does no
more than meet the Interest on the
government's war borrowfngs.
Tho war has com polled the rapid
expenditure of such unprecedented
sums of money that it's difficult to
believe the warring governments will
continue the strain for another year
(unless one side or the other sees the
possibility of a complete victory. No
decisive success for anybody is now
In sight. Even If either group of
belligerents has the power to force
tbo other Into bankruptcy, it is not
probable that power will be applied.
The Injury which would be done to
the most robust of the warring na
tions would not justify the infliction
enemy.
France is leading the other nations
in taking preliminary Bteps to recover
from the financial blight of the war.
The northern area ofc France now iu
the enemy's possession is one of
Europe's most important manufactur
ing centers. The factories will have
to be rebuilt and new machinery must
be installed, after peace is declared.
