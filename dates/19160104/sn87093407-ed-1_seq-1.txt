■ breach in relation* with the central power* Incomes neces
sary ;is a result of the wholesale .slaughter of non-combatants
within the Mediterranean "death zone" recently.
After these conferences, it v»as stated that no action will
be taken until further detail* of the I'ersia case are at hand.
However, the intensity and delicacy of the situation per
meated the White ll<»use, the state department, congress,
and diplomatic circles On every hand, the talk showed that
authorities looked at the recent torpedoing*, following 50
closely on Austria's Ancona note, as presenting an ominous
situation.
A s|>eeial tram returned the president from llot Springs
shortly before # o'clock
Congress reassembled at noon and promised to take a
prominent part in the international denouement. A battery
of speechmaker* threatened to turn their verbal guns upon
the international situation.
May Protest Wholesale Slaughter by "Subs"
I'"rum al! quarters came indication- that prompt, decisive
salutary -tep* to stop illegal submarine attacks arc under
wP.
*In addition to torpedoing <>f the Persia last week with
10-- «>f at least one American life, the administration is con
fronted \*ith diplomatic issue- arising from the submarining
of the < ilengyle, the Ya-ka Maru. the t'iotat, Ancona and
I.usitania. The principal point for immediate consideration
was whether the administration should protest the recent
wholesale slaughter m the Mediterranean without waiting
for further information surrounding the -inking of the Persia.
It was intimated a formal inquiry will he made of the
< eniral powers, demanding an explanation of the recent at
ta< ks.
After hi< conference with the president. Sen. Stone
declared that the administration at pre-ent lacks facts con
cerning the Per-ia, anil that nothing will he done until these
are obtained He told the president concerning the plans
of different member- of the foreign committee to delve into
the international situation
As the re-ult of their conferences with the president,
Stone and H 1 prepared to prevent discussion of interna
tional problems on the floors of congress. Adjournment of
the senate ea-ed this ta-k, inasmuch as several there were
primed for a verbal explosion
The president and the chairmen discussed all eventuali
ties. The freest consultation and co-operation between con
gress and the White House was assured if breaking of
relations becomes necessary.
Evidence on Persia Is Not Conclusive
Officials do not regard evidence thus far at hand in the
Persia case as conclusive of torpedoing. Navy authorities
ay that possibly -he -truck a mine, and as support of tlii.s
theory they pointed to the fact that the quick plunge she
took made the torpedoing theory somewhat doubtful.
The presence of. guns aboard the Persia complicates
future rather than immediate action.
The main fart of no warning remains. It is improbable
that a submarine could see gun* on tbe Persia, and whether
these were for defensive or offensive action is a question
for future discussion.
Further evidence that American Consul McXeely lost
his life in the sinking of the liner Persia. and that the ves
sel was attacked without warning, came today in a report
to the Mate department by Consul ( ieneral Skinner.
He said the admiralty's lists of survivors did not include
McXeely, tho it did include ( has H. (irant of Boston.
Seven Hindu members of the crew, clinging to an over
turned boat, were rescued by the steamer Hitig I how.
Survivors declared the attack was without warning.
Skinner said
Hymn Ri»e Above Scream* of Victims
The sound of hymns rose from those in the lifeboats,
above the screams of women and children as survivors strug
gled in the water alongside the Persia, Charles H. (irant of
Boston said today at Alexandria, according to press dis
patches.
(irant, like many others, was at luncheon, he said, when
there came a sudden explosion. In orderly manner the pas
sengers went on deck. The starboard boats could not be
put overside because of the lifting.
(irant himself slid off the ship, entangling his foot in
a rope as he went, but jerking it loose.
lie finally was picked up and then, after rowing around
some time, was taken aboard bv a British cruiser and taken
to Alexandria. He indicated that the vessel sank with great
i apidity.
