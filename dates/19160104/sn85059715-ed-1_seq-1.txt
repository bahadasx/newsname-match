consuls are gathering elsewhere to
establish the nationality or tne suumarine,

the Persia and to develop the facts

PROMINENCE
In Great Britain as a Result of
Food Blockade against
Germany.
(Correspondence of the Associated Press.)
LC'XDOX, Jan. 4.?Discussion of the
food blockade against Germany lias
served to bring attention to the merits
of the soja bean, to which is given up
more than twenty-five per cent of the
cultivated area in Manclturla. Al
inougn ine soja is wen Known aou
highly regarded in Germany and the
Scandinavian countries and is now
the second on the list of China's exports,
It lias hitherto achieved small
general reputation In the Englishspeaking
countries, and-even the latest
dlstlonarlcs dismiss It with the brief
description: "In Asiatic leguminous
herb, Glycine Soja, the seeds of which
are used to prepare sauce called soy."
Although the Chinese have used the
soja bean extensively for at least two
thousand years, the first important
shipment to Europe was made In 1908,
hy a British firm. The Germans almost
Immediately began to experiment
with It and five years later were using
the major part of an Importation estimated
at over 8200,000,000 a year.
The secret of the soja hcan Js Its
universal usefulness. ,A British government
report gives the following
list of soja products: "vegetable food
(like marrowfat peas): soups: meat
substitute; chocolate substitute; macaroni
preparation; flour; artificial
milk, cheese, coffee substitute, artificial
horn, biscuit and food for diabetic
L patients, sauce, meal for cattle, oils,
nil-cake for fodder, fertilizer beancake."
The same report points out that the
oil from the bean Is used In the manufacture
of the following articles:
"dynamlto and high explosives, soaps,
linoleum, rubber substitute, margarine,
paints, varnishes, toilet powder,
waterproof cloth, paper umbrollas and
lanterns, salad oil, lubricants, lamp
nil, preservative for sardines, substitute
for lard."
The pod of the soja is about two
Inches in length and the plant has an
erect stem two or three feet high.
Tliore are three principal varieties of
the bean?yellow or huangton, green
or chlngton and black or wuton. The
yellow contains more nutritive Ingredients
than the others, and this Is the
variety almost exclusively used for ex
port The quantity of nil extracted
from the beans runs as bight as nineteen
per cent of the total weight.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 4?Ail ex-j
pected attnck on tbe administration
policy and Kb course In the Bubma-'
rine crisis failed to materialize In tbe:
Senate today, when that body after
being In session less than ten minutes
adjourned until noon tomorrow.
The reason assigned for the sudden
adjournment by the leaders on
both sides was that several of the
senators, who were expected to have
business to present, did not have It
ready.
The motion on which the Sonate
adjourned, however, wna in observation
of the death of Associate Justice
Ijamar of the supreme court.
Earlier in the day Chairman Stone
of the Senate foreign relations committee
in conference with President
Wilson over the submarine crisis
told the press he had heard Intimations
that some senators were going
to assail the administration's course
and that some others were going to
attack the Mexican policy.
The International situation was
uppermost in tbe minds of members
of both Senate and House as they
reassembled today for the real work
of the session after the holiday recess.
Senator Fall, Republican, of New j
Mexico, had ready a resolution calling
on President Wilson to Inform
the Senate to what government he
proposed to accredit Henry Pratber
Fletcher, who haH been nominated
for ambassador to Mexico. He will
Introduce the resolution tomorrow
and it Is expected that It will be
made the vehicle for a general Republican
attack not on Mr. Fletcher,
but upon the administration's Mexican
policy.
SHERRY ARRESTED.
