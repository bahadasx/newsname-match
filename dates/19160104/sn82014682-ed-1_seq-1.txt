in Washington
HAWAII SHOULD SEND

WITHOUT INSTRUCTING
Territory Allowed only Two But
Situation is Favorable for
Seating Four More; Finds
Islands Have Many Strong
Friends in Both Parties
Justice Charles E. Hughes as a pos
sible Republican presidential candi
date is gaining such strength that he
may be nominated on the second bal
lot In the national -convention next
June. :'.'
. Such is the opinion of Charles A.
iiice, national committeeman for Ha
waii, who returned today from an ex-
tcnslveLmalnlau'd-trlp thM principal ob
ject of which vas to attend the Re
publican national convention In -Washington
last month.
Committeeman Rice brings back a
- whole budget of interesting Informa
tion and comment on matters political
and congressional, Perhaps the most
directly Important feature is that the
political situation calls for Hawaii to
send an unlnstructed delegation to Chi
i cago next June and furthermore to
demand the seating of a delegation of
six. Instead of th,e two at present
- allotted, i ' " - . . -.

V tioa delegations, following the row at
the Chicago convention of 1912 and
the subsequent defeat, a strong effort

Influential Republicans to cut down
the delegations in states where the Re
publican yote Is comparatively small

to Chicago In 1912 but the committee

6end Six and Make Fight
At the committee meeting last
month Committeeman Rice made a
strong and largely successful fight to
get the -delegation-restored to six.
While the committee did not feel that
It could make another change, owing
to' technicalities, leading Republicans
agreed with Mr. Rice that the wise
plan will be for Hawaii to elect six
delegated to the convention and wage
a fight, for their seating. The national
committee will meet in Washington
: the last week In May to hear contests,
and Hawaii has a. fine prospect of win
nlng its right to six delegates, if the
local representatives handle the situ
ation right

national policy. ; r
Though a numbercf important measures were introduced today ,
during the congressional sittings,' bills which under other circum
stances would have' created sensations were sent in almost unnoticed,
while the lobbies and cloak-rooms were tilled with discussions ,o4 -foreign
and domestic questions arising from the acute crisis in rela-'
tions with Austria. ; ; ; . ,.
President Wilson' has taken personal charge of the Persia case.
He callejl upon the state department and the department of justice,
for all reports -and documents bearing upon the case and upon its
ramifications which mil?ht shed licrht on the nrobleni and is devotincr
much time ii its consideration.
Early in the day there Were persistent and apparently well
founded "reports that the 'administration's foreign policy would be
under fire virtually a-s soon as the senate met the opposition being
said to have a line? of attack developed. This attack was confidently
expected to be launched today, but the shortness of the senate sos
ion prevented anything but the routine of assembly. As soon as the
senate session opened, a resolution was introduced calling for ad
journment out of respect to the memory 'of the late Justice Lamar,
who died duriner the holiday reeess. (!onsennentlv. the senate ad-
journed after being in session only ten minutes and no opportunity
was given for the heralded criticism.
That the administration leaders and the president are expecting
some attack is certain. Previous to the meeting of the senate, Sen-

senators were planning to assail the administration's course in deal

.the Lusitania, Persia anu other liners and resultant loss of American

lives would furnish the theme. Still other senators were planning
to voice a criticism of the administration's Mexican policy, said Chair
uiau oluuc. t v ' 1 "
During the day the president asked to his office in the'Whitc

given out that this important conference Avas primarily to discuss the
