lose Who Were Drowned
London, Jan. 3. Robert Key Jlc
Jleely, liie newly appointed American
tonsul at Aden; probably lost his life
when the British steamship Persia
.was torpedoed and sunk Thursday aft
ernoon. He was last seen struggling
la tho water. There fs no mention of
hla namo in any of the lists of tur
vivors so far received.
No warning was given tho Persia
beforo the torpedo was launched, ao
cording to authoritative Information.
It Is understood that Robert P. Skin
ner, American consul general here,
has information in his possession that
out of a totul of 400 passengers wid
crow on the steamer only 1C3 word
isaved. Tiiiil number of survivors has
arrived at Alexandria, Egypt. It Is
possible that a few more may be
added.
Tho number of lives lost was, there
fore, 247, making tlie Persia second
only to the Lusltania loss among the
list of passenger steamers sunk by
German and Austrian submarines. Of
the 1C3 saved only 59 were passen
gers, the others being members of the
crew.
There were eighty-seven women
among the passengers. Of these only
seventeen are known to have been
picked up. In addition, there were
thirty children. It Is feared that all
of the latter lost their lives. Charles
H. Grant or Boston, the second Ameri
can positively known to have been on
the Pc-sla, wua saved. Hla name ,
came among tho first list of survivors.
There Is some doubt as to whether
Dowd McNeely, a brother to the Amer
ican consul, at Aden, was on board. If
he was, there Is very little hope that
he was saved. His name appears In
none of the lists of survivors. There
fore 1$ Is practicaly established that
one American citizen and an official
of the United States was lost wher
the Persia went down. In addition
there 1t a possibility that another
American, 'making two In all, was
drowned.
It la affirmed that only four life
boats got away from tho Persia, a
fact which comes to Indicate beyond
doubt that the ship sank within a few
minutes after being struck. Amon!,'
those who are known to have om
barked on the Persia, but whose
names do not appear among tho
saved, are Miss 13. Thornton, private
secretary to Lord Montague, and Miss
G. E. Mac-Donald.
GARRETS' REPORT
i American Consul General Has No
Tidings of Consul McNeely.
Washington, Jan. 3. With Informa
tion at hand to show that 245 per
sons, Including United States Consul
Robert N. McNeely, prphably lobt
their lives when the DrltiBh steamer
Persia was sunk In tho eastern Medi
terranean, the hands of the Btate de
partment are temporarily tied.
Unless more detailed and positive
Information' Is obtained as -to the cir
cumstance of the attack, officials of
the stats department admitted that
the American government may never
be In a position to demand an ac
counting. Thus far on two essential
points the facts are lacking. It re
mains to be determined, they point
out:
First Whether the Persia was at
tacked by a submarine, or was sunk j
by a mine
Second Attacked by a submarine, J
whether the attacking craft was a
German, Austrian or Turkish subma
rine or of another nationality.
Until d,eflnito Information Is ob
tntnn.1 mi tlmnn two -nnlnts. declared
department officials, the American
government must bide us time anu
await the receipt of fuller report from

BoardilheJPersia

United State? Cosm Garrets at Alex
undria, who has been instructed to
get as many sworn statements as pos
sible from survivois. The first report
from Garrets was "brief but graphic.
Ii told just enough to convince official
Washington that the tragedy was sur
passedtay the list ot such Incidents
since the outbreak of the war only by
the sinking of the Lusltania. Garrets'
cable follows:
"Persia was sunk 300 miles north
west of Alexandria at live minutes
afte'r 1 o'clock on the afternoon of
Dec. 30. Steamer sank In live min
utes. No sulimurin- was seen, al
though an officer saw the wake ot the
torpedo. One hundred and llfty-ttvu

ed at Alexandria on Jan. 1. Of the
Americans on board Charles II. Grnl
of Rostnu raved. McNeely, consul at
Aden, piobably lost. He was last
seen struggling In the water."
Officials here attach no importance
to the presence of the 4.7' inch gunt
which Consul Garrets reports the Per
sia as carrying, provided it can bt
shown thy were for defensive pur
uostti only.
MANY DRIVEN FROM HOME
Towns In Northern Ohio Under Water
and Property Damaged.
Columbus, Jan. 3. Considerable
property damage was done by the
floods throughout Ohio. Several hun
dred people were driven from their
homes, but no loss of life has been
reported.
The situation In several cities, par

ported to he Ave feet under wr.ter.

mont, north ot Tiffin, were inundated
and many families In this section
were forced to move to higher ground.

factory district at Lima, on the Otta
wa river, but owing to co'.der weather
tho rain ceased and the water bdgan
to recede. Twenty families were re
moved from the flooded district by
police and firemen Lowlands about
the city were flooded. Though rivers
h: the southern part of tho state were
rising, none of them had reached the
danger matk. Many small creeks,
"nowever. were out of their banks.

PEACE MISSION
HAD GOOD EFFECT
Words Njf Henry Ford, Who
IssuesShort Statement.
HE DOESN'T HEGRET THE TRIP
Comes Back Blaming the People, Not
the Capitalists and Murltlon Mak
ers, For the Great War Bellevei
His Mission Has Started the People
to Thinking No Fighting Among
Peace Delegates, Says the Pacifist. '
Now York, Jan. 3. Henry Ford,
homo again after falling to "get the
fcoya out of the trenches by ChriU
mas," but nevertheless emphatic it.
his declaration that he did not regret
what he had done and was sure that
It had had a good effect," arrived In
this city from Norway.
His homecoming was in strong con
trast to his departure. Instead of the
blaze of bunting, and the clamor of ap
plause that sent the peace ship Oscar
I II. on her mission, the returning paci
fist waB spirited away from the ship
In a private cutter, landed at an out-of-the-way
spot and hurried in a taxlcab
to the Waldorf, where he remained
until he left for Detroit this morning.
"I went over there to show the peo
ple that I was willing to give more
than my money for the cause of
peace," Mr. Ford said. "I feel that I
am, only the custodian of my money.
It was given to me by these very peo
ple who are being slaughtered in the
trenches. I can't use any more of it
than 1 .m using now, and I want to
devote the rest to benefiting these peo
ple who helped me to earn it. I came
back because I had a slight touch of
the grip, and that hastened me a bit,
but when I left New York I told .Mrs.
Ford that I would return in about five
weeks. How do Lfeel now? Finely."
When asked what impressions he
brought back from the war, Mr. Ford
astonished his listeners by declaring
sadly:
"I went to Europe blaming the capi
talists, the bankers, the munitions
makers, for this war; I have como
back blaming the people the very
people who are being slaughtered in
the trenches. They have neglected to
select the proper heads for their gov
ernments, or to help them after they
have been selected. When they get a
man In office they do not keep in
touch with him; they don't tell him
what they want. They select people
tr govern them and then allow the
militarists to twist these same people
about for their own ends." N
Not His Own Idea.
At this point Mr. Ford paused to ex
plain emphatically that the voyage of
the Oscar II. was not really his own
private venture or id-Ja at all, but a
part of the Woman's International
Peace Congress which to be held at
the Hague. "T'ie Idea Is not mine at
all," he declared. "Tho fact, is that I
am merely using my money In a good
cause to finance the congress. The
people who sailed with me on the Os
car II. are going to elect delegates
who will go on to tbe Hague, while
the rest will return soon to this coun
try. I have beon advised that a ship
has been chartered to take the dele
gates to Holland.'
"Do I think we have accomplished
anything? Yes, I do. We have start
ed the people to talking. When the
people start thinking they think right,
end something good comes of It. For
that reason I like the adverse criti
cism that the papers have given me.
The only thing that has been disa
greeable to me Is that It worried my
wife. My son Is of a different frame
or mind. It doesn't bother him. If all
the newspapers got together and de
manded that the war be stopped and
made the people realize what U,
Jieans to them, public oplnon would
stop It pretty quickly."
Mr. Ford denied flatly that there
was any fighting among the peace
delegates. "There was a difference of
opinion, many times," he admlted,
"lust as there would be at a church
convention or a political convention,
of In a village. You must remember
that the group we took over was vir
tually a community."
William J. Bryan visited Mr. Ford
and expressed his congratulations.
Mr. Bryan said: "I think the peace
expedition has achieved a great deal
of -success. It had been a partial suc
cess, even before Mr. Ford sailed, for
themere discussion of peace that it
started was an advantage."
