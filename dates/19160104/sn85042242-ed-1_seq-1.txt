[Most Noted of Upper Missouri
River Captains Succumbs to
Pneumonia.
BROUGHT WOUNDED HERE
FROM. PUSTER MASSACRE
p^gWas Close Personal Friend of
Custer, '/Buffalo,Bill" Cody
and 'Mark Twain."
Death, late Sunday afternoon,
claimcd Captain Grant" Prince Marsh,
ill aged 82, the oldest and by far the
most interesting pioneer of river nav­
igation in the country.
Captain Marsh was taken tp the
St. lAlexius hospital Saturday, suffer­
ing from a severe attack of pneumo­
nia, and at 4:20 o'clock Sunday after­
noon life ebbed away from the man
whose career as a steamboat man on
the great rivers of the country cov­
ers a period of 70 years, the greater
part of which has been spent on the
"Great Muddy," whose tawny waters
lie loved, and whose ways and wiles
be knew as no other man..
Born in Pennsylvania.
•Captain Marsh was born in Warren
'County, Pa., IMay 11, 18^4, and later
moved with his parents to New York
state, where he lived for several
years. .He first began Ills river ca­
reer, when as a boy of 12 he applied
to Captain Alfred Reno, of the steam­
er Dover, for a position, lie shipped
ffrom Pittsburg 011 the Dover as cab­
in boy, and began the first of his
^hundreds of river trips on all the
I great rivers of the country, trips
which carried aim from the hustle
land bustle of \New Orleans, St. iLouis
jand Pittsburg levees to. the heart of
^the great. Indian eouutry bordering
the banks of the upper Missouri.
In the early spring of 18M, he se­
cured a position as deckhand on the
iPittsburgrSt*. Louis...Packet, "Beaver,"
and caught his first glimpse of the
Mississippi river, on his first trip.
St. Louie, then a city of 95,000 people,
with
110
railroad connections with the
outside world, was then in the grip
of a cholera scourge.
Fif-st Missouri Trip.
The first trip 011 the Missouri,
"which later proved to be the scene of
•his many adventures, was made as a
deckhand, on the iF. X. Aubrey, com­
manded by Captain Ambrose Reeder,
and making the run between St. Lou­
is and St. Joseph, Mo. Practically
all the commerce of the Missouri and
Mississippi valleys at. that time was
handled by river boats, and there
was plenty for them all to do.
During the winter or '55 and '56 he
remained on the steamer "A. B.
Chambers," where he went after
working for a year on the "Aubrey"
lie acted as watchman on the "Cham­
bers", while the steamer along with
hundreds of others was "frozen in"
at St. Louis. On February 27 a thaw
came and a rapid rise in the river
followed. The memorable ice gorge
of '56 then swept boat after boat
down the river to destruction. The
"Chambers" was but slightly damag­
ed. Captain Marsh stuck to the boat,
expecting momentarily to be killed
by the splintering wreckage along
the levee. The boat lodged against
the wall of the United States arsenal
however, and he found himself safe.
Mate On "Alonzo Child."
The following year Captain Marsh
was enrolled as mate on the side
wheeler packet "Alonzo Child," un­
der Captain Joe Holland, and made
his first trip to Omaha, Neb. Omaha
was then the outfitting place for gold
seekers and immigrants headed for
the far west, and was regarded as one
of the toughest of the frontier towns.
It was also the lendezvous of cara­
vans of Mormons moving toward
their promised land surrounding the
Great Salt Lake.
In -he fall of 1857 Captain Marsh
left Ouiaha as .mtfij) on the steamer
'Hesperian," which later returned to
St. Louis with its cargo because of
the financial panic, and the flooding
of the country with worthless paper
money, the merchats being unable to
pay for their merchandise.
"Mark Twain's" Friend.
He worked on the lower Mississip­
pi the following season as mate of
the "A. B. Chambers No.
season none other than Sam Clemens,
"Mark Twain," most beloved of Amer­
ican humorists, worked under Cap­
tain Marsh as second pilot. The
friendship formed between the two at
that time lasted until the death of
"Mark Twain."
The crew of the Chambers exper­
ienced any number of difficulties that
season, one of theui be.ng caught in
an ice jam. Mark Twain remember­
ed the incidents to the day of his
death, as did Captain Marsh.
Captain Marsh was married in
18«1 at St. Louis. Four childlren
survive at the present time. Mrs.
Marsh having succumbed about five
years ago. The chi'dre.* are Captain
John P.. Marsh. Omaha, Neb.: Captain
Grant C. Marsh. Jr., St. Louis, Mo.
Mrs. R. S. Albert, Redwood City, Cal.

Has a New
Disturber
Chicago, Jan. 3.—James Pugh, for­
mer commodore of the Chicago Yacht
club, who has been co-operating with
the officials of the navy department,
in connection with plans for a fleet
of motor boats, to act as submarine
destroyers, received today plans for
a new cruiser to be known as Dis­
turber Six.
Commodore Pugh is owner of Dis­
turber Four, said to be the fastest,
motor boat in the world. The plans
received today provide for a displace­
ment boat, 30 feet long with a beam
of five feet, designed to carry a three
inch disappearing gun and a torpedo
tube, and to develop a speed of 50
miles an hour. The boat will use
gasoline for fuel, with the exhaust
silenced and will have a cruising rad­
ius of 10,000 miles, with accommoda­
tions for ten persons. Its cost is es­
timated at $50,000.

EUROPEAN WAR MEANS
the Two Greatest World
Powers.
•"Washington, Jan. 15.—An army aim
navy capable of successfully resist­
ing attacks upon any portion of the
coast of the United States, Central
or South America, not only by an
single foreign power, but by any two
such powers in alliance, are the ulti­
mate aims of the army and navy
strategists who formulated plans for
national defense, it was learned to­
night.
They believe, it is said, that an ad­
equate military policy must pro\ id
against assaults by either a .Europe­
an or an Asiatic power, or an alliance
of two such powers, which might
seek to attack the new Monroe Doc­
trine. Their plans would provide suf­
ficient force to enable the United
States to act alone with no entan­
gling alliances in case of such at­
tacks.
Biggest Navy Urgecf.
Such a force, they say, would re­
quire a navy equal to those of any
two world powers, excluding Great
Britain, and an army large enough
that a portion could be used in any
Central or South American country
without impairing the safety of the
United States itself.
The navy board believes the shock
of the present war will assure the
Americas of any colonial or trade ag

SINKING 0? PERSIA
BEING INVESTGATED
Matter Will Be Taken Up by the

•-.'UTjv.r
Committee.
Washington, Jan. President
Wilson atavied to Washington from
11 lot Springs, Va.,-tonight lo take pei
sonal charge of the nation's foreign
affairs in tlie new crisis brought
about by the sinking of the British
steamship, Persia, with a loss of ai
least one American .ljfo. The situa­
tion is regarded in official .circles as
being the most seriou- lo confront
the government since the submarine
operations of the Central l'owers be­
gan.
The president probably will lay the
facts thus far established before his
cabinet tomorrow. The destruction
of the Persia, following closely upon
the crisis precipitated by the Ancona
disaster, may result in the United
States determining to settle immedi­
ately all the questions involved in
th^ submarine warfare. The subject1
is expected to find its way: to the
floor of Ihe house and senate tomor­
row.-, wnen congress reconvenes.
Cuts Honeymoon Short.
iProsidonl Wilson decided to cut
short his honeymoon and return to
the capital at once after telephone
conferences with Secretary Lansing
and Mr. Tumulty, his private secre­
tary. He should arrive here at 7
o'clock tomorrow morning.
The United.States is determined to
take any action that, the facts -con­
cerning the lEersia may warrant, it
was represented tonight. Officials
are trying to view tlie situation with
an open mind, but il is apparent that
I hey are disturbed by the reports re­
ceived from consular agents at Alex­
andria and Cairo. Egypt. Every ei
fort will be made to establish t.:c,
truth of the report that the Persia
was torpedoed without warning. Sec­
retary Lansing contemplates taking
110 steps until the complete details
are known.
Making Inquiries.
OHicials find one source of gratifi­
cation in assurances given by the
charge of the Austro-Hungarian em­
bassy
to Secretary Lansing during
a conference today at Ihe state de­
partment. He is said to have assur­
ed the secretary of his belief that
an Austrian submarine commander
violated the principle, of internation­
al law and the rules of humanity his
government would be quick to satisfy
the. t'nited States.
Secretary Lansing today instructed
Ambassador Penlinld at Vienna to
make informal inquiries there con­
cerning the sinking of the Persia.
The secretary acted under an indi­
cation received from an undisclosed
source that only Austrian submarines
were known to be operating-near t*ic
point where the Persia went down.

Influenza
Spreading
Over U. S.
Washington, Jan. 3.—Influenza is
spreading over the United States,
from coast to coast., in the most seri­
ous epidemic ever known, taking a
large toll of lives. iReporis from pub­
lic health service officers, made pub­
lic tonight by Surgeon General Blue,
show that already the disease has
created a great problem for many ot
the larger cities and is spreading to
the rural communities. New York.
Chicago. Philadelphia, Doston. San
Francisco, Seattle, Cleveland and De­
troit reported the disease widely
prevalent. Cleveland and Detroit,
each have probably 100,(100 cases. Of
the larger cities, Buffalo, Pittsburg,
Laltimore, San Diego, Dallas and Mo­
bile reported 110 signs of an epidemic.
There Is practically nothing the
federal government -can do in aiding
the suppression of tuc epidemic. The
situation must be dealt with by local
authorities, and they, in turn, it is
explained, are almost helpless with­
out co-operation from the public.
Surgeon General iBlue said tonight
he had called for reports from an
parts of. the country with the hope
that publicity would tend to stimu­
late this co-operatioii.

Washington, Jan. :i.—Congress re­

Returning members talked little of
the consequences that might result
from the sinking of the "Persia" with
loss of American lives, and the strain­
ed diplomatic relations between the
United States and Austria.
Al'hough administration leaders

of uneasiness among senators and
reprcsetatives over the gravity of for­

seek a conference with President
Wilson before tlie meeting of the
