Experience In Louisville and throughout the country shows that this com

Deafness Cannot be Cored
bjr local applications, a J they cannot reach tht
dlieaied portion ot the ear, There li onlr one
war to cure deafaeu, and that Ib constitution
al remedies. Deafness li canted by an Inflamed
condition ot the mucous lining ot the Eustachian
Tube. When this tube Is Inflamed yon save a
rumbling sound or Imperfect bearing, and when
It Is entirely closed, deafness is the result, and
unless the inflammation can be taken out and
this tube restored to Its normal condition, hearing
will be destroyed forever; nine cases out of ten
are caused by Catarrh, which is nothing but an
Inflamed condition of tbe mucous surface.
We will give One Hundred Dollars for any case
of Deafness (caused by catarrh) that cannot be
cured by Hall's Catarrh Cure. Send for circu

American Dramatic
Formula No Longer
Spells Success
In the January American Mag'
azine Walter Prichard Eaton says
about tne Broadway managers
ideal prodnotion:
'A resourceful, up-to-the-minute
young hero, chuck full of
slang and with an extremely
wabbly ethical sense, cleans up
a fortune, wins the best girl
around tho place, tweaks the
villian's nose, lolls in the lime
light, and in the last act has a
change of morals for purely the
atrical purposes, and is supposed
to be a saint when the curtain
falle but never a poor saint, bo
it uoted. The formula has been
extremely popular with the
American public, both on the
state and in magazines, for the
publ c seems always ready to ac
cept anybody as a hero who oun
"oleau up." But it is baginuiug
to wear a bit thin, none the
less."
Tho Gist of It
"Last Dtcomber I had a vary se
vere oold aud was nearly down sick
In bed. I bought two bottles of
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy and
It was only a very few days until I
was completely restored tu Health,"
writes O. J. Metoalf, Weatherby,

of this remedy, ask anyone who lias
used It. Obtainable everywhere.
