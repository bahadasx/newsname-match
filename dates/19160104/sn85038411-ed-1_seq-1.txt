Hy Associated Press
Washington. D. C.. Jan. 4. Offi
cial announcement that the govern
ment will act in the newest phase of
the submarine crisis brought on by
the sinking of the Persia was made
to-day at the White House.
Secretary Tumulty issued this state
ment for the President:
"The President and the Secre
tary of State arc taking every
means possible to obtain the full
facts in this grave matter and
will act just as soon as the in
formation is obtained."
In the absence of detailed and
specific information on which to base
ihe next step. President Wilson can
| celled the cabinet meeting which was
' to have been held to-day, but con
ferred with Chairman Stone and some
members of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee. Chairman Stone
told the President there were inti
mations that some senators ware -pre
paring to make speeches on the sink
ing of ships with loss of American
life. The President is understood to
have simply replied that the adminis
tration was doing all it could to pro
tect American rights.
The President instructed Secretary
"Lansing to bring immediately to the
White House any new information
which came to .hand and then busied
himself reading the official dispatches
so far received, and getting in touch
generally with the situation.
The Administration is depending
largely on the inquiries which Am
bassador Pentield has been instructed
to make at Vienna and that which
consuls are gathering elsewhere, to
establish the nationality of the sub-!
marine which is said to have sunk
the Persia and to develop the facts in j
the case generally.
Congress Meets
Amid Uneasiness
Washington. Jan. 4. Congress re- i
assembled to-day, after the holiday'
recess, with the nation's foreign affairs
uppermost in the minds of members of
the two houses. On all sides the in
ternational situation was admitted to
be the gravest the country yet has
faced.
Issues growing out of the subma
rine warfare of Germany and Aus
tria and Great Britain's interference
with neutral commerce, figured chiefly
in the discussions of senators and rep
resentatives. The situation has caused
a general feeling of uneasiness among
them. I
Although the international situation
holds for the moment chief interest in
Congress, it was believed that the ques
tion of national preparedness would
be taken up at once.
It seemed assured also that the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee
would take up promptly Senator Hoke
Smith's resolution providing for an in
quiry into British interference with
neutral commerce and Senator Lodge's
amendment calling for an inquiry into!
the Lusitania disaster and other acts
of belligerents resulting in the loss of
American lives.

By Associated Press
Alexandria, Egypt. Jan. 4, via Lon
|<lon, 10.30 a. m.—Charles Grant of
! lloston, one of the two Americans
i known to have been on obard the Brit
ish steamship Persia when she was
■ torpedoed in the Mediterranean last
Thursday has arrived in Alexandria,
j Mr. Grant, so far as is known, is the
only American from whom can come
| the story of the Persia's sinking. He
jgave to the Associated Press to-day
i tlie most detailed account yet received
iof the disaster.
j "I was in the dining saloon of the
I Persian at 1.05 p. in.," he said. "I had
just finished my soup and the steward
I was'asking what I'would take for my
(second course when a terrific explosion
[ occurred.
"The saloon became filled with
I smoke, broken glass and steam from
I the boiler, which appeared to have
burst. There was no panic on board.
We went on deck as though we were
'at drill and reported at the lifeboats
jon the starboard side, as the vessel
| had listed to port. I clung to the rail
ting. The lhst thing done was to tie
lon Captain Spriekly's life lielt.
"As the vessel was then listing so
badly that it was impossible to launch
the starboard boats I slid down the
starboard rail into the water. I got
caught in a rope which pulled off a
shoe, but 1 broke loose and climbed on
! some flouting wreckage, to which I
I clung.
"The last T saw of the Persia she
Iliad her bow in the air; five minutes
after the explosion.
Scene Was Horrible
' "After floating about on the wreck
lage until 4 o'clock in the morning 1
[saw five boats. I was pulled into one
of them. We rowed about looking for
other stragglers.
"The boats became overloaded and
the occupants were redistributed.
Four boats were tied together by their
painters and the fifth followed some
distance away.
"My boat left the others in order to
search the more frequented steamship
channels for help. We rowed" for
three hours. When we saw a cruiser
and called out: 'We are English.'
We explained that we were survivors
of the Persia and gave directions to
the cruiser as to where the other boats
were. They wer§ found and the occu
pants were taken off immediately by
the English sailors.
"Robert McNeely, American consul
at Aden, sat at the same table with
me on the voyage. He was not seen,
probably because his cabin was on the
port side.
"It was a horrible scene. The wa
ter was black as ink. Some passengers
were screaming, other were calling out
good-by. Those In one boat sang
hymns."
Name of American
Consul Is Not on List
By Associated Press
Washington, Jan. 4.—Consul Gen
eral Skinner at London to-day advised
the State Department that the tele
grahphic list of survivors of the torpe
doed liner Persia received there from
Alexandria did not include the name
of Robert X. McNeely, American con
sul at Aden, but does include Charles
Grant, of Boston.
Eleven survivors, including Lord
Montagu have been landed at Malta,
according to advices to the State De
partment from American Consul Keb
linger. His dispatch said seven In
dians of the Persia's crew had been
found clinging to a damaged open boat
by the steamship Hingchow. All the
men said the Persia had been torpe
doed without warning.
Remarkable Expansion
Shown in Trade Balance
Wheat grown in the United States in
1911 and marketed in 191,5 was of no
higher grade than previous crops;
manufacturers of shoes and machinery |
and chemicals discovered no new ways :
of entering foreign markets In compe- '
tition with other nations. Yet the bai- 1
ance of trade In this countrv's favor i
was in the neighborhood of 5i.800.000 - '
000 last year, as against less than $200.'- I
000.00 in 1914.
The explanation lies, of course. In the '■
war. When that broke out the ten- i
rlency of international trade was '
against us. Had there been continued 1
peace in Europe it is quite likelv that
the change in tariff policy would have!
necessitated shipments of gold from the
United States to Kurope to settle trade
balances. War threw the complicated i
machinery of International trade out

Austrian Residents Fear
They Were Flimflammed
j Austrian residents who recently sub
scribed to "a foreign war loan," were
j to-day a little anxious about the

! secured between $3,000 and $5,0001
j here. The subscribers were to receive

Iday, brought Inquiries at the police
j station.
j Joseph P. Thompson, acting chief of
I the police, said he had about a dozen
(callers. According to the stories told,
jthe agents said they represented the
j Austrian government. They had plen
!ty of Austrian bank notes, and dis
posed of them at the rate. of 100
"kroner" for sl4. The real value in
j United States money is said to be S2O,
land in addition the contributors are to

SECRETARY KNOX
IS FAVORED FOR
U. S. SENATORSHIP
•
( Former Senator Gains inPopu
lar Support to Succeed
Oliver Next Year
FRIENDS ARE ACTIVE
Petitions Roaring His Name
Expected to Re Circulated
Before Very Long
1 Men from various sections of Penn
sylvania who have been at the State
Capitol on business with the several
departments and other branches of
the State Government in the last fort
night are of the opinion that the senti
ment of the voters of the Keystone
State is rapidly turning toward Phil
ander C. Knox, former Secretary of
State and Attorney General, for the
United States Senatorship to succeed
Senator George T. Oliver, of Pitts
burgh, who will not be a candidate
again.
It is understood that Senator Oliver,
who will complete his six years next
winter, desires to retire. The Senator
is a man of wide interests and is be
sides the owner of two of the biggest
newspapers of the State, In which he
takes a great and justitiable pride. He
has been an indefatigable worker in
the Senate and has several times
brought to the attention of the Upper
House the interests of this Common
wealth in a forceful manner. Many
of his friends would like to see htm
continue as Senator, but he is said
to prefer private life and the direc
tion of his business, especially his
newspapers.
Knox to the Front
Mr. Knox was chosen to succeed the
late Senator Quay and speedily be
came such a commanding figure in
the Senate that he was asked into the
cabinet as Secretary of State, Mr. Oli
ver succeeding him. lie was Pennsyl
vania's choice for the Presidency in
1908 and since the Democratic na
tional administration began at Wash
ington he has been much in the pub
lic eye because of the contrast be
tween his tenure of the State portfolio
and what followed him.
Several times the name of Mr. Knox
has been brought out in speeches and
while he has made no announcement
his friends have been active in his be
half and have noted a gradual growth
of sentiment in his favor for Senator.
This has cropped out in many unex
pected places and it has been stated
here by men of experience in politics
that if he enters the Senatorial pri
mary he will sweep the State.
For a time Senator William E.
Crow was mentioned as a candidate
for Senator, but he let it be known
some time ago that he would not con
sider it. being occupied with business
matters which require all of his at
tention.
Will Circulate Petitions
Unless Mr. Knox objects it is prob
able that many of his friends will
make an effort for his nomination and
the indications are that petitions bear
ing his name will appear when the
time for signing such papers rolls
around a few months hence.
That the Senator would be a splen
did representative for this State, in
view of his experience and knowledge
of its interests is conceded and his in
| herent strength before the people is
I rapidly being recognized.
BIBLE AND ONION
DECORATE FOUR
AMERICAN FLAGS
Police Called to End Insult to
Nation's Emblem; Nearly
Causes Riot
Four United States flags, to each of
which was attached a large Bermuda
onion, this morning floated from the
windows of the home of Harry C.
Staub, 325 Delaware street. In the
center of the flags, hanging to a cord,
was a family Bible.
This unusual display came nearly
causing a riot in the vicinity of the
Staub home. Neighbors thought it
was an insult to the flag to have onions
attached. The police department was
requested to send officers and have the
objectionable display removed. Paul
Fetrow, motorcycle officer, was sent
to the Staub home, demanded an ex
planation, and ordered the decorations
removed.
| "It takes opions to make people
cry," said Mrs. Staub, wlien asked for
ian explanation. "I am simply dem
onstrating my feelings over the dc-
I purture of a neighbor," she continued,
j "It is a way I have to let the neighbors
know what is going on." Mrs. Staub
said. She then told this story to
Patrolman Fetrow:
"Mrs. Martin Dengler, who resides
at 1921 Moltlce street, is going to move
out. For many weeks it has been a
daily fight between her children and
my children. I heard the Denglers
were going to leave the neighborhood,
so 1 decided to celebrate. I did not ex
pect to cause so much excitement. I
am glad they are going.
"I am an American citizen and I
love the flag. The Denglers thought
there would be tears shed if they left
this community. Onions make peo
ple cry. The Bible is my help. It
shows I trust in God, and want to be
a peaceable neighbor; but alas! some
times it is impossible. Everybody
knows why they were there, so I am
satisfied."
Patrolman Fetrow said there had
been numerous quarrels between the
Denglers and Staubs.

the west side of St. Patrick's Cath

PASSENGERS ARE SAFE
300 Placed on Pari is Before
Accident; Help Is Speed
ing Toward Her
By Associated Press
New York, Jan. 4. The Greek j
fteamer Thessaloniki which was be-|
ins towed toward New York by the I
steamer Patris was again adrift in a
sale 300 miles east southeast of New
York early to-day, her tow line hav
ing parted during the night. Wire
less messages sent by the Thessaloniki,
to other steamers asking aid told
shore stations her plight.
The Thessaloniki has been disabled
and virtually adrift for about ten
days. It was first reported that her
enginerooms were flooded. Yesterday
word came that her 300 passengers
had been transferred to the Patris
which then took the crippled steamer
in tow.
The first message telling of the
breaking of the tow line was received
at 2:15 o'clock this morning. It gave
her position and said that the steamer
had no means of aiding herself. Dis
tress signals had been sent out, the
message stated, and the steamers
Finland f>nd .Stockholm were reported
to be "standing by." Soon afterward
a message sent by the captain of the
Thessaloniki to the Stockholm was
overheard by wireless stations on
shore. The captain asked the Stock
holm to come to his aid and to tow
the Thessaloniki to New York.
I.incrs Speeding to Her
The Stockholm was believed to be
about fifty miles from the Thessal
oniki at that time while the steamer
United States, which also picked up
the Thessaionilti's S. O. S. calls, was
145 miles distant.
A radio message received here
early to-day from the Scandinavian
line steamship United States said that
steamer had turned from her course
and headed toward the Thessaloniki.
The captain said he would confine his
efforts to aiding the passengers and
crew of the disabled Greek steamer
as the prevailing northwest gale would
make it impossible to tow the Thessa
loniki. At seven o'clock this morning
it was thought that the United States
was about 100 miles from the Thessa
loniki. ,
A radio message from the captain
of the steamer United States at !»: 44
a. m. says that his vessel was then 75
miles from the Thessaloniki and was
proceeding at fifteen knots an hour.
A northwest gale which raged all
night had materially abated.

NEW DIRECTORS
TO INVESTIGATE
REFORM BOARD ?
New Poor Directorate "Curi
ous" as to Some of Old Offi
cials' Transactions
Dauphin county's new poor directors
may do a little investigating of cer
tain "reform" transactions of their
predecessors when the new body meets
to-morrow, according to J. William
Bayles, the new poor clerk.
Some of the items of expense in
the old poor board's estimates are not
quite clear to the new directorate.
For instance, according to Mr.
Bayles, the card index record shows
that the old poor board has been
regularly contributing county support,
to at least one woman who is now
confined In the county jail; in other
instances, he said, men of the type
that are better known as "panhan
dlers" are believed to have been re
ceiving help from the board.
Another matter that the new direc
torate is as yet very curious about, the
clerk pointed out. is the item of sal
ary for a nurse of the Visiting Nurse
Association. This provision, he ex
plained, is included in the statement
turned over to him by the old poor
board. The item in question calls for
a payment of SSO per month to the
Visiting Nurse Association for "a*wel
fare nurse maintenance and salary."
The regular salary of the association
nurses, Mr. Bayles said, is only S7O
per month.
The first contagious disease case to
j be handled by the new board was re
j moved to the almshouse yesterday aft
| ernoon at the request of Dr. J. M J.
Kaunick, the. city health officer. The
I patient is May Sutch, of 1304 Wal
lace street, who is suffering with
I diphtheria. Twelve others, including
I men and several women, were living
| in the house, Mr. Ba.vles said,
t In discussing the report that Miss
Katherine Wells had quit as super
vising nurse at the almshouse be
cause she was dissatisfied at the
change of administration, Mr. Bayies
stated to-day that Miss Wells had re
signed more than a week ago and Miss
Margaret Uhman, a graduate of the
Polyclinic Hospital, Philadelphia, had
been chosen to succeed her. Miss El
len Grove has not resigned as house
keeper, he said, although she has been i
talking of quitting.
