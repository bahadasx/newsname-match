maintained her had as an oil-producing
state over Oklahoma, of !t,000,

Preliminary estimates of the total
yield of petroleum for nil", indicate
a slight increase over tile record
breaking production of 1914, al
though this condition does not agree
with the currently reported reason for
the exceptional high prices now pre
vailing for motor fuel. Ttiis may be
accounted for. however, by reason of
the fact that while the rushing field
in Oklahoma1 largely augmented the
petroleum yield in Oklahoma several
months ago, the production at Cuih

FOR the first time in the history of
Tulsa the board of education last
night awarded the contract for the
construction of u school building to
other than the low bidder.
The Brlckner & Van Horn Co, of
Tulsa was given the contract for the
construct:,,,-! of the high school, at
$391,000
Their hid was made public for the
first time, and it developed that they
had not submitted a blanket bid at
nil but had bid mi the various items
separately.
Their bid on the general construc
tion was $289,498, or $10,000 lower
than tin. King Lumber company of
Virginia, Their bid on the plumbing
was Si::'. Dun, or $2,000 more than the
lowest bidder and their bid on tie'
electrical work was $10,000, the only
Item on which their bid was low.
Tile contrail for the heating and
Ventilation was not awarded. The
Mo-Man oampany of Kansas City had
the low bill on this division, but it
was rejected on account of some trou
ble thev had in performing a school
contract here several years ago. The
board received a telegram from this
concern yesterday stating that the
company was reorganized three years
ago and they desired a hearing as to
their responsibility, No action was
taken on the telegram and new bids
on heating and ventilation will he
advertised for.
The meeting was notable for the
