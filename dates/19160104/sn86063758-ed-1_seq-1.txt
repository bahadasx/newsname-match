Lugoff, Jan. 1.?That the farmers of |
South Carolina ire closely and thor- |
ouerhly studying economic questions: i
t:hat they are teginning to face the
? . which| confront them in a
iusiness-nke niriner, and that they
are in^earnest n an attempt to get
\ogether and sund together, for the
protection of th fruits of their labor
v;as strikingly evidenced at a public
gathering of theFarmers' Secret association,
held atlPine Grove school
house, near herl in Kersha'-v county,
today. The mfi-ng, which was attended
by between />&and 600 of Ker

From time tc time items in regard
to this Farmers' Secreta association,
which is spreading ove*. Sr*th Carolina,
have creppinto the newspapers.
Yery little in regard to it is known
by those outside the circle, however,
:or it seems t> live up to its name,
Emitting only those who are eligible,
and then scing about its business iif a
systematic way, and keeping its affairs
ig itself. The Mon. Newton Kelly, who
presided o?*er the meeting and introduced
the'SUta'^ers tcfeily, said that the
[.association* this community began
with three members, of which he was
one, and that the local lodge nownumbered
nicie than one hundred
farmers, the membership having grown
to this ntfrnb^r without any special
effort on the" part of any one. the members
having come involuntarily.

4zed as one of the lost advanced steps
which had been taen by any state in
the South since th- War Between t'ne
States. The last Igislature, he said,
tried to -kill it, notbecause they wrere
prejudiced against he warehouse system,
because they Hew in their hearts
that it was a goodthing, but "on account
of political eeling against the

Former Governor Blejse.
t Former Governor Blease began his
address by saying that the ^formers as
as other classes ought o organize.
"Your interests are no properly
protected in t'ne legislatur< of your
B state.'* he said, "and never .ill be so
long as the legislature is (ominated
^B and controlled by corporatio. lawyers.

[ All these reforms, he said, he had

fected some of them, and reform was
I needed and should be had, but it was
| the duty of those vested with the
proper authority to make them, and
j the board of charities, running around
ever the state making recommendations,
was a waste of the people's
money.

ed to fool the people on the state levy,
| fixing it at ~->Vz mills, but that in reality
is was " mills, there being an extra
levy of 1 mill for pension and % mill
for the state hospital for the insane.
He said that Senator McLaurin deserved
the credit for the warehouse
system, and rhat it was "the extra ses|
sion of the legislature called by
j Blease" that gave it to the people,
i thrmj^h the efforts of Senator McLau
| rin. He told of a gentleman who came
to his office wanting to borrow $6,500.
That man, he said, was a large farmer,
his lands being worth from $100 to
$200 an acre, but ne could not'borrow
a cent of money either on his land or
his cotton. "I sent him to McLaurin
fo: state warehouse receipts on his
cotton, and within thirty minutes he
had borrowed his $6,500, and he got it
at 6 per cent interest."
Hp said nobody wanted to injure the
higher institutions of learning, but
they were ^Jng extravagantly supported,
and he referred to the borrowing
of $S5,000 by Clemson last year,
and $100,000 being asked for this year
-mnoey, he said, which would never
be paid back: Clemson, he said, would
be of just as much benefit to the people
of the state if she were run economically.
The idea of these demonstrators,
he said, "going around teaching
the farmers how to plant pinders.
These farm demonstrators are going
around pretending to deliver farm lec
tures, but in reality they are preaching
politics, and using their offices for political
purposes."
He said the year 1915 had written
the bloodiest record South Carolina
had ever known?16 white women having
been criminally assaulted, and
more murders having been committed
than during any previous year. He
said that with all this crime, not one
single bit of it had been laid to the
door of any of the convicts he had paroled
or pardoned with the exception
of one "poor crazy fellow who they
say killed a woman and then committed
suicide?but if you will take the
testimony and read it 1 believe you
will come to the conclusion that .the
woman in her shamp and depredation
killed him and then herself." He referred
to a letter which he said was
the direct cause of the Winnsboro
tragedy. "I have a letter in my possession,"
he said, "written by Sheriff
Hood--l have never mentioned it before
because I did not care to bring
politics into that trial. I have a letter
written by Sheriff Hood to Clyde Isenhower,
and in that letter he said these
words: 'I have got to protect the prisoner
aY all hazards or lose my commission,
Governor Manning has already
told me that.' -The life of Hood
and the life of Boulware and the life
of Isenhower are charged directly and
positively to the office where these instructions
went out, 'that you must
protect that infernal brute at all harzards.'
and Hood, acting under the fear
of losing his office, shot Clyde Isenhower,
for which he died."
He said he was not a candidate for
governor for his own ambition, and
if the people he represented would
agree on any one man he would withdraw
in his favor. But that was the
only thing that would take him out of
the race?he proposed to fight the people's,
battle. There would never be
political peace in South Carolina, he
said, so long as one faction turned out
all the other faction as soon as it got
in office?the faction now in power
even exceeded its authority in turning

court (referring to the case of,
Sheriff Huckabee of Kershaw, who was
on the stand). "You can't expect aj

i together and elect men to the legisla'
ture who would truly represent their
interests, and not serve only the cor.
porations.

Senator Jno. L. McLanrin.
Senator iM.cLaurin was introduced
by Chairman Kelly, as the "man who
has done more for the farmers of this j
state in a short period of time than
; any other man since the war."
j Senator McLaurin briefly sketched j
the inauguration of the system, and ;
told of the bitter fight which had been
wa.?pd asainst it by the financial inter- i
| ests and the insurance trust. He told ;
: of how the system nad reduced the in- \
!
surance rate on country cotton from i
| $3.50 per hundred dollars, on a shortterm
cancellation basis, to $1.58 per {
hundred, on a pro 'rata cancellation i
basis, a saving of considerably more
I than 60 per cent, and of how the char|
acter of the state receipt had been es;
tablished in the money centers, and
! maney secured upon the state receipt
at 5 and 6 per cent interest at a time
( when it was well-nigh impossible to |
: borrow money in South Carolina at j
o-mi- rQto nf intprpst on anv kind of !
security. \
The real fight against the state ware
house system, he said, had a deeper
j foundation, however, than the fact that"
, money could be borrowed on the state
! receipt at 6 per cent, and that insur- j
! ance rates had been enormously re|
duced. '"Through all the ages," he
>said, "your forefathers and my forefathers
have been waging a fight for
pt rsonal liberty. People are now coming
to understand that the man who
controls your source of income, the I
man who controls your labor?who
controls your means of subsistence?
controls 'you, and that this control is
I being exercised through the subtle inj
fluence of the money power; that there
| is no liberation for the people until
j you can free them from financial slavi
ery, and the moment you break the
chains of that bondage, then and then
only will we have a free citizenship.
Here is the reason they oppose the
state" warehouse system: I said at
Spartanburg last summer that the
money of this country belongs to the
Deonle of this country; that nobody
has any more right to a monopoly of j
money than to exercise a monopoly of
j anything else; that money is nothing
in the world but a medium of exchange,
and that in a certain sense it
j is a common Carrier, like a railroad or
telegraph company, and that intere#
rates are nothing but carrying charges,
like freight to a railroad, or tolls to a
telegraph or telephone company. That
is the movement of which the state
warehouse system is the exponent in
the South, and if they can destroy it,
then they break the back of the move- J
ment and rivet the chains on (you. That
is the reason I haven't been willing to
retire from the position which the
people of this state, through their legislature,
'put me in, for I have been
able to call every trick which the
money power has attempted to make,
and with the help of God I will never
stop until we have made the pound of
cotton the unit of -credit, and thie same
in the hands of the poor man as in the
hands of the rich."
In the face of the disastrous condition
created by the war, he said, we had
been able to maintain the price of thi3
year's crop at from 11 to 13 cents a
pound, and for the first time in the
history of t'he crop the tenant and the
poor man have received the benefit of
the high price. "The balance of the
crop is in the hands of strong men,
able to carry it, and we will make them
pay back some of that four hundred
million dollars that they stole from us

ANOTHER USER SUNK
WITH LOSS OF LIVES
[ BRITISH STEAMER PERSIA TORPEDOED
IN MEDITERRANEAN.
Robert 3IcXeely of North Carolina,
American Consul to Arabia,
Among the Missing.
London, Jan. 1.?The British liner
Persia, carrying more than 200 pas
sengers and a crew of between 250
and 300 men, was sunk by an unidentified
submarine at 1 o'clock Thursday
afternoon off the island of Crete,
in the eastern Mediterranean. Reports
to the Peninsular and Oriental
Steam Navigation company sui'd that
nearly all on board were lost. Robert
McXeely of Monroe, X. C., American
consul at Aden, Arabia, and Robert
Grant of Boston were on the liner.
Four boats are known to have got
away from the sinking vessel, eacn
capable of carrying 60 persons, but it
is not know iS the boats were full
The rescued were picked up by a
steamer bound for Alexandria, where
thev are exnected to arrive todav.
Peninsular and Oriental line officials
said they received no details concerning
the disaster and did not know
whether the Persia received warning.
They also were unable to give any information
concerning Americans on
the ship.
Cable communication with th?
East is so slow that details of the
disaster are not expected for a day or
two, but the meagre reports received
give rise to the fear that the sinking
of the Persia will prove the most disastrous
result of submarine campaign
since the torpedoing of the Lusatania.
But Little Information.
Every efforts is being made by Conj
on hand now until they paiy our price,
| and they are beginning to realize that
i fact."
Senator McLaurin said that in his
| forthcoming report to the general as#
sembly, which he wanted the farmers
to read, he was going to expose the
machinations of the trusts whic'n had
been fighting the state warehouse system,
and was going to offer to submit
to the legislature the proof that these
trusts were operating in violation of
both state and national laws, and he
hoped the legislature would take up
the matter for investigation ana pusn
it. His reference to several matters
with which he will deal in his annual
report created a great deal of surmise,
and the report will be looked for witn
much interest.
The state warehouse system, he said,
had experienced a rapid growth and
development; what it needed now was
the active backing of the farmers and
the business people of the state in its
continued fight in their interests. "It
is time," he said, "for the farmers of
South Carolina to rise up and assert
themselves." He said he believed in
the organization of t'ne farmers, and
they had a right to have secret or open
meetings, just as they pleased. "Is
the farmer to be the only man in all
our society who can't have a secret organization?
Do you suppose those insurance
people, when they meet, let
me know what t'ney are doing? Do
you suppose the warehouse mergers,
when they meet, go out and blazon it
to the world, and inform us of what
their plans and purposes are? This
is a free country, and the farmers have
a right to organize, and to serve their
Koc+c intprpsfc hv organization
if they so desire."
During t'ne' course of his address
Senator McLaurin developed his idea
of a system of rural credits. If a man
can borrow money on the product of
his land, cotton, at 6 per cent, why
can't he borrow money on his land,
the basis of all wealth, at 6 per cent?
If the product of the soil has been
turned into a fluid as6et, why can't
the land itself be turned into a fluid
asset?making land what God intended
it should be, the controlling power
Ill LUIO TTUUU .
The state warehouse system, he explained,
was a great step in the direction
of an adequate and efficient system
of rural credits, which must be
brought about if we are to escape an
industrial upheaval.
Both Senator McLaurin and Former
Governor Blease were given close attention,
and the audience frequently
evidenced its sympathy and approval
by hearty applause.
Every effort is being made by Condon
to get some information about
Robert X. McXeely and Robert Grant

Skinner chat it had no information
with regard to the fate of individual

The Persia sailed from London on
December 18 for Bombay, with 61 firstclass
passengers and 83 second cabin
passengers, including eight children.
Some of these, including Edward Rose,
a Denver school boy, were landed at
Gibraltar, Marseilles and Malta. At

women and 25 children, were taken j
aboard, bui line officials say that after
deducting those leaving the ship at
various ports of call, something more
than 200 passengers were on the (vessel.
' A majority of the Persia's passengers
were British, bound for India, including
many women. Her cargo was
small, but slie carried a heavy consignment
of mail. The crew was made
up principally of Lascars.
Sixty-one first-class passengers and
83 cabin passengers, including eight
children, boarded the steamship Persia
at London, according to information
obtained from the Peninsular and
urientai line.
At Marseilles 35 of the first-class
and 32 of the second cabin boarded the
boat. The company estimates that after
deducting the number of passengers
leaving the ship at her various
ports of call about 160 passengers
were aboard when the vessel was sunk.
Every effort is being made by Consul
Gen. Skinner to get some information
about Robert McXeely, the
American consul at Aden, and the two
other Americans known to be on the
passenger list. The British admiral
ty iniormea Jir. sKinner u naa no information
with regard to the fate of
<;he individual passengers. .Mr. Skinner
sent a cablegram to the American
consulate at Alexandria revesting the
consul to ascertain the fate of Consul
McXeely and the other Americans.
(The Peninsular and Orien^l company
stated that the Persia haa lufc
London December IS and Marseille:December
26, carrying British mails
bound for Bombay, and that she Was J
sunk off the island of Crete. Only four
boats got away from the ship. Tnese
boats were picked up by a steamer
bound for Alexandria and the survivors
were expected there this morning.
The names of the passengers saved
have not yet been received. The com
pany's statement says it is reared mat j
the loss of life among the passengers
and crew will be heavy. Officials of
the line say t'ney are unable to give
any information concerning American
citizens on the Persia. They say the
steamship carried a large number of
persons, but that no official figures are
available as yet. Passenger lists have
not been published since the beginning
of the' war.
Mr. McNeely sailed from New York
for England on November 27 on the
Holland-American liner Ryndam. A
fellow passenger was Koberr f. 5Kinner,
American consul general at London.
Mr. Skinner advised him to sail
for the East by the Dutch line, but the
young man already had engaged passage
on the Persia.
The Persia was last reported at Malta
on December 20.
The Persia was a steamer of 7,974
tons gross. She was owned by the
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation
company of London. She sailed
from Bombay November 14 for London
and was last reported as leaving Gibraltar
on December 2.
The Persia was one of several vessels
recently sunk by submarines in
the eastern Mediterranean, through
would take her from Malta. On De-1
cember 24 the French liner Ville de la j
Ciotat was sent to the "bottom off the I
island of Crete by a submarine which,
according to unofficial British advices,
flew the Austrian flag.
The Persia was 'built in 1900 at
Greenock. She has been in the Bombay
service since that time.
On account of the danger from submarines
to vessels which pass through
the Suez canal and the Mediterranean
