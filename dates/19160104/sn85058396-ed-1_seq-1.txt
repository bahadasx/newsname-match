Bill Arouses Serious
Contention.
London, Jan. 4, 2 a. in. It again
becomes apparent that the cabinet
crisis is far from ended. The only
definite point is that Sir John Simon,
secretary of state for home affairs,
has resigned He had a prolonged
interview with Premier Asquith yes
terdav. The premier did his utmost
to induce Sir John to remain in the
cabinet, but without avail and it is
almost certain tfiat the home secre
tary's resignation will be officially
announced on the re-assembling of
parliament
The position of Reginald McKenna,
chancellor of the exchequer, and Walt
er Runciman. president of the board
of trade, is still undecided. They are
making the chief government compul
sion bill conditional upon securing a
concession to their views on the event
ual size of the army.
Premier In Embarassing Position.
,JnJ.his matter Eremier Asquith .ia
In an "embarassing position. He is
being strongly impelled from the out
ide not to yield this point and it Is
believed that a majority in the cabinet
itself is against their views. Hence
today's meeting of the cabinet to con
sider the latest draft of the compul
sion bill may result in further changes'
and may possibly result In the resig
nation of these two important min
isters.
The treatment of Ireland is another
thorny problem and the conflicting
statements regarding this matter may
be an indication of the struggle which
will go on in the cabinet. All the pap
ers, both conscriptlonists and support
ers of voluntary enlistment agree that
Ireland will be excluded from the oper
ation of the bill and that the Press
Association statement that Ireland
would be included was inaccurate Ac
cording to the Times, Ireland was iu
eluded in the first draft of the bill
which was only intended to provide
a convenient basis for discussion.
The Morning Post expresses the be
lief that Premier Asouith has been
able to give Mr. McKenna and Mr
Runciman assurances that measures
can and Avill be taken to ensure that
a sufficient number of men will be left
not only to carry on the manufacture
of munitions but all trades vital to
the interest of the country. The Post,
although a conscriptionist paper, at
taches importance to the retaining of
these two ministers in the cabinet.
Would Safeguard Navy.
The Daily Chronicle says that the
new bill contains a clause safeguard
ing the navy from the danger of the
bill sweeping all efficient men into
the ramy and estimated that when all
allowances are made for unfit men
and those required for the manufac
ture of munitions and for other neces
sary services, the bill will bring only
200.000 men into the army.
Wednesday's sitting of parliament
will be of exceeding interest Be
sides Premier Asqulth's statement, Sir
John Simon will make a brief address,
explaining his position. He had al
ready taken formal farewell of his de
partment chiefs The names of Lewis

and Herbert Samuel, chancellor of

WAR MOVES DELAYED
Bulgarians and Turks Being
Put Ahead of Teutons in
Order to Save Their
Own Men.
London, Jan. 4. 2:33 a, m. The
Balkan correspondent of tho Times
sends a dispatch in which he de
clares that the Bulgarian officials are
in complete subjection to German
jurisdiction. He says that every de
partment of the Bulgarian administra
tion is under control of German of
ficers whose permission ifc necessary
for the transaction of the simplest
business.
He continues:
"In order to strengthen the German
hold on Bulgaria and Turkey and to
spare their own men, the Germans
aim at employing native troops, so
far as possible, in foreign service and
in pursuance of this policy will em
ploy Turkish as well as Bulgarian
troops for an advance on Saloniki.
The delay in this attack is not clue
to the difficulty in bringing up troops
and supplies but to the reluctance
of Greece to open her frontier in
fear that the Bulgarian soldiers will
take revenge for the events of June,
1913. The prospect of re-entering
Saloniki, however, is the only remain
ing inducement Germany can offer
Bulgaria for continued participation
In the war and if this is refusecj the
incipient peace movement in Bulgaria
will make rapid progress with the re
sult that the next few months may
witness a strong reaction in Bulgar
ian public sentiment."

Notified of United States' Action.
Washington, Jan. 4. Official an
nouncement that the government will
act In the newest phase of the sub
marine crisis brought on by the sink
ing of the Persia, was made today at
the White House.
Secretary Tumulty issued this state
ment for the president:
"The president and the secretary
of state are taking every means pos
sible to obtain the cold facts in this
grave matter and will act just as
soon as the information is obtained."
President Confers With Senators.
In the absence of detailed and spe
cific information on which to base the
next step. President Wilson cancel
led the cabinet meeting which was to
have been held today, but conferred
with Chairman Stone and some mem
bers of the senate foreign relations'
committee.
Chairman Stone told the president
there were intimations that some sen
ators were preparing to make speech
es on the sinking of ships with loss of
American life. The president is un
derstood to have simply replied that
the administration was doing all it
could to protect American rights.
President Reads Dispatches.
The president instructed Secretary
Lansing to bring immediately to the
White House any information which
came to hand and then began him
self reading the official dispatches so
far received and getting into touch
generally With the situation.
The administration is depending
largely upon the inquiries which Am
bassador Penfield has been Instructed
to make at Vienna and the informa
tion which consuls are gathering else
where, to establish the nationality of
the submarine which is said to have
sunk the Persia, and to develop the
facts in the case generally.
Senator Stone told the president
that when the foreign relations' com
mittee met tomorrow he wanted to
be prepared to meet- any situation
that might arise.
Senate Awaiting Facts.
The senator said after his talk with
the president that until the facts re
garding the Persia were obtained
nothing could be done.
Any nation, he declared, which out
raged the United States, should be
dealt with severely.
Later Chairman Flood of the house
foreign affairs' committee called at
the White House and conferred with
President Wilson the situation.
President May Send Official
Message.
White House officials said today
both the house and senate would be
kept informed of all important de
velopments in the foreign situation,
probably through conferences between
the president and senate and house
loaders although If any drastic action
is taken it is possible that the presi
dent might send a message to con
gress. There was no indication today of
what tho prospects were for the Uni
ted States formally acquainting Bul
garia and Turkey of Its position on
tho question of subraarino warfare.
Bulgars and Turks to Be Notified.
II has been proposed that such ac
tion should be taken so that such ac
tho central power belligerents could
plead lack of official information, as
Austria did in the Ancona case. The
course of the United States In that
regard will be developed definitely
later.
It was disclosed, however todav
that some time ago the United States'
complete submarine correspondence
with Germany was sent to the Ameri
can diplomatic representatives in
Turkey and Bulgaria and also was de
liveied to tho. diplomatic representa
tives of those two countries in Wash
ington. President Wilson returned to Wash
ington today and consulted with mem
bers of the senate foreign relations'
committee concerning the submarine
crisis created by the sinking of the
British steamer Persia In the Medi
terranean, i
Particulars regarding the sink
ing of the Peninsular and Oriental
steamer Gelong are still lacking ex
cept that it is known that there was
no loss of life when she went down.

Boston, one of the two Americans M
known to have been onboard the M
British steamer Persia when she was fl
torpedoed in tho Mediterranean last
Thursday, has arrived in Alexandria. H
Mr. Grant, so far as is known, is the , UH
only American from whom can come M
the story of the Persia's sinking. H
He gave to the Associated Press to- H
day the most detailed account yet re- H
ceived of the disaster. H
"I was in the dining saloon of the H
Persia at 1:05 p. m.," he said. "I had H
just finished my soup and the stew- IH
ard yvap asking what I would take for H
my second course when a terrific ex- IH
plosion occurred. IH
"The saloon became filled with IH
smoke, broken glass and steam from M
the boiler, which appeared to have H
burst. There was no panic on board. H
We went on deck as though we were H
at drill and reported at the lifeboats H
on the starboard side, as the vessel H
had listed to port I clung to the rail- IH
ing. The last thing done was to tie IH
on Captain Sprickly's lifebelt
"As the vessel waa then listing so M
badly that it was impossible to launch M
the starboard boats I slid down the M
starboard fail into the water. I got
caught in a rope which pulled off a IH
shoe, but I broke loose and climbed H
on some floating wreckage, to which IH
I clung. H
"The last I saw of the Persia she
had her bow in the air five minutes J
after the explosion M
"After floating about on the wreck- H
age until 4 o'clock in the morning, I J
saw boats. I was pulled into one of H
them. We rowed about looking for IH
"The boats became overloaded and
the occupants were re-distributed. IH
Four boats were tide together and IH
the fifth followed some distance
away. H
"My boat left the others In order H
to search the more frequented steam- H
ship channels for help. Wo rowed for H
three hours. Then we saw a cruiser H
and called out, 'We are English.' We H
explained that we were survivors of IH
the Persia and gave directions to the H
cruiser aB to where the other boats !
were. They were soon found and tho H
occupants were taken off immediate- H
ly by tho English sailors. H
"Robert McNeely, American consul H
at Aden, sat at the same table with H
me on the voyage. He was not seen H
probably because his cabin was on the
port side. H
"It was a horrible scene. The wa- H
ter was black as ink. Some pasen-
gers were screaming, others were H
calling out goodbye. Those in one H
boat sang hymns." H
