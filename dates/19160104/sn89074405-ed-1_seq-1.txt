Washington, Jan. 4.—The expected
attack on the administration foreign
policy and Its course in the subma
rine crisis, failed to materialize In the
senator when that body, after being in
session leas than ten minutes, ad
journed until noon tomorrow. The
reason assigned for the sudden ad
journment by the leaders of both sides
was that several senators who had
expected to have business to present,
did not have It ready.
The motion on which the senate ad
journed, however, was in observance
of the death of Associate Justice La
mar of the supreme court.
Forecasted Trouble.
Earlier in the day, Chairman Stone
•t the foreign relations committee. In
conference with President Wilson over
1
lie submarine crisis, told the presi
dent he had heard intimations that
some senators were going to assail
the administration's course, and that
Home others were going to attack the
Mexican policy. The International sit

Senator Fall, republican, of New
Mexico, had ready a resolution call
ing on President Wilson to inform
the senate to what government the
president proposed to accredit Henry
Frather Fletcher, who had been nom
inated for ambassador to Mexico. He
will introduce the resolution tomor
row, and it is expected that It will be
made a vehicle for general represen
tations and attack, not upon Fletcher,
but upon the administration's Mexi
can policy.
Other senators to share Senator
Fall's views declare the senate has
no knowledge of a government in
Mexico, and that the president's last
communication to congress on the
subject described a state of anarchy.
In the house several matters of im
portance came to the front after the
session convened at noon. Secretary
McAdoo asked a rush appropriation
of $100,000 for rural sanitation for
fighting typhoid and pellegra.
The naval affairs committee ar

Measures Taken to Prevent
Shortage Affecting Ship
ping of Supplies.
NOT ENOUGH
NEUTRAL SHIPS
English and Neutrals Re
gard Move with Misgivings
—Injure Foreign Trade.
London, Jan. 4.—The government
is taking stringent measures to see
that the prevailing shortage in ships
shall not Interfere with the shipment
of food and other necessities to ports
in the United Kingdom. Vessels are
being requisitioned right and left for
the shipment of wheat from tha
Americas, and In shipping circles it Is
reported that the admiralty intends to
call in the British ships that are now
trading between foreign ports. The
latter measure is expected to particu
larly affect British ships trading be
tween South America and the United
States. Shippers here predict that
such action would have a disastrous
effect on their trade.
Ship owners in England and neu
tral shippers regard the new-born en
ergy of the government with misgiv
ings, as requistioned wheat ships are
receiving only thirteen shillings, com
pared with the normal rate of seven
teen shillings.
The first hint a vessel receives that
it Is to be requistioned is the follow
ing telegram from the admiralty to
ward the free end of its voyage.
"You are required by the requisi
tioning (carriage of foodstuffs) com
mittee to fix your vessel to load' a car
go of 7 E per cent, wheat from the At
lantic coast of Canada, the United
States or the Gulf, to the United King
dom. Tou may make your own ar
rangements as to freight, etc. Formal
notice is following by letter."
The owners then receive the follow
ing letter from the transport depart
ment of the admiralty:
"I have to inform you on behalf of
the requisitioning (carriage of food
stuffs) committee that it has been
found necessary to require your ves
sel to be employed in the North At
lantic wheat trade, have, therefore,
to give you formal notice In accord
ance i^ith the provisions of an' order?
In-eouncfl dated Nov. 10, 191P.. thtf
the -above vessel is rafUisftinned un-
Qrder. Under this, the. re­
quisition committee requires you, un
der the authority given them in the
order quoted, to arrange forthwith
that the vessel shall be fixed to load
at a port on the Atlantic coast of Can
ada or the United States, Including
the Gulf, a cargo os which at. least
75 per cent, shall consist of wheat,
and to discharge this wheat at some
port or ports of the United Kingdom.
The vessel Is to proceed on its arriv
al In the United States to one of the
above ports to load, as stated.
.. Upon Oo-operation.
I have also to lequlre you to in
form me within a week of this date
of the arrangements you have made.
The committee rely confidently upon
the good will of the ship owners gen
erally and their co-operation in ar
ranging for the supply of such addi
tional tonnage as the national re
quirements may necessitate from
time to time in the trade now in ques
tion, or in any other for which simi
lar action may be required."
The last sentence Is considered as
significant corroboration of news al
ready received by charterers that the
government intends to make full use
of its undoubted power to completely
control the British mercantile marine.
The assertion of such power means
the Inevitable Injury of foreign trad
ers, who depend largely on British
ships for the carrying of goods.
For example, it is reported on the
Baltic shipping exchange that the
American coffee trade, which Is large
ly dependent on British ships, will
be vitally Injured by any considerable
withdrawal of these vessels, for suf
ficient neutral ships to take their
places do not exist.*
Other trades with South and Cen
tral American ports also will suffer
great damage if the requisitioning
plan is extended to British ships
trading between foreign ports.
MEXICAN IMPORT

El Paso, Tex., Jan. 4.—Mexican im

and mining corporations are expected

Senators May Speak.
Chairman Stone told President Wil
son there are intimations that some
senators are preparing to make
speeches on the sinking of ships with
the loss of American life. President
Wilson is understood to have simply
replied that the administration is do
ing all it could to protect American
rights.
President Wilson instructed Secre
tary Lansing to bring immediately to
the White House any new informa
tion which came to hand, and then
busied himself reading official dis
patches so far received, getting In
touch generally with the situation.
Depend on Consuls.
The administration is depending
largely on inquiries which Ambassa
dor Penfield has been instructed to
make at Vienna, and that which the
consuls are gathering elsewhere, to
establish the nationality of the sub
marine said to have sunk the Persia,
and to develop facts in the case gen
erally.
Deal Severely.
Senator Stone told the president
that when the foreign relations com
mittee met tomorrow, he wanted to
be prepared to meet any situation that
might arise. The senator said, after
his talk with the president, that until
the facts regarding the Persia are ob
tained. nothing could be done. Any na
tion, he declared, which outraged the
United States, should be dealt with
severely.
Message to Congress.
Later, Chairman Flood of the house
foreign affairs committee called at the
White House and conferred with
President Wilson on the situation.
The White House officials said both
the senate and house would be kept
informed on all the important devel
opments In the foreign situation, and
probably that the conferences between
the president and the senate and
house leaders be held, although if
any drastic action is taken it is pos
sible that the president may send a
