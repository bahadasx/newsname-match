NEW YORK. Jan.' 4. At tbe close
of 1915 the war has cost more than
twenty-six billion dollars, exceeding by
five hundred million the total national
debt of the six principal belligerent
powers when the conflict began. With
the exception of about five million
raised in the United Kingdom by tax
ation, practically all the expenses of
the war havo been met by borrowed
money. The end of 1915, therefore,
finds the fighting nations saddled
with double the debt they had ac
cumulated in 'all centuries preceding
the outbreak of the war.
In the early daya of the war the
most liberal estimate of ita cost, in
cluding the destruction of property and
the economic lossea caused by casual
ties, waa fifty million dollars per day.
The actual expense now, exclusive of
economic and property losses, Is
eighty-five million per day.
Of thia amount tho Quadruple en
