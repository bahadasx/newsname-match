TOGETHER IN
Aged "Mr. an3 Mrs. Fred F. Moser
Pass Away at Gilbert's Creek
Sunday a Few Hours Apart.
As they had gone down the' path
way of life together, hand in hand,
so Mr. and Mrs. Fred F. Moser, o
Gilbert's Creek, crossed the Valley
of the Shadow of Death together
Sunday. Mr. Moser died at five
o'clock on the Sabbath, morning and
Ms life-long partner and help-mate
followed him to the other shore at
nine o'clock that evening. Had their
wishes "been consulted, it is proba
ble that death came- to this aged
pair just. as they would have had
It come. After a life time of love.
and devotion, they went -to their re
ward together.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Moser had been
in very feeble health for some time
and their deaths were not unexpected
to their large family and their loved
ones. Mr. Moser was born in Febru
ary, 1834, and his wife January 1,
1840, making him 82 years old and
her 76. Both were born in this coun
ty and resided here all of their lives.
Mr. Moser was a prominent farmer
most of his life and respected and
esteemed by all who knew him.. Mrs.
Moser was before their marriage,
Miss Lavinia Keynolds, daughter of
the late Jackson Reynolds.
To their union nine children were
born, five boys and four girls, and
all were with their parents, surround
ing their bedsides -when the ends
came. The children are Messrs. Wil
liam Moser, near -McCormack's
church, John Moser, -of Moreland,
Logan Moser. of Hamilton, Ohio Dan
and Josh Moser, of Gilbert's Creek;
Mrs. Susie Singleton, of Texas, Mrs.
Julia Reynolds, of this county, Mrs.
Rosa Lunsford and Miss Jane Moser,
also of the county. ,
Both had been faithful Christians
for many years, and the examples
they set to their children and loved
ones will long be shining lights down
the path of the years.

POLITICIANS
The "boys" evidently ran short on
Christmas booze in town last week,
for a surreptitious visit was made fco
the Traylpr distillery on the Goshen
pike, north of town, and about 20
gallons stolen. Entrance was ef
fected by prizing open a window and
the booze was taken rrom a barrel.
The loss was discovered next day
by Dr. W. D. Tardif, colored store
keeper, who notified Deputy Collect
or Rowan .Saufley, -and an investiga
tion was made at once. The latter
believes he has a pretty good clew
to the booze burglar.
There are about 390 barrels of Old
Edgewood whisky left at the locked
government warehouse, which is
about alL there is left of the once-famous
old distillery. The whisky is
owned by 'the Paxton Bros., of Cin
cinnati. As soon as all of the whisky
reaches the age of eight years, it has
to be drawn out. The oldest there
now is six years old. Quite a lot has
been bottled and shipped out. The
government keeps a man on duty in
the day time at any warehouse which
contains as much as 5,000 gallons,
but if a few more burglaries at this
warehouse are successfully engineer
ed, Uncle Sam will soon be relieved
of, this extra expense. This is the
third or fourth time the warehouse
has. been robbed of booze, and as
there is no guard maintained at
night, some surprise has been pre
viously expressed that some of the
nifty booze artists of this section
have not backed an auto truck up
one fine night and qarted off all it
would hold.

the plight of Mr. Deatherage, and
nelped him get safely to land. It
was a brave deed on the part of the
colored boy and he is Deing warmly
commended for the heroism he dis
played. The creek was very high
and the current swift. It had cut
so far under the abutments of the
bridge that the structure threatened
to give way, so Road Engineer Riffe
who is endeavoring to always be on
the job in case of. such emergencies,
dispatched a small force to the
bridge, to make what repairs seemed
necessary. The big rocks of the
abutment, some as much as four
feet in diameter, ,were very loose,
and when the bridge workers tried
to handle them, came down on top of
them, from their weakened ground
support, and carried the men into the
creek with them. In addition to a
severe wetting and almost getting
drowned. Mr. Deatherage 'had the in
step of his right foot broken by one
of the large rocks falling over upon
it and will be laid up for spme time.
Mr. Riffe has a good word to say for
the colored boy, Vardaman, who, he
declares, is one of the most; efficient
road and bridge helpers hehas ever
seen and a thoroughly reliable and
trustworthy man at all times.

Hustonville, Ky., Jan. 30
Christmas day was made a long to
be remembered one at the home of
Mar. and Mrs. J. F. Caughey, near
Hustonville, when their nine chil
dren, twenty-seven grand children,
one great-grand-child and several
friends gathered at their home to cel
ebrate their golden wedding anni
versary. The hospitable couple saw
to it that there was nothing lacking
to make the day an ideal one. The
greatest feature of the day was the
excellent dinner which included old
ham, turkey and everything else
that anyone could desire. To say the
long dining table looked beautiful is
but a mild way ojf expressing its
beauty. In the center of the table
was a Ifcyely cake surrounded bv fiftv

Sunday's papers had some interest
ing political gossip regarding efforts
which are being made to get out
opposition to Congrcssiman Harvey
Helm, of this city. A dispatch, f rorn
Danville to the Courier Journal saidT
The removal of Attorney General
James Garnctt to Louisville upon his
retirement eliminates him as a pros
pective candidate for Congress in the
Eighth district He had been con
sidering the solicitations of his
friends, but decided to retire from 4
politics and devote his energies to
law in the Falls City. Democrats
in the Eighth are making strong ap
peals to William Jennings Price to
become a candidate. He is the pres
ent United States Minister to Pana
ma, and an effort is on foot to in
duce him to resign the post and re
turn home to enter the fight for the
nomination next August.
Tom Cromwell, the Cincinnati En
quirer's Kentucky political writer,
had the following of interest here:
In the Eighth Congressional District-it
is rumored than an effort is
being made by certain influential
Democrats who are not favorable to
the re-election of Representative
Harvey Helm, Stanford, to clear the
decks so that Hon. George L. Pickett,
Shelbyville, who is to represent thejjfe
Fifty-fifth Legislative District at theef
coming session of the General As- '
sembly, may make the race for the--Democratic
nomination single-handed1
against the Lincoln county man,
who has the reputation of being the
best mixer in his party in his dis
trict. General James Garnett will
not be a candidate. He will prac
tice law in Louisville.
Several of the leading Republicans
of the Eighth District are of the
opinion that George D. Florence,
Stanford, may be the nominee of
their party for Representative. It is
said that Judge L. L. Walker, Lan
caster, who was the Republican nom-
inee for Lientenant Governor, and
who has been mentioned as a Con
gressional probability, has about per
fected an arrangement whereby he
is. to have the support of his party
leaders for Collector at Danville, to
succeed Judge John Hughes in the
event of the election of a Republi
can to the Presidency.- Ton

HUBBLE BRIDGE IN BAD SHAPE
County Road Engineer McKee
Riffe is doing everything he can this
week to make the bridge across
Hanging Fork between Hubble and
Danville safe. for traffic. This bridge
is owned jointly by Lincoln and
Boyle counties, and the Boyle offi
cials have been notified a number of
times concerning its . condition, but
have postponed co-operating with
the Lincoln officials in having ne
cessary repair work done, until the
bridge is getting in a dangerous
condition. Road Engineer Riffe made
an examination as soon as his atten
tion was called to its condition, and
he found that one of the wing walls
of the main abutments, was in very
bad shape, and some other form of
support for the bridge would have
to be provided at once. He took a
force,, of men to the bridge Monday
to jack it. up with timber supports,
until some joint action about it can
be obtained from the two counties
which own it together.

VOMEN OF SEDENTARY HABITS
Women who get but little exercise
are likely to be troubled with consti
pation and indigestion anc will find
Chamberlain's Tablets rightly benefi
cial. Not so good as a three or four
mile walk every day, but very much
better than to allow the bowels to
remain in a constipated condition.
They are easy and pleasant to take
and ."most agreeable in effect Ob
