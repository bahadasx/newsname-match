Political Gossip from
Washington.
Washington, June 21.1 (Special
Correspondence.) If the present
administration, had deliberately
made an effort to displease the
- public and make enemies for it
self, it could hardly haye sue
ceeded in that direction more ef
fectively than it has done. From
the Atlantic to the Pacific and
from the Canadian' line to the
Gulf, protests are still coming to
'members of -Congress asking in
most urgent terms to be protect
ed from the proposed changes in
delivery service. In
one community out in California
a public meeting of patrons of
the rural service was held and a
protest was drawn in such vigor-
ous language that it was feared
few people would sign it, but the
feeling was so pronounced that
99 per cent of the patrons of the
rural routes affected signed the
protest and then took up a collec
tion to pay the expense of tele
graphing the protest not mly to
the Department but to the sena
tors and the congressmen from
that district.
f XX X
Dissatisfaction with manage
ment of city postal service is also
apparent in many places. In one
western town where a large man
uf acturingjjusiness has grown up
in recent years and wnere nrsc
class postal service is important,
the Department announced a
change in postmasters. The bu
siness men of the town, who sup
ply practically all the mail busi
ness of the postoffice, signed and
sent to the Senate Postoffice com
mittee a protest against the ap
pointment of the proposed post
master, and asserted that if he
should be appointed, they would
under no circumstances allow j
their mail to be handled by bim, j
as they considered him wholly
unreliable. Those businessmen
were looking for service, not for
politics. Naturally, they were
not very favorably impressed
with the business efficiency of an
administration whose policies
made it necessary for- them . to
put their signatures to a protest
as emphatic as that. , '
XXX
Delay in government service
in this administration has com
pelled the public to adopt a wait
ing if not a watching policy. The
annual report, "Foreign Com-
- " t
merce and Navigation of the Uni
ted States for the year ending
June 30, 1915," made its appear
ance in June 1916, from the De
partment of Commerce, just nos
ing out the fiscal year 1916: Un
der the Republican regime this
report used to appear not later
than November, following the
close of the fiscal year. Statisti
-
cians and students of trade have
daily use for this volume and de
lay !n its appearance is vexatious,
The Monthly Summary of For
eign Commerce of the United
States is another report which is
now made public dfter considera
ble delay. ; If the Department of
Commerce would pay ., more at
tention to official duties, and less
to the campaign publicity work
being carried on at the taxpay-
ers' expense, the people would be
better satisfied and the Depart
ment would have a better record
at the tim? it changes hands next
March.

Our normal exports of barbed
wire amount to about $4,000,000
annually. During the nine months
ended March, 1916, we exported
$16,000,000 worth of this commo
dity. Nearly all of it went to
Europe. Was it because the na
tions at war are fencing off their
boundaries, or going into stock-
raising? , Not at all. It was to
string barbed wire entangle
ments. In every stage of the
manufacture of this barbed wire
abor received a benefit, and
stockholders in mine and factory
companies got increased divi
dends. Our exports of meat and
dairy products during this same
nine months totaled $145,000,000,
nearly all of which went to the
belligerents. Farmers, stock
holders and laborers profited by
the huge demand for meat and
dairy products. While this ex
port trade was going on the Dem
ocratic campaign committee was
busy composing publicity matter
to show that "Democracy brings
aneraof unexampkd prosperity."
The only way, they can., prove . it
is to show they were responsible
or the European war.

Gettysburg.
Summer is here and the days
will grow shorter from this on.
It seems as if war is inevitable
with Mexico. The President has
called 100,000 soldiers to serve a
long the Mexican border, to do
duty and guard against" incur
sions of Mexican bandits. Wha
shall we call it, if not war? Al
that is lacking is the proclama
tion giving it the name. ,
Well, the St. Louis convention
is among the things of the past
and did what was expected it
would do. The President shaped
its entire action, and a query
suggests itself, wnat willhappen
when this good man ceases to
exist? If his mantle and spirit
fails to fall on some other worthy
man a dire calamity will fall on
the country that may land it in
the vortex of ruin. But I sup
pose there is no need to be pes
simistic. Our nation so far has
outridden every threatened ca
lamity and will survive the threat
ening stcrm, if so we may speak.
It is well that, there is so much
submissive spirit among our Peo
ple. It is well that much of our
dislikes go no further than vents
of hot air, or air kicks, and there
end. I suppose it is well that we
are a practical people and usually
adopt the rifle that of all evils
choose the least .and endeavor to
get the greatest good out of eve
ry thing.
I suppose our equal suffragists
will feel elated at having secured
an equal suffrage declaration
from both the great parties. That
much accomplished, there yet re
mains the greater part to be done
before our mothers, wives, sisters
and daughters will hitch Dobbin
to the chaise and hold the lines
while we will all go together to
the polls to choose the rulers to
govern the country. Let us pos
sess ourselves in patience to see
the benefits of a sexless suffrage
and everybody equal before the
aw, and when civic righteous
ness shall everywhere prevail and
bless with peace and prosperity,
and good will to all, from the
humblest to the most exalted, and
from the unlettered to the most
erudite. v "
Columbus is something of an
attraction this week and what
may issue from the assemblage
of the worthies of our state who
may gather there to see that civic
righteousness shall prevail, and
see that the ship of state shall be
kept from danger from the break
ers. Of course, the right thing
will be'done and the state be kept
in the Republican column.
We are all looking for a safe
and sane Fourth, but have done
very little planning for it We
all know the day comes but once
a year and that it celebrates a
worthy cause and ought to be
celebrated as becomes a righteous
and worthy people and do , honor
as is meet for the action taken by
our worthy sires who built, we
believe, better than they knew
and gave us a government by the
people and for the people and be-
I queathed to us a most sacred her
itage, a duty to maintain it and
transmit it unimpaired to unborn
generations.
