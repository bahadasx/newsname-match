In the closing remarks of the Editor, he spoke and said tbe
Star Spangled Banper. Or what we call the Stars and Stripes is
not only an emblem of the Libarty, and Freedom of the American
people. But it is an emblem of heaven itself. The piece of
square blue is the representative of the blue arch of heaven.
The first Thirteen stars the representative of the thirteen
apostles, the seven red stripes the blood of Christ with tho seven
spirits of God. The six white stripes the pure wiiito body of
Christ, with the blood running down over the body. And then
said b.V tbo&e stripes are wo healed.
Ma? the Flag oyer wave from sea to sea, for it ,is an em LI em
of all right in the glorious sun-beam of time. Aroen.-
So the Colony spent the Flag's Day unltiug Children's Day
with it. AuJ a Patriotic ti rxio was spent.

WHY
DO NOT EVERYBODY
SEE ALIKE?
Samuel Merritt.
Continued from page 4.
And now dear reader we fully
trust that in tbe name of Jesus!
you may be able to comprehend
fr.-m this work the Divine Truths
that has been lying buried be
tween the lids of the Bible ever
ainco the image was set up, but
now is made manifest by tbe
Holy Apostles and prophets by
the S pirit that you may know
for yourself, when the Word of
Truth is righliy divided. And
that you may not only apprise
your Bible above all things, but
that you will dispose and com
municate all the light and know
ledge that you have gathered
from its sacred leaves either from
the perusal of this work or from
tho sacred book itself unto your
less favored fellow creature,
wfaplher they be far or near.
Who like Philip of old in the day
of ignorance,- knew not those
things; nor even that there was
such a book as the Bible; but
you devise means to inform the
ignorant of these fact, and of the
truths that which this grand old!,,
Book, contains. Also toknow thel
difference between tbe gentile)
and the Jew. ar.d tho difference'
between the Bible and those falso!
godless ruinous principles ofthe)
pernicious teachings of these
dark powers of tbe beasts. It
may be well for us to remark
here for the benefit of the reader
that there are some that claim
that they have the power to do
miracles by faith; while by a
closo investigation, you will find
it an evident fact, that they do
them by the power of animal ma-
guHism-Anothor one says I have
power to forgive sins; I do it in
the place of God. Oh, what god
lessness and hellisbness of our
time, ond blind and corruptness
of to day.
Perhaps the reader may think
from those remarks, that we
think or claim that God has not
the power to do the things above
spoken of; but we answer on the
other hand, that God - has not
only the power to open tbe eye9
of the blind, unstop the ears of
the deaf but he has the power to
raise the dead,
But what we have been laior
ing for,, is to prevent you from
being deceived by those false
sages of today whose words arc
as foft as honey but as bitter as
gail and as a deadly poison' to
the soul, And for this reason,
it is necessary for us to make
ready for the marriaga of Uu
Lamb; "for blessed are they
which are called unto tho marri
age of the Lamb ".fop' at that
time the tabernacle of God sha'l
be with men, and he shall dwell
with them and thev shall bo his
NO. 3,
people; and God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes; and
there shall be no mere death,
neither sorrow nor sighing, for
the former things have passed
away; and behold all things shall
become new; and He will give
unto them that thirst, the waters
of life freely. For this is the
promise of God to all that will
come and live godly in Christ
jJesu.. Amen.
We have been a Catholic.
Lo. Zion's standard is unfurled,
The dawning of a brighter day;
And majestic rises on tbe world,
The clouds ot error disappear.
Before tho rays of truth divine:
And the glory bursting from
afar.
Wide over the nations soon shall
shine,
The glorious light of bcthlahem's
star.
The Gentiles fullness will soon
come in,
When Israel's blessing is at hand
And. lo, Judah,s remnant cleans
ed from sin,
Shall in the promised Canaan
stand.
And angels from heaven anil
truth frotu earth,- - - -
Have met and both Dave record
born,
Thus Zion's light is bursting
forth,
To bring her ransomed children
home.
