WATCH AIID WAIT

with Inquiries' aa to the true situa
tion. A score of congressmen called
to learn the determination of the ad
ministration. The president Indicated
very clearly that If a change In policy
occurs, It will result on the Initiative
of the Mexicans.
If a conflict la found necessary as
a last resort, the president emphatic
ally declared It would, In no way, be
a war of conquest by the United
States. It would simply be a vigorous
effort to re-establish order and peace
In the trouble-ridden country and

lished on a sound foundation.
The president understands that the
main danger Is from Individuals In

Paris, June 22. Greece baa accept

allies' ultimatum.
The chief demand made by the
allies was for the Immediate demobll
Ixatlon of the Greek army, the allies
fearing the Greek forces might be
used against them. A number ot oth
er demands, the nature ot which was
not made public, were made on
Greece, resulting in the overthrow of
the Greek cabinet.
Mexico City, June 22. Mexican
officials today generally resented the
tone of the United States note and
pointed out what they declared to be
fallacies in President Wilson's argu
ment.. The text of the note had not been
made public at an early hour today.
General Carranza and his cabinet
studied the communication In a
lengthy special session . yesterday,
denying themselves to all visitors.
No formal statement was given out,
but the United Press today obtained
the views of a number of Mexican
officials who ' know the contents of
the note. Summed up. the Mexican
attitude la as follows:
"Regarding President Wilson's re
fusal to withdraw troops under the
terms ot the order Issued sending
them Into Mexico their presence on
Mexican soil Is no longer Justified or
logical. The order from the head of
the American army distinctly stated
that the expedition's sole object was
the arrest or death or Villa and the
dispersal of his band.
"That Villa Is dead Is generally be
lieved here, since three months have
elapsed since 'any one has seen htm,
and If alive, It Is not believed possible
by men who know htm that he would
be able to hold himself In check, His
mall force long ago was dispersed
and the only reason for keeping
troops In Mexico Is thus removed. The
Amerioan troops would be much bet
ter employed In patrolling the border
TDHE DF WiLSOtrS NOTE TO CARRAIIZA
RESENTED BY
News of Battle Causes Wash
ington OScials to Believe
That Ictervecb'cn Can Net
Be Uig Delayed
Washington, June 22. General In
vasion of Mexico appeared to hover
Just ahead today. '
The Carrizal clash between Mexi
can government and United States
troops, . apparently resulting in the
American expedition's heaviest losses
to date, gave ground for thla view of
ficially. ';.-,. :;'
General Pershing's report remained
as the confirming factor. It wae due
this , forenoon, barring unforeseen,
transmission difficulties. r
' There appeared little doubt that It
would aggravate rather than relieve
the situation, reported by Mexican
sources aa Involving the loss of 40
American lives, with other casualties.
Administration officials early today,
however, took the position that hasty
Judgment should be avoided. Until
General Pershing baa made formal re
port, they declared, it la not aafe to
assume that the battle at Carrizal was
necessarily an act of war ,? , y
, They declared that until Pershing
Is heard from In detail the president
will not go before congress.
Dispatches from Mexico City aald
today all blame was laid on the
American forces by the war office.
Against the Mexican claim that
the Americans were the ag
gressors, attempting to capture the
railway station at Carrizal, were
placed border reports that the Amer
icana were merely reconnoltertng and
were led Into ambush.
. General Punston will Immediately
strengthen Pershing's column, It is
expected. When President Wilson
takes the case before congress, he will

to keep out raiding bandits, rather
than concentrated In a small district,
aa at present, leaving large areas un
guarded. ,,
"We warmly challenge the state
ment that constitutionalist troops
have not co-operated with the Ameri
cana to prevent border raids.
"At the beginning of the trouble
and on the occasion ot the first ad
vance of American troops Into Mexico,
General Obregon, minister ot war,
asked Information concerning the
plans ot the American expedition, In
order that he might co-operate with
General Pershing's forces. This In
formation was refused, leaving him
unable to take such measures except
at a great disadvantage.
"We Indignantly deny that Car
ranzlsta soldiers have taken part In
raids, except on their own initiative.
Furthermore, no Boldiers now be
longing to the constitutionalist army
participated In any raids.
"The fact that one raider was found
with an old constitutionalist commu
nication In his pocket Is not good
proof of President Wilson's conten
tion. It Is not Just to blame the
Mexican authorities for such sporadic
acU, The statement that some of the
raiders wore Carranslsta uniforms
Is ridiculous, since there Is no distinc
tive garb for any Mexican forces.. The
troops generally wear the same kind
of khaki clothes worn by worklngmen
all over' the country.
