Following Weeks' of Sleuthing Officers
Capture Alleged Hide Thief When
He Calls for Mail at
Posloffice
ORGANIZED BAND IS
OPERATING IS BELIEF
Stolen Stuff is Shipped from Small Station
and is Discovered at Ardmore
in Transit to Fort Smith
Firm
Whnn Sheriff Hodge UuUeg turned
the key on A. U. Weeks and G. F.
Meeks yesterday, alleging tlutt one of
the prisoners was thought to be' I). C.
Mullenhouse, "the hide shipper," it is
thought that he completed the prelim
inary steps in what will, should the
state secure a conviction, possibly
break up one of the best organized
small bands of wholesale trouble mak
ers who have operated in this section
since the old cattle-rustling days.
May 30, or some time during the
night of that date, thieves' broke into
the slaughter house of W. H. Catteral,
near the Chickasha city limits, and
carried off $.'.110 worth of hides. A
wagon had been driven into a freshly
plowed field which abutted the slaugh
ter liens, there loaded and driven
away. Driving bauk t rhickuKhq the
wagon trail was lost on the asphalt
streets. It was late the next morning
when Sheriff Bailey was advised of
the theft. Immediately he began
systematic search for the thieves. He
caught their trail and followed it to
near Luwton where for a time it was
lost.
It was then that the sheriff, assisted
by C. H. Bailey, special inspector for
the Oklahoma-Texas Cattlemen's as
sociation, called off the direct search
for the parties and started in to locate
the place from which the loot might
have been shipped. All shipments of
hides from any point in the southern
part of the state, were watched. Es
pecially did the officers watch for
shipments from small stations on
branch roads, as past experiences has
taught' all officers that wholesale
"produce thieves' 'are prone to ship
from such places, considering the
small stations less liable to be watch
ed than are the larger railroad points.
Last week this theory Was proved
correct when the officers found that
a heavy shipment of hides had been
made from Lone Grove, billed to Fort
Smith. The shipment had been made
over a branch road, to be transferred
to a main line at Ardmore. In Ard
more the hides were soon located in a
box car In the railway yards.
Lone Grove is located nine miles
from Ardmore on the O. N. M. & P.
Uy. It is a very small station, located
in a farming and fruit growing belt.
The fact that very few cattle are
known to be raised in the Lone Grove
community led to the hides being
stopped at Ardmore and Sheriff Bailey
notified. Accompanied by Mr. Cat
teral. the sheriff went to Ardmore and
positively identified the hides as be
ing those stolen from Mr. Catteral.
The hides were consigned to the
Western Hide and Fur company, at
Ft. Smith. Catteral and Special Offi
cer Bailey went to that place and vis
ited the fur company's place of busi
ness. There it was ascertained that
since last fall the company had been
receiving shipments of hides from
points in southern Oklahoma and
western Texas from the same parties
and that during that time some thir
teen checks had been mailed to D. C
Mullenhouse in payment for those
shipments. Most of these checks had
j been sent to Mullenhouse at Sulphur,
OKla., although the shipments had
j been made from different places, as a
(rule each .shipment being made from
j some small st lion on an unimportant
.branch road. It was also ascertained
that the commission company had
