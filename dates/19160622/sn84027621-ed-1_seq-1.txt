It would take a courier or survivors
of the "American detachment many
hours to reach Pershing's base. Con
flicting stories of the fight have been
received here. . They seem to indicate,
however, that the Americans were
trapped or ambused and suffered their
chief losses by machine gun fire.
MEXICANS LEAVING JUAREZ
The Mexican garrison had 1 more
than half evacuated Juarez, opposite
here, at 10 o'clock this morning. It
is officially reported that three train
loads of soldiers have gone southland
three others are ready to move.
INQUIRY FROM MEXICO
Washington, June 27. An official
communication has been ' received
froin the Mexican foreign office an
nouncing the clash between Mexican
and American troops at Carrizal, say
ing the de facto government found it
difficult to understand why the Amer
ican troops were so far from their
base. The communication was deliv
ered to Secretary Lansing by Em
bassador Designate "Arredondo. Ar
redondo, after seeing Mr. Lansing,
, said he asked explanations of , why
American troops were approaching
Carrizal and the reported action of
General Pershing occupying Casas
Grandes and Neuve Casas Grandes.
Secretary Lansirtg had no official in
formation of the Carrizal affair and
didn't know, what Mexican towns
or whether any had been occupied by
American troops. Arredondo said he
was calling Secretary Lansing's at
tention to -what is called "lack of
prudence of the American commander
in approaching the Mexican railway."
CLASH AT CARRIZAL
El Paso, June 22.-r-According to
various accounts reaching here, the
American losses seem to have been
about twenty and the Mexican losses
forty. The battle took place about
10:30 o'clock yesterday morning and
lasted about an hour, and apparently
ended with both sides withdrawing.
J. C. Hubble was the American, who.
brought the report here, and his story'

is ' corroborated by James Maxey, an
American, who was also on the train!
Hubble and Maxey said they talked
with Carranza . officers at Villahua
mada, . and they said the Mexicans
claimed , to have killed seventeen
Americans and to have taken forty
prisoners, which contradicts earlier
reports. They said several hundred
Americans and one hundred and twen
ty Mexicans were engaged in the
fight. .. ' ; ';. r ; , y . . X':'y. v -;
Hubble declared that the Mexican
officers asserted that General Gomez
went forward to the Americans under
a flag of truce. Directly, the Ameri
cans began deploying in a semi-circle,
and Gomez, believing he was to be
attacked, gave the order for. his ma
chine guns to fire. He was later . kill
ed by -a pistol shot.
PERSHING HAS NO REPORT
San Antonio, June 22. General
Pershing wired General Funston this
afternoon that he hadn't received any
report on the Carrizal fight. He said
he had sent two squadrons of j- the
Eleventh cavalry to get into touch
With the troops of the Tenth engaged
at CarrizaL' Officers drew inference
from reports current that Captain
Charles T. Boyd, in command of
Troop M, Tenth cavalry was engaged
in the battle of Carrizal.
NO CHANGE IN POLICY
Washington, June 22. The admin
istration sees no reason in the Mex
ican accounts of the Carrizal clash
for a change of policy. No decision
will be made, however, until a report
is had from General Pershing.
President Wilson said in view of
the fact that the fignt is an incident
for which subordinate ' commanders
are responsible, it is not likely to pre
cipitate fighting. The ' Mexican for
eign office communication sought an
explanation of the presence of Amer
ican troops so far from their base,
and its tone and contents are taken to
indicate that Carranza seeks to dis
claim responsibility and make it plain
the de f acto-r government is not try
ing to expel Americans by force.
IN. THE ARMY AT ONCE
A resolution was submitted to
Chairman Hay, of the House military
affairs committee, authorizing the
president to draft members - of the
state militia willing to take the fed
eral oath immediately; into the regu-
ar army. Chairman Hay will ask
or immediate, action on the resolu-
& .
ion tomorrow.
The resolution given Chairman Hay
would provide for service during a
"period of emergency" instead of a
"period of war." It also would au
thorize the president to combine in
complete units, bring them to war
sjtrength and appoint officers.
A BIG EVENT
Adjustment Sale of Goldman's Starts
Saturday, June .24th
The big Adjustment Sale being ad
vertised in the Star promises to be
one of the most, important sales ever
held in this city.
Mr. B. Goldman informs us that he
has an immense stock on hand and
circumstances compel an immediate
adjustment of the entire stock. In
order to effect the desired ends, he
must sell several thousand dollars
worth of goods in a short time. This
accounts for the startling slashes in
prices to be made for this sale, and it
is to be expected that the sale will be
a success, and the store crowded from
its .opening to the end.
The Star is glad to call this sale to
the special attention of its readers,
knowing well that those who attend
will have every reason to be glad they
did so.

KNOTT WILL CONTEST
ELECTION OF.CATTS
Jacksonville, June 22.- At a con
ference of Mr. Knott's friends in
Jacksonville it was definitely decided
to contest the nomination for gover
nor.' Suit has already been instituted
in Leon county and suits will be in
stituted in precincts throughout the
whole state. Mr. Knott's friends feel
that enough discrepencies have oc
curred in the countiner of second
choice votes to more than offset Mr.
Catts' lead over him.
A vfriend of Dr. Montgomery in
Ocala received yesterdays a letter
from the doctor, who was in jail in
Gainesville, protesting against the re
port that he was imprisoned for try
ing to choke-his mother. The doctor
claimed that he was peacefully mind
ing his own business in his office Sun
day, when certain parties tried to kill
him, opening fire on the house from
behind trees some distance away.
This much of the story was corrob
orated by an Ocala chauffeur, who
was. m Micanopy Sunday, and was
warned by the people to keep away
from the vicinity of Montgomery's of
fice. The Star received its report
from the Gainesville Sun, but it is
willing to give Dr. Montgomery as
much correction as it can. Montgom
ery's friends are puzzled what to do
with him. He is conceded to be a
most kindhearted man and a superb
physician when he is sober. Ocala
has seen how much trouble he can
make when he is drunk. It is likely
that if he could be " put somewThere

would make one of the best of citi
zens.

OF
THEIR LAST
Early this morning the Ocala Rifles
left for 'Jacksonville, the first stage of
their probable journey to the border,
and perhaps far down into Mexico.
In their last day in the city, the
men received abundant testimony to
the fact that they were Very close to
the heart of the community, and that
all the people had suddenly awakened
to their worth. There swas nothing
too good for 'them; their money was
refused at the cigar and refreshment
stands, their uniforms , were their
tickets at the theater, and in all ways
possible the citizens strove to show
that they eppreciated their bravery
and patriotism. V -
They were a cheerful and well
behaved set of young men, doing their
work with efficiency, staying in or
around the armory most of the time,
and going down town only on duty or
leave. There were enough duties and
enough leaves, however, to cause them
to keep the streets lively, and almost
everywhere one looked ; there was a
bunch of their brown suits and rakish
hats.
There was not an intoxicated man
in the-entire hundred, from the time
they answered the first call until they
left, and that is a record seldom at
tained by any company, j
ixeany an siept in the armory
Tuesday night. The , hard cots were
a great contrast to" the comfortable
bed they had been used to, but most
of them made out very; well, and
looked fresh and chipper when they
lined up Wednesday for-"grub call."
Drills and getting thejr equipment
ready took up most of the day.
In - the meantime, preparations had
been made to give thenT "an ovation
when they came out for their evening
parade, and tho the time was short
and everything was informal there
was an expression of sentiment that
made the boys feel mighty good.
Shortly after eight o'clock, the east
and south sides of the square were
med with the waiting people. A ma
jority i of the autos in town were
standing by the curbs, both sides of
he . street south of the courthouse,
and the west side of Main being fair-
y packed with cars, beside many
down in the side streets. The side
walks 4rere crowded, and the Om1
louse veranda, lighted up for the oc
casion, was well filled. The band, led
by its veteran director, Albert Gerig,
was in the band stand, and all waited
anxiously for the soldiers to appear.
Meantime around at the armory the
company was lining up for the last
parade it should give in its home city
or some time. All the boys were in
ine, rookies as well as veterans, and
when tfoey moved forward in a col
umn of squads they made quite an im
posing array.
A Compliment to the Star
When the company reached the
Star office,, that grim and grimy brick
block, chum and side partner to the
armory for twenty years, and its
nexWoor neighbor "until the Temple
theater was built, the column halted,
the men faced to the right and gave
the Star three cheers. It was a tri
bute seldom given a newspaper by a
military organization, it was one of
the-finest compliments the Star ever
received, and all the force sincerely
appreciates it. X . -
Then the company resumed its
march and the alert pace of the men
soon carried them to the square. Used
to the leisurely pace of civilians, the
people were rather astonished "at the
rapid gait of the young soldiers;
hardly had the drumbeats been heard
and the head of the column come into
sight at the Fort King crossing of
plain when the company was on the
square. The band struck up and the
people cheered at the front ranks

street. In a column of squads, with
the officers at the head and the colors
in the center, they marched around
the square. ' The people did -not cheer
them much; perhaps they 'felt too"
deeply, but they watched the little
column with tensest intere?t, and the
one thought common to all was, "How
many of them will be here when they
march, around the square again."
lhe parade did not last long The
company after passing around the
square marched to in front of the
Ocala House, wheeled and returned to
the armory. '.Brief as the event was,
nothing has stirred Ocala so deeply
since the day over eighteen years ago
when the same company, composed of
boys, most of whom are miHHlp-jurpH
men nowleft the city for the Span
ish-American war.
.As the soldiers broke ranks at the
armory, their attention was. called to
some beautiful and appropriate music
in the Temple, where the singing of
patriotic songs was led by Mrs. Van
Hood, and Messrs. Lester Lucas and
Linn Sanders.
The W. C. T. U. Supper
During all this time adequate pre
parations were being made to refresh
the inner man. All the afternoon
and evening the members of the W.
C. T. U. had been nrenarinc a tooth

feast were given a few works. of cheer
and appreciation by the ministers of
the city. Brief talks were made by
Revs. Gross, . Herndon and Stephens,
and Mr. Gross invoked divine guid-
ance and protection for the young
soldiers.
. Another pretty and inspiring cere -
mony took place when seven of the
most charming members of Ocala's
budding young womanhood went
around among the boys and on the
breast of each pinned a dainty bou-
quet and a white ribbon. It will not

ceived by the Star from El Paso was
read. It, told of the, attack of Mexi-
cans on Americans, the. killing of
forty of our men and the capture of
seventeen. Be it said to the credit of
the boys that the news did not seem

for the occasion, the national colors j pany rolled in. The Ocala boys climb

which brought a storm of cheers.
Then came, "O, Say Can You See by
the Dawn's Early Light," and all
heads were bared and the eyes of
those present involuntarily turned to
ward the Flag. , s - - -
A social commingling followed and
lasted until, the men had to begin to
make preparations for leaving. Ev
erybody seemed bright and cheerful,
tho some of the mothers present had
to smile with Spartan courage thru
their tears as their eyes followed with
fear mingled, with pride every move
ment of their soldier sons.
At 11 o'clock there was a call, and
the soldiers began picking up their
guns and 'equipments and moving to
ward the street.' Soon they stood in
double line before the armory, await
ing the order to march, while their
friends waited with them.

CONDITION II!
WW COUNTY
Of Dixie Highway and Paradise Loop
Reported at Orlando by Rep
resentatives from Ocala
At the meeting of the Central
Florida Highway Association in Or
lando today, a report on the condition
of the Dixie Highway and Paradise
Loop in Marion county will be made
through Mr. J. J. Gerig, acting for
Mr. J.. D. Rooney, director for this
county. -The report, prepared by
Louis H. Chazal, president of the
Marion county council of the Dixie
Highway association, states that the
two branches of the great highway
are in good condition, and that where
there are rough places repairs will be
made. V,
At the recent meeting of the Cen
tral Florida Highway association in
Ocala, a resolution was adopted call
ing for a report from each county in
the center of the state on the condi
tion of the highway, with a view of
changing the route in the case of
counties failing to carry out their
pledges to provide and up-keep the
stretches of road within their . boun
daries.
The report for Marion county fol
lows: .
J. D. Rooney, Director for Marion
County, Central Florida Highway
Association, Ocala, Fla. .
My dear Mr. Rooney: I herewith
give you a report on the condition of
the Dixie Highway, and of -Paradise
Loop, in Marion county, in order that
you might, in turn, report to the Cen
tral Florida Highway association at
its annual meeting in "Orlando, June
22. .
The roads in this county designated
as the main line of the Dixie High
way, from the Alachua to the Lake
county line, and s the Paradise Loop
from Ocala to the Citrus county line,
are hard-surfaced roads that have
been down for some time, and many
of the members of the Central Flor
ida Highway association have been
over them. The general condition of
these roads is at present good. Where
there are any rough places the county
commissioners, according to Mr. W.
Cam, chairman, will have repairs
made at once. There is a rather
rough stretch of about a mile within
the corporate limits of Reddick, and
I have, through Mr. C. M. Cam, taken
up with the citizens of that place the
question of putting the stretch in
good shape. I feel confident that, ac
tion will be taken in the matter.
Commissioner Cam informs me
that the main line of the Dixie High- .
way for 22 miles north of the Lake
county line has been contracted out
for up-keeping, and that the commis
sioners hope very shortly to contract
for the up-keep of the balance of the
highway in this county. The com
missioners hope to make a contract
for the up-keep of the Paradise Loop
by the first of the year. This, is in
addition to the repairs" that I have al
ready mentioned.
The commissioners, I am pleased to
report, have agreed to purchase and
p?ace along the Dixie Highway the
Dixie Highway the official markers,
and a contract has just been awarded
for 100 reinforced concrete posts for
the markers.. The posts will be used,
too, as mile posts. A hundred of the
markers have been ordered.
It will probably be of great interest
to the members of the Centrat'Flor
ida Highway association to know
that Marion, one of the pioneer good
roads counties of the state, having at
present over 200 miles of hard-
