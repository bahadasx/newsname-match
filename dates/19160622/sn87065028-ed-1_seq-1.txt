Note Rejecting Carranza's
Demands Has Been Dis
patched by Lansing.
Columbus,' N. M., June 21. Car
ranza soldiers and troops of General
Pershing's command south of Nami
quipa are on the verge of hostilities,
according to reports from the field
tonight. A wireless dispatch from
Col. Cabell, General Pershing's
chief of staff, said that American
motor truck supply trains are in
danger of being fired upon by Car
ranzH soldiers.
The Mexicans are said to have
mounted artillery in positions men
acing the Americans and dispatches
indicate that with the two commands
in cloco proximity the danger of a
clash is increasing.
Persistent rumors were in eircula
ton here tonight that General Ter
shing has split his command into
three columns, each prepared to
move in the event of hostilities,
while others said that truck trains
had been fired upon. No confirma-

San Antonio, Texas, June 21.
With the arrival of national guards
men which General Funston today
asked the War Department to send
to the border as quickly as possible,
it is believed that an American force
of approximately 70,000 men 'v'l1
be stationed along the international
boundary within a week, facing the
army of the de facto Mexican
government.
General Funston did not announce
today how many troops he had asked
for nor the stations to which they
will be sent, but it is known that he
expects more than a division and it
i3 said that not less than 28,000 will
be sent. Advices received at army
headquarters late today indicated
that the first of the reinforcements
would entrain early tomorrow.
The border army, already made
up of troops of the regular estab
lishments and the militiamen of
Texas, New Mexico and Arizona,
comprises more than 4D.000 troops.
The army already patrolling the
international line is prepared to re
sist any aggression the Mexican
forces might make, but it was dem
onstrated sometime ago that it was
not big enough to guard the long line
from Brownsville to the Pacific and
army officers never have regarded it
as strong enough to undertake the
invasion in force. General Funston's
request for the-guardsmen was for
"a number sufficient to give ade
quate protection to the border."
Officers at his headquarters also felt
that with this increased force oper
ations in Mexico on a big scale might
be undertaken, but in the event of
intervention or any action making
r-ie.5?ary a general forward move
ment into Mexico, General Funston
explained that he would ask immed
iately for the remainder of the 100,
000 guardsmen called to service this
week.
Washington, June 21. A note
signed by Secretary Lansing convey

the demands for the withdrawal of
American soldiers from Mexico, ac

Recruiting Will Begin Soon,
and Men will Be Ready to
Answer Volunteer Call.
Sharing the patriotism and desire
for public service which has been
apparent throughout the country
since President Wilson issued his
call to members of the national
guard, Capt. T. H. Sharp and Mr.
J. G. Weatheily, of this city, have
decided to raise u company of in-
fantry, and will offer their sor-jjK
vices should a call for volunteers be
issued.
Capt. Sharp is a scion of a fam
ily noted for bravery on the field
of battle, being a son of the late
Gen. J. H. Sharp, who was one of
the most noted Confederate gener
als of the civil war. Capt. Sharp,
who is at present postmaster, has
himself had valuable military exper
ience, having commanded a com
pany of volunteers during the re
cent war with Spain. Mr. Weather
ly is secretary of the local Chamber
of Commerce, nnd is a patriotic and
public spirited citizen, lie is a native
of the south and posseses the brav
ery and valor for which this section
is noted.
Plans to organize the company
are being rapidly matured, and the
organization will in all likelihood
be mobilized here. Capt. Sharp will
be in command, while Mr. Weather
ly will serve as first lieutenant, and
other officers will be selected after
organization has been completed.

PETROGRAD DECLARES AUS-
TIAN ARMY CUT INTO
BY RUSSIAN ADVANCE.
London, June 21. The Russians,
continuing their advance against
the Austrians in Bukowina, have
rossed the Sereth river southwest
of Czernowitz, and occupied the
towns of Zadova, StroigneU and
GlroeVa. The Austrians in Vhis re
gion, their army cut into, are de-
!red by Petrograd to be in d:sor-
deiiy retreat, with the Russians en-
.etically pursuing them t'-wvid
the Carpathian mountains.
An element of uncertainty as to
the situation between the Pripet
river and the Galacian frontier has
ariseno wing to the divergent report
of the Russian and German war of
fices, both of which claim successes
for their armies. Northeast of Kiser
lin, between Lutsk and the Vladimir-
Volynski railway, Petrograd say an
Austrian attack, supported by Ger
mans, was repulsed, while Berlin in
serts that the Tutonic allies were vic
torious ana are ngnting their way
forward against the Russians.
In Oalacia, the Austrians and
wermuns are sun desperately ro
sining the Rusian attempts to press
forward towards Lemberg.
In general the situation on the
other war fronts is unchanged.
In the region of Fort Vaux, north
east of Verdun, there has been rath
er lively artillery fighting and bom
bardments, and mining operations
have taken place along the remain
der of the French front.

SUICIDE OF ATTORNEY

PROBATE JUDGE.
UNJUSTLY LINKED
WITH THE MURDER
Military Company Guards
Jail While Special Grand
Jury Investigates Situation.
iluotsville, Ala., has been stirred
from center to circumfrence by a
sensational murder and on equally
sensational suicide which have taken
place there during the punt few days,
the finding of the lifeless body of
Probate Judge W. T. Lawler, who
was killed by political enemies, huv-
been quickly followed by the
suicide of Shelby S. Pleasants, a
prominent attorney of that city.
Even the palate of Huntsville,
satiated during the past week by
the sensational, was not proof
against this bolt from the blue and
the town ceased motion for a minute
with a gasp of horror.
Simultaueosuly with the death of
Mr. Tleasaiits came the announce
ment of the surrender to the author
ities of Charles M. Nails, the circuit
court clerk who was wanted in con
nection with the murder of Judge
Lawler, but it scarcely created a rip
ple. Had a Huntsville man been asked
what was the thing least likely to
happen it is quite probable that he
would without an instant of deliber
ation have named the very thing
which occurred with dramatic sud
denness on Monday afternoon. It
should be borne in mind that Pleas
ant's name had not been mentioned
in connection with the murder of
Judge Lawler. He was connected
with neither foctiott' ai.d took no In-

Pleasants was a Republican and
made no attempt to participate in
Democratic primaries. He had even
refrained from expressing an opin
ion on the Lawler case and so far as
could be ascertained had not been
unduly interested in the matter.
Consequently the note which he left
was piling Pelion upon the Ossa of
his death.
The note was taken in charge by
Coroner Toole and later turned over
to relatives who withheld it from
publication. The sense of the note
however, became public property.
Briefly, the note declared that the
writer had been f!sely accused of
connection with the crime, that he
was wholly innocent, that he had
been suffering from nervous prostra
tion for five years and that he was
unable to stand it longer. The note
concluded with a plea for forgive
ness.

PASSED AWAY AT HOME OF
SON-IN-LAW YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON.
Capt. E. IL Sprague, an old and
highly respected citizen, died at the
home of his son-in-law, Mr. T. L.
Lawrence, about one mile west of
Columbus on the Robertson road at
3:.10 o'clock yesterday afternoon. He
had been in bud health for quite a
long time, and his death was by no
means unexpected.
Capt. Sprague was one of the best
known railroad men in this section,
and his death is a source of profound
regret not only to members of the
family but to countless friends.' He
was a native of Indiana, but came to

THE LAST COUNT i
Assessor Vaughn Think Som
Children Were Overlooked
and wil! Muk Recount.
Acting upon the assumption tli.it
many ai'olc.-vt M.'- were ovctlo.ed
in the recent enumeration of cduc i
ble children within the 'orders of
Lowndes county, whieh shoved a
falling off of something like .1,000 as
compared to a similar enumeration
made four years ao, Tax A essor
George W. Vaughn, who under the
law is in charge of work of this
character, is preparing to make a
recount, and confidently believes
that the new count will show un ap
preciable increase over the one whieh
has just been completed.
Shou'd the count, whieh was re
cently completed, prove to be cor
rect, it wouiu nave a most tie-as-,
trous effect upon local educational
interes's, as it would serve to reduc '
Lowndes county's share of the state
school fund something like $54,000
This fund is distributed quadrennial
ly, and the share of each county is
based upon the number of educahle
children therein.
Tax Assessor Vaughn has been in
bad heulth practically every since his
induction into office, and the recent
enumeration was made by two a
sistants. While these assistants are
both good men, they lucked exper
ience, and it is thought that many
children of educable age were over
looked. In fact, "Mr. Vaughn and
President IluU'liutt, of the Uoard of
Supervisors, who nrc making sn in

there was a gratifying response on
