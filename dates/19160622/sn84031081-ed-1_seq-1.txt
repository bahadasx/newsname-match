of Mexican Battle
nt ionih jou.nai. trtQinL liaiio mom
.Washington, June 21. General
Funston transmitted to the war de
partment the following report from
General Rell at Kl Paso:
"There was a clash at Carrizdl. near
j Villa Ahumada, between Carranza and
Annricun troops, in which General
Gomei and other Mexicans were killed.
itho number unknown. Number of
Americans killed or wounded un
known.
"General Gomez sent a captain with
an order to the American commander
to go back, but the American com
mander said he was going to Villa
Abuinada, and opened fire on the
Mexican cuptnln, wounding him.
Americans attacked General Gomez
but were thrown back.'1
"Prisoners were sent to Chihuahua.
"Garcia says this was telephoned
lit request of General Gonzales.
"An Amerboi), who was on the
train today passing Villa Ahumada
at 2:30, said lie saw several dead
Mexicans put on bis train, union,' thom
a dead Mexican genera. There were
also seveval Mexican woundod. He
gathered from talk there that the
fight was with American cavalry, nine
miles west and thai the Americans
were decoyed into a rtup by the use
of a Mexican flats of truce, and they
were then fired upon by a machine,
gun. Report states that our troops
engaged was the Tnth cavalry."
expressions or acts which might appear
forerunners of a declaration of wur.
The only answer required from Gen.
eral Carranza Is action suppressing
outlaw treatment of Americans, and
officials feared against hopo that this
would not be done.
Military authorities were looking
for the de faen government' attitude
in Mexico threatening troop move
ments near the border today, and in
'preparation for these the war depart
ment wis getting ready to act on
General Fuiislon'n request for immed
iate dispatch of a number of national
guard unita to the border. It was
said Secretury Raker and President
Wilson probably would determine
what organisations should be sent.
Several days muy elapse before any
great number of militia units can be
mustered Into the federal service. Ke
poru of great enthusiasm and rapid
recruiting continued to come in from
many stntes t"jy,t . ,,, h
reat interest Was expressed In the
probable course to be followed in case
Mexicans attack the American column.
It was regarded as probably that a
general rapid advance would be order
ed from the border to a liin perhaps
100 or more miles south of the border.
This line, then would be fortified and
held until volunteer reinforcements
became available. Thus fighting
would be. thrown Into the enemy's ter
ritory and the border protected
against further t bandit attacks by
thorough policing of the country be
hind the main line.
A special train bearing several hun
dred American refugees from Mexico
City to Vera Cru. was to leave Mexico
City today, according to word from
Special Agent Kcxlgers at the Mexican
capital.

can, was not definitely known heretOnight, but
nearly a score of General Pershing's Wen are said
to have been killed and the Mexicans are said to
have lost more than two score. Seventeen Ameri
cans are said to have been captured and to have
been hurried to Chihuahua City under adequate
guard. A machine gun used by the Mexicans is
reported to have done heavy execution.
Mexican Numbers Unknown.
The Americans engaged are thought to have
been members of a troop from the Tenth cavalry,
a negro regiment, returning from a scouting trip
to Guzman. The size of the Mexican force, whose
commander, General Felix Gomez, was killed, is
not known.
Xews of the battle was received in Juarez early
this afternoon by General Francisco Gonzales,
Carranza commander of the military zone of the
border. For some reason or other, General Gon
zales kept the story secret until late in the after
noon, when an American, J. C. Hupped, returning
to the border from the interior, brought to El
Paso the news that he had seen numbers of Mexi-
can dead
along
track at Villa
Ahumada
there had been an encounter with the "gringos.'
Americans Are Blamed.
General Gonzales' first step after confirming
the news was to issue a statement placing the
blame on the American commander. He charged
that the American troops fired first on the Mexi
cans and that their shots were directed at a cour
ier who had just presented to them a request that
they retire.
American army officers declared absolute dis
belief tonight in General Gonzales' assertions.
The opinion was expressed that if the Americans
fired on the Mexicans they did so because it was
necessary in order to insure their own safety. Gen-
