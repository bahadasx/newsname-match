Baker Is Rushing Out Mcs
sages Learning State of
Mobilization, Belief.
TTahimrtnn, .Inne 2-. While the
gn?ernnient hud no official con-
tirmaUnn early today ot .Mexican
report lhat American and Mexi
can troops were in a battle yes
terday with heaTV losses on the
American side, there was a stir of
mm purpose about the war and
slate departments.
Secretary Baker conferred with
President Wilson on the hat is of re
ports given out by Mexican command
ers a: the border and transmitted to
the state department. Later Secre
tary Lansing was cloaeted with the
war secretary and afterward Mr. Ba
ker hastened to the capitol for con
ferences with the congressional mili
tary military committee chairmen.
No explanation for these confer
ences was given. It. was learned, how
ever, that telegraph wires were hot
with inrjuirieo sent to various gnvcr
liors seeking reports of the number
of national guard regiments mobil
ized and available frr immediate scr
vire Officials said President Wilson would
await a definite report of what lias
happened from General Pershing. It
was not expected until late today, as
the town of Carrizai is mi miles or
more from General Pershing's ad
vance base at Namiquipa.
Policy I'n hansred.
At the White house it was said the
president's policy was unchanged for
the present at least and that Mr. Wil
son hail no intention of going before
congress immediately.
Secretary Baker said no marching
orders had gone to national guard
units. Nothing could he done, he de
clared, until a report from Ameri
can sources had been received. Oth
er officials took the same view. There
were no efforts to conceal the anxiety
with which the situation was viewed.
Kxpcct Pershing Word.
General Pershing's interpretation of
the tight with the Carranza troops and
American cavalry near Carranza!,
Mexico, yesterday, expected momen
tarily today, probably will determine
largely whether the incident will pre
cnpiate immediate war.
If his report, dec-lares the American
soldiers were attac ked in an apparent
attempt to enforc e General Carranza's
demand that the 1'nited States troop
movements be only north toward the
border, it. is considered probable the
clash will be accepted by President
Wilson as an act of war.
Accept Stories of Clash.
Reports from Mexican sources tell
ing of the dash but not disc losing
American casualties were accepted by
officials as fairly authentic, although
none would believe that the Americans
made the tjrst attack. The reports in
creased the tensity that has existed
over Mexican relations for many
months.
Pending receipt of General Funs
ton's report. President Wilson consid
ered the situation seriously. He was
equally anxious to reecive from Mex
ico some indic ation of Carranza's atti
tude toward the American note sent
Tuesday.

was killed and two wounded in a fight
here this morning between a squad of
special police and a crowd of I. W. W.
strikers who were on their way to
picket the Alpena mine of the Oliver
Iron Mining company. More than
fifty shots were fired some of them by
a woman armed with a repeating rifle,
who stood on the porch of a miner's

Being Steadily Swelled
During Day.
Springfield, 111., June 22. How
soon will the Illinois troops be
ordered south? That was the predom
inating topic of discussion today among
the 12,000 or 13,000 infantry troops
which will come tomorrow from all
parts of the state to the mobilization
camp here, among the 2,000 already
mobilized cavalry troops and among
civilians throughout the city.
Adjutant General Dickson and his
staff at the state house and Brigadier
General D. Jack Foster and his staff at
the mobilization camp had nothing to
say in this regard, all their eflorts be
ing confined to bringing the state
troops up to the standard of efficiency
of United States regulars as speedily
as possible.
General Dickson was up at sunrise
yesterday, was busy at his office until
midnight and was up soon after sun
rise again today. A final inspection of
Camp Dunne by General Dickson, Sur
geon General Jacob Frank and other
'high officers has convinced them that
the camp is in excellent condition.
Lipiit Trains From ( hicag-o.
Eight special troop trains from Chi

and four over the Illinois Central lines
were due here at half hour intervals
beginning at 7 o'clock this morning,
and about an equal number of trains
were to bring the downstate regiments.
This afternoon or early tomorrow
the infantry will be turned over to the
following instructors: Lieutenant Col

and Captain William H. Patterson.
"The rookies will be put through the
hardest kind of work from the very

"for that is the best way to toughen
them."
General Dickson outlined today what
probably would be the procedure in
the event of an immediate call of the
Illinois militia to the border. The
units specified in the war department's
orders, he said, would take their entire
personnel to the point of concentration
There, however, the raw recruits would

Washington,, June 22. An official
communication from the Mexican for

tween Mexican and American troops
at Carrizai and saying tM fic facto
government found it difficult to un
derstand why the Americans should
have been so far away from their
base, was delivered to Secretary Lan
sing today by Eliseo Arredondo, the
Mexican ambassador designate.
Arredondo asked for an explanation
of the action of American troops ap
proaching the town of Carrizai.
Secretary Lansing had no official
information ou which to discuss the
Carrizai affair, and, according to Mr.
Arredondo also was without knowl
edge of whether any Mexican towns
actually had been occupied.
Official Mexican dispatches were de
scribed to Secretary Lansing indicat
ing that the Mexican forces thought
the American troops who approached
Carrizai intended to take the town.
Mr. Arredondo said he called Secre
tary Lansing's attention to the dis
tance traversed by the American
troops from their base and to what he
called "the lack of prudence of the
American commander in approaching
the Mexican railway."
He said his reports showed that 17
American soldiers had been captur
ed, but did not give the number of
casualties among either the Ameri
can or the Mexican forces.

TAVENNER VICTOR
IN HIS FIGHT ON
THE STOP WATCH
(Special to the Argus.)
Washington, D. C, June 22. After
one of the most exciting and bitter
fights that congress has seen for many
weeks, the house today adopted the
Tavenner amendment to the fortifica
tion bill by a vote of 197 to 115. Con
gressman Tavenner, Illinois, conduct
ed the fight in favor of his amendment
and Congressman Brown of Wisconsin
conducted the opposition fight. Various
members of. congress participated in
the debate. Scores of members came
on the floor with telegrams in their
pockets from manufacturers in oppo
sition to the bill prohibiting the use
of the stop watch. Congressman Dal
linger of Massachusetss, offered
an amendment to the Tavenner
provision which would have provided
that the Taylor system could be used
in arsenals unless a majority of the
workmen protested in working.
Representative Tavenner stated he
was not opposed to the principle of
the Dallinger amendment, but opposed
it on the ground that workmen would
fear to openly oppose the introduc
tion of the system lest their ratings or
jobs suffered. He called attention to
the fact that the majority of the com
mittee that came to Washington to
protest against the Taylor system are
not now at the arsenal. The Dallin
ger amendment was finally defeated
by a majority of four votes.

Funston Taking Precautions Along Border
, Awaiting Further News of Fray.
San Antonio, Tex., June 22. General Funston has
sent a message to General Pershing urging him to expe
dite his report of the Carrizai fight.
General Funston's reports as late as 10 o'clock had
added nothing to his information of last night concern
ing the fight at Carrizai. General Pershing's account of
the clash was momentarily e xpected.
El Paso, June 22. The Americans lost 12 dead, in
cluding their commander, and 17 prisoners, while 14 Mex
icans were killed and 30 wounded in the battle of Car
rizai, according to the official announcement today at the
Mexican consulate, which said it had received complete
details from Villa Ahumada. The Americans removed
their wounded with them. The name of the American
commander still is unknown. The bodies of the American
dead were counted as they lay on the field of battle.
Juarez, the Mexican town across
the Rio Grande from here, was
more than half evacuated at 10
o'clock today by the Carranza gar
rison. It was officially reported on
this side that three train loads of
soldiers had gone southward dnr
inp the early morning, and that
three more trains had been loaded
in preparation for departure. '
American army officials ex
pressed the opinion that evacua
tion w ould be completed during the
day nntil the Mexicans were be
yond the range of the American
artillery.
General Bell, instead of going to
Fort Bliss this morning, remained
downtown, with temporary head
quarters at the Toltec club, where
he lives.
EI Paso, Tex., June 22. Evacuation
of Juarez by the Carranza garrison
was expected today as a result of yes
terday's battle between troops of the
Tenth cavalry and a Carranza com
mand at Carrizai.
Reports to General George Bell, Jr.,
commanding the El Paso military dis
trict, indicated that hurried prepara
tions for the departure of 4,000 troops
under General Francisco Gonzales,
were made in Juarez throughout the
night.
Captain James Allison, provost mar
shal of El Paso, received a report from
a Mexican source early today that the
evacuation was already under way and
that one train of box cars and day
coaches, heavily loaded with soldiers
had left for the south over the Mexican
Central line.
All night the streets in Juarez were
filled with cavalrymen, a number of
small detachments moving from the
city and into the hills beyond, while
others left Juarez, ostensibly to take
station at border points within a few
miles of El Paso.
Await Details of Clash.
Details of the engagement at Carri
zai were awaited anxiously here.
General Bell said early today that no
reports had been received from Gen
eral Pershing, the American expedi
tionary commander. The American
version was expected later in the day.
Stress was laid upon the fact that the
battle was fought approximately 65
miles from Colonia Duulaii, General
Pershing's field headquarters and that
with wire communication unavailable
it would take a courier some time to
reach the expeditionary commander.
Carranza Leader Slain.
A new version of the engagement
was brought here today by a Mexican
civilian, who was in Villa Ahumada
early yesterday afternoon and who
said he assisted in dressing some of
the Mexican wounded. He said that
General Felix Gomez, the slain Car
ranza leader, had been aware of the
approach of the Americans for 21 hours
and had sent a number of couriers to
them warning them to return to their
encampment
When they persisted in their ad
vance, he said, a pitfall several hun
dred feet in length wan dug directly
in the trail over which the, cavalrymen
must ride. This was cleverly hidden
with brush.
As the Americans rode unsuspect
ingly through the sand dunes toward
the entrenchment. General Gomez lay
concealed some hundred yards away
in the mewquiie. Tho horses of the
American vanguard plunged into the

pitfall, unseating their riders and in
juring a number of them.
Capture 17, Kill 40 Americans.
Then, the Mexicans asserted, the
Carranza forces lying in ambush raked
the American ranks with a machine
gun. The heavy fire forced the
Americans to withdraw to reorganize
their line and the Mexicans captured
17 soldiers who had been thrown into
the pit
He asserted that it was then that
General Gomez went forward under a
flag of truce and that before the pro
posed parley had begun an Irrespons
ible soldier again started the machine
gun fire.
A small detachment of cavalrymen
charged toward General Gomez and
his party, who were in the center of a
field, directly between the two com
mands, their pistol fire killing the
Mexican leader.
Mexican Dead Unknown.
According to the story both com
mands withdrew. The Mexican waa
unable to estimate the Mexican dead
but asserted that the American dead
numbered 40, his statement agreeing In
this respect with Mexican official re
ports. No information concerning the en
gagement other than that from Mexi
can sources has been received. Even
the two Americans, James Maxey and
J. C. Hubble, following the engage
ment in Villa Ahumada. which is nine
miles from the Santo Domingo ranch
on which the battle took place and
who brought the most detailed ac
counts to the border, said their in
formants were all Mexicans.
Funston I'nder Strain.
San Antonio. Tex., June 22. General
Funston's headquarters reflected early
today the unrelieved strain in the
American-Mexican situation. The
night had passed without news from
General Pershing and army officers
here professed to see a remaining
chance that war might be averted.
Frank skepticism was aroused by the
suggestion that General Gomez might
not have been attempting to enforce
the Carranza edict by force. It was
pointed out that his determination to
force the Americans back to their own
line was indicated by the official ad
mission that he had sent a messenger
to the American commander advising
him to withdraw.
General Funston spent the night in
efforts- to learn more details f what
occurred at Carrizai.
Staff officers scrutinized carefully
every report that came from officers in
command at border stations.
News that Juarez was being evacu
ated by the Mexican garrison did not
surprise' the headquarters staff, who
yesterday learned that General Ricaut
had removed his forces at Matamoros
and that similar action had been taken
at other towns.
In no case, however, did the Mexi
can forces moved far south of the bor
der. At Piedrus Negras, opposite Eagte
Pass, the garrison was increased by
the arrival of General Francisco Mur
gia with 2,000 troops, mostly Yaquis.
Additional troops were added to the
garrison at Ojinaga, opposite Presidio
and from Nogales also was reported a
heavy concentration in the interior.
None of the reported Mexican troop
movements caused anxiety at army
headquarters, however.
