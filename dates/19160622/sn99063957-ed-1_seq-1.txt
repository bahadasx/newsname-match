were captured. Goner g lix Gomez
was wounded and died ; - the battle.
The war office anno I that the
clash was caused by General Pershing's
defiance of the instructions recently
transmitted to him by General Trevino
that any further advance into Mexico
would be forcibly resisted.
General Gomez, the Carranza com
mander killed in action, was born in
Vauegas, Kan Luis Potosi, and joined
the Carranza revolutionists three years
ago. He was on the staff of General
Gutierrez and accompanied Guiterrez to
the capital when the latter was elected
provisional president by Mexican
chiefs. When Gutierrez fled the cnpital,
Gomez followed him and took the field
against Villa. He later surrendered to
General Jacinto Trevino. For several
months he has been operating under
General Trevino in western Chihuahija.
It is to be noted that the Mexican
war office anuouncea the engagement
occurred on Sunday. All dispatches

Mexican Officials Sore
Over Tone of Wilson Note
State Mexican Side of It
Mexico City, June 22. Mexican of
ficials today generally resented the tone
of the American note njid pointed out
what they declured to be fallacies in
President Wilson's argument.
The text of the note had not been
made public at nn early hour today.
General Carranza and his cmiinet
studied the communication in a lengthy
special session yesterday, denying them
selves to all visitors.
No formal statement was given out,
but the I'uited Press today obtained the
view of a number of .Mexican officials
who know the contents of the note.
Summed up, the Mexican attitude is ns'

By Carl D. ffroat
(Tutted Press staff correspondent)
Washington, June 22. IW-.'M pm.)
Hampered by the fact that all reports
up to this hour telling of the killing
of. 12 Americans and the capture of 17
in the fight at Carrizal yesterday come
from Mexican sources, the United States
wa9 rushing preparations this afternoon
for any action that may be necessary
in the latest crisis with the Carrnnzista
government.
Press dispatches Teported that Gen
eral Pershing, commanding the Amer
ican expedithion in Mexico, is without
details of the engagement which bord
er accounts described as an ambush.
Against the border stories is the of
ficial eluim of the Mexican govern
ment, backed up by Ambassador Arre
dondo in a call upon Secretary Lansing
that the American forces were respon
sible for the clash. Through his am
bassador, Carranza sought an explana
tion of the presenco of the United
States troops so far from their head
quarters. Iteports from Columbus state thnt
Captain Lewis S. Moiey was in com
mand of the detachment of the Tenth
cavalry which engaged the Cnrranzistna.
The latest Mexican reports declared the
American. commander was killed,
It is believed that survivors of the
cavalry detachment will have returned
to their base lute this afternoon and
thnt General rershing's complete report
will be in the hands of the war depart
ment before tomorrow.
The militia forces of three states
were ordered to the border today. Fol
lowing a conference with President Wil
sm. Secretary of War Baker announced
that 11 other militia bodies called but
will be rushed to the border us rapidly
as they can be equipped.
General Funston, directing the move
ments of the forces concentrating along
the Mexican frontier, marked time also,
awaiting word from Pershing.
Since the American note was dis
patched to Mexico City, no official hint
lias come from Currnnzn, 'a capital of
the nature of his reply. A special truin

City to Vera Cruz today,' but 2,"A) others

"We warmly challenge the statement
that constitutionalist troops have not
co-operated with the Americans to pre

war, asked information concerning the
plans of the American expedition in or

tion was refused, leaving him unable to
take such measures except at k great
disadvantage.
" We indignantly deny that Carrnn

except on their own initiative. Furth
ermore, no soldiers now belonging to
the constitutionalist army part icijwted
in any raids,
"The fact that one raider was founJ

that some of the raiders wore constitu

Washington, June 22. As fast as the
different state militia units can be
equipped, they will be sent to the bord

lowing a conference with President
Wilsou.
As to who go 'first and where they
will be assigned, the secretary said he
could not state; titer will bo dispatched
as quickly and in the order in which
they make themselves ready, ho said.
General Mills, ' head of the militia
division of the war department, is keep
ing in direct touch with the organiza
tion of the different units and is being
atlvised ns to the progress of prepara
tions for movement.
The secretary stated that beyond this
no conclusions had been reached nor
plans made ns a result of the latest
Mexican development.
''We are awaitini? further

just what happened and it would be
unwise to make or announce any plans
until we do."
The secretary said it would not neces

await comulote reports from Pershing
himself, which may be delayed before
determining upon a course of action, if
accurate information can be secured

If Conflict Comes It Will Be

By Robert J. Bender.
(Tinted Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, June 22. Until it is
definitely established that there is an
organized effort, by Carranza troops to
attack or harass American forces in
northern Mexico, no change in President
Wilson 's policy toward Mexico is likely,
callers learned today.
The president is awaiting complete

foundation.
The president understands that the
principal danger is from individuals in
northern Mexico who are armed, ex
citable nnd likely to attack a force of
Americans at any time. This apparently
is appreciated also by General Carrnn
za, it Is believed, because copies of re
cent orders issued by him, show that
the first chief is attempting to get
all armed bandits in northern Mexico
to enlist in his army. This is to pre
vent individual forays.
Telegrams by the score wero received
by the president. They wero about
equally divided in urging immedinte
action in the Mexican situation nnd in
begging him to avoid war with Car

said, the ship is entirely feasible.
Indications were that the committee
