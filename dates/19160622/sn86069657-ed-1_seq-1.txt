Woman Suffrage
Is Party Plank
The Democratic National con
vention finished its work Friday
at St. Louis by'adoptiug the par
ty platform exactly as approved
by President Wilson and submit
ted by the resolution committee,
including the plank on Ameri.
canism and that favoring woman
suffrage but not until the harmo
ny of its three days' session hmi
been disturbed with a row over
the suffrage plank. No voico
was raised against the vigorous
declarations of the Americanism
plank, but at one time it looked
as if the sniTrage plank had been
lost. After Senator Walsh of Mon
tana had told the convention that.
President Wilson himself consid
ed it vital to party success, it was
voted iuto the platform by a bal
lot of 888 to lbli. The entire
platform then was adopted with
oat roll call.
As it went iuto the platform
the suifrage plank stands:
"Wo favor the extension of
the franchise to the women of
this country, state by state, on
the same terms as to the men."
