The restlessness of the flat dweller
is a national mystery. Why does lie
go forth inevitably in the spring to
find another flat and to insert his fam

as not it Is the flat which he aban
doned five years ago. Since then he
occupied four other Hats, each a vast
improvement over its predecessor, and
he is now delighted with the new fiat
which he left in disgust five years ago.
He litis spent hundreds of dollars In
arriving at this stage*of happiness, but

year and flit on In a moving van as

Mystery of a
Jade Ring
Chinese Jewel Leads to a
Romance In America
By CLARISSA MACKIE
The red auction flag fluttered over
the door of the Japanese shop. Always
fascinated by the charm of oriental
I hings. Leslie Marston thrust aside the
knowledge that her father was waiting
to luucb with her downtown and step
ped inside the shop.
The auctioneer was holding a small
ivory box containing a uuique ring of
twisted gold dragons set with an ob
long tablet of carved jade.
"And 1 am offered only $5." he re
proached the crowd.
"Please let me examine the ring," re
quested Leslie. She felt a great desire
to possess the ornament Her month's
allowance was in her handbag. She
recognized the ring ns a beautiful ex
ample of Chinese jewel craft.
"Ten dollars," she said, returning the
ring.
"Twelve," said a determined voice.
Leslie looked up and saw a broad
shouldered, dark young man leaning
against the wall. Grim and unsmiling,
It was very evident that he, too, want
ed the jade ring.
Leslie, spoiled darling of fortune,
wanted It also.
"Fifteen." said Leslie crisply.
"Sixteen," he came back.
"Eighteen." was Leslie's bid.
"Nineteen." said the man doggedly.
"Twenty-five." Leslie felt excited by
this little adventure.
"Twenty-five—I am offered only $25
for this beautiful ring," said the auc
tioneer contemptuously. "Why, it is
worth five times as much! Won't you
raise it, sir?" he appealed to the dark
young man.
The latter shook his head. His lips
were a straight line.
A new voice raised the bid to $30.
Leslie saw a tall, lean Chinese dressed
in black garments.
The bidding rose steadily until the
Chinaman dropped out of the contest,
and the ring was sold to Leslie for $00.
As she left the shop some one jostled
her. She glanced up and saw the yel
low countenance of the Chinaman glar
ing down at her.
"You no want ring—you sell to me!"
he commanded arrogantly.
Before Leslie could reply a strong
arm pushed the oriental aside.
"Is this man annoying you?" asked
the dark young man of the auction
room.
"He spoke to me," faltered Leslie. "1

believe be wants tbe jade ring. Will
you please call a taxicab?"
In a moment be bad signaled a taxi
and placed her In it, stepping back
with bared bead.
"1 am sorry about tbe ring," cried
Leslie hastily, and her cheeks burned
as lie shook his head.
"It's all right," lie said cheerfully as
she rolled away.
All the way downtown Leslie Mars
ton, who had never thought seriously
about any man, was thinking about
tbe young stranger who had wanted
the jade ring and who had intervened
when the Chinaman annoyed her.
Arrived at her father's offices in the
Goliath bnildiug, it was a distinct
shock to fiud the young stranger in
conférence with her father.
"Ah, Leslie," cried Mr. Marston,
drawing her to him. "I thought yon
were never coming. Let uic introduce
Mr. Delorme, my new secretary. He's
n nephew of Mrs. Fisk Delorme and
very likely you'll meet him around at
some of your junketings this season."
The young iieople shook hands, and
Leslie told her father that Jack De
torme had already been of assistance
to her.
"Some half crazed Cbinamnu," com
mented the older raau when Leslie had
finished. "Come on, Jack, and lunch
with us, and you shall tell us why ytm
wanted the jade ring."
But Jack Delorme did not tell why
he was so deeply interested In the Jade
ring, perhaps because he was more
interested In the girl who was wearing
It. It was a case of love at first
sight and that night Mr. Marston rather
ruefully confessed as ranch to his wife.
"Jack Delorme's a fine fellow," he
said, "and the sou of an old friend of
mine. They lived for years In China,
but more recently In London, where
his parents died. There was something
wrong about old John Delorme's estate
—he was supposed to be rich, but they
couldn't find any tangible evidence of
It. Jack confided to me that he Is
tracing some of the property. Leslie
doesn't have to marry money, you
know, Sara, and Jack comes of good
stock," he ended significantly.
So Leslie's parents talked It over be
tween them, while the love which had
arisen so suddenly burned steadily, a
pure, unwavering flame, during the
months that followed.
Mrs. Fisk Delorme's monthly danee$
were usually preceded by an hour's
entertainment
Leslie and her mother arrived one
evening and found the ballroom filled
with a fashionable throng which was
enjoying a clever vaudeville perform
ance. Presently a world renowned
tenor delighted them with his golden
voice, and finally a tall figure clad In
richly embroidered Chinese robes stalk
ed upon the stage.
It was the Chinese of the auction
room, the man who wanted the jade
ring. Now he was preparing to mys
tify them with feats of magic.
As one in a dream Leslie heard his
shrill staccato voice as he clacked out
the "patter" of his act, and the sound
rang in her cars long after the floor
was cleared for dancing. Jack De
lorme came In late and at once went
to Leslie.
After their second dance he took her
to the picture gallery, where they sat
down under a group of tall palms.
"I hope you are not going away,"
said the girl wistfully. "Father said
you wore growing tired of New York."
Jack turned swiftly and caught her
hands in his. "Don't any that—don't
be kind to me!" he said hoarsely. "1
can't bear it"
"Why?" whispered Leslie, with rac
ing pulses.
"Why? Because I love you—any one
must know that—and yet I cannot ask
you to marry me. I'm poor—poor as
Job's turkey! I had hoped I might
make good, but fate intervened and
took away the only chance I had."
"If I were poor you wouldn't hesi
tate?" she asked softl||r
"Ah, darling, don't tantalize me!" "he
muttered in an agonized tone. "If you
only knew how I loved you—how
much I want you for my wife! Per
haps some day when I return if you
are free—but. there, I cannot ask any
girl to wait on my uncertain fortunes."
He threw up his head proudly and
smiled. "Forget my unhappy wails,
Miss Leslie. Don't feel sorry for me."
"Ah, I can't help that," confessed
Leslie. "I must always remember you.
But please leave me alone now. I want
to think."
The long gallery was empty now
save for the slender red haired girl on
the seat under the palms.
The sound of violins came alluring
ly from the ballroom, and the slip of
feet on the polished floor was like the
rush of waves on the shore.
Lost in thought, Leslie did not hear
tlic softly padded footfalls as the Chi
nese magician approached. The yellow,
clawlike hands were over her lips be
fore she could scream out. Her eyes
were almost black with fear as she re
garded him.
"Tbe ring!" he hissed. *T want It."
She shook her head.
Holding one hand over lier lips, he
managed to rip tlie gloves from her fin
gers. Her hands were bare of rings.
With a ferocious snarl of disappoint
ed greed he flung her away from him
and vanished down the nearest stair
way.
Assailed by a new terror Leslie hnr
ried back to the ballroom and found
Jack Delorme. "I am afraid for my
father," she explained. "He saw that
1 was not wearing the ring and he
probably thinks I left it home; he will
go there and if father meets him—I am
a fraid!"
"Where Is the ring?" asked Jack
quickly.
"Here," she said, pulling a fine gold
chain from her bosom. Suspended from
the chain was the jade ring.
"But why do you wear It there?" he
asked amazedly.
A beautiful color came and went in
her cheeks, but her eyes were down
cast She did not see the look of
adoration in his eyes.
"I will take you back to your moth
er," he said, "and do not be alarmed.
I will go at once and warn your father,
and on my way I'll telephone the [k.
lice station. I will return and report
later." lie gave Leslie into lier moth
er's earc and hurried away.
Breathlessly Leslie related tbe whole
story to her mother, and to the girl's
relief Mrs. Marston insisted npon call
ing the motor and returning home at
once. They arrived shortly after Jack
Delorme reached the house.
Just as they entered the hall there
was the sound of a crashing fall over
head and two men came reel pig down
the stairs to fall in a heap at the bot
tom. Jack Delorme turned a blood
stained face toward the alarmed wo
men. His arms pinioned tbe Chinese
magician to the floor.
Two policemen came rouning from
the rear of the house, and Jack turn
ed his prisoner over to their capable
hands.
"What does this mean?" gasped Mrs
Marston. "My husband"—
"It's all right." assured Jack. "We
got here just in time. Miss Leslie's
fears were well founded. The man
hjid gained admittance to the bed
rooms and was searching systematical
ly when I tackled him. Mr. Marston
is dressing. He will be down immedi
ately."
The officers led their prisoner away,
and the family gathered in the library,
where Mr. Marston joined them.
"Well, my boy," be said to Jack, "I
owe my life to you."
"Hardly that, Mr. Marston. He
might not have reached your room,
but I really think Miss Leslie had bet
ter not wear the ring. It seems to be !
badly wanted," be smiled ruefully.
"You wanted it yourself," reminded
Leslie.
"I know, but I couldn't take it away
from you."
"Why do you want it, Delorme?"
asked Mr. Marston pointedly.
Jack paled. "It belonged to my fa
ther," he sakl reluctantly. "It was I
stolen from him by a dishonest serv
ant and brought to this country. The
thief sold it to the curio dealer. Two

men were tracing It—the thiefs con
federate, the man we have met today;
the other was myself. Neither of us
got hold of 1L Miss Leslie carried it
away under our very noses."
"But," objected Mr. Marston, "why
is the ring so valuable to you and the
other man?"
Jack hesitated. "I will tell you its
secret," he said at last, "but you must
remember that I relinquish nil claim
to it It rightfully belongs to Miss
Leslie. She bought and paid for it.'
"A secret—it has a secret?" Leslie
took the jade ring from the chain and
held it to the light. "It is a man's
ring, Mr. Delorme, and you say it be
longed to your father. You should
have it, don't you think so?" she ap
l>ealed to her parents.
They nodded emphatically.
"There!" she cried triumphantly.
"Do take your ring, Mr. Delorme. It
has only brought me III luck. You nre
the rightful owner."
"If you had not bought it the China
man would have got it," he said, tak
ing It from her hand. See!" he said
sharply.
Taking up a paper knife, he pressed
sharply on the diamond eye of the
writhing dragon. Instantly the jade
tablet swung up ou a pivot, revealin
a small compartment which was filled
by a large blazing ruby.
"Oh!" they '•borused.
"A pigeon blood ruby," said Delorme
sadly. "It belonged to my father. He
had a passion for collecting gems. He
sank a fortune in them. At last he

ring toward Leslie's father.
"It really belongs to your daughter,'
he said firmly.
"Don't he quixotic, Jack," smiled the
older man. "That ruby is your inher

"Oil, well, I can't refuse—and would

he cried, with radiant eyes.

Marston as he drew his wife out of the
room. "We will be in the drawing

The door closed behind them.
Jack came around t lie table and took
Leslie in his arms.
After a long silence she spoke.

POPULARITY OF
CONCRETE ROADS
Rapid Increase of Mileage le
Recent Years.
BOTH DURABLE AND SMOOTH
Advantages and Disadvantages Con
trasted In a New Bulletin of the De
partment of Agriculture—Advice For
Construction of Concrete Highways.
The mileage of concrete pavement In
the United States has increased rapid
ly, and It is likely to continue to in
crease, according to a new bulletin of
the department of agriculture. Tills
bulletin gives tlie estimated amount of
concrete pavement in the United States
In 1914 as 19,200,000 square yards. In
1909 it was only 304,000 square yards.
The principal advantages of concrete
pavements which have led to this in
crease in i»opularity are said to be:
Durability undef ordinary traffic con
ditions.
A smooth, even surface, offering little
resistance.
Absence of dust and ease with which
it may be cleaned.
Comparatively small cost of mainte
nance until renewals are necessary.
Availability as a base for another
type of surface if desirable.
Attractive uppearance.
The disadvantages of concrete as a
road surface are:
Its noise under horse traffic.
The wearing of the necessary joints
in the pavement and the tendency to
crack, with its consequent rapid de
terioration.
The difficulty of reputrs when these
become necessary.
In the past efforts have frequently
iteen made to overcome these objec
tions to a certain degree by covering
the concrete pavement with a bitumi
nous wearing surface. At the preseut
time tbe specialists in tbe department
bold that this cannot be economically
justified, although it is possible that
future investigation may change the
situation in this respect. In the pres
ent state of road science, however, it
seems that where traffic conditions are
such that bituminous surface on a con
crete road is practicable a bituminous
surface macadam road would lie equal
ly practicable and certainly chea[>er.
Where traffic is too heavy for macadam
road the bituminous surface Is likely
to give way and the uneven manner in
which it fails tends to produce exces
sive wear on portions of the concrete.
For a successful concrete road, hard
ness, toughness and uniformity are the
most essential qualities. These can lie
secured to a great extent by care in the
selection of the constituent materials
and tlie proportions in which they are
mixed. Tlie cement, it is said, should
always conform to some standard spec
ifications for portiaud cement, such
as those issued by the United States
bureau of standards or the American
Society For Testing Materials. The
sand should not contain more than 3
per cent of foreign material, and sand
with more coarse than fine grains is to
lie preferred. The coarse aggregate
may consist of either crushed stone or
gravel. In .either case it is very desira
ble that tlie coarse aggregate be well
graded in size ? »et ween proper limits.
Tlie proportion of cement to the sand
and coarse aggregate combined should
not be less than about one to five, nnd
tlie proj»ortion of sand to coarse aggro
gate not less than one and one-half to
three, nor greater than two to three.
A*useful formula when gravel is nsed
as coarse aggregate is one part of ce
ment to one and one-half parts of sand
to three parts of gravel. When crush
ed stone is used one and three-quar
ter parts of sand may be substituted
In place of one and one-half parts.
In addition to discussing the engi
neering details of construction the bul
letin calls attention to tbe fact that
ordinarily from one-third to one-linif of
the total cost of constructing a con
crete pavement is for labor after the
materials are delivered.
Tlie most economical method is to
have the work of mixing and placing
the concrete as nearly continuous as
practicable. The work should l>e plan
ned with a primary view of keeping
the mixer going full time. The drain
age structures, the grading and the
sub grade should, therefore, lie com
pleted well in advance of the mixer
and provision made for obtaining all
of the necessary materials without de
lay. A common error is the failure to
make adequate provision for deliver
ing water on the work and the amount
which a given stream is capable of sup
lying is frequently overestimated.
Congress and Good Roads.
"Congress will have the good roads
question to answer at its forthcoming
session, and tlie accumulating demand
from all sections of the country makes
clear that the issue must be met," as
sorts President John A. Wilson of the
American Automobile association.
"With over 2.000,000 automobiles in
use the motorists now make up
army of road users entitled to equal
consideration with all other citizens,
says Mr. Wilson. "But we have finally
obtained nearly ail those rights which
belong to the average citizen. It
I my belief that comprehensive highway«
improvement has only begun, for it
now receiving deserved attention from
growing numl>er of men who hav*
most to do with tbe affairs of tb« na
tion."
Southern Women Plan Conservation ol
Natural Growth.
With the Dixie highway, ruunini
from Chicago to Miami, ready to lx
dedicated and opened for practical pur
poses on next Thanksgiving day. th<
clubwomen of the states from the gull
to the great lakes are organizing foi
the purpose of permanently beautify
Ing this transnational highway so that
its scenic beauty from one end to tht
other will l»e a delight to the tourists.
The initial organization of tbe club
women was perfected at Guyton, Ga.
where about fifty women banded them
selves together for the purpose of as
slsting in the Dixie highway move
ment in Effingham county. Ga. Th»
movement is spreading, and it b
sought to include the clubwomen along
the entire route. The plan of the wo
men Includes the co-operation also oi
the boy scouts, the school children anc
the schoolteachers.
The first work which the women plar
is the conservation and the préserva
tion of the natural growths, trees
shrubs, flowers and grasses along tb«
route. The importance of this work
the women say. cannot be overestimat
ed, and they are seeking immediate ac
tion.
To nse the preseut growth as a key
îote and fill with masses until tht
grouping is that of Mother Nature her
self is the plan and calls for tlie util
lzatlon of every natural advantage or
the way from Chiago to Miami.
One effective plan being carried ou*
by a woman's club is to secure the ac
five co-operation of tlie various com
punies of boy scouts, giving each com
pany a section of the highway to beau
tify by carrying away rubbish, cutting
down weeds and planting trees. Kact

to a particular boy scout company if

and teachers as well as tlie clubwomer.
will make such plantings. No digging
and no transplanting will be done ex
cept under expert and skilled super
vision.
GOOD ROAD MANAGEMENT. J
Summarized briefly, the essen
tials to successful state highway
administration, as demonstrated
by the experience of the various
state highway departments, are
as follows: The elimination of
politics as a factor in state high
way work; the control by tbe
state highway department of all
work on which state funds are
expended; adequate appropria
tions for continuous maintenance
of highways under efficient su
pervision from the day the high
ways are completed; state su
pervision as to surveys, plans
nnd specifications of roads and
bridges constructed under bond
issues and supervision of such
other road and bridge work as
requires considerable cash outlay
and the exercise of engineering
skill and knowledge.—Year Book,
United States Department of Ag
riculture.
BEAUTIFYING DIXIE HIGHWAY
Keeping Roads In Order.
Macadam, concrete and other strong
ly surfaced highways for the present
are primarily for the main roads, says
the Laporte Herald. The thousands ol
side roads, which are little traveled,
will have to get along without expen
sive pavements for many years.
But even these need not be in bad
shape or Impassable, as some of them
are in rainy weather.
The modem cheap machine or grad
er, when used in tlie spring, is n great
thing for roads and the tempers of
those who have to use them.
More than this, tbe road drag can be
used after each rain; the results arc
satisfactory wherever used. This, of
course, applies to earth or gravel roads.
A drag keeps them in tine shape
throughout the year.
What ails some of our dirt roads la
not that they are inherently bad, but
that nobody takes care of them. If
they are properly looked after with
drags they won't be the butt of so
mauy jokes.
Thousands of miles of them are go
ing to be with us for a great many
years; might as well see that thej' are
as good as drags can make them.
Even a macadam road doesn't
amount to much in a few years if it
isn't taken care of.
The Oiled Earth Road.
The oiled earth road has proved gen
erally satisfactory in Kansas, accord
ing to W. S. Gearhart, state engineer
of that state. In the construction of
such a road the earth from a strip in
the center of tlie roadway from six
teen to eighteen feet wide is thrown to
one side and the subgrade carefully
crowned and rolled. Oil at a tempera
ture of 250 degrees F. is then applied
at the rate of from one and one-quarter
to one and one-half gallons per square
yard, and enough earth to absorb the
oil (usually a layer about four inches
deep) Is graded back on to the road.
The roadway is then thoroughly sprin
kled and the earth, oil and water mix
ed by means of a disk harrow and a
drag. The roadway is then compacted
by a tamping roller, after which a sec
ond application of hot oil is made at
the rate of about one and one-half gal
lons per square yard. Another layer of
about four inches of fine earth is grad
ed on to the road and tbe mixing and
tamping repeated. On completion the
wearing surface is from five to six
inches thick.
