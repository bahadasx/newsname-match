CARRANZA REPLY
TO NOTE AWAITED
Tentative Plans Adopted to
Protect Border in Case
Hostilities Begin
Washington, D. C., June 21.—
8trong pressure is being brought
to boar upon Gen. Carranxa by
representatives of European pow
ers to prevent him from forcing a
break with the United States. In
direct reports reaching the state
department today told of these
efforts' and said there was a pos
sibility they would be successful.
Washington. D. C., June 21.—The
United States today anxiously await
ed word from Mexico City regarding
Gen. Carranza's attitude toward the
American note.
High officials here admitted pri
vately they look for war, although
avoiding any formal expressions Indi
cating forerunners of a declaration of
•war. The only answer required from
Carranza is action suppressing out
law treatment of Americana. The of
ficial text may already be In Carran
ra's hands.
The war department was getting
ready today to act on Gen. Funeton's
request for immediate dispatch of a
number of national guard units to the
border. Secretary Baker and Presi
dent Wilson probably will determine
what organisations should he sent
Several days may elapse before any
great
number of militia units can be
mastered Into the federal service.
In case Mexicans BttacTc the Ameri
can column a general rapid advance
probably would be ordered from the
border to a line perhaps 100 or more
miles sooth of the border. This line
then would be fortified and held until
volunteer reinforcements become
available. Thus, fighting would be
thrown into the enemy's territory and
the border protected against further
bandit attacks by thorough policing
of the country behind the main line.

Petrograd, June 21.—The Austrians,
their army cut in two, are in disorderly
retreat with the Russians pursuing
them toward the Carpathian moun
tains. The Russians have crossed the
river Sereth, southwest of Czernowitz
and have occupied three towns.
GERMANS REPUL8ED.
Paris, June 21.—A violent attack on
the French positions northwest of
Rheims was made by the Germans last
night at Hill 108 and In the direction of
Berry-au-Bac, according to an official
statement issued by the war office to
day. The attack was repulsed by the
French artillery fire.
The Germans exploded two mines be
fore launching their infantry/ against
the French trenches. Their repulse was
due, the statement says, to the effect
iveness of the French screen fire.
In the Verdun sector no infantry ac
tion was reported but a mutual bom

night
RUS8IAN8 REPUL8ED.
Berlin, June 21. —Russian forces

the German advances.
With the Austrian rear guard closely

Petrograd, June 21. —The war office
announced today that the number of
men oaptured by the Russians in the
offensive in Volhynla and Galicla up to
Thursday of last week was 172,484.
WAR SUMMARY.
Both the Russians and the Germans
claim successes for their arms be
tween the Pripet river and the Gall
clan frontier, though both official re
ports say fighting in that region has
been Bevere. I
In Gatlcla In the vicinity of Boo
zaoz, Austrlans and Germans are des
perately resisting Russian attempts to
advance on Lemberg.
While the weight of Gennan mili
tary power is being increasingly felt
on the eastern front where it has
stiffened the Austrian resistance to the
Russian drive, the pressure on the
French at Verdun has momentarily
lessened. There has been rather live
ly activity around the famous western
front fortress but no further moves by
the infantry are recorded in this af
ternoon's Paris bulletin.
The Germans have not been alto
gether idle on this front, however, for
after having touched off two mines
northwest of Rheims, a district in
which the deadlock of the armies has
been just about as complete as any
where along the line, they attacked
French
trenches on a height south of
Berry-au-Bac. Paris declares the de
fensive curtain of fire caused the as
sault to fail completely.

STATE'S WITNESS
ENDING OF PR08ECUTI0N DELAY
ED BY ARGUMENT OVER DE
FENDANT'S LETTERS.
Waukegan, 111., June 21. —Celeste
Youker, an Instructor in the DeKalb,
111., normal school, announced as the
state's final witness against Will H.
Orpet, charged with the murder of
Marion Lambert, was expected to fur
nish a link In the chain of circumstan
tial evidence State's Attorney Dady is
trying to forge around the former stu
dent when the tr^al was resumed to
day. It is believed she will testify that
she and Orpet were betrothed at the
time of Marion's death.
This engagement, If it existed, is
said to be regarded by the prosecution
as establishing a strong motive for the
crime alleged to have been committed
by the youth.
After Miss Youker*s testimony the
prosecution will rest Its case. Attor
neys for Orpet will ask the court to
take the case from the jury, failing in
which an adjournment for a day or so
is possible so the defense may marshal
Its witnesses.
The defense today objected to the
admission of the earlier letters as hav
ing no bearing on Marion's death.
Judge Donnelly, speaking to the law
yers before the jury was called In, said
that the letters were so prejudicial to
Orpet, as plainly Indicating seduction,
that it would be dangerous to submit
them to the Jury.
State's Attorney Dady argued for
their admission on the broad grounds
that an Illicit love affair culminating
in murder could be tfhown only by
reading the entire series of epistles.
Argument on this point and the ad
missibility of other evidence threaten
ed to make it Impossible for the pros
ecution to conclude Its evidence today.
Celestia Youker was held in the wit
ness room.

IMERIGINS HIDE
El Paso, Tex., June 21.—Five Ameri
cans are hiding in the mountains near
Parral in southern Chihuahua, fearing
to attempt to make their way to the
border, because of the feeling of the
natives, according to reports reaching
here today. The men, employes of the
Alvarado Mining and Milling Co., of
Parral, recently started toward El
Paso but were obliged to seek refuge
in the hill country. In the party are
T. G. Hakins, Jr., A. W. Morris, R. C.
Higley, H. A. Bulck and H. W. Collins.
Company officials here expressed no
great fear for their safety, asserting
that Mexican friends could be depend
ed upon to afford them protection.
With the exception of these five,
the exodus of Americans from Chihua
hua was practically complete today,
with the arrival of the eight remaining
members of the cokmy in Chihuahua
City. All of them told of food shortage
and of Increasing anti-American senti
ment.
EH Pasoans having heavy holdings
in Mexico were Interested in dis
patches from Mexico City which said
in substance that a decree had been
Issued by the de facto government
holding that any foreigner aoquiring

chase or contract, must renounce first
his allegiance to his .native country
and register himself as* a Mexican citi
zen. It further ordered that any per
son seeking to transfer his property to
a foreigner must obtain permission
from the proper authorities.
Border sentiment at times during
the day seemed taut, almost to the
snapping point, and at others lapsing
into a patient wait for news of Car
ranza's reception of the American
note. Persistent rumors were current
again in El Paso, that scouting patrols

mand had been attacked south of Nam

IRE DISCHARGED
Des Moines, June 21. —It appeared
today that several more days may

Iowa national guard at Camp Dodge,
near here, Is ordered by the adjutant
general. Reports reaching the guard
headquarters from all sections of the'
state were to the effect that virtually
every enlisted man is under arms add
is waiting for the mobilization call.
In the larger cities today regimental
surgeons were putting the enlisted
men through the required physical ex
amination. I{ was considered likely
that this process may further slightly
delay the mobilization. The men, it
was said, would have to undergo inves
tigation at the hands of the govern
ment surgeons before being mustered
in as volunteers and the guard doctors
were trying to expedite this process by
weeding out the manifestly unfit be
fore going Into camp. A score of men
were discharged from one local com
pany today. The majority were under
weight. Company commanders have
recruiting officers at work trying to re
place the discharged members with
men whose physical condition comes
up to the federal standard.
It was said at the adjutant general's
office today that orders for mobiliza
tion of the guard probably would not
be Issued until word had been received
from regimental commanders that
their units were recruited to minimum
peace strength and ready to take the
field.
