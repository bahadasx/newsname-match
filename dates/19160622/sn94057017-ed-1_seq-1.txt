orated with cut flowers. The
hostess, assisted by Mrs. Wil

most appetizing and refreshing
luncheon. Miss Crawford added
to our pleasure by giving us

Wm. Dunbar, whose ranch is

struck Mr. Dunbar just above
the left eye. In common with
many others we hope the injury
will prove less serious than is
now feared.

hole was down about 300 feet the stem
