Oflicial advices -reported that the

for withdrawal of General Pershing's

cabinet.
Special Agent Rogers, who made
the report, was unable io forecast the
action of the det'acto government, and
threw little light on'what was going
on in the Mexican capital. From oth­
er sources, it was learned, however,
that European diplomats are urging
pressure on Carrauza to, prevent him

San Antonio, Texas, June 21.—'Gen.
Pershing had been unable to get to
Gen. Funston late tonight any report
of the engagement at Carrizal, but
there appeared no reason to doubt the
report from Mexican sources that a
serious engagement had taken place,
and there was little doubt that the
Americans, a detachment of the Tenth
Cavalry, a negro organization, had
suffered heavily.
Instead of the tension being broken
by the clash, it was keyed still higher
tonight, and there appeared no proba­
bility that it would be lessened until
the oflicial report, from Gen. Pershing
was received, or unofficial news of un­
disputed aggression by the same Mex­
ican troops is received. Gen. Funston
said he would send no special orders
to Gen. Hell, commanding at El Paso,
or to Gen. Pershing until he had re­
ceived official news.
Claims Americans Responsible.

Gen. Gonzales, insisted that the Am­

fight by filing on the bearers of a
