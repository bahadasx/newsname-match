For Tomorrow
We have turned up the whole store to meet the
demands of men and young men who insist on get-
ting the most their money can buy.
We're looking for the fellow who is supercriti
cal, who knows goods clothes when he sees them
and refuses to purchase anything anywhere that
isn't guaranteed to satisfy him absolutely.
To carry out this program we offer clothing .
from a house with-a nation-wide reputation for
superiority. Superiority of styled fabric, tailoring,
fit and finish, second to none.
Kuppenheimer Clothes
$18 $20 $25
Fine Suits at $15
There are, we know, a host of men and young
men who do not care to spend more than $15 for
suits. To them we offer the finest suits at $15 ever
shown in Hood River. We do not claim them to be
$18 to $20 values. We don't sell them on bargain
basis. , . - . ' . '
We just ask
you to see 'em
with the
usual run of
clothes at this
price to con
vinceyourself that a "Fif
teen" is some
suit for the
money.

Event, Staging Ellison-White Attractions
To Begin June 5 at Citj Park's
Open Air Theatre
The next event of importance coming
Hood River way, leaving aside for a
moment the Glorious Fourth, which
111 really be the opening function of
Chautauqua week, is the annual Chau
tauqua, staging Ellison-White attrac
tions at the open air theatre in toe city
park, made famous by the local cnau
tauqua Association, which began its
activities in Woodwortb park, in the
Upper Valley and later transferring
them to the city. The Ellison-White
Chautauqua company is one of the fore
most in the eountry, and its concerts,
lectures and amusement programs are
high class.
The merit of the Ellison-White com
pany 'a program are well illustrated by
a story that was recently told by Henry
Serr. of the Hotel Oregon, formerly
proprietor of the Hotel Gail at Dallas.

The Ions drawn out season of berry
harvest, the maturity of the fruit hav
ing been delayed by cool weather, naa
made it necessary for the city council
to maintain longer than usual the spe
cial police service provided for the
protection of the Heights residence and
business sections. Allen Hart, special
policeman, has been retained by the
council, for an additional two weeks.
Acting on a petition of residents or
Columbia street, wno asked for the
installation of a two inch water main,
the council instructed the fire and
water committee to ascertain how
many of the petitioners would be will
ing to pay the cost of tapping the new
line.
The council accepted a report of the
fire and water committee to Klve bet
ter water aervice to the residents of
the Winans addition. A two inch main,
however, will be installed inatead of a
four inch pipe.

Because of the critical Mexican situ
ation and the ordera of mobilisation is
meeting no competition. The sale was
made because Robbins & Co. had confi
dence in Hood River and White Salmon
and because they knew that the salea
organizations practically controlled the
output of the two districts and would
thus eliminate irregular ana illegiti
mate competition. This deal shows
what can be done under cooperative
organization, and it insures Hood River
and White salmon proper vaiuea aa
long as organization is maintained.
Yet our deal ia surrounded oy
sued to the National Guard, a militant great deal of sensitive conditions. Cut
spirit haa pervaded Hood River and
much talk has been heard of the local
organization of a company of troops.
"On former occasions tne organiza
tion of a company of the National
Guard haa been proposed," says Geo.
R. Wilbur, "but nothing detinue -waa

throat competition cannot injure us
this year, but if the Dakota market is
broken this year, we may rest assured
that we will not get the cream of the
commission firm's business another
season."
Mr. Sieg states that the last asser
tion is made because of the fact that
during the past several days interests
hostile to the sales organizations and
the purchasers of the berries have been
offering affiliated growera rewards of
higher prices to break their contracts
with the aales organiaztion. Mr. Sieg,
while he will not name them, declares
that the offers are made by outaide
influences.
