; That . the? Pan-Pacific Hawaiian ex
hibit at the San Diego Exposition
would be much more effective if At
could be moved to the Hawaiian , VII
lage a concession at the fair, and
shown there is the opinion of Ernest
Kaal who returned to Honolulu on the
Matsonia last evening.' '. "
The Hawaiian Village at the Pan
Diego fair ia much more: interesting
than the - Hawaiian exhibit being
shown in the Pan-Pacific building.
said Mr: Kaal rtAt the exhibit there
is no music, "antf the exhibits are net
so thorough nor as Interesting as at the
Hawaiian Village. The only drawback
to the village is that it is a concession
and liquor .la ad there." V
. Mr. Kail said attendance at the Han
Diego exposition is small, hardly more
than oOO persons a day. . He aald the
Hawaiian Village has a remarkably
fine reproduction of Diamond Head.
Mr. Kaai has ben ill, and is recuper
