The Mexican Situation.
As we go to press, the feeling
between this country and Mexteo
JS very tense. No one can tell
what a day or even an hour may
pring. Carranza has told the U,
S. that they must move out.
fifilson has told the " First
!hief" he will not and that any
r ttack on American troops means
war. The Mexicans are fever
ishly at work preparing for war
and little less can be said of this
country. The entire state militia
has been ordered to be in readi
ness for federal service, and
about 100,000 of this force is
ordered to mobilize at their
VBeveral stations and make ready
for service on the border as
needed. General Funston has
i this force be forwarded to
he border. Recruiting is every
where in 1 progress. It is ex-
ipected that the whole number
iXalled for will be under arms
Iwithin ten days and that many
M these troops will be on the
jborder within that time. Just
now a quiet prevails throughout
the tcoubUd zone. This may
mean "a calm before the storm,"
or that the powers thatr be in
-at troubled land are cominc to
J their senses. It is to be hoped
Ithat this may be the case and
if hat war may b averted.
I i Later There can now be no
jdoubt about war with Mexico.
k fight has occurred in which-40
Americans were killed and 17
taken prisioners. Many., Mexi
!ans were killed, among them a
general.

jme Essentials in Handling
v Cream.
Have you provided a conveni
it system of heating a suffici
ent supply of water for use in
gashing the 'milk , utensils?
""e you provided a way for
ling the ceam aid keeping it
pool till it is sent to the cream
ery? Both the above are very
. .i--t J--i. j i u i
( mporiani, laccura uuu snuuiu not
be carelessly neglected by any
dreamery patron.
I Milk or . cream handled or
stored in poorly, washed and
insanitary vessels will soon sour
develop bad flavors, and will L
-"-ch the creamery In such poor
condition that it is impossible
for it to'be made into first class
butter. The dairyman who sells
this kind of cream is imposing a
heavy tax on himself, as well as
the good dairyman who handles
his cream properly by forcing
the creamery to pay a lower
price for his fat. Every dairy
man should provide himself with
milk pails and cans which are
used for no other purpose than1
for handling milk. When
through separating the cream all
utensils used in handling the
mute should be washed in warm
water, then in hot, water, using
some , good clensing powder
which does not contain any
grease, then rinse them in water
which is near boiling hot, and
place them in the sun under
screen from flies.- The separat
or should be taken apart and all
parts s which come in contact
with the milk washed as above
after each separation.
The best way to supply this
hot water is bythe use of a
small boiler. When this cannot
be had - a cheap water heating
device may be built on the farm
by taking a few brick or stone
and building a small furnace un
der a shed beside the milk house,
Make the grates of a coil of one
inch water piping. . This can be
done by cutting the piping in
short pieces and Uniting these
peices with elbows. The pipe
should run to and fro thru the
furnace four or six times and
the two ends v run through the
wall of the wash room neaf' the
wash sink and into the side of a
barrel (an ordinary mojassesj
barrel) filled with clean water.
When the fire is started in the
furnace the heating of the water
in the pipe will cause the water
to circulate and soon the .whole
barrel of water will be hot. A
faucet should be placed near the
bottom of the barrel just over
the sink for drawing out the hot
water.
A good sink can be made by
building a water tight box ' 2ft.
wide, 4ft. long, and 16 in. deep,
of 2in. boards, -or by building a
frame of above dimensions, lin
ing it with tongue and groved
flooring, then with galvanized
iron. Put a faucet near the bot
tom for drawing off the wash
water.
The cream should be cooled as
low as possible immediately after
being separated, and stored in a
cool place. A dug well or a box
thru which water is pumped
from the well three or four
times daily makes a good place
for storing the cream. Do not
try to, keep the cream longer
than two days in warm weather.

"At a meeting of the Mississippi Bar Association at Laurel last
week Chickasaw county popular lawyer and progressive farmer
was elected President over a
ballot, with Mr. Stovall leading, the other lawyer nominated for
office asked that Mr. StovalPs election be unanimous.
"As President Stovall is a member of the American Bar Associa
tion, a committeeman on uniform legislation, a member of the
commercial law committee and a commissioner from the state on
Uniform State Legislation, and also a very influential business
man, it is a pleasure to hia friends to see him; chosen to this
honorable position which he so well deserves and which he will fill
wisely and efficiently. - '
"Mr. Stovall is about 45 years of age and was born"between
Okolona and Houston, on the large farm of his father, the late W.
G. Stovall, for many years the popular sheriff of Chickasaw
eounty. He was educated in the Okolona public Schools, Highland
Falls College, New York, and the University of Mississippi. Since
graduating jn the U. of M. law class, Mr. Stovall has done a
general practice in his home town, Okolona, and is now counsel for
the Okolona branch of the Southern Railway and assistant district
counsel for the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. "
"Energetic and enthusiastic for the upbuilding of our country,
Mr. Stovall is President of the Chickasaw County'Sunday School
Convention, Superintendent" of the Okolona Baptist Sunday School,
Chairman of the'Hoard of Trustees of the Okolona Public School
and President of the Board of Trustees of the Okolona Industrial
School. For a number of years he was Captain of one of tfie
largest and best military companies in the state National Guard.
He has-never held a political office, nor has he ever been a candi
date for any office before the voters of this county or state. On
his model farms are grown the
pleasure (to visit his wronderful

fore he is a man's man." Commercial Appeal. y
Mr. Stovall has a wife who,
accomplshed musicians in the state, and three children, all boys;
two of whom attend the University, and the third one the High
School at Okolona.. He is truly a patriot, believing his country the
model in fundamental government for the world and his people the
best on earth. No office he ever
because he enjoys it; indeed, he is a real glutton for work. He
enjoys play at playtime, but the hard student he is, crops out in
his cases where his powers of reasoning and speech batter down
all illegal walls and set safe upon the rock of his logic both judge
and jurors. " ,
; Though keenly appreciative, no man in , the county is more
modest. It is hard to get him under the. "lime light." Just after
presiding over the annual meeting of the Board of Trustees of the
Okolona (Miss.) Industrial School, sometime ago in Boston, he was
literally beseiged for a photo and statement, but he had "nothing
to state" aqd would not pose for the photographer, so the reporters
had (o make tip their story.

11 TRAGIC JOKE
"Many Gods Worshipped, But None
in Truth Spirits Must Deliver
the Goods.
Korea may well he classed with
Athena as a land with many gotta,
write J T. Nw!uri(l, a Presbyterian
niissiioriiii y. And I hey like the old Ath
enians Ifinoranily worship the un
known Rod, for they have a dim know
ledge of a Biiprcino being who created
all things, who given the rains and tlio
harvests. But like the deitils, thev
claim he made all things and then
gave over !he running of affairs to vu
"rloiiH spirits, who must be worship
ped and placated. Imperially is this
trua of t he intiiign spirits who are con
stantly interfering with and opposing
the work of good spirits. The Korein
argues that the good ones will help
nyway, because they are good, aici
(hat. il is necessary only lo bribe tlio

their worship consists in I ho main of

As a matter of facl the" Korean has
no deep rocled religion of any soil,
but is us changeable as Ihe sinfjiee
of the sea. If a man worship; honnalh,

with blessings and then the tree is de
serted and Ihe rock is a popular idol
for a season. The worshippers wi'l
not be put off with promise.', but to
speak in the vernacular, the spirti
must deliver the goods in order to be
popular. So It Is not uncommon for
a man to go the rounds of ancestor
worship, emperor worship, mountain
.pirits, tree spirits, the elements, dev
il posts and nuddism to make sure t
his. blessing. In fact, I do not believe
you can put your finger on any one
religion, any say that is peculiar to Ko
rea. The people mix them all up and
give them all a chance. They are poly
thelsts with a vengance.
The truth Is the Korean Is of such
a happy-go-lucky disposition - that bo
does no worshipping of any sort ex
cept on stated occasions or in times
of need or danger. One man putg out
t. dish of rice for the mountain spirit
and the next hungry msn that comes
along eats it up. They put small
pieces of money in straw manikins
and these are put out along fields or
n front of the houses as a gift to th
.spirits, but when their backs are turn
ed the proverbial small boy slips up
and steals the gift.
Their religion Is such a mixture and
held with so little regard that it would
be a huge joke if it were not so pltifu
-nd did not have to do with immortal
souls. It has been this disregard for
nil forms of heathenism that has maie
it so easy tosupplant these lightly
held beliefs with the gospel, which sat
isfies the longing that has driven the
Korean from one temple to another
and from one Idol to another for so
many yearn.

Mississippi Man
Gained 30 Pounds
on Four Bottles
Well Known Produce Man Says
He Had Rheumatism So Bad
His Muscles Felt Like They
Were Tied in Knot
"Yes, sir; it is a fact when I tell
you that I have gained thirty
pounds on Tanlac, and am now
able to do about twice the amount
of work I have ever been able to .
do at .any time during the past
ten years," said Mr. C. B. Gwin,
the well known produce man, of
Amory, Miss., in telling" of the
wonderful results he had obtained
from Tanlac, a few days ago.
"J have been in a general run
down condition for some time,"
continued Mr. Gwin, and suffered
principally with rheumatism. My
whole system seen ed run:down,'
debilitated, I could not sleep at
night and I would, feel in the
morning just as fatigued as I did
upon going to bed at night.' My
digestion became affected and I
couldn't eat. Attacks of violent
headaches were frequent, and
my nervous system seemed to be
all disordered. The rheumatism
was so severe at times my
muscles seemed as if they were
tied up in a knot. I lost a good
deal in weight and it looked like
I was getting weaker and weaker
every day.
"I was persuaded to try Tan
lac and I got a bottle- of the
medicine. It is certainly making
a new' man of me. I can now
eat and sleep better than I have
in years. My rheumatism has
all gone and I feel strong and
built up in every way. I am a
well man and certainly am tfiank-.
ful that I found out about this
wonderful medicine. As I have
already said, I have gained thirty
pounds in six week's time, and I
feel stronger and better than I
have in years. Tanlac has cer
tainly straightened me out, and
I believe it will do the same
thing for anyone else who has
the same trouble I had."
, Commenting on the above state
ment, Mr. G. F. Willis, Southern
Distributor of Tanlac, said:
"Rheumatism is not only 6ne '
of the most prevalent, but one of
the most painful and difficult to
treat of all present day diseases.
When the digestive organs and
bowels are not working properly
and the kidneys become clogged
up the whole system becomes
deranged and saturated with
uric acid jpoisons and other im-'
purities,' which accumulate in the "
joints, and produce the condition
known as rheumatism." -
"Tanlac isa powerful recon
structive tonic, and quickly over
comes this condition by acting
directly on the vital organs, toning-
them up and enabling them
to perform their proper func
tions, so that the impurities are
soon eliminated from the system,
in a natural way. Liniments and
external applications as a general
rule only afford temporary relief. -Tanlac
is a constitutional treat
ment, and gets right at the, root
of the. trouble by removing the
cause."

clusively by W. E. BEARDEN,
and in '.Houlka exclusively by J.
