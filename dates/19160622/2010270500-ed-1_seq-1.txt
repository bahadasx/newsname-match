rounds three sides of the house.

Shuman, who will visit the camp
daily. The Crystal lake camp,
which is an annual event of the mis
sion, is made possible by the .gener
osity of Sioux City business men,
who raised a fund to send the boys
of needy families to tho lake . . . .Ac
tual digging on tho diiinage ditch
near Jackson, Neb., which has been
in litigation for several years, was
started early last week. For tho
past four years an injunction against
the improvement has prevented the
supervisors of drainage district No.
2 from proceeding with the work.
A suit is now being prepared by the
supervisors against the original sign
ers of the- injunction, who were forc
ed to give bonds to the amount of
about $10,000. The supervisors, in
their petition, will seek damages and
costs from those who have caused
the delay in the work, it was stated
last night by Dr. C. H. Maxwell, of
Dakota City, one of the supervisors.
While the amount that will be asked
for in the suit has not been given
out, it probably will be in the neigh
borhood of $15,000 to $20,000. The
the injunction preventing the dig
ging of the ditch was issued in 1910.
The case was carried to the district
court of Dakota county, the supreme
court of Nebraska and the supreme
court of the United States. The
case was heard by the latter court
last November and an opinion dis
solvingtho injunction was written
by former Justice Charles E.
Hughes, now republican nominee
for president. Contractors were re
luctant to start work on the ditch
because of the tedious legal proceed
ings which have been connected
with its construction, but recently
authorization to start was given by
the supervisors of the district in
which the Jackson ditch is located.
The ditch in question will be a little
more than two miles in length, antl
when constructed, according to the
supervisors, will prevent the inun
dation of about 7,000 acres of low
land. The outlet will run from near
Jackson to a lake or cutoff of the
Missouri river. It is asserted that
the ditch will catch a vast amount
of water which flows from a series
of hills near Jacdson. The cut will
start at the base of the hills and run
to the lake. The first work was
done at the Jackson end last week.
Boy Scout Camp
The Boy Scouts returned from
camp last Saturday after spending
two enjoyable weeks at Crystal lake.
Fifteen boys and two officials spent
all or part of the time there; The
weather might have been better but
it takes pretty bad weather to scare
a bunch of Scouts. They are a dan
dy bunch of fellows too. I never
wish to camp with better. We had
all the talents, from a thick set
Dutchman who gave Charley Chap
lin shows to a tall, fair-haired, bash
ful fellow who" can do anything from
holding down Newcastle at a field
meet to holding down cake at supper
time. Our Patrol Leader nearly res
cued a young lady from a watery
grave, but she refused to get out,
and he was too bashful to dive in
and make her.
We had heaps of food and deeply
regret that our capacity was not
large enough to hold all that was
sent down. We especially wish to
thank Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Krumwie
de, Mrs. Leech, Mrs. Frederick,
Mrs. Kinkle Mrs. Graham, Mrs.
Stinson, Mrs. Aucock, Mrs. Ansnes,
Mrs. Antrim, Lottie Hileman, Aileen
Stinson. Mr. Neiswanger, Mr. Han
son, Mrs. Seymour, and Mrs. Mor
rison. If 1 have missed anybody I
apologize now.
We had a field meet all to our
Belves. Result: Class A, 1 John
son, 2 Kinkle, 3 Ansnes. Class B, 1
Johnson, 2 Hanson, 3 Seymour.
Stinson ran second in class B but
was disqualified by the Court of Hon
or for neglecting camp.
'We feel very grateful to Mr.
Krumwiede for the use of his cot
tage and boat, to Mr. Frederick for
use of his team and Ford, to Mrs.
Stinson for use of cooking utensils
and benches.
We are very sorry that camp is
over and look forward to an even
bigger and better one next year.

County Agent's Field Notes.
IY A. H. HECKHOKK.
Several weeks ago it was announc
cdthat I would be away from the
office. This was an error at that
time, and instead 1 will be away from
the office the present week for a
few days.
Meanwhile, there have come to
my attention several cases of hog
cholera. Just nt this time it is most
important that we nip these out
breaks in the bud, and thus prevent
any serious sprcau oi the disease m
any locality.
My position here is to assist in
whatever way I can. and I would
urgently request that when any
swine show off in condition you let
me know, and while you may find it
more expedient to have some one
else handle a situation like this, your
letting me know will put me in touch
with it and probably be of service to
some one else.
Among smaller swine, especially
weanlings, there is a disease which
very clo'y resembles cholera in
sympt- a, but which differential
diagnos. will reveal to be necrotic
enteritis. There is quito a bit of
this prevalent here, and we can only
recommend careful feebing, isola
tion of the sick ones, and more sani
tary surroundings.
A few people have reported cases
of hoof and mouth disease in cattle,
but which in all cases has proven to
be necrotic stomatitis. The sores
are similar to hoof and mouth dis
ease but are caused by another germ
or uaciins. its appearance might be
expected and need not cause alarm.
M. E. Church Notes.
The people who stayed at home
' at Sunduy morning on account of
rain missed a very interesting ser
vice. Before the sermon the pastor
called upon the True Blues to unveil
and present the new pulpit. After
the gift had been accepted the pas
tor dedicated it to the preaching of
"tho glorious gospel of our Lord
and Savior, Jesus Christ." The gift
is greatly appreciated by the church,
and we rejoice to see the spirit ani
mating the young people.
On Saturday next at 8 p. m., the
fourth quarterly conference will be
held. This is the most important of
the year as many vital matters come
lip lor our consideration. Let every
member' please be present.
Dr. E. E. Hosman, the district su
perintendent, will preach on next
Sunday at 11 a. m., and the pastor
at 8 p. m.
Will every member please return
the benevolance cards before Satur
day if possible so that a report may
be made to the quarterly conference.
Remember our aim is "All financial
obligations to be met in full."

COUNTY SCHOOL NOTES
WILFRED n. VOSS, SUPT,
Two Dakota county pig club boys,
Victor Hansen and Lawrence Ras
muBsen, spent last week in Lincoln
attending tho State Junior Short
Course held at tho University Farm.
Tito boys had a fine time, part of
each day boing spent in receiving in
struction in crops, live stock, and
carpentry. Interesting and educa
tional excursions wero taken each
afternoon and the evenings were
spent in playing games or swimming
under the direction of Y. M. C. A.
specialists.
Theso boys had their railroad fare
and all expenses paid by the Sioux
City Stock Yards company as a re
ward for their good work in raising
pigs last year. Tho same company
is offering to pay tho expenses next
year of two boys from Dakota coun
ty who make the best records in pig
club work.
The boys who made the trip think
that the award is worth working
for.
SIOUX CITY ROUNDUP
TO AFFORD THRILLS
Coming Celebration On July 3, 4, 5
and 6 Will Partake of Blood Let
ting Character.
Sioux City, la., June 1C (Spe
cial.) The Mr. Cowboy who wins
the world championship and the long
end of the $2,000 purse hung up for
riders in the Sioux City Roundup
July 3 to G inclusive, will know after
the contest that he has been doing a
"tolerable lot of ridin."
Joe Morton, manager of the big In
dependence day show, has just fram
ed six seperate contracts with parties
in Texas, Wyoming, Montana and
South Dakota for a string of outlaw
and wild horses, which, the owners
claim, have never been ridden.
It's to be seasick time" for Mr.
Cowboy and also for Miss Cowgirl,
who also is to battle in Sioux City
for championship honors. Incidental
ly tho big crowds are to see tho old
west revived at the Interstat Fair
grounds in the most interestitt, bories
of frontier day Bportingevt never
produced in this section of the .niddle
west.
Cowboys will make night shirt
ride3, battle through potato games,
do the Roman standing race of the
prairies and even run the chuck
wagon contest off in spirited Btylo
for tho Roundup guests. Bulldog
ing of 'steers, roping games, trick
and fancy riding events are on tho
bill, which calls for eighteen sepa
rate contests for each day of the
show.
The reunion is being hailed as
probably the last great assemblage
of cowboys and cowgirls in this sec
tion of the middle west.
The Mid-West bank of Sioux City,
like Silas Wegg of old, lapses into
poetry, and a sign in its window
says:
May many come
GOOD banking find. .
Keep the Mid-West
Always in mind.
