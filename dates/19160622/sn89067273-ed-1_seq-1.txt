WOODCRAFT STORIES
FOR LITTLE CHILDREN
Twelfth Story.
By L. Roy Ferris.
You know, when it rains and rains and just keeps
on raining a fellow can only look out of the window
and watch, the raindrops, chase, each other down the
window pane on their way to the little branch back of
the house that runs through the woods pasture on its
way to the sea. It gets on a fellow's nerves just to stay
in the house when he could be having so much fun
sawing wood and doing chores like all boys love to do.
This is just the way Brother Coon felt about being
pinned up in the house, only he doesn't havu any window
pane for the raindrops to run down, but he has the
window all right, that Brother Woodpecker made.
Bunny Red Squirrel living just across the way from
Brother Coon saw him stick his sharp nose out of his
window and make the ugliest face because it was rain
ing. He wanted to go down and look for crawfish,
but who wants to go out in a storm even if they have
a good overcoat?
By and by the sun came out and Brother Coon was
a different fellow. He smiled at Brother Red Squirrel
and actually offered to help him gather some hickory
nuts, but it was early spring and hickory nuts. were
not ripe. I am sure Brother Coon never thought of that.
About this time something happened that made him
smile sure enough. Blue Jay came flying along and
said that the Oriole said that Gentle Dove said that
Red Breast said that the Camp Boy was coming back to
the woods. Red Breast knew, for he had just returned
with his wife and four babies. The babies looked larger
than the Mother.
Besides, when the birds tell anything it is always
the truth; don't they always tell each other where the
bad boy lives who shoots the gum sling? Who ever
heard of any bird building its nest near the porch of
a .boy that will kill a bird?
Oh, joy, Robin was right; Brother Coon's sharp ears
heard the shish, shish of a paddle and heard a familiar
voice say, "1 wonder how Brother Coon and all my little
friends are by this time?"
Mother Soft Shell and her four little softshells did
not fall off the log into the creek as the canoe passed.
Fatty Bear sat on a log and dangled his feet into the
water as he grinned at the boy in passing, hadn't the boy
helped him out of a bad scrape when he was going over
to Neighbor Brown's just to borrow something to eat
out of the hen house and had been caught between
the rails?
Straight to the old campside sped the canoe. The
nose of the canoe touched the white sand in front of the
uld camp site where Mother Turtle has her nest in which
are twenty-six white round eggs that look like white
marbles, with shells that are not hard and are not soft,
but are just ''kinder sorter".
"Hellow, old fellow," said the Camp Boy to the Coon
after he had landed and had removed his things. "Look
whom I have brought with me". Brother Coon, busy
poking into the many mysterious packages, saw his
curly-haired pal of four who was the Camp boy's brother.
Many was the tumble they had had together while at
the Camp Boy's house; and many is the lump of sugar
his little pal had helped him steal from the sugar bowl.
But of course we mustn't tell anybody about that.
Where is the pretty Butcher Bird that sticks the wig
gling mouse onto a thorn if he has one left over from
dinner. Where is the little Brown Wren that always lays
three more eggs so the three little fellows that are already
hatched can do the hatching for their mother, which
gives the Mother more time to visit and gossip. Bunny
Rabbit, ah, there he is."
Bunny stuck his head from a bunch of grass and
twisted his ears and wiggled his whiskers as much as to
say, J'Well, can I believe my eyes, if there isn't the Camp
Boy again."
It was not long before the delicious odor of bacon
was in the breeze, and a rustling in the leaves near by
caused Bunny Rabbit to say as he prepared to run, "I
wonder what that is?"
Sifter Possum remarked, "I guess you ought to know,
when the bacon smells so good".
Sure enough there was old Brother Black Snake.
