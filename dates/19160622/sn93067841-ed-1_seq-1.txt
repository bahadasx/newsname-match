NATIONAL GUARD
GALLED OUT
FOR SERVICE ON THE MEXICAN
BORDER-DEMAND ON ALL THE
STATES AND THE DISTRICT.
Washington, June 18:?Virtually
the entire mobile strength of the
National Guard of all the States and
the District of Columbia was ordered
mustered into the Federal service
tonight by President Wilson.
About 100,000 men are expected to
respond to the call. They will be
mobilized immediately for such ser
vice on the Mexican border as may
later be assigned to them.
Gen Funston, commanding the
border forces, will designate the
time and place for movements of
guardsmen to the international line
as the occasion shall require.
In announcing the orders Secretary
Baker said the State forces
would be employed only to guard
the border and that no additional
troop movements into Mexico were
contemplated except in pursuit of
raiders.
Simultaneously with the National
Guard call Secretary Daniels, of the
navy department, ordered additional
war vessels to Mexican waters on
both coasts to safeguard American
lives.
At the war, navy and State departments
it was stated that no new
advices as to the situation in Mexico
had come to precipitate the new orders.
With the last two weeks, however,
tension has been increasing steadily.
The crisis presented by Gen Carranza's
note demanding the recall of
Gen Pershing's expedition force has
been followed by a virtual ultimatum
served on the American officer
by Gen Trevino, the Mexican commander
in Chihuahua. To this was
added yesterday the possibility that
American and Mexican troops had
clashed across the border from San
Benito, Texas.
Administration officials made no
attempt to conceal their relief over
the safe return of Major Anderson's
cavalry squadron to Brownsville after
their successful bandit chase.
The troopers crossed in pursuit of
bandits in the face of intimations that
they would be attacked if they did
so. Gen Funston himself reported
that he anticipated fighting, presumably
with Carranza troops.
IN EVENT OF WAR.
Mobilization of the National
Guardsmen to support Gen Funston's
line will pave the way for releasing
some 30,000 regulars for immediate
service in Mexico in the
event of open hostilities with the
Carranza Government. The Guardsmen
themselves could not be used
beyondjthe line without authority
of Congress, and until they had
volunteered for that duty as they
are called out under the militia law.
The new law, which would make
them available for any duty under
the Federal Government, goes into
effect July 1.
The entire mobile regular army va
the United States, several provisional
regiments of coast artillery, serving
as infantry, and the National
Guard of Texas, New Mexico and
Arizona now are on the border or
in Mexico. Definite figures have
never been made public, but it is
understood that Gen Funston has
about 40,000 regulars and probably
5,000 more Guardsmen, of whom
10,000 regulars are with Gen Pershing
or scattered aiong his line of
communications from Namiquipa,
Mex, to Columbus, N M.
TELEGRAMS TO GOVERNORS.
Telegrams calling for the militia
were 9ent tonight to the Governors
of all States except the three whose
Guardsmen already have been mustered
in, after an all-day conference
at the war department, attandeded
J by Secretary Baker, Major Gen
j Scott, the chief of staff; Major Gen
Bliss, chief of the mobile army, and
Brig Gen Mills, chief of the militia
division general staff. Brig Gen
McCombs, president of the Army
War College, also was consulted.
Since Mr Baker did not find it necessary
to confer again with President
Wilson after his visit to the
White House last night, it was apparent
the decision to bring out the
militia was reached then.
Secretary Baker issued the following
statement:
"In view of the disturbed condi
tions on the Mexican border and in
order to assure complete protection
for all Americans, the President has
called out substantially all the State
militia and will send them to the
border wherever and as fully as Gen
Funston determines them to be needed
for the purpose stated.
"If all are not needed an effort
will be made to relieve those on duty
there from time to time so as to
distribute the duty.
"This call for militia is wholly unrelated
to Gen Pershing's expedition
and contemplates no additional
entry into Mexico, except as may be
necessary to pursue bandits who attempt
outrages on American soil.
"The militia are being called out
so as to leave some troops in the
several States. They will be mobilized
at their home stations, where
necessary recruiting can be done."
Secretary Daniels tonight ordered
several additional gunboats and
other small craft on both the east
and west coasts to Mexican waters.
Mr Daniels described the movement
of ships as "precautionary."
He directed Rear Admiral Winslow,
commander 01 the west coast division,
to make a selection of several
available vessels and dispatch them
to. join other vessels at ports which
he is now watching:.

WHY WILSON SHOULD
BE RE-ELECTED.
ELOQUENT NOMINATION SPEECH
OF JUDGE JOHN W. WESTCOTT
OF NEW JERSEY.
At St Louis last Thursday night
John W Westcott, Attorney-General
of New Jersey, who nominated President
Wilson in the Baltimore convention
of 1912, placed in nomination
the name of Woodrow Wilson
f o a fUn T r\f fka HomA/irO fin

party for the next four years.
Judge Westcott reviewed in eloquent
terms the work of the Administration.
and closed with these stirring
phrases: "Therefore, my fellow
countrymen, not I, but his deeds
and achievementa; not I, but the
spirit and purposes of America; not
I, but the prayers of just men; not
I,but civilization itself; nominates to
succeed himself to the Presidency of
the United States, to the Presidency
of a hundred million free people,
bound in impregnable union, the
scholar, the statesman, the financier,
the emancipator, the pacificator, the
moral leader of Democracy, Woodrow
Wilson."
Second only to Judge Westcott
was the tribute of William Jenning3
Bryan, invited to the platform by a
two-thirds vote, as Chairman James
ruled. The speaker paid the most
glowing tributes to the President
and his policies, the deeds of his
Administration and the prestige and
diplomatic victories it has won, and
brought forth tremendous and repeated
applause by declaring that
the forthcoming four years will
show even greater accomplishments
for America led by the present occupant
of the White House.
The approach of the night session
found an immense crowd besieging
the doors of the Coliseum. Thousands
packed the streets and drove
solidly against the police guards.
Following is the text of the platform:
The Democratic party, in national
convention assembled, adopts the
following declaration to the end that
the people of the United States
may both realize the achievements
wrought by four years cf Democratic
administration and be appraised
of the policies to which the party
is committed for the further conduct
of national affairs:

"ABSOLUTELY SAFE"
lullttiMd by Fedoroi Rosorw Board to Ad i
Woodrow Wilson. It is the best exposition
of sound Democratic policy
at home and abroad.
"'We challenge comparison 01 our
record, our keeping of pledges, and
our constructive legislation, with
those of any party of any time.
"We found our country hampered
by special privileges, a vicious
tariff, obsolete bank laws, and an inelastic
currency. The Republican
party, despite repeated pledges, was
impotent to correct abuses which it
had fostered. Under our administration,
under a leadership which
has never faltered, these abuses have
been corrected, and our people have
been freed therefrom.
"Our archaic banking and currency
system, prolific of panic and disaster
under Republican rule, long
the refuge of the money trust, has
been supplanted by the federal reserve
act, a true Democracy of
credit under Government control,
already proved a financial bulwark
in a world, mobilizing our resources,
placing abundant credit at
the disposal of legitimate industry,
and making a currency panic impossible.
"We have created a federal trade
commission to accommodate the perplexing
questions arising under the
anti-trust laws so that monopoly
may be strangled at its birth and
legitimate industry encouraged. Fair
competition in business is now assured.
?
"We have effected an adjustment
of the tariff, fair to the consumer
and to the producer. We have adjusted
the burdens of taxation so
that swollen incomes bear their
equitable share."
The platform asserts that the
Democratic party has lifted human
labor from the category of commodities.
has secured to the working
man the right of voluntary association
for his welfare. It also
says that the party has enlarged the
postal saving system, improved the
postal service in every branch and
placed the postoffice on a self-supporting
basis for the first time in
the country's history.
It is declared that reforms needed
to clear away privilege and prevent
unfair discrimination have been effected
by recent legislation and that,
as far as possible, the party must
remove every remaining element of
unrest and uncertainty from the
path of the business men of America.
