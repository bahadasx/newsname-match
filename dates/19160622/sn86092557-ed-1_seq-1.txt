CAPTAlNJfOREY IN COMMAND.
Columbus, N. M., June 22.?Captain Lewis S. Morey of the Tenth

soldiers which engaged the Mexicans at Carrizal yesterday.
THE MEXICAN REPORT.
WASHINGTON, June 22.?An official communication from the
Mexican foreign office announcing the clash betwen Mexican and American
troops at Carrizal and saying the de facto government to understand why the
Americans should have been so far away from their base, was delivered to
Secretary Lansing today by Elesio Amedondo, the Mexican ambassador
deignate.
The communication telegraphed by General Aguilar Carranza, foreign
minister, follows:
"Please bring to the attention of the Department of State that an en
gagement occurred today (21st) at Carrizal near Villa-Ahuanada, Chihua
hua, between American forces numbering about 200 men with a force of our
government troops, during which engagement General Felix Gomez and sev
eral of our troops were killed. There were several - casualities among the
American rtoops taken prisoners."
"According to the statement made by interpreters who were acting as
guides for the American, forces the commander of the latter is responsible
for the encounter.
Please make proper representations to the department, and say to the
Secretary of State that this government finds it difficult to understand why
the American troops that took part in the engagement should have been at
Carrizal, a point on the line of the Mexican Central railroad some distance
from Ciudad Jaurez, and rather far from the point which is alleged to be the
base of the rest of the American troops which entered Mexico by Colum
bus.
"Further details will follow."

was fired upon by the American troops
after he had delivered his message.
The American troops immediately

OFFICIAL REPORTS
Battle Has Not Changed
President Wilson's Mex
ican Policy.
WASHINGTON, June 22.?While
the Government bad no official confir
mation early today of Mexican reports
that American and Mexican troops
were in a battle yesterday with heavy
losses on the American Bide there was
a stir of grim purpose about the war j
and state departments.
Sec. Baker conferred with Pres
ident Wilson on the basis of roports
given out by Mexican commanders at |
the border and transmitted to the
State department. Later Secretary |
Lansing was closeted with the War
secretary and afterwards Mr. Baker I
hastened to the capltol for confer
ences with the Congressional military
committee chairman.
No explanation for these conferen-!
ces were given. It.was learned, how
ever, that telegraph wires were noi1
with inquiry sent to various governors
seeking reports of r the number of Na
tional guard regiments mobilized avail
able for Immediate service.
Officials said President Wilson
would await a definite report of what
has happened from General Pershing.
It was not expected until late today,
as the town of Carrizal where the
fighting was said to have occurred is
60 miles or more from General Per*!
shlng's advanced base at Namiqulpa.
At tho White House it was Bald the
President's policy was unchanged for
the present at least and that Mr. Wil-I
son has no Intention of going before
Congresa immediately.
It would take a courier or survivors
of the American detachment many J
hours to make their way to General
Pershing's base. No clear view of
what happened could be had from
Mexican statements transmitted from
the border. ^
The stories of the fight conflict but
seem to indicate that the Americans
were trapped or ambushed and suffer
ed their chief losses from machine
gun fire.
It is presumed General Pershing
promptly dispatched reinforcements
including artillery to aid the cavalry
detachment if It was still engaged
with the Mexicans or Its lines c2 re
tirement menaced. No reports have
come from General Funston, however,
indicating that be had knowledge of
additional troops movements or was
preparing to send more men to Per
shing.
Secretary Baker said no marching
orders had gone to National Gtiard
units. Nothing could be done he de
clared until a report;from American
sources bad been received.

NOW EQUIPPED

Complete Bacteriological
Laboratory Installed at
Cook Hospital.
MEDICAL ASSO. DID II
Milk, Water, Blood and Oth
er Tests Made Right
at Home.
Public spirited members of the Ma
rlon County Medical association re
alizing the need in this community for
a bacteriological laboratory wherein
typhoid, diphtheria and other clangor
ous diseases may be traced to then
souco and their spread prevented,
have quietly and without asking any
one for help gone about providing such
.a laboratory.
As a result of their activities there
was installed in Cook Hospital this
week a complete bacteriological lab
oratory'- The cost of the equipment is
nearly $1,000 and it Includes all man
|iier of apparatus with a refrigerator,
, wter lizers,. microscope, delicate anal
ytical balance, various kinds of culture
nudla and reagents. Most any kind
of work may be done In this labora
tory from the simple analysis of milk
or water to the Wldal examination for
typhiod or Wasserman reaction for the
detection of-specific infection. Diph
theria swabs may be examined or
blood counts made. Already this week
reports have been made on swabs of
suspected diphtheria cases and any
phjfeiclan In the county may have work
done by leaving it at the hospital.
Other improvements recently in the
Cook hospital are the complete reno
vation of practically all of the rooms
and wards.. These have been re-paint
ed and cleaned thoroughly. In addi
tion to the bacteriological laboratory
it is now planned to provide a com
plete X-Ray equipment for the Hos
pital. This will likely cost several
thousand dollars, but according to the
physicians la badly needed. -.
The physicians in charge of the lab
oratory at the hospital will likely of
fer the use of It to the city for the
purpose of milk and water inspection.
While no official offer has as yet been
made it is the intention to confer the
city officials and is thought that some
arrangements may be made whereby
the city scientists can do their work
in this laboratory.
The addition pf a Babcock machine
for determining the amount of butter
fat in'milk would be all that is nec
essary to provide the now laboratory
with adequate facilities for inspection
of the city milk supply that is now pro
vided for on the Ordinance books of
the city.
Just what sort of offer the Marlon
County Medical society will make to
the Board of Affairs in regard to us
ing the laboratory for the Milk and
Water Inspection has not been decid
ed as yet, but all of the physicians in
this association are insistent that
Fairmont should have. frequent milk
Inspection and daily water Inspection.
It Is practically certain that the Board
of Affairs will Include ample provision
and funds for this work In the budget
for next year which will be made up
beginning July 1, for the next fiscal
year.
Second District Hustlers
Going Strong for Big Prizes
The big biuldlng Is put up brick by
brick, one day doesn't show much
progress but a week does.
So In winning one of the many
prizes in the West Virginian's Seven
Thousand club, your progress may not
look big any one day, but at the end
of the week the hustler finds he or
she has made a big stride ahead.
This week a big special bonus of
fer is in force which gives all candi
dates a chance to add thousands of
extra votes" to their reserve. The of
fer provides that a certificate good
for Seventy-Five Thousand extra
votes shall bo given free with each
club of eight subscriptions for one
year which is turned in this week.
The subscriptions mfay be from three
months up and either new or renew
al; - 1r . r ?
Unfounded Rumors
Many unfounded ruhiors have been
floating around the districts about peo
ple who have millions and millions
of votes in reserve Such is not the
case. There are some who have se
cured "good-slsed". reserves but there
are none who have " yet climbed up
In the "millions and millions' class;
If you are. a real hustler,, don.'t have
a yellow streak running up and down
your spinal column you can enter to*
day, and ^in, without having to over
ewneiany very serious handicap.': ? ;
The only condition is that you must
"be a producer." ,
Those who depend entirely upon the
paper coupons are sure to receive a
rude shock to their delicate nature
when the list of prise-winners Is read
on the closing night It will be a much
worse shock than thejr would hare re
ceived hail they none out and been
' turned down onco or twice In their
efforts to write subscriptions.
The complimentary coupons are an
other source that cannot be depended
upon to bring home any prize. Why?
Not because they do not count up,
but because they4 do. not count for
anywhere near the amount of votes
you could get (or a few subscriptions,
and with much less work
District No. 1
District No. 1 Is falling behind. The
big prises at present are swaying to
ward District No. 2. It is up to you
folks In the Initial district to buck up
and show aome speeds It seems to.us
that the people In Fairmont are Just
as good hustlers as they have In some
of the smaller towns, and^they have
a good field in which to work, but
?o far, to date, they have lacked speed,
energy, pep and enthuslsm?everyone
ot the qualities which It takes to make
a winning race. But you can't tell.
Before the eighth day of July condi
tions may. be reversed >and 'XHatrlct
Nd. l;may yet cover tiferself with glory
and prises.
