Another Political
Ambition Satisfied
It is rumored tliat County Treasurer
Benson will not aspire to succeed him
self in the approaching election, but
will retire to private life. He is the
only one of the present oflieial family
who has grown tired of serving the
dear people, that we know of, all the
balance, with the exception of Commis
sioner Christensen, being willing to
again chance their political fates at the
ballot box.
Couuty Attorney Adair believes that
one good term deserves another, and he
is in the race to succeed himself, with
no opposition. The probate judgeship
seems to be a coveted job at this time,
as the present incumbent and probable
candidate to succeed himself will have
some opposition. Attorney Good, for
mer county attorney, has concluded to
aspire for the place, and Mr. Rice, the
defeated Progressive candidate for
school superintendent two years ago
has taken a fancy to the judicial ermintf
of the probate court

QUITS INDIAN PUBLIC 't SERVI
Tom LeSieur, who for a number of
years served on the Fort Hall Indian
reservation in the dual capacity of
chief of Indian police and Superintend
ent of live stock, has been succeeded ajs
chief of police by Joe Holbrook, and
will hereafter devote his entire atten
tion to the live stock industry, as super
intendent of live stock. His commis
sion as special officer of the Indian de
partment will expire July 1, and he ah*
sures us that it will not be renewed.
He is in the ■ city this morning bn
official business, and is stopping at the
Hotel Monarch.
For a good ninny years Tom LeSieur
was one of the best known and most
active special agents on the ' reserva
tion, and in dealing with renegades,
horsethieves and Indians who could npt
be governed. About a year ago he was
shot while attempting to capture an
Indian at Idaho Falls, the Indian also
being shot during the fight. It was but
recently that LeSieur completely recov
ered, a ball having gone through one of
his lungs.—Pocatello Tribune.
DID CRUM RETURN THE $5.00.
Acting Governor Herman H. Taylor
is inclined to the opinion that all tjiat
glitters is gold, and no doubt the
newsy who sold the present state's
chief executiv a Capital News last night
is of the same opinion. Acting Gover
nor Taylor bailed a newsy anil pur
chased a paper after feeling in his if est
pocket and handing over what he
thought was a five-cent piece. It hap
pened to be a $5 gold piece, and the
joke is on the Sandpoiut statesman
Borne political wag when lie heard the
joke, appended an alleged sequel to'the
Story, and that was that after accepting
the supposed five-cent piece the news
boy met George E- Crum, of Lewiston,
also one of the numerous Republican
gubernatorial candidates, and sold him
a paper, changing a 10-ceut piece and
handing the $5 gold piece, which he
Ihoqgbt whs a nickel, back in change.
This would have the acting governor
unwittingly contributing to the t*am
paign fund of one of his opponents.—

I built a great powe» plant at Graue,

"The building of the inter-urban I

business is being largely developed as
a result, as well as orchards and other
smaller realty holdings. ,
It was stated in Idaho FaU.i this week
bv a gentleman from Balt Lake who is
well acquainted with eonditiens there
and here, that the iie.vt railroad to be
built into Idaho Falls and this part of
the valley will be the road in question
—a continuation of the electric line
which at present terminates at Frank

is concerned is not only being cmfsid

for some time, but it is a fact that can
be accepted that a great deal of local

throughout all of the valley may lie ex

the course of the next few months.
"Railroads built on palier are not an
uncommon thing in the west and other
