upon Secretary Baker for a formal
ruling and was Informed that the
judge advocate general holds the de

to grant discharges where the only

When other grounds are presented the

With the militia of practically all

and the blow It would deal to proper

taken to instill respect for the mllltla,
ao Is the determination of the war de
