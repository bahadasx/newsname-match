Perrysburg defeated the fast
Teds of Toledo in an eleven inning
game Sunday afternoon, 4 to 3.
It was a see-saw affair and kept
the fans on edge throughout the
game.
The visitors were the first to
score. Pete singled and scored on
Freddy's foul hit. Perrysburg
forced ahead in the fourth inning.
C. Reis singled and was sacrificed
to second by Miller. On F. Reis'
infield tap C. Reis scored; F. Reis
going to third on the visitors' wild
throwing. On Harper's sacrifice
F. Reis scored. Pringle hit into a
fast double play. The Toledoans
tied the score -in the sixth on two
hits on errors, and went ahead in
the seventh on a walk, hit and an
error. This ended the Teds scor
ing. The locals came back in th
eighth and tied the score. C. Reis'
hit was sacrificed to third by
Miller and F. Reis and scored on
Harper's hit.
The winning run did not come
until the eleventh inning. Pringle
hit safe ; Tinney singled ; both run
ners moved up a base when Engle
was hit by a pitched ball, with the
bases full. C. Reis got his fifth hit
of the game and scored Pringle
with the winning run.
The features were the hitting
of Pete of the visitors, who gath
ered three hits; and the pitching
of Engle and hitting and base run
ning of C. Reis, getting five hits
and scoring two runs.
Engle had 12 strikeouts and al
lowed G hits.
Peltski had S strikeouts and 12
hits were gathered off his delivery.

Near the end of the Fort, in the deep
ravine,
Where the morning suns first shine,
They built a gallows years ago,
Constructed of oak and pine;
Thereon they hung a mortal man,
By the neck till he was dead.
While a morbid throng, devoid
shame,
Looked on, till life had fled.

And I often wonder, when near the
spot, .
Where the ugly scaffold stood,
If the dead man's chost, enrapt in
shroud,
Haunts not the nightly wood;
And whether while wandering to and

From fields beyond our ken,
It suffers in silence, or deems as un
just, The act of its fellow men?

As stated in the Journal last week,
the New Century Club closed their
year's work with a picnic at Walbridge
at which former members of the Club
were guests.
A dinner that was a feast and a
program that proved a gem were pro
vided for entertainment.
The welcome address was given by
Mrs. M. B. Cook, who soared to lofty
heights in her recital of the great ac.
complishments of the club. In part
she said:
"The past has shown many brilliant
years, but none has excelled 1916. No
height of literary attainment has been
left unsealed; no problem unsolved; no
question but has been discussed,
weighed and measured and decided
for this and all future generations.
. . . The realms not only of History
and Mystery; of Philology and Biol
ogy, but even of Poetry have been in
vaded and laurel wreaths wrested
therefrom, which now rest upon
already alarmingly distended brows."
She closed with a pleasing compli
ment and cordial greeting to the
guests who were the Alumni of the
club.
The response to the welcome address
was given by Mrs. Mills, who, looking
backward into the years that are gone,
spoke in rhyme of the first great
achievement of the club as follows:
"It is with pleasure and pride I re
spond to this greeting from the mem
bers to the graduates at the first an
nual meeting. A pleasure to meet, in
a social way, those who have left and
those who stay, and pride to have been
a member of so nbted a band, com
posed of the brightest and best in the
land. Of the things they've accom
plished I will mention a few; both in
Civic improvement and Club work, too:
There once was a place called 'Corn
Cob Hill,' and but for the efforts of
the club it would be called so, still.
just lor a laric tney made it into a
park, and this is how they helped pay
the bill: They had a nlav thev called a
"Convention," made up of Old Maids
and there was quite a contention, to
see who would be made young, nimble
and handsome, by Pinkerton Jones
who, with no thought of ransom, used
his wonderful elixir and remodeling
machine; accomplishing such wonders
as was never seen. The play was a
success and the proceeds helped pay
the bill, which eventually put an end
to corn cob hill."
She concluded by relating a pleasing
incident illustrating the manner in
which one member impressed upon the
mind of her young son the great
amount of wisdom she had obtained by
her membership in the club.
Mrs. G. W. Alexander gave the "His
tory of the Club" and in part said:
This club was organized very early
in the beginning of the Twentieth
Century, when two or three of Perrys
burg's intelligent, enthusiastic women
decided that something of the kind was
Continued on Fourth Pago.
The history of the Thirties, here
in this village, would not be com
plete without reference being
made to the trial and execution of
George Porter for' the murder of
Isaac Richardson.
Richardson seems to have been
an early settler in the Maumee
country; and in the twenties had
built a sawmill and tavern near
Rush-ta-boo Rock above Water
ville, on the Lucas county side of
the river. He has been described
by those who knew him, as a tall
and lean man, of sandy complex
ion and choleric temperament. He
seems always to have been in
trouble with his neighbors, and
the early court records of Wood
county bear witness to the fact
that he was arrested and fined
several times for petty offenses;
such as keeping tavern and selling
whiskey without a license; for
abusing an officer of the law, etc.
Richardson's tavern was a log
structure, composed of two wings,
with a hallway through the center,
and it stood near the bank of the
Maumee.
On the other hand, Porter, who
killed Richardson, was a man of
probable blameless habits and dis
position, and was generally re
spected in the community round
about. He was a Canadian, and
being a carpenter, had come to
this country to seek employment.
He hired out to Richardson to
work in his sawmill and at carpen
ter work; but for a long time had
never received any pajr for his
services, his employer putting him
off, with one excuse and another.
Finally, becoming hard up for
money, the claim was pressed, and
it was then that Richardson re
fused to pay at all, telling Porter
to get the money the best way he
could, besides taunting and abus
ing him whenever they chanced to
meet. Tt is also said that Richard
son had made a trip to Canada
where he had collected moneys
due there to Porter and which he
had 'failed to turn over. This was
also another bone of contention.
This all happened during the sum
mer of 1830, eighty-six years ago.
Things went on from bad to worse.
Porter became penniless and con
stantly broded over his troubles.
It was in "Dog Days," on the
afternoon of the 12th of August
while woi'king in the harvest field,
ou the old Reed farm below
Watervillo, that he is said to have
resolved to take Richardson s life.
It was a sultry afternoon. Stimu

brain with draughts of whiskey.

Asparagus cutting should be
discontinued during tho latter
part of June. Begin to feed the
plantation as soon as cutting stops.
Apply a mulch hi the furrows and
cross harrow. Poultry makes the
best mulch. Make successive
plantings of sweet corn, beans,
beets, carots and lettuce during
tho month. . Celery plants should
go into the field the latter part of
this month or early in July.
Watch tho cabbage plants for
worms. Use fresh white hellebore
at the rate of one ounce to three
gallons of water as a spray when
they appear. Apply bordeaux
mixture to celery, cucumbers,
melons and potatoes at frequent
intervals, at least every 10 days.
For the potato beetle on potatoes,
egg plant or tomatoes use arsenate
of lead at the rate of three pounds
to 50 gallons of water as a spray
and apply thoroughly. The arse
nate may be used with bordeaux
at the same rate as for clear water.
If troubled with squash vine borer
in squashes and pumpkins, apply
tobacco dust liberally at frequent
intervals close about the stems and
encourage the rooting of the vines
along the stems by drawing moist
soil up over them.
SOME OBSERVATIONS.
Three hundred and twenty-five
railroads went through the last fis
cal year without a single fatality
to a passenger in a train accident.
The "safety first" campaign has
amply justified itself.
One way to make friends, keep
your advice to yourself.
The supply of common sense
never exceeds the demand.
What has become of the old-
fashioned kid who used to walk on
stilts?
We never could figure why they
call a big gun ''she," when it can
be silenced.
More men can remember the
number of fish they caught last
Sunday than the text of the ser
mon they heard.
Yes it does, for just about a
dozen of them are doing it right
this minute by growing an aero of
corn in a state-wide corn contest
promoted by the Board of Agricul
ture. The boy growing the best
acre of corn will be sent on a trip
to New York, Washington and '
Philadelphia aiext fall after the
crop is harvested, along with tho
wining boy from nearly every
other township and county in the
state of Ohio.
The boys of Perrysburg town
ship have shown the right spirit,
as was to be expected, but say,
boys, you will have to he most
mighty careful, for you don't
know how many of tho old
"boys," Dad and all the neigh
bors, arc watching you to see what
you do. They really won't believe
that you can beat them at their
own game until the records prove
that you do, but if you keep at
that acre all summer in the same
spirit that you have started in on
the contest, you will surprise even
yourself when you come to husk
ing time.
Just the first of this week one
boy who has entered his aero
found that he had several hills
missing, and asked if ho could
transplant a couple of hills from
another acre to his own. It was
explained that this was not the
thing to do, upon which the boy's
face perceptibly fell; but then
and hero is my point you should
have seen him brighten np again
when it was further explained how
and why he would get better re
sults if he just transplanted some
of that stored-up energy from his
good right arm to his good sharp
hoe-handle. '
Boys, we're with you.
