REVIVAL MEETING r
CLOSES.
The revival meeting which
has been in progress for the last
two weeks at the Baptist Church
came to a close last Friday
night. Rev, Alexander was. a
most entertaining speaker and
had an eloquent flow of language
and - expressed his thoughts in
words that were not only beau
tiful but were powerful and
convincing. His earnestness
and sincerity in his words is the
secret of Bro. Alexander's suc
cess, being so instrumental in the
salvation of souls. Altho the
weather was very inclement,
much good was accomplished
anyhow to all those who attend
ed and the Church was greatly
revived.

OBEYED INSTRUCTIONS.
A traveling salesman died
very suddenly in Kalamazoo.
His relatives telegraphed the
florist to make a wreath ; the rib
bon should be extra wide, with
the incription, "Rest in Peace"
on both sides, and if there is
room, "We shall Meet in Heav
en." The florist was out of town and
his new assistant handled the job.
It was a startling- floral piece
which turned up at the funeral.
The ribbon was extra wide, and
bore the incription : "Rest in
Peace on Both Sides, and if there
is Room We Shall Meet in Heav
en.

EVERYBODY COME.
It's dollars to doughnuts that
you'll see one of the best reels
ever shown at the Dixie Wednes-
day, night June 28th. The
reel called, "The adventures of
a Boy Scout will be shown, and
you're urged to see this 5-reel
feature.
The Scouts don't expect to
make much money on this reel.
We want every man, woman and
child in Tracy City to be present.
You'll enjoy it', and you'll .be
proud of the boy Scouts.
The Scouts do need a little cash
just now. The season for great
est development and out-of-door
life is here and we haven't
enough money to purchase the
things we need. We're trying
in a legitimate way to raise a
few dollars by offering this boy
Scout reel. The Scouts will also
try to make a little more by hav
ing charge of the drinks and
cream at the joint picnic. We
want a large crowd to attend both
of these places of enjoyment.
In the near future, tie Scouts
want to purchase equipment for
camping. We intend to" meet
pther Scouts on a joint camp, and
we need many things. If you
patronize the Dixie and see the
Scout reel as well as attend the
picnic you'll be a hero.. This
camp will be a good thing for the
boys. They'll be greatly bene
fitted by it, and Mr. MacOullum,
of Sewanee, who played 4 years
on the football team, will assist.
Heis a good director, a splendid
man. Other men will be present
to aid in making this camp bene
ficial. Let us do our part by aid
ing the Scouts. .
