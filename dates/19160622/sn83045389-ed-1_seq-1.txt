Allies Use Influence j
on Carranza in Hope
of Preventing Breafy
Charge German Agencies
With Stirring Up Feeling
in Mexico Against the
United States.
WASHINGTON. June 21.?While Gen
eral Carranza aiul his Cabinet had un
der consideration to-ilay the American
rejection for tins demand for tho recall
of General Pershing's troops from
Mex:?o, European diplomats were
exerting pressure on the first chief to
prevent him from iroing to war with
tho United States, according? to ad
vices reaching here from Mexico City.
Some intimation as to Carranza's
mxt move was expected hourly to
night at the State Department.
Special Agent Itodgers. m reporting
that the American note was taken up
hy the first chief and his Cabinet, was
unable to forecast the action of the
de facto government or to throw light
on what was going on in the Mexican
capital. From other sources, however,
it was learned that the entente allies
were particularly anxious that noth
ing should occur at this time to shut
oft tho oil supplies for the British and
French navy from the Tampico fields,
and that they were using their in
fluence to prevent a break with the
l'nlted States.
Allied diplomatic representatives in
Mexico believe, too. that German In
fluence has been working on Carranza
in an effort to create a situation that
might embarrass the enemies of tb'
central powers.
?Einn\ i:\or.y active
l.\ STIUHIVK l|? I'KKMNG
They have asserted that German
agencies have been active in stirring
up feeling against the United States
not only in Mexico, but throughout
South mid ''entraI America, to prevent
this country from securing trade
formerly controlled by German mer
chants.
It is understood that the diplomats
have pointed out to General Carranza
that the American note only declines
to consider immediately any suggestion
that its troops be withdrawn from
Mexico, and th.it ft i|uoii>g portion
of the agreement between Generals
Scott and Obregoti providing for the
gradual withdrawal of the forces.
Another suggestion Is that the dis
pute ,.ver border conditions could well
be referred r?? an international commis
sion under the treaty of 1S4S between
the two countries. Diplomatic officials
here arc- known to believe that Presi
dent Wilson would consider this sug
gestion if lie met with no interference
In the meantime in his efforts to guard
th.? American border from bandits
A study of all General Carranza'.*
communications and actions during the
last few months has given little ground,
officials feci, for a hopeful view of t in*
situation. His attitude has been ohm
of growing hostility, and oltlclals are
not. inclined to believe that it could
be readily overcome.
PltESfl)HST ItE VIEWS MEHIIEIt*
OK |>. r. X ATI(l.\A I. t.l V It I>
While these matters occupied the at
tention of the State Department. Presi
dent Wilson stood on the sidewalk in
front of the White House to-day to re
view 2,003 members of the District of
Columbia National Guard as they
passed up Pennsylvania Avenue on
their way to Fort Myer. Va.
Mr. Wilson's appearance, accompanied
by Secretary linker, was greeted with
cheers from (he crowds gathered along
the avenue. The President's eyes fol
lowed particularly the men in citizen's
clothing, but carrying rifles and bells,
who appeared at intervals. They were
recruits who rushed to offer them
selves since-the call for the National
Guard went out.
At tho War Department telegrams
came during the clay from many States
reporting the progress of the mobiliza
tion. Scores of regiments are under
canvas to-night. As yet no marching
orders for the border have been given,
but they will go before the weel< ends.
"It is quite certain." Secretary Baker
said, "that some ..f the regiments will
go to the border shortly, hut whether
that means in a clay or two more I can
not say.'v.
Major-General Soott, chief of staff,
! indicated that the first organizations to
j complete muster into the service, find
. which ari> well placed geographically,

I'll It STATE ALLOTMENT
The general plan under which the
State allotment of troops to he culled
out was made is1 known as the twelve
! division plan, prepared by the War De
partment. in v:<12. A later scheino of
organization has superseded this for
i use in a great war, hut tne old plans
meet, the present situation best. Under
i it the units called out represent tweive
fully armed divisions when properly
grouped. At peace strength they would
total 100,000 men; at full wnr strength,
approximately 250.000. The organiza
tions President Wilson has summoned
are to be expanded to as near that
maximum as possible by recruiting In
the States from which they came.
The scheme of reorganization for the
regular army under the new army bill
also was announced to-day. It pro
vides for the addition of seven regi
ments of infantry, two of cavalry, three
of field and h*-ivy artillery and two of
engineers. The act. takes effect on July
I, and by the plan announced the new
regimer:t< composing the first annual
increment of increase will be created
i on that date, giving General Funston
twelve new regimental units.
Officials say the reorganization can
i take place on the border without iin
pairing the efficiency of the force. All
the officers necessary for the new regi
ments will be drawn from the existing
organization, and promotions all along
| the line will follow. The effect will be
| to leave the army virtually without
! second ieutenants, and it is said here
1 that the additional officers provided for
(under the Ml! will be fed Into the ser
vice. There will be many promotions
j also among the unlisted men. The sca
: soiled men will be found in ranks, of
the privates, and the gap to he filled
j will be onlv in the grade <>f private.
Marching orders for National Guard
'organizations summoned to the . colors
under President Wilson's call are still
heltl tip .it the War Department pend
ing completion of the mobilisation of
th?- troops at. State camps.
.Just as soon as a sufficient number
of the guardsmen have been mustered
into the Federal service, the War De
partment will act on General Funs
ton's report of yesterday, stating the
number of units ho desired, and to
what points he desired them forwarded.
n.M.I I'llKl<l.IIIXAItV Hin'OIlT
ni:\tni;s \\ah dki'ahtmkvi*
Only preliminary reports on the
progress of the mobilization In vari
ous States had reached the War De
partment to-day. These were viewed
as satisfactory.
Secretary Baker said the suggestion
that I he senior class at West Point
Military Academy be graduated im
mediately for active service was under
consideration, hut that no decision had
been reached. The cadets have com
pleted three years of their work, and
could be oommlssioned as second lieu
tenants immediately if the emergency
warrants such steps.
The department had no additional
|-advices from General Funston regard
ing the movements of Carranza troops
near the border or in the vicinity of
i General Pershing's column in .Mexico.

News of the battle was received In
I Juarez early this afternoon by Gen
j oral Franciaco Gonzales, Carranza com
i man dor of the military zone of tho
border. For some reason. General Gon
zales kept the story secret until late
in the afternoon, when an American.
.7. C. Hubble, teturning to the border
from the interior, brought to El Paso
; th<> news that he had seen numbers
i of Mexican dead along the. Mexican
i Central Railroad tracks at Villa
Ahumadu, and had been told that thero
1 had been an encounter.
General Gonzales's first step after
confirming the news was to issue a
i statement placing the blame on the
' American commander. He charged that
' th?* American troops fired first on fha
j Mexicans, and that their .shots were
j directed at a courier who had Just pro
I sen ted to them a request that they
i retire.
I ; Army otllcials declared disbelief to
j night in General Gonzales's assertions.
I The opinion was expressed that if the
!J Americans fired on th<* Mexicans, they
'did so because it was necessary, in
I order to Insure tlieir own safety.
II General Trevino's recent warning to
j General Pershing not !o send his troop*
? east, south or west of their positions
! was recalled.
