PARTING SONGS GIVEN
Strains of "Old Missouri"
Are Heard as the Militia
Leaves for Camp.
With cheers, good wishes and tears
from nearly l.r.ou persons as a fare
well. 70 young men of the Columbia
.Machine (Jim Company sang "Old Mis
souri" from the back of the train as
tliey left last flight for Nevada, Mo.,
where the National Guar.! of Missouri
Is lieing mobilized.
Eighteen years ago, Columbia sent
a company of her young men to the
Spanish-American war; before that
the citizens of this community re
sponded to the call when the States
were divided against themselves, but
no company has ever been given the
send-off tendered the Columbia Ma
chine Gun Company, N. G. M., last
night.
Promptly at 7:P0 o'clock last night
the enlisted men gathered at the arm
ory. The crowd had already begun to
arrive, and all during the evening
groups stood around the corners talk
ing in low tones or mixed with the
company, wishing the members good
luck and telling them goodbye.
Hand Lends Way to Station.
Hy 11 o'clock there were two lines
down Broadway from Tenth street to
the depot. When the boys started
marching to the station, accompanied
by a xoluntcer band, the crowd cheer
ed. Many an old man silently lifted
his hat and stood at attention as the
colors went by. After a moment the
cheering subsided and only the "left,
right, left, right," the honk of auto
mobiles and the low hum of conversa
tion was heard.
The company reached the station.
Lieutenant K. K. Major put his com
pany through a short exhibition drill.
An old man tottered up to the line,
reached in and grasped his son hy the
arm. He started up the street, with
the curious eyes of hundreds following
him. He could not part from his son.
Over on one side was an old white
bearded man. standing erect, gazing at
the company.
"Jim," he called to the man who
had taken his son from the ranks.
Sends UN Son to Front.
The three talked for a minute. What
they said only they know, but when the
conversation had ended "Jim"
straightened up. shook hands with his
son and sent him hack to the ranks.
Perhaps the old white-bearded man
had told of the time when he enlisted.
Perhaps he had recalled the days of
9S or V,t. Perhaps who knows?
Over on another side an old woman
was trying bravely to hold back the
tears. She succeeded, but her eyes
seemed misty as she gazed at the little
squad of men performing their maneu
vers. The company halted. The band
struck up "nixie." Hats came off, and
the crowd broke into cheers. The
company broke ranks, scattering here
and there for last good-hys. One
group sang. The songs were appro
priate, and when they ended up with
the "Varsity" cheers broke forth
again.
It was time for the train to leave.
The last farewells were taken, a few
tears were shed, though most mothers
bravely surrendered their sons. As
the boys stepped on the train they sang
"Old Missouri."
Tlie bell rang, handkerchiefs were
waved and the train pulled out.

Traffic Question Taken Up
John Silver Is Made
City Engineer.
Columbia police cannot submit
their prisoners to grilling third de
gree methods or chastise tliem in any
way in order to cause a confession,
for the City Council, after hearing a
paper by Councilman Walker, in
which lie cited cases where prisoners
had been unnecessarily abused, last
night voted that these methods must
not be continued. The case was put
in the form of a motion and passed.
John Silver was appointed city en
gineer in the absence of J. Paul Price,
who left the Machine Gun Company.
It was unanimously voted to make
his salary $70 a month.
The attention of the Council was
called to the pools of water that col
lect at Ninth and Kim streets after
each rain. Councilman Walker sug
gested that the demoval of the trash
gathered there might remedy this.
Matter of Refuse Undecided.
The placing of refuse on the streets
was brought up for discussion. Some
of the counciimen were in favor of
having big trash cans placed around
town. It was finally decided to take
up the matter with the Civic League.
The building of a sidewalk on Court
street was recommended by Council
man Reed. The matter was referred
to the street committee to see if the
property owners wanted the city to
build it or put it in themselves sub
ject to the city engineer's direction.
A signal service for the night po
lice was discussed, but no action was
taken.
The erection of a concrete bridge
over Flat Branch on Walnut street,
west of the City Hall, was brought
up by Councilman Reed. The matter
was referred to the street commit
tee. City to Haw Traffic Posts.
The erection of traffic posts was
brought up by Councilman McDonald.
City Attorney Starrett, who was in
Iowa City, la., recently, suggested
that traffic posts similar to the ones
used in that city be erected here. Ho
said that they were made of a section
of tile about four feet long and eigh
teen inches in diameter.
This tile was placed at the intersec
tion of the streets, and on four sides
"Safety First" was painted. The
tile was hollow, which permitted a
round wooden post to bo placed in
the center and held in place by pack
ing dirt around it.
At the top of the post, which ex
tends about four feet above the tile,
cross bars are placed with the sign
"Keep to the right," painted thereon.
A motion to erect such posts on
Eighth, Ninth, Tenth and Broadway
was adopted.
To Care for Police Automobile.
The question of a place to keep the
police automobile was discussed, and
Councilman Klass made the motion
that the police and street committee
be authorized to provide for the car.
The motion was adopted.
Councilman Walker recommended
that the automobiles on Broadway be
parked in the center or the street. The
motion was made and adopted that the
City Attorney draw an ordinance for
the parking of automobiles on Broad
way. CITY TO HAVE NEW HFILDING
Structure Will House Sweeper, Motor
Car. Tools and an Oi'lice.
A building, to house the new street
sweeper and police automobile and
furnish room for a tool house and
water and light office will be built

about 20 by 10 feet, just one story
high, containing four rooms.
Counciimen Virgil Hawkins and F.
I). Alton are on the committee to pre
pare plans for the structure. The work
will begin immediately.
Women i naie Mass Metlhig.
A mass meeting of women attending
the Summer Session will be held in
Read Hall at 4:30 o'clock next Tues

meeting will be to promote the better

ENTERTAIN STUDENTS,
MUTM URGES
Hospitality Is an Asset, Re
tiring Principal Tells the
Commercial Cluh.
I'RAISESTHEOFFICIALS
Resolution Passed to Send
Greetings to Gun Com
pany at Nevada.
To do the thing nearest at hand
and thus grow into the larger duties
of their organization was the advice
K. B. Cautiiorn, retiring principal of
the Columbia High School, gave in his
address t the members of the Com
mercial Club at the weekly luncheon
at Harris' today. Mr. Cauthorn's talk
gave a review of the past as well as
suggestions for the future. His con
nection with the Commercial Club
dates from the time of its organiza
tion, when he was secretary.
One of the first things in the way
of immediate duties is, Mr. Cauthorn
said, the entertainment of Summer
Session students, a plan already being
worked up by the club. He commend
ed this not only because of the spirit
of hospitality thus shown hut because
it will bo a good thing for Columbia
itself. Columbia, in Mr. Cauthorn's
eyes, is a place which is to become
more and more popular is a meeting
place, and a reputation for hospi
tality, together with the new hotel
and state highway will make many
changes In Columbia in the next few
years. Views Co-Opcrntiou As Essential.
Co-operation in all city affairs, par
ticularly the recent school-bond is
sue, was mentioned by the speaker
as one of the excellent features of the
Commercial Club. "The Club," he
said, "is a clearing house for the
good works of the communitA. It is
not looked on, as it once was. as a
dictator. Now it is the work of the
orgifiiiutiou to inform the business
man of conditions in the town and,
with the City Council and the School
Hoard, to accomplish things for the
town."
(letting together Mr. Cauthorn men
tioned as another thing that the Com
mercial Club had learned to do. A
much-to-be-desired work of the club
would be, ho said, to prevent the
"knocking" of public officials. "Ev
ery one," he said, "needs some one
to stand by and bold up his hands
instead of making him feel that lie is
a grafter and a crook."
Public Officials Are Commended.
In this connection the purchase of
the fire truck and the more recent
acquisition of the police chief's car
were mentioned by Mr. Cauthorn and
commended. He expressed his be
lief that Columbia has public offi
cials of more than usual ability and
that the fire department, in particu
lar, is highly efficient.
Turning to school affairs, Mr.
Cauthorn spoke of the excellent rec
ord Columbia has as a school town
which holds its students past the
high school, graduating a senior class
larger than the freshmen class en
tering. He.' quoted an investigator
who said that Columbia children
were having more done for them in
proportion to the expenditures than
in any other town in the country.
Sends Greetings to Gun Company.
A motion to the effect that the
visiting officials of the M. K. & T.
Railway be made honorary members
of the club, in view of their apprecia
tion of their entertainment here, was
passed. A second motion that greet
ing lie sent to the Columbia Gun Com
pany at Nevada was also passed.
In accordance with the motion that
a committee be appointed to see what
the club might do with regard to the
improvement of the Mincola Hills,
I,. M. Defoe, president of the club,
appointed the following committee:
J. A. Hudson, chairman, S. F. Con
ic'. W. T. Anderson, John N. Taylor
ami Mayor J. M. Battcrton. The com
mittee on resolutions with respect to
the leaving of Mr. Cauthorn, is com
posed of the Rev. M. A. Hart, chair
man, N. T. Gentry and Mayor J. M.
Battcrton.

Friday .Musical Kuiiing.
The program to be presented to
morrow night in the University Audi
torium at the second concert of the
Friday Musical Evenings by Basil
Gauntlett is slightly more modern in
style than the one given last week.
In accordance with his idea of
playing at least one senata at each
concert, Mr. Gauntlett will present to
morrow night the "Beethoven Sonata
in C major. Opus 2, No. .?." This num
ber is in four movements Allegro con
brio. Adagio, Scherzo, and Allegro as
sai (Rondo). It is perhaps one of the
best known of Beethoven's sonatas.
A set of variations and fugue on
a theme by Handel, a composition by
J. Brahms, a composer new to the
summer audiences, will be played.
Brahms is a writer of a comparative
ly late period.
Probably the. most interesting part
of tomorrow night's program to
many, at least will be the "Phan
tasiestuecke" ("Moods and Fancies")
by Robert Schumann, the noted Ger
man composer. This number or set
of numbers consists of eight little
pieces: "At Eventide". "Exultation",
"Questions". "Whims", "In the Night",
"A Tale", "Dream Tangles", and final
ly "The End of It", each one self-explanatory
and descriptive of the niabi
title.
The last numbers will be two selec
tions by Franz I.iszt. The first of
these is "Harmonies du Soir" ("Even
ing Harmonies"), and the second,
concluding the program, "The Me
phisto Waltz."
