THIRTY 10 CENTS
PAID FOR WOOL
Local Growers Receive Flutterl 115
Bids, But Few Sell. Ike Howard
Gets Highest Price. Many
Refuse to Offer Clips
For Bids.
Ike Howard received the high price
of the 1916 wool sales held in this
city last Saturday. He sold his clip
consisting of 2700 pounds of coarse
wool to Crlmmins & Pierce of Boston.
The price received was 32 cents. So
far as we know, this is the largest
price offered this year to any Oregon
wool grower.
The entire sale was marked with
the Indifference on the part of the
growers to sell their clips. Many of ;
the sheepmen refused to put up their
wool for bids, probably thinking that:
they will be able to sell at better
prices at private sales. All bids of
fered Saturday were high, in view of
prices offered in previous years.
The following clips were bid
on
Saturday, some selling and

Union Pacific to Put In New Ralls and
Roadbed From Kansas City West.
Officers of the Union Pacific system
have Just agreed on an expenditure
of approximately $1,000,000 for lm-'
proving the Kansas City -Denver
line. There has been much work on
this road for several years and when
that which has just been authorized
is finished the line will be on a par
with the Omaha-Ogden route of the
Union Pacific.
One of the items just authorized
Is the ballasting with Sherman gran
ite of the line between Oakley and
Ellis, seventy-five miles! This will
complete the ballasting of the line
between Kansas City and Limon,
Colo., 650 miles. This will cost about
$300,000. The entire system from
Kansas City to the Colorado termin
als will be relaid with 90-pound steel.
This will cost about $200,000. There
will be new steel bridges put In cost
ing $125,000.
Electrical block signals will be in
stalled between Salina and Ellis at an
estimated cost of $175,000. This will
complete the electrical block signals
between Kansas City and Ellis, about
803 miles.
This Is one of the biggest expend!
lures made by any Western road this
season and the work Is to be pushed
as fast as men and money will do it.
WALKING DISEASE
DEATH TO HORSES
By State Veterinarian.
The losses that have been due to
this malady of horses in Morrow and
Gilliam counties have reached an ag
gregate of thousands of dollars and
naturally the situation is viewed with
alarm,
The disease is one that has
previously appeared in this section,
though last year the' country was
practically free from it. We have
cried to make a thoro investigation
and have come here with our minds
free from any previous or formed
opinion. From the history of the
several cases here in Morrow county
it would seem that the trouble was
indirectly due to either an Infection
or a poison that was taken into the
system with either the food or water.
The first cases investigated pointed
rather strongly to a source of plant
poisoning, larkspur, death camas and
lupine were found, the latter plant In it will require probably half a million

the poisonous plants. On another
farm where ten head of animals had
died, no poisonous plants could bo
found in the pasture, and also a cow I
had died with symptoms that would
indicate possibly a disease Hemor
rhage Septicemia, which might be the
disease that the stricken horses were
dvine from. In order to arrive at ,
some definite conclusion we vaccinat
ed horses on three farms with a vac
cine thtrt is known to prevent Hemor
rhage Septicemia and some of the
allied diseases that resemble this
malady.
Tf this vaccine offers protec--'
tion it will be reasonable to believe
that the disease Is of the Hemor-
rhagtc Septicemic order. It should ;
be said that this disease Hemorrhagic
Septicemia is not contagious, it is in- (
factious, that is. it is contracted from ,
the infection that comes out of the
soil and generally enters the system
through the drinking water.
It Is possible, should this be the
ailment, that the disease is held over
from year to year by improperly dis
posed carcases. The disease Is'known
in hn rrnvnlent clurine vnrs in which

Tliis f-pring being one of frequent
rains would be a source of much veg
etation In the water, and the winter
being a severe one left many bands of
horses quite poor in flesh and natur
ally weak in resistance, hence the
reason for the ailment this year and
the absence of it last year. The dis
ease, In my opinion, is not infectious.
Animals will not give it directly to
one another, although the presence
of a dead animal left nnburied will
increase the amount of Infective ma
terial for next year and a sick animal
in certain stages might be the means
of distributing some of the Infectious
organisms, but it would seem that
the infection is not transmissable
from animal to animal. On a great

horses dying during former years this

plants or an infection that had lain
dormant last year.
Owners should make all changes

Pastures should be changed. Water
should be changed or purified by add

Peter Borg Came to Morrow County
in 1880 and for Years Was Lead
er in Heppner's Business
and Political Life.
Peter Borg died at his home in
Portland Sunday morning after a lin-
gering illness. At the time of his
deatii ne was 75 'years of age, being
born in Christianstod, Sweden on
February 30, 1S40. Although Mr.
Borg had been a continuous resident
of Heppner for a long number of
: years, he removed to Portland a few
'years ago, after he retired from bus-
iness.
Mr. Borg received his education in
the public school and the military
acad,emy In his native country, taking
an exceptionally thorough course in
the latter Institution Hn served In
the regular army for bIx years. In '
the year 1866 he was married to Miss
Annie Anderson and two years later
they left the old country, coming to
America. They stopped first at Chi
cago, where Mr. Borg opened up a
jewelry store. From there the fam
ily moved to Carroll county, Missou
ri and Mr. Borg followed the farming
Industry for ten years.
After spending ten years as a far
mer in Missouri, Mr. Borg heeded the
call of the west. He fitted out a
prairie schooner and started on the
Innn nttnrlnnri Innvnoif QW Mnntlin
long overland journey. Six months
time was taken up in this trip, Mr.
Borg taking plenty Of time to look
over the territory through which he
passed.
Upon arriving In Heppner, Mr.
Borg opened up a jewelry store and
became one of the city's most active
citizens. In 1894 he was elected
mayor and served with credit to hlm-
self and town for one term. He made
a success of his business and invest
ed considerable money in Morrow
county wheat land and city property
In Hepnper. He later disposed of his
farming land but up to the time of
his death still owned valuable busi
ness lots and residences in this city.
Mr. Borg was once a member of
the Oregon National Guard, being
second lieutenant of Company E, 3rd
Regiment, and was officer in charge
of the regiment which greeted the
representatives of the railroads at
the driving of the golden spike which
commemorated the completion of the
line Into this section. He was a mem
ber of Heppner Lodge No. 69, A. F.
& A. M., and a charter member of
both the Knights of Pythias and the
Elk lodges of this city. He was also
a 32nd degree Scottish Rite Mason.
The funeral was held on Wednes
day afternoon at 1:30 o'clock from
the South Methodist church, . with
which he had been affiliated when liv-

of the Mexican de facto government.
De facto government failed to avail
itself of the opportunity to establish
peace and order in Mexico.
Banditry and outrages against
American citizens both in Mexico and
across the border continue without
government.
De facto government asks for the
immediate withdrawal of American
troops from Mexico.
Request is not complied with for
the same reason that United States
originally sent troops Into Mexico,
that Is, Carranza has never shown yet
that he intends to restore order
among his people and arrest any fur
ther destruction of American life and
property.
Secretary Lansing points out In his
note to Carranza that it is not terri
tory which the United States desires,
for had this been the case, a much
better oportunity could have been
taken 'advantage of several months
ago, when Mexico was badly rent with
internal strife.

After Leading Several Innings O to 3,
Locals are Overwhelmingly Iieat

,The lone jinx proved Heppner's
undoing fo a third time this "season,
at the depot grounds Sunday, and at-
ter it seemed that the local boys sure
ly had the game salted away for
keeps, the jinx came In for several
runs for the visitors. The final score
was 12 to 7 with lone on the long end
of the scoring. v
For several innings, beginning with
the 1st frame.Heppner took the lead
and before the game had progressed
far, the score keeper had chalked up
six runs for the locals and only three
for the visitors.
Sperry, pitching for the visitors,
got off to a bad start and things look
ed blue for him up to the fifth Inning.
It was here that Cochran, lone back
stop, was forced to leave the game on
account of an injured finger. His
place was taken by Coshow, who had
been playing in the outfield. At once
Sperry's form seemed to change and
his work from there to the finish was
of high order.

MUSTARD WEED IS
MENACE TO CROPS
lone Correspondent.
While contemplating the problem
of the Jim Hill mustard, and the
great abundance of it growing along
the public roads in various sections,
the thought comes to mind that this
pest might be turned to good use. It
should be cut and put In the road
bed, taking the place of the usual
strawing that is necessary to be done
before the fall hauling of the grain
sets in. This mustard would cer
tainly be as good a road preserver as
the straw, and by cutting it out of the
lanes now, before it goes to seed, a
double purpose would be served. The
weeds should be removed from the
public highways for the protection of
the lands adjoining and what better
use" could be made of them? There
is a fight on sure enough by the far
mers to get rid of the weed pest, and
it is going to be up to them to work
harder and more persistently In the
future than they have in the past.
This will not prove a bad Investment,
cither, as we believe the farm lands
will pay better returns and produce
surer crops by more work. This is
the expression we have had from
some of our most successful farmers
men who have to work to keep
their lands free from weeds and are
getting the results. This road mat
ter, however, is worthy of considera
tion and should receive immediate at
tention. ,
A ride around much of the wheat
growing section north of lone on Sun
day reveals the fact that there is
much good grain now growing out
that way. A number of fields are
pretty badly infested with Jim Hill
mustard and large quantitits of this
weed fills the lanes in all directions.
This will cause some trouble at har
vest time but there will be a lot of
grain produced just the same. It was
also noted that there are numerous
large fields of grain that appear to
be entirely free from weeds of any
sort.f Lots of the grain Is now head
ed afid seems to be developing well.
Weatnef conditions are " Just rigTit
and it would seem that this part of
Morrow county is going to come back
good and strong this year.
Farmers out this way are suffer
ing the loss of many horses again
this season from the walking disease.
A. A. McCabe has lost fifteen head of
work stock and colts and others are
having trouble of the same sort, and
deaths are occurring right along, in
dicating that there may be an epi
demic of the disease going through
the county. J. L. KIncaid, who lost
so heavily a number of years ago, is
again having trouble with the disease
among his horses and has lost some
of the best animals on the place. Mr.
McCabe reports that his horses seem
to be getting well now and he hopes
to suffer no more loss from the dis
ease. Many farmers in from the country
yesterday were rejoicing over the
good rain that fell Tuesday night. A
few hot days last week caused no
little apprehension as It was feared
that damage would be done to the
growing grain. Any serious hurt to
the grain was -prevented by the time
ly arrival of cool weather and now
all danger seems to have passed. The
creek farmers are not rejoicing so
much, however, over the wet weather
as many of them have hay down and
the rain does that no good, but all
cannot be pleased at the same time.
E. M. Shutt was in town Monday
and took out a new buck rake. He
is getting things in shape to begin his
harvest which promises to be abund
ant. The writer was offered a job
running the new rake, but owing to
other pressing business was com
pelled to pass it up. We worked at
this job once for a half day and we
know just how to do it, providing
we are furnished with a team that
can manage the affair with little as
sistance from the driver. We man
aged to stay on the rig and the horses
did the rest.
Work of razing the old I. O. O. F.

HIS' PICUIC
IS BIG SUCCESS
Hundreds of Visitor Attend Farmer
Party and Listen to Addresses.
J. D. Brown Explains
. Rural Credits Bill.
The Third Annual Farmers' Unioa
Picnic was held in this city last Sat
urday according to schedule and hun
dreds of visitors from over the coun- '
ty were present to Indulge In the
pleasures of the day.
The program opened at 11 o'clock
in the morning at the fair grounds, a
platform having been constructed out
in the open under the , spreading
shade trees, where seats had been
provided. Mayor S. E. Notson ex
tended welcome to the visiting farm
ers on behalf of the city of Heppner.
In his few remarks he paid a tribute
U the farmer and spoke of the com
munity idea, an idea which is grow
ing each year. Formerly the town
people went to the country for an
event of this kind, but now according
to Mr. Notson, the country people
come to the town. Mr. Notson drift
ed into his favorite subject, that of
education, and spoke briefly of the
important part which the farmers are
taking in educational advancement.
"Learning of the growth of plants,"
said Mr. Notson, "is as important, if
not more important, than extracting
the cube root in figures."
Mr. Notson's address of welcome
was responded to by E. R. Huston,
president of the Morrow County, Far-
mers' Union. President Huston stat-
ed that the idea among many people
was to the effect that the Farmers'
Union was organized with a view of
putting the retail merchant out of
business. Mr. Huston refuted this
and in addition read the pre-amble
and the constitution of the Farmers'
Educational and Co-Operative Union
of Aumrica. . . , .. . r
C. P; Strain, county assessor of -Umatilla
county addressed the au-.
dience at some length treating the
trust question and showing the rela
tion of the Farmers' Union to the big
trusts and the work which the Union
is doing to bust the trusts and cut '
down the present high cost of living.
J. D. Brown, state president of thn
Farmers' Union, discussed the rural
credits bill which will be on the bal
lot in November. This bill is con
sidered the best in the line of farm
credits that has yet been proposed
and if it is passed, it is believed by
those who know, that it will mean
much for the agricultural advance
ment of the State of Oregon.
A little diversion was brought
about in the afternoon through a line
of sports which took place on the
street, just outside the fair grounds.
Goldie Cummlngs won the small girls'
race; Conser Adkins was winner of
the sack race; Jimmie Cowins won
both the 100-yard and 50-yard dashes
and Carl Cason won the potato race.
Free dancing in the pavilion in the
afternoon proved to be an attraction,
many of the young people indulging
In this favorite pastime. The Uni
ted Orchestra of Pendleton, under
the able leadership of R. W. Fletcher,
furnished the music. A grand ball
was given in the evening which was
one of the big successes of the season.
It has not yet been announced
where the Farmers will hold their
next annual picnic, but it will prob
ably be either at Lexington or lone.
James Bannon, popular traveling
man who makes his headquarters in
Pendleton, has purchased a Saxon Six
motor car, which he will use In the
future in making his territory.
