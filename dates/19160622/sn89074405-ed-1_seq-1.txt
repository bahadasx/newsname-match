Dominion Likely to Have
New Governor General
This Fall,
Ottawa. Ont.. .lune- 22.—Canada will
nave a new governor general this
autumn Ifpreaent plans are carried
out. it is learned that the Duke of
Connaught will likely close his term
as Canadian viceroy some time in the
fall and that another member of the
aristocracy will come to Canada to
take his place. There Is a report that
Lord Curson of Kedleston, former
viceroy of India, will be his successor.
The Duke of Connaught had ar
ranged to leave Canada in September,
1914, a*id the Pel nee of Teck had
been announced as his successor. The
Duke and Duchess of Connaught,
with the Princess Patricia, had made
preparations for their departure for
England and the Prince of Teck was
about to sail from England when the
war broke out. The prince went to
the front with'the British forces and
is still there. The Duke, of Connaught
announced that he 'would continue in
Canada.
Bvents are so shaping themselves
that the Duke and Duchess of Con
naught see the way clear for their
departure from Canada, which has
been deferrsd for almost two years.
It Is not now believed that the Prince
of Teck will come, as it is said he
prefers to remain in active service.

couid be supported by a voter of hon
esty or intelligence, Lynn J. Frazier,
James Manahan and R. H. Grace,
who arrived in Grand Forks this aft

being warmly commended by Mr.
Manahan. Both Mr. Birdzell and Mr.
Grace made the trip from Fargo on
the special train.
Frarfer First Speaker.
lynn J. Frasier was the first speak
er of the afternoon. He strongly en
dorsed the program of the league for
the erection of terminal elevators,
packing pisnts, etc., declaring that
under the present conditions the price
of the farmers' products was fixed not
by. the law of supply and demand, but
by'gTaln gamblers in the Minneapolis
and Chicago wheat pits.
He denied that any pledges had
been signed by the league candidates
as to their course if elected, and paid
a high tribute to the character and
ability of A. C. Townley, president of
the Nonpartisan league, declaring
that Mr. Townley was a leader of "in
tegrity, ambition and foresight, and
abused only- by the politicians and
kept press of the state."
Minnesota System Flayed.
James Manahan of St. Paul was
the chief speaker of the session. He
said that In-his own state of Minne
sota, the state government had been
dictated for-the last 25 years by the
great corporations, for their own in
terests, and'against the interests of
the people
He spoke at some length of the
legal battle in that state between the
Equity Co-operative exchange and the
Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce,
claiming that the methods used by
the latter organization resulted in de
creasing to a great, extent the wealth
of the farmers of North Dakota-
He declared that it was agreed on
the part of the great interests of this
nation which was forcing the United
States into war with Mexico, and said
that if any of the members of the
.North Dakota national guard now
preparing to leave for the border lost
their lives the responsibility would
rest with the Standard Oil company
and other corporations.
Hosts Judiciary Candidates.
Mr. Manahan said that the laws
were the chief factors in the wealth of
the nation and state, and for that
reason, he urged the election of the
Nonpartisan candidates for the su
preme bench, in this connection he
denied that Either Grace. Birsell or
Robinson .had' Signed any pledge to

Secretary Has no Official Information to Give Him—*
Mexican Representative Says Seventeen
Americans Were Captured,
Naco, Ariz.. June 22.—One American soldier was kill
ed and three others injured when a half breed Mexican,
guarding the water works, opened fire upon members of
Co. E, 14th United States infantry, as guard was being
changed.
Washington, June 22.—Secretary Baker informed President Wilson
early today that there had been no report from (icneral Pershing on
the light between American and Cnrranxa soldiers near Carrizal yester
day, In which over a score of the American troops hw rvitorted killed
and twice that number captured. Secretary Baker went to the white
house with dispatches from General Kunston, giving such information
as has been Obtained from Mexican sources.
General Pershing's report, which Is expected momentarily, probably
will determine largely whether or not the Incident will precipitate im
mediate war.
If the re|ort declares that, the American Holdicrs were attacked
In apparent attempts to enforce Camoza'a demand that the United
States troop movements be only tow ards the northward border, it is
considered probable that the clash will be accepted by President. Wil
son as an act of war. Reports from Mexican sourics telling of the
clash, but not disclosing the American casualties, are accepted by the
officials as being fairly authentic, although none would believe the
Americans made the first attack.
If the clash represents an answer to the note, there is little donbt
that President AVilson will recommend that congress declare war
against Mexico.
A resolution authorizing President Wilson to drart national
guardsmen willing to take the federal oath immediately into the regu
lar army under the new army bill was submitted by Secretary Baker
to Chairman Hay, who said he would press for action tomorrow.
ARKEDOXDO ASKS FOR EXPLANATION.
Washington, June 22.—Eliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassador

sought an explanation of the reported occupation of Casas Grandes and
Neuvo Casas Grandes by General Pershing, saying thai such an act was
one of open hostility. -Secretary iAnsing had no official information on'
which.to discuss the CarrUal affair, and. according to report.*, Arre
