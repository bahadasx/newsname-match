GENERAL SUMMONS
All State Troops Ordered To
Duty.
Washington, June 18.-Virtual
ly the entire mobile strength of
the National Guard of all the
States and the District of Colum
bia was ordered mustered into
the federal service tonight by
President Wilson. About 100,
000 men are expected to respond
to the call. They will be mobi
lized immediately for such ser
vice on the Mexican border as
may later be assigned to them.
Gen. Funston. commanding the
border forces, will designate the
time and place for movement of
Guardsmen to the international
line as the occasion shall require.
In announcing the orders See
retary Baker said the State
forces would be employed only
to guard the border and that iio
additional troop movements into
Mexico were contemplated ex
cept in pursuit of raiders.
Guard call, Secretary Daniels
of the navy department ordered i
additional war vessels to Mexican
waters on both coasts to,,safe
guard American lives.
At the war, navy and state de
partments it was stated that no
new advices as to the situation
in Mexico had come to precipitate
the new orders.
Within the last two weeks,
however, tension has been in
creasing steadily.- The crisis
presented by Gen. Carranza's
note demanding the recall of
Gen. Pershing's expeditionary
force has been followed by a
virtual ultimatum served on the
American officer by Gen. Trevino,
the Mexican commander in Chi
huahua. To this was added yes
terday the possibility that Ameri
can and. Mexican troops had
clashed across the border from
San Benito, Texas.
Administration officials made
no attempt to conceal tonight
their relief over the safe return
of Maj. Anderson's cavalry
squadron to Brownsville afterI
their k ccessful bandit qhase.
SThe tr pee.-re . 4r. i
of bandits in the face of intima
II'tions that they would be attacked
1if they did' so. Gen. Funston
himself reported that he antici
pated fighting, presumably with
Carranza forces.
Mobilization of the National
Guardsmen to support Gen. Fun
ston's line will pave the way for
releasing some 30,000 regulars
for immediate service in Mexico
in the event of open hostilities
with the Carranza government.
The Guardsmen themselves c-ould
not be used beyond the line with
out authority of congress, and
unil they had volunteed for that
duty as they are called out under
the~old militia law. The new!
law, which would make them
available for any duty under_the
federal government goes into~
effect July 1.
The entire mobile regular army
in the United States. several pro
visional regiments o f regular
coast artillery, serving as infan
try, and the National Guard of
Texas, New Mexico and Arizona
now are on the border or in
Mexico. Definite figures have
never been made public, but it
Iis understood Gen. Funston has
about 40,000 regulars and pro
bably 5,000 or more guardsmen,
of whom 10,G00 regulars are with
Gen. Pershing or scattered along
his line of communications from,
Namiquipa, Mexico, to Columbus,
N. M.
General Call Sent.
Telegrams calling for the miii
tie. were sent tonight to the
governors of all States except
the three whose guardsmen all
ready have been mustered in,
after an all day conference at
the war department attended by
Secretary Baker, Maj. Gen.
Scott, chief of staff; Maj. Gen.
Bliss, chief of the mobile army,
and Brig. Gen. Mills, chief of
the militia divison, general staff.
Brig. Gen. McCombs, president
of the army war college also was
Iconsulted. since Mr. Baker did
not find it necessary to confer
again with President Wilson
after his visit to the White House
late last night, it was apparent
the decision to bring out the
militia was reached then.
eBy the new orders there will:
bplaced at Gen. Funston's dis
posal two major generals and 21
brigadier generals of militia with
Ktheir complete infantry com
mands. The entire infantry di
visions from New York and
Pennsylvania are called out as
are 15 full brigades from other
States. In all 88 regiments of
fantry, with 13 separate battal

State Militia Notes.
Members of the National Guard
who ne'lect or refuselto sign the
new oath of enlistm66t will be
required to remain under orders
of the military authities until
the expiration of thir present
terms of enlistment; according

Carolina, comprisiU4 at peace
strength 2,658 men, iv.tludes staff
and sanitary troops' two regi
ments of infantry, one troop of
cavalry, five companies of coast
artillery and five divisions of
naval militia. The -organization
is deficient in machine gun com
panies, there being none now in
service, but it is understood an
effort will be made to form one
in Columbia. At war strength,
of course,' the total would be
over the peace basis, the war
maximum being 150 men for
infantry companies, as against
a peace strength of about 75.
Will Attend Firemens Conven
tion.
The State Firemen's Associa
tion will meet in Orangeburg this
week Messrs. L.. Landecker
and John M. Smith represent
Winnsboro.
148 companies, eah of whic
must have a minimum strength
of 65 men when mustered into
the federal service.
The total enlisted force of in
fantry therefore would not be
less that 85,000 men.
Lesss than 500 companies,
scattered thoughout the country,
will not be mustered in and the
National Guard coast artillery
companies have not .rbeen sum
moned. All of the field artillery,
cavalry, engineers and signal
troops will be employed, as will
many of the militia field hospi
tals and ambulance companies.
The war department has on hand
ample equipment and clothing
to outfit and maintain this force.
The call applies to 79 batteries of
field artillery, 99 troops of caval
ry and one New York cavalry
machine gun troop, 25 engineer
companies and 29. signal com
panies, all with full equipment
already issued to.them. Twenty
six ambulance companies and 27
field hospitals also have been
ordered dmade ready for entrain
ment. .
No indication was given at the
state department tonight of the
course to be pursued with regard
to the reply to Gen. Carranza's
note demanding the withdrawal
of the Americati troops now in
Mexico. It -was prepared last
week by Secretary Lansing and
is still in President Wilson's
hands. It had been intended to
dispatch it to Mexico City to
morrow by special messenger
but recent d4velopments may
hange this plan.
CALL WAS ANTICIPATED
BY GOVERNOR MANNING
Columbia, S. C., June 18.
Ad. Gen. W. W. Moora stated
tonight that the two regiments
of infantry and one troop of
cavalry, with a maximum war
strength of approximately 3,800
offleers and men, would be mob
ilized at Styx Camp ground, near
Columbia within five days after
the order came, which is expect
ed late tonight. Already he has
notified regimental commanders
to instruct their various units to
be re.ly for the mobilization call.
The preliminary preparation
and permanent arrangement of
the camp at Styx will be in
charge of Major Drew, of Barn
well, chief of the quartermaster
department, who already is in
Columbia. Capt. J. M. Graham,
Nineteenth Infantry, U. S. A.,
will muster in the troops after
their arrival at the mobilization
grounds. Adjutant General
Moore will be in immediate
charge of the camp.
Anticipating the call, several
days ago Governor Manning is
sued an order instructing the
various units of the State militia
to be in readiness and each com
pany commander has issued com
plete instructions how to act In
case their commands were called
out. Little trouble is expected,
when the order is issued.
The full war strength of the
South Carolina guard is more
than 5,000 officers and men, con
sisting of two regiments of in
fantry, one troop of cavalry, five
companies of coast artillery and
four divisions of naval militia.
Governor Manning and Adju
tant General Moore remained on
duty untill after midnight to re
eceive the official. instructions to
mobilize the South Carolina mili
tia. The Governor's offlce was
kept open throughout the night
and he remained in touch with a
telephone at his side to. start the
machinery in motion which would
gather the militia at Camp Styx.
The Governor read the press dis
patches telling of the call by the
President for the militia for use
on the Mexican border and late
tonight dictated the following
statement to the people and, the
"I know that the Naona
Guard will gladly and willingly
respond to the call to aid in the
defense of American rights, I
American lives and American
honor. I feel certain those who
employ men who are members of
the militia will make satisfactory
arrangements whereby the men
can respond for service on the
border without injury to their
positions so that South Carolina
will sustain her enviable reputa
tion fo: patriotism and devotion
t'o duty. I know there will be
the best of co-operation between
the people and the National
Guard. South Carolina stands
ready to, furnish promptly her
quoto of men for service in this
Icrisis.''
Adjutant General More notifi
ed Col. E. M. Blythe of the first
Regiment, at Greenvillle; and
Col. H. B. Springs, of the Second
Regiment, at Georgetown, that
he was momentarily expecting
or ders from Washington and they
in turn notified all company com
manders to be ready to assemble
their men immediately. Late
tonight the Adjutant General tel
egraphed the militia bureau at
Washington as follows:
"The organized militia of South
Carolina. including the naval
militia, stand ready to answer
any call to duty within or with
out the States. The Guard is not
only willing but anxious to res
pond to the call of their country
in this crisis."
Colonel Springs, of the Second
Regiment, authorized Capt. E.
B. Cantey, of Columbia, to org
anize a machice gun company at
once to be attached to his regi
ment. Captain Cantey will be
gin receiving enlists tomorrow
morning at the office of the Adj.
General.
Capt. W. M. Carter, of the
Columbia cavalry troop, said if

Militia officers throughout the
State were in touch with the
Governor and Adjutant General
by telephone and telegraph and
they were all ready to gather
their commands and come to the
State mobilization grounds at

o'clock this morning no offcial
orders had been received to
mobilize the National guards of
this State.

For the first time since tf
War with Spain, 18 years ag<
the voice of the President of th

broadcast this morning, for, al
though a state of war does no1
exist between the United Siate
and Mexico, and those who an.
swer to the call may never b(
asked to make* the journey t(
the border, there is no assuranc(
that fighting of severe and pro.
tracted nature does not'lie ahead.
But the emergency will be faced.
Two years ago Great Britain,
which, like the United States, i
a non-military, peace-loving Na
tion, was stirred to its depths by
the appeal. "Your King and
Country Need You!" America
has no king. In this Republic
every citizen is a sovereign, and
hence the call of the country is
the call of this people to itself.
The news will create in the
ranks of the National Guard nc
excitement. The members have
expected such a call for months,
and have held themselves in a
state of readiness. . Every well
posted military man in the United
has known for four years that
oar relations with Mexico have
been poised on a hair-trigger.,
For weeks the attitude. of the
de facto head of Mexico the pom
sand
It has been marked by ilsolence
and by an utter failure to sym
pathize with the American point
of view or to rightly appraise the
benefits he could obtain from the
assistance this Government is
willing to give. After months
of investigation to determine
whether any one Of the so-called
Constitutionalist leader was able
o restore order in Mexica, the
Administration selected Carranza
s the one appeared best able to
emonstrate that this title was
2t mere sound. Villa himself
ad recognized him as hi's "first
hief," though he later turned
against him in revolt. The mo
ment this Government extended
recognition to Carranza, Villa's
ambitions were -doomed, and
none knew it better than he.
Behind the Carranza regime he
well knew would be put the in
fuence of the Colossus of the
North. In blind rage he begat
h i s revengeful outrages or
Americans in Mexico and in the
United States. Whether it was
also his hope to embroil the
United States and thus force the
overthrow of Carranza no one
knows except Villa and his inti
mates. But all the world knows
that when American troops
crossed the Mexican frontier it
pursuit of the Villaistas they
were at that moment virtualb~
allies of Carranza. All the worlc
knew it, that is, except Carranza.
Yet his acquiescence in theii
coming was forced and ungrac
ious, and not granted at all unti:
Washington had, in a carefully.
worded agreement, extended t<
him the reciprocal privilege 01
coming into the United States t<
ursue American bandits whc
had invaded Mexico and wer<

thorities. Since then he has bee!
increasingly resentful of the pre:
sence of American troops. anc
the ultimatum given by one oj
his generals that the American:
must not move south, or east, 0:
west, has made it appear tha
he is willing to back up his rasi
words with actions even more
rash.
Mexican sovereignty, Carranz;
would have us understand, it
jeopardized by the presence o:
an alien soldiery. That is the
battle-cry with which he rallie
his supporters. With a superfie

far more important that the ap
