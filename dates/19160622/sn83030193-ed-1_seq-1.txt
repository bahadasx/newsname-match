Mexican Reports of Yesterday's Bat
tle Show U. S. Troops Were Lured
by Flag of Truce; 12 Americans
Killed, 17 Captured; Mexican
Losses, 14 Dead, 30 Wounded.
WASHINGTON. June 22.-Ca!lcfs who saw
President Wilson to-day got the impression that he
is determined that if, despite all efforts to prevent
it, war with Mexico should come, the action of the
United States would be prompt and on a scale of
considerable magnitude.
It would not be a war of conquest, but Mr.
Wilson is said to be prepared to use the maximum
available military strength of the nation for a
short, decisive campaign to re-establish order and
a stable government in Mexico, as well as to per
manently insure protection of the American border
from outlaw forays.
There is no effort to conceal the anxiety caused
by the attack at Carrizal yesterday upon a detach
ment of the Tenth Cavalry, in which Mexicans
report 12 United States soldiers killed and 17 cap
tured, and their own losses at 14 killed and 30
wounded. No official report has been received from
Gen. Pershing, but it is realized that a courier
would have to ride sixty-five miles to carry news
of the engagement.
There is enough slmihrit .iinnnj; the border reports to convince
officials, that a serious clash occurred, whoever may have been the aggres
sor and whatever the outcome. It has brouqht war with Mexico so cloae
that officials say any hoiymay see the conffct in full swinp;.
