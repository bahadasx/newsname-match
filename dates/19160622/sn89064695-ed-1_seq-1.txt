SUBSCRIPTION: $1.50 PER YEAR IN ADVAHCL
The Right Of Nomination
Bill,
The Right of Nomination Bill
which is now pending before Con
gress to give Indians the right to
designate their own agents, will
probably be passed by Congress
before many more sessions if it is
not passed by the present Con
gress, if the humor of Congress,
as indicated by members of the
Indian committees, continues.
In the Senate, Senator Johnson
of South Dakota has espoused the
Indian cause with regard to the
Rjight of Nomination Bill, and is
giving it his special attention, and
insists that he is going to have the
bill passed if possible. Senators
Lane, Hustings Owen, Clapp,
LaFollette and Gronna also favor
the bill as indicated by them.
Senator Johnson introduced a
very long and elaborate bill rela
tive to giving Indians the right to
name their own agents and to have
a voice in their own .matters, but
thisrvi^as barely defeated in the
committee of the Senate by the
vote of Chairman Ashurst. But
the principal if not the only ob
jection to the Johnson bill was its
length, for the committee indicat
ed there should be a stronger bill
and one which would confine itself
to recalling Indian agents, and a
committee consisting of Senators
Clapp, Curtis and Lane was select
ed to draft another bill in lieu of
the Johnson bill.
In the House of Representa
tives, Representatives Stephens,
Carter and Hastings are strong
supporters of the Right of Nom
ination Bill, but all the members
of the Indian committee of the
House seem favorable to it ac
cording to their statements rat\de
at the meetings of the committee.
The Big Payment.
The principal topic of conversa
tion among the Chippewas is the
payment of one-fourth of the
Chippewa tribal funds that are
now in the United States Treasury
and which Congress appropriated
to be paid immediately.
About one million and a half
dollars will be paid to the Chippe
was of Minnesota probably during
this summer, and if the Indian
office fultills the intentions of
Congress the delay in the making
of the payment should not be
long.
The Indian office now has an op
portunity, or at least the present
federal administration, to make
itself popular by pacing out the
sum which Congress appropriated,
under the provisions of the Indian
appropriation act recently passed,
without any delay.
During the past year President
Wilson's attention has been called
to Chippewa matters and he has
caused the service to be improved,
and no doubt an appeal to him or
to Secretary Lane would cause an
early payment to be made,

meeting with Secretary Lane, the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs
and Inspector McLaughlin at the
secretary's office, last month, and
urged that a commission be sent
to Minnesota for the purpose of
making a roll of all those to whom
theiull amount of their shares of
the one-fourth of the tribal fund
which has been appropriated
should be paid without delay, and
the secretary stated that the Mc
Laughlin commission is so busy
elsewhere that it could not come
here immediately, but he intimat
ed that some steps would be taken
without delay.
Many questions have been asked
of the delegates who went to
Washington and spent several
months there,regarding the manner
in which the payment of one
fourth of the tribal fund is to be
made, but they have been unable
to gi^e any defiuate answer be
cause they were unable to learn
before they left Washington when
it would be made^
Benjamen Caswell An
Applicant For A Sup
ermtendency,
Recently Benjamen Caswell, a
member of the Chippewa bands,
made an application for a position
as a superintendent of one of the
reservations in this state, under
the amendment to the Indian ap
propriation act recently passed#
Congfesfi arhicu g*v$sthe Chippe
was the preference as employes in
the Chippewa Indian service in
this state, but he did not indicate
the reservation for which he de
sires an appointment.
In reply to his application Mr.
Ctswell was informed by the In
dian office at Washington, that
there is no vacancy at present to
which he could be appointed.
The refusal to appoint Mr. Cas
well to the position for which he
midean application is a direct
violation of the now existing law
as it specificially provides that
members of the Chippewa of Min
nesota bands shall be given the
preference to fill positions the
salaries of which are being paid
from Chippewa iribal funds.
The General Council should
make an issue regarding the ap
plications which have been or may
be made by Chippewas for posi
tions, and while Congress is still
in session refer the matter to the
Indian committees of Congress, or
appeal to the courts which have
jurisdiction to have the law en
forced.
It is true there are no vacancies,
but the law compels the Indian
office to make vacancies, if it is
not Indians who are holding the
positions, and appointing Indians
to fill them and we mean by In
dians Chippewas of Minnesota.
Many Sioux Visitors.
Many Sioux visitors from the
Sisseton and Yankton reserva
tions in South Dakota attended
the celebration here last week and
added immensely to the success of
the celebration.
Without the presence of the
Sioux at the annual celebration
here the Chippewas would be in- back preferring to remain
different to it, and for this reason
Congress should be appealed to jeral years ago she
for an appropriation to be devoted
entirely to the expenses of the
Sioux during the celebrations here
after.

to the friends and supporters of
Ira B. Mills and A. G. Anderson.
The vote was in pare as follows:

An Incident Of The Chip
pewa-Sioux War.
As is well known the Chippe
was and Sioux were at war with
each other until after 1870, and
that this war bad been kept up
for more than two centuries with
out cessation.
During the war it frequently
happened that children and some
times women were taken as prison
ers by both sides, and adopted into
the tribe which took them prison
ers.
During the celebration here last
week a half-blood Sioux and Chip
pewa was here from the Yankton
Sioux reservation in South Dako
ta. The English name of this
man is Andrew War, and he is the
grandson of a full blood Mille Lac
Chippewa Indian woman who was
captured in 1839, near Stillwater,
by a party of Sioux after her par
ents had been killed by the party.
While the Sioux were firing up
on the Chippewa family two of
the members of the family, both
boys, namely: Nay turn ub-ence
and Wah-be-gauge, escaped and
reached Mille Lac. Nay-tum-ub
ence removed from Mille Lac in
the early seventies, and died here
about twenty-five years ago or
more.
The youngest member of the
family, that was attacked by the
Sioux party referred to, was a
little girl two or three years of
age, and she was the grandmother
of Andrew War. After she had
grown to womanhood she was
given the privilege of returning to
her people, the Mille Lac Chippe
was, but she declined to come
with
the Sioux. Before her death sev
told Mr. War
who his people were on her side,
and the latter found many rela
tives here amoDg which are Ben
and Steve Caswell.

Years Gone By.
The Pioneer Press of last Sun
day contains a very interesting ac
count of incidents of the past in
this state written by Col. P. F.
Harvey, U. S. A., a portion of
which relates to the Chippewas
and the Sioux and is as follows:
"As illustrating a phase of life as
seen at Fort Snelling sixty five
years ago, I cite the following in
cident condensed from Neill's His
tory of Minnesota: Alex Ramsey,
who then occupied the guberna
torial chair, found it necessary to
call a council between the Sioux
add Chippewa nations in order to
reach some terms of accommoda-

to please.

stables, so as to form a separation
between the Chippewas in their
rear and the advancing band of
Sioux numbering perhaps 300, a
large portion on horseback, armed
and painted. But they were only
showing off, having, in fact, all
due respect for those ugly cast
iron orators of Uncle Sam.
Among the Sioux appeared the
young Pillager chief, Sitting in a
row, standing six a half feet in his
moccasins, and weighing 220
pounds. The Sioux soon fell back
and formed a line, discharging
their pieces in a scattering fire as
they did eo The Chippewrs re

to the frequent wars that they
waged against each other. Fort
Snelhng was designated as the
meeting, where the presence of
troops and cannon would serve to
prevent any hostile demonstra
tion among the savages.
The council was held in June,
1850, under the walls of the fort.
The Chippewas arrived early in
the day, and appeared to regard
the occasion as one of fun and
merrymaking. The Sioux made
their appearance later, and rapidly
