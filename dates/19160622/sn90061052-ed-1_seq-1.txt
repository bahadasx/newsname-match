HAYZLETT FOR TREASURER
Jaspers Mayor Seeks Democrat
ic Nomination
Some liftcen years ago a citizen of
the town of Jasper got his name on the
county ticket as a candldato for treasur
er and but for that one exception Jns
per has never had a name on the Re
publican or Democratic tickets When
Chas L Haylctt filed for county
treasurer the other day and announced
his determination to make an active
canvas for the Democratic nomination
Jasper Democrats immediately ap
proved his course and pledged him their
support
Charley Ilayzlett spent his boyhood
and young manhood on a farm in Lin
coln Township He began to serve the
Democratic party as township commit
teeman before he left the farm and since
coming to Jasper he has served in the
same capacity in this township for sev
eral years past He came to Jasper 11
years ago and during nearly all that
time he has been engaged in the grain
business here making an enviable rec
ord as a business man and represent
ing the Brand Dunwoody milling inter
ests and the Waters Pierce and Wilhoit
oil companies In civic affairs he has
always been active in the Interest of
town and community He served the
city several years as councilman and is
now holding the offices of mayor pres
ident of school board and president of
the Jasper Commercial Club He was
city treasurer of Jasper four years and
conducted that office to the satisfaction
of the community
Mr Hayletts wide accquaintance
among the farmers of this section of the
county would make his name a help
ful asset to the Democratic ticket and
in his selection Democrats may know
that they have named a man whose
business experience and Integrity fit
him for the office he seeks
Local Guardsmen Hurry to Camp
The call of the President for the mo
bilization of the National Guards was
responded to from nearly every town in
Missouri Jasper had one Glenn
Holmes private in Company C Second
Missouri Infantry and he left Monday
night for Neuida where the Second
Missouri is mobilizing
Lieut Karl 1 loo ten of Company C
whose home is in Lamar was In Jasper
Monday looking for recruits
It is likely that the National Guards
men sent to the Mexican border and
forts at other points will be used to re
lieve the regular soldiers at these poinls
and that the regulars will do the light
ing It is the belief that the Regular
Army can hunille the situation but the
Government desires to be in u position
to act decisively when it becomes nec
essary to fight and wants as strong a
a force as possible ready for business
The Guards in mobiliation at Ne
vada will probably beheld there a week
or two where they will be drilled and
conditioned so that they will be at least
partially prepared for the work before
them
Notice to Farmers
Hemember I still write Insurance up
on Grain in Stuck Bin or Klevator
Your Mutual will not carry this risk
My rates on wheat in stacks are ery
reasonable 10 L Crawford
