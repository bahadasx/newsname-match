Stirrinsr scenes at the armory, on
the streets along the line of march,
marked the departure of three com
panies of Coaist Artillery and a medi
cal corps and band from ( Bridgeport
this morning.
Many fond adieus were given the
departing troops at the railroad sta
'tionby sweethearts, wives and moth
ers as ' the khaki -clad soldiery clam
' tiered aboard the special train at 9:20
for the journey, to Fort Wright.
( Though orders indicated that 10
days practice is to be held the pre
vailing opinion today among the
troops and general public Is that the
period .will be extended v indefinitely
with a possibility of the local com
panies being called to the front to
man such big guns as might be em-
' placed on the Mexican border line as
frontier defense. .-.
- It is estimated that fully 1,000 rela
tives and friends of -the 143 officers
and men who left here today under
command of Lieutenant Colonel Vin
cent M. King, gathered at the rail-
" road station to honor the defensive
forces. Many affecting scenes were
witnessed, when gray-haired fathers
and mothers kissed their sons, hus
bands in uniform pressed babies to.
their breasts, while wives held the
short but heavy Sprfngflelds of the

The local companies were called to

assembly was sounded at 8 o'clock
sharp. It was brisk and snappy work
of getting prepared for the journey.
Full marching equipment was required
consisting of guns, ammunition, blan
kets, shelter tents and the necessary
eating and Intrenching tools. Inspec

Was immediately made and the men
found to have been particularly care
ful. - ' - . ' -
The battalion was formed in col
umns and the order to march given at
exactly 8:30. Headed by the Coast

down Main to State to Courtland to

' the viaduct to the east platform of

At the armory many interested spec
!" tators were held back with difficulty by
one lone policeman. Along th line of
v march, the olive drab uniforms were
greeted with cheers and flags flew or
were' waved from the buildings and
windows. Cheering was frequent and
many calls of "Good Luck" were
heard. Throngs gathered on the side,

"Washington, June 22- A resolution
authorizing the President to draft
national guardsmen willing to take the
federal oath immediately into the reg
ularly . army, under the terms of the
new army bill was submitted by
Secretary Baker to Chairman Hay, of
the House military committee. Mr.

for action.
If possible, Mr Hay said, he would
obtain consideration of the measure
I y unanimous consent but he was pre
pared to ask for a special rule If
necessary. The resolution differs
slightly i from the provision of the
measure originally prepared for bring
ing the national guard i into federal
service in that it would provide for
rervice "during the period of the emer

war." - -
Members of the active guard of the,

the District of Columbia, who take the
new -roath would be subject to draft

STRATFORD AVE. BRIDGE WILL BE
MONUMENT TO NON-UNION LABOR;
JOINT BUILDING TRADES MAY AGT
Though every effort has been made
to have the present administration
recognize union labor, the Stratford
avenue bridge promises to become a
colossal monument to non-union la
bor, according to members of the
Bridgeport Building Trades council.
With nearly all the piers raised
above the waterline, with the excep
tion of a few "eandhogs," as com
pressed air workers are known, not a
union . tradesman has been employed
in the work of carpentry, caulking,
masonry, steamfitting, hoisting or iron-
working, labor leaders declare. The
reason ascribed for the introduction
of union . "sandhogs" is the fact that
that there is none not affiliated with
unions.
Members of the Building Trades
council assert that Holbrook, Cabot &
Rollins, officials here, issue the geneiai
challenge: "If you can fprce us to
unionize the Stratford avenue bridge
work, all right." They also take ref
uge, it is asserted, in a technical quib
ble that the "Holbrook" division of
the contracting firm of New Tork city,
where strictly union men are. em
ployed, is willing to employ union
men here but that the "Rollins" di
vision, which is of Boston, superin
tending the work here, refuse to do so.
In contrast to the attitude of the
Stratford avenue bridge builders
agreements have been made with the

William Parsons, Bank Tell
er, Divorces Blanche' f
Teeter of New York.
FATHER LEARNED SHE
HAD TWO HUSBANDS
Breaks Down Woman's
Story That She Had Ob
tained Separation.
William C. Parsons, a teller at the
-Cty National bank, was granted an
annulment of marriage' from. Blanche
Parsons of New York, by Judge "Webb
in the superior court this afternoon
after the young man had explained
that when he married the defendant
she already had a husband living. Par
sons is 23 years old and the de
fendant 24.
Parsons had known the girl, whose
maiden name was Blanche Teeter, for
several M years prior to their mar
riage last November. She told him
she had been married to Joseph Hines
of New York, but had obtained a di
vorce. Parsons believed the , girl's
story and they were quietly , married
at the city hall by former Assistant
City Clerk Frank Braithwaite, No
vember 20 last.
Right after the ceremony the young
bridegroom telephoned to his father,
F. E.. Parsons, secretary and treasurer
of the B. D. Pierce, Jr., Co. The
father was surprised but told the
young couple to come to his home.
The elder Parsons questioned the"glrl
and found that she had no record of
her divor3 from Hines. It was then
discovered that she brought proceed
ings against Hines in a domestic rela
tions court in New York, tut had no
divorce decree.
The young couple had never lived
together after a conference with At
torney Jacob B. Klein representing the
husband. It was determined to bring
annulment proceedings. The young
brid-e went to live in New York after
the separation.
U. S. Munitions

Ready For Service
San Antonio, June ' 22. Vast quanti
ties of ammunition and supplies are
already in storage in Mexico aitd at
points along the border for use of
American troops, a high army officer
of General Funston's headquarters de
clared today. When the army first
went to the border it did not have a
motor truck; now there are more than
500 in use and they are used to move
troops" from place to place as well as
supplies. Entire regiments can be
moved more rapidly than cavalry.

As a result of -What labor here terms
flagrant defiance of equitable princi

practices, and the inability of Frank
A. Fitzgerald, state business agent of
the Hoisting Engineers of America, in
, whom the powers of tentative negotia
tions were also placed by the masons,
steamfitters and ship carpenters to
procure even promise of consideration,
it is likely that joint action will now
be taken by the trades here.
Business Agent Fitzgerald, when in
Bridgeport yesterday, reluctantly dis
closed the situation. Asked why the
administration had not been appealed
to he said:
"Bridgeport has an eight hour day
for municipal employes hut has neg
lected legislation that would compel
contractors working on municipal .con
tracts to observe the same hours with
union wages. Nevertheless the ad
ministration should have seen to it
that the Stratford avenue work was
made union. As they have not done
so, Holbrook, Cabot & Rollins merely
laugh at our efforts and say, 'If you
can force us to unionize, all right.' "
Agents of the Building Trades coun
cil say they have ascertained that in
New Xork the firm use union labor
but In Boston and elsewhere in New
England do not do so.

ter's Athens correspondent. Ho ca
bled that M. Zaimis, to whom the for
mation of a new cabinet is said to
lhave been entrusted, went to' the
French legation during a conference
there of entente ministers last even
ing and announced in the name of
King Constantino that Greece had
yielded.

ers was delivered to the Greek gov
ernment at noon on Wednesday.

in government circles that it would
be an impossibility to accede to the

News Kept From Public
The action of the entente powers
came during one of the hottest days
in Greece. The palace was darkened,
the King was at Chateau Tatoy, shops
were closed and the ministries were
deserted when the blow fell. The peo
ple were unaware what had occurred
until well on towards evening, when
newspapers and handbills, distributed
broadcast, made known the text of
the demands.
Meanwhile King Constantine went
hastily to Athens. The troops in the
city were ordered under arms. The
deputies were summoned to the
chamber where Premier Skouloudis
announced that he had resigned. The
chamber adjourned immediately,

left the building.

by Elizeo Arredondo, the Mexican am

Official Mexican despatches were ue,

that the Mexican forces thought the
American troops, who approached Car

Arredondo said he called Secretary
Lansing's attention to the distance
traversed by the American troops
from their base and to what he called
the "Imprudence of the American com
