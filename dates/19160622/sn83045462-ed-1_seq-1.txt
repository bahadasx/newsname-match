President Wilson will sit tight

troops of the de facto governmen
in which he has full confidence.
That was all the information th
clay as to the new crisis in Mexico
been expected by those in touch
bi Mexico.

officers acting upon their own inil
steps on the part of the administra
Will Satisfy South America.
The President's policy of patience
will be carried to the extreme limit,
so that all South America and the
world may understand that the United
States did not seek or wish war with
Mexico, and was compelled to enter j
this condition because of attacks from
Mexicans themselves.
It is not to be understood that the
President will permit soldiers of this
country to be placed in jeopardy conti
nousVy through alleged misunderstandings,
as the men have been told
to take care of themselves and do the
job well, but he does want to satisfy
himself as to whether the attacks upon
this government's soldiers are from orders
from Gen. Carranza and his military
advisers. Once determined to his
own satisfaction that the fault is not
with troops of the United States, but is
unquestionably with Mexicans, acting
upon orders from th* highest authorities,
the President will speedily act and
war will be on.
War May Precede Declaration.
The President will not go to Congress j
suggesting a declaration of war upon j
Mexico until the very last minute, j
Actual war may begin long before j
Congress is communicated with on the
subject, but when the President does ;
ake the matter to Congress he wants j
be able to advise that body that J
rs of this country sent into Mex- j
:<> punish bandits, have been at- j
"i "r?y troops of the Mexican gov-,
lent acting on orders from the
iog Mexican government. That
put the onus of war on the Mex*
nd not on this country.
T -re was not the least excitement
?*ind the White House during the
day. The President worked in his offices
from 10 o'clock until 1 o'clock,
when he went to luncheon. Secretary
Baker of the War Department had
seen the President at 9 o'clock, presenting
dispatches and receiving instructions.
but he did not call after
that. The President's callers were senators.
representatives and others, all
on different missions.
Grim Purpose Is Evident.
A stir of grim purpose was evident
about the State, War and Navy departments
today, while the government
awaited official reports from United
States Army officers on and below, the
Mexican border, concerning news dispatches
of last night and today which
said that Carranza troops had killed,
wounded and taken prisoner a large
number of American soldiers in a battle
near Carrizal, Mex.
One o! the flrBt things (lone was tne j
presentation by Secretary of War Baker
to Chairman Hay of the House military
affairs committee, after consultations
with President Wilson and Secretary of
State Lansing. of a resolution authorizing
the President to draft National
Guardsmen willing to take the federal
oath into the regular army immediately.
If possible. Mr. Hay said, he would obtain
consideration of the resolution by
unanimous consent, but he said he was
prepared to ask for a special rule to
handle the resolution in the House if j
necessary. The resolution differs slightly j
frtrn the provisions of the measure orgtnally
prepared for bringing the National
Guard into the federal service, in that it t
provides for service "during the period of J
the emergency."
Mexico Enters a Protest.
Eliseo Arredondo, ambassador designate
of the de facto government of
Mexico, sought an engagement to see
Secretary lj^nsing. and presented a
communication from the Mexican minister
of foreign affairs, asking the
meaning of what his government considers
warlike moves of the United
fc'tates. Secretary Lansing told hirn he
iiad no official information on which to
discuss the Carrizal affair, and, according
to Mr. Arredondo. he also was without
knowledge of whether any Mexican
towns had actually been occupied, notwithstanding
news dispatches today
that Gen. Pershing has occupied the j
/.urn* of ('* it a CrnnHi>ii and Vnovo Pa?o '
Grandee in Mexico.
Mr. Arredondo Maid that he called
Secretary .Lansing's attention to the
distance traversed from their base by
the American troops, in view of the
f.tct that they were at Carrizal. and

near Villa Ahumuda, Chihuahua, u

about 200 men, and a force of our gov- u

"According to the statement made by ^

the encounter.
"Please make proper representations m
to the department and say to the Sec- P1

Ciudad Juarez, and rather far from the ?

Mr. Arredondo was with Secretady ?
Lansing twelve minutes. He said his w
dispatches showed that a number of
dead were left on the field of the encounter,
and stated positively that the ?*i
Mexican forces had taken seventeen v
American troopers prisoner. ?
Mr. Lansing was uncommunicative as P
to what he had told Mr. Arredondo. and ??
was equally silent as to his conferences 11
with the Secretary of War.
"I suppose." he said, "I shall be con- I

tEPEAL LAW OF 1909 THAT
RESTRICTS D. C. ESTIMATES
'rovide by law for Handling D. C.
Surpluses or Deficits and for Preventing
an Excessive Surplus.
BY THEODORE W. NOYES.
Editorial Correspondence of The Star.
The argument against the half-andalf
law has been condensed as follows:
l doubling of the local tax revenue
nder the half-and-half arrangement
as come to produce an amount far in
xcess of the sum which can be wisely
nd economically expended in capital
laintenance and upbuilding. This exess
of available revenue should be preented
by reducing or eliminating the
ational contribution and not by dereasing
the local taxation, since Washngton
is now grossly underassessed
nd is already the lightest taxed among
.merican cities.
The evidence before the joint conressional
committee and the conclusive
ndings of that committee dispose of
he charge that Washingtonians are
nderassessed and undertaxed.
Washington replies to the other conention
as follows: The amount raised
nnually under the half-and-half arangement
in the past has seldom,
r ever, heen more than enough and
as often been insufficient to meet the
Hpitars needs in current maintenance
nd in judicious upbuilding through
reat permanent public improvements,
luch more than this amount could be
risely and economically expended toay
upon the capital in accordance with

The apparent aurpluaea of Dlatriet

lona are artiflelal. not genuine. I
The Dlatiict taxea have, by eon- I
reaaional preaaure on the aaaeaaor and

iquor licenxex. Estimates
Do Not Show Full Needs.
Since 1909 the estimates submitted
y the Commissioners no longer repre- ^
erit the full needs of the District,
'he law enacted in that year forbids
hem to follow their previous practice -7
i accordance with the letter and spirit
f the organic act of informing Conrcss
with reasonable^fullness of the
tunicipal needs and of leaving it to *
ongress to select from alternative c
ropositions of needed improvements
lie items aggregating the amount of g
ppropriations which it was willing to
?ake. If this amount was less than
ouble the local tax revenue a surplus 1
i favor of the District went over for
s benefit to subserfhent years. If the t
ppropriated amount was more than
ouble the local revenue, the United j
tates advanced to the District as a
smporary loan, with interest, the ]
mount of this deficit. By this sys5m
Congress was fully informed as x
> the needs of the District and used 1
s judgment in selecting those which
> that year the District and the *
nited States could jointly afford to
iTfsfy. A rough account was kept j J
etween the District and me i nited
tates which gave some flexibility to q
le appropriations. Any lack of equity
i the adjustment of the account was .
jvariably to the disadvantage of the e
istrict, since it always repaid with t
iterest the advances which repre- '
fitted its debits, and since it sometimes
tiled to have its c redits, its tax sur- (
luses over half of the appropriations,
iter used for its full benefit on the ?
alf-and-half basis. When the nalonal
partner made an advance to the
>cal partner the amount was always
epaid with interest. When the l,ocal v
artner made an advance to the naional
partner no interest was paid on t
he loan, and sometimes th$ principal
as not repaid in full. The arrangelent
was. on the whole, wise and bene- c
cial, notwithstanding these occasional t
linor inequities suffered by the Disrict.
c
By act of March 3, 1909, 35 Stat., 728,
he Commissioners are required not, to
ubmit estimates in excess of twice the
stimated revenue of the District for
he fiscal year to be provided for. after
aking into consideration all charges 1
gainst said revenues in other than the t
district bill. i
This unvyise law prevents the Com- f
nissioners from suggesting to Congress
any alternative methods of ex- <
ending the District revenues and con- a
ines them to a single line of proposals .
within the limits of the probable revnues.
The result follows that if Con- c
i-iiuu /llujinnpftVffs ?nv HiicrarPHtArl t
endilure there remains* an unexpended
urplus of District revenue, unless
Congress substitutes some other wise
xpenditure in its place. If Congress
loes not substitute some better method
f spending this revenue than that
proposed by the Commissioners and
ejected by Congress, the District's
egislature is blamable. The reasoning
yhich treats this failure of Congress
o select from the many municipal
eeds of the District sufficient to aborb
the available revenues as proof
f the absence of such needs and of an

More than 2.000 Washingtor

ndustrial life of the capital, an
veil and happy today in th<
nobilization camp near For

Tomorrow these men will bi
nustered into the governmen!
;ervice as regular army troops
tnd then probably from 5 to ic
>er cent of them will be returnee
o their families. That is tht
>ercentage that Brig. Gen. Wil
iam E. Harvey estimates will fai
0 qualify under the strict age anc
nedical tests. That means thai
>robably 150 of the boys now ir
amp will be back home withir
1 couple of days. The rest art
ikely to be in the camp for sev
ral months, if they are not soor
ient to tne Mexican Doraer.
Officers of the camp today say thej
vould not be surprised to get orders
o send certain portions of their comnand
to the border any day, -but th?
amp administration is being based or
he supposition that they will all be ir

It is definitely settled that the musterng

Gen. Harvey ?roud of Men.

> made an early inspection of the camp
I this morning, and upon his return to
' the brigade headquarters said:
"I am pleased with what has already
been done in camp. It is being rapidly
"put Into service shape. The men are in
, fine condition and happy. Officers of Qj
the regular army have made the rounds
and have complimented the District
troops on the excellent way in which
they have adapted themselves to an unfortunate
field condition. The heavy
storm last night, coming upon this softclay
ground, made the camp a very disagreeable
place for service, but we are Si
getting it drained off and oefore night
I I am sure we will all be proud of it.
"I am proud now of the caliber of
men that are in the service here. It
, is truly representative of the citizen- 7)I
ship of the District, and will stand up
as well as any similar organization
from other states. We will be ready
for service when called upon."
Gen. Hugh L. Scott, chief of stafT of
the army, visited the camp last evening
and congratulated the officers on
the way they had weathered the storm.
1 Recruiting: On at Camp. ?0
f In addition to the recruitings stations

^ and desire to see service on .the border in:
will be welcomed by the officers here. ?
i A wide-open recruiting station is be- *
ing maintained right in the camp, and txi
t the man will have the right to pick
any organization >vhich he might
wish to serve in. CO
I The recruiting campaign will be
pushed with all vigor possible from ~
t that end. Officers here have no doubt
i but what the necessary number of men ot
' will be available before the call comes
)' for service on the border. At the rate
'at which the men came in during the f~i>
I first two days of the preparations for nr
the mobilization, enough men will soon
i be obtained to fill all of the organi- f
zations up to full war strength, with ,
. possibly some left over for reserve. nr
To fill all of the organizations up to "
1 full war strength Maj. Harry Coope, an
adjutant general, this morning esti|
mated that it would take 900 to 1,000
1 additional men. This would allow for
the 10 per cent of rejections on account K
t of the physical requirements of the
regular mustering officer. It is hoped ^oiI
1 that these men will b% obtained in a bui
short time. gi^

_ were filled up and a few other sanitary ip^,
arrangements completed there was an cor

Then some of the companies were zaj
taken out on the road skirting the by
Arlington cemetery wall and put q0,
through foot movements. This was <jr(
without the heavy pack equipment, pe
which they lugged into camp with them otj.
yesterday. fac
The men will be drilled as they have
probably never kn^wn before. Under
Sergts. Garner and Simmons, both of of

insisted upon, and a man will not be the

Juarez, the Mexican town across the

half evacuated at 10 o'ciock today Dy
the Carranza garrison. It was officially
reported that three trainloads of
soldiers had gone southward during
the early morning, and that three more
trains had been loaded in preparation
for departure.
Officials 01 the Mexico Northwestern
railroad reported at 9:30 a.m. that two
additional trains had been loaded with
troops of the Juarez garrison and were ,
all ready to steam southward on re- j
ceipt of orders.
Notwithstanding the preparations for
departure, soldiers remained on guard
at the customs gate and Gen. Gonzales'
headquarters, while a few roamed the
streets.
American army officials expressed the
opinion that evacuation would be com- j
pleted during the day, until the Mexi- I
cans were beyond the range of the
American artillery. Gen. Bell instead
of going to For Bliss remained downi

a sixty-pound explosive six miles,
pointed their noses threateningly over

arising from the battle at Carrizal
were awaited.
Guns Trained on Juarez.
Stationed at Golden Hill, at an elevation

iominate any movement that may be
made by Carranza forces. Down along
trie river macnine gun companies irom
Sen. Bell's command were ready% to
take their position at advantageous
points, while at remote stations the
remainder of his men awaited orders.
With every precaution taken, how5ver,
for the protection of the city,
iope continued to be expressed that
tension might abate. No shot will be
Ired from this side of the international
boundary unless hostile action is initiated
on the other side.
The Mexican officials here and in
Juarez expressed the opinion that, the
ight at Carrizal should be# regarded as
i detached incident, without effect on
the general situation. Inasmuch as
they had been in communication with
VIexico City during the night observers
thought it possible that this might be
the view of Gen. Carranza and his advisers.
Night Preparation for Evacuation.
Reports to Gen. George Bell, jr.,

tastily loaded into freight cars. Capt.

source that the evacuation was
ilready under way and that one train .

Throughout the night the streets in

the battle became public, but thoro
were no demonstrations.
Mexicans apparently confined themselves
to speculation as to the consequences.
Heavy patrols were thrown
into the streets with instructions to put
down any disorders.
At Gen. Gomez's headquarters a victory
for Mexico was being: claimed.
The scene ip the front room of the
comandancia where the younger officers
were gathered was holiday-like.
Several of them, speaking of the battle,
said "We won." They remained composed,
however, and made little other
reference to the incident:
Received the News Quietly.
Juarez first learned of the fight In a
vague form in the early afternoon. The
civilian population then be^an to pack
their household goods.
Many already had left for interior
points by a morning train in anticipation
of the trouble. Others crossed to
El Paso later in the day.
A curious scene wa'; a procession of
civilians carrying arms. In age they
ranged from small boys, not as tall as

!them were in the ragged dress of the
peon, but some belonged to the better
class.
| Warlike activity was first noticed at
[the railway yard, where a string of
freight cars lay coupled to several day
coaches that bore the name of the army
corps of the north. A number of men
were employed there in stowing sacks
of beans and flour, forage and other
army supplies. Late in the afternoon a
rather large body of Mexican cavalry
passed through the town toward the
hills. Many wagons filled with women
and children were bound also in that
direction.
No Americans Molested.
. No instance of any attempt to molest
anty American was reported during the
daytime. After dark no American is
believed to Ilave remained in Juarez.
"This shows how dangerous it is to
bring American and Mexican troops in
contact," said Mexican Consul Garcia
last night. "But it need not lead to war.
It may be treated as a regrettable incident.
I am still optimistic."
Consul Garcia said he would spend
the night in Juarez, explaining that he
might do more good there than on the
American side.
"You can deny," he added, "that I am
going to close^the consulate in El Paso,
for I have received no such orders."
Although the street car service from
El Paso to Juarez has been frequently
stopped at night when trouble looked
imminent, as three nights ago. the traffic
continued as usual last evening.
At the international bridges there
was no sign of excitement.
Consul Garcia said that a message
from Mexico City had been received
which stated that the rebels in the
states of Zacatecas and Coahuila had
given up their fight and joined the Carranza
government.
Anxiety at Funston's Headquarters.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., June 22.?Gen.
Funston's headquarters reflected early
today the unrelieved strain in the
American-Mexican situation.
The night had passed without news
from Gen. Pershing, and army officers
here professed to see a remaining
chance that war might be averted, although
unwilling to believe that the
commander of the American form? that
battled yesterday with Gen. Trevinos
men at Carrizal had been the aggressor.
Frank skepticism was aroused by the
suggestion that Gen. Gomez might not
have been attempting to enforce Carranza
edict by force, and it was pointed
out that his determination to force the
Americans back to their own line was
indicated by the official admission that
he had sent a messenger to the American
commander advising him to with*
draw.
Gen. Funston spen the nigh in efTorts
to learn more details of what occurred
at Carrizal, but in conformity
with the known attitude of the administration
not to precipitate war without or- f
iers or sufficient cause, he remained
steadfast In his determination not to
authorise moves that would dissipate all
ioubt as to the American army's future
relations with that of Carransa.
