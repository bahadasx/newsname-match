2240 VOTES CAST AT
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY
Tho Democrats held their prlmnry
Saturday and polled tho largest vote
ever polled in Quay county, even with
tho republicans were voting. A large
vote Saturday was that for assessor
when tho three candidato received
2182 votos; candidates for commls
ceived 2175; candidates for commis
sioners from tho several districts were
1st, 2132; 2nd, 2139; 3rd 2170. This
vote shows an increase of more than
1000 votes over flvo years ago when
Saxon for district attorney received
the largest voto of any democrat on
tho ticket, which was 1102.
The polls opened at eight o'clock
and the voter began to cast their bal
lots for their favorites. Each candi
date was here in person or had some
special representative to ask tho vo
ters to support their favorite. Tho
buzz-wagons were busy bringing in
those who did not have time to come
otherwise, so it is plain that overy
available voto was polled that could
possibly bo urged to get out.
There wore a number of farmers
here from all purLi of tho county, nnd
some of them were working for their
favorite candidate. It may hnvo done
some good but from the returns it
looks liko their men would have gain
ed more votes if they had stayed at
homo and worked among the neigh
bors. Tucumcarl polled nearly 700
votes. This was perhaps because so
many farmers were allowed to come
hero and vote. Somo of the Repub
licans did not vote und a number of
the socialists did not voto.
Sands-Dorsey Drug Co. displayed a
large bulletin containing tho votes for
the several candidates. This board
was the feature of the ovening. At
first some of tho candidates thought
they wero elected by big majorities
but when other districts commenced
to lower their lead silenco prevailed

and few enndidntes were sure of their
nomination until after midnight when
most everything of importance hnd ar
rived and been totaled.
Tho race for sheriff was perhaps the
hardest fought of any, and thero were
2210 votes cast for the three candi
dates, nearly 100 more than either of
the other olHccs.
The race for senator was another
spirited race and it was anybody'
until tho last box arrived Wednesday
night, when it was a.-cci'taincd thai
Albert Calisch of Montoyn, had won
over J. II. Welch of Forrest by the
small plurality of 20 voles. Holh of
these men were well liked in their
homo community. In Montoyn where
Mr. Calisch lives tho voto stood 110 to
3 in his favor. In Format whoro Mr.
Welch lives ho secured 138 votes to
Mr. Cnlisch's 3. In Tucumcarl Mr.
Calisch carried the town by a voto oT
370 to 237, or a lend of 139 votes.
Thos. N. Lawson led the ticket by
securing 1301 votes against two good
men. This was a surprise to tho pol
iticians because Mr. Lawson did most
of his campaigning alone and cover
ed nearly ever nook and corner. Hf
is one of the finest young men in our
county and this is another thing that
gave him many supporters.
J. C. Williams won the nomination
for prol ate judge by a good majority
and from hearsay il is understood that
tho republicans will not try to defeat
him for this ofilce.
The three commissioners chosen in
this election were all cuttle men, but
hnvo made a success with their own
business and should made splendid
commissioners.
Ono thing nnticnblo was that the
plains country was divided against
itself. Tho west voted against the
east and the east against the west.
Only one man succeeded in winning

cls, who was conceded to have the
nomination in his pocket when ho an
nounced. Roth of his opponents be
ing from Tucumcarl gavo him nnothc
favorable advantage. He won ovor
Snm Dinmukes by a vote of 1055 to
091, a lead of 304.
While tho primary wnB spirited and
perhaps somo stories circulated that
will not sot well when the truth ir
known It is thought most of the ticket
will hnvo, practically no opposition thin
fall because a strong effort will be
rot-do by the democrats to elect Wood
row Wilson and n democratic stoU
ticket and cannot ufford to tight itr
county candidates. Future develop
ments will prove whether the repub
licans stand nny ehanco to slip one o:
two candidates over this year.

FRIDAY OF
LAST WEEK AT QUAY
An escaped convict from tho State
penitentiary was arrested by Quay
county officials and brought to Tucum
carl and placed in jnil. Ilert Shipmnn
was the man nnd he was serving n
short Kcntcnce for forgery, being sent
up from Kan Miguel county.
He was located near Quay, working
with a toad gang. Ho had been a
trusty since being placed in the pen,
and was considered one of the best
bird of the gang, but ono day ho enme
up missing and not until ho was bus
picioncd and captured did tho state
authorities know of his whereabouts.
Shipmnn will be taken bnck to San
ta Fe and put in confinement. The
liberties lie formerly enjoyed will be
cut ofT from him nnd ho will bo just
a common jail bird.
SOMETHING DOING FRIDAY
The blood hounds have come and
gono nnd the county officers nro si
lent as to what they accomplished.
A few days ago in the neighborhood
of the blue water holes three miles of
barbed wire fence was cut between
every post. Somo parlies wore sus
picioned but no Inicc of evidenco could
be found that gave tho officers a chance
to arrest anyone. Rlood hounds were
sent for and they worked faithfully
on the case and no doubt were pnr
tially successful as tomorrow Justice
of the Peace McElroy will hear tes
' timnny when the stato will produce
! witnesses trying to place tho blame
I on certain parties.
Two miles of tho fence belonged to
J. L. Wood and one mile to II. L. Ham
ilton. It is not known why anybody
would do pucIi a contemptible trick
and if it is proven who the man or
men were any punishment, no matter
. how Govcre, will bo acceptable to the
public in general.

CAPTURED
WHO'S OUR MAYOR?
This question will no doubt bo set
tled next week when Judge Lieb comes
to Tucumcnrl for tho purposo of hear
ing arguments why Mr. Israel should
not and why he should bo mayor.
Judge Lieb wus here on election day
and fully understands tho proposition
and the citizens of Tucumcarl believe
ho will bo impartial in tho matter. Of
course it looks liko a needless ex
pense to go through with this con
test. In tho first place, no person in New
Mexico, who has ovor taken particular
notico to the elections held in this
state, or in nny other Htato for that
matter, over saw a perfect election.
There were votes that wero wrong but
moro of them wero on tho side oppo
site to that which elected Mr. Israel.
Only ono voter, who mny or may not
have voted for Mr. Israel, has oven
been suspicioned. None of tho clerks
or judges of Ward four will swear to
any irregulnritics. They say they do
not know whether they put ono too
mnny in or not, but Judge Lieb will
decide that matter next week, or thnt
is tho date set for tho hoaring of the
case.
AN ASSEMBLING CAMP
Tucumcari will make a bid to be
como ono of the assembling camps, a
place where tho troops from the east
and north will be concentrated for
tmlnlnn Vi M.. .!. I f'.. 1 L.
' ing sent to the border. This town is
in a direct line from tho east to El
Pnso nnd if tho wenther gets much
I hotter in Mexico than it hns here the
, past few days it must be hot down
there. Tucumcari is near enough to
tho border to admit of troops being
moved there quickly but is sufficiently
removed to tnnkc possiblo the assembl
ing and training of green soldiers with
out dnngcr of attack, and this makes
; Tucumcari nn ideal placo for getting
j the eastern and northern guardsmen
ready for service in Mexico.
, This mnttcr should be pushed by the
merchants and professional men as
well as the chamber of commerce be
j cause it would mean much to our city
to have Tucumcari chosen ns a train
ing or concentration camp.

CITIZENS
GIVING
LIBERALLY TO Y. M.
G.A.
The Y. M. C. A. spirit has taken
hold on tho citizens of Tucumcari us
no other proposition over did. It now
seems thnt every man in town is moro
than willing to doi.utu IiIk share to
this worthy cause. Somo men who
have but little property, aro signing
up for $100 each. This money will not
all have to bo paid at once, nnd it
means that the railroad company will
give $200 for every $100 given by a
private individual.
An enthusiastic meeting was held
at the tabernacle lust night and the
interest Bhown was remarkable. Tho
citizens nro anxious for a Y. M. C. A.,
and will give liberally. Every prop
erty owner should donate something.
Committees wero appointed to can
vass tho town and thoy commenced
work Thursday morning. The report
from the solicitors sounds good when
they say nearly every man asked said
put me down and Tucumcar' portion
of tho $25,000 will bo rcudy to turn
over to the Y. M. C. A. general com
mittco before two wcek3. Then plans
will be sent to tho railroad committco
and before six months Tucumcnri will
havo a building it may well feel proud
of. There is nothing bettor than n
modern l. M. C. A. It h self-supporting
after it is onco opened to tho
public. Tho public rending room uro
a popular place for tho young man
and visitors to our town. The gym.
mnKcs the boys like tho place and tho
bath privileges mako it posniblo for
members to keep perfectly sanitary.
No town ever had a Y. M. C. A.
but what was proud of tho fact. A
thing worth doing at nil is woith do
ing right. Thero is no us to build
u $15,000 building when it is just about
as easy to build ono for ?2i".000.
The singing evangelist, Mr. Swiir-
erty, has launched a boosto song for
tno good of the cause and will assist
the locul committees in rousing all tho
interest possible.
Luncheon was served today to tho
committees by tho Method st ladies;
tomorrow the Uaptist ladies will serve
lunch nnd Saturday tho Presbyterian
ladies will cheer up tho workers by
serving tho lunch. Tho following cap
tains wore chosen nnd tho nubhc can
sco that Tucumcarl means business:
Engineers Wm. Wntkins.
Firemen S. A. Rnmsdalo.
Trainmen J. H. Hnckett.
Conductors W. C. Amelon.
Office Men W. S. Walters.
Shop Men Al Codington.
Business Men S. M. Wharton.
Citizens Team A. D. Goldenbcrg.
Many others are working faithfully
on the proposition and unless the un
expected huppens there will bo re
joicing over tho success of the solicit
ing committee before the end of two
weeks.
TO MY FRIENDS
Tho primary is over and tho nomi
nees for the Democratic party nro se
lected. Those chosen wore not all to
my satisfaction, but I am willing to
lino up nnd work for them. Demo
crats should work harmoniously to
gether because our admirable presi
dent, who stands for "pence prosper
ity and prepnrcdness," mu t bo re
elected In order thnt litis nation muy
bo guided moro safely through any
future crisis, thnn it possibly could bo
if wo should put tho governmental
reins In the hand of n new and un
known lender.
I desire to thnnk my friends who
stood by mo in my race for district
nttorney. I was anxious to do my part
in making this stato a better place in
which to live and have our being, but
tho mnjority voted ngainst me, and if
the people nro satisfied I will do my
part to help elect tho entire ticket.
Yours for Democracy,
