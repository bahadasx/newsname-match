Mexioans Blunder,
if-- official Mexican dispatches were de
llvered to Lansing indicating that the
Mexican forces thought the American
•v troops coming to Carrizal intended to
take the town. Mr. Arrendondo said he
called Lansing's attention to the dls
£^"tance gone by the American troops from
5 their base and to what he called "the
lack of prudence of the American com
mander tn approaching the Mexican
railway."
He said his report showed that sev
^onteen American1 soldiers had been
t, kr5-taken but did not give the number
•Jellied on either side.
Secretary Lansing had,no official ln
ffcformatlon on which to discuss the Car

Blames Americana.
The communication wired by General
*. Agullar to Carrinza's foreign minister
follows:
"Please bring to the attention of the
jfedepaxtment of state that an engage
f^iinent occurred today. (21st) at Car
rizal, near Villa Ahumada, Chihuahua,
b' between American forces numbering
/. about 200 men, with a force of Mexi

other of our troops were killed. There

"According to. the statement made by

"Please make proper representations

'-which entered Mexico via Columbus.
Further details will follow."
Show of Grim Purpose.
While the government had' no official
confirmation early today of the report
.. that American and Mexican troops wera
:in
battle yesterday, there was a show of
grim, purpose about the war and state
pi ^departments.
|ap Secretary Baker conferred with Pres
ife^ldent Wilson and Secretary Lansing re
garding reports from the border. Aft
erward Mr. Baker hastened to the cap
itol for conferences wlth_the congres
^4 klonal military committee chairmen.
^^!le submitted to Chairman Hay a'reso
lution authorizing the president to draft
national guardsmen willing to take the
i. federal oath Into the regular army im
mediately.
Officials said President Wilson would
await a definite report from General
Per«hlng before any further steps arc
I taken. Word from General Pershing
was not expected until late today, na
J? Carrlzzail is sixty miles or more' from
General Pershing's base.
Pelioy Unehangad.
At the White House it was said the
president's policy was unchanged for
UM present at least
gw»t«*y Raker said no marching or
ders haiT gone to national guard unit*.
KothJjur o*uld ba dona tie declared, un­
..s
til a report from. American sources had
been received.
There were no .efforts to conceal the
anxiety with which- the situation was
viewed. There is enough similarity
amonp the border reports .to convince
them that a serious' clash occurred.
Whoever may have been the aggressor
and whatever the outcome, It has
brought war with Mexico so close that
officials say any hour may see the con
flict in full swing.
Seeking 'to,. Shirlc Blame.
Prom the tone of the iMexican note,
as well as the contents, officials are
under the impression that Carranza
desires to disclaim* responsibility for
the affair and to mak£ it plain that
no attempt has been made to carry out
his threat to undertake expulsion of
the American expedition by force of
arms.
iFurther information regarding the
activity for peace of foreign diplomats
at iMexlco City reached the state de
partment during' the day. From the
same sources it was learned that Car
ranza was exerting every possible ef
fort to avoid a break with the United
States and a 6 the same time restrain
belligerent demands of some of his
own advisers.
War department officials say that if
It Is true that seventeen American sol
diers are prisoners In the hands of
Mexicans they will be released as soon
as possible. A demand for their Im
mediate release would be one of. the
first steps taken by the United States
government-''"
So far the government has no official
Information of its own whatever re
garding the Carrizal fight.
Callers who saw the president today
goti the Impression that-he is deter-'
mined that If, despite all efforts to
prevent it, war with Mexico should
come, action, of the .United States
would be prompt and on a scale of
considerable magnitude. iMr. Wdlson is
said to be ready if necessary to use
the maximum military strength of the
nation for a short, decisive campaign
to« re-establish order and stable gov
ernment in Mexico.
Bobs Up in Senate.
Discussion of the Mexican situation
was precipitated in the senate today
by Senator Works, of 'California, who
called up his resolution to authorize
Intervention, had it read and gave
notice that unless ithe foreign Ela
tion committed acted soon, he would
move to take the-matter out of the
committee's hands.

MEXICAN VERSION GIVEN.
Blames Americana and Saya They
Opened Fire First.
El Paso, June 22.—At an early hour
last night the only official details of
the engagement received here came
from the Mexican side of the river.
General Gonzales said that his infor
mation was transmitted to him from
Villa Ahumada by Col, Genovso Rivas,
who commanded the Mexicans after
their leader, General Gomez, was slain.
According to General Gonzales he was
informed by General Gomez at Villa
Ahumada last night of the presence of
the Americans westward bound be
tween Villa Ahumada and El Valle.
He says he immediately instructed
General Gomez tb proceed to the Santo
Domingo ranch where the Americans
were reported in "unknown force," and
to advise their commander to retire
to. their camp.
This, he says, "General Gomez did
this morning." The American com
mander, whose name was not given by
General Gomez,' is said to have replied
that he was instructed to proceed to
Villa Ahumada and must do so.
Americana Attacked First?
The statement issued by the Juarez
commander reads:
"immediately ujjon learning of the
presence of American troops in the
vicinity of Carrizal, Gen. Felix Gomez
dispatched a messenger with a request
that the American commander with
draw to his camp. When the Ameri
can troops remained motionless he
sent a second dispatch bearer, who
was fired upon by the American
troops, after he had delivered his mess
age. The Americans immediately
moved forward and attacked General
Gomez's command.
"All the prisoners admitted that the
blame should be put on the American
.commander for .having ordered the at
taclc." -The prisoners were sent to Chi
huahua City with the customary pro
tection."
Mexicans Had Advantage.
Whichever side began the engage
ment, the Mexicans had the advan
tage, for they ha4 provided themselves
with machine gun, and. thia is sup
posed to harf done deadly execution in
the ranks of the Americans. That the
iatter' were noC 'ln^fflcieut, however,
was proved! by the' liumbervof Mexican
dead and wounded removed^to Villa
Ahumada and witnessed by Americans
coming north on a train bound to
Juarez.
The battle began about 10:30 a. m.
and lasted not mbre than an hour. It
apparently ended by both Sides with
drawing.
ARABS IN REVOLT
CAPTURE MECCA
Mohammedans, Convinced of Holy
Treason of Turks, Arise and Cap
ture Preoious Cities of Arabia, Pro
claiming Independence.
•London, June 22 .— Reports reached
here that a serious uprising against the
Turks is in progress in Arabia and that
the rebels have captured the holy city
of Mecca.
The London papers declare that the
rebellion is certain .to have an import
ant bearing on the war, especially re
garding the participation of Turkey.
The Post says:
"The uprising is due to recent whole
sale execution of Mohammedan ana
'Syrian notables and well known reli
gious leaders and also to the spread ».i
Arabia of a feeling that the Turks have
ahdicated their position as the protec
tors of Mohammedans and have be
come vassals of Germany."
A Reuter dispatch from Tyro says
the rebels, in addition to taking Mecca,
have captured Jlddah, the chief sea
port of Arabia, and Taif, sixty-iive
mi'es southeast of Mecca, and have
proclaimed independence of the Arabs
from Turkish rule.
According to this dispatch the grand
shereef of Mecca, chief magistrate of
the holy city, proclaimed his independ
ence and was supported by the Arab
tribes of the west and central parts of
the country. He began operations
about June 9.
It is said the garrlsohs at Mecca,
Jlddah and Taif surrendered, with the
exception of two small forts at Taif
which are resisting. At Jlddah forty
five officers, 1,400 men and six guns
were taken. Medlnah, 248 miles north
west of Mecca, which contains the
tomb of Mohamme^, Is closely besieged
and all communications to Hejas are
in the hands of the grand shereef.

Athens, via London, June 22.—Under
heavy pressure from tjie entente pow

government would do responded:
"How can we renounce the sov
ereignty of our country?"

nonpolitical lines even including one

CARRIZAL FIGHT
QUICKENS THE CALL
Sounds Doublequick For Iowa Guard
and Two Regiments May Be Called
to Camp Dodge Tonight—First In
fantry to Move Saturday #r Sunday.
Special to Times-Republican.
Des Moines, June 22,—Adjutant Gen
eral Logan gave out a statement this
morning to the effect that before night
possibly two regiments of the Iowa
National Guard will be mobilized im
mediately at 'Camp Dodge on account
of serious over-night developments in
the Mexican situation.
Governor Clarke today issued a call
to bring the companies of the. national
guard up to required peace strength,
urging that these eligible respond to
the colors. The First infantry is re
cruited and ready to move. It will
come to Des Moines Saturday or Sun
day. 'Mexican Consul Jack Danciger,
at Kansas City, has written to Gov
ernor Clarke asking pvot.»ction of Mex
icans in Iowa.
All the local units of the guard broke
camp at the armory today arid de
parted for Camp Dodge.
Altho no statement to that effect
was given out, it was thought probably
that the units to be called would be the
Third Infantry and the cavalry troops,
the latter in camp on the state rifle
range near Iowa City.
Local officials of the military believe
that definite order® from the war de
partment will be forthcoming as the
result of the clash between Carranza
and United States troops yesterday. Up.
to a late hour today no word had been I
received from Washington.
Governor George W. Clarke today is
sued a proclamation calling for vol
unteers In the national guard, in which
he said:
"It is anticipated that at any mo
ment the Iowa troops may be called
into action. Iowa must be able at once
to respond 'ready.' Therefore I do here
by. as authorized by law, call for a
sufficient number of volunteers to
bring the companies and regiments to
required strength and as Iowa has al
ways responded at once heretofore, to
the call of the colors, so now no doubt
is entertained that a report of. full
strength by enlistment will be received
at once."
No orders for mobilization had been
received by Adjutant General Logan up
to 2 p. m. today.
