As to soil conditions, they dif
fer vastly in these states. It is
generally conceded by those who
have studied the merits and de
merits of the soil that of Florida
is better adapted to citrus fruit
'raising. The Florida and Cali
fornia soils are both fertile for
truck farming, but in California
the business is carried on at a
great expense on account of its
dependence on the irrigation sys
tem, while in Florida irrigation
is not necessary, except in case
of a long drought.
Unless I am greatly mistaken,
Cotton, corn and other general
crops are not grown in California,
and the culture of California's

loose, sandy soil we grow a mag
nificent root system and the trees
can be transplanted with naked
roots. In California their soil
richer and heavier, so that the,
young plant does not require such
a large amount of feeding roots
and the result is that if they try
to take up a tree and plant it
with naked roots they lose a
large proportion of them and the
only way in "which they can suc
cessfully make a tree live is 'to
dig around it and put a sack un

with the citrus industry of that

There is talk of establishing a
lenatured alcohol distillery at
Jacksonville to use up the refuse
of Florida fields. Alcohol can be
made from any vegetable matter
which contains starch or sugar.
There is a growing demand for
denatured alcohol, for mechanical
uses and, to a small extent in med
icines for external uses. Event
ually, there will be a market for
everything that grows on Florida
soil. Even weeds make a good
compost to enrich the soil so that
valuable crops may grow. After
all of a crop that the markets and
the canneries will purchase has
been gathered there may be some
thing left suitable for the making
of denatured alcohol. In that day
the raising of truck crops in Flor
ida will cease to be what it has of

with the markets." It will have
no uncertainties except those con

of the Governors' Conference:
"Salt Lake City, Utah, June 16,
1916. Sincerely trust you will
attend coming conference with

We learn that Gilchrist will
not accept this invitation, as he
is now attending" to his private
business at Waycross, Georgia;
He will be absent two or three
months, visiting his relatives
South Carolina, before returning
to runta Gorda.

The Fort Meade Leader says
the farmers of that section are
finding the cannery there their
next best friend to a good market.
Green beans had brought satisfac
tory prices and the bean raisers
would have had to pocket a loss
had it not been for the cannery
which paid fair prices for what
remained of their crop and enab
led them to make something of
their seasons outlay. It has taken
care of their surplus cabbage crop
and is doing so now with tomato
es. This cannery finds a ready
market for its output of 1,000
cans a day.
Does it require much imagina

around Fort Meade arc living bet

Washington. D. C With Pres
ident Wilson's firm refusal to
withdraw American troops from,
Mexico, a note arraigning Car
ranza's course in a situation
which has brought the two coun
tries to the verge of war, th ad
ministration continues its prepar
ation to meet any emergency that
may arise. War or peace rests
with Carranza. The position of
the United States is pointedly set
forth in its review of the appar
ent inability of Carranza to pre
vent border raids and to keep the.
obligation he owes the world by
the preservation of order in his
dominions. )
"If," says the note,
the defaeto government is pleas
ed to ignore this obligation and to
believe that 'in case of a refusal
to retire these troops there is no
further recourse than to defend
its territory by an appeal to
arms,' the government of the U
nited States would surely be
lacking in sincerity and friend
ship if it did not frankly impress
upon the defaeto government that
the execution of this threat will
lead to the gravest consequence.
While this government would
deeply regret such a result it can
not recede from its "settled de
termination to maintain its na-'
tional rights and perform its duty
in preventing further invasions of
the territory of the United States
and in removing the peril which
Americans along the internation
al boundary have borne so long
with patience and forbearance."
The note was handed to iiihsco
Arredondo, the Mexican ambassador-designate
here, for transmis
sion to Mexico City. Copies were
furnished to all the foreign em
bassies and legations and a sum
mary cabled to Special Agent
Rodgers at the Mexican capital.
In addition to refusing to with
draw the troops and warning that
execution of the threat to attack
them would be followed by the
gravest consequences, the note
serves notice that as long as the
Carranza forces retain their pres
ent attitude no arms, munitions
nor machinery for the manufac
ture of ammunition will bo per
mitted to reach Mexico from the
United States.
In congress steps are being tak
en by chairmen to have the na
tional guard ready for immediate
use by making effective at onco
certain provisions or the militia
bills. Some members feel that
making the militia immediately
available for foreign service
would cause some untoward act.
The regular troops are available
for foreign service and if it
should become necessary to send
in guardsmen the resolutions
then could be rushed through,
they say.
Reports to the war department
indicated that the mobilization
was proceeding satisfactorily.

says that, if ants make nests in

it's the deadliest poison known.
