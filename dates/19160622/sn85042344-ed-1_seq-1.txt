Pershinsr bud been unable to pet
to (Ieneral Funston late tonight
any report of the enanvmont,
but there appeared no reason to
doubt the report from Mexican
sources that a serious enjraro

was little doubt that the Amer
icans, a detae.hmeut of the Tenth
cavalry, n negro organization,
had suffered heavily.
According to the report, forty
Americans were killed by ma
chine gun fire in a surprise at
tack. Tension Higher.
Instead of the tension being
broken by the clash it whs keyed
still higher tonight and there ap
peared no probability that it
would be lessened until the of
ficial report from Oeneral F'er

Tulsii has an organization of which
any city should ho proud, and which

All 'lav yesterday there gathered

WASIIINOTON, Juno 21. Some
lnllm.it ion as to what (ieneral
Carnir.z i s next sten w ould In was ex
pected hourly tonight at the state de
partment, official advices reported
Hint the American rejection of tho
demand for the recall of (.ieneral
Pershing's troops from Mexico was
unikr oonslil .ration today by the first
chler and his cabinet.
Special Agent Rodgers, who mado
the report, was unable to forecast tho
action of the do facto government,
and threw little light on what was
gi lug on in the Mexican capitul. I'iom
other sources, however. It wus learned
thai Kui'opean diplomats are exert
ing pressure on Carranza to prevent
him from going to war with tho
I 'luted States. The entente allies uro
paiiiiiilarly anxious. It is understood,
that nothing sic 1H.1l occur at this time
to Mil nt off Ihe oil supplies for tho
French and Hrillsh navies from tho
T.implco fields.
(.criii.llls Working.
Allied diplomatic representatives In
Mexico believe also that Herman In
fluences have I n win king on Car
ranza in n n effort to create a situation
tli.it might embarrass the enemies of
the central powers. They have as
sorted that (Icrmaii agencies have
been active ill .stirring up feeling
against the Celled States not only In
Mexico, hut tlirou;lioiit Smth and
Central America to prevent this coun
try from obtaining trade formerly
controlled by Herman merchants.
It Is underslood tint Hie diplomats
have pointed out to (Ieneral Car
ranza that tie American note only
declines to consider Immediately any
suggestion that its tr )ops be with
drawn from Mexico, ami that It
quotes a portion of the agreement
between (ieneral Scott and I Ieneral
obrcgon providing, among other
thing's, for the gradual withdrawal of
the torees.
Another suggestion Is that the dis
pute over bolder conditions could
well he r ferred to an international
commlsHion under tho treaty of IMS
between the two countries. Diplo
matic officials here are known to be
lieve that President Wllsi n would
consider such a suggestion if he nii-i
with no Interference in the
meantime
In his efforts to guard the
American
border from bandits.

The slate department hud no offi

transpiring. It Is believed the assur

would make war on Mexico only If
driven to It by attack, bav, been re
peated to diplomatic callers seeking
information. Tin se assurances may
have paved the way for the represen

ing iiiui not to force tho issue he has
raised.
A study of all (ieneral Carrinzi's
eoinmunications and actions during
the last few inonihs. howt vi r. has

a hopeful view. Ills attitude has been
