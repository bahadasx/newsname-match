El Paso, Texas, June 21. Large
forces of American cavalry tonight
are making a sixty-mile ride at break
neck speed to the rescue of their com
rades in the Tenth regiment, who are
engaged in a terrific battle at great
odds with strong Carranza troops at
Carrizal, eighty-eight miles south of
El Taso, and who are in danger of an
nihilation by superior forces.
At least forty of the American sol
diers had been killed in the early
stages of the battle, a large number
were wounded and seventeen were
taken prisoners and escorted to the
garrisoned town of , Villa Ahumada,
ten miles from Carrizal.
Thruout the region of Carrizal are
' many thousand Carranza soldiers who
have been secretly concentrated in
that vicinity recently and these are be
lieved to be hurrying forward to take
part in the engagement.
The ride of the American cavalry
tonight will go down in history as one
of the most brilliant events in the
records of the American army. .The
starting points of the cavalry forces
that have been ordered to Carrizal are
not known here, as the exact location
f General Pershing's forces has been
kept secret,' but it is estimated that
nearly all will have to jide fifty or six-
ty miles to reach the battle ground.
I With the American forces concentrat
ing and the Carranza troops undoubt
edly rushing to take part, the battle
may develop into one -of .immense
proportions lasting several days. It is
believed here that the troops station
ed at El Paso .will immediately begin
a southward movement, seizing Juar-
ez and then the Mexican railways.
General Herring had warm praise.
Washington, June 21. The details
of President Wilson's reply to the Inst
Carranza note were made public this
morning. Wilson threatens Carranza
. with the gravest consequences in the
' event he permits the expedition to be
attacked. He also criticised Carran
za's failure to cooperate. with the ex
' pedition and resented the tone of Car
ranzaVnote. (Continued on page Eight)

SADIE "COMES BACK"
Q Sadie, how do you feel?
A Well, you know I am a girl and
they always feel good.
Q I notice that the "Snooze"
keeps on harping about that election
contest between Judge Toombs and
Mr. .Vigil on the one, side and G. C.
Smith and Serapio Miera on the other
side; what are the facts about that
contest?
A The real facts are: That Mr. Vi
gil and Judge Tombs were beaten in
the election through trickery, and
they filed their contests strictly un
der the laws of New Mexico, in order
that the true facts might -be estab
lished at the hearing of their contest.
Q How was the hearing conduct
ed? . -
A About like the hearing in any
case; both parties had their lawyers
and their witnesses, and all the testi
mony was written down.
Q Then, what was done with this
testimony ;
A It was sent to the Speaker of
the House of Representatives, and by
him turned over to the Committee on
Privileges unc. Elections to sift out
the facts.
Q What sort of a report of these
contests was made to the Legislature?
A report which found the grounds
of the contests to be true and favored
the seating of Mr. Vigil and Judge
Toombs:
Q Is there any public record of
the Legislative proceedings regilrd
these contests?
A Yes, a full report of all the Leg
islature said and did in the case, can
be found in the House Journal of the
last Legislature, beginning at page 28.
Q Many people do not have the
House Journal, and for their benefit,
can you tell of some of the facts found
by the Legislature?
A The substance of the Legislative
findings was:
1 That .Precinct 4 is a Republican
precinct, and that the Demo
cratic County Clerk of Union
County, through fraud and col
lusion with one of the Democratic
Judges of that precinct, failed
. to have any ballot box for that
voting precinct.
2 That in the Republican Precinct
No. 14, the voting place was
changed from where it was ori
ginally fixed a distance of 12 1-2
miles, and that said change was
made "at the instance and re
quest of Serapio Miera and
G. C. Smith."
3 That in the Republican Precinct
No. 20, the voting place was
changed a distance of 8 or 9
miles.
4 That, in Republican precinct No.
24, the voting place was. changed
a distance of 4 miles.
5 That after a voting place has
been once fixed, it is against the
law to change it.
. Q How did the Legislature find
that these several voting places were
changed vat the instance and request
of Mr. Miera and Mr Smith"?
A For the reason that Salome Gar
cia, chairman 'of the Commissioner's
Court testified that his court made the
changes because Miera and Smith
wanted them made.

Q What do you think of the action
of the Legislature in this contest mat
ter? A I consider it to be a well merited
rebuke of the political methods em
ployed by the, then leaders of the De
mocratic party in this County, and
that it will make for honest elections
and a fair count in the future.
Q What fixes the voting place in
each precinct?
A The Commissioners Court.
Q Who sends the ballot boxes out
to those places ?
A The County Clerk.
Q Well, suppose at some election,
no ballot boxes reached any republi
can precincts, what would be the re
sult? A You know I am a girl and eschew
strange language, but if such a thins;
happened, I believe the, Republicans
would be in a L of a fix.
Q What other contests do you know
about? .
A When Judge Toombs was elected
to the Legislature in 1911, the' Demo
crats contested him as soon as the
votes were counted served the pa
pers on him in the night time they
were in such a hurry to put him out.
Q What was he result of this con
test? .
A The Legislature could find no
thing in the charges to base a report
on.
Q How were V igil and Toombs de
feated? A According to the judgment of
the Legislature, they were defeated
by the illegal and fraudulent acts
of the Democrats, in failing to hold
an election in one Republican pre
cinct, and unlawfully changing the
voting places in three .other Republi
can Precincts.
Q How were they seated?
A By the judgment oí the Legis
lature, representing all the people of
the st&t6
Q Who said, "Stop Thief?"
A The whole people of the State
of New Mexico, acting through its
Law making body. .

New Home Nearing Completion
Work on T. H. Rixey's modern- res
idence is progressing rppidly. The
near completion of this home has al
ready changed 'the apenfanei' o'f that
pa ". of Clayton as it is i hanosome
stnu,fure and "square uu tht block
fcrnering with the High s.hool.
Mrs. Dayton Messenger and little
daughter were in the city yesterday
from the ranch visiting' Mrs. Hayden
Edmondson.
Field Hospital company No. 1 and
Field Ambulance company No. 1 pass'
ed through Clayton about 10 o'clock
today enroute to El Paso, from Fort
D. A. Russell. Their orders read for
"immediate duty in Mexico." The train
consisted of about 20 cars. Some 400

Clayton Mill, BurnH
The Clayton i Mill, one or Union
county's best industries burned to a
junk heap Friday night, it is sup
posed that the fire, which wa discov
ered about 9:30 o'clock, started in the
motor room from a short circuit. Tin
loss is placed at about $12,000.
Dr. N. E. Charlton, the owner, says
that he does not feel able to undertake
the rebuilding of the mill this year.
It is with regret that we chronicle
the destruction of this enterprise as
it has proved a valuable institution
in Clayton commercial field.
There is rumor of a company erect
ing a modern mill here in the near fu
ture. MORE EQUIPMENT FOR JOB DE
PARTMENT The Citizen Job Department this
week added another series of the very
latest in type design making sufficient
type for nearly every branch of com
mercial and society printing. '
The main adition to the Department
this week however, is another and
faster job press. .The Citizen's is now
the only job shop in this section hav
ing the two standard job presses.
This smaller and faster press will
permit the Department to turn out
wojfk in even a shorter time than at
present.
New Mexico Guards Make Good
Showing
"New Mexico has sufficient guards
men to muster in eleven companies of
65 men each. We are about 60 men
short, but we hope to have a complete
regiment in a few days."
Such was the declaration of Adjut
ant General Harry T. Herring, of the
New Mexico National Guard, who is
back from the border to spend a few
days here looking after certain details
of the guard.
It seemed to be the belief of Gen
eral Herring that the New Mexico
guard and the guardsmen of Arizona
and Texas, will be the first to go into
Mexico should the National Guard of
the United States have to be sent in
to that country, the border states tak
ing precedence because they had their
men mobilized and in service at the
border for weeks.
The guard as it now stands at the
New Mexico border is composed as
follows: 11 companies of 65 men, 715;
in batalion, 133; officers, 56; total 910
men.
H. M. Forvood was a visitor from
Albuquerque this week.
