Political Pointers.
To the Republican bosses: We will
take four more years of Wilson, peace
and prosperity. We "let well enough
alone." We take no chances in these
perilous times. Signed, The People.
The insincerity of the politicians in
control of the Chicago convention is
apparent. If they really meant what
they said in their speeches and are
in earnest in the platform declarations,
they want war. Still they fail to
point out a single instance to justify
war. Furthermore, they know that
the constitution vests the power to
declare war in Congress and no Re
publican Congressman has introduced
in either house a resolution deolaring
war. In view of this their attempt to
make a case against Wilson by "glit
tering generalities" and innuendo is
such an inglorous failure as to ap
proach the pitiable.
Harding's keynote in the Republican
National Convention was a humililing
whine for harmony, and an offer of
"amends" to the Progressives if they
will only surrender their principles
and come back to the old home shack.
There's nothing there but husks; no
robe, no ring, no fatted calf, not even
pie. The chances for pie in the future
are too slender to appeal to a Progres
sive, unless his situation is desperate.
The real Progressive actuated by
principle has enlisted under the Wil
son banner and is marching with the
victorious army. -
Pemocrats will be glad to be in
formed who it is that has promised to
disregard the mandate of the consti
tution and prevent the people from
passing on any proposition they desire
to act npon. If John Swanger or any
body else has made Shupp and Jones
any such promises, the people, should
have the , information Candidates
should have no secret obligations nor
side lines. ' It the plain provisions of
the constitution are to be nullified,
the rule of the people denied and gag
rule established, the , people wish to
know the identity of the chaps pro
posing . the stunts. Shupp, Jones,
Swanger & Co., should be made' to
divulge.
Not even such an expert fakir as
Roosevelt can get by with a false Issue
against Woodrow Wilson. The at
tempt to raise the issue of American
ism was the cheapest performance
staged In recent political history. It
didn't deceive even tbe stark idiots.
The fine Americanism of Wilson has
been a featnre of the present adminis.
tratlon and everybody capable of en
tertaining an Idea knows it. The at
tempt to steal this honor' from the
President was as foolish as it was
mendacious. , '
That "busted treasury" made a gain
during the month of May. According
the Auditor's monthly statement the
balance was a little larger June 1 than
May f, and every warrant paid. oThis
. wasn't good enough news to the
Qlobe-Democrat and Post-Dispatch to
F. P. AKE, Publisher.

Thli Is the
iide of tbe

be admitted to their columns. If
these papers can get hold hold of a
false rumor discrediting, to the State,
they smear it on over the front page
in an effort to dupe the people and
aid partisan plans. ' ''
The Democratic voters of Missouri
on August 1 will select the ticket for
the Democratic party. In this action
they are not going to submit to the
dictation of Republicans and assistant
Republicans. If Republican voters are
willing to let these would-be bosses
dictate to them and ratify the selection
of John Swanger, they may do so;
that's their business. But all the indi
cations are that the voters of both
parties have made up their minds to
resent the impudence of the dictators
and attend to the job themselves in
their own way, as is their privilege
and duty under the law as citizens.
Futhermore, it is evident that the ef
forts of these self-appointed guardians
of the voters to embarrass Democratic
candidates and prejudice the people,
are meeting the large measure of pop
ular indignation such actions deserve.
After the primary the Democratic
convention will meet and promulgate
the Democratic platform and the
nominees will stand on that platform,
fight the enemy to a finish and win a
rousing victory in November. The
would-be dictators had just as well
stand aside.
The Industrial Home for Negro
Girls, located at Tipton, was recently
completed and is now open for the
reception of Incorrigibles. The insti
tution was established by the Legisla
ture In 1909, but Governor Hartley's
administration did nothing toward its
construction. In the construction of
the home this administration has ex
pended approximately $100,000, a bur
den that came over to it from Had'.ey,
This is in addition to tho $476,000 in
unpaid bills Hadley's administration
left as a legacy for; its Demooratio
successors. In dodging responsibility
and leaving unpaid bills the Hadley
administration waB a blue ribbon tak
er. That is one of several reasons
why Missouri will not vote to turn Us
affairs over to the Republican bosses
in November. ,

exuberant, hilarious Republicans, No,
George still has just the one son.
'Tlsn't that. It's a telegram. .The
telegram does not convey the startling
news that Woodrow Wilson has been
renominated for President of the
United States. Nothing of the sort.
In fact George would' not have
been particularly elated even In get

George was a delegate to the National

Wayne County Iron Mines Resume.
(Wayne County Journal.)
F. F. Shuiar, who has made Poplar
Bluff his home for several months,
while tn Greenville Tuesday, informed
us that he had again accepted a posi
tion with the Orah Land and Invest
ment Company, and was now acting
as foreman of the Carnegie iron mine,
between Greenville and Williamsville,
which has resumed operations.
The mines at Keener are also being
worked and it is reported that other
mines in the territory contingent to
the Ozark Valley will be opened. The
mines have been closed for several
years on account of a lack of a market.
The St. Louis Blast furnace, the only
available market west of the Missis
sippi river, suspended operations in
1910 and high freight rates pro
hibited shipping the local ore east
of the river. The high price of 'iron
products has proved an incentive for
the re-opening of the St. Louis fur
nace and it Is now being overhauled
preparing to resume business.
The Iron mines formerly gave em
ployment to many men and teams in
the county and that they will resume
workis welcome news, indeed,
Coal in Arkansas in 1915. 4
A large part of the coal produced in
Arkansas is used for locomotive fuel,
so that retrenchments In operating ex
penses by the railroad companies and
competition with fuel oil from near-by
fields have seriously Interfered' with
tbe output of coal in Arkansas. Ao
oording to C. E. Lesher, of the U. S.
Geological Su rvey, the production in
1915 was 1,652,106 short tons, valued at
92,950,456, as compared with 1,636,640
tons, valued at 93,158,168 in 1914, and
over 2,000,000 tons, valued at nearly
14,000,000, In 1913. -
Sebastian County, which produces
about 70 per cent of the total for the
State, decreased more than a quarter
of a million tons, whereas all other
counties recorded increases. The out-1
OUR OOD, OUR COUNTRY AND TRUTH.
put of coal in 1915 in Sebastian Coun
ty, 1,153,494 tons, was the lowest since
1900 and is 720,000 tons less than in
1907, the record year for that field.
The advance in the price of fuel oil
late in 1915, if continued, will propably
bave the effect of increasing the use
ot Arkansas coal and assist that State
to recover to some extent the mar
kets that have been lost within late
years.
There were 3,751 men employed in
and about the coal mines of Arkansas
in 1915, who worked for an average
of 149 days, as compared with 4,339
men for 143 days in 1914.
Hensley Plays Important Part.
A special from Washington, D. 0.,
to the St. Lonis Republic dated May
18, says: A naval appropriation bill
that ignores the five-year building
program of Secretary Daniels, but
authorizes new construction at once
to the amount of $160,000,000, was
voted by tbe House Committee on
Naval Affairs to-day.
The committee also approved the
proposal of Representative Hensley of
Missouri that $200,000 be set aside for
the promotion ot an iuternational
court of arbitration and naval dis
armament at tbe end of the European
war. The bill, as reported, meets with
approval of Majority Leader Kitchin
and other influential democrats.
By a curious combination of cir
cumstances the bill will go to the
house as a partisan measure. The
eight republican - members of the
Naval Affairs committee fought all
along the line for a bigger navy. In
every instance the republicans, who
played politics from start to finish,
voted for a greater number of vessels
than were finally authorized, yet the
minority voted against the smaller
number. For instance, the republi
cans fought for six battle cruisers but
voted against five when the demo
cratic members combined on that
number, ohiefly through the influence
of Representative Hensley of Mis
souri, who lined up the "small navy"
men at the last minute at the request
of Chairman Padgett.
Secretary Daniels is understood to
night to be satisfied with the action of
the house committee. He congratulat
ed Mr. Hensley for his part in check
ing the republicans' political maneu
ver. .
Editor Weds Noted Singer.
(Poplar Blurt Republican.)
Whenever an editor takes it into
his head to put on something of par
ticular interest to himself and of no
particular interest so far as the public
is concerned, he generally gets away
with it. So when the facts came out
Sunday morning that Editor Will W.
Horton of the Poplar Bluff Citizen
Democrat, and Miss Pauline Meyers
Harrington, the distinguished vocal
ist, had been made husband and wife
at 10 o'clock the night before, friends
were profuse with congratulations,
and thought nothing strange about it
because they had not been told the
time and place that the happy event
was to occur.
The groom obtained the license
before quiting time Saturday, but
made County Recorder Hayes swear
on a stack of bibles as high as the
court house that he would not let any
one know about it until after 10 that
night. Everything seemed to "break"
just right for the conspirators, and
shortly before 10 p. M. the relatives
of the happy bride and groom as
sembled at the First Baptist church
parsonage, where Rev. Paul Weber
said the words which united the lives
and fortunes of the young couple.
Then they repaired to the Gibbons
hotel, where Miss Harrington has
been living during her stay iu the
city this spring, and remained there
until Wednesday, when the bride left
for the east to fill some Chautauqua
engagements which she had contract
ed in advance.
After the close of the Chautauqua
season Mr. and Mrs. Horton will go
to housekeeping and be regular mar
ried folks from that time on.
Both bride and groom are well
known in this city, where they have
spent several happy years of their
lives. Horton is a son of Mr. and
Mrs. M. C. Horton and has been one
of the proprietors of the Citizen
Democrat since last summer. He
looks after the city news and also has
an eye on the business department.
The bride is too well known to
need Introduction. She has acquired
an extensive acquaintance through
out country because of her remark
able voice, and has been in demand
for solo work for several years by
managers of chautauquas. She has
relatives In Poplar Bluff and many
friends, all of whom will wish the
young couple many years of prosper
ity in their voyage on tne matrimo
nial sea.
