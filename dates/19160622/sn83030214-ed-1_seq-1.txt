Under New Law.
Washington, June 21. The national
guard of three states. Kansan, Missouri
and California, received ordera from
the War Department to-n'ight to en
train Immediately for the Mexiean
border.
Thia oraler was issued just as infor
mation was received here that there
had been a fight between American and
Mexiean troops.
"It is quite certain," sad Secretary
Baker to-night, "that other regiments
will go to the border soon, but whether f
that means m a day or two or more I
cannot aay."
Mr. Baker would not d'scuss Gen?
eral Funston'a measage saying how;
many men he wanted as soon aa avai!
abk and to -rhat. pointa he wished them
routed. Major Genera! Scott, chief of
staff, indicated that the first organiza-'
tiona to complete muster into the aer
vice and which are well placed geo
graphicaily wil! be sent forward
promptly.
The general plan ur.der which the
state allotment of troops to be called
out was made is known aa the twelve
division plan, prepared by the War De?
partment in 1912. A later arheme of
orgar.iz.ation haa euperseded thia for |

Scouting Patrol Attacked at Carrizal, 90 Miles South

Taken Prisoner.
[From n .Staff ('orrepponrlent of TVie Tribune ]
El Paso, Tex., June 21. -American cavalrymen of General Pershing's comrnand were am*
bushed by Carranza troops this morning.
This clash came only a few hours after President Wilson's warning to Carranza that an attack
on Pershing's troops would lead to the "gravest consequences."
Forty Americans, according to the Mexiean version, were killed in the battle, which occurred
at Carrizal, about ninety miles south of here. Seventeen other American troopers are deciared to
have been taken prisoner and are being rushed to-night under guard to Chihuahua.
In the absence of any official report to General Funston's headquarters, two versions of the
battle have reaehed here. One, given out by General Francisco Gonzales, Carranza commander at
Inarez. deciared that the Americans first attacked the Mexicans after having refused a request from

GOMEZ KILLED, REPORT TO FUNSTON
Washington. June 21.?General Funston late to-night transmit
ted to the War Department rhe following report from General Bell
at Ei Paso:
"Mexiean Consul Garcia telephones me at 6 p. m. as follows:
'?There was a clash this morning at Carrizal. near Villa Ahumada
between Carranza and American troops, in which General Gomez
and other Mexicans were killed. the number unknown. Number of
Americans killed or wounded unknown.
"General Gomez sent a captain with an order to the American
commander to go back. but the American commander saiu lie was
going to Villa Ahumada and opened fire on the Mexiean captain.
wounding him and killing ? private who was with him. Americans
attacked General Gomez. hut were thrown back and several men
taken prisoner.
"Prisoners were sent to Chihuahua.
"Garcia says this was telephoned at request of General Gonzales.
"An American who was on the train to-day passing Villa Ahu?
mada at 2:30 said he saw sever.il dead Mexicans put on his train,
among them a dead Mexiean general. There were also several Mexi?
ean wounded. He gathered from talk there that the fight was with
American cavalry nine miles west, and that the Americans were de
coyed into a trap by the use of a Mexiean flag of truce, and they
were then fired upon by rrachine guns and they had to retire. Re?
port states our troops engaged were the 10th Cavalry."

.arez. Several troop
traini were pulled late the ralroad
yardf readv for immediaU Qi?
the Carranza officer to withrlraw thoir camp. Heavy losses were
sufl'ered by both sides, the general admits, including the death of
(ieneral Felix (iomez, the Mexican commander.
Another vorsion reaching the border to-night is that the
Americans were the victims of a surprise attaek. The troopers,
who were negroes from the 10th Cavalry, were members of a
scauting patrol from Guzman. They were led into an ambush
of machine guns and cut down before they had ? chance to de?
fend themselves.
What action by Ameriean troopi will follow this attaek is
not yet certain to-night. (ieneral (ieorge Roll, ir.. declared that
he had nol ye. received orders from General Funston u to the
steps to be taken at Kl Paso. though he had made preparations
for any demonstrations on the other side of the Rio (irande.
(ieneral Bell WU informed of the battle by .Mexican Consul
Garcia. He said there was no question that a fight had taken
place. but he declared that he did not believe the report that the
Americans had been taken prisoner.
SAW MANY MEXICAN DEAD AT AHUMADA.
The only apparently authenlic report of what aclually oc
curred at Canizal, out side of the offieial report given out by
(ieneral (lonzales, was brought to El Paso to-night by an Ameri?
ean v ho passed Villa Ahumada, nine miles from the scene of the
fighting, early this afternoon.
.Many .Mexican dead wero lying on thp railway platform at
Villa Ahumada. he declared. and wounded Carranzistas also
were being taken into the town. He saw no Amorican**, either
doad, wounded or prisoners. nor had he heard of any being sent
on to Chihuahua. If Americans had boen killed, he declared,
they wore still at Carrizal.
A detachment of tho 10th Cavalry. aeeording to the most
authentic accountl to-night, wore advancing toward Villa
Ahumada when thoy encountored ihe .Mexicans under (ieneral
Gomez. Carranzistaa had been concontrating there for days,
and it is declared that not less than 30,000 of them wera in that
vicinity at the time.
The two forces met near tho ranch owned by Kullor Rroth
era, of Loi Angeles. Gomez sent a messenger to tho .Xmericans
asking them to retire.
"Our orders aro to advance," was the word of the officer
in charge sent back to tho Carranza general as he ordered his
men to proceed. Tho .Mexicans had placed machine guns under
cover, and as the negro troopers came forward the guns op.-ned
up. After a brief contest the Mexicans retired.
CLASH WAS EXPECTED.
How many Americans were killed and wounded is not
dofinitely known to the Ameriean army officers here. (ieneral
Perahing*! offieial report on the battlo will be mado to (ieneral
'Funston probably to-morrow.
Early to-day it was known that Americans and Mexicans
wore ready to clash west of Villa Ahumada, but .Mexican of?
ficials in Juarez had been instmcted to advise .Mexiean com
mandors to avoid trouble with the .Americans, and it was be?
lieved the conflict would lie averted.
Ameriean army men here think the Mexican version of the
battle is greatly exaggerated. Even if the Mexicans had sur?
prised the Americans and had greatly outnumbered them the
army men are sure the Americans would have been able to hold
their own, and the Mexican claim of an Ameriean defeat and
the flight of Americans is consjdered absurd.
GONZALES BLAMES AMERICANS.
(ieneral C.onzales' first step after eonhrming the news was
to issue a statement placing the blame on the Ameriean com?
mander. He charged that the Ameriean troops fired flrst on
