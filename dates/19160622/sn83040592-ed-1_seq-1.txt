Building and Loan.
The Building, Savings and
Loan Association for the upbuild
of Baxter is now about ready to
complete its organization. A
large membership has been se
cured. The amount of shares
taken by the enterprising and
public-spirited citizens makes a
very creditable showing for a
town of this size. It has been
the desire to organize with not
less than one thousand shares
taken. About eight hundred will
be the amount of shares which
will be in force from the start.
It is a much to be regretted
fact that some of our heaviest
property owners have declined to
assist in this enterprise, as well
as others who will be among the
first , to secure current benefits
from the operations of this or
ganization. Shares nave been
taken by Galena parties as an in
vestment. The committee has
received word from others in Gal
ena that they desire to subscribe
for stock as an investment. The
News will publish in next week's
issue a complete list of the names
of those who have subscribed for
stock in this association, which
is destined to be the most impor
tant improvement and up-build
move made by the people of Bax
ter to date. The organization
will be perfected not later than
Friday night of this week if no
unavoidable delays happen.
Why run over town when you
can get what you want at one
place? We carry guaranteed
lines and sell as cheaply as good
merchandise can be handled. We
pay top cash prices for poul
try, butter, and eggs. We will
meet any mail order house prices.
Besides, money sent away helps
to build churches, schools and
good roads elsewhere. We appre
ciate your business and guarantee
service and satisfaction.

COUNTY. KANSAS. JUNE
Store Robbed.
Some time between midnight
Sunday night and 4 o'clock Mon
day morning the general tner
chandise store of L. M. Blanton
at Lincolnville was robbed. The
burglars entered the side door,
after breaking out the glass and
slipping back the bolt. About
$100 worth of jewelry was taken
as was also a lot of overalls, shoes
and clothing. The Lincolnville
Antis offer a reward for the ar
rest of the thieves, and Mr. Blan
ton also offers a reward.

It's a Joke.
When the city of Galena, act
ing through some of its leading
citizens, stole a part of Baxter
Rural Route No. 3 from Baxter
Springs, it made representations
to the postoffice department,
through an inspector, that the
service to the patrons would be
greatly improved, and that more
people would be benefited by the
change. After several hitches
the change was made.
Tuesday morning the Galena
poit office phoned to the Baxter
postoffice to find out if there were
any mail at Baxter for Galena,
and the statement was made that
if there were somebody would
drive over in a car after it. The
Galena postal officials say that
they have had no mail since Sun
day.
The Galena postal service is an
improvement, we don't think.
And the people who are trying to
get mail from Gilena out on the
rural route formerly served out of
the Baxter office are of the same
opinion.
vThe different rural routes out
of Baxter Springs have been
served without a break in the ser
vice, thank you.
But it did seem like the irony
of fate that Galena should phone
to Baxter Springs and ask for
mail. .

would much rather get their mail
