I Make An Introduction--
BY THE EDITOR
Well, people, 1 waul you all t<> meet Mi-^s Mabel Ab
bott, who lias jti«t come to Tacoma to write for The
Times. From now on she is to lie a regular member of
our staff.
Miss Abbott is the foremost woman reporter on the
coast, and her work is going to be <|tiite an important
feature of this paper.
J wouldn't speak with such certainty about a new comer
were it not for the fact that it has been my good fortune to
work with her on another paper iv another city.
Miss Abbott has had much interesting newspaper and
other experience. She served as private secretary in Se
attle, for example, to Jacob Furih, former head of the
Stone t_v Webster interests in the Northwest, and as pri
vate secretary in Washington. I). C., to Samuel 11. Piles
during two years he was a United States senator.
More recently she was a valued member of the Seattle
Sun staff, ami has written also for the Seattle I\-1. antl
the Star.
During the last year she has been devoting much of her
time to magazine writing, ami articles and short stories
of her authorship have appeared in the American. Argosy
ami Mtinseys.
\ot in minutes ago. while opening her mail. Miss
Abbott asked me if an editor could keep a secret. I
promptly told her yes.
Thereupon she let me look at a check. It came in an
envelope from an eastern publisher ami called for an
amount that took my breath away.
I wish 1 hadn't been so quick with that promise, because
1 certainly sin mid like to tell you the amount and the
signer of that slip of paper. Anyhow, if you read the
current magazines you will see one of these days the story
lor which it was sent.
Mitt Abbott is going In be more than a reporter for The
'rimes. She is going to be olso on assistant editor whose
duly it sholl be to see that the woman s viewpoint is given
■ full recognition.
Most newspapers are etlitetl exclusively by men and
written almost exclusively by men, ami the writers and
-and the Lady Acknowledges It
By Mabel Abbott
The editor says it is absolutely nec
essary to acknowledge an introduction,
no matter how embarrassed one may
be; so, though my typewriter stutters
xvith confusion, 1 hasten to do the
proper thing.
• * * *
Being introduced to a large part of
a whole city-full of people at once is
an ordeal. Yet 1 am most awfully
anxious to know the city.
This is for two reasons.
One is practical. It Is inconvenient
to be unable to find one's xvay around
the block without consulting two po
licemen and a car conductor.
Yesterday I spent half an hour try
ing to get from The Times office, cor
ner ttk and Commerce, to tho office
of Franklin Fogg, the preparedness
parade man, at ill South 10th.
I hunted up and down Commerce
street, where 10th ought to he but was
not; I faced that impenetrable row of
buildings desperately, and at last, un
able either to crawl through, climb
over or burrow under. 1 went around
and found 10th street hiding on the
other Bide.
The other reason is personal, and

perhaps, petty.
The city has dared me.
It happened the first day I came. It
had been raining, and things did look
rather gloomy. The city rose before
me, terrace on terrace, to its spired
sky-line, and 1 stootl at the bottom, bur
dened with a suitcase, a typewriter
anil an umbrella, and looked up.
The city stared at me coldly, indif
ferently, out of its myriad window-eyes,
and I stared back with passionate in
terest.
"What,'' said the city, in a voice
made up of the rattle of traffic, the
roar of steamboat xvhfstles, the hum
of tideflat Industry and the chime of.
bells, "are you doing here"
"1 am a reporter," said I. speaking
boldly to cover my nervousness. "I
have come to work on The Times, one
of your clever newspapers. I am very,
very anxious to know you."
"Humph!" snorted the city. "What
do you want to know me for"
"Hecause," said I, a little netled,

have a personality, elusive, mysterious,
fascinating.

Kerry Season Opens.
They are celebrating the open
ing of the berry season.
Pnyallup Valley lives, prospers
and has become famous by its
berries. The berry business of
the Pnyallup Growers' associa
tion, according to W. H. Paul
hamus, Its head, amounted last
year to $1,500,000.
Six hundred thousand crates of
fresh berries alone went out to
all parts of the Pnited States, bs
sides the products of the cannery.

A liberal estimate of the nor

would be 20,000.

weeks sn additional temporary
population of 10.000. This in
