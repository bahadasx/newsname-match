OUT FORl OFFICE
During the past week or ten days
a number have announced for office
on both Denocratic and Republican
tickets and it is understood that
there will be a number more come on
for office on the democratic ticket.
It looked for a time that there would
be little doing in the way of county
politics this summer, but they have
been thoroukhily wvoke up by the re
cent national conventions and it
promises to b~e a warmi time both at
the primaries and the fall election.
George C. Russell of Saco, is the
first to announce for assessor on the
Republican ticket, and anything that
can be done for his candidacy will he

lived in what is now Phillips county
for the past six years and proved oip
on a claim in the vicinity of Love
Joy. For the past tew years he has
bad charge of an elevator at Saco

portance. Mir. Russell would make
a good assessor and in event of his
being elected lhe wvould.,give one and
all a fair and just assessment.
Thepeole f Pillpscounty will
needn in0troduto to Mi~arvin
Jones, who is a candidate for the
office of sheriff on the Republican'
Iticket. Mr. Jones was here long be-!
tore there was such a county as:
Phillips thought of and- has friends'
in every section of the county who
I will be found working for his nomn
Iination and election. For years he
was one of the prominent sheep men
of the country and since the country;
has been taken up for farming pur
poaces lie lies fallen in line and is one
of the sturdy farmers of the south
beniclh. Marvin is a good man for l
the office and will (doubtless receive
a handsome vote at the primaries in
August.
:Hiss Ayer, who has announced as
a candi~date for county superintend
ent of schools, came to Malta from
South Dakota wihere she. graduated
from the state university and during'
her residenice in Malta has been ono
of tin teachers in the public schiools
and has given universal satisfaction.
Only recently shte resigned her posi
tion as teacher to make the race for
the office of county superintendent.
She is one of the young ladies who
has a clatin on the north bench and
has wade many friends in bot~h the
country and town who will work for

schools in the resignation of Miss
Ayer, loses one of its hest teachers.
Henry L. Wolfe is a candidate for
the office ot county attorney on the
D~emocratic ticket to succeed him
self. Mr. Wolfe came to Malta
when the county was created, from
Glasgow and was appointed to the
office of county attorney shortly af
ter the resignation of Dennis Mc
Grath. Mr. Wolfe has been a very
paistkin oficaland has at all
timcs workedl for the interests ol
the county. It is very doubtful if
ho will have any opposition at the
primaries on the ticket on which he
is running and should hie land the
office for a second term it is a sure
thing that hie will pot forth his best
efforts to serve the people of the
coon ty.
'!he office of sheriff of Phbillips
county is one sougbt after by many
at the primaries, as will be seen by
tbe announcements and among
those is Ike Niebaur from Dodson,
who is a candidate for that oifice on
the Republican ticket at the primnar
ies in August. Before Phillips coon
ly was created Mr. Niebaur ltved in
Blailie county and served as sheriff
of that county for one terms and dur
big his time in office gave the people
of Bilaine county a good officer and
bie is one of the best known mien
in the county and has numerous
friends who would be well pleased
to see himt land the nomination.
Miss Flora Sims is a candidate
for the office of county superintend
ent of schools to succeed herself and
is probahly one of the best known
ladies in Phillips county, hoth
among the voter-4 and the patrons of
the various schools. She served as
county superintendent two terms in
Valley county before Phillips was
cut oft and was the only candidate
for that office at the creation of the
county. She has done a great (teal
for the betterment of the schools
during her term in office. Shie has
