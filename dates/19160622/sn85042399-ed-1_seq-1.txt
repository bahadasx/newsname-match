Protesting
The Recall
We, the undersigned, citizens and
residents of the city of Ashland, here
by declare our most earnest protest
against the stigma and deep disgrace
to he fastened upon our city by the
effort to recall Mr. Bert R. Greer
from the Springs Water Commission.
We believe it to be an effort that
will prostitute public honor for the
purpose of gratifying personal spite
and revenge.
We condemn the use of the recall
for any such purpose. If the grounds
set forth in the petition were suffi
cient at any time to justify a recall,
that time has wholly passed.
Mr. Greer Initiated the project and
by bis courage and persistency
brought it to the state of perfection
which has made Ashland known and
applauded all over the country. This
great consummation has become the
personal pride of ever ycitizen of this
city and valley. No one would wil
lingly consent that It should be taken
away from us. A great celebration,
financed at great expense, Is to be
held on July 4th, 5th and 6th, ex
pressly for the purpose of dedicating
this great work with panoply and
pomp, and an election called to recall
the man who put It through, to be
held one week before the celebration
of the work, is to begin. Can anyone
Imagine a more Incongruous situa
tion? Even without considering Mr.
Greer at all, the citizens of Ashland
should see that the honor and good
name of this city Is at stake, and
should rebuke its calumniators by an
overwhelming vote. There "has never
been such an occasion for Ashland's
heaviest vote. It should be a per
sonal matter with every voter.

As to Duryea's
Criticism
Some criticism of Mr. Greer by M.
J. Duryea Is given space In the last
issue of the Ashland Record. It may
suffice to say that Mr. Duryea was
preemptorlly discharged by the com
mission on evidence of his utter dis
loyalty In that he was working with
those opposed to the commission, In
fomenting public sentiment, we
think, with the view of bringing
about the recall of Mr. Greer, and
having himself elected In his place.
After he was preemptorily dismissed
lie begged of the commission that he
be allowed to resign In order that a
discharge might not stand against
him when he sought employment else
where. His request was granted by
the commission for that reason alone.
Therefore It Is not surprising that he
utters such strictures against the
commission.
Mrs. V7. L. Moore and Mrs. Charles
Holmes were trading with our mer
chants on Tuesday.

Special Train Will
Bring Portlanders
A special trainload of prominent
Portlauders seems assured for the
big Dedication celebration. The fol
lowing article from the Portland Tele
gram indicates some live boosting on
the part of Mr. Mulit, a former Ash
lander, John M. Scott, of the S. P.,
and one of the best friends of the
Ashland project, and other Portland
ers: '
Participation of Portland people In
the Fourth of July celebration by
which Ashland will open Lithla park
and its big resort project Is regarded
as a means of cementing the relations
between the northern and southern
sections of Oregon. Letters are going
out today inviting the members of
the Chamber of Commerce to join
the excursion which will leave Port
land at 8:15 on the evening of July
3. All other Southern Oregon towns
have dropped their plans for the 4th
to co-operate with Ashland In mak
ing known the virtues of her mineral
waters and the conveniences arrang
ed for the visitor.
Lloyd L. Mulit, John M. Scott, F.
E. Smith, C. W. Robinson and John
E. Cronan constitute the committee
handling the special train.
Early Forest
Fires Raging
A pall of smoke hung over the val
ley all the latter part of last week
and was only dispelled by the rain
1 of Saturday. It was caused by early
j forest f!res, several of which have
I been reported. A blfi fire near Sta-
son, Cal., called out 250 men and the
S. P. fire train and was finally put
under control Saturday.
A fire has been raging In the
Evans creek section for several days
and several are reported from Jose
phine county.
A fire started Fridav on the other
side of the Siskiyou su-.JBilt anl hnh
burned over several acres of tae H'.Jt
Lumber company's t'mir.
The fire wardens anl forest rang
ers have all been sea: on to their
stations.
Former Mayor .
EndorsesTGreer
I do not understand how any one
In Ashland can vote in favor of the
recall of Bert R. Greer, after he has
neglected his own affairs and spent
his time and energy to put this won
derful mineral springs water In the
grand Lithla Park, where the public
can help themselves.
Some say he wanted his own way
too much. That Is the kind of a man
It requires to do things. A man with
sufficient force of character does not
change his plans every time a body
kicks. We got what we voted for.
What more do we want? Do we want
to Insult the man who has given the
springs to us? No, we do not. The
Insult would be a stigma to Ashland
and the springs project forever.
It Is an easy matter to find fault
with a job of this kind after it Is
done, that it could have been done
differently, cheaper, etc. After the
details have been worked out and we
know exactly what he have to con
tend with, it is an easy matter to crit
icise. I have lived in Ashlnad for
thirty years aud have heard the pos
sibilities of the mineral springs spok
en of many times, but there was no
one energetic and public spirited
enough to undertake such a vast
project until Mr. Greer came along
and undertook it for us. Don't make
him feel sorry that he was public spir
ited enough to work for the benefit
of us all by voting him out now that
his task is complete. If we did we
would be guilty of the unpardonable
crime of ingratitude.
Now If everyone will take an in
terest as they should, I am not at all
afraid of results.

II. (',. Enders, through per
sonal spite. Councilman Banta,
because Mr. Greer supported
Mr. Johnson Instead of Banta
for mayor two years ago, C. B.
Wolf, through competitive riv
alry, have drummed up charges
against Mr. Greer and caused
a petition to be signed for a re
call election which will be held
next Monday.
Through innuendo and false
statements they have attempted
to prejudice the people against
me.
For nearly three years T have
worked honestly and faithfully
for you In forwarding the
springs enterprise. I admit mis
takes Biich as are common to
the average business man in a
new undertaking of the kind,
but I Btand with a clear con
science". I have done the best
I could.
I do hot expect after this serv
ice that the people of Ashland
will turn me down. I do not
think you will do It. Enders
and Wolf, In their recall, have
charged misappropriation of
funds, Incompetency and graft.
If you vote against me, you say
you believe I am guilty of this
and brand me dishonest for the
rest of my days.
I have faith in the people of
Ashland, and believe I fully
merit your confidence.
I rest my case with you. I
hope a full vote will be polled.
I feel sure if you all attend the
polls and vote your sentiment,
I will be vindicated by a large
majority. BERT R. GREER.
Reed Allows Use of
Name on Recall
M. C. Reed, pastor of the Methodl3i
church of Talent and Ashland real
estate man, has given permission to
have his name used on the Greer re
call petition as a candidate for com
missioner. Mr. Reed stated that
"while I sincerely believe and hope
that I will not be elected, I am allow
Ing my name to be used merely so
that this recall buBineM, which Is In
Juring the town, can oe disposed of,"
but, at the same time, he Is workln?
tooth and nail for the p.'ace. Yester
day he spent a large part of tho day
canvassing railroad men.
Carl Newburg of Klamath Falls is
visiting his aunt, Mrs. Joe Rader of
Phoenix, this week.

If Greer is guilty of pecula
tion, as lenders and Wolf insin
uate, why do they not sue Greer
on his liond? He has a $10,000
bond on file with the city guar
anteeing that he will administer
his office with honesty and
fidelity. If he has not done that
the full amount can be recov
ered from the bonding com
pany. The truth is Enders has
no proof and is relying on public
prejudice Instead of legal meth
od. He thinks by llelng and In
nuendo he can arouse prejudice
enough to defeat Greer. He has
left no stone unturned to vent
his spite and spleen against
Greer without the least founda
tion for his contention.
What will the good citizens of
Ashland do about It.
THE ELECTION WILL BE
HELD NEXT MONDAY.

To H. G. Enders
In reply to Mr. Enders' reference
to goods sold by us to the city of

Mr. Enders may have overlooked
some of the items furnished by us,
