A "Revival"
Spring is a time of revival. The grass, the trees,
the flowers, that had been withered and seemed dead,
all spring into new life. They live again. That is the
meaning of the word "revival" living again.
Now the Christian people of Berea have appointed
a Spring-time. They have asked Doctor Lamar to come
and help them think of the things of religion. They
know that if they think of religion they will begin to be
affected by religion, as the world is affected in Spring
time by the sun. '
We shall realize again that God loves us. We shall
take courage again to live as He wants us to live. We
shall begin to pray. We shall acknowledge the truth.
We shall make allowances for one another and actually
come to love our neighbors as we love ourselves. Let's
plan to get the full benefit of the revival !
Fight for Our Homes
The great political parties have this year put wo
man suffrage into their platforms.
This was not because the great men of the Repub
licans and Democrats believe that putting women into
politics will benefit the women, or anybody else, but be
cause they wanted to get rid of the pestering of the suf
fragists. Neither party intends to carry out that plank
of the platform. But all the same it does advertise the
suffrage idea.
Let us look at that idea.
Civilization has proceeded thus for on the. idea that
the family is the unit in the State. Each wife rules in her
home, and she is represented in the government by her
husband and her other men folks. And this representing
of the women folks has been one of the stimulating duties
of men.
The suffragists say,'"We won't trust our men folks
to represent us. We won't try to influence our sons and
brothers and husbands; we'll coerce them by the vote."
So suffrage dissolves the family and makes the in
dividual the unit in the State every man and every wo
man out for number one.
ICach wife is to be solicited to oppose her husband
in politics. Each girl is to be brought up with the idea
that to hold some office is the big thing in life.
Many other things now tend to destroy the family.
People hesitate to form a union for life, and so make
marriage only a temporary partnership. We recently
said to one of the great suffragists, "How will suffrage
affect the family?" The reply was, "The family is de
stroyed already."
Every husband who was married on the present basis,
who took a wife on the understanding that she elected
hhn to be her representative in political affairs, has a
right to sue the suffragists for alienating his wife's affec
tions. No doubt people can live without matrimony.
Many people have done so. But we believe the best
life is in the natural home, in which the man and the wo
man are equal, but each with his and her peculiar duties.
Where there are such homes the children will be the best.
And the nation in which women play their part as wo
men will be the strongest nation. We believe that suf
frage is "a reform against nature," and propose to fight
for the old-fashioned home.
WHAT CARLYLE SAYS ABOUT IT:
" Duties high, noble, silently important as any that
can fall to a human creature, duties that, if well dis
charged, constitute woman in a soft, beautiful, almost
sacred way, ueen of the World, and which, by her
natural faculties, graces, strength and weaknesses, are
every way indicated as esjH'cially hers."

WORLD NEWS
RUSSIANS STILL ADVANCE
The Russian war office reports
that in the last thirteen days 170,
000 prisoners have fallen into their
hands. The forward drive of the
Russian armies in Volhynia, Galicia,
and Mukowina has not yet met with
effective opposition, and the Aus
trians are rapidly falling baca.
Czcrnnwitz, a very important Aus
trian city, has fallen into the Czar's
hands, despite the desperate
resistance offered by Its defenders.
This Russian drive seems to have
relieved the pressure of the German
forces on the French fortress of
Verdun, since it is reported from
Petrograd that many German troops
liave been taken from the western
front lo aid the Austrians in the'r
defense of Galaria. The French
report that all the German attacks
on Verdun have been successfully
repulsed with great losses to the
Teutons.
From London ioiiie word c? the
loss of one Spanish end two British
ships. It is also reported th., f -oin
the uniforms of do id Germans, it has
been ascertained thnt young nion of
the 1917 cl is have been called into
active service. This means that lads
of seventeen are being forced to
take their part in Germany's cam

of men among the Kaiser's troops.
