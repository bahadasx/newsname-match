Freight Wreck on High
Line on Sunday Morning
Sunday morning at 8:45 a disastrous
freight train wreck occurred on the
N/ P. high line two miles west of this
city. A long freight train, east bound
with two engines, was rounding a
curve when evidently the rails spread
and the two large engines, Nos. 1900
and 1904, went into the ditch. Two
ancient box cars were smashed up,
while two refrigerator cars, on either
side -were practically unharmed,.- The
train, was in charge of Qonductor Burr,
and the engines were driven by Ed.
Seeberg and Ed. Stearns. The en
gineers and firemen escaped by jump
ing. The tender of one engine was
thrown against the supports of the
wagon bridge over the track at the
point where the wreck occurred, and
it is a wonder it did not wreck the
bridge.
A call has been issued by Captain
D. S. Ritchie for volunteers to enlist
for service in the militia. One of the
absent members of Company wired
from Powers Lake to count on his ser
vices. Joe Underwood, of Eiiderlin,
phoned for enlistment and arrived on

ESTABLISHED 1«7ft
"The Fire Called Eternal" was the
subject of Dr. L. T. Guild, of Fargo,
who delivered the annual senior ser
mon before the class of 1916 at the
State Normal school Sunday evening.
By "fire eternal" the speaker meant an
ideal such as allows one to discrimin
ate between those who accomplish and
crfeate and those who do not. He men
tioned many of the great lights of his
tory and showed that the ideals for
which they labored make them known
for all time.
Live for a high purpose, know that
you are right and labor diligently was
the theme that Dr. Guild powerfully
brought to the mind of the members of
the class, whose profession he called
all the more important now that "the
family altar has become a curiosity"
and many of the former duties of the
home have been shifted to the school.
Dr. Guild delivered the sermon Sun
day evening in place of Dr. Theodore
Kemp, who was unable to come to Val
ley City at the last minute. President
McFarland presided and Rev. Willard
Crosby Lyon assisted with the ser
vices. A double quartet, consisting of
Mrs. Knute Froysaa, Miss Elizabeth
Clark, Mrs. ,M. C. James, Mrs. W. T.
Craswell and Messrs. McMullen, Hunt,
Stevenson and Meyer, sang "For He
Shall' Give His Angels Charge Over
Thee" from Mendelssohn.
Following the sermon the Misses
Marguerite Rae, Mertice Aldahl and
Louise Bublitz sang "Lift Thine Eyes,"
also from "Elijah."
The class of 1916, numbering 218
members, occupied seats in the center
section of the auditorium. Several of
the churches of the city made this ex
ercise a union service and the hall waB
comfortably filled.
Valley City Man Was

After the ceremony the bridal party

low ribbon streamers which were ex
tended from the chandelier. A show
er of ribbon with bow-knots was drap
ed from the chandelier. The center
piece was yellow rosebuds and ferns..
During the courses Bernifee Shearer
played softly the strains of "Hearts
and Flowers." After the luncheon
Frank Shearer rendered the solos,
"For You" and "I Love You, Dear" ac
companied by Bernice Shearer.
