THE REASON WHY.
Why is It thai HATSON & WEST

GOODS SO CHEAP!
BECAUSE they buy for CASH and sell

BECAUSE they take all discounts.
BECAUSE they have the lowest rent.
BECAUSE they have no clerks to pay.
BECAUSE they do their own work.

GOOD MASONIC WORK.
Some of the most interesting work
ever seen in the local Masonic lodge
was seen here on last Thursday night,
the 16th. when a team came down from
Carlisle, Ky and conferred the M. M,
degree on Rev, P. M. Tinder, Rev. A.
J, Clere and Dr. Prydr. The team was
headed by Past Grand Master, Sam K,
Veatch and carried with it several
splendid voices, which being added to
by some of our local talent, made the
music one of the most Interesting
feature of the work.
Carlisle is Bro. Tinder'a old home.
and several of the crowd came especially
on his account, to use their own lan
guage, Bro. Tinder having tierformed
the marriage ceremony for them years
ogo, they "wanted to get even with
him."
The crowd was composed of the fol
lowing gentlemen: P, G, M Sam
K. Veatch. Dr. G. B. Spenser, G. II.
Fisher, T. E. Mulchings. Dudley Spen
cer, Taylor Mathers, I, B. Ross, L. A.
Martin, Perry McClannahsn. Wra,
Roberts, II, R. Ewing, John P, Mor
gan and Harvey Norton.
The crowd came through In auto
mobiles, and was composed of the lend
Ing'business and professional men of
Carlisle, The work was put on in a
most beautiful and impressive manner,
some of the number being members of
tbbest degree teams of the Masons in
me eiaie.

PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON.
A sterling and unconquerable ticket has again been named to lead the
Democrats to victory. Woodrow Wilson has been renominated as the Standard
bearer of this greul iarty. His motto has been "To Maintain Our National
Honor by Peace If we Can, by War if we Must." Believing In peace, and be
lieving in efficiency of armament to preserve pence. President Wilson has taken
a strong stand In fovor of preparedness. During his administration the pros
perity of the country has Increased 21 per cent and wages 64 per cent. His
administration has constantly devoted Itself to the stimulation of industry and
agriculture.
'INWANA STILL IN
DOUBT" TO BE REVIVED
Many years ago Indiana was one of
several states which formed a pivot up
on which presidential elections hinged.
This yar with both vice presidential
candidates to her credit, the hoosier
sta'.e ajraln bids fair to become the
battle ground. Both Marshall and
Fairbanks are from Indiana, and with
two United States Senators to be
elected, the fight will be fast and
furious, and with the coming Novem
ber election the old time election cry of
"Indiana still In doubt" will probably
once again be liberally Interspersed
with the election returns.
HAS BAD LUCK WITH
TRACTION ENGINE.
Mr. Joshua Hurt, who operates two
threshing outfits, started one of his
large traction engines from Lancaiter
to take another engine to Mr, Leslie
Bradshaws Mills in Madison county.
When near Teatersville the engine
went through a bridge; this occurred
on Monday and two days was consumed
in raising the engine. On the return
trip to the home of Mr. Hurt on Back
Creek near Point Leavel', the engine
went through the bridge near the West
place on the Kfrksville pike, again re
quiring two days to extricate it.
Luckily no one was injured by either
accident, and the engine was not suf
ficiently damaged to prevent its taking
out a threshlr-g outfit with the opening
of the season. The county sustained
considerably expense by-the destruction
of two culvert bridges.
ZACK SIMPSON OF SPOON-
VILLE KILLED BY HIS

SEBASTIAN.

MEETING OF THE STATE
DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE
J. E. Robinson, a member of the
State Executive Committee, is In Louis
ville this week attending a meeting of
the committee called for the (impose of
organizing the campaign for the Nov.
ember election. It is the purpose of
the party to make one of the most ag
gressive fights ever made In Kentucky
with the. view of getting President Wil
son a pronounced majority from Ken
tucky. It is the hope of the leader of
the party that this State set the pace
for the other States of the Union in or
ganization, which can easily be done on
account of the party being so thorough
ly united in its desire for the reelection
of President Wilson. Work will be
bgun at once to perfect the organiza
tion of the party in the State.
BUILDING AND RUMORS
OF BUILDING.
Lancaster for the past several years
has experienced a steady growth, both
In population and in the building line.
Every year a number of new residences
go up in and about the town. This
year is no exception to tho rule as sev
eral neat and inure or less pretentious
houses are under course of construction
However there may be expecteil a lib
eral Increase along the building line In
the near future, as the builder follows
closely upon the heels of Cupid as a
usual thing; several of the recently
wedded couples have already purchased
lots, while others, are busy seeking
locations, and we may expect to see
them all comfortably located in new
homes bafore the snow fifes again.
COLORED PEO
PLE "RALLYING."
The colored people of the community,
to judge from their recent actions, are
determined to release their church
property from all debts by which it has
been encumbered. There seems to be
a friendly spirit of co-operation be
tween the two denominations, Baptist
and Methodist, for a few weeks ago
the former held a big "rally" at which
the latter assisted, as a result of which
their treasury was considerably flushed;
and in turn the Baptists "came over
into Macedonia" and returned the
favor, and at a monstrous gathering or
"rally" last Sunday at the Methodist
church, in which numoerof prominent
divines from distance, including a
colored Bishop, took; part, sufficient
funds were raised to raise a two hun
dred dollar mortgage upon the colored
parsonage. .
