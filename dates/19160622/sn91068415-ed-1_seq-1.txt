HAS
Sereral Important Matters That Have
Been StreDuoasIy Advocated by This
Paper BaYft Been Crowned With Yic-
:the Review tries to "hew to the
lineand let the chips fall where they
will in all matters for the good of
the public and of course is gratified
to note that its efforts have been
rewarded in many ways.
It's" the mission of a newsDaner to
stand for a "principle not men;" It
taxes nerve m the beginning, be
cause of a fear of "hurting business"
but in the long run you win out
against the bugaboo "for policy's
sake," which has been the downfall
of many a newspaper which tried
to serve the interests instead of the
people. -
The Review is pleased to note
that there is to be an inspection of
themeat and milk supply. v
That the unsightly and unsani
tary push carts or, street vendors
have been tabooed.
That the- health department is
paying close attention to ihe proper
screening and handling of food pro
ducts. That Carter Dalton goes to the
legislature from High Point and will
be instrumental in giving the legis
lation desired and needed to over
come the present state of affairs.
These are some of the things the
Review hafs espoused and worked
diligently for and will continue to
keep up the fight for better govern
ment, better health and a better
Hieh Point in general.
What Partisan Politics Does
for a City.
High Point' is the lauging stock
for the people over the state as re
gards petty politics- iu the city
Council over various interests aftect
jng the; welfare; of k ttm cicv" which
f iobts to" ttle ontsideT that three in
dividuals are trying to rum the city.
And we must confess thatythe
editor of this paper is rather alarm
ed over trie matter because we
know that High Point's good name
has suffered and is suffering over
the very uuforiunate state of affairs,
made possible througn no fault of
the people, because the 1915 legis
lature thrust - the present existing
circumstances upon us without giv
us a chance as freemen to register our
opinion by naming the people who
would serve persona non grata for 2
years, or at least a majority of them
could not be elected by a vote of
the people.
We have recently traveled from
one end of the state to the other
and-this is about the first thing you
hear, after is learned that you are
from high Point. Just as sure as j
the night follows the day such J
things hurt a town and hurt it bad-1
iy. There's no use denying it, aud j
tnere snould be some way to stop
the "unfortunate affair" and save
ourselves from 'mine enemies" until
the people get a chance to put an
end to it at the polls.
Soldiers Called to Arms.
There was some little excitement
on the streets Sunday night when it
was learned that most of tne nation
al guardsmen had been called to
arms. Early Monday morning Capt.
Dallas Zollicoffer of the local mili
try company was getting his men
together in obedience to a demand
from headquarters and by night the
full quota was in hand. The soldier
boys marched up and down the
streets with serious but determined
faces while their wives and sweet
hearts realized that perhaps that it
would be a long time until they saw
their faces again! Most of the boys
seemed willing to go that's the
spirit of the Tar Heel, ready and
willing to answer a call to duty.
Of course the calling out of the
soldiers and their final disposition
was the topic of conversation here
all day Monday.
Large Number Conversions.
It is claimed that there were
over 200 conversions as a result of
the Black revival meetings which
came to a close Sunday night. Ap
portioned among the various de
nominations the 200 are: Method
ist Episcopate, 50; Presbyterians, 32,
Methodist Protestants, 17; Baptists,
40; Reformed, 11; Friends, 18;
Christian, 4; Episcopal, 3; Lutheran,
2; Primitive Baptists, 2; no prefer
ence expressed, 20. .

Tia editor spent a portion of last
week at Waynesville, 29 miles above
Asheville, nestled 2,000 'feet above
sea level and aL the foot of Junai
luska mountain, about 6,000 feet
high,, upon which is situated Eagle's
Nes, a very nice hotel owned by Mr
Satterthwait. - r
e Grand Lodge, Knights of
Pythias was in session at Wayries
ville Tuesday, Wednesday and Thurs
day; upon which the editor was in
attendance and before talking of
various inciderks ol the trip will dis
pose of this matter in; which many
of our readers are interested
Monday evening the organization
of the Grand Lodge was effected, ad
jouming at one o'clock in the morn
ing! Wednesdayand Thursday were
taken up altogether with business
of ibuch - importance to the order.
The election of officers -Thursday
morning re&uhed as follows: Grand
Chancellor, McBride Holt, of Graham;
vice-chancellor, Dr. Byron Clark of
Salisbury; Grand K. of R. & S., W.
T. .Hollo well, of Goldsboro; Gland

Grand Inner Guard, W. W. Branch,
of Rhodhi8s; Grand Outer Guard, G;
Hi. Guire, of Canton; Supreme Repre
sentative, Thos. H. Webb. There
were three towns in the race for
next 'meeting' placv High Point,
Rocky Mount and Clayton. After
the second vote Rocky Mount was
declared the winner.- The report
from, the Orphan's Home showed
that the children were receiving
eyerycare possible and that the
finances of the institution were in
fine inane. High Poi'it was amon
Mhe leading lodges iv regard to
remoedjgroVth the : past' yn-'8e$M3tst
up to Jan. 1. 1916 and third up to
June 1st. This covers about every
thing of interest to the reader in re
gard to the meeting.
Waynesville is a very pretty place
and a great summer resort, three or
four thousand visitors going there
in the months of July and August.
It is the home town of Geo. H
Crowell, at one time superintendent
of our schools. Mr. Crowell is now
financial agent of the great ' Metho
dist institution at Junaluska, three
miles from the city. Waynesville is
a town of some three thousand peo
ple and is located, of course, on the
several hills in the big mountain
basin or valley, a town of magnifi
cent distances. Eagle's nest, on the
crest of Junaluska mountain, is a
very attractive spot and is at an
altitude of over 6,000 feet. This is
the home of Miss Lucile Satterthwait
declared by the moving world in the
"Brains and Beauty" contest to be
one of the five prettiest women in
the world. This pretty little product
of North Carolina is now in New
York City taking training for the
movies in which she is to receive
nearly a quarter of a million dollars
a year from getting into the limelight.
The story goes that she entered the
contest without eveu telling her
parents, in fact the mother told our
party this while there. Miss Satter
thwait determined to try to meet the
requirements both as to brains and
beauty and she won both. At the
time she weighed 140 pounds but
the requirements called for 125
pounds, and that was easy, dieting
herself on milk until her weight was
reduced, tu'eh" with the proper appli
cation of lotions she put herself in
the pink of condition and if you will
look at her or her picture you will
readily, agree.that North Carolina has
the greatest beauty in the world.
"Father" has not exactly consented
as yet to her entering the movies but
"mother" talks suspiciously like it is
going to end alright for her pretty
daughter and the stream of gold will
help to swel the already well-to-do
purse of the family.
We were located at the White
Sulphur Springs, a delightful spot,
with fine sulphur water, plenty of
good rations, comfortable beds, etc.,
and our stay was made very pleas
ant. A side trip was taken to Canton,
the home of the great Canton Fibre
and Pulp Mills, the largest in the
world, where paper pulp is made
from chestnut and pine lumber. It
would take your breath to tell ho w
many, hundreds of cords, how many
hundreds of tons of coal, how many
hundreds of cars of pulp and lum
ber ar used and shipped weekly
but it is enormous. And yet the
pulp, business is really a by product,
because all of . the best timber . is
saved for. lumber, demanding a
higher price, while the slabs and
culls are made into pulp. It is one
of the most complete plants you ever
saw. The payroll is about $50,000
weekly. We watched the making
of the paper pulp from the time the
log was started on its journey until
it was placed in the car for ship
ment; first it is cut up into fine chips,
then turned into the great boiling
vats, then run through the chemi'
cals for bleaching purposes, carded
on great rolls, run through the dry
ing rollers to the cutting machines.
The company had its own hosipitai
within the building and 'safety first"
seems to be the motto.
The trip to Junaluska and a ride
on the lake and through the mam-,
moth Methodist building and over
the grounds afforded a two hours
pleasure never to be forgotten.
A stop off at Marion to see our
mother revealed the fact that Marfon
is pushing forward in many ways
and is destined to be a town of
much larger population within a few
years.
Changing the subject and talking
about that which interests every one
of caring, we can tell you a place to
get the best lunch for 25c in the
world, and that is at Connelly Springs
and old man Wm. Jeff Davis, the
proprietor, has become famous
through the hotel lunches he sells to
the hungry journeyers as the' train
stops ac the depot. Why man you
get plenty of chicken, hath; egg sand
wiches, pickles, cake and other ex
tras and for our lives we can't see
how Davis does it, but he does. Per
haps this is one way he chooses to
advertise. If one gets so much for
a quarter what will he get at the
hotel proper is thejnatural conclusion
one reaches. - ' ;
But enough for this time.

There was much excitement.
You Can Show Yoar Patri
otism. We notice where the Durham
Hosiery-Mills is going to do the right
thing by the soldier boys. Those
who were employed in their mills at
Durham, High Point; Chapel Hill,
GoMsboro and Mebane who have
been called to the colors will
receive the same pay as if at work, j
minus that part the government
pays in other words full pay and
the difference the. company will pay
te wife or dependent ones of said
soldier. r
This is a nne spirit anu snows
that while we all can't fight we can
be patriotic and contribute to our
country's defense in this way. High
Point concerns could well afford to
follow this, very commendable
course.

Councilmen Terr y and
Smith's Letter.
Councilmen Terry and Smith did
I the right thing in remaining on the
prhciar Board even if they are in
the minority on every matter in
which the city is interested, because,
the "law' does, not provide for the
filling of a vacancy by a vote of the
people. k -
Perhaps they can yet accomplish
some good things by sticking and
protesting, to help the town. Any
way it is better than having all five
of the same opinion as the three
that now constitute the majority.
That was a very fine expression in
the letter of Messrs. Terry and
Smith: "We believe in an economi
cal administration of public matters
but will never cencede that there is
nothing more sacred than dollars."
The letter in full, addressed to the
citizens of High Point and signed by
Messrs. Terry and Smith, follows:
"To the Citizens of High Point:
"Inasmuch as our contemplated
resignation as members of the city
council seems to have been generally
discussed, and since, after reconsid
eration, the same has been with
drawn, justice to ourselves compels
a public statement of our position.
"After taking the oath of office as
councilmen we .determined, and
have ever-tried, to serve the citi
eens to the best of our ability; and
have always favored and fought for
all measures tending for the better
ment and upbuilding of High Point
in ail of its departments.
. "We believe in an economical ad
ministration of public matters but
will never concede that there is
nothing more sacred or important
than dollars. In the beginning of
this administration we fought with
all the vigor at our command
against dividing the different de
partments of the city and putting
the school system under the person
al supervision of one of (be council
men, and from day until, this an ef
fort was made by some members of
the council to make it unpleasant
for the supeautendegt - of pur city
chools-"wtulr - finally wlfli -an! ally
of the same mind,1 caused in our
opinion, the result that followed.
"Being hopelessly in the minority
on questions of public interest, we
felt it best for us to resign so that
the majority might carry out their
policies without the van protest of
the minority. Please understand
and we wish to emphasize this point
that our action was not the result
of any particular difference of opinion
on any one matter, but at all times
an i on all questions of public interest
our presence has caused an utter
lack of harmony and has mace con
certed action impossible.
"Our resignations have been with
drawn for several reasons; First:
Because our successors under the
charter, could not be elected by the
people, but would be chosen by the
remaining three members of the
council, which would practically
mean that a majority of those re
maining on the council could select
men who were in strict accord with
their views, a condition which to our
minds would preclude the people
' who hold ideas
with us of even the
ririvilege of making a protest, futile
though it miht be, against any ac
tion which in our opinion would tend
to retard the proper development of
the city.
"Second: Because our duty to our
friends and the public will hot allow
us to do otherwise than to "stick it
out" and keep up our feeble fight for
measures which we think essential
to High Point's welfare.
4We recognize that no condition
can justify the government of a city
not elected by its citizens, and we
stand ready to resign our positions
whenever our resignations are asked
for by the people of High Point. Un
lif that time comes, or until' our.
term of office expires, we have .de
cided to stay on the jpb and do
everything; in . our powerlittle
though it may be to
advance the
hpst interests of High Point
and its
De0Die. In doing this we have laid
jaside our personal choice in the
malter, and will ever stand for those
tnings that we think the citizens of
Hign Point demand.
First Car Yesterday. .
The first electric car between
High Point and Thomasville made
the trip yesterday. The type of car
is ;a . "storage battery" which is
charged when needed. The sched
ule calls for 30 minutes between , the
towns and the fare is 15c. A heavy
car is used which is roomy and
comfortable. Six round trips are
made daily.
