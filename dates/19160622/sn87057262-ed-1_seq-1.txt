The Carrazil clash between the
Mexican government and American

American expedition's heaviest losses
to date, gave ground for this view
officially.
General Pershing's report remained
the confirming factor. It was due

The me&a overlooking Juarez bristled
with a battery of the big 4.7 Inch
American guns.
Prom reports received by state de
partment agents, mining companies
and the Carranzista officials here, It
appears that five troops of the Tenth
cavalry were on scout duty near
Carrizal when they were discovered
by Carranzista outposts. These Mex
ican troopers hastened back to the
hamlet. General Felix Gomez, com
manding the defacto troops in the
town, ordered machine guns secreted
on the roofs of houses and hid 'nls
men behind adobe walls. A small
company of Mexicans was sent to
the western part of the town to wave
Qag of traoe. The- unsuspecting
American cavalrymen rode into the
ambush. When the Mexicans opened
fire from their- machine Irons, the
negro troopers fought back like
fiends. General Gomez was killed,
his 'body literally riddled with Amer
ican bullets.
Forced to Retire.
The Americans charged the unseen
Mexicans in an effort to recapture
several of their number, and inflicted
heavy casualties, the unofficial re
ports stated. They were finally
forced to retire in the face of vastly
superior Mexican forces.
The American column was reported
to number five hundred, while Gomez
is believed to have had several thous
and men under his command.
The righting continued two hours,
the Carranzistas being meanwhile
reinforced from the large Carranzista
forces in Villa Ahumada.
Messages received here early to
day by mining companies said the
Mexican losses were double those
sustained by the American forces.
It was reported that General
Pershing has seized the Mexican
towns of Neuvo Casas Grandes and

those who would not Join it.
This convinced the administration
that it now can hope for nothing from
the first chief and his crumbling
power.
A few high officials counselled calm
until Pershing reported, pointing out
that information now before this gov
ernment is from Mexican sources.
Others were for wasting no time in
establishing an actual state of war.
No one professed seriously that
trouble can now be avoided.
Dispatch of the California, Missouri
and Kansas militia immediately to
the border was directed. This, it was
expected, would be followed by orders
to incompletely mobilized militia to
board fast troop trains for the boun
dary.
It seemed likely that all red tape
would be cut.
Before General Funston reported
the clash, last night officials said
doubtless would take two or three
weeks to complete mobilization, in
spection. vaccination, physical tests
and administration of the federal ser
vice.
"But if need arises, we can send
these forces out much fasixr, without
gathering them at concentration
points," an official said today.
President Wilson heard the news
gravely' at a midnight vigil in the
white house. He remained on duty
until border reports indicated Persh

He left instructions, however, that
any definite information be flashed

General Pershing has immediately
sent reinforcements to the Tenth

view of officials here.
General Gonzales issued a state

he received Information of an armed
force of unknown strength at Santo

Gomez to inform the American of

Carranzistas hold Carrizal today and
the Americans are camped in the
nearby foothills. The Americans
captured were transferred to Chi
huahua City under heavy guard, ac
cording to General Gonzales. A train
load of Mexican wounded also were
taken to the hospitals in the state
capital.
Indications today pointed to the
early evacuation of Juarez 'by the

Asked if Juarez would be evacu

MEXICO CITY, June 52.—General
Pershing's defiance of the instructions
given him by General Trevino to maka
no further advance intc Mexico
caused the battle at Carrizal station
on the Mexican Central railway, the
war office announced today.
The official statement reported the
battle occurred on Sunday, June 18.
The American forces ware moving
southward when the engagement oc
curred. They were driven back and
seventeen taken prisoners. General
Felix Gomez was fatally wounded and
died after the battle.
General Obregon's version of the
Carrizal clash was that the American
forces "tried to occupy the station of
Carrizal of the Mexican Central rail
way and General Trevino ordered it
to be attacked."

BIG CLASH IN MEXICO REPORTED

Increasingly Bad.
WASHINGTON, June 22.—In dis
patches sent to the war department
by General Funston early today, the
situation in northern Mexico was de
scribed as increasingly bad. Orders
issued by Carranza for arming of citi
zens is adding material to the anti
American feeling.
It is reported that Carranza has in
structed inhabitants of the republic
to "defend themselves in case of in
ternational war." This situation is
described by General Pershing in a
dispatch to Funston from Dublan,
Mexico, Tuesday and forwarded to
the state department last night.
Pershing's dispatch to Funston says:

attitude is as follows:
"Regarding President Wilson's re
fusal to withdraw troops—under the
terms of the order issued—sending
them into Mexico, their presence on
Mexican soil is no longer justified or
logical. The order from the head of
the American army distinctly stated
that the expedition's sole object wasj
the arrest or death of Villa and the
dispersal of his band. That "Villa is
