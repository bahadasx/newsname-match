gratitude to the many neighbors and
friends for their acts of kindness and

Commencement Night.
When the curtain rose at Central
hall on Thursday evening laBt week,
the scene disclosed to the crowded
room full of interested spectators was
very effective. Tho walls were hung
with ribbons of pink and green crepe
paper, the class colors, with a bank of
heavy greenery at the back and a mass
of ferns along the footlights.
Tho eighteen pretty girl graduates
all dressed in white, with the half doz
en young men interspersed to make
the right balance, sat in two semi circles.
Prof. Drouyor occupied a seat at one
end of the row and Prof. McKenuy, the
speaker of the evening, at the other.
The latter was introduced by the
superintendent in a timely little speech
and the audience settled down to listen
to the President of Ypsilantl Normal.
Ilia subject was "School and Life,"
and in a clear, plain, concise talk, he
evidenced his views in regard to the
necessity and value of education and
the immense Importance It tood for in
one's life. Prof. McKenuy is not a
brilliant or ilowery speaker, but his fine
personality holds his hearers to the
last word, and his last word is as good
and effective as his first, lie was well
liked and his address was considered
most excellent.
Diplomas were awarded the grad
uates by Mr. Drouyor in a few well
chosen words and with several selec
tions of music by McKanlass orchestra,
Commencement exercises were oyer
for another year.
Later the floor was cleared and the
evening prolonged with dancing until
one o'clock.
The commencement exercises of the
Eighth Grade Graduating class of the
ltoseburg Bchool was one that will long
be remembered by those who had the
pleasure of attending.
The exercises were neia in tne aiein-
odist church, which was crowded to
the limit by the many friends and rel
atives of the Class of 'IS.
The commencement address was de
livered with crreat eloquence by ltev.
J. O. Wood, of Brown City, assisted by
Hev. Tram, of Peck, rne suoject
was based on the class motto, "We
have left the bay; the ocean lies before
us." It was handled ably and well-
much valuable advice was given to the
graduates which will help them to re
alize the responsibilities of life and
the great opportunities which lie before
them.
After the address Anson Da foe, the
director, made some very pleasing re
marks, commending the graduates ana
teacher, Miss Wood, for the splendid
work accomplished during tne year,
after which he presented diplo
mas to Marie Wellman, Bernice Badley,
Uosetta Gingrich, Viola Herbert, John
W ebb and Lela ilinkley.
The colon were pink and white, the
color scheme being carried out in all
directions. The church was neauti
fullv decorated with Pink and white
crepe paper and pink and white flowers
in abundance. The girls were aresBea
in uniforms, the same being middy
blouses and pink ties and carried pink
and white carnations, the class flower.
After the presentation of diplomas
the entire audience joined in singing
our national hymn, "America," ana
Hev. Traver pronounced a very im
pre6slve benediction.
.Many were tne congratulations ana
best wishes which the graduates re
ceived as they embarked on the ocean
of life.
On Thursday tho class and teacher

Suggestions to Auto Drivers.
Marshal Ucnry requests the Exposi
tor to warn auto drivers to use caution
at all times. Speeding on the streets
of Vale is prohibited. Autos must
have not only the front lights lighted
at night, but the rear light also. Li
censes for 1916 must appear inconspic
uous places in both front and rear of
auto. When you expect to remain in
the city for a time, park your machines
on an angle to the curb about three
feet apart.
By keeping in mind always the sug
gestions mentioned above will save
being brought before a justice of the
peace and possibly being compelled to
pay a line.

Dear Friend James I see by your
paper that Yale is to have a Caledon
ian Day this year. 1 am very glad to
note that you are endeavoring to make
it a big success. I have spoken to a
number of Scotch people here and they
will all drive over, including our towns
man, Alex McConnachie, who has taken
a number of prizes for the best dressed
Kiltie.
Trusting it will be a big success, I
am, Yours very truly,

Work of County Agriculturist
The canning demonstrations that are
being held this week, cow testing as
sociation affairs, and miscellaneous
farm visits claimed attention last week.
While considerable rainy weather was
experienced, it was possible to get
about in six dinerent townsmps in tne
western and southern portions of the
county. Calls were made at the farms
of the following people: A. J. Smith
and William Campbell of Lynn town
ship; Albert Toscn, K. E. Cannis, F. A.
Potts. Albert Balden and llenry Pal
las, Mussey; George Berk and Wesley
Stringbam, Berlin; John Day, Frank
Foley and John judge, itiiey; Wesley
Boes, William Humphrey, B. J. Smith,
E. W, Lewis, Dr. Mudge and the
County Farm, Wales township.
An Interesting experiment has been
located on the farm of B. J. Smith of
Wales township, The Botanical De
partment of the Michigan Agricultural
College is carrying out a series of ex
periments in each of the 12 counties in
the state in connection witn bean dis
ease work. The plan Is to test the val
ue of Early wonder beans, laano
grown Michigan beans, and carefully
picked Michigan-grown beans, in the
control of bean diseases. Ten quarts
of seeds of each of these varieties are
furnished by the Department and will
be planted in the tield with the grow
er's own seed stock surrounding them
on two or three sides. Prof. Muncie
writes that It Is hoped that these ex
periments will prove (1) the superiority
of carefully picked seed from ordinary
seed, (2) the value of an early maturing
disease escaping variety sucn as tne
Early Wonder, (3) that the amount of
disease in the Held can be materially
decreased by using Idaho-grown Mich
igan seed.
It is also pleasing to know that
the Cow Testing Association is grad
ually spreading over the whole county;
and it cow has members in each of the
following townships: Lynn, Mussey,
Berlin, Wales, Kimball, Clyde, Fort
Gratiot, Grant, Burtchville, Port Hu
ron and St. Clair. The Association
was very glad to add the name of Geo.
Berk of Berlin township to its list of
members last week.
The next meeting of the Association
occurs on August 4th, and it would be
a splendid plan to hold it on the farm
of one of the members. While the
County Agent's oflke is open at all
times to such functions, It is believed
that a dairy farm will be found to fur
nish a more satisfactory environment
and add immeasurably to the pleasure
and profit of the occasion.
