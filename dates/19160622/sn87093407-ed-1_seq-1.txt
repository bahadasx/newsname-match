first blood of battle has been shed in Mexico. American soldiers have been slain. Whether it means

to enlist, this is the time—not tomorrow, or Saturday, or next week. The recruiting stations are at the
Armory, Western ave. and Lenora st„ and the store adjoining Cheasty's Haberdashery, Second and Spring.

ONE CENT
PRESIDENT MAY
ASK CONGRESS
TO BACK THREAT
WASHINGTON, June 22.—Until it it definitely
established that there is an organized effort by Carrantai
troops to attack or harass American forces in Mexico,
no change in President Wilson's policy is likely, callers
learned today.
The president is awaiting details of t'ne fight between
C arranza and American soldiers before planning his course.
At San .Vniurno, Ijcji. Kuu.-ton received a message today
from fien. Per-liing stating that Pershing had heard no re
port of the Carri7.ll battle except the one wired him by Gen.
ISell frnni F.l Paso.
Pershing said lie had dispatched a squadron of the Tenth
cavalry to investigate and would report as soon as he learns
anything officially.
1-unston said he would make no new until he hears
from Pershing.
It is believed here that Troop 11, Tenth cavalry, com
manded by t apt. Boyd, was engaged in the Carri/al fight.
White House Flooded With Inquiries;
Wilson Outlines His Attitude
The White Hou«e today was flooded with inquiries as.
to the situation A score of congressmen called to learn the
determination of the administration.
The president indicated clearly that if a change in policy
occurs it will result on the initiative of the Mexicans.
If a conflict i> found necessary a- a last resort, the presi
dent emphatically declared it would in no way be a war of
conquest.
It would simply be a vigorous effort to establish order
and peace iti the trouble-ridden country and then to return
it to its people, established on a sound foundation.
General invasion of Mexico appeared to hover ahead
today, however.
The ( arri/.al clash, apparently resulting in the American
expedition's heaviest losses to date, gave ground for this of
ficial view.
Dispatcher from Mexico City said today all blame was
laid on the American forces by the war office.
President May Ask Congress to Back
Him Up in Threat Against Carranza
Against the Mexican claim that tlie Americans were the
aggressors attempting to capture the railway station at Car
rizal, were placed border reports that the Americans were
merely reconnoitering and were led into anihush.
(ien. Funston will strengthen Pershing's column, it is
expected.
When President Wilson takes the case before congress
lie will ask, it is for appropriation and approval of the
drive into Mexico, in keeping with his threat to Carranza
to visit upon him "the grave-t consequences" if the de facto
forces clashed with Americans.
The last thought that l arranza is making serious effort
to check the inflamed passions of his people vanished today
when tien. Pershing forwarded a copy of orders, fostered by
Carranza, to resist the American crossing of the border and to
swell the Mexican army.
This convinced the administration that it now can hope
for nothing from Carranza and his crumbling power.
One of the biggest elements In
the entire situation Is the fact that
the Mexicans are reported to hold
a number of American soldier pris
oner*
Their release will he demanded
thru military channels without
waiting upon the tedious machin
ery of diplomacy.
