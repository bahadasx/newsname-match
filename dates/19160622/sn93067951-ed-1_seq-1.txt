Historic Sketches I
Of Chesterfield
\V. D. Craig
About the year 1755 John ?
Craig came to America from a
County Down, Ireland. Having v
been a close friend of Lord Ches- 1'
terfield while in theould country ^
the place where he settled about e
1758 was named for this courtly 1
gentleman. a
At this time all of 1-liia cor.t;?n !\
was wilderness and the route a
followed by the founder was
down what is now known as the t
old Tory Tail, which passes t
through the western section of u
Chesterfield county. Camp was '>
pitched by the party in what is 5
now known as toe King Sand
Kills near a bold spring near r
Rocky creek church. This trail h
was used by the Indians in going t'
from the low country to the a
mountains. Hearing from a t<
band of Indians of a large river ?'
to the East, John Craig left the
party with his family and made s
for what, is now Cheraw. When h
the present site of Ohesterliehl E
was reached he was so struck ri
with the beauty of this spot, t
and as it promised to he very b
healthy being between two bold ?
streams, the fiist settlement '
was made 011 the site of what is e
now the old Craig homestead. 11
The present house which was ^
I finished in 17US was b'-gun by h
j the founder of Chesterfield and f'
linrshed by his oldest son. . Just
l>efore the Revolutionary War a
dam was built of lofts across
what was then known as Green tl
Uiver (now Thompsons Creek) a; r'
exactly the spot where the great '
grand-son of John Craig has in hi
the past few years constructed a
modern cement dam and by the tl
means of the same generates
the power that furnishes our
good town lights. Vl
This plant is one of the best ''
in this section, and as an auxil- 111
lary plant is now being construe- vv
ed about two miles down stream u
by Mr. W. 1). Craig, who owns :'1
and operates the other plant,
this town will s ;on have power
to burr., as the -aying goes.
This article would not be com- 1
plete without a reference to W.
I). Craig, who is one of Chester- '
field's most progressive citizens
Not only in the matter of giving x'
our town light, but also as one 11
oi rue county's most progressive
farmers has Mr. Craig served '
t ,
this section. '
We do not wish to start any
controversy, hut we are reliably '
informed that Mr. Craig used ^
ensilage from a silo for fat(
1
tening cattle for the first, time
at least, in this county, and we
believe that he was the first in ai
the State. To Mr. Craig's pro- vl
gressive spirit this section has ^
long been indebted for the pure ^
hred milk cows, as he was the '/
first, to emphasize this side of ,n
the farm.
?- di
The heavy black clouds had ?
massed in tiie oast and west, A
the lightning was Hashing fierce- /'
ly between the heavy incessant
rolling of t he t blinder. (i,
Francis was terribly frightned, ,\
and his fond mother hud gathered
her young hopeful and tried
logically to calm his fears.
Don't be afraid darling.
There's nothing to fear. God
sends the thunderstorm to clear
the air, water the flowers, and
make it cooler for us* Now, w
don't wory, dear: it won't harm ,M
yon, and everything will be bet- ( '
ter when it's over.
The little fellow listened in
tently, ami as his mother finish ' '
ed he looked up at her gravely ' '
and said: "No, no, mother; yen
talk exacctly the way you did a'
last week when you took me to s<
the dentist to have the tooth "
pulled. *'

National Guardsmen
Galled to the Colors
Washington. ? Virtually the
ntire mobile strength of the
National Guard of all tne States
nd the District of Columbia
,as ordered mustered into the
federal service by President
Vilson. About 100,000 men are
xpected to respond to the eall.
'hey will be mobilized immeditely
for such service on the
lexico border as may later be
ssigned to them.
(leu. Funston, commanding
ho border forces, will designate
he time and place lor moveients
of guardsmen to the interational
line as the occasion
hall require.
In announcing the orders Secetar^v
Baker said the State
orces would be employed only
n guard the border and that no
dditional troop movements inu
Mexico were contemplated exept
in pursuit of raiders.
With the la.it. two weeks tonion
has been increasing steadier.
The crisis ptesented by Gen.
'arrunza's note demanding the
ecall of (ien Pershing's expediionary
force has been followed
y a virtual ultimatum served
n the American ollicer by Gen
revino. the Mf>vic*n ?yhv.o..u_
r in Chihuahua. To this was
tided the possibility that
.merman and Mexican troops
ad clashed across the bonier
oin San Benito, Texas.
This mobilization of the
ational Guardsmen to support
til Funston's line will pave
io way for releasing some 30,000
"gulars fur immediate service
i Mexico in the event of open
nstilities with the Carranza
overnaient. The Guardsmen
lemselves could not be used beoiul
