T told voii that I would write
you a few lines telling you how I
waa getting along. 1 am wen ana
enioyine myself as well as couia
be expected, ? The little town of
Sweet Springs has got to De quw
a burg to what it was ou yeara
ago. I made a flying trip to Se
dalia yesterday in a buzz wagon.
We went so fast 1 'eouidn 1 ,ieu
vary much about how the country
looks. The corn looked ratner
small for this time of year. It is
very wet m this part, we naa a
tmnA rain yesterday. ' Some are
not throucfh nlantine corn yet.
The oats crop is a uwie Deiwsr
" V-" I'ill t.
hiw than it ia out in Bates. . ine
wheat crop is tolerable fair. They
had very high waters here which
damaged the crops on the low iana
badly. The trains coumn t go
through when I got to Sweet
Springs. They had quite a uwie
wreck on the Lexington branch
yesterday, three coaches wer.e
ditched but no one was hurt.
Oh ves. I went to a bur Dutch
hinip one day last week and you
bet they had a joiiy gooa.nnus.n

Big Ordar for Ecsi J
W. Hj Charters, Jr., ia a busy
man these days. The orders f or '
his big boned rolannd Jhina nogs ;
are coming in so fast that he has '
to keep on the jump to keep up
with them. " Wednesday he re
AAived an order from Carl Ziegler,
of Elgin, Oklahoma, for twen-
five pigs, which is peruana ; tne
largest order for registered hogs
ever placed in with a Bates coun
ty breeder. The last of the week
he received an order for one ox.
his fine hogs to head a herd at
Maybank, Texas, also and order
for two from Star City, Arkansas;
and between times be found time
to sell two 'more to J. C. Hill, of
the Lakeside farm, southeast of
town. Three of these parties had
hornrht hoes of Mr. Charters be
fore and liked them so well that
they wanted more of the same.
He has established a reputation
for having srood hoes and for till
ing a mail order with as much care
as he would if the purchaser was
present in person.
