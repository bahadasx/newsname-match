FORMER BEMIDJI
BOY IS WOUNDED
IN EUROPEAN WAR
Word has been received by Mr. and
Mrs. Thomas Wilson of Nymore that
their son, Thomas, has been mortally
wounded in a battle in France. He
has been taken to a French hospital.
Thomas Wilson, Jr., went to Can
ada a year ago and joined the Cana
dian army. Soon after his enlist
ment the regiment to which he be
longed was transported to England
and from England later to the battle
fields of France.
Until the telegram from the Cana
dian authorities was received by Mr.
Wilson, no word as to where his son
was or with what company he had
been fighting with had reached his
parents.
The telegram did not contain any
details of the conflict or the place.
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson are waiting for
definite information regarding their
son
Thomas Wilson, Jr., was well
known in Bemidji, having made this
city his home for a number of years.
He was at one time employed as
waiter in the Symons Dairy Lunch
when the establishment was owned
by William Abel.
POSTERS CALLIN6 MEN
TO ENLIST IN CITIES
"Large posters calling upon the
young men of the state to enlist for
the expected war with Mexico have
been posted out of the Twin Cities as
far north as Wadena," said F. A.
Wilson, who with his wife arrived
in the city yesterday afternoon, earn
ing from Minneapolis by automobile.
"As we were leaving the city,"
said Mr. Wilson, "we saw the militia
boys boarding the street cars for St.
Paul where they marched in a great
military display to arouse interest in
enlistments. Although the present
call is for the infantry, the feeling
among the officers in St. Paul is that
the Bemidji naval militia will see ac
tive service in the near future as a
result of the present trouble with
Mexico."
Mr. Wilson says the state highway
between the cities and Bemidji to
be in first class condition.

Line at 4 A. M.
NoteThe following is the
third of a series of articles on the
food supply in Germany. The
United Press sent W. G. Shep
herd to Rotterdam to.learn at
first hand what experience Ger
many was having as a result of
the food stringency.Editor.
By William G. Shepherd.
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Rotterdam, May 27 (By mail)
Many families in Germany go meat
less for days and weeks at a time.
This I have learned from a neutral
business man of Dresden.
"It's as bad as housecleaning to
get meat. It upsets our whole house
hold economy as well as our finan
cial economy. It's a dreadful opera
tion and we don't go through it often
er than we have to. In the last six
teen days we have had meat twice.
Fish Main Food.
"Fish, new asparagus just in the
market, potatoes, spinach and dry,
crumbling war bread made largely of
potato flour, make up our list of edi
bles. We get so tired of it we hate
to go to the table. Sometimes we
even get so tired of it we decide we'll
have meat. Then there's trouble."
He was requested to go into the
details of a meat purchase in a Ger
man town.
"Well, it's like this," he said,
-lighting a good cigar (in some mys
terious way a huge shipment of Ha
vana cigars reached Berlin the other
day) "when we decide to have meat
my wife and I talk it over the night
before. If the next day is Tuesday
or Friday we can't buy anything but
fish, for those are meatless days.
"My wife calls our maid and says:
'Elizabeth, we want you to buy
a beefsteak for us tomorrow.' Eliza
beth frowns and goes out.
"This means that Elizabeth must
get up at four o'clock the next morn
ing and go to the nearest butcher
shop and stand in line until her turn
comes to buy meat or until the butch
er comes to the door and says to the
waiting line: 'I'm all sold out of
meat.'
"It is always a four or five-hour
job for her, unless she wants to get
into the quene at 1 o'clock, in the
morning, as some maids do.
"When my wife and I get up
Elizabeth is down at the butcher
shop and so I have to make the fires
while my wife gets breakfast. I go
off to the office and Elizabeth comes
home at 8 or 9 o'clock, sore on the
whole world.
"Sometimes she has been able to
get meat but more often than not she
comes back empty handed.
"Officially there are only two
meatless days a week but in reality
you find the butcher shops meatless
day after day.
Meat Makes Difference.
"I call up my wife sometime dur
ing the morning to find out whether
we are going to have meat for supper.
If she says we are, I'm happy all day.
You'd be surprised to know how much
difference a little meat makes."
"How much would Elizabeth pay
for a beefsteak
"Five marks and a half a pound.
"How we linger over supper when
we have meat! Elizabeth hasn't
done any work all day. She has
been upset by her morning experi
ence.
"You read of food riots in Berlin
That was only Elizabeth and her fel
low maid fighting to keep their places
in the line.
"But about supper time Elizabeth
wakes up, cooks the meat and brings
it in with smiles all over her face.
She knows she'll get here share. But
if we asked her to go out for meat
every meat day, she wouldn't stay
with us.
"That's where the rich folks come
in. They can hire maids who have
no other work to do but to go through
the meat raid daily.
"There are injustices galore about
the food distribution in Berlin. That
is why they have had food riots in
front of the Reichstag and in front
of butcher shops."
(The next article will tell of the
injustices in the distribution of food
fn Germany which give the rich man
the best of it.)

All Things Come To Him Who Wails
DOGTORSANDMAYOR
TO CENSOR MOVING
PICTURE AT GRAND
Special Exhibition to Be Run To
morrow Morning of "Damaged
Goods."
REMARKABLE PICTURE TO BE
SHOWN TOMORROW NIGHT
Officials to Be Given Chance to As
sure Themselves of Unusual
Qualities.
(By A. Wilson)
Mayor Vandersluis and the phys
icians of Bemidji will witness a pri
vate exhibition of the film, "Dam
aged Goods," at the Grand theater tor
morrow morning at 9:30.
This remarkable moving picture is
to be shown to the public, matinee
and evening, tomorrow and Satur
day
A Censor Board.
The purpose of giving the film a
preliminary showing is to permit the
mayor and members of the medical
profession to assure themselves, of the
unusual qualities of this peculiarly
powerful production
Bemidji is one of the first cities
outside of the Twin Cities and Duluth
to see this picture Other places yet
to see the film are such towns as
Crookston, Winona, Red Wing,
Northfield, Faribault, Albert Lea and
while Duluth saw "Damaged Goods"
for a week at the big Orpheum thea
ter, the crowds in that city could
not be taken care of during the one
week engagement, so the film is to be
taken back for another run
In New York city when the pic
ture was first introduced to the pub
lic, a special detail of police was
necessary to keep the streets cleared
of traffic because the jam of people
seeking admission, and the same in
tense interest has characterized the
presentation of "Damaged Goods"
wherever it has been shown.
Subject Delicate.
It is true that in some cities be
fore the film has an opportunity to
preach its never-to-be-forgotten ser
mon, well meaning, but misguided
persons have endeavored to prevent
the showing of the film, on what
grounds has never been clearly made
known
That the subject handled in this
film drama is a delicate one, nobody
will deny That this subject is
handled in such a way as not only
to conform with every rule of pro
priety but at the same time strike
him with sledge hammer force the
tragedy of a "wild oats" program for
any young man, will not be denied
by the hundreds of persons who are
going* to see this picture during its
short stay in Bemidji.
Support Film.
When "Damaged Goods" was first
shown in Minneapolis it was reviewed
by the municipal board of censors and
received unqualified endorsement. It
was shown in 11 days to 110,000 paid
admissions at the Strand theater on
Seventh street, across from the Or
pheum. In St. Paul, the ministers
were inclined to object to the film.
They were shown the film and some
of the men of the cloth who are
frankly opposed to moving pictures
as a general proposition, at once be
came strong supporters of this film
which teaches in an interesting and
thrilling way a tragic lesson and sol
emn warning against unclean moral
existence. In Milwaukee the commis
sioner of public health saw the film
and straightway gave his public en
dorsement and that endorsement is
being used by owners of the film for
advertising purposes throughout the
country, with the written permission
of the commissioner, who urges all
young persons and parents to see the
film.
Lesson Brought Home.
Incidentally, today the recruiting
N BATTLE WITH C^SMiST AS
offices in the cities are seeking men
to quiet the trouble with Mexico.
The officers in charge report many
young men who are willing to take
their place under the Stars and
Stripes, but who are physically un
fit to do so A large percentage of
these failures can be traced to the
things which "Damaged Goods"
teaches them to avoid. A lesson
brought home with graphic force.
Some are to blame themselves others
are the victims like unto the victim
shown in "Damaged Goods." The
blight of the plague lasts unto the
third and the fourth generation.

up to full strength preparatory
for a call to service. Late de

El Paso, June 22 A detachment
of American cavalry clashed with Car
ranza soldiers at Carrizeal, about 90
miles south of El Paso yesterday,
both sides suffering heavy casualties,
according to unofficial reports re
ceived by Mexican military authori
ties in Juarez.
The American command is said to
have been part of a scouting patrol
from Guzeman, returning to General
Pershing's line of communication.
Carrizeal, named as the place of the
encounter, is about nine miles south
west of Villa Thumada, the Mexican
field base in Northern Chihuahua.
All the prisoners admitted that the
blame should be put on the Amer
ican commander for having ordered
the attack. The prisoners were sent
to Chihuahua City, with the custom
ary protection. According to the re
port, which the Mexican authorities
are investigating, 40 Americans were
killed by machine gun fire in a sur
prise attack.
The Mexican casualties ~were said
to have not been heavy but General
Felix Gomez is named as being among
the Mexican dead.
Up to Funston.
General George Bell, Jr., who was
first informed of the fight by Mexi
can Consul Garcia, said that no mili
tary action would be taken in El Paso
while orders were awaiting from Gen
eral Funston. In the meantime, he
said his forces were ready for any
demonstration from the other side of
the Rio Grande.
General Bell said there was no
question but that a fight had taken
place, but was inclined to disbelieve
the report that any Americans had
been taken prisoners. The news was
spread throughout the Juarez, but
the Mexican city remained calm.
Take 17 Prisoners.
Later General Francisco Gonzales,
the Mexican commander at Juarez,
gave out a statement in which he an
nounced officially that the Mexiean
command had taken seventeen Amer
ican prisoners. He also said that
General Gomez's death had been con
firmed, but said he had no official
report as to the number of casualties

FAST MOTOR BOAT
TO BE PLACED ON
LAKE BEMIDJI SOON
A motor boat, capable of making a
speed of 22 miles an hour, will be
placed in operation on Lake Bemidji
for passenger and mail service in the
near future, according to R. E. Mil
ler. Mr. Miller will purchase the
boat if it is satisfactory.
Mr. Miller is endeavoring to get
the boat to Bemidji by July 4. The
boat is at present on White Bear
lake.
According to specifications received
by C. A. Bush, who is transacting the
deal, the boat is thirty-two feet long
with a six-foot beam. The boat has
a 40-horsepower hydroplane engine.
The interior of the craft is finished in
mahogany. Twenty people is the
capacity. J
Although it developes a speed of
twenty miles an hour, it only draws
eighteen inches of water. This is a
fine feature of the boat as it will be
possible to make excursion trips to
the Mississippi river dam.
Mr. Miller has arranged for an en
gineer and as soon after the boat's
arrival as is possible will arrange a
.definite schedule for passenger ser-
