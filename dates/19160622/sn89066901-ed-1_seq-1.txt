PROMINENT
BANKER
CONFESSES
Feels That His Friends
Should Know All :
In a recent letter to the Hays
Medicine Co., of Paducah, Ky.,
manufacturers of the. famous
new treatment for general disa
bility, "Hays' "Specific," Mrv S
B. Hushes.- one of , the most
prominent bankers in the State
of Kentucky, says:
For the benefit of any of my
friends and acquaintances who
may be afflicted with kidney or
liver trouble, I state that I have
found in Hays' Specific an effici
ent remedy and, I believe, a per
manent cure for myself. For
some time I was a sufferer from
a disorder of these organs and
finally resorted to Hays' Specific.
It is with no degree of pride that
I permit my name to be used to
promote the interest of the man
ufacture of this remedy, but that
it may be of some benefit to my
friends.
This great preparation is for
sale now to Mansfield by Fuson
