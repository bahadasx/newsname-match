LOOKOUT ON TOP OF
KIT. HUMPHREY PEAK
Tbe Forest Service has decided
to try-out a forestry service look
out on top of Mt. Humphrey Peak
and for that purpose Frank G.
Lewis who has been in charge of
the lookout on Elden Mountain for
three years has left for the top of
the Peak, tbe highest of the San
Franciscoa.
Lewis will camp right io the
saddle of ie peaks but will locate
his lookout on the highest part. A
packing outfit has been taken along
and he was accompanied to his
new hona by two other men to
help him get established.
" Many people have eaid that a
station an the top of the San Fran
ciscoa would not be a success. It
will be up to Frank G. Lewis to
settle this question. The estab
lishment of the new lookout is tor
that purpose. .
Humphrey Peak is 14,000 feet
high. Very few people are work
ing at a higher elevation. Humph
rty Peak is a little mope than 7,000
feet higher than Flagstaff.
From the? top of Humphrey
Peak, Lewis will have a magnifi
cent view of the suirounding
country. He will be able to see
the north part of tbe Grand Can
yon and innumerable mountain
peaks far and near in every direc
tion. - If the Humphrey Peak lookout
proves successful, the Forest Ser
vioe will improve the trail and
build .a cabin in the saddle for
the accommodation of the public
as well as the forest officers.

KNIGHTS WORSHIP AT '
GRAND CANTON SHRINE
Grand Canyon, June 18, Spe
cial trains of Knights Templar
have been arriving here for the
last 3 days. Car afur car sand
wiched in between puffing engines
that whe'eze and groan up the final
grade, has its quota of eager knights
and ladies. They are coming from
all over the United States on their
way to the Thirty-third triennial
convention to be held in : Los An
geles June 20th to 24th. '
Each special represents a sec
tion of the country. Today's
crowd is from the South. They
greet you with "Do you all live
here?" and after assuring you that
they love the Canyon, hasten to
tell of the splendid time they're
having. Last night's entertain
ment in the abservation car was an
Indian Concert, the chief actors
being blanket-wrapped knights
who howled and .danced in im
itation of the Navajos whom they
had ju.st seen at the reservation.
Yesterday's throng, after an order
ly march up the white road, held
a fencing contest, at the ball
grounds.
Knights and Ladies Bold don
the regulation denim riding suits,
Mexican hats, mount wide backed
mules and dare the twisting trail:
Knights and Ladies Timid take
the riin drive and enjoy the Can
yon's v changing moods in smug
complacency. Their pamphlets
proclaim that the tour is a pilgrim
age.. We had always thought of
pilgrims as a band with the light
of devotion in their eyes . but the
only light we have observed in the
eyes of these knights and their
ladies is the more modern one fun
and jollity.
