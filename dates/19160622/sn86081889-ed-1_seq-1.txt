Boy Badly Burned.
On June 19th, while S. E. Mc
Kee and his son Ralph were fill
ing a gasoline tank at their gar
ige and warehouse in Amaranth,
this county, using a bucket to
transfer the liquid from a barrel,
the gasoline in the bucket became
ignited and in a moment the
building was afire beyond con
trol. The garage and contents,
including several barrels of oil
and gasoline, were entirely con
sumed. The automobile was
saved. Had it not been for fa
vorable winds, the dwelling and
store would without doubt, have
been destroyed. Their son Mal
colm aged about 9 years, was in
the building at the time the gas
oline took fire, and the burning
fluid caught his clothes and burn
ed him so seriously that he is
now lying in a very critical con
dition. Doctors W. L. and J. M.
McKibbin were called and reliev
ed the boy's suffering as much
as they could. Harry Fisher who
Wa3 standing near the scene re
ceived some severe burns.
Had a Hood.
Edward Harr, of Riddlesburg,
sent us cash to push his subscrip
tion to '17, and added that they
had a flood on Tuesday of last
eek that washed away all the
railroad bridges in that vicinity,
stopping all trains for a week.

Some Spin.'
Saturday, June 17th, Mr. and
Mrs. Emory M. Booth, near War
fordsburg, and Mr. and Mrs.
Chester Plessinger, near Need
more, all in Mr. Booth's auto,
went to Hancock, picked up Em
ory's brother Erby, took dinner
in Cumberland, chatted with Em
ory's old chums at the Pure Oil
Station at Wellersburg, Md., and
passed through the Cumberland
Basin coal mining region to El
lersville and State Line where
they visited the Southern Oil
Pumping Station, they came back
through the "Narrows" for sight
seeing and on to Alleghen y Grove
greatly enjoying the beautiful
scenery. The party then went
back to Cumberland, did some
shopping and returned home af
ter having made a run of 126
miles without a mishap. They
found the roads in fine condition.
Fine.
The entertainment given by
the Mozart Orchestra and Con
cert Company of Johnstown last
Saturday night in the Auditor
ium was fine. The Company is
composed of ladies and gentle
men of refinement and they are
artists of high order and ability.
Not a murmur of disappoint
ment wa3 heard from the vast
audience that filled the room to
the walls. Each member per
formed his and her respective
part to the delight of the most
critical musical ear, and we as
sure them a hearty welcome,
should they stroll our way in the
future. The receipts-$92.50-indicate
that there were 370 paid
admissions. Half of receipts goes
to the C. L. S. C. to be used for
benefit of the public, perhaps in
the improvement of the Audi
torium stage, &c.
Wells to Rave Cherries.
Austin H. Stevens whose post
office address is Enid, called at
this office last Saturday and dis
cussed advantageous fruit grow
ing. Knowing that there is al
ways a demand for sour cherries
a variety that stands shipping
he planted 500 trees at the foot
of the sunny side of Rays Hill,
about one and a-half mile south
of New Grenada. The Broad
Top coal regions will, doubtless,
afford him a good market for the
products of that many trees. He
hopes to interest others so as to
make it worth while to combine
and reach out after more distant
markets.
No "Next" Here.
A barberless barber shop was
opened recently in Chicago. In
this new shaving parlor each pa
tron shaves himself. 'He is as
signed to a booth in which he
finds soap, razors, brushes, tow
els, powder, toilet lotions in
fact everything with which to
give himself a good shave.
There is little or no waiting in
this shop and no one is eligible
for tips. From the July Popular
Mechanics Magazine.
We Tamed It Down.
Last week we turned down an
advertisement that world have
netted us $100.00 to $200.00. The
advertisement was a tirade again
st Prohibition. The Brewers'
Association is offering all kinds
of money to newspapers to print
their stuff. We were as sure of
getting our price for the adver
tisement as we are sure of get
ting your dollar for your News,
but we turned . it down. We
want you to have a clean paper.
Stork News.
On Thursday of last week, a
little girl came to the home of
Mr. and Mrs. Hunter Fraker, at
Fort Littleton, one to Mr. and
Mrs. Harry Deshong, of Big Cove
Tannery, on Friday, and one to
Mr. and Mrs. Chester Decker,
near Saluvia, Saturday evening.
On Monday, a little boy arrived
in the home of Mr. and Mrs.
Bert Doyle, McConnellsburg.
' Information Wanted.
EditorNews: Havingbought
a tract of rough land in Fulton
county, I concluded to set fruit
trees thereon. After having
viewed the fruit problem from
all angles, including that of trans
portation, I decided in favor of
sour cherries, and in accordance
with that decision, I planted
more than 500 sour cherry trees.
Now, the thing I want to know
is this, namely, If you owned
such land as I have mentioned,
and your decision for best re
sults from that land fell in favor
of fruit, what kind and variety
of fruit would you plant?
Respectfully,
Austin H. Stevens,
Enid, Pa.
In as brief epace as possible,
our reply to Mr. Stevens is, that
we would firat determine the
adaptability of the location to
some particular kind of fruit,
soil and climate being the factors.
We would then satisfy ourselves
that we could send that fruit to
market in prime condition, de
pending, of course, on where we
found our market.
Mr. Stevens opens a wide field
for people of Fulton county to
think over. When the question
of quantity is a factor, there is,
it seems to us, but one answer.
If the grower's market is local,
he will lose money if he attempts
to grow more than , the market
will take. On the other hand, if
he wishes to become a shipper,
he must go into the business w ith
his neighbors on a 3cale sufficient
ly large to fully justify the em
ployment of salesmen on salary
to locate good markets each sea
son. There positively is no mid
dle ground on which . a perma
nent business may be built up.
Big orchards of any kind of fruit
are a snare and a delusion un
less they are sufficiently numer
ous to be handled in the manner
described, The grape growers
of New York state proved that,
at great loss to themselves, and
they continued to lose money un
til they grew enough grape
(thousands of tons) to employ
their own salesmen. But central
Fulton county's salvation depends
on prepared table products not
on the shipment of fresh fruits
of any kind.
Had Fine Meetings.
The annual Sunday School and
Christian Endeavor Convention
of the Ray's Hill and Southern
Pennsylvania Christian Confer
ence that convened with the Le
banon Christian Church closed
June 9th, 1916.
All of the sessions were well
attended and a great interest was
manifested in the Sunday School
and Christian Endeavor work.
20 schools reported with their
support and delegates. The ser
vices were spiritual throughout
and carried with them a deep
spiritual feeling. Many of the
visiting friends and delegates ex
pressed their appreciation of the
Convention and resolved to put
into practice the knowledge that
they had received.
The next Annual Convention
will convene with Jerusalem
Christian Church in Whips Cove.

OUR I'NEBUCATES GRADUATES.
Little Talks on Health and Djgiene fcj
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL D.,
Commissioner of Health.
A great essential has been neg'
lected in the education of the
tens of thousands of young men
and women who are graduating
from the high schools and col
leges of the country. They are
presumed to have been fitted to
meet the responsibilities and the
problems of life. In the majori
ty of instances they have had
mental but not physical educa
tion.
Some few have devoted them
selves to a greater or less degree
to competitive sports. Thisnum
ber is but a small fraction of
those who pass through our own
schools. Our curriculumsareof
ten so planned that they make
physical development difficult or
impossible. To lay the founda
tion of health there should be
proper physical training under
the supervision of specially train
ed medical men beginning in the
elementary school and going on
through the college course. A
few years of training in youth
and early manhood and woman
hood would serve to instill hab
its of personal hygiene which
would add inestimably to our fu
ture welfare, individually as a
Nation.
In every activity of life good
health is a primary essential.
No mental attainment can make
up for a puny, ill nourished, ill
developed body. Lack of well
developed physique almost invar
iably proves a handicap to achive-
ment. Our present system has
failed to bring about a balanced
education of mind and body. In
dividual efficiency and prepared
ness for the uncertainties of life
depend upon this.
To-day Sweden is leading the
world in systematic education
with a resulting high average of
citizens individually prepared to
take their part in the defense of
their homes. Three thousand
years ago the Greeks appreciated
and practiced in the education of
their youth this happy combina
tion. It was this training that
produced the scholars and heroes
whose names live in the world's
history.
Birthday Party.
While Stella Regi was in Mc
Connellsburg last Saturday, nine
ty of her friends met at her home
and when she returned and en
tered the house she was seized
and raised to the ceiling while
the guests cheered lustily. But
she didn't scare worth a cent and
was able to partake heartily of
the good supper that had been
prepared, and afterwards joined
the young people in their games
until a late hour. May each of
her succeeding birthdays be
brighter and happier.
Play Fair.
It seems that teamsters are not
the only ones who put rocks in
the middle of the roads on our
mountains and leave them there.
We have been told that autoist
do the same thing when they
stop for repairs, water, or to
gather flowers. Should one of
the latter run into one of the
rocks and wreck his machine,
what a howl there would be!
Glad to know the truth about the
matter. We want to play fair,
and we like to see others do the
same thing.
A Correction.
Last week, when we published
the obituary of Mrs. L. L. Cun
ningham, our copy of some names
given was not right A correct
ed list has since been furnished
as follows: "Where the name of
Mrs. McNeal appears, it should
read Mrs. Ellis W. Neal. Rev.
Duella should be Rev. L. N. D.
Wells. We stated that Mrs.'Cun
ningham assisted Mrs. McNeal
in millinery store, but it should
read L L. Cunningham assisted
Mr. Neal in millinery Btore.
Fargo, N. Dakota, Letter.
Elder H. Gallaher writes to
Pennsylvania friends to let them
know that he is still in the land
of the living. His letter follows.
I came to Fargo March 15,
1899. It was so cold I thought I
would freeze. Next day I went
to work, and remained here for
21 months. I then went back to
Burnt Cabins for a visit of three
months and returned to Fargo,
and it has not been my good for
tune to go back to Pennsylvania
since that time, much a3 I would
have liked to do so. During the
past ten years I have been mana
ger of Independent Ice Company.
I have gotten over my dislike to
the cold and mud, and think
there are more opportunities here
for a poor man to get into busi
ness for himself than back east,
and the climate is healthy.
We cut our ice 22 by 44 and
sometimes 36 inches in thickness.
We employ from 23 to 30 men in
ice harvest, and do a big business
in shipping in addition to filling
home trade orders. We use hay
instead of sawdust to preserve
the ice sawdust out here being
too expensive, and we can gener
ally use the hay two years.
I have been married twelve
years and have one girl and two
boys all going to school. We
have fine schools. We have lo
cated here the State Agricultural
College, Fargo College, a busi
ness college and a sisters' school.
There are good churches of sev
eral denominations. Island Park
covers many acres and the fish
ing and boating in Red River af
fords some of the amusements.
1 live close to the river and could
throw a stone across it into Min
nesota. Fargo ha3 a population of about
22,000. It has fine streets well
shaded with tree3, and is consid
ered one of the prettiest cities in
the West Out on the praries
are to be found the prarie chick
en, a bird resembling our Fulton
county pheasants. They and the
many ducks that stop here in the
fall afford 'fine sport for the
hunters. During winter months,
when snow is on the . ground,
our jack rabbits are white, but a3
spring approaches, they turn the
color of the fields. Gophers are
plenty and destroy much grain,
so that the govornment offers a
small bounty of a cent or two
each. Last fall I went to a place
65 miles south of here to hunt I
do not know if I should say any
thing about the ducks and geese,
for we did not get any, but the
country south of here certainly is
fine. Wish you would tell us
who we are to have for our next
president" Fargo seems very
well pleased with Wilson.
With best regards for all my
Pennsylvania friends, I am very
respectfully,
Elder H. Callaher, '

Purse for the Pastor.
Last Sunday afternoon, at the
close qf the Children's day exer
cises in the Big Cove Tannery
church, one of the members arose
and read the following: "In
loving recognition of the most ex
cellent service rendered our
church and Sunday school by our
pastor, Rev. Robt E. Peterman,
we hereby tender to him as a
token of our thankfulness this
purse of twenty-two dollars and
fifty cents as a free will offering,
and pray God's blessing to rest
upon him and his most excellent
wife and, also, upon his family
as a whole. Signed Members of
the Big Cove Tannery Lutheran
church."
Along with the purse came the
suggestion that the pastor and
family take a two weeks' rest
and use the contents of the purse
to help defray expenses. It is
needless to say that that accounts
for the happy smile on their pas
tor's face for when the heart is
happy the face will show it

Off to the War.
John C. Bishop, a native of
this county, employed at the
Cumberland Valley railroad sta
tion at Chambersburg, was in
McConnellsburg early this week
taking leave of friends before
joining his comrades who have
been called out by Uncle Sam to
defend our borders against raids
by Mexican bandits. John be
longs to Co. C. 8th Reg., Cham
bersburg. Total number to go
into camp from Chambersburg
will be about 100.
During tha past ten years or
longer, Mexico has been parcti
cally in a state of continuous'rev
olution. Ambitious leaders
spring up to wrest the reins of
government from each other. No
sooner does one set of politicians
get next to the government treas
ury than some other chap who
wants a shovelful of the gold
goes after it In this way they
have made poor old Mexico a me
nace and a nuisance to the Unit
ed States and to all the countries
south of us. All but about 15
per cent of the Mexicans are half
savage, ignorant breeds of mix
ed bloods, easily made to believe
whatever their chosen leaders Fee
proper to tell them. It is hard
for them to make even the scan
ty living to which they had been
accustomed for a century. The
offer of food and clothing in re
turn for their services in the
army looks like a princely sum to
them and they have been follow
ing the vicissitudes of war for a
living. The United States sent
troops into Mexico to punish the
raiders, and to try to capture
their chjef, a man named Villa
(pronounced Ve-ya). The proud
old Mexican, Carranza finding
that his "dignity" suffered there
by, has notified the United States
that he is ready to fight us at the
drop of the hat. Since there
now seems to be no other way to
get along with our neighbers on
the south, our army and navy
will be sent to that country to
take charge of affairs until such
time as the Mexicans can show
to the world that they are cap
able of self government
Cut His Lip.
Tuesday evening, some sum
mer Normal students had a foot
race near the eastern end of town
James Stahley, of Union town
ship, wa3 going down the pike at
a clip that would have made old
Dan Patch look like thirty cents.
Suddenly, his toe tipped a stone
and Stahley fell against a wheel
of a wagon that was standing
along the road, with the result
that he received a cut an inch in
length across his upper lip. The
steel tire against which he fell
cut through the lip, and Dr. Mos
ser had to put in two stitches to
close the wound.
