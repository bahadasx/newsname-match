Redpath Chautauqua.
Do you know that the biggest
and best Redpath Chautauqua
ever held in the town of Marino
opens tomorrow afternoon at 3
o'clock and continuing through,
the week in the morning, after
noon and evening? Do yea
realize Hi at the entertainment
that you get here is the best
that can be found in the United
States and you get here is
the best that 'can be found in
the United States and that you
are getting for the whole week
what the city of Chicago and
other large cities pay for sirgle
numbers? The great secret of
this is not that the numbers con
be put on cheaper here than in
Chicago but that by the cooper
ation of the whole town in pur
chasing 700 season tickets the
Redpath people are able to get
talent which in no other way
could be brought to a town
of this size.
Do you realize that you- are-
getting a season ticket for the
sum of two fifty which averages,
a little more than twelve cents
a number for the entire week
which makes your splendid en
tertainment no more expensive
than moving pictures and so
ridiculously cheap that it seems
impossible that anybody can af
ford io be without one?
Do you know that 89 citizen
of Marion have guaranteed the
chautauqua this year and that if
you wish the Chputnuqua to
come here year after year it ir
your boumlen duty to help these
citizens ma ice good their guaran
tee and help to get the Chautau
qua back for the ccming year?'
Let us all work together to make
Marion, the smallest town on the
Redpath circuit still the best.
