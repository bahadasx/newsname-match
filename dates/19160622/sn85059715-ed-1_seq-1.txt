B ernors seeking reports of the number
of national guurd regiments mobilized.
B Othcials said President Wilson,
would await a definite report of what,
has happened front General Pershing.
It wr.s not expected until late today
as the town of Carrizal, where the
B fighting was said to have occurred, is
sixty miles or more front General
Pershing's advance base at Natni
quipa.
At the White House it was said tho^
president's policy was unchanged for'
