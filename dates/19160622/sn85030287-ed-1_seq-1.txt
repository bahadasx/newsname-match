A New City Tank
Work on a new city water
tank was commenced Monday.
It will be atj the same old loca
tion, south of the. fire depart
ment house, and will be of re-in-forced
concrete. . We are glad
to note this improvement, as the
old one truly was an "eye sore."
Considerable complaint has
been made recently regarding
automobiles running without
lights, and exceeding the speed
limit. There is a state law cov
ering both offenses and if an ex
ample were made of one or two
violaters, the others would no
doubt profit thereby.

surrounding points of interest.
Witn her. "Boot Hill" where
were buried the dead cow boys
who got "sassy" with the town
marshal; with her "Horse Thief
Canyon," where in early days
the outlaws and bandits took ref
ugefrom the arm of the law;
with, her "Fort Dodge" where
were stationed the regulars who
helped civilization to gain a foot
hold in those troublesome times,
and where now is located one of
the finest state soldiers' homes
in the country, and with the
many other points of interest
made historic by the scenes en
acted in the former cow boy cap
ital, the films taken on July 4th
will undeniably prove a popular
hit with the moie fans all over
the country.
The wheat will .be ready to
harvest in a short time.
