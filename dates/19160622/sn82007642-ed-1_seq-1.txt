HUGHES AND FAIRBANKS.
(From The Nw lork Tioiei )
The nomination of Theodore
Roosevelt by the Republicans
would have had a meaning clear
to every American mind. That
candidacy would have raised
high and made visible the issue
of opposition to Woodrow Wil
son on the only grounds that
make it capable of statement. It
would have meant that in the
judgment of the Republican par
ty the Unitted States ought now
to be engaged in the European
war, that it ought to be at war
with Mexico, or as a conqueror
aetually in possession of
that country. The nomination of
Mr. Hughes must bear to for
eign observers a bewildering like
ness to an express indorsement
of the administration of Wood
row Wilson. He is a man of the
same type, conservative, deliber
erate,' accustomed to consider
carefully the consequences of his
acts, never rash, never yielding
to hasty impulses or Bwayed by
the heat of passion, yet withal in.
ferior in capacity and experience.
It is impossible to imagine Mr.
( Hughes as resident writing a
h message to Congress demanding
f a great war credit and instant
naval and military preparation
i 4 for a war with Germany because
of the invasion of Belgium or the
'.-'destruction of the Lusitania.
3 The utmost stretch of fancy does
1i not enable us to see him asking
Congress on Mexico. The picture
would be wholly imaginary, false
to the man and the occasion.
Yet the Republicans have ab
solutely no other issue upon
which with any degree of force
and consistency they can demand
of the people a withrawal of their
confidence in President Wilson.
That issue they dare not raise
They condemn, they denounce,
they use freely the adjectives of
the language, but', their nouns
and verbs have no specific mean
ing. If Mr. Roosevelt's denuncia-
tions of the administration mean
' any thing at all, they mean that
X he would have gone to war with
j Germany, that he would have
'$ gone to war with Mexico. That
is the popular understanding of
what he is driving at He was the
$ indicated and logical candidate,
. v the only candidate by whose nora
, ination the Republicans would
' have clearly manifested their a-
? version to Mr. Wilson's policy of
peace, their preference for a poli
cy of war. Even Mr. Roosevelt s

X the din of many explosions, leave
- no distinct impress on the mind.
President Wilson, he says, "has
rendered to his people the most
evil service that can be rendered
to a great democracy by a cho
sen leader." By not going to war
with four -monarchies and one re
public? His words raise no other
issue' against Mr. Wilson that the
mind of the people could grasp,
To have put him before them as
a candidate, with loud outcries
for war upon his lips and a plat
form denouncing the administra
tion for not plunging the country
into war would have put the Re
publicans into the campaign with
a definable issue.
The candidate they have cho
sen has of necessity been speech
less. He uow says: "I stand for
the firm and unflinching main
tenance of all the rights of Amer
kan citizens on land and on sea.'
Would Mr. Hughes have gone to
war about the Lusitania, or
would he have maintained un
flinchingly the rights of Ameri
can citizens on land and sea, as
Mr. Wilson has maintained them
by the peaceful methods of diplo
macy? The PresidenFhas faf ced

A little Mexican History.
Taylor, with 5,000 Americans
defeated Santa Anna, with 20,
000 Mexicans at the battle of
Buena Vista
Scott captured the City of Mex-
ico with 6,000 men.
Doniphan, with less than a
thousand men, defeated 1,200
Mexicans at Bracito river and
later, with a force reduced to
924 men, routed 4,000 Mexican
soldiers strongly entrenched and
provided with great stores of
ammunition and arras.
Against the 12,000 American
soldiers in Mexico are 30,000 to
35,000 Carranzista troops. The
disadvantage justifies some un
easiness. But in the iiirht of his
tory, we need entertain no trou
bling as to the outcome. There
is no reason to believe that the
Mexican under Obregon is more
of a soldier than he who served
with Santa Anna.

what more could Mr. Hughes
have done? nad we gone to war,
Geamany would now be destroy
ing every enemy passenger ship

marines could hold their way.
and we could ask no redress. "In
our foreign relations," he says,
we have suffered incalculably
from the weak and vacillating
course which has been taken with
regard to Mexico." Weakness
and vacillation would never have
wrung from Germany her con
sent to abandon methods of war
fare which her government and a !
great part of her people believe
to be well justified and essential
to the success of her arms. Mr.
Hughe's statement is preposter
ous, bis criticism flat Mid feeble.
As his part in an agreement, with
Oyster Bay it can be understood,
but inevitably he lays himself o
pen to the inevitable question:
"Pray, what would you have
done?" and that question he will
never answer. .
Not less pointless are the can
didate's observations on Mr.
Wilson's course with Mexico. It
was "lamentably wrong," says
Mr. Hughes. He must tell the
country what course would have
been right, and then prove that
it would have been more success
ful than Mr. Wilson's course. Ap
parently, he would have recogni
zed Huerta. We sought, to dic
tate, he says when we were not
concerned. How would it have
helped matters to set up the pre
tense of friendly relations with
thot old devotee to brandy and
usurpation? Responsibility for
our relations with Mexico would
have made Mr. Hughes more cau
tious about his language. Minor
troubles there were inevitable,
The major trouble of war with
Mexico was the only sure way to
end them Mr. Wilson has avoi
ded war. Mr. Hughes also would
have avoided it.
The Republicans want to get
the Democrats out in order that
they may get in that is the only
issue upon which tbey can speak
boldly. They have no other.
They select theircandidatesfrom
a historical period long past. Mr.
Huches means nothing to the
country save what would have
been meant by any other chosen
among forty silent men. The
candidacv of Mr. Fairbanks
means nothing more than the
hope of winning the electoral
voles of Indiana and a few other
states where ho is held in esteem
by men who are unawares that
anything has happened since
1900. Platform and candidates
are a confession that the Repub

an Americanism that knows no

creed, we have but one country,
and we do not for an instant tol

A Nation's Sorrow.
One great man to a nation-

chances at the tragic moment to
be the vitally important profes
sionthere is a pathos in his
ery solitude of grandeur, sug
gested in the lines of the Associa
ted Press chronicler: Kitchener
as the one outstanding person
ality whom the people believed
in as a great man. This man cut
off suddenly, dramatically, with
out warning: we have a picture of
nation in sorrow, a nation in
grief.
If it be true thatgreat men are
measured by their detractors as
towers by their shadows, by this
rule, also we must accord a high
grandeur to the character of
Britain's taciturn warrior, and
by it are the people justified in
the surrender of their imagina
tion to thisimposingflgure which
they have surrounded with all
the glamor of military romance.

knight, the Boldier of spotless
soul, profound wisdom and in
vincible will. And the world has
held this high ippraisal of his
people fully won.
The outside world has, howev

and more critical of the great
war, holding that the tasks com
mitted to his bands were too
great for it, too great, perhaps,
or any man, has perceived a
ong succession of fatal blunders.
Yet perhaps the judgement of
posterity will be more kindly. If
it required the most terrible les

ammunition needed, if munitions
were slow of production and if
thousands of England's best yiel

tardiness, yet a vast army has
been created and organized, for
