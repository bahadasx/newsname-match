In Honor oC Mrs. Cox
The members of Class No. 10 of
the Methodist Sunday School gave
a picnic Monday evening at the
home of Miss Stella Lawson in honor
of Mrs. J. W. Cox who has taught
this class the last 15 years. About
thirty were present, there being
three out of town guests. The occa
sion was a ver' pleasant one, tlio
all were sad at the thought of
parting as Mrs. Cox leaves Wednes
day for her home in Shclbina. Mrs.
Cox hud the first organized class in
the Methodist Sunday School and
this same class has accomplished
more in the past IS years than any
other class in that school. Four of
the charter members were present.
While there has been many changes
in 15 years, the class has has ever
been harmonious and by their unit
ed efforts have accomplished much
They have always been devoted to
teacher who has at all times given
largely of her love and time. Just
before supper was served, Mrs Estes
Johnson, in behalf of the class, pre
sented Mrs. Cox with a set of collar
pins as a parting token of their af
fection. Before they parted for
their homes Mrs. Cox had a parting
speech. It was in rhyme and was
original. It touched .the heart of
every one present As Shelbina
is not far away they hope she may
often be with them and always feel
that she is one of them.
