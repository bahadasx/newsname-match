U. . ON VERGE OF
WAR WITH MEXICO
Entire National Guard and Militia Called Out B3
President's Order.-Men From Each State to Bt
Mobilized at Own Camps and Prepared Foi
Seryice Along Border.
Washington, June 18.-P-res. ll
TVikon has called out the militia a
of every state for service on the
Mexican border. If
Brig. Gen, Alfred Mills esti- L
mated the minimum militia force t
to be called out to be 143,000
men. I
General Funston, commanding t
the border forces, will designate II
the time and place for move
ments of guardsmen to the inter- a
national line as the occasion shall r
require. h
In announcing the orders Sec. a
Baker said the state forces would t
be employed only to guard the
border and that no additional I
troop movements into Mexico
were contemplated except in
pursuit of raiders.
Simultaneously with the Na- e
tional Guard call, Secretary Dan- a
iels of the Navy department, or- hl
dered additional war vessels to a
Mexican waters on both coasts ,
to safeguard American lives. 4
At the War, Navy ,and State
departments it was stated that I
no new advices, as to the situa- F
tion in Mexico liad come to pre- ,
cipitate the new orders. e:
Within the las two weeks, sI
- i iivever, tension rhas been in
creasing steadily. Tlhet crisis al
presented by General Carranza's a
note demanding the recall of g
Gen. Pershing's expeditionary
force has been followed by a ih
virtual ultimatum served on the 10
American officer by Gen. Tre
vina, the Mexican commander in
Chinuahiua. To this was added
yesterday the possibility that
American and Mexican troops a
had clashed across the border s
from San Benito, Texas. s
El Paso, Tex., June 18.-The u
calling out of the National Guard e
by President Wilson today is be- v
lieved by local army officers to t
be the answer of the President t
to the recent note of Gen. Car
ranza. That the two nations will
be involved in war during the f
present week is the belief ex- 1
pressed by both State depart
ment agents and army officers
heroe wioi have followed the situ
ation closely.
The hostile attitude of the de
I facto governmient is today made
more serious by the gradual
tightening of the circle of '5,000
Mexican troops around General
Pershing and his force of 11,000
troops. General Trevino, coin
wandler of the division of the
North, has ordered [is lieuten
ants coinmmanding the forces sur
rounding General Per-;hing to
hem in the punative expedition
and prevent any attempt made
to escape to the border.
Frankliintoiin Water Sitpply
Standls Prescribed Test.
State Labratory Car No. 4
early in June collezted a speci
men of water from the court
house well for chemical analysis
and Mayor Sheridan received a
gratifying report from the test
Monday.
In a letter from the Mayor
Dr. Dowling stated that the
Franklinton water supply was
safe for potable purposes and
enclosed a certificate from the
state chemist to that effect.
The people of Franklinton and
also Bogalusa, where the deep
wells stood the test, should con
gratulate themselves upon a pure
water supply, as some deep wells
in the state were condemed and
ordered closed.
