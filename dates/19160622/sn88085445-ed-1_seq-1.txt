NEW YORK CITY MARINE BAND CHAUTAUQUA FEATURE
THEKE are over 250 bands in New Yors city playing In concert. Some are good bands and some are better, and al>out twenty of them have become famous throughout America. H
can readily lie seen that New York Is somewhat of a "band city." But there is one band in New York that every one from tbe uewsboy to the stockbroker on Wall street is proud
to call New York's "best" band.
That band Is the New York City Marine Band. It has played to music lovers for more than three generations Hnd has remained through these long years the leading military hand
of New York city and the United States. At Newport, R. 1., last summer over 10,000 people appeared on tbe beacbes to hear the tlual coucert of this great organization. It was a great
day. The leader acceded to the demands of the people and played literally hundreds of selections for tbe music mad audience.
There have been good bands at Chautauquu before. But there has never been a band at any Chautauqua that will "put over" such music as the New York City Marine Band when It
appears fur two big concerts on "Band Day."
