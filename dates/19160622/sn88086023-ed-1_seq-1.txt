EAST OREGONIAN, PENDLETON, OREGON, THURSDAY,
Men Here Hasten
to Enlist Should
Troops be Needed
The war spirit of the nation, result
ing In buBtllng preparations for pros
pective hostilities in Mexico, was
brought home to Pendleton last even
ing when a special tram, bearing four
companies of Idaho militia, stopped in
the city for an hour en route to Boise
where the Idaho national guard Is
being mobilized.
The spirit was contagious and was
communicated to many men of Pen
dleton by the sight or the khaki-clad
militiamen marching about the city.
So keen were many for a chance of
possible action that one of the com
panies left a sergeant behind to se
cure some recruits, inasmuch as all
of the four companies were short of

by Captains Allen. Mattlson, Jones and

gan and Oliver Rhtnehart. Sergeant
Jacobson declared he had a good
many other prospects and would re
main until further orders.
Many Pendleton men are eaker to
get into action but most prefer to wait
until they learn whether there is any
prospect of a company being organiz
ed In Pendleton. Last evening soon
after Sergeant Jacobson had started
his recruiting work in the city hall,
Herbert McGinn, former corporal In
Co. I, . set up a counter movement by
announcing that he was securing the
names of men who would Join a local
company. He secured more than 20.

in this county. He is a son of the
late Andrew Jacobson. known some
times as Andrew Rauhala, who died

AMERICAN NOTE
IS RESENTED BY
DE FACTO HEADS
Officials in Mexico City Point Out
Alleged Fallacies in Argument of
President Wilson.
MEXICO CITY. June 22 Mexican
officials today generally resented the
tone of the American note and point-,
ed to the alleged fallacies in Wilson's
argument. They contend that the
presence of American troops in Mex
ico no longer is justified. It is gener
ally believed that Villa is dead, since
three months have elapsed since any
one has seen him. His small force has
been dispersed.
one official said: "We warmly
challenge the statement that the con
stitutionalists have not cooperated
w ith the Americans to prevent border
raids. At the beginning of the trou
ble Obregon asked for the plans ot
the American expedition so that he
could cooperate. The information was
refused, leaving him at a great disad
vantage. "The fact that one raider was found
with an old constitutionalist commis
sion in his pocket is not proof of the
Wilson contention that Carranzistas
participated in the raids It is un
just to blame the Mexican authorities
lor such sporadic acts "
Weed-Cutting and
Dog-License Laws
Will be Enforced
Strict enforcement of the weed-cutting
and dog-license ordinances was
ordered last night by the city coun
Oil The police were given instructions
to see that the provisions of the ordi
nances are carried out under penalty
of arrest.
Councilman Phelps brought the,
matter to the attention of the council, i
He pointed, out that published notice i
had been given that weeds must be
cut but that there had been little com
pliance and no attempt to force it. The
ordinance requires all residents toi
keep their premises and adjoining!
streets free of noxious weeds and alii
owners of vacant lots to do the same. I
A motion was made and carried that
the recorder give published notice:
again and that a time limit for com
pliance be specified after which the)
police were to arrest all who have not
obeyed
Councilman Phelps also called at-:
tention to the fact that about half the,
dog owners in the city have paid 11-;
cense fees and that the other haif
have not and enjoy the same priv
ileges as those who have. He made
the motion, which was carried, that
this ordinance be strictly enforced al
so. ICAN T
REPORTED TAKEN
WASHINGTON, June 22. Arredon
10 has asked that Pershing explain
the presence of his soldiers far from
headquarters, also about the battle!
at Carrizal and the reported seizure
of two Mexican towns by Pershing.
Lansing replied that he was without
Information, but would Inquire.
Arredondo'a information about the
Carrizal fighting tallied with newspa
per accounts springing from Mexican;
sources. He declared that the Am
I erlcan commander showed lack of
prudence In going so far from head
quarters. He said that several had been killed
on both sides and 17 Americans cap
tured. Arredondo's conference lasted a
' short time.

WASHINGTON, June 22. A gen
eral invasion of Mex;co appeared im
minent today. There appeared little
doubt but that Pershing's report ot
the Carrizal battle will aggravate
rather than relieve the situation
The president will not go before
congress until Pershing's detailed re
port has been made The Mexican
situation came before congreas thia
morning when Senator Works called
up a resolution which was introduced
five months ago demanding interven
tion. He wanted to know why the
loreign relations committee had not
acted. Works did nut force a debate
and the matter was dropped.
Although the Mexicans claim that
the Americans were (he aggressors by
attempting to capture the Carrizal
station, bolder reports were that the
Americans were merely reconnolter
ing and were led into ambush.
Nobody seriously professed the be
lief that trouble can be avoided now.
The immediate dispatch of the Cali
fornia. Missouri and Kansas militia to
the border has been directed. None
of these has completely mobilized.
Other state's troops will be moved
when properly equipped.
The fact that Americans are held
prisoners makes the matter serious.
Pershing undoubtedly will demand
their immediate release without wait
ing on the tedious machinery of di
plomacy. SAN ANTONIO. June 22 Funston
received a message this afternoon
from Pershing declaring that he bad
received no report from the American
troops engaged In the Carrizal battle.
