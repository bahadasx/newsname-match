FIRST STEPS ANNOUNCED TO GET
MOERN TELEPHONESYSTEM HERE
Rates Which Would Possibly (Go Into Effect If Central
Energy System Is Built Given Out in A
Letter From Cumberland Telephone Co., To
Mayor Sullivan
In a letter to Mayor Sullivan the
Cumberland Telephone Co. gives
some details to the building of a
modern telephone system in Boga
lusa. For months it has been
known that the Dresent system
would not be able to handle the (i
increased business, and the fact
that Bogalusa has, without the
shadow of a doubt, become a pet
manent and onie of the leading
cities of the state, the Cumberland
Telephone Co. realizes that it will ut(
be only a question of a shbrt time Wi
when they would be compelled to de;
put in a Central Energy system to Th
handle the business in a satisfacto- clE
ry manner. Following is a copy of
the letter received by Mayor Sul- M,
livan. sa
New Orleans, La., 6-6-16
Mr. W. H. Sullivan, Mayor,
Bogalusa, La. Bt
Dear Mr. Sullival: at
This is to acknowledge Je
receipt of your esteemed favor of Pi
May 25th, relative to the inistalla
tion of a common battery system
in Bogalusa, La.
For your information, would say hi
that your request has been forward- ec
ed to the General Manager and will
be given every possible considera- th
tion.. a
In connection with the cost to
this colmpany. I regret that we can
not furnish you with the figures at j
this time, for the reason that the
Engineering Department is now on
the work and it will be some little
time before they are p)repared to n
make a report.
Relative to the rates, I would say p
that in exchanges where we have
converted the system fro . the d
Magneto type, such as is now in
Bogalusa, to common battery the B
5 following rates have applied, and it s'
is my belief that they would apply f
ain Bogalusa. A
When the system at Alexandria d
was converted into common battery
the following rates applied: c
Within the exchange or corporate
limits when such limits exceed the u
exchange radius, the rate for resi- n
- dence telephones to be $2 per month
each, and for business direct line
$3.50 per month each until there
are 1000 telephones connected to
and receiving service from the Al
exandria exchange.
From and after the time there are
1e 1000 telephones in service the di
r rect line residence rate to be $2 per
d month each, and for business di
t- rect line $4 per month eacfi, until
tv there are 1,500 telephones connect
5 ed to and receiving service from
0 the exchange.
he From and after the time there I
sare 1,500 telephones in service
Ct direct residence to be $2 per month I
s. each and for business direct 'line
of 4.50 per month.
re From and after the time there
eil are 2000 telephones in service, di
he rect residence rate to be 2.00 per
m month each, and for business direct
line telephones 5.00 per month each.
The above being the rates and
conditions heretofore approved by
the Railroad Commission of Louisi
or- aina under similar circumstances at
of other points desiring this change of
eir service in the state.

WILSON AND MARSHALL
AGAIN LEAD'DEMOCRACY
Only One Vote Cast
Against President At
Convention
St. Louis, June 15-At six min
utes before midnight Woodrow
Wilson was renominated for Presi
dent by the Democratic convention.
The nomination was made by ac
clamation.
Two minutes later Thomas Riley
Marshall was renominated in the
same manner for Vice-President.
The nomination of Wilson was
not unanimous-quite. Robert E.
Burke. of Illinois, voted "no," when
at 11:64 Senator Hughes, of New
Jersey, moved to nominate the
President by acclamation.
When Burke, who came to St.
Louis for the express purpose of
voting against Wilson, had shouted
his "no," Chairman James thunder
ed:
"I declare Woodrow Wilson to be
the nominee of this convention by
a vote of 1,092 to one."
Wilson and Marshall will be sent
into the campaign on a platform
which declares:
For Americanism and against " '
hyphenated Americansism.
For the enfranchisement of wo
men....bv the States.
For ,continuance of 'the present
policy in .Mexico.
For a continuance of the Presi
dent's; foreign oolicy.
For all the declarations of the
e Baltimore platform, save the anti
t second term plank, and the plank
favoring the exemption of tolls for
American ships passing through the
a Panama canal. They are deftly
dodged in the preamble cf the de
d claration.
A demonstration lasting 45 min
e utes followed the placing of Wilson's'A
name before the convention by
h Judge Westcott, of New -Jersey.
The same jurist made tle nominat
e ing speech at Baltimore.
O
I- Lost-But Happy
e Dr. Rose, professor of Chemistry
- of the Texas University while motor
ing with other parties to North
- Carolina got lost from the other cars
il and landed in BoQalusa Saturday
t night. When he arrived at the Pine
STree Inn he decided it was such a
revelation that he would remain
re here for several days. "To find sudh
ea hotel in a city the size of Boga
thlusa is very unusual" the doctor
e said, "and the meals and service are
such that I am sory that I did not
re make my plans t6o stay here instead
li- of going to North Carolina. How
er ever I am going to remain here
Ct until Monday and see 'The City
h. Unusual."
s Cutting Down Hills
of Two of the big hills betCeen
North Bogalusa and Columbia street
have been cut down, which has
caused much favorable comment
by the tax pavers of the city.
Work on graveling the streets is
Sprogressing nicely, and before long,
on the gravel roads will circuit the
ng. most of the city.
