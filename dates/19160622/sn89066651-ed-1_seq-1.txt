Tlm, the above order to our
militia boys made things take
on a different as pect. It made
our people begin to think of the
horrors of the European war.
Capt. Kccves immediately got
busy and assembled the mem
bers of his company together,
many of whom lived out of Ca
ruthersville. Several were in
this city, many on the farms,
and others at work on the drain
age ditches. Many of the mem

act which pledges members of
tho staff guard for federal ser
vice. Company "B1 entrained for
Nevada Wednesday at 11:00a. in.,
and a good company was on
hand. They will go in encamp
ment at that place and await or
ders for a move to the border,
which is likely to come in a few
weeks, as it seems tho situation
continues to grow more intense
daily.
The autivo service will be a
good thing for our boys, and
they are not the only ones who
are glad to go. Should there be
a necessity, many American
boya will Hock to tho Mag.
The scone at the armory was
one of sympathetic thought, ono
in their lives, not since the call to
arms in 1808, when President
McKinloy heralded the message
to the American people for volun
teer troops to free the Cubans
from tho terrible tread of the
Spanish monarchy.

the armory. Their arrival was 7JJ good, able bodied men for
greeted by members of tho service on (he Mexican bor-

The band did themselves
honor, and after selection after
selection was given another call
for the music was made. The
hand responded with Dixie,
which was met with a general
applause. The members oi the
band thank the owners of the
cars who furnished conveyance
to that city.
At about 10:30 the militiamen
began to file out of the armory
building and were arranged in a
full two line across Ward avenue,
every one of the members in full
inarching order. A way was
cleared for the photographer to
take the last look with the camera
before the boys left lor the front.

will not see the service for which
they were mobilized.
Newt Maxwell.
Newt Maxwell was in this city
Thursday of l.it week telling his
usual h-,h story, and in tho con
versation as Iced us to tell the
(Voters in the columns of the
I Herald that he is a candidate for
I the office of Sheriff of Pemiscot
county on the Democratic ticket.
To tell the truth, we are not
able to introduce Mr. Maxwell,
and feel that he is better ac
quainted with the people of this
! county than the Herald editor.
However, he insists that we say
a few little things.
Newt was a candidate for the

who were also in uniform, and
all the while playing the national
airs. This was well worth see
ing. It tilled an American citi
zen with pride and love for
native land.
After several selections,
militia went aboard the
.special cars that had been placed
for them, and was joined to the
noon train for St. Louis.
