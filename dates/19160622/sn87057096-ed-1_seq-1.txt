WILSON AMP MARSHALL
Renominated at the Democratic Na
tional Convention Held at St.
Louis Last Week.
President Woodrow Wilson and
Vice President Thomas R. Marshall
•were renominated last Thursday at
the democratic national convention
held at St. Louis last week, the busi
ness of the convention going through
with a rush and without a single
hitch in the program, President Wil
son being nominated on Thursday ev
ening, the delegates being anxious
to finish the business and return to
their homes. The convention was
marked with great enthusiasm and
the platform adopted which is pub
lished in full on page four of this is
sue is the one on which the demo
cratic party can go before the people
with a clear conscience, firm in the
belief that they will be again trium
phant at the election in November.
A feature of the convention was the
ovation given to Wnr. J. Bryan, who
has announced that he will take the
stump for President Wilson and the
democratic party, thus setting at rest
the republican report that Bryan
would fight Wilson. Mr. Bryan
lauded President Wilson and urged
his hearers to support him and his
policies.
Xew Produce Firm.
M. S. Jones and- Harry Statzell
have purchased the old established
poultry and produce business of Jap

twenty-five years, and they will con
tinue the business at the present lo
cation in the Hamilton building on
west Commercial street. Mr. Jones
has been in the poultry and produce
business for many years, and Harry
Statzell has been associated with his
father in the business for a number
of years. They will make a strong
firm, and have an established repu
tation of giving the farmers the best
of the market at all times. They will
endeavor to enlarge the business and
their customers will always receive
the very top market prices for their
poultry and produce. Mr. Jap Stat
zell after his many long years of at
tending to business six days a week
will take a well earned rest. We
commend the new firm to the people
of Decatur county.

home. Near the farm of Kim Hick
man, five miles southeast of Leon,
there had been a shower and the
road was quite slippery and in going
down a small hill the car skidded
and turned turtle. Fortunately they
had the top up, and this protected
the occupants so that they were not
injured aside from slight bruises and
a general shaking up. The wind
shield of the car was demolished and
some other minor breaks, and the
car was brought back to Leon for re
pairs.

A
MIKIHMUOI) IN NEW MEXICO.
Vincent J. Strickland, of Lamoni,
Murdered 'at East Vanglm,
New Mexico.
Vincent J. Strickland, a young man
about 18 years of age, whose home
was at Lamoni, was mujdered at
East Vaughn, New Mexico, on Mon
day, June 12th, his body being
brought to Lamoni for burial last
Friday.
Young Strickland left Lamoni
about a week previous to visit his
sister, Mrs. C. A. Rutiedge, at Clay
ton, New Mexico, and intended to
go to Arizona for his health, leaving
the home of his sister a few d.'ys
previous. Particulars of his death are
meagre, and his relatives were at a
loss to understand why he stopped at
East Vaughn, but it seems he arrived
there at midnight and remained in
the depot the balance of the night
waiting for a train south. He was
standing on the depot platform with
three Americans and two Spanish
Americans when the Santa Fe night
watchman walked up to him and plac
ed his revolver against his right side
and fired, the bullet going through
his body and killing him instantly.
After his death it was discovered
that he had been robbed of his watch,
railroad ticket and about $25 in
money.
A Slight Advance in Advertising
Kates.
Owing to the enormous increase in
the cost of everytning connected with
the printing business, print paper
having advanced more than 100 per
cent in the last few months, newspa
pers all over the country are com
pelled to increase their subscription
and advertising rates. The Reporter
has held off as long as possible, and
while we have not yet made any ad
vance in subscription, we are com
pelled to make a slight advance in
advertising rates. Commencing July
1st the rates for display advertising
will be 12% cents per inch to adver
tisers who have space in each issue
during the year, and 15 cents per
inch to all who do not'have an ad
vertisement every week. This is how
ever a lower rate than the papers in
other towns in southern Iowa, with
smaller circulation than The Report
er, are now charging.
Suffrage Was Defeated by More Than
10,000.
Official returns from 97 out of the
99 counties in Iowa shows that the
suffrage constitutional amendment
wa8 defeated by a majority of 10,325
votes. Fifty-one counties gave ma
jorities against suffrage and forty
six for it. The two counties which
have not yet made official returns are
'Ida and Dipkinson, and as the vote
is small in both counties it will make
no great change in the final figures.
Hie fact that a majority of the coun
ties voted against suffrage disputes
the claim that the liquor votes in the
river counties defeated the amend
ment.
Price of Evening Tribune to be Ad
vanced.
We have received notice from the
Des Moines Evening Tribune that
the subscription price of that paper
will be advanced from $2.00 to $3.00
per year on July 1st, the increase
being on account of the high price of
print paper. Until June 30tli, we will
accept new and renewal subscrip
tions at the old club rate of $3.30
per year for The Tribune and Report
er and after that date the club rate
for the two papers will be $4.20. If
your Tribune subscription expires
any time this year it will pay you to
extend it a year before June 30th.
Itepublican Candidates for Governor
Spent a Lot of Money.
The statement of campaign ex
penses filed by the four republican
candidates for governor at the recent
primary election show ,that each man
spent a large sum of money in trying
to secure an office with a salary of
$5,000 a year. Allen spent the great
est sum, $18,231, Harding spent
$10,556, Kuehnle $6,217.74, and!
Cosson $3,581.28. And the worst of
it is that the prospects are that a
democrat E. T. Meredith, is going to
be the next governor of Iowa.
Auto and Motorcycle crash.
Last Thursday afternoon Mrs.
Port Bowsher was driving south on
Main strett, and at the first street
running east north of the depot Joy
Dodge turned into Main street with
his motorcycle, and the two machines
met. Dodge was thrown from his
machine and bruised up consider
ably, and had to have his cuts dress
ed by a physician. The motorcycle
had a wheel mashed and was other
wise broken, while the Ford escaped
with a mashed headlight.
Sold His Clarinila Ice Cream Factory.
P. B. Walker, proprietor of the
Leon Ice Cream Factory, who also
owned a factory at Clarinda, sold the
Clarinda factory last week to Tyler
Bros., of Villisca. He had enjoyed
a fine patronage at Clarinda, but
could not give ft his personal atten
tion, so when the opportunity came
to sell at a good price he sold out,
and Mil devote all of his time to his
business in this city.
Magazine Club Entertains.'
The ladies of the Magazine Club
observed their annual guest day at
'the beautiful country home of Mrs.

noon was spent.

It looks very much as if we were
going to have some serious trouble
with Mexico, following the refusal of
tne United States to withdraw the
troops which are in Mexico. Sunday
President Wilson issued an order to
every governor in the United States,
directing that the state militia of
each state be mobilized at once,
ready to depart for the Mexican bor
der, and the work of mobilizing be
gan on Monday. The Iowa troops
will all assemble at Des Moines where
they will be outfitted and expect to
depart for the Mexican border before
many days. All American hitizens in
Mexico have been advised to leave
that country and battle ships have
been dispatched to Mexican waters..
The state of Iowa will supply about
7,000 troops. The only thing which,
will prevent war now is for Carranza
to back down and permit our troops
to remain in Mexico until the bandits
are captured and peace restored.

Nearly all of the candidates for
county offices at the recent primary

Mexican Trouble Cripples Reporter
Force.
The calling out of the state militia
in every state in anticipation of ser
ious trouble with Mexico, has crippled
The Reporter office force, our efficient
foreman, R. V. McCollum, being a
member of the Bethany, Mo., com
pany, and he received a peremptory
order Monday afternoon to report for
duty at once. Accompanied by Mrs.
McCollum he went to Bethany on the
early morning train Tuesday morn
ing, and has .changed his occupation
from doing job work and setting ad
vertisements to drilling and drawing
the munificent salary of 50 cents a
day. We were mighty sorry to lose
Mc from our force. Fortunately
Claude Beck, an old employe of this
office now with the Homestead at
Des Moines, was visiting in Leon and
lie kindly helped us get out this is
sue, and we hope soon to have a
competent man in the office.

Bad Auto Accident.
Last Saturday evening us Mrs. H.
W. Teale was coming east on Main
street in the Teale car she accidently
ran into Frank Hopkins on the cross
ing between the Lamoni Hardware
and vVhite's. The fender of the car
struck on the back of his neck and
shoulders, bruising him up consider
ably. Mr. Hopkins had been talking
to Fred Goode and Will Anderson and
as near as we can find out did not see
the car coming. This is one of the re
grettable accidents for which no one
can be blamed. As we go to press Mr.
Hopkins is resting easier and it is
thought no serious results will follow
the accident.
This accident brings up the thought
again that we should have some kind
of traffic rule's and make use of traffic
flags through the business part of
town. The people coming to Lamoni
are so great in numbers that some
means will have to be taken to avoid
accidents. There were two cr three
other narrow escapes Saturday where
if we had had some traffic rules and
flags up nothing of the kind would
have happened. Perhaps traffic rules
would nbt have prevented the acci
dent above mentioned but they would
have a tendencey to prevent many
other accidents that will be sure to
happen if we do not properly protect
our traffic.—Lamoni Chhronicle.

faction.

Imagine seeing unfolded before
your eyes the advance on Warsaw,
along a fifty-mile front the crew of
the Emden, the destroyer of com
merce, landing at Constantinople.
It is useless to attempt to describe
"Germany on the Firing Line" pic
tures. There is too much of them
crowded into six reeis. It would be
like attempting to write a year's
history of the great war in a couple
of paragraphs. The pictures tell in a
few inches what it would take vol
umes to descrine properly.
Enough to say that the films are
the official pictures of the German
government. No correspondent, how
ever favored, no commercial photo
grapher, however much he might bid
for the privilege, nor any group of
correspondents or photographers
could hope to get together a collec
tion of pictures the equal of these
taken for the government.
The pictures were taken while the
big Krupp guns were still roaring
and the smoke hung heavy over the
field of battle while battered walls
were still falling in beseiged towns
while the wounded were being rush
ed off the field in stretchers and hur
ried to the emergency hospitals. They
were taken while bullets and shells
were flying near the men who were
turning the handles of the moving
picture machine.
There has been no attempt at sen
sationalism in the pictures they are
grim enough in their present form.
They tell the story of the war as a
plain, unvarnished truth.

orado, Democrat, giving an exten
sive write-up of Lincoln county, and
its citizens, we find the following
flattering mention of two former
well known Decatur county people,
John R. Beavers and his sister, Miss
Lennie, both of whom were for sev
eral years successful teachers in this
county:
This review would be incomplete
without prominent mention of Hon.
J. R. Beavers. Mr. Beavers has
made his home in Lincoln county for
the Ipst ten years, and has succeeded
botii in a material way and the mak
ing of friends and supporters
among our people.
Mr. Beavers is a great believer in
our coutitry, antj, is always ready to
back his judgment. He is now serv
ing as the registrar of the Unitod
States land office in Hugo. He was
formerly at Calhan, where he held
the position of principal of the Cal
han school, which position he also
held in the Hugo school prior to his
appointment to the land office ser
vice.
Hugo can not boast of a more pub
lic spirited man than Mr. Beavers.
Miss Lennie Beavers, who is one
of the best primary teachers in east
ern Colorado, received her training
above the high school at Highland
Park College at Des Moines, Iowa,
and at the Iowa State Teachers' Col-,
lege.
Miss Beavers taught four years in
the graded schools of Iowa before
coining to Colorado, where she has
taught six years, five of which has
been in our home town.
Miss Beavers has the true western
spirit, having proved up on a home
stead in Lincoln county, and at the
same time been loyal to the educa
tional interests of our section of the
state.
Her primary methods are among
the best and she commands at all
times the love and respect of the
children and the patrons.
