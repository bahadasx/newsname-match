WHY ACT WAS NOT SIGNED.
I
Governor Manning Explains Position
? on Two-quart Law.
Columbia, June 17.?In answer to
a letter inquiring about the two-quart
act, Gov. Manning wrote as follows:
"In the beginning permit me to
state that I am very glad indeed that
your interest in the administration
. of affairs of government and in the
, enforcement of law in South Carolina
is such that you feel free to write me
in reference to the two-quart bill.
I am. glad to have the opportunity to
, advise you that my refusal to sign
this bill at the present time is purely
; in the interest of temperance in South
Carolina, and with all regard for the
views of its advocates and with great
admiration for their high purpose and
fine service.
"You will recall that the legisla,
ture at its 1915 session passed what
, is known as the gallon-a-month act.
This same legislature passed an act
referring the question of prohibition
, or local option to the voters of South
Carolina in a special election held in
, September, 1915.
"It has been claimed by some that
there are constitutional defects in the
gallon-a-month law) As the head of
the executive department of the State
I would not presume to pass on this
question. That is a matter for the
judicial department. My duty is to
direct the enforcement of this act so
long as it remains on the statute
books unchanged by legislative enactment
or judicial decision.
Pending in Court.
"I have been informed that this
law is now being tested in the courts,
and the friends of prohibition having
knowledge of this action introduced
during the 1916 session of the legislature
a bill intended to reenact
+ orollnn.Q.mnnth law in Qllph a
lUlO goil'lvuu uivuvu twii ? ?
manner as to leave no question as to
its constitutionality. When this bill
was introduced and finally passed
/
through both houses of the general
assembly, a good many changes had
been made in it and a number of
amendments tacked on. In fact, the
act as finally passed was widely different,
I am told, from the bill originally
introduced. When this act
came to me for approval or disapproval,
I discussed the entire matter
with the authors of the bill, together
with some of the leading prohibitionists
of the State. In addition to
the advice and counsel gained from
these gentlemen, who are very much
interested in the cause of prohibition,
I received a large number of
letters from citizens in various parts
of the State, urging me for various
reasons not to approve this act.
Liquor ad Libitum?
"This condition confronted me:
The gallon-a-month act was before
the courts and this new act, if signed,
would automatically repeal the gallon-a-month
act; and in case it was
attacked and set aside by the courts,
we would be left without any legal
limitation upon the amount of liquor
that might be imported.
"It seemed to me, therefore, that
in view of the information that had
been placed before me, the highest
interests of the State would best be
served were I to hold this act in
abeyance rather than take chances.
For these and other reasons which I
deem inadvisable to make public at
the present time, I deemed it in the
interest of temperance and in fairness
to the people of the State that
the two-quart act be not signed at
present, but that it be held here pending
the outcome of the legal fight on
the gallon-a-month act. The twoquart
act has not been vetoed, but is
merely held in this office as above
stated.
"I have written you frankly in ref
erence to the matter and I trust you
will understand and appreciate my
position. The principle of law enforcement
is very dear to my heart
and in m<y opinion is of paramount
importance in South Carolina at the
present time. I am doing all in my
power to see that the present laws
are enforced and shall continue this
policy with unabated vigor and without
compromise so long as I am governor.
"Vox Populi."
"Since the State has spoken so
clearly for prohibition, it becomes
the duty of a Democrat and certainly
that of a public official to accept the
expression of the will of the peopie
as the policy of the State. It seems
to me, therefore, that we have had
our course determined by a greatly
preponderant vote, and so far as I am
concerned the liquor question is a
settled one. It is no longer a political
issue. The people have spoken
in no uncertain terms on the matter.
"I take this occasion to state that

CANVAS BOOK COVERS.

Done in Cross Stitch They Are Quaint
and Artistic.
If you like to give the artistic
touch to your books by making covers
for them of fine canvas you may
work them in the old-fashioned cross
stitch exactly like that used by our
great-grandmothers. The fccover is
made the same as the calico and
gingham cover for school books used ,
to be made, but on the outer side
little conventional designs and the
name are worked. Sometimes the
only working will be the name. All
of us have a few books which are
very dear because of association, or
thA helnfiilness af their contents, but
the bindings have become worn and
shabby. The canvas binding in cross
stitcb. is not only pretty, but it is
quaint and .will save the books.?

AMPAIGN OPENS IEESDAY
AXDIDATES ADDRESS SPARTANBURG
VOTERS.
bout 1,000 Present at the Meeting,
About Half Being From Other
Counties.
Spartanburg, June 20.?Devoid of
jatures and likened by many season3
campaigners to a Sunday-school
icnic, the initial meeting of the
junty-to-county canvass of candiates
took place here today. The
leeting began in the court house,
ut was adjourned to the outside,
here the candidates stood on a dry
oods box under the low-hanging
ranches of a water oak and addressi
the people. The tree under which
le candidates stood was so thick
nd the limbs so close to them that
ley had to stoop to see the people
n tne outer rringe or tne crowa.
Of the 1,000 people present, not
ver half were citizens of Spartanurg,
the others coming from sur[>unding
counties, some as far away
s Columbia. There was absolutely
o enthusiasm and very little aplause,
one campaigner, who has paricipated
in county and State camaigns
since 1898, dubbing the Sparinburg
meeting "the worst farce I
ave ever seen."
The candidates for governor led
fif, being given twenty-four minutes
ach. Former Governor C. L. Blease
tarted the ball to rolling with an
ttack on the record of Mr. Manning
s senator and governor. He said
ae administration had been run exravagantly,
many useless offices ereted,
and that much lawlessness had
iken place in the last two years,
le also jumped on the pardoning
ecord of the governor.
Robert A. Cooper, the next guberatnrial
nanriiriata tn snpalr said hp
ras in the race on his own account
nd was not brought out by any
Lique or interest. He stressed law
uforcement and advocated a State
lsurance rate-making bureau. Mr.
ooper advocated extension of the
dpcation privileges of every child.
J. M. Deschamps was the third guernatorial
candidate to address the
oters and he outlined the magnifisnt
opportunity now before South
arolina. He called on the people
) get together and work in unity
long all lines. He said he wanted
ocational training in the schools, opDsed
capital punishment and called
a the people to interest themselves
l constructive measures and do
way with factionalism and strife.
John T. Duncan came next in the
ubernatorial candidates. He chargi
that the State warehouse system
as being built up into a political
lachine, and reiterated his wellnown
attack on a "system."
Governor Richard I. Manning bean
his speech with an appeal to emloyers
of National Guardsmen to
snd every cooperation to the soldiers
) respond to the call of the presient
and, touching on the record of
le Palmetto regiment in the Mexim
war of 1845, said he knew South
arolina today ^vould maintain that
lorious reputation. He congratuited
the people and the National
uardsmen on the prompt and unaniious
response of the militia to the
lobilization orders. The governor
[so praised President Wilson. He
^viewed the work of his administraon.
Attorney General Thomas H. Peeles,
Comptroller General Carlton W.
awyer and Superintendent of Edu- ition
J. E. Swearingen, who are unpposed
for reelection, made short
idresses, in which they thanked the <
sople and pledged anew their best
in their offices. i
Dr. E. C. L. Adams, of Columbia,
>r lieutenant governor, ridiculed the 1
ord peace expedition to Europe and 1
ieutenant Governor Bethea for goig
a member of it. He pictured Mr. 1
ethea as weeping on the neck o 1
William Jennings Bryan and said 1
lat as a pacifist he was in opposi- !
on to President Wilson.
Lieutenant Governor Andrew J.
ethea favored four-year terms for
Beers, biennial sessions of the gen al
assembly, education and praised
ie record of the Democracy.
By the time the candidates for

Brother Believes Newberry College
Tutor to Be ill Canada.
Columbia, June 16.?Information
received in Columbia yesterday
would indicate that Fred D. MacLean,
the young tutor at Newberry college
who mysteriously disappeared May
14, has crossed the border of the
United States into Canada and has /
joined the forces of the dominion in
either Ottawa or Toronto. President
Harms, of Newberry college, explained
over the telephone last night that
a letter had been received from a
brother, W. M. MacLean, superintendent
of public schools in Topeka.
Kan., intimating that all traces of
his movements led to this conclusion.
The brother in Kansas has been following
up all possible clues since his
disappearance last month. President
Harms further expressed the opinion
that he did not believe the young
man had been the victim of foul
play and believes that the matter will
be cleared up soon.
Investigation into the Columbia
end of the case yesterday developed
that Young MacLean registered at
* *, "
the Imperial hotel on Saturday afternoon,
May 13; occupying for the
night room 235. The hotel record
shows that he paid his bill Sunday
noon and checked out.
President Harms came to Columbia
on Monday, May 15, and by' a
strange coincidence was assigned the
room that had been occupied by Mr.
MacLean. Dr. Harms said that he

Columbia. When the young man
f. '
left Newberry he told his friends
that* he would return Monday.
Young MacLean was treasurer of
the athletic association at Newberry
college and left all accounts properly
checked. He also had $90 to his
credit in one of the Newberry banks
and had a salary balance of $200 due
him. ,
He was a member of the class of
1915. During the four years of his
college course he did clerical work
in the office of President Harms and
was in the -close confidence at all
times of the administration. He was
captain of the college football eleven ; 1
and had numerous other college
honors to his credit. During the past
session he has been a tutor in the
institution and was favorably known
throughout the city as well as in the
college community. His home is in
Youngstown,, Ohio.
TO THE BACHELORS. ? j
Hints to Those Who are Contemplating
Matrimony.
In the June Woman's Home Companion
is an article, entitled "How I
Made a Good Husband of My Son,"
1-T--L 1 J ' V'1
in wmcn me writer lays uuwu sumo
rules for a course of domestic training
for bachelors, who are thinking
of being married.
"Besides heating the house," he
says, "a man should have a thorough
theoretical and a simple practical
knowledge of plumbing, so he can be
beyond the mercy of an ignorant or *
dishonest plumber. The upkeep of
all the furniture is your province;
you should be able to replace a cas^
tor automatically, or in your sleep
put on the pull of a bureau drawer.
"Of course, he will not call in a
painter when floors or woodwork
need painting or a man to replace
panes of glass or put up shelves, or
any of the smaller tinkering around
the house, any more than his ^rife
should hire a woman to darn the
stockings or do the small mending.
"One of the most important duties
is to see that each window and
door is properly screened. He should
keep all the shades in proper order
and see that the windows work easily
and smoothly, also keep the locks
of all doors in perfect order. He
should have a general knowledge of
building materials, so he will be able
to advise his carpenter. Naturally,
too, he will keep the knives in proper
condition, and no young man
should wait until he is married to
loarn hnw tr? rsrvp."
