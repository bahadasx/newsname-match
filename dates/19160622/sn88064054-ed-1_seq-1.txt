LUMBER MARKET ANY
THING BUT PROMISING
Over Production Said To
Bie Cause Of Present
Conditions
The conditions in the lumber in
dustry are far from promising. In
spite of the volume of big recent
orders, the mills of the country
have been producing at too heavy
a rate, and unless there is a change.
the statistics indicate that there
may be reason to fear a return of
the depression which marked 1913
and 1914. The chart prepared
each month by the National Lum
ber Manufacturers Association in
dicates that the volume of produc
tion has passed the volume of
shipments and orders, and that
production is increasing while ship
ments are decreasing.
This condition, however, is being -
recognized in some sections of the
country by the manufacturers.
On the West Coast, many mills are
curtailing production, by shorten
ing the hours of operation of their
mills materially, Some of the
smaller mills have not thought such
a course necessary, but the larger,
producers are realizing that the cur
tailing of production is an economic
necessity of the industry.
The Southern Pine manufactur
ers are also in many instances be
ginning to curtail production. Such
curtailment is in no way general,
but is rather a sporadic realization
of the need of preventing overpro
duction to an extent that might
seriously affect general business in
the industry,
GUERRE MADE MAJOR AND
OTHER OFFICERS PROMOTED
Good news was received at the
camp of Company "G" Tuesday
afternoon in a message announc
ing that Capt. L. F. Guerre had

means that both have received a
fine promotion, and according to
the duties Major Guerre will have
charge of four companies while
Reg. Adj. Schaffer will be right hand
officer to Col. Stubbs. The appoint
ment is a reward of faithful work
and a compliment to Bogalusa and
the local militia.
An election was held Tuesday
afternoon to fill the vacancies
Scaused by the promotion of Major
SGuerre and Reg. Adj. Schaffer when

PROCLAMATION
Bogalusa, La., June 19th, 1916.
Citizens:
It has been the custom ever since the birth of Bo
galusa to celebrate the Fouth of July, Since the, inauguration
of the City of Bogalusa, this has been done in a large way, the
merchants and other citizens contributing largely to the ex
pense of this annual celebration. Committees have been or
ganized and have commenced work on the celebration of the
Fourth this year, all of the people of Bogalusa contributing in
a very liberal way to the expense. About $1,200 has been
raised for this purpose.
Company "G" and its eighty-five members, made up en
tirely of young men and citizens of Bogalusa, have been call.
ed to the colors. It seems fitting that, instead of spending all
of the above money for the various forms of amusements of
the Fourth of July, this money all to be deposited in the bank
to the credit of the Patriotic Committee, which will be com
posed of women and men, citizens of Bogalusa, to render as
sistance to those who by reason of the absence of some mem
ber of their family on whom they are dependent for support,
After talking with a number of citizens, it was decided
that the Mayor issue a Proclamation that we should have only
a Preparedness Parade and speaking at 12 o'clock noon in the
Park, on the Fourth. All business, professional and other men
young and old, should take part in the Preparedness Parade.
Any money that you plan on spending to decorate floats,
be good enough to pay to the Treasurer, Mr. W. M. Babington.
Let's all make liberal contributions and start the Patriotic
Committee with plenty of funds. Let it be said that Bogalusa
has furnished one of the best Companies that has been called
to the colors, and that the citizens of Bogalusa are doing their
part in taking care of the families left behind,
Given under my hand and seal of the City of Bogalusa
this nineteenth day of June, 1916.
W. H. SULLIVAN.
Mayor.
FOURTH-OF JULY PROGRAM
CHANIGED TO MEET CONDITIONS
Big Parade Will Be Given And 1000 Or More Expected
To March--Speaking In Park, Athletic Events
Program Will Be Interesting
In view of the fact that the i
United States now faces war with
Mexico, the elaborate Fourth of
July celebration which was planned
has been called off. However, a
celebration in keeping with the
new situation will be observed.
Inasmuch as 100 Bogalusa citizens
will likely be called to the front,
Mayor Sullivan made the sugges
tion that the fund which had been
subscribed to the Fourth of July
be used for the benefit of the Boga
lusa troops. The suggestion was
hailed with delight in every sec
tion of the city, and numbers who
had not yet been called upon to
contribute to the Fourth of July
fund, announced that they would
gladly give for the Bogalusa boys
who will be called to the front.
As the celebration stood yester
day, it was decided to elaborate
more on the Preparedness Parade
than had been first figured, and it
PATRIOTIC MASS MEETING TO
BE HELD SUNDAY AT 4:30 P. M.
Bogalusa citizens, men, women]
and children, who believe in as
sisting their country and who take
pride in the local troops, are re
quested to be at Goodyear Park
Sunday afternoon at 4:30 p. m.
when a mass meeting will be held
to decide what steps Bogalusa shall
take in the crisis which appears cer
tain with Mexico. One hundred
of Bogalusa's citizens have been
mobilized and are waiting a call at
any minute to leave for the Mexi
can border where they will play a
prominent part in the war which
now appears certain. No few of
these troops will leave families be
hind, and the absence of the troops
C. J. Wade, auditor of the N. O. G.
N., will leave tomorrow for an ex
tended visit in the North and East.
He will visit Boston, New York,

is hoped that 1500 citizens of Wash
ington Parish will march in the
parade on the Fourth. There will
be speaking in the park, athletic
events and many other amuse
ments, prizes of which will be do
nated by the local merchants. The
refreshments will be sold under the
auspices of the committee, and the
profits will be placed in the fund
for the Bogalusa soldiers. Accord
ing to the plans, these will be de
void of noise and expense. Colum
bia street fire department will give'
an exhibition when they will at
tempt to show how easy it is to fight
fires with good equipment. Boga
lusa folks and the visitors will find
a wholesome program that they are
certain to enjoy. Pictures will be
shown in the Park on the evening
and those who contemplated com
ing here for the celebration can rest
assured that they will enjoy the
Sday.
may he one year or longer. There
are many things that the citizens
of Bogalusa can do for the men
who go to the front, and the fami
lies who are left behind. Men who
are willing to face possible death
for the defense of the country should
have the patriotic consideration and
service of those who remain at
home. This will possibly be the
only invitation you will receive to
attend this patriotic meeting. Show
your true allegiance to the flag that
floats over ou" land, your pride in
the local trooDs, and be at this
meeting Sunday afternoon prompt
ly at 4:30.

of the N. O. G. N., accompanied by
Mrs. Williams left Monday afternoon
for Boston, New York, Atlantic
City, and Philadelphia where they
will visit for about a month.
Mrs. L. M. Vignes and sons Bert
and Ernest. of Morgan La., are
visiting Mrs. G. E. Thomas.
DECLARATION OF WAR EXPECTED :
BETWEEN U.S. AND MEXICO HOURL
Militia Of Entire Country Called To Colors And De
claration Of War Expected By The End Of
W'eek--U. S. Prepared For Siruggle
Not since the sinking of the
Main there has never been a time l
when patriotism was as. high as LL
since Monday when announcement
was made that the United States is
on the verge of war with Mexico
and that only a miracle can avert
hostilities. In Bogalusa orders were
received at 2 o'clock Monday morn
ing for Company G to mobilize and
a few minutes later young men
were aroused from their sleep and
reported to their superiors. At rec
daylight when citizens learned of the
the orders, patriotism developed wil
that made the men who had seen
service want to enlist. Wherever ha
men met the sole discussion was an
the question of war. Early Monday of
morning the' troops, who were be
stationed in Goodyear Park were w
drilled, and hundreds looked with
pride upon the Bogalusa men who ti
are expected to be called into ser- fa(
vice any minute. A recruiting ga
station was opened,,. and Bogalusa thb
will be able to send a full company an
of 100 within a few minutes after
orders are received to entrain. th
About a score of members of Com- fri
pany "G" are scattered over this k[
and adjoining states. Six mem- do
bers who were at (amp Oglethorpe, th
arrived home Tuesday morning. al
On Tuesday the camp quarters tj
were moved to the Y. M. C. A. a
grounds where the new recruits
were drilled and more recruits
taken. In all there will be about
30 recruits and Bogalusa has an
opportunity of having two compa- L
nies within a short time.
e Following the order to mobilize, w
Mayor Sullivan, also Gen. Mgr. of
the Great Southern Lumber Co., an
nounced that his company would
pay a certain amount to the mar
ried employes of the Great Southern c
who were members of the militia.
It was his suggestion to turn the S
d Fourth of July Fund to a fund for i,
. the troops and their families which c
is one of the most laudable sugges
tions ever made, and which
met with the hearty approval of
t. every man and woman in Bogalu
t sa.
- Capt. L. F. Guerre, of Company
d "G" does not know when the troops
e will be ordered out of the city,
e possibly within the next few hours,
g and again it may be three or four
- days. Meanwhile, business has al
et most been suspended in Bogalusa. f
e Those who have not given any- i
thing to the fund are requested to
- phone the amount and send check
to W. M. Babington, of the Firsts
State Bank, W. P. Haley, of thel
I. Washington Bank & Trust Company
and Clyde S. Moss of the Enterprise.

ncan be raised as over $1100 had
i- been subscribed to the celebration.
