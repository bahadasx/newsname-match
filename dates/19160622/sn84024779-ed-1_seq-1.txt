El Paso, June 22.—The Carpi-
sal battle means that war has be-
gun with Mexico. Ameriean army?
officers see but one thing to do
and that is to press the fight. It
is believed here that Qeneral
Pershing already has placed his
entire oommand in aotion against
the Mexieans who have been sur-
rounding him for days and press-
ing him hourly.
Americans here are confident
that the 17 troopers captured
were killed enroute if they were
ever started for Chihuahua, as the
Mexican law of flight has been re-the
instated sinoe the threatened
clash with the United States.
Reports of the battle brought to
El Paso by American refugees
said the American cavalry had
been fired upon at close range
with machine guns by the Mexi
cans, and that the Americans lit
erally were mowed down before
they could make a move.
Details from Co. I left this
morning for the several towns in
this city to get recruits for the
company to bring it up to the
authorized war strength of 150
men.

I perhaps what it was he bored into
it with a wire, it exploded, taking

The peculiar part of the accid

THE NEXT PRESIDENT
The next. President of the Unit
ed States will be Robert Lansing,
of New York, the present Secre
tary of Slate.
This is not in the nature of a
wild political prediction, nor is it
the inauguration of a boom-for a
Democratic 'dark horse" it is
merely the statement of a fact
which, barring the death or resig
nation of Secretary Lansing, is as
certain as anything can be.
Mr. Lansing's term of office
does not depend upon the action
jof any political convention it is
ilikewise irrespective of any pri
mary or direct election. In point
of fact, it dales back to January
ID, 1880. when Congress passed
an act providing that, in the event
of the dealh, removal, resignation
or in.-.hility of both the President
ami .he Vice-President of the
United Slates, the Secretary of
State shall act as President.
March I. 1917. will fall upon a
Sunday, and it is contrary to all
precedent—
although not in oppo
sition lo any law—to hold an in
auguration on Sunday. Therefore
the incoming Chief Executive will
lake Ihe oath of office and com
mence his term shortly after noon
on March 5. President Wilson's
term romme.nced al noon on
March 4th, 11)13 therefore, ac
cording to the Constitution, which
defines the term of a President as
"four years'' his tenure of office
will be over at noon on March 4
and. even if he is elected to suc
ceed himself, he cannot take the
oath of office until noon on tliu
following day. Vice-President
Marshall, of course, is under the
same disability as the President.
Therefore the Secretary of Slate.
Mr. Lansing will he President of
the United States for the twenty
four hours and some minutes
elapsing between noon on Sunday
March 4th, and the time that the
n?w President takes the oath of
off..in ttie following day.
This brief term of office is not
a mere formality. It is an actual
occupation of the power of Presi
dent. with all his authorities and
prerogatives. Mr. Lansing
"President Lansing'' for the day—
,will be empowered to occupy the
White House, to issue pardons, to
attend to all the other business of
[Which the Chief Executive has
Iconii-ol. and to ride to the Capitol,
should he so desire, as the outgo
ing President on Inauguration
Day.
Moreover, this is Ihe first lime
:iii the history of tin nation that a
Secretary of Stale has had this
honor bestowed upon him and on
ly the second time in Ihe 140
years of the existence of (lie
United United Slates lhal the of
fice
has been held by any one oth
er than the President, or Ihe Vice
President.
On January lit. 1880, Congress
passed the bill which provided for
111" sucession (o the Presidency
through the Cabinet, commencing
wilh file Secretary of Slate and
passing on through Ihe Secretary
of War, the Attorney General, the
Postmaster General. I lie Secretary
of ihe Navy and Ihe Secretary of
•Ihe Interior. The oilier cabinet of
fices rank in Ihe order of their
establishment.
Since the foundation of the
government Cabinet officers at
(he close of one Administration
have held over into a new Admin
istration until their successors
have been appointed a.iid eon
jlirmed and have qualified.
The tenure of office act of
!March 2, 1867, reads: "Every per
son holding any civil office to
which he has been or hereafter
may be appointed by and with Ibe
advice and consent of the Senate,
land who shall have become duly
jiiualilied to act therein, shall be
entitled to hold such office during
the lerin for which lie was ap
pointed, unless sooner removed by
.and with the advice and consent
of Ibe Senate, or by Ihe appoint
jmcnt, with the like advice and
jCunsent, of a successor in his
place."
The coming commission issued
by the President, to Mr. Lansing
specifies no term whatever, al
though it contains Ihe phrase
••during (he pleasure of Ihe Pres
ident of the United Stales for the
time being." The reasons for this
saving clause are quite apparent,
and the mention of the name of
William Jennings Bryan in the
message of the President to the
Senate causes one to wonder
whether the Commoner was aware
that, if he remained in office un
til March 4 next, he would be the
•twenty-ninth President of the
United States—if only for a day.
