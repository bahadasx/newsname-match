WOODROW VVILSON, PRESIDENT.
PLATFORM ADOPTED;
SESSION ADJOURNS
St. Louis The Democratic National
Convention finished its work Friday by
adopting the party platform exactly as
approved by President Wilson and sub
mitted by the resolutions committee,
including the planks on Americanism
and favornig woman suffrage, but not
until the harmony of its three days
session had been rippled with a row
over the suffrage plank.
No voice was raised against the
declarations of the Amricanism plank,
At one time it looked as if the suffrage
plank had been loBt, but after Senator
Walsh, of Montana, bad told the con
vention that President Wilson himself
considered it vital to party success it
was voted into the platform, 8881 to
1811. The whole platform then was
adopted without roll call.
As it went into the platform the
suffrage plank stands:
We favor, the extension of the
franchise to the women of thiB coun
try. state by state, on the same terms
as to the men."
The women suffrage leaders consid
ered it a much more favorable declara
tion than they got from the Republi
can convention at Chicago; they threw
all their force behind it and won the
support of the administration leaders,
who were found fighting for them
when danger threatened.
Haggared and worn from an all
night session, the platform makers
were not ready with their report until
afternoon, when Senator Stone, sleep
less for more than SO hours, took the
speaker'a stand to read the document
gave over this task to Senator Walah,
of Montana, and Senator Hollis, of
New Hampshire. They "spelled"
each other reading the long declara
tion.
The fight on the suffrage plank was
in the air. Every body was keyed up
to it when at the conclusion of the
reading of the platform Martin Lomas
ney, of Boston, a delegate, claimed the
attention of the chair, it was thought
that he was opening the fight. It was
several minutes before the shouts of
approval and cries of disapproval could
be Btilled sufficiently to hear that he
wanted to put the convention on record
as sympathizing with "the people of
Ireland."
Raus mit him, " roared a Baltimore
delegate and the convention hall
rocked with laughter.
The real fight broke immediately
after, however, when Governor Fer-

guson, of Texas, who headed the mi
nority report against the administra
tion plank, was given 30 minutes in
which to discuss it
The plank offered by the minority
was this:
"The Democratic party has always
stood for the sovereignty of the sev
eral states in the control and regula
tion of elections. We ' reaffirm the
historic position of our party in this
regard and favor the continuance of
that wise provision of the federal con
stitution which vests in the several
states of the union the power to pre
scribe the qualifications of their elec
tors."
Marksmanship Declared Bad.
Berlin Officers of the German
cruisers Elbing and Frauenlob inter
viewed in the Frankfurter Zeitung
emphasize what they describe as the
extraordinarily bad markmanship
of the British gunners in the North
Sea battle.
For a long peroid, they declare, the
Elbing was exposed to the continuous
heavy fire of British dreadnaughts and
a single fair hit would have sufficed to
sink her, but she was not hit once.
Airmen Work Near Suez Canal.
London The following official com
munication concerning the operations
in Egypt was made public Tuesday
night: "Hostile aeroplanes bombard

Said on the Suez canal and a machine
gun fired on Roman! Tuesday. They
were driven off by British aircraft
with a few minor casualties at Kan
tara. No one was injured at Romani.
CONVENTION ACTS
IN HARMONY
Coliseum, St. Louis President Wil
son and Vice President Marshall were
nominated by acclamation late Thurs
day night by the Democratic National
convention, the ticket being completed
four minutes before Friday.
Contrary to expectation, however,
the convention did not finish its work,
because the platform was not ready,
and it met again at 11 o'clock Friday
morning.
It was announced in the convention
that the sub-committee drafting the
platform had finished its work, but
that the entire resultions committee
was not assembled to pass upon it, and
it was not known when that could be
done.
President Wilson's own plank,
charging conspiracy among some foreign-born
citizens for the benefit of
the foreign powers and denouncing any
political party which benefits and not
repudiating such a situation, was in
corporated in the platform just as the
President himself had sent it from
Washington. It was understood that
the President insisted that the plank
should be put in the platform in the
way he had drawn it.
There never was any doubt of Presi
dent Wilson's nomination, but there
was a possibility that some vice-presidential
booms might be brought put in
opposition to Vice President Marshall.
They melted away, however, when
the convention got in session, and as
soon as President Wilson's nomination
had been made a roaring chorus of ac
clamation, Senator Kern, who re-nominated
.Mr. Marshall, cast aside a long
prepared speech and simply declared :
"I nominate Thomas Riley Marshall,
of Indiana, for vice president."
To President Wilson's nomination
there was only one dissenting vote,
Robert Emmett Burke, of Illinois, who
came to the convention declaring that
he was opposed to the President. His
vote technically made the President's
nomination 1091 to 1.
A striking' incident of the session
was the action of the convention in
calling on William J. Bryan to speak.
This was done on the motion of Sena
tor Thompson, of Kansas, that the
rules be suspended and the ex-secretary
be permitted to take the plat
form. The motion was carried and
Mr. Bryan was escorted to the plat
form immediately.
He spoke 45 minutes, pledging his
support to the President.

in Hood River.
According to W. T. Andrews lod
ging engineer, and Assistant District
Forester F. E. Ames, who were here
recently from Portland, the total
stumpage of proposed fir sales reaches
approximately 360,000,000 feet. Ap
plication to have the forest area open
ed and offered for sale was made the
past ' winter by J. W. Palmer, a local
West Side orchardist, who baa had
many years of experience in the lum
ber business on the Lower Columbia.
car. raimer is a prospective bidder on
the huge tract.
The mission of Messrs. Andrews and
Ames here concerned a letter from the
local commercial club. The missive.
written several weeks ago, asking for
information on the proposed sale, ex
pressed the fear that the denudation
of so large an area might be a menace
to the irrigation system of the valley
ana was considered by the Forest Serv
ice as an indirect protest against the
sale.
Mr. Ames explained that the timber
would be cut after the usual manner of
logging in Douglas fir regions. It will
take probably from 10 to 12 years to
cut the entire-acreage. Once or twice
each year the slashings will be burned
over, every precaution being taken to
guard against damage to adjoining na
tional forest acreage, as well as pat
ented timber lands.
We find," said Mr. Ames, "that
reforestation of fir takes place most
readily after burning. We anticipate
from experience that we have bad in
other similar locations that reseeding
will be ample and that within a short
time the acreage will not only be cov
ered with young firsbut also a dense
undergrowth that wffl tend to conserve
rainfall as well as the forest trees that
will be taken off. By the time the
last of the timber is removed refor
estation of the first burned slashings
win nave taken place."
Mr. Ames further showed that the
area embodied in the proposed aale
does not extend to the source of the
west fork of Hood River, which in
fact is fed by glaciers and would be
affected in no way by cutting of the
timber.
The government officials explained
that 25 per cent of the funds realized
from the proposed sale will be appor
tioned among Hood River, Clackamas
and Wasco counties, proportionate to
the area of the National forest within
their bounds. Ten per cent of the re
turns will be spent in building roads
or trails in the National forests of the
state.
Following the explanation of the
forestry officials, the commercial club
members assembled at the specially
called meeting and voted unanimously
in an enthusiastic approval of the pro
posed timber sale.
for Withdrawal
of Pershing's Expedition Brings
Crisis in Border Trouble.
Washington, ' D. C. Virtually the
entire mobile strength of the National
guard of all states and the District of
Columbia was ordered mustered Into the
Federal service Sunday night by Presi
dent Wilson. About 100,000 men are
expected to respond to the calL
They will be mobilized immediately
for such service on the Mexiean border
as may be assigned to them. General
Frederick Funs ton, commanding the
border forces, will designate the time
and place for movement of guardsmen
to the international line aa the occa
sion shall require.
In announcing the orders Secretary
Baker said the state forces would be
employed only to guard the border,
and that no additional troop movements
into Mexico were contemplated except
in pursuit of raiders.
Simultaneously with the National
guard calL Secreary Daniels, of the
Navy debarment, ordered additional
war vessels to Mexican waters on both
coasts to safeguard American lives. .
Within the last two weeks, however.
tension has been increasing steadily.
The crisis presented by General Car
ranza's note demanding the recall of
General Pershing's expeditionary force
has been followed by a virtual ultima
tum served on the American officer by
General Trevino, the Mexican com
mander in ChiLuahua. To this waa '
added Sunday the possibility that
American and Mexican troops had
clashed across the border from San
Benito, Texas.
Mia of Every State ia Union
Called for Guard Duty oa Border
Washington, D. C President Wil
son has called out the militia of every
state for service on the Mexican bor
der.
In announcing the President's decis
ion late Sunday, Secretary Baker said
the militia would be Bent to the border
whenever and as fully as General Fun
ston determines them to be needed.
Brigadier General Alfred Mills,
chief of the division of militia ' affairs,
estimated the minimum militia force
which would respond to the call as
100,000 men.
Promoter Secures Coos Bay
Options for Vast Development
Marshfield W. J. Wilsey, who of-
fered Coos Bay what he said was $10,
000,000 worth of industries in ex
change for good will and encourage
ment, left Coos Bay on Thursday, after
having been welcomed all over the
Coos Bay district and treated cordially
in offerings of property he desired to
accumulate. North Bend held a rous
ing meeting one night and leading citi
zens spoke a welcome that could not be
misconstrued.
Mr. Wilsev's promises were so ex.
tensive that some thought them over a
couple of dayB before committing
themselves to belief in his ability to
carry them through, but before he left
everybody seemed to be convinced.
People had boosted ever since Coos
Bay was a rivulet, but nothing sub
stantial excepting sawmills were es
tablished. It was asserted at the
North Bend meeting that miles of
water front, areas of land for indus
tries, timbered lands on the peninsula,
watersheds, were being held by per
sons who never had any intention of
utilizing them. These, the boosters
said, they would engage to secure at
reasonable figures, and expect them to
be converted into active commercial
properties. . .
Mr. Wilsey, when he left, had op
tions on all the Simpson Lumber com
pany holdings, on the L. D. Kinney
properties, on a large share of the
Flanagan estate holdings on the penin
sula, and on 8000 acres of coal land.
Probably 60 to 75 per cent of the prop-!
erty asked for was under option when
Mr. Wilsey departed for New York.
- Oregon Guard Mobilizing.
Salem Immediate mobilization of
all the units of the Oregon National
guard was ordered Sunday night by
Governor Withycombe, who notified
Adjutant General White to proceed
with mobilization upon receipt of an
urgent message from Secretary of War
Baker, requesting such action.
In his message to the governor, the
Secretary declared that he was in
structed by the .President to request
the mobilization of all the National
guards of the different states.
Washington Militia Gathering. '
Seattle Adjutant General Maurice
Thompson, of the Washington National
guard, received orders, early Sunday
night for the mobilization of the
Washington militia. The Washington
militia will mobilize at American
Lake, south of Tacoma.

Idaho To Be Ready In Three Days.
Boise, Idaho Adjutant General P.
H. Crow said Idaho will mobilize 1000
guardsmen within three days. The men

midnight Sunday. -
War Declared In Redding,
Redding, CaL About 50 Mexicans
who are employed on an irrigation
ditch construction gang near here en
gaged in a street fight with several
Americans here Sunday night in the
restricted district. After the disturb
ance was quelled by the police, aided
by deputy sheriffs, 15 Mexicans were
placed in jail, many of them severely
injured. Knives, stones, clubs and
fists were the weapons used by the
fighters. Six men were stabbed.
