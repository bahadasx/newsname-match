Princeton Diamond Stars Get Long
End of 4 to 3 Scor *he
Fair Grounds Sundi.
Large Gathering of Fans Witness the
Sensational ContestNo
Game Next Sunday.
The Princeton baseball team carved
another initial in the background of
local athletic history last Sunday. Bra
ham's haughty pastimers were the
latest victims of the prowess of the
locals, and it was as close a contest
as has been seen in these parts for
some time. At the conclusion of hos
tilities Princeton was "burdened" with
the heavy end of a 4 to 3 count.
Wilkes was again on the hill top for
Princeton, and his salary arm was
working fine. Only five scattered blows
were registered off of his delivery, and
his rapid shoots and slants kept the
oposition guessing all the time. He
performed in his usual superb style.
Skahen was behind the bat and com
ment is scarcely necessary. His abil
ity is so well known to local fans that
they always expect and see classy
work when he is performing.
Peterson and Hummel made up the
visiting battery, and both did well. The
locals found Peterson for six ripe bin
gles, however, and three of these were
hunched in the eighth inning, giving
Princeton a couple of needed runs.
Braham was tne first side at bat,
and succeeded in pushing a run over
after two men were down. Princeton
started an offensive movement also in
the initial round, and two of the locals
traveled the paths for the complete
circuit. Wilkes was first up, and he
proceeded to lean on one for a sizzling
single. He finally reached second, and
went to third on a balk. Smith came
next, and he hammered a hot one that
the pitcher failed to handle, and Wilkes
scored. Jesmer was retired, but while
the visitors were eliminating him as a
scoring factor, Smith reached third.
Berg also went down, but Caley went
to first on a dead ball. Mallette then
came to bat, and the question of an
other run was squarely put up to the
captain. He met it by straightening out
one of Peterson's slants for a scream
ing single, and Smith romped home.
The side took the field when Skahen
was retired. In the second round
Braham evened up the score. An er
ror placed the first man up on the
initial sack, and a hit carried him to
third. A sacrifice fly gathered in by
Roos enabled him to count. From
then until the eighth stanza, both
teams battled gamely, but neither side
could count. Wilkes pitched sensa*.
tional ball during this period and in
only ne inning did more than three
men gaze at him from the batter's
box. In the seventh two questionable
decisions killed an almost certain score
for Princeton. Doane was called out
at third on a play that wasn't even
close, and Wilkes was waved out at
first a minute later. The fans, "Pongo"
Olson, and the players were then deter^
mined to do something, and the game
was put on ice the next inning. Three
luscious bingles did it. Smith started
thing by lacing out a hot single, and
Jesmer followed suit. Berg rapped out
a fielder's choice, and everybody was
safe. Caley hammered out a drive to
right field that was gathered in, but
Smith counted on it. Captain Mallette
then "kicked m'* with his 'second timely
swat of the game, and Jesmer crossed
the registering station. The side was re
tired before further scoring was done.
Braham made a last desperate stand
in the ninth, and managed to push one
run over. This was not enough to
win, however, and when the side was
retired Princeton had the game.
NOTES.
H. J. Plaas represented Princeton as
umpire, and his decisions were abso
lutely fair and impartial as usual. At
torney Kennedy of Braham was the
other umpire and he did well also.
Caley was again on first base, and
his return has strengthened the inner
works to a considerable extent. He
performed excellently, as usual.
Braham has a fast team, and the
contest was a rattling good one.
The mobilization of the militia has
demoralized the ball team, and it will
probably be several days before it is
known whether Princeton will have a
team or not. Several of the star per
formers are affiliated with Co. G.
A New League.
One hundred independent Minnesota
base ball teams have signified their
intention of joining the Minnesota
State Fair Baseball League, which is
being organized to determine the base-
ball championship of the state. At
least fifty more teams are expected to
enter the race before the entries close
July 1.
Baseball teams of the state will be
divided into three classes: Those from
towns of 1,500 those from towns be
tween 1,500 and 5,000 and thosefrom
cities of more than 5,000. The Twin
Cities are excluded from taking part
in the race. Cash prizes of $450 will
be offered the winners of the three
divisions, and a handsome silver lov
ing cup will be given the team which
wins the championship in each divi
sion.
A complete report will be kept of
every game played by each team in
the league between June 20 and Aug
ust 25, and 'all teams eligible to the
leadership in each division will be
permitted to play at the Minnesota
State Fair for the cash premiums and
the silver cups. Much interest in the
contest has already been aroused, and
a great race is expected. The Prince
ton ball team will be in the race if
the organization is maintained here.
Children's Day at the Congregational.
Services especially fitting for young
people will be conducted at the Con
gregational church next Sunday, and
all are invited to attend. The morn
ing exercises will start aat 10:30 o'-

Cambridge Fire.
Cambridge was visited by a disas
trous fire yesterday morning, when the
First National bank building and a
large structure occupied by the Berg
lund Furniture Co., and the Johnson
Hardware Co., were completely wiped
out.
The fire started in the Berglund
store at about six o'clock and the
origin is unknown.
The village water works plant was
"out of commission" at the time and
this made the situation extremely crit
ical. For a time it was feared that tha
entire block was doomed, and all the
merchants occupying buildings on the
chief business street of Cambridge
had their goods carried out into the
street. Fortunately the wind was in
the right direction, otherwise the dam
age would have been much greater.
An appeal for aid was made to
Isanti and it promptly responded with
its limited fire fighting apparatus.
A special train on the Great
Northern brought a fire company and
engines from Minneapolis which ren
dered good service.
The bank and store buildings were
handsome and substantial structures.
The Tri-State telephone office was lo
cated in the bank building and a den
tist also maintained offices there. Until
recently the Independent-Press was
also housed in a room on the second
floor of the bank building, and offices
were being fitted up for professional
men in those quarters. The loss is a
heavy one, but partially covered by
insurance.
Princeton sympathizes with its sis
ter village in the disaster that has be
fallen it. But new business edifices
will promptly be erected to replace
those wiped out yesterday morning.
MILITIA CALLED OUT

Guardsmen to Mobilzie for U. S.

the Guard Will Mobilize.
Word to the effect that President
Wilson had called-the National Guards
of the various states into service of
the United States reached Princeton
Sunday evening, and the news created
considerable excitement.
The Mexican situation is responsi
ble for the call. The de facto govern
ment of Mexico has threatened to at
tack American troops now in Mexico
unless same are withdrawn, and the
United States has bluntly informed
Carranza, the provisional president,
that this government cannot recede
froni its settled determination to main
tain its national rights and to prevent
further raids across the boundary.
War is not inevitable, but the situa
tion is critical.
Official information of the call to
service arrived here Monday morning,
when Captain A. H. Johnson of Co.
M. N. G., received the following tele
gram:
St. Paul, Minn., June 18.
Capt. A. H. Johnson,
Princeton, Minnesota.
The President of the United States
having called the organized militia
and national guard of Minnesota into
the service of the United States, I am
directed by the governor to order your
organization to prepare for mobiliza
tion and muster into U. S. service. Re
cruit to 65 enlisted at once. Notify this
office when you have done so and
await further instructions. The ut
most care should be exercised by re
cruiting officers as to physical condi
tion of recruits. WOOD,
The Adjutant General.
Captain Johnson, Lieutenant Morton
and the other officers of the local com
pany immediately busied themselves
in preparation work, upon receipt of
the telegram. Enlistment blanks were
ordered printed, and posters urging
young men of this vicinity to volun
teer for service were turned out at
the Union Printery.
Seventeen recruits have been en
listed since Monday, and others are
expected to join before the local com
pany of guardsmen leave for Fort
Snelling to mobilize. At this time
there are 62 members of the company
out in uniform in Princeton, and four
other members are expected to arrive
here today. This total includes 15
married men, but they will undoubt
edly be discharged if enough recruits
can be secured.
Captain Johnson has had the local
company out for drill twice a day
since Monday. Today the range will
be visited, and rifle practice will be en
gaged in.
The indications are that Co. will
leave for Ft. Snelling in a day or two.
Captain Johnson has received the
following instructions as regards
the Armory, from Adjutant General
Wood.
Commanding officers of troops sta
tioned in armories will designate re
sponsible persons (preferably retired
officers) as custodians of the armories
and the property therein contained
upon a form furnished for that pur
pose of all of the property so to be
left behind, certifying to such inven
tories in triplicate. The property so
inventoried should be receipted for by
the custodian in triplicate, one copy of
the inventory to be retained by the
commanding officer, one copy retained
by the custodian and one copy forward
ed direct to the Adjutant General of
the State.

NOTES.
Since the above was written Gustave
F. Pape has enlisted.
Princeton will be a mighty lonesome
place for some, after the departure of
the militia.
The local company has some husky
members, and they present a fine ap
pearance while drilling.
This morning the members of the
company were put through a series
of physical culture exercises.
Princeton citizens should endeavor
to make everything as pleasant as
possible for the boys while they are
still with us.
Recruits will be enlisted up to the
time of departure. Any young men
desirous of accompanying the boys
should report at the Armory at once.
Capt. A. H. Johnson has been ex
tremely busy since Monday, and the
company is now ready to depart. He
wired Adjutant General Wood to that
effect this morning.
Children's Day at the M. E. Church.
Children's day will be appropriately
observed at the M. E. church next
Sunday morning, and a pleasing pro
gram has been prepared for the occa
sion. The program appears here

Main Street to be Paved.
Two blocks of what is commonly
termed Main streetfrom the corner
at the Farmers' Co-operative 'store to
the corner at E. Nelson's storeis to
be paved with concrete. This was
definitely decided at a special meeting
of the village council last evening. All
members of the council were present
and Mayor Newbert presided.
A number of Princeton's business
men attended the meeting, and Mr. T.
H. Caley strongly urged that the coun
cil put in concrete paving.
An estimate of the cost of the pav-,
ing was submitted by the Bergman
Warner Co., placing the total at $5,-
916.16. This includes the cost of cov
ering the concrete with two inches of
sand, and the shipping in of sand from
Zimmerman. The street will be paved
from gutter to gutter.
Preliminary arrangements were also
made to extend the sewer along "E"
street before the concrete is put in.
No other business was acted upon,
and the council adjourned after dis
posing of these matters.
Bragdon Convicted.
Bragdon, the lecherous rich Minne
apolis scoundrel who made a business
of debauching girls of tender years,
was found guilty, but the jury recom
mended that leniency be shown him.
The severest penalty that the law will
permit should be imposed.

In the Fourth district there was no

trict Jepson is the republican nomi

is just as good a republican as Mr.
Jepson, will again oppose each other
in November."
On the democratic ticket Dan Law
ler is the nominee for United States
senator, and Dwyer, the Minneapolis
boiler-maker, is probably nominated
for governor.
The Result in Mille Lacs.
Monday was a beautiful day, the
farmers of Mille Lacs county were
busy and the majority of them felt as
if they could not afford the time to go
to the polls. But the same apathy was
manifested in the villages, and less
than 50 per cent of the voters exer
cised the right of suffrage. There be
ing no" contests over the local offices
also contributed to the lightness of the
vote.
Appeals to racial and religious pre
judices were generally unheeded in
this county. Borgholm town for inr
stance, which is the strongest Scan
dinavian precinct in Mille Lacs county,
gave Frank B. Kellogg three times as
many votes as it gave Eberhart o*
Lindbergh the vote in that town was
as follows: Clapp 3, Eberhart 29,
Lindbergh 28, Kellogg 87. The same
is true of other strong Scandinavian
precincts of the county.
The village of Foreston was the ban
ner Kellogg precinct in proportion to
population. The vote there was: Clapj
2, Eberhart 2, Lindbergh 2, Kellogg
41. Wahkon also gave Kellogg a hand
some indorsement27 to 1 for Eber
hart, 4 for Clapp and 3 for Lindbergh.
Princeton village gave Kellogg 140,
Eberhart 32, Clapp 4, and Lindbergh
13. Milaca village gave Lindbergh
27, Kellogg 20, Eberhart 12, and
Clapp 5. The total vote of the county
for United States senator, exclusive
of the village of Isle, which has not
yet reported, is as follows: Kellogg
568, Lindbergh 176, Eberhart 161,
Clapp 43. Kellogg's plurality over
Eberhart in the county will be about
415.
Burnquist for governor and Rines
for state treasurer also ran well in
this county.
For lieutenant governor James A.
Peterson and Thomas Frankson ran
neck-and-neck. Princeton village gave
Peterson 88 and Frankson 66.
Very few voted the stub-tailed dem
ocratic and prohibition ballots.
A tabulated statement by precincts
will appear in next week's issue of
the Union. Here are the totals exclu
sive of the village of Isle:

Schield-Hedeen.
A pretty marriage was solemnized
at the home of the bride's parents, Mr.
and Mrs. John Hedeen, in Borgholm,
last Thursday afternoon at 4 o'clock,
when Mr. Raleigh Schield and Miss
Martha Hedeen were united in wed
lock. The ceremony was performed
in the living room before an impro
vised altar of apple blossoms, flanked
on both sides with ferns and flowers,
.Rev. U. G. Lacy, of Rice Lake, Wis
consin, read the service, and Miss
Bessie Hedeen played the wedding
march.
Miss Florence Hedeen and Alice
Westling, sister and cousin of the
bride, respectively, were bridesmaids.
The bride was attired in a gown of
white taffeta with a tunic of white
net, cut deep in points, edged with
taffeta. Her veil was fastened with a
band of rose leaves, and she carried a
bouquet of brides roses. Miss Flor
ence Hedeen wore a white voile gown,
and Miss Alice Westling was attired
in a gown of green voile. Both had
corsage bouquets of white roses.
The bride entered the living room
with her father who gave her in mar
riage. She was met at the altar by
the bridegroom and his attendants,
Messrs. Emmet Schield and Louis
Westling. The former is a brother
of the grocm and the latter is a cousin
of the bride.
At the conclusion of the ceremony
Mr. and Mrs. Schield were showered
with good wishes and then a reception
was held for the relatives and intimate
friends in attendance.
The happy young couple left at once
on a honeymoon trip through the east,
and upon their return will make their
home in Dalbo, where the groom oper
ates a farm.
Mr. and Mrs. Schield enjoy the
respect and esteem of all who know
them, and a large circle of friends
extend the choicest of felicitations to
them for a long and happy wedded
life.
Among those from away who at
tended the ceremony were the fol
lowing:
Mr. and Mrs. Jerd Luman, Litch
field Misses Alvina and Florence Bro
lin, and Emil and Ralph Brolin, Beck
err Mr. and Mrs. Bishop and family,
Princeton Mr. and Mrs. Peter West
ling, Mr. and Mrs. James Westling
and family, Mr. and Mrs. Giles Ells
worth, Miss Ella Westling.
Princeton town cast only 84 votes
at the primaries Monday. The elec
tion was held in the new warehouse
at the rear of the Farmers' Co-opera
tive store. Supervisor Henry Marpe,
Fred Eggert and Henry Kunkle
were the judges, and Town Clerk Al
bert Kuhfield and Aug. F. Meyers act
ed as clerks. Each one attended to his
duties in a commendable manner, and
the business was wound up at 12 o'-
clock.
