Car-t. J. B. Hannon Will Enlist
Men
for First Regiment.
Capt. J. B. Hannon this morning re
ceived instructions from Adjutent Gen
eral Lee S. Tillotson to open a recruit
ing station in Bennington to enlist men
for the first regiment of the Vermont
National Guard now mobilized at Fort
Ethan Allen in expectation of war with
Mexico.
Men are wanted for the ranks, for
the regimental band and for mounted
orderlies.

to secure quarters for the recruiting
station but expects to have this de
tail settled before tomorrow.

men living in Bennington who have
served In the national guard as mem
bers of company K. At the time of
the landing of the marines at Vera
t'ruz and following the occupation of
that city by American forces, Capt.
Hannon opened a station here for the
purpose of securing a provisional list
of recruits and found little difficulty
in obtaining the required number of
named.

"Miss Gertrude Miller presided at
the piano, and preceding the ceremony
played "A Perfect Day', and as the
wedding party approached the tastily
decorated northwest room, the familiar
strains of Lohengrin's Bridal chorus
were heard. The ceremony over, Men
delssohn's wedding march was played.
"The bride was prettily gowned In
white Georgette crepe with white taf
feta trimmings, wore a veil caught
with orange blossoms and carried., a
shower bouquet of roses and lilies of

WANTS PAY FROM STATE
Col. Estey Wants Guard Treated
as
They Were in 1898
Col. J. Gray Estey, former com
mander of the Vermont national guard,
sent to Gov. Charles W. Gates Tues
day afternoon a message urging him
to take the necessary action to provide
extra or state pay for Vermont troops
responding-to the president's call.
Action of a similar nature was taken
by the state of Vermont when the
militia was called into the federal ser
vice In 1898, and Col. Estey believes
that there is as much necessity for it
now as there was then. !f Gov. Gates
adopts the suggestion it will be neces
sary for him to call a special session of
the Legislature as Gov. Grout did at
the time of the Spanish-American war,
when the state voted $1 a month for
each man in addition to the federal
pay.
DIOCESAN CONVENTION
Canon Amended to Permit Women to
Vote at Parish Meetings
Montpelier, June 21 The 120th an
nual convention of the Episcopal dio
cese of Vermont, with 27 clergy and
about 50 lay delegates present, opened
this morning at nine o'clock, with the
Rt. Rev. A. C. A. Hall, D. D presiding.
The convention reelected the Rev.
Walter C. Bernard of Newport secre
tary and the Rev. G. B. Brush of Shel
burne was appointed assistant secre
tary The business session of the conven
tion, which commenced at noon, the
delegates stopping for lunch, extended
throughout the remainder of the day,
being preceded by the opening service
in the church, tho celebration of the
Holy Communion. The charge was de
livered by Bishop Hall.
He spoke on "Liberty and Loyalty,"
twin watchwords of the Catholic posi
tion and in opening remarked that he
had not delivered a charge since 1910
because of illness and consequent dls
ability.
"Let lt be clearly understood that
the Catholic creed, and not the 39 ar
tides or religion, are our primary
stand of belief," he said. "We are
bound to teach authoritatively the
faith; we may offer our own opinions
in explanation and illustration of the
faith. We must not explain away the
facts or truths which we profess to be
lieve. Playing tricks with plain words
can never be a commendable exercise
It may easily lead to disastrous moral
consequences. Let ub face questions
honesty.
Upon the marriage law he said that
so far as the church s sanction and
recognition of a mnriage is concerned
Is pre-eminently a matter of eccleslasti
cal discipline where the individual
clergyman Is bound to observe and en
force the church's rules, whatever his
personnl opinion concerning this or
that point may be. "I am greatly in
hope that our canon on this subject
may be made more clear and unnilstak
able In Its requirements and more
strictly in accordance with tho teach
Ing of holy Scripture." . ,
Four of the eight deputies to the nn
tlonal convention to be held at St.
Louis in October were elected tonight.
tho cletgymen chosen being tho Rev
W. C. Bernard of Newport and the
Rev. A. C. Wilson of Bellows Falls; lay
delegates, S. V. Hindes, Burlington
and Marvelle C. Webber, Rutland.
The convention after much discus
slon voted to amend tho canon to per
mlt women to vote In parish meetings
and to bo eligible for parish offices.
The report road by Bishop Coadjutor
Geoige Y. Bliss for tho special commit
tee on the general pension fund for re
tired clergymen was adopted, the Ver
mont diocese by Its action concurring
In the proposition to change the pen
slon fund from local to national con
trol. All but one state has agreed on
vim
the plan.

Five Troops of Colored Cavalrymen
Ambushed by
Seventeen Americans Made
Are Probably Wounded Loss of the Mexicans Es
timated at 200 Fight Lasted Two Hours Troop
ers Retired in Good Order in the Face of Over
whelming Numbers Mexicans Place Blame for
Clash Upon Americans
El Paso, June 22. The story of the
battle between the Mexicans of Car
ranza's army and the American troops
of the 10th regiment is gradually com
ing through, but so far entirely from
Mexican sources.
It appears that upwards of 4000
Mexicans under Gen Gomez at Carrizal
ambushed 500 Americans and killed 40
of the U. S. troopers and captured 17.
The colored soldiers or the 10th though
outnumbered 10 to one fought the
Mexicans savagely and charged them
repeatedly finally retiring before
weight of numbers.
The Mexican loss Is thought to be
about 200 and includes Gen. Gomez
who was killed. The number of
Americans wounded ia not large but of
the 17 captured several were probably
wounded.
Five troops of the 10th were scout
ing in the vicinity of Carrizal and were
attracted to the village by the Mexi
cans waving a Hag of truce. It ap
peared later that the Mexicans had
concealed their Foldiers and machine
guns and when the Americans ap
proached the Mexicans opened fire.
The fighting lasted nearly two Hours
belore the Americans retired. The
Mexicans in spite of superior numbers
were too demoralized to. follow.
Oen. -Pershing has-seut -reinforce
ments to the troops attacked and an
other battle is likely to occur near the
same scene.
Washington, June 22. The national
guard will be pushed forward to the
border as fast as it is equipped and
ready and the states which are ready
first will have the preference.
EI Paso. Tex., June 22. American
and Carranza troops fought a bloody
battle yesterday only a few hours after
President Wilsons 0000-word rebuke
Tuesday to Gen. Carranza had gone
forward to Mexico City. WHIi which
side victory rested is not known here
The engagement took place on the
Santo Domingo ranch near the Mexi
can town of Carrizal, which is nine
miles southwest of Villa Ahumada, the
the Mexican Held headquarters in
northern Chihuahua. The number of
dead, American or Mexican, was not
definitely known last night, but near
ly a score of Gen. Pershing's men are
said to have been killed and the Mexi
cans are said to have lost more than
two-score. Seventeen Americans are
declared by Mexican officials to have
been captured and two have been hur
ried to Chihuahua City under adequate
guard. A machine gun used by the
Mexicans is reported to have done
heavy execution. The Americans en
gaged are thought to have been mem
hers of a troop from the 10th cavalry
a Negro regiment, returning from i
scouting trio to Guzman. The size of
the Mexican force, whose commander,
Gen Felix Gomer. was killed, is not
known.
News of the battle was received in
Juarez earlv yesterday alttmoon by
Gen. Francisco Gonzales, Carranz
commander of the military zone of the
border. For sosic reason Gen Gon
zales kept the story secret until late
in the afternoon, when an American
C. Huffrel. returning to the border
from the interior, brought to El Paso
the news that he had seen numbers of
Mexicans dead along the Mexican Cen
tral railroad tracks at Villa Ahumada
and had been told that there had been
an encounter.
Gen. Gonzales's first step after con
firming the news was to issue a state
ment placing tho blame on the Amer
ican commander, he charged that the
American troops fired first on the
Mexicans, and that their shots were
directed at a courier who had just pre
sented to them a request that they re
tire. American army officers declared
absolute disbelief last night In Gen.
Gonzales's assertions. The opinion
was expressed that If the Amei leans
(lied on the Mexicans they did so be
cause It was necessary in order to In
sure their own safety.
Early last night the only official de
tails of the engagement received here
came from the Mexican side of the
river. General Gonzales said that his
information was transmitted to him
from Villa Ahumada by Colonel Geno
veso Rivers, who commanded the
Mexicans nftcr their leader. General
Gomez, was Blain. General Gonzales
bIko gave the Mexican explanation of
how the two forces came In contact.

TROOPERS KILLED

4,000 Mexicans
Prisoners, Some of Whom
ment, the Mexicans had the advantage)
for they had provided themselves with
a machine gun and this is supposed
to have done deadly execution in tho
anks of the Americans. That the lat
ter was not inefficient, however, was
proved by tho number of Mexican dead
and wounded removed to Villa Ahum
ada and witnessed by Americana com
ing north on a train bound for Juarez.
The battle began about 10.30 a. m.
and lasted not more than an hour. It
apparently ended with both sides with
drawing. The failure of General Per
shing to report on it, indicated that the
American survivors had not yet re
turned to their base at -n early hour
tonight.
A story brought to El Paso by JVC.
Hubble, an American, who has been
employed by the Compania Agricola at
Boquillas, bears out several of the de
tails of the engagement presented by
General Gomez. Hubble's story was
corroborated by James Maxey, another
American, who also was on his way to
El Paso from the interior. Hubble
and Maxey said that while their train
was stopping at Villa Ahumada, they
noticed numbers of dead and wounded
being brought in and were told by a
Carranza captain that a battle had tak
en place. The captain informed them,
they said, that several Americans, prls
oners, had been locked in a cattle car
and were to bo taken to Chihuahua
City to be hanged.
They mentioned Mexican soldiers
who told them that several hundred
Americans and 120 Mexicans had been
engaged.
The Mexican officers at Villa Ahu
mada treuted us with the ; greatest
courtesy," said Mr. Hutjble. "They
answered our questions quietly and
witli no show of antipathy or excite
ment.
"According to the story they told us
the Mexican command was concealed
in the underbrush when it discovered
the American cavalrymen riding tow
ard them over the sand. General Felix
Gomez, Mexican commander immedi
ately sent a courier nsklng for a par
ley under a flag of truce With the Amerl
can commander. The parley was ar
ranged and as the Mexlcaa's leader
and two aids statted forward, the
Americans suddenly deployed in a
semi circular skirmish line.
"General Gomez, apparently believ
ing he was about to be attacked,
raised his arm and signalled a machine
gun In the rear to open fire on tho
Americans. The machine sun swept
the cavalry ranks, causing heavy
losses."
"Immediately, however, a detach
ment of American troopers dashed for
ward under heavy fire, to the center of
the field where General Gomez and his
staff were sitting on their horses. In
the resultant encounter, one of the
cavalrymen killed the Mexican leader
with his pistol, while the remainder of
the Carranza party escaped to their
own lines."
. The two Americans said their infor
mation was that the American dead
numbered seventeen and that tho
Mexicans had taken forty prisoners.
Washington, June 22. Somo Intima
tion as to what Gen. Carranza's step
will be was expected hourly last night
at the state department. Official ad
vices reported that the American re
jection of the demand for recall of
Gen. Pershing's troops from Mexico
was under consideration yesterday by
the first chief and his cabinet.
Special Agent Rodgers, who made
the report, was unable to forecast the
action of the defactor government, and
threw little light on what was going
on in the Mexico capital. From other
sources, however, it was learned that
European diplomats are exerting pres
sure on Carranza to prevent him from
going to war with tho United States.
The entente allies are particularly
anxious. It is understood, that nothing
should occur at this time to shut off
tho oil supplies for tho French and
British navies from the Tamplco fields.
Allied diplomatic representatives in
Mexico believe, too, that German In
fluences have been working on Car
ranza In nn effort to create a situation
that might embarrass the enemies of
the central powers. They have assert
ed that German agencies have been
active in stirring up feeling against
the I'nited States, not only In Mexico,
but throughout South and Central
America, to prevent llilx country from
securing trade formerly controled by
German merchants.
