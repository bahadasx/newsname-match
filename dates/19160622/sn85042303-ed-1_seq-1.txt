TO ENFORCE CARRANZA'S ORDERS, WILSON WILL
ACCEPT IT AS ACT OF WAR.
If Battle is in Answer to the Note Sent to Carranza, There is
Little Doubt in Washington that President Will Recom
mend to Congress a Declaration of War Stir of Grim
Purpose Noticeable Today about the State and War De
partments Baker Held Conference with Wilson on Basis
of Report Given Out by Mexican Commanders at Border
Announced from White House that Wilson's Policy is
Unchanged for Present ut Least and that He Has No Inten
tion of Going Before Congress Immediately. Hay Re

Regular Army.
nncupy PART
OF MEXICO IF
U. S. ARMY WOULD TAKE STRAT
EGIC POINTS . BELOW BORDER
TO PROTECT COUNTRY FROM
INVASION.
Washington, Juno 21. There was
much speculation on all sides tonight
as to the probable course of the presi
dent should Curranza order an attack
on Pershing's men in the face of the
American government's solemn warn
ing. H was generally believed that the
hint in Secretary Lansing's note that
military occupation of northern Mexico
had been considered ns an alterna
tive at a time when the situation be
yond the hiordor appeared critical,
might indicate the plan of action
should war now be forced upon the
nation.
As a preliminary step to such oc
cupation and pending the organiza
tion of an army such an undertaking
would require, it was regarded as pos
sible that a general advance from the
border line paralleling the head of
General Pershing's column at Naml
that the American survivors have not
American forces disposed along such
a line holding important towns and
strategic points from the Pacific to the
Gulf coast there could be no fear of
serious hostilities at the border. An
advance of the Mexican force would be
subject to attack from the rear.
There Is no fear here for the safety
of Pershing and his men. The exact
number beyond the border constitute
military secrets. There is reason,
however, to believe that between 10,
000 and 12,000 regulars are posted at
the advanced camp or along the line
of communication.
One column with strong artillery
support is said to be ready to cover
Pulpito pass, the military highway
through the mountains between Chi
huahua and Sonora, and through
which the formidable Sonora garri
sons might seek to strike at Persh
ing's rear detachments.
It was pointed out that establish
ing a line across Mexico south of Pul
pito pass would close that route to
hostile forces. Another argument in
favor of this plan of action was that
the various railroads could be quick
ly repaired and used to supply the
troops, making it possible to shift
the entire Bcene of hostilities onto
Mexican soil. Some officials believe
that with the prompt repulse of any
attack on the American forces and the
maintenance of a rigid watch over
the supplies that enter the country
complete occupation could be carried
out with little fighting after the lapse
of a few weeks. While roving bands
of outlaws would make vigilance es
sential it was thought organized re
sistance could be quickly broken up
as the advanced columns were re
.'nforced with volunteers and moved
slowly southward.
Army officials would not discuss
those suggestions. They admitted
privately their belief that war was
imminent, since Carranza has given
every indication of a determinaton to
force an issue at any cost, but were
disposed to refrain from making any
arguments that might further inflame
the minds of the Mexican people.

Washington, D. C, June 22.
General Pershing's interpre
tation of yesterday's fight with
the Carranza troops near Carri
zal will probably determine
largely whether the incident
will cause immediate war.
If it develops that the Amer
icans were attacked to enforce
Carranza's orders, Wilson will
probably accept it as an act of
war. If the fight was in answer
to Wilson's note, there is little
doubt but that Wilson will rec
ommend to congress a declara
tion of war.
There was a stir of grim pur
pose today about the state and
war departments. Secretary
Ilaker conferred with Wilson
on the basis of reports given
out by the Mexican command
ers at the border. Lansing was
closeted with the war secre
tary, and soon after Baker has
tened to the capitol for a con
ference with the congressional
military committee chairmen.
No explanation for these con
ferences was given at the
YThite House. It was said that
President Wilson's policy is un
changed for the present at least
and that he has no intention of
going before congress immedi
ately. A resolution authorizing the
President to draft national
guardsmen, who are willing to
take the federal oath, immedi
ately into the regular army, un
der the terms of the new army
bill, was submitted today by
Secretary Baker to Chairman
Hay of the House military
commitee. Hay said he would
press the house for immediate
action.
