EDITORIAL COMMENT.
I
"Marse Henry" is enjoying all of
this excitement.
The entire Kentucky army will bo
mobilized at Earlington, instead of
Ft. Thomas.
Yucatan hastens to deny the report
that she has not as a Mexican State de
clared war against the United States.
There is not , quito time enough to
have a Fourth of July celebration in
the City of Mexico.
European powers are advising Car
ranza to back down, with some pros
pects of success.
Secretary Baker said yesterday that
State troops would have to be round
ed into shape in camps before being
sent to the border.
If the anti-American feeling in Mex
ico, is anything like the anti-Mexican
feeling in this country, both sides arc
ready for business.
The war has hit many of the print
ing offices including those of Hop
kinsville and there are several open
ings here. The Kentuckian needs
one or more printers.
Hopkinsville will send to the Mexi
can war as fine a body of young sol
diers as can be found in the United
States. Their company has been drill
ed to a high state of efficiency and the
boysthcmselves are of the eight stuff
to make the best of soldiers. Keep
your eye on Hopkinsville's warriors
when thev reach the cactus fields of
the Greasers.
LOCAL BOYS
ARE- READY
To Go To War To Teach
Mexico Another
Lesson.
Enthusiasm is running high in Hop
kinsville, which is the regimental
headquarters of the Third Regiment,
From the highest officer down to
the lowest private in Company D the
men of the Third Regiment, Kentucky
State Guard, eight hundred in num
ber, are ready and anxious to go to
the Mexican border in defence of their
country.
So far there hasn't been a single in
stance reported of any enlisted' man
making any effort to get excused from
service. 6n the other hand, there
have been a large number who have
annlied to Cant Stites, of the local
company to enlist. Capt. Stites' com
pany is already up to the requirements
and he has been unable to accommo
date the applicants.
If the order is given to increase
each company to full war strength of
about 150 men Capt; Stites says he
can secure tho requisite number in
twenty-four hours. Many of these
would be men who have belonged to
the company in tho past and therefore
aro will drilled.
By reason f the fnct that Hop
kinsville is regimental hoadquartcrs,
most of tho regimental officers live
here. Tho regimental flags and other
equipments are kept hore, etc. The
Third Regiment is also located here,
as is Company D.
Tho selection of Earlington as tho
mobilization point for tho Kentucky
troops meets with approval among
the military officers here. There is
plenty of ground available at Earling
ton, tho Third Regiment rifle range is
located there, which would provide
target practice, and it is in every way
adapted. It is easy of access, being
on the main line of tho L. & N and
has ample trackage room for accommo
dating a largo influx of trains, and it
is in prohibition territory, and the
men would not bo exposed to the
temptations thoy would bo" at Fort
Thomas.
For three days the, local boys have
been wearing their uniform and ace
practically on duty at tho armory.
Hie entire company, except a few
absent members in other States, are
rady for service on a day's notice.

Reply to Carranza Bluntly Declares His Failure to Maintain
Order, Help of Bandits and Inciting of Hostility
Toward U. S. Responsible for Conditions.
Embargo on Arms to Mexico
Will Determine Course, While Militia Mobilizes Army
and Navy Busy Preparing for Any Eventuality.
Washington, Juno 21. The issue of
war or peace with Mexico hangs in the
balance awaiting Gen. Carranza's de
cision as to the course he will pursue.
Officials here believe that forty-eight
hours might bring a clear understand-!
ing of what the immediate future has
in store.
A note signed by Secretary Lan
sing, conveyjng rrcsiaent Wilsons
rejection of The demand for withdraw
al of American soldiers from Mexico,
accompanied by a specific warning
that an attack on the troops "will lead
to the gravest consequences," was
telegraphed to Mexico City Tuesday
by Eliseo Arrcndondo, Mexican am-bassador-d
esignate.
In plain terms it accuses Gen. Car
ranza of having brought matters to the
verge of war by open hostility toward
the United States and failure to safe
guard even the lives of Americans in
Mexico or on the border from the
lawless elements among his country
men. In sternest tones the note repudiates
and resents imputations of bad faith
and interior motives brought against
the Washington government in the
Mexican communication to which it is
a reply.
CARRANZA STERNLY REPROVED
Gen. JgjTanzais-in formed in so
many words that protection of its own
borders is the only object sought by
the United States; and is told that that
object will be pursued whatever the
consequences may be.
FUNSTON MAKES KNOWN NEEDS
To carry out his share in the policy,
Gen. Funslon sent a long code dis
patch to Secretary Baker today indi
ALL GUARDSMEN
VOLUNTARILY
Washington, June 21. Tho war
department has received many in
quiries as to what immunities would
be granted married men who are '
members of the national guard. While
most officials were inclined to believe
that leaves should be granted those
who can show that their absence from
business would be a privation to de
pendent families, it was pointed out
that each caso might be presented
separately and wqtdd be decided on
its merits.
Secretary Baker announced that ho'
had asked Rep. 'Hay and Senator
Chamberlain, chairmen of the liouno
and senate military affairs commit
teos, to endeavor to bring about tho
adoption by congress of a resolution
putting into immediate effect the mili
tia draft provisions of tho now army
organization bill which will boconio
! elective July 1. The resolution prob
ably will be presented today in both
( houses.
With this information came also the
' statement that tho orders calling out
tho state troops were so framed as to
make it possible to compel tho pres
ence at tho border, at least, of every
man enrolled; They were summoned
as national guardsmep, in which status
they bear a distinct relation to tho
Federal government and by law are
tho first source for securing volunteers
who havo no connection with tho
states; thoy wero also summoned as
members of tho organized militia and
as such cannot be used beyond the
border though availablo for any duty
within the United States.
1 Tho draft provision of the new law
is applicable to every member of tho
national guard or tho Federal guard
reserve. It cannot be made retro
active, however and all national

cating what portion of the 100,000
guardsmen ordered under arms he
needs immediately to stiffen his bor
der guard. The points at which he
wishes them mobilized and the pro
portions of infantry, cavalry and artil
lery he desires to have at each place
were included.
Assignment will be made from the
first state units to be mustered into
the service. Preliminary arragements
were discussed with railroad officials
looking to their prompt transportation
to the points selected by Gen. Fun
ston. None of the guardsmen summoned
under President Wilson's call are
for marching orders. It may be a
matter of several days before the first
regiments are mustered in, as the men
will have to be examined physically,
additional camp equipment assembled
for them and the trains to carry them
to the border arranged for. '
NOTE IS FINAL WORD
The note delivered today is viewed
here as President Wilson's final word
to Gen. Carranza. It makes no over
tures for further discussion and leaves
virtually no question to be settled ex
cept one whether the defacto gov
ernment will suppress outlawry
against Americans. It arraigns Gen.,
Carranza by name forhavihg permit
ted bandits "to roam at will through
territory continguous to the United
States," while he has seen fit to recite
"groundless sentiments of hostility'
toward the expedition sent after Villa
and "to impute to this government
ulterior motives for the continued
presence of American troops on Mex
ican soil."
MUST
TAKE DUAL
OATH UNDER NEW LAW
guardsmen must, voluntarily take the
dual oath of enlistment under the Fed
eral and stato governments before
they can become subject io its opera
tion.
It is believed iiero tliat there will
be little objection on tho part of most
of the guardsmen. It is planned to
exercise the draft immediately if con
gress adopts the resolution and state
soldiers who have taken tho required
oath then will become Federal sold
iers, with no connection whatever
with the national guard or tho organ
ized militia. Thoy will bo available
for sorvice in Mexico without further
lognl formalities
On the other hand, tho who may
refuse to take the oath and will not,
thoroforc be subject to draft, will re
main under Federal control under
the portions of the old kw, which
still is oporative. They will bo avail
able for guard duty along the border,
if for nothing else, and army ofiicials
feel the urgent need of keeping them
ready for that purpose.
The resolution, it is understood,
also will authorize the president to
employ the armed forces of tho-Unit-ed
States either in Mexico or along
the border for defensive purposes.
Such a provision would meet the ob
jection of those who hold tliat a suffi
ciently clear authorization has not
been given for tho purposes of section
111 of the now army bill providing
that drafting of national guardsmen
can begin only after proper authori
zation has been given by congress for
tho employment of forces other than
the regular army. Legal officers of
tho war department desire to make
certain that no complications will ariso
later to block efficient use of tho stato
troops.

RECRUITING UNDER WAY
Gen. Williams Sends Word
to Chief of Staff That
Ky. Will Be There.
Lexington, Ky., June 19. Brig.
Gen. Roger D. Williams telegraphed
to Gen. Hugh L. Scott, Chief of Staff,
at Washington to-day that the Ken
tucky National Guard was ready for
service and that all of its companies
are well equipped. Gen. Williams
said that the present strength of the
Kentucky guard is about 2,200, but
that he did not believe that the Ken
tuck troops would be ordered from
their mobilization camp to the front
until their strength had been recruit
cd up to 4.000 or 5,000. He said that
would mean that the troops would
be in camp, becoming hardened to
camp conditions for sixty or ninety
days.
It was reported here to-day that the
Kentucky troops would not be mus
tered in for about two weeks chiefly
on account of the necessary prepara
tions for their maintenance at the
mobilization camp. The time will be
utilized in recruiting the local com
panies up to their full strength and in
completing the lists of stores and com
pleting the lists of stores and com
pany equipment.
WILL MOBILIZE
AT EARLINGTON
At Request of Kentucky Offi
cers Change is Made from
Fort Thomas.
Washington, June 19. Fort Thom
as, Ky., was touay wiped oit the map
as a mobilization point and Earlington,
Ky., was substituted as the place of
mobilization for the Kentucky nation
al guards.
This action was taken after a
"mighty holler" had come from
Tandy Ellis, adjutant general of Ken
tucky nnd other state militia officials,
who represented tliat mobilization
could be more easily and effectively
accomplished at Earlington in the
western part of the stato than at Fort
Thomas.
War department officials were not
a bit pleased with this flare up from
Kentucky, as all of the department's ,
plans had been based on the supposi-!
tion that the Kentucky troops would
he mobilized at Ft. Thomas, however,
in deference to what
annearcd to be
the sentiment of Kentucky guards
men the change from Fort Thomas
to Earlington was authorized.
