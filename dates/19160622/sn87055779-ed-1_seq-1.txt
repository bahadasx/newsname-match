Up Any Invasion.
AWAITS REPORTS UPON
BATTLE AT CARRIZAL
Believes That Conflict is But

ll.teriiati'Ui'll News STTlrp:
s'AX .iNTON'lb. Texas, June .".
Maj. Gen. Punston today U -legraidi-(1
to tho war tlepartment an earnest
iequest to send state troops to the
brder as rapitlly as possible. He is
particularly desirous that all avail
able cavalry be furnished immedi
ately in order that the regular ca
alry itgiments may be sent to rein
lorce Gen. l'ershing.
The militia of California, Missouri
and Kansas, alrealy orderel to the
border will not it.orea.-e the cavalry
forces now available to any great
extent, and Funston hope--; that the
rack raalry regiments of Illinois,
Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio
will bo on their way southward soon.
The American commander believes
that the 'arrizal conflict is only the
first of a series of . lashes ami Fort
Sam Houston buzzed with activity
today. Arms, ammunition and sup
ply's of all kinds were hurried
southward hy every train. Prepara
tions are uioler way for the influx
of miiitia. forces that will begin
within four .lays. The state forces
are to be assigned to San Antonio.
Is l' AU Night.
Funston said today that he had
everything along the border in read
iness for any eventuality, but de
clared he would take no further
steps until he had received an otll
cial American version f the Farrizal
affair. The general was up with his
s-taff nearly all night getting latest
advices from Gen. Pell at Kl Paso,
but luriiig the early fort noon re
ceived no word from Gen. Pershing.
Funston made it dear in his state
ment that no immediate steps would
be taken, did not mean that tho
10th cavalry would not be aensrel
i the Mexicans had made a treach
erous attack. Pershing has full au
thority to act; P.ell at HI Paso is
similarly situated.
"I do not intend to- interfere with
m lir'r' ldier generals except when
iieress". r." said Funston.

EL PASO, Texas, June 22. According to an unconfirmed re
port received here this afternoon Brig. Gen. J. J. Pershing with
3,000 men has arrived at a point near Villa Ahumada and has
sent an ultimatum to Gen. Jacinto Trevino, the Mexican com
mander, threatening to attack the Mexican army concentrated at
Villa Ahumada unless the troopers captured in the battle near
there yesterday are given up.
The foregoing information was contained in a dispatch re
ceived by the Cusi Mining Co. from its agent in Cusihiuirachic,
state of Chihuahua. The agent staled that he had been unable
to confirm the report, but believed it to be true.
Villa Ahumada is the Carranzista base, 80 miles south cf
Juarez. Trevino is believed to be there.
JUAREZ, Mexico, June 22. The main force of the garrison
here is evacuating the town and entraining for Villa Ahumada,
where the Carranzistas are reported preparing to make a stand
against the American troops, who are said to be moving on that
place after the Carrizal fight.
Three troop trains were loaded during the morning and three
ethers had orders to move southward at noon. From present
indications only a small force will be left in Juarez to control the
situation and they are expected to offer only a brief resistance
should the American troops cross the border from El Paso.
' WASHINGTON, June 22. Orders to report immediately the
completion of mobilization were sent to a! commanding officers
of national guard divisions by Gen. Hugh L. Scott, chief-of-stafT,
at 9 o'clock this morning. Gen. Scott said this was preliminary to
ordering all units that were ready to take the field immediately to
proceed to the border and report to Gen. Funston.
Gen. Scott said, on arriving at his office from Fort Meyer that
he expected a large proportion of the national guard would be en
route to San Antonio or any threatened point before nightfall.
