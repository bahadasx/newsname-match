Thoughtful citizens of/lie state recog
nize that the time lias come to call a
-halt upon the wild campaign hatred and
prejudice, the impregnation .of the citi
zens of North Dakota with .falsehood
and vicious economic fallacies and they
have organized the Good Government
League. It is composed of resolute men
without regard to party affiliations, who
believe in sanity and good government.
It is intended iii sl of all to meet the
flood of lies and plans of .spoliation and
exploiuuion which eminato from the So
cialise propoganda which has overrun
the stali: unchccked for the past year.
Excepting Cor the opposition of three
daily newspapers, a few bravo and inde
pendent country weeklies and the Nor
niandeii. this pjuiulerbund has run iL.-i
course unchecked. Without a dourl
more' tha half a million dollars has been
•^harvested i'rom the farmers and they are
still liable for the debts piled up by the
extravagance of these unprincipled and
uncontrolled leaders who are self ap
pointed and over whom the members of
the Non-partisan League have no check
or control.
The 'Good Government is not in any
aense an enemy of the farmers It pro
poses to help forward every movement
for the mutual advantage of farmers and
business men. believing that insuch fel
lowship and co-operation of town and
country, of farmers and business men.
lies the welfare and prosperity of the
State.
It will not be held together by appealt
to prejudice made by soapbox trained
orators, anarchists, agitators and un
frocked preachers with tainted and un
savory records, ft will go forward in a
business like manner and do its work
permanently with a view- to laying the
ghosts conjured up by the Town'ey
brand of explorers and rilling the citi
zens in the movement, of measures worth
while but which shall be fair to all ana

The new movement is not inaugurated
With a rush and yell and bandwagon dis
play. It is not a toadstool formation
springing up in the night it has no
scheme of financing- itself and drawing
high salaries for a horde of carpetbag
gers from the producers of the state.
Its beginning is modest and its mem
bership fee is small, but its personnel'is
resolute and not of the kind which lets
go in a few days. Everything indicates
that it is here to stay.
As annuo.tced solely in the Courier
News yesterday, Mr. Norman B. Black
becomes the executive onicer of the
League with offices in Fargo. His char
acter and well known record in North
Dpkot-t is answer enough to the slanders
and aspersions of the Coales-Townley
Police-Gazette, regarding the movement.
There is no financing of "Big Business"
behind it it is solely a citizens' move
ment, formed out of a consciousness
need by men who have grown weary of
the exploitation of the state and the seed
sowing prejudice and hatred, and who
propose to meet and colnteract it.
The Good Government League is time
ly and will go on its way steadily grow
ing and increasing in efficiency, and its
formation means the doom of Townlev
Ism in North Dakota.—Fargo Courier
News.
Bismarck, June 21.—There is some
misapprehension among North Dakotans
as to the nature of the honor conferred
upon Governor Hanna by ICing Haakon,
•f Norway. The honor conferred was
not in any sense knighthood, but that of
the Grand Cross of the Order of St.
Olaf, the highest order and the highest
honor within the gift, of the Norwegian
people and the King to bestow, but car
rying no title of nobility. Only twenty
seven persons now living, have it among
whom is Amundson, the explorer. This
order was not conferred upon Governor
Hanna altogether as a personal honor,
but was an appreciation of the Norwe
gian people and King Haakon for the
gift by the people of this- state to the
Norwegian people of a bust of Abraham
Lincoln.
That the acceptance of this honor was
contrary to the Constitution of the Unit
ed States is without foundation. Before
the honor was accepted the matter was
taken up with the government at Wash
ington and no objection was found to
the bestowal of this honor on an Amer
ican citizen who was the governor of a
state. Before Governor Hanna accepted
the honor he took the ipatter up with
the Federal Department of Justice, lay
ing before them the fact that he was
governor of a state, a director' in a Fed
cral Reserve Bank and in a National
Bank. The department found no objec
tion to the acceptance of the honor and
Informed Governor Hanna that it in no
wise conflicted with the Constitution of
the United States.
Counsel Bendeke, who conferred the
honor upon Governor Hanna in behalf
of the King of Norway and the Norwe
gian people, had the same assurances
from Washington before he conferred
the honor.

dressed and were in a boat, and young
Stous jumped from the boat where the
water was very deep, and as he couk:
not swim he immediately sank. One of
companions jumped in to his rescue and
wAs unable to bring him safely to shore,
and he went to his death. The drown
ing happened at the lake in front of the
military grounds and was only about j.5
feet, from shore, but the water here is
quite deep as there is a drop off near the.
shore. The alarm was at once give:v
and flhinsr and dfar-gins the lake
resorted to but up to this time they have
been unable to find the body. It is pos
sible that dynamite will be used in order
to raise the body to the surface.
Young Stous was about 22 years old
and was the son of Mrs. .Tos. Myers, and
commonly known about town, as Cro

this account. This

fective rate" for the great army of in

baielj suggests the toral money loss to
employers and employees. The lessened
efficiency, the effects of reduced earn
ings ill times of sickness, as well as
the cost of medical attention. the
economic loss form deaths, swell he cost
to industry and to the nation to almost
incalculable, figures.
That much of this loss,is nothing 1-iss
than preventable waste and that this
waste can be largely reduced by a pro
perly conducted system of governmental
helith insurance for wage workers are
conclusions set forth in Public Health
Bulletin No. 7fi. containing the results
of a study of "Health Insurance—Its re
lation to ilie Public Health." just issued
by the United States Public Health Ser
vice.
The preventive value of health is giv
en especial emphasis in this study. Any
system of health insurance for the I'nit
ed States or any Slate should at its in
ception have prevention of sickness as
one of its fundamental purposes", says
the bulletin. "This country should
profit by the experience of Kuropean
countries when* prevention is being rec
ognized as the central idea necessary to
health insurance if health insurance is
to attain its greatest success in improv
ing the health and efficiency of the in
dustrial population."
Such a system, it it pointed cut in the
bulletin, would
1. Provide cash benefits and medical
service for all wage earners in time if
sickness at much less cost than is now
possible.
2. Distributes the cost among em
ployers, employees, and the public a?
the groups responsible for disease caus
ing conditions and afford these groups
a definite financial incentive for
MUCK
remov­
ing these conditions. This can be done
by means of small weekly payment
from employees, suplemented by appro
portioiiate contributions from employers
and government at a rate reducible in
proportion to the reduction of si:knoss.
3. Become an effective health meas
ure by linking the co-operative efforts of
the three responsible groups with the
work of National, State and local health
agencies, and by utilizing these agencies
in the administration of the health in
surance system.
4. Afford a better basis for the co
operation of the medical profession with
public health agencies.
5. Eliminate the elements of pater
nalism and charity-giving by making
employees and the public, as well as the
employers, joint agents in the control of
this fund.
"A gove rnmental system of health in
surance," concludes the study, "can be
adapted to American conditions, and
when adapted will prove to be a healih
measure of extraordinary value.
A large number of people went to
Fairview, Wood Lake, Sunday to fish
and boatride, and picnic. It is estimat

John M. I'Vaine of Grafton, lieutenant
goverr.iir. candidate for the republican

tal commander, at Dickinson, last night.
Colonel Frame was advised of the"
President's act am over the long distance
t«-iep!i..u,. but. lie could make no official'
announcement regarding the state's 1110
hilir.iitirin. as he. could not get in touch
with Adjutant General John Tliaroldson.
lie declared emphatically, however,
that just as soon as orders are received
he will go to Port Lincoln and take com
mand of the forces.
1
His campaign will be left entirely in
la1 hands o" his eommittee and his man
ager. Mr. George, of Grafton.
Colonel Kraine distinguished himself
in the Spanish-American war. He joifierj
I the Aoi-f'rV Dakota national guard as a
primal in ihe Grafton company, and be
cause of efficiency and reliability, work
ed up to Major at the outset of the war
with Spain. He was in command of a.
battallion during the war. and after his
relurn to the states was made colonel
of the national guard.
Colonel Frame v.iil be in full com
mand ot the home guard, and with liim
will be many who fought with him in
1 ho Philipmes, some of whom severe.-!.!
months ago put their business affairs in
condition to be ready for action.
His campaign for governor will not be
allowed to interfere with his work at the
mobilization point, but he will spend
his entire time in preparing the troops
for service.
"When ^Colonel Frame was in lino for
the appointment as adjutant general, the.
officers of North Dakota lietitioned linn,
because of his efficiency, ability and the
high respect in which tliey held him, to
continue in active command as colonel
and allow the next line to advance.

candidal" for the Kepublienn nomination
for governor, lias just it-turned from an
extended tour of the western portion of
the state, and i.v more convinccd than
ever his candidate will be victorious at
the primary election.
Mr. George, stales that in the north
western section of the state the con
ditions are largely similar to wjliat ho
found in other sections. There is re
or less sentiment in favor of the Non
partisan league, but as a general rule
he believes that the Grafton man will
receive the highest vote of any of the
three candidates for gubernatorial hon
ors now, in the field.
"There is more or less variation, of
course, in different localities." said Mr.
George, "but 1 believe that taking the
general average it will be found that
Col. Fraine is in the lead, with Mr. Bur
dick and Mr. Frazier in a tight race for
second honors.
"This view applies not only to thj
three northwestern counties through
which I have just been making a trip
but. to the state as a whole.

Arrangements are being made for a
big' two or three day's base ball tourna
ment in this city the latter part of July.
A meeting was held the first of the

and are now busy working on the pro
position. There has been a large sum
of money raised for purses and other
expenses .aiid it it proposed to have t^e
strongest teams in this part of tho»
state here to compete for the purses.
It will be the biggest thing in the way
of a ball tournament ever pulled off in
this part of the state and will be the
means of bringing hundreds of people
here to see the games.
Peter Larson, wife and children of
Alexandria. Minn., were visitors in the
city for a couple of days the first of the
week. Mr. Larson is a brother of O. P.
