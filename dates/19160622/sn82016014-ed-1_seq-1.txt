vasion of Mexico appeared to hover
jut ahead today.
The CarrizaJ clash between Mexi
can government and American troops,
apparently resulting in the American
expedition' heaviest lo?ses to date,
pave ground for this view officially.
General Pershing's report remained
as the confirming factor. It was due
this forenoon. barring unforeseen
transmission difficulties. There appear
ed little doubt that it would aggravate
rather' than relieve the situation re
ported through Mexican sources as in
volving the lopp of forty American
live? and other casualties.
General Funston will immediately
strengthen Pershing's column, it is ex
pected, and President Wilson may
take the case before congress.
There he would ask for an appro
priation and approval of a drive into
Mexico in keeping with his threat to
Carranza to visit upon him "the grav
est consequences" if the de facto gov
ernment's forces clashed with Ameri
cans. Carranza Not for Peace.
The last thought that Carranza Is
making a serious effort to check the
inflamed passions of his people van
ished early today when General Per
shing forwarded a copy of orders fos
tered by Carranza to resist further
American crossing of the border and
to swell the Mexican army by disarm
ing those who would not join it.
This convinced the administration
that it can now hope for nothing from
the first chief and his crumbling
power.
A few high officials counseled calm
until Pershing reported, pointing out
that the information now before this
government is from Mexican sources.
Others were for wasting no time in
establishing an actual state of war.
Three States Named First.
No one professed seriously that
trouble can now be averted.
Dispatch of California, Missouri and
Kansas militia immediately to the bor
der was predicted. This, it was ex
pected, would be followed by orders
to incompletely mobilize the militia
to board fast troop trains for the
boundary.
It seemed likely that all red tape
would be cut.
Before General Funston reported
the clash last night, officials said it
ooubties woud take two or three
weeks to complete mobilization, in-
spection, vaccination, physical test
and other regulations.
"But if need arises, we can send
these forces out much faster without
gathering them at concentration
points." an official said today.
President Wilson heard the news
gravely at a midnight vigil in the
White House. He remained on duty
until border reports indicated Persh
ing could not report during the night.
Wait Nearly All Xight for News.
He left instructions, however, that
any definite information he flashed
him immediately. Secretary Baker
and members of his staff were in
touch all night with his department,
though it settled down to its accus
tomed state of calm in the early
morning hours, with only watchmen
and dispatchers on the job.

The men of Battery A stand excel

forces which will probably strike at
Mexico City from the east coast of
Mexico if war be declared. That was
the opinion of military experts here
today. Army officers refused to com
ment, but others familiar with the
situation pointed out there ia prac
tically enough artillery on the border
to co-operate with infantry invading
from the north. The battery will
leave tomorrow, it was said today.

in command of Capt. L. A. Fox.
The Iola corps arrived here shortly
after 10 o'clock, and the train carry
ing all the companies left for Fort
Riley at 11:45. Eighty-one men were
in Captain Rupert's command. One
hundred and five were with Captain
Clark. All the companies left officers
in their home towns to recruit more

the first train through here.
"Rock Chalk' Battle Cry.
The Kansas university battle cry.
that has been heard on battle fields
around the world, will be heard again
in Mexico if the troops "go in. The
university's "Rock Chalk, Jay Hawk,"
cheered the men on in the Twentieth
Kansas's bloody campaign in the
Philippines. Men carrying the stars and
stripes shouted it when they forced
the gates of Pekin in the Boxer re
bellion. It has been heard in the
European war.
A magazine writer, telling about a
charge of the French Foreign Legion
at Verdun, wrote:
Thse men of the Foreign Legion,
mostly men who are not too proud to
fight, seem to be strangers to fear.
They go into battle singing. An of
ficer told me how one regiment
charged the Germans.
"The men leaped from the trenches
and there was that hesitancy always
following the order to charge with
bayonets. A tall, unshaven fellow
leaped forward and from his lips came
the strangest sounds the French regi
ments had ever heard. It pleased
them. They passed it from mouth to
mouth and went across the field sing
ing it."

WANT MATTER LEFT TO YOTE
Ask Commissioners to Submit It
at General Election.
Ordinance As It Stands Win
Rnin Their Business.
A referendum will be demanded if
city commissioners decide to publish
the revised jitney ordinance following
a conference to be held this afternoon
between a committee representing the
commission and a delegation from the
jitney drivers union. This decision
has been definitely reached by the
drivers it was announced this morn-?
ing.
Petitions have already bene circu
lated by the jitney drivers who claim
to have obtained more than 7,000 sig
natures. These petitions will be filed
immediately after the new ordinance
is ordered published. -e
While less than ten miles of paved
streets is withheld from the jitneys
under the new ordinance, the drivers
maintain that inability to operate
over the territory would ruin their j
business. Payment of a $300 license j
fee for permisssion to operate over the j
streets would be equally disastrous!
they declare. j
At the city hall it was pointed out ;
this morning that the only purpose of
the ordinance was to protect the rail
way on the streets where pioneering
by them made development of the ter
ritory possible. All other streets are
open to jitneys under regulations now
existing.
Under the revised ordinance, jitneys
can operate under their present li
cense on Kansas avenue, on all of the
East side and all streets, excepting
those on which the West Fourth, West
Sixth. West Eighth and Tenth, the
two Washburn lines and the Country
club line street cars operate. These
ines are closed to jitneys only as far
as the streets are paved.
Ten Miles Closed.
Under these restrictions ten miles of
176 miles of streets m the city are
withheld from the jitney drivers.
members of the commission point out.
The jitneys are permitted to work out
routes over this section of the city,
however, but they must use streets not
used by the car lines.
While the revised ordinance with
holds from the jitneys the right to
pick up passengers along the lines
named in section 4, they are permit
ted to carry passengers to any part
of the city, regardless of whether or
not street cars operate on the street of
a passenger's destination. Jitneys
also will be permitted under the new
ordinance to pick up passengers on
any cross street in the city.
Permission to operate over 164 miles
of street however, will not appease
the jitney drivers, if they are to be de
nied the privilege of operating over
ten miles covered by street car lines,
without payment of increased license
fee.
Their Plan of Campaign.
"The people are not demanding this
ordinance and the jitney drivers are
not quietly going to permit its pub
lication. " Frank Brown, organizer of
the jitney union, announced today.
"If the commissioners feel that the
revision will be popular with the pub
lic why don't they wait until the next
election and submit the proposition to
a vote?
"We are going to ask the commis
sioners this afternoon to postpone ac
tion until the election. This proposi
tion will be made if the commission
ers will not permanently shelve the
revised ordinance. But if the com
mission refuses to accept any of our
proposals, we shall attempt to obtain
relief through a referendum."

"Did them nigeers run?" he would

A huckster, his. wagon loaded with
bananas, was Righted by the troops
when they arrived.
"How much da banan?" howled an

"Ten cents."
The wagon was emptied in ten min

Washington, June 22. No reason
for a change In policy toward Mexico
is seen by the Washington government
in Mexican accounts of the clash at
Carrizal yesterday between American
and Carranza troops. Until a report
comes from General Pershing there
will be no decision, but President Wil
son is said to view the fight as an In- j
cident for which subordinate com
manders probably were responsible
and not as unlikely to precipitate gen
eral hostilities.
( An official communication from the
Mexican foreign office announcing the
fight and the capture of seventeen
Americans and seeking an explanation
of the presence of United States sol
diers in that part of Mexico, far from
their base, was presented to Secretary
Lansing today by Eliseo Arredondo,
the Mexican ambassador designate. It
said an interpreter employed as a
guide by the American force declared
that the American commander was re
sponsible for the encounter.
Would Avoid Break?
From the tone as well as the con
tents of this communication officials
drew the impression that Carranza
desired to disclaim responsibility lor
the affair. From foreign diplomats at
Mexico City it was learned that car
ranza was exerting every effort to
avoid a break with the United States.
War department officials believe
that if seventeen American soldiers
actually are in the hands of the Mexi
cans they will be surrendered at the
first opportunity. A demand for their
immediate release would be one of the
first steps taken by the United States
government. Callers who saw the
president today got tne imprrasiuu
that he is determined that if despite
all efforts to prevent it, war with Mex
ico should come, the action of the
United States would be prompt and on
a scale of considerable magnitude. It
would not be a war of conquest, but
Mr. Wilson is prepared if necessary to
use the maximum available military
strength of the nation for a short, de
cisive campaign to re-establish order
and a stable government in Mexico
as well as to permanently insure pro
tection of the American border frcm
outlaw forays.
Srnd Official Note on Battle.
Washington, June 22. The com
munication " telegraphed by General
Agullar, Carranza foreign, minister,
follows:
"Please bring to the attention of
the department of state that an en
gagement occurred today (21st) at
Carrizal near Villa Ahumada, Chihua
hua, between American forces num
bering about 200 men with a force of
our government, during which t en
gagement Gen. Felix Gomez and sev
eral of our troops were killed. There
were several casualties among Amer
ican troops, seventeen taken prisoners.
"According to the statement made
by the Interpreter who was acting as
guide for the American forces, the
commander of the latter is responsible
for this encounter.
"Please make proper representa
tions to the department and say to the
secretary of state that this government
finds it difficult to understand why
tne American troops that took part In
the engagement should have been at
Carrizal, a point on the line of the
Mexican Central railroad some dis
tance from Ciudad Juarez and rather
far from the point which is alleged
to be the base of the rest of the
American troops which entered Mexico
from Columbus. Further details will
follow."
American Leader Captain Morey.
El Paso, June 22. The Americans
who engaged the Carranza soldiers in
battle at Carrizal yesterday were heav
ier losers than the Mexicans, according
to reports issued Dy the Mexican con
sulate at El Paso today. The Mexi
can claim Is that while fourteen of
their number were killed and thirty
wounded, the Americans suffered an
even dozen killed and lost seventeen
as prisoners. In addition they say the
Americana had an unknown number
of wounded which they carried off
with them.
They point also that while the Car
ranza commander. Gen. Felix Gomez,
lost his life, the American leader also
was killed.

city. The southernmost outskirts of
Juarez are not more than three ;Jid a
