tho National Guard of all States and
the District of Columbia was ordered
mustered into the Federal service last
night by President Wilson. About
100,000 men are expected to respond
to the calL They will be mobilized

Mexican border as later may he as
signed to them.
Gen. Frederick Funston, command
ing the border forces, will designate
the time and place for movements of
guardsmen to the international lino
as the occasion Bhall require.
In announcing the orders, Secretary
Baker said the State forces would be
employed only to guard the border
and that no additional troop move
ments into Mexico were contemplated
except in pursuit or raiders.
Gov. Major of Missouri is called
upon to furnish the following men
from the National Guard:
One brigade of three regiments and
two separate battalions and one sepa
rate company of infantry; one troop
of cavalry; one battalion of field ar
tillery; one company signal corps; one
field hospital; one ambulance corps,
which will mobolize at Nevada, Mo.
Secretary Baker Explains Order.
Secretary Baker issued the following
statement:
'In view of the disturbed condi
tions on the Mexican border, and in
order to assure complete protection
for all Americans, the President has
called out substantially all the State
militia and will send them to the bor
der, wherever and as fully as Gen.
Funston determines them to be need
ed for th purpose stated.
'If all are not needed an effort will
be made to relieve those on duty there
from time to time, so as to distribute
the duty.
"This call for militia is wholly un
related to Gen. Psrshlng's expedition
and contemplates no additional entry
into Mexico, except as may be neccs
sary to pursue bandita who attempt
ounitoj on American coil.
'Tho militia are teing called out k
as to !nv some troops in the scvernl
States. They will be mobilizes at
their home stations where necessary
recruiting can I dcre.'
ico was net seeking war, but would
not avoid it at the cost of national
dignity.
"Mexico" said General Carranza,
"will not declare war on the Unite!
States, but will know how to do her
duty if hostilities are forced upon
her."
In the demonstrations Monday the
American consulate was stoned. The
stoning occured while Vice-Consul
Rowe was in the building and only
ten minutes after the special repre
sentative, Mr. Rodgers, had left the
place. Mr. Rodgers Monday night
protested against stoning.

"I want Missouri's National Guard
to be the first to respond. It will be

Clark, with whom I have been already
in communication. He is now getting
out preliminary orders to regimental
commanders."
Gov. Major announced that he was

MANY ELKS TO MOBEKLY
The young ladies of the Epworth
I.eague of the Methodist Church gave
their benefit play, "Maidens All For
lorn," at the Lytic, Tuesday evening.
The play was a splendid comedy and
the large audienc waa kept laughing
moat of the time.
The plot of the play was very clev
er and the three girls In the east gave
their aunt much trouble to keep them
from meeting and flirting with Nys.
In the first act they were at Seaside
village with their aunt who was their
chaperon. The three girls who wero
cousins, were longing for the sight
of a man and a letter is written to a
friend. He tells them that there was
a doctor coming to stay at the same
house. Immediately preparations
were made to receive him and each
girl incidently had some ailment
Maude burned her arm while baking
a cake for the doctor, Bertha made
a cigar case for him and pricked her
finger, and Elizabeth, who was study
ing a medicine book in order that she
might talk fluently and intelligently
with the doctor, sprained her ankle.
Aunt Louise who was a hater of man
discovered that her false teeth were
aching. Aunt Louise and the girls
await the arrival of the doctor with
anxiety and argue who is to be treat
ed first i
The climax is the arrival of the doc
tor who is to be a woman doctor, and
the ailing aunt and cousins are heal
ed without treatment.

there is barely any part of the town

That women are better horsemen

The women took five firsts, and in
no event where a woman was enter
ed was she defeated. Miss Lula

rene Houchin of Jefferson City were
there with the most firsts, each car
rying off two trophies. Miss Long

820 EMPLOYED ON CAPITOL
Jefferson City, June 21--The force
working on the new State Capitol has
been increased to 320 men; and it is
expected that the exterior stone work
will be completed this month. Tho
contractors have not yet made a for
mal request for an extension of time.
Under the contract the building is
to be finished by July 1, 1916. This
cannot be done. It is probable the
building will not be ready for occu

not be entirely completed before the

R. Ragsdalo of Slater was in Mex
ro a short while Tuesday morning.
In his sermon Sunday night, Rev.
Hayne answered a number of ques
tions that are being discussed by the
people today on the question of pre
paredness. The charges of the igno
rant are difficult to answer because
they say that the military experts
arc in better position to know the
conditions and their judgement should
be passed upon. It is true that In the
technical matters we would do well
to listen but these are not the men
to determine the policies of state and
international relation. We American
people are far too humble in allowing
ourselves to be brow-beaten hy a
group of military and naval nabobs.
It is only by getting all classes of
people to talk on these matters that
the powers of militarism can be
broken.
Many declare that war is inevitable
and cannot be avoided. There has
always been war, and our only wise
course is to prepare for it, but is this
true? Science holds that it could bo
abolished ; Evolution teaches that
man can be changed and that the
whole creation is changing and going
up. Hsitory shows that human nature
can be changed, and third Christian
ity is the religion that teaches that
above all others that men can be
changed.
Another question presented by mili
tary advocates is in time of peace per
pare for war. This is a pagan idea and
some would keep it alive for ever. So
long as men are savages there is no
thing for them to do but prepare for
war, but today war is looked upon
with horror. Conditions are changing
that today to cry, "In times of
Peace Prepare for War", is saying a
thing, not because it is true but be
cause it has been said. Our motto
should be, "In times of peace pre
pare for longer and richer and more
stable peace."
Is preparedness the only guarantee
of peace T Preparedness creates sus
picion. Geramny has made herself a
ring of foes by preparedness and we
can do the same thing.
Many declare that the army and
navy are a police force. A police
force is to maintain order, not for
aggression or defense. An army and
navy up to a certain point are for
preserving order, but such is not the
case with dreadnaughts and large
armies and large machines.
Alarmists are continually using
that little word, if. If Japan should
Wd 200,000 soldiers on the coaBt of
California, WhatT If Germany
should land 400,000 soldiers on the
coast of New Jersey. WhatT But
are the Japs coming and why? They
might embarass ns at first but we
would embarass them later. Frank
lin D. Roosevelt, assistant secretary
of the navy in October, 1916 said,
"Strictly speaking, national differen
ces apply to preventing an army
landing on the Atlantic coast or Paci
fic coast. No navy at all is nec
essary." Military experts tell us that
no oversea nation would attempt in
invasion win less than 400,000 me.i
Look at England in the Dardanells
campaign. With England he mis
tress of the seas, it is required 31
transports and 62 ships of war 32
days to transport 33,000 unequipped
men from Canada to the field or ac
tion. Then see how 'difficult and
how much time would be required to
place 400,000 men on American soil.
It would require more than a thousand
ships and transports to place an in
vading army on American Boil within
a month's time or with a fleet and
transports as England used more than
a year would be required.

REVISE MISSOURI CHILD LAWS
The Children'a Code Commission,
appointed by Gov. Major in 1916, is
planning to submit to the next Gener
al Asembly a complete revision of the
Missouri laws relating to children.
The reports of the various sub-committees
deal with laws relating to
defective children, delinquents, child
labor, education, health and recrea
tion, and social conditions. The draft
ing of the proposed laws will largely
be done at the University of Missouri
Honorable Rhodes E. Cave of St
Louis is chairman of the commission,
and Prof. Manley O. Hudson of the
School of Law of the University of
Missouri at Columbia is secretary.
Prof. Hudson is chairman of the
committee on Piiblic Laws of the
Commission, and in making his report
he recommends that laws recognfizing
illegitimacy of children be abolished;
that illegitimate children be given the
same right of inheritance and trans
mission as are given to legitimate
children; that parents, likewise, be
permitted to inherit from illegitimate
children, and that the natural parents
be made liable for the support of the
illegitimate child. It has been fur
ther recommended that the adoption
of a child be made a court preceding,
but that no child, over 12 years old,
should be adopted without his eon
sent The other committees of the com
mission are likewise working on wise
recommendations to assist the Gener
al Assemblly in bringing about the
needed changes in our present laws
regarding children. Missouri is fol
lowing th lead of Ohio in this move
ment, which is fasf becoming gener
al throughout the country.

Why Protect Crops audi
a
When stock, grain, vegetables, fruit, etc., are
growing they are carefully watched and protected
until harvested and sold.
But the money realized from these crops, is that
always adequately protected? Or is it kept in
the home subject to theft and fire?
Open an account with this strong, reliable insti
tution and deposit all money as soon as received.
Then pay all bills by check. This is practical
protection.
