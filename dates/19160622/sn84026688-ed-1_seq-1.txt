‘MADE GOOD ON DEFENSE
Argument That Would Not Appeal tf
All Won Verdict From Jury In
the Mountain*.
Tango had penetrated the country
and every preacher in the neighbor
hood had had his fling at it. They
still preaA hell-fire and brimstone In
the mountains, and more than one de
linquent was made to shiver under the
fiery exhortation of the ministers. But
when It was noised about that "Colo
nel” Phil, a member and pillar of the
church on Goose creek, had danced the
tango at the festivities on Beaver fork,
It seemed to the good folks of the com
munity that the bottom had fallen out
of the religious world.
There were too many witnesses to
permit of a denial. It seemed almost
certain that "Colonel” Phil would bo
churched (which la local ecclesiastical
for expelled). In his distress the colo
nel hunted up the best lawyer in the
country to defend him before the
church board.
“If you had only been drunk, *
groaned the lawyer, “It would have
been easy. No one would church you
for a little drop o’ good liquor."
"I was drunk,” vouchsafed the colo
nel.
The lawyer was smiling when he
went before the church to argue the
case. It was the shortest defense on
record.
“Gentlemen,” he said, “w# concede
that my client danced the tango. Yes,
sir, we concede It, but he was so drunk
be didn’t know what he was doing.”
He won the case. —New York Satur

SALESMAN WAS BADLY STUNG
But “Prospect" Who Knew Just What
He Wanted In an Automobile
Loet Out.
“I want to buy a car,” said Felix
Spatter, according to the Louisville
Times, “and It must be a car that
combines a reflex starter, a duplex
finisher, radio-active cylinders, Heuf
fledoffer spark plug, hot air reverse—”
“My dear sir, have you bad your
lunch?” beamed the salesman. I
"Why, no, 1—” |
"Well, lunch with me, and we’ll talk
It over," said the salesman, and they
repaired to Beanery’s eatery, the moat
expensive place In town.
After the two had consumed a re
past of Philadelphia scrapple, Denver
gage pudding, San Francisco honey
comb cutlets, Springfield fritters and
Des Moines rhubarb pie, they each
drank a quart of champagne, and the
auto salesman footed a dinner bill of
|3.80.
“Now we’ll talk autos,” he said.
Felix Spatter waved bis hand.
“I won’t Insist on all these provi
sions now,” he said genially. "They're
only things I have heard people talk
about, anyway, and I don’t know the
first thing about ’em. All I'll do is In
sist on my original Intention ot not
paying more'n |4O for a car.”
Excusing himself, the auto salesman
reached under the table, and picked up
one of the empty champagne bottles
and sent It tinkling musically into a
million pieces against Felix Spatter’s
solid Ivory head.
CHIEF OBJECTS IN PRUNING
Principal Aim Should Be to Make Sub
stantial Framework to Hold
Up Loaves and Fruit.
The objects of pruning are: To
make the tree into what might be
called a substantial framework with
which It le to hold up the leaves and
fruit, to cause It to have a symmetri
cal shape, to renew the fruiting wood,
to remove crossing and diseased and
broken branches, to thin the top so
as to allow free circulation of all
through It and to keep the tree as
low as possible so as to facilitate
pruning, picking and spraying.
In young trees care should be taken
to have the main branches come out
from all sides of the tree and each
from a different height. The crotches
will all be strong then.

BEFORE THE TROUBLES COME
Why It Is Easy for Housekeeper to □
Pleasant In the Early Morn
ing Hours.
It was the first thing I noticed in
the office of the busy man- a little
square of pasteboard with this state
ment; “Be pleasant until ten o’clock
In the morning and the rest of the day
will take care of Itself.” Probably the
thing that made It strike In at my first
glance was the fact that it was after
ten, and I had come to ask a favor of
a busy man, a writer in the Indianap
olis News says. If he stayed pleasant
only till ten o’clock I wasn’t certain
of the successful outcome of my ven
ture, but when he entered the little
room I saw at a glance that his early
morning attitude toward life had not
yet worn off. He was kind, courteous,
gentlemanly, and I shall remember
him as living up to his motto.
But would It work under all condi
tions? I’d hate to say that it Isn’t
true —the statement that If you're
pleasant until ten o’clock the rest of
the day will take care of Itself- be
cause the man who said it is gone, and
can’t argue the question with me, but
I can say that maybe he hadn’t tried
It out in all trades. Take housekeep
ing, for Instance! Nearly any house
keeper can be pleasant until ten
o’clock, for It Is after that time when
things begin to happen. Who ever
heard of dinner burning before 10 a.
m ? Agents don't usually begin to
ring the doorbell until about that
time. Usually the telephone calls be
gin to come In after ten, notifying you
that you must make your number of
church calls Immediately, get some
one to help with your table at the next
church supper, be sure to attend an
important committee meeting, be at
the next club meeting without fail,
etc.
If unexpected friends or relatives
are going to drop In for dinner It will
be after ten o’clock. The postman
brings all your bad news after fen.
The afternoons bring more agents,
and callers, welcome and unwelcome.
The baby has the colic in the after*
noon, If he’s going to have it at all,
and the next sized one is cross If ha
falls to get bis nap, and the older ones
come tramping in from school with
muddy feet, noisy voices and empty
stomachs. Then the man of the house
may put In a call for a hurry-up sup
per so he can get to an important lodge
meeting on time. In fact, it seems
that all the nerve-racking, brain-fag
ging, back-breaking hours in the busi
ness of being a homemaker come after
ten o’clock In the morning.
Maybe some day we will get started
being so very, very pleasant early in
the morning that it will be like sliding
down a steep hill, Impossible for us to
stop—but some of ua will have to havq
a right smart push to get us started
When East Meets West.
An amusing illustration of the mod
esty of the Chinese in matters ot
dress Is given by Elizabeth Cooper in
her new book, “The Harim and the
Purdah.”
"When one of the Imperial prlneea
was en route to England,” she writes,
“he attended his first foreign dinner
In Shanghai. About twenty-five of the
guests were English and Amerlean
ladles, dressed In their most elaborate
gowns, which means extreme decol
lete.
“The attaches of the prince had
tried to prepare his highness for the
sight he was to witness, but they had
evidently underestimated Its startling
qualities, because when the prince ar
rived and gave one amazed look at his
hostess and the line of waiting ladlea
he was nonplused.
“He looked pitifully for his inter
preter, and not receiving aid from him,
put down his head, shut his eyes, and
bravely stumbled around the room,
groping blindly for each lady’s hand,
as he had been informed that ho
should shake hands with them.”
Meant Well, But—
Viscount French of Ypres often tells
an amusing story about a French re
view that be attepded a good many
years ago.
General French--as he then was—
attended the men’s dinner In camp one
day, and as he puffed on his cigar he
noticed that 300 young Frenchmen had
nothing to smoke whatever.
Accordingly, he sent to his tent for
three boxes of Havanas and these were
quickly distributed among the troops.
A rare treat, truly.
To show their gatitude the soldiers,
without consulting with their ser
geants, lined up iu two files, marched
toward the English general, and, rais
ing their right hands to their caps nnd
holding their lighted cigars in their
left hands, they spouted as with ono
voice:
“Vive la Russia!”
They had mistaken the uniform.—

Minces Are Ripe.
Jay was spending the day with his
grandmother. Being only three and
one-half he was not allowed the va
riety of food that the grown-ups bad.
When dessert came and he was served
with a diminutive piece of mince pie.
his Joy and surprise almost overcame
him. With an air of ingratiating In
terest and dignity, he said, “Why,
mamma, I didn't know minces were
ripe.”—Exchange.

I v 4
® Eu GEORGE COBB #
(Copyright, ISI6, by W. G. Chapman.)
There were two predominating fea
tures, dread and timidity, in the
thoughts and actions of Ralph Burton
as the leap year came in and lie was
made the target of organized menace
and raillery on the part of those who
fancied they could play upon his
weaknesses.
“You’re a selected victim, Burton'"
declared more than ono ot the little
town club of which he was -i member.
"Oil, he’ll never escape through the
month!" insisted others. “You'd bet
tor keep away from the trap ot so
cial functions."
"1 rarely favor them,” observed Bur
ton gravely,
“And have a bodyguard,” was the
further advice. "I understand that
the girls' clubs laid out a regular
program, with dates nnd victims. Not
an unmarried man iu the town will
escape.”
"Yes, and a well-fixed individual
like Burton will be the especial ob
ject of persecution I ’’
Ralph Burton smiled, but It was not
a natural smile. Nature had awarded
him a shrinking, self-deprecating ele
ment, nnd he had never battled it. At
twenty-eight he found himself a re
served young bachelor with an inborn
veneration for all womankind, yet
bashful and retiring. If lie had ever
loved, he had never been able to
summon up tho courage to confess
tho fact to the object of his adora
tion.
“A confirmed woman hater,” was
the snappy ultimatum of more than
"Er—That Is Strange.”
one of those disappointed, for in in
telligence nnd fortune Burton was a
most eligible party.
Tho “boys'’ at tho club were fond
of jokes and the arrival of the month
with 29 days in it favored their
wicked designs.
“Now, then, you want to rush the
program hot and heavy!” was the
decision of Ned W alton, a tireless mis
chief maker and therefore the plot to
give Burton a period of misery was
set in motion.
“A young lady called twice, sir.”
was tho announcement of his landlady,
two evenings later, when Burton came
home from the office.
He colored and fidgeted. Visits from
young ladies comprised a proceeding
to which Burton was an utter
stranger. He could not even recall
where recently ho had joined company
with a member of the opposite sex
so far as a single block on the public
streets,
“Er —that is strange. Leave any
name? Ah, perhaps my sister from
Smlthville.”
"Oh, no, sir—l know her," disclosed
the landlady. "She was veiled. Your
visitor was young and graceful and
acted very anxious to see you. It
struck me she was quite mysterious.
And when she left I noticed she joined
two other ladies in the street.”
"Witnesses!” gasped Burton to him
self. “If all the crowd tell about the
outlandish exercise of the leap-year
privilege by the female sex this
year is true, I tear 1 am going to be
the object of some annoyance.”
For three days Burton did not go
homo to dinner. For three evenings
he went without a light in his room
and barricaded the doors. His “veiled
lady visitor” did not appear again,
however. He began to feel relieved,
when a letter reached him.
Its pages were delicately scented
and the handwriting was exquisitely
dainty Its sentiments were burn
ing, professing “the ardent admiration
of a longing soul seeking a life ideal,”
and finding It in him. It promised
further epistles, It suggested that ho
wear a pink carnation in his coat the
next day, in order that his correspond
ent might know that her continued
attentions might not be distasteful to
him.
That especial morning Burton but
toned up his coat tightly and reached
his office by unfrequented byways.
He stayed away from the club, he had
serious thoughts of taking a vacation.
When one day a bouquet was deliv
ered. he decided that affairs had
reached the limit. He was so dis
turbed he decided to take a day off.
Burton made for the outskirts,
craving for a day's solitude In the
woods. As he passed a certain bouse
he gave one startled glance behind
him and quickened his pace. His
blushing glance hud caught sight ot
a faded lady of uncertain ago waving
her hand at him and calling his name.
He feigned not to hear. He saw her
throw a light wrap over her shoulders.
Ho saw her run out of the front door.
“Gracious!” gasped Burton, “I do be
lieve she is going to follow me. Yes,
she is, and leap year—say! she may
be tho one who sent me those flow
ers.”
In desperation Burton edged oft the
street. A row of bushes protected
him How was ho to know that Miss
Celia Dempster was simply seeking
from him a contribution to the town
relief fund for the poor?
Then as he glided through the open
doorway of a great barn and realized
where he was, Burton flushed to the
roots ot his hair. Why! he had in
vaded tho precincts of tho Morton
home, nnd Ruth Morton was a very
dear name to him, although he had
never told anyone so—no ono, not
even Ruth herself, who would have
been pleased to learn the fact.
Twice lie had been Ruth’s escort to
a town entertainment. Then he had
been too bashful to call. Often lie
hud thought of her. Now ho dodged
hack farther into the barn Ruth,
four of her little sisters and brothers
accompanying her, were making
straight for his retreat.
“Why, Mr. Burton!” exclaimed
Ruth, and she looked really pleased,
though flustered, us she came upon
him—"is this your long-looked-foi
call?”
“Er—why, yea,” declared Burton in
stumbling tones, feeling that he was
acting like a dunce. “That is, I—
well, tin taking a day oft and you
see, sort of putting iu the time —”
“Which you can do to decided ad
vantage to us," chirped the sprightly
Ruth. “Myself and this brood have
about ten bushels of apples to pare
and cut for evaporation. You shall
string. Will it please you?”
“Please me? It will bo delightful!”
declared Burton.
“Then come, sir, you must be
aproned like the rest of us!”
What a thrill pervaded his sensi
tive being as Ruth tied a big kitchen
apron around him! What a novelty
to be seated amid the gayly chatter
ing group, doing his share of the
work!
Then there was a grand lunch, then
a ramble in the orchard. Mrs. Mor
ton insisted upon his staying to tea
and then there was moonlight, and a
feverishly delicious critical moment at
tho garden gate, his own face close
closer to the charming one ot Ruth
What over possessed him? What
put new courage into his timid soul?
What irradiated his being as, after
blurting out all the story of his fears
and his hopes, he found in Ruth a truly
loyal sympathizer.
Love, love, love! —it drove him, hold
as a lion, to the club that evening.
His fellow members stared. There
was a new Burton revealed. He
bore his head high. There was a happy
smile on his face.
“Got you yet —the leap-year pi
rates?” questioned one of the group
who hud driven Burton into par
disc.
"Oh, yes," answered Burton, and
there was a cheer and joy in liis tones.
"One of the fair ladies lias. Only she
didn’t ask me. Tell it to the world
that 1 am the happiest man it holds!
I’m going to marry—”
“Miss Dempster?"
“Not on your life! but charming,
lovely, incomparable Ruth Morton!”
THE ORIGIN OF SURNAMES
Those Most Familiar Were Taken
Originally From the Occupations
of tho Holders.
Once upon a time given names
were the only names in use. One was
Tom, Dick or Harry, and that was
all there was about it. Our present'
surnames arose from tho nicknames.
Thus Tom the Taylor became In time
Tom Taylor, and his descendants
used Taylor as the family name. The
most familiar of our surnames were
taken from the occupations of our
forefathers, as Smiths, Bakers, Brew
ers, etc. Many men, moving to new
towns, had the name of the place
from which they had come fastened
upon them. Others took names like
Pope, King and Bishop, from playing
those parts in plays. Hogg and Ba
con are simple. Purcell developed
from pourcel, meaning little pig. Gait
and Grice are old dialect words of
the same meaning. Tod meant fox,
Fitchlo was polecat, and so the keen
student of language traces the begin
nings of our names in the old dialects.
Some of the nicknames were original
ly distinctly uncomplimentary, as See
ly for silly, Cameron for crooked nose
and Kennedy for ugly head. Grace
developed from gras or fat. —Ameri-
can Boy.
A Foe to Fire.
“Our childhood ambitions are sel
dom realized.”
"Too true.”
“Life with me is just the reverse of
what 1 thought It would be.”
“How so?”
“I thought I was going to set the
world on fire, and now I make my liv
ing selling insurance.” —Louisville
Courier-Journal.
Difficult Diet.
“You Americans are becoming a
race of dyspeptics,” remarked the ob
servant visitor. “You are too impa
tient.”
"Maybe that, isn’t It,” replied the
quiet citizen. “Maybe it’s all due to
the habit we have got into of swal
lowing our indignation.”
USE ANCIENT WATER CRAFT
Nations Warring in Mesopotamia
Employ the “Kelek” on the Tigris
and Euphrates.
All kinds of ships of war and of
commerce have been pressed Into
service In the great European conflict.
There are over-sea boats, on-the-water
boats and under-sea boats; there are
superdreadnaughts, battle cruisers and
disguised commerce raiders; there are
great ocean greyhounds that yester
day were floating palaces of the ocean,
carrying the wealtli and beauty of
civilization on their migrations across
the sea, but that today are grim
havens of suffering, where the wall of
pain and tho shriek of anguish have
substituted Ihe carnival of music and
the sound of mirth.
But strangest of all the kinds of
floating equipment that the war has
drafted info fervice is the kelek. De
scribing this strange boat, tire Na
tional Geographic society says;
“The kelek is probably one of the
earliest forms of water transportation
used by our ancestors in Asia. It con
sists of goatskins inflated with air,
tied beneath a framework of light
poles. Often as many as eight hun
dred such skins are used to give the
boat tho desired buoyancy.
"The cargo is loaded on to the kelek
Just as though it were a flat-bottomed
barge, after which tho craft begins its
Journey down the Tigris or the
Euphrates propelled or guided by oars.
When it reaches its journey’s end It is
broken up and sold as skins and tim
ber.
“The two great rivers of Mesopo
tamia are very crooked and very ir
regular in their depths. The air line
distance between Diarbekir and Bag
dad is 400 miles, while the water
route via the Tigris is about 1,000
miles. At many places the river is
deep enough to accommodate boats of
considerable draft, but at others it is
so shallow that a man has difficulty
in swimming. Hut even over shallows,
where a man cannot go as a swimmer,
a well-laden kelek will float without
accident.
“For thousands of years this buoy
ant boat has helped the people of
Mesopotamia to move their commerce
over the shoals and shallows of two
of the earth's moodiest rivers, and
has now come to play its small part
in the greatest war of human history.’’
Secrets of the Moving Pictures.
It takes a certain amount of time
to affect the eye. You do not see
things instantaneously. It you move
a lighted cigar in a dark room very
rapidly you see what is apparently a
continuous curve of light.
The motion pictures reproduce move
ments faithfully for the same reason.
Before the eye has a chance to see a
picture in its entirety a new picture is
flashed on the screen. The pictures
appear and vanish at the rate ot six
teen a second, in other words, so rap
idly that the effect of continuous mo
tion is produced.
Advantage is taken of this to pro
duce very curious and unnatural ef
fects; for example, an old building
tearing itself down, a hole digging it
self in the ground, a skyscraper grow
ing up from a foundation without tho
aid ot human hands. The camera op
erator has simply taken a picture of
the demolition ot tho old building and
the construction ot the skyscraper at
the rate ot perhaps one an hour, but
projects them all in twenty minutes. —

Economic Maintenance.
The split-log drag has contributed to
a large extent toward the economic
maintenance of public highways. It is

or purchased at a low price end is

Gold.
Gold is not considered a commo
dity in the ordinary sense of the term,
but is the basis on which the values
of commodities are determined. Its
value does not fluctuate, but Is uni
versally fixed at $20.66 2-3 ounce or
Its equivalent. Its price, however,
fluctuates as in the case of premiums;
Its value is stationary, hence the term
premium. The difference between
the fluctuation of that and the pur
chasing power of gold may be simply
Illustrated as follows; That while Its
value remains stationary, a pr> .aium
would serve to reduce Its purchasing
power, to be added to its cost, bat an
advance In the price of commodities
would operate to reduce the puu bas
ing price of gold, taking one dollar
as a unit. For Instance, a dollar will
purchase an article whose price co
incides, but If an advance in the com
modity raises the price of that par
ticular article to |l.lO, the purchasing
power of gold would necessarily be
reduced proportionately; or, again, in
times of adversity, Commodities are
cheap, the supply Invariably exceed
ing the demand, the purchasing power
of gold would then be greater than in
times of prosperity when the supply
does not meet the demand and higher
prices for commodities result. There
Is no difference In the cost of a penny
weight of gold today from what It waa
ten years or more ago.

an attack of pneumonia, and Molly
had come to help Carrie out —and Doc
tor Randall was the doctor. One
night she told her friend just what she
thought of her indifference to the
young doctor.
“Molly, my dear,’’ she said, ‘1 am
going to speak to you plainly. Let me
tell you it is a great thing to have the
devotion of a man who is interested
in the same things you are. Think it
over, Molly, dear.”
It was Helen Lake who spoke the
next word to Molly about Doctor Rich
ard. “You ought to be mighty thank
ful, Molly Foss,” Helen said, “to have
a man like Doctor Randall. Ho is so
exactly the right size for you.” Helen
sighed.
A week or two later Molly was call
ing on Hetty Arnold Wister, whosA
husband, Peter, had brought her much
love and a salary of sls a week.
"Molly,” said Betty, “The slightest
mischance would send us both to the
poorhouse. Doctor Randall is the most
prosperous person in Easton.”
Grace McPherson overtook Molly
a few days later. “Molly,” she said,
“you may think it is none of my busi
ness and I am awfully silly, but you
know I’ve seen quite a lot of Tom
Sears lately, and I like hips very much.
But Sundays he Just stays at home
and smokes, and when he takes me
home from evening meeting he al
ways waits outside the church door.
1 feel so wicked. Molly! Dr. Richard
Randall comes to church every Sun
day. I envy you, Molly.”
Gertrude Flske Ingraham called on
Molly on purpose to deliver her mes
sage. “1 am going to tell you frankly,”
she said, “that you don’t half appre
ciate Dr. Richard Randall’s family con
nections. I know a girl who lives in
Rye, where his family came from,
and she said his mother had just read
a paper before the women’s club on
the mistake it was for relatives to
come to live with a young couple. I
vow I never spoke of this before, but
what with Mother Ingraham and
Grandmother Ingraham and Cousin
Soplironia and Great-aunt Dorcas all
living with Percy and me and all
wanting to run the house, from pour
ing the tea to bringing up the baby.
I tell you sometimes It almost breaks
my heart.”
Molly’s dearest friend, Lou Thomp
son, who was to bo married In Juno,
came to Molly a few weeks before the
wedding. "Molly,” she said, “I know
you’ll understand why I tell you this,
for I’m doing it not to hurt John, but
for your own sake. I love John, but
he’s so forgetful of little things that
sometimes he almost breaks my heart.
He doesn’t take off his hat as soon as
he comes into the house —and things
like that, you know. I never dreamed
of speaking of this before. Until
you’ve had an experience like mine
you won’t know that manners can be
more aggravating than anything else
In the world. And you ought to know
how important they are. Molly, for
Dr. Richard Randall has the best
manners I ever saw In any man In all
my life.”
Then Molly unburdened herself.
“Dear Lou,” she said, “Richard Ran
dall is too perfect. He is interested
in the right thing, he Is the right size,
he has a good income, he’s got the
best kind of habits, and the best kind
of relatives, and he’s eugenic, and
fatherly and generous, and he has the
best disposition in the world. And,
to cap the climax, he has absolutely
flawless manners. Lon, lam not per
fect myself, and I’m not going to mar
ry a man who is. If I ever did a
thing that wasn’t quite right, or ac
cepted, you know, Richard would
never say a word, but I would feel
his reproach to the end of my days.
If I could only find one single little
human failing In him I would marry
him, but I won’t marry a perfect man,
and if I were you, Lou Thompson,
I’d be mighty thankful that John does
sometimes forget to take off his hat.”
Dr. Richard Randall continued in
his devotion and Molly Foss continued
in her indifference until early last
July. On the Fourth they were in
vited to dinner several miles from
Easton. That night as they were driv
ing homo in the soft summer dark
ness, for tho seventh time Richard
Randall asked Molly Foss to marry
him, and to his infinite surprise, she
said yes without a moment’s hesita
tion.
They were married In September
and lived even more happily than
their friends had predicted. Richard
was perfectly satisfied with Molly and
Molly was perfectly satisfied with
Richard; but one day, six months
after the wedding, Richard looked at
his wife very seriously and asked,
"How was it that you said yes so
suddenly on the way home from Un
cle Rufus King’s?”
“Dearest Richard,” Molly said, kiss
ing him, “it was because you ate your
peas with a spoon.”
