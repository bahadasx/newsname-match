but were thrown back and several
men taken prisoners. The prisoners

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, June 21 —
Severe losses on both sides is the
result of a fight between United States

there appeared no reason to doubt the
report from Mexican sources that a
serious engagement hud taken place.
Instead of Hie tension being broken
by the clash, it was keyed still higher
tonight and there appeared no prob
ability that it would lie lessened until
the official report from General Persh
ing was received, or until official news
of undisputed aggression by the same
Mexican troops is received.
General Funston said ho would send
no special orders to General Bell, com
manding at El Push, or to General
Pershing until he na.l received offi
cial news.
The Mexican commander at Juarez
Gen. Francisco Gon.eiies, insisted that

THE FIGURES GIVEN BY THE WARDS
There has been a steady regislra

to indicate that by the time regis

News of t In* battle was received in

General Gonzales kept the story sec
ret until lale in the afternoon, when
an American. J. C. Huppel, returning
to Hip border from the interior,
brought to El Paso the news that he
had seen numbers of Mexican dead
along the Mexican Central railroad
tracks at Villa Amumada and had been
told that there had liepit an eneounte
with Hie "gringoos."
General Gonzales' first step after
confirming the news was to issue
-.tatement placing the blame on the
American commander. He charged
that the American troops fired first on
the Mexicans anil that their shots
were directed at a courier who hud
just presented to them a request that
they retire.
American army officers declared all
