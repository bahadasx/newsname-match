AN APPEAL TO THE MERCHANTS
Since the coming of the railroad
there has been a remarkable growth In
the city pf Beaver. The population
has increased enormously, many new
buildings have been erected of mater
ial which is entirely lircproof and
which ars now occupied by progressive
business enterprises. Considering that
mid-summer is almost upon us, busi
ness -.in llourUhiug. Everybody .is
.happy the merchants wear a ' smile
and the clerks are in good humor and
ever on the alert to attend to the wants
of their customers at all timsi, They
arc watchful for every opportunity to
promote the Interests of their employ
ers. Thnso employees are deserving of
some consideration. For this and
other reasons, which are only humane
and in keeping with tho progreiB of'
the town, wo ought to do something
for our clerks and wo claim to be one
of them In the way of Bhorter hours,
at least during the three summer
months. June, July and August. Pro
gressive towns all over the country are
closing all their stores at a stated hour
each Hveiilng. We would suggest 7X0
or 7:';o at tho latest. Oilier towns de
pending on thu same kind of trade, on
I which we depend, are closing at such
time and are Hading it conducive to
better service from their employees
without losing any of their trade. A
public announcement, giving the rco
tous for sucli a step, would ba all that
is necesary to satisfy the patrons. It
is only a matter of habit that keeps
people from ordering their groceries,
etc. und making their purchases before
supper. Once it Is. given a trial and
the people become accustomed to it
they will prefer It greatly.
Let us all get together and agree
upon a certain hour for closing and
then adheru to it rigidly. This is the
only way to make the project success
ful. Let us drop antiquated methods
and get In lluu with the more progres
sive towns and stay In line.

BEAVER'S PRIDE IS HER
ENTERPRISING BUSINESS MEN
For more than two weeks Beaver has
been an inland town again. The near
est point on the railroad to which pas
sengers could come and express and
freight be shipped has been Liberal,
Kansas. From that point It was nec
essary to haul goods In wagons arid
carry pntr-engcr by auto ae in the old
days. This condition has caused more
or less Inconvenience taevery business
house in town Shipments ordered
three or four weeks ago got as far as
the washouts would allow and have
been held up there until the road bed
and bridges could be repaired so that
the trains could run. In tho meantime
supplies of many kinds have been al
most exhaueted and in n few instances
entirely so. However, our enterpris
ing merchants have done all in their
power to suppl) their customers needs,
for which they deserve words of com
mendation. On account of tho long
haul from Liberal, oyer roads none too
good, many things have been sold en
tlr.ly without profit to the dealer and
rorlmps in some cases at a lots. It is
at such timet ns this that wu appreciate
the servicu rendered by our merchants.
They deeve a vote o' thanks for whut
they have accomplished, and surely
there aru none so ungracious as to
criticise them for the situation that
has existed.
Yon may search where you will, but
you will waste much time before you
find a bunch of merchants as enterpris
ing nB ours who will go any farther
o take care of their patrons.
SEVERE WIND STORM
This section was visited by a terrific
wind storm about 7:00 to 7 :SO o'clock
Saturday evening of last week. The
storm was followed by some rain and,
In tome parts of the county by hail.
The new postofllce building sulTered
the most extensive damage. The front
windows and casings in the second
story were blown oat and the wind,
rushed through this opening and prac
tically demolished tne entire rear wall
of the second story. Tho ground lloor
nd -itsicoutf Ms sofferedVnoJdainagB
and fortunately co one was in or
around thu bujlding at the time. The
damage is estimated at about $000 00
Part of the brick were blown oil the
fJont wall of the Davis Drug Company's
new building and two of the glasses
broken In the show windows Probably
$150 00 to f 200 00 will be required to
repair tho damage.
In the two instances above it is
thought that tho walls had not settled
and were still too "green" t'o withstand
the wind. It is due to this and not
faulty workmanship that the walls
failed to stand.
One of the plate gloss windows In the
north side of the First Nutional Bank
was broken, and the skylight damaged
in Feinberg'e store.
Numerous other small damages we're
inflicted, the greatest being to Art
Qulnn's residence. The pprch whs
blown down and the roof whb damaged
to tome extent.
Thu total damage to Beaver will
possibly amount to between S1000.OU
and $1200 00
