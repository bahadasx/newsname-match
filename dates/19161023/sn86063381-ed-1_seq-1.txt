Democratic Tariff Assailed by Burn

the Act.
INDORSES KELLOGG
FOR U. S. SENATE
Executive Defends State Expendi
tures Leans Toward Repeal of
Non-Partisan Law.
(Special to the Pioneer)
Brainerd, Minn, Oct. 23Gover-
nor J. A. A Burnquist formally open
ed his campaign for election with an
address at the auditorium here Sat
urday night before a large crowd.
He indorsed the candidacies of
Charles E. Hughes for the presidency
and Frank Kellogg for the United
States senatorship f?om Minnesota.
The governor assailed Democratic
tariffs as having "always been fail-
ures." He said that "just prior to
the beginning of the European war
^and during the second year of the
present Democratic administration
and under a Democratic tariff hun
dreds of thousands of men were out
of employment."
Supports Hughes.
In supporting Mr Hughes, he de
clared that "in order to procure jus
tice for American citizens everywhere,
regardless of section or class for Am
erica to give all nations of the world
that justice to which they are en
titled and to receive from them that
recognition, respect and honor which
the American public deserves, we
want as president of the United
States, a statesman who has shown
himself by his attitude public life
to be a fair-minded executive, a just
jtfrist, a strong *nd great personality
of independence, stability and back
bpne
No Chance for War.
Gorvernor Burnquist strongly
urged the election of Hughes, say
ing:
"His fearlessness, judgment and
fairness make him a candidate in
whom we can have absolute confi
dence, because by his record in the
past we are led to believe that he,
under all circumstances, will do what
he thinks and knows to be right
"Nothing can be more absurd than
to say if Mr. Hughes is elected presi
dent he will strive to get us into war.
In the first place, no president has the
right to declare war or to claim credit
for keeping us out of war. That mat
ter is in the hands of congress and
not with the president."
The governor said the Underwood
tariff law had proved a failure before
the European war began, but that its
baneful effects had been overcome by
the changed conditions brought on by
the war.
Tariff Disastrous.
"When the war ends," he said, "it
will be disastrous to have in exist
ence the Underwood tariff law. It will
affect adversely not only the laboring
man but the farmer, for under this
law the farmers of our section have
been injured by its enormous reduc
tion in the tariff rate on what they
produce and by the placing of many
of the most important products of the
farm, such as corn, cattle, sheep, wool
and eggs on the free list, and at the
same time by unjustly discriminating
against our Northern farmers through
protecting in the southern sections of
our country, the growers of tobacco,
rice and other products
Indorses Kello*g.
Governor Burnquist urged the elec
tion of Mr Kellogg "to procure for
Minnesota in the United States senate
that justice in tariff legislation as
well as in all legislation to which our
people are entitled
Without flatly saying so, he, by his
speech seemed to lean toward the
repeal of the non-partisan law for
the election of members of the state
legislature and a return to the dis
carded party system Along this
line, he said. "Our state legislators,
until the last election, were nomin
ated and elected as members of politi
cal parties, but the last legislature
was elected under the non-partisan
system, which now is on trial in this
state.
"It remains to be seen whether it is
better to have our legislators selected
through advancing their individual
ideas and opinions, as they are now
doing, or whether it will be better to
go back to a state government by par
ties with the propery machinery to
provi for a definite program prior
to t' session of the legislature
throi securing, by means of a party
plati rm the expression of a large
consensus of opinion."
Reviews Work.
Governor Burnquist devoted the
greater part of his address to review
ing the work of the various state de
partments and institutions. He re
ferred to the low state tax fate and
indorsed the state budget system in-
I5O* M-tei* up f&
augurated by the last legislature as
a means to holding down legislative
appropriations.
He spoke of the work of the effi
ciency and economy commission and
approved the plan for consolidating
various state departments and elimi
nating useless offices and boards. He
also advocated formation of a depart
ment of "public domain," in which
might be merged the drainage com
mission, timber board, highway com
mission, immigration commission and
others.
Previous to the meeting there was
a torchlight parade through the
streets under the auspices of the
Young Men's Republican club.

Leonard. They hunted during the
morning and early in the afternoon
the party paired off, Spencer and
Knight going to Four-Legged lake
and Smith and Soper going to an
other nearby lake.
No ducks were seen by the party
in Four-Legged lake and while walk
ing along the shore Spencer found an'
old duck boat and a paddle. Knight
warned him about going out in the
boat, but despite the warnings
iJpencer paddled out. He paddled
around for a slhort time and was re
turning to shore when he shouted to
Knight that a flock of ducks was
coming over the lake.
Knight shot at the ducksdand later

er, who with Knight, got an old
wagon box which they attempted to
use as a boat to rescue Spencer. The
wagon box sunk and Knight went
to the lake where Smith and Soper
were hunting to secure the boat they
were using. It was about one-half
mile from Four-Legged lake and
when they returned the farmer told
them that Spencer had let go of the
boat a few minutes before. He had
held onto the boat for 45 minutes and
it is believed became weakened be
cause of the ice cold water.
The body was recovered a few min
utes later
Merle D. Spencer was born July
30, 1895, at Wadena, Minn., and was
the younger son of Mr. and Mrs.
Deyro Spencer, who survive him, to
gether with an elder brother, Ray
Soencer, employed by the Great
Northern Express company, and two
sisters, Mrs. Pearl Miller of Bemidji
and Mrs. James Benfield of Corbett,
Ore The father is in Canada and his
mother is living this city. The
sympathy of the entire community is
extended to them in their hour of be
reavement.
Merle Spencer was conscientious,
broad-minded, honest, courteous and
courageous. He was loyal to his em
ployers and was in line for advance
ment
His many friends in Bemidji loved
him and many a sympathetic tear was
shed when it was learned that his
smiling countenance would be seen
no more and that God's angel had
taken his soul to realms above, where,
we believe, there is everlasting peace
and happiness He will be missed
from his accustomed place in life, but
his memory will ever linger in the
hearts of his friends and associates
and his grave will be adorned with
the tender forget-me-nots of future
years.
The funeral will be held tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30 o'clock from the
Methodist church Rev. B. D. Hans
com will officiate The Bemidji Na
val Militia, of which Mr. Spencer was
a member, will have charge of the
funeral.

KF.T.T.TTTER WANTS TO
BE A COUNTY SEAT
The Kelliher Journal this
week urges the establishment
of a new county with the
county seat at Kelliher. An
editorial in the Journal says:
"Some of our business men
are seriously agitating Kel
liher for a county seat It
has a good location, good
roads, good country and tak
ing Blackduck and Sum
mit townships on the south
and two or three ro^s of
townships from Itasca and
Koochiching counties on the
east, and a little on the north
would give us a fair sized and
reasonable county and easy of
access to all taxpayers. Now
is the time to give the project
a good boost as the legisla
ture meets this winter and
possibly the legislative can
didates would favor such a
move."
