British Front In France, via Lon
don, Oct. 23.—More than three and
one-half months of battle on the
Somme, with the heaviest concentra
tion of artillery, infantry and every
type of war material and the most
skilful, desperate fighting the world
has ever known, has resulted in a
marked -development of British fight
ing efficiency and of the means for
reducing the losses of the attackers.
In the way of concrete achieve
ments, the British have taken 80.000
prisoners or a little less than 1,50© for:
each of the twenty-one villages cap
tyred with -an average population of
about 300 souls. They have taken 125
guns, 109. trench mortars and trench
puns,.and 429 machine guns, andthey
have riot lost one gun.
The task of the British was made
especially difficult by the fact that
they were confronted at the outset
with the most powerful line of trench
fortifications, moreover every village
was a fortress, which had to be be
sieged and stormed.
The British have driven back the
Germans on a front of eleven miles
to a depth of four to eight miles.
When spring comes, peasants will
plow and seed the ground behind the
lines, which for two years have lain
fallow under a storm of shells-
In the Fricourt and Mametz vilages

World's Fibre Center
Manila, Oct. 23—Plans looking to
the raising of the Philippine islands
to the position of the fibre center of
the world are being undertaken by
the bureau of agriculture. Hemp grad
ing established last year by law, has
done wonders for the hemp industry
and now the bureau is turning its at

effort to threaten Mexico's supremacy
in these products.
Cheap stripping machines are to be
provided to encourage the production
of cleaner fibre, fibre literature is be

samples of maguey and sisal bulbils
are being sent to all the fibre produc

done to promote fibre production on a

ON LABOR ISSUE
Mr. Wilson Has Unique Rec

With Labor.
New York, Oct, 23.—The most ar

Wilson credit for being an astute poli
tician.
Any presidential candidate who can
himself hold the loyal and active sup
port of Chas. W. Eliot, president em
eritus of Harvard, and at the same
time pose as the ffiend of organized
labor find actually gain support from

membership of the railway brother

president a reformed man on this
subject and begging votes for him on
the ground that he procured the pass
age of the Adamson bill. Mr. Wilson
persuades some, at least, of the broth
erhood men that he deserves their
vote because he forced through the
Adamson bill, and at the same time
enlists the support of Judge Lovett,
president of the board of directors of
the Union Pacific, President Under
wood of the Brie, and. It is now re
ported, President Wlllard of the B. &
O..because he forced through the
Adamson bill.
There Is" nd pro'mlnent man in this
country who has. spoken so unjustly
and so scornfully of organised labor
and its aims-andaspirations as Wood
row Wilson—except his enthusiastic
supporter, 'Dr'. Eliot. It is not likely
that even. .so. adroit a politician as
Woodrow Wilson can carry water on
both shoulders continuously, and the
indications already point to the strong
probability that the labor men Will
get onto the situation before election
day.
Some of them, it is understood, are

Wilson has appointed chairman of the
