resentment of the nation.
s The law. "Chapter "02 of the
I'nited States statutes at iarpe (as
amended; providing for publicity of
contributions is applicable to all
committees, associations, or organ
izations which shall in two or more
states influence the result or at
tempt to influence the result of an
election at which representatives in
congress are to he elected."
The facts concerning the charac
ter and aims of the American Inde
pendence conference, Itself, revealed
by these documents, are no less as
tounding that the disclosures which
inseparably link to its activities both
Candidate Iluuhes and his campaign
managers. These facts establish:
1 The personnel and character of
the promoters cf the so-called Amer
ican Independence confer nee as
shown by the roster of members of
its national campaign committee,
who, with Jeremiah O'Loary at
tended the meetings of that body
held at ivtroit on Sept. 7 and at

L' The alliance and cooperation
between the American Independence
ronfererce and the American Km
bargo conference as disclosed in the
report of the committee on plans of
the former organization and by the
fact that Will It. MaeDonald. sen
fral manager of the embargo con
ference is a member of the national
committee of the independertce con
ference. o. The permanence of its organ
ization and its uncovered purpose of
denominating American elections,
not only in this presidential cam
paign but, as pointedly proclaimed,
in all future elections.
. The purely racial and secret
purposes of the organization as a
weapon of vonpeance and force
against Anulo-Saxon influence as
revealed in the official report of the
committee on plans.
".. Its present and future mem

International News Service:
PA It IS, Oct. 2:i. The Austrian
cabinet has decided to resign to
morrow, according to a dispatch
from Heme.
A new cabinet, it is expected, will
be formed immediately after the
resipnation of the present povern
ment, whose reported decision to
resipn is the result of th assassin
ation Saturday of Count Stuerkh.
The new prernir is expected to be
either Prince Hohenlohe-Schillinps-furst,
Ilaron von Feck, former for
eipn minister, or Finance Minister
Ir. von Koerher.
Interna tinrnl Ne, Service:
(IFNFVA, Oct. 23. The assassin
ation of the Austrian premier, Count
Karl Stuertfkh. has been followed
by the discovery of a conspiracy
apainst Austria. The police and
military authorities have already
arrested a number of Polish, Croa
tian and Bohemian political leaders
says a dispatch from Vienna today.
Precautions have been taken by
the Austrian military officials to
suppress disorders in Vienna and
Budapest. Soldiers are patrolling
the streets of the two capitals.
Prince I lohenlohe-Schill inpsf urst.
Austrian minister of interior, who
will act as premier until the suc
cessor of Count Stuergkh is appoint
ed, has already assumed his new
dutits. It is expected that a new
prime minister will be appointed
this week.
Dr. Frederic II. Adler, the assas
sin, is in jail under a heavy puard
in Ferlin. Adler defends the shoot
ins: of Count Stuerpkh on the pround
that it was a "political necessity."
Adler I'mmI as Txd.
There is a disposition in some
quarters, according to Vienna ad
vices, that believe that Adler was
used as a tool by anti-povemment
plotters. There have lonp been
mutterinps of revolt apainst the
Austrian government anions' the
Bohemians, Croatians and Poles.
Whether or not Adler will be
brought to trial is uncertain. If
it is decided by the authorities that
he is insane he may be committed
to an institution for life. Among
those most prominently mentioned
as Count Stmrirkh's successor is
Prince Hohenlohe - Sohillinpsfurst.
The indications are tnat Germany
will attempt to take advantage of
the opportunity to strengthen her
influence over the Austrian govern

German policies appointed.

International News Servli:
WASHINGTON'. Oct. 23. The
first concrete result of the physical
valuation of railroads upon which
the interstate commerce commis
sion has been working for three
ears was announced today when
the commission issued a tentative
valuation of the Texas and Midland
railroad and of the Atlanta, Birm
ingham and Atlantic railway.
The valuations were today served
on the attorney general of th-? United
States, the governors and railroad
commissions of the states through
which the roads operate and upon
the roads themselves. Thirty days
is tfiven each of these parties to tile
any protest against the interstate
commerce commission's valuations.
The intent of the valuation is to
establish a basis for the fixing of
railroad rates in true proportion to
the value of property used for rail
road purposes.
legislators v ho supported the
valuation act said it would mean
the solution of the American rail
road prohlem. Today's announce
ment is just in time for use by the
New land's railroad inve tigatinp
committee which next month is to
endeavor to diagnose the malady of
the railroads.

has been a $2.ä27. 1 7 depreciation
