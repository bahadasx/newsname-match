ANXIETY I fT LABOR CENTERS
Committee Report Unusual Activity
in Districts Normally Counted
Republican.
. New York Oct. 23. That the next
House is to be Republican by a small
but comfortable working majority
was the report made yesterday to Na
tional Chairman William It. Willcox
by Representative Frank P. Woods of
Iowa, head of the Republican congTesa
ional campaign committee.
The committee has been conducting
its own campaign for the election of a
Republican House, with offices in this
city. Washington and Chicago. Con
gressman Woods, who puts in moot of
his time in Washington, passed yester
day in this city, conferring with Mr.
Willcox and with Senator John W.
Weeks of the senatorial committee,
with which the congressional commil
tee is cooperating.
The fight for the next House of Rei
resentatives has grown exceedingly
bitter in the last few weeks and it was
admitted by Republicans yesterday,
that the number of doubtful districts
had increased rather than diminished
in this time. It Is the labor centers
which are causing trouble.
Reports received by the commutes
show that Samuel Gonvpers and tlu
American Federation of Labor are at
work with speakers and literature in
every one of these districts, trying to
elect Democratic Congressmen, us.
ing the Adamson law as their chief
argument.
The political activities of the feder
ation, according to those in close
touch with this situation, exceed any
thing ever seen and the labor loader i
are making a terrific drive in many
districts which ordinarily would be
considered safely Republican. The re
sult of this lias been to make prog
nostications regarding the Congress
ional election difficult.
The Democratic majority in the pre
sent House in twenty-three. To insure
a Republican House the Republicans
must carry at least twelve of the Dem
ocratic districts and hold their pres
ent strength. While Congressman
Woods and his associates are not
ready as yet to give out any figures,
they have told Chairman Willcox and
other Republicans here that they ex
pect to win the House by at least ten
seats.
This is a most conservative esti
mate, however, and Is based on condi
tions as they are at the present time.
It is the general belief that conditions
will improve in the n$xt two weeks,
and some estimates of the probable
Republican majority are running as
high as eighteen.
A total of ninety Democratic dis
tricts are figured on ' as affording
chances for the Republicans 'n this
election, out of which the committee
is hopeful of securing at least thirty.
These are the States in which gains
are expected:
Maine, one; Rhode Island, one; New
York, two; Ohio, ' two; Missouri,
three; Kansas, two; Indiana, six; Il
linois, two; South Dakota, one; Okla
homa, two; California, three; Nebras
ka, one; Iowa, one; Washington, one;
West Virginia, two.
The committee's reports fail to
show that any of the Republican war
horses are in any serious danger this
year. 'Uncle Joe" Cannon, William
R. McKinley, Nicholas Longworth,,
Ebenezer Hill and James R. Mann; thu
present minority loader, are almost
certain of being returned, and should
the next House ba Republican it is
llkfly Mr. Mann would be chosen
Speaker.

Homer A. Lyons Catches Good-Sized
Animal Near Hunters Rest.
The skin of one of the largest bears
caught in this vicinity in years is nail
ed to the Ikirn door at the home of Ho
mer A. Lyons on County street. The
bear, a female was trapped near
Hunters' Rest and the skin and skull
were brought down from the mountain
by Mr. Lyons Saturday night.
Mr. Lyons estimated that the animal
would weigh fully 27a pounds which
would make it one of the largest ani
mals of its kind captured in this vicini
ty in a number of years. Few large
specimens have been taken in Ben
nington county in recent years, proba
bly for the reason that they axe given
sufficient time to grow before they are
cither shot or trapped.
For many years Mr. Lyons has trap
ped at least one bear in the mountains
east of the village. One year while
operating a saw mill in Glastenbury
he secured eight. The bear he secured
Saturday was one of the largest in the
lis:.
When Mr. Lyons applied at the town
clerk's office tor the state bounty ho
was Informed by the clerk that their
had been no claim presented at the
office since Mr. Lyons made Ills last
application in 1015.
A bear weighing 4S pounds wa
killed in the town of Jamaica last week
by two men while hunting hedgehogs.
The bear was treed by dogs and shot.

in Swamp.

log and fell headlong into the mud,
was too weak to cxtricuto himself and
suffocated. The police have been
reaching that section and the sur
rounding mountain sides ever since

BY FORCES UNDER
BKE-I1SEII
Teutons and Bulgars Win Impor
tant Rumanian Seaport
RUSSO-RUMANIANS ROUTED
Central Powers Consider Victory
Greatest Since Rumania
Entered the War.
Berlin, Oct. 23. Constanza, the
big Rumanian seaport, has been cap
tured by Ge. Mackensen, the war of
fice announced today.
The capture of the port is consider
ed by the German and Bulgarian gov
ernments to be the most important
success of the central powers since
Rumania entered the wur.
German and Bulgarian war offices
announce that the Russorumanlan
armies have suffered a disastrous
rout.
In the face of continued violent at
tacks by the Teutonic allies in Dobru
dia from the Danube to the Black sea
the Rumanians and their Russian al
lies are still falling back. The towns
of Toprai Sari, 14 miles southwest
of Constana. and Cobadin, 17 miles
southeast of the Danube town of Rac
hova, have been taken by the com
by Berlin to be in pursuit of their de
feated antagonists.
On the Transylvania front hard
fighting continues in the mountain
passes but with the result In doubt,
owing to the conflicting statements of
the Berlin, Petrograd and Bucharest
war offices. Petrograd says the Ru
manians have been forced back In the
Buzen valley. Bucharest, however,
does not concede this, asserting that
counter-attacks by the Teutonic allies
there were repulsed at the point of
the bayonet, it Is evident from the
official statements, despito their dis
crepancies as to results, that no great
changes in position have taken place
anywhere along their front, but that
the Rumanians are fighting tenacious
ly to hold back the would-be invaders
of their country.
The battle of the past week along
the Narayuvka river in Calieia has re
sulted in an Important victory for the
Austro-Ovrman fortes over the Rus
sians, according to Berlin. There
the Russians now hold only a small
part of the front on the west bank of
the river, following a general attack
by the Teutmiic allies between Svitol
nikl and Skofovochy, in which the Rus
sians were driven back, suffering
heavy casualties. Petrograd says,
however, that the fighting along the
river is still in pi ogress and that the
positions have changed hands several
times.
Twice during Sunday, in the morn
ing and in the afternoon, the Germans
launched violent attacks against the
newly-won French positions In the
Chaulnes wood, south of the Somme
river in France. Iloth attacks were
repulsed. the Germans suffering
heavy casualties, says Paris. Some of
the attackers in the morning offensive
gained a foothold in tilt French first
line, but were surrounded and the 150
survivors taken prisoner.
Berlin, in admitting that In Satur
day's lighting the Uritish north of the
Somme made gains, characterizes the
British losses as a "reckless sacrifice
of human lives." Several trendies be
tween Biachse and Lamaisonette
south of the Somme, were recaptured
Saturday lrom the French, says
Berlin.
"Those Ignorant Foreigners"
Three men were arraigned before
Magistrate Appleton in New York
city, charged with smoking in a fac
tory. Two of them were fined $20
each. A third, addressing the court,
explained :
"My case is dilferont from those
others. I was bom in America and
am well educated. You should have
more consideration for me, because I
am not a ignorant foreigner like those
otherii."
The magistrate was equal to his
duty and fined the man $30, insteud of
$20, on the ground that the native
born offender should have known
enough to obey the law. The case Is
a fairlv typical one. How many native-born
Americans. Intelligent and
educated, ussume that they have a
right to do, contrary to law, that
which ignorant foieigners should not
lie permitted to do.
Only this week in this city one of
the most dangerous and persistent
automobile speeders was heard de
claiming in a public place concerning
the Iniquity ef ignorant foreigners
who shoot game out of season, in his
opinion, apparently, It is all right for
intelligent Americans, knowing the
law, to defy the law nt the risk ef hu
man life, but for a foreigner who does
not know the law the shooting of a
bird should bo enough to consign him
to solitary imprisonment. Boston

ASSASSINATION OF STUERGKH
Shooting Of Austrian Premier Purely
Political.
Vienna, Oct. 23. The assassination
of the Austrian premier. Count Karl
Stuergkh, was purely political and was
induced by his refusal to convene Par
liament according to the admission of
Dr. Friedrich Adler, his assailant,
soon after his arrest. Dr. Adler is an
eccentric and sutierradlcal socialist,
sometimes known as the "Liebknecht
eif Austria." He is editor of Der
Kamp'.
Dr. Adler's arrest was not accom
plished without the wounding of two
men who leaped at him after he had
fired on County Stuergkh. He dis
charged the two remaining chambers
of his revolver at these men before
Austrian and German officers, with
drawn saheis, overpowered him. The
wounded men, who were injured
slightly, are Baron Aehrentahal, broth
er of the late foreign minister, and
the head waiter of the Hotel Meis
slund Sehadn, in which the shooting
ocurred.
Count Stuergkh arrived at the ho
tel nt 1.30 o'clock. With him at lunch
eon were Huron Aehienthal. Count
Toggenbtirg, governor of the Tyrol;
llerr Jacobson, a prominent Vienna
musician and an actor from the Court
theater. At 2 o'clock a man unknown
to the premier arrived and took a
seat three tables away. He ate lunch
eon and paid for the meal, but linger
ed at the table. Just after 3 o'clock
he arose advanced rapidly toward the
premier and fired three shots. The
first missed. The next two struck the
premier in the head. Without a wr.nl
Count Stuergkh fell back lifeless In
his chair.
The assassin, who Is 32 is a son
of Dr. Victor Adler, a Reichsrat depu
ty and a socialist of mild type. By
a strange coincidence the rather was
speaking before the Reichsrat In It'll
when Count Stuergkh was shot nt
six times by the Dalmatian socialist
Vakusch. I On thut occasion the count
was uninjured.

Steamship.
Cleveland. (.)., Oct. 23. Lake Erie's
total death list on what is In shipping
circles now known as "Black Friday"
is now placed at 48. In addition to
the lives lost in the sinking of the
James B. Colgate and the D. T. Filer
there is eery reason to believe that
the entire crew of the steamer Mer
ida, 25, in number have been drowned.
Bodies wearing life belts marked
"Merida" were brought into Toledo
today.
Cleveland, Oct. 22. Storm-swept
Lake Erie today gave up the story of
the drowning of twenty-one men and
the loss of the whaieback steamship
James B. Colgate. The big steel ship
sailed from Buffalo Friday morning
for Fort William with coal. It sank
that night off Long Point, Canada. Its
master, Captain Walter Grashaw of
this city, drifted on a raft for two
nights and a day before be was res
cued by the ferry steamship Mar
eiuette and Bessemer 2 off Rondeau,
Canada. Half dead from exposure, he
was brought ashore late today at Con
neaut, Ohio.
Every one of the crew of twenty-one
perished, nineteen when the Colgate
foundered in Friday's storm and two
when exhaustion forced them to re
linquish ther hold on the ratt that car
ried their captain. The lone survivor
was unable today to give a list of his
crew, owing to the many changes
nride at Buffalo just before the vessel
sailed. Of the men shipped at Buf
falo, however, eight are known to
have been from New York state
points.
The drowning of the Colgate's crew
raised the casualties of "Black Fri
day." as it is known in marine circles,
to twenty-seven. Six men were lost
when the steamship Filler sank .in
Lake Erie on Friday, only Captain
Mattison being saved. Earlier that
night the steamship Marshall F. But
ters foundered, but its crew of thir
teen men were saved. Less than an
house after the Filler sank, the Col
gate, by far the largest of the three
victim vessels, went down.
WATCH FOR BANCS ON DUCKS

DESPERADOES CAUGHT BY POSSE
Captured in Nearby Field With Good
Stolen From House in Their ;
Possession.
Pittsfield, Oct. 23. Bulgary in the
real old-fashioned desperado style was
committed in Hancock Saturday night
and as a result Harry Coons, about 21
of Hancock and Edward Eackliee,
about 20, a state road worker on the
Lebanon mountain highway, were
brought here yesterday afternoon by
Deputy Sheriff Frank M. White to an
swer to charges of breaking ana en
tering in the night time with intent
to commit burglary.
The Misses Lousla Smith 80, and
Llda Smith, 77, who live together in
a house in Hancock near the Leb
anon line, were awakened about 10.30
o'colck Saturday night by loud knock
ings on their front door. Answering -the
call through an upstairs window,
one of thme received demands for ad
mittance. She refused the demands
and she saw two men with their faces
covered with masks and their hats
well down over their foreheads.
The refusal was greeted with
three shots from a revolver through
the window she had closed, the bul
lets imbedding themselves in the
walls of the room. The two aged wo
men hastily donned clothing and, es
caping through a back door, went to a
neighbor's home.
Soon afterward they returned with
male members of the neighbor's fam
ily and found their home completely
ransacked.
An alarm was sounded through
one section of Hancock and a posse
was organized, consisting of W. P.
Decker, Earl Hemenway, LeRoy Wil
liams E. F. Chapman and Euclid Rlng
ner. While walking along a road, they
heard a noise in a field close by.
Flashlights were turned In the direc
tion from which the sound came and
two men were seen. They were cov
ered with guns by the posse and com
pelled to hold their hands above
their heads until searched. A revol
