Will Return Local
Girl to Reformatory
' A requisition has been issued by
Governor Withycombe upon Governor
Johnson of California for the return
of Winifred Coldwell, who escaped
with a number of girls from the State
Industrial School for Girls recently.
She was apprehended in Oakland and
refuses to return voluntarily. Gov
ernor Johnson has advised Governor
Withycombe that he will honor the
requisition Immediately upon its ar
rival. The Coldwell girl was formerly a
resident of Ashland and was commit
ted to the state school from here.
The Coldwell girl is now at Hilt
ia the custody of Mrs. K. Doaii, Uate
patrol officer. Mrs. Doan must await
the arrival of extradition papers
there before bringing the girl into
Oregon. Mrs. E. M. Hopkins and
Sheriff William Esch of Marion coun
ty were also in Ashland Saturday,
presumably on the same case.
The Coldwell girl escaped from the
state school some time ago and was
harbored with the two other girls
who got away with her, near Salem.
According to officials, Mrs. Coldwell
and some man from Ashland went up
and brought her daughter and one
other girl here, where they stayed for
a couple ot days. They were then
taken over the line into California.
The other girl is at Sacramento.
Hot Time at City

There will be a hot time at the
city hall tomorrow (Tuesday) even

rather your eye, for a minute. Im
agine the warmth which will result
from a four-cornered debate by rep
resentatives of each leading politi
cal party and ending in a straw vote
for president. It is true, and it will
be well worth hearing. The debate
is to be held under the auspices of
the Men's Social Service League, re
placing their regular monthly meet
ing, or rather being a feature of the
meeting. All men are invited to be
present. The speakers will each
have fifteen minutes, not a second
more, to defend their party and can
didates. J. H. Fuller of Talent will
explain the fine points about mules.
O. C. Boggs of Medford will put the
elephant through his paces, W. H.
Breese of Talent will uphold the so
cialist doctrines without waving a
red flag, and O. H. Barnhill of Ash
land will demonstrate the 1916 mod
el water wagon.

Base for Lincoln
Statue in Place
The immense granite boulder
which IS to form the base for the
statue of Abraham Lincoln, which
G. S. Butler will erect in Lithla
park, is in place. The native rock,
about four feet in diameter by five
feet in height, was brought down
from Ashland canyon and will make
an Ideal base for the statue, being
symbolic of the plain, unyielding
character of the great emancipator.
It was quit? a job to get the big
boulder In place, a scaffolding and
ten-ton block and tackle being used.
The rock Is set In cement.
The statue of Lincoln has arrived
tit America' from Italy and is on its
I way to Ashland. Mr. Butler con
ceived the idea of procuring a statue
of Lincoln when at the San Francisco
j exposition and ordered it. It will be
j presented to Lithla park as a me
, morial to Jacob Thompson, step
j father of Mr. Butler and a pioneer
: of southern Oregon of 1847, now de
ceased. The statue Is the work of
i A. Frilll. Italian sculptor, and Is over
j six feet in height, of marble.

Watson's Farm
Magazine Out
W. W. Watson was up from Med
ford Thursday, distributing to his
Ashland friends some of the first
copies of "Oregon Farm and Or
chard," a new bi-monthly publica
tion devoted in the main to farming
and fruit Interests in the Rogue Riv
er valley, and of which Mr. Watson
is editor and owner. The publica
tion is in magazine shape and has
twenty pages of live reading matter,
printed on excellent paper and re
plete with cuts. Mr. Watson has a
number of authorities on various
subjects on his staff and is getting
out a magazine which will be appre
ciated by the farmers and the town
folks as well in the valley. The pa
per is published in Medford, and the
editorial page devotes considerable
space to Medford problems. Med
ford merchants patronize the paper
well with advertising. Mr. Watson
states that he is distributing 3,000
copies of the paper.

at Wedderburn Is the largest in 35

Wants Redwood
Tract for Park
Governor Withycombe has written
the Brookings Lumber Company of
Brookings, suggesting that it donate
a grove of California redwood, own
ed by it In Curry county, to the state
as a park. The grove covers approx
imately a section, and is said to be
the only redwood tract in Oregon.
Helping Hand
For Ex-Convicts
With the view of making the pa
role system more efficient and less
expensive, Governor Withycombe In
the near future will appoint counsel
ors for paroled prisoners In all of
the larger cities In the state. The
governor has been considering such
a plan for the strengthening of the
system for some time, and Is confi
dent that it will prove successful.
Under the present system all of
the. paroled prisoners are under the
jurisdiction of Parole Officer Keller,
and In addition to procuring employ
ment for them before they leave the
prison, he must see to It that they
are continuously employed, and ad
vise with them when they are In dif
ficulty. This Is proving more or less
expensive as frequently he Is forced
to make trips into remote portions
Of the state, Counselors at all of
the Important towns of the state
would reduce the expense, and the
paroled prisoners would always be
provided with the Immediate advice
of a friend when in difficulty.
The postlon will be non-salaried,
and the names of the counselors will
only be known to the governor, pa
role officer and paroled prisoner.
Under the plan a prisoner when pa
roled will be advised as to whom his
counselor will be, and the counselor
asked to counsel with the paroled
prisoner and give him every aid that
he may make good.
Klamath Wins from
Grants Pass 56-0
By the overwhelming score of 56-0
the Klamath Falls football team wal
loped Grants Pass at the Falls Sat
urday, and as a result Ashland fans
have got a hollow feeling of fear.
Klamath cames to Ashland Thursday
of this week, and as the best Ashland
rolled up against the Pass was 6-0,
the comparison leaves far from
cheerful feelings. However, the boys
believe that they are about thirty
points hetter than Grants Pass and
are determined to uphold the honor
of the red and white. It will he
some game, anyway.
Other Scores.
. Other football results of Interest
were: i
Oregon Agricultural College de
feated by Nebraska at Portland 17-7.
University of Oregon defeated
University of California 39 to 14 at
Berkeley.
CorvnlHs high beat Eugene high
at Eugene 16 to 0.
Everett high walloped Franklin
high of Portland by the record
breaking score of 121 to 0.
Most of the big eastern colleges
met weaker teams and no upsets re
sulted. Vining Holds Straw
Vote for President
The Vining Theatre is holding a
straw vote on the various presiden
tial candidates this week which will
be watched with much Interest by
the citizens of Ashland. Beginning
tonight, every admittance to the
theatre will be accompanied by a
ballot which has the names of the
four candidate's. The ballot should
be marked with a cross opposite the
candidate of the voter having it and
deposited In a ballot box in the lobby
for the purpose. Saturday night the
votes will be counted and the results
made known.
Payne Builds New
Pews for
Church
The contract for the new
which the Congregational church Is
to have as a result of a bequest led
by Mrs. D. R. Mills, has been let to
E. C. Payne, who is building them.
The new furniture will be Installed
some time next month. "
No Farm Loans on
Second Mortgages
According to an announcement
made by the farm loan board Friday,
no second- mortgages for loans will
be accepted. The impression has
gained currency among many farm
ers that a second mortgage was no
bar to federal money.
First Football
Game Thursday
The first opportunity which Ash
land sport lovers will have of seeing
the Ashland high school team in Ash
land will be afforded Thursday af
ternoon of this week when the locals
will go up against the strongest team
that Klamath Falls has sent into the
KoL'ue valley in years. The school
will be dismissed at 2:30 and the
game called at 3. The 56-0 defeat
of Grants Pass at the Falls Saturday
has resulted in a sudden arousal of
a wonderful burst of Interest among
the townspeople. Everyone realizes
that if the locals can defeat Klamath
it will be a wonderful game, and the
attendance should be a record break
er. The stores of the city are asked
to close if they will and to send all
of the clerks which they can let go,
to the game at any rate. There will
be a rousing street rally by the high
school students Wednesday night.
Admission to the game will be 25
Cents.
Although quite demoralized by the
Injuries received In the Grants Pass
game, the local team is getting into
fair shape, with many noticeable
changes. Brower Is out of the game
for the season and Bentley, another
regular back, will probably be able
to play but a few minutes if at all.
End Kirk Is out for the season. Lowe
has been shifted to the backfield, as
has also Winnie, and Leavltt on an
end. The boys are "there" with the
fight and intend to put up an exhibi
tion worth seeing.
riineral Water
Values Increase
The number of active mineral
springs in the United States in 1915,
according to figures compiled by the
United States Geological Survey, De
partment of the Interior, was smaller
and the production was less, though
the value was greater, than In 1914.
Statistics reported from 829 com
mercial springs show that the total
production was 54,358,466 gallons,
valued at $4,892,328. The decrease
in production was 2,444,963 gallons,
or 4 per cent. The Increase In value
of medicinal waters was $60,506 and
In the value of table waters $185,
960; thus the total Increase in value
of sales was $246,466, or 5 per cent.
The Increase in business is slightly
less than the decrease in Imports of
foreign waters, and this, coupled
with the Increase of price per gallon
from 9 to 10 cents, indicates in
creased sales of moderately high
priced domestic waters that have be
comet valuable substitutes for waters
previously Imported.
Jew York led In number of com
merclal springs and In quantity of
mineral water sold and was second
to Wisconsin in total value of pro
duction and In value of table waters.
California was first and Indiana was
second In value of medicinal waters.

Terrible Bailey
Hill Is No More
The "worst piece of road on the
Pacific coast," as It Is designated by
touring autolsts, the Bailey hill
grade in northern California, has
been eliminated by the opening up
Saturday of what is known as the
Bailey 'hill tunnel, a fifty-foot tunnel
under, the railroad track. The maxi
mum grade of 6 per cent of the Pa
cific Highway over the Slskiyous met
with an awful setback at Bailey hill,
where a rocky and steep road has
been in use for over a year while
awaiting the completion of the tun
nel. The detour road In the last few
weeks has become almost Impassable
and the opening of the highwayls
received with much thankfulness.
The tunnel is completed all but fill-

Political Class
Solid for Normal
At th meeting ol the Ashland po
litical science class held Saturday,
the ladies, of whom there were about
fifty present, voted unanimously In
favor of the establishment of the
Pendleton normal by the passage of
the jnoposcd amendment. The nor
mal amendment and tho Sunday blue
law were discussed, the latter espec
ially giving rise to some quite heated
discussion. The house was divided

lng to commit themselves. The meet

Graded, Says News
News. The grading of
Yreka
I tnreo milca ( t,e tate highway at
Grenada Is now In progress. The
expense to the county, after the cor
rugated Iron culverts have been fur
nished by the state, Is approximately
' $2.r0 per mile. In case the state
would do this work the cost to the
people would be $1,000 per mile.
The Increase would be due to the
fact that the state machinery and
other equipment would have to be
moved to the point . of operation,
camps established, etc. Siskiyou
county could grade the road to Ga
zelle while at work on this end and
thus save the people of this county
considerable money. Siskiyou coun
ty is doing the work at Grenada In
compliance with a request from the
land owners who on donating the
right-of-way asked that the grading
be done at once. '

ed the application of the Southern
Pacific Compuny for permission to
establish a rate of 15 cents for 100'
pounds of sugar in carload lots, with
