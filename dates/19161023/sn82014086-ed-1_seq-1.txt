GAM 1 DOBRUDJA
! Rumanians and Russians Are Unable to Withstand
Continued Violent Attacks
GERMANIC ALLIES PURSUING DEFEATED ARMIES
Offensive Has Been Taken by the Combined Austrian, Ger
man, Bulgarian and Turkish Forces Conflicting Re
ports Are Made of the Hard Fighting on the Transyl
vania Front Violent Attacks of Germans Against New
ly Won Positions of French in the Chaulness Wood
Were Repulsed Heavy Rainstorms and Snowfall Are
Impeding Operations in the Austro-Italian Theatre.
In the face of continued violent at
tacks by the Teutonic allies in Do
brudja, from the Danube to the Black
sea, the Rumanians and their Russian
allies are still falling back.
The towns of Toprai Sari, fourteen
miles southwest of Constanza, and
Cobadin, 17 miles southeast of the
Danube town of Rachova, have been
taken by the combined Austrian. Ger
man, Bulgarian and Turkish forces,
who are declared by Berlin to be in
pursuit of their defeated antagonists.
On the Transylvania front hard
fighting1 continues in the mountain
passes, but with the result in doubt,
owing to the conflicting statements of
the Berlin, Petrograd and Bucharest
war offices. . Petrograd says the Ru
manians have been forced back in the
Buseu valley. Bucharest, however, does
not concede this, asserting that counter-attacks
iby the Teutonic allies here
were repulsed at the point of the bay
onet. It is evident from the official
statements, despite their discrepan
cies as to results, that no great
changes in position, have taken place
anywhere along this front, but that the
Rumanians are fighting tenaciously to
hold back the would-be invaders of
their country.
The battle of the past week along
the Narayuvka river in Galicia has re
sulted in an important victory for the
Austro-German forces over the Rus
sians, according to Berlin. Here the
Russians now hold only a small part
of the front on the west bank of the
river, following a general attack by the
Teutonic allies between Svitelnlki and
Ekomovochy, in which the Russians

were driven back suffering heavy cas
ualties. Petrograd says, however, that
the fighting along the river is still in
progress and that the positions have
changed hands several times.
Twice during Suntlay in the morn
ing and in the afternoon the Ger
mans launched violent attacks against
the newly won French positions in the
Chaulnes Wood, south of the Somme
river in France. Both attacks were
repulsed, the Germans suffering heavy
casualties, says Paris. Some of the
attackers in the morning offensive
gained a foothold in the French first
line, but were surrounded and the 150
survivors taken prisoners.
Berlin in admitting that in Satur
day's fighting the British north of the
Somme made gains, characterizes the
British losses as a "reckless sacrifice
of human lives." Several trenches be
tween iBiaches and La Maisonnette,
south of the Somme, were recaptured
Saturday from the French, says Ber
lin. Despite bad weather on the Mace
donian front slight additional progress
has been made by the entente allies in
the Cerna River region. German
troops are now aiding their Bulgarian
allies in the fighting at the bend of
the Cerna.

same aircraft that was destroyed later
and fell into "the sea under the attack
of a British naval aeroplane.

STEAMSHIP JAMES B. COLGATE
FOUNDERED FRIDAY NIGHT
ONLY ONE SURVIVOR
Nineteen of Crew Were Sucked Dbwn
With the Big Boaty-Two Others
Were Washed Off Raft and Drowned
A Series of Disasters Reported.
Cleveland, Ohio. Oct. 2. News that
the steamship James B. Colgate had
foundered in Lake Erie Friday night
and that the crew of 21 men had per
ished was .brought here today by Cap
tain Walter Grashaw. the sole sur
vivor, who was rescued after being
adrift on a raft for 34 1-2 hours.
The vessel went down off Long
Point, Canada, opposite Krie. Captain
Grashaw was landed at Conneaut,
Ohio, half dead from exposure to the
fury of the storm.
Nineteen of the crew were sucked
down to death when the big steel
boat foundered-and two others on the
raft with the captain were washed off
and drowned.
Series of Disasters.
The Colgate sank the night of what
has been termed "Black Friday" in
marine circles. Six men were lost
when the steamer Filer sank in Lake
Erie on Friday, only Capt. Mattison
being saved. Earlier that night the
steamer Marshal F. Butters foundered
but the crew of thirteen men were
saved.
Less than an hour after the Filer
sank, the Colgate, largest of the three
vessels, went down miles away. The
loss of her crew has raised "Black
Friday's" casualty list on Lake Erie
to 27.
At first Captain Grashaw was un
able to tell the names of his two com
panions on the raft. When he recov
ered a little he said they were Sec
ond Engineer Harry Osman of Cleve
land and a coal passer whose name he
did not know and who had shipped at
Buffalo, X. Y., just before the Colgate
left there Friday morning on its way
to Fort William. Canada, with coal.
Captain Grashaw's Story.
Captain Grashaw's story follows:
"We were passing Long Point about
6 or 7 o'clock Fridav night when the
ship sprang a leak forward. All hands
were at aft, at the time and immedi
ately we could feel her tipping and
settling at the head.
"Every man worked for his life then,
but it was no use. By 10 o'clock the
storm had increased so that the Col
gate didn't have a chance. The tale
was terrific, rain was driving nnd the
waves pounded. We got the life rnft
ready just as .the boat was so far
down that her decks were awash.
Everybody Jumped Into Water.
"When she sank everyhody jumped
Into the water. I went down and
when I came up by some chance my
hand touched the raft. I grabbed It
and pulled myself on it just as Sec
ond Engineer Harry Osmnn and the
coal passer reached it. What hap
pened to the others I don't know. I
never saw them again. They must
have been sucked right down with the
ship.
Awful Fiqht for Life.
"Then our awful fight began some
thing I'll never forget. Twice the
raft turned completely over and we
were washed loose, but we managed to
regain our holds. I must have been
unconscious half the time for now I
can't remember distinguishing night
from day while the storm went on and
our raft plunged with us, never once
in sight of a shin that might rescue
us until this moiing.
"First the coal passer was washed
away. Then hours later Osman, to
lally exhausted, was swept to hi
death. How I managed to keep on tha
raft I do not know. Time and again
it turned over with me. Each time I
had to fight my way on top again."
