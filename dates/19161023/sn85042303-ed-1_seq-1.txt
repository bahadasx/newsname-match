TENNESSEE
PRISONERS ON
HIGHWAYS
CONVICTS ARE PAID ONE DOLLAR
PER DAY TO BUILD GOOD ROADS
HAVE BETTER HEALTH AND
SPIRITS.
"We have worked 400 men on the
highways during this year, and the
results have been highly satisfactory,"
states the president of the Tennessee
state board of contfo. fn a recent let
ter to Adolph LewlBOhn, president of
the national committee on prisons.
"The last legislature took a step
forward," continues the Tennessee of.
ficlal, "in the enactment of a law au
thorizing the board of control to con
tract the labor of convicts on the pub
lic highways from April 1 to December
1 at the price of $1 per day. We
maintain the men on the $1 per day,
but make little if any profit. The men
thus employed are in better health
and better condition in every day as a
result of the outdoor employment and
the state has in this way made a sub
stantial contribution to the good roads
cause. Next year we expect to have
one thousand men working on the
highways."
The Tennesseo Hoard of Control is
committed to the abolishment of the
contract system at the next legisla
ture, and Is endeavoring to secure an
act which will enable all prisoners
to be employed on roads and farms
or in the manufacture of. commodities
for use in the state and county insti
tutions and departments.
The board is endeavoring to develop
the road work on an efficient basis
nnd has asked the national committee
on prisons for data concerning the
most practical and economical meth
ods of housing, feeding, and caring
for prisoners when working on the
roads. The committee has furnished
scientific Information gathered by
graduate students of the department
of highway engineering at Columbia
University who have made nation
wide studies of convict road work
under the Joint direction of the de
partment and the national committee
on prisons.
The application of scientific meth
ods to the road work already well un
der way in Tennessee Insures further
success and will encourage the board
of control in its effort to develop all
the prison Industries or the state on a
right basis.
