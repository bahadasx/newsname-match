Superintendent of Cumbler

ASSISTANT MANGLED
3,()00 Pounds of Explosive Acci
dentally "Shot" While Being
Placed in Bock
Two men were killed and one ser
iously injured at 10 o'clock this morn
ing when dynamite exploded in the
Q-' W. Cumbler Estate quarries, on
the outskirts of Steelton.
The dead are Ross Smeltzer, aged
52 years, of Dressier, and Frank
Wonderly, aged 36, of Highsph-e.
Smeltzer's body was buried beneath a
pile of rocks and had not been found
late this afternoon. Wonderly was
picked up, baaiv mangled, and rushed
to the Bethlehem Steel Company hos
pital, where he died a few minutes
later. William Martu, aged 2 5 years,
of Bressler, was badly burned about
the face and body and may die.
The cause of the explosion is not
known. The three men, according to
C. C. Cumbler, a member of the firm,
were "loading holes" on top a sec
tion of rocks which they planned to
"shoot" to-night. They were work
ing on the sixth hole and were putting
the cap in the hole, when the explos
ion occurred.
Witnesses say that Smeltzer was do
ing' the work and Wonderly and
Martz were standing nearby. When
the two men saw the flames, they ran.
Smeltzer did not. move and was
thrown underneath the rocks. Won
derly ran up over the bluff hut was
caught by flying stones. Martz for
tunately escaped the flying stones,
' Uils burned by the blazing powder.
T he men had filled five holes, each
of which holds approximately 500 lbs.
of dynamite. The sixth hole had been
jilled and the cap was being placed
In position when the explosion took
place. The jar of the one explosion
is thought to have caused the five

Many tons of rock were sent flying
down the bluffs. Many of the men
engaged in work at the foot of the

DEEPENING SftMß £Wi\ -J
STEPS fr/jjg
THIS accompanying illustration shows an effective and economical treatment of the River Bank, along the lines
suggested by Philander C. Knox during a recent visit here. The method of treatment was worked out by
Ernest I* Worrell, of the Berryhill Nursery Co., and is original with him. It provides that the big rocks
which now block the channel at many parts of the river b* taken out whole and brought in flats to the river shore.
These Mr. Morrell would raise to the ban., above the steps by means of a traveling steain crane running on the
concrete path at the top of the wall. The big boulders would be laid as high as the flood line and being heavy
would remain there. Pockets of soil would be arrange 1 for the planting of vines and the vines would be cut back
to roots each Fall in order to prevent them from being pulled out by high water. Above the rip-rap thus formed
Mr. Morrell would have a mixed planting of the following, with a possible use also, of small evergreens: Golden
bell, dwarf bush honeysuckle, bridal wreath, Japanese barberry, fragrant white azalea, mountain laurel, dogwood
hawthorn, dwarf deutzla, witch hazel, Kegel's privet, dwarf sumach, fragrant sumach, elderberry, flowering rasp
berry, snow berry, coral berry, weigelia, wild roses, Japanese roses, creeping roses, evergreen honeysuckle, Virginia
creeper, bittersweet, elimatis, low-growing willow, spreading Juniper, red cedar, Swiss mountain pine, Mugho pine.
Thus the river would be cleared of rocks and the rip-rapping would be done at one cost.

9-CENT MILK

Betail Dealers Fight to Keep

PBODUCEBS BESPONSIBLE
holcsalors Want to Increase
to $ .20 Gallon Whole
sale
Retail milk dealers in the city will
meet to-night in Maennerclior Hall,
North and Church streets, to start a
movement to prevent a raise in the
wholesale cost of milk, which will
mean an Increase to 9 cents a Quart in
retail price.
The meeting is the result of the ses
sion which dairymen of Dauphin and
Cumberland counties held last week
at the farm of A. J. Holtzman. The
dairymen are plannig an increase in
, price, it was said. At present they are
[receiving 16 cents a gallon from city
j dealers, who then sell the milk at
cents.
That an increase is inevitable is the
opinion of the retaif men. They are
now planning a fight to keep the
wholesale price at IS cents a gallon
during the entire year. This increase
will necessitate raising the retail price
to S cents a quart, they claim. If,
however, the dairy farm men decide
to boost the price 4 cents a gallon, city
(lctilers will probably raise to 9 cents a
quart. At the meeting to-night action
will be taken and the farmers will be
notified at I heir meeting to-morrow
night at Penbrook.
Increased cost of food, labor and
supplies is the reason advanced by
dairymen who are planning to jump
the price. Retail dealers claim that
the raise will cut down their business.
