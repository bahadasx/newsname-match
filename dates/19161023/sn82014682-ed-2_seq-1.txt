In, was admitted today by its mem

their parts of the purchase price by
the members may have to take place.
According to the plans worked out
beforehand, the Hawaiian Electric
Company, is to erect a new office
hnildlnsr at the corner of Kine and
Bishop streets, and the Mcinerny
brother8, will take the rest or tne
Kine street frontaere on which to build
an office building, both buildings to be
four stories high; and Castle & uooke
takes the rest of the land."
With the price, however, going

the first two members are today un
certain how the deal will work out,
as the increase is more than they ex
nected to Day. A meeting will be held
in the next few days to decide this
tiuestion, and It is expected that some
solution favorable to all will be set
tled upon.. In the meantime, however,
a member ot Castle &r Cooke said to
day that if the other two do not care
to take up their options, hlscompany
will buy it all.
Taxes Likely to Be Raited v

probably be in the neighborhood of 25
per cent Bishop park, across King
street, is assessed on a valuation of
$298,300 and the two properties are
annroxlraately the same in size, Bish
op park being slightly larger. The
Bishop property on Bishop and King
streets, extending 110 feet from the
corner, is assessed $10 a foot and
Wilder said today that he expected it
would co very close to $12.50, though
naturally' he is speaking offhand.
As Castle & uooKe nas a lease oi
four years more on its present build
ing, the company has not decided yet
on any future plans in regard? to the
new site and nothing will be done un

the price bid to Washington bnt did
not know how soon he would receive
a reply. "They , may answer - by

German Who Hid In Sierra is
, Cause of Excitement Here;
Tells Conflicting Tales
Is Carl Kosler. or Kressler: a form
er German spy of Sydney?
When the Oceanic steamer sierra
arrived this morning from San Fran
cisco, a German stowaway of that
name was on board and was put off
here. He stowed away in . 3an Fran
cisco with the intention, he told of
ficers of the boat, of going to Sydney
to get work.
According to officers of the steam
er, Kosler hid in the hold until after
the Sierra had passed ' the Golden
Gate. Then he appeared in the steer
age at supper time when the gong was
rung and on checking np the steerage
passengers, the steward discovered
the man to be a stowaway.
Harbor Officer A. E. Carter, learn
ing of the German's presence on the
Sierra, went aboard and was told, he
says, by Chief Officer P. F. Johnson,
that Kosler had jpaie. ashore. Carter
rsmnnatmliul n-Hh Inhnonh fnr lttinS'
the man go" free before the poHce had.
a chance to interview nim.
Carter then went aft and found Kos
ler in the steerage. Talking with him
but not revealing his identity as har
bor detective. Carter was told by Kos
ler, whose name in the ship's list Is
given as Carl Kressler, that he had
been interned in Australia at a camp
with other Germans, had fallen ill,
been sent to the hospital and later
got away oh the Ventura and had gone
to San. Francisco, where he had been
nnable to get work, so stowed away
on the Sierra, intending to come here
to work on the Tefugee German mer
chant steamer Pommern, whose cap
tain he had seen when he was on his
way to San Francisco on the Ventura
five months ago.. c
Kosler was taken to the German
consulate here by Carter to explain
himself to German Consul Georg Ro
diek. The consul was busy at the
time and so Kosler told his story to
an officer of the Pommern, who was
at the consulate then. Talking in
German, the man told the ship's offi
cer that he had worked as a "runner"
for the German consulate in Sydney
before leaving Australia. Kosler was
then taken aboard the Pommern,
where the captain of the freighter told
Detective Carter he would take care
of the stowaway if this arrangement
would be satisfactory to the police.
Carter agreed and the German is
staying on the Pommern this af ter-
noon.
