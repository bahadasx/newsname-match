Russ Aiding Rumanians.
The Rumanians with Russian help
are apparently making successful
'u stands in the various passes leading
? from Transylvanian to Rumanian ter-
ti ritory. In some of these hilly regions,
notably in the Trotus, Oituz and Slan.
i ic valleys, Rumanian forces are re
ported by Petrograd to have driven
; General Falkenhayn's troops slightly
backward.
On the western front along the
Somme, the French have made anoth
er successful push in the vicinity of

the spur known as Number 12S north-
west of Sallly-Saillisel, according to-
: day's Paris bulletin.
Galiclan Battle Slackening.
Petrograd reports the slackening of
; the battle In the Narayuvka river
region in Galicia, where Berlin and

Important Teutonic victory had been
gained. The repulse of a Teutonic at-
! tempt to cross the Boldurka north of
Brody, in the district northeast of

t town, following yesterday's raid on

I Fort Constanza Captured.
Berlin, Oct 23, via London, 5:45 p.
X m The Rumanian fort of. Constanza
has been captured by the Germans,
i j the war office announced today.
i Troops of the central powers have
i 4 crossed the railway line running be
tween the Black seaport of Constanza
$ and the river Danube at a point to the
' east of Murfattar, the official nn
: nouncement says. The fortress of
Constanza -was taken by German and
Bulgarian troops.
On the left wing of Field Marshal
von Mackensen's army, the slale
J ment adds, the Germans and their al
I j lies are approaching the Danube town
of Tchernavoda.
) ' Constanza was one of the principal
I : objectives of Field Marshal von Mack-
ensen in his campaign in Dobrudja. It
Is of particular importance by reason
; of the fact that it is the eastern ter-
I . vl ww
if the Black sea and the Danube, which
. f it crosses at Tchernavoda. Thence
f I.' the railroad runs westward into old
(i r Rumania.
J ' Von Mackensen's new campaign in
i Dobrudja was begun only last week,
f on October 19, when an offensive
! :- along the entire line from the Black
! I sea to the Danube was opened. The
WlT earlier effort of the field marshal was
started soon after Rumania's entrance
into the war. It Avas notably success
ful in its sweep down the Danube, re
sulting In the capture of the fortress
j of Turtukal on September S and of
V Salistria a few days later, but came
mi to a halt on September 28 when the
I ' Rumanians announced a defeat of the
ft : forces of the central powers well to
Ufl the south of the Constanza-Tchernavoda
line.
The opposing armies stood dead-
locked here for several weeks, while
the Teutonic offensive under General
von Falkenhayn in Transylvania was
,f opened and the Rumanians were driv
en back to their northern frontier
passes. The pressure from tho south
t was then renewed and apparently
i without a check of any account, Von
f Mackensen's armies have forced their
i way northward toward the railroad
' line, finally reaching It on its eastern
end at Constanza.
' v Constanza has been notably useful
in offering a seaport and railway cn
1 trance for Russian troops and ammu
nition sent to the aid of Rumania. Its
capture cuts off the most convenient
; water route for Rumanian replenlsh
i ment, especially In munitions of
which the Rumanians havo been re
' ported badly in need. Possession of
kJ entire line would give the Tou-
mm' tonic allies the easiest road to interior
rf&m Rumania from the southeast, over the

BRITISH GAIN
1 M SOMME
Capture 30,000 Prisoners,
Many Big Guns, French Mor

DRIVE BACK GERMANS
Morale of Army Improves
After Two Years of Prepa
ration and Stalling.
(Copyright, 1916, by the Associated
Press.)
British Front in Fronce, Oct. 23,
via London. More than three and
one-half months of battlo on tho
Somme, with the heaviest concentra
tion of artillery, infantry and every
type of war material, and the most
skilful and desperate fighting the
world has ever known, has resulted
in marked development of British
fighting efficiency and of means for
reducing tho losses of the attackers.
In the way of concrete achievements
the British have taken 30,000 prison
ers, or a little less than 1,500 for each
of tho 21 villages captured, with an
average population of about 300 souls.
They have taken 125 guns, 109 trench
mortars and trench guns and 429 ma
chine guns. They havo not lost a
gun.
The British have driven back the
Germans on a front of 11 miles, to a
depth of four to eight miles. Former
citizens of captured villages aro re
questing that they be allowed to re
turn to them and build new homes on
the ruins of their old ones.
Heavy British Casualties.
The offensive has consisted of In
tervals of preparation and siege work,
after each big general attack, to pre
pare what is called a "Jumping off"
place for another general attack.
Through July, owing to tho heavy cost
of taking the first line trenches, the
British casualties probably were heav
ier than tho German. Through Aug
ust, when over a largo part of the
front tho Germans were out of their
second as well as their first line sys
tem of defenses, and the battle be
came one of digging and fighting in
the open for both sides, casualties
were about oven. Yet from all infor-'
mation the correspondent can gain,
the German losses were not less than
25 per cent and possibly 50 per cent
higher than tho British during Sep
tember, when the British gained most
ground.
Superior Shell Fire.
This is due, according to tho Brit
ish officers, to the superior power of
the British shell fire, the numbers of
British aeroplanes, the Increased skill
of the British soldiers, and tho use of
the tanks. The British staff did not
placo much reliance on these new con
trivances. They aro only one of the
inventions aiding the offensive
against modern fortifications which
will be used next spring when tho
British are fully prepared. Calcula
tions as to the value of tho tanks are
hard to make, but, taking the averago
opinion of experts at the front, these
weird motor cars havo saved a loss of
20,000 men in tho reduction of strong
points and machine gun positions.
Tho offensive at every Btep proved
that no army can havo too many guns
which will kill and demoralize an en
omy with projectiles fired from a dis
tance of anywhere from 2,000 to 20,
000 yards. The great value has also
been proved of portable machine
guns. Men posted in shell craters
with these weapons have a forroidablo
power whether their sido is acting on
tho defensive or offensive.
Morale of Army.
Not in ground gained or prisoners or
guns taken, does opinion at the front
lay emphasis after nearly four
months' ceaseless fighting, overy day
bringing its lesson. Officers are al
ways using the word moralo, which
means the spirit and team play an
army puts into its work. The British,
after nearly two years of stalling, i
have been fighting week after week
on soil taken from thoir foe. Thus
the British morale has become the
morale of attack. This offensive has
, been tho school of war with death aa
tutor. By fighting, the British now
army learned to fight as Grant's army
learned to fight at Shiloh and McClel
lan's on the peninsula.
Before tho grand offensive the Brit
ish staff and commanders, those few
professionals who were trained to di
rect the regular army, realized fully
their immenso responsibility in build
ing an army trained In theory against
tho experienced German organization.
"We havo met the German staff,"
said a commander to the correspond
ent recently, "and I assure you none
of us are suffering from stage fright
these days. Wo thank the German
staff for what they taught us in the
days of our unpreparedness and of
late they have been learning a few
things from us."
Young Men Leading.
Actual battle conditions have re
vealed, as no theoretical tests could,
which officers are fit to lead. The
route to promotion has become suc
cess in action. In general thirties and
forties are now directing the fighting
in the field and battalion commanders
who are not yet thirty have ceased to
bo uncommon.
The taking of Thiepval was tho
most important of the capture of any
village because it was part of that re
doubtable flrot lino where the British
failed to break through on July 1. But
the hardest fighting was at such
places as Gulllemont, Delville and
Highwoods and at Pozieres and Mo
quet farm, where the struggle lasted
for weeks to gain tho coveted ridge
which is now entirely in British pos
session. But the British officers think
only of the experience gained for the
future and keep repeating that word
morale.
Will Fight to Death. V
A wounded British soldier sitting
beside the road recently, said to the
correspondent:
"Maybe the time will come when
only one Britisher and one German
will bo loft alive. If so, the Briton
will be on top."
This is what the officers mean by
morale.
