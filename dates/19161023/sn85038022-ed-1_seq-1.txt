ganlcatlnn for the coining year. A
good aaaociatlon waa had in that dla
trlct three years ago but It has not
Iteen reorganlied until the day men
tioned. Addreaaea by Mra. James Itoaa and
Prof. W. J. Capllnger opened MM

needs of such an organization and
aaked that one be organized at Hi '

! to be held on Friday of thia week.
Seventeen persons allied tiMtntWhTM
for Um Association.
Some talk was then heard of con
colidating all of the F'arent-Tcacher
Associations Into one body for the
purpose of studying High School prob
lems alone. Each body would he abl"
to meet at Its own building us often
ns possible to study conditions of tbht
particular building and once a month
meet in the central building and con
sider Um problems of the HIkIi School
This would be a good move on tuo
part of the various organizations In
the city and would be a great help to
that department of the schorls It N
hoped that this can be carried out.

aallafled with the result of the general
registration earlier in the month,
nnlizi- Unit the more who registered
means tho more who vote.
The apeclal registration next Mon
I'iiy, Tuesday ami Wednesday, will be
kM iii the county clerk's office at the
courthouse. Three classes of voters
an eligible to register at the spe
cial regiatration. They are those who
were necessarily absent from the city
or, the general registration day; those
who were unable to register because
(hey Vert ill. or those who were un
able to relator because of illness of
KM member of their family. Other
from these three causes none will be
accepted by ihe county clerk. Young
men who were 21 years old after the
general registration day, but befon
election day, should have registered
earlier In the month, and unless kept
IWI from the polls beeuuse of on',
of the above reasons, will not bo al
lowed to register or vsto,
i
Tho man who w ishes to register i
next week, must miko kJMarlt to the
county clerk, before he Is allowed t I
register, that he was kept away from
tiki polls on the general regiatration
day, because of absence from the cltv. !
illness to himself or Illness of some
member of his fumily. One challenger
from each party will be present and
can challenge the affidavit of any man
Slinulil this he done, and the voter
still Insists that he should be allowee
10 register under the spfclul reglstra-1
tion law, the challenger la then forced!
to get the affidavits of not less than i
two people, that the statement of the
man wishing to register Is untrue.
The county clerk then has the sol"
t'U'ht to decide whether the man i
sliimltl or should not register. How
ever, either party has the right, after
the decision of tho county clerk, to ap
peal to the court for a final decision in
Ita matter.
