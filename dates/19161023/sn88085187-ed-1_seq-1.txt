GEORGE TURNER—JUST A POLITICIAN!
George Turner, democratic nominee for V. S. senator,
catM here Saturday night to (ell Taeomans why, in his
opinion, lie should succeed Miles Poindexter.
Sen. Paindexter has served six years in the senate and
two in the house. He has cast votes on all important
measures. They were consistently tor the public welfare
—so much so that even Sen. Turner dares not criticise
SPECIFICALLY a single vote.
The Times judges men by their records, not by their
words.
Four years ago, The Times got a "close-up" view of
Cieorge Turner in action, and the impression thus gained
was that Turner is JUST A POLITICIAN. That was
during the state democratic convention in kjij at Walla

A great principle was involved at that convention. If

GETS WARRANTS
After a long session Saturday
afternoon at police headquarters
between Commissioner Pettit, Po-
lice Chief Harry M. Smith and
Prosecutor Remann, it was an
nounced that Police Chief Smith
had obtained a large batch of
blank search warrants, signed by
justices of the peace and approv
ed by Remann.
These warrants can be used on
any occasion by filling in the pro
per dates and addresses of re
sorts to be searched.
In this manner, the police fan
conduct raids without appealing
to tlio prosecutor in each case.
Police Chief Smith and Com
missioiier I'ettit admit that tli«y
obtained these warrants in order
to prevent further allied "tip
offs" of raids from the court
house.
"Keinnnn has promised that lie
would co-operate in every way
with the police department," an
nounced Commissioner Pettit.
"That Is all we as*. If we use
blank search warrants for our
raids, and 'tip-offn' still continue,
we will know that someone In
the police department is respon
sible, and can art accordingly.
"Kemann is personally not to
blame for the things that have
ocrurred. Some of the men under
him have not been playing fair
with him.
"The prosecuting attorney is
'wise' now to the way his em
ployes have been double-crossing
him."

Sphiiix!"
Atalented young Japanese art
ist, kanaka, has brought a con
troversial whirlwind about Ills
heacl because of this outß])oken
Oriental fancy.
It etarted with a public exhibi
tion .here of "The Blue Cat," a
portrait of an American woman
into. which the Japanese had
painted his conception of feline
femipinitv.
Now the discussion threatens
to s-fread to art circles every
where.
"Beautiful, attractive women,"
Maintains this bronzed Bernard
Shaw of the Orient," always have
tbe (jat-Uke quality of feature and
•plrlf.
'"Hie face of the woman I por
trayed in the 'Blue Cat' suggests
that ,of a baby tiger. The width
of cheekbones, the nervous qual
ity off the brows and the expres
sion .of the eyes is distinctly fe
line. 1 This physical structure Is
peculiarly attractive to me, as an
artist, anil I believe it is to all
men. It suggests reserve energy;
hidden fires!
. "WJierever the cattish quality
le found in women there is sure
to ha some powerful lure of per
sonality."
1 Many Seattle club women,
4rltics and art patrons, were
jfiocked at Tanaka's conception.
Tht>y have taken his characteriza
tion of women as seriously as he
professed to hold It.
"No man with any reverence
for women could possibly compare
them to cats," contended Dr.
Mary Green Korated, prominent
In the Women's Century club.
"Tanuka's unjustified fancy
suggests derision," added Mrs.
Frank Houghton, another well
known clubwoman.
Tbe Japanese painter, however,
vigorously refutes such imputa
tion.
"The fact that alluring women
seem to me to have cattisli qual
ities," he explained, "does not de
tract from my reverence for them.
I do not mean to say they are
scratcy 'spitfires.' 1 am, on the
contrary, paying them a high trib
ure by comparing them to cats."
P. Tadania, under whom Tana
ka studied, refused to tako the
"Ulue Cat" controversy seriously.
"Tanaka," he laughed, "likes a
sensation. Why, he once painted
what he was pleased to call 'The
Smell of a Norwegian Cheese!'
"He called this picture, 'The
Blue Cat' because he knew it
would make the women kick."

Then, growing demagogic lie declares'
