Asssssin Adler Alone in His Attempt
to Avenge Imaginary Wrong—-Mur
der to Have No Effect on Conduct of
War—Father of Adler Condemns
Deed of Son—Belonged to Radical
Socialistic Element.
Vienna, Oct, 23.—Government circles
here regard the killing of Premier
iStuergkh as an act of a political crank,
which can in no wise influence the po
litical situation or the course of the
war. This statement was made to the
correspondent of the Associated Press
in high responsible quarters.
It is pointed out that the time which
has elapsed since the murder has shown
that Adler, the assassin, stands alone.
His act is disavowed by the socialist
party and press and condemned by his
father, Victor Adler, socialist member
of the lower chamber of thev reichsrath.
Adler stated to the police that he shot
Stuergkh because the pre.mier opposed
the convening of parliament. It is
stated officially that -Stuergkh had at
no time done this and that he could
not do it because the convening of
parliament was a matter in the hands
of the political parties.
The Vienna press brands Adler as a
vile, irresponsible criminal and without
exception deplores the fact that the act
of-a craz man should disturb the peace
of the city.
DEED OF FANATIC.
No Political Significance Attached to
Auaaaination .of Premier.
Vienna, Oct. 22, via London, Oct. 23.—
Dr. Friedrich Adler, the iwsassin of the
Austrian premier, Count-Karl Stuergkh.
is being held by the pollce awaiting
trial. He maintains his composure.
The population of Vienna is recovering
from the shock of the assassination.
The assassin Is known as^L very
Insane asylum as well as a sfster. H6
has long been troubled with heart dis
ease. Altho only 37 years old he glyes
the ltopresslon of being an aged man.
'He' has two children. His wife is an
invalid.
After studying chemistry and work
ing several years as a chemist, Adler
went to Switzerland. He returned to
Austria shortly before the war, Imbued
with the extreme M'arxiian theories,
which he advanced in a periodical
called Das Volk. This- paper ceased
publication at the outbreak of the war.
Subsequently Dr. Adler founded Der
Kampf, in which he treated social
problems In an able, scientific manner.
Unknown Jto Premier.
The assassination was not political,
since Dr. Adler was entirely unknown
to the premier. He recently desired
the socialists to take certain action
against the premier, but his proposal
was viewed unfavorably by the party.
He oontinued publication of Der
Kampf and shunned all society. Bei
ing Independently wealthy, 'he was able
to follow such a course.
Count Stuergkh was little known to
the Austrian public until he became,
premier. He was of a retiring dis
position. His tenure of oilice brought
him no great chances, tho some were
expected when he took the office.
Thus far it is unknown Who wlil
succeed bhe murdered man, but neither
the attitude of the government nor the
course of the war will be influenced by
Dr. Adler's act.
As Viewed irr-Germany.
Berlin, via London, Oct. 23.—All ac
counts in the morning papers agree in
calling the assassination of Premier
Stuergkh. of Austria, the .deed of an
irresponsible political fanatic, whose
mind has given away under strain of
'the war. The Vorwaerts, which ex
presses the strongest disapproval of
Dr. Adler's deed, declares he was un
doubtedly demented wfhen he com*'
mttted the murder, as nobody in his
senses could have expected favorable
result from such an act.
The premier's last political act was
to prohibit twt big meetings called for
today as demonstrations in favor of
the convocation of parliament. He
'also^designated on the part of the gov
ernment delegates to participate in a
"conference tomorrow to discuss the
possibility of a resumption of the
sitting of the deflitles.
There* Is no disposition to oharge
'Adler's act to "the parties which de
manded the reconvening of the diet.
ASSASSINATION POLITICAL.
Murder of Austrian Premier Dus to
Refusal to Reconvene Psrliamsnt.
Vienna, Oct. 23.—The assassination
of Austrian Premier Count, Karl
Stuergkh, was purely political and was

DISPUTES GOMPERS' CLAIMS.
Former Head of Carpenter* Charged A.
F. L. Chief Misrepresented Hughes.
Chicago, Oct. 23.—An attack on Sam
uel Gompers aria his ai^g for a circular
sent to southern trades unionists pur
porting to give the labor record of
Charies E .Hughes by John Wiiiiams,
former president of the United Brother
hood of Carpenters and Joiners of
America, was made public yesterday by
John A. Metz, president of the carpen
ters 'council of Cook county.
Mr. Metz wrote Mr. Williams, who
was labor commissioner of New York
when Hughes was governor, for a de
tailed statement of the circular sent out
by Mr. Gompers. Mr. Williams' reply
carries the flat charge that Mr. Gom
pers and his aids deliberately misrep
resented Hughes' record.
Mr. Metz last night declared he stood
ready to back up Mr. Williams and to
add his protest to the campaign circu
lars being distributed by Mr. Gompers.
"They are unfair to Mr. Hughes," said
Mr. Metz. "The only square thing to
do is to give Mr. Hughes' full record
while governor of New York and Mr.
Wilson's full record. This, Mr. Gom
pers has failed to do."
'It was thfe-solemn duty of the labor
representation committee of the Amer
ican Federation of Labor," says Mr.
Williams In his letter, "to have fur
uished a complete and Impartial state
ment'of the" records of both candi
dates.
"The committee had no moral right
to suppress that part of President Wil
son's record which was Inimical to thu
Interests of labor.
"Not on© word was said, however, in
regard to those measures advocated by
organised'liab&r,'among them the vitally
Important Immigration bill, which were
criticised pr vetoed by the president.

British Front in France, via London,
Oct. 23. 'More than three and one-half
months of battle on the Somme, with
the heaviest concentration of artillery,
infantry and every type of war ma
terial and the most skillful and des
perate fighting the world has ever
known, has resulted in marked de
velopment of British military effi
ciency. In the way of concrete achieve
ment the British have taken 30,000
prisoners, or a little less than 2,100 for
each of the villages captured. They
have taken loi guns, many moi
t"™ and trench guns and 420 machine
guns. They have not lost a gun. The
Lritish have driven back the Germans
or. a front of eleven miles, to a depth
of four to eight miles.
Former citizens of captured villages
are requesting they be allowed to re
turn and build new homes.
The offensive has consisted of In
tervals of siege work preparatory to
a big attack.
Thru July, owing to the heavy cost
of taking the first line trenches, the
British casunlties probably

Thru An
Death Tutor in School of War.
The British, after nearly two years
of stalling, have been fighting week
after week on soil taken from their
foe. Thus the British morale has be
come the morale of attack. This of
fensive lias been the school of war,
with death as tutor. By fighting, the
British army learned to fight as
Hrant's army learned to fight at
Shlloh and iMoC'lellan's on the penin
sula.
Beforo tho grand offensive the
British staff and commanders, those
few professionals who were trained to
direct thV» regular army, realized fully
their immense responsibility In send
ing an army trained in theory against
the superior German hrganlzntion.
Learn From Germans.
"We have met the German staff."
said a commander recently, "and as
sure you none of us are suffering from
singe fright these days. We thank the
Oerman staff for what they taught us,
and of late they have been learning a
few things from us. Actual battle
conditions have revealed as no theoreti
cal tests could which officers are fit to
Ii-au. Tilt- route t« promotion has be
come success in action. Generals from
30 to 40 direct the fighting in the field
and battalion commnnders who have
not yet become 30 have ceased to be
uncommon."

Yet, from all information the corre

during September, when the British
gained most ground.

This is due. according to the British
officers, to the superior power of the
British shell Are, the number of British
aeroplanes, the increased skill pt th®
British soldiers and the u*e of "tanks."
The British staff did not place much
reliance on these naw contfivances. 13^'Xe

fications which will be used next
spring, when the British are fully pre
pared. Calculations as to the value of
the tanks are hard to make, but tak
ing the average opinion of experts at
the front these weird motor cars have
'paved a loss of 20,000 men In the re
duction of strong points and machine
gun positions.
The capture of Thlepval was one of
the sreatrsi achievements. The hard
est fighting was at such places as
Cuillemont, Delvllle and Hlghwoods t-l
and at Pozieres and at Moquette farm.
where the struggle lasted for weeks
to gain tho coveted ridge which is now
entirely in British possession. But
the British officers think only ot the
experience gained for the future. A
wounded British soldier said recently:
"Maybe the time will come when .•
only one British soldier and one Ger
man will remain, and if^so the ijr
"PriHsher will boon top."
This is what the British officer
meant as morale.
