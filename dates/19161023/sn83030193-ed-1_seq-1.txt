Head of One of Largest Distribut
ing Concerns Indorses Evening
World's Proposal for Control by a
State or Municipal Commission.
The suggestion of The Evening World that the business of distrihit
ing milk is as much in the line of public service ns transporting passsen
Rers on a railroad, or the distribution of gas and electricity, or the main
tenance of a telephone system, and should be regulated by a State or
Municipal Commission, 'has been indorsed as sound by Raymond Ii.
Van Cise, President of the Mutual-McDcrmott Dairy Company.
Mr. Van Cbjij Ih of tho opinion that
lie only way to avoid duplication In
milk distribution Ik to place tho dis
tribution under Btato control, lie

"Tlio milk business should bo ro-

moved from a competitive basis. It Is I
us much a public acrvlco ontorprlso
as transit lines, gas companies and
electric lighting plantn. Therefore it
should be renulated by a public of
ficial or by the Public Servico Com
mission. "In this way consumors enn be
ussurcd of their milk, for It can bo
seen that the business bo kept suf
ficiently attractive to encourago tho
Investment of capital."
Mr. Van Clse said ho Is eons'.dorlng
t no proposition or selling milk at a
eduction of 2 cents a quart to thoso
who call for It at tho distributing tn.,
tlons and carry It away.
A bettor wny of milk distribution, In
lis opinion, would bo dividing tho city
Into districts by State regulation and
turning: over tho distribution In each
district to ono distributor, thus doing' 10 cents a hundred pounds or forty

Association.
A signed application blank sent to Tlie Kvonlns World will bring the

Tbo first effort of this new association Is a thorough study of the milk
situation. Kvery authoritative sourro found bearing on tho subject will
be studied, and every angle of the Industry will b thoroughly examined.
In Saturday's Issue the Housewives' Protective Association ralced tlio

CLEVELAND, Oct. I3. The prac
tlcal certainty that the Chicago
steamer Nerida was I jut In Friday's
groat storm on Lako Erie ntid that
her crow of twenty-ilvo were drowned
brings tho total of known dead in tho
storm nbovo llfty, und arouses tho
fear that sixty or moro lives were
sacrificed, for whllo tho loss of only
four steamers has positively been re
ported .ovoral aro missing and greac
plies of wreckage nio piling up along
tho lako aboro at wliUly Keparnled
points.
Last Friday's gain was tho worst
since November, l'J13, when tovonty
vessels went down on the Ureal Ikkes
most of thorn dia.tll steamers und

The steamer Matthews, Capt, Cun
ningham, brought Into Toledo to-day
tho bodies of four men wearing life
belts from tho Nerida. Capt. Cun
ningham reports that tho fn ighter
Charlotte C. Urcltung also picked up
four ladles believed to havo been
those of members of tho crow of tho
Nerida and took them to Sandwich,
Ontario.
Two of the four bodies wero Iden
tified at the Windsor, Ont morgue
ns members of the Merlda's crew.
The men wero Anton Zimmerman of
llrooklyn, a coal paster, and William

The steamer llrlton, the last to
night tho Nerida afloat, reached Uuf
falo to-day with her upper works
badly shattered nnd her rails and bul
warks forward carried away and
three feet of w.iter In her engine
room. Capt. Massy of the llrlton
says that the Nerida. when he saw
her, was taking every sea that came
clear across her decks and appeared
to be beyond control.
Capt. Matty and his ctew had all j
they could do to save their own ves
sel and had to head Into tho storm
and leave the Nerida to her fate.
It Is well ettabllfhed that Capt,
Walter (Ir.ishaw, who was brought
Into Conneatit yesterday after being
picked up on a lifeboat In the 'middle
