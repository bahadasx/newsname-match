Wilson ami Washington.
-President Wilson's positions and
actions have been entirely justifiable
from the standpoint of those who
justify the positions and actions of
President Buchanan. But it is utterly
impossible to deftnd the conduct of
President Wilson, save by inferential!

.ient us Wash i net on. Jackson and
i i., in if President Wilson's
havior toward Germany and especially
toward Mexico, if his attitude in both
our international and internal affairs
are proper, then Washington, Jackson
and Lincoln acted improperly in up
holding and savins the Union and de
fending our position against foreign
nations by their readiness and ability
to use force. If their attitude toward
the army and navy was rigjit, then t:ie
iittituile of Mr. Wilson in ippjinting
and maintaining Mr. Daniils as sec
retin v nt the navy, and Mr. Baker as
KW-c'nry of war, is wholly unde
fendable .VI , ,
Mr Baker is an amiable pacifist
who. I do not doubt, could render
service along other lines, but he is ex
nuisitelv unfit for his present position,
rind would never have been appointed
to it if Mr. Wilson had been willing
to look at the army from the stand
point of military efficiency, instead
of creating it purely from the stand
point of temporary protective expedi-
ein:y.
iirimriiiicv- t ..... ..... . .
"Mr. Baker has been engaged re- .
cently on several occasions in the de
fpMse of Mr. Wilson. His effort is to
ilefv-nd Mr. Wilson's attitude toward
Carranza and the Mexican bandits
generally by alleging that Washington
unci his soldiers stood on substantially
the same level. He is by r.o means
as astute as Mr. Wilson, but he is
more sincere and straightforward.
"When he was appointed to the
position of secretary of war the news
papers reported him as saying that he
'knew nothing about the army that he
was a pacifist and that even when a
boy his principles had been such that
he never played with tin soldiers.

Just What Baker Said.
"The New York Tribune made a
stenographic report of the speech of
Mr. Haker at Jersey City on October
16. This speech by an American sec
retary of war representing the Ameri
can president had at least the merit
of presenting a wholly novel view of
the founders of this republic.
"The speech runs in part: 'Some
people say they cannot understand the
president's Mexican policy and I want
to tell you why. They have forgot
ten our own history and the Declara
tion of Independence and the presi
dent has not forgotten either. Why
are we 1 .patient with Mexico? We
say they do not respect the lives and
property of our people.- Perhaps they
don't. We say they do not pay their
honest debts. We say they are a raga
muffin lot; we say their money is not
any good; that's true, it is not worth
two or thrvv. cents on a dollar. We
say they do not respect church prop
erty. That also is true. The amazing
thing is that people never respect
these things in a revolution.
" 'We had a revolution and from
the beginning to the end of that the
conditions in this country were so like
Mexico that it is perfectly astounding
to read. Washington's army was in
rags, and they stole, they stole the sil
ver vessels from the churches and
melted them up to buy things to eat.
They drove ministers of the gospels
and preachers out of the churches and
ut of the country. The president is
in favor of letting the fourteen mil-
lion people in Meyico who had not had

at 11 o'clock last night in an alley

and the golden rule."
"The final touch about the golden
rule," said the colonel, "applied in
pnmiMrinz men who rape women,
murder childern and torture wounded
soldiers, to the signers of the Declara-
rtn nf Tndenen dence and the singular
Iv humane soldiers of Washington adds
an element of nauseous hyprocisy to
as preposterous and ridiculous slan
der as ever was circulated about the
men of the Revolution. I have no
doubt whatever that in this astound
ing statement Mr. Baker gives Mr.
Wilson's real views, exactly as Mr.
Lansing, in his famous note of June
last, incautiously told the exact truth
about the acts of Carranza and the
Mexican bandits generally.
Calls It Desecration.
"Mr Wilson's attitude toward Car
ranza can not possibly be Justified ex
cept in theory that at the bottom of
his hear! he looks upon all soldiers as
equally bad, and has no conception
that Washington and Carranza stand
in opposite planes of moral and po
litical scale.
"Of course, from the standpoint of
patriotism, from the standpoint of any
American citizen proud of his country
and his army, it is profoundly unpa
triotic, profoundly dishonorable, it in
deed, amounts almost to desecration
to compare Washington's army, the
men of Valley Force, who sacrificed
everything for their country, and
snowed singular numamty with the
herd of bloodthirsty bandits who, now
under one bandit leader, now under
another, ravaged Mexico and whom
the president has been backing and
Buoporting in their murders and out
( rages for the last three and. a half
i years in Mexico.
"The man who professed such doc
trmes is wholly unfit to stay in the
cabinet and the president who retains
him is wholly unfit to remain the
president of the United States.
Silence Is Acquiescence.
"This statement of Mr. Baker's ac
quiesced in by the silence of Mr. Wil-
j son, says that Mr. Wilson, in his heart,
ueiievea men wttsiiuigiuil vtas no Bel
ter than Villa or Carranza; that the
men of the revolution stood on a level
with the miscreant crew, who during
the last three and a half years in
Mexico have murdered Americans by
the hundreds and Mexicans by the
tens of thousands.
"These men have perpetrated every
species of outrage upon women and
children and have turned all Mexico
into a hell of starvation, disease and
misery. They have done this with ac
tive or passive assistance of the Amer
ican government under lead of Mr.
Wilson and Mr. Wilson's cabinet offi
cer now defends them by the foulest
slander on the men who made us a
nation."

DO WE GET MORE GAS?
Case to Be Transferred From K. C. to
State House Maybe.
If the public utilities commission
performs in accordance with Its
schedule, Inning No. 947 of the gas
case will be played in the state house
Tuesday. The commission has listed
the investigation of the new gas rate
schedule for Tuesday's entertainment.
One frame of the gas case is being
played today in Kansas City. That
fact, itnvas asserted, might occasion a
delay in the rate investigation. Un
less the federal Judges upset plans,
however, the gas case will be called on
time. The investigation concerns the
new gas rate schedule and it is prob
able the controversy will open the old
case, while consumers read the pro
ceedings as they sit beside cold gas
ranges and pay higher rates as they
listen to the hum of the meters.

DEFENDERS' ROUT DISASTROUS
Teutons' Biggest Objective in
Dobrudja Campaign
Cuts Off Nation From Supplies
by Sea From Russia.
Berlin, Oct. 23. Constanza, Ru
mania's greatest teaport, has fallen
before Field Marshal " Mackensen's
armies, it was officially announced
this afternoon. Capture of the city is
the greatest single achievement for the
Central Powers since Rumania entered
the war eight weeks ago. The capture
is looked upon by German military
critics as of more importance than any
of the gains of the allies.
Official dispatches from the German
and Bulgarian war office indicate that
the Russo-Rumanlans have suffered a
disastrous rout.
Smashing northward along the
Black sea coast, Mackensen's armies
occupied first the Rumanian port of
Tuzla and then swept onward thru
strongly fortified Rumanian lines of
defense, marching twelve miles to
Constanza in a little more than two
days.
Retreat Demoralized.
The rapidity of the Teuton ad
vance is accepted as an indication
that the Russians and Rumanians be
came demoralized and made an ex
tremely disordered retreat. An offi
cial statement from Sofia earlier in the
day, reporting the capture of a village
six miles south of Constanza. prepared
Berlin for news of a great victory.
Troops of the central powers have
crossed the railway line running be
tween the Black sea port of Constanza
and the River Danube at a point to
the east of Murfattar, the official an
nouncement says. The fortress of
Constanza was taken by German and
Bulgarian troops.
On the left wing of Field Marshal
von Mackensen's army, the statement
adds, the Germans and their allies are
approaching the Danube town of
Tchernavoda. - -
Principal Railroad Center.
Constanza is one of the principal
objectives of Field Marshal von Mack
ensen in his campaign in Dobrudja. It
is of particular importance by reason
of the fact that it is the eastern
terminus of the only railroad between
the Black sea and the Danube, which
it crosses at Tchernavoda. Thence
the railroad runs westward into old
Rumania.
Von Mackensen's new campaign in
Dobrudja was begun only last week,
on October 19, when an offensive
along the entire line from the Black
sea to the Danube was opened. The
earlier effort of the field marshal was
started soon after Rumania's entrance
into the war. It was notably success
ful in Its swoop down the Danube,
resulting in the capture of the fortress
of Turtukai on Septmber 8, and of
Silistria a few days later, but came to
a halt on September 28, when the Ru
manians announced a defeat of the
forces of the central powers Well to
the south of the Constanza-Tcherna-voda
line.
The opposing armies stood dead
locked here for several weeks while
the Teutonic offensive under 'General
von Falkenhayn, in Transylvania was
opened and the Rumanians were driv
en back to their northern frontier
passes. The pressure from the south
was then renewed and apparently
without a check of any account, Von
Mackensen's armies have forced their
way northward towards the railroad
line, finally reaching it on its easter
ly end at Constanza.
Cut Off Ammunition Supplies.
Constanza has been notably useful
Its capture cuts off the most conven
ient water route for Rumanian re
plenishment, especially in munitions,
of which the Rumanians have been re
ported badly in need. . Possession of
the entire line would give the Teutonic
allies the easiest road to interior Ru
mania from the southeast over the
Tchernavoda bridge.
Constanza is Rumania's greatest
maritime port and its harbor works
have been extensively developed. The
city was partially rebuilt when Dob
rudja was ceded to Rumania in 1878.
It has been the base of the Rumanian
black sea squadron. The city before
the war had a population of about
13,000.
STRUCK A DESTROYER
German Flyer Drops Bomb on British
Boat During Raid.
Berlin. Oct. 23. A British destroy
er off Flanders coast was struck by
a bomb from a German aeroplane
Saturday, the admiralty announced to
day. The statements follows:

withstanding heavy shelling, all the

William Hall Jenkins, for many
years a resident of Topeka and at one
time a wealthy abstracter in this city,
was found dead this morning in the
office of W. I. Jamison. His death,
which is thought to have occurred
Sunday, was caused by heart failure.
Jenkins was sixty-four years old.
William 'H. Jenkins came here forty

money and died in poverty. He was
well known to all the earlier residents
of Topeka.
Mr. Jenkins is survived by a son,
Paul Jenkins, an employe on a Union
Pacific train between Kansas City and
Denver, and a, daughter, -in Maryland.
Coroner O. P. Marcotte was called,
but it was decided no inquest was

three of them from the foundered
steamer Merida, and a report that four
other bodies of this ill-fated boat had

of the Merida's crew unac
counted for.
The report of Capt. Alexander Mc
Donald of the Harvey Goulder that
he had found the lake "full of wreck
age, which- he could not identify."
1 caused the fear that other steamers as
yet unreported, may have foundered
with loss of life.

ACCEPTNEW DUTY
Social Service Dep't Founded by
Episcopal Church.
Perceives Sense of Social Re
sponsibility for "Masses."
St. Louis, Oct. 23. Announcement
of the appointment of a standing so
cial service committee headed by the
Rt. Rev. Edwin S. Lines, bishop of
Newark, N. J., was made today from
the house of bishops of the Protestant
Episcopal general convention in ses
sion here. The committee will co
operate with a similar commission of
the house of deputies, the lower body
of the convention. The appointment
according to leaders of tho church in
effect marks the approval of the up
per house, "or tne sense or social re
sponsibility and social sympathy.
which has manifested itselt at this
convention."
This vear, for the first time the
Right Rev. Paul Jones, bishop of
Utah, and a member of the newly
created committee, pointed out today,
the convention has held a daily social
forum, at which the attitude of the
church towards the social welfare of
'the masses' ' has been openly dis
cussed.
Last Week of Convention.
Today, the beginning of the finoi
week of the convention, discussion
centered on proposals to change the
method or representation In the house
of deputies. The Rev. R. H. McKim
of Washington, urged that the present
system providing equi:! representation
from each diocese be discarded and a
plan be adopted giving the church
units representation in proportion to
the number of the communicants.
The house of bishops, according lo
an announcement made several uavg
ago. today will debate upon a proposal
to open tneir sessions to the public.
Since the first triennial convention, in
Philadelphia in1789, the meetings of
the upper house have been held be
hind closed doors and it is expected
the proposal will meet with spirited
resistance.

Hearing Convenes Today.
STATE AGAIN CAUSES DELAY
Call 125 Witnesses to Testify
Against SIcDaniel.
Doubt if Case Can Be Complet
ed by Election Day.
St. Joe, Oct. 23. The trial of Oscar
D. McDaniel. prosecuting attorney of
Buchanan county, charged with the
murder of his wife, was gotten under
way In the criminal court here this
afternoon. The selection of the Jury
was begun before Judge Thomas F.
Ryan at once.
Shortly after the trial was openea.
L. A. Vories and Judge R. E. Culver,
attorneys, who had volunteered to aul
Mr. Lockwood in the prosecution, an
nounced they had withdrawn from the
state's side of the trial. Mr. Vories
declared to Judge Ryan that he and
Judge Culver had offered their serv
ices because Mr. Lockwood had been
handling the case without assistance.
Their withdrawal left only Mr. Barker
and Mr. Lockwood on the prosecu
tion's side of the table.
St. Joe. Mo.. Oct. 23. John T. Bark
er, attorney general of Missouri, in
structed by Governor Major to aid. in
the trial of Oscar D. McDaniel, prose
cuting attorney of Buchanan county,
charged with the murder of his wife,
obtained a continuance until this aft
ernoon when the case against Prose
cutor McDaniel was resumed before
Judge Thomas F. Ryan in the criminal
court here this morning.
Judge Ryan, In granting the con
tinuance indicated that no more con
tinuances would be granted and that
the trial would go ahead promptly
when court reconvened at 1 o'clock
this afternoon. The continuance was
strongly protested by attorneys for
McDaniel.
Hard to Find Witnesses.
A postponement was anticipated to
day in view of the failure of Bart M.
Lockwood, special prosecutor, to an
nounce whether several state's wit
nesses could be obtained to testify.
i Attorneys for the defense were expect
ed to insist upon going ahead, as Mr.
McDaniel, is a candidate for re-election
and has stated he wishes to have
a Jury decision before the November
election.
Judge Thomas F. Ryan before whom
the case will be tried, announced that
if necessary night sessions will be held
and that every effort would be made
to expedite the trial. Mr. McDaniel,
despite the coming trial has not dis
continued his campaign. Practically
every night since he was released on
bond of $50,000, he has addressed
political gatherings.
The case when called last week, was
put over until today because several
witnesses had not been subpoenaed
and to give several new attorneys for
the state time to become familiar with
it.
Complete Surprise to Defense.
The entry of Attorney General
Barker into the case was a complete
surprise to the defense as they had
had no intimation even of his presence
in St. Joseph. McDaniel, who had en
tered the crowded court room smiling
a few minutes before Mr. Barker's ap
pearance, met the announcement with
a frown. His attorneys Jumped to
their feet when the attorney general
asked Judge Ryan for permission to
speak.
"I have been asked by the governor
to aid in the prosecution of this case,"
the attorney said asking a continuance
until 1 o'clock in order to confer with
Bart M. Lockwood, special prosecutor.
"What assurances have we that this
trial will not be continued indefinite
ly.'" Judge C. F. Strop, head of the
defense, demanded.
"We are ready to go to trial."
"You may be assured there will be
no further continuance," Judge Ryan
replied.
The resumption of the trial, follow
ing the postponement granted last
week at the request of the state was
greeted by a crowded, court room, the
number of women present being al
most as great as that of the men. The

DEMOCRATS HERE
TO INVESTIGATE
EFFICIENCY IDEA
Senator Joseph in Topeka to
Probe State Conditions.
Thirty-Five Departments
Will
Come Under His Eye.
MATTER OF PATRIOTISM NOW
One Man Found "o Appropria
tion Became Disgusted.
Senator Lambertson Tried It
Joseph Will Act.
Kansas Democrats1 today an
nounced their intention of taking
look at the state efficiency plan
Senator J. D. Joseph of Butler county.
Democrat, came to Topeka today to
begin the work. The Butler county
senator will nose around state depart
ments for some time he announced
his intention of investigating soma
thirty-five state departments and h "
wilt make a report to the legislature,
such as his Democratic conscience,
dictates.
It was only a year or so ago that
Senator W. P. Lambertson of Fair
view, Republican, began work as an
efficiency expert. Of course most of
the state institutions were new to
Senator Lambertson. But he investi
gated Just the same. He went to the
institutions and state offices and after
standing around awhile asked a num
ber of questions. Some of the ques
tions were answered, too. In other
instances heads of departments rather
inferred that maybe Senator Lambert
son possessed a questionable working
knowledge of the things he sought to
investigate.
And now the Democrats are to try
it. Senator Joseph, aside from being
a Democrat, is a banker and a tele
phone man. He knows a good dea!
about the banking business and the
telephone game. As a member. of the
legislature he voted on the appropria
tion Dins lor state institutions and de
partments. So now he proposes to
open up the state house and see what
makes the wheels go round. He will
follow the course pursued by Senator
Lambertson and will call on the state
officers and ask some questions. He
will Jot down a lot of figures and then
he will return to his Whitewater bank
and write a report
It Is a Good Idem.
This efficiency idea goes well in a
campaign Democrat, Republican or
Socialist. It reads well in a state
platform. But the efficiency plan as
being tried in Kansas isn't a complete
success in the Judgment of institution
and department heads, in quiet, con
fidential manner, there are state of
ficials members of both parties who
are quite willing to admit they don't
like the plan. In short they don't un
derstand Just how-Senator Lambert
son or Senator Joseph or any other
legislative member can come to To
peka, prowl around a state otfice for a
few hours and suggest a plan for im
provement in the handling of the
state's business. For that reason there
will be no reception committee, no cut
flowers and no Hungarian orchestra to
meet Senator Joseph when he begin
his work as a member of the state
smelling committee.
The efficiency ci mmission was due
to an act of the last legiiOa'ure. Its
membership is Senators Lambertson
and Joseph and Representative Bur
ton. Lambertson and Burton are Re
publicans. Shortly after the commis
sion was created. Burton came to To
peka, looked over the field, found
there was no appropriation for th
work and went home disgusted. H
refused to work without pa;- even in
suggesting a saving for the dear tax
payers. But Senator Lambertson har
vested his alfalfa crop arly and
showed more patriotism. Now the
Democrats are not to be outdone. Sen
ator Joseph will look around the state
house a few weeks and he will ask a
long list of questions whether any
one answers them or not
