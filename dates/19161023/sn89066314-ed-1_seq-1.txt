BERLIN. Oct. 23. The Rumanian
seaport of Constanza has been cap
tured by Bulgarians, the official war
office statement announced today. Ru
mania's greatest seaport, fell before
Field Marshal Von Mackensen's ar
mies. The capture of the city is the great
est single achievement of the Central
Towers since Rumania entered the
war eight weeks ago. The victory is
held by German military men of more
importance than all the gains made by
the Allies since the beginning of the
Somme offensive.
Official dispatches from the Bulga
rian and German war offices indicate
that the Russo-Rumanians hae suffer
ed a disastrous rout.
Smashing northward along the
Black Sea, the Mackensen armies oc
cupied the Rumanian port of Tazla
only Saturday, and then swept on
ward through strongly fortified Ru
manian lines of defense, marching
tuehc miles to Constanza in little
more than two days.
Since Rumania entered the war
Russian transports have been bring
ing Slav troops, munitions and other
war supplies to aid the Rumanians.
Large bodies of Russian troops have
arrhed in Rumania through the port
of Constanza, whose capture by the
Central Powers effectually puts an
end to the transportation of reinforce
ments by the Black Sea.
The Constanza railway leading
across the Danube Is the carrier over

quantity of her supplies. The Teutonic
right wing is now commanding the
railway from Constanza, while Mack
ensen's center and left wing are
swinging forward to capture the re
mainder of the road. Mackensen is
aiming principally at Cernvoda and
the great bridge over the Danube.

History to Determine Date.
"The date of the celebration will be
determined by the following history,"
said Floyd Shoemaker, secretary of
the State Historical Society.
"Missouri became a state on Wed
nesday afternoon, July 19, 1820, but
the matter was not settled until Au
gust 10, 1821. The struggle began
in 1817, when the people of the ter
ritory petitioned for a statehood. One
of the original petitions is in the his
torical library. For three sessions of
Congress this question was of much
note in both houses. Heated debates
as to whether Missouri should be a
free or slave state were frequent In
1820 the Enabling Act, known as the
Missouri Compromise, was passed. In
June of that year Missourians held a
convention in St Louis, where forty-
one delegates framed a constitution.
Monday, August 28, 1820, Missouri
held its first state elecUon. We learn
from the old Missouri Intelligencer
that the election was well attended.
