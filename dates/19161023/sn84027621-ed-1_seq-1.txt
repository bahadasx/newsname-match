LEESBURG MASONS
FAVOR OCALA
(Leesburg Commercial) ,
Leesburg Masons are not going to
attempt to secure the home and or
phanage for this city. If Ocala were
not in the race they would make a
strong fight -for, it, but the Ocala
lodge of Masons is looked upon by the
Leesburg members of the order as an
older brother and the strength of this
lodge will be devoted to assisting
Ocala in securing the institution.
There is an unusual attachment be
tween these two lodges. On many oc
casions five to a dozen automobiles
have come from Ocala to Leesburg,
laden with Masons, to take part in
local Masonic affairs, social and fra
ternal. And there is rarely a meeting
of either lodge that some visitor from
the other is not present.

f.lEflT OF MACHINE GUtl SQUAD
(Special to
Laredo, Oct. 20. The machine gun
company of the Second Florida regi
ment received today from the arsenal
at San Antonio five Ford motor cars,
equipped with four Lewis, machine
guns, with 20,000 rounds of ammuni
tion. These guns fire 600 rounds a
minute. The Second Florida is very
much elated over their success in get
ting Henry's instead of ; the 'old-time
army mules. The Florida is the -only
regiment -equipped with motor trucks.
Monday night the Florida boys wit
nessed one of the hardest rain storms
theV ever saw. . The rain, came down
in, sheets, while lightning illuminated
the camp as if it. were day. . The next
day was spent ' grading streets and
digging ditches. When it rains, and
it has rained almost evepr other day
since we arrived, the streets are noth
ing but mud, not onlyf our camp
streets but Laredo's main thorough
fares as well ;,
: Wednesday was field inspection day
for the Second Florida. ; The boys
made a very creditable showing.
Thursday was our first hike. There
is only one way to hike here" and that
is over the wagon . road, north Vof
Laredo. The scenery is- not very
beautiful, all you see is 'cactus and
mesquite bushes.
Here is the way Mexicans catch fish
in the Rio Grande. All along the river
you can see Mexicans wading around
the river, driving down posts. Each
post has a bell attached to it and a
line running up to the Tiollse. When
ever the, ball rings a Mexican kid
runs down and takes the fish off. and
returns to await the ringing of the
bell again. - . ;" " '
If all Mexicans are in as bad a fix
as they are here they are in a critical
condition. Until there was a stop put
to it, it was a common sight to see
little Mexican girls, boys and old
women begging scraps from the boys
after each meal. C. G. ,W.
IN MEMORIAM
Members of the Woman's Club Pay a
Beautiful Tribute to their
Departed President
When a beautiful life has had its
earthly ending and a beautiful spirit
has been called "home" to receive its
reward for things Mdone in the flesh,"
it is eminently fitting' that a time be
set aside to be spent in a review of
such an one. On Saturday' afternoon
the Woman's Club of Ocala met to
observe a sweet, sacred hour in mem
ory of its beloved president, Mrs. W.
W. K. Zewadski. ; -
Loving hands had arranged beauti
ful flowers about the club room, and
the first thought as one entered was
how perfect a setting for the mem
orial of a perfect life. The "vacant
chair"! was draped in soft white tulle
as spotless in its purity as was the
character of the one to be remember
euY: Well nigh the entire membership
of the club was present. Mrs. W. T.
Gary, second vice president, presided
in the absence from the city, of Mrs.
R. L. Anderson, first vice president.
Mrs. G. W. Martin of the Methodist
church, read a sweet tribute to Mrs.
Zewadski as a faithful, true', devoted
Christian and worker in the mission
circle of that church. Mrs. E. L. Car
ney, as president of Dickison chapter,
U. D. C, read an excellent paper set
ting forth the .valuable services of
Mrs. Zewadski as a member of that
organization. She also touched upon
the exquisite refinement and gentle
manner of this daughter of the South
land who embodies in her life all the
traditions of beautiful Southern worn
anhood. Mrs. J. R. Dewey, as a close
associate worker on the 'Woman's
Auxiliary Hospital Board, testified to
the fine judgment, the perfection of
detail in work, the swet . spirit and
the great heart full of sympathy for
all suffering humanity exemplified in
Mrs. , Zewadski. Dr. Gross spoke of
her as her pastor's helper and friend.
Dr. Herndon said she was a "home-
maker, the highest type of woman
hood," as set forth in Proverbs, 30th
chapter.- :v''-':v:r . ': S- . ;"
The most beautiful of all these
beautiful tributes was the one tender
ed by. Mrs." R. A, Burford, past presi
dent of the Woman's Club, who num
bered Mrs. Zewadski as one of her
closest and dearest friends. There
was so much in common between
these two noble, women, the same

VALUABLE CARGO
OF THE BREMEN
Baltimore, Md.. Oct. 22. Paul G. L.
Hilken admitted yesterday that the
merchant submarine Bremen was a
month overdue that he feared an ac
cident had happened to the ship and
that she had been lost with all her
crew; and a cargo worth $$,500,000.
In addition to a larger cargo of
dyestuffs than the Deutschland car
ried and medicines, needed in Amer

bringing to this country a serum for
infantile paralysis which had been
ried and found effective.
