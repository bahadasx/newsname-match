VIENNA Oct. 21. (via Berlin and
Sayville wireless to The Associated

socialist, some times known

the meal, but lingered at the table.
Shortly after :! o'clock he arose,
advanced quickly toward the premier,
and fired three shots. The first
missed. The next two struck the
premier in the head. Without a word.
Count Stuergkh fell lifeless in his
chair.
Faron Aehrenthal sprang toward
Adler. The head waiter grasped the
bend that held the revolver. Adler
wtested his arm free and fired two
hots. Baron Aehrenthal was woLnd
l in fie foot. The waiter received
ri!v a superficial wound.
IT. Adler apparent!;- was the calm
t man in the room.' He gave his
rsme ,t the pol.ee without hesita
tion ani added: "If you please,
gentlemen. I know perfectly weU what
I hav e done. I unall not resist arrest."
News of the assassination spread
like wild fire and was received with
indignation and sorrow.

I'Tmeny entered into the arrangement

rationalities were set aside and small
local centers of residence and trade
grew up. In a few years, however, the
American government abandoned its
Kettlement, first because It had no use
Tr it and no money to pay for it. and

it had become known as the "miuuie

British concessions where all sorts of
lawlessness prevailed.
Tientsin grew fast and construction

CLEVELAND, Oct. 22. Storm-swept
Lake Erie today gave up another frag
ment of the story of its black Friday"
another vessel pounded to pieces in
the Flinging gale and grinding waves,
carrying twenty-one men to their
deaths. The last vessel is the whale-
a'k .lames B. Colgate.
Its lone survivor, adrift for thirty and
a half hours on a raft, brought the
.story ashore. Half dead, lie was car
ried off a rescue ship at Conneaut,
Ohio, this afternoon.
He is Captain Walter Grasbaw of
this city, master of the Colgate, which
went down at ten o'clock Friday nigV
off Long Point, Canada, opposite Erie.
Every one of the crew of twenty-one
perished, nineteen of them sucked
down to death the instant the big steel
boat foundered in the storm and tw I
adip'd to the roll when, exhausted, they I
were washed off the raft that carried i
their captain. The ferry steamer Mar-
quet'.e and Bessemer No. 2. picked up j
the captain off Rondeau, Canada, op- i
Ix.site Cleveland. Six men were lost
when the steamer I' iler sank in Luke
Erie on Friday only Captain MaUistm
being up vil. Earlier the steamer
Marshal F. Butters foundered, but its
crew or tnirieen men were raveti.
Orashaw. who Ixl beea master of the
C'ol'.'Hte for only two weeks, is in a
hospital at Conneaut. in a critical con
dition. His w.ff is at his bedside,
Ojiptain c.rahaw could be seen by
his rescuers prostrate on the raft,
numbed hands wrapped around the
ropes twined aeross it, his body lash
ing the waves.
Captain (irashaw's story follows:
"We were passing Ling Point about
6 or 7 o'clock Frid ly night when the
blow i ian. The boat sprang a leak
forward We were all aft at the time;
and immediately we could feel her tip- I
ping and sertlii.g at the bead. j
"Every man worked for his life then j
but it was no use. By 10 o'clock the
s'orm bad increased so that the Col
g'ate didn't have a chance. The gale
was terrific, rains driving and the
waves pounding. V. e got the life rait
really just as the boat was so far down
that t.er decks wi re awash.
"When she sank everybody jumped
into the water. I went down and when
I came up by some chance, my hand
touched the rait. I prahhed It and
pulled myself on it. Just c.s Second En
gineer Harry Ossman and a coal passer
rencbed it. What happened to the oth
ers. I don't know. I never raw them
again. They must have been sucked
right down w ith the ship.
"Then our awful fight becan some
th'ng I'll never forget. Twice tile raft
turned completely over and we were
washed loose, but we managed to re-
1 gain our holds. I must have been un
conscious half the time, for now I can't
remember night from day while the
storm went on anil our raft plunged
with us, never once in sight of a ship
that might rescue uf. unitl this morn
ing. First the coal passer was washed
away. Then hours later, Ossman. to
tally exhausted was washed to his death.
How I managed to keep on the raft. I
don't know. Time and again it turned
