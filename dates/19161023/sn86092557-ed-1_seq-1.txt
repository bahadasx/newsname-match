In Jamison No. 7 at Ilarrackvillu
. where an explosion took place last
i. Thursday been able to locate any or
the bodies known to be In the Interior
v, of the mine.
, At 11 o'clock Saturday the body of
> A. W. Vance was taken out terribly
; disfigured. Identilluation was possible
only by meanB of a shirt and his
chewing tobacco, a brand which none
of the otber men chewed and a pack
of cigarettes which he was known al,
ways to carry. Vance's body was
charred beyond recognition, his hair
being burned oft aud the flush bared
and burnt all over his body. The body
I was taken to Jones' undertaking establishment
where it was prepared for
, burial and subsequently snipped to
Enterprise for Interment.
'. Should any other bodies be recovered
today or tonight It will be bychance
as the men working In the
p mine have gone but half a mile so far
> building air passages, brattlcing and
exploring each section as they go
?. along. When the men reach a section
the entire supply of air is shunted in
i.-' behind them and the supply cut olf
\ the rest of the mine. There are four
I shifts of about 25 men each working
daily. Each shift spends six hours In
the mine.
At the rate the men are progressing
it will take until probably tomorrow
afternon to reach the far sections
where the officials of the coal company
think the dead men are. The
rl' . explorers have reached the stable
fT. where' 2? mules and a brick stable
the explosion took place.
: A rumor that a man was blown to
i pieces and that part of him was found
has been current in Fairmont for the
; past two days. This is denied by the
' mine officials and Is very likely untrue
as there have been outsiders on
I the grounds all during the work.
There la a possibility, the officials say,
that the rumor got started when a
crew reaching the surface after the
first descent Into the mine came back
t: with the story that a man's leg was
j teen at the bottom of the pit. This
' much is true but the rest or the body
' was covered with debris and slate,
.he leg only being exposed. This was
.he body of Islah Leasure. the first
Tnan brought to the surface,
k. 'J The total list of those found are
t; Islah Leasure, Mannlngton, found FrlSt
lay morfllng last; L. M. Jones, momI
aer rescue party, found Friday mornI
tng last; A. W. Vance, Enterprise,
\, found Saturday night 11 o'clock.
T. Those still In the mine are: M. W.
[I Allison, Squire S. L. Vincent. James
V| Uenear, F. Hlgglnbotbam, Harry Dren35;
nen, A. L. Chapman, J. Fagau, John
k;- Foster, colored.
i ine rescue parties are unable to
state just where the bodies of the
' electricians are inasmuch as these
men were in the habit of Jumping on
a motor and running it to any place in
the mine to make repairs. Should
these men be found today or tonight it
will be because they are accidentally
tumbled upon as the brattice party
works Its way tediously Into the interior.
\ Jamison No. 7 surroundings hare begun
to take on a clean and neat ap!
pearance since the men have gotten
f the place clear of debris. The entrance
1 to shaft B has ben provided with an
[ sir chute and a set of air safety doors
k < or an air lock. This permits the air
p. ?free passage Into the mine even while

The mine rescue car and the state
" (facials are still on the Job assisting
' all possible In making the enirance
Into the Interior less difficult and at

Reported this morning as being very

& "went sent into the mine to work at the

the remainder ot the term
Only two attorneys were present
when court was opened, theae being
Curt Amos, and Geo. M. Ralphsnyder.
Five civil cases bad been Bet down foi
trial today and 19 cases on the criminal
docket were to be tried at this
term. All these will go until next
term.
None ot the attorneys being present
Judge Vincent could do nothing except
adjourn. As he stated today,
"The jury and the other expenses of
this court costs the county about $100
per day and I do not propose spending
that much money for a week or more
waiting on the members of the bar to
come Into court and try their cases.
They had plenty of time to be ready,
and agreed upon today for their trials.
Of course 1 will keep the court open to
hear any business that may come up
but from present indications there will
be very little done."
The prosecuting attorney and many
of the members of the bar are too busy
evidently in the political campaign to
attend to their affairs in court. Many
of the criminal cases set down tor trial
were violations of the Yost law which
had been appealed to this court.

by addressing a large crowd of voters.
Within the past tw0 weeks there
has been a most perceptible rise In
the stock of the Republican candidate.
The Judge has spent the last ten days
in the Southern end of the state and
while here has received such assur
ances from party leaders and the rank

Republican victory In this end of the
commonwealth. The northern end of
the state has never been regarded as
other than safely Republican by the
usual majority of the entire ticket.
Since Judge Robinson's meeting at
Huntington last week when he defied
the small coterie of men who sr representative
of special Interests are
opposing him and challenged them to
open combat hundreds of Democrats
have flocked to bis standard and declared
that they will support him because
they realize that he Is unbossed
and unhampered by prenomlnatton
promises.

Significant Figures That are
Preposterous Has B
Rainbow 1
(Special Dispatch lo West Virginian) t
NEW YORK. Oct. 23.?"The people
ot the United Stalee have made up
their minds In favor of Mr. Hughes
and against Mr. Wilson and that la
all there Is to It," said William R.
Wlltcox. chairman of the Republican
National Committee today.
"They have given positive proof of
It on numerous occasions this fall?
proof that cannot be denied, misunderstood
or misinterpreted in a dozen
statements from Maine to California
from Michigan to Maryland where
the voters have hod a chance to stand
up and be counted they have unfailingly
taken advantage of the opportunity
to show their determined preference
for Mr. Hughes Instead of
Mr. Wilson. There is no exception.'
"This Is the thing that counts. Itj
doesn't make any difference what'
claims campaign managers put forth;
?It Is the way people vote that doos
the real talking..
"Here is how they have been voting.
In California 307,793 Republicans
voted in the primaries and only 77,830
Democrats; in Maine the voters
were counted at an election and
Maine-* answer was emphatic ami '
conclusive. There were 79.906 Republicans
and 66,647 Democrats that was
alter a campaign hotly contested on
both sides and where the Democratic
managers made support of President
Wilson the cardinal Issue.
"New Jersey and Massachusetts
show exactly the same situation. In
each state there was a Democratic
contest with one side supported by
the administration. In each state the
administration candidate was defeated
and In each state the total Democratic
vote was far below that of the Republican.
In New Jersey Senator Martine.
seeking renomlnatlon. polled 60.961.
Judge Wescott who had the administration
support agatnst Martlne,
polled 29,627. ThlB was a bard fight
which attracted attention all over the
country because of the efforts of President
Wilson'B friends to defeat Marline.
While this bitter contest was
going on there was good natured campaign
In the Republican primaries between
Joseph Frelingbuysen and
Franklin Murphy each of whom polled
more votes than both Martin and Wescott
combined. Frcllnghuysen won
with 89.361 to 81.480 for Murphy. The
tnf.il Bmnitillm.. 1
,?? ..vrMv?v?i> fWi? "Bit lOiillf 1116
total Democratic vote 119,513 In this
primary. The Borough of Princeton
where Mr. Wilson Is exceptionally well
known, cast 575 Republican votes and
only 262 Democratic votes. Four years
ago at the election Wilson had S63 and
the combined opposition 706. The figures
show what a change has occurred
in Mr. Wilson's home borough.
"In Massachusetts where the Democratic
fight was over the gubernatorial
nomination the total vote was 81,052
while In the Republican primaries
Governor McCall unopposed, received
116,242.
"Back on the Pacific coast the primaries
In the state of Washington showed
exactly the same kind of result.
214,660 voting In the Republican primary
and only 34,970 in the Democratic
primary. The Democrats have been
making some talk about carrying
Washington. That means that they
only expect about 80,000 of the Republicans
who voted In the primaries to
vote the Democratic ticket at the election.
That Is a fair sample of the quality
of these Democratic claims.
"Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Kansas
and Ohio In the middle west have
all given tbe name kind of an Indication.
In Kansas for Instance 138,916
voters cast ballots In the Republican
primaries and only 47.445 in tbe '
Democratic primaries. The Democratic
managers have not yet had the audacity
to claim Kansas, but they have
talked about carrying Michigan. II.
Itnois, Ohio and Wisconsin. But in
each of these states the voters have
shown at the primaries what tbey will
do in November. In Michigan 284,640
rotes were cast In the Republican
primaries and only 29.935 in the Democratic.
In Illinois 420,959 Republicans
voted in the primaries against
238,509 Democrats. In Ohio 282,478
Republicans voted In the primaries
against 139.343 Democratls. In Wisconsin
83.072 Republicans voted in the
primaries and only 36,601 Democrats.
"New York State gave precisely the
same kind of Indications 298.897 Republican
votes being cast in the primaries
and only 158,718 Democratic
votes. ,
"Of course the primary vote is never
as large as the vote at the election.
