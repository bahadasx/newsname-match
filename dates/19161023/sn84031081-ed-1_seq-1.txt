neither was "(.up." What was it all
about ?
I'Aplanal.ious Don't I'xplain.
There were some who explained it
011 the ground that "Cap" knew that
the Montezuma Trust company would
bo brought into the campaign, and
wanted to head off criticism along
that line by having his sey first. If
that was bis idea, "Cap" missed the
target by something over a mile, for
the Jloiitczuma Trust company and its
management have been the subject of
just as much comment as if "Cap"
hadn't spoken perhaps more.
There were- others who declared
that "Cap," with characteristic sub
tlety, figured that .Mr. Iturshart
would come, buck with a hot rejoinder
in the course of which the names of
other democrats would be involved
ami that the kaclnrs of the Grand old
Party of Lincoln would be treated to
edil'.iing sp eta-'le of a merry lit
tle cat-fight among democrats in the
midst of a campaign for national,
io 1 slate and county offices. Mr. Iturk-
j hart, however, has maintained an im
I pi 11 ft 1 aide silence on the subject, and
I all that "Cap" has gotten out of the
