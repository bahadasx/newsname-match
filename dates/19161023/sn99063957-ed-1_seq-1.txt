RUMANIA S BIG SEAPORT
CAPTURED f GERMANS
Mackensen's Armies Drive Rui lians and Russians Back
and Rumania's Greatest Sea g t, Constanza, Is Taken by
Them Capture Puts End tending Russian Troops by
Black Sea It Also Cuts Railroad That Supplied Army
Artillery Fighting Only Along the Somme Front
Berlin, Oct. 23. Constanza, Rumania's greatest sea
port, has fallen before Field Marshal Mackensen's
armies, it was officially announced this afternoon.
Capture of the city is the greatest single achievement
for the central powers since Rumania entered the war
eight weeks ago. The victory is hailed by German mili
tary men as of more importance than all the gains made
by the allies since the' Somme offensive began.
Official dispatches from
war offices indicate that the
fered a disastrous rout.
Smashing northward along the Black Sea coast,
Mackensen's army occupied
Tuzla and then swept onward through strongly fortified
Rumanian lines of defense, marching twelve miles to
Constanza in a little more than two days. The rapidity
of the Teutonic advance is accepted as an indication that
the Russians and Rumanians became demoralized and
made an extremely disorderly retreat. ,
An official statement from Sofia earlier in the day, re
porting the capture of a village six miles south of Con
stanza, prepared Berlin for news of a great victory.
Mackensen's left wing is now approaching Cernavoda,
the war office announced. ?
No surprise was manifested here when it was an
nounced that Mackensen had pushed on through the ruins
of the old Trajan's wall and had occupied Constanza
itself. ; ' .
Since Rumania entered the war, Russian transports
have been bringing Slav troops, munitions and other war
supplies to the aid of the Rumanians. Large bodies of
Russian troops have arrived in Rumania through the port
of Constanza, whose capture . by the central powers
effectually puts an end to the transportation of reinforce
ments via the Black sea.
The thirty-five mile Constanza Cernavoda railway,
leading across the Danube, is the carrier over which
Rumania has derived a large quantity of her supplies.
The Teutonic right wing is
Constanza. while Mackensen's center and left wing are
swinging forward to capture the remainder of the road.
Mackensen is aiming principally at Cernavoda and the
great bridge over the Danube.

Mackensen's advance guards already
linve approached to within less than 10
miles o' the Constiinza-Cemovoda rail
way. The line, carrying supplies into
Kumnuin and the roud over which Rm
nitin troops transported to Constanza
have been brought into Kmnania with
it- two important terminals, is the ob
jective of the Germans' great efforts.

Pyusso-Rumanians have suf-J

wing, defending the strategically im
portant Danube bridge at Cemoavoda is
beating back enemy attacks.
For the second time since the Ger
mans began their campaign to crush Ru
mania, an appeal for help has come
from Buehnrest. The lVtrograd corres
pondent of the Daily News returning
from the Rumanian capital telegraphed
that he was asked by a high Russian
personage to emphnsibze tho seriousness
of the situation.
Kins Ferdinand himself sent n similar
I plea 'following the Rumnuinn defeat in
lrnnsylvauia.
Petrograd dispatches today revealed
for the first time the reasons for the
severe defeat suffered by the Ruman
ians in Dobrudja. l'remier Bratiano be
lieved when Rumania entered the war
what Bulgaria either would sue for
peace or would not fight agaiast Ru
mania or Russia. Only weak forces
were left to guard the Bulgarian border
while the main Rumanian army poured
into Transylvania.
French Capture Hill 128.
Paris, Oct. 23. Following a short ar
tillery bombardment French troops late

DEMOCRATS SAY
HUGHES
W
jj
Claim He Had Agreement
With Pro-Germans As To
Foreign Policy Plank
WAS BID FOR SUPPORT OF
GERMAN SYMPATHIZERS
Chairman Willcox "Denies the
Allegation and Defies the
Allegator"
New York, Oct. 2j. A second state
ment from the democratic national com
mittee, quoting a "plank" adopted by
the 'American Independence conference
following an "agreement" reached
with Charles E. Hughes, followed by a
challenge from Republican National
Chairman Willcox for the democrats to
produce such an agreement, kept the
political pot boiljng here today with
the hyphen issue."
The democrats charged that Hughes
entered into a secret agreement with the
pro-Herman organization, Willcox
entered emphatic denial and character
ized the charges as "the cheapest kind
of advertising in the interests of a lost
cause."
The democrats quoteu what was said
to be tho plank adopted by the Amer
ican Independence conference, calling
upon the peoplo to " condemn the ab
ject surrender of American rights to
Mexico and Kuropeau nations," and
' 4 support Hughes. " .
-At republicua headquarters a tele
gram received from Frank Sieberlich,
who was present at the session between
Hughes and representatives of the con
ference, denying that tht' republican
candidate made auy promises. The tele
gram follows:
"The statement made by Mr. Hughes
relative to the conference with the com
mittee of the . American Independence
conference is absolutly true. Mr.
Hughs saw the committee, of which 1
was a member, made no promises, did
not criticise Roosevelt and made no
statement to tho committee that he
stood for all American rights." - j
After giving out this telegram, Will
cox said:
"If the democrats have any kind of
agreemeat, why don't they present it t
They have my consent, to find any kind
of agreement. This is the cheapest kind
of advertising for a lost cause. There
was nothing secret about the confer
ence Mr. Hughes had."
Willcox went on to say that all man
ner of citizens and groups of citizens
bad seen Hughes, but that ho had made
ao promises in any "shape, manner or
form."
Speaking o'f the lack of secrecy, Will
cox took a fling at the democrats by de
claring he didn't think the "same could
be said of Burlesoa and others who have
sought out certain racial interests."
"I don't think Mr. Hughes would
have a conference at midnight with a
beer party," he declared. The chair
man said none of Hughes' conferences
wore secret, and added that in the vari
ous organizations, who had sent com
mittees to see him, the American Rights
committee was included.
Charge Agreement Made.
New York, Oct. 23. Following the
meeting of representatives of the Amer
ican Independence conference and
Charles E. Hughes at which the demo
cratic national committee charges an
' agreement" was reached between the
republican caadidate and German pro
pagandists the conference made the
main plank of its platform advocacy
of Hughes' election, the democratic
committee asserted in a statement to
day. This plank, according to the state
ment from national democratic head
quarters read:
"We call upon tne American people
to use the opportunity which the pres
ent campaign offers to condemn the
abject surrender of American rights to
Mexico and to European nations and to
support the man who, ha openly pledged
himself to maintain these rights."
The democratic statement charges that
shortly after the incorporation of this
plank, J. P. O'Mahoney, of Indianap
olis, and Victor Ridder, editor of the
Staats-Zeituug, addressed a meeting of
the members of the American Independ
ence conference in Chicago on newspa-
jTer publicity and
outlined tne secret
purpose of the conference to support
Hughes for president and fight for the
election of certain congressmen.
"When the time comes that profes
sional propagandists can attempt to dic
tate the election of a president in the
interest of a foreign country, it is time
for Americans to stand up and repudiate
such attempts," National Chairman
Vance McCormick declared. He said
that, regardless of politics, he consider
ed it a duty to give publicity to such
attempts.
Vice-President Thomas R. Marshall,
who visited democratic headquarters to
day, predicted that any party or candi

Believe Barrett Murdered
Wife and Stepson Hiding
Bodies in Barn
Los Angeles, Cal., Oct. 23 Detectives

ed to by Benton L. Barrett, an agedH
wealthy hnnta -Monica farmer who sur
rendered himself to the police, telling
them he hud killed his wife, Mrs. Irene
Barrett, and her son, Raymond Wright,
today were inclined to doubt Barrett's
story.
According to Barrett, both his wife
nnd young Wright attacked him and
ho killed them in self defense. He told
further how he burned the bodies and
displayed a heap of charred bones to
prove his story. But detectives dcclurc
the hones are not those of a human. In
stead, the theory was advanced that the
murder muy have been premeditated,
and with the charred bones and his
story, Barrett thought ho would bo ac
quitted of uctual murder at a trial, and
surrendered himself for that reason.
Today detectives planned to move sev
eral tons of hay atored in the barn of
tho Barrett ranch, whore it is believed
the bodies may be hidden. BIoodstainB
and other evidence tends to show the
deed was done la this barn mi not in
the yard of their home, as Barrett do
cUired in his story.
A neighbor woman told detectives she
heard four shots last Wednesday com
ing from the vicinity of the Barrett
home.

From Mexican oificinl Bources no ver

Since Saturday's battlo between Car-
