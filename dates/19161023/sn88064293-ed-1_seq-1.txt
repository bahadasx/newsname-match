To the Insuring Public
The trouble and expenses incur
red by the Local Insurance Agents,
because of their inability to collect
their premiums, and the frequent
losses by non-payments has become
so much of a tax on their business
that they have found it necessary to
limit all credit for premiums to 60
days from date of policy. Hereafter,
satisfactory settlement must be made
within that time, otherwise the policy
will be cancelled, for such non-pay
ment.

LOOKS ARE
IMPORTANT
BUT
A good suit of clothes means more
than good looks.
The material must wear, the suit
must fit, the shape must hold, the
style must be right—
But why worry about any of these
things when you can be sure of them
all ? Our clothes have satisfied these
requirements for many years. Their
faithful service has built their repu
tation.
Convince yourself by seeing our
fall styles.

the railroad officials had improved
Morgan City wonderfully in the past
five months by beautifying the main
entrance in and out of town with
civic improvenments, flowers and
shrubbery which the citizens greatly
appreciated. Mrs. Boykin of Jeaner
ette rose for point of information
and asked Miss Mizzi to please ex
plain how Morgan » ity had secured
the favor of the railroad, for her
home town had been trying for \eais
to get the officials to improve the
unsightly appearance around the
depot and in every instance has fail
ed, after begging and pleading for
fifteen years the officials had at last
had the depot floors scoured one
time. Dr. Moss then asked the chair
if a mere man might speak, with con
sent Dr. Moss stated that he thought
if the citizens of Jeanerette would
hold a mass meeting and null the or
dinance compelling the fast trains to
pass through the town at five miles
an hour, thereby causing the many
tourists every day to loose ten minu
tes of traveling time when there was
nothing gained in sight seeing. If
the citizens would be more just in
their treatment of the railroad then
the officials would cease retaliating,
and much good would 1»» accomplish
ed. Dr. Moss' statement was given
h arty applause. Aft»r nth r discus
sions the meeting adjourned. As
ea h lady left the hail sh • was pre
sented at the door by Dr. Moss with

afternoon and Mr. LeRosen with a
