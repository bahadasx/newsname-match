HIGH SCHOOL
CREDITS TO
BE DECIDED
Visit to Grady County of State Inspector
Who Determines Places of Schools
on Accredited List
On tho occasion of his first visit to
this county in the task of placing
high schools and school doing that
branch of work on the accredited lust,
A. C. Parsons, state high school in
spector, is expected to reach Chicka
sha tomorrow morning for a week's
visit to the schools of Grady count.Vtu
corcT.".;' with County Superintendent
Shepard.
All schools doing high school work
will be accredited iu the degree ill
which they are efficient in the quali
fication of their teachers, the length
of their school terms and their equip
ment. On visiting the various insti
tutions Mr. Parsons will discuss these
matters with both teachers and boards.
This is an important feature of
echool work and one which is now re
reiving more serious consideration
than it did several years ago. To en
Joy the privileges of a highly accred
ited school is of great benefit to grad
uates who desire to pursue their sni

Field Secretary for Disbursement of $275,'
000 Indian Educational Fund Will
' , Arrive Tomorrow
Upon the conclusions which will be
reached by Charles Ballard, field sec
retary for the United States depart
ment of interior at Ivluskogee, and
connected directly with the appropri
ation of Indian school money, will be
determined the extent to which Gra
dy county v schools will participate in
the $275,000 which has been appropri
ated by the federal government for
the better education of the Indian.
Mr. Ballard is expected here today
to begin the task of checking up these
reports and accounts in the office of
the county school superintendent
which have reference to this fund.
The sum was appropriated for distri
bution among the schools in the Cher
okee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw and
Seminole Nations and the Quapaw
agency for children of less than one-
fourth Indian blood. Grady county
last, year received S,000 of this mon
ey and this year has asked for $10,-
000 with a fair prospect, in the opin
ion of Superintendent Shepard, to get
it. Uncle Sam believes in hclpingJ
those who help themselves and no ap
propriation will be made to any school
district which has not levied an eight
mill tax, which is three mills above
the allotted five for that purpose.
Some districts are said to be in a
had condition due to lack of necessa
ry equipment but with the $10,001) ap
propriation all will be given the ad
vantage of eight month terms in prac
tically every district.
The visit of Field Secretary Ballard,
to Chickasha is being looked forward
to with great interest in county school
circles.

BIG SIMPSON SPEECH
Deputy Sheriff Was Auctioneer at Tuttle
Sale and Had to Settle Fight Finish
ing Sale Too Late for Meeting
The principles of Democracy and of
the acts which made tho Democratic
administration famous were expound
ed in an address delivered Saturday
afternoon, at Alex by Judge Davenport.
The stirring words which awaited the
audience at Tuttle from tho lips of
i
Oscar .Simpson, lAowever, did not ma
terialize. This was not due to any un-
preparedness on the part of the Chick
asha attorney but to a fight which oc
curred at that place on Saturday dur
ing the progress of a publl-j .:ale which
had been widely advertised and which
drew a large crowd. In another col
umn is given the details of the attack
on .Editor Iiamncic .Deputy snenn
Dan Sn&U was the auctioneer at the
big sale and this had to halt until the
arrest of the offending party was duly
made. By the time the big crowd was
reassembled and the sale concluded it
was too late to hold the mass meet
ing. But everything out there is in good
shape," declared Mr. Simpson today.'
"Tho anti-Socialist lecture which the
people of Tuttie enjoyed had a splen
did effect and you do not find any
street corner Socialist speakers now
as was the custom for some weeks be
foro their opponent arrived. The peo-
pie of Tultle wish 'they -ould
have
Witcher with them every week."
Judge Davenport Speaks.
Judge R. E .Daveiport spoke to a
good crowd at Alex Saturday after
noon in spite of a large sale which
was then in progress. He took up
first the income tax and discussed in'
detail how the Democrats and. Repub
licans had voted on it, told the amount
levied, and revenue yielded in the first
33 months that the law was in effect
Judge Daveiport then took up the
federal reserve act, giving the vote of
each party on the bill in the house
and senate. Ho then told of the estah
lishment of twelve banks with a min
imum capital of $4,000,000, all the na
ttrtr.l bunks being required to sub
scribe one-sth of the capital and sur
plus to establish these banks. If this
is not sufficient the stocks of the
maiks were to be opened to public
subscription and if this was not suffi
cient after a 'certain length' of time
tho United States government would
subscribe the balance
He then took up the -question of ru
ral credits showing the vote of each
party in both the house and in tho
senate. This provides for the estab
lishment of -twelve land banks vWth a
capital of $750,000 each. If a, man
should borrow $3,000 he would pay
$73 each six months and if he paid $13
on the principal he would pay it out
in 36 years. "Money is loaned at from
5 to 40 yep ra on land at a minimum
rato of five per cent. A maximum
loan is $10,000 and they loan to the
extent of 50 per cent of the value of
the land and 20 per cent of the value
of the improvement's. The entire farm
loan debt is $3,398,000,000, loaned at
an average rate of 7.5 per cent. If all
tliit were borrowed at these banks it
would save the farmers $66,000,000 per
annum.
Oklahoma's farm loan debt is $73.
000,000 at an average rate of 8.4 per
cent.
In this connection Judge Drcnport
took up the public school fund,
The'
public school fund had $3,000,000 in
cash and land with an estimated value
of $40,000,000. They are now loaning
$0,31)0.000 on real estate at 5 per cent.
This fund increases at the rate of a
half million a year. In 1906 the
amount of revenue derived from the
school land department was $223,943.
In 1.116 it was $1,097,178.

GREAT SCURRY FOR

Carnival Payday Means Expenditure of
at Least $1,000 for Heavy Apparel
to Meet Fall in Temperature
For the first time during the season
which is now drawing to a close, the
Great Patterson Shows did not break
even in their Chickasha engagement.
This was no reflectiuu either on the
show or on the financial condition of
f'liiekasha, however, but wu due to
tho cold snap which broke into the
merriment of the public when its en
thusiasm had just, been aroused. For
the first time this year, the manage
ment 'on pay day hist Thursday had to'
break into the reserv funds to meet
current expenses. This was the morn
ing of the coldest (lay of the w eek and
a rush was made by many' of the 2)0
people to tho Chickasha stores for
clothing. It. Is estimated that $1,000
was spent on -that occasion. The com
missary spent, from rf23 to $.",n a day,
it is said, while the restaurants and
places of business funiiliing soft
drinks and light lunches were welt
patronized throurjiout the week.
it appeared, in the beginning that
the show had struck a snag in the way
of gaming laws. t'liieT of Police Phil
lips, deeming ill his opinion that un
der the law, the people were not 'get
ting, an even break for their money,
stopped three of the games but a hasty
Hijiistinciil of their plans allowed
these concessionaires to proceed on
a fair, basis. On the whole tho week
was one of decorum and order notwith
standing tho big crowds tlmt patron
ized the shows, and the usual long list
of holdups which usually attend an
affair of this kind was not in evidence.
Whito tho coll snap 1 diminished
the earnings of the show to a consider
able extent the Commercial and Farm
bureau will come out the winner to
the extent of approximately $300 af
ter paying expenses incurred. This
wlli "wipe-out alioul half its indebted
