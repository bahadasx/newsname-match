FIREMEN'S SICK
BENEFIT SOCIETY
TO END ACTIVITY
Oldest Association of Kind
In State WiU Disband
Immediately. '
- About 40 members ef the Firemen's
benevolent -.. Corporation, ' the eldest
sick benefit association of active fire
men in the state) met yesterday after
noon in Room 3 OS, Court Exchange
building and voted to disband .and
divide their $10,000 treasury.. The cor
poration -which was formed in 1872,
now has 74 members in good stand
ing. When the funds are divided
they will receive $133.92 each.
The : association, has at - present
about $7,000 out at 5 per cent, inter'
est in call loans. As soon as Attorney
Thomas SI. Culllnan, cpunsel for the
corporation, can arrange to have
these loans paid in, which It is be
lieved can' be ' done in about two
weeks, vie cash will be divided among
the members. .. . j '
The meeting yesterday was to have
i been called in the office of the fire
commissioners, but former ChleY Ed'
ward Moo'ney.itfo Is president of the
corporation, decided that the meeting
might Interfere, with business which
the commissioners would have and be
procured another room from the Jan
itor of ' the building. , '
The motion p disband and flivlde
the,, money was made ' by, Secretary
Henry Tate and there- was not a dis
senting voice among the 40 members
present. . It was the -largest meeting
the corporation has held In eight years.
One of the reasons for disbanding was
that the members have lost Interest in
the association and for : years it has
been Impossible to get a quorum at
any of the meetings or to transact the
business according to the by-laws.
Besides President Modney and Secre
tary Tate the officers of the corpora
tion are John P. Baum, financial sec
retary, and James E. Burke, treasurer.
The report of the " treasurer read' yes
terday, afternoon showed sometfclng
aver $10,000. : J . yv; -
Many of . tie members are retired
lemen or former , commissioners of
the department, . I .. -
The corporation .was organized in
1872 afp the fire in the Tomllneon
Spring ft Axle Co. factory, which for
merly stood where the Blue Ribbon
garage anf Henry Carstesen's stables
are now located. '. -
In those days Chief Gerdenier ' and
few officers were the men who were
stationed "vermanerkly in the fire
houses were th eonly paid members
of the department. Several firemen
were Injured at ths fire, and Mr. Tom
Iinson, grateful for the efforts of the
fire fighters, not only took care of the
injured men but donated $100 to the
department. It was then proposed to
form a sick benefi association and the
Firemen's Benevolent corporation was
organized. -- All' active members of the
department at that time were, included,
as well as the commissioners. The
plan was to pay $5 per week sick ben
efit and $7 per week if a man were. in
jured while onJuty. The payments
wer for 13 weeks in any one year.. In
1878 the, organization was incorpor-
ated-- ,i : .. . ' .
J In later years; dissension broke out
among the members and several fire
men who sought admission were re
fused .membership. Other '.firemen,
knowing ; the . circumstance's, - 'were
afraid to apply for. membership. The
result wa the society did not grow
and of late years "the, members with
the exception of a few, have paid lit
tle attentioa.to the corporation.
, No new members have been taken
in during the Jast e?ght years o'ther
than ,to pay their .dues. As the as
sociation is hot nsw serving the pur
pose for .wfcich it was organized the
members decided to disband. I
v Another fact thai hastened the dis
solution of the association Iff the' ac
tion ' of the active firemen who are
preparing to form a sik "benefit or
ganization which . will 'include all
members of the department. The fire
men have 5,108, the proceeds of their
spectacle "Fighting the . Flames"
which will be the nucleus for the sick
ibeneflt fund. As in the past, (dona
tions to the fire department have gone
to the Firemen's Benevolent corpora
tion, future donations will go to the
new association. k

NOT ISOLATED
Tot' is Sent ' Home From

' . Two Days.
'Possible disapproval of the theory
that ' infantile paralysis is contagious
was seen today by local physicians
who have followed the cases in the

other cases, have been reported from

Dr. E. A, McLellan, the health, of
ficer, said however, this afternoon that
the . case isn't paralysis. He didn't
know Just what the case is.' The
child will be taken to' her home, on
the theory that if nobody sufferedi
from her illness, other than erself,
during four weeks, it is unlikely any
will now that she is convalescing.
Dr. Abraham Sophian, who con
ducted the health campaign here,
maintains' that the theory that infan
tile paralysis is contagious, is based
on sound rationale, j Other experts
have advanced. the opposite belief.
