BRITISH RESUME OFFENSIVE
DURING FIGHTING WEATHER
Battle Front is Similar to That of
Gettysburg: in Crucial Battle
of the Civil War
(Copyright, 1916, by The A. P.)
BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE,
Oct. 23. With the return of fighting
weather, the BrltUh resumed the
oftenBlve on a larger scale this) after
noon and turned on enough gunfire
and sent In enough troops to make
sure Reglna trench was theirs. It was
the most important attack for three
weeks.
All this month Reglna trench has
been developing a sinister reputation.
It joins onto the old first line forti
fication In the neighborhood of Th lop
Til, and anything In that region, with
comfortable dugouts, the Germans
like to retain, In order to prevent the
active battle front from broadening
and for another reason which a
British soldier expressed when he
aid:
"With winter coming on, we feel
the need of those deep, snug dugouts
the Qermans spent so much time In
building."
Parties of the British got posses
sion of portions of Reglna trench on
several occasions, but the Germans
swarmed In front of their burrows
and repulsed the invaders. Evidently,
Reglna trench was not to be taken by
nibbling and required one big bite.
In such cases, there is nothing to do
but to wait until clear weather, when
the gunners can see what they are
doing and torn on a number one ar
tillery curtain of fire.
Yesterday morning,' a set gunner's
smile was on the face of the whole
army. Instead of rain and mist mak
ing a gunner' bane of low visibility,
an almost wintry sun was shining in
crystal clear air literally an artll
leryman's heaven. All the gun tribe
necessary for the job were up and in
position already waiting for such a
day as this, when the eyes that see
for them from the observation posts
can tell whether the practice shells

WAR NEWS
AT A GLANCE AUSTRIAN
(By Associated Press.) ,
In the face of continued violent attacks by the Teutonic allies.
in Dobrudja from the Danube to the Black sea, Rumanians and
Russians are falling back. ' ;
Toprai Sari and Cobadin have been taken by the combined
Austrian-German-Bulgarian and Turkish forces.
On the Transymiiia front, hard but undecisive fighting continues
in the mountain passes. Petrograd says the Rumanians have been
forced back in the Buzea valley. Bucharest, however, does not
concede this, asserting that Teutonic counter attacks were repulsed
at the point of the bayonet.
The battle of the last week along the Narayuvka river in Galicia
has resulted in an important victory for the Austro-Gennan forces
over Russians, according to Berlin. Here the Russians now hold
only a small part of the front on the west bank of the river after
general attack by the Teutonic allies between Svitelniki and
Skomovochy. Petrograd says, however, that the fighting is still
going on, and that the positions have changed hands several times.
Twice during Sunday in the morning and in the afternoon
Germans launched violent attacks against the positions newly
aptured by the French in the Chaiilnes wood, south of the Somme.
Both attacks were repulsed, according to Pans. Some of the
attackers in the morning offensive gained a foothold in the French
first line, but were surrounded and the 150 survivors made prisoners.
Berlin, in admitting that in Saturday's fighting the British north
of the . Somme made gains, characterized the British losses as a
'reckless sacrifice of human lives." Several trenches between
Blanches and La Maisonette, 'south of the Somme, were recaptured
Saturday, from the French, says Berlin. I
On the Macedonia front, slight progress has been made by the
entente allies in the Cerna river region. German troops are aiding
their Bulgarian allies in the fighting at the bend of the Cerna.
Heavy rainfalls and snowstorms are impeding the operations in
the Austro-Italian theater.
A German aeroplane, which droped four, bombs at Sheerness,
England, Sunday, is believed to have been the same aircraft that
was destroyed later ' and fell into the sea, under the attack of a
British warplane. , .
