flFTEfi KILLING
Assassination of Austrian,
Premier Causes Grave Dis- ;
orders in Capital.
London, Eng.. Oct. 13. According to
a wireless dispatch from Rome, rioting
broke out in Vienna. Austria, after the
assassination Saturday of the Austrian
premier, count Carl Stuergkh, by Dr.
Adler. a newspaper publisher. The dis
patch said the police were unable to
check the grave disorders. The dis
patch also reports manifestations in
Athens favoring the Intervention of
the United States against the entente's
occupation of Athens and Piraeus.
Plot Acalnt Tlim.
The assassination of count Stuergkh
lends new Interest to the details of a
plot to assassinate count Ttsza. the
Hungarian premier, which reached
London today by mall from Budapest.
Two young men who were arrested in
connection with this plot were named
Zoltanbire and Zaborisky. Each of them
is 19 years old.
They made their plans ca'efully. par-
chased revolvers, prepared measures for
their escape from the country after-
toe country alter
wards and had communicated with
several persons from whom they ex-
pected assistance.
At their trial one of the young men
pleaded not guilty, but made a defiant
political speech In which he denounced
count Tisza as a traitor against the
nation and declared he would continue
the plot against the premier's life as
soon as he was free.
Km! Parliament Proponal.
The death of count Stuergkh came at
a moment when he was apparently
about to vleid to the well nieh unlver-
! s?l demand for the reconvocation of
me Austrian parliament. Tne negotta-
tions between the various party leaders
and count Stuergkh had been In pro-
gress lor .several weeks and the pre-

Uament-onTlho ground thai the Tmem-
ers agreed not to speak too freely on
foreign affairs and militarv nnestlons.
The assassination of the premier will
probably put an end to these negotla-
lions ana it is reared will lead to
stricter measures on the part of the
government.

issues, senator Fall's speech was de
voted mostly to Mexico.
He said he had Just come from the
Democratic Pecos valley, where he was
sere the Republican state ticket would
get at least 569 hitherto Democratic

ministration's tariff acts and said he
had a number of bills in the senate for
the betterment of New Mexico if he
could only get the approvitt of the de
partment of the interior for them, but
he couldn't get it, notwithstanding that
A. A. Jones had been for three and a
