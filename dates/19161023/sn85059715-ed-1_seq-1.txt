ONE CENT SALE TO BE
HELD AT DRUG STORE
A !
Local Rexall Headquarters An
nounces Bargain Offerings
for Last of Week.
A remarkable one-cent"sale, which
ia to be held throughout the country
by 8,000 Rexall drug stores, is an
nounced for Thursday, Friday and
Saturday of this week at Sturm and
"Wilson's, the Rexall drug store of
Clarksburg.
The plan of this one-cent sale is
anounced by the llexall Company as
follows: on the days advertised, a
purchaser who buys an article of es
tablished value at its regular price is
entitled to buy a second article ex
actly the same, for one cent, no ma'
what the regular established price.
Vor example, if a person buys a tube
of Rexall tooth paste for twenty-five
cents a second tube is sold for one
cent. If the purchase is a Maximum
hat water bottle for $2.00, a second
Maximum hot water bottle may be
taken for one cent. Dozens of other
articles are Included In this sale.
For Introduction.
A material part of the cost of all
merchandise is due to the expense of
introducing them to new customers.
By the one-cent sale plan this cost is
reduced. Goods of standard value
are sold to many thousands of new
users. The Rexall concern believes
that the best advertising is the sat
isfied user; that If one is pleased with
a tooth paste, soap or any other arti
cle he will continue to use it. And
thus the concern makes many new |
customers.
By selling for one cent goods
ranging in price from ten cents to
$2, the Rexall store offers a strong
inducement to try merchandise of
tho highest quality and become a per
manent user. Distribution is in
creased at less cost. Both the pur
chaser and the Rexall store gain.
Through OO-opemtion.
| Even so, the one-cent sale would
; not be possible except for the great
| co-operative purchasing power of the
more than 8,000 Rexall stores. These
stores operate great factories
with branches and control the entire
output of others. They are able to
sell goods of maximum value at
minmum prices.
That there may be no misunder
standing as to the quality of these
products. It Is understood that the
Rexall store will cheerfully refund
the money paid on return of the
goods if after one tries tliem he feels
each item is not worth the regular
price.
Everyone in Clarksburg and ItB
vicinity is expected to take advantage
of this remarkable sale and to keep
in mind the dates, Thursday. Fri
day and Saturday, October 26, 27
and 28. Those who recall the one
cent sale conducted a year ago by
Sturm and Wilson should make it a
point to attend this sale early in or
der to have the opportunity of a bet-x
ter selection. Last year's sale was
one of the biggest ever held In
Clarksburg at bargain prices.

SCHOOL BOY, 12,
KILLED BY AUTO
Roy Miles, of Industrial, Killed
in a Most Tragic Manner
Sunday Afternoon.
CRUSHED AGAINST A POLE
Dominick Burgess, Driver of
Car, is Jailed on a Murder
Warrant.
In full view of his father and a
younger brother, George Roy Miles,
a twelve-year-old school boy of In
dustrial, was run down and killed by
an automobile driven by Dominick
Burgess, janitor of the Empire build
ing, shortly before 1 o'clock Sunday
afternoon. The accident occurred
just in front of Nutter's store in In
dustrial.
Burgess was jailed Monday noon
on a murder warrant sworn out
by J. V. Miles, father or the boy, in
Magistrate T. G. Nicewarner's court.
Earlier in the day Burgess had sur
rendered himself to the authortles
but was not placed under arrest then
as at that time there was no charge
against blm.
Funeral services for the victim of
the accident will be held in the
Church of the Immaculate Conception
at 9 o'clock Tuesday morning and in
terment will be in the Holy Cross
cemetery.
The Father's Story.
J. V. Miles, father of the dead boy,
told his story of the accident to a
representative of the Telegram Mon
day morning. "My two little boys
and myself started out to take a walk
a little after 3 o'clock yesterday at
ternoon. We were just in front of
Nutter's store when the accident hap
pened. Hoy was on the boardwalk
that leads across a small ravine to
the store. The boardwalk is at least
four feet from the curb. I was out
in the street and my other little boy
Albert, was near me. An automobile
rushed around the curve, grazed me
as 14 went past and struck my little
boy from behind, crushing him
against the telephone pole. I saw
that my little boy was dead, and then
I grappled with the driver of the
car. I don't know whether I released
my hold on him, or whether he fought
himself loose, but anyway I ran back
and picked up the dead body of my
little boy. Then some people took
him away from me, and I went back
to look for the driver of the car. I
couldn't find him, and some friends
took me ajra*. 1 recognized the
V
driver as Dnminick Burgess. llo Is
the same fellow that came very near
running my wife and little boy down
about four weekH ago when they
alighted from a car."
Another Slile of the Tragedy.
According to the story told by one
of Burgess's friends, who was In the
car at the time, the accident was un
avoidable as Burgess turned hit) au
tomobile towards the ravine in or
der to keep from crashing into a
crowd of people (hat stood In the
street. He said that in doing this
Burgess took a chance of being killed
himself and damaging bis cur to a
great extent. The road is very nar
row at the curve, he said, and In
order to avoid running Into the crowd
it was necessary to drlvo over the
bunk and into the rainine.
Dr. S. M. Mason, coroner, an
nounced Monday morning that an in
quest would be held at 4 o'clock on
Tuesday afternoon at the Lynch-Os
born Undertaking Company's build
ing on West Main street.
The father of the dead boy said
that the telephone pole, against which
I the victim wus crushed, was broken
off. Others said that it was merely
pushed out of its socket. The pole
stood on the side of a bank.
Surviving: Relatives.
The victim of the accident Is sur
vived by his father, who is employed
In the Clarksburg Pottery Company's
plant at Industrial his stepmother;
three brothers and two sisters. The
brothers are John J. Miles, of Aurora,

and Albert, at home. Mary and Kath
arine, both living at home, are the
sisters. Two stepbrothers also sur

The dead boy was a student in the

tragic death. Last year he attended
the St. Mary's high school in this city,
