Its movements became wilder and wild- |

had come and with it a still higher'
sea. Occasionally we made veritable
leaps, but we calmly blew out our
"tanks" and got to the surface in a '
quite orderly manner.
As we reached periscope depth, 1 )
tried to look around, hut it was still
almost impossible to see anything, for

would cut into thick water mountains. ,

made the waves appear even more un
canny and bigger through the peri

crushing force.
Then we came completely up to the

tower to pet a correct view of the
wildly dancing sea. i

a witches' caldron of wavebot with ,
foaming crowns, toys of t'- wind,
