BAKER AS A TARGET
Secretary of War la Object of Attack
In Address by the Colonel,

8peaklng For

Hughes. 5^!*
[By J. P. Yoder, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
ALBUQUERQUE. N. M., Oct. 23.—
Colonel Roosevelt fairly ate his way
through Albuquerque—New Mexico's
largest city, today. Due for a five
hour stop, he was given a breakfast
reception frum eight to nine-thirty
and a noon d&y banquet from 12 to
1:30 after he had spoken at ten
o'clock.
Roosevelt got another big recep
tion here with the ubiquous bombing
and bands.
Secretary of War Baker was the
particular target for Roosevelt's cam
paign darts today. The party* ar
rived here about an hour late and
the colonel was glad enough for the
extra hour's sleep. He was slightly
tired when be left Phoenix early bun
day.
It became known today that the
colonel will probably aiiswet* appeals
of West Virginians and go on for
one and per'iapi two speeches In
that state when he goes through.
His Baltimore speech _will.be Mon
dayTJf Tuesday "of next week.
The secret of the unexpectedly
long stop at Gallup, N. M., came out
today. It was at Gallup on the way
west that the colonel got his worst
taste of heckling. The Roosevelt
special was supposed to stop less
than five minutes. It was held up
twenty-tive mlrutes. It has since
been learned someone familiar with
air brake attachments turned -a screw
which kept the brakes tight until
every brake was examined and the
trouble remedied. Railroad officials
have started an investigation.
Colonel Roosevelt's address here
today,was as follows:
"^hen men occupy an improper
and unpatriotic position and seek to
justify themselves by precedents
from the past, it is almost Impossible
for them to avoid misrepresenting
the facts t£ey desire to quote! in
their favor.
"President Wilson's positions and
actions have been entirely justifiable
from the standpoint of those who
justify the positions and actions of
President Buchanan. But it is utter
ly impossible to defend the conduct
of President Wilson save by inferen
tially condemning the conduct of
such presidents as Washington, Jack
son and Lincoln. If President Wil

especially toward Mexico, if his atti

dustrial affairs are. proper, -en
Washington, Jackson and Lincoln
acted Improperly in upholding and
saving the union ahd defending our
position agnlnst interference of
foreign nations by readiness and
ability to use forcfe. If their attitude
toward army and navy was right,
then the attitude of Mr. Wilson In
appointing and maintaining Mr.
Daniels as secretary of the navy and
Mr Baker as secretary of war is
wholly undefensible.
"Mr. Baker is an amiable pacifist,
who I don't doubt, could render re
spectable service along other lines,
but he Is exquisitely unfit for his
present position, and would never
have been appointed to it if Mr. Wil
son had been willing to look at the

Ex-

Martin Salinas, who succeeded to the
command, after Ozuna's death, was
seriously wounded, were the reports
received here today by agents of Unit

and transmitted to Washington.
Large forces of the 'bandits under
personal command of Villa were en
camped at Fresno, only, ten miles west
of Chihuahua City last night, menacing
the largest and best fortified cltv in
northern Mexico, according to these
reports.
From Mexican official sources, no
verification of these reports was avail

Carranzistas and Villlstas, an unusual
ly rigid censorship has been main
tained by defacto officials and repre
sentatives of mining companies were

print little of the battle except to say
there was heavy fighting, resulting in
a victory for the Carranzistas.

EJL PASO, Texas, Oct. 23.—Villlsta
bandits have surrounded the western
side of Chihuahua City, after driving
the Mexican defacto government
troops into the outskirts, and another
attack upon the northern Mexico capi

unconfirmed report teaching United
States departments here today. Verifi
cation of this, however, is lacking,
and Carranza officials still insist that
defacto troops are driving the bandits
toward Santa Tsabel.
"An official CarranzistS statement
dated Saturday and made public to
day by Consul Soriano Bravo, states
that heavy fighting between Villlstas
and de facto forces continued through
out Friday and Saturday, with very
heavy losses on both sides. The state

Organisations.
AGREED NOT TO OPPOSE

Denies Making Any
Pledges.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
NEW YORK, Oct. 23.—With candi
dates and their supporters swinging
into the election home stretch, the
hyphen Issue popped up today with a
renewed vigor. Democratic charges
against Hughes as to an alleged deal
with hyphens were dented by the re
publican candidate.
Hughes rested at Montclalr, N. J.,
in preparation for a final campaign
dash while Colonel Roosevelt in the
west continued his effort to swing
votes to Hughes and Wilson at Shad
ow Lawn prepared for a ringing Wil
son day speech this week.
At the home stretch, developments
rounded today thus:
"Democrats claimed Hughes dalt
with the racial organization—the Am
erican Independence conference and
promised a second installment today.
Hughes denied making any promises
In private, though admitting having
had a conference with organization
leaders.
Dupont .Powder Co-, officials admit
ted they would oppose Wilson because
of the munitions tax measure and be

constructing a nitrogen factory.

diers—a comparison denied by Baker.

however, was in the foreground. Ac

Hughes' visitors saw him after he had

his Lewlston anti-German-American
speech. Then said the democratic
