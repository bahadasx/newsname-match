WIN PRAISE FOR MANEUVERS
BUT MILITIAMEN LONG FOR
HOME SAYS RICHARD DEVINE
IN CAMP AT FORT CRITTEXDON,
Texas, Oct. 8. We are the second day
In camp on our supposed-to-bo 10
days maneuver, but us yet nothing
has turned up to Indicate any mane
uvers at all as we huve done nothing
since arriving In camp with the ex
ception of one hour's drill, but lay
around doing bunk fatigue, play po
ker, buy pies and candies, and hunt
souvenirs nt the old fort and on the
artillery rani;r near by. Some of the
boys left camp yesterday and one of
our company succeeded In bringing
down a small deer which we enjoyed
today.
KtH-oml (V)iincrtlfut Raided.
Lust nlKht was somewhat of a wild
affair as the Second Connecticut In
fantry was aino ro camp, as part of
our brigade in the maneuvers, and as
our boys had had one day s rest and
were feeling fine, they thought it a
good time to give the tenderfeet a lit
tle touch of life In the far west.
So as soon as It had became dark
enough to enjoy a fire, most of the
rtglmeftt went Out back of the picket
line and proceeded to fire up, after
which they commenced to mill around
in the wildest Indian dance ever con
ceived. All at once when the dan
was at Its wildest ebb silence sud
denly made itself heard and the
dance stopped, then forth from the
frothy mouth of some frenzied dancer
came the cry, "Lets get Connecticut'
and the damage was done. NojW fol
lowed perhaps the greatest charge in
tho history of the guardsmen on the
border. Down the hill, across the In
tervening ravine, up the hill on the
other side and over the Connecticut's
sentinels In to their camps. We were
now treated to such sights as heads
sticking out of pup tents others spar
cely clad figures wrapped In blankets
scampering into groups, back to -back
for safety, and all pleading for the
safeguard of their tents. Having ac
complished their purpose the boys
now charged as madly back to the
fire and were here treated to a dash
of cold water, as It were, by the lieu
tenant colonel and the officer of the
day, who ordered them back Into
quarters and to leave the Connecti
cut boys get their much needed rest.
We now went to bed satisfied that we
had lived up to our nickname of the
Taqul Indians," which the Conn, s
call us.
This morning Connecticut moved
out on the return trip to Nogales to
entrain for home the fifteenth and
you can Imagine how we felt when we
were given no moving orders and had
to stand Idly by and watch them go
marching out, but we managed to
cheer them a little whicn tney re
turned warmly nnd we were forced to
admit that they w-e a pretty decent
sort of a bunch after all.
Feeling blue as the distant hills and
cursing the luck that had placed us
In this predicament we watched them
disappear down tho canyon and then
returned to our tents to sleep and
dream of home.
Manouvrra Were Started.
About 2 o'clock we were awakened
from our afterdlnner sleep (a luxury)
by the bugles sounding first call and
assembly and this was followed by
the order to strike camp, what for, we
did not know, but there were wild
rumors of going home and of fight
ing in Nogales. We had nearly com
pleted our march kits when the order
came to pitch tents again as we
were not to move out until tomorrow
at 7 a, m. Where we are going to
morrow we do not know, but shall
move out about 11 miles on a tactical
problem, and that the next day we
shall start on our return to Nogales.
As to going home, that Is still a mys
tery', but we have hopes of being on
the train before the 20th of October
as tomorrow, the 9th at 11 o'clock we
will have been on the border 90 days
Are Raiding Mexican.
October 9, 4 p. tn., Elgin, Arl7
Here we are at Elgin, a day's march
from our last camp, and hourly ex
pecting to be ordered out to meet the
enemy or to move out on a night
march.
The situation Is like this. Our bat
talion was ordered out th!s morning
at d:30 a. m with a battery of Utah
artillery and some mounted scouts to
assume the part of a raiding Mexican
party on a foraging expedition sent
out from Nogales, which we have
taken and are now foraging the coun
try for cattle. We have reached El
gin and have about 400 head of cat
tle when we are closed In upon by tho
Americans about 400 strong on the
south. We find that our retreat is
tut off by a regiment which has closed
In on our rear. It is now up to us to
reach Nogales as best we can and be
lieve me we can sure do that if we can
only get the orders. Our major, Ma
jor Wlllkens of Hope. Idaho Is, In our
r pinion, tlAS best officer in our regi
ment, both as to manhood and as an
officer and tactician and we lay our
hopes on his ability to get ua out of
this terrible predicament
Tomorrow will perhaps see us nt
the break of day miles away from our
Present position and we hop to give
the enemy a merry laugh when they
pull into Nogales two or three days
from now.
The guardsmen at Nogales are leav
ing as fast aa possible as both regi
ments of Connecticut guards and part
of the Utah boys have already return
ed and California is to return the 11th.
Hope we can return soon.
First Rattle is Won.
Oct. 11. In camp on the Santa
Crui river. Well we are at last en
camped again on the dirty old Santa
Crux river, and I hope It Is the last
time.
The last two days have been very
monotonous to our regiment and es
Mexican raidinarty and have pene.
trated the enemy's country and cap
tured a large herd of cattle, when we
are harassed by two regiments of in
fantry and two batteries of artillery
along with a troop of cavalry, when
we reach Elgin, and have to turn back
and beat a retreat for Nogales.
We left Elgin at 7 05 a m. on a
course due west. The enemy's position
was six miles due south and our ob
ject was to gain the pass at Old Fort
Crittendon, thus avoiding being cut
(ff by the enemy. The distance to be
covered was eleven miles and we ne
gotiated this distance, without a stop
by 10:15 a. m. We had only seen the
enemy once during this time and then
they were not even within good artil-

JURY DISAGREES
IN BLEDSOE CASE
DR. BEST
BEFORE
CASE TO 60
.1
After being out for nearly 24 hours
the jury in the damage case of Bled
soe vs. O.-W. R. & N., reported to the
court yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock
that It was impossible to reach a ver.
diet and the court dismissed the jury
men from further consideration of the
case. The ca. e required the agree
ment of only nine jurors but they were
hopelessly divided In their opinions.
Mrs. Bledsoe was suing for $10,000
for the death of her son, John Milton
Morgan, and she alleged he was kick
ed from the train on which he was
"beating his way" by Brakeman
James MacMahon. Her principal wit
nesses were the three companions of
her son, but her case was weakened
when the defendant brought out that
on of these witnesses was an escape
from a reform school. Defendant's
principal witness wag MacMahon and
his testimony to some extent was dis
credited.
Whether or not the case will be re.
tried has not yet been announced.
