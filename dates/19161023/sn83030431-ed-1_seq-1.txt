WOUND PERILS CUT
IN HALF BY CARREL
I
Process Devised hy New Yorli-
ei
Reduees War Amputa
tions ."i0 Ter Cent.
Paws, Oct. 22. A system of slerlll
Ing wounds which has been successfully
applied at the hospital nt Complegne
under the direction of Dr. Alexis Carrel
of New. York. Nobel prlne winner, has,
, . ,. ,
been extended to the American hospital j
nt Ni-ulllv. the American and Belgian
hospitals In Belgium, and will probably)
, .. . ,. , '
Ik. adopted In all the war hospitals of
the Bntcutc Allies.
HuKhes le Rbux, editor of the Mnfiu,
describing a visit to the Complegne hos.
pltal. quotes Dr, C.irrel as saying:
"Beginning lu September. 1915. It
would have been possible to suppress
completely the suppuration of wounds In
the hospitals, but our process encoun
tered such resistance from the heads of
the profession that It was, so to speak,
applied nowhere, though the lives of a
great number of wounded would have
been raved by this means.
The process as described hy M. Is
lloux consists of complete Irrigation of
tin- wound by means of n rubber tube
with numerous branches perforated with
many small holes.
The process of healing Is carefully
watched, and If normal healing docs not
ensue the wound Is examined for for
elun substances which might have In
advertently remained, and Irrigated
unew. Hut the removal of muscles or
bones nof Irreparably Inlured Is not
practised on the first or second cxamlnn
tlons as frequently ns has been the case
heretofore, nnd In this) way parts are
sated which might otherwise have been
lost.
When examination shows that the
wound Is aseptic Hie wound Is closed.
"Kxperlence shows," snya Dr. Carrel,
"that tu u sterilized cavity thus closed
nature's healing process goes on with a
rnpldlty hitherto unknown, The dura
tion of the treatment Is abridged about
two-thirds and the number of amputa
tions diminished 50 per cent. In certain
rases complele healing occurs In one
tenth the time required under ordinary
treatment."

many troops from the Transylvanian
