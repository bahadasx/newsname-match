Must Qualify for Future Responsibility by Not Interfering
with War Now, Garvin Says?Points to Lincoln
as Advocate of Non-Intervcntion.
By J. L. GARVIN
London, Oct. 22. As November ap
proaehes t>io attitude of the Allied neo
ples toward the Amcrii-an Presidential
elrction bcconies a parndox which is
easilv misundcrstood and the better
wf.rtii exaniiniiijr. The result is await
ed with intenre ctiriosity, yet no cam
paicn has ever attracted less intrrcst
in it.-elf.
t'olonel Roosevelt made himself a
world prrsonafce as vividly familiar to
the popular mind on this side of the
Atlantio as King Kdward or the Gvf
man Emperor. Very few in th is
hemisphere nre able in the same way
to realize the personalities of Mr. Wil
soii or Mr. Huphes or, as we say. to
"put a face" on either.
Nor is the distinction between their
policirs clearly understood. Add to
thifl the overwhelminfr preoceupations
of the war and it is easy to understand
whv there is so little demand for either
news or comment about your contest.

Ask Wilson to Repudiate
Attack on Washing

[Fr? U? Trlbun* Bur??a.l
Washington, Oct, 8? Nationa! offi?
cers of eleven patriotic women's <<r
gani/atinns signed a re*olution to-day
demanding the resignation of Secre
tary of Wur Baker, and the repu.iia
tion hy Presidcnt Wilson of Mr
Baker's companson of Mexican ban
dits with Washington's Continentals,
printed exclusively in The Tribune.
Mr. Bi'kor is declared by thr re-o!u
tion to be "a man of such amaztng
ignorance of hi^tory and so llfhilf
in ideab" that he is "not a fit hcad
for the army of the Fnited States of
America, and would tend scriously to
injure its morale."
The demand that President Wilson
repudiate his Cabinct minister's words
results from the fact that Mr. Baker
made the comparison which is so oh
noxious to the women ,n a speeth up
holding the Prrsident's Mexican pol
icy.
Flaker'n Spcech Quoted
Following is the resolution:
"Whereas, Newton D. Baker, Secre
tary of War in the (abinet of Presi?
dent Wilson, in making a pohtical
speech in defence of the Mexican pol
icy of the Administration, at Jersey
( ity, on the night of October 16, 1916,
made the following compar>on be?
tween the Megican bandits supporting
the vanous leaders in that country
and the aoldiers who fought the war
for Amencan independenee in 1776 a*
follows:
"'Sonie oeopl* say they eannot un
derstand tha Pre^ident's Mexican pol
icy, and 1 want to tell you why. They
have forgotun our own history and
the Declnration of Indepcndence. and
the President has not forgotten either.
Why are we impatient at the Mexi
cans? We say they do not respect the
lives and property of our people. Per
haps they don't. We say they do not
pay their bonest dehts. They don't.
We say they are a ragamuffin lot. We
say their money is not any good
That's true. It ia only worth two or
three cents on the dollar. We say
they do not respect church property.
That, aho, is true.
"Werr So Like Mexico"
"The amazing thing is that people
never respect these things in a revo
hition. We had a revolution. and
from the beginning to the end of that
the conditions in this country were so
like Mexico that il iJ perfectly
aatounding to read.

'CLEAR EVIDENCE
HUGHESWILLWIN
?i
Calls Claims of Wilson
to Doubtful States
"Vaporings"
A forecast of the coming election
was made yesterday by I hairman
William R. Willcox, of the Republican
National Committee, based on the vote
in the primaries in the various s'tates.
Hc pointed out that in many of the ao
called doubtful states. or those to
whioh the Democrats arc now laying
claim, the Republican r^marv vote
was decidedly the heavier.
"No clearer evidence could be given
of the intention of the voters to mani
fest Ikolf Republican preference on
November 7," said Mr. W.llcox. "In
none of the statea outside of the 'aolid
South' where a primary election has
been held this year has the Democratic
vote como within hailing distance of
the Republican vote."
Evtfl in atates like Massachusetts.
where there were contests in the Demo?
cratic party over the nominatioru, !
wbick would naturally be expected to
bring out a large party vote, he pointa
out that the Democratic vote fell far
ifcort of the Republican totals.
?People Glye Proof
The statcmcnt follows:
"The people of the l.'r.ited Sutes have '
made up their minds in favor of Mr.
llughes and against Mr. Wilson, and j
that is all there is to it. They have given
positive proof of it on numerous occa- ]
siona thii (all proof that cannot be ;
aenied, misunderstood or misinterpret
ed. In a dozen statea from Maine to
Galifornia, from Michigan to Maryland,
where tho voters have had a chante to i
stnnd up and be couhted, they have un
fudingly taketi advar.tage of the oppor
tunity to show their determimd pref?
erence for Mr. Hughes initead of Mr.
Wilson. There is no exception. l
"This is the thing that eounts. It ;
docsn't make any differenco what
claims campaign manajrrrs put forth -
it Is the way the people vote that, does
the real talking.
"Here is how they have been votmg.
In < alifornia, 307,793 Republicana voted
in the primaries and only 1 <,8*0 Demo?
crats In Maine the voters were count
ed at an election, and Maine'a answer
was emphatic and conclu.sivo There
were 79J02 Republ:..-ani and 88,641
Democrats. That wa.s after a ea?pal?
hotlv eonte.st.d on both lldaa, and
whtrt the Democratic managers made
support of President Wilson the car
dinal issue.
Wilson'a Men Bo-,.ten
"New Jersey and Ma?<achusetU ?bow
rxactly the same situation. In each
state there waa a Democratic contest
with one Hide supported by the Admin

nothing in private that I have not said in public.
"At the verv beginning, tn my speech of arceptance, I deolarrd

"To this maintenancc of American rights I shs.1! continue to ad

Ml ia his offlce at 11 o'clock last
night. Ord.narily Mr. Locb leaves at
1 p. m. Sitting opposite was John
Henry Htil, principal of the Morgan
Park High School.
In a corner of the room Mrs. Marie
Moore was talking with John E.
Jones, a private detective. Suddenly
Mr. Loeb thrust a flst under tha prin-,
cipal's nose.
"Heil, I want your promisa that you
will never write another letter attack
mg the reputation of Mrs. Moore or ,
any othcr woman," he shouted.
Principal Called Poltroon
Heil wet his dry lips. His ?oice
quavered as he aaid, "I proraise."
"And to protect the tnterests of the
hundredc of thousands of innocent1
children from such as you, I demand
your resignation," continued Mr. Loeb.
Heil then wrote his resignation. Mr.
Loeb asked H he had any money. He
said he had not.
"I will give you twelve hours to
leave the city of Chicago," Mr. Loeb :
said. "If you are here at the cnd of
that time, I will prosecute you with
all my power. This hearing is ad

Drawing some bills from hia pocket,
Mr. Loeb flung them at Heil, who left
the building.

It was late last evcning that Mr. Ixieb

learned that Heil had written more

HIGHElT LIVINGCOST
PREDICTED WITH PEACE
Federal Official Predlcts Ruin
ous Compctltion Abroad
[Krom tri<? Trlbun* Ii i-??u ]
Washington, Oct. 22. A tremendoua
leap in the cost of living, coincident
with a slump In the demand for labor,
will follow peace in Europe, a govern
ment trade expert declared to-day. He
also predicted higher prlces and leaa
work than the country has eyer known.
I This condition, he decla-es, will be
brought about through an enormously
j increased demand for raw products.
I partieularly foodstuffs, in Europe, and
an almost eomplete eessation of de?
mand for manufactured products. Eu?
rope will have to be restocked and the
i great body of European labor furnished
with material to tum into manufact
ures with which to reenter tho world's
markets.
Par from reducing the eompetltlv*
power of European labor, according Uj
this estimate, the war will virtially
double it. Women, children and aub
star.dard men have been tratned to
amazing efflciency. The men in the
trenches have undergone a discipline
that will greatly inerease their effi
ciency. European labor, lt ia predicted,
at once will be cheaper and more plen
tiful and productlve than ever.
The expert goes on to dcclare that In
the I'nited States, on the other hand.
the demand for foodstuffs and raw
products of all kinds will aoar, whlle
the failing demand for labor now em
ployed in manufacturing will throw
thousands out of work and reduce the
standard of living, it is predicted. Erom
the highest level in its bis'ory Ameri?
can foreign trade in manufactured
jroods is expected to dwindle to an un
precodentedly low figure, due to cheaper
labor and greater effieiency in Europe.

that there ls a secret agreement be

A. OTjoary is the head.
The charge waa made In a eolorful
statement that revealed fleeting
gllmpses of a atenographic report of
] proceedings of the conference's two
recent meetinjrs In Detroit and Chi?
cago. Much plottlng and secret ar
tivlty Is darkly hinted at by the Demo?

To Whet the Appetlto
This paragraph, attached to the laat
l page of the itatement, was eonsidered
| aufficient to whet the appetite for more
{ disclosures:
"The second inetallment of this re
markable revelatlon of polltical in
trigue will be made public to-morrow
i by the Democratic National Committee.
It will give the faeta in convincing de
tail, likewise disclosed by the offlcial
recorda, of the FULFILLMENT by Can
I didate Hughea of his promise, tha
WORKING ACREEMENT between the
Ameriean Independence Conference and
the Republican National Committee,
the RKWARD reaped by Mr. Hughes
and his eampaign managera and the
CONCEALMENT by them of their deal
ings with the CLeary aggregation."
i
Hughea Coneealed Noth'ng
Mr. Hughea robbed the situation of
much of ita dramatic value when ha
frankly admttted that he had received
' the committee when it called upon
him. He was surpriaed to learn that
Democratic cash had been spent for
stenographic reports that contained no
faeta not readily obtainable clee
whefe.
Mr. Hughes aaid he had told the
delegatlon just what his vlews on
Ameriean righta were, aa he had rlone
in hi* speech aceeptanee and in many
other public utterancea.
As for statcmenta eoneeming Mr
Hughes's congratulatory telegram to
Colotie) Roosevelt, following the Pro
gressive leader's speeeh at Lewiaton.
Me., it happened that there- was much
other evidence bearing on the aub
ject- The Democratic eempaigTi eom
mittee's statemert. charged tnat Mr
Hughes had apologized to the visiting
delegation for his Roosevelt telegra~.
saying that he aent it before he had
read the apeech, having aeen only the
headltnes.
It happened, however, that the groop
of newspaper men who were with the
Republican candidate when he aent the
message from his special train in Kan
?_ knew that this portion of the
rl.arge was untrue. They had asked
for a statement from Mr. Hughes on
the Roosevelt speech early in the morn
ing of the day following lU delivery.
Mr. Hughea then refused to make any
commont on lt because he had no'
roa ! it.
Dinng the afternoon, however, he
obtamed copies of the newspaper eon
taining the speech and read them egre
fully. When he had oompleted ii"
reading he answered hia interviewers.
and, having completad his talks with
them, he sent his telegram to the Colo
nel.
Shoni of lts plctureaque phraaeology.
the statement chargea that the Ameri?
ean Independence Conference dele
?.'a'ed a committee to call on Mr.
Hughes and obUin a atatement of hia
views on questions of intereat to tha*
body after its meeting in Detroit, on
Septernber 7. The committee waa com
po*ed of Carl E. gchmidt, of Detroit,
national ehairman of the committee:
n'Le&ry, Will R. MacDonald. ehairman
of th>- Ameriean Embargo Conference,
and Frank Seiberlich. of Boston.
( ommitte* Set* Hoghee
This committee, aecording; to yester
day's statement. called on Mr. Hughes
some time between the adjournment of
the Detroit meeting and another one
I held in Chicago on Septernber 30, and
1 obtained from him a satisfactory atate?
ment of his position on national iasuoa.
Incidentally. they are eredited with dia
cu-t.-mg with him his telegram of con
gratulation to Colonel Roosevelt fol?
lowing h,s Lewiston, Me., speech de
! nouncing "diluted Americaniam " The
minutes are said to show that Mr
Hughes assured the committee that he
sent the mesaage before i reading the
speech in full.
That the report of this interriew was
made at the later meeting of the con?
ference in Chicago is shown by this
paragraph, quoted from tha eteno
graphic report:
"J. A. O'Leary then reported to the
N'atior.al Committee the meeting that
the special committee had with the
