ALASKA RAILWAY AMD BREMERTON
PROJECT THREATENED BY HUGHES
G.O.P.Choice for
Navy Secretary Is
Positive Menace!
Danger lurks right ahead for the Northwest,
especially for Seattle and Puget sound, if Hughes is
elected.
The Alaska railroad is threatened. Its aban
donment means the loss of millions to the North
west.
The Bremerton navy yard program of battle
ship construction is under attack. Its surrender
would mean the loss of a permanent payroll and
increased commercial as well as naval prestige to
the Northwest.
What are the business men of Seattle and the
Northwest going to do about it ? Are they going
to permit these disastrous consequences?
They are threatened if Gov. Hughes is elected
president.
WEEKS FIGHTS NAVY PROGRAM
Already the worst enemy of Bremerton navy
feard is mentioned as Hughes' favorite for secretary
RSf the navy. It is none other than Sen. Weeks of
Massachusetts, the ardent reactionary who led the
fight against government construoion pf vessels,,.
Neither Hughes nor any of his spokesmen Ms
thus far seen fit to discredit the statement, often re
peated, that Sen. Weeks is to be secretary of the
navy. If he gets that position, the navy yard pro
gram at Bremerton is absolutely doomed.
And what about the Alaska railroad and the
territory's development? Hughes came to Seattle,
and so did Fairbanks, and so did Sen. Beveridge.
They all remained silent as to the Alaska railroad,
the greatest government project in the entire North
west, of vital importance and interest to Seattle.
Government ownership and operation of the
Alaska railroad is a settled Wilson policy.
What is Hughes' attitude toward it? Sen.
lames Hamilton Lewis says there is now a scheme
under way to kill the Alaska project.
HOW DOES HUGHES STAND?
W Government construction of battleships at our
own navy yards is a settled Wilson policy.
Will Hughes continue it? Sen. Weeks' ani
mosity is the answer.
there are undoubtedly greater questions on
which the nation will determine the presidential
election than either Alaska or Bremerton.
To the Northwest, however, they furnish ad
ditional reasons why Woodrow Wilson must be
re-elected.
POINDEXTER AND TURNER
George F. Cotterill, progressive democratic
candidate for congress in the Seattle and Kitsap
county district, is right, absolutely right, when he
says that Alaska and Bremerton need men at Wash
ington who are fundamentally right on government
ownership.
That is why, too, Sen. Poindexter, progressive
republican, is needed at Washington, as against
George Turner, reactionary democrat, attorney and
advocate for Guggenheim interests in Alaska.
President Wilson has plainly outlined his poli
rcies on these two propositions, which mean real
dollars and cents to this portion of the country.
Hughes is allied with interests opposed to
these projects.
The danger sign is out.
Stop! Look! Listen!
A sensible regard for "Safety First" requires
that Seattle and the Northwest vote for President
Wilson's re-election.
