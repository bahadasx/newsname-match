TAXES AND LAWS
Republicans Turning Cold
Light of Publicity on
Democratic Rule.
EXPENSES ARE HIGH
Interesting Figures Show
That Tulsa Pays Kxor
bitant Revenue.
TAXES and the vicious election
law are the issues the Republican
party and its candidates in Tulsa
cuunty are battering hardest In the
state and county campaign. Not that
these issues are the only ones, but
they have proved to be the ones the
voters like best to hour and think
about.
Chairman A. A. Small of the county
central committee caused a letter to
be written to the county clerks In fifty
counties divided between the slates of
Texas. Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas,
Illinois and Indiana rciiucsting them
to give the population of the county
and the expense of county government
in their respective counties during the
last fiscal year..
Itcpllcs were received from IS coun
ties and a comparison of the tax
rates as compared with that of Tulsa
inuda such an interesting argument
that ten thousand copies were ordered
printed and distributed in every sec
tion of tho county.
It is a significant fact that Jasper
county, Mo., has two district courts,
the population is 89,67 3, tho county
expense last year was $1 67,121.83, the
cost per capita being $1.87. Carthage
and joplui have district courts.
Only- One Court Hero.
Tulsa county has ono district court.
The census of 1910 shows tho popula
tion to be 34.99.1, the county expense
last year was $376,680.27 and tho
cost per capita $10.78.
