CITY COUNCIL MEI MONDAY NIGHT
' _
Proposed Amendments Discussed : Recess Taken I'ntil
Next Monday Night
The Morgan City Council met
Monday night in the Council Room
of the City Hall for their regular
December meeting. A full attend
ance was present with Mayor Shan
non presiding. After a reading of
minutes of the previous meeting,
which were approved and ordered
spread on the records, the bills for
the current month were read and re
ferred to the Finance Committee.
The report of the standing commit
tees were read and accepted.
Petitions for saloon license were
presented by Mr. S. Caro and Mr.
B. Mula. Both petitions were held up
for investigation and will probably
be ated upon at the next meeting of
the council.
The couuncilmen ratified the ac
tion of the Mayor in the steps taken
by him to perfect the acquisition of
the Ditch Annex property which is
being utilized by the city for caring
for the live stock and street imple
ments belonging to the city.
A resolution was offered amending
the ordinance fixing the exhibition
license for street shows, street fairs
or carnival companies and making
the city licenses for a week of such
exhibitions or shows to read $500.00.
The ordinance amended provided for
a license fee of $250.00. This amend
ment was favorably received by the
council.
An ordinance proposed for the
licensing and regulating of bill
posting privileges was tabled.
Action on amendment to the or
dinances governing the use and con
trol of water provided by the muni
cipal water works and providing that
meters be installed on all new con
nections as made and on all old
connections within one year from
date of completion of the proposed
amendment was deferred for further
consideration. This proposed amend
ment provides for the payment of
the meters by the property owners
on an easy rent basis plan and is de
signed to adjust the expense of oper
ating the waterworks on the equit
able consumption plan. The meter
rates mentioned in the proposed
amendment call for a charge of 20
cents per thousand gallons for the
first five thousand gallons used. 18
cents per thousand for * the second
five thousand gallons, 16 cents for
the third five thousand gallon^, and
continuing on a decreasing cost
basis for amounts used until the

Dr. C. C. DeGravelles, city health
officer, came before the city council
and called to their attention the ex
istence of certain unsanitary con
ditions created by the existence of
the present style of pit cesspools in
use in section of the city not within
the water and sewer districts. He
suggested as a remedy for these con
ditions the adoption of sanitary fly
proof metal cesspools, a model of
which he presented for their in
spection with the strong recommen
dation that some steps be taken to
safeguard the health of the city by
adopting same. No plan of action
was suggested and the matter re
mains in the hands of the health offi
cer and the councilmen.
A report from City Engineer and
Waterworks Inspector Thorgeson
was presented showing the costs of
operation for the water works and
sewer system for the years 1914,
1915, and 1916, also the revenue re
turned from such operation.
Chief Thorgeson's report follows:
12-4-16.
Hon. Mayor and Council,
City.
Gentlemen:—
Following find a report I have
tabulated from the City Books and
my records, on the cost of operation
etc., of the waterworks plant and
sewer system, for the years, 1914,
1915, 1916.
From this data you can get com
parative information for the time
that the plant has been in operation,
and an estimate as to what it will do
in the future.
I am quite certain that we can re
duce the cost of operation consider
ably in 1917 as well as increase the
revenues.
I have ipade arrangements to get
alum at an exceedingly low figure
and you will notihq that our alum
cortsumption has decreased this year
and also that the wash water has
been reduced from 7.1 per cent to
5.9 per cent and I believe that we
can reduce it to 5 per cent which is
the average of-plants of our type.
I have experimented with an extra
screen or strainer for the suction of
f,he sewer lift pump and find that we
can decrease the current consump
