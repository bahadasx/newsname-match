GIRLS WILL PLAY
BASKETBALL HERE
The local girls basketball team
will meet the La Grande girls' team
in this city on next Friday night.
This will be the first basketball game
of the year and should arouse a great
deal of enthusiasm. The local girls'
team Is almost the same one that
tiBT6M-le4 th Khool last year and
from advance notices from LA
Grande it seems as If that city has
equally as experienced a team as ha
Pendleton. It is certain from the riV.
airy of the two schools that a good
game will be seen.
Gentlemen of the Congress:
In fulfilling at this time the duty
laid upon me by the constitution ot
communicating to you from time to
time Information of the state of the
union and recommending to your con
' slderatlon such legislative measures
as may be Judged necessary and ex
pedient I shall continue the practice,
which I hope has been acceptable to
you, of leaving to the reports of the
several heads of the executive de
partments the elaboration of the de
tailed needs of the public service and
confine myself to those matters of
more general public policy with
which It seems necessary and feasi
ble to deal at the present session ot
the congress.

JAY MOSIER
BOOTLEGGER
Jay M osier, who until a few days
ago was proprietor of a cigar store in
the city, was caught In the police toils
last night and the evidence was so
strong that he was fairly embarked in
the bootleitglng business that he for
feited ball of $160 rather than stand
trial. Incidentally he has departed
for other regions and must remain
away or take the chances of paying
further for his Illegal trade.
Hosier's method of operation, ac
cording to the police, was similar to
that of the men apprehended a short
time ago. He was securing liquor In
shipments from California and ad
dressed to fictitious persons. He was
claiming the shipments through the
medium of strangers. Two shipments
alleged to have been for Mosler. came
yesterday. They were addressed to E.
Ward and William White. P. H. An
drews claimed the liquor consigned to
E. Ward and was promptly arrested
as a witness.

The president's message was the
shortest he ever delivered. The ner

COLUMBIA, S, C, JJec. 5. The
state agricultural and mechanical col
lege for Negroes at Orangeburg will
erect In February, March and April
three buildings, ont to contain class
rooms and an auditorium, the other

S. Wilkinson is president of the col
lege. Councilman Phelps who is on
the lighting committee, says the
committee will request that the
contract be changed so as to per
mit of cancelling the contract
should a municipal plant be es
tablished or should a rival elec
tric company enter the lield. He
predicted that these changes and
perhaps others will be made be
fore the contract is adopted.
Other members expressed
themselves equally forcible.
Councilman Penland, who Is al
so on the lighting committee,
said he did not consider It neces
sary to turn the town over to the
electric company and would not
stand for tlie 10 year contract as
submitted. Somewhat similar
sentiments were expressed by
Messrs. Folsom. Murphy and
Taylor. Mr Murphy said a five
year contract would be long
enough and looked with favor on
a clause allow liur the contract to
be cancelled If a municipal plant
Is established.

attention should lie given t the
arrans-incnt of the street lights.
He understands that the telephone
company Is soon to remove Its
poles from Main street and

light- are to he swung" when that
change Is made.
The contract was referred by
the council to the lighting com
mittee and It Is presumed a re
port will be made to the council
tomorrow evening.
The contract as submitted to
the couiuii by the electric com
pany would tie the city np for a
10 year period, whercan the pres
ent contract ban a proviso for a
minliiwl plant should one he
desired. Under the proposed
contract the compa.V charges the
same as at present for lights.
