January at $49.00 per ton delivered at Mt. Sterling is now costing us $136.00 per ton. We have
refrained from raising our subscription" price as long as possible but unprecedented increases in

vill be $1.50 per year. Subscriptions and renewals will be received until that time at the old rate
of $1.00 per year. Kindly read the-label on your paper and if in arrears please call and settle or
