WILSON GEM
ANII STRIKE LAWS
Annual Address to Congress
Was Devoted to Domestic
Affairs.
(By Assuulatcl 1 ": ? ?*<*)
WASHINGTON. Pee. 5.?President
Wilson's address at the opening of the
session of Congress today was wholly
devoted to domestic subjects, principally
the problem of railway legislation.
In the Hall of the House with Senators
and Representatives assembled in
join session, President Wilson in accordance
with the custom he began at
the opening of his term, read his address
from the clerk's desk.
The President not only renewed his i
recommendation tor legislation to prevent
a nation wide railway strike or ;
lockout before there has been opportunity
for investigation, hut defended
it against the attack bf organized labor
as nothing arbitral* yor unjust and J
the "justifiable safeguarding by society
of the necessary processes of its i
very life."
Aside from recommendations for the
passage of the Porto JUco government
hill, the corrupt practices bill and the
Webb bill to legalize American collective
selling agencies abroad, the
President's address was devoted whol
ly to the railroad situation. The only
feature which had not been forecast1
was the elimination of the proposal '
that Congress give explicit approval
to consideration hv the Interstate'
( ommerce Commission of an increase i
in freight rates to meet additional ex-!
pendilures by the railroads caused by
the operation of the Adaiuson law.
The full text of the President's
address will be found

Meeting Will Be Held in j
Fairmont Next Tues- i

To investigate the present system '
of oar distribution, thereby hoping to
effect a more uniform supply ui 1110 ,
mines, will be (lie matter taken up at {
a meeting of the coal operators of the ]
Fairr/.ont district called for next Tuck i
day, lieoeniber 12th. to be held in the s
rooms o?f the Fairmont Chamber of i :
Commerce. Tne <-.< il was sent out yes- j
j onlay. About sixty operators control I- | |
ing 125 mines arc concerned in the ;
results of tile session. ; '
Car shortage lias been a great prob- ?
lein this year with operators everyvhcre,
ami Fairmont district coal men *
have liecn forced to meet peculiar conditions.
.? fluctuating supply rang T
ing from 30 per cent, or normal to !M) -1
per cent., and then hack to 30, lias
been the local experience.
The ilaltiinore and Ohio distributing
system lias been held responsible
for this, since in trying to arrange a
proportionately equal supply over the \
eight divisions of the company they ,
are in the habit of skimping one divi- (l
sion one week to make up to another u
'; i? i m 1111 a siiui uijm* ui ill'1 \>?*?i\ ir.iuir,
and the next week turn more ears to "
the ilirisiou whielt lia'l been sfimped 1
in an effort to liuiintain the equality. '
The operators will protest apainst this , IJ
practice and ask for a supply that will j''
hit an average between the two ex-1
ironies?about a 60 per cent, supply.
The Baltimore offices of the Haiti- -i
more and Ohio have declared that be- J
cause the Monongah division is one oi
the largest on the system and so far
away from the directing offices, it Is
hard to care for with the same degree
of attention given to other divisions.
The Fairmont district operators be-|p
Ilevc they are belter acquainted with ' c
local distribution and are going to >
work out an improveo plan to be sua-: t
mittcd to the railroad officials, J n
W'lien it is considered that the aver-;
age normal shipment of coal from the ; ri
Fairmont region totals about T.'.OOU ! Ii
tons per day. it can he seen to what a
an extent a fluctuation of from 30 to ?
9o per cent, would affect their httsi- 'i
less.
