Fighting at Athens Creates Grave
Crisis in Greece
GREEK STEAMERS ARE TIED UP
Will No Longer Be Permitted to Sail
From British and French
Ports.
London, Dec. 4. While King Con
stantine is taking measures to make
amends for the fighting between his
troops and those of the Allies at At
hens the Allies are preparing to take
strong action at once, probably
against the King.
Lord Robort Cecil announced in the
House of Commons today that King
Constantino and his Government were
deeply involved and that the Allies
will "take immediate measures to ob
tain a radical solution of the difficul
ty." The Uritish Government has follow
ed the action of Franco and prohibit
ed the sailing of Greek steamers from
Uritish to Greek ports. The Greek
Minister at London and the Greek
Consuls at London and Manchester
have resigned, saying they could no
longer identify themselves with the
policy of their King.
A semi-official announcement issued
at Athens says.
"By order of the commander of the
garrison of Athens all civilians and
soldiers off duty are being disarmed.
The departure of the French detach
ment from the capital is following
the consent of the Hellenic Govern
ments to hand over six batteries to
Vice-Admiral du Fournet. A commit
tee of Greek and French officers is in
vestigating the reasons why Greek
troops came to blows with the Allies,
despite direct orders to the country."
The Government has announced
that the fullest protectioji will be giv
en to the Nationals of the Entente and
that all legal rights of the arrested
Venlzelists will be respected.
A despatch to the Daily Mail from
Corfu, under date of Saturday, says
that the Greek mountain guns in the
Corfu citadel have been handed over
to the Allies.
The attack on the Zappeion was
quite unexpected. Vice Admiral du
Fournet was standing on the steps
of the building surrounded by officers
of the French marines, when Greek
machine guns opened fire. Six officers
were woundod b ythe first volley. The
French marines, together with 250
British marines who had marched to
the Zappeion without molestation, or
ganized a defence and hold out all
day against a superior force with ar
tillery. WEATHER FORECAST

Vermont, fair and colder tonight and

THIS STOPS HAIR
FROM FAILING OUT
Ever count the dead hairs in your
comb and brush? They are nature's
warning of future baldness and proof
that the dangerous dandruff germ Is
busy on your scalp.
Dr. Sangerbund, the fatuous Paris
specialist, first discovered that dand
ruff and falling hair are caused by a
microbe. Then came the discovery of
the value of the real Parisian Sage
(liquid form) in destroying the dand
ruff germ and promptly preventing
the further loss of hair. The effect of
only three days' use of Parisian Sage
is simply marvelous, and the American
people have now awakened to the fact
that they can be quickly rid of dand
ruff and save their hair by using Paris
Jan Sage.
Parisian Sago is sold by William L.
Gokay and good druggists everywhere.
It's inexpensive, daintily perfumed,
free from stickiness, and will surely
cause hair to grow soft, lustrous and
really seem twice as abundant.

GEORGE S. HALEY KILLED
Former Rutland Man Run Down by
Auto In New York
George S. Haley, for over 10 years
connected with the Rutland City Elec
tric company and the Kutletnd Kail
way, Light and Power company after
the companies were merged, died
shortly after 1 o'clock Sunday morning
in the Roosevelt hospital in New York
city as the result of injuries received
a few minutes before when he was
run down by a "night hawk" taxicab.
Tho car was running at a terrific rate
of speed, it is claimed. Mr. Haley had
been attending a banquet at the Wal
dorf Astoria given to President Wood
row Wilson in honor of the illumina
tion of the Statue of Liberty.
, He left the hotel with a friend with
whom he was going to Michigan, but
just previous to the accident the men
had parted. At Columbus circle, 59th
street, Mr. Haley left the subway and
was probably planning to take a sur
face car when he was run down in the
stieet by the taxicab.
Mr. Haley was lorn hi Manchester,
N. II., about 52 years ago, and edu
cated in the public schools of that sec
tion of the country. He learned the
machinist's trade and when a young
man moved with his parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Thomas Haley, to Buda, 111. La
ter Mr. Haley attended tho University
of Iowa where he obtained the degree
of electrical engineer.
Mr. Haley's first big work was the
construction of a power plant for the
Western Electric company at New Or
leans. He was engaged at this task
for about three years and came from
New Orleans to Rutland in March
1901.
Mr. Haley was made the manager of
the Rutland City Electric company
when this was a separate concern
from the Rutland Railway, Light and
Power company, which at that time
-was running the traction line, gas
company and developing the Chitten
den power lines and plant.
. In 1908 the Rutland Railway, Light
and Power company took over the
Rutland City Electric company and
Mr. Haley was made general manager
of the company.
In May, 1912, Mr. Haley resigned
and was succeeded by I. M. Frost, Mr.
Haley taking a position as general
manager and vice president of the
Texas Power and Light company, with
headquarters at Dallas, Tex. This com
pany had charge of the power lines
which supplied current to about 100
small towns in Texas. Mr. Haley re
signed his position there last June
and was elected president of the Gen
eral Engineering and Management cor
poration of New York city, a large
concern handling public utilities all
over the country. t

throughout Berlin last week when it
was realized that women would be
forced Into the factories, according

vants and wives of soldiers, outside of

Petrograd Admits Fumaniufs Con
tinue to Give Ground
HOPE RESTS ON RUSflAN AID
Arrival of Czar's Troops May Result
in Keeping Germans Out of
Capital.
Petrograd, Doc. 5. In the face of
overwhelming odds, the Rumanians
before Bucharest continue to retreat,
the war office announced today.
Berlin, Dee. 5. Field Mackenscn's
victorious forces have crossed the- rail
road leading to Bucharest at Pargovis
ta. The attempts of the Rumanians
to check the advance on tho capital
have failed, the war office announced
today.
Ixnulon, Dec. 5. The ai rival of Rus
sian troops before Bucharest at the
critical moment when the loss of the
capital seemed almost certain has
somewhat changed the Rumanian situ
ation, said a dispatch from Petrograd
last night. According to military
opinion at the Russian capital, the Ru
manians now have at least a lighting
chance to retain their capital and
with tho aid of the Russians, who ren
dered their first valuable assistance
to the Rumanian demense by an offen
she in the Carpathians begun five
days ago, will now attempt to include
Bucharest in the zone which they
are able to defend, establishing a per
manent line north and west of the cap
ital.
According to information received
at Petrograd from Bucharest, the
German plan of encircling Bucharest
was perilously near to accomplish
ment when It struck an unexpected
obstacle in the form of a Russian
force between Bucharest and the Dan
ube. Strong cavalry columns of the
Teutonic allies had been sent forward
on both wings of the united front of
Lieut Gen Krafft von Delmenslngen
and Field Marshal von Mackensen,
forcing the Rumanian fianqs backward
both north and south of the capital.
A Hanking movement was partly
successful, when the Teutonic lorces,
advancing from Lake Greca. encoun
tered a sudden stiffening in the re-
slstance of tho Rumanians, due to the
j arrival of Russian troops, and were
compelled to retire in disorder. Em
i placements had already been complet
ed for the big guns which were to
bombard the Bucharest fortifications.
Executing a hasty retreat, the Ger
mans and Bulgarians had to abandon
guns of all calibers and a large quan
tity of war material.
The northern Teutonic allied group
which is attempting to flank Bucha
rest from the side of Piteshti has pro
ceeded with greater success, but the
Rumanians have managed to retreat
without losing connection with the
force defending the western fortifica
tions of the capital.
