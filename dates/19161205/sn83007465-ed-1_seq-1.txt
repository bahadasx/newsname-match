SIXTY-FOURTH CONGRESS
OPENS ITSLAST SESSION
MANY BIG PROBLEMS.
Reconvenes for Short Term with
Calendar Already Overcrowded.
Washington, Dec. 4.?Congress reconvened
today for a three months
session with a calendar overcrowded
with general legislation, facing railroad
reforms and the high cost ol
living as new issues and confronted
with unprecedented estimates aggregating
$1,654,819,654 to meet expen
attures of the government for the fiscal
year 1918.
Both houses adjourned early as o
mark of respect to the late Senatoi
Clarke of Arkansas and Resident
Commissioner Rivera of Puerto Rico
both of whom died since the September
adjournment.
Tomorrow there will be a joint session
in the hall of the house to hear
the address of President Wilson
which will contain recommendation*
for legislation sought by the admin
istration before tire Sixty-fourth con
press dies March 4 next. That rail
road legislation to supplement tin
Adamson act will he urged by tin
President as the most important
problem before the congress at tli
time is pener?Jy expected.
Must Hasten Work.
How to expedite their work is the
problem which leaders of both houseare
endeavoring to solve. Besiderailroad
legislation there is stronp
public demand for legislation to curt
the soaring prices of food. In addt
Hon to appropriation measures the
senate has the immigration bill
the corrupt practices bill further tc
limit campaign contributions and expenditures.
the Webb bill to gram
authority to domestic corporation*
for maintenance of collective foreign
selling agencies, conservation ami
other measures.
Then an investigation into expenditures
of the recent national cam
paign is proposed and Senator Owen
r?l" Oklahoma will introduce a join!
resolution directing that su<h an in
ijuiry he instituted at once.
Hasty conferences of house leaders
today convinced a majority that :
"speed up" program advocated b?
Speaker Clark will be adopted wit!
only slight changes at the most. Ma
jority Leader Kitchin joined with th<
speaker in declaring that the usua
long Christinas holiday should b<
dispensed with and earlier meetinj

set.
Some Want Kcccss.
No active opposition to the ear'?
meeting hour has appeared but ther<
is some dissatisfaction over the pro
posed abolition of the Chirstmaholidays.
A compromise holiday oi
one week, beginning the Saturday
before Christmas, has been suggested
and favorably received by man)
members.
Although food embargo proposals
are certain to create much discussion
few leaders are inclined to believ<
that any of them will be enacted lntr
laws. Representative Kitehin thinks
too. that investigation of the higt
cost of living will be left to the executive
departments.
It is regarded as doubtful that am
of the President's railway legislatior
program will reach the floor before
Christmas. Representative Adam
son, chairman of the interstate com
meree committee, who will pi,lot thf
measures, said tonight that he woulo
spend the Christmas holidays ai
home regardless of any adjournmeni
agreement.
Will 1'rge Suffrage.
Representative Raker will urge an
early report oh his universal suf
frage measure, now held In the judiciary
committee. The suffragists did
not appear at the capitol today tc
make a, demonstration as had been
expected.
Inauguration of three new senators
who appeared with their credentials
was postponed until tomrrow
because of the desire to adjourn 1r
respect to the memory of the latf
Senator Clarke, president pro tem
pore. The new senators Watson 01
Indiana, Fernald of Maine and Kirh>
of Arkansas? were given seats in th<
chamber.

ascertained. The work will consist
largely in public health surveys, rural
sanitation effort and general or- '
ganization of plans and purposes to 1
stay the spread of communicable dis- *

Dr. Riser was for four years associated
