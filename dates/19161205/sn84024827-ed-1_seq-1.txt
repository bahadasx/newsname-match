WASHINGTON. Dec. 4. Congr ess re-convened today for a three
months' session, with a calendar o vercrowded with general legislation,
facing railroad problems and the h ish cost of living as new issues, and
confronted with unprecedented est imates aggregating $1,645,819,654 to
meet expenses of the government f or the fiscal year 1918. Both houses

Hear President Today.
Tomorrow there will be a joint ses
sion in the hall of the house to hear
the address of President Wilson, which
will contain recommendations for
legislation sought by the administra
tion before the sixty fourth congress
by March 4, next. .
Food Issue, Big One.
Leaders of both houses will endeavor j
to expedite their Work and frequent
conferences to plan a program will be
held as s" an as the President indicates
his desires. Besides railroad legisla
tion, there is strong public demand for
some executive action to curb the
soaring prices of food. And, in addi
tion fo appropriation measures, which
always take time and must be passed,
there are other issues. The immigra
tion bill, the corrupt practices bill
"further to limit campaign contribu
titms, and the Webb bill to admit cor
porations to form collective selling
combinations in foreign markets are
among the m'ost important of the
measures to be taken up.
To Speed Up Work.
Hasty conferences of House leaders
today indicated that a "speed up" pro
gram advocated by Speaker Clark
would be adopted with only slight
changes. Majority Leader Kitchin
joined with the speaker in declaring
that the usual long Christmas holiday
should be dispensed with and an ear
lier meeting than n'oon, probably 10
o'clock, set. No active opposition , to
the early meeting hour has appeared,
but there is some dissention over the
proposed abolishment of the Christmas
recess. A compromise holiday 'of one
week, beginning the Saturday before
Christmas, has been suggested.
Embargo An Issue.
Although food embargo proposals
are certain to create much discussion
few leaders are inclined to believe that
any of them will be enacted into laws.
Representative Kitchin r thinks, too,
that investigation of the high cost of
living will be left to the executive de
partment It is regarded as doubtful that any
