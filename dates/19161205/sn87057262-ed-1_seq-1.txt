First Demonstration Jnited States Occured is Capitol
Today as Mr ilson Was Reading Speech
'[Uniivid Press Leased Wire Service]
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5—The first demonstration by suffragists such as heckled
the British house of commons in the past, occurred in congress here today while President
Wilson was reading hfa
message to a joint session of the house and senate.
Soon after the president had started speaking, a big yellow silk banner was unfurled
from the house gallery, by a group of suffrage sympathizers. It bore the inscription:
"Mr. President, what will you do for woman's suffrage?"
The banner was about four feet square and of yellow silk, with the lettering in black.
A page was dispatched hurriedly and tore down the banner. The president went on
with the reading of his speech, apparently giving the banner no attention, though it was
unfurled directly in front of him.
The women who unfurled ^he banner were: Mrs. John Rogers, of New York, chairman of the national
advisory committee of the congressional u/ilon Mrs. William Colt, New York, representative of council, Mrs. F.
Bayard Hllles, of Wllllngton, chairman Delaware branch, and Mra. Anna LoWensburg.
The appearance of the. banner created decided stir among tbe senators and representatives on tne floor
and the crowds Jamfnlng the galleries, gasped In amazement. Foreign djplomata turned curious eyes upon the
fluttering piece of silk.
Officers appeared Immediately In the gallery and stood alongside the front row In which the women who
urifurled the banner were sitting. They did not make a sound and were not ejected.
The unfurling of the banner haw been carefully planned. Immediately after the demonstration, pampnetts
were passed out by women In the corridors giving printed details of Just what happened In so far as the women
were conoerned. This prlnfed information Included the names of the women who unfurled the banner.
Jamea Griffen, a page, went down In history aa the youth to drag down the first suffrage battle flag un
