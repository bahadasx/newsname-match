-Majority Lender Kitchin joined with
the speak-r in en-claring that the usual

pensed with and an earlier meeting
than noon, probably ) o'clock, set. No
active opposition to the early meeting
hour has appeared, but there is some
dissension over tne proiw.sed ahohlion
of the Christmas holidays. A cum-j-ronuse
holiday of one week, begin
ning the Saturday before Christmas,
has been suggested.
Although fot.J embargo proposals
are certain to create much discussion,
few leaders are inclined to iie-lieve that
. any of them will be enacted Into laws.
Representative Kitchin thinks, too. that

LONDON, Dec. 4.! )ocuments ' re
ceived here give the text of the reply
of tlcneral vein Pissing, military gov
ernor of Belgium, to Cardinal Mer
cier's letter of October P.I. and the car
.linal'ii rejoinder of Novembe r 10.
Ocneral von Hissing's rejely, daleel
October 21, begins by denying any vio
lation of the assurance- given ceim
manelers at the beginning of the war
that no men would be removed from
Belgium, eleclaring that stnli re
movals had been justified by the
eland, stiue emigration of large num
bers of young men wishing to join tl
Belgian army." He adds:
"The (lerrnan anlhorilies would
have been quite justified in following
the example of Lie-land anil France,
hut they have not done so."
Conlending that the employment of
Belgian unemployed in Germany has
nothing to do with the coiiiluit of the
war. but is purely a soc ial and eco
nomic measure. General von Hissing
says:
"Great Britain's merciless ece.nomlc
isolation of Germany bears o. pi. illy on
Belgium: bringing u state of
public calamity to Belgium."
General von Bissmg then declares
thai the He-fgian pe-ople re-aliye-l the
state of affairs and that tens of thous
ands of them have gone to Germany
voluntarily, where they could get
belter pay. otheis would follow, be
sa s. but are deterreel by influence
systematically brought to bear on
them. He invites the cardinal to study

The document, after reciting the as

"The allies only stipulated that the
Germans should etnmlly draw no ad
