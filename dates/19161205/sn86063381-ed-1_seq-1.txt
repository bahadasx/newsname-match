By ROBERT J. BENDER
United Press Staff Correspondent)
Washington, Dec. 5.Declaring
the country cannot and should not
consent to remain further exposed to
profound industrial disturbance,
President Wilson today appeared be
fore a joint session of congress and
V, appealed for
actionofupon +he settlementimmediate and regulation dif
ficulties between railways and em
ployes.
Following the precedent he estab
lished when he first assumed his ex
ecutive duties in the White House,
President Wilson today appeared be
fore congress and personally outlined
legislation he hopes to have enacted
by that body It was the third time
he has addressed the sixty-fourth
eongress
Because the makeup of the next
housle may result in hard sledding
for Democratic measures, the presi
dent hoped, by his appeal today, to
convince this congress of the import
ance of immediate action on legisla
tion he particularly desires.
^*The executive box in the house gal
lery was reserved for Mrs. Wilson
and other members of the president's}
family. Members of the cabinet also
were there.
While congress is working on his
recommendations the president will
Tbe away from Washington but little
Should it be necessary he may recom
mend that the customary Christmas
recesd be dispensed with. This sug
gestion has been made already by
Speaker Clark and Chairman Fitzger
ald? of the house appropriations com
ittee
There is much to do before March
3, the date of adjournment, if the
president's wishes are to be carried
out in full at this time and not en
trusted to the sixty-fifth congress.
The first demonstration by the E*uf
fragists, such as heckled the British
house of commons, occurred in con
gress while the president was read
ing his annual message. Soon after
he started to read his) address a big
yellow banner was dropped by the
suffragists from the gallery with the
inscription, "President, what will
you do for woman suffrage?"
President Wilson's address is as
follows: Gentlemen of the Congresis:
In fulfilling at this time the duty
laid upon me by the Constitution of
communicating to you from time to
time information of the state of the
Union and recommending to your
consideration such legislative meas
ures as may be judged necessary and
expedient I shall continue the prac
tice, which I hope has been accept
able to you, of leaving to the reports
"A*%? several heads of the executive
departments the elaboration of the
detailed needs of the public stervice
and confine myself to those matters
of more general public policy with
which it seems necessary and feas
ible to deal at the present session
of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time
under which you will necessarily act
at thtei session and shall make my
suggestions as few as possible but
there were some things left undone
at the last session which there will
now be time to complete and which
it seems necessary in the interest
of the public to do at once,
In the firsit place, it seems to me
^ratively necessary that the earli
possible consideration and action
*/ould be accorded to the remaining
measures of the program of settle
ment and regulation which I had oc
casion to recommend to you at the
close of your last session in view of
the public dangers disclosed by the
unaccommodated difficulties which
then existed, and which still unhap
pily continue to exist, between the
railroads of the country and their
locomotive engineers, conductors and
trainmen. n*\then recommended:
vSt, immediate provision for the
Jgement and administrative re
anization of the Interstate Com
erce commission along the lines
embodied in the bill recently passed
by the houete of representatives and
now awaiting action by the senate
'in order that the commission may be
enabled to deal with the many great
fanji various duties now devolving up
fon it with a promptness and thor
tougnneste which are, with its present
constitution and means of action,
ractically impossible.
I ll
Second, the establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basKs
alike of work and of wages in the
employment of all railway employes
who are actually engaged in the
work of operating trains in inter
state transportation.
Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
sults in experience of the adoption
of the eight-hour day in railway
transportation alike for the men and
for the railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the
congress of the consideration by the
Interstate Commerce commission of
an increase of freight rates to meet
such additional expenditures by the
railroads as may have been rendered
necessary by the adoption of the
eight-hour day and which have not
been offset by administrative read
justments and economies, should the
facts disclosed justify the increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the ex
isting federal statute which provides
for the mediation, conciliation and
arbitration of such controversies as
the present by adding to it a provi
sion that, in case the methods of ac
commodation now provided for should
fail, a full public investigation of
the merits of every such dispute
shall be instituted and completed be
fore a strike or lockout may law
fully be attempted.
And, sixth, the lodgement in the
hands of the executive of the power,
in case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such
rolling stock of the railways of the
country as may be required for mili
tary use and to operate them for
military purposes, with authority to
draft into the military service of the
United States such train crews* and
administrative officials as the cir
cumstances require for their safe and
efficient use.
The second and third of these
recommendations the congress imme
diately acted on it established the
eight-hour day as the legal basis* of
work and wages in train service and
it authorized the appointment of a
commission to observe and report up
on the practical results, deeming
^hese the measures most immediately
needed but it postponed action up
on the other suggestions until an
opportunity should be offered for a
more deliberate consideration of
them. The fourth recommendation
I do not deem it necessary to renew.
The power of the Interstate Com
merce commission to grant an in
crease of raters on the ground re
ferred to is indisputably clear and
a recommendation by the congress
with regard to such a matter might
seem to draw in question the scope
of the commission's authority or its*
inclination to do justice when there
'S no reason to doubt either.
The other suggestionsthe in
crease in the interstate Commerce
commission's membership and in its
facilities for performing it* mani
fold duties', the provision fcr f'il
public investi^a+irn
of industrial disrates, and the grant
to the executive of the power to con
trol and operate the railways when
necessary in time of war or other
like public necessity I now very
earnestly renew
The necessity for such legislation
is manifest and pressing Those
who have entrusted us with the re
sponsibility and duty of serving and
safeguarding them in such matters
would find it hard, I believe, to ex
cuse a failure to act upon these
grave matters or any unnecessary
postponement of action upon them.
Not only does the Interstate Com
merce commission now find it prac
tically impossible, with its present
membership and organization, to per
form its great functions promptly
and thoroughly but it is not un
likely that it may presently be
found advisable to add to its duties
still others equally heavy and-exact
ing. It must first be perfected as an
administrative instrument.
The country cannot and should
not consent to remain any longer
exposed to profound industrial dis
turbances for lack of additional
means of arbitration and concilia
tion which the congress can easily
and promptly supply. And all will
agree that there must be no doubt as
to the power of the executive to
make immediate and uninterrupted
use of the railroads for the concen
tration of the military forces of the

motor to Bemidji to attend the fes
tival will get the price of a railroad
ticket provided that his purchases
amount to the required sum.
Refund sheets can be secured at
refund stores or at the Pioneer office.
