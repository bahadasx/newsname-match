same work is to be taken up In Ard
more, with the hopes that a commodi
ous and worthy structure may In the

They cannot eerve con

Bel: ntlou
present divisional commander.
In the opinion of officers of tho

consider it. was made even more un
welcome by the action of General
O Uyan in h aving the field before tho

LIST OF BAD. MEN WHO ARE

GRADUALLY GROWING.

Another killing was added to the
list cf thifce that have occurred at
Kagtown since the opening of the
oil fields when Frank Jones shot
Roy McCurtaln through the head
while the latter was attempting to
"High Jack" a place in the oil field
metropolis.
For the benefit of those who may
not know what the term "high Jack"
means let it he explained.
If a person possess a certain ar
ticle that a certain other party tie
sires to possess, and the latter does
not care to go through the formality
of offering current coin of the realm
for the same, he simply takes a big
gun In hand, lays in wait along the
side f the road or enters the place
cf business of the one whom he has
eiil designs upon and at the point
of his artillery takes what he sees
In sight and gets away with it.
This is what took place last night at
Rugtown when McCurtaln entered
a place there and demanded all the
cash and other valuable articles In
sight at the same time pressing his
sreuntent with a big gun.
Frank Jones who chanced to be
pasing hy at the time observed hit
operation pnd concluded that Roy
h; d about rearh-d the end of his
roje. Jone enteteil a rear door and
nith deliberate a!m sent a forty-five

It Is alleged that McCurtaln has
been making a practice of this stunt
for some time and the officers here
state that his reputation was such
that it would not lie advlsahlo for
any one to take a chance with Mm.
Tho remains were taken to tlifc
