As a rnle, the soldiers who crowd
the Association centers refrain
from swearing, but soma men,
who have the habit of nsing pro

consciously, forget themselves.
When this occurs, a secretary or
some soldier quietly passes one
of the hint usually works, Some
times 'it is necessary to back up
the calrd by tho presentation of
paper and pencil, which never
fails to bring abont the desired
result.
