A STRONG STAND
TAKEN BY DEMOCRAATIC COM
MITTEE FOR STATE-WIDE .
New Body Meets Here Monday And
Organizes By Electing Dr. W. B.
O'Bannon Chairman
Lincoln county Democracy is the
first in the state of Kentucky to come
out openly and avowedly for the
adoption of a state-wide prohibition
amendment to the Constitution of
Kentucky.
By unanimous vote and the approv
al of the chairman, the Lincoln Coun
ty Democratic Committee, elected
Saturday and formally organized
Monday, adopted a resolution favor
ing the submission of the state-wide
prohibition amendment and calling
upon all "democrats who love their
party, their state and their homes to
vote in favor of such an amendment
to the constitution of Kentucky."
The adoption of this resolution, is
hp first steD so far taken in Ken
tucky to commit the Democratic par
ty to a definite policy of support of
the state-wide amendment, without
-which a great many of the party
leaders believe their party is doomed
to defeat exactly as proved the case
in Tennessee as long as state-wide
-was an issue.
The election of a chairman and sec
retary was the only other business
coming before the meeting of th
committee here Monday afternoon
-which was attended by all of the 1."
members except two who were repre
sented by proxies. By a majority of
one vote Dr. W. B. O'Bannon was
elected chairman over J. N. Cash
The committeemen voted as follows
on the chairmanship contest:
For O'Bannon Committeemen P.
T. Parrish, J. C. Hays, R. Y. Ballard,
John Wentzel, R. B. Woods, Dr. J. T.
Morris and S. M. Owens.
For Cash Committeemen Stanley
Stephenson, S. M. Helm, A. P. Sloan,
R. M. Blackerby, E. G. Gilliland and
Jones Baughman.
S. M. Owens, of McKinney was
elected secretary of the committee.
The precinct elections held Satur
day attracted considerable interest,
where there were contests. The re
sults in the 13 precincts of the coun
ty were as follows:
Stanford No. 1 A. P. Sloan had
r.o oorifion for reelection as com
ro.t Mtn in this precinct which he
h r.irc sented for the past four
yeai's.
Stanford No. 2 R. B. "Woods de
fer ted John S. Baughman, by a good
sized majority.
Stanford No. 3 Dr. J. T. Morrif
defeated T. W. Jones by 0 majority.
Stanford No. 4 R. M. Blackerby
defeated J. H. Wright Sy 4 majority.
In both the Crab Orchard precincts
neither P. T. Parrish nor J. C. Hays
had opposition.
At Waynesburg R. Y. Ballard,
who has been committeeman for the
past four years had no opposition,
nor did S. M. Helm, who has repres
ented Turnersville precinct for four
years.
At McKinney S. M. Owens was
elected without opposition.
At Hustonville No. 1 Jones Baugh
man showed up with such tremendous
strength that all opposition to him
faded away. In Hustonville No. 2,
Stanley Stephenson was so strong he
was given no opposition.
At King's Mountain E. G. Gilliland
defeated D. C. M. Thompson by 12
majority.
At Highland John Wentzel defeat
ed D. R. Adams by one majority. In
this precinct friends of Mr. Adams
claimed that four republicans were
voted in the line-up against him, but
it is not thought that any contest will
be made over the election of Mr.
Wentzel.
As a whole the committee is a
splendid body of men and democrats,
and Dr. O'Bannon will make a chair
man who will be acceptable to every
democrat in the county, for he will
always be found on the right side,
and a fair, square deal for every man
is assured with him in the chair.
The resolution adopted In favor o
state-wide prohibition was offered by
Committeeman Blackerby, of Row
land, and reads as follows:
"Resolved, by the Democratic
County Executive Committee of Lin
coln county, assembled here in Stan
ford, Kentucky on this the 4th day of
December, 1916, that, recognizing
the evils of the liquor traffic and the
fearful ruin which the legalized whis
ky business has caused our nation,
our state and our homes, we desire to
go on record as most, heartily and
enmestly favoring complete aboli
tion of the liquor business through
state-wide and nation-wide prohibi
tion. We favor the submission of the
question of state-wide prohibition to
vote of the people at the earliest pos
sible legal opportunity, and when such
is submitted to vote of the people,
we urge upon all Democrats who iove
their party, their state and their
homes to vote in favor of such an
amedment to the constitution of
Kentucky. "
SHE'S COMING SURE, BOYS
Judge Charles A. Hardin, o." Har
rodsburg, Chairman of the Demociat
ic State Central and Exc:'itivo Com
mittee, has announced that he favors
the submission of a prohibition a
mendment to the people of Kentucky
at the earliest legal and practicable
moment, that the question may he
taken out of politics. He does not
think the Democratic State commit
tee have any authority, however, "to
suggest or shape the thoughts or pol
icies of the Democrats of the state."
This was in answer to a s:'gfa'est!on
that the committees urge the legis
lature to submit the amendment.
Edwin P. Morrow, of Somer.;of,
gave out a statement last week urg
ing the submission of a piohibhion
amendment at the earliest moment.
He will support it with all his povver.
he says.

DANGER SIGNAL
If the fire bell should ring would
you run and stop it or go and help to
put out the fire? It is much the same
way with a cough. A cough is a dan
ger signal as much as a fire bell. You
should no more trp to suppress it
than to stop a fire bell when it is
ringing, but should cure the disease
that causes the coughing, his can
nearly always be done by taking
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy. Many
have used it with the most beneficial
results. It is especially valuable for
the persistent cough that so often
follows a bad cold or an attack of
the grip. Mrs. Thomas Beeching, An
drews, Ind., writes: "During the win
ter my husband takes cold easily and
coughs and coughs. Chamberlain's
Remedy is the best medicine for
breaking up these attacks and you
cannot get him to take any other."

and they become tightly packed, liv

if tongue is coated, then give this de

it, and it can not cause injury. No
difference what ails your little one
if full of cold, or a sore throat, diar

should always be the first treatment
given. Full directions for babies,

HAYES MURPHY
A most unique and romantic
wedding took place at Mitchellsburg.
The spot selected for the occasion
was a beautiful little woodland, near
the home of the bride. There in God's
open country with no canopy but the
heavens, with the sun now and then
peeping from behind the clouds
smiling upon the scene and no sound
heard but the woodman's ax; in the
hush of that solemn occasion sur
rounded with friends, Mr. W. G.
Murphy, of near Hustonville, and
Miss Loula Mae Hayes were united
in the holy estate of matrimony by
Rev. G. W. Hoffman. They left im
mediately for Danville where they
took the train for New Orleans to be
gone for the following week. Mr. and

Dry Sentiment Strong
As Shown By Precinct Elections All
Over State Saturday
The city papers Monday said that
in the selection of Democratic pre
cinct committeemen in Kentucyy
Saturday, the "dry" element of the
Democratic party was overwhelming
ly successful. A dispatch from Frank
fort to the Louisville Post said:
Frankfort, Ky., Dec. 4. The
strength and intensity of the feeling
that has been aroused against the
Stanley administration and what the
Democratic opponents of the State
administration call "liquor control of
the Democratic party" was shown at
the election of Democratic precinct
committeemen all over Kentucky
Saturday afternoon.
These precinct committeemen chose
the county committees in every coun
ty of the State for terms of four
years, and from sucn returns that
are in there seems to be no doubt
that friends of Senator Beckham and
Mr. Percy Haley have been victorious
in three-fourths of the counties of
the State, while in other counties,
anti-Stanley committeemen have been
elected, although not identified with
the organzation of Mr. Beckham and
Mr. Haly.
On the whole the election of pre
cinct committeemen indicates a
strong dry movement inside the Dem
ocratic party in the State, and many
State Democrats predict that the
Democratic party in the State, will
in the near future, show itself to be
as strongly favorable to the move
ment to submit a State-wide prohibi
tion amendment at the Legislature
of 1918 as are the Republicans since
the declaration of Mr. Hert, Mr. Has
well and others. The league of which
Dr. A. J. A. Alexander, of Wood
ford county, is chairman, and which
is working for a State-wide amend
ment inside the Democratic party,
undoubtedly exerted a large influence
on the election of committees Sat
urday. There are others who explain the
election of Saturday Avas as much a
desire of the State Democrats to re
pudiate the Stanley administration
and the Governor's pardon record as
an indication of an overwhelming
rush toward State-wide prohibition.
In Owensboro, lor Instance, the
Stanley men are beaten in every pre
cinct in the county, but the success
ful committeemen are neutral on the
wet and dry question.
In Owensboro the anti-Stanley, an-ti-Hager
men swept every precinct,
electing E. J. Greenwell, advertising
manager of the Messenger, city chair
man, over L. W. Haer, son of S. W.
Hager, and defeating Mr. Hager in
his own precinct.
In Henderson, Gov. Stanley's
home town, the "drys" claim a ma
jority, and in the Courthouse pre
cinct, where Governor Stanley votes.
Oscar Letcher defeated for precinct
committeeman John O. Byrne, a
strong Stanley man, who has been
committeeman for 35 years.
On the face of the returns the oi
ponents of the Governor have car
ried a clear majority of the precincts
in Franklin county, but the adher
ents of Governor Stanley and of Col
lector of Internal Revenue Marshall
are getting up contests. These con
tests will be heard in the first in
stance by State Executive Commit
teeman William F. Klair, of Lexing
ton. Mr. Klair won his own fight for
control of the party machinery at
Lexington.
Western Kentucky where the Dem
ocratic vote is very large, is report
ed to have e'ected precinct commit
teemen in almost every case opposed
to liquor control of party affairs,
and in many cases staunch advocates
of State-wide prohibition.
Reports received hei-e show some
remarkable victories for the anti-Stanley-"Dry"
forces.
The Drys led by Jonn T. Hinton,
j captured every precinct in Bourbon
In Graves county, Senator Frost,
one of the original "STate-widers,"
led the dry forces to an overwhelm
ing victory.
In Mercer, the anti-administration
dry men captured almost every pre
enct as they did in Henry, Spencer,
Lincoln, Trigg, Lyon, Caldwell, Lo
gan, Clarke and Lewis.
In Floyd the Drys won 12 out of
16, and in Lawrence they captured
a large majority and will elect M.
F. Conly, former Prison Commission
er, chairman.
"Big Chief" Vansant swept the
platter clean in Boyd county, while
the Drys led by B. B. Cozine and
Will Beckham captured twenty-one
out of twenty-two precincts in Shel
by county.
In Ballard, William Henderson led
the anti-Stanley men and scored a
victory in nine out of 16 precincts,
beating Henry Turner, Stanley's
brother-in-law, in his own precinct.
