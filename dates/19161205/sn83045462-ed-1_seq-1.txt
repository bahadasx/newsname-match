The address of the President follows: j ^
Gentlemen of the Congress:
In fulfilling at this time the duty laid
upon me by the Constitution of com- , 'n
municating to you from time to time j su
information of the state of the Union j co
| m
and recommending to your considera- i
tion such legislative measures as may j ha
be judged necessary and expedient, I j ca
shall continue the practice, which I j gt
hope has been acceptable to you, of j m.
leaving to the reports of the several to
heads of the executive departments the ? w
elaboration o. the detailed needs of the j*
public service and confine myself to as
those matters of more general public sa
policy with which It seems necessary
and feasibte to deal at the present session
of the Congress. da
1 realize the limitations of time un- wj
der whicn you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make mv sug- ^
gtsUons as few as possible; but there ur
were some things left undone at the ,Hj
iaht session w hich there will now be j
time to complete and which it seems j ^
necessary in the interest of the public j sJ(
to do at once. j m
In the first place, it seems to me i to
imperatively necessary that the earii- 1
e*t possible consideration and action! '
should be accorded the remaining j tQ
measures of the program of settle- ' fn
ment and regulation which i had oc- j ?Q
caeioft to re? ommend to you at the i ,
close of your last session in view of j
the public dangers disclosed by the un- j *.
a. . ornmodaied difficulties which then jK
existed. and which still unhappily con-j
tinue to *-xj;<f. between the railroads j
o. the country and their locomotive en- j

stponed action upon the other aug- 1
istions until an opportunity should i
i offered fpr a more deliberate con- i
iteration of them. The fourth recom- ! '
endation I do not deem it necessary ; ;
renew. The power of the interstate '
rnmerce commission to grant an in- '
ease of rates on the ground referred
is indisputably clear, and a recomendation
by the Congress with regard ,
such a matter might seem to draw
question the scope of the commison's
authority or its inclination to do

f'll.t either. j

Necessity Pressing and Manifest, j
The necessity f<>r sucl) legislation is]
anlfest and pressing. Those who have 1
itrusted us with the responsibility j
id duty of serving and safeguarding !
leni in such matters would find it
ird. 1 believe, to excuse a failure to j >
t upon these grave matters or any 1
unecessary postponement of action '1
x>n them. j<
Not only does the interstate commerce j,
mrnission now find it practically impos- j
ule, with its present membership and
ganization, to perform its great tunc
_?ns promptly and thoroughly, but it is';
>t unlikely that It may presently be ,
>uru? advisable to add to its duties still ,
hers equally heavy and exacting. It
ufct h.Jt be perfected as an administra- ! ,
ve Instrument. 11
The country cannot and should not con- :
nt to remain any longer exposed to pro-1
und industrial disturbances for lack of , '
iditional means of arbitration arid con- ' 1
liation which the Congress can easily ' J
td promptly supply. And all will agree ?

Unfurl Huge Banner While
President Wilson Is Addressing
Joint Session.
FLAG TORN DOWN QUICKLY
Woman suffrage advocates created a
sensation this afternoon while the
President was reading his message tc
Congress in the hall of the House, when
ux members of the Congressional
L'nion for Woman .Suffrage unfurled,
over the railing of the gallery opposite
the President, a banner bearing the inscription
:
"Mr. President, what will you do for
woman's suffrage."
There was instantly a thrill. If tlie
President saw the banner lie gave no
evidence of it. but nearly everybody
L*lse in the ohamWr craned his neck to
see it. James Grtffin, a page on the
floor of the House, reached up and
pujled down the banned, being assisted
n his long reach to the gallery by
congressmen and employes who lifted
lim.
In the meantime there was a scurryng
of Capitol policemen, who viewed
.lie banner a?* a sort of sacrilege. Two
>olicemen entered the gallery where
he women sat and remained there for a
ew minutes, as if read*' to arrest anyiody
else who produced an eight-foot
>anner. As the women had no more
=urprises concealed about them the
President was allowed to read his message
without any further handwriting
>11 the wall.
President Smiled Covertly.
.as me uanner Jiutterea 10 ine noor
n the grasp of the page perhaps the
President saw it out of the corner of
lis eye, for people close to the Presiient
say he smiled a little.
The women who held the banner were
llrs. John Rogers of New York, Mrs.
A'illiam Colt of New York. Mrs. Florence
Bayard Hilles of Wilmington,
Jel.: Mrs. Anne Lowenberg of Philaielphia.
Dr. Caroline K. Spencer of Colorado
Springs, and Miss Mary G. Feniall
of Baltimore.
After the President had left the
chamber members of the press gallery
rere ail supplied with written descripions
of the event, which had been pre>ared
several hours prior to the oc;urrence.
Galleries Filled Early.
House galleries were almost full when
.he regular session began today, an
lour before President Wilson was to
ippear before a joint session of Congress
to deliver an address.
Only about a score of men were
imong the spectators, women having
japtured most of the precious tickets
>f admission. The chamber was
ivarm, and one large woman in the
center gallery fanned herself furiousy.
Five persons were in the President's
jox. but none of them was directly
onnccted with the administration. Two
?ersons were in the diplomatic gallery.
Speaker Clark got the members down
:o routine business with difficulty. They
hatted and smiled at friends in the gaiety.
"If gentlemen want to talk let them
eave the hall!" the Speaker shouted.
About 200 members were on the floor
is the transaction of business began.
\ record attendance among members
,vas expected.
Greater precaution against persons
without proper credentials obtaining
admission to the galleries, public, private
and press, were taken today than
sver before. Many entrances which
ipon previous appearances of the
['resident were open were closed today.
The representatives of Japan, Sweden.
Colombia and Nicaragua were early ar-ivals
in the diplomatic gallery.
Arrival of Mrs. Wilson.
Mrs. Wilson, wife of the "President,
iu-companie/l by her mother, Mrs. lioliing,
arrived at 12:45. The folowing
cabinet ladies were in the 1'resident's
box: AJrs. Lansing, Mrs. Maker, Mrs.
Houston. Mrs. Gregory, Miss Wilson,
daughter of the Secretary of Labor,
and Mrs. John Skelton Williams and
Joseph K. Willard also were in the
executive gallery.
While the crowd was gathering William
J. Bryan slipped quietly into the
o if ice of Majority Leader Kitchin, just
outside the House lobby.
The President reached the Capitol at
12 .45 while the House still was in noisy
recess. H.e was ushered to the Speaker's
room to await the reception committee of
senators and representatives. At 12:55
the House reconvened. The memliers of
the Senate, headed by Vice I'resident
Marshall, marched over from the Seriate
wing and into the House chamber at
12
V ce I'resident Marshall was cheered
as he took his place on the right ot
Speaker < "i? rk. The Speaker appointed
to receive the 1'resident Representative
Kitchin, Fitzgerald. Garrett. Mann and
Fordm-y The Vice {'resident named
Senators Kern, Gallinger, Stone. Simmons
and Works. Secretaries Larising, Houston,
Baker, Wilson and Daniels also were
in the chamber.
Ovation for Mr. Bryan.
William J. Bryan, former Secretary of
State, took the House by storm by entering
just at that time. He had gone
to the Gapitol for the express purpose
:>r Hearing ine {'residents message,
and arrived there during the half-hour
recess ordered by the House to arrange
for the reception of the President. Mr.
Bryan shook hands with scores of his
friends in the House as they stood in
the Speaker's lobby.
As he entered the hall of the House
people in the galleries began to clap.
Then some of the democrats on the
floor set up a cheer, almost as loud as
the demonstration a few minutes later
for the President. Mr. Bryan took a
seat in one of the rear rows, next to
Representative Doolittle of Kansas.
President Greeted by Soar of Cheers.
The democrats hurst into a roar o(
c heers as the President entered the chamber
promptly at 1 o'clock. There was
scarcely a cheer or a hand clap from the
republican side, but the democrats .mora
than made up for this lack of enthusiasm

i President Wilson Has Hoi
Abandoned Idea of Letting
U. S. Workers Off.
SALARY QUESTION IS UP
President Wilson has not abandoned
;his purpose to try to work out a plan foi
a Saturday half holiday in the govern|
merit service all the year rout id, and expects
to take up the matter at his eariiesi
; convenience. lie has gone so far as t?
say that he is deeply Interested in tin
project and is satisfied that he will b#
able to arrange the Saturday half hol
iday before long.
The President's definite statement 01
his purpose to give Saturday half holij
days all the year to government workers
: who can be spared from their desks was
; made late yesterday afternoon to a corn'
mittee from the American Federation 01
| Labor, headed by Samuel Gompers, wh(
j called on various matters in which th<
. federation is Interested. Mr. Gompers
J mentioned the Saturday half holiday
! proposition as one in which the federation
felt much concern and sympathy.
Is Continuing- Investigation.
! The President's answer was that he
' tint, felt much interest and had beer
j investigating the working conditions
i in the departments. He had found, fron
' reports made to him, that it might b<
impracticable to apply the Saturday
half holiday all the year to branches
i of the Post Office Department and ir
'navy yards. He saw no reason, how
| ever, why the half holiday should b<
withheld from other departments when
its operation promised to be satisfac
torv, and he expected to try to worl
out plans that would be harmonious ii
all directions.
! ; It is understood that the Navy Dc
I partment has called to the President's
I; attention that to grant a half holiday
in navy yards wouid seriously himiei
the administration's preparedness activities.
In the Post Office Department, ais*
serious delay in handling the mail:
might result, according to the advic?
that Postmaster General Burleson ii
l understood to have given the President
, The President's statement regarding
the probability of granting the hall
1 holiday wherever practicable will be a
i source of great encouragement througl
. \ out the government service, and hun:
d reds of thousands of federal employes

j with intense interest.

' i distressful conditions of the ever-in- i

, j It is pretty definitely settled that the
President will appear soon before Con
gress and discuss with that body rec- i
ommendations for abating the condi- '
tions that now exist throughout the
I country, but it was not known today
} whether in liis address he will specifically
refer to the need of increasing
| I salaries by the government itself.
* j Industrial Pay Higher.
' ; The ['resident is cognizant of the fact
that In nearly all lines of industry
increases have been granted in wages '
and that the workingman is, in some '
measure, abb- to keep up with the cost ;
of living, while the government em- ,
ploye is not receiving an extra dollar's
income and is far worse off financially
than lie was many years ago. 1
Suggestions have been made that if j )
the attention of the President could be | ,
called to the conditions regarding pay!
by the government he might give the
weight of his influence to efforts in i 1
Congress to increase salaries. I
The clerks have strong friends in j <
Congress and it was thought today:,
that some of thes' congressional
friends may go (o the President before J t
liis special address to Congress and ,
lay the situation before him, in the (
, hope that lie may see fit to touch upon t
the government's failure to look after |
I its employes. i 1
