3sused the disastroui explosion in Ar
angel, Russia. about three weeks age.
KIaidreds were killed and wounded and
two Steamers were destroyed, according
to an ofecial Russian report
The disaster, according to local Rumsian
ifficialS, was directly responsible for the

Shouvaleff, the Russian minister of war,
was quoted as declaring the explosion
as "one of Russia's worst defeats."
The arrest of Gatter revealed the fact

aused by bombs placed on the ships to
,over extensive thefts.
These thefts amount to upward of
