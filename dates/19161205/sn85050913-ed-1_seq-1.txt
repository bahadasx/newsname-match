WEBSTER CITY

If Alt Bill* SUNDAY
Billy Sunday Has Taken Boston^ and
Dr. Bromley is Capturing
Webster City.
Billy Sunday has taken Boston,
and Dr. Bromley is capturing Web
ster City. It is not suggested that
the two men, or the two campaigns,
or* the two towns are on a par! But
it is certain that the aims of the two
efforts are absolutely the same, and
it may be suspected that Boston is
just as conservative as Webster City!
Boston is receiving Billy Sunday
•with open arms. The business men
of old Boston are in the campaign as
though Billy's business were the big
gest proposition that had ever invit
ed their brain or hand. In view of
the amazing success of the Sunday
evangelistic campaign in the con
servative city of Brown Beans and
Browning, Emerson and Mother Ed
dy, Webster City people will like to
read what a staid Boston religious
newspaper has to say on the man
and his campaign. Herbert Atchin
son Jump, (No, Billy did not christ
en the man!) writes as follows in
the current number of the Boston
Congregationalist:
"The common people heard him
gladly."
This is the supreme, outstanding,
Gibraltar-like fact about the relig
ious genius named Sunday who since
N iv. 12 has "been headlining the
newspapers of Boston. Be he prophet
or be be wizard, he captures the
crowd and holds them supine in the
hollow of his hand. His three con
gregations on his opening Sunday
aggregated 48,000 people, and 12,
000 were turned away. This multi
tude thrice covered the one and a
half acres of tabernacle floor space
with expectant responsive humanity.
The highbrow may contemn apd the
lowbrow may scorn, but the atferagfc
man said to Billy what Billy declar
ed Martin Luther would say to him
if Martin were permitted to return
to earth again, "Go to it, Billy!" In
each service Rev. William Ashley
Sunday addressed as many auditors
as the average preacher commands
in a year. Thus he did three years'
work in three hours. This is in it
self a marvel to be studied. Who
knows but it may be God's own spir
it moving down the aisles of time?
The second unmistakable, judg
ment-determining fact is that this
two-legged superabundantly human
Event named Sunday reasoned with
his more than four acres of folks
about ^righteousness, temperance and
judgment to come. It was religion
that he talked,' real manstrong re
ligion. He dispensed the kind of re
ligion that affects your treatment of
your cook or stenographer, that
sends you home to appreciate your
wife, that makes you ashamed of
your little or big hypocrisies," that
passeB merciless verdict on the way
you spend a dollar or kill an hour,
that has scalding epithets for sin
and the balm of Jesus Christ, the
Saviour, for every repentant sinner.
"I never heard a man," Secretary
Atkinson reports a foundry worker
saying to him at the Philadelphia
meetings, "who could tell me what
wa^ right and what was wrong like
Billy Sunday."
WHEN GOODNESS BECOMES
NEWS.
With his irruption into Boston
Christianity leaps exultantly from
the modest advertising columns of
page thirteen in the newspapers in
to all the emblazoned prominence of
page one. Religion in the guise of
Billy Sunday is news. "Goodness
ain't ever news," Mr. Dooley used to
assert. When this seething evange
list rises above the horizon, howev
er, the war for goodness becomes for
the time being the Great War, and
the star reporter is assigned the
story. Mr. Sunday's first day in
Boston was served up in the three
Monday morning papers most widely
read by thinking people to the ex
tent, respectively, of fourteen col
umns of text and one picture, fifteen
columns and six pictures, eighteen
columns and three pictures. They
are not singing any more, "Every
day'll be Sunday by and by." The
new version is, "Every day is Sun
day's now and here."
He arrived accordingly on the
roaring Twentieth Century Limited.
Zjsfek No other train would have been dra
matic enough. He was met "by a pa
rade. The South Station reeked
with people as though he had been
Presidential candidate. He began
his ministry for the souls of Boston
by seeing Harvard defeat Princeton,
at football. This was on Saturday.
We knew he would be at the game,
for the papers had told us so a fort
night earlier.
There were other and more ser
ious features to the crescendo of
preparation that introduced the
double of Mr. Sunday's arrival.
The bombardment of the throne of
heaven by 7,500 cottage prayer
meetings, the enlistment of helpers
and ushers by the thousand, the rais
ing of a guarantee fund equaling the
capital stock of & good-sized corpor
ation, the training of the great choir
that will serve the meetings in two
daily shifts, the picturesque erection
of the very wonderful tabernacle—
these have all been alluded to in our
columns. Each activity was, as the
sociologist would say, a "radiant
point" of interest from which
streamed far-flung influences favor
able to the campaign. It was con
sequently inevitable that the atmos
phere of all Greater Boston should
be electric with anticipation.
And what the base ball apostle
says of Boston after his first day's
preaching is not uninteresting:
"You can't beat Boston for open
mindedness, enthusiasm and appre
ciativeness. The audiences today
didn't miss a Biblical or historical
reference. Nothing got by them, in
curve, out-shoot or spit-ball."
They have begun to sing the fav
orite Billy Sunday song at the Tab
ernacle now. Homer Rodeheaver ask
ed the ministers to carry one refrain
of it alone the other evening, and
the persons did it with a mighty
bass vigor as though they had been
taught Billy Sunday songs in divin
ity school. It is not a hymn of the
ology, theology old or new. It is a
clear hymn-call to Christian service.
If it proves to be the musical keynote
of the campaign, as now seems like
ly, and if the campaign lives out the
spirit of its keynote, no one need
fear for the consequences of "Billy
in Boston."
"Do not wait until some deed of
greatness you.may do
Do not, wait to shed youc light
a a
To the many duties ever near you
now be true
Brighten the corner where you
are.
1
Some one far from harbor you may
guide across the bar
Brighten the corner where you
are."
ANNUAL MEMORIAL
SERVICE IS HELD
Large Number of People Attend
Service Given by Elks in
Their Hall.
A large number of people were
present at the annual memorial ser
vice held by the Elks in their hall
Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock. The
services were in memory of the fol
lowing Elks who have passed away:
H. J. Arthur, J. A. Berggren, W. D.
Bonner, R. I. Bossert, A. H. Counts,
Amos Crum, H. M. Dillon, P. T.

B. F. Snook, C. W. Soule, A. B.
Twining, E. B. Walton, R. M. War
fleld, Frank E. Willson.
Palms and flowers decorated the
club home. The memorial program
was opened by a prelude and proces
sional played by Mrs. W. H. Cook.
The Exalted Ruler, Melvin F. John
son, opened lodge and the invocation
was given by Rev. Harry F. Shook.
Following the roll call of the depart
ed members, Mrs. W. L. Macgoey
sang "Lead Kindly Light." This was
followed by two others—"The Lord
is My Shepherd," sung by Miss Mar
garet Chamberlin, and a piano se
lection, "Beethoven Sonata, "Pathe
tique," rendered by Miss Lillian
Smith. The memorial address was
given by Judge Lawrence DeGraf of
Des Moines, who was an able sub
stitute for George A. Wilson of Des
Moines, who could not be here be
cause of a recent death in his fam
ily. At the conclusion of the ad
dress, Mrs. Macgoey aird Miss Cham
berlin rendered the vocal duet—
"Whispering Hope"—and after a
song by the audience, the benedic
tion was pronounced by Rev. Shook.
The' Elks gave Judge DeGraf a fine
smoking set before his return to Des
Moines as a token of their apprecia
tion for his splendid address. 5^

EVERYBODY WILLING TO HELP.
Success of the Movement Seems As­
sured—Street Decoration

kind and plainly all are in sympathy
with the plan. The actual work of
decorating the streets will begin
slightly before Dec. 11th and the
streets are going to look so pretty
tjhat everyone in the city will want
to come down town and shop and
walk up and down.
Not all the .business men have
been seen in rejard to subscriptions

To Dim Auto Lights.
Stratford Courier: The problem
of dimming automobile headlights
has been solved by Prof. A. H. Ford
of the electrical engineering depart
ment of the State university in the
iavention of the "Totalux" dimmer.
This consists of a lens made in the
upper two-thirds of prism glass and
W
in the lower part of smooth glass.
This conserves all the light and
throws it on the roadway instead of
into the eyes of approaching automo
bilists, or against the trees along the
way.
"The Other Man's Wife."
On Thursday evening, Dec. 7, at
the armory opera house, the new
Gaskell & MacVitty production,
"The Other Man's Wife," from the
pen of Victor E. Lambert, will be
seen here for the first time. The
double standard of morals and con
duct, one for man, the other for
woman, is the theme. The story is
handled in a very fine manner, and
a vein of humor which runs through
out the piece relieves any tendency
of the story to become prosy. The
play is interpreted by an excellent
cast, and an elaborate scenic invest
ure goes to make the production
complete.
Graduates from Teacher's College.
Miss Eunice Lee, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. G. W." Lee, graduated last
week from the State Teacher's Col
lege at Cedar Falls. Students may
graduate at the end of each term, of
which there are three in a year. Miss
Lee has.completed the course at Ce
dar Falls- and has already secured a
position as teacher in the second
grade at Fairfield, la., having com
pleted the primary course at the
state normal. She will go to Fair
field in a day or two to begin her
new duties.

10 DMAIBES FOR
IKE STAY-AT-HOMES
That is What Gen. Logan Tells the
Boys at Brownsville—Under
the President.
According to the Iowa Guardsman,
published by the Iowa soldiers now
at Brownsville, Gen. Logan states
that members of the Iowa National
Guard who refused to take the oath
at Camp Dodge before the troops
were sent to Texas are still members
and cannot be discharged. The gen
eral declared at Brownsville that
the governor has no right to grant
a discharge to the men who stayed
at home, as the men are still under
orders of the president, regardless of
the fact that they would not take
the new oath, which all men who
came to the border took June 28.
The department also holds that
the president issued the call June
18 and that although the Iowa
troops did not receive the order un
til June 20, men who were discharg
ed after June 18 by the governor,
are still members of the Iowa nation
al guard. It is the contention that
as the president has power over al1.
state troops, the fact that he issued
the call on the 18th of June gave
the men over to his orders and the
war department automatically be
came the only power that could
grant discharges.
Men who were in the guard at the
time of the call can be discharged
on four reasons only, namely: expir
ation of enlistment permanent re
moval from state physical disqual
ification, and by order of general
courtsmartial.

BOYS STEAL ROOT
FROM TILL FUST
KAMAL BANK
Lad Slips Into Cashier's Booth at the
Noon Hour and Takes
$134.02.
Saturday noon between 12 and 1
o'clock most of the twelve and four
teen year old boys in town were In
their homes seated with their moth
ers and fathers at the dinner table.
Some of them Were helping the cook
ies and pies that had been baked
that forenoon to disappear as fast as
possible while mildly espostulating
mothers reluctantly cut the second
piece of pie or cut into that frosted
cake which had been baked for Sun
day. Not one of them at that horn
dreamed what might be going on in
a down town bank—the First Na
tional Bank—where at that moment
three little boys, two aged twelve
years and one fourteen, were robbing
the till in the savings' booth of
$134.02.
About 12:15 o'clock, at the hour
Miss Cunningham, savings clerk, is
at home for dinner, the bank was de
serted except for the two cashiers,
E. E. Mason and H. O. Cutler. Enter
two boys—Vergil Hurst and Odra
Barngrover. Each of these lads are
twelve years old and the Barngrover
lad exceptionally bright for his age
young Hurst approached Mr. Ma'
son's window and sparring for time,
asked for the daily paper of the
night before. It was procured for
him and Mr. Mason wept on making
out a note upon which he had been
engaged when the boy approached.
Young Barngrover busied himself
with the Christmas Savings litera
ture lying on the ledge in front of
the savings deposit window and
when Mr. Cutler came down to wait
on him, he said he did not want
anything, just wanted to read the
literature, so he was left alone at
some little distance from the oth
ers. The back door into the cash
ier's and bookkeeper's office was ajar
and the little fellow, who was fa
miliar with the arrangement of
things, evidently darted through the
half opened door and stooping, crcpt
into the cashier's booth, seizing the
cash which was available. There
happened to be less than $200 lying
out, and of this the Barngrover boy
took exactly $134.02. Then he slip
ped quietly out through the rear
door of the bank where Glenn lams,
aged fourteen years, the oldest one
of the boys, was stationed to watch
that no one came that way.
That was the end of that part of
the tale. The rest came later when
Miss Cunningham balanced her
books about 4 o'clock. She was
$134.02 short. After vainly endeav
oring to locate the amount, Mr. Ma
son suddenly recalled the instance of
the boys loitering about the corriders
during the noon hour, and started
out to look for them. He was un
able to find them. That evening
about 7 o'clock when on his way
down to the bank, in company with
W. L. Clifton, another bank clerk,
he spied the lams, Barngrover and
Hurst boys ahead of him. They were
clad in new coats and were carrying
parcels under their arms. Follow
ing them, they came to the Mercan
tile store, where one boy went inside
and the other loitered outside. Mr.
Mason took a short cut through the
grocery department to try and watch
the boy on the inside while Clifton
stood guard over the entrance. See
ing themselves evidently being
watched, the boys took fright and
disappeared through the rear door
of the Mercantile annex and ran
wildly north to the railroad yards.
The men gave chase but finally gave
up after a search of empty box cars
and the stock yards.
The sheriff was notified and at
once began a search. In the after
noon the lams and Barngrover boys
had entered the Boston Shoe &
Clothing store to buy some clothes.
They were questioned as to whose
boys they were and replied, "I am
Bill Cessna and this is my brother!"
This is where the names of the Cess
na boys were unjustly connected
with the robbery.
They bought their clothes and
paid for them, in no way rousing
the suspicions of Mr. Boynoff, pro
prietor of the store*
Early Sunday morning Sheriff
Nelson received a complaint from J.
M. Whitson of the disappearance of
his horse and buggy from the mar
ket square Bome time Saturday even­
V*
uygBMiijj
vV^.
ing between 7 and 8 o'clock. The
sheriff at once connected that in
stance with the robbery and after
inquiry found that the boys had been
seen driving east towards Blairs
burg. Telephone communications re
vealed that they had driven to
Blairsburg and spent the night in
the livery barn there. Early next
morning they had driven towards
Williams and some hours later the
horse and buggy had come back to
Blairsburg with the empty buggy.
The boys had turned the horse
around a short distance out of Wil
liams, starting it toward Webster
City, and footed it into Williams,
where they got on a freight train
Here was cool plotting. They
were living up to their Jesse James
stories and movie pictures of bank
robberies, train robberies and all
other plotted crimes. They were
covering up their tracks.
They were put off the freight at
Macey, having breakfasted at Iowa
Falls. Sheriff Nelson had been busy,
telephoning descriptions to towns
along the line near Ackley, for it
was surmised that the lads would
take the M. & St. L. passenger train
at Ackley and go south to St. Louis,
where the lams boy has a sister liv
ing. Therefore the Ackley sheriff
was on the lookout when he beheld
three boys coming east down the
railroad track about noon Sunday.
He and a bunch of high school boys
went out to meet the youngsters,
who ran in all directions, hiding in
the cornfields and trying to escape.
They were all caught, however, and
taken over to the Ackley jail where
Sheriff Nelson found them that night
and brought them back to this city.
Each boy had had a revolver on
his person, but the Barngrover lad
had lost his in the racd for liberty.
Each boy had a pipe and tobacco in
his pockets and each boy had about
$40 in cash upon his person. In al!
$119.00 was recoved by the sheriff.
The boys are now in the custody of
parents or guardians, awaiting the
judge's decision today—the first day
of the grand jury session.
This is one of the saddest stories
the Freeman-Tribune ever chroni
cled and the namea. of the lads have
been used for the protection of sev
eral other boys whose names were
unjustly connected with the affair.
That it is possible for three bright
young boys under fourteen years of
age to commit such a crime inside
this city of homes, churches, schools,
splendid libraries and influences for
good, is food for thought. Something
is at fault. Questionable moving
pictures and lurid dime. novels are
no doubt responsible for this partic
ular robbery the deliberate, cool
headed way in which the thing was
carried out shows that.
There are some other boys in this
city .about the same age and young
er who will go the same road unless
saved from the environment which
is responsible for the childish crime
committed Saturday.

The Hon. Frank P. Woods, con

While Hamilton county has none of
the fair ones to spare, such a good
catch as ^Ir. Woods should find lit-C
tie difficulty in landing a real prize.

the best and that some day he may jj

I_njte y^puf only objection is thatL

that I do considerably more Work,

that this is true because I am a bach-\

to make special efforts to follow the

Kindly give my regards to our"

One on the Preacher.
It was Thanksgiving day, about
30 p. m., when the preacher's
phone sent out a merry ring and put
ting the receiver to his ear he heard
voice that seemed to be trying to
conceal a laugh, say—"You folks
beat it up here just as fast as you
can." "You bet," replied the preach
er. "where is it?" "Oh!" said the
voice, "I have the wrong number."
Then the preacher heard another
voice in the room ask, "Who is it?"
and the reply,—"He won't tell any
more than I will." "Yes he will,"v
was the answer, "I am of
the church." "Well," was
the quick and cheery rejoinder, "this
is and if you have not had
your chicken come right up and we
will be delighted to have you take
dinner with us." The invitation was
so cordial and hearty, that for once
the preacher regretted his inability
to eat two dinners on the same day
for he knew that there would be
good cheer as well as good fare in
that home. Perhaps he recalled the
story of the darkey and the water
melon, and sighed because there was
too little preacher and too much
chicken.
