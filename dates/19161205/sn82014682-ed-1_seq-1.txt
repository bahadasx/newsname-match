States to have a1 supply of sugar
grown and manufactured at home, in
dependent of the sugar supply of the
rest of the world, is surely well illus
trated by the difficulties which the
nations of Europe are now experienc
ing In obtaining their sugar and tne
prices" which they have to pay for it,
under present conditions. Apart alto
gether from the question of revenu.
the sugir tttuation today m Europe
(which would also exist in this coun
try, were it ret for the domestic sup
ply) should surely present to all think
ing people the strongest kind of an
argument in favor of continuing the
resent protective duty, without
4hich the eet and cane sugar pro
ducers of the United States cannot
exist under normal conditions. Aside
from arguments such as these, and
although the Democratic administra
tion, which reduced the duty and al
most removed it altogether, has been
returned to power, for another four
years, I believe that with the increas
ing national expenditures and the ne
cessity for retaining and enlarging
every source of government revenue,
wetiave no reason at any rate n the
mmpdiat future -to fear a return to
a basis of free sugar.

Scuth Beretania street
, R. W. Gaylord of the 'Hawaiian
Dredging Company was the first: per
son to see Mr. McLean's body after
- the death. Gaylori was coming down
' town when he made the discovery at
Hassinger street, near Pensacola. He
immediately notified the police and
Motorcycle Officer Sam Ferrelra
found the body still warm when he
arrived.
Deputy Sheriff Asch and Dr. George
F. Straub arrived shortly afterwards
but-too late to be of any assistance.
The body was taken home in the em
ergency hospital ambulance. Mrs. Mqr
Lean said that her husband had not
been feeling well for some time, but
went out as usual at about 5:30 this
mornlife for his dally walk. Dr.
Straub gives the cause of death as
heart failure and Deputy Asch says
that probably no Inquest will be held
or an autopsy performed.

tioua man in his many; duties with the
Inter-Island and the business cares
with which he was entrusted gave
him no little anxiety.
Recently he had complained, though
only at times, of some pains around
his heart Yet his general health
seemed so excellent that the news of
his death was all the greater shock
to those who knew him.
Waterfront Shocked at Death
"Jimmy McLean dead? It can't be
true! Why. I saw him at work only
yesterday afternoon."
This is what nine out of ten water
front .' and shipping men said ' today
when they learned of the suduen
death from aneurism Of the heart this
morning of James L. McLean, vice
president of the Inter-Island Steam
Navigation Company, Ltd. -
Those who had known Mr. McLean
for a third of a century went around
in a daze. They had grown old here
and had seen him daily for decades.
They could not believe he had gone
out of the world. - Repeatedly they
said so. -' ; .
"Jim Mcfean was the squarest man
In Honolulu," said one man' grown
gray In the Inter-Island's service. "He
always was the same, with a courte
ous word for everyone. I never knew
him to get angry. He gave U3 all a
square deal every time."
Others - spoke along the same ' line.
They commented on his business . In
tegrity, his faithfulness to his work;
how he was always at his desk, how
he died in harness, closing his desk
for the last time at 5 o'clock yes
terday afternoon, going home cheer
ful and kindly, as he always did.
Offices Show Evidence of Grief
V. In the Inter-Island offices was mute
evidence of sorrow felt by Employes.
It was large tears which had fallen
on the linoleum floor covering in the
passageway between the offices. The
gfrl stenographers made no attempt
to conceal .their grief. They were
crying at 8 o'clock this morning when
they - learned the news: ' Among the
men the tame sorrow was manifested.
Dot so emotionally, perhaps, but ' it
was still there. They were grieving
as a soldier grieves for a comrade
