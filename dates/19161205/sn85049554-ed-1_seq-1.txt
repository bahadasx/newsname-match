German Vice Qomul Carlos Kettelson

Villa bandits. N6 official confirma

daughter of George Elmendorf, as un
officially reported. The Chipese charge
d'affaires called at the state depart
ment and asked for Information re
garding reports of the killing of
Chinese subjects in Chihuahua.
American .railroad men in Chihuahua
City are reported safe and were un
disturbed by the Villa forces. Because,
of this, reports to the state depart
ment suggest that stories of atrocities
were exaggerated.
The German consul at Manzanlllo,
whose name was not given, is reported
to" the department as having been kid
naped by the bandits and held-for ran
som. From the location it is thought
some independent band took him. Ac

London, Dec. 5.—An article predict

iSenator Van Law did not register but

the number of Germans who wish to
annex Belgium has shrunk, to almost
nothing.
Not-Sign of Weakness.
The Tageblatt says the fact that
Germany wants a business peace is a
sign not of weakness but of common
sens*. The Vossische Zeltung also
prints an article discussing the possi
bility of peace. It says:
"Probably Ambassador Gerard is re
turning to Germany with some peace
proposal." If such is the 5ase, the pa
per adds, America is an unsuitable me
diator, and it warns Germany to accept
the services of President Wilson only
as a messenger and not as an arbitra
tor.
Peaoe Sentiment Strengthened.
Berlin, via wireless to Sayville, Dec.
6.—Editorials appeared in all the

enced by recent military events in
Roumania and economic conditions in

umors of the British ministerial crisis
which is impending. The VosBische

"We all feel the end Of the war has
been brought considerably nearer by
the events of recent weeks. Even
statesmen seem to redognlae this, al
tho their words laotf'.clearness."-
The' Vossische 2&itung says peace
negotiations ,werV not, discussed seri
ously in the Unitefl-'Statesr until Great
Britain's plight became apparent and
that' this was not a coincidence, but
was due to the Ahglo-Amerlcan sollda

"We ought".never to forget that it is
to the interest of the United States to
support Great Britain's position-for its
own sake at the^end of the war. In

Mr. Archbold's death followed aa Ill
ness of less than two weefts. He un
derwent an operation Nov. 2t, and for
a time seemed to rally. Later he suf
fered a relapse, and the five physicians
attending him decided that, blood

pose of influencing favorable legisla

ter.

John D. Rockefeller tells In his "Ran

met Mr. Archbold. jn stopping at a
hotel. Mr. Rockefeller was struck by
the fact that on the hotel register was
written In large character this lnscrlp

"John P. Archbold, {4.00 a Bbl." 1
"Four dollars a barrel," was Mr.
Archbold's battle cry. and tho he did
not succeed in putting crude oil up to
the figure named, he did succeed In ii
attracting the attention of Mr. Rocke
feller In a way that led to business as
sociation with the Standard's interests.
