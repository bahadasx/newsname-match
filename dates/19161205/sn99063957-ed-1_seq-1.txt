RUSSIANS FIGHTING

? ' ;
: Hope Rumanians Mav Bu Able To Hold Invaders in Check
Along Argeshu Rive; for Few DavsRussians Making
Desperate Effort to Creak German Lines in Trotus Valley
. .... and Cut German Railroad Communications Little Fight-
: ing at Other Points '
- "' . .
- London, Dec. 5. There is
, : -will be saved. Military experts today hoped that the
; Rumanian-Russian forces now defending the capital to
: the south, along the Argeshu river could hold the heavily
: reinforced invaders in check long enough to permit of a
' few more days of pounding by the Russians in the Trotus
' river valley.
A break in the German line at this point would put the
- main railroad line from the north to Kronstadt under
serious menace. It is this line on which the German
; forces in all of East Transylvania are depending for the
: major 'portion of their supplies. If the Russians can
: wrest it from-Teutonic control the German army in
; Transylvania must seek a readjustment of its lines. Real
ization of this fact is causing the Russians to redouble
their efforts at penetration of the German lines in
Gyimespass. v
Experts were inclined to doubt that the Germans
had yet brought lip heavy artillery of sufficient range to
. shell Bucharest from their position less . than a dozen
miles to the south. .
It was still noted here with satisfaction that even the
- German official statements with their claims of sweep
.' ing victory, do not cany news of capture of any consider
able portion of the Rumanian army. .. The number of
prisoners has been large, of course, but not so big as to
' suggest "anything more than an orderly retreat, by the
Rumanians. ' - '

mended the erection of a coliseum to
cost approximately $125,000 and with a
seating capacity of 6,000.
Among the other things recommended
were a woman ' building to cost (40,000,
iu which will be Jioused the art and tex
tile exhibits and reHt rooms, fire equip
ment consisting of a Ford chemical fire
engine and two hand chemicals at a cost
of about $2,000, and. as an inducement
for making the fair still more attractive
he urged the appropriation of $25,000
for premiums instead of $15,000.

Total resources of Portland banks, ac
cording to a report filed with Superin-
tenUent of Hank Sargent, amount to
$110,000,000 in round numbers at the
close of business November 17. This
sum is au increase of $21,000,000 over
tlie total resources tor the pat year and
au increase of $13,500,000 in the past
two months.
The deposits in the past J'car have in

banks is $$9,009,400. The cash reserve
is $8,500,000,-with an increase of $2,
500,000 iu the past two mouths.
The cause of the increase in the de
posits in the result of country banks
depositing with the Portland institu

fanners and stockmen on account of

large balance duo to the country banks

RECONSTRUCTION
OF
IN
England's Cabinet Crisis Will
Result in Compact War
Council
BODY OF NOT OVER FIVE
TO HAVE FULL CONTROL
Main Trouble Is Asquith Who
Wants To Be at Head of
Everything
London, Dec. 5. "England recon
struction" of her government, now in
process, must be taken as emphatic ro
iteration of Britain's determination to
fight the war to a finish. In all tie
maze of discussion of what sort of "re
construction" was being framed, this
fact stood out today.
Tho cabinet crisis was precipitated
by public demand voiced by the cab
inet member admittedly closest to the
public, David Lloyd-George for more
vigorous conduct of the war; for more
compact organization to direct Eng
land s energies against Prussinnism;
for construction of responsibility and
power. "
It was conceded today that out of
tho "crisis" would como organization
ot a compact war council probably
of not more than five members to be
given supreme control in the direction
of England's war energies. Whether
this would menn n rliango in the per
sonnel of tho cabinet or simply desig
nation of certain members of it to act
as the new council was a matter of
speculation. - London newspapers held
41. Mn. ,114-4-1.. i.llw !m 4V.a u... u4. I
the main- diffh-ultr in the way of set
tlement of the -matter arose through
Premier Asquith 's feeling that, as
prime minister, he should be chairman
of the new war council.
Asquith is known as one of the great
est " pacificistcrs" and 'plaentors" in
British politics. Ho has until Thursday
and possibly until Monday o exerciso
this ability tho house of commons hav
ing adjourned uutil Thursday in re
spect to his wishes, thus staving off
formal announcement of any "recon
struction" until that time. Many mem
bers are in favor or a still longer post
ponement until Monday.
Thero was no confirmation of a wide
spread rumor that Asquith had deter
mined to resign, but it was believed
he would do so rather than become a
mere figurehead with Lloyd-George In
practically full chargo of the conduct
of tho war.
ncss and thoroughness which nre, with
its present constitution and means of
action, practically impossible.
necond, the estamishmnnr or an eight

Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
sults In experience of the adoption of
he eight-hour day iu railway transpor
tation alike for the invn and for the
railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con-
cress of the oonsiilcralion py the in
terstate Commerce commission of an
increase of freight rates to meet such

roads us may have been rendered nee-
cssaiy by the adoption or the eight

and economies, should the facts dis-
lof.ed justify the increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal statute which provide for the
mediation, conciliation, and arbitration
of such controversies as the presentj
by adding to it a provision that, in
case the methods of accommodation

E
Lack of Thrill In Evidence
on Previous Occasions of
the Kind
IS CLEAN UP PROGRAM -WITH
PLENTY OF WORK
May Deliver Special Message
On Remedy for Exorbitant
Prices
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Proas staff correspondent.)
Washington, Dee. 5. Declaring the
country "cannot and should not consent
to remain any longer exposed to pro
found industrial disturbances," Presi
dent Wilson appeared before a joint ses
sion of congress ' today and appealed
for immediate action on his nrosram of
"settlement and regulation of diff leni
ties" between the railroads and their
trainmen.
Statement of the need of such legisla
tion occupied the bulk of his annual
message the shortest one ho has deliv
ered. It recommended passage of the
provisions included but not acted upon
in his last special apepnl last August.
At that time a nation-wido strike neces
sitated congrossiofial action.
in a lato addition to his message, tho
president urged the passage by the
house of the vocational and industrial
education measures passed by the sen
ate during the last session.
vino-thnll and dramatis tension o
noticcablo in the president's three pre
vious Visits to the Hlxty-fourth congress
wore lacking today. Crowds thronged
the cnpitol, however, and bun before
the session was scheduled to eoaveo0'alt
gallery entrances were besieged with
men and women; endeavoring to work
their way past the guards.'
Admission was by card only. ,
There were no staggering national de
fense regulations, such as features the
president's message a year ago.- Thero
was no note of war, such as threatened
in the socond message, reporting tho dis
patch to Oermany of a virtual ultimat
um following the Sussex sinking. Nor
was there the pressing need of speed
and quick decision reflected in tho re
quest for congressional action to avert
a nation-wido railroad strike last fall.
lhe message today constituted a
"clean up" program.
Although both branches of congress
are seething over the high eost of liv
ing problem and interest in this has
overshadowed all other proposed action.
the president made no reference to it
today. He is receiving, rvporis from
different executive departments, how
ever, in au effort to advise the bcsl
possible plan for tho curbing of soaring
prices.
It is believed the president will either
deliver a special message on the ques
tion later or take it up personally with
the house and senate leaders when u
plan he deemed feasible has been found.
So serious does the president regard
the high eost of living question that he
lms determined to keep it out of poli
tics if possible.
He is understood to feel that republi
cans and democrats are equally interest
ed in a solution of the difficulty and
will niako no effort to put through a.
party measure.
TO ABOLISH ELECTORAL COLLEGE
Washington, Dee. !. Abolition of
the electoral college and election of
president and vice president by direct
vote, was asked In a resolution offered
by Senator Shafroth today.
The bill also provides for increasing
the terms of tho president and vico
president to six years.
Tho bill was referred to tho commit
