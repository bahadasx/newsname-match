One of the reasons for the league's

This program calls for; a , legislative

than $40,000 has been subscribed for
use In the promotion of legislation fa

UNIVERSITY CLUB
TO HAVE HOME IN

Purchase of Thomas L. Wat
son Residence PracticaUyv
Agreed Upon.
The Board, of Governors of the
University club virtually has decided
upon the purchase of the Thomas li.
Watson " residence, 232 Golden Hill
street, with its extensive grounds and
big building-; as the - nucleus of a
permanent home.
The location, almost opposite the
present University club building,
which will be utilized by- the Young
Women's Christian association as a
site for the new building already
planned .by New York architects, was
originally the homestead - of the late
Hanford Xyon.
Negotiations for the , purchase have
been tentatively completed and pres
ent plans include thorough renovation
of the exterior as well as the interior,
enlargement by a brick addition for
squash courts and gymnasium, and
enlargement of the present structure
for dormitory purposes. . .
It is estimated that in the new
building even more space for dormi
tories, etc., will be available than in
the present quarters.
The purchase of the Watson prop
erty is not contingent upon the ac
ceptance of the" old club house leases
by the Y. W. C. A. and it Is likely
that the change will ; be inaugurated
prior to July 1 of next year.

Coroner's Finding Puts New
Aspect on Slaying of War
ren St. Merchant.
SHOT FIRED BEFORE
MRS. GARON SCREAMED
Cavanaugh, Witness For
State, Is Sure to Escape
the Rope.
Coroner John J. Phelan, in his find-r
lng of the causes which led to thei
death of Nathan Garon, clothing store
keeper, who was. shot to death by
highwaymen in his store, 246 Warren
street, states that Edward Slattery
fired the shot which killed Garon, and!
comes ! to the conclusion that he met
his death as a result of the "criminal
acts" of Slattery, Henry W. Welch!
and John Cavanaugh. All three have
been arrested .charged with murder
and Cavanaugh has made a confes
sion, . implicating his two companions
in tne Killing. t
The coroner's verdict which today
was turned over to Prosecuting. Attor
ney Alexander I DeLaney greatly
changes the previous aspect of the
case and the reported circumstances
of the killing. Slattery was alleged
to have fired the shot, after Gaxon's
wife had entered the store from her
home, and screamed in terror at the
sight of her husband being held up
with a gin. ; ' V :
The finding of the coroner reveals
the tragedy as a cold blooded, "delib
erate killing' Garon . having been" shot
down before ' his wife screamed and
immediately after the men entered the
store. . From evidence in the posses
sion of .Coroner Ph elan it appears that
on the night, of Nov. 25, Slattery and
Welch entered the store, while Cav
anaugh ; stood outside. Garon was
talking to his wife, when the alleged
murderers entered, and was not in
the rear of the store as has been un
derstood. ,
Welch carried'- a gun. and a club,
while lattery was armed , with a re
volver. Accoring to the coroner Slat
tery walked up to the store keeper and
said,- "Keep still or. I'll blow your head
off," following this remark Immedi
ately "without saying or doing more"
by placing .his gun. in the. pit of Ga
ron's stomach, and discharging the
weapon. ! ' " ' - ' V'
The . evidence .continues the find
ing, "failed to disclose any lawful rea
son ; whatever or .: justification for the
shooting and subsequent death of the
deceased." ' " ' '
' That 'Slattery was not excited by the
cries of the dead man's wife, that she
did not,, scream until -after the fatal
shot Was fired, and the evidence that
Slattery shot Garon to death without
resistance on the latter's part, mean
In the opinion of "the authorities that,
all three men can be held for the kill
ing.; The fact that Cavanaugh has
turned State's evidence, however, will
save him from being Jrled for first
degree murder, the charge against his
companions, according to, the police.
The shot which caused Garon's death
entered the , abdomen, contusing the
right kidney,- - fracturing the spinal
column where it lodged, and injuring
the spinal cord." The shock to the
spinal cord resulted in death. '

Long Distance Telephones

of Their Marriage, v
(Special to The Farmer.) ;
Stamford, Dec. 5- Long distance
telephone messages this : morning,
following a brief telegram last night,
brought to the astonished parents of
pretty 19-years-old Epiphany Sorgi,
a typical -Italian, beauty, the news
that she had been , married to T.
Henry Kenny, a Bridgeort real es
tate dealer. V,
Beyond the . fact - that the young
people were good friends, the parents
knew nothing of their budding ro
mance, and when the news of their
wedding came, last night, they were
astonished.
Kenny,, who is 22 years of age, and
his bride-to-be left Stamford yester
day afternoon, presumably for an auto
mobile ride. When they did not re
turn ,the parents of the young woman
became alarmed, fearing an accident
had befallen the v young motorists.
Their fears gave way to genuine as
tonishment, when, late in the evening,
they received a brief telegram an
nouncing the fact that the daughter
had married.
In order to avoid the entangle
ments that would follow owing to the
girl's youth, had they applied to be
married in Connecticut, they crossed
the state line, ' into Port Chester,
where the knot was tied. Then they
motored back through Stamford,
not stopping, and continued on to
New Haven.
It was from New Haven that the
telephone messages began to come to
friends here this forenoon.
. .Mrs. JKenny is the. daughter of Dr.
Anthony S. Sorgi, who has a large
practice in both New York and Stam-.

preliminary report on the basic sub
ject of main arteries.; In such event
the Brdad street extension and the
continuation of John street . from
West avenue to Park as advocated by ;
Mayor Wilson, will not be- sanctioned
by the planner.-. ;
In fact it is known that Mr. Nolen
irrespective ' of " what his final report

than easterly or northerly.
In view of the contemplated im-,
