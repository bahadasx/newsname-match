WHAT TESTING OF COWS
:ff-lMtiltt SHOWS
I OWNER OF THE THE HERO
I I The Welsvllle Cow-testing Assocla-fli-.((m
has completed Its third mqntbB
I work. This month 381 cows out of
I 483 were on test. Of this number
H four cows inado over 60 pounds of
I fat for the month, white 16 cows
H made over forty pounds and 56 over
H thirty pounds of butter fat for the
H month.
H Mr. John L. Green's, 8-year old
I grade Jersey, loads In butter fat pro
I ductlon for the month with a record
H of 60.5 pounds. This cow 1b In tho
H ' ioth month of her lactation t period
I and has made an average of' 47
H pounds of fat for the, tlirco months
H ' the has boon on test. Mr. John
I Stuart's grade Holsteln was second
B with 56.8 pounds of fat. Mr. Tom
I Darley takes third ,place for the
month with his grade 'Shorthorn
H with 50.4 pounds of fat.
I Mr. Thomas Bradshaw's Holstqjns.
I lead the nsoclatlon with a herd av-
I eragq' of 30. G pounds of fat. Mr.
I Bradshaw also has throe of his cows
I on the honor roll for the, month.
I Messrs. John L. and Elmer Kerr
i with their mixed, herd, tnko,. second,
I place with an averago of 28.8
pounds of fat.
I This month. 8 'more cows were sent
I over the butcher's block because, of
a tendency to produce more beef
I than butter fat.
I Since the last of September, Mr.
I D. A. Kerr, Mr. John Hendry and
I Mr. Albert Savage have bought pure
bred bulls. At present John L,
I Qreen, Mr. D. O. Nellsen and Mr.
m P. L. Peterson are all contemplnt-
lag the purchase' of first-class pure
bred bulls for the Immediate fut
ure. Members of the association who
are feeding hay alone are not get
ting as good results for the value
of the feed fed as are those who are,
feeding a balanced ration, "thirty
pounds of wet beet pulp per day for
overy ono thousand pounds of llvo
weight can be fed to good advan
tage. Also cows producing over 20
pounds of milk a day should, recelvo
a pound of rolled grain, for' every
four pounds of.iullk produced per
day. Besides this tho cows should"
bo fed all tho hay they will eat up
clean. Beet pulp Is a succlent food
and a good milk producer when fed
conservative. Grain at ?40 per ton
Is a cheaper food than hay at $18
per ton.
Tho.assocttlon average for the
month was 20.7 pounds of fat per
cow, this is 42 pounds less than last
moritli's average. Tho average per
cowf.of the ton best herds with over
four, cows, on test was 27,41 pounds
as Compared, with 27. GC for last
mouth. t Tho average of , tho. ten
poorest herds was 15.-15 as compar
ed with 14.3 pounds for last month,
Tho .ayerago cow In the ten highest
herds mijde an average of 12.06
pounds of jat moro for tho 'month
than did thoap In tho 10 poorer
herds. The avorago cow In tho whole
asoclatlon was 5.75 ppundB higher
than the averago of the ten poorer
herds and 6.7 pounds less than the
average of the ten better herds.

Is duo, doubtless to two things, to
tho adaptation of such work to tho

to tho recent activities of tho Exten
