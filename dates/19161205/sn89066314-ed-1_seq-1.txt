WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. Declaring
the country "cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
,o profound industrial disturbances,"
President Wilson appeared before the
joint session of Congress today and
appealed for immediate action on his
program of "settlement and regula-
' -..- ..11! l,niinnn IViO mil
lion of diincuiues utinv.. w
roads and the trainmen,
statement of the need of such legls-
' ution occupied the bulk of his annual
message the shortest one he has de
livered. He recommended the pas
sage of the proWsions included, but
not acted upon, in his last speech in
August. At that time a nation-wide
strive necessitated congressional ac
tion. In a late addition to his mes
sage the President urged ihc pasage
by the House of the vocational and
Industrial educational measures pass
ed by the Senate in the last session,
fronds at Capitol Large.
The thrill and dramatic tension so
noticeable in the President's three
previous visits to the Sixty-fourth
Congress were lacking today. Crowds
thronged the capitol, however, and
hours before the session was sched
uled to com one all gallery entrances
were filled with men and women en
deavoring to work their way past the
guards. Admission was by cards
only.
The first demonstration for suffrage
smb. as "heckled the British House of
Gannons in the past," occurred in
Congress today while President Wilr
son read his annual message before a
joint session of the House and Sen
ate. As soon as President "Wilson
started speaking, a big yellow silk
banner was unfurled from the gallery
bearing in big letters the challenge
-Mr. President, What Will You Do for
Woman Suffrage?"
The message follows:
Gentlemen of the Congress: In ful
filling at this time the duty laid upon
me by the Constitution of communi
cating to you from time to time in
formation of the state of the Union
and recommending to your consid
eration such legislative measures as
may be judged necessary and expedi
ent I shall continue the practice,
which I hope has been acceptable to
you, of lcailng to the reports of the
several heads of the executive de
partments the elaboration of the de
tailed needs of the public service and
confine myself to those matters of
more general public policy with which
it Beems necessary and feasible to deal
at the present session of the Con
gress. I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my sug
gestions as few as possible; but there
ere some things left undone at the
last session which there will'now be
time to complete and which it seems
necessary In the interest of the pub
lic to do at once.
"Railroad Measures Necessary."
In the first place, it seems to me
imperatively necessary that the earl
iest possible consideration and action
should be accorded the remaining
measures of the program of settle
ment and regulation which I had occa
sion to recommend to you at the
close of jour last session in view of
the public dangers disclosed by the
unaccommodated difficulties which
then existed, and which still unhap
pily continue to exist, between the
railroads of the country and their lo
comotive engineers, conductors, and
trainmen.
I then recommended:
First, immediate provision for the
enIargcment and administrative reor
ganization of the Interstate Commerce
Commission along the lines embodied
ln the bill recently passed by the
House of Representatives and now
aiting action by the Senate; In or
w that the commission may be en
abled to deal with the many great
d "various duties now developing
Pon it with a promptness and thor
ghness which are, with its present
institution and means of action, prac
"caily impossible.
Second, the establishment of an

eight-hour day as the legal basis alike
of work and of wages in the employ
ment of all railway employes who
are actually engaged in the work of
operating trains in Interstate trans
portation. Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the President of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
sults in experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour day in railway trans
portation alike for the men and for
the railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the
Congress of the consideration by the
Interstate Commerce Commission of
an Increase of freight rates to meet
such additional expenditures by the
railroads as may have been rendered
necessary by the adoption of the eight
hour day and which have not been
offset by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the facts dis
closed justify the Increase.
Favors Government Investigation,
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation, and arbitra
tion of such controversies as the
present by adding to it a provision
that, in case the methods of accommo
dation now provided for should fail,
a full public investigation of the mer
its of every such dispute shall be in'
stitutcd and completed before a strike
or lockout may lawfully be attempted.
And, sixth, the lodgment in the
hands of the executive of the power,
in case of military necessity, to take
controFof such portions and such roll
ing stock of the railways of the coun
try as may be required for military
use and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft into
the military service of the United
States such train crews and admin
istrative officials as the circumstan
ces require for their safe and efficient
use.
Eight-Hour Day Established.
The second and third of these
recommendations the Congress Imme
diately acted on: it established the
eight-hour day as the legal basis of
work and wages in train .service and it
authorized the appointment of a com
mission to observe and report upon
the practical results, deeming these
the measures most immediately need
ed; but it postponed action upon the
other suggestions until an opportuni
ty should be offered for a more de
liberate consideration of them. The
fourth recommendation I do not deem
it necessary to renew. The power of
the Interstate Commerce Commission
to grant an Increase of rates on the
ground referred to is indisputably
clear and a recommendation by the
Congress with regard to such a mat'
tcr might seem to draw in question
the scope of the commission's an
thority or its inclination to do justice
when there Is no reason to doubt
either.
Would Add to Commission's Powers.
The other suggestions the increase
in the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion's membership and in its facili-
ties for performing Its manifold
duties, the provision for full public
investigation and assessment of in
dustrial disputes, and the grant to the
executive of the power to control and
operate the railways when necessary
in time of war or other like public
necessity I now very earnestly re
new. The necessity for such legislation
is manifest and pressing. Those who
le entrusted us with the respon
sibility and duty of serving and safe
guarding them In such matters would
find it hard, I believe, to excuse a
failure to act upon these grave mat
ters or any unnecessary postpone
ment of action upon them.
New Duties Call For More Power.
Npt only does the Interstate Com
merce Commission now find it prac
tically Impossible, with Its present
membership and organization, to per
form its great functions promptly and
thoroughly but It is not unlikely that
it may presently be found advisable to
add to its duties still others equally
heavy and exacting It must first be
