"Washington, Dec. 4. Today mark-'
ed foe beginning of tho end of the
Blxty-fourth congress an epoch malt
ing national legislative body. With
only three months of Its life remain
ing, the congreos at noon today open
ed its final session, confronted with
domestic and foreign legislative prob
lems of va3t moment.
Speaker Clark opened the final ses
sion of the house. With a quorum es
tablished, tho routlno preliminaries
wore rapidly disposed of. A commit
tee 'was named to notify the senate
that the house was formally In ses
eon and a tesolution passed notifying
tho senate that the house had formal-'
ly opened the session, and another
authorized the appointment of house
members on a joint committee to noti
fy the president that "a quorum of the
two houses Is assembled and that con
gress Is ready to Tecelve any commu
nication that ho may be pleased to
make."
Arrangements were then made by
the leaders for a Joint session of the ,
two house? to listen to the annual ad
dress of the president, who will ap
rear before the joint session tomoi
row. The senate settled down to the
work of the short session quietly and
disposed of tho routine of the opening
tession with rapidity. The vice pres
ident dropped his gavel promptly at
Boon, and the opening prayer of tho
cession was made by the chaplain of
the senate, the Rev. Forrest J. Pretty
man. A formal rollcall disclosed the
presence of quorum of the senate,
and a resolution was adopted to notify
the house tbat tho cenate had reas
sembled nnd was ready for business.
Both branches adjourned until
Tuesdav as a tilbuto of respect to the
late Senator Clarke of Arkansas.
Lcnlslatlve Program.
In the Iesilatlve program laid down
by President Wilson for the "shor
session." which ends March 4, time
will be the essence of the contract.
From tho first fall of the gavels in
house and penate at noon today the
national legislators began a flgiit
ngainst time and a dilvo for speed.
President Wilson is determined to
prevent tho disastrous consequences
of a general railroad tieup, and he
will go to almost any lengths to avert
an open break. Just what legislation
will he proposed to meet this strike
situation is 1 clear, but pros
Eiire Is already tiemcndous In Wash
ington for a general law enforce
Ing an Investigation of labor dispute
before a strike can legally be called.
Organized labor generally opposes
this plan, and will exert all Its power
ful Influence In congress to defeat any
euch proposals. The whole labor situ
ation throughout the country Is chaig
ed with explosive possibilities, which
111 considered or unwise legislation
might touch off.
The ambitious administration plans
Jer extending American foreign trade
aad equipping American export com
Baerce for the world trade war that
wMl follow settlement of the Euro
pean conflict call for extensive legis
lation. The start on this program has
already been made. The house at the
last session passed the Webb bill, ex
empting from the operations of the
anti-trust laws combinations of Amer
ican merchants and manufacturers
formed for tho sole purpose of engag
ing in the foreign trade. This meas
ure failed to pass tho senate, but will
be taken up in the upper house at
once
The legislative program also in
cludes a general foreign trade plan, a
complete code of neutrality laws, con
servation of resources, development
of wnter power on public lands, and
restriction of use of money In nation

A PROTEST
IS
Against The Loan Of JiHcflga
Bank TO China
New Deal With China Rouses
the Others Powers.
SUPPORT THEIR OWN BANKERS
Action Causes Surprise at Washing
ton, as It had Been Supposed That
the Foreign Bankers Are Acting ore
Their Own Initiative Present Loan
Arranged by Chicago Bank SeveraR
Times Oversubscribed.
Washington, Dec. 4. It became
known here that the British, Frenclt
and Japanese ministers at Pekln are
supporting the bankers of their coun
tries in protests to China against the
$5,000,000 loan arranged by that gov
trnment with a Chicaso bank.
Members of the former quintuple
group, which secured a practical mo
nopoly of Chinese loans for adminis
tratlve purposes through the loait
agreement of April, 1913, complained
recently in Pekln against the new
American loan on the ground that It
violated that agreement It had com
monly been supposed that the bank
ers were acting on their own initio
tive, and the information that thep
are beinir supported ty their govern
ments caused surprise at both the
state department and the Chinese le
gation, neither of which, boil ofltcTau
confirmation.
It is explained, however, that pra:
tically all loans or financial arrange
ments with Thina are liable to some
tort of complaint by other Interested
rartles, and I bat in the present in
stance every care was taken not to
violate previous agreements. Section
Yl of the agreement, which Is alleged
to have been violated, refers, It la
pointed oi't, to loans based on the salt
tax, while the present loan was sty
cured by the tobacco and wine taxe-o,
and to loans for administrative pur
poses, while the present loan Is far
industrial purposes. Therefoie, it i
not felt hero that there Is any goo3
basis for a protest, especially as n-ftJi
the coming of the European war tb.
quintuple group virtually was destroy
ed through the withdrawal of Gemma
bankers and the inability of the dCb
ers; to meet many Chinese requests,
for loans.
The present loan Is said to lava,
been oversubscribed three times !
fore the books were closed, and It IB,
! thought practically certain that a see
ind will follow shortly.
