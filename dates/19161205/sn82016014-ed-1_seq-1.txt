John Cox. a farmer and deputy

miles southwest of the city by Claude
Higsers. a 19-year-old negro-who lives
at S16 Kast Twelfth street. While

Neighbors called the sheriff's office
at once and Hugh Larimer with Verne
Welch and Karl Porter of the police
department drove out to the scene of
the crime. The two negroes. Haskell
and Watts were still there with their
guns and dogs. They joined the offi
cers in the search for the purpose of
identifying Biggers. All. of the coun
try southwest of town was scoured by
officers and farmers. A big crowd at
a sale was notified and it spread out
in every direction looking for Biggers.
He was not seen by anyone who has
reported, after Watts lost sight of
him. until he reached home.

Holman stationed himself near the
Biggers home and kept a vigil. He
saw Biggers enter the house from the
alley and hurried to the front door.
"Mother give me my jacket." Hol
man heard Biggers say.
Holman gave the door a kick and
stepped into the room, a revolver in
his hand. Biggers was standing in the
middle of the room, half undressed.
"I want you to come with me." said
Holman as he leveled his revolver at
the negro.

"I'll sure go." said Biggers. "and

down, anyhow."
Biggers put up the plea of self-defense.
He declares that Cox asked
him to disarm without showing au
thority for the order.
"I asked him who he was," said
Biggers. "He told me he was a deputy
game warden. I asked to see his star,'
and then he demanded my gun.
" 'Give me that gun.- he said, 'or
I'll leave you lying on the ground.'

Most of Big Gains Made in Ten
Week Period.
CROPS AND UIL RESPONSIBLE
Loans and Discounts Are Keep
ing Pace With Deposits.
Eyen Estimates of the 3Iost Op
timistic Exceeded.
In the ten weeks period from June
30 to September 12. Kansas state and
national banks made the sensational
jump of more than 39 million dollars
in deposits, an increase of nearly four
million a week. A statement compiled
today in the office of W. F. Benson,
state bank commissioner, shows $290,
811,977.04 for September 12, as against
251 million dollars for June. The
showing is an increase of nearly 15
per cent over any previous record of
Kansas banks. Records for the year
show an increase in deposits of nearly
70 million dollars.
With the smashing of deposit rec
ords, Kansas banks maintained their
earning capacity thru the heavy crop
selling period. The record as com
piled todcy shows loans and discounts
aggregating J21 4.630.491.27, or nearly
75 per cent of the total deposits re
turning an interests rate to the banks.
The overdraft showing of ,$915,977.54
is about one-third of 1 per cent of the
deposits. Total resources of $360,375,
303.77 are shown in the report.
Ten Weeks Keeord.
During the period from June 30 to
September 12, the 987 state banks in
creased their deposits more than 20
million dollars, while deposits in the
221 national banks of the state were
increased more than 1 9 million dol
lars. More than fifty per cent of the
year's gain In deposits was made in the
ten weeks period. The state banks in
creased 36 million dollars in deposits
during the year, while national banks
increased slightly more than thirty
million dollars.
A year ago predictions were made
that Kansas bank deposits would this
year pass the quarter billion dollar
mark. Such predictions caused many
wise bankers to smile. But this year
the deposits will most probably go con
siderably above the 300 million mark.
November statements of national
banks have not been made public,
while a call will be made on state
banks for p. report some time this
month.
Cause of Increases.
The heavy crop selling in the wheat
producing counties of the western half
of the state, followed by extensive oil
and mineral developments in the
southern and eastern counties of the
state, have added the million to Kan
sas bank deposits. Abnormal advances
in the prices of grain have meant
many millions of dollars to Kansas
farmers since the issuance o the Sep
tember bank report and final bank re
ports for the year may show increases
as startling as those contained in the
September report.
Under the report issued today state
banks are shown to have held $165,
619.977.04 at the close of business
September 12. The national bank re
port is given in round figures. It
shows $125,192,000 in deposits. Loans
and discounts of state banks are given
at $130,744,491.27. while national
banks reported $83,886,000.

per pound, while some are paying as
high as 10 cents.
"2o Kansas newspaper could con

them," said Mr. Marble. "We know
print paper is being sold to the metro
politan newspapers at less than 3
cents; that contracts for 1917 are be

want is to be able to buy our paper
proportionately as cheap. The price
we have been paying for years is from
$38 to $40 a ton. Now we have to
pay $110 to $130. Unless we can get
relief from this discrimination, prac

New York, Dec. 5. Georges Car

The date and place of the bout have

The match has been in the making for
several months and the correspondence

the bout within a notch or two of in

Carpentier, holder of the European
heavyweight championship, has been
serving with the French army since
virtually the beginning of the war. He
has repeatedly refused excellent of

London, Dec. 5. On the highest au

His resignation was drafted and sent
to Premier Asquith immediately after
he received an intimation that Asquith
was unwilling to agree to the plan

would not be a member.

had decided to resign, the Exchange

To Reconstruct Ministry.
London, Dec. 5.--"England's recon
struction" of her government, now in
process, must be taken as emphatic
reiteration of Britain's determination
to fight the war to a finish. In all
the maze of discussion of what sort of
"reconstruction" was being framed,
this fact stood- out today.
The cabinet crisis was precipitated
by public demand voiced by the
cabinet member admittedly closest to
the public, David Lloyd George for
more vigorous conduct of the war; for
more compact organization to direct
England's energies against Prussian
ism; for concentration of responsibil
ity and power. It was concededtoday
that out of the "crisis" would come

in British politics; He has until

Washington, Dec. 5. Declaring the
country "cannot and should not con

President Wilson appeared before a
joint session of congress today and ap
pealed for immediate action on hia
program of "settlement and regulation
of difficulties" between the railroads
and their trainmen.
Statement of the need of such legis
lation occupied the bulk of his annual

livered. It recommended passage of
the provisions included but not acted
upon in his last special appeal last
August, At that time a nation-wide
strike necessitated congressional ac
tion. In a late addition to his message
the president urged the passage by the
house of the vocational and industrial
educational measures passed by the
senate during the last session.

The thrill and dramatic tension so
noticeable in the president's three
previous visits to the Sixty-fourth con
gress were lacking today. Crowds
thronged the capitol, however, and
hours before the session was sched
uled to convene, all gallery entrances
were besieged with- men and women
endeavoring to "work their way past

Altho both branches of congress are
seething over the high cost of living
problem and Interest in this has over
shadowed all other proposed action,
the president made no reference to it
today.
He is receiving reports from differ
ent executive departments, however,
in an effort to devise the best possible
plan for the curbing of soaring prices.
It is believed the president will eith

question later or take it up personally
with the house and senate leaders
when a plan he deemed feasible has
been found.
So serious does the president re

that he has determined to keep it out

interested in a solution of the diffi

Gentlemen of the Congress:
In fulfilling at this time the duty
laid upon me by the constitution of

the Union and recommending to your
consideration such legislative measures
as may be judged necessary and expe

to do at once.

In the first place, it seems to me
