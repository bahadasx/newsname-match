With the British Army on the Front
in France, Friday, Dec. 1 (via Lon
don, Pec. 4). That success in mod
ern warfare often may depend upon
the employment of some article or
contrivance of ancient oeign and
cunniniv has again been demonstrat
ed by the Canadian troops in their
most recent advances against the en
emy. The old American Indian and i
trapper trick of the "tump line," car- j
eying great weights upon the back by j
means of a leather thong across the ,
forehead, helped the Canadians to go j
forward when all otner means m
transport was difficult, and: through
supplies thus brought up, they com
pletely captured the famous Kegina
trench, which hitherto had resisted
all efforts.
Capture "Desire" Trench.
Not only did this particular, contin
gent of Canadians take Kegina trenc h,
but they pressed forward under the
fiery shelter of a curtain of shells,
until they established themselves in
"Desire" trench, an objective of su
preme desirability. The very name
given to It by the British war-map
makers bespoke the importance at
taehedto it.
When the Canadiuns were given the
word to advance, it was quickly seen
that the wintry mud would soon play
havoc with the usual methods of
bringing up supplies, and without un
interrupted supply support, no attack
could succeed. So, old troopers from
western Canada suggested the old
trappers' scheme.
"Tump" Companies l-ormcd.
Hundreds of Canadians knew the
trick, and within a few moments
three "tump" companies were organ
ized to bring up ammunition. Through
mud, darkness and hostile shell fire
this Indian file of men maintained an
ndless chain of ' supplies until the
faithful army mule could again get
to work.
Canadian dash and daring did the
rest, and once they gained the
trench there was a rush of Hermans
to surrender. Seventeen officers were
taken In one batch an unusually
largo number to yield together.
Then followed characteristic In
stances of the battlefield. In clean
ing up the position, one dugout, hid
den under shell-tossed earth and de
bris, was overlooked until two stretcher-bearers,
searching for wounded,
approached. Much to the amusement
of these two unarmed soldiers, the
Hermans began to pour out, with
their hands high above their heads.
Half a score had emerged when the
stretcher men thought the situation
was Incoming a little too serious.
With a fine spirit of bravery, how
ever, one pointed to the dugout door
and in tones more stentorian than
polite, shouted: "Get back there."
Make Haul of Irisoners.
Meekly they obeyed, and while one
stretcher-bearer kept guard, the other
ent for help and a haul 0 two-score
prisoners resulted.
Two other stretcher-bearers had

The armie'!of the Teutonic allies
figh'ing In southwestern Rumania,
with Bucharest their main objective,
have Joined hands from the Danube
in the south, to the northwest of Ru
charesl, where, coming- through the
mountainous region, they have
reached the town of TerRovlstcn.
I'erlin announces that the battle of
the Argechu river has come to a final
conclusion, with the Teutonic allies
the victors, and that all along the
front they are drawing closer to Hu
charest. With the capture of Tergovistea,
and farther sonih, the driving of the
Rumanians beyond the railroad Junc
tion town of Tu, the central powers'
forces now hold intact all the railway
lines running; into Bucharest from
the west. The I'redeal pass line, run
ning north from the capital into
Transylvania, Is the solo remaining
railway connection in western Walla
chia partly In Rumanian hands, and
with the Teutons now ner.rly astride
this line at Rrcza, and rapidly advanc
ing, this route seems likely to be
taken from them.
Rumanians Are Defeated.
T0 the south and southwest of Hu
ctinrest, J.e forces of Field Marshal
von Mackensen have defeated the Ru
manians and captured the town of
Oradiehtca, twelve miles from the
capital.
In this fighting, according to Ber
lin, the Rumanian army suffered san
guinary casualties and on Sunday
lost more than 8,000 men made pris
oner and thirty-five cannon.
In Dobrudja, and in the northwest
u 1 1 J-r the 'Hukowina and Transyl
vaman fronts, violent fighting is in
progTess. According to Sofia, in the
former region, the Bulgarians repulsed
heavy Russian attacks. Berlin admits
slight progress in the northwest by
the Russians, north and south of Tro
tus. In the Carpathians south of
Jablonltza, the Russinns captured an
other height.
Kerbs Win in Macedonia.
Aside from the Macedonian theater,
little fighting of moment has taken
place.' Berlin admits a realignment
of the Teutonic allied front east of
the Cerna river, while the Serbian
war office asserts that the Serbs here
have captured an entire series of pow
erfully fortified Bulgarian positions
north of (Irunishte and Hudimirtsa,
and taken In addition guns, machine
guns, ammunition and piiso-iors,
British sappers near Ypres and
Wytschaete, Belgium, by mine explo

picked up and were bringing in an
apparently helplessly wounded Go
man. Suddenly a German shell burst
over them. The bearers dropped the
stretcher with its burden and darted
to cover. Much to their astonish
ment, their "casualty" hopped off
the stretcher and started running to
ward the German front line. The
stretcher men took after their pa
tient and overhauled him. When ex
amined, he was found to have a very
serious leg wound; how he managed
to run puzzles the surgeons.
After the battle- by understanding,
both forces were allowed to collect
their dead and wounded from "No
Man's Land," between the trenches
one of the comparatively few in
stances in the war in which this has
!een permitted. Searching parties
moved freely about, Immune from
snipers or bombs, the only condition
being that they must not too closely
approach the enemy trench.
Protested and Retracted.
One German kept coming closer and
closer to the 'Canadian' lines and was
twice warned away, and then, as his
purpose semod only to0 clear, two
Canadians sprang over the I arapet,
and, in their own language, "pinched''
him. He was taken before the colonel,
where he made an indignant protest
pgainst his arrest, pointing to the
Red Cross on his sleeve. The colonel
conwdsnoA. .ihe..mattcrand thought
perhaps the man was right," and an
nounced that he would send him back
to his own front line under escort.

London, Dee. 4. Documents rc-l.,-e
irive the text of the reply
of General von Hissing, military gov
ernor of Belgium, to Cardinal Mer
ger's letter of October lit, and the
cardinal's rejoinder of November 10
General von Hissing's reply, dated
October 2fi. begins by denying any
violation of the assurance, of the Ger
man commanders gave at the begin
ning of the war that no men be re
,.,ve,i f,.m Belgium, declaring that
such removals had been justified by
'the Clandestine emigration oi i.um
numbers of young men wishing to
join the Belgian army." He adds;
"The German authorities would have
been unite justified In following the
example of Kngland and France, but
they have not done so.''
Blames It on l.nglniid.
Contending that the employment of
Belgian unemployed in Germany has
nothing to do with the conduct of th
war, but is jiurclj a social and econo
mic measure, General von Hissing
says:
Great Britain's merciless economic
isolation of Germany bears equally
on Belgium; bringing a state of pub
lic calamity to Belgium."
General von Hissing then declares
that the Belgian people realized the
state of affairs and that tens ot
thousand of tiiein have gone to Ger
many voluntarily, wliero they could
get better pay. Others would follow,
he says, but are deterred by influence
svsteinatically brought, to bear on
them. Ho invites the cardinal to
study the situation from a social ana
economic view point.
Replying on November 10, Cardinal
Mercier recalls the promise made by
Haron von Huehne and subsequently
confirmed by Baron von der Uoltz,
and says:
t urdlnal's Sharp Reply.
ii'i,,, ,,i.il..rtnl;lni was explicit and
entirely without time lit that -young!
people have nothing to fear that they
may be sent to Germany, either to be
enrolled in the army, or employed at
forced labor.' This engagement has
been violated every day a thousand
times for fourteen days."
The cardinal denies that, the Bel
gians menaced public order.
'Cardinal. Mereier. then says that "If,
as von Hissing declares, such labor
has nothing to do with the conduct of
t lie war, properly speaking, it has
stomething to do with tho war, "Im
properly speaking."
"For," bo continues, "even if a Bel
gian does not take up arms, he re
leases the hands of a German work
man who will taken them up."
The cardinal com hides as follows;
Recalls von Blssints's Words.
"Monsieur Governor, at the begin
ning of my letter 1 recalled tho noble
words of your excellency: '1 have
come to Belgium to heal tho -wounds
of your country.' If you excelleii7
could, as we, priests do, enter the
honies of the working people and hear
the lamentations of the wives and
mothers to whom your decree brings
niourninir and poverty, you would be
better able to sec yourself that the J
wounds of the Belgian people are
open and bleeding.

silence tho voice, the cries of out
raged conscience.
"May God. on whom we call
with
op-
all the ardor of the soul of an
messed people, inspire you with
pity
of the good Samaritan."
Protest Against policy.
The British government, in con
junction with Great Britain's allies,
lias issued a "declaration regarding
the present state of Belgium," in
which protest is made to the civilized
world against the slave raids con
ducted by the German authorities In
Belgium, and a warning Riven to the
world that "the work of relief which
,.nir:,k tuivii iiiiilt un is in danger uf !
falling."
The document, afler reciting the as
sistance the allies have given in the
past work of relief in Beligum, says:
"Tho allies only stipulated that the
Germans should equally draw no ad
vantage from the operations of the
iiutri commission,, that they should
not imported or native supplies. iinTl
that the distribution of relief should
not be used for the purpose of coerc

Juarez, Mcx., Dec. 4. Villa's ban
dits were retreating north toward the
border the night before Chihuahua
City -was evacuated by Carrair.a
troops. It became known here today
from an absolutely reliable source.
For four days the forces of Gen
eral Trevino had defeated the Villa
troops and at U o'clock Sunday night,
November 26, tho bandits were retir
ing toward tho north with the report
ed intention of attacking Juarez, ac
cording to this same source. Upon (
learning of tho humlils' move toward
Ihe border, General Trevino is said to
have sent a message to General Fran
cisco Gonzales, warning him to mass
all of his forces from wstern Chihua
hua at Juarez, in order to prevent an
attack upon the border town, and
complications with the I'nitod States.
This caused General Gonzales to or
der the mobilization of hi brigade
here as a buffer against the bandit
force which was expected to move
north on Monday, November "7.
Villa W ins !7 Trick.
Instead, Villa swung u round to the
northwest and slioped Into the sub
urbs of Chihuahua City, during the
early morning of November and
started a general attack which result
ed in a. rout of the Carranza forces
and the resulting panic, according to
tills source. Santa Itosa hill, the
"key to the. city, was not taken un- j
til after this rout was well under
way. The two batteries of four can
non each, which were captured on j
Santa Hosa hill by Villa, were not
taken by his troops until after a t
large part of Trevino's command had
left the city for tho south, It. was said.
It was cbarged by this same source
that someone in authority "lost his
head," and was responsible for the
rout which, he said, was not warrant
ed by tho military situation
Moves lo Southward.
It was stated here unofficially to
day that Villa wjis expected to go
south from San Andres or some other
point on the Mexico Northwestern
railroad, which runs west of Chihua

cache in the mountains of western
Chihuahua, Villa and his command,
it was stated, was expected lo go in

The reeeijd. of a message from the

re-occupation of Chihuahua City by
(leneral Trevino and C.eneral Mur

nit-ssage to reach the border since
Villa entered tlie city last Sunday
night. It gave no information regard

about whom many inquiries have been
received by 'arianJ'.a officials here.
Hut these fears were (piloted tonight
by a message from (leneral Trevino,
stating that, only Chinese suffered
from bandit cruelty.
