L TO E
The Friend, last issue, contains
the following tribute to the late
Mrs. Ileapy:
Susan Dorcas Ileapy is a name
that willl 1)0 treasured through life
by many quiet folk all over this
Territory. Mrs. Ileapy was splendid
ly endowed with a physical frame
of strength and abounding vitality.
She had a largeness of power and
an overflowing vigor whicl opened
the way for the free entrance of her
Ambience into every one she met.
"shc was also a woman of unusual
culture. Growing up in a home de
voted to tho cause of education, un
der a father whose life had been
given to training tho young, she
had the advantage not only of sound
instruction but also of wide travel
while still young. She disciplined
herself to observe, acquired several
foreign languages and throughout
life maintained a close acquaintance
with the best things the world over.
It was a delight to converse with
her, her knowledge was so accurate
and so inclusive. Her scholarship
was not technical but human, for it
was the human touch that always
appealed most deeply to her. Best
of all, she had a cultured spirit.
rnr. folt. in her instinctlv the pres
ence and dominance of a soul that
had known the discipline of long
and varied spiritual experience. All
these elements combined to form a
personality of rare beauty. And all
that she was and had was lavishly
given to others. She was irresistibly
drawn to eveiyone because every
fellow human being was a child of
the Great Father and therefore her
-jfcrolhor, her sister. Her dominat
' ing characteristic was love for oth
ers, prompting her to serve them.
She was beautifully unselfish. It
was natural to her to give herself
generously to children, to unman
ageable girls, to any one of any
race or any social status, and all in
the simplest, most friendly way
possible. One could not but feel in
her the touch of the Master. In the
best sense she was a woman of tho
world, a typo of tho .golden ago
dawning in this world. Because
she loved much, she was much be
loved and many a life is richer for
her strengthening friendship. Such
a character lives on in the convic
tion of all who know her. If God
lives, then' this spirit which held so
much of the Great Father, can never
die. Was not this what Jesus meant
when he said, "Because I live ye
shall live also."?

ENJOYABLE CONCERTS
While on Kauai last week Prof
Ideler and Miss Sutherland, of Oahu
College, gave two delightful concerts,
one at the Knudsen home in Keka
ha and tho other in Lihue Social
hall. The former which was under
the suspices of tho Waimea Literary
Club, was largely attended and much
enjoyed. The latter was given for
the benefit of a branch of Red Cross
work. Ladies of Lihue were quite
diligent in disposing of tickets, so
! that a neat sum was realized.
It is so seldom that Kauai has the
opportunity of hearing real music
that expressions of delight with both
of these entertainments have been
generally heard.
Chas. Blake Retires
Charles Blake, for many years
deputy tax assessor of the district
of Koloa, last week tendered his
resignation to Division Assessor J.
K. Farley and retired on Thurs

MEETING
OF RURAL y. M .C. ft.
At a recent meeting of the gen
eral committees of the Rural Y. M.
C. A. at the home of Mr. Loomis,
lileele, it was decided to approve of
the development of a Territorial
'organization of the interests and
activities of the Y. M. C. A., with
a central committee in Honolulu,
and Messrs. Brandt and Lydgate
were .elected members-representa
tives of Kauai to that committee.
Attention was called to the open
door and the urgent need for.Y. M.
C. A. welfare work among that
large and steadily increasing ele
ment of our population, the Filipi-.
nos; they are a most anienablo
people, and are eagerly reaching
out for just that sort of thing. There
should be a special Secretary who
could give his whole time to this
work. The lion in the way, how
ever, is tho very considerable ex
pense of such a new departure. It
was decided to commend this work
to the Kauai Planters Association,
as most valuable and profitable wel
fare work, in the interest of labor
efficiency, and labor contentment,
with the hope that they might as
sist in finuncing it.
At the close of the, meeting Mrs.
Loomis treated the Committee to
delicious refreshments, in which the
ladies participated.
FARffl AND FOX
ON MOVIE BILL
Fox Film Corporation sends one
of its leading stars and one of its
strongest offerings to Kauai theaters
today. William Farnum is the star
and ''A man of sorrow" is tlio pho
to-drama, it is a typical Fox film
and a typical Farnum vehicle. It
should register a decided hit with
patrons of the theaters whose appe
tito for melodrama is largo and
usually well satisfied.
The story is one long series of
tense situations in which, for a
while it looks as though Vrong
would conquer right. The reverse,
however, is a fact but not until the
bitterest diegs of sorrow have been
sipped by the man in tho case, al
so the woman. The finale is about
as strong as that of any Fox photo
play thus far sent to here and
William Fox takes a keen do
light in strong finishes. Farnuni
has the support of a big Fox cast.
Bonus Money Here
The bonus money to be paid to
plantation laborers on Kauai arrived
at the banks and some of the plan
tation offices last week and at a
number of places will be distrib
uted today. About 8750,000 will
bo paid out. Tho money is in paper
currency, so paper money will b
quite common on this island in the
next few days.
A rumor is around that many
Filipinos will use their bonus money
to try to reach and establish them
selves on the Coast.
For Saturday Nights
For the benefit of out-of-town
friends the Lihue Store has decided
to keep open up to 9 o'clock every
Saturday night until Christmas.
Seethe big Christmas display and
other attractions of the store, then
have dinner at the new Tip Top
Cafu and, finally,, take in the.entor
tainment in the theater, accompan
ied by the Wurlitzer orchestra.

AMONG THE CHURCHES
Thanksgiving was observed as
usual at the Lihue Union church
with a special service. The decora
tions, which constituted an impor
tant part of the service, were unique
and appropriate, consisting mainly
of fruits and agricultural products,
very tastefully and effectively ar
ranged in large masses. Mrs. Car
ter, who was decorating committee
for the month, was assisted by a
number of volunteers, who made
light work of the task. Seldom has
the church looked better.
By way of special music Mrs. W.
II. Grote sang "Unto tho Hills;"
a beautiful thing, and rendered with
very fine effect. Mr. Lydgate's
theme was "Making the Best of
Things" with some interesting and
searching applications to local con
ditions. The congregation was the largest
Thanksgiving one in history of, the
c'lurch.
SUNDAY KORNING
The gem of the service on Sunday
morning, at the Lihue Union church
was the, duet, "I will magnify The
Lord," by Mrs. II. L. Sheldon and
Miss M. Wood. It was a rare bit
of music, as difficult as beautiful,
such as only the accomplished vocal
ist could render; it was done to a
fine finish that delighted all who
heard it. "
The church looked very pretty in
white and yellow chrysanthemums;
the work of Mrs. A. S. Wilcox.
AT ELEELE
At Eleelo there was an unusually
good audience, with a commendahly
large proportion of young men. A
really fine rendering of the hymns
gives welcome evidence of tho new
stimulus and enthusiasm that is
abroad there in church matters,
and does credit to the newly organiz
ed choir.
Mr. Jesus Fined
A Lihue Portuguese named Man
uel Jesus, while learning to drive a
Buick "Six", ran into the ear of
Win. Kuhhnan, also of Lihue, in
front of Francis Gay's plaee, Wai
mea, Sunday afternoon. Kuhl-
nian's car was turned completely
over and badly damaged. In the

fined S50 for heedless diiving.
