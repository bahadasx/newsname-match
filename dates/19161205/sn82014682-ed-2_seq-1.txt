LESSON OF WAR SHOWS
VALUE OF PROTECTION;

in Laying Bogey of "Free

cratic Administration ;
'XFull recognition of a year of un
paralleled prosperity In the sugar in
dustry of the islands and a simultaneous-
warning that the high tide
will recede that there are lean years
to come are foremost in the address
of Retiring President Allen W. T. Bct-
tomley, the- feature today of the
thirty-sixth annual meeting of the Ha
waiian Sugar Planters' Association.
: President Bottomley urged the
' necessity for economy and, the de
velopment of. efficiency 'in every
- branch . of the raw sugar Industry.
Perhaps the mpst Important part of
his warning is that the Hawaiian plan
tations must raise the grade of their
output . ' :- , A
'. He spoke of "the necessity for a
1 great improvement being made in the
quality of sugars which we are send
ing to the refiners," and added:
.Though wehavt long been accus
tomed to paying mors attention to. get-'
" ting, as much as pcixlbls for our
susara than, we have to their quality.
I" feci sura that different methods
must be adopted In the future and that
every effort must bt made to change
Hawaiian tujars from being the least
desirable to kelng one of the most de
irable sugars offered to the ref Inert."
He commented that-Hawaii is al
ready at' a disadvantage in this re
spect as compared with Cuba. . He had
previously explained the necessity for
an Improvement , in Hawaiian quality
by saying that unless there is radical
improvement from the beginning of
the new crop, new contracts with, the
refiners will only be made subject to a
deduction based on refining value
-greatly in excess of anything we
have ever had to pay in the past"
President Bottomley's address in
full follows:
li,ln opening this SCth annual mect
Xuig of the association, Jt gives me
C great pleasure to refer to the fact
that the year 1916 has been probably
the most fortunate year that the sugar
industry of these islands has ever ex-
"According to the Underwooa a ami ,
Bill of 1513 sugar was scheduled to t
go cn the 'free list' this year, viz., on j
the,, 1st of May, 1916. but before that,
date, on the recommendation of the .
ecretiry of the treasury, Congress,
as you know, repealed the provision
of ti.e tariff act taking the duty off,
sugar, and left a duty of a Htue over
one cent per pound on Cuban sugars.
Thus the day, which since 1913, we
had all been looking forward to ..with
" so much dread, came and went and
ttte domestic sugar growers still found
' themselves protected by a reasonable
duty. " v
Lesson .of War Emphasized
"How vital It la for these United
. States to have a supply of sugar
grown and manufactured at home, in
dependent of the sugar supply of the
rest of the world, is surely well illus
trated by the difficulties which the
; nations of Europe are now experienc
ing in obtaining their sugar and tne
prices which they have to pay for it
under present conditions. Apart alto
,s pether from the question of revenu-.
the sugir wtua Jon today in Europe
(which would also exist in this coun
try, were it rot for the domestic 'sup
ply) should surely present to all think
.ing people the strongest kind of an
argqmcntin favor of continuing the
k present protective duty, without
JVfcich the -eet and cane sugar pro-Ai-ucers
of the 'United States cannot
exist nnder normal conditions. Aside
. from arguments such as these, and
although the Democratic administra
tion, which reduced the duty and al
most removed it altogether, has been
returned to power for another four
" years, I believe that with the increas
ing national expenditures and the ne
cessity for retaining and enlarging
every source of government revenue,
we have no reason at any rate n the
immediate future to fear a return to ,
a basis of free sugar. i
"In addition to the repeal of the j
free sugar clause so earnestly desired

and an unusual large attendance, the
thirty-sixth annual meeting of the
Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association
opened this morning at 10 o'clock in
the rooms of the Chamber of Com
merce with President Alien W. T. Bot
tomley in the chair.
Following the reading of the re
ports of President Bottomley and
Secretary W. O. Smith, on a motion
made by. J, T. Moir, the old board of
trustees was reelected, with the excep
tion of F. M. Swanzy, whose place waa
taken by ; E. H. Wodehouse. Mr.

illness.,; A recess was then taken and
tbe- trustees chose .officer for the
fensuing.year.- . . - ;
" Georg Rodiek, the new president"
then took the chair. . In accepting the
office be said : "I appreciate the honor
which, ' has been bestowed upon me ;
and hope that I shall be ale to fill
the'positlon satisfactorily. In return I
would, like the support of all the
members of the association." ':
The business of the? meeting being
over, the yearly report of the asso
ciation experiment station was Intro
duced by J. F. C. "Hagens, chairman
of the committee, and H. P. Agee, di
rector of . the station, carried on the
discussion. Agee opened the discus
sion ; by. saying that after striving for
three and a half years a natural
enemy of the anomala beetle had
been found this past summer in the
scolia wasp, brought here from -the
Orient i -
F. A. G. Muir, entomologist of the
station, said that five different para
sites had been introduced, and al
though the experiments had not been
completed, the scolia wasp seemed to
give' the beat results. The anomala
beetle,, he said, seems to act in out
breaks, not confining itself to one
field, and after it had ravaged one
crop it did not appear there again
for several years, if ever.
The question of the leafhopper para
sites was then taken up and O. H.
Swezey said that new parasites to aid
the old had been turned loose, as' it
had been found that the outbreaks of
the leafhopper were occurring in the
high land. The present parasites had
been collected from warm climates,
