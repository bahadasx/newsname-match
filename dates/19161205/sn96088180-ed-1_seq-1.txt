Washington, Dec.' 5. Declaring
the country "cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound Industrial disturbance,"
President Wilson appeared before a
Joint session of congress today and
appealed for Immediate action on his
program of "settlement' and regula
tion of difficulties" between the rail
road and their trainmen'. '
Statement of the need of such leg
islation occupied the bulk or his an
nual message the shortest one be
has delivered. ' ' '
It recommended paasage or the
provisions included, but not acted
upon In his last special appeal- last
August. At that time a nation-wide
strike necessitated congressional ac
tion. , '
In a la(e addition to his message,
the president urged the passage by
the house or the vocational and In
dustrial education measures passed
by the senate during the laat ses
loa. , '-
Th thrill and dramatic tension so
ottc,eable (a tharealdeat'sthreopr-
vlou visits ,to the slxty-rourth con
gress were lacking today. Crowds
thronged the capltol. however, and
hours before the session was schedul
ed to tonvene, all gallery entrances
were oesleged with men and women
endeavoring to work their way past
the guards. (
Admission was by card only. ,
There were no staggering national
defense regulations, such al featured
the president's mesaage a year ago.
There was no note or war, such as
"threatened In the second message, re
porting the despatch to Germany ot
a virtual ultimatum, following the
Snaaex sinking. Nor waa there the
pressing need of speed and quick de
cision reflected In the request for
congressional action to avert a nation-wide
railroad strike last fall.
The message today constituted a
"clean-up" program.
Although, both branchea -of con
gress are seething over the high coat
of living problem "end Interest In this
has overshadowed al other proposed

EXPERTS
IS STILL HOPE
London. Dec. 5. There la still a
chance that Bucharest will be saved.
Military experts today hoped that
th Roumanian-Ruatlan forces now
defending the capital to the south,
along the Argeshu river could hold
the heavily reinforced Invaders Ui
check long enough to permit or a
few more days ot pounding by the
Russians In the Trottis river valley
A break In the German line at this
point would put the main rallrond
line from the north to Kronstadt
under serious menace. It Is this line
on which the German forces In nil
of east Transylvania are dnpendlug
for tho major portion of their sup
plies. If the Russians can wrest it
from Telitonla control tho Gorman
army In Transylvania must, Beck a
readjustment, of Its lines. Realisa
tion ot thla fact Is causing the Rus
sians to redouble their efforts at pen
etration of the German lines In
Gylmes pass.
British eert were Inclined to
doubt that the Germans had yet
brought tip heavy artillery of sur-
A-
action, the president made no ref
erence to It today. He Is receiving
reports from different' executive de
partments, however, In an effort to
dense the best possible plan for the
curbing of soaring prices.
It 1 Believed the president will
either deliver a special message on
th question later, or take It up per
sonally with the house and senate
leaders when a plan he deems feas
ible ha been found,
8o aerloua doe the president 're
gard the high cost of living question,
that he ha determined to keep It out
of politics la possible. He Is under
stood to reel that republican and
democrat are equally Interested In
a solution of the difficulty and will
make no effort to put through party
meaaore. ' . '
Diplomatlo Washington drifted
slowly Into the gallery In contrast
to, th hundred who stormed sue
oeasrnlly and unsuccessfully.
: Members of the Chinese and Jap
anese delegation war aasong the
first, to arrive. Mra. Unslag. wife
of th secretary of state. Counselor
Polk of the state department. John
Barrett, director ot the Pafi-Atarl-can
union; th Japanese ambassador
and the Swedish and Colombian min
isters and the, Nlcaraguan charge
d'affaires, were among those In the
gallery when the president arrived.
William J. Bryan entered the
chamber while the house was In re-
pending the president's ar
rival. The commoner was given a
great ovation from both aide and
took a seat with some of his demo
cratic friends.
The senate riled In at 11:65, tak
lng aeats In the first three row.
President Wilson entered the
chamber at 1 o'clock, accompanied by
a Joint committee. Wild cheering
went up from the democratic mem
bers, with a scattering of handclap
plng by the republicans. !
Some one In the gallery shouted:
"Amen." .
There was a laugh and more ap-1
plauae and the president began speak-

It was still noted here that even
the German statements with their
claims of sweeping victory, do not
carry news of capture or any con
siderable portion of the Roumanian
army. The number of prisoners has
bcCjO large, or course, but not so big
at to suggest anything more than
orderly retreat after defeats by the
Roumanians.

RESIBHS
London, Dec. 5. -On the highest
authority It wa mad known this
afternoon thaT David Lloyd-George
had resigned from th cabinet '
Hi resign ati oh waa drkfted and
sent to Premier Aaquith Immediately
after 'he received an Intimatlott that
Asquith was unwilling to agree to th
plan for a war council of which th
premier would not b a member.
' Is announcing that Lloyd-George'
had decided It resign, the Exchange
Telegraph omBny added that tonsal
annosncement of hi severance of re
lations with th cabinet wonld be
aanoanoed! tomorrow. ..y ;

to fight th war ; to s finish. ' In alt,
this mas' of discussion ot what sort
of rreconatMetlos' waa terns' trumi '
ed, this tact stood out today. ....
Th cabinet crisis waa precipitated
by public demand voiced by the cab
inet member admittedly closest to th
public, David Lloyd-George for
more vigorous conduct of th war;
for mor compact organisation to di
rect England's energies against Prus
slanlsm; for" construction ot respon
sibility and power.
It was conceded today that out ot
the "crista" would come' organisation
of a compact war council prooabrj '
ot not mor than five members to;
be given supreme control la the dl- .
rectlon of England's war energies
Whether this would mean a change '
In the personnel 'ot the cabinet or
simply designation of certain mem
bers of It to act as the new council,
was a matter ot speculation. London
newspsners held the main, difficulty
In the way of settlement ot the matter
arose through Premier Asqulth'a
feeling that, as prime minister, he . '
should be chairmen of th new war,

Asquith is known a on of th
greatest "pacltlclsters," and "placat
era" In BrKlsh politic. He has until
Thursday and, possibly until Monday,
to exercise this ability th house ot 1
common having adjourned until '
Thursday In respect to his wishes,
thus staving off formal announce
ment of any "reconstruction' until
that time. ...;; ;;vv,, ,
Many member are In favor ot a
still longer postponement until Mon
day. . ' ( .. v
There was no confirmation of a
widespread rumor that Asquith had
determined to resign, but It was be
lieved he would do so rather than
become a mer figurehead with
Lloyd-Gporge In prsctlcally full
charge of the conduct ot the war,
