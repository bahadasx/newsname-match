PROBLEM FOR MINT
How Would 2 1-2-Cent Coin Be
Made la Question.
What la your Idea of a lili-cent
piece such as It is proposed to coin?
Merchants and tho general publlp
agreo-that the coin would be accept
able for several reasons, but tlioro
have been few suggestions about It.
If the new coin is made smaller
than tho present loent piece, It will
be too email to handle conveniently.
If It Is made slightly larger than a
dime, It will have to be near the size
of a penny, A slight addition to the
site of a penny and tho 0-ccnt piece
would be confused with tho proposed
"half a Jit."
If tho new coin Is mado between
the sizes of a nickel and a quarter,

F STREET ROBBERS

In this Iodise room tho thieves con
structed n ladder by which they de
scended to the roof of tho Jelleff es
tablishment nnd later returned with
their loot, which they evidently had
packed In neat bundles for transporta
tion. Ladder ftrrewrd Together.
Tho ladder which, together with
several small ropes, Is thn only clue
which the robbers left, was screwed
together, the burglars realizing that
tho construction of tho Instrument by
nails would cause too much noise.
How tho thieves carried their booty
from tho bankers' hall, on tho thls.1
lloor of th building occupied by Ouc
llrothers, florists, at ll!l I I-' struct, un.l
mudu their cscapn without being de

of the case.
The robbers gained entrance to tho
Jelleff place by climbing down the
liuliler friini the third lloor of tho
(Judo building to thn roof of the Jelleff
building and removing a winnow irom
thn skylight of the latter place,
Mont Valuable Furs.
Only the most valuablo of the fur
pieces In the Jelleff stock was taken.
Tho loot was evidently picked over by
some fur cxprrt, who handed It piece
by nlecu through the aperture In the
skylight.
Then, returning to the lodge room
of thn bankers, In which a meeting

the burglars secured tho furs In pack
ages una presumably transported
them in an auiomonun or a van, stana

" Xo One Jiuw t.'nr.
No one has been found who saw an
autnmobllo or anything suspicious In
the vicinity of the robbery early this
morning, when it is supposed to have
happened,
The adjoining building, from which
the robbery was effected, was crowded
with men coming and going to tho
mtietlnir held In tho hall until nearly
midnight. Thn police arc at a loss to
explain how tho thieves mado their
getaway with the cumbersome loot
without causing the slightest suspic

NEW YOltK. Dec. n. Two famous
Americans, each a lender In his ywn
field, add each a sVlf-nmdo man, who
rose from tho humblest beginnings',
died today.
Ono was John I). Archbold, presi
dent of the Stnndnrd Oil Company.
The other was Oeorge C. Iloldt, call
ed tho greatest hotel man In tlic coun
try. John D. Arrhbold's first Job as a
chore boy In Halem, Ohio, earned him
ll.'Jfl a week. At sixteen years hn
had saved JMOO, and with It he tramp
ed to thn Pennsylvania oil fields, anil
worked there for eleven years. He
had been president of thn Standnrd
Oil Company since 1011, and before
that was vice president.
Revolutionised lluslnesa.
George C. Iloldt was un Immigrant
boy. He came to the United States
and got a Job peeling potatoes In a
restaurant. Ho revolutionized thn ho
tel business, and conceived innny of
the Ideas which raised American ho
tels from tho ridicule of foreign visi
tors to the best-equipped nnd most
elaborate hostelrles In tho world.
Mr Iloldt, who died In his apart
ments at thn Waldorf Astoria this
morning, wus the man who made the
modern hotel. Ilefore Iloldt thern wss
no such thing. After Iloldt started It
In Philadelphia forty years ngo, there
has been nothing else. Iloldt wss a
host to thn wholn world, but a host
who placed himself nnd his establish
ment ut the disposal of his guests In
stead of disposing of his gucata aa he
saw fit.
Borne of Ills Axioms.
Tho ciiest Is always right."
"The guest cannot deinund service.
It should be given him beforo he has
a chance to demand it."
"The guest Is the foundation of the
hotel business. Pleaao the guest and
the business succeeds."
"I don't run n hotel like a home. I
try to muko It better than a home. I
want every person who cornea to tny
hotel to know not Just to feel rrst to
know that our entire establishment Is
at his disposal." . ., .
These am some of. the ihlnrs that
Oeorgu C Iloldt did to make the hotel
business one of the most highly or
giinlzed and Intricate enterprises In tho
world today.

Oeorge C. Iloldt was a native of a
