CONGRESS TO RUSH
ANOTHER RAILLAW
DEMOCATIC LEADERS AS8URE
PRESIDENT THEY WILL EX.
PEDITE LEGISLATION.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 4. —When
congress reconvened today President
Wilson had the assurances of Speaker
Clark and Representative Kitchin, ma
jority leader, that they would try to
hasten enactment of railroad legisla
tion desired by the administration.
Both expressed the opinion in a confer
ence with the president last night that
measures to supplement the Adamson
law could be passed in the short ses
sion, but they asked the president's in
fluence to eliminate the usual two
wqeks Christmas holiday recess. Sim
ilar promises of cooperation on the
railroad acts will be sought by the
president this week from senate lead
ers.
TO HASTEN HEARING.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 4. —The
supreme court was formally asked to
day to expedite hearing of the Mis
souri, Oklahoma and Gulf railroad case
chosen to determine constitutionality
of the Adamson act passed in Septem
ber when a nation wide railroad strike
was imminent.
A motion, concurred in by the rail
roads to set the case "for hearing up
on a day as eary as may suit the conr
venience of the court," was presented
personally in open court by Solicitor
General Davis of the department of
Justice. Such motions usually are act
ed on a week after presentation. The
date of December 18 was understood
to be preferred by all counsel, to en
able adequate preparation for argu
ments and filings of briefs. It was be
lieved certain that the court would as
sign the arguments before the holiday
recess December 22. It was regarded
as posr "hie but very unlikely that a de
cision would be rendered before the
law becomes effective January 1.
A stipulation for suspension of all
litigation over the Adamason act and
for protection of railroad employes fi
nancial interests pending the court's
decision in the test case was included
in the motion. It requires the railroads
in all pending suits attacking the act.
to keep accounts of wages due em
ployes on the eight hour basis with
provision fofr their prompt payment or
enforced collection if the supreme
court upholds the statute. The stipu
lation also pledges the railroads to Join
in expediting the test case.

They Are Passed
Washington, D. C., Dec. 4.—Congress

the short session which will mark the
closing of President Wilson's first
tertn.
-With a crowded program of legisla
tion, foremost in which is the presi
dent's plan for railroad legislation, sen
ators and representatives settled down
to work as Speaker Clark and Vice
President Marshall brought down the
gavels.
Today's opening was marked by the
usual flood of bills and resolutions.
The energies of the administration
leaders were at once concentrated on
the passage of the big supply bills nec
essary for the conduct of the govern
ment.
Speaker Clarke declared the next
house, on the basis of the last elec
tion, would show at least 216 demo
crats without Scully of New Jersey or

to the republicans. These figures do
not include the independent group of

fragists failed to materialize. Demo
cratic leader Kitchin and Republican
Leader Mann met in the middle of the
chamber and exchanged greetings.

resolutions to meet in joint session at
1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon to hear
President Wilson deliver his address
and then adjourned.

BEWARE, GIRLS, OF
THIS GAY DECEIVER
POSTAL AUTHORITIES LOOKING
INTO CHARGE AGAINST ONE
CHARLES H. WAX.
Chicago, Dec. 4. —Strange tangles of
mistaken identity was revealed today
by the further examination of the man
known here as Charles H. Wax, who,
according to the police, admitted last
night he is "Oliver Osborne," the mys
terious "O. O." whose escapedes with
Miss Rae Tanzer, a New York mil
liner, resulted in her filing suit for
$250,000 against James W. Osborne, a
New York attorney in March, 1915.
Wax, who asserts he was graduated
from Columbia university In 1907 and
is a physician, was taken into custody
by city detectives and U. S: post of
fice inspectors at his fashionable apart
ment here yesterday. He is said by
the police to have been known by
more than a dozen aliases and to have
more than two hundred
young women in various parts of the
country out of their savings.
The postal authorities are investi
gating alleged fraudulent |use of the
mails.
In his statement he denied that he
had played anything but an innocent
role in the suit against Mr. Osborne
and asserted that the marked likeness
between his appearance and that of
the New York attorney was respons
ible for the suit.
Wax told of the flirtation which led
to his acquaintance with Miss Tanzer
and of his later attentions to her In
cluding a trip to Plainfleld, N. J.,
which Is said to have directed the at
tention of federal officers to the case.
He insisted that he went to Mr. Os
borne and told him of his acquaintance
with the case in the hope that he
might clear the attorney of the stigma
attached to the case, but because of
the publicity given the suit decided it
would be dangerous for him to remain
in New York.
"Mr. Osborne and I look strikingly
alike, although he Is a much older
man," Wax said. "In fact I put on
his glasses and his wife laughed at the
way it strengthened the resemblance.
I am thirty-six. Mr. Osborne must be
more than fifty."
Wax has been living in Chicago six
months with a woman known as Mrs.
Ida Dorothy Wax to whom he says he
is legally wedded.
A part of last summer he spent in
Wausau, Wis., where as Dr. Francis B5.
Burke he is said to have been a social
favorite. Until a few days ago he was
employed here as head night porter in
a downtown department store.
Mrs. Wax asserted that she had
known her husband only a little more
than a year and that they were mar
ried a year ago but declined to say
where.
NEW TAX IS NOT
WELL UNDERSTOOD
Dubuque, Dec. 4.—Declaring that Ig
norance of the provisions of the new
federal tax on estates will not relieve
executors and administrators from
payment of penalties, Louis Murphy,
collector of internal revenue, points
out that persons of means should give
it their prompt consideration. The
tax, called the estate tax. became ef
fective September 8, 1916. The es
tates of all persons dying after that
date, the gross amount of which ex
ceeds $60,000. or the net amount $50,
000 are subject to return to the col
lector of internal revenue for the dis
trict in which decedent was a resident
at the time of his death.
Gross estate is defined as the entire
amount of every kind of property,
real, personal and mixed, including in
surance not payable directly to a ben
eficiary named in the insurance con
tract. To this amount should be added
ail property transferred by decedent
during his life time but In contempla
tion of or, intended to take efTect at
death. This includes gifts or sales that
were not made for an adequate consid
eration In money or money's worth, In
contemplation of death: also dece
dent's share In Join bank accounts or
In any other property owned by dece
dent jointly In with others. That part
of the estate of nonresidents situated
in the United States is subject to the
tax and the exemption of $50,000 allow
ed residents is not allowed nonresi
dents.
In computing the net estate upon
which the tax is to be paid certain de
ductions are permitted from gross es
tate. Among others, funeral expenses,
administration expenses, unpaid mort
gages. support of dependents, etc., and
an exemption of $50,000. An important
provision of the law is that executors.
administrators, or whoever first comes
into possession of any property of
such decedent shall within thirty dhys
from their appointment as executor or
administrator or from the day of ac
quiring possession of property file a
notice with the collector of such ap
pointment or acquisition of property.
