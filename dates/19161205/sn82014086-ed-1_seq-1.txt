YOUTH KILLED WHILE
7 ' HUNTING IN LITCHFIELD
Missing for Two Days, His Body Was
Found Beside a Stone Wall.
Litchfield, Conn., Dec. 4. Medical
Examiner Page said tonight that he
probably would render a verdict of
accidental death in the case of Alex
ander Fearon, aged 21, of Brooklyn, N.
Y., whose body was found" today be
side a stone wall. The youth had
been missing since yesterday morning,
when he left on a hunting trip w&h
two dogs. One of the docs returned
today, shot through' the jaw. This in--cident
led to a search and the finding
of the body. There was a bullet hole
through the forehead, evidently from
the rifle he had been carrying. The
medical examiner believes that the
gun was accidentally discharged
while Fearon was clambering over the
stone wall. ,
A note found in the young man's
room caused some speculation, but Mr.
Page declared his belief that it had
nothing to do with the death. The
note, which was addressed to John
Gelden of Katonah, N. Y., said: "Dear
Uncle John: Forgive me for what I
have done. It has been hard to get
along. I love you and Aunt Susan.
You are the best friend I ever had.
Alex."

NO STRICT CENSORSHIP
OF DOMINICAN NEWS
uniy to suppress Such Matter as
Would Hamper Restoration of Order
Washington, Dec. 4. When the at
tention of Secretary Daniels was drawn
today to the suppression of news of
events in the Dominican Republic by
the censorship established by the
American naval forces, he said it was

vent the transmission of legitimate
news, but only to exclude from the
cables and the local newspapers such
matter as would hamper the success
of the plana for " the restoration of
order. Mr. Daniels gave orders that
transmission of legitimate news to the
United States should not be interfered

the only purpose of the censorship is
to prevent spreading a propaganda cal
