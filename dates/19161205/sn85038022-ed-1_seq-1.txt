Ultl TI,V AN'KKCIA TKIl
The Recond number of the lecture
oousro of the Maysvllle High School
waa held last night with George R
Colby, eartooniat, aa the headline at
traction. A large crowd waa preaent
deaplte the bad weather and all great
ly enjoyed Mr. Colby'a entertainment
and lecture.
Mr. Colby'a work on the atage In
the procesa of drawing the varloua pic
tures waa perhapa done more quickly
than any other cartoonist that ever
nppeared on tho local platform. In
thla rcapect ho challenges the entire
world in the making of platform pic
tures combining quickness and artis
tic work. Together with the various
picturea he drew he kept a running
flre of talk going and this added much
to the effectiveness of this entertain
ment. A large part of hia program waa de
voted to caricatures and humorous
drawings, but In each, one could see
that there was something more than
to merely laught at, aa It was the pro
duct of some little practice and time
to perfect the genius for drawing so
rapidly. In his more artistic drawings
he covered a range of serious studies
in landscapes, marine views and other
color effects. A number of his pic
tures were lightning changes from one
scene to another and all was executed
with nn ease and grace that comes
with years of practice.
This is Mr. Colby's fourth year un
der the management of the ftedpatli
Lyceum Bureau. In many of the
places that he has appeared, such has
been the character of his work that th"
people have called for his return I
number of times. Before his enter
ing the lyceum and chautauqun field
he was a cartoonist on the staff of one
of the large papers In Chicago.
The next number of the course for
the year will be held in Thursday, De
cember 14, when the Savanroffs. a
company of Russian musicians now
touring the country will appear before
a Maysvllle audience. This company
in composed of three metrliers and
will present a program filled with life
and enthusiasm.
The High School Orchestra played
several selections before the opening
of the lecture by Mr. Colby. The or
chestra is -(imposed of a number of
the High School students and several
others. Their music was a great
treat.
