THAT MAY
Washington, Dec. 5. President Wil
un's address at the opening of the
ession of Congress today was whoi
y devoted to domestic subjects, prin
ipally thi problem of railway legis
ation. In the hall of the house with sena-
ors and representatives assembled in
ioint session, President Wilson, in ac
cordance with the custom he began at
he opening of his term, read his ad
lress from the clerk's desk.
The president not only renewed his
ecommendation for legislation to pre
sent a nation wide railway strike or
lockout before there has been oppor
tunity for investigation, but defended
t against the attack of organized la
jor as nothing arbitrary or unjust and
pe "justifiable safeguarding by socie
ty of the necessary processes of its
ife." -Aside
from recommendations for
the passage of the Porto Rico govern
ment bill, the corrupt practices bill
:nd the Webb bill to legalize American
collective selling agencies abroad, the
president's address was devoted whol
ly to the railroad situation. The only
feature which had not been forecast
was the elimination, of the proposal
that congress give explicit approval
to consideration by the Interstate
Commerce Commission of an increase
in freight rates to meet additional ex
penditures by the railroads caused by
the Adamson law.
Today, the president took the po
sition that "the power of hte Inter
state Commerce Commission to grant
an increase of rates an the ground re
ferred to is indisputably clear and a
recommendation by the congress with
regard to such a matter might seem
to draw in question the scope of the
commission's authority , or its inclina
tion to do justice when there is no
reason to doubt eithert"
The other recommendations on the
railroad situation made in a sepcial
message during the last session, which
were not put into law, were renewed
today. Mr. Wilson said:
TfTe Message
Gentlemen of the Congress:
, In fulfilling at this time the duty
jdid upon me by the constitution of
mmunjcating to you from time to
lime information of the state of the
Union and recommending to your con
sideration such legislative measures
as may be judged necessary and ex
pedient I shall continue the practice,
which I hope has been acceptable to
you, of leaving to the reports of the
several heads of the executive depart-
r
Iments the elaboration of the detailed
needs of the public service and confine
myself to those matters of more gen
eral public policy with which it seems
necessary and feasible to deal at the
J present session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my sug
gestions as few as possible; but there
3 were some things left undone at the
last Eession- which there will now be
time to complete and which it seems
necessary in the interest of the pub
lic to do at once.
In the first place, it seems to me
imperatively necessary that the earli
est possible consideration and action
should be accorded the remaining
measures of the programme of settle
ment and regulation which I had oc
casion to recommend to you at the
close of your last session in view
of the public dangers disclosed by the
-unaccommodated difficulties which
then existed, and which still unhappily
continue to exist, between the rail
roads of the country and their loco
motive engineers, conductors, and
trainmen. '

I 'ifgt, immediate provision for the

Commission along the lines embodied

According to Berlin, Over 15,000,000
Men Have Been Lost
by the Allies
(Associated Press)
Berlin, Dec. 5. The total losses of
the entente allies have been 15,100,000

Social Consequences of the War of
Copenhagen, as quoted by a semi
official news agency.
awaiting action by the Senate; in or
der that the commission may be en
abled to deal with the many great and
various duties now devolving upon it
with a promptness and thoroughness
which are, with its present constitu
tion and means of action, practically
impossible. -
Second, the establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basis alike
of work and of wages in the employ
ment of all railway employees who are
actually engaged in the work of oper
ating trains in interstate transporta
tion. . -
Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
sults in experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour day in railway trans
portation alike for the men and for
the. railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of the consideration bythe In
terstate Commerce Commission of an
increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures, by the rail
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary by the adoption of the ight
hour day and which have not been
offset by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the facts dis
closed justify the increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, concilation, and arbitration
of such controversies as the present by
adding to it a provision that, in case
the methods of Accommodation now
provided for should fail, a full public
investigation of the merits of every
such dispute shall be instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted.
Sixth, the lodgement in the hands
of the executive of the power, in case
cf military necessity, to take control
of such portions and such rolling stock
of the railways of the country as may
be required for military use and to
operate them for military purposes
with authority to draft into the mili
tary service of the United States such
train crews and administrative officals
as the circumstances require for their
safe and efficient use.
The second and third of these
recommendations the congress imme
diately acted on: it established the
eight-hour day as the legal basis of
work "and wages in train service and
it authorized the appointment of a
commission to- observe and report upon
the practical results, deeming these
the measures most (immediately need
ed; but it postponed action upon the
other suggestions until an opportuni
ty should be offered for a more delib
erate consideration of them. The
fourth recommendation I do not deem
it necessary to renew. The power of
the Interstate Commerce Commission
to grant an increase of rates on the
ground referred to. is indisputably
clear and , a recommendation by the
congress with regard to such a matter

MALCOLM GREATLY
REGRETS HIS, MISTAKE
In reporting the Thanksgiving
races for the Star, Malcolm Williams
ref ered to the winning mule as the
"unnamed son of Balaam." A preach
er, who by the way had no business
reading racetrack dope, censured Mal
colm for this genealogical perversion.
Malcolm searched the Scriptures and
on finding out what a gink Balaam
was felt like apologizing to the mule.
Here is his report of the last day's
races.
Friday's Races
The first race of the afternoon was
the 2:15 pace for Florida horses, and
brought out a field of four starters.
Little Hal was lucky in drawing the
pole; Charles R. C. D. got second po
sition, R. P. Little third place and
Deanwood outside. Little Hal got
away to some advantage in the first
heat which he won in 2:224, but after
that R. P. Little came' from behind and
won the other three heats.
The second race was the free for all,
mile heats, and brought out a field of
seven starters: Our Doctor, Maxie
Direct, Aristotle, Billy Farris, Cap
tain H., Nell Thorne and Flossie F.
This was unquestionably the largest
and bestfield of pacers ever gotten to
gether in Florida. The scoring for a
get-away was very tiresome, due
more perhaps to the drivers than the
horses, as each one of them knew that
to win the race he had to get away
good and hurry home. Nell Thorne, the
guideless wonder, drew the pole fori
this event; Aristotle second position,
Billy Farris third, Maxie Direct
fourth, Our Doctor fifth, Flossie F.
sixth, and Captain H. outside. The
get-away for the first heat was prob
ably the best one of the race. Nell
Thorne made a bid for the heat but
the. exhibition work and racing she had
done at Gainesville and Ocala for the
past two weeks had her jaded and she
finished third and was out of the mon
ey at the end the the race. Billy Far
ris won the first two heats with Maxie
Direct second each time. The third
heat was won by Flossie F., and as
darkness had overtaken us by this
time the race was declared ended. The
time for the first half was 1:04, the
other two being 1:05 each.
The third race of the afternoon was
the county race and had four entrfes:
Wilhelmina, Satan Wilkes, Zola Med
ium and Adeline. Wilhelmina was the
class of the field and won in straight
heats.
A Christinas Race
There are now between 25 and 50
horses quartered at the fair grounds,
and among them some real classy race
horses. Tampa and Orlando are in
viting these horsemen to come on to
their towns, but I have the assurance
of two or three of the visiting drivers
that they are not mad with me and to
prove it will stay in Ocala and put on
a matinee race Christmas if properly

Washington, Dec. 5. Congress was
asked today to appropriate $32,136,063
for improvement and maintenance
during the fiscal year of 1918 of riv
ers and harbors utilized in the nation's
water-borne commerce. That amount
is a reduction of almost $10,000,000
from the appropriations for the pre
vious year. Almost two-thirds of the
estimated expenditures are fo the
large rivers, and the port of New
York through which the greater part
of the country's foreign commerce
passes. For those projects the ag
gregate estimates, drawn by the chief
of engineers of the army under whose
charge the work is done, are:
Mississippi river, $10,552,000; Ohio
river, $5,000,000; Delaware river, $2,
150,000; Columbia river, $1,355,000;
Missouri river, $1,085,000; Hudson

CERTAIN If)
RUMANIA'S
(Associated Press)
The fate of Bucharest is apparently
sealed. The Russian official state
ment admitted the Rumanian attempts
to stop the Teutonic advance on Bu
charest and Polesoi have failed. P61
esoi is thirty-five miles north of
Bucharest, and the threat against it
seemingly means the speedy evacua
tion of Bucharest if the Rumanians
hope to make an effective retreat by
railroad toward Moldavia. ,N
The Teutons were reported twelve
miles south of Bucharest yesterday.
Berlin said the Rumanian first army
had been decisively defeated on the
Argechu, and declared the Ruman
ians in front of Bucharest were still
retreating and that the Teutons had
crossed the railroad from Bucharest to
Tergovistea.
Berlin said Russian attacks in the
wooded Carpathians and along Trans
ylvanian frontier failed yesterday, the
Teutons recapturing lost positions. In
the Danube lowlands the Russian at
tacks were declared to have been re
pulsed with heavy losses. The Teu
ions claim to have taken twelve thous
and five , hundred prisoners during
campaign.
The British attempted advance east
of the Albert-Warlencourt road, on the
Western front, was without success,
said Berlin.

MAXWELL FORCE HUNTS BIRDS
Mr. H. J. Lee, of Jacksonville, the
traveling representative of the Max
well Motor Sales Corporation, came
down Sunday evening in his Maxwell
roadster, to spend a few days with R.
Carroll,, the Maxwell dealer for
this part of the state. Mr. Lee came
ostensibly to hunt birds and not Max
well prospects. So Monday, Mr. Lee
and Messrs. Carroll and Baily, of the
Maxwell force, with Harley Reynolds
and his dogs and the two cars, went
to the woods and enjoyed a day's quail
shooting and found plenty of them.
This afternoon was spent in the same
pleasant manner and tomorrow fore
noon has the same schedule.
Tomorrow afternoon Mr. Lee will
drive through in his car to Jackson
ville. The growing business of the
Maxwell dealers in the state, which
has jumped from nothing in the past
two years to enormous proportions is
eeping Mr. Lee on the go almost
right and day, but he broke away
from it all for a few days of rest and
recreation. He was kind enough to
say of the Maxwell agency here that
it has never given him -any excuse to
come here on business, as things ran
so smoothly, so he had to come on
pleasure. However, after looking the
tuation over and seeing the sales
prospects that the agency had booked
for the next few weeks, a telegram
was sent this morning to Detroit,
ordering, out as fast as they could be
hipped, six double decked carloads
of six Maxwells each thirty-six
cars to be shipped during this month,
making by far the largest month's
shipment of automobiles that has ever
been shipped to Ocala. Mr. Lee is a
typical . Maxwell man, one of the finest
ever,-has. made a personal friend of
every dealer irthe state and is mak
ing friends wherever he goes.

ROLLIE IS WITH A
FAMOUS REGIMENT
The following letter from RoELie
Keating to Mr. Edward Tucker will
be of much interest to Mr. Keatingf'a
Ocala friends:
Seaford, Sussex, Eng., Nov. 11.
Dear Friend: I am now in charge of
the machine gun section of the
Princess Pats" and expect to go back
to France most any time in the next
few weeks. Was slightly wounded
and shell shocked last summer, but
am fit now to stand anything. It
takes more than a German to kill a
Florida cracker.
The Princess Patrica Canadian
Light Infantry, to which I am now at
tached is the most famous regiment
sent out of Canada. It was organized
at Ottawa the first, month of the war,
and made up of all old soldiers, not in
age, but in experience, men from all,"
parts of the globe soldiers of for
tune. They were the first Canadians
to see action and in their first battle
only 25 men were left out of 1250.
This was at Ypres. Since then we
have been recruited up to full strength .
three times and have been wiped out
three times. We have a record of
never being taken a prisoner. The
regiment is named after the beautiful
Princess Patricia of Connaught. Her
father, the duke, was the former governor-general
of Canada. She ' per
sonally looks after our interests and
comforts here. It is certainly a please
ure to fight under her colors and try
to hold up the reputation of our com
mand. Was up in Scotland for a week after
I came out of the hospital and had a
great time. Have been to London
quite often; our camp is not far from
there. It is certainly some town. I
often wish that I could have had some
of you Ocala boys with me in Paris
and London.
Do not know whether I will come
back after the war, or go down to
South Africa. Have had a good prop
osition made me to go to Capetown
and represent an American and Brit-
sh firm. I have the wanderlust now
and it will be hard to settle down in
a spot without excitement.
Yours sincerely, Rollie.

Co., P. P. C. L. I., Army Postoffice,
London, Eng. Any mail addressed
here will be forwarded either to camp
here or France.
