TOURIST RATE VICTORY
OF VAST IMPORT TO THE
STATE, SAY TWO MAYORS
•'Tlie decision of the interstate commerce
commission ln the tourist differential rate
rase comes at a psychological moment in the
history of Tacoma," said Mayor Fawcett
Tuesday.
"It would have meant much to the city at
any time; It means more now.
"With the proposed army post, and the
great shipbuilding industry that is centering
here added to the mountain and Its other
ecenic attractions, and a tourist rate that
does not discriminate against the northwest,
Tacoma may now count on a tourist travel
that will he one of its big asset*.
"I want to congratulate tlie Hcripps pa
pers on tlie public-spirited fight which they
almost alone made ftir the abolishment of
the unjust differential, and on the victory
which lias lieen won for tlie liencfit of Ta
coma and the whole northwest."

The great army training
camp enterprise- I" launched.
One month from now the
people of Pierce county eith
er will accept or relet the
government's offer to make
the American Lake site the
nation's chief military cen
ter.
Tlie Times is committed
whole-souled to help sec this
thing through.
We feel that it will lie one
of the very greatest assets
Tacoma ever acquired or
stands a chance to acquire
for many years to come.
When the subject first
came to my attention some
months ago, I am frank to
say, I regarded it with skepti
cism. I had seen land ?harp

The story of alleged wrongs

Glen Orr, wealthy Steilacoom

The case Is being fought bitter

The thing that is causing the
bitterest contest Is the alleged

and the girl a year ago, after Orr
had been arrested on a charge of
seduction, and after she had
agreed to drop her first breach of
promise suit against him.
She testified she signed this
agreement with the understanding
that it was a marriage contract,
only to find out later that it meant
HOPE TO SAVE
BUCHAREST YET
(I nitc.l Press trn.dl Wire.)
I/SNDON, Dec. s.—There is still
a chance that Bucharest will be
saved.
Military experts today hoped
that the Rumanian-Russian forces
now defending the capital to the
south, along the Argeshu river,
could hold the heavily reinforced
Invaders in check long enough to
permit of a few more days of
pounding by the Russians in the
Trotus river valley.
A break in the German line at
this point would put the main
railroad line from the north to
Kronstadt under serious menace.

RED MEN IN

The first of Mayor Fawcett's
army post committees to report for
action was Chinook Tribe No. 10,

"A messenger came to my house
at 11 o'clock last night," chuckled
the mayor Tuesday morning,
"with a letter saying they concur
red heartily in the ideas suggest
ed by me for securing the army
post, and tendering their services
to that end, and had appointed H.
J. McGregor to represent them and
to co-operate with me.
"That's the spirit that will
bring the post to Tacoma."

"I am delighted at the ready

Mayor Fawcett Tuesday.
Never has any bond proposi

which has met with such an en

"Of course, the city could
scarcely do anything else than
applaud the idea, because it
means so much to Tacoma and
the northwest.
"My telephone has been ring

anuounced the coming of the

"Business men, working men,

all call me up to tell me that
they will support the plan with

BACK ON MAP
S Tbe news story telling of the Pacific Northwest's tourist rate
I victory was completely overshadowed yesterday by the snnounee
■ incut of the V. S. army post plans. But. as a matter of fart the one is
M scarcely inferior to tbe other in its import of future prosperity for

H It operated this way: Tf a person at Chicago, Kansas City or oth
» er eastern city sought to buy a round-trip ticket to the coast, it would
1 e«.st hint $17 JM or $21.75, as the case might be, MORE IK HE CAME
J OR WENT BY THE NORTHERN ROUTES.
Bg It was a plain case of downright discrimination against the Pa
ra cific Northwest.
m The favoritism was all the more obvious and detestable because
Eg the rail distance from Chicago to San Francisco by way of Tacoma is
|§ several hundred miles less than by the southern route.
% This unjustifiable system in the last few years—and especially
H during the exposition year of 1915—robbed Tacoma and its neighbor
m cities of thousands of tourists, of hundred of thousands of tourist dol-
H lars worth of advertising and good will that the visit of these eastern-
H ers would have created.
W It will be recalled that Charles A. Reynolds, at that time chair
£ man of the state public service commission, suggested to The Times
S| and its allied papers that they combat this injustice. He pointed out f
«jj that for some strange reason even the northern railroads which,
m seemingly, were suffering by reason of the discrimination, were apa
|| thetic, and tlmt the leading commercial organisations of the North-
II west, which were accepting large railroad contributions, could not be
stirred into action.
With the backing of these papers, Reynolds prepared and filed
with the interstate commerce commission a complaint setting forth
the injury being done the Northwest, end, as the authorised repre
sentative of the Washington and Oregon commissions, argued the ease
last summer.
T J,ress dispatches that reached Tacoma late yesterday afternoon
announced I Complete victory for the Northwest. Excursion rates
hereafter must be the same whether the ticket calls for southern or
northern routes. The tourist flood gates thus are thrown wide open.
By coincidence, the news "broke" on the very day The Times
_ was jammed with the details of the great army post project, the most
Lportentious announcement of 30 years, and followed only 48 hours on
the heels of the news of the great Todd shipyard enterprise.
