TEN ROUND GO WITH CARPENTIER THE FRENCH CHAMPION

RUSSIA SAVES RUMANIA
AT CRITICAL MOMENT
PETROGRAD, Dec, 5. The timely
arrival of R'usalan troops before
Bucharest at the critical moment
when the Iohb of the capital seemed
almost certain has somewhat changed
the Rumanian situation. According
to military opinion here, the Ruma
nians 'now have at least a fighting
chance to retain their capital and
with the aid of the Russians, who
rendered tbelr first valuable assist
ance to the Rumanian defense by nnj
offensive In the Carpathians begun
Ave days ago, will now attempt to
Include Bucharest In the zone which
they are able to defend, establishing
a permanent line north and west of
the capital.
According to Information received
here from Bucharest, ythe German
plan of encircling Bucharest was
perilously near to accomplishment
when it struck an unexpected ob
stacle In the form of a Russian force
between Bucharest and the Danube.
A flanking movement was partially
successful, when the Teutonic forceB
advancing from Lake Greca encoun
tered a sudden stiffening In the re
sistance tf the Rumanians, due to
the arrival of Russian troops, and
H44t -
were compelled to retire In disorder.
Emplacements already had been com
pleted for the big guns which were
to bombard the Bucharest fortifica
tions. Executing a hasty retreat, the
Germans and Bulgarians had to aban
don guns of all calibers and a large
quantity of war materials. The
Northern Teutonic allied group, which
is attempting to flank Bucharest from
the side of Piteshti, has proceeded
with greater success, but the Ru
manians have managed to retreat
without losing connection with the
force defending the western fortifica
tions of the capital.
