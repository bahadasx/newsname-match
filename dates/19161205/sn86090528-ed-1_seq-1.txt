Topics Touched on by Executive
By United Pros.
Washington, Dec. 5. Following the
precedent he established when lie
first assumed his executive duties in
tho White HoiiHe, President Wilson
today appeared before a joint session
of congress and personally outlined
legislation he hopes to have enacted
by that body. Itt was tho third time
he has addressed the sixty-fourth con
gress. Because the makeup of the next
house may result in hard sledding for
Democratic measures, the president
hoped, by his appeal today, to con
vince this congress ot the importance
of immediate action on legislation he
particularly desires.
The executive box in the house gal
lery was reserved for Mrs. Wilson
and other members of the president's
family. Members 'of the cabinet, also
were there.
While congress Is working on his
recommendations the president will be
away from Washington but little.
Should it be necessary he mav recom
mend that the customary Christmas
recess be dispensed with. This sug
gestion has been made already by
Speaker Clark and Chairman Fitzger
ald of the house appropriations com
mitiee. There is much to do before March 3,
the date of adjournment, if the presi
dent's wishes are to be carried out in
full at this time and not entrusted to
the sixty-fifth congress.

Suffrage Army Ready.
By United Press.
Washington, Dec. 5. The front line
of the army of woman suffrage form
ed here today for the "big push" on
congress to force through the Susan
B. Anthony amendment at this short
session.
Thet Initial move of the campaign
depends largely upon whether the at
titude of President Wilson which
leans toward state instead of federal
action has at all changed. Some suf
frage workers believe it has, that it
may be passed on promptly to the
states for ratification.
The following official statement was
made today by the Union through the
T'nitnrt PrPKM- "The feeline is eeneral
that a demand for a federal amend
ment should be pressed much more in
sistently than heretofore in view of
the previous delay of congress in deal
ing with the measure.
"The case for national suffrage has
been unanswerably presented. The
movement has been endorsed by wo
men votoje at the polls and there is
only one answer the administration
can give, namely the passage of a fed
eral amendment at this session. The
women are not in a mood to brook
delay.
"We are confident the attitude of
the administration will he favorable,
because the Democratic party to main
tain itself must look to tho west. It
cannot hold the west without the wo
men voters; and to win their support
must aid woman suffrage."
Miss Anne Martin of Nevada, na
tional chairman of the woman's party
Is in charge of the campaign.

CO. LOSES
$1,300 BY
DECISION About $250,000 Slate Building Bonds,
Non-Assessable, Held by Grady
County Banks
The recent decision of tho supreme
court of the state ot Oklahoma holding
that state building bonds were not tax-
able will cost Grady county between
$G00 and $700 a year in cold cash for
the years 1315 and 191C.
An order of the county commission
ers at its present sitting instructed
that no collections be made on this
item.
It is estimated that about $250,000
in state bonds were rendered for as
sessment by the banks in Grady coun
ty, one bank in Chickasha having
$180,000 of the bonds in its possession.
The average rate of taxation for the
county would bring the revenue from
tills source between $600 and $700 a
year.

The next prosecutions) which are

be oi those persons who have neglect

to the city officials and costs the for

Traffic Officer Sammy Dwyer today
W.-.rcJ tliat he would soon begin
making arrests of those persons who
are driving cars without registering
them at the city hall. A phono call
to the city clerk is all that is neces
sary to accomplish this result. Those
neglecting to attend to this are likely
to pay a fine at any time now.
The absence of small boy and girl
drivers of late is noticeable. "WTe
haya decided to place under arrest
all children under the age of sixteen
who are driving cars in Chickasha,"
continued Sammy, "and have been on
the lookout for them for some days.
But this practice has been almost
wholly discontinued. No child under
sixteen can drive an automobile unat
tended by a licensed driver within the
city limits."

Strategical Army Consists of Only Three
Divisions Whereas World Has Been
Told It Was Overwhelming
HUMAN LIFE DRAINED
BY LONG VERDUN SIEGE
Austria Long Credited With
Strategical Force Also is
Found to Be Weak
Strone
(By Henry Wood, United Press Staff
correspondent with the French ar
mies.)
In the Field, France, Nov. 10. (By
mail.) Following the sacrifice ot over
500,000 men at Verdun and the terrible
losses sustained on the Somiuc, Ger
many is reduced today to such a scarc
ity of men that she has only three di
visions or about 45,000 men, left for
her strategical reserve. Austria is In
precisely tho same condition, ' the
troops being held in reserve by her
not exceeding three divisions.
This iiiLorniation, with supporting
evidence, was placed at my disposition
today to refute the claims made re
cently by Germany and Austria that
they are holding in reserve a large
strategical army which will bo flung
at a given moment on the particular
point whore they wish to engage a de
cisive battle.
That this condition was brought
abount largely through Germany's ob
stinacy in keeping up the six months
attack at Verdun was confirmed to
me by the same source. The intelli
gence department of the French armyjaml chihuahua, Cily is open and It is
has been able definitely to ascertain
this.

nd the detention of Wills, Roy spent
several hours about the city prison

; unteered to steal a key for one of the

declined the proposal.
Later he was conveyed to the county

caped from the Jailer's room, where
ho was given the liberty of the grounds
while the jailer was busy with prison
ers on the inside. Owing to the ex

tured by officers down town and re
