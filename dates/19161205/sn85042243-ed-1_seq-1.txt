Third Time
MUCH UNFINISHED
BUSINESS REMAINS
Executive-Elect Given Demonstra­
tion As He Appears Upon
Rostrum
By ROBERT J. BENDER
(United Press Staff Correspondent).
(Text of ipessage on page four).
Washington, Dec. 5—Following
the precedent he established when he.
first assumed his executive duties in
the White House, President Wilson
today appeared before a joint session
of congress and presonaily outline,d
legislation he hopes to have enacted
by that body. It was the third time
he lias addressed the sixty-fourth con­
gress.
Because the makeup of the next
house may result in hard sledding for
Democratic measures, the president
hoped, by his appeal today, to con­
vince this congress of the importance
of immediate action on legislation he
particularly desires.
The executive box in the house gal­
lery was reserved for Mrs. Wilson and
other members of the president's fam­
ily. Members of the cabinet, also
were there.
While congress is working on his
recommendations the president will
be away from Washington but little.
Should it 'be necessary he may recom-j
mend that the customary Christmas
recess be dispensed with. This sug­
gestion has been mode "already by
Speaker Clark and Chairman Fitzger­
ald of the house appropriations com­
mittee.
There is much to do before March
3. the date of adjournment, if the pres­
ident's wishes* are to be carried out
in full at this time and not entrusted
to the sixty-fifth congress.
SUFFRAGIST8 DROP
BANNER AS WILSON
READS HIS MESSAGE
Washington, Dec. 5.—The
first demonstration by suffrag­
ists, such as heckled the Bfit
ish house of commons, occur­
red on congress today, while
President Wilson was reading
his annual message.
Soon after the president
started reading it, a big yel­
low silk banner was dropped
by suffragists from the gallery.
The inscription read:
"President Wilson, what will
you do f$r woman suffrage?"
BASE NUN
PLEA OK IT
OF THE STORK
(Special to The.Tribune).
Casselton, N. D., Dec. 5.—Peti­
tions were circulated here today
asking President Wilson to par­
don William F. Kittel, former
banker who shortly will be sent­
enced for participation in the af­
fairs of the First Natioiftl bank
of this city.
The fact that the stork just vis­
ited the Kittel home is respon­
sible for the plea going to the
president.
Washington, Dec. 6—First con­
gressional action to relieve the high
cost of living occurred today when
Representative Keating made a mo­
tion to amend his bill to provide for
an investigation of the cost of living
among the wage earners of the Dis­
trict of Columbia.

est economic organization of agricul­
turists in the world—the Farmers' Ed­
ucational union. The annual state
convention of this association will

delegates and scores of visitors from
all parts of the state. It will also

nent in farmers' economic movements
the country over.
Chairman of Board.
One of the big men of the program
which begins at 10 o'clock tomorrow
morning, is L. M. Rhodes of Tennes­
see, chairman of the national board
of directors, an orator of real power,
and whose message will form the
principal address of the day.
Another top-liner will be Sam
Hampton of Montana, the first state
organizer for Texas. W. B. Evenas
will 'tell of the splendid progress
which the organization is making in
this state, and there will be some in­
teresting introductory remarks from
•R. J. J. Monthomery of Tappen, pres­
ident of the .North Dakota Farmers'
union. The program will be featured
by selections from the perennially
popular Bismarck male quartet.
Committee on Resolutions.
Following the address by J. E.'Kel­
ly, former congressman from South

resolutions was named by 'President
J. M. Anderson: ^August Nelson, Cros­
by, N. D. Eenjamin Drake, .'Minne­
apolis, Minn. F. A., Bennett, Great

remaining days of the convention.
Plan Tribute to Loftus.
President Anderson announced that
plans are being made now for a fit­
ting tribute during the convention to
the memory of the late George S.
Loftus, one of the founders fthe
Equity Co-operative exchange.
"It was for our cause," said Ander­
son, "that George S. Loftus gave his
life. It vbs he who conceived the
idea of the first Equity convention,
held here three years ago, and who
was the stimulating figure fthat
meeting. I lldN'®
"Last year he rose from his bed,
where he had lain a year, and came to
see the breaking of ground for the
Equity elevator, for which he strug­
gled and worked and gave his life."

IS QUESTION OF LAW AND
GOVERNMENT, SAYS BRUCE
Next Chief Justice Declares Fund*
amental Questions Are In
volved
It became evident today that there
iB great probability of the next act in
the supreme court drama being defer­
red until Thursday, when the provi­
sional court, composed of five district
judges, sits to determine which trio
of contestants has a legal right to
serve .during the remainder of Decem­
ber.
Justices Robinson and Grace, who
had been in the city since Sunday eve­
ning, were joined at noon today by
Luthef E. Birdzell of Grand iForks,
the third justice-elect, and by William
Lemke, of Fargo, chairman of the Re­
publican state central committee, and
whb is said to be slated for an import­
ant post in connection with the new
court. They found that the state can­
vassing board would not convene un­
til two this Afternoon, and that there
was little chance of any certificates of
election being issued before Wednes­
day, and some possibility that none
would issue^until Thursday.
No Certificates Here.
As a matter of fact, the secretary
of state has no certificates to issue.
They were ordered from the engrav­
er some time ago and are now on
their way. Until they arrive, none of
of the candidates who were success­
ful in the recent election can be sup
plied with a formal certificate of elec­
tion.
Much Work to Do.
The state board of canvassers has
a lot of work ahead of it. It must can­
vass the vote on all state, legislative,
non-partisan judiciary, non-partisan
school, district judiciary, referendum
and constitutional amendment ballots.
Even though the returns are now all
typewritten in tabular form, the mere
ta£k of reading them over and check­
ing theiq up will consume the balance
of today and .probably all of tomorrow.
No exception will be made in the is­
suance of certificates, it was announc­
ed this morning. All will go out to­
gether.1 Therefore, it is probable that
the justices-elect cannot demand,
their seats on the strength of election
certificates earlier than Thursday. By
that time, the controversy will be in
the hands of the specially constituted
supreftie' court.
Crawford to Act.
W. C. Crawford .of Dickinson will
be the fourth member of the special
supreme court, D. Hoskins, clerk
of the court, announced this morning.
The fifth member is yet to*be selected.
The bench will be occupied for this
occasion by District Judges W. L.
Nuessle of the Sixth, Charles A. Pol­
lock of the Third, J. M. Hanley of the
Twelfth and W. C. Crawford of the
Tenth, with one other, probably W. J.
Kneeshaw of tfie Seventh, yet to be
named.

Sends Notice of Withdrawal to
Premier Asqnith Says
Report-

UPON NiSW CABINET
Information Gomes To United
Press Upon Highest
Authority
London,Dec. 5.—'Upon the highest
authority, The United Press learns
that David Lloyd-George has resign­
ed from the cabinet. His resignation
was drafted and sent to Asquith Im­
mediately after he received the inti­
mation that Asquith was unwilling to
agree to the plan for the reconstruc­
tion of the war council, of which ,the
premier was to have been a member.
Premier Asquith said, however, that
whatever reconstruction of the gov?
ernment was- decided upon there
would be no departure from the pol­
icy announced at the 'beginning of the
war. Asquith's own statement at this
time held that England was in the
war to compel the restoration of Bel­
gium and until such time as German
militarism was subdued and the in­
tegrity of small nations assured.
The reconstruction of the British
government must be taken as an em­
phatic reiteration of the British de­
termination to fight to a bitter finish.
In all the maze of discussion of the
manner in which the reconstruction
be framed thi^ fact stood out. The
public demands precipitated the cabi­
net crisis, the cabinet members said.
The public demanded a more vigorous
conduct of the war for a more com­
pact organization to direct it and a re­
construction of possibility and power.
It is conceded that from the crisis
will come an organization of a com­
pact war council, probably to consist
of not over five members, to be given
supreme direction of England's war
energies.

WILSON FOR
Urges Appointment of Commission
to Investigate the High
Cost of Living
WILSON HAS HAD HATTER
UNDER CONSIDERATION
Believed That He Will Send a
Special Message to Congress
for Action
ASKS FOR SPEED.
Washington, Dec. 5.—Senator
Martin today offered a joint reso­
lution in the senate, urging Pres­
ident Wilson to spur congress on
to immediate action in fighting
the high cost of living.
Washington, Dec. 5.—Appointment
of a federat commission to investigate
the hight cost of living was urged on
President Wilson yesterday by a com­
mittee representing the American Fed­
eration of Labor, led by Samuel Gom
pers.
The president said he felt deep con­
cern over the situation caused by in­
creased prices of foodstuffs and was
giving the question-serious considera­
tion. He did not disclose what he in­
tends to do, although he has under
consideration a special message to
congress on the question.
The president objected to the plan
of a commission without congression­
al authority, on the ground that it
would not have power to compel wit­
nesses to testify.
The committee of labor leaders left
the White House, however., under the
impression 'that the president would
take some step to meet the situation.
Presented to Congress.
One embargo resolution would pro­
hibit exportation of any farm product
or manufactured foodstuffs for one
year. The other would empower the
president to suspend exportations
whenever prices 'became extortionate
and public interests require. iBoth
'bills would provide for shipment of
food to Americans abroad or to peo­
ples made destitute by the war, pesti­
lence or other extraordinary eventB.
Interstate transportation of cold
storage foods, unless the date of stor­
age is distinctly marked, would be
prohibited, together with an arbitrary
prohibition of interstate transporta­
tion of any product in col dstorage
more than ten months, except butter,
which might he held longer.
A bill for free transportation of
wheat for seed was introduced by
Representative Steenerson of Minne­
sota. It is intended to supply seed
for the Red River valley, which has
been drawing on Canada, Russia, Hun­
gary and Rumania.
Secretary Red field today sent a re­
port on food prices to the White
'House, which is understood to show
wide differences between the prices
paid to producers and those paid iby
consumers. For the time being the
report is considered confidential and
will be held with many others being
made for the president.

Fargo, N. D., Dec. 5.—Governor-elect
Lynn J. Frazier, in Fargo yesterday,
on his way to St. Paul and Chicago,
dropped the word that there will bo
no inaugural ball at Bismarck on the
opening of the legislature and the
seating of the new administration this
winter.
The governor-elect is brief and ex­
plicit in his explanation:
"We have got to get down to busi­
ness without any frills or loss of time
or useless pomp," he said.
The inaugural ball has been the big
biennial feature of the social season
at the state capital since the memory
of man runneth not to the contrary.
To it have flocked the wealth and
beauty of the capital, and of all the
state, for that matter. However, in
abolishing it. Governor Frazier will
have eminent precedent.

thousands to' St. Paul today. ttf attend
the seedfid annual convention of the
National Equity Grain and Livestock
Growers association.
Five thousand attendance at the
convention, which lasts from today
until Thursday, is anticipated. Al­
though the majority of these come
from Nbrth Dakota, Minnesota and
South Dakota, every state in the west
and midiUewest was represented by
the terrific influx that started today.
Some registrations from the Pacific
coast states Were made today.
Dedication of Elevator.
One of the leading events of the con­
vention is the dedication' of a $500,000
grain elevator on the upper levee of
the Mississippi river tomorrow. This
elevator marks the culmination of
North Dakota's bitter fight, which
merged into a political battle at which
farmers won. Ugly jcharges against
the Minneapolis chamber of com­
merce were, hurled during the fight.
This elevator is designed to compete
with the Minneapolis concern, and
speculative marketing.
Two resolutions were placed before
the convention immediately upon, its
being called to order by President J.
M. Anderson. Equity Co-operative ex­
change, at 10 a. m. today, at St. Paul's

tions called for an interstate com­
merce commission investigation of al­
leged excessive demurrage charges,
to be effective next spring, and of the
present car shortage.
A member of President Wilson's
cabinet is expected to attend the ded­
ication of the Equity elevator tomor­
row. Robert Bridges, president of the
Seattle port commission, and C. J.
Brandt, chief of the department of
agriculture, will conduct the dedica­
tion service.
Frazier is Speaker.
Stick together was the keynote of
Lynn F'razief's address before the
convention. Frazier is the only real
farmer governor in the United States.
He said it was necessary for the far­
mers politically to stick together.
"Last spring I was the most sur­
prised man in the state when inform­
ed I was nominated as the farmer can­
didate for governor. I wouldn't have
won, but for the farmers and their loy­
al crowd—and they stuck. The boss­
es of the old party said these farmers
won't stick: they can't they never
will—but they did.
Co-operate Politically.
"We always have Sought to co-oper­
ate on marketing, but now we must
co-operate politically. The Non-Parti
san league formation is the result of
the awakening. Now we are on top
in North Dakota and we are trying to
help other northwest farmers to get
on top in their states."
500,000 Buschels Grain Handled.
