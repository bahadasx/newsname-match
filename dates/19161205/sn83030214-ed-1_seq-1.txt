A merchant who sued The Tribune
for $60,000 damages because this news
paper in the course of its rampa .
honest advertising called him a "dealer
in rug?, furniture, fake?, frauds arid
sssindles in a large and commodious ;
pitfall" on Fifth Avenue, yesterday got!
an award of six cent? from a jury in
Justice (iiegerich's part of thl
preme Court.
verdict is regarded a.? a notable
victory for the cause of honesty in ad?
rig and dealing which The Tiib
baa espoused and fough? for
through the series of article? v. I
I y Samuel Hopkins Adams and pub?
lished in the column? of tins newspa?
per for many months. The Tribune's !
fearless exposure of misrepresentation
in advertising and its public condemna?
tion of fake and deceptive methods
were upheld by the court and jury'.
The case decided yesterday irai the
first of several libel suits against Tho ;
Tribune, based upon the Adams arti- !
cli-s. to come to a court decision. The
attempt of the plaintiff in this action ,
to obtain damages against this news
paper because it dared to shed the
light ?>-* truth upon his particular'
methods of trade in dealing with tit ? |
public resulted in absolute fa
Damage?? Sought Fice-cd $1,000,000
The other actions pending are based
on grounds similar to those taken in
this suit. All are the hacktlare of The |
Tribune's efforts through the "Ad-1
Visor" to rid the city of the svidespread '
use of misleading advertising and de-;
ceptive methods of making salts of
merchandise. The aggregate demands
for damages in these suits amount toi
more than $1,000,000. Intermediate pro- .
ccedings have been taken and various
motions made in some of them, hut the
case in hand was the first to come to
trial.
Briefly, the case was this: Jacob If. I
Harris, a dealer in rugs, furniture and
similar merchandise at IM and _.''h
Piftfa Avenue, sued The Tribune for
libel on the basis of an article by Mr.'
Adams published in Februars, 1915, in
which it was stated in substance that
Fifth Avenue had been invaded by sev?
eral persons, including Harris, with
past bad records of engaging in Illegiti?
mate atid shoddy trade.
The article then alleged thai Harris
after the "invasion," conducted Ins
business in i-uch a manner that his '
shop became a pit ft*] 1 of fakes, frau'ls
Hnd swindles, arid it was on thi? part
of the article that Harris ?ued.
The outcome of the Harris action
al^er two weeks' trial before a jury
which evidently considered that the
substance of The Tribune's charges
was proved, is regarded a? having sig?
nificant bearing upon the other suits
which are pending. It is held to show
the futility of the effort.? of dealers
whose methods have been exposed by
The Tribune to muizle newspapers
which are seeking to bring about bet?
ter advertising and merchar
ditions. The verdict is con? nl? red a
severe .setback to merchants who are
trying to mulct The Tribune for heavy
damages because the-, were exposed to
?he light of truth.

Russian Relief Plan Fails
There is no longer any doubt of the
failure of the Russian movements in
the Carpathians and Dobrudja to divert
the Teutonic commanders from the
campaign against Bucharest, or even to
change any of their carefully laid plans.
It is only a matter of hours before the
city falls.

Then, joining hands, the two armies

BELGIANREL?F
WORK IN PERIL
Allies Warn World
That Germans Have
Broken All Pledges
London, Dec, 4. - The British govern?
ment, in conjunction with Britain's
Allies, has issued a "declaration re?
garding the present state of Belgium,"
in which protest is made to the civ?
ilized svorld against the "slave raids"
conducted by the German authorities
in Belgium, and a warning given to the
ssorld that "the ssork of relief which
neutrals have built up is in danger of
falling."
The document, after reciting the as?
sistance the Fr?tente Allies have given
in the past in the work of relief in
Belgium, ?a
"The Allies stipulated that the Ger?
mans should equally draw no advantage
from the operations of the neutral
commission; that tbey should not seize
imported or native supplies, and that
the distribution of relief should not
be used for the purpose of coercing Bel?
gian svorkmen against their consciences.
German Pledges Broken
"These conditions, which the Ger?
mans were pledged to obey, have been
frequently violated. But the infrac?
tions in the past have been disavowed
by the German government and the
Allies have been content to rely upon
the neutral commissian to watch and
enforce the fulfilment of the condi?
tions under which it worked.
"Now, however, the situation M
changing. The Germans have aban?
doned all pretence of respecting per?
sonal freedom in Belgium. They have
deliberately ordered the suspension of
the public relief works supported by
the commission, and openly aimed at
creating unemployment, which fur?
nishes them an excuse for deporta?
tions.
"They have become themselves the
organizers and ?operators in man
hunts which they pledged themselves
by the Brussels convention of 1890 to
put down in Africa. The machinery of
Belgian industry is now totally de?
stroyed and exports of Belgian food?
stuffs have again begun on a large
scale.
Relief Work In Hanger
"The Allies must therefore warn the
world of what is about to take place.
The Central Empires, as their own sit?
uation grows more desperate, intend to
tear up every guarantee on which the
work of the relief commission rest?.
They intend to cast aside all their
promise? ?nd U3e Belgian foodstuffs
and Belgian labor to support their own
failing strength. The work of relief
which the neutrals have built up for
two years is about to lose its founda?
tion and is in danger of falling.
"The Allies do not intend to change
their policy or desert the oppressed
population of Belgium in this most
critical moment of the war, but as it
will be impossible for the relief work
to continue if its basic guarantees are
destroyed they appeal to the civilized
world not on their own behalf, but on
behalf of innocent civilians, who can?
not protect themselves, to see that this
great work of international benevolence
and cooperation, which has grown up
?mid the war arid for which the Al?
lies have sdvanced money, shall not
he ?ndangered by treachery or de?
stroyed by violence.
Other Territories Involved
"But they remind 'he world that the
German policv which stands revealed
-.? being carried out not only in Bel?
gium, but in North France .
occupied territories. The Allies 1
themselves not to seek in the future
any more than in the past any advan?
tage from the operation.? of this purely
neutral commission."

Constantine Is Blamed

Attacks
BELIEVED TO PLAN

Accused of Setting Trap in
Athens?Expects Mack
ensen to Aid
[Br Cast? B ti.? Mbtst?]
London, Dec. 4.?It would cause
no surprise here if the Allies' next
step in Grate?, were seizure of the
reins of government and the direc?
tion of Greek policy.
As a preliminary measure public
opinion here favors an absolute
blockade of Greece. A government
order issued to-day, forbidding the
sailing of Greek vessels from British
to Greek ports evidently is the result
of the new policy.
The Allies are plainly chagrined
at the way King Constantine has
outmanoeuvred them in the latest de?
velopments. Lord Robert Cecil, in
< the House of Commons to-day, de?
scribed the situation as one of "ex?
treme gravity."
Hint? at Direct Action
Alluding to the "treacherous and
unprovoked attack upon Allied de?
tachments in Athens," he declared
that the Allies held King Constan
tine's government responsible, and
! were considering immediate meas?
ures to secure a radical solution of
, the entire question.
Obsen*ers here read into this an
: nouncement the first result of the
? agitation for a more vigorous prose
' cution of the war that has brought
! on a Cabinet crisis. There were
' many protests yesterday over Four
! net's failure to exact compliance
with the full terms of his ultimatum.
According to some special dispatches
' of the Athens correspondents filed on
I Sunday at Piraeus, where the Allies
| control the telegraph lines, the situa
j tion in Greece is one justifyiyng Cecil's
! statement.
Say King Set Trap
These dispatches represent that last
I week's fighting in Athens was the result
! of "a deliberate trap, treacherously pre?
pared by the King and the government,"
' 26,000 troops being disposed around the
', position which Vice Admiral Du Four
' net had previously notified the Greek
i government he would occupy.
These troops then attacked the Al
I lies, who numbered 3,000. The latter
fought until their ammunition was ex?
hausted ar.d then yielded, except a de?
tachment of 100, who tried to cut their
I way through. Only thirty of these es?
caped.
Preparing for War
I According to the same accounts, King
Constantine is quietly mobilizing and
preparing for war against the Allies,
intending to coop? te with a sectioj
of Field Marshal v . Mackensen's
forces, which is expected at the Mona
stir front, by attacking General Sar
rail's flank. It is also stated that th?
Greeks are advancing on Pireeus.
Cecil's statement is believed to beat
only one meaning - direct action in
Athens. Fresh fuel was added to the
flames by to-day's news from the (?reek
capital.
According to a dispatch to "The
Star." some of Constantine's troops,
without warning, opened tire with ma?
chine guns on Vice-Admiral du Four
net and a group of French officer?
standing on the steps of the Zappeion
last Friday. Six officers fell wounded
at the first volley.
Besieged All Da>
The French marines were reinforced
by 2M) British marines, who marched to
the Zappeion unhindered. The two
force? ?wiftly organized a defence and
held out all day against a superior
force equipped with artillery.
Two Red Cross nurses, who escaped
to F'lrarus, told how th? Royalist?
heaped indigr.itie.i upon them, though
they were wearing the Red Croa? uni?
form. The nurses said that Venizelists
;r. Athens were receiving the most
brutal treatment. The premises of the
British Embassy were the scenes of
many insult?, they declared.
tireek military patrols g-uard the
shores of Patras day and night to pre?
vent volunteer? joining the National
?st movement, while acc?s? to boat?
and trains is forbidden any soldier not
provided with a spec:?! military per?
mit.
Representative? Abroad Resign
The attitude of Greeks outside
Greece, toward Constantine is ?hown in
the resignations of the Greek ministers
in London and Pan? and the Greek
con?ul? in Manehe?ter and Liverpool,
all of whom declared that th?y could
no? ?upport th? King any longer.

SAYS PRESENT METHOD
WILL NOT WIN THE WAR
Lonaan, Dec. 4. --Ifter
Suggesting that the people
choose H4F-P rulers through a
general election, "The Man
rhreter truardian" tayt:
Th*re are, in fact, two
crises, for the crisis in the
ministry is but a reflection of
the crisis in the war. The
crisis in the war amounts to
this: That the progress of
events and succession of
bitter experiences have at
last brought home to the
minds of most men the fact
that we are not winning the
war. and the further fact
that, with the present meth?
ods of waging the war, we
shall never win it.
GERARD, SAILING
TO-DAY, DENIES HE
HAS PEACE PLAN
Proposals for Ending the War
Must Come from Great
Britain. Says Envoy
James W. Gerard, United States Am?
bassador to Germany, will ?ail thin
morning on the Frederik VIII en route
I to hi? po?t in Berlin, after a brief va
] cation in this country. The ambassa
j ?lor last night denied that he would
I take with him a Drooosal of peace medi?
ation between Germany and her ene
. mies or that he would take any steps
toward ending the war.
Count Reventlow, according to an
; Amsterdam dispatch, had asserted in
i the "Tageszeitung" that Ambassador
Gerard would bring a peace proposal
"the main point? of which have been
; already agreed upon by Washington
? and London."
"I am carrying no peace proposal?;
! those, it seems to me, must com? from
Great Britain," said Ambessador Ge
' rard.
"Do you think such a proposal by the
I United States would be valueless?" he
' was asked.
"Put that up to the State Depart
1 ment," he replied.
Somewhere in the ambassador's bag?
gage when h? sails to-day will be the
| equivalent of 100,000 marks, which svas
raised through a Thanksgiving Day ap
j peal issued by the American Ri'lief
i Committee, of which former Mayor
? George B. McHellan is chairman and
, John ?. Crimmins treasurer. This
I money s*/ill be distributed through the
i mhassy to needy widows, orphans and
other war sufferers in Berlin.

Rv \KTHl I S. DRAPER
London, D??c. 4.?Out of the wel?
ter of rumors and conflicting state?
ments concerning the political crisis
there arc a few points that can ba
?tated with some degree of positive
ness:
Lloyd George has won a decisiva
i victory.
Premier Asquith cither has re?
signed or probably will resign, to
become Loni High Chancellor, with
i an annual salary of $50,000.
Runciman and McKenna will un
i doubtedly leave the Cabinet.
The ministry will be entirely re
; organized, with Lloyd George as
Premier.
Parliament has adjourned until
' Thursday or next Monday.
The situation is changing so rap?
idly that even these statements are
liable to alteration, for the victory
i of the Opposition is so complete, so
sudden and of such magnitude and
responsibility that it demands a cau?
tious pause for consideration.
Premier Asquith saw the King
again to-day, and later told tha
House of Commons, in a brief ses?
sion, that his majesty had approved
the request for the reconstruction of
the government.
Will Nat Change Policy
The Premier added that the recon?
struction would not change in any way
the policy pursued by the government
j ?ince the beginning of the war. He
said he thought the appointment of a
food dictator and all other questions
' as to personnel should be postponed
' until the reconstruction had been com?
pleted.
All the minist?re are believed to have
handed in their resignations. The state?
ment in the House by Sir James Henry
Dalziel, Liberal member for Kircaldy
Burghs, that the re?ig-natiotis of all
, the Cabinet were in the Premier's
hands brought forth no denial from
Mr. Asquith. Apparently there has been
1 no agreement as to the details of th?
: reconstruction, and a full explanation
'of the solution will be withheld until
' further negotiations have taken place.
The general public is entirely at sea
concerning the situation. All day long
i politicians and ?tateamen raced from
; place to place seeking the latest re
' port?.
(la If oar and Lanadowne To Go
Prom a well Informed source I learn
that Premier Asquith has re?igned, but
'will continue in office for a few days;
that I/ord Derby fa to be the new War
Secretary, and that neither Balfour nor
Lanadowne will be included in the new
Cabinet.
All the slates include Lloyd George,
Bonar Law, Sir Edward Car?on and
Ixjrd Derby, but for th? rest of the
, ministry there are as many name? a?
' there are prophets. Moat agre? that
Lloyd George will not continue in
charge of the War Office.
The strength of the opposition move
! ment came mostly from independent
peers, such as the Duke of Norfolk and
Lords Middleton. Sydenham, Desert,
? Loreburn and Beresford. It is under?
stood that the present government has
fewer than forty supporter? in the
upper house. Balfour and Lansdown?
are both reported Buffering from cold?,
1 but it is significant that they are the
only I'nionist leaders not among thos?
who are ?uggesting that Premier Aa?
qutth resign.
Asquith Asks Adjournment
A.! the prominent figures in th?
crisis, with the sole exception of Lloyw
Ceorge, were at hand when Premier As
quith made his announcement. Fol?
lowing his statement, th? Premier sug?
gested that the House adjourn aftei
the day's busine.?? until Thursday, h
reply to the suggestion for a longai
adjournment to allow discussion of thl
situation. Mr. Aaqutth said:
"I de.sire to make it perfectly plali
to the House and to th? country tha
whatever reconstruction of th? Cabl
".*'. takes place, it involves no d?par
ture la any shape from the policy al
ready announced and pursued ?ince th<
beginning of the war. If : ny one en
courages or entertain* th.? idea tha
there is any question of a ehang? o
policy, I can assure them that the
are entirely mistaken."
The motion to adjourn until Thar?
, day was carried after the Premier ha
', announced that the first business o
the House on that day would be th
vote of credit, which would give th
member* opportunity to discu?a an
I question.
