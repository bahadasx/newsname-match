working In a country store at $nlorn, j

"Four dollars a barrel." was Mr. H

Mr. Archbold was the first man *f
among his associates to whom Mr. |
Rockefeller pays tribute in his J
reminiscences. Among other things, ; j j
"Mr. Archbold has always had a I
well developed sense of humor, and <3
on one ocaalon, when be was on the
witness stand, ho was asked by the j
" 'Mr. Archbold. are you a director A
" 'What Is your occupation in this
" 'To clamor for dividends.' "
It haB been estimated that his for-- tune,
made almost entirely in oil arid:;?
Its by-products, was nearly $100,- H
Mr. Archbold was one of the best
informed men in tho details of the oil
business in all Its branches, and he
held, according to his own statement,
that all the practices of the Standard
Oil Company wore honorable, and,

in defending the trust Idea, "for cooperative
evolution. I believe that

Although .Mr. Archbold was not**fi
particularly conspicuous as a benefao-;
tor, he made many, -large, gifts,;
eluding a sum of $100,000 to Syracuse
