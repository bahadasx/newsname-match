As Closely Identified with it
as Rockefeller—Funeral

Tarrytown, N. Y„ Dec. 5.—A noted
figure In the world's petroleum In
dustry was removed today, when John
Dustin Archbold, capitalist and pres
ident of the Standard Oil company of
New Jersey, and officer or director In
various other Industries, died at his

Van Buren and Mrs. Armer Saunder

Famous Standard Oil Figure.
John D. Archbold was almost as
closely identified with the history of
the Standard Oil as John D. Rocke
feller himself. Of the first nine trus
tees of the "trust" formed in 1S82 he
alone remained in this capacity until
its dissolution in 1911 at the order of
the United States supreme court, and
it was he who was named to engi
neer the dissolution, after which he
'became president and director of the
Standard Oil company of New Jersey.
He was the most active and aggres
sive fighter In the oil combine, and in
variably represented the Standard Oil
on the witness stand in the numerous
hearings in connection with the gov
ernment's suit to dissolve it.
This publicity was still further
heightened by the publication of a
score or more of letters from Mr.
Archbold to Joseph B. Foraker, then
Senator from Ohio, Representative
Joseph C. Sibley, of Pennsylvania and
other statesmen showing that large'
sums of money had been distributed
for the alleged purpose of influence,

as may be judged necessary and ex

confine myself to those matters of
more general public policy with
which it seems necessary and feasible
to deal at the present session of tM
congress.
I realise the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act
at this session and shall make my
suggestions as few as possible but
there were some things left undone
at the last session which there will
now be time to complete and which
it seems necessary in the interest of
the public to do at once.
In the first place, It seems to me
imperatively necessary that the ear

New York, Dec. 5.—In a Christmas
message to one hundred churches and

Churches of Christ in America points
out that "the Christmas sun this year
shines only upon our half of the
world" and the council "persuasively

Christmas a sacrament of self-denial.
It recommends that every Sunday
school should have a Christmas serv
ice in behalf of children across the

the children of Europe. It urges that
"at the family altar of every Christian
home, gifts be made equal in value
to those given in the family circle, for
some home in the near east or the far
east—a home for a home."
Each church, in appropriating ex
penditures for its own Sunday school
Christmas, is urged to set apart also
an equal gift for a school of children

mas dinner It is suggested that a gift
of equal value be made for the starv
