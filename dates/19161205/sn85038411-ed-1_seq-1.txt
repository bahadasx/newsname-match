SUFFRAGISTS HECKLE
HIM DURING SPEECH
Hold Demonstration in Gal
leries While President Is
Reading Address; He Gets
Great Ovation
Washington, Dec. 5. When Presi
dent Wilson appeared before Con
gress at 1 o'clock this afternoon to
deliver his annual address the Demo
crats and many Republicans united
in a great demonstration to felicitate
the President upon his re-election.
William Jennings Bryan and most
of the cabinet, occupying reserved
places on the floor, led in the demon
stration which was prolonged and
noisy. In the galleries Mrs. Wilson
and women of the cabinet Joined in
the hand clapping. In the diplomatic
galleries representatives of many of
the embassies and legations were In
terested spectators.
Galleries were packed when the
President, escorted by the usual com
mittee, walked briskly into the cham
ber and took his place at the clerk's
desk, manuscript in hand. He was
forced to wait while the demonstra
tion went on. Everybody rose while
the Democrats and some of the Re
publicans joined in cheers and ap
plause.
Wave after wave of shouts swept
the chamber until Speaker Clark
pounded for order.
The President smiled and bowed
and as the demonstration subsided,
began the reading of his address.
Refers First to Railroads
As he began reading a huge yellow
banner bearing in big black letters
the words, "Mr President, what will
you do for woman suffrage?" was un
furled over the edge of the gallery bv
some suffrage invaders.
A page quickly jumped up and pull
ed down the banner. The President
referred at the outset to his program
of railroad legislation. Senators and
representatives listened attentively
but without demonstration as he re
ferred to compulsory arbitration and
enlargement of the Interstate Com
merce Commission.
Persons in the far galleries, com
manding a view of the President, say
he looked up and smiled as the suff
rage banner fell to the floor. He con
tinued his reading without hesitation.
A policeman went to the gallery
from which the banner dropped and
stood near the suffragists. He made
no attempt to reach them.
About simultaneous with the un
furling of the banners, a long state
ment regarding the incident was given
out by the Congressional Union. It
said that officials of the union de
cided upon that method of calling the
President's attention to suffrage be
cause they understood he had omitted
reference to the issue in his address.
The banner was smuggled into the gal
lery in a handbag. Mrs. Abbey Scott
Baker, of the Congressional Union, ex
plained the incident as "expressive of
the Indignation that women feel at
the stupid and senseless opposition to
granting the right of self-government
to one-half the people of the United
States."
As the President proceeded with
recommendations for other legislation,
the listening Congress remained silent.
When the President concluded, how
ever, applause was renewed. The
suffragists who had dropped the ban
ner joined in it The President fin
ished speaking at 1.18.

Will Decide Y Wax
Is Long-Sought Oliver
Osborne Wanted in Suit
New York, Dec. s.—When Charles
H. Wax arrives late this afternoon
from Chicago he will confront a num
ber of persons who will decide
whether ho really is the long-sought
"Oliver Osborne" wanted here to clear
up a $250,000 breach of promise suit
against James W. Osborne, a promi
nent attorney. James W. Osborne de
clares that Rae Tanzer, who brings
the suit thought she wins being courted
by him when in reality she was re
ceiving attentions from Wax, and
Wax's confession to the Federal au
thorities supports this contention.
According to United States District
Attorney Marshall, the government
will make an immediate. Investigation
to prove the truth or falsity of every
statement Wax has made. When
shown a photograph of the self-con
fessed "Oliver," Rose Tanzer, a sister
of Rae Tanzer, said the picture was
not the "Oliver Osborne" she knew.
If Wax is accepted as the original
"Oliver" he will be used as a witness
in the criminal cases growing out of
the breach of promise action brought
by Miss Tanzer. Mr. Marshall said
that the prisoner will be looked over
also by women who accuse him of
swindling them.

Better Traffic Regulations
Demanded Throughout City
There Is a very general demand
throughout the city for better traffic
regulations and most people are won
dering why the plan to make certain
sections of the congested business
highways one-way streets is not put
into effect. Dally the congestion In
Fourth and Third streets becomes
more serious and It is apparent that
something will have to be done.
Mayor Meals has had this matter
under consideration, but no regulations
have been put into force. Parking of
automobiles on any of the business
streets will be strenuously opposed by
merchants and others and the stopping
of cars for more than a reasonable
time in the shopping district will also
meet with opposition.

STANDARD OIL
MAGNATE DIES
John D. Archbold Is Dead Af
ter Brief Illness; Reputed
Worth $100,000,000
Tarrytown, N. Y„ Dec. 5.—A noted
figure in the world's petroleum in
dustry was removed to-day when John
Dustin Archbold. capitalist, president
of tho Standard Oil Company of New
Jersey and officer or director in vari
ous other enterprises, died at his home
here after a two weeks' illness subse
quent to an operation for appendicitis.
Death came at 4 o'clock this morning.
For some hours the patient had been
unable to receive proper nourishment
and members of his family recognized
last night that the end was near.
Funeral services will be held here
Thursday forenoon, attended by rela
tives and many of his personal and
business friends, including John D.
Rockefeller and William Rockefeller
and their families. While these serv
ices are taking place Tarrytown's vari
ous Industries will suspend operations
as a memorial to Mr. Archbold's
democracy in the village of his resi
dence.
Mr. Archbold is survived by his
widow, a son, John F. Archbold, of
Thomasville, Ga., and a daughter, Mrs.
Michael Van Buren, of Newport, R. 1.,
and Mrs. Armar D. Saunderson, of

Started In Pennsylvania
Mr. Archbold was a native of Ohio
and was 8 years old. In early life he
was an oil refiner and buyer in West
ern Pennsylvania and in 1875 he be
came associated with the Rockefeller
interests, a connection that continued
until his death. He became president
of the Standard Oil Company of New
Jersey shortly after the dissolution of
the "trust" was ordered by the United
Stales Supreme Court.
Mr. Archbold's death followed an
illness of less than two weeks. He
was operated upon for appendicitis
November 23 and for a time seemed
to rally. Later he suffered a relapse
and the five physicians attending him
decided that blood transfusion must he
resorted to. Mr. Archbold's chauffeur

MILK THEFTS ON

Dealers Complain in Vain to
Police Department About
Sneak Thievery
DAIRYMEN LOSE MONEY
Harvey A. Rittcr and C. E.
Cooper Among Victims of
Police Inefficiency
All because of the inefficiency of
the police department, 110 longer will
the folk on Allison Hill get nice, fresh
milk for the morning oatmeal.
Milkmen throughout the district are
planning to make their deliveries in
the afternoon instead of the small
hours of the morning because of the
continued theft of milk.
The matter has been called to the
attention of the police department
repeatedly, but the thefts continue
and a number of dealers have an
nounced they will begin afternoon de
liveries at once.
The initiative was taken by Harvey
A. liitter. He started to-day to serve
his customers in the afternoon instead
of during the early morning hours.
Mr. Ritter said:
"It is the only thing to do. On
Sunday I lost five quart bottles and
seven pints. I have been a heavy
loser during the past month. The
milk bottles are stolen soon after they
are delivered, and we must stand the
loss. At least until the winter season
is over and the days are longer it will
be safer to make afternoon deliveries
when the people are around." The
police do not seem to be making any
effort to locate the thieves."
C. E. Cooper,'9ol South Twentieth
street, lost live gallons of milk last
Sunday and lie, too, will arrange for
afternoon deliveries. This plan is im
possible with some dealers for the
present, because the milk comes to
them from the farms late in the even
ing, or early the next morning. How
ever, according to Mr. Ritter, indica
tions are that the majority will be
making afternoon deliveries unless the
thefts cease.

SEALING FATE OF ,
CAPITAL, TEUTONS
ADVANCE NEARER
Bucharest Doomed as Ruman*
ian Armies Fall Before
Invaders /
CLOSING ON ALL SIDES
Another German Army Moving
on Rumanian Line of
Retreat /
The fate of Bucharest apparently IS
sealed. The Teutonic advance toward
It Is going on unchecked, Rumanian
attempts to stop it having been un
successful. This announcement is
made in the Kusslan official statement
to-day.
Petrograd also mentions Ploescl,
thirty-five miles north of Bucharest,
as another point in the direction of
which the invading armies are moving
without effective 'opposition. Ploescl
is on the line of the only railroad route
of retreat for the Rumanians operating
in the vicinty of Bucharest.
Means Evacuation
The threat to Ploescl seemingly
means the speedy evacuation of Bucha
rest if the Rumanians hope to make
an effective retreat over the railroad
line toward Moldavia. On the south
of the capital Kield Marshal von Mack
ensen's Danube army was reported
yesterday within twelve miles of the
city. The Rumanian first army oppos
ing the Teutonic advance from the
west is declared by Berlin to have been
decisively defeated on the Argechu.
From the northwest the Austro-Ger
man armies pushing from the moun
tain passes are aiding materially in
the effort to complete the enveloping
process and break through to the
Rumanian line of retreat.
Serbs Follow Up Victory
On the Macedonian front the Ser
bans are following ua their victory in
the Grunislite region and have cap
tured the village of Stravina, three
miles north of Grunishte, according
to a Serbian official statement. The
Bulgarians are reported retreating
northward, apparently having evacu
ated and set on fire the village ot
Zovik, two miles northwest of Stravina.
The French and Serbians are an
