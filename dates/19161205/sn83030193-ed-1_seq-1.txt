UP FIGHT ON HIGH

Directs Departments of Com

Ily Samuel M.Williams 1
(Sptclal Staff Correspondent of Tha
Evening World.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. President ,
Wilson has assumed direction of gov- j
ornmcntnl activities to roduco tho
hlgn cost of living. Ho has ordered
the Department of Justlco nnd of ,
Commerco to confer with him at onco
and submit reports on their ponding '
Investigations. I
Ho Is not yet ready to mako any
announcement on tho subject. Ho 1
will defer that until he has formulated
a dcllnlto plan of action. Tho prob-1
lem will then tin denlt with either In
a separate messngo or by tho formu
lation and Introduction of Adminis
tration hilts In Congress.
Tho President Is understood to bo
definitely opposed to any embargo
proposition.
"If Government Is to bo worth nny
thlng to tho people, It will hnvo to do
something on this food situation nnd
high cost of living besides talk and In
vestigate," said Ilepresentutlvo John
J. Fitzgerald of Hrooklyn to Tho live
ning World to-day, discussing his
embargo and othor relief bills.
"Some men aro saying that an em
bargo Is a very unneutral act and a
pro-Gcrmnu proposition. That Is all
poppycock. When a nation's food
supply begins to run short, elf
preservation tnkea prcccdcnco of
every other consideration.
"To thosu who protest against em
bargo let mo call attention to the sit
uation In Iloston. Mayor Curley of
that city got on tho trail of food price
boosters and discovered that while
retail merchants wero complaining
that they could not obtain sutllclent
supply of mcnt from packers and
wholesalers, thero wero thousands of
pounds of beef In cold storage wait
ing shipment abroad, which was
withheld from home demand.
"Hut 1 venture this prediction, that
wlthlp a very short tlmo the outcry
of tho country against shortage of
food supply and extortion In prices
will compel decisive action of some
kind by thn Government to protect
our people, l want relief. If an em
bargo Is rejected, then show mo
something that will be as rffoctlvu,"
WILSON TO LOOK INTO
CAR STRIKE SITUATION
Mayor Tells Leaders President Was
Deeply Interested at Satur
day's Conference.
William II. Fitzgerald, strike leader,
and I.ouls r'rldlger, couusnl for thn
striking carmen, asked .Mayor
Mltchel to. day for tho result of thn
talk thu .Mayor had with President
Wilson Saturday night on tho strlko
situation.
The .Mayor told his callers ho had
related the wind" story of tho car
men's troubles to tho President and
found him deeply Interestod, but that
no conclusion was reached because
.Mr. Wilson wanted to ascertain what
power, If any, he possesses to deal
with tho matter.

Georges Carpcntlcr, heavyweight
champion of France, nnd Jess Wll

matched for n ten-round no decision

tho next two months. Whllo the
final signatures of tho pugilists have
not been secured, tho verbal consent
of both heavyweights has been ob
tained nnd they aro now waiting for
tho nrtlcles of agreement to bo for
warded to them.
Tex lllcknrd, who has gained pugi
listic fame ns tho promoter of the
Johnson-Jeffries, Kelson-Cans nnd
Wlllnrd-Mnran bouts, with their record
purses, failed In nil his early attempts
to bring, tho French nnd American
chnmplnns together. It was not until
he enlisted tho aid of members of one
of tho French relief fund committees
that tho contest was mado possible.
Pressure was brought to bear upon
tho proper high officials In Franco nnd
their consent obtnlned for Carpentlcr
to leave tho army and the country for
a period of some three months.
In order to secure this unusual con
cession It was necessary for Hlckard to
ngreo to give this fund tho sum of
JtO.OOO, In addition to paying Carpen
tier's travelling and trnlning expenses,
for the bout with Wlllard.
Tho prlvato arrangements between
the itellef Fund Committee and the
French pugilist aro not known to the
promoters, but It Is understood that
Carpcntlcr has offered to box for his
expenses and has stipulated that any
profits that may aecruu to him shall
bo applied to tho general uses of the
fund In thn snmu manner as any other
contribution.
Cnrpentlcr hns not engnued In a

FOR STRICT SCRUTINY.
Accused to Be Spirited Into

Within twenty-four hours after tho
arrest of Chnrlea H. Wax In Chicago
nnd his confession to tho Federal au
thorities that ho and not James W.
Osborne, tho attorney, Is "Oliver Os
borne," dcspollcr of tho heart of Itac
Tnnzer, who sued tho lawyer for
breach of promise and was In turn
indicted with her attorneys nnd other?
In tho perjury proceedings which fol
lowed, enmo to-day a rush of denials
that tho Chicago prisoner Is the man
ho represents himself to he.
Tho mystery which hns plagued Os
borne, tho lawyer, for two years
seems about to be Intensified rather
thnn cleared.
Ilcnjamln Slade, of tho firm of
brothers who brought Miss Tanzer's
suit, turned looso a vitriolic attack
on James W. Osborne, after comment
ing on tho acknowledgment that tho
$1,000 reward offered for tho arrest of
"Oliver"' was furnished to tho Jjv
ernmcnt by Lawyer Osborne. Mr.
Slado said;
"All the, powors that bo may be
brought to bear to provo that tho mun
they nro bringing hero Is 'Oliver Os
borne.' Hut wo aro certain that Jus
tlco will prevail and tho fraud shown
up. I shall bo very glad If tho al
leged 'Oliver Osborno' Is confronted
with tho evidence already given In
tho various trials.
"It will bo conclusively shown that
tho discovery of this alleged 'Oliver
Osborno' Is tho Inst link In tho organ
ized attempt to divert suspicion from
tho real person who Is, always has
been nnd will remain OLIVKIl OS
HOHNU." GOVERNMENT NOT DISTURBED,
SAYS PROSECUTOR.
Assistant United States District At

ment was not disturbed hy tho slight
est doubt as to the truthfulness of
tho confession of Wax, tho latest of
whoso string of assumed names used
In nefarious philandering was discov.

Wood said:
"Wo forwarded to Chicago samples
of his handwriting taken from hotel
registers nnd letters found In baggage
cbandoned by 'Oliver Osborne.' Thost
have been verified thero as Identical
with the writing of Wax. Moreover,
Post OIllco Inspector Swalu has tele

Tho rvstlltH of Lloyd George's resig

hoped hero this arteruoon that the
situation might 'lie so icadjusted that
tho Welshman's Invaluable services
might be retained In tho Govern
ment's service.
In sumo qun'rte.rs it was predicted
ho would devoto his energies In the
near future to addressing a series of

for tho purpose of Impressing upon hU
countrymen tho vital realities of thu

Tho Westminster Gazette says
Premier Asqulth declined definitely a
proposal for tho formation of a Wur
Council of which ho would not be a
member and other consequential
changes which would have followed
acceptance of that proposal,
Mr, Asqulth approved a unaller
War Council, but held tho Premier
necessarily must be Chairman of any
such body. His attitude Is said to be
supportod by Foreign Secretary Grey

In tho Cabinet.
There was no confirmation of a

It was believed he would do so rather
