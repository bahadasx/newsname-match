OPENING
WEED SALES
Probably 100,000 Pounds Will
iBe 'Offered On Various
Loose Floors.
The rain yesterday was encourag
ing to the tobacco men and with
enough of it lo make a season there
will be some lively movements in
marketing the crop that is bringing
such satisfactory prices.
Many crops are being sold at prices
as high as $12 in one instance reported.
A man named Shanklin in Todd coun
ty sold his crop at that figu to the
Kentucky Leaf & Transit Co. Other
sales have been made at $10, $11 and
$11.50.
The loose floors wero to open busi
ness today but there will be small
Lsales if any, owing to the recent un
favorable weather. One of the ware
houses has 50,000 or 60,000 pounds
on its floors and the others have
smaller amounts. Probably 100,000
pouifts or more will be sold.

PHOTOGRAPH PRODUCED
Of Woman of The Same
Name Taken About Five
Years Ago.
Kathcrine Denton, tho woman who
died at the Jennie Stuart Hospital last
Thursday, will be buried to-day.
W. R. Crawley and others took up a
popular collection yesterday and
raised enough money to buy a decent
coffin and one of the classes in the
Baptist Sunday School bought a robe.
The woman left $7.75 in the hands of
J. L. Freedman, but there is a hos
pital bill to be paid by some one.
County Judge Knight authorized this
and the woman's money may be
applied to some portion of the ex
penses incurred.
The only new development is that
a man who did not want his name
used appeared at the Waller & Trice
establishment, where the body was
held, and showed the picture ot a
woman given to him by a woman
calling herself Kathcrine Denton five
years ago. She was at that time a
woman of loose morals. An inspec
tion of the photograph seemed to fix
the identity of the victim as the 'tome
woman. At least the resemblance
was striking.
No one has claimed to know the
women in any of the cities she
rpfnrrpfl.to anil the onininn is now
generaOhat the poor vtetimMtoldUhe
truth when she said she had no
friends and refused to give her home
address, if she had one.
Lieut. Hawkins, of the police force,
worked on all clues that were found
and finally established the fact
that the women went to Cerulean
by rail and came back in a
livery rig of Frank Smith, of Ceru
lean, to this city. She went to the
Hill House and then went out the
Princeton road to the house where
she was fatally burned the same
night. That afternoon Smith passed
her on the road as he returned to Ce
rulean and spoke to her about a letter
he had lost oh the trip to Hopkinsvillc
This was told by a little girl name
Ricketts who was riding a short dis
tance from school with Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith admitted these facts but
i said he knew nothing about the wo
man, except that she said her name
was Denton.

Nice Quiet Place.
The announcement that the post of
fice proposes to dispatch a mail to
Tristan d'Acunha has caused a con
siderable interest, for it is ten years
since a mail was sent from this coun
try. The island lies midway between
South America and the Cape of Good
Hope, and ten years ago the popula-1 saying he had committed himself to

A Conscientious Juror.
In an Ohio court a juror was about
to be sworn in, when the judge be
thought himself to say:
"I trust, sir, that you fully under
stand the duties and responsibilities
of a juror?"
ThereujHMi the men drew himself
up and said:
"Your Honor, I am a plain man,
andbelicvo in being fair to all. I
don't go by what the lawyers say,
nnd I don't go by what the judge
says, bul I look carefully at the de
fendant in the dock, and I say to my
self, 'that fellow must have done
something, or he wouldn't be here.'
So I bring 'em all in guilty!"

JTUIISH CITY
RUSSIA'S PRIZE
Asserted in Duma That All
the Allies Had Agreed to
This Disposition.
TREATY WAS MADE IN 1915
Bucharest May Be Captured
But Army of the Nation
May Get Away Safely.
London, Dec. 4. An event surpass
ing in far renching importance the
actual military operations of tho war
comes today in the public announce
ment by the new Russian premier,
Alexander Trepoff, that by an agree
ment concluded in 1915 and subse
quently adhered to by Italy, the al'
definitely established Russian ri
to Constantinople and the straits.
existence of this agreoment has h
for a long time alleged, but never Wv
fore was it thus publicly and formally
admitted.
Simultaneously, while the fate of
Bucharest is still hanging in the bal
ance, conies the news that Russia,
which has been accused in some
quarters of failing to renderassistttnee
to its sorely pressed ally, is making
heroic efforts to turn the tide of
events in Rumania and in addition to
oxorting vigorous pressure against
von Falkenhayn in Moldavia, where
the Russians have gained a footing at
Kirlibaba and the battle is continuing
wiUuutmost energy.
Tnnw Russian effort is visible
on the Danube, south of Bucharest
where newlv arrived Russian troons
m Deen ,aKen a,m tne Germans and
Bulgarians having been driven from
Tzohana and Gostinari. The Russians
ate also successfully applying pres
sure in Dobrudja.
These Russian attacks on the two
extreme flanks of the central forces
although they may be too late to save
Bucharest, may, if successfully pro
secuted change the complexion of the
Rumanian campaign, as there is no
indication as yet that the enveloping
movement of the central powers has
succeeded in cutting off and consid
erable portion of the Rumanian
armies.
In connection with the fate of Buch-
arest, a semi-official Rumanian state
ment has been received by wireless
to the effect that before the com
mencement of the war, Bucharest
was deprived of the character of sl
fortress and that when the dange
occupation presented itself steps
taken for the evacuation of the cit ;
the military elements, but not bj j
civilian population who had beci
joined to remain in the city.
This points to the military abai.flon
mentofthc city and would stcin'tu
indicate that the Russians are fighting
engagements to delay their enemy and
secure the safe retirement of ;'. it
, armies.
