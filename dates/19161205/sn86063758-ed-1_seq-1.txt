Hunter's Paradise.
in nnnnanv with Mr. Joe W. EDting
ive arived at Georgetown, S. C., Mon
day 20th, at 10 a. m.; was met by
VIr. F. T. Johnstone, aboard his swift
[aunch; down Winyah Bay 12 miles to
Estherville plantation, for a deer,
Suck and wild turkey shooting.. At
I p. m. after a sumptuous dinner up
>n arrival at the fine hunting preserve
of Mr. F. E. .Tolmstone. containing
some 30,000 acres, with him and his
guide, Mr. Williams, the 12 well j
trained dogs released from their ken-j
nel and in less than 10 minutes a fine
leer came bounding by my compan
ion, Mr. Epting. He fired a shot with
out felling this monster; otb?r deer
routed before sun closed the hour of
.lie uav.
We repaired to the hospitable horn?
af Mr. .Johnstone, where Mrs. and
Miss iy'nabel Johnstone greeted us,
who gave us a dinner rarely sup
plied by the queen of England. No
need to tell your readers of how I i
enjoyed the cooter soup, oysters, j
roast duck, venison haunch, cran
berry sauce, etc, etc.
Day by day for a week we hunted
ir>er, ducks and wild turkey, jump
ing not less than 7 to 10 deer and more
a day, ducks by the thousands.
Mr. Epting soon killed a fine fat
Jeer, then I followed and killed a
n lovnrnv floor thpn ATl* P!n_
- vUiUC *> uai iaig,T i VAV^'O* , . ?
ting killed a large wild turkey and
[ might continue telling you of our
sport but I must be brief.
It is wonderful to me liow Mr.
Johnstone can furnish a comfortable
home, b?st of meals, horses, (logs,
guides, etc., allowing hunters to keep
all the game they kill. It is neces
sary to procure a date as this fam
ous preserve is crowded the entire
season with sportsmen from Ohio,
Pennsylvania. Wyoming and many
other States. I was told a date has'
been secured for Henry Ford. We!
caught an o'possum in sight of our |
hunting lodge with a setter dog.
After a week of royal sport I am ;
again ai nome uawng kuiucu o j
pounds in weight, aid trust life may
be spared to again "hunt at the F. E.
