LONDON. Ecg, IHc 5The

that war secretary David Lloyd
George has decided to resign.

premier Asqulth, hinted at from Lon
don, Indicates a split which may wreck
the British cabinet, as now constitut
ed and result in the creation of a new
ministry.
Previously, it was announced that
the premier and the secretary of state
for war had held a conference at which
it was believed that an agreement had
been reached and that both would re
main in the cabinet.
The recognition of the government,
so far as Its plans have been made
known, contemplates the creation of a
small war council for a more vigorous
prosecution of the war. The fact tha.
members of the cabinet have taken
sides with either the premier or the
secretary of state for war is regarded
with apprehension.
HOLLAND HAS PROTESTED
AGAINST DEPORTING BELGIANS
London. Eng.. Dec .". According to
a Reuter's Telegram company dispatch
from The Hague, the foreign minister
of Holland has sent to Gcrmanv a pro
test azainst the deportation of the Bel
gians as being opposed to the provi
sions of The Hague convention.
Holland's action, it is explained, was
due to the fact that many Belgian
refugees who originally took refuge in
Holland, later returned to Belgium
after having received guaranties from
the highest German officials, with the
cooperation of Holland, that they would
net be transported to Germany.
Holland, therefore, has expressed the
expectation that deported persons who
came within the meaning of these
guaranties would be returned.

Berlin. Germany. Dec 5. Replying

notes, except the Inquiry concerning
the former American-Hawaiian Steam
ship company's steamer Columbian,
