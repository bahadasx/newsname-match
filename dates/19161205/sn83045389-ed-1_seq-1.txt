I ntrodueed at last night's meeting of
the Common Council by Councilman

Richmond no enviable praise Tn*

Ifaddon's idea is that the appropria

I'nder a suspension of the rules the
Council adopt ed a resolution, intro.

stricts the Committee on Advert Ising

Me. Koden announced at the last;

that he intended to offer such a reso- i

committee from time to time hatl

Possibility that President Wilson

thought probable that the President
would select a separate occasion for
it, rather than to add it as a supple
ment to his sonera I address to-morrow.
Klf-vn hills and resolutions seeking
ft. chock the soaring prices of food by
stopping shipments to Kurope, reducing
parcel post rates on foodstuffs or con
trolling cold storage. were to-day in
troduced in the House.
President Goinpers and a committee
of the American Federation of Labor
called on President Wilson and asked
hint to appoint a special commission
to investigate the food question. The
President assured th?m that the gov
ernment would take some steps to
meet the situation. He is understood
to prefer not to appoint a commission,
as it practically would bo without au
thority t<? compel testimony: while a.
congressional investigation probably
would mean a protracted delay.

AS FAST AS I Ol.i.KCTi:!)
Reports being gathered by the De
partment of Agriculture are being laid
before the President as fast as they
a ompiled. and upon them he is e\
peeled lo decide on any action, which
undoubtedly will be prefaced by a
special address to Congress.
One report submitted to-day by
Secretary RedfU-ld. and held conltden
tial as yet. is understood to shovy a
wide margin between prices paid to
producers and those paid by consumers.
In a recent address, the President vir
tually charged the- middlemen with re
sponsibility for the high cost of living.
The bills in Congress are expected
to produce a general discussion of the
subject, but none of the administration
leaders tlilnk.s any of the embargo
measures can pass. A series of four,
introduced by Chairman Fitzgerald. of
the Appropriations Committee, proposes
embargo, reduction of parcel post rates
and restriction of cold storage.
Representative McLemore. of Texas,
introduced a resolution to prohibit in
terstate transportation of food prod
ucts. except meats and fruits, that
have been kept in cold storage more
than ninety days. One by Represen
tative Kabath, of Illinois, would re.
quire cold-storage warehouse? to lile
annual reports with the Department of
Agriculture for publication on July 1.
showing- food products stored for in
terstate commerce. Another would di
rect the Attorney-General to investi
gate the causes of unreasonable ad
vances in prices of foodstuffs, cotton
uoods or fabrics, wood pulp, all kinds
of paper and coal, in so far as they
ar< claimed to be affected by any com
bination or conspiracy, and to report

has the immigration bill, the cor

proposed abolition of the Christmas'
holidays, and a compromise holiday of
one week has been suggested.
Although food - embargo proposals
are certain to create much discussion,
few leaders are inclined to believe

with Bukharcst their main objective,
have joined hands from the Danube in
the south tu the northwest of Bukha
rest. where, coming through the moun
tainous region. they have readied the
town or Tergovistea. Berlin announces
that the battle <>f the Argeehu lliver
has come to a final conclusion with
the teutonic allies the victors, and that
all along the front they are drawing
? closer to Bukharest.
With the capture of Tergovistea. anrl
farther south, the driving of the Rou

I powers now hold intact all the rail
way tinea running Into Bukharest from

ning north from the capital into Tran
sylvania, is the sole remaining railway
connection In Western Wallauhla part
ly in Roumanian hands, and with the
Teutons now nearly astride this .lino
at Breza and rapidly advancing, this
route seems likely to he taken from
them.
To the south and southwest of Buk
liarest. the forces of Field Marshal von
'? Mackenseu that crossed the Danube
, have inflicted a lo-avy defeat on the
I Roumanians, and captured the town of
j Gradichtea, twelve miles from the cap!

In this lighting, according to Berlin,
the Roumanian army suffered sangul
j nary casualties, and on Sunday lost
. more than S.rtOn men made prisoner and

British sappers near Ypres and

sions paved the way for a raid on Cer
tnan trenches. Some of the British
succeeded in entering an advanced
trench, but later were driven out. A
British attempt against |,e Sars also
failed. Considerable artillery activity
continues at various points along the
I' rench front, especially in the Soinnie
region and on the Verdun sector.
Artillery duels and small maneuvers
by patrol parties have featured the
lighting on the Austro-Italian front.
