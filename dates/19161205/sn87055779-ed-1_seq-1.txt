No Talk of Peace is Heard in
London Lloyd-George
Scores Victory.
International News Scrvi.e:
LONDON. Dec. .". pacitits who
had hoped that a change of govern
ment might lead to a consideration
of peace proposals see no promise
in the present outlook today.
Premier Asjuith's declaration in
the house of commons hat there
would be no departure from the
policy pursued from the beginning
of the war was interpreted ' today as
meaning that a reconstruction of
the cabinet would result in a m re
vigorous prosecution of the war than
ever. Apparently there is to be no
thought of peace, no matter what
the personnel of the new cabinet
may be.
As the situation exists today War
Sec'y David Lloyd-George has won
a decisive victory. The possibility
still exists that Mr. Lloyd-George
may become premier, although
there is nothing to suggest at this
time that Mr. Asquith will resign.
The work of selecting the rnein
I'crs of the new coalition povern
ment is now under way and it Is
believed that the premier will be
able to announce the complete
make-up of the new government
when the house of commons con
venes on Thursday.
Seldom, if ever, has the air been
so heavily surcharged with political
rumors. There are persistent re
ports that A. .1. Balfour, lirst lord
of the admiralty; Vi.-count Grey, the
foreign secretary: Walter Runciman,
president of the hoard of trade, and
Reginald McKenna, chancellor of
the exoheotier. will not ho In tho

POLITICAL FIGHT
International News Serviee:
WASHINGTON. Dec. 5. Lines
were drawn here today for some of
the bitterest and most sensational
fighting of this session of congress,
when Sen. Owen of Oklahoma, dem
ocrat, completed a draft of a reso
lution to investigate expenditures of
the pa-ct campaign, and S'en. Boies
Penrose of Pennsylvania, republi
can, prepared to introduce his force
bill calculated to break up the dem
ocratic control of the solid south.
Sen. Owen planned to press for
immediate action on his investigat
ing resolution today. He wants to
get the proposed investipating com
mittee working while the big ex
penditures of the past campaign are
$-. t i 1 1 clear in the memory of the
country. The resolution will grant
immunity to witnesses so as to facil
itate the committee's work.
The resolution probably will au
thorize the investigation committee
to visit and take testimony In state
where corruption is most strongly
suspected.
Sen. Penrose will introduce bits
force bill as a rider to Sen. Owen's
corrupt practices bill, calculated to
limit campaign expenditures. The
proposed rider would provide for
federal supervision of national elec
tions and would remove obstacles
from the voting of republican Ne
