ORDERS RECEIVED TUES
DAY NIGHT AND GO
THURSDAY AT 7,30
TO BELEN
Yesterday morning at seven thirty
occurred the most stirring rene ever
witnessed at the Carlsbad depot
About thirty autos and at leait MM)
people went to tee Company "B"
leave for the Mexican border. Only
thlrtv-seven men left with the first
installment while Lieutenant Fred
West waa left to recruit ao aa to All
the romnany to it full complement
of sixty-five of which he eecured nine
yesterday. Many affecting; scenes
were witnessed as the boys departed.
Many mothers, wives, sisters and
sweethearts were with their loved
ones until the last minuto and from
the tearful parting one might be
led to almost believe the boys were
going to a real war Instead of guards
for the border and with but as small
a chance for casualty as at their var
ious occupations at home. However,
the men that departed yesterday
would bo as apt to go if the war waa
as fierce as that in France at present
And. those are the boya who, by
sacrificing all their hopes and plea
sures at home can be depended upon
to protect the country should such a
thins; ao invasion by a hostile fores
over occur.
The following from the versatile
Will Robinson in the News of Koswell
tells the story of how the battery peo
ple departed:
It was 10:25 when the bugle sounded
the assembly, and the boys planted the
last kiss on some dear mother's Hps,
or gave the last hue to some little
tot a son or daughter, or held in em
brace a wife, or clasped the hand of a
sweetheart. It was the last of the
formalties, the call was for duty, and
as they rushed for the train stream
ins; oyes were in evidence, suppressed
sobs were heard on all sides, and aa
the train rolled out of sight it was a
quiet crowd that left the station, for
the real seriousnoss of war was ap
preciated. The 17 men and boys eomorlsing
Battery A came from every walk of
life in the city. There is hardly a
business institution but what is ef
fected, and there are but few homes
but what have felt the drain, either
by reason of relationship or bonds of
friendship. The succet of Battery A
will be followed with keen interest
and possibly utini mother will never
again see the real joy of her declining
life again. The slope of South I'ark
cemetery may be decorated with now
f craves from the ranks of the boys who
eft this morning.
There were many canes of patriotism
demonstrated. Husbands left young
wives, others left small Infants, and
in some cases it may be a question of
(retting by, but it demonstrates the
spirit that has ever dominated this
land, that when the country is in dan
ger that all will sacrifice for its pro
tection. The minute-boy of '76 gave
all, and so on down the line and
when the great rebellion was on,
whether from the north or the south,
all wanted to go; boys of 14 fibbed
to vet to go, and it waa no uncommon
Ight to seo a lad of 16 alongside of
a veteran of 60. So it ia today, all
wanted to go, and when the order
oame for recruits to make ui the full
complement, there was a response
that showed patriotism as pronounced
today aa it was in the beginning of
our greet democratic republic.
There are many homes today that
re sad, but there are no homes but
what are proud of the imva who went
It is a sacrifice on the part of manv
of the mothers to see her only boy g
to the front but it must be a glorifica
tion for her to know that he Is made
of the stuff that has made American
ism regarded the world over. The
wife who said "Go and return to us
when the war Is over." showed that
she had the spirit of the wives of
'78, who made bandages and supplies
for the boys of the revolutionary war.
It Is the same spirit only at a differ
ent age.
What will be the termination of the
war cannot be forecasted, but it is the
hope of all that the boys will not have
to go outside of ta atetes, but will be
held on the border for patrol duty;
but if the situation should become
more complex, and the call Issued for
volunteers, the militia will then op
tionally be enlisted into the regular
army, and judging by the spirit of
Battery A every one that can pass the
examination will enroll.

HEAVY TROOP MOVEMENT
INDICATES RESOLUTION TO
DEAL FIRMLY WITH MEXICO.
National Guardsmen of Texas, New
Mexico, and Ariona Ordered Out to
Reinforce Regular Army and May
Be Sent to Join Pershing in Mexico.
Cabinet Officers Pessimistic Over Ob
rrgon's Failure to Ratify Agree
ment With General Scott Though
Hope Peraiala That Protocol May
Be Signed.
Washington, May 9. With 8,000 ad
ditional troops under orders for the
Moxicsn border, including 4,000 na
tional guardsmen from Arixona, New
Mexico and Texas, administration ofll
cials felt tonight that necessary steps
had been taken to prevent further
raiding of American border towns by
Mexican bandits.
President Wilton and his cabinet
discussed tha Mexican situation to
day but the president had authorised
tho new troops orders before his ad
visers got there. General Scott and
General Funston recommended early
in tho day that additional force! be
sent to the border. After an exchange
of telegrams General Funston sug
gested that the national guard from
tne throe states namsd be called out,
in addition to tho sending of all the
remaining regular infantry to Join
his command. His suggestion was
promptly approved and orders dis
patched. Some members of the cabinet were
frankly pessimistic after the meeting
over the delay of General Obregon in
ratifying tho agreement he nag dated
with General Soott covering co-operative
border operations including those
of General Pershing's expedition. Re
porte from Mexico City indicated that
tho agreement has been approved by
General Carranca and officials here
were at a loss to understand Obro
gon's action.
The majority of tho president's
advisers believed the agreement final
ly would bo ratified and that the bor
der situation would clear itself quick
ly thereafter. It was clearly inti
mated that there would be no change
in tne policy of tho Washington gov
ernment; that the troops would stay
in Mexico until tho border waa safe
from incursions; thst raiders would
be pursued across tha line every time
they Decerns active and that the
whole strength of the national guard
would be used if necessary.
Secretary Baker said tha Question
of calling guardsmen from other sta
tes Into the service was not under
immediate consideration. It was
learned, however, that General Fun
ston already had been supplied with
all papers, forms and instructions nec
essary to muster into service ' the
guardsmen of all states near tho bor
der, and that ordnance and quarter
master stores to outfit all such troops
on a full war basis are held at con
venient points for quick distribu
tion. Mr. Baker refused to discuss re
ports that General Funston had urg
ed that he be given a total of 150,0 K)
men to maintain the border guaru.
It is possible that the border comman
der mentioned, the number of men
he wanted to insure protection to bor
der towns and ranches by providing
an adequate guard for each. The
secretary said General Pershing's
force in Mexico was able to lake care
of itself in any emergency.
Including the troops ordered out
today there will be nearly 45,000 sol
diers perhaps 50,000, along the border
and in Mexico, according to the best
available figures here. The war de
partment has declined to publish ac
tual numbers, but with the ntire mo
bile army, except five troops of cav
alry under General Ponaton'a com
mand, in addition to the 4.000 or
more guardsmen and the several
thousand recruits who are being for
warded to the regular regiments as
fast as they are mustered in the
United States has a cnnsiderabW armv
strung out along 1.H00 miles of the
international line.
Calling out the national guard for
the first time under the present mili
tary law brings up the fact that as
written, the act authorises the presi
dent to use the state soldiers either
within or without United States terri
tory. The provision authorizes the
use of the guardsmen as such beyond
the border wss held to be unconstitu
tional by former Attorney General
Wirkersham. It never has been pass
ed on by the supreme court, however,
and President Wilson has full legal
authority to employ the state forces
bérond the border if he so desires.
Only an injunction against the war
department eould prevent it
By the terms of the law the guards
men must be mustered into the service
of the United States before they
come under complete control of the
federal government Their oaths of
enlistment to tho various states makes
the acceptance of this federal status
obligatory, however, and there Is no
question of volunteering involved in
the present system. Tho full enrolled
strength of oaeh regiment called out
Is HablO for service under penalty of
court, or court martial action.
H. O. Smith, Roy E. Wilkinson, B, A.
Horton, Lawrence Clardy, R. Ohne
mus, Jr., Claude Williams.
Regimental Sergeant Major Dean
Smith.
Craddock Rule, Bryan Mudgett,
Clay Beckett.
Sergeant West is recruiting officer.
Tho names of tho nine recruits so
cured this week are as follows;
Jake Grubaugh, Harry Grubaugh,
L. C. Anderson, Jno. Roderick, L. L.
Watklns. J. O. Banco, Wm. Keener,
O. W. ladlburgh. Clay Beckett.
Army officers believe there will be
no difficulty in getting out the full
strength. They anticipate, instead,
a spurt of enlistment in the national
guard of the three states, because
of the chanco for active service.
The regiments are now at peace
strength. Under the interpretation
placed on the law, the states are re
quired to recruit them immediately
to full war strength and to send the
recruits forwsrd as fast as they ars
sworn in.
While in the federal service the
guardmen's only relation to the state
from which they came is that the gov
ernor retains the power to appoint
officers and that the state is reuired
to keep up the strength of the regi
ments against campaign wantage. The
fighting organization is loaned com
pleta to the government for such
time as it is needed.
President Wilson specified no time
of service in his call. The law auth
orises him to do so but does not make
it mandatory. The situstion on tho
border is such that no forces it of the
length of time they may be needed
can be made.

a switchman, was killed about 11
o'clock today in the railroad yards
at this place. There were no eye
witnesses to the occurrence, and the
manner In which Cooper met bis
dsath la left entirely to conjecture.
It la supposed that Cooper stepped
in behind a cut of cars for the pur-
Kse of making a coupling and that
failed to give the necessary signal
to tho engineer before doing so, and
that while ho was engaged in this
work a switch en ire with another
cut of cars backeJ down upon him
and threw him under the cars. The

In very feeble health and the sad news
coming as it did, made it very hard
for all the family to bear. The
casket containing the remains came
down from Albuquerque yesterday and
tha host of railroad men that have
known him brought lovely (lowers and
his casket was a bower of roses. He
enjoyed a good home and a fond
mother who idolizes her sons, and
whan at home he found fresh cut
flowers in his room when they were in

PRIMARY
BACCALAUREATE.
Sunday at the High School audi
torium, a splendid program was ar
ranged. The auditorium was welt
filled with manv interested friends
and proud parents. The stage was
tastefully arranged with cut roses,
blooming pot plants and ferns and an
unusually effective color tone of pink
and green. Grace Jones, Nettie Mae
Kinilel, Hattie Smith. era Iloyd, Mil
dred Pate, Ovl Kut-ter were daintily
dressed and lovely ushers. The Fresh
man class came first as musical notes
sounded and took their seats. The
Sophomore, Juniors and last the
stately Seniors eight in number,
three boys and five girls. A splen
did musical program was given.
Voluntary by Mrs. 1). Jackson and
Miss Penny. Solo by Mrs. Ralph, also
the duet by Meads mes J. D. Racklcy
and C. C. 1-ewis, in which the. two
voices rendered, "My Faith Looks Up
to Thee" perfectly.
The scripture reading, 11 Timothy
chapter 3, and a fervent prayer by
Rev. E. J. Barb.
Reading of the XIX Psalm by C. II.
Mclenatnen conveyed the same thnt
and helped Rev. J. T. Redmond in
many ways In presenting to this class
of 1916 Seniors "The Way of Living".
This was a master sermon in which
he spoke only to the class. To print
the sermon would hardly be fair, for
much force is in the delivery. The
one point he wished to emphasize was
"you can't live without influence" and
throughout the sermon the class waa
entreated to turn and read "The Way
of Living". He spoke of the times in
life when they would be subjected to
the strains of responsibility, that
life held many hard knocks, but in
starting right, one would have a big
advantage. Don't be afraid, if you
have the convictions you are right,
be fearless. There is only one way
to move, on and up.
VIEWS OF DEATH TRAP.
Views of the bridge where John R.
Joyce met desth have been made by a
friend a banker by the name of II.
II. Rurrough at Cheraw, South Caro
lina. They are very interesting and
prove beyond a doubt that the way
was treacherous. Six views were
made. The first showing the curve
before the bridge is reached and as
the auto is making this curve a large
hole is noticed about forty feet from
the - bridge and one naturally turns
to miss this hole and leaves the mid
dle of the road and in trying to gain
the high road again the wheels strike
sand on the rolling side or the road,
iust gaining the bridge. The ends of
the plank are uneven and one plank
had been sawed partly in two when
the wheel struck this plank the car
went over. The physician is sure Mr.
Joyce was driving fast, thinking he
was on a straight road and the sud
den stop threw him against the steer
ing wheel and crushed his lite out
before the car went over. To reali.e
the situation one only requires a look
at these views.
