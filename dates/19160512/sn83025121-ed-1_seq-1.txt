President Carranza Takes Up
Slogan of 'Mexico For, Mexi

United States Near Actual War
(Associated Preaa by Federal Wlrslsss.)
WASHINGTON, May 12 Fresh
border outrages, another raid
and the killing of a Texas ranch
er by Mexican outlaws, the breaking off
of the conferences between Generals
Scott and Funston and General Obre
gon, and the report that Carranza ia
playing politica with the aituutlon, ami
has been winning popularity and add
ed strength for himself and his do fat
to government by the slogs a MMexk
for the Mexicans," combined t alarm
the admiulstratioa here' last nlfht. .
It ia asserted in despatches frma'pl

that General Carrant has aeea htf

who is representing the de facto gov
ernment at tho conferences with tho ' !.
American generals at Juarex, Is stead- '
ily losing popnlaritjr because of his t :
agreeing to eertaia of the American
proposals.
Actual Break Seems Near
"Mexico for Mexicans," which is
the slogan of the Carranca parfv, is
spreading all over the republic' like ' ,
wildfire and is gaining adherents for w
Cnrrnnxa everywhere. The situation
consequently is becoming, more nnd
more strained, and government officials
admit that the possibility of an nrtual
break between the -countries is neirer
than it hns been for some time.
It has been definitely announced that
the conferences on the border have
been suspended. The conferees last
night issued a statement In Krhich they
declared that they have now renchel
a point wherethey believe it beat to
cease talking and refer the whole mat
ter to their respective governments and
allow the remainder of the negotiations
to be handled by the foreign offices.
The situation is exactly where it was
when the conferences started, the nr
levs having accomplished nothing. Tbo
Mexicans are still insisting upon an
early withdrawal of all American troo;
from Mexico, while General Scott and
General Funston, acting OB Instructions
from Washington, have flatly refused to
grant this demand.
New Outrages On Border
New outrages flared up in two plarea
along the border-yesterday. The tlrst
followed on the heels of the column of
cavalrymen under the command of Maj.
George T. Langhorne. Before the duat
of his horses' feet had settled down up
on Boquillaa a party of Mexican ban
dits crossed the Rio Grande, about four
miles north of the little iown, and be
gan attnrking civilians aad soldiers,
guarding the ore terminal, four miles
from Boquillus. Although surprised tho
Americans put up a game light and af
ter a smart skirmish the' baadlts fled
across to Mexican noil again.. - t
Near Brownsville, at the moath of
the Kio Grande, and closer Still to the
little border town of Mercedes, Texas,
s party of four or live robbers crossed
the river and attacked Curtis Bayleaa,
an American farmer, who was at work
in bis fields. They gave the map no
chance for his life, snooting him down
from cover. After robbing bio the
bund its tied and are believed to have es
caped ncruss the river into Mexico,
Big Posse Fails To Score
A purtv of cavalrymen, thirty strong,
and u posse of civilians were instantly
formed ami began the chase of the
murderers, but up to a lute hour last
night had not reported any success. It
is understood that the bandits left no
truce by which they could be followed.

they get a chance. A number of shots
