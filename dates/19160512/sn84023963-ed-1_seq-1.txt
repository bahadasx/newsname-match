MILITARY TACTICS USED
AT HOOSIER SPEEDWAY
The instant death of a guard at the
Corona, California, race recently only
serves to emphasize the risk involved
in this thrilling sport. The protec
tion of the spectators at the Indian
apolis Motor Speedway has been
worked to a nicety through the ac
cumulated experience of Captain Wil
liam P. Carpenter, who has charge of
the guards at the Indianapolis track.
One would thmk that a punitive ex
pedition was on its way to capture a
bandit could one see Captain Carpen
ter's khaki clad soldiers marching five
miles west of Indianapolis to encamp
a few days before the May 30 event.
"Every regulation of soldier life is
strictly adhered to; tents are pitched,
patrols established and rigid military
tactics are in vogue. The care for
the tremendous throng of specta
tors is a herculean task, but is done
with such apparent ease, and so -effortless
that one is unconscious of its
-magnitude.
Indianapolis Team at New York.
For the first time in the history of
automobile speedway racing, a team
represenf g one speedway has been
entered .n the race of another speed-
way. Three cars from Indianapolis
Motor Speedway are entered for the
New York Race May 13. These are
a Peugeot car and two Maxwells.
John Aitken at the wheel of the Peu
geot and Eddie Rickenbacher and
Pete Henderson driving the Maxwells.
This move is taken as heralding a
new era in speedway racing.
The N'ew Yorl- Speedway Team
will be sent to Indianapolis for the
Sixth International Sweepstakes Race
to be held on ti c Hoosier speedway
! May 30. This ompetition of speed
way teams doe., not in any sense dis
courage any other entrants, as every
driver is out for himself. There are
! no prizes or awards to teams. The
team plan is merely a system for in
suring and providing the very finest
of cars properly built and maintained.

tariumNarcotic Habit
Flourishes in "Dry" Atlanta
That whisky drinking retards the
drug habit and that the use of nar
cotics flourishes in "dry" communities
Is the statement of Dr. H. F. Harris,
Secretary of the Georgia State Board
of Health, who declares the Harrison
drug act a failure and who sees as a
result of Georgiafs new and more
stringent prohibition act a large in
crease in the number of drug addicts.
Here is an account of his findings as
reported in the Atlanta (Ga.) Ameri
can: That whisky drinking tends to retard!
the increase of drug addicts, who are
w !f nnner' iTh bein;
that $50,000 would be necessary for
the State Board of Health to cope sue-
cessfully with the drug habitues now!
requiring treatment in Georgia, and;
that after the new prohibition law goes j
into effect May 1 the state probably
will, need $200,000 to provide for neces
sajyfoataof inebriates and others jwho
will suffer, are three essential points,
in the belief of Dr. H. F. Harris, sec
retary of the State Board of Health,
expressed Saturday.
Drug-Habit Is Disease.
"We have found that there are com-
naratively few addicts in sections
where liquor has been sold or is con-
suined in quantities. Savannah and
as ks
j Augusta, both wide-open cities, have! this was the p in t which puzzled the

tween tnem, while we nave nan
rrom Atlanta, vvnere mountain oew
is popular, in North Georgia, the drug
habit is at a minimum, but it flour-
ishes in South and Central Georgia.
"
Drug taking is a disease, and normal
beings are not affects by it. Only a;
few normal humans ever becom ad-,
diets, and I have knoTn of such per
sons to take morphin for years and
never crave another fiose after the
cessation of pain.
"Mr. Blalock seem to think that
all you have to do i to deprive the
hRbitiiA of h! Hmir n.d th onre 1
natural sequence. Far from it. Only
months of fresh air, physical labor,
good food and considerate treatment,
under the most favorable conditions,
can effect a permanent cure. The
city physicians state that they have
made little headway, if any, in break
ing up the habit among drug users.
"If the Government has been unable
to break up moonshining in many
years, it can not expect a remarkable
and sudden activity, after months of
comparative quiet, to drive us to su
perhuman exertions in controlling a
situation that we deem is beyond con
trol. Harrison Law Failure.
"The Harrison act may do much for
future generations, but it will not be
of much help in curbing the present
drug addicts of Georgia, Mr. Blalock
to the contrary, notwithstanding.
"We shall, I think, need a farm for
drunkards after May 1, if the law is
rigidly enforced. Other states have
realized that intoxication is a disease
and have proceeded to treat it along
that line.
"There are many drug addicts in
Georgia now many of whom are able: 0no of the m,p(. 5 fact.

' GOLDEN NEEDLES.
Thsy Wer Used When Gallantt tu
France Did Fancy Work.
During the old regime in Prance,
about which so much glamour re
mains to us, the very men who were
living and making the history of tha
empire of Louis passed their leisure
time in a way that seems to us of
today utterly ridiculous. In alHhe
fancy work on which ladies employ
ed themselves the luen soem to have
taken part.
Poinsinet in one of his comedies
represents a young marqui? enter
ing a room where two fair dampen
are embroidering. One is working
a piece of dress trimming, the other
a Marly flounce. The beau examines
the embroidery with the eye of a
connoisseur, rjbint3 out here and
there the specially good touches and
$s too polite to notice any defects.
He takes a little gold tube out of
the pocket of his richly decorated
waistcoat and selects a dainty gold
needle. He goes to tho framo at
which Cidalise i3 working and fin
ishes the Hower which she had be
gun. From her he moves to the
Bofa and, seizing one end of the
flounce, assists Ismene, to whom he
Eays special attention, to complete
er task.
At this time it was the custom of
the ladies invariably to carry their
workbags with them to the evening
receptions, in which they had not
only their embroidery materials, but
the last novel, the popular songs,
their patch boxes and rouge pots.
Gentlemen also carried deftly em
broidered little bags into company,
which held "a whole arsenal of cut
lery and fancy articles, such as
boxe3 of different shapes filled with
lozenges, bonbons, snuff and scent."
At another period the fashion of
the day wa3 to cut out llrawinss
from books and pamphlet and to
paste them on screens, lamp fchadev
boxes and vases. The skill in thi
was to so arrange the drawings or
parts of different drawings as to
produce a curious or amusing ef
fect. Then there came a season
when all the rage was for charades
and riddles, which gave a peculiarly
good opportunity to exercise "the
light and rapid wit so conspicuous
in the French. Every evening the
drawing rooms were converted into
impromptu charades. Some lady
would suggest a word or phrase, and
forthwith it would be converted into
the subject of a sprightly little play.
Many of the word games now cur
rent with us in America had their
origin in the necessity the French
salons were under in tho last cen
tury to divert themselves. In some
of the salons the fashion of keep
ing a daily chronicle of news, which
was too often a mere chronicle of
scandal, was adopted. Ime. Dou
blet de Persan issued bulletins
which she called "no ;velles a la
main." In her apartmc ts two reg
isters were kept, one of the authen
tic news received here c1 1 there by
her guests, the olW of renting ru
mors and on dit. and :-.jm these
the budget of lr chronicle was
made up and c;r-n.a:ef throughout
Franco. Applet o . '
