more than ordinarily interesting.

POVERTY AND
TUBERCULOSIS IN
CLOSE RELATION
Most Cases Traceable to Cheap
Lodging Houses and Had
Conditions
By .Associated Press
Washington, D. C., May 12. —The
close relation of poverty to tubercu
losis is emphasized in a report made
public to-day by the Public Health
.Service after an extensive investigation
in many cities. One-sixth of all tuber
culosis cases, it declared, develop in
, cheap lodging houses and one-fifth are
traceable to occupational hazards and
bad working conditions.
As examples, statistics gathered in
Cincinnati and Pittsburgh are cited,
j In the former city's tenement district
! tuberculosis was found to be three
times as great as in the better sections,
j and the average monthly income ot
'■ 107 families In which these cases were
i found was computed as sl7. Much
i the same condition was discovered in
Pittsburgh, where nearly 20,000 fac
tory workmen submitted to physical
examination in the course of investi-
I gat ion.
I The report points out that almost
without exception cities with a higher
percentage of Irish, Scandinavian and
German stock and those in which the
negro population is relatively large
have a corresponding high mortality,
while those of the Italian and .Jewish
element is proportionately great have
a low tuberculosis death rate.
