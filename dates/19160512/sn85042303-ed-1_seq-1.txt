cussed by Secretary Lansing
ranza's Representative at
Washington, D. C, May 12.
Major General Scott's report
of the failure of the conference
with Obregon was considered
at today's cabinet meeting. The
contents of the report were not
disclosed, but there are some
indications that the conference
resulted in an unwritten agree
ment to cover the co-operative
action along the border for the
present.
Secretary of war Baker said
today that the conferees tried
to reach a basis for a written
understanding but that this was
found to be impossible, al
though all exchanges were most
friendly.
It is suggested here that Car
ranza faced by the political sit
uation in Mexico, was unwilling
to make a written agreement
which his opponents could use
as an indication of surrender
of Mexican sovereignty.
After the cabinet meeting,
Baker said the American poli
cy was unchanged. No gener
al intervention in Mexico is in
contemplation at present.
Conferees Leave Border
El Taso, Texas, May 12. Obregon i
started south before daybreak this
morning and Funston and Scott will
leave at 10 tonight, Funston to San
Antonio and Scott to Washington. Fol.
lowing the failure of the conference
with Obregon last night, they are no
longer acting a3 diplomatic agents.
Despite the break, officials here and
at Juarez say that the relations are
not unduly strained. The question of
disposition of Pershing's force will
now be discussed by Secretary Lan
sing, and Arr. dondo, who is the Mex
ican minister at Washington. Gener
al Funston will take immediate com
mand and disposition of the state
militia now being mobilized.
Texas Mobilization Completed
San Antonio, Texas, May 12. The
mobilization of the Texas militia was
practically completed today. The next
step will be to muster them into the
regular army, where they will be giv
en a thorough course in training and
be better equipped. Officials here be
lieve that it will be three weeks be
fore the first militia is sent to the
border.
Awaits Carranza's Orders.
Washington, May 12. Ambassador
Arredondo stated this afternoon that
diplomatic negotiations with Lansing
will not be resumed until he receives
Instructions from Carranza. He be
lieves Scott and Obregon were in
accord on several important subjects.

SINCE WE ARE TO HAVE TWO
REPRESENTATIVES WITH BUT
ONE ANNOUNCEMENT, PEOPLE
ARE WONDERING.
Since Carter county is to have two
representatives in the next legislature
and since there is but one announce
ment so far made, people are begin
ning to wonder who the next one
will be to shy bis bat into the ring
and go to help make the laws of
the great state of Oklahoma.
While people have been wondering,
several of the wise ones have been
busy, and it Is currently rumored that
our fellow townsman, Guy H. Sigler,
a prominent member of the Ardmore
bar, will be a candidate for this office.
The selection of Mr. Sigler would
be a go0(l onPi according
to state-
ments of those who have been advo
cating his candidacy. lie is a young
lawyer who is well versed in the
affairs of the city, county and state,
and would ably represent this con
stituency. Mr. Sigler, when asked
about the matter, was rather non
committal, but it was evident that
he is in the hands of bis friends,
and will make the race if it does not
involve too great a sacrifice.
Several other names have been
suggested as opponents to the candi
date from the western part of the
county, but so far no one has an
nounced, and it begins to look as it
the job of representative will go to
the first two who announce.
Hut then there may be others.

HORRIFIED AT
EXECUTION OF
DR. WILLIAMS EXCELLED ALL
FORMER EFFORTS INTENSE IN
TEREST ARDMORE GIVEN TO
PURSUIT OF PLEASURE.
Ilotli evangelist anil his singer
niaile bin' bits at the tabernacle last
night. .Mr. Hi ay lias been giving his
attention mostly to the boys this week
,11ml with very s.n isiactory results. I h
way those boys can sing! Their most
"taking" number was Hilly Sunday's
famous song, "The Hi-ewers' Hig
Horses Can't Run Over Me." Mr. Hray
excels with the young people, lie is
worth his weight in gold to any
church that 'might be able to secure
his services. No wonder Adam made
a mistake with Cain. Adam had nev
er been a boy and did not know how
a boy felt nor what he wauled to do.
He also made another mistake in not
taking out a patent on a boy. There
is nothing like him anywhere in the
heavens above, in the earth beneath,
nor In any place under the earth. The
most amazing thing is that churches
take so little interest in their boys. If
there is any church within a radius of
Kit) miles that is doing anything for
boys that is worth speaking of, we do
not know it. Why are there no young
men at work in these meetings, lead
ing other young men to Christ? Sim
ply because the boys have been neg
lected. The moss-back leaders In the
church think it Is a big tiling If some
rus'y old sinner with his mouth full
of tobacco and with a quart of boot
leg whiskey under bis belt gives the
fag end of bis life to Christ. And God
be praised for his salvation, say we
all. Hut see here, the work of, the
kingdom will never be done by fag
end followers of Christ whose vital
forces have been burned out by a life
of sin. Give us an army of these
Timothys, and we will show- you won
ders in this city. Why do not the
wealthy men and women in our church
es invest money in boys which will
bring more than 200 per cent for the
kingdom. Money is poured without
stint into exclusive country clubs, golf
links, fishing preserves, automobiles,
social functions and extensive vaca
tions, while the boy is pushed off to
a prosy Sunday school with an
different teacher w ho administers his
gospel dose as old Squears did Ins
tr acle. Then the boy is turned into
the street for the rest of the week
with "the devil take tli" hindmost"
abandon while on goes the low type
of religion as the devil takes the
hindmost, the foremost, arid all in be
tween. These Uip van Winkle church
es better wake up before it is too late.
Some one asked Dr. Williams which
was worse, Sunday baseball or Sunday
golf. "Neither,'' said the evangelist,
"they are botli alike bad, demoraliz-
iiig, calling fortli the wrath of God
and mutually surpass ach other in
wickedness. Each has features pe
culiarly its own, and no Christian
ought to hinder the work of God in
helping the work of the devil. "Hob
and Nabob' alike are sowing to the
wind which will produce the whirlwind
later when all of us must suffer as
they are doing now In Europe.
Dr. Williams' sermon was based on
Gal. 6:7-8. The sermon was easy in
thought and faultless in delivery and
lasted one hour and a quarter. No one
dreamed of its length, such was the
intense interest in his discussion. The
sermon is one of the unreportable
kind, not because of its difficulty but
because of ease. Who can report the
light? Who can dtTlne a brea'h from
the mountain or the ocean? How can
we convey the fragrance of the rose?

TO REGISTER
ERRET DUNLAP STATED THIS
MORNING THAT DEMOCRATS
DID THEIR DUTY IN THE PAST
TEN DAYS.
Erret Dunlap, registrar for Carter
county, stated this morning that ho
was gratified and surprised at tli'J
recent registration in this county,
and from preliminary reports that ho
bad received, was convinced that the
democrats of the county did their
duty and registered within the allot
ted time. Meager reports at the bo
ginning of the registration conveyed
the news that the democrats ero
indifferent and were permitting the
socialists and republicans to outnum
ber them in the matter of registra
tion. -This was all changed during
the last few days the books were
open, and the full strength of the
party will be cast at the coming pri
mary and general elections.
Mr. Dunlap stated that with few ex
ceptions every democrat in the city
had enrolled, and he had no fear of
the party success, either in the city
or country precincts.
