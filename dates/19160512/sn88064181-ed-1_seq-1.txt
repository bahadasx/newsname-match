We purchased two solid cars this season, which guar
antees you just the kind and size wanted, and a price lower
than you could possibly obtain elsewhere. This large
purchase enables us to maintain the same prices we have
made for the past four years, notwithstanding the fact,
that all the factories have advanced their prices over 25
per cent.
This is one of the many advan
tages of buying from us.
A solid car of chain and lawn swings just
received. Our No. 1 swing is made of solid oak,
full bolt construction, has best quality souldered
link galvanized chains, very heavy hooks, aud is
nicely finished the new brown Fumed finish.

An Elaborate Progran
for Mother's Day at
the Methodist Church
,n A special "Mother's )ay"
program has peen arranged for
t Sunday at the Alethodist ('hlrch
is and the generai public is mst
cordially invited to attend.
The ladies of the congreiation
id will furnish appropriate flowers
st i for the occasion and upon enter
It ing the church all will he given
ir the proper flower.
If your mother is living wear
"Yla pink rose; if she is dead wear
;h the white--emblem of purity
and maybe, her dim old eyes
rl now brightened by the celestial
e. rays from the throne of God,
e will look backward next Sunday
and perceive that she has not
a been forgotten..
0j The church should be filled to
!r overflowing for the one to be
le honored on this occasion is a
priceless heritage to all mankind
o and there is not a being so de
a prayed that at the utterance of
is the word "mother" has no
Il visions of happier days gone by
before contact with life's great
. struggles, perchance, has caused
, him to stray far from the paths
le of childhood and father from the
teachings of her to whom he
owes his being.
d Mother, Home and Heaven
are the sweetest words language
l can convey and there is a trinity
al about theme, too. Without a
rn mother there could be no home
for around"bheribein it is build
ed; a place wherein she reigns
supreme; and without the good
christian mothers to guide, guard
-land direct a sin-steeped world
6 to the higher planes of better
6l living, none would ever reach
n the pearly gates of the City of
e God.
t Sunday we meet to honor our
e mothers! Boys, if she is on
this side of eternity, see that
she gets to church. Make an
Sengagement with her; let her
feel and know that the day be
I longs to her. In years agone,
Swhen she was young, she en
Sjoyed having your stalwart dad
I accompany her and today she is
equally as proud of her son.
SDon't let dad do it. If he is
Shere, he, too, will be wearing a
Srose of pink or white and will be
turning the leaves of memory
back to the barefoot, halycon
days of childhood. If you, like
I the writer, are separated from
I mother, write her a letter to
reach her Sunday morning and
tell her how dearly you love her,
tell her of the appreciation you
have for the years of sacrifice
she has made for you; it will do
her good to know that you are
attending church and that you
are wearing a flower bright in
honor of her. Repeat to her the
beautiful sentiment of Tennyson
when he said:
I "My mother's hands-they are neither
white nor small
And you, I know, would scarcely think
them fair at all.
I've looked on hands whose golden hue
a sculptor's dream might be;
Yet are these aged, wrinkled hands
most beautiful tome."

informed of the happenings in
Caldwell Parish.
