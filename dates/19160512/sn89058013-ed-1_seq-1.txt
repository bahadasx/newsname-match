BADLY INJURED
IN A RUNAWAY
While driving out to the home
of E; C. Farrar Monday afternoon
Mrs. Z. Et Sensing and Mrs. L. A.
Wyatt met with a bad accident in
which, both ladies were painfully
if not seriously hurt. . -
Mrs. Sensing was driving, and
one of the front wheels of the
buggy suddenly dropped into a rut
in the road near the home of Ben
Bamett,' colored, and she was
thrown out on the wheel. Her
horse became frightened and ran
away, aud she was, dragged some
distance before the buggy collided
with a tree. and was wrecked.
.Mrs. Wyatt was thrqwu from
the buggy, and, more than likely,
she was thrown against the tree on
which the buggy was wrecked.
A small bone of her arm was frac
tured, her back was wrenched and
she sustained severe injuries in her
hips besides other bruises. Mrs.
Sensing sustained a number of
severe wounds and is very weak
from bleeding.
The accident happened near the
home of Mr. Farrar. Medical aid
was immediately summoned from
town, and after administering to
thqir immediate needs the ladies
were brought home. Unless there
are internal injuries their wounds,
while severe and painful, may not
prove serious. ' i
Mr. Sensing was called home
from Johnsonville', where he has
been employed for some time. As
soon as advised Mr. Wyatt motored
out to the scene of the accident
and brought the wounded home in
his can ,
The proper laundring of collars
has gotten to be a wonderful thingi
There are machines. that make your
collars" smootlr and round at the
neck no matter how old the collar
is, and the same, machine molds a
space on the inside of the collar so
that your tie slips easily and you
don't have to "jerk a crick" iu your
neck every time you put on a clean
collar. This machine, among all
the latest machines made for Qual
ity laundry work, is used by the
Springfield Laundry of Spring
field, Tenn. And Quality laundry
work costs no more than the other
kind. Agents wanted. V,

Do you know what the, great
tribnlatiou is? Not out of "great
tribulation," but otft of "the great.
tribulation," will have come the
great multitude about whom you -read
in Revelation vii. Have you
thought that this tribulation meant
simply such martyrdoms and per
secutions as Nero's or the Bqxer
massacres? 'r Look for the answer.
Why Paul's spectacular conver
sion? People sometimes think it
was "unfair" for God to give Saul
such an extraordinary, anil unique
call to accept Christ. Why should
God do i,t? Will it ever be done
again? , t .
