EVENT SUCCESS.
So successful was the dancing par
ty given last evening In the Eagle

means.
The dance next Thursday evening
promises to be much larger. A num
ber of out-of-town guests last evening
asked permission to sell tickets in
their home communities in order to
make it a county-wide affair.

WASHINGTON, May 12. The bur
den of further negotiations regarding
tne presence of American troops in
Mexico is thrown upon Carranxa. The
cabinet today threshed out the sit

withdrawal request expected until
Arredondo asks for It. Then tbe gov
ernment will answer tnat the expedi
tion will not withdraw until the bor
der is considered safe from further
raids. It was learned officially that
the administration Is not confident
that new terms can be arranged
through diplomats. Obregon told
Scott that he could not write an agree
ment placing Carranxa rn a position
as consenting to the expedition's stay
In Mexico.
Some thought that the administra
tion confronted the most serious sit
uation since the expedition entered
Mexico. It was feared that the Mex
icans will believe the refusal to with
draw means an intention to attack
Mexico. After the cabinet session
an official said: "It looas as though
it is their next move."
It was announced there would ba
no change in the Mexican policy. No
new troop movements were ordered
today. The situation so far as Am
