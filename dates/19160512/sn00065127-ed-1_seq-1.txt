The M. E. School Contest.
Last Sunday, as usual, found a large
number present at the M. K. Sunday
school. A growing interest being
manifest by the regular attendance
of the parents, thereby lending their
influence and support to the el
forts of
the pastor, superintendent and
teachers in a work so vital to the
spiritual training and character build
ing of the coming generation
The contest between the women
and girls vs. the men and boys is
going on with increased rivalry. How
ever after one glance it was very
evident last Sunday that the millinery
department was more than well
represented. The score being 13!)
women and girls to 01 men aud boys.
Never-the-less the men and boys have
so much "confidence in themselves that
they still claim that che women and
girls will have to serve the refresh
ments to the entire school. This
event to take place in the church
parlors some evening next week. Next
Sunday, May 14th, will decide the
question.
If you are not an attendent of one
of the other schools you will be more
than welcome in our midst. As has
been frequently noted in the past,
the Philathea class carried the honors
of the day, by being the largest class
Contributed.
Master Feats Of The Railroad World
Six years ago the country rang with
the accomplishment of the most bril
liant and efficient transcontinental
railroad building of history.
This year the eyes of the nation are
turned to an even more notable
achievement—the placing of 440 miles
of main line across the Continental
Divide under electrical operation.
Both achievements are work of the
same railway—it was the Chicago,
Milwaukee & St. Paul that set a new
record in railway building, by con
structing in less than three years a
splendid steel highway across the
plains, mountains, uplands aud valleys
that lie between the Missouri River
and I'uget Sound. With a series of
brilliant engineering triumphs this
new steel highway was laid directly
through the heart of the Rocky, Bitter
Root and Cascade Mountains.
The result is that the "Milwaukee"
today is the shortest line to the Pa
cific North Coast, with lowest grades
and easiest curves, and leads directly
through the greatest extent of moun
tain scenery on the continent.
Again it is the "Milwaukee" that
detinltely ushers in the new era in
railroading-the era of the electric lo
comotive. Already "The Olympian"
and "The Columbian" are being oper
ated electrically over the first com
pleted unit ok 115 miles, and soon they
will be so operated over the entire
electrified district, extending from
Harlowton, Mont., to Avery, Idaho,
a distance of 440 miles.
It has always been the aim of this
railway to furnish service better than
the best obtainable elsewhere. Every
travel delight and comfort is yours if
you travel on the "Milwaukee" to
the Pacific North Coast.
For literature and full information,
apply to local ticket agent of this
railway.

Count Tolstoi has woven a wonder
fully compelling aud heart gripping
story about the life of Ills heroine,
Miriam, a young Russian girl.
Through an unfortunate love affair
Miriam Is threatened with disgrace.
Her father Induces Gregor Randor, a
struggling musician, to marry her,
for money consideration, and the
couple go to America where they are
later followed by Miriam's family,

Celia and Gtegor a clandestine love
affair develops. Despite their secrecy
the wife discovers the truth and torn
between love of her little boy and
outraged pride, she confronts her
fickle husband and unnatural sister.
Her revlilngs and the denunciations
of her father are alike unavailing and
at last, driven to desperation, she
takes vengeance into her own hands.
