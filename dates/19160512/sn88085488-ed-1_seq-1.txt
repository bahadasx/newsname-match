lor Industrial Insurance
< ommissioii
Forest i. Gill, for several years
a resident of Pullman, and sun of
IC. G. Gill, was Wednesday named
by Governor Ernest Lister as one
of the three members of the Indus
trial Insurance commission, to take
effect June 1. Mr. Gill attended the i
Si,lie College here for a number of
years, later going to Tekoa as cash
ier of a hank, and resigning that po- i
sition to accept that of deputy stale
hank examiner under W. E, Han
son, also a Pullman man. Other ,
appointees to the commission are E.
W. Olson, slate labor commissioner,
and John M. Wilson, assistant at
tome) general, The two former are
democrats and Mr. Wilson a repub
lican.
The three new members succeed 1
Floyd L. Daggett, A. B. Ernst and!
Clarence Parker. Mr. Parker has al
read) resigned and Commissioners j
Daggett and Ernst, while refusing to
resign formally upon he request of
Governor Lister, have announced
that they will step out June l to
make way for the new men.
Governor Lister said relative to
the appointments: "Mr. Olson as I
labor commissioner has made an ex
cellent record in that position. His
work has been satisfactory to em
ploye and employer alike. John M.
Wilson, assistant attorney general,
who is appointed to fill one of the
places, has handled the legal work of
the industrial department for the last
two years, bad charge, in connection
with Attorney General Tanner, of the
Investigation of the fraudulent claims 1
of the industrial insurance depart
! ment, and also of the trials of those
implicated In the frauds. Mr. Gill
has had many years banking experi- >■
ence and has been deputy bank ex
aminer under W. E. Hanson for about !
three years. His general experience
and his experience as an accountant
ought to make him a valuable mem
■ her of the board."

matter under advisement, but will

that the rock bore the precious min

pieces of rock from the cliff and at
once sent them to the mining lab ou
tories c! the state college, there to
be examined. The reply that came
from the college authorities convinc
ed the man that there was a strong
probability of the find proving ->f i
value. The assayer's report on the
rocks showed that one piece carried
gold at the rate of $12 per ton. The
assayer requested more samples of ;
the rock. Accordingly he was sup
plied with several other samples,
which assayed from $12 to $:'.!' per
ton, showing conclusively that the
ore Is valuable.
