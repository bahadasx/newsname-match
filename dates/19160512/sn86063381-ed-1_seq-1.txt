si
TAXPAYERS MEET
AND DISCUSS NEW
LAKESHORE HIGHWAY
Majority Approve Aotion of City
Council in Selecting Second
Street Plan.
RAILWAY AND CITY
AUTHORITIES PRESENT
Pointed Out That New Route is Not
Very Expensive Difference in
Cost of $600.
Thirty taxpayers of Bemidji, in
cluding prominent business men, met
at the Commercial club rooms last
evening and and discussed the build
ing of a bridge over the inlet of the
Mississippi and a new highway to
Nymore. A majority of the men
present approved the action taken by
the city council at its last meeting
and agreed to support the council in
its decision.
Railway to Fight.
The council, after much delibera
tion and consideration, at its last
meeting requested the city attorney
to draw up a resolution for the con
struction of a new highway from
Nymore on the lake shore to Second
street. Minnesota & International
railway officials state that they will
not permit the opening of Second
street and that they will fight the
project in courts.
Much Talk.
There has been much street corner
talk in regard to the project and
the meeting last evening was called
so that citizens could express their
views. E. H. Denu, president of the
Commercial club, presided at the
meeting.
Considered for Years.
Tom Swinson, city engineer, told
the meeting of the various projects.
He stated that the matter had been
considered for many years and that
no action had been taken. The rail
way company submitted several pro
positions, but all, according to Mr.
Swinson, had some strings attached
to them. He pointed out that the
city was supposed to 40 feet at the
present railway crossing on Bemidji
avenue but that they only had 30
feet, the balance being used by the
railway company.
$600 Difference,
Mr. Swinson quoted estimates
showing that the repairing of the
present crossing would cost $3,600
less than the construction of a lake
shore highway, but that on the lake
shore highway $2,000 would be as
sessable to the railway company and
it would cost the city $1,000 to move
the steel towers if the present cross
ing was to be improved. The differ
ence, with these exceptions, between
the two projects would only be $600.
Should Open Second.
F. S. Lycan, president of the city
council, stated that he did not know
why Second street should be closed.
"Second street should be opened
whether the Nymore highway is con
structed on that route or not. Per
haps some day the city would want
to construct a pier there. The only
street going to the lake now is
Third street," said Mr. Lycan.
O. J. Laqua stated that the present
bridge and crossing were disgraceful.
He spoke in favor of the Second
street route.
Offers Compromise.
C. M. Bacon advocated construct
ing the road on the lake shore but
instead of going to Second street to
run a street at the end of the present
railway tracks between Second and
Third streets.
N. L. Hakkerup spoke in favor of
Mr. Bacon's plan as a compromise
with the railway company.
"The matter was up to the council
and settled by them at the last
meeting," said George T. Baker. "I
think that the council knows its
business. I favor the Second street
route."
Walker Gives Talk.
G. A. Walker, of the Minnesota &
International railway, speaking as a
taxpayer, stated that he believed that
the present crossing could be made
safe.
"If the city owns 40 feet at the
present crossing as claimed by the
city engineer," said Mr. Walker, "I
believe that the city should claim it.
I am sure that the M. & I. does not
want property that does not right
fully belong to them. I am also sure
that the M. & I. is ready to co-oper
ate with the city in making the pres
ent crossing adequate. The M. & I.
will fight the opening of Second
street, however, as it cuts the yards
in two."
Favors Second Street.
Alderman J. P. Lahr stated that he
favored the Second street route.
W. Z. Robinson stated that he did
not believe that Second street should
be closed.
A, B. Palmer spoke against the
present crossing, stating that he fa
vored the lake shore route, favoring
the route to Third street more than
to Second street.
"The city should be entitled to
cross Second street," said Alderman
John Moberg.
For Present Route.
George Kreatz spoke in favor of
the present crossing being im
proved.
A. B. Peir advocated building the
highway where it would be the least
expensive and still be a permanent
improvement.
J. L. George, county auditor, ad
vised against high taxes but stated
that he believed the Second street
crossing the better.
Edward Jackson advised the secur
ing of the 40-foot stretch of land
which is reported as owned by the
city at the present crossing.
Present Crossing Unsafe.
"Whether they can make the pres
ent crossing safe is a question," said
Dr. C. R. Sanborn. "It is absolutely
dangerous the way it is."
C. A. Huffman spoke in favor of
the lake shore route. H. Cominsky
advised the cheapest and most per
manent route.
J. J. Trask talked against the Sec
ond street crossing, stating that it
looked as if the city had singled out
the M. & I. for attack.
"I know the M. & I. has been a
cordial friend to Bemidji," he said.
"I am most emphatically in favor of
letting the road stay where it is."
Support Council.
"After the city council has con
sidered the matter for years, I feel
that they are the best qualified to
judge," said Attorney Thayer C.
Bailey. "As representative of the
city, they have the city at heart as
much, if not more, than we have.
Before they made their decision, I
am sure that the problem of taxa
tion was taken into consideration.
Mr. Swinson's estimates are reliable."
H. E. Reynolds stated that if the
council had arrived at a decision he
was satisfied.
"I am willing to support and back
up the council in its decision," he
said.
A. M. Bagley spoke in favor of the
lake shore route.
Attorney H. J. Loud advocated
making the present crossing safe for
the time being and to later on con
struct the Second street route.

The same as you.

Upon your silent bier,

-HOP
CONFERENCE ON
BORDER ABANDONED
WITHOUT AGREEMENT
Situation Now is Practically as it
Was When Conferences
STATEMENT IS MADE
BY GENERALS NO BBEAK
American Soldiers Continue to Cross
the Border Into
Mexico.
Washington, May 12.The
Mexican situation is the most
serious since the United States
forces entered Mexico on ac
count of the El Paso conference.
Secretary Baker has directed
General Scott to return to Wash
ington and General Funston to
San Antonio.
El Paso, May 12.The American
and Mexican conferees last evening
announced they had decided to sus
pend their conferences and report
back to their respective governments
in order that the latter may conclude
the negotiations through their re
spective foreign departments.
After almost two weeks of discus
sion thie conferences of Generals
Scott, Funston and Obregon over the
American troops disposition in Mex
ico came to an end without any
agreement being reached.
The entire matter was referred
back to the American and Mexican
governments to be settled by diplo
matic channels.
Back at Start.
Today the situation is almost ex
actly what it was before the confer
ences began. The Mexican govern
ment still insists upon the withdraw
al of General Pershing's troops upon
a certain date, and wants that date
to be soon. It is claimed that Gen
eral Obregon has been willing to
make concessions in order to reach an
agreement with the American con
ferees, but that he was overruled by
First Chief Carranza and his ad
visors.
After practically conceding the de
mahds of the American conferees,
General Obregon was compelled to re
verse his attitude, according to relia
ble sources of information here. The
end of the negotiations came yester
day after two conferences had been
held.
General Funston gave but the fol
lowing statement:
Make Statement.
"We wish to announce that after
several conferences, marked through
out with conspicuous courtesy and
good will, in which conferences mut
ual expressions were exchanged and
information was collected on the mili
tary situation on the frontier, it was
agreed by the conferees to suspend
the conferences and report back to
their governments, in order that they
may be able, through their respective
forergn departments, to conclude this
matter and that the ending of these
conferences does not mean in any
way a rapture of the good relation
of friendship between the conferees
nor between their respective govern
ments.
Signed:
"A. Obregon,
"H. L. Scott,
"Frederick Funston."
The only break that could possibly
come would follow an attack by Car
ranza troops upon American troops.
