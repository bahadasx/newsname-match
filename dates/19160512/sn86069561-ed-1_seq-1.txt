Of course you'll want at'least one serviceable suit
for "all occasion" use this spring
You have more room for choice this year, for we ve
secured a beautiful new Clothcraft gray serge suit,
'6130' from the same house that makes the well
known "5130" Blue.
You'll wonder how it's possible to get so much
good style and careful workmanship for $ 1500
It's bscause-the makers have specialized on medium-priced clothes

It's a case where good wages, fair treatment and high ideals hare
produced better quality at lower cost.
