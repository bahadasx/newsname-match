New Mexico
Tlc New Crystal Company
has established another moving
pictur show just west of the old
one. Moth shows are being
operated by the same company
but a different program is put
on and the people havu thu op
ixirtunity of seeing two first
class picture snows each night.
The high class pictures being
shown compare favorably with
thosu seen in any large city and
the fact that they are being en
joyed Is proven by the large
crowds that are present at every
performance
The Foreigner in a Foreign Land
Two so called newspaper cor
respondents whoso names we
feel it would be a disgrace to
even mention, published articles
in the El Paso Times and El Paso
Herald lately that should not go
unchallunged. They have tried
to draw a picture of Columbus
without any regard for truth
whatever, and have sui ceeded in
describing a town which, if real
ly existed, would not only be a
disgrace to the United States,
but to civilization.
We have neither the time or
patience to go into details with
the prevaricators, but they are
a few things that we desiro to
bring to attention. Columbus
has suffered enough during the
past two months from things
that was apparently beyond the
control of our national govern
ment, without having to suffer
from thu falsehoods of unscru
pulous journalists of the type in
question.
Coluumbus is a small town,
and the class of buildings, the
streets, and general conditions,
will compare favorably with a.jy
tow n of its size in the United
States, with only one exception,
ind that is shade trees. Our
oldest buildings were construct
ed live or six years ago, and in
the raiu some of the .best were
destroyed. The lands tieur town
are, in a large measure, un
developed and we are anxious to
get settlers men who will do
something- and we are always
glad to have the exact facts in
regard to Columbus and the
lower Mimbres Valley publish
ed. Generally speaking, the
newspaper curresioudents who
have visited us since the raid,
have published nothing that
would olleiid anyone, and we
must admit that they, on an
average, aro as decent a sort as
you can find, but thu two men
referred to above do not desurve
to be classed with them at all,
and are a disgrace to thu profes
siun.
To give an idea of the kind ol
stuff the articles were made up
if we mention thu following:
In the articlu published in the
El Paso Herald the writer re
forred to thu stranger in Colum
bus as. a "foreigner in a foreign
land." Ho was, according to his
views, a different sort of being
from tho citizen. Now we would
havu him know that our citizen
ship is made up of people from
every part of the country.
Residents can be found here
from practically all thu largest
cities in thu United States, and
our oldest inhabitants, with but
one or two exceptions, have
come here sjneo the year of
1010. When we consider this
it is hard for us to believe that a
man who would write such stuff
can boa real citizen of tho United
States, and he must undoubted
ly havo been tho only stranger
In town.
The same man also referred to
tho mnnarer of the moving
Mr. and Mrs. L. J. Peach have
leased their restaurant to Joe
Stephenson, who will conduct
the business in tho business in
the future. Mr. and Mrs. Peach
left Thursdoy for an extended
visit with their children in Tex
as, Kansas, and Ohio, and expect
to be away for at least one
month. It has been twenty
years since Mrs. Peach saw the
children and it has been four
teen years since Mrs. Peach last
seen thetn, and they feel that
they have well earned a visit to
their old home.

using a brogue that would prob
ably be heard in tho most remote
part of the mountains of Ken
tucky, tho substance of which
was Mint there was only one
show a week in Columbus prior
to the raid. Another falsehood.
The lirst picture show was
established here about three
yt.rars ago, and since that time
with the exception of a few
nights just after the raid, there!
has been a show every night.
We might also mention that the
said manager is a product of one
of the bust known universities in
the west, was engaged in the
banking business in Oklahoma
for a number of years, and at
present is the president and
principal share owner in the
Columbus Statu Bank.

who is a graduto of a Kansas
Law School, practiced law ir.

he retired, and settled here be
cause of the excellent climate,
and lias been connected with
some large eastern banking
muses a an officer, wn. ijuolid
as having used a brogue that was
entirely new to this section.
Practically every statement
made in the articles referred to
wore absolutely false without an
iota of truth in them and the
authors proved themselves tirst
class liars. It is regretted that
such men exist and for their
benefit we advise them to steur
lea- of Columbus in tho future.

We!! Now Under Way
The test well for oil is under
way at last. E. C. Kniffin h is
secured leases and Is now drill
ing only a short distance from
the old Anderson well In which
oil was found. Ho is starting
with a twelve inch hole and if
necessary will reduce, to a small
er one later. The rig of K. W.
Elliott is being used, and as they
have the service of an expert
driller, F. L. Painter, no delay
is anticipated.
All necessary equipment is on
the ground ano it is expected
that a hole can be sunk to the
depth of about 2,000 feet within
four months. Mr. Kniftin has
iiad a wide experience in oil
fields in California and other
places, and is a geologist with a
wido practical exporienco, and is
not by any means going into
something that he knows noth
ing about. Tho future of this
section depends much on the
outcome of this drilling, and the
Courier will endeavor to keep its
readers posted on the results as
the work progresses.
