Election for the office of school
trustees was- held at the school build

number of votes were cast, which re
sulted in the election of J. H. Fish
and George W. Mothershead, who
were appointed early in the year to
fill out the unexpired term of E. L.
Wise and Walter Daves. Both of

England, Germany and
France Agree
on one thing, if on no other. They all prohibit
the sale of alum baking powders.
There must be a good reason for this.
It is because alum was found to be un
heal thful.
Royal Baking Powder is made of cream,
of tartar, derived from graces, a natural
food product,, and contains no alum nor
other questionable ingredients.

MRS. ED HAMER
AGAIN IN LEAD
In Bee's Cincinnati-Louisville
River Contest Trip
BILL OLDHAM SECOND
Mrs. Ed Hamer, of this city, is
again in the lead in the contest and
says she is going after the $50.00
Silver set. Bill Oldham, of this city
is second and says he wants the sil
ver set and is going to win it. There
are others who have their minds
made-up that they will win the set
so it is hard to guess wharwill get it
in the end. The time is now just
right to begin hard work on this con
test as there are only five weeks more
until the contest ends and there will
be more work done in these 5 weeks
than there has been up to this time.
There are about eight or nine, of the
contestants that are very nearly equal
in the matter of votes and any of
this number can win the first place
by a little extra effort and the first
place entitles the winner to this de
lightful trip and the $50.00 Silver set
free. We have on a good proposj
tion now and one thai will be easy to
work, we are giving the Evansville
Courier daily by mail from now to
Oct. 1st. The McCalls Magazine
and The Bee one year all for $2.00,
this gets you 2,000 votes and is a
splendid combination, tell your
friends about it and see how quickly
they will accept an offer of this kind.
