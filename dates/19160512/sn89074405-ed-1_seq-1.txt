Marcel Hntln says: "We are

IRISH EXPORTS
If HAVE INCREASED
Dublin, Ireland, May 12.—Irish ex
ports have Increased considerably on
account of the war. The official re
turns Just completed for the year
1914 show a total of 7t,S00,000
pounds, an increase "of three and a
half million pounds over 1918. The
increase is due almost entirely to the
shipbuilding at Beltu^.
It is a curious feature of the report
th^t although" 5 4 per cent bf ^the Irish
exports, are represented by farm
produce and foodstuff*, thirty-seven
per cent of Ireland's 7t,000,000
pounds of imports should be food, and
the department of agriculture com
ments pointedly on the fact that a
food-producing country should be an
nually importing great quantitlee of
farm produce, much of which is ad
mirably suited for raising at home.
On the whole the report is regard
ed as a gratifying record of contin
ued progress in Ireland. In addition
to the increase In exports, the decade
has also witnessed an Increase of im
ports by'36 per cent in value and IS
per cent in bulk. The total imports
and exports of Ireland, in fact, now
represent a higher per capita value
than the average for ther United
Ktngdom, .the United States, France
or Germany.

WILSON'S REQUEST
Various Charges Against
Him Led to President's
Demand.
London, May IS.—A Central News
dispatch from Amsterdam says that
Captain Karl Boy-ed, formerly Ger
man naval attache at Washington, has
been decorated with the Order of the
Red Eagle of the third class, with
swords, by Bmjperor 'William. Cap
tain Boy-ed was appointed to the
Washington embassy in December,
1911.
After various charges had been
made against him in regard to his
intrigues in Mexico, President Wilson
requested his recall.
After the president had declined a
request from Berlin to explain the
reasons for the demand for Boy-red's
recall, the attache was ordered home
last December.
Charges against Boy-ed continued
after his departure from this oountry
in March of this year, when Horst
von Der Oolta arrived In New fork
in oonnection with the plot to blowup
the Wfelland canal In Canada. He
had a statement charging that Boy-ed
