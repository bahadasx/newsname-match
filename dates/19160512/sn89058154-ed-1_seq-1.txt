NEW YORK X
i LETTER
Well, bad my peep at . New York's
"400" on Monday night of , this week.
Ambassador Bakhmeteff and wife, of
the Russian Embassy at Washington
gave a grand ball and concert at the
Waldorf-Astoria, the largest and fin
est hotel in New York, for the ben
efit of war Bufferers. Tickets were five
dollars apiece, but I went in as ' the
invited gnest of Prince Joseph Loris
Melikoff First Secretary of the Rus
sian Embassy, for whom I did a lot
of official translations of documents
from the Russian janguage into En
glish, before coming here; did it of
evenings and mornings at home, so as
not to interfere with my official duties.
The Prince has never forgotten wbat
I did for him, and he has been not
only grateful, but has done graceful
things for me. , But he will soon
leave for the Far East, for 'the Rus
sian government has promoted him
to the high post of Minister to Siam,
and I may never see him again. A
polished, perfect gentleman, a de
scendant' of kings and yet so nice and
"approachable, and a good friend of
the United States. There are many
kinds of people in this world, and the
most of them cannot be polished or
delicate in manners and in looks,' but
there have to be some who do the fine
-work of diplomacy: they are the eyes
and feelers for : their govenmenta in
foreign lands,' and are born ' to the
job. . This Russian prince never
worked with bis muscles for a living,
although he has had a ' wonderful
career, as Secretary of the Second
Hague Conference for universal peace;
, went through the Northeast Passage
in the noted shipFrara with the ex-
" plorer Nansen, and did half a dozen
things to make him famous, I will
Bay more about him later on." -
1 had to dress in evening attire,
which meant that my coat tails were
, cut back as far as my pants pockets,
the narrow tails hanging way down,
my yest was dazzling white, my tie of
the same color, elo.' My own mother
' would hardly have known me. This
is the second time in my life that I
have had such togs on. and I don't
caret for any more of It. A r?gular
course of such experience would pnfit
i man for the serious work demanded
in my position here. . But an occasion
like this "can never be forgotten, and
. ts worth having. ,.' , . , .
In the greatbalI-room of the hotl,
. larger than many theaters, were gath
ered a cultured audience representing
several nations. Up in the boxes,
looking down on the stage and au
dience, were many, of New York's fab
ulously rich people: Mrs. Cornelius
..Vanderbilt, in plain silk with a few
diamonds; younger members of the
- Astor family who own hundreds of
acres of buildings in the heart of the
city; men famous in the political his
tory of this countryi such as Bourke
Cochran and Charles R. Crane; while
In the main box fronting" the stage,
the American and Russian, 'flags1
draped beneath him, sat the Russian
Ambassador and Madam Bakhmatiff,
surrounded by Princes, Dukes and
other grandees of Russia, and mem
bers of the - Embassy Staff. The
Princess Obolensky sat by the Am
bassadress; on the other side was the
Princess Troubetzkoi, and in blazing
jewels sat others whom I did not
know. During a lull in the music, I
went into the Ambassadorial box and
was immediatly recognized by the
Ambassador and his wife, with whom
I had ' dined twice in v Washington.
The Ambassador introduced me to
Baron Wilenkin of the Russian Em
bassy in London, now here on a Bpecial
mission for the Russian Minister
of Finance, as "an Amerioan who had
learned Russian without having been
in Russia," and as having "made val
uable translations from that language
into English." The introduction was
all made in Russian, but for fear of
spoiling your types, 1 will not try to
repeat it here, except to say that
"Predstavlyayu Vam Gospodeen Per
kins" was the form of introduction.
Wilenkin-is a very tall, keen-eyed
man, but with a wan smile around his
mouth suggesting a poetic spirit.
Prince Loris-Melikoff introduced me
to Prince Troubetzkoi as a "Molodetz"
who spoke Russian, and I bad a rare
chance to air my rather rusty knowl
edge of that difficult language.
Prince Troubetzkoy is tall, heavy and
keen-looking, but would pass for a
prosperous American lawyer or judge
rather than a foreign nobleman.
Mr. Popiloff and Professor Petrun
kevitch of Yale, Councillor Gartz of
the . Russian Consulate, and several
others whose names I did not catch,
were also introduced to me, and with
the Yale professor I had a long and
delightful confab. His father was
one of the most eminent members of
the Russian Duma or Congress. His
Russian was the easiest' to under
stand that I ever heard. Both Popil
off and Petrankevitch (the third syl
lable of which is pronounced like
' kay", and it has the accent) have
American wives, and Mrs. Popiloff
spoke Russian like her husband. They
all seemed to think it was a big thing
for me to have learned the language
here, but I told them of an American
in Washington who has learned thirty
two languages, including Russian and
Chinese, without having been outside
the United States, and who Bpoke
Russian far better than I do.
There is something exhilerating in
moving about in a throng like that,
heaffng tnelowTpolite conversation
in French, English, Russian and Ital
ian; smelling the perfume of the
long-stemmed, roses and snowy gar
denias, or Cape jessamine; seeing the
wonderful costumes and the ropes of
pearls; emerald pendants and coronets
of diamonds. On the breast of the
Russian Embassadress hung emeralds
as large as small BUgar-pears, and in
her hair were diamonds . worth per
haps as much as all the real estate in
McNairy county. There were little
wings encrusted with' diamonds over
the eawof some of the women, but
there were the loveliest girla there-
flower girl8,selling roses and gardenias
for a dollar apiece, their faces much
more beautiful than the flowers. It
was hard 'to keep my eyes off them;
some of .them, speaking Russian, had
cheeks like the dawn and hair and
eyebrows of midnight blackness, and
there were two pale sisters with the
most wonderful eyes, looking like big
daisies, that I have ' ever sen, their,
tongues going at lightning speed in
talking the Janguage of the Czar.
Well, it was like a dream in fairy
land: the frescoed pillars and lofty
ceiling of the grand ball-room looking
like an Egyptian temple; the stair
ways leading up the boxes far toward
the ceiling carpeted in crimson plush;
here was a banquet room in which
champaign (which looks and tastes
like hard cider) was served in little
flat glasses at tables to the few who
called for It, at a dollar a glass; halls
where the flower-girls, who belonged
to the upper rten themselves, were
coining money for the war sufferers,
and so many halls and rooms, all filled
with elegant, chatting foreigners and
Americans, that ft was bewildering to
try to keep track of they all Twenty
thousand dollars was realised.
There is no uae trying to describe
what was transpiring oa the Btage,
except in a geueral way. When I
went In a Russian balalaika concert
waa going on. The balalaika is a
sort of cross between a banjo and a
mandolin, and there were ten per
formers. The tones swept through
the great ball-room,'' now loud and
resonant, and now sinking to a soft
whisper, all in the minor melancholy
Slavic keys that 'they love bo well.
Exquisite piano playing was heard;
the A-flat nocturne of Chopin, a tone-
picture of crystal clearness, speaking
to the soul in a language without
words, and higher than' words. Then
there was toe-dancing, a girl repre
senting a swan, flitting around on the
tips of her toes; then there was
dancing wTiich would have made our
grandmammas NUFF SED. There
were Egyptian dances which made
one feel creepy, and a lot of singing
in French and other languages that
was sweet. ; , . - '
I left at half-past twelve, just as
the banquet whs announced, went
across the street and got me a glass
of milk and a wedge of rhubarb pie.
went home and felt much better the
next morning than if I had spent an
hour at the banquet table at the Waldorf-Astoria.
I had seen enough of
that mealstrom of society, in which,
when once engulfed, one loses his
taste for the ordinary, useful things
of life, and where a Tennessee chap
like me would be about as much at
home as a catfish in the parlor at the
house of Clem Lea. f
In closing I will say a few words
about Prince Loris-Melikoff. '. I wish
it were possible for me to describe
this Russian nobleman as he really
looks. He comes about tip to iry
shoulder, his eyes are black, as 'ripe
muscadines, bis hair the same, and he
has the most perfect manners of any
one I have ever seen. It would be
impossible for him to make a mistake
in that line, or to offend you. His
nose is long and keen, and his fore
head retreating, but there is a peren
nial smile on his dark-complexioned
countenance," and there is not the
slightest awkwardness in any of his
movements. , As soon as I ' would en-;
ter his office in the chancellery of the
Russian Embassy at Washington, he
would ring for the servant and have
grape juice and crackers brought in,
for he knew I liked them. He also
bad fragrant Russian tea brought in,
which he made himself by pouring hot
water over the dry leaves and such
tea as it was! .Only the diplomatic
corps and other highly privileged per
sons can get it. It is said to be made
ffoia the. tipB of thff bod-leaves of the
tea plant, gathered when the dew is
on it, and costs several dollars a
pound. But, honestly, ' the tea we
used to make ef cross-yine leaves in
McNairy tasted better to me, for I
don't care for store tea, and sassafras
beats it all-hollow. Prince Loris
Melikoff has presented me ; his
photograph, with a personal dedi
cation to me underneath, and it showB
him in the full uniform and regalia of
his rank as Chamberlain of the Em
peror of Russia, while on his breast
are the jeweled and bespangled deco
rations showing the high honors and
orders his government - has bestowed
upon him.--"'As I 'said before there
must be a delicate and high-bred class,
even thongh email, to do- the diplo
matic work; there must be butterflies
and humming-birds as - well as hens
and eagles, and my friend the Prince
is one of the delicate ones, but a most
useful man be, is, too. Such men
help keep the balance of peace among
nations, and an incautious word from
one of them echoes around the world,
while their silent, able work often
averts war. J He invited me to visit
him at his new Embassy at Bangkok,
Siam, but it is a safe bet that he will
never see me there, on the other side
of the world. I hardly know where
to look for it on the map. He told
me that in that far-off country the
United States would have a good
friend, in him. He was happy yester
day because the Ciar had conferred
on him a new decoration, that of St.
Vladimir, the name meaning "Ruler
of the World". I shall never see him
again, perhaps, but while life lasts I
shall not forget Prince Joseph Loris
Melikoff of Russia and his graceful
kindness to ma. Vs
In closing, it may be well to say
that I never, no matter what the sur
rounding, have forgotten that I am
an American; a sovereign citizen of
the greatest country on earth; that I
have never been carried away by the
glamor of noble birth or the gliiter
of jewels, but have not failed to re-
rspond to kindness and courtesy, no
matter what the . source, and those
whom t have met in high station have
thought all the more of me because I
respected myself and my country.
