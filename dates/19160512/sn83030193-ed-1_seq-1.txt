contemplation, Secretary IJaker said. He indicated that no general inter
vention in .Mexico was being thought of at present.
It was made plain that the Administration has no intention of with
drawing American troops until it is definitely established that tlie danger
of further border raids has been removed.
The President will take no further stops until Oon. Scott returns from
the border. Tho Adinltilstr,atlou considers the next move ud to Oen.
