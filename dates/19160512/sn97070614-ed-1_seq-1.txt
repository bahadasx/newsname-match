Home Rule Petitions.
Petitions asking the submission of
tbe home rule or township option on
the liquor question are bein circulated
in Michigan, in tbe hope that a vote
may be forced at the November elec
tion at the same time the question of
state wide prohibition is submitted.
Tbe effect will be to mix the questions
np as it did in Ohio and might result in
voters . in their confusion not casting
their ballot as they intend. The effect
of the passage of the home rule law if
state wide prohibition is defeated,
would be to do away with county local
option and make possible saloon pre
cincts in every county practically
nullifying the entire ground gained by
the temperance forces.

damaged. Mr. Hankins escaped in
jury, but his brother, Herbert J., rid
ing with him, sustained a bad scalp
wonnd and several bruises.
The party had spent the day in Flint
and were on their way home when the
accident occurred. The, outlook : was
obstructed by box cars standing near
the crossing and the engine was seen
just in time to allow Mr. Hankins to
throw on all the power, . and the ma
chinH lunged just far enough ahead so
that the rear wheel and the back of the
body was etrnck and the machine
whirled around. The men were not
thrown out They were able to go to
Dr. Arnold's office, and after the
wounds were dressed, went to their
homes in Elsie.
The men did not hear the engine
whistle, if one was blown, and the
quick decision of Mr. Hankins to throw
on the power nndonbtedly saved, their
lives. . .
"The Battfe Cry of Peace."
"The Battle Cry of Peace" deals
with the subject which is today near
est the heart of every American cit
izen the problem of America's un
preparcdness. It portrays the defenseless condi
tion of our country; the consequenc
es to which this condition may lead;
and the way to avoid these conse
quences. The 'City of New York is attacked
by a powerful foreign foe. You are
an eye-witness. You see the enemy
approaching the powerlessness of tho
city, the Inadequacy of its forts and
defenses. You see the havoc wrought
by the enemy's cruisers, its subma
rines, Its airships by Its shells,
shrapnel, bombs. You see the most
beautiful' skyline in the world in
flames; the metropolis of the west
ern hemisphere devastated.
You see New York fall into the
hands of the enemy; and the dese
cration that follows.
Then you are shown the way that
such a calamity can be avoided the
one way. You aro shown the way to
peace the peace for which America
so earnestly prays the peace with
honor. The Battle Cry of Peace was
written by J. Stuart Blackton and
Vitagraphed under his personal sup
ervision on a scale never before at
tempted in motion pictures.
Acknowledgment is mado to Hud
son Maxim, International authority
on arm" and ammunition, for facts
