It was suggested that General Car

in Mexico, was unwillingto make any

surrender of sovereign rights. Under
that theory. General Obregon, it is

Victim of Mysterious Shot,
Youth of 16 is Taken to
Hospital. . , "
A most mysterious shooting, which
"has been kept from the public for
nearly s week, and as a result of
which Edward Thomas Lynch, aged
16 now- lies in p. precarious condition
in St. "Vincent's hospital has mystif led
the parents of the youth, Mr. and Mrs.

reported to the police who will prob
ably begin an investigation into the
affair.

scouting expedition with about 25 oth
er boys last Sunday ' morning. They
planned to go toward Newtown.- Who
the boys were, ' where they went or
when the shooting occurred is not

the name of the people who .'convey

tween here and Newtown and near
where the shooting occurred. V
Dn W. H. Curley ywas summoned
and he decided that the boy should
be taken to the hospital, where he
was immediately removed.
"My only care has been for my
boy," said tlie mother today. "I
don't know what happened to him
and I am willing to wait . until he is
well enough to tell me."

GO TO FUNERAL

band If She Thought She J
Couldn't Take Own Life.
Mary Papp, the youthful Canadian
woman who yesterday shot and killed
her husband in the Bridgeport Metal
Goods factory was arraigned in the
city court today charged with mur
der. At ' the request of Atttorney
Jacob Klein, retained in her defense,
and also that the coroner , may con
clude the inquest, trial Was postpone
ed until May 18.
Anticipating any attempt of Mrs.'
Papp to end her life careful guard is
kept by Police Matron Mrs. David
Jack over the . cell in . which She is
confined. Her temporary detention at
the county Jail quarters will be ar
ranged tonight. : . ' r
A sister in Welland', Canada, notified
of the -occurrence is hastening to this
city to aid Mrs. Papp. No appeal has
been made by the prisoner to heiS well-to-do
parents In Canada, owing to a
rupture that has existed for a period
of five years, causted, it is said here,
by the marriage of the young girl to
Nicholas Papp, without parental con
sent. Arrangements for the burial of
Papp from St. Stephen's Hungarian
Catholic church on. Monday are being
made by the shopniates of the pair at
the Metal Goods Co., where both were
well liked. Undertaker Frank Polke
will have charge of the funeral and
the body will be 'laid to rest in either
St. Michael's or Mountain Grove cem
eteries. '
Mrs. Papp has demanded that she
be permitted to atttend the obsequies
and the police are arranging to grant
her wish. . She will be escorted by at
least two, detectives.both to the church
and to the grave. 1
In her cell, where, she : has been
stripped of all artices with which she
might" - harm herself, : the young girl
cries continually. She declares that
Nicholas Papp is the only man she
loved or ever could love. She reiter
ates the statement that she would not
have killed him but for the belief that
she could end her own life and there
by be with him in death.
Search of the body and effects of
Papp yesterday revealed $174 in cash
in the pockets of the murdered man,
as well as a life insurance policy f or
J500 made payable to Mrs. Papp ' as
beneficiary. : The young woman de
clares that both of these moneys were
unknown to her. ' The impression pre
vails that having killed her husband
Mrs. Papp will be unable to collect
the death benefit.
An sMitopsy, held upon the body
Thursitey by Medical Examiner S. M.
Garlick, disclosed the cause of death
to be gunshot wounds inflicted yestsr-.
day. ,
Coroner John J. Phelan will hold a
continued hearing in the case on Sat
urday morning in the county court
house and much interest is displayed
in police circles as to what statements
will be made by the prisoner, who has
asserted that in spite of her counsel's
injunctions not to talk she will tell
her version of the shooting . and- its
cause. '
No one has attempted to visit or

was the woman. With a baby in her arms she had been hur
rying to get her husband's dinner, poured kerosene 01 kind
ling in the kitchen stove and ignited it. In the explosion she
nearly lost her life, and if either lives, it will be because of
the heroic efforts of passersby to save them. ,
It was shortly after 12 o'clock wjien
the explosion occurred. Nobody but
herself was on the lower floor of the
building. When the flames enveloped
their bodies, and began to sear their
flesh, she rushed about in a frenzy,
finally running from the house. ' , ,

screaming, until James Tirreli, fa. bar
