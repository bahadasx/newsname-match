Oneill ContmuesHis Campaign
of Mud Slinging Dirty Politics
The following Is a verbatim report
of one of the epeecbe of C. M. Oneill,
who with Prosecuting Attorney John
Irwin, is making a mud-alinging cam
paign throughout Klamath county, in
the hope of gaining favor from "the
voters. In the light of what is shown
oy the court' records, and what la
vouched for by other attorneys, It ap
pears singular that a man, seeking as
high and as dignified a position as
circuit Judge from the people, should
stoop to such muckraking practices
in the hope of gaining votes by seek
ing to besmirch Judgo Kuykendall.
The speech follews:
I would like to say to all you people
here that I am obliged to you for com
ing out to bear what I have to say and.
in connection with Mr. Irwin, we would
like to thank the directors who presid
ed over this school, for providing
means for permitting ea to have the
opportunity to meet and speak to yen
