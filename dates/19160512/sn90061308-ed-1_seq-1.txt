CARRANZA DELAYS
FINAL CONFERENCE
Obregon Reported to Be Seeking Par.
tial Withdrawal of Troops, but
, Scott Remains Steadfast
El Paso, Tex., May 10. Negotia
tions over American troop disposi
tions in Mexico made no" progress to
day. .
General Obregon awaited word
from General Carranza as to the
course he is now to pursue, and when
instructions did not come a' confer
ence which had been proposed for this
j - morning was postponed until tomor
row.
Failing in their efforts to have a
definite date of withdrawal set, it was
reported tonight that the . Mexican
overnment may next try to have part
of the American troops taken out at
once, leaving the remainder to co-op-:
erate with the forces of the de facto
government in the pursuit of Villa
groups. -
The report, which could not be con
firmed, had it that the Mexicans be
lieve the size of General Pershing's
army is out of all proportion to its
mission the extermination pf a few
hundred bandits and t that a much
smaller force .wimld answer the pur
pose. -A partial withdrawal, it is ar
gued, would have a good political in
fluence in Mexico.
If this plan were rejected, it was
indicated tonight, the Mexicans were
likely to decide further attempts to
alter the position of the United States
useless, and it was believed they then
will agree to the proposal of the
American government. '
