At Central City Hcfuwcs De
mands of Operators.
Central City, Ky., May 0. Dy a
voto of 39 to 2, delegates from the
forty-one local unions of District No.
'23,' United Mlneworkers of America,
decided to turn down an ultimatum
Issued to them by tho Western Ken
tucky Coal Operators' Association.
A- report will bo made to tho opera
tors In Louisville May 11, and unless
the operators yield C.000 union coal
Sunlners In Western Kentucky will bo
thrown out of employment.
The meeting of delegates hero to
day followed an open convention at
which nctlon was decided on. If tho
operators' association refuses to re
new the present wago Bcalo and pres
ent working conditions, miners will
attempt to make agreements with In
dividual operators, whether members
or the association or not. Tho miners
say they will also continue to report
for work at all mines and compel the
operators to tako Initiative In stop
ping work.
New York Scale Urged.
Seventeen of tho delegates present
stood out for demanding tho Now
York scale, which would mean nn
Incrcaso of C per cent., but a major
ity voted to hold out only for the
present scalo on account of compet
ing nonunion counties In Western
Kentucky.
Tho lockout which tho operators
say will como will affect Muhlen
berg, Ohio, Daviess, Union, Hender
son, Webster nnd McLean counties
principally.
The conference of the miners was
railed to order In tho Glsh opera
house at 10:30 o'clock. President
Pollock Introduced W. O. Smith,
chairman of tho Scale- Committee,
who reviewed tho Joint conferences
of March 21, April 4 and April 25.
He then read tho ultimatum of tho
operators, offering tho old wago
scalo but entailing conditions which,
ho said, amounted to a reduction. Ho
asked that tho committee bo author
ized to demand tho old wage scale
and the old working conditions.
Federation Against Strike.
John L. Lewis, of Springfield, 111.,
representing tho American Federa
tion of Labor, and Adam Wilkinson,
of Montana, a National Executive
f Doard member of tho United Mlno
workers, asserted that the treasury
of tho national organization had been
doplcted by strikes, In West Virginia,
Vancouver Island, , Colorado and
Eastern Ohio. Both men advised
against a strlko In Western Ken
tucky, provided present conditions
may be maintained. However, they
urged the miners to stand on their
present wage3 and working condi
tions with assurances of nld If need
ed. President Pollock, or District No.
23, stated that ho did not concur In
the recommendations or tho Scalo
Committee that andthor Joint con
ference bo held In Loulsvlllo May 11.
He said that ho had conferred with
Western Kentucky operators and
lenow that employes of 1,000 miners
would sign tho old contract imme
diately. Ho believed that operators
employing 2,500 men would sign up
within a week. Ho advised that fur
ther negotiations with tho Western
Kentucky Coal Operators' Associa
tion bo dropped, nnd thoso opera
tors who would agree to tho old scalo
bo signed up at onco.
W. D. Duncan, vlco preshlent of
District No. 23, disagreed with Mr.
Pollock on breaking off negotiations.
Ho asked tho convention to empower
its commltteo to turn down tho op
orators' ultimatum, but to meet tho
operators May 11 in Loulsvlllo for a
final conference Bhould that fall,
lie advised making contracts with In
dependent operators.

serious situation confronting them In
regard to the sale of tickets. The
seats have been placed on sale at $50
each and the demand has far exceed
ed the available supply and It has
been suggested that It will be neces
sary to raise tho price to $100 or pos
sibly higher In order to stop the
rush for reservations. The commit
tee has been allotted 2,200 tickets,
which, at $50 a ticket, would be
more than enough to meot tho $100,

BOY GUARDS BORDER
CAPTAIN PERRY KEOWN ORDER-
ED OUT WITH NEW MEXICO
NATIONAL GUARD
The following -is taken rrom the'
Clovls (New Mexico) Journal. The
Capt. Keown spoken of Is a former
Ohio county boy, the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Cal P. Keown, of Hartford. The
ja'"
jew Mexico Mtlltla was ordered out
is supposed that Captain Keown and
his company are now guarding the
Mexican border:
"Capt. Keown of the local company
K of the New Mexico National
Guard, has received Information, it
is understood, trom official sources
to the effect that his company may
momentarily expect orders to entrain
for border service, which report has
called for prompt preparation on the
part of the boys .or -the local' compa
ny, who have donned the khaki and
are drilling earnestly tor the emer
gency. " The local company Is com
posed entirely or white boys which
fact has led to the belief that should
any ot the companies ot tho Nation
al Guard of the state be called for
border service that Company K
would be ampng the first called up
on. Many lnllstments have been
made within the past two -days,
bringing the number In the company
up considerably, and creating a live

$85,000,000 FOR
ROAD BUILDING
SENATE PASSES FEDERAL ATD
BILL TO ASSIST STATES IN
HIGHWAY BUILDING.
$1,510,000 FORKENTUCKY"
Will Bo Great Help to niue Gra
State Provided' She Puts Up
Like Amount.
Washington, May 8. Under the
terms of the revised bill, providing"
for Federal aid In the construction of"
rural post roads, that passed the Sen
ate today, Kentucky will receive a
generous amount during the each of
the Ave years for which the approp
riation Is carried.
Or the $5,000,000 to be expended
by the Federal Government during
tho next fiscal year, for road Improve
ment work In the several states, Ken
tucky's share is $100,000. During"
the second year when $10,000,000 la
to be spent, the State's apportion
ment Is $201,200; during the third
year, tho State Is scheduled to re
ceive $301,800 of the $15,000,000 to
be expended; during the fourth year
$402,400 Is Kentucky's share of the
$20,000,000 and for the fiscal year '
ending June 30, 1921, when $25,
000,000 Is to be spent the State Is to
receive $503,000 for .road building
purposes. ,
Kentucky's Share. -sA
The apportionment to Kentucky
and her sister States Is made on the
bases of area, population, and tho
mileage or rural delivery and star
routes. Kentucky embraces 40,181
square miles; her population Is said
to be 2,289,905 and she has 20,769.
94 miles ot rurai delivery and star
routes. As a result, the State .is
scheduled to receive 2.012 per cent,
of the Federal app6rt!onment; pro-
vlded, ot course, she compiles with
the provisions of the proposed law.
Credit Plan Defeated.
The bill, known as the Bankhead ,
Good Roads Bill, was passed without
a record vote. It provides $85,000,
000 In construction of post roads,
contingent upon an equal expendi
ture by-the States. A fight, led by"
Senator Smoot, of .Utah, 40 extend
the credit of the United States to the
States for construction of roads was
tost 47 to 20.
The bill appropriates $5,000,000
for the year ending June 30, 1917,
with Increasing appropriations until
1921 when the entire amount is to
have been spent. The money Is to be
apportioned by the Secretary of Ag
riculture, according to tho terms of
the bill.
Senator Nelson, of Minnesota, and
Senator LlppUt,- of Rhode Island,
clashed in the closing moments of the
debate after the Rhode Island Sen
ator had Introduced a taUe showing
that three Eastern States, New York,
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania,
would contribute through their taxes
more than one-half of the entire re
venue appropriated for roads.
West Enriching East.
"I have heard so often that cer
tain States pay more than their share
of tho Income tax, that I am getting
tired of that," Senator Nelson stated.
"Tho Eastern Stntes aro able to pile
up tho great fortunes because they"
draw on tho Western country for it.
They havo not got this money from
Europe, but from us consumers in
the West, and I am getting tired of
their objecting to pay back a small
portion of It to the people of tho
West."
The measure Is a substitute for the
Shackloford bill, which passed tho
House, providing that not more than
$25,000,000 should be appropriated
annually by the Federal Government.
