The Sidney License Fight.
W. P. Miles, J. L Mcintosh and sev
eral other Sidney residents came down
yestorday for tho purpose of apply
ing to Judge Grimes for a writ of
mandamus to compel tho city council
of that town to make a re-canvass of
tho vote cast on tho wet and dry prop
osition nt the election last' month.
Judge 'Grfmes had been holding court
at Tryon and did not reach homo until
lato yesterday afternoon., The case
will bo argued before tho Judge this
forenoon.
Tho Controversy arises over tho fact
that in one of tho SIdnqy wards the
vote was eighty for no license
and seventy against. Ono of
tho clerks, however, tallied but seventy-nine
dry votes, which made tho
vote in tho entire city a tie. In can
vassing the vote the city council
found a discrepancy in the count and
declared tho vote a tic. The suit be
fore Judge Grimes is for a mandamus
requiring the city council to re-canvass
the vote.

fled them that brck paving is proving
tho most satisfactory in nil tho towns
