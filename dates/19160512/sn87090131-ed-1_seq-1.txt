Permanent Features of
the Road Bed
Foundations. Drainage and Grading
a PermaAent Investment
(Prepared by tne U. S. Department of Agrculture)
l -h
Rolling Shell Road, New Orleane.
In expending money raised by the
sale of highway bonds, highway com
missioners should distinguish care
fully between the permanent and the
perishable features of the road.
Foundations, drainage structures,
alignment and grades are in general
fairly permanent taeatures which
should be looked upon in the light of
an investment. If these features do
not comply with a certain standard,
it will be poor economy to spend mon
ey on transitory improvements such
as hard surfaces, which must, at con
siderable expense, be renewed from
year to year. In the same way, it is
manifestly poor policy to build an ex
pensive surface on defective grades
with poor alignments and short-lived
drainage features.
Even when much of the money ex
pended upon a highway has gone into
the permanent features, there is still
danger that the cost of repairs and
maintenance will be overlooked, or at
least slighted, in the calculations of
:·.:::11i i k

the road builders. When roads are i
built with borrowed money it is, of
course, especially important to avoid
this error. On the other hand, how- 1
ever, it is not necessary to regard the
total cost of surfacing a road as a
temporary improvement. Much of the
surfacing may be classed as a perma
nent investment, for it is becoming
more and more common to have sur
faces built in two courses, the lower
of which is as much a permanent fea
ture of construction as the grading
itself. This is particularly true of
those types of road that are built with
concrete foundations for bituminous
macadam, brick or asphalt surfaces.
It is probably conservative to regard
40 per cent of the first-construction
cost of macadam or more enduring
pavements as a permanent investment.
It is seldom nowadays that hard roads
are permitted to wear into the founda
tion course of the surfacing.
Where proper maintenance is as
sured it is safe to say that an average
r

of about 62 per cent of the total cost
of a well-built macadam road may be
considered as spent for permanent feea
tures, and with bituminous macadam
roads, about 66 per cent. This method
of estimating cannot be applied to any
gravel or natural soil road in which
no part of the surfacing can advanta
geously be considered permanent, for
under most systems of maintenance it
steadily deteriorates.
Roads built with surfaces entirely
of concrete, or with brick pavements
resting on a concrete foundation, are
sometimes regarded as permanent, but
this is hardly safe. It is not yet defi
nitely known how long the best con
crete surface will last. The best vitri
fied brick surfaces may last a number
of years, but even with them repairs
will be required.
It should be borne in mind by those
charged with the expenditure of high
way funds that the initial cost of a
road is never the final one; that no
surface is permanent, and that repairs
and maintenance-charges will always
be necessary. On the other hand.
many features of a good road are to
be regarded as permanent investments.
When roads are built with borrowed
money, the distinction between the
permanent and the'temporary improve.
ment must be carefully observed in
order that the county may have some
thing in exchange when the time
comes to repay the loan.
A Few Ways of Saving Money.
Saving money by not spending it for
good roads is like saving it in refusing
to improve stock.
It is like saving it by refusing to
build a modern barn.
It is like saving money by doing
without a silo.
It is like saving money by using ma
chinery beyond its period of useful
ness.
It is like saving money by paying
it to the doctors instead of caring
for the health of the family.
