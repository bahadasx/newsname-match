FTMDAY MAY 6 1916
Mr Bryan estimates that he has
traveled 500000 miles and the De
troit Free Press Is moved to remark
that Its too ibad It wasnt all In one
direction
Judications are that present unrest
in labor circles will continue for sev
eral months And that means great
loss to both employer and employee
It Is not hard to guess which will be
best able to stand the loss
This Is a day not only of business
mergers tout churches as well In the
little itown of Cimarron Kan tho
Methodists and Presbyterians have
agreed to worship In the same church
and help support the same minister
Ono or the churchcB will be abandon
ed and an effort made to build up one
strong and influential membership
Senator Atlee Pomerene will be
In Cleveland on Saturday May 6
where he delivers an address on the
theme These Neutral United States
before the City Club Inasmuch as
the Senator Is generally recognized
as beine close to tho President
considerable interest attaches to this
address The City Club is
ical
With the growing conviction that
President Wilson cannot possibly be
defeated for re election endeared as
he is In the hearts of all regardless
of politics there is a noticeable loss
of enthusiasm on the part of aspir
ants for the Republican senatorial
nomination In Ohio They know that
Senator Pomerene has stood with
President Wilson In all things and
that the Increasing regard for the ad
ministration leaves them scant hope
Newspaper publishers throughout
the United States are alarmed over
the condlton of the pnlnt paper market
Prices have advanced sharply during
the past few months and the output
of mills does not equal the demand
One of tho reasons for tho shortage
is due to the fact that the European
war has diverted from England and
Scandinavia many South American
publishers who are now buying paper
in the American market It Is just
possible that some nublishcrs will be
compelled to use one side of walh
paper as was tho caso during the civ
il war in order to keep their papers
going

One of the gas engines at the electric
light plant broke squarely in two

YOUNGSTOWN
May 4 The chief topic here now as
in many another city of tho U S Is
the labor one tho employers and the
employes being very much at var
iance so much so that Mayor Cunning
ham of Bast Youngstorwn and Mayor
Sitroll Thornton here have sworn In
a lot of special officers to keep the
ptnee or avert any outbreak such as
recently wrought such ruin and blood
ship In Mayor Cunninghams munic
ipality Perhaps without exception
the employers of tho large steel and
other btg concerns have rofused and
say they will continue to refuse the
demands of the union workmen the
demands made in many instances aft
er the men had had their wages ad
vanced from 10 to 15 per cent Even
tho natty and affablo young men
who serve behind the bars of the
city have been given an Increase of
10 per cent which must bring their
wages up to or about 20 a week
That is almost as much as made by
some able editors and with little or
no wear and tear of Intellect either
How determined tho men are Is In
dicated In the attitude of tne great
national labor leader Frank iMorrison
secretory or the American Federation
of Labor who lectured here or rath
er dncidentalyly made a democratic
speech Before he left for Washing
ton he said ho would send a dozen or
so expert labor advocates to sustain
the local men He also said he believed
the local situation Hkoly to become
serious Mow the employers fee and
stand is seen not only In their let
ters or proclamations to tholr work
men but in full page advertisements
in the dally press In one of these
arc the plain statements
To Whom It May Concern
The manufacturers of the Mahoning
vaney upon wnom tne demands ap
pearing below have been served wlBh
to publish for the Information of the
people of this valley a copy of the de
mands which have been made by the
local Union of Machinists and by oth
er labor unions of various crafts
We the members of Local 200 In
ternational Association of Machinists
take this means of placing before y5u
desired changes of conditions In your
plant Tne changes of conditions are
as follows
Eight hours to constltue a days
work without any reduotion in pay
per aay
A minimum rate of fifty cents an
hour be established Jor machinists
Overtime shall not be compulsory
All overtime to be paid for at the
rate of time and one half and double
time for Sundays and holidays The
holidays to be New Years day Wash
ingtons birthday Decoration day
Fourth of July Labor day Thanksglv
ing and Christmas
All machinists drillpress hands
special machine hands and floor and
vice men must be members of tho In
ternational Association of Machinists
Should it become necessary to re
duce forces the present men shall be
retained and reduction made In work
ing hours until hours have reached
thlnty two per week Should any
further reduction become necessary
the forces shall be reduced and tho
last man employed shall be the first
laid off ILaid off men shall be given
preference of re employment senior
ity to prevail
The ratio of apprentices to be not
more than one to each shop and one
to ten machinists thereafter
The term of apprenticeship to be four
years Apprentices cannot begin their
apprenticeship before the age of six
teen years and after the age of twen
ty one years
These chances of conditions to
take effect May 1 191C If either of
tne parties interested desires n
change of these conditions they must
give the other uarty at least thirtv
ilnva nntlna
The employers joplylng declare in
brief they cannot comply with the re
quests for one reason or account of
outside competition that local wages
are higher than in any other city in
the state that they believe In equal
treatment for all worklngmen wheth
er organized or not that every man
in America has the right to work Wth
out being compelled to Join any un
ion or organization ithat it is is im
possible to grant the demands print
ed above
That is not only the attitude of the
leading employers of Inbor here but
it is practically that that is seen to
obtain or being endorsed by manu
facturers and other employers In
many the most of the cities In the
Union It looks to many like the war
in Europe a fight to the finish or tho
death
