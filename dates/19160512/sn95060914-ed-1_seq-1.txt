TWENTY SECOND YEAR
PROHIBITION IS A
SUCCESS IN STM
President Andrew Kimball
Delivers Prohibition Ad
dress in Salt Lake
ARIZONA 18 MORE PROSPEROUS
Under Prohibition Than Under
the Old Conditions of the
Open Saloon
Press Report
Mr Kimball of Arizona dwelt
wholly on the success of prohibition
in Arizona
He said he had been in the thick
of the fight to obtain it and had
watched with pleasure the success
it had attained He then cited n
number of statistics to show how
beneficial prohibition had been to
the State at large
Efficiency of Labor
In the matter of efficiency of la
bor throughout the State there had
been a saving in time of 25 per
cent while at the Copper Queen
the largest works in the State there
was over 31 per cent With a pay
roll among the various works in the
State in six months of 400000 25
per cent would be a saving of 1
000000 on the average of 25 per
cent while with the larger com
panies a greater savings was real
ized
This was due to the fact that
whereas before prohibition 84 per
cent of the employes only reported
for work for two or three days
after pay day on account of drunk
enness since prohibition 98 per
cent report for work and all hands
are in better condition for duty
Increase in School Attendance
Attendance of public schools had
greatly increased and at the
versity -an increase of fully 50 per
cent Boys who were kept out of
school before the saloons were
closed now crowd the school room
as before prohibition drunkenness
disabled the head of the family
now the father can support his wife
and children and give the boys a
coveted opportunity of schooling
Drunkenness Decreased
Drunkenness had decreased at the
end of six months 85 percent there
being 2880 fewer arrests for drunk
ness in the State during that time
Local Option Not Enough
Local option while a step in the
right direction and is better than
the open saloon is not enough We
need State wide prohibition
Four counties principally those
occupied by the Mormon people
were mostly dry through local op
tion where splendid results were
obtained but liquor was had from
the wet towns and counties and
therefore kept up a continuous
strife
Taxes Reduced
Taxes were reduced and condi
tions were greatly improved but it
was not permanent as is now shown
under State wide prohibition
Franchise of Women
The enfranchisement of women
had to do with our success We
gave women their franchise and
through the initiative and referen
dum they voted the State dry
Revenue Losses Made Up
Kevenue losses occasioned by clos
ing the saloons were more than
made up by increased taxable prop
erty
Deposits Increased
Deposits iucreased whereas Le
fore prohibition the wage earners
especially in the mining camps de
posited their wages in the saloon
now he pays his obligations and
puts some of his earnings either in
the postal savings or the banks of
the State
In six months the postal savings
increased 587252 and in the banks
3000000
Better Manhood
Wage earners are paying their
obligations and where before pro
hibition their wages were squan
dered in drink and in gambling now
their families are provided with the
comforts of life their children in
school and still better than that be-
sides their other savings they are
becoming interested in the various
enterprises of the State
Better Civilization
Where the tmloon menaced the
civilisation the upaue then occu i
pled by tho saloon Is progressive
taxable property Stores drug
stores restaurants dairy lunph
moving picture shows and a nun
dred more good features of civili
zation mark the places formerly oc
cupied bV saloons each built up by
Gila Alumni
Enjoys Banquet
The annual Alumni social and
banquet of the Gila Academy
was held Monday night May 8th
in the Amusement Hall Thatch 1
er and was a decided success
socially and financially
In order that the graduating
class of twenty two members
could enjoy the program and
banquet they were first initiated
in the degree of membership
They were dressed in grotesque
style had their faces blacked and
were then blindfolded and put in
a boat which was drawn up an
incline ten feet then slid down
the incline and the blind folds
taken off The new members
were then introduced and sang
the new school song
Miss Rosalind Wixom read an
excellent Alumni poem and Pro
fessor Payne sang a solo after
which everybody shook hands and
tnen repaired to me itenei society
Hall where they enjoyed the
banquet and the many appropri
ate toasts
The election for officers for
next year resulted as follows
President Mrs Ezra Curtis
Vice President Miss Annie Nash
Secretary Ray Killian Execu
tive Committee Myron Allred
chairman and Miss Jessie Ells
worth and Dewey Bryce mem
bers
The Alumni went on record for
the building of a 10000 gym
nasium for the school
Banquet broke up about mid
night and was voted the best and
most successful Alumni gathering
that has ever been held
the patronage of the sober clas3 of
wage earners
Loss of Revenue No Longer
a Bugaboo
Taxes decrease There has been
a decrease or irom ia to 202 in
taxes in the two counties absolutely
dry under local option which have
been dry long enough to make an
appreciable difference so that the
calamity howling saloon keeper can
no longer work his los3 of revenue
stunt We have proven beyond
question by figures that property
interests have so far outdone liquor
revenues in general increase- that
the Royal Arch has no founda
tion longer upon which to stand
Moral Sidp Conceded
The moral side of this question
will not need to be touched upon
before this intelligent audience I
am sure none will question for it is
conceded long since that conditions
are better morally wherever dry
conditions prevail
444 Saloons Closed
As yet the State has not been en
tirely dry Uefore the 444 saloons
were closed December 31 1914 at
12 oclock at night many citizens
laid in a supply and much liquor
was stored by the saloon keepers
Notwithstanding all this liquor still
in the State and more smuggled in
by bootleggers conditions have im
proved several hundred per cent
Less Crime Committed
In the counties there has been a
falling off of 3303 per cent and in
the cities 50 per cent Ies3 Drunk
enness has decreased 85 per cent
in six months 2290 less arrests for
drunkenness at an approximate
cost of 1250 per drunk has saved
the taxpayers a mint of money
Then there lias been a reduction in
the force of peace officers savings
in prison feed and incidental ex
penses following drunkenness and
a corresponding savings through
better citizenship where before the
saloons closed the unfortunate vic
tims were dealing misery to their
families now we have progressive
happy homes and the same citizens
are helping to maintain a prosper
ous commonwealth
Save in Cost of Government
In Phoenix our capital city there
were 1125 less arrests in six months
with the reduction of police force
and general expenses incident to
taking care of the drunks has saved
the city government in that time
over 20000 In Tucson the next
largest city there has been a sav
ing of at least 3000 in six months
with 255 less arrests for drunken
ness and so we might go over the
State from city to city and from
town to town approximating the
savings and counting the benefits
until it would run up into the mil
lions and this while apparent to
all by way of financial savings is
not to be compared with the better
citizenship better moral conditions
and good results to society in gen
eral
Saloon Not to Recur in Arizona
There will be no recurrence of
the saloon in Arizona Men who
voted wet before would vote dry
should the occasion require it The
sontlment runs high for a continua
tion of dry conditions and Arizona
has by her action on the liquor
question placed herself in the fore
most ranks of the most progressive
states in the Union
