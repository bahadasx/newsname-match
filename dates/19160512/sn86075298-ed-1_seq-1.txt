BRIEF NOTE
TO BERLIN
Washington, May 9.-President Wil.
son has put Germany on trial.
In the text of the American reply
to the most recent German note on
subsea warfare the imperial govern
ment is told the United States relies
upon Germany to keep its promises to
alter the methods of submarine war
fare.
Scrupulous execution of its changed
policy, the note says, will remove the
danger of an interruption of the good
relations existing between Germany
and the United States.
At the same time the note rejects
the proposal that the - United States
regard this abandonment as condition
al upon Great Britain's action with
respect to the blockade.
The note is courteous in tone, but
firm and definite in substance.
It is intended to remove all doubt
of the imperial government as to the
position the United States has taken.
Secretary of State Lansing issued
the following statement explaining
why the United States. cannot dis
cuss matters pertaining to the rela
tions between this government and
Great Britain with the imperial gov
ernment.
Lansing Explains Position.
"The greater part of the German
answer is devoted to matters which
this government cannot discuss with
the German government.
"The only questions of right which
can be discussed with that govern
Slnent are those arising out of its ac
\tion or out of our own and in no event
those questions which are the subject
o-f diplomatic exchanges between the
United States and any other country.
"The essence of the answer is that
Germany yields to our representations
with regard to the rights of merchant
ships and noncombatants on the high
seas and engages to observe the rec
.ognized rules of international law gov.
iening naval warfare in hsing her sub
marines against merchant ships.
"So long as she lives up to this al
tered policy we can have no reason to
quarrel with her on that score, though
the losses resulting from the violation
of American rights by German sub
marine commanders operating under
the former policy will have to be set
tled.
Treaty Covers British Case.
"While our differences with Great
Britain cannot form a subject of dis
cussion, with Germany it should be
stated that in our dealings with the
British government we are acting as
we are unquestionably bound to act in
view of the explicit treaty engage
ments with that government.
"We have treaty obligations as to
the manner in which matters in dis
pute between the two governments
are to be handled.
"\We offered to assume mutually
similar obligations with Germany, but
the offer was declined.
"When, however, the subject in dis
pute is a continuing menace to Amer
ican lives it is doubtful whether such
obligations apply unless the menace is
removed during the pendency of the
proceedings."
Secretary Lansing's statement re
fers for the first time in the subma
rine negotiations to the "Bryan peace
treaties."
Following is the text of the note
cabled by Secretary Lansing to Am
bassador Gerard at Berlin with in
structions to deliver it to the German
minister of foreign affairs:
Complete Text of Note.
"The note of the imperial German
government under date of May 4, 1916,
has re'e-ived careful consideration by
the government of the United States.
"It is especially noted as indicating
the purpose of the imperial govern
ment as to the future, that it 'is pre
pared to do its utmost to confine the
operation of the war for the rest of
its duration to the fighting forces of
the belligerents,' and that it is de
termined to impose upon all its com
manders at sea the limitations of the
recognized rules of international law
upon which the government of the
United States has insisted.
"Throughout the months which have
elapsed since the imperial government
announced on Feb. 4, 1915, its subma.
rine policy, now happily abandoned,
the government of the United States
has been constantly guided and re
strained by motives of friendship in
its patient efforts to bring to an amic
able settlement the critical questions
arising from that policy.
Plaees Reliance in Germany.
"Accepting the imperial govern.
ment's declaration of its abandonment
of the policy which has so seriously
menaced the good relations between
the two countries the government of
the United States will rely upon a
scrupulous execution henceforth of the
now altered policy of the imperial
government such as will remove the
principal dairger to an interruption of
the good relations existing between
the United States and Germany.
"The government of the United
States feels it necessary to state that
it takes it for grhnted that the impe
rial German government does not in
tend to imply that the maintenance of
its newly announced policy is in any
way contingent upon the course or re
sult of diplomatic negotiations be
tween the government of the United
States and any other belligerent gov
ernment, notwithstanding the fact
that certain passages in the imperial
government's note of the fourth ih
stant might appear to be susceptible
of that construction.
"In order, however, to avoid any
possible misunderstanding the govern
ment of .the United States notifies the
imperial government that it cannot
for a moment entertain, much less dis
cuss, a suggestion that respect by
German naval authorities for the
rights of citizens of the United States
upon the high seas should in any way
or in the slightest degree be made con
tingent upon the conduct of any other
government affecting the rights of neu
trals and noncombatants.
"Responsibility in such matters is
single, not joint; absolute, not rela
tive."
RONAN 6,
SOMERS 3.
The Ronan team went up to Somers
last Sunday and played a fast game
with the team in the saw mill town on
the lake. That it was a fast game
from start to finish is clear to all who
observe the box score printed below, as
there was no time during the entire
game when it was not either side's
game. A bobble by the Ronan boys
would have cost them the game but
luckily that catastrophe never happened.
Manager Carper worked hard last
week after matching the game and se
cured an excursion rate for all who
wished to go and had a boat chartered
to convey the players and fans from
here, and a goodly number-between
40 and 50-took advantage of the
chance and went along.
The trip across the lake was rather
rough as there was a strong wind blow
ing and the boat pitched more than
some say was enjoyable. Not nearly
so many were sick going as coming
back, however.
Joe White pitched a remarkable game
for so early in the season and has 17
strike-outs to his credit. Every man
made a hit-either in the game or com
ing or going-including the manager
and score keeper.
The box score shows, by innings:
Ronan -3 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0--- 6
Somers-1 02000000 -3
Umpire, Russel, of Big Arm; score
keeper, Lloyd Wallace.
A return game has been arranged for
May 21st at Ronan, and another good
game may be expected.
The Ronan players were Darnell, 1st
base, White pitcher, Kopal shortstop,
Turnquist catcher, Bergevin center
field, Jacobs 3rd base, McLaughlin
right field, Wagner 2nd base, and
Garipy left field.
Tie Somers players were Smith, P.
Torburgson, Bassford, Henry, Moore,
Larson, Hoppe, Schlegel and A. Tor
burgson.
SOME TIMBERED LANDS
SUBJECT TO ENTRY
F. J. White received a letter this
week from Senator Myers in which, in
part, he said:
"My bill to allow homestead entries
on timbered lands in the Flathead,
where the lands are as valuable for
agriculture as for timber, has been in
corporated in the Indian appropriation
bill and has passed the house and sen
ate and will become a law."
This bill will allow many more entries
to be made in this vicinity, as much of
the so-called timber land is not so val
uable for timber as for agriculture.
Senator Myers also writes:
"The house and senate conferees
have agreed to $750,000 for the Flat
head project. The report has been pre
sented to the house and senate and will
be adopted by the senate and will be
acted on soon, I think. I am sure it
will be adopted by the senate and have
strong hopes that it will be adopted by
the house. If so, the project will get
I that amount. "
MILWAUKEE EXPERT WILL
MAKE TONNAGE ESTIMATE
The electric railroad committee,
composed of representatives from
Poison, Ronan, St. Ignatius and
Missoula, have secured the ser
vices of Mr. R. F. Weeks, division
freight and passenger agent of
the Milwaukee railroad, to make
an expert examination and re
port as to the tonnage to and
from the Flathead. Mr. Weeks
has made every preliminary in
spection and report on every ex
tension which the Milwaukee has
constructed and is undoubtedly
a high class man. The commit
tee is very fortunate in securing
so valuable a man to make this
examination and his report will
be awaited with much interest.
Mr. Weeks will not be able to
leave Seattle, his headquarters,
before ths 20th inst., but expects
to commence his inspection im
mediately thereafter.
There is another and greater
significance attached to Mr.
Weeks' employment, and that is
the fact that he is connected
with the Milwaukee railroad. It
TO REPEAT STAMPEDE
IN MISSOULA THIS YEAR
Announcement comes from Missoula
that the Stampede is to be repeated
this year. The show given last year
was in every way first class and assur
ances have been given that it will be
even better this season. The dates for
the Stampede are July 1, 2, 3 and 4.
The prize lists have been issued and
show a substantial increase over the
very liberal purses hung up for last
year's events Contestants are already
sending in their entries and the field
will be the largest which has ever ap
peared in a wild west competitive show
in Montana. Among these entries are
some of the brightest stats in their re
spective lines.
Special attention is to be given the
relay and pony express races which
attracted so much favorable comment
last year. The purses for these events
are to be materially increased and the
best strings in the northwest will be
seeh on the track at the coming show.
The general entertainment offered the
visitors this year will be in every way
pleasing and the record of 1915 will un
doubtedly be broken. Special rates
are to be granted by the railroads and
these will be announced within a short
time.
School Notes
The girls of the Foods class served a
delicious four course dinner to the high
school boys Monday afternoon at three
o'clock.
The district athletes go to Poison
Monday, May 15, for the annual Polson
District meet. We are in hopes that
many of the Ronan rooters will be
present to witness the events, as this
will be one of the best meets ever held
on the reservation.
Next week the eighth grade and
high school will take their final exam
inations. Because the high schools of
district 28 are accredited, the eighth
grades will not take the state exams,
but will take those given by the dis
trict.
Tom Bailey is the only one from the
second grade who gets a certificate for
perfect attendance.
Catherine Hay, Chester Hardman,
George McCormick and Mary Hay
will receive certificates for perfect at
tendance in the third grade.
Round Butte
Rev. Tester will preach at the Round
Butte church on Sunday, May 21, at
2 o'clock.
The Round Butte Ladies' Aid will
meet with Mrs. Eaal Spencer on Wed
nesday, May 17. All are welcome.
would appear that the Milwaukee
must be interested in the data to
de secured else it would not have
been possible to secure his ser
vices.
The Pioneer is informed that
the only charge Mr. Weeks will
make for this work is his trans
portation, meals, stenographic
service and incidentals.
In this counection it may be
said that although the N. P.
surveyors have been in this sec
tion for several weeks, that fact
will not be allowed to dismay nor
discourage the promoters of the
electric line fram Polson to Mis
soula, via Ronan and St. Igna
tius. There are so many who
are squeamish about the good
faith of the N. P. and they do
not propose to allow a bluff to
work this time. Besides, those
who have investigated the field
say there is every reason to be
lieve that even if the N. P. does
"come across" and build, that
the electric line would still be a
paying investment. Two roads
would not injure the Flathead.
ANNUAL INTER-SCHOOL
AND COMMUNITY FESTIVAL
The District Festival this year will
be held at Ronan, May 19th,. Without
doubt it will be the best and largest
ever held in this district. There were
present at least six hundred people at
the recent Field meet at Leon. This
is evidence of a degree of interest
which will assure the presence of at
least 1200 at the big event. Since most
of the athletic events have been held
there will be time on the 19th for a
program especially adapted to the in
terest of the "old folks" on the one
hand and to the enjoyment of the
small folk on the other.
The program will consist of graduat
ing exercises, addresses by well known
speakers of the state, spelling con
tests, exhibit contests, singing, games
and folk dances, high school athletics,
a banquet, and a reception and dancing.

RONAN TEACHERS ENJOY
LONG MOUNTAIN CLIMB
The Ronan teachers, Dr. Becker,
Miss Azelie Savage, Miss Barbara Kain,
Miss Irene Teargarden, Miss Hilda
Marsh and Peter Hanson, were guests
of Mrs. Louise Covalt and son, George,
at the latter's homestead northeast of
Ronan last Sunday. The guests were
treated to some of Mrs. Covalt's best
in the way of dinner and to a long
mountain climb which took them to
the lake at the head of Mud creek,
where there is said to be the finest
falls to he found in the Mission range.
The climb took them to the snow where
it is several feet deep at this time.
While the climb to reach the falls and
lake is difficult in many places, they
enjoyed the trip very much-at least
that is what they report.
Upon the return of the party to the
Covalt home they enjoyed another
hearty meal and arrived home about 9
o'clock very much pleased over the
day's journey and the scenery they had
seen.
LEON FIELD MEET
LAST SATURDAY
The annual field meet of District No.
28 was held at Leon last Saturday with
a good attendance. Only four of the
twelve schools entered for the events,
with Ronan and Leon the principal con
tenders for athletic honors.
Owing to the high wind which pre
vailed at the time some of the events
were to be run, an adjournment was
taken until May 19, at which time three
events will be finished. These are the
mile run, low hurdles and high hurdles.
It will require the totals of these three
events to determine which school is el-
titled to the championship, as the score
is subject to being materially altered
when all are finished.
According to the rule adopted to de
termine the championship, Ronan is
now ahead six and one-third points,
but this may be changed to the extent
of allowing Leon to win.
The events which were finished last
Saturday and the winners in each were
as follows:
50 yard dash-Allard, Leon, 1st;
Fisher, Ronan, 2nd; Boals, Arlee, 3rd:

names of contestants not given.
Declamation, junior-Alice Sheen,
Ronan, 1st; Anna Beckwith, St. Igna
tius, 2nd, Bruce B. Hall, North Moiese,
3rd.
In the athletic events first counted
5, second 3, and third 1; in the declam
atory contest first counted 8 points,
second 5, third 3. To find the total
score of any school divide the total
athletic score by 2 and add the total in
other events. Taking this as a basis
the different schools earned in total
points as follows:
Arlee 7 1-6, St. Ignatius 9 2-3, Leon
31 2-3. Ronan 38, North Moiese 3.
The Domestic Science department
of the school served an elegant lunch
during the day, and the day ended
with a big dance which was attended
by people from all parts of the district'
SCOTT PRESENTS
FRESH DEMANDS
Efforts to Effect an Understanding Re
garding the Status of American Sol
diers in Mexico Will Be Continued
at the Next Conference.
El1 Paso, Tex., May 9.-New de
mands were made on Mexico as a re
sult of the bandit raids in the Big.
Bend district.
The feeling is growing here that the
situation as affecting the United
States and Mexico has taken on new
gravity.
The conference between Generals
Scott and Funston and General Obre
gon, Mexican minister of war, and
Juan Amador, subsecretary of foreign
affairs, ended without an agreement
having been reached.
It was indicated, however, that ef
forts to effect an understanding re
garding the status of the American
troops in Mexico have not been aban
doned and that another conference
will be held.
Most of the conference had to do
with the raid and the steps to be tak
en to disperse bandit groups in North
ern Coahuila.
Demands presented to the Mexican
representatives, it is said, included
the co-oAeration of the Mexican and
American troops in districts not
hitherto touched in the negotiations.
General Funiton refused to indi
cate whether a second expeditionary
force is to go into Mexico near Bo
quillas.
He said that circumstances made it
impossible for him to speak.
He was asked if a report from
Washington that troops may already
have crossed was true.
He replied that he believed they
had "not yet" gope over.
DECLARES ENGLAND
HAS AMERICAN CODE
New York, May 9.--"The British
government knew the contents" of
Germany's reply to the United States
at least twelve hours before the
American state department."
This charge is made here by an
eminent German, who is close to the
German embassy, who went even ftr
ther, saying:
"For many months Downing street,
which is in possession of the Ameri
can secret diplomatic code, has had
advance information as to the con
tents of every official and private
message exchanged between Berlin
and Washington.
"Ambassador Gerard in Berlin
knows this. Every attache at the
American embassy knows it, and the
German government knows it. More
over, it is moderately certain that the
American state department knows it,
for it received--not once, but repeat
bdly-communications from Ambassa
dor Gerard urgently requesting the
adoption of a new code."
District Court
Judge Theodore Lentz opened the
May term of district court in Missoula
Monday morning. called the calendar
and ordered the clerk to draw a jury
for the trial of cases. The jurors will
report for duty May 31st, at which
time the trial of cases will begin. The
following jurymen have been sum
moned for jury service from the reser
vation country:
Carl Hasms, Poison; Pete C. Boeth
ler, Horte; A. P. Morse, Robert Arm

Elks' State Convention
The Pioneer has received an invi
tation to attend the Elks' State con
vention to be held an Butte on July 1,
2r 3, 4 and 5. The convention this
year, as usual will be an attraction that
will attract many visitors to Butte and
a grand time is expected. Butte lodge
No. 240, is sending out the invitatioa.
Electric Railroad Meeting
Another meeting of those interested
in the building of an electric railroad
from Poison to Missoula is called to
meet in Ronan, on Friday, May 19, at
11 a. m., at Scearce's hall. Important
matters will come before the meeting,
C. F. RATHItONE, Chairman.
