JURY TO PROBE
Reports That 'Jesse Gray Case'
Only Began With Officer's
Dismissal
Well-defined reports are current
that the "Jesse Gray" case is only
beginning.
Gray's charge that Chang Chau, the
Wahiawa storekeeper, had "framed
him" tut of his iob as Wahlawa po
lice officer by gettfne Chinese gamb
lers to. swear he took hush-moneys is
expected to be probed bv the territo

On account of law of court funds the

uncertain. -,' ' "''- V-".Wi': ' -:-
Since Chang , Cbau :-acQuittat" la

the latter has been tahilunt over what
be says is his vindication. However,
Chang Chau's intervie- - published in
the Star-Bulletin in which he says
there was a "frame-up" against him,
and that things were running "wide
open" in Wahiawa, has opened an al
leged situation which the grand jur
ors are expected to probe.
Gray meanwhile declares his entire
Innocence and has witnesses, among
them several army officers, to testify
as to his integrity of character.
Gray is likely to demand the grand
jury investigation on his own account,
his friends say. They declare that a
thorough ventilation of the Wahiawa
situation will show that if any money
was being raised out there for police
protection, not all of It went to Gray.
