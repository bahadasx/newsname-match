WAS BURHEOTO DEATH
Mrs. A. G. Arrington Fire Victim
. Alone When Discovered
Almost Charred.
The community was shocked
to a stand still Tuesday morning
when word was quickly passed
that Mrs. A. G. Arnngton had
been burned practically to a
crisp by her clothing being set
on fire in some unexplained
manner while all but herself
were absent for a short time
from their home.
Her husband had left home
soon after breakfast to get some
garden tool, and about 8:30 or
8:45 her husband returned and
going around the house, heard
his wife call for Jesse, one cf
her granddaughters. He ans
wered her that she had gone to
school, he having passed the
two girls on the road near home.
She told him to come quick. He
went into the house and found
her standing in the doorway be
tween their sleeping room and
the kitchen, trying to wrap
sheet around her nude, charred
form. She told him to get the
soda and he, noticing that she
was smoked black from her
shoulders to her knees, looked
for the soda and found that it
had been dropped to the floor.
He got her on the bed and she
had him rmt more covering over
her and sprinkle her with soda,
He dusted soda all over her at
her direction and she talked to
him all the time saying that her
sleeve had caught on fire and
she could not put it out. He
said he would call a doctor and
she objected saying she would
be alright in a short time, but he
lost no further time phoning for
a physician who came in a few
minutes and applied what reme
dies he had with him and re
turning to a drug store for more,
brot another physician with him
and together they did all that
could be done for the alleviation
of the pain inevitable from
hard baked flesh all over her
body and limbs.
She must have been sitting by
the cook stove when her clothing
became ignited and suffering for
several days with a sort of verti
go at times, been unable at once
to extinguish the fire, she rushed
to a tub of water in the rear and
mauaged in some miraculous
manner considering her condi
tion, to get some relief. She
tore a small fragment of the
upper body and sleeve of her
close fitting under suit and a
small piece of the lower portion
of the suit from her shoulders
and ankles and rushed tor a
sheet to wrap about her and had
just got back into the house
when her husband came. Evi
dently she did not know just how
her clothing became ignited, but
repeated that her sleeve had
caught fire and she couldn't put
it out. She was so badly burned
that it was plain that all sense
of pain had been practically tak
en from her, tho she desired to
be turned from one side to the
other almost constantly.
At four o'clock Wednesday
morning she expired, the wonder
being that she could possibly
have survived so long.
Bettie, daughter of Robert and
Millicent Franklin, was born at
Concord Depot, Virginia, Jan. 7,
1843, and was united with Albert
G. Arrington, a soldier in Stone
wall Jackson's command, Nov
ember 22, 1865, and to the union
came Mrs. Wortie Hoel,. Mrs.
Jessie Shumaker, deceased, A.
F. Arrington and Mrs. Edmonia
M. Wells who resides in Califor
nia. In addition to these sur
vivors are her husband and 12

Jordan Takes The Cake
The closing exercises at Jor-
don school, west of this city call
ed together a larger assembly
than perhaps will be seen on
such an ocassion any where else
in the county. It was very un
usual and as much of a surprise
to the neighborhood and the
teachers as the visitors from a
distance. The house contained
fully 250 and there were many
. . it
more on tne outside wno couia
get no standing room.
Besides music there was a
good serio, comic play, Mrs.
Briggs of the Poultry Yard"
and the various parts in the
play were unusually well render
ed. It appeared to be the senti
ment of the audience outside as
well as -in, that Miss Jennie
Nolting, the old woman in the
play, was the star, while Miss
Zelma Billups in the character
of the adopted daughter acquitt
ed her self like an old timer on
the stage. Charlie Isle was the
funny man and sure enough
funny and Herbert Foster as
the punk daddy aroused some
suspicion for the future. Martin
Courtney as a widower took his
cue from the performances of
one near Brunswick and of
course brot down the house.
Denton Grotjan's selections
on the violin surprised all as
well as supplying a delightful
part of the entertainment.
Whatever may be pulled off
at Jordon in the future, last
Friday night will live in the
memory of all who attended as
being a great success.
Asbury Home-Coming
If you are now or ever have
been interested in Asbury
church, bring your lunch and
come prepared to stay all day,
Sunday, May 14.
There will be an all-day pro
gram of sermons, speeches and
music. The Dalton Orchestra
will furnish special music and
there will be many other num
bers on the program that will
make the day worth while. Sun
day school begins at ten o'clock.
We .hope to make this Asbury
Heme-coming an annual affair,
for we believe there is no church
in Chariton county that has more
friends than the one named for
our first Methodist bishop,
Francis Asbury.
Respectfully,
H. D. Marlin, Pastor.
Guilty Your Honor-$23.50
"What say you, guilty or not
guilty?"
"Guilty, your honor."
"$23.50 please. Next."
A short dialogue between the
mayor of Salisbury and a "few
callers," at his office Tuesday.
The "callers" to the number of
eleven, and there are a few to
call later, were charged with
rolling the bones or dealing the
cards, with a few pennies on the
side to make it interesting, how
ever, against the peace and
dignity of the city. According
ly Marshall Simmons escorted
the boys to the mayor's court,
where the above dialogue took
place. The city got $20 and the
officers split the $3.50. Press

EUROPEAN!! HEWS
Million Fighting at Verdun
Advantage Shifts Daily
U. Boats Active.
Renewed efforts by German
army to capture Verdun have
been partially successful tho the
taking of the principal hill has
been so far prevented by the
French. The war in the far
east is not so fierce since the
capture by Turks of an entire
British army, but the Dual Mon
archy and its allies are more
than holding their own every
where. Many ships have been
sunk in the past week tho the
number not nearly so great as
the week before. The Cymric
is the last victim of a German
torpedo, it is claimed, sunk with
a million dollars worth of muni
tions for allies. No Americans
aboard and claimed to have sunk
without warning. Austriansare
holding Italian army numerically
much stronger and half of the
French army, nearly eight hund
red thousand men. are defend
ing Verdun.
French loss by German artill
ery is said to be enormous. Re
bellion in Ireland about wiped
out, tho the nation is incensed
at the execution of leaders in
the rebellion against general
conscription.
MEXICO
More soldiers are being rushed
to the border and skirmishes be
tween U. S. . Soldiers and Mexi
cans occur every day. The situ
ation is such that President
Wilson is seriously considering
intervention. The concensus of
opinion favors immediate inter
vention and by the time we go
to press again, we may be full
tilt among Mexicans with the
determination to settle the ques- j
tion without further delay. ',

Gardner Extending Efforts
Col. Fred D. Gardner was in !
Washington City last week be- J

rural credit system for the
whole country and it is possi

be patterned after the Missouri
Land Bank Bill. Saturday Col.
Gardner had an interview with
President Wilson, who i3 heart

credit system. While certain
low browed politicians are fight

Land bank, (Jol. Gardner is1

Capt. Louis Benecke of Bruns

Monday of last week. There

SALISBURY BOY KILLED
Jumping on Train, Fell Under.
Both Legs are Cut off.
Two Others.
Horrible accident; Clarence
Richardson, son of Tom Richard
son, the shoe man, met a horri
ble death at Clifton Hill Friday
morning, while attempting to
board a moving freight train,
both of his legs being cut off,
and being otherwise injured,
death occurring a few hours
after being brought to this place
and after the amputation of his
limbs. He had spent the night
with a friend in or near Clifton,
and intended coming home on
the passenger that arrives here
at 6:38 a. m. but missing that
attempted to board a through
freight, with the result above
stated. Clarence wa3 a boy of
much promise, about 17 1-2
years old, and his untimely and
tragic death is greatly regretted
and his parents have the sympa
thy of a host of friends. We
tender our condolence to the
grief stricken parents and hope
the God of all grace will soften
the blow to them as time passes
on.
At Chillicoth2 Wednesday
another young man about the
age of Richardson, while jump
ing trains, met with exactly the
same kind of disaster, and also
another at Carrollton Saturday.

many friends here are hoping
for a speedy improvement in his
condition. Press Spectator.
Some Leading Country
Schools
In first one way and another we
managed to get some data con
cerning some of the country
schools which we give. It was
our purpose to get some statistics
from all the schools in the
county and publish them, but
the crowded condition of our
columns for week3 has been
such that we could not go strong.
The little data we have secur
ed is as follows:
Dist. 122-Mrs. Maude Forrest

attendance 23. Mrs. Forrest
employed to teach at Salisbury.
Miss Zudia Carlstead is her
successor.

enne win teach in Howard the

Ditch Navigable
Victor Grove of New Cambria
sold Mr. Swigart who owns the
Salisbury ranch north of that
city, 32000 pounds of drain tile
and delivered it on fiat boats at
the ranch Friday, having used
the Chariton ditch for water
way. The current in the ditch
is swift and the water deep, and
the trip was made in a hurry.
From any point ud the ditch,
shipping is good at present, the
water being deep enough to
float any ordinary scow no mat
ter how heavily loaded. Almost
anything could be transported to
points along the ditch or to the
Missouri river, and until the bars
and snags are removed from
that invaluable, if put in condi
tion, water way, would have to
stop there. Fix the Missouri
and Mississippi rivers, around
thru the Panama and Pacific.
Lawrence Sigloch has accept
ed a position with the Brummall
drug store in Salisbury,
The Mule Kicked
Walter R. Myers, youngest
son of Mr. and Mrs. John Mvers,
Sr., was painfully hurt last
Saturday afternoon, when he
was kicked in the face by a big
work mule. Walter wa3 shear
ing the animal, when it blazed
away in true mule fashion, the
blow striking Walter on the jaw,
cutting a considerable gash, a
making a very painful bruise.
He has been confined to his bed
since, and has been under the
care of a physician. We hope to
see him out soon. Brunswicker.
Geo. and S. J. Hall of Geneva,
Neb., and their wives are guests
for a few days of their sister,
Mrs. A. Schupback north of
town.
Government Gets Your Hands
Government through the U.
S. Department of Labor is help
ing to bring the jobless together
by means of distributing branch
es located widely throughout the
country. The work is of incal
culable benefit.
"The government inspector in
charge of these branches stand
ready at all times to help farm
ers and others in want of farm
help to get in touch with men
and women in search of farm
work, farms for rental, etc."
Earl Dempsey of Triplett was a
caller here Sunday.
High School Notes
Rev. Byerly addressed the
high school Friday.
Principal Cowles will go to
St. Louis the latter part of the
week.
Some anxiety i3 felt about the
grade cards which will be issued
soon. It is too late to feel con
cerned. Two of the athletes walked to
Jordon Friday night and most of
the way back. They dinn't have
to but-
Charles Bondurant and George
Hooper will leave Friday for
Columbia to take part in the
athletics.
Ten essays on Shakespeare
were sent to the English depart
ment of the Kirksville Normal
to be graded in the contest for
the medal and we hope to win.
A number of the freshmen
and sophs went to the commence
ment at Jordon Friday night and
on the way managed to get
stuck in the mudhole near the
Daily farm. Miss Ruth Gilbert
was chape'rone.
Eighth grade pupils from the
country will be welcomed next
fall and they should come to
this school rather than take the
ninth grade in the country for
the reason that they do not get
credit for the grade taken in the
country.
