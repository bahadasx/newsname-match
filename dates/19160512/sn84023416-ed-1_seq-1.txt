L. F.JONES. DRY
Island Pond, Vt, May 10, 1916
To the Citizens of Island Pond:
We desire to call attention to , the
letter on s"Clean-up Week" in last
week's Herald by Dr. Sargent,
health officer, and would respectful
ly urge every familv at once to
carry out its suggestions. For the
sake of health to see that all refuse
matter is destroyed or rem'oved, and
also anything unsightly that tends to
mar the natural beauty of our town.
We have a town site as beautiful by
nature as any in the state and far
surpassing most, it is surely beau
tiful for situation. Let us all try to
make it a joy to all who may visit us
this summer. A little work, a little
care on the part of all will do won
ders in removing and abolishing all
that is unhealthful and offensive to
the eye.t The Clean-up Committee
will be glad to render all assistance
in their power.
Yours for a cleaner, brighter town,
W. H. Kane.
Robert Gardiner,
J. R. Applebee,
F. E. Russell,
Robert Lawton,
Clean-up Committee.
The Clean-Up committee has been
busy the past few days cleaning up
and beautifying the village. A meet
ing of the committee was held Mon
day and definite working plans
made. Money is being raised by
subscription to cover much of the
expense, and it is hoped everyone
will contribute their share. The
committee has ordered five garbage
cans, which will be placed in con
venient places, and in reach of per
sons wishing to dispose of paper or
fruit refuse while on the street. We
hope these cans will help much in
keeping this refuse from the street
and sidewalk as has been the case
heretofore. Throughout the vil
lage, in places similar to Cross
street and Birch Point avenue, where
streets meet, and it is convenient,
the committee have made grass
plots or places for flowers and it is
expected the ladies will help in the
beautifying of the village by select
ing flowers for these places. It must
be remembered that the clean-up
committee cannot. alone clean the
whole community, and we wish to
ask for the cooperation of everyone,
especially property owners. If all the
people back up the movement with
their sympathies and a little honest
work, there will be no doubt as to
the results of their efforts. To en
courage the work the Bosworth
Store Co. offers the following prizes:
First prize $5, second prize $3,
third prizp $2, for the best kept
lawn and flower garden, prizes to be
awarded by the Clean-Up Com
mittee Sept. 1st next. All together
now, BOOST.
Apprentices Wanted: 15 to 18
years of age for machinist trade, for
period five years during which period
they will receive practical and tech
