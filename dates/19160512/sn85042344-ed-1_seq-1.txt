LONDON. May 11. (4:40 p. m
"Can anyone blume the people of
Dublin for believing dozens have been
Bhot secretly In barracks or wonder
why horrible rumors are embittering
them?" asked John Dillon today in
the houso ot commons, discussing his
resolution, which was voted down
without division, to confine the dis
cussion ot tho Irish revolt to the issuo
of military executions and the con
tinuance of martial law.
Dillon referred to the execution of
Thomas Kent in County Cork, saying
it looked as though there was a roving
com mission to curry out "tuesc hor
rible executions." Today Mr. lennani
unnjunced inure has been 14 execu
tions, he continued, although the
previous figure was 12. He asked
what people were to believe and added
that it viis no wonder muny viewed
the matter with gravest concern.
Mr. Dillon complained lhat Premier
Asqulth was kept in the dark by the
military authority as to what was go
ing on. Ho asserted that K. Shechy
bkeffington was shot on April and
the military authorities did not hear
ot it until May 6. ,
LOtflON, May 11. (5 p. nO
Mr. Dillon said Hint the tact lhat nino
out ot ten pi-ople In Ireland were on
the side of the government was duo
to the lifework of the NationaliFts
und now the present rule was wash
ing out that lifework in a seu of
blood."
A Utile Insurrection.
Out of the whole of Ireland, i.r.
Dillon continued, there were only lour
or live spots whore there was insur
rection, yet the whole country was un
der martial law niul '.here was abso
lutely no trace of tho civil administra
tion. The Irish people, he declared,
would refuso to ueeept the well km.vn
high character of General Maxwell as
the solo guarantee of their liberty unl
if tho military rule was to be con
tinued tho government had heeler get
ready one hundred thousand men to
Karrison the country.
if the English people had not been
K0 dense, said Mr. Dillon, they could
have had many of the rebels fighting
for them In tho I'.ritish army men
who were misled Into reocllinn but
of whose courage he was proud.
"Infamous I'hIscIhhmI."
The statement brought forth cries
of 'shame."
Dillon: "Who stopped them?
Unionist members: "You did.
Dillon: "That Is an Infamous
falsehood."

NOW HOW ABOUT THE
REGISTRARS MONEY?
May Pay Xci Officials Out of Con

Comities.
Special to Tha World.
OKLAHOMA CITY, May 11
County or precinct registrars under
the new registration law may be paid
out of the contingent fund of the
counties for Ihe flueal vear 1917. Is
held in an opinion from the attorney
nuuuitus oince to uovernor Williams.
In the inquiry sent by tho governor
it was suggested that tho contingent
funds of tho counties for 1916 were
practically exhausted and thut the law
says these expenses must be met by
the different counties from the con
tingent fund. It is pointod out by
the attorney-general's office that reg
istration, with the supplemental pe
riods, extends over into the 1917 fiscal
year and that the registration is not
finally done and enmnletnd until
shortly before the fall election. Hence
u iiiukcs little difference it the reg
istrar files his claim at the end of
tho service. If ho waits until that
time, ho may include his whole serv
lee and then tho county contingent
fund being available for the fiscal
year of 1917. the claim coul.l be Dald
with that fund.

that. With regard 'to our dispute

And actively engaged with every

Tho people look with suspicion
upon any movement that thu news
papers don't get behind.
The newspapers, therefore, carry
tho big end of the burden created by
tho boosters, because tho editor, In
addition to paying his share of
money needed, and doing his stunt in
working with the committee, fur
nishes the advertising space, pays out
real cash to the reporters to have
the boost dope prepared for publica
tion, and pavs out more real cash to
Hie printers for setting It up.
Triirt tho editor M'm n share of the
general prosperity which comes from
a sorrlble boost campaign, but his
share Is not eumnicnsurato with the
effort and the tln.c and the money
expended In the project.
This Is not a Jolly. Kvery editor
