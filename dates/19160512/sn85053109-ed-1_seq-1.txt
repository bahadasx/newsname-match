George Robinson will work this
summer in the Park, we understand.
George is a fine chap, and we wish
him health, wealth and happiness.
Arthur Sherburne has gotten in a
nice lot of new automobiles in his
garage next to the Orpheum. Go
it, "Art"!
"ike" Whistler is the ideal "Mine
Host," as well as an accomodating
postmaster. Isaac's "second term"
will never be in doubt, in so far as
the wishes of his patrons are con
cerned. He is everybody's friend.
Len Fox, we are informed, has
entirely recovered from his recent
sickness. "Len" is some potato
raiser, and we are exuecting some
"spuds."
Thomas Harwood was held here
for some time because of the small
pox scare. He was vaccinated
while among us, and has now re
turned to bis ranch in the far north
east corner of our Reserve. The
scare, thanks to the prompt action
of our Agency authorities, is en
tirely past.
It begins to look as if we wert*
going to have a good road soon be
tween Browning and Cut Bank.
Fred Ilixson is now '"The Village
Blacksmith," sure enough. He was
formerly of Glacier Park, and we
welcome him among our goodly
company of business men,
Mr. Tweedy is adding a good
sized room to his store building on
the public square, the new depart
ment being in front-line with the
other part of the store. It will be
a refreshment room, we understand.
Mr. Tweedy is a hustler who allows
no snow to melt or grass to grow
uuder his feet.
The Sherburne Mercantile Co. is
making extensive improvements to
ils large business house. This will
give iheru a roomy and airy butcher
department, with salesroom and
work shop.
With the regrets of all concerned,
Miss Kri. ger has had to resign her
position at the Blackfoot hospital
on account of poor health. It is
our sincere hope that she may soon
be restored to health and usefulness,
as she is a cheery and useful young
lady.
The Browning Review is giving
us some useful historical matter at
present, the article on Alaska, last
week, being one of the best. The
Indian lore contained in its pages
is always exact and well written.
Your correspondent has for many
years advocated just such a paper
for our tribe, and now that we have
it all should subscribe for it and
read it.
Curly Bear's thirteen y^ar-old

Where in America Can this
Record Be Beaten?
Martin Edwards' Own Story as Told by Himself-One of Many
Mr. and Mrs. Martin Edwa-ids
and their five sons came to the
Cut Bank community five
years ago. They had tried
renting a farm in Nebraska and
found it unprofitable, going from
there to the west coast country
and then to Canada, where they
had moderate success, but grew
discouraged on account of too
frequent frosts during the grow
ing season.
Mr. Edwards came here five
years ago with about $540.00.
Later his family followed and
all took up homesteads about
twenty miles north of Cut
Bank. With the meager sum
above mentioned they started
in to build up a new home. In
spite of the fact that there were
two or three unfavorable years
in the past five—when the
country was going through the
first raw process of develop
ment—this is how Mr. Edwards
and sons has succeeded here,
and the story as told by the
senior Edwards is not in a spirit
of boastfulness but prompted
by a desire to encourage others
who are not satisfied with being
vassals on rented farms in more
congested regions:
"We have 400 acres under
cultivation, $1200 in machinery,
about $7,000 in buildings and
CO. AGRICULTURIST DAVIS
SAYS TRY SWEET CLOVER
Much has been said about the
sweet clover plant, and many
have sounded the alarm. Be
ware. lest it becomes a pest.
But it is like a great many of
the o her plants that have just
kept on growing regardless of
the cry till many of the people
who sounded this cry are now
saying in an andertone it seems
worthy of a trial, and some are
bold enough to even advocate
sowing it.
It compares very favorably
as a hay with alfalfa and anal
ysis as high in its feed value.
But where I could grow alfalfa
successfully I would prefer to
do so.
Many seem to think that
stock will not take to it readilv.
It has a pronounced flavor and
odor of its own, that they may
or may not accept at first, but
when they once acquire the
habit it is settled for all time.
It is one of our legumes and
this family of plants compris
ing the clovers, common red,
white Dutch, Alsike, sweet
clover and alfalfa also the peas
and vetches. All those plants
have the property of gathering
nitrogen from the air and stor
ing it in the soil for plant growth,
and are being given more at
tention each year.
This fertilizing element is the
most costly and the most ex
pensive to procure and like all
other commodities has ad
vanced with the war. Yet the
air is abundantly supplied wilh
it and every farmer has enough
of it above his farm to make
him a millionaire if he could
only get hold of it and here is
a group of planta that will only
give them an opportunity to
work for you.
Sweet clover has a faculty
of growing where it is almost
too impossible to induce others
to grow. It v ill thrive where
it is too wet for alfalfa to grow,
where it is too dry, and also
where there is too much alkali.
But don't try it in
other personal effects, and have
100 head of cattle and 40 horses.
The crop we raised on our dif
ferent holdings in the year 1915
was nearly sufficient to wipe
out our indebtedness. Our
combined holdings total nearly
2,000 acres and in my own opin
ion there is no better grain land
in the United States. This sec
tion can't be beat for stock
raising, so I can't see where we
could have struck it better
than by coming to this part of
Montana when we did."
Here is the plain statement
of a man who tried his fortune
in other parts of the West and
was disappointed. Coming
here five years ago with less
than $600.00, Mr. Edwards and
his sons have accumulated real
estate and personal effects that
today would be appraised at
around $50,000.
The story needs no emphasis.
Where in America would a like
opportunity present itself to
Martin Edwards? And while
the opportunity of five years
ago cannot be found here today,
still there are exceptional
chances for the man of energy
and judgment to come here now
and within the next half dec
ade almost rival the above rec
ord.
swampy places, or where al
kali has crusted the ground as
this is too much an extreme.
K should have a fall plowed
seedbed, thoroughly and deepiy
plowed, worked well and pro
perly packed.
It may be sown any time in
the early spring and I have not
yet seen any of it injured by
the frosts or freezes. It may
be sown with or without the
nurse crop, but do not try to
raise two full crops from the
land at the same time with
manure for only one.
In this case the nurse crop
becomes a starving crop robbing
the sweet clover of its moisture,
It makes a better pasture plant
than alfalfa as it never causes
bloat, and if not eaten too
closely will re-seed itself.
As a soil-builder I do not
think there is a plant in its
class, that will compare with it.
It will greatly improve the stiff,
heavy gumbo soils. The roots
will make them more porous
and bv the decaying roots thus
add to its humus and decayed
organic matter elements in
which these soils are deficient
here and make them more
easily worked.
It will give more growth to
plow under than any other
plant of its group and in this
way be a great help in pre
paring the land for sugar beet
growing by its nitrogen gather
ed and the amount of organic
matter left in the soil.
It also gathers the bacteria
for inoculation more readily
than alfalfa, thus making it a
good plant to precede alfalfa
and pave the way for its suc
cessful growing.
None of this family will
thrive under more varied con
ditions of soil, altitude or mois
ture than will sweet clover.
The two varieties used are
the white and vellow blossom.
The white grows more rank
and a little coarser than the yel

Long Auto Trip
Robert Martin and R o w e

from Pleasant Valley, have just
completed an interesting auto
trip. They left Kalamazoo,
Mich., April 20 in a Ford car
and arrived safely in Pleasant
Valley early this week, having
performed the journey without
serious mishap. Their total ex

but the boys say the weather
was a trifle chilly for such a
trip.
Base Ball Dance
The base ball club will give a
dance in Brown's hall next Sat

John Redmond
on Irish Revolt
Noted Nationalist Leader
Deplores Ill-Advised
Movement
The recent deplorable Irish
revolt,so completely suppressed,
was recently summed up by the
great Irish leader, John Red
mond, and we believe a great
majority of Irish in America
will concur with his view, a
portion of which follows:
"My first feeling, of course,
on hearing of this insane move
ment, was one of horror, dis
couragement and almost de
spair. I asked myself whether
Ireland, as so often before in
her tragic history, was to dash
the cup of liberty from her lips
—was the insanity of a small
section of her people once again
to turn all her marvelous vic
tories of the last few years into
irreparable defeat, and to send
her back, on the very eve of
her final recognition as a free
nation, into another long night
of slavery, incalculable suffer
ing and weary and uncertain
struggling?
"For look at the Irish position
today. In the short space of 40
years Ireland has by a constitu
tional movement made an al
most unbrokenly triumphant
march from pauperism and pov
erty to prosperity and freedom.
"Is all this to be lost?
"When war came, she made
a choice which was inevitable if
she was to be true to all the
principles which she had just
so completely vindicated on her
own soil, namely, the rights of
small nations, sacred principles
ol nationality, liberty and
democracy."
