day night. .
Hiram 'a arrest .was brought' about
by dlscOYeries yesterday -by Captaid
McDuffie at the Hiram ,hcrme. Hiram
admitted today that he did the job.
He 8aya another waa with him, but
from the way the atory is told the
captain believes Hiram was alone. ' -
.Yesterday Captain McDuffie found
a - horn to a phonograph taken from
the Cunha home. Today every article
stolen from Cunha was located in and
about jthe Hiram place Somo were

Mrs. jCunha'a. silk hose were 'under a
bed; the other part of the phonograph
bad been thrown In the stream, near

burled under the steps. Ka
f Besides the Cunha property, .Captain
McDuffie discorered a valuable watch
stolen from J. J. C. Haynea , of the Com
mercial Pacific Cable Company about
a year and a halt ago from his home
at Walklki. ; , ;U Wi
Hiram aaya ,vhe . did ..not take ,the
watch, but got It from at, soldier About
a year ago in a era p-ehoo ting gamf.U)
Iwlleu A ring taken at the same time

Mr. Haynes Is now. wit the eimai
eompany in San Francisco. ' He baa
been notified .of the discovery The
watch Is a f Hamilton -nake, valued at
over $100. : r . i '-r i -
- An interesting feature in connection
with the discovery of Haynea watch
Is that Haynes was heartily disgusted
with the police .at the . time of the rob
bery because they did , not 'locate hla
valuables at once. - '
"It la with a great deal of satisfac
tion that we have notified Mr. Haynea
of ' the recovery of hla watch,"- said
Deputy Sheriff Jullua WV Aach today,
"for he waa especially loud In hts con
demnation of the police at. the time.
"It is seldom that jewelry stolen by
burglars la recovered at alU said Mr.
McDuffie. Mr.. Haynes cAn consider
himself lucky that he is" getting his
watch back after a year and a half."
Captain ' McDuffie sair, today, that
the arrest of Hiram and finding 'the
stolen, property may clear up a num
bexof robberies which have taken
place at WafklKL ' ;
, Hiram has no particular occupation,
according to the police. Mrs. Hiram
manages the home and Is - better
known as Madame Puahi. She gives
exhibitions of the old Hawaiian danc

"Discriminations in Nevy Law
Cited By Judge Ashf ord;
v Up taHim topectde
.4
A man who earna more 'ftan j84 a
week Is rich, while one whoeaxna less
Is poor. .This la the inference gained
by. Circuit Judge Ashf ortf -from the
provisions of the Worfcman'a Compen
sation Act accdrdlng to a statement
made by him from the bench today.
. The first starts to test th constltu
tionality of - the act, as approved by
the governor, were taken,; in Judge
Ashford's court today .with the begin
ning of argument on demurred filed
In the damage suits brought by j, j,
Carroll against the Marconi Wireless
Company and E. T. Anderson against
the Hawaiian Dredging Company.
It was pointed out to" Judge' Ashford
that "a man who is earning S100 or
1250 a week is . excluded, under the
provisions of the act, . ' .; ? , i
V 'Therefore; It appears that we have
one law for the poor and another Tor
the rich," Judge Ashf ord commented.
, when informed that the provisions
of the law do not include domestic
servants, Judge Ashford. said: : " ;.
"Why not? Isn't that a dlscrimtna
tion and one which the constitution
might not uphold? ' ' ,
The court took; as an example an
accident in which a man earning 126
a week ' loses a leg, while another
man, earning (37? a week is similarly
injured. , In this oase, he said.r the
man earning (36 a week might recover
damages, while, the other man 'could
not '.-: : :-:.--.a--;.v.
"How are you going to justify that
discrimination?" the court wanted to
know. ; :-., . -.
" There ' was also argument , of the
provision that the Industrial Accident
Board, at its discretion, may appoint
a trustee, or third person, to take
charge of any funds awarded a - per
son Injured, and pay to the complain
ant certain sums either out of the
principal or the income, v " 1 v
Vfls . not that, an invasion of the
rights of the injured- man to collect
damages for injuries to his person or
health!! asked Judge Ashford. . !
Prior to the beginning of argument
today Judge Ashford denied the right
of the attorney-general or any -of his
deputies to appear in the easel
The law provides that whenever
the territory is party ; to a suit', or
action, either criminal or civil, or In
terested In a suit or action, the attorney-general
shall appear personally
or by his deputy. y
By law the city attorney Is a deputy
of the attorney-general. The attorney-
general was present today. Intending
to enter his name and have the" city
attorney' appear in his behalf in Mat
ters regarding the constitutionality ot
the, act. which was attacked. Judge
Ashford, however, refused to let the
attorney-general appear, either as a
matter of right or as amicus curiae,
or friend of the court. : ' .-

waa to be held this afternoon.. -
