Cresco An Auto Trail Center.
Cresco was visited on Tuesday by A.
E. Nissen, of Iowa City, supervisor of
the Cedar Rapids—St. Paul Division
and the Burlington Way, "the best
marked trail in the world," mention of
which was made by the Plain Dealer a
few weeks ago. He was accompanied
by Dr. Mark Newland, of Center
Point, Iowa, also a supervisor of a di
vision of the trail and W. R. Watsa
baugh, an attorney of Center Point.
They were driven to Cresco by J. A.
Wicke, an expert demonstrator and
path finder in his Moline-Knight. The
party left Cedar Rapids at 8:23 a. m.
and arrived in Cresco at 5:25 p. m.
Their official schedule showed stops ag
gregating 4i hours making their actual
road time 4 hours and 32 minutes for a
recorded distance of 121.4 miles.
At an informal meeting held in the
evening it was decided to form a local
organization to co-operate with the
officials of the Burlington Way and as
sist in the work of properly biazing the
trail through Cresco which is surely lo
cated on what is termed the parent
trail and the shortest organized auto
route connecting St. Louis and St.
Paul. The local club will see that
every pole in its territory is painted
with the orange and white signs and
that official sign boards be placed one
mile north and one mile south of the
town.
The organization will also make an
effort to secure Cresco a place on the
route of the LaCrosse, Tama and Kan
sas City trail, now being projected and
already located to New Hampton and
undecided whether to proceed to La
Crosse through Cresco or by way of
Calmar and Decorah.
Cresco is also on what is known as
the "Imperial Highway," a trail run
ning from east to west from Lansing
to Spirit Lake, a fine route but at pres
ent unmarked and the Cresco organiza
tion will endeavor to assist in properly
marking this route, as welljis a route
from Austin, Minn., to Calmar and Mc
Gregor.
At McGregor last week an enthusias
tic gathering organized an .^to Trq^
•npert, Dubuque and Cresco Division of
tlw Burlington Way. Over 90 repre
sentative!* from towns all the way from
Dubuque to Cresco were present, and
C. W. Reed, of Cresco was selected as
one of the vice-presidents of the asso
ciation.
The route has been definitely estab
lished to pass through Davenport, De
Witt, Welton, Maquoketa, Dubuque,
Holy Cross, Luxemburg, Millville, Gut
tenberg, McGregor and Cresco. From
Dubuque to Guttenberg the road has
been mapped but from Guttenberg to
McGregor and McGregor to Cresco it
is yet to be laid out and sharp compe
tition from the different towns and the
farmers along the different proposed
lines is promised. Four routes from
McGregor to Cresco are under discus
sion. The first, the North Iowa Pike
from McGregor to Calmar second the
Pleasant Ridge road to Monona, thence
over North Iowa Pike to Calmar third
Pleasant Ridge road to Monona, thence
to Volney, Waukon, Decorah, along
county roads and fourth from Postvilie
via Frankville and Decorah to Cresco.
Kick by Hone Canses Death.
Clarence Ludwig, aged 30, son of Geo.
Ludwig, residing just east of Granger,
was kicked by a colt on Tuesday after
noon resulting in injuries which caused
peritonitis from which death resulted
at about 8:30 Wednesday morning.
The deceased was watering a team of
which the colt was one, preparatory to
going to the field, and stepped behind
them to go to the well house for a drink
when the colt kicked him in the abdom
en. But little attention was paid to the
matter at the time a.id the young man
intended to continue work but was later
0 attacked with severe pain. Dr. Tier
ney was called and could not determine
the full extent of the injuries and was
later recalled, and in the morning Dr.
Kessell was called in consultation, but
all to no avail.
The funeral will be held Sunday after
noon at the Florenceville Church.
Sairide By Hanging.
Henry Clausson, aged 55 years, a
farmer residing southwest of Bonair,
committed suicide late Thursday af ter
noon of last week by hanging himself
from the binding pole on a load of hay
in his barnyard. Although having not
given any intimation that such an act
was premeditated, he had worried con
siderably over business affairs and his
rash act was doubt ess due to financial
difficulties.
His funeral was held on Sunday after
Ij.noon, conducted by Rev. Guy Ruther
ford, with interment in the Howard
Coiter Cemetery.
