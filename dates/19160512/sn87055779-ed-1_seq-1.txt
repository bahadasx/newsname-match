International Newr-i Scnlo:
WASHINGTON', May l- The
entire structure of American trans
portation rates both land and by
water has been undermined by the
Kiropean war and the interstate
commerce commission is f;;cing a
ery serious task in attempting to
bring order out of the general i on-
fusinn now reigning in the tr.uis-
j.r.rtation world. The neu- situations
developed by the war are:
The congestion of freight tars in
the east.
The serious shortage of cm, in
the west, holding up shipments of
food, manufactured and raw ma
terials and generally embarrassing
middle western industry.
Pemnnds of railroads for higher
rates on commodities which have
increased in value because f war
orders. In this eonnK-tton freight
rates are usually largely Wasod on
the alue of the article curried.
The necessity for the establish
ment of new arrangements for joint
rates ami through rates to facilitate

terior points to the feacoas:.

The throwing out of adjust merit

the I'nited States to another.
The suspension of coastwise trade

available. This has entailed the es
tablishment of new rates structui .

tail lines.

Plumbers Join
Steamfitters in
Strike; 59 Out
I "ifty-nine plumbers and steam
fitters, members of the loral branch
of the I'nited assoebition, 'hicago.
are on strike today in South Itend.
The steamfitters sttuek May 1,
charginz that their emplovers Ir.-k -
ed tfi-m out. The plumbers were
called ou; last nigdit. None of the
union men came to work Friday
morrune.
The trouble between the lahm
men and the "bos-es" as far as can
le learned, concerns the proposfd
ratification of a new agreement
vvhih is to Co into effeet June 1.
Tlie stcamtitters drew up a new
s .ile for approval, but they claim.
thir employers attempted to coerce
them into signing up the old agree
ment which was effective during- the
past year. They refused and then,
they say, the bosses' locked shop
on them. The new agreement called
for a slight wage increase, but the
other provisions remained practical
ly the same as in the old one.
Tiie plumbers signed up the old
agreement but struck Frida v morn
intr following the failure of the labor
representatives of the steamt.tters'
union and the employers to get to
gether. loth the plumbers and
steamfitters are organized under the
same head here.
The present disagreement, accord
ing to the labor officials, will lie set
tled by compromise measures within
the next few da vs.

starting from an unknown cause in
Pec-carol's livery barn in the rear of
market st.. near Wayne, today
spread to adjoining business blocks
and for a time threatened the entire
downtown section. The livery barn
was consumed so quickly that it was
with great ditliculty that the horses
were gotten out.
A strong southeast wind swept the
flames to the f u r-.st ory i-ichmidt
block on the corner of Wayne and
Market sts.. and this building vva.s
completely gutted; the local fire com
panies being unable to check the
wind-driven blaze.
When it was seen that the
Schmidt block was doomed, the fire

structures which had been set afire
by flying sparks and word was sent
to Toledo and Klyria summoning
help. Flames began to belch from
the Kuntz block, another four-story

and Mexico. Reports of new raids

Snipers in the vicinity of Roquil

gone across the border brousht back
news that new bands were forming;
on the southern side of the Rio

American troopers from Rrowns

Mexican outlaws who killed Curtis

yesterday. The raiders sneaked in
on Hayles" ranch and their victim
was killed tt the first fire. Members
of his family later drove off the at

From Mexico's interior there also
came reports of new anti-American
demonstrations. In Chihuahua and

radical speakers are allowed to ad
dress wild mobs in that section with
out restraint from Carranza officials.
The American authorities are on
the alert for signs of uprising on the

waiting for the first signs of new

The principle feature of the inter
