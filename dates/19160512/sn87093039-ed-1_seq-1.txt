THREE STATE CON
VENTIONS IN A WEEK
Democrats, Progressives and Republi
cans—Meet, Adopt Platforms
and Name Delegates
Rarely in the past have three ereat
political'parties held their conventions
in one week. The democrats met in
Yakima on Tuesday of last week, the
progressives on Friday in Seattle, and
the republicans on Saturday in Yakima.
Adopting platforms and naming dele
gates to the national convention and
presidential electors was the principal
business transacted. Nothing occurred
at either meeting to rivet the atten
tion of the public.
The democrats had little to discuss
except their own patronage problems,
which they settled by making Hugh
Wallace, who lives in Washington, D.
C, their national committeeman, be
cause he is close to the national ad
ministration and controls'" all federal
jobs in this state anyway.
The republicans had many interest
ing contests for detegates to the na
tional convention at Chicago in June.
The delegation will be uninstructed,
and will follow its best judgment, and
future developments, in determining
how the votes of this state will be cast
for candidates for the presidential nom
ination. The delegates at Yakima all
predicted sweeping republican victories
thruout the state this fall.
The progressives practically agreed
that they might as well return and join
the republicans, altho expressing a
preference for Roosevelt for president.
Each party adopted a state platform,
the democrats simplyrendorsing Wilson
and Lister, while the^'republicans de
nounced the present foreign policy,
demanded a protective tariff andjother
wise adhered to the well;defined prin
ciples of the party, including a strong
"preparedness" plank.
50,000 Troops on the Mexican
Border
The sending of 8,000 more troops
to the Mexican border this week will
raise the total number doing duty down
there to 50,000. Four thousand na
tional guardsmen from the states of
Texas, New Mexico and Arizona are
among the last 8,000. Troops from
Fort Wright, Spokane; from Fort Wor
den and Flagler, at the entrance to
Puget Sound, and from Fort Lawton,
Seattle, have received orders from
Washington to move to the Texas bor
der, and will leave for their destination
this week. Troops from the Vancouver,
Wash., barracks have also been ordered
to the border. It is probable the Ta
coma cavalary militia company may be
called on. They have been ordered
to hold themselves in readiness. The
movement of troops to the Mexican
border to do active service has stimu
lated enlistment all over the country.
Duncan-Kalles
Miss Coyle Duncan and Mr. E. V.
Kalles were united in wedlock last Sun
day at the home of the bride's parents,
Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Duncan, who re
sides east of town. The ceremony
was performed by Rev. Moore, of the
M. E. church. Only a few intimate
friends of the family were present.
Mr. and Mrs. Kalles will make their
home in Leavenworth. It is Mr.
Kalles' intention to remove to Alpha,
Wash., this fall, where he has a farm.
As later reports come in from this
and the adjoining states of Idaho and
Montana the damage to crops from the
severe cold weather is reported on the
increase. In the Yakima valley the in
jury to the fruit crop is said to be quite
serious. .
Mri. A. H. Sylvester left yesterday
lor Spokane on a visit to Mr. and Mrs.
W. Stanley Cames.
Mr and Mrs. Thos. Mullen left yes
terday afternoon for a brief visit with
friends at sundry coast points.
Uhc Xeavenwottb 'mmi
junketing Party Leaves Wenat
chee, June 5
A lot of Wenatchee boosters will
leave the fifth of next month for the
Okanogan country on a five-day trip
thru that rapidly developing fruit sec
tion. There will be from fifteen to
twenty auto loads in the party and the
entire upper country will be visited.
Those Wenatchee fellows are wise in
their day and generation in cultivating
the good fellowship of residents in that
rapidly developing country. There is
a lot of business for their town up
there and it is growing every year.
6. F. COLPRETT IS VICTIM
Of ELECTRIC SHOCK FRIDAY
Accident Near G. N. Power Plant—Steel
Tape Comes in Contact with High
Power Transmission Wire
Young Colprit was employed with a
surveying crew and had hold of a steel
tape the other end of which another
man was trying to hoist over a bush,
when the tape came in contact with
the transmission wire carrying 16,000
volts and supplying the power for roov
ine trains thru the Cascade tunnel.
He must have had his foot on one of
the rails that made a ground contact.
Both arms were badly burned and his
right foot and leg was also badly
burned up to the knee. He told Dr.
Hoxsey, who attended him, that his
home was in Portland, where his
mother lived. The accident occurred
last Friday within a few minutes of
twelve o'clock, a short distance from
the G. N. power plant, about three
miles from town. He lived about six
hours. His mother was promptly noti
fied by the railroad company. The
remains were shipt to Portland last
Saturday.

Mrs. F. T. Motteler, Mrs. E. Moh
ler and Mrs. J. D. Wheeler are to be

M. Green, who is to leave in a few
days for Yakima to make her home.
Mrs. Green is a member of the O. E. S.
and the members of that order and
other friends have been invited.
892 Auto Licenses in County
Nearly one hundred more automo
bile licenses have been issued in Che
lan county this year than in 1915. The
total number to date issued to residents
of the county is 892. Last year 813
tags were issued but a number of these
were to residents of Douglas county.
Under the new system of segregation,
licenses are credited to the county in
which the applicant lives, regardless of
where the license is taken out.

The Higher Up the Valley You Go the Bigger and Better the Apples Grow
Leavenworth, Wash., Friday, May 12, 1916
REWARD IS OffERED
BY THE CITY COUNCIL
Fines Will Be Split 50 50 in Gambling
and Bootlegging Cases With Per
son furnishing Evidence
All members were present at the
regular meeting of council Tuesday
evening except Snyder and Wolden
burg.
Bills amounting to $498.30 were al
lowed and ordered paid.
The matter of painting the city hall
suggested at a previous meeting, after
some discussicn, was laid over.
The city jail, the building of which
was begun last fall, received the finish
ing touches Tuesday and was inspected
and approved by the council.
There is a section in the west end of
town in which the drainage is very
bad and Wm. Moon was given the
contract of putting in five culverts of
an adequate size to'carry off the water.
Dr. A. R. McKeown was given a
permit for the new brick building he
is having erected on Front street. He
also asked permission to take up the
old board walk in front of the building
and replace it with cinder. After this
settles he proposes to top it with ce
ment. This request was also granted.
The following motion was passed af
ter some discussion:
"Fifty per cent of each fine will be
given to the person furnishing evi
dence leading to conviction for unlaw
ful sale of liquor or gambling in Leav
enworth, or that a minimum reward of
850 be paid for evidence leading to
conviction for each case of unlawful
sale of liquor in Leavenworth."
This gives some local Sherlock a
rare chance to make some easy money.
If the empty bottles that have been
picked up in the past three months are
any criterion there must have been
barrels of liquor sold in this community
since the ban was put on booze.

Frost Damage in Upper Valley Light
Mr. and Mrs. M. W. Starks were in
Leavenworth Wednesday. Speaking to
Mr.Starks, who is one of the largest apple
growers in the Upper Wenatchee valley,
he said in regard to the frost of the
first three nights this week: "I do not
think the damage is serious. I have
made an examination in my orchards
and so far as I can judge at this time
the damage is negligible. Perhaps it
may have made thinning unnecessary."
Guy Stage, another of the old apple
growers of the Peshastin valley, said to
a representative of this paper one day
this week that he did not think the
frost damage would amount to enough
to take into consideration.
J. Fred Wright of the Wright & Day
ranch, two miles east of Leavenworth,
came here Wednesday to take the train
for Seattle. Speaking of the frost dam
age the first three nights this week,
which gave some cause for apprehen
sion, he said: "Our trees are not yet
in the full bearing stage, expecting
only about two thousand boxes this
year. We do not think the frost has
done any damage in our orchards, with
the exception, possibly, of the cherry
trees, of which we have only a few for
domestic use. Ido not think the frost
has done any damage. The apple
trees are of course the principal things
with us and they have not suffered, in
my judgment."
Fourteen Irish Rebels Executed.
Up to this time fourteen of the ring
leaders in the Irish rebellion have been
executed by the English government.
Six were sentenced to imprisonment at
hard labor and seventy-three to penal
servitude. The woman leader was sen
tenced to imprisonment. The feeling,
both in England and Ireland, is so
strong there will probably be no fur
ther executions.

All this has more than passing inter
