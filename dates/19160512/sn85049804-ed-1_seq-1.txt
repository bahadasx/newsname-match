EDITORIAL FROM THE ANA
MOSA EUREKA, ANAMOSA,
IOWA, MAY 4, 1916.
With five primary candidates in the
field for attorney general there is
bound to be confusion among the vot
ers in arriving at an intelligent choice.
Without attempt at speaking in dis
paragement of any of the other can
didates we feel like saying, a very
kindly word for Mr. H. M. Havner of
Marengo. He is ripened in experi
ence. Those who are close to him
readily put forward the very best rea
sons why he should be favorably con
sidered. He is conservative, depend
able and fearless. Mr. Havner would
make a very acceptable attorney gen
eral. Perhaps he might not be quite
as active gaining publicity as some
of the other fellows, but he would be
found at his job, and that counts in
the long run.

SAMPSON FOR ATTORNEY GEN
ERAL.
For a number of years we have had
the pleasure of a personal acquaint
ance with Mr. Sampson, the popular
candidate for attorney general, and
are glad to add a word of commenda
tion for his strong integrity and high
professional standing as a lawyer.
By nature, surroundings and training
his sympathies are with the masses
and he is a true friend of the people,
and interested in the welfare of each
one of them.
Conditions in Iowa at this time are
such that the office of attorney gen
eral is almost as important as that
of governor. The man best fitted for
this high office is Mr. Sampson, who
during the past five years has served
as an able assistant to Attorney Gen
eral Cosson. Because of the valuable
training had under Mr. Cosson and
on account of his intimate knowledge
of the work of: the offlce he is just the
man to assume fjtfl charge of,the af
faire When Mr. Cosson retires. He i*
accounted one of the good lawyers of
the state, ?.nd is a man of high char
acter and strong convictions he has
the courage to stand for the right as
he sees it. His name, Sampson, im
plies strength, and he is proving the
strong candidate, and will be a strong
attorney .General when elected.
THE BIRTH OF A NATION CASE.
Although one of the I6ngest and
most bitterly contested trials ever con
ducted in our local municipal court,
Judge J. E. Meyer of the criminal di
visioa yesterday morning discharged
the manager of the Berchel theater,
finding him not guilty of violating any
city ordinance in putting on the photo
play "The Birth of a Nation." The
trial lasted just one week and about
fifteen of che leading white ministers,
lawyers, business men and veterans of
the civil war in this city were exam
ined on each side thooe produced by
the prosecution testifying without ex
ception that the exhibition was inde
cent, immoral, lewd and inflammatory
and that it was calculated to create
prejudice, hatred and antipathy for
members cf the Negro race and those
produced by the defense on the other!
hand with the same unanimity testi
fying that the exhibition was none
of these things.
In addition to this the defense at
tacked the validity of the ordinance
under which .the prosecution was
brought as being unconstitutional and
void.
The judge in his opinion upheld the
validity of the ordinance, but said he
was not satisfied that he could say
beyond a reasonable doubt that the
exhibition was indecent, lewd or im
moral or that it was calculated to
create a feeling of prejudice, hatred
or antipathy against any particular
race or class of individuals and there
fore gave no the defendants the bene
fit of the doubt and found them not
guilty, and while all of our friends in
the community regret very much that
the decision was against us on the
merits of the exhibition, yet we are
satisfied that the fact that three of
the leading white ministers, four of
the leading white lawyers and othev
prominent white business men, such
as the president of the Ragsdale
Printing Co., the private secretary to
the governor and the associate editors
of the Register and Tribune and the
National Prohibitor, after having wit
nessed the exhibition took the witness
stand and upheld every contention
that had been urged by Attorneys
Woodson and Brown and the other of
ficials of the Des Moines Branch
proves /conclusively that there must
have been some just ground for the
protest made by the national associa
tion for the Advancement of Colored
People and cannot be other than help
ful to our cause in this community,
and while we are not accustomed to
rejoice at another's misfortune, it
should be a source of some satisfac
tion for our friends to know that in
stead of increasing the receipts of the
owners of the exhibition, as had been
predicted, they themselves admit that
they have not had but two or three
full houses in almost two weeks of
two performances each day and that
the expense of defending against this
litigation has cost them more than
they have inade on the engagement in
this city.
Too much cannot be said in com
mendation of the manly stand and
able assistance rendered us by Cor
poration Counsel Hon. H. W. Byers
and his capable assistant, Guy Miller,
city solicitor, our attorneys, Woodson
and Brown, and Hon. Casper Schenk,
the latter Ihree of whom gave their
valuable services without money,
though without price.

SENA!OR THOMAS FOR STATE
TREASURER.
Abraham Lincoln, the great eman
ciator of the colored race, in his early
manhood made a trip down the Mis
sissippi to New Orleans in a flat boat.
While there he witnessed the sale
from ai auction block of a colored
slave, a mother separated from her
child. His great human heart revolt
ed at the inhuman sight and he then
and there made a vow to1 Heaven that
if he ever was given an opportunity
to hit the institution of human slav
ery he would hit it hard. This op
portunity came when he signed the
emancipation proclamation that gave
freedom to a race in the great Amer
ican republic.
Senator Thomas, candidate for the
republican nomination for state treas
urer, was reared a poor boy on an
Iowa farm and began life ther as a
wage earner at 20 years of age at the
low wage of 55 cents a day. An old
cobbler trusted him for a pair of half
soles on his well worn shoes before

he could begin the job. He has tasted
poverty and hard work on the ground
floor and in his early struggles the
purpose was burned into his life that
if ever the opportunity came to him
to he\p make the path easier and
brighter for the children of toil who
were travelingg over the same road
he came over that, God helping him,
he would try to do that thing. His
opportunity came, too, when he' was
elected to the senate of Iowa four
years ago. He has been a consistent
friend of the colored race and, as a
member of the general assembly, one
of the best friends of labor that has
ever held a seat in the legislature of
Iowa. He was the author and ably
championed the bill to fix the mini
mum wage and the maximum hour to
protect women and minors in certain
lines of employment where they are
notoriously underpaid and overwork
ed. Of the minimum wage law for
teachers. Of the blue sky law to pro
tect the people from the sale of
worthless stocks and bonds, the loss
from which amounts to millions of
dollars annually and falls mostly up
on the people of moderate means.
He supported the compensation law
and every measure that had for its
object improved conditions for labor.
It is a record that ought to secure the
support of every colored voter.
WHY THE NEGRO WOMAN
SHOULD VOTE.
By Mrs. G. L. Johnson, Des Moines.
The question has been asked me,
over and over again, "Why does the
Negro woman want to vote?" If the
universal cry was "Votes for white
women, we wiould say, sure enough,
that slavery was at our back door,
waiting for a chance to sneak in. But,
on the other hand, they are saying,
"We women want the vote," "we will
work togelher to get it," "we must
have it," "it will help both of our
conditions."
The Negro race, ever since they
have existed, have always been class
ed as an inferior race—for one reason
is, that our foreparents were once
slaves—that did nothf but till the
soil and perve their masters and go
and come at their master's biddings.
Other races thought it, and they acted1
it, so that our parents were made to
believe it.
When the emancipation isue was at
stake, it was by the strong efforts of
a loyal few white women of the north,
backed by the emancipator, that our
forefathers and mothers were made
free. Then our mothers worked hard
both tiigfct and-« day, -struggling,
through life, with the determination
to educate you and me. The results
have been most wonderful, as we have
lawyers, doctors, merchants, pharma
cists, bankers—in fact all professions
that other races enjoy, we have them
also.
Why is it that there are three girls
to every boy that graduates. Doesn't
it show that woman are more pro
gressive, and that women are not con
tented with a few things, andi her
mind seems to crave a broader scope
of life than the man?
We have had for years a woman
president of a bank in Richmond, Va.,
who is praised very highly for her
ability and progressive Spirit.
We as a race have been made to
feel that this is our country, because
we have served it—and served it well
—and we have a right to partake of
all things that have a tendency to de
velop our intellect and become more
citizenized.
You take the foreigner, he will
come to this country, and after a cer
tain number of years: he becomes
Americanized—that means that he
has made up in his mind that he will
stand by our president, and protect
our flag. Surely we feel more obli
gated to do the same thing, since we
were bred and born in America.
Now after the civil war there were
certain restrictions on the Negro
voter, that is, he had to have a cer
tain amount of education before he
could be a voting citizen. Well, you
find in the south today that education
is not the thing that holds the Negro
back, but it is prejudice, and there's
such a foothold on it until it will take
years to destroy.
The reason the southern states

GRIFFIN FOR SHERIFF.
The above cut is a true likeness of
John F. Griffin, the present sheriff,
who is .a candidate for renomniation.
Mr. Griffin is one of our Polk county
boys and has been active in the re-,
publican party for many years. He
has made a splendid sheriff, giving all
classes a fair treatment, and his
many friends feel that it is no mora
than right that he should be renomi
nated again, as complimentary for his
splendid services thus rendered.
could not come to a national settle
ment on the question of suffrage was
because they knew tfeat if they asked
for "woman suffrage," that would in
clude the Negro woman also—that
the voting white southerner did not
want, so you will find that the statea
that are most prejudiced are Texas,
Arkansas, Missouri, Alabama and
Florida—and all of the outhern states,
because they haven't decided how they
could manage to grant the white wo*
man the vote and exclude the Negra
woman at the same time.
Now we -i, Des Moines for in-'
instance, in a free for all state, our
race is segregated in all social lines
of amusement—but the Iowa stata
laws are not the back of it well,
what is the back of it? The preju
diced southerner, who has come here
and poisoned the good feelings of the
opposite race with the Negro race. We
women are handicapped. We have no
vote. But we are asked by the good
white women to lend them a hand to
secure a vote for all women. Are OUP
men so blind that they can't see how
the ^uifrage: m5r c&n"1ielp'
more than any other so-called
woman on the globe.
Just suppose now iw "Thq Birth of'
a ation" would have shown here next
year, about this time, and the legis
lature, meeting here this fall, and the
women wuld get the vote on June S
this year, what do you think would
become of the play? I can tell you,
with the 7,000 white club women of
this city, together with our club wo
men, and the voting males that are
against it now, there would be no
chance other than defeat, and it would
not even enter the state. That is the
way to do business.
The men are dependent on our wo
men and they can't deny it. For in«
stance, look how quick the men ap
pealed to the federated club womeii
of this city in the prevention of th»: pil
play I've just mentioned. The women
in a body had a session with the conn-,
cil and made good, tring appeals
against the play. Finally the ooun
cilmen and mayor just hooted them
off by saying, "Oh, well, we can do
we please about this play the women
have no vote, they can't hurt us any
way. But yet our men can't see that*
We want the men to understand that
we don't want the vote to take full
charge of the government, but we
want to help them. It isn't because^I,
they don't mean well, but there are
things that are overlooked by rnen^*
that women would be wide-awake to,
if only given a chance.
A certain senator from Mississippi
said on one occasion that "Whv, th®
women don't need the vote, for this
reason, that they could generally in
fluence their husbands to vo+e th©
way they wanted them to anyway,'*
but this statement has been p'oven
false here in this state. How is ita
when the man doesn't bother himself!
about voting at all Then there^ is|
not a single vote cast in that family.!

at stake, it has been claimed that
there are twice as many men voting
now than before. Why? Because
they don't want the women to walk i®
and catch them napping. From alt
indications am forced to believe that
the reason our men don't want theif^
women to vote is because' they se
quite worried, thinking that we migt
win out ahead of them. Why is it tin
they never think that going out dofa|
extra work away from home r*"
make women more masculine, and.
easting their ballot will ttuute
so? When the woman leaves he
and workB all day and returns
woiks half of the night to
things pleasant St home,
can't she be pleasured enough if it
her desiies, to give her the b«llot?
way for the men
prove thei* unselfishness, progresaivi
ness and.fairness is to vote on Juntfl.
for woman suffrage.
