POLITICAL POT
BEGINS TO BOIL
IN CAPE COUNTY
Republicans Trying to Pick
Strongest Man in G. O. P.
Race For Congress.
RUSSEL WON'T BE
OPPOSED IN PRIMARY
County Leaders Find Difficulty
in Climbing into Guberna
torial Band Wagons.
With the National conventions less
than a month away, the political pots
are beginning to boil in Cape Girar
deau County. Republicans are more
active than Democrats, although the
latter are beginning to display in
terest. The Republicans are most interested
just now in the race for the nomina
tion for Congress. Three candidates
are going to divide the party vote in
this county, and at present R. J. Smith
of Dunklin County seems to have a
slight edge on the situation, although
there is no concerted movement in his
behalf. The strongest factor for
Smith is the support he is getting
from J. Henry Caruthers. who is a
candidate to succeed himself as Prose
cuting Attorney.
Mr. Caruthers is actively for Smith,
and he is certain to prove beneficial
to the Dunklin County prosecuting at
torney. David W. Hill of Poplar Bluff
has !ome supporters of influence in
the County, but they have show n little
activity.
Henry Wilson of Ava, who has not
been seriously considered, is going to
develop some strength in this county.
Republicans say he will get a good
vote in the western counties.
Congressman Joseph J. Russell is
going to be nominated by the Demo
crats without opposition, and it is
hardly expected that he will return
from Washington until the National
convention convenes in St. Louis.
The gubernatorial race is attracting
some attention, both in Republican
and Democratic circles. The Republi
cans have four candidates to pick
from, while the Democrats have at
least seven. According to well in
formed politicians, the Democratic
vote for Governor will be divided
among Cel. Fred D. Gardner of St.
Louis, Secretary of State Roach and
John Atkinson. Harry E. Alexander
has been selected to manage the Gard
ner candidacy in this county, while
neither of the other candidates have
selected managers. The race now
seems to be between Gardner and
Roach.
Republican leaders are divided be
tween Judge Lamm and John E. Swan
ger, but Charles D. Morris, the St.
Joseph editor, has many followers.
Hugh Mclndoe of Joplin has not shown
any strength in this county.
Edward D. Hays, Probate Judge,
will get the Republican nomination for
Circuit Judge without opposition. He
is probabl the best known Republican
in this judicial district and will be a
hard canddate to defeat. Judge
Frank P. Kelly, the present incum
bent, is a candidate for re-election,
and will not have any opposition, his
friends say, although it is said his
strength has slumped during the past
month.
Orren Wilson has announced his
candidacy for the Republican nomina
tion for State Senator. Harry E.
Alexander is seeking the nomination
on the Democratic side.
Fred H. Schrader, deputy County
Clerk and City Assessor of Jackson,
is opposing Otto F. Willa of Gordon
ville for the Republican nomination
for County Assessor. Henry P. Gaines
of this city is the only candidate men
tioned for the nomination on the Dem
ocratic side of the fence.
J. Henry Caruthers will have no
opposition for the Republican nomina
tion for Prosecuting Attorney. L. L.
Bowman has declined to become the
Democratic nominee, and Russell
Dearmont has been drafted in his
stead.
Henry Brinkopf has a clear field tc
date for the; Republican nomination
for Sheriff. William F. Schade is the
Democratic candidate for this office.
It i3 reporteel that Chief of Police
Hutson of this city may enter the
Democratic nice for the nomination,
but politician say he would have no
chance against Schade.

GIRL, 10, FALLS
FROM TREE,BRAIN
HAS CONCUSSION
Ermine Chappius May Have
Fatal Injury Skull Pro
bably Fractured.
CLIMBED TREE TO GET
KITE FOR BOY FRIENDS
Hit
Playmate in Fall, Struck
Ground on Bark and
Shoulder.
Ten-year-old Ermine Chappius, a
daughter of Vincent Chappius, a car
penter living at 415 North Main street,
suffered injuries last night which may
provo fatal when she fell 25 feet out
of a tree into which she had climbed
to get a kite for some boys with whom
she had been playing.
The child sustained a concussion of
the brain and probably a fracture of
the skull at the base of the brain.
The boys for whom she was doing the
climbing fled from their play-mate's
side after she had fallen.
She was picked up unconscious by
her father, who witnessed the fall. He
carried her into their home nearby
and began working over his daughter
in an effort to restore her to con
sciousness. When his efforts were ineffectual
he sent for Father Walsh of St. Vin
cent's College, and at the same time
Dr. R. P. Dalton was summoned.
The doctor succeeded in reviving the
child and worked for several minutes
to save her life. Her condition was
considered very critical last night.
The child had been playing with a
brother and a sister, Ralph and Flora
Chappius, as well as Edna Woods, 5
years old, and Marys Woods, who live
in the same house with the Chappius
family.
The five children met some strange
boys on top of the hill in the rear of
their home and within a short distance
of the home of J. G. Reynolds, on
Bellevne Heights. The boys had man
aged to get their kite caught in a tree
which stands on the brow of the hill
and they urged the Chappius girl to
go after it for them.
She had clambered high in the
branches of the tree and was working
her way out toward the place where
the kite had become fastened. Her
father, returning home from his work
at about that time, happened to see
his daughter clinging to the small
limbs of the tree. He called to her
to gel out of the tree at once. The
little girl obeyed her father, and with
out having reached the kite she began
making her descent. After she had
taken a couple of steps toward the
ground the missed her footing and
fell.
The father and Mrs. Ida Woods saw
the child fall from the upper branches
of the tree. The smaller children be
neath were helpless to aid her. As she
fell she struck Edna Woods a glancing
blow across the shoulders and the con
tact with the Woods child turned the
Chappius girl in the air so that she
landed flat on her back, striking her
head and right shoulder heavily on the
ground.
The Woods girl was unhurt from the
blow she had received in her compan
ion's fall. The Chappius girl, how
ever, sustained severe bruises on the
right shoulder in addition to the con
cussion of the brain and the probable
fracture of the skull.

GROWN-UPS WILL
BE GIRLS AGAIN
Maids and Young Matrons to
Play Like They Used to Before
They Had Beaux.
The girls of tiie D. Y. B. C "Don't
You Boys Come," or "Do Your Best
I Club" Saturday night vjill have a
reunion at the home of Miss Clara
Miller, 222 Bellevue street, after hav
ing been disbanded for more than five
years.
The D. Y. B. C. was a girls' secret
older that existed several years, held
meetings, had initiations, dances, tea
parties, taffy-pulling partise, goblin
parties, lawn parties, and many other
society entertainments.
The members were about two dozen
strong and all were pupils in the pub
lic schools of this city. They were not
old enough to be debutantes and as s
consequence gave little heed to the
warning nignified by the nickname of
their order "Don't You Boys Come."
Tiieir social affairs were the talk
of the town for days before and after
they were held.
When a few of the members who
now have grown up, discussed the so
ciety of the club days, a canvass of
the membership disclosed that a ma
jority of the original members now
are in the Cape. Many have done
their "best" and are married. Others
siili are trying.
Anyway, it was decided to have a
reunion which is to be as nearly as
possible an exact duplicate of their
old-time meetings.
Mrs. Louise Vasterling-Himinelber-ger
will read a paper, and recitations
and songs by other members of the
club will be features of the program.
Those who are members of the re
vived order are: Elizabeth Davis. Mrs.
Fred Wood, Marie Patton, Mrs. Elmer
Blaine, Mrs. Linnette Ross-Reary,
Berta Wilson, Viola Luckey, Evalyn
Chenue, Edith and Edna Sebastian,
Irma Huters, Norma Regenhardt, Sa
rah Weber, Mrs. William Bryan, Hel
en Yogelsanger, Mrs. Garrett Glenn,
Mrs. Ruth Hall, in addition to Mrs.
Himmelberger and Miss Miller.
The organization existed for a long
time and the order selected a pin made
of a four-leaf clover done in gold, each
petal of the clover bearing one of the
initials of the club's name.
The name of the organization has
been guarded with such strict secrecy
that when it was active the members
of the organization used to journey
far into the country in order to obtain
complete secrecy before imparting the
name to their neophytes.
The road has been oiled once as far
as the Seven Mile hill by money fur
nished in the Cape. Last fall when
the oil was applied several motorists
complained of the oil treatment of the
highway on account of tire trouble,
which they traced to the oil surface.

PAIR TIGERS ESCAPE
ZOO AT CITY PARK
Kage Bickers With Trapper But
Fails to Get Price-Leoffel
After Swans.
Mayor Kage yesterday afternoon
was of the opinion he vjas on the trial
of a pair of Nortb A nerican. tigers
for the Fairgrounds Park Zoo.
Only his failure to extract a price
from the trapper who offered them for
i:ule inteirened and prevented the
Mayor from acquiring the beasts.
After bickering for several minutes in
an endeavor to get a price, the Mayor
was forced to abandon the project.
Mr. Kage was inspecting his gar
den on Broadway yesterday afternoon
when tiie trapper approached him.
The man had a trapper's look in his
right eye. His left eye had been
destroyed.
"Do you take care of the Zoo ani
mals here?" he queried.
"Yes; what have you got?" the ex
ecutive countered.
"Pair of catamounts."
Th2 Mayor determined that if it
were possible, the acquisition of the
catamounts would be a signal move for
the Zoo. Catamounts, he remembered,
are North American tigers or pumas
and are genuine wild animals. If they
could be properly housed in Fair
grounds park and cared for, the Mayor
reflected that not only people from all
parts of the Cape would flock to see
them on the first Sunday. they were
placed on exhibition, but that entire
Southeast Missouri would become in
terested in the Zoo.
The trapper explained that he had
put the two specimens in captivity
after a hard fight near his home at
Bernie, Stoddard County.
"How much?" queried the Mayor
next.
"Oh, I don't know. What'll you
give?" the trapper became wary.
"I can't buy and sell both," the ex
ecutive replied. And thereafter fol
lowed a series of cross-questions and
answers in which the Mayor sought a
price on the wild animals; but the
trapper studiously avoided coming to
terms.
The man with the single eagle eye
slapned his knee and pointed at his
toes as he walked away.
Mayor Kage yesterday evening an
nounced that he intends to make a
second personal trip to St. Louis, ac
companied by members of the City
Council who wish to join him, seeking
information on how to arrange for and
care of animals in zoos.
The Mayor will go to the zoo de
partment in Forest Park in St. Louis
and there view the manner in which
the wild animals deer, bison, ele
phant, monkies and birdsare housed.
The birds in St. Louis are enclosed
within a cage large enough to cover
a two-ring circus tent. -

Mrs. Look had suffered a slight
attack of illness about three or four
weeks ago. She recovered, however,
anil Tuesday her relatives believed she
was still strong. She had spent part
of the morning sitting on the front
and rear porches at the Stein home,
and in the afternoon inspected some
new windows at 37 South Sprigg

SAYS HE DID NOT
VIOLATE THE LAW
Commissioer Kage Releases
Physician on Bond of $1000
- Trial in October.
Dr. A. n. Allstun of Denton, a small
place six miles west of Steele, Mo.,
the second Southeast Missouri doctor
to bo indicted by t!i( April Federal
Grand Jurv for a violation of the Hai
risen anti-narcotu- drug act, was ar
rested yesterday and brought to this
citv bv L S. DM)utv Marshal George
C. Ochard.
Dr. Allstun was taken before U. S.
Commissioner Kage. where he fur
nished a bond of SI 000 for his appear
ance in the United States District
Court in October. The doctor's bond
was signed by A. B. Denton, a farmer
living close to Allstun'.-- place, who
i accompanied him to the Cape. They
departed for their homes last night.
In the indictment that v

having dispensed morphine without
having made the proper registry of
his operations with the Federal auth
orities. Wl'en the Harrison anti-narcotic
drug law went into effect it became
necesary for all physicians handling
prescriptions for it. or in any way
making it possible for an individual
patient to get the stuff to register in
the Internal Revenue Department.
The law went into effect March
191."). At that time physicians regis-'
tered, but their registry was good fori
only the remainder of the govern- ;
ment's fiscal year, or until June ."0.
On July 1 of last year it became
necessary for physicians to register
again.
Dr. Allstun registered properly the
lirst time, but failed to register at the
expiration of the period. He contin
ued to is.Mie prescriptions for "dope."
however, the investigation of Frank
T. Digges, deputy Collector of the In
ternal Revenue, discovered, and as a
consequence he violated the laws.
Digges' investigation disclosed that
the doctor had issued prescriptions for
a dram of morphine to Mamie Miles
of C aruthersvi'.le last Augu.-.t. In
issuing the prescriptions he used the
old registry number, Digges declares.
When Dr. Allstun was brought to
the Cape and taken before U. S. Com
missioner Kage for his bond, he de
clared that he was at a loss to know
in what manner he had violated tiie
Harrison law.
He departed, saying that he intended
to end to St. Louis for a copy of his
indictment to learn how he broke the
law.
Dr. B. L. Ellis of Poplar BIufT was
brought to the Cape last Sunday by
Orchard, charged with not having kept
proper account of the distribution of
a large supply of morphine sulphate.
He also gave bond.
