HOLBROOK, NAVAJO COUNTY, ARIZONA, FRIDAY, MAY 12, 1916.
G. M. BRAXTON, Proprietor.
Vol. 8. No. 2.
LAND RESTORED TO ENTRY
Vast Body of Government Land,
Most of It in Navajo County,
Will be open for Homestead
Entry June 26 Influx of Set
tlers Certain.
Restoration of approximately
400.000 acres of land, lying along
the Little Colorado river, to set
tlement and entry, indicates that
the government has abandoned
the proposed Little Colorado
river irrigation project. The
land was withdrawn from entry
under an order issued Nov. 18.
1904. under the same form of
withdrawal as the Salt river
project.
Under advices received by The
News early this week from the
Phoenix land office the land will
hp onen for settlement on June
26 and for filing and entry on Ju
ly 26 following, thirty days later.
Those endeavoring to make set
tlement prior to the date men
tioned for the purpose of acquir
ing title to the land will be treat
ed as trespassers.
Parties can go on the land for
the purpose of examining it
prior to that date and parties
who may have settled on it or
otherwise acquired rights prior
to withdrawal will also be per
mitted on it, without being con
sidered trespassers.
The land in question extends
along both sid√©s of the Little
Colorado river from Carrizo
creek, east of Holbrook twelve
miles, to a point about eighteen
miles west of Wins low or for a
distance of nearly eighty miles
in length and eight townships
in width, nearly fifty miles.
It includes fourteen full and
five fractional townships extend
ing from and including township
fifteen north, to and including
twenty-two north, and ranges
from twelve to and including
twenty-three east. The little
town of St. Joseph, where a
small irrigation system is in
operation, is embraced in the
area, thoutrh not included in the
lands which have been restored
for entry.
A portion of the land perhaps
might be irrigated by private
ditches but the greater portion
would be valuable only under a
general irrigation project.
The restoration to homestead
entry of this vast body of land
will be of inestimable benefit
to Holbrook and other sections
of Navajo county. Much of this
land is good agricultural land
and is suitable for growing croDS
bv dry farming methods. This
land will be quickly entered by
homesteaders, and the popula
tion of the county will be great
ly increased.
Along the Little Colora o river
and tributary streams'there are
a number of good reservoir sites
which may be developed, either
by private capital, or under dis
trict irrigation plans, and by
this means land in the valleys
may be irrigated.
It's true that a considerable
portion of the land restored to
entry is suitable only for graz
ing purposes, but with the pass
age of the 640-acre homestead
law now before congress which
seems certain of enactment
this class of land will also be
homesteaded.
Altogether, the prospect is
good for a large increase in the
population of the county as a re
sult of these lands becoming
available for entry as home
steads. An increase in popula
tion will benefit every communi
ty in the county, and every in
dividual as well.
To use a popular expression:
"We should worrv!"
Alleged Bootleggers Caught
As a result of the activities of
the sheriff's office during the
last week, the county bastile is
rapidly filling up with alleged
violaters of the prohibition law.
One resident of Holbrook,
Henry Kruithoff, charged will
illigally selling whiskey, was ar
raigned before Judge Boyer
Monday morning. He waived
examination and was bound over
to the superior court, his bond
being fixed at $500. Being un
able to furnish bond, he is in
jail.
Tuesday morning four resi
dents of Winslow were arraigned
befere Judge Boyer. information
being sworn to by Deputy
Sheriff Harp. These men were
Len Wilson. Tom Meyers. Tom
Reed and Bob Johnson. All
four took 24 hours
to plead, and Wednesday morn
inc waived examination. Each
was bound over to the superior
court, the bonds being fixed at
$500 in each case. The four are
now boarders at the hotel man
aged by Undersheriff Clemons.
Since the decision of the su
nreme court in reference to the
personal use of intoxicating li
quor, the business of bootleg
ging seems to have grown thru
out the state. It has ' cer
tainly become more prevalent in
Navajo county. Because of that
decision convictions in courts are
harder to secure, and more peo
ple than ever before are engag
ed in the illegal traffic.
The Arizona prohibitory law
should be repealed or it should
be so amended as to permit
sheriffs and other peace officers
to enter and search premises in
which they have reasons to sup
pose liquor is concealed. Under
the present law, they
have no right to search a place
for intoxicants even though they
may be morally certain that it
contains contraband; they must
first secure direct evidence that
the liquor is being disposed
of illegally a thing in many
case impossible to do.
The result is that, be the offi
cers ever so vigilant, and the
courts disposed to impose the
maximum penalty, the illegal
traffic continues. Moreover, a
villlanous brand of liquor is sold
by irresponsile men to any per
son who can raise the price; a
brand of liquor that if used li
berally would totally incapacitate
a person, not only to walk
straight, but to think straight.
Therefore we say the prohibi
tion law should be amended so
as to resemble something more
than a joke, or it should be re
pealed. Less drunkeness will
exist with open saloons than un
der the present condition. There
will also be less crime, if those
persons who will drink can se
cure a brand of liquor that will
not incite them to commit every
crime on the calendar.
Will Not Be Candidate
Asked bv the editor of the
News one day this week as to
the probability of his being a
candidate for reelection, County
Attorney Jordan stated that un
der no circumstances would he
accept a renomination.
In the first place, he stated,
the duties of the office of county
attorney are such that they in
terfere greatly with his private
law private. In the second
place, his agreement with the
stockholders of the Navajo
Apache Bank & Trust company,
when he accepted the position of
liquidating agent, was that he
should remain out of office after
his present term expired until
the business of the corporation
is settled. As two or three years
will be required to settle this
business, it is certain that dur
ing this time Mr. Jordan will not
be a candidate for any county
office.
Mr. Jordan gave permission to
the editor of The News to quote
him as above stated, for the rea
son that his friends, and the
voters generally, might know
his position. He does not wish
his friends to rest under the im
pression that he would accept a
renomination to the county-at-torneyship
if urged to do so.
Neither does he wish any other
person who might be a candidate
to refrain from announcing his
candidacy beeause of any uncer
tainty as to his (Mr. Jordan's)
intention.
Holbrook Wallops Winslow Again
The Holbrook base ball club
journeyed to Winslow last Sun
day and again walloped the
Winslow club in the great Amer
ican game. Score 16 to 8.
The contest was witnessed by
a large number of people, many
of whom were from Holbrook.
Early in the game the Holbrook
fans threw away their mega
phones and other rooting im
plements, evidently not wishing
to make the certain defeat of
the Winslow club more painful
than necessary. From that time
on the grandstand maintained a
funeral aspect the Winslow
oeoDle finding nothing in the
play of their club to shout for,
and possibly being too sick to
notice the good playing of the
Holbrook club.
Defeating the Winslow club
is getting to be a habit with the
Holbrook club. The Winslow
club has some men in it who
might be hammered into ball
players by hard work but they
need a lot of practice before
they are entitled to play in the
same class as the Holbrook play
ers. When two clubs are so un
evenly matched in skill, it is
difficult to get up interest in a
contest between them. Another
game between these two clubs
would not draw very heavy gate
receipts.
In last Sundays' game, the
Holbrook club went first to bat
and in the first inning made
eight tallies. When the Wins
low club came to bat in the same
inning, the players seemed to be
greatly disheartened, and as
their men went down in one,
two, three order, the agony be
came more pronounced, iney
seemed to realize that the Hol
brook players had their numbers,
and it was only a question of
how bad the defeat would be at
the finish.
The Holbrook boys realized
that the game was won in the
first inning, and in the balance
of the innings they simply play
ed to hold the lead they had won
in the first inning.
Pitcher Osborne, who had in
jured the middle finger of his
right hand a few days before,
stayed in the box through the
sixth inning, when he was re
lieved by substitute pitcher, H.
O. Carpenter.
The Holbrook batters found
but little difficulty in hitting the
Winslow pitchers, and every man
did his duty at the bat, as well
as in the field.
A game for next Sunday after
noon in Holbrook has been ar
ranged by manager Kunkle.
The local club will play the St.
Johns club, which is said to be
a good one. Game will be called
at 4 o clock in the afternoon.
