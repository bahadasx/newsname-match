BAKER GALLS
FUNSTONAND
SCOTT BACK
Gives Order on Receipt of
Report Regarding Failure
of Agreement.
UNWRITTEN POLICY?
Is Intimated an 'Under
standing" for Coopera
tion Is Reached.
Washington. May 1'i-The state
department received word late to
day that .eneral Trevino had or
dered liiHt Carranza cavalry and
infantry toward the border to pur
sne the bandits responsible for the
recent raids at Glenn Springs and
lloqnillas, Texas.
Washington. May li-Fpon re.
cem'ng word today from Maior
General Hugh Scott that the bor
der conferences with General
tlhregon had heen closed withont
agreement. Secretary Baker an
nonnced that he had directed
General Scott to return to Wash-ins-Ion
and General Funston to
return to his headquarters at San
Antonio, Texas.
General Scott's report was in ampli
fication of the official statement is
sued by the conferees at El Paso last
night, which was transmitted to Sec
retary Lansing and also was consid
ered at the cabinet meeting. Its con
tents were not disclosed but there were
some indications of an unwritten
agreement having been formulated to
cover cooperative action along the
border for the present.
Written Acreemont Fails.
Secretary Baker said the conferees
had tried to reach a basis for a writ
ten agreement but found it impos
sible, although all interchanges were
of the most friendly character.
It was suggested that General Car
ranza, faced by the political situation
in Mexico, was nnwilling to make any
written agreement to which his op
ponents could point as indicating a
surrender of sovereign rights. Under
that theory, General Obregon, it is
understood, has given assurances that
every possible means will be employed
by his government to aid in the
speedy extermination of the bandits
while the formal diplomatic discus
sion of the withdrawal suggestion
proceeds. It is possible that neither
side will endeavor to force the nego
tiations while the disturbed condi
tion along the border continues.
.o More Troops Needed.
Before going to the cabinet meet
ing. Secretary Baker said no steps
to send additional national guards
men or regulars to the border were
in immediate contemplation. It was
made plain, however, that should
General Funston again find his bor
der guard too thin to protect Amer
ican towns and ranches, there would
be no hesitation in calling out more
state troops. So far, however, it was
said, not even preliminary steps in
this direction have been taken.
General Funston returns to San An
tonio with his original orders altered
in do way. He has full authority to
dispose his men either in Mexico or
along the border.
Arndondo Awaits Orders,
Kliseo Arredondo, General Carran
za's ambassador, said diplomatic ne
gotiations would not be resumed un
til he had been instructed. It was
thought probable General Carranza
would communicate to him the result
of tbe border conference.
Belief was expressed at the Mexi
can embassy that Generals Scott,
Funston and Obregon were in accord
on several mportant subjects when
the conference was concluded. It was
indicated that the effect of the con
ference would be shown in the future
operations of American and Mexican
forces against outlaws, although no
written agreement had resulted.
Goethals to Itecign Panama Job?
Washington, May 11 Secretary
Baker said today he had no advices
from Panama- to confirm reports that
Governor Goethals plans to resign
June 1. General Goethals, however,
has a Unit agreement with the war de
partment for his retirement when the
removal of the canal slides are com
pleted. He proposed his retirement
when the slides occurred last fall.

REAL WAR LORD NOW
IS VON FALKENHAYN
Uf v.
Eric von Falkenhayn as sketched by
Karl Bauer, the German artist.
London, May 12. Eric von Falken
hayn is the brains of the German army.
The "military domination of Prus
sia," which Mr. Asuith declared must
be "wholly and finally destroyed," has
its seat and center in the famous
"generalstabler," which is quite an ex
ceptional theocracy of war. "In peace
time," says Ignatius Phayre. "the Ber
lin 'kriegsministerium, on the Konigs
platz, near the Austrian embassy, is
much like any other war office. But
the moment mobilization is complete,
and before the first gun is fired, the
real war thinkers hurry out to the
field and throw off every vestige of
civil authority even that of the im
perial throne itself.
"The kaiser is 'invited' to grand
headquarters at Thielt, in Flanders, or
Verdun, in France, when big attacks
are to be made, hut the emperor is
only a visitor. Ho is now all-highest
in name alone, for tho real war lord
is Eric von Falkenhayn, chief of staff
of the German armies and directing
brain of all the others from the Bal
kans to Bagdad."
KAISER HONORS
CAPTAIN BOY-ED
London, May 12. A Central News
dispatch from Amsterdam says that
Captain Karl Boy-ed, former German
naval attache at Washington, has been
decorated with the order of the Red
Eagle, third class, with swords, by the
emperor.
Captain Boy-ed was appointed to '''t
Washington embassy in Deo Jr
1911. After various charges
been made against him in rega.
hia connection with passports frauds,
the equipment of German commerce
raiders from this country and Ger
man intrigues in Mexico, President
Wilson requested his recall. After the
president had declined a request from
Berlin to explain the reasons for the
demand for Captain Boy-ed's recall,
the attache was ordered home last
December.
The charges against Captain Boy-ed
continued after his departure from
this country. In March of this year,
when Horst von der Goltz was ar
rested in New York in connection
with the plot to blow up the Welland
canal in Canada, he made a state
ment to the United States district at
torney charging that Captain Boy-ed
had proposed an invasion of Canada
from this country.
APPAM NOTICE IS
GIVEN BY JUDGE
Norfolk, Va., May 12. When the!
proceedings to determine possession
of the captured British liner Appam,
brought as a German prize to this
port were begun in federal court here
today, Judge Waddill, over the protest
of the counsel for the German em
bassy, made public for the first time
the state department's communication
of March 2 to Count von Bernstorff.
It disclosed that the department
considered the case one involving le
gal questions to be decided by the
courts and contrary to what has here
tofore been generally understood, ex
pressed the view that the Appam did
not fall within the protecting clauses
of the Prussian-American treaty. It
pointed out that the treaty granted
asylum for vessels of war accompany
ing prizes but does not protect these
perils of war deposited in an Amer
ican port.
GET MONEY FIGHTING
THE WHITE PLAGUE
Washington, May 12. Direct finan
cial economy of combatting tubercu
losis was illustrated today at final ses
sions of the National Association for
the Study and Prevention of Tuber
culosis. Dr. Joseph H. Pratt of Boston, ex
plained that patients of a tuberculosis
class maintained by Emanuel church.
Boston, whose wage earning power
was restored by proper treatment,
earned $50,000 last year. The total
expense of the class for the past JO
years was about 15,000. Dr. Pratt
recommended that churches and other
organizations form classes of tuber
culosis patients for instruction regard
ing outdoor treatment, which they may
give themselves at home.

Two Attempts of Germans
to Recapture Positions
Lost Are Futile.
AT DEAD MAN'S HILL
Action Along Western Slope
Douaumont-Vaux Sec
tion Bombarded.
Paris, May 12, fll:0 a. m.1 Two at
tempts by the Germans last night to
recapture positions on the western
slope of Dead Man's Hill, taken by the
French on May 10, were frustrated
by the French artillery fire. Artillery
is active about the Avocourt wood and
the bombardment in the Douaumont
Vaux section continues, according to
the official war office report issued to
day. The text of the statement follows:
"On the left bank of the Meuse
(Verdun front), there was" intense ar
tillery activity from the sector of the
wood of Avocourt to Dead Man's Hill.
The Germans vainly attempted to dis
lodge us during the night from the
positions we captured May 10 on the
western slope of the hill. Two suc
cessive attacks were repulsed by our
fire.
"On the right bank the bombard
ment in the region of Douaumont
Vaux continued.
Give Keason of Vcrdnn Fight.
Senator Berenger, writing in today's
Matin, says that the key to the war
lies in the possession of the Briey
valley between Verdun and Metx.
"Since the war began," says Sen
ator Barenger, 'Trance, having lost
the Briey basin, has been obliged to
import almost all the iron required
from England and America, while
Germany, having occupied the whole
Briey valley is able to add 21,000.000
tons to her own annual output. This
explains the assiduity of the Germans
at Verdun. They want to capture
the fortress so as effectually to pre
vent the French from attacking Metz."
German War Report.
Berlin, May 12. (by wireless to Say
ville.) The text of today's statement
by German armv, headquarters is as
follows:
"Western front, southeast of the
Hohenzollern redoubt near Hulluch,
German battalions from the Palatinate
yesterday stormed several lines of a
British position. Up to this time 127
unwounded prisoners have been
brought in. Several machine guns
were taken. The enemy suffered
heavy losses, especially during a fu
tile counter attack.
"In the Argonne the French attack
ed La Fille Morte, using flame throw
ers. The attack failed.
"In the Meuse district there has been
lively artillery fire by both sides. Aside
from a feeble attempt by the French
in the Thiaumont wood there has been
no important infantry action.

IsBlamed for
Irish Revolt
Dublin, May 12, (via London,
:1S p. m.) James Connolly and
John McDermott were shot this
morning1 for complicity in the re
hellion. San Francisco, May 12. "The Lead
er," an Irish publication here, prints
today a purported copy of a document
alleged to have been issued secretly by
the British government and the dis
covery of which is said to have pre
cipitated the recent revolution in Ire
land. According to 'The Leader," the doc
ument fell into the hands of Tom
Kelly, a Dublin alderman, who read it
at a special meeting of the city cor
poration the Wednesday evening pre
ceding the riots. The exposure of the
government's pU.n of preparedness,
according to the "Leader" was the
signal for the uprising.
The document, according to the al
leged copy, had "the sanction of the
Irish office on the recommendation of
the general office commanding the
forces in Ireland."
It directs, that on receipts of an
order issued from the chief secretary's
office, Dublin castle, and signed by the
under-serretary and the general offi
cer, certain measures be put in force
immediately.
These measures included tbe arrest
of all members of the Sinn Fein na
tional council, the central executive
Sinn Fein volunteers, general council
Irish Sinn Fein volunteer, county
board Irish Snn Fein volunteers,
executive committee national volun
teers and the Coisde Gnotha commit
tee Gelic league. The alleged docu
ment directed that the Dublin metro
politan police and the royal Irish con
stabulary forces in Dublin be confined
to barracks; that provision be made
to notify inhabitants to remain in
doors, "until such time as competent
military authority may otherwise di
rect or permit," and gave directions
for military occupation of certain
premises throughout the city.
Dublin, May 12, (via London, 9:36
a. m.) Premier Asquith arrived in
Dublin today and was taken in an
automobile to the vice-regal lodge.
The premier's program for the day
was first a conference with depart
mental chiefs and afterward consul
tation with General Maxwell in regard
to the military situation, which is well
in hand.
It is reported that in all likelihood,
a proclamation will be issued shortly
abolishing martial law, the provis
ions of which have been greatly modi
fied in the last few days.
The situation in some parts of the
provinces is said to be still rather
disturbed and it is likely that mili
tary control will continue in these
districts for some time longer.
Premier Asquith intended also to
meet several civilian deputations so
as to learn at first hand their ideas
concerning the reconstruction of the
destroyed portions of Dublin and per
haps to formulate a plan for com
pensation. There is relief apparent
among the population at tne prom
cessation of executions which were
beginning to cause considerable agi
tation. NEGRO KILLS

Leavenworth, Kas., May 12. Ser
geant James C. Jackson and Miss Er
nestine Brown, 22 years old, were
killed and an unidentified woman was
severely wounded this morning by
William White, a negro, who had pur
chased his release from the army
rtounted service school at rort Ieav-

escaped across the Missouri river m
a row boat.
Sergeant Jackson, who was attached
to the mounted service school was
killed at the school's stables. He was
shot through the heart
Soldiers who were with him gave
chase at once but they carried only
side arms and White held them at bay
with a high powered rifle until he got
into a row boat he had hidden on the
river bank. Their shots missed him
and it is believed he crossed the Mis
souri river unharmed.
White first shot the unidentified
woman who is known only as "Min-j

dow in the home where she was em
ployed, about 6 o'clock. She was shot
through the arm.
Miss Brown, whom he killed, was
shot nearly two hours later at the
quarters of Lieutenant William Green,
where she was at work. He likewise
shot at her through a window. Fif
teen minutes later he appeared at the
service school. White, according to
authorities, closed up his affairs yes
terday. He purchased his release from
the service school and left instruc
tions with an attorney that his life in
surance policy should he collected and
the proceeds sent to hia mother In

BERLIN SAYS
Passenger Steamer Dubrov-

Subsea Craft.
NOT WARNED, CLAIM
German Statement in Ad
mitting Sinking Says
Vessel Unarmed.
Berlin, May 12, fby wireless to
Sayville, . I.) "The Austro
Hungarian passenger steamer Du
brovnik has been torpedoed and
sunk by an enemy submarine in
the Adriatic.'
The Dubrovnik was not armed
and was torpedoed without any
warning whatever," says a semi
official news agency.
The dispatch does not state that any
passengers were on board at the time
of the torpedoing and it seems prob
able that she was in the government
service, as so far is known, no Aus
trian steamers have been engaged in
passenger traffic in the Adriatic or
elsewhere since the early days of the
war.
In this connection it is noted that
in a Paris news agency dispatch of
May 10 the sinking in the lower Adri
atic of "an enemy transport laden with
war material" was announced.
The Dubrovnik was a vessel of 4,
326 tons gross, built in Nerwcastle in
1912. Marine registers reported her
last at Constantinople.
Comment on Admission.
Paris, May 12 The official admis
sion that a German submarine torpe
doed the Sussex is widely commented
on in today's press which considers
that the admission accentuates Ger
many's collapse before President Wil
son's resolute attitude.
The Petit Parisien says that an ex
amination of the comments of the Ger
man press shows that it is dominated
by the feeling that Germany has un
dergone one of tbe gravest diplomatic
checks in her history and that she
does not answer back to Washington
as she would like.
See Wilson's Power.
Petrograd, May 12. The press con
tinues to comment on the surrender
of Germany to the demands of the
United States. Some of the papers
draw a comparison between the firm
attitude of President Wilson and wha
they describe as the desire of the "rep
resentatives of American science, pol
itics, laws and church" for the event
ual triumph of the allies. American
public feeling is declared to be the
best antidote for the two years of Ger
man agitation in tbe United States.
Copenhagen, May 12. According to
the Berlin Tageblatt Germany will not
send a reply to the last American note
but the German government will con

$500,000 BLAZE
HITS OHIO TOWN
Sandusky, Ohio, May 12, Fire here
today in the business district did
$500,000 damage.
The tire started from an unknown
cause in the Wasner livery barn at
the rear of Market street and con
sumed the building so rapidly that it
was with difficulty that the horses
were saved.
A strong wind from the southeast
swept the flames into the old four
story Schmidt block at the southeast
corner of Market and Wayne streets.
The top floor fell in and the wind car
ried fire brands from this burning
structure diagonally across the cor
ner to the four story Kuntz block. Loss
on this building was about $200,000
and on goods in the block another
$200,000. The gale made difficult the
work of the firemen, seveAl of whom
were slightly injured.
In the Schmidt block were the Nobil
Shoe store, the J. H. Herman furni
ture store, the Dilgert and Bitner fur
niture store, the Healy clothing store,
F. E. Swayne's piano store and the
Bowser and Sharp carpet store. The
first three of these establishments
were consumed and the others appear
doomed. Fire in the Kuntz block was
put out without great damage.
Subsiding of the high wind probably
was all that saved the business dis
trict of this city from entire destruc
tion. The fire burned out 13 large
stores and a number of smaller estab
lishments. Local Men Granted Patents.

New York, May 12. Samuel S.
McCluxe, the publisher, who arrived
from Copenhagen last night pfl,4he
steamer Oscar II, said that he found
a sentiment for peace only In Ger
many and Austria.
"I have visited all the belligerent
nations and did not find a suggestion
of peace anywhere except in those
two countries, where the people de
sire it for commercial reasons only,"
said Mr. McClure, "by that I mean
they wish to resume their business
relations with other nations, not that
they fear defeat.
"The English, French. Russians.
Belgians, Italians, Germans, Austrians,
Hungarians, Bulgarians and Turks are
all confident of victory for their re

THE WAR TODAY
Hard fighting has been resumed
in the vicinity of lead Man's Hill
on the Verdun front, the Germans
making another attempt to dis
lodge the French from the hill, the
capture of which on May 10, was
reported by the Paris war office.
Two attacks last nighl ere re
pulsed by the French, the war of
fice announced today.
Increase in the violence of the
artillery fire in another sector of
the Verdun front is reported, the
region especially subjected to the
shelling being between Dead Man's
Hill and tbe Avocourt wood, to tbe
southwest. In the Douaumont
Vaux district, east of the Meuse,
the bombardment is being contin
ued. A semi-official dispsvich from
Berlin reports the sinking in the
Adriatic by a hostile submarine of
the Austrian steamer Ituhrovnik
of 4,23V tons. The vessel is char
asterized in the dispatch as a
"passenger steamer"' and it is de
clared she was hot armed and was
sunk without warning.
The most violent bombardment
in the Verdun region is against
the French positions in the Cail
lette wood aud their second lines
on the right bank of the Meuse.
Bombardments hare also taken
place along the front hei1 by the
Belgians and a severe artillery
duel is in progress around the
Hohenzollern redoubt between
the British and Germans. Infantry
actions around Verdun have been
on a small scale.
On the eastern front the Rus
sians and Germans are engaged
in artillery duels at various points
and the same conditions prevail
along the Italian. Austrian front.
In the Caucasus region around
Mount Kope, the Turks claim to
have drhen the Russians from
their positions about nine miles
in extent, and forced them to re
treat eastward.
British Premier Asquith has
gone to Dublin to study the sit

Washington. May 12. Secretary
Baker announced after today's
cabinet meeting that no change in
the Mexican policy had been de
cided upon. 'o new orders for
militia organizations to go to the
border were in contemplation, he
said, and indicated that no gen
eral intervention in Mexico was
being thought of at present
Renewed indications were gtven.
that the administration has no inten
tion of withdrawing American troops
until it is definitely established that
the danger of further border raids has
been removed. The president will
take no further steps until General
Scott returns from the border. The
administration considers the next
move up to General Carranza.
In the meantime American troops
will be so arranged that they will bo
ready to meet any eventualities and.
protect the American border.
Mexican Troops Ordered.
El Paso, May 12. Juan N. Amador,
sub-secretary of foreign affairs of the
de facto government, who participated
in the conference with General Obre
gon, called on General Scott today and
reiterated to him that such troop dis
positions as were necessary to restore
and maintain order along the northern,
frontier already had been ordered.
General Obregon, who will remain
for a few days at Chihuahua, has di
rected General TTevino to send into
the states of Chihuahua and Coahuila
10,000 men. These forces will be tak
en from Torreon, San Pedro and other
points in the southern part of Coa
huila. Trevino's headquarters will be
in Chihuahua City, Chihuahua.
W III Chase Bandits.
Immediate occupation of the district
about Parral has been ordered and
what the Mexicans regard as an ade
quate force will be dispatched to the
Big Bend country and every effort
made to run down the bandits and res
cue J. Deemer, who was captured in
the Glenn Springs and Boquillas raid.
Mr. Amador expected to leave to
night for Mexico City, where he will
have an important role as sub-secre
tary of foreign affairs in the negotia
tions that have reverted to the foreign
officers of the two governments. To.
newspaper men he insisted he had no
doubt of an early and amicable ad.
justment.
Mr. Amador made it clear that Gen
erals Scott and Funston had reiterated
the assertions of the administration
that it was not the intention of the
United States government to keep the
troops in Mexico indefinitely and that
therefore, he did not attach so much
importance to this as had been given
to it in some quarters.
