MENTS FOR IRON COUNTY
J. P. O'Ncil, Who !h Best posted Man
Yet on Ground, Tnkes Proposition
lo Financial Center.
i
j F- O'Ncil, to whom the principal
' ' honor is due for the discovery of the
extensive potash beds in this county,
has sold a small portion of his hold
ings, and last Tuesday started to New
York City to interest sufficient cap
ital in the proposition to insure its
succesful operation upon,a scale com
', mensurato with its size' and impor
tance. Mr. O'Neil now owns two
fifths of the original group of 20
claims located by him. It is under
stood lhat Mr. O'Neil expects to either
sell the group outright, or organize a
! big company to work the property.
He is perhaps the best posted and
m?j P,r,actIcal man connected
i with tho discoveries, and is in the best
S, position to judge as to the value and
p ment of the deposits. To a represen-
h tative of The Record he stated that
J this was a much bigger und more im-
portant find than the people of this
j. section yet realize. Ho said that with-
out doubt it would mean the constrflc-
I tion of a railroad to the Cedar canyon
I this fall, ns the coal would be required
in the treating of the products, and
u he said it would undoubtedly mean the
ft doubling of our present population
w in the county before another year has
I! passed.
H Mr. O'Neil has been a close student
. ,, of the subject of potash, its value, the
m'iLc available supply, the form of its oc-
currence, by-products, treatment, etc..
i-yo-.- andomes-verv nearly knowing- wha
111 he is talking about in this connection.
-' He stated that the deposits hero were
g. much more extensive than ho had at
1 first believed, and ho did not hesitate
i, to say that the Iron county deposits
1 are the largest and most important
thus far discovered in the world. He
1 stated that heretofore the principal
I supply point had been Germany, and
I that owing to the war this supply had
9 been cut off, and that the U. S. geo-
logical survey had been spending much
R time and money looking for an ade
quate supply in this country, and that
the potash must be had in agriculture
and other industries in large quanti
ties, almost regardless of price.
Mr. O'Neil stated that one could
walk on top of the potash ledge for
a distance of fifttecn miles, extending
from the Little Creek canyon on the
northeast to the Summit mountains
on the southwest. Then thero are the
more recent discoveries east of Cedar
City, which aru possibly even more
extensive than the earlier finds.
It was the opinion of Mr. O'Ncil
that the probable method of working
the deposits would be to drivo a long
tunnel from a dry canyon at the low-
est point of the deposits, for a mile or
more, raising to the surface at a eon
veinent point at which water could bp
procured, either by gravity or pump
ing. The lower end of the tunnel to
be closed with n solid gate and cement
with an outlet at tho bottom and ano-
!,ther at tho top. Tho tunnel would be
'filled with water, which would shortlv
become saturated with the potash
when it would bo drawn off by means
of pipes to evaporating vats in the
valley below, and tho waste material1
would bo liberated from the lower
opening in the gato and deposited in
i tho dry canvon, where they could not
t interfere with tho irrigation Bystcms
and farms in thcvalloy below.
Resemble German Beds.
1 In discussing the formation of the
country in which the deposits are
ound, and contrasting them with tho
'deposits in Germany, Mr. O'Ncil said:
"Tho German deposits of potash
salts underlie the red beds of sand
stone, nnd the same condition exists
.in relation to this strata. Tho moun
tains are covered with a layer of
basalt and mnlapal several hundred
feet thick; underneath this are the
red beds and undornenth them a strat
um of quartzlte conglomerate. Then
a strata of white saline sand-stone.
thenv stratum of quartzlte conglomerate-
'then tho carboniferous sand
stone which is of darker color and a
different texture.
"The strntum of white salino sand
stone lying betweon the two strata of
quartzito conglomorate is tho material
carrying the potaBh, alum, etc. It is
very saline to the taste and disintc-
I grates to powder in a few hours after
being moistened.
j "Numerous caves and cavities have
I collected' much crystallized matter,
alum-like to the taste. This condition
exists everywhere along this stratum
where tho situation was audi that the
rains could not wash out tho material
mentioned.
"Many locations have been made op
this deposit recently, since it became
known It was a source of potash, but
Tj it 1b not a recent discovery by uny
I means bb alum was hauled from hero
I V 9J lZ?t 40 yvwe Ajro oy moro fo
dyeing purposes. The residents of this
section, however, were not familiar
with the constituents of nlum, nnd did
not know potash is sometimes one of
the alkalies contained therein.
"Within the past two years there
have been a number of samples taken
from the lake below Parowan nnd the
mud thereof, which I am informed
showed an average potash constituent
of 10 per cent. Hut apparently no one
was familiar enough wih conditions
surrounding potash deposit to be uble
to trace up tho source of the lake
potash, until recently.
Runs High in Potnsh.
"There has been a number of snm
ples taken from tho strata showing
from 14 to 30 per cent potnsh com
pound, enrrying also lumnin and soda:
and I have no doubt but what nitrates
will be produced in commercial quan
tities from the soda. Thero is a very
large percentage of sulphuric acid con
tained in the deposit, as this also is
one of tho constituents of alum, it is
but natural it should occur.
"Lunt, Cony & Co. hnve a group of
claims covering four of tho smnller
canyons adjacent to Parowan, nnd on
these I have attempted to make an
estimation of the material in sight
from the stratum exposed on three
sides, and I find there nre 310,882,235
tons, which I think will be found con
servative. If this material will vield
10 per cent potnsh salts, there will be
over 30,000,000 tons. And figuring
this product on the market price of tho
salts prior to the war it shows over
one billion dollars worth of potash in
the surface exposure of this group, to
say nothing of the remainder of tho
deposits, as this group covers only a
portion of tho area."
Since Mr. O'Neil gave utterance to
the above, a number of additional dis
coveries have been made, so that thero
seems to be no limit to the quantity
of the material contained in this and
some of the adjoining counties.
It may bo that the average of sand
stone ledges carrying tho values will
run considerably lower in potash than
the estimates made by the discoverer,
but even then, with a material to hand
le which is easily soluble in water,
it can no doubt be handled and tho
values extracted at an immense profit.
CUIWSAMBITION IS
QUICKLY FRUSTRATED
Prospective Rride from Long Distance
Changes Mind at Sight of-"
Would-be Groom.
- -
That matrimonial bureaus and the
advertisements often employed by cu
pid in bringing fond and yenrnin"
hearts together and uniting them ir
the holy bonds of matrimony are not
always successful in their conclusions,
was proven by an incident which came
to light locally within tho past few
days.
A certain widower of Cedar City,
who has been a patron of matrimon
ial bureaus for some years, and whj
has already had ono or two females
here on trial, according to report, suc
ceeded in attracting another prospect,
who arrived on last Friday's auto.
The prospective husband was out of
town at tho time, but returned tho
following day. Tho lady, who gavo
her ago as -11 and stated that she had
been married and had two daughters
now married, appeared to bo a parson
of character and refinement. Upon
meeting her betrothed sho was appar
ently not pleased with the appearances
and prospects, and despite the solic
itations of tho foxyrswnin to remain
for a few days, anyhow, engaged in o
violent spell of weeping and took the
next stage back to Lund, nnd retraced
her -1,000 mile journey back to her
horn in New York state.
Tho lady must have been grossly de
ceived, since she stated that she made
the journey out hero at her own ex
nonso and received no assistance in a
financial way from tho prospective
groom. Sho returned home richer in
experience, but poorer in pocket, and
tho yearning heart of tho expectant
widower remains uncomforted.
OLSEN RECITAL WAS GOOD
B. A. C. Lyceum Course Closes Suc
cessful Season With Pleasing
High Class Numbpr.
The reading recital given as tho
concluding number of the B. A. C.
Lyceum course at the College auditor
ium last Saturday night, fully mot the
expectations of those present, and
rounded out ono of the most success
ful lyceum courses yet given by the
local institution.
Mr. Olson is a polished gentleman
and a scholar. His work as a dramatic
reader and impersonator is finished,
urtistic and clever. His subjects nro
high class, and well chosen, affording
a variety of emotions and sentiments.
In the magic of his spell, the audience
forgets thnt a single reader stands
boforo them, and they see in vivid im
agination the various characters in
the play, moving and speaking in very
Mfe and person.
Those who failed to hear Mr. Olson
missed one of the very best numbers
of tho wintor's course. And tho Ly
ceum course is ono of tho rare educa
tional treats connected with the in
stitution, and a feature that neither
the students nor tho townspeople can
wili affovd. to puss uu.

WILL FORGET ABOUT
SILVER REEF DUMPS
Failure of Residents to Accept Fair
Offer for Holdings Queers Deal
for Extensive Operations.
It is a wise man who knows when
tolet well enough alone. One of the
greatest failings of wo weak mortals
is to let our desires get the better of
our judgment. Because a prominent
man of Leeds wns not willing to take
a good thing when it was offered,
giving the other fellow a chance to
realize something for his time and
investment, it looks probable that he
has not onl shut the door against a
neat little fortune for himself, but
has prevented a nice llttlo booni for
his section of tho country which would
have been a benefit to tho entire re
gion, and might have led to other and
far greater developments.
For some time experiments have
been progressing for the.,purpose of
obtaining a ch'oa'pf'ocessiarjth'c
treatment of tailing dumps from -which
not all the values had been extracted
during the originnl operation, and re
cently some pronounced successes
have been obtained along tills line.
This has led again recently to the
sampling and testing of the old tail
ing dumps at Silver Reef, vhich have
been located by parties of that sec
tion of the country. The investiga
tions appear to have been satisfac
tory, and interests represented by
Quinco K. Kimball, for whom S. A.
Higbee of this city, made an offer of
25 cents per on royalty for tho dumps,
which it is estimated would have net
ted the locators something like $25,
000. Not satisfied to take this offer
for these old dumps which havo been
lying unimproved or used ever since
the demonetization of silver, tho lo
cators insisted upon the company go
ing into tho mnrkot and bidding for
the dumps. The following letter from
Mr. Kimball to his local representa
tive, Is tho sequel:
Salt Lake City, Utah, May 10.
S. A. Higbee, Cedar City, Utah.
Dear Friend. I havo been waiting to
hear from McMullin. Today I received
a letter from him, in which he calls
off the offer you made him. It seems
he wants us to make him a bid along
with others, that ho claims arc be
coming interested. We have too many
good things coming to us now. Wo
will forget the. Silver Reef for tiio
nresent, and let the other fellows
handle tho tnilings."

Quotes from Report Which Shows
Public Utilities Commission of II

Editor Iron County Record, Dear
Sir. In your issue of May 5th you
publish n long nrticle from Mr. V. S.
Peet of Salt Lake City, in which he
tnkes me to task for urging a' Public
Utilities Commission for tho State of
Utnh.
He tells us thnt Iron county has no
utilities nnd wonders why I wish to
Increase Iron county's taxes to nay
for retrulating the utilities of Salt
Lake, Utah, Davis. Weber, Box Elder
and Cache counties where 95 of
them are located.
First, let mo remark that Iron coun
tYn.r.a8 l,c.n l)rivately owned public
utilities, all working hnrmoniously be
tween themselves nnd their pntrons nt
tho present time; thnt Iron, with tho
other "outlving counties." 21 in all.
ran, since they contain only 57r of
the state's utilities, (according to Mr.
Peet) pay 5 of the expenses of the
commission. Second, I see no neces
sity for this expense being paid from
the general tax fund. The tax scheme
Mr. Peet has assumed for tho nurpose
of scaring tho people and killing tho
movement before It can be gotten un
der way. There is no question but
that the fees collected from the util
ities for authorities, etc., will be am
plo for its expenses.
Two months ngo pence and quiet
reigned in tho telephone field of Salt
Lake county, just aR in Iron county
Suddenly an incident occurred, a rate
adjustment, that set tho peoplo on
fire; ant Mr. PeetNtellsjus thnt at the
mass- meetini hold "In Murray and in
tended by representatives of the tele
phone company, "diplomacy and ar
gument were thrown to tho winds:"
note his words: "that the Mountain
States Telephone company prnved. if
it prayed at all, for a State Utilities
Commission, whero it would have but
threa men to deal with Instead of
twelve hundred, half of whom' worn
irate women." Then he goes on to
tell how tho telephone compnny wouid
have their "smart lawyer" take these
three out in nn automobile, show them
around, wine and dine them nt tho Ho
tel Utah, etc., etc., and tho people
would be fooled, tho company getting
just what they started out for. Now
Mr. Peet, could you not Ray with equal
consistency tho samo things about our
Supremo Court and other state and
county commissions? And nlso tho
Dr. Emcrv commission which is inves
tigating tho telephone compnny's rnto
schedule for the subscribers of Salt
Lnke county? Better wntch Dr. Em
ery or tho "smart lawyer" will get
him.
Note this from another pnrt of Mr
Poet's article: "Salt Lake countv
knows what it wants, nnd on the 2Gth
of this month (April) the commis
sioners of this countv established a
Public Utilities Commission to attend
to their own business in their own
county without asking Iron. San Juan
or any other of the outside counties
to please help them." This seems to
olease Mr. Peet. Ho has no fear that
the smnrt lawyer with his automo
bile wine, etc., can monkey with thp
public utilities commission of Salt
Lake county. How we admire a con
sistent fellow!
Many of our utilities are inter
county in their operation and could be
better handled by a state than by a
county commission. The expenses of
a stnto commission would not bo much
greater than those of Salt Lake coun
ty commission. And certainly ono
stnto commission would be moreof
ficlont nnd much cheaper thnn n num
ber of county commissions. And if Salt
Lake county needs regulation, tho oth
ers need it nlso.
Nobody will deny that tho recent
disturbance In Salt Lake county cost
the people a great deal of monov.
probably much more than ono year's
expenses of tho commission. Mr
Poet tells us that In some' stntcs the
commission cost over 5100.000. This
Is very true, but in those states thero
are thousands of utilities to be regu
lated, havincr invested hundreds of
millions of dollnrs.
When prohibition is to tho front the

reader gave a well-arranged program H
embodying a number of the old and 1
popular numbers, as well as some of M
moro recont conception and produc- iH
tlon. Her work was decidedly clever bHl
In many of the subjects, especially H
when her great handicap in the loss of fMV
her oyeslght is taken into consider- H
ntion. Tho tickets were for tho most IH
nnrt sold by tho students of tho dis- "HI
trict school, and a portion of tho re- lH
coipts was donated to tho local library. 'jjH
Mr. Will Pace, formerly of this city, ffiS
but who now residos at Price, Utah. j ' aSP
was in Cedar City the fore part of scwr
the week In tho interests of the Ford tSgji
car. Mr. Pace was accompanied by a ' juglS
man from tho Ford factory, and they 3S&V
were compiling a lot of data of var- u raSfe
lous kinda on local conditions. Just sS5s
whnt the objects were, we were un- tWJf
able to learn, but it was intimated by 'jffaBg
some of tho wise guys that It had to ifii&j
do with tho rumor that unless the big SR
-il refineries treat the public better in J WV1
tho matter of gasoline prices, Honry Ijk4$
Ford will enter the Rockerfellor realm t ' ?
and show tho trust how to soil caso- f A &
line at living prices. And it is safe ' f &.
to say that if Ford does butt in on tho m few
eal he will come pretty near carrying 1 jm?
it through, with his strong Belling and 1 im&A
manufacturing organization. lH!f
