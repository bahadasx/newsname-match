Committee Appointed to Assist in
Proper Observation of Founders'
Day—Delegates Will be Sent to
Ogden Good Roads Convention—
Four New Members, Including Mr.
M. B. Gwinn, Were Admitted to
Membership of Club.
Tuesday, May 23, was designated
"Factory Day" by the business men of
Caldwell at the regular monthly meet
ing of the Commercial club held Tues
day evening. On this day the business
men will visit the different manufact
uring plans of the city in a body, for
the purpose of obtaining first-hand in
formation regarding the various arti
cles manufactured in Caldwell. Dur
ing the discussion of the plan the
fact that this city has many plants
employing from one to 30 people was
strongly emphasized arid it was the
general opinion of the speakers that
the business men, in visiting the
various institutions would not only
profit by personal observation but
their interest would materially en
courage the manufacturer.
A committee of five Dr. F. M. Cole,
E. H. Plowhead, W. P. Lyon, W. G.
Cowden and T. S. Jackson, was ap
pointed bv President Zeh to arrange
details for the proper observance of
the day.
Dr. Cole is enthusiastic regarding
the plan and predicts that it will be
followed generally by cities of the
northwest.
"I believe that the Commercial club
has inaugurated a move of more than
local importance," declared Dr. Cole,
"a.nd its successful consummation
here will result in its being adopted
by other cities throughout the north
west. While we do not, at the pres
ent time have factories with hundreds
of men on their payroll, we do_ have
many smaller concerns and it is the
duty of every citizen to foster atjd
encourage their growth, for if we get
plants with an army of workers it
will be because of the success and de
velopment of ohr smaller institutions.
Our committee will meet Friday
evening to adopt definite plans for the
day and to make them successful it
will be necessary to secure the co
operation of the entire citizenship,
which as in the past will I am sure be
forthcoming." ,
The matter of employing a band for
weekly open air concerts was thor
oughly discussed by the membership.
Power was delegated the entertain
ment committee to arrange for week
ly concerts and to lav apd conduct the
open air dance pavillion owned by
the club. It is believed that the rev
enue derived from the dance will con
tribute largely towards the expense of
holding concerts. It is understood that
the committee has several proposals
under consideration and that definite
action will be taken at a meeting to
be held this week.
It was urged upon the club members
and the citizens in general to co-oper
ate with the college authorities in
making Founders' Day celebration to
be held Friday a success. Dr. J. W.
Guc and W. M. Ewing were appointed
by President Zell to secure the co
operation of the citizens.
The following applicants for mem
bership were elected unanimously. M.
B. Gwinn, Cecil L. Faris, Homer Rice
and George M. Larson.
President Zeh, was authorized to
appoint five delegates to the good
roads convention to be held in Ogden,
June 13 and 14.

REQUEST OF

Rankin Introduces and Board Passes
Resolutions Asking that Water Cost
be Fixed at not to Exceed $28.00
Per Acre—Farmers Protest Against
Sale of Telephone Lines—Sale of
Surplus Water in Deer Flat Reser
voir Authorized.
At a meeting of the board of di
rectors of the Boise Water^ Users
association held in this city Tuesday,
resolutions were introduced by Di
rector C. M. Rankin, and adopted by
the board praying that the Reclama
tion Service assure the settlers that
the cost of water on the project will
not exceed $28.00 per acre, the esti
mated cost of water. The resolutions
presented by Mr. Rankin and adopted
were as follows:
Whereas, It is now apparent that
the cost of water right on the Boise
project will soon be announced, and .
Whereas, Said cost is certain to be
greatly in excess of the announced
cost, estimated at time of beginning of
this project, viz: $25 to $28 per acre
and, ,
Whereas, Such costs were used,
with the knowledge and consent and
probably, directly, bv the Reclamation
officials, as an inducement to settlers
to file homestead entry on these lands,
thereby making possible the repay
ment to the government of the con
struction charges on said project, and
Whereas, Most of said settlers re
lied on the promise and good faith of
the government that such charges on
ly would be required to be paid, and
Whereas, Any charge in excess of
the said $25 to $28 per acre will be a
great hardship on the said settlers,
contrary to expectations, they had a
right to expect and confiscatory of the
lands of many, on which they have
expended all their money and energy
for the last six or more years, and
Whereas, The said settlers are still
relying on the government to act in
good faith and all fairness with them
as they have done heretofore, now
therefore, , ...
Be It Resolved; That the Water
Users' Association now request the
Secretary of the Interior and the
lamation Commission, or other offi
cials, having authority, to grant the
relief asked for in these resolutions
and that they assure us at an early
date that no charge in excess of til
said $25 to $28 will be required.
Copies of the resolutions were or
dered sent to Secretary Lane, the lr
rigation Commission and the Boise ot
fice of the Boise projeot.
Sixty Two Petition District.
Petitions signed by 62 settlers were
presented to the board by Messrs.
William McCluskey and Harry N.
Wood asking that the Water Users
association be converted into an irri
gation district. Mr. Wood took occas
misreorcscnted the attitude of the
settlers toward the irrigation district.
In substantiation of his statement he
presented his petition with 50 signa
tures. There are upwards of 2,000 set
tlers on the Boise project. Mr Mc
Cluskey, who has been employed by
Mr. B. E. Stutemyer. counsel for the
Reclamation Service, presented
petition with 10 signatures.

They were not convinced
A third

that the proposed change was desir
able or wise at this time. I he pro
posed district was left exactly where
it has been for several months.
Members of the board reported
that they were unable to secure sig
natures to the petition. Mr. Ed. . ""JL 1 ' 1 '
secretary of the New \ ork Canal C o.,
stated that he met with no encourage
ment from the settlers in his section.
The board of directors will consider
the matter of organizing an irrigation
district after the Reclamation Service
has announced the cost of water on
the Boise project. Until this an
eemeut is made the board will
nounc
take no action.
No Telephone Lease or Sale.
A resolution passed by the Ada
A
Pomona grange at Kuna objecting to
sale of the government telephone sys
tem was read into the records. Rec
lamation officials state that the gov
ernment has not contemplated sale o
its telephone lines. It is understood
that the Mountain States company has
approached the government with a
reouest for a lease of the equipment
Talks were made by several of the
directors against the proposal even
to lease the project phone system,
which is quite extensive and valued at
about $50,000. They stated frankly
that small rural mutual systeJns
among the farmers are in contempla
tion, and that they can operate quite
inexpensively where it is possible to
make use of the government s poles,
a concession gratuitously extended on
one or two projects it is claimed
Request of Secretary Smith that
water be sold to the New \ ork canal
during the present season under tem
idcntical with those
porary contracts identical wun inose
of last year was voted as acceptable
to the association. It remains, how
ever, for the government to agree to
this arrangement. The association
went on record as favoring the sale
of any surplus waters in the Arrow
rock and Deer Flat reservoirs to late
season buyers again this year on tin
same terms as were arranged in 1915.

BULL MOOSE
PROGRESSIVES ARE WILLING
TO HARMONIZE ON SOME
OTHER CANDIDATE
THAN COL. THEO
DORE ROOSFVELT
—MEAL TICKET.
Big Bull Mooser Satisfied That Two
Parties Will Get Together at Chi
cago—Progressives. Hold.... Olive
Branch—Good, Strong American
Citizen Who Will Uphold Flag is
all that is Needed—Man Who is
Satisfactory to Republicans will do.
The Progressive party will not in
sist upon the nomination of Theodore
Roosevelt for president if the Repub
licans will name a candidate at Chi
cago "who stands for Progressive
principles and is ab'e to put them
through," according to a statement
made at New York Wednesday night
by George W. Perkins, after a meet
ing of the executive committee of the
Progressive national committee.
"We, of course, are for Colonel
Roosevelt," Mr. Perkins assert
ed, "and shall suggest his name
to the Republicans. If they reply
that they will not agree on the
Colonel, we shall ask them to
name their man, who ought to be
as nearly unanimous a choice as
our man is. We arc willing to be
reasonable for the sake of har
mony."
Mr. Perkins' statement supplement
ed one issued by the executive com
mittee in which it was said:
"If the Republican convention is
responsive to the patriotic spirit that
brought the Republican party into be
ing and made it dominant for half a
-enturv it will meet this crisis in a
spirit of broad patriotism that rises
■ibove partisanship. Should the ef
fort fail, the responsibility for the re
sult will not rest on the Progressive
convention but will rest on other
shoulders than ours.
Must Have Leader.
"In this turning point in world
history, we will not stick on de
tails. We will lay aside partisan
ship and prejudices, but we will
never surrender the principles for
which we stand and have stood,
and will follow only a leader who
we know stands for them and is
able to put them through. We are
for peace, but not for 'peace at
any price.'"
It was said that the Republicans
and independent voters in general had
responded "understandingly to the
sentiments expressed" in the state
ment issued in January by the pro
gressive national committee, which in
effect was an appeal for Republicans
and Progressive to "get together."
It was added, however, that ' there
is an element in the Republican party
leadership which seems to be giving
more thought to what that party is
against and whom it is against, than
to what it is for and whom it is for.
Therefore, we again call attention to
our Chicago statement as to the in
evitable outcome of a failure to reach
a common understanding."
