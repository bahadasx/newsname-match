of this place, it will be remembered.
Immediately after their marriage
they left for Gastonia, N. C, from

TOO CLASSY PITCHING
Proves Undoing of Stanford Nine
Which Meats Second Defeat.
The Stanford High School team's
second defeat of the season came
Tuesday afternoon when the nine
from Eastern Normal of Richmond
walloped the waddin' out of Stan
ford High by the score of 13 to 5.
It was simply a case of too fast
pitching for the home lads. Lewis,
on the mound for the Normalites, is
some pitcher. The fact that he
twirled two season in the Virginia
League, a Class C organization, be
fore going back to his home in Lew
is county and taking the principal
ship of a school, is sufficient evidence
of justi what the high school boys
here were up against. Lewis had
almost "everything" that a pitcher
should have, and he had the local
batters eating out of his hand all
afternoon. With gilt-edged suppprt
he would easily have scored a shut
out. Against such pitching Stan
ford was helpless, and it was no
wonder that the fielding game the
locals showed was slightly off class.
The school boys did very well, how
ever, as the box score shows:

Officers who went to the East End
early in the week in an effort to ar
rest the Hopkins "boys" who "play
ed a little rough" at Crab Orchard
last Saturday, say that it is as tough
to catch them as it would be to catch
a rabbit in a blackberry patch. Dep
uty Sheriff W. S. Drye and Chief of
Police B. D. Carter, who took the
warrants against the five brothers
were unable to serve them. They
found Joe Hopkins, the father, at his
home in the Fall Lick country, back
of Crab Orchard, and he told the
officers that his sons had been in the
j neighborhood recently but had left.
Mr. Hopkins regretted very much
that the young men had gotten them
selves into trouble with the law, and
stated hat he had urged them to
give themselves up and yet believed
that he might be able to induce them
! to do so. The officers say that they
found evidence that the young men
had been working in the fields but
had disappeared as soon as they
came into the neighborhood.

BOND ELECTION TOMORROW
Very little interest seems to be
aroused in the $200,000 road bond
election which will be held Saturday
tomorrow. The election has been
the subject of considerable conver
sation lately, but no organized effort
either for the bunds or against. them
appears to have been made. Several
citizens and taxpayers have written
cards about the question, which are
printed as advertising in this issue of
the I. J. and will undoubtedly be
read by voters before they go to
the polls tomorrow. The same offi-
i cers of election who conducted the
last November election are required
to serve in this special election. Ii
is expected that the vote cast will
be rather light.

McKINNEY TEAM WINS AGAIN.
The McKinney baseball team de
feated the Moreland team, for the
second time this season, on the lat-tei-'s
ground last Sunday afternoon
by the score of 11 to 7. Ragged
fielding by the visitors gave More
land a five run lead but during the
rest of the game they seemed to be
almost helpless in run gettng. The
ninth round opened with Moreland
leading 7 to 5 but the base-hits be
gan to ring off the bats of the Mc
Kinney boys and the game was soon
put on ice. Baugh led off in the
ninth with a hit to right and Dayton
beat out an infield hit followed by a
hit by Murphy which filled the bases.
