A MATCH AND SOME GASOLINE
An irresponsible man, old enough
to be grandpa, a car, some spilled
gasoline, and a lighted match were
the principal faotors; a tragedy was
narrowly averted.
It was last Sunday, almost noon.
A Maxwell car, bearing Oklahoma
license No. 29424M, stopped at the
gasoline station In front of the Stone
garage to have her tank filled. In
some way, mysterious or otherwise,
gas was spilled upon a part of the up
holstery and the driver's trousers leg.
Mr. Chauffeur was tired ot dry
smoking his cigar and produced a
match. He stooped to light It hence
the ignition.
Business picked up, and the cat
was vacated. , Mr. C. demanded im
mediate attention, and received it.
The flames were smothered from
him before the fire extinguisher was
led to the timely assistance of the
car. Then there followed weeping,
and wailing, and gnashing of teeth;
it had been found that fire and gaso
line were not the best of friends.
The injuries sustained by the man
were very painful, but will not prove
fatal. Outside of a burned cushion
or two, the car is no worse for the
experience.

IRWIN BUYS ROMER HOME
A deal was macfe last week where
by the home of Mr, and Mrs. R.
Romer, on Kansas avenue, passed
into the possession of Postmaster E.
S. Irwin. This property is one of
the good homes on that street and
will make Mr. and Mrs. Irwin a fine
residence. Mr. Romer got a quarter
section from Mr. Irwin in the deal.
He will give possession about July 1.
The Romers are going to Hutchinson
about that time to make their home,
which will be more centrally located
for Mr. Romer to look after his grain
and other lines of business than Liberal.
OLD SOLDIERS' MONUMENT 13

Memorial day and fitting exercises
are planned for that day. The mon
ument was paid for by subscription
among the business men and old
soldiers living In and around Liberal.
It Is the figure of a soldier at "parade
rest," and Is a good symbol to place
at the last camping ground of the
old boys who have passed into the
Fort "where Glory guards, In silent
round, the bivouac of the dead."

"THE SCANDAL" WAS GOOD
"The Scandal," the play put on at
the opera house by the Lenn Harris
Stock company, was pronounced' an
excellent production; by, everyone
who saw it. Harris Is getting a fine
troupe of talent gathered together
and the company should finish up a
successful season. Ray Kennedy,
whom we claim as a Liberal product.
Is the comedian of the cast and is
making good. His specialties are
worthy of special mention and that
he will make good on the stage is a
foregone conclusion. They will make I
Liberal every Saturday night during
the summer, and will present
'Hearts Adrift tomorrow night, an
ad., of which you will find in this
issue of the Democrat.
THOUGHT. HE WAS IN LOS ?
... ANGELES , " '
FerreU Antonio, an Italian passen
ger on No. I Sunday en route for
Loa Angeles, got his wires crossed
when he reached Liberal and stopped
off, under the Impression he ' had
reached his destination. Mr. An
tonio had just landed in New York
from Italy a few days ago and bought
a ticket clear to Los Angeles from
that city. Not being able to speak
English and hearing soma passengers
speak the name of the latter city he
decided It must be time to land, with
the result that he stepped off the
train and never realized his mistake
until after the train bad pulled out
Some Greek laborers at the depot
knew enough Italian to figure out his
nationality and they at once directed
him to Corporal Donato, who hasn't
been over the pond so XoQ MMHi
and the eorporal took oare ot him. ,
until the next day, when he was put
aboard No. 1 and sent on his way re
joicing. Mr. Antonio had inherited
some money and property In Call-.,
fornia and was going over to sea
about It. He Is a married man and
conducts a fruit and wine business In
his native land. ' .
A BIG LAND DEAL 1
The half section of land four miles
southeast of Liberal belonging to
Harry Matkln, was sold this week.
The consideration was $16,100.00,
and the purchaser was Alexander
McGregor of Stafford, Kansas. This
land is located Just over the line In
Beaver county, Oklahoma. It was
school land at one time and was pur
chased by Mr. Matkin on December
1, 1914. This land has brought
about the highest price of any deal
that has come to our notice lately.
However, it was a very desirable lo
cation and well improved. The deal
was made through the H. N. Witt
& Co. agency. ,
NEW FEED STORE
Jim Johnston, formerly proprietor
ot the Pullman Cafe, has decided he
would rather sling baled hay and
feed sacks than hash, and has opened
feed store on Second street, oppo
site the Stone garage. As yet he
is only handling hay and feed but
will add flour and other lines later.
Jim is a good fellow and the Demo
crat hopes the business pans out ac
cording to his wishes.
