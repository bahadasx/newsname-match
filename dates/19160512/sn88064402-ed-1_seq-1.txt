4 five had been voted for Bourgeois; e
ýs eleven for Fontenot; and the other
6 twelve votes had marked on them ei
st ther for both candidates for sheriff
or no vote for sheriff. Seven other
i. votes for Fontenot, that had been a
counted by the commissioners, will be
contested by Mr. Bourgeois, it was in
Sdicated at the count. e
It would appear from the count that
even though the court should count 2
Ie in all of the spoiled ballots that had
(1 I been voted for Bourgeois, and spoiled 2
. on some other part of the ticket ac
w cording to the count of the commis
sioners at that hox, Mr. Fontenot

The Elton ball(t b)x, containing
the votes cast at that precinct on
1. April 18, 1916, was opined by order
of court Monday and the votes re
counted.
At this box fifty-eight votes had
been counted by the commissioners
as spoiled. Alfred J. Bourgeois, re
cent candidate for sheriff on the pro- 2
gressive ticket, filed a petition in 2
court last Wednesday, asking for a .w
recount of the votes cast at Elton,
stating in his petition that he intends 2
contesting the election of Isaac Fon
tenot, the candidate of the Democrat
ic ticket, and the condidate elected
sheriff, according to the official count, 2?
by a majority of fifty-three votes.
The box was opened by Clerk of
Court Isaac R. Price Monday morn
in,. Sheriff Joseph Fuselier and As- 2
sessor Luke L. Richard were the offi
cial witnesses appointed by the court. 2
Out of the fifty-eight ballots mark
box will be contested on other 24
grounds. 24
The count was preliminary to the 24
contest proper. The suit for a con
test must be filed within thirty days
following the election, which would 24
give the contestant until next Wed- i
nesday to file the suit. 24
Much intee.-t was taken in the 24
count of the box by many Eltonites
.1. S. Treme, who was elected mem- 21
iher of the police jury from the Fourth
Ward, by a majority of sixty-seven 24
votes over Thos. S. Plunkett, was es- 24
pecially interested in the count. The
co·n1t showed him to have a majority
even though the spoiled ballots are
'counted in.-Times-Record.
