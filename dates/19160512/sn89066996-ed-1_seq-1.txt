A Narrow Escape
While driving Rev. O. H. L. Cun
ningham, pastor of the Baptist
Church, out to Hospital No. 4. last
Sunday afternoon, the buggy in which
the pastor and driver, Richard Hol
land, were seated was struck by an
atrto as it was crossing the street at
the jail corner going south. The au
to was running quite rapidly in an
easterly direction striking the buggy
with such force as to tear off the rear
wheels, and the force of the impact
was such as to throw the occupants of
the buggy away from the machine,
thereby saving them from more se
rious injury. The collision frightened
the horse, which is the property of
Hospital No. 4, causing it to run a
block or two before it was stopped.
An inventory of the damages done
developed the fact that neither Rev.
Cunningham nor Richard Holland
were seriously hurt, though the
preacher sustained several minor
bruises and scratches, also sprained
shoulder. Judging from the tracks of
the auto where the collision occurred,
the driver of the machine was entire
ly to blame, being well to the right of
the road, in the direction the buggy
was traveling, and no other vehicle
being near at the time. While the
auto stopped for some time it seems
that no one was present to inquire
into the identity of its owner, and it
finally went on its way without mak-

to the scheme; they believed the Doe
Run property the more valuable and
would not consent to turn in their
stock and receive therefor St. Joseph
stock at the proportion offered by
the latter company. The St. Joseph
holds or controls a considerable share
of the Doe Run stock, and the man
agement evidently believes the time
is now ripe for a consolidation, but
we understand that quite an influen
tial coterie of Doe Run stockholders
will oppose the movement.
Suit for the appointment of a re
ceiver for the Doe Run Lead Com
pany of Bonne Terre, Mo.,( together
with a petition for an injunction
against the sale of the company to
the St. Joseph Lead Company, a New
York corporation, was filed in the
United States District Court Wednes
day by Samuel R. Maynard of Geor
gia, who holds 1,100 shares of stock
in the Doe Run Company.
Maynard asks that the election of
directors May 6, be set aside, and
that the stock of the Doe Run Com
pany, which is held by the St. Joseph
Company, be not admitted to vote at
a stockholders meeting of the former
company.
The occasion for the suit is the pro
posed meeting of the stockholders
set for next Tuesday, at which the
proposal to sell the company will be
voted on.
Judge Dyer set Monday as the date
for a hearing.

asked for by them. Steps will doubt
less be taken to discover the owner
of the car. There is entirely too much
reckless driving, and automobile road
hogs are entirely too numerous for
the safety of the general public. A
few examples should be made of reck
less driving in order to compel great

as the laws against speeding on pub

THREE TRAINS A DAY TO
ST. LOUIS VIA M. R. & B. T. R. R.
The M. R. & B. T. Railway last
Sunday started an extra train over its
line to St. Louis, making three trains
each day to and from the city. Con
nections from Farmington' over the
Electric railroad via Flat River are
as follows: Leave Farmington at
4:24 and 8:14 a. m., and 2:10 p. m.,
arriving in St. Louis at 8:35 and 11:50
a. m. and 6:10 p. m. Leave St. Louis
for Farmington at 7:50 a. m. and
3:15 and 5:31 p. m., arriving in Farm
ington at 11:47 a. m. and 6:42 and
9:23 p. m.
An extra car has been placed on the
Electric railroad to Flat River, and
slight changes made in the time
schedule. By reference to the
"Travelers' Guide", which appears in
each issue of The Times, you may

between Farmington and Flat River

up to date.

ANOTHER MOVE IN
RIGHT DIRECTION
New Schedule on M. R. & B. T. Railway
Effective Last Sunday, Great Im
provement in Public Service
The new schedule of train service
on the M. R. & B. T. Railway, which
went into effect last Sunday, as well
as the schedule of the electric rail
road, from Farmington to Flat River,
which pives pood connection at that
point, is another step in the direction
the Times has been pointing for some
time. That the M. R. & B. T. Rail
way will be the principal beneficiary
in such efforts to render to its patrons
the best possible service there is no
reason to doubt, as the traveling pub
lic is always quick to see and appre
ciate any effort that may be put forth
for its benefit.
The Times also wishes to congrat
ulate the management of these pub
lic service corporations for this long
step toward making them truly ser
vants of the people, and if The Times'
position in this matter has served to
remind them, in a way, as to their
duty to the public, then we are addi
tionally pleased. It has also been no
ticeable, since the new schedule be
came operative, by which an addition
al car has been put on to Flat River,
that practically all the cars are still
enwded. even before the new sched
ule has become familiar to the public.
Now if the service of the electric
road can be improved somewhat at
the DoLassus end, then there can be
no reasonable objection to the car ser
A Good Old Citizen
Mr. Frank E. Clay culled lost Sat
urday and renewed his subscription
to The Times, of which he has been
a reader many years. Mr. Clay lives
at Frankclay (the postoffice was
named for mm) in Randolph town-
ship. He is one of the county's old

zens. He it a native of the county
Bad was 82 years old on the 14th of
last January. We was born January
14, 1X36, on the St. Francois River,
near ReLassus, on the farm which is
lpw known as the John B. Higrdey
farm, and which was then owned by
his father. His father, James W.J
FRANK E. CLAY.
Clay, was born in St. Charles county,
Mo., in 1806, coming to this vicinity
as a lad in 1811, and may therefore
be reckoned among the early pioneers
of St. Francois county.
Mfj F. E. Clay was reared on the
farm and in his early manhood taught
school for several years, but after
wards and for the greater part of bis
life devoted himself to farming, at
which he was very successful. He
has been married three times, and
survives all his wives. His first mar
riage was to Miss Mary Jane Breck
enridge of Washington county in
1849. To this union ten children were
born, only three of whom ate living
two sons, Marvin and George Clay,
both of whom live in the vicinity of
Frankclay, and one daughter, Juetta,
now Mis. William Moore, of Wash
ington county. His wife died in 1879,
and in 1881 he married Miss Lucy
Brooks of Potosi, with whom he lived
about twenty years. After her death
he married Miss Elizabeth Jane Cul
bertson of Edwardsport, Indiana, who
died April 4th of the present year.
No children were born to either of the
latter two wives.
Mr. ( lay, though past His 82d year,
is strong and vigorous in mind and
body, and has always enjoyed the re
spect and good will of all who know
him. He is a member of the South
ern Methodist Church, a man of ex
cellent Christian character, intelli
gence and straightforward purpose,
a life-long Democrat, and keeps him
self informed and well in touch with
current events and the public ques
tions of the day.
Bad Accident
George P. Ware fell from a scaf
fold while at work remodeling the old
Taaffe building, north of the square,
yesterday morning, sustaining quite
serious injury. He was at once taken
to Dr. Watkins hospital, where he is
being attended.
vice insofar as the Farmington situ
ation is concerned. While practically
every other paper in the county ex
cept The Times published last week
the new schedule, we are constantly
on guard to prevent becoming "fluster
ed" over little things, and this week
in our "Travelers' Guide" column will
be found the new schedule, complete
and up-to-date, the publication of
which does not cost the railway com
pany one penny. Contrary to the
opinion of some, The Times holds ab
solutely no prejudice against the rail
road nor mining companies of this
county but we do believe they should
bear their just proportion of taxes,
as well ns serve the public convenience
in the best possible way, when they
are engaged in public service.
We arc also convinced that the men
who are in control of such corpora
tions are too big mentally to become
"peeved" when one fights on the
square and in the open for the prin
ciples of "equal and exact rights for
all and special privileges to none."
In fact, men of sufficient capacity to
successfully control such combina
tions of capital are, of necessity, of
sufficient breadth of mind to admire
an open and fair struggle for abso
lute equality. This is The Times'
position, and will so continue to be
under its present management.

FEVERISH MINING
UNREST ALLAYED
Striking Shovelers in Lead Belt Return
to Work Wednesday With "Griev
ances" Apparently Satisfied
A state of feverish unrest through
out the Lead Belt, which resulted in
many of the shovelers walking out
from the mines the first of the week,
without notice, has been the cause of
considerable speculation, if not un
easiness, even in this vicinity, which
is more or less affected by conditions
in that ordinarily prosperous region,
which unquestionably is the livest and
most prosperous section of the entire
State.
In order to get first-hand informa
tion regarding the real conditions
in that section a Times reporter
made a trip through the Lead Belt in
search of all possible information.
Among others interviewed in regard
to the strike situation were H. G.
Washburn, superintendent of the Fed
eral, and P. A. Haines, superintend
ent of the Doe Run, both in the Flat
River field. Both of these gentlemen
reported that the miners are all now
back to work, and expressed the hope
that the trouble wus at an end.
Like others, however, they did not
appear to be in possession of accu
rate knowledge of just what the trou
ble was. They stated that the walk
out was wholly by the shovelers, prac
tically all of whom are foreigners,
though such walk-out of necessity
forced many other miners out of work
while the shovelers were out. The
mine representatives did not say that
any further inducement had been of
Body of Revolutionary
Hero is Disinterred
On September 6, 1836, Captain James
Caldwell, a patriot and soldier of
the Revolutionary war, died at Farm
ington, and was buried on his home
place, afterward the Judge William
Carter place. After Judge Carter's
death, the Carter property was laid
off into town lots utreets and alleys.
It so happenen that Captain Caldwell's
grave wns left in an alley running
east and west back of the old Car
ter house.
Last Monday Dr. J. P. Sebastian
of Williamsville, Wayne county, came
to Farmington, to superintend the
disinterment of the body of Captain
Caldwell and have such of the remains
as might be found after eighty years
reinterred in some cemetery. The
Doctor in this was animated by a sen
timent interwoven with the Caldwell
and Sebastian families, and was as
sisted in this work to preserve the
memory and mark the resting place
of the old soldier and a pioneer of St.
Francois county by the Sarah Barton
Murphy Chapter of the Daughters of
the American Revolution.
The disinterment took place Tues
day morning. All that was found of
the body were the skull, the thigh and
shin bones. These were carefully
stored in a box and placed in charge
of Milton Spaugh, and will at a date
not yet decided upon be given a final
resting place in Parkview Cemetery
Bootlegging Period in Court
The Circuit Court convened last
Monday, Judge Peter Huck on the
bench. The week has been taken up
mostly with cases of illegal selling of
intoxicants, and the Judge doesn't
seem disposed to show much leniency.
He says it is not a question of wet and
dry, but a question of law, whether
the law shall be enforced and offend-,
ers punished.
In the case of John Wilkson of Bonne
Terre for violating the local option
law on dive,rs occasions, he elected
to be tried by jury, and wa3 found
guilty on one count, the jury assess
ing his tine at $1,000 with an addi
tional punishment of twelve months'
confinement in jail. He took an ap
peal from the judgment. There are
other counts against him which have
not been disposed of.
Wm. Asbridge, under similar
charge, entered a plea of guilty, and
the court taxed him with a line of
$300. On the recommendation of the
Prosecuting Attorney he was paroll
ed. Other counts against Asbridge
were dismissed.
Grover Sherman, another violator
Farmington
Boy Honored
Carl Trauernicht, one of Farming

County Clerk, on Tuesday received
telegraphic notice of his election as

Division. This college is located in
Lebanon, Tenn.

fered the strikers to return to work,
but that their wage schedule would
compare favorably with similar work
in any other field.
There have recently been added
three 10 per cent bonuses to the wag
es of all mine workers, which brings
the wages now being paid shovelers
up to $3.55 for eight hours' work, and
there is a feeling in that district that
it is these frequent voluntary increas
es in wages that has put the "fly in
the ointment" for the foreigners, who
cannot understand the "why" of such
proceedings. According to such idea,
these frequent increases in wages,
without their asking it, should enable
them, in case of a strike, to clean up
"all that is in sight."
But there is one thing apparently
made clear by the recent action of the
shovelers. 'lhey do not like "bonus
es." In fact that was one of their de
mands perhaps the only one that
stands out clearly. They wanted
straight time without the bonus. As
to whether or not thoy have received
any assurance along that line, The
Times was unable to learn. However,
the fact that the more intelligent
American miners throughout the field
have failed to join in the strike, being
entirely satisfied with their wages,
seems to indicate that the shovelers
had little, or nothing, to stand on in
their strike. It seems to have been
a case of too much prosperity for
them.
with appropriate ceremonies under the
auspices of the 1). A. R. local Chapter.
Captain James Caldwell wa a na
tive of Virginia, and after the Revo
lutionary War, in which he served
with distinction, he removed to Crab
Orchard, Ky., and thence in 1310 to
Missouri locating in the Coo. Sett'e
ment. In that stftiiement in 1813 a
baby boy was born, and an hour af
terwards the spirit of the mother
passed into the silences. Capl. Cald
well and his wife took the motherless
babe to their hearts and reared him to
manhood. The babe was Edwin C.
Sebastian, who became a prominent
and successful citizen of the county,
and a leader in the Christian Church
at Libertyville. He reared a large
family, only three of whom are now
living Dr. J. P. Sebastian of Wil
liamsville, Mo., Hon. W. P. Sebastian
of Austin, Texas, and the vounger
daughter, Ella (Mrs. J. W. Williams
of Springfield, Mo.)
Captain Caldwell was Speaker of
the first General Assembly of Mis
souri, which convened at St. Charles
in 1820. In 1831 or 1832 he remov

to the charge and was likewise enter
ed up for a $300 fine. The Prosecut
ing Attorney in this case also recom
mended parole.
John Craft and Brad Jennings, ev
idently thinking that the judge was
too much inclined to sustain the law
in "bootlegging" cases, decided they
would rather take their chances be
fore somebody else, so applied for a
change of venue.
There are quite a number of other
cases of violations of the local option
law that have not yet been reached.
Other criminal cases disposed of are
the following:
Dewey Morris, grand larceny, of
which he pleaded guilty, and the court
gave him two years in the penitenti
ary; also F'rank Maloney for a like
infraction of the law got two years
of penal servitude.
Henry Alexander pleaded guilty to
flourishing a deadly weapon, und the
court advised him that the offense
would cost him $100 and trimmings;
and Uriah Robbins on a plea of guil
ty of carrying a concealed weapon
was impartially given a fine of $100.
