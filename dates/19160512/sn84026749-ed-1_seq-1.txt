LAREDO, Tex, May 12.-
The Government embargo os
ammunition, which went into
effect as a temporary raeasHre
a month ago, has been made
. permanent, according te adTlces
today. Government agents along
the border are understood to
have received instructions for
an impartial embargo on all
munitions.
Refusal by the Carranra govern
ment to epter into a formal agree
ment with the United States look
ing to co-operfction against border
outlaws has not altered the de
termination of President Wilson
and his advisers to keep the Amer
ican troops in northern Mexico.
This was demonstrated following
a Cabinet meeting today, when it
was declared that despite the com
plete failure of the Scott-Obre-
gon conferences, there is,toube'mT'J'
change of policy by this Govern
ment. In similar manner it was indi
cated that unless there is an overt
attempt on the part of the Mexi
can military forces to back up thu
demands of Carranra by an attack
ion the American troops, President
Wilson will not alter his purpose
not to intervene in Mexico.

Administration officials who hava fol
lowed closely the developments In con
nection with the Scott-Obregon confer

what will happen.
They believe. In the first place, that

his own people, inai ne u tuiiwiuusu
that from tho atandpplnt of Ws own
welfare it Is imperative that he should
not be" put In the poslUonot acquiescing
In the presence of American soldiers in
Mexico.
At the same time they believe Car
ranza fully realizes It would be , futile
for the Ill-equipped and poorly "
Mexican soldiers to ntterript an "
In force on the troops of General Fun
ston. who have already glyon the "ex
leans In northern Mexico a taste or
their efficiency. i...
Therefore. It Is the belief of these
officials that Carranza, will continue
making protests and demands as a mat
ter of course, the American forces the
meanwhile going about their biulnauof
cleaning up the bandits and safeguard
ing the American border.
ft la declared that only If Carrant
