Have Blocked Negotiations.
________ t \
El Paso, Toxus, May 11.?After almost
two weeks of discussion the conferences
of Gen. Hugh L. Scott, Gen.
Frederick Funston and Gen. Alvaro
Obregon, Mexican minister of war,
over American troop dispositions in
Mexico, came to an end to-night without
any pgreement being reached,
jjftie whole matter was referred back
s i*6 the American and defacto governments
to be settled through diplomatic
channels.
To-night the situation is almost exactly
where it stood before the conferences
began. The Mexican government
still insists on the withdrawal
of Gen. Pershing's columns upon a
certain date and wants that date to
come quickly. It is known that G<*n.
Obregon has been willing to make
concessions in order to reach an
agreement with the American con
ferees. Ho has boon overruled. however,
by the first ohiof. Vonustlano
Carranza, and his advisers. After
practically conceding the demands of
the American con ferees he was compelled
to remove his attitude.
After Two Conferences
The end of the negotiations came
after two conferences had been held.
The first began at 10 and lasted until
1 p. m., when a recess was taken unJ
til 4 p. ra. to permit Gen. Obregon
to keep a lunch engagement. Sharp
npon the hour the conference was renewed.
After two hours an a half,
however, came the end. Gen. Obregon,
accompanied by Juan Amador,
Mexican secretary of foreign affairs,
emerged from the private car
occupied by Gen. Scott and Gen. Funaton,
walked rapidly down the railway
yards, climbed into his waiting
ontnmnhiln and drnvp A WAV.
Gen. Obregon was accompanied :o
his machine by Oen. Funston. The
Mexican confree's manner was abrupt
and vexed, but Gen. Funston
smiled cheerily as he bade him goodbye.
Oen. Funston reentered the car.
Then Col. Robert ,E. Lee Michie, aide
to Oen. Scott, came out and distributed
copies of the following statement
to the waiting newspaper men:

CONFLICTING NEWS
OF TURKS' EFFORTS
Russians Toll of Continued Successes
Against Moslems While
Constantinople Reports Considerable
Defeat for Slavs in
the Caucasus.
The infantry actions in the region
of Verdun have again given way to
.ii init-ry oiiranannnonts, the most violent
of which was directed against
the French positions in the Caillette
wood and their second lines on the
right bank of the Mouse. Bombardment?
also have taken place along
the front held by (he Belgians, and
mining operations and artillery duels
have predominated on the British
front. A severe artillery duel is in
progress around the Ilohenzollern redoubt
between the British and Germans.
During the night there was another
shift in the line of attack upor
Verdun, according to the afternoon
French war otlice announcement.
Holding in check their forces on
tiie west bank of the Mouse, where
they recently have scored important
successes, the Germans a era in took
the offensive on the easterly side of
the stream, launching an attack near
Vnux. northeast of the fortress Thp
attack was unsuccessful, Paris declares.
Probable speedy resumption of infantry
drives northwest of the fortress,
however, is indicated by the
report of heavy firing by the artillery
in the region of the Avoeourt wood
southwest of Hill 304.
The French themselves are making
vigorous attacks on the German lin?s
in the Verdun region, according to
Berlin, which announces an assault
near Dead Man's hill and another
southeast of Hill 304. Both attacks
were broken up by German fire, it is
declared.
The Eastern front situation l?
growing more interesting. All along
the line the Russians were the object*
of occasional sharp thrusts by the
Teutonic allies. They seem to be
contending themselves with standing
off these attacks and are attempting
no offensive. In at least one instance
they failed to hold their line, however,
according to Berlin, which reports
tho cant ii ro COO ' -
? ?? ?vv ,101 via *JJ it
Russian position near Selburg.
Increased activity is reported from
the Ralkans. There has been much
firing by heavy artillery and some infantry
clashes have occured on the
Macedonian frontier. Athens dispatches
to-day report brisk fighting
north of Avlona. apparently indicating
that the Austrians are about t?
move against the Italians and such
other forces as may be assisting them
in holding the Adriatic seaport of
Avlona, Albania.
Much importance is attached it
Petrograd to the Russian operations
