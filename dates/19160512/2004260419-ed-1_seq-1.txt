CREAMERY OUTPUT
600 POUNDS DAILY
Successful Enterprise; $2,0)0.4K
Monthly Payroll
With the advent of pasture the
amount of cream delivered to the
creumerV Is Increasing every day.
And what is equally satisfactory to
the association is the steady increase
of shareholders. During the past
month the output of the creamery has
averaged 600 pounds dally. While
a regular market has not been fully
established for the entire output, the
Union Meat Co., of Portland, pur
chases the surplus over and above the
regular trade.
During April the amount paid for
cream lacked a few dollars of being
$2,000. Payment Is made on the.
16th of each month. The enterprise
has yielded a profit since the first
month of its establishment, which
is certainly very gratifying to the
association of farmers. By the co
operative plan, each patron receives
the full value of his cream without
paying commission or freight. The
delivery of cream at present amounts
to 30,000 pounds per month, and as
pasture Increases It is expected that
the supply will Increase accordingly.
