commenting on the announcement by
the Textile Manufacturers' associa
tion that it will test the new law re
lating to docking employes in cotton
mills.
"Millions of dollars have been
solen from the cotton mill operatives
through graft and robbery of dock
ing." continues the Home Circle,
which again gives this advice to
workers:
"If we had a well regulated labor
union that alone would be the best
law we could hay would better
regulate matters."

REPORT CONVICT LABOR BILL
Washington.—The senate commit
tee on education and labor has made
a favorable report on the Hughes con
vict labor bill, which has been amend
ed, however, to not apply to old con
victs, and not to take effect until
three years after adoption by con
gress. These amendments will indi
rate the opopsition of convict labor
contractors to this legislation, which
is urged by the American Federation
of Labor.
A bill similar to the Hughes bill has
been introduced in the house by
Congressman Booher and is now on
the house calendar. At present when
a state passes legislation regulating
the admission of convict labor prod
hcts from other states, it is con
strued as "an interference with inter
state commerce." The Booher-Hughes
legislation is really an enabling act
which will remove the interstate com
merce barrier where and state desires
to check the importantion of convict
made goods.
APPALLING LOSS OF LIFE
Washington.—Last Monday Senator
Owen presented a memorial to the
senate from the southern sociological
congress asking for the establishment
of a national department of health. It
is stated that:
"Six hundred thousand citizens of
the United States die annually of pre
ventable disease and 6,000,000 are
needlessly sick. The economic loss
per year from the last item alone is
a half billion dollars."
Scranton, Pa. — The Plasterers'
union has signed a contract with em
ployers which carries substantial bet
terments.
The Iron Molders' union has raised
wages, secured the nine-hour day and
a union shop agreement without much
effort as a result of thorough organ
ization.

PATRIOTISM AND PRIVILEGE
(From George P. West, Committee on
Industrial Relations, Washing- j
ton, D. C.) I
Washington.—Why the workers and
producers of America—all who are
fighting to make it a real democracy!
—should oppose war and resist appeal
to the "patriotism" that means privi
lege, is told in clear and convincing
fashion in the sensational new book
by Frederic C. Howe —"Why War?"
Here, in chapter after chapter, is
the whole story, told for the first time
in America, of how Big Business
manipulates the patriotic impulses of
the people and uses government to
back its schemes of exploitation with
the treasure and blood of the nation.
"Everybody's Magazine" has at
tacked the Committee on Industrial
Relations for warning the public
against the conspiracy of the Rocke
feller-Morgan group to use the na
tion's "surplus wealth," now heaped
up in New York banks, for a cam
paign of financial imperialism in weak
foreign countries where labor is cheap
and rich natural resources may be
plundered almost at will.
The Committee had pointed out that !
the men who organized the American
International Corporation are the
same men who have been preaching
cheap labor costs at home, attacking
Presiden Wilson for his refusal to
conquer Mex/ico in their interest, and
urging with all their might a great
army and navy and an aggressive
foreign policy.
In Dr. Howe's new book the editors
of "Everybody's" and all the other
shouters in behalf of financial im
perialism will find page after page of
evidence showing the danger that
threatens democracy in America from j
the conspiracy now masquerading as
a program to increase foreign trade.
By relating some of the recent his
tory of Europe, Dr. Howe shows that
the use of governmental authority to!
promote private schemes of spolia
tion, as Well Street would like to
have it used in Mexico, is the prime
cause of a large percentage of the
international troubles of the world.
DOLLAR "PATRIOTS"
The Vanderlip pretense that it is l
necessary to acquire huge conces-,
sions in weak and undeveloped eoun
triei, in order to build up foreign
trade, is exposed.
"The real trade of the world," Dr.
Howe points out, "is among the civ- ,
'.lized peoples: it is between the great
powers. The real markets for foreign
trade are with the great powers .
rather than with the colonies and de- .
pendent peoples."
Dr. Howe quotes from the Ameri
can International Corporation's an
nouncement that its purpose is to ,
enable the United States to take a
larger part than heretofore in the in-
dustnial development of other coun
tries where capital is needed.
"Such countries are certainly not (
Great Britain, France and Germany—
the great investing nations of Eu
rope," adds the author. "The coun
tries where 'capital is needed' are the
weak and helpless peoples of Mexico,
Central America, and South America, 1 1
of Morocco, Tunis, Persia, Africa,
China and the insular possessions of i
the United States.
"Wealth is accumulating," so the
announcement reads, "so rapidly that
a portion of it can be spared for in
vestment abroad." I
And Dr. Howe shows how this "sur- j
phis wealth" has lured Great Britain |
into Egypt and the Transvaal, France
into Morocco, Germany into Turkey, .
aided in strangling Persia, drained
France of capital needed for internal
development, negotiated the "six
power" loan to China. And how Pre*- <
ident Wilson saved us from "dollar
diplomacy" by refusing to sanction .
our taking part in the scheme to con- ,
trol the internal administration and ,
revenue system of China. j
"Dollar diplomacy, navalism and ]
the exploitation of weaker peoples," |
he adds, "have gone hand fn hand |
during the last twenty years. The |

statement that this Is a movement for
I the promotion of foreign trade, as the
| organizers of these corporations de
clare and as patriotic business men
have been led to believe. As has
j been seen, none of the countries of
Europe have materially advanced
! their trade and commerce by the or

J that alleged purpose. Rather the
foreign banking agencies are engaged
in obtaining concessions, building
railroads, securing mining, land and
oil grants, n the making of loans to
weaker powers, and in co-operating in
the sale of munitions.
"And an examination of the in
terests of th ebanking institutions
! that are promoting the new corpora
tion shows that their relations are
not in the field of manufacturing,
j trade and commerce at all. They are
iin the field of monopoly, finance and

the American people.
"No element is lacking in this new
imperialism of finance which, under
the glamour of patriotism, aims to
exalt America to the dignity of Great
Britain, Germany, Russia and France
as a world 'power.' Line by line the
history of the exploitation of defense
less people is foreshadowed in the
program that privilege would have us
enter upon. High finance, the making
of munitions at colossal profits, over
seas exploitation, dollar diplomacy,
and a great navy ready and willing to
demand the open or the closed door,
as the immediate advantage may dic
tate, these are the elements of
financial imperialism that have
brought Europe to its present end.
"Only the chance election of a
President might deetrmine the uses
to which ♦his preparedness would be
put, with the power of high finance,
the control of the press, and the in
visible powers of privilege ready at a
moment's notice to urge the unleash

and 'national honor.'

"Yet these same classes are un

things they own no heavier than Eng
land and Germany were carrying in
times of peace. They suggest that the
cost should be borne by a higher
tariff and by indirect taxes on the
things the people consume.
"Democracy has a right to insist
that preparedness is not merely a de
mand for private profit: that an in
creased navy is not designed as an
agency for the promotion of over-seas

We certainly want national se

preparedness you mean something
more than armor plate. No country is
prepared, no matter how large its
supplies of munition or how large its
army may be, if its people have noth

LAWLESS "COSSACKS"
CLUB MEN AND WOMEN
Scranton. Pa. —The state constabu
lary, known as "cossacks," is blamed
for rioting at Wilkes-Barre.
Street car men have been on strike
for several months, and that town is
the scene of numerous outbreaks by
Waddell strikebreakers, guards and
the state constabulary. Th* Wilkes-
Barre correspondent to the Scran
tonian says:
"One would really be led to believe,
if he was to pay attention to the
preachers of law and order, that to
refuse to ride on scab-manned cars,
or refuse to be beaten up by a Wad
dell thug, was a crime and that the
authorities should take some action
against all such offenders. But as
bad as the Waddell crew of hired
thugs are. the county today is in
fested by a more daring band, and the
very lives and liberties of the citizens
ar emenaced by a horde of irrespon
sible chaps who wear the badge of
the state and go about armed to the
teeth looking for and provoking
trouble.
"That the city and county is
menaced by a lawless horde, there is
no denying. That state, county anil
city authorities seem to be linked
with the traction company in the ef
fort to drive the strikers back to
work and compel the people to ride
the scab-manned cars, there is very
little reason to doubt.
"But the lawlessness and disorder
that breaks out In spots hereabouts

city authorities but did their duty.
