It was stated that tho last resting
place of those of tho community
called to the long home, should be
better cared for than ran be done
under the present arrangements and
that the city properly should be the
owner of tho 'silent city of the dead";
that acting In conjunction with the
cemetery association, which the ladies j
of iho city organized, little difficulty

keeping the city cemetery tt neat and

At this time Clerk Reynolds an
nounced that he had several petitions
and a couple of applications to report
relative to the vacancy on the police
department.
Rumors having been floating abroad
for the past several days that a "hot
time in the old town" might be put
on tho graphaphone when this was
reached, everyone present "sat up and
took notice," while the chief of police
took a fresh hold on his chewing to-
One petition called for the reinstate
ment of Berry Williamson as a mem
ber of tho force, one for the appoint
ment of Stringfield, formerly a dep
uty sheriff, one for the appointment
of Bill Elston, whiie the applications
were from Weatherford and B. E. Day.
After Clerk Reynolds had finished
reading the petitions and tho applica
tions and while the air seemed sur
charged with ingrown excitement,
Councllma,n Hayes, suave diplomat
that he is, stepped to the rescue of
the situation and nipped all discus
sion in the bud by submitting a mo
tion referring the petitions and the
J applications to the police committee
with power to act. Cavett seconded
tho diplomatic motion of Hayes and
the rumor of discord flew, frightened,
from the window, while the city clock,
never installed, silently ticked oft the
story of tho fleeting hours.

tondon. May 12. Immediately fol
lowing bis arrival here, Tremier As
Qtilth this morning ordered the post
ponement or court martial trials of
all rebels, pending the outcome of the
present situation, which is admittedly
becoming serious.
One of the first acts of Asquith was
to order a thorough investigation of
the execution, without trial, of Editor
Sherrington, whose killing has aroused
the greatest indignation.
It is conceded that the mosft dan
gerous factor which the British gov
ernment may -have to contend with,
that the first rising has been
summarily subdued, may be other up
risings, or serious revolts brought
about by the Irish populace resenting
the summary punishment meted, out
to the alleged leaders ot the rebel
lion. The Irish are known to be
a triditlonally warm-hearted and emo
tional people and the punishment of
the rebels may, it is conceded, bring
about a reaction of sympathy with dis
astrous results.
Following a fiery speech of John
Dillon, a highly respected nationalist,
in the house of commons, a speech
in which the government was bitterly
attacked, Premier Asyuith took the
reins in his own hands and proceeded
to Ireland- to personally conduct the
investigation of the rebellion. '

of guilty t ', the "charges in the in

ney, of stealing merchandise from the
cars in the Chickasha railway yards.
Judge Linn passed sentence upon the
defendant, giving him four years in the
state penitentiary at McAlester. Upon
dequest of the defendant tho court
ordered the service of the sentence to
date from Thursday, May 11.
Printy'tf thefts from the railway
cars were, it seems, confined to lift
ing sides of bacon and cans of lard
from the cold storage cars. The fruits
of his enterprise, it is alleged, was
sold to different members of the negro
population of Chickasha. Two negroes
charged with complicity in the thefes
arc now in jail awaiting trial. One of
these is the negro "Sonny" Smith, who
has given tho county and the city
a world of trouble during the past
several months.
Statements given out by officers at
tne jan say that there will be no
more prisoners taken from the Grady
county jail to the state prison until
the commissioners provide a means
of transportation for the prisoners
and the officers in charge. This state
ment, it is alleged, has been made
on account of the board of commi
sioners, acting upon the advice of the
representatives of the state inspection
department, refusing to reimburse the
sheriff's officers for traveling and
other expenses incurred in transport-
ng prisoners from Chickasha to Mc-
Alester, claiming, it is further alleged
that this indebtedness belongs to and
should be paid by the state.
Father ue Ville personally is round
ing up the great throng of young
sters. Bojs and girls, ranging from
2 and 3 to 13 years, are his quests.
Belgians and Belgian-Americans, liv
ing in the states, have supplied him
with the names and probable where

and grandchildren. All now are wait

shelter of their own wings.

In Alaska, some of the routes for

Washington, May 12. It is admitted
that this government is now confront
ed by a most serious situation as tha
result of the termination of the con
feernces, at El Paso, between General
Scott and General Obregon.
The termination of the EU aso
confeernces now puts all further ne
gotiations up to Washington for cabi
net consideration.
General Scott has been directed to
return to Washington, whila General
Funston is directed to repair to San;
Antonio. The next step of the admin
istration is conjectural.
It is feared that Carranzistas may
misconstrue the remaining of troops
Mexico as an avowed step against
Caranza. The main hope of solution is
that Caranza, though maintaining his
demand that American troops be with
drawn from Mexican soil, will remain
passive and not become active In tha
matter..

garded as sufficient and no moves, ex
cept those which may become nece
sary to meet changes io conditions,

Carranza Will Not Agree.
By United Press.
El Paso, May 12. The flat refusal
of General Carranza to accede to any
agreement not involving a definita
date for the withdrawal of the Amerl
con punitive expedition from Mexico,
has brought all negotiations to a sud
den ending.
It is apparent that General Scott
and General Obregan have reached a
point where an agreement becomes
impossible without violations of the
instructions from superiors. Such be
ing the case. General Obregon has re
turned to Mexico City. General Scott
expects to remain a few davs lone-er.
while General Funston hones to b
able to return to San Antonio immediately.
It seems now that all further ne-
gotiations may be conducted at Wash

make a last effort to settle the moot
ed questions between the United
States and Mexico. '
