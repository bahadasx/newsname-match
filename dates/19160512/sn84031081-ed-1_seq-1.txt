district within the last few
days, sounding out the people as to
whether they were ready to fight the
(Jutted States. The reply returned
t the headquarters of On. Arnulfo
Homes, active commander of (he
troops in northern Sonora, is said to
have -been that the people were ready
to fight and were only awaiting the
word.
"All is ready," is the word broUgh!
by emissaries to the commanders who
had sent them among the people.
Trust to Raiding ( Food.
The Mexicans are aware of the
fact that hostilities would mean the
catting off of their food supply as
well a Iheir source of ammunition
replenishment. However, they assert
in conversation among themselves
that raiding across the holder is nn
easy way to replenish their store of
food and they will have plenty to eat
under any circumstances.
Soldiers who have recently come
from th .south to the mobilisation
camps of the de facto troops in Cu
chuta, thirty-five miles south of here ,
and Fronteras, twenty-nine miles
south, are said to openly hoasl that
their commanders brought them
north to "whip the grlngoes," which
they consider an easy task.
Much Excitement In Town.
There is considerable excitement in
the towns along the Nacozari railroad
over the ordering of additional troops
to Douglas. This is especially true
among the soldiers, according to re
ports brought here today. Since. the
news that the Arizona national guard
and two battalions of the Fourteenth
infantry are coming, became known,
there has been mnrp talk of hostili
ties being opened In the immediate
future by the Mexicans than ever be
fore. This is not confined to the mil
itary but is talked among the civil
ians, It Is stuted by Americans.
Mexicans who have known and
spoken to Americans for manv gears
are reported as pussing their friends
without greeting.
Carted for iking "Gringo."
At Turicachi, a small Sonora town
"it the Nacozari railroad, a Mexican
girl went to the train with an Amer
ican to bid him goodbye. A captain
of the de facto army called her aside
nid cursed her, it is reported, asking
if she could not find a sweetheart bet
ter than a "gringo."
As the conference in El Paso ad
vanced and it became evident that the
American troops wore not to be with
drawn, feeling among the Mexicans
has become more bitter until an Out
break is threatened on the slightest
provocation, according to reliable
Americans.
Considerable uneasiness
among Americans in Sonora
is felt
over the
situation and it is their notion that
they will be forced to come to the
border within a week, or perhaps be
fore that time, according to arrivals.
Their friends here are quite appre
hensive over their safety.

Leading Nationalist Attacks
Government in Bitter Terms;
Asquith Steps Into the
Breach,
V MOnCINI JOU-OIAL SPECIAL LlAIO WINCI
London, May 11. The mosi dan
gerous factor in Ireland's situation,
which has been recognized since the
brief rising flashed in the pan, was
that the punishment of the rebels
would cause a reaction of sympathy
among the warmhearted and emo
tional people. This threatened dan
ger appears to be fast materializing.
John Dillon, one of the most re
spected of the nationalists, but often
one of the bitterest antagonists of
British rule, attacked the government
today In the house of commons In a
speech whic h, for bitter denunc iation,
has not been surpassed at Westmin
ster since I'arnell's clays
sipiilli to lii'laiul.
Premier Asquith has personally
stepped into the breach and is taking
the unprecedented eoum of Journey
ing to Dublin to investigate the sit
uation on the spot and doubtless to
give instruction to General Sir .I"hn
Maxwell regarding the policy which
the military government must pursue,
now that the chief civil administra
tors Lord Wimborne. Augustine llir
rell'and Sir Matthew Nathan, have
retired fmm office. The premier left
here tonight by the Irish mall train
on his way to that city.

part of a conciliator, and he now has
a task which is likely to demand their
utmost exercise. He announced that
he was geing to consult with the au
thorities In order to arrive at some
arrangement satisfactory to Irishmen
,,f all parties, and no statesman ever
attempted a harder achievement. He
frankly declared that the present sit
nation could not continue.

Dish Disarmament Planned,
The Marquis of LaOSdOWne intimat

be done depends on Sir Bdward ar

any other individuals.

The Infantry actions in the regions
of Verdun again have given way to;
artillery bombardments, the most ft
lent of which was directed against Ihej
Frenc h positions in the Paillette wood
and their second lines on the right j
bank of the Meuse. Homhardmetits I
also have taken place along the front
held by the llelglans and mining op-J
crations and artillery duels have pre-(
dominated on the Mritish front. Aj

tween the Ilrltish and Hermans.

Turks Report Victories.
Constantinople reports that in the
Caucasus region around Mount Hope
the Turks in an attack drove out the
Itussians from positions about nlnej
and one-half miles in etent and fore- j
ed them to retreat eastward, and like-1
wise to the southeast of Mamahntun
put the Russians to flight.
The Hermans, who were defeated
recently in the Kondoa-lrangi dls-j
triet of Hast Africa, have been rein
forced and now nre advancing on the
British. A dispatc h from the British
commander, however, says his troops
are quite sufficient to deal with the
Hermans.
The British government will permit, I
under certain stipulations, the feeling:

an American commission.
Hritish Government Censored,
The Hritish government in both
houses of parliament has come in for
much adverse criticism for its han-j
dling of the Irish situation, especially
for the executions that followed the
recent uprising.
Premier Asquith told the house of
commons that thirteen persons hud
been shot for participation in the re
volt, hut promised that court mar
tials in the cuse of murder churges
would be hereafter Conducted public
ly. The house of lords passed a resolu
tion expressing dissatisfaction with
the administration of Irish affairs.
Premier Asquith has left London for
Dublin to study the situation.

a special graduation exercise held at
College gymnasium Wednesday even
ing. When the order was served lor the
national guard to go on active duty
the president of the college called a
special faculty meeting and it was
unanimously decided, since the young
men would have completed satisfac
torily the courses they were pursuing,
that a special meeting should be held
and that the students should be grant
ed the honors which would have fall
en to them had the militia not been
called out.
After several miisicnl selections Dr.
George B. Ladd, president of the col
lege, told of the purpose of the meet
ing and directed a few helpful re
marks to the members of the national
guard who ate students of the col
lege. He was followed by Prof. J. II.

economics, with a short talk relative
to the crisis now existing between tin
United States and Mexico. He point
ed out the fact that all civilized coun
tries had reached their high plane of

Th" whole mutter was referred

diplomatic channels.

Tonight the situation la almost ex
actly where It stood before the con
ferences began. The Mexican govern-
incut still insists on the withdrawal of
, Henetal Pershing's i olumns upon a
c ertain date and wants that date to
come quickly. It Is known that Hen
icral Obrcgon has been willing to
' make concessions In ol der to reuch an
'agieemeiit with tho American confer-
iocs. RS has been overruled, however,
by tho flrsl chief, Venustlano Canan-

a half, however, they were brought to
an end. General Qaregen, aoehm
pfcnisd by .luiin M. Amador, Mexican
siibsecretary of foreign ' sffalrs,
merged from the private car occu
pied by Generals Hcott and Funston,
walked rap Id 1 down the railroad

Does Not Mean RUptUrC,
Tonight lt was pointed out authori
tatively that the result of the various
meetings in fi Paso doss not meun
that there la any immediate threat of
u rupture between the I'nlted States
and Mexico. So far as the United
Stales is concerned, It Is sulci, Its
army in the Mexican state of Chlhuu-
hua will remain perfectly Inactive.
The only break that can possibly
COme would follow an attack by Car
rancislas upon American troops.
it is understood that Oenerai ubre-
gon has been definitely warned thut
such an attac k will mark the begin
ning of reprisals.
Significantly enough conditions
along the border were p -emphasized
fonight by the receipt of dispatches
from Marathon, Tex., stating that
Mexican bandits hud again trussed
Inlo American territory and fired on
American, soldiers and civllluns.

Army men here refused to comment
on these occurrences except to state
that they were likely to be repeated
at Intervals.
With the negotiations here ended,
and the discussion reverting to Wash
