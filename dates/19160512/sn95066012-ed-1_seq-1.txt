$3,750,000 to Aid in Purchase of

New York. May 12 Cable de
patches from London last night an
nounced that through the efforts of
John P. Rockefeller, Jr., and the
Rockefeller Foundation and for the
ake of starving l'oland the British
loverninent has so far modified its
food blockade as to permit German
ships Hying a neutral flag to carry food
stuffs until October 1 to 3,000,000
tarving Poles.
(lermany on her part, has already
awed to contribute. 15.o0O.OU0 marks

this food, and she has engaged to feed
the 1:.', Oim.Oiio or more persons of Po
land and Russia now governed by her
nilitary staff. In addition she lends
the ships that will carry the food from
ew York and other ports to Danzig
on tho lialtic.
The one condition accepted on the
part of the allied and tho Central

control of a new Polish relief section

No one could estimate last night the
total cost of tills undertaking to tho
emulation or the full amount of food
that niav be necessary for the relief.
The sum contributed by Germany will
pin chase, it is figured, 20.000 tons of
foodstuffs for people who have suffer-

ifework of Nationalists Washed
iOut in Sea of Blood
MILITARY RULE DENOUNCED
If Government Had Not Been Dense
Irishmen Would Be Fighting For
Instead of Against the Empire.
London, May 11. The most danger
ous factor of the brief insii uprising,
reaction of sympathy among the peo
ple, seems now to be fast materializ
ing.
John Dillion. one of the most re-
pected of the notionalists, but often
one of the bitterist antagonists of Brit
ish rule, attacked the government to
day in the house' of commons in a
speech which, for bitter denunciation,
has not been surpassed at Westmins
ter since Darnell's days.
Mr. Dill Ion said the fact that nine out
f ten people in Ireland were on the
side of the government was due to the
lilcwork of the Nationalists, and now
the present rule was "washing cut that
ifework in a sea of blood."
Out of the whole of Ireland, Mr. Dil
lon continued, there were only four or
five spots where there was Insurrection
et the whole country was under mar
tial law and there was absolutely 110
trace of civil administration. The Ir'th
people, he declared, would reluse to ac
cept the well known high character of
leneral Maxwell as the sole guarantee
f their liberties, and if military rule
was to be continued the government
had better get ready 100,000 men to
arrison the country.
if the Pritisii people had not been
so dense, said Mr. Dillion, speaking on
his action, they oonll have had man

to rebelPon, but of ,.hose courage lu

Saviour of ltoslindale, was begun to
day in tho federal district court be
Tore Judge James M. Morton, Jr. This

has ever been tried in the federal
courts, in .Massachusetts.
The court room was crowded with
witnesses and spectators, a large num
ber of the latter being made tin of the
Rev. Mr. Wilson's parishioners. The
suit arose out of an alleged promise
to marry, said to have been made by
the Rev. Mr. Wilson in July, 1913,

Vermont as a special student. She took
rooms with a Miss Mabie at. Mrs.
Lane's on College street, owing to the
crowded conditions in the dormitories.
She first met the defendant at a New
Year's party at Fort Ethan Allen on
December 31, 1912. Mr. Willard said
the defendant had invited Miss John:
ton's roommate to the party, but be
came quite attentive to Miss Johnson
during the course of the evening.
Mr. Wilson made frequout calls on
Miss Johnson and in January declared
bis affections for her. the attorney
added. loiter in the same year, wheu
Mr. Wilson was in Arlington. Miss
Johnson called on him and he again
told lier of bis love. Mr. Willard went
on to tell how Miss Johnson could not
understand why the defendant did not
write to her. Then she wrote her
mother who came east and with the
plaintiff went to see Mr. Wilson in Ar
lington. Miss Johnson was left "alone
with the defendant who. on bended
knees," again declared his love for
her. Hut Mr. Wilson added that he
had had a higher call, that of celibacy.
She left him and next heard of him
when she received a newspaper clip-
ing from a friend, announcing the
defendant's engagement to another
woman.

"STAMPEDE" IN NEW YORK
"Two Bar Seventy" Hawks Will At
tend Cowboy Festival.
William P. Hawks contributes some
interesting reminiscences of tho early
west in the Sage Sayings columns, of
the Billboard in the May 13th issue.
"Two Par Seventy Hawks" is much
interested in the "Stampede," the big
cowboy and festival contest for the
the world's championships w hich is to
be held at Sheepshead Pay, N. Y., the
coming August. A number of wealthy
New York sportsmen have contributed
a large sum of money to defray the
expenses of bringing hundreds of
genuine old-time cowpunchers and
Indians to New York for a seven-day
tournament when the effeminate east
is to have the opportunity to see in
action some dyed-in the-wool western
ers of an age which is passed. Sever
al people from Pennington are going
down. Silver King, the long sought
leader of a wild horse herd in Idaho,
which Mr. Hawks personally chased
hundreds of miles over the deserts of
Idaho and which was finally captured
by a cowboy and bunch of Indians, is
to be on exhibition.
EXECUTED MEN MARTYRS
Shot Irishmen Take Place with Emmet,
Saye Shaw
London. May 10. George Bernard
Shaw, discussing the executions of the
Sinn Feiners in an open letter today
says:
"My view is that men who were shot
in cold blood after their capture or sur
render were prisoners of war, and it
therefore was entirely incorrect to
slaughter them. The relation of Ire
land to Dublin castle is in this respect
recisely the same as the Balkan states
toward Turkey, or Belgium toward the
Kaiser, or of the United States to Great
Britain.
Until Dublin castle is superseded by
a national parliament and Ireland Is
voluntarily incorporated with the
British empire like Canada, Australia
or South Africa, an Irishman restoring
to arms to achieve the independence of
his country is doing only what English
men will do if invaded and conquer-
d by the Germans. Such an Irishman
is as much morally in order in accept
ing assistance from the Germans, ns
England Is in accepting the assistance
of Russia in a struggle with Germany.
Hie fact that he knows his enemies
wiH 'not respect his rights if they
catch him. and that he must fight wita
rope around his neck, adds in some.
measure to his glory in the eyes of his
compatriots and in the eyes of disinter
ested admirers of patriotism through
out the world.
The slaughter of a man in this po
sition makes hiin a martyr and a hero.
The shot Irishmen will now take tneir
places beside Emmet and the Man-
hotter martyrs in Ireland, and beside
the heroes of Poland. Serbia and Bel
gium in Europe. Nohing in heaven
or earth can prevent it.
"I am not a Sinn Feiner. 1 have al
ways insisted it is the duty of Ireland
to throw itsilf with all its force
against the Germans and Austrlans.
Put I remain an Irishman and resent
any imputation that I can regard ns a
traitor any Irishman taken in a fight
for Irish independence against British
government."

Carranza Insists Date Be Fixed for

From Mexico.
Brownsville, Texas, May 11. Curtis
Payles. an American fanner, was shot
and killed late tonight a short dis
stanee from his home near Mercedes,
Texas, by a band of four or five Mexi
cans who succeeded in escaping, pre
sumably to the Mexican side of the
Rio Grande. :
El Paso, Tex., May 11. After al
most two weeks of discussion the con
ferences of General Hugh L. Scott,
Frederick Funston and General Al
varo Obregon, Mexican minister' of
war, over American troop dispositions
in Mexico, came to an end tonight
without an agreement. The whole
matter was referred back to tho
American and de facto governments to
be settled through diplomatic chan
nel;1.. ;
Tonight the situation is almost ex
actly where it stood before the con
ferences began.. The Mexican gov
ernment stillinsists on the with
drawal ot General Pershing's
columns on a certain date, and
wishes that date to come quickly.
It u known General Obregon has
been willing to make concessions In
order to reach an agreement with the
American conferees. He has been
overruled, however, by the first chief,
Venustlano Carranza, and his advis
ers. After practically conceding the
demands of the American conferees,
he was compelled to reverse his atti
tude. The end of the negotiations came
today alter two conferences. The
first began at 10 o'clock in the morn
ing and lasted until 1 o'clock when a
recess was taken until 4 o'clock to
permit General Obregon to keep a
lunch engagement. Sharp on the
hour the discussions were renewed.
After two hours and a half, however,
they were brought to an end.
