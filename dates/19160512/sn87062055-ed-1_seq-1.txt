The Elk Celebration committee has
been extremely active during the past
few weeks and have been endeavoring
to secure attractions for their Fourth
of July celebration which vary all the
way from aviation stunts by celebrat
ed wing men to the champion rough
riders of the world. A strong effort
is being made to secure the services
of an aviator to put on an exhibition
on the Fourth, .but deflnate arrange
ments have not as yet been made.
James Swinncrton, the famous ar
tists, who knows the Indians, will en
deavor to have the largest bunch of
Indians in Flagstaff during the two
days that were ever seen so close to a
railroad before. And, Jim, he will.
The committee have not started out
with the purpose of merely having an
ordinary Fourth of July celebration,
but intend to make the two days the
biggest and best days of cosmopoli
tan entertainment for the people of
the north that ever happened. A M"9er
camp, a street of entertainers a block
long local entertainers, no cheap
street carnival stuff; young zebras all
in stripes, the wuffwuff of India and
many other strange things that the
average Arizonnn has never seen.
The committee as finally made up
by the executive committee arc as
follows:

Dcd at County Hospital
Jack Bushnell, thc blacksmith, died
at the county hospital yesterday
mornint, as a result of blood Doison-
n. in his hand which was infected
some months ago. He had suffered
untold agony from blood poisoning
which resulted from a small scratch
on his little finger while shoeing a
horse. He improved slightly after the
worst attack was over, was out and
around for a short time, then taken
to the county hospital for treatment.
Surgeons agreed that the arm should
be amputated, but he absolutely re
fused to have the operation perform
ed, preferring death rather than be
ing a helpless cripple.
He was a native of Wales and has
no known relatives here.
A small fire in ie Brannen addi-
tion near thc F. L. M. mill occurred
Wednesday night, but was extingu

There was a- most interesting mass
meeting at the court house in Flag
staff last Saturday evening when over
a hundred interested citizens met
there to assist in selecting councilmcn'
for the city ticket to be elected on
May 22nd.
The meeting was called to order by
Mayor Francis and on motion Dan J.
Cronin was made chairman of the
meeting, with Tom L. Rees as secre
tary. After the object of the meeting was
stated it was" moved that twenty
names be submitted and placed upon
a blackboard to be -voted for for the
purpose of selecting fourteen names!
two full city tickets. Under the)
mica ui uiu game as iaia down tne i
following nominations were made

TEACHERS SELECTED FOR
016 EMERSON SCHOOL
One of the big jobs recently almost
completed is that of thc trustees of
the Emerson school in selecting of
I. . . "
teachers for the coding year. At a
rcccnt mcetln. of thc board of trus.
tecs, consisting of Tom L. Rees. G.
T- Herrington and J. P. Wilson, the
following tcachers were elected' for
the coming year:
0. H. Richardson, principle.
Mrs. Bertha Kennedy, eighth grade.
Miss Marvine Francs, seventh
grade.
Miss Rcgina Meek, sixth grade.
.Miss Lura Kinsey, fifth grade.
.Miss Leslie Mayflower, fourth
grade.
Miss Elsie B. Jordan, third grade.
Miss Elsie Stevenson, second grade.
Miss Ethel Dcibcrt, first grade.
Miss Verna
Metcalf, music and
drawing.
Miss Elizabeth Watkins, domestic
science and art.
There still remains a vacancy in
the first grade set apart for the Mexi-.
I con children which will be filled later.
The general impression is that the,
Emerson school faculty is equal to
any it ever hnd, with a prospect of a
most successful school year to come.
Prof. Richardson has proven hlm-
scu a man oi exceptional ability in
the line of education and there have .
been few, if any complaints against1
his work in past years; he has hnr-l
monized and promoted the interests '
of the school with the minimum of ,
friction.

Will Go to Idaho to Live
Mr. Herbert Hilkins and family are ,
preparing to leave Flagstaff the first
of thc month for Pocatello, Idaho,
where Herbert has secured a position
with thc packing department of a big
meat packing company. He has held
on thc place as manager of the Bab
bitt plant for a number of years and
Is an indefatigable worker who is
thoroughly familiar with his business
of handling meat from the slaughter
house to thc block and the many
friends the family has made here sin
cerely regret they are leaving for a
new field of labor.
Released for War Duty
Frank Kuhcn, a member of Co. I
and one of the best shots in the Ari
zona regiment, was released by Judge
Perkins on a suspended sentence last
Wednesday morning, in order that he
could join his company and go to the
border with the boys.
Kuhcn had been arrested on charge
of bootlegging sometime ago and
while the charge had not been proven,
he agreed to plead guilty provided he
was allowed to go with his company.
He was given a suspended sentence
and was mighty well pleased to join
the boys of his company again.
ticket The names of the candidates
as drawn on thc two tickets were as
follows:
First ticket:
0. H. Richardson,
0. H. John,
S. L. Finley,
J. C. Brown,
Ray Babbitt,'
C. W. Heiser,
S. F. Quay.
Second ticket: '
V. M. Sliphcr,
E. M. Robison,
T. A. Rickel,
T. C. Frier,
W. E. Berg,
J. C. Dolan,
W. W. Hudgings.
Since thc result of the mass meet-
ing, A. W. Bikker has circulated a
petition for a nomination on another
' ticket and is seeking for thc support
of the people; no other nominee has
been hnnrd nf nnrl it ic inn Into - n.-t
on the printed ticket, the above
names, including Mr. Bikker, will be
the candidates for the next city coun-
cil. If voters desire it is within
their province to write in the name
of any person they wish to elect to
the office of councilman and it will
have to be counted, but such a candi-
date would be handicaped by reason
of thc fact that his name will not
appear on the printed ballot.
Our only admonition
is it is a
most important year: elect thc best
men according to your judgment.
PROMINENT OFFICIALS
VISIT LOCAL FORESTS
District Forester Reddington ac-
-m-nnin.l Y,r V H U T-1- f 4k-
district office, went through Flagstaff
Tuesday evening on their way back
to headquarters from a visit to the
Saginaw & Manistee logging camps
north of Bellcmon.. Forest Supervi-
sor Chad Hinderer of the Prescott
national forest, accompanied by For
est Supervisor Guthrie, Mr. Butler,
Supervisor Jos. Kircher, of the Santa
Fc national forest and Quincy Rey
nolds, expert lumberman, had been
out investigating local conditions and
cuttings on that section of the forest
for a couple of days. They seemed
well satisfied with the conditions as
found throughout the two forests
Supervisor Hinderer remained over n
couple days in Flagstaff on
. business.
This section of the country seemed
, like home to all of them except Dis-
trict Forester Reddington and Mr.
Butler. Mr. Reddington has been in
the forest service for a long time,
but was recently transferred to this
district from California; Mr. Butler
will take the place vacated by Mr.
Kircher who had charge of thc timber
sales in the district.
Smallpox Cases Released at Williams
t
lne lwo canoaus oi Mexicans who
have becn in quarantine at Williams
for the past three weeks were fumi
gated thoroughly last Tuesday by
County Health Officer Manning and
allowed to proceed on their way
again.
Therc werc onlv two cascs amonS
thcm; both victims havin brokcn out
with the disease at the time they
reached Williams,
Luckily none of the others of the
108 men in thc two cars contracted
the disease though the had been
thoroughly exposed to It. Strenuous
measures had a good deal to do with
eradicating it.
The two cases of the disease at
Canyon Diablo are getting along nice
ly and Dr. Manning says that ho be
lieves that he will be able to fumigate
their surroundings and raise the quar
antine there by today.
Normal Students Leaving for Home

PROBABILITY OF MANY
NEW BUSINESS BUILDINGS
. .;.
The biggest and most import-
ant sale of city real estate of the
year was made last week when
T. E. Pollock purchased the
John W. Francis corner, one of
J the most prominent and most
! sought after corners in the city
for business purposes. The price
paid was close to $15,000 for the
corner, which is centrally located
and just opposite the Arizona
Central bank on Leroux street.
A number of people, both in and
outside of Flagstaff have made
! offers for the corner in the past
two years without securing it,
I and it seemed to be a keystone to
some sort of development In the
city.
' Mr. Pollock refused to divulge '
any special reason for the pur-
chose other than he had made the
! purchase because he wanted the
property and might later put up
a string of business buildings on
it. The location is a good one
for any kind of business.

ACCURATE SURVEY OF
THE CITY BEING MADE
A re-location survey is being made
by Assistant City Engineer R. Os

all thc old survey stakes that were
set some thirty seven years ago by
the original surveyor of the town.

Bass Fishing at Lake Mary
George Attcbury, a huckleberry far

a nice string of two pound bass which
he claims were caught in Lake Mary
Tuesday. Mr. Attebury says that

Engineer May Loose Eyesight
Engineer Tooker on-the Grand Can
yon railroad, met with an accident
Monday that may cost him his eye
sight. In handling an automatic
pistol while off duty Monday the gun
went off unexpectedly while he was
holding it close to his face ,the ex
ploding .powder struck him in the
eyes blinding him, temporarily at
least. The exact nature of his in
juries had not been learned before he
was taken to the Santa Fe hospital
in Los Angeles.
Company I of Flagstaff, ' together
with the rest of the Arizona regiment
received orders Tuesday to get in
readiness for duty on the border to
assist in protecting it from bandit
raids or for any other duty that may
come up, including a dash into old
Mexico should thc occasion arise.
The National Guard will be federal
troops and be made a part of the re
gular army for this duty.
Captain Robison has been doing
strenuous duty since receiving the
order to get ready and has enlisted
a number of old soldiers as well as
new recruits for the company.
Up to Wednesday night he had re
ceived no marching orders, but was
expecting them at any time. New
Mexico and Texas National Guard
troops have received the same wait
ing orders and it is understood that
it is the first intention of the presi
dent to relieve the troops on the bor
der who have been stationed there
with the state troops, or rather
Guard troops who will be regulars
when they are sworn into the service
at Douglas, the point where the regi
ment will be sent first
Their first assignment will probably
be border duty but may terminate in
a march on Mexico unless there if a
marked change in the attitude of the
Carranza government.
The National Guard of the three
I border states, Arizona, New Mexico
and Texas, will be the first volunteers
on the line to follow up whatever ac
tion is taken by the regular army,
other state troops from the north will
have to follow them into action.
There is little doubt but they will
be called into action within a short
time.
Captain Robison received orders
late Wednesday night from Adjutant
General Harris to have Company I in
, Phoenix by this morning, there to
join the othcr companies of lhc regi.
ment mobilized there. From Phoenix

WHOLESALE ARRESTS MADE
FOR SELLINC LIQUOR
Night Marshal Alsup made nume-
rous arrests on charges of bootleg-
hall on Railroad avenue was arrested
on charge of selling liquor with two
counts against him. He gave bond
for $750 and will be tried today.
John Proctor was also one of the
unlucky number, arrested on one
charge of selling booze. He was held
under bonds of $5Qp and will stand
trial today.
Pedro Paladini and A. Gonzales
pled guilty and were fined $50 each,
which they paid.
Marshal Alsup Is Arrested
Night Marshal Alsup came in next
for his share of the trouble and was
arrested on complaint of John Proctor
who claimed Alsup made undue use
of his gun when he met him on thc
street at about 8 o'clock at night.
Proctor claims that Alsup pulled his
gun without provocation and stuck
the point of it into his stomach. Other
witnesses stated that while Alsup did
have his gun in hand when approach
ed by Proctor and a couple more men,
but did not point it at any of them.
The case was on trial late yesterday
afternoon before Judge Harrington
and a jury.
A crowd of nearly a thousand peo
ple, on foot and with autos decorated
with American flags and the band
gave Co. I a good send off with plen
ty of enthusiasm last night as they
left in a special car for the border.
