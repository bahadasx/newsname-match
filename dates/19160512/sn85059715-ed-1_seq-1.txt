EX-GOVERNOR WHITE
ANGERS DEMOCRATS
When He Exposes Course of
the Administration and De
nounces Its Policies.
Formor Governor Albert B. Whito,
of Pnrkersburg. Thursday night kept
his speaking engagement here as an
nounced in the Telegram from time
to time. It was clalme'd that Mio
meeting had not been jib extensively
advertised as It should have been,
and the presumption Is, If that bo
true, that his local publicity commit
tee was too busy at something lese
and fell down on the Job.
The crowd was a disappointment
as to sizo but very good In quality.
I. Wade Coffman, clerk of the cir
cuit court and secretary of the He
publican county executive committer,
called the meeting to order and made
a few suitable introductory remarks.
He called William H. Taylor to the
presiding chair and the latter Intro
duced Governor White In a fitting
manner.
Governor Whfto the nspoke for his
candidacy for the party nomination
for United States senator. The gov
ernor denounced the Wilson adminis
tration and Its various policies, in
cluding the present tariff law, the
foreign policies, the repeal of the
Panama canal toll law and various
other things of omission and com
mipslon on the part of the Democratic
party. Governor White is a brilliant
campaigner and no Republican speak
er In this state can get the Democrat
ic goat like he does. Almost from
the first word of his address he had
every Democrat present not only up
In the air but as mad as a wet hen.
Judge George W. Atkinson, billed
to speak also, was unable to be pres
ent.

BURGLARS GET HAULS
AT TWO MORE STORES
POVERTY
Is Closely Related to Tubercu
losis According to Health
Service Report.
Safe is Cracked at Craigmoor
and Hard's Place at O'Neil
is Visited.
WASHINGTON, May 12.?Tbe closo
relation of poverty to tuberculosis Is
emphasized In a report made today by
tbe public health service after an ex
tensive Investigation In many cities.
Ohe-slxth of all tuberculosis cases It
discovers develops In cbeap lodging
houses and one-fifth are traceable to
occupational hazards and bad work
ing conditions.
"The great factor underlying the
entire problem," Bays the report, "Is
seemingly that of economic condi
tions."
As examples statistics gathered In
Cincinnati and Pittsburg are cited. In
the former city's tenement district
tuberculosis morbidity was found to
be three times as great as in the bet
ter section and tbe average monthly
Income of 197 familios In which cases
were found was computed as $57. Much
of the same condition was discovered
In Pittsburg where nearly BO,000 fac
tory workmen submitted to physical
examination In the course of the in
vestigation.
Burglars broke Into Queen's gen
eral store at Craigmoor some time
Thursday night, cracked a safe and
carried'ofT several hundred dollars In
money and a quantity of merchan
dise. A call was relayed over the
miserable telephone system that ex
ists In that part of the county, to
the sheriff's office here with a request
for the sheriff's bloodhounds and
Deputy Sheriff Wolfe at once took
the dogs to the scene.
Another Harrison county store was
also visited by burglars the same
night, as that of Luther Hurd at
O'Neil. Tbe loot there consisted of
about $3 In cash taken from a cash
till and an assortment of merchan
dise. One sack containing nine pa.rs
of shoes, which had been selected
from the stock, was left behind by
the burglers. Entrance was gained
by crawling under the building, nor
Ing holes in the floor and cutting out
two or three boards. Request was
made for Sheriff Ross F. Stout's
lilood hounds, but they had previous
ly been engaged at Craigmoor."
WARRANTS ARE DISMISSED.
At the request of M. O. Davis, the
complainant, warrants charging Pago
BuBh. Luchle Walker, Floyd Black
shire, Halbert Crlss and Bryan Crlss,
young men of Tin Plate, with felon
