IS DANGEROUS FACTOR
IN IRISH SITUATION
Prime Minister Shows Prowess as
a Conciliator, But Now Has
a Tough One.
London, Eng., May 11.—The most
dangerous factor in the Irish situa­
tion, which has been recognized since
the brief uprising flashed in the pan,
was that the punishment of the rebels
would cause a reaction of sympathy
among the warmed hearted and emo­
tional people. This threatening dan­
ger appears to be fast materializing.
Jack Dillon, one of the most re­
spected of the Nationalists but often
one of the most bitterest antagonists
of the British rule attacked the gov
ernrncn:. today a speech, which for
itter denunciation, has not been sur­
passed in West minister since Par
nell's days.
Premier Asquith personally has
stepped into the breach and has taken
the unprecedented course of journey­
ing to Dublin to investigate the situa­
tion there and doubtless to give in­
structions to Gen. Sir. Maxwell, re­
garding the policy, which the military
government must pursue, since the
chief leader administrators, Lord
Winbornc, Austine Birrell and Sir
Matthew Nathan, have retired from
office. The Frontier left tonight by
the Irish mail train on' his way to
Dublin.
Mr. Asquith once before took the
veins in his own hands in a crisis by
assuming the secretaryship of war
when the Ulster outbreak in 1914
caliped the resignation of Col. Seely.
The 'Prime Minister's finest powers
Lave been displayed in playing the
part of a conciliator and he now has
a taBk which is likely to dem.and
iftWf Tittftofct axercJs^v ari*fttm^ed
that he was going to consult with the
authorities in ofdef to ftrrlfeat some
arrangement satisfactory to Irishmen
of all partieR and no statesman ever
attempted- it more difficult achieve­
ment. He declared frankly that' the
present situation could not continue.
Many, of the newspapers, particularly
the 'Liberal' brgans, call upon the Irish
factidns to seize the present' oppor­
tunity'for settling the difficulties.

THIRTY-SIXTH YEAR, NO. 114 (NEW8 OF THE WORLD)
AMBASSADOR'S PLAN
The British government has just
announced its acceptance of the plan
submitted by Walter Hines Page, the
American Ambassador for feeding the
population of Poland by an American
commission.
The acceptance carries, however,
certain rather difficult stipulations ifor
the Central Powers that the relief
must be applied to that portion of
iPoland in Austrian occupation and
not confined, as Germany desires, to
that part occupied by Germany. It
is stipulated that the food is to be
shipped from the t'nited States in
Gerrtrfth ships under a neutral flag,
and that Germany and Austria, agree
as part of the scheme, to care prop­
erty for the population of Serbia, Al­
bania and Montenegro'.
GOING TO DUBLIN
Premier Asquith left the Euston
Station tonight on board the Irish
mail train on his way to Dublin.
'Disarm Ireland.
The Marquis of Lansdowne intimat­
ed to the house of lords that the dis­
armament 6f ail Ireland will be un­
dertaken. This would mean the dis­
armament of the Ulster and National­
ist volunteers, and whether that can
be done depends on Sir Edward Car­
son and Mr. Redmond more than on
any other individuals.
The house' negatived without divi­
sion the Dillon motion demanding
that the government should immedi­
ately declare its intention. The hou|t
of lords adopted .without division,
Lord 'Loreburn's motion expressing
dissatisfaction with the government
management of Ireland.
Criticise Execution*.
The British government in both
houses of parliament has come in for
much adverse criticism for its han­
dling of the Irish situation, especially
for the executions that followed the
recent uprising.
Premier Asquith told the house of
commons that 13 persons had been
shot for participation in the revolt,
he promised that courtmartials in the
case of further charges would be pub­
licly be conducted hereafter.
The Louse of lords adopted a res­
olution 'expressing dissatisfaction
with the administration of Irish af­
fairs. Premier Asquith has left Lon­
don for Dublin, to study the situation.
Resume Verdun Action.
The infantry action in the region
of Verdun again has given way to ar­
tillery foomoardments. Bombard­
ments also have taken place along
the front held by the Belgians and
mining operations and artillery duels
have predominated on the British
fronts. A severe artillery duel is in
progress around the Hohenzollern re­
gion between the British and (Ger­

READY TO START
ALL OVER AGAIN
General Scott's Official Report Is
Expected to Arrive at Wash­
ington Today.
Washington, D. C., May 11.—While
no official report from Gen. Scott had
arrived tonight that his conference
with Gen. Obregon had failed to bring
about an agreement as to the border
situation, it was clear that the admin­
istration officials after reading the
news dispatches did not regard the
failure as producing a critical situa­
tion between the United States and
Mexican de facto government. Gen.
Scott' was^ expected to prepare a full
report for President Wilson, which
should reach Washington in time for
the Cabinet meeting tomorrow.
Moth department officials and Elisio
Arredondo the Mexican ambassador
designate, have been prepared to re­
sume the task of the border situation
at the point where the diplomatic
questions were suspended when mili­
tary conferences was arranged.
The ambassador called at the State
Department today to talk over the
general situation with Secretary Lan­
sing. 1 Te is understood to have reit­
erated the argument of Gen. Carranza
in urging early withdrawal of the
American troops from Mexico.
Mr. Arredondo previously has said
that the,failure.of Generals Scott and
Obregon to reach an understanding
in no way affects the diplomatic prob*
lent.
NOT FULLY ADVISED
Officials of the administration have
not: been advised fully of the discus­
sions in El Paso, and necessarily will
need reports from General Funston
and Scott in order to know how to
Pli'^iUea* :Wfch..t.b«./i!l«8Uon. of siting

troops.
The fact11hat unofficial reports came
tonighl of a new raid is considered
proof that General Pershing's task
has not been completed. There is
every reason to,believe his force will
remain in Mexico until it has been
completed and that no amount of argu­
ment. by Gen. Carranza will bring a
change in that determination.
When the military conference was
arranged, the State Department had
taken no sleps toward preparing an
answer to Carranza's note suggesting
withdrawal of the troops. It will be
a month tomorrow since that com­
munication was received. Officials
seemed inclined not to make any
haste in taking up the question.

Against Ban
On Supplies
Washington, May 11.—The Ameri­
can government is preparing to pro­
test against the British government's
refusal to allow permission of the use
of the Red Cross hospital supplies to
Cennany.
Mr. Taft's letter revealed for the
first time that Great Britain formally
had declined to issue permit for ship­
ments of supplies to ihe Central Pow­
ers, except when intended for Ameri
can hospital units. This acceptance,
Mr. Taft wrote, was worthless, on ac­
count of the lack of funds the Red
Cross had maintained no units in the
belligerent countries since last Oc
tober.
The Red Cross considers the atti
tilde of the British government in
violation of the Ceneva conference, in
which the Great iBritain government
and the American government were
participants.

Messages from the sea today by wire

Ship, Roanoke, which went down
Tuesday in a gale off the California
coast, with a possible loss of from
4G to 50 lives. Several steamships

men, who may have 'been lost in the
disaster. The iRoanoke, bound for
Valparaiso from San Francisco, car­
ried no passengers, except Mrs. Rich­

the captain of the steamer. Captain
Dickson planned to retire after this
voyage and he took Mrs. Dickson
with him, he said, because it was to
be the last.

night, bringing news of the disaster,
Baid five lifeboats were launched and
that he saw two of them swamped

A number of prominent E'ismarck

FARM BUILDINGS
WERE DESTROYED
Jamestown, N. D., May 11.—The big
new barn, the granary, and the chick­
en house on the farm of Joseph Kos
sack, living near Medina, were totally
destroyed by fire Sunday afternoon
during the high wind.
Kossack had burned a straw stack
about a quarter of a mile west of
his barn a few days before and it
was still smouldering when the high
wind arose and fanned the sparks
into flames. About 10 a. m. Sunday,
Kossack discovered the fire creep­
ing through the heavy layer of straw
on the ground toward the barn and
notified the neighboring farmers of
the trouble. A crowd of men and
boys gathered and they worked des­
perately to head off the fire, but as
they would lift up a fork full of
straw, the fire would jump to another
"spot and spread rapidly. The chemi­
cal engine from Medina was called
out but" at 2:30 in the afternoon the
fire reached the barn and in less than
twenty minntes the big building 60 by
100 feet, collapsed in flames.

El Paso, Tex., May 11.—After »1
most two weeks of discusBion the con­
ferences of General Scott', Funston and
Obregon, over American troop disposi­
tion in Mexico came to an end to­
night without any agreement being
reached.
The entire matter was referred
back to the American and de facto
governments to be settled through
diplomatic channels.
Tonight the situation is almost ex*
actly what it was before the confer­
ences began, the Mexican govern­
ment still insists on the withdrawal
of Gen. Pershing's columns on. a cer­
tain date and wants that date to be
soon. It is claimed that Gen. Obre­
gon had been willing to make conces­
sions in order to reach an agreement
with the American conferees, init
that he was overruled by the first
chief, Veniestanio Carranxa and his
advisers.

Gen. Obregon was compelled to re­

end of the conferences came today,
after two conferences had been held.
The first began at 10 o'clock in tho
morning and lasted until 1 o'clock,
when a recess was taken until
o'clock to permit General Obregon to
keep a luncheon engagement. After-,
two and a half hours, they woro^'
brought1 to an end.
The Mexican sub-secretary of for*
eign affairs emerged from the private
car, accompanied by General^ Scott
and Funston, and walked rapidly
down the railroad track and climbed
into his waiting automobile and drove
away.

General Funston re-entered the car,
and Col Robert E. Lee Michie, aide

tributed copies of the following state­
ment' to the waiting newspapermen.
"We wish to announce that after
