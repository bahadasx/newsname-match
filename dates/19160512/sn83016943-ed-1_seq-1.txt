Mr. and Mrs. Wilkins'
Golden Wedding.
IMit.tr of the Br:'ON:
A few day a aco I received an invita
tion to attend the 5t)lh Anniversary
(Golden Weddinp) of my pood friend
Tom Wilkins and his wife. A little
later I received a letter from his band
some, whole-souled, hospitable daughter
to come up, take supper with her, tfo
out to her father's with her and tell
the good people of her father's war
record. For while we did not belong
to the same reeiment, he being in the
11th and I in the 19th, we were both in
the Army of Northern Virginia, under
the immortal Lee. I could not resist
this invitation, as I greatly desire to
honor any of my old comrades by talk
ing of the part they played in the
brave old days of 'til and 'Co.
I arrived on the grounds early and
found a goodly crowd already as
sembled, among others my old comrade
Gus McDonald, who served with me in
that grand old company known as
"Company A. llth Miss." Tom was
in full feather, and bis wife is one of
tie handsomest old ladies 1 ever saw
right close to Sallie. I had appointed
Tom as Major on my staff and asktci
him why lie had not gotten his uniform
so as to have worn it on this occasion.
But he said he had very few uniforms
during the war, and were he to have
worn the uniform like he did in the
war, he would have had to have kept
his face to the crowd all the time as
his pants were generally ventilated in
trie back. He was dressed up about as
well as I ever saw him, collar of hit
shirt too small but tied with a good
stout string, and he was as happy as if
he had on broadcloth. I think the war
must have helped Tom, for I don't
think he was ever very far away from
home before the war broke out, as he
told me his good wife was raised in a
half mile of him, and she said that she
reckoned it must have been three or
four miles from his house, and I said
"Of course you were all schoolmates"
and she said "No." So I suppose. Tom
never got out of his back yard, and 1
really believe that the first pair of
r ants he ever wore whs when he went
to the army, for as Bill Arp says,
"W'hen caiico strikes a boy he washes
his neck and ears and puts a little per
fume on himself without being told."
At any rate, hd was not long in finding
her after the war, fur they were mar
ried the loth of May, 'flu, and a
Grandma used to say, "When Tom
married this good lady he certainly had
on the Silver Slipper."
Tom had learned to forage during
the war, and as the Yankee govern
ment was taking all the cotton from
us, old Tom must have helped Uncle
Sam gather a little of it, having a
premonition that it would be a lung
time coming bacK to us, for allhougn
he got home with tvi rest of us in
1SGG, with hardly a shirt to his back
and no time to make a crop, when lie
married he dropped one hundred twen
ty dollar gold pieces in his wife's lap
as a bridal present. Well 1 asked Tom
where he got in, but he said 1 always
did ask too many questions anyway.
Tom and his brothers enlisted in the
' spring of 'CI and that company became
a part of the famous lltti Mississippi.
They received their bautism of fire at
First Manassas, and was under fire
pretty much of the time until that
company was wiped out in the fatal
charge at Gettysburg. General
Stephen D. Lee wrote an article on the
I'raihe Guards a few years before ins
death, and slated that out of twenty
nine men that reported for duty on
that fateful day, only one-John Mor
gan of our county, answered the roil
call the next morning. The rest of
them were killed and wounded. The
Wilkina' immoitalued themselves on
that day, for two of them were bhot
dead and Tom badly wounded.
This is the record that any family
might be proud of, and I have always
been so proud of the record that the
V'ilkins boys made, both in war and in
peace, that when John Cavett got to
courting one of the Wilkins girls and
h 8 auto broke down, I told him to
come and get mine, and never to give
up the drive, that I wanted him to be
like the old Cumberland preacher we
had once, when holding protracted
meeting in the summer he would sing
out:-"Doii't fan the mourners,"
Tom Wilvins and his wife have done
great things for the country and scale,
for they have raised six boys and one
girl that are an honor to any county
and state in the Union, and any couple
who have done thit., thereby cstabhbh
ii.g nucleus for one-half dozen excel
lent families, deserves well of thih
country. Madame de Stael once asked
the groat Napoleon what woman de
served the thanks of France the most,
find Niipoleon replied;-. "The woman
who has raised tne most sjr.s for her.
I told him in the little talk that I made
"That when I looked at the children
that Tom Wilkins and his wife have
raised, and the other fine young men
and girls who had assembled there last
night, that I w.n more opposed than
ever to paying out any money to in
duce immigrants to come to our coun
try, 1 would welcome the coming of
any good, honest man and woman who
come on their own volition to cast
their lots with us and help us fill up
Ihe waste places, but I would be dog
gone if I would be willing to pay one
cent for anyone to move in our 'midst.'
We had a great crowd at the Golden
Wedding last night and I don't think
this assemblage of fair women and
brave men could have been beaten
anywhere, and everything went as
merry as the traditional marriage bell.
Brother J. J. Baird made a most suita
ble talk to the bride and groom, and
the singing led by Tom's nephew, Wirt
Wilkins, was excellent. When they
sung "Long Ago," my mind went
back over the fifty years - that had
elapsed since this good couple were
married, and I could hardly refrain
from tears when I thought of all the
dear men and women who had married
like Torn and I did in the CO's soon
after the uar, and who had now 'gone
io their last bonus for very few of
those brave young men who survived
the war and young ladies who married
Lhem are now in the land of the living.
The presents were numerous and
splendid, but as I don't believe in giv
ing or receiving presents on these occa
sions, I did not carrv one. This is a
custom that has grown up since the war,
that I don't believe in. John Tyson
showed me his present, a beautiful pair
of cuff buttons. Well, if I had had a
pair of cull' buttons and had no more
U;0 lor them than John had, 1 might
have carried a pair myself, I think
lolm bought these when he. married
his present, pood wife, for soon after
that event I met John on the fain with
his wife and he had a pair of cull's on
anil lie lookid utterly miserable, a.id 1
told .Mrs. Tyson that 1 loved John and
nlei.se not wake him wear those cull
buttons any mare, and lie tells me that
the has ex'-used him from that day to
this, but I wonder what old Tom Vii-
kuis is going to do with them. j
Wc were t'l served nVhghtful cream
and cake, anil while Mrs. Wilkins was
less demonstrative than old Tom, I am
sure she too, enjoyed it to the utmost.
Totn told me that the good people of
Brook-vide were going lo aid the Nox
ubee Kille ihapttr of ihe U. I. C's to
entertain tne Noxnhee County Camp ot
(Jonfee,. rate vel'-r.iiiS on the lOtli pi
September, Tom's birthday, and I an.
sure thov will greatly api.reci.Ue this
event, for Urocksviite never does any
thing mill-way and i Know we will be
Weil entertained.
Well's here's hoping that Tom Wil
kins and his bomne bride will celt Orate
many more anui vrsanes and l.e spared
lor a king time, and bo a living exam
ple that "I'.larriage is Not a failure. '

This is to call the attention of all
automobile drivers to the city ordin
ance regulating the speed, etc., of

There are some who are inclined to
take advantage of the leniency shown

I take this means of warning those
who are violating the ordinance against
further violation.
I am not a fanatic on this subject,
but I intend to exert every effort to
make the automobile drivers stay with

The Troubles of England
Each of the countries at war
has its peculiar troubles, military
or economic, to contend with;
some of the troubles can be miti
gated or even overcome by
patient and patriotic efToit;
others grow worse as the contest
proceeds.
Take the case of Great Britain,
Its greatest difficulties are the
result of the national character,
which however alert Britons
may be in other matters is per
ilously sluggish in respect of any
war in which the nation may be
engaged- Englishmen from
time immemorial have felt that,
since they lived on an island,
they were secure from invasion.
As long as their navy was the
most powerful afloat they had no
fears. So the war found them
with only a small standing army
and the ordinary Briton has only
now begun to realize that, if his
country is to be successful in this
war, it must have just such an
army as its continental neighbors
have. Hence the long and tedi
ous wrangle over tne tardy vol
unteer recruiting, the frantic op
position to compulsion and the
vain disputes about the respect
ive duties of single and married"
men Meanwhile, the great
army that Great Britain needs is
not even yet created.
More than once also, the busi
ness of munitioning the army
that has been raised has been
delayed and confused by the at
titude of organized labor. In
time of war the nation can exei t
itself effectively only when
I private or class interests yields

to the-'.'demand of patriotism
But tne labor unions have hesi-
fr";i; i)r!ru
enange or suspenu lueir rtues,
feartul, no doubt, lest they
should thus surrender rights or
privileges that were not easily
wen and that might not be re
stored after the war without an
other struggle. The lives of the
men at the front and the safety
of England itself depend on
driving the work in mine, factory
and shipyard; but the unions
have yielded to the necessity
with grudging reluctance, and
sometimes only under, strong
government pressure. It is all a
part of the price that England
pays for insisting on individual
liberty rather than on national
discipline.
The crisis through which the
United Kingdom is passing is to
prove whether such a country
can rise to the supreme test of a
great war without sacrificing
any essential part of its political
creed.
Moreover Great Britain has its
internal enemies, and 'more than
one group of half-hearted citi
zens who are more inclined to
criticize and obstruct than to
help. It has confined all the
aliun enemies whom it could iden
tify; but it has not found them
ail, for Germany still has its
sources of information ih Eng
land. Ireland, we are told, is
loyal as a whole, yet it contains
a great number of men who are
quite the reverse. The govern
ment did not .venture to extend
the mild measure of compulsion
to that island. -Even in parlia
ment there are members who
nag, carp and complain, and who
oppose everything that is pro
posed and every minister who
proposes it.
Add the losses that the coun
try suffers from the submarines
and mines, the destruction and
devastation wrought by the Zep
pelinraids, the heavy taxes, and
the rising cost of the necessaries
of life, and we can in a measure
understand the troubles that the
English are facing. Yet they
are cheerful and confident. No
more than the Hermans have
they any thought of giving up.
Give them time enough and they
will cure some of the evils from
which they suffer. Like good
sportsmen, they will endure the
rest with a smiling face.

penury for the greater
ing coincidences of - literary rtis
tory that Shakespeare and Cer
vantes died on the same day,
says the Youth's Companion.
Certainly no other date has
brought so great a loss to letters
as April 23. 1616; for the great
Spaniard, like the great Eng
lishman, soon burst the bonds of
nationality and race, and for
nearly three hundred years has
been a part of the literary herit
age of the " hole world.
Oddly enough, we know little
about Shakespeare and much
about the author of "Don
Quixote.'' What is really known
not merely guessed or sur
misedabout Shakespeare could
be told amply on this page, but
what is known of Cervantes
would fill a portly lume of ad
venture and romance. A lab
orer, a soldier, a sailor, a captive
to pirates, and a slave to the
Moors in Algiers; never giving
up his hope of rescue or his at
tempts at escape; spared from
execution by a master not in
sensible to intrepedity; ransomed
by the sacrifices that his parents
and his friends made for him
he saw the stream of life both at
ebb and at flow, and traveled
both with the current and
against it. No wonder that he
drew from its waters such wealth
of experience, such knowledge oi
human nature!
"Don Quixote" is probably the
most human piece of imaginative
literature in the world. No
other work of Ii.moi. combines
in the same degree keen and
gentle satir ., spai k! rg comedy,

Cotton Acreage
The latest reports as to the
acreage planted in cotton this
year show an increase of ap
proximately twenty per cent,
which of course is due to the
high prices which recently pre
vailed. While the acreage in
cotton will be materially in
creased in this county this year
it will not be permitted to inter
fere with the grain crops, so
we may say that our farmers
have not gone wild over cotton
again. If we make a fair crop
of cotton it will certainly show a
good profit, owing to the fact
that it will be made at a very
low cost to the producer. Wood

Cowpeas
The ridiculously low price at
which cowpeas are now selling
throughout the country affords
an opportunity for the farmers
to plant large acreages in these
legumes at very low cost for
seed. By doing this the farmers
not only get the best variety of
hay but are enabled to build up
their lands at the same time.
