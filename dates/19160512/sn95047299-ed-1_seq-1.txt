Orlando Reporter-Star: The Reporter-Star

that W. A. Russell, editor of the Pa
latka News, will be a candidate for
the legislature. Having known the
party for some years, and during that
time having come to esteem him
highly and to place great value upon
his ability as a public man and worth
as a citizen, we know that the people
of Putnam county will do well to hon
or Mr. Russell again by sending him
to the legislature, as tney nave done
twice before. We should like to have
tho nnnnrtunitv to work and vote for
Editor Russell. He thinks clearly, he
speaks foreetuiiy ana ne acts lear
lessly. He is attentative to duty, con
siderate of his fellow member's rights
and feelings, and enjoys the confi
dence of the state's leading men and
best people.
San Mateo Gives Picnic.
San Mateo people gave a big bas

of the school house.
People from all the surrounding
country came and brought baskets
and at noon thece were opened up.
The food was sprea'd on a great .a
blo under the oaks, and the people
fell to with a relish.
After dinner addresses were made
by several of the candidates and
when this was over there was a ball
game and then dancing in the school
house. It was a very happy affair,
and is a credit to the good people of
this beautiful town. Many went over
from Palatka, and quite a number
were present from Crescent City, and
some from remote west county pre
cincts. Rev. L. E. McRae, and Mrs.
McRae were present from Harlem,
and Mr. McRae, who formerly preach
ed there, was called on for the invo
cation befwe the dinner.

DRESSES VOTERS
At Court House Defends
Vote on Child Labor
Congressman Joe Sears of Kissim
mee, now serving his first term in
Congress and fighting the tight of hia
young and heretofore calm life for a
second term, spoke to an audience of
perhaps 75 to a hundred men at the
Putnam county court house on Wed
nesday evening.
Congressman Sears has perhaps
been criticized more extensively and
more bitterly than any of the other
Florida members for his vote in op
position to the Keating-Owen Child
Labor Bill, and he devoted the great
er part of his speech in defense of
that vote. He opposed the bill, he
said for the following reasons:
First, because 1 do not believe it i3
constitutional;
Second, because I believe it is a
matter which should bo regulated sole
ly by each State;
Third, because no provision is made
in said bill to take care of orphan
children, who are unable to provide for
themselves; and
Fourth, because Florida already has
in my opinion a much better law than
the Keating-Owens Bill.
Congressman Sears said that since
he made hi3 speech in congress in
opposition to this bill, it had been a
source of great pleasure to him to
note that Miss Mary S. Garrett, foun
der of the home for the training of
deaf children before they are of school
age, member of the Pennsylvania
Court and Probation Association, and
of the Philadelphia Juvenile Court and
Probation Association, has practically
endorsed the stand I took in toto. I
quote from her testimony before the
Senate Committee, as follows:
"There is, however, a danger not
well understood by the average citi
zen, growing out of the strict enforce
ment of this law. In Illinois no child
undir the age of fourteen years can
ever legally be employed at any fain
ful occupation and children between
the ages of fourteen and sixteen years
cannot be employed during the months
when school is in session, unless a cer
tificate is obtained from the school
authorities permitting such employ
ment. One of the results of the rath
er strict enforcement of this law has
been to turn hundreds and thousands
of bright young boys upon the streets,
especially during the summer months
when school is not in session. They
meet in groups in alleys, play marbles,
craps and engage in other games of
doubtful character. Here the good
boy meets the vicious boy and togeth
er they plan some escapade which usu
ally results disasterously to both."
Mr. Sears also quoted a number of
other workers in behalf of children in
opposition to the bill. He made a
most excellent impression. Mr. Sears
is an effective speaker and at times
reaches to periods of genuine elo
quence.
Dr. Fogerty Here.
Dr. J. N. Fogerty of Key West, per
haps the biggest man intellectually
and forcefully in the Congressional
race in the Fourth Florida district,
spent a part of the day Wednesday in
the city. Dr. Fogerty is the present
State Senator from Monroe and Lee
counties, and during the last session
of the Florida legislature he did not
fail to leave his impress on the work
of that body. He was .generally re
garded as the most influential man,
the safest advisor in that body.
Dr.Fogerty saw a number of our
citizens on his visit, and has promised
to return and make an address before
the end of the campaign. All who
met this genial gentleman were great
ly impressed with him, and there is
no doubt that he will secure a large
vote from this city.
The Florahome Kickers.
Editor Palatka News:
No doubt you have heard of "kick
ers" everywhere, but Florahome has
the best bunch of kickers that you
ever met. They began kicking about
three weeks ago and last Friday night,
May 5th, succeeding in kicking up the
best entertainment ever pulled off in
Florahome.
When the north bound train rolled
in from Palatka, there was kicked off
f fhn finest looking candidates
that offered for office. Then this
bunch was kicked up to Palmetto
Hall, where they kicked up the best
free supper that was ever given to a
bunch of candidates. Then the Flo
rahome candidates was kicked clear
out of the ring by a sudden attack of
indigestion, but that didn't stop the
kicking. They kicked up Mr. Wal
cot, who introduced in a very fitting
and eloquent manner 25 of the candi
dates to an audience of over 200 peo- I
pie who had been kicki up m cc
and hear the candidates. Ice cream
and cake were sold at a reasonable
price, and $65 was kicked up for the
Methodist church; and all you can
hear on the streets is congratulations
and regrets that they forgot to thank
the candidates and audience for their
attendance, patronage and sociability.
There was no graft, and nothing but
(rood feeling, and Florahome will ever
feel proud and thankful for the occa-
1 :t if nrara nnssihle the people
of the place would elect every candi
date who was present. i
home candidate is sorry that he was
kicked out, and that his opponents
were not kicked in. They were kick-

we kick in future, let us kick like this
it hurts no one. REVELS.
PUTNAM DEMOCRATS
10 HOLD BARBECUE
And Make a Great Political
Festival in Palatka
On Occasion of the Visit of State and
Senitorial Candidates, May 29th.
The Democracy of Putnam county
is going to give the Gubernatorial and
Senatorial candidates and other State
candidates a rousing reception in Pa
latka on Monday, the 29th inst., and on
which occasion all the people of the
county are invited to come to this
city and enjoy a good old-fashioned
barbecue, and hear the distinguished
speakers. Only the State and Sena
torial candidates will speak. It will
be the final wind-up, in so fir as Put
nam county is concerned of a long and
tedious campaign tedious alike to the
people and the candidates.
The barbecue is to be held on the
Burt lot, on the river front where
there is plenty of shade and seats will
be provided. Experienced men will
bo engaged to barbecue the meat and
if you have never known the joys of
barbecued meat you have one pleas
ure in store that will abide with you
during your remaining days on earth.
Time was when our grandfathers had
these affairs frequently during polit
ical campaigns. That was in the davs
whon the newspapers were not so nu
merous, it was their method cf get
ting together and hearing discussed
the political questions of the day
and eating and drinking and making
merry. It was called by the politL
cians the hustings.
Bear this great meeting in mind.
Come, and got a genuine Palatka wel
come.
The ladies of the Baptist church
have arranged to have an ice cream
and cold drinks stand at the barbecue.
The committee of arrangements will
meet to-night to further the plans of
the barbecue.
THE "'GROUP" SYSTEM
II CLEVER SCHEME
To Rob Voters of Freedom
of Choice How it Works
in Putnam.
Mr. Russell Makes Statement.
At a public meeting in Florahome
on Friday night, May 5th, and again
in his speech at the Crescent City
picnic on Saturday, May bth, Mr. W.
G. Tilghman made certain statements
which were so manifestly unfair and
so certainly untrue that I feel that I
must correct them. If after reading
this statement, Mr. Tilghman contin
ues to repeat them, I have no doubt
but that the unprejudiced, fairminded
people of the county will know where
to place the author of the slander, and
will proceed to do it.
In the speeches made by Mr. Tilgh
man at these places he stated that I
was "the candidate of the Catholics of
the county," the implication being that
I had been, brought out by them to
defeat him.
In answer to this statement of Mr.
Tilghman's I desire to say:
First, that no Catholic, individual
or organization representing that
church, ever said one word to me with
reference to my becoming a candidate
for the legislature. I was influenced
to become such candidate by several
gentlemen of Palatka and Putnam
county, all of whom, it so happens,
are prominent workers in Protestant
churches and one of whom is a well
known Protestant clergyman.
Second, that since becoming a candi
date I have been approached by no
individual Catholic, or any organiza
tion representing that church, or any
of its lay or clerical societies, for the
purpose of learning how I stood on
any question whatsoever; that I have
made no pledge to any man or set of
men, the carrying out of which as a
member of the Legislature, would re
quire a violation of my solemn oath
"to support and defend the Constitu
tion of the United States and the State
of Florida, so help me God."
I am a candidate for the Legisla
ture as a Democrat, and only as a
Democrat, a party whose fundamental
principles are broad enough to admit
to its ranks all who believe in a "gov
ernment of, by and for the people,"
and which stands for "equal rights
for all and SPECIAL PRIVILEGES
TO NONE." In event of my election
I shall be free to fulfill my solemn
obligation as a legislator of the State
of Florida, and I do not believe there
is a man in Putnam county who
knows me, no matter what else he
may think of me, who believes that
W. A. Russell would PERJURE him
self in office or out of it.
A wiser and better-known man than
myself has said:
"No candidate who attempts to cap
italize the prejudices of the people
should be elected. It doesn't matter
what direction the prejudice may
take. If it is prejudice and a CANDI
DATE PLAYS UPON AND MAGNI
FIES it for the PURPOSE OF TURN
ING VOTES away from some certain
other candidate, and turning votes to
HIMSELF, he may be written down
as UNWORTHY OF CONFIDENCE
AND SUPPORT. We might put it
even stronger, and say that a person
who RESORTS TO SUCH TACTICS
TO GAIN VOTES IS NOT IN THE
STRICTEST SENSE HONEST."

Snails at a Delicacy.
The French merchants of Paris first
tasted snails when visiting the vine
yards of Burgundy for wine. ' They
brought the first baskets of them to
Paris by coach from Auxerre. By 1850
the advent of the railroad had brought
the Industry to quite a development,
and markets were opened up In France,
Italy and Spain for snails.
The last legislature enacted one vi
cious and most undemocratic amend
ment to the primary law. It is the
"group" system of nominating candi
dates for the legislature.
In effect this "group" law says:
"Where there are two to be nominated
for the same office, and there are
more candidates than are required to
fill the offices, they shall run in
groups."
Under the old law, if there were
three or four, or more, candidates for
Representative in the Legislature,
their names appeared on. the ticket in
alphabetical order and the voter wa3
instructed to vote for any two of his
choice.
The "Group" system differs. Here
is the way it will work in Putnam
county:
At present there are three candi
dates for Representative, viz. Henry
S. McKenzie, W. G. Tilghman and W.
A. Russell. Two are to be elected,
Mr. Tilghman and Mr. Russell have
qualified to run m Group 1. Mr. Mc
Kenzie in Group 2.
Unless some one comes out against
Mr. McKenzie by the lbth inst., he
will be certified as the nominee with-
out going on the ticket, as the law
provides.
Under the old system the names
of the candidates would have appear
ed thus:
For Representatives Vote for Two.
HENRY S. McKENZIE
W. A. RUSSELL
W. G. TILGHMAN
Under the new law the ticket will
read:
For Representative Group 1, Vote
for One
W. A. RUSSELL
W. G. TILGHMAN
For Representative Group 2 Vote
for One
HENRY S. McKENZIE.
In case, however, as stated above,
if no one comes out against Mr. Mc
Kenzie, that gentleman wiU not be
required to go before the people. He
is the nominee under law.
In group one the evil of the sys
tem is seen in the fact a number of
people in the county may have made
up their minds to vote tor both
Messrs. Russell and Tilghman. Un
der this group system they are not
allowed to do so, as under the old
system would have been their privi
lege. They can only vote for one.
If any one comes out against Mr.
McKenzie, the. case 'would be the
same; they could vote for but one,
even though they might prefer both
the candidates in group 2.
The system ROUS THE VOTER
OF HIS FREEDOM OF CHOICE. It
is therefore a VICIOUS, UNDEMO
CRATIC system.
For the past six weeks Messrs. Mc
Kenzie and Russell have sought to
secure Mr. Tilghman's consent to a
discarding of this "group" system in
the coming primary.
Lesral advice was obtained to the
effect that if "all three candiates by
MUTUAL AGREEMENT arranged to
run in the old manner, there would be
no one to contest the matter and
therefore the ones receiving the
highest votes would be given the nomination."
A great many counties of the state
have declined to accept the group
system and their candidates are run
ning in the old way. Why not fut-
nam?
Simply because Mr. Tilghman will
not consent.
In the presence of several gentle
men some two weeks ago, Mr. Tilgh
man, when making his final decision
not to enter this agreement with
Messrs. McKenzie and Russell, said:
"No, it may be a bad law, and I
e-uess it is. but I helped to make it
and I feel that I must follow it."
One of the gentlemen who was
standing by remarked: "But, Mr.
Tilghman, the law is unfair; it is
unjust to the voter; many of them
will not be able to understand it;
some may vote for two men in one
group, in which case their vote would
be thrown out."
Mr. Tilghman replied: "If you will
let me have a moment I will explain
the law to you "
"Oh, I understand it all right," re
plied the gentleman, "but many will
not, especially the careless voter. The
law was not made for the voter's
benefit, and if you understood it Mr.
Tilghman, why did you vote for it?"
"Well, it's the law," again replied
Mr. Tilghman, and I can't help it
now, and I am going to follow it."
Later at least two of these gentle
men roundly condemned Mr. Tilgh
man for voting for the law, and es
pecially for his unreasonable attitude.
Messrs. McKenzie and Russell
waited several days longer, hoping
Mr. Tilghman,, in the interest of the
voters, might recede from his posi
tion and consent to a free-for-all race.
Finally they were obliged to give it
up and will therefore follow the
group system.
When the time for final decision
came, Mr. McKenzie sent Mr. Rus
sell the following note:
"Dear Mr. Russell:
"Inasmuch as Mr. Tilghman has
steadfastly refused to go into the
'gentleman's agreement,' relative to
making the legislative race without
going into the Group arrangement, I
have decided to enter Group z, as
T
The advertisement announcing that
the Palatka News together with
some merchants and business firms
were going to give away one hundred
and two volumes and four sections
of book cases created much comment
among the members of many church
es, lodges, schools and societies.
Very many inquired how they could
best organize a campaign, for pro
curing votes. Our advice to them
and others is this: "concentrate your
forces." First cut out the -free cou
pon appearing in the Palatka News
each week; second see that your par
ents and friends patronize the mer
chants and business firms listed on
the contest advertisement.
The library and case are now on
display at the Fearnside Clothing Co.,
and we invite the best critic to pass
judgment on the class of books cho
sen by the contest managers for- Pa
latka. The one reason for display
ing the books from the first day of
the contest to the last is that we
know it will inspire confidence in any
and all contestants who enter the
race.
Watch this paper for results of all
votes polled by contestants. The
standing of all organizations will bo
published every week during the con
test. Who will win ? What's the an
swer? None can tell, so let us all
wait and watch developments. Wo
are going to witness a campaign for
votes on this contest which will sur
prise the most skeptical. The lowest
in the column still have a chance in
the next twelve weeks.
BE A BOOSTER. If not a sub
scriber to the Palatka News, get on
the list now. Also get acquainted
with the merchants and business
firms who have made it possible for
some, church, lodge school or other or
ganization to own and be the proud
pssessor of this fine collection of one
hundred and two volumes and four
sections of book cases. Patronize
these merchants, that is all they ask.
They will give you the votes free.

Grandin People to Picnic.
The good people of Grandin will
give an all day picnic in the grove
near Grandin station, next Wednes
day, May 17th. It will be a basket
picnic, and the tables will be set out
under the trees.
Invitations have been- sent to the
people in all the surrounding country
and the prospects are that it will be
an immense gathering of old-time
character and that neighbors and
friends will meet and enjoy a day's
visit who have not seen each other in
some time. The people of Grandin
know how to entertain, and they aro
preparing to use their full knowledge
on this occasion.
Various county candidates will be
present, and if possible one or more
of the Congressional candidates. All
who wish will be allowed time to
make short addresses. Don't forget
the place and date. AND DON'T
MISS IT.
originally selected, and will forward
my papers to Tallahassee according
ly. I regret that our original propo
sition for a free-for-all race, which
you and I have tried so consistently
to have, has been made impossible by
the refusal of the third party to so
enter. I expect to be out of town for
a couple days, hence I am dropping
you this line.. Yours very truly,
HENRY S. McKENZIE."
This is a truthful story of the final
refusal of Mr. Tilghman to enter the
usual free-for-all race, and is told
without any attempt to enlarge or
magnify the attitude of Mr. Tilgh
man. It is the story of how Put
nam county democrats are now to be
compelled to vote under the group
system for Representatives in the leg
islature, a system that has robbed
them of that freedom of choice in the
selection of candidates that is their
due.
These voters will be able to see that
it is a most UNDEMOCRATIC SYS
TEM, and one the responsibility for
which rests alone, in so far as the
County of Putnam is concerned, up
on the shoulders of Mr. Tilghman,
who was the only representative from
this county to vote for it.
There were present and taking part
in the conversation above related, as
well as listeners, such representative
men and citizens as Dr. Geo. E.
Welch, president of the Putnam Na
tional Bank; Mr. R. C. Middleton,
business man and capitalist of Cres
cent City; Mr. H. A. Perry, a grova
owner and well-known citizen of Po
mona, and Hon. A. V. Long, States
Attorney, and others, either or all of
whom we believe will vouch for the
absolute truthfulness of the state
ments above made.
