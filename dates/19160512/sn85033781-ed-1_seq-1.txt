all and abovp ail honesty is the one
sterling necessity to the achievement of
success.
Wednesday, May 10, 1016, was th
:tOth anniversary of the birth of tin
Paw Paw Savings bink.
Oq May 16, 1886, the Paw Pa a s u
inga bank opened its doors for business
with tbe following directors: Jonathan
J. Woodman, Frank W. Sellick, John
W. Free, William J. Sellick, John Lyle,
William Lle, Daniel Lyle and Kdjjar A.
Crane.
The (first oflic rs of the btnk on
Kiank W. Sellick, president; Ej4gar A.
Crane, vice president; John VV. Free,
cashier.
Our esteemed and venerable feitOW
citizen, Oran W. Rowland, whh tbe first j U ia ony simple justice here to add
depositor, and it might be interesting to . th(lt jhn w fr9 HC.ive heag of the
add that he has been a continuous pat- . lm(jk ioo6 9 or,aoiiltio0 possesses

While the experiences of this bulking j has given the business his undivided
house h'we not varied materially from j pcrtOOal attention, tias for many years
many another similar enterprise, stiil U j oeun its president, atl t him more
is interesting to know that from its very I than all else is due the enviable standing
inception it has eo joyed a large business j the bank no m 81 joys. Every day Mr.
There Is No "Just As Good" As
G. & B. PEARL Wire Cloth
The wonderful durability of G. & B;
PEARL Wire Cloth as well as its beauty is
due to its metallic coating. The composition of and
method of applying this coating is exclusive with us
and used only on genuine PEARL. So when a
dealer offers you something 4just as good as PEARL'
he is mistaken. It isn't so. There can be no 'just as good.'
and eacn succeeding year nas snown a
marked increase, until today the Ia
Paw Snviugs bank is known as one of
the solid substantial and progressive
banking institutions of southwestern
Michigan.
Thc-re is also a pathetic side to this
little story of the bank's history, found
in the fact that out of the original direc
tors all have passed to their reward but
two, John W. Free and VVm. J. Sellick
The personnel of the founders was of
the highest ordpr. They were men of
Free iuhv be found at his desk, waiting
on customers nnd directing tbe bank's
nlTairs with his old-time courtesy.
Surely the years have dealt kindly with
him 1 1 i.-i judgment, business ability
and long acti ve business life have made
his efficiency of the highast order and
he M rich in the confidence and esteem
of his fellow citizens.
The present officers of the bank are:
John W. Free, president; Wra. K. Sel
lick, vice president; C. A. Wolfs, cashier;
Blaine Warner, teller.

The day you screen wi th G. & B. PEARL
you enff trouble and expense. No painting no re
pairing PEARL lasts and satisfies. It is the hand
somest screen and the cleanest as well as offering least obstruc
tion to the vision.
Look for two copper wires in the selvage and
the Round Tag bearing the Gilbert 6c Bennett name on
each roll. They identify the fenuinc article, and for the sake
of screen satisfaction they are worth looking for and insisting on.
