Future of New Musical Or

E NT URGE
Entire Program Was Ren
dered in Highly Satisfac
tory Manner.
The Fairmont Choral society, at J
Its initial appearance in the city last
I night, made a tremendous hit, and in,
i the opinion of the audience, establlsh
i ed not only its right to existence but
its right to the support of the public
| In general. The audience which Illled
| the First M. E. church was a splendid
one, it overflowed the entire main au
| ditorium and balcony and oxtendcl
] o the Sunday school room which was
i thrown open as the crowd increased,
i It was made up of representative cltft
i zens of the city and the concensus of
opinion as expressed in enthusiastic
] terms throughout the evening and at
the close of the program, was that the
| society is an institution and encour
| agemont of the community.
| There was much elation among the
I promoters of the Choral society over
i the sucosb, they having felt that on
tho success or failure of the first con
cert, hinged the future of the society.
I Under the efficient direction of
Louis Black, dean of the West Vir
ginia university school of Music, a pro
gram of a miscellaneous nature, in
cluding Russian and old English songs,
i was spendidly rendered by a chorus of
1100 voices, which included the beBt
i singers of the city and much undevel
| oped talent. Among the numbers was
Gounod's "Gallia" with Mrs. Myrtle
Shaw Waddell as sollsts. It was one
of the heavlst numbers of the program
and was splendidly rendered. Other
special numbers were the women'*
chorus, "The Snow," with vlolia ac
i companiment, Miss Olive Wajioaugh
i and Miss Mary DJUe./gf Morgantowp,
rendering the viojta mu?lc. It was
\ most effectively rendered. Miss
Bertha Dllgard rendered the solo in
the selection "The Sands of Deo," and
Miss Virginia Mulvey. W.?D .Barring-,;
ton and L. H. Randall, sang the trio i
parts of "The Heavens Are Telling,"
from Hadyu's "Creation."
Probably the crowning feature of
' the program was the sextet from
1 "Lucia,' rendered by MIsbgb Edna Jac-1
obB, Mrs. Oliver Wood, Lamar Satter-1
field, W. D. Barrington, Jack Abbott
and L. H. Randall. The voices of the
singers were splendidly adapted to tho ,
selection and It brought forth such!
persistent applause that it was re-1
peated.
Adding wonderfully to tho success
of the concern was the plondid piano
accompaniment rendered by Miss
Hazel Bock, of Farraington. Miss
Bock is thoroughly at home with the
piano and her work last night was ex*
ccllent winning most favorable com
ment. Assisting on two numbers, the
"Gallia," and the selection from "The
Creation,' was Mrs. Xucile Gregg
Welch at the pipe organ whose work
there was equally successful. The
violin obligato by Misses Dllle and
Wambaugh was also one of the fea
tures of the evening.
The Fairmont Choral society was or
ganized in January and cousidortng
Its extrome youth has already won un:
unusual laurels. The concert last night
will close work until the fall season,
when rehearsal on a second enter
tainment will be begun some time In
October. It is planned to bring an
artist of national reputation to the
city on that occasion.
The society haB a list of about 100
active members and a list of 67 hon
orary members. The object of the
society is the promotion of good mu
sic in the city and the development
of talent. It fully merits the support
which tho public so willingly gave it.
The piano used for the concert was
loaned to the society by the Davis
Burkman & Tyler Co.

ROAD TO CAROLINE
10 BE ELECTRIFIED
Traction Company Will Run
1 Cars to New Mining
Town.
With orders to go to work immedi
ately a force of Monougahela Valley
Tractbn wire men will start electrify
ing the six miles of railroad from
Worthington to Caroline. This-road
Is owned by the Western Maryland but
will be placeU at the disposal of the M.
V. T. company which will runs Its cars
tor the convenience ot the workmen
employed In that section. Later, per
haps after the work of slriiiRin? wires
and placing of poles Is completed on
the Caroline branch the traction com
pany will go to work bonding roll and
preparing the Wyatt branch of nine
miles of track for the trolley cars.
The traction line will run cars to
these terminals every two hours during
the daytimo and will also run each day
an express car which will handle all
express for these points. Freight ship
ments less than car loads will be hand
led by the traction line. Full ?loads
of freight will bo taken care of by the
WeBtem Maryland engines.
Thero will be several schedules sub
mitted to the operating department of
the traction line but It Is most likely
that n car will leave Fairmont and run
to Caroline, returning to FalVmont.
The next car, which leaves Fairmont
two hours later to run to Caroline,
thence to Wyatt returning from there
to Fairmont.
No stations will be placed along the
road as far as is known now, that
matter having to wait until certain sec
tions develop sufficiently to warrant
a car stopping for passengers. 1,
The electrification will be completed
about September or October on the
Caroline road and will be commenced
on the Wyatt branch as soon as that
road is completed.
MAN NOMINATIONS

Cash Prizes for All Who
' v.i v.WftM'-l i
The opening of the West Virginian
"7,000 Club" 1?uCh^nTEcartl 1 y wel
comed by the public, both, in Fairmont
anil in;the outlying districts which are
to be included in the campaign.
Although the West ..Virginian has
conducted previous.contests and dis
tributed large.amounts in prizes, nev
er before has there been such a valu
able aggregation of awards offered,
nor such- an interesting plan of distri
bution, and the largo number of nom
inations received by .the Manager of
the .7,000 'Club both Wednesday and
Thursday proves that these facts are
appreciated by the public..
This is the first campaign ever in-]
augurated. in Fiarmont or vicinity j
where there has been such, generous
awards for everyone. No matter how j
many enter the club, there will be a
cash prize for every member who fails j
to win the Overland Six-cylinder Car;
or one of the other splendid prizes. I
The plan of campaign is worthy ot
special consideration. It is a high
grade business proposition. There is
nothing of the bluster of tho ordinary
contest connected with it in any way
It is an opportunity such as comes
but once in a life-time, where you have1
every chance to win big stakes, and
where you have absolutely no chance}
to lose.
Men of influence, farmers, profes-j
sional men, young ladies from theJ
best families cannot fall to profit by
entering the "7,000 Club."- it coBt tV
become an active member absolutely
nothing?not a single penny. A little
of your sparo time and one of the,
valuable awards is yours.
The Districts.
Tho teritory included in tho cam
paign has been divided so that every
one has an equal opportunity to cany!
off tho highest honors of the cam-1
paign. Outside of tho grand capital;
prizes, candidates are competing for i
the prizes with none except the other
candidates in their own district In
this respect there are two separate
contest running: at once; and closing
the same day. Separate awards have
been provided in each district thus
making it so much, easier for anyone
interested to win anyone of tho prizes
they desire.

GERMANS STILL
HAMMERING AT
DEAD MAN HILL
Two Infantry Attacks Last
Night Stopped by the
French.
WHY THEY WANT VERDUN
French Senator Points Out
Importance of Briey
Valley.
PARIS. May 12.?Two attempts by
the Germans last night to recapture
positions on the western slope of Dead
Man hill taken by the Frjench on May
10 were frustrated by the French ar
tillery fire. Artillery is active about
the Avccourt woods and the bombard'
ment in the Douaumont-Vaux section
continues, according to the official wai?
office report issued today.
Senator Berenger writing in today's
Matin says that the koy to the war
lies in the possession of the Briey
valley between Verdun and Metz.
"Since the war began" says Senator
Berenger," France having loat the
Briey basin has been obliged to import
almost all the iron required from ling
land and America while Germany, hav
ing occupied the whole Briey valley,
is able to add. 21,000,000 tons to hor own
annual output. This explains the as*
siduity ot the Germans at Verdun. They
want to capture the fortress so as to
effectually prevent the French from
attacking Metz.
In a confidential memorandum ad
dressed' to Chancellor Von Bethmann
Holtyeg on conditions of future peace
by the Germany industrial agricultu
ral association on May 20 1915, the
following passage occurred: "If the
production of iron and steel had not
doubled since August, 1Q14. the contin
uation of the war would have been im
possible. The Briey region now pro
duces 60 to 80 percent of our iron and
steel and if that production was hamp
ered the war would be particularly
