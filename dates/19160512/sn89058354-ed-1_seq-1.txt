" Mr. Drane only recently made
his announcement.
For delegates from the state-at-large
to the Democratic
national convention it is predict
that Senator Luke Lea, Con

Thomas R. Preston and W. H.

he will not be a candidate ' for
the position. -
There are very few contests
from counties to be settled by
the convention. The exception
being Shelby, where a few form
er office-holders named a delega
tion to contest with the regular
Democratic delegation. H o w
ever, as the contesting delegation
does not even claim regularity
and Js merely backed by C. P. J.
Mooney, editor of the Commercial-Appeal,
G. T. Fitzhugh,
former Republican caucus nomi
nee for the United States Senate,
and a, few other disgruntled
politicians, it is really considered
a ioke - and there seems little
chance that th credentials com

" "hearing. -
Quite a number of Henry

attend the convention. A special
round-trip rate of $3.85 has been
made by the N. C. & St. L. rail
way for the occasion. The Hen

leave Tuesday.

PLANT OF A-GO MANUFACTURING COMPANY
The Parisian this week closed
a deal with the A-Go Manufact
uring Company, of this city,
whereby this office will handle a
$4,000 job printing contract
the. largest contract of its kind
ever made by a Paris business
firm.
This contract was awarded
to The Parisian because the job
printing department of this office
is equipped for handling all kinds
of printing. The management
of the A-Go Manufacturing Co
desired the very best that was to
be had and as they realized the
fact that The Parisian was equip
ped to execute high-class work
that The Parisian only executes
high-class work they knew
exactly where to place the con
tract in order to get the desired
results.
While this contract is the larg
est ever handled in Paris, The
Parisian will do the work at
home no part of it will be sent
to out of town concerns and al
though such a large contract
will require a great amount of
work and considerable time, The
Parisian III at all times be in a
position to handle all other print
ing desired by its customers. A
$4,000 printing contract will not
tie up our type and machinery,
since this office has been equip
ped for the purpose and with the
intention of handling all kinds of
printing, in large or small
amounts, and doing the work
satisfactorily and prompty.

pany.'s large plant, a picture of

short while. The closing of this
gigantic printing contract at
tests to the confidence the man
agement of the company has in
the future of the business.
The drinks, cereals, etc., to be
put up by the A-Go Manufactur
ing Company guarantee the suc
cess of the company's plans.
All products of the company will
be excellent, and even the very
names given them will make
them "A-Go", when the quality
behind them is taken into con
sideration. The A-Go Manufacturing Com
pany will manufacture Beale's
Peach Brandy, Beale's Raspberry
Brandy, Beale's Mint Julep,
and Beale's Grape Punch, all
delicious, refreshing, non-intoxicating
drinks, as well as Beale's
Hearts 0' Wheat, Beale's Coffee
and Cereal, Beale's Pan-Cake
Flour, Beale's Raisin Butter,
Beale's Peanut Butter and other
cereals.
While the advertising contract
made with The Parisian is a
large one the largest ever made
by a Paris firm it is expected
that even this amount of print
ing will be supplemented shortly
after the company's products
are placed upon the market and
the public becomes acquainted
with the merit they possess.
The A-Go Manufacturing Com
pany will mean another industry
for Paris; the employment of a
number of people; more business
for the city's merchants and a
bigger place on the map for the
city.

EMPLOYES WELCOME EXTRA
WORK DAf FOR EACH WEEK
Prosperity Here To Stay Is
Prediction of Many.
Plenty of Cash
After working only five days
in the week for nearly eighteen
months, the Louisville & Nash
vilie railroad shops here last
week resumed the six day
schedule.
About three months ago the
shops commenced working nine
hours daily, after working eight
hours for more than a year, and
now that the six day week has
been resumed, the employes are
very jubilant.
While officials have not stated
that the six day week will con
tinue, it is understood that it is
planned to work six days through
out May and it is generally be
lieved that this schedule will
hold indefinitely.
The putting on of an addition
day each week is considered by
business men to mean that pros
perity and good times are here
to stay and that business con
ditions are and will remain
normal.
The additional day each week
for the shop employes will mean
more money in their pockets,
more money spent with local
merchants and more money in
local banks.

PROSECUTION'S EVIDENCE
CAUSES DISCHARGE OF MEN
Girl In Age of Consent Case
Admits She Has Been
Immoral for Years
When the State's evidence had
been heard in the case against
Rome Oakley, charged with vio
lating the age of consent, Mon
day, Justice W. T. Snow dismiss
ed the charge against Oakley and
the other defendants, Horace
Witherspoon, Sam Farmer, and
Curtis Oakley. In the afternoon
the Josh and Mack Lee cases were
heard and these defendants also
discharged.
The main witness introduced
by the State was the girl in the
case, Lona May Dunn, who al
though claiming that she was but
16 years of age admitted on the
stand that she had led an im
mortal life for three years. She
told her story without a blush of
shame snd declared that she had
not considered her acts "wrong."
She said that she knew Rome
Oakley's desires when she went
buggy riding with him on the
morning he was charged with hav
ing carnal knowledge of her;
that she went with him willingly;
had taken but one drink of whis
ky and made no resistance to his
advances.
She said that if Oakley collect
ed any money from the others
against whom she had brought
charges she did not know it; that
she saw no money passed, and
received none herself.
After hearing the girl's testi
mony there was nothing for Jus
tice Snow to do except dismiss
the charge, as the law states very
plainly that there shall be 'no
conviction on charges of violating
the age of consent upon the un
supported evidence of the female
in the case or when the female
is a lewd woman.
The circuit court room was
packed during the hearing, and
and nearly every lawyer in Paris
was connected with one side or
the other of the case.
Rome Oakley sumitted the case
of giving liquor to a minor and
was bound over under a $250.
bond on that charge.
On Tuesday the Dunn girl was
