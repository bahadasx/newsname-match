to tlo coursso ho la to pursue and
-when instructions did cono a confer
oncc, which had been proposed for
tho morning .was postponed.
Falling to havo a doflnlto date of
withdrawal set,, it was reported that
tho Mexican government may try to
iavo part of tho American troops
taken out at onco, leaving tho re
mainder to co-oporato with tho forces
of tho do facto government in tho
.pursuit of Villa groups.
Tho report, which could not bo
confirmed, had It that tho Mexicans
beliovo tho aizo of Porshlngs army
is out of all proportion to its mission
tho extermination of a few hun
dred bandits and that a much
smaller forco would answer tho pur
pose. A partial withdrawal, It is
argued, would havo a good political
lnflenco In Mexico.
In tho absenco of new proposals,
tho situation as it now stands I3a3.
follows:
Generals Scott and Funston 'arc
opposed to any agreement which sets
a date for tho American withdrawal
from Mexico.
However, the American conferees
Tiro listening to all proposals tho
Mexican' Minister of War may mako,
whllo' waiting for him to realize that
tho intentions of tho American gov
ernment aro Immovable. '
In tho meantime, Gonoral Obrc
gon's proposal for a Joint troop pa
trol of the border Is not given seri
ous consideration although It was re
ported to Washington.
Tho American conferees doubt If
the do facto government can muster,
fl.ifflelnnt forco to form a natroFof
tho sort outlined and at tho same)
tlmo carry on its campaign against
tho Zanata and - Villa forces.
At tho conference' General-Scotf
Requested General Obrcgon to put In
writing his view of action that has
been taken In the dilemma.
Whllo tho situation is still regard
ed ' as serious, ono circumstance
points to an easing of th'o?tonslon
that is evident. Although General
Funston is urgently needed at Fo-t
Sam Houston, San Antonio, to direct
tho mobilization and disposition of
tho additional troops ordered to tho
border, General Scott advised that ho
remain hero "to take part In confer
ence. It was pointed out that the.
American chief of staff would hardly
keep his fellow-.confereo away from
his headquarters if tho situation Im
peratively demanded any Important
military preparations.
In tho meantime, howover, tho
Amerlcnn" military chiefs aro under
stood to havo taken additional stops
to guard against eventualities. Gen
eral Porshing is said to havo received
order Bto materially lessen his lln
of communication and to, draw in all
scattered detachments. Cajonla Dub
'lan is reported to bo tho objoctlvo of
tho northward retiring columns.
It has been suggested In some
quarters that the delay in tho pres
ent negotiations it not a bad thing
elnco It will permit completion of tno
now army and militia movements
before nnv break If ono comes oc"
