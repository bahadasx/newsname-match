Negotiations Between Obregca

Kl Paso, May 12. After negotia
tions between General Hugh Scott
and Alvaro Obregon bad been brok
en off, the latter ordered General
Trevlno to send 10,000 troops into
the region opposite Big Bend, Texas,
and parallel, it .waa learned today.
It was believed that the purpose Is
to prove that the de facto govern
ment la able to control the bandit sit

to Mexico City.
El Paso, May 12. The Mexican
situation reverted to Washington to
day, following the failure of negotia
tions between General Hugh Scott
and General Alvaro Obregon.
Provisional President Carranza's
veto of the tentative agreement gov
erning the occupation of Mexican
territory by American troopa and
steadfast demand for a time limit on
the stay( of the American expedition
split the conference. ....,
Scott was powerless to accept the
time limit proposition and, falling to
find a satisfactory compromise, the
conferees passed the Job along to the
diplomatic forces.
Carranza's diplomats are reported
en route to Washington, with Instruc
tions to negotiate on the formal re
quest for an American 'withdrawal.
Action on this request has been de
ferred In the hope that the confer-

administration today cast upon the
Mexican de facto government the bur-

the presence of United States troops
In Mexico.
The cabinet threshed out the situ
ation at length. No reply to General
Carranza's withdrawal request is ex
pected until Ambassador Designate
Arredondo asks for it. Then the
United States will answer that the
expedition will not withdraw until
the border la considered safe from
further bandit Incursions.
It was learned officially today that
the administration Is none too con'
fldent that, new terms can be ar-
ranged through the diplomats of the
United States and Mexico.
General Alvaro Obregon told Gen
eral Hugh Scott that' he could not
write any agreement placing the de
facto government In the light of con
senting to the American expedition's
stay In Mexico. Officials hope that
the expedition may continue Its work
unmolested by uncontrolled Carrania
bands.
After thecablnet session, one mem
ber said:
"It looks as thoijgh It were their
next move."
. Tt was announced that no change
In the Mexican policy was contem
plated and that no new troop move
ments had been ordered, and that the
situation so far as American action
was concerned was, the same as be
fore the border conferences. Anti

Senate Cocuziitee Again Takes
Up Investigation Into Qual
ifications of Wilson Nom
inee lor the Justice Bench
Washington, May 12. Testifying
before the senate sub-committee In-
vestlgating the qualifications of
Loufs D.- Brandels as Justice of the
United States supreme court, Louis
Liggett of Boston, declared today
that he employed Brandels to say
whether the proposed merger of the
United Cigar Stores and the Kikker
Hegeman Drag stores was legal be
cause Brandels was known to "lean
backward" In favoring the enforce
ment of anti-trust laws.
"We thought that If we could get
by him we could get by anyone."
said Liggett's attorney, F. E. Snow,
Brandels, they asserted, told them
that the proposed merger was lawful.
The forces opposing the confirmation
of Brandels' nomination sought to
show through Liggett and Snow
jthat Brandels was out of sympathy
with the anti-trust act and that be
approves combines which the govern
ment believes Illegal. ' "' '
Federal District Attorney George
Anderson testified that he thought
the merger Illegal, but said this was
merely an honest difference of op
inion. Llgget said that the department
J of Justice was still suspicious that
the merger might harm competitors
if it wished to do so and that It was
a violation of the trust law, although
no suit had been filed.
The merger waa completed.
Washington, May 12. A situation
more serious than at any time since
the American expedition entered
Mexico confronted the administration
today as a result of failure of the
conference between General Hugh
Scott and General Alvaro Obregon.
Secretary of War Baker directed
Scott to return to Washington and
Funston to return to San Antonio at
his own discretion.
The administration's next step Is
conjectural. It ia feared that Mexi
cans will get the idea that refusal to
withdraw means an intention to do
other than merely break up bandit
bands. '
The authorities believe there is no
'way of diverting Oarransa from his
Insistence on a withdrawal, though
they hope he will be passive In that
demand. Failure of the conference
does not make continuance of the ex
pedition's operations Impossible. It
Is hoped that Mexico will take the
situation calmly, as It has done In
the past. . .
Secretary of War Baker's an
nouncement with regard to. the bor
der conferences said that both sides
earnestly sought an agreement, but
that Inasmuch as they faded, they
left the matter to the diplomats de
partments of the United States and
Mexico. It was understood that Gen
eral Obregon feared the political
prestige of himself and Carranza
would suffer If border conferences
were continued.
As the American - border patrol
stands at present, army men regard
it as sufficient. No orders for fur
ther 'mllltl movements are contem
plated, it was said, unless border con
dltlons become more menacing, ,

THE IflSSI or

San Francisco, May 12. All hope
that, as time passed, the extent of
the North Pacific liner Roanoke dis
aster might be lessened, was prac
tically abandoned today when boats
which patrolled the scene of the
wreck hunting (or survivors returned
with reports that they had sees no
indication even of floating wreckage.
It is evident that the only survi
vors of the wreck are Quartermaster
Elb and two Mexican firemen, who
drifted ashore In a life boat with
five corpses. The United States des
troyers Hall and Truxton are search
ing the waters which suddenly swal
lowed np the historic old coasting
steamer looking for bodies of the 50
souls that went to death with the
ship.
Fifty men are keeping watch
along the San Luis Obispo coast, ex
pecting that bodies may wash ashore.
Quartermaster Elb's description of
the disaster, supplemented by the
stories of the Mexicans, Is all the
government will have to go on in its
Investigation of the wreck- Elb de
clares that the vessel began tilting
at 2": 20 p. m. Tuesday and that Cap
tain Richard Dickson clung to the
sloping bridge directing the lowering
of life boats from one side of the
liner. Those on the other side were
useless on account of the sharp HbL
Some of the life boats were dropped
from the davits stern first and their
occupants hurled into the water to
drown. Elb believes the ' captain
went down with his ship when It
turned turtle.
Several theories for the wreck have
been advanced. A suggestion that
the Roanoke struck a submerged der
elict or unchartered reef, or that a
time bomb placed among the tons
of dynamite in its hold exploded and
ripped a hole under the water line
Is not taken seriously. It Is gener
ally believed that the disaster was
caused by the cargo shifting while
the Roanoke rolled in a heavy sea.
The three survivors will be brought
to San Francisco as soon as they are
able to be moved and will be request
ed to testify at the government probe.

TELLING ON HUGHES
New York, May 12. Supporters
of Colonel Roosevelt saw expediency
In EUhu Root's Red Cross speech in

Among other political items glean
ed today was the fact that John
Stewart, who is fathering the Gen
eral Leonard Wood movement, an
nounced he would soon Issue a state
ment of the republican party's state
of mind on Wood.
The Hughes' boom, which has been
without headquarters because he
frowns on the use of his name, was
received with rumors that Hughes is
now more conciliatory since he re
ceived letters from all parts of the
nation, urging him to beoome a presi

The Roosevelt advertisement In a

was an appeal In a new direction,
since it is a bid for peace advocates'
votes, lauding Roosevelt as a peacemaker.

Disaster That CcstHalfalfcn

Probed on Theory. That It
Was Work cf Pktters
San Luis Obispo, Cal., May 12.
Attorney C. H, Sooey, of the North
Pacific line, arrived here today to
investigate a theory that the steamer
Roanoke disaster waa caused by a
time bomb being placed In the dyna
mite cargo when It was transferred
from the ships which brought It from
Puget sound to the Roanoke in port
here. Sooey wonld not divulge the
grounds upon which be based this
suspicion, bnt he declared he Intend
ed to interrogate the three survivors
carefully concerning It .
The survivors. Quartermaster Elb
and two Mexican firemen, are ap
parently recovering from the effects
of their terrible experience. Elb to
day added a number of details to
,hls account of the wreck, chief among
them being a graphic description of
how Carlos Belgrano, Oakland high
, school boy, who had shipped as
freight clerk, came to his end.
I Elb said that Belgrano was la the
.lifeboat with htoJ.whett it w cap
's! zed. Both were plunged into the
jSea and grasped planks. Together
they attempted to keep afloat and
, reach another boat. Elb said that
j Belgrano got a slippery board and
.lost. his hold on it repeatedly, always,
, however, swimming for a moment
and then again grabbing his support
Finally, however, when another
lifeboat was approching through the
heavy sea, the Oakland hoy was over
- whelmed by a big wave and his
frantic grip on the plank was torn
loose for the last time. Belgrano '
, swam desperately for a moment, try
ing to keep his head above water un
til the lifeboat came up, but he dis
appeared under another wave while
rescuers were extending their hands
to him. Elb never saw him again,
i Watchers along the beach, np to
noon, had been unable to discover
any traces of survivors or bodies of
victims. The patrol Is being main
tained, however, in the belief that
corpses will drift ashore. , '
