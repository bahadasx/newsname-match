good plant is worth a whole garden of
failures.

J! II. GRAFF IS
CANDIDATE FOR
COUNTY CLERK
On another page of this issue will be
found J. 11. Graff's announcement of
his candidacy for the office of County
Clerk on the Republican ticket at the
August primary.
While Mr. Graff is a resident of South
Arm township he has been too long
affiliated wjth East Jordan and its
interests to need any introduction.
About a year ago he resigned as City
Commissioner owing to his change of
residence. He hs served East Jordan
and South Arm Township ably as
City Commissioner and Supervisor and
will poll a good sized vote in this sec
tion where his ability is known.
If nominated and elected, the voters
of Charlevoix County will be placing a
new man in county office who is thor
oughly conversant with county affairs,
and whose ability is unquestioned.
Politically, Mr. Graff has been a life
long Republican and has at all times
worked faithfully., for Republican
interests.
WORK OF THE COUNTY
AGRICULTURAL AGENT
OBJECT The object of the work of
the County Agricultural Agent as offici
ally stated by the Michigan Agricultural
College and the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture is to give instruc
tion and demonstrations in agriculture
in order to secure the adoption of bet
ter farm practice, organization, and
administration, to the end of increasing
the profits of farming and improving
rural social life.
METHOD OF PROCEDURE Men
well trained in science and the practice
of agriculture and known as County
Agricultural Agents, are employed and
located permanently, one in each
county or like area of the State (with
or without assistants,) as rapidly as cir
cumstances warrant and funds permit.
These agents co-ordinate and apply the
results of several departments of the
Michigan Agricultural College, the
United States Department of Agricul
ture, and other research institutions,
with such studies of farm practice and
farm organization as may be made by
the agent in the course of his work, to
the end of carrying concretely to the
farmers of the county or community,
on their own farms, a knowledge of
sound principles and successful prac
tices in agriculture. They also aid in
the reorganization and redirection of
the agriculture of the community, and
in the correlation of all economic and
social forces with the agencies work
ing for the improvement of agriculture
and county life, in so far as may be
possible and desirable; and bring into
existence when needed, and co-operate
.i ; u i
wun, agricultural ciuus, assuciauuus,
and other organizations whose objects
are the improvement of agricultural
practices, marketing methods, and edu
cational, home, and social conditions
throughout the country. Farmers and
members of their families are met indi
vidually and in groups for the purpose
of study, instruction, and demonstra
tion in field, barn, creamery, school
and elsewhere.

During the last fifty years the American home has undergone
little less than a revolution. Science and invention have wrought
marvelous changes in our economic and industrial conditions.
Some of these changes have a tendency to destroy the unity of
home interests. Time and distance have been annihilated. Home
permanence has in a large measure been destroyed. The responsi
bilities of the mother have been increased. She finds it impos
sible to keep her flock together; she finds her task of inspiring
1 and directing her children more and more difficult. She must,
therefore, do her greatest work when her children are 'little tots
when they are most responsive to the tenderest and wisest sugges
tions. American mothers recognize this necessity, and are mak
ing holy sacrifices to this end.
The mothers of every country are more important than armies
and munitions of war. The mothers are the source of civilization.
To our mothers we owe our patriotism, our religion, our holiest .
aspirations. It is especially fitting in the year nineteen sixteen
that we pay tribute to the Mothers of America. Let the boys and
girls and the "grown-ups", who are away from home on Mothers'
Day, write a letter of gratitude to Mother. "Let those who are
home meet Mother with a smile, a kigs and a handful of flowers.
Recite to her the prayer she taught you at the bedside."
Therefore, I, Woodbridga N. Ferris, ask that the people of
Michigan set apart the second Sunday in May (the 14th) as
Mothers Day. In obedience to a Resolution by the United States
Congress, I ask the people of Michigan to display on this day the
United States flag on all government and public buildings, at their
homes or other suitable places, "as a public expression of their
love and reverence for the Mothers of our country.'' As far as
possible let parents in their homes and both young and old in
public meetings discuss the theme of Mother with that enthusiasm
and sincerity which characterizes all loyal Americans.
Given under my hand and the Great Seal of the State, this
third day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine
hundred and sixteen, and of the Commonwealth the eightieth.
WOODBRIDGE N. FERRIS, Governor.

MAY YOUTH'S MONTH
By "Observer."
May is the month that makes men of
boys.
1 heir kites, marbjes, balls and tops
lead them into health-giying exercises
that are not quite so enjoyable when
the hot rays of the sun later on suggests
less strenuous sports swimming, fish
ing, etc.
The boy, or shall we say kid, who
has not learned to make his own kites,
his own sling-shot, and his own fishing
tackle, the boy who doesn't know what
it is to suffer a nailless toe, isn't living
just right. But the chances are his fail
ings are not his fault. The probabilities
are that such a boy is retarded by too
much paternal guardianship.
Turn the boy loose this spring not,
of course, wholly without supervision,
but let him get all of the benefits of
early spring by spending every minute
possible out of doors. The chances are
his days full of play will make him glad
enough to stay at home evenings, and
when a real boy is willing to stay at
home of evenings his parents haven't
much cause for worry over him.

ALONG THE FIRING LINE
"Tradition is a handsome thing in
proportion as we live up to it," said
President Wilson to the members of
the D. A. R. Convention. Then he
broke a date to meet the ladies of the
convention and went to the ball game.
Tradition continues to b4 a handsome
thing.
Our "shortened line of Communica
tions" in Mexico will follow closely the
line of the Kansas, Mexico & Orient
Railroad. The practical mind will at
once want to know why we do not use
the railr6ad itself. The answer is that
Carranza will not let us. Yet Wilson
made Carranza.
We have yielded to Germany, we
have yielded to England, and now it is
made known in Washington that we
are about to yield to Japan in the mat
ter of some of the restrictions in the
pending immigration bill. Yielding has
become a real habit with the Wilson
administration and presently it will
yield to a Republican administration.
It is announced that Ambassador
Morgenthau has resigned in order to
promote a "non-partisan league" to aid
in Wilson's campaign. The illuminat
ing information is further vouchsafed
that Mr. Morgenthau consulted with
Mr. McAdoo about the league before
the Secretary sailed for South America.
Under the auspices of McAdoo and
Morgenthau, who can doubt the real
"non-partisanship" of any league which
they will promote?
Indiana Republicans should offer
their thanks to Senator Tom Taggart.
who has decided to be a candidate for
election to the seat which he now holds
by the appointment of the Governor.
This will afford a line-up in Hoosier-
dom which cannot fail to benefit the
Republicans, for Taggart, while a suc
cessful political boss, lacks much of
being able to command the indepen
dent vote which is so large a factor in
Indiana political affairs. Moreover, it
clarifies the issue for Indiana to deter
mine. The Ralston administration,
which Taggart has thoroughly controll
ed, has been most unsatisfactory to
the tax-payers and with Taggart on the
ticket there is a most excellent oppor
tunity to get after the "man higher up."
Champ Clark berated the House
soundly the other day for its dilatory
tactics. A week or so before he was
taking up a cudgel in defence of that
body because of public criticism of its
delay. Mr. Speaker, where are we at?
Japan imported nearly a billion
pounds of raw cotton in 1915, compared
with 827,000,000 pounds the year before
This cotton was worked up into cloth
and a considerable portion of it came
into this country, because of the 40 per
cent cut in the tariff on cotton wearing
apparel, enacted by the Democrats.
Japan is also driving us out of the Chi
nese market on cotton goqds. The rea
son is very plain. Japanese laborers"
work 11 hours a day in the textile mills.
Female spinners receive 16 cents a
day; weavers 14 cents. Male weavers
receive 22 cents. Dyers get 26 cents.
We may expect competition with Japan
to increase so long as the Democratic
tariff law is on the statute books.
The Department of Commerce an
nounces a competitive examination to
be held for "assistant to expert in
commerce and finance." Whoever
the "expert" himself may be, he is cer
tainly in need of considerable assist
ance, judging from the way the statis
tics issued by the Department are gar
bled. The Department of Commerce re
ports 30 foreign-built vessels admitted
to American registry since June 30,
1915. These 30 vessels will get from
under the Stars and Stripes just as soon
as the war is over, if the seamen's law
is then in force.
The "non-partisanship" which the
White House cries for in order to get
its schemes through Congress is finely
demonstrated in the Democratic threat
to apply the gag to the House of Re
presentatives as a means of accelerat
ing the passage of the Philippines bill,
the shipping bill, and other measures
which are entirely personal in their
origin and political in their purpose.
Never argue with a man who is over
70 years of age, or with a woman of any
age.
