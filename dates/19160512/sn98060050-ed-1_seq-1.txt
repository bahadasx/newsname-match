People all over New England rejoice in
the settlement of the big sliovelers' stiike
in Kpiingficld, Mass. Its continuance
might have imperiled the success of the
Eastern States exposition and National
Dairy show to he held in the fall in the
city 00 miles south of us.
lhc state department of weights
and measures is considering this nd
vocacy of a law to sell eggs by tho
pound. Wo have no doubt that cvent
nlly this custom will prevail nil over
tlio country. There is no fairness in
selling eggs by tho dozen method
which lias always lieen in vogue. Kites
vary so much in size that one dozen
may weigh ."0 per cent less than an
other dozen, llig eggs arc worth more
than little ones, and ought to be sold
according to their worth.
The farm help problem which, like the
poor, we havo with us always is accent
uated in these booming industrial times,
when active men icadily secure employ
ment at wages above the normal rate.
The big factories manufacturing munitions
and other products which are biinging
great profits under war prices are luring
away from the countryside many of the
young men who know the farming life
and are well fitted to follow it. One of
these days the war will end, the boom will
break in some directions, and the men
who have deserted the farms may find that
their situation far from enviable. The
young man who looks ahead in his plan of
life, and who decides to make real farm
ing a life work and a life study is pretty
likely to be as well off financially and to
know more of comfort and contentedncss
in middle age than his brother who is at
tracted by the suddenly high prices of the
present in industrial establishments.
It is an encouraging sign to seo the
Vermont farmers so deeply interested
in the raising of vnluable purebred
cattle. Thousands of dollars changed
hands this week in Rutland at the first
sale of tho Vermont Breeder's Sales
company. The consignment were from
well-known herds in this state, and the
tock will go to farms over a largo
area where it will torm the nucleus tor
new herds. A single bull from the Io-
befl consignment in Wells was bought
for $1,000 by Cramton Brothers of Irn
and O. A. Thomas of the town of Rut
land, and K. C. Johnson of Vergennes
paid $"00 for a seven-year-old cow
with nearly a 30-pound record. Among
the Windham county purchasers were
A. F. Allen of South Londonderry,
hoifer, $25(1; G. J. Dorsett, South
Londonderry, cow, $2.10; Mrs. Mary Al
Ion, South Londonderry, cow, $22.');

MRS. BROWN AWARDED $105.
Marlboro Woman Sued Husband's
Father for Pay for Services $15,
000 Suit Against Last Block Co.
The jury that heard the case of Eva
L. Brown of Marlboro against her fa-thcr-in-law,
Albert O. Brown of that
town, lor pay at tlio rate of $2.00 a
weelc for services rendered him for a
period of between nino and 10 years,
returned a verdict Monday after
noon for $101.70 after being out about
an hour.
Shu testified that sho had an agree
ment witli her father-in-law by which
sho was to help with the housework in
his part of the double house in which
alio lived with her husband, Ernest
Brown, and that her father-in-law was
to pay her a reasonable amount for her
work, 'ihis, sho said, hod never been
paid her and sho considered that $2.oU
week for such timo as sho worked
for him, was reasonable pay. A di
vorco Hiiit sho has brought is on tho
caiendar for this term of court.
The plaintiff 's witnesses were Rev.
II. II. Shaw, E. P. Adams and Green
Worden. The defendant's witnesses
wero his son, Ernest Brown, husband
of the plaintiff, Hugh Luce, Charles
Worden, Walter Thayer and alter
Snow. The parties also testified. All the
witnesses wero from -Marlboro.
lUtorney F. E. Barber made the
opening and closing arguments for tho
planuill and Attorneys K. W. Gibson
and W. R. Daley argued for the de
fendant. The ease now in hearinir is that of
Affra II. Ryder of Brattleboro against
tlio Vermont Last Block Co., also of
Brattleboro. lie seeks to recover $li.
000 for injuries received while in the
employ of the company Feb. 4, 11)14.
The lilaiiitiu claims that ho was pass
ing a conveyor which was in defective
condition and that a heavy block of
wood le.l oil ami hit him on the head,
causing injuries from which he has
never f till v recovered.
lie was under tho caro for some timo
of Dr. E. It. Lynch and later went to
Springfield, where he was operated up
on by Dr. Walter Weiser. A part ot
his skull was removed and an abscess
found on the inner plate of tho skull
which pressed against his brain.
The abscess was removed ami the
part of tho skull which had been re
moved was replaced and wired into po
sition with silver. Before tho opera
tion tho plaintiff had suffered severe
pains and frequent bleeding at the
nose, and while ho was relieved in a
measure by tlio operation ho had not
been able to do any work since the
ccidcnt.
Dr. E. R. Lynch and Dr. Byron E.
White, who attended Ryder when ho
was liiiurert in 11)14, testitieu as to tlio
extent of the injuries.
Mrs. Ryder told of her husband be
iliir brouirht homo injured and of his
attempting to work after tho accident
belore going to the hospital in hpring
field, Mass., for an operation. She told
of breaking up housekeeping and sell
ing tho furniture becauso ot tlio linan-
cial condition of tho family and of
their five children. Two of them are
married and the other threo aro aged
14, 12 and 8 respectively.
The defenso was begun Wednesday
afternoon.
The defense set up that the convey
or, which was alleged to bo defective
by tlio plaintiff, was in perfect condi
tion. C. L. Wyman, who was foreman
of the plant at 'the time of the accident,
and B. F. Palmer, the present foreman
and at the time ol the accident an em
ploye, both testified that there was
nothing wrong wnn me maciiuie iroui
which a heavy block of wood is alleged
bv the plaintiff to have fallen and hit
. t i i ; i.:...
hlhl oil Ilie ucau, uauiy injuring mm.
Mr. Wviimn further testified that af
ter tho 'accident he helped take tho:
plaintiff to the office and dress his
injury and that while there the plaintiff
told him that it was the planum s own
fault because he passed too near tho
spout and was hit by the block of
wood when it came out.
Palmer, too, helped dress the wound
ed man and afterwards went to tlio
conveyor and inspected it and found
nothing defective. The bookkeeper of
the company testified that lie telephoned
for tho physician and that some days
later, when Ryder camo back to work,
Ryder told him tho accident was his
own fault for he got too near tho spout.
F. 1L Sanford, manager of the Last
Block Co.'s plant nnd an official of tlio
company, was on the stand brielly Wed
nesday afternoon to testify as to the
company, its olllcers and employes.
Sumo of the arguments were made
yesterday. The others will be made
this morning and the jury probably will
get the case this forenoon. Attorneys
F. E. Barber and Harrie B. Chase aro
counsel for Ryder, and the defendant
is represented by Glcason & Wilcox of
Montpelier.
The 15,000 tons of dyes that Geimany
has consented to allow shipped to this
country will grant a teniporaiy lelief of
the dye famine here, but the real relief
should be n protective tariff that will en
ablo Americans to undertake the manufac
ture of dyes for themselves. The Demo
crats refused to attach any such amend
ment to the resolution continuing the
duties on sugar, but we believe the coun
tiy will demand this protective measure so
strongly that ultimately it will be granted.
The Law Is Enforced.

WILSON DAY POLICE
New
Traffic Posts Necessitate
Services of Officer
Posts Placed in Position Yesterday
Town and Village Act Together for
Benefit of Traffic and Public.
Two traffic posts wcro placed yester
day by the village commissioners
and the selectmen of the town acting to
gether, at the intersection of Main and
Elliot streets, and at the inteisectiou
of Main and High streets. The object
is, of course, to safeguard traffic ' at
those points and better provide for the
safety of the public.
The village officials and Police Chief
George Wilson spent Wednesday even
ing in Greenfield and studied the traffic
regulations there.
Appieri.iting the necessity of having
someone to enforce traffic rules, arrange
ments have been made by the officials
whereby Chief Wilson went on duty at
12 o'clock, noon. Ho will go on duty "each
noon and work until about midnight.
Officer Ellis LI. Woidcn will go on duty
early in the evening and wotk through tlio
night. The time of heaviest traffic is in
the afternoon and evening anil with the
traffic posts and the officer on duty in the
afternoon it is hoped that pcdestiiuns will
have an easier time crossing .Main street
than has been the case in the past.
The piopcr location of the post at tho
comer of Main and Elliot streets is one
that will be determined by practical use
and it may be found advisable to change
it several times before the piopcr location
is finally detei mined.
It is the purpose of the officials of the
village and town not to put into force any
unreasonable regulations, but only those
which will serve as a protection alike to
drivers and pedestrians. The officials ask
the co-opeiation of all driveis to tlio end
that the traffic problom may be simpli
fied. It is probable that the commissioners
and selectmen at an early date will pre
pare some reasonable traffic regulations
and submit them to a special village meet
ing for approval. In wotking out these
legulations the officials will lie glad of
suggestions and co-opciation on the pait
of owneis of vehicles.

Lusitanin. was sunk. Tlin Inurr-nwnltnil
German note was received in Washing
ton late i rinay. Although unsatislnc
tory on several points it met the Pres
ident's basic demand with Germany
"immediately declare and effect an
abandonment of present methods of
submarine warfare." The note stated
that Germany s submarine commanders
have been ordered to conduct their
warfare against merchantmen in ac
cordance with the general principles of
visit and search recognized bv inter
national law and that theso orders aro
now in effect. Germany, by implica
tion, threatened to withdraw tho orders
unless the United States obtained con
cessions from Great Britain relative to
the blockade.
The replv to Germany was cabled bv
Secretary Lansing Monday. In it tho
United States accepted tlio declaration
of abandonment of the former subma
rine policy and stated that this country
relies upon a scrupulous execution of
tho altered policy to remove the prin
cipal danger of the interruption of tho
good relations existing between the two
countries. With the acceptanco was
coupled a formal notice that tho United
States cannot tor a moment entertain,
much less discuss, a suggestion that re
spect of German naval authorities for
the rights of citizens of tho United
States on tho high seas should, in tho
slightest degree, be mado contingent
upon the conduct of any other govern
ment affecting the rights nf neutrals
or non-combatants. This last statement
is i'i reply to the request that the
United States use its efforts to break
tho British blockade.
Tho American note, according to ad
vices from Berlin, is entirely nccepr
ablo to the Gorman foreign office and
and is fnvoiably commented upon by
the leading newspapers in" Berlin and
other cities.
In another note, received in Wash
ington Wednesday, the German govern
ment admits that tho steamship Sus
sex, on which American lives were lost,
was sunk by a submarine. Germain
states that the submarine commander
responsible has been punished, and
promises that reparation will be made.
