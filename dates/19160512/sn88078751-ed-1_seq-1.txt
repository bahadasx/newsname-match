To Americans
Stepsv Taken To Checkmate Hostile
Move Of Carranza
El Paso, Tex.,. May 11. With tho
army backing up to the border In
Mexico, all Americans ordered to
leave the country and 10,000 new
troops coming to reinforce those in
Mexico or on the border, there Is con
siderable speculation over what thr.
outcome will ho. Many wero inclined
to look upon the matter In the light
that the United States had reached a
definite decision not to come out ot
Mexico with its forces until it la good
and ready and that these are hut pre
liminary steps to meet and checkmate
any move tho do facto government or
that country may attempt.
Consul T. D. Edwards, American
consul in Juarez, received a messago
from the state department at Wash
ington to order all Americans lu his
district to leave Mexico at once. Ha
gave the information to the newspa
pers and correspondents as official.
It came simultaneously with knowl
edge of tli3 fact that General Pershing
has been told to fall back towards the,
border with his forces now In Mexico
hi order to shorten up his line of
communication and put him closer to
the American border and the rein
forcement of regulars and militia
called out.
First steps towards apparent with
drawal were taken by the United
States when General Pershing was In
structed io withdraw his troops to
Celonla Dublan, 120 miles south of
the border, and establish his base
there pending the final settlement of
the discussion between General Scott
and General Obregon as to how long
the troops shall remain In Mexico.
This will mean the mobilization of
tho entire expeditionary force at Co
Vmia Dublan, except for a compara
tively small force guarding tho short
ened line of communications and the
cctposts stationed near Dublan. Tho
Mormon town is believed to have
been selected as the base because
there are comparatively few Mexi
cans living there and because of lis
nearness to the railroad.
No time has heen announced for
tho withdrawal of the American
troops from the advanced hase, but it
1 expected that troop movements will
begin soon and tho advanced cavalry
scouts will be called In from tho coun
try to tho south and west of San An
tonio toward Namlqulpa, and tho
withdrawal will then be made slowly
toward Colonia Dublan.
ORDERED TO FALL BACK
American Forces to Retire On Colonia

Washington, May 11. While Major

era Mexico was not explained.

FIVE MEN ARE IN CUSTODY
Charged by Samuel Clark With As
sault and Battery Bond Instantly
Produced by Quintet and
They are Released
What In all probability will be the
last arrests, at least for tho present,
In the Jackson township tar and
feather case were made Wednesday
afternoon by Sheriff John M. Wool!
son and Deputy Sheriff Walter B.
Mossholder when Tour residents of
tho southeastern portion of the coun
ty and one man residing in Coshocton
county were taken in tow by the offi
cers. Those who were taken Into custody
are the following: John Spang of Co
shocton county, Melvln and Roy
Toothman, Joseph and Melvln Jones,
all of Knox county. All the arrests
were made on warrants sworn out
on affidavits made by Samuel Clark,
Jackson township farmer, who was
tarred and feathered by seven mask
ed men on Saturday night, April 29.
Within a few days after he had
been subjected to the tar and feather
treatment, Clark caused the arrest on
Thursday, May 4, of Edward Boyd
and Earl Rino on charges of assault
and battery. These men waived ex
amination and were placed under ?500
bonds to await the action- of the grand '
jury.
It was stated at the time that other
arrests would probably be forthcom
ing In the case, depending on the de
velopment of evidence and Clark's de
sires in the matter.
Armed with warrants for the arrest
of five more alleged participants in
the case, the sheriff and his deputy
made the trip Wednesday afternoon
to Jackson township precincts and se
cured their men. They were brought
to this city immediately and arraign
ed before Mayor Charles A. Mitchell
at 5 o'clock on charges of assault and
battery. All waived examination and
wero bound over to common pleas
court to await the action of the grand
jury. Bonds of J500 were given and
tho men were released.
The bonds for the Toothman broth
ers were signed by their father, those
of the Jones brothers by their uncle,
R. L. Jones, while Spang's bondsman,
Dugan by name, resides in Coshocton
county.
Sheriff Woolison stated Thursday
morning that all of the five evidently
expected arrest, as each had made
full arrangements in regard to bond
so that there was not the slightest
hitch at the arraignment.
All of the men vigorously denied
any implication in the tarring and
feathering of Clark and averred their
total Innocence.
With the two former arrests, Wed
nesday's round-up brings the total
number of arrests up to seven the
number said to be in tho party the
night of Clark's terrifying experience.
