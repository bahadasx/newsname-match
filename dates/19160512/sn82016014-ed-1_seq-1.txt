William A. Gardner was born in
Gardner, 111., in March, 1859. He
learned telegraphy and began his rail
way career as an operator on the Chi
cago & Alton at Lemont, 111., in 1872.
He entered the service of the Chicago

ities until -1885 when he was made
assistant superintendent of the Wis
consin division. Later he was made
superintendent, then assistant general
superintendent. From 1896 until 18&0
he was general manager. In 1899
until 1906 he waa vice president. In
1906 he was made president. He was
president also of the C. St. P., M. &

Mr. Gardner about thirty-five years
ago was train dispatcher for the Santa

when he held this place, to walk over
every mile of track in his jurisdiction

Mr. Gardner was promoted by the
Northwestern to the office of general

vice president. A few years ago he
was chosen president of that great

WOLVES IN TOWN
Weather 31 an, However, Pre
vented Game This Afternoon.
Jackson Refuses to Play
Doubleheader Sunday.
The weather man consulted ; tb
Three Fates and they told: him that
the most humiliating defeat they had
ever received would be administered
to Jimmy Jackson and his Wolves If
they played the Savages this after
noon. So the weather man had com
passion upon them and induced Jupi
ter Pluvius to make the heavens weep,
causing; the postponement of the first
Topeka meeting of the two teams and
bringing disappointment to hundreds
of local fans. , ' t
The Wolves came in from St. Josepn
at 11:36 o'clock this morning, and de
spite the poor showing they have been
making Jackson and Roaring Bill
Rappe forced out their bold faces and
handed out the "dope" with a free
hand.
"It's too bad it rained." Jimmy said.
"Now we will only have a chance to
beat you two games instead of three.
It's too bad."
He Side Steps.
However, Jackson was given his
chance a short time later when Savage
requested a doubleheader for Sunday,
but Sir James promptly refused the
proffered opportunity.
Jackson would not budge from his
stand against this, despite the efforts
of the local management, and Savage
was asked if he knew why the Wolves
were sidestepping. He said he did not,
but that it appeared to him that Jack
son had something in his throat, that
was choking him. Later Savage put
in a long distance call for President
Ebrlght of the Wichita club, asking
for the doubleheader in spite of Jack
son's objections, but at the time of ge
ing to press he had not been able to
talk to the Wichita magnate.
Jackson maintained his bombastic
optimism w hen questioned regarding
the strength or his team. "I don't
know where we will finish," he said,
"hut you can bet we will finish ahead
of Topeka. I predict that the Savages
will 'bli-w before the first of June."

Organization Selects Roosevelt
as Best Possibility.
Members of All Parties Flock
ing, to Colonel's Standard.
Oyster Bay, N. Y May 12. Theo
dore Roosevelt last night swept aside
all doubt as to his attitude toward the
presidential nomination. v He is in the
fight to the finish.
In a recent letter to Colonel Roose
velU Guy Emerson, national secretary
of the Roosevelt Nonpartisan 4eague,
saijfc.. -
"The platform that is absolutely
vital in our opinion for the safety of
the country during the four momen
tous years which lie ahead is the plat
form strongly stated in your recent
Chicago speech. We believe that you
are the only man now available who
can carry that platform into effect and
who at the same time has any chance
of being elected."
In his reply. Colonel Roosevelt once
more outlines the principles of patriot
ism 'and preparedness which he has
declared to be the dominant issues,
and says:
"Your league emphasizes its devo
tion to these principles and supports
me only as representing the principles'.
This is emphatically the proper atti
tude to take; and because this is your
attitude and..because you are working
in this spirit, I very earnestly approve
your work."
Brushes Away Doubt.
It can be said with certainty that
behind this declaration is a plain pur
pose of dissipating all rumors as to
Colonel Roosevelt's attitude toward
other candidates for the presidential
nomination at Chicago and of dispell
ing all doubt as to his position in the
fight..
He is a candidate on the platform
which he has outlined. He will remain
in the fight until the issue has been
decided.
With this declaration a vig
orous campaign is inaugurated which
will be waged with the utmost vigor
until 'the tickets have been named at
Chicago one month hence.

Sandusky, May 12. Fire which has

four-story business block and has
been communicated to another after
originating in the Carroll livery barn
which was destroyed, today threaten
ed the downtown retail business dis
trict and resulted in City Manager
Ward asking for help from the To

The conflagration started from un
known causes in the Carroll livery

swept- the flames into the old four
story Schmidt block at the southeast
corner of Market and Wayne streets
and at noon this building was doomed.
Wind Carries Brands.
The wind carried fire brands from
this burning structure diagonally
across the corner to the four story
Kuntz block which is threatened with
destruction. If this building goes the
fire may spread further west into the
very heart of the business district. A
strong gale is making difficult the
work of the firemen, several of whom
have been slightly injured. If the
Schmidt and Kuntz blocks are both
razed the loss will reach $300,000.

Torpedoed Without Warning,
Says Berlin Report.
Austrian Passenger Vessel
Down in Adriatic Sea.
Berlin. Mav 12. By Wireless to
Sayville. "The Austro-Hunjrarian
passenger steamer Dubrovnik has
been torpedoed and sunk by an enemy
submarine in the Adriatic." says an
Overseas News agency announcement
today.
"The Dubrovnik was not armed and
was torpedied without any waminsr
whatever."
An official dispatch from Home yes
terday announced that an Austrian
transport was sunk in the lower Ad
riatic by a French submarine. This is
the only torpedoing that. has been
"mentioned from Rome for several
days. It is possible that the vessel tor
pedoed and declared by the Austrians
to be a passenger liner, is the same ship
which the Italian government says was
carrying supplies.
The Dubrovnik was a steel screw
steamer, displacing 4,235 tons, 380 feet
long, with a 49 foot beam. She was

AMADOR SEES SETTLEMENT
He Will Conduct Next Diplo-

American Forces Withdraw
North to Namiquipa.
El Paso. Tex., May 12. Juan X.
Amador, sub-secretary of foreign af
fairs of the de facto government, who
participated in the conference with
General Obregon, called on General
Scott today and reiterated to him as
surances that such troop dispositions
as were necessary to restore and main
tain order along the northern frontier
already had been ordered.
General Obregon, who will remain
for a few days at Chihuahua, has di
rected General Trevino to send Into
the states of Chihuahua and Coahuila
10,000 men. These forces will be
taken from Torreon, San Pedro and
other points in the southern part of
Coahuila. Immediate occupation of
the district around Parral has been
ordered and what the Mexicans regard
as an adequate force will be dispatch
ed to the Big Bend country and every
effort made to run down the bandits
and rescue J. Demer, who was cap
tured in the Glenn Springs and Bo
quillas raid. General Scott previously
had assured General Obregon and Mr.
Amador that the withdrawal of the
American troops from the district be
low Namiquipa already had begun and
Mr. Amador asserted that this dis
trict would be controlled without loss
of time by the Mexican forces.
Amador a Real Optimist.
Mr. Amador expected to leave to
night for Mexico City, where he will
have an important role as sub-secre
tary of foreign affairs In the negotia
tions that have reverted to the foreign
offices of the two governments.
To newspaper men he insisted he
had no doubt of an amicable adjust
ment at an early date. He explained
that the questions .involved in . the
protocol governing the mutual agree
ment for the crossing of troops into
one and the other countries must be
the basis of these negotiations . al
though the withdrawal of the Ameri
can troops stiplated in Carranza's note
of Am-il 12 must also be consiaerea.
Mr. Amador did not regard this, how
ever, as an insurmountable obstacle to
a successful conclusion of the diplo
matic negotiations.
"And you may be certain," said
Amador, "that the danger of a con
flict between Mexico troops and Amer
ican soldiers pending these negotia
tions does not exist."
Frars C. S. Might Start It.
Mr. Amador emphasized the word
"troops," explaining that it was quite
possible to be expected that any ir
responsible band of armed men might
attack American troops at any time
but that General Obregon, General
Trevino and other high officers of
f i rva n -ra ' o nrmv hnVA JMloh Control
over their men that a move by govern-
ment forces against the Americans
was out of the question.
General Obregon's army in Sonora
will remain there for the present, ac
cording to Mr. Amador, although he
said a request would probably be made
later for the, passage of a portion of
the troops from Sonora eastward,
either through American territory or
through the American line of com
munication. At present, he said,
neither Scott nor Obregon regarded it
wise, however, to send the Mexican
troops across the American lines.
"ffot because we fear that our
troops would cause a conflict," said
Mr. Amador, "so much as we fear that
they might be attacked by your
troops."
Baker Con(rratnlats Conferees.
At this Mr. Amador turned his head
and smiled at General Scott. Secre
tary of War Baker today sent to Gen
erals Scott and Funston congratula
tory telegrams on the manner in which
they had conducted the negotiations
with the Mexican conferees.
