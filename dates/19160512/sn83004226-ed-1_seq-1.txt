JORDAN BOY SAYS ;
HE KILLED HIS MOTHER
AUTHORITIES PUZZLED OVER
MURDER CASE OF MRS.
ROY JORDAN.
Portsmouth, O.. May .-Geore Jor

his father, Hoy Jordan, killed his moth
er with a shotgun following a quarrel
because she did not ge.t up early enough
to get breukfuHt. has confessed that he
shot his mother, police avert.
The officers had brought George, an
other, son, and Fred, the three-year-old
son, before the Probate Judge arid were
preparing to ask them some questions
when Fred, Innocently pointing a fing
er, said .."George, what did you kill my
mamma for?" " '
George hung his hend and failed to
answer. The officials were quick to fol
low the lend and asked Fred how
George killed his mother, and the child
su.ld: "George killed her with a gun."
The eight-year-old lad when asked
If the accusation miide by his huby
brother was true admitted them. He
said that he was playing with the shot
gun and did not know that it was load-
contents of the gun were discharged
Into his mother's head.
The officials now are In doubt about
the correct solution of the mystery.
Prosecuting Attorney Joseph T. Mickel
thwaite was surprised Saturday when
he loomed that the boy had confessed,
and made the following statement:
"In my opinion from the father's con
duct and the statements and from the
nature of the wounds and from the ex-
"J " " . : amin'-tiotia mid reports of the physl

Portsmouth, May 9. The county au
thorities have unearthed several Im
portant clues In the mysterious murder
case of Mrs. Pomella Jordan, whose
dead body wus found In a blood bes
meared room of her home, Flat Woods,
near Lucasville, Tuesday morning,
which they believe will materially aid
them In the solution. The several stor
ies or confessions mode by George, the
littlo 8-year-old son In which he first
claimed his mother killed herself, and
then his father had shot her and finally
that he had accldently shot her, per
plexed the officials for several days.
But since the last confession, they have
adopted a new line of procedure and
expect to uncover valuable evidence
soon.
It la generally believed by the au
thorities that George has not told the
truth, for there are several parts of his
latest story which the authorities claim
cannot be "reconciled" with the facts
disclosed at the home Tuesday morn
ing. The father, Roy Jordan, who was
bound over to the grand Jury on a
charge of murder In the first degree,
still maintains that he la Innocent but
offers no plausible solution to the mys
tery. He still holds that his wife eith
er met her death by striking her head
against the bed or that "she had a ter
rible pain" in her head, causing it to
split.
Roy, James and Fred, three of the
sons, were sent to their homes Satur
day afternoon, but George will be kept
In the county Jail pending an Investi
gation, which the officials place but lit
tle credence.
Roy Jordan, Jr., the oldest son, walk
ed to Portsmouth from his home In
Kast tint Woods, Monday, to confer
with Judge Thomas C. Beatty. probate
court, relative to placing James, aged
13, and Fred.' aged 3, his brothers in
the Scioto county Children's Home
pending the Investigation of the mur
der of his mother, Mrs. Pomelia Jor
dan. Judge Beatty granted the boy's
request and will send for the two boys
Tuesday morning.
In discussing the murder case Mon
day, Roy said he was unable to say
whether his brother, George was tell
ing the truth In his latest story. "If
pa shot her then he ought to be pun
ished and if he didn't he should be re
lented, " he said.
The stock, the garden nnd the chick
ens will be tared for by Roy during his
father's absence. Roy said he had ta
ken a Job with Jerry Walker, Flat
Woods and would work there during
the day.
Prosecuting Attorney Joseph T.
Mlcklethwalt stated Monday that he
would probably call a grand Jury Thurs
day, June 1, to investigate the murder
of Mrs. Pomella Jordan. He said that
he desired a little time before issuing
the call to Investigate the puzzling de
tails of the crime.

Mrs. Cecelia McHenry. whose criti
cal Illness was noted In the NEWS last
week, died Friday morning at her home
on Madlson-st. Her, last illness hod

"Very many beautiful flowers, some
of them of the blossoms of this section

ers offered by other friends, were ex
tremely beautiful In color and design.
The solemn exercises were opened by
the singing of "Jesus, Lover of my
Soul" after which Mr. McEIdowney off
ered a beautiful, touching and appro
priate prayer. Then "Rock of Ages'
waa sung. Rev. L. M. Copley then made
the concluding remarks. The body was
borne to Pine Hill cemetery and laid
to rest by the side of her husband.
Mr. Copley prefaced his timely and
approprite remarks by reading the fol
lowing which had been written by an
old-time friend of the deceased:
