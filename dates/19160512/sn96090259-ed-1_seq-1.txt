Rosebud for Patterson.
The Rosebud ia solidly for Patter
son for congress. For the first time
in many years the ten republican
newspapers published in that section
are unanimously supporting the same
man for nomination to a public office.
They recognize in Mr. Patterson a
combination of all the important quali
ties which make an ideal congress*
pun They know that he represent*
in the highest degree the best type
qf_ Rosebud, citizenship. They know
also that his candidacy meets with
the enthusiastic approval of the peo
ple of the Rosebud country.
They are speaking for the Rosebud,
urging its claims to the recognition
his nomination would give it. The
Rosebud casts over one-fifth and near
ly one-fourth of the total vote in the
Third congressional district. It is a
large and important section of a great
and growing state, meriting more con
sideration than it has heretofore re
ceived, both politically and commer
cially speaking.
The Rosebud offers its candidate for
Congress knowing very well his great
ability and popular strength, neither
(uality being open to question.
It asks the rest of the distriot to
|oin in making Mr. Patterson the party
tominee for congress for two reasons
—the justice of its claims and the emi
nent fitness and popular strength of
Its candidate.
Afr. Patterson's campaign is largely
tn the hands of "The Rosebud Patter
son for Congress Committee," com
posed of prominent men from all over
that territory, where factionalism lias
been forgotten and a solid party again
firmly Jstablished behind the candi
dacy of tliff Rosobud's favorite son.
And to the people of the Sonthern
Hills and those living along the Chey
enne
who are vitally interested in the
Angostura Project,
we
can
might add that
Mr. Patterson iB heart and soul for
this project, and due to bis experience
along irrigation lines while in Wash
ington he
do more
thaD
any other
man we oan send there at this time to
represent this distriot. He has prom
ised to do all in his power and this
fact alone should get him the unani
mous support of the voters in this part
of the district at the primaries.
MY LADY'S SLIPPER''
Author Brady Approves Picturization of His
New Novel
The businesslike manner in which
Cyrus Towusend Brady diotates his
popular romances and the businesslike
qualities he needs in a stenographer
are illustrated in an interview concern
ing the writing of "My Lady's Slipper,"
the latest Brady story toTse put into
production by the Vitagraph Company.
"I have dictated more than a
million words," said Dr. Brady. "In my
long career as author, preaoher, lectur
er and publicist 1 have always made
use of a private secretary who is also a
stenographer, and I have found that
about one in ten have the neoessary
qualifications to aid a writer in his
work.
I was au iu ssted spectator dur
ing the taking of some of the scenes iu
the Vitagraph production of 'My
Lady's Slipper'," continued Dr. Brady,
"and feel that Ralph W. Inoe, who is
directing the comedy, has caught its
spirit. In his instructions to the mem
bers of his olever oast that includes
Anita Stewart, Earle Williams, Julia
Swayne Gordon. Bill Shea, Harry
Northrup, George Stephens, George
O'Donnell and Joseph Kilgour, he has
insisted on their paying every atten
tion in regard to the manners and
oostumes of the Louis XVI period and
personally supervises the construction
and setting of all the soenes. When
'My Lady's Slipper' is ready for the
soreen, it. will, to my mind, be one of
the most, interesting of my stories the
Vitagraph Company will have produo
»d and Anita Stewart, as Countess
Villars, th« daiutiebt Countess who
ever lost a slipper."

"THE BIRTH OF A NATION"
Magnificent Film Shown in This City Satur
day and Sunday
All that has been written and told
about the great ti!m "The Birth of a
Nation" but half describes it. This
magnifioient photoplay was thrown on
the soreen at the Morris Grand, Satur
day afternoon, Saturday evening, Sun
day afternobn and Sunday evening and
on eaoh occasion big crowds were pre
sent. People from all the surrounding
towns and the country were here for
the show and all were more than re
paid for coming. This show requires
at least thirty people, whioh includes
an orchestra of twenty-five, for its suc
cessful production. Practically every
one here saw the show and our feeble
discription would be feeble indeed to
adequately describe the wonderful
battle soenes, the assassination of
President Lincoln, the wild rides of
the Klansmen, and other wonderful
soenes portrayed in the 12.800 f'et of
film.
The orohestra accompaniment whioh
is a part of the show is a big feature
whioh adds to the realism of the
picture. Manager Parks is to be con
gratulated on seouring this pioture for
the four performances.

GILLESPIE FOR AUDITOR
John Gillespie The Proper Man For The
Auditor's Office Vote For Him
As the republican candidate for the

in every way and deserves a big mnjor
ity from the republican veters and he
not only deserves It but he will get it.
John has been uuable to see all of the
voters personally but he has assnranoe
from every part of the county that he
will get, a handsome vote. Cast
your vote for J. H. Gillespie at-the
primary and you will make no mistake.

WHEN A FELLER OWNS A BANK BOOK
Some tlomch Philosophy That is Well to

When a feller owns a bank-book an'

the wife is gettin supper and your ap
petite's immense, as you stop to swap
a story with the neighbor o'er the
fenoe. Oh, then's the time we never
seem to mind a loafiu' spell, with the
sunset colors shinin' through the
willows by the well, it's a piotur that
no painter man oan ever hope to mock,
when a feller
OWUB
a bank-book an'
has money under look!"
"There's a feelin' that is oozy like
about the earth an' sky, when folks
are busy workin' an' are layin' some
thing by of oourse you miss the wages
when the whistle doesn't blow, an'
things aren't quite as easy when the
times are dull, you know, but your
pocket isn't empty, an' yon reap the
good you've sown, as you bit the trail
that Parmley built into the Yellow
stone an' there's musio in the tiokin'
of the little kitohen olook, when a fel
ler owns a bank-book an' has money
under look."
"It's good to hear tho laughin' of the
auto's merry crew, when the evenin'
lamps are lighted all along the avenue,
I'd like to have a oar myself an' spin
around, but say, just burnin' up the
gasoline won't keep the wolf away.
The simple song of savin' is the song
the kittle sings, an' its great to stop
an' flgger out the homely joy it brings,
an' you light a fresh, new stogie an'

A ROSEBUD' CONGRESSMAN
A Good Endorsement From Home County for
Patterson
The third oongreBsional distriot of
South Dakota comprises all the terri
tory in the state west of the Missouri
river. For years, the oountry known
as the Black Hills was by far the most
important part of this vast territory
and produced most of the wealth of
the western part of the state. Bat
this was before the opening of the
famous Rosebud oountry. Since that
time the Hills oountry has lost none of
its popularity or greatness. In faot,
the importanoe of the Hill* oountry
,,
1
VoL 31 No. 4
has steadily inoreased. But along
with its development there has been
the development of the Rosebud, until
today the Rosebud oountry is the most
productive agricultural distriot of the
state and in its wealth produoing it is
second to noue.
tor years it was thought impossible
to elect a man to oongress from this
distriot unless he was from the Hills,
but the rapid and splendid develop
ment of this oountry has dispelled that
notion and politicians from all parts of
the distriot are uuauimous in their as
sertions that the Rosebud is deserving
of having one of its citizans represent
the distriot at the national oapitol.
Gregory couuty is the second largest
oounty in the distriot and Tripp is
close third With this population and
the support that will be aooorded the
Rosebud candidate, there is no ques
tion that if the people of the Rosebud
lay aside their factional politioal dif
ferences, they can elect a congressman
from the Rosebud.
Attorney B. O. Patterson, of Dallas,
bus aunounced his oandidaoy for the
llioe on the republican ticket. There
is no need of gomg into a long dis
cussion of Mr. Patterson's qualifi
cations for that offloe. He is well
known throughout the entire Rosebud
and the whole distriot, for that matter
His ability as an attorney, his honest,
whole souled nature and his knowledge
of public affairs make him well fitted
for that position of trust, for it is a po
sition of trust, and the people may well
be assured that Mr. Patterson will not
betray them.
The Rosebud now has an opportun
ity that will not come Bgain if the
people negleot to support Mr. Patter
son. He has the support of many lead
ere from all seotions of the distriot and
we believe that the people of the Rose
bud, without regard to politioal affili
ations, will support Mr. Patterson as
no other candidate has been supported.
From the Times-Advocate, Gregory.
