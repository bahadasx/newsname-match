Dance Enjoyed by All
The Rebekah dance which was
given at the I. O. O. F. hall was
one of the most pleasant affairs
of the season and a good sized
crowd gathered, people having
come from Grangeville, Ferdi
nand and Vollmer, and tripped
the fantastic toe to the strains of
music played by the Ilo orchestra.
At midnight a delightful sup
per was served by the ladies in
the banquet room, after which
dancing followed arid continued
until the wee' hours of the morn
ing.
A neat little sum of $47.30 was
cleared which will go toward the
piano which has been installed by
that Order.

the material and will give a
medal to the writer of the best
essay in the school. The con

M. M. Belknap, Miss Fannie Mc
Grew and Geo. M. Robertson to
decide upon the merits of the
essays, and the winner will be an

school securing a medal.
Farmers Do Without Sacks
Spokane, May 6.—Three hun
dred farmers of eastern Wash
ington, Idaho and Oregon voted
tonight to handle and ship their
wheat in bulk this year instead
of in sacks, as has been the cus
tom. Discussion of the question
began early today and was not
concluded until tonight. It was
stated that sacks this year will
cost $13.25 a hundred.
Money In Hogs
Juliaetta, May 7.—(Special to
the Tribune.)— T h a t there is
money—big money—to be made
at raising hogs in connection with
general farming is clearly proven
from the experience of William
Cox, of American ridge, two
miles north of Juliaetta, who,
since January 1 to April 26 of
this year, received for his hogs
alone $6,061.78.
Mr. Cox, in addition to being
the champion hog grower of the
Potlatch district, is a grower of
purebred Aryshire cattle and
raises grain as well.
The assessor of Lewis county
predicts that there will be 200
autos owned by residents of that
county by September 1st.
LET US SMILE.
The thing that goes the furthest toward making life worth while,
That costs least and does the most, is just a pleasant smile.
The smile that bubbles from the heart that loves its fellow men
Will drive away the clouds of gloom and coax the sun again.
It's full of worth and goodness, to, with manly kindness blent,
It's worth a million dollars, and it does n't cost a cent.
There is no room for sadness when we see a cheery smile;
It always has the same good look, its never out of style;
It nerves us on to try again, when failure makes us blue;
The dimples of encouragement are good for me and you;
It pays the highest interest—for it is merely lent—
It's worth a million dollars, and it does n't cost a cent.
A smile comes very easy—you can wrinkle up with cheer
A hundred times'before you can squeeze out a salty tear;
It ripples out, moreover, in the heartstrinas that will tug,
And always leaves an echo that is very like a hug,
So smile away ; Folks understand what by a smile is meant—
It's worth a million dollars and it doesn't cost a cent.

Cottouwood to have Base Ball
That Cottonwood is to have a
base ball team this season is an
assured fact, enough subscription
having been taken up for that
purpose. It is the intention to
get together a strong and win
ning team, and those who can
play and want to try-out for a
position on the team would do
well to confer with Fred Lange.
There will be a game on the
local diamond Sunday between
Fenn and Cottonwood teams, the
game to begin at 3:00 p. m. Let
there be a big turnout and en
courage the boys.
To Build Oil Tanks.
Through the efforts of Leo L.
Quinn, representative of the Con
tinental Oil Co. and the Cotton
wood Commercial Club, the Con
tinental Oil Co. decided to put in
a station at Cottonwood. The
intention of the Company is to
put in two 20,000 gallon tanks.
The Camas Prairie Railway Co.
has leased to the Oil Company
two lots east of the stock yards.
Warning Against Alfalfa
The following clipping has been
sent us by a farmer:
If you don't want lots of troub
le, don,t sow alfalfa. Along the
middle of June, when the corn
needs cultivation the most, we
had to stop and cut the darned
alfalfa. It was in bloom, three
feet high. We had to haul in 20
loads of hay off of it.
In July the folks in town in
vited us to spend a week attend
ing the Chautauqua. I suppose
they were glad when they got
my postcard announcing that we
could not come, because we had
to cut that bloomed alfalfa patch
again. Gee, but it was hot haul
ing in that hay!
Worse still, I was fool enough
to go to work and sow five more
bushels of alfalfa seed. The only
rest I'll get hereafter from haul
ing alfalfa will be on rainy days.
It got to rain again in Septem
ber, and about the first thing I
knew that darned alfalfa was
three feet high and all in bloom;
it had to have another hair cut.
Then Bamum & Bailey's circus
came to town, and darned my
buttons if I didn't have to miss
that circus for the first time in
40 years. I got mad, and then
turned the pigs, cows and calves
into it; and still the blamed stuff
kept growing to beat the cars.
They could not keep it down—
they got fat on it.
But still this alfalfa hay that
we sweat at cuttin' and stackin'
makes mighty fine stuffin' for
the cows these cold ground hog
days. Everything on the place
eats it except the hired girl, and
she ain't been here long.—Lewis
ton Tribune.
Howard McKinley and wife
left for Spokane Tuesday.
Creamery Contract Closed.
The creamery contract is
closed and the subscribers will
meet Saturday afternoon to select
a building committee.
Construction will begin at once
and the intention is to have the
plant ready for operation about
the 1st to 10th of July.
Before the plant is ready for
operation the organization of the
company will be perfected and a
committee appointed to have
cream rates established and all
details carried out for final incor
poration.
Now that the creamery is a cer
tainty the entire community
should give it their hearty ap
proval and support. It is en
tirely an industry of community
interests and once in success
ful operation will greatly benefit
every citizen regardless of his
business or occupation.
Even the knocker should
throw his hammer away and join
in with his neighbors to boost a
home institution that will foster
and develop. The dairy industry
helps pay the grocery and store
bills and greatly assists in lifting
the mortgages and freeing the
home from debt.

tion will meet Friday, May 19th,

past several years, only one day
has been held. This was agreed
upon by a unanimous vote at a
meeting of the commercial club
of that city. It was decided to
give one day to stock exhibition
as a number of farmers and stock
owners have promised to aid, and
as the Ilo vicinity has a number
of good stock breeders it prom

games for big purses, and other
amusements have been added

Two Power Sites Inspected
..t 1
Orofino, May 7.—(Special to
the Tribune.) — A party of timber
men, among whom were J. P
Weyerhauser of Tacoma, Wash. ;
F. C. Denkman, of Rock Island,
111. ; C. A. Weyerhauser, of Little
Falls, Minn., and Theodore Fohl,
local agent of the Clearwater
Timber company of this place,
have just returned from a trip of
inspection of the power sites on
the North Fork of the Clearwater
river.
While no information of a
definite nature is being given out
at this time it seems probable
that a storage dam will be con
structed at or near Big Island,
about twenty miles from Orofino,
and another at Bruce's Eddy,
three miles from Orofino. It is
persistently rumored that a com
bination . is probable between
the electric power interests and
the Weyerhauser interests to Use
the Bruce's Eddy power site for
both log storage and power.
This would no doubt mean the
construction of a big milling
plant on the south Bide of the
main river on the mill site proper
ty of the Clearwater Timber
company. A developement of
this magnitude will be a big step
in the opening of the Clearwater
country. The power which can
be supplied by this point will re
move one of the principal ob
stacles prevented to developing
the cement industry as well as
many others at Orofino.
Dramatic Club at Winona
The Cottonwood Dramatic club
will present Tony, the Convict at
the I. O. O. F. hall at Winona
this evening. These talented
young people delightfully pleased
a well-filled house in Cottonwood
with their mirth provoking
drama. Their music and spe
cialties were far above the aver
age, and the people of Winona
can be well assured of getting
their money's worth.
A dance will be given after the
show.
Rhoades For Commissioner
There is strong talk among the
Salmon river people to bring out
Jay Rhoades as commissioner
from that district, in fact such a
demand comes out of that conn
try for his selection that to the
causual observer it would seem
a man would have to have far
more and better excuses than Mr.
Rhoades has to offer to refusé to
run. Jay is a man who has made
a success of his own affairs,
broad and still conservative and
would make an excellent man to
look after the affairs of the
county.—Free Press.
