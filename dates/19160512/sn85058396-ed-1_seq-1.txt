ORDERS SENT TROOPS
Ten Thousand Men to Go Into
Chihuahua and Coahuila
Adequate Force for
Big Bend.
El Paso, May 12. General Obre
gon started south before daybreak to
day. Generals Scott and Funston will
begin their eastward journey at 10:30
o'clock tonight.
Juan N. Amador, sub-secretary of
foreign affairs of the de facto gov
ernment, who participated in the con
ference with General Obregon, called
on General Scott today and reiterat
ed to him assurances that such troop
dispositions aB were necessary to re
store and maintain order along the
northern front already had been or
dered. General Obregon, who will remain
for a few days at Chihuahua, has di
rected General Trevino to send into
tho states of Chihuahua and Coahuila
ten thousand men. These forces
will betaken from Torreon, San Pe
dro, and other points in the southern
part of Coahuila, Trevino's head
quarters will be in Chihuahua City,
Chihuahua.
Force Sent to Big Bend.
Immediate occupation of the dis
trict about Parral has been ordered
and what the Mexicans regard as an
adequate force will be dispatched to
the Big Bend country and every ef
fort made to run down the bandits
and rescue J. Doemer who was cap
tured in the Glenn Springs and Bo
quillas raid. General Scott previous
ly had assured General Obregon and
Mr. Amador that tho withdrawal of
the American troops from the district
below Namiquipa already had begun
and Mr. Amador asserted that this
district would be controlled without
loss of time by the Mexican forces,
Mr. Amador expected to leave to
night for Mexico City where he will
have an important role as sub-Becre-tary
of foreign affairs in the negotia
tions that have reverted to the for
eign offices of the two governments.
To newspapermen, ho insisted that ho
had no doubt of an amicable adjust
ment at an early date.
He explained that the questions in
volved in the protocol governing the
mutual agreement for the crossing of
troops into one and the other coun
tries must be the basis of these ne
gotiations although the withdrawal of
v
the American troops stipulated in
Carranza's note of April 12 must also
be considered. Mr. Amador did not
regard this, however, as an insur
mountable obstacle to a successful
conclusion of the diplomatic negotia
tions about to be resumed at Wash
ington. Troops Not to Stay Indefinitely.
Mr. Amador made it clear that Gen
erals Scott and Funston had reiterat
ed the assertions of the administra
tion that it was not the intention of
he United States government to keep
tho troops in Mexico Indeflniely and
that therefore, he did not attach so
much importance to this as had been
given to it in some quarters.
"And you may be certain," said Mr.
Amador, "that the danger of a con
flict between Mexican troops and
American soldiers pending thes ne
gotiations does not exist."
Mr. Amador emphasized the word
"troops" explaining 'hat it was quite
possible and to be expected thaL any
irresponsible band of armed men
might attack American troops at any
time but that General Obregon, Gen
eral Trevino and other high officers
of Carranza's army, have such con
trol over their men that a movement
by government forces against the
Americans was out of the question.
Obregon's Army Stays In Sonora.
General Obregon's army in Sonora
will remain there for the present, ac
cording to Mr. Amador, although ho
said that a request would probably
be made later for the passage of a
portion of tho troops from Sonora
eastward, either through American
territory or through the American
line of communications.
At the present, he said, neither
General Scott nor General Obregon
regarded it wise, however, to send
the Mexican troops across the Amer
ican lines, "not because we fear that
our troops would cause a conflict,"
said Mr. Amador, "so much as we
fear that they might be atacked by
your troops."
At this Mr. Amador turned his
head ajjd smiled at General Scott.
Secretary of War Baker today sent
to Generals Scott and Funston con
gratulatory telegrams on tho manner
in which they had conducted the ne
gotiations with the Mexican conferees.
ANAESTBETICSllE
SENT TO SOLDIERS
New York, May 12. Small bottles
of anaesthlc now are being placed in

tofore been generally understood, ex
pressed the view that tho Appam did

of the Prussian-American treaty. It
pointed out that the treaty granted

Admission in Sussex Affair

Skepticism in Paris About
Punishment of Submarine
Commander Lieutenant
Has Been Promoted.
Paris, May 12, 5:05 a. m. The of
ficial admission that a German sub
marine torpedoed the Sussex is wide
ly commented on in today's press
which considers that the admission
accentuates Germany's collapse be
fore President Wilson's resolute atti
tude. The Petit Parisien says that an ex
amination of the comments of the
German press shows that it is domi
nated by the 'feeling that Germany
has undergone one of the gravest dip
lomatic checks in her history and that
she dare not answer back to Wash
ington as she would like.
There is considerable skepticism
about the punishment of tho com
mander of the submarine. Marcel
Hutln says:
"We are curious to know, and per
haps the American government will
show the same curiosity, as to what
sort of punishment has been chosen
for the commander of the submarine.
Has not Admiral von Capelle promot
ed Lieutenant Otto Stelnbreck, the
commander of the U-18, which I un
derstand was the submarine which
torpedoed the Sussex?"
Public Feeling Against Germany.
Petrograd, May 12. Tho press con
tinues to comment on the surrender
of Germany to tho demands of the
UnitedtStates.Some- of-j'tlsef -papers
draw a comparison between the firm
attitude of President Wilson and what
they describe as tho desire of the "re
presentatives of American science, po
litical, law and church" for the even
tual triumph of the allies. American
public feeling is declared to be the
best antidote for the two years of
German agitation in the United States.
Copenhagen, via London, May 12,

KEY TO WAR IN
BRIEY VALLEY
Territory Between Verdun and
Metz Occupied by Germans
Rich in Iron Output.
BIG ANNUAL OUTPUT
France Compelled to Import
Iron While Germany Gains
21,000,000 Tons.
Paris, May 12, 5:10 a. m. Senator
Berenger, writing In today's Matin,
says that the key to the war lies in
tho possession of the Brley valley be
tween Verdun and Metz.
"Sinco tho war began," says Sena
tor Berenger, "France, having lost
tho Brley basin, has been obliged to
import almost all their iron from
England and America, while Germany,
having occupied the whole Brley val
ley, is ablo to add 21,000,000 tons to
her own annual output. This explains
tho assiduity of the Germans at Ver
dun. Thoy want to capture the for
tress so as to effectually prevont tho
French from attacking Metz.
"In a confidential memorandum ad
dressed to Chancellor von Bethmann
Ilollweg, on conditions of future
peace by Germany industrial agricul
tural associations on May 20, 1915,
the following passage occurred:
" 'If the production of Iron and
steel had not doubled August A4 the
continuation of the war would have
been Impossible. The Brley region
now produces sixty to eighty per cent
of our iron and steel and If that pro
duction was hampered tho war would
bo practically lost,' "
