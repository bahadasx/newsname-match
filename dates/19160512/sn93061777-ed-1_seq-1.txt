Irvine. Frank Burns resigned
as Secretary which was accepted
and a vote of thanks extended
to the retiring officers C. E.
Dennis and Frank Burns.
CURLESS IS SECRETARY
Bert Curless, who was elected
secretary by acclamation, is one
of the greatest boosters that
Clovis ever had. He has been
on the job continuously for seven
or eight years and has never
been too busy with personal af
fairs to attend a meeting. He
is the man who made them all
sit up and take notice of Clovis
and Curry county at the big
Wichita Kansas fair and he has
always been considered the right
hand bower of the chairman
when he wanted someone that
he could depend upon to do
something. A better selection
could not have been made. It
was decided to hold the banquet
on the 12th at whic h tiaie the
following program will be
rendered:
Hogs Top Market
The two car loads of hogs
which Doui?hton and Nichols
sent to market the first of the
week brought $9.75 or the top
t "ce of the market. They wc re
'.i rst class animals and averaged
LOO pounds each. They will
make another shipment within a
few days.
The city council has ordered
quite a little mere sidewalk on
the east side. There will be
more concrete sidewalk layed
this year than in all years previ
ous. The girls of Miss Jones' S. S.
class will give a pie supper Fri
day night in the basement at the
Baptist church, while the girls
of Mrs. Harris' class will sell ice
cream and cake in connection
with the pie supper.
MILITIAMEN OF
ORDERED
Company "K" of Clovis
to Mobilize, and Left Thursday Evening. Pres
ident Wilson Issues Orders to Texas, New Mex
ico and Arizona Guards. Border Situation
Alarming.
Wilton has issued orders to
the Adjutant Generals of Texas,
New Mexico and Arizona to call
out the militia of these states for
border duty. In the event of
hostilities it may be necessary
for these soldiers to cross the
border, but before they could be
compelled to do so, they would
have to re-enlist in volunteer
companies. Battery "A" of
Roswell with its full quota of
200 men has also been ordered
out and is now en route to the
border. The New Mexico militia
will assemble at Columbus on
the border, the little town that
was sacked by the Villa Bandits.
Besides the militiamen, five
thousand regulars and several
companies of coast artillery are
being sent to the border, making
an expedition of some ten or
twelve thousand men in all.
This will gtve Funston a force
of 50,000 men for service along
the border and in Mexico.
Situation Looks Alarming
General Obregon, the Mexican
war minister, has demanded the
immediate withdrawal of the
American troops in Mexico or
fight the de Facto government.
Carranza has been reported as
saying that if the Americans do
not leave or set a date of leaving
soon, that he will drive them out,
but in the meantime the Ameri
cans are making preparations
for the worst and are not uneasy
about being driventout In fact
if there is any driving to be
done, it is more than likely that
it will be the Mexicans that will
be driven. The Americans have
refused to leave until conditions
have improved.
Patriotic Demonstration
The ICIovis Company "K" en
trained yesterday evening for
the front and their departure
was the occasion for a patriotic
demonstration. The bands play
ed and the friends and relatives
of the brave soldier boys gather
ed at the train to bid them fare
well. These-boys ot ours have
responded to their country's call
:ind are ready and willing to en
dure hardship without a murmur.
Business men left their places of
business to show their appreci
ation with a parting farwell.
Soldier life in time of war is no
fun, it is ro childs play, it is a
serious proposition, but someone
must do it. The honor of your
country, home and fireside de
mand it. Some of these boys
may not return alive. This fact
appealed to many of those who
had assembled. The shallow
minded of course took it as a
joke. In honoring these boys,
you honor yourselves.
Including the new recruits,
some of whom enlisted at the
last moment, the m eraberahip of

They marched from the armory
to the intersection of Main Street
and Grand Avenue where they
were joined by Johnson's band
and all marched to the depot.
THREE STATES
TO THE BORDER
Received Orders Tuesday
It is estimated that two thousand
people assembled at the station
Practically every business house
in town was closed in order that
the employes might show their
respects to "OUR BOYS."
Judge Richardson made a few
touching farewell remarks.
At three thirty the train bear
ing the Carlsbad, Artesia and
Portales militiamen and battery
"A" of Roswell arrived together
with the equipment. The girls
band was there and the two
Clovis bands struck up lively
tunes. It was patriotic. Thou
sands cheered. It was the first
time anything of the kind had
ever occurred in Clovis. The
Clovis company was photograph
ed at the station platform and
at five o'clock the train departed
for Belen where it will meet the
Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Vegas
and Raton guards when all will
proceed to Columbus for service.
1st Lieutenant Hobart Miller re
mained behind for the purpose
of securing and training recruits.
Another Raid
El Paso, Texas, May 7. -Three
American soldiers and a 10-year-old
boy have lost their lives and
two American citizens have been
kidnapped and carried south of
the international boundary to al
most certain death, in another
raid of Mexican bandits that
takes rank with Panoho Villa's
famous attack on Columbus, N.
M. Whether the marauders
were Villistas or Carranxistas is
not known.
The bandits foray, carrying
them through the southern
limits of Brewster county; in the
Big Bend district of Texas, and
taking in three little settlements
near the border Glen Springs,
Boquillas and Deemers took
place on Friday night and Satur
day morning, but news of it did
not reach here until today.
REINFORCEMENTS SENT.
Within an hour preparations
had begun for adequate military
action. Major General Fred
erick Funston ordered that in all
four troop3 of cavalry .should
proceed to the raided section to
reinforce small detachments al
ready on the awne. from 1'ie---idio,
Alpine and other convenii:!it
points.
Thtiso troops got under way
tonijiht. It is said hero that if
the exigencies of the ca.e do
mands such action they will
cross the border in order to run
down and .disperse the bandits.
According to Major Meyer, the
bandits, about seventy-five in
number, crossed the Rio Grande
from the Mexican side late Fri
day afteraoon at a point a few
miles south of Terlingua, Texas,
where there is a guard of about
thirty men.
From there they proceeded
eastward through the desolate
reaches of the Big Bend country
over an old wagon road toward
Glen Springs, a small ranch

A thirty foot brick extension
will be built to the Havener
building on South Main Street,
which is occupied by Mandells
Dry Goods and Clothing Store;
The brick has been ordered and
he contract awarded to R. L.
Pryor. In addition to the exten
sion, a new front will be install
ed in the dry goods department
on the north side. It will be
what is termed as a promenade
front with doors inset twelve
feet from the front line of the
building. The only other fronts
like it in the state are Kittle and

Albuquerque. This enlarge
ment will give Mr. Mandell a
floor space of 50x110 feet. It
will enable him to display his
goods to an advantage and will
be one of the most attractive
stores in the country.
Tom" Cooper Killed
J. T. (Tom) Cooper, employed
by the Santa Fe as switchman,
was accidentally killed in the
Belen yards Tuesday morning.
So far as can be learned, there
were no eye witnesses and the
manner in which Mr. Cooper
met his death will probably
never be known. His watch
stopped at 10:48, indicating that
the accident occurred at that
time. His body was found short
ly after 11:00 o'clock, badly man
gled. Mr. Cooper had been em
ployed by the Santa Fe for about
three years, mostly in the capac
ity of brakeman. He formerly
resided in Clovis, but was trans
ferred to Belen last fall, out of
which point he worked as brake
man until about two months ago.
when he accepted service in the
yard. His parents live in Carls
bad. He was married and his
wife lives in El Paso.
To Voters of Curry County
My attention has been called
to a circular letter headed:
"Office of W. C. Zerwer, Candi
date for County Clerk" and
signed by "W. C. Zerwer" and
in the Circular the above men
tioned candidate for County
Clerk states that his "predeces
sor used embossed letter heads
and envelopes that cost the
County $25 00 per thousand."
I want to say to the voters of
Curry County that this is not a
statement of facts. The records
will disclose that the highest
prices ever paid for the best
grades of stationary for special
use did not cost one third of that
amount and that the above men
tioned candidate for County
Clerk helped select the station
ary and signed his own name
on the order as Deputy Clerk.
Sofcie other statements in the
circular are in proportion as to
facts.
A. L Await.
