ATLANTIC CITY POLICE
CHARGED WITH RIOTING.
Five Patrolmen and a Police Sergeant
Are in Jail.
Atlantic City, N. J, May 11. Nine
men are in jail here today on charges
of rioting. Five pf them are city pa
trolmen and a sixth ia a police Ber
gcant. Warrants are out for others on
the came charges growing out of the
drHturoance- last night when the
Kuehnle-Bacharaoh political faction
held a parade to celebrate the victory
it won at the Rolls on .Tuesday... -On
that day it elected all five of its can
didates for city commissioner, . giving
tt control of the city government after
next week.
In the parade there was carried a
coffin on which was pasted a picture of
Mayor William Riddle, one of the de
feated candidates. Sympathizers of
the mayor attacked the men carrying
the coffin and the parade broke up in
the riot. The fighting lasted fifteen
minutes and there are -a number of
blackened eyes and cut faces in the
city.
It is almost certain there will be a
grand Jury investigation of the elec
tion. The public -prosecutor had
threatened there would be an inquiry
if anything out of the way was discov
ered at the polls. At the time this was
generally believed to be a warning to
"strong arm'' men, but what the prose
cutor referred to was the use of
money. It is now said that consider
able sums were spent with intent to
Influence tho vote.

bassador, last February, for feeding
the civilian population of Poland by

The acceptanee carries, however.
certain rather difficult stipulations for
the central powers, namely, that the
relief must be applied to that portion
of Poland in Austrian occupation and
not confined, as Germany desires, to
tnat part occupied Dy Germany, t It
Is stipulated that the food is shipped
from the United States In German
ships under a neutral flag and further
that Germany and Austria agree as

The foreign office expresses the hope
that the central powers will promptly
accept the conditions, so as to hasten
the putting of tne scheme Into opera

of the American commission for re
lief in Belgium, will go to Brussels to

BORDER CONFERENCES
Whole Matter Referred to Settlement
in Diplomatic Channels.,
El Paso, Texas, May 11. After al
most two weeks of discussion the con
ferences of uenerals Hugh L. Soott,
Frederick Funston and Alvaro Obre
gon, Mexican minister of war, over
American troop dispositions in Mexi
co, came to an end tonight without
any agreement being reached.
The whole matter was referred back
to the American and de facto govern
ments to be settled through diplomatic
channels.
No Change in Situation.
Tonight the situation is almost ex
actly -where it stood 4 before the con
ferences began. The Mexican govern
ment still insists on the withdrawal
of General Pershing's columns upon
a certain date and wants that date to
come 'quickly. It Is known that Gen
eral Obregon has been willing to make
concessions in order to reach an
agreement with the American confer
ees. ' He has been overruled, however,
by the first chief, Venustiano Carran-
za, and his advisors. After virtually
conceding the demands of the Ameri
can conferees he was compelled to
reverse his attitude. -
, Negotiations Come to an End.
The end of the negotiations came
today after two conferences had been
held. The first began at 10 o'clock
in the morning and lasted until 1 p.
m., when a recess was taken until 4
o'clock to permit General Obregon to
keep a lunch engagement. Sharp on
the hour the discussions were renew
ed. After two hours and a half, how
ever, they were brought to an end.
General Obregon, accompanied by
Juan N. Amador. Mexican sub-secre
tary of foreign affairs, emerged from
tne private car occupied by Generals
Funston and Scott, walked rapidly
down the railway yards, climbed into
his waiting automobile and drove
away.
General Obregon was accompanied
to his machine by General Funston.
The Mexican conferee's manner was
abrupt and vexed, but General Fun
ston smiled cheerily as he bade him
good bye. .
General Funston re-entered the car.
Then Colonel Robert E. Lee Mlchie,
aide to General Scott, came out and
distributed copies of the following
statement . to the waiting newspaper
men: Statement Given Out
"We wish to announce that,' after
several conferences, marked through
