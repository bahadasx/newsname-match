DURING CONSTRUCTION OF NEW
BARN, NEAR PIERZ—WIND
CAUSED ACCIDENT
Three men were seriously injured at
about 8:30 Wednesday morning on the
Henry Langer farm, located about a
mile west of Pierz village, when the
rafters on a barn on which they were
working, were blown over by the
strong wind. The injured men are
•Christ Langer, Henry Smith and Louis
Spanfellner, all of Pierz.
Chas. Farrow of this city, who re
ported the accident, stated that when
"he was on his way to Pierz at about
8 o'clock Wednesday morning the
men weTe putting up the rafters on
the barn, which was completed with
the exception of the roof. Thev had
sixteen of the rafters up and intend
ed to put all of them up before brac
ing them, but just as they had put the
sixteenth one into place a gust of
wind caught them and tore them
down. Smith and Spanfellner were
on the rafters, about five or six feet
from the top, and about forty feet
from the ground, when the rafters
gave way.
Mr. Spanfellner was most seriously
injured. He landed on his head, his
face striking the lumber on the
ground. His lip was badly cut, a big
gash was cut over his right eye, his
nose and cheek bone were broken,
and he was otherwise bruised about
the face. Mr. Smith's arm was brok
«n. Christ Langer, who was handing
the rafters to the men on the barn,
was struck by the falling lumber and
had his right leg broken above the
thigh. He saw the rafters fall, Mr.
Farrow said, but instead of running
away from the barn he ran directly
under the falling mass.
TOOK POWDER FOR CARBON
Explosion in Stove Results and George
Gerritz is Badly Burned
The resemblance of powder to car
bon was responsible for a painful ac
cident to George Gerritz of First ave
nue southeast Wednesday morning,
when he threw some powder into a
cookstove in which he had started the
morning fire.
The top of the stove was blown off
«nd the doors were blown open, the
flame igniting Mr. Gerritz's shirt and
"burning his right hand and wrist bad
ly, as well as singeing his. face. Just
as the accident happened Mrs. Gerritz
came into the kitchen and quickly
quenched the flames in her husband's
•clothing. Mr. Gerritz states that it
was fortunate that his wife was on
the spot so soon, as at the time he
seemed to be helpless.
Mr. Gerritz says that the powder
(one-half pound), had been in the
house for 20 years, and had become
caked, that during most of the time
they also had in the house a quantity
of carbon which had been used in the
old style flatiron, and which resem
bled the powder. About three years
ago Mr. Gerritz threw away what he
thought was the powder, and on the
morning of the accident the supposed
to-be carbon fell off a shelf, and Mr.
Gerritz thought he might as well get
rid of it also as it was of no use. He
did and with the above result.
PLAY FT. RIPLEY SUNDAY
LOCALS WILL TRY TO EVEN UP
THINGS WITH THEM AT
PAIR GROUNDS
The local baseball team has secured
a game with Ft. Ripley to be played
at the fair grounds Sunday afternoon,

this time they will be able to turn the
tables and give the visitors a real
drubbing. The lineup will be strength
ened considerebly. The game will be
called at 2:30 p. m.
An effort may be made to get a
game for Decoration Day. Royalton
was asked for this game but they will
not have a team in the field this year.
GUN CLUB MAY ORGANIZE
Arrangements May Be Made for Han
dicap Tournament to be Held Here
A meeting of all those interested in
the organization of a gun club will
very likely be called for this evening,
and if possible, the club will arrange
for a handicap tournament-to be held
here some time this summer. The
meeting would bring from 25 to 30 of
the best trap shooters in the state to
this city for the event. Prizes would
be awarded to the winners.
At the meeting toniprht officers will
be elected and some decision will be
made as to the location of the traps.
They are now on the fair grounds but
will be removed from there and will
probably be placed on the grounds
west of the old Antlers hotel building
on the West side.
DRIVING CREW CALLED TO MIN
NEAPOLIS
Webb's crew of men, who were to
"begin driving within a few days at
Brainerd, were called to Minneapolis
on Monday to handle a large amount
of runaway logs which were released

ter caused the booms to break. Mr.
Webb and his men were towing the
wangans, bateaus, etc., up the river
from here when they were called, and
they had to leave them at the Ft.
Ripley bridge. Ed. Lavoie and his
crew are now towing the boats to
Brainerd.

INVESTIGATE ELECTRIC SERVICE
COUNCIL TAKES ACTION IN HOS
PITAL MATTER AND ON SATES
FOR LIGHT SERVICE
A special meeting of the city coun
cil was held at the city hall Monday
evening for the purpose ef ascertain
ing what rights the city has relative
to the furnishing of electric power by
the Water Power company of this
iejtjrt:,'JIfhe meeting was called by
Mayor Fortier as a result of the fail
ure of "the Franciscan Sisters tomake
satisfactory arrangements jwitk the:
company for service at thi6 Hew hfo|^
pital. The mayor' also brought up the
matter of the charge of 10 cents a
drop made to local patrons of the
company, there being a belief among
many that. ..this charge is unfair. A.
committee of four from the council
was appointed to investigate the first
named matter and to have an exjMa$
electrician from the twin cities come
up and give his advice on the hospital
question, and* the committee was ask
ed to Teport at a meeting to be held
the following Thursday evening. They
were also asked to gather information
as to the righto of the citizens on. any
questions of this kind whicn may come
up in the future and to make a report
of this also. The chairman was also
asked to appoint a committee of ten
or twelve citizens to investigate the
matter of charges for lighting service
in this city.
Mayor Fortier explained to the
council why he had called the meet
ing. He said that the Mother Superior
at the hospital had told him that shfr
had tried to get the Water Power com
pany to furnish the hospital with the
service asked for, even to paying one
half of the cost of building the line,
but without avail. Many persons, the
mayor stated, has asked him to call
a special meeting of the council to find
out what rights the citizens have in
regard to such cases, as well as the
fixing of rates for lighting service.
T. C. Gordon, representing the Wla:
ter Power company, gave the follow
ing explanation of the hospital mat
ter: The wires connecting with the
new hospital are for single phase ser
vice, whereas the plans and specifica
tions of the building call for a 2-phase
motor to operate the elevator. Archi
tect Harris gave the contractors to
understand that there was 2 or 3-phase
service there, Mr. Gordon said,, and it
was only four or five months ago that
he found out that the one-phase was
the only kind available. He said that
since that time he wrote to Mr. Har?
ris, explaining the matter, and he re:
ceived the answer that the single
phase motor would not operate the
elevator. Mr. Gordon stated that he
answered Harris and told him that
he was surprised that he would make
such a statement. gaid
also wrote to the* jjfbther Superior,
explaining the matter to her and en
closing copies of the letters written to
Mr. Harris. A meeting was later ar
ranged for at the hospital, but Mr.
Harris failed to present himself, Mr.
Gordon said. He added that he be
lieved that the real cause for the
trouble was the additional cost of a
single-phase motor. The architect
claimed +^at the difference would be
about $375.
Mr. Gordon claimed that he sug
gested to the architect that direct
current be used, t0 which the archi
tect replied that it could not be se
cured. He savs he told the architect
that it could be made bv means of a
generator and that the cost would not
evceed $600. or less than it would cost
the hosmtal to cet the 2-rhase ser
vice. He added that it would be pre
posterous foT the company to run cop
per wires from First avenue south
east. near the* Buckman hotel, to the
hospital or to any other tdace, for
this kind of service. It would Teauire
an additional expense on account of
special wiring in the hospital build
ing, and the Mother Superior was told
that it was ridiculous to try to get
the 2-phase service when the direct
current service would be better and
could be secured cheaper. Mr. Gordon
pointed out that most of the machines
used by the surgeons in their work
at the hospital could better be oper
ated with direct current. He said
that Architect Harris or anvone else
do not know what he is talking
about when they say that an elevator
like the one at the new hospital will
not work with anything else than a
2-phase motor^ He believed that the
company, by installing a transformer
specially for the hospital, would be
a

will be making big money if they get
cents per month from the current

EXPERT ENGINEER SAYS DIRECT
CURRENT MOTOR IS AS GOOD
AS 2-PHASE
A generator and a direct current
motor will likely be installed at the
new Franciscan Sisters' hospital here
for the operation of the elevator, as
the result of the decision of Mr.
Cooper, an expert electrical engineer
from Minneapolis, who said that the
single phase motor witHj geB^teti^r
and^ direct current moterTis jam as
good as the 2f*phase motor.
The controversy, which is -explained
in another columD^ resultea in lie ap
pointing of a council committee which
was given power to get an expert elec
trician from the twin cities to come
and give his expert advice in the mat
ter. The Water Power company
agreed to abide by his decision, which
covers their contention.
Mr. Cooper met with the committee
from the council, Mr. Harris, the ar
chitect, and the elevator man, and
afterward went to the hospital to
make an examination of the building,
etc. Mr. Cooper stated that in his
opinion the single phase motor, with
a generator and direct motor equip
ment is equally as good as the
2-phase motor, and costs less to oper
ate and to install than the 2-phase
motor and line. The cost to the hos
pital, however, in using the. one-phase
motor with direct current equipment
will be $600 more than the 2-phase.
Practically all elevators in the twin
cities are operated by this current,
he said. About the only difference is
that with the 2-phase service the ele
vator can be started simply with the
operation of a lever, whereas with the
direct current and generator a button
must first be pressed. As to safety,
believed that it is just as safe and
serviceable as the 2-phase motor.
The procuring of a single-phase mo
tor is likely to delay the opening of
the hospital for some time.
As the parties have reached an
agreement, the committee will not
make a report until a regular meeting
of the council.
The Ladies' Aid of the Swedish
Lutheran church will be entertaiued
at the church parlors Thursday after
noon of next week by Mrs. J. Gran
