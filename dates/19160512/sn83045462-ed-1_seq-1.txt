LONDON", May 12.?Premier
Asquith arrived in Dublin today
and was taken in an automobile
to the vice regal lodge. Tlic
premier's program for the day
was first a conference with departmental
chiefs and afterward
consultation with Gen. Maxwell
in regard to the military situation.
which is well in hand.
It is reported that in all likelii

Mied shortly abolishing martial
law. the provisions of which have
been greatly modified in the last
few days.
The situation in some parts of
the provinces is said to be still
rather disturbed, and it is likely
that military control will continue
in these districts for some time
onger.
Will Meet Deputation.
Premier Asquith intended to meet
several civilian deputations so as to
learn at Urst hand their ideas concern- \
in* the reconstruction of the destroyed I
portions of Dublin and perhaps to!
formulate a plan for compensation.
There is relief apparent among the population
at the promised cessation of
executions, which were beginning to
ause considerable agitation.
Premier Asquith's visit to Ireland is
'riving the political experts much food
or thought. The London morning papers
speculate variously as to exactly
w hat he expects to accomplish. The
Daily News' lobby correspondent believes
that Mr. Asquith's idea is to
?ound Irish opinion on the spot as to
the possibility of a deal or a compromise
over the home-rule question, a
deal which might include putting into
effect immediately some measure of
home rule, coupled perhaps with the
inclusion of Ireland in the military
compulsion bill.
Home Rule Compromise Sought.
While the controversy over the
ause>, and manner of handling the insurrection
is still in progress efforts
are being made to reach a compromise
on the home rule question. Those who
most desire this are urging that Ia>rd
Hardinge. after he has concluded his
inquiry into the disturbances, shall be
appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland. It
is believed that a diplomat would be
more likely to bring the two parties together
than would a politician. There
are rumors in parliamentary circles
that negotiations of some kind are
being arranged, and that Sir Edward
?"arson ar.d John Redmond, the leaders
>{ rim two parties, are concerned with
t hern.
The Marquis of Lansdowne intimated
to tii# Louse of lords that the riisarma
i.t of all Ireland will be undertaken.
This \ould mean the disarmament of
tne lister and nationalist volunteers.
a\d whether that ? an be done, depends
o . Sir Edward Larson and John Redmond
more than on any other indi\
iduals.
The house of commons negatived,
without division. John Dillon's motion
demanding that the government should
Immediately declare its intention.
Dillon Attacks Government.
Mr. Dillon, one of the most respected
of the nationalists, but often one of the
bitterest antagonists of British rule,
attacked the government in the house
1;i a speech which, for hitter denunciat
on, has not been surpassed at West
U*;t of the whole of Ireland. Mr. Dil'
ion said, there were only four or five
spo's where .her*- was insurrection,
yet the whole Country was under rnart
?! lav.-, and there was absolutely no
t ice of ?he iI administration. The
Jrish people, he declared, would refuse
to accept the well-known high eharaet<
r of Gen .Maxwell a? the sole puar*
h ntee of th?i; liberties, and 1? t'ne military
rule was to be continued the
ernment bad better get ready .<> ?,t'OO
men to garrison the country.
M !? esent everything conceivable,
*?iu Mr. DiHon. was being done to
spread dlsaffect ion throughout^ the
uuiitry. Limerick. Clare and Mayo
<o"nties were not in a disturbed condition.
and their reward was the sending
of troops to make arrests.
"Washing Out Life Work/'
"If Treland were governed by men
out of bedlam." shotted Mr. Dillon,
"they could not pursue a more insane
policy. You are letting loose a river
of blood between two races which,
after 300 years of hatred, we had nearly
succeeded in bringing together. You
are washing out our whole life work
in a sea of blood."
This and other telling points In his
speech were received with loud cheeri
from the nationalist benches.
After declaring that the primary object
of his amendment was to put an
absolute and final stop to the executions.
Mr. Dillon proceeded:

of Ireland is largely in
the hands of the Dublin clubs. What

CONTROLLER AGAIN
I CALLED TO COURT
Williams Subpoenaed to Produce
November, 1906, Report
of Examiner Reeves.
SESSIONS ON SATURDAYS.
SUGGESTED BY DEFENSE
Time Today Occupied by Reading: of j
MnArlnn'e Ancnrpr tn
Riggs Injunction Suit.
Another subpoena upon John Skclton
^"illiams. controller of the currency,
who is blamed by Riggs Bank officials
for what they term "persecution" and
being responsible for legal action leading
up to their indictment on charges
of perjury, was issued today at the instance
of counsel for the defendants.
This subpoena calls upon the controller
to produce in court Monday the
report of Owen Reeves, a national
bank examiner, regarding the condition
of Riggs National Bank as of November
26, 1906.
Call for this report from the defense
was taken by prominent attorneys in the
courtroom as indicating that the defense
was so well pleased with the 1913 report
of National Bank Examiner Samuel
Hann, a photographic copy of which was
placed at their disposal yesterday in response
to subpoena, that they believe
they can materially strengthen their cause
by reference to the report of Examiner
Reeves, who was Examiner Hann's predecessor.
The subpoena, which was drawn by
Attorney Frank J. Hogan. identifies the
report required as that in which the
examiner makes the statement. "President
Glover says the bank pays its officers
for their services, and for this reason the
brokerage commissions go to the bank."
Suggests Sitting Saturday.
Attorney J. J. Darlington for the defense
suggested at the opening of court
today that the trial of Ri^gs Bank officials
continue on Saturdays to expedite
the proceedings and relieve the hardship
on members of the jury. Justice Siddons
said: "I will take the suggestion
under consideration."
After the luncheon recess Justice Siddons
announced there would he no sessions
of the court on Saturday.
Both sessions of the court today were
consumed in the reading by the government
of Secretary McAdoo's answer
to the suit of the bank officials for an
injunction to restrain him and Controller
Williams from an alleged conspiracy
to wreck the bank and other
papers regarding the progress of the
controversy between the United States
Treasury officials and Riggs Bank officials
antecedent to the issuance of indictments
against Charles J. Glover,
president: William J. Flather, a vice
president, and H. H. Flather, former
cashier of fhe Riggs Bank.
These records included newspaper articles
regarding the taking over of
the United States Trust Company by
the Munsey Trust Company and proposed
investigation of the' charge that
Controller Williams had shown undue
favoritism in effecting the absorption
' of the United States Trust Company
by the Munsey Trust Company, instead
of permitting the- arrangements made
by the clearing house bank and the
acting controller of the currency to
protect depositors of the United State*! ;
Trust Company, to stand undisturbed.
United States Attorney John E. I^askev
and Assistant United States Attorney
James B. Archer alternated in reading
these records and newspaper articles
to the jury.

Employes in Government
Fay Measure.
The Nolan "three-dollar-a-day bill"
was reported to the House today from
the labor committee, with an amend - !
merit including the employes of the'
District of Columbia. It provides that
no employe of the federal or District
government shall work for less than
j $3 a day, and in the case of men and
1 women working less than eight hours
I a day, an amendment was added providing
that this class of workers shall
be paid 37cents an hour. Representative
Xolan of California, who
wrote the bill, was <?Trected by the
labor committee today to prepare a
report for the House.
Must Be in Service Two Tears.
The committee today adopted a subcommittee
suggestion and wrote Jnto
the bill the proviso that the minimum
I of $3 a day be applied only to employes
; who have been in the service of the
j District of Columbia or United States
I for two years and who are twenty-one
' years or older. It also provided that
j the bill should not apply to fourth-class
postmasters who are holding civil positions
at the same time they are drawing
a salary from the government.
The report is the result of hearings
which have attracted widespread attention.
as some of the facts laid before
the labor committee tend to show that
' minimum government wages at present
do not cover the cost of living, according
to present standards and prices.

Republican Politicians at Capitol
Not Perturbed by Latest
Pronunciamento.
SAY HE CANNOT WIN
AT CHICAGO CONVENTION
Colonel's Latest Statement Will Forward
Hughes Boom. It
Is Believed.
No perturbation was caused among
republican politicians at. the t^apitol
over Col. Roosevelt's latest pronunciamento
regarding: his possible candidacy
for the regular republican presidential
nomination. It was noted, in
fact, that there was nothing new in it,
as he took pains to reiterate that he
had refused to indorse the use of his
name in the primaries and would not
enter a factional contest at Chicago.
He would, only take the nomination
I with the understanding that it was
'tendered him upon his platform of preparedness,
patriotism, "anti-hyphenism"
and all that sort of thing.
Well informed republicans in Congress
insist that Roosevelt cannot, win
I the Chicag9 convention. The highest
estimate of the number of straightout
Roosevelt delegates in the convention
is 87 and the lowest d."?. There is said
to be no chance for a stampede, as the
favorite son delegates and the Hughes
sentiment will stand as an effectual
| bar.
Aids Hughes Boom. Is Claim.
It was said that the only effect of the
sudden and belated burst of effort ir
behalf of Roosevelt will be to forwarc
the Hughes boom. The men who arc
suggesting Mr. Hughes will be glad, il
was said, to have the Roosevelt outbreak
come at this time. They have
observed with some concern that evei
since the word passed around a fortnight
ago that Roosevelt was "stopped,'
I there had been a diminution of talk foi
J their favorite.
The suspicion was growing that ir
I some quarters at least Mr. Hughes
name had been used as a club over Roose'
velt, and after its efficacy had beet:
proved, there were indications of disposition
to lay aside the "club." It wil
be recalled that there was much talk ol
a combination of "the field" against
Hughes, to hold down the conventior
until the avowed candidates and favorite
sons could hare a try-trot.
Reappearance of a Roosevelt boom
even in its old trappings and withoul
additional caparison or paraphernalia
! surely will, it was said today, stimu|
late "interest in the suggestion of Air
[Justice Hughes' desirability as a candidate.
?
Queries as to Justice Hughes.
And speaking of Mr. Justice Hughes
it is pertinent to remark that in th?
last ten days there has been much dis
cussion in quarters which recognize his
desirability as a candidate as to his
availability. Inquiries have come frorr
the west particularly upon two points
first, will he take the nomination i!
given to him? second, what does Mr.
Hughes stand for on national and international
policies?
Mr. Justice Hughes is referred to by
many politicians as "the man of mystery."
They say they have no assura'nee
that he A-ill accept the nomination.
while believing that he will
neither do they know what kind of a
platform he would want to run on.
No One to Give Answer.
There is no one to appeal to for ar
answer. He has no manager, no campaign,
no sponsor and no authorized
| spokesman except the "voice of th?
people" said to be demanding his nomi|
nation. People approaching the justict
himself are liable to be Invited intc
the woodsned. metaphorically speaking,
and eet a lambasting. He is absolutely
intolerant of suggestion thai
he is in any way concerned in politics
No politician, however, especially
none connected with the camps of th<
avowed candidates, for a moment minimizes
the seriousness of the movernenl
for Mr. Justice Hughes. It is acceptec
as an ever present menace to each admitted
candidacy to such an extent thai
no actual candidate sees a fighting
chance for himself as long as there car
be said to be a Hughes boom.

LONDON, May 12.?Hard fighting has
been resumed in the vicinity of Dead
Man hill on the Verdun front, the Germans
making another attempt to dislodge
the French from positions on the slope
of the hill the capture of which May 10
was reported by the Paris war office.
Two attacks in quick succession were delivered
last night, but both were repulsed
by the French fire, the Paris war office
announced today.
[ Increase in the violence of the artillery
fire In other sectors of the Verdun front
is reported, the region especially subjected
to the shelling being that between
Dead Man hill and the Avocourt wood, to
the southwest. In the Douaumont-Vaux
district, east of the Meuse, the bombardment
is being continued.
French Statement.
The text of the French statement follows
:
"On the left bank of the Meuse fVeri

activity from the sector of the wood of
I Avocourt to Dead Man hill. The Ger;
mans vainly attempted to dislodge us
- during the night from the positions we

repulsed by our fire.
"On the jrtght bank the bombardment.
^ in the region of Douaumont-Vaux was

i the front."
British Official Report.
I The following British official communi"
cation was issued last night:
r "The enemy made an unsuccessful at[
tempt to raid our trenches near Orvillers
last night. Today there has been
- mining activity near Beaumont, Hamer
and Fricourt. both sides blowing up

with us.
"The artillery on both sides has been
active about Angres and southeast of
Ypres. At the Hohenzollern redoubt a
severe mutual bombardment developed
this afternoon."
PEACE SENTIMENT FOUND

NEW YORK. May 12.?Samuel S. McClure,

Copenhagen last night on the steamer

for peace only In Germany and
A nst ria.
'T have visited ^11 the belligerent
nations and did not find a suggestion
of peace anywhere except in those two
countries, where the people desire It
for commercial reasons only," said Mr.
McClure.
"By that I mean they wish to resume
their business relations frith other nations,
not that they fear defeat. The
English, French, Russians, Belgians,
Italians, Germans, Austrians, Hungarians,

confident of victory for their respective
armies and determined to fight to the
end."

FAIRBANKS LOOMS UP
| FOR G. 0. P. NOMINATION
Many Arguments Advanced in
Favor of Indiana Man's
Selection.
Former Vice President * Charles W.
Fairbanks of Indiana is beginning to
loom up for the republican presidential
nomination, according to a number of
republicans who will be delegates in
the convention and who have been visiting
Washington within the last few
days.
The arguments in his behalf are numerous.
according to these delegates.
I He ought not he objectionable to Col.
Roosevelt; although a conservative by
disposition, be is progressive in his
views: he knows the tariff better than
the majority of the republicans talked
of for the nomination: he is a favorite
among the real workers of the party,
i 4i.. ??-1ia voaiuI th*?ir time and
money before and at election time; lie
is a good speaker and an able man; lie
worild aid materially in healing the
factional differences.
Col. Michael Dady of Brooklyn, one
of the delegates to the coming national
convention, is a sample of those who
are now looking toward Fairbanks.
Col. Dady intimated that there are
others among the New York delegates
who may find Fairbanks so acceptable
that they will turn to him after a few
complimentary ballots have been cast.
Represents Old Guard View.
Col. Dady represents, of course, the
old guard view of the party, and his
veering to Fairbanks at a time when
J Roosevelt, Root and Hughes, ail from
his own state, are to he voted for in
the convention, is considered as very
significant. He is fond of Root, but
feels that the ex-senator cannot he j
elected, and the old guard wants a
winner. I
Two delegates to the convention of
progressive tendencies, also privately for
Fairbanks, but insisting that their names I
be withheld, also want a winner, they I
said, and they do not know who else j
would meet their requirements. They de- I
clared tiiat Mr. Fairbanks has kept out '
of the party rows of the last few years:
has not spoken harshly of any man, but
has hewed to the line of republican poll- 1
cies and traditions.
Co-Operated Wtih Roosevelt.
It is admitted by old guard and progressive
delegates that whoever is nominated
must not be objectionable to Col.
Roosevelt. Tney ao noc umjersianu now
Col. Roosevelt could find fault with Fairbanks,
who as Vice President co-operated
four years with Roosevelt In the
White House. Mr. Fairbanks, It Is recalled,
was uniformly courteous and
thoughtful to Mr. Roosevelt as President
and did nothing that the latter could
criticise.
As far as he could possibly do so as
Vice President he co-operated with Col.
Roosevelt. Neither ever gave an exhibition
of particular love for the other,
but each preserved dignified co-operation
with tlie other.
In a half dozen delegations from the
big republican states of the country it
has become known there is latent
strength for Fairbanks. Former Gov. )
Franklin Murphy of New Jersey, a
delegate to the convention, is an example.
He may vote for Root on the i
first ballot, but after that is for Fair- I
banks if there is a chance for the
nomination of the Indian#- man.
Refuses to Free Liebknecht.
AMSTERDAM. May 12.?The reich

DEPARfflENTBUILDING
Today Is Time Set for the Blowing
Up of Agriculture
Structure.
Detectives Stringfellow, Springman,
Embrey and Hughlett today are doing:
duty about the main building of the
Department of Agriculture in anticipation
of a visit by the writer of the
anonymous letters containing a statement
that the structure would be blown
up today. Chief Clerk Reese had the
guard doubled and arranged to take
all the precautions necessary for the
protection of the building.
Two searches of the building were
made for explosives. Every room, nook
and corner of the structure was carefully
examined, but nothing was found *
to suggest the possibility of arrangements
having been made to destroy it.
Clerks in the building today are
spending part of their time at work and
part looking for the unexpected to happen.
It was said at the building this
morning that the structure was so carefully
guarded that no intruder carrying
a bomb or infernal machine of any kind
could possibly get where he could do
damage.
Few Leaves of Absence.
It was expected#* hat there would be a
rush of applicants for leave of absence
today, but, it is stated, only a few such
applications were received. If any of j
the male contingent suffered nervous
shocks because of the receipt of the
threatening letters, it is stated, they
did not make it known.
"We have a number of elderly persons
employed in the main building."
said Chief Clerk Reese, "and several
women were permitted to take holiday
today. Not a single male employe in
the inain building, however, asked for
leave of absence."
Maj. Pullman and Inspector Grant
last night had Detectives O'Dea,
Messer, Vermillion and Boyle on guard
at the building. Tonight Detectives

Diplomatic Exchanges Are Expected (

Parleys at El Paso.
Secretary Baker announced after today's
cabinet meeting that no change
in the Mexican policy had been decided
upon. No new orders for militia organ- |
izations to go to the border were in
contemplation, he said, and indicated
that no general intervention in Mexico ]
was being thought of at present. I
In the meantime -American troops *
will be so arranged that th?y will be s
ready to meet any eventuality and pro- (tect
the American border. c
Secretary Baker laid before the cabi- 1
net the latest information from Gen. 1
Scott, and said that for the present he (
thought there were sufficient American *
troops along the border to handle the
situation. If conditions grow more *
alarming, however, additional guards- (
men will be called out. *
<
Scott Called to Washington. i
Secretary Baker left immediately after
the cabinet meeting for visits to At- ^
lantic City and Newark, N. J. President 1
Wilson *pfans to leave tonight on the
naval yacht Mayflower for a week-end ]
trip down the Potom?.c, returning Sun- ?
day night or Monday morning. '*
Upon receiving word today from Maj.
Gen. Hugh Scott that the border con- ,
ferences with Gen. Obregon had been ,
closed without agreement, Secretary ,
Baker announced that he had directed .
Gen. Scott to return to Washington and j
(Jen. Funston to return to his head- (
quarters at San Antonio, Tex. I }
Gen. Scott's report, which was in j j
amplification of the official statement \
issued by the conferees at El Paso last j j
night, was transmitted to Secretary .
Lansing and also was considered at the ,
cabinet meeting. Its contents were not
disclosed, but there were some indica- j
tions of an unwritten agreement hav- a
ing been formulated to cover co-opera- ,
tive action along the border for the j
present.
Interchanges All Friendly.
Secretary Baker said the conferees
had tried to reach a basis for a writ- t
ten agreement, but found it impossible. 1
although all interchanges were of the (
most friendly character. <
It was suggested that Gen. Car- 1
ranza, faced by the political situation 1
in Mexico, was unwilling to make any I
written agreement to which his opponents
could point as indicating a \
surrender of sovereign rights. Under \
that theory. Gen. Obregon. it is understood.
has given assurances that every j
possible means will be employed by his \
government to aid in the speedy ex- ,
termination of the bandits, while the j
formal diplomatic discussion of the
withdrawal suggestions proceeds. It is \
possible that neither side will endeavor (
to force the negotiations while the ! j
disturbed condition along the border : j
continues. | ,
Secretary Baker said no steps to send j 1
additional National Guardsmen or regu- \ s
lars to the border were in immediate *
contemplation. It was made plain, how- j t
ever, that should Gen. Funston again find ; r
his border guard too thin to protect J
American towns and ranches, there would i
be no hesitation in calling out more state i
troops. So far, however, it was said not '
even preliminary steps in this direction ! t
have been taken. j ^
Funston's Orders Not Changed. j 1
Gen. Funston returns to San Antonio \
with his original orders altered in no
way. He has full authority to dispose ^
his men either in Mexico or along the
border. ^
Despite the final break in the El Paso a
parleys, officials here did not appear to
consider the relations between the j
American and Carranza governments
unduly strained. They believed the V
governments even yet might reach an ! j.
understanding.
Gen. Scott's report on the circum- 8
stances leading to the concluding of 8
discussions with Gen. Obregon was j1
awaited today with much interest. It 11
was considered probable that it jvould
be studied carefully for several days
before formal discussions are resumed ?
with Mr. Arredondo. b
Diplomatic relations now are precisely a
the same as before the military confer- *
ences started at El Paso about two ,
weeks ago, it was pointed out. Gen. 1
Carranza's note urging that American 11
troops be withdrawn from Mexico, received
one month ago today, remains
unanswered.
Will Keep Troops in Mexico. '

President Wilson is still determined. It
is said, to carry out his original inten- 0
Lions of keeping American troops In C
Mexico until the bandit bands are com- 1
;?letely broken up and danger of raids on 1
American border communities is past.
The stumbling block at El Paso ap- a
pears to, have been the determination of f
Jen. Carranza to have ah early date set e
oy which all American troops would* be
withdrawn from Mexico. In every communication
or published utterance of the *
first chief he has dealt on the necessity of ^
jetting the troops off Mexican soil if unfortunate
incidents, such as that at Par;al,
are to be avoided. a
The only reply to Gen. Obregon's ar- 1
jjuments that Gen. Scott has been au- d
ihorized to make, so far as known, was w
hat the troops would be withdrawn as t<
soon as the de facto government had e
iemonstrated Its ability to protect the d
aorder from raids. Just what physical h
facts would be required to constitute b
that demonstration is not known, al- c
though it is apparent that the assur- ci
ince of the Mexican officials that they e
vere able to handle the situaton was b
not regarded as sufficient. .ri

EL PASO, Tex., May 12.?Acting no

... Scott, chief of staff of the United
States Army, and Gen. Frederick Fun?ton.
commanding the Southern Delartment.
will leave at 10:30 tonight,
ien. Scott will go to Washington with)ut
delay and Gen. Funston to San_Anonio
to direct the mobilization of miitia
and regular troops that have been
ordered to the border. Gen. Obregon
started south before daybreak.
By the transfer of the questions they
lave been debating for two weeks with
ien. Obregon, Mexican minister of war.
-o diplomatic channels, Gen. Scott and
}en. Funston now are concerned only
vith the military aspect of the situa:ion.
Gen. Funston was in communication
vith Gen. Pershing and Col. Frederick
tV. Sibley, commanding the forces neat
3oquillas, today, but it was understood
that neither the heavy column in Chinuahua
nor the small force stretched
across the border into Coahuila would
issume aggressive attitudes at present.
Unless action is forced by the Mexicans,
the American army probably will
make no forward move while negotiations
between Washington and Mexico
City are being conducted. Active preparations
along the Arizona-New Mexico-Texas
border will be made, how?ver,
and Gen. Funston expects to
strengthen all points that might be objectives
of raiding parties. The fresh regjlar
troops will be distributed along the
oorder almost immediately after thenarrival
at their temporary stations, but
some time will pans before the militia
will be utilized. The guardsmen from
he three states are being mobilized
it Douglas, Columbus and San Antonio,
where they will be mustered into servee
and drilled for field service.

COLUMBUS, N. M., May 12.?Reports
jnverified at military headquarters
:hat American troops arc being withirawn
from San Antonio, Mexico, and
jther advanced bases, gave rise today
:o a belief in some quarters that developments
look toward a protective
>atrol of northern Chihuahua.
Supporting this contention is the
transportation of supplies which had
aeen concentrated at San Antonio back
seventy miles to Xamiquipa. It is
<nown also that Con. Frederick Funston
has expressed his belief that, the
aresent line of rommuiiication is too
one to be maintained properly.
Final arrangements for the concentration
of the New Mexico National
Juard were completed here today. The
Irst companies probably will arrive
from Deming and Silver city before
light. With the announcement that
the militia is to be brought to war

Tames Walsh, chief of ordnance of the

Whole Situation Where It Was.
The situation is almost exactly where
t stood before the conferences began,
"he Mexican government still insists
-n the withdrawal of Gen. Pershing's
olumns upon a certain date and want.4
hat date to come quickly. It is known
hat Gen. Obregon has been willing to
nake concessions in order to reach an
greement with the American conerees.
He has been overruled, howver.
by the first chief, Venustiano Caranza,
and his advisers. After pracically
conceding the demands of the
mierican conferees he was compelled
a reverse his attitude.
