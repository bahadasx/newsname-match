JUDGE GIVES RULES OF CONDUCT
Noted English Suffragist, on
Tour, Will Speak to Co
lumbians May 18.
NO LONGER MILITANT
Visitor Will Tell Why the
Perils of War Caused
End of Movement.
Mrs. Emmeline l'ankhur.st, the Kng-li-.li
suffrage leader, will lecture at the
Columbia Theater at 4 o'clock Thurs
daj afternoon. .May 18.
Mr.-, l'ankhur.st is perhaps betttr
known in her former role, that of
militant suffragette, for she was eon
stan'ly at odds with the Ilritish gov
ernment. She led in window -breaking
and brick-throwing, and when she
. was put in jail she invariably wmt on
hunger strikes.
At the outbreak of the war in Au
gust, l'JH, Mrs. Pankhurst Immediate
ly stopped all the militant political
agitation of the Women's Social and
Political I'nion, and in return the gov-
vernment released unconditionally all
suffragettes who were in prison.
Since then she has deoted her elo
quence to urging patijotic national
s. nice upon men and women. She
has held large recruiting meetings
all over Great ltrilaLu and has been
successful in persuading thousands
of men to enlist.
On .Inly 17, 191.', she organized in
London and headed a procession of
."iO.OOO women eager to sene the gov
ernment. This was sympathetically
received by Lloyd George. As a con
sequence thousands of Urilish women
are now employed in assisting the
government.
Mrs. Pankhurst came to this coun
ty several months ago to assist M.
Mijatovich, the former Serbian minis
ter of foreign affairs, in pleading for
financial help to save Serbia from ex
tinction. Since April 15, she has been
lecturing on suffrage in eastern col
leges and universities. Sirs. Pank
hurst, though she has alwas been I lie
strongest advocate of militant meth
ods in England, has never thought
that American women could profit by
the example of their British sisters,
whose conditions are so different.
Mrs. Pankhurst will come here
from Grinnell, la , and will go from
here to Denver, ending her tour on
the Pacific Coast. Her lectures here
will be on "Why Dritish Women Were
Militant Ilefore the Great War and
After War Was Declared Became
' Reconciled to the Government."
Among the patrons and patronesses
for the lecture are: Mrs. W. II. Willis,
Dean and Mrs. Eldon R. James, Dean
and Mrs. Walter Williams, Dr. and
Mrs. Woodson Moss, Miss Kva John
ston, Dean and Mrs. Walter Miller.
Dr. J. W. Hudson, Mrs. Maude Rad
ford Warren, Prof, and Mrs. F. F.
Stephens, Miss Iouise Xardin, Prof,
and Mrs. Jesse Wrench, Prof. Manley
0. Hudson, Miss Ella Dobbs, Mrs. W.
E. Harshe, Mr. and Mrs. D. A. Rob
nett, Mrs. H. F. SHI, Mrs. L. L. Ber
nard, Prof. Chester Murray, Dr. and
Mrs. Walter McNab Miller, Dr. and
Mrs. W. G. Brown, Mrs. H. J. Daven

Alice Radford, President A. Ross Hill
of the University and President J. M.
Wood of Stephens College.
Advice to 18-Year-Old Hoy Accom
panics Parole.
"The judge is going to lecture."
As soon as this sentence reached the
ears of the attornejs smoking in the
anteroom of the circuit court room
today, cigars and papers were laid
away and the crowd took seats near
the bar.
"Bad company was the cause of
vour downfall," began the judge, ad
dressing his remarks to Roy Reese.
18 years old, who was sentenced to
two years in the state penitentiary for
larceny. "You got in the wrong
crowd and followed their footsteps to
ruin.
"But I believe that you are a good
boy. I believe that jou will make
good if jou are given a fair chance.
So I will parole you on these condi
tions:
"Vou must quit drinking. Drink has
caused the downfall of many a man.
"Vou must not gamble, for gam
bling will lead you to worse things.
"Vou must not associate with Idle
or vicious persons. These persons
led to jour coming into this court.
"Vou must obtain honest labor at
once.
"Now, Roy get a different view of
life when you go to Hiram Phillips
ine was paroled to Mr. Phillips, a
civil engineer in St. Louis). Mr. Phil
lips is a friend of your mother's and
believes in jou. Show him you can
make good.
"Always associate with people a lit
tle better than jou are for they will
pull j-ou up. A bad crowd will alwajs
pull you down."
With tears in his eyes, Roy thanked
the judge and left for St. Louis.

IIIWO JURY IX 1IRVDF0KI) CASE
Senator Walker Still Unconscious.
This afternoon there had been no
change in the condition of former
Senator Charles J. Walker, who suf
fered a paralytic stroke Tuesday
morning. He Is unconscious at his
home on Turner avenue.
"All Moon of My Delight that knows
no wane," sad is the fate that now
awaits thee. Yes, the fate that threat
ens ninety-six pints, forty-eight
quarts and some odd gallons of the
cup that cheers, and does inebriate, is
enough to make th? permanently
pickled old Omar Khayyam burst his
cerements and scourge the Columbia
exponents of law and order from the
halls of justice. It was confiscated
b the enterprising police at Moore's
Switch last Tuesday morning and is
still held at the City Hall. It was be
ing toted Into Columbia by some ne
groes, who claimed it was for home
consumption, but the police were sus
picious.
Down tlu sink! Oh no! Well, into
the cinder pile, then, that old cinder
pile beside the county jail that has
been irrigated with at least fitty gal
lons of whisky in the last two years!
Ninety-six- pints of lvvis Hunter
whisky, bonded in 1911, bottled in
191C, to go down the sink with the
dishwater at the county jail! The
three and a half gallons in big flasks
which repose under the desk of the
chief of police, have no family tree,
and their fate is not a matter of so
much concern as that of the aristo
cratic pints.
"This," said the chief as he held to
the light a long, slim bottle of gol
den Scuppernong, "makes a very nice
drink cold."
Yes? There are twin Scuppernongs,
and they are flaked by a quart bot
tle of blackberry cordial do you re
member that little rhjme about "A
little peach in the orchard grew, boo
hoo?" Well, blackberry cordial comes
next.
The netks of two quart bottles of
beer peep roguishly through a hole
in a gunnjsack and nod a constant
invitation to the stoical chief, who
Keeps his back turned. They are part
or forty-eight bottles of beer which
were made to look like potatoes in a
sack instead of beer in cases.
Tile chief says there is no tempta
tion in the pints, but the beer well,
the dajs are hot. He wishes it were
out of the way, as two pints have been
broken and smell aloud to high
heaven.
Whisky has many use. It is seme
times fed to lapdogs tj gtu.it the'r
grov.th. it may be burned in chating
dishes, and it looks well afira on plum
puddings. Beer Is not so versatile. It
is sometimes taken on fishing trips
and niaideiis use it on their hair to
cause a luxuriant growth.
Cnable to Agree After Kelng Out Two
And a Half Dajs.

Conch Tells of Girls' Infliielirc
on Men.
".My knees are shaking! I'm afraid
of girls!" said II. K. Schulte, foot
ball and track toath at the Univer
sity, as he addressed a meeting of
the Young Women's Christian Asso
ciation last night. "If I were talking
to my football squad, it would be easy,
but girls scare me to death."
The big coach stood in a Read Hall
parlor completely surrounded by girls
and talked to them on "Girls' Influ
ence." ".Many men have been kept out of
school activities because the girls
have been in the way," he said. "Girls
in this school. Individually and col
lectively, have a great influence on
the boys. University training is sup
posed to give bojs and girls a broad
ened view of life, but it cannot do so
if they lead each other to keep out
of school activities. A girl who
keeps a man out of University activi
ties not onlj- is hurting herself but is
narrowing the man in whom she is
interested. The boy in athletics has
certain requirements to follow. The
girl chumming with htm can help him
lo fulfill these."
