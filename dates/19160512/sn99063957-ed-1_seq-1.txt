MAKES CARRANZA BALK
Conferees Failed to. Agree and Passed Settlement Up to
Their Respective Governments Obregon Showed Cause
of Carranza's Ret I In Statement "Had He Accepted
the American Agn "p- ent I Would Have Been a Dead
! Cock In the PifS rould His Chief
8f By t, T. Conkle,
((United Pres. e.aff Correspondent.)
El Paso, Texas, May The Mexican situation re
verted to Washington today following the failure of
negotiations between General Hugh Scott and General
Alvaro Obregon.
Provisional President Carranza's veto of the tentative
agreement governing the occupation of Mexican territory
by American troops and steadfast demand for a time limit
on the stay of the American expedition split the confer
ence. Scott was powerless, to accept the time limit propo
sition, and,failing to find a satisfactory compromise, the
conferees passed the job along to the diplomatic forces.
Carranza diplomats are reported en route to Washington
with instructions to negotiate on the formal request for
an American withdrawal. Action on this request has been
deferred in the hope that the conference at El Paso would
obviate the necessity of pressing it.
General Obregon admitted that he erred in accepting
the tentative agreement and stood pat on Carranza's de
mands in the final session.
"Carranza saved me from myself," Obregon told a
friend. "He knows I'm a fool. Had he accepted the
American agreement I would have been a dead cock in
the pit."
Reviewing the developments during the two weeks
of, conferences officials found that both the United States
and Mexican armies had been greatly strengthened. More
than 12,000 Americans were added to the forces of this
nation, and the line of the expedition was contracted.
Scott expects to remain in El Paso for several days.
General Funston hopes to be able to go to San Antonio
immediately. Militia mobilization there requires his at
tention; Both conferees insisted that there -is still a
prospect of an amicable settlement. ' They announced the
failure to agree on little slips of paper saying that nego
tiations had been referred to Washington.

Washington, May VI. With the bor

Hugh Scott ordered home, the admin-j.-tiation

d- facto government the burden of
further negotiations regarding the pres
ence of 1'nited States troops in Mex

tion at length. No reply to General
Carranza's withdrawal request is ex
pected until Ambassador Designate Ar
Tcdondo asks for it. Then the United
States will answer thaf the expedition
will not he withdrawn until the bor

The Army Will Stay
A situntion more serious than at any
time ' Mince tin Amertie.in expedition
entered Mexico confronted the admin
istration today as a result of failure
of the border conference between Gen
eral Hugh Scott and General Alvaro
Obregon.
Secretary of War Baker directed
Scott to return to Washington nud
Funston to return to San Antonio nt
his own discretion. The administra
tion's next step is Conjectural. It is
feired that Mexicans will get the idea
that refusal to withdraw means an in
tention to do other than merely break
up bandit bands.
The authorities believe there is no
way of diverting Canauza from his in
sistence on a withdrawal, thoutfh they
hiire he will be passive in that demand,
f'.iilure of the conference does not
make continuance of the" expedieion 's
onerntions impossible. It is hoped that
Mexico will take the situation calmly
as it has done in the past.
Secretary of War Baker's announce
ment with regard to the border con
ferences said that both sides earnestly
sought nn agreement, but tint inas
much as thev failed, thev left the mat
ter to the diplomatic departments of
t lie United States and Mexico. It was
understood that General Obregon fear
ed the politick prestige of himself and
Carranza would sutler if border con
ferences were continued.
As the American border patrol st inrts
at present army men renrd it as suf
ficient. Xo orders for further militia
movements are contemplated, it was
said unless border conditions become
more menacing.

ALL HOPE IS GONE
Those Patrolling Sea Where
Roanoke Sank Find No
- More Boats
THINK ALL SWAMPED
IN GALE THAT RAGED
Three Who Drifted Ashore In
Boat With Five Dead Sole
Survivors
San Francisco, May 12. All hope
that, as time passed, the extent of the
North Facifie liner Roanoke disaster
might be lessened was practically aban
doned today when boats which patrolled
the sccno of the wreck hunting for sur
vivors returned with reports that they
had seen no indication even of floating
wreckage..
It is evident that the only survivors
of the wre '.k aro Quurtermaster Elb and
two Mexican firemen who drifted
ashore in a lifeboat with five corpses.
The United States destroyers Hull
and Truxton are searching the wntors
which suddenly swallowed up the his
toric old coasting steamer looking for
bodies of some of the 50 souls that went
to death with the ship. Ffty men nre
keeping watcJi along the San I.nis Ob
ispo coast, expecting that bodies may
wash ashore.
Quartermaster F.lb's description of
the disaster, supplemented by the stor
ies of the Mexicans, is all the gov
ernment will ltavo to go on in its in
vestigation of the wreck. Kib declares
that the vessel began listing at 2:."0 p.;
in., Tuesday1, and t"ut. Captain Richard
Dickson clung to .the sloping bridge
directing the lowering of lifeboats
from one side of the liner. Those on
the other side were useless on account
of the sharp list. Some of the lifeboats
were dropped from the davits stern first
and their occupnnts hurled into the wa
ter to drown. F.lb believes that the can
tain went down with his ship when it
turned turtle.
Several theories for the wreck have
been advanced. A suggestion that the
Roanoke struck a submerged derelict
or unchartered reef, or that a time
bomb placed among- the tolls of dyna
mite in its hold exploded and ripped a
hole under the water line is not taken
seriously. It is generally believed that
the disaster was caused by the cargo
shifting while the Roanoke rolled iu a
heavy sea.
The three survivors will be brought
to San Francisco as soon as they are
able to be moved and will be requested
to testify nt the government probe.
Searching for Boats.
San Diego, Cab, Mny 12. The tor
pedo bout destroyers Hull, Truxton and
Hopkins today ure steaming northward
to search the seas for boats from the
fouudered steamer Roanoke, which went
down off Port Snn Luis. The destroy
ers nre equipped with powerful search
lights which, will be ieit in a search nt
night.
Elb Tells More Details.
Snn Luis Obispo, Cnl., May 12. At
torney C. If. Sooey, of (he North Pacific
line, arrived here today to Investigate
a theory that the steamer Roanoke dis
aster wus caused by a time bomb being
placed in the dynamite cargo when it
was transferred from the ships which
brought it from the Pugct Sound to
the Roanoke in port here. Sooey would
not divulge the grounds upon which he
based this suspicion, but lie declared lie
intended to interrogate the three sur
vivors careful'y concerning it.
The survivors, Quartermaster Fib
and two Mexican firemen, are apparent
ly recovering from the effects of their
terrible experience today. F.lb today
added a number of details to his ac
count of the wreck, u'nief among them
being a graphic description of how-
Carlos Bclgrnno, Oaklund high school
boy, who hud shipped as freight clerk,
came to his end.
Kib said that Bclgrnno wns in the
lifeboat with him when it wns capsized.
Both were plunged into the sea and
grasped planks. Together they attempt
ed to keep afloat and rench another
boat. Lib said thnt Belgrann got a
slippery board and lost his hold on it
repeatedly, always, however, swimming
for a moment and then again grabbing
his support.
Finally, however, when another life
boat was approaching thmngh the
heavy sea, the Oakland bov was over
whelmed by a big wave ftnd his frantic
grip on the plunk was torn loose for
th.i Inst time. Bclgrnno swam desper
ately for a moment, trying to keep his
head above water until the lifeboat
came up, but he disnppared under an
other wave while rescuers wore extend
ing their hands to bfm. Kill never saw
him again.
Watchers along the bench, up to nnou.
had been unable to discover nuy traces
of survivor or bodies of victims. The
patrol is being mnintnined, however,
in the belief that corpses will drift
1 ashore.
$75,000 Worth of
Liquors Seized
Seattle, Wrash., May 12. Forty po

Teddy Sees Expediency In
Root's Speech-Wood
Boomlet Is Born
New York, May 12. Supporters of
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt today saw
expediency in Elihu Root's Red Cross
speech in which he announced for pre
paredness. Among other political items gleaned
today was the fuct that John Stewart,
who is fathering the General Leonard
Wood movement, announced ho would
soon issue a statement of the republi
can party's st.ite of mind on Wood.
The Hughes boom, which has been
without headquarters because he
frowns on tho use of his name, was re
vived with rumors that Hughes is now
more conciliatory since he received let
ters from all parts of tho nation urg
ing hira to becomo a presidential can
didate.
The Roosevelt advertisement in a
weekly mag.izine, it wns pointed out,
wns an appeal in a new direction,1
since it is a bid for pence advocates'
votes, lauding Roosevelt ns a peace
maker. Says Their Relations

Government Halts Courts
Martial of Rebel Leaders
to Allay Feeling
London, Mav 12. Premier Asquith,
upon arriving today in Dublin to take
hnrgc or a situation which is admitted
ly growing more serious, immediately
ordered postponement of courtfl-mnrtial
of rebel leaders pending the outcome
ot his conferences with officials.
He met General Sir John Maxwell,
officers of the British army and civil
authorities, and urged Maxwell to
speedily inquire into the shooting of
Editor Skeffington without trial, which
act aroused Ireland's deepest indigna
tion. Several thousard -otters nrotestinir
against further executions of rebel lead
ers have reached Asquith. Many urged
the government not to scatter the spark
of a new revolt by severo repressive
measures.
Whilo agreeing with critics of the
government's policy that the killing of
Skeffington was atrocious, Asquith ap
proves the execution of the 14 rebel
lenders who have faced- firing squads.
He intimated that S. Melmirmnd and
Knmon Oenunt, both of whom signed
the Irish proclamation of independence,
will receive the death penalty. Jnmes
Connolly, general of the Irish rebel
army is wounded ana in prison aud
will probably be executed.
JSewspnpers have differences of opin
ion as to whether Asquith would at
tempt to establish a measure of home
rule in Ireland on his present visit. All
expressed hope of finding a way to con
ciliate hostile Ireland.
Indian Rebels Also Executed.
