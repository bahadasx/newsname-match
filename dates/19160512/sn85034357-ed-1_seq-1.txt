The controversy between the Nor?

hold against the company.

THE HUDSON SUPER SIX.
Test Here Shows Consumption of A
Gallons of Fuel to 100 Miles.
Mr. Jo. Walton, connected with the
Virginia Motor Car Company, of Roa
noke, was here this week in confer?
ence with the Star Motor Company.
Mr. Walton is the son of Mr. and
Mrs. A. D. W. Walton, formerly of
Tnzewell and his visit here was wel?
comed and enjoyed by many friends
and relatives of his mother, a sister
of B. W. Stras, of this city.
The Virginia Motor Car Company
handle the Hudson and Dodge Bros,
cars exclusively. Mr. Walton said
that rival dealers have been busy
"knocking" the Hudson cars, the new
Super Six particularly, among other
things, that the Hudson Super Six is
extravegantly expensive in the mat?
ter of fuel, fairly drinking gasoline
at a prohibitive rate. A demonstra?
tion given here flatly contradicts this
charge, it seems.
On Tuesday morning a party of
six, viz: the editors of the two town
papers, William Gillespie, L. A.
Tvnes and Byrd Chapman, with Mr.
Walton at the wheel, took n spin in
the Super Six, as far as to Gratton
and return, a distance of \2Vi miles,
using on the entire trip only one-half
gallon of gasoline, which means four
gallons per hundred miles. This test
was accurately made?no guess work.
This is cheap riding so far as fuel
is concerned, and contradicts flatly
the charge that the machine requires
an excessive amount of gasoline. This
writer knows little about cars gener?
ally, but so far as he is able to judge,
the Hudson Super Six seems to stand
near the top of its class.

Pocahontas, May 10.?Pocahontas is
I making a bid for business. Arrange?
ments were made by the Business
Men's Association to send out a boos?
ter's squad through the West Vir?
ginia coal filods. All available auto?
mobiles were pressed into service and
the business men are using them to
the fullest extent in advertising the
business firms of the town,
j Starting on Thursday and contin?
uing through Friday, they covered
a large territory, which they believe
will bring results in the way of trade.
The use of the automobiles were given
free by the owners, and several ladies
made the trip on Thursday. Souven
I irs, circulars, and other kinds of nd
I vertising matter were distributed and
the automobiles carried signs boosting
Pocahontas.

day in Pocahontas. Mayor Ellelt, in
I conjunction with the Civic League,
had posted notices calling upon all cit?
izens to clean up around their premis?

provement in the appearance of the
i town.

j went out May 1. Tho crowds are
smaller and the town is quiet. Hut
three or four arrests reported and
none jailed.

old son of R. E. Burton, wdio lives on

ground. Two logs had come togeth?
er and in extricating one tho other
was dislodged and he was caught un?
derneath both, one log on his breast
and part of his head and the other
on his leg, where he remained helpless
from about 10 o'clock until his mother
became alarmed wdiea he did not come
for his dinner on time aad wont to
look for him. She heard his cries,
which by that time, were becoming
verv weak, and soon found him, but
had to send for his father before she
could extricate him. Dr. Alexander
was sent for and gave the boy atten?
tion, and it is thought that he will
recover.

NEW 'JUICE' TO
RUN YOUR CAR
New York Man lias Made Won?
derful Discovery?"Gasoline"
to He Made at Cent and a
Half a Gallon.
That the high price of gasoline is
soon to be lowered, seems a fore?
gone, on account of a recent discov?
ery by a New York chemist. The
following npoared in the New York
papers recently regarding the discov?
ery:
New York May 11.?Louis Enrich
has sohl his secret formula of his
penny and a half a gallon gasoline
substitute for gasoline for $2,000,
000.
Enrichl's neighbors in the little vil?
lage of Fnrnniigdiile, down on Long
Island thought Enrich! dreaming when
he claimed he could operate an auto
mobile with a mysterious green liquid
he Invented.
Hut the Maxim Munition Company
figured the formula so good it. has
agreed to pay $1,000,000 in cash and
$1 (KiO.tKH) in slock to the inventor.
The process of manufacture, nc
cording to Enrichl, is very simple.
Pour ounces of a strange chemical
mixture, green in color, is stirred into
live gallons of water. The solution
goes into the auto's tank and the
auto runs just as it would if fed with
gasoline.
Henry Ford visited the inventor,
who is seventy, and he came away
convinced that Knrichl.'s discovery
was genuine, it. is said.
The cost of manufacturing the
liquid is about one and a half cents
per gallon.
Here is as much of an explanation
of his invention us Enrichl is willing
to make: The addition of his "green
mystery" to the water in the "gas"
lank of an auto releases the hydrogen
gas in the water. The hydrogen pass?
es into tho carbureter, where it comes
into contact with tho nitrogen of the
air, taken into the engine through
the air intake pipe. The explosive en?
ergy to drive the engine is the result
of this combination.
.lust after he announced his discov?
ery Enricht. stopped making his fluid
because, he said, he didn't dare to go
to drug Btorcs to buy Ingredients,
"1 can't go anywhere without bcillK
followed by detectives working for the
>il companies," he said.
Maxim company officials say they
will produce a substitute that will be
used by every auto owner and kneel;
he bottom out of the high price of
gasoline.

BUYING A CAR?
The ear that the automobile association statistics
show has the smallest upkeep of any on the market.
The ear built by the oldest manufacturer and next
to the strongest financial (inn in the business. The one
that had the foresight and the cash to buy on a low
market, and this is why we can give you a car that
has no superior under $'2,000 anil at a price that the
average man can ntTord. $1250 for the seven passen?
ger Six. and $875 for the famous REt) the FIFTH,
f. o. b. Lansing, Mich.
These are only a lew of the advantages of the REO.
Let us show you many more. A card will bring our
representative.
