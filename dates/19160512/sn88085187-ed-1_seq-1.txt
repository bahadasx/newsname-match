early Thursday morning—fat,

well nigh crazy physicians back
in the Empire stste.
Three weeks ago his doctors
bundled Woolworth onto n Ten
nessee-bound train for Tait's
Springs willi strict orders to re
main quiet for a month, forget
business and give his nerves a
rest.
Arriving at the health resort,
Woolworth didn't like the looks
of the place, so he skedaddled.
Meanwhile the doctors don't
know where he's gone, and are
wringing their hands in a frenzy,
sending telegrams all over the
Country and raising professional

That's the kind of a fellow
