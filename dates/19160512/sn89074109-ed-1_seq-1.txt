Beach is to Have
Day Service
After Improvements in Plant Ex
tending Over Nearly a Year,
Service will Start
May 15.
The long projected day electric
service, Which has been eagerly
awaited By Beach citizens for sev
eral months, will become a reali
ty Monday next, when for the first
time the juice will be turned on
for a continuous day and night
service. Improvements to this
end have been going on at the lo
cal plant of the Beach Electric
Co. since early last fall, and in
volved extensive alterations in
the company's equipment and the
installation of powerful new ma
chinery.
The new service was preceeded
several months ago by night ser-.
vice for Sentinel Butte, which
will now be supplied with contin
uous service the same as Beach.
The announcement by officials of
the local plant is eagerly wel
comed by Beach citizens, and fills
a want which has been.manifested
for some time.
The work has been in charge of
resident manager Hugh Hamilton
and H. A. Robertson, both finan
cially interested in the concern,
and though alterations will con
tinue for some time, a steady ser
vice, except during the daylight
hours of Sunday, is promised.
A new80 h.p. engine and 250 h.p
boiler were installed this winter,
which with the former power
equipment now gives two power
units of 80 and 120 h. p. each. The
smaller engine will be used
during day service, and the lar
ger for night service, or when the
demands for greater power just
ify. A 60 cycle alternating current
will be supplied, with a current of
110 voltage for lighting purposes,
as in the past, sufficient to operate
vacum cleaners and such small
apparatus as require small mo
tors. Where heavier demands for
power occur, a voltage of 220 will
lie supplied, sufficient for the op
eration of heavy machinery.
Extensive changes in the inter
ior of the power plant were neces
sary, aside from those which have
occurred in outside equipment,
among them being a switchboard
of twice the capacity formerly
used to take care of the distribu
tion of power from the new en
gine, as well as the demands made
by the Sentinel Butte line. In or
der to distribute power to Sentin
el Butte, it wras necessary to erect
transformers, one at each end of
the line. The Beach transformer
steps the current up from 2200
volts to 13,000. the Sentinel Butte
end again stepping the current
down to its proper voltage.
The improvements have neces
sitated the expenditure of an im
mense sum of money, in which
the officials feel justified from the
fact that the growth of Beach and
the need for a stable power sup
ply in the various institutions of
the city warrant it, the present
price of gasoline being almost
prohibitive for power purposes.
Already a large number of power
•users have signified their inten
tion to install motors to supplant
gasoline engines, among them the
Chronicle, which hopes in the
near future to have individual
motors for all its machinery.
Mrs. Byron Dilley left last week
for Rochester, Minn., where she
•will take treatment at the famous
Mayo Bros, hospital. Mrs. Dilley
has not been feeling well for
some time, and her many friends
hope her trip will result in an
early and complete recovery.
Rev. W. T. Kessinger was
Glendive visitor this week.
BEACH DEFEATED BY
GLENDIVE SUNDAY.
The Beach baseball team open
ed the season at Glendive last
Sunday afternoon making the
trip in autos against one of the
highest winds of the season. The
wind blew a teriffic gale, and the
batting eyes of the ball tossers
were filled with sand, making it
a strenuous trip. The team arriv
ed in the Gate City about 1:30,
ate their dinner, dressed and was
at the grounds for battle at 3:15.
O. C. Griffith, formerly of Beach,
was selected to umpire.
Phil Paulson went to the mound
for the locals, while the Indian,
Chase, went in the box for the
Glendive team. Vincent playing
second for the Beach team very
cleverly knocked the ball through
the centerfielders' leg on his first
trip to the plate. Mulligan did
the receiving for the visitors.
Paulson was a little wild, but
when he did get them over, the
Glendive batsman were unable to
connect twelve of them going
out on strikes in the six innings
that he was on the mound. The
home team were continually yelp
ing as they were called out on
strikes. The curves of the young
Beach pitcher seemed to have
them puzzled at all times although
one of the home boys did crash
one over centerfielder's head for
a clean homer. The Beach boys
outfielded and outhattcd the Glen
dive boys and but for the wildness
of their pitcher, the score would
have been reversed. Armentrout
pitched the last two innings and
very easily kept the home boys
from scoring. Our team looks
good, and will give a good account
of itself against any of the teams
during the coming season.

Beach Ueber Alles
Says Exchange
Gives Us Publicity in Commenting
Upon Enlistment by Sever
al Beach Youths.
The following news item ap
peared in a recent issue of the
Sioux iCty (la.) Tribune, and was
occasioned by the recent enlist
ment of several Beach young men
at the Sioux City recruiting sta
tion:
There is a patriotic little town
up in North Dakota called
Beach. It could be depended up
on for many recruits for Uncle
Sam in case of a call to arms,
according to Sergeant Charles
Butler, who is in charge of the
recruiting station in Sioux City.
One of the first men to enlist
at the local station after it re
opened was John Maher, of
Beach. Yesterday Guy Ward,
of Beach, the same town, enlist
ed, anil last night he was sent to
Fort Logan. Sergeant Butler
declared that many letters have
been received recently from
young men in Beach, inquiring
about enlistment. The writers
expressed eagerness to be ad
milted to the army.
Ward, the recruit who enlist
ed yesterday, said that several
men intend to come to Sioux
City to take the entrance ex
aminations as soon as possible.
Considering the distance from
Beach toSioux City and the rail
road fare required, the interest
taken by citizens there is unu
sual, said Sergeant Butler.
Johnny Maher, more familiarly
known to his Beach friends as
"Joe", is the son of "Micky"
Maher, until recently an efficient
member of the Beach police force,
and comes of a family noted for
their active service to our Uncle
Samuel. Mr. Maher was recently
retired after a continuous service
of thirty years as a member of the
regular army, and is the proud
possessor of seven honorable dis
charges, in army parlance known
as "clean bills of health". Mr. Ma
her's army record was exception
al, and elicited correspondence
from the department commending
him upon his record. An uncle,
J. W. McNiece, formerly chief of
police, served in the grand army
bf the Republic in the civil war,
and later several "hitches" in the
regular army. In the light of his
family's army record, it is per
fectly natural that Joe should
evince a similar desire to serve
his country.
Guy Ward, is the son of G. E.
Ward, formerly of Sentinel Butte,
who until recently was proprie
tor of the local pool hall. His de
parture from Beach revealed a
wake of bogus checks, but his
whereabouts until revealed by the
a a as re a in
known. It is thought, however,
that the young fellow became ob
sessed with the craze to join in
the hunt for Villa and not realis
ing the seriousness of his step,
evolved the simple means of
affixing his name to sundry
bits of bogus worthless paper
to replenish a depleted exechepur.
In view of that fact, it is possible
that nothing will be done to bring
him back for trial.
M. P. Lovgrcn of Wheaton,
Minn., who has been a guest for
a couple of days of Dr. Lloyd
Erickson, left Sunday afternoon
for Beach, where he has purchas
ed a jewelry store and will enter
business tliere.-Mandan Pioneer.
R. H. West, who has been in
the vicinity for several days look
ing over Golden Valley land with
a view to investing, returned last
week to his home at Braddock.

UNITED STATES MAKES
TELEGRAPH WAR TEST.
All wireless, telegraph and tel
ephone facilities of the United
Slates were placed at the disposal
of the navy department Sunday,
the anniversary of the sinking of
the Lusitana, for a mammoth war
test, which look place from four
o'clock that afternoon until Mon
day morning.
This plan had been officially
announced as a test of the
country's wireless facilities in the
possible evenl of war, and was an
experiment to demonstrate prac
tically what could be expected
from the country's communica
tion facilities on short notice. No
preparation, beyond the instal
lation of apparatus at the navy
department and llie addition of a
corps of operators, took place.
"It was an undertaking never
before attenmpled by any coun
try," said anager Wm. Kiddle of
the Western Union to a Chronicle
representative, 'and the result
should what a reinforcement to
the nation's facilities the tele
graph, telephone and wireless
•service could become in the sud
den breaking out of v.ar. Battle
ships were maneuvered miles
from land, following instructions
il Washington. Chief's of bur
eaus having to do with defense
problems and their execution in
lime of war carried on all busi
ness willi1. the department tele
phone. A special switchboard
was installed in the navy depart
nienl, and from it wires led to the
offices of the secretary and bur
eau chiefs. From these branches
direct communication was had
Kvith any point in the United
States and with battleships far
out at sea."
The wires in the test used for
telephonic communication were
connected with telegraph instru
ments, and telegrams and tele
phone messages were sent over
them at the same time.
The test was a splendid suc
cess, and though for the most
pari Beach people were unaware
of what was going on, as the tests
were conducted more or less pri
vately, they will be interested to
know lliat coast lo coast com
munication, conducted on the
same basis that would be the
case in the event of war, passed

partment.
SADDLE BUTTE SCHOOL
CONDUCTED EXERCISES.
A very interesting and timely
program occurred at the Brown
school in Saddle Butte on the
evening of April 29. Although the
school had an enrollment of but
eight pupils, they proved them
selves more than equal to a large
enrollment in their capacity to
handle the various characters in
volved in presenting the excellent
program. Great credit is due the
teacher, Mrs. Shawn Kelly, who
will be remembered as Miss Myr
tle Price prior to her recent mar
riage, who exercised considerable
time and patience in training the
pupils for the occasion. Her two
years' work in the district has
been most successful, and though
(lie community has lost her as a
teacher, they are pleased to learn
that she will continue her resi
dence in the neighborhood.
O. S. Bartholomew, who has
been in the employe of the Beach
Electric Co., and who left several
weeks ago for Thermopolis
Wyo., where he took a course of
treatment at the sulphur hot
springs, returned Sunday after
noon, much improved. He has
resumed his duties at the power
plant.
Silk Extra Passes
Through Beach
Carried Consignment Valued at
Nearly Two Millions,
From Orient to
New Jersey.
A special train of six cars, load
ed with raw silk to the value of
almost two millions of dollars,
pased through Beach Saturday
afternoon. Each car had a value
of .$325,000.
The consignment had right-of
wa over all trains on the North
ern Pacific, not excepting crack
passenger train No. 2. It left
Glendive at 4:00 p. m.. arriving
at Beach at 5:20 and at Dickinson
at 7:25, from where after but a
few minute's stop it continued on
its way east.
The train was taken in charge
by the N. P. at Seattle, and is a
special consignment originating
in the Orient. Its destination is
Patterson, N. J„ and a high speed
schedule is being maintained
across the continent. The freight
rale on each car is $3,000, or *18,
000 for the train, and the precious
cargo is in charge of special de
tectives and guards to prevent a
repetition on the famous silk
theft which occurred on another
line in this slate some years ago,
and which involved a car of the
goods.
It is not known here whether
the consigmcnt has any signifi
cance bearing upon was muni
tions and supply shipments to
Europe. Engine No. 2183, recent
ly placed in service after being
nearly incinerated in the Dickin
son round house fire a month ago,
hauled the train ovei- this divi
sion. As proving the speed with
which the train was being taken
care of over the N. P. line, it is
understood that the silk train
passed No. 2 before the latter
reached Fargo, although there
was a difference of five hours be
tween the arrival of the two trains
in Beach.
FRANK SCHERO DEAD.
Frank Sehero, father of Clar
ence Schero, with whom he had
been making his home for a num
ber of years, passed away Tues
dayal his son's home nine and a
half miles south of Beach, after
a long illness due to the infirmi
ties of age. Mr. Schero, was 80
years of age, and until recently

advanced years. Funeral services
were conducted at the home this
morning by Rev. W. T. Kessinger
of the United Brethren church, an
Hie remains, accompanied by his
son, were shipped east for burial
at his old home. The son has the
sympathy of the community.

BACKWARD SPRING WILL
REDUCE WHEAT ACREAGE
Seeding operations are greatly
behind this year, and is causing
some concern to Golden Valley
farmers, who, however, are not
alone in their fears, the entire
northwest, as well as the vast
iniddlewest corn area, experienc
ing an extremely backward sea
sos.
With May 10 (Wednesday) the
generally accepted dead line for
sowing wheat, and with only a
small percentage of the wheat
acreage seeded, indications are
that the wheal acreage of the
state will be materially reduced
this year. Last year's seeding
operations were far earlier than
this year's, when in the southern
part of the slate seeding opera
tions were nearly completed.
Golden Valley farmers general
ly have displayed a commendable
effort to prepare their crops with
care. Many, however, who were
confronted with more work than
they could accomplish, due to
weather conditions, have been
forced lo disc in llieir grain.
The lack of fall plowing is a
condition that is especially ser
ious all over the slate, estimates
placing the decrease at nearly
25 per cent.
As a result of the reduced wheat
acreage, there will be a greater
area of oats, flax, barley and such
other grains which can be sown
at a laler dale.
HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS
