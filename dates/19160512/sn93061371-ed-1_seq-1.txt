$10, which occurred only a few

Again the Record finds it
necessary to consign to the
waste basket a contribution
which did not have the writer's
name signed to it. We do not
publish the names of our cor
respondents, but Iri tlo Case will
. i i . . . .
we puousn an article that is
not signed. We are glad ' to
have a good and interesting
correspondent from each part o:
the county, one who will give
the real ne-s of that com
munity, But in each case the
writer must sign his or her
name, Then if it is prefered
by tile writer the hams will be
withheld.
l ne editor frequently finds it
necessary to use the "Blue Pen
cil" pretty freely on some cor.
respondents for the reason that
they insist on giving their
neighbor a "slab"; This" heW
buys the writer any thing, for
all such remarks are cut out and
are never published. If you
have anything to say about
your neighbor, have man enougl
about you to go to him person
ally and say it to his face.
Don't think for a hiihUte that
the Record is going to carry
your insults around to him and
then stand between vou and
the club.

Santa Fo, K M May 4. A
revolting charge is facet! today
in federal court by Emmifc
Ooodin, of Alma, Oklahoma,
who is accused of violating the
whtto slave act by inducing his
o',ti wifij to emtyt a Ufa ot pros-
tituf ioii. The fact that m wifeT
Mr?. Maude Goodin, who v;as im
witness against l lie defend an c
this morning, is not yet 1(1 years
of age and ia rather attractive
in appearance with a girlish
manner, nraUes the cape almost
unparalied in the history of
white slave prosecutions.
Ooothn was indicted about a
month ago by the federal grand
jury which met in ibis city
U. S. District Attorney Hum
mers Knrkhart is representing;
the government and Attorney
William J. tfas-ker, of thii city,
by appointment of the wnrt, is
defending Ooedin, '
There were only a few people
in court when Mrs. OoGtlin took
the W itness stand tins morning.
She testified that she was mar
ried to fkfandant on her fifteen
th birthday, which fell on Sep
tember 11, l!)ly, having had the
consent of her parents, bhts
saidTihe left Alma, Oklahoma,
on the following day, traveling
by team with her husband into
King county, Texas, where a
halt was made to work picking
cotton. She testified that soon
afterward her husband had
induced her to enter a
life of prostitution. The next
witness was J. G. McGhee,
court stenographer, of Rosweif,
who had taken down the testi
mony at the hearing given giv
en Goodin when ho was accus
ed of murdering a man named
Burleson in January of this year,
of 'which charge h? was liter
acquitted. Only a portion of
McGce s testimony wa3 admit
ted.
Tom Calloway of Four Lakes,
N. M., was the third witness.
Ho testified he had seen the
Goodins traveling through th
state and said that Goodin had
solicited him to have improper
relations with Mrs. Goodin.
It in thought that the taking
of testimony will be concluded
this afternoon.
Fred E. Dennis, an official of
the department of justice, is
here from Clovis on the case, ae
he had attended the preliminary
healing given Goodin, at Kc-s-
well.
Later: Goodin was found
guilty by the jury in ten minutes
deliberation and was sentenced
y Judge Pope to four years in
the penitentiary and pay the
expense of the trial.
