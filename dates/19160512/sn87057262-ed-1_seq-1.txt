EL PASO, Texas, May 12.—The
Mexican situation today reverted to
Washington, following the failure of
international negotiations between
War Minister Obregon and General
Scott. General Carranza's veto of the
tentative agreement reached at the
start of the negotiations and bis
steadfast refusal to accede to any
plan not providing a date for with
drawal of the American expedition,
split the conference. Obregon ad
mitted his error In accepting the ten
tative settlement and stood pat on the
demands of the first chief. General
Soott, on the other hand, strove to
hML,upon a scheme to satisfy- the..
Mexican government wttlioutcompro
misingr the American attitude. He was
powerless to accept any agreement
setting a definite limit on the expedi
tion's operations. Failing to find a
satisfactory plan, the conferees gave
up the job and passed it along to the
diplomatic forces of their respective
governments. Carranza diplomats to
day are reported enroute to Washing
ton fully instructed by the first chief
to conduct negotiations there on the
formal request for -withdrawal which
Arredondo presented to the depart
ment. Action on the request was de
ferred temporarily, in the hopes that
the meeting here would obviate for
mal diplomatic negotiations on it.
Obregon delivered no ultimatum. Ac
cording to bis advisors, he simply in
sisted that the united States respect
the sovereignty of Mexico and set a
date beyond which the American
army should remain on Mexican soil.
He wavered once when be accepted
a tentative agreement on behalf of
his administration after a strenuous
twelve hour conference with Scott.
This agreement was a waiver of the
defacto government's principal con
tention—withdrawal. But when Car
ranza vetoed the contract, Obregon
bowed to the order of his chief.
"Carranza has saved me from my
self." he told a friend after the veto.
"He knows I am a food. Had he ac

a consistent conferee in the later

that the Frenoh at one stage of the

of the force* on the east bank.

youthful brother of a girl whom he
attempted to assault, according to
the latest version of the wounding of
the bandit. A former Villista officer
told the Btory here today, asserting
the details came from the girl's fam
ily and ^neighbors.
The boy was beaten to death by
Villa's men at the bandit leader's
ourt command to "kill him."
Villa had long maintained his re
spect for women. Many stories are
told in Mexico of officers executed
by the bandit because they attacked
young girls. Villa forfeited this re
deeming virtue, however, while
marching to attack Columbus, wtoen. he
kidna'ped the twelve year old daughter
of Juan Aider!te, foreman of a big
ranch- at BaehiBeva.'. The girl was
