"From evidence in my possession."

"This is the worst polsonlng plot

ASQUITH GOES
TO IREAND;
POLICY HIT
Shedding of River of
Blood Denounced
by John Dillon.
SYMPATHY FOR
REBELS GROWS
Premier's Departure for
Dublin Viewed as Home
Rule Portent.
London, May 11. Premier Asquith
left l/ondon to-nlght for Dublin tl deal
with a new nnd dangerous factor in the
Irish situation. Since the brief rising
flashed in the pan the possibility that
the punishment of t he rebels would
cause a reartion of sympathy among
warm hearted and emotional people has
been recogmzed. This threatened dan?
ger is now fast matrr.ali7.ing
John Dillon, one of the most respeet?
ed of the Nationalists, but often one
of the bitterest antagoniata of Brit?
ish rule. attacked the government to
dBy in the Hcuse of Commons in a
speech whieh for bitter denuneiation
has not been surpassed at Westminster
since the days of l'arnell.
Premier Anquith hng perionally
stepped into the breach by taking the
unprecedented course of journeying to
Dublin, doubtleas to give instruetlona to
General Sir John Maxwell regarding tho
policy whieh the military government
must purfcue, now that the chief civil
m'-vnlstretors, Lord Wunborne. Au
gustine Birrell and Sir Matthew Na?
than, have retired from office. The
Premier left London to-night by the
Irish mail train.
Mr. Asquith's idea. it is believed, is
to sound Irish opinion on the spot as
to the possibility of a deal or a com?
promise over the Home Rule question,
a deal whieh might include putting into
ifTt'Ct irnrnediately some measure of
Home Rule, coupled, perhaps, with thc
mcluaion of Ireland in the military
compulsion bill.
Aaqulth aa Conciliator.
Mr. Asquith once before took the
reins in his own hands at a crisis by
assuming the Secretaryship of State for
War, when the threatened I'lster revolt
in 1914 caused the resignation of
Colonel Seely.
The Prime Minister's fnest powers
have always been displayed as a con?
ciliator, and he now has ? task whieh
ia likely to demand their utrnost exer
ciae. Ha announced that he was going
to ronsult with the authorities in order
to arrive at some p.rrangemert aatisfae
tory to Irishmen of all parties, and no
?tataaaMM ever attempted a harder
achievement. Ile di.-claimed any pur?
pose af super-seding the executive au?
thority in Ireland. He adnntted that
the present government of ireland was
anomalous and unsatisfactory -nd could
could not continue indefinitely.
Whilo John Dillon'l motion for a fall
atatement of the government'a inten
tions was negatived in the Commons
without a division, the resolution pro?
posed by thc Earl of Loreburn in the
lloiisr of Peers expreaaing dissatisfac
tlon xvith the Cabinet's admlnistration
of Irish affairs was adopted.
Fall Statement Aaked.
The text of the resolution presented
in the House of Commons by John Dil?
lon xxas as follows:
"That m the interests of peace and
good government in Ireland >t ia vitally
important that the government .should
make irnrnediately a full atatement af
Its intontloni as to cont.nuar.ee af Bl
ecut.ons in that country, earried out as
a resul' of secret military trials, and
n ro continuance of mart.al law. mili?
tary rule and the aearches and whole
sale arrests now going on in various
districts of the country."
In proposing his resolution Mr. Dil?
lon referred to the execution of Thomaa
Kent, in County Cork. saying it looked
as though there was a roving commis?
sion to carry out "?hese horrible exe?
cutions." T.'-'iay thfl government an?
nounced thare had been fourteen exe?
cutions, he continued. although the
previous ligure was twelve. He aiked
