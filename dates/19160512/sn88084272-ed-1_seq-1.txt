than a score of informal exchanges be
tween Gens. Scott and Obregon.
Cause of the Split.
The conference split upon the de
mand of Gen. Obregon that the Ameri
can troops be withdrawn from Mexico
at a specified time. Gen. Scott insisted
that the troops would only be with
drawn when the United States was fully
satisfied that the Villa bandits had been
punished for their raid on Columbus, N.
M., and that the de facto government
of Mexico was in a position to prevent
future raids into the United States.
Gen. Obregon insisted that the United
States set a date on which its army
would retire and offered to furnish
sufficient Carranza troops to properly
guard tho Mexican border, suggesting
that American troops keep up their
vigilance on their side of the line, to
doubly protect the border.
Simultaneously with the breaking up
of the conference. Gen. Obregon stated
officially that 5000 Carranza troops
were being moved north from the vi
cinity of Torreon. Zacatecas and Aguas
