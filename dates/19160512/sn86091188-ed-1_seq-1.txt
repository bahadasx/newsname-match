COMMENT.
Bully for BUI Taft.
(N. Y. Evening Post.,
Taft, throughout the variera.
phases or his success ir's ad.ulnistrs
tlon, has shown himself ready to give 1
his moral support to Mr. Witam In!
.iison ini
any undertaking which affected the !
vital concerns of the nation. That
he does not fall io du so In this giav
est ui all ihe situations
,
the country has been confronted^°n
hope that Germany may^rah»,!!™, 0 !!.
these eventful years will surprise
nobody, and hardly calls for cotn
meut. Yet it is well to note that, in
ids speech at Chicago, Mr. Taft,
while expressing his most earnest :
change her j
policy and enable us to continue our j
friendly relations wltn her," de- !
dared that the stand Mr. Wilson ha« !
taken is right, and tlml there is !
nothing for "a clear-headed, patriotic j
American to do but to back our 1
president.
Moral Armor of Roosevelt.
(Lewiston Tribune.)
The popular Impression that the
bosses of the republican party would
prefer to put Justice Hughes Into the
White House rather than Mr. Roose
velt, is true of such leaders as Mr.
Barne« and Senator Penrose, who
have quarreled Irreconcilably with
Mr. Roosevelt. But it is hardly true
of the reputillcan leaders as a whole.
To be sure, all of them understand
that the nomination and election of
Mr. Roosevelt would do much to ini
pair discipline, and with the republi
cans discipline has always been a car
dinal virtue. To reward one wlm
not only deserted, but did all lie
could to destroy the republican par
ty, would only suggest to the ordi
nary disciple of the party that disloy
ally and rebellion were, after all on
ly venial sins; and republican leaders
have I o.desire to inculcate that dis
rupting idea. But aside from this
objection. It is pretty safe to say
that, If reduced to the choice, mo-t
republican leaders would prefer to
have Mr Roosevelt than Justice
Hughes in the While House. They
are afraid uf Justice Hughes lor tlie
reason they have come to know tb*J
he means what he says, whereas ex
perience has shown them abundantly
tnat the frailties and foibles of Mr.
Roosevelt render it easy to penetate
tils moral armor. The politicans haw
learned to discount Mr. Roosevelt,
learned tha< he bilks much and im
pulsively, and therefore says much
that is not. meant to survive the oc- j
casion of Ills spe iking. Tlie late Sen
ator Aldrich always found that Mr.
Roosevelt «vus amenable t i diploma
tic treatment if approached In a wav
tnat testiüed an appreciation of Mr.
RooSevèlt s greatness Of the tw<
men, the average republican
would undoubtedly prêter lo see Mr
Roosevelt in the While House
