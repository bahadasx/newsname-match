Announcement.
Continuing our announcement of last week it occurs
to me that there has been a great improvement in
the drug store service in Ekalaka in the last twelve
months. In the matter of prices our record has been
consistent and notwithstanding the unheard of ad
vance in drugs and chemicals due to the great war
the price of medicine in Ekalaka as a whole, is lower
today that a year ago. It shall continue to be the
policy of this store to divide profits with our custom
ers and to dispense the best in our line. I specialize
on prescription work and the products of our pre
scription department rank with those of the best
pharmacies, east or west.

Richard Miles Adams, born
May 22, 1911 at Belle Fourche S.
Dak..
Afflicted about Feb. 15, 1916
at Virginia City, Montana, where
parents Mr. and Mrs Carl C.
Adams were then residing.
Best medical skill of Murray
Hospital of Butte, Montana was
unable to diagnose the malady
and relief was sought at the
famous Mayo clinic at Rochester,
Minn., where the affliction was
found to be maglignant brain
tumor. No contributing cause
for this disease is known to med
ical science, and no permanent
cure has yet been discovered.
Though the proficient surgeons
of the Mayo institution were in
attendance, the possibilities of a
successful operation were so
meager that it was not attempted.
Every device was utilized in order
to prolong the sojourn of the
child, but after an almost pain
less illnesss of five weeks there,
he passed away at 8:15 a. m.
May 4th 1916.
The body was brought to Eka
laka, where resides grandmother
Mrs Louisa Miller, uncle Frank
Miller, and two aunts, Mrs. Wal
ter Maxwell and Mrs. Edgar
Ware. Funeral services were
held at the church at 2:00 p. m.
Sunday, May 7th and the body
was laid to rest in the I. O. 0. F.
Cemetery.
The masquerade bali that was
to hjve taken place at the Owens
school house last Saturday eve
ning. was postponed until Satur
day evening, May 13th. A spe
cial invitation is extended to all
to attend. 2t.
