Prize For Flower Gardens
To, encourage the cultivation of
flowers the ladies of . the Womans
Christian Temperance Union have
started a movement in Laclede
whereby prizes are to be given
children who raise the prettiest
bed of flowers. They are also put
ting forth efforts to have flowers
in the public park, one bed having
been made this week. These ladies
are deserving of a great deal of
credit for the effort they are
making to beautify the town.
They are devoting their time as
well as spending money from their
treasury to get this movement
started and it is believed they
should meet with encouragement
in the work they have undertaken
If any of the business men have
prizes to offer for a well kept lawn
or flower bed, tell the ladies about
it and they will see that the right
contestant gets it. Flower seeds
and bulbs will be furnished to
those who do not have them. You
do not have to own your own home
in order to help beautify the town,
any tenant can make a home look
more inviting by having a few
flowers. Let all get behind this
movement and help clean the town
and have flowers growing where
heretofore has been tincan piles
and weed patches. It will pay.
Road Boss Wanted
The township -board held a meet
ing last Tuesday to take action on
some road matters left over from
the regular meeting held last
month. The board has not yet
been able to get a road overseer
for the district southeast of La
clede, where one is badly needed.
With threxCeption of the National
Trail, which is on the township
line, the roads in that district are
about the worst ever. There are
several places on the cross state
highway between Laclede and the
township line that would disgrace
the most obscure by-road, much
less being allowed on a road marked
to guide tourists across the state.
The land owners' along the road
seem to have lost all interest and
are apparently indifferent as to
whether the road is abandoned or
not. What is known as the middle
road leading east from Laclede has
been put in fairly good condition
by the farmers and it has been
marked as the Big" Four trail and
tm effort is being made to have it
designated as the county seat high
way in place of the south road so
that it may get the dragging fund
when the distribution is made.
This will probably be don unless
the south .road is improved at once.
While this is a very busy time it
does seem as if some farmer should
make the sacrifice and accept the
position of ' road boss" that tie
district may not fall behind in the
matter of good roads. ;
