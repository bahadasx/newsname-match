PROGRESS QF THE WAR.
The interesting question of the week
have been the German and American
notes over the submarine issue. The
German answer was satisfactory as to
the principal point in question and pro
mises in future a strict adherance to the
international laws as to warning and
providing for the safty of passengers and
crew. But it was very unsatisfactory in
that it puts the blame of the submarine
warefare as practiced by Germany on
the British,, and practically says to the
United States, if you will stop the Brit
ish blockade there will be no farther
cause for complaint against the German
navy. It also adds a rider to toe effect
that if the British blockade continue
that the imperial government cannot be
answerable for circumstances that may
occur tbe future.
The answer of President Wilson given
out on Tuesday was brief. He accepts
the promise of the Germans to refrain
from the inhuman submarine warfare
and hope that the future will prove
that tbe promise has been made in good
faith. He also adds very pointedly and
emphatically, that the United States is
discussing this matter with Germany
alone. .That what England and her al
lies may do is a question for discussion
with them and not with Germany. Each
nation being responsible to the United
States for its own acts. That in no case
can the aots of Germany be made con
tingent to those of Great Britain, or vice
versa, so far as this country is ooncerned.
A supplementary note from Germany
pnblished yesterday acknowledge that
the "Soaiex" was sunk by a blunder of
the captain of the German submarine
who has been punished, and Germany
will meke reparation.
Things are getting quiet again in Ire
land. A dozen or more of the leaders
of the rebellion have been shot and
•any others condemned to prison. The
great majority of the Irish people seem
to deplore the affair, not only for its im
aediate tragedy but because of the in
ftosnoe it may have on furore Irish legis
lation by Parliament

while the French report some gains and
that the Germans have paid heavily for
any advances. It is reported that there
are about 500,000 men massed on either
bide at this point on a semi-circular bat
tle line about twenty miles long, The
lighting at this place has been almost
continuous since Feb. 21st. Some rea

of the Crown Priuce, and to counteract
tbe suposed great "spring-drive" of the
allies.
The submarines are getting in con
sidsrable work these days, but in most
casf*s the crews are saved.
On the Mexicau border we have the
news of another raid by Mexican bandits
and three small villages in Texas were
robbed by a band of Mexicans who
phouted 'Viva Villa" and "Viva Carran
za" as they pillaged and murdered.
Some four or five Americans lost their
lives. As a result practically all avail
4m able American regulars were called to

—Jos Morrison Drayton ea to the border. We now have about
seven or eight thousand regular troops
in or near Mexico, all we have, count
'era. The affair emphasises the fact
that we must eventually govern Mexico,
—and that we can do it much more sat
isfactorily from the inside than from the
outside. Now we have the pitiful spec
tacle of a' line of soldiers watchfully
waiting along the whole 'Mexican bor
der, to guard our own citizens from ban
dits who are under no laws.
Carranza wants the United States to
say just when the American troops will
be withdrawn from Mexico. Under the
present status the answer ought to be
easy.
HONESTY.
There is a'strong tendency to attribute
ulterior motives to other persons who do
not share in one's own opinions,
This is particularly true in the discus
sion of political questions and of late
among the sympathisers of the different
warring nations of Europe.
In politics the other party i| out for
office and graft. The other party is
composed of ignorant, prejudiced or
profit-seeking people. The leaders of
the other party are all demagogues and
mostly but little better than highway
robbers who are looking for public plun
der.
When we come to the "war-zone" we
find conditions not much better. We
learn that the matter of "preparedness"
(indefinite as that term is) is the result
of a lot of powder and other munition
manufacturers who seek to make war
and war conditions in order to sell goods.
We also discover that our statesmen are
hired servants of either Germany or
Great Britain and that the opinions and
sentiments of the common people are
but the results of a newspaper press
most of which jingle German thalers or
British sovereigns in their pockets as
pay for subsidized jingo. The only
holiest newspaper editors are those which
speak for our party or our side.
All this sort of stuff is self-negative.
This arbitrative sorting of everybody
into "sheep and goats" lacks a bau»
and foundation. A division may be
made it is true, but which party is sheep
and whieh party is goats? There is no
one left to be the judge unless it be the
few persons that have no opinions at all
on publio matters, and who would there
fore necessarily be incompetent as
judges.
It is an apparent absurdity tossy that
all the rogues are in one party and all
the honest men are in another party. It
is equally absurd to make a difference of
opinion a test of any man's honesty.
Any man may be absolutely wrong in bis
and still bo honest

lieve that'.is the best means of keeping
peace. We think that there are also
many other thousands who are opposing
preparedness, because they are con
vinced that preparedness will bring with
it a military spirit that will tend to make
this a warlike nation.
And out of these thousands not one in
a thousand has had his opinions influ
enced in the slightest degree by the
manufacturers of war munitions.
In fact a diversity of opinion among
people is one of the best proofs of hon
esty. The man who agrees with every
body is necessarily a dishonest hypocret.
The man *vho has no opinions isn't any
body and cuts no figure. He is neither
You must efen give the devil his due
—if you want to be honest yourself.
REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE MEET
As per call of the county chairman,
Dr. James, the Republican committee
men "and others interested in the party
met at Cavalier last Friday to discuss
matters pertaining to the coming cam*
paign. There were representatives from
most parts Of the county and tbe inter
est taken shows that they mean to push
a vigorous campaign for success at tbe
polls. Prom the number of farmers pres
ent it is evident that there area good
many still adhearing to the principles of
the G. O. P. and who have no intention
of joining the Nonprotestant" party, as
we are told it is nicknamed in some lo
calities.
A straight Republican ticket from top
to bottom was advocated and everybody
'seemed to be in favor of it. While the
gathering was purely informal a ticket
was outlined and those whose names
were selected were requested to circulate
petitions according to law. But it was
understood that the suggestions outlined
should not interfere with anyone else
coming out as candidates on tbe ticket
nor should it be construed that tbe meet
ing favored any one person by the selec
tion.
The following list of candidates were
selected for legislative ticket: A.J. Mc
Fadden, senator if. W. Husband, Peter
McMillan and F. M. King, representa
tives. Tiie county ticket includes the
present set of officers, with W. J. Burke
of Bathgats as states attorney added.
Mr. Burke was there in person and made
the statement that he did not seek the
nomination but if it was the desire of
the party for him to run he would ac
cept, and a petition was started signed
by all present. Auditor Felson read a
communication from the secretary of
state relative to the senatorial situation
in the First district wherein he construes
the law that it is escential that a sena
tor be elected this year. Reference was
made to the fact that the legislature is
the place where a senator's elegibility to
his seat is finally settled, however.
A DIFFERENCE IN BLOCKADES
A large part of the German answer to
the President's note concerning subma
rine warfare is devoted to the subject of
the tlockade by tbe English fleet and
argues that so far as humanity id involv
ed, that the preventing of food supplies
reaching Germany and thereby starving
women and children is just as inhuman
as to sink a passenger ship withput
warning. At first thought this would
seem so to be. But there is a great dif
ference. When a passenger ship is tor
pedoed without warning the crew and
passengers are given no alternative.. It
becomes only a question of luck or fate
what becomes of them. They are giv
en no opportunity of surrender.
But in the case of a blockade of a
country, or the siege of a city there is al
ways the alternative of surrender. Not
a pleasant alternative it is very true,
but the choice of life and dearth left with
those who are suffering from the block*
ade or the siege. Germany can have her
ports opened to the world at any time if
she is williug to make tbe necessary con
cessions to the allies.
The laws of war since wars were, have
always been that there should always be
an opportunity of surrender, and sur
render should insure the lives of the
captured.
One way of criticism of the records of
publio men is by publishing a list of
legislative bills for which he hss or has
not voted. Unless tbe reader is well ac
quainted with these bills, not only with
thoir objeots but also how they ars word
ed, he gets very little real knowledge of
the facts. Often the heading and pre*
ambit of a bill is very misleading as to
what would be actual results it the bill
became a law. A legislator might fsvor
the object of the bill but be oppotld fill
good reasons to its methods.

PEMBINA, PEMBINA COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, FRIDAY, MAY 12th,
THE FIGURES.
The tables containing the financial
statement of the county are repeated in
this issue because of their general inter
est to taxpayers. Auditor Felson evi
dently revels in statistical figures, and
has added to the regular tables a large
number of exhibits which show compari
sons in rapk, in assessed values, popula
tion, etc. which is of interest to every
body. Your township, your city, your
village, your school district is there with
its population, assessed valuatibn and
tax levy. In these you have a personal
interest, in the others you have the
opportunity of comparison. It is un-.
doubtedly the best and most compre
hensive statement that has ever been
published in this county and every tax
payer should not only examine it but
preserve it. Auditor Felson deserves
muoh credit for the labor expended in'
tbe compilation of these incidental and
valuable exhibits.
We are in receipt of a circular issued
from tbe executive office at Bismarck
setting forth the finances of tbe state
which contains a volume of information.
It is a copy of the reoords and it shows
that there has been an actual decrease
ia state taxes per capita, bnt the In
cifase whieh has bsen made a promin*
eft issue against Governor Hanna and
